Senate Assembly Committees.
The meeting began with
a presentation from Chief

Information Technology
Council established a strategic
plan to provide tools and an
environment that facilitates

innovation, engagement and
integrative learning on campus.
To accomplish this goal,
the University has considered
joining a consortium known
as Unizin, which would

ANN ARBOR
City council
bans smoking
in public areas

With 9-2 vote,
long-debated
ordinance takes
effect in A2
By MATT JACKONEN
Daily StaffReporter
A smoke-free Ann Arbor is
finally here - or at least one
more free of smoke.
The Ann Arbor City Council
passed the long-debated
smoking ordinance Monday
night by a vote of 9-2 with only
Councilmembers Jane Lumm
(I-Ward 2) and Jack Eaton
(D-Ward 4) voting against the
ordinance.
The ordinance now makes
smoking near bus stops and
within 20 feet of city buildings
a civil infraction.
Thoughthe first draftof the
ordinance contained wording
that also made smoking with-
in 20 feet of bus stops illegal, a
late amendment by ordinance

sponsor Chuck Warpehoski
(D-Ward 5) reduced the dis-
tance to 10 feet from bus stops.
Warpehoski said after speak-
ing with AAATA officials, it
was agreed that a 20-foot buf-
fer might prevent bus drivers
from seeing smokers who are
also waiting for buses.
The ordinance will also
prohibit smoking in certain
areas of Ann Arbor parks
at the discretion of the city
administrator.
Councilmember Stephen
Kunselman (D-Ward 3) pro-
posed an amendment to
decrease the fine for ignoring
any warning from a police offi-
cer to cease smoking in pro-
hibited areas from $50 to $25.
"Fifty dollars may be
disparate to some of the
(citizens) that may be most
likely to receive the fine,"
Kunselman said.
He added that the fine for
smoking a cigarette should
not be higher than the fine for
smoking marijuana, as smok-
ing a cigarette is actuallylegal.

detailed policy plan April 16 high-
lighting his education plan that he
hopes to implement if elected.
The six-page outline states that
Michigan must start to reverse

policy note refers to the 2012 $930
million spending cut Snyder made

In the last Ford School
Policy Talk of the academic
year, Margo Picken, a Towsley
Foundation Policymaker in
Residence, and John Ciorciari,
a Public Policy assistant

professor, discussed the
controversy surrounding the
United Nations-backed Khmer

Public Policy Prof. Susan

According to Ciorciari, from
1975 to 1979, as many as 2.5
million people out of a popu-

starvation, over-work, disease,

torture and execution in the

Prof. examines art through history

EndiPoskovic teaches at the Penny
W. Stamps School of Art £t Design
and has a joint appointment with
the center for Russian, East Euro-
pean and Eurasian studies. He
teaches both undergraduate and
graduate courses in art and design
and is a student adviser.
Tell me about the topic course
you occasionally teach.
The topic course that I taught
,was called Persuasive Graphics
and it focused on graphic arts
production in central and East-
ern Europe during what was
considered the Communist era
in Eastern Europe: a period dur-
ing which graphic arts worked in
the range of fields and produced

graphic imagery, which subse-
quently developed toward more
politically charged imagery. So
the idea was to expose students
to a certain graphic vernacular
that developed over the course
of several decades, culminating
in what was a very politically
charged message that essentially
brought about political changes
throughout Eastern Europe.
What work do you do as an art-
ist when you aren't teaching?
I'm a graphic artist; I work in
printmaking; I make my own
images. Oftentimes my own
images explore different themes
that I carry through many cycles
and many years. I work in block

printing - woodcut as well as
lithography - and I make images
that sometimes work as singular
images but sometimes as a series
of images. And most recently I've
been working on animated films
that are based on my graphic
images.
How has transitioning to ani-
mated films been?
I've collaborated with other
people who work primarily in
animation to explore how to
animate certain images that I've
produced, or turned them into
longer narratives and that's what
I've been able to explore in recent
years.

One year after
bombing, Boston
Marathon endures
In show of resilience,
more than 32,000 run,
compete in 2014 marathon \

MARY SCHWALM/AP
r---

BOSTON (AP) - Some ran to
honorthe dead and wounded. Oth-
ers were out to prove something to
the world about their sport, the city
or their country. And some wanted
to prove somethingtothemselves.
With the names of the victims
scrawled on their bodies or their
race bibs, more than 32,000 peo-
ple ran in the Boston Marathon
on Monday in a powerful show
of defiance a year after the deadly
bombing.
"We're marathon runners. We
know how to endure," said Dennis
Murray, a 62-year-old health care
administrator from Atlanta who
finished just before the explo-
sions last year and came back to
run again. "When they try to take
our freedom and our democracy,
we come back stronger."
The two pressure cooker
bombs that went off near the end
of the 26.2-mile course last year
killed three people and wounded
more than 260 in a spectacle of
torn limbs, acrid smoke and bro-
ken glass. But the city vowed to
return even stronger, and the vic-
tory by Meb Keflezighi - the first

American in 31 years to win the
men's race - helped deliver on
that promise.
On Twitter, President Barack
Obama congratulated Keflezighi
and Shalane Flanagan, the top
American finisher among the
women, "for making America
proud!"
"All of today's runners showed
the world the meaning of #Bos-
tonStrong," Obama wrote.
The race was held under
extraordinary security, including
100 new surveillance cameras,
more than 90 bomb-sniffing dogs
and officers posted on roofs.
As runners continued to drag
themselves across the finish line
in the late afternoon, more than
six hours into the race, state
emergency officials reported no
security threats other than some
unattended bags.
Kenya's Rita Jeptoo won the
women's race in a course-record
2 hours, 18 minutes, 57 seconds,
defending the title she won last
year but could not celebrate
because of the tragedy.
Keflezighi, who did not run last

year because of an injury, won the
main event this year in 2:08:37.
A 38-year-old U.S. citizen who
emigrated from Eritrea as a boy,
Keflezighi wrote the names of the
three dead on his bib along with
that of the MIT police officer
killed during the manhunt.
As he was presented with the
trophy and golden laurel wreath,
"The Star-Spangled Banner"
echoed over Boylston Street,
where the explosions rang out a
year ago.
"I came as a refugee, and the
United States gave me hope," said
Keflezighi, who was welcomed
by fans chanting "U.S.A.!" 'This
is probably the most meaningful
victory for an American, because
of what happened last year."
At 2:49 p.m., the time of the
first explosion, the crowd at the
finish line observed a moment of
silence - then broke into some
of the loudest cheers of the day,
with whooping, clapping and the
clanging of cowbells.
This year's starting field of
32,408 included 600 people who
were given special invitations

for those who were "profoundly
impacted" by the attacks, and
almost 5,000 runners who were
stopped on the course last year
when the bombs went off.
"TodaywhenIgottothatpoint,
I said, 'I have to do some unfin-
ished business,"' said runner Vicki
Schmidt, 52, of Nashville. She
added: "You can't hold us back.
You can't get us down. Boston is
magical. This is our place."
Some of the victims themselves
returned for a ceremonial crossing
of the finish line.
"It was hard. It was really
hard," said Heather Abbott, who
wore a "Boston Strong" sticker
on the black prosthesis where
her left leg used to be. "I was
really nervous. I didn't want to
fall.... I'm just glad we made it."
Tatyana McFadden, who was 6
and sickly when she was adopted
out of a Russian orphanage by
an American, won the women's
wheelchair race for the second
straight year. Afterward, she spoke
of Martin Richard, the 8-year-old
boy who was the youngest of those
killed in the explosions.

SUTTONS BAY TOWNSHIP, Mich.
Native American
man's skull turned
over to tribe
A skull that was apparently
passed downthrough generations
of a northern Michigan family
has been turned over to an Indian
group ina repatriation ceremony.
The family doesn't want
its name known, according to
Leelanau County Sheriff Mike
Borkovich. He told the Traverse
City Record-Eagle that the family
gave the skull to his office in
Sutton's Bay Township in the
northwestern Lower Peninsula.
The skull had been in the
family for years, Borkovich said.
He said an elderly family member
died and younger members didn't
want it.
According to family lore, a
family member was a mariner
on the Great Lakes, the sheriff
said. He said the family member
stopped at Beaver Island, where a
Native American offered him the
skull, according to the story.
DETROIT
Judge interviews
experts in Detroit
bankruptcy
A former New York lieutenant
governor was among the
candidates interviewed Friday as
a possible expert in the Detroit
bankruptcy case.
Judge Steven Rhodes said he
wants a set of fresh, experienced
eyes to offer opinions as Detroit
tries to emerge from bankruptcy
this year, and questioned Richard
Ravitch and others Friday in
court. Rhodes said during the
proceedings that he expected to
decide later Friday or by Monday,
but a court spokesman said in
a statement afterward that no
timetable for a decision was
determined.
Ravitch, 80, has had a long
career in public service and
has been outspoken about
financial risks faced by states
and local governments. He
told The Associated Press that
many promises no longer are

With the chance to apply for
hundreds of millions of dollars
in federal help set to expire in a
few months, even Obama's home
state of Illinois is expressing
little interest in taking the next

step. The law's disastrous rollout
and lingering unpopularity have
made it risky to raise the issue
in a tense election year despite
Obama's announcement Thurs-
day that 8 million Americans
have signed up for subsidized pri-
vate insurance.

addresses the issue of public
school improvement, taking aim
at how budget cuts have forced
cuts in art and music programs.
In his release, Schauer suggest-
ed bringing back these "impor-
tant" subjects to public schools,
as well as hoping to implement
plans to help teachers improve
their skills and supporting year-
round schools. The policy note
also outlined a plan to put Mich-
igan on the path to a universal
pre-school.
To fund his education poli-
cies, Schauer proposed a study to
determine the cost of adequately
educating a child in a public
school. He will use this study
as a guideline to determine how
much money must be spent on
K-12 students, suggesting pos-
sible changes to Michigan's Tax
Proposal A, a 1994 reform which
shifted public school funding
from property taxes to state

sales taxes.
With regard to higher educa-
tion, Schauer proposed increas-
ing financial support for state
universities and community col-
leges and offering scholarships
to students who dual enroll, are
in technical training or doing
college-technical coursework.
Though detailed in its aims,
the policy plan provided no
clear funding plans. Emily
Benavides, communications
director for Rick Snyder's
campaign team, Rick for
Michigan, called the policy plan
a "campaign brochure" and said
its vague wording and unclear
budget planning demonstrate
Schauer's insufficient
leadership skills.
"What voters can take away
from this proposal is Schauer
demonstrating once again that
he's unprepared," Benavides
said. "He is not prepared to talk
about implementation and fol-
lowing through on policy and
that's something that governor
Snyder has been doing for the
past three years."

Center to discuss present concerns and future expectations for the new center.

to the larger issues of diversity
and how the New Trotter Center
could help in changing racial cli-
mate on campus.
"This is the beginning of a
process that is going to be sus-
tained," he said. "It is about
much more than just a building."
Broad issues regarding cam-
pus climate were introduced in
the large group dialogue to start
the meeting. Multiple students
reiterated feelings of frustration
regarding the level of awareness
about Trotter itself, and the work
that they're doing to improve
it. They said the University,
and overall student body, must
acknowledge there is a problem
and commit to making it a priori-
ty before a solution can be found.
Students then broke into
smaller groups, each one tar-
geting a different issue intro-

duced in the initial conversation.
Groups focused on how the New
Trotter Center could address
these issues.
Suggestions included relo-
cating the center and including
information about the center in
campus tours to increase acces-
sibility and draw more students
into the Trotter community.
Public Policy senior Fernando
Coello, a member of the New
Trotter core team, said the meet-
ing was useful in allowing the
student body to know who the
consultants are and where they
come from.
Moving forward, students
working on the project said they
want to focus on engaging even
more of the campus community
in the upcoming fall semester.
Engineering freshman Logan
Pratt suggested providing infor-
mation to incoming students at
summer orientation as a way to
build awareness of the Trotter
Center.

LSA freshman Victoria Verel-
len said while it is important
to continue the conversation
throughout the summer, the pri-
ority should be to enact changes
when more students are on cam-
pus to participate.
"We don't want to limit the
voices that are heard by doing
this work over the summer," she
said.
Overall, core team members
said they were pleased with the
conversation and value consul-
tants placed on hearing student
input.
Rackham student Maite Villa-
real said though the process will
be long, she is glad the University
is taking action.
"We're moving from the stage
of things being a frustration and.
a conversation and an idea to a
reality," she said.
Another town hall meeting
will be held today from 11 a.m.
to 1 p.m. at the Trotter Multicul-
tural Center.

Karen Staller, outgoing chair

delivered a speech detailing
her experience with University
President-elect Mark Schlissel,
and discussed her experience
with SACUA and the importance
of central faculty governance in
university administration.
"Today, rather than sum-
marizing on past accomplish-
ments, I would like to focus on
the future ... in preparation for
my meeting with the President-
elect in March, he expressed
that what he's really interested
in are two things: what issues
most important to University
faculty, and how might we best
work together," Staller said.
"Mark expressed eagerness to

be better spent solving these
current-day problems.
Rackham student Brock
Redpath said he attended the
event because of his interest
in the Khmer Rouge Trials and
its impact on students.
"Some of the precedents
that are set abroad can have
ramifications on us at later
times," Redpath said.
Though the trials have
directly impacted those, who
involved in the genocide in
Cambodia, Ciorciari said its
effects reaches University stu-
dents as well.
"As for students here at
Michigan, it has affected
a number of them directly
because they're gone to Cam-
bodia to work on them for
internships or after they grad-
uate, and they become a part of
this solution which has to be
multi-faceted," Ciorciari said.
experiment with different ways
of interacting with faculty and
soliciting ideas. It was clear from
the start that he mostly wanted
to listen and learn."
Staller referenced the strength
of the faculty senate at Universi-
ty of California, Berkeley, where
Schlissel was a professor and
dean. At UC Berkeley, deans'
offices have less power and facul-
ty governance plays very central
role. In contrast, the University
of Michigan has a more promi-
nent dean system, with faculty
governance playing a more mod-
est role.
She also discussed the vital-
ity of a central government that
operates with consensus and
unity.
"Central faculty governance
often concerns itself with a ques-
tion that boils down to this,"
Staller said. "When is the com-
mon good at stake such that it
ought to trump unit-specific
interests?"
Before adjourning the meet-
ing, Scott Masten, the incom-
ing SACUA chair, expressed his
and his fellow SACUA members'
appreciation for Staller's work
throughout the year.

SMOKING
From Page 1A
There is now also an option for
completing community service
in lieu of a fine.
Notably, all four of the city
councilmembers running for
mayor this fall voted in favor of
the ordinance. Before Monday
night, only Kunselman still felt
strongly enough about his reser-
vations to vote against the pro-
posal.
However, Kunselman said the
lower fine along with the assur-
ances of the "self-enforcing"
nature of the ordinance from the
variety of health officials at the
last council meeting caused him
to change his mind.
The loudest criticisms came
from Lumm, who still held
doubts about the enforcement
issue. She said any type of
enforcement would be a waste
of police officers' time and noted
that the claims of self-enforce-
ment warrant the conclusion
that an ordinance is unneces-
sary.
"If it's self-enforcing, why
have it with any fines at all?"
Lumm said. "If the ... incidents
are so rare, doesn't that suggest
the problem is a minor one and
not one requiring an ordinance
to deal with it?"
Lumm added that council
should not "punt" the decision of
which parks to make smoke-free
to the city administrator since it
is a "big deal" for many citizens.
Eaton echoed Lumm's dis-
taste for the ordinance by call-
ing for educational reform
rather than making smoking a
civil infraction.
"We are going to devote our
police resources to enforcing
what is primarily a public health
question," Eaton said. "Pub-
lic health questions are better
addressed through education,
which is demonstrated in the
population that (primarily) still
smokes: the uneducated and
poor. We need to educate them."

Eaton also agreed that the
ordinance is "too broad in
scope," and expressed his con-
cern with the disparate impact
on the poor - whom he noted
also primarily ride the bus.
Councilmember Christopher
Taylor (D-Ward 3) said the
ordinance is primarily intended
to allow non-smokers to cre-
ate social norms that ultimately
educate smokers and could
prevent others from taking up
smoking.
"It is not a tremendous bur-
den on people," Taylor said. "It
also, nevertheless, provides non-
smokers with the tools to help
educate smokers in these areas
as to what is appropriate in pub-
lic space and what is not."
Sabra Briere (D-Ward 1) also
spoke in favor of the resolution,
and said that itsimply "promotes
civility" between smokers and
non-smokers by allowing for
more harmony through under-
standing.
Jeff Hayner, an Ann Arbor
resident and previous candidate
for the open Ward 1 city coun-
cil seat in 2013, said the City
Council should consider adding
agum-chewingban to the smok-
ing ordinance due to the larger
amount of used-gum litter ver-
sus cigarette butts.
Besides the vote and discus-
sion over the ordinance at the
meeting, City Administrator
Steve Powers presented the
annual budget recommenda-
tions for the upcoming 2015
fiscal year at the start of the
meeting.
Powers recommendedthe city
spend $98.1 million with $95.3
million coming from revenues
and the $2.8 million difference
from the unassigned general
fund. However, the recurring
expenditures match the recur-
ring revenues.
Notable additions to the bud-
get include recommendations to
hire three more police officers,
another firefighter and an addi-
tional rental-housing inspector
for tenant safety.

Stowaway raises
security concerns

Boy flew on flight
to Hawaii in
jetliner's wheel well
SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - A
15-year-old boy found his way
onto an airport's tarmac and
climbed into a jetliner's wheel
well, then flew for five freezing
hours to Hawaii - a misadven-
ture that forced authorities to
take a hard look at the secu-
rity system that protects the
nation's airline fleet.
The boy, who lives in Santa
Clara, Calif., hopped out of the
left rear wheel well of a Boeing
767 on the Maui airport tar-
mac Sunday, according to the
FBI. Authorities found the high
school student wandering the
airport grounds with no iden-
tification. He was questioned
by the FBI and taken by ambu-
lance to a hospital, where he
was found to be unharmed.
FBI spokesman Tom Simon
in Honolulu said the teen
climbed into the left rear wheel
well of the first plane he saw in

San Jose.
"He got very lucky that he
got to go to Maui but he was not
targeting Maui as a destina-
tion," Simon said.
He passed out in the air and
didn't regain consciousness
until an hour after the plane
landed in Hawaii, Simon said.
When he came to, he climbed
out of the wheel well and was
immediately seen by airport
personnel who escorted him
inside where he was inter-
viewed by the FBI, Simon said.
It was not immediately
clear how the boy stayed alive
in the unpressurized space,
where temperatures at cruis-
ing altitude can fall well below
zero and the air is too thin for
humans to stay conscious. An
FAA study of stowaways found
that some survive by going into
a hibernation-like state.
On Monday, authorities
tried to determine how the
boy slipped through multiple
layers of security, including
wide-ranging video surveil-
lance, German shepherds and
Segway-riding police officers.

What about the color green?

An alternate history

leopatra's image is mostly
associated with dramatic
eye makeup, shoulder-
length dark hair
and an elaborate
golden crown,
all adorning
a face that
could conquer
powerful men.
This image of
Cleopatra has NIVEDITA
been deeply KARKI
ingrained in our
brains through
popular culture.
This semester, I took a mini
course in classical civilization
titled CLCIV 125 - Cleopatra.
What prompted me to take this
class was the fact that Cleopatra
was a pharaoh of Egypt and ruled
an entire kingdom, but the only
concept that I'd been brought up
to associate with her name was
immeasurable beauty. Her name
ignited the image of a person whose
face could mesmerize anyone.
I consider myself a feminist.
I've been writing my column for
The Michigan Daily in my pursuit
to attract female students to
technology and entrepreneurship,
and to call on the University to
recognize the gender imbalance
currently in place in computer
science, my intended major. Thus,
the perception of Cleopatra was
one that perpetuated one of the
ideas that I've been fighting all this
time; the idea that in order to be
powerful, to do anything of mass
significance, a woman has to be
beautiful. The idea that in order
to be remembered in the pages of
history, a woman's appearance had
to be able to charm and attract.
There's one important similarity
that I've noticed between the
history of technology and the
history associated with Cleopatra,
what we know has come through
ages of documentation made by a
single, like-minded majority: men.
Specifically, Caucasian, European
men. For women in technology,
this has meant that their names
have faded from the rich history of
computer science (did you know the
first ever computer programmer
was a female?), and for Cleopatra
this meant that the focus shifted
from her work as a pharaoh
to her relationships and her
physical appearance.
Among the texts I read in

my class, several cite Greek- though Egyptian culture accepted

Hunting for more than eggs

The two most sleepless nights
of my childhood were a yearly
occurrence. Fueling my insomnia
was anticipation. One night,
Christmas Eve, was for the
surprises Santa Claus would bring,
and the other was the night before
Easter, for the hidden colored eggs
I would soon search for.
Both are excitingto a small child,
but I took a particular fondness to
searching for Easter eggs. It's a
completely ridiculous exercise and
to this day I still have no idea what
the meaning of an Easter egg hunt
is, but it was the perfect activity
for the completely ridiculous child
that I was. Because in my mind, I
was the best Easter egg finder there
ever was.
My strategies were methodical.
My system was infallible. Every
inch was scanned, every closet
opened, every drawer checked,
every room meticulously covered
until the two dozen colored eggs
had emerged. It didn't matter
where they were hidden: behind all
of the soup cans, in the microwave
or on top of a lamp twice my height,
none of them could evade my egg-
hunting prowess.
Even outside of colored eggs,
I've spent a lot of time trying to

find things. Trying to find things
is a lot of what education is. I dis-
covered that when given an equa-
tion, I could find 'x' pretty easily,
and before I knew itIwas in college
studying engineering, trying to find
more things.
But finding things is tiring.
Eventually finding the eggs becomes
a laborious task, done to prevent a
forgotten egg from rotting away in its
hiding spot. Some can live a fulfilling
life of findingthings, but as I went on
I continued to think that maybe the
"finding life" wasn't for me.
As the oldest of four siblings, I
had mastered the art of pretending
to believe in Santa and the Easter
bunny. Even though they would leave
out the best cookies they made for
Santa, it was still slightly depressing
to eat the cookies, tricking them into
thinking it was the jolly old man. But
far less depressing was hiding Easter
eggs for my youngest siblings.
Finding the most ridiculous
spots to hide an egg was a blast.
It was the same enjoyment I once
experienced when uncovering the
eggs was flipped, and scheming to
find the craziest hiding spots and
thinking of the laughter my siblings
would have when they uncovered
it. The same laughter of my own

childhood. The contentment in
being the egg hunter had been
replaced with that of the egghider.
Just like the eggs, one thing I've
found out from myyears of education
is that I've always loved watching
and helping others find things.
Learning material is wonderful,
but explaining it to others and
watching them understand is much
more enjoyable.
I've spent much of my time at
school volunteering with high
school students as a tutor, a mentor
and someone to help them not just
find 'x' but their own path. And
the chance to help them find these
things, the chance to perhaps
inspire them, is why I do it. The
excitement of seeing my siblings
find the Easter eggs, the lightbulb
moment of a student when he or she
figures outa solution, is why I want
to teach.
For now, I'm still on the path
of an engineering degree that my
application out of high school put
me on. Perhaps I have more things
to find for myself, but one day I'll
find my way backto the classroom, to
teach students to find their own way.
David Harris is an
Engineering sophomore.

I don't know at what point it truly dawned
on me. As I recall, it was more an accumulation
of little hints and tip-offs throughout my
first year at Michigan before it finally hit me,
without mercy.
If I had to choose a specific point, it could
have been when I realized I could never afford
to move in with my friends the following year
at Landmark. It could have been earlier than
that, during Winter Break, when everyone
was booking their plane tickets back home
to places like San Diego and the coasts of
New Jersey. Or it could have been later, when
conversation began centering on which uncle
or whose friend's mom everyone was going to
get in contact with about a summer internship.
These were the sorts of characteristics of
a color of people that I began to find myself
in regular contact with. They all spoke a
different type of language. They said things
like "closed party," "my cousin at Columbia"
and "what's FASFA?"
When I return to my hometown in metro
Detroit, I am vigorously reminded of the
differences between my upbringing and the
upbringings of my green classmates. For
the first time, I compared my uniformed
1,000-square-foot home to the Snapchats in my
inbox of faraway places with manicured pools
and Congressmen neighbors. I started to resent
the necessity of my school-year employment I
had previously thought was the norm. I began
to feel that I was entitled to a trip to Europe
on my parents' bill, because that's what I was
hearing from my greener counterparts.
From these same people I hear, "Michigan
was my fall-back school," "I can't go to Detroit,
I'll get shot," or "The only thing decent in

this state is the University." It's degrading to
students like myself, who owe their success
to their father's manufacturing job in the
automotive industry and in-state tuition.
Straddling two cultures, while at the same
time questioning which one it is you actually
belong to, is as confusing as it is domineering.
whenever I see my own elderly neighbors,
my friends at home and favorite high school
teacher, they all raise their eyebrows and make
sure to ask me, "how is itngoing over there at the
big school?" When I'm back in metro Detroit,
I am distinguished by my accomplishments at
Michigan. But when I'm in Ann Arbor, Iam put
down with subconscious comments.
But I am now a rising senior, and am
accustomed to socializing with students
whose skin color is not just black, brown,
yellow or white, but also green. Though my
interactions with vibrant greens initially
discontented me with the reflection of my
own duller shade, today I know that it has
increased my understanding of colors that are
not just synonymous with race, but that are
also propagated through income brackets. My
experiences at Michigan sometimes dilute
my perception of wealth distribution. But my
studies at Michigan have taught me that even
being a dull shade of green still means being
exponentially more privileged than the vast
majority of others throughout the rest of the
state, country and world.
Michigan students are black, brown,
white, yellow, red, orange, gray, purple and
green. But most importantly, we are all maize
and blue.
Kristen Anderson is ans LSA junior.


I wasn't just doing it for myself, but for my
city, my family and my nation, and there's
no better motivation."
- Boston Marathon runner Shalane Flanagan said at a news conference after finishing the 2014 race.
The 118th running of iconic American marathon took place one year after the tragic bombings in April 2013.

filming, and we really got in good
shape. And we did boxing and a
lot of cardio," Peltz said.
"Physically and mentally
and psychologically, it's - yes,
just kind of a hard process to go
through. But we had alot of sup-
port on it as well, you know, and
it was all good," Reynor added.
Being able to guide the "Trans-
formers" franchise in a new
direction made all the challenges
worth it. Peltz and Reynor stated
that the fusion of the original
films' and the fourth film's plots
would appeal to both previous
audiences and new ones.
"This is just as much, if not
more, action-packed than any
of the three previous films,"
Reynor said. "Again, you know,
we're revisiting some of the most
beautiful cars in the world in this
film, and, you know, people who
are fans of the automotive indus-
try are certainly going to want to
reengage with the series at this
stage."
And beyond its entertain-
ment appeal, Peltz and Reynor
explained that "Transformers:
Age of Extinction" also says
important things about the world
we live in today.
"This 'Transformers' is a little
bit darker than the previous ones
were maybe, and I think that it
- I think that you're going to see
the Autobots in this movie maybe
reflect a little bit of a sense of
anger and resentment that might
be something that we see in con-
temporary society, particularly
in the United States," Reynor
said.
The film gives out a lighter
message too.
"In this film, you see that I get
separated from my dad, and at
the end of the movie you just see
it come together so beautifully,"
Peltz said. "That really shines in
this film. It has a really beautiful
human element to it."

The bubble is a difficult place to
be in.When the writers don't know
whether their show is coming back
for another year,
it leads them to
go one of two
ways: end the Parenthood
show on a huge
cliffhanger that Season Finale
dares the net- Available for
work to renew streaming
the series or NBC
have a quiet
finale that, while
not providing complete closure,
ties up enough loose ends that it
doesn't feel like the viewer is left
hanging. "Parenthood" usually
opts for the latter kind of finale,
and this season was no exception.
While these finales don't set up
much for the next season, they
serve as reminders of the warmth
and genuine feels that the show
produces each episode.
An interesting thing that the
"Parenthood" writers typically do
with their finales is throw in some-
thing completely unexpected in
order to increase hype surround-
ing the final hour. This season,
the twist involved the return of
Haddie Braverman (Sarah Ramos,
"Private Practice"), who, after
only being mentioned on one or
two occasions this year, returned
home from college with her girl-
friend (nodoubtsothatNBC could
include shots of them kissing in
the promos). While the storyline
did feel shoehorned into the epi-
sode, it provided great trademark
moments for Ramos and Monica
Potter ("Boston Legal"), as she told
her daughter she would accept her
no matter what.
The show didn't forget about its
other ongoing stories, providing
payoff for some, yet not allowing
them to completely close. Hank
(Ray Romano, "Men of a Certain
Age") and Sarah (Lauren Graham,
"Gilmore Girls") finally kissed,

'Dangerously' good 'Years'

By GRACE HAMILTON
DailyArts Writer
"I .had never heard of cli-
mate change," said Nellie Mon-
tez from Plainview, Texas, now
unemployed
after the clos- A
ing of a Cargill
meatpacking Years(of
plant, which Ling
killed another
2,300 jobs with Dangerously
it. Plainview S
had been suf- Sundays at
fering from a 10 p.m.
drought for the Sh.wime
last three years
and could no
longer grow the wheat necessary
to keep the plant alive. Montez
was forced to learn something
new.
"Years of Living Dangerous-
ly," a nine part Showtime docu-
mentary series that premiered
on April 14, explores stories like
this one across the world from
Texas to Syria. The focus is our
changing climate; the damage
that has already been done and
that which is yet to come. These
stories are woven together to
create what Showtime is brand-
ing as "the biggest story of our
time." The hope is that audiences
will come to agree.
The show is a remarkable
combination of efforts. Execu-
tive producers include James
Cameron and Arnold Schwar-
zenegger. Hollywood actors like

Harrison Ford, Don Cheadle and
Matt Damon help play the role
of investigative reporters, along
with today's leading journalists,
like New York Times columnist
Thomas Friedman. Each inves-
tigator takes on a different case,
narrating their travels and expe-
rience, and the heart of the issue
is poked at with more depth than
the camera itself presents.
The first episode follows three
different stories, whose central
issues range from politics to reli-
gion. These important variations
underscore the near incompre-
hensible complexity of climate
change and the reason why
approaching it effectively has
brought so many challenges.
The series is taking a new
approach to get people to pay
attention. Whether it's the stars
that pull you in, the producers,
an interest in the issue itself or
just an attempt to get educated,
this series will satisfy, provid-
ing both explanation and per-
spective. Powerful images, like
praying and singing families in
Plainview, an unprotected 86
thousand hectors of burnt forest
in Indonesia and the unsettling
signs of war crossing the Syrian
border, are reminders of where
we might find ourselves in the
future. "Years of Living Danger-
ously" throws this reality direct-
ly in our face.
At the same time, it also does
an excellent job dispelling popu-
lar myths with sensitivity. That

God is the cause of droughts,
for example, is a sentiment that
echoes throughout the episode.
This is an opinion shared by
many Americans: climate change
is a fallacy. Many of those who
share this belief are introduced
in the episode. Still, there are
exceptions, such as the evangeli-
cal minister who preaches about
the dangers of climate change.
This minister is a powerful rep-
resentation of the way that prog-
ress needs to happen in America.
Faith and science aren't nec-
essarily incompatible and don't
have to be. Accepting the reality
of climate change does not mean
sacrificing other values and mor-
als. Therefore, adaptation will
mean more than changing our
behavior, like recycling and cut-
ting back on plastic; it means a
radical change of mindset - or
at least that's what the showrun-
ners are trying to get across.
The changes necessary now
are far more expansive than
most realize and demand revi-
sion in our economic system and
everyday life. What is happen-
ing in other parts of the country
and world, whatever the physical
distance might be, should be at
the height of our priorities here
today. It is pure foolishness, to
borrow Friedman's adjective,
to believe anything else, and
even more so not to act. That
being said, if you are in need of
reminder, "Years of Living Dan-
gerously" will do so with care.

6 - Tuesday, April 22, 2014 The Michigan Daily - michigandailycom

By DAILY TV STAFF
Spring has arrived in Ann Arbor.
The sun is shining, the snow has
melted and students are emerging
from their dorm rooms to lounge in
the Diag - at least until the stress
of exam weekbanishes us all to our
respective study spots. With the
beautiful weather and the looming
threat of finals in the air, TV might
not exactly be your top priority.
Luckily, it's always our top prior-
ity. As we prepare to say goodbye
for thesummer vacation, The Daily
TV/New Media staff is offering up
a master list of the TV shows - old
and new - that we're most looking
forward to in the coming months.

24: Live Another Day
FOX - May 5 at 9 p.m.
"24: Live Another Day" prom-
ises the return of Jack Bauer
(Kiefer Sutherland, "Touch") for
another badass adventure framed
around a 24 hour time period. In
this case, it'll be loosely framed, as
this anticipated summer TV show
is merely a 12-episode miniseries
(versus the 24-episode seasons
during the show's initial eight sea-
son run). Even if the show doesn't
entirely capture the original for-
mat, it'll surely capture the great
action, tension and out-right cool
moments that helped make "24"
such a fun show to watch.
-Joe Reinhard

Louie
FX - May 5 at 10 p.m.
It's been a year and a half since
the third season of Louis C.K.'s
groundbreaking, heartbreaking,
Emmy-winning "Louie" ended.
After a string of winning episodes
- including the three-part saga of
Louie's fictional audition for David
Letterman's "Late Show" and an
impromptu trip to Beijing - C.K.
ended the season needing a break.
The actor-writer-director-produc-
er-editor requested an extended
hiatus to get some much-needed
time away from work to reflect and
restore creatively. And while it's
understandable that someone so
heavily involved in every aspect of

the creative process needed a little
time off, his absence in the televi-
sion world has been sorely felt. One
of the most insightful comedies on
television, "Louie" will consistent-
ly make you laugh and cry (often at
the same time) all summer long.
-Maddie Thomas
Orange Is the New Black
Netflix - June 6
If the trailer is any indication,
shit is about to go down in the
upcoming season of "Orange Is
the New Black." But we already
knew that - after last year's heart-
thumping, genre-bending entry
into the lacking (a.k.a. nonexistent)

egory, Jenji Kohan is getting ready
to up the ante with a new slate of
summer episodes reuniting her
with a rightfully rabid fan base.
Though plot points, as they should
be, are hard to discern, the trailer
promises to shove viewers back
into the same jumble of brilliantly
developed characters dripping
with season one's comedic charis-
ma and magnetic pathos.
The show will again be present-
ed through the eyes of Piper Chap-
man, but the real protagonistcofthe
series has always been its entire
main cast: a living, breathing tes-
tament to the powers of ensemble
writing and acting. It's the reason
we spent hours - no, days - burn-
ing through season one last year,
and the reason we won't hold back
when Crazy Eyes returns in early
June. So brace yourself, prepare
yourself, get the screwdriver ready
- to venture back into the jungle.
-Akshay Seth
Pretty Little Liars
ABC Family - June 10 at 9p.m.
Every season I tell myself I am
not going to watch "Pretty Little
Liars" anymore. I quit. My ques-
tions are never answered and as
the years pass I only become more
and more confused. And yet, I can
100 percent guarantee that, come
June 10, I will be glued to my tele-
vision watching the season pre-
miere of "Pretty Little Liars." Even
though I end up frustrated every
time I watch, I have to watch. I
have to know who A is and I can't
give up on the show untilI find out.
I have to know if Ezra is alive and
if Ali is coming back to Rosewood.
"Pretty Little Liars" has mastered
the art of the cliffhanger, and it
has mastered the art ofscaring me
half to death every time I watch.
It is exhilarating. So even though
watching "Pretty Little Liars" is
a habit I should probably kick, I
refuse to stop watching. No shame.
P.S. Spencer is the best, no con-
test.
-Jordyn Kay
The Leftovers
HBO - June 15 at 10 p.m.
Any HBO drama premiere is
notable, because of the clout that
HBO has earned over the course
of the past decades (with such
dramas as "The Sopranos" and
"The Wire"). On June 15, HBO is
using the season finale of "Game
of Thrones" to launch a new
drama - "The Leftovers." Not
only is it a drama about what hap-
pens to Earth after a Rapture-like
event, but it comes from the mind
of Damon Lindelof. With "Lost"
and his work on films like the
"Star Trek" franchise, Lindelof
has established himself as one of
the most respected minds work-
ing in science fiction today. The
idea behind the show is the perfect
vehicle to explore themes similar to
those he touched on in "Lost," but
in a deeper manner. On HBO's end,
convincing Lindelof to make his big
return to TV on their network is a
huge coup, guaranteeing them one
of the most highly anticipated dra-
mas of the summer.
-Alexlntner
True Blood
HBO - June 22 at 9 p.m.

Sometime during season five,
between its religious allegory and

faerie nightclubs, "True Blood"
went off the rails (not that it hadn't
always been a crazy, crazy show).
But nonetheless, I've loved every
gory, messy minute of it. After its
reinvigorated sixth season - the
best 10 episodes the series had
delivered in years - "True Blood"
's upcoming season will bring an
end to the Sookie Stackhouse saga,
and hopefully bring "Blood" back
to its roots. Amid the madness of
werewolves, shifters, maenads,
witches ... the list goes on ... "True
Blood" 's core is the relationship
between vampires and humans.
Last year's finale set in motion a
final run that will bring the focus
back to where it started, while also
embracing and celebrating where
it's been. Is "True Blood" going to
be remembered as one of the great
series of this "golden age" of tele-
vision? Unlikely. But there are still
10 more episodes of supernatural
hijinks and campy fun toube had -
and "True Blood" is nothing if not
an outrageously enjoyable ride.
-Alec Stern
Masters of Sex
Showtime - July 13 at 10 p.m.
The first season of Showtime's
"Masters of Sex" was absolutely
fantastic - easily one of the best
new dramas in a year of incredibly
stiff competition (this pun was
accidental, I swear). "MoSproved
it was more than just a show about
sex and giant glass science dil-
dos - its standout quality is its
impressive heart. The relationship
between Michael Sheen's William
Masters and Lizzy Caplan's Vir-
ginia Johnson is the most electric
coworker relationship on televi-
sion since Don Draper and Peggy
Olson, but it was Allison Janney's
heart wrenching portrayal of a
sexually frustrated middle-aged
wife that really brought "MoS" to
the next level. Some subplots (Lib-
by's dance lessons, anybody?) fal-
tered, but the smart insights into
the complexities of human emo-
tional connection were enough to
make "MoS" master of my heart.
-Chloe Gilke
The Strain
FX - July (time/date TBA)
Once upon a time, vampires
were cool. They were scary. They
weren't tortured puppy dogs or
brooding love interests. They
were evil, vicious and menacing.
With "The Strain," filmmaker
Guillermo Del Toro ("Pan's Lab-
yrinth"), writer/producer Carl-
ton Cuse ("Bates Motel") and FX
aim to resurrect the myth of the
vampire the way it was always
meant to be told. Based on the
novel by Del Toro and writer
Chuck Hogan, "The Strain" fol-
lows Dr. Ephraim Goodweather
(Corey Stoll, "House of Cards")
and his team as they combat
an ancient strain of vampirism
in modern-day New York. The
series begins with a plane land-
ing at JFK with 200 bodies on
board and four survivors. Soon
enough the bodies start disap-
pearing from morgues and the
monsters of myth become the
nightmares of reality. Del Toro
will direct the first episode while
Cuse will serve as showrun-
ner, something he's proven to be
capable at from his time at "Lost"

and "Bates Motel."

The evolution of a leader

Michigan baseball:
Midseason awards

Fifth-year senior
Paras' leadership
helps lacrosse
become competitive
By MINH DOAN
Daily Sports Writer
The referee had just blown
the final whistle at Penn State
in the Michigan men's lacrosse
team's season opener, and
Thomas Paras looked around at
his teammates. Many of them
wore grim looks on their faces
after the eighth-ranked Nittany
Lions completely dominated
them, 22-7. Right then, the
fifth-year senior midfielder, as.
a captain, knew exactly what he
had to do. He called a players-
only meeting.
The Wolverines had come
into the season brimming with
confidence. Not only did the
first recruiting class have a
year under its belt, but the team
also felt it now had the talent
to compete, something it didn't
have the past two years.
"We had a lot of confidence
going into the Penn State game,"
Paras said. "But some days you
just don't have it, and that day we
didn't have our best game. I told
them that we had to minimize
the bad days we have because
we knew we didn't put our best
effort. But I also told them not
to be defeated and assured the
guys this season was not going
to go like the past two years."
But Paras has not always been
the outspoken leader he is today.
He used to be quite the opposite
earlier in his life. As he grew as
a leader, so did his influence on
the team.

Before the start of the
Michigan baseball team's Big
Ten season, the Daily predicted
which Wolverines would receive
end-of-the-year accolades. Now,
halfway through conference
play, it's time to reevaluate.
Offensive Player of the
Year: Jackson Glines
Regardless of how you mea-
sure a quality hitter, outfielder
Jackson Glines hasbeen the man
at Michigan. Since transferring
from Fresno City College last
fall, the junior has led Michigan
in batting average (.342), extra-
base hits (18), RBI (26) and qual-
ity at-bats. His killer instinct at
the plate has allowed him to hit
nearly everything he sees.
"Every week, he's consistently
having a very high percentage of
quality at-bats of his total plate
appearances," said Michigan
coach Erik Bakich. "He also
hits a lot of line drives - that's
why we've nicknamed him
'Gline Drives."'
In small-ball measurements,
Glines leads the Big Ten with a
.455 on-base percentage. Once
on base, Glines' 10 steals in as
many attempts give him the best
percentage in the Big Ten for any
player with double-digit attempts
and put him behind only sopho-
more infielder Travis Maezes for
the team lead. By bearing down
on the base paths too, Glines has
put himself in position to score a
team-leading 19.8 percent of the
time he's on base.
Glines has climbed his way
into the conference's top 10 in11
offensive categories, more than
any other Michigan player. The
versatility and ability to do it all
at the plate is what makes the
veteran the Wolverines' midsea-
son Offensive Player of the Year.
Defensive Player of the
Year: Cole Martin
Bakich puts defense on a
pedestal. No matter how many
runs the offense scores or
how many shutout innings the
pitching staff throws, the game
will be lost if the fielders can't
consistently make routine plays.
ButheleaderoftheWolverine
defense isn't the person with the
fewest errors or highlight-reel
catches - it's the one who sets
the long-term tone for the team
both emotionally and physically,
catcher Cole Martin.
The senior from Bay City,
Mich. is one of the most consis-
tent defenders on the team, car-
rying a .989 fielding percentage
and committingjust three errors
on the season. These numbers
have been important to see from
someone leading an infield com-
prised largely of underclassmen.
Many errors happen when a
catcher throws to second to nab
a runner breaking for a steal, but
with the aid of a pitching staff
that leads the Big Ten in pickoffs,
the opposition doesn't have many
chances to run on Michigan.
"He throws with a great and
very accurate arm, so you don't

Pitcher of the Year: Evan
Hill
On a team that has struggled
to find consistency, one thing is
certain: Sophomore left-hander
Evan Hill hasbeen ago-to player
who can pitch lights-out every
time he takes the mound.
At first glance, a 2-4 record
looks meager, but a deeper look
will showthe lack of run support
the ace hasbeen given. Michigan
has scored two or fewer runs in
five of Hill's 10 starts - putting
up a goose eggin three.
Hill has been the ace of this
squad. Since beginning the year
as the Saturday starter, he is now
the Friday starter - a position
given to the team's best pitcher.
Hill has held opponents to a
team-leading .259 batting aver-
age and threw the Wolverines'
only complete game of the year.
But his greatest impact has
come in the form of pickoffs.
Hill's seven pickoffs are tied for
the Big Ten lead.
"In general, holding runners
is something we place a lot of
importance on," said Michigan
pitching coach Sean Kenny
after Hill's start against Illinois.
"It's something we place a lot of
emphasis on. (Hill is) our best
guy atlit for sure."
If the first half of the season
is any indication, Michigan has
found itself an ace for this year
and the future.
Rookie ofthe Year: Carmen
Benedetti
A few games into the Big Ten
season, the standout rookie
appeared to be freshman right-
fielder Jackson Lamb, who made
two full-extension catches that
saved two leads. But Lamb's
inability to produce at the plate
has reduced his value, and the
new recipient of the award is des-
ignated hitter CarmenBeedetti.
Early in the season, Benedetti
had a few stellar performances,
including a .375 batting average
with two RBI in the Princeton
series. But his potential has
surfaced most against Big Ten
competition.
In conference play, Benedetti
leads the teamwith 12 RBI and is
second inbatting average at .326.
His biggest asset is his ability
to drive in runs on a consistent
basis, especially in high-
pressure, late-inning situations.
"Carmen has the knack for
hitting the ball hard at least a
couple of times a game," Bakich
said. "I think that's some-
thing he's probably done his
entire career."
Benedetti provided a stellar
performance in Champaign two
weeks ago, going 6-for-11 with
four RBI on the weekend. In
the Wolverines' 17-9 win over
Illinois, he doubled three times.
In the most recent series
against Purdue, Benedetti pro-
vided the bang thatbroke a 12th-
inning game tied atlsix, doubling
downthe right-field line to score
Glines for a 7-6 victory.
If his recent performance in
the conference is any indication,
Benedetti will end the year as
the team's top rookie.

After his senior year ended,
Paras had a choice to make. As
a fifth-year senior, Paras could
transfer to any program in the
country and play right away. With
his success on the field, he could
have had the luxury of leaving to
a more successful program.
But Paras' loyalty to Michigan
didn't waver. He knew exactly
where he wanted to be.
And as a leader, he always
knew he had a responsibility to
come back to the place where he
had put so much work in.
In that locker room at Penn
State, Paras commanded the
respect of the team with his
talk. After three years of leading
the team, he had finally found
his voice.
A week later, the Wolverines
bounced back from the loss with
a 20-7 win over Mercer. Paras
had only one goal, but everyone
felt his presence on the field.
And a week after that,
Michigan would beat in-state
rival Detroit in a 14-13
overtime thriller.
With his final season winding
down, Paras has been trying
to make Michigan's most
successful season even better.
Looking back at his time
at Michigan, Paras knew that

GOODBYE, MARygU
ILLUSTRATION BY ALICIA KOVALCHECK
For today, goodbye. For tomorrow,
good luck. And forever, 'Go Blue.'

After twelve years
at the helm, the 'U's
fourth longest serving
leader passes the torch
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily News Editor
For a brief moment last month,
Mary Sue Coleman couldn't find
her words.
After a year marked by lifetime
achievement awards, honorary
degrees and goodbye receptions,
it was a Monday afternoon in the
Michigan Union when Coleman's
voice noticeably wavered under
the weight of oncoming tears.
Coleman - who has been the
University's most influential
voice for the past 12 years - will
retire from the presidency in
July as the institution's fourth
longest-serving leader.
For months, Coleman's depar-
ture has been tangible, especially
within her inner circle. Col-
leagues in the Office of the Presi-
dent have noted each "last time"
since September.

In March, a group of students
decided to turn her fireside chat
- a tradition Coleman started
as president at the University of
Iowa - into a makeshift surprise
party.
Students, too, were thinking
about the end. At an event usu-
ally built around students having
the chance to ask their president
anything, many wanted to know
about legacy and what's next.
Laughing, Coleman's hands
sprung into motion, her small
frame inching to the edge of her
armchair. The questions didn't
faze her.
But before dozens of students
spent nearly 30 minutes past the
event's official conclusion wait-
ing to snap selfies with "Mary
Sue," the Midnight Blue student
a Capella group gathered in the
back of the Pendleton Room, set
up to serenade the outgoing pres-
ident with a song celebrating her
impact on students.
And then, for a second, the
almost always-composed Presi-
dent of the University of Michi-
gan struggled to find her words.
"That was the most I've seen
her choked up. And I think it

goes back to why students are
so important to her," said Kim
Clarke, Coleman's nine-year vet-
eran speechwriter. "When I've
seen her light up the most, it's
when talking about students.
That's where you see the energy."
Opening up
By the time four o'clock rolls
around on the day of a fireside
chat, it's the part of the afternoon
when energy runs low and the
rhythm grows sluggish. Clarke
said Coleman sometimes bristles
when it's time to walk past the
Cube and across Regents Plaza to
the Michigan Union.
But an hour later, in the com-
pany of a few dozen students,
"she's all amped up," Clarke said.
Perhaps Coleman's fireside
chats represent a larger philoso-
phy of the Coleman presidency
- one that many of Coleman's
closest advisers have said is root-
ed in inclusiveness and driven by
students.
"It's been the most wonder-
ful experience in my life and
it's largely because of students,"
Coleman said from her seat at the

March fireside chat. "The stu-
dents at Michigan are extraordi-
narily engaged in much of the life
of the institution and that makes
it a very exciting place to be. The
students have made allithe differ-
ence."
Erika Hrabec, the Office of the
President's chief administrator
and the president's key aide, said
she is frequently surprised by
how much Coleman remembers
about people, even those with
whom she's had seemingly lim-
ited interaction.
"She has a true interest in peo-
ple," Hrabec said. "Her style is
one of inclusiveness."
Hrabec, who serves as the
gatekeeper for commitments that
make it on to the presidential cal-
endar, said Coleman frequently
stops to hobnob with students
and staff, even if it means run-
ning a few minutes late to the
next meeting.
While habits like these may be
rooted in Coleman's passion for
people, she has also wielded her
interests not only to work donors,
open access to the school's
library resources in partnership
with Google and trumpet the

University's mission across the
country and the world, but also
to make far-reaching decisions.
"She really is interested in
what people think at all levels,"
Hrabec said. "She welcomes
input. She has a superb leader-
ship team and they are there for
a reason. She has to rely on other
people. She can't carry the Uni-
versity entirely."
Gary Krenz, special council
to the president, who frequently
staffed for Coleman at meetings
of the University's executive
officers, said from the beginning
she was intent on developing her
right-hand administrators to
function in ateam dynamic.
"There's a lot of exchange of
ideas - and she's in the fray," he
said. "Sometimes I think there
are leaders who build the team
and then they kind of step back
and listen. That's not her style
so much. She's engaged in the
discussion and providing her
own views. I think what's fas-
cinating is that all works very
well. She developed a team that
knew when she was expressing
her views in that kind of a set-
ting - that didn't mean that was

her decision or the final word - it
meant they were all in it together
trying to think this through out
loud."
But when it comes to tackling
a new issue orinitiative, Coleman
is not the president who tosses
around big ideas and leaves oth-
ers to figure out their imple-
mentation. While Hrabec said
Coleman provides leeway for
her staff to carry out the projects
they've been entrusted with, she
is not one to ignore the mechan-
ics of moving a task forward.
"She's a very goal-oriented
person and she's a get it done
kind of person," Krenz said.
"She conceives of things often in
terms of seeing the path of how
to get from here to there. Other
people I've worked for are more
conceptual - they have the idea
but they're not as specific on the
process. She has the processwith
the goal in mind."
If Coleman's student-friendly
persona and tendency toward
teambuilding are driven by open-
ness, her emphasis on the Uni-
versity's own accessibility may
have been formed with similar

Shapiro's reaction was to ment, and Duderstadt pointed to
embrace "smaller but better," prison as a possible culprit.

"We spend $2 billion a year
on locking people up right now,"
Duderstadt said. "More than
any other state in the Union, our
prisons are more expensive and
are locking up a higher fraction
of our population. So for what-
ever reason, a series of decisions
were made that prisons are
more important than education
in this state. Today even the Tea
Party people are beginning to
believe we walked ourselves out
on a limb on that one."
Coleman responded to the
financial hardship with a con-
coction of fundraising and
expansion, quite a contrast to
Shapiro's "smaller but better"
approach in the 1980s.
"Her attitude always was we
have to go forward in spite of
these constraints," McDonald
said. "That is where a presiden-
tial personality can make a dif-
ference. There could have been
a president who said, 'we better
stop building, we better drop
five schools,' or something dra-
matic like that."
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily, Coleman
said she understood the state
could not supply the resources
required for the University to
remain competitive with its
peer institutions.
"We had to do much more in
philanthropy - we had to be
much more like a private insti-
tution while still being proud
of our heritage of being a public
university and so we had to con-
fine those two better," Coleman
said.
Coleman's fundraising prow-
ess can be argued as a central
component of her legacy. She
piloted two fundraising cam-
paigns: First, the Michigan
Difference, which raised $3.2
billion between 2004 and 2008,
the most by any public univer-
sity campaign in American his-
tory; and second, Victors for
Michigan, which launched this
past year with a $4 billion goal.
"She's easily one of the small-

est of handfuls of effective
presidents in America with
campaigns," said Jerry May,
vice president of development.
"I mean lets face it, no public
universities have had campaigns
this big, and she's led our cam-
paigns and inspired donors."
Coleman also combated the
lack of state funding by increas-
ing enrollment and tuition.
Between Winter 2002 and
Fall 2013, the student body grew
from 36,377 to 43,710. To com-
pare, Duderstadt said there had
been serious thought to reduce
enrollment in select schools
during his presidency.
"The growth in the size of the
student population - with a sig-
nificant fraction of those com-
ing from out-of-state students
paying significantly higher fees
- really was the key to plugging
the whole that was left from the
withdrawal of state support,"
Duderstadt said.
The economic environment
could have had a really devas-
tating impact on the University,
but McDonald said Coleman
strengthened the University
over her tenure and set an opti-
mistic tone.
Context matters
McDonald said Americans
frequently make the mistake
of confusing the context with
the individual, and are tempted
by a 'Great Man' theory of his-
tory. While a president sets the
tone and can possibly damage
the institution, he warned that
there are much larger forces at
play than any one individual.
"Michigan is a notoriously
decentralized organization,"
McDonald said. "The president
doesn't hand down orders from
the Fleming building. There
are 19 schools and colleges run
by their faculty and led by their
deans and a lot of the good
things that happen on this cam-
pus happen on this great decen-
tralized level."

For instance, a juxtaposition
of the University's expenditures
under Duderstadt and Coleman
is insightful not only for the two
presidents' priorities, but more
so for what was necessary at the
specific junction. Duderstadt
focused mainly in the core aca-
demic units, renovating most of
LSA, while Coleman upgraded
more of the auxiliary units like

medical buildings, student resi-
dence halls and athletic facili-
ties.
Duderstadt compared it to the
catchphrase 'You play the hand
you're dealt.'
"This institution kind of
shapes the presidency and the
agenda of the president rather
than vice versa."

Diversity efforts stalled by affirmative action ban

Students from
CTE, BSU say
Coleman could
have done more
By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffReporter
University President Mary Sue
Coleman gave a special address
Nov. 8, 2006 on the Diag to a
crowd of more than 1,700 stu-
dents, staff and community mem-
hers.
One day earlier, Michigan's
voters outlawed the consideration
of race in college admissions in a
ballot measure that in many ways
stemmed from opposition to the
University's practices. Today, the
University remains embroiled in
the legal battle over the constitu-
tionalitofthatreferendum.

Coleman told the crowd that
diversity would remain a priority,
both for her and for the Univer-
sity, and she would do whatever it
took to maintain it.
"I am standing here today to
tell you that I will not allow our
university to go down the path
to mediocrity. That is not Michi-
gan," Coleman said in 2006.
"Diversity makes us strong, and
it is too critical to our mission,
too critical to our excellence, too
critical to our future simply to
abandon."
Affirmative action policies at
the University, along with diver-
sity and climate, are not a debate
Coleman started. When she came
to the University in 2003, the
University was already involved
in the issue through two Supreme
Court lawsuits filed against LSA
and the law school's race-con-
scious admissions policies under
the former University President

Lee Bollinger. In the former case,
Grutter v. Bollinger, the court
upheld the University's narrow
-use of race in admissions in the
interest of creating a diverse
class of students. The decision to
uphold the case is part of what
spurred the push to create and
implement Proposal 2.
But now, as she prepares to
depart 12 years later, with the
issue of affirmative action in
Michigan is again before the
Supreme Court, enrollment num-
bers for minorities at the Univer-
sity have fallen precipitously and
student protests about campus
climate are nearly a common
occurrence. Her efforts before,
during and after Proposal 2 have
become a part of what she'll leave
behind.
Beyond the numbers
Today. Black students make

up 4.8 percent of the under-
graduate population. Hispanic
students comprise 4.3 percent.
In the last two decades, Black
enrollment peaked at 8.9 per-
cent in 1996.
When looking at Coleman's
legacy on diversity, it's hard to
ignore those numbers. However,
Lester Monts, senior vice pro-
vost for academic affairs, said
in the context of the legal con-
straints imposed by Proposal
2 and other measures enacted
during her tenure, Coleman's
impact on diversity on campus
can more easily be understood
in her institutional support such
as infrastructure or advocacy.
"Her style is different from
President Bollinger's, her style
is different from President
Duderstadt's," Monts said. "But
diversity and multicultural-
ism is such a part of University
life that any president coming
in has to embrace it, and put
their own stamp on, and I think
that's what Mary Sue has done.
I think that's the infrastructure
improvements. I think that's
the expansion of diversity to
embrace the things that we're
doing globally."
Immediately after the pas-
sage of Proposal 2, Coleman
established the Diversity Blue-
prints Task Force, which was
charged with discovering ways
to increase and maintain diver-
sity on campus without affirma-
tive action.
More left to be done
Even when the conversa-
tion about diversity on campus
during Coleman's tenure is not
treated as a question of num-
bers, the impact of reduced per-
centages is hard to ignore.
Student groups focused on
diversity issues said they under-

stand the legal constraints the
University is operating under.
However, they claim the Uni-
versity and Coleman could have
done more to maintain diver-
sity and alleviate the effects of
homogeneity on campus.
LSA senior Erick Gavin, the
Black Student Union's public
relations chair, said in his expe-
rience, the administration and
Coleman have focused on the
bigger picture items, like Pro-
posal 2, and less on ameliorat-
ing day-to-day issues.
"That's sometimes where
we miscommunicate with each
other, the difference between
having wide-sweeping policy
changes and having life-style,
student affairs changes that
help students grow and learn,"
Gavin said.
Public Policy junior Daniel
Morales, a founding member of
the Coalition for Tuition Equal-
ity and former chair of Central
Student Government's Diver-
sity and Inclusion Commission,
said campus climate noticeably
deteriorated after Proposal 2
passed.
The Coalition for Tuition
Equality protested for the past
several years about the tuition
status given to undocumented
students.
"We could do more, and
President Coleman frankly
could have done more, when
Prop 2 passed, to reinvigorate
or kick it up a notch in terms
of engaging these communi-
ties," Morales said. "I know it's
really hard and I want to give
her credit, but we haven't kept
it diverse and we've declined
so much and we've become so
much less diverse."
Monts echoed Gavin's
thoughts on the importance of
bettering campus climate. "All
of these (initiatives) don't solve

all the problems," Monts said.
A voice for change
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily, Coleman said
when she spoke in the Diag
almost eightyears ago, her focus
was about affirming the Univer-
sity's commitment to diversity.
"I wanted our community to
understand that as a University
we very much value diversity
and would continue to find legal
ways to achieve diversity," Cole-
man said. "That's what we've
tried to do and I thought it was
a message that the community
really needed to hear."
Sometimes, what that com-
mitment to diversity has trans-
lated into is still a little murky.
Coleman's infrastructure
represents a long-term effort -
one that might not fully come
to fruition until long after she's
gone. The outcome of legal
action against Proposal 2 is
expected sooner, in June, but
there's no guarantee that it will
reverse its legal restraints. The
impact of movements like CTE
or #BBUM campaign isn't clear,
since both groups continue to
negotiate with administrators
about their respective issues.
But in the end, the simple fact
that she has been so open and so
vocal about her support is what
her legacy might be shaped by.
"Mary Sue Coleman saying
that diversity is something that
she wants, I think puts on other
administration's radar, faculty's
radar, and even student's radar
how important diversity is,"
Gavin said.
"Can I say specifically what I
think she's done to make chang-
es? I personally cannot," he
added. "I can say things that I
think she's pushed forward, that
have enacted a lot of change."

Coleman leaves legacy of empowerment

First female president
brought more women
to administrative
positions
By CLAIRE BRYAN
Daily StaffReporter
University President Mary
Sue Coleman was named the first
female presidentofthe Universityof
Michiganin2002.Atthetimewhen
she announced her retirement last
April, seven of her 12 executive offi-
cers were female as well.
While this combination brings
the University to the forefront
of changing gender demograph-
its in higher education, Coleman
does not define her presidency by
this milestone.
"I think these jobs are very
hard and I think they are equally
hard for men and women," Cole-
man said. "When I look at some
of my colleagues I don't think
there is a female way of being a
president and a male way. I think
there is much more commonality
and more differences individual
to individual then there is across

gender roles."
In a2008 speech to the Women
as Global Leaders conference at
Zayed University in Dubai, Cole-
man said there has been drastic
change over the last 40 years in
the influence of women leaders.
"I am proud to have been the
first womanto lead the University
of Iowa, and now the University of
Michigan; I believe my leadership
helps open the doors for women at
other universities," she said.
According to the American
Council on Education, in 1986,
only ten percent of university
presidents were female. Today,
that number has risen to 26 per-
cent.
LucieLapovskytheformerpres-
ident of Mercy College and the cur-
rent president of Higher Education
Resource Services, an organization
dedicated women's leadership, said
the number of women presidents
increases around one percentevery
two years.
"It is really hard to pinpoint
exactly what it is, but statistically
there is something wrong in the
system," Lapovsky said. "There is
no reason that there aren't 50 per-
cent women presidents. We have
more college degrees and equal

amount of doctorate degrees."
University Provost Martha
Pollack attributed the fewer num-
ber of women in top leadership
roles to a "pipeline effect."
"I think overall, historically,
there have been more men in aca-
demia than women and so then
of course there is a pipeline issue
as you move into administration
roles, you are drawing from the
faculty," Pollack said.
Coleman broke new ground in
2002 when she began her tenure
as the University's first female
president. Today though, her sta-
tus as a female leader is not par-
ticularlyunusual among other Big
Ten Universities.
Sally Mason succeeded Cole-
man as president of the Univer-
sity of Iowa, Lou Anna Simon is
the president of Michigan State
University, Rebecca Blank is the
chancellor of the University of
Wisconsin-Madison and Phyllis
Wise is the chancellor of the Uni-
versity of Illinois.
In the University's administra-
tion, Coleman created a strong
executive team not by looking for
gender, but by judging ability.
"I have had great men provosts
and Ihave had great women pro-

vosts," Coleman said. "I have had
men and women in all those posi-
tions. What you try to do is try to
pick the best person. You don't
look and say I have got to have
a woman for this position. You
never do that."
The trend of female empower-
ment is increasing in other fields
outside of academia, as well.
When recently appointed Gen-
eral Motors CEO Mary Barra was
selected as this year's springcom-
mencement speaker, Coleman
said Barra likely doesn't define
herself as General Motors' first
female leader.
"I know she probably down-
plays the symbolism of the role,
but I do think it's significant,"
Coleman said in a March inter-
view with The Michigan Daily.
Moreover, the landscape is
changing at the University. E.
Royster Harper, vice president
for student life, worked with four
male presidents before Coleman's
arrival.
"There has been something
easier, in some ways, about under-
standing complexity when I have
been working with women,"
Harper said. "I think it is because
they just get human development,

and the ways in which students
develop, in a fundamentally dif-
ferent way."
Harper said despite the grow-
ing number of women in leader-
ship roles, gender continues to
influence perceptions. .
"What your social identity is
plays a role in how you lead and
how people receive you as lead-
ing," Harper said.
In Coleman's 2008 speech in
Dubai, she acknowledged thatthe
decisions of female leaders are
often viewed through a gendered
lens, but is also rooted in the gen-
eral scrutiny received by men and
women assuming a presidency.
"Whether I am defending our
policiesortryingtohire anewfoot-
ball coach, Iam subject to the most
outrageous e-mails, letters and
commentary on radio talk shows,"
Coleman said. "I am 'stupid' ...
'ignorant' ... 'unable to appreciate
sports' because I am a woman ...
and profanities I won't repeat."
Cynthia Wilbanks, vice presi-
dent for government relations,
attributed the high number of
female officers to the types of
role models women have at the
University, as well as programs
through entities such as the Uni-

versity's Center for the Education
of Women.
"I see an enormous sensitivity
and outreach to develop leader-
ship for both men and women,"
Wilbanks said. "But I think there
have been very specific programs
developed to support women who
seek leadership roles."
Lisa Rudgers, vice president
for global initiatives and strategic
communications, credited col-
leagues such as Harper and Wil-
banks for paving the way.
"Ihaveneverfelttherewere any
barriers because I am a women
executive officer, but I credit that
in a large measure to those who
came before me and who shoul-
ders I stand upon," she said.
Coleman said is encouraged by
the fact that currently many more
provosts and deans are women,
providing increased opportuni-
ties to assume leadership roles.
"I think what has brought
opportunity for women is simply
being in the pool and being con-
sidered," Coleman said. "They
still have to be the best. No one
is going to give you a job just
because you are male or female,
these days. I think Schlissel will
view it the same way."

President left lasting impact on
leaders in higher education

During her tenure,
Coleman delivered
speeches at venues
around the country
ByKRISTEN FEDOR
Daily StaffReporter
When it comes to influenc-
ing higher education, University
President Mary Sue Coleman is
among the leaders and best.
In speeches at universities and
conferences across the nation,
Coleman has touted the Univer-
sity of Michigan's achievements
as well as addressed higher edu-
cation's most pressing challenges,
ranging from entrepreneurship to
student engagement and financial
aid.
Lou Anna Simon, president of
Michigan State University and
a close colleague of Coleman's,
praised Coleman's leadership
among educators in a statement
to The Michigan Daily.
"Mary Sue Coleman is the kind
of leader who can turn her vision
into action,not just for the Univer-
sity of Michigan, but for all of us
in higher education," she said. "I
know I'll be seeking her advice in
the years ahead."
It is this understanding of

higher education that earned
Coleman her role as chair of the
American Association of Univer-
sities, a nonprofit organization of
leading research universities from
the United States and Canada. She
was elected by the AAU to serve
a one-year term in October 2011
after previously serving as vice
chair.
AAU president Hunter Rawl-
ings said Coleman was selected
in part due to her reputation as a
strong supporter of federal fund-
ing for research.
Institutions gain membership
by invitation only, as determined
by an AAU committee. The Uni-
versity was one of the 14 found-
ing members of the AAU in 1900,
only three of which were public
institutions. At the time of Cole-
man's leadership, the association
boasted 59 members.
As chair, Coleman headed
the AAU executive committee,
serving as spokesperson for the
association. Additionally, she
represented the AAU at meet-
ings with national policymakers
focused on the role of research in
undergraduate, professional and
graduate education.
Rawlings said Coleman also
focused on issues related to her
support for affirmative action in
college admissions and increasing
college affordability.

Coleman's widespread influ-
ence on higher education also
garnered recognition from the
federal government and some of
the nation's highest officials.
In 2010, U.S. Secretary of Com-
merce Gary Locke appointed
Coleman co-chair of the National
Advisory Council on Innovation
and Entrepreneurship. Coleman
served on the council with fel-
low university administrators
and entrepreneurs. The council
advises President Obama on how
to foster entrepreneurial growth
and ways to stimulate the job
market.
Additionally, President Barack
Obama chose Coleman to help
lead the Advanced Manufacturing
Partnership, which launched in
2011. AMP focuses on investing in
technology that will result in the
creation of manufacturing jobs.
Coleman represented one of six
universities that worked alongside
industry executives and federal
government agencies in the part-
nership.
And in March 2014, Coleman
received the American Council
on Education's Lifetime Achieve-
ment Award in recognition of her
contributions to higher education.
Time magazine named Cole-
man one of the "The 10 Best Col-
lege Presidents" in2009, citingthe
record-breaking Michigan Dif-

ference campaign as one of Cole-
man's outstanding achievements.
Coleman has also received
numerous honorary degrees from
other institutions. Most recent-
ly, she was the commencement
speaker for the winter graduation
ceremonies at Indiana University
and Michigan State University,
where she promoted collaboration
between Big10 schools.
Though the campaign started
with a goal of raising $2.5 bil-
lion from 2000 to 2008, over the
course of the campaign from 2000
to 2008, it exceeded this expec-
tation with a total of $3.2 billion
raised.
In October, Coleman
announced the next fundraising
campaign, Victors for Michigan,
with a goal of $4 billion - the larg-
est public university campaign
goal in history.
When Coleman travels to
other institutions, she frequently
emphasizes the , importance of
fundraising at public universities
to offset pervasive declines in state
funding.
"It's not the most important les-
son - but it's one most of the public
institutions that I would compare
with Michigan are doing as well
because they understand they will
have to doit if they're goingto gar-
ner the resources they need," she
said.

University President Mary Sue Cleman applauds she selection of University
President-elect Mark Schlissel at his appuintment tn anuary 24 in the Michigan
Union.

leman, Michigan respond- The facility revamps did not

start with the positive-revenue
teams' facilities, either. Under
Coleman, the Athletic Depart-
ment unveiled a comprehensive
plan to revamp South Campus,
which will feature a new multi-
purpose indoor arena, a new
indoor track stadium and a "Walk
of Champions" connecting the
facilities on an east-west axis.
In honor of real estate mogul
Stephen M. Ross' $100 million
contribution to the Athletic
Department in September 2013,
the new South Campus has been
named the Stephen M. Ross Ath-
letic Campus.
"Mary Sue is one of the most
prolific fundraisers I've ever
seen," Brandon said. "But the
reasons for that aren't necessar-
ily visible to a lot of folks ... The
donors know she delivers on her
promises, is a good steward of
resources and cares very much
about quality and doing things
the rightway."
Even when the Athletic
Department- namely, the Mich-
igan football team and former
coach Rich Rodriguez - ran into
trouble with NCAA violations,
Coleman remained a levelhead-
ed, valuable resource to Martin,
and later to Brandon when he
took over in 2010.
"It was always a conversation
of'how can we provide more sup-
port for Rich,' "Martin said.
When the time came to part
ways with Rodriguez, Brandon
said Coleman could not have
handled the situation better.
"She's not a micromanager,"
Brandon said. "She's not a presi-
dent who wants to be a partner in
making decisions relative to ath-
letic programs.... She was a very
easy resource for me to access for

advice and input as I made deci-
sions."
As the Athletic Department
continues to innovate in terms of
generating revenue and creating
a sustainable model for future
operations, Coleman continues
to be supportive. The Univer-
sity hosted the Winter Classic in
January and will welcome Real
Madrid and Manchester United
to Michigan Stadium in August
in what's widely expected to
break the record for the highest-
attended soccer game in U.S. his-
tory.
"Every time I've gone to her
with those kinds of ideas, she's
been supportive and help-
ful and created excite-

"For some people,

faculty to stay
active, fit while
working on campus
By AMABEL KAROUB
Daily Staff Reporter
In 2005, University President
Mary Sue Coleman implemented
MHealthy, an iniatitve aimed
to promote healthy living in the
University community. Last year,
26,000 University employees par-
ticipated in MHealthy programs, a
testament to support the program's
success on campus.
Sitting on the board of Johnson
& Johnson, which has been rec-
ognized as a leader in employee
wellness efforts, Coleman drew
inspiration from the organization's
achievements.
MHealthy aims to reduce the
rising costs of health care for the
University. These healthcare costs
are increasing at a rate of 10 to 12
percent annually, an amount the
MHealthy Five-Year plan refers to
as "economically unsustainable."
UHS Director Robert Winfield, the
University's chief health officer,
said MHealthy looks to stop this
increase.
"Eventually, it would be almost
7 percent of our total University
budget," Winfield said. "Our goal
is to flatten that curve so that we
don't have these continual annual
increases."
To implement MHealthy, Cole-
man appointed ateam- The Mich-
igan Healthy Community Steering
Committee - to study what the
University needed in a wellness
initiative, and write up a plan.
LaVaughn Palma-Davis, senior
director of University Health &
Well-Being Services, said the team
formed a strategy by studying
national wellness leaders like John-
son & Johnson.
"We looked-at who were the
og lizations across the country
ivho were doing really well at this
and getting results," Palma-Davis
said. "We used that best practice
information as well as information
that was in the literature to identify
what were the key components that
we needed to put in place here to be
successful like they were."
In an October 2011 address,
Coleman praised those who had
participated in the MHealthy pro-
gram.
"So many individuals are now
pushing themselves and pushing
their colleagues to lead healthier
lives." Coleman said. "We're mov-
ing in the right direction, which
makes for healthier employees and
lower healthcare costs."
The committee put together the
MHealthy Five-Year Strategic Plan
that would last from 2009 to 2013.
Finally, they sent outa risk assess-
ment survey to better understand
the health risks University faculty
frequentlyface.
"It's an online questionnaire that
helps people to understand what

health risksotheyhave and how that
might impact their health going
forward, and encourages them to
work on them," Palma-Davis said.
Palma-Davissaidwiththeyearly
health costs as high as theyare, any
help MHealthy programs can pro-
vide will be extremely beneficial.
"It's around $360 million per
year that we spend on health insur-
ance costs for our faculty and staff,"
Palma Davis said. "Ifwe can impact
thateven one percent,it'sworth it."
MHealthy attempts to decrease
health risk levels to impact care
costs. The program defines health
risks as any conditions or behav-
iors that would harm one's health,
such as obesity, stress, unhealthy
eating, smoking or lack of exercise.
MHealthy classifies participants as
low, medium or high risk based on
their responses to an annual risk
assessmentsurvey.
Winfield said there is a correla-
tion between a patient's risk level
and their health expenses, along
with their ability to perform their
well in jobs.
"The health risks determine
absenteeism and health care
costs," Winfield said. "If you are
high risk, your health care costs
are going to be higher, and we
also know that you are going to be
absent from work more often."
The full results of MHealthy
will not be determined until later
this year, but Palma-Davis said it
is clear risk levels have decreased
since MHealthy began. More peo-
ple are in the low risk level column
than previously, and fewer people
are in the moderate and high-risk
level columns.
MHealthy adopted a variety
of programs to reduce risk fac-
tors among University employees.
Since MHealthy's launch in 2009,
employees have been offered free
wellness screenings. These screen-
ings test blood pressure, cholester-
ol, weight measurements, glucose
measurements and other factors.
Combined with the risk assessment
survey, these screenings allow
MHealthy to givuniquefeedback
to patients on what they need to be
doing to maintain or improve theit
health.
MHealthy Rewards gives
employees an incentive to follow
MHealthy's recommendations.
People are invited to choose what
health improvements they wish to
make, and if they follow through on
these improvements, they can get
$100 added to their paycheck at the
end of the year.
"That's just another added little
incentive to move some people,"
Palma-Davis said.
One of the most successful ini-
tiatives of MHealthy is Active U,
a 12-week challenge that invites
University faculty and staff to
keep track of their daily physical
activity. The program has a Maize
Track, which requires 30 minutes
of activity three days a week, and a
Blue Track, which is geared toward
beginners.
"We do see that people who par-
ticipate are increasing their days
and their minutes of physical activ-
ity," Palma-Davis said. "We have

gotten testimonials from people
saying how much it helps them
keep on track with their physical
activity."
Palma-Davis said MHealthy
aims not only to get individuals to
increasetheirhealth,but tocreate a
healthy University culture. Palma-
Davis said the support of colleagues
is one thing that helps people to
maintain fitness.
"My colleagues, they keep me
going," Palma-Davis said. "They
truly do help encourage each
other, and it's fun. It does impact
the culture."
In 2009, a few years after
MHealthy's inception, Winfield
asked Coleman to end smoking on
campus.
"It's the right thing to do, it's
good for our students, it's good for
our faculty and staff, you know
that it would reduce health care
costs," Winfield said. "She was
very supportive, and you now
know we have a smoke-free cam-
pus."
In addition to making positive
contributions in Ann Arbor, Cole-
man intended for MHealthy to
be a model wellness program for
other universities.
"She called for us to demon-
strate to the nation what can be
accomplished," Palma-Davis said.
"That then put the emphasis on
making sure we were doing what
was makinga difference."
And this goal may be achieved.
The University is a leader with-
in the Health Enhancement
Research Organization,a nation-
al wellness group that conducts
research and proposes health
objectives based on evidence col-
lected from partner organizations.
A growing number of institu-
tions are looking to implement
wellness programs similar to
MHealthy. Palma-Davis said
schools are looking to the Uni-
versity for advice on how to do
this.
In addition to an annual HERO
meeting, the University holds its
.awnhealth conference that brings
together over 30 universities. The
University invites schools includ-
ing The Ohio State University,
Iowa University, Emory Univer-
sity, Michigan State University,
University of Alabama, University
of Kentucky and Columbia Uni-
versity.
"It's actually an exciting time
because we're getting calls every
other week from other universi-
ties who have heard about what
we're doing and they want to
learn from us because they're get-
ting started," Palma Davis said.
"There's definitely a movement
among universities to implement
programs like this."
The University may be a model
for other schools, but Palma-Davis
said Coleman is the model for our
University, as she lives the lifestyle
she wants for our University.
"She's very active, and her hus-
band is too." Palma Davis said.
"She's been a great role model for
all of us."

these times of economic

hardships within the state and
federal governments, Cole-
man made consistent efforts
to lobby legislatures to keep
funding higher education,
Cynthia Wilbanks, vice presi-
dent for government relations,
said.
Coleman, along with other
Big Ten university presidents,
petitioned policymakers to
keep funding universities as
a priority on the premise that
college graduates will help fill
vacant jobs and improve the
economy in the long run.
"She made trips to Lansing
every single spring to talk
about the University, to talk
about the need for investment,
to make the case that case that
every sector of society needed

to do its part to make sure it
was spending wisely," Wil-
banks said.
. In 2011, for instance, Cole-
man wrote an open letter to
President Barack Obama urg-
ing not only the state and
federal governments to main-
tain their support for higher
education, but all sectors of
society, including business
leaders, philanthropists and
parents, to collaborate to keep
college affordable.
"As a former college profes-
sor, you know the rewards of
seeing students grow intellec-
tually, exercise critical think-
ing, and begin to shape their
communities," she said in the
letter. "This transformative
experience of higher learn-

ing contributes to the overall
wellbeing of our nation."
True to her word, Coleman
reached out to other areas in
search of funds for the Uni-
versity, including private
donors.
As the state economy began
to recover, state support for
the University has risen mod-
estly. This year, Republican
Gov. Rick Snyder increased
university funding by 6.1 per-
cent, the largest percentage
increase in over a decade. As
government funding increas-
es, Coleman's efforts to col-
laborate with private donors
will provide a solid founda-
tion for years to come.

1920. He died five years later of
heart difficulties.
Alexander Ruthven became
presidentin 1929 and was respon-
sible for leading the University
through the Great Depression
and World War II. Duderstadt
said Ruthven dealt with these
national issues by converting
the University into the more
corporate structure it maintains
today. Though his legacy of busi-
ness partnership continued, he
was forced to retire in 1951 after
developing dementia.
In choosing Ruthven's suc-
cessor, the University took from
its rival, Ohio State University,
and appointed Harlan Hatcher,
a former dean and English pro-
fessor. Hatcher's administration
nearly doubled enrollment, from
23,000 to 41,000, and oversaw
the development of North Cam-
pus, and the Flint and Dearborn
campuses.
Though Hatcher ushered in an
era of University progress, stu-
dent activists of the 1960s did not
appreciate his efforts. Hatcher's
term coincided with the found-
ing of Students for a Democratic
Society and the rise of popular
student protests. Duderstadt said
incidents like students photo-
graphing Hatcher's wife while
she was indecent occurred fre-
quently.
He retired in 1967 and did not
return to Ann Arbor for about 10
years.
"The students were mean to
him," Duderstadt said of Hatch-
er's final years in office.
The University again chose
a president from the Big Ten
community, appointing Robben
Fleming, chancellor of the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin, in 1968.
Fleming served for 10 years,
leaving the office to head the
Corporation for Public Broad-
casting.
Harold Shapiro became the
10th University president in
1980, guiding the University
through a time of national eco-
nomic difficulty. He began his
term just after the 1979 oil crisis,

inheriting a public university ina
state highly dependent on gaso-
line.
"The only option we had was
to get a little smaller and get
better at thesame time," Shap-
iro said. "Whether I achieved it'
or not, my focus was not on the
quantity of what we do but the
quality of what we do."
Shapiro chose to leave the
office in 1987, initially intending
to return to teaching in the Eco-
nomics Department; however, he
ended up taking an offer to serve
as president of Princeton Univer-
sity.
At Princeton, Shapiro tran-
sitioned from heading a large
administrative operation subject
to a variety of political actors
to a smaller institution with a
closer relationship to the aca-
demic sphere. He served until
2001 when he stepped down
and joined the Princeton faculty,
teaching economics and public
affairs.
"I've always told myself, when
I became president of the Uni-
versity of Michigan, that I would
never retire as a university presi-
dent, I would retire as a profes-
sor," Shapiro said.
Duderstadt took office after
Shapiro left for Princeton,
though at a relatively young age
of 46 compared to his prede-
cessors. Duderstadt worked to
increase diversity on campus and
grew and improved upon campus
infrastructure.
He left the presidency in 1996,
but unlike those before him,
Duderstadt stayed in Ann Arbor
to continue teaching. Though his
office is no longer in the Fleming
Administration Building, Duder-
stadt maintains close ties to the
University from his office in the
Duderstadt Library on North
Campus.
A second former Law School
dean assumed the presidency in
1996. Lee Bollinger developed
arts and sciences programs as
University president, as well as
faced legal challenges surround-
ing affirmative action in admis-
sions. He retired from office

in 2001 to take up the post at
Columbia University.
"I don't think (Bollinger) was
interested in being president at
Michigan for very long," Duder-
stadt said of Bollinger's tenure.
"It was a stepping stone."
Coleman took over after Bol-
linger's move to Columbia in
2002.
Duderstadt, Shapiro and Cole-
man have all spoken about the
transition from the presidency to
retirement.
According to Shapiro, the
move out of the President's
House - the oldest building on
campus - isn't much different
from moving out of any house.
However, moving out of Ann
Arbor was a different story.
"We called the movers and
they moved us out," Shapiro said.
"The hardest part was not only
leaving the University but leav-
ing town."
Shapiro still resides in New
Jersey, but said he makes it back
to Ann Arbor at least once a
semester.
In his book, Duderstadt
reflected on life after presidency
and the opportunities it can pro-
vide.
"Fortunately, we can con-
firm that there can indeed be
an active life after a university
presidency," Duderstadt wrote.
"Furthermore, it is possible to
have considerable impact built
on the experience and external
visibility gained during a presi-
dency."
Duderstadt said the transition
from presidency to retirement
was a major shift from public to
private life.
"At a public university, we
have a tendency to bury our his-
tory and pave over it," he said.
"That can be said of the presi-
dents as well."
He attributed the change
to the fact that he, like Shap-
iro, began his term at a young
age, allowing them to retire at a
relatively young and move on to
other projects.
"Harold left, I stayed," Duder-
stadt said.

Bothe Duderstadt and Sha-
piro. stepped down at younger
ages than Coleman. Duderstadt
retired at 54 and Shapiro retired
at 66.
Though former; presidents
leave the office, and possibly Ann
Arbor, they have continued to
be a resource for the University,
their predecessors and their suc-
cessors.
Coleman said she has benefit-
ed from the input of past presi-
dents whom she has been able to
be in contact with.
"I've had the pleasure of
working with Robben Fleming,
Harold Shapiro, Jim Duderstadt,
and Lee Bollinger," Coleman
wrote. "All have brought unique
experiences to the conversation.
And each of them has expressed
deep affection for Michigan and
its continued excellence."
Duderstadt said he has hosted
past presidents like Hatcher,
Fleming and Shapiro, who have
returned to Ann Arbor, attend-
ing football games and other
campus events.
In the capacity of being a
resource to those who have come
to the office after him, Duder-
stadt described the role of past
presidents as being, "unseen and
unheard, but available."
Shapiro echoed the sentiment,
saying past presidents should
be available for advice, but only
when called upon.
"Other than that past presi-
dents should just get on with
their life and get out of the way,"
Shapiro said.
Coleman said she does not
anticipate being in high demand
when University President-elect
Mark Schlissel occupies the
Fleming Administration Build-
ing next year.
"I will always be available, but
I also have complete faith in the
Board of Regents and its commit-
ment to hiring an outstanding
leader for the University," she
wrote before Schlissel's appoint-
ment in January. "Whoever is
selected will clearly possess the
qualities to be the 14th president
of this great University."

Under Coleman's leadership,
entrepreneurship flourished

Students reflect
on twelve years
of presidential
involvement

Campus community
learned to thrive in
innovation culture
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
In her tenure as University
President, Mary Sue Coleman
has championed entrepreneur-
ial spirit both on campus and off.
Coleman has stressed the
importance of innovation and
student entrepreneurship, espe-
cially in recent years, and her
efforts have seen great returns.
The University's knack for busi-
ness has put Ann Arbor on the
map as a hub of creativity and
innovation, now being com-
pared to other innovative areas
like Silicon Valley.
Under Coleman's leadership,
the College of Engineering pio-
neered the Center for Entrepre-
neurship, which was established
in 2008 to pool the University's
resources and experienced fac-
ulty to guide young entrepre-
neurs. Since its inception, the
CFE has launched a number
of entrepreneurship-focused
courses, in addition to co-man-
aging the TechArb student
startup incubator.
In a March speech in San
Diego, Coleman said entre-
preneurship empowers young
people to navigate the ever-
changing job market - a quality
the University hopes to provide
to its students.
"We have reimagined our
future," Coleman said. "Entre-
preneurship, disruptive innova-
tion, technology virtualization
and collaboration is making it
happen now."
In March, the University
implemented its newest pro-
gram, Innovate Blue, which
works with a host of University,
local and commercial partners
to power the proliferation of
student entrepreneurial spir-
it in the greater community.
Among these partners are the'
CFE, TechArb and Ann Arbor

SPARK.
Coleman also helped create a
University partnership with the
city of Ann Arbor called Ann
Arbor SPARK, a service that
"drives the development of inno-
vative technology startups." The
partnership has garnered $1.4
billion in new investments in
AnnArbor, and earned Coleman
the Institutional Leadership
Award from the International
Economic Development Council
March 27.
At the ceremony, IEDC
chairman Paul Krutko, CEO of
Ann Arbor SPARK, presented
Coleman with the award and
commended her efforts to pro-
mote development.
"Mary Sue Coleman is a
proven leader who is creating
economic opportunity in Mich-
igan," he said.
This sentiment is one that is
echoed by all of those who have
worked to widen the scope,
impact and application of stu-
dent entrepreneurship at the
University.
CFE Executive Director Tom
Frank said the combined pas-
sion for innovation displayedby
Coleman and Dean of Engineer-
ing Dave Munson compelled
him to move from his home in
Silicon Valley in the summer
of 2013 and accept the offer to
work in the CFE.
Frank identified the CFE's
three main objectives: estab-
lishing undergraduate entre-
preneurship programs, running
aggressive commercialization
trainingprogramslike M-TRAC
- which merges transportation
innovations created at the Uni-
versity into the auto industry-
and pushing community efforts
to sponsor student startups. He
said Coleman has been a strong
proponent of all of these goals.
"In my limited tenure, I can
tell you that I've had the privi-
lege of watching her speak on
a number of occasions and the
way that she evangelizes the
importanceof entrepreneur,
ship has been a true catalyst
for not only student organiza-

tions, but for the external stra-
tegic partners that I look for to
give our programs the rocket
fuel they need to get to the next
level," he said.
Engineering Prof. Thomas
Zurbuchen, Innovate Blue's
senior counselor for entrepre-
neurial education, said this type
of leadership was essential to
the founding of Innovate Blue,
which will tap into University,.
local and national resources to
unite entrepreneurship edu-
cation and practice in the real
world.
"It was clear that Engineer-
ing, Business and LSA started
supporting that," Zurbuchen
said. "So what she then did was
basically say, 'Okay, let's now
push the button and go do it.' So
she was a really critical part of
that campus life engagement of
entrepreneurship. I credit her
tremendously for that."
The University unveiled the
new program at South by South-
west, a 10-day festival in Austin,
Texas that promotes innovation,
music, technology and film. Its
development may have been
driven by the administration,
but Zurbuchen said a lot of time,
effort and ideas came from stu-
dent organizations aswell.
Innovate Blue is the first pro-
gram of its kind in that it has
paired with student organiza-
tions and outside partners to
drive the entrepreneurship cur-
riculum.
One of these groups is MPow-
ered, whose goal is to simply
"expose students to entrepre-
neurship."
Engineering senior Chris
O'Neil, the outgoing president of
MPowered, said the University
has been a key proponent of the
organization's success, foster-
ing entrepreneurial spirit but
staying hands-off enough to let
students independently build
"high-power, high-energy"
events on campus.
O'Neill said SpringFest was
an event that reflected students'
abilityto innovate- particularly
with the inclusion of the MPow-

ered-sponsored "MTank." Mod-
eled after ABC's "Shark Tank,"
the event allowed student entre-
preneurs to present their startup
ideas to a panel of local venture
capitalists.
O'Neil added that an event
like this is indicative of the
growth of student interest in
entrepreneurship at the Uni-
versity.
"Over the past seven years
or so, MPowered and the Cen-
ter for Entrepreneurship have
started to see alot more people
interested in entrepreneur-
ship, see a lot more people tak-
ing risks and trying something
new," he said. "Honestly, a lot
of them fail, but that's a part of
growth and the University is a
really good place to do that -
to fail and have the support of
your peers and the support of
the administration."
There is still a greater need
to bridge the gap between Uni-
versity students, the admin-
istration and the Ann Arbor
community, O'Neil said. How-
ever, with administrative bod-
ies like the CFE, groups like
MPowered and curricular pro-
grams like Innovate Blue, this
goal is in sight, but takes time.
Zurbuchen and Frank agreed
with this sentiment, adding
that entrepreneurship at a Uni-
versity level has the potential to
affect the greater environment
- as evidenced by Ann Arbor
SPARK or M-TRAC.
Zurbuchen said part of
effecting this change has to do
with interdisciplinary inter-
action, something that the
budding entrepreneurial com-
munity on campus, coupled
withthe efforts of Innovate Blue
and the CFE, strives to achieve.
Overall, he said, entrepreneur-
ship is a value life skill for all
students to acquire.
"If I ask any employer today,
'What are you looking for in a
future employee?' what they
will say is, 'Leadership and an
open mindset.' So the ability to
see what can be done, but turn
these ideas.

University's top
leader held fireside
chats, meetings with
an array of students
By EMILIE PLESSET
Daily StaffReporter
University President Mary
Sue Coleman has become a
campus celebrity.' Through-
out the 12 years of her presi-
dency, she fostered personal
relationships with students
through monthly fireside chats
and annual open houses at the
President's House to students
in the fall.
"She is very approachable
and very kind," said Business
senior Michael Proppe, former
Central Student Government
president. "You can really just
tell the intelligence and poise
that she exudes. She has gone
such a long way in making the
University a great school."
Throughout her time at the
helm, Coleman maintained a
tradition of opening her house
to students in the fall. In Sep-
tember, hundreds of students
lined South University to tour
her house and take pictures
with her.
"She takes a lot of time to
engage with students," Proppe
said. "I think she is overall one
of the most accessible univer-
sity presidents in the country.
Her commitment to taking the
time to individually speak with
students is definitely some-
thing that could be commend-
ed."
Coleman has also held peri-
odic "fireside chats" to allow
students the opportunity to ask
her questions and discuss their
experiences at the University in

a comfortable setting. Coleman
brought the practice of fireside
chats from her time as Presi-
dent of the University of Iowa.
She and E. Royster Harper, vice
president for student life, sit
down with a handful of students
once a month, a rare chance for
students to get direct access to
administrators.
Kinesiology sophomore
Kelsey Thome attended one of
Coleman's fireside chats last
year and said she appreciated
that Coleman took the time to
visit the freshmen living on
North Campus.
"It was very intimate and
very personal," Thome said.
"It was really like just sitting
down and talking with her. I
thought it would be more for-
mal, but it wasn't, which I real-
ly liked."
Proppe said during his time
working with Coleman she was
open to student input and took
student ideas into consideration.
When the Athletic Department
made the decision to switch to
general admission seating, Cole-
man readily listened to student
concern and advocated the stu-
dent voice.
"She's definitely a very help-
ful person,"- Proppe said. "She
cares a lot about the student
experience and is willing to
fight for students when she sees
an issue."
Coleman's campus presence
and dedication to the students
has earned her the love of the
University community.
"Everyone loves Mary Sue,"
said LSA sophomore Paige
Devries. "She really tried to get
involved with the students. I
think that's something people
will miss. I just associate Mary
Sue with the University. She's a
presenie on canipus when she
doesn't have to be."


COLEMAN

values in mind.
Coleman, who was born in Kentucky
and came of age in a South separated by
segregation, began to understand the
corrosive nature not only of division,
but exclusion, when she moved to Iowa
for junior high school.
In an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily, she said it was the Univer-
sity's decision to fight for affirmative
action before the U.S. Supreme Court,
that partly led her to leave the Univer-
sity of Iowa presidency for Michigan.
But despite the promise of expanded
access, Coleman found herself on the
Diag in 2006 after the passage of Pro-
posal 2, the Michigan ballot proposal
that banned the use of race in admis-
sions, proclaiming the University's
commitment to diversity.
For Coleman, these decisions are
rooted not only in a belief in the value
of a diverse student body, but also in
a drive for connection and accessibil-
ity.
"The other part is my strong feel-
ing that we have to partner with other
people - that you can't go it alone and
that universities have to open up to the
outside community and bring other
thoughts and advice in," she said in an
interview with the Daily.
However triumphant the Univer-
sity's win inside the marbled halls of
the Supreme Court, the aftermath of
Proposal 2 may also be etched as one of
Coleman's greatest frustrations - and
failings - of her presidency.
Black undergraduate enrollment has
fallen to just over 4 percent since the
Michigan voters banned the use of affir-
mative action in admissions.
"I think you can never be satisfied
and certainly I'm not," she said. "It's one
of the things I'm disappointed about -

that we weren't able to achieve as much
as I'd hoped we would butI know people
are committed and I know we'll keep
trying."
But despite the extent to which Cole-
man has worked to open her administra-
tion and the University she leads, there
have been times the Fleming Adminis-
tration Building has kept information
and processes closed off from the pub-
lit, the media and members of the Uni-
versity community.
In January, after the Daily reported
former kicker Brendan Gibbons had
been permanently separated from the
University, raising questions about the
University's promptness in investigat-
ing allegations and sparking criticism of
the University's transparency, Coleman
remained largely silent on the issue, cit-
ing privacy protections, apart from a
written statement.
"Athletics has no influence over sex-
ual misconduct investigations or the
academic standing of student athletes,"
she wrote.
This incident is not the first that
sparked controversy during her final
year of her presidency.
In the fall, a number of University fac-
ulty criticized Coleman and her admin-
istration for failing to be transparent
and inclusive in the University's deci-
sion to centralize 250 department-level
employees in a shared services center -
a component of the larger Administra-
tive Services Transformation.
Sustainingthe future
In a 24/7 joblike a university presiden-
cy, institutional challenges frequently
weigh hard on their leaders. If anything
keeps Coleman up at night, it's the task of
funding amulti-billion dollar operation-
an entity that has seen plummeting state
support during her tenure.
In interviews with multiple members
of Coleman's personal staff, preservation
of the University's fiscal health was listed

as one of her top accomplishments.
"I always, in the back of my mind, am
worried about resources, and making
sure that the University of Michigan has
enough in the way of resources because
what we do is costly," Coleman said. "We
give a personalized education here
that I think is the very best education
for young people, but we have to have
the resources to do it."
This worry, too, is partly entrenched
in the same frustrations expressed due
to underrepresented minority enroll-
ment: the struggle to open the Uni-
versity's doors during a time when it's
becoming fiscally more challenging to
do so.
"I'm also worried about families
not feeling that they can send a son
or daughter to Michigan because of
resources so we really have to have
more financial aid and that's at the top
of my list," Coleman said.
When Coleman addressed the grad-
uates of Eastern Kentucky University
in 2012, she appealed to the legacy of
her grandfather, Albert Wilson, who
left his Kentucky farm to go to college,
paving the way for Coleman's father
and eventually herself. In many ways,
Coleman sees access to higher edu-
cation not only as the key to a better
life for succeeding generations, but as
the bedrock of her own journey to the
presidency.
"A college education - the diploma
you have worked so hard to earn - has
a catalytic effect of geometric propor-
tions," she said.
In November, Coleman launched
the $4 billion Victors for Michigan
campaign, the University's largest
fundraising effort to date, complete
with a $1 billion goal earmarked for
student support.
The campaign, which will continue
well into the presidency of University
President-elect Mark Schlissel, is just
one marker of the ongoing challenges
that remain unconcluded at the end of

a presidency.
"She's kind of a caretaker - we're all
caretakers," Hrabec said. "This insti-
tution is so old it's going to go on long
after we're gone - so for a moment in
time, we're caretakers."
Though Krenz deferred to define
Coleman's legacy, he said her longev-
ity is significant, noting that the aver-
age university president serves 4.5
years, compared to Coleman's 12.
"The longer presidencies in this uni-
versity's history have been the most
impactful presidencies and that's not
just because of the amount of time,"
he said. "It's because of the stability
that comes with that kind of extended
leadership. You need fresh blood, but
universities are very dynamic places
and to have the protective umbrella of
a constant presidency is very helpful
to an institution."
Legacy
After 12 years, Coleman has left her
mark on the University - on the campus
landscape, on its coffers and on its com-
munity.
But for a president so widely loved and
well known, Coleman - who loves bicy-
cling, Joni Mitchell and her cats Jerry
and Betty - has. often kept the personal,
personal.
While the joys of the presidency are
often visible, moments of sadness and
anger are harder to see.
When a University medical transplant
helicopter crashed in 2007, killing the
entire team on board, Coleman said it
was one of the most wrenching moments
of her presidency. She attended all six
funerals.
"You can't predict those sorts of
things, but you have to be ready when
tragedies happen that you can bring the
community together," she said.
Legacies, like personas, are also hard
to pinpoint. Characterizing a 12-year
term as open or closed, triumphant or not

enough is a task many of Coleman and
her colleagues deferred.
"Legacies are best defined by others,"
she said in an interview with the Daily
and again at the fireside chat, with the
Pendleton Room's portraits of the past
staring down at her.
Embracingtheunknown
In 1961, Mary Sue Wilson, then a high
school senior in Iowa, came home to
eat lunch with her dad. She arrived to a
Western Union telegram, announcing
she was a finalist in the Westinghouse
Science Talent Search.
The daughter of a chemistry profes-
sor and a third-grade teacher, Coleman
had been participating in science fairs
since junior high. Now, she was the first
Iowa student selected as a Westinghouse
finalist. Wearing a pillbox cap and white
gloves, Mary Sue traveled to Washington
and met President John F. Kennedy in the
White House.
Fifty years later, she delivered the key-
note address to the 2012 crop of what are
now called Intel finalists. Those students
had just met President Barack Obama,
whose signed holiday card sits on a shelf
in Coleman's office.
"If you had told me then that I would
become president of one of the world's
leading research universities, I would
have laughed out loud," she said to the
finalists. "The only thing I was sure of
at age 18 was that I loved chemistry and
maybe, just maybe, I would become a col-
lege professor."
Coleman, a biochemist by training,
went on to proclaim the beauty in science
and unpack the doors opened by discov-
ery and risk-taking.
"That leads me to my first piece of
advice for you... I encourage you to
embrace the unknown."
For Mary Sue Coleman, reaching for
uncertainty, in the pursuit of possibility,
inclusiveness and openness, is more than
okay. It's beautiful.
