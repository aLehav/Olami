Reinventing 
Urban 

Transportation and Mobility 
aims to revolutionize public 
transit through an online app 
that turns transportation into 
an on-demand service. The 
app, which serves travelers on 
the University of Michigan’s 
North Campus, first launched 
this month on January 16. 
While no timeline is set in 
place yet, the developers hope 
to 
eventually 
expand 
the 

service to the University as a 
whole.

RITMO, 
partnering 

with the Ford School of 
Public 
Policy, 
will 
allow 

students, faculty and staff 
to use on-demand shuttle 
transportation linked with 
the University bus system. 
Riders only need to book one 
ticket to their destination and 
wait up to five minutes for 
their shuttle to arrive.

Pascal 
Van 
Hentenryck, 

the Seth Bonder Collegiate 
professor at the College of 
Engineering, is leading the 
RITMO project. He explained 
how the new system hopes to 
resolve inefficiencies within 
our current transportation 
system by solving the so-called 
first and last mile problem, 
when individuals have to walk 
more than a “comfortable 
distance,” typically 1/4 miles. 

Second-year 
Law 
student 

Megan Brown has spent the past 
seven years at the University, 
first 
for 
her 
undergraduate 

education and now for Law 
School.

Now, she has been selected as 

the editor in chief of the Michigan 
Law Review – a University of 
Michigan publication written by 
legal scholars, practitioners and 
students. She also discovered 
she would be the first Black 
person to hold this position at 
the Law Review, which issued 
its first publication in 1902.

She initially held the position 

of an associate editor of the Law 
Review, which she achieved 
after 
a 
rigorous 
process 

involving 
writing 
a 
paper, 

various 
publication-related 

exercises and interviews.

Brown said she felt honored to 

be chosen as editor in chief and 
attributed her success to those 
around her.

“Any 
success 
that 
I’ve 

achieved in Law School is really 
a credit to my classmates and my 
professors,” Brown said. “And 
then once some of these people 
gave me a little more confidence, 
it just felt good to work hard and 
make them happy and proud and 
make myself proud.”

Regarding her role as the first 

Black editor in chief, Brown said 
she had no knowledge of it when 
she applied. The Law Review 
board told her after she had 

been selected. Brown said her 
selection reflects the progress 
the Law School community has 
made.

“I will admit that it did take 

a while,” Brown said. “It should 
have happened sooner. But I like 
to think of this as mostly good 
news. There’s a lot of crazy stuff 
happening on campus and in the 
world racism-wise, and it feels 
good to know that at least my 
community has faith (in me).”

Brown said her classmate 

Johannah Walker, a third-year 
Law student, is someone who has 
encouraged her to be her best. 
Brown met Walker through the 
Black Law Students Association, 
of which they are both members. 
Walker said seeing Brown go 
through the early stages of the 
process and then achieving her 
goals was amazing.

“Megan is what everyone 

says 
she 
is,” 
Walker 
said. 

“She’s intelligent, she’s driven, 
she’s kind and thoughtful and 
generous, but even more than 
that she just works so incredibly 
hard. I think that’s just been 
reflected through everything 
I’ve always seen her do.”

Walker said having Brown 

specifically be the first Black 
editor in chief is significant.

Two days after Michigan 

State University president Lou 
Anna Simon resigned from her 
post, the university’s Athletic 
Director Mark Hollis followed 
suit, according to a statement 
released 
on 
the 
University 

website Friday afternoon.

The resignations come in 

the wake of the sentencing of 
Larry Nassar, the once-world-
renowned physician for the 
USA Gymnastics team and the 
MSU athletic department who, 
over the course of at least three 
decades, 
molested 
hundreds 

of women and girls whose 
treatment he was responsible for. 

A Detroit News investigation 

published January 18 revealed 
multiple employees in MSU’s 
athletic department were told 
of Nassar’s abuse in the decades 
leading up to his firing in 2016. 
Simon herself was informed 
of a police report and Title 
IX complaint against Nassar 
in 2014, but said they were 
reported to her as being against 
an “unnamed physician.”

After 
discovering 
she 
had 

three herniated disks at age 27, 
University of Michigan 2008 alum 
Helaine Knapp was determined 
to find an effective, low-impact 
workout. Her doctor suggested 
rowing, but she said she initially 
associated 
rowing 
with 
the 

untouched machine at the gym 
or in her grandfather’s basement. 
Knapp decided to challenge this 
stigma.

Now, following the success of 

its first two studios in Manhattan, 
CITYROW – a rowing fitness 
boutique founded by Knapp – will 
open its third location in Ann 
Arbor at 401 E. Liberty this spring.

“I was really frustrated and 

kind of kept going back to the 
rowing thing like, ‘Is there any 
way to make this sexy and cool and 
chic and available for everyone?’” 
Knapp said. “And so that was sort 
of the impetus behind CITYROW, 
because I knew there had to be a 
better and smarter way to work 
out.”

Knapp 
and 
John 
Rotche, 

another 
University 
alum, 

partnered together to franchise

After success at New

the business and create its newest 
location. Referred to Rotche by 
a mutual friend, Knapp said her 
uneasiness toward franchising 
was immediately relieved after a 
phone conversation with Rotche.

“I didn’t know anything about 

franchising — I just thought of 
McDonald’s or Subway,” Knapp 
said. “I talked to John Rotche, 

and by the end of the phone call 
I was hooked, because the way 
he talked about franchising was 
this luxury, rich experience and 
taking care of people who are 
investing in your brand.”

After decades of experience 

in franchising, Rotche founded 
Franworth, 
a 
franchise 

development company based in 
downtown Ann Arbor. Franworth 
partners with emerging brands, 
such as TITLE Boxing Club 
and Sweetwaters Coffee & Tea, 

to combine their franchising 
expertise 
with 
the 
brands’ 

knowledge of their products.

“Helaine knows how to run 

a boutique, high-end, trendy, 
cutting-edge, 
cool, 
vibrant 

boutique fitness out of New York,” 
Rotche said. “But does she know 
how to expand it globally in the 
franchise space? She doesn’t have 
that experience, nor do I have the 
experience of running a rowing 
boutique.”

After consulting with trainers 

and former rowers, Knapp 
and 
her 
team 
members 

developed a high-intensity 
interval workout for rowing 
and strength training.

“There’s a microphone, 

there’s kick-ass music, and 
they’re going to lead you back 
and forth on the machine and 
the mat, doing a combination 
of workouts,” Knapp said. 
“We also teach everybody 
how to row in every single 
class.”

Though Rotche said he 

was not expecting much to 
come from his first phone call 
with Knapp, he was instantly 
hooked by her ideas and 
conviction.

“What she was able to do 

is she took the old rowing 
concept and (it) was reborn in 
a very cool and trendy way,” 
Rotche said. “I fell in love 
with the branding. I loved the 
simplicity — I love that it’s so 
focused on one thing.”

Prior to her injury, Knapp 

had no interest in rowing. 
While fitness experts have 
known the immense benefits 
of rowing for quite some 

time, rowing is just beginning 
to gain mainstream popularity. 
LSA sophomore Lilia Duncan 
had never rowed before arriving 
to college, but last year she tried 
out and walked on the women’s 
rowing team.

“I think that rowing provides 

a training plan like no other,” 
Duncan said. “I think that if 
you’re really looking to get your 
whole body in shape and your 
whole body toned up, it’s a great 
workout.” 

Though busy with the rowing 

team herself, Duncan said she 
knows many of her peers are 
always searching for trendy, 
effective ways to work out.

“I know people are constantly 

looking for new ways for fitness 
like SoulCycle, like so many 
people are into that,” Duncan 
said. “I guess it’s cool because 
going to the gym over and 
over again kind of gets boring, 
and having a little twist to try 
something where it could actually 
be applicable to going in a boat 
and actually doing it – I think 
that’s a cool experience.”

During 
her 
undergraduate 

career, Knapp struggled to find 
a fun place to work out and 
de-stress with friends. After 
moving 
to 
New 
York 
after 

graduation, Knapp “fell in love 
with boutique fitness,” and said 
she hopes to bring this joy to the 
Ann Arbor community.

“I’m very excited because I 

would have loved this on campus,” 
Knapp said. “I would have loved a 
place that could be a community 
of like-minded people that were 
doing something that’s good for 
our bodies — and our minds.”

MIDNIGHT BOOK CLUB

Tablecloths 
covering 
the 

cafeteria-style 
tables 
and 
a 

roaring fire projected on the wall 
was what greeted diners at North 
Quad Residence Hall Thursday 
evening. While some may have 
confused the dining hall for a 
luxe restaurant, the event was 
really a surprise from Michigan 
Dining, which planned a “pop-
up dinner” for the night and 
treated students to table-service 
and a gourmet meal.

According to a tweet from 

MDining, the event was the 
largest surprise pop-up dinner in 

its history. The surprise was part 
of a series for MDining, but in the 
past, MDining served only about 
20 randomly-selected diners for 
each pop-up dinner. This time, 
575 guests were served.

Elliott 
Rains, 
marketing 

coordinator 
for 
Michigan 

Dining, said MDining had never 
tried the concept on such a large 
stage.

“This was our first attempt at 

‘popping up’ for an entire dining 
hall!” he wrote in an email. “The 
goal of our pop-ups is to give our 
students a unique and enjoyable 

experience. In our smaller pop-
ups, it gives our students and 
chefs an opportunity to meet and 
talk with one another. We also 
love that it lets our chefs think 
outside the box and get creative 
with their menus.”

Guests were treated to a 

three-course meal, with entrees 
including New York strip with 
glace viande, herbed salmon 
topped with wild-caught shrimp 
and 
a 
vegetable 
napoleon. 

Diners finished their meals with 
decadent tiramisus topped with 
coffee creme anglaise, chocolate 

ganache and fresh raspberries.

LSA 
sophomore 
Kenneth 

O’Donnell attended the event 
and was shocked when he 
walked into North Quad on 
Thursday evening.

“I had no idea — it was very 

surprising,” O’Donnell said. “It 
was really cool though, it was 
like a good surprise. It was really 
fancy.”

The North Quad team made 

the pop-up dinner possible with 
help from team members from 
other dining halls, including 
Executive Chef Frank Turchan.

ON THE DAILY: THREE MICHELIN STARS FOR NORTH QUAD


The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
Michigan in Color & News
Monday, January 29, 2018 — 3A

When I joined Michigan 

in Color over one year ago, I 
wrote about my excitement to 
contribute to a space that allows 
people 
from 
marginalized 

communities to finally have a 
voice at an institution like The 
Michigan Daily. To me, this 
was and is necessary because 
I 
recognize 
the 
immense 

power that stories can have. 
And only by showcasing these 
stories can we move forward 
in bridging the divides on 
our campus. However, what I 
didn’t expect from this space 
was the personal growth I’ve 

had over the past 12 months.

My time with MiC has 

introduced me to a host of 
people, 
communities 
and 

organizations I wasn’t familiar 
with before joining the section. 
I’ve gotten to interview student 
leaders and faculty members, 
and had the opportunity to 
cover speakers and events on 
campus. When West Quad 
Residence Hall was hit with 
racist vandalizations early last 
semester, we were able to serve 
as a platform for the students 
who were personally attacked. 
Experiences like those have 
opened my eyes to the reality 
of racism on our campus and 
have reaffirmed my desire to 

fight these inequities.

Though MiC has changed 

a lot since our founding over 
four years ago — and Ashley 
and I have big plans for this 
upcoming year — we strive 
to reflect MiC’s core values 
of inclusivity and bravery in 
the work we do every day. 
I’m forever grateful for the 
guidance from the editors who 
came before me (our founders, 
Toni and Demario, and anyone 
I’ve forgotten), the ones I’ve 
worked with over the past year 
(Tanya, Sivanthy, Halimat and 
Adam), and the new group of 
assistant and senior editors 
we’ve 
assembled 
for 
this 

upcoming year.

Wow, how time flies. It seems 

like just yesterday I was a first-
year entering The Daily for my 
first mass meeting. I didn’t start 
as an Michigan in Color writer; in 
fact, when I first heard of MiC, I 
wasn’t sure I was even included 
in the category Person of Color. 
However, following a series of 
accidents, I found myself at the 
MiC desk, I’ve never looked back. 
As a member of the MiC team, I’ve 
had the privilege to bear witness 
to the impact power sharing 
narratives has on an individual 
and a community. From writers 
who say MiC was the first time 

they felt their story was validated, 
to community members listening 
and 
learning, 
I 
know 
the 

importance of this section. Stories 
matter. Representation matters.

As I enter my final year with 

MiC, I feel a sense of bittersweet 
accomplishment. I’ve seen MiC 
evolve from a radical column to 
an established section and the 
growing pains that come with 
it. In the same way, I’ve seen the 
way I’ve grown. Before MiC, I 
was confused about my purpose 
on this campus. Every other 
organization and community I 
tried to join just didn’t feel like 
home. With MiC, I found my 
voice was heard and my actions 
were recieved. I wouldn’t be the 

person I am today without the 
opportunities I’ve had here.

I want to thank the mentors 

and community I found while at 
MiC. To the amazing women of 
color founders whom I never met, 
your courage is an inspiration 
— look at everything that has 
happened because of you. To Toni 
and Demario, you two will forever 
remain my social justice icons; I 
continue to aspire to the passion 
and care you two showcased 
in every interaction. Last, but 
not least, to Sivanthy, Adam, 
Christian, Halimat, Jason, Tanya, 
Areeba and Neel: thank you so 
much for the love and support 
over the past year. Long nights 
were easy because of you all.

Why I joined MiC: Jason Rowland
Why I joined MiC: Ashley Tjhung

At Michigan in Color, we 

have the privilege to share many 
important narratives of students 
of color on campus. One of my 
favorite parts of my job is working 
with these individuals — listening 
to their unique voices. But one of 
my other favorite parts of working 
at MiC is listening to the wild 
banter among me and my fellow 
editors about all things pop 
culture.

Some topics include:
1. Critiques about the MET gala 

and celebrity fashion choices

2. Live Grammy commentary
3. Our embarrassing pasts on 

Tumblr

4. The social justice 

implications of Harry Styles’ 

“Sign of the Times”

Yeah, some conversations are 

obviously not at all serious, but 
they’ve been fun and important 
nonetheless. And a lot of the 
time, these conversations have 
prompted me to think more about 
my position as a person of color 
navigating through pop culture 
that is constantly evolving in our 
digital age.

Off the Record comes from 

former MiC managing editors 
DeMario Longmire and Toni 
Wang. They’re honestly some of 
the funniest people I’ve ever met, 
while at the same time some of the 
smartest people in a room. 

CHRISTIAN PANEDA

Senior MiC Editor

“I noticed the bus running 

mostly empty along the edge 
of campus, and I thought, 
‘Wow, can we actually do an 
on-demand multimodal transit 
system here?’” he said. “That’s 
where the RITMO project 
started.”

The 
RITMO 
team 
has 

collected data on bus ridership 
on campus, which they will 
use to decide where to run 
buses and where to deploy 
on-demand shuttles that will 
pick up commuters and bring 
them to a bus route or their 
destination directly.

Jonathan Levine, a professor 

of Urban and Regional Planning 
at the Taubman College of 
Architecture 
and 
Urban 

Planning, has lead a team 
collecting data by surveying 
the use of transportation by 
students, faculty and staff.

“(We ask questions about) 

how you would travel under 
new scenarios,” Levine said. 
“What route would people 
take? We build models based 
on the data that comes out of 
hypothetical 
questions 
we 

ask.”

One of the team’s greatest 

technical 
challenges 
comes 

in the form of using cloud 
computing 
and 
artificial 

intelligence 
to 
optimize 

routes and ride-sharing in the 
shuttles.

“What 
we 
are 
doing 

behind the scene is analytics: 
Designing 
the 
system 
and 

predicting what people are 
going to do,” Van Hentenryck 
said. “We want to dispatch 
the vehicles as quickly as 
 

possible and maximize ride-
sharing.”

Taubman graduate student 

Jacob Yan works with Levine 
on his team. He described 
the social responsibility that 
comes 
with 
designing 
an 

innovative 
transportation 

system.

“We have been talking about 

the travel agencies: how they 
might re-define the system, 
and how the aggregate demand 
for the system will look, how 
this will impact low-income 
populations,” Yan said.

Ultimately, one important 

goal for the RITMO project is 
to work with communities to 
revolutionize 
transportation 

by 
making 
it 
accessible, 

efficient and cost effective. 
While 
we 
have 
seen 
the 

transformation of taxi systems 
with 
applications 
such 
as 
 

Uber and Lyft, public transit 
has 
yet 
to 
become 
more 

dynamic, according to Van 
Hentenryck.

“We are trying to improve 

accessibility,” Van Hentenryck 
said. “In the U.S, the best 
predictor 
of 
poor 
social 

mobility is whether you have a 
car or not. If you make people 
walk even a quarter of a mile, 

you lose 50 percent of your 
ridership. People don’t want to 
walk very far to be picked up, 
you have to be picked up very 
close to your location.”

The RITMO project has 

strong ambitions for the future. 
They 
hope 
to 
incorporate 

autonomous 
vehicles 
to 

create a more cost-effective 
University transit system, as 
well as use electric vehicles.

“At some point, we also 

want to have all of these 
vehicles electrified to reduce 
greenhouse gas emission,” he 
said. “(Using shuttles could 
be a) way to integrate electric 
vehicles.”

RITMO 
will 
continue 

expanding on North Campus 
this year, focusing especially 
on serving graduate students 
who live within two miles 
of campus. Down the road, 
services 
like 
RITMO 
may 

be scaled to larger cities, 
increasing 
efficiency 
and 

access for all commuters.

When I was younger, being Black 

and Nigerian never caused me any 
problems. I grew up in a fairly 
diverse town and school district. 
Throughout elementary school, I 
had friends of multiple races and 
ethnicities. Though it was obvious 
to us, even as elementary schoolers, 
that we differed by skin color, it 
never changed how we saw each 
other. The only thing I didn’t like 
about myself that stemmed from 
my race and ethnicity was my hair. 
I was always ashamed of my hair 
and how it was naturally kinky and 
coily, unlike my friends’ hair. This 
probably stemmed from the media 
to which I was exposed, and how 
all the girls my age on TV, in movies 
and in magazines were white with 
hair extremely different from 
mine. Other than that, being Black 
and Nigerian wasn’t much of a 
problem for me.

My ethnicity started to play a 

bigger role in my life in middle 

school. Before that, I never gave 
a second thought to the fact I was 
Nigerian. I was Black and I was 
Nigerian. And that was it, until 
middle school. Then, being Black 
started to have connotations. Being 
Black meant you were loud, rude, 
unruly, didn’t care much about 
your education and only spent 
your time with other Black people. 
I did not align with any of these 
characteristics; none of my friends 
happened to be Black. Another 
thing that set me apart was that 
I wasn’t just “African-American 
Black,” I was African Black, which 
meant I had a different culture, 
background and experience than 
an 
African-American 
person. 

But unless I constantly reminded 
people that even though our skin 
looked the same, we were very 
different because of my Nigerian 
heritage, then I was seen as a Black 
kid who didn’t “act Black” or fall in 
line with the rest of the Black kids.

The whole of my middle school 

experience 
could 
have 
been 

described as an elephant-in-the-
room situation. Everyone was 

aware I was Black, but didn’t “act 
Black.” It was never brought up, it 
was just an ever-present fact and I 
just tried to carry on with my life 
with this in the background. The 
only time during middle school it 
was brought up was in my eighth-
grade history class. In one class, we 
were all split into groups of four, 
and a student in my group found 
it important to bring up that “all 
of us in the group happened to be 
Black, except for one of us that was 
an Oreo…” Even though he didn’t 
explicitly say he was referring to 
me, it was still apparent he was 
talking about me. At the time I 
just sat there quietly, even though 
if that happened now I definitely 
would have a few choice words to 
say.

As rude as the comment was, 

in the moment it didn’t really 
affect me much. But in the long 
run, it definitely took a toll. For 
high school, I went to a school in 
a different district, which meant 
starting over socially. I already 
knew that 90 percent of the 
students in the new district were 
white. Through my logic, coming 
into this district with no friends as 
a Black kid, I could probably expect 
jokes and comments based off of 
my race. To combat this, I came 
up with some coping mechanisms. 
The first one was to make jokes at 
the expense of my own race before 
other people could. For example, 
I started calling myself an Oreo, 
so that when other kids did, it 
wouldn’t be offensive because I 
did it first. I also tried to forget 
my racial and ethnic identities as 
much as possible. I never brought 
up my Nigerian heritage or culture 
and I never mentioned my race. 
Whenever it was brought up, I 

wouldn’t say anything so people 
would forget I was Black or 
Nigerian.

Being 
Nigerian 
also 
added 

an extra challenge for me in 
high school. Even though the 
majority of the kids in my class 
were white, there was a number 
of 
first-generation 
immigrant 

kids with whom I bonded. I made 
friends with people whose parents 
immigrated from Germany, Syria, 
Poland and more. But even with 
those friendships, I still felt like 
I was an outsider. All of my first-
generation 
immigrant 
friends 

were so much more in tune with 
their families’ cultures than me. 
I started to feel as if I wasn’t truly 
Nigerian. I couldn’t explain my 
culture to people as well as they 
could. I couldn’t speak either of 
the languages my parents spoke. I 
also had the added issue of my race. 
Most of my other first-generation 
friends passed as white, so people 
didn’t know they weren’t just 
“white” until they told them of their 
background. When people saw 
me, they saw me as Black, which 
made me even more uncomfortable 
discussing my Nigerian culture.

High 
school 
was 
hard 

for me in terms of accepting 
my 
race 
and 
ethnicity. 
 

But as I made more friends and 
became more comfortable with 
my peers, I started to make some 
strides in my self-acceptance. At our 
yearly culture fair, kids would set up 
booths representing their culture 
or another country’s culture. Even 
though it was something most 
people looked forward to, it was 
something I slightly dreaded. 

said he was “not running away 
from anything.”

“This was not an easy 

decision for my family, and 
you should not jump to any 
conclusions 
based 
on 
our 

decision – listen to facts,” 
he 
said. 
“Much 
attention 

has recently been given to 
outside investigations into the 
University and the Athletic 
Department, including those 
both by the Michigan Attorney 
General and the NCAA. Let me 
be clear, that in retirement, I 
will fully cooperate with these 
and any other investigations.”

Furthermore, 
an 
ESPN 

investigation 
published 

Thursday 
showed 

administrators did not report 
the 2014 complaints to federal 
officials, despite the fact that 
officials were on campus that 
year 
investigating 
MSU’s 

handling 
of 
sexual 
assault 

accusations.

In 
response 
to 
her 

resignation letter, Simon was 
widely criticized for what many 
interpreted as defiance and a 
refusal to accept responsibility 
for enabling and failing to stop 
Nassar’s abuse and the culture 
that led to it, asserting “there is 
no cover-up.” 

“As tragedies are politicized, 

blame is inevitable,” Simon 
wrote. “As president, it is only 
natural that I am the focus of 
this anger.”

A 
second 
ESPN 

investigation, released Friday, 
reveal a culture of sexual abuse 
and domestic violence within 
MSU’s athletic department to 
a degree not previously known. 

Lauren Allswede, who worked 
at MSU as a sexual assault 
counselor until she quit in 2015, 
told ESPN sexual assault and 
domestic violence complaints 
involving athletes or coaching 
staff were handled mainly by 
the athletic department itself. 

“It all got kind of swept away 

and it was handled more by 
administration [and] athletic 
department officials,” Allswede 
said. “It was all happening 
behind closed doors. ... None of 
it was transparent or included 
people who would normally be 
involved in certain decisions.”

The investigation implicates 

MSU football head coach Mark 
Dantonio and basketball head 
coach Tom Izzo, two of the 
university’s most prominent 
figures, in the mishandling of 
investigations. According to the 
investigation, an undergraduate 
student-assistant coach for the 
basketball team was allowed 
to continue coaching after 
being criminally charged for 
punching a female student in 
the face in 2010. 

Allswede said in response to 

her voiced concerns regarding 
the 
athletic 
department’s 

handling 
of 
sexual 
assault 

complaints, 
MSU’s 
general 

counsel’s office sent an attorney 
to reassure her. What she was 
told, though, only concerned 
her further: addressing a sexual 
assault accusation against one 
of his players, Allswede said 
the attorney told her Dantonio 
responded only by having the 
player talk about the accusation 
with his mother. 

Dantonio called the story –– 

as well as any other accusations 
of his mishandling of reports 
of sexual assault against his 
players –– “completely false”.

G

rowing up, I was one of 
those weird kids from 
a weird family. In an 

attempt to shelter 
my siblings and 
me, my parents 
refused to have 
internet or cable 
television in the 
house. For a time, 
we had a hunky 
desktop 
plugged 

into the ethernet 
cable where we 
could 
spend 
20 

minutes 
a 
day 

playing games on Miniclip 
or Disney.com. But when our 
time ran up, we had nothing 
to connect us to the outside 
world. As a homeschooled kid 
in the backwoods of the Upper 
Peninsula, I really didn’t have 
the option of hanging out with 
the local kids, especially since 
the nearest neighbor under 
the age of 60 was about five 
miles away. So that had me 
turning to my own world: my 
world of books.

Without the distractions of 

the rest of the world, I spent 
every free moment engrossed 
in “Robinson Crusoe”, “The 
History of The World” and 
even 
Isaac 
Asimov’s 
“The 

Intelligent Man’s Guide to 
Science”, 
along 
with 
any 

other book I could get my 
hands on. I would read in the 
hayloft in order to hide from 
my siblings. I would read by 
flashlight when everyone else 
was sleeping. I would even 
lock myself in the bathroom 
in order to finish another 
chapter. I was addicted to 
reading and it was the best 
thing that could have ever 
happened to me.

As I got older, I continued 

my reading frenzy, and when 
I joined the public-school 
system in high school, I was 
the class nerd. Not in a bad 
way either — it was easy to 
integrate 
when 
everyone 

wanted to sit next to you, 
even if it was for all the wrong 
reasons. I was top of the class 

and it was all thanks to the 
vast amounts of reading I had 
done. My books had taught 

me everything from 
astronomy to world 
history 
to 
global 

economics.

I 
continued 
to 

read throughout high 
school, 
striving 
to 

finish two or three 
books every month. 
It 
helped 
me 
to 

improve my writing 
as well and taught 
me to read critically. 

I felt much more comfortable 
writing academic papers and 
my college application essays. 
I can say I wouldn’t be at such 
a prestigious university if it 
weren’t for the skills I had 
gained while locked away in 
the bathroom.

It was a habit I let go when I 

first began my college career, 
because of my busy schedule 
and all the excitement that goes 
along with being a freshman in 
college. As a result, I suffered 
the worst grades I had ever 

earned. Ever. As a kid who 
was grounded more than once 
for bringing back a progress 
report that proclaimed an A-, I 
was appalled at myself (to this 
day, my own mother hasn’t a 
clue, heaven have mercy).

When 
my 
second 
year 

rolled around, I told myself I 
would pick up reading again, 

in an attempt to distance 
myself from the distractions 
of 
technology 
and 
social 

media. The results? I received 
exponentially better grades, a 
feeling of better self-esteem 
and, surprisingly, more time 
on my hands. I was amazed at 
what a difference it made for 
me and rather disappointed 
in myself for having lost 
that. I hadn’t realized what a 
profound impact such a simple 
habit had on my life.

According 
to 
a 
study 

conducted 
at 
Stanford 

University, “reading is the 
workout the brain needs in 
order to stay in its optimal 
health.” It serves to improve 
vocabulary, 
analytical 
and 

communicative skills, as well 
as 
enhance 
your 
memory 

and 
ability 
to 
focus 
and 

concentrate. It can even help 
to reduce stress and, according 
to 
Anne 
E. 
Cunningham’s 

paper “What Reading Does for 
the Mind” it serves to keep you 
sharp as you age. If you don’t 
believe me, listen to Lisa Bu’s 
TED Talk, “How Books Can 
Open Your Mind.”

In today’s world, books are 

more accessible than they 
have ever been before. More 
accessible 
than 
they 
have 

been throughout history. With 
e-books, public libraries and 
school campuses, it is nearly 
impossible to find yourself 
without access to a book. 
There is even a “take-a-book-
leave-a-book” library next to 
Washtenaw Dairy, and many 
others like it all over the 
country. You don’t even need a 
library card! So what are you 
waiting for? Join the likes of 
self-proclaimed avid readers 
Steve Jobs and Phil Knight 
(among a multitude of others), 
get down to your local library 
and set those brain cells to the 
grindstone — the results might 
just surprise you.

I 

grew up in a household 
that I always considered 
to be absolutely middle 

class. Food was always on 
the table, but the idea of 
buying a Canada Goose jacket 
or going to college out of 
state 
was 
never 
seriously 

entertained. And this was 
fine, because where I grew 
up, in a small rural town in 
Northern Michigan, no one 
could afford anything from 
the Canada Goose brand, and 
almost everyone was working 
hard during the summer to 
afford a community college 
education. So I never really 
felt like I was poor until I 
came to Ann Arbor.

To be clear, I wouldn’t 

consider myself poor. I am 
perhaps on the lower end of 
the socioeconomic scale for 
a student at the University 
of Michigan, but I have been 
given a lot of privileges that 
many of my peers haven’t 
been 
afforded. 
My 
dad’s 

life insurance coupled with 
my 
family’s 
money-saving 

savviness 
and 
a 
helpful 

scholarship 
has 
ensured 

that I will graduate from the 
University debt-free. I live 
with the knowledge that if 
my dad hadn’t passed away, 
I might not have been able 
to afford to go here, which 
is 
something 
bizarre 
and 

somewhat 
disturbing 
that 

I’ve had to cope with. But 
during my time in Ann Arbor, 
I’ve never gone hungry and 
I’ve never worried about not 
having enough money to pay 
my rent — circumstances 
which I’m sure many of my 
peers have unfortunately faced.

Still, I think I speak for 

many lower-income students 
when I say the University of 
Michigan sometimes doesn’t 
feel like a real place. When 
I was in high school, it was 
common for me to hear that 
a friend didn’t have enough 
money for gas, or that they 
couldn’t afford the school 
lunches. Here, it’s common 
for me to hear peers complain 

about 
how 
their 
parents 

are upset at them for eating 
out too often at expensive 
restaurants. I’m not here to 
pass judgment — if my family 
made enough money, you bet 
I would eat lunch every day at 
Tomukun and complain about 
my mom getting on my case 
about it. I’m just saying that 
when you hear your peers 
complaining 
about 
things 

that aren’t an option for you, 
you begin to feel like you live 
in a city where real-world 
issues don’t really exist.

So 
when 
I 
found 
out 

Central Student Government 
had 
created 
a 
“Campus 

Affordability 
Guide” 
and 

that 
many 
students 
were 

complaining that this guide 
was out of touch, I was 
really not surprised. And 
honestly, at this point, I 
don’t have the energy to be 
angry 
about 
these 
things 

anymore. I’m graduating in 
a few months knowing that 
taking an unpaid gap year 
or traveling the world isn’t 
really an option, or that even 
grad school isn’t a possible 
opportunity until I find a job. 
I’m tired, scared and ready to 
get out of this expensive city.

So what I’m really trying 

to say is I’ve accepted that 
the University has a pretty 
upscale campus, ranked as 
having one of the wealthiest 
student bodies of any public 
university 
in 
the 
United 

States, and I realize it will 

take major social upheaval 
and institutional change in 
order to change this fact. All 
I ask is that the wealthier 
members of the student body 
recognize 
this, 
and 
stop 

assuming that everyone is 
of the same socioeconomic 
background. I’m asking that 
students stop being surprised 
when they find out some of 
their peers are unable to 
join 
student 
organizations 

because 
of 
their 
work 

schedule, or not everyone has 
the connections necessary to 
get a job or internship at a 
major institution. I’m asking 
that we recognize that the 
University is an incredibly 
privileged campus and that 
the lives many of us live are 
unimaginable to a decent 
portion of the country.

 I, along with many other 

students, am tired of having 
to explain why we can’t live up 
to the expectations of those 
among us who have never 
had to worry about money. 
We’re tired of explaining 
why we can’t just give up 
things we’ve never been able 
to afford in order to save 
on cash. We’re tired of our 
explanations as to why our 
lives are inherently different 
from our wealthier peers 
being met with condescension 
and the general feeling that 
our thoughts are unwelcome. 
And once a major portion of 
our campus realizes they are 
in fact a lot wealthier than 
those classified as having a 
low 
socioeconomic 
status, 

then we won’t have to explain 
ourselves anymore. And at 
that point, we can actually 
start 
addressing 
the 
real 

issues and barriers poorer 
students face. Because to 
be clear, wealthy students 
aren’t the problem, but a 
lack of understanding and 
representation is.

W

alking into the Diag 
on 
an 
unusually 

warm 
and 
sunny 

Saturday morning, I melted into 
a crowd filled with 
hundreds of women, 
men and children all 
attending this year’s 
women’s 
march. 

Signs 
filled 
the 

crowd with mantras 
like “it’s not criminal 
to be an individual” 
and “the power of 
the people is stronger 
than the people in 
power.” There were 
women dressed in costumes 
from 
Margaret 
Atwood’s 

infamous book and the new 
show 
“The 
Handmaid’s 

Tale” with their red bonnets 
striking against the blue sky. 
Standing with these fellow 
protesters in solidarity was a 
powerful force. Each person 
came from a different walk of 
life, with different views on 
justice. But all were united in 
forceful solidarity.

It is easy to feel powerless 

in today’s world. I often find 
myself turning off the news, 
overwhelmed and ashamed of 
the government we have today. 
As I hastily close out of my 
news browser, it is easy to want 
to complain with degradation, 
to ask how we, our country, 
its citizens — even the world 
— got to this point. Yes, to 
retreat is easy, especially 
when you see no place for 
strength and redemption.

I did not attend a women’s 

march last year. Though I am 
passionate 
about 
speaking 

out against the continuous 
existence 
of 
workplace 

harassment 
and 
sexual 

assault, I never fully understood 
the power of a march. Like 
many 
others, 
I 
read 
the 

newspaper and consider myself a 

politically-conscious 
individual, able to 
defend my beliefs 
and 
support 
my 

reasoning. However, 
immersion 
within 

the 
Ann 
Arbor 

Women’s 
March 

showed 
me 
the 

power and change 
that participating in 
a tangible movement 
brings.

Every individual marches 

for his or her own reasons. 
But 
recognizing 
why 
you 

may, or may not, march is 
what 
demonstrates 
where 

your true beliefs lay. Political 
activism is not a straight path. 
Each individual brings his or 
her beliefs, convictions and 
capabilities to a movement. 
One may grow into political 
activism, or jump into it 
headfirst. Recognizing what 
issue you truly care about and 
committing to fight for it is 
how an individual turns into 
an activist.

To quote Nobel Laureate 

Elie Wiesel, “Do not stand idly 
by if you witness injustice. 
You must intervene. You must 
interfere.” Choosing to stay 
quiet — whatever issue, side 
or cause it may be — only 
lets the status quo persist. 
The only way to make change 
from where we are today is to 
get up, find your calling and 
take action.

One considerable way to 

ensure you do not remain 
quiet is to remember the 
activists of the past and the 

present 
who 
found 
their 

passions. Susan B. Anthony 
never lost sight of winning 
women the right to vote, 
and endless figures, from all 
different social movements, 
followed her visions. Discover 
what you want to change and 
never lose sight of this goal.

Attending 
Ann 
Arbor’s 

Women’s March empowered 
me to commit to the change 
I want to see in our nation. 
But it is important not to let 
this motivation slip as social 
problems continue to arise. 
In a New York Times article, 
march 
participant 
Nadya 

Agrawal explained that she 
hopes the people marching 
across the nation today will 
not forget about the Deferred 
Action for Childhood Arrivals 
or Black Lives Matter protests 
that occur subsequently.

But I want to challenge 

myself, my peers, friends 
and mentors to take a stand. 
The passage of every moment 
lends itself to history. It is up 
to us, whether it be on this 
campus, in your hometown or 
in the government. Activism 
is what this country and its 
citizens need.

I challenge you not to take 

the easy route. We can all 
be activists. But you must 
set your mind to the cause 
that empowers you to make 
change. March. Call your 
senator. 
Volunteer. 
Keep 

marching, until you are part 
of the change that you wanted 
to see happen.

In 
“Lebanon,” 
Israeli 
director 
Samuel 
Maoz 
experimented 
with 
confinement, restricting the 
entire film to activity within 
a single tank. “Foxtrot,” his 
latest film, which played last 
September 
at 
the Venice Film 
Festival and won 
its Grand Jury 
Prize, explores 
a different kind 
of confinement. 
A 
tragedy 
in 
three 
acts, 
“Foxtrot” is a master class 
in extracting tender feelings 
from audiences, then stomping 
on the last remaining hope 
one might have. It’s absolutely 
devastating.
It would be cruel to be 
clued any plot details, so I’ll 
try to be as vague as possible. 
“Foxtrot,” 
whose 
three 
acts each feature a single 
mistake and the ripples that 
emanate from it, begins with 
sad news: When two Israeli 
soldiers knock on the door 
of Michael (Lior Ashkenazi, 
“Norman: The Moderate Rise 
and Tragic Fall of a New York 
Fixer”) and Daphna Feldmann 
(Sarah Adler, “Tsili”), Daphna 
collapses in shock, before even 
hearing that her son, Jonathan 
(Yonatan Shiray, “A Tale of 
Love 
and 
Darkness”) 
has 
been killed in the line of duty. 
Michael, too, becomes nearly 
catatonic; he’s unresponsive 
and lashes out at the family dog 
when it comes to comfort him. 
He’s just broken inside. And 
we, thanks to Maoz’s excellent 
camerawork, are right there 
with him. Repeatedly filmed in 
a tight close-up, it’s impossible 
to avoid Michael’s anguish 
and, as uncomfortable as those 
moments are, it’s an intrepid 
effort in empathy that strikes 

one 
as 
almost 
impossibly 
hopeful. At the same time, 
a number of birds-eye shots 
reveal his confinement and his 
entrapment, forced to confront 
his grief with no forewarning.
In 
the 
second 
act, 
we 
witness Jonathan in action, 
and it’s a mixture of unbridled 
joy and harrowing fear. The 
first mention of the film’s title 
comes when a fellow soldier 
explains 
that 
the 
foxtrot 
is 
actually a dance 
and, in a musical 
interlude, 
dances 
with 
explosive 
energy, in stark 
contrast to when 
the soldiers must actually do 
their job, which is to monitor a 
supply route, checking to make 
sure 
everyone 
who 
passes 
through will not pose a danger 
to them or to the country. How 
often are we lucky enough to 
experience such a cavalcade 
of raw emotion, and wildly 
variant emotions at that? That 
we may move from grooving 

in our seats, to laughing at 
passing 
camels, 
to 
white 
knuckling as a car is slowly 
and methodically examined in 

the dead of night is a testament 
to Maoz’s careful and humane 
direction.
The 
last 
act 
returns 

to 
Michael 
and 
Daphna, 
confronting their grief. Though 
they 
remain 
more 
distant 
than before, their melancholic 
reunion 
is 
both 
quietly 
heartbreaking and somewhat 
uplifting. Maoz’s screenplay’s 
slight vagueness is resolved 
at the film’s conclusion, in 
a devastating shot, but the 
preceding half hour or so can 
be obfuscated by lingering 
questions left unresolved. It’s 
a shame, because after the 
film’s middle third, which is 
some of the most staggeringly 
intoxicating filmmaking I’ve 
ever seen, the film doesn’t 
quite match itself. 
In an interview with Film 
Comment, Maoz described the 
film as an emotional journey: 
first act as shock, the second 
as hypnotization and the third 
as being moving. It’s no stretch 
that Maoz has found success 
in his latest film. As allegedly 
controversial as it may be in its 
home country, “Foxtrot” is a 
film that undoubtedly shocks, 
hypnotizes and moves us. It’s 
definitely worth seeking out.

TORONTO INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL

I know, I know. I know what 
it sounds like.
Let me start off by saying 
that no, I’ve never straight-up 
copied somebody else’s work 
and tried to pass it off as my 
own. I’ve never, for instance, 
meticulously 
unearthed 
some obscure passage from 
Joyce Carol Oates 
or Katherine Anne 
Porter and turned 
it in for a fiction 
workshop and been 
like, I hope it’s good, 
it’s only a first draft! 
(Which I’m realizing 
now probably sounds 
like 
a 
weirdly 
specific example. I 
haven’t. I promise.)
But let’s take the 
fact that most of us aren’t 
conniving schemers and set 
that aside for a moment, shall 
we? Barring the fact that we 
all rock, I think there’s a little 
more here to explore. And I 
think that when we say we’re 
only here for original ideas, 
there’s a hidden truth there 
that we’re not really telling.
Maybe it would help if I strip 
away the word “plagiarism.” 
It’s 
understandably 
kind 
of a buzzword. There are a 
million other words I could 
use that would make it easier 
to get behind this argument: 
“Riffing.” 
“Reworking.” 
“Reimagining.” Even words as 
harmlessly vanilla as inspire 
and influence have their place 
on this list.
My dad is a composer, 
and a couple of days ago, 
I went to a concert where 
one of his pieces was being 
performed by the Orion String 
Quartet. The piece was a 
string quartet, “Astral.” The 
second movement was called 
“Starry Night,” inspired by 
Van Gogh’s painting of the 
same name; the fourth was 
called “Wintu Dream Song,” 
and was based off of a Native 
American funeral song text 
from the Wintu tribe of the 
west coast. This is something 
I’ve noticed my dad, and some 
other composers, doing a lot 
in their work: setting their 
music against ideas borrowed 
from poetry, stories and other 
forms of art. One of the other 
pieces performed that night, 
Brett Dean’s String Quartet 
No. 2 (“And once I played 

Ophelia”) did the same thing 
with 
scattered 
lines 
from 
“Hamlet.”
That 
concert 
got 
me 
thinking, and the more I 
think about it, the more I 
realize that “riffing” on other 
people’s work is a trademark 
of nearly every type of art, 
including literature. The first 
example that comes to mind 
(perhaps a problematic one) 
is Bob Dylan’s “Chronicles: 
Volume 
One,” 
which 
came 
under 
criticism 
for 
appropriating a wide variety 
of sources without attributing 
proper credit. When I brought 
this up to my friend who loves 
Dylan, she said yes, she knew 
it didn’t look good, but this is 
what Dylan does — he’s a folk 
singer, he borrows old lines 
and ideas and rearranges them 
and finds a way to make them 
his own. I think that this is 
fair up to a certain extent, but 

if I were one of those people 
whose words Dylan had used, 
I might feel differently.
But then again, there is 
a definite tradition, in folk 
music and in folk literature 
— in all literature — of 
borrowing. “Borrow” is the 
word that we often use because 
it sounds a lot nicer 
than “steal,” which 
after 
all 
means 
“plagiarize.” 
But 
isn’t 
stealing 
what 
it 
is? 
It’s 
not like we give 
anything 
back, 
right? 
There’s 
a 
famous 
quotation 
attributed to Pablo 
Picasso: 
“Good 
artists copy; great 
artists steal.”
I’ve been writing since I 
was very little, but even back 
then, it never came completely 
naturally; I paid attention 
to the way it looked on the 
page, the lengths of sentences 
and the distribution between 
paragraphs and dialogue, and 

mostly just copied the way 
that I saw other people doing 
it. These days my writing style 
is a little bit more specific 
to me, but I still borrow 
extremely heavily from other 
people. Just within the last 
year or so I’ve written one 
short story based entirely on 
the lyrics from a John Prine 
song, and another with a 
narrative voice that I basically 
shoplifted from John Updike’s 
story “A&P.” The stories are 
independent 
creations, 
of 
course, but I still would have 
written them very differently 
— or not at all — if it weren’t 
for Prine and Updike.
But “plagiarism” is indeed 
a sharp word for this sort 
of 
thing, 
and 
one 
that’s 
inherently 
negative. 
Of 
course, it’s negative for good 
reason, and it’s not up to me 
to try to figure out where 
the line is between the bad 
kind of stealing and the good 
kind. For instance, one could 
argue — and many have — 
that fan-fiction is also a form 
of plagiarism. I personally 
think that, like any other 
type of writing, there is value 
in fan-fiction as a writing 
exercise, but that’s a topic for 
another time. Maybe the line 
is 
between 
acknowledging 
your source and leaving it out. 
Or maybe it has something to 
do with the division between 
what you’re saying and how 
you’re saying it — and as long 
as you’re doing one of those 
things in a new way, you’re 
doing something right.
Obviously, I’m not going to 
defend people who straight-
up copy other people’s work 
and try to take credit for it. 
But on the other end of the 
spectrum, I’m not sure that I 
entirely believe people when 
they say that their work is 
completely original. I think 
the truth really exists in some 
middle ground, one in which 
reworking other people’s ideas 
— as long as you do it in an 
original way and acknowledge 
their influence — is one of the 
best-established 
and 
most 
time-worn traditions in any 
art form. It’s not really for me 
to say either way, but I think 
it’s at least worth thinking 
about.
And yes, I know I’m not the 
first person to say that.

Festival 2018

“Foxtrot” 

is a film that 

undoubtedly 

shocks, 

hypnotizes and 

moves us. It’s 

definitely worth 

seeking out


On Saturday, Jan. 27, student 
organization EnspiRED hosted 
their 12th annual charity fashion 
show, entitled “RAW,” at the 
Alfred A. Taubman Biomedical 
Research Building.
“Every year, the show is formed 
after some good theme that’s 
based upon social experience,” 
said Travis Jones, an LSA senior 
and model in the show. “This 
year’s theme is RAW, and I feel 
like that’s a big social experience 
that a lot of people can relate to.”
Spoiler alert: He was right.
From my vantage point, the 
first three of the show’s six 
“chapters” featured some distinct 
form 
of 
social 
commentary. 
Chapter one brought attendees 
a 
critique 
of 
consumerism, 
featuring traditional hallmarks 
of luxury — think fur, gemstones 
and shopping bags from high-
end stores — interspersed with 
more forward-thinking pieces, 
like Nicopanda x Urban Outfitters 
puffer pieces and the ubiquitous 
Kurt Cobain sunglasses. Chapter 
two gave us an assessment of “eat, 
sleep, work” capitalist culture, 
complete with zombie-walking 
models clad in workwear with 
slight eccentricities (a blazer with 
no shirt beneath, a trench coat belt 
around the head) and set to the 
soundtrack of Kendrick Lamar’s 
“LUST.” Chapter three subverted 
prescribed gender norms, sending 
the girls out in leather, buckles 
and lace-up boots, while the 
boys worked the runway in sheer 
fabrics, tight pants and one very 
niche shag coat reminiscent of Big 
Bird.
Cut to intermission. Show 
staff brought out free pizzas for 
the audience, and I felt like I was 
on Oprah. Soon enough, it was 
time for the classic intermission 
runway walk challenge — an 
oldie, but a goodie. Two little girls 
rocked it together, and the entire 
audience melted, still munching 
on their Domino’s.
After a few PSAs from some 
impeccably 
dressed 
students 
with walkie-talkies, it was time 

for Chapters four through six. 
Chapter four presented us with 
all things satin, velvet, iridescent 
and glittery, accented with PVC 
purses and jackets. One orange 
spaghetti-strapped dress seemed 
to glow beneath a set of ultraviolet 
spotlights.
At this point, I thought I’d seen 
the sexiest of it; there had already 
been plenty of shirtless boys and 
a handful of girls wearing only 
leotards. Then, RAW brought 
us Chapter five, coming in hot 
and heavy and ready to prove me 
wrong.
The chapter opened with a 
seamless routine by two pole 
dancers dressed in silver and 
white. Accompanied by a soft, 
throbbing melody, the women 
continued even as models walked 
the runway, dressed appropriately 
for the sensual mood set by the 
gravity-defying 
performance. 
They sported a variety of lacey, 
undone numbers, as though they 
just rolled out of bed, but Tyra 
Banks asked them to “make it 
fashion.” We transitioned to a few 
girls in lingerie, with some boys 
wearing satin robes over jeans. As 
is the norm at an EnspiRED event, 
the audience ate everything up. 
Shouts of liberation and pride 
rang through the space as the 
dancers contorted themselves in 
tandem (“Yes, ladies!”), as models 
openly loved every square inch 
of themselves (“That’s right! 
Do you!”). Chapter five served 
as a reminder of how beautiful 
sexuality can be when we decide 
to see it as an asset, rather than a 
flaw. It was a celebration of every 
beating heart in the room, not 
only the models and staff.
Chapter six took a turn back 
to the streamlined, though not 
accompanied 
by 
an 
explicit 
theme. Earthy colors in trendy 
silhouettes dominated, with the 
exception of one pair of thigh 
high, crystal-studded boots, à 
la Saint Laurent spring summer 
2018. From six, we moved onto the 
highlight of the night: EnspiRED’s 
community involvement segment.
This year’s show raised over 
$900 (and counting) for Ozone 
House, explained Asia Green, an 
LSA sophomore and EnspiRED’s 

community 
service 
chair. 
According to a representative, 
Ozone has been serving the 
Washtenaw community for over 
50 
years 
through 
providing 
intervention 
and 
prevention 
services to at-risk, and often 
homeless, youth.
“EnspiRED is more than just 
fashion. It’s community,” she said 
before introducing the performers 
of SpeakOut, a branch of Ozone 
House comprised of formerly 
homeless youth who tell their 
stories to other communities.
SpeakOut 
performed 
one 
poem, “School,” and a short 
excerpt from an original play 
called “Foster Care.” Both left 
the once lively audience without 
words.
Reinforcing their emphasis on 
community, 
RAW 
culminated 
with a final model walk, or what 
EnspiRED dubbed, “the Red 
Scene.” All participating models 
returned to the runway wearing 
red, white and black, clearly 
having loosened up since their 
last jaunts onstage. Some danced, 
some sang along to the show’s 
blaring soundtrack, while others 
maintained their high-fashion 
alter egos to the bitter end. The 
Red Scene was followed by a 
similar victory lap by EnspiRED’s 
executive board to seal everything 
off. The personality that emerged 
from each left the crowd smiling 
and laughing and dancing in, and 
out of, their seats.
“I feel like we have a very 
diverse group of of people,” said 
Valencia Jackson, an EnspiRED 
model and LSA junior. “I mean, 
you talk to people from EnspiRED, 
and they’re in everything from 
engineering to dance and music 
and everything. As far as the 
scale of EnspiRED, we do a lot 
of charity, a lot of philanthropy 
and our productions are the 
best (laughs). I think that’s what 
separates us.”
EnspiRED’s 
12th 
annual 
show conveyed honest truths of 
the human experience through 
fashion, while still maintaining 
a central focus of community-
building and giving. To be equal 
parts critical and loving — that’s 
what it means to be RAW.

EnspiRED sexy and ‘RAW’

STYLE REVIEW

TESS GARCIA
Daily Style Editor

Renowned cardiologist, clinical 
professor and bestselling author 
Dr. Joel Kahn spoke at Literati on 
Thursday to promote his new book, 
“The Plant-Based Solution.” In his 
book, Kahn explores the benefits 
of following a vegan diet through 
scientific research. Kahn proposes 
a compelling argument for plant-
based nutrition, both for general 
health and the prevention and 
reversal of chronic illnesses.
“The 
Plant-Based 
Solution” 
draws from Kahn’s many years of 
medical and personal experience to 
encourage readers to use veganism 
to take control of their own health. 
Kahn himself has been following a 
plant-based diet since he was 18.
“I walked into the East Quad 
dormitory in Ann Arbor in 1977 
to start the Inteflex combined 
premed-medical program,” Kahn 
wrote in an email interview with 
The Daily. “I was observing Kosher 
dietary rules and the salad bar was 
the obvious option. Soon after, 
a few places like the salad bar at 
Pretzel Bell on Liberty, the market 
at Kerrytown, and ... Zingermans 
indicated to me I could do this all 
the time ... The last time I had a 
hamburger and such was in 1977. I 
started to learn about nutrition in 
medical school (just a bit but enough 
for me to pursue studies on my own) 
and I became a student of the health, 
environmental and compassionate 
foundations for a vegan diet.”
Though there is often suspicion 
surrounding plant-based diets, by 
both the medical community and 
the general public, Kahn explains 
that veganism is the most health-
conscious diet an individual could 
follow.
“There is never enough nutrition 
science as it is very hard to organize 

and fund long term studies where 
group A eats one way and group 
B eats another,” he wrote. “So 
you have to take clues from five 
areas of science: basic research, 
studies of long lived populations, 
epidemiology, randomized trials 
and the study of complex systems. 
Most fad diets have at best one of 
these pillars. Take the ketogenic 
diet — the rage right now. It has at 
best a few epidemiological studies 
but none of the others. A diet of 
nearly or completely plant foods has 
the strongest support based on all of 
these pillars.”
In addition to health benefits, 
the vegan diet is beneficial in the 
context of the environment, due 
to America’s often inhumane and 
environmentally 
detrimental 
farming practices.
“Initially (my influence to go 
vegan) was ‘survival’ and then 
health,” Kahn wrote. “A book in 
the 1980s appeared, ‘A Diet for A 
New America,’ by John Robbins 
which indicated to me for the first 
time that a bigger picture of ethical 
and 
environmental 
concerns 
were favored by my diet, and I 
incorporated those reasons to stay 
on target.”
Kahn also dispelled arguments 
about the accessibility of veganism, 
for it is broadly considered expensive 
and inconvenient: “Veganism is the 
hottest food trend internationally 
and it will be sustained,” he wrote. 
“The tipping point has occurred. 
It may need to be negotiated 
during travel, and I often eat only 
side dishes at restaurants like a 
steakhouse. A website called www.
happycow.net 
lists 
restaurants 
anywhere in the world to help out. 
If budget is an issue then beans 
— dried or canned — rice or other 
grains like buckwheat, frozen or 
fresh produce, herbs and spices 
and a few sauces can make infinite 
number of combinations.”

“The native diet of remote 
areas in Asia, Africa and South 
America are largely whole food 
complex-carbohydrate 
menus 
from the garden and market, and 
we need to go back to those roots,” 
he continued. “A friend of mine in 
Detroit is a nursing educator and 
travels to Indian reservations in 
the Southwest to retrain Native 
Americans in the foods their 
ancestors ate and get them off of 
government subsidized disease-
causing foods. We all need to shun 
some of the convenience foods that 
have destroyed our health.”
Even from my perspective as 
a vegan, Kahn’s conversation at 
Literati was illuminating. Though 
I find myself answering questions 
(often rather defensively) about my 
diet, I’ve never answered them in 
the context of a medical perspective. 
I often fall back on my undying love 
for animals and mission of single 
handedly saving the environment 
to explain my personal decisions 
— which usually results in both me 
and my meat-eating opponent either 
laughing or falling into an awkward 
post-argument silence.
Kahn, 
however, 
provides 
concrete medical evidence for 
the benefits veganism in both his 
speech and writing — evidence that 
can enlighten carnivores and that 
can save vegans in any argument.
Through his work, Kahn allows 
space for readers and listeners to 
consider what they are putting 
into their bodies and why. He 
dispels 
common 
assumptions 
around veganism, such as suspicion 
around 
nutrition, 
executability 
and accessibility, and forms his 
argument in an unbiased, fact-
based way. His speaking and 
writing is accessible to vegans, the 
vegan-curious and the die-hard 
carnivores interested in learning 
about veganism from a medical 
standpoint.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

JENNA BARLAGE

HBO’s “Divorce” examines the 
messy and exhausting process of 
ending a marriage, with a specific 
brand of comedic neuroses. Sarah 
Jessica Parker (“All Roads Lead 
to Rome”) and Thomas Haden 
Church 
(“Cardboard 
Boxer”) 
co-star as Frances and Robert, a 
couple whose slow drift apart from 
one another leads to an aggressive 
and hostile feud, playing out with 
upper-middle 
class 
suburban 
flare. But what would otherwise 
be 
a 
contrived 
narrative 
of 
divorce is elevated with sharp 
writing and well-timed comedic 
performances. While Parker is 
refreshingly better than her usual 
melodramatic self, Church carries 
the show, being both sincere, 
comedically 
vindictive 
and 
a 
nimble wordsmith.
“Divorce” 
is 
preoccupied 
with the process of separation — 
the lengthy back and forth that 
involves spouses, children and 
friends. Season one showed that 
this awkward and unique process 
is rich in comedic material and 
psychological explorations into 
what it looks like when a 10-year 
marriage quickly crumbles. With 
honesty and sentimentality, the 

season showed that Frances and 
Robert could still have moments 
of sweetness among moments 
of chaos and acid. It was an 
entertaining, funny and candid 
portrayal of a broken marriage that 
doesn’t break cleanly.

Unfortunately, season two is 
a shadow of its former self. The 
change became evident in the first 
episode, when Robert shaved his 
notorious mustache and effectively 
transformed from the sharp lead to 
a sort of melted, pathetic skin sack. 
Parker also lost her momentum, 
fading back into the breathy 
theatrical act that works in “Sex 
and the City” and nowhere else.
With season two, it feels like 
the show doesn’t really know what 
to do with itself. After Robert and 
Frances finally sign their divorce 
papers in the first episode, the 
season drags on aimlessly, flitting 
between their different flings and 
job endeavors without the spice 
and fire of the first season. The 

auxiliary characters are also more 
annoying. Molly Shannon (“Will 
and Grace”) plays Frances’s best 
friend with a tired performativity 
that completely undercuts her 
skills as a comedian and a nuanced 
actor. Tracey Letts (“Lady Bird”), 
another Hollywood genius, is 
reduced to a man with anger issues 
and a random obsession with 
gourmet cooking. Even the kids 
are obnoxious, picking fights and 
whining for the sole purpose of 
adding noise to a scene.
“Divorce” started out strong 
as a show about middle-age 
problems 
with 
a 
universally 
resonant brand of comedy and 
intelligence. 
With 
its 
second 
season, the show completely loses 
its footing, fumbling between 
problems that aren’t problems, 
overdramatized characters and 
situations and an overall sense of 
pathetic sadness that comes with 
people who have separated but 
can’t quite seem to get over each 
other. It lacks the vitriolic bouts of 
anger, the calculated “fuck you”s, 
and the acute hilarity of it all. The 
thing is, Frances and Robert seem 
fine being divorced, but season 
two is washed-out and stringy, 
struggling to make an amicable 
post-divorce relationship dramatic 
and interesting, and failing to do 
so.

Wolverines swept by sixth-ranked Buckeyes

OLUMBUS — 
Ohio State has 
notoriously won 
games this season 
by gaining a first-

goal advantage. The Buckeyes had 
done so in 11 of their 16 wins prior 
to Saturday night, emblematic of a 
team that can hold onto early-game 
momentum.

Given this, when freshman 

forward Jack Becker cracked Ohio 
State’s net first, the Michigan 
hockey team — who hadn’t seen 
a single goal Friday night — was 
provided with a glimpse of hope.

But Saturday, this stat wouldn’t 

matter. The Buckeyes didn’t score 
first. However, with another lights-
out performance on their home turf, 
they didn’t need to.

After being neutralized the night 

before, No. 17 Michigan started 
strong, but eventually deteriorated. 
For the second time this season, No. 
6 Ohio State (10-5-1-0 Big Ten, 17-5-
4 overall) swept the Wolverines (7-9-
2-1, 12-12-2), this time handing them 
a 5-3 defeat.

For Michigan, who had been able 

to cruise past Minnesota and Penn 
State in its previous two weekends, 
the series in Columbus served as a 
wake-up call of sorts.

“We may have been getting by, 

and as coaches, we knew that we 
had to clean some things up,” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson. “We 
got a little bit of a reality check 
this weekend. Ohio State is a very 
good hockey team, you can’t take 
anything away from them, but we 
made it too easy for them with the 
goals they scored all weekend.”

The game opened up sloppily, 

with an absence of smooth passing 
and urgency evident on both sides of 
the puck. 

Ohio State notched the first 

man-advantage 4:29 into the first 
period, as a tripping call sent senior 
defenseman Sam Piazza to the box. 
Despite many close opportunities 
and the fact that the Buckeyes 
capitalized more often than not on 
their power play the night before, 
the Wolverines escaped the penalty 
unharmed.

And less than three minutes later, 

Michigan did something it couldn’t 
all of Friday — find the net. Despite 

having two Ohio State blueliners 
wedged between him and the 
goal, Becker sent a long-range shot 
straight at the net, passing both the 
defensemen and Buckeye goaltender 
Sean Romeo to get the Wolverines 
on the board.

But Ohio State wouldn’t let this 

advantage stick for long. Halfway 
through the period, forward Freddy 
Gerard successfully tipped the puck 
in off a rebound, equalizing the 
game as Value City Arena erupted. 

In the final two minutes of 

the period, Michigan’s first line 
had a few dangerous chances 
in the Buckeye zone. However, 
the Wolverines were unable to 
capitalize a second time, sending 
both teams to the locker rooms tied 
neck-and-neck at 1-1. 

Ohio State had no desire to waste 

time coming out of the intermission. 
Just 26 seconds into the second 
period, Gerard broke away from 
a pack of Michigan defensemen, 
challenged sophomore goaltender 
Hayden Lavigne for the second time 
of the night, and again sent a blast 
past the netminder.

Holding a 2-1 lead, the Buckeyes 

were given the first power play of 

the second period, with a Wolverine 
penalty for roughing with 5:48 left in 
the frame. Michigan fended off the 
Buckeyes again, allowing just one 
on-target shot over the stretch.

Unfazed by their deficit, the 

Wolverines fired again midway 
through the period. Michigan’s 
fourth line would find the net for the 
second time that night, as freshman 
Dakota Raabe found Niko Porikos 
right outside the crease, and the 
senior lit the lamp for his first goal of 
the season.

And as the game presented a 

competitive energy completely 
absent the night before, it was not 
long before Ohio State’s offense 
challenged again. Three minutes 
after Michigan’s goal, Buckeye 
forward Ronnie Hein fired the puck 
past Lavigne to gain a 3-2 edge.

With just over three minutes 

remaining in the second, the back 
and forth nature of the game 
quickly came to a halt. Ohio State 
forward Brendon Kearney found the 
Wolverine net, widening the gap to 
two for the largest lead of the night. 
The Buckeyes demonstrated their 
offensive depth, with three different 
lines supplementing the night’s four 

goals thus far.

“I just did not like our defensive 

awareness, and our puck 
management tonight was not good 
and led to two or three of their 
goals,” Pearson said. “I wouldn’t say 
their goals were unearned, we just 
can’t play like that against a team 
like Ohio State. We knew how they 
play and we talked about managing 
the puck tonight and we just did not 
do a good job of that.”

Though Michigan was unable 

to answer, Ohio State incurred an 
elbowing penalty with 12 seconds 
remaining in the period, giving the 
Wolverines their first power play of 
the game to start the third.

This man-advantage was fruitless 

for Michigan, as it was shut down by 
the Buckeyes’ penalty kill — the top 
in the nation — that boasts an elite 
.905 average.

Because of this, the Wolverines 

had been looking anemic on their 
power play all weekend. Ohio State 
saw a few close opportunities for 
short-handed goals Friday night that 
fell flat, but this would no longer be 
the case during the second half of 
Saturday’s third period. With 8:12 
dwindling in the game, Buckeye 

forward Mason Jobst broke away 
with the puck, evading Lavigne with 
a short-handed blast, tacking on a 
fifth Ohio State goal.

The Buckeyes continued their 

dominance on the penalty kill, 
preventing Michigan from finding 
the net while the Wolverines were 
on a significant two-man advantage.

With 2:30 left on the clock, 

Michigan attempted a final late-
game rally as sophomore forward 
Jake Slaker scored, bringing the 
game to 5-3. 

“I think I was kind of like, ‘Well, 

we’ve got two minutes, we could 
try to get back in this,’ ” Slaker said. 
“But it was also super frustrating, 
because it was so late.”

At this point in the game, every 

Wolverine on the ice exhibited this 
same frustration. Michigan had just 
come off two competitive series in 
which it had claimed all the points. 
This weekend, it walked away with 
none.

“Obviously, it’s not good enough,” 

Porikos said. “Coming in here, 
leaving with no points, it’s not what 
we wanted. But it is what it is.”

Added Slaker: “There’s not much 

to say after a weekend like that.”

Plagued by season-long problems, Wolverines swept at No. 6 Ohio State

COLUMBUS — The No. 6 Ohio 

State hockey team can do it all.

On offense, it scored 3.62 

goals per game in its last eight 
coming into this past weekend. 
Unsurprisingly, the Buckeyes are 
the only team with three of the Big 
Ten’s top-10 scorers.

Their defense ranks fourth in the 

country, allowing just 2.04 goals 
per game and two or fewer goals in 
17 of 26 contests.

And Ohio State’s special teams 

are as well-rounded as any in 
collegiate hockey. Its penalty kill 
stops 90.82 percent of power plays 
to rank first in the NCAA — the only 
team over 90 percent.

After starting the season 0-for-

20 on the power play through their 
first four games, the Buckeyes now 
have the fifth-best power-play 
unit since Oct. 19, converting 25.58 
percent on the man advantage. In 
its previous five games before the 
weekend, Ohio State was 9-for-47 
— a whopping 40.1 percent.

So when No. 17 Michigan 

traveled to Columbus to face 
its archrival, the problems that 
plagued the Wolverines throughout 
the season played right to the 
Buckeyes’ strengths. For Michigan, 
turnovers in the defensive zone, an 
inability to create quality scoring 
chances and a failure to execute 
on special teams were all on 
display Friday and Saturday night, 
resulting in an Ohio State sweep for 

the second time this season.

The Buckeyes jumped on every 

opportunity to exploit holes in the 
Wolverines’ game that had largely 
been forgotten during Michigan’s 
four-game winning streak entering 
the weekend.

“It was a little bit of a wake-up 

call for us,” said Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson after Saturday’s 5-3 
loss. “We may have been getting by 
and as coaches, we knew that we 
had to clean some things up. We 
got a little bit of a reality check this 
weekend.”

Atop the list were mental lapses 

on defense, as the Wolverines 
continuously failed to clear the 

puck from their zone. Michigan 
currently ranks 41 out of 60 schools 
in 
team 
defense. 
Meanwhile, 

the Buckeyes aren’t prone to 
squandering 
scoring 
chances 

handed to them off miscues.

Friday night, turnovers allowed 

for considerable Ohio State odd-
man rushes — more than Pearson 
says he had seen in the previous four 
games combined — and subsequent 
goals. Twenty-four hours later, 
more errant passes near the 
blueline contributed to Michigan’s 
downfall. The most glaring was 
an 
obvious 
miscommunication 

between freshman forward Josh 
Norris and his teammates, resulting 

in a two-on-one advantage and the 
Buckeyes’ third goal of the night.

“We have to get back to our game 

and we have to manage the puck 
better,” Pearson said. “We talk 
about it all the time — and you’re 
probably tired of me saying it — but 
you can on see the goals that they 
got this weekend, we got caught out 
of position, we’re thinking too much 
on the offense, turned the puck over 
in some bad spots that led to some of 
their goals.”

Michigan was also caught out of 

position on the penalty kill, where 
it ranks sixth-worst in the country 
with a meager 76.24 percent success 
rate. Though the Wolverines held 
Ohio State 0-for-5 Saturday on the 
power play, the Buckeyes’ 2-for-3 
performance the night before gave 
them their second and fourth goals 
— insurance that solidified a home-
team win in the series opener.

All the while, the Wolverines 

struggled on the power play, going 
0-for-7 for the weekend. Ohio State 
consistently outmuscled Michigan 
for possession, easily clearing the 
puck and creating shorthanded 
rushes.

Saturday night, the Buckeyes 

notched a shorthanded tally on the 
penalty kill when forward Mason 
Jobst split the Wolverine defenders 
and beat sophomore goaltender 
Hayden Lavigne for his team’s fifth 
goal of the game, all but sealing the 
sweep.

Michigan 
is 
the 
nation’s 

13th-worst team on the power play 
— converting a dismal 15 percent 
of its chances — and it showed the 
entire series. In the third period 
Saturday, the Wolverines found 
themselves 
on 
a 
five-on-three 

advantage for 1:20 following two 
Ohio State penalties. But against 
the best penalty kill unit around, 
the puck never found the back of the 
net.

“You’re not going to get many 

‘grade-A chances,’ ” Pearson said. 
“We did have a few on that five-on-
three, but that was the difference. 
They capitalized on their scoring 
chances and we couldn’t. We’ve got 
to get a little hungrier around the 
net, especially in those situations.”

These problems carried over to 

even strength, where Michigan 
was continuously limited with 
quality shots on goal, coupled 
with impressive saves by Buckeye 
goaltender Sean Romero.

“We just have to get back to the 

basics, keep everything simple,” said 
sophomore forward Jake Slaker, 
who scored the Wolverines’ third 
goal with 2:30 left in Saturday’s 
contest. “Get pucks deep, get in a 
forecheck and get back to the game 
we know we can play. It was one 
of those weekends where bounces 
weren’t going our way and we 
weren’t playing the way we need to 
play.”

As 
Saturday 
night’s 
game 

progressed, it looked more and more 
unlikely Michigan would salvage a 
series split. With frustration boiling 
over for the visitors, pushing and 
shoving ensued after seemingly 
every 
whistle. 
Five 
roughing 

penalties were assessed to the 
Wolverines en route to a season-
high nine trips to the box.

Despite Pearson stressing the 

importance of managing the game 
and controlling emotions, Michigan 
was far past listening to either.

“I was pretty frustrated, it was a 

tough night and tough weekend for 
myself,” Slaker, an assistant captain, 
said. “It starts with the leadership, 
and you know, I’m one of the leaders 
on this team, and I didn’t bring it 
this weekend.”

Following Saturday night’s loss, 

the consistent media questions 
about the Wolverines’ sore spots 
continued. And Pearson’s answers 
remained the same, as they have 
for most of the season — a lack of 

defensive smarts, inconsistencies 
on special teams and not scoring 
when favorable shots presented 
themselves. Pearson heavily focuses 
on reversing weaknesses in practice, 
which doesn’t always pay off when 
the lights shine brightest against the 
best of the best like Ohio State.

Maybe Pearson didn’t have to 

address those issues as much the 
previous two weekends, when 
Michigan looked like a viable NCAA 
Tournament contender. It may have 
gotten away with the mistakes 
against then-No. 9 Minnesota and 
then-No. 12 Penn State during its 
most recent hot streak, but the 
Buckeyes made sure to punish the 
Wolverines.

And Pearson’s metaphor from 

the first series between the teams 
this season — when Ohio State 
handed Michigan its first sweep on 
the year — stood true the second 
time around, too.

“The makeup came off and 

we saw a lot of the blemishes this 
weekend,” Pearson said Nov. 25. 
“We were able to cover some things 
up, (but) this weekend we saw a 
little bit of some of the issues that 
we’re going to have going forward.”

The makeup from the last two 

weekends have finally been washed 
off, and the blemishes shown 
through in spades.

Pearson partially chalks the 

setbacks up to youth and Ohio 
State’s plethora of talented veterans, 
a group that makes him believe the 
Buckeyes may be one of the nation’s 
two best teams.

“They’ve got juniors and seniors 

sprinkled through their lineup 
and they play like that,” Pearson 
said. “They play with that patience 
and a little bit of confidence that a 
young team like us didn’t have this 
weekend.”

However, players believe the 

weekend was within their grasp — 
youth be damned — but got away.

“It’s one of those things where 

any night any team can win,” 
Slaker said. “Tonight and last night 
weren’t our games, but they could 
have easily been our games. We 
could have come out of here with 
six points and two wins, but that 
just didn’t happen that way this 
weekend.

“We don’t think about how good 

they are, we just think about how 
bad we played.”

Time’s up

M

y journalistic scope 
is usually limited to 
Michigan athletics, 

but the most important sports 
story of the 
week didn’t 
happen in 
Ann Arbor.

It happened 

in East 
Lansing.

There have 

been plenty 
of voices 
speaking out 
about the 
devastating 
events of the past week, but I 
want to add mine to the chorus. I 
am a woman in a male-dominated 
field, and as much as this has been 
treated as a news story, it is also a 
sports story about female athletes 
in a male-dominated sphere. A 
story about sexual assault run 
rampant and a culture of silence 
that enabled its existence.

Unfortunately, it is not the 

first such story. But it is arguably 
the biggest sports scandal in the 
history of collegiate athletics. And 
as such, it has made it clear that 
this is a reality we have accepted 
for far too long. We cannot afford 
to continue to do so any longer.

After a year in which histories 

of sexual abuse throughout 
the entertainment and media 
industries entered public 
consciousness in harrowing 
fashion, the sports landscape 
seemed to escape relatively 
unscathed. But what is done in 
the dark always eventually comes 
out into the light.

It has been a week of reckoning 

for the Michigan State athletic 
department.

Last Wednesday, former USA 

Gymnastics and Michigan State 
University doctor Larry Nassar 
was sentenced to 40 to 175 
years in prison for first-degree 
sexual misconduct — on top of 
his 60-year federal sentence on 
charges of child pornography. In 
an Ingham County courthouse, 
upon the order of Judge 
Rosemarie Aquilina, justice was 

served. But that shouldn’t be the 
only repercussion.

One hundred and fifty-six 

women, survivors of sexual abuse 
at the hands of the formerly 
famed physician and their 
families, dug deep and delivered 
detailed accounts of the pain they 
have suffered over the past three 
decades. Those women shed light 
on medical appointments that 
turned into sites of molestation, 
traumatic memories that haunt 
them to this very day and a flawed 
athletic system that kept them 
silent until now.

Their testimonies were called 

impact statements inside the 
courthouse. They have certainly 
lived up to that billing outside of 
it as well.

Branding themselves as an 

army of survivors, those women 
put the country on notice to 
a dangerous mentality that 
circulates throughout the sports 

landscape. As one of the most 
popular structures in our society, 
sports have frequently been given 
a pass when defamatory incidents 
garner national attention, 
whether in regard to domestic 
violence, drunk driving or sexual 
assault. And that is just the tip of 
the iceberg.

Stories are written and soon 

forgotten. Cases are reported 
and later discarded. Realities are 
acknowledged and then ignored. 
As much as institutions shoulder 
the blame, we should share in it.

The truth is that we all have 

turned a blind eye, pretending 
that those faults don’t exist or that 
they don’t matter. After all, it is 
easier to stomach a heartbreaking 
loss in a championship game 
than a star player raping a fellow 
student the night before.

In the case of the team doctor 

who molested young girls under 
the guise of medical treatment, 

the army of survivors once had 
their voices stripped away from 
them as well. Their innocence 
was masked as ignorance in order 
to manipulate them.

In a highly competitive sport 

where one misstep can be the 
difference between a gold medal 
around a neck or a red target 
on a back, they fell victim to the 
culture of silence. Hidden in 
the locked rooms of the arena 
is a fertile breeding ground for 
powerful men to take advantage 
of vulnerable girls.

After the moving accounts 

delivered in that courthouse, it is 
now nearly impossible to brush 
off the gravity of the situation. 
Michigan State learned that the 
hard way. 

Longtime university president 

Lou Anna Simon stepped down 
Wednesday night after the state’s 
House of Representatives put 
pressure on the school’s Board 

of Trustees. Athletic director 
Mark Hollis did the same Friday 
morning, after he learned of a 
forthcoming report from ESPN’s 
Outside the Lines that uncovered 
a disturbing pattern of sexual 
abuse and insidious denial in his 
athletic department. Based on 
its contents, football coach Mark 
Dantonio and men’s basketball 
coach Tom Izzo could also 
potentially be implicated in the 
far-reaching scandal.

That might not even be the 

end of the ramifications for the 
university, particularly after its 
Board of Trustees’ insultingly 
brazen response to Nassar’s 
sentencing hearing. Last Tuesday, 
vice chairman Joel Ferguson 
claimed that, “There’s so many 
more things going on at the 
university than just this Nassar 
thing,” before the whole board 
apologized for its “collective 
inaction” Friday.

Due to rising public outrage 

over its part in enabling Nassar, 
the United States Olympic 
Committee demanded that the 
entire board of directors of USA 
Gymnastics resign. Friday, they 
complied. Michigan State’s board 
may yet be forced to follow suit.

As encouraging as those 

developments are, there is still 
much work to be done to combat 
one of the most sinister epidemics 
in our society. If we are serious 
about addressing the havoc that 
sexual assault has wreaked across 
the country, then it’s time for the 
punishment to fit the crime.

Nassar isn’t the only one who 

deserves jail time. It’s time for his 
accomplices to face the same fate.

Michigan State covered up 

allegations of sexual abuse for 
three decades, the extent of which 
still isn’t fully known. University 
officials protected a criminal, and 
those individuals need to be held 
accountable for their actions.

Someday, they — whoever 

they are and however many there 
are — need to sit in that Ingham 
County courthouse and receive 
a sentence for the crimes they 
allowed to happen. That is the 
only way to send a message that 
this behavior will not be tolerated.

Because this isn’t just about 

Michigan State.

Aly Raisman, who won two 

Olympic gold medals for the 
United States as part of the 
“Fierce Five” in 2012 and the 
“Final Five” in 2016, said it best in 
her impact statement.

“My dream is that one day, 

everyone will know what the 
words ‘me too’ signify,” she said. 
“But they will be educated and 
able to protect themselves from 
predators like (Nassar), so that 
they will never, ever, ever have to 
say the words, ‘me too.’ ”

The culture of silence in sports 

has gone on for far too long.

Time’s up.

Greg Ryan, Michigan part ways

For only the second time 

in program history, the 
Michigan women’s soccer 
team is looking for a new 
head coach.

Athletic director Warde 

Manuel announced Jan. 26 
that Greg Ryan won’t come 
back to Ann Arbor next year 
after serving as head coach 
for 10 seasons.

“It has been determined 

that Greg Ryan will not 
return 
as 
our 
women’s 

soccer 
coach,” 
Manuel 

said in a press release on 
MGoBlue.com. “We thank 
Greg for his 10 years of 
service 
and 
wish 
him 

success in the future.”

Prior 
to 
working 
at 

Michigan, Ryan was the 
head coach of the United 
States Women’s National 
Team 
for 
two 
years. 

The 
former 
professional 

soccer player most notably 
coached 
the 
national 

team at the 2007 Women’s 
World Cup, leading them 
to the quarterfinals. Before 
that, Ryan also coached 
at 
Wisconsin, 
Colorado 

College 
and 
Southern 

Methodist.

Ryan 
took 
over 
the 

program right after the 
World Cup from former head 
coach Debbie Rademacher, 
who stepped down after 
building 
the 
Wolverines’ 

program from scratch in 
1993. Rademacher finished 
3-9-6 in her last season. 
Ryan’s hire at the time 
was seen as a way to inject 
energy into a stale program; 
Michigan made the NCAA 
Tournament in nine out 
Rademacher’s 14 years, but 
didn’t advance past the first 
round in any of her last four 
seasons.

But 
the 
Wolverines 

followed an eerily similar 
path under Ryan as they did 
under Rademacher. During 
his tenure, Ryan amassed a

‘M’ falls to No. 1 Oklahoma

Anthony 
McCallum’s 
vault 

looked good in the air.

The junior sprinted down the 

runway, did a half-turn onto the 
table and catapulted himself high 
into the air before performing 
two backflips. But as he landed, 
he over-rotated his second flip 
and fell forward.

It was, in a way, a metaphor 

for the No. 9 Michigan men’s 
gymnastics 
team’s 
meet. 

Despite leading through the 
fourth rotation, the Wolverines 
ultimately fell to No. 1 Oklahoma, 
411.650-403.650.

Of course, competing with 

Oklahoma — whose 82-meet 
winning streak is the longest 
currently in NCAA in any sport — 
is no easy task.

And while Michigan outscored 

the Sooners in the floor exercise, 
the 
event 
foreshadowed 
the 

inconsistency that would plague 
the 
Wolverines 
throughout 

the meet. Redshirt junior Alec 
Krystek — a walk-on who has 
elevated himself to co-captain 
— hit a near-perfect routine, 
sticking four of his six tumbling 
passes for a 14.5 — the highest 
floor score of the afternoon by 
nearly half a point.

“(He) competed three events, 

counted on all three, won floor,” 
said Michigan coach Kurt Golder. 
“It’s just, he’s getting the job 
done.”

But 
immediately 
after 

Krystek’s routine, senior Dmitri 
Belanovski fell twice and received 
a meager 10.6, forcing Michigan 
to count an earlier score of 11.7.

On pommel horse — a historical 

weakness 
— 
the 
Wolverines 

flipped the script. Michigan hit 
all six routines and outscored 
Oklahoma by over two points 
on the event. And despite the 
loss, the pommel horse was a big 
accomplishment in and of itself.

“It’s just part of the progress 

showing up,” Golder said.

But the Wolverines forfeited 

the advantage they had built 
on still rings and vault. Though 
clean, 
their 
routines 
lacked 

difficulty 
compared 
to 
the 

Sooners. McCallum, the reigning 
NCAA 
vault 
champion, 
was 

supposed to remedy that, but he 
was unable to execute.

“He’s had a couple of rough 

weeks,” Golder said. “He needs 
to take a step back, and you need 
to do that in this sport a lot of 
times … sometimes you have 
to take a step back, go back to 
the basics, perfect your basics, 
attack it again and work your way 
forward.”

Just as McCallum couldn’t 

hold onto his vault landing, 
Michigan couldn’t hold onto its 
lead. Though the Wolverines led 
by a slim margin after the fourth 
rotation, the Sooners put on a 
clinic on parallel bars and high 
bar to claim the lead after the 
fifth rotation.

Michigan, 
meanwhile, 

showcased some impressive skills 
— McCallum’s 5.8 difficulty rating 
on parallel bars was second-
highest of the competitors — but 
lacked consistency. Even if they 
didn’t fall, many gymnasts had 
form breaks or costly steps on the 
landings.

“You 
saw 
(a) 
three-time 

national championship team,” 
Golder said. “They’re down with 
two events to go. They got tougher. 
They got more enthusiastic. We 
got a little bit quieter.”

Still, it would take near-

perfection for any team to beat 
Oklahoma, and that Michigan 
came close is a good sign. 
Though the ultimate result was 
disappointment, the Wolverines 
can 
approach 
the 
rest 
of 

their season with newfound 
confidence.

“If 
you’re 
gonna 
win 

championships, you have to beat 
the best teams in the country,” 
Golder said. “We had them on the 
ropes, and we ended up losing to 
them. But hopefully, we showed 
ourselves that we can compete 
with them.”

Running inspired: Erin Finn makes history

Last week, Erin Finn made 

history at the Simmons-Harvey 
Quad.

After running an astounding 

8:58.69 
in 
the 
3,000-meter, 

the fifth-year senior broke her 
own school record. After an 
injury-shortened 2017 season, 
the performance served as an 
emphatic announcement that 
Finn is back.

Finn is no stranger to injury. A 

recurring stress fracture in her 
foot had kept her from competing 
in her career’s biggest moments, 
devastating 
the 
promising 

athlete. Her first fracture came 
during her sophomore season 
where her absence detracted 
from an elite cross country team.

The injury bug then reared 

its ugly head again prior to her 
junior season, causing more 
devastating effects. Finn was 
robbed of a chance to compete 
at 
both 
the 
collegiate 
and 

Olympic levels and was forced 
to helplessly watch from the 
sidelines.

In her fifth and final season, 

Finn looks to make a lasting 
statement and craft a legacy that 
grows larger than her injuries. 
Now, in only the second meet 
of that campaign, she has set a 
school record.

“It felt like I was completing 

something,” Finn said. “I felt 
the joy of finally just completing 
something that I’ve been working 
towards. It’s been almost two 
years since I’ve PR’d in any of 
my distance events. I PR’d in 
the mile last year, but that’s not 
really one of my true events.”

This season will also be a 

significant one for Finn as she 
has spent her latest recovery 
period discovering what her life 
looks like outside of running. She 
ventured beyond the sole identity 
of being a runner and found new 
purpose in her running.

“I don’t run because I have 

to. I run because I love it,” Finn 
said. “My junior year I was 
setting unhealthy expectations 
for myself, so my performance 
wasn’t as great as I wanted it to 
be.

“That indoor season, and 

that outdoor season, I ended 
up getting hurt, so it was just a 
long road of getting healthy and 
then finally competing with joy. 
Competing free of having to do 
things but rather getting to do 
things.”

Finding the joy in running 

was not an easy task. After going 
through a lot of soul searching — 
and a campus ministry program 
called 
Athletes 

in Action — she 
finally 
feels 

ready to unlock 
her full potential 
on the track.

“Also, 
my 

faith 
is 
really 

important 
to 

me,” Finn said, 
“And I just know 
that I’ve been 
given gifts, and 
I want to use them with joy and 
not use them with fear.”

While pinning an athlete’s 

identity to an insatiable desire 
to compete and a relentless 
aggression may seem desirable, 
Finn has found both to be 
unhealthy, taking away from her 

ability to compete.

“Part of it was realizing that 

what I was doing last year wasn’t 
working,” 
Finn 
said. 
“Why 

would I impose these rules and 
miserable things on myself when 
I’m doing something I love?”

Finn is looking forward to 

contending in the future with a 
renewed sense of purpose, but 
sat out this past weekend as a 

group 
of 
less 

experienced 
runners 
took 

to the track at 
Saginaw 
Valley 

State’s Jet’s Pizza 
Invitational.

Those runners 

are where Finn 
was many years 
ago — striving to 
make names for 
themselves.

Now 
Finn 
is 
somewhere 

completely different. She is a 
four-time NCAA Championship 
runner up and has never been 
able to climb that final hill. The 
hope is now — with a redefined 
reason for performing — she 
finally can.

JACOB KOPNICK
Daily Sports Writer

103-64-36 (.596) record but 

finished this past season 3-5-3 
in Big Ten play (6-6-6 overall). 
Just like Rademacher’s teams, 
Michigan missed the NCAA 
Tournament 
its 
first 
three 

seasons with Ryan as the coach 
and followed that up with a 
period of relative success. Both 
coaches went as far as the NCAA 
quarterfinals.

Unlike 
his 
predecessor 

though, Ryan’s time as coach 
was marred by inconsistency. 
The 
Wolverines 
have 
not 

advanced past the first round 
of the tournament since 2013, 
when they made a run to the 

quarterfinals. Michigan hasn’t 
won a game in the Big Ten 
Tournament since 2015, either.

“I have enjoyed my time at 

the University of Michigan and 
appreciate the opportunity to 
lead 
these 
student-athletes,” 

Ryan said in the press release. 
“I am proud of our successes 
and look forward to my next 
professional opportunity.”

The athletic department has 

already started the process 
of looking for another coach. 
When 
asked 
for 
comment, 

the University referred The 
Michigan Daily to the press 
release.

“I don’t run 

because I have 
to. I run because 

I love it.”

Wolverines suffer first loss at Nebraska 

For a team that recorded the 

highest score in the nation two 
weeks ago, losing to a team ranked 
four spots behind them wasn’t 
exactly expected. 

But for the No. 8 Michigan 

women’s gymnastics team, that’s 
exactly 
what 
happened. 
The 

loss came at the hands of No. 12 
Nebraska, who stands undefeated 
this season with a 3-0 record. After 
the Wolverines suffered a season-
low vault total last week against 
Illinois, and barely managed to 
scrape out a win, troubles in the 
event contined to plague the team 
this weekend. But this time, it 
sentenced them to their first loss 
of the season, 196.875-196.525.

Michigan began the meet on 

an event that would end up being 
its second-best of the night — 
the uneven bars. Senior Paige 
Zaziski led the squad with a 9.875, 
finishing in a tie for second with 
the Cornhuskers’ Taylor Houchin. 
Freshman Lauren Farley was next 
with a 9.850 for fourth.

Out of the remaining four 

gymnasts, 
senior 
Brianna 

Brown and sophomore Polina 
Shchennikova recorded 9.825s, 
while junior Olivia Karas and 
freshman Syd Townsend rounded 
out the rotation with a 9.800 each. 
These scores would amount to 
the Wolverines’ most consistent 
rotation of the night and a final 
score of 49.175.

“We are a good bar team, but 

we’re equally as good on the 
other three events as well,” said 
Michigan coach Bev Plocki. “I 
expect that all four events are 
going to be consistent.”

The next rotation was anything 

but consistent. With an overall 
lackluster vault score of 48.875, 
Michigan 
again 
found 
itself 

outnumbered in the top five.

Zaziski claimed another 9.850 

for a third-place finish, while 
freshman Sydney Townsend was 
the only other gymnast to break 
the top five with a 9.800. But two 
scores of 9.775, one 9.675 and a 
9.275 were less than a point away 
from sentencing the Wolverines 
to their worst vault rotation of the 
year.

“I’m a little bit disappointed. I 

think that we underperformed in 
a couple of places, and Nebraska is 
too good of a team to be able to do 
that and think that you’ll be able to 
come away with a victory,” Plocki 
said. “We did poorly on vault … We 
were not at our best, but we did 
well enough on the other three 
events. But you can’t afford to do 
that on vaulting. We come out 
against Ohio State and rocked 
vault, and two weeks since, we 
haven’t been able to replicate that 
and I’m not really sure why.”

The following floor rotation 

was a highlight for Michigan, 
particularly from Emma McLean. 
The junior earned Michigan’s 
only event title of the night with 
a 9.950, and junior Olivia Karas 

followed with a 9.875 to tie for 
second.

But again, mishaps nagged 

the Wolverines. A 9.175 from 
senior Lauren Marinez on floor, 
combined with the rough patch 
on vault, was enough to deter 
Michigan from a chance at the top 
spot.

On the beam, that trend 

continued. While Zaziski, senior 
Brianna Brown and senior Lauren 
Marinez each scored a 9.850 to tie 
for third, it wasn’t enough to save 
the Wolverines from their first 
loss of the season.

“The routines are there, the 

talent and the ability are there, 
but it’s being able to dig down 
in your gut and pull out what 
you’re capable of doing under any 
circumstances,” Plocki said. “If we 
want to do well in the postseason, 
we’re going to have to learn how to 
fight and dig down and be able to 
get ourselves to our best each time 
we’re getting ready to perform. 
Right now, these past two weeks, 
I’m just not sure what the issue 
was or why we didn’t perform up 
to our capability.”

Michigan doesn’t have a lot of 

time to figure it out, because even 
though the postseason is still a 
few months away, conference 
competitiors 
Maryland 
and 

Michigan State are coming up 
within the next two weeks. 

And even if this team did tally 

the highest score in the nation two 
weeks ago, it hasn’t been the same 
since.

Michigan upsets No. 4 Iowa on the road

“(Iowa’s) atmosphere there is 

unreal,” said 197-pound fifth-year 
senior Kevin Beazley. “Their fans 
are ruthless.”

That is the atmosphere the 

seventh-ranked 
Michigan 

wrestling team had to face 
Saturday night. Any dual meet 
against a top five team is difficult, 
but facing the fourth-ranked 
Hawkeyes in their venerated 
Carver-Hawkeye Arena is another 
task entirely.

The Wolverines didn’t start 

the meet with any particular 
gumption, as three out of their 
first four matchups ended in 
defeat. 
The 
run 
included 
a 

technical fall in the first match 
at 125 pounds by third-ranked 
Hawkeye Spencer Lee against 
freshman Drew Mattin and 149-
pound redshirt sophomore Ben 
Lamantia getting pinned in the 
second period by second-ranked 
Brandon Sorensen.

From a team perspective, the 

lone bright spot for Michigan 
in those four matches was 133-
pound redshirt sophomore Stevan 
Micic, who won his match by 
major decision.

Heading into the fifth match 

the Wolverines were down 14-4 
and every bit lifeless.

Coming 
alive, 
however, 

redshirt junior Alec Pantaleo 
shifted the tide with a two-point 
takedown and two-point reversal 
consecutively, to win 5-2.

“I don’t think he wrestled that 

first period the way he wanted 
to,” said coach Joe McFarland. 
“I’ll tell you what he did a great 
job of though, is he rode that kid 
the second period. I think that 
put him in the driver’s seat. He 
accumulated his riding time and 
opened it up a little more in the 
third period. That was a big win 
for us.”

Even though Michigan saw 

a 14-7 deficit heading into the 
visitor’s locker room at the 
halfway point, spurred on by 
Pantaleo’s 
performance, 
the 

second part of the lineup began 
to shift the momentum in its 
direction.

“We were pretty calm going 

into halftime,” Beazley said. “We 
knew they had some studs that 
could put up some points against 
us, but we knew where our horses 
were and that we could finish 
strong.”

The Wolverines’ “horses” came 

through in a big way. Excluding 
a loss by 165-pound redshirt 
sophomore Logan Massa in a 
close match, Michigan won the 
last four matches to close out the 
dual meet.

Among these were three highly 

anticipated matchups. Following 
a win by 174-pound redshirt 
sophomore Myles Amine, and 
Domenic Abounader — a fifth-
year senior and the fifth-ranked 
wrestler in the 184-pound weight 
class — won his matchup against 
No. 20 Mitch Bowman by a score 
of 4-1.

Arguably the biggest result of 

the night, however, came in an 
upset win by Kevin Beazley over 
No. 5 Cash Wilcke. It was a back-
and-forth match with takedowns 
from both wrestlers throughout 
the first two periods. Ultimately, 
Beazley was able to score an 
escape in the third period and 
clinch a victory by a single point.

“I knew 197 was going to be 

really close,” McFarland said. 
“We felt we could control 174, 184 
and even heavyweight. We knew 
197 was going to be one of those 
toss-up matches. We knew it was 
going to be a great match, and I 
thought Kevin did an exceptional 
job.”

Now down by just two points, 

the Wolverines sent out their ace, 
heavyweight Adam Coon, to take 
control of the meet once and for 
all. The fifth-year senior was able 
to score a pivotal takedown early 
in the first period that proved 
too much for the third-ranked 
heavyweight in the country, Sam 
Stoll, to overcome.

The victorious finale — thanks 

to Coon — was enough to push 
Michigan over the line and leave 
Iowa City with an upset win, 19-17.

“Carver’s 
a 
hostile 

environment,” McFarland said. 
“It’s a loud crowd. It’s a tough 
place to win. But I’m proud of the 
way the guys did it. We did it the 
tough way. We did it the hard way. 
We were able to dig down deep 
and win those matches we needed 
to. It’s nice to come away with a 
win. I’m proud of the guys.”

Michigan rolls Northwestern, 80-59

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team is letting the good 
times roll.

The 
sixteenth-ranked 

Wolverines (8-2 Big Ten, 19-4 
overall), added onto what is now 
a six-game winning streak on 
Saturday, beating Northwestern 
(2-7, 9-14), 80-59. They took their 
first lead two minutes into the 
game and never gave it up.

Junior center Hallie Thome 

was the early catalyst, as Michigan 
spent the first half feeding her in 
the post. She started the game 
with two straight hook shots and 
didn’t slow down. The Wolverines 
built up a 21-9 first quarter lead 
through a cascade of spin moves, 
drop 
steps 
and 

hook 
shots, 
all 

from Thome.

By 
the 
end 

of the first half, 
Thome’s tally was 
up to 19 points on 
8-of-11 
shooting, 

more 
than 
she 

totaled 
in 
four 

of her last five 
games. The rest 
of the Wolverines 
combined for 18 in the same span.

“Her 
footwork 
was 
so 

outstanding and we were able to get 
her the ball,” Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico told MGoBlueTV. 
“And that’s something we talked 

about before the game — we need 
to establish her.”

As Thome dominated, however, 

the Wildcats managed to stay 
in the game. A Bryana Hopkins 
floater at the first quarter’s buzzer 
kept the margin at a manageable 
13 and Northwestern cut it to 10 
midway through the second.

From there, it was a familiar 

formula: an entry pass, a post-
up, a left-handed hook shot, two 
more points. Though Thome 
piled up seven more points late 
in the half doing just that, the 
Wildcats stayed within reach by 
limiting everybody else. Senior 
guard Katelynn Flaherty was the 
Wolverines’ second-leading scorer 
with seven points in the first 20 
minutes, and even that was on 
3-of-11 shooting.

In 
the 

second 
half, 

that 
changed. 

Northwestern 
started 
to 

double-team 
Thome, but the 
rest of the offense 
subsequently 
revved up.

“When 

(Thome’s) 
in 

one-on-ones, she 

can score every single time and I 
think that’s what changed things 
for us in the second half, cause 
they really had to double her,” 
Barnes Arico said. “... And then 
that opened things for our guards 

on the outside.”

Junior guard Nicole Munger 

and Flaherty began to heat up 
almost immediately. The former 
found the latter to set up a 
transition layup early in the third. 
A few possessions later, Flaherty 
hit a trademark 3-pointer from 
well beyond the arc. What had 
been a nine-point lead quickly 
turned to 15.

By the end of the third, 

Michigan led 63-47, having scored 
two more points than the Wildcats 
averaged 
per 
game 
coming 

into Sunday. Needless to say, a 
comeback wasn’t in order.

After struggling throughout the 

first half, Flaherty finished with a 
typical 27 points and six assists, 
hitting five-of-seven triples and 
kickstarting 
the 
Wolverines’ 

transition attack. This was the 
third time in her last four games 
she finished with over 25.

In addition to keeping the 

winning streak going and staying 
a game behind No. 14 Maryland 
in the Big Ten loss column, the 
victory also marked Kim Barnes 
Arico’s 
400th 
as 
Michigan’s 

head coach. In the locker room, 
the Wolverines greeted her with 
cardboard cutouts spelling out 
the milestone, as well as one of her 
own face.

“It just means I’m getting 

old,” joked Barnes Arico. “I think 
that’s what it means. But it’s nice 
that 300 and 400 weren’t that far 
away.”

Northwestern comes to Ann Arbor in desperate need of a resume boost

The history of Northwestern 

basketball operates in two 
realms: before the 2016-17 
season and after.

Prior 
to 

last 
season’s 

magical 
run, 

the 
goal 
of 

reaching 
the 
NCAA 

Tournament 
for 
the 
first 

time in school 
history 
reigned 
over 

everything. 
Success 
was 
heavily 

predicated 
on 
breaking 

through 
that 

ceiling. 

“That 
was 

as 
great 
a 

pressure as I probably ever 
have been a part of with a 
team,” 
said 
Northwestern 

coach Chris Collins at Big 
Ten Media Day. “Just with the 
media and the fan base and the 
alumni and everybody wanting 
it so bad.”

Then it happened. 
The Wildcats ripped off 

a magical run — including 
a dramatic, buzzer beating 
win over Michigan — on the 
way to an NCAA Tournament 
berth. 
Not 
stopping 
there, 

they 
topped 

Vanderbilt 
in 

the first round 
and 
nearly 

upset 
No. 
1 

seed 
Gonzaga 

in the second 
round. 
The 

loss 
couldn’t 

mitigate 
the 

most 
historic 

season 
in 

program 
history.

But expectations are merely 

a product of past success. So 
when one goal is achieved, 
it becomes a baseline for the 
future. Beyond a single NCAA 

Tournament 
appearance, 
Collins 
sought 

sustainability.

“I can tell you 

when I came to 
Northwestern, 
the 
NCAA 

Tournament was 
a goal,” Collins 
said, 
“but 
it 

wasn’t the end 
goal.”

With 
guards 
Bryant 

McIntosh and Scottie Lindsey, 

and forwards Vic Law and 
Dererk Pardon, returning for 
another season, expectations 
shot through the roof. The 
four 
veterans 

accounted for 68 
percent of the 
team’s 
scoring 

during its 2016-
17 campaign. 

The heart of 

the team — the 
“cour fore,” as 
Collins 
called 

them 
— 
that 

captivated 
the 

hearts of fans 
and national media was back. 
It seemed the most successful 

team in program history could 
only improve. 

But even from the beginning 

of the year Collins cautioned 

against 
that 

sentiment 
of 

inevitability. 
A 
long-time 

assistant 
under 
Duke 

coach 
Mike 

Krzyzewski and 
son of long-time 
NBA coach Doug 
Collins, 
the 

Wildcats’ coach 
knew 
better 

than to assume anything.

“We don’t talk about last 

year,” Collins said. “I told the 
guys, like, ‘there’s nothing 
to talk about.’ Every team 
is different. Every season is 
different. … And 
if you don’t have 
that edge, if you 
don’t have that 
chemistry, 
the 

fine line from 
winning 
and 

losing 
in 
this 

league is a very, 
very 
narrow 

margin.”

Perhaps more 

often 
than 

expected, Collins and his team 
have found themselves on the 

wrong side of that narrow 
margin. 

Northwestern 
enters 
the 

game Monday bruised and 
battered, sitting below .500 
in conference play and with a 
middling 13-9 record overall. 
Short of contending for an 
increasingly doubtful NCAA 
Tournament bid, a veteran-
laden Northwestern team is 
merely left contending for its 
pride.

While 
McIntosh, 
Pardon, 

Lindsey 
and 
Law 
have 

sustained 
their 
statistical 

success, the team as a whole 
has largely fallen flat.

Slowly but surely, though, 

the Wildcats are starting to 
play up to snuff.

Last Saturday, they avenged 

an early-season loss to Penn 
State, 
topping 
the 
Nittany 

Lions 70-61. Three days later, 
they went to Minneapolis and 
took down the Golden Gophers 
for the second time.

“There’s no room for more 

slip-ups,” Collins told media 
this past week. “We know 
there’s a lot of ball left, we 
know all the goals we had are 
still attainable.”

Any 
hope 
of 
attaining 

the 
most 
immediate 
goal 

— returning to the NCAA 
Tournament 
— 
hinges 
on 

Monday’s 
game 
at 
Crisler 

Center. 
A 
resume-boosting 

win at Michigan would send 
the Wildcats toward a frenzied 

finish 
to 
the 

season. A loss 
would 
almost 

certainly doom 
them.

And 
that’s 

the 
reality 
of 

Northwestern 
basketball 
post 
2016-17. 

There’s a new 
foundation 
for 
success, 

and close is no longer close 
enough.
