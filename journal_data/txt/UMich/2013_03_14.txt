recycle in
national

RecycleMania
competition runs
through end of March
By DANIELLE WALLICK
Daily Staff Reporter
When LSA freshman Julian Tabron
came back to Ann Arbor after spring
break, he brought back a lot more than
he took home. Along with his luggage,
he returned with multiple bags full of
recyclable materials in tow, collected
during the week at his home in Detroit.
He brought cardboard materials, plas-
tic bottles, scraps of aluminum foil and
more to compete in the University's
RecycleMania competition.
RecycleMania is a 10-week compe-
tition among more than 600 colleges
and universities across the country to
see which school can collect the largest
amount of recyclables, the least amount
of trash per capita, and have the high-
est recycling rate over the course of the
competition. The competition began on
Jan. 20 and will run until March 30.
"There are not that many places
where you can recycle in Detroit, so I
thought that I should go to the extreme
limits and keep track of things that
could be recycled in my home," said

Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder has not
appointed the emergency financial
manager for the city of Detroit, but
there has been speculation about a
frontrunner.
University alum Kevyn Orr, a part-
ner in the Jones Day law firm in Wash-
ington D.C., is, according to a report
from the Detroit Free Press, Snyder's
leading candidate for the position.
Snyder spokesperson Caleb Buhs
said it is too premature to identify
the candidates for the appointment,
since the decision to implement an
emergency manager is still under-
way. Snyder is set to announce
whether he will appoint an emer-
gency manager in a press conference

INTERNSHIPS
Students use several
University resources
to look for internships

Colleges, Career Center
and Alumni Assoc. offer
advice, services
By ALEXANDRA MONDALEK
Daily StaffReporter
The internship search process for stu-
dents has become an inescapable battle
to find the best summer opportunities.
Though each person is looking for a
unique experience, many students are
taking advantage of University resourc-
es to make their search easier and more
fruitful.
The avenues to learn more about
internship opportunities are no longer
limited to corporate website links. The
 professional networking site LinkedIn
allows prospective employees to cre-
ate professional profiles highlighting
work experience, education and skills,
while also connecting users with indus-
try management directly. Another site,
InternSushi.com, gives those trying to
break into an industry the ability to craft
an interactive digital profile through a
self-made promotions video tailored to
employers.
The University also provides students
with resources like the Career Center
and the Alumni Association to work
toward professional goals.

Hail It Forward, a networking pro-
gram run by the Alumni Association,
allows for students to connect with
Michigan graduates in their respective
industry. This resource was used widely
by students until it was recently discon-
tinued. Ayanna McConnell, the manag-
er of Student and Diversity Initiatives
of the Alumni Association, explained
that other popular resources such as
30-Minute Mentor and the Alumni
Association's LinkedIn accounts are
still available.
"Last year over 170 students partici-
pated in the three 30-Minute Mentor
programs we hosted at the Alumni Cen-
ter, and 2,250 students placed business
card orders," McConnell said. "This year
we were excited that over 200 students
participated in the LinkedIn event we
held on Feb. 11."
Though McConnell could not com-
ment directly on the discontinuation of
the Hail It Forward program, alumni
embrace the LinkedIn group and she
hopes that it will play the same role that
the Hail It Forward program once did.
"We want to help students figure out
what their brand is either online or in
person," McConnell said.
For LSA freshman Grace Hargrave-
Thomas, that brand has not yet been
developed, though she said that her lack
of professional experience has not dis-

State Rep. John Olumba (1-Detriot); Margaret Dewar, an urban planning and architecture professor; and Meagan Elliott, urban planning and
architecture graduate student, discuss the gentrification of Detroit at Weill Hall Wednesday.
Panel discusses Detroit's housing issues

State rep., Taubman
faculty offer views
on gentrification
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Daily Staff Reporter
In the last 20 years, the population
of Detroit has shrunk dramatically,
causing concern among many cities
about gentrification, which is the pro-
cess by which higher income individu-
als occupy low-income urban areas,
raising prices forcing residents to leave
their homes and relocate.

Wednesdaynight at Weill Hall, a panel
of urban planning experts and a city offi-
cial discussed the definition of gentrifica-
tion and the effects it has on Detroit.
About 60 students and faculty
attended the event, sponsored by the
Detroit Partnership, a student organi-
zation advocating education and ser-
vice in the city.
State Rep. John Olumba spoke at the
panel and discussed his experiences
representing Detroit.
Olumba said the traditional definition
of gentrification sometimes overlooks the
social factors involved in suchmovements.
"It's OK to have a hard and fast defi-
nition of(gentrification)," Olumba said.

"You should all understand that those
definitions don't always work."
At various points during the panel,
Olumba referred to gentrification as
"disenfranchisement," "injustice" and
"starvation" - demonstrating the com-
plex social, economic and political issues
involved in such a discussion. Olumba
blamed the city's government for many of
the current issues facing the metropolis.
"People arebeingstarvedofresourc-
es and there are clearly resources out
there to improve people's livelihood,"
Olumba said. "That's what I would call
gentrification - intentional moves by
the government to starve out certain

Preparing people to lead extraordinary lives

Mitch Seavey puts boots on his dog team before leaving White Mountain in Alaska during the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog
Race.
Winner of Iditarod Race 
oldest in history at 53

One year after son
wins race, Mitch
Seavy claims title
NOME, Alaska (AP) - Last
year, the youngest musher ever
to win Alaska's Iditarod Trail
Sled Dog Race said his 25-year-
old stamina gave him the advan-
tage to get his dogs to the finish
line first.
Just one year later, Dallas
Seavey's own father proved
youth doesn't always win out,
using careful strategy and an
all-out sprint to the finish line to
become the oldest winner ever
of the grueling, 1,000-mile race.
"This is for all of the gentle-
men of a certain age who think
it ends at 50, because it doesn't,"
53-year-old Mitch Seavey said
late Tuesday after cruising
across the finish line almost
three hours ahead of his son.
Youthful mushers may have
somephysical advantages - they
can do some things more easily,
such as running with their dogs
to give them a break, rather than
just sitting on the sleds, on their
way to the finish line in the old
frontier town of Nome.

But dog mushing, in fact, is
among the few extreme sports
with such a huge age range.
That's because experience takes
a long time to acquire and, more
importantly, because the true
super athletes in the game are
the dogs- a factor Dallas Seavey
is quick to acknowledge.
"The dogs can be enough,"
he said last year in an Iditarod.
com video. "There are certainly
mushers that can win the Idi-
tarod and have won the Iditarod
and never set foot off the sled.
Those are some impressive dog
teams."
Older mushers may not have
the vigor of their younger coun-
terparts, but they have more
experience and more lessons
learned from past mistakes, and
they often are better prepared to
handle things like the numbing
sleep deprivation along the trail.
In the past decade, other Idi-
tarod winners have included
Jeff King, who was 50 when he
won; John Baker, who was 48;
and Norwegian Robert Sorlie,
who was 47.
The elder Seavey, who also
won in 2004, apparently had
the best dog team this time. His
son, now 26, ended up placing

fourth, behind older competi-
tors, 43-year-old .Aly Zirkle,
who was followed by four-time
champion King, now 57. Before
this year's race, King had been
the oldest Iditarod champion
after he won in 2006 at age 50.
Also, Dallas Seavey's win at
such a young age is in some ways
unique. He grew up in the sport
in a multigenerational family,
unlike most mushers - not all
- who come to the race later,
sometimes well into middle-age.
So the experience - which
older mushers say is so crucial
to winning -was there along
with the youthful stamina when
Dallas Seavey forged ahead in
the 2012 race, beating Zirkle to
the finish line by one hour. Most
other young mushers with stel-
lar performances also come
from a mushing background.
"Last year, you had a boy who
was raised around the sport,
knew dogs from the time he was
old enough to sit in a sled," race
marshal Mark Nordman said
Wednesday.
At the end of the trail, how-
ever, mushing doesn't favor any
age, said Baker, who won the
race in 2011 and placed 21st in
this year's race.

Pope Francis speaks from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican, Wednesday. Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio
who chose the name of Francis, is the 266th pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church.
New Pope chosen, first
ever from Latin America

Jorge Bergoglio
takes name
'Francis'
VATICAN CITY (AP) -
Jorge Bergoglio of Argentina
was elected pope Wednesday,
becoming the first pontiff from
the Americas and the first from
outside Europe in more than a
millennium. He chose the name
Francis, associating himself
with the humble 13th-century
Italian preacher who lived a life
of poverty.
Looking stunned, Francis
shyly waved to the crowd of
more than 100,000 people who
packed a rain-soaked St. Peter's
Square for the announcement,
marveling that the cardinals
needed to look to "the end of the
earth" to find a bishop of Rome.
In choosing a 76-year-old
pope, the cardinals clearly
decided that they didn't need a
vigorous, young pope who would
reign for decades but rather a
seasoned, popular and humble
pastor who would draw follow-
ers to the faith and help rebuild a
church stained by scandal.
The cardinal electors over-
came deep divisions about the
future of the church to select the
266th pontiff in a remarkably
fast, five-ballot conclave.

Francis asked for prayers for
himself, and for retired Pope
Benedict XVI, whose stunning
resignation paved the way for
the conclave that brought the
first Jesuit to the papacy. Fran-
cis also spoke by phone with
Benedict after his election and
plans to see him in the coming
days, the Vatican said.
"Brothers and sisters, good
evening," Francis said to wild
cheers in his first public remarks
as pontiff from the loggia of St.
Peter's Basilica.
"You know that the work of
the conclave is to give a bishop to
Rome. It seems as if my brother
cardinals went to find him from
the end of the earth, but here
we are. Thank you for the wel-
come," he said.
In one of his first acts as pope,
Francis on Thursday morning
planned to visit Benedict at the
papal retreat in Castel Gandolfo
south of Rome.
American Cardinal Timothy
Dolan said Wednesday night at
the North American College,
the U.S. seminary in Rome, that
Francis told fellow cardinals fol-
lowing the conclave that made
him pope: "Tomorrow morning,
I'm going to visit Benedict."
The visit was significant
because Benedict's resigna-
tion has raised concerns about
potential power conflicts emerg-

ing from the peculiar situation
of having a reigning pope and a
retired one.
No such worries troubled
people in Francis' home conti-
nent.
Latin Americans burst into
tears and jubilation at news that
the region, which counts 40 per-
cent of the world's Catholics,
finally had a pope to call its own.
"It's a huge gift for all of Latin
America. We waited 20 centu-
ries. It was worth the wait," said
Jose Antonio Cruz, a Franciscan
friar at the St. Francis of Assisi
church in the colonial Old San
Juan district in Puerto Rico.
Bergoglio had reportedly fin-
ished second in the 2005 con-
clave that produced Benedict
- who last month became the
first pope to resign in 600 years.
The speed with which he was
elected pope this time around
indicates that - even though
he is 76 and has slowed down
from the effects of having a lung
removed as a teenager - he still
had the trust of cardinals to do
the job.
After announcing "Habemus
Papam" - "We have a pope!" -
a cardinal standing on the bal-
cony of St. Peter's Basilica on
Wednesday revealed the iden-
tity of the new pontiff, using his
Latin name, and announced he
would be called Francis.

Aidingfinancial aid
The University should direct donations to combat tuition costs
Last week, the Zell Family Foundation made the largest single
donation in the history of LSA. The $50 million gifted - the
third largest donation in the history of the University - will
go toward continuing the school's prestigious Master of Fine Arts Pro-
gram in Creative Writing. While this massive investment will undoubt-
edly boost the program, the donation will also serve the University as a
whole. This money will allow the University to continue to attract the
best writers from around the world while cultivating liberal arts, an
area that has been the target of funding cuts across the country. But as
the University continues to receive large donations, it's critical that the
funds be directed towards not just programs and building renovations,
but also financial aid to students.

a
I

In the past two decades, the University has
been fortunate to see its massive endowment
grow by almost 20 percent, one of the fastest
rates for any university in the United States.
This growth is due to a plethora of substan-
tial donations allocated to various schools,
departments and programs at the University.
In 2004, Stephen M. Ross, a University alum
and real estate mogul, donated $100 million
to build the new Business School, while A.
Alfred Taubman, another alum and devel-
oper, has donated more than $140 million
in various ways, including a 2011 gift of $56
million for medical research. Considering
the history of large donations from wealthy
alumni, along with the potential for massive
gifts from others down the road, the Universi-
ty will likely continue to receive huge checks
for programs, departments and research.
Therisingcostoftuition atthe Universityhas
made financial aid more important in allowing
for the best and most diverse groups of students
on campus. The vast majority of large dona-
tions go to particular programs, funding the
construction of new buildings, research, schol-
arships and teaching, among other areas. These
donations are a great addition to the University.
However, without financial aid that keeps up
with tuition rate increases, fewer qualified and
diverse groups of students will have access to
these amazing facilities and instructors.

While campaigning for regent last fall, Uni-
versity Regent Mark Bernstein suggested cre-
ating a stipulation for all University donations,
where a small percentage is required to go
directly to financial aid. The University's Board
of Regents should work on moving this plan
forward. By requiring a small percentage of a
donation to go directly to aid - likely between
1 and 5 percent - the school would drastically
increase funds for students in need of assis-
tance. Expanding on Bernstein's idea, the Uni-
versity could also add an option for a higher
percentage of the donation to go to financial aid
if the donor chooses. Not only would the school
automatically increase its funds for deserv-
ing students, but donors who might not have
considered giving to student aid would now be
directing donations to an area that offers an
incalculable benefit to campus.
Last week, University President Mary Sue
Coleman said the University's next capital
campaign would redirect the school's financial
focus from renovations to providing financial
relief to students through an increase in aid.
This shift in attention is well-directed and
much needed. While the outpouring of finan-
cial contributions continues to improve specific
schools, programs and facilities that boost the
University's reputation, donors and the Univer-
sity should consider financial aid to be a priority
when directing the use of funds.

Note to sel (and others likeme)

This week, students at the University can
make a difference for our campus and the
world. On Thursday, hundreds of students
will gather for Dive in and hear from expert
speakers, such as prominent environmental
activist Bill McKibben. The event is hosted by
the Divest and Invest Campaign at the Uni-
versity, one of 256 fossil-fuel divestment cam-
paigns nationwide. Our coalition of students,
faculty and alumni aims to align the invest-
ment activities of the University with its sus-
tainability mission and ethical responsibility
as a public institution. We plan to work with
the University to remove all endowment
money invested in fossil-fuel-industry stocks,
bonds and other financial assets - invest-
ments that directly finance the acceleration
of climate change.
From Hurricane Sandy to Midwestern
droughts, people across the country have been
waking up to the realities of climate change.
Yet, companies keep finding and extracting
more fossil fuels that release greenhouse gases
into our atmosphere while simultaneously
blocking any federal or state action to address
the climate crisis.
On an international level, the Global
Humanitarian Forum estimates more than
300,000 deaths were linked to climate change
in 2009 and 99 percent of them were in devel-
oping countries thatccontributed only1 percent
to global emissions. If we don't take significant
action, this number will grow exponentially.
To avoid the worst-case climate-change
scenarios, the majority of scientists agree that
the global average temperature cannot rise
more than two degrees Celsius, relative to
pre-industrial temperatures. We've already
allowed a rise of 0.8 degrees, and without
immediate action, we will hit two degrees in
20 to 30 years.
Now is the time to ask, "How can I help?"
The truth is, although important, individual
action isn't enough when facing this threat to
our existence. Effectively combating climate
change means putting the brakes on fossil
fuel companies. To avoid drastically alter-
ing our climate, we must stop these compa-
nies from burning 80 percent of their energy
reserves. Such a feat can only happen through

legislative and regulatory action at federal
and state levels.
The University's massive endowment
funds facilitate the fossil fuel industry's grip
on an unsustainable system that is destroying
the climate. The University is a significant
contributor to the field of climate science, yet -
we have at least $900 million invested in the
fossil fuel industry. These investments repre-
sent more than 284-billion tons of fossil fuel
reserves, out of the only 495 tons left to burn
before reaching the two-degree warming
limit. This continued investment in the fossil
fuel industry is antithetical to the core mis-
sions of the University.
Our goals are trifold: We ask the Univer-
sity to disclose all current investments in the
fossil fuel industry, while immediately freez-
ing new ones; divest from ownership in fos-
sil fuel industry public and private financial
securities within five years; and finally, invest
a substantial portion of such funds in socially,
environmentally and economically respon-
sible companies.
The idea behind divestment is not to bank-
rupt fossil fuel companies - even if all uni-
versities divested, the industry would still
be one of the wealthiest worldwide. Rather,
divestment campaigns seek to generate a
national shift in attitude toward fossil fuels,
and we hope to do so by shining the spotlight
on the harmful business model and political
clout of the fossil fuel industry. If divestment
succeeds, politicians may stop accepting
money from fossil fuel companies and start
casting votes in favor of our planet.
As Bill McKibben states, "If your college's
endowment portfolio has fossil-fuel stock, then
your educations are being subsidized by invest-
ments that guarantee you won't have much of
a planet on which to make use of your degree."
Make sure to visit divestUM.org and sign
the petition, and come to the Dive In event
on Thursday, March 14 at 6 p.m. in 1040 Dana
Building. This is your chance to join the big-
gest student movement in decades - because
together, we're greater than fossil fuels.

It's all right to flee your loneli-

feel like the dimmest, most bone-

It's all right to daydream about wak-

skillet, groggily remembering the
night before - fallen bedside lamps,
gripped pillow cases. Craving close-
ness makes you vulnerable, but it
doesn't make you weak.
If you cannot squash your lone-
liness, harness it. Plenty of poems,
scripts, essays, stories and art have
been born in a lonely place. Spend
some quality time with the person
living in your brain. Knit a beer

This year there were close to
twice as many nominations than
previous years, the most in the
23-year history of the award.
Business junior Jake Levey,
another member of SHOUT, said
putting together the award has
involved fundraising the $1,000
cash prize for the recipient,
selecting the winner and is now
shifting to marketing Schreier's
last lecture through social media,
booths in Mason Hall and flyers.
Levey said he is proud to be a

The collegiate competition
started in 2001, and the Uni-

Richardson, the recycling coordi-
nator with the University's Waste
Reduction and Recycling Office,
said the campaign not only helps
get the campus community ener-
gized about waste reduction and
recycling, it also boosts aware-
ness.
"Our goals are to increase
the campus community's waste
reduction and awareness and
to get people to stop and think a
little more about their own waste
habits and how their individual
behaviors can help our efforts,"
Richardson said.

has spent recent summers as a
full-time nanny, but said that she
wants to broaden her professional
horizons.
"I don't want to be in an
internship where I'm getting
coffee all the time, but I'll do
whatever it takes to be success-
ful," Hargrave-Thomas said. "I
want to get valuable work expe-
rience professionally and in my
field."
Hargrave-Thomas said the
University's competitive envi-
ronment has motivated her to
pursue summer job options that
she wouldn't have anticipated
doing when she was in high
school.
"So many people here are doing
big things," Hargrave-Thomas.
"That environment is inspiring
me to get on the bandwagon and
do something significant. These
are the types of people I'm going
to be competing with for jobs in

the University faculty.
"It was really important for
us this year," Levey said. "We
realized that there hasn't been a
woman who has won the award
for 11 years and that is not a
representative (statistic) of the
University of Michigan and the
professors here."
Schreier is scored an average
score of 4.7 out of five -out of 166
ratings - on RateMyProfessor.

Students on the site comment-

passionate, energetic and humor-
ous lectures.
LSA freshman Ariel Shoagtook
Schreier's introductory psychol-
ogy class in fall 2012. Shoag said

when she needed assistance on a
paper for the class, Schreier was
more than willing to help despite
her numerous other obligations.
"She didn't make you feel like
you were one of 300 students,"
Shoag said. "You'd go to her office
hours once and she would recog-
nize you for the rest of the semes-
ter."
LSA freshman Erica Mindel,
who also took Schreier's class last
fall, said she is a verytalented lec-
turer.
"It seemed that she cared about
all of her students and wanted
you to do the best that you could,"
Mindel said. "She was the most
engaging (lecturer)... I was never
really bored at all."

DETROIT

effectively.
Orr - who graduated from
LSA and the Law School -
helped Chrysler through its
bankruptcy in 2009. According
to a report from The Detroit
Free Press, he spoke to both the
governor and Detroit Mayor
Dave Bing about Detroit's
finances.
Bing announced Monday
that Orr's law firm was selected
as the reconstructing counsel
for Detroit. The firm has expe-
rience in employee benefits,
municipal finance, public proj-
ects and infrastructure, public
pensions and litigation.
"The experience of the Jones
Day law firm will be a valuable
asset as we proceed with our
plan for reconstructing the City
of Detroit," Bing said in a state-
ment.
University Law Prof. John
Pottow, who specializes in
bankruptcy and commercial
law, said the law firm has a large
national presence. He added
that Orr specifically is prepared
for the emergency manager role
due to his background in corpo-
rate reorganization.
"He's used to dealing with
tough, really painful situations

that you have to do to keep a
company alive," Pottow said.
"I think that will make him,
I hope, a cool and dispassion-
ate actor in the restructuring
realm."
Appointing an out-of-state
lawyer would ensure the posi-
tion was not motivated by polit-
ical aspirations that could be
attractive to a politician seek-
ing political affluence, Pottow
said.
Although he works at a large,
national firm, he isn't a com-
plete stranger to Michigan life.
He added that since Orr has
University degrees, he holds
some "cultural affiliation" with
the state.
After Snyder signed the emer-
gency financial manager bill on
Dec. 27, a team of six members,
including Andy Dillon, the state
treasurer, has been meeting
with city officials to determine
whether Detroit is in a state of
financial emergency.
Accepting the report the
team produced, Snyder declared
financial emergency on March1.
The report revealed that Detroit
has $24 billion in long-term
liabilities and a $327-million
deficit.
The city has lost 200,000 res-
idents between 2000 and 2010,
and the population decreased
from 1.5 million to fewer than

700,000 between 1970 and 2012.
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-
Ann Arbor) .said earlier this
month that he believes the
emergency manager appoint-
ment will not be a an effective
solution for the city. He added
that most emergency manager
position holders have driven
their respective environments
further into debt.
"Obviously, it's a bad thing
for the city of Detroit," Irwin
said. "It's a great city with a
really proud history, and I think
everyone's hoping that Detroit
is able to come back and have
resurgence and be a part of the
state's future."
He added that the state
should support Detroit, rather
than punish the city for "the
effects of globalism and urban
decay."
LSA senior Rachel Jankows-
ki, chair of the University's
chapter of College Republi-
cans, said she believes an emer-
gency manager is necessary to
get Detroit "back on its feet
again."
"We need someone who is
willing to actually face the
problems that the city is actual-
ly having," Jankowski said. "We
need someone who is definitely
serious about it, is responsible
and is willing to make difficult
decisions."


are in the top half of the results
for each of the four separate cat-
egories. The University currently
holds ninth place in total pounds
of recyclables with a total of
408,355 pounds.
Richardson said in the last
eight years the University has
participated in the competition,
it generally performs similarly
to other participating Big 10
schools.
"We are always striving to
reduce our waste and recycle
more, so hopefully that will
be reflected in this year's final
results," Richardson said.
As a Planet Blue student
ambassador, part of Tabron's
responsibilities are to inform stu-
dents about RecycleMania and
other environmentally friendly
practices among students in resi-
dent halls.
"Normally, people feel like they
don't get anything out of recy-
cling," Tabron said. "(Planet Blue
is) trying to promote recycling as
it's fun to do, it's easy and not only
are (students) helping the envi-
ronment, but (they) are helping

the community by making it more
clean and safe."
Tabron believes that recycling
will become second nature for
students eventually. Until then,
however, the contest puts the
environmental responsibility into
students' conscious thoughts.
"Since it's a competition, peo-
ple want to recycle more, but usu-
ally they don't do that during the
school year," Tabron said.
Nicole Berg, a Plant Blue
ambassador coordinator with the
Graham Sustainability Institute,
said the Planet Blue ambassadors
in the residence halls throughout
campus have been handing out
information, posting flyers and
hosting events to promote the
competition.
"(RecycleMania) is a way to
show that we are the Leaders and
Best in every category, including
sustainability," Berg said.
Both Berg and Tabron believe
that there is room for improve-
ment among students on
campus, and they hope to see con-
tinued interest in the competition
through until the end.



the future."
While the University offers
resources to the entire student
population, specific schools
such as the Ross School of Busi-
ness offer alternative student
career services to help increase
student professional prepara-
tion.
Damian Zikakis, director of
career services for the Business
school, said both workforce com-
petition and industry preference
for business students have main-
tained steadiness in the last few
years.
"Students continue to be inter-
ested in finance-related roles,
investment banks and corporate
finance positions as well as con-
sulting firm opportunities," Zika-
kis said.
While Ross offers similar pro-
grams as the University's Career
Center or Alumni Association,
like networking workshops, Zika-
kis said students are being proac-
tive in making their professional
goals a reality.
"Students are doing more
preparation, more research and
more practice to earn the intern-

ships that they want," Zikakis
said.
The University's Career Center
still remains the primary resource
students can use to begin explor-
ing their professional options.
Genevieve Harclerode, the assis-
tant director at the Career Center,
said the number of unique client
users for workshops and appoint-
ments is around 18,000 per aca-
demic year, not including those
students who use online resourc-
es such as the Career Center Con-
nector.
"All employers are going to
be interested in the question of
'why are you applying to this
job' or 'what about our company
interests you' and prior experi-
ence in their field makes that a
lot more clarified for students,"
Harclerode said. "I think you
can also find ways through vol-
unteer positions, shadowing
and informational interviewing
to start to get a feel for whether
a particular field is the right
'fit.'"

HOUSING
From Page 1A
groups of people."
Olumba pointed to Daniel
Gilbert, chairman of Quicken
Loans, who moved the compa-
ny's employees to Detroit, as one
of the perpetrators of injustice in
the city, claiming the company
used confusing loan offers to
drive individuals into bankrupt-
cy. Olumba alleged that Gilbert
facilitated the purchase of large
numbers of foreclosed homes in
Detroit after the occupants were
forced out.
"Companies like Quicken
Loans came into these areas
- where people were ignorant
about mortgage practices - and
they kept mailing them over and
over and calling them," Olumba
said. "They're harassing these
people, getting them to put their
houses up for collateral - houses
that are paid off."
Margaret Dewar, a professor
of urban and regional planning,
agreed that predatory lending
practices by financial corpora-
tions led to many of the current
housing issues. These foreclo-
sures are "extremely disruptive
to the city" because they tend to
cause a cascading effect within
communities.
"You introduce plight into a
neighborhood," Dewar said inthe
panel. "Neighbors begin to lose
confidence and stop investing in
their homes, quite understand-

ably, and people begin to leave."
However, Dewar said, gen-
trification is usually indicated
by spikes in rent for low-income
communities, which has not yet
been observed in Detroit. She
pointed out that Gilbert has pri-
marily been purchasing property
downtown, not in low-income
communities.
Meagan Elliott, an Architec-
ture and Urban Planningstudent
on the panel, said the nature of
gentrification makes it hard to
define in many situations. In
complex urban environments,
many different factors can affect
population movement.
"Gentrification can mean any-
thing from pushing residents out
to segregation of populations
in the city to ... redevelopment
work," she said.
Elliott said when people move
to the city the political dis-
cussions often take on a racial'
basis, regardless of other factors
involved.
"(Gentrification) is often a
coded way of talking about race
politics and racism," Elliott said.
"Detroitisthefourth mostsegre-
gated city in the nation."
During the open discussion,
Michael Canter, an Architec-
ture and Urban Planning stu-
dent, suggested some of the
potential benefits of gentrifica-
tion for Detroit.
"Detroit can use a little bit of
gentrification ... the population
has hollowed out so much," Can-
ter said. "They need some higher

income people to move in to pay
taxes so those city services can
better be displayed through the
rest of the city."
Canter added that gentrifica-
tion and race are often analyzed
together, which can be mislead-
ing in some cases. Although race
is often seen as a factor in gentri-
fication, the process can occur in
any area, no matter the popula-
tion demographics.
"Gentrification is not black ver-
sus white - it's not meant to be
a racial term," Canter said. "It's
sometimes takenthat way because
of the processthatgoes on."
The city of Indianapolis,
which faced similar population
issues in the 1970s, alleviated
many of its issues through mas-
sive government consolidation.
Though Canter said this pro-
cess would not work in Detroit,
he suggested that other similar
solutions should be explored.
LSA junior Samantha
Edwards, education director of
the Detroit Partnership, said
the organization holds similar
campus education events each
semester to promote multicul-
turalism and social justice.
"We came up with the topic
of gentrification because ...
I don't feel much is known
about it within the University,"
Edwards said. "We had a nice
diverse panel that offered very
different views of gentrification,
and I think people were able to
learn and gain new perspec-
tive."

Libya's militarized youth
feed into economic woes

State funds militias
while private sector
struggles and
unemployment rises
BENGHAZI, Libya (AP) -
More than 18 months since the
end of Libya's civil war, the most
attractive job for many of the
young is still to join a militia. In
fact, just under a tenth of Libya's
labor force may be working as
gunmen.
Libya's government coffers
are rapidly filling with cash as oil
exports return to near pre-war
levels, powering a 100 percent
increase in GDP in 2012, accord-
ing to a report this month by the
International Monetary Fund.
But the economy of this North
Africanoil giant remains in disar-
ray. Unemployment, officially at
15 percent, is estimated by some
as high as50 percent. The private
sector, decimated under ousted
dictator Moammar Gadhafi, still
barely functions. Reconstruction
investment is largely on hold, and
the weak central government is
funneling much of its oil wealth
into public handouts to quiet
discontent, as Gadhafi often did.
Other money is lost down the
drain of corruption.
And still other funds end up
fueling the growth of militias.
The state pays many militias,
relying on them to serve as secu-
rity forces since the police and
military remain a shambles. The
regular salary has drawn a flood
of young Libyans.
Militias first rose up as "bri-
gades" during the eight-month
civil war against Gadhafi, and
at the time their fighters likely
numbered in the thousands.
Now an estimated 200,000
people are registered by the gov-
ernment on the rolls of militias,
according to the commanders in
two of the biggest militias, Hafiz
al-Agouri, of Libya Shield, and
Ismail al-Salabi, of the Rafallah
Sahati brigade.
That would mean more than
8 percent of the country's entire
work force are in militias. The
most recent World Bank esti-

force at 2.3 million people.
A Libyan businessman and an
owner of a private construction
company that has government
contracts for rebuilding infra-
structure in the eastern region
bemoaned the lure of militia
work among his own staff.
"My very skillful welder left
because he got a job in a brigade
that would not only give him triple
the salary but he could work four
days and take a week off," Nasser
Ahdash told The Associated Press.
He said he is unable to carry out
the reconstruction work because
the price of his contracts doesn't
cover the rising costs of equip-
ment, material and labor.
Saad al-Arily, a veteran Libyan
economist, estimated that the
government spent the equivalent
of nearly $1 billion on militias in
2012. Each militiaman gets a sal-
ary ranging from $400 to $2,300
a month.
"The money spent on militias
resembles the budget of an Afri-
can country," he told AP. "Every
day a young man forms a brigade
just to get a salary."
In effect, the state pays forces
that undermine its own rule and
increase lawlessness. Militias
carry out assigned security duties
like guarding sensitive buildings,
forming security belts around
cities, or patrolling neighbor-
hoods. But otherwise, they often
act as renegades with their own
agenda. Residents complain they
run their own prisons, enforce
their own rule over neighbor-
hoods or towns, engage in kid-
nappings and extortion and spark
gunbattles with rival militias.
Some have hardline Islamist ide-
ologies and have become noto-
rious for imposing Islamic law
restrictions.
In many ways, Libya's new rul-
ers are continuing a patronage
economy that Gadhafi propagated.
During Gadhafi's 42-year rule,
the economy was solely depen-
dent on oiland gas revenues. The
state's sprawling bureaucracy
was practically the sole employ-
er, and most of the population
depended on heavy subsidies on
food and fuel and cash handouts.
Bribery and embezzlement were
common practice among govern-

sight.
Gadhafi largely wiped out the
private business class, confiscat-
ing their assets. For most of his
rule, private business was depict-
ed as exploitation and theft. At
the same time, Gadhafi used the
oil wealth to build a patronage
system, buying off tribes and
opponents with cash that was
never accounted for.
Many Libyans say that Gad-
hafi left their country with two
functioning institutions: oil and
corruption.
Continuing the patronage
style, the post-Gadhafi govern-
ment has added more govern-
ment employees. Around 1.5
million people now work for the
state in a country of 6 million
people, according to Abdel-Salam
Nassaiya, head of the budget
committee in National General
Congress. Their salaries amount-
ed to some $15 billion in 2012, a
third of the budget, up from $6
billion in 2010.
During Feb. 17 celebrations
marking the second anniversary
of the start of the anti-Gadhafi
revolution, Mohammed el-Mega-
rif, the country's leader and head
of the first elected National Gen-
eral Congress, proclaimed that a
cash gift would be given to every
citizen.
"In this glorious occasion, I
would like to inform the great
Libyan people of the generous
award," el-Megarif told a crowd
in Benghazi, where some chant-
ed, "Leave, leave. You are no dif-
ferent than Gadhafi."
After Gadhafi's fall, Libyans
saw oil revenues as the key for
transforming their economy.
Aftercomingtoanearhaltduring
the war, oil production stormed
back, reaching around 1.4 million
barrels a day in 2012. The oil min-
ister has said he expects that to
rise to 1.7 million, close to prewar
production. Oil revenues makeup
some 90 percent of the govern-
ment's income.
As a result, the government
budget in 1012 swelled to 65
billion dinars, ($53 billion) its
largest ever. A new budget has
not been approved by the parlia-
ment, which suspended its ses-
sion after coming under assaults
by militias.

president to view them from
his room and for the hundreds
of journalists broadcasting
throughout the night to the U.S.
to see the city's beauty."
City officials are also prom-
ising to escort journalists to
"important and famous histori-
cal sites." Among the spots are
the "City of David," a politically
sensitive archaeological site in
an Arab neighborhood just out-
side the Old City.
The dig, named for the bibli-
cal King David thought to have
ruled from the spot 3,000 years
ago, was conducted by Israeli
government archaeologists.
The project has generated con-
troversy because it was funded
by a nationalist Jewish group
that buys up properties in Arab
neighborhoods of east Jerusa-
lem, then moves Jewish settlers
into the homes - which critics
say is meant to make it impossi-
ble to divide the city in a future
peace deal.
Palestinians and some Israeli
archaeologists have also criti-
cized the City of David dig for
what they say is an excessive
focus on Jewish remains, and
have called into question some
of the dig's claims that attribute
ruins to the King David.
East Jerusalem, home to the
Old City and its sensitive holy
sites, was captured by Israel in
1967 and subsequently annexed
in a move that has never been
internationally recognized.
The Palestinians also claim
east Jerusalem as the capital of
their future state. Resolving the
competing claims to the area is
the most explosive issue in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Brachie Sprung, an adviser to
the mayor, said the City of David
is one of Jerusalem's most popu-
lar attractions. She rejected sug-
gestions that the free tours were
politically motivated.
"In 2012 the city of Jerusalem
experienced record breaking
tourism which boosted eco-
nomic growth, benefitting all
segments of the population,"
Sprung said in an email.
After spending the first day of
his visit next Wednesday with
Israeli officials, Obama is sched-
uled to journeyto the West Bank
the following day for talks with
the Palestinians.
But Israel's Government
Press Office says journalists
need not make the trip, which
involves crossing through a
military checkpoint. It said a
special media center in Jerusa-
lem will provide a live feed of
Obama's meeting with Palestin-
ian President Mahmoud Abbas
"in order to obviate the need to
travel back-and-forth to the Pal-
estinian Authority areas."
GPO Director Nitzan Chen
said the live feed was meant
solely for convenience. "We are
not encouraging people to go
or not" to go to the West Bank,
Chen said.
The Palestinians, mean-
while, are intent on showing the
president what life is like under
Israeli occupation. Abbas leads a
self-rule government that enjoys
limited autonomy in the West
Bank. But Israel wields overall
control of the area, which the
Palestinians claim as the heart-
land of their future state.
Palestinian officials said they
have notified American officials

that they want Obama to meet
the family of a Palestinian pris-
oner held in Israel. The Palestin-
ians said the U.S. hasn't replied.

Rag-tag Michigan
shines at Nationals

By MATT SLOVIN
ManagingEditor
Sophomore forward Andrew
Sinelli quickly ducked through
the on-ice door at Yost Ice Arena
after practice on
Wednesday. NOTEBOOK
At the blue
line stood Jacob Trouba, named
to the CCHA All-Conference team
earlier in the day. If Sinelli didn't
step off the rink fast, he'd be in
the path of one of Trouba's signa-
ture slapshots. Forgive Sinelli if he
didn't want to be on the wrong end
of a Trouba laser.
Earlier this week, Michigan
hockey coach Red Berenson
expressed surprise at freshman
forward Boo Nieves's omission
from the CCHA's all-rookie team.
Trouba's inclusion on the all-
league list surprised, well, no one.
"As he should be," said junior
defenseman Mac Bennett, when
told of his defensive partner's
accolade.
Added Berenson: "I think
Jacob's had a strong year right
from the start. When you're a
freshman, you have to have an
impact season to be selected
for that level. And good for him
because there aren't many fresh-
men.
"He did it on a team that maybe
didn't impress people for most of
the year."
Trouba received eight first-
place votes, the most for any
freshman, and 43 total votes,
good for third overall. The only
other freshman on the first team
is Miami (Ohio) forward Riley
Barber.
Berenson believes that Trouba
and Bennett form the best defen-
sive pairing to play for Michigan

Freshman defenseman Jacob Trouba was a top-10 pick in last year's NHL draft.

in quite some time. They began
skating together against Notre
Dame in February, and though
the results weren't immediate,
the team is currently riding a six-
game unbeaten streak thanks, in
part, to its solid defense.
"We're getting good consisten-
cy from our defense," Berenson
said. "As good as Jacob is, and as
good as Mac is, you need a good
partner. Ironically, the player that
Mac played with last year (then-
senior Greg Pateryn) is playing for
the MontrealCanadiens (Wednes-
day) sothat justshows you that it's
good to have a good partner."
According to Bennett, what
makes the duo so special is their
off-ice friendship.
"I think that really makes a
huge difference in terms of chem-
istry," Bennett said. "I can laugh
with that guy, I can joke with that
guy, but at the same time, I know
he's got my back no matter what.
And I think that makes a differ-
ence when it comes to game time."
Berenson said that, though the
program has had its share of high-
profile freshmen in the past, "very
few" have lived up to the lofty

expectations that Trouba faced
coming into Ann Arbor.
"He's a first rounder, a top-10
pick (in the NHL Draft)," Ben-
nett said. "Obviously there's a lot
of hype that he had to live up to,
and he did it. There's a reason he's
drafted so high. He's just a really
solid, skilled - can be a shut-down-
guy, can be a physical guy, can be
an offensive guy - there's a little
bit of everything.
"He's a very special part of this
team."
PARKER HANGS'EM UP: When
legendary Boston University
coach Jack Parker announced his
retirement Monday after 40 sea-
sons at the helm, it meant Beren-
son could add another distinction
to his laundry list of them.
Berenson is now tied for the
longest-tenured coach in col-
lege hockey with Gary Wright of
American International. They've
been at their respective programs
for 29 years.
"I look up to (Parker) because
he was a college coach for a long
time before I came here," Beren-
son said. "It was a very respectful
relationship."

The Michigan ski team isn't
a varsity or club sport. In fact,
it isn't actually recognized as
a team on campus at all. The
"team" doesn't have coaches or
train regularly, it isn't funded or
sponsored bythe University and
its members aren't recruited.
So when the men's alpine
team placed second at the Mid-
west Regional Qualifier in Feb-
ruary, the skiers were surprised
and thrilled to have earned
a position at the U.S. Colle-
giate Skiing and Snowboarding
National Championships.
The team was an underdog in
every event when it traveled to
Sun Valley, Idaho, to participate
in the championship, and no one
was expecting to place. So when
Michigan earned third place in
the slalom and seventh overall,
the Wolverines shocked their
competition and themselves.
"(Slalom) was substantially
longer than what we've ran all
year and substantially harder,"
said freshman All-American
Kane Boynton. "We really had
no expectations going in. We
were just out there to have a
good time and have a lot of fun."
Six Michigan skiers and one
female snowboarder were cho-
sen to compete in Idaho. The
difference in conditions at Sun
Valley compared to the courses
the team raced at this season
was incredibly overwhelming.
"The longest course we ran
this whole year in the Midwest
was 25 seconds, and then we got
out there and the course was a

Michigan faces Penn State in first round of Big Ten Tournament

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor
As multiple chances to control
its destiny were wasted and an
opportunity to win a share of the
Big Ten title slowly fell off the rim
at Crisler Center on Sunday, the
Michigan men's basketball team
is headed to Chicago a day earlier
than expected.
The sixth-ranked Wolverines
(12-6 Big Ten, 25-6 overall) fin-
ished fifth in the conference with
their loss to Indiana, meaning
they'll have to win four games
in four days to claim the Big Ten
Tournament title.
And that road runs straight
through teams that Michigan has
struggled with all season: Penn
State, Wisconsin and Indiana.
Fifth-seeded Michigan faces
12th-seeded Penn State (2-16,
10-20) in Thursday's second game
- the third time the Wolverines
have faced the Nittany Lions
since Feb. 17 and the first time
since Penn State upset Michigan
in State College two weeks ago.

The good in running away

0


I don't think I've been this content in my life. Not happy, not excited -
but content. You know: Like butter running through your veins is how I
feel. I ate both a reuben and a BBQ chicken sandwich.
Well, OK, also this cookie and a black-cherry soda. Oh, man, this cook-
ie. There were these squishy raisins, and it was so soft and the cinnamon
was just like ughhhhhh. It was at this point when I ate the cookie, before
the sandwiches came, my muscles started twitching and, to be complete-
ly honest, they haven't stopped since. My thigh has been spazzing for 20
minutes.
So, anyway, I ate the sandwiches and, oh my God. I tackled the reuben
with a tiger-like force, and this roast beef was swimming in my stomach
- I mean seriously magical. It was like magma flowing in slow motion.
I thought I was full, and then I saw the #85 and I knew S wasn't done. I
destroyed this thing. This chicken - the BBQ was dancing like a fucking
madman all over my mouth - was just so tender and wow.
Plus, this black-cherry cola is literally the equivalent of God water.
Yes. God water. So, basically, if you find yourself in a mind-warping,
neck-snapping, hungry-hungry-hippo pot high, I highly (see the pun?)
recommend Zingerman's. My thigh is still twitching.
- DAILY ARTS WRITER
"Hi, please help me," I desperately exclaimed, bracing my wobbling body
between shelves of bread and vinegar and brightly colored walls. "I called ear-
lier to order, and I don't know where to go or what I'm supposed to be doing
right now."
Because Zingerman's was big- bigger than IShad remembered - its dizzy-
ing number of aisles, rooms and sandwich options flooded my senses like the
Blue Moons I downed an hour or so before.
Fortunately, however, help was immediately on its way: Within seconds, I
was rescued by a perky employee who took my arm, walked me through the
restaurant and told me how to buy my food. I was grateful for the hospitality
and, after dousing her in blearythank yous and apologies ("Please don't judge
me, I swear I'm not usually like this") I stumbled outside and fell into a patio
chair with my sandwich-packed paper bag.
Joy washed over me. It was finally time. I couldn't remember what I
ordered, but those details weren't important: As I pulled away the paper
wrapping, I knew I was holding a specimen of deli perfection. Puffy bread.
Pale, melty cheese. Enough spicy honey mustard to cut through my sinuses
and tequila-tinted breath. A thick, pillowy pile of turkey that spilled out in
meaty folds all over the table.
"I'm going to eat all of this," I announced to anyone who was listening.
The next few minutes were a messy blur of mustard, crumpled napkins and
pure jubilation. I obliterated my meal in as few bites as possible, careful to not
to miss any scraps of Challah or deli meat that might have fallen in the pro-
cess. It didn't matter that IShad paid over $10 for a four-ingredient sandwich
or that I was sitting outside in a frigid, metal chair - it was the best damn
sandwich IShad tasted, and if the restaurant hadn't closed a few minutes into
my outdoor feast, ISprobably would've sloshed back inside to order another.
-CHLOE STACHOWIAK
I walk into Zingerman's on a sunny Wednesday afternoon without a hint
of mind alteration. Decaf coffee, ahealthy butsensibly sized breakfast - I've
even had a good night's sleep. In other words, I could not feel more average.
It's been a few years since I've paid the famed delicatessen a visit, but my
memory of the market/restaurant's layout is more or less accurate. Cheeses
to the left, breads and the like at 4 o'clock and a sneaky passage enshrined in
coffees, oils, vinegars and other exotic delicacies.
Because I'm able to trust my unchanged perception, it's relatively easy to
avoid other customers and place an order with the friendly and ever-helpful
staff manning the sandwich station. I order a chicken, bacon and ranch,
and my friend orders a Detroit-style BBQ chicken sandwich. I immediately
regret my decision, but because I'm not brazen or drunk enough to ask for a
change, IStake my seat and accept my fate.
The sandwich is tasty - a little dry and a little expensive, but I'm defi-
nitely glad I decided to come here. The bacon is peppery and crispy, and
combined with the chickenbreast and creamy ranch dressing, I wolf down a
half before I realize what I've done. But since I'm not under the influence of
any hunger-inducing substances, I decide that the other wedge would make
a tasty snack later, and I get it wrapped to go (however, my friend receives
bakedbeans cooked with bacon, and I happily volunteer to help finish them).
I leave Zingerman's feeling pretty happy overall. True, it did cost about
$30 for a lunch for two, but it's rare to find such a carefully-crafted lunch
with such quality ingredients. And, forgoing the morning joint/Jack Dan-
iels, I'm ultimately happiest that I didn't waste $30 on a meal I'd barely
remember.
-ELLIOT ALPERN

By LOUIS MARINARO
Besttobeginthis storywith an
explanation about the prevailing
attitude andbeliefthatcorporal
punishment was good for the
child and encouraged in our com-
munity. Punishment was meted
out with some glee in the parochi-
al school systemin the earlyl1960s
in Philadelphia. The preferred
weapon of choice? A three-foot
wooden ruler, and for tougher
hides, the half-inch maple pointer.
Both instruments were employed
on a regular basis, especially on
boys who had a propensity for
wildness.
As a young boy growing up in
a practicing Catholic household,
it was assumed that we would all
attend Catholic school. I, like all of
my Italian-American neighbors,
was part of the Stella Maris parish
in south Philadelphia.
I had spent a total ofnine years
in Catholic school, and it was
beginning to wear very thin on my
gluteus and hands, not to mention
my pride. By the eighth grade,
my reputation as a troubled and
troublemaking student was well
known. As the sisters of the Saint
Joseph order so delicately putit, "I
would grow up tobe a wife beater
and a criminal."
The details of my mistake
involve two other classmates,
Nick Del Asandro and Richie
Crowbar. The three of us had the
dubious distinction of spending
most of our first semester in grade
eight standing in the back of the
classroom, a form of detention for
not completing our homework.
The problem with detention was
that it gave us an opportunity
to spend time with one another,
size each other up and eventually
decide that not doing homework
was the easiest way to be sent to
the back of the room and goof
off. After a few weeks of our plot-
ting and goofing off, Sister Mary
Catherine Marie got wise to our
scheming and decided to include
some severe corporal punishment

in addition to our standing deten-
tions.
We had had enough. The past
nine years had been a constant,
unwinnable battle and we wanted
a way out. Bishop Neuman High
School, an all boys' Catholic
school, was looming on the hori-
zon, and no pleading with our
parents was goingto getus out of
that inevitability, which would
undoubtedly be an extension of
the torture. Rumors on the street
had made us wise to the fact that
corporal punishment in Bishop
Neuman High School was meted
out not bythe sisters of St. Joseph,
but by the brothers and priests,
who weren't afraid to dole out a
much heftier class of punishment.
Our parents turned down our
repeated requests to transfer us
to the local public school. Even if
it was peopledby the "unclean"
non-Catholics of the neighbor-
hood, we were willing to take our
chances. Left with no alternative,
we decided that we were going to
run away. Our plan was simple. No
notes were to be left announcing
our departure. We would pre-
tend to go to school and pack our
school bags with food and cloth-
ing. We left one morning headed
for League Island Park at the most
southern end of the city. Atthe
edge of the park was the train yard
for the Philadelphia waterfront.
Our plan was to hop a freight train
and be out of townbefore anyone
was the wiser.
It was a cold morning, and

we built a small fire in a wooded
area next to thetrain yard while
waiting to begin our journey.
We didn't know where we were
going, butwe were getting out of
Catholic school one way or the
other. What we didn't know was
that the school had called our
parents to inquire as to why three
boys from Sister Mary Catherine
Marie's class weren't in school. By
11 a.m. that morning, there was
a citywide search on for three
missing children. Our camp was
discovered around noon, but we
managed to escape the first set
of police officers thatwere dis-
patched. We weren't so lucky with
the second, larger contingent. We
were arrested and brought to the
local police station. We were sur-
prised to find our parents waiting,
looks of worry plastered across
their face.
Though at the time this was an
incredibly difficulteventfor my
parents and I to get through, being
expelled from Catholic school
allowed me to meet many great
teachers in the public-school sys-
tem. These teachers were instru-
mental in changing my behavior
and ultimatelythe direction of my
life. The sculptor Iam today in
large part is directly a result of my
expulsion from parochial school. I
can sayI am proud of the mistake
I made.

ZINGERMAN'S
From Page 1A
Zingerman's has achieved
extraordinary success, but
instead of keeping their formula
to themselves, they share it freely.
Weinzweig has written several
books about effective manage-
ment. ZingTrain offers consult-
ing on the art of customer service.
BAKE!, a hands-on teaching bak-
ery shares the secrets of Zinger-
man's most delectable breads and
pastries with over 60 different
courses.
School of Music, Theatre &
Dance sophomore Heather Ken-
drick has worked for Zingerman's
for two years and has taken three
of the BAKE! courses.
"It's super fun, and it's really
worth your dollar because you
end up leaving with so many
things you make," Kendrick said.
"I took a donut-making class - my
mom and my sister and I took it
together, and we ended up with
160 donuts!"
Though firmly rooted in Ann
Arbor, Zingerman's has a mail-
order program that extends the
business's reach to the entire Unit-
ed States. In 1994, Mo Frechette
became a founding partner of the
mail order, which now rivals the
deli in terms ofsales volume. When
Frechette was first startingout, his
business was a curiosity inthe food
world.
"There was no food mail-order
business industry; there were
no television shows about food;
there were no blogs about food,"
Frechette said. "It wasn't com-
mon for people to have an interest
in food, or to have that as a pas-
sion."
Another passion of the Zinger-
man's gang is travel. Frechette and
the other Zingerman's partners go
on epic adventures, sort of culi-
naryvision quests, to find the ideal
foods for their businesses.
"Ifyou travel with me, I'm going
to drag you to a grocery store,"
Frechette said. "It's my museum."
On a whirlwind tour through
Spain, from Bilbao to San Sebas-
tian, Frechette spent hours perus-
ing the grocery stores' seafood
aisles.
"You consider tinned seafood
to be a low-end commodity,"
Frechette said. "They treat it like
a great and amazing thing. Things
you'd never think would be in a tin

Zingerman's offers a customer service training program called ZingTrain that teaches their effective management strategies.

can be found there - barnacles off
the side of a boat, for instance."
After these journeys, employees
share their finds with the rest of
the discerning staff. On an aver-
age month, Zingerman's employ-
ees will taste 200 foods and maybe
two will be considered worthy
additions tothe menu.
"What's considered mundane in
one place and sold in a gas station
is sometimes special somewhere
else," Weinzweig said. "Almost
everything we sell is poor people's
food, but if you're not from the
area where it's produced, it seems
exotic."
The haters are out there
Another partner with a global
perspective is the Bakehouse.
For 20 years, Frank Carollo and
his staff have hand-crafted every
hearth-baked loaf. They've also
scouredthe globe in search of new
recipes.
Since 2011, members of the
Bakehouse staff have traveled to
Hungary three times to eat and
to learn traditional artisan bread
baking. The bakers brought their
experiences back with them, sell-
ing Hungarian torts, breads and
soups in the Bakehouse shop.
Zingerman's also offers Hungar-
ian baking classes. As Carollo put
it, "We want our customers to
learn with us."
Weinzweig has a unique busi-
ness philosophy, which may have
been a catalyst for Zingerman's
success. As a Russian history
major, his focus was on the anar-

has shaped his managerial style
and noted that there are striking
similarities between hundred-
year-old anarchist writings and
modern progressive business
books.
"Except one group was going to
jail and one was on the best-seller
list," Weinzweigsaidwithalaugh.
Weinzweig's anarchist utopia
stresses free choice and respect
for individuals, with the belief
that a strong work ethic comes
from conviction in one's work. In
fact, Zingerman's is a place where
the employees truly run the busi-
ness.
"We wanted to push decision
down as far as in the organization
as we could, so that decisions were
not going to be made based on who
had the most authority, but who
has a good idea - who has a solu-
tion," Saginaw said.
Zingerman's has been called
"The Coolest Small Company in
America" by INC Magazine and
received high praise from celebrity
chefs Bobby Flay and Mario Batali.
But as Saginaw put it, "The hat-
ers are out there. They hate us to
the bone." These detractors take
to Internet forums bitterly moan-
ing that Zingerman's food is over-
priced, as if they'd been tricked
into ordering a $12 sandwich.
After AnnArbor.com published
a story about Bobby Flay tweeting
from Zingerman's, user "Goober"
griped: "He has the moneyto eat at
Zingerman's."
Saginaw was quick to admit that
Zingerman's isn't a necessity.
"Nobody gets up and says, 'If
I don't get an $8 loaf of bread, life
isn't worth living.' We don't sell
anything that anybody needs,"
Saginaw said.
Despite the naysayers, Zing-
erman's has flourished by offer-
ing traditional, full-flavored food
whose production value explains
the price tag. The specialty ingre-
dients are imported; Saginaw
noted that by definition you can
onlyget parmigiano reggiano from
Italy.
Being a good corporate citizen
However, many of the ingredi-
ents in Zingerman's goodies are
grown with pride in Michigan.
"I believe that the local busi-
ness is the backbone of the eco-
nomic system," Saginaw said. "It
is what will drive it and help cre-
ate vibrance."
"You earn your right to do
business in a community by
being a good corporate citizen,"
Saginaw added. "You need to be
profitable but you need to make a
profit responsibly and share that

responsibly with the people you
work with and the community
from which that profit comes."
Saginaw tries to support the
Ann Arbor community by buy-
ing locally whenever possible
and through other philanthropic
endeavors. After taking stock of
the rampant waste in the food
industry he founded Food Gather-
ers, a hunger relief organization.
"The reality is that a line cook
after working 12 hours isn't driv-
ing across town to look for home-
less people," Weinzweig said.
That's where Food Gatherers
comes in. The organization liber-
ates perfectly good leftovers that
would otherwise end up in trash
heaps from local restaurants and
distributes them to community
kitchens.
Weinzweig added, "For some-
body who is in need of a nutri-
tious meal, it's totally healthy, but
maybe it wasn't as tasty as the res-
taurant wanted."
In a time when many busi-
nesses are struggling to stay open,
Zingerman's is already planning
its business strategy for the com-
ing decade.
The plan states that Zinger-
man's will run up to 18 indepen-
dent businesses by the year 2020.
A Tunisian restaurant is already
in the works.
"We've been selling many
Tunisian products that come from
one family, and we've become
very close with the family," Sagi-
naw said. "They are consulting
on this, and the two employees
who are interested in doing this
have stayed with the family and
learned from them."
Always the overachievers,
Zingerman's bought a herd of
Tunisian sheep in order to serve
a very specific type of Tunisian
lamb in the restaurant.
From a tiny delicatessen with
four employees, Zingerman's
has grown to a nationally known
enterprise. They will end this fis-
cal year with $47 million in sales,
18 partners, eight businesses and
about 600 employees.
Though their official birthday
is March 15, Zingerman's will
commemorate over three decades
of service, philanthropy and culi-
nary exploration with an evening
entitled "Celebrating 31 Years
with Ari," on April 3.
The event will highlight the
deli's history and provide a tanta-
lizing glimpse of things to come.
"It'll be a lot of good food and
probably some of the things that
I'm excited about moving for-
ward," Weinzweig said. "A little
past, a little present and a little
future."

Dostoevsky.
His existen-
tial treatment of Christianity
served to guide me through
what was then my vague, liberal
Protestantism. In "Dostoevsky,"
Berdyaev articulated what he
thought were the main themes
of Dostoevsky's work, and I con-
sumed the book quickly.
Unlike many, that was howI
spent my freshman year's wel-
come week. I don't know exactly
how I would view the book and
its ideas today - Ithave yet to
reread it - but what I won't ever
forget was that rush of excite-
ment I experienced when I
thought I had found the book I
needed to be reading at this time
in my life.
I love browsing bookstores.
The prospect of findingwhat
you didn't set out to find, of
coming across the unexpected,
provides me with a secret thrill.
This past summer, I experienced
that rush of excitement again.
I sat down in one of the chairs
at Dawn Treader, and when I
looked in front of me at the shelf,
there sat "The Rise of Eurocen-
trism: Anatomy of Interpreta-
tion" by Vassilis Lambropoulos,
a professor at the University. I
don't know why this book was
there (especially a practically
new hardcover copy), but it was.
For many reasons, it seemed as
if this was the book I needed to
read. I hadn't heard of it, nor
had Iever really looked at that
shelf before, the one where gen-
eral history meets conspiracy
theory books.
At the time, I didn't have the
sufficient background to fully
understand what it discussed,
and while I probably still won't
understand all the references
ranging from the Reformation
to Derrida, that excitement
rushed over me. Having just
come out of a course on Samuel
Beckett, and in a crisis over the
question of interpretation, this
booked seemed to offer some
light.
Obviously, there are plenty
of other opportunities by which
I could have attempted to
reconcile my anxieties about
interpretation; feel free to write
me off as a mystic for defend-
ing this one. There's definitely
room for that interpretation. Or
call ita gambler's addiction, if

you fancy. Nevertheless, I cher-
ish the experience of walking
into an old bookstore and let-
ting my mind wander. For this
reason, I find myself sensitive
to the possibility of losing this
experience.
Businesses come and go
in Ann Arbor; every student
has a different memory of the
city. The welcoming signs of
old State Street businesses
hung overhead my Freshman
year while construction work-
ers busily reminded us that
things were changing. During
my experiences in Ann Arbor,
bookstores seem to have been
most affected. I never got a
chance to check out the famous
Shaman Drum; I only ever saw
the sign hanging above the
door leading into its gutted-out
insides. Borders and Dave's
Books, two bookstores close to
campus, closed within my first
year in Ann Arbor. These places
I went to during my freshman
year no longer existed by the
end.
Let the book
find you.
So I'm a mystic, and now you
have the opportunity to call me
a luddite or a cultural conserva-
tive after the following: Part of
me laments what the Internet
has done to browsing culture.
Looming in the background, the
cheaper alternative of Amazon
ruins the browsing culture
experience. Now I buy books
because I've been told I need
them. Chance encounters with
new knowledge no longer slip
through the cracks; my life and
my readings now all have a pur-
pose and isn't it wonderful?
Certainly Amazon and other
sites have chipped away at
these bookstore's profits. No
one would deny that. I don't
know if this column makes a
good enough case, butI really
encourage those reading to look
at next semester's reading lists
and head over to Dawn Treader,
West End Books and Common
Language among others and see
if they have the book you need.
Who knows - they might! And
I make this argument especially
today because we have coming
to our community a new book-
store, Literati. True,the book-
store sits a little bit off campus,
but the trek out there would
really make a difference.
And even if you don't have a
particular book in mind, check
it out anyway. You'll never know
what you didn't know unless you
step in and see.

continued to grow, the demand "Being a pastry chef is all about
for classes became apparent. Six multitasking," she confided as she

navigated a stirring spoon with
wild, prancing hands. Lohmann
demonstrated stirring technique
for the cream pastry, our first
task. Then, we students dove in.
Across the room, spatulas
clunked. Eggshells crackled. In
front of us lay shiny pots, stir-
ring spoons, pats of butter in wax
paper and Tupperware cups of
sugar, salt, flour, eggs and vanilla
bean. Everything smelled like
butter. Running frantically from
the stove back to my chair with a
saucepan, my muscles trembled.
Cooking equaled exercise. I was
sweating for these cream puffs.
Furtively, ISglanced at my peers,
strainingto peer inside their pans.
Was I falling behind? Was I doing
okay? Could everybody see the
sweat stains draped beneath my
armpits? Cheryl smiled at me and
glanced nonchalantly into my pot.
"Lookin' great!" she enthused as
she whisked her bowl with wiry,
done-this-before flair.
According to Emberling, stu-
dents aren't arranged in class by
baking talent. In fact, newcom-
ers and oldtimers alike are placed
together. This is due to the BAKE!
mission, which focuses on culti-
vating teachable material, rather
than skills.
"What we're trying to do in
each class is teach technique,
and it is the case that everyone
who comes may be at a differ-
ent level, but the basic info you
need to share can be the same,"
Emberling said. "There's often
not advanced knowledge. There's
advanced practice. But the knowl-
edge is the same."
Despite four hours of instruc-
tion, I never felt weary with any
task. In fact, my intimidation
wore off as Lohmann routinely
cycled our tables to check on our
progress. In between the chat-
ter of my peers, the hiss of cream
sauce on the stove and croon of
jazz on the stereo, I fell into rou-
tine. Lohmann demonstrated,
then students tried. The pastry
dough was kneaded, baked and
puffed. The cream was piped -
squeezed through plastic, trian-
gular bags in order to create afros
of lush, swirly cream. Eclairs
were garnished with powdered
sugar. The whipped cream was
whipped.
"Although we want (these
classes) to be full of content, we
want them to also be relaxed,
enjoyable and fun, so it's a safe
learning environment, and not
like the things you see on TV -
not like the scary chef," Ember-
ling noted.

Surprisingly, as the class wore
on, I wasn't sensing an ounce of
Scary Chef from Lohmann, nor
from the other students. True,
I splashed some of the cream
sauce out onto the stove, almost
hitting the baker next to me (she
flinched). And, yes, my cream
puffs were the smallest of the
batch because my arms started
wheezing midway through the
piping process (to be fair, Ihad the
smallest biceps).
But ultimately, I felt pretty
badass.
When our cream puffs were
placed into a take-home box, we
all chuckled. My apron heaved
with egg yolk and vanilla bean
smudge. My face was pummeled
in a permanent hot-stove flush.
But I conquered those puffs.
Like crisp, brown jewels, they
winked inside my box. I chomped
into one, and my teeth sung. Hal-
lelujah, sugar.
For the epilogue of our class,
Lohmann demonstrated how to
make cream puff swans - adorn-
ing their wings with plushy puffs
of cream. What's more, she tout-
ed the versatility of the pastry
dough, proving its multifunction
by teaching - and serving us! -
homemade tomato-and-cream
gnocchi, citrus-glazed donuts,
cinnamon churros and my favor-
ite: cheese puffs that boogied in
my mouth with dollops of Mon-
terey Jack, cheddar, pepper and
buttery groove.
At the Bakehouse, quality ingre-
dients are used not only in the in-
house goods, but also in classes. In
fact, the origins of the ingredients
used in my class - chocolate, vanil-
la bean, eggs - were all explained
with loving passion by Lohmann,
who then gave us tips on where to
find the finest and most affordable
ingredients in Ann Arbor.
BAKE! class Principal Shelby
Kibler added that the recipes
shared in class are also the Bake-
house's very own. "When we
opened the school, it was deliber-
ately to show people how to make
what we make here, so the focus
was taking our recipes at the bak-
ery," he said.
Walking to my snow-encrusted
car, my belly bulged. In my trunk:
an entire Tupperware can of pas-
try cream, another filled with
warm chocolate ganache and,
finally, my babies - my cream
puffs, cradled in their cardboard
cribs.

"It's an WOOD
Ann Arbor - -
classic,"
I hear from every University
acquaintance. "You're not just
paying for the sandwich but for
the whole experience."
You guessed it: We're talking
Zingerman's Deli.
Now, before you call blas-
phemy, let me explain myself. I
will concede that Zingerman's
is adored by Ann Arborites and
University alumni the world
round, and that this popularity,
coupled with the restaurant's
history, rightfully dignifies it
as an Ann Arbor classic. The
sandwiches are thoughtfully
crafted, the side dishes sophis-
ticated, the decor cultured and
weird (typical Ann Arbor) and
the business model clever and,
respectable. But as a deli, I just
can't overlook the fact that their
sandwiches simply don't taste
that good.
I mean, I've had much bet-
ter pastrami. Here it's dry - an
unforgivable fault, severely
lacking in salt (Hello, this is
supposed to be brined?), truly
underseasoned and, on the
whole, bland. The expanse sep-
arating the superior pastrami
at Katz's in New York City from
the inferior at Zingerman's Deli
here in Ann Arbor is inarticu-
lately vast. And, as the cherry
on top, Katz's Manhattan deli is
still cheaper.
I've never found the breads
particularly exquisite, either.
Zingerman's "best-selling" Jew-
ish rye is too dense for my taste,
lacking a satisfying texture,
deep color and any unique char-
acter ... save the crusty, grilled
edges, which require at least a
minute of forceful chomping on
before disintegrating into a con-
sistency capable of being swal-
lowed without puncturing your
esophagus. My jaw has gotten
a more facile workout from a
softball-sized jawbreaker (you
know, the kind you break your
teeth on).
Any bread here given a gener-
ic, unrevealing name is simply
that: generic. I'm talking to you,
"farm bread" (overcooked white
bread), "soft buns" (glorified
hot dog buns), "Country Wheat
bread" (let's just call it wheat
bread) and "Bakehouse white
bread" (the extra adjective does
little to distinguish this loaf
from Wonder).
The pickles accompanying
the sandwiches are an atrocity,
too. Why anyone would ever
serve an "old pickle" - yes,
that's what they call it - is
beyond me. They taste just as
their name implies.

But aside from the sandwich-
es and pickles, I must admit that
nearly everything else is really
quite delicious. The spinach feta
salad is simple, light, tangy and
- with a hint of mint - subtly
refreshing. The garlic potato
salad is a modern, tastytake on
the traditional German variety,
and the macaroni and cheese is
OUT. OF. THIS. WORLD. I'm
not exaggerating when I say
that this is literally the best mac
and cheese I've ever had and
probably will ever have. With
a creamy housemade bechamel
sauce, artisanal Tuscan maca-
roni and plenty of Cabot Ver-
mont cheddar and cracked black
peppercorn, a side of this hearty
mac is a must. The sauce is silky,
but not artificially so. The mac-
aroni are cooked perfectly, pro-
viding a decent cohesiveness;
the cheese is strikingly perva-
sive. The crunchy charred bits
of cheese and pasta on top add
depth of texture and flavor, and
the product's mouthcoating is
slippery smooth. I'm impressed
to the highest degree.
Take note, however, that only
one pan of macaroni and cheese
is made each day. The pan rolls
out at 11 a.m., and once it's gone,
it's gone. So get there early.
Skip the
sandwiches,
stick to the
sides.

The next-door dessert shop
boasts a variety of delectable
confectionaries, beautifully dec-
orated cakes and pastries, sweet
espresso drinks and Sicilian-
style gelato made with Michigan
milk at Zingerman's Creamery
down the road. While I don't
find the gelato exceptional, it
does cap off a Zingerman's meal
sweetly and can be just the ticket
on a hot summer's day.
In all fairness, Zingerman's
is an experience. Everyone in
Ann Arbor should dine there a
time or two and be willing to
graciously escort interested out-
of-state guests there when they
come to visit. It's an experience
to stand wrapped around a his-
toric brick building in anticipa-
tion, sampling sides, meats and
cheeses outside the door. It's an
experience to order from the
expansive sandwich menu and
peruse the rare cheeses, expen-
sive oils and aged vinegars. It's
an experience to dine in the
crowded upstairs of the renovat-
ed house or out on the patio, and
it's an experience to sip a creamy,
red birch beer with friends and
family over a relaxed meal. Just
remember that it's actually not
about the $16 sandwiches - as
much as everyone wants you to
think that it is - as they're sim-
ply not extraordinary.
Wood is definitely not eating
at Zingerman's. To fight him,
