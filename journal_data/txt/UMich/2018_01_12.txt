University 
of 
Michigan 

Electrical 
Engineering 
and 

Computer Science courses have 
developed extensive waitlists 
due to growing enrollment 
rates, 
graduate 
students 

registering for undergraduate 
classes, and limited numbers of 
faculty — giving students stress 
about being able to complete 
their requirements on time. The 
department’s 
administration 

is working to hire more full-
time faculty and acquire larger 
lecture halls to meet the high 
demand, but have struggled to 
succeed.

Currently, 
the 
EECS 

department is comprised of 143 
faculty, 1,882 undergraduate 
students and 1,094 graduate 
students, 
high 
enrollment 

numbers that have increased 
significantly 
over 
the 
past 

decade. Seth Pettie, professor 
and associate chair of the 
electrical 
engineering 
and 

computer science department, 
confirmed the department is 
aware of the waitlist issues 

affecting 
undergraduate 

students and stated it has 
become a recent problem due to 
the program’s high demand.

“If you look at our enrollment 

numbers, they go up linearly 
and year by year,” Pettie said. 
“They have been going up for 
the last 10 years and of course 
(registration) wasn’t a problem 
10 years ago and things have 
become more acute in the last 
year.”

Just within the Computer 

Science and Engineering major 
of EECS, enrollment has grown 
exponentially within the last 
five years. According to Brian 
Noble, chair of the computer 
science 
and 
engineering 

department, the number of 
undergraduates with declared 
CSE 
majors 
has 
doubled, 

increasing from 748 in Fall 2013 
to 1,457 in Fall 2017.

The 
CSE 
undergraduate 

degrees 
granted 
has 

subsequently increased from 211 
during the 2012-2013 academic 
year to 520 during the 2016-
2017 academic year. However, 
the size of CSE faculty has not 

On Thursday evening, over 

seven hundred delegates, staff 
members and advisors gathered 
together in the University of 
Michigan’s Rackham Auditorium 
for the 31st Model United Nations 
at the University of Michigan 
Conference Opening Ceremony. 
The 
conference 
is 
run 
by 

University undergraduates, and 
offers high school students from 
37 high schools across the country 
an opportunity to deepen their 
understanding of international 
affairs. The keynote speaker 
for the opening ceremony was 
University Regent Ron Weiser, 
and his speech highlighted “the 
good, the bad and the ugly” of the 
United Nations.

Weiser, who also served as the 

U.S. ambassador to Slovakia from 
2001 to 2005, began by discussing 
the history of the United Nations 
in regards to former U.S. President 
Woodrow Wilson’s “Fourteen 
Points” speech, which outlined 
the future of nations committed 
to peace during World War I. He 
also emphasized how the United 
States embodied those points as 
it helped to shape the U.N. after 
World War II.

“The United States, now under 

the leadership of FDR, returned 
to Wilson’s grand strategy — to 
a construction of a rules-based 
order in which the United States 
and other democracies would 
prosper,” Weiser said.

Weiser then discussed the 

universality present in the U.N., 

which he viewed as a double-
edged sword. He explained while 
the inclusiveness of the U.N. 
allows for actions against threats 
— such as sanctions — to be taken, 
it conversely allows countries 
unsolicited uses of the veto power.

“On a strategic level the 

U.N. poses a structural flaw of 
universality 
in 
participation 

because great powers can use 
veto (power) to barter action 
against themselves,” Weiser said. 
“For example, during the Cold 

War, the Soviet Union used the 
veto power 68 times, and the U.S. 
used it 61 times. On the other 
hand, universality is occasionally 
a significant plus, most recently 
the UN Security Council passed 
sanctions against North Korea.”

Weiser 
considered 
other 

positive aspects of the United 
Nations such as the legitimacy 
of the Security Council, the 
strength of technical agencies 
and the United Nations High 
Commissioner on Refugees’ aid 

to over 50 million refugee families 
and more. Weiser also pointed out 
many of the flaws that he viewed as 
the negative elements of the U.N. 
Some of the issues he noted were 
weak performance management 
culture, inadequate resourcing 
and implementation of mandates 
and lack of transparency.

The 
“ugly,” 
according 
to 

Weiser, was visible in the U.N.’s 
lack of investigation into claims 
of sexual misconduct as well 

The University of Michigan 

Residence Halls Association 
gathered on Thursday night 
in Couzens Residence Hall to 
discuss funding for various 
student groups, as well as the 
vacant positions currently on 
their executive board created 
by the unexpected resignations 
of 
two 
members, 
one 
of 

whom cited an unwelcoming 
environment as a motivation.

Student suicide data helps admin improve mental health resources on campus

Engineering junior Anna Learis 

spends the majority of her time 
on the University of Michigan’s 
North Campus. She says learning 
in a less active environment than 
Central Campus, coupled with 
the difficulty of the engineering 
curriculum, can create a rather 
stressful environment for some 
students.

As a group leader for Wolverine 

Support Network, a participant 
in mental health monologues at 
Active Minds and a student who 
has spoken at local high schools 
about mental health, Learis spends 
a lot of her time advocating for 

improved mental health resources. 
One example of this is two years 
ago when Learis founded Mentality 
Magazine, the first mental health 
publication on any campus in the 
nation. Her experience in working 
with students who may be going 
through mental health issues has 
shown her the large need for on 
campus support systems.

Attention to these issues is part 

of what encouraged the Counseling 
and Psychological Services added 
a Wellness Center on North 
Campus to allow for better access 
to students who may feel isolated 
from mental health resources on 
Central Campus.

Earlier 
this 
month, 
the 

Associated 
Press 
surveyed 

the nation’s 100 largest public 

universities for their annual data 
on student suicides. Out of the four 
universities surveyed within the 
state of Michigan, the University 
was one of three collecting this 
data, along with Michigan State 
University and Grand Valley State 
University, while Central Michigan 
University either does not have 
data or does not regularly collect 
such statistics.

According to Sarah Daniels, 

Associate 
Dean 
of 
Students, 

current records of student suicide 
date 
back 
to 
approximately 

2010, 
however, 
Daniels 
could 

not comment on whether or not 
records exist prior to this. Daniels 
explained that because the Dean 
of Students office does serve as the 
primary contact point for those 

affected by the death of a student, 
the data the University currently 
holds in relation to student suicide 
is a subset of information on all 
student deaths.

“We receive data in a number 

of 
different 
ways 
or 
receive 

information about the death of our 
students in a number of different 
ways and then we provide support 
and care and assistance,” Daniels 
said.

Specific ways the Dean of 

Students office obtains information 
may include notification from the 
Ann Arbor Police Department, a 
family member, or a report filed 
of an incident. Though this data 
isn’t necessarily analyzed by the 
University, it can be used to

announced it would be partnering 
with 
Michigan 
Medicine 
on 

clinical trials for their Irritable 
Bowel 
Syndrome 
Diagnostic 

Guided Therapy.

IBS is a symptom-based disorder 

that may cause pain, constipation 
and bloating in the bowels. The 
syndrome affects between 25 
million and 45 million patients 
in the United States, according 
to the International Foundation 
for Functional Gastrointestinal 
Disorders.

Biomerica’s diagnostic therapy, 

InFoods®, aims to help physicians 
identify certain foods that may 
be removed from a patient’s diet 
to alleviate IBS symptoms and 
discomfort. It may be used with 
drugs currently on the market 
because it is not considered a drug, 
but rather a form of therapy.

According to Dr. William Chey, 

director of medical services for the 
Michigan Bowel Control Program 
at Michigan Medicine, since IBS is 
a syndrome, not a disease, it could 
potentially be managed with this 
therapy.

This Week in History 

Every Friday, one Daily news staffer will give a behind 
the scenes look at one of this week’s stories. This week, 
LSA freshman Riley Langefeld covered the end of net 
neutrality and its impact on the University.

“Matt was like, ’There are some people rolling a beach 
ball on the Diag,’ so I ran over there. There were these 
two guys standing by it. I just asked him why he was there 
and what he was doing there, and he said he does this all 
over college campuses. He said that Michigan has a ‘red 
light policy,’ which means that we don’t have the best free 
speech policies... The whole time I was thinking this is 
really interesting, because a lot of the time we don’t get the 
conservative perspective on the Daily. I’ve worked on a lot of 
stories where we try to reach out and sometimes they don’t 
respond, so we end up getting a liberal bias. I really enjoyed 
talking to them about their beliefs, because it was different 
than the way I feel, but we actually agreed on a lot of things. 
I just think it’s really important to have an open discourse. 
Because that’s the reason they were there.“

characteristics,” 
Chey 
said. 

“It’s comprised of a number of 
different 
diseases. 
Thinking 

about ways that we can identify 
those diseases can provide a 
more precise approach.”

Chey sees the gastrointestinal 

system as central to our bodily 
functions, connected to seven 
organs. In his research, he 
examines 
the 
role 
of 
diet 

therapies in treatment. He said 
these approaches can actually 
treat some symptoms better than 
prescription medicine.

“These dietary modifications 

… work in about half the patients,” 
Chey said. “That’s fantastic, 
that’s better than medication for 
IBS.”

The 
study 
conducted 
by 

Michigan Medicine will be a 
double-blinded 
randomized 

controlled clinical trial which 
will enroll subjects at two trial 

sites: Michigan Medicine and the 
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical 
Center in Boston. The study 
will accept IBS patients with 
constipation and diarrhea as 
primary symptoms.

In an email interview, Lina 

Nahlawi, a clinical subjects 
coordinator 
at 
Michigan 

Medicine, wrote the study will 
rely on self-reporting from the 
subjects, which could lead to 
complications in the data seeing 
as though the study doesn’t have 
a way to directly measure the 
impacts of the treatment.

“Dietary response will be 

assessed via daily symptom 
diary reports collected from 
participants 
throughout 
the 

study,” Nahlawi wrote.

Public Health student Takuro 

Miyazaki will be working as a 
study coordinator for the trials 
at the University. His interests lie 
largely in working to mitigate the 
effects of chronic disease.

funding for their efforts. 

Both 
organizations 
target 

students living in dorms for 
membership 
and 
support, 

and cited this as a reason 
for seeking residence hall 
funding. Both Omega Psi Phi 
and TASA received funding 
after 
describing 
their 

requests to representatives.

During reports from the 

executive 
board, 
various 

concerns related to unfilled 
executive board positions and 
the potential repercussions 
from this drawback arose. 
Assistant 
Director 
Eric 

Aiken assured students this 
bump in the road would not 
hinder RHA’s goals for the 
upcoming 
semester, 
and 

spots will be filled as soon as 
possible.

“We 
(have 
to) 
keep 

morale 
up,” 
Aiken 
said 

while 
addressing 
student 

representatives. “Remember 
that you have been sworn 
in to be a representative 
in order to represent the 
residents.”

These concerns follow the 

recent resignation of LSA 
sophomore 
Arsha 
Venkat, 

vice president of marketing. 
Venkat 
announced 
her 

resignation through printed 
slips of paper that were 
distributed 
to 
student 

speakers and representatives 
during 
Thursday 
night’s 

meeting.

“The environment created 

by some members of the 
executive board has been 
extremely difficult to work 
in,” 
Venkat 
wrote. 
“The 

attitudes expressed by this 
board are not in line with 
what the University claims 
to stand for.”

Venkat did not go into 

further 
detail 
regarding 

the 
reasons 
behind 
her 

resignation. 
Following 

the 
reading 
of 
Venkat’s 

statement, 
the 
assembly 

voted 
to 
accept 
Venkat’s 

resignation. 
Venkat’s 

resignation is the second 
departure from the RHA 
executive board, leaving two 
vacant spots on the board.

In an email, Engineering 

sophomore Dylan Rushton, 
the RHA president, wrote 
the executive board was 
disappointed to see Venkat’s 
resignation but hopes she has 
success in the future.

“We are sorry to see 

Arsha go,” Rushton wrote. 
“We wish her the best in her 
future endeavors.”

Additionally, 
the 

student 
representatives 

heard from Rushton and 
Engineering 
sophomore 

Matthew 
Malinak, 
the 

RHA 
Vice 
President 
of 

Records, regarding a new 
resolution 
to 
amend 
the 

process 
of 
re-electing 

representatives for a second 
year on RHA. This resolution 
guarantees 
returning 

representatives 
housing 

while serving, an incentive 
many 
representatives 

found 
attractive. 
Based 

on a very low number of 
representatives returning to 
RHA, Rushton and Malinak 
proposed a new way of 
applying for a second year.

“The best way to learn 

something is by experiencing 
it yourself,” Rushton said. 
“What we would like (are) 
elections, or at least some 
sort of selection process that 
allows 
representatives 
to 

return to this assembly.”

The assembly voted to 

pass this resolution, giving 
current representatives the 
ability to serve another term 
on RHA more easily.

POP- UP PHOTOGR APHY

ALICE LIU/Daily

The LSA Institute for the Humanities hosts a pop-up exhibition featuring photos by Margaret Condon Taylor titled “An Accidental Photographer: Seoul 1969” at 
the Institute for Humanities Thursday.

identify certain trends that may 

be occurring, such as an increase 
in student suicides within a certain 
school or college.

While this information is not 

released to the public from the 
University, the Suicide Prevention 
Resource Center’s report found 
that 24 percent of U-M students 
think about suicide, 11.3 percent 
have 
“seriously 
considered 

attempting suicide at least once 
in the last academic year” and 
1.1 percent responded to having 
attempted suicide at least once.

Learis said identifying these 

trends can be helpful in providing 
resources to areas where they are 
lacking, as was done last year on 
North Campus.

“I think by having this data and 

seeing just how student suicides 
spread 
between 
majors 
and 

schools, that will definitely raise 
awareness of those schools within 
the University that aren’t having 
their needs met,” Learis said.

Public Health junior Omar 

Ilyas agreed with Learis, stating 
such data can help the University 
identify more specific patterns, 
such as certain times throughout 
the year in which student suicide 
rates may increase or decrease. 

Ilyas currently serves on the 
CAPS Student Advisory Board, 
working with administrators and 
psychologists to bridge the gap 
between student awareness and 
programs offered by CAPS.

“A huge part of being a student 

is you do go through mental health 
issues (while on) campus, and I 
think a large avenue for that is 
depression, and depression in itself 
has so many intricacies … suicide is 
one of them,” Ilyas said.

Out of respect for the loved 

ones of the affected student, the 
Dean of Students office does not 
finalize any information without 
confirmation 
from 
medical 

examiners and related officers.

“We are very mindful of not 

ascribing a cause of death before 
it is confirmed,” Daniels said. “It 
is not for us to decide whether 
something was or was not a suicide 
or whether it was or was not a 
certain cause of death.”

Learis noted, although this 

information 
is 
important 
in 

understanding certain trends, it 
does not provide a comprehensive 
look at mental health issues on 
campus. 

“I think a bigger issue with the 

data collection is for every suicide 
that actually happens, there are so 
many suicide attempts and those 
you can’t really track,” Learis 
said. “So even though we have 
suicide numbers, it’s hard to see 
the total trends.”

When 
moving 
forward 
in 

working 
to 
alleviate 
mental 

health issues, Daniels says the 
Dean of Students office continues 
to partner with organizations, 
such as those Learis and Ilyas 
are involved in, to advocate for an 
increase in student recognition of 
resources available on campus.

CAPS, for example, made a 

series of videos under the title 
“do something: Stop Student 
Suicide.” The purpose of these 
videos, Ilyas said, is to change 
the current dialogue around the 
topic that may be considered 
taboo or kept secret, and to help 
students understand what they 
can do in scenarios in which their 
own friends may be experiencing 
suicidal thoughts.

Additionally, each year, the 

Division of Student Life and 
the 
Association 
of 
Religious 

Counselors 
hosts 
a 
campus 

memorial to honor students who 
have passed away during the year.

“When we experience a death 

in our community, we’re working 
with our campus partners and 
saying ‘what can we do, what do 
we need to do proactively, what 
should we do reactively,’ ” Daniels 
said. “I think we’ll continue that 
work and continue to talk with 
each other within Student Life 
and across the campus to figure 
out how to improve … areas of 
intervention and education, and 
creative ways to influence students 
to talk about resources that are 
available.”

met this growing demand. In the 
last five years, the CSE faculty 
has only increased by 22 percent, 
from 50 faculty members in Fall 
2013 to 61 faculty members in Fall 
2017. 

“This 
is 
something 
that’s 

happening across the country,” 
Noble said. “We sort of knew this 
was happening five years ago 
and so our strategy has been to 
hire as fast as we can and we’ll 
meet the demand. The College 
and University have been very 
supportive of us hiring faculty.”

However, 
high 
enrollment 

rates and low faculty numbers 
are not the only factors affecting 
waitlists. 
Graduate 
students 

have reportedly been registering 
for undergraduate, upper-level 
courses and taking seats intended 
for 
undergraduate 
students. 

Although 
graduate 
students 

are generally restricted from 
registering for these courses, 
some of these courses were 
placed on a different registration 
schedule.

Due 
to 
high 
numbers 
of 

declared students, the EECS-CSE 
advising office organized staged 
enrollment phases to ensure 
students in need of upper-level 
courses for graduation can obtain 
them. Most upper-level courses 
are set on a staged enrollment 
schedule, with the first phase 
from Nov. 20 to Dec. 5, the second 
phase from Dec. 6 to Dec. 8, and 
the third phase from Dec. 11 

forward. According to Noble, 
popular electives like EECS 442, 
Computer Vision, was mistakenly 
not on staged enrollment this 
term.

However, with EECS 442 

not on a restricted schedule by 
mistake, the waitlist skyrocketed 
to 176 students during registration 
and currently still has a waitlist 
of 64 students, according to the 
Winter 2018 course guide. The 
course was consequently filled up 
by masters students, since it was 
the only undergraduate CS class 
they could enroll in.

“What’s happening is a lot 

of the Electrical and Computer 
Engineering masters students 
would like to take Computer 
Science classes,” Noble said. 
“We 
don’t 
let 
them 
into 

our 
undergraduate 
classes 

because they’re reserved for 
undergraduates first, but (EECS 
442) was the only class they could 
enroll in so they flocked to it.”

However, Noble emphasized 

the EECS department grants 
registration priority to students 
with upcoming graduation dates.

“Our number one goal is to 

make sure we meet the obligation 
we committed to get students to 
graduate on time,” Noble said. 
“That doesn’t mean they’ll get the 
classes they want necessarily. For 
courses a part of our required set, 
we try really hard to never turn 
anyone away.”

Although this priority system 

works for some seniors, others 
are still placed on waitlists. Data 
Science major Anna Ten Have, 
an LSA senior, emphasized she 
does not receive as high of a 

registration priority compared to 
her peers. As a result, she will not 
know if she will get off the waitlist 
until well into the semester.

“I only registered for one 

EECS class but I was 37th on the 
waitlist when I registered,” Ten 
Have said. “It’s really annoying 
because it’s a class I really want 
to take.”

However, Noble explained how 

students with earlier enrollment 
times are signing up for extra 
classes during registration and 
dropping them after the first 
couple weeks of the term. This 
method 
subsequently 
leads 

to increased waitlists during 
registration and sudden decreases 
at the start of the semester.

“The students who have early 

enrollment dates know they’re 
never going to get into something 
if they don’t enroll right away, 
or they think that,” Noble said. 
“That happened in the fall, we 
cleared waitlists really deeply. 
In 442, the waitlist has shrunk 
significantly, that’s partly what’s 
going on.”

This 
reportedly 
places 

significant stress on not just 
juniors and seniors, but also 
underclassmen EECS students 
who are just starting out. Data 
Science major Isabelle Williams, 
an LSA sophomore, experienced 
this first hand when attempting 
to register for several EECS 
classes to stay on track with her 
coursework.

“I was waitlisted for the class I 

wanted to take, my back up class, 
and my back up class for my back 
up class,” Williams wrote in an 
email to The Daily. “I was not able 

to register for a single EECS class 
that counted for my major. This 
added considerable unnecessary 
stress to an already stressful end 
of the semester.”

Even with waitlists slowly 

decreasing at the start of the 
semester, students in the same 
situation as Williams will never 
get into the classes they want.

“I dropped the class I was 

waitlisted for because I was 
112th,” 
Williams 
said. 
“Our 

professor said 50-70 students 
were likely to get off.”

Noble 
emphasized 
these 

increased waitlists could also be 
due to the number of non-major 
LSA students who are registering 
for introductory CS courses. 
EECS 183 has increased to one of 
the highest enrolled CS classes. 
As a result, courses like EECS 183 
have unintentionally turned into 
service courses — classes for non-
major students who want to get 
grounding in the field.

“Our 100 and 200 level courses 

have become service courses in 
spite of us, so those courses are 
designed for Computer Science 
majors but lots of other people 
have decided they want to be 
computationally literate,” Noble 
said.

In order to fix these registration 

issues, 
the 
department 
aims 

to fulfill both long-term and 
short-term goals to decrease the 
waitlists while still providing 
students 
with 
the 
quality 

education they were promised.

Pettie said he is working on 

hiring additional temporary and 
tenure-track faculty to make 
up for the department’s current 

gap. According to Noble, senior 
Ph.D. students, as well as recent 
Ph.D. graduates in the area, 
are teaching approximately 10 
percent of CSE lecture sections 
on a temporary basis. Yet, with 
the program in high demand, the 
department has faced challenges 
with hiring long-term faculty 
due to competition with other 
universities.

“We’ve 
been 
doing 
a 

tremendous amount of hiring of 
temporary people to help staff 
our classes,” Pettie said. “We’re 
conducting lots of tenure-track 
searches to increase our faculty 
size and it’s very difficult because 
of the tremendous demand for CS 
courses year by year — it’s greater 
every year.”

Noble emphasized strategies, 

such as increasing lecture hall 
and class sizes and finding 
professors 
without 
full-time 

teaching appointments to teach a 
few classes.

“In the short term, how do 

we scale our classes up, how do 
we find bigger lecture rooms, 
are there more of our very (own) 
senior Ph.D. students that can take 
the time out of their academics 
to teach a class, are there more 
people in the community that can 
teach?” Noble said.

Increasing 
class 
sizes 

and 
bringing 
in 
temporary 

faculty 
can 
also 
come 

with 
repercussions. 
Noble 

highlighted the administration’s 
intent to get as many students off 
the waitlists as possible without 
sacrificing the University’s high 
education standards.

“If 
we 
feel 
like 
we’re 

compromising the quality of 
the 
educational 
experience, 

then the question is how many 
students 
can 
we 
take 
and 

still give them the Michigan 
educational experience that we 
really want to give them,” Noble 
underscored. “We want to make 
that number as big as we can, 
but we don’t want to sacrifice 
quality to do that.”

Many EECS undergraduate 

students 
are 
hopeful 
these 

changes will fix the waitlist 
issues for the future, but current 
students still may not have the 
chance to take advantage of 
every opportunity they desire.

“I came to this University to 

learn from the EECS department 
and it’s unacceptable that I 
may be unable to do that next 
semester because there are too 
many students in my field than 
the University can handle,” 
Williams said.

With 
the 
administration’s 

long-term 
goals 
to 
hire 

permanent faculty and build 
larger spaces for class, such as 
the future robotics building, 
Noble hopes these advances 
will reduce waitlists in the 
coming semesters and provide 
more 
opportunities 
for 

future 
students. 
Ultimately, 

he 
emphasized 
the 
current 

students are the department’s 
main priority.

“For the students that are 

currently enrolled, our current 
goal is to allow them to get the 
major they want in a reasonable 
amount of time and we are 
doing everything to make that 
happen,” he said.

as their supposedly negative bias 
towards Israel. Weiser brought up 
U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley’s 
speech that looked at the number 
of condemnations Israel received 
compared to those of other nations.

“The U.N. gives undo negative 

tension towards Israel,” Weiser said. 
“The Human Rights Council has 
passed 62 resolutions condemning 
reasonable actions Israel takes to 
defend its security. Meanwhile, 
human rights abusers in Syria, 
Iran and North Korea received few 
condemnations.”

Weiser ended on an uplifting 

note, explaining to the delegates 
they should not let the idea of 
perfection disrupt their ability to 
work effectively.

“Change is typically incremental, 

but perfection cannot be your goal,” 
Weiser said. “Someone famously 
said something that I quote often, 
‘Don’t let the perfect get in the way 
of the good.’”

Though 
audience 
members 

appreciated 
Weiser’s 
speech 

and felt his perspective was an 
important one to hear, others 
disagreed with aspects of what 
he presented. One of these staff 
members was Business sophomore 
Lucas Reynolds, who was unhappy 

with Weiser’s U.S.-centered focus 
when discussing the functions of 
the U.N.

“I enjoyed his speech to a point,” 

Reynolds said. “I thought some of 
the things he said regarding the 
U.N. having this vision of freedom, 
I agreed with a lot of that. However, 
I didn’t like how he focused on how 
the U.N. is supposed to be a U.S.-
centered body. I fundamentally 
disagree with that. Especially 
because now the U.N. is dealing 
with a lot of topics.”

LSA freshman Danielle Falling 

shared Reynolds’s sentiment and 
explained while the U.S. was a part 
of the U.N., it did not make up its 
entirety.

“It’s 
not 
a 
U.S.-centered 

organization, it’s the United Nations 
of the world,” Falling said. “I think 
it’s important to look at things with 
a grain of salt so we can’t just call 
the U.N. an ideal pinnacle of unity 
because there are problems.”

Falling also touched on the 

relevance of Weiser’s speech, and 
why it was necessary for younger 
individuals — especially students 
involved in Model United Nations 
— to hear.

“The students here will one day 

become the people in the United 
Nations, so they’re the ones who 
have to think about what they want 
to be changed,” Falling said. “It’s 
important to see the faults so that 
they can do that.”

R

ecruiting 
season 
for 

Ross 
undergrads 

is 
essentially 
over. 

Winter break offered much-
needed room to breathe for 
the many upperclassmen who 
have secured an internship 
or full-time job offer for the 
upcoming year. While students 
in general are at significant risk 
for developing mental health 
issues throughout college, each 
fall at Ross poses a unique kind 
of stress for upperclassmen as 
their recruiting schedules and 
academic lives strain against 
one another.

On 
paper, 
employment 

outcomes 
for 
Business 

students 
look 
incredible. 

Ninety-eight 
percent 
of 

undergraduates receive a job 
offer within three months 
of graduation, their starting 
salaries average at $72,500 
and they secure internships 
and full-time positions all over 
the United States and abroad. 
The program clearly provides 
students ample resources to 
excel in their early careers.

The journey from arriving 

on 
campus 
as 
relatively 

inexperienced 
freshmen 
to 

achieving 
those 
impressive 

numbers 
as 
upperclassmen, 

however, can be a rollercoaster. 
This is especially true during 
the 
notorious 
junior 
fall 

semester in which students 
compete with each other and 
aim to land coveted internship 
positions. 
These 
positions 

ideally translate into full-time 
return offers, and while most 
students do end up re-recruiting 
as seniors, the pressure to 
perform specifically for junior 
year internships is immense.

Mind Matters is a student 

organization 
within 
the 

Business 
School 
that 
raises 

awareness about mental health 
and wellness and works to 
decrease stigma against seeking 
help in the community. At junior 
convocation this year, members 
of the group showed the results 
of a survey administered to 
business undergraduates — they 
reported a significant spike in 
anxiety and depression during 
the junior fall semester.

Forrest Cao, founder and 

president 
of 
Mind 
Matters, 

explained in an interview that 
these experiences are common 
during recruiting.

“For 
students 
in 
this 

situation, the worst thing is for 
them to think they’re the only 
ones,” Cao said. “We’re trying to 
get people thinking about how 
this is something most people 
deal with. There is a community 
that understands and is going 
through what they feel.”

I believe some of the stress 

that 
induces 
or 
exacerbates 

mental 
health 
problems 
in 

students is unavoidable due to 
the generally difficult nature of 
any job search, regardless of the 
program they’re enrolled in. But 
recruiting at a business school is 
uniquely systematic, extremely 
competitive and placed at a 
crucial academic moment in the 
college careers of students.

Of 
the 
factors 
that 

contribute to mental health 
problems, “issues of culture, 
classes 
and 
recruiting 
are 

interlinked,” Cao said. The 
Business School can do more 
to 
mitigate 
these 
negative 

outcomes 
by 
balancing 
its 

curriculum with its recruiting 
schedule 
and 
increasing 

mental 
health 
resources 

available to students.

The most common process by 

which Business undergraduates 
find 
employment 
is 
the 

Business School’s on-campus 
recruiting 
system, 
which 
is 

highly regimented and combines 
an 
assortment 
of 
formal 

activities. Students are strongly 
encouraged to participate in 
activities the Business School 
coordinates such as individual 
company 
presentations 
and 

networking hours, career fairs 
for those applying for a position 
in a particular function or 
industry, resume drops on the 
school’s intranet and a bidding 
system for first-round interviews 
that take place in the Ross School 
of Business Building.

These various events are 

condensed 
almost 
entirely 

into the months of September 
through November each year and 
consume a significant amount 
of students’ time. In addition, 
on-campus interviews routinely 
take place during the same hours 
as class sessions and companies 
also frequently fly out students 
for final round interviews during 
the school week.

This process — combined 

with the inherently competitive 
nature of attending the same 
recruiting events and applying 
for the same positions as peers — 
is a huge undertaking to balance 
with existing academic and 
personal obligations.

As someone who had not 

worked at a large corporation 
before or previously experienced 
such a stringent sequence of 
networking events, the months 
during 
my 
own 
recruiting 

process last year were difficult. 
I frankly had no idea whether I 
was asking the right questions 
to truly get the best feel for a 
company’s culture, attending the 
right presentations (since many 
occurred at the same time) or 
even wearing the right clothes to 
fit the mysterious and ill-defined 
expectation of “business casual” 
attire at my events.

Week by week, I felt a 

whirlwind of anxieties over 
my qualifications, made tough 
calls between completing work 
shifts for my part-time job and 
attending 
endlessly 
available 

recruiting events and tackled 
the biggest career decisions of 
my life so far. It was a period 
of tremendous learning and 
self-growth, but it came with 
emotional and physical tolls I 
hadn’t anticipated in myself. 
I saw my own experiences 
reflected in my peers as they 
moved through many of the same 
decisions, obstacles, realizations 
and struggles throughout the 
semester.

While 
I 
was 
exploring 

my career so intensely, I was 
upset to find that the Business 
School incorporates its most 
rigorous academic experience 
into this semester and strictly 
assigns the junior fall course 
schedules 
for 
students. 
It 

plugs 
an 
entrepreneurship 

challenge 
mid-semester 
on 

top of normal coursework and 
schedules it in the same week 
as a significant number of 
on-campus interviews. These 
frictions, among others, made 
me constantly choose between 
dedicating my efforts to courses 
and recruiting.

The school itself doesn’t 

implement 
any 
systematic 

support 
channels 
or 
follow-

ups about how students can 
best approach recruiting and 
prioritize their mental health. 
The Business School does provide 
psychological services from one of 
the University’s CAPS counselors 
and occasionally emails links to 
articles like tips for managing 
stress. Cao has also found that 
the Business School has been 
responsive to Mind Matters’ 
efforts — it provides space for 
the 
organization’s 
meditation 

sessions and is working with 
group 
members 
to 
establish 

an “Identity and Diversity in 
Organizations” session focusing 
on mental health.

But 
I 
believe 
the 
lack 

of 
initiative 
from 
the 

administration 
itself 

demonstrates a passive position 
toward students’ well-being. 
I encourage the school to 
consider its students more in its 
program’s structure, reconcile 
its recruiting schedule with its 
curriculum as much as possible 
and continue to boost mental 
health resources. The Business 
School should recognize the 
unique position we are in as 
students, as job seekers and 
as people throughout these 
recruiting seasons and, more 
broadly, throughout our time 
in an undergraduate business 
program. 
It 
should 
build 

upon the work its students 
are already doing to promote 
mental health and well-being, 
and 
take 
direct 
action 
to 

alleviate some of the pressure 
on its community of students in 
such a critical moment.

A 

s 
a 
high 
school 

student, when I began 
my college application 

process, I knew I was part 
of a larger group. So many 
people around me were first-
generation college students, 
and 
we 
often 
struggled 

together. Upon my acceptance 
to the University of Michigan, 
that 
large 
group 
quickly 

evaporated. 
The 
people 

around me were suddenly 
from long lines of college 
graduates, and I began to feel 
out of place. My new found 
friends commented on what 
an oddity I was, braving the 
big scary school without a clue 
what I was getting into.

According 
to 
the 

University’s own statistics, 
only 
10.6 
percent 
of 
the 

students in 2013 were first 
generation, of which nearly 
half reported their parents 
had actually still attended 
some college but received no 
degree. Other top universities 
also 
have 
first-generation 

student populations of less 
than 20 percent. In fact, 
according to The New York 
Times, “The proportion of 
freshmen at elite campuses 
who are first generation — 11 
percent Dartmouth, 12 percent 
at Princeton, 14 percent at 
Yale, 15 percent at Amherst, 16 
percent at Cornell, 17 percent 
at Brown — nearly matches 
that of their low-income Pell 
grant recipients.”

The fact that these numbers 

have reached one-fifth of the 
national average might tell a 
tale of a deeper problem. These 
statistics show that there are 
clearly some more obstacles 
keeping the majority of these 
students out of universities. 
According to a 2010 study by 
the United States Department 
of 
Education, 
50 
percent 

of 
college 
students 
were 

first 
generation, 
defined 

as students whose parents 
had 
never 
attended 
a 

postsecondary school. That 
is, never pursued an education 
beyond high school.

As 
a 
first-generation 

student, the challenges of 
pursuing a higher education 
are already difficult as it 
is. Now, throw in the most 
prestigious public institutions 

of learning in the country 
and make these students a 
minority group, and it is not 
doing anything to help the 
situation. The University of 
Michigan must take steps in 
the right direction and act 
as an example for other top 
colleges to follow.

In 
recent 
years, 
the 

University has made such 
steps, especially with the 
introduction 
of 
both 
the 

HAIL Scholarship and the 
Go Blue Guarantee, which 
was introduced last year. 
These scholarships provide 
financial 
help 
to 
in-state 

students 
who 
come 
from 

diverse backgrounds and are 
not able to pay their own way 
without taking on massive 
student debt.

As a first-generation student 

and someone who finished 
high school and applied to 
college as a homeless student, 
I can sympathize with the 
struggles involved. There are 
no parents to ask for college 
advice and often no older 
siblings to ask either. If you 
are lucky, you might have 
gone to a big school or had an 
amazing college counselor to 
work with. If you were like 
me, you were homeschooled 
until 
high 
school, 
where 

your graduating class was 
26 students and neither your 
parents nor your school was 
much help. Some parents still 
think today’s world is the 
same one they grew up in half 
a century ago when you did not 
need a college education to be 
successful; you simply had to 
work hard. Nobody seems to 
understand the questions you 

might have or the anxiety one 
might feel. The people around 
you will often hold a higher 
expectation of you then you 
have been accustomed to.

Thankfully, the University 

has recently done good work 
looking out for their extreme 
minority of such students. 
Programs like Comprehensive 
Studies Program and Summer 
Bridge 
Scholars 
Program 

give students a chance to 
acclimate 
themselves 
to 

college 
life 
before 
being 

thrown into the bumbling 
confusion that is freshman 
year. These programs offer 
students a continued support 
network 
throughout 
their 

college experience, including 
specialized 
teachers, 
GSIs 

and small class sizes. Being 
placed among a group of 
students who are in a similar 
position as your own does 
wonders to help with the 
adjustment that is needed, 
though, 
in 
my 
personal 

experience, it is not always 
the best route to take for 
yourself.

The federal government, 

too, has implemented many 
programs 
throughout 
the 

country to help students like 
me. I had the pleasure and 
honor of working with a group 
called 
TRIO 
Pre-College 

during 
my 
college 
search 

and application adventures. 
They work with students in 
situations similar to mine to 
help waive application fees, 
proofread essays and even 
take 
students 
on 
campus 

tours. I am glad to have been 
assisted by them and look 
forward to helping programs 
like theirs in the future any 
way I can. Without them, I 
wouldn’t be able to hold the 
proud title of a Wolverine.

There 
is 
still 
a 
long 

way to go to make sure all 
students feel welcome at our 
university, and all colleges 
for that matter, but progress 
and 
positive 
change 
are 

being made. This situation 
often goes unnoticed and 
underappreciated, and I hope 
I am able to shed some light 
on the subject for all to gain at 
least a simple understanding.

Artists and their underappreciated albums of 2017

For 20 years, John Dwyer 
has been experimenting with 
a variety of psychedelic garage 
rock sounds that move in every 
direction, 
leaving 
drips 
of 
eccentric colors behind. After 
countless name changes, Dwyer 
and his band released 2017’s Orc 
as the Thee Oh Sees.
Orc is a 50-minute tooth-
numbing catapult into a land 
unknown. In the first two seconds 
of the record, Dwyer’s screeching 
guitar, glued with Tim Hellman’s 
bass, is accompanied by both Dan 
Rincon’s and Paul Quattrone’s 
tight and rapid drum style in a 
way where each element begins 
to vibrate into an abrupt shock of 
high voltage energy.
But as the record moves 
along, Dwyer doesn’t forget to 

give listeners time to catch their 
breath. Between every aggressive, 
slick guitar riff is a movement 
into something smoother and less 
intense, a moment of recollection 
that lasts for just the right amount 
of time until he plunges you into 
another moment of chaos.
This juxtaposition of sound 
moves fluidly within and between 
songs like the fourth track “Keys 
to the Castle.” In about eight 
minutes, “Keys to the Castle” 
takes listeners on a joyful journey 
that warps into a hypnotic 
movement of sounds, all falling 
into a blissful violin that creates 
its individual moment in the song.
The 
record’s 
stimulating 
sounds 
are 
laced 
with 
a 
theme of war, of conquering 
a forbidden place, of violence 

and the aftermath; the song 
titles of “Animated Violence” 
and “Cadaver Dog” reference a 
battleground and the dogs that 
come to pick up the pieces of the 
dismembered.
These 
dark 
and 
brutal 
references are set upon upbeat 
instrumentals, 
making 
the 
record lend itself to feelings 
of 
dissipation, 
the 
rise 
of 
goosebumps along your arms 
and warm colors dancing along 
your eyelids. It is an album that 
reinvents the admired sounds of 
the past’s psychedelic pop and 
raw noise rock bands, blending 
genres together to create an 
other-worldly environment that 
feels enticing to be in.

‘End of the F***ing World’ 
another win for Netflix

In 
this 
day 
and 
age, 
branding a show a “Netflix 
Original” is essentially the 
Midas Touch in a TV series’s 
success. Originally debuting 
in the U.K. in Oct. 2017, the 
take-off series “The End of 
the F***ing World” is brought 
to the U.S. and “only available 
on 
Netflix.” 
While 
being 
under the golden label may 
be indicative of immediate 
success in itself, the show has 
the goods to back it up.
This dark dramedy, based 
on the comic series “The End 
of the Fucking World” by 
Charles S. Forsman, follows a 
17-year-old, 
self-proclaimed 
psychopath 
James 
(Alex 
Lawther, 
“The 
Imitation 
Game”), who is looking to 
graduate from killing small 
animals to “something bigger.” 
Alyssa 
(Jessica 
Barden, 
“Hanna”), a crass, rebellious 
girl who is the picture of teen 
angst, finds herself involved 
with James — romantically she 
thinks, though his intentions 
are much more malevolent. 
The two misguided teens steal 
James’s father’s car and take 
off 
with 
nothing 
planned, 
other than James’s underlying 
motive to murder his partner 
in crime.
The 
pilot 
episode 
is 
dedicated more to establishing 

these two young protagonists 
than 
it 
is 
to 
rapid 
plot 
movement, 
and 
though 
some 
may 
describe 
this 
style as “slow,” I believe this 
character-centric focus helps 
build the viewers’s connection 
with them. James and Alyssa, 

as two emotionally unavailable 
characters who finally find 
human connection with each 
other, 
have 
an 
interesting 
dynamic — reminiscent of 
the cold, but deep, connection 
of the young protagonists in 
Wes 
Anderson’s 
“Moonrise 
Kingdom.” With the narration 
switching 
between 
James’s 
and Alyssa’s respective inner 
monologues, the viewer sees 
through their projected tough 
personas with the help of their 
vocalized internal fears.
Another way this series is 
reminiscent of Wes Anderson 
is in its cinematic symmetry, 
most clearly evident in the 
cataloging shots of animals 
James killed or letters Alyssa 
received 
from 
her 
absent 
father, all neatly arranged. 
The show’s cinematography is 
crisp, unique and compelling; 
when Alyssa is first introduced, 
she lays perfectly centered in 

the frame, staring up at the 
sky and out at the viewer. The 
writing could be described 
in a similar way. Alyssa’s 
unfiltered, sharp tongue, ready 
to attack at any given moment, 
paired with the all-but-silent 
James, provides for quick-
witted and multi-dimensional 
conversations 
between 
the 
two. 
The 
aforementioned 
cutting between characters’ 
narrations also leads to this 
dynamic flow of the script.
While my parents argued 
that 
they 
“didn’t 
quite 
get” the show, I think that 
there is something in these 
angsty teens that most, if 
not all, young people today 
can 
identify 
with. 
The 
relatable, underlying theme 
of the us-against-the-world 
mentality has the audience 
rooting for the success of these 
misanthropes. I found myself 
connected to the protagonists, 
for reasons unbeknownst to 
me since they are so rough 
around the edges; I believe 
that the ability of the show to 
keep the audience’s sympathy 
with these outsiders despite 
their 
(at 
times 
abhorrent) 
actions speaks to the quality 
of the series at large. With 
the combination of strong 
cinematography, witty writing 
and a stellar soundtrack, this 
U.K. series has just what it 
takes to nestle itself in the 
hearts 
of 
Netflix 
bingers 
across the country.

THEE OH SEES

Orc, Thee Oh Sees

Apricot Princess is butter. It’s 
a gorgeous collection of lo-fi
 
tracks recorded by singer Alex 
O’Connor, better known as Rex 
Orange County, that pulls at 
a different part of the heart. 
The 19-year-old British wonder 
makes you yearn for your first 
love and your family, your sanity 
and your best friend. Each song 
slips into your mind, eases 
between the ears and into your 
soul. Before this album, I didn’t 
know what it meant to melt.

Released in April of this past 
year, the LP predated Rex’s 
breakthrough 
on 
Tyler 
the 
Creator’s Flower Boy, released 
later that summer. From there, 
his fame skyrocketed. Rex’s 
ability to string together lyrics 
alongside 
the 
jazz-infused, 
soulful nature of his music 
makes his age disappear behind 
the noise. Songs like “4 Seasons” 
and “Television/So Far So Good” 
are 
both 
tear-inducing 
and 
dance-worthy. Every situation, 

be it a family reunion or drawn-
out cries of “What about me?” 
hits personally, not contingent 
on whether you’ve felt the 
love he sings about. “Untitled” 
welcomes 
tears, 
“Nothing” 
evokes nostalgia, but the only 
thing the album truly depends 
on is what the listener brings to 
it. The songs are only complete 
then, narratives fully formed 
only when his notes hit our ears.

DADDY ISSUES

“I was gonna write a song about 
you sucking and look at your 
pictures / Hang with your friend I 
planned on kissing,” opens “High 
Street” off of Daddy Issues’s 
2017 release Deep Dream. A lyric 
delivered 
with 
nonchalance, 
monotone and a hint of spite, it 
acts almost like a sonic thesis for 
the rest of the album. And this is 
just a taste of the dreamy malice 
that Daddy Issues curates on their 
incredible sophomore release.
Deep Dream is an album fully 
concerned with emotional and 
physical detachment. It embraces 
the hatred and other unhealthy 
tendencies that follow breakups, 
delivered on wave after wave 
of grungy rhythms, some pop 

flare and sugary vocals. On “Dog 
Years,” guitarist/vocalist Jenna 
Moynihan delivers a scathing 
declaration: “I know how it ends 
/ We’re not gonna be friends / 
In dog years you’re dead.” On 
“Boring Girls,” she bites over the 
closing shrill drone: “Boring boy / 
don’t hurt yourself / I don’t think 
they have guitars in hell.” These 
lyrical gems are innumerable, 
with 
nearly 
every 
track 
containing a poignant emotional 
punch, directed both outward 
and inward.
An album revolving mostly 
around negativity might hardly 
seem enjoyable, but it’s the 
emotional 
delivery 
of 
these 
sentiments that contains such 

brutally relatable honesty. The 
pop on “In Your Head” translates 
the scathing triumph of being 
the more stable half of a failed 
relationship. The monotone that 
pervades the album draws out the 
numbness associated with love 
turned to hate. Deep Dream is a 
harsh look at the human psyche 
of young adults dealing with 
the messiness of interpersonal 
intimacy, and it does so with an 
impressively composed delivery.
Oh, and they also include a lo-fi 
cover of Don Henley’s “The Boys 
of Summer,” which in and of itself 
kicks so much ass.

Doug Horn Trio to move 
audience at Kerrytown

A 
determining 
factor 
of 
a 
performance 
stems 
from 
whether there is a story being 
told, whether the music on 
the page comes to life and the 
musicians inspire the audience 
to do more than just follow the 
melodic line. The Doug Horn 
Trio will make it hard not to 
do more; it will be only natural 
to visualize, imagine and truly 
experience the music as they 
bring more than just a wide 
range of jazz standards and 

originals at the Kerrytown 
Concert 
House. 
With 
each 
tune backed by personal life 
experiences 
and 
memories, 
stories will fill the hall. In such 
an intimate venue and with a 
personal history behind each 
song, it is without a doubt that 
the Doug Horn Trio will bring 
the audience a remarkable and 
reminiscent experience. 
While the trio is more of 
a traditional and classic jazz 
group, they will be performing 
pieces of all influences: soulful 
tunes, ballads, rumba, country 
soul and Latin tunes. The 
concert is bound to inspire 

audience 
members 
of 
all 
backgrounds.
“We are trying to preserve the 
American songbook,” explained 
Doug Horn, saxophone player 
of the trio. They will be playing 
classics such as “If Ever I 
Would Leave You” by Robert 
Goulet, “You Don’t Know Me” 
by Eddy Arnold (though largely 
made famous by Ray Charles), 
“Heartaches” by Patsy Cline 
and others. Behind many of the 
selections are stories.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

“I’m 
old 
school,” 
Ramona 
Collins said with a laugh when 
describing what’s in store for 
her show this Saturday night at 
Kerrytown Concert House. “I 
know a lot of singers use a set list, 
but I don’t always know what I 
want to sing until I get to the room 
and see what the room is like, 
what the crowd is like, what the 
musicians are like.”
Collins, a jazz singer born and 
based out of Toledo, is a veteran 
of the music scene around the 
state of Michigan. Throughout her 
50-year career, Collins has been a 
regular performer at well-known 
clubs and venues around the area 
— including The Elks, the Dirty 
Dog Jazz Café, Cliff Bells and 
Baker’s Keyboard Lounge. These 
are staples in the greater Detroit 
area.
“Some people think I’m from 
Detroit,” Collins said. “That gives 
you an idea of how much I must 
work there.”
In Ann Arbor, Collins was 
a longtime regular at Bird of 
Paradise Nightclub — Ann Arbor’s 
longest standing jazz club — before 
it closed in 2004.
“That’s how I got to know Ann 
Arbor pretty well and meet a lot 
of people from here,” Collins said, 
noting that it was one of her all-
time favorite venues over the span 
of her career. “I loved the Bird of 
Paradise. I like the way the room 
was laid out, and the way that I 
was very close to the people. I 
like rooms where I’m close to the 

people because I don’t always 
stay on stage — I go out into the 
audience. I like intimate rooms.”
Lucky for Collins, and for her 
Saturday 
night 
audience, 
the 
Kerrytown Concert House is quite 
intimate, holding a maximum of 
110 seats. Even the seats in the back 
row are likely no more than 20 feet 
away from the performers. This 
gives Collins an opportunity to 
connect with the audience in ways 
that may not be as feasible in a 
bigger venue. For example, Collins 
will likely give a “set-up” — a little 
story or monologue that is done 
prior to performing — to introduce 
many of the songs she will sing.
“I remember in 1972, I was 
working 
somewhere 
and 
I 
remember a singer did a set-up 
before she went into the song, and 
I said to myself: ‘Aw man, I gotta 
learn how to do that.’ I was in my 
early 20s back then, maybe late 
teens,” Collins said. “Most people 
who know that story find it hard to 
believe I was ever shy, but I was.”
Collins 
began 
singing 
professionally when she was just 
18 years old, but was exposed to 
the lifestyle of performing long 
before.
“My mother was a musician and 
she used to take me to jam sessions 
in Lansing when I was about 16 
years old because I was very, very 
shy,” said Collins of her childhood. 
Collins never had a formal music 
training and is living proof that it 
takes more than private lessons to 
be a successful musician.
“I was doing this before jazz 
went to college,” Collins said with 
a laugh. “I’m not formally trained; 
I never went to school or anything. 

Over time, I acquired some skills 
and have mentored a lot of young 
people, and it’s nice that they go to 
school to get formal training. But I 
also tell people that you can’t be so 
formal and so technical that you’re 
unable to relate to people. When 
you’re doing a concert, you want 
people to feel something. Music 
has the power to make people 
laugh, cry, sweat; if you’re not able 
to make people feel anything, then 
maybe you need to really analyze 
what’s going on with you. Because 
that’s the thing about music: you 
have the power to use a song as 
a vehicle to reach people. And if 
you can’t do that, there’s definitely 
something missing. And they 
don’t teach that in schools. It’s 
something you either have or don’t 
have.”
This is Collins’s fourth time 
performing at Kerrytown Concert 
House. “I’m looking forward 
to working with the cats,” said 
Collins. “I love these musicians. 
I’ve 
known 
Sean 
(Dobbins, 
Saturday night’s drummer) since 
he was 17 years old. I’d always 
see him at the Bird of Paradise, 
tapping his stick against the table. 
It’s funny, because I’m going to 
do a gig in February, and Sean’s 
son will be playing the drums. It’s 
funny how time flies and things 
change.”
For this Saturday’s concert, 
tickets are 15 dollars for General 
Admission, 20 dollars for assigned 
rows 3-5, 30 dollars for assigned 
rows 1-2 and five dollars for 
students. Collins will also be 
performing with Cliff Monear on 
piano, Kurt Krahnke on bass and 
Dwight Adams on trumpet.

A bookish girl from a techy 
town, I stopped reading sometime 
in the early 2010s. It started 
when the Borders Bookstore in 
downtown Palo Alto was replaced 
by a Blue Bottle and ended when I 
(incorrectly) concluded that I was 
destined to go to medical school. 
This future dermatologist had no 
time for books, let alone fiction.
Unlike the techy tadpoles I’d 
swum with in high school, Ann 
Arbor introduced a new cast of 
characters that said: “Reading is 
cool!” I remembered that I didn’t 
disagree. I started to test the 
waters with the whole “fiction” 
thing again, but soon realized 
that watching an episode of 
“Buffy” before bed was so much 
easier than reading a chapter of 
Jonathan Safran Foer’s latest.
In May of 2016, I picked up Ann 
Patchett’s “Truth and Beauty: 
A Friendship” and proceeded to 
quickly and irreversibly fall back 
in love with reading. A meditation 
on writing, on friendship and 
on what writing can do to a 
friendship, Patchett’s first work 
of non-fiction is gut-wrenching 
and beautiful, even beautifully 
gut-wrenching. This book forced 
me to face a secret that I hid so 
well, I’d forgotten it myself: That, 
above all else, I wanted to be a 
Writer with a capital “W.”
“Truth and Beauty” follows 
the 
decades-long 
friendship 
between 
Patchett 
and 
Lucy 
Grealy, an accomplished poet 
and writer of “Autobiography 
of a Face.” The duo met at Sarah 
Lawrence, their alma mater, and 
roomed together in the following 
years at the prestigious Iowa’s 
Writers Workshop. In writing 
and in life, they understood 
each other perhaps only the 
way writers could. And, while 
the book delineates the rocky 
progression of their respective 
careers, it’s clear that love of the 
craft serves merely as the meet-
cute of their story: Patchett’s 
insightful and hilarious prose 
on Lucy, her character and her 
radiance, reads more like a love 
letter than anything else.
Art has a way of finding us 
when we’re most susceptible. As 

such, I read Patchett’s glorious 
ode to female friendship when I 
was at the tail end of mourning a 
gruesome friend break-up of my 
own. Needless to say, it hit close 
to home.
I 
first 
discovered 
“Truth 
and Beauty” reading Patchett’s 
published collection of essays 
titled, “This Is the Story of a 
Happy 
Marriage.” 
The 
title 
seeped 
with 
sarcasm 
and 
promised anything but a romantic 
fairytale. May relationships crash 
and burn, I say, as President of 
the Infamously Single Club. What 
I got, however, was a series of 
insightful essays on her career, 
the individuals that shaped her 
career (including Lucy) and — 
my favorite — a piece on her 
tumultuous 
relationship 
with 
writing itself. To paraphrase: 
She describes that wonderful 
idea, the kind that dawns on you 
at three o’clock in the morning, 
as a butterfly — free, colorful, 
alive. The author feeds and 
nurtures it in her imagination 
as it flutters above. But, just as 
the author puts pen to paper to 
write that damn great idea down, 
she inadvertently sticks a pin 
right in the belly of the beautiful 
butterfly, 
immortalizing 
the 
ephemeral creature in a glass box. 
That murder, Patchett writes, 
is just like the task of writing. 
Brutal, unforgiving, but hopefully 
still beautiful.
Ann Patchett stuck a needle 
through the heart of the butterfly 
that told the story of her friendship 
with Lucy, and it must have really 
hurt. Lucy lost her jaw to cancer 
at age nine, an operation that left 
her with a facial disfigurement 
that shaped the course of her life. 
In a life-long search for unfound 
identity and untapped happiness, 
Lucy leaned on Ann for the sweet 
affirmations that stick female 
friendships together like honey. 
(Maybe male friends do this too, 
but on this, I cannot comment. 
The lack of information that men 
seem to share with each other 
continues to baffle.) “Tell me I’m 
pretty?” Lucy would ask Ann. She 
told her, and told her everything 
was going to be fine. But the 
beauty that Ann saw in her best 
friend was lost somewhere in the 
exchange of compliments, never 
really reaching its destination. 

For how often do we see the 
vibrancy and resilience in our 
female confidants who can’t 
internalize it themselves?
Following 
the 
Workshop, 
Lucy and Ann wrote letters to 
each other, some of which Ann 
includes in “Truth and Beauty.” 
In their practice of sharing 
writing — one I now understand 
to be incredibly intimate — Ann 
sees Lucy’s train wreck coming, 
even from the other side of the 
world. Waging a continuous 
battle with herself, Lucy soon 
found her career and personal 
life joining the armed troops. In 
one letter, a teardrop stains the 
paper where Lucy writes to Ann, 
her depression deepening and 
loneliness encroaching. Ann, one 
helpless half of the love affair, 
could say nothing to remedy.
In the narrative of Ann and 
Lucy’s love story, I was able to 
delineate elements of my own. 
We — my Lucy and I 
— met in 
high school and became best 
friends the way young girls can. 
We knew everything there was 
to know about each other — 
what the other had for breakfast, 
what homework awaited that 
afternoon, what she’d texted 
that boy yesterday. One night, 
we cried about something now 
insignificant while sitting on 
our respective beds, 3.62 miles 
away from each other, phones to 
our ears. Still, we were together. 
Ours was the kind of friendship 
we believed that, as much as 
anyone can believe anything, 
would last. We would be at each 
other’s weddings, our kids would 
get married, our husbands would 
die before us and we would finally 
be able to live together in our old 
age. And then life got in the way.
I read “Truth and Beauty” 
when it had been almost eight 
months since my Lucy and I 
had last spoken. I’d finished 
my sophomore year of college, 
found new friends, often skipped 
breakfast and texted new boys. 
I suspected that she did, too. In 
Ann Patchett’s detailed, loving 
and painful recollection of her 
friendship with Lucy, I relived my 
own affair all over again.
I inhaled “Truth and Beauty” 
in a single day. Then I read it 
again, and thought about how 
beautiful my long-lost friend is.

Books that built us:
‘Truth and Beauty’

‘Molly’s Game’ fantastic, 
frenetic entertainment

If you like Aaron Sorkin (“The 
Social Network”), you will like 
“Molly’s Game,” his directorial 
debut from a script that he also 
wrote. If you can’t stand the guy, 
this movie is definitely not for you. 
That’s essentially the only question 
any audience members should ask 
themselves when deciding whether 
or not to see this film. Jessica 
Chastain (“Zero Dark Thirty”) 
is incredible. Idris Elba (“Thor: 
Ragnorak”) continues to prove why 
he’s one of the best working actors 
today. Kevin Costner (“McFarland, 
USA”) is kind of annoying. But none 
of this matters because the script 
is so Sorkin-esque, filled to the 
brim with flashbacks, quick cuts, 
voiceovers and fast-talking people 
moving at a rapid-fire pace. If you 
aren’t on board right from the first 
frame, the movie is going to blow 
right by you and never look back. 
Add in a true story component that 
is based on Molly Bloom’s own 
memoirs of her insane life, and 
you have one of the most purely 
entertaining films of the pre-Oscar 
season.
Those who love “The Social 
Network” and “The West Wing” 
will likely find a lot to like here. 
Sorkin keeps the story moving as 
fast as physically possible, flying 
through years of story in what feels 
like a brief (if, at times, exhausting) 
two and a half hours. The story 
follows Molly Bloom, a former 
Olympic level athlete who slowly 
finds herself at the center of the 

biggest and most elaborate poker 
game in Los Angeles. Chastain 
carries the brunt of the film, and if 
she wasn’t as strong of an actress as 
she is, it’s likely the sheer amount 

of voiceover would collapse the 
movie under its own weight. But 
luckily, Chastain is as talented an 
actor as Sorkin is a writer, and the 
movie never feels bogged down 
in exposition, despite its heavy 
presence in most of the scenes. 
Michael Cera (“Sausage Party”) 
is featured prominently in the 
first half of the film as “Player X,” 
an amalgam of various real-life 
celebrities. Cera brings out a side of 
himself that hasn’t been seen before 
onscreen: a menacing, insane, 
evil presence that is legitimately 
frightening. It certainly seems 
possible that after “Molly’s Game,” 
Cera might have a future as a Bond 
villain.
One storyline that not only 
feels inessential but also detracts 
from the film as a whole is the 
relationship between Molly and 
her father, played by Costner. 
Costner and his verbally abusive 
relationship with Molly is a major 
focus of the first third of the 
film before falling away almost 
completely in the second act, only 

to reappear completely out of the 
blue and stop the entire movie in its 
tracks. Molly’s father, as portrayed 
in the film, is a psychologist 
obsessed with Freud and other 
methods 
of 
old-fashioned 
psychology. He reappears when 
Molly is at her lowest point in 
order to psychoanalyze her and 
explain every single action both 
she and he have taken in the film. 
It’s a clear example of something 
Sorkin has been habitually accused 
of: mansplaining. It also feels 
disingenuous to the story being 
told. It recontextualizes the entire 
narrative to being about Molly’s 
father, taking away some of her 
own agency in the process. The 
scene in question leaves a bad taste 
that is quickly washed away when 
Costner leaves the frame, only to 
reappear once more, briefly, at the 
end. However, it still feels like this 
scene, and this entire storyline, 
probably wasn’t necessary to tell 
Molly Bloom’s story. 
“Molly’s 
Game” 
is 
second 
only to the HBO series “The 
Newsroom” in terms of being 
pure Sorkin. It feels similar to 
“The Hateful Eight” in that the 
film is a juiced-up version of the 
director’s style. For those who 
will eat up anything Sorkin writes 
(and now, it appears, directs), this 
movie is a must-see. For those who 
find the man and his work to be 
patronizing and obnoxious, there 
is nothing here that will change 
your mind. For the rest, “Molly’s 
Game” is a thoroughly well-made 
piece of entertainment, one that 
tells a truly fascinating story in 
memorable fashion.

With stingy defense, Michigan looking for more goals against Minnesota

Michigan coach Mel Pearson 

described his hockey team’s 
last two games against then-
No. 2 Notre Dame as two of its 
best.

With a renewed energy on 

defense and a highly-effective 
— 
and 
newly-appointed 

— 
starting 
goaltender 
in 

sophomore Hayden Lavigne, 
the Wolverines (3-7-2-1 Big Ten, 
8-10-2 overall) look to leverage 
these strengths the remainder 
of the season and catapult into 
the NCAA Tournament hunt.

Last weekend in its home-

and-home series against the 
Fighting Irish, Michigan — its 
team offense currently ranked 
second in the Big Ten and 13th 
in the country — peppered the 
nation’s third-best defense with 
70 total shots. Unfortunately 
for the Wolverines, only two of 
those shots found the back of 
the net, leading to a pair of 2-1 
losses.

Just as some facets are 

starting to click, a major — and 
vitally important — piece to the 
equation has slowly declined: 
goal-scoring.

Despite 
success 
in 
some 

areas, Michigan is focused 
on reviving its offense and 
picking 
up 
much-needed 

conference wins 
this weekend at 
Minnesota (4-7-
1-1, 13-10-1).

To get back 

in 
the 
win 

column — with 
only 
one 
win 

in the last five 
contests — goal-
scoring and the 
effectiveness of 
special 
teams 

will be keys to 
victory, according to Pearson.

“We have to compete, first 

and foremost,” Pearson said. 
“We have to play smart and 
execute 
our 
game 
plan. 
I 

thought we did that against 
Notre Dame, but we didn’t 

score. One area we also have 
to get better at is our special 
teams.

“But we’re doing a lot of 

really 
good 

things, too. We 
have 
to 
make 

sure 
that 
we 

continue to do 
the things we’re 
doing well and 
continue to get 
better at those. 
But 
there 
are 

one or two areas 
of our game that 
we have to clean 
up 
and 
that’ll 

help us. That’ll take us from 
being in a tight game and losing 
to being in a tight game and 
winning.”

Pearson 
described 
senior 

forward 
Tony 
Calderone, 

junior forward Cooper Marody 

and freshman forward Josh 
Norris as “natural scorers.” But 
he noted other players don’t 
possess that innate ability. 
Instead, they need to be molded 
into scorers — from secondary 
contributors to score sheet 
stuffers.

The coaching staff stressed 

scoring 
techniques 
during 

practice, 
working 
with 

individual skaters on releasing 
the puck faster and changing 
the puck’s angle when shooting. 
Fine-tuning these skills will 
help 
combat 
a 
Minnesota 

defense that allows a stingy 
2.38 goals per game, third-
lowest in the conference.

Michigan’s 
special 
teams 

are also struggling, with both 
the power play and penalty kill 
units falling flat against the 
Fighting Irish.

The 
Wolverines 
mustered 

just five shots and no goals 
on four power plays and gave 
up two quality Notre Dame 
shorthanded 
chances. 
The 

penalty kill also sputtered, 
allowing both goals Friday and 
the game-winner Sunday.

Thus, special team drills and 

breakouts from the defensive 
zone were emphasized during 
Wednesday’s practice at the 
Ann 
Arbor 
Ice 
Cube, 
the 

Olympic-size rink used this 
week to match the dimensions 
of Minnesota’s rink.

When the two teams squared 

off in November in Ann Arbor, 
the 
Wolverines 
won 
the 

weekend series over the then-
fourth-ranked Golden Gophers 
in dramatic, come-from-behind 
fashion. After trailing by three 
and four goals in successive 
games, they rallied to a 5-4 
overtime victory and a 6-6 tie 

the next night.

While Michigan reflects on 

its 
accomplishments 
during 

the first series between the 
teams, it’s also 
conscious 
of 

the 
different 

circumstances 
this 
time 

around. 
Both 

teams 
have 

evolved 
into 

different 
identities more 
than 
halfway 

through 
the 

season, 
and 

Minnesota now 
has the home-ice advantage.

“I expect different games,” 

Pearson said. “I don’t think 
they’ll be as high-scoring as we 
saw earlier in the year. I think 
both teams have gotten much 
better defensively and have 

much better goaltending.

“We have a road mentality 

now. You have to make sure 
you play disciplined, you take 
advantage of the chances you 
get, you don’t give them many 
chances. … I think if we can do 
those things, we’ll have success 
over the weekend.”

The 
positives 
of 
late 

— 
including 
limiting 

turnovers 
in 
the 
neutral 

zone, 
squashing 
opponent’s 

scoring 
opportunities 
and 

elite netminding — helped the 
Wolverines play high-caliber 
hockey against one of the 
nation’s best in the Fighting 
Irish.

But to get over what Pearson 

referred to as “the hump” and 
win upcoming games against 
formidable Big Ten opponents, 
the scoring and special teams 
will 
need 
to 
be 
improved 

— starting this weekend in 
Minneapolis.

And 
the 
players 
are 

optimistic they can do just that.

“We need to keep doing 

what we’re doing,” Norris said. 
“I know we’ve fallen short a 
couple times, but Coach always 
says it’s not about the results but 
about the process, so I think as 
long as we listen to what they’re 
saying 
and 
implementing 

what they want us to do, we’ll 
be fine. We have to bring our 

character 
and 

our work ethic 
to Minnesota.”

Added 

freshman 
defenseman 
Quinn 
Hughes: 

“The 
Big 
Ten 

is 
obviously 

a 
really 
good 

league and that 
anyone can beat 
anyone on any 
given 
night. 

We’re very confident in our 
game right now, so we know 
that any night when we play our 
‘A’ game, we can beat anyone.

“Two 
big 
games 
at 

Minnesota, hopefully we can 
sweep.”

Coon, ‘M’ set for tough 
task against Penn State

This Friday, the Michigan 

wrestling team will seek to 
dethrone one of the greatest 
programs in collegiate wrestling 
and the nation’s top-ranked 
team: Penn State (1-0 Big Ten, 5-0 
overall).

Emotions will be high in what 

is sure to be a packed Crisler 
Center as the eighth-ranked 
Wolverines (2-0, 5-2) attempt 
to cement themselves as a title 
contender.

After a shaky start to the 

season with a 27-9 loss to Lehigh, 
Michigan has righted the ship, 
racking up one impressive win 
after another. Two of those wins 
were complete shutouts, as the 
Wolverines blanked Oregon State 
and Indiana in back-to-back 
matches.

These statement wins only 

add to the excitement that comes 
with facing a top program. 
Michigan has proven it has the 
chops to dominate lesser teams, 
but can it come up big against 
elite competition?

Friday night’s event against 

the Nittany Lions will surely 
answer that question, with a 
slew 
of 
big-ticket 
matchups 

set to unfold. Highly-ranked 
wrestlers in nearly every weight 
class will face off, as matches in 
the 157, 165, 174, 184, 197-pound 
and heavyweight weight classes 
will feature a ranked wrestler 
from either team — including five 
matches between All-Americans.

This will undoubtedly be the 

toughest lineup Michigan has 
seen thus far, as Penn State has 
five returning NCAA champions. 
This season, these wrestlers all 
remain ranked in the top-two in 
their respective weight class.

“We’re just gonna have to 

wrestle tough,” said fifth-year 
senior Adam Coon. “There’s 
gonna be a lot of hard-nosed 

matches out there, so we just 
have to go out there and put 
everything on the mat. It’s gonna 
be a fun dual.”

To add to the big-match feel, 

this will be the first time that any 
of these wrestlers will compete in 
the Crisler Center.

“I’m excited,” Coon said. “I 

know a lot of the guys are excited 
because it’s the first time — in at 
least five years because in five 
years, we’ve never wrestled in 
Crisler.”

Something 
else 
these 

Wolverines have not seen is a win 
against Penn State. Michigan has 
come up short the last six times 
it has faced the Nittany Lions. 
Its last win against Penn State 
came before any of the current 
wrestlers were on the roster.

In preparation for this titanic 

showdown, the Wolverines have 
been hard at work and are now 
finishing up a week-long taper to 
assure the wrestlers are fresh for 
the event.

“We 
are 
always 
making 

adjustments as we go along,” said 
Michigan coach Joe McFarland. 
“We are constantly evaluating 
team aspects, individuals and 
what the individual guys need 
— now we’re cutting back and 
making sure our guys go out 
there with a lot of zip.”

Michigan will need all the 

energy and effort it can get as 
Friday’s 
match 
will 
feature 

the 
highest-ranked 
wrestling 

matchup on the Ann Arbor 
campus since 2010.

“For all the guys, it’s gonna 

be seven minutes with nothing 
but a great effort,” McFarland 
said. “You’ll see a lot of action, 
hopefully you’ll see a lot points 
getting put up on the board 
from both teams which makes 
for exciting individual matches. 
Give it a try, if you’ve never seen 
a collegiate wrestling match 
before, we’re gonna have a great 
crowd.”

Offensive analyst departing for NFL job

In the latest — and certainly not 

last — rotation of the Michigan 
football coaching carousel, Scott 
Turner has accepted a job as 
the quarterbacks coach for the 
Carolina 
Panthers, 
according 

to an ESPN 
report.

Turner, 

formerly the 
Wolverines’ 
senior 
offensive 

analyst, leaves Harbaugh’s staff 
less than a year after he was 
hired. Word of Turner’s hiring 
comes just hours after his father 
and long-time NFL coach, Norv, 
was named Carolina’s offensive 
coordinator. 

Turner will leave the staff after 

a turbulent season offensively 
for Michigan. The Wolverines 
ranked 86th nationally in points 
per game, their lowest such 
ranking 
since 
the 
2008-09 

season. The trio of quarterbacks 
— 
redshirt 
junior 
Wilton 

Speight, fifth-year senior John 
O’Korn and redshirt freshman 
Brandon Peters — combined to 
throw for more interceptions 
(10) than touchdowns (9), while 
completing just 53 percent of 
their passes.

Turner, 
who 
started 
his 

career with the Panthers in 
2011, will head back to Carolina 
already having a plethora of NFL 
experience under his belt. Before 
coming to Michigan, he spent 
three 
seasons 
working 
with 

Teddy Bridgewater in Minnesota. 
Turner also spent a season 
working as a wide receivers coach 
with the Cleveland Browns.

While his position title of 

“senior offensive analyst” may 
not 
require 
a 
“like-for-like” 

replacement, Turner’s departure 
only adds to the list of coaching 
vacancies Harbaugh will likely 
fill in the coming weeks.

Coaching contracts finalized 
While Turner and others leave, 

the incoming staff is starting to 
formally take shape.

Nearly 
a 
month 
after 

moving on from strength and 
conditioning 
coach 
Kevin 

Tolbert, Michigan finalized an 
agreement with former Arkansas 
coach Ben Herbert to the same 
position. Herbert spent the last 
five seasons on staff with the 
Razorbacks, and previously spent 
11 seasons with Wisconsin.

The move comes just weeks 

after 
Harbaugh 
called 
for 

Michigan to “get stronger” going 
into next season.

“We 
need 
to 
do 
that,” 

Harbaugh said after his team’s 
bowl loss to South Carolina. “We 
need improvement. We need to 
get stronger. Need to get better.” 

Harbaugh’s 
emphasis 
on 

strength 
and 
conditioning 

possibly stems from the fact 
that the Wolverines scored zero 
points in the fourth quarter of 
their final three games, all losses. 

On the defensive side, Al 

Washington finalized a two-
year deal to become Michigan’s 
linebackers and special teams 
coach. Washington will come 
to Ann Arbor from Cincinnati, 
where he served as a defensive 
line coach for one season. 

And offensively, Dan Enos — 

hired last week without offering 
a specific title — will coach the 
wide receivers, according to a 
report in the Detroit Free Press. 
Enos will make $150,000 his 
first year on staff, with a $50,000 
increase each year after that, the 
report says. 

Michigan did not have a coach 

on staff delegated as the “wide 
receivers coach” last season, 
though Pep Hamilton largely 
assumed that role under his title 
of “passing game coordinator.” 
Hamilton — according to a tweet 
from Bruce Feldman of Fox Sports 

— may be under consideration for 
a position in Jon Gruden’s staff 
with the Oakland Raiders.

That 
enough 
rumors 
and 

semantics for you?

Because of the Wolverines’ 

disappointing 8-5 finish — and 
the nature of their struggles — 
this is an offseason fraught with 
staff turnover and widespread 
change. 

Buckle up. It’s only January.
Vegas 
odds 
and 
early 

rankings released

In an annual tradition of 

turning attention to the next 
season immediately after the 
previous, Las Vegas released its 
odds to win the 2018-19 national 
championship. Perhaps to the 
surprise of some who watched 
Michigan scuffle to an 8-5 record, 
the Wolverines opened as 10-1 
odds to win the title. 

Michigan trails just reigning 

national 
champion, 
Alabama 

(3-1), runner-up, Georgia (9-2), 
Clemson (6-1) and Ohio State 
(8-1). Those four teams combined 
for a 50-7 record this season.

The 
heaping 
expectations 

for next season are largely 
contingient upon the eligibility 
of transfer quarterback Shea 
Patterson, who was the top-
ranked quarterback in the 2016 
recruiting class. 

AthalonSports.com 
ranked 

the Wolverines seventh in their 
“Way-too-early top 25,” citing 
an intriguing returning defense 
and the potential growth of the 
receiving corps.

“After a rebuilding year in 

2017, the Wolverines are poised 
for a rebound back into the top 
10 in 2018,” Athlon writes. “Don 
Brown’s defense should rank 
among the best in the nation 
once again. This unit is slated to 
return nearly intact, but tackle 
Maurice Hurst and linebacker 
Mike McCray depart to the NFL. 
Linebacker Devin Bush and end 
Rashan Gary should push for All-
American honors, with Khaleke 
Hudson (LB) and cornerback 
Lavert Hill returning as key 
contributors.”

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh will need to look for a new offensive analyst in the near future.

Behind Enemy Lines: Michigan State’s sophomore wing Miles Bridges

“New year, new me” is as 

applicable to you as it is to the 
Michigan State men’s basketball 
team. In the 2016-17 season, the 
Spartans began the year ranked 
at No. 12, eventually sliding to 
become a No. 9 seed in the NCAA 
Tournament and ducking out in 
the first weekend with a loss to 
Kansas. Against its in-state rival, 
Michigan State defended home 
court against Michigan, and then 
got blown out by 29 the next week 
in Ann Arbor.

But in 2017-18, the fourth-

ranked Spartans (4-1 Big Ten, 
16-2 overall) are facing outsized 
expectations. Beating Michigan 
(3-2, 14-4) after last year’s defeat 
will only strengthen an already 
resolute claim. Featuring one of 
the most talented lineups in the 
country, Michigan State has it all 
to be a national title contender: 
size, speed and shooting.

The Spartans’ frontcourt — 

anchored by standout forwards 
Nick Ward and Jaren Jackson 
Jr. — leads the country in blocks. 
Guard Cassius Winston leads the 
Big Ten in assists. And star guard 
Miles Bridges, perhaps the most 
athletically gifted player in the 

nation, does just about everything 
on the court — he averages 16.5 
points, 7.5 boards and 3.1 assists 
on a roster with no shortage of 
firepower.

Before 
this 
past 
week, 

Michigan State had won 14 
consecutive games, taking the 
nation’s top ranking in the 
process.

But then the Spartans, who 

had averaged 104 points per game 
in the prior five-game stretch, 
suddenly went cold. First they lost 
to Ohio State on the road by 16. 
Then they nearly lost to perennial 
conference doormat Rutgers at 
home, eking out a 76-72 overtime 
win Wednesday night.

Bridges has struggled over 

the past two games. He has shot 
10-of-29 from the field. As Bridges 
goes, so does Michigan State’s 
offense — which means this only 
adds to the notion that he is their 
most important player.

The Daily sat down with 

Bridges at Big Ten Media Day 
in October to talk about his 
surprising decision to forego the 
NBA draft, his expectations for 
himself and Michigan State this 
season and more. 

The Michigan Daily: Your 

return was unexpected to just 
about everybody on the outside. 

What factors drove that decision?

Miles Bridges: I knew we had 

a good team coming back, we had 
a lot of returning players. I feel 
like I didn’t live out my college 
experience like I wanted to, so me 
coming back is about spending 
time with my teammates, and 
hopefully making it far in the 
tournament. 
My 
mom, 
she 

wanted me to go, but it was my 
decision and she supported me at 
the end of the day. That’s why I say 
Michigan State is brotherhood. 
They were gonna support me 
no matter what I did, if I left or 
if I stayed, and that’s why I love 
Michigan State.

TMD: 
If 
Michigan 
State 

doesn’t get to that stage of the 
tournament, is there any point of 
regret from that decision?

MB: I won’t have any regrets, 

everything happens for a reason. 
When it’s my time to go to the 
NBA, I’ll know it’s my time.

TMD: How different is life 

from only a year ago?

MB: I’m more comfortable. 

I’m more well-known now — the 
whole team is. Even with my team 
I have a lot of chemistry with 
them. And class is different, too, 
because even the teachers know 
me.

“It’s gonna be 
a great game 
between these 

teams.”

Beilein: ‘M’ rebounding getting better

Even while riding a six-game 

winning streak, John Beilein 
began his press conference with a 
sentiment of trepidation.

“If one team is gonna beat us 

(with offensive rebounding), it’s 
this team,” the Michigan men’s 
basketball coach said last Friday 
before the Wolverines’ matchup 
against Illinois. “They’re really 
strong, and that’s part of their 
offense.”

That fear was justifiable — 

the Fighting Illini frontcourt is 
built on size and an eagerness 
to crash the boards, averaging a 
conference-high 
12.1 
offensive 

rebounds per game.

But 
last 
Saturday, 
the 

Wolverines beat Illinois, partially 
because of their ability to compete 
on the glass.

The Fighting Illini won the 

overall rebounding battle, 31-27, 
and grabbed 10 offensive boards. 
Yet, those numbers demonstrate 
improvement in an area that 
looked like one of Michigan’s 
Achilles’ heels at the beginning of 

the year.

With the losses of Derrick 

Walton Jr., Zak Irvin and D.J. 
Wilson, the Wolverines returned 
just 40 percent of their rebounding 
from a season ago. That showed in 
a November exhibition, when the 
Wolverines allowed 15 offensive 
boards to Grand Valley State — a 
team whose tallest starter is just 
six-foot-eight.

“We can’t let a team, I don’t 

care who they are, get 15 offensive 
rebounds,” said redshirt junior 
guard 
Charles 
Matthews 

afterwards. 
“That 
could 
be 

potentially 
dangerous. 
We’ll 

correct.”

They’ve 
done 
just 
that, 

transforming into one of the 
country’s best on the boards 
statistically, rebounding at a rate 
of 78.4 percent that is good for 
tenth nationally, according to 
teamrankings.com. Last season — 
even with a point guard in Walton 
who was frequently recognized 
for his nose for the ball — the 
Wolverines finished 224nd in 
the category with a rebounding 
percentage rate of 71.9.

“We’ve had some guys become 

so good at boxing out, but for 
whatever reasons we’ve been 
better,” 
Beilein 
said 
Monday. 

“We’ve had some guys stand 
around and could never do it. 
We’ve got some guys who are 
really good at getting in front and 
getting the ball.”

Michigan showed flashes of 

improvement Tuesday in a one-
point loss to Purdue. Despite 
facing two centers over seven 
feet tall in Isaac Haas and Matt 
Haarms, the Wolverines won the 
rebounding margin, 34-29, and 
held the Boilermakers to a below-
average effort on the offensive 
boards.

Still, 
there 
were 
moments 

Tuesday when Michigan was far 
from flawless on the glass.

After 
guard 
Grady 
Eifert 

cleaned up another teammate’s 
miss with around seven minutes 
left in the first half, he found 
guard Dakota Mathias for an open 
corner-3. The shot bounced off the 
rim and just over the fingertips of 
fifth-year senior forward Duncan 
Robinson, allowing Eifert to earn 
his second offensive rebound of 
the possession. Two passes later, 

Mathias took advantage and hit 
the same shot he missed seconds 
before.

Saturday, 
the 
Wolverines 

will need to avoid those plays 
facing a Michigan State team 
with a dominant frontcourt. The 
fourth-ranked Spartans boast the 
country’s second-highest offensive 
rebounding rate of 39.4 percent.

And despite a loss to Ohio 

State and lackluster effort against 
Rutgers this week, Michigan State 
has the talent to soundly defeat 
Michigan. Forward Miles Bridges 
and center Jaren Jackson Jr. are 
expected to be among the top picks 
in this summer’s NBA draft.

Cleaning up on the boards will 

be paramount to the Wolverines’ 
chances of challenging a strong 
frontcourt and nationally-ranked 
opponent for the second time this 
week.

“Playing teams like Purdue 

and Michigan State, it’s tough 
rebounding 
offensively 
and 

defensively,” said senior guard 
Muhammed-Ali Abdur-Rahkman 
on Saturday. “So we’ve got to stick 
to our game plan: box out and want 
the ball.”

Michigan hits the road

Besides 
the 
victory 
itself, 

perhaps the only positive to come 
out of the Michigan women’s 
basketball 
team’s 
win 
over 

Indiana on Wednesday night was 
its rebounding. No matter how 
poor the Wolverines’ defense got 
during their 84-79 win, Michigan 
was buoyed by a 38-18 margin on 
the glass, pulling down as many 
offensive rebounds as the Hoosiers 
did defensive rebounds.

The No. 23 Wolverines (3-2 

Big Ten, 14-4 overall) should win 
on the offensive boards again 
Saturday, as they head to Lincoln 
to face Nebraska (3-1, 12-5). Despite 
strong numbers on the offensive 
glass, the Cornhuskers have just a 
68.1 percent defensive rebounding 
rate, ranking 165th in the country, 
per HerHoopStats.

That could be a recipe for 

disaster against Michigan — a team 
that loves to crash the offensive 
glass, reaching the double-digit 
mark in each of its last eight games.

“We were exploding to the 

ball really well,” said junior 
shooting guard Nicole Munger 
after Wednesday’s game. “For the 
majority of the time, the people 
that were in the triangle did a great 
job of chasing after boards.”

Michigan should also have an 

easy enough time scoring against 
the Cornhuskers. Nebraska gives 
up a middling 64.8 points per game 
on defense and could struggle to 
contain senior guard Katelynn 
Flaherty.

Though Flaherty has struggled 

from beyond the arc of late, she 
has managed to put up over 20 
points in eight straight. Already 
the leading scorer for the Michigan 
women’s program, Flaherty is just 
11 points away from passing Glen 
Rice to become the school’s all-
time leader. Having hit that mark 
in all but one game this season, 
doing so shouldn’t require heavy 
lifting on Saturday.

However, teams have started to 

chip away at Flaherty’s efficiency 

of late by face-guarding her. There 
isn’t much reason to believe the 
Cornhuskers won’t become the 
latest to do so, but at the same time, 
Flaherty is starting to find better 
looks when teams pull that hat out 
of their bags.

“I don’t really think she takes 

very many bad shots anymore,” 
said coach Kim Barnes Arico, “and 
I think she sees the floor and has 
become a better and better passer.”

The next step will be regaining 

her stroke from beyond the arc. 
Since hitting 10 three-pointers 
against Penn State, Flaherty is 
seven of her last 33 from outside. If 
that turns around, the Wolverines 
should win easily.

Defense will be the question 

for Michigan on Saturday. The 
Wolverines have coughed up over 
70 points in three of their last four 
— as many times as they did over 
the season’s first 14 games.

Nebraska’s offense has carried 

the team in its last three games, 
all road victories. Its scoring is 
distributed fairly evenly, with four 
players averaging double-digits. 
However, Hannah Whitish and 
Taylor Kissinger, both guards, 
could be issues for Michigan. The 
two are shooting 38.9 and 38.7 
percent from three, respectively.

Save for an abysmal 61.3 

free 
throw 
percentage, 
the 

Cornhuskers are a potent offense. 
Their 49.2 effective field goal 
percentage is in the 80th percentile 
nationally, their 71.1 points per 
game in the 74th.

The Wolverines will be on 

a relatively short turnaround, 
playing their third game in a week. 
With a trip to Columbus looming 
on Tuesday, however, a loss would 
be a tough pill for Michigan to 
swallow. The Wolverines dropped 
a home game to No. 10 Ohio State 
on Sunday and a win will be tough 
to come by when they face the 
Buckeyes again. A Saturday loss 
could be the precursor to losing 
three of four early in Big Ten play, 
an alarming prospect for a team 
trying to cement itself in the NCAA 
Tournament field.

Junior center Moritz Wagner has been a key part of his team’s improved rebounding, averaging a team-best 7.1 boards per game this season.

disappointing results, why do 

you think this team deserves a top-
five ranking in the polls?

MB: We got a lot of returning 

pieces. We’ve got four starters, we 
have people that 
could have started 
last year returning 
from injury and 
we 
have 
great 

freshmen coming 
in. That’s why you 
come to Michigan 
State, to live out 
those expectations. 
Coach says we’ll 
play 
anybody. 

We play for that 
‘Spartans’ on our chest.

TMD: Last year, you had guys 

like Carmelo Anthony and John 
Wall come to a Michigan State 

game. How does it feel to have 
those type of guys coming to watch 
you play?

MB: That’s two of my favorite 

players, so hopefully they can come 

to another game 
when 
we 
play 

better. It’s crazy. 
I used to talk to 
John Wall a little 
bit when I was 
getting recruited 
by Kentucky. He 
never told me to 
go to Kentucky, 
but he was just 
telling me how 
much he liked me 

as a player.

TTMD: How different should 

we expect your game to look this 
year?

MB: I’m going to be a lot more 

versatile. If I have mismatch in 
the post, I’ll be able to post up. 
Mismatch outside, I’ll be able to use 
my guard skills. My conditioning is 
a lot better, I’ve slimmed down a lot. 
I’m down to 225 (pounds) now. I do 
a lot things better now. I rebound, 
I pass better, I shoot better. Going 
to the ‘3’ spot on the wing is a great 
transition for me.

TMD: Michigan State split the 

rivalry with Michigan last year, 
but the last loss was quite lopsided. 
Is there an added intensity to that 
game this year?

MB: We’re definitely gonna 

play with a chip on our shoulder. I 
wish we would’ve played them at 
their place again this year. We only 
have them at Breslin. It’s gonna be 
a great game between these teams.
