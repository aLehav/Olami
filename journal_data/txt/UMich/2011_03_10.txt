TimSlot : The man on

CFO strikes balance

By KYLE SWANSON
Managing Editor
Many high-profile executives
- individuals who have influ-
ence over multi-billion dollar

corporations - hold high-stakes
meetings throughout the day
and are often unapproachable
by those who don't work direct-
ly with them.
And while the University's
executive vice president and
chief financial officer could eas-
ily fit into this category - hav-
ing wide-ranging responsibility
for a $5.2 billion enterprise -
Timothy Slottow couldn't be
more of an exception.
There's something different

about Slottow, something that
makes it almost impossible to
believe he is one of the most
powerful leaders at a corpora-
tion as large as the University,
unless you see his business card.
From the second he shakes your
hand and greets you with a
hometown smile, he seems too
down to earth for someone in
his position.
But then again, that's not a
bad thing. Not at all.
Whether Slottow's balanced

personality is the result of his
upbringing, diverse work histo-

Mich. scientists challenge
bill's restrictions on EPA

Legislation would
limit agency's
regulations for
Clean Air Act
By JENNA SIMARD
Daily StaffReporter
A recent Congressional bill
that may limit the capabilities of
the Environmental Protection
Agency has a group of university

professors up in arms.
The professors, who are from
various Michigan universi-
ties including the University of
Michigan, Western Michigan
University and Michigan State
University, have banded together
to protest the bill, which seeks
to constrain the EPA's ability to
regulate greenhouse gas emis-
sions, specifically in relation to
the Clean Air Act. The legislation
- called the Energy Tax Preven-
tion Act - was proposed by U.S.
Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), chair

of the U.S. House Committee on
Energy and Commerce, among
others, with the intention to pre-
vent rising energy prices.
In a conference call yester-
day, the professors discussed the
importance of allowing the EPA
to continue its work of regulating
the environment without restric-
tions.
More than 160 scientists,
including numerous University of
Michigan researchers and profes-
sors, also signed a letter to Con-

'U' study reveals increase in prescriptions
of antibiotics for children across the state

Overuse of drugs
can lead to further
health problems
By ZACH BERGSON
For the Daily
The next time you have a
cold, you might want to stop
yourself from reaching for a

Z-Pak.
Antibiotics like the Zithro-
max Z-Pak are used too often
in the state among children and
cause health risks for young
people, a recent University
study found. Despite 15 years of
educational campaigns by the
Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, researchers found
that antibiotic prescriptions
pose more harm than good by

causing antibiotic-resistant
infections and a drain of health
care money and resources.
According to the study
conducted by the University-
funded Center for Healthcare
Research and Transforma-
tion, there was a 4.5-percent
increase among children and
a 9.3-percent decrease among
adults who were prescribed

House GOP says federal

House Repbulicans
argue statistics,
call for pay cuts
WASHINGTON (AP) -
While conservative GOP gover-
nors are demanding concessions
from state workers, House
Republicans are making federal
employees the next target.
Republicans at a House hear-
ing on yesterday complained
that the 2.1 million-strong fed-
eral work force is overpaid
compared with workers holding
similar jobs in the private sec-
tor.
The personnel chief for fed-
eral workers cried foul. He said
many federal employees earn
too little.
Competing witnesses and
House members threw out one
statistic after another to fit their
descriptions of an overpaid or
underpaid government work
force. In a larger sense, the
hearing was part of Republican

demands for cutbacks in Obama
administration programs and
spending.
On the wall directly behind
Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massa-
chusetts, the ranking Democrat
on the House Oversight and Gov-
ernment Reform panel, major-
ity Republicans had erected a
large poster saying: "Employ-
ment Changes December
2008-December 2010; Private
Sector Jobs -8,817,000; federal
government jobs +157,000."
A sign next to it said: "2010
Average Total Compensation;
Government Worker $101,628;
Private Worker $60,000."
John Berry, director of the
Officeof PersonnelManagement,
said President Barack Obama
has frozen annual pay increases
for two years. Before Obama
took office, he said, government
employees received raises "in
virtual lock step with the private
sector labor market regardless of
who controlled Congress or the
White House."
Berry said many federal work-

ers are underpaid and many com-
parisons are phony. He noted
the government doesn't employ
retail clerks, waiters, short
order cooks or other specialties
whose salaries are included in
pay comparisons. The few cooks
employed usually work in pris-
ons and have responsibility over
inmates, he said.
Panel chairman Dennis Ross,
R-Fla., cited Office of Personnel
Management numbers showing
the average salary for federal
employees was $74,311 in 2010.
He then referred to an analysis
by the Cato Institute think tank
showing the average private
sector worker earned $50,462.
Those numbers did not include
total compensation.
"The federal government also
pays an average of 36 percent
of employees' base pay health
insurance and pension benefits,
in addition to generous paid
leave. Taken together, federal
employees on average earned
$101,628 in total compensation in
2010," he said.

Army opens fire on
protesters calling
for Saleh to resign
SANAA, Yemen (AP) - Thou-
sands of Yemenis defiantly demon-
strated yesterday at a public square,
a day afterthe army stormed Sanaa
University, firing live ammunition,
killing one person and wounding
scores of others.
The attack escalated tensions

in Yemen, which has been rocked
by weeks of protests against Presi-
dent Ali Abdullah Saleh, a key U.S.
ally in the campaign against al-
Qaida who has been in power 32
years.
Abdullah al-Jeifi, 24, died and
several other protesters who were
shot in Tuesday's raid were in seri-
ous condition, said Mohammed
al-Abahi, one of the doctors vol-
unteering at the Sanaa University
campus. Soldiers also used rub-
ber bullets and tear gas in their

assault.
Outraged at the government
raid, more protesters camped out
in tents near the university and on
campus Wednesday. A group of
young protesters issued a "black
list" with the names of 13 officials
they say are responsible for the
violence against peaceful protest-
ers. The names include the son of
President Ali Abdullah Saleh who
heads the Republican Guards, the
interior minister and other top
security officials.

Snyder: Residents
must think about
'we,' not 'me'
Michigan citizens need to
think about what's best for every-
one rather than just themselves if
the state is to reinvent itself, Gov.
Rick Snyder told the Michigan
Association of Broadcasters yes-
terday.
The Republican governor
defended his nearly $2 billion in
business tax cuts and the income
tax changes he wants to make to
offset that, including a tax on pen-
sions that has drawn criticism.
People naturally object to
changes that affect their bottom
line, he said. But residents need to
think not just about their current
circumstances, but what changes
will make Michigan a better place
for their children and grandchil-
dren, he added.
"In our hearts, we know it's
time for 'we' to happen," he said
at the end of a half-hour speech.
"By following through on that
'we' attitude, we'll have an excit-
ing future."
The state is facing an esti-
mated $1.4 billion shortfall in the
upcoming budget year that begins
Oct. 1.
WASHINGTON
a House counsel to
defend ban on gay
marriage in court
House Speaker John Boehner
says the House counsel will
defendthe federalbanongaymar-
riage, now that the Obama admin-
istration won't.
A five-member House panel
yesterday voted 3-2 along party
lines to direct the House counsel
to come up with a legal defense for
the 1996 law. The Obama admin-
istration has directed the Justice
Department to stop defending
the law in court because, White
House officials believe, it is uncon-
stitutional.
Boehner said the law's consti-
tutionality should be decided by a
court, not by the president. Mean-
while, House Democratic leader
Nancy Pelosi, who voted against
the directive, says the defense will
be lengthy and expensive.
NEW YORK
N.Y. fire engine

New York City police say a van
full of special needs adults and a

personinthe van and injuringsev-
eral others, two of them seriously.
At least seven people from
the van were taken to a hospital,
including one critical and one seri-
ous injury. The victim who died
was in the van and has not been
identified.
Six firefighters suffered minor
injuries.

The fire engine, from Ladder
81, was driving through a Staten
Island intersection when it hit the
van's rear driver-side door as it
made a left turn, police said.

Chaos deepens as

Clashes between Muslims
and Christians in Egypt left 13
dead and 140 wounded, deepen-
ing a sense of chaos as the police
and ruling military struggled to
maintain order barely a month
after a popular uprising ousted
longtime leader Hosni Mubarak.
In a sign of how much security
has broken down, the pitched
battles - the deadliest in years
- went on for nearly four hours
Tuesday night as both sides
fought with guns, knives and
clubs. Army troops fired in the
air to disperse the crowds to no
avail.
The new Cabinet sought to
reassure Egyptians yesterday
night, ordering police to imme-
diately take back the streets.

Slottow not the average University executive

From Page 1A
'WE MAKE BLUE GO'
With Slottow's title as execu-
tive vice president and CFO, it's
easy to think of him as the Uni-
versity's top accountant. And
while that may be true for Slot-
tow's role as CFO, being one of
three executive vice presidents
at the University means his
responsibility is much more far-
reaching.
Slottow's fellow executive
vice presidents are Philip Han-
lon, the University's provost who
oversees all academic opera-
tions at the University, and Ora
Pescovitz, the executive vice
president of medical affairs who
is in charge of the University of
Michigan Health System and
other medical enterprises at
the University like the Medical
School. Slottow is in charge of
everything else.
Collectively, Slottow's areas
of responsibility are commonly
called business and finance. This
includes thousands of Univer-
sity employees who help to sup-
port the work conducted by the
University faculty and students
in the medical and academic
spheres.
Without the business and
finance group, campus would
look dramatically different.Com-
puter labs would not exist, and no
University employee would have
a computer at his or her desk. But
that wouldn't matter, since build-
ings wouldn't be powered or
cleaned, and employees wouldn't
be paid for their work. That's
because the University's busi-
ness and finance division handles
essentially all non-academic and
non-medical tasks at the Uni-
versity, including building con-
struction and maintenance,
information technology services,
investment management and
human resources operations.
THE 'TYPICAL' DAY
Asked to describe his typi-
cal day at work, Slottow simply
replies, "There is not a typical
day. It just doesn't exist."
There's no such thing as a nor-
mal day for Slottow because he's
is involved in so many aspects of
the University's operations. His
attention is called in many dif-
ferent directions that repeating
a day would be almost unfath-
omable. However, the structure
of Slottow's days is often very
similar.
A gymnast during his time as
an undergraduate student at the
University of California-Berke-
ley, Slottow remains physically
active, often waking up by 5:30
in the morning so he has time to
hit the gym before heading to the
office.
But once Slottow reaches his
office on the third floor of the
Fleming Administration Build-
ing, his day disappears quickly.
Often scheduled with back-to-
back meetings for the entire day,
Slottow's schedule doesn't leave
much time for working on tasks
he must complete on his own
- including reviewing finan-
cial statements and reports and
responding to e-mails.
To help him focus on some of
his more complex tasks, Slottow

says he sometimes delays arriv-
ing to the office in the morning,
instead opting to escape to a local
coffee shop to avoid the inevita-
ble distractions that can arise at

his office.
"I'll basically go, like when I
was a student, to a coffee shop
or somewhere just to not be any-
where near the phone or near the
inbox if I really have to focus on
something," Slottow said in an
interview with The Michigan
Daily.
But even those early morn-
ing escapes don't give Slottow
enough time to catch up on the
work that piles up on his desk or
the e-mails that flood his inbox.
To complete these tasks, Slot-
tow takes work home with him
at night and often responds to
messages long after many others
in Fleming have left for the night.
BALANCING WORK AND
FAMILY
Though he works long work
hours and is never truly being
"off-the-clock," Slottow is a fam-
ily man. It may be difficult at
times for him to spend as much
time as he might want to with his
children - all of whom are now
in college - or his wife, but it's
clear he has found a way to make
everything work.
Sitting in his office during an
interview, Slottow shows off pic-
tures of his children displayed
on his desk. They're a little out-
of-date now, he admits, proudly
sharing what each child is doing
now.
His eldest daughter is a gradu-
ate of the University's School
of Music, Theatre & Dance and
is now pursuing her master's
degree at the University of Texas
at Austin. His son is an Engineer-
ing junior at the University of
Michigan and an active member
of the Parkour Club on campus.
And Slottow's youngest daughter
is pursuing her bachelor's degree
at a small music college in St.
Paul, Minn.
Though their academic
endeavors may separate Slottow
from seeing his children as much
as he would like, it's clear Slot-
tow makes every effort to spend
time with his kids - even if it's
just swinging by Zingerman's
Deli between meetings to have a
quick lunch with his son.
Having celebrated his silver
anniversary last summer, Slot-
tow is also very devoted to his
wife, who is a reconnective heal-
ing practitioner, an artist and a
competitive ballroom dancer.
But Slottow's wife isn't the
only one with a dancing gene.
Slottow enjoys spending some
time on the dance floor too. The
proof is on YouTube, where

Other symbols of the essen-
tial work done by the business
and finance groups are scattered
throughout Slottow's office. On
the circular, four-person confer-
ence table that sits in Slottow's
office, between his desk and a
small seating area, is a special set
of coasters.
With the Michigan 'M' proud-
ly emblazoned on each of the
four coasters, Slottow explains
that the set was a gift from
Lewis Morgenstern, a Univer-
sity professor of neurology and
neurosurgery and director of
the University Hospital's stroke
program.
Morgenstern served on a
faculty committee that advises
Slottow on business and finance
matters affecting faculty when
he decided to take a sabbatical
from his post at UMHS to work
for Slottow's office in what Slot-
tow described as "an intern, a
grunt" position.
But after working with the
business and finance division of
the University, Morgenstern's
career path changed slightly. He
has since written a script for a
movie that describes the role of
the business and finance division
at the University and now has a
partial appointment in the Uni-
versity's Office of the Provost.
Slottow also keeps things in
his office that clearly demon-
strate how much he values the
people who work for his orga-
nization. Walking around in his
office, Slottow points to a poster
hanging near the door. It's a post-
er that displays what are suppos-
edly the best movie quotes of all
time.
It looks of out place, but Slot-
tow explains it was something
his assistant bought him because
one of the people Slottow cor-
responds with likes to include
movie quotes in his messages.
The poster, Slottow says, allows
him to build a better relationship
with this person and to take part
in the fun exchanges.
Slottow takes great care to
make people feel valued, espe-
cially by making time to listen to
feedback from his staff. Through
informal, off-the-record conver-
sations with cross-sections of his
division called "pulse checks,"
Slottow hears directly from all
members of his staff about what
issues employees are facing so he
can stay in the loop.
It's perhaps unusual for an
executive at Slottow's level to
meet with employees who range
from custodians to his boss,
University President Mary Sue
Coleman, and the University
Board of Regents. But it's what
makes Slottow the leader he is.
He doesn't settle for anything
less than what's best for the Uni-
versity. He can't. He cares too
much to give anything less than
his best.

A MATTER-OF-FACT MAN
Between balancing his fam-
ily and his wide range of work
responsibilities, Slottow's
attention may be stretched
thin. It is impossible for him to
spend as'much time with each
business unit, family member
or hobby as he might like, but
his focus on results is some-
thing that drives his success.
A self-described "fact-
based, data-driven" man, Slot-
tow's past as a consultant and
his financial work for both
Amtrak and the city of Seat-
tle have shaped his rational
approach to ensuring decisions
are made with the best interest

Federal gov. needs to finally close Guantanamo
Since its establishment under the Bush administration in 2002,
the prison at Guantanamo Bay has been part of a distress-
ing chapter in American history, rife with allegations and
accounts of prisoner abuse and torture. The prison was established
as an indefinite detention facility and housed those designated as
"enemy combatants," who - according to the Bush administration
- were outside the bounds of the law and not entitled to protection
under the Geneva Convention or legal recourse to challenge their
detention. Lawsuits on behalf of the detainees eventually reached
the U.S. Supreme Court, which has repeatedly ruled in their favor by
granting prisoners the rights of habeas corpus and exposing proce-
dural flaws in military tribunals constructed under Bush that made
neutral arbitration impossible.

I've finally got a SUGIYAMA
lead.
If you think
that my bold accusations are a little
unwarranted, it's because they are.
And since you could so easily distin-
guish my baseless claims from fact,
you probably won't have a problem
with a similar hyperbole reported in
the March 2 Sports Illustrated which
revealed results from its study called
"College Football and Crime."
SI and CBS News conducted an
"unprecedented six-month investi-
gation" of college football players'
criminal history and reported their
findings last week. The 2,837 play-
ers in question were members of SI's
Preseason Top 25 football programs.
After checking the backgrounds of
the players, SI found that 7 percent of
the players "had been charged with
or cited for a crime" and nearly 60
percent were convicted. The crimes
include theft, property destruction,
drug possession and others.
The numbers presented weren't
what struck me as surprising, but
rather the way in which the infor-
mation was presented. It was odd
that SI gave a few anecdotes about
students who had committed
crimes and then generalized that
information to the entire football
community. Stories of armed rob-
bery and aggravated assault con-
stituted a great deal of the report.
These tales were the crux of SI's
argument that crime is rampant in
college football, and the programs
could care less. While these stories
are by no means the whole picture,
without them there isn't much in
this study that warrants a multiple

page spread in the magazine, let
alone the cover.
Though they're presented as
alarming, the statistics are less than
shocking. When comparedto Oregon
State University's Daily Barometer
study about crimes committed by all
college students, they're downright
placid. About 3.5 percent of all col-
lege students - and I'm rounding
up from 3.45 percent, a liberty that
echoes throughout SI's study - have
previously committed a crime. When
considering the sample size of SI's
study compared to that of the Daily
Barometer's, it becomes apparent
that this 0.05 percent difference in
convictions between football play-
ers and other students isn't all that
significant. SI's smaller sample popu-
lation means that statistics are more
susceptible to outliers, which can
skew the results.
No study is perfect, and sam-
pling the entire population of play-
ers would require about five times
as much research as was done by SI.
Perhaps the key to understanding
the true irrelevance of SI's report is
that it didn't "have access to juvenile
arrest records forroughly 80 percent
of the players in the study." Wait -
what? The statistics of a study that
made claims about 25 college foot-
ball teams were extrapolated from
only 20 percent of their claimed data
pool. After reading this disclaimer -
which was one of many - my opin-
ion of SI's reporting methods took a
stark turn.
SI criticized football programs
for not checking the criminal
records of their recruits - infor-
mation that it wasn't able to access
because juvenile records aren't
publicly available - stating that
none of the 25 teams require a
background check on their pro-
spective student-athletes. Some of
the coaches were asked why they
don't do more research on their
recruits. Many answered with a
not-so-far-from-the-truth response
of not "know(ing) that juvenile
records were available." Because
they aren't. SI is apparently a fan
of snipe hunting for background
EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS:

SI's intentions were noble, and
I have no problem with this study
being done. What I find problem-
atic is how it took vanilla results
and turned them into a scandal for
the ages. It's not fair to cast such a
villainous light on college football
players because you find a couple of
malevolent anecdotes.
Crime study of
student-athletes
is misleading.
If anyone should be upset, it's the
players. Though they're often ste-
reotyped as thuggish brutes, the vast
majority are college kids who are no
more inclined to commit crime than
a member of a fraternity or an honor
society.
I hope that SI realizes its error in
judgment and republishes this study
in its "Go Figure" section of the
Scorecard. I'll even give a couple of
suggestions for the headings:
7
Percent of college football players
we made out to be criminals in the SI
study.
4

committed a crime.

There was reason for optimism when Presi-
dent Barack Obama was elected. He prom-
ised to close the prison by January 2010 and
took tangible steps toward that goal. Notably,
the administration halted military trials in
2009 and attempted later that year to transfer
detainees to the United States for civilian tri-
als, which failed because it didn't receive fund-
ing from the U.S. Senate. But now we're several
months into 2011, and Guantanamo's closure
looks to be a broken promise, as Obama has
retreated in face of political opposition. In a
disappointing action on Monday, he issued an
executive order to resume military tribunals.
It's important to remember that the Obama
administration has handled the situation much
better than its predecessors. New military tri-
bunal procedures require a periodical review
of prisoners' status and ensure that defendants
have access to legal couJlyeb, Additionally,
Obama has promised to adhere to the Geneva
Convention.
But these changes are stop gap measures
that don't address structural problems with the
Guantanamo Bay prison. Though the revised
procedures may seem fair in theory, they are
still prone to abuse. In the end, representatives
of the executive branch may use their discre-
tion to decide whether a prisoner may be indef-
initely detained - this is hardly equivalent to

due process. Not only is this procedure unfair,
it's unnecessary. So far, the one criminal tried
in civilian court - Ahmed Ghailani - was con-
victed on a conspiracy charge and sentenced
to life in prison despite the exclusion of a key
witness whose identity was ascertained by tor-
ture. At a fundamental level, criminal prosecu-
tion of detainees affirms our faith in the rule
of law and must, at the very least, be given the
chance to work on a consistent basis.
The blame can't fall solely on the Obama
administration, which has faced logistical and
political obstacles in its attempts to try pris-
oners in the American legal system. Obama
has faced opposition from Congress and the
media in his attempts to try detainees in civil-
ian courts. This needs to end. The damage
done to America's reputation - in the form of
international criticism and increased terror-
ism recruitment - by keeping Guantanamo
fBay open far outweighs any potential security
threats from housing terrorists in maximum-
security U.S. prisons.
Though the administration reiterated its
promise this week to eventually close the
Guantanamo Bay prison, this has to be taken
with a grain of salt. Obama needs to show that
he's actually committed to this goal, and there
must be a cooperative effort to close the deten-
tion facility as quickly as possible.

MELANIE KRUVELIS I
A step from the edge

So, spring break. Pretty crazy, huh? Not that
I really remember what happened, of course.
Somewhere between listening to Jewel on
repeat and waiting for the phone to ring, I sort
of lost track of everything.
Well, anyway, it sure is good to be back at
school. You know, back to lonely nights in the
library, sitting by yourself in the cafeteria, and
above all, being united with 40,000 students
by a single phenomenon - bacne. Erm, wait - I
mean stress. Partially due to a physics experi-
ment gone terribly awry, the academic pres-
sure is back on. Luckily, a recent New York
Times article explained that it isn't just those
of us here at the University who are feeling
overwhelmed. According to the Jan. 26 article
titled "Record Level of Stress Found in College
Freshmen," the emotional health of incoming
students has dropped to the lowest level in the
last 25 years.
What's really concerning isn't the fact that
an entire generation is sinking further and
further into a seemingly endless depression
with rampant abuse of prescription drugs
spreading faster than STDs within the cast of
"Jersey Shore." Nah, that's not really a big deal
- certainly not worth investigating anyway.
The real issue? No one seems to know pre-
cisely why this nation's college students are
huffing paint chips. "We don't know exactly
why students' emotional health is declining,"
John Pryor, a research program director at
University of California, Los Angeles's Higher
Education Research Institute, told The New
York Times.
Well, I don't know about you - hey, maybe
we should change that, perhaps over dinner
later? No, wait, the generational depression
thing. Right. It's all over campus - walking
through Angell Hall on a Monday morning is
like navigating through a crowd of hungover
Eeyores. The point is we must ask ourselves
- why are we so stressed? What's the cause
of this widespread unhappiness? And how
quickly can we deport all these 'depresshmen'
to Ohio?
The most obvious answer to this perma-
nent state of gloom and doom is, of course,
MTV's remake of "Skins." It was an innocent

enough idea - a chance for American tele-
vision producers to once again capitalize on
British brilliance, replacing dry humor with
Nascar jokes and cracks about fast food. But
unlike successful remakes of shows like "The
Office," "Skins" is one of those trainwrecks
you don't actually wantto watch at all, but are
forced to because your roommate bought the
TV. And after being in the room for the first
five episodes of the show, I completely under-
stand why American college students are one
step away from jumping off that ledge. We
suck at the one thing we're supposed to be
good at - television. Without the accents and
strange British euphemisms, the show really
just became a pornographic circus of nipple
talk and smoking pot off someone's nipples,
which I didn't think was possible. As a direct
result, everyone hates America, and we're
forced to deal with it.
It could be Charlie Sheen too. For years, it's
been pretty obvious that dear Charlie is the
man - if his acting on "Two and a Half Men"
doesn't scream brilliant, I don't know what
does. But in recent weeks, Sheen has gone from
that wacky uncle with drug problems to that
wacky uncle who snorts cocaine off the tur-
key at Thanksgiving dinner - and by turkey, I
mean porn stars. It's hard for college students
to live up to the standards set by one of the
highest paid actors on television - how can we
possibly be happy with ourselves as we watch
Sheen calmly explain on CNN that he has "a
10,000-year-old brain and the boogers of a 7
year old?" It just isn't fair.
We may never know the real answer as to
why we're so stressed. Maybe it's Miley Cyrus
hosting "SNL." Perhaps it's the straight-to-
DVD release of "Mean Girls 2." Or maybe it's
the fact that today's college students face high
unemployment rates and skyrocketing tuition
prices - not to mention climate change, world-
wide civil unrest, costly wars, obesity, rising
threats of terrorism...
Sigh. But really, did you see Miley? Her
impression of Lindsay Lohan? God, talk
about depressing.

In Daniel Luks's world (In Defense ofIsrael, 1/24/2011),
the Jewish state can do no wrong, and when it rarely ever
does, there's always a darn good reason for it. He asserts
that as the only democracy in the Middle East, it stands
for peace, justice and equality, having extended the hand
of friendship to the Palestinians on countless occasions
only to be rebuffed every time. Luks's arguments, how-
ever, are fallacious and illogical, and collapse under the
weight of scrutiny.
The Palestinian Authority has insisted on the ces-
sation of settlement construction activity in the West
Bank and East Jerusalem and on the pre-1967 borders
as being the basis of all further talks. Luks contends that
these preconditions are unreasonable, and Prime Min-
ister Benjamin Netanyahu would agree. But if you and I
are fighting over a piece of real estate and we are going
through an arbitration process, should I be allowed to
build on that land and consequently change its charac-
ter? Furthermore, the entire world community, through
United Nations resolutions as well as through unilateral
action, has recognized the pre-1967 borders as the basis
for a future Palestinian state. What would the Israelis
consider a good starting point? The new boundary creat-
ed by the Apartheid Wall, which is four times as long and
twice as high as the Berlin Wall, and cuts through villag-
es in the West Bank, separating farmers from their fields?
What's more, the recently leaked Palestine Papers reveal
the extent to which the Palestinian leadership was will-
ing to go to reach a political settlement, only to receive
nothing in return from the Israelis. So who's really being
unreasonable here?
Luks then discusses the conduct of Israel's neigh-
bors and how the country's track record is just stellar
when pitted against those of the oppressive and intol-
erant regimes that surround it. First, there is a very
good reason why there are more dictators than elected
leaders in that part of the world, and it has much to do
with U.S. foreign policy in the region over the last half
century, but I won't get into that here. Nonetheless-it
is highly disingenuous of Luks to compare Israel to the
dictatorial arrangements that it shares borders with. Of
course the democracy, however flawed, will fair better!
What he should be comparing Israel to are modern lib-
eral democracies, and not to the world's biggest human
rights offenders such as Mubarak-era Egypt and pres-
ent-day Saudi Arabia. And when the appropriate com-
parisons are made, it is clear that Israel's record is just

absolutely dismal.
Luks is right: Israel is not perfect. In fact, it has deep
structural problems. Even if one were to forget about its
conduct abroad, including its offer to provide apartheid
South Africa six Jericho missiles tipped with nuclear
warheads, its use of white phosphorus and human shields
during 2008 Operation Cast Lead - which resulted in the
massacre of 1,400 Gazans - its illegal blockade of Gaza,
its illegal settlements in the West Bank, its silencing of
the growing peaceful protest movement in the Occu-
pied areas, the presence of Jewish-only roads in the
West Bank, and so on and so forth, it is hard to ignore
the direction the country is taking. From rabbis issuing
statements asking Jews not to sell property to non-Jews,
to the wives of certain rabbis telling Jewish girls not to
date Arab boys, from expulsion of its only Arab student
by a school in Sulam, northern Israel, at the behest of a
group of Jewish parents to the Central Elections Com-
mittee banning Arab parties from running in the 2009
parliamentary elections, Israel has steadily been moving
to the right. And with extremists hijacking deliberations
in the Knesset regarding the settlements, the mere men-
tion of dismantling those settlements in the future now
amounts to political suicide.
And to boot, criticism of Israel's actions is summarily
dismissed as either the ravings of "self-hating Jews" or
the unbridled propaganda of anti-Semites, whose ranks
would probably boast such renowned peace activists as
Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu and Jimmy Carter, all
of whom have spoken out against Israel's occupation of
the West Bank and its treatment of the Palestinians. And
I wonder what they would make of the revered Mahat-
ma Gandhi, who rejected Zionism and did not support
the creation of Israel, even though he sympathized with
the plight of the Jews. Would he also be considered an
anti-Semite? The conclusions of United Nations fact-
finding commissions, Amnesty International, B'Tselem
and other concerned organizations are almost invariably
labeled "biased" and "one-sided." I am all too familiar
with this flawed and dangerous outlook, this convenient
deflection of criticism, having come from a country
where people find it expedient to off-handedly explain
all of Pakistan's woes with conspiracy theories involving
India, Israel and the United States. You see, it's never us;
it's always everyone else.

The study also found that five
of the 10 most commonly pre-
scribed antibiotics were "anti-
biotics of concern" - drugs
like Zithromax and Augmen-
tin - that treat many types of
bacteria, but can create antibi-
otic resistance within patients if
misused.
Blue Cross Blue Shield of
Michigan - Michigan's larg-
est health care provider and a
partner supporting the Center

data on adults and children ana-

The study reports that anti-
biotics, while useful in fighting
bacterial infections, do little
to cure viral infections such as
bronchitis and the common
cold. In addition, "antibiotics
of concern" or "broad spectrum
antibiotics" are only intended
to treat patients with infections
who haven't responded to other
antibiotics, according to the
study.

Independently organized
and targeted specifically for a
University audience, this year's
TEDxUofM event will bring

tioned illnesses, more than $20
billion in excess health care
costs in the U.S. have been used
as a consequence to treat preva-
lent antibiotic-resistant infec-
tions.
Despite these side effects,
the study found that nearly half
of the antibiotics prescribed
in Michigan were classified as
"broad spectrum antibiotics."
A geographic analysis of
Michigan found that children
and adult prescription rates
were higher in regions outside of
Southeast Michigan, especially
in regions in the Upper Peninsu-
la, Northern areas in the Lower
Peninsula and along the state's
Ohio border. The study points
to differences in education as an
explanation for this disparity.
Southeast Michigan may
have a lower child prescription
rate than other areas in the state
because it has a higher concen-
tration of pediatricians, who
were specifically targeted by
campaigns to reduce antibiotic
overuse, according to the study.
Heather Holmstrom, a clini-
cal lecturer in medicine at the
University's Medical School,
said she feels most doctors,

Perhaps the most well known
of the presenters is School of Art

Polar Express," wrote and illus-
trated the book "Jumanji."
Prospective speakers either
apply or are sought by TEDx
organizers. A group of 40 stu-

best lineup of presenters.
Engineering junior Laura
Willming, a member of the
TEDx marketing team, said the
success of last year's conference
on campus is one of the reasons
she got involved with the proj-
ect.
"The passion and stories that
come from the TEDx stage are
what drew me to it," Willming
said. "The idea of people from all
walks of life coming together is
one of the greatest parts of the
TED brand in general."
TEDxUofM also includes stu-
dent presenters. LSA and School

is studying physics and cello
performance, will speak about
her senior thesis on the relation-
ship between auditory feedback

She said a doctor's background T
and colleagues have a larger f
influence on how they prescribe a
antibiotics than his or her area ti
of expertise.
"It's not based on what spe- tc

training and philosophy, and ti
whether they have the support c

whether they have pressure to o

The recession might have
caused an increase in antibi- o

added, because many unem- a

to change their health care d

"Because of the economy, C
people are getting care from a
lots of different providers and
maybe don't have the ability to a

Holmstrom added that alter- p

Huberth said.
She added that she thinks she
was chosen to speak at the event
because of her work in "what
seems to be, at first glance, two
unrelated fields."
Due to the high level of inter-
est, prospective event attendees
are required to apply before-
hand. Last year's TEDx show-
case which was held at the
Biomedical Science Research
Building had about 350 people
in attendance but received about
600 applicants. To accommo-
date a bigger audience this year,
the event organizers sought a
larger venue - the Michigan
Theater.
In the coming weeks, the
TEDxUofM team will announce
the rest of the event's speakers.
Willming said she hopes the
event will inspire participants.
"This event will hopefully
give innovators and creators
that spark of passion and excite-
ment they need to bring their
visions to life," she said.

"Giving people resources A
o other types of care - for M
xample, saline nasal irriga-
ion works really well but is not is
ommonly known," Holmstrom th
aid. "I think education about er
ther ways that people can help sa

In terms of further research

But even with more education at

he thinks it will take a number Cl
f years to significantly alter th

"For many, many years people en

EPA
From Page 1A
gress as of yesterday afternoon,
asking Michigan's congressmen
to support the EPA and oppose
any further attempts to under-
mine its authority.
The panel of scientists speak-
ing during the conference call
included Howard Lerner, an
adjunct clinical assistant profes-
sor of psychology in the Universi-
ty's Medical School and president
and executive director of the
Environmental Law and Policy
Center - a Midwestern think
tank.
Lerner said a multidisciplinary
group of scientists have signed
the letter so far because they
believe actions should be taken to
"reduce greenhouse gas pollution
and protect public health."
"The 160 scientists that signed
the letter that we have distributed
today are urging Congress to not
support any measure that would
weaken the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency," Lerner said.
"The EPA has a responsibility
to do its job and do its job well,
implementing and applying the
Clean Air Acts standards, and
Congress must let the EPA do its
job."
However, a March 4 press
release from Upton's office states
that the intent of the bill is to pre-
vent the EPA's climate change
efforts from skyrocketing energy
costs forAmericans.
"Whether at the pump or on

mericans in the coming months,c
odi said.t
"The belief here, quite frankly, i
that young Americans today are
e most innovative, creative gen-r
ation that we've ever seen," Modi i
id. "You guys have inherited j
credible challenges, and you'vea
et them with really inspiringc
lutions."
Earlier efforts by the adminis-p
ation to connect with Americant
iuth include a trip to Cleveland,v
hio where officials hosted anc
ent last month that included ar
sit from Obama.t
Justin Pierce, executive direc-
r of undergraduate student gov- f
nment at Kent State University,c
tended the event along with stu-c
nt and business leaders in thet
leveland area. Pierce said duringd
e conference call that it was "ay
ry productive meeting," and aftert
e event, Obama hosted a confer-t
ice call with the students to con-
nue talking about topics discussede
the roundtable.
"I was so honored to have hada
e chance to participate in a i
undtable with other young lead-a
s," Pierce said. "It was an incred-c
their monthly utility bills, Ameri-
can families, farmers and employ-
ers feel the pinch when energy
prices go up," Upton wrote in the
press release. "The very last thing
the federal government should do
is make matters worse by inten-
tionally driving up the cost of
energy. Yet that is exactly what's
in store if the EPA moves forward
with its plans to regulate and
penalize carbon emissions under
the Clean Air Act."
The proposed law states that it
is "a bill to amend the Clean Air
Act to prohibit the Administra-
tor of the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency from promulgating
any regulation concerning, taking
action relating to, or taking into
consideration the emission of a
greenhouse gas to address climate
change, and for other purposes."
A recent EPA report projecting
the benefits of the Clean Air Act
revealed that the law will enable
a cost-savings of $2 trillion by
2020 and will save 230,000 peo-
ple's lives each year, according to
a press release issued yesterday
from the group of scientists.
But the press release from
Upton's office states that the pro-
posed legislation would simply
"clarify" the EPA's role in regard
to the Clean Air Act, "preserving
the law's important and long-
standing functions to reduce air
pollution."
Knute Nadelhoffer, a professor
of ecology and evolutionary biol-
ogy at the University and direc-
tor of the LSA Biological Station,
also participated in the call and

ible and unforgettable experience
to meet and talk with President
Obama."
Since the roundtable, Pierce said
he has discussed the initiative with
other students and made an effort
to help his peers become more
nvolved in national issues.
"Our generation sees a lot of
negativity, and a lot of times we're
ntimidated by it," Pierce said. "We
ust need to become more informed
and engaged, and this is the perfect
opportunity to do that."
While the administration sug-
gests for a roundtable to include 10
to 15 participants for optimal con-
versation and productivity, groups
of any size can be submitted to
request attendance by an official or
to get feedback.
LSA junior Brendan Campbell,
former chair of the University's
chapter of College Democrats and
current MForward vice presiden-
tial candidate for the Michigan Stu-
dent Assembly, said in an interview
yesterday that he is looking forward
to the prospect of hosting a round-
table on campus.
"I think this is an incredible
opportunity," Campbell said. "We
knowyoungpeople havegreatideas
about where our country is headed
n the coming decade. I'm excited
about creating forums where we
can discuss these issues."
discussed his recent testimony
before the U.S. House of Repre-
sentatives Committee on Energy
and Commerce about the science
behind greenhouse gas pollution.
He explained why the EPA should
be allowed to continue its goal to
keep American citizens safe from
toxic air contaminants.
"We as Michigan scientists and
researchers are coming together
to send a clear message to Con-
gress", Nadelhoffer said during
the conference call. "The EPA
has been instrumental in protect-
ing Michigan's natural resources
from greenhouse gas emissions
using proven science facts, not
politics, and we stress that this is
not a political topic. This is a sci-
ence-based enterprise that we're
on."
According to the press release
from the scientists, the EPA
makes environmental strides, as
well as economic ones. In the let-
ter,the Michigan scientists drew
attention to the fact that having
clean air regulations can lead to
more than 62,300 jobs in the state
in the next five years.
"Federal policies aimed at
reducing greenhouse gas buildup
in the atmosphere provide oppor-
tunities to protect Michigan's
valuable natural resources and
stimulate our economy," the letter
states. "Importantly, we believe
that the benefits to Michigan will
likely far exceed the costs."

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com 0

Mattison draws from experience with Ravens
By TIM ROHAN built at stops at Notre Dame and March 19. While the offense said. "The reason Ed Reed is the
Daily Sports Editor Florida and in the past two sea- wrestles with learning a pro- best safety in the NFL, is not
sons as the defensive coordinator style attack, Mattison will be just because he's a great athlete,

Just the sight of Bo Schem-
bechler would make Greg Mat-
tison giddy.
When Mattison was the
defensive coordinator at Michi-
gan from 1995-96, Schembechler
was the athletic director and his
office was right down the hall
from Mattison's. Sometimes,
when Mattison would go into
the copy room to print off items
for the defense, Schembechler
would see him and follow him
into the room.
"I would be scared to death,
and he'd go, 'Hey Mattison,
you're doin a helluva job. Keep
stopping that run,' " Mattison
said in his best Bo impersonation
on Wednesday afternoon.
And that's when Mattison
would melt.
"And I was like, 'Oh God, Bo
just talked to me. And he gave me
a compliment,' "he said.
Now in his second go-around
as Michigan's defensive coor-
dinator, the trademarks of his
defenses have remained the
same - stop the run by being
aggressive.
That's the reputation he has

of the Baltimore Ravens. Leaving
one of the best defensive teams
in the NFL for Michigan was a
product of a perfect combination
for Mattison - coaching with
Brady Hoke and becoming a Wol-
verine again.
Mattison explained Wednes-
day that he and his wife were
very close to Hoke and his family
- as close as they could be with-
out actually being family.
"When Brady got the job and
it was Michigan - I honestly can
say if Brady would've got another
job somewhere else, and it wasn't
Michigan, I probably wouldn't
have done it," Mattison said.
"But the chance to come back
here, and to be with him, made it
special."
At the college level, Mattison
has the opportunity not only to
recruit again, but also develop
recruits into great players. As
Mattison put it, in the NFL, if a
player wasn't any good, he was
cut. In college, Mattison has the
time to mold players.
There will be plenty of mold-
ing expected when Michigan
starts its spring practices on

prepping his players to take on
a tough approach in their new
four-man front defense.
So far, all Mattison has been
allowed to do is see what the
defensive players can do in
t-shirts and shorts, though he
was reluctant to pass judgment
on any player until he saw them
hit. In fact, he didn't even watch
film of last season to avoid unfair
misconceptions.
Instead, Mattison pops in tape
of his Baltimore Ravens teams to
break down.
The terminology is the same
that he will use in coaching the
Wolverines now.
And, as teaching tools for his
Michigan guys, Mattison can use
Ray Lewis and Ed Reed as exam-
ples. He used to let the 35-year
old Lewis sit out from plays in
practice to try and save the All-
Pro's legs - Lewis would sit out
one play and then go back in.
And Reed matched Lewis's work
ethic with his preparation off of
the field.
"I was fortunate enough to
be with players that played as
hard as they could," Mattison

he watches as much film as the
coaches do. Then the players
understand, 'Maybe, I'm get-
ting really good because I watch
tape.' A lot of players don't do
that.
"To be able to say I was just at
a place that that's why they were
good, then pretty soon it's, 'Okay,
that's good, maybe I should do
that.'"
The Michigan players have
been receptive to Mattison and
all the defensive coaching staff
so far.
Maybe it's not exactly how
the coach acted around Schem-
bechler, but the coaches did
describe the players as eager to
learn and play well.
"What we have right now, I'm
excited about," Mattison said.
"What I've seen so far, I'm excit-
ed with the way they work and
their attitude - that's all we can
judge it on right now."
But can a unit that broke
Michigan records for the wrong
reasons make dramatic improve-
ments right off the bat?
"It has to - you know, it has
to," Mattision said. "Michigan

Defensive coordinator Greg Mattison is hoping to resurrect a defense that
struggled mightily during Rich Rodriguez's tenure as head coach.
forever has taken great pride damentals, starts with stopping
in defense. And we'll take great the run. It starts with not giving
pride in defense again. That's up big plays and it starts with
our coaching objective in every- playing great red zone defense -
thing we're doing. That starts that's what we'll be working on
with technique, starts with fun- every day."

Despite loss to Illinois, 'M'
is a tournament team

Hunwick gaining confidence in net

You've probably experienced
the feeling before.
Maybe it's like that feeling you
had after fifth grade baseball try-
outs. You botched the last ground
ball right in front of the head
coach and you
figured that KEVIN
would be the RAFTERY
reason you
wouldn't make On Women's
the team - Bosketball
sorry if that
opens up an old wound.
Your stomach churns, you find
it hard to concentrate, you can't
sleep. You know the situation is
out of your hands, yet you can't let
it go. What if you would've done
something different?
If you've ever experienced
these types of feelings, you and
the Michigan women's basketball
team have something in common.
(I bet you never thought you'd
hear that.)
But for the Wolverines, this
feeling comes as they sit square on
the NCAA Tournament bubble,
hoping they've done enough this
season to earn a bid to the Big
Dance - something they haven't
done since 2001.
And this feeling was self-inflict-
ed. It didn't have to be this way.
Just a week and a half ago,
Michigan was in the driver's seat
for an at-large NCAA Tourna-
ment bid. The Wolverines (10-6
Big Ten, 17-12 overall) capped off
their best Big Ten season since the
2000-2001 campaign with a 58-55
win at Illinois, and they secured a
first-round bye and the No. 3 seed
for the Big Ten Tournament.
One win in the Big Ten Tour-
nament and this team was a lock
for the festivities in March.
And after last-place Illinois
upset No. 6 seed Wisconsin and
was slated to play Michigan last
Friday, it appeared the Wolver-
ines' ticket had been punched.

All they had to do was beat the
lowly Fighting Illini - a team
the Wolverines beat twice this
year and who had only recently
snapped a brutal 12-game losing
streak.
Maybe they caught the Illini
when they were hot. Maybe it was
the perfect storm for Michigan
- playing against a team with
absolutely nothingto lose, while
you potentially have everything
to lose.
Whatever it was, it ended in a
55-47 loss for Michigan, in a game
where the Wolverines never really
had a chance. They were down
37-16 at halftime.
That sure doesn't sound likea
Tournament team to me. Neither
does ateam who has lost to the
third-worst team in the Big Ten
(Minnesota) twice and to Detroit
(13-17).
Clearly, the Wolverines' record
won't blow anyone out of the
water. And they know that.
"I know (the tournament com-
mittee) looks at overall records so
much, and obviously ours is 17-12,"
junior guard Courtney Boylan said
after Michigan's loss to Illinois.
"It's not 20 wins. Generally I think
that's what they look for, 19 or 20."
And the team's stats won't
exactly turn any heads either.
Michigan isn't in the nation's top-
50 in scoring offense or defense,
and it lacks a superstar-caliber
player.
But despite all of that, this is a
tournament team.
Not only did these Wolverines
prove they can beat some of the
best teams in the nation - Big
Ten Tournament Champion Ohio
State (twice), Iowa, Kansas, Wis-
consin (twice) - they also have
the perfect formula to weave deep
into the Tournamentbracket.
Michigan had eight different
players lead the team in scoring
this year.

In a three-game stretch start-
ing in late December, when the
Wolverines rolled off three-
straight wins against ranked
opponents, different players led
the team in scoring in each game.
Sophomore forward Rachel
Sheffer led the team with 19
points against then-No. 24 Boston
College, Hicks and junior forward
Carmen Reynolds poured in 17 in
a 64-51 win against then-No. 12
Ohio State, and Boylan tallied 18
in her first start of the year in a
60-53 victory at then-No. 14 Iowa.
On any given night, seven dif-
ferent Wolverines (excluding
sophomore Nya Jordan, who has
been out since late December with
a knee injury) have the potential
to lead this team to victory. Sure,
Hicks is clearly the emotional
leader, and she leads the team in
points per game. But this Michi-
gan team in no way depends on
her to score, like many other
squads do of their senior leaders.
When Michigan is in need of
a bucket, nobody knows who's
going to step up - but everybody
knows that somebody will step
up. That's a rare quality, and it's
one that is crucial in March.
And this team takes care of the
ball - something vital to postsea-
son success. Prior to the Illinois
loss last Friday, the Wolverines
were ranked second in the nation
in turnover-to-assist ratio. Even
after a horrible performance
against the Illini in which Michi-
gan had 15 turnovers and just 12
assists, the Wolverines are still
14th in the nation in that category.
You'll hear that Michigan is on
the bubble. But if I was a betting
man, I'd say that sick feeling that
the Wolverines are feeling now
will turn to elation come Monday
night.
And who knows, maybe you'll
get that baseball career back on
track after all.

By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan coach Red Beren-
son described netminder Shawn
Hunwick's season last year as an
adventure.
In the latter stages of last sea-
son, Hunwick was called upon to
fill the void in net when starter
Bryan Hogan went down with
a groin injury. Having seen less
than three minutes of game-
action prior to that point, Hun-
wick utilized his opportunity
to anchor the Wolverines' push
to reach their 20th-consecutive
NCAA Tournament.
But that was last year, and if
Hunwick knows one thing, it's
that he can't live in the past.
Now, the goalie finds himself
in a similar role. He will be the
one to defend the pipes as Michi-
gan begins its playoff run in this
weekend's CCHA quarterfinal
best-of-three series against Bowl-
ing Green.
"I think last year, it was all
an adventure," Berenson said.
"He was hoping, and he handled
it well. But now he's got a base,
he's got a base of expectations.
He knows what can do (and) he
knows what he should do."
With the regular season com-
pleted, Hunwick has worked
his way to a career-best three
shutouts this season, including
two against Michigan State. The
Sterling Heights, Mich. native
ranks second in the conference in
goals against average (1.95), save
percentage (.931) and winning
percentage (.690) - even after
getting out to a slow start this sea-
son.
Hunwick's record heading into
The Big Chill at the Big House
was a mediocre 3-3-4 and he
wasn't even supposed to play in
the event. But when Hogan went
down during warm-ups, Hunwick
took over. He registered a shutout,
finding the same success as he did
near the end of last season.

SALAM IA/oily
Senior goaltender Shawn Hunwick led Michitan tooa CCHA title last season.

The only difference was that
this time around, Hunwick had
the confidence and the poise of a
veteran.
"I thought he played better in
that situation than he (did when
he) was playing for the job in the
first half," Berenson said. "For
one reason or another, he took
advantage of the opportunity or
he appreciated the opportunity
more. It just seemed tobe another
experience that turned out to be a
positive one for him."
Since that game, Hunwick has
kept his foot on the gas. He led the
Wolverines to both a Great Lakes
Invitational title and a CCHA reg-
ular season title, earning a 16-7-4
overall record and a 5-1-2 line
when making 30 or more saves in
a game along the way.
"If we didn't end up with the
lowest goals against, we weren't
going to win (the CCHA)," Beren-
son said. "He was the reason,
night after night. Look at all the
close games we played in. We
weren't the prolific team that we
could really separate ourselves
many nights from our opponents,
and Hunwick was a big factor in
our success."
As Michigan's postseason
begins this weekend, it marks
the beginning of the end for the
current Wolverine senior class.
But the good news for Michigan

fans is that Hunwick - who was
approached by the coaches after
the 2009-10 season about his addi-
tional year of eligibility - weighed
his options and has decided to stay
at Michigan for another season.
"A lot of people talk about the
goalie as being kind of an indi-
vidual sport," senior forward
Matt Rust said. "There's no one to
back him up, he's the last line of
defense. I know when the offense
hasn't been putting a lot of goals
to the net, we've really looked to
Shawn to backstop us. He's done a
great job all season and he's going
to continue to do that for us in the
future."
Hunwick is sure to put thoughts
about the future on hold as the
only thing occupying his mind is
the job in front of him and the rest
of the Wolverines, starting with
Bowling Green.
And in this year's playoff run,
Hunwick has the experience to
add a little control to his Michigan
adventure.
"I'm definitely confident going
into the playoffs (this year), but
I think at the same time, I'm just
another piece to the puzzle," Hun-
wick said. "I'm asked to do my job,
I'm not asked to recapture last
year's run or do anything like that.
They're asking me just to play
good (in goal), to continue to play
the way I have."

Talor Battle, who has never been

ing Battle are three other senior
starters: Jeff Brooks, David Jack-

four seniors make up a very con-
sistent, veteran squad that has
kept it close or beaten every team
in this conference.
The last chance for these old 4
timers to garner a bid to the
tournament is to win the Big Ten
Tournament and receive an auto
berth. If not, the Nittany Lions
will probably end their season in
the NIT.

The University's five literary magazines compare their inner workings in
a roundtable discussion.
By Andrew Lapin // Daily Arts Writer

eall get the
urge, at least
occasionally -
the desire to
write or draw
something
unusual, out of the ordinary. To create
a work of something that, if you were
to show it to a group of your peers, at
least one person would be kind enough
to dub "art." And when we get the urge,
there is a means through which we can
share that work with the world - several
means, in fact, in the form of the many
literary magazines on campus today.
Six student editors gathered in the
newsroom of The Michigan Daily in
the middle of a Tuesday to talk about
their magazines and the role they play
in fostering creative expression, even in
a world where anyone can use blogs or
WordPress to self-publish their writing.
Fortnight co-editors and LSA seniors
David Kinzer and Sarah Doukakos, sat
on one side of the table, along with two
representatives from Xylem Literary
Magazine: the copy chair, Dena Cohen,
an LSA senior, and assistant submis-
sions manager Cecilia Jaquith, an LSA
sophomore. Opposite them were LSA
senior Jackie Cohen, editor in chief of
the RC Review, and LSA and Engineer-
ing senior Powell Perng, editor in chief
of the upstart publication Blueprint.
With the exception of Xylem and
Fortnight, which are run by the same
organization, most of these editors were
discovering each other's publications for
the first time.
If you wanted to share your story,
poem or artwork with your peers in
the University this year, your piece - a
piece that you had to work up the nerve
to pluck from the cozy insularity of your
own mind to subjectto the critical eyes of
strangers - probably had to go through
someone sitting around this table.
 "I think it's a pretty incredible feat to
have students putting together a maga-
zine," Jaquith said.
"It's a great feeling to pick up a book
and see your name in there," Dena
Cohen added.
And somewhere in that mysterious
gap between your submission e-mail
and the day the publications go to print,
whether or not you will experience that
feelingis decided.
SO MANYMAGAZINES
When gathered into the same room,
each of the editors was surprised at just
how many other literary magazines
were functioning on campus.
Even the University's world-
renowned medical school is home to its
own printed creativity outlet - a publi-
cation named The Hippo, which accepts
submissions both medically and non-
medically themed from its campus com-
munity.
Second-year Medical School students
Priya Rajdev and Owen Albin, co-editors
in chief of The Hippo, who were unable
to participate in the roundtable conver-
sation but said in an interview that they
see value in providing such an outlet to some of the hard-
est-working students on campus.
"We think The Hippo brings a therapeutic outlet to
people who want to exercise their artistic impulses,"
Rajdev and Albin wrote in an e-mail. "If anything, The
Hippo brings a small amount of intellectual balance to
the medical school. For some people, it allows an oppor-
tunity to explore their interest in medicine in a very dif-
ferent way, and for others, it allows the opportunity to
spend time doing something completely different (from
medicine)."
Those ideas of therapy and balance were equally ver-
balized by the editors around the table, who see their pub-
lications as gateways for students to immerse themselves
in the world of literary creativity.
"I think that our literary magazine is really just pro-
moting people to get involved in literary arts," Dena
Cohen said.

This involvement comes through events like readings,
workshops and, in the case of the RC Review, a rummage
sale that made $500 for the magazine its first year.
Most of the workshops are intended to help interested

students prep pieces for possible publication in a maga-

to the chagrin of the editors.
"The last workshop we had, there was one person who
was working on a really fantastic poem," Kinzer recalled.
"And we told her to submit it, and she never did, and my

heart is still a little bit broken."
With the abundance of campus magazines, there's cer-
tainly no shortage of outlets for student creativity. And
more seem to be cropping up all the time.

For instance, this is the inaugural year for Blueprint,
which is set to publish its first issue at the end of the
month. As an Engineering student, Perng took notice of
the many creative writing contests that were offered to
engineers and wanted to establish ar annual outlet for
such works. It was also, he said, partially to buck the com-
mon misconception of the engineering community as a
noncreative environment.
"I don't think that many people think that engineers
are actually interested in literary arts," he said. "It'd be
useful for the rest of the community to see the kind of cre-
ativity, when it comes to literary arts, that Engineering
students share."
When Perng saw how other established programs like
ArtsEngine and the IDEA Institute were already bring-
ing together different North Campus denizens through
a focus on the creative arts, he decided to expand Blue-
print's scope to include the other three colleges on North
Campus: Architecture, Art & Design and Music, Theatre
& Dance.
Jackie Cohen, too, has been able to defy stereotypes
while overseeing the RC Review.

Each week, one Ann Arbor staple menu item becomes a battlefield
as Daily Arts staffers butt heads over which restaurant makes it best.
Vanilla Milkshake

MR. GREEK'S
215 South State
Whatever you do, don't let the weird,
blue plastic, dining hall-like presentation of
Mr. Greek's beverages scare you away: The
creamy, dreamy vanilla-infused milkshake
of this diner heaven is well worth its steep
price. Whether you order the treat as a des-
sert or on the side, your belly will surely
thank you for treating it to such a sumptu-
ous lactose delight - one with just the right
consistency, no less.
PIZZA BOB'S
814 South State
Calling this producta milkshake is mis-
leading, because nothing could be shaken
in what Pizza Bob's calls a "milkshake" -
that's how thick it is. It's essentially soft
serve ice cream in a cup. Of course, this
is not neccessarily a bad thing, especially
since the vanilla taste is rich and creamy.
Diners should just know that eating an
extra-large without a spoon will probably
take about a year and a half.

PIZZA HOUSE
618 Church
The classic vanilla milkshake. Pure,
simple, sweet and satisfying. Pizza House's
iteration of this well loved treat has merit:
It's as thick as peanut butter, creamy as,
well, ice cream, and simply delicious. But
it also has a few demerits: It's pricey and
impossible to sip through a straw. For ulti-
mate enjoyment, the shake is best shared
with a friend and easier to manage after it
has become slightly melted.
POTBELLY'S
300 South State
Don't be fooled by the short, mint-
colored cup and the cookies hugging the
straw - this shake means business. The
taste of vanilla is softened by milk to cre-
ate the classic, true-to-its-name milk-
shake. And, despite the thin straw, you're
not stuck strugglingto suck up the smooth,
velvety goodness because Potbelly's shake
is just thick enough to satisfy without clog-
ging the straw.

Scripting stage and cinema
Student playwrights and screenwriters
discuss their passion for the media
By Veronica Menaldi ( Daily Arts Writer4

IViva la Cuba!

How many hours does the
average student spend sitting on
the couch watching TV shows,
movies or even some form of
onstage production? Chances are
that even for the most devout fol-
lower of media, the time spent
watching a show is not even close
to the amount of time its writ-
ers have put in to create viewers'
obsessions.
Regardless of what type of
script is being produced, stu-
dents playwrights and screen-
writers spend countless hours
brainstorming, organizing and
restructuring their manuscript
to transform it into a beloved
product.
LSA junior Minhdzuy Khora-
mi is constantly revisiting his
drafts. When working on scripts,
Khorami focuses the most on the
dialogue and the general flow of
the piece.
"I like to have that back-and-
forth between people; I crack
myself up with it," he said. "When
I'm talking to people in real life, I
like to script in my head what (I
think) they are going to say."
LSA senior Catherine Mac-
Donald enjoys developing her
characters to the max, gettingthe
nitpicky details mapped out.
"I will go through characters
like a therapist," she said. "I don't
think it's worth writing about
uninteresting people, so I like
writing about really compelling
characters that are a bit quirkier
or have something weird about
them."
The characters are equally
important for Music, Theatre
& Dance freshman Tyler Dean.
When in the process of creating
a new script, he covers his room
with Post-it notes with ideas
about the journey his character
will go through from beginning
to end.
Though the generation of ideas,
dialogue and characters is similar
when writing for the stage and for
the screen, each has its own perks
and qualities that dictate what a
writer can make happen in his or
her proudest productions.
Penning for the stage
One of the treats theater writ-
ers benefit from is the immediate
* gratification of seeing their work
performed in its raw and real
form.
Khorami has been interested
in scriptwriting since before he
started college. He has aspirations
to write for television but fell in
love with the art form of theater.
"It's something I can actu-
ally see right away," he said. "I

can get immediate feedback by
having it performed, so I started
working in that medium with the
stage and with actors instead of
onscreen since the stage is avail-
able to me."
Playwriting also allows lib-
erty in the writer's descriptions.
In the realm of television and
film, Khorami said, a lot more
attention needs to be given to the
visual aspects and what needs to
be shown.
Dean has always been inter-
ested in storytelling. Theatrical
scriptwriting also allows him to
exercise his interest in acting -
primarily musical theater.
"Music plays such a strong part
in telling a story," he said. "It's a
beautiful way to convey messages
that regular plays aren't able to do.
It also brings together different
sorts of art mediums."
Dean has worked on two full
productions as well as a short
one-act play.
His productions tend to be
full of intriguing characters and
out-of-the-box concepts. His first
musical was a parody on "Twi-
light" and the one he is currently
working on is about zombies.
But once the characters have
been established, the hardest
part of developing a script can go
beyond the actual idea generation:
What if you thought of something
that just can't seem to fit in?
"Editing is very frustrating,"
he said. "They say in writing you
have to kill your own babies. It's
really hard to do because you get
attached to every single aspect of
the show, so removing one tiny
joke or line seems like it can dam-
age the entire thing."
If there were to be a downside
to the scriptwriting process, it's
that it can be a rather daunting
and lonely task. But when the
script is actually finished, there's
a certain amount of collabora-
tion with the director and actors
- and this is when the script can
really grow and come to life.
"Once I've written it, it's kind
of out of my hands," MacDonald
said. "I like to see what happens to
it afterwards. You kind of have to
take the backseat once you're done
writing it,"
Though the skill of playwriting
is something that has to be devel-
oped, it can lead to many fruitful
experiences.
"If you enjoy writing, playwrit-
ing is a really powerful way to tell
a story as a performance piece,"
MacDonald said. "It's something
that's difficult, but if you get it,
you get it. It's really fun, and the
end result is really rewarding and
powerful."

LSA senior Greg Wachtenheim is working on a sci-fi film insipred by dolphins.

Writing for the boob tube
and the silver screen
Playwriting, of course, isn't
for everyone. Maybe the stage,
costumes and live audience don't
draw potential writers in, but
the possibility of having special
effects and creating something
easily distributable is more up
their alley.
LSA senior Jim Graessle, a stu-
dent TV scriptwriter who aspires
to enter the TV writing world
professionally, has always migrat-
ed toward screenwriting due to
his interest in having full control
of a story and being able to create
an entire world.
"Everyone wants to be a
director, but a director really
takes someone else's stories and
mutates them," he said. "The
writer creates everything; it's the
writer's job to create."
TV writing is a continuous job
that influences the storyline of
the show. Another aspect that
pushed Graessle 'into the field
is the possibility to work with a
group of writers, whereas film
scriptwriters tends to work on
their own.
Aspiring scriptwriter and LSA
junior Matt Kane, on the other
hand, is drawn to the particular
perks and annoyances of movie
scriptwriting.
For him, the most frustrating
part of scriptwriting is know-
ing that his works likely won't be
made into a full-on reality. But
that doesn't stop him from trying
to bring laughterto those exposed
to his works.
"I mostly write comedy," he
said. "Stuff that I can show to
anybody so they can chuckle or
get any sort of emotional response
- that way I know I'm at least on
the right track."
LSA junior Caitlin Northcutt
prefers writing for film over tele-
vision because it allows her to
recount something from begin-
ning to end.

"You get to tell the full story,"
she said. "You don't have to break
it up and hope you get another
season to tell your story. You also
get a bigger budget on movies, so
you can do a little bit more than
you could on television."
Her experience with script-
writing has also given her a new
perspective as she watches TV
shows and movies. She said she
now sees more than just the story,
but what went in to making it look
the way it does.
LSA senior Greg Wachtenheim
has worked on both films and
television scripts and is current-
ly writing a science fiction film
inspired by dolphins and a televi-
sion series focusing on the rela-
tions of random people in a co-op.
In order to make his scripts
as real as possible, he has done
outside research to back his con-
cepts. For instance, Wachtenheim
visited his friend's co-op and
spoke with some of the residents
to get a feel for the dynamics in a
typical house.
According to Wachtenheim,
one of the most frustrating parts
of scriptwriting is knowing when
some joke or scene that the writer
loves has to be removed. The goal
for having a successful film is to
make sure the script is as good as
it can be.
"If you don't shoot something
the right way, the humor might
be lost," Wachtenheim said. "You
want your script to be as good
as possible because the trend is
that it's only going to go downhill
from there. Since the best stories
are written, it's hard to align your
visions properly."
Despite all the differences
between theater and screen, most
scriptwriters are content work-
ing for either medium. Aspir-
ing student scriptwriters might
find the career field competitive,
but with patience, the right con-
nections and baby steps into the
profession, they could end up
making it big.

Whitewashed from
the inside out, Frita
Batidos onW. Wash-
ington St. must have been some
Tom Sawyer of a job tocomplete.
The new-
est venture-
from former
"Top Chef"
contestant
Eve Aronoff,
this self-
proclaimed
"snack bar"
has been LILA
stirringup KALICK
buzz since
openinglast
December.
In January, Aronoff
announced that her other restau-
rant, French-influenced Eve in
Kerrytown, would be closing. But
ever-resilient, she decided to go
against the old "Top Chef" adage,
it's time to "pack up your knives
and go."
Instead, she has blessed us
with her newest project - a
Cuban-inspired eatery that even
in its infancy seems to have
enough steam to carry itself past
the ephemeral stage of restau-
rant-hood. Frita Batidos's relaxed
atmosphere and host of unique
flavors provide the perfect com-
bination to suit the cosmopolitan
tastes of its Ann Arbor clientele.
Inside, customers order at
the bar, then take a seat at the
communal-style picnic tables
where waiters bring meals on
individual trays. People seemed
to be complaining about the seat-
ing style, which to be honest, was
a bit uncomfortable, but not a
dealbreaker.
The choice of white walls,
fluorescent lighting and stain-
less steel serving platters might
have proven oppressive, buta
series of tropical touches, like a
large painted flower, fresh limes
cradled in net hammocks hang-
ing at the edges of the tables and
a floor-to-ceiling window lin-
ing the entrance save the space
from feeling too sterile. In fact,
the whiteness is surprisingly
enjoyable. It contrasts pleasantly
with the colorful food before
you, allowing the meal to take its
rightful place as the main event.
In terms of cuisine, Aronoff
cooks up her take on some
Cuban classics. The eatery's
featured dish, the frita, is akin
to a burger - but beyond. A tra-
ditional Cuban frita consists of
ground chorizo grilled in patty
form, served on an egg bun with
shoestring French fries on top.
Frita Batidos's interpretation of
the sandwich is available in the
conventional chorizo form but
also in turkey, fish and vegetarian
black bean versions.
Aronoff's frita comes with a
lovable portion of shoestrings
on a brioche bun. Mayonnaise

spreads in sweet chili, lemon-
scented and chipotle varieties
accompany and can be ordered
on the side. If you're bold, you
can order it "loco" - adding lime
salsa, a fried egg, coleslaw and
Muenster cheese to the mix. It is
fantastic.
Fried plantains are the perfect
addition, tossed with cilantro
garlic butter. A pitfall of plan-
tains is that they're often too oily.
These aren't - they're surpris-
ingly light, almost tangy. One
order will cost you $6, but they're
bigenough for three to share.
Frita Batidos also prepares
some other notable sandwiches,
like the "Inspired Cuban," which
features lemongrass-roasted
pork, thick-cut bacon, ham,
Gruyere cheese, cornichons and
their chipotle mayo on Cuban
bread. The open-faced grilled
cheese, an equally exciting
option, is made with Muenster,
tomato and red onion on brioche.
Batidos, the other half of the
joint's name (so they mustbe
important), are shakes made with
fresh fruit and cream milk sweet-
ened with honey. They come in
avariety of flavors, like mocha,
sour orange and cajeta - goat's
milk caramel, which is also used
to make some of the restaurant's
coffee drinks. The coconut cream
batido is not to be believed.
Each comes with its own mini-
umbrella. Who doesn't love a
mini-umbrella? Impractical but
appreciated - feels like being at
the beach.
Eve Aronoff's
newest venture.
Also impractical, and a little
misguided, is the way Frida Bati-
dos serves its juices. Ginger-lime
juice comes in a plastic bag with
a straw. But the juice inside is
great - spicy and sweet, simulta-
neously. It will leave you wanting
more of it and less of its absurd
packaging.
A diverse breakfast menu
contends with the regular fare. I
choose the veggie Cuban omelet
- stuffed with black beans, Pica-
dillo and Muenster cheeses. The
dish was served atop a banana
leaf with spicy potatoes, guaca-
mole and rum-soaked pineapple.
It was, in aword, heavenly. Also
worth complimenting is the
coffee. The drinks available are
unique and flavorful, a good
break from the regular routine.
All in all, breakfast was the per-
fect speed, snazzy without trying
too hard.
Despite minor kinks in pre-
sentation, like faulty juice pack-
ing and picnic table seating that

Doukakos and Dena Cohen are

a writer. But at the other end of
the spectrum is Jaquith, an aspir-
ing high school French teacher -
though she said she would jump at
the chance to oversee the produc-

tion of a similar literary publica-
tion at whatever school she ends
up working at.
Despite their different voca-
tional interests, all of the editors
were quick to list ways in which
their roles have aided them in
their future career goals -regard-
less of what those goals might
be. As Medical School students,
Rajdev and Albin most likely won't
be pursuing careers in literature
to pay off student loans. But they
noted that their roles at The Hippo
have still taught them valuable
skills about the world they're pre-
paring to enter into.
"Working in a group and sort-
ing out differing opinions is cru-
cial to working as an effective part
of a health care team," they wrote.
Regardless of what each indi-
vidual's futures hold, all of the
editors are steadfast in their opti-
mism about the future of campus
literary magazines.
"I think that magazines will
always have a future on campus,"
Perng said. "Until the day when
everyone uses Kindles."
But even when that happens,
the urge to create - and, for edi-
tors like these, to present - will
still be very much alive. And if you
have the drive and something to
show for it, there will always be a
place to accept your submissions.

From Page 3B
perhaps isn't everyone's bag,
this place really hit the mark.
It's exactly the kind of res-
taurant Ann Arbor needs and
wants - cutting-edge cuisine
that's not too precious or pre-
tentious. It's a dining experi-

ence that's thrill-packed and
frill free, where the food is
pedestrian with no less pedi-
gree. Cheers to Aronoff for
stepping outside the box and
cooking up something we can
really sink our teeth into.
Kalick is still at Frida Banditos,
eating. To invite yourself along,
