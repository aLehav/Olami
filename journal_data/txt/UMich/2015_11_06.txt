Black Lives Matter protesters gather in front of Ann Arbor City Hall on Thursday evening to honor the one year anniversary of the death of Ann Arbor resident 
Aura Rosser. Demonstrators held signs calling for the firing of Ann Arbor Police Officer David Ried, who fatally shot Rosser last November.

After police fatally 
shot A2 woman, 
activists continue 
calls for justice

Nearly one year after an 

Ann Arbor police officer fatally 
shot Ann Arbor resident Aura 
Rosser 
while 
responding 
to 

domestic violence call, members 
of Ann Arbor to Ferguson — a 
local activist group associated 
with the Black Lives Matter 
movement — protested outside 
City Hall on Thursday night as 
part of a continuing effort to 
condemn and raise awareness of 
police brutality.

The organization was formed 

one year ago in direct protest 
to the nature of Rosser’s death. 
On Nov. 9, 2014, Officer David 
Ried shot and killed Rosser. On 
Jan. 30, 2015, the Washtenaw 

County 
prosecutor’s 
report 

deemed Ried’s actions reflective 
of “lawful self-defense.” No 
charges were brought against 
him.

According 
to 
the 
report, 

police officers arrived on the 
scene following a call from 
Victor Stephens, with whom 
Rosser was living at the time. 
The officers saw her attacking 
Stephens with a knife in her 
hand; when she saw the officers, 
she began to approach them. 
Ried fatally shot Rosser after 

ordering her to put down the 
knife, while fellow Officer Mark 
Raab simultaneously shot Rosser 
with a Taser.

Thursday’s 
protest, 
which 

included 
about 
30 
people, 

strategically took place during an 
event at City Hall for community 
members to meet candidates 
for the Ann Arbor Police Chief 
position.

Forum explores 
efforts to create a 
campus culture of 

sustainability

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

The 
University’s 
annual 

Sustainability 
Town 
Hall 

focused this year on three main 
goals: reducing waste, cutting 
greenhouse gas emissions and 
creating a culture of sustainability 
on campus.

About 40 people gathered 

Thursday 
morning 
at 
the 

Hatcher Graduate Library to 
hear University President Mark 
Schlissel and other University 
officials 
discuss 
campus 

sustainability efforts.

“What we’re doing together 

isn’t new,” Schlissel said. “What 
we’re doing is continuing the 
efforts made by many of you 
to push hard as a university to 
live up to our responsibility to 
environmental stewardship and 
our responsibility to subsequent 
generations.”

During a leadership breakfast 

in October, Schlissel outlined 
several 
efforts 
to 
improve 

sustainability through a new 
recycling and compost plan, a 
waste management study within 
the University’s health system, 
a new natural gas fuel turbine 
project and piloting a zero-waste 
game day during the 2016 football 
season.

Last year, Schlissel called 

for a review of the University’s 
sustainability 
goals, 
first 

launched 
under 
former 

University President Mary Sue 
Coleman in 2011. The goals were 
not originally scheduled up for 
review for another year, but 
Schlissel moved up the process 
after 
receiving 
letters 
from 

faculty and students.

The University’s most recent 

annual 
sustainability 
report 

found that carbon gas emissions 
decreased in 2012, but increased 
in 2013. Waste production has 
increased since the adoption of 
the 2011 sustainability goals, but 
emissions from transportation 
have decreased.

Research has 

potential to combat 

onset of cardiac 

arrhythmias

By MAYA SHANKAR

Daily Staff Reporter

A new nanoparticle developed 

at the University may prove key to 
treating a condition that affects 
nearly 4 million Americans a year.

As part of a five-year ongoing 

study, a University research team 
announced late last month they 
had created a nanoparticle that 
could be essential to a targeted 
therapy for cardiac arrhythmias. 
Cardiac arrhythmias are caused 
by malfunctions in certain heart 
muscle cells that lead to erratic 
heart beats and may eventually 
cause heart attacks or strokes. 
The new technique developed 
uses nanotechnology to more 
precisely target and destroy the 

cells within the heart that cause 
cardiac arrhythmias.

The findings of the study are 

detailed in a new paper in the 
journal 
Science 
Translational 

Medicine.

Currently, cardiac arrhythmias 

are usually treated with drugs 
or with radiofrequency cardiac 
ablation, a procedure that burns 
away malfunctioning cells using a 
laser. Both drugs and ablation are 
effective treatments, but they can 
result in unintended damage to 
surrounding cells.

“It’s 
almost 
like 
you 
are 

bombing the heart with the laser,” 
said Jerome Kalifa, an assistant 
professor at the Medical School 
and one of the lead researchers 
in the study. “Right now, we can 
only target the general area, so 
there is collateral damage.”

The 
new 
nanoparticle 

treatment 
was 
successful 
in 

studies conducted on rodents and 
sheep. Researchers found they 
were able destroy malfunctioning

Nearly 200 people filled 

the Ann Arbor City Council 
chambers Thursday evening 

as the body heard community 
input on the controversial city 
deer cull slated for January. 
After public comments, most of 
which railed against the plans, 
the council voted in two 10-1 
votes to move forward with 
plans for the cull.

The council also approved a 

resolution to further investigate 
nuisance complaints at an off-

Carrying out the cull was 

contingent on council passing 

two additional resolutions. The

At the end of the darkest, 

narrowest alley in England, there 
exists a door. Only half the height 
of a full-grown adult and black as 
tar, this door sits patiently on the

awaiting its next victim. This 
door should never be opened. 
But just as the big red button

Forum aims to 
draw attention to 
gerrymandering, 
call for reform

BY RIYAH BASHA

Daily Staff Reporter

Increasing political polariza-

tion and strategic redistricting 
were the central topics of dis-
cussion Thursday night as the 
League of Women Voters of the 
Ann Arbor Area hosted their 
second discussion in the last two 
weeks on the issue. The event 
attracting roughly 30 attendees 
to the Ford School of Public Pol-
icy.

The forum, co-sponsored by 

the University’s Center for Local, 
State, and Urban Policy, is part 
of an educational campaign the 
League of Women Voters is host-
ing across the state to increase 
voter awareness about the way 
electoral districts are drawn in 
Michigan.

Susan Smith, vice president of 

program planning for the organi-
zation’s Michigan chapter, gave 
a short summary of the history 
of state redistricting, its pitfalls 
today and a possible plan of action 

for voters. Smith said the current 
system, in which the state legisla-
ture has the authority to draw up 
its own district maps and vote on 
them, presents a conflict of inter-
est for politicians.

“Politicians are drawing their 

own voting maps to manipulate 
elections and keep their party in 
power,” she said. “A vast majority 
of districts, because of this, aren’t 
competitive … it’s putting the fox 
in charge of the henhouse.”

Michigan’s electoral districts 

were originally drawn as equal 
squares under the principles of 
being “compact and contiguous.” 
The state legislature’s maneuver-
ing over the years, however, has 
resulted in districts of varying 
shapes and sizes, as lawmakers 
may adjust borders to include or 
exclude certain types of voters. 
Smith pointed to the state’s 14th 
congressional 
district, 
which 

stretches from Detroit to Farm-
ington Hills, encompassing a 
large block of Democratic party 
members.

“(The district) isn’t exactly the 

shape of a salamander,” Smith 
said. “But it’s also definitely not 
compact. This is great if you’re a 
Democrat, but it also means that 
there are fewer Democrats in 
other districts.”

A decision last summer by 

the Supreme Court that upheld 
independent redistricting com-
missions motivated the Michigan 
chapter to initiate redistricting 
sessions across the state. Smith 
said multiple voters expressed 
interest to the organization about 
initiating reform in Michigan.

States have the option to per-

mit state lawmakers to mark 
their own lines or authorize inde-
pendent citizen groups to draw 
maps without needing approval 
from the state legislature. Six 
states currently employ indepen-
dent commissions, and just this 
week, the League’s Ohio chapter 
helped pass a bill for statewide 
redistricting reform. Multiple 
audience members voiced sup-
port for Michigan to implement 
such a change in its redistricting 
system.

Joe Schwarz, a former Repub-

lican member of the Michigan 
Senate and U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives, was one of those 
in attendance to advocate for 
reform based on personal law-
making experience.

“(The League) is on the right 

track,” Schwarz said. “We’re ger-
rymandered … and it’s totally 
discombobulated our legisla-
ture.”

outlined the University’s plan 
to reduce carbon emissions. He 
said the University aims to cut 
emissions by 25 percent by 2025.

One of the biggest contributors 

to that goal will be the new 
turbine, which uses natural gas to 
produce electricity. Once in place, 
Robben said, the turbine will 
increase Central Campus’ power 
plant efficiency significantly. The 
plant is currently fueled by both 
gas and oil.

“The central power plant is 

a combined cycle, cogeneration 
facility,” Robben said. “It is using 
two technologies coupled together 
to produce a very efficient design. 
We were then able to use that to 
create a facility that is operating at 
80-percent efficiency.”

John Lawter, associate director 

for building services and grounds, 
discussed the University’s waste 
reduction goals — a 40-percent 
reduction in waste sent to landfills 

by 2025.

He said while 40 percent is a 

bold target, he hoped it would 
motivate the campus community.

“We had an opportunity to 

change it, but we decided not to 
because we felt there is nothing 
like an aggressive goal to inspire 
and challenge the University 
to 
make 
these 
fundamental 

changes.”

Lawter said one of the first 

initiatives 
the 
University 
is 

working 
on 
is 
standardizing 

recycling 
and 
waste 
signage 

across campus.

“We have all these different 

containers out there, different 
signage, different locations and it 
can be very confusing,” he said. 
“We want to try to make this 
simpler and make it better.”

Drew 
Horning, 
deputy 

director and chief of staff of 
the 
Graham 
Sustainability 

Institute, also discussed the 
University’s efforts to create a 
“culture of sustainability” on 
campus.

He said awareness and concern 

for sustainability varies widely, 
the goal is to find a way to reach 
people across the spectrum.

“It quickly became aware that 

people are at very different places 
on this campus in regards to their 
levels of awareness, dispositions 
and behaviors, and we need to 
recognize that,” Horning said. 
“We cannot assume that everyone 
is going to be gung-ho at the 
forefront trying to be a leader on 
this issue.”

Horning said the University 

plans to employ major statement 
events, 
like 
the 
zero-waste 

football game planned for the 
2016 season, to draw attention to 
sustainability.

“These are things that are 

highly visible symbols that people 
on campus and people who come 
to campus from the outside will 
see and will demonstrate a visible 
commitment to sustainability,” 
he said. “Zero-waste athletics is 
one example how we show people 
who don’t necessarily work for 
or attend the University that this 
is something that is important to 

us.”

Terry 
Alexander, 
executive 

director 
of 
the 
Department 

of 
Occupational 
Safety 
and 

Environmental Health and the 
Office of Campus Sustainability, 
concluded 
the 
events 
by 

addressing the need to change 
people’s thinking.

“The common thread through 

all of this is how do we get people 
to adjust?” Alexander said. “We 
can put all of these recycling bins 
in place but if we can’t get people 
to do it, we’re never going to make 
it.”

LSA junior Jacob Grochowski, 

who attended the event, said he 
thought the ideas presented in 
the talks were important, but 
needed additional explanation.

“I think they are really 

exciting, 
but 
I 
hope 
they 

continue to iterate on them,” 
Grochowksi said. “They are an 
important first step and I’m glad 
the University is taking action to 
put these in motion, but I hope 
that they will keep building on 
them.”

cells 
more 
precisely 
using 

nanoparticles activated by low-
level red light illumination, as 
opposed to the traditional high-
powered laser.

The treatment is a modified 

version of a technique currently 
used in cancer treatment, where 
doctors mark target cells with 
a chemical that makes them 
sensitive to low-level red light, 
according to Uma Mahesh Avula, 
a postdoctoral research fellow 
and member of the research 
team. The light destroys only 
the marked cells, leaving the 
surrounding cells and tissue 
unharmed.

“With this study, we developed 

a specific nanoparticle that targets 
a very specific cell type: cardiac 
myocytes,” Avula said.

Cardiac myocytes are a type 

of heart muscle cell that have 

been linked to the development of 
cardiac arrhythmias. Kalifa said 
the specificity of the nanoparticle 
in targeting these cells allows 
for more flexibility in treatment, 
decreased 
complications, 
and 

increased protection of structures 
within and around the heart.

“The goal of this project was to 

adapt the tools that are working 
well for cancer cells so that they 
can recognize cardiac cells that 
initiate and habituate cardiac 
arrhythmias,” he said.

The team initially tried using 

nanoparticles the same size as 
those used for cancer treatment, 
which are about 120 nanometers 
in size. That approach, Avula said, 
was unsuccessful, leading to the 
team’s main challenge — figuring 
out what size of nanoparticle to 
develop. Ultimately, they settled 
on a smaller size, developing 
a particle that was only six 
nanometers in size.

Chemistry 
Prof. 
Raoul 

Kopelman, who led the team, 
said the size they ended up with 

was small even by nanotechnology 
standards.

“The weight of one human hair 

is 80 microns,” he said. “These 
particles are over 10,000 times 
smaller than that.”

Within 
the 
tiny 
particle, 

an amino acid that causes the 
particular to target myocytes, as 
well as a chemical that makes the 
particle light sensitive and another 
chemical to shield it from the 
immune system. During the study, 
the nanoparticles were injected 
into the heart and absorbed by the 
target cell. Low-level red light was 
then used to destroy only the cells 
with the nanoparticles in them.

“This technology allows us to 

simplify the procedure for treating 
cardiac arrhythmias, make it more 
efficient, and safer,” Kalifa said.

The next step for the research 

team will be to replicate their 
successful results on rodents and 

sheep in a trial with humans. 
The 
researchers 
are 
also 

working to develop a method for 
producing larger amounts of the 
nanoparticles at pharmaceutical 
grade standards.

“This is one of the first times that 

a targeted therapy for arrhythmias 
has been developed,” Kalifa said. 
“It will be a while still, but should 
we have the right resources, we 
could contribute significantly to 
improving treatment for patients 
with arrhythmias.”

Kopelman, who has the very 

disease he is targeting, said the 
cross-disciplinary 
research 

between material chemistry and 
cardiology represented an exciting 
step forward in the field and for 
him personally.

“I have been suffering from 

heart arrhythmias since age 11, so 
it has always been my ambition to 
do something about it,” he said.

University Police 
 and eventually 

taken away in an ambulance after 
reportedly assaulting at least three 
people on the Diag on 
Wednesday 

night around 8 p.m

week to transfer $2 million to the 
Attorney General’s office to cover 
litigation costs from defending 
Michigan’s ban on same-sex mar-
riage.

The move drew some contro-

versy from Democrats on the com-
mittee, namely state Rep. Adam 
Zemke (D–Ann Arbor), who filed 
a motion to block the transfer 
Wednesday. Zemke’s motion was 
defeated along party lines. 

“I’m disappointed members of 

the Appropriations Committee 
gave their tacit support today for 
this waste of taxpayer money,” 
Zemke said in a statement. “There 
are dozens of more significant 
and necessary areas to which this 
money could be applied. We owe it 
to our constituents to use a fund-
ing allotment of this magnitude 
appropriately.”

The funding will come from the 

Office of Urban Initiatives, which 
the transfer document notes had 
available funds due to a vacancy 
and other non-specified savings. 
Andrea Bitely, Michigan Attorney 
General Bill Schuette’s commu-
nications director, declined com-
ment Thursday afternoon.

sole dissenting vote on both 
resolutions.

In August, City Council 

voted to establish a deer 
management 
program 

designed to reduce the Ann 
Arbor deer population — 
both to decrease nuisance 
caused by a well-stocked deer 
population and to support 
biological diversity. The city 
plans to hire sharpshooters to 
kill 100 deer with firearms to 
control the population within 
the city limits.

At 
Thursday’s 
council 

meeting, about 50 Ann Arbor 
residents spoke in opposition 
to 
the 
deer 
cull. 
Many 

Ann Arbor residents said 
they were shocked to hear 
the city would implement 
such a program and raised 
concerns about the safety of 
local residents and the moral 
considerations behind a cull.

“I was always in awe of 

this cultural and intellectual 
mecca,” Ann Arbor resident 
Kim Johnson told the council. 
“Imagine 
my 
shock 
and 

disbelief that this community 
is planning to kill deer right 
in the middle of its city. What 
happened to seeking creative, 
non-violent solutions? Where 
are the best and brightest 
now?”

Others 
were 
concerned 

about 
research 
showing 

that 
deer 
culling 
proved 

ineffective 
in 
neighboring 

towns, such as Jackson. Many 
urged the council to wait 
on implementing the deer 
cull until further research is 
conducted, as the issue isn’t 
an emergency.

“Culling 
in 
urban 

environments offers precious 
little in the terms of a 
short-term solution, and is 
in 
the 
meantime 
tearing 

our 
community 
apart,” 

Ann Arbor resident Karen 
Anderson said.

However, 
not 
all 

were 
opposed 
to 
the 

implementation of culling. A 
few long-time residents said 
they have noticed a growth 
in deer population compared 
to 
previous 
decades 
and 

supported efforts to curb the 
population.

“I am in favor of the 

shooting of deer within city 
limits, even expanding the 
limits,” Ann Arbor resident 
Gordon Roberts said. “If you 
go below the breakeven point, 
you are wasting time and 
effort. I support anything we 
can do to get rid of as many 
deer as possible.”

Another 
issue 
debated 

Thursday: investigation of 
noise complaints directed 
at the University’s chapter 
of the Alpha Sigma Phi 
fraternity at 920 Baldwin 
Ave. 
Councilmember 

Stephen 
Kunselman 

(D–Ward 
3) 
proposed 

a 
resolution 
Thursday 

asking the city attorney 
to investigate the house 
and 
determine 
possible 

methods for handling any 
nuisance. The resolution was 
ultimately passed.

Some 
local 
residents 

said Thursday they were 
concerned about the loud 
nature of the fraternity in 
what is primarily a residential 
neighborhood.

“When you move into a 

residential 
neighborhood, 

you enter into a community 
contract, but the fraternity 
brothers seem to ignore 
that,” said Merton Shill, 
Ann Arbor resident and 
Alpha Sigma Phi neighbor. 
“We had to call the police 
five times in the past three 
weeks just to get some sleep 
at night. Why is it that these 
people find it so hard to 
follow the law?”

Fraternity president Tom 

Allen, a Public Policy junior, 
defended the fraternity at 
council. Allen called on the 
council to halt the city’s 
investigation 
into 
their 

house, claiming it would set 
an unfeasible precedence for 
the future, and place a large 
burden on city employees.

“We make different kinds 

of 
headlines 
than 
other 

fraternities do; we make a 
difference on campus,” Allen 
said. “I hope this shows that 
we are just good students, 
trying to coexist with the 
neighbors next door.”

central mission is to encourage 
City Council to revoke Ried’s 
contract with the AAPD, pay 
restitution to Rosser’s family 
and ultimately promote systemic 
changes within the city’s law 
enforcement system to combat 
racially charged police brutality.

“We want laws to hold police 

accountable for the things they 
do in the community,” Ahmad-
Robinson said. “What happened 
here and what happens around 

the country a lot of the time is 
police use excessive force, and 
then when it’s time to hold them 
accountable, someway, somehow 
they are able to justify their force.”

The group additionally asks 

for City Council to establish an 
independent 
Citizens 
Review 

Board dedicated to addressing 
issues of police misconduct, as 
well as to promote officer-training 
reform.

Ahmad-Robinson, 
who 
has 

experience organizing similar 
events in Baltimore, said he was 
impressed with the turnout at 
City Hall. He added that the 

city of Ann Arbor’s Human 
Rights Commission — which 
met Thursday to discuss the 
plans — has been working to 
initiate a policy that promotes 
accountability within the law 
enforcement system by allowing 
citizens to file complaints about 
officers.

“That’s getting going, but what 

we want to see is that those laws 
actually do something because a lot 
of the times laws are written and 
things are done, but nothing really 
changes,” Ahmad-Robinson said.

Rackham student Scott Fox 

attended the protest and said he 

was motivated to join Ann Arbor 
to Ferguson because he believes 
police should not be permitted 
to fire at citizens without loaded 
firearms.

“Policemen shouldn’t be killing 

unarmed people. It’s simple,” Fox 
said.

Following the protest outside, 

members 
of 
Ann 
Arbor 
to 

Ferguson filed into the Ann 
Arbor City Council chambers and 
held signs advocating justice for 
Rosser throughout the meeting. 
Several 
public 
commenters 

also demanded an end to police 
brutality within the city.

Still no justice

AUSTIN MCCOY | VIEWPOINT

I 
 

was expecting the cat-calls. 
The double-takes. The stares. 
I was expecting the aggres-

sion. The con-
versations. 
I 

was dressed in 
a bikini top on 
Halloween. 
A 

bikini top made 
to look like a 
pair of boobs. 
And let me tell 
you, 
on 
first 

glance, it really 
looked convinc-
ing. I wore a 
sign around my 
neck saying in bold letters, “Free 
the Nipple.” I didn’t include the 
hashtag symbol, the main way this 
2014 
film-turned-equality-move-

ment is usually publicized these 
days, but it was all the same.

I was both excited and terrified 

to go out into the world. I would 
not be blending in that weekend. 
When I told my housemate Mack-
enzie about my costume, she was 
just as excited as I was. She took it 
an ingenious step further, creating 
a costume of a boob (composed of 
nude clothing and a paper-mâchéd 
nipple), bound by various shackles, 
with her own “Free the Nip” sign. 
 

We were glad to have each other 
for what we viewed as a fun way 
to spread awareness, as well as our 
own little social experiment.

To complete our costumes, we 

both had second signs, mine on 
my back, reading “Still Not Asking 
For It,” in hopes of also spreading 
the message that no matter what a 
woman is wearing, she is still not 
“asking for it” (“it” being any form 
of sexual contact or aggression), 
unless she is literally asking for 
it. Leaving all shame at the door, 
we walked with some friends to 

Necto. It was Pride Friday, which 
made us feel at least a little safer; 
there wouldn’t be as many creepy 
guys, right? Maybe I was naïve. 
There were some things I knew to 
expect but others I was entirely 
 

unprepared for.

When I arrived at Necto, I was 

amazed at how quickly the compli-
ments rained down. People from 
all ranges of the sexuality and/or 
drunkenness spectrum told me they 
loved the costume. However, some 
of the compliments quickly turned 
to touching or groping, one man 
even partially pulling my top off. 
Apparently they didn’t understand 
the whole “Still Not Asking For It” 
thing. Yet, had I known at that point 
what the next night would bring, I 
wouldn’t have thought that Necto 
was so bad.

Saturday night, Mackenzie and 

I went to Rick’s American “Café” 
(hey, we wanted a large subject pop-
ulation for our social experiment). 
With vastly more heterosexual men 
in the room, compliments changed 
from “I love your costume!” to “I 
agree for a totally different rea-
son!” followed by their awkward 
laughter. I lost count of the times 
that guys said some version of 
“Well if you want to free the nipple, 
then show me your real ones!” in 
tones ranging from light-hearted 
to indignant and demanding. (To 
which I responded, “No dude, that’s 
not the point,” or in one instance, 
Mackenzie and I responded by 
simply singing the then-playing 
song “I Don’t Fuck With You” over 
 

his protests.)

I was not expecting the level of 

direct physical and verbal aggres-
sion. Maybe I’m naïve. Or maybe 
some people really need to figure out 
basic human respect. But the thing 
that threw me off the most that 

night wasn’t this overt aggression. 
It was a question I never expected to 
hear: “What does that even mean?”

Sometimes, especially around the 

people I surround myself with, it’s 
easy to forget that some people still 
don’t understand that being a femi-
nist isn’t something to be ashamed 
of. I figured that everyone kept up on 
this stuff — I mean, Miley Cyrus and 
Matt McGorry talk about it, right? 
But here I was at Rick’s, explaining 
to people what “Free the Nipple” 
even meant.

Here’s what it means: Women’s 

bodies, 
especially 
their 
breasts 

and nipples, are constantly sexual-
ized in our society. When we see a 
man’s nipples, it’s seen as normal or 
OK. But as soon as we see women’s 
nipples, it’s immediately perceived 
as sexual. Even mothers trying to 
breastfeed in public must go to great 
lengths to ensure they are properly 
covered. The sexualization of wom-
en’s bodies is so deeply rooted in our 
society that most of us don’t even 
think about it.

“Of course women shouldn’t 

show their nipples,” people (like my 
parents) say. But why should men’s 
nipples be OK and not women’s? The 
fact that they are so taboo just goes 
to show that they are not viewed as 
just another body part, but some-
thing sexual. That women’s bodies 
aren’t just bodies, they are some-
thing sexual. I mean, I agree that 
women are freakin’ beautiful cre-
ations. But we’re also so, so much 
more. Free the Nipple isn’t about 
walking around naked. It’s about 
nudity not meaning “asking for it.” 
It’s about wanting to be seen as peo-
ple, instead of sexual objects. And 
that’s it

Almost one year ago, Ann Arbor 

police shot and killed 40-year-old 
Aura Rosser in her home. In the final 
hour of the night on Nov. 9, 2014, 
Ann Arbor police officers Mark 
Raab and David Ried responded to 
a call for assistance from Rosser’s 
partner, 54-year-old Victor Ste-
phens, who claimed she attacked 
him with a knife. Within five to 10 
seconds of entering their home, 
Raab discharged his taser and Ried 
discharged his firearm, striking and 
killing Rosser. They claimed she 
charged them with a kitchen knife.

The Ann Arbor to Ferguson 

movement was born in the city’s 
streets on Nov. 25, 2014, the night 
after St. Louis County Prosecutor 
Robert 
McCulloch 
announced 

Ferguson, Mo., police officer Darren 
Wilson would not face charges for 
shooting and killing 18-year-old 
Michael Brown. Hundreds of people 
from Washtenaw County and the 
University gathered on the Diag 
in solidarity with people fighting 
against oppression in Ferguson, 
Palestine and Mexico.

Most importantly, we gathered 

and 
marched 
for 
Aura 
and 
 

her family.

While 
we 
were 
organizing, 

Michigan State Police investigated 
Ried’s use of lethal force. On Jan. 
30, Washtenaw County Prosecutor 
Brian Mackie declared that Ried 
“acted in lawful self-defense.” Ann 
Arbor Mayor Christopher Taylor 
released a statement on his Facebook 
page 
the 
evening 
of 
Mackie’s 

announcement. He continued the 
city’s policy of evasion in response 
to the killing. He also denied that 
racism played a factor. Taylor called 
Rosser’s death a “tragedy of mental 
illness and drug abuse unabated.” 
Then he claimed that the killing was 
“not the tragedy of racism,” which 
was “loathsome and unacceptable to 
everything Ann Arbor and the Ann 
Arbor police stands for.”

Ironically, as Taylor denied that 

race played a factor in Rosser’s 
death, his actions only illustrated 
how much the city and county 
government’s response to her death 
resembled that of the authorities in 
St. Louis, Cleveland and New York 
City, all of which exonerated police 
officers for killing Black Americans 

and then downplayed the fact that 
police officers kill Black Americans 
at a disproportionate rate.

It has been one year since Aura 

Rosser’s death. I wish I had more 
positive news to report. Unfortu-
nately, I do not. The city has not 
apologized for Rosser’s death. The 
city did not take any responsibility 
for her death. Ried was not fired. 
Rosser’s family is still waiting 
 

for justice.

Last December, the city of 

Ann Arbor announced it would 
invest $174,000 in body cam-
eras and upgrades to in-car vid-
eos. Then-Police Chief John Seto 
also announced he was reviewing 
diversity training programs for 
officers. The AAPD has neither 
publicly acknowledged whether or 
not these trainings were instituted 
nor whether the trainings would 
be mandatory for all officers. The 
cost for body cameras comprises 
less than 1 percent of the city’s pro-
posed $25 million police budget for 
2016. And while body cameras are a 
step in a positive direction, no one 
should forget that police cameras 
caught police officers shooting and 
killing Samuel DeBose in Cincin-
nati, Ohio, Ricardo Diaz-Zeferino 
in Gardena, Calif., and in Sandra 
Bland’s arrest in Texas. 

The City of Ann Arbor has failed 

to take any measures that could 
further illuminate how it can prevent 
future police shootings of Black 
Americans. The city has dragged 
its feet considering whether or not 
it would establish a civilian review 
board to oversee law enforcement. 
We protested. We organized. We 
know city leaders were aware of our 
presence. They heard us protest, but 
they failed to listen.

The city’s unwillingness to apolo-

gize to the Rosser family and the slow 
pace of policy change provokes one to 
ask: Does Aura Rosser’s life matter? 
Did her life matter to the mayor who 
refused to allow a community activ-
ist to use her three minute speaking 
time at a city council meeting for a 
moment of silence? Did it matter to 
the prosecutor who declared that 
her killing was justified? Does it mat-
ter to the local government who has 
moved too slowly to reform the city’s 
police practices?

I also wonder if Rosser’s life 

mattered to the University. Ried 
shot Rosser on Seto’s watch, the 
same person who the University 
recently hired as director of housing 
security. 
Meanwhile, 
Rosser’s 

family waits for justice.

Some may ask what justice would 

look like after a police officer shoots 
and kills a citizen. Ultimately, if 
the City of Ann Arbor wants to 
lead on the issue, it must do so by 
reorienting its justice systems away 
from punishment to restorative 
measures. This would include the 
city formally apologizing to Rosser’s 
family for her death, paying for 
Rosser’s funeral costs to relieve the 
family of undue burden and firing 
Ried. Doing all, or a combination of 
any of these tasks, surely would not 
resurrect Rosser from her grave. But 
performing these acts of contrition 
could have gone a long way toward 
healing the family and rebuilding 
trust between the police and the 
Ann Arbor community, especially 
the city’s Black residents.

The absence of restorative justice 

is why we have marched, blocked 
intersections, and shut down city 
streets and City Council meetings. 
One does not perform these acts if 
authorities listen and take citizens’ 
demands seriously. One does not 
engage in civil disobedience if the 
system is just. We will continue to 
act to keep the spirits of Rosser and 
other Black women who have died at 
the hands of police and armed citi-
zens in Southeast Michigan, such 
as 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley Jones 
and 19-year-old Renisha McBride. 
We will not stop until Black wom-
en’s lives matter to the University, 
Washtenaw County and the state of 
Michigan. Authorities should rise to 
the challenge of #BlackLivesMatter.

This nation is always looking for 

inspiring leadership. But if local 
leaders continue to fail to act with 
urgency, then we will push them. 
The longer Rosser’s family has to 
wait for justice, the longer we wait 
for changes to the local justice sys-
tem, the more we will demand. That 
is how protest movements work.

ham student and an organizer

Pretending to “Free the Nipple”

FROM THE DAILY

Michigan must ban the box

Disclosure of criminal history shouldn’t deter employers
O 

n Nov. 2, President Barack Obama announced a new executive 
order to “ban the box,” a check-off on federal job applications 
that requires job seekers to disclose their criminal history. 

Without having to make a stigmatizing confession that often 
causes employers to eliminate applicants before even considering 
qualifications, former prisoners are able to reenter society with greater 
ease. Unfortunately, there’s a direct statistical link between “the box” 
and the under-employment of former convicts, which encourages 
recidivism. While background checks would still happen, employers 
would conduct them late enough in the hiring process that they 
would not be preemptively disqualifying applicants. Eliminating this 
disclosure requirement exemplifies good policy on behalf of the Obama 
administration — the kind that produces positive change.

All of the 2016 Democratic presidential 

candidates have endorsed banning the box, 
and at least one of the Republican candidates 
supports the initiative. New Jersey Gov. 
Chris Christie (R) signed a “ban the box” 
bill into law in 2014. A recent article in the 
National Law Review reported that 19 other 
states and more than 100 cities have passed 
similar legislation.

The National Employment Law Project 

estimates that 70 million Americans have 
a criminal record — almost one-third of all 
working-age adults. The United States, which 
represents 5 percent of the global population, 
possesses one-quarter of the world’s prison 
population. More than 600,000 inmates 
are released from prison every year, and 
according to the Department of Justice, 
between 60 and 75 percent of them will still 
be unemployed one year later.

The box Obama proposes to ban — as some 

of the largest employers in the United States, 
including Wal-Mart and Target, have already 
done — is just one thread in the fabric of 
systemic racism within the U.S. judicial system.

In 2003, an experiment by Devah Pager, 

a 
sociology 
professor 
at 
Northwestern 

University, showed how that works. In her 
study, two-person teams of Black and white 
men from Milwaukee applied for entry-
level jobs with 350 employers. Each pair had 
equivalent resumes and qualifications, the 
salient difference between them being that 
one of them had a criminal record. Pager’s 
finding, which should surprise no one, was 
that those with criminal records were half 
as likely to be asked back for an interview as 
those without.

The 
data 
from 
Pager’s 
experiment 

produced shocking results about race. Of 
those with no criminal history, employers 
asked 34 percent of white applicants back for 
another interview, but only asked 14 percent of 
Black applicants — an even lower percentage 
than the 17 percent of white applicants asked 
back despite admitting to a criminal record. 
Of Black applicants who admitted having a 
criminal record, only 5 percent were called 
back for another interview.

On top of the persistent racism that Blacks 

face in applying for jobs, flaws in the criminal 
justice system make it more likely for Blacks 
to be incarcerated and have to check the 
box in the first place. According to figures 
compiled by the NAACP, African Americans 

are six times more likely to be incarcerated 
than whites. Five times as many whites 
as African Americans are drug users, but 
African Americans are sentenced to jail for 
drug offenses at a rate 10 times that of whites. 
African Americans and Hispanics, who make 
up only one quarter of the total population, 
represented 58 percent of the U.S. prison 
population as of 2008.

The reasons for such statistics are manifold 

and well known, a product of discriminatory 
practices such as mandatory sentencing, 
“three strikes” policies and the legal disparity 
between crack and powder cocaine.

The good news is that the American system 

of mass incarceration is no longer a partisan 
issue. Three of the leading conservatives in 
the U.S. Senate — Chuck Grassley (R–Iowa), 
Mike Lee (R–Utah) and Rand Paul (R–Ky.) 
— support sentencing reform that would, at 
least, begin to reduce the prison population.

Without limiting the ability of employers 

to hire the best candidates, the federal 
government has the duty under the law to 
prevent discrimination in hiring practices. 
The 
Equal 
Employment 
Opportunity 

Commission’s Guidance on the Consideration 
of 
Arrest 
or 
Conviction 
Records 
in 

Employment 
Decisions 
states 
that 
“an 

employer’s use of an individual’s criminal 
history in making employment decisions may 
… violate the prohibition against employment 
discrimination under Title VII of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964.”

In other words, directly disregarding an 

application based on criminal history can 
bring about legal action by the EEOC.

State governments, including Michigan’s, 

must accept the same responsibility. Banning 
the box is only a start, but it’s an important step 
— not only for those who lose out when they 
have to check the box, but also for those who 
are discouraged from even applying for a job 
because they know that their criminal record 
will prevent them from being considered.

As citizens, we share that responsibility 

with our elected representatives, and as 
University students, we should, at the very 
least, urge the adoption of “ban the box” 
legislation for both public and private 
employers statewide. Detroit, Kalamazoo, 
Muskegon County and Saginaw County 
have already adopted “ban the box” policies. 
The state legislature should lose no time in 
following suit.

Arctic Monkeys: 
A perf teen band

Alex Turner turned 

me on to British 
indie power-snark

By ADAM THEISEN

Senior Arts Editor

Arctic Monkeys had every-

thing you want out of music 
when you’re just becoming a 
teenager: relatable lyrics, huge 
choruses and a hot-as-hell lead 
singer with an accent. They 
caught on ridiculously quick in 
the U.K., where Whatever People 
Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not 
became the fastest-selling debut 
record in the country’s history, 
but their highest charting single 
in the U.S. is 2013’s “Do I Wanna 
Know,” which only peaked at no. 
70. I found Arctics through the 
mind-reading streaming service 
Pandora — a site I have remained 
intensely loyal to ever since—
when I was in eighth grade, and 
from then on, even with friends 
who mostly listened to indie 
rock and pop punk, I felt like I 
was privy to a huge secret, the 
only one in America who could 
find the band’s hometown of 
Sheffield on a map of England or 
knew what the phrase “Mardy 
Bum” meant.

To some, this alone might 

disqualify 
me 
from 
calling 

myself a hardcore fan, but I only 
ever learned two of the band 
members’ names — there’s the 
cyclone that is Matt Helders on 
drums, and there’s Alex Turner 
on vocals. That’s okay, though, 
because — at least to young me — 
Turner was everything. He was 
the voice that had full control 
over every wild track, he was the 
dude with the messy hair and 
gorgeous eyes looking out from 
magazine covers, and he was the 
ever-cool frontman I fell in love 
with. When Turner was singing 
about being snarky to cops or 
cutting down a pretentious rival 
or throwing a tantrum because 
a bouncer wouldn’t let him into 
a club, I was right behind him, 

agreeing with every word he said 
and just listening in wonder-
ment at the fact that you could 
be sarcastic or clever or just a 
complete dickhead in a song and 
make it sound like poetry. Early 
Arctics is like Oscar Wilde front-
ing The Strokes — just a char-
ismatic beauty with a hilarious 
superiority complex asserting 
his dominance over brilliantly 
in-sync garage guitars. Even 
though, at the time, I couldn’t 
totally put into words why I was 
so obsessed with Turner, he was 
always the magnetic presence 
that put Arctic Monkeys miles 
ahead of their contemporaries.

I could probably write a full 

article on every single song 
from Whatever…’s lineup, but 
key to the whole enterprise was 
“I Bet You Look Good on the 
Dancefloor,” the lead single that 
announced the arrival of the 
world’s next rock stars. Post-
modern with its Duran Duran 
and 
Shakespeare 
references 

while utterly timeless in its tale 
— boy meets girl, boy wants to 
fuck girl — “Dancefloor” was 
indie cleverness mixed with 
mainstream rock force. It’s 
impossible to ignore, a perfect-
for-any-occasion party-starter 
that everyone loved.

But 
it 
was 
“A 
Certain 

Romance,” the album’s final 
song, that closed its grip on my 
heart. Set up more theatrically 
than any of the sub-three-min-
ute pop songs on the rest of the 
record, a long drumroll and some 
pretty guitar strumming open 
the curtain on the singer. Young 
Alex Turner does this amazing 
thing with his voice where he 
doesn’t lose a lick of his working-
class Dickens character accent 
when he sings, making the first 
verse just a delightful swoon-
worthy run of pronunciations 
like “poonch” for “punch” and 
“int” for “isn’t.” That local color 
is perfect for the scene, because 
Turner spends the song wander-
ing some bar in his hometown, 
loving the assholes who are his 
old friends and scrapping with 

the ones who aren’t. It’s just a 
short survey, a quick lookaround 
of the band’s roots, and yet that 
song still stands up as one of 
their best, the sport of bold work 
that tells you everything you 
need to know about an artist to 
realize that they’re something 
special.

I finally fulfilled my dream 

of seeing Arctic Monkeys live 
about a year and a half ago, and 
it was everything I wanted and 
more, but I don’t think they’re 
my favorite band anymore. 
That’s always a weird thing 
to just decide, but Whatever 
People Say I Am, That’s What 
I’m Not, in particular, is one of 
those records I have committed 
to memory and don’t really 
pull out for listening very 
much anymore. Writing this 
piece, I have found that I still 
remember it all perfectly, from 
the overlaps in the guitar parts 
to Matt Helders’s early flashes 
of virtuosity on drums, but 
Turner’s not quite the idol I once 
thought he was. To be honest, if 
I was a Sheffielder who knew 
young Alex Turner, I’d probably 
still love him, but I’d also hate 
his guts. As frenetic and fun 
as the record is, it’s just a little 
juvenile to love unconditionally 
forever.

But the more I think about it, 

the more I think I understand 
why almost nobody goes on to 
marry the first person they love. 
It’s an exciting, world-opening 
event to discover a person or a 
new thing that makes you feel 
amazed and special, but usu-
ally that happens when you still 
have a lot of growing left to do. 
Whatever People Say I Am was 
a beautiful whirlwind of new 
realizations, a huge marker in 
my young life that I memorized 
front to back, wrapping my ears 
around every guitar arrange-
ment, backing vocal and beau-
tifully British turn of phrase, 
and though I still get chills of 
nostalgia when I hear it today, 
I’m happy that I’m not still tied 
down to it.

Mixed results for top 
broadcast networks

TV NOTEBOOK

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

Now that it’s November, it 

seems like the right time to take a 
step back and reflect on the highs 
and lows of this season’s network 
ratings. Overall, they have been 
a mixed bag for broadcast net-
works. Though there have been 
sizeable hits, there have been too 
many new shows that are either 
scoring average or poor numbers 
to call this season a success.

ABC has found some winners 

in its lineup, but the disappoint-
ments are not small. This is par-
ticularly true for “The Muppets,” 
whose ratings have been nothing 
short of a letdown. The show pre-
miered nicely, bringing in 9 mil-
lion viewers and a 2.9 rating in the 
18-49 demographic. However, the 
ratings only declined from there, 
stabilizing at 4 million view-
ers and a 1.4 demo rating. That 
can’t be what ABC was imagin-
ing when they ordered the series 
and gave the show all the promo-
tion they could, pitching it to the 
same audience which turned out 
in droves to the 2011 movie. That 
show isn’t the only one which 
ABC is unhappy about. Also, both 
“Blood & Oil” and “Wicked City” 
bombed, with the former earning 
below a 1.0 key-demo rating for 
the past three airings and having 
its episode order cut. The latter 
failed to even hit a 1.0 demo rat-
ing in its series premiere, which 
seemed to dominate every ad 
break on ESPN for the past sev-
eral weeks.

However, ABC does have ele-

ments of its schedule that it can 
celebrate, the most important of 
which is “Quantico.” The show 

stars Priyanka Chopra, who was 
unknown in America but one of 
Bollywood’s biggest stars before 
the series began. Apparently, she 
has a fan base here, too, because 
the show has averaged a 1.7 rat-
ing through its first five airings. 
While that number might not 
be remarkable on its own, it’s a 
50-percent improvement from 
what “Revenge” was doing in 
the Sunday 10 p.m. timeslot last 
season. It has also doubled its 
“Blood & Oil” lead-in on multiple 
occasions.

Because of Thursday Night 

Football, it’s a little early to tell 
the story of CBS’s season. The 
eight weeks of football games 
held back both the majority 
of CBS’s Thursday series and 
its most important new show, 
“Supergirl.” The series flew 
high for CBS in its premiere, 
with 13 million viewers and a 
3.1 in the demo, but one air-
ing is too little to call a show a 
hit. However, the Eye is defi-
nitely celebrating the launch of 
“Limitless,” whose ratings have 
stabilized at 8 million viewers 
and a 1.4 in the key demo. The 
series holds the majority of its 
“NCIS: New Orleans” lead-in 
and has improved the year-to-
year timeslot performance by a 
few tenths (“Person of Interest” 
was in the slot last year).

FOX is lucky that it still has 

“Empire,” which is saving the 
schedule from being a complete 
letdown. That show is still a 
massive ratings giant, averag-
ing a 5.36 through its first four 
airings. That number makes it 
the top scripted show on net-
work television right now. How-
ever, the rest of FOX’s schedule 

has underperformed. Several of 
their returning shows are facing 
year-over-year declines, includ-
ing “Gotham,” which is running 
about 30 percent below what it 
was doing last fall. “Sleepy Hol-
low” has also scored series lows 
most weeks of the new season. In 
addition, “Minority Report” had 
the distinction of being the first 
outright bomb of the season — 
opening to a 1.1 18-49 rating and 
declining from there.

But the biggest disappoint-

ment 
of 
FOX’s 
schedule 
is 

“Scream 
Queens.” 
The 
cast 

includes big names like Jamie 
Lee Curtis, Nick Jonas and Ari-
ana Grande who have fan bases 
from past work, and the network 
gave the show a huge market-
ing push, with ads for the show 
airing as far back as February. 
Though the series adds another 
50 percent to its live rating when 
a week’s worth of DVR viewing 
is factored in, the most recent 
airing earned a paltry 1.0 18-49 
rating, which is low no matter 
which measure you use. It might 
squeak out a renewal because of 
creator Ryan Murphy’s pedigree 
and the love for him in the FOX 
Networks Group, but it won’t be 
because of ratings.

The one big caveat to every-

thing mentioned here: It’s still 
early in the season, and a lot of 
this season’s story has yet to be 
told. It’s possible that midsea-
son series can help some falling 
schedules (especially for FOX, 
which has both “American Idol” 
and a revival of “The X-Files” 
waiting in the wings). However, 
the fall picture is fairly clear at 
this point, and it’s certainly tell-
ing a story of ups and downs.

MY FIRST FAVORITE ALBUM

I

’m greedy. I’m predomi-
nantly greedy in regards to 
food and sleep (that thing 

I really want that I never seem 
to have). Though after further 
self-exami-
nation, I’ve 
discovered 
my insatiable 
greed for 
any episte-
mological 
knowledge 
that’s even 
tangentially 
fashion-
related, but 
it’s a curse. I 
endlessly read and painstakingly 
reread anything and everything 
industry-centric to the point 
where it all melds together in 
my mind. Striving for sensibil-
ity, I then resort to staring at 
my magazine cutout-clad wall 
to remind myself why I pine for 
every morsel of insight on this 
hectic, unpredictable and elusive 
sphere. Even a quick glance to 
my makeshift wallpaper reminds 
me why fashion is where I need 
to work (read: live, it’s 2015) and 
breathe. Though I’ll admit to 
cancelling plans and arrange-
ments out of sheer greediness to 
absorb the ins and outs of what I 
intend to pursue, I know my self-
indulgence isn’t always worth 
forgoing a shot at fun (or a round 
of shots, for the record). 

 Though I complain about 

not having enough time for 
X, Y and Z, it turns out I do. I 
greedily prioritize what I really 
want to dwell on, whether it’s 
outsourcing inspiration for my 
next column or printing out that 
NYT recipe for vegan brownies 
and contemplating the perks 
and drawbacks of adapting the 
diet. I have these luxuries, these 
greed-tinged 
little 
luxuries. 

Ironically, the frontrunners of 
the luxury fashion world can’t 
even find time for luxury.

 When I began my fashion-

arced odyssey in high school, I 
came across a Tom Ford OWN 
documentary 
on 
YouTube. 

In the opening monologue, 
Ford speaks candidly about 
his infamous career burnout 
that 
prompted 
his 
partly 

autobiographical 
directorial 

debut of 2009. After designing 

16 collections annually and 
alternating 
between 
Yves 

Saint Laurent and Gucci, he 
was lethargic, drained and 
uninspired. 

 “I didn’t know who I was, I 

didn’t know who I was supposed 
to be,” he says, reflecting on the 
dark ages. 

 With his film rendition of 

Christopher Isherwood’s novel 
“A Single Man,” Ford told the 
calamitous tale of his midlife 
crisis, 
albeit 
concealed 
by 

stunning cinematography and 
Julianne Moore and Colin Firth 
equally slaying ’60s wardrobes. 
He translated both his lost 
direction and irretrievable time 
onto the screen. By drawing 
a veil of beauty over the 
unfavorable realities, he echoed 
the general trends of fashion’s 
business tactics. We so often 
forget that simple fact behind 
the gems and silhouettes — the 
truth that fashion, at the end of 
the day, is a business. 

 A later jaunt in my solo 

fashion research led me to 
a Ford maxim — “Time and 
silence are the most luxurious 
things today” — words that have 
recently reverberated in the 
wake of two prominent French 
creative directors abdicating 
their 
couturier 
thrones. 

Two weeks ago, Raf Simons 
announced 
his 
departure 

from Dior, an unexpected exit 
to say the least. Particularly 
evinced throughout the spring 
documentary 
‘Dior 
and 
I,’ 

Simons was the brand’s perfect 
fit, requiring zero alterations. 
He 
honed 
his 
indelible 

creativity and maintained an 
unmatched synchronicity from 
collection to collection. But he 
ultimately decided to focus on 
his eponymous label after three 
glorious years at the house. 

 After Alber Elbaz accepted 

his 
well-deserved 
Superstar 

award at the recent Fashion 
Group International Night of 
Stars, he commended Simons’ 
choice in earnest and alluded to 
his own impending departure 
from the helm of Lanvin. Aware 
of his speech’s time constraints, 
Elbaz opened with a retort: “I 
need more time,” he said. “And 
I think everybody in fashion 
these days needs just a little 

more time.”

 When I first read Elbaz’s 

words in the Women’s Wear 
Daily review of the night, I 
recalled Ford’s adage, “Time 
and 
silence 
are 
the 
most 

luxurious things today.” Elbaz’s 
speech 
wasn’t 
merely 
him 

gracing the audience with his 
signature wisdom and wit; it 
was a sartorial call to action, a 
refrain from ‘luxurious’ silence. 
He exhausted the exhaustion 
of 
fashion’s 
relentless 
pace 

impinging 
on 
the 
creative 

process, along with reminding 
the audience of a designer’s 
constant time crunch — the 
elite required to churn out six 
collections annually, often six 
months before their intended 
season. A few days after, Elbaz 
announced his departure after 
14 years at Lanvin. 

On 
the 
endless 
list 
of 

designers 
I 
research 
and 

pretend to know on a personal 
level, Raf and Alber have been 
tied second for years (sorry 
boys, Ford stole my heart during 
the formative years). But within 
my own sophomoric sartorial 
pursuits, I sense the pressure 
on 
the 
industry’s 
doyens 

sublimated into the pressure I 
put on myself to keep up with 
its ever-accelerating pace. 

 Like any art form, fashion is 

complex and irreducible. Before 
a 
collection’s 
debut, 
which 

demands an ample digestion 
and 
appreciation 
period 

for the masses, it requires 
weeks, months, years or even 
lifetimes worth of inspiration 
and planning, but above all, a 
designer’s heart and soul. I can 
only image that with amended 
annual requirements and an 
augmented time window to 
explore creative triggers, my 
beloved, 
wunderkind 
and 

pretend-friend designers can 
reclaim their identities and 
better imbue them into every 
collection. I’m confident that 
Elbaz’s industry critique will 
catalyze much needed change. 
Until then, I’ll hold on to my 
luxuries.

Turning five with 
‘No Strings Attached’

MY FIRST FAVORITE ALBUM

By KEN SELANDER

Daily Arts Writer

The year was 2000. The 

date was August 12. It was 
my fifth birthday. I had a 
birthday 
present 
list, 
and 

atop that treasured piece of 
parchment 
was 
the 
album 

holding the beloved “Bye Bye 
Bye.” Admittedly, I thought the 
Backstreet Boys sung the track, 
but my friend was smart enough 
to do some research and find 
that the song was performed by 
NSYNC, the other prominent 
boy band of the era.

I was ecstatic when I found 

the No Strings Attached CD 
— remember CDs? — among 
my presents. The cover art is 
standard boy band material. 
After my party I cracked it open 
and inserted it into my bulky, 
green CD player and listened. I 
think we can all agree: having 
the No Strings Attached CD was 
as cool as it got in kindergarten.

And don’t lie to me — you 

know that shit is still hot. “Bye 
Bye Bye” is the opening track, 
and I was immediately satisfied 
to hear what I considered 
the hottest song in the world. 
“Just Got Paid” and “Bringin’ 
da Noise” were solid hype-
up songs to jam to in the car 
before soccer games. You know, 
the kind where the goals were 
little prop-up nets and half of 
the team stands around picking 
dandelions. 
Upon 
further 

listening, “Space Cowboy” was 

decidedly my other favorite 
song with its twangy pop 
sound. The family room in my 
house has high ceilings, and 
I remember throwing pillows 
high in the air while dancing 
around to the record. I probably 
definitely tried to beatbox at 
some point, too.

What’s past is past. At least 

I didn’t keep thinking it was 
something worthwhile to spend 
my free time doing past the first 
grade and into high school. My 
NSYNC CD listening prime took 
place during a simpler time. 
Granted, I could still sing along 
to five of the songs with reason-
able accuracy, but that’s beside 
the point. Just as I remem-
ber standing outside at recess 

around the start of first grade, 
reminiscing with my classmate 
Cooper on the joys of Kinder-
garten — namely having two 
recesses — I am now a senior in 
college with lots of good memo-
ries of college rooted in music.

There’s waking up at 7:30 

a.m. for football tailgates to the 
sound of Thin Lizzy or DMX 
before any other students in 
the city seem to have awoken, 
shouting along to Sugarland 
with friends late at night, or just 
walking around our beautiful 
campus with the Arctic Mon-
keys or J Cole in my earbuds. 
While my new musical memo-
ries only infrequently include 
NSYNC, they still bring me back 
to a more carefree time.

Workplace feminism 
in ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ 

By DANIELLE YACOBSON

Daily Arts Writer

Confession: After 10 loyal years, 

I almost quit “Grey’s Anatomy.” 
Killing off one too many of my 
favorite characters seeded my 
deep-rooted 
grudge 
against 

the producers, and the angsty, 
back-and-forth 
relationships 

were making me question the 
legitimacy of love altogether. But 
as I looked for an excuse to distract 
from my newly acquired adult 
responsibilities, I decided to give it 
another shot. Much to my surprise, 
season 12 has been rocking my 
world. Exploding with Girl Power, 
the latest season of “Grey’s” is 
channeling the unstoppable force 
of the head women in charge as 
they unapologetically take on 
their 
tumultuous 
professional 

and personal lives in full stride. 
Spending 42 minutes with Grey-
Sloan Memorial Hospital’s posse 
every week is feminist gold, as the 
women fearlessly run the medical 
world one surgery at a time.

Obviously, 
spoilers 
for 
the 

entirety of “Grey’s Anatomy” 
follow.

Season 12 starts up a year after 

Derek’s (Patrick Dempsey, “Made 
of Honor”) death, and Meredith 
Grey’s (Ellen Pompeo, “Daredev-
il”) flawless opening monologue 
could not encapsulate this sea-
son’s theme better: “Maybe you’re 
wondering, why are we here? But 
I promise, you’re about to find out 
that everything has changed.” 
As it’s hard to imagine a world 
where Meredith and Derek are 
not together, the show takes this 
opportunity to shift the focus 
away from a glamorized quest of 
finding the perfect soul mate and 
instead illuminates life after a 
fairy-tale romance. In interviews, 
Pompeo dedicates this season to 
widowers as she explores their 
stories through Meredith’s emo-
tional recovery. The 12th season 
is all about Meredith finding her 
way again, and so far, she exempli-
fies the formidable strength that 
women can possess on their own. 
Acknowledging that the wild and 
passionate chapter of her life has 
closed, Meredith is able to find 

Experimenting 
with 
the 

supernatural, David Mitchell 
departs from the fantasy genres 
of 
his 

previous 
novels 
and tries 
his hand 
at horror.

“It’s 

a 
genre 

to which 
I 
am 
a 

stranger,” 
confessed 
Mitch-
ell in an interview with The 
Michigan Daily. “I’m entering 
the territory of Stephen King, 
Shirley Jetson and other writ-
ers inspired by them, and I am a 
sojourner in this territory.”

Sojourner or not, Mitchell 

crafts five short stories of hor-
ror and intrigue that are artfully 
combined under a story arc that 
pulls the reader through a maze of 
trickery and disbelief.

A 
detailed 
and 
organized 

writer, Mitchell has always had 
his thoughts thoroughly planned 
out before embarking on his next 
novel. But upon the release of “The 
Bone Clocks” in 2014, Mitchell 
took to a brand new writing plat-
form and experimented with the 
140 character limit of Twitter.

“I was curious as to whether it 

would work or not,” said Mitchell. 
“My thought was to kick it around 
for a story.”

Over the course of 208 tweets in 

July 2014, Mitchell wrote a short 
story that eventually evolved into 
the first of five stories introducing 
the world to Slade House. From 
the perspective of Nathan Bishop, 
a 
Valium-popping 
13-year-old, 

we’re introduced to Slade House 
and the horrors that lie within. 
The supernatural creatures that 
occupy the mansion are over 100 
years old and draw in their vic-
tims by creating a false reality to 
captivate them. Bright colors and 
potential friendship are the two 
comforts that lure Nathan in, for 
they’re the comforts that are so 
evidently lacking in his home life.

“I wanted to look for a reason 

within the story and within the 
characters to use Twitter. The 
solution I hit upon was to have a 
kid who’s possibly Asperger’s or 
on the autistic spectrum, because 
it’s hard for him to handle reality; 
it’s a kind of sludgy, unkind mess 
for him. He’s stealing his mom’s 
Valium tablets, which slow down 
his bandwidth for reality, so his 
mind must process them into 
much more handleable pulses or 
packets of informations, which are 
the tweets.”

Similar to his previous books, 

Mitchell addresses the theme of 

immortality and how society and 
humans approach the subject. The 
villains of this novel are fueled by 
the souls of their victims, and, as if 
to torment us, Mitchell allows us 
to grow familiar with each man, 
woman and child before they fall 
into the two demons’ clutches. 
The twin brother and sister that 
serve as the novel’s antagonists are 
plagued by their mortality, which 
causes them to commit heinous 
murders to achieve immortality.

“Our culture does not equip us 

very well to look mortality in the 
face and to establish a produc-
tive working relationship with 
it,” Mitchell said. “All our culture 
really has to offer on the subject is 
fear, but fear is not healthy. It’s not 
a good state of affairs that we are 
terrified of the one thing that will 
inevitably happen to all of us.”

There’s a taboo on mortal-

ity in our society, one that pre-
vents us from facing the truth. 
Demonstrated through Mitch-
ell’s monsters, humans will go 
to great lengths and resort to 
unspeakable deeds to remain in 
this state of denial.

Although Mitchell explores a 

fantastical world full of super-
natural misdeeds and missteps, 
he incorporates a humane aspect 
into the genre. The morals he tries 
to communicate to the reader are 
evident in his approach to moral-
ity and the consequences faced if 
one continues to reject it.

“I look at mortality from the 

other side, from the viewpoint 
of immortals. I look at the whole 
subject and look from their point 
of view on how death is a part of 
life, how death actually enhances 
life and how the fact that we are 
finite and know we’re finite makes 
all the colors colorful as they are,” 
Mitchell said.

Differing from his previous 

novels, “Slade House” is notice-
ably shorter than its predecessor 
“The Bone Clocks,” or his most 
well known work “Cloud Atlas,” 
which average 500 to 600 pages. 
At 237 pages, “Slade House” is 
noticeably short, but it doesn’t fail 
capture the universe Mitchell has 
created through his books.

Recurring 
characters 
and 

subjects can be found in each of 
Mitchell’s books, regardless of 
whether the subject matter is the 
same, and this novel is no excep-
tion. But this shouldn’t be a point 
of concern for first time David 
Mitchell readers. Mitchell encour-
ages even his companion novels to 
be read and enjoyed independent-
ly of the others.

“If you haven’t read ‘The Bone 

Clocks,’ then this is an entrée, if 
you have read ‘The Bone Clocks’ 
then this is the dessert. If you 
haven’t read ‘The Bone Clocks’ 
and never plan on reading ‘The 
Bone Clocks’ then (Slade House) 
is a – I hope – delightful stand-
alone dish.”

genuine happiness without relying 
on a man, challenging the societal 
assumption that women can only 
be fulfilled in the presence of a 
budding love life.

As the landscape of the hospital 

changes, season 12 features a lead-
ing team of mostly female depart-
ment heads. With the exception of 
Trauma and Plastics, the chief sur-
geons are all women, and Miranda 
Bailey’s (Chandra Wilson) rise to 
chief of surgery shows just how 
powerful women in small pack-
ages can be. Their leadership and 
“tough calls” go unquestioned, 
and their authority is a force to be 
reckoned with. “Grey’s Anatomy” 
shows that women can take on the 
most demanding jobs with just as 
much respect as men.

Feminism in the workplace does 

not stop there. One of the most real-
life scenarios depicted this season 
is Meredith’s lowball promotion 
salary and the hesitation she expe-
riences to confront her superiors. 
In the third episode, “I Choose 
You,” her lacking contract after 
being promoted to chief of gen-
eral surgery shocks the rest of the 
female chiefs, who urge Meredith 
to stand up for what she has earned 
and be compensated adequately 
for her skills. The unconditional 
support of women in the work-
place can be one of the strongest 
catalysts for success, especially in 
high-pressure fields like medicine. 
It’s high time that women started 

asserting themselves and ask-
ing for what they want instead of 
expecting to be rewarded on their 
own. Meredith’s composed and 
confident negotiation is exactly 
how women should be advocating 
for themselves, refusing to accept 
anything less than they deserve.

“Grey’s” wouldn’t be what it is 

without workplace romances, and 
nothing has changed now that the 
women are in charge. In fact, many 
of the female chiefs are now the 
superiors of their significant oth-
ers. Bailey’s husband is a resident 
and Maggie (Kelly McCreary) is 
starting up a ship-worthy relation-
ship with an intern. In both cases, 
the power dynamic has never been 
exploited. Instead, displayed on 
screen are functional relation-
ships that are grounded in mutual 
respect for each other’s work.

“Grey’s Anatomy” is not the 

show that I once knew and loved. 
The majority of the original cast 
has left (let’s be real — they were 
killed off) and the ones that have 
remained are significantly older 
and are dealing with issues that I 
(hopefully) won’t have to worry 
about for at least another couple 
of decades. Season 12 is different, 
but good different. As the show 
has evolved, the focus shifted to 
encapsulate some of today’s most 
pressing feminist issues, allowing 
viewers to look through a different 
lens at the doctors we have gotten 
to know over the past 10 years.

WOMEN’S SOCCER
‘M’ seeks new narrative in 
Big Ten tourney semifinals

By BETELHEM ASHAME

Daily Sports Writer

Three minutes. That’s all it 

took for then-No. 10 Penn State 
to score three unanswered goals 
to end the Michigan women’s 
soccer 
team’s 

regular season 
last Wednesday 
night. With the 
3-1 win, Penn 
State 
clinched 

the No. 1 seed 
in the Big Ten 
Tournament, 
while 
sending 

Michigan 
tumbling down 
to fifth in the 
final conference 
standings.

That 

might’ve been the story a week 
ago, but plenty can change in 
seven days. Fast forward to 
Sunday afternoon, when the 
Wolverines took on No. 4 seed 
Northwestern in the Big Ten 
Tournament quarterfinals.

Going into Evanston for a 

winner-take-all 
showdown, 

Michigan needed a tremendous 
team effort to keep its season 
and its hopes of reaching the 
NCAA Tournament alive. And 
the team delivered with a gritty 
performance ripe with heart and 
fire, walking away with a 1-0 
victory off a goal by junior forward 
Nicky Waldeck. Coincidentally, 
the score line mimicked the 
Wolverines’ win over the then-
22nd-ranked Wildcats at U-M 
Soccer Stadium a month prior.

A familiar foe now awaits 

in the conference tournament 
semifinals, where the Wolverines 
will face off against none other 
than the Nittany Lions. With a 
place in the Big Ten championship 
game on the line, Michigan is 
hoping for a completely different 
story this time around.

“I think Penn State got our 

worst performance, so we’re 
preparing to give them our best 
performance on Friday night,” 
said Michigan coach Greg Ryan. 
“I’m very confident we’re going 
to bounce back and play so much 
better. Playing them once already 
really helps us know exactly what 

we’re up against. We know what 
and how they will probably play. 
This time, we’re in a much better 
position to go out there and give 
ourselves a chance to move on in 
the Big Ten Tournament.”

In 
their 
fourth 
straight 

appearance 
at 
the 
Big 
Ten 

Tournament, the Wolverines now 
advance to the semifinals for the 
first time since 2012. Considering 
that they have not reached the 
championship match since the 
turn of the century, Friday night’s 
match against Penn State looms 
even 
larger. 
Fortunately 
for 

Michigan, it is well-equipped to 
take on the challenge.

This group of Wolverines is 

a loaded bunch. Senior captain 
and defender Christina Murillo 
is second in the Big Ten with 
seven 
assists, 
while 
redshirt 

sophomore forward Ani Sarkisian 
and sophomore forward Taylor 
Timko are tied for seventh in 
the conference with seven goals 
apiece. Over half of Michigan’s 
roster 
has 

contributed 
a 

point so far this 
season, 
while 

11 Wolverines 
have netted at 
least one goal. 
Four 
players 

have 
double-

digit 
points 

— 
Timko 

and Sarkisian are tied with 17, 
while freshman midfielder Abby 
Kastroll and senior forward Lulu 
Haidar are tied with 12.

That 
doesn’t 
even 
include 

the 
Wolverines’ 
defensive 

dominance. Michigan has shut 
out nine opponents this season, 
including three of its last four, 
and has conceded just 19 goals 
while allowing an average of just 
seven shots per game. Coupled 
with 36 goals scored to date, the 
Wolverines boast an impressive 
plus-17 scoring margin. But the 
defense failed to contain Penn 
State in its previous game and 
must play significantly better 
in order for Michigan to be 
victorious.

“We don’t really have to 

change what we do, we just have 
to execute better,” Ryan said. 
“We have to defend better as a 

back line. We gave away some 
pretty easy goals that would have 
been fairly easy for us to defend. 
Against a high-powered attacking 
team like Penn State, we have to 
be outstanding defensively. We 
have been very good this whole 
year in the back, so I’m very 
confident that we can be.”

Another phase that gave the 

Wolverines problems during the 
first meeting was possession. 
Usually accustomed to dictating 
the run of play, Michigan allowed 
Penn State too much time on the 
ball and too much space in the 
midfield, resulting in three goals 
for the Nittany Lions.

“We really have to turn it on in 

our ability to keep the ball,” Ryan 
said. “We are going to make some 
adjustments to get more players 
around the ball and more players 
a little higher up the park. After 
they scored the first goal, we 
stopped trying to keep the ball 
ourselves. Against Penn State, 
if you give them the ball back 

every 
time, 

you’re going to 
be 
defending 

all night, and 
eventually 
they’re going to 
beat you.”

The 
last 

game left a sour 
taste 
in 
the 

Wolverines’ 

mouths. 
Coming 
off 
a 
big-

time 
performance 
against 

Northwestern, the Wolverines 
are determined to change the 
story this time around.

“That huge win basically came 

down to ‘How hard can we fight?’ 
” said Michigan senior midfielder 
Corinne 
Harris. 
“We 
ended 

up proving that we’re not only 
talented, but we’re a really strong 
team that can play that hard and 
match that level.

“We’re trying to take that level 

of intensity into the Penn State 
game. We’re getting stronger 
in practice, and we’re ready for 
a rematch, because we weren’t 
happy with the way it went 
before.”

Ready to put the past behind 

them, the Wolverines now have 
the opportunity to write a new 
narrative.

Father, son match 
wits in exhibition

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

John Beilein doesn’t typically 

invite opposing coaches over 
to 
his 
house 

after 
games, 

but 
Friday 

will prove an 
exception.

After all, the 

Michigan men’s 
basketball 
coach is going 
up against the 
school 
that 

employed 
him 

for nine years. 
Odder 
still, 

the man now 
running 
the 

show at Division II Le Moyne 
College is Beilein’s son, Patrick.

“I’m going to study my feelings 

during the whole thing,” the 
elder Beilein said Thursday. “It’s 
going to be interesting.”

Though Friday’s exhibition 

is more an opportunity for the 
Wolverines’ reserves to see the 
court than it is a true measuring 
stick, both of the Beileins on the 
floor and the dozens more in the 
stands are taking the basketball 
element seriously.

A record number of family 

members will be in attendance 
at Crisler Center, and Beilein 
expects the majority to be 
rooting for the Dolphins. After 
all, Patrick is one of 44 of 
Beilein’s parents’ grandchildren, 
and Beilein estimated that 12 
to 15 of his nieces and nephews 
— Patrick’s cousins — will be in 
attendance.

“Once the ball goes up — 

Patrick would probably feel the 
same way — his mother could 
be on the other bench, and we’re 
competing,” Beilein said.

The exhibition is an early 

chance for the Wolverines to 
get the entirety of their roster 

involved, especially with several 
players already ruled out. Aside 
from injury concerns, juniors 
Sean Lonergan and Andrew 
Dakich are both considering 
redshirting this season and will 
not play, Beilein said.

But freshman forward Moritz 

Wagner could see substantial 
playing time, and players who 
appear to be on the fringes 
of 
Michigan’s 
rotation, 
like 

sophomore guard Muhammad-
Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman 
and 

redshirt 
sophomore 
forward 

Mark Donnal, will have the 
opportunity to make an early-
season, in-game impression.

The Dolphins, meanwhile, will 

play their second consecutive 
game against an opponent that, at 
least on paper, 
outclasses 
them 
thoroughly. Le 
Moyne 
didn’t 

have to leave 
the city limits 
of Syracuse on 
Nov. 2, falling 
to the Orange 
at the Carrier 
Dome, 97-58.

Of 
course, 

Beilein said, being blown out at 
Syracuse isn’t a problem specific 
to Le Moyne’s Division II status.

“Syracuse can do that to a lot of 

Division I teams in November,” 
Beilein said. “Actually, they do it 
all year long.”

LESS THAN FULL STEAM: 

Junior foward Zak Irvin will 
not play Friday as he continues 
to recover from an offseason 
back procedure, Beilein said. 
Senior guard Spike Albrecht will 
play, though he’s still limited as 
he rehabs from a summer hip 
surgery.

Though the Wolverines are 

by and large healthy, Beilein 
said minor injuries have taken 
a toll on the rhythm and flow of 

practice.

At 
Monday’s 
practice, 

which was open to the public, 
sophomore 
guard 
Aubrey 

Dawkins 
landed 
awkwardly 

on his right ankle after a 
dunk. He returned to practice 
minutes later, but eventually 
headed to the locker room early. 
Nonetheless, he’s expected to 
play Friday.

Beilein also acknowledged, 

cryptically, that the ailments 
of Irvin, Dawkins and Albrecht 
don’t span the list of Michigan’s 
preseason health issues. The 
bumps and bruises make it more 
difficult to establish a rhythm in 
practice, Beilein said.

CONTRACT 

COLLABORATIONS: Beilein’s 

recently 
announced 
contract 
extension, 
which 
will 

keep him in 
Ann 
Arbor 

through 
the 
2020-

21 
season, 

is 
as 
much 

for 
recruits’ 

benefit as it is 

the Wolverines.

Beilein is currently recruiting 

athletes set to graduate in 2017 
or 2018, and they had reasonable 
questions for a man asking them 
to make a four-year commitment.

“It’s a common question for 

’17s and ’18s,” Beilein said. “Your 
contract is up in ’19, but I’m going 
to graduate (high school) in ’17 — 
who’s going to be coaching?”

Once Beilein mentioned his 

concerns to interim Athletic 
Director Jim Hackett, he said 
the process moved quickly, and 
that there was obvious mutual 
interest both from the Athletic 
Department 
and 
University 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
in 

securing the deal.

Everyone remembers what happened the last time Michigan 
played at home: a last-second, 27-23 loss to Michigan State. 
The Wolverines regrouped with an almost-as-thrilling win at 
Minnesota last week, and now they return to Michigan Stadium 
to start the final third of the regular season. This time, they face a 
Rutgers team that shouldn’t give them nearly as much trouble.

Piscataway? We hope not.

UNLV (Sept. 19): More like Loss Vegas.

Indiana (Nov. 14): Boring state. Hopefully not a

Wolverines have opportunity to 
reassert dominance vs. Rutgers

Scarlet Knights 

struggling heading 

into first trip to 

Michigan Stadium

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

Four weeks have passed since 

the No. 17 Michigan football 
team’s 38-0 rout of Northwestern, 
the 
last 
game 

the 
Wolverines 

played 
that 

wasn’t 
close. 

Their two games 
since then have 
hinged on the 
final play.

While 
they 

split 
those 

games, 
their 

dominance was 
gone. 
Saturday 

gives 
them 

a 
chance 
to 

re-establish it.

Rutgers 

(1-4 Big Ten, 3-5 overall) limps 
into Michigan Stadium off two 
straight losses by an average of 
40 points. The Scarlet Knights’ 
first visit to the Big House comes 
against a Michigan team with 
five players, including redshirt 
freshman safety Jabrill Peppers, 
from Rutgers’ home state of New 
Jersey.

The Scarlet Knights rank in 

the bottom half of the country 
in almost every major category, 
including 111th 
in total defense 
and 
100th 
in 

scoring defense. 
The Wolverines 
preyed on such 
teams 
earlier 

this 
season, 

grabbing 
national 
headlines 
and 

moving 
into 

the 
Associated 

Press Top 25 poll along the way.

If the Scarlet Knights aren’t 

careful, Saturday’s game could go 
similarly.

By this point in the season, 

it’s clear that this isn’t the same 
Michigan 
team 
that 
lost 
in 

Piscataway last year. Despite a 
last-second loss to Michigan State 
on Oct. 17, the Wolverines (3-1, 
6-2) have an outside shot in the 
Big Ten title race. They’re more 
efficient on offense, stronger on 
defense and more explosive on 
special teams than they were in 
2014.

“Last year, as we were going 

into the game, I thought they were 
a very physical football team, very 
talented,” said Rutgers coach Kyle 
Flood. “But they play the game 
differently on offense now than 
they did last year, a little bit more 
of a pro-style offense.”

There are a few variables, 

though, that could keep the 
game close if they tilt in Rutgers’ 
favor. One is the health of the 
quarterback who leads Michigan’s 
pro-style offense: fifth-year senior 
Jake Rudock.

Rudock 
left 
Saturday’s 

game against Minnesota after 
sustaining a hard hit in the third 
quarter. 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 

Harbaugh confirmed Monday that 
he does not have a concussion, 
but rather soreness in his ribs 
and back. He said the criteria for 
Rudock playing are that he’s the 
best option in whatever state he’s 
in, and that he will not aggravate 
his injury by playing.

Offensive 
coordinator 
Tim 

Drevno 
indicated 
Wednesday 

those would not be concerns, 
saying Rudock was an active 
participant 
in 
practice 
with 

no 
setbacks. 
Behind 
Rudock, 

redshirt freshman Wilton Speight 
is unproven, even after leading 

a 
comeback 

Saturday. 
If 

Rudock 
can’t 

go or is limited 
Saturday, 
it 

could 
be 
an 

issue.

The running 

game may also 
be a question 
for 
Michigan. 

Junior running 
back 
De’Veon 

Smith limped off Saturday and 
finished with just nine carries, 
though Drevno said he, too, is 
practicing. Fellow junior Ty Isaac 
missed Saturday’s game with what 
Harbaugh called an “internal 
matter.” Harbaugh declined to 

elaborate.

Redshirt junior Drake Johnson 

picked up the slack, carrying 10 
times for 55 yards Saturday, but he 
might be in a tough spot if Green, 
Isaac or both miss this week’s 
game.

Rutgers also has a wild card 

of its own: wide receiver Leonte 
Carroo. A suspension and an injury 
have limited the senior to just five 
games this season, but in those 
contests, he caught 24 passes for 
527 yards and nine touchdowns. 
Carroo 
is 
questionable 
for 

Saturday’s game with a lower-
body injury that sidelined him last 
week against Wisconsin.

Flood said Monday that if 

the game were that day, Carroo 
would not play. He had not yet 
been medically cleared, but if he’s 
a go for Saturday, he’s one of few 
Rutgers players who could give 
Michigan some problems.

But at the end of the day, all 

of those are “ifs.” After thrilling 
finishes in each of their past two 
games, the Wolverines shouldn’t 
have nearly as much trouble this 
week. A more comfortable win is 
more likely, and Michigan could 
use it, too, with tougher games at 
Indiana, at Penn State and versus 
Ohio State in the final quarter of 
the regular-season schedule.

Sam McGuffie, seven 
years removed from 

Michigan, works 

toward Olympic dream

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

When he was growing up in 

Texas in the 1990s and early 2000s, 
Sam McGuffie made sure he never 
missed the gymnastics events in 
the Summer Olympics. He’d sit in 
his living room every four years and 
watch all of the routines, just like 
millions of other Americans.

But what McGuffie did between 

the routines separated him from the 
casual viewer. He’d get up from his 
seat and do gymnastics routines of 
his own, with a few flips here and 
a few cartwheels there. He loved 
listening to the patriotic music 
that accompanied the Olympics on 
television, and he envisioned a day 
when he would be one of the athletes 
on TV.

He’d tell his dad that he was going 

to be in the Olympics some day, so 
his dad asked a natural follow-up: 
What are you going to do?

“I don’t know, whatever,” he’d 

reply.

McGuffie never would have been 

able to guess his most likely path to 
Olympic glory.

For most of his life, McGuffie had 

been a football player and a track 
and field athlete. He played running 

back at Michigan in 2008 before 
transferring to Rice to play football 
and run track and field.

But last week, McGuffie became a 

member of the United States bobsled 
team. It wasn’t a scenario he ever 
envisioned, even as recently as last 
spring. While he still has about two 
years until he can qualify for the 
2018 Olympics in South Korea, he’s 
as close as he possibly could be at 
this stage.

“It’s something you don’t grow up 

saying, ‘I’m going to be a bobsledder,’ 
” McGuffie, 26, said. “It’s kind of 
something that just happened.”

McGuffie spent the 2014 football 

season playing for the Winnipeg Blue 
Bombers of the Canadian Football 
League after bouncing around the 
NFL in 2013. After he left Winnipeg, 
McGuffie returned to Rice to work 
out with former Rice track and field 
assistant coach Casey Thom. His 
primary plan for the offseason was 
to work on his speed.

But then Thom, who had worked 

with McGuffie during his college 
career, brought up a topic he had 
mentioned to McGuffie during his 
time at Rice: What about giving 
bobsledding a try?

Thom knew what a successful 

bobsledder looked like. He crossed 
paths with a few future bobsledders 
during his college years at Nebraska, 
including 
Vancouver 
2010 
gold 

medalist Curt Tomasevicz, who was 
a walk-on football player for the 
Cornhuskers.

In 
Thom’s 
mind, 
McGuffie’s 

skillset resembled that of an Olympic 

bobsledder.

“He just was a very explosive 

athlete, his build is stocky and I 
thought he just looked like he could 
be very successful at it,” Thom said.

McGuffie, listed on the Blue 

Bombers’ 
roster 
at 
5-foot-10, 

200 pounds, mulled over Thom’s 

recommendation 
and 
eventually 

decided to give it a try. His athletic 
gifts had almost always been nearly 
unparalleled. When he was in high 
school, he became known nationally 
for his football recruitment video, 
which 
featured 
him 
hurdling 

defenders. 
The 
video 
accrued 

more than three million views on 
YouTube. The talent displayed in 
the video placed lofty expectations 
on 
McGuffie, 
and 
he 
showed 

glimpses of that ability at Michigan. 
In his lone season as a Wolverine, he 
garnered 486 rushing yards before 
leaving Ann Arbor in a somewhat 
controversial move.

McGuffie continued to show 

his wide array of athletic ability 
at Rice. Though he was primarily 
focused on football, McGuffie ran 
track and field, too. But because of 
the time constraints that football 
and academics imposed, McGuffie 
rarely practiced with the team. 
In 2009, during his year off from 
football because of NCAA transfer 
rules, McGuffie placed in the top 10 
in Conference USA in six different 
events. In his final season at Rice in 
2012, one in which he played football 
and ran track, McGuffie finished 
third in the conference in the 
heptathlon, a combined track and 
field competition made up of seven 
different events.

But still, despite all of his athletic 

acumen, McGuffie was surprised 
by his rapid rise in bobsledding. He 

went from a complete novice to a 
member of Team USA in less than 
three months.

It began in Park City, Utah, 

where McGuffie attended a USA 
bobsledding combine on Aug. 21. 
There, McGuffie was tested in six 
different events: the 15-meter sprint, 
the 30-meter sprint, the 60-meter 
sprint, the 30-meter fly, the broad 
jump and the shot toss. Each of the 
21 male competitors was assigned 
a score from zero to 100 in each 
event based upon his individual 
performance.

McGuffie placed first in five out of 

the six events, finishing the combine 
with a score of 573 out of 600. Ten 
others finished with a score of more 
than 400 points, but nobody came 
close to McGuffie. The second-place 
finisher scored 471.

After 
competing 
in 
the 

USA 
National 
Bobsled 
Push 

Championships 
in 
Lake 
Placid, 

N.Y., it was time to prepare for the 
national team selection race. He 
practiced working as the brakeman, 
the last person to hop into the sled.

As he familiarized himself with 

bobsledding, McGuffie attempted 
to master all of the intricacies of 
the sport. At first glance, McGuffie 
said, 
the 
sport 
seems 
simple. 

Casual viewers think of the movie 
“Cool Runnings,” where a group 
of Jamaicans start bobsledding 
and instantly become stars in the 
sport. Despite McGuffie’s quick rise

in bobsledding, he says the movie 
isn’t rooted in reality. Bobsledding, 
McGuffie says, is violent, just like 
football.

“There’s way more stuff going 

on than just hop in a sled and you 
go,” McGuffie said. “You’ve got to 
make sure the alignment’s perfect 
on every single run. You’ve got to 
do that, every run. Every time you 
go down, you have to have perfect 
riding position. You’ve got to load in 
the sled perfectly, you’ve got to lean 
into the curves, you have to know 
the tracks, you have to have a good 
hit on the sled, which is the initial 
movement off the block. You’ve got 
to hit it good and drive it down the 
track before you jump in.”

McGuffie spent most of his time 

leading up to last week’s event with 
Team USA’s No. 3 sled in Park City, 
but he soon caught the eye of Steve 
Holcomb, the driver of the No. 1 
bobsled. Holcomb has won three 
Olympic medals, so McGuffie didn’t 
hesitate when Holcomb asked him to 
move to his sled.

The move worked out well for 

McGuffie, whose new bobsled team 
finished first in the national team 
selection race, comfortably earning 
him a spot on Team USA. The top 
three sleds in the event earned spots 
on the national team.

Though he admits he still has a 

great deal of room to improve in 
the sport since his career is so new, 
the idea of being able to wear the 
American flag while he competes is 
an appealing one to McGuffie.

“I haven’t competed yet, but 

when you have the USA (emblem), 
I can imagine, it doesn’t matter 
what it is — if it’s 
checkers, or if it’s 
tiddlywinks, you 
put the USA label 
on it, you’re going 
to go hard and 
you’re 
going 
to 

be amped up and 
you’re 
going 
to 

be ready to rock,” 
McGuffie said.

McGuffie 
will 

get 
his 
chance 

soon enough. Starting later this 
month, Team USA will be traveling 
all over Europe to compete. McGuffie 
feels as though he still has a long way 
to go before he secures a spot on the 
2018 Winter Olympic team, but his 
end goal is within sight.

“You’d be dumb to ignore the fact 

that you could be in the Olympics at 
some point in your life if you had the 
opportunity or you had the talent or 
the skillset or the drive to do that,” 
McGuffie said.

McGuffie has always been a 

man of eclectic athletic interests. 

Though he plans to focus only on 
bobsledding for the foreseeable 
future, he does not view the sport 
as his only path to the Olympics.

Rugby sevens, a form of rugby 

played with seven players, will be 
added to the Summer Olympics 
starting in 2016. Team USA officials 

asked McGuffie 
to come out for 
a combine at the 
end of November. 
Bobsledding put 
those plans on 
hold, but rugby 
is something he 
would like to try 
in the future.

There’s always 

track and field, 
too. 
McGuffie 

sometimes wonders what would 
happen if he put all of his time into 
the sport, something he was never 
able to do in college.

“He did the decathlon a little 

bit for us,” Thom, the track coach, 
said. “If he was able to focus on 
it full time, he could have been 
very competitive at the highest 
level at the NCAA level. If you’re 
competitive there, then you can be 
competitive at the international 
level as well.”

Of course, he still thinks about 

Sam McGuffie (left) played one season for Michigan in 2008 but is now on his way to fulfilling his dream of competing in the Olympics.

Breakdown: ‘M’ owns advantage

The Wolverines 
enter Saturday’s 
game as heavy 

favorites 

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

The No. 17 Michigan football 

team plays Rutgers on Saturday 
in a game not expected to be 
close. The Scarlet Knights have 
a 
first-year 
quarterback, 
the 

111th-best defense in the country 
and a coaching staff riddled with 
violations and controversy. Oh, 
and they’ve been outscored, 97-17, 
in their past two games.

The Wolverines, on the other 

hand, seem to have regained 
momentum after a wild win at 
Minnesota, are knocking on the 
door of the Big Ten’s elite and have 
a star in the making in redshirt 
freshman safety Jabrill Peppers.

Here’s how things break down 

for Saturday’s game (spoiler alert: 
It doesn’t look good for Rutgers):

Michigan 
pass 
offense 
vs. 

Rutgers pass defense

The biggest factor in this 

matchup will be who lines up 
under center for the Wolverines. 
Fifth-year 
senior 
quarterback 

Jake Rudock, who has started 
all eight games for Michigan 
this season, left the game in the 
third quarter last week with an 
injury that Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh later referred to as 
soreness in his ribs and back.

Harbaugh said the injury was 

minor, and offensive coordinator 
Tim Drevno said Rudock has been 
practicing all week and should 
“absolutely” 
see 
playing 
time 

Saturday. But until Rudock steps on 
the field, it’s unclear how effective 
Michigan’s passing game can be.

Though 
the 
Wolverines’ 

effectiveness through the air is 
uncertain, it’s painfully clear 
how ineffective Rutgers will be at 
stopping it. The Scarlet Knights 
are 119th in the nation in passing 
yards allowed, 114th in passer 
efficiency allowed and 118th in 
yards per completion allowed. 

Michigan won’t likely rely on 

the passing game to win, but if it 
needs to, Rutgers won’t stop it.

Edge: Michigan

Michigan 
rush 
offense 
vs. 

Rutgers rush defense

Same song, different verse in 

the run game. The Wolverines, 
who may be missing junior 
running backs De’Veon Smith and 
Ty Isaac, have some uncertainty 
at who will pick up the carries, 
yards 
and 
touchdowns, 
but 

Rutgers 
is 
the 
team 
to 
be 

uncertain against.

The Scarlet Knights are holding 

opponents to 155.9 rushing yards 
per game, good for 55th in the 
country, but have allowed 4.7 
yards per carry (92nd) and 20 
touchdowns (111th). That leaves 
plenty 
of 
opportunities 
for 

Michigan to lean on its ground 
game, which — even without a 
fully healthy Smith — can build 
and maintain a lead throughout 
the game.

Edge: Michigan

Rutgers 
pass 
offense 
vs. 

Michigan pass defense

If there’s any way Rutgers can 

stay in contention for an upset, it’s 
through the air. The Wolverines, 
at one point among the top five 
in the nation in every major pass 
defense 
category, 
have 
given 

up 645 yards and countless big 
plays to Michigan State’s Connor 
Cook 
and 
Minnesota’s 
Mitch 

Leidner. What once looked like an 
unbreakable unit has turned into a 
loophole for aspiring offenses.

In addition, Rutgers has done 

most of its damage through the 
passing game. Behind receiver 
Leonte Carroo, who is eighth in 
the country with nine touchdowns 
and 12th with 105.4 yards in just 
five games, the Scarlet Knights 
have shown a knack for making 
explosive plays against even top 
defenses.

Though Rutgers quarterback 

Chris Laviano has done well 
(64.5 
completion 
percentage, 

1,520 yards, 12 touchdowns) in 
his first season as the starter, he 
isn’t Cook or Leidner. While Cook 
and Leidner are experienced, 
conservative 
starters, 
Laviano 

falls into the category of the 
inexperienced 
wild 
cards 

Michigan has faced.

In their dominant five-game 

win streak in September and 
October, the Wolverines faced 
10 quarterbacks — none of whom 
possessed substantial experience 

as a starter — and allowed 60 of 
143 passes to be completed (41.9 
percent) and only one touchdown 
compared to seven interceptions.

Laviano is another first-year 

starter, which should be apparent 
Saturday.

Edge: Michigan

Rutgers 
rush 
offense 
vs. 

Michigan rush defense

Michigan’s run defense will 

have the edge over any rushing 
attack and does so in this matchup. 
The Wolverines are second in 
the nation in yards allowed per 
game (74.6) and per attempt (2.4). 
In addition, Michigan has yet to 
allow a 30-yard run, one of just 
five teams in the nation to do so.

It’s a historically formidable 

front for the Wolverines, while the 
Scarlet Knights’ rushing attack is 
not-so-historically average.

Sophomores 
Josh 
Hicks 

and Robert Martin have near-
identical numbers eight games 
into the season, rushing for four 
touchdowns each on 511 and 501 
yards, respectively.

The two have taken turns 

carrying the load, and seem 
capable of picking up the other’s 
slack.

Regardless, look for both to 

struggle more than usual at the 
hands of Michigan’s defensive 
line.

Edge: Michigan

Special teams

Michigan is first in the nation 

in special teams efficiency, has 
a punter who can boom the ball 
80 yards, a kicker who has yet to 
miss from inside 40 yards and 
two returners (redshirt freshman 
Jabrill Peppers and redshirt junior 
Jehu Chesson) who could take a 
return back for a touchdown in 
any given moment.

Sorry, Rutgers — there isn’t 

much margin for error Saturday. 
Michigan takes special teams 
more seriously than any school 
in the country, and it will show 
Saturday.

Edge: Michigan

Intangibles

The goals for these teams are 

very different. Michigan, at 6-2 
and 3-1 in the Big Ten, is still on 
the hunt for a Big Ten title berth. 
Rutgers is simply looking to avoid 
getting blown out for the third 
game in a row.

When 
Rutgers 
upset 
the 

Wolverines last season, a lot had 
to go their way. Michigan was 
without 
its 
starting 
running 

back at the time (junior Derrick 
Green), it was a home night 
game for the Scarlet Knights and 
Michigan was in the midst of one 
the most tumultuous seasons 
in program history. Even then, 
Rutgers could only sneak out with 
a 26-24 win.

This year, with a thinner 

Rutgers roster, a tougher and 
more stable Michigan team and 
the game being played in the Big 
House, the two programs are in 
entirely different leagues despite 
sharing a division. It will get 
ugly on Saturday, but that will 
be a pretty sight to the eyes of 
Michigan fans.

Edge: Michigan

Michigan

What to Watch For: Peppers, 
quarterback, the ‘carry fairy’

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Last 
season, 
the 
Michigan 

football team was the victim 
of Rutgers’ first-ever Big Ten 
win, when the Scarlet Knights 
topped the Wolverines, 26-24, in 
Piscataway. Rutgers fans stormed 
the field, celebrating a momentous 
victory in school history.

Saturday, the Scarlet Knights 

will take the field at Michigan 
Stadium, looking to pull off an 
even more stunning upset over No. 
17 Michigan.

Here’s 
what 
to 
watch 
for 

when the teams take the field on 
Saturday.

1. Who lines up under center?

A week after redshirt freshman 

Wilton Speight led the Wolverines 
to 
a 
comeback 
win 
over 

Minnesota, there remains a hint of 
uncertainty over fifth-year senior 
Jake Rudock’s status.

Offensive 
coordinator 
Tim 

Drevno said Wednesday that he 
expects Rudock to play, but his 
status will remain at least slightly 
uncertain until he walks onto the 
field for the Wolverines’ first drive. 
Harbaugh likes a little mystery 
leading up to games because it 
forces his opponents to work a 
harder 
while 
game 
planning. 

Rudock’s injury leaves just enough 
doubt that Rutgers will have to at 
least do some cursory preparation 
for Speight.

While Speight’s performance 

last Saturday was enough to 
intrigue fans, it remains clear that 
Rudock is the team’s best option 
at quarterback. Michigan can 
survive his absence but is better 
off with No. 15 in the huddle.

2. How many snaps does 

Jabrill Peppers get on offense?

Speaking 
of 
players 
lining 

up 
at 
quarterback, 
redshirt 

freshman Jabrill Peppers has 
lined up just about everywhere 
for the Wolverines this season. 
Against Minnesota last season, 
Peppers was on the field for more 
than 90 plays, including a few at 
quarterback.

Michigan likely won’t need 

to use Peppers as much against 
Rutgers, but he remains the 
Wolverines’ best big-play threat 
in any phase of the game. Peppers 
has only been on offense the last 
two weeks, so we have yet to see 
how Harbaugh wants to use him 
in games that aren’t close. Unless 
Rutgers has some tricks up its 
sleeve, we could well find out this 
week.

If Peppers continues to get 

touches in a blowout, it might be a 
good indicator that he has secured 
a regular spot in the rotation. 
Conversely, if he sticks to defense 
and special teams, that could 
signal he’s a weapon only to be 
used in case of emergency.

3. Can the secondary return 

to its pre-Michigan State form?

Not only did Michigan lose 

its three-game shutout streak 
against 
the 
Spartans, 
the 

Wolverines’ secondary seemed 
to 
lose 
its 
form, 
too. 
Two 

consecutive 
quarterbacks 
— 

Michigan State’s Connor Cook 
and Minnesota’s Mitch Leidner 
— have thrown for more than 300 
yards against the Wolverines, 
calling into question a secondary 
that once appeared to be among 
the best in the nation.

Rutgers 
quarterback 
Chris 

Laviano isn’t on the level of 
Cook or Leidner, but the Scarlet 
Knights aren’t afraid to throw 
the ball, especially to Leonte 
Carroo, arguably the Big Ten’s 
best receiver. Carroo is battling an 
ankle injury and is questionable 
for Saturday’s game.

If Carroo plays, look for junior 

cornerback Jourdan Lewis to be 
matched up with him. Lewis has 
already broken up 15 passes this 
season, and three more would tie 
him with Marlin Jackson (2002) 
for the school’s single-season 
record.

Breaking up three passes in one 

game is no easy feat, but if Carroo 
plays, it’s possible Lewis could 
get the chance against the Scarlet 
Knights because of the number of 
targets he would face.

4. Who will the carry fairy 

tap?

Redshirt junior running back 

Drake Johnson credited the carry 
fairy on Tuesday for his heavier 
workload 
against 
the 
Golden 

Gophers. Saturday will show if the 
fairy likes repeat success at the 

running back position.

So far this year, junior De’Veon 

Smith has gotten the bulk of 
the carries. But with his health 
slightly uncertain, and Johnson’s 
emergence as a back who can find 
holes and burst through them, it’s 
entirely conceivable that Johnson 
could take hold of the lead job.

Multiple backs will see time 

against the Scarlet Knights, but 
Johnson can grab hold of the race 
with a big game Saturday. Plus, 
this is about the same time of year 
that Johnson took over the lion’s 
share of carries last season before 
tearing 
his 
anterior 
cruciate 

ligament against Ohio State. If he 
is going to replicate his production 
from last November, Rutgers’ less-
than-stellar defense is a great 
team to start against. If the carry 
fairy is agreeable, of course.

AMANDA ALLEN/Daily

Redshirt freshman safety Jabrill Peppers saw significant action on offense last week at Minnesota, but his role is still up in the air going forward.

Behind Enemy Lines: Leonte Carroo

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

If last season’s loss at Rutgers 

was a nightmare for Michigan, it 
was a dream 
come true for 
the 
Scarlet 

Knights. 
Their 
first-

ever Big Ten 
win led fans 
to storm the 
field after the 
game ended.

Now in their second season 

in the conference, the Scarlet 
Knights are struggling to match 
their 2014 output, which was 
charged in large part by a monster 
season 
from 
senior 
receiver 

Leonte Carroo.

Carroo has played in just five of 

Rutgers’ eight games this season 
due to injuries and a suspension 
following an assault charge earlier 
in September. The charge was 
dismissed by a municipal judge in 
October.

In his five games, Carroo 

has totaled 527 yards and nine 
touchdowns 
for 
the 
Scarlet 

Knights.

The Daily spoke with Carroo at 

Big Ten Media Days in July to talk 
about last year’s game, adjusting 
to the Big Ten 
and rap feuds.

The 

Michigan 
Daily: In your 
first season in 
the Big Ten last 
year, 
to 
beat 

Michigan 
at 

home, that must 
have 
been 
a 

crazy “Welcome 
to the Big Ten” 
moment.

Leonte 
Carroo: 
It 
was 

definitely crazy. It was fun. After 
Kemoko Turay blocked that field 
goal, me and (former quarterback 
Gary Nova) hugged each other 
and almost cried, and it was just 
a great feeling to beat one of the 
most storied programs in college 
football history at home. It was 
the best feeling ever.

TMD: Did it set in immediately, 

or did it take a minute?

LC: It set in immediately. As 

soon as I heard that, “dun-dun,” 
after the field goal was blocked, 
you know the thump from the ball 

hitting his hand, it was just like, 
‘Wow, we really beat Michigan.’ 
We always had the confidence 

going into the 
week that we 
were 
going 

to beat them, 
but 
after 
it 

happened, 
you’re just kind 
of like, ‘Wow.’

It 
was 
just 

very 
exciting, 

and you couldn’t 
wait to storm 
the field. And 

I took about 100 photos after 
the game with fans on the field. 
Just taking pictures and signing 
autographs and hugging, found 
my parents and hugged them. It 
was just great.

TMD: Was it hard to transition 

to the Big Ten? I 
know there are 
some 
stylistic 

differences.

LC: 
It 
was 

a little bit of 
(a 
difficult 

transition). 
Other 
than 

that, we were fine. The Big Ten 

is a very competitive league, you 
know. You’ve got to go out there, 
bring your all, give it your ‘A’ game 
every single rep. There’s very 
little margin for error. You’ve got 
to kind of be disciplined and play 
hard, and if you don’t, you’re going 
to end up losing.

TMD: What are some of the 

things you learned from last 
year that you’ll be better now for 
learning?

LC: That we knew what to 

expect. Last year we got our feet 
wet, but now we know what the 
Big Ten Conference is about. And 
we want teams to know that we’re 
not the stepping stone in the Big 
Ten. We’re going to come out and 
we’re going to play our hardest, 
and we’re going to compete and 
we’re going to punch people in the 
mouth. So, they better be ready to 

play Rutgers.

TMD: 
I 

noticed 
you’re 

wearing a rose 
pin. Is that a 
nod 
to 
your 

aspirations this 
season?

LC: Yeah, I 

wear this rose because I want to 

go to the Rose Bowl.

TMD: What’s the thing about 

this year’s team that people will 
be surprised to see?

LC: The way we love each other. 

This team is way closer than any 
other team we ever had in the 
past. You’ve got guys that just will 
die for each other, and this is the 
tightest team we’ve ever had. It 
will show on the field.

TMD: 
Which 
of 
your 

teammates has the strangest game 
day habits?

LC: I have to go with probably 

Darius (Hamilton). I know you 
guys have been hearing about 
it all day, but he listens to One 
Direction and Justin Bieber and 
stuff like that before games.

TMD: Do you judge a guy for 

his musical taste?

LC: No, not at all! If that’s 

what motivates him and gets him 
pumped before the game...

Darius Hamilton (cutting in): 

I’m getting so much One Direction 
love on Twitter right now.

TMD: (Laughs) What’s your 

pregame music, then?

LC: I listen to Drake. That’s 

what motivates me and gets me 
going.

“Now we know 

what the Big 

Ten Conference 

is about.”

“It was the best 

feeling ever.”

football, too. McGuffie still loves 
the sport he played for 15 years, 
and he won’t rule out a return.

Sometimes, he thinks back to 

his time at Michigan. He holds 
great respect for his running 
backs 
coach, 

Fred 
Jackson, 

and he says he 
“loves” 
former 

Michigan coach 
Rich Rodriguez, 
even 
though 

McGuffie 
was 

not pleased with 
how 
his 
time 

as a Wolverine 
ended. 
McGuffie, 
all 

of these years later, says the main 
reason for his transfer was to be 
closer to his family in Texas. At 
the time, Rodriguez placed much 
of the blame on McGuffie having 
a concussion problem, something 
McGuffie says was not a factor.

McGuffie 
still 
roots 
for 

Michigan, 
saying 
he 
loves 

everything 
about 
the 
school. 

Things just didn’t work out back 
then. He didn’t feel like the 
Wolverines’ spread offense was the 
right fit, and he was just a young kid 
tasked with replacing Mike Hart. 
He faced enormous expectations 
due in large part to one recruiting 
video.

He didn’t lose that talent when 

he left. It just took him a while to 

discover the best 
way to use it, and 
with more than 
two years until 
the 2018 Winter 
Olympics, maybe 
he still hasn’t.

But now, in 

his next career, 
McGuffie has the 
chance to fulfill 
a 
childhood 

fantasy. He never 

thought he would be a bobsledder, 
never thought he would make the 
Olympics in this way. But he wants 
to find out what could happen if he 
tries. 

“I don’t want to be the what-if 

guy. I kind of want to see what I’m 
capable of,” McGuffie said. “I want 
to see how far I can go, what I can 
do.”
