for effcts of tax increase

67 percent of
respondents would
welcome option
By CHELSEY DAMBRO
For the Daily
Results of a survey recently
sent out to students to gauge their
views on gender-neutral housing
were released this week and show
that a majority of students support
the initiative.
The Gender Neutral Housing
Coalition - a committee formed
by student representatives of the
Residence Hall Association, the
Michigan Student Assembly and
other campus organizations - sent
out the survey to students living
in University Housing on March
17. The survey ran for a week and
ended on March 24.
Of the 9,545 students who
received the survey, 19 percent
responded. Out of the students
that responded, 38 percent said
they would select gender-neutral
housing as an*option. And while
67 percent responded that gender-
neutral housing would be a wel-
come option for the University
Housing community, 19 percent
disagreed. Out of the 1,785 respon-
dents, 91 percent said they identify
as heterosexual.
The survey asked other ques-

tions like how likely students
would be to return to University
Housing if gender-neutral options
were available. Of the students
who responded, 34 percent said
they would consider returning if
the option was available, while 52
percent said they remained indif-
ferent.
The survey also asked whether
students would choose a same-
gender roommate or a roommate
of a different gender. The major-
ity of students - 60 percent - said
they would choose a same-gender
roommate, while 15 percent said
they would choose a roommate of
a different gender.
Renagh O'Leary, chair of the
University's undergraduate chap-
ter of the American Civil Liberties
Union - which was involved in
the push for gender-neutral hous-
ing - said the results of the survey
match her expectations.
Gender-neutral housing advo-
cates created the survey knowing
that they would receive strong stu-
dent support, she said.
"I am optimistic about making
progress even before the school
year ends'to implement gender-
neutral housing more fully," she
said.
Gender-neutral housing has
been a much-discussed issue on
campus this year, and was a focus

Congress passed
10-percent increase
in tanning tax in
* health care bill
By NATALIE BERKUS
Daily StaffReporter
Amidst heated debate sur-
rounding health care reform,
health concerns about indoor
tanning have pushed legislators

to disincentivize the practice for
consumers nationwide - and
students and Ann Arbor tanning
salons are bracing for the effects
of the 10-percent tax increase.
The increase in the tanning
tax, which was passed as part of
the recent health care bill and
will take effect in July, reflects an
effort spearheaded by legislators
to discourage people from using
indoor tanning booths in light of
growing concerns that they cause
significant health problems.
Marianne Udow-Phillips,

director of the University's Center
for Healthcare Research & Trans-
formation, said that though tan-
ning salons are concerned about
the tax, she believes it will only
have a minimal effect on their
businesses.
"I just can't imagine that a
10-percent tax will make a dif-
ference in terms of the business,"
Udow-Phillips said.
Udow-Phillips added that the
tanning industry was likely tar-
geted for the tax because its lob-
bying forces are not as aggressive

as those in the cosmetics industry
that back procedures like Botox or
plastic surgery.
"I think (the government) had
a broader idea of taxing cosmetic
services previously, and frankly
the rest of the cosmetic indus-
try was better organized and got
most of it out of the bill," Udow-
Phillips said. "The tanning indus-
try was not as well organized and
didn't have as good of lobbyists."
Though Udow-Phillips said the
tax won't affect tanning salons,

ARGO DAM
After months of debate, state
officials say dam can remain

State agency says

embankment for
I dam to stay open
By ALEX KIRSHENBAUM
Daily StaffReporter
Crews began clearing the Argo
Dam embankment yesterday,
after months of deliberation over
the dam's fate.
Last week, City of Ann Arbor
officials were given the go-ahead
from the Michigan Department

of Natural Resources and Envi-
ronment to keep the dam, which
allows for the creation of Argo
Pond, as long as the embank-
ment is cleared of trees and their
roots.
Controversy over the fate of the
dam began last August when the
Michigan Department of Envi-
ronmental Quality - now known
as the Michigan Department of
Natural Resources and Environ-
ment - wrote to City Administra-
tor Roger Fraser asking that the
dam be repaired or removed.
In response, the city hired a
consulting firm to evaluate the
status of the dam., The results

of the evaluation, which were
sent to MDNRE earlier this year,
found that the dam was "safe and
did not need repairs."
Though MDNRE is allowing
the city to keep the dam, accord-
ing to a March 24 press release,
the department doesn't complete-
ly agree with the firm's findings.
Accordingto the release, MDNRE
officials are still concerned about
the structural integrity of the
dam. The release also stated that
maintenance was still necessary
to keep the dam in place.
The required clean up began
yesterday, consists, for now, of the

Housing officials
say smell caused

* ByVANESSA NUNEZ
Daily StaffReporter
Students hitting the tennis
courts near Palmer Field this
weekend may be taking in more

than just the rays and the fresh
air - they could also be breath-
ing in a foul odor wafting across
the Hill.
Officials from University
Housing and the University's
Department of Occupational
Safety and Environmental Health
opened up the access point to an
underground filtration tank -
from where the officials say the
unpleasant smell is emanating -
on the Hill on Monday.
University Housing spokes-

interceptor where waste, water
and grease - from the dishwash-
ing machine and garbage disposal
inside the Hill Dining Center
- can flow through and sepa-
rate out food particulates from
the grease before it reaches Ann
Arbor's sanitary sewer system.
Though the tank is separating

Washtenaw County
street soccer team
aims to help local
homeless population
By RACHEL BRUSSTAR
Daily StaffReporter
Every week, a group of Washt-
enaw County residents and local
homeless people gather at Wide-
world Sports Center in Ann Arbor

for a fun and friendly game of soc-
cer.
The weekly games are part of
a program founded by Washt-
enaw County residents Sara Sil-
vennoinen, Linda Bacigalupi and
Jim Bastian in 2007, called the
Street Soccer Project Team. Bet-
ter known as SSPORT, the team
- comprised of residents of vari-
ous cities in the county and some
University students - aims to use
soccer and community building
to help the homeless participants
change their life situations.

For Ann Arbor resident Silven-
noinen, who has been playing soc-
cer her entire life, the organization
combines her twobiggest passions:
soccer and community outreach.
"Despite the struggles of work-
ing with people when they are
probably in their worst situations,
it is so rewarding to see where they
were compared to where they are
now and the progress that people
can make in their daily lives," Sil-
vennoinen said.

New state law will
allow cheaper park
fees for motorists
Gov. Jennifer Granholm has
signed into a law a plan allowing
Michigan motorists to visit state
parks by paying a $10 fee when
they renew their vehicle license
plates each year.
Voluntarily paying the fee
would exempt state residents
from having to buy $6 daily or $24
annual passes to enter state parks
and have access to recreation
areas, forests and boat ramps.
The system takes effect Oct. 1.
Granholm signed the bill Wednes-
day.
Those choosing not to pay the
$10 can select an option on the
vehicle registration form to not
use the state parks system.
Out-of-state visitors still must
buy daily or annual passes for
Michigan parks.
Park officials hope the new fee
will raise more money for park
upkeep and operations.

Earlier this week, McHugh had

who admitted they were gay in

Russian pres. tells
police to be tougher
to fight terrorism
President Dmitry Medvedev
made a surprise visit yesterday
to the violence-wracked south-
ern province of Dagestan, telling
police and security forces to use
tougher, "more cruel" measures
to fight the "scum" responsible
for terrorist attacks.
Russia's security chief said
some terror suspects had been
detained.
Twin suicide bombings in Mos-
cow - which Islamic militants
from the North Caucasus claim to
have carried out - have refocused
attention on the violence that
for years has been confined to
Russia's predominantly Muslim
regions. The rush-hour attacks
Monday on the Moscow subway
killed 39 people and left nearly 90
hospitalized.
On Wednesday, two suicide
bombings in Dagestan killed 12

people, including nine policemen,
a frequent target of attacks in part
because they represent Russian
authority.
Another explosion Thursday
killed two suspected militants
and wounded a third in Dagestan
near the border with Chechnya.
Police said the men may have
been transporting a makeshift
bomb.

FRAMINGHAM, Mass. (AP)
- Detouring from his schedule,
President Barack Obama yesterday
thanked emergency workers strug-
gling against disastrous flooding in
the Northeast.
"When these kind of natural
disasters hit, what matters are the
people on the ground," Obama told
crews at the Massachusetts Emer-
gency Management Agency head-
quarters some 20 miles west of
Boston.
Joined by Massachusetts Gov.
Deval Patrick, Obama met with
state and local emergency opera-
tions officials who are monitoring
floods throughout the state.
The president thanked the work-
ers on behalf of all Americans for
their thorough response to the
floods. He did not visit any flood-hit
areas in hisbrief detour.
Record rainfalls have caused
flooding across the New England
states, with Rhode Island taking
the most devastating toll. Bridges

and highways have washed out
from Maine to Connecticut and
sewage systems have been over-
whelmed to the point that families
were asked to stop flushing toilets.
National Guard troops were
deployed in Rhode Island, Massa-
chusetts and Connecticut. Home-
land Security Secretary Janet
Napolitano and FEMA Deputy
Administrator Rich Serino planned
to travel to Rhode Island on Friday
to assess the damage.
Obama made'his unannounced
stop after rallying in Maine for his
new health care law. He then dart-
ed to a pair of evening fundraisers
in Boston for fellow Democrats.
Flooded tracks in Rhode Island
prompted Amtrak to suspend some
services in the Northeast for the
second consecutive day. The major
route between East Coast cities
opened late yesterday afternoon.
The rains stopped Wednes-
day and the floodwaters began to
recede in hard-hit Rhode Island,
though flooding could persist for
several days and permanently close
businesses alreadystrugglingin the
weak economy.
The flooding capped rainfall
records across the region.

Mine tragedy is the
second to occur in
China this week
BEIJING (AP) - A gas explo-
sion at a mine in central China
killed 12 workers and trapped
32 underground, state media
said yesterday, the second major
mine disaster in the country this
week.
Fifty miners were able to
escape after the Wednesday eve-
ning blast, which was caused by
an underground gas leak, the Xin-
hua News Agency said, citing in
Henan province's governor, Guo
Gengmao. It'spossiblethe trapped
miners survived the explosion, he
was cited as saying.
About 100 rescue workers were

trying to reached the trapped
workers at the privately owned
Guomin Mining Co. coal pit in
Yichuan County of Luoyang City,
Xinhua said. The mine had been
under renovation.
Mine boss Wang Guozheng
has disappeared and authorities
ordered his assets frozen in the
wake of the accident, Xinhua said.
Yichuan County Chief Wu Ligang
and three other county officials
were fired.
News of the explosion came as
rescue work continued at a mine
in northern China's Shanxi prov-
ince, four days after 153 workers
were trapped underground when
water flooded the shaft where
they were working.
The flood at the Wangjialing
mine started when workers dig-
ging tunnels broke through into

an old shaft filled with water,
a government safety body said,
accusingmine officials of ignoring
safety rules and danger warnings
in a rush to open the mine.
There has been no contact with
the trapped miners, but authori-
ties held out hope that some could
be alive.
China's coal mines are the
world's deadliest, despite a
multiyear government effort to
reduce fatalities. Most accidents
are blamed on failure to follow
safety rules or lack of required
ventilation, fire-control and
equipment.
Accidents killed 2,631 coal min-
ers in China last year, down from
6,995 deaths in 2002, the most
dangerous year on record, accord-
ing to the State Administration of
Coal Mine Safety.

Citizens of Guinea-
Bissau show support
for detained leader
BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau (AP) -
Mutinous soldiers seized the head
of Guinea-Bissau's armed forces
yesterday and placed the country's
prime minister under house arrest
in an apparent coup attempt in the
tiny coup-plagued African nation
where the president was assassi-
nated last year.
A crowd of hundreds gathered
outside Prime Minister Carlos
Gomes Jr.'s office in the capital in
a show of support for the detained
leader as martial music played on
the radio, code for a military-led
coup in this part of the world.
Soldiers surrounded the prime
minister's office at around 8 a.m.
yesterday, said his press attache
Mamodou Djau, who arrived
shortly after the soldiers made
off with Gomes and a member of
his Cabinet. Djau said the pre-
mier was taken to a military camp,
before being driven back to his
residence where he appeared to be
under house arrest.
"We don't know what is going
on. We are all asking the same
question," said Djau, who was
reached on his cell phone. He said
he had not been able to speak to
the prime minister since the inci-
dent.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-
moon "is following with concern
the military incidents in Guinea-
Bissau involvingthe detention and
subsequent release of the prime
minister," U.N. associate spokes-
man Farhan Haq said in a state-
ment.

"He calls on the military and
political leadership of Guinea-
Bissau to resolve differences by
peaceful means and to maintain
constitutional order and ensure
respect for the rule of law," Haq
said.
Immediately after the prime
minister was seized, hundreds of
people descended into the street
in a show of support for the demo-
cratically elected leader whose
party controls 67 of the parlia-
ment's 100 seats. The crowd gath-
ered first around Gomes' office
and later around his private resi-
dence.
At the military camp, the head
of the armed forces Zamora Indu-
ta remained under guard, while
his No. 2 appeared to be in control.
Antonio Ndjai, the detained
army chief's deputy, called a
news conference soon after
Gomes was released and issued
a chilling warning: "If the people
continue to go out into the streets
to show their support for Carlos
Gomes Jr., then I will kill Carlos
Gomes Jr. Or Iwill send someone
to kill him," he said, according to
the interview broadcast on state
TV.
Earlier in the day, soldiers had
gone to the United Nations com-
pound in the capital, where a
senior army leader accused of a
previous coup attempt had been
in hiding for the past 95 days. A
foreign diplomat who asked not
to be named because he was not
authorized to speak to the press
said that Admiral Bubo Na Tchuto
left the U.N. compound with the
soldiers.
He appeared to be acting as
second-in-command of the muti-
nous soldiers and he told reporters

gathered at the news conference:
"I spent 95 days inside the U.N.
compound. Why didn't the popu-
lation take to the streets then?
Why are they takingto the streets
now for Gomes?" Na Tchuto asked.
"I spent 11 years fighting for
Guinea-Bissau's independence.
Gomes did not take part in that
fight," he said. "If the popula-
tion continues to go out into the
streets, I will send the military to
clean the streets," he said.
Na Tchuto was himself placed
under house arrest in 2008 after
being accused of plotting a coup.
He escaped his captors and fled
abroad. He disguised himself as a
fisherman and returned in a dug-
out canoe and immediately sought
refuge inside the U.N. compound.
Since independence from Por-
tugal in 1974, the West African
nation has been beset by coups,
military revolts and political
assassinations. The lawlessness
has in recent years attracted
South American drugs traffickers,
who have used the country as a
transit point for shipping cocaine
to Europe.
The country's last president
who had ruled for nearly a quar-
ter-century was assassinated on
March 2, 2009 hours after the
head of the army was killed in a
bomb explosion. Elections were
held three months after the twin
assassinations and Gomes' party
came to power.
Experts applauded the elec-
tions which appeared to be free
and fair, but cautioned that the
country needed to find a way to
contain the military, which has
long controlled the country from
behind the scenes.

With new rules, consumers to pay
more for cars, trucks, less at pumps

New standards to
increase mileage by
10 mpg in six years
WASHINGTON (AP) - Driv-
ers will have to pay more for cars
and trucks, but they'll save at the
pump under tough new federal
rules aimed at boosting mileage,
cutting emissions and hastening
the next generation of fuel-stingy
hybrids and electric cars.
The new standards, announced
Thursday, call for a 35.5 miles-
per-gallon average within six
years, up nearly 10 mpg from now.
By setting national standards
for fuel efficiency and greenhouse
gas emissions from tailpipes, the
government hopes to squeeze out
more miles per gallon whether
you buy atiny Smart fortwo micro

car, a rugged Dodge Ram pickup
truck or somethinginbetween.
Theruleswillcostconsumers an
estimated $434 extra per vehicle in
the 2012 model year and $926 per
vehicle by 2016, the government
said. But the heads of the Trans-
portation Department and Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency said
car owners would save more than
$3,000 over the lives of their vehi-
cles through better gas mileage.
Touting the plan, Transporta-
tion Secretary Ray LaHood said,
"Putting more fuel-efficient cars
on the road isn't just the right
thing to do for our environment,
it's also a great way for Americans
to save a lot of money at the pump."
The requirements for the
2012-2016 model years pleased
environmentalists who have criti-
cized sluggish efforts by previous
administrations to boost fuel effi-

ciency. They also were welcomed
by automakers who have been
seeking a single standard after
California and a dozen states tried
to create their own rules.
Dave McCurdy, a former Okla-
homa congressman who leads the
Alliance of Automobile Manufac-
turers, a trade group representing
11 automakers, said the industry
supported the single national
standard for future vehicles. He
said the program made "sense for
consumers, for government poli-
cymakers and for automakers."
Not all dealers were pleased.
Ed Tonkin, a Portland, Ore., car
dealer who chairs the National
Automobile Dealers Association,
said the rules were the "most
expensive fuel economy mandates
in history" and would turn many
new cars and trucks into luxury
items for consumers.

Elemental energy
Michigan should invest in wind turbine production
There's change in the air. The winds over Lake Mich-
igan are just right for generating clean electricity.
Last month, Scandia Wind Offshore, a Norway-based
wind energy company, proposed a $4 billion wind turbine
development project in Michigan that would prevent an esti-
mated 2 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions and create
about 3,000 jobs. If these appealing proposals are accepted,
they could lead to more clean energy efforts in the state. To
make Michigan a state powered by green energy, the leg-
islature must commit to policies that support the develop-
ment of alternative energy sources like wind turbines.

Selling yourself

Scandia's proposal calls for offshore tur-
bines in Lake Michigan that would generate
a combined 1,000 megawatts of electricity.
That's in addition to the 150 megawatts of
turbine-turning potential the company
proposes to utilize on land in West Michi-
gan. Their proposal came only shortly
before the first public meeting last week
of the Michigan Great Lakes Wind Coun-
cil, a body created by Gov. Jennifer Gran-
holm to suggest legislation for encouraging
wind power development. On Tuesday,
Ventower Industries, a supplier of materi-
als to build wind turbines, broke ground on
a 115,000-square-foot wind turbine tower
construction facility in Monroe, which is
expected to employ 150 people.
Encouraging renewable energy and clean
technology has serious implications for the
creation of jobs and the recovery of Michi-
gan's economy. Wind turbine construction
companies should be able to build in close
proximity to the lakes where the turbines
will be assembled and used. To attract wind
power companies to build in Michigan and
create jobs and revenue, the state should
provide smart, detailed laws that encour-
age these green energy companies. Those
types of laws are what Michigan lacks.
It's up to the Michigan legislature to
enact policies encouraging wind power. But
a bill currently under consideration would
place a moratorium on offshore wind devel-

opment like the kind that Scandia has pro-
posed. That bill is almost comically at odds
with logical public policy that would ben-
efit the state's environment and economy.
And while Michigan legislators contem-
plate shutting down this promising indus-
try, Ontario is considering an $85 billion
project that is predicted to create 66,000
jobs. Michigan's comparatively lethargic
response to promoting wind power makes
it easy to guess where developers will build
the next new turbine factory.
Economic benefits aside, the lasting leg-
acy of inaction would be environmental.
Supporting renewable energy is a matter
of social responsibility. Though burning
coal, which is currently Michigan's prima-
ry energy source, seems cheap and easy, it
comes with a heavy price. Coal emits signif-
icant amounts of carbon dioxide as it burns,
contributing to global warming. To combat
the negative effects of climate change, peo-
ple must change their behavior and switch
to more environmentally-friendly energy
options. Unlike coal, wind energy is a clean,
efficient and renewable resource.
Encouraging green energy isn't just tilting
at windmills. Fighting this battle for clean
energy could have lasting consequences for
the state. The state government has a duty to
act in the best interest of its constituents and
pass legislation to encourage the growth of
green energy sources like wind power.

ut of the many, many e-mails
I receive about my columns,
an overwhelming number
go something like
this: "Hey pleas
[sic] tell me how to
get hired to right
[sic] for the Daily?!
LOL." And out of
the many, many
conversations I
hear around cam-
pus, an increasing-
number go some-
thing like this: WILL
"And now Stepha- GRUNDLER
nie has an intern-
ship, I'm going
c-r-a-z-y. Yeah,
she's the fat one. Hey, do you think
that guy is following us?"
Jobs: everyone wants them, and
summer is right around the corner.
Today's topic is how to go out and
GET them, as a student in today's
economy, without getting on your
knees and begging. Instead, try get-
ting on all fours and begging.
No, I'm kidding, it's still possible
to get a job. You just have to think
a little old-fashionably, by which I
mean you have to think like your par-
ents. Whenever I'm having a tough
time getting an employer to hire me,
I just remember my father's advice:
"Look, just go and talk to the guy,
dammit." Or something like that, I
don't remember exactly. I think this
was how most jobs were acquired by
our parents' generation, which might
explain the current economic crisis.
Nowadays, what most students fail to
realize is that employers aren't just
looking for a snappy resum, flawless
GPA and attractive physical features
- they're also looking for interper-
sonal skills and initiative. Some-

times, just showing up, being polite
and casually mentioning, "Oh hey,
I'm the new intern" does the trick.
Of course, this can backfire. I
vividly remember walking into The
Michigan Daily office a few semes-
ters ago - the spackle on the wall
was light brown - and asking with
a smile if they needed any writers. I
was hired on the spot and to this day
I earn a measly $5.82 per column. So
always make sure that you want to
work at a place that might hire you
immediately, because it's awkward to
decline an offer in person.
But there will be some job oppor-
tunities in which you can't use your
personal charm. There will be some
jobs in which the only communica-
tion between you and the employer
will be by e-mail, or, God forbid, car-
rier pigeon. And by far the most com-
mon mistake made by students when
writing to employers is not being able
to write.
.This is to be expected at a large
research university that's trapped
in a culture of ignorance and whose
society is misinformed by an anthro-
pocentric view of the universe. On
the other hand, you don't want to
write too wordily. Like most things in
life, there is a fine balance in writing
to prospective employers. For exam-
ple, a common approach that is all too
bare goes something like this:
"Yo, I saw the position for (such
and such) on your website. I go to the
University of Michigan. When can we
meet?"
Just because you go to the Univer-
sity of Michigan doesn't mean you
will be automatically hired, especial-
ly now that we have a losing football
team. You've got to sell yourself in an
e-mail, not your school. But don't sell
yourself too much, as in this approach:

"Why do I want to work at Sum-
mer Fun Summer Camps? Ever since
I spent my childhood beside the spar-
kling waters of Big Bone Lake I've
realized that I like to spend my time
outdoors, in the sumner, preferably
around lakes. It is nice and warm in
the summer and there are fish to catch.
One time, when I was fishing with my
dad, he said, "Pass the beer, son," and I
accidentally dropped the beer into the
lake and we had a good laugh. Then he
stopped laughing and said, "Go get it"
and that's when I learned to swim. I
have so many good memories like that!
I want to help the children at Summer
Fun Summer Camps and give them a
summer to remember."

Employers don't
want to hear your
whole life story.
It's nicely written, right? But it's
just a bit too personal, and you don't
want to make your employer uncom-
fortable. The balance between writ-
ing too little and writing too much is
a delicate one, and can only be real-
ized with practice.
So to all of those students who are
looking for a job, I wish you the best
of luck. The search may be strenu-
ous. The search may be difficult.
But just remember: there are always
spring/summer classes. Unless you
really need a job and money. Then my
advice is: Don't write columns.

'U' smoking, ban, federal
health care bill limit choice
TO THE DAILY:
Alex Biles should be commended for his
most recent column (Dear President Coleman...,
03/23/2010). The extreme (at least for now) mea-
sures he predicts represent a logical progression
from the precedent set by the president of our
university.
These measures also bring into question the
health care reform bill passed earlier this week.
For just as University President Mary Sue Cole-
man is watching out for our health, so is Presi-
dent Barack Obama. By mandating that every
individual purchase health insurance, Obama is
promoting a culture of health through a guaran-
tee of medical access. However, to fund this goal,
the burden of payment for one individual will be
thrust upon others. Considering economics and
the state of obesity in America, one might pos-
tulate future government mandates that mirror
those proposed by Biles.
This may all sound extreme and Orwellian.
But these are rational extensions of the actions
taken by our leaders. No matter what side you
take in the health care or smoking ban debate,
there can be no argument on whether the previ-
ously mentioned scenarios fall in line with cur-
rent policy changes.
Frankly, I find each leader's position fright-
ening - and hypocritical. On one hand, Obama
calls America the greatest nation in the world
and Coleman frequently extols our student
body as 'the Leaders and Best'. But it is also
clear that neither believes we are intelligent
enough as individuals to make choices that
affect our own future.

Living Arts offers students
a community to learn, grow

SEND LETTERS TO: TOTHEDAILY@UMICH.EDU
resented Living Arts, the new living/learning
community to be housed in Bursley Hall on
North Campus starting in Fall 2010 (Corralling
creativity will only stigmatize, 03/18/2010).
Approximately 40 percent of all first-year
students are housed in Bursley Hall or the Vera
Baits Houses. Despite the large number of first-
year students living on North Campus, all of
the living/learning communities for first-year
students are currently located on Central Cam-
pus. Living Arts, which will house 80 students
in two hallways in Bursley for its pilot year, will
fill this void.
Living Arts is a living/learning community
primarily for first- and second-year students
that seeks to enhance North Campus's already
vibrant resources and to make students excit-
ed about living and studying on North Cam-
pus. Students who participate in Living Arts
will take a one-credit class each semester that
explores the creative process and collaboration
across engineering, the arts, and other fields.
Like all living/learning communities, Living
Arts is open to all University undergraduates.
Living Arts will enhance Bursley and the
North Campus community by providing a gal-
lery for students to display their artwork. New
in-house studios designed to foster students'
creative and collaborative work in art and
design, architecture, and engineering. A new
performance space with a sprung floor, as well
as group and individual practice rooms, will
be available for musicians, dancers and actors.
The renovated spaces will be open to all Bursley
residents and much of the programming initi-
ated by Living Arts faculty, staff and residents
will be open to all interested students, wherever
they live and whatever their academic program.
In addition to establishing Living Arts, Arts
on Earth is working with colleagues across cam-
pus to infuse creativity and the arts throughout
the University. We encourage Block and other
students to visit our website to learn more about
our own programming (artsonearth.umich.
edu) and to visit Montage (montage.umich.edu),
the University's new online arts portal, to learn
about colleagues' work in engaging students in
the arts and creativity across campus.

Money matters

Back in September, I wrote
a column about my inabil-
ity to choose a major and
proud acceptance
of my indecision
(Majorly undecid-
ed, 09/24/2010).
So as I sit here
six months later
and presumably
six months wiser,
I would like to
update you on
my progress - or LEAH
rather lack thereof.
Now, not only have POTI
I failed to declare
a major (though I
have a few in mind), but I also have no
direction in which to gear my sum-
mer job search. I am now not only
majorly undecided, but also majorly
screwed - so much for asserting my
uncertainty with pride.
Don't get me wrong: I am by no
means worried about declaring a
major (I promise, it will happen even-
tually). But what's an undecided girl
to do when in search of what should
be meaningful summer employment?
Long gone are the carefree summer
days filled with boardwalk fries,
waitressing shifts at the local diner
and pool-side lounging - here to stay
are the prestigious internships with.
40-hour-plus work weeks intended to
serve as stepping stones to full-time
employment after graduation. But I
wonder how often these internships
turn into real jobs and how often the
endless time put in is actually time
well spent. With this in mind, I urge
students to consider all the pros and
cons of summer jobs and internships
before committing to watching their
summer go by from the confinement
of an office cubicle for little or no pay.
I'll admit that for students with
a clear direction, attractive intern-
ships might be a good route, as they

could lead to potential employment in
a desired field - well, lucky for them.
But undecided students like me,
and any other wandering souls out
there, should consider other summer
employment options before search-
ing long and hard for an unpaid and
potentially boring internship in a
field we may never pursue.
I feel incredible pressure from
my peers to do something with my
summer that's a bit more mentally
stimulating than dog-walking or
babysitting, but I also feel incredible
pressure from my parents to do some-
thing compensable with my time.
Many internships might seem attrac-
tive for resume building, but do these
benefits really outweigh the lure of
cold hard cash? I think not.
When I think of how my parents
and grandparents spent their sum-
mers - taking a well-deserved break
from academics while earning spend-
ing money and still having time to
enjoy chocolate-dipped Carvel cones
on the boardwalk - I can't help but
long for a similar summer experience.
Sure, they worked, but they didn't
necessarily work the way many of us
overachieving Wolverines do. Many
students pursue a detailed four-year
plan, with perfect summer intern-
ships putting the cherry on top of their
already perfect resumes. Gag me. Yes,
admittedly I'm a bit jealous of these
students, but I think I resent them
more than I envy them. Why should
I feel guilty for wanting to spend my
last few chances to enjoy summer
doing something I actually do enjoy?
The answer my friends - I shouldn't.
But what I, and everyone else,
should do is get creative. IfI can't get
my act together enough to choose a
major or find an internship that could
help secure me a job in my chosen
field, I might as well do something
that admittedly may not drop jaws
nor raise eyebrows, will put money in

my pocket and maybe.even be enjoy-
able. It's certainly hard to compete in
the current economic environment
where even people with advanced
degrees are working entry-level jobs.
And the sad truth is that if you don't
have a connection somewhere, there
are likely dozens of other college stu-
dents who do.

0

You don't have to
have an internship'
this summer.
So what better things do young
minds have to offer than fresh; new
ideas? Some success stories I've
heard include family van turned ice-
cream truck and law student turned
doorman. Neither job seems espe-
cially desirable for the well-educated
young adult, but what have we got to
lose? Students should remember this
while spending hours on job search
websites seeking the perfect job to
embellish their resume.
Upperclassmen might look down
on my naivety, but even for those
of you about to enter the real work
world, I still believe there is a balance
to be found between kowtowing to an
unappreciative summer boss for no
money in hopes of future employment
and enjoyment of summer's diver-
sions with a couple of spare dollars
in your pocket. So come September,
I may still be majorly undecided, but
I most certainly will not be majorly
screwed. Looks like once again I'll be
asserting my uncertainty with pride
(in the form of dollar bills).

'Food, 'glorious Food'

Jamie Oliver tries to
revolutionize the way
America eats
By ANT MITCHELL
Daily Arts Writer
Jamie Oliver gets emotional
about obesity in America in his new
show, "Jamie
Oliver's Food
Revolution"
- like, really .
emotional. all e Oliver's
Then, America Food
gets defensive Revolution
about being fat.
The result? An Fridays at 9 p.m.
hour's worth of ABC
somewhat dis-
turbing, very
frustrating, yet well intentioned
reality television. Reshaping an
American town's eating habits can
be far more entertaining than sim-
ply watching a bunch of parents and
kids diet.
It's probably prudent to just come
out and say it: Jamie Oliver ("Jamie
at Home"), while a sincere man who
is genuinely concerned with the
state of health in America, is kind
of nuts. Impassioned in the face of
heart disease and diabetes, he flips
out when confronted with the "Alad-
din's cave of processed crap" (a.k.a.,
the freezer of an elementary school)

and angrily bitches at the kids when
they throw out their healthy food
in exchange for pizza. "You didn't
want your kiwi, didn't like your
fruit, didn't like your bread roll" he
rants, aggressively bangingthe trays
of food into the trash while the chil-
dren look at him like he's crazy. A
superhero of such intense and righ-
teous anger, he's comparable to Mor-
gan Spurlock from "Super Size Me"
when he threatens to smack his kids
every time they see a McDonald's.
While it's true that he does get a
bit extreme - telling a woman she
was killing herself and her children
with their eating habits - he does
make a number of excellent points.
And he clearly means well, as you
can tell from his red face and teary
eyes. While looking through the
elementary school cafeteria and
observing what's in the chicken
nuggets and potatoes, he concedes
that he understands he's bitching
about it. But he goes on to justify his
anger by saying: "If you're a parent,
it should piss you off too."
Oliver is faced with quite a stub-
bornly defensive town. There are
a lot of set-in-their-ways school
lunch ladies who don't want their
meal plans screwed around with,
and more than a few who believe
he can't accomplish actual change.
Yet this opposition isn't completely
unfounded. There certainly is some
doubt as to whether Oliver can real-
ly accomplish what he means to do,

especially when the school principal
has him serving his healthy food as
an option alongside the lunch ladies'
chocolate milk and pizza. Even an
idiot knows you don't give kids a
choice if you want them to make the
right one.
However, this feeling of futil-
ity and his underdog status does
make us root for him, even when
he repeatedly shouts "welcome to
America" in his frustration. We get
it Oliver, you're British. If the two or
three times you mentioned it didn't
get the point across, your accent
surely did the trick.
But most people of the town do
seem to need, and often genuinely
want, the help. Huntington, W. Va.
is introduced as one of the most ram-
pantly obese towns in America. Many
locals seem to be looking to change.
Even if they're sometimes skeptical,
there's a glimmer of hope. Few are as
enthusiastic about having the show
in town as the local preacher, who
says "I believe that God has you guys
here." It's difficult to question the
good intentions of a show that seeks
to teach healthy eating habits, even
taking into account the financial dif-
ficulties this can present.
All in all, "Jamie Oliver's Food
Revolution" is surely worth awatch.
However, you may want to peel a few
carrots and eat an apple in lieu of
popcorn, unless you want to be cow-
ering terrified behind your couch by
the end of the show.

Having just arrived in Maine
for a show at Bates College, Tyler
Duncan, the founding member
of the Ann
Arbor- My Dear Disco
based band
My Dear preSeli:The
Disco, had DanceThink
reached T
the point of Tiathion
exhaustion. Tonight, starting
But that at5 p.m.
didn't stop Various locations
him from and prices
kindly tak-
ing a call.
My Dear Disco,-a band com-
posed of University alums, is one
of the most buzzed-about bands
in Ann Arbor's burgeoning music
Starting tonight, My Dear
Disco will host "My Dear Disco
Presents: The DanceThink Tri-
athlon," an event that has been in
the works for the last two years.
The event will highlight the
diverse music community that
exists in Ann Arbor.
The triathlon will have three
parts: a pre-party at BTB Cantina
featuring DJ Seek Selekta, DJ
Malvin and Draconum; the main
event: My Dear Disco live at The
Michigan League Ballroom; and
an after party at The Circus fea-
turing resident Ann Arbor pow-
erhouses Body Rock and Jamie
Register and Glendales.
The Daily recently spoke with
Duncan about his enthusiasm for
the band's Ann Arbor roots, their
innovative, self-defined music
genre and why April 2nd's "My
Dear Disco Presents: The Dan-
ceThink Triathlon" is ultimately
the precursor to the next step for
the band.
My Dear Disco prides itself
on creating its own music genre,
often describing its sound as
"DanceThink." It's virtually
impossible to scan the indie
music blogosphere without being
bombarded by intricately and
sometimes ridiculously defined
music genres like "Lo-fi chill
wave, electrically-synthed-tech-
no pop." My Dear Disco hasn't
been cornered by media misla-

beling, though.
"We're at a point today where
the genres created are starting
to become more and more obso-
lete," Duncan said. "With the
ability to create music across the
entire world, the influences that
are coming out are becoming so
large that it can't be put under
one genre."
My Dear Disco, complete with
a laptop-composed sound juxta-
posed with the occasional bag-
pipe, most certainly refuses to be
placed under one specific genre.
Except for their own, that is.
"The 'Dance' part refers to the
techno elements of our music
and the 'Think' portion refers
to the University and our time
at the music school and that fact
that we are students," Duncan
said.
"As a band we're like techno,
pop, funkjazz and Irish bagpipes
- and French - and we're get-
ting into using the megaphone,"
he added. "So it's basically an
umbrella for the description, and
it's also something that we can
grow and evolve underneath."
Tonight's performance will
enable the band to present its
ever-evolving sound to a budding
fanbase.
"We have definitely grown,
and this show is going to be a
really good example of that,"
Duncan said. "We want to pres-
ent the next version of My Dear
Disco."

and The Cure, produced My Dear
Disco's debut album Dancethink
LP. There's a fun electro-pop
dance vibe to their tracks, but
also hints of brooding punk-rock
embedded within.
"The new sound is definitely
homing in on a specific, nuanced
and even more identifiable style
that we're developing," Dun-
can said. "It incorporates a lot
more idioms of dance. We're also
focusing a lot more on the emo-
tional content of our lyrics."
Sure - these key components
of the band's progression are
admirable, but their homemade,
harmonious "keytar" puts them
all to shame.

"Our singer Michelle (Chamu-
el) is using a homemade 'keytar'
to home in on the harmonies to
synthesize her voice," he added.
"It basically sounds like an entire
orchestra with her voice behind
her."
When asked how his time at
the University influenced the
band's sound, Duncan gushed
about his experience as a student.
My Dear Disco was formed while
the band members were sopho-
mores, and Duncan has plenty of
fond memories of his first flirta-
tions with the concept of becom-
ing a musician.
Duncan recalls his favorite
undergraduate memory - their
first show was sold out at The
Blind Pig - as the ultimate wake
up call.
"The place was packed and
filled wall-to-wall with UM stu-
dents," he said. "I remember
peeking out behind sound-check
thinking, 'You got to be kidding."'
But Duncan didn't rely just on
his musical talent throughout
college. He also put his intellec-
My Dear Disco
presents a three-
parter.
tual pursuits and proficiency to
good use in crafting a sense and
appreciation for music.
"We're definitely an intellec-
tual group of people," he said.
"We analyze pop tracks and
the radio and we'll spend hours
talking about it - what it means
and doesn't mean and analyzing
Michael Jackson tracks and Daft
Punk tunes. So there's a lot of
thought and effort that goes into
music and that can definitely get
lost."
Tonight, My Dear Disco
is excited to return home for
what they expect will be a well
received, raucous performance.
Duncan raved, "Ann Arbor just
has a great energy and our fans
have been extremely loyal and
enthusiastic, which is more than
we could ask for. "

Percussion Ensemble makes worldly beats

By BRAD SANDERS
Daily Arts Writer
This performance, titled "Introduc-
tions," mixes sounds that are uncommon-
ly heard together and
derived from countries
all around the world. Percussion
The ensemble's con- Ensemble
ductor, professor of IntoductionS
music Joseph Gramley,
recently took over the Saturday
role of his colleague, at 3 p.m.
professor of music E.V. Moore Building
Michael Udow, who Free
directed the ensemble
for 28 years. Gramley
has traveled abroad
with other groups and has recorded
music with Grammy award-winning art-
ist Yo-Yo Ma.
"Percussion music has been around
I for centuries and was one of the first

examples of what we might call cham-
ber music," Gramley said. "Someone like
Yo-Yo Ma who thinks outside of our bor-
ders and is about cross-pollination is the
perfect example of what we're doing in
this ensemble, which is to branch out and
play music from all over."
Being acore part of the percussion per-
formance major in the School of Music,
Theatre & Dance, the members of the
ensemble put hours of practice into form-
ing a successful performance, on top of
their coursework.
"We practice three days a week in class
time, but also the students have to learn
their parts in their own time," Gramley
explained. "It's a deep commitment that
these students have, and you have to have
that in all of chamber music to succeed
and to communicate that to the audience."
Included in the performance will be
pieces composed in Ann Arbor, New York,
Tokyo and New Zealand, with instru-

ments ranging from marimba to micro-
phone feedback.
The percussion ensemble's perfor-
mance will highlight the talents of 20
guest performers, including Dan Pic-
colo, a University alum and founder of
the group Starbrand, a local percussion
group.
"The ensemble will be playing a piece
that I have written specifically for the
event, titled 'PTA,' " Piccolo wrote in
an e-mail interview with The Michigan
Daily. "It will feature members of my
group Starbrand, which includes some
members of the local group 'My Dear
Disco,' who are all University alums. I
will be playing tabla (the hand drums of
North Indian classical music) and two
members of my group, Mike Shea and Bob
Lester, will be playing the drum set and
electronics, respectively."
This particular song includes custom
instruments designed specifically for

the piece, including six PVC tubes, vari-
ous sizes of wooden boxes and a Rube
Goldberg-style machine (which performs
a simple task through a complex process)
with several objects attached to it and
hooked up to contact microphones.
Introductions'
mixes sounds not
often mixed.
"The piece is inspired by drum and
bass music and uses mostly acoustic per-
cussion instruments to mimic the unique
sonic texture of the style," Piccolo wrote.
"The sounds from the custom instru-
ments are electronically processed to
produce some really exciting sounds. The

music for the ensemble is quite challeng-
ing, mostly due to the speed at which very
intricate rhythms need to be played."
In addition to the performance, the
ensemble is also recording a CD set to
come out in September consisting of
music all composed by University alumni.
"We received a grant from the UM
OVPR (Office of Vice President of
Research)," Gramley said. "UM is a world
leading research university, and some of
the music school's research can be perfor-
mance. It is produced by Block M Records
and will be released online and available
on iTunes."
Gramley has encouraging words for
those who may not want to trek to North
Campus in order to see the concert.
"I want students to embrace some
music that they may never have seen
before, and not to be afraid to come on
the bus to see us," Gramley said. "This is a
new genre of music."


ARTS IN BRIEF

THEATERPREVIEW
A morning after with
'How Love is Spelt'
How Love is Spelt
Tonight at 7 and 11 p.m.,
tomorrow at 7 p.m.
Walgreen Drama Center
Free
Almost everyone has experienced, or at
least heard of, an awkward morning-after
story. In Basement Arts's latest produc-
tion, "How Love Is Spelt," students get to
see this scenario explored (many a time)
in emotional detail through lead charac-
ter Peta (Tedra Millan, Music, Theatre &
Dance senior), upon her arrival in London
from Liverpool.
"The show is important because it is
relevant to the collegiate lifestyle," wrote
director Laura Winnick, LSA junior, in an
e-mail interview. "(Chloe) Moss's writing
muses on topics far too familiar to the Uni-
versity demographic - in general, the con-

sequences of going out, getting drunkand
returning home with a stranger."
"(The show) explores drunkenness,
inhibition, love, relationships, sex and
identity," Winnick added. "It explores
being alone and scared in a big city and
turning to strangers for guidance."
Each scene brings in new characters,
whose interactions with Peta range from
"ridiculous to heartfelt," according to Win-
nick. As the situations unfold, audiences
will see that Peta has been hiding some-
thing from herself, and each new char-
acter helps her realize it. Through witty
dialogue and heart-warming moments, the
play delves deeply into the idea of relation-
ships and what we seek to gain from them
- whether it be from a stranger or a close
friend.
As the semester winds down, time is
running out to see the free student-pro-
duced theater put on by Basement Arts.
"People should see it because it is a shame-
less way to reflect on their own morning-
after experiences," Winnick wrote, "without
having to send the awkward 'What's your
name again?' text message."
EMMA JESZKE

Kirstie Alley returns with
Bg LifeA' and little motivation
By CHRISTINA ANGER the lives of people trying to lose weight of yo-yo dieting, and her seven minute
Daily Arts Writer - in the same boat as shows like "Biggest of exercise with five-pound weights isn

es
i't

As a spokeswoman for Jenny Craig,
Kirstie Alley has
alreadylost 80 pounds.
In the past, she has
been the butt of tab- Kirstie Alley's
loid and talk-show
jokes, and in response, Big Life
she defiantly lost the Sundays at
weight. But now Alley 10nd.M a
is back to fat, and she 10p.m.
isn't afraid to say it. A&E
"Kirstie Alley's Big
Life" on A&E chronicles her second round
of weight loss, shedding light on the ups
and downs of a formerly thin celeb gone
big again. Alley is again discouraged by
the paparazzi's obesity obsession, but that
doesn't stop her from pulling a self-directed
fat joke in almost every scene of the show.
After the first few times, it sounds less like
a joke or personal motivator and more likea
coping method that isn't working.
Alley has a crazy, complicated "Big
Life," just like more than half of America.
A&E's new show is just another look into

Loser," "Ruby" and "One Big Happy Fam-
ily." Nobody said those shows were good,
but they do have one thing that "Big Life"
lacks -inspiration.
The pilot episode shows Alley doing
literally nothing to jump-start her weight
loss. One scene finds her on the floor of her
exercise room, admitting that she worked
out for just seven minutes. Even her two
grown kids, Lillie and William, don't seem
to encourage her at all. When Alley asks
them to work out, they decline. And even
better, when she asks them if her being
fat embarrasses them, her son shrugs and
gives her a resounding and helpful "not
really."
One thing's for sure: Alley has the same
kooky attitude she has always had. She's
loud and fun - albeit a bit lonely - but
she just doesn't seem serious enough. And
neither do many of the people around her.
"Big Life" feels likea lazy look into weight
loss, in which there's the obvious goal
to be thin, but no interest in the benefits
that come with a healthier lifestyle. Alley
never once mentions the medical dangers

exactly moving.
If seeking motivation to lose weight,
"Big Life" isn't the place to turn. Sure,
Alley can shed the pounds, but it takes
more than a scale and a smaller dress size
to measure success. Any well-informed
trainer will advocate a change in lifestyle
over any fad diet, and that's where Alley
falls short.
Seven minutes of
exercise does not a
workout make.
This is why "Big Life" inadvertently
works against Jenny Craig. The diet obvi-
ously doesn't support a continuous healthy
lifestyle once the pounds are shed. Alley's
show is one big oxymoron, but if half-
hearted weight loss sounds interesting,
go for it.

HOUSING
From Page 1
Assembly and LSA Student Gov-
ernment elections.
MSA President Chris Arm-
strong has been a vocal advocate
of gender-neutral housing, which
was a central push of his party
MForward's recent campaign.
Gender-neutral housing will be
at the top of MSA's agenda come
fall, Armstrong said in an inter-
view last night.
"The ball will be rolling within
the administration and among
students to work together to
implement gender-neutral hous-
ing," he said.
Armstrong said he thinks the
best way to do this is to create a
working group - made up of both
administrators and students -
within University Housing to
discuss the best ways to bring
gender-neutral options to resi-
dence halls.
In a similar attempt to quantify
ARGO DAM

removal of trees and brush, both
living and dead, and rthe removal
of their roots, which make the
embankment prone to leakage.
The press release also stated
that "the City must also develop a
vegetation management plan that
will include both short- and long-
term strategies for managing all
of the woody vegetation on the
embankment."
According to Ann Arbor City
Councilmember Sabra Briere
(D-Ward 1), however, the need
for maintenance is a "no news
thing." The state has repeatedly
approached the city regarding the
dam's upkeep, she said.
What made MDNRE's demands
so controversial, however, was
the suggestion that the dam be
removed. Many rowing teams -
includingthe MichiganMen's Club
Rowing team - were concerned
about losing the dam because they
use the pond for practice.
Though MDNRE originally
cited a lack of upkeep of the
embankment as the reason for the
removal of the dam, some local
groups began arguing for the
dam's removal based on environ-

system's ventilation component.
"This particular tank we clean
out about three times a year and
we have been following the proper
clean out system but it is not vent-
ingcorrectly," Logan said.
When officials opened the tank
on Monday, it released an odor
into the surrounding area around
Mosher-Jordan and Palmer Field,
Logan said.

student support for a gender-neu-
tral housing option, the topic was
also a component of the LSA-SG
ballot during last month's elec-
tions. The question was put onto
the ballot in an effort to reach out
to a larger body of students who
are no longer living in the resi-
dence halls.
On LSA-SG's online ballot,
students were asked to respond
to whether they support gender-
neutral housing in the residence
halls.*The ballot question stated
that students would have the
ability to choose gender-neutral
housing as an option and if imple-
mented, students would still be
able to choose to live with stu-
dents of the same gender.
The proposal also stated that
students wouldn't be placed with
someone of a different gender if
they choose to room blind.
LSA Freshman Katie McGillis
- a resident of Alice Lloyd Resi-
dence Hall who took the survey
- said that while she's in favor
of gender-neutral housing, she's

concerned about the Gender Neu-
tral Housing Coalition's implica-
tions.
"I think that gender neutral
housing is a good idea for stu-
dents who don't feel comfortable
rooming with someone of their
same sex," she said. "It should be
an option for these students, but
I don't think it should be manda-
tory in any dorm because I think
that most people would not feel
comfortable rooming with a per-
son of the opposite sex."
Kinesiology junior Kyle Fein-
auer said he didn't take the survey
and was indifferent to the idea of
gender-neutral housing. He said
that co-ed halls already exist,
so having a gender-neutral hall
wouldn't change the environment
of the residence halls for him.
Rackham graduate student Jes-
sica Johnson said that at the uni-
versity where she completed her
undergraduate degree there were
situations in which people felt
uncomfortable living in same-sex
arrangements.

She said that gender-neutral
housing would be a great step,
especially if it will keep the Uni-
versity from lagging behind other
universities already implement-
ing gender-neutral housing poli-
cies.
LSA sophomore Alex Edwards,
a resident of East Quad Residence
Hall, said he feels gender-neutral
housing should be an option avail-
able to all students and is a matter
of human rights.
"At a university that prides
itself on creating a comfortable
and welcoming environment for
its students, not having a gender-
neutral housing option is a huge
injustice," Edwards said. "Pro-
viding a gender-neutral housing
option is a simple yet meaningful
step in the struggle for equality on
behalf of the transgendered com-
munity and University at large."
Members of the Gender Neutral
Housing Coalition will be meeting
today to draw up a comprehensive
resolution using the results of the
survey, according to O'Leary.

Barnero says
Dillon is not
supportive of
he alth care bill

In governor race,
Lansing mayor aims
to tie house speaker
to Republicans
LANSING (AP) - Lansing
Mayor Virg Bernero yesterday
cast aspersions on the Demo-
cratic credentials of his main
gubernatorial rival, questioning
why House Speaker Andy Dillon
isn't more supportive of the new
federal health care law and try-
ing to tie him to Republicans.
Speaking outside the Capi-
tol, Bernero cited a newsletter
article published last Friday in
which Dillon said he wasn't sure
if he would have voted for the
federal health care law.
"I haven't read it," Dillon
told the Michigan Information
& Research Service newsletter,
which covers state government
and politics. "It's about 2,000
pages long."
Bernero has criticized Repub-
lican Attorney General Mike
Cox, who's also running for
governor, for joining 13 other
attorneys general to challenge
the health care laws on consti-
tutional grounds.
He said Dillon needs to do
more to oppose Cox's efforts.
"I don't see Andy Dillon get-
ting a resolution passed trying
to stop Mike Cox from wasting
taxpayers' money on this ridicu-
lous legal boondoggle," Bernero
said. "How is it that Andy Dillon
can't make up his mind about
something this important?"
Dillon spokesman Ken Coleman
said Dillon has expressed support
for the measures dozens of times.
He said Dillon wants to ana-
lyze what's in the new laws and
how they will affect state ser-
vices as the complex measures
unfolds over the next four years.
"Citizens are desperately
wanting a thoughtful approach
to making sure this law gets

implemented to the benefit
of millions of Michiganders,"
Coleman said. "The health care
act is the law of the land and
now it's up to the states to find
out how to best implement it to
serve Michigan residents."
Bernero asserted the Dillon
campaign was "beginning to do
some backpedaling that would
rival that of a circus clown on a
unicycle."
Dillon sent out a campaign
e-mail yesterday evening saying
he supports the federal health
care law. In a dig at Bernero, he
said "we need a governor with
vision, not venom."
The two Democrats are
locked in fierce competition for
the party's nomination, with
state Rep. Alma Wheeler Smith
also in the race. Cox and four
others are running for the GOP
nomination. Democratic Gov.
Jennifer Granholm must step
down at year's end because of
term limits.
Although it's likely Dillon has
a lead in fundraising, Bernero has
won the endorsement of many of
the state's major labor unions.
But neither Bernero nor Dil-
lon, a lawyer and former busi-
ness-turnaround specialist from
Wayne County's Redford Town-
ship, are well-known to voters
statewide. Polls show around
half of Democratic voters remind
undecided, and Bernero is try-
ing to capitalize on voters' lack
of knowledge to paint his more
moderate opponent as lacking
true Democratic credentials.
"April Fool's Day is a good
time to remind people who
think he is a decisive leader and
a strong Democrat that the joke
is on them," the mayor said.
Dillon is addressing health
care costs with a proposal to
place all public employees -
teachers, university employees
and state and local government
workers - into one health care
program that would be negoti-
ated by the state.

Ann Arbor's Argo Dam yesterday. City officials recently received word from the state that the dam will be allowed to remain in
tact -as long as it is cleaned properly -despite an order from state officials last year that the dam be repaired or removed.

mental concerns.
Briere said the decision to
remove the dam cannot be one
based solely on the dam's integ-
rity, as the cement dam itself is in
excellent condition. Instead, she
said that the river's best interest
must be kept in mind when decid-
ing what to do with the dam.
"Personally, I'm really fond of

the pond, but I'm willing to con-
sider whether it's better for the
river to have the pond gone," Bri-
ere said. "I have to believe it's bet-
ter, scientifically, for the river to
have the pond gone."
Briere added that not all envi-
ronmental activists think remov-
ing the dam is a good idea.
"Not all people who support

doing good things for the envi-
ronment supported removing the
dam," she said.
Briere said if the city does
decide to remove the dam, the
decision will have to come in the
future because, currently, the city
can't afford to build the park that
would be created by the dam's
removal.


Many students living in the area
said they've noticed the odor for
quite some time, but they couldn't
tell where it was coming from.
LSA sophomore Jessica Kildea
said the odor smells like "eggs and
sewage," and that she first smelled
it last year. She said she can some-
times even smell it from her room
in Stockwell Residence Hall if she
has the windows open.
"Sometimes it gets really bad and
travels over here to Stockwell but
most of the time it's just over there
toward Alice Lloyd," Kildea said.

Music, Theatre & Dance soph-
omore Briana Stuart said she
thought the odor may have been
coming from the smoke stacks in
the buildings near Mosher-Jordan,
adding that recently the smell has
become much more common.
"I noticed it (at) the beginning of
the school year but more often now
I've been smelling it," Stuart said.
"I think I probably smelled it at
least two or three times this week."
Engineering freshman Jonathan
Rubins said he also noticed the smell
at the beginning of the year and

probably once every couple of weeks.
"When I walked outside, I'd keep
my nose shut and breathe through
my mouth," Rubins said.
Though the smell may be
unpleasant, Logan said the odor
isn't a threat to public health.
The University is currently try-
ing to determine a time to clean the
tank and inspect the ventilation
system.
"We will try to schedule a time
that will minimize further annoy-
ance to students' noses," Logan
said.

Lawrence Cann, founder and

experience working at a homeless

graduation from college in 2002.

From Page 1
University students and salon
employees are concerned about
the tax.
School of Art & Design fresh-
man Jackie San Fillipo said that
even with the 10-percent tax
increase, she would not stop get-
ting her bi-monthly tans.
"My tans are usually around
$10 so I wouldn't stop going from
a one dollar increase," San Fillipo
said. "I think that people will still
go, because there are still really
expensive sprays and beds and I
still see people going all the time."
LSA freshman Emily Abrash
said that, if implemented, the tan-
ning tax will discourage her from
going to Campus Tan op Church
Street - the tanning salon she fre-
quented this past winter.

shelter, Cann said he decided to
form Street Soccer USA in 2005.
He said the goal of the organiza-
tion is to provide the homeless
with a sense of community and
reduce the stigma they often face
about their living situation.
"These individuals are seen for
what they are lacking," Cann said.
"We wanted to make their posi-
tive attributes visible."
Street Soccer USA now has 16
teams throughout the nation. The
organization competes against
54 teams in other countries dur-
ing the Homeless World Cup held
each year, according to Cann.
SSPORT practices throughout
the year for the Street Soccer USA
Cup held in Washington D.C. each
summer. This year it hopes to

compete in the Homeless World
Cup in Brazil in September 2010.
Since Silvennoinen started the
Washtenaw County team in 2007,
she has coached the Street Soc-
cer USA National team that com-
peted for the Homeless World
Cup in Australia. Last year, one
of the SSPORT players qualified
for the Homeless World Cup in
Milan.
Silvennoinen said SSPORT
is important because it helps
inspire the homeless to turn their
lives around. Many players have
entered substance abuse recovery
programs or returned to school as
a result of their experience, Sil-
vennoinen said.
She added that one homeless
individual, who was a member of

the team in the past, decided to go
back to school and enrolled at the
University.
Cann said the teams help par-
ticipants to develop a "good work
ethic" and other skills they can
use to improve their lives.
"With the qualities that the
teams build in individuals, there
is really nothing that can keep
someone from finding a home,"
Cann said.
Silvennoinen said the team not
only benefits the homeless but
also county residents who get a
chance to play soccer and make
new friends.
"The team changes a lot of their
lives, and they give a lot of sup-
port to each other," Silvennoinen
said.


"I know (using tanning booths)
is bad for you, but I still go,"
Abrash said. "But if they're raising
taxes on it, that means that it's so
bad for you that you should prob-
ably stop going."
According to the National Can-
cer Institute, women who use
tanning beds more than once a
month are 55 percent more likely
to develop malignant melanomas
- the most dangerous form of skin
cancer.
Katie Johnson, manager of
Tanfastic, which has salons on
Washtenaw and S. Main Street,
said her business will be affected
by the tax because customers will
now have to pay more to get their
bronze glow.
"Clients are going to have to pay
10 percent more than they already
pay," Johnson said. "Tanning is a
luxury, so any disposable income
that people want to spend is (being

spent) here, so of course (the tax)
is goingto affect business."
Some businesses have already
opted to take a different route to
counteract the financial strainthat
tanning consumers will endure as
a result of the tax increase.
"We're already planning on
lowering our cost (to) where it
won't affect our customers," said
Kelly Keeton, owner of Big House
Tan on South University Avenue.
Keeton, who opened her tan-
ning salon in five separate loca-
tions, said the small businesses
in the tanning industry will take
a major hit with the institution of
the tax increase.
"The tax is targeting small busi-
ness, and the majority of salon
owners are women," Keeton said.
"It's like they're picking on the
small business and making things
hard especially in this economy."
But Udow-Phillips has a differ-

ent take on the issue.
"I don't think it's hurting small
businesses - first of all, it's not
going make a big difference in
terms of actual business," Udow-
Phillips said. "I think people will
go regardless. And second of all,
there's so much that helps small
business (in the bill) and I think
it will more than make up for the
increase in business costs."
Some tanning salons are already
in the process of protesting the tax
increase, calling for its immediate
repeal.
"We have flyers in each room for
a (website) that clients can go to
try to stop the tanning tax," John-
son said. "It's our responsibility
as a company to make our clients
aware of what's going to happen if
they do enforce this tax. It's just
really important that our clients
know what's happening, because it
will affect them."

Christian militia
lured to warehouse
unarmed for fake
memorial service
DETROIT (AP) - Five mem-
bers of a Midwest Christian
militia accused of conspiring to
overthrow the government were
lured to a warehouse to attend a
phony memorial service so they
would be unarmed when author-
ities arrested them, Michigan's
chief federal agent said Thurs-
day.
The ruse in Ann Arbor was
part of a series of weekend raids
in several states that resulted in
the indictment of nine people in
the alleged plot, officials said.
"We basically set up a scenario
where we were able to draw them
all to one location," Andrew
Arena, the FBI's special agent in
charge in Detroit, told The Asso-
ciated Press. "And the reason
we did that was to obviously get
them away from their weapons."
Nine suspected members of a
group called the Hutaree based
in southern Michigan's Lenawee
County were charged this week
with seditious conspiracy, or
plotting to levy war against the
U.S., attempting to use weapons
of mass destruction and other
crimes.
They planned to make a false
911 call, kill responding police
officers and set off a bomb at
the funeral to kill many more,
according to prosecutors. The
FBI said it broke up the plot with
the help of an undercover agent
and informants.
Eight of the suspects are in
custody in the Detroit area. The
ninth is being held in Indiana.
U.S. District Court Magis-
trate Judge Donald A. Scheer in
Detroit said Thursday he needed
more time to decide whether to
grant prosecutors' request that
the eight remain locked up until
trial. A decision was expected
Friday.

Urging Scheer to deny the
request for bond, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Joseph Falvey Jr. said
that while there is nothing wrong
with owning guns or hating the
government, it is illegal when
"people with dark hearts and evil
intents" gather to discuss ways to
commit violence.
Releasing the defendants
would allow them to regroup and
would increase their fear of law
enforcement, Falvey said.
The Hutaree are self-pro-
claimed "Christian warriors"
who trained themselves in para-
military techniques in prepara-
tion for what they say on their
Web site is a battle against the
Antichrist.
Defense attorneys told Scheer
that no evidence against the
group has been aired outside the
indictment.
Kristopher Sickles, 27, of San-
dusky, Ohio, issued a statement
late Thursday in which he said
he is "not an extremist, racist or
a cop killer." In the statement,
released by his brother, Alec
Romick of Huron, Ohio, Sickles
said he is "simply guilty by asso-
ciation and personally had no
intentions of harming any per-
son, member of law enforcement
or the United States govern-
ment."
Arena said the FBI started
looking into the Hutaree nearly
two years ago based on "informa-
tion from the public" he wouldn't
disclose.
An undercover agent infiltrat-
ed the group, becoming part of
suspected ringleader David Brian
Stone's inner circle, making
explosive devices under Stone's
supervision and attending meet-
ings and special family events,
authorities said.
They said the agent accom-
panied Stone and others to a
planned meeting of militias in
Kentucky in February. They were
forced to turn back in India-
napolis because of bad weather,
but the agent recorded a speech
to those in the van by a speaker
identified as Stone.

Robinson talks defensive
improvement in year two

Colombos this weekend atter finishing in second last year.
Men's gymnastics
headst BighTens
to face tough foes

By RYAN KARTJE
Daily Sports Editor
When Greg Robinson came to
Michigan last season after his pre-
vious job as head coach at Syra-
cuse, he immediately became part
of the upheaval
that has come NOTEBOOK
to characterize
Rich Rodriguez's tenure as head
coach.
It was a season full of struggles
on defense, and the Wolverines
finished in the lower tier of every
Big Ten statistical category. Dur-
ing the second half of the sea-
son, Robinson refused to speak
with the media. His first meeting
with reporters since then yester-
day was abounds with questions
about possible improvements on
the defensive side of the ball.
"I don't know that the outside
world needs to be confident,"
Robinson said of his defense this
upcoming season. "You might
want to be, but you know what,
you're not going to be confident
until you go out there and see
a group play well. I can sit here
and say all this and say that, but
I think that every year is differ-
ent."
And according to Robinson, the
biggest issue was the Wolverines'
serious lack of depth.
"If you go back and look at all
the things I said prior to the sea-
son last spring and summer, I like
to think that I told you the biggest
concern I had was depth," Robin-
son said. "And I said it to you all
the time. And quite frankly, that's
really what came to hurt us. We
had inexperience. We had some
issues with personnel. We just
didn't have alot of depth."
Despite the unit's troubles,
Robinson specifically referred
to losses at Iowa and Michigan
State as examples of the defense's
improvement.
But even in those games -
which were both lost in the clos-

dual meet.
"(Illinois) is goingto be right up
there with us," junior Chris Cam-
eron said. "There are no two teams
that are easily as matched as us
and Illinois in the entire country.
They're going to be right with us
and right with us at NCAA too, and
it's up to us to beat them. We defi-
nitely recognize them as a threat
to our possible titles."
Another hurdle, almost as dan-
gerous as the Fighting Illini, will
be No. 5 Ohio State.
Michigan is coming off a 10.65-
point trouncing of the Buckeyes in
the final dual meet of the season.
Last year, then-sophomore
Thomas Kelley won the all-around
competition, and Cameron fin-
ished right behind him. And after
senior Mel Santander's record-
breaking performance against
Ohio State, he is hoping to join
Kelley and Cameron in the ranks
of the all-around crown winners.
"I feel that between Chris,
Mel and I, if we have a solid per-
formance on five events, then
that's going to be pretty good for
our team standings," Kelley said.
"That's the number-one goal right
now."
Throughout the season, Michi-
gan has had trouble putting
together a complete performance.
Before the team's March 20
matchup with Ohio State, when it
had a season-best score, it usually

had one or two sloppy events.
But after that performance
against the Buckeyes, Michigan
coach Kurt Golder is seeing his
team peak at the right time.
"I think it's an accumulation
of all the work we've been doing
and it finally started to pay off,"
Golder said. "We've done a lot of
intersquad meets following the
same format that we'll compete
in and that will help the guys to
be familiar and know what to
expect."
Though it will probably be a very
close competition, the Wolverines
are looking to use their experience
and their ability to remain calm to
their advantage this weekend.
"We're just going to be aggres-
sive," Santander said. "Attack each
event one step at a time. Last year
around this time,tthe coaches
reminded us of three things: be
confident, be aggressive and also
be relaxed while doing it. That
definitely helped us last season so
hopefully it will this season, too."
In a tournament-style meet like
Big Tens, each team begins at a
specific rotation. Not only is the
opening event important, but it
also determines the event that the
team will end on. And Michigan
has had many meets this year in
which they have closed very well,
so they will hope to do that again
this weekend.
"It's the combination of the two
because you definitely want to get
off to a good start, but then the
pressure is on at the end," Golder
said. "Those are the two pressure
points, the first event and the last
event. You always try to end on an
event that's either high scoring or
you're comfortable with."
After this weekend in Colum-
bus, the Wolverines will have just
two weeks before their final meet
of the season - NCAAs, which
take place in West Point, N.Y.
"If we win, we'll be motivated to
continue what we're doing," Kel-
ley said. "If we lose, we'll be super
pissed and even more motivated to
avenge our loss. Ultimately, we're
taking one meet at a time and los-
ing isn't really an option. We're not
going in there with that mindset."

ing moments - inexperience and
a shallow depth chart, according
to Robinson, were the main rea-
sons for defeat.
With a full season under their
belt though, defensive players are
beginning to look more comfort-
able in his system, which would
presumably give the Wolverines
more options at each position.
"I think our guys are absorb-
ing fine," Robinson said. "As the
offense comes at us with another
wrinkle here, another wrinkle
there, it's testing us, which is
good."
FORMATIONS THEY ARE A
CHANGIN': Last week, Rodriguez
announced that the Wolverines
will increasingly work out of a
3-3-5 set, with slight tweaks to
Robinson's hybrid system from
last season.
But Robinson was quick to
point out that the new defense
was more of an adjustment than a
change in philosophy.

"I don't know that I've ever
been in a defense where there
wasn't areas altered each year
to your personnel or to what the
offensive world is doing," Robin-
son said. "You have to do that. You
tweak constantly, and you do it
throughout the season."
Scheme changes, especially
those as slight as the team's
recent implementations, are also
nothing new to Robinson who
referenced his time in the NFL to
justify his idea of an ever-chang-
ing defense.
"There's very little that I
haven't done in my past," Rob-
inson said. "If you go back to
the New York Jets, we ran a 3-3
scheme ... When I went to Den-
ver, we were listed as a four-man
front, but we used a hybrid ... I've
coached for a while, and there's
been alot of time for me to do a lot
of things."
STEVIE AND THE SECOND-
ARY: One of the more important

positions in Robinson's scheme
has been the hybrid spinner posi-
tion, which last year was filled by
departing senior Stevie Brown.
As one of the positions in Rob-
inson's defense that requires the
most athleticism, Brown will be
hard to replace, especially with an
inexperienced secondary.
So far this spring, sophomore
Floyd Simmons has been taking
reps at the position, along with
redshirt freshman Thomas Gor-
don and junior Mike Williams.
After a much-maligned season at
safety last season, Robinson feels
that Williams's athleticism is
well suited to move to the spinner
position.
At the safety position - which
is even less experienced with Wil-
liams's departure - Robinson
also said he was impressed with
the development of safety Cam-
eron Gordon who moved from the
wide receiver position this offsea-
son.

Foul issues doomed'M'inWNJT

Freshman guard Dayeesha
Hollins scored eight points in the
first half of the Michigan women's
basketball team's 76-59 loss to
Miami on Wednesday night. But
during the 10 minutes before half-
time, she rode the bench due to a
pair of quick fouls.
Along with Hollins on the pine
sat the Wolverines' momentum
with a towel over its shoulder.
The 11-point lead Michigan
enjoyed in the first six minutes of
the WNIT final four match slowly
evaporated every minute Hollins
sat.
And the Hurricanes had an
opportunity to rally back and take
a 37-33 lead into the half.
"Dayeesha was playing huge
in the beginning of that game,"
junior guard Veronica Hicks said.
"She was doinga dynamite job out
there. She had a few tough calls....
As a unit we have to learn to pick
it up no matter what, and unfortu-
nately we didn't."

Not only did Michigan have to
sit two of its starters for a signifi-

was forced to rely on others, most
of whom aren't necessarily battle-

Suddenly freshmen Nya Jor-

more Courtney Boylan were
thrusted out on the court without
having seen much playing time in
the WNIT aside from late minutes
in the Wolverines' several blow-
outs.
The foul trouble didn't just
force Borseth to substitute start-
ers, but it was the first - and
last - time Michigan dealt with
foul trouble in its tournament
run. The fouls disrupted the
patterned offensive roster that
Borseth had instituted the entire
tournament.
"I didn't think we had any
chance unless we did it," Miami
coach Katie Meier said regarding
getting Phillips in foul trouble.
"That was definitely part of our
game plans ... we have to try to get
her away from the basket."

Blue prepares for Pitcher of the Year candidate _

Despite having already played 22
games, the Michigan baseball team
is determined that its 2009-10 sea-
son begins today.
The Wolverines will travel to
Bloomington,
Ind., where Michigan at

its first Big Ten
wins of the year.
"Getting back into conference
play, all the teams step it up and it's

really good baseball," senior pitcher
Eric Katzman said following Tues-
day's game against Eastern Michi-
gan. "I want to see how our team
will compete - the most hostile
atmosphere you are going to find is
within the conference."
Like most sports in the Big Ten,
baseball is wide open for teams to
reach the top. The Wolverines are
currently ranked third in the con-
ference according to their overall
record, following Michigan State
and Ohio State. But that is all apt to
change after a competitive Big Ten
opening weekend.
Michigan began its play at Ray
Fisher Stadium just a week ago, eas-
ily sweeping its three-game series
against Indiana University - Purdue
University Fort Wayne. On Tuesday,
Eastern Michigan gave the Wolver-
ines a greater challenge, as they bat-
ted back into the game from a 7-2
deficit. But Michigan maintained a
one-run advantage, and senior out-

fielder Mike Kittle made a big base
hit in the bottom of the seventh to
get the winning tally on the score-
board.
For the Wolverines to claim the
series this weekend at Sembower
Field, as with all their conference
games, they'll need to overcome
the inconsistency at the mound and
the plate that has been plaguing the
team for most of the season.
"We're just going to have to battle
and claw like the rest of the teams
in the Big Ten to find a way to get it
done," Michigan coach Rich Malo-
ney said. "It's just a matter of (the
team) executing a littler bit better."
Although the Hoosiers are in
fifth place with a 12-11 record, they
will still prove to be a tough series
for Michigan, with their main
threat being sophomore left-handed
pitcher Drew Leininger.
Leininger was recently named to
the College Baseball Foundation's
National Pitcher of the Year Watch

List and he has established himself
as one of the most improved college
baseball players this season. Leini-
nger boasts a 0.79 ERA, a 3-0 record
and 26 consecutive scoreless innings.
"They know that they're facing
[Leininger]," Maloney said. "But
he's not a big, overpowering type of
pitcher. But aleft-hander who mixes
up his stuff and hides the ball can be
difficult, so we're going to be in for
a dogfight."
Michigan will be utilizing its ace
pitcher, Alan Oaks, to return the
pressure on Indiana. If Oaks can
control the mound and Wolverine
batters produce at the plate, then
the team should be able to subdue
Leininger's golden arm.
"Every year, Michigan's expecta-
tion is to win," Katzman said. "We
don't think there is a team better
than us. So, if we play our game,
no matter how good anybody else
plays, I think we are going to finish
on top. We should."
