ontroversial professor Norman Finkelstein gives a speech about the current affairs in the Israel-Palestine conflict in the Rackham Ampitheatre last night.
Prof . alters plan, talks Gaza


At event, Finkelstein
spoke about Gaza
instead of lessons
from Gandhi
By BENJAMIN S. CHASE
Daily StaffReporter
Referring to the most recent
Israeli-Palestinian conflict as the
"Gaza massacre," Professor Nor-
man Finkelstein delivered a lecture
on Palestinian-Israeli relations to
a standing room-only crowd in the

Rackham Amphitheatre last night.
At the event, which was spon-
sored by the pro-Palestinian cam-
pus group, Students Allied for
Freedom and Equality, Finkelstein
strayed from his planned lecture,
"The Israel-Palestine Conflict:
What We Can Learn From Gandhi,"
opting instead to deliver a talk he
titled "What happened in Gaza?"
Finkelstein justified his depar-
ture from the planned lecture by
saying that the Gaza conflict is
more relevant.
Finkelstein has been the subject
ofmuchdebate overthe pastdecade.
In 2000 he published a book, "The

Holocaust Industry: Reflections on
the Exploitation of Jewish Suffer-
ing," thathasbeen widelydiscussed
as it claims that the Jewish Ameri-
cans have exploited the history of
Holocaust. DePaul University also
denied Finkelstein's bid for tenure
in 2007 citing his inability to show
respect for his colleagues' opinions,
among other reasons.
The mood in the lecture hall
grew increasingly tense during the
question-and-answer session fol-
lowing Finkelstein's lecture. The
debate grew heated, with audience
members arguing with one another
and Finkelstein.

Finkelstein said the most recent
conflict in Gaza was a continuation
of Israeli military policy that has
been in place since the 1967 Arab-
Israeli War. He added that the
policy is centered on Israelis ability
to prevent Hamas, Hezbollah and
its Arab neighbors from perpetrat-
ing attacks on Israel and its settle-
ments.
"The Arabs and Arab states are
supposed to be terrified by Israel,"
Finkelstein said.

ing majority of the world supports
a two-state solution to the Israeli-

For theDaily
Karen Boyd's resum6 has some
items one might not expect from
a candidate interviewing to be
the University's new dean of stu-
dents. She has performed as the
lead singer for a Pink Floyd cover
band and played Eve Ensler in
a production of "The Vagina
Monologues."
But Boyd, who has 20 years of
student leadership experience, is
one of three finalists to take on
that job on campus. Yesterday all
University students were invited
to a meet-and-greet with the
potential dean to voice their opin-
ions and play an active role in the
evaluation process.
During the informal lunch,

students were invited to discuss
campus issues with Boyd. After,
students were encouraged to
submit comments and feedback
online to have a say in the nar-
rowing of finalists from three to
one, according to an article in the
University Record.
If Boyd gets the job, it won't
be the first time she has worked
closely with students. As the
senior associate dean of student
life at the Georgia Institute of
Technology, she influenced stu-
dent ethical development and
provided leadership to student
activities, including Greek Life
and media services, according
to a biography released by the
University.
Boyd is also the former presi-

tors, an organization that aims to
set conduct standards for higher
education institutions. She'll also

By LINDY STEVENS
Daily News Editor
AtThursday'smeetingofthe Uni-
versity Board of Regents, the board
will discuss three new campus con-
struction projects up for approval.
The meeting is set to begin at 3 p.m.
in the Regents' Room of the Flem-

ing Administration Building.
The first project the board will
consider is a $2.1 million reno-
vation to the Residential College
Auditorium in East Quadrangle.
The 11,300-square-foot renovation
will provide updates, to the tech-
nology, lighting, stage and seating
areas. The remodel also includes
plans for accessibility updates to
meet codes and standards outlined
in the Americans with Disabilities
Act. Funding for the project will
come from the College of Litera-
ture, Science and the Arts, donor

gifts aid the University's General
Funod.
A $1.2 million, 8,300-square-foot
renovation to the Environental
and Water Resources Engineering
Building will also be discussed at
Thursday's meeting. Home to labo-
ratories, classrooms and offices for
the Department of Civil and Envi-
ronmental Engineering, the Col-
lege of Engineering will provide
funding for the project.

MSA pushes dorms to offer Saturday night meals

Plan would cost
an estimated
$300,000 or $30
per resident
By JENNA SKOLLER
Daily StaffReporter
The Michigan Student Assembly
passed a resolution at last night's
weekly meeting to address the lack
of Saturday night dining options in

University residence halls.
The resolution states that MSA
will write a letter to University
Housing, the Residence Halls Asso-
ciation and The Michigan Daily
emphasizing the assembly's sup-
port for keeping at least one dining
hall open on Saturday nights. It was
authored by LSA Reps. Timothy
Bekkers and Virat Gupta and Busi-
ness Rep. Alex Serwer,
It also said MSA will continue to
work with RHA to gather student
feedback and assess the feasibility
of implementing this option.

According to the resolution, it
would cost an estimated $300,000
per year for the University to keep
one dining hall open on Saturday
nights. This averages out to about
$30 per year for each resident hall
resident.
Bekkers said the resolution
would help students who are strug-
gling financially by providing more
inexpensive meal options.
"It's a pretty big social justice
issue also, because I think (closed
dining halls) hurt the people who
can least afford to be here at this

school already," he said.
Though the resolution passed
29-3, there was some opposition
from Residence Hall Association
President Ashley Londy. She said
that MSA's involvement might not
be the most effective way to imple-
ment Saturday night dining and
stressed that RHA will discuss the
issue Thursday
"I don't think it's necessarily the
most effective way when the man-
ager of dining says to get anything
done needs to come through RHA,"

LANSING, Mich.
Mich. lawmaker
wants caffeine on
energy drink labels
A lawmaker is pushing legislation
in Michigan to let' people see how
much caffeine is in energy drinks.
State Sen. Michael Switalski says
a "caffeine race" is escalating in the
marketplace. The Roseville Demo-
crat wants to require the makers of
Red Bull, 5-Hour Energy and other
drinks to put caffeine content on
their labels.
Switalski says the products are
marketed toward youth, and par-
ents need information to control
children's caffeine intake. The bill
may not get far because the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration
generally oversees food and bever-
age labeling.
Switalski on Thursday also rein-
troduced legislation to require ste-
roid testing of high school athletes,
eliminate tax breaks for vending
machine food retailers and limit
the sale of junk food in schools.

U.S., N. Korea trade
barbs as Clinton
visits Asia
Secretary of State Hillary Rod-
ham Clinton talked tough on her
first overseas trip as America's top
diplomat, delivering a sharp warn-
ing to North Korea on Tuesday over
its threat to conduct a missile test.
As she wound down a long day
of official events in Tokyo before
preparing for the next leg of her
Asia tour in Indonesia, Clinton said
North Korea's threatened missile
test would harm its prospects for
improved relations with the United
States and other neighbors.
"The possible missile launch
that North Korea is talking about
would be very unhelpful in moving
our relationship forward," she said,
adding that if Pyongyang wants to
end its isolation, it would have to act
on pledges made to previous Bush
administration negotiators to scale
back its nuclear weapons efforts.
"The decision as to whether
North Korea will cooperate in the
six-party talks, end provocative
language and actions is up to them
and we are watching very closely,"
Clinton said, referring to North
Korea's continuing talks with the
U.S. and four other major nations
over efforts to nudge the North to
abandon nuclear weapons.

the extremists a "safe haven."

sive in the former tourist haven and

UN say~s Afghan civ*lian
deaths j*umped 40percent

More than half the
deaths inflicted by
Taliban and militants
KABUL (AP) - The number of
civilians killed in Afghanistan's
worseningconflict jumped 40 per-
cent to a new high last year, and
more than half of the deaths were
inflictedby Taliban insurgents and
other militants, the United Nations
said Tuesday.
The report said insurgents
increasingly use roadside bombs,
car bombs and suicide bombers
in attacks that are "undertaken
regardless of the impact on civil-
ians." In the latest such attack, the
U.S. military reported a roadside
bomb killed five civilians Monday
in Kandahar province.
Two of the worst civilian tolls
from insurgent attacks came in a
February suicide bombing at a dog
fight in Kandahar that the U.N.
said killed 67 civilians and a car
bombing at the Indian Embassy
last July that killed 55 civilians.
Commanders of U.S. and other
international troops in Afghani-
stan have long sought to empha-
size how militant attacks kill far
more civilians than the soldiers or
officials targeted.
The U.N. said a record 2,118 civil-
ians died from violence last year, up
from 1,523 the previous year.
Its report blamed insurgent
attacks for 55 percent of the deaths
- 1,160, compared to 700 in 2007.
It said U.S., NATO and Afghan
government forces accounted
for 39 percent of those killed -
828, compared to 629 in 2007. No
responsibility was determined for
the remaining 130 deaths.
Taliban attacks have been
increasing for three years, and the
new U.S. administration is debat-

ing whether to send an additional
30,000 soldiers and Marines this
year to join 33,000 already in the
fight.
"As the conflict has intensified, it
is taking an increasingly heavy toll
on civilians," the U.N. report said.
Civilian deaths have been a
huge source of friction between
the international military forces
and Afghan President Hamid
Karzai, who has made increas-
ingly angry demands that U.S.
troops avoid killing ordinary
Afghans. He says civilian deaths
are undermining support for the
anti-Taliban fight.
The U.N. report noted that
despite new battlefield rules meant
to reduce civilian casualties, U.S.,
NATO and Afghan troops killed
31 percent more civilians last year
than in 2007.
That likely reflects the fact that
more foreign troops are in the
country. With more troops engag-
ing in clashes, more airstrikes are
used, increasing the chances that
ordinary Afghans are killed:
The U.N. report said 552 of the
civilian deaths attributed to for-
eign and government forces were
inflicted by airstrikes.
In an example of the complex-
ity of some cases, the U.S.-led
coalition said Tuesday that a
"precision strike" overnight in
Herat province killed a Taliban
commander and other insur-
gents. Police chief Ekremuddin
Yawar put the death toll at five
men, six women and two chil-
dren. He said the attack hit a
tent and two vehicles far from a
residential area, but it was dif-
ficult to know whether to clas-
sify the women and children as
militants.
The U.N. report cited a U.S.
raid on the western town of
Azizabad last August that a U.N.

investigation concluded killed 92
civilians, including 62 children. A
separate U.S. inquiry said 33 civil-
ians were killed.
After that and other high-profile
civilian death cases, the top U.S.
commander in Afghanistan, Gen.
David McKiernan, announced a
directive in September meant to
reduce such deaths. He ordered
commanders to consider breaking
away from a firefight in populated
areas rather than pursue militants
into villages.
In another step aimed at reduc-
ing deaths of ordinary people, the
American and Afghan militaries
announced earlier this month that
more Afghan soldiers would take
part in U.S. operations.
A NATO spokesman, Maj. Mar-
tin O'Donnell, said McKiernan's
directive was probably made too
late in the year to have an effect. "I
think the fruits of those initiatives
are yet to be seen," he said.
A U.S.-based group that advo-
cates for civilians in conflict said
in another report released Tues-
day that "the lack of a clear, coor-
dinated strategy to address civilian
losses has been a leading source of
anger and resentment toward mili-
tary forces" in Afghanistan.

Automakers ask
for extra $14B and
plan deep job cuts
DETROIT (AP) - General
Motors and Chrysler said yester-
day their request for federal aid
ballooned to a staggering $39 bil-
lion - only months after receiv-
ing billions in loans - in new
plans that envision massive job
losses and intense restructuring
to survive a deepening recession.
General Motors Corp. pre-
sented a survival plan that calls
for cutting a total of 47,000 jobs
globally and closing five more
U.S. factories, a move that rep-
resents the largest work force
reduction announced by a U.S.
company in the economic melt-
down. Chrysler LLC said it will
cut 3,000 more jobs and stop pro-
ducing three vehicle models.
The grim reports came as the
United Auto Workers union said
it had reached a tentative agree-
ment with GM, Chrysler and Ford
Motor Co. on contract changes.
Concessions with the union and
debt-holders were a condition of
the government bailout.
GM said it could need up to
$30 billion from the Treasury
Department, up from a previ-
ous estimate of $18 billion. That
includes $13.4 billion the com-
pany has already received. The
world's largest automaker said it
could run out of money by March
without new funds and needs $2
billion next month and another
$2.6 billion in April.
"We have a lot of work to do," GM
Chairman and Chief Executive Rick
Wagoner said. "We're still going at
this with a great sense of urgency."
GM's request includes a credit
line of $7.5 billion to be used if the
downturn is more pronounced
than expected. But the automaker
claimed it could be profitable intwo
years and repay its loans by 2017.
The requests pale in compari-
son to what it might cost taxpay-
ers if GM or Chrysler go bankrupt,

said Aaron Bragman, auto indus-
try analyst for the consulting firm
IHS Global Insight in Troy, Mich.
"These are not small, insig-
nificant organizations," he said.
"These are the lifeblood of Amer-
ican manufacturing."
The company looked into
three bankruptcy scenarios, all
of which would cost the govern-
ment more than $30 billion, GM
Chief Operating Officer Fritz
Henderson said. The worst sce-
nario would cost $100 billion
because GM's revenue would
severely drop, he said.
Although little is known about
whether people would buy cars
from a bankrupt automaker, some
research "suggests that sales fall
off a cliff," Henderson said.
Chrysler LLC requested $5 bil-
lioninnewloansontop ofthe$4bil-
lion it received in December. That's
$2 billion more than expected.
Both requests were part of
restructuring plans the two auto-
makers owed the government in
exchange for earlier loans.
Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner, who will lead an Obama
administration task force review-
ing the plans, said his team would
meet "later this week to analyze
the companies' plans and to
solicit the full range of input from
across the administration."
Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford,
which borrowed billions from
private sources before credit

make it through 2009 without
government help.
GM and Chrysler plan to
reduce the number of models
they offer. GM raised the possi-
bility its Saturn brand could be
phased out and said its Swedish-
based Saab unit could file bank-
ruptcy this month.
The restructuring plans must
be vetted by the Obama admin-
istration's new autos team.

New study abroad requirement unfair to some students
ach year, hundreds of University students travel all over
the world, taking advantage of one of the best learning
experiences the University offers: study abroad. But while
the option to study abroad provides a great opportunity, making
it a requirement is not such a good idea. Under a new policy, all
undergraduates in the School of Art & Design will be required to
study abroad during their college career. This may sound great
in theory, but concerns about the financial strain on already bur-
dened students makes it clear that this policy should be more
thoroughly reviewed before it is implemented.

W hen you think about sourc-
es of probing cultural
reflection, MTV is prob-
ably the last thing
that comes to mind.
But even though
"Music" Television
has degenerated 1
into shock-fests and
horrible reality gar-
bage, a recent pro-
gram gave me some
startling insights
into how pop cul- EILEEN
ture views mascu- STAHL
linity.
That show was
"Bromance", a
reality show starringrthe all-too-
appropriately-named Brody Jenner.
You may know Brody from his role on
"The Hills" (I didn't), and that stint
apparently made him rich enough for
cars, penthouses and a license to be a
total asshole. Despite his astronomi-
cal douchebagquotient, MTVtracked
down nine dudes desperate enough to
compete for his approval in a compe-
tition to find Brody's "new ultimate
bro."
Since we hadn't heard of a concept
that silly since someone claimed MSA
was relevant on the world stage, my
own bros andI were eager to watch the
program. But a layer of subtext piqued
my interest: In our homophobic soci-
ety, wouldn't a show about a bunch of
dudes attempting to secure the affec-
tions of another dude be "too gay"?
Well, apparently, MTV execs had
the same concern, because the cast of
"Bromance" goes to hilarious lengths
to assert its heterosexuality. Within
the first few episodes, the boys are sent
on a questto see who can bring the hot-
test woman to a lingerie party; they sit
around a campfire telling tales of their
sexual exploits; and a particularly cre-
ative bro constructs a miniature golf
course in which one hits a ball into
a cardboard woman's gaping mouth,
much to the raucous guffaws of all.As a
woman, I admit that I should have been

more offended than I actually was, but
for the most part I inexcusably chalked
it up to (dumb) boys being (dumb) boys.
However, what really rubbed me the
wrong way was the cast's treatment of
another contestant named Gary.
Gary was a dance instructor who
was constantly forced to explain how
"not gay" he was, even though he
seemed to me like the only normal guy
on the show. Nevertheless, the rest of
the cast incessantly ridiculed him for
such things as dancing (you know, his
job) and for talking about how much he
enjoyed the company of one particular
womanwhilst the other bros expressed
how much they enjoyed screwing mul-
tiple women with abandon (a lot, as it
happens). When Gary was at last"elim-
nated" from the show, hethought, like
I did, that his presence may have been
a mistake. "I don't belong here," he
said. "I'm not a jock." He was right -
he came off as a caring guy who is, or
should be, comfortable with himself as
a man.
Of course, "caring guy" and "jock"
don't have to be mutually exclusive,
and sometimes, "Bromance" doesn't
always portray it that way. The boys
share many emotional moments, shar-
ing their innermost feelings with each
other and crying about their families
on more than one occasion. While a bit
tacky to see on national television, this
is something I can get behind.
But it didn't make sense, then, that
they singled out Gary - especially as
there were some genuinely bromoerot-
ic moments on the program that made
his alleged transgressions seem about
as feminine as Bruce Willis driving a
stick-shift using only his pectoral mus-
cles. In the first episode alone, Brody
kidnapped the contestants from their
beds and assembled them in his liv-
ing room in various states of undress,
then hosted the first elimination round
in a rather cramped hot tub. Actually,
my friends and I began to suspect that
Brody was genuinely homosexual and
needed someone to talk to about his
feelings.

I wouldn't have batted an eyelash
at these incidents if it weren't for the
show's creepy misogyny and selective
homophobia. I haven't even mentioned
Mike, the show's only openly gay
character who appeared for a single
episode before "deciding" to leave. I
would have, too, as the poor guy was
ignorantly accused of trying to hit on
Brody at every turn. Here's an amaz-
ing fact for heterosexual males: just
as every woman doesn't nosedive into
your cock, you are not God's gift to gay
men, either.
Reality TV at its
worst: intolerance
and misogyny.
"Bromance" reveals society's dis-
comfort with the shifting concept
of masculinity. They hammered the
point home about how manly they
are in many offensive manners, then
include Mike to show that they're
"sensitive" - while leaving him open
to unacceptable ridicule. Gary, mean-
while, was the show's sacrificial lamb;
his presence allowed the boys to talk
about their feelings while maintaining
their manliness.
What "Bromance" - and arguably,
American culture - doesn't realize is
that the concept of what it means to
be masculine or feminine is constantly
shifting. A woman attending college
would have been unacceptably manly
as recently as 50 years ago, while in
some ancient cultures, homosexual
intercourse was a sign of mannish
virility. It's impossible to be 100-per-
cent manly, since the very idea of mas-
culinity is mostly socially constructed
- which is why in the end, I prefer men
who don'ttry so hard.

The University is one of the biggest par-
ticipators in study abroad among institutions
with graduate level programs, having the
sixth most travelers during the 2006-2007
school year. Of undergraduate programs, the
School of Art & Design has a strong rate of
participation. About half of this college's stu-
dents choose to go abroad during their time
at the University.
Butunderthe newpolicythe school added
last week, students won't be choosing to go
abroad - they'll be forced. Starting in the
fall semester of 2010, all undergraduates in
the School of Art.& Design will be required
to study abroad for at least three weeks to
graduate.
While studying abroad may be a relevant
and influential experience for students,
it also costs money. For many students,
attending the University is already a finan-
cial burden and studying abroad may not
be viable purely for financial reasons. By
instituting this policy, the School of Art
& Design is ignoring the circumstances
of students who can't afford the costs of
studying abroad.
The School of Art & Design seems con-
fident that in the majority of cases, stu-
dents' financial aid will carry over when
traveling. But it can't guarantee this in all
instances, and that's a problem. Though
there are scholarships that students can
apply for specifically dealing with study
abroad programs, applying for scholar-
ships takes time and isn't a sure thing. And
even ifa student is awarded a scholarship,

it may not be enough to cover the costs of
going overseas. Securing a way to pay for
such travels should have been the school's
priority well in advance of making study
abroad mandatory.
Luckily, the School of Art & Design rec-
ognizes the costs as an important issue for
students. According to Joe Trumpey, the
School's director of international engage-
ment, the School has fundraising goals
to improve financial aid for study abroad
programs. And an expected increase from
alumni donors to contribute to the financial
aid should help out students who don't have
the cash to pay for the trip on their own.
Aside from these cost issues, study
abroad just isn't a viable option for every
student. Other suitable excuses exist -
some students need to work to pay tuition,
for example. While such a group may be
in the minority, its existence means that
the School of Art & Design really needs to
rethink this policy.
it's certainly true that study abroad is
an enriching educational opportunity. The
School of Art & Design's high rateostu-
dents already taking advantage of this is
encouragingproof. Butby mandating study
abroad before explaining how all students
could afford it - and by ignoring the reali-
ties of certain students for whom study
abroad just isn't a good fit - the school
instituted a rash policy. The School of Art
& Design should take a closer look at this
policy, keeping in mind the financial situa-
tion of most students at the University.

Tuition, state money woes
aren't Granholm's fault
TO THE DAILY:
You are right, Patrick O'Mahen. The College
Democrats are an activist group on campus. Last
fall, we registered 4,667 voters and, previously,
we stood in solidarity with GEO as they fought
for a fair wage. Today, our members are working
across the policy spectrum to advance progres-
sive ideas on the state and national levels.
But you were wrong when you fundamen-
tally misrepresented the budgetary situation
and Governor Jennifer Granholm's advocacy
on behalf of University students in the state of
Michigan (Schooling Granholm, 02/16/09). Far-
cical analysis of the state budget fails to take in
account the extraordinary circumstances that
are facing this state as it weathers the current
economic conditions.
Granholm has been a steadfast proponent and
defender of state education funding since she
first stepped into office. Granholm is on record
as stating that with President Obama's stimulus
package, the proposed cuts will be unnecessary.
This goes for both K-12 education and higher
education spending. It also increases the Pell
Grant program to address the needs of low-in-
come students. Furthermore, Granholm's record
has consistently defended education spending.
Blaming Granholm for the hard decisions facing
this state is unfair.
The Republican Party has taken a strong
stance in both the state legislature and Congress

in favor of cutting spending across the board,
especially education. State Senate Majority Lead-
er Mike Bishop (R-Rochester) stated recently he
wanted cuts to education spending no matter
how much aid comes from the stimulus pack-
age. Granholm cannot expect willing partners
amongstate Republicans when they demand cuts
to higher education. Additionally, Republicans in
the U.S. Congress recently removed $40 billion
in aid to states. This was essential aid that would
have been used to fix these deficits in education
funding at the state level.
In these critical times, it is important to rec-
ognize that everyone is being forced to tighten
their belts. It is also important to recognize that
tuition is not the only issue critical to students.
Since the election, the College Democrats have
- focused on health care advocacy, prison reform
and sustainable growth in Michigan. Each one
of these campaigns addresses a significantly
ignored partof the budget that would immeasur-
ably improve the lives of students. Stereotyping
student concerns by focusing solely on tuition
minimizes our own pain and allows students to
be framed as extremely self-centered. These are
tough times for the entire state of Michigan, and
we are merely one constituency.
The College Democrats look forward to work-
ing with O'Mahen, MSA, LSA-SG and any other
interested organization on developing a forward
thinking action plan to address all issues affect-
ing students - not just tuition.

The letter-writer is the chair of the University of
Michigan chapter of College Democrats.

Two weeks ago, the Daily ran a
front-page story lauding the potential
benefits of Rackham Graduate School's
proposed continuous enrollment pol-
icy (Rackham dean pitches new enroll-
ment policy, 02/05/2009). This would
require all graduate students to enroll
and pay tuition for their entire program
of study even if they are researching or
writing their dissertation outside Ann
Arbor, activities that currently qualify
as tuition-free "detached study".
As noted in the resulting editorial
(Rackham's mistake, 02/11/2009), this
will increase enrollment by almost 30
percent while leaving funding levels
unchanged. Students currently paying
candidacy tuition will pay at a lower
rate, while those currently on tuition-
free detached study will pay approxi-
mately $6,000 per year to maintain
access to University resources. The
money freed up by lower rates will go
toward additional tuition fellowships
to be distributed by departments. The
books, we are told, will balance out.
So how could a proposal that is rev-
enue-neutral for the University pos-
sibly be bad? Graduate students don't
pay their own tuition anyway, so what
are they complaining about, right?
Rackham's publicity materials
emphasize how continuous enrollment
will give students full and uninter-
rupted access to University resources.
We question whether students con-
ducting field interviews in Central Asia
or writing a dissertation while living
elsewhere with a working spouse will
benefit from access to the University
gyms and University Health Services.
Students outside Ann Arbor simply do
not use the same amount of University
resources.
Rackham seems to believe that
once all graduate students are "prop-
erly enrolled," relationships with fac-
ulty mentors will improve drastically
because students will be able to say,
"We're paying for your time!" Butgood
mentoring relationships are built on
trust and reciprocity, not monetary
exchange.
As well as the dubious value to
students of a continuous enrollment
requirement, there are potential unin-
tended consequences. The Daily's
editorial could not have put the main
problem better: "The Rackham execu-
tive board is trying to streamline grad-
uate programs that demand flexibility."
Research takes unexpected turns and
personal lives continue during pro-
longed study. Sometimes, the single no-
questions-asked semester off under the
proposal just isn't enough to sort these
things out, and paying an extortionate
fee to re-enroll or re-apply only makes
it harder to return and complete.
Any barrierto cutting-edge research
damages graduate education, the Uni-
versity's reputation and, ultimately, the
quality of undergraduate education as
the best and brightest potential stu-
dents seek opportunities elsewhere.

Tackling a profound question and cre-
ating new knowledge by conducting
field research is already daunting with-
out having to obtain a fellowship to
cover tuition during an absence. Even
if, as Rackham Graduate School Dean
Janet Weiss says, there will be plenty
of fellowships to go around, and even
if we take on faith her word that only
students who bear the entire burden of
paying for their educations might end
up paying more (Student groups criti-
cize plan for a continuous enrollment
requirement, 02/11/2009),this proposal
creates a perverse incentive for depart-
ments to value quick completion over
cutting-edgeresearchandstudentbody
diversity. Excellence, and not churning
out carbon-copy Ph.D.s, is the point of
a major research institution.
So if the revenue effect is neutral,
why even have such a policy if gradu-
ate students will be financially unaf-
fected and there are potentially grave
consequences? We agree that gradu-
ate education at the University is not
perfect. Many of our colleagues do not
complete their degrees. But how many
of these could be "rescued" by continu-
ous enrollment versus how many will
be scared off from returning by the
administration? Why is Rackham only

now surveying students after the pro-
posal has been passed by its executive
board on which student representa-
tives have no vote?
In response to a letter containing
specific questions about the lack of
evidence in support of such a policy,
Rackham administrators sent back a
laundry list of initiatives underway
to improve graduate education at
the University. Then, in response to
the actual questions, they said, "We
believe that the continuous enroll-
ment policy is an important compan-
ion to these activities and will align
the provision of University services
and resources with program expecta-
tions for graduate students' work in
Ph.D. programs."
The University teaches us to exam-
ine arguments and evidence with a
critical mind and not to accept things
on the faith or belief of others - yet this
is exactly what Rackham wishes us to
do on this policy.

involved in the student response
to this proposal, please contact

"The International" is not - as
the trailer wants people to think -
purely an action film. Louis is no
Jason Bourne; he's just an above-
average police officer. Director
Tom Tykwer ("Run, Lola, Run")
wisely limits the action in the film
to a single sequence, amplifying
its intensity. Viewers will have
to wait patiently, but they will be
rewarded with a gorgeously cho-
reographed shootout that takes
place in New York's Guggenheim
Museum. The camera stays tight

shattering glass and screaming
civilians-.Blood spatters against-
the dizzying white spiral con-
struction of the museum. This
eye-popping battle is guaranteed
to linger in viewers' minds as one
of the greatest gunfights in recent
cinema.
"The International" is a well-
made movie. It reaches a per-
fect pace, neither confusing nor
exhausting audiences. The Guggen-
heim shootout itself is worth the
price of admission. Tykwer made
a hard decision to avoid watering
down the film with countless car
chases and explosions, but in doing
so, risked finding a wide audience.
Sadly, more people are likely going
to see "Street Fighter: The Legend
of Chun Li" than this movie. They'll
be missing out.

EP Review
Country-hopping pop
Beirut
March of the Zapotec/Holland
Ba Da Bing Records
Zach Condon, the mastermind behind Beirut, has
a habit of borrowing sounds from other cultures and
incorporating them into his own songs' DIY style. The
first Beirut album, Gulag Orkestar, featured a heavy
Eastern European influence, while the second, Fly-
ing Cup Club, had a more Parisian luster. March of the
Zapotec/Holland, Beirut's latest EP, maintains the cul-
ture-hopping trend with its distinct Mexican flavor.
Condon and his band recently took a trip to a small
village near Oaxaca, Mexico where they recorded a
good chunk of the EP, incorporating traditional Mexi-
can folk sounds into their own Balkan-tinged music.
While the first half of the EP contains these south-

of-the-border influences, the second half recalls Con-
don's early days as a solo musician with synth-poppy
electronic jams. As a whole, the EP is a pleasing fusion
of sounds from around the world that lives up to Con-
don's reputation for creating brilliant music.
Among the standout tracks is "The Concubine," fea-
turing a militaristic drum beat accompanied by a xylo-
phone and an unusually rhythmic accordion. Condon's
vocals soar softly above the music, creating a soothing
atmosphere.
"La Llorana" is the best effort from the opening
half. It's inspired by a tragic Mexican legend of the
same name about a young woman who commits sui-
cide. Condon captures this tragedy beautifully, backed
by a 19-piece band from the Oaxaca area that gives the
song an authentic, folky Mexican feel.
March of Zapotec/Holland succeeds by blending
traditional earthy sounds with the artificial beats and
harmonies of electronic instruments, continuing Bei-
rut's tradition of producing innovative tunes for fans
and casual listeners alike.
- RHIANNONHALLER

L.A. atmosphere has had a seri-
ous effect on the group's music.
"You know, in L.A. it's obvi-
ously sunny. The weather is
always great and the great sun-
shine and beaches. You know
that's sort of just our musical
language," Reyes said. "We try
to infuse that into our music
because I think a lot of people
aren't doing that anymore. The
last band that did that or kind of
made some conscious effort to

Illinois SenatorI ^Page1A

did try to raise
money for Gov

Burris explains he
tried, but did not
succeed in his
fundraising effort
SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP)- U.S.
Sen. Roland Burris now acknowl-
edges attempting to raise money
for ousted Gov. Rod Blagojevich
- an explosive twist in his evolv-
ing story on how he landed a cov-
eted Senate appointment from
the man accused of trying to sell
the seat.
Burris made the admission
to reporters late Monday, after
releasing an affidavit over the
weekend saying he had more con-
tact with Blagojevich advisers
about the Senate seat than he had
described under oath to the state
House panel that recommended
Blagojevich's impeachment. The
Democrat also said in the affida-
vit, but not before the panel, that
the governor's brother asked him
for fundraising help.
Though Burris insists he never
raisedmoneyforBlagojevichwhile
the governor was considering
whom to appoint to the seat Presi-
dent Barack Obama vacated, the
revelationthathehadattempted to
do so is likely to increase calls for
Burris' resignation and an investi-
gation into whether he committed
perjury before the panel.
Illinois Democrats havesent doc-
uments related to Burris' testimony
to a county prosecutor for review.
In Washington, agood-government
group recommended Burris' expul-
sion from the Senate if an ethics
committee investigation shows he

Palestinian conflict, Finkelstein
said that the United States is part-
ly culpable for the continuation of
diplomatic gridlock between the
two sides.
"It's clear that Israel can't do
anything without the United States
- that's transparent," he said.
Finkelstein also compared the
Palestinians in Gaza with prison-
ers in the Warsaw Ghetto of Nazi-
occupied Poland, saying that both
are "captive populations," that
have been "deprived of food, water,
medicine and other necessities."
In addition, Finkelstein argued
that the two sides have yet to
reach a peace agreement because
the Israelis have a vested interest
in keeping moderate Palestinians
out of the government, and do not
want to negotiate with the Pales-
tinians.
"Israel had a problem with
Hamas, it was getting too moder-
ate," he said, adding that it was a
goal of Israel to "keep hounding

liedto Senate leaders.
Burris, in the middle of a previ-
ously scheduled tour of northern
and central Illinois cities, would
not discuss his attempts to raise
funds for Blagojevich, but said
he didn't do anything wrong and
encouraged officials to look into
the matter.
"I welcome the opportunity to
go before any and all investigative
bodies ... to answer any questions
they have," he told reporters in
Peoria, before declining to answer
questions.
Burris, who declined to address
reporters again during a later
stop in Bloomington, also said he
planned to release later this week
"a concise document" related to
his testimony, but he would not
elaborate.
After an event Monday night
in Peoria, Burris told reporters
that he had reached out to friends
after Blagojevich's brother, Rob-
ert, called him before President
Barack Obama's election asking
him to raise $10,000 or $15,000 for
the governor.
"So sometime shortly after
Obama was elected, the brother
called and in the meantime I had
talked to some people about trying
to see if we could put a fundraiser
on," Burris said, according to an
audio clip provided by the Peoria
Journal-Star.
But Burris said his friends
weren't willing to contribute and
suggested that Robert Blagojevich
talk to Burris' partner about
approaching other potential
donors.
Burris reiterated that in the end,
he raised no money and hosted no
fundraiser.
Palestinians until moderate posi-
tions are untenable."
Theorizing that the Israeli gov-
ernment is more opposed to a two-
state solution than Palestinian
leaders in Hamas, Finkelstein said
that Israel hopes to subdue Hamas
to the point where it no longer
holds enough political clout to be
a negotiating partner.
School of Education senior
David Metler said the event would
have been more interesting with
a counterpoint to Finkelstein's
views on the region.
"It would have been nice to
have an opposing view presented,"
he said. "I liked how the heated
debate during the Q&A presented
some different opinions."
Nick Stery, a graduate student
at the University of Michigan-
Dearborn, said that he enjoyed the
lecture but didn't learn anything
new from it.
"He needs to reach out to a
broader audience with his infor-
mation. The people who attended
his speech tonight already know
the truth and agree with him,"
Stery said.

she said. "I feel like MSA just has
better things to do."
Bekkers disagreed with Londy,
saying it was important for MSA
to start the dialogue so that RHA
could take action.
"I think MSA works well enough
to have a big voice and also has the
possibility of working together
with RHA," he'said. "Someone had
to start the dialogue."
Student General Counsel
Michael Benson echoed Bekkers's
sentiment. He said it was important
for an assembly member to present
the issue to promote collaboration
with RHA.
"It's an issue that affects all of
our constituents," he said. "So now
we'll work collaboratively, as we
have in the past, with RHA to try
and find some sort of a solution."
Though he agreed with the ideas
put forth in the resolution, Benson
urged the assembly to take more
action rather than simply writing
letters.

belts, is $3,500 to $4,000. Other
costs include maintenance, storage
and insurance, which Annis has not
yet estimated.
Her plan is to bring a fleet of 10
pedicabs to Ann Arbor and adjust that
number after gauging popularity.
Though pedicabs operate the same
way as taxicabs and are primarily
owned by private companies, Annis
said she would like to see Ann Arbor
employ free pedicab service. That
would require the city to manage the
cabs and be funded by sponsorships.
The deadline for the last Ann
Arbor Community Foundation
grant proposal has already passed,
but Annis said she's still looking for
a sponsor.
Pete Hines,chairoftheWashtenaw

that hisgroup is in full support ofhav-
ing pedicabs as an alternative source
of transportation in Ann Arbor. He

organization, it wouldn't be able to

offer a sponsorship.
Annis also spoke with Nancy
Shore, the director of Ann Arbor's
getDowntown - a program that
focuses on finding sustainable
transportation options for the city's
commuting employees - about the
practicality of bringing pedicabs to
the city.
Shore liked the idea, but didn't
think it was feasible for such a
form of transportation due to win-
ter weather conditions and a small
population density.
"I'm very supportive of all types
of alternative transportation,
but I'm just weary of some issues
regarding our density here," Shore
said. "Right now I don't think that
pedicabs will work in Ann Arbor."
However, other Michigan cit-
ies - including Grand Rapids and
Detroit - have joined the trend.
Darin Galinis, owner and opera-
tor of Elite Pedicabs, became the
first pedicab operator in Michigan
when he opened his business with
co-owner Randy McCullough in
Lansing in 2007.
Shortly after opening in Lan-

sing, Galinis moved his business to
Grand Rapids so that he could be
closer to his family.
Currently Galinis operates four
pedicabs in Grand Rapids, but
is looking to at least double that
number and expand to other cities,
including Ann Arbor.
"We'd love to have our business
in Ann Arbor," he said. "It could be
in there in a matter of weeks."
Although Shore had concerns
about Ann Arbor's low population
density as a potential issue for sup-
porting a pedicab service, Galinis
said that the city's size is not a
major problem.
"If there's one thing I can say, as
long as you have any sort of night
life, size doesn't matter, you can
have pedicabs there," he said. "It's
just how many bikes you allow."
But even with the most expensive
ride settling at $5, a lack of custom-
ers forced Galinis to cut operation
in Grand Rapids from seven days a
week to Wednesday through Satur-
day from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m.
"At first it was our intention to
go every day of the week but we

found out that it was harder to get
started during the day than during
the night," he said. The nightlife is
more accepting of it."
In addition, Galinis acknowledged
the fact that weather during the win-
ter months can make for uncom-
fortable conditions outside, but that
business is just about as busy now as
it is during summer months.
"The one thing that definitely
stops us is the wind," he said. "It's
just unsafe."
Even last Friday - whentempera-
tures were near 22 degrees - Galin-
is said he made as much money as he
would have on an average summer
night with perfect weather.
And in regards to competition
with taxi cabs, Galinis said he
knows it's there, but thinks that
time will mend any ill feelings after
cab drivers realize that it's a give-
and-take relationship.
Although the pedicabs business
takes away some shorter rides from
taxicabs, Galinis said he also refers
longer distance rides to cab drivers.
"I think it just needs time," said
Galinis.

By GJON JUNCAJ
Daily Sports Writer
After winning 14 of its last 16
games, the No. 3 Michigan hockey
team has resoundingly put its dis-
appointing first half behind them.
Although the Wolverines have
seemingly resolved their consis-
tency issues, there isstill a question
that has gone unanswered:
Will Billy Sauer ever get any goal
support this season?
The senior goaltender rotated
with sophomorefBryan Hogan as the
starter in Michigan's first 16 games.
During that stretch, the Wolverines
scored 10 goals with Sauer in net
and 37 in front of Hogan. Despite
near identical goals-against averag-
es, saves made and save percentage,
Hogan became the full-time starter
in December.
Sauer, who set single-season
program records last year in goals-
against average and save per-
centage, routinely was a healthy
scratch.
Michigan coach Red Berenson
started Sauer in Saturday's 4-2 win
over Nebraska-Omaha, just the
second nod he's gotten this semes-
ter. Berenson has maintained that
he wants two goalies ready for the
postseason, and he said the coaches
had been planning to start Sauer so
he could become reacclimated to
game situations.
Berenson said Tuesday that
Sauer will "probably" play again at
some point in the final four games
of the regular season, but Beren-
son also said Hogan will still be the
starter Friday at Ohio State.
After Saturday's nightmarish
opening period in which the Mav-
ericks scored two power-play goals
30 seconds apart, Sauer kept the
Wolverines within striking dis-
tance all night.
He saved 28 of 30 shots that
night. In his last three games, dat-
ing back to Thanksgiving weekend,
Sauer has stopped 74 of 78 shots.
"Billy's last couple of games have
been phenomenal," sophomore
defenseman Scooter Vaughan said.
"He held us inthatgame (Saturday).
It could've gotten a lot worse in that
first period with all those 5-on-3s."
And the conference's top offense

finally gave its veteran goalten-
der some help. The Wolverines'
four goals marked the most scored
with Sauer in net since Halloween.
Michigan's 40 shots ots goal Satur-
day werc a season high with Sauer
as the starter.
"Yeah, it took awhile," Sauer
said. "I was like, 'Here we go again,'
in the second period. But these guys
did great and really came through
for me."
Entering Saturday, the Wolver-
ines had scored at least four goals
in 10 of their last 15 games. But in
Sauer's only start in those contests,
Michigan scored one goal.
Berenson said Saturday that
Sauer was probably wondering if lie
would ever be the benefactor of a
great offensive night again.
"That's a tough thing to try to
describe," senior forward Travis
Turnbull said. "It's not like we're
playing any different in front of
Billy. We have confidence in Billy's
ability to win games, and I think
we showed that (Saturday). I know
sometimes, you just can't put the
puck in the net."
A victim of odd circumstance
more than anything, Sauer has put
on a great face in public regarding
his bizarre season. He has jokingly
lamented his lack of offensive skill
after low-scoring games, and he
has been quick to praise Hogan,
who is in his first season as the
starting goalie.
Asked in December if he took

that sas the week of the Michi-
gan State series, when Hogan
became the full-time starter. But at
that point, the coaching staff hadn't
decided to stick with Hogan.
Two months (and two starts)
later, it's unclear when Sauer will
be in net again. As his collegiate
career winds down, Sauer isn't bit-
ter about his strange senior year.
"It's got to be tough for him,"
Turnbull said. "Butihe understands
that you've got to produce every
single night and that he has to wait
his turn sometimes. He's handled it
very well. I'm really proud of him.
He hasn't let anybody know that
he's upset or anything like that.
That's a great thing, especially for
the locker room."
When Hogan left in the third
period of Friday's 8-3 win due to ill-
ness, Sauer finished the final seven
minutes, stopping all four shots he
faced. At least 10 players skated
right to Sauer and congratulated
him before post-game handshakes.
After Saturday's stellar perfor-
mance, he was mobbed by team-
mates for his performance under
much more dire circumstances.
"Billy's a great kid and he's a
great teammate," Turnbull said.
"You can't be anything but happy
for him."

For more than thirty years my
father has been the proverbial kid

surrounded by chocolate seems
like more of a dream than a job.
But having been born into a sugar-

my siblings who hasn't been won
over by the chance to live in Candy
Land forever. I appreciate the sig-
nificance of having a part in such
a successful family business as
Lazar's Chocolate, but frankly, the
idea of carrying out this legacy is
less desirable than a root canal.
It is this common obsession with
chocolate, buttressed by commu-
nity support, which has kept my
father in business for over three
decades. Nearby stores constantly

of his transformation humorously

"It is complicated because a lot of
these things are rooted in biology,"
he said. "We really don't under-
stand it ... that even though we are
ruled by all these biological fac-
tors that doesn't mean that we are
just one thing or another because
everyone's biological factors are
wildly different."

But I could never identify with
the consumers' ongoing fascina-

to gain insight frit the daughter

When I used to work at Lazar's,
customers who I didn't know
seemed to know me simply by fam-

2007, it became one of 266 colleges
in the United States to include gen-
der identity and gender expression
in its non-discrimination clause,
according to the Transgender Law

But even with progressive poli-

Clinton should wear pantsuits, in a

whether or not they should wear

is an entire department devoted to

The discussion that transgender
students put forth is a continua-
tion of the greater gender dialogue,
but one of a different flavor. A dis-
cussion on how we can better ful-
fill gender stereotypes becomes
a discussion of how perceptions
of gender can better suit our indi-

their true sexual identity out of fear
of losing their jobs.
Charlie and Mak have both
experienced discrimination on the
Michigan campus. Mak has been
accosted on the street walking
home at night and last winter, he
was reproached for the bandages
he uses to make his chest appear
flatter when he went to the emer-
gency room of University Hospital
for minor injuries he received in a
car crash.
In the words of Javier, "there is
always more to be done" despite
all the policies the University has
adopted to accommodate transgen-
der students. There could be more
unisex bathrooms offered on cam-
pus, and the forms the University
requires students and employees

to fill out could include a blank
space after gender that would allow
people to fill out a true descrip-
tion of their gender expression if
it falls outside the male and female
dichotomy.
The University of Michigan Gay
and Lesbian Association offers two
$1,000 scholarships every year to
students who demonstrate a com-
mitment to gender and sexual
orientation on campus. But Mak
hopes to help establish the first
scholarship at the University spe-
cifically geared toward transgen-
der students.
When addressing a subject so
closely tied to our self-perceptions
and the perceptions others hold of
us, anger and misunderstandings
are common. Gender is an issue

rigorous training sessions as the
others.
After sneaking onto a blue bus,
we passed out candy to the riders
and thensauntered acrosstheDiag.
Luckily, we were able to infiltrate
several campus tours. One candy
recipient on her cell phone pro-
claimed "GOD, I love this school!"
while another commented, "I'm
glad there are people who like to
see other people happy." Reactions
like these are what drive the nin-
jas, they said.
"We love our school and doing
fun things on campus, and it's
just so great to see people's faces
light up after receiving candy and
a 'Happy Valentine's Day' from a
pink ninja," the ninja sensei said.
After passing through the Diag,
we visited the Union, hitting a
Dance Marathon event and pass-
ing out candy in the basement and
quiet study rooms. At times, ninjas
are so stealthy that students don't
notice their presence until they've
been attacked. Though it's not the
group's intention to frighten any-
one, students who might have been
deep into a study session will often
let out a quick scream before being
subdued by candy.

The next attack points were
the Law Quad, Law Library and
the new Ross School of Business.
When I passed out chocolate to a
table of four at the b-school, one
student asked for a kiss.
Our excursion, which lasted
slightly more than two hours, was
long and hot. I may have acciden-
tally revealed my identity several
times when I pulled down my
mask for air and water. I worried
that the other ninjas might want to
kick me out, but I don't think they
noticed - or at least they were kind
enough to forgive an amateur.
Other stops included the Gradu-
ate Library, the UGLi, South Quad,
the Fishbowl, Espresso Royale and
Borders Books. With only about
two pieces of candy remaining
per ninja at about 2:30 p.m., we
decided to infiltrate The Michigan
Daily office. When we arrived, the
newsroom was nearly empty - as
unlikely as it might seem, the staff-
ers must have been out on dates.
So having spread love and choc-
olate to our student peers in bulk,
we met one last time outside and
dispersed into thin air to clean our
extra-durable pillowcases.

An improbable bar crawl

Happy Hour at Whole Foods. Daiquiris at Quickie Burger.
How to make use of Ann Arbor's unlikely liquor licenses
By Roger Sauerhaft

After a busy day last week, I felt
like rewarding myself. I changed
into a button down shirt, put on
my favorite sweater, brushed my
teeth and splashed on a little extra
cologne. Then I met up with my
friend David and headed out for
guy's night out. Our destination:
Whole Foods Market.
It's little known that Whole
Foods on Eisenhower Parkway has
a by-the-drink liquor license, mean-
ing that the upscale grocery store
could operate a down-and-dirty
bar scene if it so chooses. Instead
of playing it safe and going to the
Heidelberg for Wednesday night
karaoke, my friend and I looked up
the list of local liquor licenses and
tried to catch a buzz at some of the
least likely watering holes in town.
Like any girl-chasing college
guy, my first thought when getting
a drink is what the female compa-
ny might be like. So upon entering
Whole Foods and being welcomed
by a perky female employee, I got
ready to spit my best game.
But in an upsetting turn of
events, the bar near the wine sec-
tion was completely abandoned
- we wouldn't be able to pick up
anything other than groceries at
this particular establishment.
"It's usually an older crowd look-
ingtotrynewwines,"saidbartende'r
Mike Byram, who handles an inven-
tory of over 1,000 types of wine. "A
lot of younger students come here
too who are interested in learning
about varieties of wine."
Byram said that while pickup
attempts or obviously drunk cus-
tomers at his bar aren't common,
he has witnessed both awkward
situations since the store opened
Sept. 24.
"One guy picked up a cheese
knife and said he'd pull an O.J.
(Simpson) on me," Byram said.
"Then he started thrusting the knife
at me - that's about the drunkest
I've ever seen here."
Toying with the chance to one-
up the Simpson protegee, I asked
if I could order a vodka cranberry
to start off. No dice, Byram said.
Due to the lack of regulation in the
liquor industry, Whole Foods can-
not determine what brands are up
to their ingredient standards and

therefore is liquor-free.
Fair enough. David and I ordered
pint-sized draughts of Bell's Best
Brown ale and Detroit Dwarf lager,
respectively. This time we were
served, as Whole Foods carries
nearly 200 varieties of beer, many
of which are from Michigan. With
our Whole Foods-standard brew
and open tabs, the night's festivities
had officially begun.
Byram (whose official title at the
store is Cheese Keeper) treated us
to a few delicious cheese samples
and chocolate truffles, which only
piqued our appetites and encour-
aged us to take our drinks on a
stroll around the store in search
of dinner. I settled on two spicy
salmon rolls from the sushi bar
and David picked up a grilled Por-
tobello mushroom concoction. Not
too shabby for bar food.
For those of you like me who get
separation anxiety leaving your
beer unattended, take solace in the
fact that Whole Foods understands.
I was free to roam the aisles while
savoringmy cold glass of beer.
"This totally changes the idea of
shopping in my mind," said David,
a 2007 University graduate. "I've
always viewed it as such a chore.
Now I can take my leisurely time
eating dinner and drinking a beer."

I could not agree more. Mom, if
you are reading this, I might just be
willing to go grocery shopping with
you if we can go to Whole Foods.
While perusing the aisles, I spot-
ted a girl from my history class.
Determined to be able to tell my
friends that I'd been so bold as to
buy a drink for a woman at Whole
Foods, I suavely asked LSA sopho-
more Annabelle Harless to come
have a drink with me.
Turns out, she was underage and
out with her twin sister and her
mom celebrating her birthday. She
introduced me to her family and
after chatting for a minute, I invited
her mom to try some wine after they
were done shopping.
Harless's mom, Deborah from
nearby Fowlerville, accepted my
offer and the whole family came
along. It was definitely a pleasant
surprise to hear that she found the
white wine better thanhouse whites
at mostrestaurants, and she said she
and her husband might make a date
of their next grocery trip.
Last call came just after 9:30
p.m., which kept me from reaching
the point when people sometimes
pull out cheese knives and imitate
O.J. Simpson. Looking for a place
with a better male-to-female ratio
to continue the night, we saw that

the Ann Arbor Women's City Club.
on Washtenaw Avenue was on the
city's liquor license list and decided
to check it out.
But sadly, we learned we couldn't
drink there unless we were mem-
bers. Frustrated and dejected, we
saw that Quickie Burger had been
granted a liquor license Dec. 17, so
off we headed to the corner of State
and Hill to finish the night in style.
Unlike the scenic walk from the
sliding glass doors to the shiny new
bar at Whole Foods, Quickie Burg-
er's bar was just one quick stride
from the door. The cheery owner,
Varujan Arman, placed a Bud Light
draught in my hand a couple min-
utes later before I headed down-
stairs to watch the Duke vs. North
Carolina basketball game on the big
screen TV in the basement.
I thought I might be forgotten
downstairs if I needed another
drink, but the wait staff kept a good
eye on everything, regularly com-
ing down and asking if customers
needed anything.

Arman, a 2006 University alum,
clearly knows how to apply the
knowledge he picked up while
earning a psychology degree to his
business plan.
"Summertime, you grab a burger
and have a beer, what's better than
that?" Arman said. "Beer and burg-
er, it's a natural fit."
It seems alot of customers are on
the same page. Every few minutes
the door would swing open and the
later it got, the more partygoers
trudged in to take advantage of the
2:30 a.m. closing time during the
week. (Quickie Burger closes at 4
a.m. Thursday through Saturday.)
There are twelve beers on tap,
ranging from Blue Moon and Stella
Artois to Bud Light and Pabst Blue
Ribbon.
The burger definitely hit the
spot for me. So did the Jager-bomb
dispensed by a special machine. I
could have also chosen to go with a
rum and Coke, strawberry daiquiri
or a Longisland iced tea. There was
also the blue lemonade, Quickie
Burger's equivalent to the shark
bowl at Rick's.
"I would drink it anytime, to be
honest,"Arman said ofthe blue lem-
onade. "It's one of those drinks that
tastes like candy. You can't taste the
alcohol, then you drink like four..."
You get the point.
After an exhausting night of vis-
iting everyday places and violating
social norms, I had learned, ate and
drank a lot. I had also been laughed
at or yelled at for calling businesses
with liquor licenses to ask if I could
come in for a drink.
My favorite response came from
Champion's Party Store on South
Forest Avenue. Because they sell
beer and have a laundromat at
the back of the store, I asked if I
could purchase alcohol and drink
it while I did laundry. The cashier,
angry and dumbstruck, denied my
request. Perhaps. you can find a
better way to ask, and if you do, let
me know.

ably know where this is going.
"Doyou realizethere's adifference
between those two numbers," the
customer sardonically asks. A silence
ensues, and the employee responds,
"Uhh, no." The quibbling continues,
with the employee maintaining that
his math is correct. After the cus-
tomer insists that 0.002 dollars and
0.002 cents are completely different
figures, the employee transfers him
to another representative.
The manager, Andrea, picks up the
phone, and the debate continues. The
customer tries to give the manager a
lesson in math, but she still doesn't
get it. "I don't know. I'm not a math-
ematician," she says. "It's obviously a
difference in opinion."

THEME PARTY SUGGESTION
Spring break bust - So you totally balked on
spring break plans and now it's too late. Your
dreams of a lewd weeklong bash in Cancun are
crushed. You'll probably end up at home, watch-
ing "Oprah" with your mom. She'll think you're sick
when you sleep past 3 p.m. every day, but you won't
bother to correct her. Instead, you'll pass out in front
of the TV every night with Cheetos in your mouth.
After midterms, that might be just what you need.
Throwing this party? Let us know. TheStatement@umich.edu
STUDY OF THE WEEK
Men who smoke cannabis more likely to get cancer
Men who smoke cannabis on a regular basis significantly increase
their risk of testicular cancer, according to a study recently published
in the journal Cancer by researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center in Seattle, Wash.
In the study, the researchers questioned 369 men with testicular can-
cer about their past cannabis use. Then, they compared their findings
with responses from 979 men who did not have cancer.
The researchers concluded that men who smoke cannabis regularly
increase their risk of testicular cancer by 70 percent, regardless of their
family history, alcohol use and cigarette habits. The risk is most acute for
those who smoke cannabis at least once a week or who started smoking
during adolescence. These men are twice as likely to contract testicular
cancer than those who have never smoked, the study found.
The form of testicular cancer that can result from smoking cannabis
is nonseminoma, which is intense and usually afflicts younger men.
