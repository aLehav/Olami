RICH RODRIGUEZ PROFILE
Rodriguez,
despite past
woes, keeps
sights ahead

Michigan quarterback Denard Robinson celebrates with the student section at the Big House after the Wolverines bested UConn 30-10. In his first start Saturday,
Robinson electrified the crowd, posting 383 yards and scoring two touchdowns.
It's OK to get excited @00 for now

On Saturday, sophomore quar-
terback Denard Robinson was
unbelievable.
Michigan coach Rich Rodri-
guez said
afterward
that the game
has finally
slowed down
for Robinson.
But that's not
quite right.
It's more
like the rest of NICOLE
the Wolver- AUERBACH
ines and their
opponents
were playing at normal speed.
Press fast-forward, and that's
when you see Robinson.
Robinson posted 383 total

yards - more than Connecti-
cut's entire team - and scored
two touchdowns at the Huskies'
expense in his first career start.
He proved a few things:
- The quarterback competition
is over. (Maybe it was over after
Robinson's first pass this spring?)
- He's no longer one-dimen-
sional. His 19 completed passes
eclipsed his total from last season
(14).
- Rodriguez finally found his
guy to fit his system. Let the Pat
White at West Virginia compari-
sons begin - they certainly did
during postgame interviews.
Saturday's game was a must-
win for Michigan, rare to find in
a week-one matchup. For the first
time in the Rodriguez Era, the

Wolverines not only got the 'W,'
they did it in a completely domi-
nating fashion against a talented
team. Perhaps more important,
they did it with a quarterback
who, despite making his first
start, already exhibits the poise
and patience of a veteran.
It's just one game, and Notre
Dame awaits this week, but it's
OK to get excited about a quar-
terback who doesn't tie his shoe-
laces.
The most terrifying moment of
the game came late in the third
quarter. Robinson, naturally, had
taken off for a 15-yard burst up
the middle of the field. The play
ended with Connecticut crunch-
ing his hip. He stayed down for a
few moments before walking off

the field under his own power.
Of course, he'd get up. Of
course, he would come back to
start the fourth quarter.
"He's such a resilient player,"
sophomore linebacker Craig Roh
said after the game. "He's always
going to get back up."
But will he always? Should
Michigan fans worry?
Robinson had 29 (!!!) rush
attempts against Connecticut.
Michigan's top two running
backs, Michael Shaw and Vincent
Smith, had exactly 29 combined

In exclusive interview,
coach bluntly talks
NCAA probe, his
troubled tenure and
off-field distractions
By JACOB SMILOVITZ
Editor in Chief
"Everyday I get up, everyday I
go to bed thinking about what I
can do to make this the best pro-
gram in America," a visibly emo-
tional Rich Rodriguez said in his
Schembechler Hall office during
a 30-minute interview with The
Michigan Daily last week, hands
striking the table for emphasis.
The coach became slightly agi-
tated when the conversation turned
to his job security. This is his third
year, the critics have said, if he
doesn't win this year, he should be
gone. Before he was leaning back,
relaxed, free-wielding. Now he sits
upright, chooses his words with
a pause, hands driving his points
home.
He cuts himself off here, pauses
there.
"That's all I think about," he cor-
rects himself, "that's all we think
about. So the rest of it is drama - I

don't need to deal with it."
Since he arrived at Michigan
more than two years ago, there's
been a lot of talk about Rodri-
guez: He's not Ann Arbor enough.
He doesn't fit in here. His offense
doesn't belong in the Big Ten. The
criticism has come from all angles
and in all shades of displeasure.
And there's no denying that
some of that criticism has been
well-founded : as Rodriguez has
been stuck in a swirl of troubles
from an NCAA investigation into
his program to winning just three
Big Ten games in his first two years
at Michigan.
But after two turbulent years
as Michigan's head football coach
and an offseason full of speculation
and "make-or-break season" dic-
tums, Rodriguez is eager to move
forward. He got his first chance to
do that on Saturday, abating some
of the most immediate calls for his
firing with the team's impressive
30-10 rout of Connecticut at the Big
House.
As the season approached last

Riots not in the plans

Though Campus Day tour
guides may tell incoming
freshmen and their parents
colorful stories about how
the Fleming Administration
Building was built to be riot
proof, history books tell a dif-
ferent - and more accurate .-
story.
Opened in August 1968,
the Fleming Administratioo
Building replaced what is now
the LSA Building as the office
of the University's top admin-
istrators and officials. And
while protests on campus have
a history of targeting some
of the University's top lead-
ers, including the University's
ninth president Robben Flem-
ing, for whom the building is
named, the building was not
built to be "riot proof."
Both the timeline for the
building's construction and

the building's blueprints and
design plans indicate that
there are other reasons for the
building's eye-catching fagade.
Although the University's
most notable protests began in
the late 1960s, with the Flem-
ing building bid out in 1966
and completed in 1969, the
building's design was actually
conceptualized in the early
1960s long before the campus
protests.
But for many, the build-
log's design, with its unique-
ly-placed, primarily long and
narrow windows, still suggests
that the building's designer
may have planned to make the
building as secure as possible.
However, in the plans he
presented to the University's
Board of Regents, architect
Alden B. Dow, famous for his
cutting-edge designs, intended

to meet specifications of Uni-
versity leaders while preserv-
log the aesthetic appeal for
which he was known.
to a 2007 interview with
The Michigan Daily, Julia
Truettner, then a campus
planning project manager, said
the rumors about the build-
log's riot-proof design greatly
offended Dow, who designed
the building in his signature
"composed order" design style.
Treuttner said the narrow
window design was also meant
to make the building more
energy efficient than its pre-
decessor - the LSA Admin-
istration Building, which has
large windows that overheated
the then-non-air conditioned
building in the summer and
left the building drafty during
cold winters.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT, Mich.
Granholm leads her
last Labor Day run
Gov. Jennifer Granholm says her
five-mile Labor Day run across the
Mackinac Bridge could be a meta-
phor for Michigan's past, present
and future.
The state's outgoing Democratic
leader was among 300 runners who
led several thousand walkers yes-
terday across the span linking the
Upper and Lower peninsulas.
In a telephone interview with
The Associated Press, Granholm
" said the run started under clouds,
with rain during the crossing, and a
burst of sunshine at the finish line.
The 51-year-old Canadian-born
mother of three is an avid runner
and was accompanied by husband
Dan Mulhern, daughter Cecelia
and two cousins.
Granholm described the experi-
ence as "magnificent."
In her eighth and final year as
governor, Granholm acknowledged
the state has been through the
toughest economic period since the
Great Depression.
"Time magazine called it the
decade from hell," she said. While
the magazine used the phrase to
describe the nation as a whole, Gra-
nholm said, it's "certainly" been
'hell in Michigan.
Michigan's seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate stood at 13.1
percent in July, well above the
national rate of 9.5 percent.
Hopeful signs, she said, are that
automakers are finally doing some
hiring and that Michigan is struc-
turally better positioned now.

takes hostages

Iranian woman's death
sentence sparks outcry

End of Ramadan
causes international
fear for woman's life
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - The
lawyer for an Iranian woman sen-
tenced to be stoned on an adultery
conviction said yesterday that he
and her children are worried the
delayed execution could be car-
ried out soon with the end of a
moratorium on death sentences
for the Muslim holy month of
Ramadan.
In an unusual turn in the case,
the lawyer also confirmed that
Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani
was lashed 99 times last week in
a separate punishment meted out
because a British newspaper ran
a picture of an unveiled woman
mistakenly identified as her.
Under Iran's clerical rule, women
must cover their hair in public.
The newspaper later apologized
for the error.
With the end of Ramadan this
week, the mother of two could be
executed "any moment," said her
lawyer, Javid Houtan Kian.
The sentence was put on hold
in July after an international
outcry over the brutality of the
punishment, and it is now being
reviewed by Iran's supreme court.
Ashtiani was convicted in 2006
of having an "illicit relationship"
with two men after the murder
of her husband the year before

and was sentenced at that time
to 99 lashes. Later that year, she
was also convicted of adultery
and sentenced to be stoned, even
though she retracted a confes-
sion that she says was made under
duress.
"The possibility of stoning still
exists, any moment," Kian told
The Associated Press. "Her ston-
ing sentence was only delayed; it
has not been lifted yet."
Italy is among several coun-
tries pressing for Iran to show
flexibility in the case. The coun-
try's foreign minister, Franco
Frattini, said the Italian ambas-
sador in Iran met with authori-
ties in Tehran who "confirmed
to us that no decision has been
made" about the stoning sen-
tence.
"I interpret that in the sense
that the stoning, for now, won't
take place," Frattini said in an
interview on Italian state TV.
After putting the stoning sen-
tence on hold, Iran suddenly
announced that the woman had
also been brought to trial and
convicted of playing a role in her
husband's 2005 murder. Her law-
yer disputes that, saying no charg-
es against her in the killing have
ever been part of her case file.
In early August, Iranian
authorities broadcast a pur-
ported confession from Ashtiani
on state-run television. In it, a
woman identified as Ashtiani
admits to being an unwitting

accomplice in her husband's kill-
ing.
Kian says he believes she was
tortured into confessing.
In the latest twist, authorities
are said to have flogged her for the
publication of a photo of a woman
without her hair covered in the
Times of London newspaper. The
woman in the photo was misiden-
tified as Ashtiani.
She was lashed on Thursday,
Kian said, citing information
from a fellow prisoner who was
released last week. Kian has been
allowed no direct contact with his
client since last month.
"We have no access to Ashtiani,
but there is no reason for the
released prisoner to lie" about the
flogging, he said.
There was no official Iranian
confirmation of the new punish-
ment.
The woman's son, 22-year-old
Sajjad Qaderzadeh, said he did
not know whether the new lash-
ing sentence had been carried out
yet, but that he also heard about
the sentence from a prisoner who
recently left the Tabriz prison
where his mother is being held.
"Publishing the photo provid-
ed a judge an excuse to sentence
my poor mother to 99 lashes on
the charge of taking a picture
unveiled," Qaderzadeh told the
AP.
The Times apologized in its
Monday edition but added that the
lashing "is simply a pretext."

Man seeking mental
help begins short
standoff in Georgia
military hospital
SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) - A for-
mer Army soldier seeking help
for mental problems at a Georgia
military hospital took three work-
ers hostage at gunpoint yesterday
before authorities persuaded him
to surrender.
No one was hurt and no shots
were fired in the short standoff at
Winn Army Community Hospital
on Fort Stewart, about 40 miles
southwest of Savannah, said fort
spokesman Kevin Larson. Mili-
tary officials said the hostages
were able to calm the gunman and
keep him away from patients until
he surrendered.
Military police arrested the
gunman, who was being ques-
tioned yesterday afternoon.
His name was not immediately
released.
Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Phillips, a
senior Fort Stewart commander,
said the former soldier was seek-
ing help for mental problems that
were "connected, I'm quite cer-
tain, to his past service."
"He hadn't gotten the care that
he wanted and he wanted it now,"
Phillips said, based on what one of
the hostages had told him. "He'd
had some experiences that could
lead one to believe there were
aftereffects to his service."
Both he and Larson declined to
be more specific, citing the active
investigation.
The suspect walked into the
hospital's emergency room at
about 4 a.m. carrying two hand-
guns, a semiautomatic rifle and a
semiautomatic version of a sub-
machine gun, Phillips said. He

took a medic hostage and headed
to the building's behavioral treat-
ment wing on the third floor.
An Army psychiatric nurse
spotted the gunman and
approached him to talk, Phillips
said. That nurse was then taken
hostage along with a behavioral
health technician who refused
to allow the gunman through a
locked door to the patient area.
Still, the nurse - an Army
major - was able to start calming
the man.
"Working together, they main-
tained the situation, kept the gun-.
man out of the territory where
he could harm someone else and
bought time for someone else to
get there," Phillips said.
Military police soon arrived
and surrounded the hospital.
Army investigators trained in
hostage negotiations worked their
way to the floor.
In less than two hours, they
persuaded him to put down his
weapons and surrender.
Because the suspect is a civil-
ian and the standoff involved hos-
tages on a federal installation, the
FBI was called in to help with the
investigation.
It was unclear Monday what
charges the man would face.
Fort Stewart, the largest Army
post east of the Mississippi River,
is home to the 3rd Infantry Divi-
sion. Most of the division's 19,000
soldiers are deployed to Iraq. It's
the 3rd Infantry's fourth tour in
Iraq since the war began in 2003.
Phillips said he'd seen nothing
to indicate the former soldier had
previously sought treatment at the
Fort Stewart hospital.
"He broke the law, obviously,
and he threatened people" and
would have to face the conse-
quences, Larson said. "But we
are going to get him the help for
behavioral health."

Gubernatorial races may
foreshadow 2012 election

Democratic and
Republican parties
seek wins for races
in 37 states
WASHINGTON (AP) - Never
before have so many governor-
ships been up for grabs - and with
so much at stake.
The races come just ahead of
once-in-a-decade congressional
and legislative redistricting to
reflect the U.S. population of the
2010 census, a process in which
governors will play a central role.
Of the 37 governorships on the
ballot, more than half are open
seats. And many of the contests
are in prime 2012 presidential bat-
tleground states.
Democrats control 26 gover-
norships and must defend 19 in
November. Sheer math, the sour
economy and historical trends
favoring the out-of-power party
in midterm elections suggest big
Republican statehouse gains.
"We are now tasked with
remaking the political map,"
proclaims the website of the
Republican Governors Associa-
tion, headed by Mississippi Gov.
Haley Barbour, a potential presi-

dential candidate.
Republicans are hoping for
eight or more pickups. "We can't
wait until 2012 to start taking our
country back," says Barbour.
Democrats are striving to mini-
mize losses and pull off some
upsets.
"We knew it was going to be
a tough year just by virtue of the
fact that we elected a Democrat
to the White House in 2008," said
Nathan Daschle, executive direc-
tor of the Democratic Governors
Association. "History shows the
president's party loses 5.5 gover-
nors seats in midterm elections."
Furthermore,the poor economy
and growing tea-party activism
are weighing on all incumbents
and those perceived as establish-
ment candidates.
"In a year like this, no one is
safe," Daschle said.
Underscoring the high stakes:
The GOP governors association is
poised to spend up to $65 million
on the races; its Democratic coun-
terpart, about $50 million.
Republicans' best shot for pick-
ups may be a string of governor-
ships now held by Democrats
across Great Lakes and upper Mid-
western states, including Ohio,
Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois and
Iowa as well as Pennsylvania.

Democrats have fewer oppor-
tunities for gains, although they
appear on track to pick up Repub-
lican governorships in Hawaii,
Connecticut and possibly Minne-
sota.
Both parties were pumping
resources into high-profile cam-
paigns in populous California,
Texas and Florida, all won by
Republicans four years ago. Dem-
ocrats hope to add at least one of
those big three to their column.
These have been particularly
tryingtimes for governors.
On the front line of the econom-
ic crisis, many have been forced
to cut services or raise taxes - or
both. And they've been bloodied
by voter anger and the tea party
movement sweeping the nation.
Unlike the federal government,
governors can't print money and
many are barred from deficit
spending.
That, along with term limits in
some states, is why so few sitting
governors are running. Only 13
incumbents are on the ballot.
And some standing for re-
election are in close races,
including Democratic Govs.
Chet Culver in Iowa, Ted Strick-
land in Ohio, Martin O'Malley in
Maryland, even Deval Patrick in
Massachusetts.

Colorado wildfire
threatens ho-mes

More than 400
homes evacuated as
wildfire approaches
DENVER (AP) - A wind-
driven wildfire broke out in the
rugged Colorado foothills and
quickly spread across 4 square
miles yesterday, destroying some
homes and triggering evacua-
tions of as many as 400 others.
No injuries were reported.
Authorities could not say how
many structures burned down,
but they said at least some of
them were houses.
The fire started in Four Mile
Canyon northwest of Boulder,
and erratic winds gusting to 45
mph spread the flames both to
the west and northeast.
At least four roads in the area
were closed, and a billowing,
white plume of heavy smoke was
visible for miles. The cause was
unknown.
"It's fast-moving. We've got
a lot of wind up there," Boul-
der County sheriff's Cmdr. Rick
Brough said. He said emergency
crews were concentrating on
evacuations.
About 200 homes scattered in
and near the canyon were evacu-
ated earlier in the day. Brough
said residents of two other sub-
divisions closer to Boulder, each
with about 100 homes, were
ordered to evacuate yesterday

afternoon.
At least 100 buildings were
threatened.
One fire vehicle was destroyed,
said Patrick von Keyserling, a
spokesman for the Boulder Coun-
ty Office of Emergency Manage-
ment.
At least two heavy air tankers
were sent to the Rocky Mountain
Metropolitan Airport southeast
of Boulder to help, but the winds
were too strong for them to fly
over the fire.
"They just can't get up until
the wind dies down," Brough
said.
The strong winds accompa-
nied a cold front moving across
the state. They weren't expect-
ed to slacken until last night,
said Scott Entrekin, a National
Weather Service meteorologist.
About 100 ground crews were
on the scene and 75 more were on
standby, Brough said.
"It was tremendously dark
about an hour ago," said Mari-
lyn Cole, who was working at the
Country Corner Store in Hygiene,
about 10 miles northeast of the
fire. "It's very, extremely hazy."
Three evacuation centers
were set up in Boulder and in
the mountain village of Neder-
land, and at least 65 people had
checked in at the three centers by
mid-afternoon.
A shelter for livestock was set
up at the Boulder County Fair-
grouys in Longmont.

being created as fast as they need to.

Couch ban overlooks real problems

Unsigned editorials reflect the official position of the Daily's editorial board. All other signed articles
and illustrations represent solely the views of their authors.
Stop the vote
A2 City Council should delay vote on couch ban
tudents often ignore city politics. But the City Council's first
September meeting tonight shouldn't fly under students'
radar. After discussion during the summer, a vote on a pro-
posed ordinance to ban couches on porches has been scheduled for
tonight. Because students haven't been around en masse to raise
their objections, all sides of the issue haven't been given equal atten-
tion. City Council simply hasn't made any effort to give students a
chance to express their opinion on an ordinance that will primarily
affect them. City Council should delay voting on the ordinance until
students have a chance to voice their opinions.

The proposed ordinance to ban uphol-
stered furniture on porches was first intro-
duced to City Council in 2004 by the Ann
Arbor Fire Department. AAFD held that
porch couches were a fire hazard. Over the
years, City Council has reintroduced the
proposal several times, but it has always
been tabled indefinitely before it could
make it to a vote. In April, there were sev-
eral suspicious fires around the campus
area - one of which may have been started
with a porch couch and led to the death of
an' Eastern Michigan University student,
reinforcing the fire department's original
claims. The fires prompted City Council to
revisit the proposal.
The Daily reported in August that the vote
wouldn't take place until the Council's sec-
ond September meeting later in the month.
But according to Councilman Christopher
Taylor (D-Ward 3), the vote will actually
take place tonight - just a few days after'
most students arrived in Ann Arbor. And
students have been so busy settling in and
preparing for the beginning of the semes-
ter that they likely haven't been able to get
caught up on the City Council's recent activ-
ity. Because there isn't any student represen-
tation on City Council, students' opinions
haven't gotten any exposure.
The timing of the vote makes it seem that

City Council is trying to pass the ordinance
before students can express their views.
Many city residents support the ban -
when it was first introduced, many thought
porch couches were an eyesore, according
to Daily editorials from 2004 and 2005. But
absent students haven't been able to raise
their concerns about a ban that doesn't
address the core problem. The real con-
cern should be unsafe student houses that
aren't up to code and don't have proper fire
escapes and tenants who haven't been edu-
cated on fire safety. A blanket couch ban
won't solve that problem.
Since this ordinance will almost exclu-
sively affect students, it's unacceptable
that City Council hasn't given students
a chance to lobby for their interests. City
Council should wait until students are
established and have a chance to voice
objections before it holds a vote on such a
contentious proposal.
The relationships between the city, resi-
dents, students and the University have
always been tense. But there's no reason
for City Council to strong-arm an ordi-
nance into existence without consulting the
students that it will primarily affect. City
Council should delay the vote on the ordi-
nance until council members can hear both
sides of the debate.

As many remember from last year, disaster struck 928
State Street in April when an off-campus house caught fire,
leading to the unfortunate passing of one of its residents -
Renden LeMasters, a 22-year-old Eastern Michigan Univer-
sity student. Months after this tragic event, our thoughts
and condolences are still with the LeMasters family during
what certainly remains a difficult timein their lives. As both
a college campus and a part of the Ann Arbor community,
we must now reflect upon how to best prevent a similar trag-
edyfrom recurringin the nearfuture.
The Ann Arbor City Council has proposed an ordi-
nance change to the Ann Arbor City Code, which prohib-
its the "storage of furniture not intended or designed for
outdoor use on exterior balconies, porches, decks, land-
ings, or other areas exposed to the weather." The Coun-
cil's reasoning behind this potential ban derives from the
fact that furniture intended for indoor use is oftentimes
more flammable than its outdoor counterparts, and thus
can perpetuate a fire. When discussing a matter as critical
as student safety, however, it is essential that focus solely
remains on the well-being of the students and not drift
to other debates - like the aesthetics of the city - which
have often arisen within the non-student community
over this issue. With this in mind, we hope to convey to
City Council that the proposed'couch ban' - to which the
ordinance is regularly referred - is assuredly not the best
action to take to improve fire safety.
As the chair and vice-chair of the Michigan Student
Assembly Campus Safety Commission, it is our role to
provide the student body with safety information relating
to all areas of University life. In light of last spring's fires,
we looked into fire safety regulations for both on- and off-
campus housing, and we were startled by the relative void
of protocol and procedures within off-campus homes.
With such a large and varied network of landlords
and homeowners, safety regulations and suggestions
are at times erratically maintained in off-campus hous-
ing, as home inspections are currently mandated only
once every 30 months by the city. Additionally, there is
no active, city-regulated community of landlords and ten-
ants to encourage and ensure that fire safety and personal
security are maintained in student homes, thus bringing
about increasingly unsafe residences. Therefore, the best
way to combat safety-ignorance at the student level is for

the city to collaborate with the University to implement a
series of standards and provide resources regarding fire
safety to all students. By simply banning sofas on front
porches, City Council is, in effect, combating against stu-
dents instead of working with them to promote genuine
safety awareness.
Further, while it can't be denied that keeping indoor
furniture outside puts residents at risk in the case of a
fire, there are many other risks that are equally - if not
more - crucial to ensuring the safety of a home. Setting
up a grill, leaving out bags of garbage, owning whicker or
wood furniture, and disposing of cigarette butts on front
porches are hazardous behaviors that can cause or accel-
erate a fire, yet these practices would not be addressed
under the new ordinance. Also, smoke detectors in off-
campus homes are irregularly monitored and are some-
times intentionally tampered with, but these life-saving
devices are not included in any increased regulations.
Perhaps most notably, some off-campus homes do not
include emergency or alternative exits, and - as was the
case in last April's fire - the only way out remains the
front-porch entrance. Again, at least as of now, nothing
looks to be in the works to resolve this matter.
While well intentioned, we see the proposed outdoor
couch ban as merely a knee-jerk reaction to a much big-
ger issue. If this ordinance is passed, it is our fear that
the community-at-large will think that great measures
have been taken to improve student safety, yet in real-
ity, little will have actually been accomplished. On Sept.
21 at 4:30 p.m. in MSA Chambers, we will be hosting a
Campus Neighbors meeting to bring together off-and-on-
campus residents in order to improve communication and
share pertinent safety information, and we hope that City
Council will join us in this effort. Instead of requiring by
law that students adhere to one specific faction-of safety
advice (when so many more exist), City Council should
be willing and excited to step up, reach out and create
meaningful, widespread change. They should work with
the student body, discover its needs and collaborate with
the University to make an actual difference - instead of
banning couches and calling ita day.

CHRISTOPHER TAYLOR v
Couch ban protects students

This is the 120th year that The Michigan
Daily is publishing an edition on the first day
of classes at the University. Over the course of
those years, we've learned a lot about this job
and it's done everyday in an effort to serve you,
the campus community.
Part of our job is informing students about
campus and city issues that will affect their
lives - see our coverage of the proposed couch
ban today for an example. Part of it is not as
focused on students' lives, like some of our Uni-
versity administration coverage that is meant
to allow faculty and instructors to be better-
informed employees. We spend a lot of time
trying to get things right. Some days we do this
well. Some days, admittedly, we do not.
But the Daily isn't some distant, abstract
entity that we keep locked away at the top of
an ivory tower. It's an active, adaptive publica-
tion that takes input and information from all
corners of campus and distills it just enough to
produce a new rendering each morning. If you
feel like your corner of campus isn't getting its
share of that coverage, you have the power to
change that. This editor's note is meant to be
a short primer on that - a guide to reading the
Daily and engaging with it.
Can you really print whatever you want?
Yes. We are completely separate from the
University. The administration does not have
any oversight over the editorial content of the
newspaper. This is possible because the Daily is
entirely financially supported by advertisements.
When we send the pages to the printer at the end
of each night, just a handful of students are left in
an otherwise dark building at 2:30 a.m. There are
some professionals in the building during the day
who help manage the Daily's finances and advise
the Daily's business staff, but they have no say in
what appears in the paper.
With that independence comes a great deal
of responsibility. We do our best to handle that
delicately. We work each day to publish stories
that inform and entertain and that help you to
live smarter, more exciting lives. Like I said, we
do this better some days than others.
How does a reader get in touch with you?
There's this new thing called the Internet
and it is really something special. Have a story
that needs our attention? Think we're notscov-
ering your slice of campus well enough?
Let us know about it.
We sort through tons of information here at
the Daily. Sometimes we miss things, sometimes
we mess things up. When we do either of those
things, please, please, please let us know. If you
have a newstip, e-mail news@michigandaily.com
and it will be delivered to the personal inboxes of
six news editors and me. If you want to yell at me
personally - or just kindly suggest something
that we should cover - feel free to shoot me an

e-mail at smilovitz@michigandaily.com.
Also, make sure to call us out when you see
something wrong. If you spot a factual error
in a story, e-mail corrections@michigandaily.
com and let us know. We won't be offended. We
want the information that we're publishing to
be correct.
How can a studentjoin the paper?
Think we're running the paper into the
ground? Feel free to come join us and turn it
around, or further run it into the ground -
whatever your preference is. The Daily always
welcomes new writers, reporters, photogra-
phers and designers - no matter your level of
journalism experience. To let us know about
your interest, head to michigandaily.com/
recruits and fill out the webform. We'll get in
touch with you soon thereafter.
Another option would be to attend one of our
mass meetings, which will be occurring this
semester at 7 p.m. on the following days:
Sunday, Sept. 12
Tuesday, Sept. 14
Thursday, Sept.16
Monday, Sept. 20
Thursday, Sept. 30
How can a reader express their opinions
in the paper?
On this opinion page, we print content from
the campus community everyday. There are
three ways to get published:
Send a letter to the editor by e-mailing
tothedaily@umich.edu.
Submit a viewpoint by sending it to our
editorial page editor Rachel Van Gilder at van-
gilder@michigandaily.com. Viewpoints are
usually 500-700 words long and are edited only
for grammar and Daily style.
Join the Daily's editorial board to debate
issues that students face and help determine
the paper's official position on these issues.
Contact Rachel Van Gilder at vangilder@mich-
igandaily.com for more information about the
editorial board.
I sincerely hope that you take these opportu-
nities to engage with the Daily this year. A lot
happens on this campus, and the more of it that
appears in these pages, the better off the entire
community is.
Jacob Smilovitz
Editor in Chief

After a month-long process, the Ann Arbor City Coun-
cil will consider whether or not to pass an ordinance
to ban porch couches tonight. This vote was originally
scheduled for the middle of August, but City Council pur-
posefully delayed the vote to ensure that students would
have the opportunity to weigh in on and learn about a
measure that is important to them.
The goal of the porch couch ban ordinance is to reduce
the risk of exterior fires and to thereby create a safer
environment for residents and our housing stock. The
ordinance achieves this goal by prohibiting the outdoor
storage of upholstered furniture designed for indoor use.
This prohibition furthers our goal of reducing risk to per-
sons and property not because couches are inherently
dangerous, but because they are a large source of fuel for
fires. Storing large flammable objects on porches is inher-
ently dangerous.
So why is a piece of furniture that is safe indoors haz-
ardous when stored out doors?
Fire requires fuel, oxygen and heat to burn. These
three elements, plus time, allow a fire to grow. Indoors,
a couch is benign because the oxygen element is limited
and there is greater likelihood of detection - via smoke
alarms, fire alarms, occupants and/or fire suppression
systems. Outdoors, a couch is a latent hazard because the
oxygen element is unlimited and detection depends upon
bystander observation. Based on this information from
fire safety experts it is irrefutable that a porch couch is at
least a theoretical hazard. It is therefore reasonable to ask
whether it is a hazard in the real world.
It is.
According to records provided by Ann Arbor Fire Mar-
shal Kathleen Chamberlain, since 2000, there have been
three indoor fires in the city of Ann Arbor the origin of
which has been attributed to upholstered furniture. Over
that same period, there have been 93 outdoor fires in
Ann Arbor that are attributable to upholstered furniture.

Porch couch fires are not some minor risk that prompts
a knee-jerk, nanny-state solution. They are a real-world
problem that requires action.
Couch porch fires in Ann Arbor have resulted in mil-
lions of dollars in damages, many injuries and, tragically,
one fatality. As most of you :know, there was a house fire
in April on State Street and a man died. He was a student
much like you. His name was Renden Lemasters. The
exact circumstances of this fire are still under investi-
gation, but there are some certainties: The massive fire
started on the porch and there was a couch on the porch.
I was once a student here at the University. I know that
many of a student's best memories and strongest relation-
ships are forged with friends, idling away the hours on a
porch couch, talking politics, relationships, sports, class-
es, etc. I know that these times are an important part of
the college experience.
This proposed ordinance will not change any of that.
What it will do is ensure that tenants, occupants, man-
agement companies and property owners all are required
to keep upholstered indoor furniture indoors.
So pool your resources, hit up your parents, find some
outdoor furniture, then sit on your porch and enjoy your-
selves. Be a college student and live and learn. We are
delighted that you are here and hope that you enjoy your
time in Ann Arbor - in fact, we hope you'll decide to stay
after graduation. But whether you are here for a semes-
ter or, like me, decide to make Ann Arbor your home, it is
our obligation on Council to ensure that everyone in the
city is safe from reasonably preventable and non-obvious
hazards. That's why I hope that Ann Arbor will join cities
such as Kalamazoo, Boulder, Madison, West Fayette and,
yes, Columbus, in taking this moderate step to prevent
unnecessary and tragic loss, injury and death.
Christopher Taylor is a City Council
member representing the Third Ward.

carries.
It's a scary high number for
a running back - let alone the
new face of the Wolverines.
After the game, neither Rodri-
guez nor Robinson realized how
many attempts the 6-foot-3, 193-
pound sophomore had taken.
"If he can carry it 29 times
for 200 yards, he'll carry it 29
times," Rodriguez said, smiling.
"It is a long season and we play
a lot of physical teams. But he's
a very strong individual. He can
handle it."
If Robinson were to carry
the ball 29 times a game for
the rest of the season, he'd end
up with 348 rushing attempts
on the year - a new Michigan
rushing record. At the moment,
Chris Perry's 338 attempts in
2003 hold the record, and even
workhorse Mike Hart's heavi-
est season (2006) was just 318
attempts.
And for comparison's sake,
former quarterback Chad Henne
rushed 180 times over four years
at Michigan.
Robinson won't get 29 carries
a game, especially after he inev-
itably tallies a few more jarring
hits in September. (Rodriguez
admitted it was a bit higher than
he'd anticipated, though most
plays were planned runs.) That's
COUCH BAN

resolution.
"We're disappointed that City
Council never reached out to the
University community to really
collaborate on this issue," Ray-
mond said.
Raymond added that though the
assembly supports fire prevention
measures, they are disappointed
that the council considered the
ordinance over the summer and
did not attempt to get students
involved in the process.
"When the City Council tries to
impose itself on these issues with-
out talking to all parties involved,
then you run into problems of
communication," he said.
Though Taylor said he didn't
think City Council targeted stu-
dent groups for input on the
ordinance, he argued that such a
_ measure was not necessary.
WESTIN

graduated in 1974, but continued
to study at the University, enroll-
ing in the Law School.
After graduating from the Law
School in 1977, Westin served as a
law clerk to J. Edward Lumbard of
the United States Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit and later for
Supreme Court Justice Lewis F.
Powell.
In 1991, Westin accepted a
position as general counsel at
Capital Cities/ABC. He eventu-
ally became president of produc-
tion, and in 1997, with almost no
experience in television journal-
ism prior to his counsel position,
he became the president of ABC
News.
Westin is in charge of "World

News Tonight," "Nightline,"
"Good Morning America,"
"20/20," "This Week with Chris-
tiane Amanpour" and "World
News Now." He is the longest
serving network news division
president, responsible for multiple
Emmy and Peabody awards and
has made crucial decisions guid-
ing the network through many
changes including the search for a

the risk a team like Michigan
takes with the spread offense,
and that's why teams don't
normally run quarterbacks like
running backs.
Yes, Robinson is resilient.
But him running so much isn't
necessary. Michigan has a nice
supply of young running backs
who can carry more of the load
while letting Robinson dazzle as
a dual-threat quarterback.
Robinson is really fun to
watch - from the press box,
stands or even the field.
"You'll be blocking, and two
seconds later, you look up and
see Denard 20 yards upfield,"
said center David Molk. "There's
nothing better than that."
He's fun for the Michigan
defense to watch from the side-
lines, too, because for the first
time since fall camp ended, they
aren't the ones trying to catch
him.
Connecticut got a taste of
that, and its coach had a mes-
sage for the 11 teams remaining
on the Wolverines' schedule.
"Denard Robinson is going
to make people look bad," Con-
necticut coach Randy Edsall
said.
If he's healthy, I can't wait to
watch.

"It is an ordinance which ...
is not exclusively related to stu-
dents," Taylor said.
Taylor added that public con-
versations about the ordinance
have been happening as far back
as last April, when a local resident
urged City Council to consider
banning upholstered porch fur-
niture in light of the on-campus
blaze.
Despite opposing the ordi-
nance, Raymond said the assem-
bly is prepared to work with City
Council to discuss more compre-
hensive fire prevention measures
in the future.
City Council took up a simi-
lar resolution in April 2004 that
would have banned upholstered
furniture on porches, noting that
it could impede residents' ability
to get out of the house in case of
a fire.
In August 2004, City Council
postponed the resolution indefi-
nitely.
news anchor to replace Peter Jen-
nings on "World News Tonight" in
2005.
The search for Jennings'
replacement was a turbulent peri-
od in Westin's career, with "World
News Tonight" going through
four anchor changes in a five year
period.
Fellow 'U' alum Bob Woodruff
- who got his J.D. in 1987 - co-
anchored the show with Elizabeth
Vargas for four months before
Woodruff resigned after suffer-
ing serious injuries while report-
ing in Iraq, and Vargas resigned
shortly thereafter. Westin select-
ed Charles Gibson as lead anchor,
and he served for three years
before retiring, leading Westin to
fill the position with then-"Good
Morning America" co-anchor
Diane Sawyer.
Though he navigated the net-
work through rough waters, some

speculate that his struggles dur-
ing a tough time for the news
business could have influenced
his decision to leave. In the past
few years, ABC News has cut staff
by 25 percent and according to a
report in the Times, there is spec-
ulation that Disney executives
were unhappy with ABC News's
financial performance.

From Page1A
week, Rodriguez sat down with
the Daily to go on the record about
the situation he now finds himself
in. He bluntly discussed the past,
admitting his early recognition
of looming on- and off-the-field
problems and also saying that the
NCAA's investigation of his pro-
gram is "embarrassing." At the
same time, the coach jumped at any
opportunity to discuss the future
and signaled his steadfast belief
that he will turn the program.
THE CRITICS AND
HIS TENURE
The interview offered a glimpse
of the unvarnished Rich Rodri-
guez, not the caricature collaged
from press conference sound bites
and newspaper clippings. But the
Rich Rodriguez who admits his
regrets from the past two years and
gets emotional during talk of his
tenure as Michigan's head coach.
At times light-hearted and at times
sternly serious, Rodriguez was
brash, off-the-cuff, a ball coach -
but a ball coach who was willing to
reflect, analyze, introspect.
He discussed his frustration
with what he called "misinforma-
tion" and "misperceptions" about
him and his program.
"It's almost been an avalanche
of things that maybe have caused
a certain wave of discontent that
maybe didn't have to be there,"
Rodriguez said.
While some were caught off
guard by the team's struggles on
and off the field these past two
years, the coach himself was not.
on the field, Rodriguez under-
stood the challenges the team faced
in getting the right talent to fit his
system from early on.
Asked if he was surprised that
the program isn't further along as
season three gets underway, the
coach said, "in some respects I am,
and in some respects after the first
spring, I'm not."
"I mean I knew after the first
spring it was going to take a little
longer to do what we wanted to do.
So I didn't have a particular, I didn't
come in with a particular window
of say it's going to happen by this
year, or that year. I just expected it
to happen - and hopefully sooner
rather than later."
off the field, Rodriguez points
to his controversial departure from
West Virginia as the seed of the dis-
content he's faced in Ann Arbor.
"It all started when I left West
Virginia and there was a big back-
lash from back home about that
and I didn't talk publicly, talk to
the media before I left," he said. "I
wish, looking back, I wish, I prob-
ably should've done that."
Rodriguez said he opted not
speak on advice from legal counsel,
as he was in the midst of a lawsuit
with West Virginia and several
complications regarding the buy-
out from his contract there.
"Looking back I should've,
I should've said this is the rea-
sons why we're leaving, this is my
thoughts about that place," he said.
"And I think there was so much
misinformation that got it all start-
ed in a wrong fashion."
What surprised Rodriguez
though is just how long complica-
tions from those initial problems
have lingered.
"I thought that would dissi-
pate after a few months, it didn't.
It lasted a year and a half - and it

may still be going on," he said with
a chuckle.
Much of the criticism of Rodri-
guez from within circles in Ann
Arbor is that the coach isn't Ann

Arbor enough, he's not of the fabled
Michigan Man lineage. The criti-
cisms are part elitist condescen-
sion, part collegiate jingoism. He's
from West Virginia and he didn't
earn his stripes in the Michigan
system, critics have said. The first
charge is also true of Fielding Yost,
the second is true of Bo Schem-
bechler.
In the interview, Rodriguez
rebuffed that talk, but said he
understood it - at least in part.
"No, I think that comes with
the job," he said when asked if the
criticism surprised him at all. "You
know when you're not winning,
there's skepticism and doubt. And
when you are, there's less of it."
But Rodriguez did say that he
finds some of the criticism of him
so far off-base that it's laughable
- especially those claims that he
doesn't fit in here.
"As far as like the traditions of
Michigan and all that, I studied
it a little bit," he said. "Some of it,
I didn't have to study, you already
knew about it, you knew about the
Ohio State game, you knew about
Bo Schembechler, you knew about
those things.
"So you know, this mispercep-
tion that this new guy was coming
in and trying to change all the tra-
ditions was silly," he continued. "I
mean it really is just kind of comi-
cal to look and think thatsomebody
would think that."
NCAA INVESTIGATIONS
While he couldn't discuss details
of the NCAA's investigation into
his program for violating rules
regarding offseason workouts and
practice times, Rodriguez did talk
about the impact the investigation
has had on his program and him
personally.
Asked if he was embarrassed by
the investigation, the coach said
yes.
"Oh yeah, I mean sure. Anytime
you get 27 years of coaching and
never have any issues at all and all
of a sudden you have this and your
program has to go through that
type of thing, it's embarrassing to
deal with it," he said.
Rodriguez did note however
that, in his mind, the wrongdo-
ing the NCAA ultimately found
through its investigation was far
different from the initial accusa-
tions published in the Detroit Free
Press last August that prompted
the investigation.
In its notice of allegations, the
NCAA reported discovering five
violations including that the team
exceeded the number of coaches

it can have working with student-
athletes and that it had coaches
monitoring football players in vol-
untary, offseason workouts and
conditioning, which is against
NCAA policy.
The Free Press reported in
August of last year that the team
"consistently has violated NCAA
rules governing offseason work-
outs, in-season demands on players
and mandatory summer activities
under coach Rich Rodriguez."
Rodriguez said in the interview
that the Free Press's allegations
and the NCAA's findings weren't
the same.
"I think we tried to explain our-
selves both from an institutional
standpoint and from me and the
staff as well as we could, try to tell
everybody what was really going
on," Rodriguez said, "...what pre-
empted the investigation in that
article in the Free Press and what
came out later was really two dif-
ferent things."
Rodriguez also expressed his
frustration with what he deemed
"a perfect storm of miscommunica-
tion ina whole lot of areas" that led
to the investigation.
"The thing that bothered me
the most was that everything that
happened through the investiga-
tion or because of it, we could've
fixed in literally hours or minutes
had we just communicated better,"
he said.
The only NCAA charge that
Michigan is fighting is the claim
that Rodriguez "failed to promote
an atmosphere of compliance with-
in the football program" and didn't
sufficiently monitor the activities
of his program with regard to the
other allegations.
Asked if that claim in particular
is tougher to swallow as it has his
name on it, Rodriguez nodded.
"Sure," he said. "I think any-
time you have your name on any-
thing like that it's just something
that you ... have a hard time deal-
ing with, so that's one reason why
we made our case, but we'll see
what happens."
Michigan is still awaiting final
word from the NCAA after com-
pleting its hearing in Seattle in late
August.
LOOKING FORWARD
Rodriguez isn't a big fan of
dwelling on the past.
Several times in the interview
the coach made reference to put-
ting these past couple years behind
the program and focusing on
what's ahead.
"You know I really haven't

looked back too much to reflect
because I don't - other than to
look back and learn - I don't know
how much good it would do as far
as going forward," he said at one
point.
"I think you have to look back
and learn, which we've all done,"
he said. "But I think you just try
to focus on doing what you've got
to do to build the best program in
America and I still believe we've
made strides to that end."
He said he doesn't think the last
two years were for naught, they
were part of a learningcurve - just
one far steeper than anyone, espe-
cially Rodriguez, had hoped.
"I don't think the last two years
have been wasted in any stretch,
I think there's a lot of things that
we've tried to do in the program
that will help us set up for the
future," he said. "I just, I know
everybody hopes it happens right
now and so do I."
During the interview last Mon-
day, Rodriguez said the much-
anticipated season opener against
Connecticut on Saturday wasn't
even in the forefront of his mind.
"We're always worried about
what's next," he said, "and for us
it's not even, right now it's not even
Saturday, it's today, it's Monday's
practice, what we got to do today
and once today's over, what we got
to do tomorrow."
Though in the interview Rodri-
guez addressed off-field issues like
the NCAA investigation and his
reputation, he prefers to talk foot-
ball - his program, his players, his
coaches. The resthe'llleaveforoth-
ers to talk about.
"Most coaches like to talk foot-
ball, talk about their preparations
for the games and their opponents
and all that as opposed to, you
know there's way too much talk
about other stuff - I mean that's
society today," he said.
"It's more exciting to talk about
the other stuff I guess, I don't
know," he said with a pause. "Not
to me."
The off-the-field problems have
weighed on him, it's clear. But he
says they haven't affected the job
he's done.
"There's been a few more
obstacles, things to overcome,"
he admits, "but I don't think it's
wavered our approach."
Asked if there's any doubt in his
mind that he can turn the program
around, Rodriguez responded
quickly.
"No, none whatsoever."

Petraeus: Images of burning Quran bad
for U.S. cause in Iraq and Afghanistan

General responds to
threat to burn copies
of Muslim holy book
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP)
- The top U.S. and NATO com-
mander in Afghanistan warned
Tuesdaythat anAmerican church's
threatto burn copies of the Muslim
holy book the Quran could endan-
ger U.S. troops in the country and
Americans worldwide.
"Images of the burning of a
Quran would undoubtedly be used
by extremists in Afghanistan -
and around the world - to inflame
public opinion and incite violence,"
Gen. David Petraeus said in an
e-mail to The Associated Press.

His comments followed a protest
Monday by hundreds of Afghans
over the plans by Gainesville, Flor-
ida-based Dove World Outreach
Center - an evangelical Christian
church that espouses anti-Islam
philosophy - to burn copies of the
Quran on church grounds to mark
the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks
in the United States that provoked
the Afghan war.
Muslims consider the Quran to
be the word of God and insist that it
be treated with the utmost respect,
along with any printed material
containing its verses or the name of
Allah or the Prophet Muhammad.
Any intentional damage or show of
disrespect to the Quran is deeply
offensive.
In 2005, 15 people died and

scores were wounded in riots in
Afghanistan sparked by a story in
Newsweek magazine alleging that
interrogators at the U.S. detention
center in Guantanamo Bay placed
copies of the Quran in washrooms
and had flushed one down the toilet
to get inmates to talk. Newsweek
later retracted the story.
At Monday's protest, several
hundred Afghans rallied outside
a Kabul mosque, burning Ameri-
can flags and an effigy of Dove
World's pastor and chanting
"death to America." Members of
the crowd briefly pelted a pass-
ing U.S. military convoy with
stones, but were ordered to stop
by rally organizers.
Two days earlier, thousands of
Indonesian Muslims had rallied

outside the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta
and infive other cities to protestthe
church's plans.
Petraeus warned images of
burning Qurans could be used to
incite anti-American sentiments
similar to the pictures of prisoner
abuse at Iraq's Abu Graib (ah-booh
GRABE) prison.
"I am very concerned by the
potential repercussions of the pos-
sible (Quran) burning. Even the
rumor that it might take place has
sparked demonstrations such as the
one that took place in Kabul yester-
day," Petraeus said in his message.
"Were the actual burning to take
place, the safety of our soldiers and
civilians would be put in jeopardy
and accomplishment of the mission
would be made more difficult."

'U' administrators encourage
freshmen to expand horizons n

Thursday's New
Student Convocation
was themed 'Widen
Your Worldview'
By DAVID BUCCILLI
For the Daily
New students from across the
country and around the world
shone in specks of maize and
blue throughout Crisler Arena
on Thursday night as University
administrators and student lead-
ers welcomed the class of 2014
to the University at New Student
Convocation.
This year's ceremony was
themed "Widen Your Worldview,"
which served as the keystone

underlying each speaker's address
to the freshmen class.
The University's new provost,
Philip Hanlon, who's now two
months into the position, wel-
comed students and their families
and expressed his high expecta-
tions forthe class of 2014.
"As Michigan students you
can achieve and we expect you to
achieve great things. Go for it,"
Hanlon said.
Michigan Student Assem-
bly President Chris Armstrong
encouraged students to open up
to themselves and others by being
true to who they really are.
"Your time here in Ann Arbor is
as much about your own self-dis-
covery as it is about your career,"
Armstrong said.
Ted Spencer, associate vice pro-
vost and executive director of the

University's Office of Undergrad-
uate Admissions, spoke next about
the importance of diversity and
the magnitude that comes with
being a Wolverine.
"You will join students from
over 1,900 different high schools,
all 50 states and almost 70 coun-
tries, giving you the opportunity
to widen your worldview with
classes from many diverse back-
grounds," Spencer said.
"And after graduation you will
become part of the largest net-
work of alums in the world," he
continued.
With a record number of more
than 32,000 applicants for this
year's clas$, the University's
incoming freshmen had a mean
grade point average of 3.8, Spen-
cer said. And 13 percent of the new
class earned a perfect 4.0 GPA, he

said.
In her remarks, University
President Mary Sue Coleman
echoed with Armstrong's senti-
ment in regards to self-growth,
and also continued the theme of
the evening by speaking about
widening one's perceptions of
people and the world.
"College is about ideas, view-
points, and questions - and the
myriad directions they take your
mind," Coleman said.
Some students like LSA fresh-
man Emily Martin left the cer-
emony feeling more confident
about starting their first year at
the University than before they
entered Crisler Arena.
"Coming to Michigan, you're
scared and anxious," Martin said.
"It was comforting to hear all
these kind words."

Mich. Supreme Court knocks 'Tea Party'off ballot

Party didn't meet
technical rules in
the state law
LANSING, Mich. (AP) - A
shadowy group calling itself "The
Tea Party" won't be allowed on
the state's November ballot after
a Friday order from the Michigan
Supreme Court.
The high court's 5-2 vote

lets stand a ruling earlier this
week from the Michigan Court
of Appeals that keeps "The Tea
Party" off the ballot because it
didn't comply with some techni-
cal requirements in state law.
Republicans and tea party
activists consider "The Tea
Party" a Democrat-supported
fake aimed at siphoning away
votes from conservative candi-
dates. The effort has connec-
tions to a former Oakland County

Democratic Party official.
The appeals court ruled earlier
this week "The Tea Party" could
not be on the ballot because of an
irregularity on its petitions cir-
culated to make the ballot. The
word "the" in "The Tea Party"
title was not in 24-point bold face
type on its petitions as required
by law.
The Supreme Court denied
a request to appeal, with the
majority saying it was "not per-


suaded that the questions pre-
sented should be reviewed" by
the court.
"Today's decision by the Court
is a win for all of the dedicated
grassroots activists who are part
of the true Tea Party movement
and it is a win for democracy,"
Michigan Republican Party
Chairman Ron Weiser said in a
statement.
Messages were left seeking
message comment after Friday's
ruling with "The Tea Party"
chairman Mark Steffek and
attorney Michael Hodge.
The court battle started
last month after the Board of
State Canvassers deadlocked
2-2 on a proposal that would
have placed "The Tea Party"
on the ballot. The tie vote,
with Republicans opposing
the measure to put the group
on the ballot and Democrats
supporting it, meant "The
Tea Party" was not certified
for the Nov. 2 ballot.
"The Tea Party" was seek-
ing to run nearly two dozen
candidates including nomi-
nees for attorney general,
secretary of state, two of
Michigan's 15 congressional
districts, six of 38 seats in
the state Senate and eight of
110 seats in the state House.
The group also listed poten-
tial candidates for the Uni-
versity of Michigan Board of
Regents, the State Board of
Education and the Oakland
County Board of Commis-
sioners.
Two of the state Senate
candidates wouldn't have
qualified to make the ballot
because they are too young.

Republicans
respond, skeptical of
short-term relief
MILWAUKEE, Wisc. (AP) -
A combative President Barack
Obama rolled out a long-term
jobs program Monday that would
exceed $50 billion to rebuild
roads, railways and runways, and
coupled it with a blunt campaign-
season assault on Republicans for
causing Americans' hard econom-
ic times.
GOP leaders instantly assailed
Obama's proposal as an ineffective
one that would simply raise already
excessive federal spending. Many
congressional Democrats are
also likely to be reluctant to boost
expenditures and increase federal
deficits just weeks before elections
that will determine control of Con-
gress.
Jim Manley, spokesman for Sen-
ate Majority Leader Harry Reid of
Nevada, cautioned, "If we are going
to get anything done, Republi-
can cooperation, which has been
all but non-existent recently,
will be necessary."
That left the plan with low, if
not impossible, odds of becom-
ing law this year. When Con-
gress returns from summer
recess in mid-September, it is
likely to remain in session for
onlyafewweeksbefore lawnak-
ers return home to campaign for
re-election.
Administration officials said
that even if Congress quickly
approved the program, it would
not produce jobs until sometime
next year. That means the pro-
posal's only pre-election impact
may be a political one as the
White House tries to demon-
strate to voters that it is working
to boost the economy and create
jobs.
At a Labor Day speech in Mil-
waukee, Obama said Republi-
cans are betting that between
now and the Nov. 2 elections,
Americans will forget the
Republican economic policies
that led to the recession. He said
Republicans have opposed vir-
tually everything he has done to
help the economy, and have pro-
posed solutions that have only

made the problem worse.
"That philosophy didn't work
out so well for middle-class fami-
lies all across America," Obama
told a cheering crowd at a labor
gathering. "It didn't work out so
well for our country. All it did was
rack up record deficits and result in
the worst economic crisis since the
Great Depression."
He said Repubicans have consis-
tently opposed his economic pro-
posals and seem to be running on
a slogan of "No, we can't," playing
off his 2008 presidential campaign
mantra of "Yes we can."
"If I said fish live in the sea,
they'd sayno," Obama said.
Republicans made clear that
Obama should not expect any help
from them.
Senate Republican Leader Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky said the
plan "should be met with justifi-
able skepticism." He said it would
raise taxes while Americans are
"still looking for the 'shovel-ready'
jobs they were promised more than
a year ago" in the $814 billion eco-
nomic stimulus measure.
The House Republican lead-
er, John Boehner of Ohio, added
"We don't need more government
'stimulus' spending. We need to
end Washington Democrats' out-
of-control spending spree, stop
their tax hikes, and create jobs by
eliminating the job-killing uncer-
tainty that is hampering our small
businesses."
Administration officials are
hunting broadly for ways to revive
the economy. But they are likely to
drop a separate proposal to renew
a law exempting companies from
paying Social Security taxes on
anyunemployed workers they hire,
according to a White House official
who spoke on condition of ano-
nymity because the decision was
not final.
Casual in brown slacks and
open-collar white shirt with
rolled-up sleeves, Obama took a
populist tack in his speech, mixing
attacks on Republicans with praise
for working-class and middle-class
Americans.
He said he'd "keep fighting,
every single day, every single hour,
every single minute to turn this
economy around." He said interest
groups he has battled "talk about
me like a dog."

TV channels: gotta
watch 'em all

niversity life is meant
to broaden our hori-
zons, open our eyes to
things we've never seen and
provide us with opportuni-
ties abroad. College is where
we define
Q who we are
and what we
will become.
Everyone
says now,
is the time
to try new
things: take
a class just CAROLYN

sounds fun,
smoke some
weed and backpack through
Europe. We've heard it all, but
I'm going to recommend anoth-
er type of horizon broadening,
and you don't even have to leave
your couch. I urge you to make
the most of your college years
by watching TV, and lots of it.
Here's the thing: I had a
fortunate childhood. I had no
fewer than 5 channels for as
long as I can remember. Cable
and satellite allowed me to grow
up in front of the TV. I loved
me some PBS as a small child;
eventually, I graduated into
Nickelodeon, Disney Channel
and Cartoon Network, which I
held onto for an embarrassingly
long time. My preteen years
were ushered in by ABC Fam-
ily and the WB and as I entered
high school, I discovered the
pop culture thrills of MTV, VHS
and Comedy Central. While my
television tastes evolved across
many networks, I still never
regularly watched more than
six or seven channels at a given
time in my life. That is, until
college.
When everyone told me to try
new things, I took the mantra to
heart with my remote in hand. I
did a little channel surfing and

Sweeney Todd is no match for the Demon Beard of Robert Duvall.
Buried in boredom

Even screen legend Duvall can't
save this misshapen dramedy
By JENNIFER XU
Daily Arts Writer
With its vague title, the only thing saving the
Depression-era "Get Low" from a complete theater
walkout is the inimitable Robert
Duvall ("Godfather"), and even he
seems to be phoning it in.
The film opens on an unidentified Get Low
panting man against a silhouetted
house with flames licking furiously , At the Michigan
at its framework. A jump cut then and Rave
quickly and jarringly reveals Felix Sony
Bush (Duvall), a backwoods hermit
who has isolated himself to 40 years
of solitude. Bush comes into town with a wad of cash

and a plan to organize his own funeral in order to "get
low," a euphemism for dying, and brings the entire
town to whispers about his murky past.
The rest of the superstar cast features Sissy Spacek
("Carrie") as Bush's former love interest and Bill Mur-
ray ("Lost in Translation") as the humorous, morally
ambiguous funeral director. Unfortunately, the two
aren't given much to do other than parade around in
their period clothes, throwing off pithy one-liners to
the best of their abilities.
The role of ornery, mysterious old man with a heart
of gold is not a new one for Duvall, who has filled out
his repertoire with typecasts in "We Own the Night,"
"Crazy Heart" and "Secondhand Lions." The only
difference is that this time he has to carry the movie
all by himself Duvall manages to grow slowly more
endearing to the townspeople, but never any less enig-
matic, effectively enshrouding the central plot twist in
enough mystery to pull the audience somewhat will-
ingly through the rest of the film. It's an affecting yet

Basement Arts
kicks off year
with Mamet play

You say "Bob Hope Humanitarian Award." Clooney says "Target practice."

Clooney doing Clooney in
lopsided The American'

By BRAD SANDERS
Daily Arts Writer
Basement Arts is wasting no time
starting off its fall season. Ina small
collaborative theater project this
summer, three School of Music, The-
atre & Dance under-
grads discovered the A .t
nuances of "A Life ALife i the
in the Theatre," a Theatre
David Mamet play
to open on Broad- Thursday
way this fall. They through
are bringing their Saturday at
spin on this char- 7:30 p.m.
acter-driven work Walgreen
to Studio One this Drama Center
weekend. Free
"A Life in the
Theatre" tells the
story of two men: a mentor and his
student who act together in a sea-
son of repertory theater, played by
School of Music, Theatre & Dance
seniors Yuriy Sardarov and Paul
Koch. As time goes on, their relation-
ship evolves while the theater begins
to have distressing effects on their
lives.
Koch and Sardarov are big players
in campus theater. Koch appeared in
"Orpheus Descending," which was
directed by Kacie Smith, a senior
in the School of Music, Theatre &
Dance, aswell as "Our Town." Smith
is directingKoch again for "A Life in
the Theatre." Sardarov appeared last
year in Basement Arts performances
"After Ashley" and "Twelve Angry
Men," as well as films like "The
Double," which stars Richard Gere,
Topher Grace and Martin Sheen.
Compared to a traditional audition
process, this production of "A Life in
the Theatre" has different roots -
Sardarov and Koch presented the idea
as an acting project to Smith.
"We said that we wanted a col-
laborative nature for the play. We
are constantly bouncing ideas off of
each other and giving each other our
input," Smith said. "We found this
projecttogetherandit's.muchmo
fleshed out and complex show than I
would have been able to accomplish
on my own.",
Accustomed to directing plays
with large casts, Smith had some res-
ervations about a two-man show.
"I've been a fan of bigger casts - I
like the dynamic of a lot of people in
the room and I like staging for more
people. I was a little worried coming
into this that I would not be stimu-
lated only working with two actors,"
Smith explained. "I'm so pleased
to say that I was completely wrong.
It's been very fulfilling because
we've been able to delve deeply into
the characters and actors in a way I
haven't been able to do in past pro-

ductions."
Smith took a brief hiatus in August
to go to New York City, leaving
her assistant director Neal Kelley,
School of Music, Theatre & Dance
sophomore, to take the reins in her
absence. Coming back, Smith had a
new perspective on the work.
"Part of the challenge as a direc-
tor is, once you get sofamiliar with a
work, it's hard to critique it from an
audience point of view," Smith said.
"Now I'm able to see and reinterpret
things that I didn't necessarily see
before."
Smith is relying less on the visual
aspects of theater and more on the
script for "A Life in the Theatre."
"We have basically done our own
costume and set design, there are
a lot of hats," Smith said. "It's not a
design-heavy show, we are focusing
more onthe acting. I tend to do spec-
tacle shows, and doing something
that's so low-tech and just elling the
story without the spectacle has not
been a challenge, but a wonderful
experience."
The play is just under an our
long, with quick transitions between
multiple scenes. The show takes you
everywhere from the dressing room
to the differentproductions in which
the two characters act over a period
of time.
"It's really impressive from an
acting perspective because you
watch them transform repeatedly.
One second they're two marooned
sailors, the next they're in their
dressing room, and the next they're
two World War II soldiers," Smith
explained. "It's interesting because
we think Mamet is playing off major
genres. It's taking these genres and
stretching the style to make it really
obvious that the play is in that style.'
"A Life in the Theatre" is comedic
and witty, butit also has serious mes-
sages that outline the tolls of being
an actor.
"It's a very tragic view of the the-
ater working him over, using his life,
cheing him up and spitting him
out," Smith said. "It's also about gen-
erations, the younger outstripping
the old and whether that's some-
thing to be proud of or if it's some-
thing to envy."
Finding these themes is harder
than it sounds; the play requires a
audience member to really examin4
the characters' relationship in eacl
scene.
"The show is not in your face at
all; it gives you a minimum amounj
of information," Smith said. "W *
have noticed that as characters, their
relationship evolves while their rela,
tionship backstage is also evolving;
It's not as clear cut as you may wanj
it to be."

Meatless take on 'A Very
Private Gentleman'
fails to stimulate
By BEN VERDI
Daily Arts Writer
It's becoming apparent that George Clo.-
ney ("Up in the Air") has a singular distaste
for being tied down. Why else would he keep
agreeing to movies in which his character
undergoes the same basic life transforma-
tion?
An isolated man obsessed
with his career who only
commits to brief flings
involving occasional sex -
this tagline could describe Americal
Clooney in real life, the man At Quality 16
he plays in the award-win- and Rave
ning "Up in the Air" or the
life of his newest character, Focus
an assassin of sorts (either
'named Jack or Edward depending on whom
he's talking to), in "The American."
While this Anton Corbijn ("Control")
movie is well directed and well cast, there is
little to sink your teeth into until almost the
very end. Meaning, not alot "happens" in this

movie. It's based on a book called "A Very Pri-
vate Gentleman," and it appears this gentle-
man truly didn't say much.
It's clear that most ofthe story in the novel
occurs in Jack/Edward's mind. While this
almost invisible plot style works in a novel,
it's a bit awkward when transferred to the
screen. That said, if you're going to stare
at one stone-faced actor this year and ask,
"What's going on in there?" it might as well
be Clooney.
When things do happen in this story,
they seem to carry .more weight than they
would were the plot full of confusing action
scenes and choppy dialogue. You can count
the number of real conversations that take
place in this film on your fingers. The sparse
dialogue becomes more memorable and
refreshing, like oases amongst the silence
that dominates most of the 105 minutes.
This ominous and dramatic silence pro-
vides the movie with its greatest strengths
and its most glaring weaknesses. While it
does heighten the tension and anticipation
in the viewer - whose patience is rewarded
with a perfectly twisted ending - the lack
of dialogue and action forces the camera to
do a lot of the story's work itself. This can
feel slightly annoying and heavy-handed at
times, and by the one-hour mark you might
find yourself saying "Okay, we get it!" to

many of the things the screen insists on
showing you.
We get it: Clooney has sex a lot. We get it:
Clooney has a dark past that he doesn't want
to talk about.
Even the de facto mentor and "moral oppo-
site" toour antihero, a priestwhose character
borders on stock, is a bit overdone. He looks
like Tommy LaSorda and sounds like Vito
Corleone. We get it. He's Italian.
Nevertheless, the film ends by bringing its
mumbled themes together in a creative way
that almost forces you to agree with what
Clooney seems to be saying (by deciding to
be in this movie) about the potential conse-
quences of settling down with one woman
and taking your eyes off "the mission," so to
speak. Women have hindered Clooney's char-
acter from accomplishing his assassin-style
tasks in the past, and "The American" ends
with what, by Clooney and his character, is
considered the most dangerous of human
endeavors: falling in love.
There are conclusions and analyses of the
struggle between the desire for career-driv-
en independence and allowing your fate to
fall out of your hands - by falling in love -
that can be made for years to come, but "The
American" basically tells us something we
already know.
We get it: Clooney, you're the best.

GET LOW
From Page 7A
predictable sort of transformation.
If the initial premise is to tell the back-
story of this mysterious legend, it doesn't
become clear until about halfway through
the film. Everything hinges on the mys-
tery of why the protagonist would choose
to isolate himself for 40 years and then
come back to throw his own funeral
party. It is evident, through the fractured
pieces of dialogue and engineered gruff-
ness, "Get Low" is a poor man's attempt
at Coen Brothers tragicomedy. Yet as the
film sputters through its grim one-liners
as if it were a protracted sketch on "Sat-
urday Night Live," it stagnates. Not until
a revealing dinner at Bush's cottage does
the plot question finally become apparent,
but at this point one hour into the film, the
audience cannot bring itself to really care.
From here, the buildup is antiseptic and
the climax does not so much burn out as

fizzle.
The folk tale-redemption circuit is a
storyline that is ripe to be explored, but
cinematographer-turned-director Aaron
Schneider ("Two Soldiers") simply does
not have a strong enough grasp of the cam-
era in order to make all the elements gel
together. Yet Schneider faithfully main-
tains a certain authenticity to the period
film, liberally dusting its mule-drawn car-
riages and storefront windows in sepia
tones with 6lan, while twanging fiddle
tunes scratch out melodies in the back-
ground. But for all its adherence to the
1930s rural Tennessee atmosphere, "Get
Low" cannot match its rather small char-
acters to romp in the period playground he
has provided for them.
With a run-time far too long for its rath-
er weak storyline, "Get Low" is not color-
ful or caricatured enough to match up to
the big expectations other tall-tale films
have already reached - not complicated
enough to become a star vehicle for Duvall
and not interesting enough for the audi-
ence to stay the entire way through.

Interpol gets awkward

Self-titled LP starts
with a bang before
fizzling into
pseudo-balladry
By JOSHUA BAYER
Daily Arts Writer
When a band releases a self-titled
LP, it usually means one of two things:
the record is either a
debut (The Smiths, The ***
Modern Lovers, Suede)
or a brazen follow-up Interpol
to an alleged master-
work (Portishead after Interpol
Dummy, Broken Social Matador
Scene after You Forgot
It In People, Liars after Drum's Not Dead,
etc.).
Interpol's Interpol is neither of these.
But, tactically, it's easy to see why the
band would decide to drop the eponym
bomb at this point in time. Ever since
Interpol debuted with the classic Turn
on the Bright Lights in 2002, the group
has been at the raw end of a struggle for
artistic ingenuity.
2004's Antics, while an incredibly
solid record, was essentially just a strip-
ping-down and cleaning-up ofthe outfit's
signature goth-grooving, with a shift in
emphasis from hazy doomsday catharsis
to lighter, mid-tempo riffing - a trick the
band could only pull once.
2007's Our Love to Admire was the
true red flag. The album's vapid attempt
to recapture the emotional intensity of
Bright Lights resulted in an incredibly
mixed bag of hair-raising head-boppers
("The Heinrich Maneuver," "Mam-
moth") and laughably contrived "men-
ace" ("Pioneer To The Falls," "All Fired
Up").
Interpol is Interpol's first true crack at
legitimately retooling its sound instead
of simply revamping it. Moreover, the
album is the band's most serious sonic
effort since its debut. While there are
flashes of the shadowy riffing and groov-
ing that define Interpol's aesthetic, the
record is undeniably the band's most
experimental outing to date, flaunting
an otherworldly exoticness that was only
hinted at superficially on Our Love to
Admire.
First, Interpol easily contains two
contenders for strongest song of 2010.
Album-opener "Success" and lead single
"Barricade" are both tendon-tightening

remixed nostalgia. Both tracks pump
like well oiled pistons, building jaw-
droppingly propulsive grooves out of
spaced-out,-in-the-pocket instrumenta-
tion, testifying to the fact that the band
is at its finest when focusing on sinisterly
funky drum-and-bass-and-double-gui-
tar chemistry.
While the rest of Interpol never really
matches the grand-slam-ness of those
two tracks, it packs a handful of similarly
stellar growers. "Memory Serves" is like

a sexy foray into a satanic strip club, con-
stantly threatening to short-circuit on its
tight, circular rhythms while stealthily
building steam. And "Lights" could be
the most intricate songthe band has ever
recorded, starting out with little more
than Paul Bank's funereal vocals and
austere guitar churning and seamlessly
evolving into a goliath of jagged arpeg-
gios and open-hi-hat drum pummeling.
Unfortunately, all of the aforemen-
tioned songs fall on the first half of

the album. After "Barricade," Interpol
slumps into a murky sludge of pseudo-
balladry that continues the album's vein
ofunbridled darkness andsonicmystique
but failsto balance it out with instrumen-
tal dynamism or pop sensibility.
"Try It On" mashes together Andrew
Bird-style whistling with glitchy stutter-
synths and a tense, wintry piano loop
that feels straight out of a dog sledding
documentary, epitomizing the album's
penchant for bizarre juxtapositions that
don't quite click. The song - and much
of the album's second half - is all pile-up
without any of the band's traditional gut-
punchy acrobatics, sounding like it could
have been assembled from loops. By the
time Banks is mariachi-ing in Spanish
over a bit-crushed drumbeat and retro,
horn-style synths on closer "The Undo-
ing," the term "shock value" has effec-
tively lost all of its meaning.
Ironically, on Interpol, the band's
weirdness quotient is almost in direct
proportion to its drabness quotient.
While the album's latter half is chock-
full of on-paper experimentation, it
comes across as a mopey skip-a-thon of
all gloom and no bite; the drumming is
either canned or nonexistent and the
basslines do little more than keep time
and underline Bank's vocals - a virtual
crime, considering Interpol has one of
the juiciest rhythm sections in indie rock
today. One can only hope that Interpol
is more of an awkward transition album
and less of a dead end.

"Is Bill Murray gonna have to chokabitch?"

Wolverines secure
win in the trenches

Players say "Bigger"
House is much louder

By JOE STAPLETON
Daily Sports Editor
Sensational sophomore Denard
Robinson, along with fellow sopho-
more Vincent Smith and junior
Michael Shaw, ran all over the hap-
less Connecticut defense during
Saturday's game, racking up almost
300 rushing yards.
But for every spectacular run -
and there were many - there was
a big, bulldozing offensive lineman
clearing the path. Sometimes it was
a sliver (which was all Robinson
or his running mates needed) and
sometimes it was so big all three
Wolverine quarterbacks could have
fit through it.
On defense, the extremely inex-
perienced secondary allowed a few
big plays but played reasonably well
overall. For what was undoubtedly
every Michigan fan's greatest worry

before the game, the young defen-
sive backfield held their own, barely
giving up any big plays and tackling
much better.
But behind almost every incom-
plete pass, there was a charging
defensive lineman ready to eat
Husky quarterback Zak Frazer as
a pre-dinner snack. Time and time
again, the linemen were pressuring
Frazer into rushing an off-balance
throw.
The game was filled with tremen-
dous plays for the Wolverines, but
none of them would have happened
if the men in the trenches hadn't
excelled like they did all game.
On the offensive line, it was senior
tackle and team captain Stephen
Schilling, as well as center David
Molk, paving the way for Robinson.

THE FIGHT OF
THE CENTURY
It's no surprise that Rich Rodriguez is
on the hot seat, but after two
seasons of irrelevance, so is the '
Michigan football program. j

The following is a special SportsTuesday
Column, following the Daily's exclusive sit-
down with Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez.
I sat down with Rich Rodriguez last
week in the days before his matchup
with Connecticut, my first time in a
relaxed setting with
the embattled coach to
talk about everything
he's been through in
his past two years in
Ann Arbor.
And I quickly real-
ized that it was impos-
sible to understand-
everything the man RYAN
has been through. KARTJE
He left his home, his
alma mater and his
blueprint in West Virginia, where he
went from canonization to demonization
in a matter of days. He knows that's the
nature and the passion of sports, but you
can feel the regret in his voice.

I asked him whether it hurt him that,
in the eyes of so many fans, he might
not be a Michigan Man. And I saw in his
response how much 8-16, NCAA viola-
tions and a whole host of other issues
have worn on him.
Upset by some of my questions,
exhausted by so little sleep, Rodriguez
shook my hand as I left. He didn't look
me in the eyes, likely grouping my ques-
tions with the "drama" that has been
swirling around him like a dark, acid
rain-filled cloud for so long.
And who would blame him? The 32
months Rodriguez has been here have
left him beaten and bruised. Thirty-two
straight rounds of an epic boxing match
with media, alumni and angry fans. Each
time, Rodriguez has returned to his cor-
ner - sometimes all alone in his spot in
the ring - despite the virtual pummel-
ing he has taken since moving shop from
Morgantown.

est sense of the word. With each hay-
maker, each uppercut, he has stuck to his
guns, despite the beating he took because
of it.
"We work everyday, everyday I get up,
everyday I go to bed thinking about what
I can do to make this the best program in
America," Rodriguez told me and Daily
Editor in Chief Jacob Smilovitz, full of
emotion.
"That's all I think about, that's all we
think about. So the rest of it is drama. I
don't need to deal with it."
Few people have a chance to see this
Rodriguez, the emotionally drained foot-
ball coach who clearly feels the weight
of the program crashing in on him. He is
a man who has made mistakes, plenty of
them. But it's hard, after speaking with
him, to see him as more than a victim of
circunmstance in some regard, unaware
of the gargantuan level of pressure upon
his arrival that stared him straight in the
eyes from across the ring.
What his
doubters - those
throwing the
punches - don't
understand or
often forget, is
that the Michi-
gan football pro-
gram is in much
too dire of straits
to continue on
its rope-a-dope,
fight-to-the-
death of Rodri-
guez.
Because both
Rodriguez and
m '' the Michigan
' football program
are locked in
the Fight of the
Century, and the
results of this
year's season
could determine
t the direction for
the next 10 or so
years.
When Bo
Schembechler
took over the
Wolverines' pro-
gram in 1969, not
only was he from
Ohio, but he was
mostly unknown

to those at Michigan. An anonymous
coach who worried mhany because of his
brash coaching style.
But Schembechler was inheriting a
dying program. After years of mediocre
teams fielded by Bump Elliott, the Wol-
verines were slowly slipping into obscu-
rity.
So when Schembechler's team defeat-
ed Woody Hayes's Buckeyes that first
season in one of college football's most
heralded upsets of all time, Schem-
bechler singlehandedly had set the
Wolverines for the next 30-40 years. He
never fought for support in Ann Arbor,
and although his record left little room
for criticism, not many questioned him
about his lack of a title or his 5-12 record
in postseason play. Hell, they made him
athletic director.
But Schembechler's almost four-
decade coast has ended, and the program
is in actual danger of slipping back into
the relative obscurity they knew before
Bo.
Now, I'm not foolish enough to think
that the winningest program in NCAA
history will be gone forever. No one is
foolish enough to tell you that.
But if Rodriguez and the Wolverines
aren't able to muster enough to save
Rodriguez's job this season, there's a
good chance Michigan fans will remain
in their front-row seats to a massive col-
lapse.
Rodriguez's hypothetical vacancy
would leave a clear opening for fan favor-
ite Jim Harbaugh or a similar big-name
"Michigan Man" to take his place. But
Harbaugh and many other coaches like
him mean at least two more seasons of
transition, more time to install a new
offense and possibly more underachieve-
ment.
Five years is a long time to be irrel-
evant (just ask Nebraska post-Tom
Osborne), and if the Wolverines hope to
avoid that five-year total, that Husker-
esque fall, they'll need to let Rodriguez
fight another round. Or at least give him
an ample shot to deliver a few punches of
his own.
Because if Rodriguez loses this fight,
Michigan loses too.
It's easy to forget for some, what with
his acquired-taste charisma and West
Virginia accent, that Rodriguez was
brought to Ann Arbor because he was
known as a football genius, the pioneer of
the spread offense.

"We work everyday,
everyday I get up,
everyday I go to bed *
thinking about what
I can do to make this
the best progam in*
America."
- Rich Rodriguez
And he knows that the first two years
of his tenure didn't go as planned. He
made it clear to us that the process is
going much slower than he had even
planned for.
"I knew after the first spring it was
going to take a little longer to do what we
wanted to do," Rodriguez said.
"You just try to focus on doing what
you've got to do to build the best program
in America and I still believe we've made
strides to that end. It's just been a lot
slower than anyone wants - especially
me and my staff."
Those strides, those first few haymak-
ers to the doubters who had bludgeoned
him for so long came Saturday, when his
spread offense led by Denard Robinson
made a good team look absolutely silly.
Connecticut coach Randy Edsall made
sure to announce to the world that Rodri-
guez, after two years, is ready to fight,
with his spread offense to boot.
"It's ddja vu all over again, West Vir-
ginia, Pat White, 3rd down and 15 and
they run the quarterback draw. Here we
go again," Edsall said.
And that's what he was hired for.
That's why he's been fighting for 32
straight months.
Maybe you don't think Rich Rodriguez
is a Michigan Man. Or the right man for
the job.
But he's the only man for right now.
And if Saturday was any indication, he
may make a lot more people look silly
before he taps out.

Michigan sophomore quarterback Denard Robinson secured the starting position after Saturday's performance.

BIGGER HOUSE
From Page 1B
more of an echo, and it gets you
riled up. It's nothing like last year,
it's way louder."
Of course, 113,090 fans - the
largest crowd ever at a football
game according to Michigan offi-
cials - may have had something to
do with that.
"That's why they call it the Big
House," junior tight end Kevin
Koger said. "We have the most
seats, we have the craziest fans.
I was thinking during the game,
'Dang there's a lot of people here,
more than usual.'"
Added freshman punter Will
Hagerup: "When you have a crowd
in there, the biggest crowd in foot-
ball history, and they're all yelling
and they're all into it, I can't see
how that can't be a problem for the
other team."
TATE TRANSFER?: After sitting
on the bench with a towel over his
head and shoulders for much of fel-
low sophomore Denard Robinson's
record-setting performance on
Saturday, quarterback Tate Forcier
told Ann Arbor.com, "All you need
to know is that I'm out."
Forcier declined comment to the
Daily after the game.
When Robinson went down in
the third quarter, both Forcier and
freshman Devin Gardner began
to get loose, but ultimately, it was
Gardner who spelled Robinson
for the few plays that he was out,
despite the fact that Forcier started
every game for the Wolverines last
season.
Forcier quelled rumors earlier
in the summer of a transfer, but
his comments following the game

brought questions of him leaving
the program to the forefront.
In a tweet from MGoBlog's Tom
Van Haaren, Forcier's father, Mike,
responded to questions about his
son possibly transferring.
"As Tate's father, and someone
who would advise him, a trans-
fer isn't something I want to be a
part of," Mike said. "Sometimes
you think, 'Man, do they want him
there?' But we don't think that's
the situation. Rich Rodriguez has
also been straight with us."
SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES: Of
all the areas Rodriguez had shown
concern this summer, special
teams was one of the most worri-
some.
And after Saturday, which
brought windy conditions for most
of the game, questions aren't nec-
essarily answered about the young,
inexperienced position group.
Hagerup only attempted one
punt on the day - aroll punt which
landed and rolled for a total of 51
yards. Meanwhile, redshirt fresh-
man kicker Brendan Gibbons was
1-for-2 on field goals, missing one
short earlier in the game due to
the wind. He also missed an extra
point and struggled to fight the
wind on a few kickoffs.
Special teams coach Tony Gib-
son said the weather was too much
of an issue for the two to be prop-
erly evaluated.
"The wind was just swirling all
day," Gibson said. "We couldn't
ever get it down. It was with us
once, against us once. We just have
to keep trying at it."
INJURY NOTES: Freshman
hybrid safety Carvin Johnson has
a sprained MCL and is day-to-day
after going down in the second
quarter.

Sophomore quarterback
Denard Robinson is going
to start in Saturday's game
against Notre Dame, Michigan
coach Rich Rodriguez said on
Monday.
Finally, no waiting until the
night before to name a starter.
"Do the same thing you did
last week," NOTEBOOK
Rodri-
guez joked with the media at
his weekly press conference
Monday. "Ask me if he's going
to play, who's going to be the
starter.
"You think it would be a
surprise if (Robinson) doesn't
start? He's earned the start for
sure."
Rodriguez said he would
still give other quarterbacks
reps in practice this week, even
after Robinson set a school
rushing record (197 yards in
one game) for a quarterback
and was 19-for-22 through the
air.
Since the end of Saturday's
game, Robinson's perfor-
mance has garnered quite a
bit of attention from local and
national media outlets. Rob-
inson was named the Walter

after the game. "We made down-
hill runs and we tried to take it
to them. It work for us early, and
it kind of set the tempo for the
rest of the game."
That physicality was abigrea-
son the Wolverine offen-
sive line was able to push
around the undersized
Husky defensive line all
day long, which was how
Michigan held onto the
ball and kept its defense
off the field.
The Wolverines held
possession for 36:52. The
Huskies? 23:08. Michi-
gan's offense racked up
scoring drives of 14, 7, 8,
19 and 11 plays.
It was winning the
time of possession battle
that allowed the Michi-
gan defensive line to
continue to rush the
quarterback and stuff the
run all game.
"That was absolutely
amazing," redshirtjunior
defensive end Ryan Van
Bergen said. "I don't
knowfor how many plays
I was on the field but I
honestly feel pretty fresh
right now.
"The offensive line did
a really great job and the
whole offense did a great
job of picking up first
downs when weuneeded
them."
The defensive line
gave up just 138 yards
rushing to Connecticut,
almost half of which
came in the fourth quar-
ter. And despite not
recording a sack, the line

was all over Frazer.
Especially active was
sophomore Craig Roh.
Roh was all over the field,
recording five tackles,
two for a loss.
"Myself and the
defense as a whole was
just hungry," Roh said.
"We were so hungry ..
We were making plays,

Missed chances hurt Blue

By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
In Michigan's Friday night match
against No. 14 Drake, the men's soc-
cer team took as many shots, shots
on goal and corner kicks as its oppo-
nent.
The Bulldogs even committed 15
fouls in the game, leavingthe potent
Wolverine offense plenty of chances
to s ink a shot in the back of the net
to reward their dominant, statisti-
cally-excellent performance.
But as the clock wound down,
Michigan looked up to the score-
board; Drake 1, Michigan 0.
"Overall it's tough to accept a
defeat when in every statistical cat-
egory you win and you dominate,"
Burns said after the game. "But yet
they win the one statistical category
that counts - scoring. I think it's the
experience of recognizing the game
is about scoring goals."
And goals have been difficult to
come by for Michigan, even though
the Wolverines (1-1) have kept
offensive pressure high in their two
games so far this season.
Michigan hasn't had trouble
finding scoring opportunities -
the team made nine shots on goal
against Drake as well as eight shots
on in Wednesday's overtime win
against the University of Detroit.
But even with veteran scoring
threats like senior forward Justin
Meram and sophomore midfielder
Hamoody Saad - two of Michi-
gan's top three scorers last season
- on the field at the same time, the
Wolverines have struggled to con-
vert the opportunities they create
into goals on the scoreboard.
"You've got to give everything
to score those goals," Burns said.
"We create enough chances, we
had enough chances (against
Drake). Wasn't like their keeper
played great. Unfortunately we
didn't score one."
Prior to the two home games
this past week, the Wolverines
took part in exhibition games in
which they experienced similar
futility, as Michigan tied West
Virginia, 0-0, and Evansville, 1-1,
in preseason action.
The Michigan offense has given
opponents' backfields fits in its
two regular season games, as it has
consistently kept the ball moving
on its opposition's side of the mid-

field. The Wolverines have set off
53 shots, but only two have found
their way past the opposing keeper.
"I think we had a really good
match (against Drake)," fresh-
man midfielder Fabio Pereria Vil-
las Boras said. "Of all the matches
we've played so far, this one was
probably the best one. We just
didn't score. We've just got to work
on finishing."
By not sinking any of its 26 shots
against Drake, Michigan gave
its junior keeper Chris Blais an
extremely small margin of error
to work with. When a deflection
led to a Bulldog goal in the 56th
minute on Friday, the Wolverines'
offensive efforts became irrel-
evant.

Michigan needs to capital-
ize on the set pieces it's given, as
numerous Drake fouls led to un-
successful Wolverine corner kicks
on Friday.
Meram explained how the Wol-
verines will need to capitalize on'
the opportunities they get to put
the ball in the back of the net. He
further explained how the team
is going to work on set pieces a lot
more before going into Seattle.
Michigan travels to the Seat-
tle University Tournament this
upcoming weekend, looking to
rebound from the frustrating
Drake loss. The team will play in
an unfamiliar environment, and
coach Burns warned that his team
needs to "pack more intelligence,

more defensive intensity and more
of a... sneer and an attitude.
"If you don't bring those things
on the road, the opponents can get
you," Burns said.
While the Wolverines con-
trolled the majority of the pace,
the intensity, and the opportuni-
ties in their loss to Drake, Michi-
gan needs to continue to press
opposing defenses to get on the
scoreboard early and often this
weekend.
The Drake loss may still sting
for some Wolverines, which might
be just the fire the team needs to
continue wearing their opponents'
defense down - and finally "give
everything" to convert opportuni-
ties of their own.

strategy of dropping nine or some-
times ten players into its half. The
Golden Bear offense had to rely
on playing long balls up to a lone
forward, evident by the fact that
Michigan had nine shots while
Oakland only managed three and
did nothave a single corner.
"We did a good job of defending,
adopted a strategy and defensive
system, but it was Oakland's defen-
sive system that worked," Ryan
said after the game. "We were try-
ing to attack with as many players
as we could."
The Wolverines (3-3-1) faced
weather more common in Novem-
ber ratherthan September. Massive
gusts of wind were not conducive
to long aerial passes, forcing the


Wolverines to play the ball on the
ground for the entire match. Cou-
pled with lower temperatures than
the young Wolverines had seen up
to this point, Michigan had a diffi-
cult time executing its offense.
It took 73 minutes for Michi-
gan to slowly erode the Oakland
defense. Two super-subs - junior
Meghan Hennessy and freshman
Kayla Mannino - connected for
the game winner. They were told
by Ryan to catalyze the offense
while Hennessy came off the bench
with one thing in mind- to score a
goal. The clincher occurred when
Mannino crossed a pretty ball in
from the right to an approaching
Hennessy who, in the center of the
box, eloquently redirected it in the
net for the winner.
Redshirt sophomore keeper
Haley Kopmeyer completed her
second shutout in a row and her
eighth career shutout by saving
one shot. She moved up to fourth
on Michigan's all-time shutout
list.
"All our games have been
tight," Ryan said. "We have lots of
young players and learning how
to win tight games is important.
Once you get a lead, you have to
take care of it. It is critical that
we beat teams like oakland so we
have a shot to make the tourna-
ment."
For a rather young team, look-
ing into a nine-person defense
on a droll dark field can be very
daunting, but with this win the
season continues to look brighter.

'-M' for season

Junior hitter Alex Hunt is Michigan's biggest threat up at the net this season.

By CHANTEL JENNINGS
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan men's basketball
team will seem a little bit older when
it takes the court at Crisler Arena for
the first game of the season, thanks
to its European basketball tour.
The Wolver-
ines arrived state- NOTEBOOK
side last Saturday
after going 1-3 against four profes-
sional Belgian teams. Michigan's
lone victory came in the final game
against Mons, in which the Wol-
verines played in front of a sellout
crowd.
Sophomore Matt Vogrich led
scorers that day with 22 points after
going 4-for-7 from 3-point range.
And while it was Vogrich who
impressed the crowds, Michigan
coach John Beilein said that for each
game there were different players
who stood out to him and the rest
of the coachingstaff, both with skill
and confidence.
"We'd rather have a guy with
swagger that you can tone down
a bit, than have a guy who's afraid
out there that you have to give him
permission to dunk on somebody,"
Beilein said, praising freshmen Tim
Hardaway Jr. and Evan Smotrycz's
play in Europe.
Hardaway was the team's lead-
ing scorer, averaging 11.8 points per
game. The Wolverines used him
similarly to Manny Harris in past
seasons. But one advantage Hard-
away offers that Harris couldn't is
his size - as a freshman he weighs
more than Harris ever did at 185 lbs.
Michigan's lineup remained the
same all four games - juniors Zack
Novak and Stu Douglass, sopho-
mores Darius Morris and Matt
Vogrich and redshirt freshman
Blake McLimans.

The Wolverines returntoa limited
practice schedule Wednesday, with
individual workouts until Nov. 15,
when the practices will expand to six
or seven players for two hours a week.
2010 SCHEDULE ANNOUNCED:
This year, the Wolverines' regular-
season schedule will feature 18 Big
Ten games rather than just 16.
The regular seasonwill start Nov.
S in Ann Arbor against an opponent
not yet determined. Michigan will
then partake in the 2010 Legends
Classic which pits the Wolverines
against Bowling Green, Gardner-
Webb, Syracuse and concludes with
the winner of Georgia Tech and
UTEP. They will follow that up with
the championship round of the tour-
nament in Atlantic City, N.J. before
the annual ACC/Big Ten Challenge
game against Clemson.
Following their contest against
the Tigers, Michigan will play host to
eight straight games and won't have
to leave Ann Arbor until January.
Outside of the Big Ten games and
Clemson, the Jan. 9 Kansas game
should be a benchmark for a team
hoping to return to postseason play
after a surprisingly disappointing
2009-10 season.
"We try to pick out games where
a road win would be tremendous
and a tough road loss, like the
U-Conn game from two years ago
... might have helped us to get in the
(NCAA) tournament as much as the
Duke win," Beileinsaid of his team's
schedule strength.
INJURY UPDATE: Freshman for-
ward Colton Christian is the only
Wolverine who didn't see playing
time in Europe, due to a hamstring
injury. Beilein is hoping that Chris-

Wolverines looking good

Gibby replaces Warhurst, hopes

after first non-Scoring race to start season on strong note

By AMY SCARANO
Daily Sports Writer
When the top five Michigan
runners finished within 23 sec-
onds of each other at the Michi-
gan Open in Dexter on Friday, it
meant one thing: they're off to a
fine start. Michigan coach Mike
McGuire was satisfied. An East-
ern Michigan runner crossed the
finish line first followed by seven
Wolverines.
The women's cross country
team stretched their legs at the
annual informal non-scoring
meet to get the season underway
as the Wolverines won't com-
pete again until the middle of
the month at the Spartan Invita-
tional.
After a summer of individual
training and just 10 days of cross
country camp at the Michigan
Biological Station, the top five
ran together surprisingly well,
as did the team as a whole.
The goal is always to stay as
a pack as far along in the race as
possible in order to help pace and
push one another.

But that doesn't usually come
without practice. When the top
five runners finish within sec-
onds of each other before regular
team practices begin, that's usu-
ally a sign of success (especially
when the races become 6Ks later
in the season).
Sophomore Kaitlyn Patterson
and senior Danielle Tauro are
projected to be the team's best
this year and they crossed the
finish line first and second for
Michigan.
"It's really tough to stay at
a tough pace when you are by
yourself and pushing yourself,"
Tauro said. "I did the best that
I could with maybe 800 or 600
to go. K Pat came up on me and
that's really what I needed was a
little kick in the butt."
Patterson is known for her
endurance and Tauro for her
extra kick at the end of a race.
They hope the combination will
help them capture the Big Ten
title as a team.
Tauro, the only senior on
the roster, has been on track to
lead since her sophomore year.

Forced to redshirt last season
when injuries plagued her and
other upperclassman, now-
sophomores were thrown into
scoring roles as freshman. As a
result, they improved tremen-
dously in their first year and are
expected give the team an extra
boost this season.
Michigan is running as a pack
right from the start this season
as a result, and a healthy Tauro
is hoping to make her debut as an
All-American this season. She's
had that goal since sophomore
year, at which time she used the
word "eventually" before All-
American.
After Friday's race, her
emphatic fist pump seemed to
show her confidence that this
year is going to be different. She
was the first Wolverine to cross
the line, followed by Patterson
seven seconds later, a trend that
will likely continue.
"If we can keep a short gap (22
or 23 seconds) once we extend
it over to 6K then we are going
to be in pretty good shape,"
McGuire said.

Five Michigan athletes raced
only their teammates in Friday's
non-scoring Michigan Open in
Dexter, MI, marking the begin-
ning of a new era in the men's
cross country program. Legend-
ary coach Ron Warhurst stepped
down in July after 36 years, leav-
ing the future in the hands of Wol-
verine coach Alex Gibby.
Gibby, a 1997 graduate of Wil-
liam and Mary College in Virginia,
spent the last seven years as head
cross country coach at his alma
mater, where he garnered four
top-16 finishes in the NCAA cross
country championships before
taking the job at Michigan. He
brought four volunteer coaches
from William and Mary, gradu-
ates who at one time ran for him
there. He will also be serving as
assistant coach to the men's track
and field team.
Luckily for Gibby - who has a
winning reputation to maintain -
a new coach in distance running
doesn't necessarily mean a cou-

ple of wasted years. Although he
was unfamiliar with Warhurst's
training regimen, Gibby is confi-
dent that his different approaches
to reaching the same goals -
strength, speed and endurance -
will not set his athletes back.
"It's just a matter of trying to
blend the changes in stylistically,"
Gibby said. "Their preparation to
date, especially over the summer,
is drastically different from what
I'd have them doing, but that's not
good or bad.
"It just means there's a price to
pay right now and we will reap the
benefit of that price come Novem-
ber."
There will, however, remain
numerous unknowns through
most of September as 13 of the
squad's 22 runners are new this
year.
Junior Bobby Aprill and red-
shirt junior Craig Forys, along
with the seven sophomores on the
team, hope to welcome the fresh-
men and teach them a lesson or
two along the way. But they aren't
worried about the new coach-
ing style. In fact, they find some

reassurance in the changes Gibby
brings.
"Coach Gibby is doing a good
job of letting us know why he does
what he does and mapping out the
season," Forys said. "Keeping us
informed is the biggest change I
think. Last year we were guess-
ing a lot with coach Ron. (Gibby's)
going to ask a lot out of us and we
are going to trust him."
After sitting out due to an inju-
ry last cross country season, Forys
is happy to have two strong legs
and his fitness back. A young team
and a new coach are no excuse for
this bunch not to perform, he said.
"We've got to go into the Big
Ten meet thinking we are goingto
win because there's no reason to
go in not thinkingthat way," Forys
said.
The Wolverines finished in
fifth place in last year's Big Ten
Championship at Penn State. This
season, the meet is at the end of
October in Madison.
"I'm running out of time, so I'm
ready to get it done," Forys said.
"We are going to work with each
other. There's no time to waste."

NBA" DROPS GATORADE*
AND PICKS UP
BTB
By Ghost Writer
David Sternson announced today the NBA 
is dropping longtime sponsor Gatorade" as the official
refreshment of the NBA, and instead is going with up
and coming BTB Queso. In a prepared statement re-
leased by the league Sternson said, "Truthfully, Gato-
rade* was offering us more money, but the player's and
owner's just prefer Queso!"
BTB Queso has been spotted on the sidelines of
games since BTB intoduced the melty cheese dip at
it's Cantina location 8 months ago. But it hadn't really
taken hold until the NBA* Finals, when Lakers play-

er's dumped Queso on coach Phil Jackson, rather than
the traditional Gatorade* After that point players, both
professional and amateur, have been seen chugging
queso during games as a thirst quencher. Even runners
are getting into the action, preferring spectators to hold
cups of queso on the sidelines instead of water.
The decision by the NBA* is a niajor blow to Ga-
torade*, who has long held the position as the drink
of choice of the major sports leagues. Gatorade' ad-
mits to being blindsided. "We thought that Powerade'
had the best chance of taking our sponsorship spot, not
a cheese dip from an Ann Arbor based Burrito place!
We've done tests! Queso doesn't even have electro-
lytes!"
Although Queso does not have electrolytes,
word from the BTI B Burrito camp is that is has fresh
red., green, and jalapeno peppers, along with 3 kinds of
cheese and is made fresh daily. For these reasons, GM
Brent lgwood is not suiprised by Queso's acceptance
in the mainstream. "We knew it would catch on eventu-
ally" See QUESO, Page 6

CONFUSION
ENDS IN JOYOUS REUNION
By Jane Doe
BTB's giant steak burrito fits perfectly in a
car seat, just ask Tom Smith. At 8:02pm on Friday,
Smith was seen carrying a giant burrito out of B'B
Burrito on State St. ie allegedly cradled the burrito
in his aims as he walked to his car. He proceeded to
open the back door of the vehicle to place the burrito
in a car seat, all the while speaking baby-talk to the
giant burrito.
Bystanders watched in confusion as Smith
buckled the bUtrito into the seat, shut the door,
jumped in the driver seat and drove off. "He seemed
to be distracted, he was talking into his phone excit-
edly how much he loves BTB," says Joey Mesik, a
student at IJniversity of Michigan. Mesik said sur-
rounding bystanders exchanged perplexed glances as
they heard Smith exclaim loudly into the phone "I
just can't get enough of this place!" while buckling
the burrito safely in the car seat.
"I jst can't,

BTB BUCK SURPASSES

According to a statement released from Federal Re-

cy iii the world. "It's no surprise," says the Reseirved,
"With last month's introduction of queso and this week's
launch of ground beef it was only a matter of time un-

was shut out for the second time
in four games despite being out-
shot by just one, 9-10.
The Wolverines were also
unable to capitalize on a 5-3
penalty-corner advantage.
In fact, an inability to put the
ball into the back of the net has
plagued Michigan through the
first four games of the season,
having scored just twice in the
team's first four games.
"They finished, we didn't,"
Michigan coach Marcia Pan-
kratz said after the game.
One potential explanation
for the team's offensive woes is
its youth.
Michigan (0-4) has nine true
freshman and one redshirt
freshman on a roster comprised
of 22 players.
Of those players, many have
already begun seeing increased 1432 W
roles this season.
Freshmen Rachael Mack
and Michelle Roberts both
received their first starts of the mus
year against Connecticut (3-0),

lory Albini has started every 11:00 am

The team's lack of offensive
potency could also be attribut-
ed to the early-season schedule,
which includes the Huskies, No.

From Page 1B
junior tight end Kevin Koger said.
"You didn't see anybody droop.
That was really big for us. We're
more mature this year, we know
more of the offense."
The Wolverines had the ball for
nearly 14 more minutes than Con-
necticut. In the second half, the
Huskies had just three posses-
sions. The Huskies had nine pos-
sessions the entire game.
Entering the season opener,
it was widely assumed that the
defense would be an area of con-
cern for Michigan. The Wolver-
ines' strong running game helped
that perceived weakness.
"(It's) gotta help them," run-
ning backs coach Fred Jackson
said of the defense. "They're not
out there as many snaps. When
you do that it helps tremendous-
ly because now they're playing
40-50 snaps instead of 70 snaps.
If we've got anything we need to
improve on, itgives them a chance
to just get collected and be able to

be better as a unit."
After the game, defensive play-
ers were going up to fifth-year
senior offensive lineman Steve
Schilling and thanking him for
how well the offense played. Sat-
urday, the defense had a chance to
regroup, a luxury the unit wasn't
afforded during Rodriguez's first
two years at Michigan. Turnovers
and short drives kept the Wolver-
ines' defense on the field a lot.
The Wolverines' ability to con-
vert 14 of 19 third downs and avoid
penalties and turnovers, allowed
the Michigan offense to get into a
groove and continue drives - four
of which were 75-yards or longer.
"The first two years you (saw)
we had a lot of three-and-outs,"
Koger said. "That was a big thing
they were emphasizing this year
- converting third downs. That
was a key for us today, keeping our
defense fresh."
Not once did the Wolverines go
three-and-out against Connecti-
cut.
It helped that Michigan has the
dangerous Robinson to employ on
third downs. The Huskies defense
