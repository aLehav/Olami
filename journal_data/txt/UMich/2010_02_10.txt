MSA passes resolution to voice

In light of new
evidence, man
freed by clinic will
stand trial again
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
For the Daily
Though the University's
Innocence Clinic helped
Dwayne Provience get out of
jail last November, prosecutors
now plan to retry the case.
Provience, 36, was tried and
convicted of the murder of
Detroit resident Rene Hunter
in 200t. With the help of the
Law School's Innocence Clinic,
University Law students got
Provience's conviction thrown
out by a Wayne County judge
on Nov. 3, 2009 on the grounds
of withheld evidence.
Though the Law students
thought the case was over
when Provience was set free,
the prosecution has now called
for the case to be retried.
Innocence clinic officials
said legal constraints prevent
them from commenting on why
the prosecution is motioning
for a retrial.
In a Detroit News article
published in December, Maria
Miller, spokeswoman for
Wayne County Prosecutor Kym

Worthy, said the prosecution
intends to proceed with the
case, but also would not com-
ment on the specifics of the
retrial.
"It is appropriate for a jury to
hear this case and make a deci-
sion based upon the evidence
we will produce at trial," Miller
said in the article.
Provience was originally con-
victed of murder based on the
testimony of Detroit resident
Larry Wiley, who said Provi-
ence shot Hunter while Provi-
ence and his brother drove by
in a beige Buick two-door.
After a hearing last year,
Wiley said he was not at the
scene of the crime and recanted
his 2001 testimony.
In a hearing held on Jan. 27,
Circuit Court Judge Timothy
Kenny ruled Wiley can't tes-
tify in the retrial scheduled for
April 5 without incriminating
himself for lying under oath
during the first trial. If Wiley
doesn't testify on April 5, his
testimony from the first trial
cannot be used as evidence
either.
A police report that surfaced
in Deceinber cites seven eyewit-
nesses who claimed the shoot-
er was driving a vehicle that
looked different than the beige
Buick that Wiley had described
in his original testimony.

The Michigan Student Assem-

in support of a state bill that pro-

With the passage of the reso-

the Michigan Senate Judiciary
Committee that MSA supports
House Bill 4876 - or the Medical
Amnesty Act. If passed, the act
would allow intoxicated minors

for friends or themselves to be
exempt from punishment.
The Michigan House of Repre-
sentatives passed the bill by a vote
of 98-7 on Oct. 21, 2009. The bill
was passed on to the Michigan

Though the concept of knowing

associated with Facebook, a new
campaign launched by a Univer-

other students to pay attention to a
different kind of status.

City urges
residents, students

By MELISSA MARCUS
For the Daily'
In an effort to encourage stu-
dents and Ann Arbor residents
to recycle more, the city of Ann
Arbor and non-profit organi-
zation Recycle Ann Arbor are
working together to streamline

the city's recycling system and
increase awareness about recy-
cling.
The city of Ann Arbor cur-
rentlyuses a dual-streammeth-
od of recycling, featuring two
main components. The first
category of products that can
be recycled are paper products,
which includes magazines,
newspapers and flattened cere-
al boxes. The second group is
containers made from metal,
glass and plastic.
. But, in the summer of 2010,

the city will begin to use a sin-
gle-stream, which officials say
is a more efficient system. This
means that more products will
be able to be recycled, accord-
ing to Kendra Pyle, residential
coordinator for Recycle Ann
Arbor. The revamp of the sys-
tem will focus on expanding
the types of plastics that can be
recycled within the city.
Pyle explained that the
rationale behind the new, sin-
gle-stream system is that new

When the U' had snow days

Despite all the snow covering cam-
pus, the chances of class being cancelled
are slim.
Butthe story knownto manystudents
about a University Law student suing
the University for money lost because
of a snow day cancellation is an urban
legend.
While the story is entertaining to
prospective students touring campus,
University spokeswoman Kelly Cun-
ninghamsaid itnsimply isn't true.
"While there's been a long-standing
rumor about such a lawsuit, the Univer-
sity's Office of the General Counsel has
never found any record of it," Cunning-
ham said yesterday.
But University officials are still hesi-
tant to cancel classes - the University
hasn'thad a snow day since 1978 when 19
inches of snow covered campus.
According to a Jan. 28, 1978 article in
The Michigan Daily, students spent the
day lounging in the snow, with "Endless

Summer" serving as their background
music. In addition, some students also
got sunburns from spending the day
lounging in the snow, according to the
article.
The storm caused classes to be can-
celled for more than a day and because
it came on the day of the add/drop dead-
line, thatdeadline had to be extended.
The storm's widespread effect was
so great that President Jimmy Carter
declared a state of emergency for Michi-
gan - ordering snowplows, patrol cars
and National Guard trucks to help clear
snow in the city, on campus and through-
out the state, according to the article.
During the process of snow clearing,
many other University events and activi-
ties were postponed, according to the
article. The inclement weather meant
food could not be delivered to the dining
halls and campus eateries. As a result,
dieticians had to get food from local
markets to hold the dining halls over and

keep students fed until food deliveries
could resume.
Cunningham said the likelihood of
another snow day is very rare because
most students live on or close to campus.
"We basically never cancel classes
because we're a residentialschool,"Cun-
niugham said. "People can gethere."
In the University's nearly 200-year
history, classes have only been can-
celled University-wide two othertimes,
once in 1945 and again in 1974, accord-
ing to a Dec. 7, 2006 article published in
the Daily.
The University's Flint and Dearborn
campuses cancel classes more frequent-
ly because ofthe large commuter student
population. Both campuses cancelled
all classes and activities for the day at
4 p.m. yesterday in anticipation of the
winter weather, according to an article
published yesterday in the University
Record.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Man charged in
* Detroit airport
breach
The 27-year-old Ohio man who
was arrested after authorities say
he walked through a passenger
screening checkpoint at Detroit
Metropolitan Airport without a
boarding pass faces a new charge.
The Wayne County prosecutor's
office filed the charge of resisting
and obstructing a police officer
yesterday.
The charge comes after the man
identified in a criminal complaint
as Kaylan L. Policherla appeared
briefly in U.S. District Court in
Detroit. He's charged there with
violating federal security require-
ments.
Magistrate Judge Mark
Randon also granted federal
defender Dave Tholen's request
for a mental health evaluation
for the Bryan, Ohio, resident.
LANSING
State GOP calls for
changes in business
tax, incentives
Republicans in the Michigan
House said Tuesday they want
to phase out the surcharge on
the state's main business tax and
reshape tax incentive programs
in hopes of sparking job creation.
The broad, 33-page plan
pitched by the House's minor-
ity party calls for consolidating
many of Michigan's industry-spe-
cific tax breaks such as those for
alternative energy, life sciences
and homeland security into larg-
er, more generic pools. Support-
ers say that would allow projects
with the most potential economic
benefit - including existing busi-
nesses and entrepreneurs - to
have a better shot at getting tax
incentives.
ETax credits for areas such as
brownfield redevelopment and the
film industry would be capped.
Business taxes also would be
targeted by House Republicans.
They would phase out the sur-
charge on the Michigan Busi-
ness Tax that raises more than
$500 million a year. Another
proposal calls for eliminating
personal property taxes that
cost businesses about $75 million
a year on items such as equip-
ment, furniture and computers.
WASHINGTON
Winter weather
won't stop federal
government
If snow keeps 230,000 govern-
ment employees home for the bet-
ter part of a week, will anyone
notice?
With at least another foot of
snow headed for Washington,
Philadelphia and New York, we're
about to find out. The federal gov-
ernment in the nation's capital
has largely been shut down since
Friday afternoon, when a storm

began dumping up to 3 feet of
snow in some parts of the region.
Offices were remaining closed at
least through Wednesday.
So far, the effects have been
negligible. Many essential gov-
ernment services are performed
at offices around the country,
and about 85 percent of federal
employees work outside the Wash-
ington region anyway.
KABUL, Afghanistan
Over 60 feared

A series of avalanches engulfed

Granholm to
release school
funding plan

First lady Michelle Obama speaks about childhood obesity on Jan. 28, 2010 at the YMCA in Alexandria, Va.
Fire lady begins fight
against chi ldhood o

Michelle Obama
hopes new plan will
be her legacy
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Michelle Obama yesterday
unveiled "Let's Move" - her
national public awareness cam-
paign against childhood obesity,
a problem she says concerns her
both as first lady and as a mom.
One in three American chil-
dren are overweight or obese,
putting them at higher risk of
developing diabetes, high blood
pressure, high cholesterol and
other illnesses. Billions of dol-
lars are spent every year treating
obesity-related conditions. And

public health experts say today's
kids are on track to have shorter
lifespans than their parents.
"None of us wants this future
for our kids," Mrs. Obama said
at the White House. "We have to
act, so let's move."
Her campaign has four parts:
helping parents make better food
choices, serving healthier food
in school vending machines and
lunch lines, making healthy food
more available and affordable,
and encouraging children to
exercise more.
The ambitious campaign,
which Mrs. Obama hopes will
be seen as her legacy, is aimed
at solving the childhood obesity
problem in a generation, so that
children born today can reach

adulthood at a healthy weight.
"This isn't like a disease
where we're still waiting for the
cure to be discovered. We know
the cure for this," Mrs. Obama
said at the unveiling, which was
moved to the State Dining Room
as the second blizzard in less
than a week bore down on the
city.
One major element of Mrs.
Obama's campaign is to have
the Food and Drug Administra-
tion to start working with food
manufacturers and retailers to
make food labels more "custom-
er-friendly." The nonalcoholic
beverage industry said yester-
day it will start putting calorie
information on the front of its
products.

Michigan schools
could face $420
million deficit
LANSING, Mich. (AP) - Gov.
Jennifer Granholm says she will
draw the line against further cuts
to education funding and restore
Michigan's main college scholar-
ship program.
But the Democratic governor
hasn't yet said how she plans
to pay for those proposals, and
Republicans say they will fight
back if she suggests tax increas-
es. That leaves some educators
skeptical about efforts to protect
funding as Michigan's latest bud-
get debate begins.
The governor and the Legisla-
ture must deal with a projected
$1.6 billion shortfall in the fiscal
year starting Oct. 1, including a
possible deficit of more than $420
million for Michigan schools.
Granholm's spokeswoman Liz
Boyd declined to discuss specif-
ics yesterday of the governor's
education funding proposals.
Details are expected Thursday
when Granholm presents her
final annual budget plan.
The governor already has pro-
posed an incentive program that
she hopes will coax about 39,000
eligible teachers and other public

school employees to retire. She
says it has the potential to save
schools about $230 million that
they could spend elsewhere. The
plan has been criticized by the
state's largest teachers union as
not providing enough financial
incentive for educators to leave
their jobs.
Education and social service
groups have urged the governor
and lawmakers to expand the
state sales tax to services, dedi-
cating some of the additional
revenue to schools. Some varia-
tions of the proposal call for cuts
to Michigan business taxes in
exchange for the broadened sales
tax. But many lawmakers in both
parties, including Republicans
who control the state Senate,
are likely to oppose changes that
could be billed as tax increases
- particularly in a big Michigan
election year.
"It's the old gridlock thing,"
said Tom Goodwin, chief finan-
cial officer for Grand Ledge
schools, located west of Lansing.
Grand Ledge is working on
a budget for next year based on
the possible reduction of up to
$268 per student. The district
could trim more than $4 million
from its budget by closing two
buildings, eliminating about 30
teaching jobs and making other
changes.


Russian military
calls U.S. miss~le'
defense a threat


Makarov's comments
are the strongest yet
about the U.S. plan
MOSCOW (AP) - U.S. missile
defense plans are a threat to Rus-
sian national security and have
slowed down progress on a new
arms control treaty with Washing-
ton, Russia's top military officer
said yesterday.
Gen. Nikolai Makarov said that
a revised U.S. plan to place missiles
in Europe undermines Russia's
national defense, rejecting Obama
administration promises that the
plan is not directed at his country.
"We view it very negatively,
because it could weaken our mis-
sile forces," Makarov, the chief
of the Russian military's General
Staff, said in televised remarks.
Makarov's comments are the
strongest yet on the revamped U.S.
missile effort and signal potential
new obstacles to an agreement on a
new nuclear arms reduction treaty

to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms
ReductionTreatythatexpiredDec.5.
The U.S. has insisted that the
missile defense plans should be
separate from talks to forge a new
agreement on cutting the two
nations' nuclear arsenals. Moscow
and Washington hoped that they
would sign a new treaty by the
end of December, but talks have
dragged on.
U.S. State Department spokes-
man P.J. Crowley told reporters
yesterday that U.S. missile defense
moves in Europe are a reaction to
Iran's missile threat and "are in no
way directed at Russia." He said
U.S. officials have been open about
missile defense plans and have
talked with Russian officials gen-
erally about the issue.
President Barack Obama's deci-
sion to scrap Bush administration
plans for missile defense sites
designed to shoot down long-range
missiles from rogue states such as
Iran drew praise from the Krem-
lin, which had fiercely opposed the
earlier plan as a threat.

Promises, promises
Granholm must ensure long-term funding for scholarship
We've heard promises from Gov. Jennifer Granholm
before. In her final State of the State address on Feb.
3, Granholm announced that Michigan's budget for
the 2011 fiscal year would include funding for the recently cut
Michigan Promise Scholarship. She didn't offer a specific plan,
but mentioned that "creative" funding would be incorporated into
the budget to account for the scholarship. However, considering
that original funding for the Promise was removed just two years
after the so-called "Promise" was made, it's difficult to believe
Granholm's assurance that the scholarship will be re-instated.
The governor and state legislature should adopt a sustainable
approach when formulating a new Promise Scholarship.

Our point was to draw attention to the
plight of Haitian orphans. We came here to help,
not to become the story."

regarding her case, as reported yesterday by The New York Times.

S

Mad Hatter's tea party

The Promise Scholarship was initially
established on Dec. 21, 2006. The merit-
based award provided $500 to $4,000 to stu-
dents who scored adequately on statewide
standardized tests and attended a two- or
four-year institution of higher learning. But
amid the state's $2.8 billion budget short-
fall, lawmakers cut the scholarship to save
approximately $140 million on Oct. 30,2009.
Though the scholarship was in the gover-
nor's initial budget proposal, she signed off
on the cut, saying, "Itis a budgetI don't agree
with and don't support," accordingto an Oct.
30 Detroit Free Press article.
Higher education is vital for Michigan to
pull itself out of the current recession. Mich-
igan's economy can't be supported by the
automotive industry anymore. It must shift
to a science- and technology-based economy.
To prepare the workforce for high-skill posi-
tions that technology businesses need to fill,
more students must attend institutions of
higher education. For that to happen, educa-
tion must be made accessible.
But despite its imprtance, education has
become less affordable. Here at the Pniver-
sity, tuition has increased by an alarming
52 percent since 2002, partially due to cuts
in state funding. Though the state is facing
serious deficit concerns, it shouldn't cut from

education funding. The rise in education
costs is made worse bythe struggling Michi-
gan economy, which has left many families
more dependent on scholarships. The Prom-
ise Scholarship is essential to students and
shouldn't have been cut in the first place.
The state has a projected 2011 deficit of
more than $1.6 billion, so a steady supply of
funding for the scholarship seems far from
assured. But if the state takes on the Prom-
ise Scholarship a second time, it would be
inexcusable to let it fail again, because for
some students, the difference could make
or break the viability of paying for college.
Reliable sources of funding must be secured
for the Promise so that it isn't cut soon after
its establishment, leaving thousands of stu-
dents without a resource that they count on.
Granholm's "creative," alternative funding
options should be explored to verify that
the new scholarship stays financially afloat
for more than a couple of years. Students
shouldn't be.guaranteed a significant schol-
arship only to have it taken away once again.
Granholm must back up her words with
decisive action to ensure that the legislature
passes a budget in 2011 that includes a realis-
tic plan to fund the Promise Scholarship. If
the state pledges funding for the scholarship
a second time, it must keep its Promise.

like parties, but hold the tea,
thank you.
Last week, the Tea Party
movement, a
series of far-right
protests oppos-
ing the agenda of
President Barack
Obama, gath-
ered in Nashville,
Tenn. for its first
national conven-
tion. You'd think
the convention TOMMASO
would promote PVN
"Limited Govern- PAVONE
ment, Free Speech,
the 2nd Amend-
ment, our Military,
Secure Borders and our Country," as
specified on the website of conven-
tion organizer Judson Phillips. But
that just wouldn't be radical enough,
would it?
The Tea Party Convention kicked
off with opening speaker Tom Tan-
credo, a former Republican con-
gressman from Colorado and 2008
presidential candidate. All was going
well... until Tancredo opened his
mouth. "People who could not even
spell the word 'vote' or say it in Eng-
lish put a committed socialist ideo-
logue in the White House," blasted
Tancredo. "His name is Barack Hus-
sein Obama."
Have you ever seen a better example
of ignorance, xenophobia and racism
all bound into one ugly package? And
perhaps more striking is the fact that
both of Tancredo's grandparents were
immigrants - I guess he must hate
them too. To top it off, Phillips pro-
ceeded to remark that "Tom Tancredo
gave a fantastic speech last night I
think he is an amazing politician."'
Phillips wasn't the only one who
endorsed Tancredo's hateful rhetoric

and the Tea Party's xenophobic mes-
sage. While delivering the keynote
speech at the convention, former
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin referred to
the Tea Party as a "beautiful move-
ment." When asked to comment fur-
ther, Palin said, "I believe there are
more of us than they (the media)
want us to believe." Isn't that a pleas-
ant thought?
In the end, it was beneficial for
voters to have Tancredo and Palin
speak so bluntly. Both speakers made
it clear that behind the Tea Party
movement's supposed love for "our
Country" is a hateful, xenophobic,
racist ideology unfit for American
democracy. The Tea Partiers love
America, just not the 12.5 percent of
the American population that recent
U.S. Census Bureau statistics say
is foreign-born. In the end, the Tea
Party movement is not a manifesta-
tion of American independence. It is
a disgrace.
We can't expect the Tea Partiers
to moderate their rhetoric - if they
do, how else could they remain real-
ly ignorant and angry? But what we
can, and should, expect is that our
Michigan politicians denounce the
movement, or at least refrain from
associating with it.
Yet many of our local representa-
tives seem to be doing the opposite.
On Sunday, Michigan Rep. Pete Hoek-
stra (R-Holland), who is running for
governor, attended a Tea Party gath-
ering and reported on his Twitter,
that it was a "great group." Michigan
Attorney General Mike Cox, also a.
Republican running for governor,
characterized the Tea Party move-
ment as "remarkable." Last, but cer-
tainly not least, is Oakland County
Sheriff Mike Bouchard, another
Republican contender for Michigan's
governorship, who recently attend-

ed a Tea Party protest outside Cobo
Expo Center in Detroit to "show his
solidarity," as the Detroit Free Press
reported on Jan.11.
Michigan leaders
shouldn't buy
into ignorance.
We shouldn't 'tolerate that our
local elected officials endorse the Tea
Party message. This is especially true
of those seeking our state's governor-
ship. If we truly believe in freedom,
human rights, civil rights and diver-
sity, then we have a moral obligation
to hold our representatives account-
able when they endorse contradicto-
ry principles. While we can't prevent
the Tea Party movement from diffus-
ing an ideology riddled with hatred,
we can certainly question our elected
officials if they endorse a xenophobic
movement. I can't imagine that most
Michiganders share the Tea Party's
radical message, and since Michi-
gan's politicians are supposed to rep-
resent our views, neither should they.
It's one thing to have differing
political views. It's quite another to
endorse a movement that reveres
Tancredo's Tea Party convention
speech. If Hoekstra, Cox and Boucha-
rd are unable to understand this prin-
ciple on their own, then perhaps we
should remind them. By writing let-
ters, perhaps. By calling their offices,
most certainly. By voting for them?
I'd have a cup of tea and think that

This is my first semester as stu-

of Education. The plan is to

when this whole
college thing is
over. Like all first- ;
semester teacher '
candidates, I've
been placed in
the first teaching ,
practicum course,
which is basically RACHEL
pre-student teach-
ing. It's a course in VAN GILDER
observation dur -_______
ing which teacher
candidates watch certified teachers
in schools around Ann Arbor.
I've been placed at Southfield High
School, which is north of Detroit. So
far, as I expected it would be, the
observation has been educational and
informative. But one of the most valu-
able learning experiences I am hav-
ing isn't one that I expected. That's
because the student body of South-
field High School is overwhelmingly
African American. For the three
hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays
that I observe at Southfield High
School, I am in the minority. And
it's led to some startling realizations
about race issues.
Let me be entirely ,dear upfront:
I do not judge people on the color of
their skin. Race does not determine the
quality of a person. But race, like cul-
ture or ethnicity, is part of who a per-
son is, and it shouldn't be ignored. At
the same time, I've always experienced
race issues as a member of the majority.
I come from a place where diversity
is just a word. Almost without excep-
tion, the population of Webberville,
Michigan is white and Christian.
Even here at the University, I'm part
of the majority. And let's face it: It's

easy to be the same as everyone else,
because you never even think about
what being different means. And up
until this point in my life, I've never
been the only person in the room who
is different. I've never even really
been in a situation that I had to think
about what that must be like.
But during my observation days
at Southfield High School, I am
not the same as everyone else, and
that's a drastic departure from what
I'm accustomed to. The school is
about 97-percent African American,
according to this year's enrollment
numbers, and so some of the classes I
sit in on don't have any white students
in them. The teacher I'm observ-
ing is African American as well. It's
strange to.suddenly be the one person
in the room who is different. And, to
be completely honest, being differ-
ent made me a little uncomfortable
at first. The discomfort isn't because
the students are black and I'm white
- it's because they are one way, and
I am another. And being so notica-
bly different is something I've never
experienced before.
At first, I was extremely self-con-
scious. I was irrationally sure that the
kids were judging me every second.
Admittedly, some of this was because
I am in a new position of author-
ity as an almost-teacher when I still
don't consider myself a real adult.
It's a jarring transition. But some of
it was because I wondered what the
students thought of the white woman
sitting in the back of their classroom.
The whole thing was compounded by
the awkwardness of being an outside
observer, which is a strange position
to be in. This soon faded - thank
goodness - after I realized that I
was going to have to get over it or
spend the rest of the semester feeling
uncomfortable.
I don't want to imply that the

students have treated me poorly or
excluded me because of my race. In
fact, now that my initial paranoia has
passed, I'm fairly certain that they
haven't thought about it at all. But I
still feel the difference of being the
one on the outside of the cultural
bubble.
For the first time,
I was the one who
was different.
I'm not trying to say that this
experience has suddenly made me
completely understand what it's like
to be a minority in America. I don't.
My experience is only temporary. I
instantly become a member of the
majority group again as soon as I
leave Southfield High School after a
mere three hours a day, twice a week.
I don't know what it means to be a
racial minority, and I probably never
will. But the experience has given me
a little bit of perspective on an issue
with which I haven't had much first-
hand experience.
It's the variety of experience and
the perspective it brings that makes
the teaching practicum valuable,
especially for brand-new teacher
candidates like me. I'm not a minor-
ity, and I'll probably never fully
understand what it's like to be one.
But I have had a taste - albeit a small
taste - of what it's like, and hopefully
that will give me a little bit of empa-
thy in the future and help make me a
better teacher and person.

'85 team reminds Blue
of storied dominance

SAMANTHA TRAUBEN/Daily
Junior Louie Caporusso scored two goals in Thursday's 4-0 shutout of Bowling Green. Last year, Caporusso led the team in scoring last year with 24 goals at season's end.
Caporusso' surge gets Michigan going
in second half of series with Falcons

Snapping out of his
recent scoring slump,
Caporusso keeps 'M'
in contention
By MARK BURNS
Daily Sports Editor
For the first time in recent mem-
ory, Louie was being Louie.
Junior forward Louie Caporus-
so, the Woodbridge, Ont. native,
registered the Michigan hockey
team's first two goals in its 4-0 vic-
tory over Bowling Green last night
at Yost Ice Arena.
It had been 368 days since
Caporusso's last multi-goal per-
formance, and it came at a most
opportune time, as Michigan con-
tinues to vie for a top spot in the
CCHA conference.
"(Louie) has played really hard
in recent games since Christmas,"
said Michigan coach Red Beren-
son who, with the win, moved
into sixth place all-time with 690
NCAA wins. "Even before Christ-
mas, he was one of our best for-

wards in the Notre Dame series,
so you see him battling and trying
hard.
"... And now some of the bounc-
es are coming his way."
Up until last night, Caporusso
had just seven goals on the season,
a far cry from last season's team-
leading 24.
It's been an uphill battle all year
trying to get his name on the score
sheet.
With 13 minutes left in the
second period against the Fal-
cons, Caporusso spun away from
a Bowling Green defender on the
half boards.
He then made a sharp cut to the
slot and threw the puck five-hole
past netminder Andrew Ham-
mond.
Caporusso said if he could fig-
ure out what was different about
his play last night, he'd "bottle it up
and just take itbefore every game."
Later in the third, junior defen-
seman Chad Langlais corralled the
puck at the top of the Falcon left
circle and fired a pass to Caporusso
on the weak side, who then depos-
ited the puck past a sprawled-out
Hammond.
The two-goal output was the

type of showing Berenson need-
ed from his former Hobey Baker
finalist, who will need to shoulder
much of the scoring if the team
expects to garner some late-sea-
son success.
"I think what happens when
"Now some of
the bounces are
coming his way"
you're not scoring, you start over-
passing the puck," Berenson said.
"And I've had to remind Louie that
he's got to start shooting the puck.
I think he's in a good place right
now. He's making good decisions
with the puck."
Along with Caporusso's First-
Star Honor performance, the
Wolverines (12-9-1 CCHA, 17-13-1
overall) played lockdown defense
on the Falcons all night, allowing
just 21 shots.

The Wolverine defensemen
closed the gap on the Bowling
Green forwards, minimizing
the speed they gained coming
through the neutral zone and into
the attacking zone. Additionally,
it minimized the number of odd-
man rushes throughout the entire
contest.
But midway through the third
period, with the Wolverines up
2-0, a Falcon offender went one-
on-one with junior goaltender
Bryan Hogan.
Senior defenseman Steven
Kampfer trailed on the play and
at the last split second, lifted the
player's stick and reversed the
puck back down the ice.
While it wasjust one minor play,
the defensive maneuver from the
veteran blue-liner prevented the
Falcons (3-15-4-3, 4-20-4) from
potentially scoring in what was at
that point a very close game.
The win gave Hogan his fourth
shutout of the season.
"The goals were really pre-
cious tonight," Berenson said.
"Fortunately, we found a way
to score. But it was pretty good
team defense, we didn't give them
much."

By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily Sports Editor
Even the Fab Five couldn't do it.
Nor could any of the other Mich-
igan men's basketball teams of the
past 24 years - it's that elusive.
The last Michigan squad to win a
Big Ten title was the 1985-86 team,
which had also won the champion-
ship the yearbefore.
"(Winning a conference title) is
a hell of an accomplishment," then-
head coach Bill Frieder said on Sat-
urday at a reception for the 1984-85
team held before the Michigan-
Wisconsin game.
Frieder was back in town for
the reunion, and with him came a
handful of players, including one of
the most prolific guards in Michi-
gan history. The 1984-85 team
owns the program's all-time high-
est winning percentage with a 26-4
final record.
Grant, who was a freshman on
the 1984-85 team that had justwon
an NIT championship the previous
year, didn't remember being too
nervous playing as a freshman.
"I knew they had a great team
and (needed) a couple more pieces,"
Grant said Saturday. "We had an
opportunity to go far, possibly win
the Big Ten title and go deep in the
NCAA tournament."
Grant recalled one of the main
reasons he chose to come to Michi-
gan: a chance to play with Antoine
Joubert, nicknamed The Judge.
"My nickname was The Gener-
al," Grant said. "The Judge and The
General - it made sense to me."
It worked on the court, too. At
Saturday's reception, Frieder called
Grant the "glue" that held the team
together, and the way Grant flowed
fromformerteammatetoteammate
at the reunion lunch, it seemed that
he still fits that role these days.
Grant says he watches Michigan
games whenever he can, and that
he engages in some friendly ban-
ter with his friends who went to
UCLA. Grant even addressed the
current Wolverines after they lost
to Wisconsin on Saturday, saving a
few key pieces of advice for another
freshman pointguard, Darius Mor-
ris.
He said the biggest thing he
notices is that this year's players
need to keep their heads up even if
they're losing. "Once they do that,
they'llbe back on track," Grantsaid.

Other former Wolverines
enjoyed being back in Ann Arbor
for Saturday's game, too.
"These times (at Michigan) were
probably the most special times
of my career," said Joubert, who
played in Venezuela, Argentina, the
Philippines, France, Belgium and
Poland after his days in Ann Arbor.
"I tellmy kids, 'College, that's mem-
ories and friends that you'll have for
life.' A lot of good memories here."
Joubert said the Big Ten champi-
onships were his fondest memories,
and they keep him connected with
his teammates even now, more than
two decades later.
"That's your goal, as a team, to
win these championships," he said.
The man who led them to the
back-to-back conference cham-
pionships and also assembled the
1989 NCAA Championship squad,
Frieder, is now retired from coach-
ing. But he was thrilled to catch up
withhis former players and recount
the years before he left Michigan
for Arizona State. He now runs an
annual skateboarding competition,
broadcasts games and runs basket-
ball camps.
But he doesn't miss coaching.
"No, no," Frieder said. "I got out
13 years ago and had done it for 32
years. That's a long grind. When
I got out, the first month I had so
much fun not doing it. Spent time
watching my daughter grow up and
spent time with my family, do what
I want to do, and I knew I would
never go back into coaching."
Frieder feels the role of a college
head coach has changed, and it's
not something that appeals to him
much anymore.
"You know, when I started
coaching at Michigan as an assis-
tant it was 90 percent coaching and
10 percent everything else. Now it's
10 percent coaching and 90 percent
everything else with the NCAA
and the recruiting and all the riff-
raff, second, third and fourth par-
ties that you've got to deal with in
recruiting and all the problems
today, it's so much different."
The one thing that remains the
same, though, is how glamorous a
Big Ten Championship is. Frieder's
two helped put the Michigan bas-
ketball program back on the map.
The players from the 1984-85 team
would love to see the Wolverines
win another, and get back to the
prominence they knew so well.

RETRIAL
From Page1A
While five witnesses agreed that
it was a Chevy, and three of the five
said it was a Caprice Classic four-
door sedan, two witnesses were
unsure of the model but said that it
was a grey color.
Brett DeGroff, second-year Law
student and Innocence Clinic stu-
dent attorney, said the two recent
developments -the "factual devel-
opment" of the newly-discovered
documents citing witnesses and
the likelihood that Wiley's testi-
mony from the first trial cannot be
used - are key to keeping Provi-
ence from being put back in jail.
Witness Jannie Halliburton
testified that she was behind the
shooters' grey vehicle and saw part
of the license plate number.
"I don't remember the letters,
but I remember 734," Halliburton
said in a police statement.
The Innocence Clinic obtained
documentation from the prosecu-

tion in December 2009 - filed on
April 26, 2002 - that lists cars
owned by Antrimone Mosley, one
of the Mosley brothers linked to
Hunter's murder and two other
murders unrelated to Provience's
case, according to police officer
progress notes.
The newly-obtained document
states that Mosley owned a 1985
four-door Chevy Caprice Classic
with the license plate 7CXM34
during the time of Hunter's mur-
der, and the Vehicle Identification
Number classifies the vehicle as
grey.
In November, Detroit police
officer William Ashford told pros-
ecutors that evidence points to the
Mosley family and not Provience.
Ashford's investigation revealed
the murders of Detroit residents
Courtney Irving and Maurice
"Bangy" Sutherland were linked
to Hunter's homicide in 2000 and
that all three had some connection
to the Mosley family.
Students in the Innocence
Clinic are arguing that the Mos-

leys killed Hunter because the
Mosleys suspected Hunter stole
their trailer full of marijuana. The
students allege the Mosleys mur-
dered Irving a month later because
Irving knew that the Mosleys shot
Hunter. Sutherland was murdered
a few months later when the Mos-
leys also suspected him of stealing
the trailer.
David Moran, co-director of the
Innocence Clinic at the University,
said the Innocence Clinic has filed
discovery motions to gain access
to Irving and Sutherland's homi-
cide files, but the prosecution has
yet to give the documents to the
students.
"We've asked for them, and
we've hit a stone wall," Moran
said.
Robyn Goldberg, second-year
Law student and Innocence Clinic
student attorney, said if the prose-
cution does not give the requested
documents to the Innocence Clin-
ic, the clinic will request that the
judge order them to do so during a
hearing scheduled for March 5.

MSA President Abhishek Mahanti (third from left) and MSA Vice President Mike Rorro (second from left) at last night's MSA
meeting. The assembly passed a resolution in support of the Medical Amnesty Act.
Assembly worked with MSU

From Page 1A
quences for students who want-
ed to help intoxicated friends
receive medical attention.
Because of the MAP at Cor-
nell University, MSA's resolution
* said that there were significant
increases in the number of "alco-
hol-related calls for assistance to
emergency medical services."
t The resolution also stated
that "students were less likely to
report fear of getting an intoxi-
cated person in trouble as a bar-
rier to calling for help."
Jason Raymond, chair of the
External Relations Commit-
tee, said the Ann Arbor Police
Department is sometimes a deter-
rent for students who want to call
an ambulance for a friend but are
intimidated by the police.
TESTING .
From PageA 
University alum Rod Gailes OBC
worked with Littlejohn on the proj-
ect and the two decided to continue
their collaboration after seeing the
success of the event. Of those that
attended the event, 10 percent got
tested for HIV/AIDS on the spot,
according to Littlejohn.
OBC, a graduate of New York
University's film program, said he
was eager to sign on to extend the
project because it fits in with most
of his other art, which aims to pro-
mote social change.
"A big thing for me," OBC said,
"is being an artist for social change,
so my work ... needs to have that
kind of thrust."
Littlejohn said one of the reasons
hebelievesthecampaignissoimpor-
tant is that students don't appreciate
thevalue ingettingtested.
"People our age live (with) this
kind of carefree, I'm invincible
attitude," he said, "so they don't
really take the time to think about
the risks they're taking."
He added that getting tested
isn't going to change the results of
the test.
"Going to get the test isn't going
to make (the results) positive or
negative," he said.

"The Ann Arbor police con-
tinually tell us that they are not
trying to prey on students," Ray-
mond said. "The problem is that
perception exists. Students fear
the police."
According to MSA's resolution,
if House Bill 4867 is passed, the
Michigan Liquor Control Code

ing an MIP if they call 911.
Raymond, a Business School
junior, said the bill is not a way
for students to beat the criminal
justice system. Instead, he said
the act would benefit the lives of
University students.
"It is something that a lot of
students care about," Raymond
said. "The bill isn't a get-out-of-
jail-free card for students that
like to have fun. It's more of a

safety measure."
Raymond said collaboration
with MSU's student government
helped get massive support from
the Michigan House of Represen-
tatives. He said lobbying efforts
toward state Senate approval
might be slow because MSA's
relationship with the Michigan
Senate Committee on Judiciary
is just beginning.
Steven Zuckerman, chair of
MSA's Students Rights Commis-
sion, said the passing of the act
will reiterate a "good Samaritan
policy."
"It's about being a good citi-
zen, a good friend," Zucker-
man said. "That legally you are

said.


OBC agreed, saying that stu-
dents won't be able to deal with
their status without knowing what
it is. f.
"Knowing your tatus isn't
going change your status," he said.
It's going to make you powerful in
dealing with it."
Through the P2 Initiative, Lit-
tlejohn and OBC said they want to
help students realize that getting
tested for HIV is important not
only for health reasons, but also for
the empowerment that comes with
"knowing your status."
Every week through April 13,
the P2 Initiative will release a new
image portraying confident Uni-
versity students engaged in every-
day activities like a late-night study
date. The images will feature infor-
mation about free and anonymous
HIV testing available every Tues-
day from 6 to 7 p.m. in the MESA
office in the Michigan Union.
LittlejohnandOBCsaidtheywant-
ed each of the 10 campaign images
to tell a story, and they recruited a
diverse group of University students
as models so all students would find
the stories relatable.
OBC shot the photographs dur-
ing a weeklong stay in Michigan in
November. He said he designed the
images with the aim that the mod-
els would exude confidence.
OBC added that he wants the

images to function like advertise-
ments for HIV/AIDS testing and to
make students feel like they"want to
buy what (the images are) selling."
In addition to encouraging stu-
dents to get tested, the P2 Initiative
offers a different type of testing
than what is normally available at
UHS. While the results could nor-
mally take up to two weeks, stu-
dents who get tested at MESA will
only have to wait 20 minutes to be
informed of the results of the test.
Littlejohn said the system in
place at UHS, which involved going
to get tested and then returning to
get results, can often be discourag-
ing for students.
"They get the nerve to go the
first time," he said. "But then they
have to get the nerve again to call
back or go back."
Before the P2 Initiative, Little-
john said, Detroit was the clos-
est place where rapid testing was
available. He added that getting
funding to bring it to the Universi-
ty was difficult because Ann Arbor
was not a "high risk" area, but the
P2 Initiative eventually got the
funding through the Washtenaw
County Health Department.
The first testing session took
place on Feb. 2 - the same day as the
release of the first image of the cam-
paign. Four people got tested in that
first hour, according to Littlejohn.

markets will begin accepting a
wider variety of materials, which
means that people living in Ann
Arbor will be able torecycle more.
In addition to changing the
recycling system, the partnership
also focuses on educating students
and residents about recycling
guidelines.
With a national increase in the
recycling initiative, Pyle said she is
hopeful students will take the time
to learn about recycling guidelines
and recycle more.
As part of the effort, Pyle has vis-
ited Alpha Epsilon Phi sorority and

will soon be speaking to Lambda
Chi Alpha fraternity. She said the
program is focused on promot-
ing recycling in off-campus hous-
ing locations, because recycling is
already readily accessible for stu-
dents living in residence halls.
Students living off-campus in
houses, apartments, co-ops or
Greek houses often have to go out
of their way to recycle, Pyle said.
Therefore, many students choose
to just throw away their waste
into the trash, when in fact, a large
majority of their products can be
recycled, Pyle said.
"Ihave been arecycling advocate
since I was a little kid. My family
always supported recycling," Pyle
said. "When houses off-campus

request services, I tell them why it
is important to recycle and why we
care about recycling."
Any student living in off-cam-
pus housing can request recycling
bins, according to Pyle. Michigan
Students Advocating Recycling, a
student organization on campus, is
allowing students to pick up recy-
cling bins at certain locations.
Pyle said it is important to make
sure recycled items end up in the
right place, which is one of the rea-
sons why educating students and
residents is so important.
"We want to make sure our col-
lected recyclables have an end use,"
Pyle said. "We do not want the
products to be shipped overseas
and be burned to produce fuel."

Size matters in the post
for Michigan's future

0

With Phillips leaving,
Borseth will be forced to
retool Blue's post attack
It's a team with all the pieces for the
future.
Well, at least it's pretty close.
Understandably, the long-term future
a hot topic of discussion for the Michigan
women's basketball
team, considering their
biggest game of the year ALEX
is against Michigan State HERMANN
on Thursday. The Wol- On Women's
verines are attempting to Basketball
break out of the middle B
of the Big Ten pack in
hopes of obtaining an NCAA Tournament
berth.
But rest assured, discussion of the future is
entirely relevant for this team.
Michigan senior center Krista Phillips and
Spartan senior center Allyssa DeHaan, both
graduating after this year, will face off for the
last time.
At 6-foot-6 and 6-foot-9, respectively,
that's a whole lot of size in the middle for
both teams.
And for the Wolverines especially, that
brings up questions regarding the future out-
look for the team down low.
With two starting freshman guards, Day-
eesha Hollins and Jenny Ryan, Michigan is
certainly set on the perimeter. But there's an
entirely different story being written in the
post.
Outside of redshirt senior forward Ashley
Jones, who is also graduating after this year,
the Wolverines have only a pair of freshmen
to back up Phillips in the post.
But Sam Arnold and Rachel Sheffer aver-
age just 10 minutes per game combined on
the season and even fewer in Big Ten games,
leavingthe team with few seasoned post play-
ers for next year.
The two freshmen will be joined by 2010
signee Val Driscoll. The 6-foot-4 center's
adjustment to the college game, along with

Arnold and Sheffer's continued growth, will
be crucial on the interior.
"Solidifying your game around the rim is
obviously very important," Borseth said tues-
day. "In this league, you got to be able to stop
somebody around the hole. That's what you
got to be able to do, and if you can't do that
then life becomes more difficult."
And filling Phillips's shoes in the post is cru-
cial to Michigan's success beyond this season.
But the Wolverine post players may have a
luxury not afforded to players in the past. The
up-tempo style that Michigan has adopted
emphasizes outside shooting and perimeter
play. But this adjustment may simply be a
result of the personnel.
Despite Phillips's obvious size, she and
sophomore forward Carmen.Reynolds are
both more comfortable on the perimeter
than in the paint. In the team's 74-40 win
against Minnesota on Sunday, Phillips
scored all 13 of her points on jumpshots.
Reynolds is Michigan's leading 3-point
shooter, hitting 44 percent on her team-
leading 52 triples.
But for Phillips, the biggest adjustment
to playing the post in a physical Big Ten has
been defense.
"It's a mentality that you don't ever, ever
want to get beat," Phillips said. "That's my
biggest thing. I don't ever want to have some
post player come in and just score a post move
on me."
But that mentality isn't easily achieved,
and only after the team's young post players
fully understand that can the Wolverines
turn a bright-looking future into a potentially
dominant reality.
"If you can stop people and you can
rebound, then you canrun," Borseth said.
"Your best teams are your teams that can
just stuff people, and then just break out and
create something fast on the other end of the
court. We're not in a position to impose our
will on anybody."
The Wolverines have at least one half of
that equation - those guards sure can get out
and run. The other half?
That's the question that will define Michi-
gan's future.

Wolverines take
12th place in early
spring tourney

Bauer sisters tie for
first place on team,
Meagan tallies a 72
in first round
By KEVIN RAFTERY
Daily Sports Writer
There was abundant sunshine,
temperatures in the 80s and three
rounds of golf at one of Puerto
Rico's finest resorts. A paradise
for most.
But for the Michigan women's
golf team, it was just the start of a
new spring season.
The Wolverines traveled to
Rio Grande, Puerto Rico this
past Sunday through Tuesday
for the three-round Lady Puerto
Rico Classic at the par-72 Trump
International Golf Club.
Unfortunately for Michigan,
the results of the tournament
were not quite as pretty as the
weather.
Competing in a field loaded
with 10 of the nation's top-50 pro-
grams, the Wolverines finished in
12th place out of 16 teams, with a
final team score of 925.
"Overall, I am a little disap-
pointed in the way we finished
today," Michigan coach Cheryl
Stacy said yesterday.
It was Michigan's first com-
petitive outing since Nov. 2 and 3,
when it posted a team score of 877
at the Challenge at Onion Creek in
Austin, Texas.
Clearly, there is some rust that
needs to be shaken off for this
spring season.
"We were alittle rusty, not hav-
ing played outside," Stacy said,
"but it was a good experience for
us early in the spring."
But it wasn't all gloom for the
Wolverines.
Sophomore Meagan Bauer
posted rounds of 72-73-78 for a

tournament total of 223, the best
54-hole total of her young career.
Bauer's first round of 72 was
just her second career round. of
par or better - and most certainly
the second of many to come. She
has improved her score in each of
her last five tournaments.
Bauer tied her sister, senior
.captain Ashley Bauer, for first on
the team and 17th overall.
A first-place team finish is
nothing new for Ashley.
She has finished as the top
Wolverine in 25 of her 42 career
events, and she has the lowest
career scoring average in the his-
tory of Michigan women's golf
with an average of 75.98.
There's no doubt, she will be
expected to carry much of the
load for the Wolverines the rest of
the way this season.
Michigan also got an oppor-
tunity to see how it would fare
against fellow Big Ten teams.
Purdue, Northwestern, Wis-
consin, Indiana and Penn State all
competed in the Lady Puerto Rico
Classic. The Wolverines finished
fourth out of the six teams, edging
out Indiana and Penn State.
"It would have been nice to play
a little better in the final round
and catch some teams and get a
couple more wins over some Big
Ten teams," Stacy said.
Fourth-ranked Purdue finished
as the top Big Ten team, earning
second place with a final tally of
883. Alabama won the tourna-
ment with a score of 872.
As the spring season begins in
full force, Michigan will look to
continue to move up the ranks in
the Big Ten as it prepares for the
Big Ten Championships in April.
"We just have to work hard-
er and improve upon what we
learned this tournament," Stacy
said. "I know that we are looking
forward to getting back down to
Florida in a few weeks."

The directors of Walgreen Drama Center
the plays, Amanda Free
Cohen for "Civili-

Both plays deal with the analysis of

"The teacher (in 'Civilization'), Tess
McCormack, comes into the class and
makes impossible demands of her stu-
dents," Cohen said. "Her reasoning is
that if the students of her top honors
class will do anything for an appeas-
ing grade, then there is nothing to say
about their future. It discusses what we,
as human beings, will do to survive and
rise to the top."
"('Waiting') is kind of an uncomfort-
able comedy. It is funny but it is not 'in

be sure when they should laugh," Kelley

ARTS IN BRIEF
LECTURE PREVIEW
Burnside cooks
up a reading
Zel Visiting Writers Series:
John Burnside
Tomorrow at 5:15 p.m.
Helmut Stern Auditorium
Free
Like the restaurant business, in
which it's difficult to consistently
prepare scrumptious meals for all
three meals, in the literary world,
it's rare to see a writer achieve
excellence in the literary trifecta
of fiction, nonfiction and poetry.
This is why writers like John
Burnside are like the master chefs
of literature. The renowned Scot-
tish author and poet will visit the
Helmut Stern Auditorium tomor-
row as part of the Department
of English Program in Creative
Writing's Zell Visiting Writers
Series, which brings established
writers to the University of Mich-
igan Museum of Art throughout
the school year.
In the last 10 years alone,
Burnside has proven himself a
prolific contributor to literature.
He has written 11 books of poet-
ry (the most recent being "The
Hunt in the Forest"), a collection
of short stories titled "Burning
0 Elvis," seven novels including
"The Devil's Footprints" and

"Glister" and a memoir. His
extensive body of work has been
recognized with several awards,
including Saltire Book of the Year
and Scottish Arts Council Non-
Fiction Book of the Year for "A
Lie About My Father," the Geof-
frey Faber Memorial Prize and
the Whitbread Poetry Award.
Adding another feather to his
cap, Burnside works as a Profes-
sor of English at the University of
St. Andrews. As an accomplished
writer and teacher, Burnside
should present a reading that's
both informative and inspiring.
Potential attendees should come
prepared to be served a delicious
helping of fiction, nonfiction and
poetry.

and prolonged inevitability of fate. We're
tryingto capture the emotional state and
the journey of this character through his
unfortunate circumstances."
The freshmen directors were influ-
enced by bigger and overarching ideas.
Cohen said her play addresses the
cyclical nature of history.
"History unfortunately repeats itself,
and if we can't learn from our past mis-
takes then we're not going to progress in
the future," Cohen said.
"On a more positive note, I want the
audience to enjoy themselves, laugh
and connect with the characters. Even
though the moral is bleak, it's really
funny and sassy, and I hope they enjoy
it," she added.
Presenting a play that deals with the
complexity of purgatory, Kelley has
learned about life throughout his directo-
rial efforts with "Waiting" and has been
able to apply that knowledge to how to
present "life" in a theatrical setting.
"In theater you get to watch people
interact with each other, and deconstruct
human behavior right in front of you. You
learn to appreciate what you miss out on
everyday, which are those little moments
between people," Kelley said.
Cohen has unparalleled insight into
the "Civilization" script, as she knows
the author personally.
"The playwright's name is Mark
Kaufman. He lives in Los Angeles and
does commercial work and script writ-
ing," Cohen said. "He's a family friend.
His father knows my stepfather because
they work together. When I was young,
he gave me inspiration to pursue direct-
ing by letting me read a bunch of plays
and then asking my opinion of them."
Kelley discovered his script inadver-
tently, but itcomes from a big name which
could add some pressure to do itejustice.
"'Waiting' is written by Ethan Coen,
one of the Coen brothers, who has
directed a .lot of famous productions,"
Kelley explained. "I was just in Borders

one day and I saw it in the play section,
in a compilation named 'Almost in Eve-
ning.' I thought it would be a short and
challenging piece, as the characters have
very little back stories."
As freshmen, both directors have
found that actually being in the direc-
tor's chair is quite a challenge.
"It's interesting dealing with obstacles
as they come and trying to rebound. I've
learned that if you fix it as fast as you can,
it'll be alright," Cohen said. "Dealing with
the various technical aspects of the show,
it kind of gets you frazzled but you have
to know it's goingto work out in the end."
But despite their youth, Cohen and
Kelley feel they have enough relevant
experience to make successful college
debuts.
"This is the first show I've directed,
but I've associate choreographed 'Hair'
through the company MUSKET, and
assistant directed 'Orpheus Descend-
ing' through Rude Mechanicals," Cohen
said. "I did alot of directing and choreo-
graphing in high school, because I used
to be on a varsity dance team."
"I directed two short shows by
Edward Albee called 'The Zoo Story'
and 'The American Dream,' " Kelley
said. "I'm from Ann Arbor, and I never
really thought I would go to U of M. I
always knew I wanted to study theater,
but found out that Michigan has one of
the only undergrad programs with a
directing concentration and I found that
interesting. Everyone works extremely
hard here and wants to see each other do
well. I think that's why the program has
such a good reputation."
When it all comes together, Kelley
wants audiences to enjoy themselves,
but also to leave the show having discov-
ered something about the way we live.
"I hope by watching our show, the
audience can come out realizing not nec-
essarily something about themselves,
but something about human nature and
how we live with each other," he said.

performance will focus on a discussion of his
one true love: aphorisms.
"A lot of people find the word a bit strange,"
Geary said. "When people ask me what I do
and I say 'I write books about aphorisms,'
they say 'Oh that's fascinating, fascinating
... what's an aphorism?' And then I say: It's a
short, witty philosophical saying like 'I never
let school interfere with my education' - and
then everyone knows immediately what it is."
Other aphorisms Geary includes on his
website jamesgeary.com include "In a crisis,
inspiration is better than consolation," "Too
many facts spoil the plot" and "Never be seri-
ous in public."
Geary's love affair with what he calls the
world's "oldest written art form" began at
the tender age of eight years old, when he dis-
covered his first aphorisms on the Quotable
Quotes page of Reader's Digest. Ever since, he
has been enamored with these short, potent
phrases and would go on to have a career as a
journalist and an author of two books on apho-
risms: "The World ina Phrase: A Brief History

aphori'sm
of the Aphorism," which made the New York
Times Best Seller List, and "Geary's Guide to
the World's Great Aphorists."
"People always say 'Do what you love,' and
for me that certainly turned out to be a good
decision," Geary said.
Geary explained that his connection to this
type of literature stems from the accessibility
and relevance of the form.
"Aphorisms contain important informa-
tion," he said. "And they contain, although it
sounds cliche, wisdom that helps us lead our
lives, helps us get through crises and helps
us celebrate when we have something to cel-
ebrate."
Geary plans to engage the audience with
personal anecdotes about experiences with
aphorisms and how they have helped to
change his life. He believes that aphorisms
are a "social form of literature," and that this
directly contributes to the success and lon-
gevity of the art form. Although people read
aphorisms alone, the words are most vital and

living when applied to experiences in every-
day life and shared with others.
"Aphorisms are special because they're one
of the few forms of literature that is still part
of the oral tradition, that people still exchange
in daily life," Geary said.
Geary's obsession with aphorisms may
seem disconnected from everyday life and
from much of the arts, but this kind of creative
niche is exactly what the Penny W. Stamps
lecture series is all about.

COACHES
from Page 7B
For Yasa and Yuri, that means cre-
ating programs that highlight the
personalities of their students and
listening to advice coming from the
international Skating Union.
When Yasa heard that the ISU
was "moving in a direction away
from the depressing and dying piec-
es of the free dance" that dominat-
ed the sport for years, they selected
the romantic "Canto Della Terra"
for what they hoped would be Bates
and Samuelson's first Olympic free
dance. It has been a successful pro-
gram, as it secured their place on
the Olympic team at the national
championships last month.
It's the partnership between
teams Bates-Samuelson and Yasa-
Yuri that has put the Ann Arbor
Figure Skating Club on the map.
Samuelson and Bates's unique pre-
"entations of the programs that Yasa
and Yuri tailor to fit their personali-
ties and highlight their skating have
garnered international attention in
the short amount of time they have
been competing at the senior level.
The drive forward has brought the
team to achieve what Bates calls
"the greatest sports dream."
"I think a lot of the supporting
comes from each other and a lot of
the pushing comes from the coach-

es," Alexis Bates, Evan Bates' sister
said in a phone interview last week.
"The end is the same. They are the
same. They are one team. It's not
Bates or Samuelson. It's Bates and
Samuelson."
Precocious as they are, Samu-
elson and Bates will soak up this
first Olympic experience, knowing
that their youth grants them the
possibility of future Olympic trips
- at least two more would not be
out of the question. As they close
this chapter of their short careers,
a unique opportunity sits on the
horizon for Yasa and Yuri and their
proteges.
In four years time, the best ice
dancers in the world will travel to
Sochi, Russia for the 2014 Winter
Olympics. Following the Vancouver
games, Samuelson and Bates will
again begin preparing for a future
Olympic medal bid. The possibility
of taking skaters back to Russia for
the games raises complicated emo-
tions for their coaches.
"We both feel like very new citi-
zens," Yasa said. "We're both very
excited to be United States citizens,.
but also we have Russian roots. I
think it would be great to go back
to Russia and bring the results of
our work from so many years and
to compete against the coaches that
we trained with and the skaters that
we skated with. It would be a won-
derful experience for us."

ICE DANCING
From Page 5B
White points to the "significantly
higher" scores he and Davis had
earned compared with Belbin and
Agosto in non head-to-head com-
petitions. On top of that, Davis
stresses that being U.S. Champions
is more important than beating any
specific team.
"Going into international com-
petition as your country's top
team is more important than beat-
ing Tanith and Ben," she said. "It
really makes a difference to the
judges from other countries to hear
us introduced as the U.S. national
champions instead of just U.S. No.
2. And when you're going up against
the national champions from Rus-
sian and Canada, it was really
important to establish ourselves at
the top of our country."
Over the last two generations,
American ice dancing had been
slowly gaining respect in a sport
dominated by Russian teams. In
2006, when Belbin and Agosto won
their Olympic silver medals, it had
been 30 years since the United
States had last won an Olympic
medal in ice dancing.
Still, no American has ever won
the Olympic gold, leaving the door
wide open for Davis and White to
make history.

The sheer magnitude of the
world stage at the Olympics is both
the most exciting and slightly con-
cerning part for the team as they
take their final practices at their
home rink before flying to Canada
tomorrow.
Davis compares going from a
competition of just strictly ice
dancing to a multi-sport event like
the Olympics, to a football player
going from a high school field to
playing at Michigan Stadium.
"This is an incredible opportu-
nity, but you don't want to do any
more or less than we've been doing,
even though the audience is that
much bigger," Davis said. "I'm just
excited about the chance to show
the world what we've been putting
our hard work and sweat into our
whole lives."
And what might be most daunt-
ing is after a lifetime of hard work,
Davis and White will have just one
shot at impressing the judges. That
means just less than three minutes
to make U.S. Olympic history.
But the biggest pressure for these
Olympic rookies isn't the chance to
be gold medalists - it's making sure
not to miss out on any part of the
experience in Vancouver.
"The only way to say it is it's
unbelievably cool," White said.
"The worst thing that can happen
is that we miss out on the Olympic
experience." E

THEOLYMPICISSUE
editors' note

T our readers,
As you peruse the following pages of this week's issue of The Statement, you
may notice things look a little different. We'd like to offer an explanation for the
sudden change to ease any anxiety you may experience with the varied content and design.
To honor the start of the XXI Olympic Winter Games on Friday, The Statement has
teamed up with the Daily's sports staff to bring you our "Olympic Issue." Everyone loves
the Olympics - they give us the opportunity to root unabashedly for Team America, as
well as an very valid excuse to stay glued to the television for two weeks straight. Whether
you prefer skiing, bobsleigh or curling, the games provide something for everyone.
As proud Wolverines, we're ecstatic about the University's solid contingent of par-
ticipants heading to Vancouver to compete. With the help of our more athletic-minded
peers, we've compiled a group of what we believe to be some compelling stories of ath-
leticism, perseverance and straight-up awesomeness - as they relate to the maize and
blue, obviously.
With this special Olympic issue, we bring you the names and faces of Olympians past
and present who, when they weren't training for international competition, were attend-
ing class, writing papers and rocking Michigan T-shirts all over Ann Arbor.
Inthe112yearssince the startofthe modernOlympics,theUniversityhas seen20lof its
students and coaches compete in the games, winning a total of 133 medals. Hoping to add
to that number are two pairs of ice dancers - Meryl Davis (pictured bottom) and Charlie
White (pictured top), and Evan Bates and Emily Samuelson. Along with former Michigan
hockey player, Jack Johnson, these current and former Wolverines hope to do their school
proud.
So read on, and don't forget to look out for the amazing athletes on the following pages,
whether on the ice, the podium or next to you in class.
Enjoy,

A SOVkIET
TAKEOVER
Over the past two decades, a pair of Russian
coaches have helped Ann Arbor become a place
for America's ice dancing elite.
By Katie Field Magazine Staff Writer


Nobody produces figure skaters
like the Soviets. Athletically unpar-
alleled and artistically unrivaled,
the Soviet Union and later the Rus-
sian Federation, has taken home all
but two Olympic ice dance gold med-
als since the sport first appeared in
the games in 1976. In comparison,
the United States has only claimed
bronze and silver - never gold.
That could all change this winter
in Vancouver, where two pairs of
skaters from the University of Michi-
gan are expected to challenge Rus-
sia's dominance in the sport.
Regardless of their Olympic per-
formance this year, these skaters -
Charlie White and Meryl Davis, who*
three weeks ago won gold medal at
the U.S. Ice Dancing championships,
and Emily Samuelson and Evan Bates
- have already helped put Ann Arbor
on the map for world-class skating.
But Ann Arbor's rise to the skating
elite started long before these two
pairs enrolled at the University.
The past two decades have seen
an influx of former Soviet ice dance
champions streaming into Metro
Detroit ice rinks to train the state's
already vast supply of figure skating
talent. Through their efforts, these
coaches and choreographers have
helped transform Michigan, and Ann
Arbor, into an ice-dancing power-
house.
Yaroslava Nechaeva and Yuri
Chesnichenko, known affectionately
as Yasa and Yuri to their athletes,

competed up until the 1992 World
Junior Figure Skating Champion-
ships - where they earned silver
medals - before trading Moscow for
Ann Arbor.
Glancing over the banners hang-
ing on the wall at the Olympic rink in
the Ann Arbor Ice Cube, the tremen-
dous progress they have made in just
one decade is undeniable.
Perhaps there is no better example
of the quick results this elite training
style produces than Yasa and Yuri's
batch of up-and-coming skaters 'at
the Ann Arbor Figure Skating Club.
Of all the teams coming out of the
Ice Cube, Samuelson and Bates best
exemplify what can happen when a
strong technical background and rig-
orous dance training combine on the
ice.
Samuelson and Bates are sopho-
mores at the University, and the third
team selected to represent the United
States in ice dance at the Vancouver
Olympics this month. The rise of
Samuelson and Bates to international
prominence was propelled largely
through the training they received
from Yasa and Yuri.
"The best teams have Russian
coaches," Eric Bates, Evan Bates'
father and a University professor of
Internal Medicine, said in a phone
interview last week. "It's classic
Russian style that they have been
fortunate to be trained in from the
beginning. It gives them technical
benefits versus other couples that

don't have Russian coaches, or that
have Russian coaches in the middle
of their career rather than from the
beginning."
Ask Yuri if there is a formula to
the success of these young Ameri-
can ice dance teams and he chuck-
les. Though he doesn't think there
is a formula, per se, for the success
of his skaters, it's clear they share
many things in common - they all
skate with the power and grace that
reflects a clear Russian influence.
Ice dance teams in the United
States are paired in much the same
way the Soviets paired their Olympic
champions. As Yasa and Yuri were
paired as young skaters in Moscow,
so were Bates and Samuelson, and
the expectations were just as high.

Gold was in the future.
"They had this girl in Novi who
they thought would be a good
match," Eric Bates said referring to
Samuelson. "That's how they do it
in this business; it's like an arranged
marriage."
The training Bates and Samuelson
undergo to reach the elite ice dance
level requires true dedication to an
increasingly competitive sport. The
pressure of high level skating and
schooling exacerbates certain stress-
es that all students feel at one point or
another. To avoid being super seniors
for seven or eight years, Samuelson
and Bates take spring classes during
the time they're learning their new
dances.
As the pair practiced last week,

they looked tired and overwhelmed.
Going through a section of their
American country original dance
with the most difficult moves, Yasa
was focused on the range of exten-
sion of Samuelson's arm in one of the
elements.
The team was red-faced after a few
run-throughs, but at the end Yasa
was satisfied. This attention to detail
is essential for success. Every exten-
sion, edge and position is calculated
and controlled, accounted for and
perfected.
Russian training provides a seem-
ingly unbeatable backdrop of skating
skills, but for generations, Russian
teams were on top because of their
innovative and creative programs.

Wednesday, February 10, 2010 // The Statement 3B
OLYMPIC WOLVERINES
From the Paris games of 1900 through the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the University has seen 205 of its students and coaches
participate in the international sporting event. If the University were its own country, the total medals won by its representa-
tives - 65 gold, 30 silver and 38 bronze - would make the 'U' the 24th most successful country in the history of the games.
What follows are some of the most intriguing and timeless stories of 'U' athletes and leaders to compete in the Olympics.
BY ALLIE WHITE I DEPUTY MAGAZINE EDITOR

Former Michigan hockey player
Jack Johnson is no stranger to
wearing his country's colors.
After all, the reason he first came
to Ann Arbor was to play for the U.S.
National Team Development Program
- a causeway for many hockey players
to the National Hockey League, as well
as to the University of Michigan.
And for those years with the pro-
gram - from 2003 to 2005 - Johnson
wore the colors arguably better than
any defenseman in the program's his-
tory.
Eighty-one points - the most ever
by a defenseman.
Seven points in one game - the
Yoost ever, by anyone.
So when U.S.A. hockey called to
invite Johnson to be part of the 2007
International Ice Hockey Federation
World Championship team, no one
was surprised. It was his fifth year
donning an American hockey jersey.
Even Johnson seemed to know it was
coming.
He wore the red, white and blue,
again, helping the American team on
its path to a bronze medal.
After that, Johnson donned the

in Los Angeles, trying to find his niche said. "It's the biggest stage in the world

on the biggest

stage like that is something I'll never

Toronto Maple Leafs President and
General Manager Brian Burke called
Johnson the next day to congratulate
him, just before the rest of the world
knew.
And unlike any other U.S. Olympic
hockey player, Johnson is leaving early
for Vancouver.

sentative of the U.S.
Hockey team to take
part in the opening
ceremonies. An extra day on the "big-
gest stage," as Johnson repeatedly
called it in a recent interview, could
never hurt.
It was just another day he could
gladly wear those colors.
A lot of the credit for his develop-
ment and his ascension to the world's
biggest stage, according to Johnson,
goes to Berenson and the University of
Michigan.
Every summer, Johnson comes back
to Ann Arbor to train with Berenson
and the rest of the program. To him,
this is the best place to continue finely
tailoring his game.

Unlike many Wolverines, Johnson
never had to come to Ann Arbor to
prove himself. He could have left after
one year or just as easily never blinked
on his way to the NHL.
He was, as current Wolverine Chris
Summers described, "a hockey prodi-
gy."
So when the Carolina Hurricanes
called during the 2006 Stanley Cup
Finals, telling Johnson that they need-
ed him on the roster immediately, Red
Berenson was impressed and proud
when Johnson politely declined.
"He's done everything right, all the
way up," Berenson said in an interview
on Monday.
Johnson may not be at the top of his
game in professional hockey yet. After
all, he would have only graduated
from Michigan two years ago if he had
stayed the full four years.
But an Olympic invitation - a
chance to dust off his American jersey
- could just mean more to him.
"There's a chance that you might
only get one opportunity to play in the
Olympics," Johnson said. "You spend
your entire career trying to crack an
NHL lineup, and the NHL is a special
thing, but being able to call yourself an
Olympian and represent your coun-
try...it's a different kind of special. It's
a worldwide thing." N

When Henry Jamison "Jam" Handy arrived at the University of Michigan, he had hopes of playing football for for-
mer coach Fielding Yost. But at 4-foot-1 and 86 pounds, he was offered a position as team mascot. Despite his initial
setback, Handy went on to become the first Wolverine to ever medal in swimming at the Olympics, winning a
bronze in the 440-yard breaststroke at the 1904 summer games in St. Louis.

Although varsity sports for women didn't exist at the University until the 1970s, Maxine "Micki"
King trained with the men's head diving coach in preparation for the 1968 Mexico City Olym-
pics. After eight dives, King was in first place, but on her ninth, she hit the board and broke
her left arm. Despite not being able to lift her arm over her head, King completed her final
dive and placed fourth overall. At the 1972 games in Munich, King came back and won gold. 4

In a sport dominated by athletes from the former Soviet bloc nations, University alum Steve
Fraser brought home the first-ever gold medal for the United States in Greco-Roman wres-
tling. At the 1984 games in Los Angeles, Fraser defeated the three-time world champion from
Sweden to place first.

t was 1997 and Charlie White had poor
posture.
He was eight years old and had been
skating since he was three but after play-
ing ice hockey he had developed bad
habits. To improve his skating, White's
parents decided to sign him up for ice
dancing lessons.
One town over in West Bloomfield, Mich.,
nine-year-old Meryl Davis was in a similar
situation. She, too, had decided to take up ice
dancing and was looking for a partner. The
choice seemed obvious. The two young skaters
had both trained at the Detroit Skating Club for
years, and White's single skating coach at the
time, Seth Chafetz, thought to himself, "Why
not give it a try?"
The way White, who grew up in Bloomfield
Hills, Mich., and Davis came together couldn't
be further from a storybook beginning. Their
first skating session was so insignificant at the
time that Davis said she barely even remem-
bers when she met her partner.
"I have absolutely no recollection of it," she
said trying to think back to the introduction. "I
can only remember someone asking me to skate
with this crazy kid and thinking that I had no
idea what I was doing."
But certainly what is most uncommon about
Davis and White is that their partnership from
its coincidental beginnings has endured 13
years later, leading them to the University of
Michigan. What started out as an admittedly
awkward practice session between Davis and
White at such a young age has now grown into
a wildly successful partnership that is cur-
rently the longest of its kind in American ice
dancing.
Tomorrow, White and Davis, who won the
gold medal in ice dance at the U.S. Figure Skat-
ing Championships three weeks ago - their

second consecutive national title - will travel
to Vancouver to compete in the 2010 Winter
Olympics. The U.S. has never taken home a gold
medal in ice dancing, but many think Davis and
White are the couple to change all that.

UNLIKELY BEGINNINGS

"Everywhere we go people always want to
know why we have always skated with each
other," White said after a recent practice ses-
sion. "We've been asked a thousand times,
'How is it you manage to stay together?' and
neither of us really have an answer. It's just
always worked out."
An ice dancer's life is rarely left to chance.
Every move on the ice, every flinch is care-
fully calculated. Make no mistake, it's incred-
ibly rare for two ice dancers to skate together
as long as they have, but for Davis and White,
things do seem to have just "worked out."
Considering the way Davis and White began
their careers together, it was highly improb-
able the two would stay a team forever. It's not
unusual for high-performance ice dancers to
cross the country, or even the world, in search
of a partner to take them to the next level. And
it takes an almost perfect combination of ath-
letes with similar body sizes, skating ability
and goals to make the right team.
Even after finding the right partner, it takes
some ice dancing teams years to truly know
whether they can succeed at the highest level
together.
Davis and White are not one of those teams.
It wasn't long after the two started skating
together that they began their ascent through
the ice dancing ranks. Six months after they
met, in March 1998, the team reached the

Junior National Championships - the highest
competition in the sport at the junior level. And
despite being small for their age and competing
against teams who had been paired together
and training for years, they shocked everyone
and finished second.
"Generally what happens is, after a per-
formance like that, you move up a level and it
takes years to get used to the harder dances and
maneuvers," White said. "And if you progress
well as a team then you've got a shot to medal."
The following season Davis and White
moved up to the intermediate level. The danc-
ers were more skilled, the routines were more
difficult and the competition was tough, but
the pair not only qualified for the Junior Olym-
pics, they won first place.
THE SECRET TO MAKING 'LOVE'
It's difficult to categorize the relation-
ship the two have. After suggesting and then
rejecting several analogies to help describe the
dynamic between them, Davis joked that she
wishes "ice dancing partners" would be a Face-
book relationship status.
"We've gotten really lucky," Davis said.
"We've been together since we were eight, so
as opposed to a team that comes together at age
13, 16 or 18, there's been no awkward moments
between us where we thought, 'Uh-oh, maybe I
like them,' or 'Wow, they're really bossy.'"
Anyone who watches one of their skating
programs would think the two were madly
in love. Their legs swish in unison, their hips
sway in harmony and they anticipate each oth-
er's movements while making flawless flips,
twirls and spins. Their body language and
facial expressions show a sense of emotional

connection and passion that has impressed
judges and audiences all over the world.
But spend an afternoon with them at their
home training rink, Arctic Edge Ice Arena in
Canton, Mich., and it's clear how the energy
between them is created. While many who
have watched them dance wonder if their pas-
sion together on the ice is a product of a roman-
tic relationship, the two maintain that has
never been the case. What you see during their
programs is nothing more than the product of
hard work and showmanship painstakingly
perfected over many years.
"it's hard because we're really close and we
spend so much time together, but there is no
romantic connection despite having to portray
one on the ice," Davis said. "It's not a brother-
sister relationship, although sometimes it takes
that form. It's a working relationship and yet, it
is a friendship."
White agrees. He doesn't seea need to assign
roles or place a label on their relationship. To
him, after years of experiencing large amounts
of pressure, stress, exhaustion and lots of suc-
cess together as a team, the most important
thing to him has been the strong sense of trust
and comfort they have in each other.
"I never have to worry about whether one
day my partner is going to go nuts and just lose
it or suddenly just quit, because these things
absolutely happen," he said. "I know we're in
this for each other and not for ourselves which
I can see isn't something all teams can say."
As far as practicing their "romance" on the
ice, that's something that has become almost
second nature. Davis and White can be skat-
ing around the rink carefree and joking with
friends one second, and the next second be in
each other's arms staring intimately into the
other's eyes as if they were the only two people
in the world. In a typical practice session, they

snap in and out of passionate gazes dozens of
times. Both say it's just a matter of discipline.
"It's not hard anymore for us to just switch
on and off the emotion and romance we need to
display on the ice," White said.
"We can get to that point today really fast
because when you're inches away from some-
one else's face it's hard not to be completely
focused on what they are doing," Davis adds.
"We've learned not to spend time worry-
ing about our connection because we've been
together so long we have amazing trust in each
other."
Despite being one of the sport's top teams,
Davis and White remain relatively unknown
to those outside the ice-dancing world and try
their best to maintain a balance in life away
from the ice. Davis is a member of the Delta
Delta Delta sorority and White is an avid hock-
ey fan. It's difficult, though, to deny that their
ice dancing careers have become a greater pri-
ority recently. Neither Davis nor White is tak-
ing classes this semester, choosing instead to
dedicate their time and energy to training. And
in the last four years, the only time they spent
more than three weeks away from the ice was
to give White time to heal from an ankle injury.
When it comes to preparing for competi-
tions, Davis, White and their Russian coaches,
Igor Shpilband and Marina Zueva, don't let a
single detail of their program go unscruti-
nized. Just to stay in shape, the team skates
a minimum of four hours a day. They review
films of previous competitions and practices
and even attend ballet classes.
But Davis and White see themselves as more
than just ice dancers. They are actors, really,
telling a story and drawing their audience into
a particular scene. Part of the challenge each
ice dancer faces is captivating the audience
with their performance. Ice dancing is as much

about entertainment as it is about technical
skating ability.
One of the programs the two will perform
at the Olympics is based on an Indian dance.
To become more comfortable with the style
of dance, the ice dancers brought in an Indian
dance instructor to help them learn more about
where the dance comes from and its historical
and cultural significance.
A CHANCE TO MAKE HISTORY
For as much success as they've had, the two
have largely risen in the sport of ice dancing in
the shadow of their more famous U.S. Olympic
teammates and now rivals, Tanith Belbin and
Ben Agosto. Belbin and Agosto had won five
consecutive U.S. National Championships from
2004-2008 and won the silver medal at the
2006 Winter Olympics. In 2009, when Davis
and White won their first national title, their
achievement was widely overlooked because
Belbin and Agosto had not competed due to
injury.
This year's National Championship competi-
tion,.however, just three weeks ago in Spokane,
Wash., appears to have changed the ice danc-
ing landscape heading into the 2010 Olympics.
For the first time in any competition, Davis and
White defeated Belbin and Agosto.
To fans that haven't watched the sport of ice
dancing since the last Olympics four years ago,
the victory was an upset. And while few would
have guessed in 2006 that Davis and White
would be Olympic gold medal contenders in
2010, their scores over the years have proven
they had actually closed the gap between
themselves and Belbin and Agosto long ago.

We've been together since we
were eight, so ... there's been no
awkward moments between
us where we thought, 'Uh-oh,
maybe I like them,' or 'Wow,
they're really bossy.'
