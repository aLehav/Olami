On Oct. 8, the U.S. Supreme 
Court heard three cases that 
could end protections for 
LGBTQ employees in the 
United States.
In each of the three cases 
brought up to the Supreme 
Court — Altitude Express, 
Inc. v. Zarda, Bostock v. 
Clayton County and R.G. & 
G.R. Harris Funeral Homes 
v. EEOC — the employers 
dismissed their employees 
on the basis of their sexual 
orientation. In both Zarda 
and Bostock, the employees 
Donald Zarda and Gerald 
Bostock allege their employers 
fired 
them 
because 
their 
employers 
discovered 
the 
men were gay. In the Harris 
Funeral 
Homes 
case, 
the 
employee — Aimee Stephens, 
a trans woman — was fired 
because her boss claimed 
that it would be against his 
religion 
for 
Stephens 
“to 
deny (her) sex while acting 
as a representative of (the) 
organization.”
Title 
VII 
of 
the 
Civil 

Rights Act of 1964 protects 
employees 
from 
being 
discriminated against based 
on their race, color, religion, 
national origin or sex. In 
previous 
Supreme 
Court 
cases, “sex” discrimination 
has been interpreted as not 
discriminating 
based 
on 
gender identity. Now, the 
Supreme Court will decide 
if the language “sex” in Title 
VII covers sexual orientation. 
The University’s chapter 
of College Democrats came 
out strongly in support of 
the Supreme Court including 
sexual orientation as a part of 
civil rights. Camille Mancuso, 
communications 
director 
of 
College 
Democrats, 
emphasized the importance 
of the decision.
“LGBTQ+ rights are civil 
rights,” Mancuso said. “From 
the 
inability 
of 
same-sex 
couples to adopt children, to 
being fired in the workplace 
for one’s sexual orientation or 
gender identity, to the murder 
of trans women of color across 
the country, the rights of 
LGBTQ+ folks are constantly 
being threatened.” 

Love is in the air — and online 
— at the University of Michigan.
More 
than 
2,900 
undergraduate 
students 
— 
approximately one out of every 
10 — have completed a new 
matchmaking service survey, 
dubbed the Michigan Marriage 
Pact, as of Thursday afternoon. 

LSA junior Elien Michielssen, 
one of the survey’s creators, 
said a team of students created 
the online questionnaire for a 
class project in Psychology 223.
“There’s a lot of dating sites 
out there — some that people 
are 
comfortable 
with 
and 
some that people aren’t — and 
we wanted to do something 
that was Michigan-specific,” 
Michielssen said. “We wanted 
to bring it to Michigan and spice 

up the campus a little bit.”
Michielssen 
said 
the 
questionnaire, which opened 
Saturday 
afternoon, 
has 
a 
lifespan of 21 days. At the 
end of the submission period, 
students will be emailed their 
match’s name and potentially 
a message from their match, 
though 
Michielssen 
said 
there is a possibility that not 
every person who completes 
the questionnaire will have a 

match.
Participants 
answer 
a 
series of 40 questions, ranging 
from the likelihood of using 
a 
prenuptial 
agreement 
to 
views on gun ownership. The 
questionnaire also asks students 
to rate the levels of their drug 
and alcohol use, sex lives, 
cleanliness, spending habits and 
other personality traits.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Paani, a non-profit started 
by 
University 
alumni 
in 
response 
to 
the 
growing 
water shortage in Pakistan, 
spearheaded a teach-in on 
the 
humanitarian 
crisis 
in 
Kashmir, 
a 
disputed 
territory 
in 
the 
northern 
part 
of 
India, 
Thursday 
night. 
In 
particular, 
the 
event focused on the current 
state of Indian-administered 
Kashmir 
following 
India’s 
tighter control and erosion of 
democratic freedoms in the 
region. 
Paani organized the teach-
in in conjunction with several 
other cultural organizations 
on campus. Rackham student 
Nishita 
Trisal, 
a 
Ph.D. 
candidate 
in 
anthropology 
studying 
Kashmir, 
and 
Rackham 
student 
Safwaan 
Mir, 
president 
of 
the 
University’s chapter of Stand 
with Kashmir, headed the 
teach-in by presenting on the 
current crisis in the region 
and the history and context 
of 
the 
situation. 
Though 
both individuals come from 
Kashmiri backgrounds, Trisal 
noted they are not speaking for 
all Kashmiris, especially since 
the current communications 
blackout in Indian-controlled 
Kashmir means those in the 
region may not be able to 
speak themselves on these 

issues right now. 
Mir explained both India 
and Pakistan are interested 
in the Kashmir region for 
its natural resources, such 
as water, and because of its 
strategic 
military 
position 
between the two countries 
and China. Mir emphasized 

the suffering of the Kashmiri 
people is lost in the struggle 
for dominance between these 
two powerful countries. 
“(India 
and 
Pakistan’s) 
interests 
are 
primarily 
going to be in their strategic 
political position, not in the 
interest and the well-being of 

the Kashmiri people who have 
suffered the most,” Mir said. 
“Instead, the truly legitimate 
way to look at the situation is 
for Kashmiris to have a right 
to choose for themselves what 
they want to be and what their 
future is.”

University of Michigan alum 
Alex Lieberman spoke about 
Morning Brew, the startup he 
founded after graduating from 
the Ross School of Business 
in 
2015, 
at 
the 
Robertson 
Auditorium Thursday.
Lieberman is the co-founder 
and CEO of Morning Brew, 
a daily email newsletter that 
condenses business news into 
content that appeals to a younger 
audience. During his time at the 
Business 
School, 
Lieberman 
said he realized there wasn’t 
a platform that made business 
news interesting for students 
and young adults. 
“These students are working 
their asses off to have careers 
in business, and yet they don’t 
have content that’s storytelling 
the business world in a fun and 
engaging way,” Lieberman said. 
“So I just started writing a daily 
business roundup — which at the 
time looked very different from 
Morning Brew — but I would say 
had a lot of the same DNA.”

About 70 faculty, staff and 
students were in attendance 
on Thursday at LSA’s Office of 
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 
panel 
focused 
on 
bringing 
awareness 
to 
Asian 
Pacific 
Islander 
Desi/American 
and 
Middle Eastern/North African 
identities at the University of 
Michigan. The event featured 
five speakers, all of whom were 
faculty and staff members at the 
University. 
The event began with questions 
from the hosts directed to specific 
panelists. 
The 
first 
question 
was for Melissa Borja, assistant 
professor in A/PIA studies, about 
the history of APID/A individuals 
at the University. 
Borja explained the importance 
of individuals claiming a specific 
identity and then allowing it 
to be counted in the school’s 
demographics. She explored the 
concept by using the example 
of how Asian Americans have 
changed the way they identify 
themselves over time.

The first-ever recipient 
of the James B. Hudak 
Professorship 
of 
Health 
Policy, Paula Lantz, gave 
her 
inaugural 
lecture 
to 
about 
150 
students 
and 
faculty on Thursday night. 
The event focused on the 
history and current policies 
surrounding 
population 
health disparities. 
The Ford School of Public 
Policy established the James 
B. Hudak Professorship of 
Health Policy in the spring 
of 2019 to be awarded to 
a faculty member at the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
who is engaging in research 
focused on both investigating 
and addressing of problems 

within the United States 
healthcare system. 
In 
her 
introduction 
of 
Lantz, economics professor 
Susan M. Collins said Lantz 
is one of her close colleagues 
and someone with significant 
impact in the Public Policy 
School.
“There 
isn’t 
much 
happening 
at 
the 
Ford 
School that Paula hasn’t had 
a positive influence on in a 
variety of different ways,” 
Collins said.
Collins said Lantz is very 
knowledgeable in the field of 
population health and was the 
director for the University of 
Michigan Policies for Action 
Research Hub. 
In an interview with The 
Daily prior to the lecture, 
Public 
Policy 
graduate 

student Andrew Krantz said 
he wanted to hear some of 
Lantz’s knowledge about her 
field, specifically that of the 
history of health disparities. 
“I’m interested in hearing 
her explain some of the 
history of the population 
health disparities,” Krantz 
said. “I’m not as familiar 
with the literature on that, 
and from what I understand, 
she’s kind of an expert in that 
area.” 
In 
her 
lecture, 
Lantz 
described the current state of 
population health in the U.S., 
pointing to certain statistics 
such 
as 
life 
expectancy, 
which has declined in the 
past few years. She also spoke 
about the differences in life 
expectancy 
according 
to 
varying social determinants 
of health, such as race and 
socioeconomic status. 
“Any health topic we 
want to talk about — any 
disease, any health issue 
— is going to be patterned 
by social class and by 
race, ethnicity, gender, 
place; it goes on and on,” 
Lantz said.
Lantz 
voiced 
her 
concerns about the new 
definition and movement 
of 
Population 
Health 
Management. 
Though 
she 
said 
she 
is 
glad 
there are conversations 
about health disparities, 
Lantz said she fears the 
issues 
are 
becoming 
“medicalized” 
— 
the 
characterization 
of 
certain health outcomes 
as 
medical 
conditions 
to be treated when they 
could simply be symptoms 
of a health disparity. 
The difference between 
health policy and health 
care policy was another 
focus of Lantz’s lecture.
“We 
have 
a 
hard 

time thinking about health 
without 
thinking 
about 
health care,” Lantz said. “But 
they’re not the same thing, 
and health disparities are 
not the same thing as health 
care access, quality, outcome 
disparities. Health equity is 
not the same thing as health 
care equity.” 
Public 
Health 
junior 
Catherine Marudo told The 
Daily she was interested 
to 
learn 
about 
Lantz’s 
distinctions between health 
policy and health care policy, 
especially as an aspiring 
physician. 
“I didn’t really realize 
there was a distinction where 
one was more downstream, 
which was health care policy, 
or one was more upstream, 
which was health policy,” 
Marudo said. “And I thought 
that was really interesting 
for somebody who is going 
to go into that field to come 
to that realization, because 
I thought it was just all 
upstream.” 
In 
an 
interview 
with 
The Daily, Public Health 
junior 
Bianca 
Ghita 
said 
she 
believed 
the 
content 
that Lantz was delivering 
was important, but would 
perhaps have more impact 
on an audience less familiar 
with the information. 
“There are things in our 
society that most people 
expect to function flawlessly, 
and these are things that, 
when they do, kind of get off 
track or there are issues with 
it, it angers a lot of people,” 
Ghita said. “I feel like her 
talk is really informative, 
and it was really great, but 
it would be really great for 
people that aren’t already 
super excited about this type 
of work.”

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
We’re being very strategic about who is going to be involved 
with which things related to the debate. When we know we have a 
football game, the hospital steps up in ways that are very different than 
our normal operation, so that we can anticipate and plan for medical 
emergencies that might be affiliated with that. So, I would imagine in 
many of our areas, we’re going to do the same sort of planning to step 
up and be ready.”

Dean of Students Laura Blake Jones, on the University’s preparation for hosting a presidential debate in October 2020

Every Friday, one Daily staffer will give a behind the scenes look 
at one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA sophomore Parnia 
Mazhar reported on the lack of diversity at the Ross School of 
Business.

“It was a different process than most of my other stories because I 
had to really do an in-depth investigation to ensure that I was getting 
a true and different perspective on diversity in the Business School. 
Every time I interviewed a new source, new information came out 
that I wanted to look into further. While that made it a lengthier 
process, I think it was definitely worth it because I got information 
and perspectives from people who may not have their voices heard 
frequently a lot on campus. I think my process for this story helped 
open my eyes to how important our jobs are as student journalists.”

Parnia Mazhar, Daily Staff Reporter

“The term ‘Asian American’ 
was first used in the 1960s for 
very specific political purposes,” 
Borja said. “Japanese Americans, 
Chinese 
Americans, 
Filipino 
Americans and other people’s 
Asian ancestry decided that it 
was politically advantageous for 
them to unite under that political 
category, and we can’t ignore 
that this category continues to 
be politically contested — that 
they are continuing to grapple 
about the boundaries of this 
category.” 
Matthew Stiffler, a lecturer 
in 
American 
Culture 
and 
researcher at the Arab American 
National Museum in Dearborn, 
Mich., commented on the idea 
of identity further by describing 
a similar struggle for ME/
NA-identifying individuals. He 
explained how the umbrella 
term ME/NA is a relatively new 
concept, and the countries that 
fall under this term are still 
developing. 
“To think of ME/NA as a 
rallying identity for people in the 
United States … (is) a very recent 
history,” Stiffler said. “Where it 
comes from the need to have an 

identity is recent. Where we’re 
at as a nation, (ME/NA) boxes 
matter.”
The discussion then moved 
to why checkboxes exist, what 
data is collected and where the 
University is going in terms of 
demographic data collection. 
Traci Buckner, lead analyst 
at University Human Resource 
Records 
and 
Information 
Services, spoke about the ways in 
which federal requirements play 
into how the University handles 
demographic 
information 
regarding faculty and staff. The 
office of UHRRIS follows the 
federal guidelines in collecting 
demographic 
data, 
but 
the 
process can be complicated 
when a faculty or staff member 
does not disclose their ethnicity. 
Paul 
Robinson, 
associate 
vice provost at the Office of 
the Registrar, discussed the 
extended ethnicities initiative 
for both students and faculty 
at the University that allows 
students 
to 
update 
their 
identities in Wolverine Access 
according to their specific racial 
and ethnic identities. 
“In the last several months, 
we 
enabled 
our 
students’ 
systems and HR systems to be 
able to capture some data of 
ethnicities,” Robinson said. 

Ravi Pendse, vice president 
of 
information 
technology 
and chief information officer 
at the University, reminded 
the 
audience 
that 
while 
demographic data collection is 
essential to representation, the 
University must also respect 
students’ rights to information 
and data privacy. 
“All 
of 
that 
information, 
powered by data that we all 
generate, has to be somewhere 
work has to be analyzed, has 
to be protected, has to be 
thoughtfully used,” Pendse said. 
“I’m a director here saying that 
we must make available to our 
entire campus for students first, 
a data dashboard that students 
can look at and see what data 
we are collecting on them, and 
why.”
Rackham student Alyssa Park 
told The Daily she attended the 
event because of her interest in 
the desegregation of data around 
Asian American students and 
erasure of specific ethnic groups 
who fall under the pan-Asian 
identity.
“Something that really stuck 
out to me in this event is the 
power of data and the actions 
that can be taken from what we 
find out or what we choose to 
find out,” Park said. 

The 
modern 
division 
of 
the 
Kashmir 
region 
came 
about following the partition 
of British India into India 
and 
Pakistan 
in 
1947, 
which displaced millions of 
people along religious lines, 
including 
the 
Kashmiris, 
Trisal 
explained. 
Since 
the implementation of the 
Indian Constitution in 1950, 
which gave Kashmir semi-
autonomy, there have been 
Kashmiri 
movements 
for 
self-determination often met 
with violent responses by the 
Indian government. 
On Aug. 5, the Parliament 
of 
India 
repealed 
Articles 
370 and 35A in the Indian 
Constitution, 
taking 
away 
Kashmir’s autonomy. Trisal 
explained this decision was 
announced 
amid 
a 
total 
communications blackout and 
a military lockdown of the 
region, both of which are still 
ongoing. 
“What 
was 
so 
shocking 
about this act is that overnight 
these protections were taken 
away,” Trisal said. “I think 

it’s important to point out the 
decision flew in the face of 
international norms.”
In 
addition 
to 
other 
complications, 
the 
blackout 
has caused a medical crisis 
in the region as hospitals 
struggle to coordinate and 
people are unable to call for 
help. Thousands of Kashmiris 
have 
also 
been 
allegedly 
tortured and detained without 
trial or due process since the 
crackdown began.
“I consider it war, that the 
Indian government went to 
war 
with 
the 
Kashmirian 
people,” 
Mir 
said. 
“You’re 
looking at thousands upon 
thousands of unmarked graves 
that exist in the Kashmir 
valley, disappearances, arrests 
— all these things the Indian 
army had the rights to do 
without repercussions.”
Trisal 
and 
Mir 
urged 
the audience to continue to 
inform themselves and others 
of the situation in Kashmir 
by attending similar events, 
engaging 
in 
social 
media 
campaigns 
and 
contacting 
legislators. 
Paani 
co-founder 
Omar 
Ilyas, 
a 
University 
alum, 
explained 
the 
organization 
intentionally 
worked 
to 

empower 
the 
voices 
of 
Kashmiris, who he said often 
go unheard in the discussion 
about the Kashmir crisis. 
“A 
lot 
of 
different 
information come out from a 
lot of different news outlets, 
and each of them have their 
own sort of bias. But something 
you don’t hear often is the 
perspective from Kashmiris,” 
Ilyas said. “We wanted to 
create a space that upholds 
and focuses on the Kashmiri 
narrative, where Kashmiris 
are able to speak on behalf of 
their own people instead of 
where people are speaking on 
behalf of them.”
LSA senior Humza Hemani 
told The Daily he came to the 
teach-in specifically to hear 
Kashmiri perspectives on the 
issue. 
“I actually wasn’t going to 
come until I found out they 
were making an effort to make 
it Kashmiri viewpoints rather 
than Pakistani ones,” Hemani 
said. “I’ve seen the propaganda 
from the Pakistani side, from 
the Indian side, but I feel like 
this is a viewpoint that has 
more legitimacy to it.”

Based on the responses, 
an algorithm finds another 
person who it deems the 
best fit for each individual 
participant 
and 
the 
two 
receive each other’s email 
as their match. Once that 
information is sent out, it is 
up to the students to decide 
how to proceed, as there is no 
requirement for participants 
to communicate with their 
matches.
Michielssen 
noted 
the 
service 
is 
only 
open 
to 
undergraduate students, so 
any graduate students or 
alumni who attempt to fill 
out the questionnaire will 
be disqualified. Only a valid 
University email is required 
to fill out the form, but the 
software filters out non-
undergraduate emails. 
LSA senior Beatrice Kelly-
Andrews said she found the 
questions in the survey to be 
similar to those found in a 
compatibility test. While she 
is not seriously looking for a 
relationship, Kelly-Andrews 
said she is interested to see 
what the creators deemed 
important for a match and 
who the algorithm finds for 
her. 
“I would sort of love to meet 
the person who someone else 
says is perfect for me and 
see what aspects of myself 
from the survey are found in 
other people that make them 
‘perfect,’” 
Kelly-Andrews 
said. “I’m also not looking 
for love or a relationship, so 
I would absolutely reach out 
to them and be like, ‘Hey, 
want to grab coffee and hang 
out?’ Like, maybe you’re my 
best friend, maybe you’re my 
arch nemesis, maybe you’re 
just a cool person, but I sort 
of need to let them know I’m 
not looking to date them.”
To come up with the 
questions, 
Michielssen 
said she and her group of 
co-creators 
researched 
compatibility. 
The 
group 
used their findings to draft 
questions related to issues 
important to a successful 
relationship, 
while 
also 
keeping 
the 
questions 
engaging for students.
LSA junior Nick Cassar, 
who is also a student in 
Psychology 223 but not a 
member of this group, took 
the questionnaire and said he 
would be interested to meet 
the person who matches 
with him.
Cassar said he found the 
questions about sexual habits 
important, as they relate to 
healthy relationships.
“It would still be really 
cool to see this person (who) 
is clearly a lot like me, their 
answers 
were 
extremely 
similar 
to 
mine,” 
Cassar 
said. 
“I’m 
actually 
in 
a 
relationship, so I’m definitely 
not looking for the love of my 
life, but, hey, maybe in 20 
years I can go back to this 
person and marry them.”
This type of service is 
not a new phenomenon on 

college campuses. According 
to The Harvard Crimson, 
Datamatch, a matchmaking 
system created by Harvard 
University 
students 
in 
1994, expanded to Brown, 
Columbia 
and 
Wellesley 
Universities in 2018.
In 
2017, 
students 
at 
Stanford University created 
an algorithm, named the 
Stanford Marriage Pact, to 
match students. Michielssen 
said the Stanford Marriage 
Pact was her team’s original 
inspiration, 
though 
the 
questionnaire was private, 
so all the questions her team 
asks are original.
LSA 
junior 
Kendall 
Johnson 
said 
she 
felt 
the 
questionnaire 
was 
a 
better avenue for finding 
a relationship than dating 
applications like Tinder, but 
she does not like the fact she 
will only receive one person 
back as a match. Johnson also 
said she recognized there 
may be issues if students who 
took the survey looking for a 
relationship were matched 
with students who took it for 
entertainment.
“Even 
when 
you’re 
on 
Tinder, you don’t know who’s 
that serious about it and 
who’s not, and that’s just part 
of the dating experience,” 
Johnson said. “You’re not 
always going to find someone 
who’s looking for the same 
thing as you, and you just 
have to be able to handle 
that and bounce back and be 
cool with it. So, obviously, if 
someone was really hoping 
to find their future partner, 
hopefully they find them, 
but they can’t be that upset if 
they don’t.”
Kelly-Andrews 
said, 
if 
anything, 
the 
matching 
service was the opposite of 
Tinder because participants 
know they have something 
in common with their match 
but have not had a chance to 
talk to them. On Tinder, there 
is an immediate opportunity 
for 
discussion 
but 
no 
guarantee 
of 
similarities. 
Johnson noted Tinder is 
heavily based on photos and 
physical features, while the 
questionnaire is focused on 
personality, 
which 
could 
provide 
the 
opportunity 
for 
more 
meaningful 
connections.
However, others, like LSA 
sophomore Patrick Potoczak, 
still 
find 
at 
least 
some 
knowledge about physical 
appearance 
important. 
Though 
he 
said 
he 
can 
understand 
the 
value 
in 
not having any information 
about looks in the matching 
system, 
he 
said 
physical 
attraction is necessary for 
relationships to succeed.
“I 
think 
physical 
appearance 
is 
very 
important, so I’m curious 
to see how that would be or 
what the general consensus is 
to see if personalities match, 
but appearances do not,” 
Potoczak said. “My biggest 
concern is that, number one, 
I’m just going to get matched 
with my friend or someone I 
already know, and then my 

second biggest one is that I 
won’t be physically attracted 
to the person because of 
their appearance.”
While Michielssen said the 
Pact’s website did poke fun 
at Tinder and the awkward 
situations students can find 
themselves in, her team was 
not trying to brand their 
service as an alternative for 
the application.
The 
purpose 
of 
the 
service, Michielssen said, is 
actually to give participants 
a backup plan so they can 
focus on their academics and 
careers. Then, if they do not 
have a significant partner in 
the future, they can go back 
to their Michigan Marriage 
Pact match. 
“It’s not really a dating 
service, and it isn’t meant to 
set people up with a match 
right 
away,” 
Michielssen 
said. “Its main intent is just 
to provide people with a 
backup plan so that if they 
both end up single in 20 
years, then that’s the person 
that they get married to.” 
Barstool Sports, a sports 
and 
pop 
culture 
blog, 
featured the questionnaire 
in a story on its University 
of 
Michigan-focused 
Instagram 
account. 
According to Michielssen, 
 
the 
account 
owners 
wrote in the post that the 
questionnaire creators were 
lonely 
computer 
science 
students, but noted her and 
her group members were 
neither lonely nor majoring 
in computer science.
The link has also gained 
traction by circulating in 
group chats for fraternity 
and sorority life and other 
organizations 
on 
campus, 
as well as through word 
of mouth. Kelly-Andrews, 
who is not on social media, 
said she heard about the 
questionnaire 
from 
her 
roommates and sent it to 
many people she knew in 
addition to a group chat for 
students in her major.
She 
also 
noted 
the 
importance 
of 
having 
a 
diverse set of participants. If 
the majority of respondents 
are one gender and looking 
for the opposite gender, she 
explained, then it would 
be more difficult for the 
algorithm to find the people 
in that group a match.
“I filled it out, and then I 
realized I was sort of scared 
that if, depending on how 
small it got, it would just 
be my friend group and my 
friends’ friend groups and 
some 
computer 
science 
majors,” 
Kelly-Andrews 
said. “If (the creators) are 
looking to make people fall 
in love, I think they have a 
responsibility to make sure 
everybody has an option to 
be in love, or meet a friend or 
ghost someone new.”
Michielssen 
said 
her 
team has seen more female 
participants than male so 
far. She said they are hopeful 
this will even out over time 
and have recently noticed an 
uptick in heterosexual males 
completing the form.

“The Supreme Court must 
protect the rights of these 
individuals, and including the 
protection of sexual orientation 
under Title VII is a necessary 
step in the work to achieve full 
LGBTQ+ 
equality. 
Without 
such protections, LGBTQ+ folks 
will be discriminated against, 
targeted, and forced to choose 
between living authentically and 
making a living for themselves 
and their families.”
LSA senior Alyson Grigsby, 
co-chairwoman 
of 
the 
Coalition for Queer and Trans 
People of Color, also said she 
was worried that the if the 
Supreme Court decides not 
to protect sexual orientation, 
it could lead to members of 
the LBGTQ community being 
unable to be comfortable in the 
workplace. 
“(It 
would) 
affect 
me 
depending on … how I would 
choose to present myself to 
work or my partner,” Grigsby 
said. “Am I fully able to be 
authentic in the workplace?”
Grigsby 
also 
added 
the 
decision could impact how 
LBGTQ 
members 
present 
themselves 
in 
their 
work 
environments. 
“Even 
with 
things 
like 
presentation, 
depending 
on 

where you work at,” Grigsby 
said. “Your gender presentation 
— that could get you potential 
discrimination.” 
Mark 
Chung 
Kwan 
Fan, 
the 
assistant 
director 
for 
engagement for the Unversity’s 
Spectrum Center, explained 
how students who have felt 
adversely affected by LGBTQ 
discrimination can turn to the 
center’s resources. 
“The Spectrum Center is 
professionalized in being able 
to support (students) no matter 
what type of concern they are 
going through,” Chung Kwan 
Fan said. “They might be going 
through, let’s say a financial 
concern, 
because 
maybe 
they’ve been disowned by their 
family, right? We can help with 
that. Looking for resources, 
a transition of sorts, we work 
hard to get help with that. One 
of the things that we do here is 
to be able to make bridges and 
gaps between resources.” 
Chung 
Kwan 
Fan 
added 
these national issues often 
impact 
students’ 
day-to-day 
lives, and the Spectrum Center 
can help students navigate 
these difficulties on campus.
“So when those national 
issues are happening right 
now, whether that is work 
discrimination and women’s 
condition or whether to (it 
is) be able to use different 
bathrooms, 
or 
being 
fired 

because of your identities, all 
of those things, we are able 
to help typically in regards to 
how they can navigate campus, 
especially, when these national 
issues are happening,” Chung 
Kwan Fan said.
LSA senior Konrat Pekkip, 
co-chair 
of 
Stonewall 
Democrats, noted the impact 
of the Supreme Court decision 
will 
disproportionately 

affect 
LGBTQ 
members 
in 
underprivileged communities. 
“Institutionalized 
homophobia is a lot more of 
an issue when it intersects 
with poverty,” Pekkip said. 
“It probably won’t affect me 
personally, 
because 
I 
am 
very 
privileged, 
because 
I 
have a degree, or I will have 
a degree, from the University 
of Michigan. Overall, I’m in 
an economically secure place. 
But a lot of people are not as 
privileged as I am.”
Pekkip 
hopes 
people 
will look beyond their own 
communities 
to 
understand 
long-term effects. 
“I 
think 
it’s 
not 
only 
important 
to 
think 
about 
the people you know in your 
personal life and how they can 
be affected but think about 
the broader picture and think 
about those people who you 
don’t interact with,” Pekkip 
said.

The event was sponsored 
by the TAMID group, a 
club 
that 
helps 
business 
students 
connect 
with 
Israel’s economy. Shalena 
Srna, assistant professor of 
marketing at the Business 
School, 
moderated 
the 
event. Lieberman, a former 
TAMID 
group 
member, 
shared insights about the 
fundamentals 
of 
starting 
a business and how the 
company has fared through 
rapid changes.
He started the newsletter 
as a senior in 2015 with Austin 
Reif, a 2017 University alum 
. Currently, Morning Brew 
has an audience of more than 
a million subscribers. 
Lieberman said Morning 
Brew is coming out with 
new ways to share business 
content all the time, noting 
the 
company 
currently 
offers four products: the 
core newsletter, the retail 
newsletter, 
the 
emerging 
technology newsletter and a 
podcast.
“Basically, for the first 
two and a half years of being 
full time in this business, we 
did one thing: We just sent 
out our daily newsletter, and 
we did it extremely well,” 
Lieberman said. “I think 
focus is the biggest thing. A 
lot of people would say that 
it isn’t very sexy to send 
out one email newsletter 
every single day for two 
and a half years. People 
think it probably can get 

monotonous and email is not 
like an exciting technology, 
but often in my view is that 
what is sexy is building 
love. With an audience that 
you can then parlay into 
other things, there are so 
few media companies in the 
world right now that have 
actually built deep loyalty 
with their audience.” 
When Lieberman attended 
the University, he said he 
expected to go into finance. 
After graduation, he got a job 
at Morgan Stanley. However, 
he was working on Morning 
Brew at the same time and 
said he found he enjoyed 
that more than his day job at 
Morgan Stanley. Ultimately, 
he decided to leave Morgan 
Stanley and go all in with 
Morning Brew. 
Lieberman said he is OK 
with being uncomfortable as 
long as he enjoys what he is 
doing.
“I 
think 
it’s 
this 
perspective that was forced 
upon me, that life is so 
precious that kind of got 
me thinking: I actually am 
more scared by not being 
uncomfortable,” Lieberman 
said. 
Business freshman Avery 
Bradshaw said hearing about 
Lieberman’s success made 
her more confident about her 
education at the University.
“My favorite part about 
this event as a new member 
of 
TAMID 
was 
hearing 
about the immense success 
that Alex Lieberman has had 
in his business,” Bradshaw 
said. “As a student at the 
University of Michigan and 

a member of TAMID, it 
was really reassuring that 
this institution and all the 
opportunities available will 
only lead students to success 
in the future.”
Lieberman said he focuses 
on the creative aspect of 
the newsletter while his 
co-founder, Reif works on 
the 
analytical 
elements 
of Morning Brew. He said 
storytelling is the secret 
to his success at Morning 
Brew, adding that making 
complex topics relatable to 
the readers is a top priority.
“To 
me, 
understanding 
how 
to 
teach 
something 
makes you hypersensitive 
to good storytelling, and 
how to distill things that 
are complex in a simple way 
that, at the end of the day, at 
the heart of Morning Brew, 
think about what we do,” 
Lieberman said. 
Business 
freshman 
Richard Shu said he enjoyed 
learning about the process of 
entrepreneurship.
“I 
really 
liked 
how 
Alex 
talks 
about 
his 
process 
in 
going 
into 
entrepreneurship,” Shu said. 
“Entrepreneurship 
seems 
like a really far off goal that 
not everybody — but a lot of 
people — go into and there 
are a lot of failures, and 
seeing somebody who was 
successful in it talk about his 
thought processes behind it, 
I thought that was extremely 
insightful.”

The consequences of a conservative Supreme Court
E

arlier this month, the 
Supreme Court began 
its new term. On the 
docket for 2019 through 2020 
are several paramount cases, 
ranging 
from 
potentially 
limiting 
women’s 
access 
to 
abortion 
to 
weakening 
the Affordable Care Act to 
stripping LGBTQ folks of their 
civil rights. 
This 
term 
will 
be 
the 
second full term with the 
current 
group 
of 
justices 
following 
the 
confirmation 
of Brett Kavanaugh, who was 
credibly accused of sexually 
assaulting 
multiple 
women 
and lied under oath. With the 
retirement of Justice Anthony 
Kennedy in 2018, who was 
often considered a swing vote, 
Kavanaugh’s 
confirmation 
means the Supreme Court is 
now solidly conservative. 
Though 
Republicans 
scoffed at women’s fear that 
Kavanaugh’s 
confirmation 
meant the end of Roe v. Wade 
and Planned Parenthood v. 
Casey, even calling women 
“hysterical,” 
Kavanaugh’s 
confirmation 
marked 
the 
court’s sharp ideological shift 
to the right and the beginning 
of the end for legal abortion in 
the United States. 
In 
2016, 
the 
Supreme 
Court struck down a Texas 
law 
that 
limited 
abortion 
access; however, it has now 
decided to hear a case about 
a similar Louisiana law that 
requires abortion providers 
to have admitting privileges 
at 
local 
hospitals. 
Eager 
to 
avoid 
controversy 
and 
legal liability, though, local 
hospitals are unwilling to give 
abortion providers admitting 
privileges. Masked as concern 
for 
women’s 
health, 
given 
abortion is an “extremely safe” 
medical procedure, the law 
is ultimately geared toward 
ending abortion access without 
overturning Roe outright. 
In another set of cases, the 
court will decide if workplace 
discrimination and firing is 
legally based on an employee’s 
gender 
identity 
or 
sexual 
orientation. The first pair of 
cases concern two men who 
were fired for being gay. The 
other case was brought by a 
transgender woman, Aimee 
Stephens, 
who 
was 
fired 
after telling her boss that she 
was deciding to embrace her 
gender 
identity 
and 
begin 
transitioning. 
The Supreme Court will 
decide if the Civil Rights Act 

of 1964, specifically Title VII, 
which 
prohibits 
workplace 
discrimination on the basis of 
sex, race, color, national origin 
and religion, applies to LGBTQ 
people. In other words, it 
will decide whether or not 
queer 
people 
have 
rights. 
As if this wasn’t atrocious 
enough, the rulings could have 
broader impact on all workers 
because the case challenges 
protections for anyone who 
does not conform to gender 
stereotypes. 
“A 
rule 
in 
(the 
Trump 
administration’s) 
favor 
could 
drastically 
change 
workplace 
protections 
for 
all women, whether or not 
they are LGBTQ, and anyone 
who does not conform to the 
administration’s 
preferred 
gender 
norms. 
That 
could 
include men with long hair, 
women with short hair, men 
who are primary caretakers 
of children or parents, women 
who wear pants, women who 
work outside the home or are 
the primary breadwinners,” 
said journalist Ann Friedman 
in 
a 
recent 
conversation 
with Chase Strangio, a staff 
attorney for the American 
Civil 
Liberties 
Union 
and 
trans rights activist.
The other important cases 
the Supreme Court will hear 
involve 
immigration, 
the 
Affordable Care Act and the 
Second Amendment. One case 
on immigration will decide 
if the Trump administration 
can 
end 
protections 
for 
“Dreamers” in DACA, and 
another will decide border 
control 
policies. 
A 
case 
involving 
the 
ACA 
would 
allow insurance companies to 
receive $12 billion from the 
federal government as a result 
of Republicans voting to gut 
the healthcare law. Finally, 
another case will decide the 
legality of New York’s gun law 
limiting the distribution and 
transportation of firearms. 
With 2020 looming, it is 
hard to believe the Supreme 
Court would hear cases on 
such divisive issues in an 
election year. And yet, here we 
are. 
With 
one 
single 
vote, 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
could 
eliminate 
decades 
worth 
of progress for women and 
queer folks. Border patrol 
and gun advocates could be 
strengthened. The ACA could 
be undermined. So how did we 
get here? 
In 
case 
you 
forgot 
or 

haven’t been paying attention 
for the last three horrifying 
years, we’re here because of 
President Donald Trump and 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch 
McConnell. In a politically-
brazen 
move, 
McConnell 
stole 
Merrick 
Garland’s 
seat on the Supreme Court 
in order to hold it open for 
a conservative justice. It is 
important to remember how 
Trump’s campaign released a 
list of potential conservative 
Supreme 
Court 
nominees 
during the 2016 campaign, 
which was at least a partially 
motivating factor for Trump’s 
voters. Then the Republicans, 
including disappointing votes 
from U.S. Sens. Susan Collins, 
R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, 
R-Alaska, confirmed a second 
man who was accussed of 
committing sexual abuse to 
the highest court in the land.
Some of the candidates in 
the Democratic primary have 
put forth ideas about how to 
make the Supreme Court more 
democratic — as in democracy, 
not the Democratic Party. 
Many candidates are open 
to court packing, enacting 
term limits for justices or 
impeaching Brett Kavanaugh 
for 
new 
sexual 
assault 
allegations. 
Notably, 
the 
Democratic 
frontrunner, 
former Vice President Joe 
Biden, does not support an 
impeachment of Kavanaugh. 
While I understand the 
pushback on court packing 
because 
it 
enables 
the 
Republicans to do it freely 
in 
the 
future, 
we 
should 
remember that the Republicans 
already changed the number of 
justices on the Supreme Court. 
When McConnell refused to 
hold hearings for President 
Obama’s 
nominee—Chief 
Judge for the DC Circuit Court 
of Appeals Merrick Garland—
he limited the Supreme Court 
to eight seats for more than a 
year. 
Though Chase Strangio of 
the ACLU has urged people on 
show up and protest outside 
the Supreme Court chambers, 
there is little Democrats and 
progressives can do to stop the 
Supreme Court from stripping 
rights 
from 
millions 
of 
Americans at this point. Going 
forward, though, it is essential 
for Democrats to make the 
Supreme Court a priority at 
the ballot box.

Why you should care about representation
N

owadays, I’ve noticed 
that 
there’s 
been 
a growing wave of 
female celebrities who are 
using their platform to incite 
change by speaking against 
social 
injustices, 
like 
the 
gender pay gap. In her Emmy 
acceptance 
speech, 
actress 
Michelle Williams urged the 
audience, “The next time a 
woman – and especially a 
woman of color, because she 
stands to make 52 cents on 
the dollar compared to her 
white male counterpart – tells 
you what she needs in order 
to do her job, listen to her. 
Believe her.” It’s so important 
to 
heed 
the 
underlying 
message here: This is a call 
to the greater community to 
make a conscious effort to 
create a healthy and inclusive 
work environment in which 
male, female and non-binary 
individuals are valued for 
their work.
Growing 
up, 
when 
I 
watched award shows like 
the Oscars, Emmys, Grammys 
and MTV awards, I’d watch 
solely to confirm whether 
or not my favorite artists or 
actors secured wins in the 
most mainstream categories, 
and then promptly fall asleep 
thereafter. 
The 
next 
day 
I’d wake up and continue 
listening to and watching the 
same artists and actresses. It 
wasn’t a huge of a deal to me.
Fast-forward to the present 
day, and I find myself looking 
specifically 
for 
women 
of 
color, and in general, Black, 
Latinx, Asian and South Asian 
representation 
across 
the 
nominations, and ultimately, 
award winners. This doesn’t 
exclusively apply to awards 
shows, but also on the covers 
of magazines like Elle and 
Time. For example, Mindy 
Kaling and Hasan Minhaj 
were recently featured as the 
front covers of Elle and Vanity 
Fair, respectively.
Mindy Kaling is an Indian 
American comedian and a 
success in the Hollywood 
industry: a director, writer 
and actress, known for her 
original role as Kelly Kapoor 
in “The Office.” To top it all 
off, Kaling has written two 
New York Times bestselling 
memoirs entitled, “Is Everyone 

Hanging Out Without Me?” 
and “Why Not Me?” Another 
example is “The Daily Show” 
alum Hasan Minhaj, who is 
Indian American and Muslim, 
hosts his own Netflix show 
providing a nuanced political 
commentary to global news.
When I saw the two covers 
come out, I recall feeling 
a sense of pride. It’s funny 
because it’s not like a family 
member or best friend of 
mine 
was 
on 
the 
cover. 
But as a person of color, 
there’s something especially 
impactful and personal about 
seeing someone who looks 
like you or talks like you or 
whose beliefs deeply resonate 
with yours make it big in a 
field that is predominantly 
occupied by white men. 
I look up to all the female, 

Indian-American trailblazers 
attempting 
to 
break 
the 
glass ceiling. It’s essential to 
support, share and re-share 
all 
the 
content 
produced 
by 
up-and-coming 
women 
of color to assist them in 
achieving 
their 
goals, 
no 
matter how small or large scale 
they may be. For example, 
Lilly Singh, an openly bisexual 
Indian-Canadian woman — 
better known as YouTube’s 
“Superwoman” 
— 
recently 
became the first woman of 
color to host her own late-
night talk show, “A Little Late 
with Lilly Singh.” She joined 
NBC’s league of male hosts: 
Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers 
and Conan O’Brien.
In 
2016, 
the 
University 
of 
Southern 
California 
Annenberg 
School 
for 
Communication 
and 
Journalism 
faculty 
conducted a research study 
on 
“Hollywood 
Equality: 
All Talk, Little Action.” The 
results of the study confirmed 

expectations: 
Across 
800 
films, 
representation 
of 
gender, race/ethnicity, sexual 
identity 
and 
portrayal 
of 
disability misrepresents the 
diversity of the American 
population. 
A 
few 
key, 
alarming highlights from the 
study include: Among 886 
directors, only 5.5 percent 
were Black and 2.8 percent 
were Asian. To break this 
down even further, of the 
5.5 percent black or African-
American 
directors, 
only 
three were female and of 
the 2.8 percent Asian or 
Asian-American 
directors, 
only one was female. What’s 
even more frustrating, USC 
concluded that if filmmakers 
added five female roles to 
scripts each year this would 
bring us to roughly a 50-50 
male to female ratio. This 
is a seemingly simple fix to 
address gender inequality in 
films.
As 
students 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 
we are privileged to have 
unrestricted 
access 
to 
a 
wide variety of educational 
resources and hundreds of 
year-round 
opportunities 
to 
attend 
events 
run 
by 
multicultural 
clubs 
and 
student organizations, which 
include 
annual 
cultural 
shows, 
student 
dialogues 
and 
culturally 
informative 
fundraisers. Therefore, it is 
incumbent upon us to go out 
and support budding student 
comedians, 
activists 
and 
artists. 
This 
will 
amplify 
the representation of people 
in important platforms and 
creative spaces that lack non-
white roles. It only makes 
sense to populate industries 
with 
the 
same 
level 
of 
diversity that is reflective of 
the composition of America 
and aligns with American 
ideals of equity and inclusion.
Perhaps the most important 
line from Williams’s speech, 
“they understood that when 
you put value into a person, 
it empowers that person to 
get in touch with their own 
inherent 
value. 
And 
then 
where do they put that value? 
They put it into their work.”

T

his year, the University 
of 
Michigan 
saw 
the 
development of a massive 
ongoing student protest regarding 
climate 
change 
on 
campus. 
Thousands of students, faculty and 
community 
members 
attended 
the climate strikes held on the 
Diag last spring and again this fall, 
highlighting just how important 
fighting climate change is in 
students’ minds. On Oct. 10, some 
of the students who were arrested 
at last year’s sit-in at the Fleming 
Administration Building following 
the strike appeared in court to fight 
the charges.
The movement itself, headed by 
a coalition of student groups and 
individuals known as the Climate 
Action Movement at the University 
of 
Michigan, 
includes 
many 
demands involving the University’s 
current 
climate 
policies. 
One 
demand involves the complete 
divestment of fossil fuels from the 
University’s endowment. Last year, 
it was calculated using information 
from the University’s 2017 financial 
reports that roughly $1 billion of the 
total $12 billion endowment is tied 
up in investments related to fossil 
fuels. This raises two questions: 
how can the University’s carbon 
neutrality pledge and current 
climate action plans coexist with 
their investment in fossil fuels? 
And what would the actual effect 
of divestment be? 
What exactly is divestment, 
anyway? Divestment is the process 
by which a company or institution 
sells off stocks or financial assets 
for a certain cause, often associated 
with an intentional statement 
of protest. The thought process 
behind it is if a large number of 
big investors intentionally pull 
their resources, the affected party 
will be forced to cease whatever 
bad practice has drawn criticism, 
or 
simply 
become 
financially 
damaged altogether. In the case 
of the climate movement, we and 
other institutions ought to divest 
from fossil fuels to stand against 

the industry, which is responsible 
for worsening the issues of climate 
change. 
The University is no stranger 
to calls of divestment, as other 
student activists have called on 
this tactic for social change in the 
past before. The only successful 
divestment 
campaign 
on 
the 
University’s campus was back in 
the ’80s, when students pressured 
the regents to fully divest from 
companies 
that 
did 
business 
in South Africa in response to 
Apartheid. More recently, the 
Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions 
movement (BDS) on campus tried 
to push the University to divest 
from Israeli companies in response 
to the ongoing dispute and violence 
in Palestine. The University put out 
a statement that its “longstanding 
policy is to shield the endowment 
from political pressures and to 
base our investment decisions 
solely on financial factors such as 
risk and return.”
Given the pretext that they 
will indeed only divest based on 
risk and returns alone, should 
they 
divest 
now? 
Based 
on 
some recent financial analysis, 
yes. According to a 2018 report 
from the Institute for Energy 
Economics and Financial Analysis, 
there is a legitimate case for 
divesting from fossil fuels. Fossil 
fuel stocks are now increasingly 
speculative. According to IEEFA, 
“Current financial stresses — 
volatile revenues, limited growth 
opportunities, and a negative 
outlook — will not merely linger, 
they will likely intensify.” Suffice it 
to say, investment in fossil fuels is 
likely to become riskier over time, 
and it would be a smart financial 
decision by the University to 
divest.
Everything is a trade-off, and 
divestment is no exception. One of 
the biggest questions surrounding 
divestment is how effective it is in 
actually fighting emissions. A 2018 
report published by the Political 
Economy 
Research 
Institute, 

found “that divestment campaigns, 
considered on their own, have 
not been especially effective as a 
means of significantly reducing 
CO2 emissions, and they are not 
likely to become more effective 
over time.” This is a concerning 
fact that needs to be kept in mind 
during these discussions.
Another issue is who gains 
control of companies once stocks 
are sold from divesting firms. It 
could be the case that if we were 
to sell our holdings, another less-
climate-friendly group could buy 
up shares, who could put less 
pressure on fossil fuel companies 
to have better practices. By 
holding onto our investments, we 
could take a so-called “one hand 
on the wheel” approach. This is a 
double-edged sword: On the one 
hand, we want the ability to nudge 
bad actors in the right direction. 
On the other, holding onto our 
assets means financing something 
we do not support.
Still, it seems wrong that 
the 
University 
holds 
onto 
such a large investment in an 
industry whose values are so 
misaligned with the University’s 
climate goals. It is important to 
remember that divestment, as 
big and complicated as it is, is 
ultimately a moral decision at 
its core. When the University 
divested from South Africa it 
wasn’t a financial decision. It was 
because students stood strong and 
demanded the University act. It is 
understandable to want to avoid 
politicizing something as big and 
important as the endowment, 
but climate change is not really 
a political issue — or at least it 
shouldn’t be. If the University 
is actually committed to being a 
leader in the climate action space, 
then divestment from fossil fuels 
needs to remain on the table as a 
serious possibility. We can’t have 
it both ways.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

The University Musical Society first invited 
Sankai Juku to Ann Arbor in 1996. Now, over 
20 years later, this weekend will mark their 
eighth and ninth performances at the Power 
Center. Between those visits to Michigan, the 
Japanese dance group has performed in over 
700 cities and 48 countries worldwide. 
That may be a lot of travel, but Artistic 
Director and Choreographer Ushio Amagatsu 
is not tired by his international reception. 
In an email interview, he told The Daily that 
he has found a “universality” between those 
hundreds of different microcultures, writing 
that “this difference composes a culture” of 
its own. 
He uses this concept to continue his ongoing 
fomentation of the Butoh dance style. 
Born in the aftermath of Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki’s atomic bombings, Butoh is not 
loved for its prettiness. Instead, the dance 
form garners attention for its grotesque 
imagery 
and 
uncomfortable 
movements. 
Dancers use Butoh’s uneasy nature to bring 
attention to darker and more complex aspects 
of modern Japanese culture. When Amagatsu 
founded Sankai Juku in 1975, he melded that 
history with his training from other dance 
techniques to create the second generation of 
Butoh that we see today. His group performs 
with the traditional head-to-toe white body 
makeup and shaved heads, and the effect 
draws dramatic lines between the dancers 
and the negative space that surrounds them. 
Using this contrast, performers move 

through 
undulations 
in 
a 
process 
that 
Amagatsu describes as “conformity with 
gravity.” Some claim the result is simply slow-
motion movement, but Amagatsu disagrees. In 
his email, he took care to point out that “it’s 
the careful correspondence with gravity.” 
That hyper-control is far more distinct than 
a description of speed, and the effects are far 
more powerful. Even through the video clips 
on the UMS website, the performances leaves 
your heart feeling uncommonly still. 
This weekend, the group will perform 
“Meguri: Teeming Sea, Tranquil Land,” 
a work that found its inspiration in a bio-
history book that Amagatsu read. The work 
first premiered in Paris in 2015 and focuses 
on the rhythmic repetitions of earthly 
processes. Given his childhood spent by the 
ocean, Amagatsu added that he’s especially 
interested in the “boundary between land 
and sea.” In the work, dancers focus on the 
universality and timeless nature of oceanic 
processes, which Amagatsu connected to 
the “universality beyond the differences of 
cultures” that he has found through his years 
spent abroad. 
“It is difficult to explain the details (of that 
simplicity) in words. The image in my mind 
leads me to construct a creation,” Amagatsu 
said. With that, he touched on the very 
essence of dance; conveying a concept that 
comes from deep within. Though we often 
share these ideas or feelings with everyone 
around us, they often sit untouched until a 
dancer comes along to uncover them. 

‘Meguri’ to bring culture
and feeling through dance

ZOE PHILLIPS
For The Daily

It’s not often that a man just shy of 80 has the 
energy of a twenty-something. It’s especially rare 
for that man, famed jazz pianist Chick Corea, to 
have continued touring through his later years, just 
as excited to perform as he was at the beginning 
of his career. In fact, when I sat in Hill Auditorium 
Saturday night to hear him perform with bassist 
Christian McBride and percussionist Brian Bladee, I 
couldn’t quite put my finger on his age at all. 
Corea seemed to transcend any expectations the 
audience may have had for him, bounding out onto 
the stage in jeans, sneakers and a striped t-shirt that 
I swear my 14-year-old brother also owns. For the 
legendary musician, it was clear that age, looks and 
anything else superficial doesn’t actually matter 
in the long run — for him, it’s the music that really 
makes the difference. 
They began with a typical tune-up of their 
instruments, until Corea began to riff around with the 
audience. “We’re just gonna tune our instruments up 
real quick,” he chuckled, “then we’ll tune you all up, 
too.” The quip led to a burble from the audience, and 
as soon as the three musicians finished perfecting 
their respective instruments, Corea turned to them, 
mischievous smile across his face. He played a riff on 
the piano, then waited patiently for those seated in 
the auditorium to repeat it. They did, and on and on 
until we were all buckled over with laughter. It wasn’t 
until then that I realized how full Hill was that night, 
as the voices of everyone from the front row to the 
back of the balcony echoed into the space. 
The concert was a special performance to support 
the trilogy’s newest album, Trilogy 2, which follows 
a 2014 collaboration between the three that won two 
Grammys that year. The title of that one? You guessed 
it: Trilogy. All three of the musicians have a penchant 
for finding beauty in simplicity, but also in a contained 
chaos that jazz thrives on. There is power in restraint 
with modern jazz improvisation, and Corea, McBride 
and Blade know this all too well. 
Despite that fact, they seem to make the craziest 
riffs seem simple in their own right, moving from 
chord to chord with a cascade of notes that seem to 
appear out of thin air, much less produced by human 
hands. But that’s the magic of their collaboration: 
Though the group is listed as the Chick Corea Trio, 
they could easily be the Christian McBride Trio or 
very believably the Brian Blade Trio. They are all 
musicians at the top of their game and the second act 
of their careers, resting comfortably in their status as 
jazz greats. 
Beginning with classic Corea composition “La 
Fiesta” and moving between renditions of other 
songs like Duke Ellington’s “In a Sentimental Mood” 
and Thelonious Monk’s “Work,” the performance 
was widely varied in its creative choices. It seemed 

like the three were close enough to not even have a 
tracklist, as Corea stood up from his grand piano to 
murmur with the other two before each song was 
decided. But that spirit of off-the-cuff ingenuity is 
what made the trio stand out on the stage, as each of 
them held up their part with a nearly effortless talent. 
To put it simply, the trio are all monsters of 
jazz, imbued the creativity that comes from years 
of practice with the best of the best. Beyond that 
irreproachable savvy for music, they’re some of the 
coolest guys you could ever be in the same room 
with. I was stunned by everything they mentioned in 
between songs, the intention that every word came 
with, and also Brian Blade’s incredible baritone voice. 
The same goes for McBride’s skills with the bow, a 
special, almost classical interlude in a sea of straight 
jazz. 
The shimmering cymbals and undulating bass 
tones of the group flowed freely through the 
auditorium’s rapt audience, and at one point Corea 
even played the strings inside the piano to complete 
a composition’s otherworldly sound. When the three 
came out for an unexpected encore, my heart lifted 
with delight. They played a Coltrane composition, the 
simplest, most classic sound to round out the night. 
From the craziness of the last two hours, it was a 
beautiful example of their love for jazz in all its forms, 
especially those that put them where they are today. 
The night was a perfect example of what can happen 
when friendship and genius come together, creating a 
partnership in which innovation can flourish.

Chick Corea & co. aged well

If you were a teenager between 2010 and 
2016, you’ve probably been caught with the 
smoky cover of John Green’s “Looking for 
Alaska” propped open on your lap. It’s the now-
classic tale of the skinny loner at a new school 
who gets mesmerized by the mystifying girl 
with the strange name, only to have his friend 
group rocked by tragedy. The book is filled 
with cigarettes, books, sexual promiscuity and 
pranks. It’s halved in two sections — “Before” 
and “After” — centered around the tragedy. 
Fortunately, all of this finds its way into this 
aesthetically-polished adaptation for television.
Miles Halter (Charlie Plummer, “Granite 
Flats”) knows famous peoples’ last words. 
Anyone could quiz him on them. But no one 
would because he’s a bit of a loner. So, he 
leaves Orlando, Florida for Culver Creek, a 
boarding school in Alabama, trading beaches 
for sweat and oak trees, so that he can “seek a 
Great Perhaps,” in the final words of François 
Rabelais. There, his roommate — The Colonel 
(Denny Love, “Lucifer”) — shows him the ropes 
of Culver Creek. This brings him to Alaska 
Young (Kristine Froseth, “Sierra Burgess Is 
a Loser”), the troubled yet alluring girl with a 
room full of books and a knack for trouble. 
The 
first 
episode 
follows 
the 
Colonel 
instructing Miles (dubbed “Pudge,” for his slim 
physique) how to smoke. But when Alaska’s 
roommate gets kicked out for drinking, smoking 
and “genital contact,” drinking and smoking, 
the Weekday Warriors — a collection of rich 
students who go home on the weekends — think 
someone ratted on her and her boyfriend, and 

they mean to make them pay. So they go after 
Pudge.
“Looking for Alaska” takes place in 2005, but 
it certainly doesn’t feel like 2005. Everything 
about the show — from what the kids are wearing 
to the music featured — feels very modern. At 
first, this felt like a bad thing. It felt wrong, 
lacking the grungy, sweatiness of puberty that 
the novel so eloquently utilized to its advantage. 
It almost felt fake, too polished and false for 
the kind of emotions the novel induced. Hulu’s 
“Looking for Alaska” did not feel like the one 
I grew up adoring, then growing out of, then 
loathing.
Realizing this made me understand that the 
show wasn’t meant to feel like the “Looking 
for Alaska” that helped usher me through 
adolescence. The unfortunate fact of adulthood 
is very much upon me. If the same is true of you, 
then you, with the dog-eared, creased-spined 
copy tucked discreetly in the back of your 
bookcase, will also not see yourself in any of the 
main troublemakers of Hulu’s version.
But after coming to terms with my youth’s 
mortality, it became evident that “Looking 
for Alaska” serves much the same purpose for 
modern disgruntled teenagers that it did for 
the ones of yesterday. For all its sleekness and 
freshness, “Looking for Alaska” does resemble 
its source material in many ways. It is still the 
same story with the same message, stylized in 
its “Before” and “After” chapters. It also suffers 
from the same pretentiousness that plagued the 
novel. Ultimately, whether or not “Looking for 
Alaska” is good depends purely on where you’re 
at in life. If you’re older than the novel’s target 
audience, the show will fall flat. But if the novel 
currently has you torn to pieces, the show will 
be a great supplement.

We’re all living cable free, right? We’re the 
digital generation, we cut the cords, we use 
streaming services and we don’t pay for cable. 
But would we be better off if we did? While fewer 
college students have cable subscriptions than 
in the past, I would hazard a guess that most 
still watch an impressive amount of television. 
Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Roku, YouTube 
TV, CBS All Access, Apple TV, HBO Go, soon 
Disney+ and more; the number of streaming 
services continues to increase year after year 
and the ways in which people of our generation 
pay for the right to watch slowly become more 
and more convoluted.
In many college units, at least one of the 
aforementioned services is being provided 
by a parental unit of some member of the 
household. How long will that last, though? 
My generation has slowly come to expect that 
all forms of media will be provided for them 
for free, but that’s not reasonable for the 
entertainment industry or a given consumer. 
Surely, Netflix and HBO know how many 
people share their accounts with each other, 
right? Is this something technology can stop, 
or is it simply a matter of time before this 
entire ecosystem begins to resemble the cable 
packages that everyone so despised?
No one knows for sure what the streaming 
landscape will look like in a few years, but 
most are in agreement that consumers are 
not going to shell out five to 10 dollars per 
network they want. Bundled streaming deals 
feel inevitable, and when they do come, it will 
be right back to where we started. Sports in 
particular have a difficult road ahead. Last year 
it was estimated that the NBA is losing billions 

of dollars a year on people illegally streaming 
the league’s games through sites as open and 
accessible as Reddit. Personally, I used to use 
r/cfbstreams all the time to watch college 
football games that weren’t being aired on 
a network someone in my house had access 
to. This fall, Reddit seems to have cracked 
down on the existence of threads like that, 
which just funnel people to illegal streaming 
sites, costing the corporate content creators 
boatloads of money.
I think one of the main reasons streaming 
is so prevalent is that it feels like a victimless 
crime. ESPN doesn’t need more of my money, 
nor does Disney, Warner Bros or any of the 
rest. Is it really so bad so deprive them of 
my five dollars so I can watch Michigan play 
a basketball game at Illinois? This is pure 
speculation, but I suspect many people who 
are guilty of illegally streaming would never 
consider stealing so much as a candy bar from 
a Walgreens. In reality, illegally streaming 
content is just as much of crime and just as 
much of a theft as stealing a candy bar is, but 
it doesn’t feel that way. Stealing from a store 
feels like stealing, whereas illegally streaming 
something from a billion dollar corporation 
feels like getting one over the man.
Even film majors like myself have seemingly 
little moral issue stealing films and TV show 
files from the internet and costing content 
creators money, despite the fact that they 
themselves one day hope to be the ones creating 
the content. Surely at that point we will hope 
that illegal streaming has been limited or 
erased entirely. Surely then we will see that 
what we are doing is wrong ... maybe. But until 
then, I’m going to keep watching Netflix on my 
parents’ account and borrowing CBS access 
from my roommate. I don’t need to pay money 
to watch the Lions lose on Sunday — I’ve got 
enough problems as it is.

None of us have cable, OK?

Raise the ruff!
It’s Friday!!!

Kero Kero Bonito is on a hot streak. The British indie-
pop trio has spent the last year radiating big suburban 
energy with the nostalgic Time ‘N’ Place, and has since 
widened their sights with Civilisation I, dropping right 
before their North American tour. If Bonito Generation 
was a celebration of inner childhood cheer and Time ‘N’ 
Place was a reflection of early-adulthood melancholy, 
Civilisation I is a grimdark mourning of society’s 
imminent implosion. I can think of no better tunes to 
get down to in Detroit than KKB’s new über-doomer 
anthems.
It’s the night of Oct. 16, and I stroll into the Magic Stick 
with my concert companion. For some reason venue 
security is not taking shit from nobody tonight. The box 
office is past the security check, so I get big X’s magic 
marker’d onto both my under-21 hands and get badgered 
for my camera bag before finally getting a press ticket and 
entering the venue.
The 
concert 
opens 
with 
a 
performance from 
Negative 
Gemini. 
She’s 
only 
got 
30,000 
monthly 
listeners on Spotify 
but the crowd is 
dancing like she’s 
got 30 million. This 
is a testament to 
the loveliness of her 
groovy electropop. 
It’s 
genuinely 
dreamy 
and 
I 
contemplate getting 
some of her merch 
(it 
looks 
pretty 
cool).
Between 
performances, 
I 
nervously inch my 
way through the 
tightly packed crowd, hoping to get a picture when the 
band comes on. But I’m shy and I’m nervous and this is my 
first time trying photo coverage so I stop before getting 
to the front row. I don’t want to take space from the 
superfans who probably lined up long before the doors 
opened to secure their spots. A group watches me fumble 
with my camera, trying to find a good angle between the 
shoulders of two people much taller than myself, before 
motioning for me to fill in between them. They are all full 
of smiles and encouragement for my concert coverage as 
the band takes the stage.
In addition to their core members — Sarah Bonito on 
vocals, Gus Lobban on keys and Jamie Bulled on bass — 
guitarist James Rowland and drummer Jennie Walton 
join the band’s live performances. Except for Sarah, the 
band enters the stage to a steady roar. 30 seconds later, 
Sarah saunters in to the tune of hundreds of screaming 
fans. It suddenly occurs to me that I forgot earplugs. I 
think I need them more for the screaming than the music.
The show opens with the foreboding bopper 
“Battlelines” and the world is indeed ending, so we have 
every reason to get down. At any given moment there is 

also good reason to scream, cry, laugh or all three at once. 
Sarah holds a stuffed flamingo as she raps “Flamingo,” 
waving it tauntingly over the crowd. Another stuffed 
animal graces the stage, this time a crocodile during 
“Pocket Crocodile.” Gus, rocking a Bob Evans baseball 
cap, is full of goofy quips and banter. “This one’s dedicated 
to the Detroit People Mover,” he says before one song. 
Sarah enlists the crowd to sing happy birthday to Jennie. 
A fan’s phone ends up on stage, and the band responds by 
taking a crowd selfie with it. There’s one thing I witness 
that makes my life complete: Gus and Sarah perform the 
iconic voicemail interlude from “Break,” complete with a 
pink prop telephone.
At this point, I think nothing could make my heart 
more full. Then Sarah calls for a joint performance by 
the “KKB and Detroit choir” to do a heartfelt singalong 
to “Sometimes.” As she stands over the crowd with her 
baton, a cluster of devout fans (myself included) cram 
beneath her waving arms, belting every last lyric. Jamie 
even dances a jolly jig onstage. I don’t notice it at first — 
I can’t see it behind the outstretched arms of a group 
of fans recording the scene — but I witness Jamie’s 
goofiness through 
the cameras of their 
raised phones. My 
heart overflows.
Much 
of 
the 
band’s 
charm 
comes 
from 
the 
glossy twinkles and 
chimes 
peppered 
throughout 
their 
production that are 
difficult to replicate 
live, but this does 
not stop KKB. The 
band is as faithful 
as could be to their 
quirky 
sample-
filled sound. They 
even recreate the 
cacophonous noise 
breakdown of “Only 
Acting.” It speaks to 
their creativity and 
the strength of their relationships with their instruments.
The band gives their goodbyes after “Picture This,” 
but Detroit would not walk away without hearing their 
favorite song. When the chants begin — “TRAMPOLINE! 
TRAMPOLINE! TRAMPOLINE!” — they will not stop 
until the band returns. Sure enough, they waltz back 
onstage and blast into a cover of U2’s “Vertigo.” In a cute 
homage to Detroit, James plays the opening to Eminem’s 
“Lose Yourself” on guitar. Finally, “Trampoline” begins, 
and the floor of the venue flexes to an alarming degree 
as the crowd bounces, but I cannot stop jumping and 
jumping and jumping.
All my energy has been jumped out of me. I walk out of 
the venue into rainy weather and a $45 parking ticket, but 
no amount of rain (or financial misfortune) can drown 
the joy and elation that is post-KKB-concert bliss. Kero 
Kero Bonito just made a goddamn bounce house out of 
Detroit, and I am humbled by their wholesomeness. My 
co-concertgoer and I scroll through pictures in the car. 
Most of them are ones she took of me shedding tears 
during the “Sometimes” singalong. Come back soon, 
KKB, I think to myself. Come back soon.

Kero Kero Bonito brings
love and light to Detroit

CONCERT REVIEW
BOOK REVIEW

One thing that I retained from my introductory 
psychology class was that memory, which I believed 
was somewhat permanent, is unreliable. Take 
cognitive psychologist Elizabeth Loftus’s famous 
car experiment for example. In it, participants 
watched a car crash. The participants had to estimate 
the car’s speed. Loftus was able to manipulate the 
participants responses by framing her questions. 
By using adjectives that described a severe crash, 
Loftus found that participants were more likely to 
report the car traveling faster than it actually was. 
Just as I started to deconstruct everything I learned 
from “Law and Order,” we discussed false memories, 
and, in the ways that Loftus was able to retroactively 
influence the perception of certain events, James 
Coan demonstrated that people can claim to recall 
entire events from their childhood that were false. 
What happens if we can make memories disappear 
altogether? 
Described as a “haunting Orwellian novel,” Yoko 
Ogawa’s “The Memory Police” imagines a dystopian 
island where memories of certain objects disappear. 
First, ribbons, bells, emeralds and stamps go. Then, 
perfume, photographs and even birds. After a day of 
commemoration, most of the island’s inhabitants are 
unaffected by these changes. They don’t even notice 

that these seemingly insignificant objects are gone. 
For example, when the narrator, a struggling novelist, 
experiences perfume after it disappeared, she cannot 
reconcile it to anything more than a “few drops of 
water.” 
“Some girls held the bottles up to their noses one last 
time — but the ability to smell the perfume had already 
faded, along with all memory of what it had meant. 
The river reeked for two or three days afterward, and 
some fish died. But no one seemed to notice. You see, 
the very idea of ‘perfume’ had been disappeared from 
their heads.”
That precious memory, and everything that it 
entailed, is gone forever. The authoritative Memory 
Police ensures that no one ever recalls these objects 
again — even if they have to make people disappear, 
too. 
After the young woman discovers that her editor, 
R, can still remember these objects even after they 
had disappeared, she goes to great lengths to hide him 
from the Memory Police. As more and more people 
that the narrator is close to begin to vanish, the thrill 
intensifies as the readers are left wondering if R will 
meet the same fate. 
For a novel described as “Orwellian,” the “The 
Memory Police” was surprisingly slow. Each word 
was carefully plucked to convey the most meaning. It 
was like the “Memory Police” was embodying its own 
themes, worrying that it, too, may fade over time. Even 
paragraphs were powerful in a particular way, laden 
with nostalgia and sentimentality. Right before the 
narrator hides R, R tries to describe his memories of 
the objects that had already disappeared:
“Even if they fade, something remains. Like tiny 
seeds that might germinate again if the rain falls. And 
even if a memory disappears completely, the heart 
retains something. A slight tremor or pain, some bit of 
joy, a tear.”
Without question, the prose is lovely. I found myself 
pausing between chapters in order to absorb the 
provocative themes. And still, I never felt a compulsion 
to finish. Unlike George Orwell’s “1984,” I did not feel 
as threatened by the Memory Police as I did by Big 
Brother. From the beginning to the end, “The Memory 
Police” was quiet. It relied on a slow-burn climatic 
setup that did not pack a punch as masterfully as 
other dystopias manage to. I wanted my mind to be 
psychologically warped. I wanted to apply its heavy 
surveillance to real-world situations, condemning the 
NSA in my head. It’s easy to appreciate “The Memory 
Police” for its prose, less so for its plot.

‘Memory’ falls just short

PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE

Basement Arts broke from tradition this year 
and opened their new season not with a play 
or musical, but with their brand new “Latinx: 
Caberéy.” Directed by School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance senior Lauren Kenner with assistance 
from SMTD sophomores Ruby Pérez and Sammie 
Estrella, this performance gave Latinx identifying 
students the chance to share the pride in their 
culture with peers.
In a night full of singing, dancing, poetry and 
virgin margaritas, everyone was alive with energy 
and enthusiasm. Before even entering the small 
studio, theatre-goers were offered a feast of Latinx 
cuisine. Inside the studio, the set, designed by 
Stamps sophomore Ryan Espitia, was vibrant and 
homey, welcoming in the audience with bright 
blankets and warm lights. The loving atmosphere 
made the audience feel welcomed into the space 
and involved in the show.
“Caberéy” included a variety of acts: Songs 
ranged from traditional Spanish lullabies to 
“Hamilton” ballads. Traditional Latin dances 
were both performed and taught to the crowd, 
and poignant poems were written by the students. 
Some of the highlights include SMTD senior 
Maya Ballester 
and 
SMTD 
junior Cristina 
Holder’s 
rendition 
of 
“Remember 
Me” from the 
movie 
“Coco,” 
a beautiful duet 
incorporating 
both 
Spanish 
and 
English 
lyrics, 
and 
SMTD 
sophomore 
Sammie 
Estrella’s poem 
“Little 
Brown 
Hands,” a piece 
about 
growing 
up Latinx.

Basement Arts provided a space for the 
voices of underrepresented artists to soar. They 
featured artists from different Latinx countries 
and different backgrounds. In a stunning finale, 
each artist spoke their name and the culture that 
they identify with, proving that Latinx culture 
conforms to no ideals and knows no boundaries.
Not only was this show necessary and important, 
but it was fun. Whether gasping at a gut-wrenching 
poem or clapping to a spirited Spanish song, 
everyone was engaged and enjoying every minute. 
Each performance illuminated a different aspect 
of Latinx culture; some songs were in Spanish, 
some songs were written by Latinx composers and 
poems spoke to different facets of what it means to 
identify as a Latinx artist.
What made the night so powerful was the 
coming together of all of these unique artists and 
experiences to celebrate a common culture. For 
the artists involved, it was an opportunity to bond 
over a commonality that society doesn’t always 
allow them embrace. For the audience, it was a 
chance to deepen our understanding of a likely 
unfamiliar culture. Everyone needs the chance to 
be introduced to these conversations to perpetrate 
growth and understanding in our society.
Opening the season with such a powerful 
statement on inclusivity within the theatre opens 
Basement Arts up for further conversations about 
important 
topics. 
This 
show gave those 
in the Latinx 
community 
a 
place 
to 
use 
their voices and 
those 
not 
in 
the community 
a 
place 
to 
listen. 
Seeing 
Basement Arts 
on 
the 
track 
to 
inclusivity 
gives us hope 
for more events 
like this in the 
future 
and 
a 
more inclusive 
theatre 
community.

‘Caberéy’ was illuminating

After its second loss of the season de facto eliminated Michigan from 
College Football Playoff contention and takes the Big Ten out of the 
Wolverines’ hands, Notre Dame comes to Ann Arbor to renew one 
of college football’s oldest rivalries. The two will play under the lights 
at Michigan Stadium, bringing back memories of the classic 2011 
matchup, as Michigan attempts to salvage its season by beating the 
first of three rivals — the Irish, Michigan State and Ohio State — still 
on the schedule.

A look back at the 2011 Under the Lights 
matchup against Notre Dame.

Middle Tennessee State (Aug. 31): Look man, 
the middle of Tennessee is decidedly not a state.

Army (Sept. 7): The Army football team: The 
only time running behind enemy lines is a good 
idea.

Penn State (Oct. 19): Hey, Mike.

Notre Dame (Oct. 26): You think beating Mich-
igan is special? Everyone’s doing it these days!

Maryland (Nov. 2): Maybe Mike Locksley and 
Josh Gattis shouldn’t have been so quick to fight 
over credit for their offense after all.

Wisconsin (Sept. 21): Sure, your town is sick 
and your beer is elite but you lost to Illinois and 
Michigan didn’t. So there!

Michigan State (Nov. 16): The Michigan Daily 
has beaten The State News 14 years in a row.
Rutgers (Sept. 28): My grandma’s New Jersey 
retirement home mahjong group could beat Rut-
gers in football ... basketball would be close, too.

Iowa (Oct. 5): The year is 2080. Aliens have 
taken over. Iowa capped off a 7-5 season with a 
five-year extension for Kirk Ferentz. All is well.

Illinois (Oct. 12): It turns out Lovie Smith does 
still have a pulse!

Ohio State (Nov. 30): Do you think Justin 
Fields can play The Game online, too?

Indiana (Nov. 23): Hoosier favorite to be the 
next head coach of this supremely mediocre 
program?

M

ichigan won’t make the 
College Football Playoff 
this year. It hasn’t been 
statistically eliminated from the Big 
Ten, but for now, its chances of a 
conference title 
reside on tech-
nicalities and 
blind hope.
Those were 
the goals the 
Wolverines har-
bored before the 
season started, 
the goals they 
kept clinging 
onto after Wis-
consin blitzed them in Madison last 
month.
“We know that we’re gonna see 
them again in my hometown, for the 
Big Ten championship,” said redshirt 
freshman linebacker Cam McGrone 
a week after that loss. “I don’t really 
mind hearing it, cause I know when 
we see them again, we’re gonna 
smack ‘em in the mouth.”
Barring an unforeseen charge by 
Michigan and multiple slip-ups from 
Ohio State and Penn State, that’s not 
going to happen. 
“Win our next game,” Jim Har-
baugh said this week when asked 
what would make a successful sea-

son. “That’s our goal.”
There’s not much else to say at this 
point. There is no big-picture goal 
because all of those evaporated into 
the State College night last Saturday. 
As far as front-facing public declara-
tions go, brash statements have been 
beaten out of the Wolverines.
That doesn’t mean there’s nothing 
to salvage for the season. The gulf 
between 7-5 and 10-2 is still wide, 
both in terms of public perception 
and of what this season will mean 
to those inside Schembechler Hall. 
Michigan, in many ways, is playing 
only for itself at this point. That’s not 
nothing.
Much as everything with this 
program centers around Harbaugh’s 
record on the road against ranked 
teams — the record that ultimately 
brought down his team this year — 
he still has the opportunity to notch 
wins against Michigan’s rivals. He 
has yet to beat Ohio State in four 
tries. He lost in his first matchup 
against Notre Dame last year. He has 
yet to beat Michigan State at home, 
with a lackluster 2-2 record against 
the Spartans.
That adds up to a 2-7 record 
against Michigan’s biggest rivals, 
despite the Wolverines being favored 
in six of those nine games. As far as 

reversing narratives go, there’s still a 
pretty big one staring Harbaugh, and 
Michigan, in the face.
Much as the Wolverines have 
disappointed this year, all three of 
those games are at home. Winning 
all of them is a tall order, especially 
with Ohio State looking like one of 
the best teams in the country. Notre 
Dame and the Buckeyes are both top-
10 teams. But beat them and nobody 
will go into the offseason feeling 
apprehensive about Josh Gattis as 
offensive coordinator, and nobody 
will feel anything but good about 
2020. Do that and Michigan can claw 
its way to a New Year’s Six bowl, 
giving way to unfounded optimism 
around the program.
If the Wolverines take moral 
victories against those three teams, 
they’ll have their worst season since 
2014, when they went 5-7, missed a 
bowl game and fired Brady Hoke. 
That’s what these next six weeks 
mean. 
No equivocating. Not if Michigan 
wants to be considered a top-tier 
program.
“Do you define struggling as, 
are you winning the games? If you 
look at it in terms of winning, yeah, 
I guess our record doesn’t really 
reflect everything that goes into it,” 

said Carlo Kemp when asked about 
struggles against top-10 teams this 
week. “... But we fought (against Penn 
State). We fought our way all the way 
back to present ourselves with an 
opportunity to win the game. And 
the score of the game and the records 
of those ranked matchups that you’re 
talking about, they don’t reflect that. 
And it’s a curse and it’s a blessing. It 
doesn’t reflect everything that goes 
into those games and the preparation 
and how they’ve been on your mind 
since the last time you played them 
or the last time you lost to them. 
“Sometimes, they don’t go your 
way. But you don’t document the 
fight or the good plays and the posi-
tives of those games. The only thing 
that gets reported is the score and 
the record.”
It might be wrong to say that 
Michigan struggled at Penn State 
when it had a chance to tie the game 
at the 3-yard line and force overtime. 
But there is no doubt that Michigan 
has struggled to win these kinds of 
games. Fair or not, that’s what mat-
ters in the end.
Most of Michigan’s players and 
coaches fell into Harbaugh’s rheto-
ric — “win our next game” — when 
asked about bigger-picture goals this 
week. It fell to senior quarterback 

Shea Patterson to expand on that.
“We have an opportunity,” Pat-
terson said. “We have a decision 
to make. Our goal is to win every 
game the rest of the season. I love 
this team. We’re all so close, and we 
trust each other, and we love playing 
together. I don’t think there is any 
other goal than to just win.”
Do that, and this season will feel 
a whole lot different at the end of 
November than it does right now.

Shaun Nua knew something was wrong.
A hard cast stretched from his hip to his foot, but 
beneath it, the swelling had become unbearable. 
A few days earlier, he had been in the back of a 
coach’s Toyota pickup truck, speeding from foot-
ball practice to the nearest hospital.
This was the reality of American Samoa in 1998. 
Nua is careful to note that it’s not a third-world 
country. Food, as his 6-foot-5, 240-pound frame 
attests to, was never short. But life there is simple. 
When he attempts to describe the islands to an 
outsider, the first comparison his mind drifts to is 
the show Survivor, before acknowledging, “it’s not 
as bad.”
So by 1998, when Nua was 17, few modern medi-
cal advancements had reached the islands. A pick-
up truck was the delivery method of choice for 
incoming hospital patients and, more importantly, 
there was no way to diagnose a torn ACL — Nua’s 
injury.
“I had no idea what an ACL was or what any of 
that was,” Nua told The Daily. “I was just like, ‘My 
leg is broken.’ It was a numbing, burning feeling so 
they put me in the back of a truck and took me to 
the hospital.”
Leaning into a black leather chair inside Schem-
bechler Hall’s second-floor lounge — 21 years and 
7,000 miles away from Tafuna High School — 
Nua can’t remember who asked him the question 
that changed his life: “Don’t you cast only broken 
bones?” What he does remember is his response.
By that point, Nua knew he hadn’t broken his leg. 
So with the pain becoming unbearable, he came 
up with his own remedy: boiling a pot of water, 
pouring it on his leg and cutting the cast off.
Seven years later, he won the Super Bowl.
“Man,” Nua said. “I’m telling you, my story’s 
crazy.”
***

By his senior year of high school, football con-
sumed Nua’s life. Growing up with his grandpar-
ents, he discovered the sport on a trip to go see 
his parents on Tutuila, American Samoa’s main 
island.
“I wanted to watch Smurfs sometimes, but (my 
dad) would turn on football,” Nua said. “Football, 
football, football. And that got ingrained in my 
head. I was like, I want to play that sport.”
In American Samoa, though, there’s no Pop War-
ner or Little League football. The game, in its offi-
cial form, starts in high school.
Immediately, it was all Nua wanted to do. He 
hadn’t yet committed to a position, playing quar-
terback, tight end and defensive line, but going 
into his senior season, the Division I interest had 
started to arrive, awed by his imposing frame.
Then came the injury.
“It was probably the darkest time in my life,” Nua 
said. “Cause that was everything to me, was trying 
to get a football scholarship. I wanted to play Divi-
sion I football. I wanted to play football, period.”
So, even with his leg boiling beneath a cast, Nua 
couldn’t let the game slip away.
After a year of hobbling around on crutches, he 
graduated and moved to live with his aunt in 
Hawaii, where he could get a proper diagnosis and 
surgery. Six months later, he continued on to Ari-
zona to live with his sister.
That’s where he thought his football career would 
take off. But the early results didn’t cooperate. It 
didn’t matter where he tried out — Scottsdale 
Community College, Phoenix Community Col-
lege, Mesa Community College — no school would 
take him.
“It was discouraging, but I was so convinced that 
I was meant to be a football player,” Nua said. “So 
convinced, like nothing was going to stop me from 
becoming a football player. The only question was 

when was the opportunity going to come. And 
that’s when Tom Ellsworth came in.”
Twenty years later, Ellsworth — a renowned ath-
letic trainer in the Phoenix area — is only willing 
to accept credit for three of his patients’ athletic 
careers. Nua is one of them.
An aunt whom Nua lived near in Phoenix put him 
in contact with Ellsworth to continue his ACL 
rehab. Within three weeks, it became clear he 
needed a second surgery. The problem is, this was 
in late February 2000. His surgery was the first 
week of March. Football season starts in August. 
That’s not a timetable that usually lines up.
By early April, Ellsworth had a sense Nua was the 
exception.
“When you get around (elite athletes), you just 
know,” Ellsworth said. “You know when some-
body has it. He’s athletic, he’s huge and he’s hun-
gry. And he wants to play football.”
Ellsworth worked his contacts, calling Scott 
Giles, the head coach at Eastern Arizona College, 
a small-town community college 160 miles east of 
Phoenix.
After one glimpse of Nua, Giles was swayed.
“I knew he was a Division I athlete just based on 
his physical presence,” Giles said. “He is just a 
mountain of a man.”
***
For most players, the first drive to Eastern Arizona 
is a moment of reckoning. It’s a three-hour drive 
from Phoenix, through a canyon, an Indian reser-
vation and very few traces of civilization.
The only things emerging from the desert land-
scape are a Walmart and a few Mexican restau-
rants. There used to be a K-Mart, but that’s closed 
since Nua left.
“Even a place like Thatcher was still — it had still 
modern stuff compared to where I came from,” 
Nua said. “Like the Walmart was like, ‘Wow’ to 

me.”
It was in Thatcher that the big-
ger names started to come calling. 
According to Eastern Arizona’s then-
defensive coordinator Kalani Sitake 
— now the head coach at BYU — Nua 
had offers from Pac-10, Big 12 and Big 
Ten schools.
But in Thatcher, Nua had found 
something comfortable.
Eastern Arizona had established 
itself as a feeder school for Polyne-
sian players not yet ready for Division 
I football. In any given year, Giles 
estimates they had five to eight play-
ers from the islands — a significant 
number for the smaller roster sizes 
of JUCO.
“Any time you’re around people with 
the same mindset and the same cul-
ture, it makes everything easy,” Nua 
said. “You eat the same food, you 
cook the same way, you dress the 
same way. And the communication, 
you have someone to talk to. It makes 
it easy.”
As a born Tongan who moved to 
Hawaii when he was eight, Sitake 
quickly developed a unique player-
coach relationship with Nua.
“From the beginning, being both 
islanders, we knew each other’s cul-
ture and ability for us to share and 
hang out and really connect, it was 
not even a problem,” Sitake said. 
“Once we met, it was like it was 
meant to be. He’s like a little brother 
to me.”

Nua didn’t convert to Mormonism until later, but 
Sitake had graduated from BYU a year earlier and 
knew it would be a good fit. At the time, it was 
among the schools on the forefront of Polynesian 
recruiting, creating a similar environment to what 
Giles — another BYU graduate — had fostered at 
Eastern Arizona. That, combined with the unique 
ability to focus on football, pushed Nua over the 
edge.
“We just talked specifically about the distrac-
tions,” Sitake said. “He came from the islands and 
then when he went to Arizona, he was in Thatcher 
so it’s not like there were a lot of distractions there 
either. And he flourished. So we talked about it 
quite a bit and he knew.”
***
Five years after graduating to an NFL career in 
2004, Nua found himself back at BYU, back in a 
stats class, back in a world he had left behind.
This time, it was to be a graduate assistant coach 
on Bronco Mendenhall’s staff.
Through a stroke of good fortune and his own pre-
paredness, that’s where Ken Nuimatololo found 
him. Nuimatololo, Navy’s head coach, had a son at 
BYU at the time, allowing him to watch the Cou-
gars practice. He was there simply to be a dad, but 
football coaches have a hard time compartmen-
talizing that. Nua’s enthusiasm on the sidelines 
immediately brought his coaching side out.
“I loved his energy, I loved the way he coached,” 
Nuimatololo said. “… He kinda stood out to me as 
I was watching practice so I watched him a little 
more and I remember just telling my wife … ‘If I 
ever get an opportunity to hire a D-line coach, I’m 
gonna hire Shaun Nua.’ ”
For Nua, it was the perfect opportunity. Nuimato-
lolo is the only Samoan head coach in Division I, 
continuing the trend of comfort in familiarity that 
began in Thatcher a decade earlier. He gave Nua 
someone to confide in as he adjusted to his first 
full-time coaching job as a Samoan in a profession 
devoid of them. “I feel like a proud dad,” Nuima-
tololo said.
In their six years together at Navy, the two devel-
oped a special bond, discussing their family mem-
bers back on the islands and even making a trip 
back to American Samoa together for a Troy Pola-
malu coaching clinic.
“Any time you’re from a small group of people, the 
pride that you have for each other is that much 
stronger,” Nua said. “Cause you’re representing a 
small group of people so you don’t want to disap-
point them.”
At Navy, Nua developed into one of the most 
sought-after young defensive line coaches in the 
country, even turning down an offer to reunite 
with Mendenhall at Virginia to stay on Nuimato-
lolo’s staff.
When Arizona State came calling in 2018, though, 
the Sun Devils offered something none of those 
previous offers could — proximity to family, allow-
ing Nua to limit his trips to see family to annual 
visits back to the islands. A year later, he had to 
leave that behind to come to Michigan, an offer 
that he called “too good to turn down.”
These days, he coaches in front of a crowd near-
ly twice the size of the island he came from. But 
even when he’s back home, in the 32-family village 
where he grew up, he doesn’t see himself as any 
more than a kid who made it out.
“You always want to have the mindset that you 
don’t think, ‘Oh, I’m a role model,’ ” Nua said.
Then, he paused, staring into the oversized block 
‘M’ adorning the wall in front of him.
“Maybe I am a role model,” Nua said. “I just hope 
I’m a good one.

Before the Wolverines took the 
field for the first-ever night game 
at Michigan Stadium in 2011, they 
heard from Desmond Howard and 
Charles Woodson.
The two Michigan legends talked 
about the importance of the rivalry 
with Notre Dame. They told the 
team about how to win big games 
like this. They said these were the 
types of matchups where legacies 
are made.
You 
probably 
know 
what 
happened next. Down by as much 
as 17, Michigan clawed its way back, 
capping off a comeback when Roy 
Roundtree jumped up and caught 
the ball in the corner of the end zone 
with two seconds left to lead to an 
improbable 35-31 win.
But not long after the traditional 
frenzy of the rivalry with the 
Fighting Irish reached its apex that 
night, Notre Dame canceled the 
series. The two teams added one 
more home-and-home — with the 
Fighting Irish’s portion last year 
and the Wolverines’ on Saturday 
— but after that, there are no more 
scheduled games between two of the 
oldest rivals in college football.
Though most members of the 
current Michigan team were in 
middle school — or even elementary 
school — during the original “Under 
the Lights,” the program today still 
has shades of that game. Roundtree is 
a member of the staff, helping coach 

wide receivers. Ed Warinner, Notre 
Dame’s offensive line coach in 2011, 
now holds the same position with 
the Wolverines. Pictures of scenes 
from the game can be found in the 
locker room, just before running into 
the tunnel, as well as the museum 
where press conferences are held 
and the press box.
That’s not even to mention that 
Saturday’s game kicks off at 7:30 
p.m., and while night games at the 
Big House are not nearly the novelty 
they were in 2011, there’s no question 
what people remember when they 
think about Michigan vs. Notre 
Dame under the lights.
It’s safe to say most Wolverines 
today are familiar with the legacy. 
But on Saturday, Michigan will have 
its last chance, at least for a while, to 
add their names to the legacy.
***
The original “Under the Lights” 
was about as hyped as a matchup 
between two unranked teams could 
possibly be. For all the shortcomings 
of 
then-athletic 
director 
Dave 
Brandon, he pulled out all the stops 
for that night. Both teams wore 1960s 
throwbacks and even the referees 
got in on the uniform nostalgia. 
There was a pep rally on the Diag. A 
special ceremony honoring Howard 
happened on the field before the 
game.
For two teams with such storied 
histories, 
neither 
was 
actually 
expected to be that good in 2011. 
Michigan was in its first season 
under Brady Hoke after three 

lackluster years of Rich Rodriguez. 
Notre Dame lost its opener to South 
Florida, of all teams. Despite that, 
College GameDay still ticketed the 
game as its featured matchup.
Maize 
pom-poms 
were 
distributed to nearly 115,000 fans 
— a record at the time and still 
the 
second-largest 
crowd 
ever 
assembled at the stadium. It was a 
crisp September day, not too hot, not 
too cold — perfect football weather. 
The excitement was palpable, and it 
was every bit the spectacle everyone 
had hoped.
“I think that’s probably the loudest 
I’ve ever heard the Big House, since 
I’ve been there,” then-Michigan 
quarterback Denard Robinson told 
The Daily. “Since I came afterwards, 
I think it’s the loudest I’ve ever heard 
the Big House.”
Robinson hated night games, 
because he’d get butterflies all day 
and come into the game too amped 
up. Day games didn’t give you as 
much time to think. Robinson still 
appreciated the atmosphere, the 
uniforms, the tradition, but his 
worry of being too anxious came to 
fruition, and the Wolverines came 
out playing sloppy.
They were down 24-7 at the start 
of the fourth quarter. Even their next 
touchdown came from a fumble at 
the goal line that Robinson picked up 
and ran in.
Somehow, 
Michigan 
found 
its groove and scored two more 
touchdowns in the quarter, but when 
the Fighting Irish got the ball back 

and scored with 30 seconds left, it 
seemed like the Wolverines’ death 
knell. To everyone but them.
“One thing about our team, we 
kinda chilled and got through well,” 
Robinson said. “We all had that same 
common goal and the seniors that 
year was some great seniors and we 
had great leaders on the team. We’d 
been through so much and if we 
could go win the game together, we 
could do anything together.
“ ... (We knew) we could win the 
game and no matter how much time 
was on the clock, we could win this. 
So when they left 30 seconds on the 
clock, I turned to them, I said, ‘That’s 
too much time.’ ”
Every Friday, Michigan practiced 
three plays for situations like this. In 
the waning seconds against Notre 
Dame, Hoke called two of them.
And after missing a wide-open 
Jeremy Gallon on first down, 
Robinson got a second shot. It was 
a different playcall, but the same 
uncovered Gallon. Robinson didn’t 
miss twice, and the play went for 64 
yards.
Down three, the Wolverines were 
playing for a field goal. But with eight 
seconds left, Robinson took one last 
shot.
Roundtree hadn’t been targeted 
all day. He turned to Robinson.
“I need the ball,” Roundtree said, 
according to Robinson.
Robinson responded: “I trust 
you.”
There was no time to doubt. 
Robinson had to get the ball out 

quickly so there was still time left 
to kick a field goal if the pass fell 
incomplete, and he couldn’t take a 
sack. So he found Roundtree in the 
corner of the end zone. Roundtree 
jumped up, and the rest was history.
“It was probably the loudest I ever 
heard the Big House,” Robinson said. 
“It reminded me of — I couldn’t hear 
myself. I couldn’t hear, everyone was 
yelling, ‘Get up! Get up! We gotta 
do our celebration!’ I couldn’t hear 
it. (Someone) was just grabbing me 
by the chest like, ‘Get up!’ I’m like, 
‘Alright, cool, I’ll get up,’ and I moved 
and it was like amazing.
“You can’t even put into words the 
feeling of what happened, and how 
you felt at that moment.”
***
The 
photo 
of 
Roundtree’s 
touchdown is immortalized now. It’s 
the first thing you see when you walk 
into the locker room from the tunnel.
Roundtree declined to comment 
for this story, but Michigan players 
say he still talks about the play 
sometimes — albeit as merely 
something that happened “back in 
his day.” Even eight years later, the 
history lingers.
“I get to work side by side for 
two years now with the guy who 
caught the pass on the last play to 
win the game,” Warinner said. “ … 
Just the angst that you have when 
it happened, but then, because I’m a 
part of Michigan culture now and I 
work with Roy, I’m like, ‘Man, what 
a great play!’ For the rest of his life, 
he’s a hero.”
The significance of the game — 
and the play in the pictures plastered 
everywhere — isn’t lost on the 
Wolverines. Neither is the gravity of 
the coming matchup.
Jim Harbaugh said Monday that 
he’d be open to resuming the rivalry, 
and that there are already discussions 
being had. Still, Michigan’s schedule 
is full through 2028, so even if there 
is an agreement, chances are the 
series is over for the near future.
That gives it even more weight 
in the eyes of the Wolverines, and 
Roundtree is there as a beacon of 
that same message Howard and 
Woodson gave him eight years ago.
“It’s historic and being able to 
be a part of this game coming up 
on Saturday,” said senior defensive 
tackle Carlo Kemp. “ … And one of the 
things that I think is really cool is, 
this game I don’t think is scheduled 
for a little bit, so there’s a chance to 
make a name for yourself, a name for 
this team, a name for the offense, a 
name for the defense, historically.
“And they can talk about what 
happened in this Michigan-Notre 
Dame game in 2019.”

What to watch for as No. 17 Michigan takes on No. 8 Notre Dame

We’re about to find out how long 
that hangover lasted.
There’s no rest for the weary, as 
No. 19 Michigan welcomes No. 8 
Notre Dame in a game that would 
have meant far more six weeks ago.
The Wolverines, as you likely 
know, suffered their second loss 
of the season last week at Penn 
State, a heartbreaking 28-21, the 
ramifications of which will continue 
to ripple. They have little more than 
pride to play for through the rest of 
the season, but this program could 
sure use some pride these days.
The Fighting Irish come to town 
scathed in their own right, with a 
narrow loss at Georgia poking holes 
in the sails of their College Football 
Playoff hopes. They need to win out, 
and they need to do so in impressive 
fashion. Even that will require some 
help from others.
Here are just a few things to 
watch, in a top-20 matchup that 
feels far more like the semifinals of 
a consolation bracket.
Is Michigan up for this?
We’ll know early on whether 
this is a game it truly wants to play 
— if all that talk about moving on 

quickly, refocusing attention and 
rearing up for a night game against 
Notre Dame was substantiated. 
“We have an opportunity — 
we have a decision to make,” said 
senior quarterback Shea Patterson 
on Tuesday, stopping just shy of 
elucidating that decision. “Our goal 
is to win every game the rest of the 
season. I love this team. We’re all so 
close, and we trust each other, and 
we love playing together. I don’t 
think there is any other goal than to 
just win.”
That is an admirable goal, and 
exactly what a senior quarterback 
should say the week after a loss that 
effectively ended his season hopes.
Point all you’d like at Notre 
Dame’s weak schedule or pedestrian 
showing 
against 
Southern 
California two weeks ago. The 
Fighting Irish are ranked 21st in 
SP+, which is slightly more bearish 
than the more traditional rankings. 
But if the Wolverines aren’t 
mentally, emotionally and physically 
invested in these outcomes, none of 
that will matter. We’ll know pretty 
early whether talk is cheap inside 
Schembechler Hall or whether this 
team believes it still has something 
to play for.
If it does, there’s a real argument 

it is the better team on Saturday — 
and should win. If it doesn’t, nothing 
else really matters.
How will the Wolverines start?
In two top-15 matchups this year, 
Michigan has fallen into deficits of 
28-0 and 21-0, both of which proved 
insurmountable. Needless to say, 
another early dud would spell doom 
for a Wolverines team in desperate 
need of a therapeutic win. 
There are endless reasons for 

slow starts, a trend that dates back 
to Michigan’s 21-3 deficit in the first 
half of last year’s season opener at … 
 
Notre Dame. 
The quickest way to sink hopes 
of a season resurgence would be to 
come out flat — squandering any 
perceived energy carried over from 
last week’s promising second half. 
This offense needs to hit the ground 
running, building on the back of 
a lively 21-point second half last 

week. It cannot revert to old ways. 
This defense can’t afford to spot the 
opposing foe multiple touchdowns 
before it finds its footing.
Sometimes, 
football 
is 
complicated. Other times, you just 
can’t afford to hand a top-10 team 
a multiple-touchdown lead before 
either team can catch its breath. 
Most teams aren’t good enough to 
do that. Michigan certainly isn’t.

All starts in the run game
After a boon in attention at the 
start of the year, Zach Charbonnet 
reminded fans that he’s the most 
talented freshman running back 
Michigan has had in quite some 
time. His two touchdowns against 
Penn State marked his fifth and 
sixth of the season — only trailing 

Mike Hart and Tyrone Wheatley 
(each with nine) for the most in 
a rookie campaign. Smart money 
lies on his topping that.
He looked spry against the 
Nittany 
Lions, 
seeming 
fully 
recovered from an injury that 
kept him limited for a few weeks. 
This week seems to be a prime 
opportunity for 20-plus carries, 
coming against a solid — but 

still vulnerable — Fighting Irish 
defense.
The Irish have allowed 100-plus 
yards rushing in each game this 
season except one — including two 
200-plus yard games. On average, 
Notre Dame allows 154 rushing 
yards per game, sitting a middling 
64th in the country.
“Establishing the run” can 
be 
one 
of 
those 
colloquial 

football cliches that ostensibly 
means nothing, but it would be 
surprising if Michigan didn’t 
make a concerted effort to involve 
Charbonnet and the other running 
backs early and often. This is 
particularly true if Patterson’s 
health permits a true read on some 
of those read options.
Turnover margin
Oh, great, another football 
cliche!
But one of the Wolverines’ 
most fatal flaws this year has 
been its propensity to turn the 
ball over at will. They’ve lost nine 
fumbles of 17, and Patterson has 
four interceptions — including a 
maddening misfire on a screen 
pass last week that led directly to 
seven points. 
Notre Dame has the best 
turnover margin per game of any 
team in the country — plus-1.67 
turnovers per game. The easiest 
way to quell a team trying to build 
momentum is to snag an easy 
turnover and pin Michigan in a 
difficult spot, perhaps an early 
deficit. 
If a scenario like that unfolds, 
it could be deja vu for the 
Wolverines, and the clear recipe 
for yet another big-game loss.
The Pick:
Michigan hasn’t lost in the Big 

House in 698 days, which is also 
the last time it wasn’t favored in 
a home game. 
The 
Fighting 
Irish went to 
Georgia 
and 
nearly 
beat 
the 
Bulldogs 
between 
the 
hedges 
earlier 
this season, so 
they 
certainly 
aren’t going to 
be 
frightened 
by 
a 
road 
game 
against 
a 
limping 
Michigan team. 
And 
they’re 
better. 
Maybe 
not 
substantially 
so; maybe Michigan’s offense has 
truly turned a corner; maybe the 
unforced errors and turnovers 
are a thing of the past; maybe the 
focus is there, and the team truly 
has put last week behind it; maybe 
the defense is in for a signature 
performance, shirking the early-
game, big-play struggles.
But that’s a few too many 
hypotheticals for my liking. I’ll 
take the better, more proven 
football team.
