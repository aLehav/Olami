LSA junior Chris Armstrong
snd Business. Srhooi junior
Jason Raymond of MForward
were elected Michigan Student
Assembly president and vice
president last night, according
to unofficial election results dis-
tributed late last night.
Armstrong and Raymond
won by more than 1,000 votes -
beating out the Michigan Vision
Party's Ian Margolis and Tom
Stuckey - in an election with
a student voter turnout of 14
percent, the highest it's been in
years.
Students also voted to pass a
new constitution drafted by Stu-
dents 4 Progressive Governance,
which will alter the structure of
MSA.
Throughout the campaign
MForward promised to estab-
lish a more unified student gov-
ernment where students can see

After hearing the results,
Armstrong's satisfaction could
be heard in a jittery phone inter-

Demonstration at
state Capitol aimed
to show opposition
to state funding cuts
By DEVON THORSBY
Daily StaffReporter
Between 300 and 400 students
from public universities across
Michigan rallied in Lansing yes-
terday to show state representa-
tives and senators their concern

over decreased state funding for
public colleges.
The Student Association of
Michigan, a combination of stu-
dent governments from public
universities in the state, organized
the demonstration in which stu-
dents marched outside the Capitol
building and met with individual
legislators to discuss cuts in state
funding for higher education.
Part of the reason for the rally
was to show opposition to a bill
that passed in the state Senate on
Tuesday that calls for a 3.1 per-
cent cut in funding to public uni-

versities and community colleges.
The bill has now been sent to the
House Appropriations Commit-
tee.
Business School junior Alex
Serwer, a Business School rep-
resentative for MSA, said one
of the major goals of the rally
was to lobby to stop cuts in state
appropriations that are expected
to appear in the upcoming state
budget.
He also said the rally focused
on asking legislators to bring back
the Michigan Promise Scholar-
ship, which was cut from the 2010

fiscal year budget. In her budget
plan last month, Democratic Gov.
Jennifer Granholm proposed a
new version of the scholarship
that gives a $4,000 tax credit to
students who choose to work for
one year in Michigan after gradu-
ation and who go to a state univer-
sity.
LSA sophomore Amanda
Caldwell helped to organize the
University's participation in
the rally by arranging meetings
between students and legislators
in their offices. She said other

While Michigan is still grap-
pling with the worst unemploy-
ment rate in the country, the City
of Ann Arbor has managed to ride
the wave of the recession with a
lower unemployment rate than
the rest of the state, due largely
to the city's focus on a technol-
ogy-based economy rather than
one rooted in the manufacturing
industry.
In January2010, theunemploy-
ment rate in Washtenaw County
was the lowest in the state at 9.3
percent, while the unemployment

gan was 14.3 percent, according to

LSA freshmen Ellie Howe and
Hari Vutukuru have become the
first two students to be elected
to the Department of Public
Safety Oversight Committee in
more than a decade, according
to Michigan Student Assembly
election results published late
Thursday night.
Their election comes after
MSA revamped its election pro-
cedure for student represen-
tatives to the oversight body
following an article in The
Michigan Daily that quoted inde-
pendent lawyers saying that the
assembly's previous election pro-
cess appeared to violate state law.
The two candidates who were
elected - Howe from the Defend
Affirmative Action Party and
Vutukuru from the Michigan
Vision Party - were the only

two in the running. LSA senior
Deandre Hicks, from DAAP, was
originally on the ballot but with-
drew his candidacy Wednesday
morning.
During this year's spring MSA
elections, students at the Uni-
versity could vote for two stu-
dents to serve as representatives
on the DPS Oversight Commit-
tee - a committee with student,
staff and faculty members who
address citizens' grievances con-
cerning the campus police. In
order for the University to have a
campus police force, a Michigan
state statute mandates the Uni-
versity to have an oversight com-
mittee for the campus police.
Since 1999, MSA has appoint-
ed students to serve on the com-
mittee. But independent lawyers
told the Daily last November that
MSA was violating thge statute
because it calls for the student
representatives to be elected to
the committee - not appointed.
After MSA looked into -the
matter, representatives decided
that the assembly was not follow-
ing the statute and that election

Fire simulations
at fraternity and

By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
Members of some fraternities
and sororities on campus have

been getting a bit of a startling
study break recently.
As part of a new initiative to
educate residents of fraternity
and sorority houses at the Uni-
versity, fire safety officials from
the Washtenaw County Chapter
of the American Red Cross and
the Ann Arbor Fire Department
have been visiting the houses
and conducting surprise fire
simulations.
The fire drills and feedback

sessions are part of a recent
collaboration between the Red
Cross, the AAFD and the Univer-
sity's Office of Greek Life to test
Greek houses' ability to evacuate
safely in case of an emergency.
Jim Rampton, community

tor for the Washtenaw County
Chapter of the American Red
Cross, said the initiative was

FOLLOW ALL OF THE ACTION Flint Fire Department battles 5
DURING SATURDAY'S HOCKEY GAME. fires, same day as city layoffs

On Twitter: @michdailysports

As many as 88
firefighters may
be layed off
FLINT, Mich. (AP) - Crews
battled at least five fires in Flint yes-
terday, the same day the city began
laying off a quarter of its firefighters
as part of an effort to close its esti-
mated $8 million budget deficit.
"This was a premeditated attack
on the safety of the community that
is likely to have been timed to try
to achieve some kind of perverted
political purpose," Mayor Dayne
Walling said at a news conference.
The early morning fires broke
out at four vacant homes and an
empty 4-story apartment building,
Battalion Chief Andy Graves said.

They follow four blazes at vacant
homes Wednesday that Graves said
left one firefighter injured when a
ceiling collapsed and another fire-
fighter burned.
"They're all being investigated as
suspicious," Graves said..
Walling has said that barring a
last-minute agreement with unions,
the city expected to lay off 23 of 88
firefighters and 46 of 150 police offi-
cers, nearly a third of the city's police
officers. Talks continued yesterday.
Some Fire Department layoffs
took effect yesterday as firefighters
came off duty, Graves said, while
others were to take effect todeay.
Flint is closing two of its five fire
stations as part of the cost-cutting
effort.
A firefighters union official said
Walling's layoffs were an open invi-

tationto arsonists.
"The mayor painted a pretty
appealing picture for them," said
Mark Kovach, vice president of
Flint Firefighters Union Local 352.
He said the layoffs leave Flint with
half the firefighters it needs to ade-
quately do the job.
The battered industrial city has
been hard-hit by the loss of tens
of thousands of auto industry jobs
over recent decades. Its population
has fallen to about 115,000 from
a peak of about 197,000, leaving
behind crumbling neighborhoods
and vacant homes.
A "person of interest" was spot-
ted at the scene of some of the fires
Thursday and was being ques-
tioned, said Public Safety Director
Alvern Lock. He declined to label
the person a suspect.

0 Mich. Senate passes
stricter texting
while driving ban
The state Senate on Thursday
passed a new, tougher version of
legislation that would make it ille-
gal to send text messages from cell
phones while driving in Michigan.
The main bill in the package
passed the Republican-led chamber
by a 28-10 vote, with only Republi-
cans in opposition. It now advances
to the Democrat-led House, which
isn't expected to take up the new
measure until returning from a
scheduled two-week break that
ends in mid-April.
The new Senate version would
make texting while driving a pri-
mary offense starting July 1, mean-
ing police could pull over and cite
motorists just for texting. Fines
would be $100 for a first offense and
$200 for each offense after that.
Previous versions of the bill had
made texting a secondary offense.
That meant police would need
some other reason to stop a vehicle.
WASHINGTON
Sanctions imposed
on Sunni leader
with suspected ties
to al-Qaida
The Obama administration on
Thursday imposed new sanctions
on a Sunni leader in Iraq believed to
be connected to al-Qaida.
The Treasury Department said it
is freezing the assets in U.S. juris-
dictions of Muthanna Harith al-
Dhari, 40, for allegedly providing
financial and technological support
to al-Qaida in Iraq and providing
guidance for attacks against coali-
tion and Iraqi forces.
At the same time, the United
Nations added al-Dhari, who has
led the Sunni Association of Mus-
lim Scholars, to its list of individu-
als and entities associated with
Osama bin Laden, al-Qaida and the
Taliban.
The U.S. has accused al-Dhari,
who is believed to be living in Jor-
dan, of ordering the kidnappings of
foreigners and directing an October
2006 plot to bring bombs into Bagh-
dad's fortified Green Zone as part
of an effort to assassinate the com-
mander of U.S. forces in Iraq and the
U.S. and British ambassadors.
WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP, N..
Teenager charged
again in Walmart
racial incident
A teenager who allegedly made
an announcement earlier this
month ordering all black people
to leave a southern New Jersey
Walmart has been charged in a
similar incident at the same store
just after Christmas.
The 16-year-old Atlantic County
boy, whose name was not released
because he is a juvenile, was
charged last week with harassment

and bias intimidation in the March
14 incident.
Washington Township police
said Thursday that the teen did the
same thing Dec. 28 at the Glouces-
ter County store. Police were not
initially notified of that incident,
but store officials turned over sur-
veillance video this week.
MEXICO CITY
Drug trafficker
known as 'King of
 Heroin' arrested
Federal police have arrested
Mexico's "King of Heroin," a pow-
erful drug trafficker allegedly
responsible for running thousands
of pounds of heroin into Southern
California each year, authorities
said Thursday.
Jose Antonio Medina, nick-
named "Don Pepe," was arrested
in the western state of Michoacan
on Wednesday and is being held for
prosecution, said Ramon Pequeno,
head of the anti-narcotics division
of Mexico's federal police.
Medina, 36, ran a complex smug-
gling operation that hauled 440
pounds (200 kilograms) of heroin
each month across the Mexican
border in Tijuana for La Familia
drug cartel, Pequeno said.
The White House National Drug
Threat Assessment says that while
heroin use is stable or decreasing in
the U.S., the source of the drug has
shifted in recent years from Colom-
bia - where production and purity
are declining - to Mexico.

tively low unemployment rate can
be attributed to the area's diver-
sification of industries, according
George Fulton, director of the
University's Research Seminar in
Quantitative Economics.
"We are still losing jobs, even if
you are creating jobs," Fulton said.
"If you don't create them rapidly
to cover the people, the unem-
ployment rate will stay up there.
Ann Arbor is doingbetter than the
state because of the mix of indus-
tries, particularly in the city area."
According to the statistics, the
number of jobs in Washtenaw
County declined from 171,900 in
January 2009 to 164,600 in Janu-
ary 2010 alone. In January 2010,
the number of unemployed work-
ers in the county increased from
12,900 to 16,800.
Fulton said that while he, and
many other economists, predict
that the rate of rising unemploy-
ment will decrease in the future,
throughout 2010, it will continue
to be high and have an adverse
affect on people seeking employ-
ment.
The ability of Ann Arbor's
economy to adapt to changing
industries and move away from
the manufacturing sector is a
strong contributor to its capacity
to remain a stable city throughout
the recession, Fulton said.

going to be quite as good as they

fire at the Delta Upsilon fraternity
house. In May 2008, the house,
located at 1331 Hill Street, caught
fire, destroying a large portion of
the structure.
After conducting some
research, Rampton said he con-
cluded that the Greek community
is at "high risk" when it comes to
fire danger.
According to a 2009 Federal
Emergency Agency report on fires
in on- and off-campus housing at
universities, fraternity and soror-
ity house fires account for a small
portion of the total number of
fires that occur at colleges across
the country. However, the report
also found that fires at fraternity
and sorority houses account for a
larger portion of larger fires.
According to the FEMA report,
fraternity and sorority houses
across the country account for
13 percent of non-confined fires,
4 percent of confined fires and 6
percent of all university housing
fires.
Once the Ann Arbor Fire

Department and the Office of
Greek Life decided to team up,
Rampton said officials devised a
plan, which would include frater-
nities and sororities that chose to
participate after being asked by
the Office of Greek Life.
Because the fire simulations
are meant to be as realistic as
possible, most of the people liv-
ing in the house don't know when
they will happen. Only the chap-
ters' presidents are informed of
the dates of the fire simulations,
Rampton said.
When the fire simulation
starts, the house's fire alarm is
pulled. Residents leave the house,
they are greeted by a fire truck
and American Red Cross cars.
Once everyone has exited the
house, the residents are informed
that it is a fire simulation and then
participate in an interactive feed-
back session with members of
both the AAFD and the American
Red Cross.
The purpose of the feedback
session is to explain to the mem-
bers of the house how they could
better improve their evacuation
in the event of a real fire.
The first fire simulation was
conducted in the middle of Feb-
ruary, Rampton said.
LSA junior James Milne, risk
manager for Phi Delta Theta - a
fraternity that participated in a
simulation earlier this month -
said the experience was helpful

overhaul of higher education aid
on its way to President Barack
Obama's desk.
Under the measure, private
banks would no longer get fees
for acting as middlemen in fed-
eral student loans.
The government would use the
savings to boost Pell Grants and
make it easier for some workers
to repay their student loans. In
addition, some borrowers could
see lower interest rates and
higher approval rates on student
have been in the past, but it all
depends on what you are looking
for," Fulton said. "In terms of the
state, Ann Arbor is doing as well
as any place in the state, and it is
probably going to do better in the
future because its economy is tar-
geted more toward the knowledge
information-based economy, (and
moving) more away from manu-
facturing."
But not all Ann Arbor officials
think the state should completely
abandon its manufacturing-based
background.
Ann Arbor City Councilmem-
her Mike Anglin (D-Ward 5) said
he still supports manufacturing
as a central component to Ann
Arbor's success in the changing
economybecause he fears that too
much of an emphasis on technol-
ogy may not be as beneficial in the
long run.
"I would like to see us as a state
concentrate more on manufactur-
ing (than) put all our eggs in one
basket of high tech," Anglin said.
"I think the ultimate thing, as
Ford has shown, is that the manu-
facturing sector will be our larg-
est employer as it has been in the
past and will move that way in the
future."
However, Fulton refuted this
notion, stating that an educated
workforce is the best bet for the
state's economy to recover.
"Anything to do with more
knowledge-based industries are
the ones that are going to be most
successful down the road," Fulton
said.
to the fraternity's members.
He said though they were told
by the Red Cross and the fire
department that the fraternity
did a good job of staying calm and
checking the house to make sure
no one was left inside, there are
still areas they could improve on.
"They wanted us to have a set
place to meet outside and said
that we should get a louder fire
alarm because it wasn't too loud
upstairs," Milne said.
LSA sophomore Tom Hard-
enbergh, president of Phi Delta
Theta, said since the fraternity
had an "informal system" prior to
the fire simulation, the fraternity
took the suggestions to heart and
implemented them at their chap-
ter meeting that same night.
Hardenbergh said though
he doesn't think the members
believed there was an actual fire
going on at the time, members
took it "seriously enough" and
had an "adequate response."
He added that while he thinks
the initiative is a good idea, he
thinks that after a while, the
simulation's intent to surprise
may wear off, since most mem-
bers of the Greek community
will become aware of the initia-

tive.
"The act of it being a surprise
is very important in seeing how
people react," Hardenbergh said.
"If you go to every single house,
eventually people will know it's
going to happen. But the idea
behind it is definitely agreatidea,
especially with the Delta U house
fire in the summer of 2008."
LSA and Kinesiology senior
Jordan Nelson, president of Alpha
Gamma Delta - a sorority on Hill
Street -, said the sorority had the
fire simulation last month, which
helped members to gain a general
knowledge of whatthey should do
in those situations.
"We always have our regular
fire drills, but this was an interac-
tive experience because we were
able to talk to them and they letus
know what we were doing wrong
and what we could improve
upon," Nelson said.
Nelson said one flaw the AAFD
and Red Cross officials pointed
out was thatmany of the residents
exited through the front door of
the house instead of the nearest
door. They also suggested that the
sorority create a method to make
sure the sorority is accountable
for all the residents of the house.
The sorority plans on improv-
ing this in the future by creating a
buddy system, Nelson said.
Since the sorority house has
had many false alarm fire drills

loans.
The legislation, an Obama
domestic priority overshadowed
by his health care victory, has
widespread reach. About 8.5
million students are going to col-
lege with the help of Pell Grants.
The measure was part of a
package of fixes to the health
care legislation Obama signed
earlier this week. The Senate
approved the fixes Thursday,
and the House planned to vote
on them later in the day.
But both Fulton and Anglin
think the University's presence
in the city and its job stability has
played a big role in keeping the
Ann Arbor economy alive and in
drawing people to the city and
surrounding area.
"The presence of the University
creates jobs in this area," Fulton
said. "The University has a posi-
tive economic impact on the area
and on the state."
Anglin attributed Ann Arbor's
low unemployment rate to the
lower-paying jobs like retail that
have been coming to the city, but
said he thought this ultimately
wouldn't help the city recover
from the recession or provide
career opportunities for students.
"I think Ann Arbor was able to
sustain a 9-percent (unemployment
rate), which I think is a good deal
of unemployment," Anglin said.
"Most of the immediate expansion
of jobs has taken place right outside
the city. We might have lost some
tech jobs, but there havebeen some
stores and stuff that have opened
right outside the city."
But Anglin added that the city's
decreasing population is a cause
for concern in terms of trying to
get more resources for the city.
"I think we are losing popula-
tion and that the 2010 census will
reveal that," Anglin said. "We
have limited budget resources but
have to use them wisely and do
things that are much more suited
to our population level. Since the
year 2000, we have lost popula-
tion, about 1 percent."
recently, Nelson said the resi-
dents weren't so surprised by the
fire alarm's going off, though they
still exited the house.
But Nelson said this initial
reaction changed when the mem-
bers saw the fire truck outside.
Nelson added that once the situ-
ation was explained, the sorority
members were eager to hear what
the fire safety officials had to say.
Chris Haughee, assistant
director of Greek Life, said he
feels the initiative has been effec-
tive thus far in increasing fire
safety awareness among students
in the Greek community.
"(They) seem to reflect that
students appreciate the effort and
are learning what they need to do
in response to these situations,"
Haughee said.
Haughee said he thinks
through the Greek community's
involvement in fire safety aware-
ness, others on campus will reap
the benefits as well.
"We hope that the effort of
Greek Life (will) also have a
favorable impact on the rest of
the community," he said. "Our
students are involved in a lot of
student groups and their experi-
ences can be shared with them.

The ripple effect will hopefully
be positive."
Rampton, the community
disaster education coordinator,
said that so far participating stu-
dents' reactions have only "rein-
forced the idea of this initiative."
"It's very obvious that many
sororities and fraternities don't
have plans in place, don't have
plans for accountability and are
unsure on what roles to take,"
Rampton said. "They knew to get
out of the building, but there's
more to it than that."
Rampton said it's important to
have a meeting place all residents
are aware of so that everyone is
accounted for and to know exact-
ly how many people are inside
the premises when the alarm is
pulled.
He added that the University
has one of'the oldest Greek sys-
tems in the country with many
older houses, making them even
more susceptible to fire damage.
The Delta Upsilon house that
caught fire in 2008 was built in
1903.
"Asa result, many (Greek hous-
es) were built in the 1920s, some
even earlier," Rampton said. "A
lot of the wood and insulation are
very, very old. Some of them have
obviously been updated but some
parts of the houses are impossible
to update. With age, the risk (of
fire) is higher."

AARON AUGSBURGER/Daily
Students listen to speakers at a rallyto protest state funding cuts to higher
education in Lansing yesterday.

RALLY
From Page 1
students, who had never lobbied
before, contributed to the enthusi-
astic atmosphere at the rally.
"There was great school spirit,
with everyone in the state coming
together," Caldwell said. "They
were waving their school flags
in the crowd and making a lot of
noise."
LSA senior Fiona Ruddy, who
went to Lansing, said she felt the
speakers at the rally made many
valid points about students who
feel they need to leave the state
after graduating.
"Speakers talked about the fact
that students don't want to leave
Michigan," Ruddy said. "There are
many students who are concerned
about Michigan and grew up here
who really want to stay invested in
the state and don't want to have to
leave."
Ruddy said 10 of the 15 public
universities in Michigan had stu-
dents attend the rally, including
schools located in the Upper Pen-
insula like Northern Michigan
University and Michigan Tech
University.
Caldwell said representation
from multiple schools is necessary
in order to make legislators under-
stand that students don't want
more budget cuts.
"We could all see that maybe
we have rivalries in football, but
we need to come together on this

issue to make something happen,"
Caldwell said.
The students who talked with
legislators distributed a letter com-
piled by the Student Association
of Michigan and College Demo-
crats. The letter included statis-
tics about how much tuition has
increased over the past 15 years
and explained how the govern-
ment's decisions have forced stu-
dents to bear the financial burden
of higher education.
According to Caldwell, the aver-
age amount of student loans is
nearly $25,000. Caldwell added
that students' need for loans
increases with each tuition hike.
Caldwell said the meetings with
members of the state legislature
were frustrating because represen-
tatives tried to defend their reasons
for cutting funds for education.
"(In the offices) we kept hear-
ing that we're in a recession and
the budget is being cut across the
board," Caldwell said. "We know
we need to look at the bigger pic-
ture, but education is the founda-
tion of that picture."
After the rally occurred outside,
students were brought into the gal-
leries for both state representatives
and state senators to see the stu-
dent turnout.
Serwer said standing in the gal-
lery made legislators connect faces
with their budget cutting deci-
sions.
"We showed that students really
care about higher education," Serw-
er said."It wasvery,verysuccessful."

Funds derailed
Commuter train must change track for federal aid
lans for a commuter train from Ann Arbor to Detroit
have been temporarily derailed. The Southeast Michigan
Council of Governments planned to have the line up and
running by October, but the project has been delayed. Though
the project initially received federal funding in a larger grant to
Michigan, monetary difficulties have halted. progress. But there
are more federal funds that could be available, though currently
the project doesn't meet all of the requirements. This commuter
train would be beneficial for both Ann Arbor and Detroit com-
munities. SEMCOG should make sure the project satisfies the
federal requirements so they can get this commuter service back
on track.

Reforming patriotism

The proposed commuter train would run
between Ann Arbor and Detroit, with stops
in Ypsilanti and Dearborn and at Metro
Airport. The train would make four round-
trips a day during the week, and three per
day on the weekends. One-way tickets
would be around $6 and the trip from Ann
Arbor to Detroit would take about an hour.
In December, the U.S. Senate allocated $3.5
million to the project, but SEMCOG says it
needs more money to keep moving forward.
For now, the project has been halted. SEM-
COG hasn't announced a new start date.
The project could qualify for an additional
$100 million from a 2005 federal transpor-
tation earmark if it reworks plans to meet
all of the requirements.
Hopefully, this postponement will be
only temporary, because the commuter line
holds a great deal of promise for Southeast
Michigan. It could lead to some hefty eco-
nomic benefits. Among other things, the rail
line would give commuters between Ann
Arbor and Detroit access to cheap, speedy
transportation and save them money on
parking and gas. This would be significant
considering that, according to Ann Arbor
City Councilmember Carsten Hohnke (D-
Ward 5), between about 60 and 70 thousand
commuters travel to Ann Arbor by car each
year. The rail line would also make it easier
for people to move between Ann Arbor and

nearby cities, opening markets up to new
consumers. Add to this the benefits from
reducing car traffic, pollution and conges-
tion, and the project is obviously a worth-
while investment.
And the train would also be a useful
resource for students. Cheap, hassle-free
travel to Detroit would help kick Detroit-
based outreach and volunteer programs
into high gear. University departments
could expand interactive course offerings
in Detroit and students would be free to
travel to events in the city. And out-of-state
students would have a reliable, inexpen-
sive way to travel to and from the airport
when the Michigan Student Assembly-
sponsored Airbus isn't running.
But money troubles are stalling the
train. Currently, the project isn't eligible
to receive the federal aid because its cost
per rider exceeds federal standards. But
federal funding is the most reliable - and
probably most easily accessible - source of
financial support. SEMCOG should tap into
this resource and find ways to decrease the
cost of a ride to allow it to reapply for fed-
eral cash.
An inexpensive, easy form of transpor-
tation would improve cities' economies
and students' learning experiences. And
SEMCOG must do whatever is necessary to
ensure that the train starts rolling.

The evening of Mar. 21, 2010,
when President Barack
Obama's watershed health
care bill passed,
might mark the
beginning of
a time when I :
no longer feel
ashamed to say
that I am Ameri-
can. I may now
begin to embrace
my citizenship.-
This in some ways BRITTANY
parallels a remark
made by Michelle SMITH
Obama during the
2008 presidential
campaign: "For
the first time... I am proud to be an
American."
Up until now, what I thought it
meant to be an American was not
encouraging to who I am or where I
come from. For me, to be American is
to be oppressive to other "Third World
Nations" for the sake of spreading
nationalism and combating terrorism.
The United States historically hasn't
acknowledged how this country uses
its willpower and massive weapons of
destruction to agitate less resource-
ful nations. To me, for so long, to be
American has meant spreading values
like liberty and justice in undemocrat-
ic nations while failing to extend the
same values at home. More often than
not, to have status as a U.S. citizen has
been associated with demanding apol-
ogies from other nations and for their
savage disciplinarian tactics while
dismissing our own government's acts
that have terrorized human beings -
for instance, those that took place at
the Guantanamo Bay detention center.
Many times, I have felt embar-
rassed by fellow Americans' patrio-
tism. For me, seeing someone wave the

American flag proudly was too bold
a symbol of pride. It was a statement
of arrogance that assumed that every
wave of the flag signified this coun-
try's superiority over the world.
I once heard someone say that there
are two types of people: Those who
stand with other people and those who
stand on top of other people. While I
think the United States is often like
the person that stands on the heads
of other people by asserting its power
over the weak - encouraging immi-
grants to replace their culture with the
"American" culture and using powerto
forcibly assert nationalism in countries
where it is not wanted - all of these
defects of the institutions and social-
ization processes in place in the United
States don't take away from the fact
that Obama is using his presidential
power to reorient the "American" label.
For me, there always stood a bla-
tant paradox about what it meant tobe
"American." The whole ideaof making
it if you try, of pulling yourself up by
your bootstraps, of makinga space for
oneself in the green pastures under
the red, white and blue was confus-
ing when I knew that this image
wasn't one that mirrored the lives of
all people in this country. What about
my grandmother, who in her prime
worked and provided for her family,
but whose health insurance isn't as
comprehensive as it needs to be? Or,
what about the single parent who must
make comprising sacrifices to see that
her child who has asthma is able to
see a physician, given that she doesn't
health coverage? I once speculated
that people of these circumstances
must not be "American."
If what it means to be "American"
is defined within these limited param-
eters, to be American must mean that
people who experience inequalities
must be unequal to what is defined

as the American standard, in which
everyone is thought to be equal. This
could not be truer than when the
media claimed that the victims of
Hurricane Katrina were "refugees,"
as if they were sub-par to the Ameri-
can status and were undeserving to
be labeled as such. How can a coun-
try like ours be a melting pot when it
penalizes people for havingcome from
differing circumstances?.I'm not sure
what title of citizenship people of such
challenges would fall under - perhaps
"disowned." But it certainly wouldn't
be "American."
I may finally
become proud to
be an American.

0

For so long, to be "American" was a
label that for some, including myself,
disassociated itself from identities
that did not fit the often monolithic
standard of what is considered "Amer-
ican." However, with the landmark
health care bill that insures 32 million
of the uninsured, I have more hope
than I did yesterday that perhaps, I
too will one day feel a sense of equality
- when to be American entails inclu-
sion of the "other." A more inclusive
health care system is an important
step toward creating a baseline level
of equality for everyone. Hopefully,
this landmark health care bill will be
considered a patriotic act, and Ameri-
cans will acknowledge that division is
a reality in this country.

Extracurclar growth

According to Wikipedia, a polymath is "a per-
son, with superior intelligence, whose expertise
spans a significant number of different subject
areas." Leonardo da Vinci is undoubtedly the
most well-recognized polymath, and arguably
one of the greatest innovators to ever walk this
earth. He was fearless in his exploration into
every realm of study that intrigued him. His
many titles included painter, sculptor, architect,
musician, scientist, mathematician, engineer,
mentor, anatomist, geologist, botanist and writ-
er. Students should take a hint from Leonardo:
Remarkable things happen when we explore
beyond the limits of our self-imposed boundaries.
The TED event taking place in April at the
University seeks to open people up to this multi-
disciplinary pursuit. "TED" stands for Technol-
ogy, Entertainment, Design - three subject areas
that are shaping our future. The event will show-
case ideas that matter in any discipline.
TED was started in 1984 in southern Califor-
nia. The conference takes place once a year. At it,
the world's leading thinkers and doers are invit-
ed to share what they are most passionate about.
The aim is to offer attendees a chance to discover
new ideas and push the boundaries of their own
intellect. Attendees have called it "the ultimate
brain spa" and "a journey into the future."
In March 2009, TED offered up their name
and format for independent organizers to create
their own "TED-inspired" conferences through
a spinoff organization called TEDx. Since then,
events have taken place in every corner of the
globe: from Paris to Hyberabad, India to Kibera
and Kenya to universities across this country.
In this very short period of time, TEDx has
emerged as a global phenomena, showing that
people everywhere are eager to discover new
ideas and spread inspiration.
There is no question that the University is a
colossal entity. Imagine the faces of 40,000 stu-
dents and 6,000 faculty members - it's mind-
boggling. The sheer number of highly driven and
intelligent individuals in such a small space cre-
ates infinite opportunities to realize new possi-
bilities. Think of the University as a microcosm
of the world. The University prides itself in its
flourishing diversity of ideas. This is why we

have decided to bring TED to the University- to
unleash the collective talent and creativity it has
incubated for so long.
On Apr. 10, TEDxUofM will gather the leading
thinkers, makers, and doers from the University
for a stimulating day of presentations, discus-
sions, entertainment and art that will spark new
ideas and opportunities for all. The audience
will be composed of a diverse, yet curated, mix
of 300 students, professors and thought leaders
from the University and beyond. We see this as
the start of a conversation, a preview of profound
things tocome.
Most conferences give that information about
who is presenting pretty early on. Well, where's
the fun in that? We are inviting you to discover.
To imagine what's in the gift-wrapped box. To
enter the auditorium with the buzz that tells you
something big is about to happen. Because in
return for a bit of risk, we promise to showcase 20
of the most fascinating and engaging minds the
University and Ann Arbor have to offer.
Over 15 different departments at the Univer-
sity will be represented at the event. Just imag-
ine an aerospace engineering student enabling
us to dream beyond our planet, a design pro-
fessor displaying the incredible things you
can do with basic materials, an MBA student
discussing the power of simplicity in solving
the most pertinent issues our world faces and
a Wolverine athlete discussing his brief brush
with fame. Now imagine being there, watching
this unfold and partaking in the various dis-
cussions. Think of all the possibilities that this
idea sharing holds. You do not need to travel far
to find an incredible pool of talent. The Univer-
sity is your TED universe.
In the words of University President Mary
Sue Coleman, "Great universities like Michigan
must transcend disciplines to be truly effective
in addressing societal needs." TEDxUofM is the
answer to this reality. We invite you to explore
beyond your comfort zone. Finda little Leonardo
Da Vinci in yourself. To discover the University at
its best, go to www.tedxuofm.com.

As Ann Arbor thaws with the
coming of spring, most of us
feel some combination of gid-
diness (my face
isn't numb!), anxi-
ety (I still don't
have a summer
internship!) and
terror (I'm even
closer to the home-
less, jobless, fun-
less post-graduate t
reality!)
This year seems LIBBY
to have come and
gone even faster ASHTON
than the last,
prompting an
awareness in me of
the transience of my time at college.
Essentially, I have two years left to
broaden and deepen my understand-
ing of self and the world around me
before I have to go out into the world
and represent myself as a fully devel-
oped person (almost).
Many of us came to the Univer-
sity with the goal of repeating the
academic success we knew in high
school. I've found that to meet my
preconceived standard for academic
excellence, I've had to make big sac-
rifices in other areas of my life. Ambi-
tion and work ethic are exactly the
kind of attributes we hope to develop
here, but neither should blind us from
the importance of life outside our
textbooks. Developing meaningful
interpersonal connections and gain-
ing introspective insight about the
kind of person I should strive to be
is also important. Striking a balance
among these elements is, for me, the
hardest and most important step to
achieving a truly successful college
experience.
When the intimidating newness of
college wears off and we finally start
to feel at home with a set of classes, a
group of friends and a social routine,
it's easy to lose our initial curiosity.

Despite the complacency that com-
fort invites, I need to self-motivate
my exploration.
The posters and chalk advertise-
ments that decorate the Diag and
almost every available wall space are
a testament to the endless supply of
extracurricular educational resourc-
es on campus. I couldn't possibly take
advantage of all of them - but if I
make a habit of ignoring the activity
around me, I'll miss out on the most
accessible pool of potential inspira-
tion I'm likely to ever encounter.
Greek life, the Residential College,
sports teams and other extracurricu-
lar activities provide a community for
their participants but do not have to
dictate a lifestyle of one set of experi-
ences. Actively seeking out the unfa-
miliar should be a habit that extends
beyond freshman year.
Gaining self-knowledge is the most
serious benefit of exposing myself to
the variety of stimulus packed into
this college town. Beyond simply
allowing the flashing lights to pass
before my eyes on my way out of here,
I must internalize the relationships,
the guest lectures, the concerts and
the people watching. I need to allow
the energy of Ann Arbor to resonate
with me in order to gain an under-
standing of the kind of energy I want
to create for myself when I no longer
have it flowing around me, waiting to
be tapped.
We're here to ask ourselves what
kind of people we want to be, what
kind of lives we want to lead and what
kind of impression we want to make
on our communities. The only way
we'll be able to answer those ques-
tions is by engaging our environment
and paying attention to the kind of
reaction we have to that engagement.
For example, my involvement in
a couple of large philanthropy orga-
nizations during my freshman year
revealed my natural discomfort with
fundraising and my preference for

hands-on service projects. About a
month ago, I started working with
826Michigan, a tutoring program
that focuses on creative writing for
6- to 18-year-olds. I consistently
leave their Robot store feeling awe-
inspired.
I want to engage
with Ann Arbor's
unique energy.
But not all ventures end on such
an uplifting note. Two weeks ago, I
left a Groove Spoon show at Elmo's
T-shirt shop on a Stevie Wonder high
that ended with a face-plant on Main
Street. I walked around with a bruise
covering half my face, but it was
worth it because now I know I want
to find funk bands everywhere I go.
Our potential for success - the
kind that guarantees a fulfilling life
- is at its peak and unless we make a
conscious effort to correct our semi-
distorted measures of a successful
college experience, it will pass by
unmet. I hope that as the change of
the seasons breathes life back into
Ann Arbor, I can revitalize the wide
eyes and anxious excitement that I
felt during my first September here.
These are not only supposed to be
the four best years of our lives, but
they can also be the four most trans-
formative years. If we waste them on
daily panic attacks in the stacks and
nightly beer pong tournaments in the
basement, we'll have lost the oppor-
tunity absorb the richness -academ-
ic, cultural and interpersonal - that
surrounds us.

DPS
From Page 1
procedures needed to be revised.
Outgoing MSA President
Abhishek Mahanti co-authored
a proposal to place student can-
didates wanting to serve on
the committee on ballots in the
campus-wide elections that take
place in March and November.
In a Dec. 9, 2009 Daily article,
Mahanti said the majority of the
assembly was in support of the
resolution.
"It's nice that the entire assem-
bly got behind (the issue) to fig-
ure out what can be done to go
forward," Mahanti told the Daily
at the time. "It was a really good
collaborative effort."
Howe and Vutukuru said
before the election results were
published that they were in favor
of the change in election proce-
dures.
"I really believe in the demo-
cratic process and making that
prevalent in respect to student
leadership," Howe said. "I think
when you have a group in power
appointing more and more rep-
resentation it doesn't lead to true
representation and focus on stu-
dents."
She added that elected repre-
sentatives are more productive
and attentive to addressing stu-
dents' concerns than appointed
representatives.
"When you have a group of stu-
dents that directly are asking you
to represent, them and to work
for them, you are much more
accountable to those who elected
you," she said.
In an e-mail interview, Vutu-
kuru expressed a similar opinion
and wrote that he supported the
change to an electoral process.
"I think it's beneficial that the
students understand who exact-
ly is representing them when
it comes to the DPS Oversight
Committee," Vutukuru wrote.
"It allows for more accountabil-
ity and transparency within the
system."
Vutukuru wrote that he
wants to serve on the commit-
tee to improve the relationship
between students and the cam-
pus police.
"Right now I feel as if there's
a mindset that students don't
really appreciate DPS," Vutukuru
wrote. "I feel that when a student
sees a DPS officer they feel like

'OK, here comes another one.' I
want students to feel some admi-
ration for DPS officers, and at the
same time I want DPS officers to
understand students and their
rights."
Howe said she thinks there is
a lack of communication between
DPS and students.
To solve this problem, she said
she wants to hold open forums
where students can talk about
their safety concerns. She also
plans to work with students in
University organizations like
SAPAC and the Spectrum Center.
"I would like to talk to them
a lot about hate crimes they've
heard of and experienced and
try to individualize the approach
that DPS takes towards students
to make it a more efficient and
personal service here," she said.
In an interview on Wednesday,
Hicks said he was not running for
the position and said he was not
aware that his name was still on
the ballot.
Though previously planning
to run, Hicks said he had a "hec-
tic schedule" because he interns
with Congressmen John Dingell
(D-Mich.) 40 hours each week
and attends class.
Hicks said he thought MSA
representatives knew he was not
planning to run anymore.
When Michael Benson, chair
of the MSA Rules and Elections
Committee, was asked about
the matter, Benson said he was
"confused" and didn't know that
Hicks wanted to retract his can-
didacy.
"His name is on the ballot,"
Benson said. "As far as I'm aware,
we never received notice from
him saying he wanted to be taken
off."
In an interview Thursday
night, MSA Election Chair Sagar
Despande said that Hicks offi-
cially withdrew at 9:51 a.m.
Wednesday morning.
Though Hicks is not running,
students could still vote for him
on the ballot. Despande said
Hicks would not take office if he
is elected.
But on Wednesday Hicks said
he would probably accept the
position if elected.
However, he admitted that he
did not know what his responsi-
bilities on the committee would
be or the basic function of the
committee.
"As far of the details, I'm not
quite sure," he said.

SAMANTHA TRAUBEN/Daily
LSA junior Chris Armstrong (center) and Business School junior Jason Raymond (right) celebrate their elections as the next president and vice president of MSA.

ARMSTRONG
From Page 1
compromised as many as 1,000
student ballots, Michael Benson,
chair of MSA's Rules and Elections
Committee, said that the election
ran "relatively smoothly."
Benson said he was happy with
the voter turnout, though he said the
percentage could have been higher.
Student participation in MSA
elections has increased every year
since 2007. In the winter 2008
election, 6.4 percent of the stu-
dent body voted and that number
doubled for the elections in winter
2009 - with 4,497 votes cast.
This year, the tight race between
MForward and the Michigan
Vision Party yielded an even high-
er voter turnout as 5,488 students
cast a ballot.
In the phone interview, Arm-

strong said that he didn't expect
that he and Raymond would win
the majority of the student vote.
"Part of me felt like we were
doing very well, but I never
expected to win," Armstrong said.
"I didn't know how to react until I
actually heard my name."
Armstrong and Raymond will
serve as the new MSA president
and vice president for the remain-
der of the school year and until
March 2011.
Armstrong and Raymond won
by 1,035 votes, though there were
15 grievances filed against MFor-
ward, which resulted in the party
receiving a demerit for one of the
grievances - an unauthorized
campaign sticker was placed above
a urinal in Angell Hall.
Benson said that the number of
grievances filed would make it pos-
sible, yet highly unlikely to threat-
en the newly elected president and

vice president positions. He added
that less than five grievances were
filed in last year's winter elections.
Armstrong and Raymond formed
MForward - a party focused
on direct advocacy and student
involvement - during this year's
election cycle because they believed
some members of MSA didn't think
MSA was solving enough issues or
making University students unite
inside and outside the assembly.
The MForward party platform
includes lobbying for Saturday
night dining in the residence halls,
a gender-neutral housing option
for students and the lobbying for
the passage of the Good Samaritan
Law - a law intended to safeguard
against an intoxicated student
getting a Minor in Possession for
calling an ambulance for another
intoxicated student.
The Michigan Vision Party's
platform promoted tangibility -

or small events that improve stu-
dents' experience at the University.
The Students 4 Progressive Gov-
ernance new student constitution
also passed last night with 2,356
votes in favor of the measure. Since
the document was passed, the
structure of MSA will be revised
accordingly in the coming weeks.
Current MSA Vice President
Michael Rorro, chair of S4PG, told
the Daily earlier this month that
the new constitution will allow
students to have "greater access"
to how their $7.19 student govern-
ment fee is being spent.
The new structure includes the
creation of the University Council
- a body of MSA representatives
who can call for a vote on a drafted
resolution for their constituents.
The resolutions that are approved
by the University Council will
appear before MSA during the
assembly's weekly meetings.

AN A2 FILM FESTIVAL WEEKEND

A tribute
By KAVI SHEKHARPANDEY
Daily Film Editor
In a rare public appearance, legendary
avant-garde filmmaker Kenneth Anger
will be in Ann Arbor Saturday night for a
tribute to his work,
capping off the 48th An Evening with
annual Ann Arbor
Film Festival. Kenneth Anger
The event, fund- Tomorrow at
ed through a grant 7:30 p.m.
given to the festi-
val by the Academy Michigan Theater
of Motion Picture Tickets from $7
Arts & Sciences, will
begin with a selection of Anger's short
films - "Fireworks" (1947), "Rabbit's
Moon" (1963) and two of his most famous
works in "Scorpio Rising" (1963) and
"Kustom Kar Kommandos" (1968). After
the film showcase, Anger will be present
for a conversation with New York film
critic Dennis Lim and a Q&A with the
audience.
To put the significance of this appear-
ance into context, Kenneth Anger at an
avant-garde film festival is like George
Lucas making an appearance at a "Star
Wars" convention. Local academics and
experimental film enthusiasts are prob-
ably as giddy as "Star Wars" fanboys were
as they waited to see "The Phantom Men-
ace" for the first time.
Anger's career began in the 1940s, first
gaining notice for his short film "Fire-
works."
"('Fireworks') is a remarkable iteration
of the so-called 'trance films' of avant-
garde filmmaking practices, which often
focus on a dreaming figure," said Christo-
pher Hanson, a visiting lecturer in Screen
Arts and Cultures. "Even for such an early
film, 'Fireworks' demonstrated a remark-
able mastery of film language."
"Anger's cinematic vocabulary contin-
ued to develop technically and lyrically
throughout his career, with 'Scorpio Ris-
ing' becoming one of his most famous
films and a sensation on the underground
film circuit and a beautiful document of
the counterculture of the '60s," Hanson
added.
"Scorpio Rising" was an important
step in American counterculture, utiliz-
ing a popular soundtrack and exploring

to Anger
the biker subculture years before "Easy
Rider" (1969) did the same and began the
New Hollywood movement.
While Anger was undoubtedly signifi-
cant in the '60s and '70s, he has continues
making films to this day, and his films are
studied extensively in classrooms across
the country.
"(Anger) operates in a unique space
in the U.S., as both his films and written
work directly engage with the relation-
ship between Hollywood and avant-garde
filmmaking practices," Hanson said.
This bridge between Hollywood and
experimental films has also been proven
by Kenneth Anger's strong influence on
several notable contemporary Hollywood
directors, including Gus Van Sant, Martin
Scorcese and David Lynch. In one such
illustration, "Scorpio Rising" features a
montage of a bikers putting on their biker
clothes - black tank top, leather jacket
and aviators - hauntingly set to Bobby
Vinton's song "Blue Velvet," a juxtaposi-
tion Lynch would later emulate in his 1986
film "Blue Velvet."
While Anger's films would certainly be
interesting to watch under the influence
of hallucinogenic drugs - see his 1954
film "Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome"
in particular - they all have deep, under-
lying themes, especially that of homo-
eroticism.
Giving credit to a
true film legend.
"To me, Anger's work is particularly
lyrical in his explorations of sexuality and
identity," Hanson said. "His films often
unveil subcultures within the countercul-
ture in a brilliantly layered and composi-
tionally complex visual fashion, while at
the same time are equally rich with sym-
bolic and poetic beauty."
In the world of avant-garde film, Ken-
neth Anger is a rock star. He's the highly
anticipated highlight for the remainder of
the Ann Arbor Film Festival and will be
present for you to gaze upon his legacy,
whether you worship his work or just
want to experience the craft of a genius.

Wisdom from Tommy Wiseau

Director of infamous cult
classic 'The Room' shares
his creative vision
By DAVID WATNICK
Daily Arts Writer
Though many a laugh has rolled at his
expense, Tommy Wiseau is a resilient man.
Consider: His
notoriety stems TommyWiseafs
entirely from his
life's work, 2003's 'The Room'
"The Room," an Tonight and
incoherent melo- tomorrow at
drama which he midnight
wrote and directed
straight into the State Theater
running for the Tickets $6
worst film of all
time. As if that strange form of infamy isn't
bad enough, Wiseau has even more diffi-
culty expressing himself in person than he
does on screen. Still, he remains unflinch-
ingly committed to filmmaking, art and the
betterment of humanity.
In anticipation of this weekend's mid-
night screenings of "The Room" for the
Ann Arbor Film Festival, the Daily had the
rare pleasure of talking with Wiseau. In the
end, it was difficult to say which was more
salient: his passion or his eccentricity.
"'The Room' was designed by me for
American people - to enjoy it," Wiseau
explained emphatically as he raced through
the back story of his film's mysterious con-
ception.
He took the road less traveled, but with
the final product - a disjointed, dysfunc-
tional, junkpile with sub-soap opera acting
- Wiseau got his wish. Priding himself as
an auteur, though, he of course doesn't see
it that way.
"It was not just an accident. It was not a
coincidence. I don't believe in that kind of
stuff - I believe in creativity," he sermon-
ized, simultaneously admitting his aware-
ness of prevailing perceptions of the film
and attempting to dispel such damning
notions.
Embracing the popularity of "The Room"
among midnight audiences, Wiseau sports
an admirable pride in his work and his mis-
sion. In the process, though, he blurs the

Tommy Wiseau (right) has met almost everyone in Hollywood.

line between loveable loser and delusional
egomaniac. After all, he fired cast and crew
members en masse multiple times during
the course of production.
"How dare these people strike against
'The Room' during production?," Wiseau
wondered out loud. His tone was far
less innocent than it had been when he
explained the source of his creative convic-
tion just moments before, saying, "That's
where art comes from - to create a better
society for people."
Between these comprehensible (if trite)
inspirational quips about the power of arts
in society, Wiseau had a tendency to spew
adorable non sequiturs in ample doses.
"It's not 'A Room,' it's 'The Room!,' " he
insisted at one point, a healthy defiance
audible in his accented voice.
"For your information, I've met every-
body in Hollywood - almost," he revealed
as he prepared to address his decision to
include nudity in "The Room."
As the conversation endured through his
eternal soliloquies, Wiseau became more
and more eager to discuss the ever-present
symbolism with which he adorned "The
Room."
"What does a red dress represent?,"
Wiseau questioned. "Well, it represents
blood. What does blood represent? Survival,
life, eternity for human beings."
That was his justification for the seem-

ingly inconsequential red dress costume
worn by female lead Lisa (Juliette Danielle).
It was but the first of many wildly unpre-
dictable claims.
"The plastic is chemical! The chemical
is very bad for human beings," he warned,
alluding to the conspicuous presence of
framed pictures of plastic spoons which dot
the titular set of "The Room."
"I'm not against a plastic spoon! Con-
trary, I love it! Because, you see, that's a part
of our survival here in America.
And with that, Wiseau again hinted at
what seems tobe the unifying aspiration in
all his efforts: to positively impact America.
He may seem naive and delusional, butas he
forges on with his craft in the face of criti-
cism, mockery, and straight-up bashing, it's
hard not to root for him. His technique may
be wholly unformed, but the idea of stifling
his abundant creative energy seems plainly
criminal.
Luckily for Wiseau and his fans, the fluke
success of "The Room" only fuels his ambi-
tions.
"It will affect everyone in America,"
he guarantees of his next feature proj-
ect, which he hopes to complete within
six months. For now, though, he remains
famous for "The Room," and deservedly so.
"You can talk about 'The Room' with fans
for the rest of your life," Wiseau promised.
"And guess what - you'll still be talking."

"(My art) is some trans-cultural

cites diverse sources Terence McK-

Tonight marks the world premier of
Strangeloop's "avant-garde sci-fi epic"
called "2010: (or) How I Learned to

the work of filmmaker Stanley Kubrick.

film "Heaven & Earth Michigan Theater
Magic," led an incredibly Ticketsfrom 7$
.eclectic lifestyle until his
death in 1991, compiling the Anthology ofAmeri-
can Folk Music in 1952, creating his own set of
tarot cards and directing a number of experi-
mental films.
"Heaven & Earth Magic" is certainly a mark-
er of Smith's bohemian existence. The film is 66
minutes of cutout animation, consisting of the
extended, dreamlike interplay between vari-
ous recurring objects against a black backdrop.
With heavy Surrealist and Dada influences, the
film is lucid but utterly random. One sequence
features a glorified stick figure pulling a water-
melon out of a sarcophagus and placing it on a
postcard depicting more watermelons, while a
cat sits and watches.
"Heaven & Earth Magic" strikes an uncanny
balance between childlike naivety and ghastly
morbidity, conflating images of death and bru-
tality in a winkingly cartoonish manner. At one
point, an aristocratic-looking lady is smashed
multiple times by a child with a hammer, chang-
ing shape with each blow until she becomes a
writhing crane-like appendage on a dentist's

chair and is injected with a mammoth syringe.
And skeletons crop up all over the place as the
film's creatures move freely between states of
life and death. Anything can morph into any-
thing else at any point and laws of physics need
not apply.
Smith was of the mindset that his films should
be set to contemporary music and, consequently,
his animations have often been accompanied by
live scores (Philip Glass and DJ Spooky have
both lent their music to his films).
Tonight, electronics prodigy Flying Lotus
will be premiering his live musical score for
"Magic," and it should be an earful. Known pri-
marily - but rather anonymously - for having
composed the promo music for Cartoon Net-
work's "Adult Swim," the great nephew of the
late Alice Coltrane has released two equally
stellar studio albums (1983 and Los Angeles),
and is dropping a third, Cosmogramma featur-

beats are spacey without being ambient, hitting
hard but scraping along skittishly as if they're
on the constant verge of falling apart. And if his
penchant for brain-melting noises is manifested
at all tonight, then there's no doubt the exhibi-
tion will be a hallucinatory assault on the senses.

TLC's 'Hoarding' can't tie up loose ends

By LINDSAY HURD
DailyArts Writer
Most people have a favorite item they
just can't part with, whether it's a child-
hood teddy bear or
a favorite shirt. But
"Hoarding: Buried Alive"
exposes people who Hoardt
exceed the sentimental
limits and have literally Buried Alive
filled their houses with Sundays at
endless amounts of junk 10p ..
they just cannot give up.
The TLC reality show TLC
takes a dull peek into the
lives of people who never throw anything
away. In the series premiere, "Hoarding"
follows single man Chris, a Navy veteran

and active member of his church who
seems to have it all; and Laurie, a grand-
mother who has filled up her large cot-
tage with crap. Both are aware the habit
is crazy and is affecting their families,
happiness, health and overall well-being.
This obsession with hoarding is a clinical-
ly recognized condition, and while TLC's
series tries to genuinely help people suf-
fering from it, there's no resolution shown
for these real people's problems.
At the beginning of the premiere, Chris
could hardly open his front door and had
to crawl over his junk to get to anywhere
in his house. He hadn't used his kitchen
in at least three years and hid his problem
from his family, friends and girlfriend.
Laurie started collecting stuff to donate
to people in need. Only instead of giving

away her things, she has kept everythingto
make herself feel more secure. Her addic-
tion had gotten so bad that her daughter
wouldn't bring her children over.
The clean-up team
never even cleans
anything up.
Both contact a psychologist and a pro-
fessional organizer to i help sort their
stuff and get to the bottom of their addic-
tions. At the end of six weeks, Chris made
enough progress to walk into his kitchen

and Laurie could throw a dinner party.
Overall, "Hoarding" draws out these
people's problems and bores us to death as
nothing happens. There's just an endless
amount of junk everywhere that never gets
totally cleaned up. Different from other
shows about hoarders, this team of experts
never actually helps to solve the issue.
The only entertaining moments are those
revealing how much crap people can actu-
ally keep collecting. To see mounds and
mounds of stuff piled on top of each other
is slightly fascinating, but in a grossed-out
kind of way that makes you want to throw
out everything you don't need.
While the show does reveal why both
hoarders have developed the habit, it
never does a follow-up with Chris and
Laurie at the end of the hour. It fails to

deliver the crucial moment where we see
whether the hoarders broke their habit.
Unlike other reality shows, you never feel
connected or excited for the person who
finally conquers these fears. For all we
know, Laurie's clean dining room could be
back to resembling a storage bin and Chris
could have bought even more clothes to
store in his house.
There is no resolution and that sucks.
These people have secret lives that affect
the way they live, but there is nothing that
experts on a TV show can fix. Not only
does TLC waste our time, but they pretty
much wasted the hoarders' time. "Hoard-
ers" basically disgraces and embarrasses
its cast and then peaces out, serving only
as a reminder that you need to throw out
your junk and clean your house.

Vital systems fail in 'Repo'

One'Minute' of fame

A cool concept gets foiled
by implausible plot devices
and unfocused aims
By TIMOTHY RABB
Daily Arts Writer
When watching a God-awful movie, at
least a fraction of enjoyment can be had by
wondering about the ori-
gin of such filth. Worse ,**
than a God-awful movie,
however, is one with an Repo Men
excellent original concept
that falls by the wayside. At Quality16
Introducing "Repo Men," a and Showcase
cross between the beauti- Universal
ful, advert-filled cityscapes
of the critically acclaimed
"Blade Runner" and the manure-ridden stor-
ylines of other shoddy future-films in the vein
of "Gamer" and "Death Race."
In the not-so-distant future, the state of
American health care has reached abys-
mal depths. So essentially, it's just plain old
America with a few extra bells and whistles
and looming, mammoth skyscrapers in the
distance. Modern medicine has triumphed
in ways never before conceived, and a large
corporation referred to as "The Union" tai-
lors artificial organs for terminal patients to
the cacophonous tune of around $615,000.
Such extortion necessitates the employ-
ment of "repo men," mercenaries who are
required to repossess an organ if the patient
neglects payment - and by repossess, they
mean to rend the organ from the patient's
insides.
Remy (Jude Law, "The Imaginarium of Dr.
Parnassus") is one such employee, and he and
his partner Jake (Forest Whitaker, "Street
Kings") revel in their duties. They playfully
joke and make a game of their gruesome

occupation. But the audience is eventually
expected to believe Remy's sudden change of
heart when an accident renders him in need
of The Union's services, as well as support
this sketchy anti-hero's altruistic new objec-
tive - how quaint.
"Repo" fails by trying to be too many
things at once - a critique of corrupt politics
and corporatism, a profound buddy movie
and a harrowing moral dilemma. And it just
doesn't work alongside a soundtrack typical
of a Jason Statham movie; the music seems
like it's egging on the Union workers and
conventionalizing their actions rather than
deploring their corruption. The only movie
for which such a strategy can work is one in
which we agree whole-heartedly with the
actions of the protagonist and root for his
cause from start to finish; such an element is
nonexistent in "Repo." The moral compass-
es of Remy and his wife as well as Jake are
apparently stuck somewhere in the Bermuda

Triangle, because your emotions will inevita-
bly vacillate between a minute bit of empathy
and a good deal more of disgust.
Let's not forget Whitaker. He's been a
hit-or-miss actor after his acclaimed per-
formance in "Last King of Scotland," and
it would be nice to say this movie was any-
thing but a poorly calculated shot on his
part. His constant blinking and melodrama
- which might make him convincing in
another role - become an annoyance as the
film progresses.
"Repo Men" gets kudos for a rock-solid
concept, but a concept's execution is the key
to its fruition, and it's impossible to accept
that Remy's jocund approach to his work
could be suddenly reversed by a ridiculous
twist of fate. More work could have made the
characters more believable, and a movie with
such enormous potential that isn't willing to
demand more depth from its characters is a
crying shame for all its waste.

to Win It" sets the stage for a television

a booming narration

them warriors. Some Win It

eration of athletes" NBC
- it feels more like an
Olympic event than a
game show. Unfortunately, the inspira-
tion of this opening theme of NBC's lat-
est game show doesn't carry through to
the rest of the show and is ultimately a
setup for disappointment.
The idea behind the show is just as
awesome as its Olympian theme song.
Contestants must complete 10 harder-
than-they-appear tasks that make use
of various household items. Dozens of
challenges are posted online, people
practice and perfect their execution,
send in an audition tape and NBC flies
them out to the showto perform them
in front of a studio audience for the
prize of $1 million. These challenges
include emptying a Kleenex box with
one hand, stacking five apples on top
of each other, bouncing ping pong
balls off three plates into a bowl and
everything in between, each in only a
minute's time. So far, so good, right?
But the sloppy execution of "Minute
to Win It" dilutes everything great
about it.
Its first real problem is that some-
one thought Guy Fieri would make a
great host. This is the first time the
Food Network star and self-proclaimed
"kulinary gangsta" is tackling a show
that doesn't involve food (save for the
occasional apple stacking). He's pretty
annoying on Food Network, but there
he at least knows what he's talking

tants is a precious commodity and Fieri
doesn't yet have it. Maybe in time, he'll
grow into his own and become a Howie
Mandel or Ben Bailey, but for now Fieri
is just plain awkward.
This is probably magnified by the
unfortunate realization that "Min-
ute to Win It" is unnecessarily long.
While the tasks only take one minute
to complete and contestants will only
complete ten tasks at most (and that's
highly unlikely), there are only ten
minutes of actual action. The rest ofthe
hour is filled with Fieri failing atengag-
ing the competitors in casual conversa-
tion, resulting in little substance and
lots of bore.
Luckily, the contestants them-
selves are hilarious and mostly make
up for Fieri's lack of spark. Big Steve
and Rachy-poo (are cute nicknames a
requirement for this show?) were remi-
niscent of "The Price is Right" contes-

featuring Bob Barker's face. The show
includes segments of their audition
videos, so we're treated to a gratify-
ing glimpse of their intensive practice
regimens consisting of them scooting
around their backyards on a towel.
With "Deal or No Deal," it almost
seems like the contemporary prime-
time game show is back. And though
"Minute to Win It" has its flaws, it
wouldn't take much for theshowto rise
up to that level of national acclaim and
success. Cut it down to a half hour or
get a new host, or both, and the show
will live up to its title sequence. But
unless that happens, "Minute to Win
It" is goingto have to earn an epic repu-
tation before it boasts one.

drastic departure from "Mod-
ern Leper," the delicious first
sip of Rabbit's prior album.
In "Things," lead singer Scott
Hutchinson's signature accent
drawls over a drone of reverb-
heavy electric guitars layered
above feedback and a relent-
less bass-heavy drumbeat. The
entire song builds in promise
of a crescendo, as Hutchin-
son's urgent songwriting style
becomes more evident, yet the
song never fully reaches any
sort of release, instead winding
down just as you are expecting it
to take off.
Refusing to be pinned down,
Frightened Rabbit then treats
the listener to the delightful and
sunny "Swim Until You Can't
See Land." Easily likeable, one
can see why it's the chosen sin-
gle of the album. A cheery fin-
ger-picked guitar leads off the
track, followed by Hutchinson's
urgings to do exactly as the title
suggests while the band backs
him up with perfectly pitched
harmonies. Unlike "Things,"
"Swim" really does take off
in the final minute, delivering
satisfaction in the climax with
horns, well-placed strings and
some rowdy handclaps.
Mixed Drinks certainly ven-

tures in a different direction (if
not an exciting or significant
one) for the Scottish folk aficio-
nados. It appears the band final-
ly caved, adding bass to its music
and another guitar player for an
extra set of hands to help fabri-
cate its thickly layered record.
The production, which is con-
siderably slicker than before,
remains centered on Hutchin-
son's distinct and at times over-
wrought vocals. Mixed Drinks's
charm works when the band
focuses on harmonies, jaunty
melodies and sing-a-long repris-
es, but loses its potential edge on
directionless songs like "Foot
Shooter" that get lost in the
swell of production.
Too far out of
the rabbit hole.
You can't blame a band for
trying to evolve its sound -
Frightened Rabbit's progression
is natural and even commend-
able. With Mixed Drinks, it just
happened to lay it on a little
thick. Even so, the band's obvi-
ous knack for lyrical melody
seeps through the Phil Spector-
like drama on standouts like
"Living in Color," but would be
more effective if they toned it
down a notch. The figurative
rabbit simply needs to retreat
into its hole a little further, and
all will be well.

A bl bloopy drug-addled ambiance

Even before this month's release of the self-
titled album by collaborative project Broken
Bells, the world knew that
James Mercer and Brian
Burton are anything but
normal. Broken Bells
Mercer, the sweet tenor
at the helm of The Shins, Broken Bells
is prone to spewing image- Columbia
rich non-sequiturs all over
any song he writes. The
Shins's 2007 single "Phantom Limb" tells a
story of two lesbians in high school, but from
hearingthe lyrics nobody could have guessed.
Burton, better known as Danger Mouse,
has a penchant for mixing up funky beats
and strange sounds. Masterminding Gnarls
Barkley's ubiquitous 2006 single "Crazy," he
somehow managed to make uber-falsetto
crooning into a cool and catchy hit for every
social circle.
So it's no surprise that, though it certainly
has mass appeal, Broken Bells should sound
a bit "out there." Opening track "The High
Road" floats Mercer's typically cryptic lyrics
over swirling, mutating electronic beeps. The
finished product sounds like the drugged-out
ramblings of a highway wanderer and fades
out with the oddly comforting refrain that

"It's too late to change your mind / You let
laws be your guide."
"Mongrel Heart" brings the weird,
unearthly fun of Broken Bells to its climax.
After opening with a pulsing multi-textured
groove, the track picks up when Mercer
comes in, his lines separated by whooshing
wind sounds and an eerie chorus of "oohs"
and "ahs." The momentum comes to a head
at the two-minute mark, when an expansive
instrumental interlude crashes in, headed
by a trumpet melody straight from southern
Spain.
Several of the songs on Broken Bells reveal
one of the newly minted group's strongest
suits: its preference for unusual instruments.
One section of "Mongrel Heart" uses patterns
of white noise as a rhythmic base. Sporadic
laser bursts add an extraterrestrial feel to the
Mixing The Shins
with Danger Mouse.
otherwise beach-pop psychedelia of "Your
Head Is On Fire." Meandering, trippy "Sailing
To Nowhere" might be one of the first pieces
of popular music to use a Native American
rainstick as an instrument - it could even be

real rain, actually.
Broken Bells does have its share of Shins-
style low-fi guitar and simple synthesized
grooves. Behind Mercer's heavy-echo vocals,
"Citizen" is mainly backed by a straightfor-
ward two-measure piano melody.
But it's difficult to trace the origins of many
of the sounds on Broken Bells. The "how'd
they do that?" aesthetic is something all elec-
tronic music should strive toward - anything
is possible in a genre unbounded by the limi-
tations of physical instruments. Broken Bells
know how to take advantage of their medium,
and the result is refreshing.
.Though much of Broken Bells is stoner
dreaming, ultimately it works. Mercer's warm
voice and simply patterned melodies keep the
tracks from feeling aloof or lonely. There's
plenty of experimentation, but each track is
clearly structured and nothing seems extra-
neous. Every stray blip or bloop on Broken
Bells adds to its ambling, drug-addled ambi-
ance. With the Broken Bells moniker, Mercer
and Danger Mouse have found that rare mix
of "directed" and "drifting" that makes elec-
tronic music really flow.
With The Shins on hiatus and Danger
Mouse as independent as ever, it looks like
Broken Bells gould be around for a while, lyri-
cal and compositional abnormalities and all.
But, really, who needs normality when you've
got these two around?

real students at the Michigan Union
University. And their Free
tales will all be told
onstage this weekend in the student-
produced play "What's Your Story?"
Friends and collaborators Mitch
Crispell and Robbie Dembo, both LSA
juniors, stumbled on the conceptbehind
"What's Your Story?" after a dinner at
Noodles & Co. on State Street last fall.
"Robbie just kept saying, 'I want to
put on a play, I want to put on a play,' "
Crispell said, "And I was like, 'Shut up
Robbie, you can't put on a play!' ... (But)
then I started thinking about it."
Outside Noodles, Crispell and
Dembo saw a man with a sign ask-
ing passersby to share their stories.
Inspiration hit: They would create and
produce their own play, using stories
written and performed by fellow stu-
dents.
"Everyone has a story, and we're
just telling some of them," Crispell
explained.
"What's Your Story?" is composed of
distinct scenes of anonymously submit-
ted monologues held together by a sto-
ry-gathering character, B.D. written by
Crispell and Dembo, who observes and
sometimes comments on the action.
"We're trying to inspire empathy,
show interconnectedness and really
inspire people to share and to listen,"
said Patricia White, an LSA junior
heading the group of student directors
working on the show.
"People from different religions,
different sexualities, different -back-
grounds, race and ethnicities" shared a
variety of personal experiences, White
added.
Fifteen actors will lend their voices
and bodies to the stories.
"I really have learned the impor-
tance of taking the time to listen to
other people and what they have to
say," said actor Olivia Horn, an LSA

freshman. Horn will retell two stories
- one of her own and one by an anony-
mous author.
"It was definitely a lot easier for me
to get into character (when) I knew it
was my story," Horn said. "(The anony-
mous piece) was a lot harder because it
wasn't something that I had personally
been through, soI had to really reflect
on it and put myself in that person's
shoes, moment by moment."
LSA senior Joel Arnold agreed that
empathy is key in the transmission.
"(We're) going into the show with a
mindset that we want to take all that
perspective that we gained and give it
to other people," he said.
Arnold will portray a student taking a
deeper look at his faith after being diag-
nosed with a chronic pain condition.
"Hisbig question is, 'Why would this
God that I've heard about, the compas-
sionate, benevolent God, let this hap-
pen to me?"' Arnold said.
Another scene, which White dubbed
"Frat Boys," combines two stories.
"One is this guy who is quite a beer
pong champion, and he's talking about
A play inspired by
a guy with a sign.
how proud he is as a freshman to be
invited by the seniors in his frat to play
beer pong ... and one guy has never had
a drink and is really proud of that,"
she said. "We all have that stereotypi-
cal frat boy in our mind, but (the scene
shows) two really different aspects of
that."
The flow of the storyline links all
these disparate stories together, expos-
ing feelings and experiences to which
and audience can relate.
"When the lights go up at the end,
you will have just seen accounts of
emotion... across the spectrum of what
people can feel," Crispell said. "You
will have heard about rape, you will
have heard about racism, you will have
heard about joy and sorrow and rela-
tionships and what friendship can do
for someone and what hate can do ...
and hopefully you'll feel this incredible
desire and passion to ask from someone
else their story."

expanded on Caporusso's asser-
tion, saying that it all boils down

time and time again that his team
needs to get those dirty goals,
scramble for rebounds, throw
traffic in front of Bakala and, ulti-
mately, make its scoring chances
count.
But while the Wolverines have
had their fair share of offensive
success in the six-game play-
off stretch thus far - scoring
28 goals in six games - extra
emphasis has been put on the
defensive front through the sec-
ond half of the season.
"We have to stay focused on
the things we have been doing
well," sophomore forward Luke
Glendening said. "The positive
team talk, playing hard defense,
that's important and that's what
our momentum comes from."
Additionally, Michigan has
successfully been able to roll
three lines, and sometimes four,
throughout the playoff run. That
quality could be a difference-
maker against the Beavers, who
trail the Wolverines when it
comes to overall talent and skill.
"They've got a line with 50
goals on it," Berenson said. "We
don't have anything like that. I
think all of our lines are going
to have to be rock solid against
their team. They come at you
hard with four lines, and you'll
see pressure we haven't seen this
year."

Midway through the second
half of yesterday's WNIT third-
round
match- NORTHWESTERN 44
up, MICHIGAN 65
North-
western made a quick 8-0 run
to cut the Michigan lead to 11.
But any hopes the Wildcats had
about mounting a comeback were
soon stifled.
With eight minutes to go in
the game, freshman guard Jenny
Ryan got a steal on the left block
while sophomore forward Car-
men Reynolds nailed a 3 pointer
on the other end of the court,
catapulting the Wolverines on a
10-0 run of their own and effec-
tively sealing the 65-44 Michigan
victory.
The win was the team's second
overhNorthwestern in four match-
ups this season and advanced the
Wolverines to the elite eight of
the Women's National Invitation
Tournament (WNIT).
Defense was certainly the
name of the game for Michigan,
as it held the Wildcats to their
second-lowest scoring output of
the season.
"Our defense did a great job,"
Michigan coach Kevin Borseth
said after the game. "We played
with a lot of energy and we need-
ed to, they're a very good basket-
ball team. ... We came out very
strong, got out to an early lead
and just kind of built on that."
Ryan was a big part of that
defensive mindset.
In the Wolverines' last game
against Northwestern, the Sagi-
naw native demonstrated her
shooting touch by tying a career
high of 12 points.
Last night, Ryan had six steals
and recorded the team's only
block on a Northwestern 3-point
attempt.
"She deflects a lot of passes,"
Borseth said. "Every time the ball
is there, she gets a hand on quite
a few passes, deflects them, steals
them, gets some jump balls.
"She does a lot of the intan-
gibles that don't show up some-
times on the score sheet."
But Ryan wasn't the only play-
er to make an impact defensively.
CAN'T WATCH
THE HOCKEY
GAME?

Junior Veronica Hicks drives the ball down the court in Michigan's third round
WNIT win over Northwestern yesterday. The Wolverines play again on Sunday.

Senior center Krista Phillips kept
Northwestern center Amy Jae-
schke, who had dominated Mich-
igan in the first three matchups,
to just four points in the first half
and a quiet 12 overall.
"She is such a good scorer
around that basket, she just
requires so much attention,"
Borseth said. "I thought we did
a good job of really having active'
legs and getting to her and out in
her."
Phillips did it on the offensive
end as well with a game-high 17
points. It was the second game
in a row in which the offense
went down low, through Phillips,
which opened up things for her
teammates on the perimeter.
Three other players scored in
double figures. Reynolds scored
13 while freshman guard Dayee-
sha Hollins contributed 14 points
and junior guard Veronica Hicks
had 11.
"Any time (Phillips) does well,

obviously, around the basket
it helps us," Borseth said. "She
has that presence about her you
know. The key is to take good
shots. I think the ones she took
today were down inside that lane
attacking the basket as opposed
to standing outside flinging it at
the basket."
The game was eerily simi-
lar to the Wolverines' last game
against Northwestern in the Big
Ten Tournament. In that game,
Michigan jumped out to a big lead
early and went into halftime with
a 22-point lead. Yesterday, the
Wolverines went into halftime up
35-18.
The Wildcats didn't pose a
serious threat in the second
half of either game, and Michi-
gan looks to carry that momen-
tum into Sunday's matchup in
Ann Arbor against the winner
of tomorrow's WNIT matchup
between Virginia Common-
wealth and Syracuse.

In final match before the
Big Ten Tournament, Jung
returns in loss to Stanford

By EVAN KARPUS
For theDaily
Forty-second-ranked junior
Jason Jung, back in action after a
week off due to playing time lim-
its, came into the Michigan men's
tennis singles matchup down 2-0
before making it a 6-3, 6-3 rout.
"I played through a couple
tough games where I was down
early. I tried to not think so much
about the score and just play my
game," Jung said.
Despite Jung's return win,
the Wolverines couldn't muster
enough to beat No. 15 Stanford,
losing 5-2.
Not only was this the final
match before the Michigan men's
tennis team fully dives into Big
Ten match play, but also the 18th
birthday for the 103rd-ranked
singles freshman Evan King.
King got down early in the first
set, recovered with a 4-3 lead in
the second set, only to fall to the
No. 8 Stanford sophomore Brad-

ley Klahn.
Michigan lost the doubles
match as King and Jung fell to the
No. 30 Stanford pair 8-5 as well
as sophomore Chris Madden and
freshman Chris Cha who fell 8-3.
"He's playing a very good dou-
bles team and all the players have
two, three years more experience
than him," Berque said of Jung.
"I was proud of him and the level
of competition he showed in the
doubles match."
Forty-sixth-ranked Michigan
doubles pair of seniors George
Navas and Mike Sroczynski bat-
tled the second-ranked Stanford
team in what turned out to be an
intense stalemate.
Down 1-4, Sroczynski and
Navas served back with multiple
wins to tie the match at 5-5.
Both teams faced multiple
advantage points, including an
ace by Sroczynski, before the
Cardinals edged out the Michi-
gan duo 8-7.
"They're both seniors and

they've played together since
their freshman year," Berque
said. "They're good friends,
study partners and roommates
for a part of their time here and
they've been through the ups and
downs together. They made a
decision before the season start-
ed to leave this program in better
shape than when they found it, so
I think they're playing with a lot
of pride."
Madden was the only other
Wolverine to score a victory in
the singles competition. Madden
exploded in the second set with a
6-0 victory after being down 2-6
in the first set to win 2-6, 6-0, 6-3.
Navas found himself in a nail-
biter that ended in a 6-3, 6-7 (10),
1-0 (10-6). On the sixth court, Cha
found himself battling back each
match 40-0, which resulted in a
3-6, 3-6 loss.
The Wolverines resume Big

Dufek seeks his own
legacy as- 'M' captain

Oaks aims to make transition
from outfielder to staff ace

By CAITLIN SMITH
Daily Sports Writer
Senior pitcher Alan Oaks has
often lived up to the role of "the
man."
In 2007,. during his freshman
year at Michigan, Oaks was "the
man" who had the pinch-hit,
walk-off home run against Col-
lege Player of the Year David Price
to win the Nashville Regional. A
week later, Price was the No.1 pick
in the MLB draft to the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays.
But, the coaches have taken
Oaks off the base and created
a new identity for him on the
mound. He is once again, "the
man" - the Friday-night pitcher.
The ace.
"He's going to be a tough guy
for any team to beat," Michigan
coach Rich Maloney said. "And
that's the kind of guy that is a
Friday-night pitcher. This is a
tremendous accomplishment for
Alan. It was his goal to be the
Friday-night pitcher and with his
limited experience, to say that
he's the guy, shows alot about his
work ethic and his drive to be the
best."
Oaks was recruited to Michigan
as the No. 1 prep player in Michi-
gan as a , two-way player.
His first preference was

to hit, so Maloney gave him the
opportunity.
Although Oaks had a powerful
swing, big moments came incon-
sistently for him.
So last season, when the Wol-
verines were struggling on the
mound, Maloney and Michigan
assistant coach Bob Keller took
a chance on Oaks and his golden
arm, putting him in the game to
pitch.
"Thankfully we did," Maloney
said. "From that point on, we felt
like for him to play at the next
level, knowing that his swing
was a little bit long, that his best
chance was probably going to be
on the bump. So we made that
move and to Alan's credit he has
excelled there in a short period of
time."
You could say that he has han-
dled the transition from an out-
field position player to ace pitcher
about as well as he handles the
ball on the mound. To prepare in
the offseason Oaks, who previous-
ly made a total of 10 appearances
at the mound in his freshman
and junior season, pitched in the
Florida collegiate league, did two
bullpens a week, and focused
on endurance and strength over
quickness and agility..
Besides working on the physical
aspects of the game, Oaks has also

taken on a new, less conventional
approach to improve his pitching.
"A recent tradition started
this year," Oaks said. "At the first
game, the umpire told me to take
off my Livestrong wristband and I
pitched really well that game. And
the next two weeks he told me
to do it again. But, the following
week he didn't ask me to remove
it, so I said, 'Hey, can you tell me to
take off my wristband?"'
Superstition or not, something
is working well for Oaks. This past
weekend, he recorded a career-
high 10 strikeouts against Ford-
ham - bettering his previous high
of seven, which he has reached
twice already this season. Oaks
is throwing a 90-92 mph fastball,
a low-80s slider and a high-70s
changeup.
"I can throw pretty hard in
my opinion," Oaks said. "So I like
to challenge the hitters and say,
'here it is if you can hit it, and good
luck.'"
Although Oaks struggled in the
beginning of his career to find a
consistent place on the field, he
was able to gain the experience
of batting against some of the top
pitchers in the nation. It might
be that because of this, Oaks
has learned just how to throw
in order to be "the man" on the
mound.

Look closely at Mike Dufek as he
strides out to his territory at first
base, and you'll see the typical gear:
a cap on his head, mitt on his hand,
ball in his back pocket.
If you get a good enough look,
you may even see a determined
expression on his face or eye black
smeared across his cheeks.
But what you won't see is the
sixty years worth of success, lead-
ership and Wolverine tradition that
follows his name everywhere he
goes.
The next time the senior fouls a
ball off his leg and opens up a cut,
try to look at the blood that comes
out.
It just might be maize and blue.
A FAMILIAR NAME
Those Michigan fans who have
attended football games for as long
as the Pope has attended mass smile
knowingly whenever Dufek's name
is announced at Ray Fisher Sta-
dium. Not necessarily for him, but
because they lnow about his prede-
cessors.
The first baseman's grandfa-
ther, Don Dufek Sr., was a standout
fullback for the Wolverines from
1948-50. His uncle, Don Jr., was
an All-American defensive back in
Ann Arbor from 1973-75, and his
uncle Bill played offensive tackle
for Michigan from 1974-78, also
attaining All-American status. All
the Dufek men would go on to play
in the NFL (as did Mike's father,
Joe, who played at Yale in his col-
lege days).
They were all leaders, too. Joe
played quarterback, the general on
the field; Don Sr. was chosen as the
team's MVP in 1950; and Don Jr.
was elected a captain both at Michi-
gan and during his career with the
Seattle Seahawks.
It's no wonder, then, that Mike
was selected as a co-captain for the
2010 season. Leadership is genetic
in the Dufek family.
"I definitely learned from my
uncles and my dad and my grand-
father," Dufek said after practice
Tuesday. "Everybody in my fam-
ily taught me the right way to do
things. I guess in the end, that real-
ly led to being a leader. Just leading
by example is the number one key
they all taught me the right way."
Despite his family's football ped-
igree, Dufek was blessed with much
greater baseball talent. And with all
of his connections to Ann Arbor,
Michigan was always the first base-
man's top choice. He first caught
the Wolverine coaches' eyes during
summer camps that Dufek attended
while in high school.
Those visits also confirmed his
interest in the school. The issue,
however, wasn't whether he want-
ed Michigan - it was whether
Michigan wanted him. Dufek
was lightly recruited as a pitcher/
outfielder coming out of Desert
Mountain High School in Scotts-
dale, Ariz. Since NCAA baseball
teams have fewer scholarships to
give than other major sports, even
a player of Dufek's caliber was not
guaranteed a full ride. If he were
to play for the Wolverines, it would
have to be in a walk-on role, at least
in the early part of his career. It
would also have to be at a new
position, as his athleticism limited
his potential in the outfield.
"(Recruiting Dufek) was easy in
the sense that he made it very clear
that he wanted to come, so that

was great," Michigan coach Rich
Maloney said. "It wasn't easy in the
sense that he really wanted to hit
and he wasn't blessed with a lot of
foot speed. It's tough if you're a hit-
ter who doesn't have a lot of speed,
so you got to really hit. And to his
credit, he really hits.
"We gave (the opportunity) to
him, and we're thankful we
did, because he's been a real-
ly good player for us."
That hitting prow-
ess led to a first
team All-Big Ten
season in 2009,
one in which he
hit .304 with

17 home runs and 59 RBI. The 17
homers led the team and all first
basemen in the conference - good
enough for third place all-time for
Michigan in asingle season.
And though Dufek isn't satisfied
with his power numbers so far in
2010 (he's slugging only .411, down
.216 from last season), he's still
managing a .329 batting average
with 20 runs knocked in.
TAKING CHARGE
The senior's leadership qualities
were so apparent early in his career
that it "really came as no surprise"
that he was selected as one of the
co-captains for this season, accord-
ing to senior utility man Mike Kit-
tIe.
"Everyone kind of had a pretty
good idea it was going to be Dufek
and (senior catcher Chris) Berset,"
Kittle said. "Him and Berset are
doing a good job keeping the team
together ... we wouldn't have voted
him captain if he didn't think he
could lead us. No doubt."
And the coaches supported the
choice. Maloney said that even as
a young player, when he wasn't
receiving a lot of playing time, he
could tell by Dufek's work ethic and
the way that he "meshed" with the
team that he had a shotcat becoming
a captain later in his career.
It was the same story for Dufek
in high school. Though the co-cap-
tain said he didn't really realize his
potential until his senior year, his
high school coach, Bryan Rice, saw
it much earlier.
"WhenImethimineighthgrade,
to tellyou the truth, he showed tre-
mendous potential," Rice said in a
phone interview. "That's the first
time I saw him and he just kept
getting better and better. Even as a
sophomore, he came up in the state
playoffs and got the bench all fired
up and was getting people going.
You could just tell he had a special
quality about him."
Dufek, for his part, was ready for
the challenge of leading at the col-
legiate level.
"When coach first told me, I
was excited to be put in that posi-
tion to help lead the team," Dufek
said. "We didn't have a great year
last year, so being a leader on the
team this year, I got a great chance
to kind of guide the way the season
will go. So far, we've had our downs,
but we want to be atcourbest during
Big Ten play."
The team has indeed struggled
somewhat so far, with its record
sitting at 9-9 heading into the long-
awaited home opener against Indi-
ana University-Purdue University
Fort Wayne today.
The Wolverines' rough start has
challenged their leaders to step up
and right the ship. The team has
leaned on Dufek and Berset to keep
everything afloat in the face of -an
extremely difficult schedule and
injuries to preseason All-American
Ryan LaMarre and the team's most
experienced returning pitcher

(senior lefthander Eric Katzman).
His teammates and coaches have
praised the first baseman for the
job he's been doing and for keeping
everythingtogether despite arough
start to the season.
"The hard part is having to tell
guys when they're not acting the
right way or they're not doing
something the right way," Dufek
said. "You've got to correct them on
and off the field, not being afraid to
pull a guy aside and have a talk with
them. You don't want to do it, but
sometimes every now and then it
has to happen.It doesn'thappen too
often, really. We have a good club-
house. These guys all have good
heads on their shoulders."
BUILDING A LEGACY
After this season, Dufek's future
is uncertain. If he performs well
enough, he has a shot at playing pro
ball (he was drafted by the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays in the 41st round of
the 2006 draft, before he even got to
Michigan).
But with his determination, work
ethic and leadership ability, Malo-
ney feels his success in any future
endeavor is almost guaranteed.
"When you're a leader, a lot of
people are going to want you,"
Maloney said. "So for whatever he
chooses, he's going to be a leader in
that profession. I fully expect that
he'll be outstanding."
Instead of worrying about that
right now, Dufek has more pressing
issues on his mind: returning the
Wolverines to their familiar spot
atop the Big Ten.
When asked what his top
achievement has been, he imme-
diately mentioned the two Big Ten
Championships the team won dur-
ing his freshman and sophomore
years (he waited until much later to
bring up his individual accomplish-
ments).
But those are two conference
crowns Michigan won before
Dufek became a big contributor.
Coming off of a disappointing sea-
son last year as a team, he is driven
that much more to cap his career
with a championship.
"You want to leave a champion,"
Maloney said. "He realized being a
champion (in) years one and two,
making some contribution, but not
(being) one of the.guys that we had
to lean on. Now it's his time, and for
us to try to win another champion-
ship, your legacy is what you do to
make that happen. That's the way I
look at it."
With the family he has, one
would think that the word "legacy"
would be something that weighs on
the co-captain. Is there any pres-
sure to live up to the Dufek legacy?
"Both my uncles and my grand-
father played football here and I
play baseball," Dufek said. "Totally
different sport. They're proud of
me no matter what happens on the
field, as long as I compete.
"But I hope if they did have any
expectations, they've been ful-
filled."
He is building his own legacy,
in a way - one he knows will be
defined by how this season ends.
Forget last year. The ingredients
are there for a Big Ten Champion-
ship run, something this program
has come to expect.
And it will be Dufek leading
the charge. In a fam-
ily of cham-
pions, he
will be attempting

to make his own name -
one synonymous with being a win-
ner on the baseball field. That will
be his legacy.
"I'm real proud to wear that jer-
sey," Dufek said. "There's a sense of
pride, but there's also a sense that
you're expected to win. So far, I've
been on teams that have won cham-
pionships, but lastyear was a pretty
big disappointment.
"I feel like I'm the Dufek that
played baseball instead of football
... but I also want to make my own
name by being a winner. I want to
be known as one of the captains
that led the team back to Big
Ten glory."
