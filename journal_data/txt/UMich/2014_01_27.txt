Mark Schlissel, Brown Uni-
versity's provost, will succeed
University President Mary Sue
Coleman as the University of

Michigan's 14th president. His
term will begin July 1.
The decision was unani-
mously approved by the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents at a
special meeting Friday morn-
ing in the Michigan Union's
Kuenzel Room. The announce-
ment arrives after a presidential
search committee spent much of
the summer and fall gathering
input from faculty and students
and the assistance of Russell
Reynolds Associates, an execu-
tive search advisory firm.

Schlissel will receive a base
salary of $750,000 per year with
an annual increase determined
by the regents. His contract runs
for five years. Coleman current-
ly receives $603,000 per year
in her role, but has denied an
increase several years in a row.
Schlissel began his term as
provost at Brown in 2011 after
serving as the University of
California-Berkeley's dean of
biological sciences from 2008 to
2011. As provost, Schlissel serves

Disappointed by lack

, though whom serve on SACUA.
sence of "Since SACUA had no involve-
sidential ment with the presidential search,
tee. we are not yet informed about the
iber fac- president-elect's unique qualifica-
e elected tions," said Astronomy Prof. Sally
- disap- Oey, a SACUA member. "We trust
bout the that he is an exceptional leader and
atives on we are excited to meet him and look
commit- forward to workingwithhim."
ich was Physics Prof. Finn Larsen,
y of the another SACUA member, shared
ents and similar sentiments regarding the
none of faculty's lack of prior information
aboutthe decision.
"This announcement is as
much news to me as it is to the
general public," Larsen said. "In
this situation, I look forward to
learn more about the new presi-
dent and his vision forthe Univer-
sity of Michigan."
In February of 2012, SACUA
passed a resolution urging the
ODAY! Board of Regents to ensure rep-
resentatives from the assembly
would have seats on the search
committee.
The board disregarded the
resolution, as they announced the
members of the committee in July
of 2013 appointing any assembly
members.
SACUA responded with anoth-
er resolution over the summer
4 expressing their "disappoint-
ment" with the regents' decision.
However, Regent Andrea
Fischer Newman (R), chair of the
Board of Regents, spoke of faculty
involvement in the search process
during the board's special meet-
ing Friday morning.
"On July 18, 2013, the regents
announced the appointment of
a presidential advisory search
committee ... that included the
entire board of regents and a
truly outstanding set of faculty
members," Newman said. "I
want to personally thank the
faculty members of the Presiden-
tial Search Advisory Committee.
This powerhouse group of dis-
tinguished faculty played a vital
role in the selection process, and
served as representatives of the
faculty as a whole."

Long hunt for
Coleman's successor
completed in secret
By YARDAIN AMRON
Daily StaffReporter
At Friday's special meeting of
the Board of Regents, the next
president of the University stood
out as the man with the biggest
beard in the front row. But short
of that, very few members of the
audience knew who he was before
the regents proposed his appoint-
ment.
Secrecy has become a staple of
a university presidential search,
with the hunt for the 14th presi-
dent being no exception.
The announcement of Brown
University Provost Mark Schlis-
sel as University President Mary
Sue Coleman's successor came as
a surprise to most, defying many
predictions of possible candi-
dates.
Business senior Michael
Proppe, Central Student Govern-
ment president, said he learned of
the choice at the same time as the
rest of the University community.
"That is the first time I've heard
his name," Proppe said. "I'm get-
ting good atpronouncing it."
Even now, most details about
the process, negotiations and
other candidates considered in
the nearly yearlong search will
likely not be released.
"We don't really discuss any-
thing related about the inner
workings of the search process in
that respect," Regent Katherine
White (D), head of the Presiden-
tial Search Advisory Committee,
said Friday.
The University contracted
the executive search firm Rus-
sell Reynolds Associates in June
to assist in identifying potential
presidential candidates after
Coleman announced her plan to
retire in mid-2013.
According to documents
obtained by The Michigan Daily
through a Freedom of Informa-

tion Act Request, the Univer-
sity hired the firm in May for
$300,000 excluding any addi-
tional expenses. The contract also
included a $7,500 flat cost recov-
ery charge for expenses such as
courier fees, copying and online
research.
The firm's associate expense
report through the third quarter
- which includes only a selection
of expenditures through Septem-
ber 2013 - totaled $12,250.69.
Alison Ranney and Ilene Nagel
were the chief Russell Reynolds
Associates consultants assigned
to the University's presidential
search. The documented expens-
es for their cross-country search
included airfare - specifically,
flights to Chicago, Baltimore and
Houston - hotel stays, car servic-
es and private meals with poten-
tial candidates.
On September 6, Nagel had
"breakfast with candidate for U"
for $72.06 - the only mention of
such a meeting in the reporting
available.
The University redacted much
of the expense report to make it
difficult to determine the iden-
tity of candidates they were con-
sidering. Reports for expenses,
including the month leading up
to the breakfast with a candidate,
were not included in the FOIA
response.
Ranney declined to comment
for this article.
Michael Poliakoff, vice presi-
dent of policy at the American
Council of Trustees and Alumni,
a non-profit organization that
works with faculty, alumni and
donors at colleges across the
United States, said search firms
should be used only for logistical
purposes, while the majority of
the search should be conducted
by the board.
But Poliakoff said the benefits
of secrecy also lend themselves to
the candidate's advantage.
"When you have secretive
searches, the candidates are in a
much better position to basically
shop and look for positions that
are more rewarding in one way

or another," Poliakoff said. "And
by not having to make a public
commitment to their candidacy,
that again strikes me as more and
more of the movement towards
the corporatization of executive
leadership in higher education."
Internally, the search com-
mittee gathered input within the
University from all corners of
campus to help them understand
what the community as a whole
was looking for in a president.
The announcement of the
committee last July came with
objection from members of the
Senate Assembly and students,
both of whom weren't represent-
ed on the committee.
Ata Senate Assembly meeting
on Sept. 23, members of SACUA
- a nine-member faculty execu-
tive committee elected by the
Senate Assembly - expressed
disappointment that they
weren't added to the search com-
mittee.
"The final committee did
have faculty but we did try to
distinguish between regular
faculty and faculty who are in
administrative positions," said
Engineering Prof. Robert Ziff, a
SACUA member. "We felt there
should be regular faculty in the
search."
Students also expressed dis-
satisfaction with their exclusion
from the committee, especially
since University alum Matt
Nolan, the 2002 Michigan
Assembly president, was includ-
ed during the last presidential
search.
Proppe said he was surprised
there was no student on the
search committee, but believed
the forums would provide suf-
ficient input.
"I would've loved to see
student representation on the
search, but that being said, I'm
pleased the Board of Regents
was able to hold a lot of forums
with members of the commu-
nity," Proppe said.

Schlissel kept lab
at Berkley even
after Brown move

Research to take main stage

Schlissel's final
Ph.D candidate
in California will
graduate in May
By AUSTEN HUFFORD
Online Editor
For many senior scientific
researchers at universities, their
days are spent writing grants
and telling younger researchers
what to do. Even though they are
in charge of a lab, their actual lab
time becomes nonexistent. But
University President-elect Mark
Schlissel continued to work in his
lab and run experiments even as
he climbed the academic ladder
at the University of California,
Berkeley.
Schlissel has authored or co-
authored more than 100 scien-
tific papers in his nearly three
decades of research. Much of his
work has focused on how immune
cells form from stem cells in bone
marrow. When this process goes
awry, cancers such as lymphoma
and leukemia can develop.
"Mark made seminal contri-
butions to the understanding of
the process," David Raulet, chair
of the Berkeley Department of
Molecular and Cellular Biology
said in an interview Friday.
His papers have appeared in
Nature, which has been dubbed
the most influential scientific
journal, and his work has been
cited almost 9,000 times, accord-
ing to Google Scholar. He has both
a M.D. and Ph.D. from Johns Hop-
kins University.
B lymphocytes, a large focus of
his research, form continuously
in the bone marrow and create

antibodies. They are also known
as B cells and are interesting for
scientists because they are cre-
ated by splitting and recombin-
ing different sections of genetic
material. This process results in
slightly different antibodies each
time, creating diversity and help-
ing the body fight off a wide array
of diseases.
Schlissel's work focused spe-
cifically on the formation of two
proteins called RAG-1 and RAG-
2. These proteins act as a sort of
molecular scissors, according to
David Schatz, a Yale University
immunobiology professor who
helped discover the proteins. The
Rag-1 and Rag-2 cut the genes and
allow them to be assembled into a
functional configuration that will
create antibodies.
Schlissel was interested in how
this cutting process was targeted
to the right location.
"Mark was recognized as one
of the leaders in the world in
the study of B cell development
and this recombination," Schatz
said.
Even as a provost at Brown
University, Schlissel continued to
publish papers, producing five in
2013. During his time at Brown,
he continued to work with his
Ph.D candidates at Berkeley to
help them finish. He would fly
back monthly and Skype with
them regularly, according to
Kwan Chow, who was one of his
students and now is a postdoc-
toral fellow at the University of
Washington.
Schlissel's head may be in
administration, but his heart is
still in research.
"This was his life," Chow said.
"He ran a lab. Two years doing
administrative work isn't going to
erase that."

Schlissel will return
to roots in science
following Coleman's
retirement
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily News Editor
In the realm of research
funding, University President-
elect Mark Schlissel has a tough
act to follow. To be precise, a
$581 million act - how much
the research budget has bal-
looned since University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman took
office in August 2002.
Research expenditures have
doubled in the past decade,
according to David Lampe,
executive director of research
communications. The Uni-
versity is regarded as a one
of the nation's premiere
research insitution, second
only to The Johns Hopkins
University in total research
expenditure.
Givenslashesinstate and fed-
eral funding, though, research
funding will be at at significant
risk in future budget cycles.
In an interview Friday, S.
Jack Hu, interim vice president
for research, said financing the
University's massive research
enterpriseisthebiggestlong-term
challenge the president-elect will
face. Hu was selected last year to
fill the role vacated by Stephen
Forrest, who returned to full-
time researching and teaching
after overseeing the University's
research portfolio for sevenyears.
During Forrest's tenure, the
University's research expenditures
increased from $800 million in
2008toover $1.3 billion lastyear.
Still, Schlissel said at a press
conference Friday that he was
optimistic about maintaining or
increasingthe financingthe Uni-
versity's massive research enter-
prise is the budget over time.
"I think there's enough sup-

port in the leadership of our
country that, as our economy
recovers, as our economy
is investing in the future, a
big part of which is funding
discovery and research will
recover as well."
From East Coast student to
public institute president
Schlissel, who holds a M.D.
and Ph.D from The Johns Hop-
kins University, has extensive
research experience in medical-
related fields.
Before becoming provost
at Brown University, he was
dean of biological sciences at
the University of California,
Berkeley during the system's
severe budget crisis of 2009 to
2010. Mark Richards, execu-
tive dean of mathematical and
physical sciences at Berkeley,
said Schlissel was involved in
a campus wide effort to protect
as many of Berkeley's academic
resources as possible during
the recession's onset.
"He was working with man-
aging a terrible budget situa-
tion," Richards said.
Currently, 11 percent of
Berkeley's funding is from the
state of California, compared
to 17 percent in Michigan.
Richards added that Schlis-
sel led new research initiatives
in the biological sciences in
collaboration with the Univer-
sity of California, San Francis-
co Medical Campus.
As Brown University Pro-
vost, Schlissel led the estab-
lishment of the School of
Public Health, the expansion
of the School of Engineering
and Brown's STEM education
initiative, Brown University
President Christina Paxson
wrote in a letter to the univer-
sity community.
"He has been integrally
involved in space and capital
planning efforts, guiding $200
million in investments to bol-
ster the University's teaching,

research and campus life infra-
structure," Paxson wrote.
Richards said his former col-
league, whose office was next
door when he was a dean at
Berkeley, was a decisive leader.
"Universities can be very
change resistant," Richards
said. "I would say he is a person
who wants to lead an organiza-
tion fairly aggressively into the
future rather than preserving
whatever is there."
Research funding: Paltry
or powerful?
Such a maverick may be nec-
essary to confront the uncertain
funding situation looming overthe
University's researchportfolio.
The fiscal year 2013 research
budget was a record $1.33 bil-
lion, according to Lampe. That
cycle, the National Science
Foundation, National Aeronau-
tics and Space Administration
and other federal departments
all increased their sponsorship
of university research, a Uni-
versity press release stated. The
National Institutes of Health,
though, decreased their support
for University research.
The situation may change
as with a $1 billion increase to
the NIH's funding compared to
before the sequester in FY2013,
according to Matt Williams,
press secretary for Sen. Debbie
Stabenow (D-Mich). However,
the amount allocated to the
NIH is not guaranteed to any
university, Williams said, so an
overall increase in NIH funds
does not guarantee an increase
for the University's.
One potential solution to off-
set a decline in public support
is to seek funding from private
foundations and companies -
an avenue that Schlissel praised
in his remarks Friday.
"I remember reading that a
very significant portion of the
research dollars spent here
were raised from non-govern-
mental sources as well, founda-

tions and donors, in addition to
relying on the federal govern-
ment," he said.
A new means to money
one conduit is industry sup-
port, Lampe said. He high-
lighted the University's growing
involvement in energy and
transportation research, like the
public-private partnership in the
Mobility Transformation Center.
Lampe described the push to
identify growth areas in which
government and industry both
seek research.
"We are being flexible in see-
ing what priorities the federal
government and industry have,"
Lampe said. "We are matching
where we see our strengths and
where they match with what
industry needs."
Lampe added that the Uni-
versity continues to empha-
size its "great strengths" in the
health system, which is also the
biggest part of federally sup-
ported research.
Schlissel also led new
research initiatives in the bio-
logical science at Berkeley,
Richards said, and was called
a "seminal" researcher in his
field.
"He listens to arguments,
he thinks about things and he
makes decisions," Richards
said. "And I think a university
president has to do that."
A university president, how-
ever, takes a bigger picture
approach to research. Lampe
described Coleman as an advo-
cate for the importance of uni-
versity research.
"Research is closely coupled
with the education process
here," Lampe said, "It's integral
with graduate education and
increasingly so with under-
graduate. It is through our
research that we are able to
make our students to be the
innovators that are economi-
cally successful and competi-
tive."

last year that aims to raise at least $4 bil-
lion. Schlissel must emulate, if not surpass,
Coleman's extraordinary run at fundraising
for the school. Schlissel will have to keep
in mind that unlike Brown - a private Ivy
League school with merely one-fifth of U of
M's student population - Michigan is a large
public school with a diverse student popula-
tion and alumni. As such, he must facilitate
these funds to ensure that less prominent
schools such as the School of Nursing and
the School of Music, Theatre and Dance can
compete on even footing with already well
endowed units - such as the Ross School of
Business or the Athletic Department.
Arguably, Schlissel's greatest attribute is
his strong background in scientific research.
The University is the top public university for
research, spending $1.3 billion last year alone.
Given Schlissel's demonstrated commitment
to research, there is little doubt that his ten-
ure as president will let that slip. Schlissel
should continue to further expand the Uni-
versity's research efforts. It is clear that this
is Schlissel's primary area of expertise, and
his presidency should push research - but not
at the expense of other essential University
priorities. It is important that Schlissel main-
tains the University's commitment to under-
graduate teaching in addition to research that
happens at the graduate and faculty level.
Furthermore, the University has a strong
history of social engagement. President John
F. Kennedy founded the Peace Corps on the
steps of the Union. The University was a cata-
lyst for protest movements in the seventies,
and the student body has demonstrated a
clear interest in peace and justice even today.
The new president cannot ignore this broad
tradition of excellent engagement. His inter-
ests in research - especially in the sciences
- should combine with the school's tradition
of innovation in a way that directly benefits
the students and the global community. Spe-
cifically, Schlissel should promote research in;
sustainable energy. His scientific background
should inform decisions that utilize that
knowledge, while also reducing the school's
financial investments in fossil fuels. Colman
began a sustainability campaign during her

presidency, during which the University saw
marked improvements towards sustainabil-
ity. Schlissel should expand this effort and
bring a new perspective.
As the president of a university that enrolls
nearly 44,000 students, Schlissel needs to
devote significant attention and resources to
supportingthe student body. While at Brown,
Schlissel championed an affordable educa-
tion, arguing that barriers to entry could
restrict the demographic makeup of the stu-
dent body. Not only can tuition hikes detract
from racial diversity, but they can create a
socioeconomically homogeneous campus.
With recent concerns about falling accep-
tance rates for low income students, Schlis-
sel must keep his passion for keeping college
affordable and accessible.
Recently,culturally offensive incidents and
a steady drop in minority enrollment have sug-
gested a lack of campus diversity and cultural
awareness. Strong efforts by the Black Student
Union this academic year - spearheading the
#BBUM campaign and their recent protest on
Martin Luther King, Jr. Day - have helped
initiate these discussions. The University has
longbranded itself as adiverse institutionwith
a culture of tolerance. In his tenure Schlissel
will be responsible for maintaining the high
standards this University has set for itself.
Finally, the regents' failure to include a
student representative on the Presidential
Search Advisory Committee should not set a
precedent for the new president-elect. A trou-
bling pattern of discountingstudent voice has
manifested since the beginning of the 2013-
2014 academic year. University administra-
tion has revised a number of its policies that
affect a large proportion of students, forgo-
ing their input. Last semester, the Athletic
Department abruptly changed the key poli-
cies forfootball games and basketball games
without attempting to consult with students.
Student voice is crucial to the advancement of
any educational system; Schlissel's willing-
ness to incorporate these voices will reflect
the University's commitment to its students.
Undoubtedly, running a top public univer-
sity comes with seemingly endless and insur-
mountable difficulties. Yet, President-elect
Schlissel's leadership at UC Berkeley - as a
professor and dean - and as Brown's Provost
shows that he is prepared to put students first
and lead the University into a progressive
new era.

nly days into knowing that
Dr. Mark Schlissel will
become the University's
14th president,
it's admittedly
difficult to find,
any significant
criticisms of
the Board of
Regents' selec-
tion - making
writing this DEREK
column a much WOLFE
more challeng-
ing task.
Before even taking the podium to
deliver his opening remarks during
the regents' special meeting Friday in
the Union, Schlissel's rdsume spoke
for itself. He's an M.D. and Ph.D.
with more than 100 research papers
to his name. He is currently the pro-
vost at Brown University, but before
that spent more than a decade at the
University of California, Berkeley in
various positions, including dean of
biological sciences. By all accounts,
he is a scholar - an impressive one at
that - who is clearly qualified for the
job and should be taken seriously in
this respect.
But career accomplishments aside,
Schlissel's initial words to the media,
administrators, faculty and those
watching online exuded a sense of
warmth, openness and intelligence.
"My motivation as an academic
leader stems from a personal belief
that understanding and discovery
can change the world and that edu-
cation is the key to achieving social
equity and economic progress,"
he said.
Regent Mark Bernstein (D-Ann
Arbor) also recounted a moment
in the interviewing process, dur-
ing which Schlissel was asked what
makes a great university president.
Schlissel answered by saying,
"You have to love and be amazed
by students. You have to love and
be amazed by faculty. You have to
love and be amazed by research

and discovery."
Sure, this is all academic rheto-
ric. But his tone demonstrated to
me a true passion for academia as a
whole, for faculty and for students
- he did spend almost eight years
in graduate school, after all. Really,
he came off as someone with whom
you'd want to get lunch, which is
perhaps the greatest compliment
of all.
However, it was also obvious
he's not a "Michigan Man" and has
much to learn about Ann Arbor and
the University - he referred to the
restaurant at which he ate during a
secret tour as "the wonderful deli in
town." Yes, he's talking about Zing-
erman's. Oh, how innocent.
That being said, he acknowledg-
es his lack of knowledge about the
University, and his preparedness to
listen is admirable. As he said, "The
best ideas come from the people
who do the teaching and the learn-
ing, so that's why I need to do some
listening first."
We can only hope he will follow
through on this promise to listen to
students. But while it's encourag-
ing to see someone who wants to
embrace the University before imple-
menting his own goals, it can only
last so long before significant action
is required.
For example, the #BBUM cam-
paign is only the tip of the iceberg
of the significant diversity issues
on campus. And while the Univer-
sity attempted to address concerns
through an e-mail sent by Provost
Martha Pollack to the University
community on Jan. 16, they are
issues that won't be reconciled by
the time Schlissel takes office.
It was promisingto hear Schlissel
speak on the importance of diversi-
ty during the press conference. He
said, "You can't achieve excellence
as an academic institution without
being diverse because we live in a
world where people can look at the
same set of facts and interpret them

differently from each other."
Given this standard he has
set, it should be expected that he
understands the ongoing diversity
issues on campus and subsequently
makes a concerted effort to actually
address them early in his presidency
- something beyond the "we're lis-
tening" comments we've grown so
accustomed to. And if he fails to do
so, he should be held accountable.
His skills in handling the Vic-
tors for Michigan campaign will
also prove critical to the well-being
of students, given the goal of rais-
ing $1 billion for financial aid pur-
poses. Unlike current University
President Mary Sue Coleman, who
was the president of the University
of Iowa before coming to the Uni-
versity, Schlissel has never held a
position that requires significant
fundraising duties beyond filling
out grants for research projects or
possibly minor initiatives when he
was a dean. He must find a way to
be committed to providing stu-
dents with an affordable education,
despite his lack of experience.
In all, even with these concerns,
Schlissel made a fantastic first
impression in appealing to both
faculty and students. It appears
that he is ready to tackle the chal-
lenge of running one of the United
States' premier institutions despite
being a somewhat surprising selec-
tion - a topic that Michael Proppe,
president of Central Student Gov-
ernment, spoke about.
"He was not one of the names
we'd heard floating around, so
people are really excited to engage
with him and get to know him,"
Proppe said.
But with his term beginning July
1, that gives us plenty of time to learn
more about him as well. And we can
start with figuring out how to pro-
nounce his name.

A sharp divide

ne day, two impacts. One audience,
two speeches. One language, two
messages.
This past Martin Luther
King, Jr. Day, a day meant:
to honor unity and togeth-
erness, was a moment
filled with divides born'
from our commonalities. F
The pivotal day turned
into the backdrop for Uni-
versity President Mary Sue
Coleman and members of MAJA
the Black Student Union TOSIC
to share their separate
proclamations. Their inti-
mately tied and uniquely
distinct messages created an important jux-
taposition that needs to be examined. The
differences between the two span beyond the
order of their words.
One voice made promises. The ability to
make promises to others carries much power
and agency.
The other made demands. Demands echo a
history of being unheard and misrepresented.
One speaker simply had to approach the
podium and be welcomed by an applauding
audience. Her voice was soft into the micro-
phone, but it was amplified instantly for hun-
dreds of ears to hear.
The other speakers had to take command
of a space that routinely excluded them. They
had to create a stage of their own. They had
to shout over others to be heard. They had to
captivate the audience to be recognized.
One act was a welcomed speech.
And the other was seen as a disturbance.
One voice is the epitome of power and
authority.
The other is systematically silenced.
One is white.
The other is Black. Dark as the fierce night
and light as the blinding day.
One voice was wholeheartedly respected.
The other was misconstrued and misrep-
resented.
Despite their divides, both voices stra-
tegically chose MLK Day as the important
moment to unveil their messages. But they

chose the same day for very different reasons.
MLK Day is a time of reflection, a pause in
our lives to compare the past to the present.
Both groups - the administration and the
BSU students - chose this moment of reflec-
tion because it primed their audience and
strengthened their messages. However, the
spirit and story of King was pulled into dif-
ferent directions by the two.
One took MLK Day and the spirit to cham-
pion his legacy and to prove how far the Uni-
versity has come.
The other took the essence of King and
came to embody his rebellious and truth-
seeking nature.
One used King's legacy as a marker of prog-
ress and success.
The other looked back onto King to portray
how little has changed.
Perhaps one message washed us in more
hard-to-believe tales.
And perhaps the other voice fought to
restore sight to those who are blind.
So, where does the truth lie?
Perhaps it lies in the messages and
responses. Coleman spoke about the changes
the administration vows to take. She listed
three separate and immediate steps that are
solutions to the concerns students of color
and the BSU have raised. She said the BSU
students have been heard. But have they? Or
has their threat to the Victors Campaign and
to her own legacy been heard?
In response to the BSU students' demon-
stration, some members of the administration
met with students this past Friday to discuss
future steps. The students left feeling hope-
ful, and maybe the administration left feeling
relieved. But the past tells us to be cautious
in believing that the University will listen to
students seeking more diversity and inclu-
sivity. The University has consistently shied
away from complying with student demands
and creating a truly inclusive community.
Only time will tell how much the students
have been heard. Then we will know where
the truth lies.

EMILY HILL AND CAT KNOERR |
In solidarity with BSU

We, the executive board of Unit-
ed Asian American Organizations,
publicly declare our support for the
Black Student Union and the seven
demands they made to the Univer-
sity.
We represent a community com-
prised of students of color on campus
that is both affected by and involved
in institutional oppression. While
we cannot claim to face the exact
same challenges that Black students
face on this campus, we can relate to
feelings of marginalization in spaces
reserved for our education. Members
of our community can sympathize
with struggling to be able to both
express ourselves as people of color
and implement change, because of a
dearth of resources available to us.
Currently, the Trotter Multicultural
Center is inconveniently located on
the outskirts of campus, inadequate
not only as a visible space on cam-
pus, but also as a supporting resource
for the various communities of color
at the University. Our community
would like to see a more centralized
center that would change the racial
climate on campus and allow for
greater awareness of issues students
of color face.
There are a good number of not
only Asian/Pacific Islander Ameri-

can students, but also students
in general, who have not had the
privilege of taking ethnic studies
classes and who should be given the
opportunity to be educated on the
marginalized treatment and his-
torical resistance their communi-
ties have faced. It is very important
to build tolerance and respect on
this campus. This can be achieved
through education and understand-
ing. We support the demand that
all colleges and schools within the
University should have race/eth-
nicity requirements, as we believe
it would allow for greater, more
widespread conversations on the
treatment of groups of color.
These demands are not an
increase of "special privileges" for
only a select group of students, but
are a call for increased equity and
equality that will widely benefit
students and faculty of this univer-
sity for years to come. This is not a
claiming of resources that will be
taken away from others. This is a
push for a more diverse and accept-
ing higher education space. We
want to embrace the University of
Michigan as our home and - one
day - beloved alma mater, but our
experiences of feeling like outsid-
ers hinder our ability to do so. It

is time for the administration to
recognize our struggles and rec-
tify the experiences of current and
future students.
We have also heard the Univer-
sity constantly use the phrase, "We
are listening," yet our voices have
been silenced. We hope to see an
institution that has been built on
a tradition of progressive thinking
seriously respond to the demands of
its students. We are all Wolverines
looking for tolerance and respect
not only in our communities, but in
every area of campus. Productive
conversation, but more importantly
action spurred by conversation, are
necessary for a more inclusive and
diverse university. We support and
are encouraged by the demands and
actions of the BSU and hope that
the University will continue totake
steps toward creating a campus that
is welcoming and equitable to all
students. United Asian American
Organizations invites any student
or coalition to reach out, converse
and take action on this issue that
affects all students of color.

SCHLISSEL
From Page 1A
as Brown's chief academic officer
and deputy to the president. In
his current role, Schlissel man-
ages the day-to-day operations
of the institution and oversees
Brown's strategic planning.
In a press conference after the
regents approved the appoint-
ment, Schlissel addressed the
challenges he expects to face
as the next president, including
enhancing diversity on campus,
increasing affordability and
developing relationships with
potential donors to the Univer-
sity.
Schlissel said his biggest chal-
lenge will be engaging with
students, faculty and staff on
campus, adding that he has a
lot to learn since he has never
worked at the University.
"In my experience, univer-
sities really don't get led top-
down," he said. "The best ideas
come from the people who do
the teaching and the learning, so
that's why I need to do some lis-
tening first."
While Schlissel will face many
issues in his transition, one of the
most prominent matters he will
address is the demand for larger
minority enrollment and inclu-
sion at the University.
"You can't achieve excellence
as an academic institution with-
out being diverse because we live
in a world where people can look
at the same set of facts and inter-
pret them differently from each
other," he said.
In addition to diversity,

Schlissel appealed to a wide
scope of the constituencies, cit-
ing the University's alumni and
staff members as well as the Ann
Arbor community, in addition to
the expected listing of faculty,
students and regents.
He also noted the University's
stature as a public institution -
despite the challenges of declin-
ing state funding - as a key draw
to the University.
"Another thing that made me
say Michigan is a place I really
have to look at is my feeling
about the role education can play
in solving society's problems,"
Schlissel said. "And it's not that
we don't do this at great private
university - we do - but there's
something about the openness
and the accessibility of a public
universities that's really special
and it drew at my heartstrings."
Coleman lauded Schlissel's
experience and qualifications as
the next president of the Univer-
sity.
"I've often said the job of
being president at the University
of Michigan is the best job in the
country," she said. "I couldn't be
more pleased to know that you,
as the 14th president, will expe-
rience this firsthand."
Before approving Schlissel's
appointment as president, each
regent lauded his qualifications
for the position.
"This is a great day for the Uni-
versity of Michigan. We go today
from strength to strength; from
one great leader, Mary Sue Cole-
man, to another, Mark Schlissel,"
said University Regent Mark
Bernstein (D-Ann Arbor).
Bernstein recalled Schlis-
sel's answer to one of the central

questions that faced the search
committee: What makes a great
university president?
"You have to love and be
amazed by students. You have to
love and be amazed by faculty.
You have to love and be amazed
by research and discovery."
In an interview after the press
conference, University Provost
Martha Pollack, who will per-
haps work most closely with the
new president, praised Schlis-
sel's academic record, as well
as his interest in faculty and
research and commitment to
diversity and affordability.
"You heard the regents talk
about him having great ethics,
great values and a great heart -
that's just the combination you
want," Pollack said.
She added that she will have
a one-on-one meeting with the
president-elect Friday afternoon
as she begins to share knowledge
and understand how to best work
with him.
Though this was her first
introduction to the University's
14th president, E. Royster Harp-
er, vice president for student life,
said she saw Schlissel as some-
one who could build on Cole-
man's strengths.
"Regent Bernstein said it
just right - we're going from
strength to strength," Harper
said. "I love the fact that he is so
student-centered, because our
students are used to that and
deserve that."
Schlissel will also direct the
remainder of the University's
Victors for Michigan develop-
ment campaign, which aims to
raise $4 billion in funds.
Jerry May, vice president for

development, said he thinks
Schlissel will easily form rela-
tionships with donors as he pre-
pares to raise about half of the
campaign goal. May also called
attention to Schlissel's apparent
willingness to listen and ability
to form a vision for the Univer-
sity.
"He is articulate, he is real,
he is genuine, he has an incred-
ible pedigree," May said. "I was
astounded that he could answer
things as if he's been on this
campus for months. The alumni
and donors are goingto love him.
The instinct that I've seen today
is that this is a no-brainer. This
guy is going to do great."
When Schlissel arrived at
Brown in 2011, he gave a convo-
cation address which called on
students to channel synergies
across disciplines, a theme that
he echoed in his first address as
president-elect.
"Don't simply accept what
your professors have to say, but
question us. Approach our teach-
ings like a curious scientist and
look for the facts that underlie
our interpretations and opinions;
the data that leads to our conclu-
sions," he said.
Schlissel graduated from
Princeton University in 1979
with a specialty in biochemical
sciences. He earned his M.D.
and Ph.D. at the Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine in
1986, subsequently completing
his residency at Johns Hopkins
Hospital.
During his academic career,
Schlissel's research has centered
on development biology, specifi-
cally studyingthe genetic factors
that can lead to leukemia and

lymphoma.
Schlissel attended the special
meeting of the Board of Regents
with his wife Monica Schwebs,
who also received accolades
from the regents. She is an envi-
ronmental and energy lawyer at
a large national firm. The couple
has four adult children.
In a press release, Brown Uni-
versity President Christina Pax-
son praised Schlissel's work in
his position as provost.
"Mark is an exceptional schol-
ar, teacher and academic leader,"
Paxson wrote. "He has been an
esteemed and valued colleague
to many here at Brown. His many
contributions will be realized for
decades to come."
Paxson said Schlissel led sev-
eral searches for administrative
positions for Brown's faculty,
including the search for its vice
president of research and its
dean of medicine and biological
sciences.
The University has several
dean searches underway as
Schlissel makes his transition
into the presidency, including the
appointment of the LSA dean and
the vice president for research,
currently held by Susan Gelman
and Jack Hu, respectively, in
interim positions.
At Brown, Schlissel helped
lead a new strategic initiative
titled "Building on Distinction:
A New Plan for Brown." The plan
established goals for investment
in academic programs, scholar-
ships and campus expansion.
The four goals of the cam-
paign include integrative schol-
arship, educational leadership,
academic excellence and cam-
pus development. The plans are

Monday, January 27, 2014 - 5A
designed to be implemented over
the course of the next 10 years.
While a dean at UC-Berkeley,
Schlissel also spearheaded a
cross-campus cost containment
and procurement initiative -
efforts which have also been
underway at the University for
the past few years.
In an article by the Daily Her-
ald, Schlissel detailed changes
in Brown's curriculum develop-
ment. One of the projects Schlis-
sel championed includes the
implementation of a theme for
the school's International Stud-
ies program.
However, Brown's faculty
raised several concerns about
the strategic plan. Paxson and
Schlissel created forums to
address their questions, includ-
ing questions of heightening
student enrollment to alleviate
increasing tuition costs.
"We are a very tuition-
dependent university," Schlis-
sel said. "The idea is to strike
the right balance, to hit the
sweet spot without giving up
the kind of highly interactive
mode of education that makes
the undergraduate program
so special to allow us to get to
the scale where we can capture
efficiencies."
In a short speech after his
appointment Friday, Schlissel
expressed excitement about
joining the University commu-
nity.
"I am amazingly honored
to be chosen to lead a jewel
of the American educational
system," he said. "The Univer=
sity of Michigan is held in such
regard. Words almost escape
me."


CSG leaders look
ahead to Schlissel

Students anticipate
president-elect will
engage with them
upon arrival
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
and KRISTEN FEDOR
Daily StaffReporters
The search for a new Univer-
sity president lacked a student
representative on the search
committee. Now, the search is
over and it seems that for Uni-
versity President-elect Mark
Schlissel, improving commu-
nication with students will be a
top priority.
The University's Board of
Regents announced in a special
meeting Friday morning that
Schlissel, Brown University's
Provost, will succeed Mary Sue
Coleman as the University's
14th president.
Central Student Government
President Michael Proppe, a
Business senior, said he was
proud of the work students con-
tributed to the selection process,
despite the absence of a student
voice on the search committee.
In lieu of direct representation,
he urged student participation in
community forums held by the
regents as well as CSG's campus
life survey.
Thursday night, the eve of
the announcement of Schlis-
sel's selection, Proppe outlined
three major issues he hoped the
new president would strive to
address: diversity on campus;
education affordability and the
incorporation of student voice
into major University decisions.
"When I heard him speak,
I wondered if he had been
dropping in on some of my
phone calls," Proppe said after
the press conference Friday.
"He was echoing all of those
themes, which was exactly
what I wanted to hear."
Proppe added that he was
enthusiastic about Schlissel's
"student-centric" approach,
which he was known for at
Brown. Todd Harris, presi-
dent of Brown's Undergraduate
Council of Students, said work-
ing with students was one of
Schlissel's strengths.
Harris said Schlissel helped
the council acquire representa-
tion in discussions about Brown's
12-year strategic plan, allow-
ing student delegates to voice
concerns and contribute ideas.
Schlissel was also the chair of
the University Resource Com-
mittee, with which the student
government worked to increase

funding for student activities.
CSG Vice President Bobby
Dishell, a Public Policy junior,
said he is optimistic for Schlis-
sel's approach to decision-mak-
ing.
"(Schlissel) mentioned
working with students at every
opportunity that he had,"
Dishell said of Friday's press
conference with the president-
elect. "That's something that
we're very much looking for-
ward to, and every student
should be very excited about."
Rackham Student Govern-
ment President Phil Saccone, a
Rackham student, said increased
communication between the
administration and student body
is necessary -especiallyinlightof
recent friction over the construc-
tion of new graduate residences
donated by Charles Munger. The
project has faced opposition from
students who criticized the hall's
designand cost.
"It comes off occasionally like
sometimes student input seems
like an afterthought," Saccone
said. "One thing I would say to
the new president is to go out and
touch base with the real pulse
of the University, and that's the
students."
Proppe agreed with Saccone,
identifying the football seat-
ing policy as another topic that
has created conflict between
students and the administra-
tion. He said meetings between
CSG executives and the Athletic
Department about improving
student ticketing policies have
helped identify the need for stu-
dent input in University deci-
sions.
"They have seen, 'If we con-
sult with students before we do
something, we will have a bet-
ter output for it,"' Proppe said.
"When the students can work
with the administration in a pos-
itive way to create win-win situ-
ations, and when the students
demonstrate that we can do that,
we see the student voice grow a
little bit more."
Proppe alluded to poten-
tial "good news" in the coming
months that will help to increase
student representation at the
administrative level and said he
hopes that Schlissel would facili-
tate this kind of growth.
In Schlissel's first steps toward
outreach in the student commu-
nity, he held a meet-and-greet for
30 to 40 students following Fri-
day morning's press conference.
To cap off the day's events, some

President-elect to hay4

On the Cube

unique UMHS

ties of running the University's 19
schools and colleges, University
President-elect Mark Schlissel will
be responsible for managing the
University's Health System, which
accounts for about 44 percent of the
University's expenses, according the
toUniversity's2013 financial report
Schlissel, however, will bring a
unique perspective to the health
system given his background in
researchand clinical medicine.
"I'm thrilled that they selected
another biochemist," University
President Mary Sue Coleman said
at the announcement on Friday
morning.
Similar to his predecessor,
Schlissel spent the early part of
his career conducting laborato-
ry research. He graduated from
Princeton University in 1979 with
a degree in biological sciences and
obtained both an M.D. and Ph.D in
physiological chemistry from The
Johns Hopkins Universityin1986.
"(I have) a strong and person-
al belief in the ability of education
to transform lives and the under-
standing that academic excellence
and diversity are inextricably
linked," Schlissel said.
Women's Studies Prof. Timothy
R.B. Johnson, chair of obstetrics
and gynecology at the Medical
School, served on the presidential
advisory search committee and
said the committee looked for a
candidate with a strong record of
undergraduate and graduate educa-
tion, but who also had experience in
health systemmanagement.
Although the committee desired
a candidate with medical experi-
ence,the president's responsibilities
extend well beyond medical care,
making it difficult to find someone
who strikes the right balance.
"The health system was an
important consideration for the
search committee," Johnson said.
"I think (Schlissel) had alot of very
good experience with the challeng-
es faced with health centers."
In recent years, Coleman has
taken an active role in the manage-
mentoftheUMHS,servingaschair
ofthe Hospitals and HealthCenters
Executive Board. Johnson said he
anticipates Schlissel will adopt a

experience with three different
healthcare institutions, which fac-
tored into the selection process,
Johnsonsaid.
Johns Hopkins Health System,
where Schlissel served as a faculty
member, employs a similar style of
vertical integration to the Univer-
sity, demonstrating to the search
committee that he was capable of
performing as head of UMHS.
The University of California,
Berkeley does not have an affiliat-
ed health system, but Johnson said
Schlisseldemonstrated adedication
to undergraduate education during
his tenure at the institution. Schlis-
sel continued collaborating with
graduate students at the Berkeley
even after he left, flying from the
East Coast to California once a
month to make sure his students
graduated on time. His last student
is set to graduate in May.
"We wanted someone who could
do everything at the University
and we wanted someone who had
experience with undergraduate
education - what teaching under-
graduatesawas like," Johnson said.
At his current position as Brown
University's Provost, Schlissel was
given responsibilityofmedical edu-
cation. However, Brown doesn't
manage its own hospital, so Schlis-
sel was instead responsible for a
wide array of private facilities affili-
ated with the university.
Uponstartinghis tenure as pres-
ident, Schlissel will face some of the
same challenges he encountered at
other centers and some unique to
the University.
Perhapsathe greatest challenge is
the financialuncertainty created by
the implementation of the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act.
While the law was enacted in 2010,
implementation of the most influ-
ential regulations - primarily the
government-mandated purchase
of health insurance - didn't begin
until late 2013. Health systems
around the nation are therefore still
adjusting to changes in coverage,
Johnsonsaid.
"Nobody likes uncertainty -
the markets don't like uncertainty,
healthsystems don't like uncertain-
ty," Johnson said. "We're probably
facing more uncertainty now, over
the next two or three years, than
we've seen in along time."

O UT E AS T
t Brown'U,
students say
provost plays
integral role

Schlissel sought-
campus perspectiye.
for budget and
strategic planning
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily StaffReporter
As University President-elect
Mark Schlissel makes the tran-
sition from Rhode Island to
Michigan, the Brown Universi-
ty provost will leave a positive
legacy behind in his dealings
with students and the rest of the
Brown community.
Brown University senior
Daniel Pipkin, a member of the
University Resources Com-
mittee - a standing commit-
tee chaired by Schlissel that is
responsible for recommending
Brown's annual budget to the
president - said he has had
nothing but positive experienc-
es with Schlissel.
As a member of Brown's
Undergraduate Council of Stu-
dents, the university's student
government, Pipkin met with
Schlissel during his sophomore
year to discuss the best way
to distribute funding for stub-
dent organizations. Within one
meeting, Schlissel and I'in
fixed the funding issues, which
Pipkin said is just one example
of the problem-solving chops
Schlissel will bringto the Uni-
versity.
"Provost Schlissel was bril-
liant," Pipkin said. "He's a fixer;
he's a problem-solver. I love that
about him."
And Schlissel will need those
problem-solving skills when
he comes to Ann Arbor. With
high-profile issues such as high-
er education funding, the ongo-
ing efforts behind the #BBUM
campaign, Theta Xi's contro-
versial party and subsequent
suspension and even the issue
of whether or not to hang the
Men's Basketball Final Four ban-
ners all still fresh in the minds of
many at the University, it is clear
Schlissel will face a diverse array
of new challenges.
However, Pipkin said Schlis--

sel doesn't shy away from
addressing controversial issues
on campus, and will keep the
best interests of the community
in mind when making decisions,
regardless of personal opinion.
"I know he's going to do a
great job over there (at the Uni-
versity)," he said. "I'm happy
I'm a senior, because I couldn't
imagine Brown without Provost
Schlissel."
Brown medical student Justin
Glavis-Bloom, who also serves
on the University Resource
Committee with Schlissel as the
Medical School representative,
echoed Pipkin and said Schlissel
is receptive to student ideas and
input.
Glavis-Bloom said he was
"deeply impressed" when, after
work one evening, Schlissel
drove to the Brown Student
Community Clinic, a student-run
clinic that helps underserved
populations in the area. Schlis-
sel, who has both an M.D. and
a Ph.D., stayed for more than an
hour, sharing his own experienc-
es and perspective with the stu-
dents at the clinic.
"Provost Schlissel has a
really amazing ability to elic-
it different perspectives and
to summarize and build con-
sensus," Glavis-Bloom said. "I
thought Provost Schlissel was a
truly talented leader."
Brown senior Todd Harris,
the president of the Undergradu-
ate Council of Students, also had
positive experiences working
with Schlissel. Like the others,
he said the president-elect works
directly with students and the
student government at Brown,
giving him firsthand insight into
the needs of students. Accord-
ing to Harris, this tendency to
work intimately with students
has garnered him respect across
campus.
He added that Schlissel's
background in science will give
him an edge at the University.
"Provost Schlissel has always
had an interest in Brown as
a research institution, and I-
believe he'll do a great job as the
president of a research universi-
ty," Harris said.

ire of the University

I was overwhelmed by the outpouring of interest, enthusiasm and excitement.
It told me something kind of interesting about the way that the University
community feels about the University. When I stand up and say hello for the
very first time and I get an enormous round of applause (and) people don't
really know me, I'm not foolish enough to think they're applauding for me -
what they're applauding for is their university. In effect, the next president
becomes the face of the university, and I interpreted the enthusiastic welcome I
got as emblematic of the way people feel about their university.

"It felt right. It felt like the beginnings of a conversation. I just had a very
comfortable sense. I felt like I fit at the University of Michigan and that I'm on
the same wavelength."

his supportfor Schlissel.
"President Coleman has been

pattern of Michigan Athletics -
loves and respects the role it plays
on campus," Brandon said. "And
I'm sure the new president will
have the same point of view. And
that's what I heard in his remarks
today at the press conference."
Brandon added that he looks
forward to meeting and working
with Schlissel in the future.
In the press conference, the
president-elect said the Athletic
Department maintains a strong
reputation for the University.
"It's important that our sports
programs operate at the highest
level of integrity," he said. "And
that we practice in public the
greatest level of sportsmanship to
serve as a role model."
The biggest difference between
the Brown and Michigan athletic
departments for Schlissel might
not be the budget or the number
of programs to monitor. Perhaps
it's the number of people Michi-
gan Stadium can hold - 90,000
more fans than Brown Stadium
currently seats.
And it's the atmosphere, the
one that shuts down campus on
Saturdays or keeps students out in
the cold waiting to fill the Crisler
Center that Schlissel has come to
embrace early in his transition to
Michigan.
"I think the great thing about
intercollegiate athletics at a place
like the University of Michigan
is that it's part of the culture; it
brings the community togeth-
er," Schlissel said. "It's the band,
it's the Saturdays in the stadium,
it's the feeling the vibration in
the stands at a basketball game. I
think it's a big piece of the institu-
tional culture."

Campaign to continue
under Schuissel's gaze

Letting voices be heard
The president is ultimately responsible for
important institution-level decisions that take
place both in response to activism and otherwise.
I don't think it's the responsibility of the president
to immediately meet with every group that's upset
about something. But I think it is the responsibility
of the president to make sure that every group
that has concerns that should be known by the
administration of the University, has a pathway to
make those concerns known. A lot of what I want
to do is listen in the first months of my presidency
but also on an ongoing basis. I want to find ways
not just to engage with students bringing forth an
advocacy position, but also more generally with
students regarding their experience and their take
on the environment of the University overall.

After trenendous
start, $4B goal to

new leadership
By YARDAINAMRON and
CLAIRE BRYAN
Daily StaffReporters
When he arrives on campus in
July, University President-elect
Mark Schlissel will undertake
the remainder of the Universi-
ty's $4 billion Victors for Michi-
gan fundraising campaign - the
largest such effort in the history
of public higher education.
For the past two months, Jerry
May, vice president for develop-
ment, and his team have been
preparing a plan to maintain
University President Mary Sue
Coleman's relationships with
important donors once Schlissel
takes over.
"We have a national plan
to take him to different cities
and different groups of donors
around the country," May said
in an interview Friday morning.
"We've set this up for a seamless

transition from one president to
the other."
Over the next year, May has
planned meetings with Schlissel
and key donors around the coun-
try to ease the presidential transi-
tion process.

immense experience with fund-
raising in his current position as
Brown University provost, May
said he has experience from his
time as dean of biological scienc-
es at the University of California,
Berkeley.
When Schlissel takes office,
May said the campaign will have
already collected roughly $2 bil-
lion - about 50 percent of the
campaign's goal.
"The most important thing is
that a president has is vision and
a willingness to listen," May said.
"Those are the two qualities he is
going to do great at as we move
ahead."
At a press conference in the
MichiganUnionFridaymorning,
Schlissel said he understands
the importance of fundraising at
a public institution like the Uni-
versity, and is grateful for his
predecessor's skill with donors.

"To be honest, I'm very privi-
leged because President Coleman
has established relationships and
a culture where successful alum-
ni feel part of the institution and
they want to help," Schlissel said.
"I feel that my job is transferring
to them the excitement of our
mission and helping figure out
how to take the kinds of things
they're interested in and match
them to the great things we want
to do."
In his address, Schlissel also
praised the University's commit-
ment to affordability, noting the
campaign's $1 billion goal for stu-
dent support.
May said Schlissel has already
shownhe has what it takes to lead
the remaining phase of the cam-
paign.
"He is going to come in and
listen to them and inspire them
and show them things that are
important for the rest of this
campaign and for this universi-
ty," May said. "Like Mary Sue,
he has the qualities of being able
to listen, he has the qualities of
being able to tell a great story, I
could just see it today."

New leaders to reshape

departures to affect
University and city
WILL GREENBERG
DailyStaffReporter
After over a decade of unwav-
ering leadership, the city of
Ann Arbor starts the process of
replacing the two most impor-
tant figures in the city.
Ann Arbor City Council mem-
bers and mayoral candidates are
reluctant to pass judgment too
quickly on University President-
Elect Mark Schlissel, but sev-
eral said they are ready for some
changes to the University.
Schlissel is currently the pro-
vost of Brown University, a posi-
tion he has held since 2011, and
will replace University President
Mary Sue Coleman who has been
in office since 2002.
The new appointment comes
during the final in office year for
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieftje -
who opted not to run for another
term after 13 years in office -
creating an opportunity for sig-
nificant leadership and policy
changes at the University and in
Ann Arbor simultaneously.
While the University pro-
vides Ann Arbor with much of
its unique qualities - and serves
as ones of its biggest economic
engines - cooperation between
the school and city has, at times,
been strained. The University
and city have gone head-to-head
manytimes in the past, primarily
over issues of land acquisitions,
development and voluntary pay-
ments in lieu of taxes. The Uni-
versity is currently a tax-free
entity, and has grown, the land
available for property taxes in
Ann Arbor has shrunk - squeez-
ing the city's budget.
Although most of the mayoral

candidates arermostly unfamiliar
with Schlissel, the candidates
agreed on the importance of a
strong relationship between the
mayor and any University presi-
dent.
"Our community is a sym-
biotic relationship of trust and
respect," said Councilmember
Stephen Kunselman (D-Ward
3), one of the four mayoral candi-
dates. "I'm hopeful that we will
see that relationship continue. I
do believe we've always had that
but I think it did get strained, it
gets strained when the commu-
nity feels that the University is
buying up the city."
This pastweek, the City Coun-
cil approved a $25,550 contract
with Atwell, LLC to conduct
Environmental Site Assessment
services for the Edwards Broth-
ers Malloy facility on State Street
to determine if the city will pur-
chase the property or not. The
University has also expressed a
keen interest in purchasing the
property. Though the Univer-
sity has not laid out any specific
plans for the location, the prop-
erty is close to athletic facilities
and could be used for additional
athletic buildings or office space.
The Edwards Brothers prop-
erty case serves as an example of
many land disputes between the
city and the University, wherein
city officials are concerned with
tax revenue lost from a potential
private owner - taxes the Uni-
versity is not required to pay.
Councilmember Sabra Bri-
ere (D-Ward 1), another candi-
date for mayor, said she hopes
communication between the
two institutions will continue
to move forward and give Uni-
versity administration a better
understanding of Ann Arbor's
needs. She added that she and
other city officials do appreciate
the human capital and resources
the University provides, but that

the administration often over-
looks the extra financial burdens
imposed on Ann Arbor citizens
and taxpayers.
"I don't see the money they
give the city to pay their debts as
discussion points when it comes
to the cost the University brings
along with it," Briere said. "I
would love to see that instead
of playing semantic games with
each other we acknowledge that
the University of Michigan ben-
efits the city in intangible ways."
There has been discussion
among council members regard-
ing the possibility of working
with the University to implement
payment in lieu of taxes (PILOT),
a program where already public
entities, like universities, provide
money to the their host towns
despite not having any legal obli-
gation to do so.
Under Coleman's leadership,
the University has not shown any
interest in engaging in PILOT or
other such programs. That may
change under Schlissel.
During Schlissel's time at
Brown, the private school has
donated additional money to
Providence, Rhode Island on
top of tax payments. As provost,
Schlissel agreed to contribute
roughly $3.9 million to the strug-
gling town as part of an agree-
ment with other organizations in
the area, the Brown Daily Herald
reported.
Still, there is no way to know
exactly how this new president
will work with the city and the
new mayor, whoever it may be.
Briere said the councilmem-
bers won't have a real reaction
until Schlissel is in office, saying
she's being careful not to make
assumptions too early.
"The president and the regents
set the tone for the relationship
with the city," Briere said. "I'm
willing to wait and see how the
tone changes."

Top administrators
met with BSU reps.
Friday afternoon
By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffReporter
The University will allocate
$300,000 for renovations to the
Trotter Multicultural Center,
according to the University's Black
Student Union representatives.
Members of the University's
administration and the BSU met on
Friday for the first time.
In an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily, LSA senior Tyrell Col-
lier, BSU speaker, said there is no
time frame on the building's reno-
vations yet. The University is cur-
rently evaluating costs and designs,
but will identify a committee of
students to contribute to the reno-
vation process.
"I can say that was a satisfying
conclusion for the Multicultural
Center demand because I know
a building cannot be built within
the span of a year or something, I
know it needs to be planned out,
designed, all of that stuff," Collier
said. "I was at least very pleased
with the allocation of that money
for the renovations while they fig-
ure out the new building."
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the meeting was
prompted by the seven demands
and Monday deadline announced
publicly last week by the BSU at a

protest held Jan.20.
Elizabeth Barry, special coun-
sel to the president; E. Royster
Harper, vice president for student
life; Dean of Students Laura Blake
Jones and Provost Martha Pollack
represented the administration
at the meeting. Three members of
the University's Board of Regents,
Shauna Ryder Diggs (D), Denise
Ilitch (D) and AndreaFischer New-
man (R), also attended the meeting
in an observatory capacity.
Since the BSU's viral Twit-
ter campaign using #BBUM - or
Being Black at Michigan - Pollack
issued an e-mail promising change
in the campus' diversity climate
with a list of several priorities to be
implemented by the University.
However, the BSU subsequently
protested in a Martin Luther King,
Jr. Day demonstration, where they
released a list of seven demands
and a deadline of one week for the
University to address them.
The demands included renova-
tions and a more central location
for the Trotter Center, increased
minority enrollment and lower-
cost housing on Central Campus,
among other initiatives.
All seven demands issued Mon-
day were discussed during the
meeting, according to BSU execu-
tives. BSU members said they will
continue to meet with the same
administrators once a week for sta-
tus updates on each initiative.
Pollack's Jan. 16 e-mail
addressed to students restated the
campus need to advance the cam-

pus climate of diversity and inclu-
sion. In the letter, she pledged to
improve the Trotter Center in the
short-term and, in the long run,
investigate how to relocate it. A
renovation plan will be completed
by the end of the term.
"We will start abroad conversa-
tionwith students, staff and faculty
to capture their best thinking as
we collectively reimagine a future
multicultural center," Pollack
wrote.
Fitzgerald, who was not at the
meeting but spoke afterward with
several administrators who were,
said administrators felt the discus-
sion was a positive experience.
"(E.) Royster Harper certainly
characterized it as a very good
meeting, with a much deeper
understanding of the concerns
raised by the Black Student Union,"
Fitzgerald said. "Her characteriza-
tion of it was that everyone was
very prepared; it was a very posi-
tive meeting."
The BSU reacted similarly in a
short statement released via Twit-
ter on Friday evening.
"The Black Student Union
looks forward to negotiating with
University Officials in the com-
ing weeks, and is optimistic about
working with the University to
create sustainable and positive
change," the statement said.
With more meetings planned
for the future, the two groups aim
to establish a standing meeting
arrangement, the BSU representa-
tives and Fitzgerald both said.

CSG collaborates for
entrepeneurship launch

Academic minor to
pull from diverse
University units
By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
Deputy Magazine Editor
More than 60 student leaders
and members of the University's
entrepreneurial community
gathered in the Anderson Room
of the Michigan Union to kick-
start the creation of a new
academic program in entrepre-
neurship. Representing a diverse
selection of schools and colleges,
the attendees discussed ways a
new program could best benefit
the campus community.
In early December, Central
Student Government President
Michael Proppe and Vice Presi-
dent Bobby Dishell, a Public Pol-
icy junior, announced their plans
to create a minor in entrepreneur-
ship. While the announcement
did not outline the structure of
the program, it suggested that
the new program would be more
expansive than the nine-credit
Program in Entrepreneurship
currently offered.
"This is something that CSG
is really excited about," Proppe
said at the meeting. "The entre-
preneurship community really
flourishing on campus and what's
really cool about all this is that
it's all being done by students."
Since the beginning of the
academic year, CSG has been
pushing increased student input
in University administrative
decisions through initiatives

that include working with the
Athletic Department to reframe
the football ticketing policy and
assembling a student presiden-
tial search advisory commit-
tee to help ease the transition of
University President-elect Mark
Schlissel. The new entrepreneur-
ship program would similarly
employ a "by-students, for-stu-
dents" framework, Proppe said.
The new program will be orga-
nized under the leadership of
Thomas Zurbuchen, senior coun-
selor to the provost for entrepre-
neurial education, who has been
heavily involved with advising
former CSG administrations on
their entrepreneurial ventures.
Zurbuchen said he saw the pro-
gram as prospectively being the
"most important program at the
University."
In his introduction, Zurbu-
chen tackled the stigma that
entrepreneurship was "two guys
in a garage" building a tech com-
pany. Instead, he said the new
program would help the Univer-
sity create an "Entrepreneurship
2.0," where students would be
able to not only create compa-
nies, but also tackle some of the
most important challenges in
life.
Throughout the program's
development, Zurbuchen encour-
aged students to continually ask
"Why not me?" - the slogan cur-
rently employedby social innova-
tion-based student organization
optiMize.
After a 20-minute introduc-
tion by CSG and Zurbuchen, the
floor was opened up for discus-
sion and the student attendants

discussed the challenges plagu-
ing campus, such as health and
wellness on campus, transporta-
tion, appreciation for the arts and
access to University faculty, as
well as the right way to approach
campus-wide entrepreneurship.
"I think a lot of people get
intimidated because they think
of building the next Facebook or
the next Snapchat," Kinesiology
senior Ricky Fleming said. "But
findingthe next biggest thing can
even be a small improvement."
LSA senior Aditi Shetty said
she believes that a lot of people
have ideas, but are unaware of
how entrepreneurship can help
them.
"I think the language that we
use is really important - how do
we define entrepreneurship and
how do we make it more inclu-
sive?" she said.
over the course of the next few
weeks, Zurbuchen will appoint a
group of student advisers from
those who were present at the
event to serve as a "think tank"
to help create the new program.
"I want to build a programthat
is the most needed and is one that
can really have the most impact
on the world," he said. "For me,
building this program is an entre-
preneurship problem in itself."
Zurbuchen added that he has a
clear goal, regardless of the shape
that the program ends up taking.
"Entrepreneurship is very
much linked to what you need
to take home today and what I
hope will be the key word that
will define Michigan entrepre-
neurship - action. We want to
empower you to act."

such as Ford, reverse innova-
tion represents a new phenom-
enon. Most companies have yet
to develop a strategy that incor-
porates it into their business
model.
"Companies don't have a
reverse innovation strategy
because it takes a different way
of looking at the business that
traditionally companies don't
do," Adriaens said.
Companies are now actively
seeking the factors that will
result in reverse innovation, but
there are no clear answers.
"The big problem with reverse

In many ways, American com-

"China has used reverse inno-

Adriaens said.
Zielinski said the future of
transportation might be based
on interconnectivity between
different forms of new mobility.
She added that China is develop-

"Information technology

'U' research cluster gets
low rank i n produci ng
start-ups, patented tech

Research alliance
noted for talent
production,
research spending
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Deputy Magazine Editor
With recent entrepreneur-
ship-focused events like the
startup career fair and MHacks
fresh in the minds of many stu-
dents, it might seem that stu-
dent-created tech and business
ventures are everywhere at the
University.
But a recent report conducted
by East Lansing-based Ander-
son Economic Group found that
the University Research Corri-
dor, a research alliance between
the University, Michigan State
University and Wayne State
University, may need to place
more emphasis on entrepre-
neurship for the URC to remain
competitive with the seven
other major university research
clusters ranked in the study.
According to the study,
which was conducted over a
five-year period that ended in
2012, though the URC granted
more degrees than any of the
other clusters, it placed last in
tech transfer and next-to-last in
launching startups. The Univer-
sity was responsible for 11 of the
14 startups created in the URC
during the study's five-year
period, while MSU was respon-
sible for the other three.
However, the URC had a
strong showing in other catego-
ries against the other clusters,
which included North Caro-
lina's Research Triangle Park,
California's two Innovation
Hubs and Massachusetts' Route
128 Corridor. In fact, the URC
placed first in talent produc-
tion and fourth in research and
development spending.
What the University may lack
in startup quantity, it makes up
for in quality, according Tom
Frank, the executive director
of the University's Center for
COST
From Page 2A
of the Board of Regents, said the
search was more intense and more
involved than any of the previous
two presidential searches that she
participated in.
However, she said this was the
first search in which the regents
were involved in the entirety ofthe
search, rather than simply voting
from a selection of finalists pre-
sented bythe search committee.
Since the regents decided to
participate in the whole search
process this time around, Newman
said the search committee was
confined to faculty to prevent the
group from becomingtoo large.
Multiple forums were held in
September and October and many
students and faculty spoke before
members of the search committee
aboutwhattheyhoped to see inthe
next president.
LSA freshman Benjamin Cher
spoke at the Sept. 27 forum about
the need for a new president to

Entrepreneurship. He added
that when it comes to talent, the
University can't be beat.
Frank cited Rapt.fm, which
encourages freestyle rap and
one-on-one rap battles with
people from all over the world,
and A2B Bike Share as examples
of the high-caliber startups cre-
ated by University students.
"One of the reasons I came
here from California is because
I've never seen this confluence
of factors that make Michigan
feel like it's just ripped wide-
open in terms of output of scal-
able, viable businesses," Frank
said of the combination of
resources available and student
talent.
The startups indicative of the
success of the creators, in addi-
tion to employing other students
and picking up venture capital
and other external funding.
These factors, combined with
the "cutting edge" programs
being developed by administra-
tors, indicate that University
students will continue to be at
the top of the business heap,
according to Frank.
"Long-term viability is ulti-
mately what's going to add the
greatest value to the Michi-
gan ecosystem and create
jobs here and sustainability,"
Frank said. "It's not always
important to say I had 25 con-
testants that entered the mar-
athon; I'd like to have the top
five finishers."
Ken Nisbet, associate vice
president for research at the
University's Technology Trans-
fer Office, said the URC report
was less indicative of the Uni-
versity's overall standing than
it was of the need to continue to
improve resources in the state of
Michigan.
While the University receives
the most research funding of
any institution in the state, part
of the URC mission is to engen-
der communication between the
three coordinating units and
to share the best practices and
talent resources to improve the
economy in the region.
allocate resources to various
departments more efficiently,
though he said he was appreciative
of the opportunitygiven to him.
"There were some speakers
at the forum who went up to the
microphone and said 'I do not
wish to thank you for the right to
speak because I know I have the
right to speak and I should expect
this' - and I think that's the wrong
attitude," Cher said in a Friday
interview. "I am grateful for the
fact that this exists and that some-
one like me is able to express their
opinion."
Without a student on the search
committee, CSG posed a six-ques-
tion survey to students in mid-
September to garner a sense of
what students hoped to see in the
president.
"We might have incidentally set
a new precedent throughout presi-
dential searches," Proppe said.
"We were able to collect feedback
from hundreds of students, actual-
ly about a thousand students about
what the students wanted in the
next president."

"We have a number of suc-
cess stories out of the University
of Michigan startups that are
known nationally," Nisbet said.
"We are definitely not under-
performing relative to those
other states."
According to a 2013 survey,
URC alumni "had started or
acquired businesses at double
the national average rate among
college graduates since 1996 and
were 1.5 times as successful as
the average U.S. business owner
at keeping those startups and
acquisitions alive in the previ-
ous five years."
Still, there's room for
improvement. Engineering
junior Christopher O'Neil, pres-
ident of MPowered - a student
organization that fosters entre-
preneurship within the campus
community - said the Univer-
sity could work on increasing
its interdisciplinary approach
to startup creation in order to
maximize student potential.
O'Neil said it would be ben-
eficial if the University offered
more project-based undergrad-
uate classes that mix Business,
Engineering and Art & Design
students who are all focused on
creating something together.
"One of the problems with
Michigan is that it's super
decentralized," O'Neil said. "I
think it'd be a lot easier for peo-
ple to start companies if they
didn't have to go search for the
designer, search for the engi-
neer, search for the business
student."
He added that the University
is on an "upward slope of entre-
preneurship," and will continue
to improve its resources and
programs for students interest-
ed in starting their own compa-
nies.
O'Neil said the best is yet to
come from University students.
"Even in the time I've been
here, I can say 100-percent that
the culture and mindset has
changed at this University. The
mindset is there. Now we just
need to churn out some better
startups."
In an interview Sunday, Schlis-
sel outlined the chronology of
the search process, which for
him began in October and lasted
through much of the fall.
Schlissel first met the search
committee in New York City,
where he sat at the head of a long
wooden table and answered ques-
tions from the regents and com-
mittee members.
"After a few minutes, it stopped
being an interview and felt like a
conversation between colleagues,"
Schlissel said.
The second meeting also
occurred in New York City, where
Schlissel met with small sub-
groups of search committee mem-
bers.
After the second interview,
Schlissel made his first visit to Ann
Arbor in late November where he
toured campus before having din-
ner that evening at Regent Denise
Ilitch's home.
"It was very conversational.
They were probing the way I
thought about various issues,"
Schlissel said.

However, some council
members doubt the possibility
of a PILOT program ever being
instituted.
City Councilmember Sally
Hart Petersen (D-Ward 2) said
the program is not practical.
"In order for the University
and the city to work collabora-

wanting to act in a way that
- to some city council mem-
bers - is responsible demon-
strates a lack of concern for
the University," Petersen said.
"However, both city and Uni-
versity officials have said that
they share similar interests in
the city."
Michigan State University
has an agreement with the city
of East Lansing that does not
include any form of reimburse-
ment of taxes, and at this time
a PILOT program is not under
consideration.
However, Yale University
recently increased its PILOT
payments to the city of New
Haven from $1.2 million to $7.5
million.
A study by the Lincoln Insti-
tute of Land Policy found that
though such programs can
provide much-needed revenue
for cities and towns, the down-
sides are also numerous.
"PILOTs can provide crucial
revenue for certain munici-
palities, and are one way to
make nonprofits pay for the
public services they consume,"
the report stated. "However,
PILOTs are often haphazard,
secretive, and calculated in
an ad hoc manner that results
in widely varying payments
among similar nonprofits.
In addition, a municipality's
attempt to collect PILOTs can
prompt a battle with nonprof-
its and lead to years of conten-
tious, costly and unproductive
litigation."

MUSIC Matters revamps
end-of-year concert to
include more student orgs.

Besides headline
artists, SpringFest
to expand reach
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
MUSIC Matters' year-end
SpringFest event began as an
annual celebration capped by
a concert featuring a headlin-
ing artist. At its inception, the
money it raised would go to a
charity, set to change each year.
After two years, the student
organization is expanding its
vision. In November, the group
unveiled its $50,000-endowed
"Big Thinkers" scholarship, the
first student-funded endeavor
of its kind at the University.
Now, MUSIC Matters is
revamping SpringFest to
resemble South by Southwest,
a nine-day spring festival in
Austin, Texas that is a hub for
music, film and technology.
SpringFest will occur on
either April 10 or 17, LSA senior
Phillip Schermer, president of
MUSIC Matters, said.
On Sunday, leaders from
MUSIC Matters pitched Spring-
Fest's new structure to student
organizations potentially inter-
ested in being involved in its set
up.
"At the end of the day,
MUSIC Matters is coordinat-
ing this event, but it's really
supposed to be by the commu-
nity and for the community,"
Schermer said.
The new SpringFest may
expand to envelop a large
portion of Central Campus.

The tentative structure fea-
tures what Schermer calls the
"globe," an open area and stage
featuring food and speakers
throughout the day.
Sprouting from the globe
will be spaces organized by five
themes: arts, identity, innova-
tion, social justice and sus-
tainability. Organizations will
display their year's work within
the corresponding theme.
Schermer said he wants the
event to showcase students'
accomplishments.
To provide examples of what
the typical organization will do
to exhibit its work, SpringFest's
anchor groups - optiMize,
MPowered, Michigan Sports
Business Conference, the
National Pan-Hellenic Council
and Ask Big Questions - pre-
sented their plans.
Representatives from opti-
Mize, a student organization
centered on entrepreneurial
social service, expressed their
hope to partner with student
artists and create artistic social
commentary relating to the
group's work.
Students from MPowered
said they want to host profes-
sionals to judge student start-
ups and integrate them into the
marketplace.
Kinesiology senior Jared
Hunter, president of Michigan's
National Pan-Hellenic Council,
said SpringFest could facilitate
a stepping contest between fra-
ternities and sororities judged
by administrators. Each of the
NPHC's organizations has an
auxiliary youth chapter, allow-
ing area high school students to
attend SpringFest.

This concept aligns with
MUSIC Matter's partner-
ship with the Office of Admis-
sions, which sees SpringFest
as an opportunity to show-
case the University. Business
junior Nick Moeller, chair of
the SpringFest Committee for
MUSIC Matters, said the Uni-
versity's and MUSIC Matter's
goals are aligned.
"A big part of what we stand
for as an organization is bring-
ing Michigan students togeth-
er," he said. "SpringFest is
something that you don't see
on other campuses, and the
idea (was) that the University
might be able to promote that
as, 'Look at what you can do at
the University of Michigan. If
you're a part of any organiza-
tion from any background, you
can come be celebrated and we
can showcase the work you can
do."'
LSA senior JoHanna Roth-
seid, president of Ask Big Ques-
tions, hopes her organization
will kindle this kind of inter-
mingling. The organization
intends to place whiteboards
between each section of stu-
dent organizations at Spring-
Fest - where facilitators can
foster conversation and written
responses related to the specific
section's theme.
"We spend so much time
going to this University and
getting so involved and invest-
ed in our extracurriculars,"
Rothseid said, adding that the
whiteboards would allow space
for conversation that address-
es the "awesome and incred-
ible things" students are doing
across numerous fields.

'Palestine Interrupted'
to reveal hidden stories

"Well according to this edition of the Michigan Daily..."

By ANNA SADOVSKAYA
Daily Arts Writer
Shrouded in conflict, popu-
lar perceptions of Palestinians
are often clouded by war, and

ing search Palestine

tion. New Interrupted
York artist Through Feb.14
Adam Abel
challenges Exhibit Reception
the endless with artist's talk:
battle-tinged Jan.28,5:40 pm
narratives
coming from
the West Bank and seeks to show
a different version of Palestine
- an interruption from the bar-
rage of news stories depicting
fighting. This is told through his
piece, "Palestine Interrupted,"
a work geared toward the softer
side of the small sliver of land on
the banks of the Jordan River.
"Palestine is something that
I feel very close to," Abel said. "I
come from a Jewish family, and
I come from Philadelphia, and so
that also has made me very much
connected to what's going on in
Palestine and with 'my people.'
I ended up marrying an Arab-
American playwright from Leba-
non."
The interest in Palestine was
piqued during his time at Parsons
The New School For Design, when
hebeganvisitingthe state and met
a Palestinian activist who became
his partner for "QALQILYA," a
documentary that explores the
difficulty in telling a Palestinian
story to a Western audience.
"In the beginning, it's inescap-
able to notice the checkpoints
and the walls and surveillance
and the Israeli military vehicles.
There's too many of them," Abel

said of his trips to Palestine. "I
thought of all of these as the bar-
riers; after spending so much time
working onthis project, I realized
that a bigger wall was that nar-
ratives just can't leave Palestine.
The people can't tell their own
stories."
To combat this, Abel focused
on telling the other story - the
one of kids beat-boxing, of skate-
boarders and rollerbladers - of
times outside of strife. Abel began
"Palestine Interrupted" by imag-
ining a physical space that could
best showcase the different nar-
ratives.
"This circle idea is how it start-
ed," Abel said. "It's about process,
and life is about thinking about a
way of what needs to get done. I
started looking at all my footage
and picking out these moments
that weren't necessarily going
to be part of the film, but that
I would use near the end, that
I think served to convey ideas
about emotion."
Originally, Abel envisioned a
perfect circle of nine monitors,
each showing a clip on repeat.
Swivel stools would be at the cen-
ter, and each person would turn
from one monitor to the next. But
because different exhibit areas
call for different installation tech-
niques, Abel wanted to tell the
story of movement beyond bor-
ders - for his work to go beyond
the installation.
"I approached it from a central
place, with the idea of the circle
engaging with movement and, not
incidentally ... the story is about a
bunch of kids who use movement
to break barriers of confinement,"
Abel said. "So I was really inter-
ested in kind of taking that idea
into the spaces the film was going
to be featured in, with the narra-

tives and the expression of move-
ment."
Rather than tell one story,
Abel's nine clips tell the story of
routine, mundane, typical occur-
rences for the Palestinian people,
without focusing on the political
and military conflict.
"There's a piece about olives,
and it's a story of an olive becom-
ing olive oil. Then there's a goat
that becomes a holiday meal; You
see the goat alive and then you see
the goat dead, chopped to pieces,"
Abel said. "Then there's a narra-
tive about some sort of object in a
bag, and the video is shot inside of
the bag, and it's gone through the
process of inspection."
Focusing on real
portrayals of
Palestinian life.
More interested in what's not
shown than what is, Abel delib-
erately leaves out the war-torn
shots, in order to bring to life
something he hopes to be more
meaningful.
"I would like everyone to expe-
rience something; maybe some-
thing that they hadn't before or
find out something they didn't
know," Abel said. "I would be
interested in knowing how a
viewer engages with their own
understanding of Palestine
through the experience of see-
ing the work. I don't want them
to think a certain way or direct
them. I'm just interested in how
they engage with their own
understanding."

'Invisible Woman

A passionate true
story from the
life of Dickens
By CARLY KEYES
DailyArts Writer
Though celebrated for his gift

sured fiction B
- Charles The Invisible
Dickens's
most pas- Woman
sionate tale Michigan
happens to Theater
be a true
one, and it Sony Pictures
unfolded far
away from
the paper his masterful pen had
so passionately tread upon.
Based on a book of the same
name by Claire Tomalin, "The
Invisible Woman" stars Ralph
Fiennes ("Skyfall") as the
worshipped writer who, long
troubled by a lackluster mar-
riage, pursues a fiery, forbid-
den relationship with a young
actress and devoted admirer of

his work, Ellen "Nelly" Ternan
(Felicity Jones, "Breathe In"),
despite the strong warning of
her caring mother, Frances
(Kristin Scott Thomas, "Before
the Winter Chill").
Fiennes, who also directed
the film, unravels the narra-
tive with heavy helpings of
flashback as real-time Nelly
- who works at a prep school
for young boys and leads the
charge as they prepare a pro-
duction of one of Dickens's
plays - reflects upon her roll-
ercoaster romance with her lit-
erary idol.
While Fiennes and Jones
offer convincing chemistry as
a covert couple, it's a painfully
predictable and played-out plot
from writer Abi Morgan ("The
Iron Lady"), and it grows dif-
ficult to root for a relationship
that is so clearly and firmly
rooted in narcissism: A celebri-
ty novelist trapped in a sexless
marriage with an overweight
spouse jumps at the slightest
attention from a bright, beauti-
ful, blonde 18-year old who can
recite every line of his prose
from memory? It's an obvious
response to a primal scenar-
io, and the only intrigue here

derives from whatever high one
might typically get from wit-
nessing budding scandal and
infidelity progress into an all
out torrid affair.
Although the film lacks
structure and disappoints with
its dialogue, it succeeds sub-
stantially with its decorative
characteristics. The vintage
(and Oscar-nominated) cos-
tume design dazzles, the art
direction delicately impresses
and the inventive, chiaroscuro-
laden cinematography captures
the essence of contradicted
lovers: a man torn between his
life in the limelight and the one
he keeps in the dark with his
secret lover, and she, a woman
who overtly reveres the author
yet never entirely divulges the
true extent of this avid devo-
tion.
Ultimately, "The Invis-
ible Woman" is a narratively
all-too-familiar - yet visu-
ally refreshing - based on real
events biopic that manifests
one of Dickens's most-coined
phrases from "A Tale of Two
Cities": "A wonderful fact to

longer thanks to Write A House,
a non-profit that renovates aban-
doned houses and gives them to
writers, creating a writing com-
munity and providing an invalu-
able resource for up and coming
artists: a home.
"In a lot of ways, writers are
suffering just as much as Detroit
is," said Toby Barlow, a founding
board member. "Detroit has been
the poster child for industrial
decline and writers have been
having a pretty hard time of it,
too. It seemed like a great idea to
combine the two."
Write A House's mission state-
ment is to enliven the literary arts
in Detroit by renovating vacant
homes and giving them to -jour-
nalists, authors, poets and more.
Consider it a writer's residency
program, however the residency
lasts forever, creating a writer's
colony and revitalizing Detroit
areas through the arts. The proj-
ect doesn't only benefit the writ-
ers and the houses; it gives an
opportunity to neighborhood
youth to learn carpentry and
building skills through its part-
nership with non-profit Young
Detroit Builders.
Barlow has worked in advertis-
ing around the country, and land-
edinDetroittoworkonrebuilding
Ford's image about seven years
ago. Recently, he joined forces
with Sarah Cox, the editorial
director of the Detroit real estate
website, Curbed, to start Write

A House. Write A House bought
houses near to neighboring Power
House Productions, another arts-
based community project. Write
A House differs from PHP in
its specific emphasis on written
work as opposed to visual arts.
"We were aware that music
and visual arts groups in the city
are doing well," Write A House
board member Anna Clark said.
"But the literary group is a bit
stifled."
Clark, a University of Michi-
gan alum, moved to Detroit in
2007. As a freelance journalist,
she has published pieceswith The
Guardian, The Nation, NBC News
and more. She got her start as a
Michigan Daily reporter covering
the University's administration,
and like many students in Ann
Arbor, had only visited Detroit for
sporting events. A few years after
moving to the city, she founded
Literary Detroit, a reader-centric
program that brings attention to
or creates events to draw inter-
est to literacy in Detroit. She also
serves as a writer in residence at
Detroit High Schools through the
InsideOut Literary Arts Project.
When conversations about Write
A House began, Clark was on
board.
"You couldn't logistically do
this anywhere else," Clark said.
"I've only been here for six years,
and it's amazing to see how the
energy has changed over time. It's
a place where the creative com-
munity is very engaged, and writ-
ers want to be around that strong
creative force."
Many other cities, as Clark
points out, are too expensive for
writers to truly be able to concen-
trate on their work, and not only
that - most cities don't have the
attitude of Detroit, nor the inspi-
rational creative community.
"We think it's a really positive
project," Barlow said. "On the
one hand, you're helping the indi-
vidual writer, and in agreaterway
you're bringing a lot of attention
to Detroit as a place that supports
creativity and the arts."

But who are the writers that
receive one of these free and newly
renovated homes? The answer is
quite simple - any kind of writer,
from a poet to a journalist and
anywhere in between. Skill is
prized over experience and will-
ingness to engage ina community
of writers and the greater Detroit
community at large is important
for the unification goals of Write
A House.
"When we got the other two
houses we got them in the same
vicinity, to help build a commu-
nityfeeling," Clark said. "Wewant
people to have healthy relation-
ships with the people they live
around. People want neighbors,
they don't want to live next to
vacant houses. And at this point,
there is room for all."

TV REVIEW
HBO soars again with 'Looking'

ByEMILYBODDEN

HBO has another hit on its
hands. "Looking," a series revolv-
ing around a group of mostly gay
friends living in San Francisco,
premiered on
Sunday to much A
acclaim. Over

running time, 10:30 p.m.
the show man- HID
aged to generate
a strong con-
nection to its
characters, that puts the program
on a strong footing for the future.
"Looking"'s premiere was suc-
cessful because, while managing
to introduce characters and their
pasts, it did not linger on them.
Instead, there was an ingrained
familiarity that made viewers
feel as if they have known the
characters for years. With a
combination of lighting, camera
work and dialogue, "Looking"
produced one of the most hon-
est portrayals of friendship cur-
rently on TV.
Throughout the premiere, the
producers utilized tight fram-
ing, creating an intimacy that is
not always sought after but also
works sowell within the context
of the show. The subtle shift-
ing focus that draws viewers'
eyes naturally from character
to character complemented the
tight framing beautifully. Addi-
tionally, the lighting is soft and
warm which plays into creating
a sense of closeness.

who is reminiscent of at least
one of your friends.
The dialogue can stand alone.
While not as quotable as HBO's
other hit, "Girls," the dialogue is
honest, never coming off as con-
trived. The chemistry between
the cast breathes life into the
dialogue which could easily be
boring if all the other elements
on the show were not so com-
plimentary. As English teachers
everywhere preach, the dialogue
"shows not tells." And by that,
the intricacies of each charac-
ter's personality shine through
to meld with the carefully con-

structed production choices.
"Looking" also uses social
media in a very appropriate
way. Instead of shying away
from mentioning social media,
they embrace it without worry
of seeming outdated. The refer-
ences to Instagram filters ruin-
ing everything ("Is this guy
even hot?") to the proper use of
emojis ("A winking smiley face
- what are you, a Japanese teen-
ager?") are dead on. This genera-
tion is intertwined with the rise
of the Internet and it is great to
see a TV show so unabashedly
use that fact to further plot and
character development.

University President Mary Sue Coleman looks on as President-elect Mark Schlissel delivers his first speech to the University in the Michigan Union Friday.

University President Mary Sue
Coleman didn't become one of
Time Magazine's 10 best college
presidents overnight.
When Coleman arrived inAnn
Arbor, she faced many hurdles,
as will the University president-
elect Mark Schlissel when he
assumes office this summer.
In her March 2003 inaugura-
tion speech, Coleman addressed
the pending lawsuits against the
University, Gratz v. Bollinger
and Grutter v. Bollinger, cases
that challenged the University's
admissions policies and made
their way to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
That fall, Coleman had to
remain vocal about the Universi-
ty's vision for diversity and affir-
mative action. Coleman also had
to define herself as a prominent
leader, as the first female presi-
dent of the University and one
of only a few females at the time
leading the nation's most presti-
gious universities.
During the reception -'after
her speech, The MichiganDaily
reported Coleman instantlycon-
nected with professors, alumni
and students. People commented
onhowwelcomingand approach-
able Coleman was with everyone
she met.
"She has that personal, direct
feeling for people," former Busi-
ness Prof. Jim Holmes said in a
2003 interview.
But by the next fall, students
were not as impressed.
In a September 2003 edito-
rial, The Daily's editorial staff
criticized Coleman for making no
effort to be active among student
groups, failing to fill key admin-
istrative posts and lacking any
clear ideas for the future of the
University.
"(Coleman) has thus far
been unsuccessful in enhanc-
ing the University's intellec-
tual atmosphere," the editorial
read. "Coleman seems intent on
avoiding controversy that would
challenge both faculty and stu-
dents."
When former University Pres-
ident James Duderstadt entered
his presidency in 1988, he said his
leadership team took pride not
only in keeping the University on
track during the transition, but
also in beginning to make prog-
ress on issues of race relations
and resource allocation.

Wrestling prevails
despite Coon loss

By JUSTIN MEYER
Daily Sports Writer
Adam Coon put the
Michigan wrestling team on
his back time and again this
season, but on Friday it was
his teammates' turn to do the
carrying.
During the Michigan
wrestling team's dismantling
of in-state rival Michigan State
23-6, freshman phenom and

previously undefeated Coon
watched as the ref raised his
opponent's arm in triumph for
the first time.
Coon, the top-ranked NCAA
heavyweight, headed directly
to the locker room without
picking up his head as the
Spartans' ninth-ranked senior
Mike McClure celebrated in a
front of a stunned crowd.
"The first emotion is shock,"
Coon said. "You start to dwell

on 'What did I do wrong?' Now
that I've gotten my head back
together, it's figuring out 'OK,
what did he do to stop this and
what can I do to fix it."'
Four years of collegiate
wrestling separating McClure
and Coon were apparent in
the size difference between
the two wrestlers. Coon's
quickness and technical skill

and as sophomore forward

spent those practices tussling
with each other, or at least
pretending to. They drove each

What do you think of Michigan basketball now?

wo dramas played out
Saturday night, both
varying degrees of
enthralling. There was the
game, of
course, a
meeting
between the
Big Ten's
best, Michi-
gan and
Michigan
State. Then
there was ZACH
the perfor- HELFAND
mance of the
Michigan
men's basketball team's sideline,
which, as time wound down,
boiled into an excited mess each
time play stopped.
The two routines were
wonderfully mismatched,
as if the team was under a
trance, each whistle snapping
the Wolverines from peace
to rage, coolness to madness,
poetry to absurdity, until,
after approximately forever,
the final two minutes of play
ended, at which point all that
gave way to rapture.
Disclaimer: The 80-75
Michigan victory came over a
significantly hobbled Michi-
gan State team. But this was a
deeply satisfying victory for the
Wolverines, the capstone to a
deeply impressive three-game
stretch, and about as fun as reg-
ular-season college basketball
gets. Teams are supposed to
get a chance to breathe during
timeouts. But Michigan was so
wound up it looked more com-
fortable on the floor.
The fervor began with 4:01
remaining in the game. John
Beilein had said on Friday that
he just wanted his players to
keep it close, then maybe they'd
have a chance to steal the game
late. Well, now it was close, and
they had a chance to steal the
game late, and Beilein was yell-
ing like a maniac. Nik Stauskas

the starting lineup by the end of
last year, would probably be the
Big Ten Player of the Year if the
season ended today. Albrecht,
the Justin Bieber lookalike
(who has just four inches on
the 5-foot-7 pop star), always
seems to be at the right place at
the right time and has just one
turnover in Big Ten play.
Beilein's best coaching gift
may be his eye for undervalued
talent and his trust in that
talent. When the players start
to understand what Beilein
saw in them in the first place,
that's when the Wolverines
become dangerous.
Take Derrick Walton Jr.,
the freshman point guard.
Beilein was under pressure to
replace him with Albrecht in
the starting lineup, but Beilein
stayed the course.
So it was fitting that the
dagger came from Walton. With
2:29 remaining, he slashed to
the basket on a fast break, drew
a foul and flicked up a graceful.
spinning finger roll. It stayed
there right above the net for a
moment, bouncing off the front
rim, rolling around to the back,
ricocheting once more between
the front and back...
If Michigan could hold on, it
would mean three straight wins
against top-1O teams. This was
a March-like slate of games,
if slightly out of order. North-
western, Nebraska and Penn

understatement. Once
ranked No. 3 in the nation,
the Wolverines had lost four
straight games and compiled
the program's longest winless
streak since 2011 before

Thursday's matchup in Detroit.
Anything less than a sweep
of the Spartans would've been
devastating. A split would put
Michigan on the wrong side of
the NCAA Tournament bubble.
Two more losses to a rival with
few quality wins would've been
nothingshort of embarrassing.
The week before the series,
sophomore forward Andrew
Copp said the Wolverines were
"confident that we can beat
those guys every night."
But it's one thing to talk
bravado and another to play
with it. For the greater part
of two months, Michigan had
been playing on its heels, and
because of the sparse schedule,
it had little opportunity to
break the freefall.

"We had all this time to think
about our last four games," said
Michigan coach Red Berenson.
Each of those was a loss,
increasingly worrisome results
from a team with Frozen
Four aspirations. Against
the Spartans, the Wolverines
needed a win. They needed a
spark. They needed a goal.

and hulking McClure.
Coon's loss put the heavily
favored 12th-ranked Wolverines
in an uneasy and unusual
position as they headed toward
the lower weight classes tied 6-6
with Michigan State (0-4 Big
Ten, 5-7 overall).
Michigan (4-0 , 8-2) began
the meet by takinga hard fought
6-0 lead. Redshirt junior Collin
Zeerip avoided getting caught
in a takedown late in the match
to hold on to a 3-2 victory at 174
pounds. Afterward, freshman
Domenic Abounader rallied to
win in overtime at 184 pounds.
After the intermission and
Coon's loss, the Wolverines
rebounded with renewed
enthusiasm, highlighted by an
aggressive match from redshirt
freshman Conor Youtsey, who
scored amajor decision.
Fifth year senior Eric Grajales
also had a strong performance,
keeping his opponent fighting
in vain while forced flat against
the mat. Michigan nearly got
the pin before a series of blood
stoppages put an exclamation
mark on a vicious match.
Grajales has recovered to prime
form after a shaky start to the
season, just as the Wolverines
have begun to burn through
their conference competition.
Redshirt junior Steve Dutton
and freshman Brian Murphy
also provided high points for the
Wolverines, but the end to Coon's
undefeated streak still weighed
on the crowd.
The Spartans' 18th-ranked
junior JohnRizqallah dominated
Abounader in the first period of
the day's most exciting match,
but Abounader eventually began
to heed Michigan coach Joe
McFarland's screams to push
the pace.
"In the third period I started
to pick it up and he started to
get worn out," Abounader said.
"Coach was telling me he would
before the match and I've been
working realhard all week trying
to get my conditioning up, and it

definitely paid off."
Abounader reversed the riding
time deficit and nearly rolled the
faltering Rizqallah into anear fall
at the end of the third period to
force a scoreless tie. In overtime,
Abounader came to life, shooting
for takedowns to take control of
the match. The breakthrough
finally came at the end of the
second 30-second tiebreaker
when Abounader scored a
takedown and immediately put
the match out of reach by forcing
a near fall.
"Rizqallah is a tough
84-pounder," McFarland said.
"I got a lot of respect for him.
We could see that it looked like
conditioning was going to be
a factor in the match. The way
that Domenic escaped, and then
scored, and then went right in
for the kill in overtime, that was
great to see."
Coon took the mat with
Michigan leading 6-3, and
a sold-out crowd buzzing in
anticipation of the marquee
matchup. McClure was too
strong for the freshman,
though, and never let Coon get
close.
"We weren't able to clear
our ties and get to our offense,"
McFarland said. "It was a good
lesson for us. (Adam's) not
happy about it, but he'll be back.
We have a lot more wrestling
left this season."
Both wrestlers scored
by escaping from the down
position at the start of the
second and third periods,
and McClure almost scored a
takedown early in the third.
In the closing seconds Coon
began to force the action and
ended up caught in a takedown.
The resulting desperate escape
attempt ended with a near fall
count and a 5-1 loss.
Coon was composed and
reflective after the meet,
explaining that a loss taught a
wrestler more about himself
than a win. For Michigan
wrestling, a rivalry victory
without Coon might have given
them the confidence to take
adversity in stride in a way that
a Coon win never could have.

Mixhigan wrestling coach Joe McFarland has signed some of the top athletes in the state, and high-school dual meets in Ann Arbor have helped his efforts.
Recruits impressed at Cliff Keen

Dual meet helps
Michigan dominate
in-state battles
By BEN FIDELMAN
DailySports Writer
Before the No. 12 Michigan
wrestling team took on
Michigan State on Friday, two
future Wolverines stood on
the mat of Cliff Keen Arena.
St. John's junior Logan Massa
and senior Zac Hall will be
high-ranking members of
their respective Wolverine
recruiting classes, and they
had just finished competing in
a high-school dual meet hosted
by the University.
Hours later, Michigan did
its best to get the block 'M'
emblazoned in the minds of
potential recruits.
"We know it's good for our
program to do these kinds of
things," said Michigan coach
Joe McFarland. "Get some high-

school kids in here competing,
and who knows, maybe they'll
be here ina couple of years."
Bringing in schools from
near East Lansing and Mount
Pleasant gives the Wolverines
a chance to have a step up on
the other prominent wrestling
universities in the state, Central
Michigan and Michigan State.
According to InterMat's
recruiting profiles, Michigan
has dominated Michigan State
and Central Michigan when
it comes to signing in-state
recruits. Of the 21 recruits
coming out of Michigan high
schools in 2014,10 are wrestling
at colleges in Michigan. Four of
them are bound for Ann Arbor,
while no other school has more
than two.
St. Johns is one of the top-
ranked wrestling squads in
the state and frequently sends
athletes to top wrestling
programs inthe country. There's
a strong connection between
St. Johns and Michigan, as
Logan Massa's older brother,

sophomore Taylor Massa, and
freshman Payne Hayden both
wrestle for the Wolverines.
Hall, who weighs in at
the 138-pound weight class,
wrestled at Cliff Keen Arena
during his junior season at St.
Johns and said that he gets a
special feeling every time he
sets foot in the building.
"I love wrestlingonthis mat,".
Hall said. "The atmosphere and
fans here are crazy. I can't wait
to be back on this mat next year.
There's nothing like it."
McFarland added that it's
tough to get recruits to campus
in the winter because of both
sides' packed schedules. That's
where having high-school
meets before college meets can
be most helpful.
Because the high-school
programs competed before the
Michigan's match, the athletes
were able to enjoy mat-side
seats for the evening's main
event. As if the intrastate
rivalry needed any more fuel,
it was wrestling's "Maize Star"

event for the year, meaning the
pep band was in attendance to
provide a better atmosphere.
According to St. Johns
coach Dave Phillips, the most
important thing for a high-
school wrestler to consider
when choosing a college is
finding the place where one
feels most at home.
Hall believes he has found
just that at Michigan.
The high schooler's eyes
glazed as he looked around the
gym watching the high-school
parents file out. He had just
won, 7-5, to remain undefeated
on the season, and solidify a St.
Johns victory.
Soon the stands refilled,
and Michigan took down the
Spartans in front of a roaring
crowd. Hall kicked back in his
mat-side seat and enjoyed one of
his last times being in the arena
as a spectator.
This time next year he will be
under the lights striving for Big
Ten and nationalchampionships
that he's been dreaming about.


BASKETBALL
From Page 1B
"I hope they realize," Morgan
said, pausing to catch himself. "I
hope we realize what happened
today - that's just not okay."
By time the buzzer sounded
on that mid-February night,
Michigan was in the midst
of what seemed like an epic
collapse to a once-promising
season. In hindsight, it was a
team learning how to win by
learning what it's like to lose.
Still, the memory of the
hallway that night doesn't seem
any brighter.
The first half of Saturday's
game, save for the Wolverines'
10-2 outburst to open the eve-
ning, had all the makings of a
rerun of last year.

Michigan's start silenced
the crowd, but not for long.
Michigan State stormed
back with a 19-6 run and the
Spartans held an eight-point"
lead for much of the half. After
a Wolverine turnover on a
near-shot clock violation, one
longtime Michigan State official
noted that it was the loudest
atmosphere he'd ever heard in
the arena, a notch above last
year's game, the previous best.
It was the moment that
would've cracked last year's
freshmen-laden lineup: Nik
Stauskas, Glenn Robinson
III, Spike Albrecht and Mitch
McGary in his first-career start.
Like the year before, the
ensuing huddle, and each one
after it, would've been full of
blank stares and an overall
sense of defeat.

But that moment never came about it, Morgan stepped in.

the Wolverine offense to a win
in spite of the hostile Breslin
Center crowd. The freshman
made nine of his 10 attempts
from the line, giving the
Wolverines sole possession of
first place in the Big Ten and
their fifth win in their last seven
attempts against the Spartans.
It capped a grow-up-in-front-
of-your-eyes week for a team
that was supposed to crumble
after a poor non-conference
showing and the loss of pre-
season All-American Mitch
McGary.
The team's current run
certainly can't be judged side-
by-side with last year's NCAA
Tournament run, but the
message was the same. After
drilling his 3-pointer to cap
a miracle win over Kansas,
Burke was quick to reference

all the misses, the in-and-out
buzzer beaters - Indiana, Ohio
State, Wisconsin - that led to
that moment.
When asked why this year's
rivalry game was different
than last, Morgan's comments
echoed Burke's.
"We've been tested a lot this
year. That might be the differ-
ence," he said. "We had a couple
road games where we did get
knocked back and we didn't
fight back. Learning from those
experiences, being able to keep
our composure in those situa-
tions, really helped us."
Last year's loss in East
Lansing is a distant memory
because of what happened in
March - a string of wins from a
team that learned, in its losses,
how to win.
Just like Saturday.

Series in review: MSU

By ERIN LENNON
Daily Sports Writer
What happened Thursday:
It took seven tries, but late in
the third period at Joe Louis
Arena, on his eighth shot, junior
forward Phil Di Giuseppe
knocked a rebound puck past
Michigan State goaltender
Jake Hildebrand, snapping the
No. 14 Michigan hockey team's
four-game losing streak.
For the 14th-ranked
Wolverines (4-2 Big Ten, 12-6-
2 overall), though, the first
period mimicked those in the
losing streak. Michigan was
plagued by a series of unlucky
bounces and golden saves
throughout, and failed to find a
presence down low.
With five seconds remaining
in the frame, freshman forward
JT Compher took a pass from
sophomore forward Boo Nieves
to even the score at one.
Michigan State (2-4-2, 8-12-
3) brought itself back early in
the third period when forward
Joe Cox's shot in the slot was
deflected by teammate Michael
Ferrantino to tie the game.
Something old, something
new: Back together on a line
after midseason struggles,

Compher, junior Alex Guptill
and senior Derek DeBlois
put together the Wolverines'
strongest weekend this season.
The line recorded five goals
and five assists in two games
against Michigan State.
On Michigan coach Red
Berenson's newest line, Di
Giuseppe partnered with
sophomore forwards Andrew
Copp and Nieves for the
first time this season. The
trio combined for 13 shots,
including an assist and a goal.
Meanwhile, the duo of
junior forward Zach Hyman
and senior Luke Moffatt added
seven of the Wolverines' 36
shots. Hyman, who hadn't
recorded a point since Dec.
2 against Ohio State, nearly
scored twice.
What happened Friday:
Early last week, Copp, an
Ann Arbor native, said he was
confident the Wolverines could
beat "those guys" every night.
So after five periods of back-
and-forth hockey between
Michigan and Michigan State,
the Wolverines showed what
that dominance might look
like, including three goals in
the third period en route to a
5-2 victory.

Though the offense posted
its best scoring performance
since Dec. 2, Michigan's
penalty kill was burned twice
in five man-down situations,
making the Spartan's power
play - which came into the
game with a 12.9-percent
success rate - look like the
team's best unit.
One at Munn: After each
victory, Michigan circles up
in the locker room to sing a
sped-up rendition of "Hail to
the Victors." Following the
conclusion of the Wolverines'
sweep of the Spartans, the chant
penetrated the cinderblock
walls of Munn Ice Arena.
For any Michigan team -
especially one with12 Michigan
natives on its roster - a sweep
of Michigan State is special.
But for the Wolverines' senior
class, doing it on the road was
even more remarkable.
Friday night was the first
time the five-man senior class
took a game from the Spartans
at Munn Ice Arena.
Compher, calm and
collected: Compher's four-
point night was the most by a
Michigan player since Oct. 13,
2011. He now leads the team in
scoring with 20 points.

Fighting mentality carries 'M' to win How It Happened:

By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
EAST LANSING - Jordan
Morgan had experienced the
environment of the Breslin
Center before. He'd been there
when the noise of the Izzone
and the play of the Spartans
had been too much to handle.
He'd been there when his
team overcame the variables
of Michigan State. And after
one last fight on Saturday, he'll
never have to experience it
again as a player.
"I'm kind of glad I'm never
going back there," Morgan said.
In Michigan's 80-75 victory
over No. 3 Michigan State,
Morgan and the Wolverines'
fighting mentality powered
them through another game.
It began in the Wolverines'
first series of offensive tries
as they converted four baskets
on four opportunities to take
a 10-2 lead. Michigan didn't
want a repeat of last year's
game in East Lansing, where
sophomore guard Nik Stauskas
said earlier in the week - and
sophomore guard Caris LeVert
repeated after the game -
Michigan got "punked."
"We weren't going to let that
happen this year," Levert said.
And Michigan didn't. Though
the Spartans (7-1 Big Ten, 18-2
overall) dominated the paint in
the first half, they didn't relent.
When fifth-year senior
forward Jordan Morgan and
redshirt junior forward Jon
Horford got in early foul trouble.
- each played just eight minutes
in the first half - Michigan (7-0,
15-4) persevered.
Despite shooting just 41
percent from the field, including

5-for-16 on 2-pointers, Michigan
was able to remain down just six
heading into the locker rooms,
thanks to 6-for-11 shooting from
beyond the are.
Even though they remained
within striking distance
entering the second half, the
Wolverines didn't come close to
playing their best ball.
"We didn't play a very good
first half at all," Morgan said.
"So we just stayed composed
and just kept with the game
plan. We knew they were going
to have their runs. We just had
to keep staying positive and
keep fighting."
In the second half, Michigan's
fighting mentality nearly
spilled over onto the court as
it continued to claw back from
a deficit that began with 10:56
left in the first half. Unlike in
the first half, which saw the
Wolverines at times pass the
ball around the perimeter of the
3-point line, Michigan started
getting the ball in the paint and
at the basket as Michigan State's
foul trouble started to bubble.
Down 53-50, LeVert gathered
a rebound off a Gary Harris
missed triple and threw the ball
ahead to sophomore forward
Glenn Robinson III, who drove
to the basket only to get rejected
at the rim by Russell Byrd.
It was then that a little
hooting and hollering - not by
Michigan State's fans, but its
players - got to the Wolverines.
In stepped Morgan to make sure
nothing more came of the play
and aftermath.
"The guy blocked Glenn's
shot and got all up in Glenn's
face," Morgan said. "It wasn't
necessary, you know? And I
just stepped in to the aid of my

teammate. We don't really play
that type of basketball."
While Morgan and Michigan
State's Keith Appling were given
technical fouls - giving Morgan
four personal fouls - the play
sparked Michigan.
"You have tobe able to go out
there and stand your ground
and that's what we did today,"
Morgan said. "They knocked
us back on our heels and we
were able to respond and keep
believing we were going to win."
While the near altercation
helped trigger Michigan's
aggression to close out
the game, it was also past
experiences, both at Michigan
State and earlier this season
that helped too.
"I can't help but credit that to
the tough games we had to play
so far," Morgan said. "We've
been at Duke, at Iowa State -
those are some hard places to
play. And with that young team,
we got thrown in the furnace a
little bit. And it's prepared us for
these moments where we can
stay composed."
For a young team, Michigan
looked calm and composed
under pressure at Breslin.
Playing like a veteran, freshman
guard Derrick Walton Jr. scored
a career-high 19 points - tied
for the team-high with Stauskas
- including an and-one 3-point
play with 2:29 minutes left that
made up the middle of an 8-0
run that gave Michigan a lead it
would never relinquish.
The whole sequence, a
Horford block leading to an
outlet pass from LeVert to
Walton, made Walton admit it
was a great play, but the fact that
he did it here "in front of this
crowd with these guys makes it

much more special."
When Michigan beat
Michigan State in East Lansing
in 2011 after former guard Stu
Douglass sunk a 3-pointer in
the game's final 30 seconds,
the game didn't represent the
mentality that is present with
the Wolverines now.
"That one was more a shock,"
Morgan said. "This one was like
we knew this was going to be a
fightandwetookitveryseriously."
With any rivalry game, such
play should be expected, but
with the style of play embodying
Michigan every time it's on the
court, it makes these games even
more memorable.
"Well, guys," said Michigan
State coach Tom Izzo, "you
wanted a rivalry and you wanted
two good teams. I guess we got
what we've been asking for."

What happened Saturday:
The Michigan men's basketball
team earned itsthird straight win

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Wolverines rebound from loss, topple Wisconsin

Michigan's strong
defense limits
Badgers' offense
By SHANNON LYNCH
Daily Sports Writer h;
The Michigan women's
basketball team isn't perfect,
and on Sunday afternoon at the
Kohl Center in Wisconsin, that
much was
clear. The WISCONSIN 44
Wolverines MICHIGAN 60
had only
two players score in double
figures and lost two players to
foul trouble.
Despite those issues, Michigan
never let the Badgers get into an
offensive rhythm and came out
victorious, 60-44.
"It wasn't our best game," said
Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico. "But we were able to put
it together and people stepped
up at crucial times for us to be

successful."
After a home loss to Ohio
State last Thursday in which the
Wolverines shot 31 percent from
the field, madeonly two 3-pointers
and committed 17 turnovers,
they headed to Wisconsin with
something to prove.
"The other night, when Ohio
State took their lead, we kind of
collapsed, and we weren't able
to fight back after that," Barnes
Arico said. "I thought when
Wisconsin took that lead today,
we regrouped, we made a run
of our own, which was great to
see, and then we got stops on the
defensive end which led to the
offensive run."
The Badgers got on the board
first with a layup from top scorer
Michala Johnson, but junior
guard Shannon Smith quickly
followed up with a jump shot
to tie the game. That type of
sequence established a theme
for the Wolverines. As often as
Wisconsin scored, Michigan
always seemed to come right

back at the Badgers with a basket
of its own.
The Wolverines took a 27-22
lead into the half but allowed the
Badgers to catch up early after
the break. With a little over 17
minutes left, Wisconsin took its
first lead since the beginning
of the first half, but Michigan

so it was a good defensive effort.
We really wanted to take away

The win keeps Michigan
undefeated on the road at 6-0.
And it means the Wolverines still
hold another important record
intact - this season, the team has
yet to lose back-to-back games.
Barnes Arico said bouncing back
from a big loss is one of things her
team has done well.
"I think tonight was a great
example, because we didn't
really play exceptionally well,"
Barnes Arico said. "We were
able to come on the road, where
