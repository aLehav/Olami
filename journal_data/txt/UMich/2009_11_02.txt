Final budget
cuts Promise,
'U' fund ing

After month-long
delay, Granholm
signed final six
budget bills Friday
By MATT AARONSON
Daily News Editor
Gov. Jennifer Granholm signed
into law Friday the final six bills of
a budget that showed the wear and
tear of a legislature crippled by par-
tisan battles over how to solve the
state's many problems.
For the University, the bud-
get bears bad news on two fronts:
eliminating the popular Michigan
Promise Scholarship program and
once again cutting back state fund-

ing provided to the University.
The Michigan Promise Schol-
arship provides tuition money to
more than 96,000 Michigan col-
lege students. Performance on a
merit exam given in high school
determines the amount a student
receives, which can total anywhere
from $500 to $4,000 over four
years.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald told the Daily last month
that an estimated 6,096 students at
the University of Michigan would
be eligible for Promise grants this
academic year.
These students now have to find
another way to fill that gap in their
tuition costs.

Mathews took REID
a knee on the

closed his eyes, hung his head and

A few players and assistant

With three games left in his
career - four, if the Wolverines
can somehow scrape together one
more win - and the season quickly
spiraling out of control, Mathews
had no words.
And who does? What's left to
say?
How do you justify Rich Rodri-

is getting outplayed by the best of

the best - three losses last year
were against teams with sub-.500
records, and let's not forget how
epically bad this Illinois team
really is.
The Fighting Illini have the
worstscoring offense in the con-
ference, mustering just 16 points a
game. Michigan made them look
good, with more than 500 yards of
offense and 38 points.
The Illini have the worst scor-
ing defense in the conference, giv-
ing up more than 27 points every
game. Michigan put up just 13 and
died whenever they sniffed the red'
zone.
And Illinois has the worst rushing
defense in the conference, too. With

fourshots fromthe one-yardline,
the Wolverines couldn't even punch
it in with a chance to go up 20-7.
The numbers are there: Michi-
gan got dominated - thoroughly
dominated - by a team that hadn't
beaten Football Bowl Subdivision
competition in 364 days before
Saturday.
As Ford broke through on the
Illini's final touchdown, shedding
pathetic attempted tackles on the
way, Mathews and his teammates
saw how quickly this season (one
that started so well, with four
straight wins) was becoming a
nightmare.

'U' settles in
case of former
Dental student

Civics and syrup: Students, politicians
talk pertinent issues at campus brunch
At event, students 1C 1

Alissa Zwick sued
the University for
wrongful dismissal
By KYLE SWANSON
DailyNewsEditor
University officials have settled
out of court with a former Dental
* School student who says she was
wrongfully dismissed from the
school.
Asettlementwasreachedoutside
of court last week after University
officials dropped an appeal of a rul-
ing that ordered the University to
pay the former student more than
$1.7 million. The amount of the set-
tlement has not been disclosed.
In May 2006, Alissa Zwick, a
former Dental School student,
filed two lawsuits against the Uni-
versity after being dismissed from
the University in her third year of
study. Zwick claimed she had been
caught in a turf war between a Den-
tal School administrator and sev-
eral faculty members over how to
accommodate her attention deficit
disorder.
The associate dean of the Dental
School told Zwick she was expelled
from the Dental School because

she wasn't fit to practice dentistry.
At the time of her expulsion, Zwick
had a B average.
Zwick's lawsuits claimed her
expulsion was a violation of free
speech, due process, breach of con-
tract and defamation. The cases,
filed in the Washtenaw County
Circuit Court and the Michigan
Court of Claims, were consolidat-
ed and sent to a U.S. District Court
for judgment.
After the University filed a
motion to have the case dismissed,
all claims were dropped except
Zwick's due process claim.
The case went to trial in fed-
eral court and in December 2008
the jury awarded Zwick $220,000
in economic damages, $500,000
in non-economic damages and $1
million in punitive damages. The
University was also ordered to
pay approximately $320,000 for
Zwick's legal expenses.
The University began an appeal
after the verdict was issued, which
was dropped as a result of last
week's settlement. As part of the set-
tlement, both parties are asking the
court to erase the earlier verdict in
favor of the settlement agreement.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald confirmed that the

chat education, state
budget, other topics
By OLIVIA CARRINO
Daily StaffReporter
At a "Pancakes and Politics"
event held yesterday, the Black
Student Union brought together
students and political officials
over brunch for a wide-ranging
discussion of governmental issues
facing students.
Held at the William Monroe
Trotter Multicultural Center, a
group of about 30 students and
legislators broke up into groups
to talk about education, taxes and
urban policy, among other things.
Later, the conversation led to a
more open forum.
Ned Staebler, aDemocratic can-
didate for the 53rd District of the
Michigan House of Representa-
tives - which includes Ann Arbor
- encouraged everyone present to
participate in this coming Tues-
day's elections.
"Now we need everybody's
skills, we need everybody's input,"
he said. "Democracy is not free.
Its price is participation. Every-
body needs to participate."
Discussion of the state budget
and its effects on students domi-
nated the conversation.
Sen. Liz Brater (D-Ann Arbor)

TOREHAN SHARMAN/Daily
State Sen. Liz Brater (D-Ann Arbor) talks with students about a variety of issues at a brunch hosted by the Black Student
Union at the William Monroe Trotter Multicultural Center yesterday.

touched on the Michigan Promise
Scholarship's funding issues that
resulted from the state's budget
crisis and billion-dollar deficit
and led to the discontinuation of
the program.
The final state budget that
Democratic Gov. Jennifer Gra-
nholm signed into law Friday cut
the merit-based Promise Schol-
arship, which provides tuition
money to more than 96,000
Michigan college students. In an
interview last month, University

spokesman Rick Fitzgerald told
the Daily that an estimated 6,096
students at the University would
be eligible for Promise grants this
academic year.
At yesterday's event, Brater
said Democrats have proposed a
number of revenue options to help
mitigate the situation.
Brater stressed that the state
revenue stream needs to be
reviewed and restructured. She
recommended amending the state
constitution to make its tax code

more progressive - meaning it
would be based more on an indi-
vidual's ability to pay.
Staebler echoed this sentiment.
"When you're designing your
tax system you want to have a
couple of different things in mind.
You want it to be simple and you
want it to be fair," he said. "And I
think a progressive tax system is
by far the most fair system that we
can have."
The conversation also turned

Michigan St mulls booia lc idn
600n staff cuts bilgcld kfn ig

EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -
Michigan State University expects to
eliminate nearly 600 positions over
two years and may close two depart-
ments and as many as 30 academic
programs in budget cuts.
The university's Board of Trustees
reviewed the proposed cuts at its Fri-
day meeting.
The administration has proposed
closing the Geological Sciences and
the CommunicativeSciences andDis-
orders departments. It also may close
as many as 30 majors, specializations
and other academic programs.
Those cuts must later be approved
by the board. Students enrolled
in eliminated programs would be
allowed to complete their studies.
The university says nearly 600
positions likely will be affected by
cuts in the next two years, with 19
percent coming from layoffs.

In a finalcampaignswingon behalf
of the only governor seeking re-elec-

on Sunday pitched Democratic Gov.
Jon Corzine's bid as a key component
forthe White Houseto make good on
its political promises.
"He's one of the best partners I
have in the White House. We work
together,"Obamasaid. "Weknowour
work is far from over."
Obama drew 6,500 people at a rally
in Camden and another 11,000 later
in Newark, according to White House
estimates. He urged supporters to
work hard to give Corzine another
term in office so he can work with
Washington to help repair a brittle
economy. A Corzine loss would be
seen as a political embarrassment for
the White House.
Obama tagged Republican lead-
ership and lax regulations for the
economic crisis and dismissed GOP
candidate Chris Christie's criticism of
Corzine. Their race is seen as a tossup,
and a Monmouth University/Gan-
nett New Jersey Poll released Sunday
found Christie backed by 43 percent
oflikely voters and Corzine by 42 per-
cent.

Ultimately, their discoveries
could lead to vast improvements
in the medical world in fighting

biological clock which includes
anything from such as jetlag and
obesity to depression and mood
disorders.
"I think it's goingto change the
way a lot of people think about
how the clock sends signals to the
rest of the body," Diekman said.

FBI: Abdullah fatally
shot after firing at
agents, resisting arrest
DETROIT (AP) - Hundreds
of people offered hushed prayers
Saturday at the funeral for a slain
Detroit mosque leader while
authorities across the border
in Canada made the final two
arrests in a criminal case that is
stirring some anger in the Mus-
lim community.
Luqman Ameen Abdullah was
remembered as a caring man who
followed the tenets of his Islam
faith as an imam, or prayer leader,
of a small mosque north of down-
town. Fellow imams said.he was
generous and a good brother, and
no one mentioned the FBI's claim
that he had a violent, anti-govern-
ment ideology.
The FBI says Abdullah, 53, was
fatally shot inside a suburban
warehouse Wednesday after fir-
ing at agents and resisting arrest.
Agents wanted him on charges of
weapons violations and conspiracy
to sell stolen goods, one of 11 people

named in a criminal complaint.
"We ask Allah to reward him
with the promised reward of those
who are martyred," Imam Talib
Abdur-Rashid of New York told
mourners at the Muslim Center in
Detroit.
As is custom, men sat on the
floor, shoulder to shoulder, during
the service, with women watch-
ing and listening in the rear of the
large room. Prayers were given
in Arabic and English during the
30-minute service.
Some speakers demanded an
independent investigation of
Abdullah's death, saying the fatal
shooting seemed excessive.
Imam Abdullah El-Amin asked
people to decline to speak to
reporters and avoid news cameras
outside.
No terrorism charges have
been filed against Abdullah,
formerly known as Christopher
Thomas, or the 10 others accused
in the complaint. According to
the FBI, Abdullah was a leader
of a national radical Sunni group
that wants to create an Islamic

City Council needs student voice, enthusiasm, experience

and some members of City Council - regarding University
students: We don't care about city elections. This opinion H

tunity to make an even stronger mark on
Ann Arbor government by voting in the
general election for City Council. Though
Ann Arbor's perceived hostility to Repub-
licans has made the general elections rela-
tively uneventful in recent years, this year
sees two independents making strong bids
for City Council seats. Issues surrounding
the race include the debate over what to
do about Argo Dam and the Stadium Bou-
levard bridge - structures that many feel
are in need of repairs - and a scandal that
occurred over the summer when several
City Council members were discovered to
be sendingemails during meetings, possibly
in violation of the law.
As vital members of the community with
unique ideas for what the city should look
like, students have an obligation to silence
claims that we don't care. So head to the
polls tomorrow, and as you do, keep the fol-
lowing information in mind.
In the Ward 4 race, Democratic incum-
bent Marcia Higgins faces a challenge from
University economics student Hatim Elhady.
Higgins is seeking reelection so that she can
continue her work on Ann Arbor Discover-
ing Downtown (A2D2), a plan to streamline
the city's zoning laws. She also believes that
her experience will come in handy as City
Council approaches tough budgetary deci-
sions. Elhady, on the other hand, believes
that projects like the Stadium Boulevard
bridge need immediate attention from City
Council and wants to get to work addressing
concerns of Fourth Ward residents.
Both Higgins and Elhady are, in their
own ways, appealing candidates. Higgins
expressed an enthusiasm for density in Ann
Arbor and opposes height caps. Though this
thinking may put her at odds with many
residents and other members of City Coun-
cil, it's meaningful to students, whose need
for affordable housing would be benefited by
her independent, progressive approach. But
Higgins just can't match the unique experi-
ence that Elhady can bring as a University
student.
As a student, Elhady understands that

r es rC Ive election laws negativey impc
students' abilities to participate in city gov-
ernment. As an acknowledgement of this,
he wants the primary election moved back
to April, when students are still around.
He also wants to prioritize the elimination
of apathy among students and residents by
truly staying in touch with his constituents.
To this end; he plans to write newsletters
and hold regularly scheduled meetings with
constituents. Elhady is eager to interact
with the people of Ann Arbor and listen to
their concerns. While not a perfect candi-
date - he could stand to gain by adopting
some of Higgins's thinking on density and
zoning - the opportunity to put a student
who is knowledgeable and passionate on
City Council can't be passed up. The Daily
endorses HATIM ELHADY FOR CITY
COUNCIL, WARD 4.
In the Ward 1 race, Democratic incumbent
Sabra Briere is being challenged by indepen-
dent Mitchell Ozog, a native of Poland who
fled the country in the 1980s. Briere said the
budget will be one of the most important
issues before City Council next term, and
that she possesses in depth knowledge on
the issues that comes with experience. Ozog
was not available for an interview with the
Daily, but his website cites fiscal responsibil-
ity and transparency as the most important
considerations for choosing City Council
members.
Ozog's background makes him an inter-
esting candidate - he was actively involved
in the Solidarity movement against com-
munism during the Polish Revolution in the
1980s. He is also enthusiastic about bring-
ing a fresh perspective to City Council. But
ultimately, Briere's experience and ability to
relate to the concerns of both residents and
students outweighs Ozog's fresh perspec-
tive. Briere has a long history of involvement
with Ann Arbor political life. While her
housing priorities don't always match those
of students, she believes in hearing all sides
of the debate and reachingcompromises that
will please students, residents, landlords
and developers. The Daily endorses SABRA
BRIERE FOR CITY COUNCIL, WARD 1.

andt the National
Endowment for
Humanities also
gave $200,000.
The expansion was much needed,
given that the museum was originally
built nearly 120 years ago and had just
1,000 square feet of gallery space -
enough to squeeze in only about 300
artifacts. The new 20,000-square-
foot addition to the museum will have
about 1,500 artifacts on public display.
Most of these artifacts are ancient
treasures either excavated by Univer-
sity archeologists in the early 1900s
or acquired indirectly through deal-
ers and donors. The museum's website
gives details on just about every one of
the University led major excavations,
which have resulted in a collection of
more than 100,000 artifacts. But even
with the expansion, the museum will
be able to display only about 1.5 per-
cent of its massive collection. The rest
will remain in locked storage.
I'm startled by that reality, but per-
haps I shouldn't be: It's nothingnew in
our society for wealth to be dubiously,
concentrated among the elite few. The
Kelsey Museum is just one of hun-
dreds of museums across the world
that hoard priceless cultural artifacts
in storage. These treasures deserve to
be displayed, butget displacedbecause
they are redundant or conventionally
uninteresting to the museum.
The University might have the
right to hold these surplus artifacts
in closed storage. After all, it was the

efforts of University archeologists
that unearthed the objects in the first
place. And academic institutions also
have ancient artifacts for research
purposes. You never know when any
one of those 100,000 pieces may be
needed by researchers in a hurry, and
it's good to have them all on hand.
I don't necessarily disagree with
any of those arguments. Rather, I sim-
ply want to point out and encourage
consideration of the opposing argu-
ment.
Most of the major excavations that
brought those artifacts to Ann Arbor
happened before the modernization of
antiquity laws across the world. That
was a time when archeologists could.
walk into a foreign country and leave
with extracted artifacts without any
violation of law. Egypt - with lead-
ers who were concerned more about
appeasing the West than about pro-
tecting their own - was famous for
actually giving away artifacts.
During that golden age, University
archeologists made significant finds
in places like Turkey, Tunisia, Egypt
and Iraq. Expeditions to Karanis,
Egypt proved especially fruitful -
the museum's website indicates that
almost 45,000 Karanis objects arrived
in Ann Arbor between 1926 and 1936.
Another 13,000 objects were brought
over from another particularly fruit-
ful site, Seleucia-on-the-Tigris (now
in Iraq).
But as that age passed, society
began to realize that nations, no mat-
ter how primitive their democracies,
had somie right of ownership over-
objects extracted from their soil. After
that, institutions had to be more care-
ful and acquire artifacts only from
reputable dealers.
Restrictions and attitudes have
evolved further. While they could once
plead ignorance, institutions today
bear some responsibility for actually
investigating the history of the works
they acquire to make sure they were
not smuggled or stolen.
There's no reason to assume that

the University has ever broken the
rules. On the contrary, its researchers
have generally done a great benefit to
society by unearthing and investigat-
ing artifacts that tell tales of lost civi-
lizations. But there's a little more it
could do.
Instead of holding precious cultural
artifacts in storage, why not circu-
late them among museums in areas
of the world that are not so saturated
with priceless, displayable artifacts?
Or better yet, why not conditionally
return these artifacts to the countries
from which they were taken? I think
it's a safe assumption that many of
the 100,000 artifacts in storage will
never be needed by a researcher. But
if one ever is, the University will know
exactly where it is and will have an
agreement in place to get it back.
Should museums
give artifacts back
to original owners?
Some might argue that the artifacts
should not go back because places like
Iraq and Egypt cannot be trusted to
secure them. How ironic that such a
patronizing defense is used to protect
possessions acquired in the time of
blinded colonialist advances, which
left these nations compromised in the
first place.
I certainly don't advocate returning
artifacts to war-torn, unstable coun-
tries. At its discretion, the University
would be welcome to withhold those
pieces itelieves might be damaged or
lost if returned. I argue only that some
effort be made to recognize that peo-
ple once took what wasn't theirs, and
the fact that it was then legal does not
make the action right.

FACEOFF: ELECTION DAY
WASHTENAW COUNTY ENHANCEMENT MILLAGE
DREW DENZIN I

KATHY GRISWOLD|

Millage too costly: Vote no

Education at stake:,Vote yes

Two mills is too much for all but the most fortu-
nate in our community. I urge you to vote "No" on
the millage proposal, but more important than how
you vote is how you make the decision regarding
this millage and future decisions in your personal
and professional life.
In Malcolm Gladwell's new book, "What the Dog
Saw," he describes how Cornell MBA students ana-
lyzed the financial statements of Enron Corpora-
tion for a class project. They concluded that Enron
stock was overvalued and recommended that stock-
holders sell. The price of Enron stock continued to
increase and eventually doubled until... well, you
know the rest of that story. Would history be differ-
ent if investigative reporters from The Wall Street
Journal or The New York Times had done the anal-
ysis and published the results?
Similarly, I have attempted to do an analysis of
the Ann Arbor Public Schools financial statements.
And of course, my MBA is from the University, not
Cornell. This analysis is posted on the Citizens
for Responsible School Spending website at www.
A2CRSS.org.
The most salient points include the following:
First, threats from Lansing to drastically cut
school funding are just that - threats. 'Threats have
been made in the past. School funding is a top prior-

ity and when the political games end, funding will
likely be restored to a fair level.
Second, the proposal would result in an 11.4
percent increase in local school taxes. Residents
already pay 17.52 mills.-And commercial property
owners, including farmers, already pay this plus an
additional 18 mills in school taxes. And Ann Arbor
Public Schools already receive over $12,000 per
pupil per year in local, state, federal and private
sources.
Finally, AAPS operating expenses have risen at
over twice the rate of inflation since 2002. This
growth is simply not sustainable.
Some very intelligent, politically savvy people
have been hoodwinked by the lack of transparency
in school financial reporting and the limited, mis-
leading information being passionately presented
by children's teachers and other school officials.
They are unaware that special interests and the
Michigan Education Association have spun this
campaign message into one of deception, urgency
and emotional fear. I urge you to make an informed
decision based on facts, not fear, and vote "No" on
the millage proposal.
Kathy Griswold is a member of Citizens
for Responsible School Spending.

Tomorrow, Washtenaw County is holding a vote
for a millage that could change students' lives. Gov.
Jennifer Granholm recently initiated a series of dev-
astating retroactive cuts to public education through-
out the state. With your support - a yes vote - the
millage will ensure thatquality K-12 public education
will carry on while our state legislature reorganizes
itself in the 21st century. This money will help cover
a portion of promised funds to Washtenaw County's
schools - promised funds they are no longer getting
due to severe shortfalls. The governor already cut
$297 per pupil this year, with projected cuts of anoth-
er $600 per pupil next year. This does not include an
additional line item cut that affectsAnn Arbor Public
Schools directly.
I am in the unique position of seeing Washtenaw
County education from multiple angles. I had many
opportunities in music and sports during my K-12
Ann Arbor Public School days. I attended the Univer-
sity of Michigan, where I pursued a bachelor's degree
and a master's degree in the sciences and education.
My wife and I call Ann Arbor home: I teach biology
at the high school level in Saline and have young chil-
dren in the Ann Arbor Public Schools. It worries me
that my children won't have the same educational
opportunities I did if the millage doesn't pass.
There are many opponents to the Washtenaw
County Enhancement Millage who argue that the
"system is broken" and "irresponsible spending" on
the part of local schools is to blame. They will argue
that a yes vote is a vote for the millage - nothingshort,
in their eyes, of a bailout for a failed system.
I agree the system failed. However, the irrespon-
sibility doesn't lie with local districts - it lies with
a deeply flawed state tax structure that was once
intended to support Michigan's public schoolsbut has
had problems since 1994. Approving this millage will

enable us to continue to provide a quality education
for our students while allowingthem to participate in
elective classes like technology, the arts, sports and
career exploration.
In tough times, investments for the future provide
the greatest dividends. Historically, families move to
the villages, towns and cities of Washtenaw County
because of the excellent schools. The commitment
of the students, school employees, parents and com-
munity is an incredible formulathat works for all par-
ties involved. The reputation of excellence made our
communities desirable places to live and put our real
estate in high demand. Changing this formula and
underfunding our schools puts our children, school
employees, communities and home values atrisk.
One generation of studentsshould not be penalized
with massive teacher layoffs, large class sizes and the
elimination of curricula while adults fix the system.
A basic comparison comes into play here with green
energy. Ittakes time to fix our global dependence on
fossil fuels. For example, a household transitioning to
green energy here in Ann Arbor still needs heat and
hot water. Likewise, as Lansing finds itself a new tax
structure, we as a county still need to educate our
local students with integrity.
In other words,.we can't throw the baby out with
the bath water. The state as a whole is in crisis, but is it
the right choice to cripple local public education?
Voting yes on the Washtenaw County Enhance-
ment Millage is essential. It will not only maintain
integrity in continued quality instruction but will
also keep and generate jobs in the greater Ann Arbor
area. I chose to stay local and givebackto the commu-
nity thatserved me growing up. As aUniversity alum,
I ask for your support tomorrow.
Drew Denzin is a University alum.

The millage would raise $30 million for Washtenaw County
schools by increasing property taxes.

A 'Serious' spectacle

The Coens get
biblical in their new
dark comedy
By ANDREW LAPIN
DailyFilm Editor
Along with the usual disclaim-
ers in the end
credits of "A
Serious Man"
comes this mes- A Serious
sage: "No Jews
were harmed in Man
the making of At the
this film." The Michigan
writing-directing Focs
superteam of JoelF
and Ethan Coen
has finally embraced its most Jew-
ish of last names, and in so doing
has crafted one of the most original,
unexpected and thought-provoking
films of the year. But take that dis-
claimer seriously: From a faith-
based perspective, there is some
serious harm being wrought upon
some serious Jews.
The Coen brothers uprooted an
ages-old Biblical parable and trans-
planted it to rural Minnesota circa
1967, making a film that is both
surreal and reflective of their own
childhoods. The movie revels in the
misfortune of its protagonist, Larry
Gopnik (theater veteran Michael
Stuhlbarg), and invites the audience
into his downward spiral. And yet it
maintains a delicate tone through-

out, never veering into overly sadis-
tic or condescending territory.
Larry is by all accounts a good
Jew. He sends his kids to Hebrew
school and always looks out for his
fellow man, eventaking in his down-
trodden brother Arthur (Richard
Kind,'TV's "Spin City"). But Larry's
life starts to unravel, first gradually,
then uncontrollably. His wife wants
a divorce so she can marry her new
lover, a beloved community figure;
his request for tenure at the commu-
nity college he teaches at is threat-
ened . by an anonymous dissenter;
he's kicked out of his own house and
becomes strapped for cash; and one
of his students attempts to bribe him
for a passing grade, then threatens
to sue for defamation. Through it all,
Larry maintains with wide-eyed dis-
belief that he hasn't done anything.
Fatalism has always been a com-
mon theme for the Coen brothers;
many of their protagonists, from
The Dude in "The Big Lebowski"
to Sheriff Bell in "No Country for
Old Men," are bounced powerlessly
through events outside of their own
control. But Larry may be their
first character who looks beyond
the immediate consequences of the
events themselves and tries to ask
what they all mean. He's looking
for answers in his life where there
don't seem to be any.
Larry visits three different rab-
bis in his quest to find meaning in
his misery,andtheygive himadvice
of about the same level of useful-
ness as Jefferson Airplane lyrics.

One of the biggest cosmic jokes in
the movie is an image that will be
very familiar to some Jews: the
exalted senior rabbi, sitting alone in
his ridiculously ornate palace of an
office adorned with assorted Juda-
ica, doing nothing and speaking to
nobody. "The rabbi is busy ... he's
thinking," says his assistant.
There's never a dull frame in a
Coen brothers picture. With the
help of director of photography
Roger Deakins, their long-time col-
laborator, they can make even the
most rudimentary images pop with
a kind of ethereal resonance. The
simple sequence of Larry climbing
up on his roof to fiddle with his TV
antennae carries resounding power:
The camera admires him frombelow
and above, and for a brief moment
he appears to be content as the ruler
of his household kingdom. As Lar-
ry's misfortunes pile up, we become
more and more vested in his plight;
the Coen's brilliant characterization
of him through shot frames and the
smartly focused script help give him
the kingly grandeur he constantly

seeks. Under any lesser filmmaker,
Larry would have simply become a
sad sack, and the film would have
been unbearable to sit through.
But what does it all mean? On its.
surface "A Serious Man" is simply a
retelling ofthe story of Job, in which
God and Satan make a bargain over
how much they can push a good,
pious man before he renounces his
faith. Yet there seems to be more
going on here than mere biblical alle-
gory. As per usual, the Coens aren't
interested in spelling anything out:
without giving anything away, the
ending doesn't make deciphering the
rest of the film any easier. But unlike
the misjudged anticlimax that con-
cluded "No Country," this ending
feels more complete, somehow.
In a movie where one man is
being punished without rhyme or
reason, no one singular image is
going to wrap things up nice and
pretty. Instead, what is here further
cements the Coen's status as legends
of the screen, and guarantees that "A
Serious Man" will be seriously talked
about for years to come.

BUDGET
From Page 1A
Daily in late September that, unsure
about the Promise Scholarship pro-
gram's fate, "the University set aside
some one-time funds ... to fill these
expected financial aid gaps."
Also in late September, Cynthia
Wilbanks, the University's vice
president for government relations,
told the Daily that the University
would fill that void for students
with demonstrated financial aid
need if the Promise Scholarship
was cut.
"We have committed to meeting
the full financial need and we have
been prudent inthe waywe have bud-
geted so that we will have resources
for those students who have the
financial need and as of now, do not
appear to be receiving the Promise
grants," she said in late September.
Earlier this month, after a letter
to state legislators from a business
advocacy group encouraging law-
makers to pass a budget proposal
that cut the Promise Scholarship
bore her name on the letterhead,
University President Mary Sue
Coleman issued a statement in
which she distanced herself from
the recommendation.
She wrote: "It is in the best
interests of the state to look to
the long term and focus on the
highest priorities - including
higher education - as we lay the
groundwork for the future."
On that higher education front,
the budget signed into law Friday
provides $325,347,400 in state
appropriations for the University
of Michigan in Ann Arbor for the
coming fiscal year.
This represents a drop of
around .4 percent from last year's
SETTLEMENT
From Page 1A
appeal hadhbeen dropped and that
a settlement had heen reached.
"The matter has been resolved
and the earlier court judgment
has been vacated," Fitzgerald
said.
Fitzgerald refused further
comment, saying he wasn't per-
mitted to comment on the details
of the settlement or any other
specifics of the case.
Deborah Gordon, Zwick's
attorney,toldtheAssociatedPress
Friday that she was not allowed
to comment on the details of the
settlement.
"I am only allowed to say the
case has been resolved," Gordon
said.
Details of the settlement have
not yet been filed with the Court.
Zwick no longer studies den-
tistry, despiehavingheen accept-
ed to eight other dental schools
before enrolling at Michigan. She
is now pursuinga master's degree

EVENT
From Page 1A
to a discussion about how the
dismal state of the economy has
led to a "brain drain" of Detroit
in which highly educated people
with advanced degrees leave the
area to find jobs elsewhere.
Susan Baskett, chair of the

Ann Arbor Board of Education,
stressed the importance of pri-
mary education. She said both
parents and the state should
place an increased emphasis on
the value of completing primary
education so individuals can then
go on to complete college.
"You have to hold your people
accountable, your kids account-
able, your neighbors' kids account-
able," she said. "You have to start
local, hold everyone accountable,
and know your policy. There is
strength in numbers and you want
to make sure all your kids gradu-
ate in a timely manner."
In interviews after the event, the
politicos in attendance said they
felt they benefited from the event
just as much as the students.
Baskett said the event was
important because it gave politi-
cians the opportunity to hear the
concerns of the state's students.
Brater said she felt the student
input was insightful and that the
event was an education process
"in both directions."
"I'm learning from the stu-
dents and the students can get
some information from me about
what's going on in the state gov-
ernment," she said.
The coordinators of "Pancakes
and Politics" said the goal of the
event was to educate students on
political issues and to publicize the
upcoming elections this Tuesday.
LSA sophomore Autumn Hol-
mes, who helped coordinate the
event, said they wanted those in
attendance to step outside the
student "bubble."
"Our purpose today is to intro-
duce people to individuals who
are in government, who are in
power and have the power to basi-
cally make the laws," she said.

funding, but beat earlier University
projections by 2.8 percent. Those
projections had estimated state
funding to drop to $316,572,000 for
fiscal year 2010.
The amount of state funding
influences the make-up of the rest
of the University's budget, from
the funding of different schools
and academic programs to student
tuition levels. But officials are quick
to note that they have very care-
fully accounted for potential drops
in state funding while crafting bud-
gets in recent years.
Markinga continued reliance on
cost cutting and tuition increases
to fill the state funding void, state
appropriations account for 21.75
percent of revenues in the Universi-
ty's General Fund budget proposal
for fiscal year 2010. In that same
budget, tuition and fees account for
65.19 percent.
From fiscal year 2003 to fiscal
year 2004, state funding for the
University experienced a free fall,
plummeting by about 10 percent -
or $36,356,600.
Since then, the appropriations
have hovered mostly in the $320-
$330 million range.

From 1997 to 2009, higher educa-
tion funding in Michigan had the
second-lowest rate of growth in
the country. At 17 percent, Michi-
gan was second to last, besting only
South Carolina. In that same period
of time, the national average of
growth in higher education funding
was 67 percent, or 5.6 percent per
year. Michigan's funding grew at an
average of 1.4 percent per year.
Thebudget signed Friday marked
the end of a months-long scramble
to make ends meet for a state in his-
toricallybad economic shape.
Legislators rushed to fill a $2.8
billion gapbefore the state's original
Oct. 1 deadline - when its new fiscal
year started.
In that dash, Republicans stood
by a strategy of cutting state pro-
grams, while Democrats looked for
ways to increase revenues. With
control of the House and Senate
split between the two parties, stale-
mates ensued. They missed the Oct.
1 deadline, and after the state's gov-
ernment shut down for less than
two hours, lawmakers passed a
temporary budget that gave them
one more month to figure it all out.
For many, the resulting budget is

far from a sigh of relief, with deep
cutstoschools,Medicaidreimburse-
ments, financial aid to college stu-
dents and most state departments.
According to The Associated
Press, Granholm said in a conference
call to reporters that the Republi-
cans in the state Senate "have taken
what I think is an extreme position
in regard to this budget."
"The Democrats have compro-
mised," she said, "the Republicans
have not."
GOP Senate Majority Leader
Mike Bishop's spokesman told The
Associated Press that "the budget
was passed with bipartisan sup-
port," and that Bishop plans to
release alistof ideas for making gov-
ernment and schools more efficient

What was proven on Saturday
is simple. Michigan is, for the first

team in the Big Ten, and it's not get-

So, where do the Wolverines go

real question is if the rest of the
team will follow his lead these next

CHAMPAIGN-FUL

Mich'igan 'D' falls apart 'For secondstraight
_ season M' squeezed
In third quarter at Iioi: by Juice Williams

By MICHAEL EISENSTEIN
Daily Sports Editor
CHAMPAIGN - Before Satur-
day, Michigan had given up more
than three points in the third
quarter just once.
Against Illinois, that's when
everything unraveled.
In those 15 minutes, the Wolver-
ines surrendered 21 points and 209
yards to a team that had not beaten
an FBS team in 364 days.
"We are frustrated because we
gave it away, we just gave it away,"
senior defensive end Brandon Gra-
ham said after the game. "We was
the better team today. Not taking
that away from Illinois - they
came - but we know we gave it
away."
The Fighting Illini's 38-13 vic-
tory marked just the second time
in 52 seasons they have beaten
Michigan at Memorial Stadium.
For linebacker Stevie Brown,
the second-half defensive collapse
felt like it took nearly that long.
"I never thought it was going to
get out of reach like it did, it was

just unfortunate what happened,"
said Brown, struggling to find
words. "It's disappointing. That's
all I can say. It's disappointing."
That disappointment stems
from the second quarter, when
Michigan held the Illini to minus-
15 total yards and the Wolverine
offense built a six-point lead. At
halftime, Wolverine coach Rich
Rodriguez told Michigan to "just
step on their throat and extend
our lead," according to junior cor-
nerback Troy Woolfolk.
And the Wolverines had every
expection that they would come
out and do just that - a feeling
confirmed by quarterback Tate
Forcier's apparent 77-yard touch-
down bomb to wide receiver Roy
Roundtree on the first drive after
the half.
An official review reversed the
on-field touchdown call, though,
leaving Michigan with four scor-
ing chances from the one-yard
line. Roundtree's non-score was
inconsequential until, on the next
three plays, senior running back
Carlos Brown could not extend

the football 36 inches across the
goal line. Even senior running
back Brandon Minor, a player that
Rodriguez says transforms the
offense's physical play, couldn't
punch it in on fourth down.
But that wasn't the backbreaker
for Michigan.
The start of Illinois' next drive
looked similar to one of the Wol-
verines' second-quarter pos-
sessions during last weekend's
blowout loss to Penn State. Against
the Nittany Lions, Michigan was
backed up to its own two-yard line
on third-and-long when the snap
went through the back of the end
zone. The safety proved to be a
critical point of the game.
Against Illinois Saturday, with
the Illini starting at their own one-
yard line, the Wolverines were in
a position to reverse fates on the
goal line. Michigan had ended the
previous three Illini drives with
.third-down sacks and was playing
well.
This time, though, was much
different.
Illinois went 99 yards and

scored in less than three minutes
on a drive capped by a 70-yard
touchdown rush by running back
Mikel Leshoure. He was barely
grazed on the play.
And as the Wolverines' halftime
lead dissolved, so did their focus.
"We have to have enough resolve
to bounce back and not let it affect
you," Rodriguez said. "I know the
guys on the sideline were tryingto
keep guys into it. ... I can't explain
everything that goes on in minds
of young people all the time."
Sophomore defensive tackle
Mike Martin said Michigan let
up and was too relaxed after half-
time.
"It hurts, obviously, but we just
went back to the sideline, Coach
was tellingus to dust it off," Martin
said. "We were just trying to have
a better series the next series."
But the Wolverines looked
increasingly worse on the next two
Illini drives, giving up a touch-
down both times.
The third quarter was so differ-
ent from the second that, even

By RUTH LINCOLN
Daily Sports Editor.
CHAMPAIGN - During the
week heading into last year's
Michigan-Illinois game, Illini
coach Ron Zook sat down one-
on-one with his star quarter-
back, Juice Williams.
According to Williams, Zook
simply told him, "to relax and
have fun."
Zook's coach-speak sounded
cliche, but Williams's result
definitely wasn't. He stunned
the Big House crowd with a
Michigan Stadium record of
431 all-purpose yards (310
passing, 121 rushing). Leaving
a dismantled Michigan defense
in the dust, he led Illinois to a
45-20 win.
Last Monday, Zook met
with Williams again. The sit-
uation was slightly different,
but the conversation didn't
stray far from the one the
coach and his quarterback
had a year ago.
"He pulled me aside Monday

and said, 'Relax, just let things
happen, just let plays come to
you,' "Williams said. "And that's
what I did."
Williams heeded Zook's
advice once again, this time to
the tune of 220 yards (123 in the
air, 97 on the ground).
Struggling this season to find
any kind of consistency, Wil-
liams may have needed Zook's
coaxing a little more than last
year. And with the plan for Wil-
liams to split time with redshirt
freshman Josh Charest, no one
knewhow much Michiganwould
see the senior. But just like last
season, he exploded against the
Wolverines.
For two years in a row, Wil-
liams has proven that the Michi-
gan defense can't contain the
mobile quarterback. And the
coaching staff can't quite figure
out why.
"Juice Williams got alive a lit-
tle bit and they had a soft balance
with the run and the pass, you
know, we just didn't respond,"

The Wolverines' resume was
lacking.
The Michigan men's soccer team
had lost three of its previous four
games and boasted only one win
over a ranked opponent this season.
If they had any intentions of play-
ing soccer in the postseason, Mich-
igan coaches and players knew they
would need to find their identity
yesterday afternoon against No. 12
Northwestern.
Well, they found it.
After beating the Wildcats 1-0 in
double overtime, redshirt sopho-
more goalkeeper Chris Blais took
off his shirt and sprinted the length
of the field to rejoice with his team-
mates at the U-M Soccer Complex.
"We needed this win, and we
need next week's win," Blais said.
"It was a must-win for all of us if
we want to make the NCAA Tour-
nament, so I think that's where the
intensity came from."
Before yesterday's upset, the
Wolverines (2-3 Big Ten, 9-5-1
overall) had struggled against Big

Ten opponents. They tried to beat
opposing teams with pretty soc-
cer, pushing up their defenders
to sustain long possessions in the
attacking half. But this aggressive
style left Michigan susceptible to
counterattacks and ultimately led
to lasses at the hands of Penn State,
Indiana and Michigan State.
So in yesterday's game against
Northwestern (2-2-1 Big Ten, 9-3-4
overall), Michigan changed its style
of play and finally learned how to
win ugly.
"I'm kicking myself for not work-
ing with the team in that manner
earlier, and it's the way you win in
the Big Ten," Michigan coach Steve
Burns said. "So we sat in, absorbed
more of their pressure, allowed
them more possession instead of
being pressed up on them to deny
space behind them."
Behind this new philosophy
and a 4-4-2 formation, the Wol-
verines kept Northwestern's
speedy forwards in check. But
Michigan's offense floundered
without help from its outside
backs, and the team struggled to

kid again. It was like my first goal
in house league."
Caporusso and the Wolverines'
offensive momentum carried into
Saturday, during Michigan's 6-3
win at Taffy Abel Arena. Everyone
was on the attack - eight different
Wolverines scored in the opening
weekend of CCHA play. Fifteen
players tallied at least one point
over the weekend.
"It's good to see some bal-
anced scoring," Michigan coach
Red Berenson said Friday. "Even
though it's a different lineup, we
still had the same cast of charac-
ters who were playing well. And
for our fourth line to score two
goals, that's a bonus."
On Friday, Michigan (4-2-0
overall, 2-0-0 CCHA) attacked the
crease and scored three rebound
goals including Caporusso's.

Wolverines take fourth place at Big Tens

Is Michigan
turning into a
basketball school?

CHAMPAIGN -
The jokes started about two
minutes after Illinois broke
free for a 70-yard touch-
down to take the lead for good.
It came in the form of a G-Chat
iessage from a
friend, a Tweet
from UMHoops,
a sly crack from
a guy in the
press box. It's
become the
sarcasm-fueled
response of a
fanbase fed up ANDY
with a previ- REID
busly foreign
concept - los-
ing. At least, until Michigan coach
Rich Rodriguez took over.
It's the cry heard 'round the Wol-
verine world this week.
"Well, at least it's almost basket-
ball season."
It was funny at the time, espe-
cially as Michigan continued to
unravel against one of the worst
teams in the Big Ten. But with time
to digest it and see the anti-Rich
Rodriguez vitriol scorch across
Internet message boards, I'm realiz-
ing this might actually be real.
I remember being in high school
and hearing Michigan State fans
use the same logic. It always seemed
like a pretty fair-weathered mindset
to have, especially when the football
team had three or four games left
to play.
ButI came to expect it. Michigan
State would lose to Michigan and
then drop four straight games and
Wait anxiously for football season to
be over. It was fine.
Now, though, it's Michigan fans
clamoring for the hardwood. It's
unimaginable.
First off, there's no questioning
that this is 100 percent a football
school, and even if the team has a
few lean years now and again, it will
probably stay that way. I mean, the
Wolverines still have the most wins

of any Division-I team, best winning
percentage of all time, the winged
helmets, the "Go Blue" banner and
The Victors.
But people like winning - espe-
cially those who follow Michigan
sports - and after a while, Rodri-
guez's 8-13 record just isn't goingto
cut it. And who's hot right now?
Michigan basketball.
With the season starting on
Friday with an exhibition game,
Michigan fans have every right tobe
excited about this team. An NCAA
Tournament appearance, two of the
Big Ten's most explosive players, an
engaging coach and a very intrigu-
ing schedule are all reasons to get
pumped.
But let's be honest. In all reality,
the "basketball season is here!" talk
is less about the basketball team
and more about football. Fans are
getting frustrated, which would
quickly and quietly go away if the
Wolverines start winning - or just
beat Ohio State. Hell, even a trip to
the Little Caesar's Pizza Pizza Bowl
would suffice.
After investing a lot of time and
heartache into 2008's disaster,
Michigan fans were more ready
than ever for the 2009 season to
start. And when the Wolverines
scorched through four straight
wins, you could almost hear Wol-
verine nation let out a collective
sigh of relief - Michigan football
seemed tobe back.
I think fans are just begging for
any little sign of improvement.
Obviously, people got their hopes
up a little too much. Football will
continue to dwarf basketball in
every facet on this campus. But if
John Beilein and the boys continue
to grow and Rodriguez continues to
flounder, things might start chang-
ing.
Stranger things have happened.

With a tremendous amount of
youth on the roster, the Michi-
gan women's cross country team's
fourth-place finish with 122
points at the Big Ten Champion-
ships was a good enough effort for
coach Mike McGuire.
"I thought realistically our goal
was top five," McGuire said. "I
was happy with the fact that (for)
seven out of our nine runners, it
was their first Big Ten meet ever."
Four true freshmen made
the trip to State College. Fresh-
men Kaitlyn Patterson, Rebecca
LAKERS
From page 1B
sophomore Luke Glendening also
scored their first goals of the sea-
son.
Saturday featured the same
prolific scoring attack.
The Lakers (4-4-0, 1-3-0)
tmatched the Wolverines' aggres-
siveness out of the gate. But
despite outshooting Michigan
20-10 in the first frame, Lake
Superior State still trailed 3-2.
After allowing a goal less than
two minutes into Saturday's
game, junior goalie Bryan Hogan
settled down and finished the
game with a season-high 35 saves.

Addison and Jillian Smith posted
three of the Wolverines' top four
times in an event where a team's
five best times count toward the
team's score.
"The kids stepped up to the
challenge," McGuire said. "I was
definitely happy with their per-
formances."
But it wasn't a standout fresh-
man that led the Wolverines
yesterday. Redshirt sophomore
Kaitlyn Peale once again high-
lighted Michigan's effort by post-
ing the fourth-best time overall
with a team-high 20:33.
Peale has placed in the top 10in
all five events this season and has

set the pace for the Wolverines in
their last three.
The fourth-place finish for No.
22 Michigan may serve as a posi-
tive indicator for the rest of the
season. The NCAA Great Lakes
Regional is less than two weeks
away, and the Wolverines are the
top-ranked team in the region.
Big Ten foes Penn State, Illinois
and Minnesota, who finished
first through third in the Big Ten
Championships, are all in sepa-
rate regions.
"If we just hold serve and we're
first or second in the region, we
qualify automatically to go the
national meet, and that's been

one of our goals all year long,"
McGuire said.
The Wolverines have 16 fresh-
men and redshirt freshmen on the
roster - and just one senior.With
suchayoungsquad, thehighrank-
ings and expectations for this sea-
son are certainly impressive.
But the team's prospects for the
future are looking even brighter.
"We have people capable of
working their way into being
first-or second-team All-Big Ten,"
McGuire said. "That's our goal -
continue and improve.
"We have the people here, and
I think the future looks bright for
us."


Hogan stalled the Lakers' attack
by making nine saves during Lake
Superior State power plays.
The Wolverine defense also
helped out on a few occasionswith
goal-saving plays throughout the
weekend. And even though the
unit's only goal came as an emp-
ty-netter, the defense was just as
active in the offensive zone.
Precise passing and continu-
ous movement made things easy
for Michigan, who was leading
or tied with the Lakers for all but
eight minutes of this weekend's
games.
"When you play in games, the
intensity in the games is hard to
duplicate in practice," Berenson
said. "We're getting better. ...We

should be getting better every
week. If we can stay healthy and
stay confident and work hard,
it's a lot of hard work, (then)
we're going to play better. We
had some real good spurts this
weekend."
Michigan has had good spurts
throughout the young season, but
sustaining that high level of play
is key in the Wolverines' develop-
ment. Having so many players in
on the action this weekend devel-
oped confidence that is a step in
the direction of playing three
solid periods of hockey.
Earlier this week, Berenson
changed up the forwards' lines
after he said that his-team was
underachieving. This weekend,

those changes paid off. 4
Getting Caporusso going in
Michigan's first two CCHA games
could prove to be just as impor-
tant as the two wins the Wolver-
ines got in Sault Ste. Marie.
"I just heard a bunch of the
crowd and some of our supporters
go, 'Yo Louie.' And I was just like,
'I guess everyone knew I was in a
slump.' I didn't know how public
this was," Caporusso said of the
reaction to his first goal.
Caprousso - seemed happy to
answer questions about scoring
goals again. And if his teammates
continue the aggressive style of
offense that they displayed this
weekend, he won't have to worry
about carrying the entire load.

generate legitimate scoring oppor-
tunities. Neither team controlled the
ball for an extended period of time.
As a result of Burns's conservative
strategy, the game remained score-
less through 90 minutes of regula-
tion and the first overtime period.
And after 101 minutes ofugly soc-
cer, the Wolverines finally scored an
ugly goal. Northwestern goalkeeper
Misha Rosenthal made two spec-
tacular saves on consecutive Michi-
gan shots, and a Wildcat defender
blocked a third shot from cross-
ing the goal line. Redshirt junior
defender Matt Schmitt collected yet
another rebound to deliver the game
winner for the Wolverines.

Schmitt was sidelined with a
hernia early in the season after a
summer of heavy lifting. The red-
shirt junior still battles effects of
the injury, but has fought through
the pain to contribute to the team.
Schmitt scored in each of Michi-
gan's last two games - his only
goals so far this season.
"It's better late than never,"
Schmitt said. "The work in the off-
season is startingto pay off for me."
The Wolverines head to Colum-
bus next weekend to conclude the
regular season against the Buck-
eyes in another pressure-filled con-
test. A victory would give Michigan
a strong case for an at-large bid to
the NCAA Tournament, but a loss
might cripple its chances.

secondary coach Tony Gibson
said. "I mean, I don't know what
to tell you other than that."
Michigan fluidly contained
Williams in the first half.
Four Wolverines - defensive
end Brandon Graham, defen-
sive tackle Ryan Van Bergen,
middle linebacker Kevin Leach
and linebacker Stevie Brown

- sacked Williams in the first
half for an impressive minus-
35 yards.
That was four more sacks
than Michigan tallied last sea-
son against Illinois.
But when Illinois changed
from a zone read in the first
half to a more open scheme,
things began to unravel for the
Wolverines.
"That comes down to guys not
having their gaps, something
technical, some kind of techni-

cal error," sophomore nose tackle
Mike Martin said. "I know they
changed their running game to
not as much of a read. They were
just hitting the gaps, and we were
doing real well against them try-
ing to read against us."
The switch worked for the Illi-
ni, as they rushed for 317 yards
and passed for 94 yards in the
second half.
Although defensive coordina-
tor Greg Robinson is Michigan's
third at the position in the last

three seasons, the Wolverines
have had trouble controlling
mobile quarterbacks for some
time.
Quarterbacks like Texas's
Vince Young, Ohio State's Troy
Smith and Oregoh's Dennis
Dixon ran over the Wolverines in
recent years.
But it wasn't as though Michi-
gan overlooked Williams and the
Illini. All week, the Wolverines
noted Williams's talent and rec-
ognized the team's record didn't

tell the whole story.
Of those who endured last
year's 3-9 debacle, no one
could forget Williams's record-
setting afternoon. Even after
Saturday's loss at Memorial
Stadium, last year's defeat was
still fresh.
"We had a lot of payback from
last year in our stadium, so we
wanted to give it back to them in
their stadium," Graham said. "I
mean, a loss is a loss, but it hurt
to lose to Illinois."

Former walk-on
tallies 11 tackles in
second start of
the season
By COURTNEY RATKOWIAK
Daily SportsEditor
CHAMPAIGN - He ran
around the outside, straight at
the quarterback, as if he had
done it every game this season.
But it was linebacker Kevin
Leach's first sack - the first
from a non-defensive lineman
all year, in fact. With the Illinois
line staying with its blocks and
Juice Williams unable to find
a receiver, Leach met Williams
with a vengeance to force a nine-
yard loss.
It was hard to find a feel-good
story in the Wolverines' embar-
rassing loss, but Leach's 11 tack-
les Saturday were solid after the
coaches decided to start the for-
mer walk-on over defensive vet-
eran Obi Ezeh.
"We're trying to, well, we
thought they were going to do
more spread, and they did,"
Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez
said. "Kevin's pretty athletic."
But in his next breath, Rodri-
guez talked about the ineptness
of his defense instead of attempt-
ing to further explain the per-
sonnel decision.
"Obviously, we didn't play
well defensively," he contin-
ued. "Missed tackles are upset-
ting. Probably more upsetting
to me is when the ball is laying
on the ground, and it seems like
it's there for an eternity and we
weren't able to get on it."
Leach earned a scholarship
about two weeks before the
beginning of the season. Against
Eastern Michigan, he started at
weak-side linebacker after the

on the play."
That gave Michigan a chance
to narrow Illinois's lead for
pride's sake, if nothing else. But
judging from Michigan's red-
zone conversions up to that point
- one touchdown in six trips
inside the 20-yard line - getting
in the end zone was statistically
looking like a longshot.
And it was. Graham's blocked
punt was his second in two
games, with his block against
Penn State coming in the third
quarter with the Wolverines
down by 22. And just like in last
week's game, the Wolverines
squandered the good field posi-
tion by immediately turning the
ball over.
This time, it was courtesy of
quarterback Tate Forcier, who
ran on first down and fumbled
to end the drive. Forcier finished
the game with three fumbles
(two lost), and Illinois rubbed
the win in the Wolverines' faces
a few plays later with a 79-yard
touchdown run.
Graham finished the game
with seven tackles and one sack,
bringing his career sacks total to
25 and passing former Wolverine
James Hall (1996-99) for second
place on Michigan's all-time
sacks list. But as his individual
accomplishments continue to be
overshadowed by the team's fail-
ures, he hasn't found much con-
solation in his play.
"It just hurt," Graham said,
echoing his mantra during this
season's other three losses.
"We're just trying to get to a
bowl and we're trying to finish
strong, and I'm gonna make sure
we go in there and we don't lose
focus.
"Stuff happens, we lose, wp
gotta just take it and run witf it,
and you know, just make sure it
don't happen again. It just hdrt
to keep saying it but it's gonna
happen."

CLF REEDER/Daily
Redshirt sophomore Kevin Leach picked up his second career start this weekend in Michigan's 38-13 loss at Illinois.

Big Ten suspended starter Jonas
Mouton for punching a Notre
Dame player the week before.
But Leach wasn't even listed on
this week's three-deep chart at
middle linebacker.
Ezeh refused to talk to the
media after Saturday's game,
which was the first in 29 games
he didn't get the starting nod.
He ended the game with just one
assisted tackle while playing in
fourth-quarter garbage time, but
he still leads the team in tackles
this season with 63.
Rodriguez and his team have
started two walk-ons this year at
crucial defensive positions. The
other, walk-on safety Jordan
Kovacs, has now started four
straight games on the strong side.
The practice of starting walk-

ons on defense over recruited,
scholarship players seems to be
turning into a trend - which,
even if Leach and Kovacs turn
in strong performances, shows
in disturbing fashion the vulner-
ability of the Wolverines' paper-
thin defense.
"I think you have to constant-
ly coach their mentality, with
so many guys playing for the
first time in different roles than
they've ever been in," Rodriguez
said. "But at the end of the day,
it's - you've gotta go out there
and execute, and as coaches, we
have to put them in a position
where they can make plays and
make it happen, and we're just
not doing that the last couple of
weeks."
One of the only players who

has consistently been able to
make those plays is senior defen-
sive end Brandon Graham. But
on his most impressive play of
the game - his second blocked
punt in two games - the rest of
his defense had already sealed
the collapse for the Wolverines.
With 3:49 left in the game and
the Wolverines down 31-13, Gra-
ham lunged through the middle
to knock the ball down just after
Illinois punter Anthony San-
telli's foot made contact. The
ball bounced backward 26 yards
before rolling out of bounds at
the 15-yard line.
"It just happened, just keep
coming and it opened up for me,"
Graham said of the play. "That's
all I think about, just keep com-
ing and somebody's gotta get up

From page 1B "I don't want to say it's slip-

redshirt junior linebacker Jonas wins that we should," Woolfolk
Mouton could only explain it said. "We're just playing for pride playing for

Michigan picked
11th in the Big Ten
in preseason polls
By AMY SCARANO
Daily Sports Writer
ROSEMONT, Ill. - There are
a lot of question marks and not
a lot of answers coming along
with the start of the women's
basketball
team's season. NOTEBOOK
But that isn't
necessarily a bad thing.
The Wolverines went 10-20
last season and are ready to
start fresh.
Of last season's six return-
ing players, just two of them
- junior guard Veronica Hicks
and senior center Krista Phil-
lips - were regular starters. If
Michigan wants to improve,
Michigan's sophomores will
need to step up this year. In
addition, the freshman class,
led by highly touted guard Day-
eesha Hollins, will need to make
an impact on the court.
"I think Dayeesha Hollins is
ready to play," Michigan coach
Kevin Borseth said at Big Ten
Media Day last week. "I really
do. I think she is a kid that you
can expect to play and you can
expect to do well. I don't think

it's fair to put the weight on her
shoulders, but I think she is a
kid that needs to be played."
In past years, Borseth has
given freshmen the choice to
redshirt if they don't think they
are ready to play on the Big Ten
stage, but that likely won't be an
option this year.
"We don't necessarily want to
have to count on young kids too
often, but we're in that position
now in our program," Borseth
said. "We don't know who those
people are going to be or what
they're going to be able to do
when the lights come on."
With a young roster, the
program will be able to build
consistency over the next few
years. Once the freshmen have
a season of experience, Borseth
is hoping for big things.
"Dayeesha Hollins can deliv-
er," Borseth said. "She's not self-
ish. We get selfish players, and
I teach them to be unselfish so
they can make players around
them better."
BIG SHOES TO FILL: Ashley
Jones is back after redshirting
her senior season due to a foot
injury. She was a team leader
even while restrained to the
bench last season, but she can
now be a much-needed leader
on the court, too.
"She's definitely a glue play-
er," Hicks said. "She helps our

program stick together. Losing
her last year was like a big blow
to us ... She is just someone you
can't replace. She is the type of
person you really want on your
team and she is the type of per-
son who helps you build your
program."
Two years ago, as a junior,
Jones averaged 20 points per
game and helped the team fin-
ish 19-14 overall.
"She is really good at taking
the ball to the basket," Phillips
said. "I think that is something
we were really missing is some-
one who can really slash to the
basket and take it to the hole
and finish."
THE NUMBERS: The Wolver-
ines are ignoring the fact that
they are ranked last in both the
preseason Big Ten coaches poll
and media poll. While teams like
Ohio State and Michigan State
- ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in the
conference, are circled on every
opponent's calendar, Michigan
is skipped over. Nobody else in
the league expects big things
out of the young team this year.
"Any time you bring in young
kids, they're wet behind the
ears and it's a little more diffi-
cult," Borseth said. "So there's
going to be some growing pains
.,. but we sure got some kids that
are going to be able to contrib-
ute to our success."

THE QUICK BREAKDOWN
M A IZE GAU GE The Michigan Daily football writers break down the weekend's stats that don't show up in the box score. The Mesk-o-Meter measures the success of special teams, the Rod-o-Meter
judges how emotional (positive or negative) Rich Rodriguez was following the game and the Hype-o-Meter measures the fans' performance.
MESK-O-METER ROD-O-METER HYPE-0-METER
Mesko averaged just 37.3 yards per punt and was outkicked These losses seem to be getting to the ol' ball coach. The student section wasn't even filled for one of the Illini's
by his Illinois counterpart. Hemingway fumbled a punt return, Rich Rod was listless after the Illinois game, shedding biggest games. Need we say more? Though we were
and Stonum didn't get much on kickoffs. The one positive: his usual feisty self for a downtrodden version of him- simpressed by the amount of "It's Always Sunny" orange-
Graham blocking a punt for the second straight game. Rich Rods self in the postgame presser. We're nota fan of that.B| men, very few in the crowd were wearing costumes.

Roundtree has come up with some big
catches in his short Michigan career, but
this season, he may be remembered for
coming up a yard short on a potential
game-changing touchdown reception.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY TOP 10 POLL
The Michigan Daily Top 10 returns for its ninth installment this season. Each week, Daily
Sports staffers will fill out ballots, with first place votes receiving 10 points, second-place votes
receiving nine, and so on. The results are published with first-place votes in parentheses.

1. Florida (7): Tim Tebow,
now has the most rushing
touchdowns ever in SEC
history. Yeah, he sucks.

2. Alabama: Unlike the
AP poll, we won't penalize
the Crimson Tide for
having a bye week.
3. Texas (4): Mack Brown
still has never lost to
Oklahoma State, thanks to
McCoy's 100th career TD.
4. Boise State: The Broncos
remain a favorite in our poll,
but it looks like TCU might
edge them out for a BCS bid.
5. Cincinnati: Even the
Bearcats' backup QB can
throw for four touchdowns
in an easy win. Yeesh.


6. Oregon: Pete Carroll had
never given up more than 43
points at USC - until he faced
Oregon. Hello, Rose Bowl.
7. Iowa: Does "Stanzi and
Hyde" or "Jekyll and Stanzi"
sound better? Or maybe
"Stanzi being Stanzi."
8. TCU: The Horned Frogs
are rolling and they still can't
fill the stands...and Texas
still has warm weather.
9. Penn State: Three
touchdowns in four minutes
in the final quarter will
usually do the trick.
10. LSU: The Tigers haven't
lost to Tulane in 17 years, but
this was their first shutout of
the Green Wave since 1969.
