STATE REGULATIONS
'U'educates
community on
state neonatal
blood bank

Blood samples from
babies in Michigan
used for research
without consent
By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily StaffReporter
If you were born at a hos-
pital in Michigan after 1984,
your blood is probably stored in
Detroit and used for research.
But most Michigan-born resi-
dents don't know this.
Since 1984, blood samples
of nearly every baby born in
Michigan were collected and
saved and now sit in Wayne
State University's Tech Town
warehouse in Detroit as part
of the Neonatal BioTrust. In
2009, lawmakers decided to
allow the 4 million-plus sam-
ples to be used in research
without requiring consent
from individuals.
Life Sciences and Society,
a program in the University's
School of Public Health, held a
town hall meeting last week to
inform students and Michigan
residents about the bank and
to help them make a decision
about the future of their blood.
The town hall meeting was one

of several that have taken place
throughout the state during
the year.
Sharon Kardia, director of
LSS and chair of the Depart-
ment of Epidemiology in the
School of Public Health, one
of the leaders of the town hall
meetings, said many people are
surprised to find out about the
blood bank.
"(They) had no idea that
their blood spots or their kids'
blood spots were in this bio-
bank," Kardia said. "The next
piece after the surprise is usu-
ally (a kind)of concern: 'Well
what else do they have, why
wasn't I told and when are they
goingto ask?"'
It is estimated that 20,000
University students have their
blood in the BioTrust, accord-
ing to an LSS press release. The
program seeks to inform stu-
dents that they can sign a con-
sent document or ask that their
blood not be used.
Kardia said researchers
want the public to give consent
and use samples from people
who give consent so that good
relationships are maintained
between the research and pub-
lic communities.
"Consent is such a funda-
mental part of good research

Residence hall

By RAYZA GOLDSMITH
Daily StaffReporter
Equipped with wireless Inter-
net, air conditioning, a game
room and a kitchen for student
use, the updated Couzens Resi-

dence Hall is far from the build-
ing it was when it originally
opened in 1925.
Faculty, staff and alumni
joined University President Mary
Sue Coleman yesterday at a dedi-
cation ceremony for the renovat-
ed hall, which is home to about
525 students. Couzens reopened
at the beginning of the semester
after undergoing a massive inte-
rior renovation. The $49 million
reconstruction, which is part of
a larger University undertak-
ing to improve residence halls,

required Couzens to close during
the 2010-2011 school year.
Coleman said she is happy
with the outcome of the building,
especially its aesthetics.
"It is better thantI ever thought
it would be," Coleman said in an
interview after the event. "The
creativity that's gone into repo-
sitioning the spaces and making
everything just absolutely gor-
geous ... I mean, I couldn't have
even imagined it (turning out)
this good, so I'm thrilled."
In addition to the amenities

like wireless Internet and con-
trollable air-conditioningin indi-
vidual rooms, Couzens also now
has a number of tools for group
study, music practice rooms and
new audio and video equipment
available for students. The build-

Owner cites
panhandling as
factor in closure
By HALEY GOLDBERG
Daily StaffReporter
Candy lovers are filling their
pockets with the remaining
chocolates, gummies and suck-
ers before This & That candy

store closes next month.
Andrea Graef, owner of This
& That, said she is closing the
East Liberty Street business
- which opened in July 2010
- by the end of November due
to lack of patronage, corporate
competition and a rise in pan-
handling and crime in the area.
Graef said the competition from
nearby businesses such as CVS,
7-Eleven and the Tower Mini
Mart on Maynard Street, as

well as the Borders closure last
month, contributed to her deci-
sion to shut down her store.
"The area has made a dras-
tic change from when I first
wanted to be down here," she
said. "It seems that the area has
become kind of depressed."

Daily StaffReporter, For the Daily
After getting the cold shoul-

now turning to the University's
student government for support
on a controversial unionization
issue.
GEO asked the Michigan
Student Assembly's legisla-

the unionization of graduate

request that was recently denied
by the Michigan Employment

GEO President Saman-

move.

Contrary to its name,
the campus organization
Slinky has little to do with
the children's toy.
Inspired by the toy's
ability to spring back,
Business junior David
Kolodny co-created the
organization with Busi-
ness junior Stephan
Sakhai to support nations
or communities that are
struggling to "spring
back" after tragedies.
Kolodny formed Slinky
after the Haiti earth-
quake in 2010. Anxious
to help those affected by
the disaster, Kolodny and
some friends from the

Alpha Epsilon Pi frater-
nity began raising money
to donate to the struggling
nation.
The organization sold
items, like plastic brace-
lets with the phrase "long
live Haiti" in Creole, and
hosted events like a fund-
raiser at Dream Nightclub
on South Fourth Avenue.
Through these efforts,
the group raised about
$10,000, according to
Kolodny.
One year and multiple
fundraisers later, Slinky
has 20 dedicated mem-
bers.
"We try to instill in

our members an avenue
for them to become lead-
ers," Kolodny said. "We
encourage them to be able
to give in their own way."
Other efforts of the
organization include fun-
draising for Japan after
a 9.0 magnitude earth-
quake caused a destruc-
tive tsunami this past
spring. Kolodny said he
also encourages members
to aid other local organi-
zations.
"It's easy on a college
campus to lose touch," he
said.

Hearing scheduled
for SAT cheating . C

Representatives of
SAT to testify about
testing security
GARDEN CITY, N.Y. (AP) -
Representatives of the Education-
al Testing Service and the College
Board, which administer the SAT
college entrance exams, have been
invited to testify at a state Senate
committee hearing examiningthe
recent SAT cheating scandal on
Long Island, a spokesman for the
Senate committee chairman said
yesterday.
Meanwhile, prosecutors said
additional arrests are likely as the
investigation into cheating has
widened to include at least one
private school.
Seven current or former stu-
dents at Great Neck North High
School were arrested last month
after authorities said six of the
students paid a seventh - now
attending college - up to $2,500
to take their SAT exams for them.
All have pleaded not guilty. Pros-
ecutors and others questioned the

effectiveness of security at testing
sites after it was revealed that the
college student allegedly imper-
sonated a female student during
one of the tests.
Sam Eshaghoff, a student at
Emory University in Atlanta who
previously attended the Universi-
ty of Michigan, is accused of using
phony identification documents
to represent the students during
the SAT exams. Eshaghoff, who
has pleaded not guilty, was due in
court yesterday, but the proceed-
ing was adjourned.
Sen. Kenneth LaValle, chair-
man of the state Senate's Higher
Education Committee, who pre-
viously has expressed concerns
about security surrounding the
tests, scheduled a hearing on the
SAT cheatingscandal on Oct. 25 at
Farmingdale State College.
His spokesman said Kurt M.
Landgraf, president and CEO of
Princeton, N.J.-based Education-
al Testing Service, and Gaston
Caperton, president of The Col-
lege Board, are among those who
have been invited to testify at
the committee hearing.

23 crew members
on Italian ship
locked in armored
area since Monday
ROME (AP) - British and U.S.
forces freed an Italian cargo ship
hijacked by Somali pirates in a
dramatic rescue yesterday after
retrieving a message in a bottle
tossed by hostages from a port-
hole alerting ships nearby the
crew was safely sealed inside an
armored area.
All 23 crew members of the
Montecristo cargo ship were
brought to safety, the Italian For-
eign Ministry said. The 11 pirates
were taken into custody.
The' crew - seven Italians,
six Ukrainians and 10 Indians
- locked themselves inside an
armored area of the vessel when
the pirates boarded the ship Mon-
day, Italian Defense Minister
Ignazio La Russa said. Safe from
the pirates threats, the crew con-
tinued to navigate the ship.
"The criminals managed to cut
off all means of communication,
but the 'prisoners' tossed a bottle

with a message through a port-
hole explaining the situation," La
Russa told a news conference.
At that point, other ships in
the area were aware that the Ital-
ian vessel had been boarded by
pirates. But the message in the
bottle gave an important sig-
nal that the 'crew of the Italian
ship was out of harm's way and
that a rescue operation could be
launched without risking injury.
"Rubber boats circled the
Montecristo, while a helicopter
hovered above. The pirates sur-
rendered right away, some throw-
ing their weapons in the sea, and
were arrested," he said.
One crew member sustained a
light hand injury, La Russa said.
The pirates attacked the ship
Monday 620 miles (1,000 kilome-
ters) off Somalia as the crew was
hauling scrap iron to Vietnam on
a journey that had begun Sept. 20
in Liverpool, England.
The father of one of the crew
members, Pietro Raimondo, said
Italian officials had told him that
his son was in good shape.
"We are happy. We are cele-
brating the liberation," said Anto-
nio Raimondo from Sardinia,
the Italian news agency ANSA

reported.
The operation was carried out
by two navy ships - one British
and one American - and coordi-
nated by Italian Adm. Gualtiero
Mattesi as part of NATO's Ocean
Shield anti-piracy force, accord-
ing to the Italian Foreign Minis-
try.
Britain's Defense Ministry said
the RFA Fort Victoria "responded
to calls to assist a pirated Italian
merchant ship, the MV Monte-
cristo, along with an American
Navy frigate." Because of the
presence of warships, the pirates
on board surrendered without
force, it said.
Pirates flourish off largely law-
less Somalia by attacking pass-
ing ships, taking hostages and
demanding ransoms to free them
and the vessels.
Earlier yesterday, La Russa
said security forces - groups of
six armed marines - can be used
as security guards on Italian ships
sailing in perilous waters, noting
that "the danger of piracy has
increased."
International militaries are
increasingly tasking assault teams
with boarding ships and battling
pirates in order to win the release

of hostages.
In April this year, a Danish
assault team freed 18 hostages
after boarding a vessel off Soma-
lia's coast. Three pirates were
wounded.
Only 10 days later South
Korean commandos stormed a
container ships and freed the
21 crew on board. In May Indo-
nesian forces killed four Somali
pirates after the hostage-takers
were paid a ransom and freed
hostages.
But for every successful attack
against hostage-taking pirates,
far more pirates make it back to
Somalia with their hostages in
hand. A Danish yachting family of
five was taken by pirates in Febru-
ary from their 43-foot (13-meter)
yacht. The family was released
last month.
And one attempted rescue of
four hijacked Americans abroad
their private yacht went horri-
bly wrong in February when the
pirates killed the four as U.S.
naval ships shadowed the yacht.
Pirates hold at least 10 ships
and 251 hostages, according to
Cmdr. Harrie Harrison of the
anti-piracy military coalition
European Union Naval Force.

Obama requests
funding for Great
Lakes restoration
At a time when many govern-
ment programs are fighting for
survival, there's one place the
money is still flowing for now: the
Great Lakes.
In the past two years, Congress
has pumped $775 million into the
Great Lakes Restoration Initia-
tive, a plan to deal with prob-
lems scientists say could turn the
world's largest freshwater system
into an ecological wasteland:
industrial pollution, invasive
species, an unraveling food web,
watersheds fouled by massive
algae blooms, disappearing wild-
life habitat.
President Barack ' Obama
requested an additional $350
million in his 2012 budget, but
nothing is certain with lawmak-
ers deeply divided over spending.
The future is even murkier, wor-
rying supporters who say big cash
infusions will be needed for many
years to heal the ailing freshwa-
ter seas and the streams that feed
them.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala.
Workers protest
Alabama illegal
immigration law
Poultry plants that employ
thousands are planning to close
or scale back operations because
of a work stoppage being pro-
moted by Hispanic residents and
their supporters to protest Ala-
bama's tough new law against
illegal immigration.
Pilgrim's Pride Corp. and
Alatrade Foods each planned to
shutter one plant in north Ala-
bama today because of the pro-
test, and Tyson Foods said it was
limiting production at two plants
because of a potential shortage of
workers.
Margaret McDonald, a spokes-
woman for the Colorado-based
Pilgrim's Pride, said Hispanic
workers at its plant in Boaz told
managers they didn't want to
work so they could "stand in soli-
darity" with their community.
NEW YORK, N.Y.
Former Soviet
military officer
faces weapons trial
A jury has been selected to
hear the arms sale trial of a Soviet
military officer known as the
Merchant of Death.
Opening statements in the trial
of Viktor Bout (boot) were sched-
uled to start this morning. The
jury was chosen yesterday. Pro-
spective jurors were questioned
to make sure they would not be
bothered by a trial that discussed
weapons bought and sold around
the world.

The 44-year-old Bout has
pleaded not guilty to charges.that
carry a potential life sentence.
He was arrested in 2008 in Thai-
land after a sting operation by the
Drug Enforcement Administra-
tion. He was extradited to the
United States late last year over
the objections of the Russian gov-
ernment.
BOGOTA, Colombia
Colombia won't

President Juan Manuel Santos

Palestinian leader that Colombia
will only recognize a Palestinian
state that has been established
through negotiations with Israel.
Colombia's has a vote on the
U.N. Security -Council, which is
considering the Palestinian bid
for statehood. Santos hasn't said
whether Colombia will abstain
or vote "no." The U.S. has threat-
ened toveto the statehood appeal.
Palestinian President Mah-
moud Abbas said in. a joint
appearance with Santos yester-
day that there is no contradiction
between negotiations and the
Security Council bid.

that GSRAs are students, not
employees, at the regents' meet-
ing in May, and 18 University
deans wrote a letter to Univer-
sity Provost Philip Hanlon in
June sharing the same senti-
ment.
At last night's meeting, Mont-
gomery said GSRAs are reach-
ing out across the University
community to garner support
on the issue because many of
the research assistants are in
favor of a union formation but
are lacking the freedom to orga-
nize one. In August, MERC
ruled that GSRAs at the Uni-
versity cannot unionize due to
a 1981 state law prohibiting the
action.
Montgomery said there are
countless reports of intimida-
tion by supervisors, who have
told GSRAs not to unionize,
which she thinks is unaccept-
able behavior.
While the assembly dis-
cussed this issue in the past,
MSA President DeAndree Wat-
son said the official introduc-
tion of a resolution would come
on Oct. 25 when the assembly
will take a stance.
MSA TALKS POTENTIAL
CHANGES TO MEETING
PROCEDURES
The assembly also discussed
a resolution that would amend
the current operating proce-
dures at meetings and define
public speakers' rights.

The resolution was comment-
ed on during the community
concerns portion of the meeting
by Mozhgan Savabieassfahan,
who did post-doctoral research
at the University. Savabieass-
fahan voiced her disapproval
of the resolution because she
said it could prohibit freedom
of expression. She said she
believes people should be able
to say whatever they feel in the
public comment section of the
meeting, regardless if it is dis-
agreeable to some students.
The resolution was presented
in response to concerns that
some of the speakers' comments
may be offensive to some of the
representatives. Watson cited
prior meetings in which.issues
addressed made attendees vis-
ibly upset.
He added that implementing
a policy would ensure the "pro-
fessionalism of the student gov-
ernment."
ASSEMBLY DISCUSSES
REPRESENTATIVES'
ATTENDANCE
Following these discus-
sions, Speaker of the Assem-
bly Matthew Eral noted that
many representatives are close
to exceeding their 12 allotted
absences. Eral said representa-
tives are elected by the student
population and that failing to
carry out their duties is a dis-
service to the community.
"Try to remember that you
are elected," Eral said. "This
isn't just joining a student org.
You're serving the students who
elected you."

LOS ANGELES (AP) - A
19-month civil rights investiga-
tion of the Los Angeles Unified
School District found that the
district failed to provide anequal
education to English-learners
and black students, resulting in
wide academic disparities, the
U.S. Department of Education
announced yesterday.
The district, the nation's
second-largest, agreed to rem-
edy the disparities through a
variety of measures, including a
complete overhaul of its English-
learningprogram and improving
resources such as computers and
library books to schools with
predominantly black student
bodies.
U.S. Education Secretary
Arne Duncan, who unveiled the
agreement at a news conference
at LAUSD headquarters, said it
would help ensure that every
student in the nation's second

largest school district would
receive the same academic
opportunities "regardless of race
or national origin."
Noting that these issues are
"incredibly complex and politi-
cally charged," Duncan said he
was encouraged by the district's
sense of urgency and willingness
to voluntarily remedy the dis-
parities without an order.
"Though we still have a long
way to go before we see that
English learner students and
African-American students are
consistently getting what they
need to perform up to their
fullest potential, I'm confident
today's agreement will help
address the causes of concern
that prompted our review," he
said.
Duncan stopped short of say-
ing that students' civil rights
were violated and did not reveal
detailed results of the inves-
tigation, just the terms of the
agreement. But the Education
Department said in a statement
that it will monitor the district's
compliance with the agreement
until educational codes are met.
The agreement was the result
of a "compliance review" by the

Education Department's Office
of Civil Rights, which was con-
cerned about wide achievement
gaps between the district's low-
est performing student groups
and other students.
Only 5 percent of high school
English language learners
ranked as proficient in either
English or math; for black stu-
dents, 32 percent ranked as pro-
ficient in English and 9 percent
in math, according to the dis-
trict's 2009-10 report card.
The overall district average
was 37 percent proficient in Eng-
lish and 17 percent in math.
LAUSD Superintendent John
Deasy said the district did not
dispute that disparities exist and
worked to hammer out a solu-
tion with federal officials. The
district will be studying how to
fund the measures as plans for
specific areas are developed.
The district's English-lan-
guage learning program has
long been criticized for allowing
non-native speakers to remain
in English-learning programs
for years, sometimes through-
out their school careers, never
meeting the criteria to move into
mainstream classes.

Israel approves
prisoner-swap
deal with Hamas

Terror group will
return Israeli
soldier for 1,000
Palestinians
JERUSALEM (AP) - In a
much-anticipated prisoner
exchange that could have broad
implications, Israel and Hamas
announced yesterday that an
Israeli soldier abducted to Gaza
five years ago would be swapped
for about 1,000 Palestinians
held by Israel and accused of
militant activity.
Israel's government approved
the deal early today follow-
ing a three-hour debate after
both Israeli Prime Minis-
ter Benjamin Netanyahu and
Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal
announced the agreement in
televised comments.
Netanyahu said the cap-
tured soldier, Sgt. Gilad Schalit,
would return home within days.
Mashaal, portraying the agree-

ment as a victory, said the Pales-
tinian prisoners would be freed
in two stages over two months.
Hamas and Israel are bitter
enemies. Hamas has sent doz-
ens of suicide bombers into Isra-
el, killing hundreds, and Israel
blockaded Gaza after Hamas
seized power there in 2007, car-
rying out a large-scale invasion
in 2009 to try to stop daily rock-
et attacks on Israel. More than
1,500 Gaza Palestinians have
been killed in Israeli raids and
airstrikes since the soldier was
captured.
In the northern Gaza-town of
Jebaliya, thousands of Hamas
supporters flocked the streets,
led by masked militants. Cars
with loudspeakers played.praise
for Hamas. Thousands of other
Gazans rushed to their border
with Egypt, clutching Palestin-
ian and Egyptian flags, tossing
flowers and cheering.
Gaza's Hamas prime minis-
ter, Ismail Haniyeh, smiled as
he threw candy to celebrating
backers.

U.S. mission launched to
find oil on sunken tanker

Divers search for
vessel to prevent
crude oil leak
LOS ANGELES (AP) - The
SS Montebello was just a few
miles off California's Central
Coast on a December morn-
ing in 1941 when a young look-
out spotted the dark outline of
a Japanese submarine headed
straight for the oil tanker haul-
ing 3 million gallons of crude.
Richard Quincy saw a small
spark in the dawn's early light,
followed by an explosion as a
torpedo rocked the ship and
showered the bridge in water.
"It started going down right
away," Quincy, now 92, told The
Associated Press. "We couldn't
figure out why it wasn't burn-
ing. That was the scary part
until they started shooting at us
and then it got scarier."
Quincy is the last remaining
survivor of the largely forgot-
ten attack two weeks after Pearl
Harbor that could still have sig-
nificant environmental implica-
tions. The ecological disaster
following last year's Gulf of
Mexico spill drove officials to
find out how much oil remains
in the hold of the 440-foot ship
to determine how to prevent the
crude from leaking and marring
the celebrated California coast-
line.
"If 3 million gallons of oil
made its way to the beaches in
front of Hearst Castle it would
be a disaster for the area," said
Andrew Hughan, a spokes-
man with California's Fish and
Game Department.

Divers along with a remotely
operated underwater vehicle
will begin their assessment
today and take samples, a pro-
cess that is expected to take as
many as 12 days. Officials have
video and photos from previous
dives, but this is the first time
technological advancements
will allow them to recover oil
samples from the tanks.
While it's possible the
oil leaked out over the past
decades, officials say crude like-
ly remains in the hull. By this
point, the oil is so old it likely
has the consistency of peanut
butter, said U.S. Coast Guard
spokesman Adam Eggers.
"No one knows what 70-year-
old oil does," he said. "It's 40
degrees down there. Is it going
to rise to the surface, warm up
and liquefy or it is going to be a
rock?"
The Montebello set out from
Port San Luis, Calif., on Dec.
22, 1941, bound for a refinery in
Canada with fresh crude.
Quincy said it was the sec-
ond such trip they had taken
and had been warned that Jap-
anese submarines were in the
area. The torpedo hit the ship's
bow, which cracked off when
the Montebello hit the ocean
floor.
Quincy had just pointed
out the sub when the torpedo
exploded. Mariners jolted from
their sleep scrambled in the
winter cold to get in lifeboats.
"It was cloudy and a little
misty and there. was a wind
blowing," Quincy said. "It was
pretty miserable. Particularly
for some of them who didn't
have anything but their under-

wear on."
All 38 aboard were rescued
after rowing away from the hail
of bullets.
"I was real scared," Quincy
said. "We thought it might catch
fire because we were carrying a
volatile product."
The Montebello, meanwhile,
has been sitting upright ever
since 900 feet below the surface
about six miles off Cambria.
Murky pictures from previous
dives show a ship partially cov
ered in a thick coat of barnacles,
starfish and marine debris.
Few knew about the Monte-
bello's fate even immediately
after it sank. Fearing a mass
panic that the Japanese had
gotten so close to shore, the
government confiscated news-
paper reports about the sinking
at the time and did not publicly
disclose the event even into the
Cold War, said Eggers.
In fact, Japanese submarines
operated along the U.S. West
Coast, although they did not
sink the large numbers of ships
that German U-boats claimed
along the East Coast and Gulf of
Mexico. In addition to the Mon-
tebello, two other tankers were
sunk on the coast off Oregon
and Crescent City, Calif.
Among other famous World
War II attacks in the American
theater, submarines shelled a
Califorhia oil field and an Ore-
gon military installation, and
a float plane dropped incendi-
ary bombs in the woods near
Brookings, Ore. Japan also
launched thousands of bomb-
laden balloons across the Pacif-
ic in a largely failed attempt to
set American forests ablaze.

Evidence is essential
'U' should remove interim misconduct policy
The University's Statement of Student Rights and Responsi-
bilities, issued by the Office of Student Conflict Resolution, is
responsible for addressing issues of stalking, sexual assault,
hazing and inappropriate behavior among students. However, a recent
amendment to the Statement that lowers the burden of proof for accu-
sations of sexual misconduct may actually threaten the rights of stu-
dents. The interim policy recently put into place by the University is
not a proper change and may lead to students being wrongly accused

of sexual misconduct.
The amendment could, in certain situa-
tions, admit hearsay evidence in cases of sexual
harassment, which means students could more
easily be implicated in sexual misconduct. The
current policy is an interim mandate and it
needs to be removed immediately. If the Uni-
versity wanted to change the policy regarding
sexual misconduct accusations, it should have
done so by first seeking proper approval from
the Senate Advisory Committee on University
Affairs, the lead faculty governing body, and the
Michigan Student Assembly - the two bodies
that must approve amendments to the student
code. Moving forward, the University should
return to its previous policy written in the code.
Last week, Suellyn Scarnecchia, the Uni-
versity's vice president and general counsel,
and E. Royster Harper, vice president for stu-
dent affairs, announced the interim procedure
that will be implemented to comply with the
U.S. Department of Education's Title IX rec-
ommendations. The old procedure required
accusers to present "clear and convincing evi-
dence" before an investigation into alleged
sexual misconduct. The guideline meant that
a defendant would be held responsible if it was
"highly probable or reasonably certain that the
sexual harassment occurred." Now, the inter-
im procedure requires only a preponderance of
evidence, in which officials only need to deter-
mine that "it is more likely than not that sexual
harassment or violence occurred."
The policy's main flaw is that individuals
bringing forth allegations ofsexual misconduct
only need to persuade OSCR that "it is more
likely than not" that misconduct occurred.
The ambiguity of the new policy could lead to

unfair interpretation of a situation based on
questionable evidence. The consequences for a
student found guilty of misconduct range from
a formal reprimand to a suspension or expul-
sion from the University.
In December 2009, SACUA recommended
MSA amend the student code and apply the
"preponderance of evidence" standard to the
entire Statement, rather than just the sexual
misconduct policy. After initially backing the
recommendation, MSA eventually withdrew
its support because the lower standard of evi-
dence applied to atoo broad range of offenses,
and MSA felt some of the offenses necessitated
a more rigid burden of proof.
It's strange that the University selected only
issues of sexual misconduct for the implemen-
tation of this new policy. If University officials
truly wish to change the standard of evidence
required to bring forth allegations of miscon-
duct - which isn't advisable - they should apply
this change to all issues discussed in the SSRR.
The University should work to educate stu-
dents on dealing with issues of sexual miscon-
duct if they occur, rather than imposing the
interim policy. Students should be told about
methods of gathering evidence for reporting a
claim, who to speak to if an incident occurs and
what resources are available to them to ensure
the process is handled properly.
While sexual misconduct should never be
taken lightly, the University has a responsibil-
ity to protect both the accuser and the accused
until an impartial judgment has been reached.
The University should remove this interim
policy andrevertbackto its "clear and convinc-
ing" standard of evidence guideline.

What perceptions do you
have of students in the
Business School? What
comes to mind
when you think
of students
studying social
justice?
From my place
in the social jus-
tice sphere, the
Business School
has attained a NORA
negative stigma. STEPHENS
I constantly hear
comments from
my classmates about the school's
elitism. Remarks like "Ross students
have a sole, shallow focus on making
money" or "they have no interest in
helping the unprivileged," rule the
air. At a glance, many of these com-
mentsappearwarranted.With amas-
sive, $145 million building, the school
seems to prioritize glitz and glam,
which many social justice students
would agree is not a main concern.
Ross has been unresponsive to
social justice initiatives on campus
as well. Officials from the school
have never requested a Common-
Ground workshop - a program of
the Program on Intergroup Rela-
tions - to facilitate conversations
about social inequalities. Even hard
science schools, including the Col-
lege of Engineering and the School of
Information, have sponsored these
dialogues. Or consider Ross limiting
the speed of Internet in its building
to non-business students? Block me
out - really? That screams elitism.
I discussed these questions with

Business junior Dan Morse. From
Morse's experience, the vast major-
ity of BBA students focus little on
issues of social justice. When Morse
quizzed Business School students
on their knowledge of basic social
justice terms, like "social construc-
tion," a majority of responses were
"What is that?" or "hmm?" Many
people didn't seem to care.
He believes this lack of interest
makes sense. The school allows cor-
porations to host impressive recruit-
ing events - several catered in the
Big House and even one thatbrought
former Olympic athletes to talk
about "following your dreams" -
making it easy for Business students
to fixate on these opportunities and
forget social justice altogether.
On a different note, maybe social
justice students are too quick to
judge. Upon inspection, many
Business School organizations are
focusedonsocial awareness - Mich-
igan Business Women encourages
discussion on issues women encoun-
ter in business, the Social Venture
Fund invests $50,000 to $250,000
in businesseswith measurable social
impact and MReach brings Detroit
and other Southeast Michigan high
school students to Ross for action-
based learning experiences.
Academically, the school offers
classes such as Business Information
Technology 445 Base of the Pyra-
mid: Business Innovation for Solving
Society's Problems, Business Infor-
mation Technology 444 Introduc-
tion to Microfinance which provide
financial services to the poor and
other classes to explore corporate

social responsibility, These clubs,
classes and a general business edu-
cation give students skills to build
and sustain an organization - some-4
thing lacking from the non-profit
sector and possibly from social jus-
tice students. Maybe there is room
for socially conscious students in the
Business School after all.
Are Ross students
above helping the
community?
Even with these opportunities,
most Business students choose to
work in the corporate world, while
many social justice-minded fresh-4
men don't think of applying to the
Business School as an undergradu-
ate. These two worlds at the Univer-
sity remain quite separate. So what
led to this divide? Why do we keep
our worlds separate? Is it personal?
Is it institutional? Are students from
either side too quick to judge? Are
these judgments justified? Most
importantly, what steps can we take
to begin bridging the gap?
None of these questions are easily
answered, but we think it's.time for
students to think about them.

iel Morse, a junior in the Ross School

Drawing the confrontation line,

TIMOTHY RABB I
Make abortion obsolete

I'll forever remember holding my friend
*Maggie's hand because her delinquent, drug-
addled boyfriend wasn't there to do it. I held it
in the car on the way to the shuttered clinic, in
the admitting room while we waited for the cli-
nician and during the ultrasound as the nurse
ran the sensor along Maggie's belly in search of
the second heart that beat inside her.
I wish I could've been by her side during her
second and final appointment the following
week, but the nurses told me I wasn't allowed to
be present for the procedure, so I sat once more
in the admitting room, watching the incoming
patients and the men that accompanied them.
I was only 17-years old, certain at the time
abortion was one of those moral "grey areas"
about which I had no right to opine. But four
years of inner debate and a week of emotionally
charged protests, editorials and letters to the
editor have convinced me it's worth an attempt.
Though a fetus's "personhood" has been
publicly debated for years, I think the argu-
ment is flawed in that it focuses entirely on the
present state of the fetus. The general assump-
tions both sides make about the sanctity of
human life before birth always seem to reach
a logical impasse. What exactly defines a "per-
son," and what gives that person the rights to
"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?"
That's why Don Marquis, professor of phi-
losophy at the University of Kansas, brought
something new to the table with his 1989 essay
"Why Abortion is Immoral." His essay was
the basis for the "future-like-ours" argument,
which disregards the fetus's present state and
instead focuses on itsfuture potential to become
a human being with the same "experiences,
activities, projects and enjoyments" as our own.
Why do we mourn premature death with
the observation that "(s)he died far too young?"
Marquis's argument addresses this fact of life
with the theory that death is tragic and killing
immoral because "When I die, I am deprived
both of what I now value which would have
been part of my future personal life, but also
what I would have come to value. Therefore,
when I die, I am deprived of all of the value of
my future."
By asserting that life's value lies not only
in the present and past but also in the future,

Marquis sidesteps the question of a fetus's
"personhood" and suggests that a fetus's future
potential to become a human being extends it
the right to life. He does, however, offer excep-
tions for cases involving rape or incest.
While I'm by no means trying to endorse
Marquis's essay as absolute truth, I often won-
der why pro-life supporters resort to grotesque
imagery captioned with inflammatory terms
such as "genocide" and "murder" to get their
point across when there are other more logical,
less offensive options. But even now, more than
20 years after its appearance, I have yet to see a
single public protest or debate make mention of
the "future-like-ours" argument. Curious, con-
sidering it's been a hot tppic among academics
since the day it was published and no one has
satisfactorily disproven it.
Though I'm hesitant to take Marquis's firm
stance on the moral implications of abortion,
I think most of us can agree that it's a tragic
choice for any woman to be faced with. It's
even more troubling when one considers that
most abortions could be prevented by the uni-
versal availability and proper use of birth con-
trol. The most recent statistics from the Allen
Gutmacher Institute show that 46 percent of
women seeking abortions weren't using birth
control during the month of conception. Of
those who used birth control, "76% of pill users
and 49% of condom users report having used
their method inconsistently."
Rather than suggest we outlaw elective
abortion or rail against either the pro-choice or
pro-life camps, I'd rather express the hope that
we'll all someday consider abortion a last resort
to be sought only after all other resources have
been exhausted. Unfortunately, the figures
above show that's presently not the case.
To this day, I regret not trying to talk Maggie
through her decision, to see if she had consid-
ered all her options - but I was too young to
know how. The most I can do now is promise
myself that if I should ever havea daughter, I'll
give her the emotional support that Maggie
never had. No one should have to face such a
critical decision alone.
*Maggie's name has been changed.

I've never been one for confrontation. OK, let me
rephrase - I've never been one forsober confrontation.
Like all my ailments, I blame, it on.my mother. I've
seen the frightened look in countless waiters' eyes as
she boldly rejects the table they've seated us at. Yes, the
booth is minusculely closer to the door than ideal. But is
it really worth vinegar - or something worse - in your
salad dressing?
Maybe it was simply maturation, but I eventually got
over my embarrassment and realized there are reasons
to be respectfully confrontational. If I go to dinner with
a group of students, it's not right for the host to assume
we won't tip well and give us a table next to the bath-
room. I politely ask for another table, very careful to
smile and be much nicer than my mother.
Restaurant etiquette aside, I found myself wrestling
with respectful confrontation in a more controversial
arena. A friend had posted a tad risque Facebook status
- both pro-choice and supporting LGBTQ rights. No
qualms there. The comments, however, took me aback.
An adult woman had commented, "Just because some-
one is against gay marriage doesn't necessarily mean he
is against gay people.:)"
Beside the fact that emoticons are not appropri-
ate over age 14, I was immediately offended. I whole-
heartedly disagree with her statement. I didn't know,
however, if a response was warranted. I don't tolerate
homophobic comments, but this was somewhere on the
edge. Was this homophobic? And more importantly, was
it my place to confront a woman who I didn't know and
would most likely never meet? Is Facebook an appropri-
ate forum for this kind of sensitive discussion?
I initially wrote a typical, fiery, liberal response, took
a deep breath and deleted it. Instead I wrote: "I have to
disagree." Short, respectful and lacking and backbone or
argument. Even as I posted it, I became the 9 year old,
embarrassed and whispering, "Mom, this table is fine!"
I figured my one-sentence response would end my
involvement in the thread. The woman, however, con-
tinued the conversation. "To some, changing the defi-
nition of marriage would be like changing the law of
gravity," she said on the thread. Someone else pointed
out that gravity is a description of a force in reality - an
explanation of a pre-existing phenomenon - while mar-
riage is an unfixed human construct. It was worded well
and, again, respectful.
The woman, pointing outthe civility of the discussion
and apt to keep it going, said that marriage isn't simply a

social construct, "buta human good with certain inher-
ent requirements."
The first tine it had been easy to shake off. This
wasn't. I was conflicted whether to make a substantial
response or not. She was still being respectful, but it was
challenging to respond in a non-threatening manner.
I responded with my agreement. Marriage is a human
good with certain inherent requirements; including love,
consent and not much else. It's a human good I would like
to be a part of someday - or tomorrow, Zooey Descha-
nel, whenever is convenient for you. Beyond the "human
good" aspect, I pointed outthatthe legal structure isvital
as well for hospital visitation rights and taxbenefits.
The woman pointed out in one sentence that it was
possible for non-heterosexual couples to attain these
rights. At this point, it was all she could do to rein-
force her argument without saying something blatantly
homophobic, which she had clearly been avoiding to
keep a civil tone. I knew this and went in for a confron-
tational kill.
In about 20 states, there are waysto attain most of the
legal rights that a heterosexual married couple has. But,
I responded, by doing so I affirm that Im not allowed the
same "human good with certain inherent requirements"
that heterosexual couples are. Therefore, I affirm that I
am less of a human - less deserving of a "human good"
- than a heterosexual. I'm not. I'm firm and unwavering
in that conviction, regardless of what side of the issue
she or anyone else is on.
She apologized for offending me, but had I taken the
previously polite conversation too far? Was I too con-
frontational? Haven't I learned about the importance of
respectful dialogue in every sociology class?
In the end, there are some things that no amount of
political correctness can sugarcoat. Yes, asking for a dif-
ferent table with nice tone probably saves me from spit
in my Coke, but calling millions of conscious, produc-
tive and, sexuality aside, normal people less than human
with polished language and smiles doesp't change your
thesis. There are times when civility should be thrown
aside, when respectful forcefulness with rational and
intellectual argument is necessary. As uncomfortable
the confrontation may be, we must say: "You are infring-
ing upon my rights and dignity. I cannot stand by idly
and let you continue."

Reeling from the tragic mis-
carriage of their son, Vivien
(Connie Britton, "Friday Night
Lights") and Ben Harmon (Dylan
McDermott, "The Practice")
seek a fresh start in Los Ange-
les with teenage daughter Vio-
let (relative newcomer Taissa
Farmiga). However, the family
dynamic quickly disintegrates.
Unable to forgive her husband for
sleeping with one of his students,
Vivien becomes cold and distant,
choosing instead to find compan-
ionship in a new dog.
Resentful of this rejection, Ben
represses his urge to release his
sexual frustration by remaining
"closer to the family" through
his at-home psychiatry practice.
Violet is aware of the tension
between her parents, and iso-
lates herself socially, adopting
the apathetic stance of a modern-
day Wednesday Addams. Within
the first week, strange neighbors
and macabre hallucinations work
their way into the old house,
re-hashing the family's inner
demons while providing a haunt-
ing past of their own.

STONES TH ROW

In last season's final episode
of "South Park," tellingly titled
"You're Getting Old," the cre-
ators effec-
tively showed
viewers they
know they've South Park
been on the air
for a long 14 Season 15
years. As Stan Midseason

of comedy, literally. His disease,
being "a cynical asshole," quick-
ly became an apparent metaphor
for the state of "South Park"
creators Trey Parker and Matt
Stone, who must have become a
little jaded and worn down cre-

year. The season ended on a per-
plexingly serious note, as Stan's
parents get a divorce while the
rest of the gang stops hang-
ing out with Stan because he's
such a bummer. It was unclear
where the show would go, with
the series's creators seemingly
admitting to getting too old for
this shit (soto speak).
Luckily, the new crop of epi-
sodes shows there's still life
in "South Park" as the writers
experiment with both tone and
viewer expectations. The pre-
miere walks a tightrope between
self-seriousness and absur-
dity that's fascinating to watch
unfold. Season 15 picks up with
Stan still completely unhappy
and living in his divorced mom's
new condo, pleadingto his coun-
selor that he just wants to go
back the way it was.
The show once again seems

COUZENS
From Page 1A
Life Initiatives has undertaken
a number of projects to improve
residence halls. One of the initia-
tives includes the North Quad
Residential and Academic Com-
plex that opened last fall and cost

about $175 million to build. Stock-
well and Mosher-Jordan resi-
dence hall were also renovated
in recent years at a cost of $39.6
million and $44.1 million, respec-
tively. Additionally, renovations
are underway at Alice Lloyd Resi-
dence Hall, and East Quad Resi-
dence Hall will be revamped next
school year.

Coleman talked about how
each residence hall has its own
character and praised the renova-
tions for retaining "the best tradi-
tion of Michigan." She added that
the older University buildings are
well constructed, but they need
to be renovated to meet students'
changing needs.
"They needed updating, they

needed to be modernized, they
needed the latest in technology
because (that's) the way our stu-
dents learn today," Coleman said.
"And so it's a thrill for us to keep
the infrastructure, keep the beau-
tiful parts of the building and yet
make them as modern as any new
building could be."
Engineering senior Ricqel

Smith lived in Couzens before the
renovations and now serves as a
peer academic success special-
ist in the building. Smith said she
was shocked and impressed by
the new facility.
"It definitely was mind blowing
" Smith said. "Looking from the
outside, it doesn't look like they
changed anything, but when you

walk in it's just like this modern-
ized, wonderful building."
Smith added that, she has
already noticed students taking
advantage of the building's ame-
nities.
"Before, you fought over one
study lounge, and now there's just
so many options to choose from,"
she said.

BLOOD BANK
From Page 1A
practice," Kardia said. "People
should know when they're being
a part of research."
LSS Assistant Director Dan-
iel Thiel said students should be
aware of the option to give their
blood for research, especially
because it is not a widely dis-
cussed issue. LSS's mission is to
promote education, research and
community engagement in areas
related to the life sciences. A part
of that mission is to educate the

public about what people can do
with their blood samples.
"We're concerned about the
way that the public perceives the
way that science moves forward,
and we're also concerned about
making sure that science is done
in an ethical manner," Thiel said.
"We're interested in educating
the public about it and also look-
ing and testing new ways to think
about what consent means for a
large biobank like this."
The blood is initially collected
for the newborn screening test,
which is a test required by the
state that screens for 49 disor-

ders that would require early
treatment. Because the test is
required by state law, no parental
consent is necessary. According
to the Michigan Department of
Community Health, the newborn
screening test finds more than
200 babies born in Michigan each
year have one of the listed disor-
ders.
When the blood is collected
from newborns, leftover dime-
sized samples are placed on paper
cards, which are then stored in
the BioTrust. When the samples
are moved to the bank, they are
unidentified so that no personal

information is attached to them.
At town hall meetings and
other discussions LSS has held,
Thiel said people ask many ques-
tions to understand the logistics
of the program and why research-
ers are asking permission to
use the blood now when it isn't
required for the newborn screen-
ing test.
"One of the big things that
we've seen is confusion between
the newborn screening program
and the BioTrust research which
is really separate," Thiel said.
"(The research is) after the new-
born screening is over."

In 2010, LSS received a five-
year National Institutes of Health
grant that it plans to use to lead
discussions to see what the public
thinks about the ethics involved
with the BioTrust.
Kardia has been doing genetic
research and said the BioTrust
blood is a valuable resource.
"I think it's a really unique
opportunity because there's no
other resource in the United
States that actually has every
single person in a state-born in
that state-curated for potential
research," Kardia said. "Every-
thing else is biased by the way

we sample it when we do the
research."
However, even though no con-
sent is required for the blood to
be used, Kardia said it is impor-
tant for the researchers to ask.
As a researcher, Kardia could use
the blood to further her stud-
ies, but as a mother, she said
she understands why consent is
important.
"I'm a geneticist, and genetic
information is awfully person-
al," Kardia said. "I don't want
to do genetic studies on people
who don't know I'm doing those
genetic studies."

THIS & THAT
From Page 1A
that needs to be addressed. Russ
Collins, executive director of
the Michigan Theater, hired a
security guard for the area in
part because of the panhandling.
However, he added that the hir-
ing was not out of the ordinary.
"(Panhandling) is part of the
downtown landscape," Collins
said.
Collins also went to other busi-
nesses on East Liberty asking for
financial contributions to help
pay for the security guard. But
Graef said This & That did not
help cover the costs because the
security guard was for the graf-
fiti alley, which This & That isn't

directly next to.
"The panhandling that was
bothering one was the stuff in
front of my store, so I'm not
inclined to pay someone to help
for a security guard," Graef said.
Ann Arbor City Council mem-
ber Sabra Briere (D-Ward 1) said
though she doesn't think pan-
handling is causing poor sales in
the area, increased panhandling
is a problem that needs to be
addressed. But she said, regret-
fully, the city does not have
enough funds to hire more police
officers at this time.
"We don't have a lot of flex-
ibility when it comes to spending
money for either providing ser-
vices to people who are homeless
or for putting more police on the
street," Briere said.

City Council recently request-
ed a grant of federal funds given
to the state of Michigan to hire
more police officers. The city is
also working to develop different
staffing methods to station more
current officers in the downtown
area.
Though Collins said he couldn't
determine if there has recently
been an increased number of
panhandlers on East Liberty, he
believes the issue is exaggerated
by the media.
"(The coverage) plays on peo-
ple's fears and anxieties," he said.
Other stores in the area are
also slated to close soon. Graef's
announcement comes 10 days
after Poshh owner Wendy-Batiste
Johnson said her clothing bou-
tique on East Liberty is expected

to close on Oct. 30.
Graef cited the closing of
Borders as a major catalyst in
decreasing foot traffic and sales
on East Liberty.
"When I did my business plan,
(Borders) had 7,000 people on
average a week through their
doors - those people are gone,"
Graef said. "It's going to impact
an area."
She added that the increase
in corporate franchises, such as
CVS, in the area has impacted
local business, since independent
stores like hers aren't able to com-
pete with corporate competition.
Graef said the personal and
unique experience independent
businesses in Ann Arbor create
for customers is lost when corpo-
rate businesses move in.

"The beauty of Ann Arbor is
that everything was indepen-
dent," she said.
For Graef, closing her store isn't
easy. She said opening This & That
was a dream of hers and was very
rewarding, even with the strug-
gles she faced. She added that
leaving her loyal customer base
will be difficult, but she knows the
store cannot remain open.
"I've had alot of great support,
a lot of people coming to see me
these last few weeks and telling
me that they're very sad ... so that
makes me feel good and bad at the
same time," Graef said. "I feel like
I've let the community down by
closing, but there's only so much
you can do if the sales are not
coming in to support the store."
With no current plans to

reopen in the future, Graef said
everything in the store, including
the candy supply, has to be sold.
Graef added that she hopes the
area and economy will rebound,
allowing another independent
business owner to have a mean-
ingful experience opening and
their own store.
"I think it will turn around ...
I mean, I'm an optimist on that.
I have high hopes for it," Graef
said. "Someone else will-move in,
someone else will try something.
That's the nature of small busi-
nesses - someone keeps trying
their dreams, so we'll see."

NYT
From Page 1A
Though Conlin said she didn't
use her 2002 profile to guide the
new article, there are several over-
laps between the two pieces. Ann
Arbor restaurants such as Zinger-
man's, Dominick's and Angelo's
were included in both articles.

Events like the Farmers Market
in Kerrytown and Football Satur-
days also made each article, as did
picturesque campus spots like the
Diag and Law Quad.
Mary Kerr, president and CEO
of the Ann Arbor Area Convention
and Visitors Bureau, said the arti-
cle "is absolutely huge" and wrote
in a separate e-mail interview that
it has the potential to draw visitors

to Ann Arbor and help boost the
local economy.
"It gives us national publicity
as a great place to visit and a great
weekend destination," Kerr said.
While the article didn't turn
Ann Arbor into a tourist hotspot
overnight, the story has affected
some of the businesses mentioned,
including Angelo's on Catherine
Street.

"We had a few people mention
it to us," said Angelo's owner Steve
Vangelatos. "A lot of people read
The New York Times. They notice
it, and they mention it."
Another business written about
in the article, Mark's Carts - an
open-air collection of food carts
located on West Washington
Street that opened in May - has
also been featured ip other nation-

al publications including the Chi-
cago Tribune which wrote about
it last week. Despite the public-
ity of the courtyard, Marks Carts
owner Mark Hodesh said the carts
haven't yet achieved a big student
following.
"I don't get the sense that peo-
ple come in droves from campus,
eat and go back," Hodesh said.
Originally, Conlin wanted to

include more attractions, but had
to exclude some famous locales
such as Blimpie Burger, Fleetwood
Diner and the Blind Pig. Conlin
said she hoped to say more about
the city in the article, but "there's
only a certain amount of space."
And with only 36 hours,
Conlin said, "You're actually
supposed to come up with (a
realistic) itinerary."

Lynch's back spasms
spark lineup shifts
for No. 5 Michigan

MARISSA MCCLAIN/Daily
Fifth-year senior defensive end Ryan Van Bergen thinks he bears a peculiar resemblance to mythical lumberjack Paul Bunyan. Some teammates aren't convinced.
Seniors look to redefine legacy

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
For the Michigan football
team, success is measured in Big
Ten championship rings and
rivalry-game victories over Ohio
State and Michigan State.
The senior class, then, is star-
ing failure right in the face.
After three consecutive sea-
sons with losses to both the Spar-
tans and Buckeyes, the senior
Wolverines are in danger of
becoming the first class in Michi-
gan football history to record four
consecutive losses against each of
their two bitter rivals.
"Rightnow, the legacy withthe
seniors in my class is that we're
going to have to come back and
say we've lost to Michigan State
three years in a row, and none of
us have beaten Ohio State," said
senior defensive end Ryan Van
Bergenon Monday.
"That's our legacy - like it
or not - good, bad or indiffer-
ent. Luckily, we have this year to
change some of that, and that's
our focus going forward."
Michigan (2-0 Big Ten, 6-0
overall) has another chance to
right the ship on Saturday, with
the 59th edition of the battle for
the Paul Bunyan Trophy, a four-
foot high wooden statue present-
ed each year to the winner of the
Michigan-Michigan State rivalry
game.
The trophy, established in
Michigan State's first season in
the Big Ten in 1953 by then-gov-
ernor G. Mennen Williams, has

been in the Spartans' possession
since 2008.
As Michigan's seniors attempt
to revitalize their legacy, Michi-
gan coach Brady Hoke hopes to
continue laying the foundation
for his tenure in Ann Arbor -
something his predecessor, Rich
Rodriguez, failed to do.
A sterling 6-0 record for Hoke
and Co. isn't a bad way to start.
But this will be the stiffest test
yet - he's had a clock in Schem-
bechler Hall counting down to
Saturday's kickoff in East Lansing
since February.
Former Michigan coach Ben-
nie osterbaan was the last head
coach to beat the Spartans (1-0,
4-2) in his firstyear at the helm of
the Wolverines.
That was in 1948.
"(This game) means an awful
lot," Hoke said. "It means a lot
because we represent a great uni-
versity. We've gotcgreat alums out
there, and it's a Big Ten game, and
it's an important game.
"It's a tremendous rivalry in
college football. You can say on a
local, state, regional standpoint
but also a national standpoint. It's
Michigan-Michigan State."
It's a battle for so much more
than a wooden trophy. It's the
redefinition of a legacy for a class
and a coach at Michigan.
RYAN VAN BUNYAN: The Paul
Bunyan Trophy was named in
obvious reference to the mythi-
cal lumberjack Paul Bunyan. The
name represented Michigan's
history as a lumber-producing
state.

But the trophy bears a resem-
blance to a certain Michigan
defensive lineman.
"Are you talking about me?"
Van Bergen asked.
Well, yes. Throw on a cap, roll
up the sleeves and puff out your
chest, Ryan - voili.
"I've drawn comparisons to
the Paul Bunyan Trophy," Van
Bergen said, laughing. "I think I
might have to shave my beard or
something.
"And I have to stop carrying
my axe around."
Maybe it makes sense that the
Whitehall, Mich. native is the one
drawing the comparisons.
Van Bergen's hometown of
Whitehall was originally named
Mears, Mich.afterCharles Mears,
a lumber baron who developed
much of Michigan's West side.
"Oh God, don't support his
ego," said fifth-year center David
Molk when asked about the
resemblance between Van Bergen
- his roommate - and Bunyan.
COLORING INSIDE THE
(STATE) LINES: The legacy of
Michigan State's seniors has been
the antithesis of Michigan's.
The Spartans are coming off an
11-2 season and a share of the Big
Ten championship. Almost more
importantly, the seniors in East
Lansing also haven't lost to the
Wolverines. That was the plan all
along.
Michigan State quarterback
Kirk Cousins hails from Hol-
land, Mich., just 50 miles down
the Lake Michigan shore from
Van Bergen's hometown. Cousins

remembers arriving in East Lan-
sing as a freshman and. talking
about "painting the state green."
"There is no in between (in
Michigan)," Van Bergen said.
"You either like one or the other."
Spartan junior defensive tackle
Jerel Worthy is from southern
Ohio, but he's placed himself
firmly on one side of Michigan's
great state divide.
Over the summer, Worthy had
a tattoo etched onto his left bicep,
depicting a Spartan warrior
stomping on a wolverine. Though
the wolverine's helmethas a block
'M' on it instead of the traditional
winged design, Worthy certainly
meant to indicate Michigan, not
Missouri.
"The Michigan State fans
know my passion for this rivalry,
they know my passion for this
team and they know I will fight
for this team until the day I die,"
Worthy told reporters at Michi-
gan State Media day.
Emblazoned on the wall of the
Michigan football team's weight
room is a quote from Michigan
State coach Mark Dantonio that
offers all the motivation the Wol-
verines need this week.
"I'm from Ohio, that's why
beating Michigan is such a kick
for me," the bold black font states.
"We will continue to do it ... I
promise you that!"
Dantonio and Michigan State
have done their best to put a dent
in Michigan's 67-31-5 all-time
edge in the rivalry, but as the fall
colors descend on the state, green
just may be fading back to maize.

Injury forces new
forwards into
new spots in
Berenson's lineup
By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Wrifer
Junior forward Kevin
Lynch isn't sure how his injury
occurred. Neither is Michigan
coach Red Berenson.
One thing is certain - some-
time before the No. 5 Michigan
hockey team's first exhibition
game against the Ontario Insti-
tote of. Technology on Oct. 1,
Lynch tweaked his back. It could
have happened in practice, or
maybe he aggravated it in the
weight room.
Whatever the cause, Lynch
didn't recover from it as quickly,
as he or Berenson had hoped.
"(Lynch) was feeling better
after a day or so (but) he tried
it and it was no good," Beren-
son said. "He played in the game
against Ontario, and it was really
sore the next night."
Berenson said back spasms
are so excruciating that it makes
something as simple as tying
shoes painful. With a prognosis
like that; there was little chance
Lynch was going to make an
appearance when Michigan (3-0)
played Bentley last Friday.
He didn't, and since then, the
shuffling of the forward lines
has been like a game of musical
chairs. On Friday, freshman for-
ward Alex Guptill took Lynch's
place in the first line along with
senior forwards Luke Glenden-
ing and David Wohlberg.
Wohlberg moved from his reg-
ular position on the wing to cen-
ter. Although Wohlberg claimed
not to have too much difficulty
adjusting to the change, Beren-
son still wasn't pleased with the
line chemistry.
"Wohlberg's line wasn't
having that good of a game,"
Berenson said after the game on
Friday. "I'm kind of handcuffing
Wohlberg when I put him at cen-
ter. To throw him in there once
in a while istough on him."
So Berenson switched it up
before the third period. Wohl-

berg went back to his more
familiar spot on the wing, and
freshman forward Travis Lynch
took Guptill's place. Playing wing
to junior forward Jeff Rohrkem-
per's center, Travis tallied two
assists, setting up goals for Glen-
dening and senior defenseman
Greg Pateryn.
After Friday, Berenson
believed it was a "definite pos-
sibility," that Kevin Lynch would
play in the second game of the
series.
But the second game came and
went, and once again, Travis was
the only Lynch on the ice.
As far as Kevin is concerned,
Berenson expects him to play
in Thursday's game against SL.
Lawrence. Lynch been skating in
practice this week, but Berenson
won't make a decision regard-
ing Lynch's status until after
Wednesday's practice.
"If I get a good feel (about
Lynch) and he can skate hard,
then he'll play Thursday,"
Berenson said after practice on
Monday. "When you get (back
spasms), you just can't skate
hard. We need him to skate hard
if he's going to play."
But even if Kevin is primed
to play on Thursday, there's no
guarantee he'll even return to
his original line. For now, Beren-
son seems pleased with the Glen-
dening-Travis Lynch-Wohlberg
combination and may not want
to make changes after the trio
registered five points over the
weekend.
Berenson is also anxious to
give freshman forward Andrew
Sinelli playing time, especially
since Sinelli has not seen game
action since an Oct. 3 exhibition
against the US National Team
Development Program due to an
injury sustained before the sea-
son.
Kevin's return would not only
potentially rearrange the first
line but also the subsequent ones.
"If (Kevin) comes in, that
means someone comes out,"
Berenson said. "It could change
one line, and it could change two
lines.
"You're going to see changes
from week-to-week depending
on injuries, who's playing well,
and who we want to get back in
the lineup."

With Morris gone, point guard position a question mark

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Former Michigan point guard
Darius Morris's surprise emer-
gence last season led the Michigan
basketball team all the way to the
second round of the 2011 NCAA
Tournament.
When his buzzer-beating float-
er clanked off the rim in March,
it not only ended the Wolverines'
season, it also
ended Morris's NOTEBOOK
short but suc-
cessful college career, leaving a
vacancy at point guard on this
year's squad.
The void has yet to be filled
and stands as the biggest ques-
tion mark facing a Michigan team
many have tabbed as a Big Ten
title contender. The answer likely
lies in experience, or lack thereof
The Wolverines can either turn
to experience - senior guard Stu
Douglass who has played signifi-
cant minutes at the point but is
better suited as a shooting guard
- or fresh talent in freshmen.
guards Trey Burke and Carlton
Brundidge.
"We catr throw a lot of different
things at teams and not let a team
be able to easily game plan for us,"
said Douglass at Michigan media
day on Tuesday. "We'll be able
to throw some different stuff at
them. We all have different thing's
that we're better at than the other,
and I think that'll be great for us
as a team."
Burke, the reigning Mr. Basket-
ballin Ohio, is considered by many
to be the front-runner to start at
point guard. And while Beilein

conceded that Burke is more of a
natural at the position than Dou-
glass or Brundidge, he remains
cautious.
"We'll have a lot of patience
here," Beilein said. "I think you
have to group Trey with Carlton
because I know so little (about
them).
"Nine hours is all I've spent
with them, and some of that is
really elementary. But Ihave liked,
from both of them, both the early
learning curve and their desire to
become players, their desire to be
coached."
Douglass and his defensive
ability provide an option that the
Wolverines used often last year
- Douglass guarding the point
guard on defense and playing
shooting guard on offense. This
strategy simplifies the defensive
responsibilities, allowing the
freshmen to focus on offense.
Wherever the veteran Douglass
is asked to play, though, he'll be
ready.
"I'm comfortable with going
back and forth, and Sm comfort-
able now with not knowing what
I'm going to play and just going
into a game being ready for wher-
ever coach puts me," Douglass
said.
AN ADVERSE OFFSEASON:
While the future of Michigan bas-
ketball is being stabilized, with
the soon-to-be-opened Player
Development Center, construction
on Crisler Arena made for a hectic
off-season.
The players were forced to work
out at the wrestling facility, prac-
tice at the Intramural Building
and use the locker rooms at Ray

Fisher Stadium, the Wolverines'
baseball field.
"It was tough," Douglass said.
"You didn't have the open gym
available like we were used to.
We had freshmen that we wanted
to show some of the offense to -
really just establish a culture, and
it was tough but we did the best we
possibly could with what we had."
Though the players were sub-
jected to less-than-ideal situa-
tions, the coaches were quick to
credit the senior leadership, senior
guard Zack Novak and Douglass,
with keepingthe team focused.
"They've had to handle adversi-
ty, even in thg offseason, soI think
that's another thing that can pre-
pare us for when the season comes
around," Michigan assistant coach
LaVall Jordan said. "We'll be in
some adverse situations, and guys
have had to communicate over the
summer, had to pull together to
get a goal accomplished. They've
worked at it and had to pull
together to make it happen. ISthink
the team building started earlier,
because of that."
MUSCLE MEN: Crisler Arena
wasn't the only thing under con-
struction in the offseason.
Several players experienced
significant weight gains, most
notably sophomore forward Evan
Smotrycz, who added 36 pounds
since last March.
"It was tough, you had to work
at it," Smotrycz said. "But my mom
- I got to give a lot of credit to her
for cooking all my favorite meals.
But ISput a lot of work in this sum-
mer, and it's been translating on
the court so far."
Sophomore forward Jon Hor-

ford added 25 pounds, making
the once-gaunt big man a legiti-
mate post presence. Along with
Smotrcyz, Horford gives Michi-
gan added depth in the frontcourt
to accompany redshirt sophomore
forward Jordan Morgan.
The front-court players weren't
the only ones to bulk up.
Junior guard Matt Vogrich -
who was generally too small to
match-up against Big Ten guards
two years ago - has steadily
added weight.
"I weigh around 200 pounds
right now, which is like 30 pounds
more than when I came in,"
Vogrich said. "So defensively, stay-
ing in front of people is easier.
"(Strength and conditioning
coach John Sanderson) gave us
all a program to do and I've got a
gym at home that I work out at.
I just stuck to his program and it
worked."

Senior point guard Stu Douglass runs drills at Crisler Arena yesterday.

Like most people of our gen-

social media. I "tweet" and
I "like" as much as anyone else.
In its relatively short time on the
Internet, Facebook has quickly
grown to control nearly every
social facet of our lives. How
many times have you been invited
to an event on Facebook? Do you
call your friends on their birth-
days, or do you just write on their
walls?
About a week ago, I received
a text from a friend from high
school: "Did you unfollow me on
Twitter?!" I had to laugh because
I had in fact "unfollowed" her,
as she had fallen victim to over-
tweeting. "Yes," I replied, to
which she quickly responded,
"I was checking how many fol-
lowers I had this morning and
- noticed that I had one less than
yesterday. Of course it would be

Of course it would be me? Is

about it than I am. I play recre-
ationally. They play professionally.
That's it.
What about beer pong? Do you
think that's a sport?
You know, it really depends. I agree
that there is some finesse in it, but
it's lost so quickly that I don't think
it's a sport.
How are you at beer pong? Are
you only saying that because you
suck, and you're a sore loser?
Um, I actually don't drink, but
when I play quote "water pong"
I'm not very good.
OK. Do you mind me asking why
you don't drink?
No, not at all. It's not really like
- it's more of a personal choice I
guess. My parents didn't drink so
I didn't really grow up in a culture
that had drinks at all. It's really just

one more thing that I'd have to self-
manage and worry about so...
So would you say you have more
fun on Friday nights playing
kickball than everyone else get-
ting wasted?
I would have more fun playing
kickball than getting wasted. I
can certainly imagine some people
would not have more fun play-
ing kickball than getting wasted.
You know, but that's what's sort
of great, we can all make our own
choices.
Have you played against anyone
who was wasted playing kick-
ball?
Yeah, actually we've played against
wasted teams, and they're not fun.
They're not good, and they're bad
sports.
Do you at least beat their asses?
Yeah
<strong>So would you say,
"Don't drink and kick"?
Don't drink and kick. Yeah.
Do you have a kickball slogan?
Well, we're called "The Safety
Monkeys."
That's interesting.
We don't have a slogan though.
OK. Do you have any classes
today?
I have one more class today.
Oh, that sucks. I don't have any
classes, but I don't have any
plans either. No one wants to
hang out with me.

"Wikipedia is not a source" has become
a familiar refrain in academic settings -
but that doesn't stop many students, and
professors, from referencing the crowd-
sourced encyclopedia on a daily basis.
Founded more than 10 years ago in
January of 2001, Wikipedia has revolu-
tionized the way people access informa-
tion across the world. The website, hosted
by the non-profit organization Wikimedia
Foundation Inc., receives on average more
than 530,000 page requests per hour and
is one of the top 10 most visited Internet
sites. Wikipedia's English language ency-
clopedia covers more than 3.75 million
topics, and the site is available in 270 lan-
guages.
What makes Wikipedia unique, while
academically suspect, is its open edit
model. All articles are written collabora-
tively by a large group of anonymous and
unpaid volunteers. This idea that anyone
can edit an article has been the basis of the
"Wikipedia is not a source" mantra that
pervades classrooms.
However, not all scholars agree that
Wikipedia is taboo in academia. Barry
Fishman, associate professor in the School
of Education and the School of Informa-
tion expects his students to use Wikipedia
as a starting point for research.
"It used to be that academics would
kind of sneer at Wikipedia. We'd want
something that was peer reviewed. Turns
out it is peer reviewed. There's just many,
many more peers," Fishman said. "Schol-
ars don't really use encyclopedias anyway,
but a lot of students may start with an
encyclopedia."
Jason Daida, associate research sci-
entist in the University's Space Physics
Research Laboratory and a lecturer in
atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences,
says that Wikipedia can be useful as a first
step in research, but should not be a final
source for an academic paper.
"It's good to get a first reconnaissance,
figure out what's there, but when it comes
down to writing the paper, writing stuff,
you take it with a grain of salt," Daida said.
"We don't recognize it as something that's
citable."
Many University students are used to
routine speeches from instructors who
forbid the use of Wikipedia as a source in
papers. LSA sophomore George Tam said
he uses it as a base of information before
diving into more official research.
"I don't trust it as much as the other

searches that come up. I never use it for-
mally," Tam said.
LSA sophomore Ashley Godin said she
mostly uses Wikipedia to look up informa-
tion unrelated to her classes.
"I'll be looking at something on it, but
then I'll try and go find another source,"
Godin said. "If it's random stuff not related
to anything academic, then I'll look at it."
Even Wikipedia's founder Jimmy Wales
agrees that the online encyclopedia is not a
citable source. He said in a 2005 interview
with Business Week that "people shouldn't
be citing encyclopedias in the first place."
Wale's interview followed a controversy
about a study published in Nature Magazine
in 2005 that found Wikipedia's rate of error
was only slightly greater than Encyclopedia
Britannica's - a finding that Encyclopedia
Britannica contested but Nature refused to
retract. One of Wale's stated goals for Wiki-
pedia is for the website to become as accu-
rate as Britannica or better.
One look at the current most visited
pages on Wikipedia should reassure educa-
tors that the majority of the encyclopedia's
users aren't students looking for a quick
source. The top 10 list includes articles con-
nected to trending topics in news like the
recent death of former Apple CEO Steve
Jobs, "404-Errors," "Facebook," "Sex" and
"Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends" -
all unlikely topics for an academic research
paper.
Wikipedia has several systems to address
and prevent misinformation. Editors -
Wikipedia's term for .anyone who writes
or adds to the site's articles - can report
articles for offenses related to accuracy and
writing style. Disputes over articles can
then be hashed out in Wikipedia's internal
forums, a process which may require arbi-
tration by one of about 1,500 administra-
tors or editors who have achieved a high
position through the approval of their peers
on Wikipedia. The encyclopedia has an
Arbitration Committee of volunteer editors
and administrators with the power to ban
users and regulate more serious violations
of Wikipedia's code.
"The idea that there are lots of people
working on lots of articles that are of inter-
est to them is important, and it creates - in
the end - value that is of equal worth to
more carefully, let's say more deliberately,
curated kinds of resources," Fishman said.
While Wikipedia is, by definition, a work
in progress, it remains a valuable and free
source of information for millions of people

around the world. It contains more than
50 times as many words as the next largest
English language encyclopedia, Encyclope-
dia Britannica.
This mass production of information
is a relatively new form of documenting,
and it hasn't gone unnoticed. The term
"crowdsourcing" refers to a collective and
democratic effort to accomplish a task tra-
ditionally performed by one person. The
word was first used in an article in Wired
Magazine about the phenomenon five years
after Wikipedia began, but now it is com-
monly used to refer to the collective infor-
mation gathering which makes Wikipedia
and similar projects possible.
While Daida is not enthusiastic about
his students using Wikipedia in academic
projects, he uses a Wiki database when
he teaches Engineering 100: Engineer-
ing Design in the Real World. In the class,
students work in teams on projects that
aim to improve quality of life. The search-
able database contains all project reports
from the class since 2002. It uses the same
algorithm as Wikipedia and crowdsources
project ideas so students can continue to
projects from previous semesters without
repeating other students' work or ideas.
"They have a very positive way to look at
what people have done, to build or enhance
what people have done for their own proj-
ect," he said. "It's much more what I expect
of a committee of scholars. You do a refer-
ence look-up, you cite what's been done
before. You follow what trends are most
appealing."
Fishman also said he uses crowdsourc-
ing in his classroom. For each of his classes,
he makes an openly editable Google Docu-
ment so he and his students can create a
set of master notes together. Students are
encouraged to include information from
outside sources, including Wikipedia.
"Frequently in my classes, as we are talk-
ing about topics - people mention some
theorist, or some article or some idea - and
someone will post a Wikipedia link into our
discussion logs," Fishman said.
Fishman added that crowdsourcing
technology is only as powerful as the peo-
ple who use it.
"It doesn't make sense to me to ask ques-
tions about whether. things like Wikipe-
dia are good or bad for student learning,"
Fishman said. "It's all about what you do
with them. I think there are lots of people
inventing lots of great ways to use these
tools, including students."

Though fair trade is often overlooked
in favor of the more accessible organic
movement, it's a form of easy activism for
the student looking to make a statement
about workers' rights and international-
ism.
"Fair trade is sort of in contrast to
unfair trade," said John Vandermeer,
professor of ecology and evolutionary
biology, "Unfair trade is where there is a
power relationship where some element
has more power than the other element.
Trying to get that into balance, that's
what fair trade is all about."

coffee typically have a far better life than
farmers who are not involved in it."
Generally, fair trade coffee is higher
quality than the typical Folgers fare.
Furthermore, fair trade coffee is often
intertwined with organically grown cof-
fee. You're probably not going to find fair
trade coffee at 7-Eleven, but if you reach
for a slightly pricier brew like the coffee at
Cafe Ambrosia on Maynard Street you'll
get a richer and ethically produced bev-
erage. But you have to look for the coffee
that says "fair trade certified." Not every
specialty coffee is fair trade, and chances
are your Starbucks fix isn't. And it isn't
always certain how fairly traded fair trade
actually is since one has to trust the word
of independent certifiers like TransFair.
"TransFair is one organization that is

Co-op bought directly from farmers.
"Everyone shops at the Co-op because
they trust us to sell fair trade, and we do
the best we can," Harmon said.
Some coffee roasters skip a couple
steps in order to directly trade with farm-
ers. They personally build relationships
with coffee farmers and some even go so
far as to fly to the actual farms. Ann Arbor
coffee shops and roasters like Lab Caf6 on
East Liberty Street and
Mighty Good Coffee
Roasting Co. on North
Main Street are driving
this movement forward.
"Direct trade came "The r

ers and shops around

support the movement,
according to Vander-
meer.
"In my opinion,
drinking coffee that's
fair trade is always a
good idea. ... Minimal-
ly, it says there is a market for it, so they
should be concerned about it. If it says it's
fair trade, it's worth demanding the prod-
uct," Vandermeer said.
At the request of students, the Univer-
sity has been offering organic fair trade
coffee in dining halls around campus since
February 2006 with the help of Michael
Lee, director of residential dining servic-
es. Lee joined the University in 2005 and
implemented fair trade coffee at other col-
lege campuses, according the University
spokesman Peter Logan..
"Providing fair trade coffee is not only
an opportunity to offer quality product to
campus diners, but it also is an opportuni-
ty to be socially conscientious toward food
providers as well as consumers," Logan
wrote in an e-mail interview.

Ambrosia, the Michigan Union, North
Quad Residence Hall and other student
hubs revealed that students are uncertain
about what fair trade actually means. Stu-
dents clutching cups of coffee shrugged
their shoulders and admitted that they
really didn't know why certain brands
boasted a fair trade sticker and why others
didn't. LSA senior Nora Stone said the lack
of popularity of the movement is due to
the typically tight student
budget.
"The one problem with
(fair trade) is the cost is
often so much higher than
if I were buying sort of
asters normal, free trade stuff,"
Stone said. "And obviously
,tly to for a poor college student,
the cost is a pretty big
arm s, determinate in where I
shop and what I buy."

rista Vandermeer believes
that if students become
more cognizant of their
consumption habits and
the far-reaching effect
their actions have on peo-
ple around the world as
well as their pocketbooks,
they'll accept the extra cost.
"There's also a personal stake in the
fair trade movement as well. We do want
to - at least most people I talk to and most
students I talk to - want to live in a fair
world," Vandermeer said. "And fair trade is
part of living in a fair world. If people have

tions so people inthe developed world, like
this country, can have the luxuries they
feel they deserve, that's not a fair world.

The roasters who purchase coffee
beans from farmers are the power holders
in this relationship. They have all the eco-
nomic and political capital and often set
prices for coffee beans that aren't suffi-

trade strives to eliminate this "middle

directly from farming co-operatives.
