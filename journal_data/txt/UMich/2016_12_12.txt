Political 
Science 
Prof. 

Andrei 
Markovits 
launched 

his 
new 
book, 
“Hillel 
at 

Michigan 
1926/27-1945: 

Struggles of Jewish Identity 
in a Pivotal Era,” at the 
University of Michigan Hillel 
Building 
Sunday, 
the 
day 

before the organization’s 90th 
anniversary.

Markovits, 
the 
2007 

recipient of the University 
Golden 
Apple 
Award 
for 

outstanding 
teaching, 

discussed how he came to 
research Hillel — a community 
center for Jewish students on 
college campuses — in front of 

an audience of about 25 people. 
He said he initially planned on 
just looking at the history of 
Jews at the University, before 
realizing how significant Hillel 
was to campus.

“Very soon it became clear 

that a chapter alone would not 
suffice and that this institution 
was 
worthy 
of 
a 
book,” 

Markovits said. 

Markovits 
read 
excerpts 

from 
his 
new 
book, 

highlighting 
particularly 

noteworthy findings, including 
the national Hillel’s founding 
in 1923 Illinois by a Christian 
minister who wanted Jews to 
have a greater understanding 
of their religion before making 
its way to the University a few 

Earlier 
this 
month, 

employees of the People’s Food 
Co-Op — a member-owned 
Kerrytown grocery store — 
secured the right to organize, 
but the move was a relatively 
long time coming.

During the spring of 2016, 

grumblings of dissatisfaction 
began 
to 
spread 
among 

employees.

Staff 
had 
recently 
been 

cut, 
according 
to 
co-op 

employee 
Jason 
Williams, 

and the workload was being 
disproportionately spread onto 
those remaining with little 
additional compensation.

Amid these new challenges, 

the management purchased a 
$600 sign for the store’s cafe, 
which was more frustrating 
for Williams than the lack of 
compensation for additional 
work.

“You’re telling people who 

are making $10.50 an hour … 
to take on another extra hour 
of work that you have to do 
in the same amount of time, 
you’ve got to have some sort 
of 
compensation 
for 
that,” 

Williams 
said. 
“And 
we’re 

not getting compensated for 
that, but we’re spending what 
is greater than my two-week 
salary on a benign sign.”

More 
importantly, 

perceptions 
have 
grown 

among employees that their 
management 
was 
failing 

to 
address 
their 
concerns, 

according to several interviews. 
A number of these workers, 
led by co-op worker Phillip 
Bianco, quietly began pursuing 
formal unionization through 
the National Labor Relations 
Board.

In collaboration with the 

local chapter of the United 
Food and Commercial Workers 
International 
Union, 
the 

small band of workers laid the 

groundwork for an official 
application 
for 
an 
NLRB 

election: If the majority of 
PFC employees were to vote 
in favor, they would be legally 
recognized as a bargaining unit.

After months of planning, 

around eight of the employees 
appeared at the Co-op’s Nov. 
16 board meeting to air their 
grievances 
and 
announce 

their NLRB election filing. 
Immediately 
afterward, 
the 

co-op board held an emergency 
extended session behind closed 
doors.

“There was definitely some 

shock at the board meeting,” 
said Ashley Secord, one of the 
employees at the meeting who 
spoke in favor of unionization.

Two days later, the co-op 

contracted David Parmenter 
and 
Associates, 
a 
human 

resources 
consultancy 
that 

Saturday, Jill Stein, former 

Green Party presidential nominee, 
came to Detroit to discuss the 
Michigan 
Supreme 
Court’s 

decision to halt a state recount 
of votes in the 2016 election to a 
crowd of about 20 people.

“Do we have a voting system we 

can trust?” she asked the crowd.

Stein’s recount initiative has 

gained national attention and 
support after raising over $7 
million to conduct a recount 
process in Michigan, Pennsylvania 
and Wisconsin — three states 
where 
President-elect 
Donald 

Trump narrowly won. Though 
former Democratic presidential 
nominee Hillary Clinton did not 
initiate the recount, her campaign 
expressed support for the process. 
All three states would have to be 
flipped to Clinton for the overall 
election outcome to change. 

However, 
the 
Michigan 

Supreme Court ended the recount 
effort in Michigan last week after 
complaints the recount would 
waste taxpayer money, because 
Stein came fourth in the state 
and there was a slim chance of

President-elect Donald Trump speaks at the Deltaplex for his Thank You Tour 2016 in Grand Rapids Friday.

GRAND 
RAPIDS 
— 
This 

weekend marked another stop 
on 
President-elect 
Donald 

Trump’s “USA Thank You Tour 
2016” across the country. The 
president-elect last stopped in 

the city almost a month earlier 
to the day, where he held the 
final rally of his campaign at the 
DeVos Place Convention Center. 
That night he announced it 
was the “beginning of a new 
adventure, an adventure to make 
America great again” — a month 
into his tenure as president-
elect, an adventure is one way to 

put the experience.

In many areas of Michigan, 

the aftermath of the election 
has been marked with hate 
crimes and protests including 
at the University of Michigan. 
However, there have also been 
displays of support, such as 
during Trump’s visit. 

Friday night at the Deltaplex 

Arena in Grand Rapids — even 
amidst 
a 
blizzard 
outside 

and reactions from the past 
month — spirits were high and 
red MAGA hats bountiful, as 
supporters awaited the man 
whom they expected to bring 
change. Though the election 
itself did not come down to the

Approximately 15 University 

of Michigan students gathered 
Thursday night in East Quad 
Residence Hall to participate 
in a roundtable bipartisan 
discussion on the importance 
and limitations of free speech 
on college campuses.

LSA 
sophomore 
Carlos 

Owens 
facilitated 
the 

discussion 
by 
asking 

participants questions relating 
to free speech — from campus 
to society as a whole. LSA 
senior Joshua Strup, president 
of 
the 
Michigan 
Political 

Union, which co-hosted the 
event, said he believes public 
universities should not be able 
to place limits on free speech 
on college campuses.

“Yes, on a private campus, 

whether it be the Ivy Leagues 
or religious institutions like 
Notre 
Dame 
or 
(Brigham 

Young University), you can 
have a code of conduct for your 
students that says, ‘We are a 
private institution; by coming 
here, you will follow this code 
of conduct to your speech,’ ” 
Strup said. “Whereas at the 
University, since it is a public 
institution, it’s funded by, and 
the constraints are placed 
by Congress, throughout our 
history, by all government-
funded 
institutions, 
the 

University has no place to say 
what is or not allowed, and 
quite frankly, the president 
needs to stay the hell out of it.”

Currently, the University 

has a free speech policy 
outlines 
the 
commitment 

to protect the freedom of 
expression of students and 
faculty.

The 
panel 
featured 

members 
from 
across 
the 

political 
spectrum. 
LSA 

junior William Presley said he 
believes there is no such thing 
as free speech, but merely 
speech 
that 
liberals 
find 

offensive.

“I take issue with the 

general use of the term ‘hate 
speech,’ ” said Presley. “There 
is no hate speech; there are 
only ideas. So there are some 
ideas that are not popular, 
that people don’t like, and 
they can call it hate speech, 
but in reality, speech is speech 
and we can’t ban something 
as hateful because we deem 
those ideas to be unpopular.”

However, 
not 
everyone 

agreed 
with 
Presley’s 

definition of hate speech: LSA 
junior Mateusz Borowiecki 
said it perpetuates harmful 
norms in society.

“We believe in certain 

things here. For example, 
we 
believe 
in 
not 

oppressing other groups 
with harmful speech and 
speech 
that 
reinforces 

existing hierarchies,” said 
Borowiecki. “So when we 
say we’re offended, it’s 
not saying my feelings 
are hurt, it’s saying that 
you’re 
saying 
speech 

perpetuating 
harmful 

hierarchies in our society.”

The 
group 
also 

discussed how President-
elect 
Donald 
Trump’s 

election will affect free 
speech and party polarity 
across the country in the 
upcoming years. Though 
the 
Michigan 
Political 

Union 
is 
a 
bipartisan 

group, only one student 
voiced support for Trump 
over the course of the 
meeting. However, LSA

the recount changing the outcome 
for her campaign. The recount in 
Michigan was expected to cost 
from $2 million to $5 million. Stein 
gave less than $1 million, given the 
requirement to pay $125 for each 
precinct in the state. Individual 
counties would have had to 
provide the remaining funds to 
finish the recount.

At the rally Saturday, Green 

Party member Anita Bell tearfully 
explained the conditions of polling 
stations in Wayne County — where 
she said ballot boxes were secured 
by duct tape or made from trash 
cans.

Bell also criticized those who 

stated Detroit was expected to be 
disorganized, accusing them of 
discriminating against the city.

“We are not going to take that 

as an excuse,” she said. “Because 
some people have that racist idea 
that 
Blacks 
are 
incompetent, 

corrupt or both, and so they can’t 
get an election right. Hot mess. 
Hot mess.”

Stein 
said 
other 
problems 

Detroit had during the election 
included broken scanners and 
unsecure conditions at the polls. 
According to Stein, the U.S. 
Civil 
Agency 
estimated 
that 

communities of color are 900 
percent more likely to face election 
disturbances, such as a vote being 
misread or thrown away. 

In Detroit, 59 percent of votes 

were 
considered 
uncountable 

in the recount due to problems 
with the ballots and old voting 
machines.

“We need to count every vote 

and make sure every vote counts. 
And that means we have to put 
an end to this de facto Jim Crow 
election system,” Stein said.

Stein said she thought Clinton 

should have filed for a recount, 
acknowledging there was little 
chance Michigan would have 
turned out as a Green Party state. 
However, Trump only beat Clinton 

by a 10,704 votes in the state, so 
Clinton filing for a recount could 
have made a more significant 
difference.

Stein also criticized the two-

party presidential debates and said 
there was not much talk of policy 
and little variety for people to 
choose from.

In 
response 
to 
Michigan’s 

choice to end the recount, Stein 
said she hopes to continue working 
with Michiganders and the Green 
Party for more secure voting 
procedures.

In particular, she said she hopes 

to fight a recent bill passed in 
the Michigan House that would 
institute more extensive voter 
identification laws. According to 
the Detroit Free Press, a majority of 
Michigan Republicans supported 
the bill, arguing it would create 
more security and less fraud, while 
Democrats opposed the bill and 
said it discriminated against many 
in Detroit and Wayne County who 
vote without photo ID.

Pontiac resident Linda Hasson, 

holding a “Jim Crow is Alive in 
Michigan” sign, said she was 
concerned 
about 
the 
“gang 

mentality” in Michigan. She said 
many officials and residents in 
Michigan tend to fight for their 
own interests and not for the 
support of the state.

“I don’t have the money to hire 

an attorney for millions of dollars,” 
she said. “All I have is my vote.”

Green Party member Lou Novak 

said the local fight was over after 
the shutdown of the recount and 
he is now hoping to focus his work 
on Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. 
The future in Michigan, he said, 
is more uncertain, but he hopes to 
continue to secure voter safety in 
the state.

“We are trying to see (that the 

stricter voter ID law) isn’t passed 
by our governor, which will be 
a rather difficult fight given our 
political climate,” he said. “But 
also making sure other legislation 
are represented and addressing 
the issues that were raised during 
this recount.”

years later. He also discussed 
early tensions between Jewish 
Greek life and Hillel as well as 
the contrasting ideologies over 
how to combat anti-Semitism 
that existed at the time.

“On a snowy day like this, 

for a book that is relatively 
specialized and a bit obscure, 
for them to come out on a day 
like this, that’s a big deal,” 
Markovits said of the event. “I 
felt very good that people were 
here.”

Hillel Development Manager 

Shayna Millman highlighted 
the value of Markovits’ book for 
the organization.

“I 
think 
it’s 
just 
really 

important 
for 
us, 
as 
we 

celebrate our 90th anniversary, 
to really continue to remember 
where we came from and 
what we were founded upon 
in order to successfully move 
forward and to see what things 
we do differently and what 
aspirations and opportunities 
and challenges we face that are 

still the same,” Millman said.

LSA senior David Beer, who 

has taken multiple classes with 
Markovits, said he found the 
event to be informative and also 
beneficial for the University as a 
whole.

“I’m a Jewish student here so 

I find the history of Hillel pretty 
interesting, but I don’t really 
know anything about it so it’s 
good to learn,” Beer said. “For 
the history of the University 
of Michigan, I think it’s very 
important. Knowing where we 
come from is always important 
in my opinion.”

Some 
members 
of 
the 

audience were students who 
helped Markovits conduct his 
research and write the book. 
Law student Charles Sorge who 
was a research assistant for this 
project, said it raised important 
points for the University.

“I 
worked 
for 
Professor 

Markovits on this and another 
project and I think just his 
genuine 
interest 
in 
this 

University 
and 
his 
passion 

toward the subject really shows 
through in the writing,” Sorge 
said. “I think it’s important for 
the University to commemorate 

Hillel’s birthday and to bring 
topics up that perhaps not a lot 
of other students, for sure not 
Jewish students, are aware of.”

Markovits acknowledged the 

experience of writing about an 
organization at the institution 
where he is employed, but said it 
hadn’t impacted his work.

“It’s perfectly possible — 

in fact it’s required — to be 
dispassionate,” Markovits said. 
“If I had been a professor at 
Berkley, it would have been the 
same. If this had been the Ohio 
State Hillel, it would have been 
the same.”

He added that he’s currently 

working on another, similar 
book.

“The future book is almost 

a little bit inverted. Here the 
whole story is about Hillel. It’s 
about not only Jewish students, 
but it’s about particular Jewish 
students. I want to look at how 
the University behaves toward 
Jews,” Markovits added.

For now, he said he is pleased 

with the book he’s just released.

“If you had said to me, a year 

from now, you’ll have a book on 
Michigan Hillel, I’d have said 
you’re insane,” he said.

state of Michigan, the state was

In Michigan, Trump won by 

10,704 votes — the narrowest

state. The close margin of votes

Party presidential nominee Jill 
Stein just hours prior to the

Michigan Republican Party, 
called the recount a “temper 
tantrum” on the part of Stein.

“Winning one was nice,” 

McDaniel said. “But winning 
twice is huge.”

The recount may be officially 

over in Michigan, with Trump 
set to be the president, but 
the election was still fresh on 
his mind. The majority of his 
speech focused on recalling his 
17 months on the trail leading 
up to Nov. 8. He said the 
election allowed him to travel 
all over the United States.

“This gets you to stop at 

states that you won’t stop at 
and that’s what our founders 
had in mind and that’s what 
people had in mind,” Trump 
said.

Now on the victory tour, 

Trump stuck to issues pertinent 
to the state like maintaining 
jobs. He hinted to the crowd 
that Ford Motor Company has 
made a promise for him that 

involves staying in Michigan 
and not Mexico. Ford has for a 
long time depended on Mexico 
for open trade and with Trump 
vowing to create more jobs and 
trade in the United States, this 
could change.

“No state has been hurt 

worse by our trade deals,” 
Trump said. “And that’s how 
I knew I was going to win 
Michigan.”

In addition, Trump also 

brought Dow Chemical CEO 
Andrew Liveris to the stage 
and announced he will lead 
the national Manufacturing 
Council. 
Dow 
Chemical 
is 

based in Midland, Mich., and 
Liveris said he intends to 
expand operations in the state.

“I 
might 
have 
a 
funny 

accent,” said Liveris, who is 
from Australia. “But I believe 
in America and I believe in 
Michigan.”

Michigan, 
Trump 
said, 

is something he believes in 
as well. Trump has already 
welcomed 
three 
Michigan 

natives — and two University 
of Michigan alumni — into 
his Cabinet. Betsy DeVos, who 
resides in Grand Rapids and 
whose family donated greatly 
to the Trump campaign, was 
chosen to be the head of the 
Department 
of 
Education. 

DeVos too spoke Friday night, 
stressing 
her 
devotion 
to 

“(making) 
education 
great 

again in this country.”

In 
Michigan, 
Devos’s 

appointment has been met 
with wariness, and experts 
nationwide have attacked her 
education credentials. Trump 
said at the tour stop she was 
“considered by everybody to 

be one of the top education 
reformers in the country.” 

Despite the overwhelming 

support 
for 
the 
president-

elect and his Secretary of 
Education 
pick 
from 
the 

crowd, the wariness felt across 
the country was not absent. 
Over the course of DeVos’ brief 
remarks, five protestors were 
escorted out of the arena in 
three spurts. 

DeVos, however, carried on 

throughout the interruptions, 
emphasizing her commitment 
to 
bolstering 
the 
school 

systems by removing Common 
Core and increasing support to 
private and charter schools. 

Afterward 
the 
protests, 

Trump commented there was 
no place safer than a Trump 
rally. Those in his audience, 
and those who elected him, 
were among the population he 
said was left behind by the past 
administration. 

“For the first time for many, 

many years what we do know is 
that the pages will be authored 
by each and everyone of you,” 
Trump said. “The American 
people will be in charge. You 
will never again fall on deaf 
ears.”

This, he pledged to the 

crowd, 
will 
be 
fulfilled 

through campaign promises 
and the spirit of adventure and 
victory he had promised just a 
month before in the same city.

“My message tonight is for 

all Americans,” Trump said. 
“I am asking you to join this 
incredible 
movement. 
This 

movement that nobody has 
ever seen before.”

specializes 
in 
de-certifying 

unions. In a written statement 
two weeks later, co-op general 
manager Lesley Perkins said 
Parmenter 
and 
Associates 

had approached the co-op to 
offer 
legal 
counsel 
through 

the 
election, 
unsolicited 
by 

management.

However, workers and other 

local labor advocates claimed 
Parmenter and Associates had 
a representation as a “union-
buster,” and Parmenter’s hiring 
sparked fears that management 
was 
actively 
seeking 
to 

undermine their unionization 
efforts.

Williams suggested the co-op 

management acted as though 
the pro-union employees were 
in the minority, and the hiring 
of Parmenter would intimidate 
dissenters to avert unionization.

“I think the first couple weeks 

they thought that we were the 
minority, and them bringing in 
the union buster was going to 
scare enough people to push it 
out,” Williams said.

Co-op board President Ann 

Sprunger declined to comment 
on unionization efforts, but 
said the board would be neutral 
throughout 
the 
unionization 

process. 
General 
Manager 

Lesley Perkins did not respond 
to a request for comment, and 
inquiries 
to 
management’s 

general email address were left 
unanswered.

At this point, Bianco took his 

fight public, placing a petition 
on 
Change.org 
protesting 

management’s hire and calling 
for support for the workers’ 
unionization efforts.

“(Management has) steered 

the Co-op onto a path that it 
cannot succeed on,” Bianco 
wrote in a petition protesting 
Parmenter 
and 
Associates’ 

hire. 
“Upper 
management 

hopes to make the Co-op more 
profitable by cutting labor and 
transforming this long-standing 
community institution into a 
mini-Whole Foods.”

In 
a 
Nov. 
26 
statement, 

the co-op workers offered a 
compromise. 
Acknowledging 

management had a right to seek 
outside counsel through the 
unionization 
process, 
Bianco 

suggested the co-op replace 
Parmenter 
and 
Associates 

with labor lawyer and City 
Councilmember 
Jack 
Eaton 

(D–Ward 4), who was viewed as 
more neutral. Management did 
not take them up on the offer.

“It’s always surprising that 

in a community like Ann Arbor, 
that prides itself as being so 
progressive, that elected boards 
would go to these ends to stymie 
their 
unionized 
workforce,” 

Eaton said, noting his offer of 
pro-bono counsel was declined. 
“They had other things in mind.” 

Acknowledging the pushback 

their hiring of Parmenter and 
Associates caused, the co-op 
board decided to terminate the 
law firm’s services on Nov. 28. 
It remains unclear if the firm 
performed any tangible work for 
co-op management in the time it 
was contracted.

That 
same 
day, 
Perkins 

tendered her resignation as 
general manager effective Dec. 
13, citing “being lied about and 
publicly vilified by staff” and 
an 
increasingly 
toxic 
work 

environment.

Williams 
said 
he 
regrets 

Perkins’ departure, saying the 
unionization effort was not 
intended as a personal affront 
to her but rather an attempt to 

drive greater dialogue between 
management and workers.

“It was really sort of crushing 

for me, because that isn’t what we 
wanted,” Williams said. “I know 
Leslie was under a lot of stress 
… but we didn’t want that, we 
just wanted to have a dialogue, 
and we wanted to work with 
you to do that. I think she took it 
very personally, and I wish that 
hadn’t happened … I know she 
felt stabbed in the back.”

Secord said it was regrettable 

that frictions emerged between 
the 
co-op’s 
management 

and 
employees, 
but 
added 

management 
has 
grown 

increasingly cooperative.

“We wanted to work with 

them … we weren’t interested 
in creating all this friction and 
animosity,” 
Secord 
said. 
“I 

definitely understand a lot of 
this frustration that’s happening 
… just the inevitable tension 
that arrives when you have two 
different groups of people with 
two different ideas.”

Last Friday, a secret-ballot 

vote was held among the co-op 
employees, with observers from 
the NLRB present. Twenty-
four workers voted in favor of 
unionizing, with nine voting 
against.

Sunday, Williams said he’s 

hopeful the newly-recognized 
union will not only better 
represent employees’ voices to 
co-op management, but also 
improve the store’s impact on the 
community. However, he also 
noted a sense of concern from 
the co-op board for the future of 
the establishment.

“I think they started to 

get the vibe this (past) week 
that the union was going to 
happen,” 
Williams 
said. 
“I 

think if anything, they’re very 
apprehensive or nervous about 
what’s going to happen now.”

CO-OP

tries not to focus as much on 
the title as the results of his 
volunteerism.

“I obviously consider it very 

humbling,” he said. “It’s a cool 
opportunity to be honored and 
be recognized for my hard work. 
But I don’t get too caught up in 
the (award).”

Khan 
said 
his 
volunteer 

work began in 2013 during 
his sophomore year of high 
school, when he filled out his 
application for the National 
Honor Society, an organization 
that recognizes high-achieving 
high school students. One of the 
admissions requirements was 
to perform a certain number of 
hours of community service.

It was then, he said, that he 

realized he had to do something 
productive with his time after 

school. He added he quickly 
found his answer in a local 
diabetes clinic in his hometown 
of Jackson, Mich. that evolved 
into another opportunity at 
Allegiance 
Health 
Hospital. 

Khan was acquainted with the 
hospital; he had spent time there 
in 2011 during his freshman year 
of high school when his father 
was treated for a debilitating 
stroke that forced him to give 
up his family transportation 
business.

“I was trying to figure out 

what I’m good at and what I 
should dedicate my time to,” 
he said. “I made it a goal to 
volunteer 20 hours that summer. 
I ended up doing 100.”

Since arriving at University 

of Michigan this year, Khan 
said he has not had time to 
return to those places at home 
to volunteer. Instead, he said he 
is focused on finding issues that 
he is passionate about changing 

here in Ann Arbor.

“Since I’ve gotten to UM, I 

haven’t been able to go back 
to the hospital or the nursing 
home,” Khan said. “So I’ve been 
seeking other opportunities … 
One of my goals at Michigan is 
to get as much as I can out of my 
four years here and have as big 
of an impact as possible.”

One of the ways Khan has 

found to make an impact is 
through the Syrian Orphanage 
Sponsorship 
Association, 
a 

student group centered around 
raising 
funds 
to 
sponsor 

Syrian orphans who have fled 
the country because of the 
current Syrian conflict. Syria is 
currently in an ongoing civil war 
which grew out of an uprising 
against the regime of President 
Bashar al-Assad in March 2011.

“The whole refugee crisis 

to me, I thought it’s been 
mishandled very badly,” he said. 
“If I joined (SOSA), I could help 

children around the world and 
impact their lives, which seems 
like a really cool opportunity.”

Khan 
cited 
Germany 
as 

a 
leader 
in 
refugee 
policy 

compared to the United States. 
He said he prefers Germany’s 
inclusive approach to taking in 
refugees over what he called 
the meager policy presented by 
the United States, especially 
because of its much higher 
capacity for space compared 
to Germany’s. According to 
Bloomberg, Germany took in 
1.1 million refugees in 2015. 
According to The New York 
Times, 
the 
United 
States 

reached its goal of admitting 
10,000 refugees in August of 
this year.

Khan said he has ambitious 

plans to help the cause of 
Syrian refugees in the United 
States, including reaching out 
to 
national 
companies 
and 

speaking to high schools about 

the issue.

“I’m going to try to contact 

the biggest names in the country 
and find anyone I can to push 
this message,” he said. “If I’m 
doing something, I want to see 
what’s the ceiling I can reach.”

In addition to his involvement 

in SOSA, Khan is also on the 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
Student Advisory Board for the 
DEI plan, University President 
Mark Schissel’s initiative to 
increase diversity and create 
an 
inclusive 
environment 

on 
campus. 
According 
to 

the University Student Life 
website, the board aims to offer 
student perspectives on the 
implementation and assessment 
of the plan.

Khan said he was motivated 

to apply to the board due to his 
desire to jump start an initiative 
he had been planning since 
high school to put low-income 
high school students on equal 

footing with those of higher 
socioeconomic 
status 
when 

applying to college.

“I wasn’t able to bring that 

idea to high school because I 
didn’t have enough time,” he 
said. “But I’m trying to figure 
out how I can work it into 
Michigan. I saw the opportunity 
(of the SAB) and knew that it 
fit exactly what I’m trying to 
accomplish. 
I’m 
passionate 

about all of those issues.”

Referencing 
his 
own 

volunteer experiences to give 
advice to other students who 
wish to get involved in similar 
work, Khan said students should 
seize each opportunity to work 
on what they are passionate 
about.

“If you’re passionate about it 

and can do something about it, 
you should definitely take that 
opportunity,” he said. “A lot of 
people would love to have that 
chance.”

VOLUNTEER

Council at the University, said 
even though he is not a Trump 
supporter, he is optimistic 
that the presidency will open 
up discussions regarding free 

speech across the nation.

“So, Republicans are really 

good at saying, ‘hey, we’re all 
in this together, let’s all move 
forward together, we’re all 
Americans,’ ” Nicholson said. 
“It seems like Democrats are 
really good at putting people 
into specific groups: ‘You’re 
Black, you’re white, you’re gay, 

you’re straight, you’re Muslim, 
you’re Christian, you’re this 
and that,’ and what happens 
is they fight each other. So, on 
the topic of free speech, and 
I learned this from a feminist 
from DC, it’s not just my 
opinion, it’s going to get better 
as far as opening up.”

SPEECH
From Page 2A


W

hile 
perusing 
my 

Facebook feed during 
a study break earlier 

this week, I found myself scrolling 
past New Jersey Gov. 
Chris Christie’s (R) face 
an unusual number of 
times. With the end 
of 
the 
presidential 

election and Christie’s 
replacement 
as 

chairman of President-
elect Donald Trump’s 
transition 
team, 
the 

governor had seemingly 
fallen by the wayside in 
today’s political news 
cycle. However, as I scrolled past 
the video of Christie from October 
2015 for the fourth time, I decided 
I might as well see what the fuss 
was about — and I’m glad I did. 
While Gov. Christie only implored 
his audience to consider attitudes 
about drug addiction, this video 
reminded me of another very 
serious and taboo issue: mental 
health. We must reach across the 
aisle to ensure an open dialogue 
and to vigorously combat these 
two fatal issues.

Gov. 
Christie’s 
mother, 
he 

said, had been a smoker since 
she was 16 years old. When she 
developed lung cancer in her 70s, 
“No one came to me and said, 
‘Don’t treat her ’cause she got what 
she deserved,’ ” Christie stated. 
Nobody refused to treat her and 
nobody abandoned her to cancer. 
Yet, he says, “Somehow, if it’s 
heroin, or cocaine or alcohol, we 
say, ‘Well, they decided. They’re 
getting what they deserved.’ ” 
Instead of treating drug addicts for 
their disease, we jail them or deem 
them to be lost causes.

This 
culture 
surrounding 

drug addiction is not only costly 
in terms of human lives, but is 
also just bad fiscal policy. In the 
United States in 2013, about 85,000 
people died from alcohol abuse, 
20,000 from illicit drug abuse and 
20,000 more from prescription 
drug abuse. While death is one 
extreme, drug abuse often also 
leads to relationship issues, job 
loss, 
homelessness 
and 
other 

devastating social and monetary 
losses. Additionally, according to 
FiveThirtyEight, of the more than 
207,847 inmates in federal prisons 
nationwide, 
48.6 
percent 
are 

incarcerated for drug offenses. To 
put this into perspective, the next 
most pervasive offense in federal 
prisons is for weapons, arson or 
explosives — at a comparatively 
low 16.8 percent.

Substance abuse costs U.S. 

taxpayers more than $600 billion 
annually. The average cost for 
one full year of imprisonment 
is roughly equal to $24,000 per 
person. Yet, the average cost of a 

full year of treatment for opioid 
addicts is about $4,700 per patient. 
The National Institute on Drug 
Abuse also states that “every dollar 

invested in addiction 
treatment 
programs 

yields 
a 
return 
of 

between $4 and $7 in 
reduced drug-related 
crime, criminal justice 
costs, 
and 
theft.” 

Clearly, incarceration 
is not the appropriate 
method for handling 
substance 
abuse. 
If 

we can save lives and 
taxpayer 
dollars 
at 

the same time, it is inconceivable 
that we should continue such an 
inefficient policy.

There are plenty who argue 

drug addiction is not an illness. 
However, 
according 
to 
wide 

swaths of research, addiction is 
indeed an illness — and one that 
is incredibly debilitating if not 
properly handled. The DSM-5 
— the handbook for diagnosis of 
mental disorders used by nearly 
all health care professionals — 
has an entire section devoted to 
substance-related and addiction 
disorders. This includes not only 
tobacco addiction, but also alcohol, 
marijuana, stimulant and opioid 
addiction. Yet, there is still a looming 
stigma clouding our perceptions of 
non-tobacco addiction. Despite the 
evidence, we have a difficult time 
conceptualizing drug addiction as an 
illness and not a choice. To be sure, 
people choose to begin using drugs. 
But just as much as they do not choose 
to become addicted to tobacco, they 
do not choose to become addicted 
to other substances. People turn to 
drugs for a variety of reasons, and 
instead of abandoning them, we 
must treat them. Further, the first 
step in combatting drug addiction 
is to talk about it. We cannot sweep 
such a pervasive issue under the rug 
if we wish to seriously fight it. In 
talking about it, we open the floor to 
discuss solutions that may actually 
address the issue more successfully.

In addition to drug addiction, 

mental health is another horribly 
stigmatized subject. On a personal 
note, mental health has become 
possibly the largest hardship in my 
life to date. While I fortunately do 
not suffer personally from mental 
health issues, I’ve been in the 
passenger seat to the struggles of 
a number of people close to me. 
In the beginning, these problems 
are difficult to detect: long stints 
in bed, withdrawn temperaments, 
unwillingness to attend social 
events and general irritability — all 
of which could look like just a bad 
day or week. But the regression 
often happens quickly, leading to 
outbursts, cuts, irrational behavior 
and worse. And from there, 

psychiatry sessions, medications, 
ruined relationships, job loss, 
police visits, stints in jail, stints 
in rehabilitation centers, stints in 
medical wards at hospitals, failed 
classes, failed suicide attempts 
and suicide actualizations. Mental 
illness — no matter the form — is 
crippling. If left untreated, if left 
ignored, it can destroy everything 
and everyone in its wake.

Yet, in public settings we never 

talk about it. We don’t talk about 
it, so we don’t know how to talk 
about it. We don’t talk about it, so 
we don’t know how to prevent it. We 
don’t talk about it, so we don’t know 
how to ask for help. I never learned 
about mental health issues in my 
grade-school health classes. We 
learned about sexual health, physical 
health and, at times, drug and alcohol 
problems, but never mental health. I 
didn’t recognize the warning signs 
at first. And I didn’t know how to 
address them once the problem had 
grown worse. I didn’t understand, 
and therefore didn’t know how to 
help. One in five adults in the United 
States have suffered from a mental 
health issue and the issue is especially 
salient on college campuses. In fact, 
suicide is the second leading cause of 
death in individuals ages 10 to 24. If 
we don’t teach people about mental 
health issues at an early age, the 
warning signs may go undetected 
until it is too late. 

I am not usually one to agree 

with Gov. Christie. In fact, I often 
vehemently 
oppose 
much 
of 

what he stands for. Yet, his video 
reminded me that even after this 
vicious and divisive presidential 
election, liberals and conservatives 
still have common ground. And 
we still have serious work to do. 
Drug addiction and mental health 
are not partisan issues. Matters 
of life and death should not be 
danced around for political gain. 
As Christie said, “I’m pro-life. And 
I think that if you’re pro-life, that 
means you’ve got to be pro-life for 
the whole life, not just for the nine 
months that they’re in the womb. 
… It’s easy to be pro-life for the 
nine months they’re in the womb. 
They haven’t done anything to 
disappoint us yet.”

Democrats and Republicans 

alike — pro-life or not — have 
an obligation to combat drug 
abuse and mental health issues. 
We must work to rid ourselves 
of these stigmas and develop 
education 
and 
treatment 

programs in order to save lives. 
We must alter our thinking — 
together — and devote resources 
to programs that will fix these 
issues instead of punish them.

CLARISSA DONNELLY-DEROVEN | COLUMN
Finding alternatives to police and prison
A 

couple days after President-
elect Donald Trump won, a 
couple days after a woman 

in a hijab on East William Street was 
threatened to be set on 
fire, a couple days after 
a woman on the corner 
of 
South 
University 

Avenue and Washtenaw 
Avenue 
was 
pushed 

down a hill for believing 
her religion and living in 
America, and a couple 
days after the Southern 
Poverty Law Center 
collected evidence of 
more than 900 hate 
crimes in the first 10 days 
of Trump’s America, I 
sat in my feminist thought class. We 
talked about the reported violence, 
we argued about the labeling of the 
violence as “intimidation” and we 
imagined the role the police might 
play in the coming years.

When violence happens, the general 

sentiment is that you’re supposed to 
call the police. The police will solve our 
problems, they will make us safe again. 
This, though, is only true for certain 
groups of people.

Trump and the rhetoric of 

his 
campaign 
normalized 
and 

encouraged angry white people to 
commit violence against people 
of color, LGBTQ people, Muslims, 
Jews, people with disabilities, 
women, etc. Almost none of these 
groups have been treated well 
historically or are treated well 
currently by the police, especially 
people of color. As an institution, 
the 
police 
have 
regularly 

brutalized 
these 
communities 

and/or ignored their needs. Thus, 
the people who are expected to 
have the most violence committed 
against them in the following years 
are put in an impossible position: 
What do you do when the people 
you’re calling on to deal with the 
violence perpetrated against you 
have a history of perpetrating that 
same, or worse, violence against you 
and your community?

There is a very real threat of 

increased civilian violence against 
people of color following Trump’s 
campaign and election, but because the 
police regularly commit acts of violence 
against communities of color, there 
still is no institution or organization 
to properly “deal with” this violence. 
Police 
and 
prison 
abolitionist 

movements are not new, but they feel 
necessary now more than ever.

In July of this year, Fox News 

invited community activist Jessica 
Disu, among other folks, to come 
onto “The Kelly File” to discuss 

the murders of Alton Sterling, 
Philando Castile and the Dallas 
police officers. The conversation was 
gross. It involved lots of white people 

yelling racist shit and 
Disu rolling her eyes, 
visibly uncomfortable. 
Eventually 
Disu 

chimed 
in, 
saying 

to an array of boos, 
“We need to abolish 
the police.” “Abolish 
the 
police?!” 
Megyn 

Kelly repeated back, in 
horror. Disu continued, 
”Demilitarize the police, 
disarm the police, we 
need to come up with 
community solutions for 

transformative justice.”

In an interview with the Chicago 

Reader — which is really amazing 
and I recommend you read it — 
Disu compares the abolition of the 
police to the abolition of slavery: 
“I’m sure when someone first said, 
‘We have to abolish slavery,’ it was 
like, ‘Whoa, that’s the stupidest idea, 
we’re making all of this money off of 
free labor, and you’re saying abolish? 
Like, that sounds ridiculous.’”

Police (and prison) abolition is 

far from the acceptable discourse 
concerning police reform you 
might hear on news outlets like 
CNN, Fox or even MSNBC. But 
many 
communities, 
especially 

poor communities of color, where 
the police are either not helpful 
or actively violent, have created 
and implemented police-free and 
prison-free ways of dealing with 
harm and violence.

You can read about lots of 

examples in the Chicago Reader, 
and I’ll summarize one for the sake 
of space. Ethan Ucker, co-founder 
of a restorative justice program in 
Chicago called Circles and Ciphers, 
tells a story about a robbery: A 
young guy stole from a store in the 
community. “One of the people at 
the store whose stuff was taken 
said, ‘Look, I don’t want to call the 
cops. Is there anything we can 
do?’” Somehow they found out that 
the young guy was selling some 
of the stolen stuff on Facebook, 
and they also found out that the 
young guy went to school at a place 
where Ucker had done some of his 
restorative justice work with Circles 
and Ciphers. So, Ucker was able to 
contact a teacher and get in touch 
with the young guy who had stolen 
the stuff and eventually brought the 
young guy who stole back together 
with the person he had stolen from. 
The young guy returned the stuff 
he hadn’t sold, and “in restitution 

for everything else” the young guy 
worked at the store. After he had 
worked as much as he needed, he 
realized he actually liked working 
there, so he went back after he was 
done to work and volunteer. He 
formed a relationship with the store, 
the owners, the patrons, etc.

Restorative 
justice 
is 
based 

on the principle that crime and 
violence 
are 
offenses 
against 

communities 
and 
individuals, 

instead of offenses against “the 
state.” This makes the approach and 
the reparations necessarily more 
intimate and personal. Studies have 
shown that in general, restorative 
justice approaches “reduce crime 
more effectively with more … 
serious crime,” especially violent 
crime. Restorative justice makes 
perpetrators of crime much more 
active in accepting responsibility 
than they’re made to be in the 
traditional, 
impersonal 
justice 

system; you committed X crime, the 
punishment for which is Y numbers 
of years in prison, here you go, accept 
it and then you’ve paid your debt to 
society — but not really even because 
our prisons are mostly a racialized 
caste system that once you get stuck 
in, you can never really escape.

We’ve been severely misled about 

the function of police and prison 
in society today. A world without 
police and a world without prisons 
doesn’t mean a world without 
protection or safety, nor a world 
plagued by violence. The police 
force as we know it was not created 
in response to rising crime rates, 
rather as a means of social control, “a 
response to ‘disorder.’ ” In southern 
states, the police were deliberately 
established as a slave patrol, whose 
responsibilities included: “(1) to 
chase down, apprehend, and return 
to their owners, runaway slaves; 
(2) to provide a form of organized 
terror to deter slave revolts; and, (3) 
to maintain a form of discipline for 
slave-workers who were subject to 
summary justice, outside of the law, 
if they violated any plantation rules.”

A world without police and 

prisons means a de-prioritizing 
of a certain understanding of 
“order,” it means community based 
solutions to problems and it means a 
redistribution of funding to support 
these new efforts. The presumption 
is not that crime will stop, but that 
we will find ways to deal with crime 
that do not necessitate more 
violence nor one-size-fits-all 
impersonal punishment.

ASHLEY ZHANG | COLUMN

First semester reflection

T

hough the semblance may 
not be obvious at first glance, 
an academic semester can 

actually quite feasibly be compared to 
an orchestral piece — Edvard Grieg’s 
In the Hall of the Mountain King to 
be exact. If you’re not 
familiar with the song, it 
starts slowly and quietly 
in the lower registers of 
the orchestra: the cellos, 
basses and bassoons 
calm and steady. As the 
music progresses, the 
tempo gradually builds 
as more instruments 
in different keys are 
added. Over the course 
of the next two and a 
half minutes or so, the “accelerando” 
and “crescendo” snowball until the 
“prestissimo” finale, at which point 
the music has reached new heights 
of frenzy and volume. To listen to it is 
to ride an uncontrollable train until, 
all of a sudden, it ends with a crash.

As the end of my first semester 

in college nears with unbelievable 
speed, I feel as though I’m in the 
midst of Greig’s masterpiece — 
the sheer volume of assignments, 
projects and tests thrown at me 
provokes whiplash and swallows 
me whole. In the middle of such 
a frenetic time, it can be difficult 
to find a moment to breathe and 
reflect on the past semester. It can 
be harder still to believe that a mere 
three months ago, college was all 
shiny and new, the semester was as 
lax as the beginning of In the Hall 
of the Mountain King and I was 
just another bright-eyed and bushy-
tailed freshman. I should note: I am 
still a freshman, but my eyes not as 
bright and my metaphorical tail not 
as bushy.

Although to upperclassmen I may 

still be green, in my mind, I — a soon-
to-be second-semester freshman 
— am as wise and seasoned as they 
come. I no longer get lost on the 
way to the Undergraduate Science 
Building. I know the Bursley-Baits 

Route as well as I know all the football 
chants. I’ve learned that meeting 
someone in class or at a party does 
not change the chances that they’ll 
remember your name the next time 
you meet. I know that independence 

is dangerous in that you 
can, and will, spend all 
your 
Dining 
Dollars 

on overpriced chips, 
ramen and coffee. I’ve 
realized that, despite 
high school starting at 
7:20 a.m., 8 a.m. classes 
(and 
even 
9 
a.m. 

classes) start too early.

And that’s just the 

surface-level stuff. As 
cheesy as it sounds, 

college has taught me so much about 
myself. For example, I’ve come to 
realize that my mind is much more 
suited to sciences than math, despite 
any contrasting notions I harbored in 
high school. I’ve learned that I don’t 
love parties as much as I thought I 
would. I’ve realized that I cannot 
function without sleep, not even 
with exorbitant amounts of coffee.

Even more than that, college has 

given me the ability to experience 
so many things for the first time 
and has, in turn, changed me. In 
September, I was terrified to move 
out and live without my family for 
the first time. Three months later, I 
love the freedom and independence 
I have in college. Back home, I’d be 
mortified of the thought of eating 
alone. Now, I cherish whatever alone 
time I have in the dining hall, free to 
check my emails and just rest while I 
eat. However, the largest change has 
been catalyzed by the opportunity of 
writing this very column.

I applied to be a columnist for 

the Daily on a whim with zero 
expectations 
given 
my 
limited 

experience with journalism. So 
when I was accepted, I received the 
news with a mix of surprise and 
trepidation. In fact, here’s an excerpt 
of my journal entry from Sept. 1, 
2016, the day I was accepted:

“Holy crap. I was just accepted as 

a columnist for The Michigan Daily! 
While on one hand, I’m excited that 
I was accepted, on the other hand, 
I’m terrified … I just can’t believe that 
people will be actually reading what 
I write. I’m not qualified to have 
people listen to me!! My writing has 
always been something I’m proud 
of, but kept hidden, because I’m 
embarrassed for people I know to 
read my stuff … and judge it. My heart 
is already pounding with anxiety.”

It’s hard to believe that I wrote 

that only three months ago, but the 
seven columns I’ve written between 
then and now are evidence of how 
my confidence in my writing has 
grown. Over the course of seven 
columns, I’ve learned how to use 
this small voice I have to bring 
attention to issues that are important 
to me: Asian representation in 
media, oppressive period culture, 
the unpretty reality of being a girl, 
the ridiculousness that is sleep 
deprivation competition and so 
much more. The kind and thought-
provoking emails and comments 
I’ve received because of them have 
mitigated any doubts I had about 
my credibility. I once thought no 
one cared about my opinion, but I’ve 
learned that if you have something 
worthwhile to say, people will listen.

This column has given me a 

platform to speak my voice. Yet, even 
without such a platform, college as a 
whole provides many opportunities 
to be yourself and follow your 
interests without fear of judgment. 
There are far too many people on 
campus to worry about all their 
opinions and judgments. Thus, to 
any miserable high schoolers who 
may be reading this, let me tell you 
one thing: It gets better.

‘Hairspray’ could have benefitted from a little less conversation.

After the creative and ratings 

success 
of 
“Grease 
Live,” 

NBC found themselves under 
substantial pressure for their 
next musical: “Hairspray.” Under 
the direction of Thomas Kail 
(“Hamilton”), 
“Grease” raised the 
bar for what a live 
TV musical could 
do. NBC reacted 
by 
increasing 

the 
scale 
of 

“Hairspray.” They 
moved production 
from a soundstage 
in New York to the Universal 
backlot in Los Angeles. They 
had numbers both outdoors and 
indoors and expanded the larger 
production numbers. However, 
“Hairspray” 
couldn’t 
quite 

find energy in the expansive 
production. There were certainly 
successful production numbers 
and very strong performances, 
but technical issues and slower 
scenes killed any momentum 
other elements of the telecast 
were building.

In 
an 
effort 
to 
expand 

their production based on the 
standards set by “Grease,” the 
producers decided to set many 
of their big musical numbers 
outside, 
leading 
to 
mixed 

results. Having “Good Morning 
Baltimore” take place as it’s 
getting dark, with artificial light 
attempting to make it feel like 
morning, feels strange and out of 
place. Still, the outdoor set, made 
to look like a Baltimore street, 
helped numbers like “Welcome 
to the ’60s” feel like they were 
taking place outdoors in the city 
(the dark setting didn’t hurt that 

number).

Like all of the live musicals 

that came before it, the book 
scenes dragged, preventing the 
show from gaining any real 
momentum. A lot of the big 
musical numbers were good with 
so much energy. Still, it seemed 
like after every musical number, 
there was a block of dialogue that 

moved 
slowly. 

However, 
the 

show 
ended 
on 

a 
positive 
note 

with “You Can’t 
Stop 
the 
Beat.” 

That number is 
probably a big part 
of why the show is 
as successful as it 

is. It’s full of singing and dancing 
and gives each character their 
moment in the spotlight. It never 
seems to stop.

Like 
other 
NBC 
musicals 

of the past, “Hairspray Live” 
had a very strong cast, with 
some performances verging on 
extraordinary. Jennifer Hudson 
(“Dreamgirls”) 
took 
on 
the 

supporting role of Motormouth 
Maybelle and owned every second 
she was on screen with two of 
the best songs in the show, “Big, 
Blonde and Beautiful” and “I 
Know Where I’ve Been.” Her 
voice is so pure and so strong 
that she stole the show, much 
like Audra McDonald did in 
“The Sound of Music.” Kristin 
Chenoweth (“Pushing Daisies”) 
knows how to play a diva, and she 
earned some of the biggest laughs 
of the show as Velma Von Tussle. 
Harvey Fierstein (who won a Tony 
for originating Edna Turnblad on 
Broadway) is clearly having fun 
returning to his role, and that 
helped bring Edna to life.

However, 
there 
were 
also 

performances that were passable 

at best. Ariana Grande (“Scream 
Queens”) took on the role of Penny 
Pingleton and didn’t do much 
with it. Sure, she has a good voice, 
but there was so much comic 
potential she left on the table. I 
also have mixed feelings about 
newcomer Maddie Baillio. On the 
one hand, she didn’t do anything 
wrong — her voice was fine and 
she acted decently. But she didn’t 
do anything to stand out as a lead 
actress.

There’s still one element of the 

“Hairspray” broadcast that’s very 
difficult to reconcile: the horrific 
technical 
issues. 
Throughout 

the broadcast, seemingly small 
mistakes kept piling up. During 
“Mama I’m a Big Girl Now,” the 
lights briefly blacked out on Tracy 
in her bedroom. A minute later, the 
set pulled up and revealed another 
part of the scene. Later, there 
were cuts to incorrect cameras 
(including in the powerful number 
“I Know Where I’ve Been”). Look, 
I understand broadcasts like this 
take substantial effort and are 
extremely hard to pull off, but 
wrong lighting and camera cues 
are just lazy. With increased scale 
comes increased difficulty, which 
leaves no room for screwups like 
that.

Though “Hairspray” is far 

from the best musical I’ve seen, 
it still holds a special place in my 
heart. It was the first show I saw 
on Broadway a decade ago, and 
the movie is one of my favorite 
movie-musicals. Still, this live 
production was not nearly as good 
as it could’ve been. They tried to 
replicate the success of “Grease,” 
but ended up with a show that 
had some awful technical issues, 
slow book scenes that nearly 
overpowered the strong cast 
and, overall, really good musical 
numbers.

‘Hairspray’ is no ‘Grease’

“Hairspray Live!”

Live Muiscal Event

NBC

“(Screenwriter 
Gary 

Wolfson) and I would talk 
about movie ideas,” said “The 
Pickle 
Recipe” 
producer 

Sheldon Cohn in a recent 
interview. “One night, out 
of nowhere, Gary said, ‘My 
grandma used to make these 
unbelievable pickles. My sister 
said she’d kill for the recipe.’ 
But his grandma never told it 
to anybody, and she died. So 
the pickles are gone because 
the recipe’s gone. And I said, 
‘that’s kind of a funny idea for 
a movie.’”

So began the journey of 

“The Pickle Recipe,” a feature-
length film about a desperate 
grandson 
stealing 
his 

grandmother’s prized pickle 
recipe to pay for his daughter’s 
bat mitzah. It opens in Ann 
Arbor Friday at the Michigan 
Theater.

Cohn is an alum of the 

University of Michigan film 
department 
and 
graduated 

from what was then called 
the Speech, Radio, TV and 
Film department in 1977. After 
working in advertising for most 
of his adult life, Cohn began to 
work on “The Pickle Recipe” 
with seven other University 
alums. 
Cohn 
emphasized 

that he mostly enjoyed the 
storytelling 
components 
of 

filmmaking, 
particularly 

writing and editing.

“One of the most fun parts 

was 
the 
writing 
process,” 

Cohn said. “Sitting with Gary, 
whether it was my house, 
his house, in my treehouse 
smoking cigars. Just throwing 
ideas back and forth — what if, 
what if, what if.”

The pre-production of the 

film as a whole was gratifying 
for Cohn — after finding Lynn 
Cohen, the woman who plays 
the grandmother, Rose, on 
YouTube, he reached out to 
her to see if she would want 
the part. She confirmed her 
interest a day after she was 
sent the script. 

The entire film was shot in 

Detroit and the surrounding 
suburbs. Cohn said one of the 
most important things for 
him was creating a positive 
representation of Detroit.

“We 
saw 
the 
film 
as 

a 
depiction 
of 
working 

Detroit. And just the shots 
of 
neighborhoods 
and 
the 

skyline were important to 
get,” Cohn said. “People from 
out of state say, ‘I didn’t know 
Detroit looked like that!’ The 
media has depicted Detroit 
as burnt-out buildings and 
vacant lots. They think Detroit 
is horrible looking. We have 
quotes from people saying 
(director) Michael Manaserri 
shoots Detroit with the same 
affection that Woody Allen 
shoots Manhattan. You can see 
that, in the way we photograph 
the city.”

“The Pickle Recipe” has 

been screened all over the 
country and audiences have 
been very receptive to it. 
According to Cohn, though, 
the critical reception has been 
less than ideal. “Not everybody 
likes the film,” Cohn said. “If 
you go on Rotten Tomatoes, 
the critics, they’re not nice to 
us … We didn’t sit there and 
want to make ‘Citizen Kane.’ 
We wanted to make a fun, 
enjoyable movie that was both 
funny and emotional.”

Despite the negative critical 

reaction, Cohn affirmed his 
excitement to release the film 
in Ann Arbor, with his fellow 
University of Michigan alums 
that worked on “The Pickle 
Recipe.” He underscored the 
importance of his education at 
the University and the way it 
gave him hands-on experience 
filming that would help him 
throughout his career.

“I got hands-on experience 

with 
equipment, 
worked 

with really good people and 
professors 
and 
appreciated 

what I did,” Cohn said. “My 
career after U of M is working 
at real projects. Learning how 
to tell a story. Something I 
kept in mind from Michigan 
was, ‘is there anything I can 
do to make it better?’ You 
just have to keep working on 
it until it’s as good as it can 
be. I like working with the 
people from Michigan, and I 
love the idea that it’s going to 
play in Ann Arbor. That’s very 
sentimental.”

FILM INTERVIEW

PARAMOUNT PICTURES

Is Jason Bateman the most typecast man of all time? We think so.

In 
a 
conference 
call 

promoting his recent comedy 
“Office 
Christmas 
Party,” 

actor and comedian T.J. Miller 
(“Deadpool”) 
talked 
about 

everything imaginable, from 
his improvised comedic style 
to stories of a wild Texan 
house party. Needless to say, 
the entire conversation was a 
riot. Miller stars in the movie 
as Clay Vanstone, the wilder 
and relaxed brother of Jennifer 
Aniston’s 
character, 
Carol. 

Miller shared some of his own 
crazy holiday party stories that 
rival the chaos in the “Office 
Christmas 
Party” 
trailer, 

describing 
one 
particularly 

wild Christmas.

“If you were at (this) party, 

you were kissing or you were 
missing out,” Miller said. “And 
that was insane. I kissed 15 
people, okay? Some of them 
women, some of them animals.”

These 
types 
of 
zany 

stories 
and 
ridiculous 

commentaries are what make 
Miller so entertaining. His 
ability 
to 
combine 
absurd, 

surrealist humor with gags is 
unpredictable and stylistically 
unique. For him, acting is about 
improvising on the spot rather 
than deep character studies 
and Daniel Day-Lewis-esque 
methods.

“I think by now actually 

in Hollywood, if you hire me, 
you know that I’m going to be 
improvising,” Miller said. “So, 
that’s either a good thing, or it’s 
kept me from getting certain 
jobs.”

On 
the 
set 
of 
“Office 

Christmas Party,” improvising 
was even encouraged.

“A lot of these lines are my 

own, you know?” Miller said. 
“But it was a great script by 
great writers, and we also have 
this guy, Robert Terbowski. He 
was constantly producing post-
it notes with alternate lines.”

Miller placed great faith in 

the writers and even admits 
to 
not 
reading 
the 
script 

beforehand. “I didn’t even read 
the script before I signed up for 
the project, because I’m not a 
very good actor,” he said. “So I 
don’t usually read the scripts.”

Miller is best known for his 

roles as Weasel in the successful 
superhero movie “Deadpool” 
and Erlich Bachman in HBO’s 
“Silicon Valley.” Although both 
characters are fan favorites, 
they aren’t the most virtuous of 
people. Clay Vanstone, however, 
does not quite resemble these 
abrasive and arrogant roles that 
feature a heavy arsenal of crude 
jokes and clever insults. “This 
was a good opportunity for me 
to say to America, ‘I don’t just 
play an abrasive blow-hard 
asshole who sort of insults 
anybody and everyone very, 
very sharply,’” he said.

When asked what ingredient 

Miller 
is 
in 
the 
“Office 

Christmas 
Party” 
ensemble, 

Miller 
said, 
“I’m 
paprika. 

Paprika. OK. P-A-P-R-I-K-A. 
And paprika’s sort of the spice 
that is its own kind of flavor, 
but helps to enhance and 
heighten the other flavors. I 
was the ingredient that both 
added something to the overall 
film, but also helped sort of 
enhance and elevate the flavors 
of comedy around us.”

The 
holidays, 
for 
many, 

involve anxiety-inducing family 
get-togethers and long plane 
rides with negative emotional 
return on investment. Miller 
wants 
audiences 
to 
escape 

what could be a painful couple 
of days and do what everyone 
deserves to do after a stressful 
2016: party hard.

“Right 
now, 
we 
need 

something to go laugh at that is 
positive and inclusive, and even 
a little bit more than that — it’s, 
uh, just a party. It’s about a huge 
party. It’s about everybody 
coming together to party, and 
that’s the message.”

“Office 
Christmas 
Party,” 

for Miller, is a blissful escape 
from the stressors of daily life 
and holiday parties. “Have 
too much eggnog, go and see 
a funny movie or stay home 
and watch something funny,” 
Miller said. “It’s not time to

In a conference call, the actor discussed his role in the film

TV REVIEW
FILM INTERVIEW


STYLE NOTEBOOK

It’s that time of year. If you 

are not involved in Greek life, 
you have eyed your Instagram 
blankly over the past few 
weeks, wondering where it 
is all of these well-dressed 
college girls are going, and 
why they bothered to go there 
at all. Sure, you have heard the 
term “date party,” but it has 
become yet another empty, 
college-kid 
term 
gathering 

dust in the back of your brain. 
Something about girls and 
boys and a lot of pictures, 
right?

More inclusive than the 

mixer and less extravagant 
than the formal, one might call 
the date party the Goldilocks 
“just right” territory of all 
Greek functions. Our Greek 
amiga, Arrie Timmer, said it 
best: “Date party is an event 
organized by a fraternity or 
sorority where the members 
invite their own dates and you 
go to a club or somewhere cool 
and have a fun time.”

And though that all sounds 

fun and great, what sort 
of ensemble would such a 
characteristically 
“college” 

outing require?

I sought out to find an 

answer.

After 
extensive 
research 

(and 
a 
lot 
of 
Pinterest-

ing) I have safely formed a 
hypothesis: the date party look 
is 
inexpensive, 
Instagram-

friendly 
and 
unabashedly 

sexy. 

What, exactly, does a price-

friendly outfit search entail? 
“I searched black dress on 
Amazon Prime and filtered 
the results from price: low to 
high,” said first-year sorority 
sister Jane Schmid. “And that 
was the most important part 
because I’m poor. So then I saw 
a nice long-sleeved one, which 

is good for fall or winter, with 
hella cute cutouts and it was 
like $12 so I was thrilled.”

Onto the next: there is 

more to a great outfit than a 
pretty price tag. Stylistically 
speaking, a date party outfit 
must possess high levels of 
Gram-ability (a term I am 
coining right now). In other 

words, if it won’t look good 
on social media, it will not be 
worn. What makes the whole 
look Gram-able is certainly 
subjective, but there appear 
to be a few key rules to 
follow. As Anne noted during 
our 
conversation, 
many 

girls decide upon all-black 
everything because “it’s the 
norm,” meaning no one will be 
confused if you choose to post 
a full-body photo of yourself 
that night. Timmer chimed in 
with a note on accessories, and 
said that they “are key if you’re 
a cool girl.” She mentioned 
that chokers are very in right 
now, but that she loves a 
“good body chain.” Regarding 
shoes, no one seemed to pay 
any mind. As Jackie said, “It’s 
mostly about the dress because 
they only see the dress in your 
Instagram anyways.” 

Finally, 
the 
date 
party 

look is incomplete without 
an acknowledgement of sex 
appeal. Each of the girls 
with whom I spoke agreed 
that they are “not a big fan 
of loose dresses” and tend 
to opt for tighter options “to 
feel most confident and fun.” 
Schmid’s fitted, cutout dress 
and Timmer’s little green 
number seemed to fit the build 
appropriately. 

After all that hubbub, I 

couldn’t 
help 
but 
wonder 

whether the perfect date 
party look was worth the 
trouble it involved. However, 
after asking our friendly DP 
enthusiasts, the answer felt 
clear: date party is worth it. 

“You’ll 
be 
there 
with 

some of your best friends 
and it’s just a blast to have a 
carefree night where you feel 
pretty and just dance with 
your friends,” Schmid said. 
Timmer agrees: “For me, 
date party is a reason to look 
hot and have fun with your 
friends and a cool date,” she 
said.

Every date party look may 

be unique in its own right, 
but each shares the common 
goal of combining confidence 
with youth-infused fun. Girls 
like Timmer and Schmid 
have 
forged 
an 
overlap 

between looking good and 
feeling good, and they are 
proud. 

Although I am entirely 

unaffiliated with Greek life, 
I now smile every time a 
date party candid crosses 
my Instagram’s path. Yes, 
it is the DP time of year, but 
that no longer sounds so bad 
to me.

Date party style tips from 
an Instagram voyeur

TESS GARCIA
Daily Arts Writer

The outfit is everything in the DP experience, and trends 
are leaning in favor of the modern, sexually liberated woman

The date party 

look is incomplete 

without sex 

appeal.

E!

All I want for Christmas is this Dallas Cowboys inspired outfit.

Mariah Carey, heartbreaker 

that she is, has a set of rules. One 
of them, explicitly stated to the 
camera in her new docu-series 
“Mariah’s World,” ordains that 
Mariah 
Carey 

will never be seen 
in 
fluorescent 

lighting 
without 

sunglasses. 
It 

also appears that 
she 
doesn’t 
sit 

in chairs, like a 
horrific 
normie. 

Her talking head 
interviews 
are 

instead 
filmed 

wide, 
her 
body 
carefully 

positioned horizontally across 
an extravagant sofa and her 
unnaturally 
perfect 
head 

propped up on a stiff elbow in 
a transparent attempt to make 
it look good. Lest we forget 
that this is a woman whose 
last album was titled Me. I Am 
Mariah…The Elusive Chanteuse, 
the new show is a constant 
reminder that for Mariah, it’s 
like that.

Let’s get this out of the way 

first, though: I am fully on 
board here. As I type this, a 
“Daydream” poster looms over 
my head like a subtle invitation 
to 
write 
something 
nice. 

Mariah Carey is preternaturally 
talented 
and 
supernaturally 

attractive; when she sings, 
the angels cry. Mariah Carey 
is, without a doubt, the single 
greatest recording artist in 
music 
history, 
and 
if 
you 

disagree we’re throwing hands 
behind the dumpster at an 
Applebee’s where $20 can get 
you two delectable entrees and 
an appetizer at participating 
locations.

So, unless she firebombs a bus 

full of orphans or is secretly a 
J. Cole fan, Mariah will always 
be my baby. But objectively, 
“Mariah’s World” doesn’t offer 
much to the average viewer.

It’s 
a 
transparently 

managed “look” at her inner 
life, 
and 
only 
the 
parts 

she’s 
comfortable 
showing. 

Whatever the requisite quota 
for manufactured drama is for 
an E! show, here it is ginned 
up to uncomfortable levels, 
landing in the awkward valley 
between 
actual 
issues 
and 

overreactions to being unable 

to set up an Apple TV. And I’m 
here for it.

The music, unfortunately, 

takes up only a small role in 
“Mariah’s World;” outside of 
“Fantasy” roughly 37 times in 
the opening 10 minutes, the 
show is less concerned with 
Mariah the Artist than it is 

with Mariah the 
Vision Of Love. 
Indeed, there isn’t 
a single moment 
on 
camera 
in 

which she isn’t 
impeccably dolled 
up, adorned with 
what 
I 
assume 

is 
ridiculously 

expensive jewelry 
and 
garbed 
in 

an assortment of dresses that 
scream, “I don’t know Jennifer 
Lopez.”

The rare moment of honesty, 

however, pierces through the 
otherwise stuffy series like 
a 
meteorite. 
Occasionally, 

Mariah allows herself to be 
unguarded and vulnerable: her 
interactions with her children, 
while obviously staged, are 
clearly 
loving 
and 
full 
of 

emotions, and she occasionally 
flashes a witty self-awareness, 
only to shake it off moments 
later to complain about a piece 
of choreography.

And it’s in these moments 

that one might come to consider 
the possibility that this all 
may be one huge joke. You get 
the sense that she’s much too 
smart and self-conscious to be 
producing something so inert. 
The transition montages of the 
singer posing in outrageously 
exaggerated 
fashion, 
an 

uncomfortable yet ludicrous 
scene in which a prospective 
assistant has to dump her 
boyfriend, bizarre interludes 
from a cartoonish alter-ego 
named “Bianca Storm” — is 
Mariah Carey, master of the 
public image, pulling a fast one 
on us?

Intriguingly 
enough, 

however, Mariah prods at the 
heart of our devotion to her 
right off the bat. “They want 
me to be grand, then they 
want me to accessible. Can you 
guys make up your mind?” she 
exclaims, waving her hands in 
exasperation.

What, really, is the point of 

our collective obsession with 
Mariah Carey? Emphatically 
brushing aside idiotic questions 
of whether or not she’s still 
relevant (please get, as they 
say, up out my face), one can 
read “Mariah’s World” as a 
tongue-in-cheek interrogation 
— perhaps unintentionally — of 
the public desire for celebrity. 
We applaud the faux-relatability 
of stars like Anna Kendrick or 
Jennifer Lawrence, but also the 
lush extravagance of a Beyoncé 
awards show set. There’s a fine 
line the average celebrity must 
traverse to remain likable, but 
our subject here, of course, is 
not the average celebrity.

Watching 
Mariah 
Carey 

frolic around her fiancé’s yacht 
in Italy isn’t accessible, but isn’t 
that what we signed up to see? 
Do we really want to watch her 
wake up in the morning, groggy, 
sans makeup and immaculate 
hair, complaining about the 
mundane absurdities of normal 
life, like the rest of us?

Of course, “Mariah’s World” 

is not interested — at all — in 
some probing critique of the 
American 
culture 
industry. 

It’s a frivolous look into the 
life one of the most towering 
figures 
in 
the 
medium, 
a 

person whose contemporary 
status has become inseparable 
from the concept of “diva.” 
Mariah Carey as abstraction 
is 
a 
complex, 
distinctly 

American 
phenomenon, 
and 

an honest look into her day-to-
day life might have been truly 
liberating, but this is not an 
emancipation of MiMi.

I’m not sure I would have 

wanted 
that, 
and, 
most 

importantly, I don’t think she 
would have either. Hers is a 
carefully 
manicured 
image, 

somehow 
freed 
from 
the 

constraints of hackneyed ideas 
like “relevancy.” Perhaps, one 
sweet day, the cipher of Mariah 
Carey will be unlocked. Until 
then she will remain eminently 
opaque and intimately present; 
it seems, plainly, we belong 
together.

The end of the road

Michigan entered the 
weekend with hopes of 

returning to the Final Four, 
but the Wolverines fell short

Things were going swimmingly for the 

Michigan ice hockey team.

After scoring two power-play goals in 

the first period to jump out to an early 
lead, the Wolverines had killed four 
penalties in the second period to preserve 
their lead.

But hockey is a fast-paced game. The 

game can turn in an instant, and when 

Wisconsin scored on its fifth power play 
of the period, the Badgers looked to have 
captured the momentum.

Perhaps that shouldn’t have been the case 

in the first place: The Wolverine penalty kill, 

sterling up until that point, had allowed the goal 
on a 4-on-2 Badger rush that only materialized 

after Badger goalie Jack Berry tripped Jake Slaker. 

Then, less than a minute later, freshman goaltender 

Hayden Lavigne took an ill-advised roughing penalty 

when he knocked over Wisconsin’s Seamus Malone in 

front of the net to the delight of the crowd.

Michigan was on its heels. And given the Wolverines’ 

performance this year, it wouldn’t have been a surprise to see 
them cough up the lead. After all, they had done just that the 
night before.

But Michigan didn’t let its late second period misfortunes 

affect it. The players returned to the ice for the final period, 
calmly killed the remainder of Lavigne’s penalty and held on to 
win the game, 4-1.

“We were a desperate team tonight,” said Michigan coach 

Red Berenson. “We had to play hard, and we had to play better. 
Getting the first goal of the game was important, and the second 
goal, and then I thought the wheels started to come off with the 
penalties. … Our penalty-killers did a great job and our goalie did 
a great job in keeping the score down.”
“Those are the kind of games that we’re going to have to play in 

to win games this year. We’re not going to outscore the other team by 

five and six goals. Last year is over, and our team has to learn that. We 

can’t take those kind of penalties and expect to win games.”
It was an impressive bounce-back game for the Wolverines, who had 

collapsed Friday night in a 7-4 loss that might’ve been their worst of the early 

season. Michigan had taken an early two-goal lead only to give up three straight 

and a total of five in the second period to the Badgers. The tone was somber after 

the game, as Michigan coach Red Berenson and junior defenseman Sam Piazza tried 

to explain what had happened.
Whatever conversations took place between them must have had an effect. Michigan 

was sharp from the opening puck-drop, scoring two quick goals. Senior forward Alex Kile 
scored his first goal since late October off a feed from freshman forward Jake Slaker on a 
Wolverine power play. A little over a minute later, junior forward Cutler Martin sniped one 
past Berry for his third goal in as many games, giving his team a 2-0 lead.

After the tumultuous end to the second period, Michigan dealt with a couple more 

bad breaks at the end of the third. Will Lockwood appeared to be badly injured by 

a Wisconsin check, leaving immediately for the locker room while grabbing his 

shoulder, before Dexter Dancs was called for slashing to the consternation of 

the Michigan bench.

But the Wolverines stood tall once more, killing the penalty even 

as Wisconsin pulled Berry to take a two-man advantage, and 

Tony Calderone and Adam Winborg sealed the win with late 

empty-net goals.

For Michigan, the win ended a three-game losing 

streak to open conference play, and as the final 

horn sounded, the Wolverines celebrated 

heartily as the band played them off 

the ice with the fight song.

It was a similar scene

A hopeful ride, and the end of the road

A

fter his team’s first 
weekend of the 2016 
season, Michigan 

volleyball 
coach Mark 
Rosen said he 
doesn’t like 
to compare 
teams from 
different 
seasons. 
There are 
too many 
variables: 
different 
players, different circumstances, 
different schedules.

But last week, with this 

season nearing its end, when 
asked to compare, Rosen 
couldn’t help but see the 
resemblance. His team finished 
above .500 in the Big Ten for the 
first time since 2012, reached 
the Sweet 16 for the first time 
since 2012 and was on a collision 
course to play Texas for the 
first time since the Longhorns 
eliminated Michigan from the 
NCAA Tournament in 2012.

There were more similarities: 

Rosen’s 2012 team and his 2016 
team had a core group of veteran 
players, but also a handful of 
freshman contributors. Two of 
his freshmen on the 2012 team 
were fifth-year senior leaders 
on the 2016 team. And that 2012 
team made the program’s only 
Final Four.

The Wolverines landed in 

Austin, Texas, on Wednesday 
looking to get back to that level. 
It didn’t happen. Friday night in 
the Sweet 16, Creighton ended 
Michigan’s season by winning 
the decisive fifth set, 15-7.

When Rosen spoke on 

Wednesday, he knew that might 
happen. He knew Creighton 
had a good team. He knew the 
Wolverines had lost 10 times 
before this season, and had 
lost other NCAA Tournament 
matches before. He did not claim 
that his team was infallible. He 

had one belief about how the 
weekend would go.

“I think we’ll play our best 

volleyball,” he said. “Whether 
it’ll be enough or not, I don’t 
know. But I’m confident that if 
we play our best volleyball, then 
in some ways — I wouldn’t say I 
don’t care, because we all want to 
win — but again, we can’t control 
that.”

Inside what he could control, 

he tried to treat everything as 
normal. Some things were not, 
of course: For the postseason, 
the NCAA logo was printed 
on the court. The court itself 
was brought out just for the 
weekend. Thursday, the NCAA 
held a special pre-regional media 
session.

“There’s instincts in you to 

want to go, ‘Hey, we gotta make 
this more important,’ or ‘We’ve 
got to do this differently,’ but I 
think that’s the wrong approach. 
I think for us, we want to just 
make it normal.”

Michigan knew how to do 

that — it had done so all year. In 
Rosen’s eyes, that was one of the 
qualities that made this team 
so successful. Led by fifth-year 
seniors Kelly Murphy and Ally 
Davis and senior Abby Cole, the 
Wolverines kept their perspective 
all season.

They had to, in the ruthless 

Big Ten. The Wolverines lost 
five matches against top-three 
teams, including two in five sets, 
most recently Nov. 20 at No. 2 

Minnesota.

Rosen did not try to make that 

feel normal. “This hurts a lot, but 
it should,” he recalled telling his 
team. “If you care a lot and you 
put a lot into it, it’s gonna hurt.”

Earlier this season, he 

compared the nation’s toughest 
conference to a “meat grinder,” 
and his team’s schedule was 
never tougher than in the last 
three weekends. That span 
consisted of five matches against 
top-15 teams — No. 1 Nebraska, 
No. 2 Minnesota, No. 3 Wisconsin 
and Michigan State twice — and 
only one win, against the then-
14th-ranked Spartans at home. A 
1-4 finish to the regular season 
was not an ideal way to enter the 
NCAA Tournament.

“But you would have never 

known from looking at our team 
in the way that they practiced, or 
the way they prepared or the way 
they even played in matches,” 
Rosen said. “They never looked 
down. We were a little worried 
about that going into it — how’s 
that going to be with our 
confidence if we don’t win more 
of these? And our team never 
once looked affected by it in a 
negative way.”

That stretch told Rosen all 

he needed to know heading 
into the postseason. His team 
hosted the first weekend of the 
NCAA Tournament for the first 
time since 2009 and dispatched 
American and Oregon to move 
onto the Sweet 16. It moved onto 

Austin, where it hoped to have 
the chance to avenge the loss 
from four years ago and return to 
that level.

Rosen did not know how 

it would go. About half of his 
team played in the NCAA 
Tournament last year, but his 
eight freshmen didn’t. They 
were all playing in a new gym. 
They knew they were playing 
a good team, but they hoped 
that if they played their game, it 
would be good enough.

For most of the year, that 

worked. They prepared the same 
way, played the same way and 
split the first four sets with the 
21st-ranked Blue Jays.

They fell behind in the fifth 

set, 9-3, and yet in the timeout, 
their mindset was the same. 
Rosen took a knee in front 
of his team and calmly gave 
instructions, trying to keep 
spirits up. “All that matters is that 
we win the next point,” he said. 
“All night long, the next point is 
all we can win. Let’s just win this 
point.”

Michigan did, forcing a lift 

call on the ensuing play. But 
the deficit was too much to 
overcome, as Creighton landed 
a kill just inside the boundary 
to end the match. Again, the 
Wolverines’ demeanor was the 
same. Rosen shook the opposing 
coaches’ hands, high-fived his 
players one by one and then 
turned and walked to the locker 
room, head down.

The tournament run that had 

so much promise, that looked like 
it could bring back memories of 
2012, ended for the Wolverines. 
They knew what they had to 
do, and they did it; it just wasn’t 
enough. Their season ended short 
of the 2012 level they thought 
was possible. That hurt. And as 
Rosen said, it should.

Peppers finishes fifth 
in Heisman balloting

Jabrill Peppers made highlight 

reels all season, but as expected, 
Louisville 
quarterback 
Lamar 

Jackson one-upped him and the 
other finalists Saturday night at 
the Heisman Trophy ceremony. 
By a large margin, Jackson won 
the Heisman Trophy, given to 
the best overall player in college 
football.

Peppers finished fifth in the 

voting and was one of five finalists 
at the ceremony in New York City. 
Jackson won with 2,144 points, 
followed by Clemson quarterback 
Deshaun Watson with 1,524, 
Oklahoma 
quarterback 
Baker 

Mayfield with 361, Oklahoma 
wide receiver Dede Westbrook 
with 209 and Peppers with 208.

With Jackson’s win, the last 

primarily defensive player to win 
the Heisman is still Michigan’s 
Charles 
Woodson 
in 
1997. 

Peppers has drawn comparisons 
to Woodson since he arrived 
on campus, and his numbers 
matched up earlier this fall after a 
torrid start to the season.

But opponents began to key on 

Peppers, and his numbers tailed 
off enough to hurt his candidacy. 
He finished the regular season 

with 27 carries for 167 yards and 
three touchdowns; two catches 
for three yards; 21 punt returns 
for 310 yards and a touchdown; 
10 kick returns for 260 yards; one 
interception, 72 tackles, 16 tackles 
for loss and four sacks.

He earned the title of most 

versatile player in college football 
by winning the Paul Hornung 
Award 
on 
Thursday 
night. 

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
often used that term to describe 
him this season, and he used 
Peppers all over the field to back 
that up.

Jackson, 
meanwhile, 
was 

electrifying on offense, racking 
up 3,390 passing yards with 30 
touchdowns and 1,538 rushing 
yards with 21 touchdowns. He 
was the favorite after a terrific 
September and maintained that 
title for most of the season.

Peppers will now turn his 

focus to the Wolverines’ matchup 
against Florida State in the 
Orange Bowl on Dec. 30. Another 
important question over the 
next month will be whether that 
game will be Peppers’ last in a 
Michigan uniform. The redshirt 
sophomore is eligible for the NFL 
Draft this season, and he would 
likely be a first-round pick in the 
spring.

Michigan’s season comes to an end 
in Sweet 16 of NCAA Tournament

The Michigan volleyball team 

was one set away from clinching 
a spot in the quarterfinals of 
the NCAA Tournament. But 
Creighton took an early lead in 
the fifth and final set that the 
Wolverines couldn’t overcome, 
and Michigan was eliminated 
from the tournament.

After a net violation was called 

on the Wolverines in the fifth 
set, the Bluejays were set up for 
the match point. It appeared 
Michigan thought the ensuing 
kill from Jaali Winters was going 
wide, but it clipped the sideline 
and simultaneously pulled the 
plug on the Wolverines’ season.

It 
was 
clear 
from 
the 

beginning that Creighton was 
in control of the match. Even 
though Michigan took the first 
set, the Bluejays ended the set 

with a .239 hitting percentage 
compared to the Wolverines .196.

“It became hard to stop them 

defensively because they were 
really balanced,” said Michigan 
coach Mark Rosen. “They were 
better at getting kills and that’s 
usually a big difference in our 
game, because kills are points.”

The Wolverines struggled to 

score against a strong defense, 
which finished with 20 blocks. 
Michigan could only muster 12 
blocks due to Creighton’s fast-
paced offense.

In 
the 
third 
set, 
the 

Wolverines made the necessary 
corrections to easily take the set, 
25-17. On the set point, senior 
middle blocker Abby Cole tipped 
the ball over the net, forcing 
a miscommunication on the 
Bluejays and giving Michigan the 
set.

The Wolverines trailed early 

in the last two sets, surrendering 

their 2-1 set lead. In the fourth 
set, Creighton led, 17-11, its 
largest lead of the match. After 
a lift was called on Michigan, 
Rosen called a timeout.

The Wolverines were then able 

to pull within four points, but 
after a long rally, it was Lauren 
Smith who forced the fifth set for 
the Bluejays.

With the fifth set only going to 

15 points, it was important to get 
off to a hot start.

Unfortunately for Michigan, it 

made too many unforced errors 
to compete with Creighton. The 
Wolverines were down, 9-3, and 
they seemed hopeless.

It was fifth-year senior Kelly 

Murphy’s last volleyball match, 
and fortunately for her, it was one 
to remember. She finished with 
17 kills and 13 digs, but her impact 
went beyond the scoresheet. As a 
leader of the team, she showed 
the underclassman how to not 

lose hope, even when faced with 
defeat.

In the waning moments of 

the fifth set, Cole re-entered the 
match. The Wolverines had all 
three captains on the court, and 
it was clear the team needed 
their guidance. Cole made a 
statement in those final points 
with two decisive kills. But it 
wasn’t enough to salvage the 
match, and Michigan fell in the 
fifth set, 15-7.

“I think our three seniors 

were phenomenal,” Rosen said. 
“They really brought so much to 
the table when it comes to how 
this team developed together. We 
talk a lot in our program about a 
growth mindset.

“Every game we’re going to 

get better. Every day, we’re going 
to follow the process and the 
outcome will take care of itself. 
And I thought this team stayed 
very true to that.”

WRESTLING

MEN’S GYMNASTICS

Wolverines suffer narrow loss to Minnesota

“Disappointing” was the word 

Michigan coach Joe McFarland 
repeatedly used to describe his 
team’s 22-18 loss to Minnesota.

Coming off an appearance at the 

Cliff Keen Las Vegas Invitational, 
the Michigan wrestling team 
headed into Sunday’s dual against 
the Golden Gophers after the 
Wolverines experienced a solid 
start to the season.

Michigan was focused on 

setting the tone from the start, 
and did just that throughout 
the initial stages of the dual. 
Freshman Sal Profaci defeated 
Gannon Volk with an 11-5 decision 
in the 141-pound category, giving 
the Wolverines a 3-0 lead.

In the 149-pound category, 

sophomore Zac Hall extended his 
team’s lead, beating the Golden 
Gophers’ James Berg with a major 

decision.

But Michigan’s initial success 

hit a snag in the 157-pound 
category 
after 
senior 
Brian 

Murphy lost a decision to Jake 
Short, cutting the Wolverines’ 
lead by three points.

Despite 
this 
temporary 

setback, 
redshirt 
freshman 

Logan Massa jolted new hopes 
into Michigan’s game after he 
defeated Minnesota’s Brandon 
Kingsley 17-2 via a technical fall. 
Massa’s win came one week after 
the rising star won an individual 
title at last week’s invitational. 

But the Wolverines could not 

convert this momentum into a 
win. Freshman Myles Amine lost 
a decision to Nicholas Wanzek, 
and junior Ernest Battaglia lost 
a major decision to the Gophers’ 
Robert Stevenson.

The 
Wolverines 
were 
in 

desperate need of a victory to 
turn their woes around. However, 

neither 
redshirt 
freshman 

Jackson Striggow nor freshman 
Dan Perry were able to cut their 
opponent’s lead, losing a major 
decision and by technical fall, 
respectively.

Michigan 
freshman 
Austin 

Assad’s following match against 
Steven Polakowski was therefore 
a must-win for the Wolverines. 
While Assad was able to keep 
the score close, it was not 
enough, losing a 6-4 decision to 
Polakowski. This put the Golden 
Gophers up 22-12, and Michigan 
was out of reach.

Though the score did not 

finish in the Wolverine’s favor, 
freshman Stevan Micic would 
end the dual on a high note. In the 
133-pound category, Micic pinned 
Minnesota’s Mitch McKee to win 
via a technical fall, but his victory 
was not enough to turn the tables 
for his team.

“Some of those matches, we 

just got out-handed, out-fought 
and out-hustled,” McFarland said. 
“We didn’t execute the way we 
should have.”

Despite 
seven 
out 
of 
10 

Michigan 
atheletes 
being 

freshmen, McFarland said that 
the team’s youth should not be an 
excuse for underperforming. 

McFarland 
also 
said 
that 

his team has to make some 
improvements this week.

The Wolverines will now have 

a couple of weeks to reflect and 
do that, with their next match 
not until their dual against 
Iowa after the winter break. 
Sunday 
reminded 
Michigan 

of the importance of starting 
well and taking advantages of 
opportunities when they present 
themselves.

“We had opportunities to score 

and we weren’t able to capitalize 
on that,” McFarland added. “And 
that cost us.”

Massa gives dominant 
effort in Michigan loss

Eight days before Logan 

Massa, the now-No.2 wrestler 
in the 165-pound weight class, 
faced off against Minnesota’s 
Brandon Kingsley, the redshirt 
freshman 
increased 
his 

momentum at the Cliff Keen 
Las Vegas Invitational. After 
going 6-0 in Las Vegas, Massa 
became the fourth wrestler 
in Michigan history to take 
the individual championship, 
earning the Big Ten Wrestler 
of the Week award for the 
165-pound 
weight class.

“That was 

a huge honor 
and winning 
out 
there 

was a great 
experience,” 
Massa 
said. 

“It 
gave 

me a lot of 
confidence 
going 
into 

the second part of the season.”

His road to the award began 

with victories over two top-
10 opponents. In his semifinal 
match, Arizona State’s then-
No. 9 Anthony Valencia proved 
not to be an issue, as Massa 
accumulated four takedowns to 
rack up 17 points. Valencia tried 
fighting back late in the first 
period, but Massa retaliated 
in the third, earning the 17-4 
victory.

“I was patient, attacked a 

lot and let the points build up,” 
Massa said. “I’ve been being 
offensive, having fun with it 
and building off each match.”

And build off it he did. Massa 

went on to win the tournament 
with a win over Wisconsin’s 

then-No. 
2 
Isaac 
Jordan, 

capturing a title that only 
three Wolverines before him 
had earned. The victory also 
allowed him to advance to the 
No. 2 spot in the country. 

By amassing enough riding 

time late in the third period, 
Massa was able to earn the one 
point advantage needed to win 
the match over the three-time 
All-American.

“He goes out and continues 

to 
execute 
and 
attack,” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
Joe 

McFarland. “Logan does a 
great job. … He’s progressing 

because he goes 
out and wrestles 
hard.”

Building 
off 

his 
success 
a 

week 
earlier, 

Massa 
forced 

Kingsley to the 
mat in his dual 
match 
Sunday 

and 
practically 

controlled 
the 

bout the entire 

time. His 17-2 victory over 
Kingsley came as no surprise, 
though, as he improved his 
already perfect season to 15-0.

Though 
the 
Wolverines 

lost the dual meet against 
No.18 Minnesota to start off 
the Big Ten campaign, Massa 
was able to lead by example 
with his decisive win over his 
opponent.

McFarland said that Massa’s 

successes 
stem 
from 
his 

consistent intensity in practice 
and in meets. With the rest of 
Big Ten play coming up, Massa 
will look to notch a few more 
Big Ten Wrestler of the Week 
awards as Michigan seeks to 
become a dominant force in the 
conference.

Blue notches victory 
in intrasquad meet

From the moment the Maize 

and Blue Intrasquad began to the 
moment it ended, Cliff Keen Arena 
was never silent. But it wasn’t 
because of the crowd. On the 
sidelines, the booming cheers and 
words of encouragement from the 
Michigan men’s gymnastics team 
filled the room as they supported 
their teammates. 

“As soon as I heard the 

team behind me, I just got the 
confidence in my abilities,” said 
freshman Mitchell Brown. “It 
helped me realize that I knew how 
to get the job done.”

The sideline support clearly 

paid off for the team’s newest 
members, as four of the team’s 
eight 
freshmen 
— 
Brown, 

Mack Lasker, Justin Murphy 
and Thomas Paul — all earned 
mentions in the awards ceremony 
in their collegiate debut. Lasker 
and Paul took first-place titles in 
the pommel horse and still rings 
during the first and third rotation, 
respectively, each with a score of 
13.500.

This 
annual 
intrasquad 

functioned as a way to get the 
men’s gymnastics team in a 
competitive 
mindset, 
and 
to 

give the freshman a taste of 
competition in preparation for the 
upcoming regular season.

The Blue team outperformed 

Maize in four out of the six events 
— floor, pommel horse, still rings 
and high bar — contributing to 
its 242.450 to 236.550 victory 
Saturday afternoon. 

Blue maintained a solid lead 

throughout most of the dual, 
with the exception of the end of 
the third rotation, where Brown 
and redshirt sophomore Marty 
Stretch’s 
outstanding 
vault 

performance put Maize ahead.

Sophomore 
Emyre 
Cole 

proved himself key to the Blue 
squad’s 
domination, 
earning 

the all-around title with the top 
score of 78.100. His highlights 
included taking joint first-place 
titles on both vault and high bar, 

with scores of 14.600 and 13.900, 
respectively. 
He 
additionally 

placed second on floor after 
sticking a two-and-a-half twisting 
double back, and earned a joint 
third-place title on still rings. 

Placing 
second 
all-around 

with a score of 77.050, Stretch 
impressively 
executed 
his 

routines as well. He took the joint 
event title for vault with a score 
of 14.600, and took the event title 
for parallel bars with a 13.650. 
Additionally, he earned second 
place on still rings and third place 
on the high bar. 

Senior captain Tristian Perez-

Rivera and sophomore Justin 
Hopgood secured event titles as 
well. Perez-Rivera scored a 13.900 
with a strong floor routine in 
the first rotation, and Hopgood 
earned his joint first-place title on 
high bar in the final rotation, also 
scoring a 13.900.

The intrasquad was not only a 

debut for the freshmen, but also a 
debut for the new Code of Points 
that was implemented for the 
2017 season. The starting values 
for routines in every event have 
been altered, with vault start 
values being lowered by .040 and 
all other event start values being 
lowered by .050. 

“It will probably take a season 

for (the new rules) to become 
natural,” said Michigan coach 
Kurt Golder.

While impressed with many of 

the skills he saw executed by both 
teams, Golder was disappointed 
with the hit percentage, which 
was around 50 percent and was 
lower than it had been a few weeks 
prior during training in the gym. 
Golder attributed this difference 
in part to the crowd and to the 
harder surface the gymnasts were 
landing on in Keen as opposed 
to the practice gym, where the 
softer floor gave way for easier 
dismounts.

Golder intends to focus on 

hit percentage in the upcoming 
weeks as the Wolverines approach 
their regular season, which will 
begin Jan. 14 at the Windy City 
Invitational in Chicago.

Michigan starts season with exhibition win

Crisler Center hosted an 

exciting atmosphere Saturday 
with the fans’ first chance since 
April to watch the Michigan 
women’s 
gymnastics 
team 

compete. From the crowd to the 
celebrity judges — who included 
former football players to radio 
personalities — most of the 
building clapped along to senior 
Nicole Artz’s floor routine, 
which she concluded with her 
signature point at the judges.

The 
meet 
between 
the 

Wolverines 
and 
Eastern 

Michigan may have just been 
an opportunity for the women 
to practice their routines in a 
competition setting, but that 
doesn’t 
mean 
they 
weren’t 

taking it seriously.

After trailing at the end of the 

first rotation, the Wolverines 
stepped it into gear and earned 
a victory, 196.200-194.750.

Five new freshmen joined 

this season’s roster, and they 
had to step up. A wrist injury 

kept 
out 
sophomore 
Olivia 

Karas — last year’s Big Ten 
Freshman of the Year — who is 
still recovering from surgery in 
the summer.

Michigan’s 

first 
rotation 

was 
on 
the 

vault. 
Three 

freshmen 
competed 
and 
proved 

that 
nerves 

wouldn’t affect 
them. 
Senior 

Talia Chiarelli 
stumbled 
on 

her 
landing, 

though 
fortunately 
for 
the 

Wolverines, 
her 
score 
was 

dropped.

Meanwhile, 
Eastern 

Michigan was competing on the 
bars. Natalie Gervais slipped 
off the bar during a release 
move and could not continue 
her routine. She received a zero 
for her performance and didn’t 
compete again for the rest of the 
day, but her teammates kept the 
competition alive.

Michigan fared much better 

on the bars. It finished all six 
routines cleanly and freshman 
Lexi Funk stuck her first career 
landing. But, it was Artz and 

junior 
Brianna 

Brown who shined 
in this event. They 
both finished with 
a 9.925 and pulled 
the 
Wolverines 

into the lead.

Funk 
and 

freshman 
Polina 

Shchennikova 
were the lead-off 
routines on the 
beam, 
an 
event 

that demands near perfection. 
Though they did wobble at 
times, 
they 
finished 
what 

appeared to be solid routines. 
They were awarded a 9.650 and 
9.300, respectively. Michigan 
coach Bev Plocki saw decent 
performances and didn’t think 
the scores reflected them, and 
she soon found out why.

“I said something to the 

judge 
and 
she 
said, 
‘The 

celebrities gave her a 9.0,’ and 

they thought because she had 
a stumble on her dismount they 
took it from a 10.0 to a 9.0,” 
Plocki said. “I was like, ‘Dudes, 
you can have two falls for a 9.0.’ 
But I mean, that’s the fun of 
it, hearing commentary from 
a person who doesn’t really 
know or understand. It’s fun to 
hear what are the things they 
appreciate about it.”

Sophomore Emma McLean 

earned a 39.400 for the day, 
securing 
her 
an 
all-around 

victory. Due to her hard work 
during fall workouts, she was 
able to add two more events to 
her competition.

“It was really fun,” McLean 

said. “The last time I did that 
was my senior year (in high 
school), and it was reminding 
me of what it was like and I 
really enjoyed it.”

It was an exciting experience 

for the entire team, but the 
fun of the day didn’t take the 
team’s attention away from 
the improvements it needs to 
make before the season starts in 
January.

Michigan 
beat 
then-No. 
4 

Boston University in front of a 
raucous crowd. With that win, 
the Wolverines appeared to be 
on their way to turning a corner 
after an uninspiring start.

As Michigan enters a short 

break, 
it 
remains 
unknown 

whether Saturday’s win will 
change the course of the season.

“I think the core of the team 

really needs to have a message 
that resonates with every player,” 
Martin said. “... I think as we 
leave, every player needs to search 
themselves a little bit and know 
their role, what they have to do 
for the second half of the season, 
coming back and being ready to 
play, being a true Michigan hockey 
team and being winners.”

HOCKEY

Martin extends scoring streak to three

Freshman 
forward 
Jake 

Slaker had already tallied an 
assist on the first goal of the 
game, but he wasn’t done. With 
just over seven minutes left in 
the first period, Slaker trapped 
a pass and left the puck floating 
on the ice in front of junior 
defenseman 
Cutler 
Martin. 

Martin 
quickly 
jumped 
on 

the opportunity, scraping up 
the puck and shooting it past 
Wisconsin 
goaltender 
Jack 

Berry.

The goal came during the 

second game of Michigan’s 
weekend split against Wisconsin 
and was one of four goals 
recorded in the 4-1 win. Martin 
also contributed a shorthanded 
goal the night before on a 
two-on-one 
breakaway, 
but 

Michigan (1-3-0 Big Ten, 7-8-1 
overall) was already down by 
two goals and unable to come 
back from its deficit.

In the Wolverines’ weekend 

split, 
Martin 
has 
recently 

proved to be instrumental in 
the scoring process. So far 
this season, he has tallied four 
goals, three of which came in 
the last three games.

“I’ve been playing forward 

since what, the third game of 
the season now?” Martin said. 
“Never played, or I played two 
or three games last year, just 
a few shifts here and there. I 
think now I’m finally getting 
the hang of it, finding the 
right spots. I’m playing with 
a lot of guys that are really 
good, they’re finding me and 
getting the puck in the slot, 
so they make it pretty easy for 
me. But the coaches are in my 
ear — ‘Shoot it, 
shoot it, shoot 
it! Don’t pass 
it!’ — so I’m just 
trying to shoot 
it.”

So far, it looks 

like 
that 
has 

been 
working. 

Two of Martin’s 
goals 
have 

come 
during 

important times 
in games for the Wolverines — 
his first goal of the season tied 
the game against Michigan 

Tech, and his most recent 
gave Michigan a two-goal lead 
against Wisconsin, a team that 
had previously pounded them 
one night earlier, 7-4.

After primarily playing as a 

defenseman at the beginning 
of 
the 
season, 
Martin’s 

promotion to left wing on the 
second line this past weekend 
has recognized that effort. 
The series featured physical 
performances from both teams, 
and the Wolverines racked up 

a high number 
of 
penalties. 

Martin’s goal on 
Saturday helped 
guide the team 
to 
a 
victory 

despite 
those 

penalties.

But Michigan 

can’t 
rely 
on 

scoring 
to 
be 

there to pick up 
the pieces every 

time it tallies penalties, and 
Martin acknowledges that.

“We’re obviously trying to 

play tough out there,” Martin 
said. “Our team this year, we 
have to play tough in order to 
win. I think that the officiating 
is what it is, and we have to 
go out there and play as hard 
as we can and just try to find 
a way not to be in the box. We 
kind of knew (Friday) the way 
they were calling the game 
that we’re going to have to play 
clean, so that’s on us to stay out 
of the box. We can’t take that 
many penalties and continue to 
win games. It’s just not going to 
work.”

The Wolverines will now 

have a break until the Great 
Lakes Invitational at the end 
of December, which means 
they’ll have plenty of time to 
patch up inconsistencies with 
the penalties. Michigan has 
been experimenting with lines 
as well, so it’s unclear whether 
or not Martin will remain at 
his position on the second 
line. But with Martin’s recent 
production, it will be hard to 
downsize his role. 

Junior defenseman lights lamp in both games against Wisconsin as Wolverines earn split at home

LANEY BYLER
Daily Sports Writer

“I think now 

I’m finally 
getting the 
hang of it.”

Wolverines fall short at UCLA

Five seconds remained in the 

first half when UCLA’s Lonzo 
Ball dialed one up from a different 
planet, 
canning 
a 

3-pointer 
from 
the 

center court logo at Pauley 
Pavilion.

The shot from deep tied the 

game at 50, the latest ludicrous 
shot in a matchup that seemed to 
be following a defense-optional 
rule.

The scoring didn’t end with 

Ball’s long triple, but the trend 
quickly started to favor the 
Bruins, as the Michigan men’s 
basketball team fell victim to 
UCLA’s high-scoring offense and 
came up short in a barnburner, 
102-84.

“They only missed 19 times 

and they got nine of those back, 
so that hurt, too,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein. “Now, the 
ball bounced our way a couple of 
times. I thought we got off to a 
good start, but I mean, they made 
some shots in that game that we 
were right in them. …That takes 
the wind out of you after a little 
bit.”

Michigan 
knew 
it 
would 

have its hands full entering the 
matchup against the second-
ranked Bruins. UCLA (10-0) 
was averaging 97 points per 
game — good for second in the 
nation — and was coming off a 
marquee road win against then-
top-ranked Kentucky on Dec. 3.

In the first half, though, 

Michigan (7-3) rode its success 
from beyond the arc and looked 
poised to go toe to toe with the 
Bruins’ juggernaut offense.

The Wolverines opened the 

game with a 3-pointer from 
senior guard Derrick Walton Jr., 
and they didn’t shy away from the 
triple for the rest of the frame, 
shooting 75 percent from deep.

UCLA, delivering a dominant 

showing in its own right, went 

10-for-14 from three and handed 
over the reigns to Ball, who 
poured in 14 points in the first 
half.

Neither team seemed capable 

of missing, but Michigan led 
for just 5:47 of the first half. It 
did so without its third-leading 
scorer in sophomore forward 
Moritz Wagner, who played just 
12 minutes after picking up two 
fouls in the first frame.

Still, 
despite 
Wagner’s 

absence, Michigan led by seven 
with 1:22 left. Much like their 
games against Texas and Virginia 
Tech, though, the Wolverines 
allowed UCLA to go on a 9-2 run 
— capped off by Ball’s long three 
— to close the half.

By the time the first buzzer 

sounded, it seemed the stars 
might have been aligning for 
Michigan to pull off an upset.

But in the second half, trying 

to beat the Bruins at their own 
game caught up to Michigan.

As 
quickly 
as 
the 
shots 

from beyond the arc gave the 
Wolverines life, they took away 
any hope of surviving against 
the Bruins. Michigan shot just 
2-for-10 from deep in the second 
half and posted a field-goal 
percentage of 34.5. If the first half 
was perfect, then the second was 
just the perfect storm.

UCLA claimed an eight-point 

lead after posting an 8-2 run over 
the first three minutes, as the 
Wolverines opened the second 
half 1-for-6 from the floor, and 
never 
trailed 

from there.

Though 
the 

Wolverines kept 
the margin at 10 
points or fewer 
for 
roughly 

15 
minutes, 

eventually, 
the 

second-ranked 
offense 
in 
the 

country 
turned 

a shootout into 
an offensive clinic. The Bruins 
missed just seven shots in the 
second half, and with 4:31 left, 

Bryce Alford and TJ Leaf put 
daggers into Michigan’s hopes 
for an upset.

Behind 
Leaf’s 
dunk 
and 

Alford’s 
free 
throws 
and 

3-pointer, UCLA 
scored 
seven 

unanswered 
points to claim 
a 16-point lead. 
The Wolverines 
had no answer 
from there, as 
they never cut 
the deficit below 
14. 
While 
the 

Bruins’ 
offense 

only got hotter, 

Michigan’s was put on ice.

“(UCLA’s) really good at what 

they do,” Beilein said. “They 

spread you out. They’ve got 
shooters everywhere. We tried 
to take away the three ball and 
give them the tough two, and 
we didn’t do either one very 
well. When they would see the 
matchup they liked, they would 
just take us. And so if you’re 
giving a lot of help, they’re a 
really good passing team. This is 
a rare team right now that shoots 
the ball at that level and can 
really pass the ball.”

For 20 minutes, there was the 

hope that the Wolverines would 
be taking off from a California 
runway with a marquee win of its 
own under its belt. But by the end 
of the second 20, they could only 
leave with the thought of what 
could have been.

‘M’ splits weekend trip

After beating San Diego State, 

92-57, on Friday, the Michigan 
women’s basketball team had its 
second opportunity to defeat a 
top-10 team this season. Instead, 
the margin this time was wider, 
as the Wolverines fell 84-64 to 
No. 9 UCLA on Sunday.

It was never a close game. The 

Bruins went on a 14-0 run before 
Michigan 
managed 
a 
single 

point, and they refused to give up 
that lead.

Michigan’s 
leading 
scorer, 

junior guard Katelynn Flaherty, 
had a hard time getting through 
the Bruins’ tough defense in the 
first three periods. Flaherty had 
just five points going into the 
second half, despite averaging 
20.1 per game this season. But 
UCLA guard Jordin Canada was 
difficult competition.

“(Canada) 
is 
really 
an 

exceptional 
player,” 
said 

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “All around player, great 
passer, 
great 
scorer, 
great 

defender. I remember watching 
her in high school on film one 
night … and my husband looked 
up and goes, ‘Man that girl can 
play quarterback for my football 
team, the way she runs her 
team and the way she can throw 
those passes.’ And not much has 
changed since her high school 
days. She’s really a special player.”

Despite 
her 
competition, 

Flaherty exploded in the fourth 
quarter, scoring nine points 
on 3-for-4 shooting. Flaherty’s 
nine points in the frame tied 
senior guard Siera Thompson’s 
record of 215 career 3-pointers. 
It was not enough to make up the 
deficit, though.

In addition to Flaherty’s 14 

points, three other Wolverines 
tallied double digits. Freshman 
guard Kysre Gondrezick scored 
18, sophomore forward Hallie 
Thome added another 15 and 
junior guard Jillian Dunston 
scored 10.

Gondrezick 
was 
the 
only 

double-digit scorer who is not 
a starter for Michigan. As a 
freshman, she has made quite an 
impact off the bench, capitalizing 
on opportunities when Flaherty 
is getting targeted on defense as 
she was Sunday night.

“(Gondrezick 
is) 
just 
the 

presence that we need alongside 
of Katelynn and Siera,” Barnes 
Arico said. “Hopefully people 
start keying on her. And then 
we talk about it all the time, 
the other team’s best defender 
is 
guarding 
Katelynn, 
their 

second best defender is guarding 
(Thompson), 
their 
third-best 

defender is guarding our next 
guard and that gives a great 
matchup for a kid like Kysre. And 
she really took advantage of it 
tonight.”

Despite some bright spots, the 

Wolverines struggled. The lack 
of scoring early on meant that 
Michigan could never set up its 
defense fully. The Wolverines 
also ran into trouble when Thome 
had three fouls in the first half, 
which presented an obstacle that 
was too big to overcome.

Even though Michigan was 

unable to topple the Bruins, 
the 
trip 
to 
California 
had 

some redeeming factors. The 
San Diego State game was the 
antithesis of the UCLA game. 
The Wolverines never once fell 
behind, ending the game with 
several impressive statistics.

Thompson had her first double-

double of the season, scoring 11 
points and notching 11 assists. 
She broke her previous career 
record of eight assists. Gondrezick 
proved to be consistent with 18 
points, and Flaherty had 21 points 
in just 26 minutes of playing time.

Though the game against 

the Aztecs ended in victory 
for the Wolverines, Michigan 
will be leaving California with 
a sour taste in its mouth. The 
Wolverines learned that they 
can’t rely solely on offense, and 
even with high scoring, they can 
still be defeated. Defense has to 
be a priority, or teams like UCLA 
will exploit it every time.
