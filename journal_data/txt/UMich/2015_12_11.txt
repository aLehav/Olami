Eleven members 
step down from 

their positions after 
chair’s termination

By EMMA KERR

Daily News Editor

The 
Central 
Student 

Government’s Campus Inclusion 
Commission, which aimed to 
address campus issues related 
to race, gender and the LGBTQ 
community, 
has 
effectively 

disbanded, 
following 
the 

resignation of 11 of the group’s 
members.

At last week’s CSG meeting, 

CSG President Cooper Charlton, 
an LSA senior, told the assembly 
that the commission’s chair, 
Matthew 
Fleisher, 
a 
School 

of Music, Theatre & Dance 
sophomore, had been terminated 
from his position. According to 
members of the commission, 
the 11 other members resigned 
shortly afterward in response.

During an interview Tuesday, 

CSG 
executives 
declined 
to 

answer questions related to the 
commission, and at this time, 
there is no active CSG commission 
related to diversity and inclusion.

Charlton 
did 
address 
the 

matter at the Dec. 1 CSG meeting, 

saying he and the body’s other 
executives stand by Fleisher’s 
termination, citing “deceptive 
behavior, the misrepresentation 
of facts, and racially charged 
statements to members of CSG 
staff and colleagues.”

Charlton 
addressed 
the 

situation after a Michigan in 
Color article, published in The 
Michigan Daily, criticized how 
the body’s executive leadership 
interacted with the commission 
and its members. The article 
was temporarily retracted, but 
an edited version has since been 
republished following additional 
review.

Fleisher provided a written 

statement 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 

Campus Inclusion Commission, 
but declined to further discuss 
the circumstances surrounding 
the resignations and termination 
or the commission’s future.

“The former Campus Inclusion 

Commission advocated for the 
inclusion of minority voices and 
perspectives in the common 
campus narrative, as well as 
the narrative within student 
government,” he wrote. “We are 
handling this situation with as 
much care for the community and 
ourselves with principles of truth, 
reconciliation, and justice. Going 
forward, we will continue our 
inclusionary work through other

 ‘U’, campaign not 
actively highlighting 
candidate’s time on 
Ann Arbor campus

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

With a third-place position 

in the Republican presidential 
primary, Ben Carson is not 

an unknown name for most 
Americans.

The now-presidential hopeful 

first made his mark as the 
first neurosurgeon to separate 
conjoined twins in 1987 — a feat 
rooted in the medical training 
he received at the University’s 
Medical School.

But while he’s known to many 

Americans, his alum status at the 
University isn’t as well known 
— and little has been done to 
connect the presidential-hopeful 

to his alma mater, by both the 
campaign and the University.

Until Wednesday, Carson had 

yet to visit Ann Arbor while on 
the campaign trail, and when he 
did, the visit was brief — a closed-
press meeting with Medical 
School leaders and students 
before a campaign stop in 
Ypsilanti and a fundraiser in Ann 
Arbor. The meeting on campus 
was closed per the University’s 
request, according to the Carson 
campaign.

Later in the day, Carson 

introduced 
his 
health 
care 

reform plans not on campus 
but 
30 
minutes 
away, 
at 

Eastern Michigan University in 
Ypsilanti. During previous visits 
to the state, Carson hasn’t visited 
Ann Arbor, and the University 
hasn’t made much mention of the 
candidate since he launched his 
campaign in May.

The 
University 
declined 

requests for comment about

LSA junior 

Shoham Geva to 
serve as paper’s 
editor in chief

By KATIE PENROD

Daily Staff Reporter

With 2016 around the corner, 

The Michigan Daily staff has 
selected its new editor in chief, 
managing editors and section 
leaders for the 2016 calendar 
year. The editor in chief and 
editorial page editors were 
chosen during a staff-wide 
election, while other positions 
were 
elected 
within 
each 

section.

LSA junior Shoham Geva, 

a senior news editor in 2015, 
will serve as editor in chief. 
Generally, her goal for the 
upcoming year is to move the 
Daily in a more digitally focused 
direction.

“Specifically, I’d like to focus 

a lot on our online presence,” 
she said. “Two of the initiatives 
I’m planning on pursuing right 
away are really defining what 
our 
social 
media 
presence 

looks like — so sitting down 
and creating a strategic plan 
about how we brand ourselves 
and how we promote ourselves. 
I’m also hoping to create a new 
position entirely focused on 
multimedia in recognition of 
the fact that it seems like a lot of 
newspapers have seemed to fold 
that more and more into their 
coverage.”

LSA junior Laura Schinagle 

will serve as managing editor, 
and echoed Geva’s thoughts 
about 
creating 
an 
online 

presence that caters to readers. 
She added that she wants to 
make every staff member feel 
welcome in the newsroom.

“One of our main initiatives 

is ramping up social media, 
something 
we’ve 
already 

started 
doing 
through 

Shoham’s strategic plan,” she 
said. “Also implementing more 
online packaging and working 
with web team to create more 
interactive things online.”

LSA 
junior 
Emma 
Kerr, 

the incoming managing news 
editor, said she hopes to foster 
more long-form investigative 
work 
with 
her 
reporters 

while continuing to engage

Warren, Irwin, 
Zemke focus on 
diverse range of 

policy goals in 2015

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

With the 2015 legislative 

session coming to a close, Ann 
Arbor’s 
representatives 
in 

the State House and Senate 

discussed the year’s successes 
and challenges as they played 
out in a Republican-controlled 
legislature.

State House
In January, Rep. Jeff Irwin 

(D–Ann Arbor) and Rep. Adam 
Zemke (D–Ann Arbor) spoketo 
The Michigan Daily about what 
they hoped to accomplish during 
the year. Both emphasized goals 
related to higher education 
funding, which has been in flux 
over the past five years. In 2011, 
Gov. Rick Snyder (R) cut state 

funding for higher education by 
almost 15 percent. Since then, he 
has proposed modest increases 
each 
year, 
though 
overall 

funding has not reached pre-
2011 levels.

With 
this 
year’s 
budget, 

higher education funding for 
the University increased by 1.9 
percent.

“We really have to work 

to preserve funding at the 
current levels,” Zemke said in 
January. “And really it should be

Research uses 

clips from trials to 
identify deceptive 

gestures, words

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily Staff Reporter

What does lying look like? Two 

University researchers believe 
they have found the answer.

Using video footage of high-

profile court trials and hearings, 
Rada Mihalcea, professor of 
computer science and electrical 
engineering, and Mihai Burzo, 
assistant professor of mechanical 
engineering at UM-Flint, are 
leading a project to build lie-
detecting software that can 
gauge 
deception 
through 
a 

speaker’s words and gestures.

Mihalcea said the research 

team first began developing the 
software by studying 120 video 
clips from media coverage of 
court trials. She said the team 
chose to analyze videos as part 
of building the software to add a 
real-life element to the software.

“I think that one of the 

challenges in doing the research 
on deception is that usually you 
get your data in lab, which is fine, 
but I think that people who come

Carson’s time at the University 
for this story. Mary Masson, a 
spokesperson for the University 
of Michigan Health system, also 
declined 
multiple 
interview 

requests to UMHS and Medical 
School faculty and administrators 
on their behalf.

Public 
Policy 
senior 
Cody 

Giddings, 
vice 
chair 
of 
the 

University’s 
chapter 
of 
the 

College Republicans, said the 
organization 
has 
not 
been 

in contact with the Carson 
campaign, and he does not foresee 
the candidate making an official 
visit to the University.

“I do not think Ann Arbor will 

be one of his future campaign 
stops, but anything is possible,” 
he said.

The 
majority 
of 
students 

approached for this article were 
not aware Carson had graduated 
from 
the 
University, 
though 

a large-scale survey was not 
conducted.

“I knew, but then again I 

wouldn’t expect most people to 
know that he graduated here,” said 
LSA senior Stephen Culbertson, 

communications director for the 
University’s chapter of College 
Democrats.

“Most people do not associate 

him with the University of 
Michigan as far as I know,” he 
said.

Political Science Prof. Michael 

Traugott 
agreed 
with 
that 

sentiment, noting that individuals 
in the University community 
are 
more 
familiar 
with 
his 

presidential campaign than his 
University roots.

“I don’t think he is well 

known as an alumnus because 
he graduated from the Medical 
School and that was about a 
generation ago,” Traugott said. 
“He’s much better known as a 
candidate than he is as an alum.”

Even those who do know him 

as a graduate said they do not 
associate him with the University 
— or believe he fully represents 
what the University stands for.

Medical 
School 
student 

Brian Desmond said though he 
knew Carson was a graduate 
of 
the 
University 
and 
his 

accomplishments as a doctor have 
made him a figure to be celebrated 
in the Medical School, he said 
Carson’s 
political 
beliefs 
are 

disheartening.

“The thing that I find kind of 

surprising, or that makes me a 
little bit sad, is that one of the 
things that brought me to U of 
M was the emphasis on kind of 
celebrating diversity,” Desmond 
said. “And I don’t think that those 
are things that Dr. Carson — at 
least in his political campaign — 
has represented well.”

Desmond 
also 
noted 
that 

while Carson’s medical career 
might align with the education 
emphases of the Medical School 
— 
such 
as 
evidence-based 

methodology 
— 
his 
political 

career has not.

“I 
think, 
unfortunately, 

and it might be because of the 
political climate he’s in, but I 
think unfortunately he kind of 
has a mixed record of actually 
doing that,” he said. “Some of his 
statements about climate change 
kind of go against what is the 
scientific consensus so I think 
his practices may be a little more 
mixed than what he said about 
using evidence.”

However, 
Medical 
School 

student Ben Long said he knew 
Carson was a graduate and felt the 

fact was well regarded. Ever since 
reading Carson’s autobiography, 
“Gifted Hands,” the doctor has 
been highly influential on Long’s 
life. Long said Carson’s story is 
the “main reason” he decided to 
go into medicine, and he has now 
attended the same undergraduate 
and medical school as Carson.

“I’d say he’s one of our best-

known graduates,” Long said. 
“He is obviously really successful 
in the field of neurosurgery, 
he’s running for president and I 
think that reflects highly on the 
Medical School because the sort 
of motto is ‘the leaders and the 
best’ and he’s one of our probably 
most prominent graduates but 
also one of our most prominent 
minority graduates.”

One of Carson’s draws to many 

Republican voters are his strong 
religious ties, which a number 
of news outlets have contrasted 
with his scientific background.

However, 
many 
students 

interviewed said they didn’t think 
those contrasts — for example, 
Carson has expressed a belief in 
creationism — have had much of 

an impact on people’s perceptions 
of the candidate.

“His life story and how he rose 

from poverty, and he worked 
really hard to go to school, I 
think it’s really inspiring,” Long 
said. “I don’t entirely agree with 
his creationist views, but it is his 
religion though so I can sort of 
understand why that is ... I don’t 
think it reflects badly on him.”

Traugott said he didn’t think 

being both a doctor and strongly 
religious 
individual 
would 

necessarily present issues with 
regard to public opinion.

“There must be a wide range 

of 
religious 
beliefs 
among 

doctors, and he has a particular 
one which he apparently has 
had throughout his career,” he 
said. “We won’t know until they 
start voting in the primaries and 
caucuses how attractive they are 
to Republicans.”

Traugott also noted the fact 

that being a Michigan alum 
wasn’t 
necessarily 
something 

that would be a draw or a negative 
for voters.

Culbertson said he believes 

most Republican candidates don’t 
appeal to University students, 
and Carson isn’t an exception.

“As far as the student body 

is concerned, I don’t really 
believe that Ben Carson appeals 
to Michigan students, despite 
what people say about students 
not being involved or engaged 
in politics,” he said. “He’s kind 
of an appeal gap here and I don’t 
think the University association 
is going to be able to overcome 
that.”

Students who support the 

Republican Party said Carson’s 
alum status is also not a draw, 
though they noted there were 
many other reasons they could 
have for supporting him.

“Carson’s accomplishments in 

the medical field as a University 
of Michigan Medical School 
graduate certainly serve as a 
source of pride for those that 
support him within the University 
of Michigan College Republicans 
but I believe his political policies 
are the primary reason some in 
UMCR support him.”

increased, but especially given 
a budget deficit of $460 million, 
you’re talking about a lot of items 
that we have to watch.”

Irwin said in an interview 

Thursday 
that 
he 
deemed 

expanding 
financial 
aid 
a 

priority, but he was disappointed 
that this priority wasn’t largely 
reflected in the final budget.

“Michigan is currently 41st 

in the nation by most estimates 
in terms of providing financial 
aid,” Irwin said. “Efforts to move 
Michigan up the ladder, to try to 
get Michigan out of the basement 
in funding for financial aid were 
rebuffed.” 

Irwin also identified several 

other 
priorities 
in 
January, 

including 
bolstering 
clean 

energy 
production 
and 

improving energy efficiency 
in the state, as well as several 
social justice measures.

Speaking 
about 
those 

priorities Thursday, Irwin said 
he believed one of the most 
important pieces of legislature 
passed this year was a bill 
relating to criminal justice, 
which he co-sponsored.

The bill, passed by the 

Michigan 
House, 
would 

prevent prisons from holding 
prisoners past their sentences. 
The bill is currently being 
considered in the Senate.

“Michigan is one of the 

toughest states for parole,” he 
said. “What we are basically 
saying to the parole board is 
if you want to keep somebody 
past their release date then 
you have to justify it, and in 
the future that could save the 
state hundreds of millions of 
dollars.”

Irwin has also introduced 

several bills relating to the 
environment, including House 
Bill 
4512, 
which 
imposes 

regulations on the construction 
of oil and natural gas pipelines, 
and House Bill 5116, which 

promotes home-based renewable 
energy production.

several 
priorities 

in January along with higher 
education 
funding, 
including 

supporting 
students 
and 

educators.

He introduced legislation this 

year addressing the standards 
for the kinds of support services 
offered to students and parents 
by schools.

Zemke 
also 
introduced 

several other bills over the 
session, 
including 
proposals 

allowing 
same-sex 
couples 

married in another state to have 
their 
marriages 
recognized 

in Michigan, changing how 
veterans 
relief 
funds 
are 

distributed and making election 
days a state holiday.

Overall, Irwin said, many of 

his legislative priorities weren’t 
realized to the extent he would 
have hoped due to the current 
GOP majority in Lansing. The 
Michigan House is currently 
Republican-controlled 
by 
a 

margin of 16; the Michigan 
Senate stands at 27 Republicans, 
11 Democrats.

“I don’t want to be too 

negative,” he said. “But the 
reality 
is 
with 
Republicans 

having overwhelming control of 
the legislature, and particularly 
very conservative Republicans, it 
is hard to imagine that we would 
actually do the things I spent a 
lot of my time advocating for.”

State Senate
In the Senate, state Sen. 

Rebekah 
Warren’s 
(D–Ann 

Arbor) 
priorities 
had 
some 

similarities to her colleagues 
in the House — she identified 
the environment as a particular 

focus — but featured some unique 
policy areas as well, including 
mental health.

Warren 
said 
one 
of 
her 

biggest 
accomplishments 

in the legislature this year 
was aiding in the passage of 
the 
bipartisan 
Great 
Lakes 

Restoration 
Initiative, 
which 

requests more funding from the 
federal government for proper 
preservation of the Great Lakes.

“It would work on the cleanup 

of pollution sites and do habitat 
reconstruction to make sure we 
are doing everything we can to 
protect the Great Lakes, so I was 
really thrilled that we could pass 
that,” she said.

Warren also noted the success 

of a bill she sponsored that allows 
for citizens with family members 
with mental illnesses to set up 
savings accounts for them. Prior 
to the passage of this bill, many 

in that situation would lose 
access to federal support if they 
had any money in savings.

“What 
we 
know 
is 
for 

those folks to have as much 
independence as they can ever 
have, they need to have some 
funds saved up to help them with 
that, so I was really excited to 
see that get passed into law,” she 
said.

Despite 
the 
Republican 

control, she said, she was still 
able to find some successes 
during the year.

“I would say for myself, 

the fact that I am in a super-
minority — I am the only woman 
Democrat in the Senate — and I 
can still say that I have bills that 
were signed into laws, that is to 
me a positive sign that I am still 
able to get things done in this 
climate,” she said.

to the lab to contribute data do not 
have those high stakes settings that 
you would have in a court setting, 
like if you were defending your life,” 
she said. “So that’s the reason why 
we wanted real data when people 
are truly lying.”

The videos include testimony 

from both defendants and witnesses. 
By comparing the testimony to the 
court’s verdict, the researchers 
deemed which subjects were being 
deceptive. Through the comparison, 
researchers found half of the clips 
featured deceptive subjects.

Mihalcea said the team also used 

some clips from The Innocence 
Project, a national organization that 
works to reexamine cases where 
individuals were tried without the 
benefit of DNA testing with the aim 
of exonerating wrongfully convicted 
individuals.

“The Innocence Project is all 

about people being exonerated, so 
they have people who eventually 
tell the truth though they were 
believed to tell a lie,” Mihalcea said. 
“So in our data, there would be data 
points with that truth label. That 
data would show people who were 
actually saying the truth.”

After the team gauged deception 

by comparing the court’s verdict 
with the testimony, the researchers 
analyzed body language in the clips, 
specifically looking for common 
behaviors 
in 
subjects 
deemed 

deceptive.

Mihalcea said the team referred 

to common deceptive gestures 
identified in prior research when 
analyzing the subjects. 

According to a press release, 

the researchers found that 70 
percent of the deceptive subjects 
looked directly at the questioner 
when answering questions. They 
also found that 40 percent of the 
deceptive subjects often gestured 
with both hands.

Mihalcea said after identifying 

common gestures, researchers then 
transcribed the audio from the 
video clips of trials and analyzed 
how often subjects labeled deceptive 
used various words and phrases.

“We extracted individual words 

and groups of words,” she said. “For 
instance, there is a group of words 
that reflect positive feelings, or 
there is a group of words that would 
reflect certainty. We looked for the 
presence of words that would belong 
to these categories.”

By 
analyzing 
the 
speaker’s 

common 
gestures 
and 
words 

together, 
the 
researchers 
then 

determined which overall behaviors 
were typical for deceptive subjects.

After feeding the results of the 

study into the software system, 
Mihalcea said the rubric of deceptive 
behaviors was 75-percent accurate 
in identifying which subjects were 
deceptive among the 120 videos 
originally studied. 

Though 
Mihalcea 
said 
the 

research 
team 
considered 
the 

software successful in the prototype 
stage, she noted there were still 
improvements to be made — in 
particular, enhancing the formula to 
consider cultural and demographic 
differences.

Burzo wrote in a press release 

that 
examining 
cultural 
and 

demographic differences adds a 
different perspective in deception 
research.

“Deception detection is a very 

difficult problem,” he said. “We are 
getting at it from several different 
angles.”

Beyond the courtroom, Mihalcea 

said, there might also be other 
applications to which the software 
can be adapted, such as job 
interviews.

“It could be helpful in situations 

where there is an interaction with 
people and it is important to know 
when the other side is telling the 
truth,” she said. “I think a system 
like this would give clues, or at 
least give an indication that there 
is a chance that this person is lying, 
which, whatever the context would 
be, humans could make use of.”

the community and produce 
quality work with thorough 
editing.

“I believe the quality and 

ethical standards we hold 
ourselves to in the news 
section are impressive, and as 
managing news editor, I plan 
to continue that tradition,” 
Kerr said. “Our goal in the 
news section, in my opinion, is 
to inform the public, creating 
a 
more 
engaged 
student 

community on campus. 

“This year, I’ll be focusing on 

moving toward an online-first 
model so we can best reach our 
audience while maintaining a 
consistent print paper — the 
only daily print paper in Ann 
Arbor,” she added. “I’ll also 
be working to better train 
the next generation of Daily 
reporters 
and 
journalists, 

encourage 
strengthened 

relationships 
with 
sources, 

and facilitate a challenging and 
inclusive community of student 
journalists.”

Incorporating a broad array 

of voices will be a priority 
for LSA sophomore Regan 
Detwiler and LSA junior Claire 
Bryan, incoming editorial page 
editors. They both said more 
active recruitment for the 
section will play an essential 
role in reaching this goal.

“Claire and I really want to 

be leaders in innovation and 
in increasing diversity on the 
Daily, especially within the 
Opinion section. We want as 
many voices to be heard as 
possible,” Detwiler said. “We 
also see ourselves as part of 
student newspaper that needs 
to be on the cutting edge of 
journalism, doing new things 
with web and increasing the 
variety of content we have to 
appeal to more readers.”

LSA junior Jake Lourim 

and Public Policy junior Max 
Bultman hope to create a 
welcoming environment for 
their writers as co-managing 
sports editors. This is Lourim’s 
second year in this position and 
Bultman’s first. Bultman said 
he feels he owes it to the section 
to step up to this role.

“I think it’s important to 

continue to grow our staff 
and keep good opportunities 
for people so that we have a 

foundation for the future,” 
Lourim said. “I think it’s also 
important to create a good 
atmosphere within the section 
so that everyone feels welcome 
and everyone feels like they’re 
contributing. Doing this again, 
I loved doing it the first time, 
had a great co-editor, (Business 
senior) Max Cohen, and I really 
liked the responsibility, liked 
being involved at the Daily, 
liked covering football — which 
I got to do this year. I’m excited 
to give it another go.”

For 
LSA 
juniors 
Emily 

Campbell and Alexis Nowicki, 
their collective passion for the 
Daily combined with their love 
of grammar will help them 
lead their section as co-copy 
chiefs, and create an open, 
collaborative section, they said.

“I ran because I love the 

Daily and I love the Copy Desk 
— I’ve been a part of it since my 
freshman year,” Campbell said. 
“It’s a really great community 
and I think that ties into my 
goals because what I’d really 
love is for the Copy Desk to be 
a community in and of itself 
and part of The Michigan Daily 
community. A goal would be to 
try and foster that community 
for everyone.”

Incoming managing photo 

editors, LSA junior Amanda 
Allen and LSA sophomore 
Grant Hardy, hope to produce 
strong visual narratives for the 
stories the Daily runs.

“My goals for next year 

are to continue to put out 
quality content,” Allen said. 
“I think that Photo is a great 
opportunity for photographers 
to get a lot of experience and 
learn from other people so I 
want to keep that tradition 
going.”

LSA juniors Adam Theisen 

and 
Kathleen 
Davis 
hope 

that their love for the Daily 
will be reflected in their 
new roles as co-managing 
arts editors — which Davis 
said is representative of the 
duo’s overall commitment to 
journalism.

“Adam and I have a very 

similar trajectory because we 
both started very soon during 
our freshman year,” Davis said. 
“We both became senior arts 
editors last year and we both 
love the Daily. This is what I 
want to do in my life, and Adam 
I think is the same.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Anjali 

Alangaden was selected for the 

position of managing design 
editor, and will be joined by 
Art & Design senior Mariah 
Gardziola for Winter 2016 and 
Art & Design junior Francesca 
Kielb for Fall 2016.

“In the coming year, there 

are a lot of things that the 
design section would like to 
focus on,” Alangaden said. “Of 
course, we want to continue 
producing 
innovative 
and 

interesting layouts and for the 
feature sections like B-side and 
SportsMonday, but we are also 
working to update the overall 
design of the paper, especially 
the front page. The layout and 
design of the paper plays a huge 
role in attracting interest and 
we want to make sure we are 
staying up to date.”

The 
current 
semester’s 

editors for Michigan in Color 
— 
Engineering 
graduate 

student Ryan Moody and LSA 
seniors Sarah Khan, De’Mario 
Longmire and Gabby Vasquez 
— will continue to hold their 
positions until their section 
selects 
new 
leadership 
in 

February.

LSA junior Nivedita Karki 

will serve as next year’s online 
editor, and said she hopes to 
create a teaching community 
within the web team through 
new innovative ideas.

“We’re working on two 

apps right now,” Karki said. 
“We’re working on a concept 
app for The Michigan Daily 
and 
the 
other 
app 
we’re 

working on is a ‘marketplace.’ 
It’s definitely been a learning 
process for everybody. More 
than anything, I think the 
team needs to be a productive 
learning experience.”

The Daily video section will 

be led by LSA sophomore Levin 
Kim. The Statement Magazine 
will be led by LSA junior Karl 
Williams.

“I want the Statement to 

be an intellectual forum that 
will foster critical inquiry in 
the Ann Arbor and University 
community,” Williams said. 
“I hope to give a voice to 
underrepresented racial, social 
and economic groups in both 
print and, hopefully, in video. 
Specifically, I want to work 
with the homeless community, 
which I think lacks a voice, and 
I would love to make a short 
documentary on the issues 
they not only face, but live with 
every day.”

avenues with the embodiment of 
these principals.”

This 
semester, 
the 
CSG 

Executive Committee chose to 
consolidate commissions related 
to diversity, equity and inclusion 
into a single Campus Inclusion 

Committee. The decision was part 
of a larger strategy to pare down 
the number of commissions from 
19 to eight.

Charlton told the CSG assembly 

Dec. 1 that the decision was made 
because there were too many 
committees to function effectively, 
and grouping similar initiatives 
and issues under an umbrella 
commission would increase its 
efficiency.

Senate votes in 
favor of education 
overhaul bill 

The Every Student Succeeds 

Act passed in the United States 
Senate Wednesday, after passing 
in the House of Representatives 
last week.

The act is an overhaul of No 

Child Left Behind and is the first 
major education bill to be passed 
since President George W. Bush 
signed the expired education 
policy reform program into law 
in 2002. 

According to The Huffington 

Post, the Every Student Suceeds 
Act maintains many of the policies 
No Child Left Behind establsihed, 
but the new act gives more power 
to the states as opposed to the 
federal government. 

Like they were in No Child 

Left Behind, the act still requires 
annual math and reading exams 
for students in third through 
eighth grade and in one year 
during high school. Unlike the 
expired 
education 
program, 

however, the act allows states 
to decide for themselves how to 
evaluate their teachers and how 
they hold schools accountable for 
their students’ performance. 

MSU student 
facing terrorism 
charges for threats

Michigan 
State 
University 

student Sydney Gort currently 
faces charges for two counts of 
“making a terrorist threat,” both 
of which she reported to police. 

According to the Detroit Free 

Press, Gort’s first terror threat 
was a bomb threat against MSU 
in the Douglas J Aveda Institute 
in August 2012. 

In her threat she wrote, “I have 

had enough of this school and the 
associated peoples … ” 

The student made the second 

threat inside a bathroom stall 
in MSU’s School of Packaging 
building on Nov. 24, writing she 
would “be administering the first 
act of terrorism on this campus 
… striking every third girl seen.” 
Gort reported her threat to the 
police at 5 p.m. that day. 

The student was arrested last 

month and faces charges for both 
of her threats. She faces up to 20 
years for each count. 

An Ingham County District 

Court judge has Gort’s bond set 
at $100,000. Her next hearing is 
Dec. 18.

Third former 
SAM member 
given community 
service, probation

University 
alum 
Daniel 

Orleans is the third former 
brother of the now-disbanded 
University 
fraternity 
Sigma 

Alpha Mu to be sentenced for 
malicious destruction of property 
at Treetops Resort, which was 
vandalized 
by 
the 
fraternity 

last January, the Petoskey News 
reported.

Orleans pled guilty to the 

charges on Monday, and was 
sentenced Thursday.

Orleans faces two years of 

probation, $5,000 in restitution 
charges, 100 community service 
hours and court fines worth 
around $860.

Orleans’ sentencing follows 

that 
of 
University 
alumni 

Matthew 
Vlasic 
and 
Jesse 

Krumholz, 
the 
two 
other 

members of SAM who were 
charged with the destruction of 
Treetops. The three members 
were 
handed 
down 
nearly 

identical sentences.

The restitution cost Orleans 

paid was instituted to cover a 
portion of the $25,000 insurance 
deductible 
paid 
by 
Treetops 

Resort to cover damages inflicted 
by SAM. The resort estimated that 
more than $200,000 in property 
damages were perpetrated during 
SAM’s January stay.

The University’s chapter of the 

Sigma Delta Tau sorority, which 
is 
currently 
suspended, 
also 

attended the ski trip.

Campus united for divestment

DIVEST AND INVEST | VIEWPOINT

W

hether it’s the end of 
the current semester or 
the beginning of a new 

one, 
it 
seems 

there’s no end 
to the list of 
things we find to 
stress ourselves 
out about. From 
underclassmen 
who 
are 
still 

learning 
the 

ropes to upper-
classmen 
who 

are eagerly try-
ing to get their 
last 
remaining 

distribution requirements out of 
the way, there’s a lot to get done and 
seemingly never enough time to 
squeeze it all in.

At the start of this semester, 

when I found myself showered in 
more syllabi and pending deadlines 
than I knew what to do with, I just 
told myself there would be enough 
time over the next couple of months 
to get everything done. Most of my 
pending deadlines were still far 
away, anywhere from weeks (for the 
first essays I would need to write) 
to months (for my midterm and 
final exams). Some matters were a 
little more pressing, needing to be 
taken care of ASAP — namely, get-
ting my hands on the coursepacks 
and textbooks that contained read-
ings for class sessions less than a 
week away. With regard to the rest, 
I took a deep breath, took another 
look at the syllabi I’d been given and 
decided, at least for the time being, 
to let everything slide. I would let 
things play out as they wanted and 
see where that took me.

Now, with finals weeks almost 

here, I find myself in this same 
mentality, 
and, 
oddly 
enough, 

utterly lacking in stress. Perhaps 
that will pick up over the next cou-
ple of days when I’m studying for 
and taking my finals, but somehow 
I don’t really think so. It has been 
my experience that things balance 
one another out. If I read a little 

bit or hammer out an essay draft 
on Saturday and save other assign-
ments for Sunday so I can shop for 
groceries instead of studying, I’m 
left at no disadvantage come Mon-
day morning. Similarly, leaving my 
reading untouched at the end of a 
long Friday has no lasting repercus-
sions.

That has been the case across 

numerous semesters, not just this 
one. Saturday is not for homework 
— it’s for down time, though there 
have been some exceptions. Again 
and again, I keep coming back to 
a memory from last fall, when the 
due date for a draft of my next 
paper for my First Year Writing 
Requirement course was approach-
ing. That weekend, I spent almost 
my entire Saturday in my room, 
wearing a fleece blanket and stand-
ing at my dresser, the surface in my 
house that’s closest in height to a 
standing desk. There, I wrote my 
way through page after page of raw 
concepts and unrefined ideas. After 
long hours, I’d drafted almost 1,000 
more words than I needed, and over 
the next couple of weeks, I sanded 
that excess down bit by bit. In the 
end, I arrived at an essay that I still 
look back on as one of the strongest 
samples of my academic writing.

For that long Saturday in October, 

it didn’t matter that I had a collage 
due for my art class or a case study 
for my class on sustainable agricul-
ture. I did them the day after, and 
came into the week in much the same 
standing I would have been in had I 
chosen to get those tasks out of the 
way on Saturday morning instead of 
Sunday afternoon.

In my handouts from a CAPS 

workshop 
on 
managing 
stress, 

there’s a list of suggestions for activi-
ties that can help to balance out a 
load of academic tasks. These other 
options include tidying your room or 
your corner of the apartment; tak-
ing the time to prepare a meal for 
yourself; or generally cleaning your 
house. I’ve found that it can also 
be beneficial to take a little break 

from your immediate environment 
by going to do something fun with 
friends. And here’s something else 
that’s never a bad idea: reading for 
fun. Or going for a walk, or, oh yeah, 
getting to the gym.

For me, I still don’t always man-

age to practice these fun and very 
necessary tasks with quite as 
much regularity as I’d like, but I 
keep them in the back of my head. 
Throughout each day and over the 
course of weeks and months, I work 
to keep academic work in check by 
balancing it with everything else.

By doing so, I think I also help 

those around me to practice a 
healthy balancing act of their own. 
Whether it’s because I am able 
to help cook dinner one night or 
because I need quiet for my home-
work and we all work on academic 
things at the same time, the way 
I choose to best use my time can 
have an impact on others. By keep-
ing track of when my school work 
is due, I’m able to communicate 
clearly about it, and talking about 
assignments can help to reduce 
my own stress around them. Yes, I 
have reading, but also, yes, I’ll help 
with dishes and come with you to the 
farmers market this morning. No, I 
can’t come over today, but how about 
tomorrow? Sorry, I can’t walk the 
dog now — I’m working on a paper 
— but don’t worry, I took her half an 
hour ago and we had a great time.

More and more, I’m coming to 

believe in the idea of making time for 
the things I need in my life, not tak-
ing time. Time for necessary chores, 
but also for family and friends, for 
gym dates, for video games, for scrib-
bling one quick page of the novel I’m 
writing. And while there may be a 
piece of reading or an essay draft or 
a final somewhere in my future, I can 
be confident I’ll make the time for 
studying tomorrow.

Sometimes, other things are just 

a little more important.

Last Friday, University President 

Mark Schlissel wrote a letter from 
the Office of the President titled 
“Addressing Climate Change as a 
Powerful Community.” We thank 
Schlissel for taking an important 
step to open a public dialogue 
around divestment. This is the first 
public response during our four-
year campaign explaining why our 
university is not joining the nearly 
500 other institutions worldwide 
that have committed to divesting 
from fossil fuel industries.

Schlissel’s 
arguments 
are 

unsound. Regarding the two pre-
vious instances of divestment in 
University history — the tobacco 
industry and apartheid — he stat-
ed, “In the previous two instances 
where we eventually divested, the 
investments … were inextricably 
linked to immoral and unethical 
actions and ideologies” and that 
fossil fuels are different because 
they “...enable us to operate the 
university, to conduct research and 
to provide patient care.” He is cor-
rect regarding our reliance on fossil 
fuels, but he fails to address the issue 
of whether the fossil fuel industry is 
morally suspect. Fossil fuel combus-
tion is causing climate change that 
will have adverse, disproportionate 
and irreversible effects on billions of 
people — mostly on women, people 
of color and others who have con-
tributed little to the problem. 

Despite having known about 

these threats for decades, fossil fuel 
companies have contributed to cli-
mate denialism by funding lobby-
ing groups that, for instance, spread 
disinformation about climate sci-
ence. Disinformation campaigns are 
antithetical to the values of institu-
tions like the University, and these 
companies must be held account-
able for their unethical and immoral 
practices (see the New York attorney 
general’s recent investigation into 
Exxon Mobil). 

As to the inevitableness of rely-

ing on fossil fuels, recall that the 
past few years have bolstered the 
competitiveness of renewables; the 

actions of various financial decision 
makers are foreshadowing a major 
energy transition. For example, 
Allianz, the world’s largest insur-
ance company, divested from coal 
last month. The fact that we all are 
still reliant on fossil fuels underlines 
the urgency of shifting our energy 
vision and infrastructure. Divest-
ment catalyzes this shift.

The University currently lacks 

autonomy over energy infrastruc-
ture, but we do have autonomy over 
financial decisions. These deci-
sions matter to the world beyond 
Ann Arbor. The main argument for 
divestment is that “if it’s wrong to 
cause climate change, it’s wrong to 
profit from causing climate change.” 
So far, nearly 500 institutions have 
acted on this clarion call by pledg-
ing to divest more than $3.4 trillion 
from fossil fuels.

This is just the beginning. The 

choice of divesting declares that — 
along with other positive initiatives 
that President Schlissel has champi-
oned — we are committed to build-
ing and ethically financing a more 
sustainable world. 

President Schlissel’s second point 

is that divestment isn’t an effective 
tool for transitioning to a clean ener-
gy future. It is unlikely that actions 
taken by a leading public university 
in the country would go unnoticed. 
When the University acts, many in 
the world listen. To say that divest-
ing would have no influence on 
other institutions and no impact in 
speeding the transition to cleaner 
energy ignores the University’s 
influence and obligation. Aligned 
with 
our 
country’s 
democratic 

process, divestment is a vote for a 
cleaner energy future — it serves as 
an opportunity for universities to 
engage in a public dialogue about a 
just energy transition and to stand 
in solidarity with those most hurt by 
climate change.

Lastly, President Schlissel said, 

“... the endowment should not be 
used to further other causes, how-
ever noble.” First, it is difficult 
to reconcile this statement with 

Schlissel’s acknowledgement of the 
precedent set by the University’s 
two past divestment actions. These 
actions paved the way for consider-
ing divestment when “...a particu-
lar issue involves serious moral or 
ethical questions which are of con-
cern to many members of the Uni-
versity community.” Our campaign 
has exposed the moral implications 
of supporting fossil fuel industries. 
Resolutions passed by the Central 
Student Government and the Senate 
Assembly in support of our position 
urge the Board of Regents to form a 
committee to examine divestment.

Clearly, this issue is “of concern 

to many members of the Univer-
sity community.” Moreover, to see 
any of the University’s divestment 
campaigns as attempts to use the 
endowment to further other causes 
misrepresents the argument that the 
University should divest in order to 
respect the moral constraints inher-
ent in the pursuit of its mission, not 
in order to further other causes that 
are extrinsic to this mission.

President 
Schlissel’s 
article 

expresses his personal view on 
the issue of fossil fuel divestment. 
The University, though, has clearly 
defined an objective, three-pronged 
standard that when met, warrants 
the formation of an ad hoc commit-
tee to examine any divestment issue 
of interest to University students and 
faculty. We have met this standard.

Because of organized support for 

fossil fuel divestment on campus 
and the University’s unmistakable 
role in a globally conscious society, 
we request that President Schlis-
sel and the Board of Regents hold a 
public meeting to continue discus-
sions on this critical issue in an open 
manner. The formation of an ad hoc 
committee is clearly warranted.

There’s enough time for everything

FROM THE DAILY

A correction, qualified

Course evaluations must be released by the University
I

n an editorial last month titled “Release course evaluation 
data,” the Editorial Board stated that “course evaluations were 
created as a method of improving professor performance rather 

than a tool for scheduling classes.” This statement is incorrect. 
Course evaluations were created in 1969 by students, for students, 
as an effort toward a more informed course selection process.

Despite this error, our original argument 

— that course evaluation data must be 
available to students — still stands because 
over time, course evaluations turned to 
focusing on improving teacher performance. 
The reality is that today, students wish to 
use course evaluation data to become more 
knowledgeable when registering for classes.

The University has a responsibility to 

release the course evaluation data. It’s true the 
data is publicly available through a Freedom 
of Information Act request, but again, 
obtaining this data is a challenging and time-
consuming task. That said, the data’s release 
should be prefaced by the acknowledgement 
that the evaluations are currently used as a 
teaching improvement tool. 

If faculty are concerned that the survey in 

its current form cannot or should not be used 
to aid students in registering for courses, 
then the University should invest resources 
in developing a survey that meets the 
needs of students and the wishes of faculty. 
Measures that increase course evaluation 
completion should also be highly considered 
in order to reduce the response bias that can 
result when few students in a large course 
complete the evaluation. 

As we wrote previously, if done correctly, 

releasing course evaluation data should not 
be a contentious issue. Ultimately, this is a 
matter of transparency, and being open with 
course evaluation data works to the benefit 
of the University, faculty and students. 

I 

have a confession: I never took a guided 
college tour of the University. Or really 
of any other school.

There just weren’t really 

any other colleges I had 
much interest in going to. 
With two University alum-
ni parents and living close 
enough to campus to visit 
Ann Arbor often, it never 
occurred to me that I’d ever 
need a tour. I was lucky 
enough to be accepted here 
and just showed up — no 
Campus Day or anything.

It’s not that I haven’t vis-

ited campuses elsewhere. 
I think college campuses 
are wonderful places, each with not only its 
own unique layout and architecture, but also 
with its own culture. When I was out in the 
San Francisco Bay Area for a prospective job 
a few months ago, I went out for a little over 
a day just to walk around Stanford to observe 
something different than my own campus 
experience in Ann Arbor. My other memories 
of roaming around other college campuses as 
I traveled to watch Michigan football games 
are much better than the scoreboard, as I’ve 
yet to actually see a road win. I just never 
had a guided tour and left it up to myself to 
explore and discover.

Therefore, it’s only natural that I’m slightly 

intrigued when I see the packs of high school 
students and their families roaming the 
campus, looking as out of place as they do. I 
was never one of them; it was an experience 
I simply skipped. So to compensate for not 
having gone on a campus tour myself in high 
school, I decided to stop and listen with the 
tour groups at a couple spots around campus 
because I am a senior and allowed to do what-
ever the heck I want to waste time.

I learned things on the tour that I didn’t 

know despite all of my time at this campus. 
Friday tea at Betsy Barbour Residence Hall is 
actually a thing. Apparently there’s an urban 
legend that the Law Quadrangle was a back-
up filming location for Hogwarts. And people 
erroneously believe there’s a University of 
Michigan flag on the moon. I wanted to ask a 
tour guide if I’m allowed to step on the block 
‘M’ if I’ve never taken a single blue book exam 
in my entire college career here, but decided 
there has to be some other stipulation in the 
curse for engineers.

More intriguing than touring the build-

ings I live, work and play in every day were 

the people on the tour. There were the high 
school students, some clearly from some-
where down south and dressed way too warm 
for 35-degree weather. There were com-
pletely uninterested, younger siblings being 
dragged along. And then there were the loud-
est members of the tour: the parents. There 
was the overzealous parent overly concerned 
with whether her most beloved and precious 
possession (their child) was going to get into 
this school, pestering people with questions, 
having memorized GPAs, SAT scores and 
whatnot. There was another who saw a red 
cup left over from a football Saturday tailgate 
and became instantly concerned about her 
kid partying. There was the parent who asked 
a question about every single building.

And then there were the alumni parents. 

They remarked on how the UGLi was actually 
ugly when they went here before its remod-
eling, how they lived in the Law Library, 
how lucky the freshmen are to live in dorm 
rooms upgraded from glorified walk-in clos-
ets to air-conditioned glorified walk-in clos-
ets. They were walking “back in my day” 
machines, proudly adorned with Michigan 
hats and shirts. The campus has changed, but 
the memories remained.

In a few short months, I’ll be an alum of 

this university, too. I’m fortunate enough to 
have a job, no doubt due to the prestige of 
this school. That reputation is directly tied 
to those alumni who one day bring their chil-
dren on these tours, where they walk through 
and remember the hours toiled in libraries, 
the club meetings in the Michigan Union 
and the fun all over the rest of campus. The 
value of my degree and every diploma issued 
by this institution is directly tied to the value 
contributed by them here, and so too does the 
standing and character of this school rely on 
all those who don a cap and gown in the Big 
House. It comes full circle.

The tours will always keep coming, the 

applications pouring in, the prospective stu-
dents walking into our libraries as we study 
and roaming our campus among us. I might 
never have been one of them, but perhaps the 
very people on that tour, the kids and par-
ents alike who will and have attended, are 
the ones on whom I am dependent to uphold 
the reputation of the University. What has 
been built through the years before us must 
continue after, and I feel lucky to be a part 
of that.

VS Fashion show:
The good and bad

STYLE RECAP

Glitz, gold and 

tans for this year’s 

Angels

By Daily Style Writers

At the Victoria’s Secret Fash-

ion Show, there was music, bras, 
Kris Jenner being a “cool” mom 
and the sensual sounds of the 
Weeknd, what more could you 
ask for?

BEST: Kendall Jenner
Kendall Jenner seems to absorb 

a crowd’s attention whenever she’s 
on the runway. Maybe it’s her 
stunning beauty, the mass amount 
of attention placed on the Kar-
dashian/Jenner clan or a mix of 
both. Either way, as Jenner made 
her debut as an angel she was the 
highlight of the show’s first cat-
walk routine. Donning underwear, 
bra and corset that were brought 
to life by their rich primary color 
pattern, Jenner took it to the 
next level with a flowing skirt, an 
aggressively large gold necklace 
and custom-made Brian Atwood 
platform sandals. As she posed at 
the end of the runway Kris Jenner 
snapped pics and Caitlyn Jenner 
teared up. —Christian Kennedy

WORST: Ellie Goulding
Ellie Goulding was clearly the 

weak link in Tuesday night’s run-
way show. The Weeknd brought 
sensuality and his singular look 
with “Into The Night” and “Can’t 
Feel My Face” while Selena Gomez 
stunned the crowd during her 
performance of “Me & My Girls.” 
And while Goulding vocally suc-
ceeded, her dress failed to emulate 
the glitz of the show. Loaded with 
metal embezzlements and two-
too-many straps, her black, red 
and white dress failed to flatter the 
pop-singer. Nonetheless, her song 
choices of “Army” and “Love Me 
Like You Do” brought just the right 
sound. — Christian Kennedy

BEST: Elsa Hosk

The wonderful part of the 

VS show is the delicate balance 
between amazing underwear and 
lavish ensembles. Sadly, this year 
only a few lingerie pieces looked 
beautifully crafted as is typical of 
VS. One exception would be Elsa 
Hosk’s Winter Wonderland look 
that featured a delicately embroi-
dered white bodysuit with an 
elegant cutout and striking neck-
line. The enormous white furry 
earmuffs and mittens were a major 
plus, as were the glistening jewels 
around her neck. The true Queen 
Elsa, Hosk glided down the run-
way like an ice princess with snow-
flakes sprouting from her tanned 
body, putting us all into the holiday 
spirit with every step of her knee-
high fur boots. — Mara Maclean

BEST: Selena Gomez
In my book, Selena Gomez 

stole the show on Tuesday night. 
Wearing a deep plunging Jolibe 
Atelier gown with a high-slit and 
cut outs, Selena outshined every 
model that walked by her. Don’t 
get me wrong, I think the Victo-
ria’s Secret Models are beautiful 
women. But there is something 
to be said for women who know 
how to show the curves they’ve 
got. Selena was absolutely the 
real “Angel” that night. —Julia 
Doyle

WORST: Gigi Hadid (as a fire-

fighter)

Being in the VS Fashion Show is 

obviously a huge honor for all mod-
els. For Gigi Hadid, I’m sure that 
was no different. After months of 
training and dieting in prepara-
tion for the show, I’d be ecstatic 
to flaunt my unbelievable body in 
some million-dollar bra and tiny 
panties. Unfortunately for Gigi, she 
got the honor of wearing a sports 
bra and weirdly wide firefighter 
pants. Not only was that a let down 
for Gigi, but it didn’t seem to fit the 
typical look of the VS show. It’s safe 
to say that I am slightly disappoint-
ed. — Julia Doyle

BEST: Maria Borges

Maria Borges made history at 

this year’s Victoria’s Secret Fash-
ion Show. She is the first model to 
wear her hair completely natural 
for the fashion show (except for 
some hairspray). Borges looked 
absolutely stunning in her pink, 
yellow and blue feather peacock-
inspired “wings.” Walking the 
arguably biggest fashion show 
sans extensions shows that Borg-
es has confidence in herself — 
something even more beautiful 
than the lingerie and wings she 
was wearing. — Carly Colonnese

WORST: Gigi Hadid (as a 

tragic butterfly)

While Gigi Hadid, arguably 

the it-girl of the moment, is pret-
ty much perfect in every way ... 
but at VS, not so much. This trag-
edy that made its way down the 
runway was just a huge let-down. 
This being the first year she was 
accepted into the high-profile 
fashion show, I was expecting big 
things from her runway looks, 
but was met with utter disap-
pointment. In a half-assed but-
terfly ensemble that reminded 
me more of a sad green plant, the 
makers of the show did not let 
Hadid shine like she could have. 
— Mariam Sheikh

BEST: Cindy Burna
Flawless, dripping in gold and 

looking completely immaculate, 
Burna stunned in each and every 
look she wore this year. My per-
sonal favorite? While it may not 
have highlighted the classic VS 
bra, the sheer nude bodysuit 
dripping with rainbow embel-
lishments stole the show. What 
was most amazing was how the 
body-form jumpsuit even morphed 
over her sky-high heels, making 
her look effervescent from head to 
toe. Donning feathers in an uncon-
ventional way in many shapes and 
colors, of course to resemble angel 
wings, Burna managed to look 
angelic and was perhaps the best 
angel on the runway. — Mariam 
Sheikh

There are many ways to tackle 

Ugly Sweater Season. After three 
years’ worth of Christmas Par-
ties hosted at my parents’ house, I 
consider myself well-seasoned in 
the new millennium’s trend that 
often ends in a once-worn sweat-
er covered in a variety of festive 
drinks and food.

The first (and most obvious) 

factor in festivities is the sweater 
itself, and it would be naive to 
assume all sweaters are created 
equally. There’s the classic, gen-
uinely ugly sweater — it’s more 
than likely very bright, its materi-
al all but filled with embroidering 
and it (naturally) itches like hell. 
The Sweater Store will be one of 

the first links discovered for those 
on the hunt for the sweater that 
will perfectly represent “you” 
this winter. While its collection 
appears extremely ugly, yet some-
what endearing, the true ugliness 
rests in vintage stores and poorly 
designed e-stores further down.

The second type of “ugly” 

sweater is just the opposite — 
cute. Often, while still brightly 
colored and overwhelming in 
design, the cuter sweaters seen 
under the mistletoe stem from 
more mainstream roots — Urban 
Outfitters, Forever 21, Amazon 
to name a few. Cuteness aside, 
mass-produced “ugly” sweaters 
are problematic on their own — if 
cute is what you aim for and you 
would like to stay in the tongue-
in-cheek spirit, then Ebay, with 

its seemingly endless pages of 
vintage sweaters, is just the place 
to find the perfect paradoxical 
cute ugly sweater for you.

Funny sweaters are, truly, the 

end-all-be-all of holiday par-
ties. You can buy them from the 
pros at Tipsy Elves or the mas-
terminds of Etsy, where I pur-
chased a white crew neck with a 
screenprinted Miley Cyrus’s face 
(tongue and all), complete with 
tinsel and blinking lights (10/10 
would recommend). But ulti-
mately, the largest feat of Sweater 
SZN is the ideation and imple-
mentation of bomb sweater ideas. 
(Pinterest is always fair game.) 
Screwing Reindeers and pissing 
Santa Clauses are hilarious and 
always welcome, but more than 
often it’s the three-dimensional 

Ugly sweater season 
prompts style choices

DIY sweaters that will always be 
remembered best. For example, 
my mom (whose name happens 
to be Joy) made a simple sweat-
er with two gloves glued to the 
chest above the phrase “Feel The 
Joy” last year, winning the best 
female sweater.

Other clothing is simply there 

to support the aura created by 
your sweater. Sweaters nearly 
across the board can be paired 
with dealer’s choice of jeans or 
leggings (or no pants at all, if your 
sweater is longer). Reindeer ant-
lers, santa hats, festive socks and 
shoes are all extra credit. There’s 
no shame in building a flatter-
ing, cohesive outfit around your 
sweater. And similarly, there’s no 
shame in dressing to the north 
pole and back in holiday-themed 
accessories — someone’s got to do 
it, right?

Ultimately, it doesn’t matter 

what style sweater-outfit suits 
you. Look online, craft away, 
borrow from friends, but no 
matter what your choices are, 
just wear a damn sweater. If you 
don’t, it’s been confirmed — we 
are more fun than you.

Songs of 2015 you 
should be listening to

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

2015 was a big deal for music 

and me. I went to my first music 
festival, expanded my musical 
tastes tenfold and finally listened 
to the entirety of Channel Orange 
(I was embarrassingly late to 
that party). More important than 
my own musical year, though, 
there was simply a ridiculous 
amount of good music released, 
with hopefully more to come 
(@BadGalRiri, 
@FrankOcean 

& @KanyeWest). Nonetheless, 
between Adele, Justin Bieber, 
The Weeknd, Kendrick Lamar 
and many other major releases, 
some time-worthy tracks got 
lost in the shuffle.

“Lady” - Noé

I first heard Noé’s strong-

willed 
pleasure 
anthem 
on 

Not Mad as part of a Q&A with 
the Berkeley School of Music. 
Extremely polished for an artist 
as unestablished as Noé, the 
song should be raking in Spotify 
listens and climbing iTunes 
charts.

“Kamikaze” - MØ

Danish singer MØ is best 

known for her feature on Major 
Lazer’s “Lean On,” which was 
this year’s number one streamed 
song 
on 
Spotify. 
Currently 

awaiting the release of her 
second LP, MØ graced fans with 
its lead single, “Kamikaze.” 
Produced by Diplo, “Kamikaze” 
follows the same formula of 
post-chorus instrumentals and 
MØ’s singular voice is unlike 
any other in popular music’s 
landscape. That, coupled with 

expert 
production 
and 
the 

(literally) unforgettable lyrics 
gives the track more and more 
intrigue with each listen.

“Let It Happen” - Tame 

Impala

“Let It Happen” opens the 

Australian 
psychedelic 
rock 

band Tame Impala’s third album 
Currents. 
Written, 
recorded, 

performed and produced by 
Kevin Parker, “Let It Happen” 
is, in my opinion, the best song 
on one of 2015’s best albums. 
“Let It Happen” is a tour de 
force of one man’s musical 
landscape. 
The 
intricacy 

present in the multitude of 
instruments manages to keep 
listeners interested, especially 
at each sonic transformation 
throughout its almost 8-minute 
runtime.

“Yoga” - Janelle Monae

“Yoga,” in short, was the 

summer banger of 2015 (for me 
and a few others). Immediately 
from Jidenna’s deep “Let your 
booty do that yoga,” followed by 
a bass drop and Monae’s debut 
“Party at the beach down in 
Copacabana,” the song comes 
to life in its first verse and 
carries its energy through the 
remaining 3 minutes.

“In Time” - FKA Twigs

Off her third EP M3LL155X 

(her best work yet), “In Time” 
might be her most mainstream 
track to date. Twigs employs 
all her tricks — brilliant lyrics, 
beats that take on a life of their 
own without overpowering the 
vocals, voice distortion (in just 
the right amount) and finally 
her raw, emotional delivery 

brings her music to another 
level.

“Levels” - Nick Jonas

Despite Nick Jonas being 

fucking everywhere this year, 
the single from his self-titled 
release didn’t receive nearly 
as much love as it deserved. 
Arguably better than “Jealous” 
or “Chains,” “Levels” gains 
all of its hook through Jonas’s 
on-point delivery. His high-notes 
maintain traces of raspiness and 
the often subtle trail-off of those 
notes make the song extremely 
fun to sing along to. (@ Tailgate 
DJs of The University, play this 
next year, please.)

“Instigators” 
- 
Grace 

Potter

“Instigators,” 
off 
Grace 

Potter’s 
debut 
solo 
album 

Midnight, is one of the LP’s 
many highlights. Immediately 
from the electro-pop synths 
and contrasting guitar riffs, 
Potter’s newly found sound is 
The Nocturnals without the 
“alternative” qualifier allowing 
her vocals and personality to 
fulfill a void in pop music’s 
current 
offerings. 
Unafraid 

to 
commit, 
the 
vocals 
on 

“Instigators” flirt with the line 
between singing and screaming, 
but in the end Potter’s ability to 
deliver high-notes with power 
and control.

“Who I Want You To Love” 

- Bleachers & Natalie Maines

Originally 
on 
Bleachers’s 

Strange 
Desire, 
the 
album-

closer makes a reprise in 2015 
featured on the release Terrible 
Thrills Vol. 2 with guest vocals 
by Dixie Chicks member Natalie 
Maines. Maines’s breadth of 
talent ranges from her southern 
humor on commonly known 
throwback “Goodbye Earl” to 
her rock chops on solo track 
“Trained.” Her vocals combined 
with Jack Antonoff’s lyricism 
on “Who I Want You To Love” 
is revolutionary. Without the 
eccentricity 
on 
Antonoff’s 

delivery on the original, the 
song takes on a new aura in 
Maines’s seasoned hands.

CAROLINE 

FILIPS

Despite my various off-putting 

qualities — forgetfulness, a trash 
attention span and the tragic 
inheritance of the weird gene that 
makes me think cilantro tastes 
like 
dish 

soap — I give 
great advice. 
Despite 
my 

title as a style 
columnist, 
I’m incapable 
of 
giving 

style advice, 
at least the 
kind 
most 

people crave.

When 

friends and family consult me for 
the general principles of style, 
I have nothing to say. Sure, I’d 
love to outline the rules, but to 
me, there aren’t any. Fashion first 
and foremost is an extension of 
self-expression; so who am I to 
tell you how to present yourself 
to the world? That’s not to say 
I encourage you to rock your 
tattered jean jacket at a black 
tie event (looking at you, Adam 
DePollo), but I do support you 
in your search of cultivating an 
individual sense of style.

I’ll let you in on a little secret, 

dear readers. Trends are not, in 
any way, shape, or form, a part of 
the elusive concept of personal 
style. And I get it, it’s hard not 
to buy into the trend-centric 
culture of our world where three 
out of every five headlines are 
dominated by which fashion 
label the Kardashian family is 
currently lusting over, but please, 
by all means, resist.

Though I concede that I’m 

quite young and probably more 
naïve than I’d like to think I am, 
I too, albeit guiltily, indulge in the 
latest celebrity style endorsements 
and collaborations just as much as 
the next internet-poisoned youth. 
Even as I write this, I glance down 
at my Olivia Palermo for BaubleBar 
ring and scoff at my past self for 
attempting to justify the purchase. 
I convinced myself that the small 
piece of jewelry aligned with my 
personal style … but as I scan the 
various fits and washes of denim 
strewn about my floor, and the 
blouses 
haphazardly 
cluttering 

my closet, I can’t even commit to 
a stark definition of my personal 
style. So alas, here I am, in my 
quarter-life personal style crisis.

Frankly, I believe it to be a 

generational crisis. We’ve given 
up on the notion of personal style. 
We’re lazy. We just follow the 
celebrity, the trend, the tragedy! 
We salivate over fast fashion 
collaborations 
(*cough, 
cough* 

Balmain for H&M), we buy out 
Kylie’s entire stock of lip kits in 
30 seconds and some of us even 
contribute to the skyrocketing 
sales of Drake’s Moncler Maya coat 
from the “Hotline Bling” music 
video. It’s likely that just as I added 
an Olivia Palermo-designed ring 
to my shopping cart a month ago, 
someone somewhere was probably 
gyrating in their candy apple red 
puffer under technicolor lights.

So Kylie, Drake and this shiny 

gold circle around my ring finger 
leave me perplexed. At the risk of 
sounding like Carrie Bradshaw, “I 
(can’t) help but wonder,” has our 

generation discarded the concept 
of personal style?

Though it nauseates me, the 

horrific trend cycle — wear it, 
abuse it, forget about it for a few 
decades, refresh it, return to it 
— of fashion invariably reigns. 
Take bell-bottoms, for example. 
They 
dominated 
the 
’70s, 

resurfaced in the early 2000s in 
a less-voluminous boot-cut style, 
returned in 2014 in the flared 
varieties and everyone forgot about 
them in between. Trends dominate 
the times, but I can’t understand 
why we sit back, let it happen and 
buy into them. We’re the Gatsbys of 
our own sartorial stories.

Why 
are 
we 
hopelessly 

infatuated with things that only 
turn up when they demand our 
attention? 
 
@Everyone, 
stop 

playing Gatsby and stop letting 
the dominant fads play Daisy! 
At the very least give your selves 
some character weight — be Nick 
— be a mere observer of the trendy 
chaos. At the very least be a Jordan 
Baker — respect yourself despite 
the missteps and, above all, have 
character. 

I’m not saying life’s always 

going to be a party on West Egg 
at some rich dude’s house, but 
each day is a chance to ignore the 
not-so-trendy trendiness and find 
your personal style. And despite 
my title as a style columnist, 
I don’t believe in style advice. 
That’s my advice. the not-so-
trendy trendiness and find your 
personal style. And despite my 
title as a style columnist, I don’t 
believe in style advice. That’s my 
advice. 

STYLE COLUMN

Being your own 

style icon

By MATT GALLATIN

Daily Arts Writer

What is a genre? A collection of 

similar sounding music? A name 
for a specific artistic movement? 
The 
exact 

definition can 
be tricky, and 
often the term 
boxes artists 
and confuses 
listeners. The 
“Pop” 
genre 

on 
iTunes, 

for example, 
encompasses 
Frank Ocean, 
Fall Out Boy 
and John Lennon, all of whom 
have a markedly different sound.

Because 
of 
the 
strange 

confinements the concept of 
genres lead to, the phrase “genre 

blurring” has gained a largely 
positive connotation. It’s seen 
as a validation of an artist’s skill 
if they can be effective beyond 
the 
formula 
they’re 
usually 

known for. Radiohead did this 
to a hugely successful effect, 
shifting from guitar driven rock 
to experimental electronic to 
their dark and seductive release 
In 
Rainbows. 
Each 
change 

highlighted a diverse skillset and 
rebelled against the idea of what 
typical “rock” should be.

Sometimes the result is much 

less successful. Kid Cudi is a prime 
example of this. His debut release 
Man on the Moon: The End of Day 
blended R&B, hip hop and rock to 
a moderately interesting effect. 
It was far from perfect, but there 
was enough catchy production to 
counteract Cudi’s lack of lyrical 
prowess. 
He 
skyrocketed 
to 

popularly on the sheer listenability 
of his music and the hordes of 
faux-philosophical “nice guys” 
who hailed him as their leader, 
relating to his irksome “nice guy” 
complaints (“maybe if I was a jerk 
to girls, instead of being nice and 
speaking kind words”). His most 
popular tracks, like “Soundtrack 
2 My Life” and “Day n’ Night,” are 
simply enjoyable songs, no more 
and no less. This would explain 
why Cudi found his greatest 
success in the high school party 
scene, 
becoming 
practically 

synonymous with it after the 
teen film “Project X” propelled 
“Pursuit of Happiness” to anthem 
status.

But the constant mix of 

self-aggrandizing, 
screams 
of 

“I’m different!” and adolescent 
confessionals could only go so far. 
After his second album Man on the 
Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager, 
which was mostly an extension 
on the first, Cudi began to move 
in different directions. He tried 
his hand at an alternative rock/
psychedelic band called WZRD 
with producer Dot da Genius, but 
the debut was met with largely 
negative reviews. His next solo 
album Indicud saw Cudi return 
to the hip-hop world, and the 
new production was unique 
but forgettable. The album was 
panned because it proved that 
Cudi truly had nothing left to say 
after the Man on the Moon series 
— he actually got worse. Take his 
lyrics from “Just What I Am”: 
“Let me tell you ‘bout my month 
y’all, endless shopping, I had a 
ball, I had to ball for therapy, 
my shrink don’t think that helps 
at all, whatever, that man ain’t 
wearing these leather pants.” It’s 
the ultimate sad brag, alternating 
between “I’m so sensitive” and 
“I’m so cool and wealthy.”

Still, Cudi’s last album Satellite 

Flight: The Journey to Mother 
Moon showed more promise. It’s 
his shortest album to date and 
was billed as a bridge between 
Indicud and a possible Man on 
the Moon III. The album had 
some of the most interesting 
production since his debut, and it 
seemed that there was something 
different coming.

So what, you ask, happened 

after leaving us on that cautiously 
hopeful note? Cudi’s worst release 
to date: Speedin’ Bullet 2 Heaven. 
If we are to believe Cudi’s claim 
that this is “100% the purest form 
of my artistic self,” then Cudi’s 
true artistic self is a mediocre 
Nirvana revivalist band.

Cudi has always cited ’90s 

punk rock as having a strong 
influence on his music. But 
where Cudi once claimed some 

originality by stepping around 
typical genre boxes and adding 
his own personality, Speedin’ 
Bullet 
2 
Heaven 
removes 

everything that once made Cudi 
unique and popular – ease of 
listening, productive strength, 
etc. – and replaces it with his best 
attempt at replicating the ’90s 
grunge movement.

And it’s a poor attempt at 

that. Cudi plays bass and guitar 
throughout the album, and while 
the effort is commendable, the 
instrumentation is clearly weak. 
This is only exacerbated by Cudi’s 
insistence on refraining from 
the usual electronic production, 
trying to remain as true to 
Nirvana as possible. References to 
the band, and Cobain specifically, 
are plentiful. Cudi moans and 
yells, the guitar is distorted 
and the lyricism is dark. These 
are all superficial aspects. The 
artistry 
which 
set 
Nirvana 

apart 
— 
beautifully 
cryptic 

poetry, perfected instrument 
arrangements 
and 
a 
strong 

pop sensibility — is blatantly 
disrespected. 
Where 
Cobain 

used phrases like “heart-shaped 
box” or “meat-eating orchid,” 
Cudi blurts out “her vagina is 
moist and warm.” Cobain is 
rolling in his grave.

Clocking in at over an hour-

and-a-half, Speedin’ Bullet 2 
Heaven is a chore to get through. 
There are few songs which 
warrant more than a single 
listen, and the ones that do (the 
title track) are still far below 
Cudi’s 
previous 
successes. 

The claim of a “double album” 
doesn’t produce any kind of 
measurable effect, and it seems 
like a half-hearted justification 
for sprawling over 26 tracks 
without any substantive reason 
to do so.

But most confusing are the 

Beavis 
and 
Butthead 
skits. 

Narration has been a recurrent 
element in Cudi’s music, and 
it’s nearly always ineffectual. 
He uses it to repeat points that 
need no repetition and to offer 
as much self-praise as possible. 
The Beavis and Butthead skits 
are especially strange because 
their irreverent and self-aware 
comedy directly conflicts with 
the 
self-riotousness 
Cudi 

stands for. At times it seems as 
if they’re mocking him without 
his realization. At the end of 
“Man in the Night” Butthead 
states “Hello ladies, we bring 
you the greatest album that has 
ever been made in the history 
of man.” For a second Beavis 
can be heard laughing in the 
background.

It’s hard to believe the irony 

was 
purposeful, 
especially 

when referring to Cudi’s Twitter 
account — “The Chosen One.” 
The last few months have filled 
his feed with discussion on the 
album, and none of it has been 
humble or modest. Between 
tweets like “the complexity of 
scott mescudi” and “Im (sic) 
strange” Cudi quotes statements 
by his fans hailing the work 
as 
“genius” 
or 
“completely 

revolutionary.” Sure, plenty of 
artists call themselves the best. 
Some even compare themselves 
to god (Kanye). But many of those 
artists have the skill to at least 
make an argument, something 
that has been lacking from 
Cudi’s work.

We can only hope that Cudi 

once again changes direction. 
Perhaps he still has some talent 
left.

Wolverines seek revenge vs. 
weakened Minnesota team

By JUSTIN MEYER

Daily Sports Writer

When two of college hockey’s 

most storied programs meet, 
there’s always a little extra buzz 
around 
the 

rink. But when 
Minnesota and 
No. 9 Michigan 
drop 
the 

puck at Yost 
Ice Arena on 
Friday 
night, 

it 
won’t 
be 

just a matchup 
of star talent 
and Big Ten 
contenders. 
It’s personal.

“We 
know 

Minnesota 
knocked us out 
of the Big Ten 
championship 
last year,” said 
senior forward Justin Selman. 
“They took away our chance to 
go the (NCAA) Tournament. 
There’s 
a 
little 
vengeance 

there.”

A lot has been said about 

the 
Wolverines’ 
tournament 

drought in the past three years, 
but now, Michigan (1-0-1 Big 
Ten, 8-2-3 overall) sees another 
chance to end that conversation.

The opportunity is even more 

important because the Gophers 
aren’t the same as they were last 
season.

Frankly, Minnesota looks to 

be a mediocre hockey team — 
maybe middle of the pack in the 
Big Ten, but not a NCAA title 
contender. The Gophers have no 
marquee wins on the season — a 
victory over No. 18 Notre Dame 
comes closest.

With all of the talent the 

program attracts, the situation 

is certainly a rarity, but one 
ripe for the taking by Michigan. 
The Big Ten is wide open this 
season, and it’s the best chance 
for the Wolverines to take the 
league title outright since the 
conference adopted hockey four 
seasons ago.

The Gophers took care of 

business in their opening series 
against Ohio State last weekend 
with two wins. Michigan, on 
the other hand, got a win in its 
first game against Wisconsin 
but needed a shootout to beat 
the Badgers last Saturday.

“Last weekend, I think a lot 

of guys got a good feel for what 
Big Ten hockey is like,” said 
sophomore 
defender 
Cutler 

Martin. “Wisconsin is picked 
to be last in 
the Big Ten, 
and we had 
a 
shootout 

win and a 6-4 
victory.”

That 
left 

Minnesota 
(2-0, 
6-7) 

sitting 
atop 

the division with Penn State, 
while the Wolverines were 
relegated to second place. It’s 
a difference of only one point, 
but Michigan needs to take 
every inch it can against an 
underwhelming conference.

“We 
really 
feel 
like 

Minnesota is a team we need to 
buckle down on,” Martin said. 
“The coaches don’t necessarily 
have to say it, but every player 
knows that this is a big week for 
us.”

The series will be a matchup 

of two very different playing 
styles. The Wolverines’ run-
and-gun offense will match 
up against a team that ranks 
near the bottom of the Big Ten 

in goals per game (2.77) and 
dead last in shots per game, 
averaging seven fewer than 
Michigan.

The Gophers are making up 

for the lack of shot production, 
at least in part, by shooting 
efficiently. Their mark of .095 
goals per shot is near the top 
third of teams nationally and 
second in the Big Ten.

Swedish 
import 
Leon 

Bristedt is also making nice 
contributions on offense. The 
sophomore 
forward 
has 
14 

points despite posting just 19 all 
of last season.

If Minnesota takes advantage 

this weekend, though, it will 
start on the defensive end. Eric 
Schierhorn has been strong 

in 
net 
for 

Minnesota, 
playing nearly 
every minute 
and 
keeping 

a respectable 
.915 
save 

percentage 
in 
spite 
of 

the 
troubled 

season.

Michigan has struggled to 

bring energy in a few home 
games this year, but Selman 
doesn’t figure that will be an 
issue Friday.

“If you can’t find a heartbeat 

in that game,” he said, “you’ve 
got to check your pulse.”

Instead, the challenge for the 

Wolverines will be to reign in 
opponent scoring. A lot of blame 
has fallen on the goaltenders 
so far this season, but the 
entire team will have to be held 
accountable on the defensive 
end.

Redemption chances don’t 

come around too often, and 
Michigan wants this one badly.

‘M’ needs bounceback

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball 
team 
is 
focused 

on the bounceback. After a 
lackluster performance in a loss 
to Princeton on Sunday, the 
Wolverines’ hot start in their 
first seven games doesn’t look as 
impressive anymore.

But this Sunday, Michigan 

(7-1) 
will 

have 
another 

opportunity to 
put itself back 
in the top-25 
conversation 
with 
a 
win 

against 
No. 

20 UCLA. In 
a 
crowded 

Big 
Ten 

conference, the 
Wolverines are 
determined to 
prove 
they’re 

contenders. 
It’s 
their 
third 

consecutive 
shot 
to 
reclaim 

victory against an opponent they 
lost to last season, but this test is 
even tougher than the rest.

“(Since the Princeton game) 

people 
say, 
‘Now 
Michigan 

played a real team and they’re 
not as good as they thought or 
as we thought,’ ” said sophomore 
guard Katelynn Flaherty. “We 
still think we’re great, we still 
believe in ourselves. So I think 
now, going forward, we have 
something to prove to teams.”

A statement win against the 

Bruins will surely turn heads 
and catch opponents’ attention. 
UCLA is 4-2, but its losses have 
come against premiere opponents 
in No. 2 South Carolina and No. 3 
Notre Dame — both Final Four 
teams last season. The Bruins lost 
to the Gamecocks by just three 
and took the Irish to overtime 
before falling by four.

UCLA is led by Jordin Canada, 

a shifty point guard who averages 
19.2 points a contest. Michigan 

coach Kim Barnes Arico called 
her one of the most dynamic 
and athletic point guards in the 
country. Along with skilled inside 
players who use their length and 
athleticism to rebound efficiently, 
the Bruins can also light it up from 
behind the arc. Kari Korver, the 
cousin of NBA sharpshooter Kyle 
Korver, shoots the 3-pointer well, 
and hurt the Wolverines in the 
2015 WNIT Semifinal last season.

In the waning seconds of the 

semifinal, Michigan was down 
by two with UCLA at the free-
throw line. The Bruins missed 
their first free throw, and they 
grabbed the offensive rebound, 
drew a foul and knocked down 
two free throws to make it a two-
possession lead. The Wolverines 
couldn’t recover from there.

While assistant coach Megan 

Duffy has spent time looking 
at the film from last season’s 
down-to-the-wire game, which 
Michigan lost by four, Barnes 
Arico is analyzing film from 
this season. The Wolverines 
are a completely different team 
compared to the last time they 
played UCLA.

The Bruins are returning 

most of their team from last 
year, whereas Michigan’s young 
squad was exposed in its last 

performance and will be tested 
against an older team once 
again. The Wolverines may have 
actually have benefited from 
losing to Princeton, and Flaherty 
described the loss as a wake-up 
call. According to her, it showed 
the team what it needs to work 
on in order to beat higher-caliber 
teams.

Michigan is working on its 

transition game as well as taking 
care of the ball, two facets of the 
game it struggled with against 
the Tigers. At the beginning of 
the season, those two attributes 
were variables the team was very 
confident in excelling at.

The Wolverines’ first loss of 

the season has lit a fire in them, 
but they’ll need everyone at 
their best in order to win. They 
can’t just rely on a 33-point 
performance from Flaherty like 
they did in their last contest. A 
victory this Sunday would be 
much more than a bounceback. 
A win would prove that they are 
truly competitive.

“Our 
team 
is 
really 

disappointed, they’re bummed 
out,” Barnes Arico said. “But 
they know UCLA is one of the top 
teams in the country, so they’re 
excited to challenge themselves 
against the best.”

Michigan starts Big Ten play strong

By ORION SANG 

Daily Sports Writer

When the season began, 

the No. 10 Michigan wrestling 
team hoped it would be in the 
national title picture by this 
point in the year.

But after a loss to then-No. 

14 Oklahoma and a seventh-
place finish at the Cliff Keen 
Las 
Vegas 

Invitational, 
the 
Wolverines were looking to 
get back into the win column 
Thursday 
night 
against 

Michigan State.

The Wolverines (1-0 Big Ten, 

4-1 overall) won the match 
handily, winning at eight out 
of the 10 lineup spots for a 39-6 
victory at Cliff Keen Arena.

Michigan 
coach 
Joe 

McFarland was pleased with 
his team’s performance, but he 
was also focused on his team’s 
learning process.

“We always want to try to do 

better, but tonight was pretty 
good,” McFarland said. “I like 
how the guys are thinking right 
now. All these experiences are 
going to help us down the road.”

The 
Wolverines 
found 

themselves 
down 
6-5 
after 

the first three rounds, with 
redshirt junior Conor Youtsey 
and redshirt sophomore George 
Fisher 
both 
dropping 
long, 

hard-fought matches.

Though Youtsey and Fisher 

weren’t 
able 
to 
win 
their 

matches, McFarland thought 
the two losses had the potential 
to help the team.

“It’s not just about going out 

and getting your hand raised,” 
McFarland 
said. 
“It’s 

about going out 
and extending 
yourself, 
learning 
how 

to execute and 
score 
points 

when 
you’re 

exhausted, 
because that’s 
where 
those 

championship 
matches are won.”

For a motivated Michigan 

team, the deficit didn’t last 
long.

In the next round, sophomore 

Alec Pantaleo continued to 
build upon his hot start to the 
season, winning his match by 

technical 
fall, 
19-4, 

with multiple 
takedowns.

Pantaleo’s 

victory 
gave 

Michigan 
a 

lead it did not 
relinquish.

Murphy, 

in his return 
from 
an 

injury, 
won 

his match quickly, 14-2, with 
two 
near-falls 
and 
three 

takedowns.

“To be honest with you, we 

weren’t sure if he was going to 
wrestle tonight,” McFarland said. 
“We were going to leave it up to 
him. He still had some soreness 
in his hip earlier this week, but he 
said he felt ready to go.”

In the next round, Michigan’s 

victory 
became 
all 
but 

guaranteed when sophomore 
Garrett 
Sutton’s 
opponent 

defaulted due to injury, giving 
the Wolverines a 20-6 lead.

Two rounds later, junior 

Domenic Abounader registered 
the only pin of the match, 
before both Coon and fifth-year 
senior Max Huntley won by 
technical falls to end the match 
for the Wolverines’ first win in 

conference play.

As Michigan begins a stretch 

of conference matches, Coon 
offered his thoughts on his 
team’s performance up to this 
point.

“The team’s doing all right,” 

Coon 
said. 
“We’re 
not 
as 

competitive as we thought we 
would be. We thought we would 
be 
national 
championship 

contenders at this point. Now 
that 
this 
first 
semester 
is 

behind us, we’ve got to keep 
grinding and be that national 
championship team.”

Added McFarland: “We’ve 

gotta continue to work on our 
toughness and our grit, and you 
do that in these matches like we 
did tonight.”

Murphy, Coon 
provide boost

By LELAND MITCHINSON 

Daily Sports Writer

After going without juniors 

Brian Murphy and Adam Coon 
at last weekend’s Cliff Keen 
Las Vegas Invitational, the 
Michigan wrestling team got 
a boost from having the two 
veterans back in the lineup 
for the Big Ten season opener 
Thursday 
against 
Michigan 

State.

Murphy, 

who 
was 

previously 
held 
out 

due 
to 
a 

minor injury 
concern, 
wrestled 
in the 157-
pound 
weight class, 
taking 
on 

Michigan 
State’s Joe Johnson. At the 
start of the night, Michigan 
coach 
Joe 
McFarland 
was 

unsure if Murphy would even 
compete.

“We knew we were going to 

weigh him in, and we had two 
guys weigh in at that weight 
class,” McFarland said. “We 
were going to leave it up to him, 
and he still had some soreness 
in his hip earlier this week, but 
he said he felt ready to go. He’s a 
pretty tough kid, so he made the 
call, and of course he had the 
green light from our medical 
staff. So we sent him out there, 
and he did a great job and got a 
major win for us.”

Ranked No. 5 nationally in 

his weight class, Murphy came 
out strong against Johnson, 
scoring four points in the first 
period and a near-fall in the 
third, while conceding just two 
escapes on his way to a 14-2 
match win.

“I wanted to see where I’m 

at before I can start really 
training again,” Murphy said. 
“We have a long break. It’s like 

a test to see where I’m at and 
things I can work on, because 
live competitions are a lot 
different.”

Prior to the match against 

the Spartans, Coon, the No. 3 
heavyweight in the country, 
had been given time off to work 
on his Greco-Roman wrestling 
for the US Open — an Olympic 
qualifying event — but he 
did not miss a beat stepping 
back into folkstyle to take 

on 
Michigan 

State’s 
Dimitrus 
Renfroe.

“I 
would 

say it’s a better 
transition 
at 

heavyweight 
than it is in any 
other weight,” 
Coon 
said. 

“There is a lot 
more 
upper 

body wrestling at heavyweight. 
Just traditionally, a lot more 
hand fighting, but it is pretty 
much two different sports. 
There are a lot of different 
techniques and a lot of things 
that will work in Greco that 
won’t work in folkstyle and vice 
versa.”

Coon dominated his match, 

allowing only one point on 
an escape by Renfroe, while 
scoring a near-fall and four 
takedowns, including one at the 
end of the match to conclude the 
bout as a technical fall.

The 17-1 win by Coon capped a 

39-6 victory for the Wolverines 
in their last match before their 
winter break.

“It gives your team that 

confidence when you get two 
guys like Brian and Adam back 
in your lineup,” McFarland 
said. “It makes us that much 
stronger. We were excited to 
get Brian going again, and he 
looked like he pushed pretty 
hard. Both those guys pushed 
the pace pretty hard in those 
matches.”

2015 Season Review: Wide 
Receivers and Tight Ends 

Three main pass 

catchers starred for 

Wolverines

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

Editor’s 
Note: 
With 
the 

Michigan football team’s 2015 
regular season in the books, 
the Daily looks back at the 
performance of each unit this 
year and looks ahead to the 
future in 2016. In this edition: 
wide receivers and tight ends.

When 
Devin 
Funchess 

forewent his senior season and 
declared for the NFL Draft last 
spring, he left a gaping hole in 
the Michigan football team’s 
receiving 
corps. 
Funchess 

caught 62 passes for 733 yards 
and four touchdowns in 2014. 
The Wolverines’ top returning 
receiver, redshirt junior Amara 
Darboh, caught 36 passes for 
473 yards and two touchdowns.

Going into 2015, Michigan 

had talent, albeit unproven 
talent. 
The 
wide 
receivers 

faced a tough task this summer 
forming chemistry with fifth-
year senior quarterback Jake 
Rudock, a graduate transfer 
from Iowa. Rudock and the 
receivers shared criticism in 
the early part of the season for 
struggling to connect on long 
passes downfield. But both 
improved as the season went 
on, and three consistent pass-
catching threats emerged by the 
end of the year.

Darboh led the team in 

receptions 
and 
yards, 
and 

Chesson was first with eight 
receiving 
touchdowns. 
Each 

had breakout games, and each 
made highlight-reel plays. Like 
Rudock, they were average 
in the beginning but slowly 

improved, thanks in part to 
passing game coordinator Jedd 
Fisch, who came over from the 
NFL’s Jacksonville Jaguars in 
the offseason.

Perhaps a bigger storyline 

was Michigan’s emphasis on 
tight ends this season under 
first-year coach Jim Harbaugh. 
Harbaugh made the position 
a staple of his offense at 
Stanford and with the NFL’s 
San Francisco 49ers, and even 
without time to mold the roster 
to his liking, he made tight ends 
useful in his first season.

Junior tight end Jake Butt 

became the third receiving 
threat. He had one of his best 
games in the season opener 
at Utah, catching eight passes 
for 93 yards and a touchdown. 
He then tailed off before later 
becoming Rudock’s safety valve 
down the stretch.

The Wolverines’ weakness 

at wide receiver, though, was 
depth. The third-best wideout 
by 
yardage 
was 
freshman 

Grant Perry with 77. Outside 
the three top receivers, only 
junior running back De’Veon 
Smith and senior tight end A.J. 
Williams surpassed 100 yards 
on the season, though Michigan 
did have 19 players in total catch 
a pass.

HIGH 
POINT: 
Of 
the 

receivers’ 
five 
100-yard 

performances, two came at 
Indiana on Nov. 14. While the 
Hoosiers racked up points with 
their no-huddle spread offense, 
the Wolverines matched them 
with a newfound, high-powered 
passing attack. Chesson caught 
10 passes for 207 yards and four 
touchdowns — the latter tying 
a school record. Darboh added 
eight receptions for 109 yards 
and the game-winning 25-yard 
score in the second overtime.

The unit also started off the 

season strong at Utah, where 
Darboh and Butt each pulled in 
eight receptions.

LOW POINT: The unit never 

truly struggled, but the second 
and third games of the season 
against Oregon State and UNLV 
provided a lull. In both wins, 
Chesson, 
Darboh 
and 
Butt 

combined for fewer than 100 
yards — 89 against the Beavers 
and 60 against the Rebels — and 
did not find the end zone while 
the rushing attack carried the 
offense.

The trio rebounded with 

a combined 115 yards and a 
touchdown 
against 
Brigham 

Young the following week and 
later scored 13 times in the last 
five games of the season.

THE FUTURE: If Michigan 

can avoid attrition at receiver, 
the Wolverines should be in 
great shape for next season. 
Almost all of their contributors 
have eligibility remaining.

Butt announced this week 

that he will return for his 
senior season, and Chesson and 
Darboh, both redshirt juniors, 
should be back for fifth years, 
though Chesson may decide to 
test the NFL waters.

After 
that, 
there’s 
room 

for 
development. 
Redshirt 

freshman 
Ian 
Bunting 
and 

redshirt 
sophomores 
Henry 

Poggi and Khalid Hill will each 
have another year of experience 
under their belts at tight end. 
Williams is the only notable 
departure.

Perry and redshirt freshman 

Maurice Ways can also continue 
to grow, and four-star recruits 
Brad 
Hawkins 
and 
Ahmir 

Mitchell will be on campus as 
well. Harbaugh didn’t make 
wide receivers a focal point 
this season, but he will have 
the opportunity to do so if the 
development continues.

FOOTBALL
2015 Season Review: RBs 

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

Editor’s 
Note: 
With 
the 

Michigan football team’s 2015 
regular season in the books, 
the Daily looks back at the 
performance of each unit this 
year and looks ahead to the future 
in 2016. In this edition: running 
backs.

Heading 
into 
the 
season, 

Michigan returned a trio of 
experienced running backs in 
redshirt junior Drake Johnson 
and 
juniors 
De’Veon 
Smith 

and Derrick Green. With the 
addition of redshirt sophomore 
Ty Isaac, the group was expected 
to progress and perhaps be a 
strong point of the Wolverines’ 
offense with question marks at 
quarterback and wide receiver.

After an underwhelming start 

to the season against Utah, the 
running backs came into their 
own during the next stretch of 
the season. Michigan surpassed 
200 rushing yards in four of its 
next five games, failing to reach 
the mark only against Maryland, 
when the Wolverines ran for 198 
yards.

Smith put together two games 

of at least 125 yards in that 
stretch, and Isaac rushed for 
115 in another. However, things 
were never quite the same after 
Michigan rushed for 201 yards in 
a 38-0 win against Northwestern.

Isaac and Green appeared to 

fall out of favor as the season 
progressed. Green received just 
five carries in the second half of 
the season, while Isaac received 
none after the seventh game.

Smith and Johnson picked 

up some of the slack, but neither 
surpassed 
75 
yards 
on 
the 

ground in a single game during 
the second half of the season. 
Redshirt freshman safety Jabrill 
Peppers found some success 
running the ball late in the year 
and served as a decoy out of the 
backfield on other occasions. 

HIGH POINT: Michigan’s 

five-game stretch from Sept. 

12 against Oregon State to Oct. 
10 against Northwestern was 
unmatched this season in terms 
of production in the running 
game.

The Wolverines rushed for 

1,132 yards in those games on 224 
carries, good for an average of 
5.05 yards per carry. Michigan, 
excluding a shootout against 
Indiana in which it averaged five 
yards per carry, never averaged 
more than 3.7 yards per carry in 
the second half of the season.

LOW 
POINT: 
The 

Wolverines’ 
running 
game 

struggled 
immensely 
against 

some of its toughest Big Ten 
opponents: Michigan State, Penn 
State and Ohio State. Michigan 
failed to surpass 100 rushing 
yards in any of those contests. 
Against the Buckeyes, it ran for 
a season-low 57 yards on the 
ground.

Making matters worse for the 

running backs against Ohio State 
was that Peppers, who ran the 
ball just 18 times this season, was 
the team’s leading rusher with 29 
yards on seven carries.

Of course, some of the blame for 

the low statistics in the run game 
as the season progressed falls on 
the development of the passing 
game, which became a focal point 
of Michigan’s offense as fifth-

year senior quarterback Jake 
Rudock 
improved 
drastically. 

However, Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh 
frequently 
speaks 

about striking a balance between 
the running game and passing 
attack, and the Wolverines were 
unable to do that in the latter half 
of the season.

THE 
FUTURE: 
All 
of 

Michigan’s running backs should 
be back next season, and most 
of the Wolverines’ offensive 
line should return as well. The 
running game will have the 
opportunity 
to 
make 
major 

strides in the offseason because 
of the continuity. Freshman 
Karan Higdon, who carried the 
ball 11 times in three games, 
could also factor more heavily 
into the equation.

One option that could spice 

up the rushing attack would be 
if Peppers moved to the position 
on a full-time basis. Harbaugh 
mentioned this possibility late 
in the season but was far from 
committal. 
Peppers 
was 
an 

offensive star in high school but 
spent much of this season, his 
first full one at the collegiate 
level, focusing on the defensive 
side of the ball. If he were to move 
to running back permanently, 
it could give Michigan’s offense 
quite the spark.

Five Things We Learned: SMU

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

Michigan men’s basketball 

coach 
John 
Beilein 
has 

repeatedly said his team is a 
“long way from being good,” and 
the Wolverines showed what he 
meant Tuesday.

In an 82-58 drubbing at 

the hands of No. 19 Southern 
Methodist — Michigan’s third 
non-conference 
loss 
of 
the 

young season — the Wolverines’ 
glaring weaknesses were on full 
display.

There’s 
still 
time 
for 

Michigan to grow — it has four 
straight home games against 
low-tier opponents with losing 
records — but it could be in for 
a rude awakening at the start of 
Big Ten play if these questions 
aren’t answered soon.

Here are five things we 

learned from Tuesday’s loss.

 
1. The bigs still have a long 

way to go.

 
After a month of tinkering, 

Beilein has finally settled on 
sophomore Ricky Doyle at the 
‘5’ 
position, 
with 
freshman 

Moritz Wagner as the first man 
off the bench. But stability in the 
rotation still hasn’t translated to 
stability on the floor, and the 
SMU loss was a prime example.

Mustang big man Jordan 

Tolbert scored 23 points on 
11-for-12 
shooting, 
including 

an astounding nine dunks. The 
Wolverines 
had 
no 
answer 

for him in the paint, allowing 
numerous alley-oops and wide-
open lanes.

SMU 
also 
dominated 

Michigan on the glass, grabbing 
45 rebounds to the Wolverines’ 
20. Wagner and Doyle are 
clearly still Michigan’s best 
options in the post, but that lack 
of defense simply won’t cut it in 
the Big Ten.

 
2. Caris LeVert can’t do it 

all every night.

 
There’s 
no 
question 
that 

senior guard Caris LeVert is the 

focal point of the Wolverines’ 
offense. He leads Michigan in 
scoring with 17.7 points per 
game, and he has excelled as the 
lead guard in Beilein’s offense 
since 
junior 
guard 
Derrick 

Walton Jr. injured his ankle a 
week ago.

But for the second straight 

year, the Mustangs shut down 
LeVert, limiting him to 1-for-
13 shooting and just five points 
— his first single-digit scoring 
performance of the season.

LeVert’s offense has been 

able to carry the team to 
victories against Texas and 
North Carolina State and kept 
Michigan 
within 
striking 

distance for most of a lopsided 
loss to No. 12 Xavier. But it’s 
unrealistic to expect even a 
player of his caliber to be “on” 

every night. The Wolverines 
received 
a 
few 
meaningful 

contributions from the rest of 
the lineup, but they need to take 
more of the pressure off LeVert.

 
3. The Wolverines miss 

Walton...

 
In the first game and a half 

since Walton injured his ankle 
against N.C. State, Michigan 
looked like it might be fine 
without him. The Wolverines 
held off a late charge to beat the 
Wolfpack in Raleigh and rolled 
over Houston Baptist with LeVert 
playing point guard a week later.

But Tuesday was a different 

story, as Walton’s presence was 
sorely missed on both sides 
of the ball. The Wolverines’ 
offense suffered from spacing 

issues all night without its floor 
general, and Michigan could 
certainly have used his 4.6 
rebounds per game. His absence 
likely wouldn’t have accounted 
for the 24-point difference in 
the game, but it’s safe to say the 
Wolverines would love to have 
him back soon.

 
4. ...But other players are 

starting to step up.

 
Michigan’s offense struggled 

to stay in the game Tuesday, but 
it did receive contributions from 
a few players who have been 
largely quiet in the early-season 
box scores.

Sophomore 
guard 

Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman, who was playing 
in Walton’s spot in the lineup 

and 
hasn’t 
been 
a 
prolific 

scorer in his career, scored the 
Wolverines’ first six points and 
finished the game with 15.

On an even more encouraging 

note, junior forward Zak Irvin 
made his biggest stride yet in his 
recovery from September back 
surgery. Irvin had struggled to 
get his shot going early in the 
season, but he flirted with a 
double-double against SMU with 
nine points and nine assists. If he 
can keep up the improvements, 
Irvin 
could 
be 
Michigan’s 

X-factor going forward.

 
5. 
BOLD 
PREDICTION: 

This won’t be Michigan’s only 
20-point loss this season.

 
It’s important to note that 

the Wolverines haven’t had 

more than one 20-point loss 
in a season since the 2007-08 
season, Beilein’s first year at 
the helm. But Michigan has a 
tendency to let at least one road 
Big Ten game get out of hand — 
the Wolverines lost by 19 at Ohio 
State in 2015, by 18 at Iowa in 
2014 and by 23 at Michigan State 
in 2013.

Unless the defense and post 

play drastically improve over 
the next few months, this year 
will be no exception. Even if the 
Wolverines can get back to full 
health, they have to face tough, 
physical Big Ten teams with 
huge size advantages on the 
road, including No. 6 Maryland 
and No. 11 Purdue. A home game 
against No. 1 Michigan State 
will also be a difficult test for 
the Wolverines.

RUBY WALLAU/Daily

Senior guard Caris LeVert leads Michigan in scoring, but he managed just 1-for-13 shooting and five points against Southern Methodist on Tuesday night.
