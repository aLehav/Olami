Researchers find 
website decreases 
suicidal thoughts in 

new doctors

By SANJAY REDDY

Daily Staff Reporter

Upon beginning residency, 

newly licensed doctors often 
feel a combination of inferiority, 
stress and sleeplessness that 
can lead to an increase in 
suicidal thoughts. Fortunately, 
a recent study co-conducted by 
a University researcher shows 
the benefit of a new web-based 
tool to lessen, or even eliminate, 
these feelings.

The study was published in 

early November in the Journal 
of 
the 
American 
Medical 

Association 
Psychiatry. 

Researchers 
concluded 
that 

a 
free 
cognitive 
behavioral 

therapy website can cut the rate 
of suicidal thoughts in first-year 
residents in half. The program 
included four weekly interactive 
modules that covered topics 
like understanding the links 
between 
thoughts, 
emotions 

and behaviors and teaching the 
ability to challenge unrealistic 
thoughts.

Srijan 
Sen, 
associate 

professor of psychiatry at the 
University, 
and 
Constance 

Guille, assistant professor of 
psychiatry 
and 
behavioral 

sciences 
at 
the 
Medical 

University of South Carolina, 
led the research team. The web-
based tool, called MoodGYM, 
offers the same type of therapy 

that mental health professionals 
offer in therapy sessions. It 
was developed at Australian 
National University.

To carry out the study, Sen 

and Guille requested the help 
of 199 medical interns, another 
term for first-year residents. 
Half 
of 
the 
interns 
were 

assigned to use MoodGYM, and 
the other half received general 
information on depression and 
suicide and contact information 
for mental health professionals.

Of those who just got general 

information 
about 
mental 

health, one out of five thought 
about 
suicide 
sometime 
in 

their medical internship year. 
However, only one out of eight 
of the interns who used the 
MoodGYM app thought about 
suicide. 
Additionally, 
most 

assigned to the app continued 
to use it all year.

Guille said a focus of this study 

is to emphasize the importance 
of depression prevention rather 
than treatment after its onset.

“We are showing that we 

can prevent the onset of suicide 
ideation, as opposed to treating 
it once it is already there,” Guille 
said. “It is much more difficult 
to get people into treatment 
once they have mental health 
problems, 
so 
there 
is 
an 

advantage to preventing the 
onset.”

Sen said one of the biggest 

implications of this finding 
is that web-based cognitive 
behavioral therapy, and tools 
like it, can be used to help 
others in high-stress, high-
pressure situations. He said this 
could extend to undergraduates

Demonstration 

addresses minority 
community’s role in 
diversity discussions

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

The cold didn’t stop three 

students from standing in the 
Diag all day Monday with a 
wooden cutout of an elephant 
to advocate for Asian-American 
inclusion on campus.

LSA senior Brendan Wu, 

Engineering senior Sean Liu 

and Business senior Jennifer 
Liu created the event, which 
they called Project Elephant, 
in response to the last week’s 
University-wide 
Diversity 

Summit.

Sean Liu, who is co-chair of 

the University’s United Asian 
American Organization, said 
the 
demonstration’s 
name 

stems from the common idiom 
of the “elephant in the room” 
— meaning an important and 
potentially awkward topic that 
is clearly apparent to all, but 
not discussed.

“We 
felt 
like 
elephants 

in the room where we were 
invited to the party, but not 

active participants,” Sean said. 
“There are issues, there are 
voices, there are people that 
are being left out and they are 
elephants in the room, and we 
want to talk about them.”

While 
attending 
events 

related to the summit, the 
three students said they felt 
as 
though 
Asian-American 

voices were excluded from the 
conversations about diversity 
on campus, prompting the Diag 
demonstration. 

“We felt like we were not 

included in the discourse and 
presentations of the Summit,” 
Wu said. “In some instances, 

Student-run 

teams will work 
over three months

‘Tis 
the 
season 
for 

entrepreneurship.

Dozens of people gathered 

in the East Liberty Street 
headquarters of TechArb, an 
incubator for student startups 
sponsored by the University’s 
Center for Entrepreneurship 
and 
the 
Samuel 
Zell 
and 

Robert H. Lurie Institute for 
Entrepreneurial Studies, for 
the launch of its semi-annual 
startup program Monday night.

The incubator, which was 

founded in 2009, selects a 
number of startups each fall, 
winter and spring semester 
to participate in its out-of-
the-classroom crash course in 
business development.

This fall, TechArb selected 

21 teams from 50 applications, 
which TechArb director Ryan 
Gourley said is the highest 
number of applications the 
incubator has ever received.

Chad Carr 
dies after 
battle with 
brain cancer

COMMUNITY

Carr, 5, united ‘U’ 
community with 
strength during 
yearlong fight

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

The Michigan football faithful 

received 
sad 
news 
Monday 

afternoon when Chad Carr, the 
5-year-old grandson of former 
Michigan 
coach 
Lloyd 
Carr 

and former Hall of Fame safety 
Tom Curtis, passed away after a 
yearlong fight with brain cancer.

Carr was initially diagnosed 

with an inoperable brain tumor 
called Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine 
Glioma 
in 
September 
2014. 

In 
June, 
doctors 
escalated 

his 
treatment 
and 
began 

to provide him some relief. 
But two weeks ago, with his 
condition worsening, Carr went 
into hospice care after several 

attempts 
at 
recovery 
were 

unsuccessful.

Carr’s 
disease 
has 
united 

Wolverines 
and 
rivals 
alike. 

On Nov. 14 at Indiana, the 
Michigan football team wrote 
“#CHADTOUGH” on its helmets 
and dedicated its 48-41 victory to 
Carr. A week later, Michigan State 
and Ohio State wore decals in 
support of Carr on their helmets 
during their game in Columbus. 
More 
statements 
of 
support 

turned up on social media after 
Carr’s mother, Tammi, tweeted 
the news of his passing.

After Carr was diagnosed, 

his 
family 
established 
the 

ChadTough Foundation to raise 
awareness for rare pediatric 
brain tumors such as Carr’s.

“It’s 
incredible 
sadness, 

and I don’t know if it’s going 
to get better any time soon,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 

Harbaugh 
during 
a 
weekly 

radio appearance Monday night. 
“Heaven got stronger … heaven 
has another angel now.”

BLIMPIN ’

Students, faculty to 
attend UN session 
to brainstorm new 
treaty after Kyoto

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

A team of eight University 

students 
and 
two 
faculty 

members will travel to Paris 

for two weeks at the beginning 
of December to observe the 
process of negotiating a new 
treaty 
to 
address 
climate 

change.

The team will attend the 

United Nations’ Conference of 
Parties, with representatives 
from more than 190 countries 
and 
nongovernmental 

organizations, including other 
universities.

The COP will focus on 

creating a treaty to replace the 

Kyoto Protocol, which expires 
in 2020. The Kyoto Protocol 
is an international agreement 
that was adopted in 1997 at the 
United 
Nations 
Framework 

Convention on Climate Change 
to create binding emission 
reduction 
standards. 
The 

conference in Paris will also 
focus on reducing emissions.

“The Conference of Parties 

happens every single year, 
and broadly its role is to help 
nations 
around 
the 
world 

to work to figure out how 
to 
reduce 
or 
manage 
our 

impact on the environment,” 
said Engineering sophomore 
Allison Hogikyan, a member 
of the team. “This particular 
COP we need to rewrite the 
international agreement.”

Hogikyan said the main 

reason the UN allows observing 
parties to attend the COP is to 
increase the transparency of 
the event.

CSG election results released, 
LSA and Rackham face delays

Professor allegedly subject
to extortion plot, report says 

An issue with online 

polling forced 

re-voting for LSA, 
Rackham candidates

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

Results of the Central Stu-

dent Government’s fall 2015 
elections are in, with voters 
selecting representatives from 
the Ford School of Public Poli-
cy, Medical School and School 
of Education — in addition to 
the student who will head the 
Department of Public Safety 
and Security Oversight Com-
mittee. Due to a tie of one vote 
each, no candidate from the 
School of Natural Resources 
and Environment was deemed 
eligible to serve on the CSG 
Assembly.

While those elections have 

concluded, voting is now under-

way for representative posi-
tions from LSA and Rackham 
Graduate School due to an error 
in the online voting system.

According to CSG elections 

director Benjamin Reese, a 
third-year law student, voting 
for each of these two schools 
will run through Tuesday. All 
votes cast during last week’s 
originally scheduled election 
must be recast.

The error stemmed from the 

voting system’s ranking mecha-
nism, a setting that Reese said 
wasn’t enabled when elections 
went live online. Subsequently, 
he said, it was not clear which 
candidate was being voted for 
in the cases of LSA and Rack-
ham. Elections for DPS Over-
sight, as well as those for all 
schools besides LSA and Rack-
ham, were not affected.

LSA sophomore Lisa Pomer-

anz won the DPSS Oversight 
elections with 568 votes over 
Engineering sophomore John 
Houghton who had 318. Public 

Policy senior Sloane Forbush 
won the representative seat 
with 37 votes over Public Policy 
junior Sara Dagher, who had 27.

With 51 votes, second-year 

Medical student Alia Ahmed 
won the Medical School rep-
resentative position by a mar-
gin of 11 votes over a write-in 
candidate, second-year Medi-
cal student Benjamin D. Long. 
Education 
graduate 
student 

Michael Chrzan, a write-in can-
didate, won with a total of five 
votes to be a School of Educa-
tion representative.

All of the eligible voters from 

each school are compiled in 
a list, though votes can come 
from anyone who visits the 
voting website. Reese said the 
administration checks through 
the voters and compares them 
to the master list to make sure 
those capable of voting are vali-
dated.

“Everyone’s allowed to vote, 

if they’re not on that list we 
have to see whether they’re 
enrolled or not,” Reese said.

Reese said a member of the 

University 
administration 

supervises the elections. The 
elections director is not privy to 
the actual lists, because of laws 
under the Family Educational 
Rights and Privacy Act that 
protect students’ information 
from being released to other 
students.

Write-ins to fill the vacan-

cies for all available schools 
included a write-in nomination 
for Michigan Football coach 
Jim Harbaugh, and voters for 
the School of Education pro-
vided a double ticket of Bernie 
Sanders and Ben Carson for the 
representative position.

“It 
happens 
every 
year,” 

Reese said of the joke write-ins.

Unnamed faculty 
member says man 

attempted to 
gain $10,000 

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

A 52-year-old University 

professor says he was the 
victim of an extortion plot, 
according to a report by the 
Ann Arbor News. 

The professor, who has not 

been named, accused 24-year-
old Mark Anthony Mitchell 
of attempting to extort more 
than $10,000 from the profes-
sor, based on a police report 
obtained by The Ann Arbor 
News. Mitchell did not deny 
or admit to one count of stalk-
ing and one count of using a 
computer to stalk and commit 
a crime.

Mitchell posted a Craig-

slist ad for a “massage escort,” 
and the professor respond-
ed. According to The Ann 

Arbor News, the professor 
told the police there was no 
sexual activity between the 
two. However, according to 
the records, the young man 
received about $6,000 to keep 
their relationship a secret.

The professor and Mitchell 

have two conflicting stories. 
While the professor denied 
a sexual relationship ever 
occurred, Mitchell said their 
relationship included sex.

The 
professor 
reported 

the blackmail allegations to 
police on Oct. 23 and drafted 
a lengthy and specific account 
of the two men’s interactions 
between Sept. 12 and Oct. 22. 
Mitchell was then arraigned 
on Oct. 28.

The account claims that 

the professor first contacted 
Mitchell online about sched-
uling a massage during a 
planned trip to Lansing, Mich.

According to the statement, 

though 
there 
were 
“some 

friendly exchanges,” no mas-
sage appointment took place. 
In one event, Mitchell told 
the 52-year-old that it was his 

birthday, but he had no money 
to celebrate. According to the 
statement, the professor felt 
sorry for Mitchell and sent 
him money.

After the professor report-

edly scheduled a massage 
appointment with Mitchell at 
an Ann Arbor motel, but then 
left when Mitchell allegedly 
tried to touch the professor’s 
genitals, the professor began 
receiving 
numerous 
phone 

calls and texts from Mitchell 
demanding more money. In 
total, the professor claimed that 
Mitchell demanded $10,000. 
According to the report, Mitch-
ell began threatening to ruin the 
professor’s career.

Diane Brown, spokeswoman 

for the University’s Department 
of Public Safety and Security, 
said she could not comment on 
the case because it did not hap-
pen on campus.

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald told The Ann Arbor 
News that the professor is still 
employed with the University. 
He did not have any further 
comment on Monday.

Campus Inn closes for renovation

LSA senior Jack Schul-

te discussed the end of his 
experience working as a 
bellhop at the Dahlmann 
Campus Inn on Thayer 
Street and North Univer-
sity Avenue. Employees 
will be out of work as the 
hotel closes temporarily 
for renovations.

What is happening at 

the Campus Inn?

So a firm came in — 

AJ Capital. They own a 
chain of hotels around 
different 
college 
cam-

puses, so they bought the 
hotel, and they are going 
to renovate it.

How long will they be 
closed for renovations?

I’ve been hearing four 

to 
five 
months. 
They 

should be open before 
graduation, or that’s what 
they’re planning on.

How many students 
work at the Campus 

Inn?

There’s a lot. I wouldn’t 

say 
there’s 
that 
many 

Michigan students. I don’t 
think I work with any Uni-
versity of Michigan stu-
dents, but there’s a lot of 
Eastern (University) stu-
dents and a lot of Washt-
enaw Community College 

students who work there. 
I’d say at least 50 percent 
of the employees I work 
with are at least part-time 
or full-time students.

How will this affect you?

I will be out of a job, but 

they’ve been really nice 
to their employees. They 
will be paying me for all 
of December and the first 
week of January as if I 
was working. I was actu-
ally planning on leaving 
for winter semester and 
trying to find something 
else more applicable to my 
career goals so it’s worked 
out really well for me.

“The UN wants this content 

not to happen in a black box,” 
Hogikyan said. “They want 
people around the world to 
know what’s happening, so they 
invite these people to come as 
observers.”

Engineering senior Matthew 

Irish, 
who 
will 
also 
be 

attending the COP, said it will 
be one of the most important 
negotiations looking into the 
future of climate change.

The 
team 
of 
University 

students and faculty will attend 
as observers, meaning they 
will get to sit in on all of the 
negotiations over the course 
of the two-week conference. 
Though the team members will 
be able to voice their opinions, 
they will ultimately not be 
considered when the countries 
come to an agreement. 

The team will update a 

website 
and 
social 
media 

outlets throughout their time at 

the conference. Irish said they 
hope to raise awareness for 
what is happening by bringing 
their first-hand observations 
back to campus.

“We are trying to actually 

bring back some information 
that 
will 
help 
our 
whole 

University community to have 
a really good ear for what’s 
going on,” he said. “A big part of 
us coming back home is letting 
people know what we think of 
the agreement.”

Additionally, 
the 

University was recently one 
of 218 universities to sign 
the 
American 
Campus 
Act 

on 
Climate 
Pledge, 
which 

maintains 
the 
campuses’ 

commitment to sustainability 
in light of the upcoming COP.

Discussing how the COP 

will affect the University’s 
environmental policies, Irish 
said the policies cannot directly 
influence the University, but 
would make for an interesting 
comparison.

“This 
international 

agreement wouldn’t directly 

tell the University you have to 
do anything,” he said. “We have 
all these goals and it would be 
interesting to compare them 
to the goals that are set by 
different countries coming out 
of this agreement.”

Irish added that he wishes 

they were more progressive.

“My personal opinion is we 

are not doing quite enough,” 
he said. “We are just going 
with the flow. We are just 
kind of doing what will now be 
required for all utilities in the 
U.S., but I think that is going to 
change.”

Overall, Irish said he looks 

forward to the opportunity 
to see such an important deal 
negotiated.

“I’m just really excited to 

be there and see it all happen 
firsthand,” Irish said. “I’m 
really apprehensive. If you 
judge by the past, things don’t 
look good, but I think people 
realize the gravity of the 
situation. I’m nervous to see 
what happens but I’m really, 
really excited.”

we were actively ignored. Our 
role and existence in society was 
really, really downplayed or left 
out completely.”

According to the fall 2015 

enrollment report from the 
Office of the Registrar, Asian 
students account for 11.2 percent 
of the University student body.

Sean Liu said when they asked 

questions at panel events, their 
questions, on issues such as how 
to help reduce discrimination 
toward Asian Americans on 
campus and make the University 
a more inclusive environment 
went unanswered. 

“We feel that these are 

large topics that are not being 
addressed 
and 
are 
being 

overlooked. You can argue that 
the administration is unaware 
of these issues, but even when 
Brendan, Jenn and I brought 
up these issues, they seemed 
dumbfounded and even glanced 
over it,” he said.

Wu 
said 
he 
hopes 
the 

conversation 
from 
Project 

Elephant will prompt others to 
think about diversity on campus.

“By expressing this, we’re 

hoping that people will at the 
very least think a little bit more 
about how they conceptualize 
diversity and inclusion and if 
they have felt excluded from 
certain areas in the past, maybe 
this will make them more 
comfortable sharing.”

Echoing Wu, Sean Liu said he 

hoped this event will catalyze 
future conversation on a broader 
scale.

“I plan to personally try to 

use this, and use the Diversity 
Summit, and use some of these 
issues that we’ve talked about 
today as conversation starters 
both within our community 
and bridge other communities,” 
he 
said. 
“We 
believe 
that 

these issues of inclusion don’t 
only apply to us, they apply to 
everyone, all students of color, 
and 
these 
underrepresented 

groups.”

AFL-CIO to help 
rehab 300 vacant 
homes in Detroit

At a press conference on 

Monday, Detroit Mayor Mike 
Duggan announced the city’s 
plans to partner with the 
AFL-CIO to rehab hundreds 
of homes in several Detroit 
neighborhoods, including the 
Bagley and East English Village 
neighborhoods. 
The 
Detroit 

Land Bank will transfer the 
rights of 300 blighted homes to 
the union, which will in turn 
use union labor to rehabilitate 
the homes. The union will then 
sell the homes and split the 
profits with the city, the Detroit 
Free Press reported on Monday. 

“We are trying things that 

haven’t 
been 
done 
before,” 

Duggan said. The project will 
expand if the initial pilot proves 
successful. 

Richard 
Trumka,, 
the 

AFL-CIO president, said in a 
statement that the program is 
placing special emphasis on 
creating construction jobs for 
Detroit residents, women and 
people of color. 

Since his election in 2014, 

Duggan has initiated several 
new efforts to combat blight in 
the city, including programs 
to ramp up demolitions of 
vacant homes too damaged for 
renovation. The city has also 
instituted a massive program 
to auction off homes in more 
neighborhoods. 
In 
these 

programs, 
winning 
bidders 

are required to renovate and 
inhabit 
the 
homes 
within 

several 
months 
of 
their 

purchase. 
Neighborhoods 

initially 
targeted 
for 
this 

program 
 
included 
historic 

Boston-Edison, as well as 
the Osborn and Marygrove 
neighborhoods. Duggan has 
also relied on partnerships with 
other local players for similar 
rejuvination programs. 

‘U’ economists 
predict job growth 
for next two years

University Economics Prof. 

George Fulton, who directs the 
University’s Research Seminar 
in Quantitative Economics, led a 
study that broke down expected 
job growth in Michigan in the 
next two years. 

Fulton 
and 
his 
team 

predicted that 126,000 new jobs 
will be added by the state of 
Michigan by 2018, with 61,100 
being added in 2016 and 64,800 
by 2017. 

“From the perspective of 

how the economy has been 
performing overall in growing 
out of the prior severe recession, 
things are looking pretty good. 
The environment has stabilized 
and progress has been fairly 
impressive,” Fulton said in a 
press release.

Joan 
Crary, 
research 

assistant at the RSQE, said 
six out of 10 jobs in the trade, 
transportation 
and 
utilities 

sectors will originate in the 
knowledge-based professional, 
scientific 
and 
technical 

subcategories, with the rest 
being in the administrative 
support subgroup.

While 
jobs 
are 
growing, 

Michigan’s 
capital 
income, 

per capita GDP, employment-
to-population 
ratio 
and 

educational 
attainment 
still 

rank low, researchers said. 

“What this tells us is that 

although we’ve made a fair 
amount of progress recently, we 
have a ways yet to go,” Fulton 
said.

NEWS BRIEFS

“We chose this cohort based 

on their proven ability, or the 
ability that they indicated in 
their application, to execute on 
their idea,” Gourley said. “As 
a bare minimum we require 
that each team has at least 
two people, two students from 
the University of Michigan. 
We really tried to get a broad 
swathe of teams.”

Gourley said the application 

consists of a series of questions 
to assess a team, its idea and 
the stage in the development 
process. He noted having an 
array of projects, as well as 
feasible goals, plays a key role in 
the selection process.

If multiple teams submitted 

similar 
projects, 
organizers 

selected the strongest proposal 
of the bunch.

Such diversity is evident in 

this fall’s incoming class. The 
selected 
startups 
represent 

a wide range of focus, from 
manufacturing 
sustainable 

water bottles to developing 
virtual tours for the apartment 
search process. Team members 
come from a variety of the 
University’s 
schools 
and 

colleges and age groups — from 
freshmen 
to 
post-doctoral 

candidates.

“We really have a wide 

representation 
of 
students 

working 
on 
both 
products 

and services, both high-tech 
and 
low-tech, 
approaching 

problems from every angle 

imaginable at the University of 
Michigan,” Gourley said. 

Those selected are given 

access 
to 
mentorship, 

educational 
workshops, 

workspace, material support 
and the TechArb community 
for a three-month period.

The 
workspace, 
which 

participants can access 24/7, 
includes 
whiteboards, 
two 

private 
meeting 
rooms, 
a 

kitchenette, office supplies, a 
printer, a foosball table and walls 
emblazoned with inspirational 
quotes like “passion never fails” 
and “experiment, fail, learn, 
repeat.”

Gourley said TechArb works 

hard to cultivate a collaborative 
community.

“TechArb is only as great as 

the people who make it up,” he 

said. “It’s a community of like-
minded people that also have a 
high potential for a high impact. 
When you get such bright and 
interesting people in a room, 
really interesting things start 
to happen. So that’s the goal of 
TechArb is to connect all these 
people in the same place so they 
can see what magic happens.”

At Monday night’s event, 

James 
Holloway, 
the 
vice 

provost for global and engaged 
education, praised the students 
for their desire to help others 
as evidenced by their startup 
ideas.

“I think this is a really 

exciting, inspired place to be 
right 
now,” 
Holloway 
said. 

“I’m really awed by this group. 
You’re 
imaginative, 
you’re 

creative and you’re developing 

things that will help people.”

Holloway 
reassured 

participants 
that 
the 
real 

value of the program is not a 
startup’s explicit success, but 
experiencing and learning from 
the overall ups and downs of 
building a business. 

“Your 
ventures 
may 
not 

work out the way you expect,” 
he said. “The success is going 
to be that you learn how to do 
this work, you learn how to be 
creative, you learn how to be 
collaborative, you learn how to 
interact with others that are 
very different, you learn how to 
make something that has value 
for the world. That’s success. I 
think the real value is going to 
come from spending time with 
this group of people, learning 
from each other.”

“I think that to some extent, 

it can extend down to college 
students and anyone in school,” 
Sen said. “This shows the value 
of these web-based tools and 
potentially 
also 
smartphone 

apps and nontraditional mental 
health resources because they 
would allow students to access 
them on their own time without 
having to fit it into the schedule 
of a traditional therapist.”

T
o be best friends

A 

few weeks ago, my best 
friend Alaina and I were 
at Salvation Army picking 

out a costume 
for 
Halloween. 

Thursday night, 
we were Garth 
and 
Kat 
from 

Saturday 
Night 

Live, but Friday 
night, she got to 
pick. 

“I just want to 

look like a girl,” 
she said, throw-
ing up her hands. 
“Last 
night 
I 

looked like a potato.”

***
One of my best friends, Alaina, 

hates when I use “best friend” in the 
plural. “They can’t all be best. That’s 
not what best means,” she says, talk-
ing with her hands.

When I say someone I haven’t 

talked to in years is a “best friend,” 
she goes on a rant about this and 
that, loyalty and honesty and what-
ever. She gets exasperated over little 
things like who gets the title of “best 
friend,” things any logical person, in 
my opinion, would regard as trivial.

But I maintain that I have about 

10 best friends. My best friend from 
sophomore year of high school, Erin, 
moved to some town in Wiscon-
sin when we were 15. She checked 
in later that year to tell me a local 
megachurch was burning copies of 
the Harry Potter series for promot-
ing witchcraft.

“I’m scared,” she said, but I fig-

ured she could fend for herself and 
left her to it. We ran into each other 
at Lollapalooza last summer.

See? Besties.
I wonder if someday Alaina will 

be like Erin — off in some remote 
corner of Wisconsin, hoarding her 
Harry Potter books beneath a floor-
board in her room before the militia 
comes looking for contraband.

“OK, fine, you say we’re best 

friends,” Alaina says, waving her 

arms wildly, “but how many people 
have you said that to? Twenty?”

Who are the others? I won’t list 

them for time’s sake. But there’s my 
best and first friend, Jack, who I talk 
to more than any person I don’t live 
in the same house with, and who 
will probably be the best man at 
my wedding. When we talk, I have 
the sensation of opening a favorite 
book to a random page and finding 
I remember the characters and plot 
just as well.

But there are other best friends 

I don’t really talk to. There’s the 
best friend I got in a fistfight with. 
That ended the best-buds stage of 
our friendship. And he’s still my 
best friend because I owe him that, 
because at one point we would have 
done anything for each other. I still 
honor that. We may not be best bud-
dies, but he’s my best friend.

And then there’s the best friend 

I fell in love with, by accident, and 
whose doorstep I showed up on 
halfway across the country, expect-
ing who knows what, and for whom 
I found that I was too late, that we 
were going to stay best friends — 
nothing more, nothing less.

I think that’s really what it comes 

down to: A best friend is someone 
you love.

***
Appearances are another thing 

I think any logical person would 
regard as trivial. I prefer to look 
clever, and I told her, “We need a 
costume that makes you look hot 
and me look funny: I got it.”

But she didn’t like my idea of 

going with a “sluts and wizards” 
theme. So, she decided we were 
being Danny and Sandy from 
Greece. “Simple,” she said. “Just 
wear jeans and a white T-shirt and 
slick your hair back.”

Except that I’m an asshole, and I 

thought this was a pretty stupid idea, 
so I showed up dressed as a wizard 
anyway. Boom: wizards and sluts. 
I wore a white T-shirt and jeans 
underneath my costume, though, to 

change when Alaina went berserk 
on me. Honestly, I was just trying to 
get a rise out of Alaina because I was 
bored, and I wanted to look funny, 
and I liked the attention from people 
at the party. Alaina was upset, but 
she let me keep the wizard cloak on 
because, she agreed, it was sort of 
funny. She looked hot, and I looked 
funny. Perfect. So then we got on this 
bus to go to a party downtown and I 
figured everything was fine.

Fast forward to the bus back from 

the party: Alaina is crying and cov-
ered in fake blood, because I found a 
bottle of fake blood and told her it’d 
be funny if we changed from Sandra 
Dee and a wizard to dead Sandy and 
a dead wizard. The bus is broken 
down at a gas station 10 minutes 
outside Detroit. It’s been a half an 
hour. My friend Connor is lying on 
his back in the parking lot, chain-
smoking cigarettes. Alaina refuses 
to speak with me, and is in a corner 
crying tears of blood. She is freezing 
to death in a Sandy costume because 
she just wanted to look hot.

I took off my wizard cloak and 

covered her up with it. And just like 
that, I was unintentionally dressed 
as her Danny Zuko. I didn’t want to 
be. She wouldn’t be freezing if she’d 
just gone as a fur-covered Wild 
Thing and I’d gone as Max, like I’d 
said we should.

But she cared about all this. About 

looking good for once. About who 
her best friend is.

My point is this: You never real-

ly know what people care about, 
whether that’s stupid, little titles or 
looking good. But if you care about 
them, and I do, then you start to 
care about how they feel, even if you 
think what they care about is stupid.

So Alaina, I’m sorry. You’re not 

my best friend. But I do love you. I 
hope that’s enough.

P.S. I’m sorry I ruined your night 

and covered you in fake blood.

The real cost of education

“Everything is going to be OK,” my dad 

assured me as I sat cross-legged on my bed, 
pressing my phone against my ear and sup-
pressing a fit of formidable sobs. His compo-
sure did little to quell the onset of emotions I 
experienced; if anything, it intensified them.

For some context, here is a brief timeline of 

unfortunate events:

About a month ago, my dad was terminat-

ed from his job of 18 years with no severance 
pay, no unemployment benefits and very little 
experience navigating the 21st-century job 
market. Not one week later, my mom’s union 
announced its decision to strike — a strenuous 
effort that offered little in the way of compen-
sation for its participants — which cut her pay 
in half and forced her to work overtime to make 
up the difference. And precisely one hour prior 
to my writing of this article, my dad called to 
tell me that we are at risk of losing our house.

My family has never been what one would 

deem “financially stable.” When I was growing 
up, we received welfare benefits as my mom 
searched for a full-time job. Most of our food 
came from church pantries, our clothes from 
Goodwill. Over time, though, things gradu-
ally became more tolerable. My mom found 
work, and we were living relatively comfort-
ably on a salary of $60,000 for our family of 
four. Extravagance was still out of the ques-
tion, but at least we were stable. One thing that 
remained consistent throughout the course of 
my childhood was my dad’s job, which con-
tributed more than half of our income once my 
mom reentered the workforce. For it to van-
ish so abruptly was not just shocking — it was 
absolutely devastating.

“I just can’t not work,” my dad told me over 

the phone. “It doesn’t feel right. I need to keep 
busy. I need to get out there.”

“What can I do?” I asked him over and over 

again. “I want to help.”

“You just stay in school,” he replied. “Know-

ing that you’re out there bettering yourself is 
enough. I don’t want you to end up like us. I 
want you to be comfortable.”

This rationale does not console me in the 

slightest, even though I knew he was right. My 
parents never attended college and have always 
emphasized the importance of a quality educa-
tion — the fact that I am studying at the Uni-
versity is not only a source of pride for them, 

but also a one-way ticket to a life of financial 
security, which, among other things, is what 
they have always wanted for me. My dad reit-
erates how delighted he is that I am in school 
in every conversation I have with him, but in 
spite of his gratitude, I cannot help but feel a 
sense of overwhelming guilt about my detach-
ment from the pressing issues that currently 
plague my family. I have a roof over my head, 
a meal plan and running water. I have access 
to an array of opportunities for advancement. I 
am comfortable and content; they are not, and 
there is absolutely nothing I can do about it.

Giving up on academia is not an option, and 

even if it is, it is not a particularly appealing 
one. Some days I feel as though I am not only 
pursuing higher education for myself, but for 
my family as well. Much more is at stake for me 
than just a degree — I am launching my lineage 
in the direction of a new lifestyle of prosperity. 
I am leading a crusade of upward mobility, but 
it is not without its anxieties.

While my parents worry about paying the 

bills, I worry about the fact that I am not wor-
ried about anything remotely financial. I am 
thankful for the luxuries of university life, but 
agonize over the fact that it may come at the 
expense of my relationship with my parents. 
There is a glaring disconnect that resurfaces 
whenever I mention my classes or organiza-
tions, and they counter with an anecdote 
about a new obstacle that has pervaded their 
sense of security. I can do nothing to ease the 
burden of poverty for them except prevail 
over my studies, and at least for now, that is 
enough for them.

“I love you, Lauren,” my dad told me. “I am 

so proud of you.”

I hung up the phone and pondered our situ-

ation for a long time. I am angry, I am pow-
erless, and I am more determined than ever 
before. My family may not have the means to 
afford much in the way of amenities, but we do 
have each other. They offer unconditional sup-
port as I work my way through the system so 
we may one day achieve a better life, together. 
It is not guaranteed, but it keeps me going and 
it keeps them hopeful, and at the moment, that 
is all we need to get by.

I 
 

have spoken about the gym community 
that I have become a part of in the past, 
but have hesitated to speak the word 

“CrossFit” out of fear for 
what response I will get. 
Usually, when I mention 
that I do CrossFit, I am 
met with a condescending 
eye roll and a sarcastic 
remark about being in a 
cult. I usually laugh along 
and shrug it off — at this 
point, I have recognized 
that trying to argue the 
true purpose of CrossFit is 
futile against anyone who 
has never experienced it.

In this article, though, I am not being cau-

tious. I am not talking about the “gym I go 
to off campus,” because shrinking the com-
munity I am a part of to this size is insulting 
to the things it has given me, and the people 
who make up this community. With the recent 
events in Paris and other parts in the world, 
there is no place I would rather be on Thanks-
giving than at home with my family and the 
members of CrossFit Burlington. 

I performed the “Murph” workout for the 

first time on May 25, 2015. That Memorial 
Day, I rolled out of bed at 7 a.m., pulled 
on a pair of shorts and a T-shirt and went 
downstairs. Less than one hour later I found 
myself standing outside CrossFit Burlington 
with approximately 50 individuals, about to 
take off on our first of two miles. The rain had 
just stopped, and because I had never done 
this workout before, I optimistically looked 
forward to it. However, those who had done 
the workout before were incredibly nervous, 
making me realize I had no idea what I was 
getting into. The timer sounded, and we all 
took off down the street. Exactly 62 minutes 
and 51 seconds later, I found myself on my 
back in a pool of my own sweat, gasping 
for air, thinking about how this workout 
was barely a fraction of the difficulties that 
soldiers face on a daily basis.

“Murph” is a CrossFit workout dedicated 

to Navy Lieutenant Michael Murphy, who 
was killed in Afghanistan on June 28, 2005. 
Lt. Murphy’s story is well known by many, 
partially due to the book and later movie 
“Lone Survivor,” and because he is one of 
the many war heroes that CrossFit gyms 
across the country pay tribute to in a small 
way. The workout, which was Lt. Murphy’s 
favorite, is a grueling one-mile run, 100 pull-
ups, 200 push-ups, 300 squats and another 
one-mile run — all while wearing a 20-pound 
 

weight-vest.

Every Memorial Day, CrossFit gyms across 

the country perform the “Murph” to celebrate 
this war hero. The workout is a symbol of our 
appreciation for what he and others have 
done for our country. Some boxes — CrossFit 
gyms — even do Hero Week and perform a 
different workout dedicated to a fallen soldier 
for seven days in a row. Some boxes perform 
“Murph” six months after Memorial Day on 
Thanksgiving morning. 

There is a mutual understanding, while we 

sweat through workouts like “Murph,” that 
what we are doing is not for us. What we are 
doing is the smallest token of appreciation for 
fallen heroes like Lt. Murphy, for those who are 
on active or inactive duty, for the individuals 
suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder 
and for the families and friends of all of those 
who have served our country. I am proud to 
be part of the CrossFit community for reasons 
like these.

This Thanksgiving morning, while I 

remain at school in Michigan, I know my 
brother and sister will be getting out of bed 
in Vermont and making their way to CrossFit 
Burlington to line up once more to complete 
the “Murph” workout. It will probably be 
snowing, just like it was last Thanksgiving. 
Even so, Ali, Tommy and the other members 
of the CrossFit Burlington community will 
not care, because as soon as they hear “three, 
two, one, go!” the snow will be the last thing 
on their minds.

LAUREN SCHANDEVEL | VIEWPOINT

The “Murph”

Dear Governor Snyder

D

ear Gov. Snyder,

I campaigned for you 

in 2014 because I thought 

that your prag-
matic, common-
sense leadership 
was taking the 
state in the right 
direction. 
You 

balanced 
our 

budget, 
grew 

our 
economy 

and 
did 
your 

best to elevate 
the 
governor’s 

office above the 
political fray. I 
believed that you 
were the kind of leader who made 
rational, tough choices, politics 
be damned — the kind of governor 
Michigan needed.

I still think you’re that kind of 

leader. But your decision to request 
the president to “pause” before 
admitting additional refugees into 
the state and country on the heels 
of the Paris terrorist attacks didn’t 
reflect the sound, judicious decision-
making that I’ve come to expect 
from your choices.

You defended your decision as 

apolitical, sensible and in the best 
interest of Michigan’s security. But, 
given the widely publicized xeno-
phobic fearmongering by some 
high-profile Republican presidential 
candidates this fall, I find it hard to 
believe that your decision was based 
solely on a desire to protect Michi-
ganders.

There isn’t any substantial evi-

dence — let alone definitive proof 
— that any of the attackers entered 
Europe through a refugee pro-
gram. Most of the terrorists were 
born in Europe. Two possibly 
entered Europe by way of Greece, 
but it’s believed that they snuck 
in through Greece’s borders — not 
through a refugee program com-
plete with the strict background 
checks that characterize the Unit-
ed States’ asylum process.

Even if the Paris attackers had 

been granted formal entry to Europe 
through a refugee program, it still 
wouldn’t have justified a reduction 

in the United States’ refugee admit-
tance. There are simply too many 
substantive differences in both the 
number of refugees entering and 
the differences in ability to impose 
stricter background check require-
ments between Europe and the 
United States.

Between January and August 

of this year, an estimated 350,000 
refugees immigrated to Europe, 
often through southern European 
nations already suffering from 
economic and political instabil-
ity. The huge numbers of refugees 
at European borders on any given 
day have overwhelmed the Euro-
pean Union’s efforts to screen 
each individual. Once inside the 
EU, they can travel between coun-
tries without facing border checks 
or additional screening.

Geographically removed from the 

crisis in the Middle East, the United 
States doesn’t face these same pres-
sures, and consequently, the United 
States admits far fewer refugees. 
The United States plans to accom-
modate 10,000 Syrian refugees next 
year. Just 200 Syrian refugees have 
resettled in Michigan this year. 
That’s a far cry from the 800,000 
refugees Germany alone expects 
to cross its borders this year. And 
unlike in Europe, where mass cross-
border flows of people make exten-
sive background checks difficult, 
the United States subjects each refu-
gee to a rigorous review process and 
background check that lasts 12 to 18 
months on average.

You were right to call on the 

Obama administration to take mea-
sures to prevent ISIS from attack-
ing the United States. Given ISIS’ 
repeated threats against the West, 
an attempted attack on United 
States soil doesn’t seem to be a ques-
tion of if, but rather, when.

But focusing on refugees ignores 

the real vulnerabilities in United 
States border security, and reflects 
a basic misunderstanding of where 
ISIS’ true strength lies. ISIS has 
proven itself adept in using uncon-
ventional communication channels 
to connect with people overseas.

This is crucial to their overall 

strategy, allowing them to turn nat-
uralized Europeans and Americans 
into ISIS fighters. Most of the Paris 
attackers were Europeans. Moham-
med Emwazi, a British ISIS opera-
tive, killed at least seven Western 
hostages in Syria. Of the 68 people 
arrested in the United States for 
supporting ISIS activity thus far, 55 
are American citizens and 43 were 
born in the United States. None 
were Syrian.

However, the fact that European 

and American ISIS operatives pose 
a statistically larger threat to the 
United States doesn’t preclude a 
threat from any other group, includ-
ing refugees. The United States 
should maintain its high standards 
for background checks into refu-
gees’ personal and family history. 
But with some of the strictest stan-
dards in the world, it’s hard to envi-
sion a scenario where this purely 
hypothetical threat justifies barring 
some of the world’s most vulnerable 
people from seeking refuge in the 
United States.

You were the first governor to 

attempt to bar refugee resettle-
ment. In doing so, you ignited a 
political firestorm. Half of United 
States governors have now refused 
to allow Syrian refugees to resettle 
in their states.

You told National Public Radio 

that you thought your position 
on refugee resettlement was “a 
thoughtful, common-sense one.” 
But if common sense tells us any-
thing, it’s that we should update our 
positions when it becomes clear they 
are misguided.

You have the opportunity to show 

the country that you are still the 
same considerate, principled and 
objective leader you demonstrated 
yourself to be in the past. Leverag-
ing the new details that evidence 
refugees did not carry out the Paris 
attacks, you should rise above the 
fear that has clouded our country’s 
judgment. Reverse your decision to 
try to bar Middle Eastern refugees 
from resettling in Michigan.

TV REVIEW
‘High Castle’ proves 
Amazon’s acumen

New dystopic series 
adds substance to 
Amazon’s lineup

By DREW MARON

Daily Arts Writer

There’s a scene in the pilot of 

Amazon’s newest original drama, 
“The Man in the High Castle,” 
that will stick 
in your mind 
regardless 
of 
whether 

you 
choose 

to 
continue 

watching. 
It involves a 
routine traf-
fic stop where 
resistance 
truck 
driver 

Joe 
Blake 

(Luke Kleintank, “Gossip Girl”) is 
stopped by a highway patrolman. 
The encounter feels normal and 
neighborly despite the patrolman’s 
swatstika. Then, out of nowhere, 
ash starts snowing down on the 
characters. The highway patrol 
man explains, in a casual tone, that 
the ash comes from the hospital 
where various “undesirables” are 
being incinerated. The characters 
then go along with their day. 

“The Man in the High Castle,” 

based on the acclaimed novel by 
the late Philip K. Dick, represents 
Amazon’s latest foray into original 
content, and it does not disappoint. 
The series comes to us from execu-
tive producer Ridley Scott (“The 
Martian”), whose classic film 
“Blade Runner” revolutionized 
science-fiction for the screen and 
brought Dick’s work to the atten-
tion of Hollywood. Since then, the 
once-ignored author has received a 
plethora of big-screen adaptations 
including “Total Recall,” “Minor-
ity Report” and the criminally 
underrated “A Scanner Darkly.”

“The Man in the High Castle,” 

however, represents a huge leap 
forward in adapting Dick’s work. 
Free from the restrictions of main-
stream feature films, “The Man 
in the High Castle” is an epic, 
sprawling dystopia that is one part 
political thriller and one part hor-
rifying parable of what happens 
to a nation engulfed by fascism. 
Though the series does feature 
many characters connected to 

the struggle of the resistance — a 
major but welcome change to the 
source material — the most unset-
tling aspect of the series aren’t big 
set pieces (though there are plenty) 
but the quiet moments of resigna-
tion, where we witness Americans 
who have moved on with their 
lives following the most heinous 
war crimes in human history.

Like all great speculative fiction, 

“The Man in the High Castle” is as 
much about today’s world as it is 
about post-World War II America. 
In both “The Man in the High Cas-
tle” and, unfortunately, our own 
world as well, challenging author-
ity and people’s personal percep-
tions is a near-impossible task. The 
only hope for a better future exists 
as a series of film reels called “The 
Grasshopper Lies Heavy,” which 
shows an alternate reality, one 
where the Allies have won the war. 
Ironically, it seems the only hope 
for us to have any meaningful, 
intelligent discourse is through 
platforms like “The Man in the 
High Castle.”

As in the novel, we follow a 

number of different perspectives, 
including Juliana (Alexa Davalos, 
“Clash of the Titans”), a young 
woman seeking the film reels’ cre-
ator, the mysterious Man in the 
High Castle. On the way, she runs 
into fellow resistance fighter Joe 
Blake (Luke Kleintank, “Max”) 
who may have some secrets of his 
own.

The series also sees Cary-

Hiroyuki Tagawa (“Mortal Kom-
bat”) as Nobusuke Tagomi, the 
Trade Minister of the fictional 
Pacific States of America, whose 
allegiances lie against the tyr-
anny of the Reich. Tagomi, along 
with Juliana, are truly the main 

heroes of the show, and Tagomi’s 
storyline on the show will hope-
fully mirror the tremendous arc 
he goes through in the novel.

Finally, Rupert Evans (“Hell-

boy”) plays Frank Frink, a half-
Jewish 
factory 
worker 
and 

boyfriend of Juliana whose luck 
finally runs out after his signifi-
cant other becomes the target of 
the SS. Rufus Sewell (“Dark City”) 
rounds out the cast as Obergrup-
penfuhrer John Smith, whose 
solid, albeit par for the course per-
formance might be unfairly com-
pared to the Jew Hunter played by 
Christoph Waltz in “Inglourious 
Basterds.”

It’s the world of the “Man in 

the High Castle” itself, however, 
which truly stars as the series’ 
main character. Despite the show’s 
bleak tone, the cast and crew cre-
ate a highly engrossing alternate 
universe that is always believable. 
In particular, the much freer Japa-
nese territories showcase a fusion 
of Eastern and Western cultures 
that reminds American viewers 
how ignorant the view of the Allies 
as all-good and the Japanese as 
equal to the Nazis truly is.

The series has already ignited 

a great deal of discussion, and for 
good reason. Despite its genre 
and its more fantastical elements, 
“The Man in the High Castle” 
might be the most political show 
currently produced. Though some 
of the characters, notably Tagomi, 
aren’t given their deserved spot-
light in the pilot, the first episode 
of the “Man in the High Castle” 
proves that Amazon can stand 
on its own as a creator of qual-
ity content and that the time for 
challenging, 
thought-provoking 

entertainment is far from over.

“What the hell is an Obergruppenfuhrer?”

ALBUM REVIEW
Freddie Gibbs sells 
out in new album

By SHAYAN SHAFII

Daily Arts Writer

Freddie Gibbs is nothing if not 

consistent. The man is admittedly 
one-dimensional and deadpan in 
his delivery, 
but my god, 
is there any-
one else who 
has gone this 
long without 
a single weak 
project? Just 
when 
his 

mixtapes 
became 
noticeably formulaic and safe (box 
Chevys and backwoods appear 
in everything he touches), he sur-
prised us all with the surprisingly 
versatile Piñata, the best rap album 
of 2014, which is not up for debate. 
Gibbs set the bar realistically high 
with mixtapes that brought a high-
er level of artistry to street rap; he 
was the only dude who could give 
you chills through a song titled 
“Let Ya Nuts Hang.”

Up until now, Gibbs has had a 

flawless track record. He under-
promised and overdelivered with 
all of his album-quality mixtapes, 
and matched the higher expec-
tations when it counted most: 
album time. Albums understand-
ably come with higher standards, 
and Shadow of a Doubt falls pain-
fully short of what was supposed 
to be his breakout project.

Straight from the jump, Shadow 

feels uncharacteristically generic. 
It’s as if he fleshed out all the ele-
ments that made his music unique 
and special, leaving only tidbits 
of an album he couldn’t seem to 
make. There are still flash-in-the-
pan moments when he seems to 
get it right, but they’re few and 
far between. There’s no jarring 
street-journalism, 
no 
smooth 

MadLib-curated soul sample, no 
left turns — nothing. He does just 
enough for the album to be toler-
able.

For example, he has a song 

titled “Narcos,” where the most 
gruesome line is “Chillin’ in my 
grandma basement / Probably 

dreamin’ ‘bout some cocaine.” On 
“Mexico” he recruits Tory Lanez 
(aka the “Great Value” Ty Dolla 
$ign) to yell “My whip color look 
like Rihanna / And all my bitches 
like designer.” Gibbs doesn’t get 
on much better, with three verses 
about nothing, not even selling 
drugs. “Mexico” confirms that 
Gibbs has become too concerned 
with being a “rapper” and less 
concerned with being Freddie 
Gibbs.

If that isn’t bad enough, what 

follows is the worst song of this 
dude’s career. “Packages” is so 
embarrassing I thought it was 
meant to be ironic at first. Gibbs, a 
man from Gary, Ind. (home of the 
Jackson 5), has absolutely nothing 
to do with the triplet flow that’s 
been booming in Atlanta the past 
few years. So when I heard him 
ad-libbing “I keep a pistol on me” 
with what sounded like his best 
Quavo impression, I was con-
vinced this was a joke. But then 
the signature 808 Mafia sirens 
went off, and that was that. Gibbs 
sold the fuck out.

That’s not to say Shadow Of A 

Doubt is all bad. Gibbs reached 
out to fellow Jeezy-hater and leg-
end Gucci Mane for “10 Times,” 
another great Midwest trunk-
knocker he’s so well known for 
pioneering. 
The 
song 
segues 

straight into “Lately,” which 

surprisingly features R&B style 
crooning weaved into thumping 
percussion. There’s even some of 
the smooth melodies he experi-
mented with on Piñata.

“Forever and a Day” is the 

obvious standout track, where he 
scrolls back to the autobiographi-
cal bars that immersed and won 
over his fans to begin with. For 
the first time on the album we get 
some real feelings. “I done did a lot 
of bad thangs’ just to get change / 
I done took it some levels that a lot 
of n****s won’t go” is hesitantly 
spit with just the right amount of 
regret. “Slung crack rock / Never 
had a wicked jump shot” summa-
rizes his opportunities in Gary: 
basketball or eight ball.

But what ultimately makes 

Shadow a disappointment is that 
this is the first time Freddie Gibbs 
has come up against a hurdle that 
wasn’t comfortably below him, 
and he failed. He sold out to find 
workarounds, 
forced 
artificial 

personas that hadn’t existed in 
his six-year run and marginalized 
himself to be as safe and boring as 
possible. Gibbs was never known 
for trying to be “cool” or “smart,” 
but he had a polished identity, 
and that’s all we can ask for. The 
instant he compromised himself 
and put on an olive green bomber 
jacket, Shadow of a Doubt was 
always going to be a shit album.

Daily Arts Writer

In “Brooklyn,” the film adap-

tation of Colm Tóibín’s novel, 
we see the careful rendering of 
a story that 
has 
been 

told 
one 

thousand 
times: 
the 

immigrant 
narrative. 
But “Brook-
lyn” distin-
guishes itself 
through its creators’ ability to 
draw the loveliness out of a situ-
ation fraught with hardships.

“Brooklyn” begins at a fork 

in the road for Irish country 
girl Eilis Lacey (Saoirse Ronan, 
“The Grand Budapest Hotel”). 
She can stay with no definite 
prospects 
in 
Enniscorthy, 

Ireland with her cherished 
mother (Jane Brennan, “The 
Tudors”), sister (Fiona Glascott, 
“Indian 
Summers”) 
and 

friends, or she can immigrate 
to the unknown in America. As 
illustrated by the title of the film, 
she chooses the latter and sets 
out for Brooklyn. Eilis receives 
accommodations at a boarding 
house run by the amusingly 
tart Ms. Kehoe (Julie Walters, 
“Paddington”) and finds a job 
at a department store. Some of 
the most humorous moments 
of the film come from her 
interactions with the women 
who have lived in America for 
a while, as Eilis’s awkwardness 
and 
social 
anxiety 
in 
the 

city is juxtaposed with their 

urban American experience. 
These relationships between 
similarly aged young women 
could 
have 
easily 
devolved 

into 
rancorous 
competition 

for cheap amusement, but they 
always make an effort to help 
and guide Eilis.

But even with friends in 

her boardinghouse and guid-
ance from an Irish priest (Jim 
Broadbent, “Big Game”), Eilis 
is overcome with homesickness. 
Ronan a dual citizen of Ireland 
and America, sensitively por-
trays the frustration of being 
torn between two places.

As she adjusts to her new life, 

Eilis starts to take and excel at 
her accounting classes at Brook-
lyn College, unapologetically 
pursuing her dream of being an 
accountant despite being the 
only woman in the class.

Her 
homesickness 
evapo-

rates quickly when she meets 
Tony Fiorello (Emory Cohen, 
“Smash”). Tony is a sweet, pup-
pyish Italian boy with whom 
she locks eyes from across the 
room at an Irish dance. Their 
courtship is a nostalgic whirl-
wind that will make even the 
most cold-hearted of critics 
sigh and long for 1950s-style 
bathing suits. But the sentimen-
tality of their love never borders 
on sickly sweet or annoying 
because their romance is always 
firmly rooted in the reality of 
their lives.

Just as everything starts to 

seem a little too perfect, tragedy 
strikes back home, pulling Eilis 
out of Brooklyn and sending her 
back home to her mother. At 

home, she finds comfort in the 
familiar. She also finds another 
suitor, Jim Farrell, (Domhnall 
Gleeson, “Ex Machina”), and 
the whole town seems to be 
pushing them together. As she 
decides between Brooklyn and 
Ireland, and between Tony and 
Jim, Eilis seeks to answer the 
question of the movie: how to, 
as a person of multiple identi-
ties, define the word “home.”

The emotional effects of the 

film would be lost without the 
command of the camera by 
director John Crowley (“Closed 
Circuit”). Crowley creates a 
subtle but undeniable binary 
between America and Ireland 
in his use of cinematography, 
shown most clearly in the scenes 
on the beach in both countries. 
In New York, Tony takes Eilis 
to Coney Island, and they must 
dash between the hoards of peo-
ple to get to the water to swim, 
kiss and laugh. But in the sweep-
ing shots of the Irish beach she 
goes to when she returns, there 
is no one around for miles. With 
Eilis in the same bathing suit 
in both scenes, we can see her 
being entirely comfortable in 
either setting. Crowley presents 
this opposition, and we watch as 
she chooses her future.

“Brooklyn” is not just an 

immigrant narrative. It is the 
touching story of a young woman 
caught in a state of uncertainty 
 
— uncertainty in her family, 
career and relationships. The 
film may be set in the 1950s, but 
its messages of the confusion of 
youth and divided identity will 
endure for years.

FILM REVIEW
‘Badlands’ need work

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

AMC runs on “The Walking 

Dead,” and for good reason. The 
zombie apocalypse series is still 
television’s 
biggest 
hit, 

even though 
its 
ratings 

are 
lower 

than in prior 
seasons. 
This strong 
viewership 
becomes 
even 
more 

important as 
AMC relies 
on 
“The 

Walking Dead” to endure through 
an extended transitional period 
following the loss of “Breaking 
Bad” and the recently concluded 
“Mad Men.” Already, the network 
has released a spinoff, “Fear the 
Walking Dead,” and now plans to 
use “The Walking Dead” ’s sub-
stantial audience to build a lead-
in for its new martial arts series, 
“Into the Badlands.”

Set in a post-apocalyptic world 

where guns have been banned and 
seven barons fight for power, “Into 
the Badlands” presents a world 
where 
hand-to-hand 
combat 

reigns supreme with visual flair. 
This strong display masks some 
lackluster storytelling, but it can’t 
hide every shortcoming.

“Into the Badlands” follows 

Sunny (Daniel Wu, “The Man with 
the Iron Fists”), the best warrior 
(or “Clipper”) under Baron Quinn 
(Marton Csokas, “The Lord of the 
Rings”). Right away, the series 
establishes its protagonist as a 
force to be reckoned with. Draw-
ing from Chinese kung-fu influ-
ences, action director Stephen 
Fung (“Tai Chi Hero”) and mar-
tial arts coordinator Huan-Chiu 
Ku (“Fist of Legend”) develop an 
over-the-top style, where combat-

ants move with almost inhuman 
speed and agility as they fight to 
the death. One standout scene is 
a rain-drenched battle between 
Sunny and four bowler-hat-wear-
ing assassins sent by Quinn’s rival 
baron, the Widow (Emily Bee-
cham, “28 Weeks Later”). The 
fight is shot with cinematic flair; 
long takes and slow motion create 
an engrossing sequence that never 
overuses any one effect.

As Sunny, Wu and his stunt dou-

ble Tengfei Tang (“The Forbidden 
Kingdom”) bear the most weight in 
selling these sequences, they’re up 
to the task — not just pulling off the 
choreography, but bringing a cool 
confidence to the warrior. Sunny 
is a conflicted fighter who swears 
loyalty to Quinn, a man who saved 
him years ago, but wishes to define 
his own path in life. This desire 
manifests itself in Sunny’s forbid-
den relationship with a doctor, 
Veil (Madeleine Mantock, “Edge 
of Tomorrow”). Always stoic, Wu 
hides Sunny’s torment under a col-
lected demeanor. It’s a straightfor-
ward character and could benefit 
from more nuance as Sunny tries 
to define his existence.

Sunny’s difficult situation is 

heightened after he rescues the 
mysterious young man, M.K. (Ara-
mis Knight, “Ender’s Game”), in 
the episode’s opening. Claiming 
to come from somewhere beyond 
the Badlands, M.K. is supposed 
to bring a new hope to Sunny, but 
the character is incredibly grat-
ing. Whether it’s poor writing 
or bad delivery on Knight’s part, 
M.K. usually comes off as a smart-
ass brat. After hearing Sunny’s 
name, he snidely remarks, “Why? 
Because you brighten everybody’s 
day?” If that reads poorly on paper, 
it sounds even worse when spoken. 
Hopefully, M.K. improves, as the 
show has invested a lot in explor-
ing the character’s enigmatic 
origins and abilities. However, if 
Knight can’t endear M.K. to the 

audience, his journey of discovery 
will instead become an unwel-
come labor for viewers who would 
rather spend time with someone 
else — potentially on another net-
work.

The other storylines also 

struggle to distinguish them-
selves. Quinn deals with a dis-
contented son, Ryder (Oliver 
Stark, “My Hero”), who the 
warlord believes isn’t ready 
to take his place. Meanwhile, 
Quinn’s new wife, Jade (Sarah 
Bolger, “Once Upon a Time”) 
competes with Quinn’s first wife 
and current matriarch, Lydia 
(Orla Bradley, “American Odys-
sey”). While not necessarily ter-
rible, these threads lack any real 
intrigue in their current forms. 
“Into the Badlands” needs to 
improve its storytelling or risk 
becoming an unwelcome delay 
between excellent fight scenes.

However, there are other 

elements that stand out for the 
new series. A strong production 
design creates an interesting 
atmosphere and sparks inter-
est in the show’s larger world. 
Quinn’s plantation-like fortress 
calls into question how other 
pockets of civilization and cul-
ture have developed and how the 
other barons manage their hold-
fasts. However, there are some 
elements that don’t mix well: 
the Eastern-influenced, warrior 
class Clippers occasionally clash 
with the Southern antebellum 
and old West aesthetic that most 
of the other characters have.

As a companion to “The 

Walking Dead,” “Into the Bad-
lands” works well as a visually 
engrossing action series. It’s 
lighter fare than its emotion-
ally exhausting lead-in, but 
“Into the Badlands” needs to 
strengthen its narrative to live 
up to its own visual standards 
and to keep its promising audi-
ence.

Why we should kill 
the ‘American Novel’

By KARL WILLIAMS

Online Arts Editor

In 1868, a novelist named 

John William De Forest wrote 
an essay for The Nation called 
“The Great American Novel,” 
wherein he nominated Harriet 
Beecher Stowe’s “Uncle Tom’s 
Cabin” for the role. While few 
would maintain his evaluation 
of Stowe’s novel and the only 
reason 
anyone 
cares 
even 

slightly about De Forest is 
because of that essay, the notion 
of the Great American Novel 
has persisted.

The Great American Novel 

is, essentially, the idea that 
a novel can be the definitive 
expression 
of 
its 
time, 

capturing a unique American 
cultural and historical milieu. 
It’s a hackneyed version of the 
national epic in the tradition 
of Homer and Virgil, a work 
that attempts to unify a nation 
in a common language. It’s an 
idea also rooted in American 
triumphalism and its timid little 
brother, American insecurity. (I 
once heard someone say James 
Joyce’s “Ulysses” was the Great 
American 
Novel, 
because, 

I think, it’s so consistently 
ranked as the greatest novel 
ever that he assumed it was 
written by an American.) As 
Americans, we want to be the 
best at everything, and we want 
a literature that reflects our 
magnificence while meeting a 
certain criterion of greatness.

Most often, people talk of 

the Great American Novel with 
derision, and occasionally write 
an entire novel satirizing the 
idea. But you can also write a 
novel, name it after the Great 
American Idea, splay it across 
the cover, then get in Oprah’s 
Book Club (the highest literary 
achievement) and receive a 
cover in Time proclaiming you 
as the Great American Novelist. 
The GAN oscillates somewhere 
between absurdity and validity, 
but it’s time it found a secure 
home among the former.

First of all, why can there 

only be one? That’s the single 

greatest 
problem 
with 
the 

entire idea. Literary culture 
isn’t “The Apprentice,” and 
there’s no Donald Trump — 
thank God — to serve as a 
cultural arbiter, deciding the 
fate of American fiction once 
and for all. The Great American 
Novel 
effectively 
works 
to 

delegitimize important novels 
by turning America’s literary 
tradition into a sword fight (not 
swashbuckling) between dead 
white dudes like Nathaniel 
Hawthorne, Herman Melville, 
Mark 
Twain 
and 
F. 
Scott 

Fitzgerald.

It’s an obsolete term, also, 

because it historicizes fiction 
at the expense of aesthetic 
value. It’s a convenient idea 
for historical and journalistic 
purposes, and it is used most 
often in these circumstances. 
But literature isn’t made just 
to assimilate into a historical 
narrative, 
and 
the 
best 

literature squirms out of it’s 
historical moment. The GAN 
turns literature into passive 
historical texts, only relevant 
for their ability to transport 
us to a past America so we can 
understand what it was like to 
live in that time.

Thus, 
according 
to 
the 

criteria of the GAN, literature is 
purely mimetic: Its sole function 
is to represent the world in 
which it was created. But all 
literature, 
and 
furthermore 

all art, is critical. To recreate 
the world is to critique it — to 
attempt to perfect it. No writer, 
not even the greatest, can hold 
a mirror up to nature without a 
signature crack.

Every novelist’s vision of 

America is limited not just by 
their 
personal 
imaginative 

vision, 
but 
by 
place. 

Contemporaries Henry James 
and Mark Twain have markedly 
different views of and concerns 
for America, not only for their 
personal differences, but for 
the simple fact they lived in 
different parts of America. 
America is a gigantic country, 
and the reality is that its size 
and diversity of experience 
make the kind of narrative 
unity entailed by the GAN, at 
the very least, unlikely.

Yet valuing the historicity 

of a novel is problematic not 
only 
because 
it 
minimizes 

the efficacy and agency of 
fiction, but also because the 
novels that survive getting run 
over by time’s winged chariot 
become what we know of their 
historical moment. To borrow 
a phrase from T.S. Eliot: They 
are 
that 
which 
we 
know. 

Novelists aren’t historians, and 
we shouldn’t require them to 
be. We can’t trust a novel for 
historical 
accuracy 
because 

it effectively creates it’s own 
historicity. Historical moments 
are 
transformed 
by 
the 

representations that survive 
them. Continuity with the past 
is tricky. While the past is never 

dead, it’s transformed into a 
ghost of what it was. So when 
you take a novel, for example 
“The Ambassadors,” and say 
“This is what it was like to be an 
American in Europe in 1903,” 
you apply flesh to a phantom. 
It’s never going to stick.

Quite 
often, 
American 

novels, 
certainly 
some 
of 

its best ones, serve as overt 
critiques of American culture. 
F. 
Scott 
Fitzgerald’s 
“The 

Great 
Gatsby” 
demolishes 

the 
idealization 
of 
wealth 

and 
unfettered 
capitalism’s 

excesses and failures; Herman 
Melville’s masterpiece “Moby-
Dick; or, The Whale,” my 
vote for the greatest work 
of fiction produced by an 
American, 
subtly 
ironizes 

the idea of the monomaniacal 
entrepreneur, the Rockefellers 
and the Carnegies whom we 
still idealize, who chase the 
objects of their desires free of 
moral concerns; Twain’s “The 
Adventures 
of 
Huckleberry 

Finn” eradicates any ethical 
justification for racism.

Nothing tells us how full of 

shit we are more often than 
our greatest novels. What the 
fuck even is the American 
experience? Here’s the grand 
irony of the Great American 
Novel. In theory, the GAN would 
be a celebration of America. 
But a look at the common 
candidates 
(gunpowder 
for 

any postcolonial or feminist 
critic) shows a list of novels that 
critique the principles and ideas 
at the very heart of American 
life and the hypocrisies that 
lurk beneath the surface. 

More specifically, the battle 

for 
who 
is 
considered 
an 

American and what constitutes 
Americanness is a conflagration 
that has raged for the entirety 
of American history, but the 
novel has always proven to be 
an essential tool for those ill-
equipped for the fight. Fiction 
continuously 
redefines 
who 

and what America is. Contrary 
to the logic of the GAN, there’s 
no America that novelists must 
strive to express. The novel will 
never create a definitive version 
of America: It will continue to 
create new ones.

The GAN provides critical 

criteria 
that 
don’t 
really 

help 
evaluate 
the 
quality 

of a fictional work. “Moby-
Dick” gives insights to what 
America was like in the pre-
Civil 
War 
era, 
but 
these 

insights supplement the artistic 
achievements. 
They’re 
not 

the achievements themselves. 
“Moby-Dick,” 
despite 
its 

greatness as a work of fiction, 
can’t be the Great American 
Novel, because it fails to mirror 
the cultural milieu in which it 
was created.

No one will ever write the 

Great American Novel, but not 
because it’s a great difficulty. 
They won’t, because it was a 
stupid idea from the beginning.

Flaherty leads historic night

By BRANDON CARNEY 

Daily Sports Writer

She missed her first four shots, 

but Katelynn Flaherty won’t 
walk away from Monday’s game 
against South Carolina Upstate 
remembering that.

Instead, the sophomore guard 

will look back at her next 16 
attempts, 13 of which she made 
on the way to a career-high 34 
points as the Michigan women’s 
basketball team (4-0) had no 
trouble taking down the Spartans 
(4-2), 119-61, finishing with the 
second-most points scored in 
program 
history 
since 
the 

beginning 
of the NCAA era.

“When I started making shots, 

then everything started flowing 
in my game offensively,” Flaherty 
said. “Not getting down when I 
miss shots has been a part of my 
growth this year. I think I’ve 
changed my mentality a lot. I 
work on shooting all the time. 
I expect myself to make those 
shots, so I just kept shooting and 
it happened.”

The Wolverines ended the 

first half with 65 points, their 
most since 1980, by shooting 
a remarkable 69 percent from 
behind the arc, making 64 
percent of their total shots in the 
period.

In the first half, 17 of Michigan’s 

23 field goals were assisted by 
eight different players.

“I think we’re really unselfish,” 

Barnes Arico said. “I think we 
always look to make the extra 
pass and get the best shot off and 
not the first shot. We did a really 
great job of that tonight. We had 
four players tonight with five 
assists. That’s pretty incredible.”

With the Wolverines looking 

flat from the start, and scoring 
threats 
like 
Flaherty 
and 

sophomore 
forward 
Jillian 

Dunston shooting a combined 

0-for-6 in the opening five 
minutes, Barnes Arico felt her 
team needed an energy spark.

Soon 
after 
introducing 

freshman guard Boogie Brozoski 
and 
junior 
guard 
Danielle 

Williams, Michigan turned on its 
press defense, went on a 7-0 run 
and never looked back.

Brozoski, Williams, Flaherty 

and junior guard Siera Thompson 
stifled USC Upstate’s offense 
and opened the second quarter 
making nine consecutive baskets.

While 
Flaherty 
was 
the 

primary scorer, Williams and 
Brozoski carried the Wolverines 
defensively. The pair combined 
for eight steals, as Michigan 
forced 27 Spartan turnovers. 
Brozoski also finished behind 
Flaherty with 16 points and 
co-led the team with five assists.

“Once we got into the press, 

the energy was there,” Brozoski 
said. “When we press, and we 
get up and have that energy, we 
definitely intimidate teams a 
little bit and get them to turn the 
ball over.”

Thompson proved to be the 

motor behind the Wolverines’ 
high-powered offensive attack, 
scoring 
13 
points, 
including 

making all three 3-point shots 
she attempted. But the guard 
drove Michigan’s attack starting 
from the defensive glass, where 
she grabbed a team-high eight 
rebounds.

Senior guard Madison Ristovski 

carried the Wolverines when they 
were cold in the opening minutes, 
scoring nine of Michigan’s opening 
11 points, all from beyond the arc. 
Watching her teammates struggle 
to score, the senior stepped up 
and lifted the Wolverines from 
a lackluster start into a historic 
night. She finished with 11 points 
and five assists.

“Madison has really been a 

spark for us in our last couple 
games,” Barnes Arico said. “She’s 
been super consistent shooting 
the ball and she’s one of the best 
passers we have. Her consistency 
has really been a staple for us and 
it’s great to see that from her as 
a senior.”

While there was much to cheer 

about Monday night in Crisler 
Center, the loudest moment came 
when fifth-year senior Halle 
Wangler scored her first career 
point with a minute left in the 
contest.

“(The team) was more excited 

for her than they were for their 
own individual success,” Barnes 
Arico said. “Halle is a great kid 
and brings a lot of energy and 
passion every single day, and for 
her to have the opportunity to do 
that tonight was special.”

Between 
Flaherty 
and 

Wangler’s 
career 
moments, 

Michigan’s offensive explosion 
will be one for the record books, 
as the Wolverines continue to 
show their attacking consistency 
early in the season.

“It was just a great night for 

the whole team,” Brozoski said. 
“Everyone 
scored. 
Everyone 

impacted the game in some way. At 
the end of the day, it doesn’t come 
down to points. It comes down to 
how hard you play, and everyone 
gave it their all out there.”

‘M’ wears orange 
in support of Carr

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

Just hours before the Michigan 

women’s basketball team tipped 
off 
against 
South 
Carolina 

Upstate on Monday, the Michigan 
community was grieving. That 
afternoon, 5-year-old Chad Carr, 
the grandson of former Michigan 
coach Lloyd Carr and former Hall 
of Fame safety Tom Curtis, passed 
away after a 15-month battle with 
an inoperable brain tumor.

To honor Carr, the Wolverines 

wore 
orange 
T-shirts 
with 

“#CHADTOUGH” written across 
the chest during their game. The 
team came out of the tunnel for 
warmups dressed in the shirts 
and also sported them while on 
the bench.

The coaching staff also geared 

up in orange, representative of the 
#ChadTough Pray for a Miracle 
fundraising event that distributed 
orange rubber wristbands to raise 
awareness and support for the 
cause. Some of the Wolverines 
wore the wristbands around their 
socks on Monday, and all of the 
profits from each wristband went 
directly to pediatric brain tumor 
research at C.S. Mott Children’s 
Hospital in Ann Arbor.

A moment of silence was held at 

Crisler Center prior to Michigan’s 
win.

Chad’s fight with a form 

of cancer known as Diffuse 
Intrinsic Pontine Giloma (DIPG) 
garnered endless support from the 
Michigan community and beyond, 
most 
prominently 
with 
the 

Michigan football team writing 
“#CHADTOUGH” on the back of 
its helmets.

But as the only Michigan team 

in action Monday, the women’s 
basketball program took its chance 
to honor Chad with the shirts, and 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico 

spoke about what Chad’s fight 
meant to her and her team.

“It was really hard,” Barnes 

Arico said. “We live in the same 
community, and my children go 
to school with their children. For 
them to share their story with us 
over the last 15 months has been 
incredible and an inspiration to 
myself, to our players and to my 
family. Our team has volunteered 
for the Chad Run last year and 
this year. We all feel like Chad and 
the Carrs are part of our family.”

The Wolverines heard the 

news during a shootaround 
earlier today, and as soon as they 
did, they decided they would 
honor Chad and the Carr family 
during the game. Many players 
tied their shoes with orange 
laces in support.

“It’s such a difficult time for 

everyone to go through, especially 
the 
family,” 
said 
sophomore 

guard Katelynn Flaherty. “(Chad) 
inspired everyone. It really puts 
a perspective on everyday life, 
and I think it reminds us not 
to take anything for granted 
and appreciate where we are, 
everyone around us and just being 
able to step out on the court.”

As Barnes Arico mentioned, 

the Wolverines participated in 
the second annual RunTough 
fundraiser last month, helping 
raise over $120,000 to benefit the 
ChadTough Foundation.

After the 119-61 win over USC 

Upstate, the players, coaches and 
two of Barnes Arico’s daughters 
put on the #ChadTough shirts and 
gathered in the middle of the court 
for a picture to show their support.

“Any way that we can honor 

them, by wearing orange and 
supporting their family, is what 
we wanted to do,” Barnes Arico 
said. “My little one came running 
up to me after and said, ‘Mommy, 
we did this for Chad.’ ”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Beilein strives to 
solidify rotation

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball 
team 
has 
been 

scheduled to appear in the 2015 
Battle 4 Atlantis for almost a 
year, but this week, its travel 
schedule seems to be a perfect 
response to the weather. 

The 
Wolverines 
left 
for 

the 
eight-team 
tournament, 

hosted by the Atlantis Paradise 
Resort off the shores of Nassau, 
Bahamas, on Monday evening — 
barely 48 hours after Saturday’s 
record-setting 
snowstorm 
in 

Ann Arbor.

While Ann Arbor is currently 

almost 50 degrees colder than 
the Bahamian beaches, Michigan 
coach John Beilein said he 
doesn’t expect the trip to prove 
distracting.

“We’ll keep (the players) pretty 

busy,” Beilein said. “Hopefully, 
we don’t have anybody coming 
back with tans. … It’s the fans 
that get to have some break time 
before the winter hits. It won’t 
be us.” 

The Wolverines can’t afford 

break 
time, 
anyway. 
Their 

86-70 loss to Xavier at Crisler 
Center on Friday highlighted 
the team’s question areas, like 
their ability to defend against 
a physical post presence, or 
run an offense heavily reliant 
on ball-screen action around 
the perimeter against a larger, 
more 
experienced 
defensive 

backcourt.

Michigan 
fans 
will 
see 

changes 
come 
Wednesday’s 

first-round matchup against No. 
18 Connecticut, but Beilein is 
keeping them close to the vest.

After Friday’s loss, Beilein 

indicated 
that 
junior 
Mark 

Donnal’s status as the starting 
center would depend on his 
performance, and that of other 
big men, over the course of 
the next few practices. Beilein 
acknowledged there will be 
changes to the starting lineup but 
wouldn’t say at which positions.

“I do know where they’ll be,” 

Beilein told reporters Monday. 
“You just don’t know.”

Beilein said he’ll continue his 

quest to trim his team’s rotation 
from 12 closer to eight over the 
course of the tournament.

That process, however, is 

complicated by senior guard 
Spike Albrecht’s extended rehab 
process from the same surgery 
former forward Max Bielfeldt 
underwent prior to the 2014-
15 season. Given the program’s 
experience with the procedure, 
Beilein 
said 
the 
recovery 

process was initially expected 
to be similar, but listed two main 
differences.

For one, Albrecht had the 

surgery on both hips, while 
Bielfeldt only needed it on 
one. Meanwhile, the nature of 
Albrecht’s position as a perimeter 
player makes the procedures 
more difficult to recover from, 
as his role requires more overall 
movement.

Working Albrecht back into 

a rotation presents a challenge 
for a roster that currently has a 
multitude of players with a foot 
in and a foot out of the regular 
rotation, like freshman forward 
Moritz Wagner and sophomore 
guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman. Several other players’ 
roles remain undefined, like 
sophomore forward Kameron 
Chatman, 
redshirt 
freshman 

forward D.J. Wilson and redshirt 
sophomore 
guard 
Duncan 

Robinson.

The experiment of playing 

12 players in a given contest is 
unsustainable, Beilein said. All 
the same, the Wolverines are set 
to play three high-profile games 
in a 48-hour window, and depth 
can only serve as an asset.

The 
Michigan-Connecticut 

matchup begins at 9:30 p.m. 
on Wednesday. With a win, 
the 
Wolverines 
would 
play 

the winner of the Charlotte-
Syracuse game in a second-
round matchup at 3:30 on 
Thanksgiving 
Day. 
With 
a 

loss, Michigan would play that 
game’s loser at 9:30 p.m.

Michigan’s Thanksgiving report 
card: Offense remains strength

By JUSTIN MEYER

Daily Sports Writer

Campus was emptying on 

Monday 
as 
students 
skipped 

out early for the holiday. But 
Michigan hockey assistant coach 
Brian Wiseman’s voice echoed 
throughout practice at Yost Ice 
Arena, his presence as evident as 
ever.

“Come on — harder!” Wiseman 

said. “We’re going to play hard.”

The college hockey season can 

be a grueling affair: 25 weeks of 
non-stop practice and travel to 
hostile barns in various frozen 
parts of the country each weekend. 
Even coming off a tough series 
against No. 10 Boston University, 
any letdown is unacceptable.

The Wolverines set out to 

capitalize on a weak schedule 
early this season. Their progress 
toward that goal has been the 
subject of much debate.

An upcoming series against 

Dartmouth marks the end of the 
first third of Michigan’s (6-2-1) 
regular season. The Daily grades 
the Wolverines’ performance so 
far.

Offense: A-minus

The obvious bright spot before 

a single practice commenced 
this season was that Michigan’s 
offense is a juggernaut that can 
hang with the best in the country. 
Early this season, the production 
has been driven by a plethora of 
young talent.

The Wolverines are led in 

scoring by breakout freshman 
forward Cooper Marody, who has 
tallied six goals and five assists. 
At 1.22 points per game, Marody 
ranks third among all Division I 
freshmen.

The top three point-getters 

for the team, Marody and fellow 
forwards 
Kyle 
Connor 
and 

Brendan Warren, are all freshmen.

Some of this performance is 

due to the quality talent Michigan 
brought in this offseason, but a 
greater part is attributable to the 
Wolverines’ depth.

Michigan is the fifth-ranked 

scoring offense, and 12 different 
players have found the back of 
the net this season. The stats 
Marody and Warren record are 
both significantly inflated by 
playing for the third line, and 
consequently 
against 
inferior 

competition.

JT Compher, a junior, continues 

to be a sparkplug. The captain 
opens games at a breakneck 
pace and has helped the top line 
generate 13 goals.

Junior Boo Nieves has elevated 

his game as well. Nieves centers 
one of the best possession lines in 
the NCAA, flanked by Connor and 
senior Justin Selman.

The result is that any line is a 

threat to score.

For the forwards, the biggest 

misstep of the season came in a 
4-0 loss to Robert Morris. The 
Wolverines came out sluggish and 
looked hesitant in the offensive 
zone.

That 

anomaly 
aside, 
though, 

Michigan 
consistently 
crashes 
the 

net hard and 
moves the puck 
with 
fantastic 

efficiency. Few teams in the 
country have a chance at shutting 
down this high-powered unit.

Defense: B-minus

There is good news for the 

Wolverines: The defensive unit 
looks improved. The bad news is 
that it still has a long way to go.

Through 
nine 
games, 
the 

defensemen 
have 
learned 
to 

comfortably protect the puck and 
break out fluidly. But some areas 
have improved at a crawling pace. 
Clearing rebounds and moving 
the puck in the defensive end 
remain points of focus in practice. 
Turnovers in the offensive end 
have led to a few bad odd-man 
rushes.

There are marginal statistical 

improvements 
as 
well 
as 

intangible additions. This season’s 
unit is allowing 3.1 goals per 
game. At this time last year, the 
Wolverines were allowing 3.3.

Michigan also added quite 

a bit of speed and finesse with 
freshmen Nicholas Boka and 
Joseph Cecconi. Both are NHL 
Draft picks and have played 
significant minutes this year.

Overall, Michigan has to be 

happy with the progress.

Sophomore 
standout 
Zach 

Werenski has looked tremendous 
at times and a bit overwhelmed 
at others. The 18-year-old is still 
a bright spot, though, adding a 
scoring threat to the defense.

As a team, the Wolverines are 

allowing opponents to convert 
far too high a percentage of shots. 
Part of this problem stems from 
a lack of physicality. Michigan 
ranks 55th out of 60 NCAA teams 
in penalty minutes this season.

The best defensive games so 

far came in a 5-2 win against 

Rensselaer 
Polytechnic 
and 
a 
4-2 

win Saturday 
at 
Boston 

University. 
Both 
times, 

an 
energetic 

Wolverine 

squad smothered chances and 
cleaned up in the front of the net.

This defensive unit won’t rank 

as one of the best in the NCAA, 
but it is on track to finish ahead of 
last season.

Goalie: C

Michigan’s 
goalies 
haven’t 

quite slept through games this 
season, but it’s been easy at times 
to forget they are there at all.

Senior 
Steve 
Racine 
has 

emerged to take the starting 
job in the last three games after 
a deflating battle with junior 
Zach Nagelvoort. Neither goalie 
handled the competition with 
consistency, displaying flashes 
of brilliance and long periods of 
sloppy play.

Racine and Nagelvoort rank 

59th and 73rd, respectively, in 
save percentage among eligible 
goalies 
this 
season. 
That’s 

inexcusable, but the C rating is 
justified because the play is not as 
bad as the numbers suggest.

Subpar defending has hurt 

both Racine and Nagelvoort. 
Sharp 
defenders 
can 
easily 

mask a goaltender’s deficiencies, 
while poor play often leaves the 
netminder shouldering all the 
blame.

Racine made several show-

stopping saves over the weekend, 
but posted just a .893 save 
percentage in the series. The 
senior is lighting quick out of his 
butterfly, and can move post to 
post well. At times, though, his 
focus seems to wane.

Make 
no 
mistake: 
The 

improvement in net over the last 
month has been marked. Still, it’s 
hard to imagine Michigan relying 
on its goalies to win a tight game 
this weekend. There is a sense of 
optimism that goaltending is on 
the upswing, but the evidence has 
yet to arrive.

***

The non-conference schedule 

has been a rollercoaster for 
the Wolverines. At times they 
have showed talent, resilience 
and desperation; some games 
would be better described by 
complacency. 
The 
question 

remaining is whether the team is 
complete enough to be great.

“I didn’t know where we would 

be (at this point),” said Michigan 
coach Red Berenson. “I knew 
we didn’t have a tough schedule 
and that we would have to take 
advantage of that. You might have 
a good win-loss record and not be 
the real deal. I think our team is 
the real deal.”

Michigan 
hosts 
Dartmouth 

on 
Friday 
and 
Saturday 

before starting Big Ten play. 
The Wolverines appear to be 
tentatively passing the eye test at 
the early-season break. They’ll 
have to do much more by the time 
March rolls around.

“I think our team 
is the real deal.”

Intensity high despite OSU’s loss

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

As Michigan football fans 

across 
the 
country 
watched 

their team’s path to the Big Ten 
Championship Game get a little 
less direct, the team itself waited 
somewhat blindly.

The Wolverines were still on 

the plane home when Michigan 
State upset Ohio State, ruining 
the winner-take-all buildup to 
“The Game” on Saturday. The 
plane had Internet, so Michigan 
could follow along, but it didn’t 
get the channel to watch Michael 
Geiger’s game-winning field goal.

Even with their fate out of their 

own hands, the Wolverines say 
Ohio State’s loss won’t diminish 
Saturday’s 
game. 
Michigan 

defensive captain Joe Bolden was 
asleep when the game ended, 
but when he woke up, he said he 
wasn’t too shaken up by the upset.

“Whatever,” 
Bolden 
said. 

“If they both lost, it (would 
be) better for us, but that can’t 
happen, right?”

Indeed, one of Michigan’s two 

chief rivals had to win on Saturday. 
And as a result, the Wolverines’ 
only path to Indianapolis requires 
them to beat Ohio State and Penn 
State to knock off the Spartans in 
East Lansing.

Since 
Michigan 
plays 
the 

Buckeyes at noon and Michigan 
State hosts the Nittany Lions at 
3:30 p.m., the Wolverines won’t 
know what they’re playing for 
until long after their game is over. 
But Bolden says the absence of 
a win-and-you’re-in guarantee 
won’t affect his team’s mindset 
throughout the week.

“It could be at stake, so why not 

prepare for it?” Bolden said.

Realistically, most of the team 

doesn’t need a championship on 
the line to get fired up for Ohio 
State. Michigan hasn’t beaten the 
Buckeyes in the last three years. 

There are seniors who have never 
beaten them.

So even if “The Game” amounts 

to nothing but pride, a win wouldn’t 
mean any less to the Wolverines.

For players like junior tight 

end 
Jake 
Butt, 
who 
grew 

up just outside Columbus in 
Pickerington, Ohio, and junior 
cornerback Jourdan Lewis, who 
went to Detroit Cass Tech — a 
high school heavily recruited by 
both universities — the rivalry has 
some additional dimensions.

“Honestly, (Cass Tech head 

coach Thomas) Wilcher is a 
Michigan guy,” Lewis said. “So we 
(are) always Michigan guys. Just a 
few guys stray going to Ohio State. 
But honestly, it’s a Michigan thing 
there.”

Eight Cass Tech alumni will 

be on the rosters for the game: 
three for Ohio State and five 
for Michigan. And with former 
teammates facing off, banter is a 
given.

“We haven’t really talked 

about it yet, but I’m pretty sure 
we’ll get into it later in the week,” 
Lewis said.

As 
for 
Butt, 
childhood 

memories make a chance to play in 
the rivalry even more special. Butt 
specifically 
recalled 
watching 

the 2006 “Game of the Century,” 
which the Buckeyes won, 42-39.

“I grew up around that rivalry 

— friends were Ohio State fans, 
had friends that were Michigan 
fans — and it would always just be 
such a huge event and something 
you look forward to right after 
Thanksgiving,” Butt said. “It’s 
really special to play in that game. 
Growing up around that rivalry, 
it’s something I always dreamt of 
playing in some day.”

Ohio State never offered Butt, 

but on Saturday, he’ll have his 
third chance to beat the Buckeyes. 
Getting his team to the Big Ten 
Championship game would be 
gravy on top.

Harbaugh sticks 
to routine ahead 
of rivalry battle

Wolverines avoid 

putting extra 
attention on 

Saturday’s game

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

Among all his eccentricities, 

quips and sideline meltdowns, 
Michigan football coach Jim 
Harbaugh is nothing if not a 
man of routine. He wears the 
same outfit daily, he constantly 
preaches 
hard 
work, 
and 

his intensity hardly wavers, 
whether he’s in the middle 
of coaching a game or if he’s 
conducting a press conference.

But if there were ever a time 

for Harbaugh to stray from his 
routine, it would be this week, 
when he prepares to lead the 
Michigan football team against 
Ohio State for the first time.

The 
rivalry 
is 
personal 

to 
Harbaugh. 
He 
famously 

guaranteed a victory for the 
Wolverines over the Buckeyes 
during the final year of his 
playing career in 1986, and his 
college coach, Bo Schembechler, 
was known for the intensity with 
which he treated the rivalry.

But during his weekly press 

conference Monday, Harbaugh 
held true to form. He made no 
guarantees, predictions or broad 
statements about the importance 
of the upcoming rivalry game.

In his mind, it’s just another 

game. When asked if he was 
looking 
forward 
to 

Saturday’s 
game, 
Harbaugh 
replied that he 
was primarily 
looking 
forward 
to 

meeting 
with 

his 
team 
to 

begin 
game 

preparation. 
His philosophy won’t change.

“You know exactly how we go 

about things,” Harbaugh said. 
“We’ve been trying to be better 
today than we were yesterday. 
We’re 
trying 
to 
be 
better 

tomorrow than we were today.”

Matching up with Ohio State 

will not be a simple task. Before 
the Buckeyes lost to Michigan 
State on Saturday, they had won 
23 games in a row, including a 
national championship.

Ohio 
State 
coach 
Urban 

Meyer provides Harbaugh an 
elite adversary. Last season’s 
national title was his third. 
The stature of the two coaches 
within the college game has 
brought 
about 
numerous 

comparisons 
regarding 
the 

possibility of the Harbaugh-
Meyer rivalry matching the one 
Schembechler had with former 
Ohio State coach Woody Hayes 
in the 1970s.

Harbaugh isn’t buying into 

the storyline.

“My reaction to the coach-

versus-coach buildup is he’s not 
going to be blocking anybody,” 
Harbaugh said. “He’s not going 
to be tackling anybody. I’m 
going to be over there standing 
on the sidelines blocking and 
tackling nobody.”

Harbaugh did take a moment 

to reflect upon one of the battles 
between his mentor and Hayes. 
When he saw the snow on the 
ground in Ann Arbor on Monday, 
he thought about the anticipation 
leading up to the first game 
between 
Schembechler 
and 

Hayes in 1969. Harbaugh was 
just 5 years old at the time, but 
Schembechler’s former players 
have told him the story.

The Monday before that game 

— in which the Wolverines were 
heavy underdogs against a top-
ranked Ohio State team, only 
to later pull off a historic upset 
— Michigan’s practice field was 
covered in snow. Schembechler, 
the story goes, handed his 
players shovels and made them 
clear the field.

Harbaugh did not offer many 

memories of his own playing 
career against the Buckeyes. 
When asked about his famous 
guarantee, 
he 
says 
that 
it 

happened a long time ago, that he 
wouldn’t do something like that 
now. As a coach, Ohio State is just 
another foe.

Harbaugh’s 
players 

understand how he sees things. 
He has told his players all 
along that if they ratchet up the 
intensity during one week of 
practice for a specific opponent, 
it just means that they weren’t 

giving 
their 

all 
during 

another.

“(He’ll 

approach 
it) 

the same way 
he approaches 
every 
week, 

with a lot of 
enthusiasm 
unknown 
to 

mankind,” 
said redshirt 

junior 
defensive 
end 
Willie 

Henry.

Henry 
and 
many 
of 
his 

teammates from Ohio differ 
from Harbaugh in that they 
believe this game is more special 
than the average one. They 
won’t do anything differently 
to prepare, but the game has a 
different feel. Their friends and 
former teammates are Ohio State 
fans, and they hear about the 
rivalry whenever they go home, 
and even when they’re in Ann 
Arbor. They consider the rivalry 
to be the greatest one in all of 
sports, and now they’re looking 
to help lead Michigan to a victory 
against the Buckeyes for just the 
second time in 12 years.

That 
historical 
aspect 

isn’t particularly relevant to 
Harbaugh. All he cares about is 
the week in front of him.

“Our plan every week is 

ceaseless and intense,” Harbaugh 
said. “Never slackening. Always 
continuing at the same intense, 
demanding, punishing level.”

Jim Harbaugh said he will treat this week like any other, despite the rivalry.

“Our plan every 
week is ceaseless 

and intense. 

Never slackening.”

Finn reflects on barefoot finish 
at second career national meet

Junior ran last 

two-thirds of race 

without shoes, 
finished 19th

By SYLVANNA GROSS

Daily Sports Writer

Junior Erin Finn made sure 

to triple-knot her shoes before 
the 6,000-meter course at the 
NCAA Women’s Cross Country 
Championships in Louisville, 
Ky. 

She had lost her spikes in a 

race before during her Michigan 
career. That time, her coach, 
Mike McGuire, told her to drop 
out. But this was the national 
meet. Dropping out was not an 
option. 

As Finn took off from the 

starting 
gun, 
she 
quickly 

positioned herself in the leading 
pack of the 254 athletes. She 
paced herself and only made 
moves in reaction to others. Finn 
was running smart. 

At the 2,000-meter mark, 

however, Finn lost her spikes 
after being clipped in the ankles 
by a runner behind her.

A few more feet, and she lost 

the other shoe, too. Finn was left 
in her socks.

“For maybe a millisecond, 

one of the choices I had was to 
give up,” Finn said. “I could have 
quit, I could have gone back to 
get more shoes, or I could have 
just kept going. But I didn’t 
consider anything else. I went 
forward. My teammates were 
relying on me. And I knew it was 
going to hurt just as much on the 
inside to quit compared to the 
pain running barefoot.” 

Fifty meters after losing her 

shoes, Finn lost her socks.

Yet 4,000 meters later — at 

the finish line — Finn became 
one of just seven Wolverines in 
program history to become a 
two-time All-American, placing 
19th with a time of 20:10.2.

And she did it barefoot. 

To put it in perspective, if 

this had been any other course, 
it wouldn’t have been that much 
of an issue. Most cross country 
meets are held on golf courses 
where the grass is kept and 
the ground is soft. However, 
Louisville’s course is held at 
Tom Sawyer State Park, where 
there are sections on gravel and 
over pine cone-covered grass. 
The course definitely was not 
“conducive to barefoot running.”

“I don’t think during the race 

anyone realized I was barefoot,” 
Finn said. “But there’s a long 
gravel straightaway with a tiny 
bit of grass on the side. So when 
I got there, I was staying to the 
side. But (McGuire) was there, 
and he was yelling at me to get on 
the gravel. But then our graduate 
assistant coach noticed my feet 
and told him. (McGuire’s) face 
just dropped.

“I was a little annoyed when 

he said to get on the gravel before 
he knew. I was like, ‘Are you 
kidding?’ I was almost trying to 
avoid him the entire time before 
then because I didn’t want him 
to tell me to drop out. I couldn’t 
drop out.” 

Despite 
her 
dedicated 

performance, Finn only felt 
frustrated when she finished. 
She had been so focused on 
running and dealing with the 
pain that she didn’t think she had 
even finished 
in the top 40.

And after a 

stellar season 
in which she 
won 
three 

regular-
season meets 
and 
claimed 

the individual 
title 
at 
the 

Big 
Ten 

Championship 
— becoming just the second 
Wolverine ever to claim the title 
twice — Finn wanted to win. 

“I 
was 
extraordinarily 

frustrated,” Finn said. “I was 
shooting for a top-10 finish. I was 
really angry and in a lot of pain. 

I was questioning why this had 
to happen. I didn’t think I was as 
high up as I was. As time went on 
and I talked to my coach, mom 
and teammates, that’s when I 
found out I was All-American. 
I still wanted to be higher, 

but 
they 
all 

made me feel 
proud that I 
continued 
to 

fight.” 

After 
her 

race 
Finn’s 

phone 
was 

flooded 
with 

texts 
and 

calls 
from 

her 
former 

teammates, 

coaches and friends. All of them 
were telling her how proud they 
were of her. It was the only 
thing that made Finn shift her 
perspective. 

“There was nothing in me that 

wanted to learn anything out of 

this,” Finn said. “I just received 
so much support, and that’s 
what made me realize I can fight 
through hard times. And I have 
and I will continue to do so. 
McGuire said that it was one of 
the toughest performances he’s 
ever seen — and he’s coached so 
many great athletes. He doesn’t 
compliment that often, so when 
it happens, it means a lot.” 

The No. 6 Michigan team 

finished in sixth place, led by the 
barefooted Finn. 

Despite 
everything, 
Finn 

doesn’t hold a grudge against 
the girl who clipped her because 
Finn knows it wasn’t on purpose. 
Rather, she recognizes that what 
happened is the “name of the 
game.” 

Though, half-jokingly, Finn 

would like that girl to walk a 
mile in her shoes. 

Or, rather, run 4,000 meters 

barefoot 
over 
gravel 
and 

pinecones.

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Erin Finn ran what her coach called one of the toughest races he had seen.

“It was going 
to hurt just as 
much on the 
inside to quit.”

GRANT HARDY/Daily

Senior linebacker Joe Bolden, who grew up in Ohio, will play Ohio State for the final time on Saturday. Both teams are still alive in the Big Ten title race.
