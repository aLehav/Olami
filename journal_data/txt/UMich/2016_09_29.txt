According 
to 
a 
recent 

Michigan 
Daily 
poll 
of 
a 

sample of students, support 
for 
Democratic 
presidential 

nominee Hillary Clinton on 
campus is high, at almost 75 
percent. 
However, 
the 
poll 

also indicated that nearly 20 
percent of respondents plan to 
vote outside of the two major 
parties, preferring third-party 
candidates.

Among 
the 
third 
party 

candidates, 
Liberterian 

nominee 
Gary 
Johnson, 

who polled at 13.2 percent, 
garnered the most support. 
The Libertarian nominee’s poll 
share was also greater than 
that of Republican nominee 
Donald Trump, who received 
approximately half of that at 5.9 
percent. Green Party nominee 
Jill Stein received 3.3 percent 
support in the poll, and 3.3 
percent said other.

Nationally, 
third 
parties 

have been seeing an increase 
in support compared to prior 
elections. 
The 
most 
recent 

RealClearPolitics 
polling 

average shows Johnson with 
8.3 percent of the vote and 
Green 
Party 
candidate 
Jill 

Stein at 2.7 percent. In contrast, 
in 
2012 
Johnson 
received 

approximately 3 percent of the 
vote and Stein 1 percent.

These increases have been 

seen 
several 
times 
before 

in 
presidential 
election 

history, most notably in 1992, 
when 
independent 
Texas 

businessman Ross Perot pulled 
support from both incumbent 
Republican President George H. 
W. Bush and Democratic then-
Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton. 
Perot ultimately got 18.9 percent 
of the national vote.

This movement toward third 

parties on campus specifically 
also comes at a time of increasing 

importance for both the Trump 
and Clinton campaigns, as both 
millennial voters and the state 
of Michigan will be key factors 
in November.

Based 
on 
the 

RealClearPolitics 
polling 

average, the race in Michigan 
between Trump and Clinton 
is currently the closest it has 
been since July, though Clinton 
currently maintains a lead of 4.7 

points in the battleground state.

However, Political Science 

Prof. Vincent Hutchings noted 
that Clinton will still likely win 
the state, even if third party 
support increased.

“It’s unlikely that Michigan 

would 
not 
vote 
for 
the 

Democratic nominee at this 
point,” he said. “Donald Trump, 
given 
his 
limited 
financial 

resources as a candidate, is not 

Students chalked the Diag 

early Wednesday morning with 
messages in solidarity with black 
students on campus including 
phrases like “Black Lives Matter” 
and “white silence is a violence.” 
The students also posted fliers in 
Mason and Angell Hall, which 
feature positive messages along 
the same theme.

The chalking follows two 

separate 
protests 
drawing 

hundreds of students Monday and 
Tuesday in response to racially 
charged 
fliers 
found 
posted 

throughout 
campus 
Monday 

morning and a debate hosted by 
the Michigan Political Union 
on the merits of the Black Lives 
Matter movement.

LSA senior Sean Smith, the 

organizer of the chalking event, 
said he wanted to remind the 
community about the issues faced 
by the Black community at the 
University and also remind Black 
students of their value.

“Not only are we saying that 

black lives matter but that we are 
valued at this university, that we 
worked just as hard as everybody 
else to get here,” he said. “We 
are writing positive words of 
affirmation to uplift black people 
and Black lives, all Black lives.”

Smith noted that he organized 

the chalking of the Diag to 
continue the efforts of Black 
women on campus who organized 
the initial protests this week. He 
said that this was an opportunity 
for Black men and working allies 
to contribute to this collective 
effort and keep the momentum 
going.

Community 
members 

gathered at the Tilden R. Stumbo 
Civic Center in Ypsilanti to hear 
Sheriff Jerry Clayton and other 
members of the Washtenaw 
County Sheriff’s Office speak 
on law enforcement policies 
and practices that are meant 
to encourage a fair [COPY: 
fair seems like a weird word 
to 
describe 
relationship] 

relationship between police and 
citizens.

Sheriff Clayton and other 

members of his staff talked 
about policies regarding subject 
control, or the guidelines that 
officers face when interacting 
with citizens when there is the 
potential of risk involved.

A 
focal 
point 
in 
subject 

control policy discussed was the 
regulations regarding the use of 
force. Clayton and Lieutenant 
Kurt 
Schiappacasse 
walked 

through the idea of subjective 
versus objective decision making 
in situations that may require the 
use of force, where officers are 
trained to judge situations based 
on what is logically reasonable,

The Michigan State House 

of 
Representatives 
passed 

a series of bills in a 100 to 6 
vote last Wednesday aimed 
at removing the protections 
that the state’s Freedom of 
Information 
Act 
currently 

offers to the governor’s office. 
The 10-bill package would also 
establish a new Legislative 
Open Records Act — a bill that 
closely mirrors FOIA — which 
would make records from the 
legislative branch available to 
the public.

Rep. 
Ed 
McBroom 
(R–

Vulcan), the sponsor of two of 
the bills, said the reforms were 
important in part because of an 
erosion of public confidence in 
government.

“I believe that our Freedom 

of Information Act should have 
been far more transparent 
from the very beginning when 
we passed the first act 40 years 
ago,” McBroom said. “It’s not 
like it is any more important 
to pass these bills now rather 
than 40 years ago. However,

POLICE ACCOUNTABILIT Y


The Wall Street Journal and 

Times Higher Education released 

their annual college rankings on 

Tuesday, naming the University 

of Michigan being ranked the 

number one public university in 

the country. 

This ranking is different from 

many traditional college rankings 

in that it places emphasis on 

factors other than the average 

test scores of incoming freshmen 

and how many students were 

rejected upon application. 

Instead, it’s based on four 

categories: student outcomes 

such as salary and job placement 

after graduation, school 

resources, how well the school 

engages with students and finally 

the learning environment, or 

diversity on campus. The ranking 

found the highly ranked schools 

were those that performed well 

in multiple categories.

The ranking also took into 

account more than 100,000 

student responses to a survey 

sent out by the Wall Street 

Journal and Times Higher 

Education, asking questions 

on students’ interactions with 

professors, if they thought they 

were pushed to think critically 

and if they would recommend 

their school to prospective 

students. In a press release, The 

Wall Street Journal and Times 

Higher Education said they also 

consider their ranking unique 

because it focuses on how much 

a college spends on classroom 

instruction, awarding a higher 

ranking to those schools that 

place an emphasis on teaching 

and research excellence.

The University, while the 

top-ranked public university, 

came in at number 24 in the 

overall ranking. The other 

public institutions that ranked 

among the top 100 included 

University of California, Los 

Angeles and University of 

California, Berkeley.

The University was also 

ranked as the best public 

university earlier this month by 

QS World University Rankings 

and number 23 overall. The 

only other public university 

to make the top 50 in the 

QS rankings was University 

of California, Los Angeles at 

number 31.

For many, keeping a car in 

Ann Arbor as a student can be 
difficult, because parking is in 
such high demand. Maven, a new 
car sharing company, is hoping to 
remedy this problem by making 
it easier for students to get to 
where they need to go and back 
affordably and quickly. 

The company, launched in 

January as a subsidiary of General 
Motors, joins other car services 
such as ZipCar which allows 
people to rent cars. Like ZipCar, 
users use an app on their phone 
to locate, reserve and unlock 
vehicles and then pay based on the 
half hour. Ann Arbor, along with 
New York City, Boston, Chicago 
and Washington D.C., is one of 
five offices opened within their 

first nine months of operation. 
GM spokesman Stefan Cross said 
the move to go into car-sharing 
was all about expanding into 
different forms of transportation.

“The goal from a GM standpoint 

is to expand into alternate modes 
of transportation,” Cross said. 
“So we figured, to stay relevant, 
we have to get into different types 
of transportation.”

Speaking to why Maven chose 

the University as one of its first 
locations, Cross said with such 
a large campus there is a need 
for ways to get places not so 
conveniently located, and noted 
how keeping a car as a student 
in Ann Arbor can sometimes be 
a challenge due to limited space 
and cost. He also said Maven 
was drawn to the city because 
of its openness to new ideas and 
services, both as a community 
and University.

“Ann Arbor — the community 

and the University — has really 
shown a willingness to adapt to 
new modes of transportation,” 
Cross said. “We thought Ann 
Arbor is a very progressive market 
that could use and would adapt to 
a car sharing service.”

Engineering 
sophomore 

Nicholas 
Martin 
said 
he 

downloaded Maven last year after 
reading about their program in 
January. He said it’s beneficial for 
going out for food late at night and 
going to the grocery store.

“I have used it five times on 

campus,” Martin said. “I used it to 
drive to late night food off campus 
and once to Meijer.”

Ann Arbor has 20 locations 

to pick-up and drop-off cars for 
Maven, spanning from downtown 
Ann Arbor to the University’s 
North Campus, as well as out to 
I-94 and M-14.

ON THE DAILY: UNIVERSITY RANKS FIRST IN WSJ POLL

I do think that since it wasn’t 
done then it has been part 
of the growing mistrust in 
government.”

Public 
transparency 
has 

been a significant, ongoing 
issue in Michigan for several 
years. In a 2015 study done 
by the nonprofit organization 
Center for Public Integrity, the 
state ranked last in the country 
for executive, legislative and 
judicial accountability.

According to the Center 

for 
Public 
Integrity, 
this 

was partially because of the 
numerous 
protections 
that 

the state FOIA laws currently 
provide to the judicial branch, 
as well as the protections 
provided 
to 
the 
executive 

branch.

The 10 bill package passed 

Wednesday contains two bills 
— HB 5469 and HB 5470 — 
which specifically amend the 
current FOIA law to address 
the issue of transparency for 
the executive branch, and eight 
bills that establish and define 
LORA. 

“The last two bills remove 

the 
exemptions 
that 
the 

governor has had under the 
Freedom of Information Act,” 
McBroom said. “While it still 
provides for a few exemptions, 
this is a big change for the 
governor’s office, and brings 
Michigan in line with most 
other states.”

Currently, 
the 
governor’s 

office is exempt from FOIA, 
which means that they do 
not have to release records 
to 
the 
public. 
Under 
the 

bills, the exemptions would 

remain in place only for 

documents that are for judicial 
appointments, 
prepared 

remarks to the state House of 
Representatives, pardons and 
state budgets.

McBroom said in addition 

to providing great protection 
to the governor, Michigan’s 
FOIA law was also ineffective 
at making documents from 
the legislature available to the 
public, which is why LORA 
is also a part of the package. 
Currently, the legislature is 
also exempt from FOIA.

“The other eight bills in 

the package create a new 
act — called the Legislative 
Open Records Act,” McBroom 
said. “LORA closely follows 
FOIA; however, it is specific 
only to the legislature, which 
is something that we think 
is very important. We need 
transparency and more open 

records in this branch of our 
government.”

LORA, like FOIA, would be 

managed by coordinators that 
would oversee records requests 
at the same cost as FOIA 
requests, and will only apply to 
records after Jan. 1, 2017.

McBroom 
said 
the 
bill 

package has received much 
bipartisan 
support 
in 
the 

House, and is expected to be 
reviewed by the state senate by 
November.

“In the past, it was usually 

the minority party that talked 
about reforming FOIA, but it 
never got done,” McBroom said. 
“About a year ago, we decided 
that it was time to get serious 
about this bipartisan issue, and 
after much hard work we are 
confident that these bills will 
accomplish the reform we have 
long wanted to see.”

rather than what they personally 
perceive to be circumstances 
requiring the use of force.

Implicit racial bias within 

officers and law enforcement 
organizations was a recurring 
theme highlighted by questions 
put forth by members of the 
audience. Clayton noted these 
biases 
are 
major 
barriers 

between 
improving 
trust 

between police and citizens.

“That’s a major part of what 

is wrong with the relationship 
between the community and 
the police department,” Clayton 
said. “It’s the perception of 
unfairness and bias in terms 
of how police officers handle 
their business, how they are 
investigated and that a person in 
the street doesn’t have a chance.”

The presenters also discussed 

the challenges behind addressing 
biases. Clayton noted internal 
biases as problems that cannot 
be addressed with legislation.

“This really is a personal issue 

because we all have implicit bias, 
it’s just whether you recognize 
what they are and whether you 
are willing to admit that you 
have them, and if you understand 
the fact that implicit bias have an 
influence on the decisions that 
you make and the actions that 
you take,” he said. “I think our 
profession is behind because 
we get defensive about these 

things.”

Brian 
Miller, 
a 
special 

investigator 
and 
internal 

investigations expert with the 
sheriff’s office [COPY: can only 
confirm 
special 
investigator 

part], spoke on the importance 
of 
internal 
affairs 
policy 

as a means of holding law 
enforcement offices accountable 
to the public. John Hudson, a 
Superior 
Township 
resident 

and coordinator of his local 
neighborhood watch, said he 
attended the presentation to 
gain information that he would 
be able to take home and put to 
use in his community.

“I didn’t come expecting 

anything specific; I wanted to 
hear how they would address it. I 
think they are doing a good job,” 
he said. “I’d rather hear about 
what’s going on than any kind of 
political things.”

Clayton noted to the Daily 

that he was surprised by the 
lack of youth present at the 
presentation. The vast majority 
of people in attendance were 
older community members.

“We are going to create the 

space for the conversation, and 
we are going to try to provide the 
information and be as open as 
we can, but it is incumbent now 
upon the community to come in 
and be part of it.”

The sheriff’s office has another 

session planned in two weeks in 
Dexter to continue the dialogue 
between law enforcement and 
the 
community, 
specifically 

focusing on new training policies 
and issues with the corrections 
system.

Joan Martin,[COPY: only sort 

of confirmed] another Superior 
Township resident, told the 
Daily she was satisfied with 
the information covered by the 
sheriff and his staff, noting that 
she thought they did a good 
job answering the questions 
that they were answered. She 
said that there should be a 
greater emphasis on how law 
enforcement alone can’t solve 
relations issues.

“One thing I think needs to 

be stressed — I kept hearing the 
sheriff saying, ‘We are reaching 
out to the community, but we 
can’t handle everything and we 
are looking for the community to 
reach back and to do their part.’ 
I would like to see if we don’t 
have a community that we can 
do that,” she said. “I think the 
sheriff has started something 
that the community needs to 
respond to.”

During 
the 
presentation, 

Clayton touched on this and 
mentioned that citizens play 
an equally important role in 
rebuilding 
the 
relationship 

between police and citizens.

“Quite frankly, while law 

enforcement is oftentimes the 
one called, we need to stop 
saying that we can solve all the 
problems. These aren’t just law 
enforcement issues, but also 
community challenges,” he said.

going to be putting a lot of effort 
in the state because the chances 
are going to pretty low for him to 
win it.”

In interviews, students at 

the University cited a diverse 
array of reasons for voting third 
party, with one common theme 
— frustration at the choices 
presented to them in the election.

Engineering junior Andrew 

Hoffman, who is voting for 
Johnson, said he is voting 
third party because he believes 
Johnson best represents his own 
values.

For Hoffman, those values 

include a small government, 
experience and trustworthiness. 
He said he wants a candidate 
who he believes will actually 
fulfill the campaign promises he 
or she makes, which he does not 
see in either Trump or Clinton. 
He also said he takes issue with 
both candidates on an individual 
level.

“Trump is an authoritarian 

demagogue,” Hoffman said. “He 
has basically spoken the opposite 
way I feel on almost every issue. 
The biggest thing with Hillary 
Clinton is that I don’t trust 
her. She is the epitome of the 
establishment. I’ve disagreed 
with everything she’s done in the 
past several years.”

On 
another 
side 
of 
the 

political spectrum, supporters of 
Green Party nominee Jill Stein 
expressed similar feelings, citing 
a lack of representation among 
the two party candidates, though 
their opinions differed on which 
issues were most important to 
them.

University 
alum 
Michael 

Chrzan 
said 
though 
he 
is 

registered as a Democrat, he 
currently supports the Green 
Party because he feels the other 
candidate options do not share 
his values.

“As of right now I do not feel 

like either of the two major 
parties have my interests as a 

citizen as their top priorities,” 
he said. “They aren’t necessarily 
concerned with addressing the 
concerns that I have with the 
parties.”

For Chrzan, the largest factors 

influencing his vote are economic 
policy, social issues and foreign 
policy. The Green Party platform 
is based on 10 key values overall, 
including grassroots democracy, 
social justice and ecological 
wisdom.

Eric Borregard, a candidate 

for state representative for the 
Green Party in the 52nd District 
which 
includes 
Ann 
Arbor, 

said he hopes to alter the way 
the political system runs and 
believes the Green Party is the 
best way to do so.

“I’m very concerned about the 

future,” he said. “I care about the 
environment deeply, and I think 
(Green Party candidates) are 
the best choice if you care about 
those things. They will attempt 
to change things, whereas the 
other parties are not about 
change.”

For 
Democrats 
and 

Republicans on campus, the 
sentiment toward third-party 
voters is mixed.

LSA junior Collin Kelly, chair 

of the University’s chapter of 
College Democrats, wrote in an 
email interview that he thinks 
voting for a third party candidate 
will aid a Trump victory and 
stop 
a 
incredibly 
qualified, 

progressive 
Democratic 

candidate.

“In the two party system of 

American politics, third party 
candidates 
realistically 
can 

do little more than take votes 
from the two major parties,” 
he wrote. “Any vote for Stein or 
Johnson is ostensibly a vote for 
a Donald Trump. As the New 
York Times mentioned in their 
recent endorsement of Clinton, 
this election can’t just be a 
vote against Trump - votes for 
Johnson and Stein would check 
that box — but we need people to 
vote for Clinton.”

In 
an 
email 
interview, 

LSA junior Enrique Zalamea, 

president of the University’s 
chapter of College Republicans, 
echoed Kelly’s sentiment that 
third party votes would aid 
Trump, but wrote that he sees it 
as a positive impact.

“According to (Real Clear 

Politics) 
national 
polling 

averages, third party candidates 
will 
actually 
improve 
the 

possibility of a Trump victory,” 
he 
wrote. 
“This 
increased 

probability 
is 
even 
more 

apparent when looking at swing 
states, such as Ohio that goes 
from a +1.8 Trump lead in a two-
way race to a +2.5 lead in a four-
way race.”

However, 
students 
voting 

third party said they saw Kelly 
and Zalamea’s perspectives as 
an unfair assessment of their 
choices, noting that though they 
understand their sentiment, they 
cannot bring themselves to vote 
for Clinton or Trump.

Chrzan 
said 
though 
he 

understands 
why 
there 
is 

concern about pulling votes 
from the two major parties, he 
believes the basic principles of 
democracy support his right to 
vote for the candidate who best 
represents his interests.

“I think the emotions behind 

the concerns are very valid,” he 
said. “I don’t think the framing 
of them as a vote for one of the 
other candidates is a really 
logical argument. I’m not casting 
my vote for that person. I’m 
casting my vote for a third party 
because that person best fits 
what I want. It’s the precedent of 
democracy.”

Hoffman 
echoed 
his 

sentiments, saying he doesn’t 
believe he should have to choose 
between 
two 
unappealing 

candidates.

“It 
is 
really 
completely 

lacking understanding of how 
the American electorate system 
works,” he said. “I understand 
their line of thinking, but in 
reality — and especially in this 
election — I think both major 
candidates are dumpster fires, 
and I’m not going to choose the 
less burning dumpster fire.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Jackson 

Dumas said in an interview with 
the Daily he is excited to spend 
time at the IM Building after the 
recent renovations.

“I’m absolutely excited, 100 

percent stoked,” Dumas said. “It’s 
a great facility, great people. Just a 
fun place to be.”

Prior 
to 
Wednesday, 
the 

University’s Recreational Sports 
Department had been actively 
campaigning for the reopening 
on their Twitter page, frequently 
posting photos highlighting the 
improvements to the building and 
new equipment.

The IM Building is one of 

three workout facilities available 
to students and University staff, 
alongside the North Campus 
Recreational Building and the 
Central 
Campus 
Recreational 

Building, which will also be 
renovated. The CCRB opened 
in 1976 and lacks many of the 
new features now included in 
the IM Building — including air 
conditioning and social lounges.

LSA junior Hannah Jo Maier, 

who works at the IM Building, 
said she is excited for her fellow 
students to see what the new 
building has to offer.

“We just officially opened today. 

It’s been hectic but nice, being able 
to show people this $21 million 
building,” she said. “I think we’ll 
get a lot more people than the 
CCRB (with the new renovations).”

“Black women have labored 

so much, not just this week, but 
throughout history (in regards to 
organizing),” Smith wrote to the 
Daily. “I felt like it was our turn to 
carry the baton, especially Black 
men, and support them like they 
suppport us. People forget that the 
Montgomery Bus Boycott lasted 
for 381 days; it’s about sustained 
effort. And that effort shouldn’t be 
left up to a few.”

Smith added that the group 

is using excerpts from Langston 
Hughes’ poem “I too” to serve 
as a reminder of the historical 
significance of racial prejudice in 

the United States.

The students spent several 

hours chalking and flyering after 
gathering earlier in the night. 
The message and idea was spread 
through word of mouth through 
friend and acquaintances after 
the initial request for help from 
anyone available. 

LSA junior Justin Gordon 

pointed to his chalk phrase, “Black 
love is inclusive.” Looking at the 
dozen 
identities 
surrounding 

him at 2:00 am, he embraced the 
diverse range of individuals who 
were participating in the chalking. 
Gordon emphasized that no one is 
excluded in the Black Lives Matter 
movement.

“I want people to understand 

and witness the demographic 

of who was out here right now,” 
Gordon said. “I’m looking at 
white people; I’m looking at queer, 
transgender, Asian, Arab, Muslim, 
Black — everybody’s out here.”

Gordon said that as people begin 

to understand that this is a human 
issue, globally, the movement will 
continue to gain momentum.

“When 
you 
have 
global, 

human 
issues, 
humans 
from 

across the globe pitch in, so that’s 
the importance of this,” Gordon 
said. “That’s what makes this so 
powerful and alive and so jazzy, 
because we’re all here, we’re all 
here standing together.”

“That’s at the core of it all is just 

supporting and loving one another 
on a personal level.”

T

wenty-three. This year a 
75-year-old 
democratic 

socialist won 23 states 

in a presidential primary, and 
America was astounded. How 
could a man preaching a form of 
socialism achieve even 
close to this amount of 
success in a country 
that prides itself on 
being the epicenter 
of 
capitalism? 
A 

democratic 
socialist 

as 
president? 
The 

concept 
seems 

blasphemous.

Capitalism 
is 

a 
deep-seated 

American institution, 
and 
as 
a 
result, 

much of the nation shares a 
feeling 
of 
antipathy 
toward 

non-capitalist 
philosophies, 

including democratic socialism. 
But does the vast majority of our 
population even know what a 
democratic socialist is? To many, 
the term was heard for the first 
time during this election cycle, 
and since then it has been thrown 
around constantly without a 
concrete definition.

We are certainly not strangers 

to the term “democratic,” and 
our media has made sure that 
we’ve become familiar with 
some concept of socialism over 
the years, virtually turning 
it into a political swear word 
since the rise of the Soviet 
Union. I can’t help but wonder: 
What happens when you mix 
these two concepts together? Is 
democratic socialism the same 
thing as the supposed socialist 
boogeyman that we’ve heard 
so much about? Should our 
leaders be concerned that the 
proletariat masses will soon be 
up in arms?

According to Lisa Disch, the 

director of graduate studies in 
political science and a professor 
of political theory here at the 
University of Michigan, not 
exactly.

“I don’t think that much of 

what 
passes 
for 
democratic 

socialism today in the U.S. has 
much of a relationship to Karl 
Marx, except for the fact that 
Bernie Sanders is an unabashed 
user of the term ‘class,’ ” she 
said in an interview with The 
Michigan Daily. “Democrats or 
Republicans think of America as 
a pluralist society, which means 
that we are a society made up 
of many different competing 
groups whose memberships can 
overlap,” she continued. “Nobody 
overlaps between being a member 
of the middle class or the elite … 
It’s a more divisive way of looking 
at our society.”

So, one of the primary ways to 

classify democratic socialism is 
by its belief that distinct social 
classes exist in our country, 
but that doesn’t seem like such 
a radical idea in itself. From 
the way it’s portrayed in the 

media, 
there 
has 

to be more to the 
story; 
democratic 

socialists still want 
to 
overthrow 
our 

society and plunge 
us into chaos, right?

According to Disch, 

Sanders is no Marxist. 
He’s not looking for 
an overthrow of the 
capitalist system, but 
rather a move toward 
social policies from 

the New Deal. Well, there goes 
my dream of a proletarian utopia. 

While a political renewal 

may not have the same visceral 
impact as a political revolution, 
this point does raise some 
interesting 
questions. 
First 

and foremost, is democratic 
socialism truly a new concept in 
mainstream American politics, 
or is it simply a rebranding 
of older ideas? On further 
examination, it seems that the 
answer may be the latter. 

In 1932, Franklin Roosevelt 

was elected to be the 32nd 
president of the United States, 
ushered in by a wave of support 
for his promise of a New Deal for 
the American people. Roosevelt 
thought the government had a 
duty to stimulate the economy 
and provide for its citizens; 
he 
stressed 
the 
need 
for 

environmental 
conservation, 

lamented the greed of Wall 
Street bankers and promised to 
put people to work by improving 
our 
nation’s 
infrastructure. 

It may seem that I’m simply 
reading from the Bernie Sanders 
debate playbook by rattling off 
these talking points, but rather, it 
appears that the basic principles 
of 
Roosevelt 
and 
Sanders’ 

platforms mirror each other, and 
this certainly comes through in 
their orations.

In 
his 
second 
inaugural 

address in 1937, Roosevelt stated: 

In this nation I see tens of 

millions of its citizens, a substantial 
part of its whole population, who 
at this very moment are denied 
the greater part of what the very 
lowest standards of today call the 
necessities of life. I see millions of 
families trying to live on incomes 
so meager that the pall of family 
disaster hangs over them day 
by day … I see millions denied 
education, recreation, and the 
opportunity to better their lot and 
the lot of their children … The test 
of our progress is not whether we 
add more to the abundance of those 

who have much; it is whether we 
provide enough for those who have 
too little.

This 
concept 
of 
helping 

the downtrodden reads like a 
page taken straight from Sen. 
Sanders’s stump speeches, and 
was the basic premise behind 
many of FDR’s policies.

With this in mind, it is 

important to note that Bernie 
Sanders is not preaching a 
foreign concept to American 
citizens. 
Rather, 
his 
ideas 

are reminiscent of those that 
allowed the Democratic Party 
to hold the White House 20 
years in a row starting with the 
election of Roosevelt.

The parallels are clear, as 

throughout 
his 
four 
terms 

as 
president, 
FDR 
greatly 

expanded 
the 
role 
of 
the 

government and created social 
welfare programs that remain 
American institutions to this 
day. Yet, the honest truth is 
that programs such as Social 
Security and the CCC would 
have been declared dead on 
arrival in our era of nonstop 
media coverage, the label of 
socialism dooming them before 
they were even considered.

This is the dilemma that 

Sanders faces, as the title of 
democratic socialism seems to 
have blinded the media to the 
precedent 
of 
the 
large-scale 

social programs that he has 
proposed. Rather than look back 
on history, we are content to deem 
his proposals idealistic fantasies 
instead of concrete policies, a 
temptation that we must resist. 
While ideas such as free college 
tuition for all may sound lofty and 
unattainable to some, the same 
could certainly be said about a 
program that would provide a 
livable income for generations of 
our nation’s retirees when Social 
Security was first passed nearly a 
century ago.

This is not an endorsement of 

democratic socialism, but rather 
a public service announcement 
of sorts. We as Americans 
need to resist the temptation 
to dismiss something simply 
because we do not understand 
it. We are often blinded by 
our prejudices when words 
such as socialism are thrown 
around, and it should be a goal 
of all Americans to never reject 
something merely out of a lack 
of understanding, because with 
a little context, even something 
as unfamiliar as democratic 
socialism may not seem so 
radical after all.

I 

am, and always have been, a 
proud Democrat. As a young 
Black 
male, 
I 
attribute 

this 
loyalty 
to 
the 
party’s 

commitment to diversity and 
inclusion. Democrats — unlike 
their counterparts on the right 
— seem much less 
hostile 
and 
more 

inviting to people 
from all walks of 
life, even if they look 
different, pray to a 
different god or have 
less money.

These 
ideals 

were 
constantly 

emphasized during 
Monday 
night’s 

presidential debates. 
Democratic nominee Hillary 
Clinton recounted the many 
times she heard constituents’ 
struggles, often due at least in 
part to their race, religion or 
any other characteristic that 
separates and ostracizes them 
from the citizens of middle-
class, white America. Speakers 
delivered 
similar 
messages 

at the Democratic National 
Convention this summer in 
Philadelphia, 
which 
I 
was 

fortunate enough to attend. 
However, despite the party’s 
focus on inclusivity, I found it 
cold and unwelcoming for non-
elites such as myself.

On my first morning at the 

convention, I was in awe at the 
hordes of police officers and 
Secret Service members guarding 
the convention. While I recognize 
the need to secure the convention 
hall from dangerous threats, 
security’s 
constantly 
hassling 

convention-goers and citizens 
— from the subway station miles 
away to moving from room to 
room in the convention hall — 
seemed a bit excessive. To me, 
they crossed the line between 
securing the building and creating 

an unwelcoming environment; 
I couldn’t make a simple trip to 
the bathroom without having to 
verify my credentials. I couldn’t 
help but wonder that maybe if I 
looked different or I’d had more 
money, I wouldn’t have had to do 

that.

And even before I 

entered the convention 
hall, 
I 
experienced 

a 
decidedly 
classist 

event. The long line to 
get in was stretching 
outside the security 
tent, but with no other 
option than waiting 
in line, I stood in the 
July heat to check in. 
Finally, the line began 

dwindling down. However, as 
I reached the end of the line 
and 
approached 
the 
metal 

detector, I was pushed aside by 
a police officer accompanying a 
well-dressed, and presumably 
wealthy, couple. They skipped 
the lengthy line I had worked 
my way down, and walked 
straight through security and 
onto a special DNC golf cart that 
whisked them away.

For the party of inclusivity, it 

sure did seem like you could buy 
your way to a better experience if 
you were privileged enough.

The rest of the convention felt 

the same, with special lounges 
and luxury boxes for some people 
but not for others. Everything 
down to the refreshments, which 
cost almost $5 for a bottle of 
water and more than $6 for a hot 
dog, served as a subtle reminder 
that the convention (and perhaps 
the party) was a space for the 
rich and powerful, not the 
everyday people most affected 
by the party’s decision — despite 
what the party leaders would 
have you believe.

As a proud Democrat, it feels 

wrong to say the only time I 

truly felt equal to my peers at the 
national convention was covering 
the protests outside. Everyone 
— rich and poor — was united 
in a common mission; everyone, 
from Jill Stein to just normal 
people like you and me, walked 
together in unity. In order to see 
the party they wanted to create, 
Democratic leaders simply had 
to look just beyond the wall of 
security personnel and fences 
they put up.

Now that the election is well 

underway, I’m left thinking: 
Am I making a mountain out of 
a molehill, or is this actually a 
reflection of how the Democratic 
Party 
operates? 
Are 
the 

Democrats really the party of 
inclusivity, as the spokespersons 
and nominee portray them to 
be, or is their top priority the 
livelihoods of the affluent, as the 
prices and “who’s who” feel of 
the DNC showed? Sadly for me, I 
don’t know the answer.

I do know, however, that this 

type of division is not what we 
need. While the short-term goal 
of the Democratic Party should 
be to defeat Donald Trump, the 
future of the Democratic Party 
— a party rooted in the ideals 
of equality — should aim to 
eliminate elitism from its ranks. 
It’s apparent that more people 
are becoming aware of the 
pitfalls of classism, as evidenced 
by the popularity of the Occupy 
protests and the success of 
more-liberal 
candidates 
and 

third parties. As this awakening 
continues to grow throughout 
the country, the future of the 
Democratic Party will only be 
secure when its practices match 
what it preaches.

D

ear family of the next 
Black man slain,

Instead 
of 
telling 

you sorry for your loss, I want 
to know what your son, father, 
cousin was like. 
What did he do 
for a living? How 
did he make you 
smile? What music 
did he listen to? 
Show 
me 
your 

favorite picture of 
him, not the one 
the news stations 
plaster. What was 
the last thing you 
said to him?

I’m 
sure 
you 

told him to be respectful when 
a cop approaches him. A mother 
should never fear for her child 
when interacting with those who 
protect and serve. Black men are 
told to keep their hoods down, 
their hands out of their pockets, 
their wallets on the dashboard, 
their mouths shut. But they’ve 
been killed for having a hood up, 
stalked for strolling with fingers 
dipping into blue jean pockets, 
murdered for a movement toward 
their license and registration, not 
a pistol, and had their mouths 
permanently closed by death. 

So many have been shot 

because of their dark complexion 
— each time, we say their names. 
We will say your son’s name, too. 
We will remember him forever. 
He will notw be relegated to a 
hashtag or a thought that lasts 
for just a few days. I will pray in 
response to his wrongful death; 
our protests will be productive 
and peaceful. As you know, 
rioting won’t solve anything, and 
that behavior only hinders the 
success we can have in getting 
more to empathize with this clear 
problem of police brutality. We 
will march. We will speak up. We 
will work toward change.

In this fight, know you are 

not alone. You have a nation of 
millions behind you. We will 
not rest until the violence stops. 
Continue to live as your loved 

one would like you to. I 
imagine some hate would 
be creeping in your heart 
toward whomever killed 
your son and toward 
the system — I can only 
imagine how much rage 
would fill me if my own 
father was murdered. 
Please take your time to 
grieve and rest. During 
that time, we will back 
you up, pouring out 
love and truth. We can 

even be filled with hate — it’s so 
difficult to get rid of. But I will 
work toward love, because it 
conquers all. As Martin Luther 
King Jr. once said, “Darkness 
cannot drive out darkness, only 
light can do that. Hate cannot 
drive out hate, only love can do 
that.”

But this hate has been strong, 

and double standards weigh 
heavy on our minds. The cop 
who shot your loved one will 
likely serve little time in jail, if 
any. If the tables were turned 
and the cop was the victim, the 
Black man would be serving 25 
to life. The system is broken, 
and the Black man is profiled, 
followed and deemed dangerous. 
But he was just in a perfectly 
normal place at a normal time, 
with the wrong cop, and dare I 
say, the wrong skin.

It’s terrible how the color 

of our skin reflects how we’re 
treated in this world, a problem 
that has existed since this 
country began. From plantations, 
to buses in Montgomery, to the 
streets of Flint and Baltimore, 
there’s 
a 
clear 
discrepancy. 

There are still people out there 
who don’t believe this is true 

or haven’t noticed. I hope that 
you will speak up when you are 
ready. Every voice matters, and 
your story is important.

For now, I’ll grieve with you. 

I won’t become desensitized 
to the deaths that happen far 
too often. I’ll pray for healing 
for your family and for God to 
answer your cries for justice. 
But I’m also angry, as I’m sure 
you are. I’m certain you’re 
tired from the violence, making 
unfortunate phone calls and not 
getting concrete answers. You’re 
probably weary from the tears 
and not being able to hug the man 
you loved dearly. I’m so sorry.

I know I can’t speak to all 

your emotions at this time. I 
fall short in emphasizing with 
you fully. This letter is one of 
the only things I can offer you. 
I don’t know if you’ll read it. I 
don’t know who you are and I 
didn’t know who I was writing 
to when I took my fingers to a 
keyboard. I just knew that sadly, 
another Black man would be 
slain in a street. Because that 
is commonplace in the United 
States of America in 2016. Some 
are angrier about a backup NFL 
quarterback kneeling for the 
national anthem than cold blood 
trickling down warm pavement. 
I’m pissed off and scared and 
weeping for the man who is 
dead. It didn’t have to happen 
again. You know that — you’ve 
been saying that. 

I’m at a loss for words. But 

my email will be listed at the 
bottom of this. If you read this, 
please reach out — I want to do 
something, I just don’t know 
what. We’ve never met, but I love 
you and I am with you.

Grace, peace and love,
Chris Crowder

Freshman tight end Devin Asiasi (2) made his first catch against Penn State on Saturday, a three-yard touchdown.
Asiasi settling in at Michigan

Devin Asiasi didn’t see his first 

Michigan touchdown coming. In 
fact, he wasn’t even supposed to 
get the ball on the play.

On 
3rd-and-goal 
from 
the 

3-yard line early in the second 
quarter, 
redshirt 
sophomore 

quarterback Wilton Speight was 
supposed to hit fifth-year senior 
wide 
receiver 
Jehu 
Chesson 

streaking toward the right pylon. 
Instead, he saw Asiasi sitting wide-
open down the middle of the field 
and immediately fired it to him for 
six points and the freshman tight 
end’s first catch of the season.

Chesson jokingly gave Asiasi 

grief for taking his touchdown 
after the play, but Asiasi was busy 
basking in the energy from the 
110,319 fans in attendance.

“I turned around, and I (saw) 

a bunch of people screaming,” 
Asiasi said. “I (saw) my teammate 
(senior tight end) Jake Butt right 
there, 
celebrated 
with 
him. 

I definitely took time to look 
around, enjoy the moment.”

The moment came out of 

nowhere for Asiasi, but it was 
something his coaches expected 
from him before he even arrived 
on campus. Tight ends coach 
Jay Harbaugh said he has had 
a good feeling about Asiasi ever 
since he watched film on him 
back in January.

“He plays fast. He’s physical,” 

Harbaugh said. “He’s capable of 
playing very nasty. He weighs 
somewhere around 270 pounds 
and still moves very, very well. 
It’s a rare physical combination. 
And then he has a good football 
awareness about him, and he 
learns well. Once I got a sense 
of the fact that he’d be able 
to pick things up fast enough 
to contribute, it was kind of a 
no-brainer that he’d be part of 
the group.”

Of course, it hasn’t hurt to have 

an All-American mentor like 
Butt in his position group. Asiasi 
calls Butt a “big brother,” and he 
hasn’t hesitated to ask questions 
about the offense or take small 
tips from the decorated senior. 
In fact, Asiasi credits Butt as the 
person who sold him on joining 
the Wolverines when he was still 
at Concord (Calif.) De La Salle 
High School.

As a result, Asiasi has found 

himself getting plenty of reps 
as the third tight end (behind 
Butt and redshirt sophomore 
Ian Bunting). Unlike his first 
touchdown, though, playing time 
didn’t come out of nowhere for 
Asiasi — he’s been expecting to 
play since he first committed.

“I came into the year with 

the mindset of me getting this 
playbook down and trying to 
make an impact my freshman 
year,” Asiasi said. “It’s not really 

a surprise to me.”

And even though he was 

used to being the biggest player 
on the field in high school, 
Asiasi hasn’t shown any signs 
of being intimidated by larger, 
older opponents in his first four 
college games. In fact, the biggest 
adjustment for him since coming 
to Michigan hasn’t occurred 
on the football field — it’s been 
familiarizing himself with the 
culture and expectations of Big 
Ten country.

Growing up in the Bay Area, 

Asiasi has never seen a university 
take football as seriously as 
Michigan. He’s also never seen 
snow before, a thought that 
makes him “kinda scared.”

“It’s 
crazy,” 
Asiasi 
said. 

“Coming from the West Coast, 
football’s not really (in) the 
spotlight. But over here, the 
football team here has a real big 
spotlight on them, so it’s crazy 
getting adjusted to that, getting 
adjusted to that attention. I’ve 
been trying to fit in, and I think 
I’ve been doing a really good job.”

Asiasi said he is just one of 

many kids who have left the 
Bay Area “with chips on their 
shoulder,” 
looking 
to 
prove 

themselves 
in 
schools 
with 

stronger football cultures.

With regular playing time as 

a freshman and a touchdown 
already under his belt, Asiasi 
seems to be doing just fine.

GRANT HARDY/Daily

Bryan Mone (90) has been practicing and could return Saturday.
Defensive line close 
to full strength again

The 
Michigan 
football 

team’s defensive line has hardly 
lacked bodies four weeks into 
the season, rotating at least six 
linemen at all times. Still, the 
addition of two fresh players 
back from injury in the past two 
weeks has been a welcome sight.

Senior defensive end Taco 

Charlton returned last week 
against Penn State from an 
ankle 
injury, 
and 
redshirt 

sophomore 
defensive 
tackle 

Bryan Mone could be back 
this week after a slightly more 
severe undisclosed ailment.

Both players started the 

season opener, but left the game 
before the first half ended. 
Mone, in particular, suffered a 
tough break after also missing 
last season with a broken ankle.

“Bryan has given so much 

to this program and to this 
defensive line, and he is so into 
that group,” said Michigan 
defensive 
line 
coach 
Greg 

Mattison. “Our players respect 
him so much. For him to get the 
injury that he had and to watch 
him again be another guy that 
has worked so 
hard at training 
and so hard at 
getting it back, 
him 
being 
at 

practice 
this 

week is exciting.

“The 
guys, 

when they saw 
him come out 
with his pads 
on, they see him, 
they’re excited about that. That 
fires them up, because they love 
him. They like how he plays, 
they like what it means to him. 
It’s just always good to have a 
guy like that back.”

It’s looking more likely by 

the day that Mone will make 
his return Saturday against 
Wisconsin. Head coach Jim 
Harbaugh said Monday that if 
Mone could practice this week, 
he was hopeful the defensive 
tackle could play in the game, 
and 
Mattison 
confirmed 

Wednesday 
that 
Mone 
is 

indeed practicing.

If Mone at least rejoins the 

rotation Saturday, he could spell 
an interior line that includes 
fifth-year seniors Ryan Glasgow 
and Matt Godin and redshirt 
junior Maurice Hurst. Those 
three players have already 
combined for 36 tackles (6.5 for 
loss) even though Hurst missed 
the opener with his own injury. 
In Mone, the Wolverines would 
gain another cog — one who 
Mattison said had one of the 
best performances of anyone in 
training camp.

As for Charlton, the senior 

returned to the starting lineup 
and made three tackles — 
including two for loss and 1.5 

sacks — in Saturday’s game.

“It’s great to have him back,” 

Mattison said. “I’m very, very 
proud of him. I’m proud of our 
training staff. He worked so hard 
at getting back, spent countless 
hours in the training room. You 
could see him out there — it was 
good to have him back.”

Recovering 
from 
various 

injuries, Michigan was aided by 
a significant talent advantage 
against its four opponents so 
far. If it has a full arsenal of 
defensive 
linemen 
available 

this weekend, it’ll come at the 
right time. The eighth-ranked 
Badgers will be by far their best 
opponent of the season.

The Wolverines will counter 

with a red-hot defensive line. 
After 
paving 
the 
way 
for 

blitzing linebackers earlier in 
the season, the defensive line 
garnered most of the attention 
against Penn State, combining 
for all six of the team’s sacks.

Mattison often notes that 

sacks aren’t everything, that if 
the defense can pressure the 
quarterback and force a quick 
throw, it can have a similar 
effect. Beyond just sacks, the 
defensive front should be able to 

fully pressure 
Wisconsin and 
try 
to 
make 

the Badgers as 
uncomfortable 
as Michigan’s 
first 
four 

opponents 
were.

“Sometimes, 

if 
you’re 

pressuring, 

they gotta decide, are they 
gonna block the linebacker 
or are they gonna block the 
D-linemen?” 
Mattison 
said. 

“This game, a number of those 
sacks were four-man rushes. 
There’s been a number of sacks 
that we’ve left out on the field, 
and our guys know that — where 
that if they would have just done 
this a little different, or they just 
got this, they would have got it.”

That’s a scary thought for 

opposing offensive lines, who 
have had enough problems 
handling Michigan’s rush early 
on. Wisconsin’s pass blockers are 
strong, but the Wolverines could 
also field their deepest rotation 
of the season if Mone returns.

It’s 
no 
secret 
the 

substitutions are a hallmark 
of Mattison’s philosophy, and 
a healthy Michigan line would 
make this a battle of strength 
versus strength.

“It’s 
gonna 
be 
a 
battle, 

and we’re gonna prepare like 
that,” said redshirt sophomore 
defensive end Chase Winovich 
on Monday. “That’s all I can 
really say about that — it’s gonna 
be a war every play, and I just 
can’t wait for it. It’s gonna be 
exciting. Our defense, I think, is 
ready for it.”

ELIZABETH XIONG/Daily

Junior goalkeeper Evan Louro (left) and senior defender Lars Eckenrode (right, #6) lifted Michigan to its first win of the season in 10 tries against Detroit on Wednesday. Louro delivered his second clean sheet of the season.
Wolverines record first win, snap nine-game winless skid

After overtime losses and missed 

chances, flurries of shots and little 
to show for it, 10 hard-fought 
games 
and 

a 
season’s 

worth 
of 

frustration, 
the Michigan men’s soccer team 
finally has its first win.

The Wolverines (0-4 Big Ten, 

1-6-3 overall) defeated Detroit 
on a rainy Wednesday night, 2-0, 
to conquer their first win since 
Halloween last year.

“It’s been a long time coming,” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
Chaka 

Daley. “I think we’ve dominated 
the roll of the ball (this season), 
dominated the good chances in 
the game, dominated possession 
in quite a few games. We’re 
obviously 
pleased 
with 
the 

performance, pleased that we 
scored 
some 
goals, 
pleased 

that we got a shutout and still 
continue the same mantra: one 
game at a time.”

The game started off as many 

have this season, with Michigan 
heavily controlling possession 
but lacking the creativity to finish 
in the final third. They came into 
the game having outshot nine 
of their 10 opponents, but tied 
for 184th nationally in scoring 

offense, averaging just .67 goals 
per game.

As the first half progressed, 

Michigan began pushing the 
tempo and creating more chances, 
though it faced the proposition 
of heading to the locker room 
without a goal for the ninth time 
this season.

But with two minutes until 

halftime, 
sophomore 
forward 

Francis Atuahene changed that 
misfortune when he rose above 
his defender and headed the ball 
into the right corner. The sense of 
relief from players and fans alike 
was palpable.

The goal gave Michigan a lead, 

but it meant more for the team 

mentally, given the offensive 
struggles and bad breaks that 
have defined the season to date.

“Goals change 

games,” 
said 

Daley. 

Added 

sophomore 
midfielder Robbie 
Mertz: “It did feel 
different coming 
into half with a 
one-goal 
lead. 

It was definitely 
a 
different 

mentality.”

With 
a 
newfound 
energy, 

Michigan maintained — even 
increased — its possession and 

intensity in the beginning of the 
second half. In the 49th minute, a 
beautiful cross-field through ball 

by 
sophomore 

defender 
Peter 

Brown landed at 
the feet of senior 
defender 
Rylee 

Woods. 
Woods 

darted past the 
right back and had 
his shot deflected 
toward the feet 
of 
Mertz, 
who 

made no mistake 
in adding a second 

goal to put the game out of reach.

The consistently stout defense 

helped the Wolverines cruise 

from there toward a clean sheet 
and a much-needed 2-0 victory.

Michigan will now try to earn 

its second win of the season 
on Sunday, when it hosts Penn 
State. And despite the adversity 
that has plagued the Wolverines 
for much of the season, Daley 
remains optimistic about the 
talent on the team.

“We’re 
certainly 
exciting, 

with some of the young guys — 
with (freshman forward) Jack 
Hallahan, Robbie Mertz, Francis 
Atuahene, (sophomore midfielder) 
Ivo Cerda,” Daley said. “They’re 
excellent, young, exciting players 
who are finding their way. And we 
still have half a season to go.”

Atuahene sparks Michigan with goal

Michigan 
forward 
Francis 

Atuahene’s 
unyielding 
attack 

continues.

The sophomore scored a goal 

on four shots in Michigan’s 
(0-4 Big Ten, 1-6-3 overall) 
2-0 victory over Detroit (0-2-1 
Horizon, 1-5-3 overall).

Atuahene, the 2015 Big Ten 

Rookie of the Year, has been a 
fixture in the starting lineup since 
joining the Wolverines, starting in 
22 of his 25 games played. In those 
games, Atuahene has been on the 
attack, demonstrating his speed, 
aggressiveness and passion.

“I’ve been playing soccer since 

I was very little, and that’s what 
brings joy to me,” Atuahene said. 
“I get excited when I’m on the 
field, and I’m passionate about it.” 

His jubilance and dominance 

have been evident since his 
rookie campaign, during which 
the Ghana native led Michigan 
in goals (10), shots on goal (28) 
and total shots (66). His stellar 
offensive impact led to him being 
awarded the 2015 team MVP.

Atuahene hasn’t slowed down in 

his second season. The sophomore 
currently ranks first in the Big 
Ten, and third in the nation, with 
2.29 shot attempts per game prior 
to Wenesday night’s game.

And 
even 
with 
defenses 

tailoring their game plans to stop 
Atuahene, he still leads Michigan 
with three goals this season. In an 
offense that has been stagnant at 
times, one couldn’t tell by watching 
Atuahene. He constantly moves 
around, looking for openings and 
playing with enthusiasm.

Wednesday, that energy was 

pivotal for the Wolverines, who 
picked up their first win of the 
season. 
Atuahene’s 
constant 

pressure paid off in the 43rd 
minute of the first half, when he 
cut down the right side of the 
field and scored a header off of a 
corner kick by junior midfielder 
Tristan Jacobs. The goal ignited 
the Michigan side going into the 
second half.

“Scoring a goal just before 

halftime really gave the team 
a good lift and something to 
hang onto,” said Michigan coach 
Chaka Daley. “Francis went in 
and attacked (the service) and 
smashed it in the back of the 

goal. I think it was perfectly 
constructed from a set-piece 
situation.”

Atuahene’s 
success 
at 
the 

collegiate level shouldn’t come 
as a surprise based upon his 
impressive prep career. Atuahene 
got his collegiate opportunity 
through the Right to Dream 
Academy, a program that gives 
young African soccer players 
better exposure by bringing them 
to the United States.

Through 
the 
program, 

Atuahene 
was 
granted 
a 

scholarship 
to 
play 
for 
The 

Hotchkiss School in Connecticut. 
There, he performed well enough 
to be the second-ranked senior 
in the country on College Soccer 
News’ player ranking.

Atuahene has made the most 

of the Right to Dream program 
and is very appreciative of the 
opportunity.

“Not everyone gets to play 

for the University of Michigan,” 
Atuahene said. “Any time I’m on 
the field competing for my school 
and competing for my team, 
I’m very excited and I’m very 
energetic. I want to win for my 
team and just enjoy the game.”

Atuahene scores late in first half, defense holds Detroit without a shot in second half; ‘M’ earns first victory since Oct. 31, 2015

Apparently I was in a coma when this whole Adidas craze 

started and I wish it could be comatose until it ends. 

Also, Stussy, hard pass. There are so many metal 

band tshirts here ... I didn’t know the clientele of 

Urban was so hardcore. Maybe they’ll pair their 

Metallica merch with their Adidas sneaks ... so 
fetch. In other news there is a $90 coat that 
looks like a blanket. I want it. I make minimum 
wage. Part of me wants everything and part 
of me wants to boycott. We lost Baked. Maybe 
there is a $90 coat that looks like a blanket. I 
want it. I make minimum wage. I’ll look for him 
in the home goods section. (Read: I’m a sucker 
for overpriced home decor.) Buzzed really wants 

to go hop in the photo booth ... hard pass pt. two. 

Why are the men’s t-shirts so high up? The patriarchy 

doesn’t want girls to wear t-shirts! Urban Outfitters is 

an extension of patriarchal domination! Or maybe I’m just 

short. But I’m going to go with the latter. Their record selection 

is ... interesting. Baked has got a hold of both Rihanna and Ariana Grande vinyl and it doesn’t look like he 
will be relinquishing them anytime soon. I bet “Into You” bangs on record. That was the most weirdly 
millennial thing I have ever said. Do I regret it? Not in the slightest. Buzzed keeps knocking down the 
records, which is pretty indicative of both her as a person and of her current blood alcohol level.

and write about their experiences.

this week’s event:

“I just wanna love U” by Jay Z and Pharrell is playing ..... predictable yet not 

problematic. Buzzed is living up to her title from her wine-vodka mix. I 

need to find my sister a bday gift. and myself an outfit for KANYE’S 

concert (my phone now automatically puts KANYE and 

RIHANNA in call caps). Did they just up and get rid of 

the sale section? this is bullshit I’m poor OMG 

I FOUND IT. it’s a big room now. I take 

it back. this isn’t bullshit. Why 

are 99.99% of urban tshirts so 

douchey? I found 1. Maybe.

10 mins til close: we. are. the. worst. 

I don’t want that shirt and there’s bleak 

gift options. also FUCK anyone who buys their

Sept. 22 marked the first day 

of fall, and the weather — as 
though a switch was flipped — 
quickly began to cool.

And as the leaves begin to 

change, so do the clothes.

To see what students were 

most excited about wearing 
for the fall, I stopped a few 
fashionable peers from all over 
campus to ask which article of 
clothing they couldn’t wait to 
break out for the fall 2016 season.

Students cited style icons 

from Cara Delevingne to Lady 
GaGa, and there appeared to be a 
huge, diverse range in the kinds 
of styles students wanted to 
emulate. However, the common 
factor among most Michigan 
students’ fashion decisions was 
comfort.

Art & Design sophomores 

Livvy Meyers and Alexa Moss 
confessed they had just been 
having a conversation about 
fall fashion right before being 
interviewed.

“You can just be wearing jeans 

and a T-shirt,” said Moss. “But 
if you throw on a cool jacket, it 
really brings the whole outfit 
together.”

Moss said her favorite thing 

to wear in the fall is a cute jacket 
— an overwhelming majority of 
students were enthusiastic about 
these as well — while Meyers 
added that she loves wearing 
scarves.

Music,

freshman Wyatt Stromer can’t 
wait to get into his warm clothes.

“I’m really looking forward 

to wearing long sleeve Vineyard 
Vines shirts, and my jean jacket 
that has a fur interior. It’s so 
warm,” Stromer said, adding that 
his style icon is Willow Smith.

LSA freshman Mary Obyrne 

also said she was excited to sport 
a jean jacket.

“It’s vintage and from a thrift 

shop,” she said. “It’s big and has a 
hood on it, so it’s really good for 
the fall.”

Obyrne 
described 
her 

personal style as being a bit 
bohemian and a bit urban.

“I’m 
from 
NYC, 
so 
I’m 

surrounded by everything. I 
like to try a bunch of different 
things,” Obyrne said. She named 
Cara Delevingne as her style 
icon.

“I’m super excited about my 

jackets,” said Izzy Genshaft, a 
senior who is double majoring in 
Psychology and History of Art, 
who describes her personal style 
as comfy and edgy.

“Oh that’s a tough question,” 

Genshaft said when asked who 
her style icons were. “I have so 
many! But I love the Olsen twins 
— particularly Mary-Kate.”

Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 

sophomore 
Edward 
Nunoo 

named Jesse Boykins III, a 
rhythm and blues singer, as his 
fashion icon. Nunoo described 
Boykins’s style as “eccentric and 
chill at the same time.”

“I have this really dope CPO 

olive trench coat that I’m really 
looking forward to wearing,” he 
said. “That, and this Polo Ralph 
Lauren Herrington jacket that I 
actually wore today. It’s so nice.

Nunoo described his personal 

style as a mix of genres.

“I mix a lot of business casual 

with some chic hipster bullshit,” 
he said with a laugh. “And a lot of 
mixing with athletic wear. I have 
a lot of really dope jerseys.”

Oversized 
comfy 
sweaters 

were also popular.

Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 

freshman 
Cameron 
King 

pointed at the big blue sweater 
she was wearing while being 
interviewed, and said she was 
excited to wear it all season.

LSA freshman Lilia Duncan 

said she is looking forward to 
wearing her new peacoat. “It’s 
a neutral color and goes with a 
lot,” Duncan said.

Additionally, 
Kinesiology 

junior Erin Almony said she 
is looking forward to wearing 
sweatpants and hoodies.

“I love big, baggier clothing 

and swoopy t-shirts,” Almony 
said.

She described her personal 

style as being comfortable, 
casual and cute — a style that 
seems to encapsulate many 
students at the University of 
Michigan.

THE VAULT | ‘CRUEL INTENTIONS’ (1999), COLUMBIA PICTURES

“Ay mami, I’mma make your boobs sweat.”

In “From the Vault,” Daily Arts 

takes a new look at old films.

In the eighth grade, I went on 

a school trip to London. I saw 
Big Ben and Windsor Castle and 
watched “Cruel Intentions” at 
least five times. There must have 
been something about the spring 
of 2011 that prompted British 
television schedulers to play the 
movie at all hours of the day. 
It was always on, and we were 
always watching it.

When I was 14, I thought it 

was just about the hottest thing 
I had ever seen. It was the pre-
“Gossip Girl” “Gossip Girl.” 
Rich, 
good-looking 
Manhat-

tan teens without any parental 
supervision getting drunk and 
having lots of sex. It seemed so 
unbelievably glamorous. When I 
rewatched it with my roommate 
this past week, I thought it was 
just about the most ridiculous 
thing I had ever seen. It was 
melodramatic and absurd, and 
yet, completely entertaining. 

The movie is a modern 

retelling 
of 
“Les 
Liaisons 

Dangereuses,” an 18th century 
French novel. Set in 1999 New 
York City, the film is set in motion 
by a bet between step-siblings 
Kathryn 
(Sarah 
Michelle 

Gellar) and Sebastian (Ryan 
Philippe, “I Know What You 
Did Last Summer”). If Sebastian 
can seduce their headmaster’s 
daughter, 
Annette 
(Reese 

Witherspoon, “Wild”), who’s 
a public supporter of waiting 
for marriage, then he can sleep 
with Kathryn. If he fails, then 
Kathryn gets his car. There’s 
also a side plot in which Kathryn 
tries to destroy the reputation of 
Cecile (Selma Blair, “The People 
v. O.J. Simpson”), because her 
ex-boyfriend has been pining 
after Cecile. It’s a tangle of sex, 
revenge, manipulation and, as 
the title would suggest, cruel 
intentions.

Everything about the film is 

so 
wonderfully 
over-the-top, 

from Sarah Michelle Geller’s 
cocaine-filled rosary to Selma 
Blair’s bratty whine. There isn’t 
even a hint of subtlety in “Cruel 
Intentions.” 
It’s 
absolutely 

absurd 
and 
absolutely 

incredible.

But for a plot so dependent on 

sex, the film’s central sex scene 
is 
really 
disappointing. 
It’s 

weird and forced and passion-
less. It’s a lot of extreme close-
ups of a panting Ryan Philippe 
and Reese Witherspoon’s boob 
sweat. Why are they so sweaty? 
How is that possible? Has any-

one ever actually sweated that 
much in the history of the 
world? Actually, for a movie 
that spends so much time talk-
ing about sex, there isn’t a lot of 
it. That just makes the hyper-
sexualization of characters like 
Sebastian and Kathryn all the 
more absurd.

So, 15 years later, many of the 

original criticisms of the film 
ring true. It’s a glorified teen 
soap opera. The acting is bad. 
The script is awful. But both of 
those things are just bad enough 
to make it campy instead of 
cringe-worthy. It’s full of the 
kind of sex, drugs and melodra-
ma that cult classics are made of. 
It’s not a good movie, but it’s so 
fun to watch.

So, as I paused the movie at 

the climax of its absurdity to 
laugh (I won’t spoil the ending 
but it does involve a fist fight in 
the middle of Central Park East), 
my roommate said, “this is so 
ridiculous, and I love it.”

“Cruel Intentions” has big 

aspirations. It wants to be both 
socially and intellectually pro-
vocative, it wants to be risky 
and clever — and it’s none of 
those things. But it’s so much 
fun. It’s the perfect bad movie 
to put you in a good mood.

If you still aren’t sold on 

“Cruel Intentions” as the ulti-
mate guilty pleasure movie, 
you get to see Sarah Michelle 
Gellar stomp her foot and yell, 
“I’m the Marcia fucking Brady 
of the Upper East Side.” Really, 
what could be better than that?

With Phantogram’s newest 
single, the duo continues to 
move away from the hip-hop-
drenched sound of Big Grams, 
a collaborative EP with Out-
Kast’s Big Boi, which the band 
spent performing to crowds at 
mainstream festivals this sum-
mer. “Same Old Blues,” how-
ever, doesn’t sonically coincide 
with the track’s title. Rather, 
its vibe is situated somewhere 

between techno-tinged gospel 
and pop-rock; the song opens 
with an echoing backup cho-
rus and just-there beat that 
builds into the song’s primary 
bass line. After a production 
breath, Barthel comes in, “And 
this is nothing new / It’s the 
same old blues.”
 She’s not completely wrong. 
The track’s lyrics, while 
catchy, paint the unoriginal 
picture of a recently failed 
relationship, building off of a 
number of those clichés: “I’m 
stuck in a hole and I can’t 
get out,” “My heart is on its 
knees,” “I think it’s time to let 
me go,” just to name a few. The 

track shines not in its lyricism, 
but in the production and 
instrumentation. The strip-
ping of the chorus to a cappel-
la on the final line before the 
hook displays a wide, deftly 
crafted range of sonic moods. 
The range is further widened 
by an out-of-nowhere electric 
guitar solo buried in a fuzzy 
bass drop during the song’s 
third act.
 Blues it is not, but it’s Phan-
togram’s fourth solid single in 
a row, setting up the band for 
a successful release of their 
third LP, Three, dropping 
next month.

FROM THE VAULT


As you walk into Today Cloth-

ing, the philosophy that defines 
the store is fairly clear. An elegant 
interior and muted color palette 
are juxtaposed with store speak-
ers softly playing vintage soul 
music, evoking a distinct sense of 
ease and artistry. Racks of men’s 
clothes neatly line the walls, 
eclectic and colorful sneakers 
are tucked in the back and tables 
placed around the store showcase 
what new and notable wares have 
come Today’s way. It calls Fourth 
Ave. its home, Literati its neigh-
bor and is a bit of an anomaly as 
far as Ann Arbor’s storefronts 
go. With its shelves boasting sto-
ried menswear brands like A.P.C., 
wings+horns and Norse Projects, 
one could move Today to one of 
the hipper streets in SoHo without 
anyone batting much of an eye — 
and that’s largely the point.

“Even if I wanted to shop (in 

Ann Arbor), there was nowhere I’d 
be excited to be going. We decided 
that it made sense to change that,” 
said Kevin Pearson, who owns 
and manages Today along with 
Eric Hardin, a fellow Michigan 
native and University of Michigan 
Engineering alum. “I knew no one 
was doing retail well here, or any-
where in southeast Michigan.”

What Hardin and Pearson 

sought to accomplish with Today 
was an audacious task, but its wel-
come presence in the city is the 

thankful product of what they said 
was “the timing being right.”

In addition to Today’s care-

fully envisioned design, Hardin 
and Pearson said they put great 
thought and consideration into 
each and every item that lines 
their storefront.

“We want items that look good, 

but we also want items that age 
well and that our customers can 
wear for years,” Hardin said.

Customers can find colorful 

and playful designs nestled along-
side monochromatic, classic looks; 
wares can range from effortlessly 
stylish and timeless threads from 
menswear brands like Our Legacy 
and Monitaly, to loud and personal 
pieces from the likes of Vans and 
local designer Yoshi, a Japanese 
transplant and former Comme 
Des Garçons collaborator wor-
thy of his own story. Today can 
even say it is one of a few store in 
the United States for many of the 
brands it carries — at the moment, 
Today is the only official stockist 
for A.P.C. products in the state of 
Michigan.

Beyond good looks and crafts-

manship, Today’s inventory is also 
telling of the kinds of people Har-
din and Pearson are. “Our brand 
is a map of who we’ve wanted to 
work with. We’re fortunate to say 
that most of these brands in here 
can be called our friends and we’re 
fortunate to work with them,” 
Pearson said.

On the graces of previously 

established industry connections, 

Hardin and Pearson were able to 
build Today thanks to personal 
relationships they’ve continued 
to foster; for every new brand put 
into consideration, “getting to 
know the brand and its people” is 
an integral process for Today, per 
Hardin.

“We decided to channel a lot 

of our relationships and got seri-
ous about a shared vision” — it’s 
an aspect of Today’s business that 
separates the store from many of 
its retail contemporaries.

Today is a refreshing fixture 

among Ann Arbor’s typical retail 
scene. Fronted by two gregarious 
(and, frankly, very cool) owners 
with an appreciation for all things 
creative and well-designed, Today 
affords its patrons a reasoned and 
tasteful introduction to male high 
fashion. As much as its inven-
tory is an illustration of the duo’s 
personalities, Today is equally 
an earnest homage to the art and 
sophistication of menswear (fit-
ting, considering their space used 
to house an art gallery). No matter 
one’s predispositions to fashion 
and menswear, Today’s contin-
ued contributions to Ann Arbor’s 
cultural landscape are worthy of 
recognition, and its significance 
in Ann Arbor’s retail and fashion 
scene will only grow as time goes 
on. Noting Today’s relationship 
with the city, Pearson said it best: 
“Ann Arbor just felt like home.” 
And for many of the city’s fashion-
able men, Today can function as a 
home in much of the same way.

How’s that mic taste?

As the school year gets into full 

swing, I mourn the loss of days I 
could spend watching Netflix and 
eating my body weight in Chipotle 
burritos. As the days get shorter 
and my time spent in the library 
gets longer, I hunt for new music 
to get me through the (recently 
chillier) 
September 
evenings. 

This is where Gabriel Garzón 
Montano comes in. 

Raised in Brooklyn with a clas-

sically trained singer for a mother, 
Montano began playing the violin 
at the age of six and continues to 
play various instruments today. 
His first and only release, Bish-
ouné: Alma Del Huila, features 
Montano playing every instru-
ment and writing all of the music 
for the six tracks. While Montano 
released the EP and toured along-
side Lenny Kravitz in the fall of 
2014, his most recent rise to fame 
occurred when Drake sampled 
his opening song “Six Eight” in 
“Jungle” off If You’re Reading This 
It’s Too Late.

“Six Eight” opens the EP with 

its sultry and seductive sound, 
setting the stage for what Mon-
tano hopes to accomplish with 

the rest of the album. I first heard 
the song in the closing episode of 
“Last Chance U” on Netflix, but 
aside from providing a soundtrack 
for a crying football team, “Six 
Eight” is passionate and sexy 
with slow, heavy beats and claps. 
The five-minute song boasts only 
four lines that Montano sings on 
repeat; “Rock me real slowly / Put 
a bib on me / I’m just like a baby, 
drooling over you / The things 
you do.” 

Following 
“Six 
Eight” 
is 

“Everything is Everything,” a 
track whose a cappella intro 
becomes its background accom-
paniment. It’s hip and clever, 
using traditional concepts of 
groove and rhythm to create an 
untraditional combination of pop 
and funk. “Naeja” lures listeners 
with light piano and techno beats, 
leaving them slightly uneasy 
when faced with the ominous 
undertones. The lyrics play into 
the restlessness of the steady, 
chorus-less track when Montano 
croons, “Thought I saw the man 
/ Just my own footsteps in the 
sand.”

The difficult to understand 

“Pour Maman” utilizes layered 
vocals, a tinkling piano and heavy 
bass to transform into a new rock 
sound, as Montano murmurs to 

a missing lover. Closing with the 
prophetic lyrics, “I’ll never leave 
you / I’d rather leave you,” “Pour 
Maman” mourns the loss of a 
past life. Transitioning quickly to 
“Keep On Running,” the most pia-
no-heavy song on the EP employs 
its instruments to mimic its title. 
With abrupt and hasty strokes to 
imitate running away from the 
past, its upbeat sound contrasts 
with the bleak lyrics, “Won’t ever 
get away / If you’re living for yes-
terday / Don’t expect things to 
change.” It’s simple and epito-
mizes Montano’s sound through a 
combination of traditional instru-
ments with modern remixes.

Bishouné: Alma Del Huila clos-

es with “Me Alone,” a soulful and 
sensuous song that makes good 
use of a steady drumbeat and 
electronic voices harmonizing in 
the background. Its closing lyrics, 
“Well well what a mighty hard 
life to lead / All this sunshine is 
heavy hangin’ over me / I know 
the grass is greener where the 
angels be,” speaks to the fear of 
loneliness and the starvation for 
touch that comes along with it. 
At the end of the EP, Gabriel Gar-
zón Montano leaves the listener 
with both a respect for a doomed 
past and a renewed sense of hope, 
looking ahead for better days.

Thursday, September 29, 2016 — 3B

 It’s time to herald the 
return of one the best, most 
underappreciated sitcoms on 
the air: “Brooklyn Nine-Nine.” 
Created by Michael Schur 
(“The Good Place”) and Dan 
Goor (“Parks and Recreation”), 
“Brooklyn” entered its fourth 
season last week with a 
premiere that continued its 
adventurous foray into more 
serialized storytelling.
 It’s ostensibly a series about 
cops in its eponymous pre-
cinct, but it’s probably better 
described as a workplace com-
edy. The show is a paragon of 
the network sitcom, an ideal 
every such series should aspire 
to. It’s a testament to diverse 
casting, the strengths of 
ensemble comedy and simply 
clever, hilarious writing.
 When the final “Greatest TV 
Duos” lists have been tabu-
lated, chief among the winners 

should be 
the mis-
matched 
cops Andy 
Samberg 
(“Popstar: 
Never Stop 
Never 
Stopping”) 
and Andre 
Braugher 
(“Homicide: 
Life on the 
Street”): 
this unholy pairing is about 
as weird, wacky and utterly 
hilarious as you’d expect. Sam-
berg’s trademark goofiness 
takes a backseat to his ironic 
sensibility and underrated 
charm, and this dynamic plays 
off Braugher’s deadpan perfec-
tion to create the most consis-
tent laughs a network comedy 
could hope to mine.
 The ensemble cast — 
including Terry Crews 
(“Everybody Hates Chris”), 
Chelsea Peretti (“Kroll 
Show”), Stephanie Beatriz 
(“Short Term 12”) and more 
— truly deserves to be in 

the same conversation as 
those of “Veep” and “Silicon 
Valley.” And, as of the past 
season, “Brooklyn” has even 
ventured out of standard 
case-of-the-week plots into 
longer arcs — and done so to 
predictably great success. It’s 
ultimately a shame, then, that 
the show is comparatively 
underappreciated. FOX is 
home to a dizzying menu 
of fantastic comedies — 
“New Girl,” “Bob’s Burgers” 
“Last Man On Earth” — but 
“Brooklyn Nine-Nine” is 
what everyone, at some point, 
needs: comfort food.

“Season Four Premiere”

Brooklyn Nine-Nine

FOX

DEF JAM

Life is like a box of balls.

Admit it: there’s been a time 

(or 100) when you’ve found 
yourself to be in your feelings. 
You feel emo — it happens. 
It’s often unwarranted and 
unprecedented; it may be due 
to lack of sleep and/or food, 
the exam you have on Tuesday 
or the exam you had (and may 
have failed) last Tuesday or 
because you finally found the 
person from your big lecture 
class that you’ve been nursing 
a crush on all year, and you see 
on Facebook that they’ve been 
in a relationship with someone 
for two years. Who really cares 
why you’re feeling emo — the 
point is, you just are.

I learned in my musicology 

course last year that listening 
to sad songs while you are sad 
actually does make you feel 
better. It makes you feel as 
though whatever it is you’re 
feeling is valid, and after you 
belt your heart out (or just cry 
and listen) to your sad song of 
choice, you undergo a sort of 
catharsis that leaves you feeling 
cleansed. Plus, the act of singing 
releases endorphins, so singing 
when you are sad will make you 
feel happier. With that in mind, 
if you do happen to find yourself 
in the feels for no apparent 
reason, check out the songs 
below:

“Ivy” — Frank Ocean
It begins with a reverberated 

guitar melody that progresses as 
Ocean’s soothing yet powerful 
vocals build. Then, it pierces 
through all the walls and all 
the bullshit that you have 
worked to hide behind. Ocean 
perfectly begins soft and low, 
so when only 30 seconds in, he 
skips up an octave into a more 
exasperated, emotional tone, 
the listener is ready to let go 
of the strength and composure 
they feel they must uphold. 
This build up is expert, and is 
executed at a level that isn’t 
often heard, even from artists 
of the same caliber. With ease, 

Ocean juxtaposes an angsty and 
nonchalant tone, representing 
the whiplash of the constant 
battle of feeling and caring too 
much and not at all (“If you could 
see my thoughts you would see 
our faces” vs. “It’s quite alright 
to hate me now”). His lyrics are 
nostalgic, constantly referring 
to “back then” — a time that 
every listener has, a time that 
every listener thinks of and a 
time that every listener, at some 
point, wants to return to.

“Don’t Think Twice It’s 

Alright” — Bob Dylan

Dylan’s 
apathetic 
yet 

powerful lyrics, combined with 
his soft-spoken singing, are 
like a stream of consciousness 
within your own head. With 
lines such as “I ain’t saying 
you treated me unkind / You 
could’ve done better, but, I don’t 
mind, / You just kind of wasted 
my precious time, / But don’t 
think twice, it’s alright,” Dylan 
succinctly puts the hardship 
of breaking up with someone, 
even after reluctantly realizing 
that neither the relationship 
nor the person was perfect, into 
words. The matter-of-factness 
in Dylan’s tone that basically 
says “you suck, but it’s seriously 
fine!” allows you to easily sing 
along and convince yourself 
that maybe it really is seriously 
fine.

“Michicant” — Bon Iver
Listening to Bon Iver feels 

like sitting on a rock in the 
middle of a moving river, with 
your feet in the cool-but-not-
too-cold water, with the sun 
hitting your chest and the smell 
of trees filling your olfactory 
senses. It’s like being where you 
are most comfortable, with a 
warm blanket and a cup of tea, 
with your favorite book and your 
favorite person and a glass of 
your favorite kind of expensive 
alcohol. This song is one of my 
personal favorites from Justin 
Vernon, for the harmonies of 
his voice and the entrancing 
instruments. I don’t quite even 
know how to describe his music; 
it is hopeful and yet bittersweet. 

There is something about it that 
can mend a broken heart, a bad 
day or a disappointment.

“Yes I’m Changing” — Tame 

Impala

The first time I heard this 

song — to put it frankly — I 
was like, “Yaaaaas.” Taking 
in the ambient vocals and 
synthesizers 
combined 
with 

the strong beat of the bass and 
drums will inadvertently have 
you nodding your head. The 
lyrics are dreamy and matter of 
fact; they have a way of relating 
to different aspects of life that 
make this song applicable to 
almost 
any 
situation. 
This 

song is cathartic, with hopeful 
lyrics such as “There is another 
future waiting there for you” 
or “There is a world out there 
that is calling my name / And 
it’s calling yours too,” and the 
electronic, psychedelic track 
consumes your being, allowing 
your mind to get a break from 
the war within.

“Love is a Losing Game” — 

Amy Winehouse

These 
lyrics 
are 
poetry. 

Winehouse’s voice is poetry. 
The music is poetry. Without 
any 
music, 
the 
words 
are 

incredibly sad, beautiful and 
real. And Amy Winehouse, well, 
she could be singing the phone 
book and I would probably 
still be sitting on my bed and 
crying. The combination of 
her voice, the words and her 
musical choices are enthralling, 
with each breath, vocal run and 
carefully chosen accented word 
or note bringing meaning to the 
song that is deeper than what’s 
on the surface. You don’t only 
feel the pain Winehouse brings 
forth through this song, you 
share it with her. Written by 
Winehouse herself, the lyrics 
and music are so cohesive; the 
words are deep and thought 
provoking, while the music 
is repetitive and simple. The 
simplicity of the music makes 
the song raw. Winehouse forces 
you to listen to everything she 
is saying and feel it completely; 
she leaves you no other choice.
