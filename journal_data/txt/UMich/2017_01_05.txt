On his way to attend an 

accessibility event hosted in 
Ann Arbor by the University 
of 
Michigan 
Council 
for 

Disability Concerns in early 
December, the Ann Arbor 
Metro Airport Shuttle denied 
service to Stephen Kuusisto, 
a 
Syracuse 
University 

education professor who is 
blind. Kuusito said he was 
denied service because he had 
his guide dog with him. 

Days before traveling to 

Ann Arbor, while still at home 
in Syracuse, Kuusisto phoned 
Ann Arbor Metro Airport 
Shuttle based on a suggestion 

from a University list of 
approved services. Despite 
being recommended by the 
University, the taxi owner 
told Kuusisto he would not 
give him a ride with his guide 
dog.

“The guy was perfectly 

cheerful, until I mentioned I 
was blind and have a Seeing 
Eye dog,” Kuusisto said.

Kuusisto said the University 

took the taxi company off the 
list of recommended services 
immediately 
following 
his 

incident, and sent the service 
a cease-and-desist letter to 
stop them from using the 
University’s logo.

The world can’t stop laughing 

— or at least over text.

The crying-laughing face is 

the world’s most popular emoji, 
researchers at the University 
of 
Michigan 
and 
Peking 

University determined in a joint 
study, according to a University 
press 
release 
published 
in 

December.

Emojis 
— 
ranging 
from 

simplistic 
smiling 
faces 
to 

animals to flags to eggplants— 
have been seen more recently 
with the rise of smartphones 
and social media sites, allowing 
users to simply place an image 
instead of spelling out longer 
messages or reactions. 

The 
University 
study 

examined emoji usage from 
3.88 million active users from 
212 different countries and 
regions from Sep. 1 to Sep. 30, 
2015. Nearly one-third of the 
active users analyzed in the 
data study consisted of users in 
the United States, though Brazil 
and Mexico also held heavily 
dominant users.

Wei Ai, a doctoral student 

at the University’s School of 
Information, 
authored 
the 

study report, one of the first 
large-scale analyses of emoji 
usage.

“(Emojis) 
are 
becoming 

the 
ubiquitous 
language 

that bridges everyone across 
different cultures,” Ai said in 

the press release.

The red heart and heart-eyes 

face ranked second and third, 
respectively.

The 
study 
also 
factored 

cultural 
attitudes 
and 

norms into emoji usage. The 
researchers found that users 
from different countries had 
considerable 
divergence 
in 

emoji usage, variance which was 
mainly related to differences in 
cultural backgrounds.

Texters 
from 
countries 

highly valuing individualism 
such as Australia, France and 
the Czech Republic sent more 
happy emojis. In societies more 
concerned with uncertainty, 
such as those in Portugal, 
Chile 
and 
Peru, 
however, 

users tended toward emojis 
expressing negative feelings.

The widespread use of emojis 

presents an opportunity for 
researchers in fields ranging 

from linguistics to data science. 
According to the study, emojis 
are shared worldwide, and 
research questions previously 
restricted by language and 
geographic barriers can now be 
studied using the icons.

“Research 
questions 
that 

previously 
rely 
on 
small-

scale user surveys can now be 
answered through analyzing 
large-scale behavioral data,” 
the study reads.

Ringing 
in 
the 
new 

year 
brought 
good 
news 

for 
employees 
throughout 

Michigan 
when 
the 
state 

minimum wage increased by 
40 cents — from $8.50 to $8.90 
per hour — as a part of the 
Workforce Opportunity Wage 
Act.

The state bill, which passed 

in 2014, aims to gradually 
increase Michigan’s minimum 
wage from the 2014 rate of 
$7.40 an hour to $9.25 by the 
beginning of 2018. With the 
current 
increase 
to 
$8.90, 

Michigan has the 15th-highest 
state minimum wage in the 
country, 
according 
to 
the 

Detroit News.

Stagnating 
wages 
were 

a 
theme 
of 
the 
recent 

presidential 
election, 
with 

one in every five Americans 
worried about wage reduction, 
according to a 2015 Gallup 
poll. President-elect Donald 
Trump has said he supports an 
hourly minimum wage of $10, 
but thinks states should decide 
what exact number it should be

Top-ranked curriculum updated to keep pace with changing job market 

Due 
to 
evolution 
within 

the demands of the supply 
chain industry, the University 
of Michigan Ross School of 
Business 
recently 
updated 

its Master of Supply Chain 

Management 
Program. 
The 

enhanced program is expected 
to better prepare students for 
the future and help the MSCM 
to maintain its ranking among 
the top five best programs in the 
country.

Business Dean Scott DeRue 

said 
in 
a 
University 
press 

release that maintaining the 

program’s prestige will help 
future generations of students 
stay updated in an evolving 
field. The program will help 
graduates in future job searches 
as well as create more intimate 
relationships 
with 
industry 

partners.

“With these new offerings, 

we are preparing the next 

generation of leaders for the 
dynamic and complex supply 
chains of tomorrow,” DeRue 
said.

One central change to the 

program includes shortening 
it from 12 months down to 10 
months. 
Previously, 
students 

obtained summer internships,

In a recently compiled list of all 

50 states by their respective winter’s 

level of misery, the state of Michigan 

came out as having the second-worst 

winter, behind only Minnesota. The 

online travel site Thrilllist considered 

a variety of factors when ranking 

the states, such as those with most 

unbearable winters, including 

temperature, local anecdotes and 

poor traffic condidions.

The site stated Michigan’s winter 

is notable for its length: beginning in 

October and historically not ending 

until April, when much of the country 

is already welcoming spring. While 

research indicates that other states 

ranked lower on the list may have 

subzero temperatures or higher 

average snowfall, Michigan is unique 

for its lack of sunshine and constantly 

gray skies, according to the site.

Bison Messink, Thrillist 

deputy editor and a self-described 

“recovering Michigander,” also 

noted in the report that other aspects 

of winter, like snow sports, do not 

salvage Michigan because of the 

state’s unfavorable topography. 

“Overnight, the road freezes,” 

Messink wrote. “In the morning 

you wake up and it is still dark. … 

You actually look forward to proper 

snowfall, just to cover the dirt. Even 

then, you do not go skiing, because 

there are no hills.”

Indeed, as students return for 

second semester at the University 

of Michigan, which is uniquely 

named “winter term”— rather than 

the common “spring term”adopted 

by many other universities like 

Ohio State and the University 

of Pennsylvania— skies will be 

consistently gray in Ann Arbor this 

week, and low temperatures expected 

to drop to 10 degrees Fahrenheit after 

sunset.

These conditions, which will 

persist for at least three more months 

and also described by Messink as 

“Godforsaken,” inspired Michigan’s 

high ranking on the list.

All contributors to the lsit are 

familiar with the various states, but 

the top states are notorious even 

among debaters of weather.

“(We) have both experienced 

the personal hell that is winter’s 

awkwardly long, frigid embrace,” 

editors Matt Lynch and Kevin 

Alexander wrote for Thrillist. “And so 

began an intense period of research 

and debate. … This is one of those 

things where you probably actually 

want to finish last.”

ON THE DAILY: MICHIGAN WINTER RANKED 2ND WORST IN U.S.

PAUL AHNN/Daily

Student exercise at the Intramural Sports Building on Wednesday.

NEWS YE AR S RESOLUTIONS

The American Institute for 

Economic Research ranked 
Ann Arbor as the best small 
metro 
college 
destination 

on its 2017 list of top U.S. 
college destinations, released 
Wednesday 
morning. 
This 

ranking 
evaluates 
college 

metro areas based on their 
quality 
of 
life, 
economic 

climate 
and 
student 

demographics. 
The 
rating 

system is also broken down 
into large metros, midsize 
metros, 
small 
metros 
and 

towns.

According 
to 
the 
AIER 

website, quality of life and 
demographics played a larger 
role than economic climate 
in this year’s top rankings on 
the AIER College Destination 

Index.

To measure quality of life, 

AIER researchers looked at the 
presence of art, entertainment 
venues and restaurants, as 
well as commuter use of public 

transit, walking, biking and 
other alternatives to cars.

“Another characteristic of 

a great city is its abundance 
of 
‘third 
places,’ 
that 
is, 

places that are neither work 
nor home, where people can 
gather,” the AIER website 
states. “These spaces may be 
parks and plazas or bars and 
pubs.”

Researchers 
at 
AIER 

analyze the economic climate 
of a destination by looking at 
youth unemployment rates, 
labor force participation of 
the working-age population, 
presence of workers in STEM 
fields and rent.

AIER researchers selected 

Ann Arbor as the top small 
metro due to the substantial 
number of graduates living 
in the area and the high level 
of diversity and affordable 
homes. The researchers claim 
these features attract many 
younger residents.

“(Ann Arbor) unsurprisingly 

has the highest percentage of 
college graduates in our Small 
Metro category, along with 
relatively high diversity, many 
restaurant and entertainment 
options, 
and 
good 
public 

transportation access,” the 
website states. “Ann Arbor 
offers lower rents than coastal 
cities with similar amenities.”

The University of Michigan 

itself has been listed in many 
college rankings in the past 
year, including being ranked 
as the number one public 
university in the country by 
the Wall Street Journal and 
Times 
Higher 
Education, 

the 
world’s 
number 
one 

public college ranking by the 
global 
education 
company 

Quacquarelli 
Symonds 
and 

27th nationally among all 
colleges and universities in 
2017 in the U.S. News and 
World Report annual ranking.

Tallahassee, 
Fla., 
and 

Durham-Chapel 
Hill, 
N.C., 

took the second and third 
rankings, respectively, on the 
site’s small metros rankings.

The Three Oaks-based Mid 

America Cowgirls Rodeo Drill 
Team, an equestrian drill team 
featuring a variety of horse 
breeds, will send a group of 
44 women and 18 horses to 
Washington D.C.

Upon being selected, Debbie 

Dunphy, team coordinator and 
captain, said in an interview 
with the Harbor County News 
she was shocked and knew 
they had to kick it into high 
gear.

“I really couldn’t believe it,” 

Dunphy said. “There’s so much 
to do but they don’t give us a 
lot of time.”

On the other hand, this 

will be the Michigan Multi-
Jurisdictional Mounted Police 
Drill Team & Color Guard’s 
third 
inaugural 
parade, 

having performed in both of 
Barack Obama’s inauguration 
celebrations in 2008 and 2012. 
The organization is famous 
for choreographing intricate 
drills with horses.

Adena Collens, a senior 

at Berkley High School in 
Berkley, Mich., is a member 
of 
her 
school’s 
orchestra 

program. Every four years, 
the 
orchestra 
travels 
to 

Washington D.C. to perform in 
the WorldStrides Inauguration 
Heritage Festival and attend 
the presidential inauguration. 

But this year, Collens said she 
opted to stay behind.

“Personally, 
I’m 
not 

politically aligned with Mr. 
Trump but at the same time, 
my dad is going to chaperone 
on the trip and we both were 
concerned for our safeties,” 
she said.

Collens cited the violence 

that has been promoted at 
Trump’s rallies as one of the 
reasons she would fear for 
her safety if she went on the 
trip. She also said race is an 
important factor behind to 
why some of her friends will 
not be heading to Washington 
D.C. with the orchestra.

“I’m white, so I wouldn’t 

personally be targeted for my 
race,” Collens said. “I have 
friends who aren’t, and that’s 
the reason why they cannot go. 
It makes me a little upset that 
we’re still going on this trip 
even though it wouldn’t be safe 
for my friends of color to be in 
the crowd for hours.”

As for the rest of the 

inauguration 
celebration, 

many 
musicians 
in 
recent 

months 
have 
outwardly 

rejected 
Trump’s 
inquiries 

about performing. Acts such 
as Elton John, Kiss, Celine 
Dion and others have publicly 
declined offers.

When asked why the Mid 

America 
Cowgirls 
Rodeo 

Drill Team accepted the job, 
Dunphy said her team put 
politics aside and decided to 
represent the organization as 
citizens of this country.

“We’re doing this because 

we’re Americans,” she said. 
“We look at this as an honor.”

In response to musicians 

refusing to play, Collens said 
she is supportive of people 
who stand by their morals but 
will not judge acts that choose 
to perform.

“People 
should 
believe 

in what they believe in and 
support 
the 
people 
that 

support their own beliefs, but 
I do also know that there are 
some 
circumstances 
where 

corporate pressures and the 
pressures of being a freelance 
musician, it’s difficult to say 
no to a gig,” Collens said.

TRUMP

service, but Kuusisto’s main 
concern still remains. Because 
he was denied a cab and an 
alternative route to get to 
the campus from the airport, 
Kuusisto says his civil rights 
under the Americans with 
Disabilities 
Act 
have 
been 

violated.

“The law is very specific,” 

Kuusisto said. “If you have an 
allergy, you’re not obligated to 
take somebody with a Seeing 
Eye dog, but you are obligated 
to get them a ride.”

The story went viral on social 

media after Kuusisto wrote a 
blog post about it on Dec. 3, the 
day before he traveled to Ann 
Arbor. In the post, he wrote 
about his experience with the 
owner of the taxi company 
and posted the driver’s phone 
number on his Facebook page. 
In response, many reporters 
contacted the owner of the taxi 
service.

“I was subjected to absolute 

harassment by the man who 
picked up the phone, who said 
he didn’t have to transport 
my guide dog,” Kuusisto said. 
“When I told him it was the 
law, believe it or not, he said, 
‘Trump’s victory changes all 
that.’ He was nasty, brutish 
and shouting at me.”

This 
incident 
holds 

relevance 
following 
the 

recent presidential election of 
Donald Trump. The president-
elect’s 
campaign 
has 
not 

touched 
heavily 
on 
public 

concerns 
about 
disability 

accommodations.

During 
the 
election 

season, Trump was criticized 
for 
seemingly 
mocking 
a 

reporter with a congenital 
joint condition, imitating the 
limited movement in his arms.

“I merely mimicked what I 

thought would be a flustered 

reporter trying to get out of 
a statement he made long 
ago,” Trump later said in a 
statement, 
adding 
that 
he 

had “tremendous respect for 
people 
who 
are 
physically 

challenged.”

Ari Ne’eman, president of 

the Autistic Self Advocacy 
Network, said in an article 
on Disability Scoop disability 
issues have generally remained 
a 
bipartisan 
issue 
in 
the 

past, with advocates working 
together 
to 
keep 
special 

education and other programs 
in place.

“One of the challenges here 

is that the (Trump) campaign 
was not very specific about 
disability policy plans, and 
those areas that they were 
specific about concern us,” 
Ne’eman said.

Reactions 
on 
Yelp 
and 

Facebook supported Kuusisto 
following the incident. As of 
Wednesday, the Ann Arbor 
Metro Airport Shuttle has one 
star on Yelp.

“NEVER 
USE 
THESE 

BIGOTS! 
This 
company 

denied service to a nationally 
respected professor because he 
is disabled and has a guide dog,” 
one user from New York wrote 
on the page. “The operator 
spouted some nonsense about 
how being a Trump supporter 
allows him to discriminate 
against disabled people.”

Kuusisto said overall there 

was outrage toward the events 
he wrote about.

“People 
responded 
with 

absolute 
disgust,” 
Kuusisto 

said. “There were plenty of 
other people to call for a ride. 
The head of the University 
Library, Charles Watkinson, 
came and picked me up. And 
then when I had to go home, 
they arranged a car service.”

Kuusisto said he would have 

looked the other way had the 
driver told him he didn’t take 
dogs and hung up. Instead, he 
said it was more unsettling 
than that, because the driver 
told him he “did not care” 
about his rights and would not 
give him an alternative means 
to campus.

“This got out of control,” 

Kuusisto said. “He was rude 
to me and discriminatory. This 
is not normal by any means. It 
was just an unusual incident.”

The 
owner 
of 
the 
taxi 

service, who asked to remain 
anonymous for this article, 
said he regrets the incident and 
is sympathetic toward those 
with disabilities, stating he 
has served blind people in the 
past. The only difference, he 
said, is that this was his first 

encounter of serving a blind 
person with a guide dog.

“I have respect for everyone,” 

the owner said. “But I do have 
allergies. Honest to goodness I 

was worried about having the 
dog. I have to take care of my 
car; it’s how I run my business. 
This was a big lesson for me, 
though, and in the future, I’m 
going to keep taking care of 
everyone.”

Since the story went viral, 

the owner said he has been 
receiving 
messages 
from 

reporters and people online 
calling him “deplorable,” an 
insult made towards Trump 
supporteres following a Sept. 
9 speech by Hillary Clinton 
wherein 
the 
Democratic 

candidate referred to “half” of 
Trump’s supporters as such. 
The owner said this, along 
with the reviews on Yelp, does 
not accurately reflect what 
happened.

“This is a sensitive issue to 

me,” the owner said. “This was 
the first time in my life I’ve 
been in this situation. I totally 
regret the incident. I made 
a mistake, but I’m not a bad 
person and this had nothing 
to do with politics. If given 
the chance, I would do it over 
again.”

Kuusisto said in his blog 

post the owner said he didn’t 
want dogs because they are 
“dirty.” The owner denied this, 
though, and said the reason 
for his apprehension was due 
to his allergies. The owner 
said though he didn’t offer an 
alternative means for Kuusisto 
to get to campus, he tried 
following up to offer him a ride 
in a voicemail.

“He changed some of the 

words,” the owner said. “I did 
offer him a ride after he called, 
and left him a voicemail.

Jack 
Bernard, 
chair 
of 

the University Council for 
Disability 
Concerns, 
said 

though 
discrimination 
of 

any kind is unacceptable, the 
amount of support Kuusisto 
received at the University event 
he attended was uplifting.

“Of course, it was unsettling 

for Professor Kuusisto and it 
is never good for anyone to 
intentionally 
discriminate 

against someone because she 
or he has a disability,” Bernard 
said. “The response to this 
incident 
was 
an 
abundant 

outpouring 
of 
support 
for 

Professor Kuusisto. Individuals 
in the community offered him 
airport-to-hotel ride service, 
others sent notes, still others 
discussed the matter on social 
media.”

Since the incident, the taxi 

service has altered its website, 
with a heading on its website 
stating: “We’re prompt 100% 
committed professionals and 
are proud to serve and respect 
our veteran clients and clients 
with disabilities.” Regardless 
of the gesture, Kuusisto said, 
he has filed a formal complaint 
with the U.S. Department 
of Justice and the Michigan 
Department of Civil Rights.

Despite 
the 
situation, 

Kuusisto 
remarked 
on 

the 
positive 
response 
and 

welcome he received from the 
University community during 
his visit.

“I 
certainly 
didn’t 
feel 

unsupported,” Kuusisto said.

Bernard added, though, the 

University is taking no specific 
action other than removing 
the taxi company from the list 
of services. He said the best 
ways to resolve situations like 
this is to be more welcoming 
and equitable to those with 
disabilities.

“What we saw here was 

diversity, equity and inclusion 
operating as it should — where 
individuals in the community 
work as individuals and as 
part of groups to respond 
to make the campus a more 
inviting place,” Bernard said.

but a new experiential course 
now 
directly 
pairs 
students 

with companies during winter 
semester to complete a project. 
With this change, students will 
spend more time on the Ann 
Arbor campus in order to gain 
a more in-depth experience in 

the business school. The shift in 
scheduling also accommodates 
the 
scheduling 
of 
corporate 

recruiting.

Other 
changes 
to 
the 

curriculum 
include 
a 
larger 

focus on the data and analytics 
of key trends within the supply 
chain management industry, in 
addition to focuses on leadership 
development 
and 
general 

business 
education. 
Students 

within MSCM will also take an 
action-based learning course, the 
Supply Chain Consulting Studio, 
to gain real-world experience in 
a corporate environment.

The new MSCM now includes 

a corporate advisory council — 
a group comprised of industry 
leaders to serve as advisers, 
mentors and partners to MSCM 

faculty and students.

Massachusetts 
Institute 
of 

Technology currently has the 
top-ranked 
MSCM 
program, 

according to U.S. News and 
World Report. Similar to the 
University’s 
program, 
MIT’s 

MSCM is a 10-month program 
entirely 
on 
MIT’s 
campus. 

Different from the University’s 
program, 
though, 
MIT’s 

program incorporates a month 
abroad for real-world experience 
rather than something like the 
Business School’s action-based 
learning course.

Bill Hall, a Libertarian on the 

State Board of Education who is 
the head of sustainability at Fiat-
Chrysler Automobiles, said in 
the press release he was excited 
to provide career guidance and 

connections to the program’s 
students.

“The 
restructured 
Ross 

MSCM Program, fueled by its 
progressive curriculum, high-
impact, action-based learning 
module and close collaboration 
with 
the 
corporate 
sector, 

is destined to accelerate its 
production of elite supply chain 
innovators,” he said.

set at, CNN reported.

Minimum wage in 18 other 

states also rose on Jan. 1, 2017, 
according to the Wall Street 
Journal. 

Students employed through 

the University of Michigan 
generally make above the state 
minimum wage. Many jobs 
such as University dining hall 
positions, pay students hourly 
starting wages of $9.40 to 
$13.40.

LSA freshman Kelly Wester 

predicted the increase would 
benefit 
students 
already 

saddled with fees. 

“Most of my things went 

towards things I needed for 
school, so any increase in 
wages 
would’ve 
definitely 

helped me out,” she said. “It 
may seem small but I think 
the cumulative impact of a 
minimum wage increase can 
make a huge difference in the 
life of a worker.” 

According to the Student 

Employment Office database, 
there were 3,151 University and 
non-University job openings 
for students as of Wednesday 
evening. Furthermore, as of 
November 2016, Ann Arbor 
has a 3 percent unemployment 
rate, below Michigan’s 4.9 
percent rate. The wage curve 
theory suggests that because 
of this surplus of jobs and low 
unemployment, wages in Ann 
Arbor tend to be higher.

Many 
non-University 

employers in Ann Arbor like 
Starbucks Coffee also offer 
pay above the minimum wage. 
Eric Kurtz, a supervisor at the 

Starbucks in the Ross School 
of 
Business, 
said 
student 

workers at the chain would 
most likely not be affected by 
the minimum wage increase.

“(The 
minimum 
wage 

increase) is not going to be 
that big of an impact, because 
a lot of our students get hired 
in at around the $9.50- to 
$10-an-hour rate anyways,” 
Kurtz said. “When you have to 
talk to the public as much and 
be as skilled as you do at some 

of these jobs, you come in at a 
little bit higher rate.”

Engineering 
sophomore 

Jason 
Wozniak 
works 
as 

an entrance monitor at the 
Michigan Union, and agreed 
with 
Kurtz’s 
assessment. 

Wozniak 
did 
not 
foresee 

any 
incremental 
increase 

impacting 
his 
long-term 

income, as he does not expect 
to work many minimum wage 
jobs in the future. 

“I’m no expert in economics, 

but I don’t see this affecting 
me in the immediate future 
since I already make above 
$8.90/hour,” he said.

T

o the man who told me 
to give Donald Trump a 
chance: 

Well hi, how are you? I 

hope you are having a nice 
time ice skating with your 
granddaughter — my friend and 
I were until you reminded us of 
what the majority of Americans 
think is the country’s latest 
blunder. It’s funny that you 
picked us out to talk about 
this. What gave us away? I 
know we fit the demographics 
of Hillary Clinton supporters: 
We 
are 
both 
college-aged 

women and I’m Black, but we 
left our “Stronger Together” 
signs at home. You got us, as 
much as I tried to tone down 
my liberalism to keep everyone 
in the suburbs of Michigan 
calm, you saw right through 
me. You seem like a nice person 
and I appreciate your openness, 
politeness and maturity when 
discussing Donald Trump’s win. 
I am not taking it as well as you 
are. You are happy but I am left in 
a numb and groggy state similar 
to when I got my tonsils removed. 
I am surprised that Trump won 
the election, but I am mainly 
disappointed. “Really,” I think to 
myself on a daily basis, “people 
really chose him?”

Obviously, it is not fair to 

demonize Trump supporters. 
Just because he was endorsed 
by the Ku Klux Klan doesn’t 
mean all of his supporters are 
racist. He makes statements 
that condone sexual assault, but 
not all his supporters agree with 
these remarks. When people 
decide to vote for a candidate, 
they make that decision based 
on many different reasons. The 
importance of the economy, 
national security and other issues 
caused Trump voters to overlook 
his inflammatory remarks.

While racism and sexism 

are issues some people may be 

able to compromise on, for me 
they are not. This is probably 
because I am a Black woman, 
but you do not have to be a 
minority or a woman to realize 
that these issues are serious 
and not something to just write 
off. You may not think about 
these matters as much as I do, 
but if you are at all aware of 
the United States’ history and 
legacy of racism and sexism you 
would pay attention to them. If 
a candidate constantly criticizes 
women in a way that reduces 
them to their appearance, that 
is a major problem. If a grown 
man claims that a president’s 
birth certificate is not valid 
because 
he 
looks 
different 

and has an uncommon name, 
that is ridiculous. Expecting 
a president not to be racist or 
sexist should not be too much 
to ask.

You need to explain how you 

reconcile voting for Trump, a 
man who clearly disrespects 
women, 
with 
having 
a 

granddaughter. Did you think 
about how your granddaughter 
would feel if Trump treated 
her the way he treats Megyn 
Kelly or Rosie O’Donnell? Were 
you aware of the sexual assault 
allegations directed at him and 
did you hear what he called 
“locker 
room 
talk?” 
While 

voters 
expect 
presidential 

candidates to be critical of their 
opponents’ 
experience 
and 

ideas, it is not OK to lob insults 
like “nasty woman” at them. 
Even if you don’t identify as a 
feminist, I think that we can 
both agree no woman should 
be reduced to something that 
Trump, or anyone, can grab 
and insult as he has bragged 
about doing.

You also told me to give 

people like you a chance, but 
I think you need to be more 
concerned about whether or 
not the man you elected is 
willing to do that. Entrusting 
the task of bringing jobs back 
to America to a man who uses 

overseas manufacturers seems 
counterintuitive. 
The 
same 

businessman who criticizes 
China’s trade policies and says 
that they hurt U.S. businesses 
has his clothing manufactured 
there. Doesn’t this contribute 
to the problem?

You may have been one of 

the voters stressing the need 
for a relatable “Washington 
outsider” — but Trump does 
not seem to be the best fit for 
this idea. He’s a billionaire 
— not exactly your average 
Joe. 
Technically, 
he 
is 
a 

“Washington outsider” in the 
sense that he has never held 
public office. That does not 
mean he can relate to most 
Americans or will be able to 
implement policies that benefit 
the majority of Americans. 
Trump was born wealthy; he 
has lived in an ivory tower for 
all his life and hasn’t taken 
much interest in the lives of 
others until recently.

The man you elected is 

hilariously 
unqualified 
to 

be president. Honestly, why 
would you give the presidency 
to someone with absolutely 
no experience? By that logic, 
if I need surgery I should just 
overlook all the surgeons with 
years of experience and ask a 
random rich guy to carry out 
the operation.

I feel as though I have no 

choice but to give Donald 
Trump a chance since he won 
the election. I cannot scream “I 
object” while he takes the oath 
of office and expect that to stop 
anything. But I also cannot 
look at his presidency with an 
open mind when his statements 
and actions show that he is a 
self-serving, racist and sexist 
man. Telling me to give him a 
chance is like telling me “don’t 
knock it until you try it” about 
something that I know I detest.

S

ometimes, after spending 
months at a time nestled 
in the liberal enclave of 

Ann Arbor, I forget that my 
hometown is representative of 
a demographic that dismisses 
my 
political 

views as complete 
garbage. Moreover, 
if I had bothered to 
interact with that 
demographic 
at 

all — I mean really 
tapped 
into 
their 

economic anxieties 
and 
understood 

their 
desire 
for 

dramatic 
political 

change — I probably 
would have seen the 
events of 2016 coming from a 
mile away. But I didn’t, so it 
was just as much of a surprise 
to me as it was to everyone else.

I came to this realization the 

other day, after being tattooed 
by a Trump supporter.

Our conversation began the 

second I swung my legs onto 
his massive leather chair. He 
asked where I had gotten my 
other tattoos done, and I told 
him that I had gone to a few 
shops around town and one in 
Ann Arbor, to which he replied, 
“That’s pretty far.”

We were in Center Line, 

about 45 minutes from campus. 
It was familiar territory — a 
sister city of my hometown.

I explained that I live and go 

to school in Ann Arbor, which 
prompted him to ask my major 
(political science), and my 
career goals (“Do you want to 
be a politician or something?” 
“Fuck no, I don’t.”)

It was a natural progression 

from there, so eager to jump off 
the tips of our tongues as it has 
been for everyone for the last 
month: 

“What do you think of 

Trump?”

Quick disclaimer: It’s always 

a good rule of thumb to avoid 
talking politics with someone who 
is steadily drilling a needle into 
your skin — just as you would with, 
say, a hairdresser or your distant 

relatives. 
But 
this 

time, the conversation 
seemed inevitable and 
a little urgent.

I 
winced 
as 
he 

sterilized his tools and 
arranged the ink in 
front of him.

“I’m not a fan,” I 

said.

He went to work, 

both of us speaking 
over the buzz of the 
needle at this point. 

I glanced down to make sure 
he wasn’t drawing a penis or 
writing “capitalism rulezzz” on 
my arm or something. We were 
all good.

“Did you vote for Hillary, then?” 

he asked, tracing the outline of the 
design above my elbow.

“Yeah,” I replied.
“She’s so corrupt, though.”
“She wasn’t perfect.”
No use in poking the bear. 

Onward.

Our discussion lasted, in 

total, about half an hour. 
It moved from our favorite 
presidents (his was Reagan, 
mine was FDR), to socialism 
(“I’ve never seen a socialist 
country thrive like America 
has”), to Steve Bannon (“Yeah, 
that pick threw me for a loop.”)

I explained that you can love 

your country and still work 
diligently to improve it. He didn’t 
buy it.

He 
explained 
that 
the 

billionaires in Trump’s cabinet 
became so wealthy because they 
were experts in their field. I didn’t 
buy it.

By the time he had finished, 

neither of us had convinced the 
other of anything.

We exchanged pleasantries, 

and that was that.

I toggled with the message 

of this column for a while, 
spending 
some 
hasty 

paragraphs 
marveling 
at 

the humanity of the average 
Trump supporter. In the end, 
it felt too contrived. The notion 
that Trump supporters are 
people is not a breakthrough 
discovery, after all.

There is something to be said 

about the qualities that drew 
people to Donald Trump — the 
anti-establishment 
rhetoric, 

the businessman mentality, the 
crudeness that is so often mistaken 
for honesty. I could spend pages 
speculating about what these 
people thought the president-elect 
would do for them, how he would 
help. But this isn’t a think piece, and 
if I’m being honest with myself, my 
geographic proximity to working-
class Trump supporters doesn’t 
make me an expert. In fact, after 
spending years putting distance 
between myself and them, and 
having so fundamentally diverged 
in our ideologies, I can hardly 
claim to share their experiences 
anymore.

“OK, go look in the mirror,” 

he finally ordered, wiping the 
blood and ink away with a 
cloth.

I crossed the room to admire 

his work.

“You think you’ll come back 

here for your next tattoo?”

I nodded and handed him a 

tip as he wrapped my arm in 
plastic.

“Who knows,” he called as 

I turned to leave, “Trump’s so 
unpredictable, he could be the 
best president we’ve ever had 
or the worst.”

“I guess we’ll discuss it next 

time,” I replied.

Consistent inclusivity needed

ORGANIZATIONAL AND COMMUNITY MULTICULTURAL PRAXIS LAB | OP-ED

T

he 
recent 
election 

of Donald Trump as 
president-elect 
of 
the 

United States has re-opened a 
discourse on the state of race 
and racism in our country. 
Instances of police brutality 
continue to dominate television 
headlines, online news outlets 
and social media feeds. This fall, 
racist messages appeared on the 
campuses of Eastern Michigan 
University and the University 
of Michigan. And, very specific 
to the experiences of Latina/o 
individuals, our president-elect 
has vowed to deport millions of 
undocumented people and build 
a wall along the U.S.-Mexico 
border — plans that don’t seem 
all that outrageous considering 
the 2012 Arizona v. United States 
ruling that allowed for racial 
profiling and plans that have 
prompted concerned students 
to urge the University to declare 
itself a “sanctuary campus.”

The University, and the state 

of Michigan as a whole, has a 
predominantly 
Black-white 

narrative when it comes to race. 
However, Latina/o communities 
have grown at the University 
since the late 20th century. 
Though the Latina/o student 
population at the University of 
Michigan has increased over 
the past 20 years, it still rests at 
just more than 5 percent. As this 
population continues to grow — 
both at the University and across 
the country — we need to broaden 
our conversations about race and 
campus climate to include a more 
diverse group of people.

Qualitative 
data 
from 
the 

2014 Latina/o Campus Climate 
Survey revealed that a majority 
of Latina/o University students 
experience 
racism 
on 
our 

campus. In fact, 59.3 percent of 
Latina/o respondents reported 
negative experiences based on 
their identity. One student wrote: 
“The hostility and unwelcoming 
behaviors 
I 
experienced 
is 

something I do not wish upon 
anyone. It is already hard enough 
having moved away from home, 
and when all I wanted to do is 
make friends and meet people, 
these experiences are among 
those that made me question 
whether I will ever fit in.”

Latina/o respondents said they 

most 
commonly 
experienced 

microaggressions, followed by 

racism and isolation. Thirty-one 
percent of all those surveyed felt 
these negative experiences had 
affected their ability to continue 
in 
their 
academic 
program. 

Seven percent explicitly stated 
having had serious thoughts 
about 
terminating 
their 

studies. Importantly, students 
reported 
negative 
comments 

and experiences from faculty, 
staff and other students. If the 
University wants to improve 
the campus climate for Latina/o 
students, 
the 
administration 

should commit to making some 
serious changes.

Perhaps some of the issues 

experienced by Latina/o students 
at the University would be 
resolved if the number of Latina/o 
students, faculty and staff were 
to increase. Unfortunately, due 
to the 2003 Supreme Court 
case Gratz v. Bollinger, the 
University is prohibited from 
using affirmative action in its 
admissions decisions. Even so, 
there are alternative mechanisms 
that the University could use 
to improve the campus climate 
for Latina/o students and other 
students of color. At St. Cloud 
State University in Minnesota, 
for example, students, faculty 
and staff are encouraged to take 
advantage of diversity training 
opportunities on campus.

Although the University has 

a number of student groups 
available for Latina/o students, 
the 2014 study suggested that 
many students were not aware 
of these groups or the events 
they put on.

Visibility for these groups 

may create more feelings of 
inclusion on campus. Through 
access to student demographic 
information from the Office 
of 
Admissions, 
the 
Office 

of 
Academic 
Multicultural 

Initiatives 
and 
Multi-Ethnic 

Student Affairs are at a strategic 
position 
to 
assist 
incoming 

Hispanic 
students 
and 
the 

various 
student 
groups 
by 

channeling 
information 
on 

organizations, 
events 
and 

programs during orientation 
events, to faculty advisers and 
to students directly.

The University could also take 

steps to improve its accessibility 
for Latina/o students. At the 
University of North Carolina 
at Chapel Hill, students with 

a family income at or below 
200 percent of the federal 
poverty line are guaranteed 
enough 
scholarships 
and 

grants (possibly supplemented 
by work-study) that they are 
able to graduate from college 
debt-free. By adopting a tuition 
structure of this nature, the 
University would likely attract 
and retain a more diverse 
student 
population. 
Further, 

the University has extended 
in-state 
tuition 
benefits 
to 

undocumented undergraduate 
students. Extending these tuition 
benefits to all undocumented 
graduate students would help 
to ease the financial burden 
experienced by some Latina/o 
graduate students.

We are at (another) pivotal 

moment in the University’s 
history. 
Twenty-seven 
years 

ago, 
a 
strategic 
initiative 

called The Michigan Mandate 
(brought about by heightened 
racial 
tension 
and 
student 

protests sparked by hate crimes 
including racist fliers posted 
around 
campus) 
attempted 

to recruit and support a more 
diverse student body, faculty 
and staff. Since then, Supreme 
Court 
cases 
like 
Gratz 
v. 

Bollinger have detracted from 
improvements brought about 
by The Michigan Mandate and 
made race-targeted admissions 
practices illegal in the state. 
At the same time, Fisher v. 
University of Texas at Austin 
affirms the fact that striving 
for a diverse student body 
and seeking the educational 
benefits associated with that 
diversity 
should 
remain 
a 

priority in our country.

Last fall, under University 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel, 

a 
new 
strategic 
initiative 

was 
launched. 
While 
this 

initiative 
incorporates 
some 

of the suggestions from other 
universities, 
uncertainty 

remains. Will it be effective? Is 
another strategic initiative what 
we need, or is it a Band-Aid that 
will fall off in another 20 years?

Wolverines capture first B1G victory against Penn State

Redshirt sophomore forward 
DJ Wilson spent what seemed 
like an eternity suspended in 
mid-air, but 
when 
he 
came down 
to 
earth, 
he had an alley-oop pass from 
senior guard Derrick Walton 
Jr. in his hands. Slamming it 
home with authority, Wilson 
gave the Wolverines a 61-60 lead 
with just under three and a half 
minutes left on the clock and 
sent the Crisler Center crowd 
into a frenzy.
Wilson’s 
dunk 
put 
an 
exclamation mark at the end of 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team’s 20-6 run, in which the 
Wolverines roared all the way 
back from a 13-point deficit to 
take their first lead since the 
16-minute mark of the first half.
“As a point guard, I remember 
a lot of plays, and that one I 
think was probably the most 
ecstatic Crisler has gotten for 
us,” Walton said. “It was such 
a big play because of the way it 
happened and the run we (were) 
on.”
A 
chaotic 
end-of-game 
sequence ensued, but with clutch 
performances from Walton and 
fellow senior captain Zak Irvin, 
Michigan managed to hold on 
to beat Penn State, 72-69, for its 
first Big Ten win of the season.
In 
the 
remaining 
three 
minutes, the Wolverines (1-1 
Big Ten, 10-4 overall) kept 
trying to put the game away, but 
the Nittany Lions wouldn’t go 
down with a fight. Irvin hit two 
tough jump shots and Walton 
knocked down both of his free 
throws, but Penn State (1-2, 
9-7) answered back with a trey 

to close the lead to two with 46 
seconds left on the clock.
Walton responded with two 
more free throws, but another 
Nittany Lion three made it a 
one-point game with just five 
seconds left. Irvin finally sealed 
the deal with two more free 
throws to give Michigan its 
winning score of 72-69, as Penn 
State’s half-court buzzer-beater 
attempt fell short.
“Our seniors, who were not 
on their ‘A’ game, were certainly 
nothing short of spectacular in 
those last five minutes,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“They made the foul shots, they 
made the big plays, they threw 
the (alley-oop), they did a lot of 
great things.”
The Wolverines fell behind 
early in the contest, struggling 
to generate an offensive push 
throughout the first half. They 
shot just 42.3 percent from the 
floor and went 1-for-9 from 
3-point range. Outside of Wilson 
and sophomore forward Moritz 
Wagner, who scored eight and 
seven points, respectively, in the 
first half, Michigan looked lost 
on the offensive side of the ball.
Michigan 
continuously 
settled for forced shot after 
forced shot, leaving coach John 
Beilein visibly frustrated on the 
sideline. The lack of movement 
around the perimeter and the 
lack of penetration by the ball 
handlers cost the Wolverines 
multiple 
opportunities 
to 
develop any sort of rhythm. 
Those struggles were only 
amplified at the other end of the 
court, as Penn State had its way 
in the paint. The Nittany Lions 
— particularly forward Lamar 
Stevens, who had 13 points in 
the first half alone — sliced 
through Michigan’s defense at 
will. The Wolverines missed 

several defensive assignments, 
giving Penn State a number of 
clear looks at the basket.
“They drove us where they 
wanted to in the first half, and 
we let them,” Beilein said. “We 
were not physical defensively 
at all in the first half. Our 
starting five is not a physical 
team 
defensively. 
We 
must 
become that. … That’s the only 
way you’re gonna survive at this 
level.”
The Nittany Lions took a 
36-29 lead into the locker room 
at the half, but it could have 
been much worse for Michigan 
had it not been for Penn State’s 
seven turnovers — off of which 

the Wolverines scored eight 
points. 
Michigan 
made 
multiple 
attempts to put itself back into 
the game in the second half, 
with Wagner acting as the 
main catalyst of the comeback 
effort. 
In 
rapid 
succession, 
the sophomore made a tough 
layup, forced an over-and-back 
violation, and knocked down a 
3-pointer to shrink Penn State’s 
lead to just two with 17:42 left in 
the frame.
But 
the 
Nittany 
Lions 
answered right back, as forward 
Mike Watson imposed his will 
in the paint while catalyzing the 
offense on the perimeter. His 

teammates reaped the benefits, 
sinking three straight 3-pointers 
to open up a 14-point lead.
When it looked as though 
hope might be lost, with some 
Michigan fans beginning to 
head toward the exits, redshirt 
junior guard Duncan Robinson 
emerged 
with 
five 
straight 
points, including one of his 
trademark 3-pointers, to reduce 
the lead to eight.
“Duncan got a quick five, and 
it was down to eight,” Irvin said. 
“... It changed the whole game. 
All the momentum swung our 
way and at that point, we really 
just took off with the game.”
That 20-6 run, from the 11:22 

minute mark to the 3:28 minute 
mark — which Robinson ignited 
and Wilson emphatically ended 
— made all the difference in 
a game the Wolverines could 
easily have lost. Instead, they 
found a way to win, and to top 
it all off, they gave Beilein the 
200th victory of his Michigan 
career.
“We just thanked him and 
he thanked us,” Walton said. 
“We’ve won a lot of games 
together, and we’re just proud of 
him, happy for him. He’s a great 
coach, future Hall of Famer in 
my opinion, and he deserves 
every bit of it. He’s worked 
really hard to get where he is.”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Thome serves as sign 
of Michigan’s identity

The 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball team is familiar with 
the added intensity of Big Ten 
basketball.
After a solid 9-3 start to non-
conference play in the 2015-16 
season, the Wolverines faltered, 
going just 8-10 against conference 
foes and narrowly missing the 
NCAA Tournament.
This 
year, 
Michigan 
had 
another hot start. It went 11-3 in 
non-conference play this season 
and hopes to improve upon its Big 
Ten record from a year prior. It 
already has two double-digit wins 
against 
conference 
basement 
dwellers Rutgers and Wisconsin.
But upcoming games against 
top-25 teams like Maryland and 
Ohio State may paint a clearer 
picture of the kind of team that 
the Wolverines really are. But 
sophomore center Hallie Thome’s 
promising play in her first two Big 
Ten games this season revealed 
two completely different styles of 
play that Michigan can execute at 
a high level.
Against the Scarlet Knights, 
Thome was quiet but efficient. 
The 6-foot-5 center posted 10 
points and five rebounds, with 
most of the offensive damage 
coming 
from 
the 
long-range 
shooting of freshman guard Kysre 
Gondrezick and junior guard 
Katelynn Flaherty.
It wasn’t the most noteworthy 
outing for Thome, but just four 
days later, she flipped the script.
Thome had a career game 
against the Badgers on New Year’s 
Day, registering 37 points on 
13-for-15 shooting and 14 boards 
as Michigan cruised to an easy 
win. Even though Wisconsin had 
the height to match Thome — with 
five players over 6-foot-2 — she 
still managed to have her way 
down low and tally over half of the 
Wolverines’ 73 points.
Her dominance also improved 
her season totals to 14.6 points 
and 6.9 rebounds per game, and 
earned Thome her first career Big 

Ten Player of the Week honor.
“(Thome) 
ran 
the 
floor 
extremely well in transition,” 
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “She has such great hands 
and such great touch around the 
basket. She hadn’t had a game like 
that yet this season (or even) in her 
career. ... She was an incredible 
player.”
This Michigan team is known 
for its outside shooting. It is 
seventh in the country in 3-point 
field goal percentage (40.5) and 
has three effective scoring guards 
in its starting lineup. But Thome’s 
timely performance revealed that 
the Wolverines have the capability 
to be not just a threat beyond the 
arc, but all over the court.
According to Barnes Arico, 
her team’s offensive efficiency 
and Thome’s outburst can be 
attributed to putting Gondrezick 
in the lineup, who has been able 
to spread the floor and prevent 
double teams on often-targeted 
players like Flaherty and Thome.
Thome’s offensive onslaught 
also provided assurance that 
Michigan’s depth could rival 
more competitive teams. Even 
with four players in foul trouble 
— including Thome — going into 
halftime against the Badgers, the 
Wolverines still found a way to 
make adjustments and score 73 
points.
“The third quarter seems to 
be our quarter this year,” Barnes 
Arico said. “In both league games 
so far, we’ve been able to adjust. 
It’s taken a little bit of time, but in 
the third quarter we’ve been able 
to take advantage of opponents.”
Sixteen games into the season, 
and with one of its best starts 
in program history, it seems 
that Michigan is finally starting 
to form its identity. And to the 
misfortune of opposing teams, 
that identity is rooted in its 
circumstantial 
malleability 
— 
Michigan is able to modify its play 
to match the conditions of a game. 
But the question that remains to 
be answered is if it can do it right 
after tipoff, before its tougher 
conference games get out of hand.

Michigan seniors step up in crunch time

At the under-12 minute media 
timeout during the second half, 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team found itself down 12 with 
a Penn State one-and-one free 
throw opportunity coming.
The 
Wolverines 
huddled 
around senior wing Zak Irvin, 
who repeated over and over 
that Michigan wasn’t going to 
fall short and drop to 0-2 in the 
Big Ten.
“Our 
emotional 
leaders 
said we’re not going to lose 
this 
game,” 
said 
redshirt 
sophomore forward DJ Wilson. 
“(Michigan) 
coach 
(John 
Beilein) drew up some great 
plays for Duncan (Robinson) 
and he knocked them down. … 
From there on out, we had all of 
the momentum.”
Beilein then intervened in the 
timeout before play resumed 
and drew up a play to get his 
3-point 
specialist 
Robinson 
open.

The Wolverines (1-1 Big Ten, 
10-4 overall) ran the play on 
the ensuing possession, getting 
Robinson open for an open 
jump shot.
Michigan quickly got the 
ball back the following play 
and found Robinson open again 
behind the arc. Robinson hit 
the shot to close 
the 
deficit 
to 
seven 
as 
the 
Wolverines 
came 
roaring 
back 
to 
win, 
72-69, 
against 
the 
Nittany 
Lions (1-2, 9-7) 
at Crisler Center 
on 
Wednesday 
night.
“The 
team 
really looks for the seniors, 
especially Derrick (Walton Jr.) 
and myself, especially during 
those moments,” Irvin said. “I 
knew something needed to be 
said to be able to motivate our 
guys and light the fire under us. 
I’m happy it worked.”

Added 
Beilein: 
“I 
didn’t 
have to say anything. The 
(players) were all charged up 
and extremely upset with each 
other. I didn’t have to say a 
whole lot … and the rest took 
care of itself. We needed that.”
As 
Wilson 
mentioned, 
it 
was the seniors who led the 
huddle 
during 
the 
under-12 
timeout. 
But 
they 
also 
led 
out on the court 
with their play.
Besides 
an 
alley-oop 
dunk 
from 
Wilson 
that was assisted 
by Walton, the 
upperclassmen 
trio of Wilson, 
Walton and Robinson scored 
the 
majority 
of 
Michigan’s 
points in the final 12 minutes.
The two seniors — Walton 
and Irvin — especially, were key 
to the Wolverines’ victory down 
the stretch.
“Our seniors, who were not 

on their ‘A’ game, were certainly 
nothing short of spectacular in 
those last five minutes, ” Beilein 
said. “They made the foul shots, 
they made plays, they threw the 
(alley-oop). They did a lot of 
great things and committed to 
their defense.”
After putting up a combined 
stat line of six points, two 
boards and no assists in the first 
half, the duo changed course, 
finishing the second half with 
a combined 22 points, eight 
rebounds and six assists.
“We knew we had to make 
adjustments (at half),” Irvin 
said.
It was a similar performance 
to Michigan’s last game against 
Iowa on New Year’s Day, when 
the Wolverines lost an 86-83 
heartbreaker in overtime.
In Iowa City, the duo also 
combined for 22 points in the 
second half and overtime after 
Walton mustered just three 
points in the first half. Irvin 
didn’t fare much better against 
the Hawkeyes, as he was held 
scoreless in the first frame.
But Wednesday, while the 
trend was the same, the result 
was different — the Wolverines 
escaped with a victory on the 
back of timely shooting from 
their most experienced players.
It’s 
an 
encouraging 
sign 
from a team that seemingly 
plays better when its emotional 
leaders shoot well.
“It’s everything (when the 
seniors 
are 
playing 
well),” 
Wilson said. “It’s big time. 
They’re our leaders vocally, and 
they lead by example. So when 
we see them getting it going at 
the end like they did at the end 
of the second half, it changes 
everything.”
The question now is if the 
seniors can string together a 
complete game — something 
they proved they could do in 
New York City — on a consistent 
basis.
If 
they 
can, 
Thursday 
night showed Michigan has a 
favorable Big Ten slate ahead 
of it.

Wolverines energized from 
annual trip to South Florida

The 
Michigan 
men’s 
swimming and diving team has 
spent the last week in Florida, 
training and preparing for the 
next stretch of its season. 
With important Big Ten 
meets against Indiana, Ohio 
State 
and 
Michigan 
State 
coming up in the next month, 
the trip to the Sunshine State 
was a worthwhile change for 
the 12th-ranked Wolverines.
The trip, which is an annual 
tradition for both the men’s 
and women’s teams, provides 
them with the opportunity to 
split time between training and 
enjoying the break from school.
Senior 
Jack 
Mangan 
emphasized that the team used 
the opportunity to energize 
and prepare for the upcoming 
season. 
“We’re 
excited,” 
Mangan 
said. “That was such a good 
block of training for everyone. 
You need guys who really 
believe in what they’re doing.”
The team made sure to leave 
time to build chemistry on dry 

land, outside of the many hours 
spent in the pool. Mangan — a 
two-time NCAA All-American 
and two-time Big Ten champion 
— emphasized that swimming 
is a tough sport, in which good 
team chemistry is integral to 
having a successful season.
“The culture is moving in a 
positive 
direction,” 
Mangan 
said. “The trip was a great 
bonding experience.”
The 
Wolverines 
are 
coming off a handful of solid 
performances during the fall. 
But their most recent outing 
was the Georgia Invitational 
in early December, where they 
finished sixth out of seven.
Michigan 
coach 
Mike 
Bottom said the trip to Florida 
was a great opportunity to 
build on what had been working 
well during the fall, while 
also emphasizing the bonding 
aspect of the trip.
“We had some great training 
sets,” he said. “We watched 
swimmers get better.” 
Michigan capped off its trip 
by taking part in the Orange 
Bowl Classic in Key Largo, Fla. 
on Jan. 3.

The Wolverines won the 
competition, 
championing 
11 out of 12 individual races, 
with senior Vinny Tafuto and 
freshman Jacob Montague each 
winning two events. Tafuto 
won the 50-meter butterfly 
and 
100-meter 
butterfly, 
with Montague winning the 
50-meter breaststroke and the 
100-meter breaststroke.
Michigan finished first with 
275 points, beating Texas A&M, 
George Mason and Middlebury.
The Wolverines also won 
the two team relays during the 
tournament, finishing first in 
both the 200-meter medley and 
the 200-meter freestyle. 

Michigan’s 
solid 

performance at the tournament 
should give it good momentum 
and confidence heading into 
the next few months. 
Mangan said he and his 
fellow Wolverines were both 
excited and motivated from the 
trip to Florida.
His message was simple: 
“We’re coming in with fire in 
our bellies and ready to fight for 
Michigan.”

WOMEN’S SWIMMING AND DIVING
Michigan dominates at 
Orange Bowl Classic

It was New Year’s Eve, and the 
Michigan women’s swimming 
and diving team returned to the 
water. Only this time, the sixth-
ranked Wolverines were on a 
boat in the Gulf of Mexico, ready 
to ring in 2017 with each other.
Dipping and dodging stray 
sparks, Michigan enjoyed the 
holiday’s firework show and an 
evening off, all while knowing 
practice would be later the next 
morning.
It was the team’s annual 
training trip to the Florida Keys, 
allowing the athletes to relax 
while continuing to prepare for 
arguably the most important leg 
of the season — 
three Big Ten 
dual 
meets, 
as well as the 
conference 
and 
NCAA 
Championships.
The 
trip, 
Michigan coach 
Mike 
Bottom 
specified, 
was 
not 
only 
to 
improve 
in the water but also to bond 
and celebrate the Wolverines’ 
success in the classroom. To 
do so, Michigan took a break 
from its books and backstrokes 
for a beach day. Ironically, no 
swimming 
was 
involved 
— 
only wading and some minor 
splashing ensued. 
Most of the trip, though, was 
spent in the water practicing.
With two available pools, 
the Wolverines had eight hours 
of available training facilities 
each day, typically clocking in 
two four-hour sessions. Though 
strenuous, 
Michigan 
quickly 

reaped the benefits of the 
intensive training in the Orange 
Bowl Classic on Jan. 3 in Key 
Largo, Fla. at the culmination of 
the trip.
“We broke the meet record 
in almost every event,” said 
senior Madison Horton. “It was 
awesome.”
And 
it 
was 
not 
an 
exaggeration. The Wolverines 
came in first place among the six 
teams competing, winning all 12 
events and setting meet records 
in nine of them. 
Four 
Michigan 
swimmers 
came out on top in multiple 
events, 
including 
sophomore 
Siobhán Haughey (100-meter 
freestyle, 
200-meter 
IM), 
freshman 
Vanessa 
Krause 
(50-meter 
butterfly, 
100-
meter butterfly) 
and 
juniors 
Clara 
Smiddy 
(50-meter 
backstroke, 
100-meter 
backstroke) and 
Emily 
Kopas 
(50-meter 
breaststroke, 
100-meter 
breaststroke).
“That’s how they learn to be 
champions,” Bottom said. “They 
go into these opportunities to 
race, and they figure out how to 
get better.”
And get better, they did.
“It’s a team thing,” Bottom 
said. “They help each other and 
push each other as individuals. 
That’s why this team does so 
well, because they have bonded 
not only in the pool, but outside 
in the classroom and in the 
community. That’s what helps 
them to understand what being 
a champion is all about.”

After midseason wake-up call, Kile finally
increasing his production for the Wolverines

It had been an ignominious 
period for the Michigan hockey 
team. After taking an early lead 
in the first period, the Wolverines 
allowed Wisconsin to score five 
goals in the second to take a 
commanding 6-3 lead. Michigan 
was on the ropes, desperate for a 
solution to the Badgers’ onslaught.
They wouldn’t find one from 
senior forward Alex Kile. Kile 
checked a Wisconsin player from 
behind as the second period came 
to a close, earning him a game 
misconduct while forcing his team 
to kill a five-minute power play.
“I knew he was frustrated, but 
he’s just got to contain that,” said 
Michigan coach Red Berenson. 
“It wasn’t a vicious hit. In fact, 
it didn’t even have to be called 
a penalty. But it just looked bad 
for your leading scorer to put 
your team in that situation, and 
I told Alex, ‘That’s part of your 
learning process ... self-control 
and understanding (you’ve) been 
through this before and (you’re) 
not going to let (yourself) get 
caught up in it.’ ”
Added Kile: “(Berenson) was 
pretty mad at me, and he let 
me know about it. I’m always a 
player that responds positively to 
a negative situation. (Berenson’s) 
gotten on me in the past, and I feel 
like the next game I’ve always been 
a pretty good player. … It’s okay if 
he yells at me, because he knows I 
can take it, and I feel like I respond 
well to those kind of things.”
The misconduct penalty was 
perhaps the low point of what had 
been a long season up until that 
point for Kile, who came into the 
year carrying the burden of being 
both the team’s leading returning 
scorer and one of its captains.
Both were roles Kile had 
anticipated taking on as soon as 
several of his former teammates 
announced 
they 
would 
be 
leaving early for the NHL. Over 

the offseason, he worked on 
becoming a more vocal leader 
— 
Kile 
previously 
described 
himself as being a more quiet kid 
in the locker room — while also 
training extensively to increase 
his stamina.
By the time the season rolled 
around, Berenson noticed the 
senior’s offseason effort, going on 
the record multiple times to praise 
Kile. It was especially gratifying 
for 
him 
to 
hear 
Berenson’s 
comments after he had worked to 
steadily improve each season since 
arriving in Ann Arbor.
“I came in as a freshman and 
didn’t really play that much,” Kile 
said. “I’ve proved myself ever 
since the beginning of sophomore 
year, so it’s definitely something 
that I’ve earned but it’s something 
that I’m not taking for granted. 
For someone like Red to give you 
compliments like that, it means a 
lot just being who he is.”
Despite all the preparation and 
praise, though, Kile — and the 
rest of his team — limped out the 
gate. He struggled to turn strong 
play into production, going on four 
and seven-game goal droughts, all 
while his team stumbled to a 7-8-1 
start through the first half of the 
season.
“(Kile) really felt that this was 
not necessarily his team, but this 
was his time,” Berenson said. 
“He’d been part of a high-scoring 
machine last year, but when we 
lost all of those guys, now he 
looks around and it’s just him. He 
embraced that.
“I can’t tell you it’s gone smooth 
for him — I think it’s been a 
challenge. Maybe he hasn’t had 
the supporting cast. He was 
playing with two freshmen for 
the first number of games, and 
playing pretty well but not playing 
as consistently and productively as 
he would like, or that I would like.”
Kile reminisced about playing 
on the same line last season with 
two seniors in Boo Nieves and 
Justin Selman, who he called 

“proven” and “mature” players. 
Kile believed the trio had a natural 
swagger that made it easy for them 
to score, whereas this year, he 
thinks the entire team is having 
trouble finding that same type of 
confidence — thus struggling to 
produce.
Meanwhile, 
Berenson 
felt 
that Kile, burdened by high 
expectations, was pressing too 
much on the ice and becoming 
frustrated — something which 
only 
compounded 
the 
issue, 
occasionally 
leading 
to 
bad 
penalties like the misconduct 
against Wisconsin.
Though his penalty hurt the 
team in the short term, it may 
end up helping Michigan in the 
long run. Kile referred to it as a 
“wake-up call,” especially after his 
conversation with Red.
That 
has 
certainly 
been 
reflected in his play in the three 
games since: after tallying just 
two goals in his first 14 games 
played, Kile now has three in as 
many games, scoring once against 
Wisconsin and twice against 
Michigan State in the Great Lakes 
Invitational. The recent uptick 

has coincided with the return 
of sophomore forward Cooper 
Marody from a suspension — 
Marody has played on the first line 
with Kile for the past two games 
and assisted on both of Kile’s goals 
against the Spartans.
“It’s obviously not the first half 
of the season I wanted or our team 
wanted — I think every individual 
on our team can say that,” Kile 
said. “I just feel like with (Marody) 
back, it’s a clean slate. He’s a player 
that I wanted to play with at the 
beginning of the year and then he 
(was) ineligible. We aspire to do 
big things — we talk about it all the 
time — and I think we are going to 
be two of the better players in the 
Big Ten in the second half of the 
season.”
Added 
Berenson: 
“We 
put 
(Marody) and (Kile) together, 
and I think they’re going to get 
something going here. It was good 
to see (Kile) get a couple against 
Michigan State. In the meantime, 
he’s playing hard and he hasn’t 
lost a beat. I don’t think he’s got 
discouraged over all this. I think 
he just got more convinced that 
he’s gotta do it.”

Best Student Productions of 2016
1. Peter and the 

Starcatcher

Michigan’s 
theatre 

department took on a new 
challenge this season with their 
performance of “Peter and the 
Starcatcher.” As the prequel to 
the famous story of “Peter Pan,” 
the Tony-award-winning play 
performed at the Power Center 
this past December. What made 
this show stand out among 
other 
SMTD 
performances 

was the unique adversity the 
theatre department faced, as a 
musical it is a departure from 
their 
typical 
lineup 
(other 

recent productions include “The 
Arabian Nights” and “Henry IV, 
Part I”). Yet, even with a small 
pit band, continuous musical 
scores 
and 
dance 
numbers, 

the theatre department did a 
fantastic job adapting to the 
musical 
performance 
style. 

This production involved cross 

departmental 
collaboration, 

like merging lighting, props and 
costuming for certain scenes. 
The immense effort put into 
rehearsals was definitely shown 
in the performance as the cast 
and crew worked seamlessly in 
set changes and effects. “Peter 
and the Starcatcher” answered 
questions that I’ve had lingering 
since I was a child. However, 
it taught me more than just 
how Tinker Bell came to be. 
This 
show 
exemplified 
the 

concept of taking chances and 
constantly seeking something 
out of our comfort zone. It’s for 
that audacious kid that is still 
deep within all of us, itching to 
experience one more journey 
while we are still young.

— ERIKA SHEVCHEK 

3. Roméo et Juliette

SMTD’s 
production 
of 

Roméo et Juliette was cre-
ative, entertaining and pow-
erful. Staged in the 1950s, 
world-famous director Paul 
Curran aligned the story of 
“Roméo et Juliette” with the 
radicalism of the modern era. 
Through this decision, Cur-
ran brought out the intensity 
of how Romeo and Juliette’s 
environment 
effected 
their 

decisions. 
The 
University’s 

Opera Theatre students were 

truly impressive; the striking 
professionalism 
blew 
audi-

ences away. The enthralling 
fight scenes and chemistry 
between the performers made 
for a convincing, incredible 
performance. With the relat-
able modern aspect of work-
ing 
through 
differences, 

combined with the modern 
setting, this production was 
unique and unforgettable.

Best Films of 2016

Filming 
a 
perfect 
hor-

ror movie is really hard, but 
filming one with none of the 
traditional elements of the 
genre, and without profes-
sional actors, and without a 
budget, is nothing short of 
Herculean. But Trey Edward 
Shults, by casting his entire 
family and using their home 
as a set, did just that with 
“Krisha.” With his aunt, Kri-
sha Fairchild, starring as the 
titular recovering alcoholic 
returning to her family for 
Thanksgiving, Shults created 

a masterful take on the terrors 
of family gatherings. Shults’s 
camera 
methodically 
soars 

in a contained space, stealth-
ily dropping in on characters 
to reveal their conversations. 
“Krisha” is at once lyrical and 
horrifying, that rare mixture 
of utter terror and beauty. And 
to accomplish that with next 
to no resources indicates a 
supremely bright career ahead

—DANIEL HENSEL

Daniel 
Radcliffe’s 

performance in “Swiss Army 
Man” might have been one of 
the best of 2016, but there are 
two other Daniels who deserve 
even more of the credit for this 
bizarre 
masterpiece: 
Daniel 

Scheinert 
and 
Dan 
Kwan, 

the collective “Daniels” who 
directed and wrote the film. 
After establishing themselves 
with a number of short films 
and music videos (like that 
famously 
weird 
video 
for 

“Turn Down for What”), the 
Daniels really made a name for 
themselves this year with their 

feature film debut, a gloriously 
indescribable fantasy-comedy-
drama … or something. “Swiss 
Army Man” feels so much 
like it comes from such a 
singular mind that it’s initially 
surprising to learn it was 
borne from collaboration. With 
any luck, the Daniels will be 
around for a long time, filling 
the coming years with movies 
at once hilarious and deeply 
moving.

— BEN ROSENSTOCK

1. “La La Land”

We are lucky to have movies 

in our lives, and “La La Land” 
is living proof. It’s a classic 
in the making, thanks to the 
star power of the magnetic 
Emma Stone (“Birdman”), the 
almost superhumanly charis-
matic Ryan Gosling (“The Nice 
Guys”), and the deft directorial 
hand of Damien Chazelle. The 
characters sing and dance their 
way into our hearts as we are 
immersed in a beautiful cin-
ematic world of primary colors, 
music, art, dreams, fears and 
love — so much love. In a year 
filled with cynicism, anger and 
so many mediocre and instant-

ly forgettable movies, “La La 
Land” is a breath of fresh air. It 
does exactly what a good story 
is supposed to do by carrying 
audiences on a complete emo-
tional journey, one devoid of 
any trickery, manipulation or 
shortcuts. “La La Land” is sin-
cere in a way that wasn’t sup-
posed to be possible anymore. 
But it is possible. Thank you, 
“La La Land.” You shine so very 
brightly.

— ASIF BECHER

As I get further away from it, 

I’m coming to respect “The Edge 
of Seventeen” more and more. 
It’s a thrilling return to form for 
that American staple — the com-
ing-of-age teen comedy — and 
the woman behind the camera 
is a major talent to be heralded. 
“Seventeen” is better written 
than it is directed, but Kelly 
Fremon Craig knows the qual-
ity of the script she’s written. 
It’s spiky, full of edgy jokes and 
elegantly constructed scenes of 
dialogue; take, for example, any 
of the scenes between Nadine 
and Mr. Bruner (a testament to 
Craig’s direction that she was 
able to coax this hilarious of 
a performance out of Woody 
Harrelson (“True Detective”)). 
Her choices are also nuanced; 
she conveys a remarkable facil-

ity with the subtleties of her 
characters, and it’s a monumen-
tal achievement — on both her 
part and that of Hailee Stein-
feld’s (“True Grit”) beautifully 
modulated performance — that 
Nadine is impressively irritat-
ing and heartbreakingly sympa-
thetic in equal measure. Really, 
it’s Craig’s ability to legitimately 
achieve emotional poignancy 
that imbues her work with an 
uncommon sense of urgency. 
If Craig is the spiritual succes-
sor to John Hughes, then I’ll be 
unspeakably happy. And if she 
chooses any other direction, 
I’ll be just as excited; rarely are 
feature debuts more emotion-
ally perceptive than this one, 
and rarely do they herald such a 
promising future.

— NABEEL CHOLLAMPAT

2. “Moonlight”

Though it challenges prevail-

ing conceptions of masculin-
ity, sexuality, poverty and race, to 
describe “Moonlight” in terms of 
symbolism or theme would be to 
misunderstand its beauty. At its 
heart, “Moonlight” is simple: It’s 
a story about Chiron, a black boy 
coming of age in Miami. Told in 
three parts, each titled after one 
of Chiron’s nicknames, the camera 
moves fluidly with its characters 
to paint a searing portrait of their 
inner lives. We see Chiron meek 
and small, tormented by bullies 
and bashfully approaching his first 
homosexual encounter. We see 
him ashamed and worried about 
his drug-addicted mother (Nao-
mie Harris, “Spectre”), finding a 

father figure in Juan (Mahershala 
Ali, “House of Cards”), a crack 
dealer who cares for him in his 
own home. We see Chiron older, 
bigger, growing different, staying 
the same.

It’s a refreshing and unflinch-

ing realism. There are no arcs of 
conclusion other than those initi-
ated by the characters themselves. 
The social commentary comes not 
by way of agenda, but from the 
reality of life. Rather than create 
characters to be vehicles for uni-
versal themes, “Moonlight” eludes 
generalization, choosing instead to 
step into Chiron’s life and make all 
of its facets visible.

— VANESSA WONG

2. The Drowsy Chaperone

Performed 
in 
the 
Lydia 

Mendelssohn theatre, SMTD’s 
musical theatre department 
did a wonderful job with their 
production of “The Drowsy 
Chaperone,” a hilarious and 
upbeat show set in the Roaring 
20s. The story follows an old, 
lonely man as he shares a vinyl 
record of his favorite musi-
cal — also titled “The Drowsy 
Chaperone” — with the audi-
ence and watches it come to 
life in his apartment. The cast 

and crew did an impeccable job 
with all aspects of the show, 
including elaborate sets and 
costumes, comedic timing and 
vocal harmonies. The show 
kicked off the musical theatre 
season wonderfully. A perfect 
mix of funny, lighthearted, 
sentimental and deep, it was 
the perfect show to lighten the 
mood. It will be worth watch-
ing what the musical theatre 
department presents this term.

Best New 
Directors 

of 

2016

3. “Manchester By The Sea”

In the grand tradition of “The 

Shawshank Redemption,” “Man-
chester by the Sea” is arguably 
the hardest film of the year to get 
through, yet it is also one of the 
most rewarding. Anchored by 
titanic lead performances from 
Casey Affleck (“Ain’t Them Bod-
ies Saint”) and Lucas Hedges 
(“Moonrise Kingdom”), the film 
is a mournful, achingly human 
study of grief and coping that is 
simultaneously funny, heartbreak-
ing and poignant. Director Ken-
neth Lonergan (“You Can Count 

on Me”) uses his newest movie to 
examine sorrow and life in a way 
that few do; there’s no classic cli-
max here, no concrete resolution 
— there’s only two people desper-
ately trying to navigate their rap-
idly changing circumstances, and 
the way Lonergan brings those 
characters and that struggle to 
life through flashbacks and humor 
reveals the director’s maturity and 
elevates “Manchester by the Sea” 
to masterpiece levels of filmmak-
ing.

— JEREMIAH VANDERHELM

4. “Arrival”

“Arrival” is surely the best 

science fiction movie of 2016. 
In a sort of linguistic mys-
tery, Amy Adams (“Nocturnal 
Animals”) and Jeremy Renner 
(“American 
Hustle”) 
must 

decipher the language of the 
“heptapod” aliens whom have 
landed their 12 ships across the 
Earth and discover their pur-
pose on our planet. Both actors 
deliver engaging performances 
that are highlights of the film. 
“Arrival” is not only visually 
entertaining in the way that 

any good science fiction movie 
should be, but thought-provok-
ing as well. After watching the 
movie, one can’t help but dis-
cuss the logic of the film with 
others, and its commentary on 
the role of language, politics 
and human society.

— JOSEPH WAGNER

1. Kelly Fremon Craig
2. Trey Edward Shults

3. Daniels (Scheinert, Kwan)
4. Robert Eggers

“The Witch” could be the most 

carefully made movie of the year. 
In preparation for filming, direc-
tor Robert Eggers painstakingly 
researched and recreated a Puri-
tan New England homestead using 
period-appropriate tools and mate-
rials. He could tell you the exact 
dimensions of the windows and 
how many candles you would need 
to light a room. All that research 
and precision (all five years of it) 
paid off for Eggers. “The Witch” 
is completely immersive. Eggers 
pulls his audience so deep into the 
world of the film that the horror 
unfolds in tiny moments all around 

us. It’s claustrophobic — a difficult 
feeling to create at the edge of the 
colonized world. The family has all 
the space they need and yet Eggers 
makes it feel as if they are on top of 
each other, and we on top of them. 
Eggers is working in a very old, but 
cinematically overlooked corner of 
horror. He’s walking in the world 
of Edgar Allen Poe and Mary Shel-
ley — heavy-velvet Gothic horror — 
and it’s wonderful. Eggers could be 
the director the genre needs to pull 
it back to its roots and propel it back 
to artistic relevance.

— MADELEINE GAUDIN

5. “The Lobster”

6. “Sing Street”

How does one describe the 

most idiosyncratic film of the 
year? “The Lobster” is what 
would happen if a bunch of aliens 
who had never been to Earth 
before made a documentary 
about modern human mating 
rituals. Dating, marriage and 
the single life are absolutely 
skewered 
by 
surrealist 

director 
Yorgos 
Lanthimos 

(“Dogtooth”), whose completely 
absurd sci-fi premise (if these 
singles can’t find a partner in 

45 days, they’re to be surgically 
transformed into an animal of 
their choosing) only obscures 
the much darker true subject of 
the film — the bizarre hurdles 
our species jumps through to 
engage with love and sex. Colin 
Farrell (“In Bruges”) roots this 
brilliant satire in a fascinatingly 
dry performance that he isn’t 
receiving nearly enough awards 
attention for.

— JACOB RICH

A high school boy becomes 

enamored with a girl and will do 
anything to win over her attrac-
tion. This plotline is just about as 
cliché as they get. Add a catchy 
New 
Wave-inspired 
original 

soundtrack, 
multidimensional 

characters and a heartwarming 
story, and the result is one of the 
most endearing coming-of-age 
movies in years. Irish filmmaker 
John Carney’s (“Once”) musical-
comedy tells the story of Cosmo 
Lawlor (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) and 
his goal to create a New Wave 
band in order to win over the heart 
of Raphina (Lucy Boynton, “Miss 
Potter”), an aspiring model. Cos-
mo’s band, surprisingly, performs 

many tracks that would blend in 
seamlessly on an ’80s radio sta-
tion. In the spirit of Duran Duran 
and other New Wave sensations, 
the soundtrack reintroduces what 
made New Wave so much fun — 
even if some of it hasn’t aged too 
well. Amidst family conflicts and 
bullies, Cosmo’s older brother, 
Brendan (Jack Reynor, “Trans-
formers: Age of Extinction”), is 
his driving force. “Sing Street” 
is as much about the music and 
romance as it is self-discovery and 
making sacrifices for loved ones, 
showing the complexities of ado-
lescence, family and love.

— WILL STEWART

5. Travis Knight

Stop-motion animation is 

one of the most complex and 
intricate cinematic art forms, 
and one of the most breath-
taking if done successfully. 
With his directorial debut 
“Kubo and the Two Strings,” 
stop-motion maestro Travis 
Knight demonstrates his mas-
tery of both technique and 
storytelling. The film follows 
the journey of young Kubo, as 
he fights to protect his fam-
ily’s honor while fulfilling 
his yearning for adventure. 
Knight’s brilliance is evident 
in the way in which he crafts 
the film’s animation to create 
a world built from origami — 
the film is constructed from 
folded paper-like segments 
that move together to create 

a cohesive and dynamic aes-
thetic. Knight also weaves 
Japanese mythology, tradi-
tion and ideals with West-
ern narrative techniques in a 
seamless fashion. A seasoned 
professional 
in 
the 
world 

of stop-motion, Knight has 
worked with the esteemed 
Laika Entertainment to head 
critically acclaimed projects 
like “Coraline” and “ParaNor-
man.” His directorial work 
on “Kubo,” however, sets him 
apart from other names in 
the industry as a director to 
watch; his work carries a force 
of creative innovation unseen 
in the previous hallmarks of 
stop-motion.

Add one cup of laughter, a 

pinch of funny people, three 
tablespoons of hilarity and 
what do you get? A recipe for 
fun and Midnight Book Club’s 
first show of the year. Midnight 
Book Club is one of the several 
improv troupes here on campus. 
They specialize in a specific 
type of improv called long form 
where the show is entirely 

made up on the spot and 
that scenes branch off of one 
another to continue jokes. The 
auditorium was buzzing with 
an air of contained excitement, 
and after watching this group, 
I can say I was certainly not 
disappointed. I was laughing 
out loud at all of the jokes made, 
and each member of the group 
was electric with energy and 

humor. Midnight Book Club is a 
group you do not want to miss 
this semester.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

“Formation” is an unabashed 

salute to the power of woman-
hood — more importantly, to 
the fortitude of Black, south-
ern 
womanhood. 
Partnered 

with the striking images in the 
music video of various Black 
women over time, the track 
transcends the confines of pop 
music and becomes an instance 
of protest. Bey is refusing to 
be limited by her race, place 
of birth or gender, and rallies 
against such boundaries with 
lyrics flaunting her wealth 
alongside her heritage.

“Formation” wraps social 

issues — police brutality, the 
disenfranchisement of women, 
regional and racial stereo-

types — in an alluring pop 
packaging. Lines like “I got 
hot sauce in my bag, swag” 
seem meaningless on the sur-
face, but, when preceded with 
“Earned all this money, but 
they never take the country 
out me,” become seeped in cul-
tural significance. This kind 
of nuanced wordplay, along 
with its undeniably infectious 
musicality, makes “Formation” 
one of 2016’s most important 
tracks. No wonder Beyoncé is 
called the Queen.

Best Singles of 2016

“Orange is the New Black” 

dropped arguably its best season 
this year, yet again managing to 
transition between gut-busting 
comedy and heartbreaking drama 
with ease. Subtly challenging the 
series’ own empathy-for-everyone 
creed, the fourth season gave us an 
honest depiction of prison privati-
zation and showed the potentially 
fatal consequences that can result 
from power structures built on 
racism, sexism and brutal dehu-
manization. Sexual assault, unjust 
solitary confinement, even murder 

— these are the threats the women 
of Litchfield Penitentiary face. 
While a controversial late-season 
death left audiences divided, the 
final episode paid tribute to the 
beloved character with an elegiac 
flashback sequence depicting a 
magical trip through Manhat-
tan. The season ended with a PR 
nightmare, a prison revolt and the 
most joyful, yet simultaneously 
most devastating final shot of TV 
in 2016.

— BEN ROSENSTOCK

3. “Orange is the New Black” 

I’ve never quite seen a show pull 

off the feat that “The Americans” 
has. The show made the jump from 
good to great between its first and 
second seasons, became one of the 
top shows on television in its third 
and somehow got even better in 
its fourth. The series follows an 
undercover Soviet spy couple living 
in America during the ’80s. With 
two kids and a travel agency, the 
live a seemingly normal life. This 
year’s episodes of “The Americans” 
pushed Philip and Elizabeth more 
than it ever has before. It contin-
ued to show how the rough nature 
of their lives affects those around 
them, including their daughter, 
Paige, who continues to be drawn 
into their secrets. Philip has to deal 
with Martha, an FBI secretary 
whom he “married” (under another 
name and hairstyle), as her role as an 

asset to the KGB becomes increas-
ingly dangerous. Really, though, the 
series is about Philip and Elizabeth. 
Matthew Rhys (“Brothers & Sis-
ters”) and Keri Russell (“Felicity”) 
continue to do amazing work por-
traying the couple, bringing their 
struggles with their roles as par-
ents, their relationship with their 
country and the difficulty of their 
work to life. Not only are the per-
formances and story strong, but the 
series also continues to be a master 
of the tension-and-release storytell-
ing method. It’s both deeply emo-
tional and nail-bitingly tense. The 
show has two more seasons left on 
its run, and if they’re anything like 
this year’s episodes, they’ll be must-
see television.

— ALEX INTNER

5. “The Americans”

“Game of Thrones” continu-

ously draws viewers further down 
the rabbit hole, and there was no 
exception in the explosive sixth 
season. The series took this past 
season as an opportunity to probe 
deeper into the politics of power 
and the devastating consequences 
of control. From start to finish, the 
sixth season pulls from these pil-
lars in a refreshing manner. And 
though the majority of the season 
focused on the silent power strug-
gle between King Tommen (Dean-
Charles Chapman, “Before I Go to 
Sleep”) and Cersei Lannister (Lena 
Headey, “The Purge”) in Westeros 
and the war between House Stark 
and Bolton in the North, “Game 
of Thrones” built an intricate web 

that hooked viewers with superb 
feats in acting and cinematography.

One of the greatest strengths 

of “Game of Thrones,” especially 
showcased in the sixth season, lays 
in its cast. With a compelling cast 
taking the reigns, it was nice to see 
“Game of Thrones” taking advan-
tage of their broad range of talents. 
For confirmation of the show’s 
genius in storytelling, one can look 
no further than the season finale, 
“The Winds of Winter.” nd many 
more this past year, that “Game of 
Thrones” succeeds in pushing the 
boundaries of television. Winter is 
finally here, and the cold has never 
been so promising.

— MEGAN MITCHELL

6. “Game of Thrones”

Before the pro-Trump rants 

and the Kim K drama and the 
hospitalization, there was a 
beam. It captivated and guid-
ed, but above anything else, 
the beam enveloped. On The 
Life of Pablo, an album with so 
much punch, it says something, 
a lot, to kick it all off with this 
sensitive admission of wrong-
doing. Well, it’s also somewhat 
of a plea for redemption. Or it’s 
both, and a lot more. It’s gor-
geous.

The organ! It stays ground-

ed in its sanctity. The choir!

Kanye has forced himself 

into a conversation of divinity 
in a manner only he could pull 
off. He wanted us to buy into 
this preaching, that he is a god, 
and we kind of did buy it. But 

now he’s the one most in need 
of a ride on the beam, simul-
taneously enticing others to 
revel in its benefits while not 
actually rapping.

The real rap belongs to 

Chance the Rapper, who deliv-
ers that verse — the one that 
miraculously and successfully 
conflates humble beginnings, 
earnest success, and pomp-
ousness. Bolstered by The-
Dream and prayers from Kelly 
Price and Kirk Franklin, the 
total product is a message that 
reverberates even for the most 
unholy. Desperate, devout, and 
fulfilling all at once, it’s com-
plete Kan-tharsis at its finest.

— JOEY SCHUMAN

1. “Ultralight Beam”

Kendrick Lamar

No song off Frank Ocean’s 

Blonde better epitomized the 
album’s surreal mass appeal 
than “Nikes.” It’s a slow, medi-
tative track that barely has 
a beat and features vocals 
pitched 
up 
beyond 
human 

range, but it managed to lead 
off one of the most talked-
about and beloved albums of 
the year.

“Nikes” contains all aspects 

of what makes Ocean so com-
pelling. 
It’s 
got 
the 
hazy 

cross-faded 
imagery, 
the 

detached-at-the-party 
vibe 

that has been part of Ocean’s 
arsenal since his early hit 
“Novacane,” but it also takes 
the time to pay respect to Pimp 
C, A$AP Yams and Trayvon 
Martin, as Ocean’s own mor-

tality looms over all the song’s 
thoughts and actions.

But he balances out “Nikes” 

with his underrated sense of 
humor. “You got a roommate 
he’ll hear what we do / It’s only 
awkward if you’re fucking him 
too,” is the now-famous clos-
ing line, but don’t sleep on the 
early couplet: “Said she need 
a ring like Carmelo / Must be 
on that white like Othello.” As 
sparse as it sounds at first lis-
ten, “Nikes” reveals something 
new each time you return to it, 
and it’s another tremendous 
accomplishment for one of our 
most multi-dimensional, enig-
matic modern pop stars.

5. “Pick Up the Phone” 
Young Thug ft. Travis Scott

There was much fanfare in 

the last year about the “tropical 
vibe.” It seethed less successful-
ly on some abrasive EDM tracks, 
brought Justin Bieber back to 
the radio (because, why not?) 
and soared on some of the year’s 
biggest songs.

Sometimes, though, trends 

work. “pick up the phone,” a col-
laboration between the distinc-
tive Young Thug and the notably 
less distinctive Travis Scott, is 
by far one of the best examples.

The 
production 
doesn’t 

scream “Look, we’re on an 
island!” but its influence is clear. 
It’s the Goldilocks principle at 

obvious play: not too much, not 
too little, but just right. Young 
Thug might occasionally sound 
the blabber of a baby, but it’s 
still perfect. Travis Scott yelps 
in background, but it’s still, you 
know, masterful. Everything 
just falls into place.

Also, it just happens to bang. 

Like, really, really bang. It 
warrants every replay, every 
screamed “I know you’re home 
baby!” I don’t care how many 
times you heard it in the base-
ment of that frat — “pick up the 
phone” is still one of the best 
songs of the year.

This year, the ’80’s were “in” 

(Adidas Superstars, anyone?) and 
“Stranger Things” capitalized on 
the decade’s sci-fi nostalgia in all 
the right ways. From the fantastic 
synth-alt music score to the emo-
tional return of ’90’s it-girl Winona 
Ryder (“Girl, Interrupted”), the 
Netflix original is hands-down 
this summer’s breakout hit. Heav-
ily influenced by 80’s films and 
novels — with references to “E.T.,” 
“Poltergeist” and “Carrie,” to 
name a few — “Stranger Things” 
follows the mysterious disappear-
ance of 12-year-old Will Byers in 
eight addictive episodes gener-
ously strewn with homages to 
cult favorites. But even those who 
weren’t around in the ’80’s (which 
I wasn’t) or are largely unfamiliar 
with the classics of the sci-fi/hor-

ror genre (which I’m not) still find 
“Stranger Things” spell-binding, 
wonderful and universally touch-
ing. The series, with its Spielberg-
esque small-town Indiana setting 
and 
impressive 
performances 

from adult and child actors alike, 
is able to play on a complex and 
varied range of emotional planes, 
seamlessly 
tapping 
into 
raw 

parental protection and boundless 
childhood imagination in the same 
episode. I found myself sporting 
a ridiculous smile on hour four 
of my “Stranger Things” binge 
because sweet nostalgia hit as I 
remembered when I, too, ate Eggo 
waffles and rode bikes into fantas-
tical adventures after school.

2. “Stranger Things”

It’s not, I don’t think, hyper-

bole to say that “Atlanta” redefined 
what’s possible on television. A 
scarcely present plot, a two-epi-
sode stretch (out of 10) without its 
star appearing on screen, an all-
Black cast — before Donald Glov-
er’s FX marvel, if these attributes 
were not entirely unheard of, they 
were quite definitely not the norm. 
Now, truly, anything’s a go.

In its richly nuanced, quietly 

cinematic debut season, “Atlanta” 
was a lot of things: one week a 
whip-smart entry into the canon 
of music television (give all the 
awards to whoever chose “Eleva-
tors (Me & You)” to close out the 
finale), the next a gorgeous ode to 
Black female friendship, the next 
an outlandish satire of cultural 
appropriation (is that even the 

right phrase to characterize that 
indescribably perfect half-hour of 
TV, “Juneteenth”?). Yet, through 
it all, its themes were never heavy-
handed, nor were its politics didac-
tic. And while “Atlanta” ’s essential 
draw was in legitimate surprise, 
everyday hustle this series, unlike 
many, actually cared to depict: 
people just trying to make some 
money. That reductive logline 
might not be the most grabby, and 
there are no chase scenes or explo-
sions to be found here, but “Atlan-
ta” is the most thrilling, exciting 
show in recent memory. What few 
boundaries the TV industry has 
left have been defiantly obliter-
ated, the doors definitively kicked 
down; I can’t wait to see what’s 
coming next.

4. Veep

In its fifth season, “Veep” 

changed hands from creator 
Armando Iannucci to David 
Mandel, who followed in the 
former 
showrunner’s 
foot-

steps with the same acerbic 
humor. Though Mandel did 
not shy away from toying with 
the show’s characters with 
arduous plots and unexpected 
setbacks, the show’s biting 
tone and sardonic portrayal of 
American politics continues 
to shine in its relentless, dark 
absurdity. “Veep” also con-
tinues to be anchored by Julia 
Louis-Dreyfus’ 
(“Seinfeld”) 

deft portrayal of the scathing, 
unlikable Selina Meyer, who 
we nonetheless root for. Man-
del’s adeptness at evoking pity 

for a comically horrible char-
acter explores who Selena is at 
heart, making this season one 
of “Veep” ’s most compelling. 
In finding Selena at her worst, 
the series is unexpectedly pro-
pelled forward using its great-
est strengths.

Like 
Selena’s 
maladroit 

political team, Mandel bravely 
forges ahead in a new direc-
tion with an unexpected end 
to the season’s arc. In doing 
so, Mandel explores who Sele-
na and the show is at heart, 
aided by the constant stream 
of bureaucratic screw-ups at 
the hands of one of TV’s fun-
niest ensembles.

4. “Cranes in the Sky” 

Solange

When I first heard this 

song, I thought Solange was 
singing about birds. I thought 
the cranes in her sky were big, 
long-necked, migratory birds. 
I thought it was about move-
ment and escape. It wasn’t 
until I did a quick Genius lyric 
search for this blurb that I 
came across all this talk about 
construction.

Supported by Raphael Saa-

diq’s serene orchestral bass, 
“Cranes in the Sky” floats. 
Stripped of meaning and inten-
tion, it’s light and dreamy. Sol-
ange’s vocals are soft and the 
lyrics are simple, but there’s 
something 
else 
that 
lurks 

beneath its surface.

“I tried to drink it away / I 

tried to put one in the air / I 
tried to dance it away / I tried 
to change it with my hair,” the 
song begins.

What is this “it” that Sol-

ange wants so desperately to 
escape? The song itself doesn’t 
give an answer — there’s never 
an antecedent. But for me, and 
I’m sure many others, “it” is 

the communal loneliness of 
womanhood, and more spe-
cifically Black womanhood. 
It is the force that constantly 
pull women away from each 
other — an idea that is made 
strikingly 
tangible 
in 
the 

track’s accompanying video, 
where shots of Solange alone 
in the desert are interspersed 
with her lying down, her limbs 
interwoven with those of other 
women. With this track, Sol-
ange beautifully captures the 
absurdity of loneliness in a 
hyperconnected world, as well 
as its inevitability. 

In that way, “Cranes in the 

Sky” is a song of opposites. The 
best hint towards what the “it” 
might be comes in the chorus, 
where Solange sings “Well it’s 
like cranes in the sky / Some-
times I don’t want to feel those 
metal clouds.” Her loneliness 
looms over her like a crane, 
an image steeped in both hope 
and fear no matter which type 
of crane you think it is.

I still think it’s about birds.

7. The People V. O.J. 

Football 
player-turned-crim-

inal O.J. Simpson regained some 
spotlight this year, but not in 
the way you’d expect. Preceding 
Ezra Edelman’s incredible five-
part documentary “O.J.: Made 
in America” was Ryan Murphy’s 
just-as-phenomenal “The People 
v. O.J. Simpson,” the first season 
of his “American Crime Story” 
anthology series on FX. While the 
former gave a comprehensive look 
at the rise and fall of O.J. Simpson 
as a figure in American culture, 
the latter focused on the notori-
ous homicide of Simpson’s ex wife 
Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald 
Goldman, showcasing its effect on 
Simpson, played by Cuba Gooding 
Jr. (“Snow Dogs”) in a comeback 
role, as well as everyone involved 
in the trial. As predictable as the 
show may be, “The People v. O.J. 
Simpson” defies almost every pos-
sible expectation, boosting its Jef-
frey Toobin source material with 
an outstanding Emmy-winning 
cast, immersive cinematography, 
brilliant writing and a nuanced 
perspective into the so-called 
“trial of the century.” Had it been 
put in the wrong hands, the FX 
show would have been a disaster or 
simply a middling, somewhat pass-
able piece of television. Luckily, 
that isn’t the case, as Murphy and 
screenwriting duo Scott Alexander 

and Larry Karaszewski (“Goose-
bumps”) remain true to capturing 
the authenticity and intensity of 
the events surrounding O.J.’s trial.

In addition to being a drama-

tized account of the O.J. trial, “The 
People v. O.J. Simpson” touches 
upon topics that are just as relevant 
and timely as ever: the toxic per-
vasiveness of the media, the racial 
turbulence in L.A. post-Rodney 
King riots, the overt sexism thrown 
against prosecutor Marcia Clark 
(Sarah Paulson, “American Horror 
Story”) and more. Even when we 
think our society has progressed 
since 1994, it’s amazing that these 
issues can still resonate today. But 
perhaps the strongest element of 
“The People v. O.J. Simpson” is 
the acting, which transformed the 
famed players of the O.J. trial into 
engaging, three-dimensional char-
acters. While Paulson gives the 
performance of a lifetime as Clark, 
Courtney B. Vance (“Office Christ-
mas Party”) and Sterling K. Brown 
(“This is Us”) shine in their break-
out roles as defense lawyer Johnnie 
Cochran and prosecutor Christo-
pher Darden, respectively. Within 
its mere 10 episodes, “The People 
v. O.J. Simpson” spins its story into 
something that is not only worthy 
of great entertainment, but also of 
necessary viewing.

6. “715 CREEKS” 

Bon Iver

Justin Vernon’s 22, A Mil-

lion marks a sort of depar-
ture for the artist, away from 
his traditionally folk-based, 
acoustic music to a more 
experimental, 
electronic 

sound. It’s kind of like what 
Kanye did with 808’s & Heart-
breaks. And that’s a fair com-
parison to make seeing as the 
two are friends, and make 
music together — this new 
Bon Iver project is heavily 
reminiscent of their collabo-
ration “Woods.” That track 
was an obvious precursor to 
“715 Creeks,” a standout track 
which features only Vernon’s 
vocals and a synthesizer. It’s 

here the artist best demon-
strates the strength of his 
vocals, the intensity of his lyr-
ics, and the inventiveness of 
his production to create some-
thing completely engrossing 
but totally heartbreaking. Lis-
tening to the song is exhaust-
ing, but in a cathartic way; it 
feels necessary and right, but 
that doesn’t make the emo-
tional impact any less severe.

Best Albums 

of 2016

1. Blonde 
Frank Ocean

In a year of anomalies, norm-

breaking and the unexpected, 
Frank Ocean remains his own 
island. When an artist can get hun-
dreds of thousands of young people 
to watch paint dry on live stream 
over a two-week period, there’s 
something unique happening. It 
indicates a shift in what we inter-
pret as “popular culture” or “main-
stream music.” 

But Ocean is a master of subvert-

ing whatever your norms might be. 
It’s his world, and we’re just living 
in it. In an Internet era where every 
opinion is granted the same space 
on the screen, it even amounts to 
criticism and anger. As the most 
prominent gay hip-hop artist per-
haps ever, there’s a lot that Ocean 
is expected to do and say, and when 
he doesn’t, questions hover. But like 
the genius of his music, he never 
follows the rules — your rules, 
that is. Ocean is revolutionary in 
his expression of his sexuality in 
that, at least through Ocean’s own 
voice, it garners little fanfare. He 
talks about having sex with women 
in one track, and men in another. 
Where so many artists have mis-
leadingly co-opted queerness to 
gain attention (ahem, James Fran-
co), Ocean does the opposite. He’s, 
well, frank about the struggles he 
faces as a man who loves other men 
(“Bad Religion” from his official 

debut is one of the most power-
ful musical expressions of sexual-
ity in decades), but never loud. It’s 
there, and you deal with it or you 
don’t. Ocean doesn’t care either 
way. When queerness, particularly 
male, is so often unapologetically 
stereotyped as flamboyant, dainty 
and in-your-face, it’s a refreshing, 
necessary perspective. 

That kind of subversion also 

happens to be astoundingly fruitful 
musically. Ocean has yet to release 
an official project which doesn’t 
exceed expectations, and Blonde is 
no exception. It’s less immediately 
approachable than Channel Orange 
or even Nostalgia ULTRA, but when 
it settles, what you find is one of the 
most beautiful, shattering pieces of 
sonic work in the last decade. The 
quiet build of “Ivy,” the tangibly 
downtrodden “Siegfried,” the crys-
tal clear “Good Guy” — these are 
all sparkling, somber moments on 
a journey which will continue not 
just tomorrow, but years down the 
road. With Blonde, Ocean has creat-
ed something which can be lived in, 
experienced; it can be taken apart 
and rearranged as you approach it 
with your own feelings and your 
own moments.

Blonde, simply, is felt.

— MATT GALLATIN

2. The Life of Pablo

Kanye West

Like all Kanye West albums, The 

Life of Pablo closes with a satisfying 
resolution. While “Wolves” doesn’t 
cap the actual track-list, it feels like 
the unofficial parting piece; unlike 
the 40-minute whirlwind that 
preceded it, Frank Ocean’s fleet-
ing but sobering appearance after 
“Wolves” brought with it a certain 
sense of rest and stability. For only a 
minute, it felt like Kanye was going 
to be alright after the perplexing 
and often indefensible buildup to 
the album’s release.

The seed of hope turned out 

being all we were offered, as 2016 
had Kanye in a knots over a whole 
host of issues, including the kid-
napping of his wife and anniver-
sary of his mother’s death. It’s an 
important hindsight; his dynamic 
with the various guests on the 
album, and how he creates space 
for them, paints a bigger picture. 
The grandiosity of The Life of Pablo 
becomes unexpectedly intimate 
and relatable despite initial critical 
response to the contrary.

Revisiting the album at the end 

of a bumpy year, it’s easy to reimag-
ine the ranting on “Pt. 2” as part of 
what might be going on in Kanye’s 
head when he, say, cancels a show 
after three songs. Or perhaps the 
paranoia and insecurity of “FML” 
can be found in his recent hospital-
ization. But this album isn’t about 
bleached assholes and sex with 

Taylor Swift so much as it is about 
trials and tribulations, as every 
Kanye album is.

Though renowned for his ability 

to orchestrate unlikely collabora-
tions, Pablo is surprisingly most 
gripping when Kanye is alone, 
frantically 
teetering 
between 

hopelessness and absurdly con-
fident transparency. Throughout 
the album he alternates between 
the security of a group dynamic 
and the retreaded shelter of his 
character-defining thoughts. Not 
for the first time (see: Pusha T on 
Runaway), he channels the voices 
of others to clear the jumbled mess 
in his head.

Tracks like “Ultralight Beam” 

and “Low Lights” hardly feature 
the voice of Kanye West at all. Yet 
they shed light on what he clutches 
onto most dearly to “get through 
the day”. “Freestyle 4” sees ‘Ye 
drunkenly snarl fantasies of having 
sex on the table at a dinner party: 
He blurs the line between spoken 
and unspoken, external and inter-
nal — what you do and what you 
want to do. The Life of Pablo is a 
meditated narration on a real life. 
It’s about those moments of pri-
vacy, depression, laughter, sex, love, 
confusion, helplessness; it’s about 
Ye, yes, but it’s also about me and 
you.

3. A Seat at the Table

Solange

Four years after her last offi-

cial release — eight since her last 
proper album — Solange Knowles 
has returned with a genre-defy-
ing album that is triumphant, 
nuanced and deeply frustrated. 
A masterclass in both sonic and 
thematic cohesion, A Seat at the 
Table is an R&B album at heart 
— most of its melodies driven by 
piano and closely accompanied 
by percussion. These melodies, 
however, flow freely, visiting 
and revisiting the album in short 
stints, lending even more poten-
cy to the interludes that deliver 
the deeply personal points of the 
album’s story.

In terms of race relations in 

the United States, that the past 
four years have been tumultuous 
is not a point that is up for con-
tention. Thematically, Solange’s 
album is a summation of the 
anger, sadness and disappoint-
ment accumulated during these 
years, but also a demonstration 
of resilience. It is an unapologet-

ic exploration of what it means to 
be a Black woman today, an eval-
uation of progress (or the lack 
thereof) and an affirmation and 
reinforcement of Black pride. I 
doubt that the significance and 
sheer power of this album can 
be overstated. A Seat at the Table 
carries more weight than I, as 
a white male, will likely ever 
understand, and I must admit 
that I do not trust in my ability to 
do justice to the album.

Any word of criticism that 

I utter should be taken with a 
grain of salt, no word of praise 
necessarily trusted, no evalu-
ation taken at face value. This 
album is beyond me — beyond 
many of us — and only if we 
acknowledge that can we hope to 
progress. What is ultimately and 
absolutely apparent, however, is 
that Solange has earned her seat 
at the proverbial table; what she’s 
telling us, all too clearly, is that 
no one should have to.

A few miles away from central 
Ann Arbor, at Lotus Farm, the 
picturesque backdrop led for an 
immersive experience of Gay’s 
lush imagery. Amid the twilight 
and blooms, Gay exalted every-
thing from the musical names 
of plants to the dance of a robin, 
while still finding moments of 

silence and stillness to honor 
loved ones gone too soon. He 
shared “essayettes” as well, 
anecdotes focused on “delight” 
steeped in humility that harkens 
back to an alternate definition of 
an essay as an attempt or trial — 
humorous musings on anything 
from nightmares to sneakiness. 
Gay’s work did, and still con-

Best TV Episodes of 2016

1. “Fish Out of Water”

Bojack Horseman

As an homage to Charlie 

Chaplin, Looney Tunes and 
Sofia Coppola’s “Lost in Trans-
lation,” the tour de force “Fish 
Out of Water” is a masterwork 
in both animation and storytell-
ing. Despite the lack of dialogue 
— the episode is almost entirely 
silent — “Fish Out of Water” 
compels in its wonderful, eye-
popping visuals, as well as its 
zany and surprisingly poignant 
premise. When the hapless 
BoJack descends into the sea to 
promote his biopic Secretariat at 
the Pacific Ocean Film Festival, 
shenanigans immediately ensue. 
Without a cigarette to light, a 
vodka to drink or a voice to com-
municate with sea creatures, 
BoJack is both physically and 
emotionally lost in this unfa-
miliar 
environment, 
causing 

for some deeply unsettling (and 
hilarious) gags.

It’s a delight and a pity to see 

BoJack interact in this beauti-
fully constructed abyss, which 
is a testament to the brilliant 
artistic vision of creator Raphael 
Bob-Waksberg. After going on 
an insane, death-defying quest 
to find Kelsey Jennings (Maria 
Bamford, “Lady Dynamite”), 
the woman fired from directing 
Secretariat, BoJack digs deep 
into his soul and writes: “In this 
terrifying world, all we have are 
the connections that we make.” 
It’s a bit of risk for a show built 
on excellent banter to solely rely 
on animation, but “Fish Out of 
Water” pays off tremendously in 
its experimental approach and 
reaffirms “BoJack Horseman” 
as one of the most touching, 
vibrant and genuinely thought-
provoking TV satires currently 
on air.

2. “The Animals”

Orange is the New Black

While so much of TV watch-

ing is passive, the penultimate 
episode in season four of 
“Orange is the New Black” is 
anything but. The series has 
never been afraid to be politi-
cal or controversial, readily 
employing what is considered 
taboo as an agent to explore 
the humanity of its characters. 
But in “The Animals,” this is 
taken a momentous step fur-
ther. The episode culminates 
in a heartbreaking, nuanced 

and complicated death of one 
of the series’ most beloved 
protagonists that inevitably 
transcends from the fiction-
al screen to the messy, real 
world. With impeccable writ-
ing and nuanced storytelling, 
“The Animals” perfectly cap-
tures the tension that lies at 
the core of the entire series: 
Right and wrong is rarely 
black and white and good peo-
ple sometimes do evil things.

3. “Marcia, Marcia, Marcia”

People V. O.J.

A key reason why “The People 

v. OJ Simpson” is among the best 
shows of the year is in how it brings 
the real figures of the case to life 
and makes them three-dimension-
al characters. No episode of the 
series does this more than “Mar-
cia, Marcia, Marcia.” The hour 
focuses on Marcia Clark, the main 
prosecutor on Simpson’s trial. It 
depicts the toll the trial took on 
her, both in terms of her relation-
ship with her family and her emo-
tions. In the episode, her husband 
complains to the press about how 
she’s failing to take care of her chil-

dren and she gets the famous hair-
cut which the press makes fun of 
her for. Sarah Paulson (“American 
Horror Story”) won an Emmy for 
her performance as Clark and this 
episode was likely the centerpiece 
for that campaign. Her chemistry 
with Sterling K. Brown’s (“This 
is Us”) Chris Darden is another 
highlight, as Darden and Clark 
become closer. While the entire 
run of “The People v. OJ” was quite 
remarkable, this hour proved to be 
its best, mostly due to Paulson’s 
amazing work as Clark.

4. “B.A.N.”

Atlanta

Part of what made “Atlanta” 

such a success in its inaugural sea-
son was its unabashed willingness 
to take risks with the assuredness 
of a well established series, as it 
often turns to the surreal and unex-
plained to provide further insight 
on its unique subject matter and 
characters. Written and directed 
by series creator and star Donald 
Glover, “B.A.N.” proved to be the 
biggest dive the series took and it 
paid dividends.

Framed as an episode of the 

fictional talk show “Montague” 
on the titular “Black America 
Network,” the episode focuses its 
spotlight on Bryan Tyree Henry’s 
(“Vice Principals”) Paper Boi as 
the program forces him to navi-
gate several complex subjects, from 
transphobia to Black culture. Hen-
ry’s performance continuously ties 
the episode together as he conveys 
Paper Boi’s confusion, frustration 

and eventual clarity, saying, “It’s 
hard for me to care about this when 
nobody cares about me as a Black 
human man … where’s tolerance for 
people like me?”

Meanwhile, “B.A.N.” ’s use of 

parodic commercials further bol-
stered its arguments, as Glover 
puts on a showcase in comedic 
writing, constantly raising the 
bar with each subsequent seg-
ment, ultimately culminating in 
a cereal commercial that steers 
into a shocking display of police 
brutality.

In a first season that constantly 

challenges its form and struc-
ture, “B.A.N.” serves as a peak 
to “Atlanta” ’s many highs, con-
fidently encapsulating the hilari-
ous, perplexing and challenging 
tone that defined the show’s first 
brave steps in the landscape of 
television.

5. “The 
Magic 

of 

David 

Copperfield”

“The 
Americans” 
typically 

doesn’t traffic in big, show-stopping 
moments. Even when it must 
depict scenes that, on any other 
show, would be executed in showy, 
headline-grabbing 
fashion, 
the 

FX series applies the same rigor, 
patience and subtlety that it has 
become known for. “The Magic 
of David Copperfield” opens in 
several 
minutes 
of 
sustained 

silence, culminating in Martha’s 
heartbreaking 
departure; 
the 

episode ends with a seven-month 

time jump, the family — ostensibly 
— in much better shape than it was 
before.

What transpires between those 

bookending 
scenes 
is 
vintage 

“Americans:” 
pressure-cooker 

tension and all the cutting family 
drama that feeds into it. Every line, 
shot and character choice in this 
show is beautifully judged; “The 
Americans” is pulp as high art, 
narrative as sustained metaphor, 
the 
intra-familial 
psychological 

warfare of marriage, children and 

patriotism as Cold War spy thriller. 
As the episode ended, I was almost 
relieved at this relaxed sigh of a 
time-jump. But, as “The Americans” 
is wont to do, the show can’t resist a 
twist of the knife: Everyone in this 
family, just as every family must do, 
is feigning happiness. Paige is not 
contentedly hanging with Pastor 
Tim; she’s on assignment from her 
parents, and we see the remorse on 
her face. The Statue of Liberty has, 
indeed, disappeared.
