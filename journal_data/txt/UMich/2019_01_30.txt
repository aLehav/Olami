In 
light 
of 
sub-zero 
temperatures 
and 
extreme 
wind 
chills 
predicted 
for 
Wednesday and Thursday, the 
University of Michigan has 
decided to cancel all events and 
classes on campus, beginning 
12 a.m. Wednesday and intends 
to resume activity 7 a.m. Friday. 
This will be the third time in 40 
years the school has closed due 
to weather.
The 
University 
Record 
announced 
classes 
were 
canceled 
at 
3:30 
p.m. 
on 
Tuesday.
The last time the University 
halted activity was in February 
2015, due to a winter storm that 
resulted in 18 inches of snowfall. 
Before that, there was a closure 
in 2014 due to extremely cold 
temperatures, 
specifically 
a 
wind chill of minus 30 degrees. 
The first time the University 
closed was in January 1978 
due 
to 
climate 
conditions. 
Weather projections estimate 
a wind chill of nearly minus 
40 degrees for Wednesday and 
part of Thursday. 
Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer 
declared a state of emergency 
early Tuesday morning.
The 
decision 
to 
cancel 
classes comes after of closures 
on 
campus 
and 
of 
local 
businesses around Ann Arbor 
on Monday. University student 
groups, such as the Michigan 
Student 
Power 
Network, 
also took to advocating for a 

campus closure through their 
#UMichColdShoulder petition, 
which 
currently 
has 
over 
13,000 signatures. The petition 
also encouraged students to 
call Schlissel as well as other 
University administrators. 
The 
University 
joins 
Michigan State University and 
Wayne State University, as well 
as other public universities in 
the state, in canceling classes 
due 
to 
extreme 
weather 
conditions. The delay prompted 
a 
flurry 
of 
social 
media 
posts critical of University 
administration, 
particulary 
Schlissel, although the official 
announcement was signed by 
Provost Martin Philbert; Preeti 
Malani, chief health officer; 
Laurita Thomas, chief human 
resources officer; and Eddie 
Washington, executive director 
of the Division of Public Safety 
and Security.
LSA 
sophomore 
Kirsten 
Lanigan expressed her surprise 
at the class cancellation. 
“It 
definitely 
was 
an 
unexpected pleasant surprise,” 
Lanigan said. “I was definitely 
not sure whether a state of 
emergency would be enough 
for Schlissel to cancel, but it’s 
nice that he was willing to 
stoop to our level and pity us as 
students.”
Lanigan said getting to class 
in this weather would have 
been difficult due to living off-
campus. 
“It definitely would have 
been a really big struggle to get 
to campus,” Lanigan said. “I’m 
not sure exactly what I would 
have done because I definitely 

live the distance where any of 
my classes would have been 
more than 10 minutes away and 
it would have been dangerous, 
so 
I’m 
really 
happy 
they 
canceled.”
Though the University has 
ultimately decided to cancel 
classes, disabled, injured and 
commuting 
students 
have 
already been feeling the harsh 
effects of the weather for days.
LSA 
freshman 
Madeline 
Walsh has a torn ACL, an injury 
that makes it difficult for her 
to get around campus. Walsh 
said the University has been 
doing a good job of getting 
the pathways clear in a timely 
fashion.
“Slipping was a very real 
possibility, but the snow hasn’t 
been too bad,” Walsh said. 
“They’re doing a pretty good 
job of keeping it off the most 
important sidewalks, so getting 
to the more populated areas 
hasn’t been too bad.”
Amir 
Baghdadchi, 
senior 
associate director of University 
Housing Association, told The 
Daily in an email the University 
staff 
works 
tirelessly 
day 
and night to maintain the 
campus conditions and keep 
the sidewalks walkable for all 
students.
“We have a full Facilities 
team that is always ready, at 
all hours, with shovels and 
snow machines,” Baghdadchi 
wrote. “Instead of ‘shutting 
down’ during the cold, our 
efforts ramp up, because cold 
can disrupt so many systems, 

LSA senior Aly Nedell is 
taking a course titled The 
Italian Mafia this semester. 
Any other student might elect 
to take Italian 240 out of pure 
curiosity, or to fulfill the 
distribution requirement in 
the humanities. But Nedell is 
receiving credit for this course 
as her language requirement.
Nedell took three years 
of Italian in high school but 
placed 
into 
the 
beginner 
Italian 101 course after taking 
her University of Michigan 
foreign language placement 
exam. After taking a portion 
of the course and dropping 
it, fearing poor performance 
would lower her grade point 
average, Nedell was told by 
her academic adviser that she 
would have to take Italian 102 
in order to compensate for 
not completing Italian 101. 
Unable to find information 
about 
alternatives 
online, 
she met with her academic 
adviser, who led her in the 
direction of petitioning the 
requirement. Soon after, she 
began exploring the process 
of finding an alternative to the 
LSA language requirement.
“It was honestly one of the 
most emotionally exhausting 
experiences 
as 
a 
student 
because 
there’s 
so 
much 
research into people who 
just struggle with foreign 
language,” Nedell said. “But 

because LSA is so regimented 
with their requirements, it’s 
not easy to find information 
on alternatives.”
After 
meeting 
with 
an 
academic 
adviser 
and 
completing 
an 
interview 
stating her case, Nedell took a 
90-minute Modern Language 
Aptitude 
Test, 
which 
she 
described as similar to the 
placement 
exam 
that 
is 
required of most LSA students 
prior 
to 
starting 
at 
the 
University.
“(I had) to schedule an 
appointment to take an LSA 
language aptitude test, but it’s 
in no particular language — 
it’s a fake language that you 

have to try to teach yourself,” 
Nedell 
said. 
“During 
(the 
exam) they provide you with 
fake words, but you do what 
you would normally do when 
learning a language.”
The score Nedell received 
on the aptitude test, in tandem 
with the academic adviser’s 
report, became her evidence 
to 
prove 
she 
could 
not 
learn and excel in language 
courses. In addition to these 
administered portions, Nedell 
was asked to provide two 
letters 
of 
recommendation 
from past Italian professors, 
explaining her inability to 
learn Italian. She also wrote 
an essay and submitted college 

and high school academic 
transcripts. 
After 
nearly 
nine months of searching 
and 
requesting 
permission 
for an alternative to the LSA 
language requirement, Nedell 
was approved to take two 
equivalent semesters of Italian 
culture classes to satisfy the 
requirement.
The 
LSA 
language 
requirement 
requires 
students 
to 
take 
four 
semesters worth of language 
courses in hopes the student 
will 
become 
proficient 
in a language other than 
English. 

Ann Arbor City Council 
voted to approve a settlement 
for a lawsuit filed against 
the city by Councilmember 
Anne Bannister, D-Ward 1, 
and former Councilmember 
Sumi Kailasapathy, D-Ward 
1, at the Jan. 22 City Council 
meeting. 
Bannister 
and 
Kailasapathy 
filed 
the 
lawsuit in June to invalidate 
a $10 million contract Mayor 
Christopher Taylor and City 
Clerk 
Jacqueline 
Beaudry 
signed with Core Spaces, a 
Chicago-based 
developer 
which planned to construct 
a 17-storey high-rise in the 
Library Lot.
According to the lawsuit, 
the Ann Arbor city charter 
stipulates any purchase or sale 
of a value exceeding $25,000 
be approved by at least eight 
councilmembers. Since Taylor 
and Beaudry did not seek 
the approval of City Council, 
Bannister and Kailasapathy 
argued the contract was not 
valid.

ALIGNE D INVESTING GLOBAL

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: STUDENTS SIT IN TO PROTEST RESEARCH

January 27, 1978
WICKED BLIZZARD BITES 
EAST, MIDWEST
Winter 
dealt 
Michigan 
a 
cruel arctic blow yesterday as a 
severe storm--fueled by furious 
winds and the lowest barometric 
readings on record--whipped 
parts of the’ state with over a 
foot and half of snow. Governor 
William Milliken declared a state 
of emergency, and ordered the 
National Guard into five counties 
including Washtenaw, to help 
stranded motorists and assist in 
emergency calls.
University 
classes 
will 

be closed until noon today, 
University 
President 
Robben 
Fleming said late lat night. The 
deadline for Drop/Add and Pass/
Fail has been extended through 
Monday. 
Milliken’s 
declaration 
will 
allow the state to seek federal help 
for repairing and restoring public 
services and-facilities damaged 
by 
the 
storm. 
Southeastern 
Michigan, 
according 
to 
the 
National Weather Service, is 
expecting one to two inches of 
additional snow today and a high 
temperature of 16 degrees. Fierce 
winds, however, will continue 

to drift snow and hamper the 
digging-out effort.
The University shivering and 
sputtering under an estimated 
19 inches of snow, cancelled 
classes after 1 p.m. yesterday, 
and the prospect for normal 
academic 
schedules 
today 
remains uncertain. The main 
libraries closed their doors at 
4 p.m., food deliveries to the 
dormitories were curtailed, 
and 
many 
people 
in 
the 
academic community decided 
to remain at home, safe from 
the swirling snow.
Local hospitals reported many 

normal operations, but at least 
one facility, St. Joseph’s, cancelled 
routine surgery, according to 
a 
spokesperson. 
University 
Hospital, 
according 
to 
an 
official, maintained unhindered 
in-patient care and supporting 
services such as housekeeping 
and dietetics, but was forced 
to 
close 
many 
out-patient 
clinics. Emergency services, the 
spokesperson said, were “open 
and ready to go.” The only serious 
emergency procedures involved 
auto accident victims.
STAY INSIDE? SNOW WAY
So what do you do on a Thursday 

afternoon when the world outside 
looks like a Jack London short story 
and the University has cancelled 
classes? Most folks looked forward 
to a Norman Rockwell sort of day-a 
quiet time
in front of a fire with a mug of 
hot chocolate, a book, or perhaps 
some cozy company.
BUT A BAND of crazies from 
West Quad’s Williams House had 
other ideas.
“We’re just trying to prove 
that it’s all in the head,” said one 
inhabitant of what the group calls 
“The Zoo,” ignoring the knee-
high drifts all around him. He and 

his hallmates had stripped down 
to t-shirts and shorts and were 
dashing through a set of relays 
between the steps of the Union and 
the “Daedalus” sculpture across 
State Street-barefoot.
“Actually, we took a wrong turn 
at Albuquerque,” reported another.
A slightly sauced crowd in front 
of the Cariage House apartments 
threw the day’s big social event-
”the first beach party of the year.” 
Lounging in drifts of “sand.” 
the snowbathers guzzled beer 
and other booze, all day blaring 
sound of the Beach Boys’ “Endless 
Summer.”

This Week in History 

MONDAY:
Looking at the Numbers

Journalist Joe Grimm and 
local radio host Martin Bandyke 
invited community members to 
the Ann Arbor District Library 
Tuesday 
evening 
to 
discuss 
Grimm’s “The Faygo Book,” 
a collection of photographs, 
graphics and stories published 
in October 2018 that explore the 
history of local soda pop company 
Faygo. About six people attended 
the event, which included a 
presentation by Grimm followed 
by a book sale and signing. 
Grimm, 
a 
University 
of 
Michigan alum who currently 
teaches journalism at Michigan 
State University, kicked off the 
evening by introducing his career 
and his experience writing the 
book. When asked by Bandyke 
how “The Faygo Book” came to 
be, Grimm said after writing a 
book about Detroit-based chain 
Coney Island, he decided to 
focus on Faygo next because he’d 
always appreciated the brand. 
“I 
really 
liked 
Faygo 
commercials and the fun of it all, 
and I thought it would be a really 
interesting book because it’s 
such a colorful, varied product,” 
Grimm said.
Though the Faygo company 

was not interested in helping 
with the book, Grimm said 
he learned a lot about the 
company’s history by meeting 
regularly with Susie Feigenson, 
the granddaughter of one of 
the original founders. He also 
did his own research and found 
photos and information through 
social media.
Grimm then held an hour-long 
discussion on the history and 
cultural significance of Faygo 
soda pop. Faygo was started in 
1907 by brothers Ben and Perry 
Feigenson, 
Russian 
Jewish 
immigrants based in Cleveland. 
Perry, the older of the two 
brothers, moved to Detroit to 
start a bakery, but hated the 
early hours required by the job. 
Ben, who was working at the 
Miller Becker soda pop company 
in Cleveland, then moved to 
Detroit, and the two launched 
their own pop business. They 
started with three flavors — fruit 
punch, grape and strawberry — 
based off Perry’s recipe for cake 
frosting.
Grimm said the Feigensons 
entered the industry at a time 
when it was difficult to make a 
profit off pop for several reasons.
“People didn’t drink pop in 
the winter, like today was a no 
pop day, it was a summer thing,” 

Grimm said. “Another reason 
was when you sold the pop, they 
would sell eight-ounce bottles for 
three cents each, two for a nickel, 
but the bottles were worth a lot 
more.”
Other issues, Grimm said, 
included the fact that pop had 
a shorter shelf life in the early 
1900s, 
plus 
the 
Feigensons 
launched Faygo right before 
a worldwide depression. Still, 
the Feigenson brothers were 
immensely successful selling out 
of the Jewish enclave of Detroit. 
They profited off the city’s 
population growth, a result of 
immigration and the burgeoning 
car business.
“The car business, and frankly 
Ford, were making Detroit and 
everything around it grow like 
crazy,” Grimm said.
Grimm also shared facts about 
Faygo’s many flavors. He noted 
Faygo products are all kosher, 
unlike many other brands, and 
also pointed out Faygo’s Rock 
& Rye! flavor is named after 
an alcoholic drink made of rye 
whiskey and rock candy sugar.
Moving 
on 
to 
Faygo’s 
relationship with the federal 
government, 
Grimm 
said 
land and material shortages 
have historically affected the 
company. In 1935, the federal 
government 
took 
over 
some of Faygo’s property to 
construct housing for the local 
neighborhood.
“They were told the federal 
government needed the land 
their factory was on to put in 
more housing for people in 
Black Bottom,” Grimm said. 
“Black Bottom is crowded — 
now we need high rises.”
The 
Feigensons 
bought 
a horse market that they 
converted into a new factory. 
Grimm said the factory still 
exists, and in fact, Faygo is 
the last remaining soda pop 
bottler in Detroit.
During 
World 
War 
II, 
Grimm added, Faygo was 
impacted by sugar rations. 
Many materials were in short 
supply due to the war effort, 
including tin, rubber, grease, 
meat and nylons.
“If you didn’t cut your 
consumption of sugar as a 
candy maker, cake maker, 
pop bottler, you had to cut to 
80 percent of what you used 
last year,” Grimm said. “The 
first thing to be rationed after 

Pearl Harbor was sugar, and the 
last thing to be de-rationed was 
sugar.”
At the same time, Coca Cola 
campaigned heavily for the use 
of its products by American 
soldiers, so Grimm said Coca 
Cola advocates helped make 
sugar rationing more lenient. 
The Feigensons also donated to 
the troops.
Another major historical event 
the Faygo company endured was 
the 1967 rebellion over racial 
tension in Detroit. Grimm said 
Susie Feigenson was working at 
Faygo at the time, and witnessed 
the 
destruction 
of 
many 
storefronts in the neighborhood. 
However, she was surprised to 
find the Faygo factory untouched. 
Faygo’s safety during the riot 
was ensured by its inclusive 
hiring practices. He said Faygo 
hired locals, meaning 60 percent 
of its male workers and 75 
percent of its production workers 
at the time were Black.
“I think what happened was 
that the way they hired helped 
them out later,” Grimm said. 
“People said, ‘No, we’re not 
messing up that place, that’s 
where we work.’”
Grimm 
concluded 
the 
presentation 
by 
giving 
an 
overview of Faygo’s advertising 
practices. He displayed several 
images of historical billboards 
and TV commercials sponsored 
by Faygo, and named some of 
Faygo’s past celebrity sponsors, 
such as Alex Karras, a 1962 
Detroit Lions defensive lineman.
In 1965, Grimm said, Faygo 
began expanding its business 
geographically. 
The 
company 
was threatened by Coca Cola’s 
advertising success in Traverse 
City and Toledo.
“Faygo hurried up and the 
Feigensons sent pop into those 
cities,” Grimm said. “People saw 
the commercials, they went to 
the store, they bought the pop, 
they wanted more, and from that 
point forward, Faygo started 
trying to get to be bigger than the 
mostly Detroit area.”
After 
speaking, 
Grimm 
accepted a few questions from 
the audience. Bandyke asked 
why Faygo continues to be a 
successful brand. Grimm said 
in addition to Faygo’s prize-
winning flavors, low prices and 
tactful advertising, the company 
is dedicated to its local base.

After Ann Arbor residents 
voted in November to approve 
Proposal A, an amendment 
to 
the 
city 
charter 
that 
required the city to retain 
ownership 
of 
the 
Library 
Lot, 
City 
Administrator 
Howard Lazarus sent a letter 
to Core Spaces in December 
terminating 
their 
purchase 
agreement.
The 
council 
voted 
8-1 
to settle the lawsuit with 
Bannister and Kailasapathy on 
Jan 22. This final settlement 
will require the city attorney 
to 
sign 
additional 
legal 
documents, preventing the city 
from selling the development 
rights of the Library Lot.
Upon Taylor’s suggestion, 
Bannister recused herself from 
the vote, as she was a plaintiff 

in the lawsuit. Councilmember 
Jeff Hayner, D-Ward 1, was the 
only no vote on approving the 
settlement. 
Councilmember 
Chip Smith, D-Ward 5, was not 
present for the meeting.
Hayner 
explained 
his 
reasons for voting no on the 
settlement, stating he was 
unsure of the council’s ability 
to invalidate a contract. He 
questioned 
the 
necessity 
of City Council to approve 
contracts like the one the city 
was engaged in with Core 
Spaces.
“I would like this body to 
take a look at its rules,” Hayner 
said. “I don’t think it’s proper 
that a body reserve the right 
for itself to waive the final 
review of a contract.”
Councilmember Jack Eaton, 
D-Ward 4, expressed concerns 
similar to Hayner’s but voted 
yes to approve the settlement. 
Councilmember Ali Ramlawi, 

D-Ward 5, also voted yes on 
the settlement but wanted to 
clarify that his vote was only 
in agreement with affirming 
procedural 
requirements 
stipulated by the city charter 
and was not a vote to prevent 
the 
development 
by 
Core 
Spaces.
“I would like to go on 
record saying I was under the 
impression that that’s what 
the lawsuit was about — it 
was not about preventing the 
construction 
of 
a 
building 
but about the procedures of 
a whole process,” Ramlawi 
said. “And if we are going to be 
consistent up here, we have to 
respect that principle.”
After the vote, Bannister 
read a prepared statement 
thanking the city attorney for 
recommending settlement of 
the lawsuit and the council for 
approving the settlement.
“When Sumi Kailasapathy 

and I filed our complaint last 
June, we did not take that 
matter lightly,” Bannister said. 
“We did so because we believed 
that when City Council votes 
to approve a contract, that 
contract must be available for 
our review.”
Bannister 
ended 
her 
comments by declaring her 
hope for the city to follow 
proper procedures, as written 
in the city charter, when 
approving contracts in the 
future.
“By settling this case, we are 
acknowledging that the voters 
amended the city charter in 
November and we are agreeing 
that the city will not proceed 
with the sale of the Library 
Lot to Core Spaces,” Bannister 
said. “I hope we will also agree 
that going forward, that the 
city will approve contracts only 
when the contracts are written 
and available for review.”

and we have to be vigilant. Just 
like everything in Housing, 
it’s a 24-hour operation: once 
we’ve done each corner of the 
building, we start over again to 
maintain safety.”
Walsh also said while the 
University 
has 
been 
doing 
a good job, she had to make 
sacrifices for her wellbeing and 
not attend her classes or club 
meetings due to the slippery 
sidewalks and roads last week. 
She 
noted 
her 
professors 
were accommodating of her 
situation. 
“I had to skip class on 
Wednesday [last week], the day 
it was really icy out, and there 
were a few club mass meetings 
I didn’t get to go to on Tuesday 
night of last week,” Walsh said.
Walsh 
is 
one 
of 
many 
students who lives on North 
Campus and takes the buses 
every day. On Monday, a Blue 
Bus slid off of Fuller Road and 
crashed into a tree. She said 
the bus crash scared her, as 
she is already injured, and it 
made her think about other 
students and faculty who have 
to drive longer distances to get 
to campus.
“When one of the girls said 
she had felt herself jolt when 
the bus crashed, that was a 
little scary, because I’m not 
looking to get any more hurt,” 
Walsh said. “It definitely was 
concerning, especially with all 
of the professors and students 
that drive to school. It made me 
think that we should probably 
not expect everyone to have to 
endure all of those conditions.”
According to First District 
of the Michigan State Police, 
which includes Clinton, Eaton, 
Ingham, Hillsdale, Jackson, 
Lenawee, Livingston, Monroe 
and 
Washtenaw 
Counties, 
there were a total of 117 crashes 
in the district on Monday.
The Division of Public Safety 
& Security issued a warning on 
Sunday about especially snowy 
and slippery roads on Monday 

and Tuesday. Similarly, the 
Ann Arbor Police Department 
advised 
city 
members 
and 
students 
to 
avoid 
driving 
during the snow and spend 
minimal 
amounts 
of 
time 
outside.
LSA 
sophomore 
Shelby 
Alston commutes 90 minutes 
each way, five days a week. She 
drives an hour every day and 
then parks 30 minutes away 
from campus as part of the free 
parking program. Alston said 
she often has to decide whether 
her safety or a class is more 
important.
“It’s 
been 
really 
tough, 
especially since, you know, 
every school from my house 
to the University is closing, 
and I know it’s going to be a 
dangerous drive and I find 
myself in my head weighing my 
options and sort of choosing 
between safety and a grade,” 
Alston 
said. 
“It’s 
really 
unfortunate sometimes to have 
to make those decisions.”
Alston 
noted 
that 
Perry 
Samson, professor of climate 
and 
space 
sciences 
and 
engineering, live streamed his 
lectures and enabled students 
to continue to interact even 
if they were watching from 
home. She said she wishes the 
University would implement 
more classes like Samson’s.
“I think the main issue (is) 
that they either need to be more 
lenient in their (attendance) 
policies or they need to have 
more classes that do things 
live streaming,” Alston said. 
“I thought it was amazing. He 
took a video of himself, had the 
audio streaming, and if we had 
any questions, we could type 
it in an anonymous platform 
and his GSIs would tell him. 
It was still interactive, and 
I wasn’t stressed because if 
there was snow, I could still 
attend lecture and still get 
the valuable teaching that I 
wanted. Because it’s not that 
I don’t want to go — I want to 
hear what my teacher has to 
say. Lecture is valuable, you 
know?”
A 
Public 
Policy 
junior 

who 
requested 
to 
remain 
anonymous due to the small size 
of her class said her professor 
is requiring the class to log 
onto an online Canvas chat on 
Wednesday to participate in a 
class discussion at the normal 
8:30 a.m. start time, ending at 
9:50 a.m. as usual. 
“She did make it very clear 
that if we do not have internet 
or do not have access to internet 
that she will excuse us from 
class — we just have to let her 
know,” the student said. 
The student expressed their 
understanding that the online 
discussion is being used to 
avoid falling behind in class 
material.
“I understand where the 
professor is coming from,” the 
student said. “We only have 
only so many class periods 
throughout 
the 
semester 
to meet and getting behind 
even one can be difficult for 
a professor to make up, so I 
understand where Professor 
Lin is coming from.”
While 
the 
professor 
said the grades of students 
without internet will not be 
penalized, the student said 
those people will be inherently 
disadvantaged by missing the 
class material. 
“It is just a little bit difficult 
when some students, if they do 
not have access to internet, they 
are now missing out on a class 
period that the rest of the class 
gets to enjoy,” the student said. 
“Also with it being on a chat 
based site and not even a video 
chat, we are missing out on 
face-to-face interactions with 
our other students regarding 
information that could be used 
later in the class, so to me it 
feels like I might be missing out 
on a particular environment 
that I could learn better in.”
The 
student 
has 
never 
participated in an online class 
and said she is worried about 
being evaluated on this basis.
“It’s going to be a big group 
chat from my understanding 
— like I said, I’ve never used it 
before,” the student said. “I’ve 
never had a professor use this 

thing on Canvas, so I’m not 100 
percent sure what its going to 
look like, which is also kind of 
nerve wracking.” 
The student said the online 
chat hinders the quality of 
discussion because students 
cannot speak face-to-face.
“I feel like I learn better 
in an environment where I 
can see my peers around me 
and by forcing us to have this 
discussion online, it seems 
like it can hinder the very 
collaborative 
environment 
that the Ford School likes to 
promote, and so this just feels 
like we might be losing valuable 
time that we could be spending 
in the classroom discussing 
this stuff,” the student said.
Northwood III Hall Director 
Stephanie Pocsi said in an 
email that students with meal 
plans can order Dining To-Go 
Meals 
on 
Wednesday 
and 
Thursday for either lunch or 
dinner, which will be delivered 
to 
students’ 
buildings 
or 
community centers.
“The meal will be delivered 
to the (Community Center) 
according to the type of meal,” 
Poscsi said. “Lunch will be 
delivered around 12 p.m. and 
dinner around 5 p.m. as long as 
the weather allows. The dining 
halls will still be open; we just 
wanted to offer an option so 
folks didn’t feel that they had to 
either walk through the winter 
weather or not eat.”
University 
buildings 
and 
local Ann Arbor businesses 
such 
as 
Espresso 
Royale 
will 
close 
on 
Wednesday 
and Thursday. Libraries will 
reopen on Friday at 8 a.m. 
The Ross School of Business 
will be locked from midnight 
Wednesday and will reopen 
at 7 a.m. Friday, but faculty 
and staff will be able to enter 
the building. Ann Arbor trash 
and recycling services will 
be delayed for two days. The 
Winter 
Engineering 
Career 
Fair, which was scheduled 
for Wednesday, as well as 
any related interviews and 
recruiting events, have been 
canceled.

According to the LSA website, 
more than 40 languages are 
offered across LSA to fulfill 
the 
language 
requirement. 
The 
number 
of 
language 
courses one must take can be 
minimized for some languages 
by 
completing 
a 
placement 
exam, which, depending on 
how well the student performs 
on it, can exempt students 
from as many as all four 
semesters of the requirement. 
Advanced 
Placement 
credit 
for language courses, among 
other examinations, can also 
aid 
students 
in 
expediting 
the process of completing the 
requirement.
LSA 
last 
reviewed 
the 
language 
requirement 
in 
2004 
and 
upheld 
its 
original 
requirements. 
As 
fewer 
institutions 
require 
undergraduate students to take 
courses in a language other 
than English for two or more 
semesters, LSA continues to 
instill language proficiency of 
four semesters in its students. 
Angela Dillard, the associate 
dean 
for 
Undergraduate 
Education in LSA, wrote in an 
email to The Daily that despite 
other universities’ decisions to 
cut down language departments, 
LSA still believes strongly in 
the benefits of the language 
requirement. 
“Many of us are concerned 
that 
some 
institutions 
have 
begun to eliminate language 
study departments, and to offer 
less and fewer opportunities for 
second language acquisition,” 
Dillard wrote. “LSA remains 
committed 
to 
the 
two-year 
language 
requirement 
and 
to offering a wide range of 
opportunities, 
including 
those in less commonly taught 
languages.”

Students 
have 
expressed 
concerns over the LSA language 
requirement since its conception, 
particularly in terms of its four-
semester length and hefty time 
commitment. Many languages 
are recitation courses, meaning 
they are taught four days a week, 
limiting students’ ability to 
schedule other classes.
Four 
semesters, 
or 
two 
years, are oftentimes only the 
prerequisites 
to 
pursuing 
a 
major or minor in a language. 
In the Romance Languages and 
Literatures 
Department, 
for 
example, five semesters of the 
student’s respective language 
must be completed before they 
can begin working toward the 
major or minor. Some students 
opt for this route, but those who 
are on pre-professional tracks or 
wish to explore other interests 
are boxed into taking a language 
for at least half of their college 
career.
LSA 
freshman 
Natalie 
White is currently enrolled in 
French. After completing four 
years of French in middle and 
high school, she placed into 
French 103, of second-semester 
equivalency. White, who is on a 
pre-medicine track, expressed 
frustration with the fact that 
both her major requirements 
and pre-professional track pose 
a heavy course load, and her 
foreign language requirements 
require the same, if not more, 
time and attention.
“I have a whole major I 
need to finish, and pre-med 
prerequisites I need to finish, 
and now I need to take three 
semesters of this language,” 
White said. “It’s been really 
frustrating because (French is) 
not a low-credit class.”
The 
intense 
hours 
and 
extensive 
course 
work 
surrounding 
the 
language 
requirement 
cause 
some 
students 
to 
question 
the 
purpose of the requirement, and 
whether or not the language 
skills 
they 
acquire 
through 
LSA will help them in the long 
run. The demands of French, in 
addition to her other academic 
commitments, 
have 
pushed 
White to consider transferring 
out of LSA in order to avoid the 
language requirement.
“I really love the school of 
LSA, but if I switch into another 
school I wouldn’t have to take 
this language requirement … 
it’s gotten to that point,” White 
said.
While some students have 
strong opinions against the 
LSA 
language 
requirement 
and 
its 
effectiveness, 
LSA 
administrators and many faculty 
members voice their support for 

the requirement, citing lifelong 
skills that learning a language 
can bring to students.
“LSA’s language requirement 
seeks to prepare students for a 
world that has been profoundly 
transformed by the forces of 
globalization,” the LSA website 
states. 
“Learning 
a 
second 
language provides both a deep 
awareness of linguistic and 
cultural differences and a means 
to bridge them.”
Echoing 
the 
mission 
of 
cultivating cultural awareness 
amid 
globalization, 
Hartmut 
Rastalsky, language program 
director 
for 
the 
Germanic 
Languages 
and 
Literatures 
Department, praised the LSA 
language requirement and its 
ability to create well-rounded 
and cultured students. 
“(Language) 
provides 
students 
with 
intercultural 
skills that will be invaluable 
to them both globally and 
locally, in their professional and 
personal lives,” Rastalsky said. 
“Learning a foreign language 
makes students more aware of 
how their own language works, 
and thus helps them to become 
better and more creative.”
Dillard further emphasized 
the advantages of achieving 
proficiency 
in 
a 
foreign 
language. 
“Language study is (and ought 
to remain) a cornerstone of an 
education in the liberal arts 
and sciences,” Dillard wrote. “It 
gives students a value skill, an 
important way of understanding 
and navigating the world, and a 
competitive edge.”
While 
acknowledging 
the 
importance of having knowledge 
in 
a 
language 
other 
than 
English, White noted the lack 
of enthusiasm and participation 
that exist in the requirement-
level language courses.
“I get the point of having to 
take a foreign language because 
the U.S. is so ignorant to 
understanding other languages, 
but at the same time it should be 
a choice,” White said. “There’s 
nothing worse than sitting in a 
foreign language class and no 
one wants to be there.”
LSA junior Yosef Gross is 
majoring in Spanish and also 
taking courses in Yiddish, but 
placed out of the language 
requirement after taking the 
placement exam. Continuing to 
take languages for fun, Gross 
stressed the importance of using 
language to communicate with 
people from different cultures.
“I think taking a language 
can be a very eye-opening 
experience, because when you 
communicate 
with 
someone 
in their native language … it’s 
like you’re making an effort 
to meet them where they are,” 
Gross said. “A lot of times it can 
lead to more meaningful and 
productive conversations.”
LSA senior Holly Wood is 
currently 
in 
a 
second-year 
Indonesian 
language 
course. 
After 
a 
self-proclaimed 
embarrassing placement exam 
experience 
with 
Mandarin 
Chinese, 
Wood 
decided 
to 
take Indonesian instead. She 
wrote in email to The Daily 
she 
recognizes 
the 
intense 
nature of the requirement but 
understands the overarching 
benefits as well.
“While it is annoying to have 
a language as a requirement, I do 
think it is important for students 
to learn different languages 
and cultures,” Wood wrote. “I 
support the (two) year language 
requirement, especially because 
these 
language 
classes 
get 
students interested in a lot of the 
(culture) on campus.”
To petition the LSA language 
requirement, students must go 
through the Office of Academic 
Standards and Opportunities’ 
Academic 
Standards 
Board, 
which reviews student petitions 
and provides the students with 
substitution culture courses 
if they prove their inability 
to learn a language. Prior to 
petitioning, a student must 
attempt a foreign language 
course, exert a “good-faith” 
effort in the course (including 
near-perfect attendance and 
strong participation), and then 
consult their foreign language 
instructor for assistance in 
seeking an alternative. Students 
can 
find 
the 
information 
regarding the petition process 
if they speak to someone at the 
Office of Academic Standards 
and Opportunities.

“It’s an opportunity for our 
existing fellows and our visiting 
fellows to bring what they’re 
working on to the table within 
a 30-minute to an hour speech,” 
O’Hair said.
Jessica 
Walker, 
an 
LSA 
collegiate fellow in American 
culture, said Wilson’s talk was 
beneficial to her research.
“That notion that architecture 
is an extension of this notion 
of reason, that’s separated by 
Europeans and those who aren’t, 
I think is important to my work,” 
Walker said. “I work on kitchen 
and domestic spaces, and I think 
those also are designed with a 
similar type of, ‘They tell you 
how to cook in whatever nation 
you’re in, and that tells you how 
to be the right class, be a normal 

person, belong to a group,’ food is 
very important to that. So I will 
take that with me especially.”
Wilson 
said 
the 
most 
important discovery she made 
through her research relates to 
the long-standing and intense 
nature of racism in the United 
States’ foundation.
“For me, the biggest revelation 
is that the challenges that the 
United States’ face have their 
DNA back to the founding in 
original 
colonial 
history 
of 
the nation,” Wilson said. “It’s 
not new. At all. So that’s been 
interesting for me at least.”
For Keith Mitnick, an associate 
professor of architecture and 
Institute for the Humanities 
fellow, 
details 
of 
Jefferson’s 
disdain for Black intellect 
 — 
saying the poems of Phillis 
Wheatley, a reknowned African-
Amerian poet, were below the 
dignity of criticism and claiming 

African Americans lacked the 
ability to appreciate beauty or 
comprehend the law, according 
to Wilson’s research — came as a 
surprise.
“A lot of it surprised me,” 
Mitnick 
said. 
“I’m 
from 
Philadelphia, so I grew up with 
a lot of this kind of architecture 
from that period, and Thomas 
Jefferson’s 
always 
celebrated 
as the founding father of this 
idealistic view for a radical 
country that’s departing from 
the English model, and yet you 
find 
out 
how 
deeply-seated 
racism is in our culture, so the 
fact that it’s actually ingrained in 
forms of our architecture is both 
sobering and important to think 
about.”
Wilson later expanded on 
the economic complications of 
slavery and how it relates to core 
American values.
“I think that it’s a complicated 

moral bind that people found 
themselves in. Some of the 
wealthy elites, they let their slaves 
free, because they recognized 
that they can’t say, ‘I believe in 
freedom and yet I hold another 
human in bondage,’” Wilson said. 
“Others, like Jefferson, were 
financially dependent, because 
not only do the slaves work, they 
have value. They’re worth money, 
so it’s like land. So there was this 
huge investment in slaves as 
property, essentially, as well as 
the labor that slaves did in order 
to build the wealth of people. So 
the complexity of the history of 
the slavery and its intertwined 
relationship to American ideas 
of freedom and to mercantile 
and industrial capitalism. It’s 
fascinating and there’s so many 
great scholars and artists doing 
work on the topic. Still much to 
know.”

“They stood by Detroit and 
Detroiters 
stood 
by 
them,” 
Grimm said.
Grimm 
also 
pointed 
out 
Faygo is now owned by National 
Beverage, 
which 
is 
highly 
profitable, despite declining soft 
drink sales, because it produces 

popular sparkling water brand 
La Croix.
Commenting 
on 
the 
presentation, Bandyke said he 
appreciated Grimm’s enthusiasm 
for his research on Faygo. Not 
every author, Bandyke said, can 
fill up their presentation time 
and successfully engage the 
audience.
“You have the feeling that 
this guy just could have talked 

for twice as long and have 
commanded your attention 
for that long,” Bandyke said. 
“Not every author has that 
passion that he does for the 
subject 
matter. 
It’s 
really 
impressive.”
Ann Arbor resident Kathie 
Wilder said she found Grimm’s 
talk very informative, and was 
particularly struck by Faygo’s 
inclusive hiring practices in the 

1960s.
“I thought they were way, 
way ahead of the times,” Wilder 
said. “They were pathfinders, I 
thought.”
Wilder added that as a non-
Michigan native, she was excited 
to taste some of the flavors 
Grimm mentioned.
“I’ll have to try some of these 
unique flavors,” Wilder said.

Though his death was a 

shocking signal to stalwarts 
of the free press, it brought 
to 
light 
the 
impact 
that 

Khashoggi’s trenchant work 
had — both in the U.S. and the 
Middle East.

In 
the 
United 
States, 

the press persists under the 
cumbersome 
weight 
of 
a 

president 
who 
continually 

impugns 
the 
legitimacy 
of 

news and media outlets by 
portraying 
journalism 
as 

an anathema to the nation. 
Despite 
President 
Donald 

Trump’s 
repeated 
attempts 

to undermine the press, we 
have 
seen 
groundbreaking 

reporting across the country. 
From the New York Times’ 
investigative work on Trump’s 
suspicious tax schemes to the 
Miami 
Herald’s 
three-part 

series on how Labor Secretary 
Alexander 
Acosta 
helped 

multimillionaire 
Jeffrey 

Epstein get away with years 
of sex abuse and trafficking, 
journalists 
continue 
to 

diligently pursue the truth 
under 
a 
politically 
terse 

atmosphere.

And here, at the University 

of Michigan, the reporting 
of 
our 
fellow 
classmates 

reinforced how crucial the 
press is on our own campus. 
An article alleging 40 years of 
sexual misconduct by a faculty 
member in the School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance ultimately 
led to the professor’s leave, 
with The Daily’s own Sammy 

Sussman receiving praise from 
the Detroit Free Press for his 
tenacious 
work. 
While 
we 

begin to make our way through 
2019 and uncover new stories, 
we look to these writers with 
admiration and recognize the 
unyielding power of our press.

As students learning how 

to 
understand 
the 
world 

around us, our press continues 
to be a source of guidance. 
No other institution can act 

as a pillar of our democracy 
while 
still 
critiquing 
the 

inevitable 
failings 
of 
our 

government. President John 
F. Kennedy once recognized 
this duality. After receiving 
criticism from the press on his 
Bay of Pigs invasion, he said, 
“Even though we never like 
it, and even though we wish 
they didn’t write it, and even 
though we disapprove, there 

isn’t any doubt that we could 
not do the job at all in a free 
society without a very, very 
active press.” 

It is with this sentiment 

that we encourage students 
to continue supporting the 
tireless work of our writers, 
both 
at

most 
from 
our 
university, 

recognizing when they uphold 
their promises as well as when 
they renege on such pledges. 
This can only be done with a 
robust press, one that is daring 
in its coverage and unafraid 
of delving into every corner 
of every establishment thats 
purported goal is to serve.

Today, on Jan. 30, we’re 

publishing

everyone 
to 
be 
incisive, 

critical, and always demand 
veracity from both our press

The wall and unpopular populism

A

s if a wealthy scion 
and reality TV show 
star leading a white-

collar populist movement wasn’t 
ironic enough. President Donald 
Trump fits every definition of a 
populist, yet he is thoroughly and 
fundamentally unpopular. The 
government shutdown debacle 
over the wall is a perfect example. 
The fact that Trump’s populism is 
so unpopular should be a source of 
relief, but could also be something 
to worry about.

Many political scientists define 

populism as a political strategy, 
applicable on the left or right, 
that claims to represent the “pure 
people” against a class of enemies. 
On the right, these enemies are 
usually minorities and, on the left, 
these enemies are typically the 
wealthy. The leaders of populist 
movements claim to represent 
the direct interests of the people. 
Historian Federico Finchelstein 
argues that modern populism is a 
historical product of World War 
II-era fascism. 

He 
writes 
that 
modern 

populism grew out of fascism after 
fascism was defeated ideologically 
and 
militarily 
by 
liberal 

democracies 
and 
communism 

during World War II.

Federico writes the main 

differences 
between 
modern 

populism and fascism are that 
modern populism has shed the 
violence 
and 
authoritarianism 

of fascism. Most populist leaders 
after World War II, he writes, sell 
themselves as wholly democratic, 
often framing the problem they 
want to solve as anti-democratic. 
Trump, for example, talked about 
the “swamp” or establishment 
politicians as being corrupt or 
“crooked,” 
implying 
he 
was 

somehow the democratic solution 
to the crooked elites whereas 
World 
War 
II 
era 
fascists, 

like Mussolini or Hitler, were 
authoritarian dictators. The other 
main difference is that central 
to fascism is violence and the 
elimination of its enemies. Hitler 
terminated racial enemies and 
Mussolini 
terminated 
political 

enemies. Populists are rarely as 
violent.

The 
connection 
between 

fascism and populism is important. 
Populism is so similar to fascism 
that the wall separating the two 
could 
collapse 
under 
enough 

pressure. As Sheri Berman, a 
professor of political science at 
Barnard College, suggested a large 
enough crisis could lead a society 
dealing with populist politics (like 
ours) into one plagued by legitimate 
fascist political movements. This is 
important to remember in a world 
where populism is rising and 
Donald Trump is our president.

Populism of all sorts tends 

to be bad. Populism is usually 
unpredictable, 
irrational 
and 

anti-empirical. It is often driven 
by emotions and resentment for a 
particular group of people, and it 
conflates the interests of the people 
with those of the populist leader. 
Trump’s populism is concerning 
for these reasons, but also because 
it is so unpopular.

Jennifer 
Rubin 
of 
the 

Washington 
Post 
wrote 
an 

informative 
piece 
about 
the 

unpopularity of Trump’s central 
political objectives. Sixty-eight 
percent of Americans don’t support 
a trade war with China. Nearly 60 
percent of Americans don’t support 
building 
a 
wall. 
Seventy-one 

percent of Americans don’t believe 
undocumented immigrants are 
more likely to commit crimes, 
and 59 percent of Americans 
don’t agree that undocumented 
immigrants are taking jobs from 
native-born 
Americans. 
These 

issues — economic protectionism 
and nativist nationalism — are 
central to Trump’s populist vision.

Trump’s 
unpopularity 
is 

glaringly evident in the recent 
debacle over the funding of his 
“artistic” wall on the Mexican 
border. Forty-eight percent of 
Americans blame Trump for 
the longest shutdown ever. The 
fact that most Americans blame 
Trump for the shutdown indicates 
that his overall populist vision is 
unpopular. The wall is as strong 
of a symbol as any of Trump’s 

nativist, “spurious” nationalism, 
to quote the late Sen. John 
McCain. Populists, to use the 
German sociologist Max Weber’s 
terminology, need to routinize 
their authority. Trump came to 
office riding an oppositional wave. 
He defeated former Secretary of 
State Hillary Clinton, a moderate, 
establishment 
Democrat, 
and 

much of the establishment of 
the Republican Party — the self-
identified “Never Trumpers.” His 
election was an act of cultural 
and political rebellion against 
the commonly accepted arbiters 
of normalcy in the media and 
politics. But you can’t lead a 
country solely with the rebellious 
ethos Trump ran on. Rebellions 
and revolutions of all types, to 
be successful, usually need to 
stabilize into a new status quo and 
sense of normalcy. But Trump’s 
presidency has been everything 
but stable, despite his claim that 
he is a “stable genius.” 

Trump’s 
administration 

has seen an unprecedented rate 
of senior aide turnover and a 
shockingly frequent change of 
senior cabinet members. He has 
left hundreds of key positions 
in government agencies empty. 
He has picked up the habit of not 
reading his intelligence briefings 
and continues to flippantly tweet 
about serious political matters. 
On policy issues, he is continuing 
a trade war with China and 
pursuing an immigration policy 
and a Middle East foreign policy 
that are widely seen as unwise. 
In essence, to govern effectively, 
Trump needs to become less of 
a populist. He needs to be more 
stable and poised. He needs to be 
more rational and empirical. He 
needs to stop acting like a child. 
But after two years in office, 
Trump shows few signs he will 
mature in his role as president.

FROM THE DAILY

#StudentPressFreedomDay

I

n 2018, the international community, the United States 
and our own university witnessed just what kind of 
impact journalists can make. The tragic killing of Jamal 

Khashoggi, a Saudi Arabian Washington Post columnist who 
galvanized both domestic and global readership to encourage 
change in his home country, sent a chilling reminder about 
the precarious nature of being a journalist today.

I

, like many others, believe 
an argument with parents 
to be like a war: It requires 

careful 
preparation 
and 
a 

readiness to risk everything for a 
passionate (and often misguided) 
cause. You have to load up your 
arsenal with arguments that 
dance on being plain spiteful, yet 
are somewhat reasonable enough 
that your parents at least humor 
your futile attempt to win. When 
the fight’s over, you tend to the 
wounds inflicted on your angsty 
emotions and decide whether 
you should keep fighting or admit 
defeat. In other words, fighting 
with parents is essentially a 
mini 
Revolutionary 
War, 
in 

which you are the 13 Colonies 
and your parents are Great 
Britain — except in this version, 
Great Britain wins, and the 
Colonies learn that life, liberty 
and the pursuit of happiness are 
a privilege, not a right, young 
woman!

But with immigrant parents, 

there’s an even bigger disparity 
between the child and parent’s 
ability to win. There’s often 
a disconnect between parent 
and child because the child’s 
primary language is most likely 
English, 
while 
the 
parent’s 

primary language is not. Thus, 
there becomes a situation where 
parent and child can either argue 
with each other in different 
languages, or one person bends 
and argues in a language they’re 
not 100 percent comfortable 
using.

I am this person when I argue 

with my parents. While my 
Korean isn’t bad — in fact, I would 
say that it’s pretty good — I’m 
much more comfortable speaking 
English. 
However, 
arguing 

with my parents in English just 
wouldn’t make sense. I don’t 
speak with my parents in English 

ever, and I understand there’s 

no point in stating a well thought 
out argument if my parents can’t 
completely understand what I’m 
saying. So, when I argue with my 
parents, I feel like I’ve brought 
a mediocre sword to a machine 
gun fight. I know that even if I 
was the creator of the Korean 
language, I would still lose, as 

my parents have the power and 
whatever they say, goes. Still, 
there have been times where I’ve 
privately thought to myself that 
if I had argued with my parents 
in English, I at least could have 
won.

This isn’t an issue I take 

seriously, since most of my 
arguments with my parents stem 
from first-world problems. Do 
I really feel unjustly wronged 
because I couldn’t argue with my 
parents to my fullest capabilities 
about why they should’ve let 
me go to Lollapalooza with my 
friends? No. I also don’t feel as 
though not speaking in English 
has any true impact in the way 
that I communicate with my 
parents. Maybe I can’t quite 
explain to my parents why I need 
to see Drake in person singing 
about how he “used to bus it to 
the dance,” but when I have real, 
serious topics I want to discuss 
with my parents, language-based 
communication issues have never 
hindered our conversations. 

In addition, while there’s a 

language disconnect that exists 
between my parents and me, 
there’s also one that undeniably 
exists 
between 
monolingual 

parents 
and 
children. 
This 

is due to the myriad of slang 
terms, expressions and lines 
of reasoning children use that 
their parents don’t understand. 
Thus, the children have to alter 
their everyday language when 
arguing 
with 
their 
parents 

because otherwise, their parents 
won’t understand what they’re 
saying. While this isn’t true for 
everyone, a vast majority of us 
use language in our everyday 
lives that is completely alien to 
our parents. These differences 
are of course not as stark as 
those that exist between two 
completely different languages, 
but they’re impossible to ignore. 
Even if I did speak English with 
my parents, I certainly wouldn’t 
speak with them the same way 
I do with my friends, not just 
because of the different power 
dynamic between us, but because 
of the generational gap. They 
wouldn’t know half of the terms 
I use with my friends.

It’s strange to think young 

people seem to speak almost a 
different language than their 
parents — it’s a type of code-
switching that comes so naturally 
we don’t even think about it, and 
what implications it has. Are 
we at a disadvantage when we 
speak with our parents? If we 
were able to use the language 
we use when we speak with 
our friends, without fear of our 
parents not understanding us or 
not taking us as seriously, would 
we be able to communicate 
better with them? Our parents 
are not our friends in the same 
way that our actual friends are, 
since there’s always going to be 
an ultimately insurmountable 
(at least, to most of us) instinct to 
view them as authority figures. 
This leads me to believe that 
most of our communication 
issues with our parents stem 
from an uneven power dynamic 
and a generational gap marked 
by different beliefs, rather than 
language differences.

So, while I’m not sure how 

this code switching negatively 
or positively affects the way 
we converse normally with our 
parents, it’s probably for the 
best that we don’t fight with our 
parents the same way we fight 
with our friends and that there 
exists a language disconnect that 
forces children to take on a more 
formal tone. If we spoke to our 
parents the same way that people 
speak to each other in Twitter 
smackdowns, I imagine that our 
relationships with our parents 
would all suffer dramatically 
and more than one kind of 
smackdown would ensue.

Does this language disconnect 

go away as we all get older 
and all get lumped into the 
same, 
slangless, 
nondescript 

category of “old people” by the 
hip, younger generations? Is it 
possible to win in an argument 
against your parents at this 
point? I’m not sure, but I suppose 
I’ll find out in the future.

If Gwyneth Paltrow was a wiry, 
indiscriminately-aged young man 
with the heart of a prophet and the 
social skills of a well-trained ferret, 
the result would most definitely be 
Hark Morner, the titular character 
of Sam Lipsyte’s new novel “Hark.” 
When I initially picked this book up 
off the Arts desk a few weeks ago, 
the rest of the writers were both 
shocked and delighted that someone 
had decided to dive into its bizarre 
mythos. And boy, was it bizarre.
“Hark” is, without a doubt, one of 
the weirdest books I’ve ever read. Off 
the heels of his critically acclaimed 
2004 novel “Home Land” and its 
2010 follow-up “The Ask,” Lipsyte 
has 
established 
himself 
in 
the 
literary world as a sort of satire boy 
genius, continuously challenging 
his readers with underdog male 
leads in scenarios that mirror our 
own world, through a slightly off-
kilter lens. Lipsyte’s writing is just 
as funny as it is uncomfortable, an 
uncanny valley version of today’s 
insane realities. The novel is equal 
parts social commentary and vehicle 
for Lipsyte’s most fascinating fever 
dreams: a fictional “Army of the 
Just” wages an anti-capitalist war 
in Europe next to a talking catfish.
“Hark” surprisingly does not focus 
its narrative around Hark Morner 
himself, but instead on his loyal 
sidekick and spiritual convert Fraz, 
a middle-aged man caught in both 
the whirlwind of Hark’s mythology 

and also a brutal midlife crisis. 
This mythology, named “Mental 
Archery” 
in 
a 
tongue-in-
cheek nod to 
the new-agey 
practices 
of 
today’s health 
nuts, is never 
explained 
in 
full 
detail 
throughout 
the 
book’s 
284 
pages. 
We 
hear 
of 
a 
practice 
called 
“stringing 
the 
bow,” 
get a hint of 
“The Archer’s 
Paradox,” 
hear 
Hark’s 
call to “focus 
on focus” an 
estimated 
hundreds 
of 
times, 
but 
never 
crack 
the surface of 
the 
pseudo-
religion’s 
jargon 
to 
see 
what’s 
underneath.
Instead, the 
antics of Hark 
Morner 
and 
those around 
him function 
as 
whatever 
the 
reader 
imagines them to be, heightening 
the satire of “Hark” to a hectic 

reflection of its audience’s personal 
opinions on the modern era. The 
novel 
almost 
entirely 
operates on metaphor and 
allusion, its foundational 
ideology resting on the 
backs of proverbs like that 
of William Tell shooting 
an apple off a boy’s head, 
of armies tightening their 
bows in battle hundreds 
of years ago, of anything 
and everything archery-
related in the least. “Hark” 
is a narrative wrapped up 
in itself to the maximum 
extent, an arguable feat in 
world-building that works 
to both the story’s benefit 
and disadvantage.
The 
banter 
between 
Fraz, 
Hark 
and 
the 
various cast members that 
Lipsyte attaches to their 
cause along the way is a 
definitive 
highlight 
of 
this world, full of insane 
phrases 
that 
require 
several 
reads 
to 
fully 
understand, 
but 
work 
nonetheless. Right around 
the novel’s midpoint, there 
is an exchange between 
Fraz and one of these 
random 
players, 
Seth: 
“‘Fraz, isn’t a fool,’ Seth 
says, ‘He’s a jester. And 
every smart king needs 
one.’” After Hark offers 
a rebuttal, Fraz explains 
that he is “just a troubled 
bitch.”
This small excerpt of dialogue 
can give anyone the jist of what 

“Hark” is at its core: a brutally 
honest depiction of life among the 
chaos of the modern world. In a 
traditional narrative Fraz would 
be a kingmaker (and is heralded as 
one 
by 
Hark’s 
devotees 
later 
in 
the 
story), 
but here he is 
merely 
a 
guy 
trying not to lose 
his mind in the 
midst of people 
just as crazy, if 
not more, than 
himself. 
In 
Fraz’s 
unhappy 
and 
seemingly 
aimless 
journey 
through 
time, 
the 
novel 
presents a kind 
of eternal male 
shrug found in 
work like David 
Foster Wallace’s 
“Infinite 
Jest,” 
and not in a good 
way. 
Though 
there are bright 
spots within the 
pages of “Hark,” 
the 
desperation 
that hides behind 
each 
character 
hangs over the 
narrative like a 
dark cloud.
The 
base 
elements 
of 
“Hark,” if assembled correctly, could 
have made a hilarious and poignant 
story much like Lipsyte’s own “The 
Ask,” one that balances its brutish 

humor with interesting ideas and 
concepts. Yet the novel stumbles 
too many times for this to fully 
work. There is a difference between 
making a reader uncomfortable for 
a 
predestined 
purpose 
and 
prolonging 
their confusion 
for 
seemingly 
no 
reason 
but 
to 
mess 
with 
their 
perceptions. 
“Hark” 
does 
not walk this 
line carefully, 
and veers from 
solid 
satire 
into 
sad-boy 
sincerity 
in 
a 
zigzagged 
pattern 
that 
is 
nearly 
impossible 
to walk as a 
reader. 
The 
book may be 
a 
product 
of 
our 
time, 
of 
the 
desperate 
clamor 
that 
many 
artists 
feel 
to 
make 
something 
relevant 
to 
the 
current 
political 
and 
social climate. 
Except Lipsyte 
is too obvious in this desire, and it 
is the crux that the value of “Hark” 
balances on, teetering back and 
forth until it falls.

‘Hark’ is what happens when a Sad Boy, satire and 
misguided sincerity walk into a hip, new juice bar

CLARA SCOTT
Senior Arts Editor

In 
a 
desperate 
attempt 
to become even more of a 
caricature of yourself, you 
decide to buy a record player. 
With this record player you 
will officially become defined 
by your owning said record 
player. You talk only of your 
recent record acquisitions and 
how great it feels to buy music 
again after stealing it for so 
many years. You pretend to 
like Jazz because it sounds 
like something that should 
be played on a record player 
and because Ryan Gosling 
tried to save it. You hide your 
speaker from plain sight — if 
you don’t own the record, it 
doesn’t deserve to be heard. 
You acquire a vast collection 
of comedy records to show 
people you have interesting 
interests. You listen to Joan 
Rivers before she got old and 
mean, just mean. You drink 
wine. You do this a lot. 
You post carefully curated 
Instagram stories of your 
ever-expanding 
record 
collection, posing them next 
to your candles and fairy 
lights to create the perfect 
#ambience. You dedicate a 
corner of your room for your 
record player. This corner 
is very cozy. You name your 
record player. The name of 
your record player is Madam 
Spinster. You and Madam 
Spinster spend many evenings 
cuddled together alongside 
Ella Fitzgerald and Julian 
Casablancas. 
One day, Netflix reminds 
you that the new Ted Bundy 
documentary series is out. You 
watch all of season one in one 
day. You have trouble falling 
asleep because you are equal 
parts terrified of and attracted 
to the notorious serial killer. 
You eventually fall asleep 
to Madame Spinster playing 
“The Graduate” soundtrack.
You 
go 
home 
for 
the 
weekend and stumble across 
your 
father’s 
old 
record 
collection. You see a lot of 
Tom Petty, then some Rolling 
Stones, then some more Tom 
Petty. You grab the good 
ones, some David Bowie, a 
Bob Dylan, leave the Tom 
Petty — your dad has a thing 
for him, you guess. You grab 

a Beatles “White Album,” 
feeling like you scored the 
damn lottery. When you get 
home you place the record 
leaning against your dear 
Madam 
Spinster 
in 
eager 
hesitation. You go to class. 
You think of “Hey Jude.” You 
buy an expensive coffee. You 

play “Blackbird” on Spotify. 
When you get home you make 

a steaming mug of tea, kick 
off your snow-covered boots 
and slip into your fuzzy-ass 
slippers that make your feet 
feel equally sweaty and cozy. 
You take the “White Album” 
and ease the record out of its 
case only to discover it is not 
The Beatles’s “White Album” 
but Tom Petty’s Damn the 
Torpedoes.
You pass up plans to go to 
Rick’s in order to hang out 
with Madame Spinster and 
Tom Petty. You are starting to 
like him. You tell your friends 
you are — cough, cough — 
sick. You miss Sunday brunch 
even though you woke up 
at seven, went to the gym 
and then sent 28 emails. It’s 
Monday and you figure there 
is no point leaving the house 
in this weather, this climate, 
this economy. So, you stay 
in, contemplating Nabokov’s 
essays on “Don Quixote” and 
listening to Chopin records. 
You spend 100 dollars on a 
rare Tom Petty album from 
eBay. 
You discover your hair is 
turning a sophisticated grey. 
You find that your wardrobe is 
made up solely of black button 
downs and Ferragamo loafers. 
Your socks are all mismatched 
because you can no longer 
tell what is navy and what is 
black, they just look too damn 
similar. You need bifocals. You 
read James Joyce for fun. You 
complain about your back pain 
and blame it on all those years 
of tennis from way back when. 
You make a photo montage 
of your family vacation to 
Aruba set to Tom Petty’s 
“American Girl.” You send 
links to articles to your family 
group chat with comments 
like “Interesting read!” or 
“Thought you’d appreciate!” 
You 
start 
smoking, 
not 
cigarettes or weed, but cigars 
– expensive ones, Cuban ones. 
The Wall Street Journal starts 
coming to your door every day 
and you don’t know why, but 
you read it, cover to cover. 
You spend 400 dollars on U2 
tickets in Chicago. You don’t 
live in Chicago. 
And then it hits you, like 
the golf clubs you got for early 
retirement. You have become 

It is quite cold outside. You 
are going to listen to vinyl.

DAILY HUMOR COLUMN

BECKY 
PORTMAN

The worst day in American stock market history 
was not in 1929, as one might expect. It actually 
came in Oct. of 1987 — a day dubbed Black Monday, 
when the Dow fell a steep, devastating 22 percent. 
The crash began in Hong Kong, snaked through 
Europe and continued west, an early example 
of the complications posed by a contemporary 
globalized financial system. Nothing, not 9/11 nor 
the collapse of Lehman, has ever eclipsed Black 
Monday, or even come close.
When the dust settled, it wasn’t entirely 
obvious what caused Black 
Monday. 
Computerized 
trading is a popular suspected 
culprit. Others point to the 
weak 
dollar 
or 
previous 
overvaluation. 
There 
isn’t 
one clear, satisfying answer. 
“Until now,” says the opening 
sequence 
of 
Showtime’s 
“Black Monday,” a new gonzo 
comedy set a year prior to the 
crash that promises its own 
imagined explanation.
Mo Monroe (Don Cheadle, 
“Hotel Rwanda”) is the scrappy founder of The 
Jammer Group, an underdog Wall Street firm that 
employs a boorish, ragtag bunch. To orchestrate a 
hostile takeover of the lucrative Georgina Jeans, 
Mo hires the wide-eyed Blair Plaff (Andrew 
Rannells, “Girls”), fresh out of Wharton with 
an algorithm that’s the talk of the trading floor. 
Dawn, the firm’s head trader and lone woman, 
played by the brilliant Regina Hall (“Support the 
Girls”) becomes a sort of audience surrogate who 
can roll her eyes at the frat bros of Wall Street and 
their excesses. And, oh boy, are there excesses. 
Lambo limo? Robot butler? Cocaine? Check, 
check, check.
There is something about ’80s greed that feels 

very interesting right now. Maybe it’s because 
the embodiment of that era currently sits in the 
White House. Or maybe it’s that this moment of 
personal brands and soulless influencer hustle 
seems sprung from a Reaganesque mythos of 
individual responsibility. But “Black Monday,” 
however prescient it could be, never manages to 
say anything insightful about the decade beyond 
big hair, Marion Barry, denim and “Let’s Make a 
Deal.”
Whatever this is, it isn’t a satirical period piece 
so much as it is an overly long “SNL” sketch, 
replete with tedious ’80s jokes and references, a 
few too many of which are anachronistic (Crystal 
Pepsi came out in 1992!). Several of them mine 
audience hindsight for their 
humor: In the second episode, 
a screenwriter shadows Mo as 
research for an untitled Oliver 
Stone movie about Wall Street. 
Deployed with more restraint, 
these would qualify as hidden 
Easter eggs. On this show, 
they’re akin to what might 
happen if Clayton Kershaw got 
his hands on a few cartons of 
Eggland’s Best and decided to 
practice his fastball.
This brand of television — 
surreal, chaotic, irreverent — could probably be 
very good. But “Black Monday” has few ambitions 
beyond shock value. There are some funny jokes, 
but even those are something of a statistical 
inevitability given the show’s joke density — the 
vast majority land flat. Tonally, “Black Monday” 
hasn’t quite decided who we’re supposed to care 
for and how much. And sure, this is difficult to do 
when your show is about inherently unsympathetic 
people in a much-despised industry. But littered 
across the TV landscape are successful examples 
— HBO’s “Succession,” even Showtime’s own 
“Billions.” The characters on those shows are by 
no means lovable, but at the very least, they’re 
worth investing in.

‘Black Monday’ is very OK

SUBLETS

On the cover of Outer Peace, 
singer-songwriter and multi-
instrumentalist Toro y Moi 
sits on an exercise ball in front 
of a glowing computer screen. 
Surrounded 
by 
different 
types of paraphernalia (read: 
keyboards and what appears to 
be a large glass of wine), Toro 
y Moi seems almost boxed in 
by all the various objects that 
help him make music, his gaze 
transfixed on the computer 
screen, backlit by muted tones 
of red, orange and 
yellow. Overall, the 
effect is distinctly 
otherworldly 
— 
a 
gauzy 
dreamscape 
that the album’s title 
seems to reference 
as well. Outer Peace 
provides the surreal 
terrain 
needed 
for Toro y Moi’s 
music to flourish. 
Saturated 
in 
bright, 
electronic-
pop melodies and 
inflated with funk 
and 
R&B 
tunes, 
Toro 
y 
Moi 
has 
never sounded quite 
as carefree as he 
does now. 
In 
the 
scheme 
of 
his 
entire 
discography, 
Toro 
y 
Moi 
seems to try on subgenres like 
different shirts. In 2010, his 
debut album Causers of This 
placed him firmly within the 
chillwave category, garnering 
comparisons 
to 
the 
hazy 
bedroom pop of Neon Indian 
or Tycho. 2011’s EP Freaking 
Out expanded past chillwave 
into a sound that could have 
emerged straight from the 
post-disco revival of the ‘80s. 
2013 saw the release of Say 
That and Toro y Moi’s deep 
exploration 
of 
everything 
house music alongside the 
halting indiosynchries of J 
Dilla-inspired 
loops. 
From 
there, Toro y Moi continued to 
expand and traverse musical 
boundaries, 
collaborating 
with artists such as Nosaj 
Thing, Chromeo and Travis 

Scott, never staying in one 
place 
for 
too 
long. 
After 
Boo Boo’s release in 2017, 
he shifted again — initially 
moving 
from 
Portland 
to 
Oakland and then winding up 
in rural Sonoma County where 
he spent several weeks in 
solitude creating what would 
eventually 
become 
Outer 
Peace.
Even though every Toro 
y Moi project has upheld its 
promise to be vastly different 
than the one that came before 
it, Outer Peace contains the 
most drastic stylistic shift: 
Gone 
are 
the 
wandering 

ambient contemplations, the 
at-times nebulous production, 
the 
lo-fi 
quality. 
Rather, 
Outer Peace emerges like a 
fresh breath of air — crisp, 
distinct, energetic in a way 
that many past projects were 
not. Powered by disco-driven 
melodies and held aloft by the 
perfect fusion of house and 
pop, the album beckons like 
a strobe light — a bright and 
beautiful break from reality 
neatly packaged in distinctive 
rhythms and clean production.
In an interview with Apple 
Music, Toro y Moi stated that 
Outer Peace mainly focuses 
on appraising labor within 
the 21st century. “It’s less of 
a 
love/heartbreak 
record,” 
he said. “It’s more of a you-
can-do-it, 
motivational, 
life-is-hard-because-all-you-

do-is-work record.” Indeed, 
there is a certain optimism 
to each track, a drive to 
keep moving and creating. 
The opening song “Fading” 
shimmers with a pulsating 
effervescence, glitching beats 
interspersing 
with 
soaring 
vocals. “Everything is fading, 
fading, fading / Guess I gotta 
have that faith in, faith in,” 
he says and there is a sense 
of continuation in spite of 
disillusionment, the pursuit 
of organic creativity in spite 
of superficiality. Its a theme 
that carries throughout the 
album, apparent in “Ordinary 
Pleasure”’s “Oh this 
world makes a lot 
of noise / Makes it 
hard to feel what I’m 
thinking,” in “New 
House”’s measured 
inquiry into societal 
expectations, 
in 
“Who 
I 
Am”’s 
electro-dance 
explosion 
of 
self-
exploration.
The 
pinnacle 
of 
Outer 
Peace 
comes through its 
very 
first 
single 
“Freelance.” 
It’s 
here that everything 
Toro 
y 
Moi 
was 
working 
towards 
in 
this 
album 
comes through the 
clearest. The track’s 
polished funk pays homage to 
the spinning kaleidoscope of 
an underground discotheque 
while 
lagging 
programmed 
beats 
climb 
to 
obscurity 
underneath 
Toro 
y 
Moi’s 
monotone drawl. “Nothing’s 
ever 
worse 
than 
work 
unnoticed / Freelance now 
I guess you earned it,” he 
states, 
and 
the 
strained 
notes of futility within his 
proclamation 
are 
at 
odds 
with 
the 
song’s 
buoyant 
production. 
The 
boundary 
between work and life has 
never seemed as blurred as it 
does here, and overarching 
everything is a desire to 
escape. “Cloud hidden and my 
whereabouts unknown,” he 
says over an unceasing beat. 
Disenchantment 
has 
never 
sounded more appealing

Toro y Moi’s ‘Outer Peace’ 
is an appealing fresh start

SHIMA SADAGHIYANI
Daily Arts Writer

Through new-age classics 
like “The Wolf of Wall Street” 
and “Catch Me If You Can,” 
modern 
cinema 
contends 
that a brilliant mind is both 
amazing 
and 
dangerous. 
We can marvel from afar at 
the charisma and genius of 
Jordan Belfort and Frank 
Abagnale Jr., while keeping 
in mind the sobering reality 
that the remarkable visions 
and charming personas that 
launched these two men to the 
top are the very qualities that 
ultimately put them behind 
bars. Belfort and Abagnale 
both rose to the highest of 
highs, living lives of luxury 
and grandeur, only to fall to 
the lowest of lows, serving 
double-digit 
sentences 
in 
federal prison. Reminiscent 
of 
these 
infamous, 
big-

screen-dramatized 
frauds, 
is the story of Fyre Festival: 
a 
shockingly 
catastrophic 
entrepreneurial 
venture 
led by the magnetic, yet 
arguably 
mad 
co-founder 
Billy McFarland. Exposing 
the festival’s failure from 
conception to ashes, Netflix’s 
rendition of the Fyre Festival 
catastrophe leaves audiences 
with mouths agape, horrified 
and in a state of disbelief 
that such a beautiful mess 
actually happened. 
At first, Fyre Festival was 
nothing more than a dream 
of Billy McFarland’s. Already 
a 
successful, 
youthful 
and 
trusted 
entrepreneur 
among the New York upper 
class, 
McFarland 
set 
his 
sights 
on 
advertising 
his 
latest 
undertaking, 
an 

entertainment booking app 
called “Fyre.” What better 
way to do so than with 
a 
massive 
music 
festival 

catered to the millennial 
elite on a private island in the 
Bahamas? Wasting no time, 
McFarland and the rest of his 
posse, including notorious 
rapper and Fyre co-founder, 
Ja Rule, jet off to the Bahamas 
to shoot a sexy promotional 
video with a crew of top 
models. In no time, their 
brainchild transforms into 
the most desirable bucket-
list item for every millennial 
influencer. 
There 
appears 
to be trouble in paradise, 
however, 
as 
McFarland’s 
promises to the festival’s 
investors and guests begin 
to pile up, each emptier than 
the last. Though, money is 
initially enough to patch up 
the holes that McFarland’s 
false claims keep creating, it 
soon becomes clear that Fyre 
Festival is a sinking ship, 
far 
from 
the 
picturesque 
fantasy of models, music and 
lavishness it was intended to 
be.
If one thing is for certain, 
it is that this documentary 
could never fall into the 
unfair yet common stereotype 
within the genre of being dry 
or boring. Watching such 
a visionary and massively 
expensive project collapse to 
literal shambles before our 
eyes, we cannot help but feel 
captivated by the account of 
Fyre’s misfortunes. The film 
rotates between present-day 
interview clips, showcasing 
a mixture of Fyre employees, 
festival goers and journalists 
exposing 
the 
harrowing 
tale of Fyre festival, and 
retrospective 
clips 
about 
the 
festival’s 
construction 
process. 
One 
of 
the 
recurring expressions that 
interviewees hit on over and 
over again is the tremendous 
sensation of guilt. Guilt from 
believing 
in 
and 
sticking 
with McFarland despite his 
growing derangement, guilt 
for 
never 
compensating 
the hundreds of Bahamian 
workers 
responsible 
for 
building 
the 
festival’s 
infrastructure 
and 
guilt 
over all the hoops jumped 
through, lies told, and vows 
un-kept.
If there is one takeaway 
from the film it is this: We 
live in a world ruled by 
appearance. 
If 
something 

looks perfect, framed within 
the dimensions of our iPhone 
screens, 
we 
mistakenly 
decide that it is perfect. The 

illusion of celebrity, affluence 
and extravagance that Fyre 
promoted with yachts and 
models 
to 
its 
influencer 
millennial 
audience 
is 
ironically the same illusion 
Fyre’s 
management 
team 
fell victim to. Hypnotized 
by 
an 
unshakable 
image 
of 
Fyre 
festival 
as 
an 
ethereal paradise, even as 
its foundation was literally 
crumbling, 
McFarland 
couldn’t awake to recognize 
the nightmarish reality of 
what Fyre truly was.
Like all of the juiciest 
stories, the Fyre Festival 
calamity is something that 
must be seen to believe. 
Netflix’s unveiling of this 
unimaginable 
failure 
will 

drop your jaw to the floor, 
set your mind spinning in 
distress and make you count 
your blessings for the simple 
life in good ol’ Ann Arbor, far, 
far away from the mayhem 
that transpired.

‘Fyre’ wasn’t a mess, even 
though the fest really was

Luce, Martin bring stability to inconsistent Michigan defense

To say the Michigan hockey 

team’s 
defense 
has 
been 

inconsistent this season is an 
understatement.

The Wolverines have given 

up the fourth-most goals in 
the Big Ten this season with 77 
goals against — 24 more than 
No. 4 Ohio State, which has 
allowed the fewest goals in the 
conference.

Those goals, though, have 

often come in bunches. Take 
this 
past 
weekend’s 
series 

against No. 15 Penn State, for 
example. 

Michigan 
allowed 
only 

one goal Thursday night and 
then got torched for five goals 
Saturday night. The Wolverines 
have allowed less than three 
goals in 12 of their 25 games 
this season. On the other end of 
the scale, they’ve given up five 
or more goals eight times.

But 
amid 
all 
that 

inconsistency, 
junior 

defensemen Luke Martin and 
Griffin Luce have backstopped 
an 
up-and-down 
group 
of 

blueliners.

“They’ve played well,” said 

Michigan coach Mel Pearson. 
“I think they complement each 
other. They might not be the 
most offensive, prolific guys, 
but this time of year, defense 
wins you hockey games. They 
did that last year, too. They 
played 
extremely 
well 
the 

second half, and they’ve taken 
up where they left off last year.”

On a team filled with two-

way defensemen like sophomore 
defenseman Quinn Hughes and 
freshman defenseman-turned-
forward 
Nick 
Blankenburg, 

Martin and Luce exemplify an 
older brand of blueliner — one 
that lets offense take a backseat 
to focus on defense first.

This season, the pair have 

combined for seven total points. 
Luce tallied his lone point when 
he scored a goal against Western 

Michigan on Oct. 19. Martin has 
chipped in six assists.

Pearson tends to combine 

two-way defensemen with guys 
like Luce and Martin when 
creating defensive pairings, but 
Luce and Martin have played 
together more than half the 
games this season. And once 
he saw how successful the duo 
is when they play together, 
losing some of the offensive 
production that comes with 
having a two-way defenseman 
on the ice didn’t cross Pearson’s 
mind again.

“We’ve discussed that in the 

past,” Pearson said. “We’ve 
talked about our defense — we 
talk almost every week about, 
‘Do we like the pairs, are we 
sure, do we need to change some 
things up?’ They’re playing so 
well that — and we like all our 

pairs. Why change them if you 
like them?”

One of the things that allows 

Luce and Martin to have such 
success together is how long 
they’ve known each other. In 
addition to their three years 
together with the Wolverines, 
they both played on the U-17 
and U-18 teams for the U.S. 
National Team Development 
Program.

And both players agree that 

their friendship is key to their 
success on the ice.

“We’ve been close,” Luce 

said. “We’ve been together here 
for going on five years now, 
so we know each other really 
well. I think when you’re able 
to go and play out with one of 
your best friends (it) definitely 
makes a difference. We have a 
good chemistry going and we 

know each other really well, so 
that makes it easier.”

Martin added: “I think it’s 

just really easy 
to communicate 
with 
(Luce) 

on 
the 
bench. 

There’s no — no 
one’s 
attacking 

anyone 
or 

talking 
about 

a 
play 
or 
a 

bad 
read 
or 

something. 
It’s 

just a lot of open 
communication 
and a lot of trust. We trust each 
other to give each other advice 
and it’s working out well.”

At Michigan, the best friends 

have grown into mirror images 
of each other. They both stand 
6-foot-3 and weigh in only one 
pound apart. Martin shoots 

right-handed and Luce shoots 
left-handed, making them ideal 
matches on a defensive pairing.

When 
you 

combine 
that 

with the pride 
they 
take 
in 

their 
roles 
as 

purely defensive 
defenseman, 
it 
creates 
a 

partnership that 
the 
Wolverines 

can 
count 
on 

in 
just 
about 

any situation — 

particularly on the penalty kill, 
a responsibility both players 
take seriously. In nearly every 
game, both blueliners can be 
found blocking numerous shots 
on the penalty kill and shutting 
down the threat from the 
opponent’s man advantage.

Against the Nittany Lions, 

the duo blocked a combined 
17 shots in the two games — 
including six for Martin and 
five for Luce in Thursday 
night’s win.

“They’ve taken some pride 

in penalty killing,” Pearson 
said. “They’re blocking shots. 
They’re doing all those little 
things you need to do to win 
and have success.

“(Blocking shots) especially 

on the power play (is) really 
important. 
It’s 
gonna 
be 

important 
this 
weekend. 

Minnesota has got a really 
good power play. In conference, 
they’re operating at about 30%, 
which is unheard of. They 
scored six power-play goals last 
weekend against Wisconsin, 
so you’re gonna have to get in 
shooting lanes and block shots.”

And 
speaking 
of 
the 

upcoming series against the 
Golden Gophers, the fact that 
Minnesota plays on an Olympic-
size ice sheet adds a layer of 
difficulty to Martin and Luce’s 
jobs this weekend. The ice is 15 
feet wider than the ice at Yost 
Ice Arena, leaving more space 
for the defensemen to cover.

But both are up for the task.
“They recruit to their ice, 

I’ve always thought, so they 
have really small, fast guys 
who are really good at playing 
in the corners on that ice,” 
Martin said. “It’s just staying 
in 
between 
the 
dots 
and 

recovering extra hard. (Luce) 
and I backing each other up will 
be key this weekend.”

This weekend’s series against 

the Golden Gophers is key for 
the Wolverines as they try to 
string together some wins to 
get into the NCAA Tournament 
conversation.

And 
with 
Martin 
and 

Luce 
adding 
much-needed 

consistency 
and 
calm 
to 

Michigan’s defense, a strong 
performance from the two of 
them may be the answer for the 
Wolverines.

Junior defensemen Luke Martin and Griffin Luce have provided stability to a defense and a penalty-kill unit that has otherwise been inconsistent this season.

Naz Hillmon thriving in role, 
ready for potential of more

It’s rare for a freshman to 

rank second on her team in 
scoring. Even more so when that 
freshman shoots over 68 percent 
from the field and comes off the 
bench.

Naz Hillmon — the forward 

who has become one of the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team’s top contributors and one 
of the Big Ten’s biggest rising 
stars — has been a revelation 
for the Wolverines this season, 
currently ranking fifth in the 
nation in field goal percentage 
(68.5) while also putting up 12.6 
points per contest. Despite being 
a bench player, she has found 
ways to make an impact and 
make the most of her role.

“Coming off the bench, you 

can see everything a lot better 
than a starter would just because 
you can take from the sidelines 
and see how your opponent is 
scoring as well as how you’re 
scoring,” Hillmon said.

While she is currently playing 

a key role as the team’s sixth 

man, Hillmon could potentially 
find herself in the starting 
lineup for Thursday night’s 
home contest against Iowa after 
senior forward Nicole Munger 
suffered a devastating injury 
in Sunday’s 77-73 loss against 
Michigan State. Michigan will 
need someone to step up if its 
senior 
captain 
is 
sidelined. 

Luckily, it has Hillmon waiting 
in the wings.

Hillmon, who admitted that 

she doesn’t know anything about 
Munger’s status, says that she is 
prepared to make the jump to 
the starting five if needed.

“It’ll be a difference,” Hillmon 

said. “But I just know that I just 
have to be locked in and ready 
to go whenever my number is 
called.”

After Sunday’s tough loss, 

Michigan now sits at 3-6 in 
the Big Ten conference and 
12-9 overall. While most teams 
would be discouraged by a 
subpar record, the Wolverines 
believe they are close to a 
breakthrough and, after a series 
of tight conference losses, are 
doing what they can to right the 

ship. Rather than focusing on 
what could have happened had 
these nailbiters gone the other 
way, Hillmon says that the team 
is focusing on looking forward. 
On the court, Hillmon could be 
part of a solution.

“Right now we know that we 

have some work to do, but we 
also know what that is,” Hillmon 
said. “In practice, every day we 
wanna keep trying to work at it 
and get those close games to flip 
the other way.”

One thing Hillmon has been 

working on is developing a mid-
range shot. While she admitted 
that the shot has never been a 
major part of her arsenal, she 
said that she’s doing her best 
to extend her range in order 
to open up more space for her 
teammates. Though she made 
a free throw line jumper in 
Sunday’s 
contest, 
Hillmon 

cautioned that “it’s not there 
yet,” 
but 
added 
that 
she’s 

“getting 
more 
comfortable” 

from that range.

Could a 3-pointer be next?
“I’ll have to make some in 

practice first.”

‘M’ wins 4-1 at ITA Kick-Off

Coming off a disappointing 

4-3 loss to No. 22 Alabama, 
the No. 24 Michigan men’s 
tennis team had tremendous 
motivation 
to 
succeed 
on 

Saturday at the ITA Kick-Off 
against North Carolina State.

Besides wanting to notch 

their first win of the season, 
it was the first time that the 
Wolverines had hosted the 
event and they wanted to prove 
that they could compete with 
the other teams participating, 
since the winner would earn a 
spot in the ITA National Team 
Indoor Championship.

“It means a lot. I told the 

guys yesterday that it took 
a lot of work to get here,” 
said Michigan coach Adam 
Steinberg, “I told them we have 
to take advantage of it though. 
We can’t just be happy to be 
hosting. Our goals are way 
bigger.”

And take advantage they 

did. After dropping the first 
game, the duo of sophomore 
Mattias Siimar 
and 
freshman 

Andrew 
Fenty 

won six straight 
to 
win 
their 

match 
6-1. 

Freshman 
Patrick Maloney 
and 
senior 

Myles 
Schalet 

also took care of 
their Wolfpack 
opponents with 
relative ease, winning 6-2, 
and giving the Wolverines the 
doubles point.

“Doubles was unbelievable,” 

Steinberg said. “That’s the best 
I’ve seen us play doubles in a 
really long time. That was the 
biggest positive obviously.”

Michigan did not have much 

difficulty in the singles portion 
of the day either. While Siimar 
lost his match, giving NC State 
its only point, every other 
Wolverine player either won 
their match or had the lead 
when play ended.

Schalet 
capped 
off 
an 

impressive day with a win in 

straight sets, 6-3, 6-3. Senior 
Gabe 
Tishman, 
the 
only 

Michigan singles player to not 
participate in doubles, had 
possibly the most dominant 
singles win for the Wolverines, 
6-0, 6-4, while junior Connor 

Johnston 
won 

6-4, 7-5 to give 
Michigan 
the 

deciding 
point 

and a 4-1 win.

“Connor 
at 

four, and how 
he’s 
played 

the 
first 
two 

matches 
is 

a big lift for 
our 
team,” 

Steinberg said. 

“He didn’t really play singles 
his first two years and now he’s 
playing high and he’s doing 
great.”

Added Fenty: “To come out 

here and win, and the way we 
did, with that much intensity 
and that much passion, it’s kind 
of sick.”

After their win over the 

Wolfpack, 
the 
Wolverines 

looked to take the momentum 
from 
Saturday’s 
win 
into 

Sunday as they took on No. 
11 Baylor for a spot in the 
ITA National Team Indoor 
Championship in February.

“We’re just trying to use it 

and ride the wave,” Fenty said. 
“The way we’re playing right 
now we feel like we could beat 
anyone.”

Added 
Steinberg: 
“That’s 

what we practice for. That’s 
what these guys live for, to 
go to the National Indoors. It 
doesn’t get better than that. I 
know the guys are excited.”

Michigan would go on to 

lose a hard-fought match 4-1 on 
Sunday, with their only point 
coming in doubles.

While the weekend did not 

end as they would have liked, 
the Wolverines proved that 
they can play with anyone.

Coach Adam Steinberg was pleased with Saturday’s bounceback performance.

That’s the best

Position review: Quarterbacks

With 
the 
Michigan 
football 

team’s 2018 regular season in the 
books, The Daily looks back at the 
performance of each unit this year 
and peers ahead to the future in 
2019. In this edition: quarterbacks.

Coming off a 2017 season 

handicapped by poor quarterback 
play — one which ended with John 
O’Korn in tears at the podium 
after the Ohio State game — even 
average quarterback play would 
have sufficed. 

In 2018, Shea Patterson cleared 

that low bar with room to spare. 

Patterson 
threw 
for 
2,600 

yards, the highest total since Jake 
Rudock in 2015. He threw for 22 
touchdowns, the most since Chad 
Henne also posted 22 in 2006. His 
touchdown to interception ratio — 
22-to-7 — was the best since Drew 
Henson’s in 2000. 

There’s a very real case for 

it being the best season from a 
Michigan quarterback this decade. 
In fact, it might not even warrant 
an argument.

Whether that surpassed the 

massive expectations planted on 
Patterson after his transfer from 
Ole Miss is subject to personal 
evaluation. He did not merit All-
Big Ten or All-American selection. 
He was no “savior of the program,” 
as some optimistically posited. But 
one thing is clear: With Patterson 
at the helm heading into 2019, the 
Wolverines are as comfortable at 
quarterback as they’ve been in 
quite some time.

HIGH POINT: The Michigan 

offense got the ball back in the 
middle of the fourth quarter 
with a four-point deficit and a 
quarterback oozing confidence.

Just hours earlier, Northwestern 

had jumped out to a 17-0 lead in the 
first half, threatening to derail the 
Wolverines’ season before it even 
took flight. With one loss already 
under their belt, a loss to the 

Wildcats would have effectively 
served as a death knell.

Slowly but surely, Patterson 

helped awaken Michigan’s offense 
from its prior doldrums. Then he 
orchestrated a decisive 11-play, 
67-yard drive in 5:59 to grab a 
20-17 lead that would soon become 
final.

On the drive, Patterson showed 

the tools that made him effective 
all year. He rushed for nine yards 
into Northwestern territory on 
a key 3rd-and-6. Then, two plays 
later, he rifled a missile to the back 
shoulder of tight end Zach Gentry, 
sending Gentry lumbering down 
to the six-yard line.

Above all, he showed the moxie 

to carry the sputtering Wolverines 
out of Evanston with a win when 
the alternative seemed inevitable 

all evening.

“I just know there’s something 

about him,” said fifth-year senior 
defensive end Chase Winovich 
after the game. “I saw it the very 
first time we had met. He was a 
major factor in me coming back 
because there’s just an aura about 
him. … He’s a football player.

“But something about Shea is 

special. People can see it. Being on 
the team with him, you can feel it.”

LOW 
POINT: 
Somewhere 

between the first interception and 
the second interception, Michigan 
viscerally lost hope.

Much of what derailed in the 

Peach Bowl was out of Patterson’s 
control. Florida rushed 40 times 
for 257 yards, eviscerating the 
porous, under-manned Wolverines 
defense. Michigan’s leading rusher 

in the game, Christian Turner, 
totaled just 32 yards.

But a stinging 41-15 defeat falls 

in part at the feet of its leaders — 
and Patterson earned his share 
of the blame. For him, the game 
represented an opportunity to 
move past the debacle at Ohio 
State. He had a chance, playing 
without many of the departing 
stars, to usher in optimism for the 
year ahead with his play and his 
demeanor. A chance, in short, to 
lead.

Patterson’s sloppy play did 

nothing of the sort. 

The junior quarterback ended 

the day with middling statistics — 
236 yards, one touchdown and two 
interceptions on a season-high 
36 attempts. In the first quarter, 
he guided the lone touchdown 

drive with three pinpoint throws, 
including a back-shoulder pass 
to Donovan Peoples-Jones for a 
score.

It was that ease which made the 

ensuing stagnation all the more 
frustrating.

Early in the first half, Patterson 

tried to throw a deep post-route 
to Nico Collins. Underthrown 
and misread, Patterson’s pass fell 
easily into the arms of Florida 
safety Chancey Gardner-Johnson, 
symbolically turning the tide of 
the game. From there, the Gators 
scored 28 of the game’s final 
33 points, including a 30-yard 
Gardner-Johnson pick-six to twist 
the knife already entrenched in 
the Wolverines’ back.

Patterson doesn’t assume all 

the fault for the loss, of course. 

And the loss, in a vacuum, changes 
little about the overall outlook of 
Michigan’s season, one congruent 
with the ethos of Michigan football 
these days: just good enough to 
tantalize, not good enough to win 
anything meaningful.

But 
the 
Peach 
Bowl 
was 

Patterson’s 
to 
seize. 
Having 

already announced his return, 
Patterson held the trajectory of the 
program and the present mentality 
of the team. The ambivalent 
performance did nothing to satisfy 
either.

THE 
FUTURE: 
In 
terms 

of present upside and future 
depth, Michigan’s quarterback 
room is in as good a position as 
it’s been in over a decade. While 
Patterson enters next season as 
the presumed incumbent, Joe 
Milton and Dylan McCaffrey both 
offer future starting quarterback 
potential. 

McCaffrey 
showed 
brief 

glimpses of that potential in 2018. 
He completed 4-of-6 passes and, 
anecdotally, looked comfortable 
in relief duty at Notre Dame. He 
rushed for a 44-yard touchdown 
against Wisconsin and had an 
80-yard rush called back on a 
holding call against Nebraska. In a 
mop-up appearance against Penn 
State, though, McCaffrey injured 
his collarbone and was out for the 
remainder of the year.

For Milton, the hype remains 

just that — largely centered around 
whispers of practice feats here and 
there and one 60-yard missile 
against Ohio State. He didn’t 
clear the four-game threshold, 
remaining eligible for a redshirt 
if he and the coaching staff so 
choose.

With Patterson in tow, and 

highly-regarded new coach Josh 
Gattis in control of the offense, 
there’s reason for tepid optimism 
ahead of 2019. Amid an offense 
returning most of its core, the 
quarterback position represents 
one of the team’s biggest strengths.

In 2018, Shea Patterson helped lift Michigan’s quarterback room to new heights. What’s in store next year and beyond?

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily

Junior quarterback Shea Patterson threw for 2,600 yards, 22 touchdowns and just seven interceptions, returning in 2019 to headline a strong quarterback room.

Simpson leads way with triple-double in 65-49 win over Ohio State

Kaleb Wesson barked at Zavier 

Simpson. 
He 
was 
frustrated 

with the junior guard’s relentless 
defense after Simpson blocked a 
shot seemingly out of nowhere.

Simpson, of course, barked 

back.

It wasn’t long before both teams 

got involved, exchanging words 
and shoves before the refs broke 
it up.

In the end, both teams got two 

technicals plus a common foul on 
the Buckeyes. Junior center Jon 
Teske sunk both free throws and 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team — buoyed by a chorus of boos 
— had all the momentum against 
Ohio State. The Wolverines scored 

five straight points afterward 
to cap off a 9-0 run and extend 
Michigan’s 
lead 

to 18.

“That’s 
our 

motivation, when 
things get chippy 
in 
the 
game,” 

Simpson 
said. 

“We 
thrive 
off 

that. That hungers 
us, keeps us going. 
That 
makes 
us 

wanna make the 
next best play.”

And the Buckeyes’ frustration 

with 
Simpson 
started 
long 

before the fight. On the previous 
possession, Simpson hit a 3-pointer 
to break up a three-minute scoring 
drought. Before that, he was 
a constant presence, grabbing 

boards left and right and dishing 
out assists. He finished with a 

triple-double, 
the first of his 
career — scoring 
11 
points, 
10 

rebounds and 12 
assists and acting 
as the Wolverines’ 
catalyst 
in 
its 

65-49 win.

The Buckeyes 

stymied 
Michigan at first 
with 
different 

defensive looks, including a three-
quarters trap and a 2-3 zone. The 
Wolverines couldn’t get any shots 
to fall — for two or for three. Ohio 
State, though, gave the ball away 
and fouled so frequently that it 
minimized its own volume of 

chances. In the first minute of the 
second half alone, the Buckeyes 
had two fouls and 
two giveaways.

Parts 
of 
the 

game 
seemed 

like an exercise 
in 
not 
scoring. 

But 
despite 
its 

lack of efficiency, 
Michigan 
generated enough 
chances to build 
up a lead. On one 
possession, Poole 
missed two triples before finally 
making the third. Two minutes 
later, 
Ohio 
State 
committed 

another turnover late in the shot 
clock. Sophomore forward Isaiah 
Livers hit a 3-pointer on the other 
end to give the Wolverines their 
first lead of the game.

From there, the shots started 

falling. Michigan took the lead 

for good on a trey 
by redshirt junior 
wing 
Charles 

Matthews 
and 

finished with 10 
3-pointers on 37 
percent shooting 
from beyond the 
arc

“(We) 
were 

confused a little 
bit and once we 
got 
a 
rhythm 

for it, we started to play with a 
better rhythm, whether it was 
zone or man in the first half,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“In the second half they played 
a couple sets of zone and I think 
(Poole) hit a three and somebody 
else hit a three and they didn’t play 

zone anymore.”

During the final media timeout, 

two 
assistants 
whispered 
to 

Simpson a simple message: “Get 
another rebound.” It was then that 
he realized he was approaching 
a milestone. With 2:49 left in the 
game, following a missed jumper, 
he finally got his 10th.

“My teammates, they told me to 

get it,” Simpson said. “So having 
it come up, two of them could’ve 
gotten the rebound. I’m like, ‘Hey, 
I’m here.’ They kinda let it bounce. 
… That means a lot.”

A minute later, Simpson was 

called for a foul and removed 
from the game, but instead of the 
usual boos to accompany such 
a call, Simpson exited to cheers 
of “triple-double” and “Zavier 
Simpson” and then, finally, a 
standing ovation.

Daily Sports Writer

EVAN AARON/Daily

Sophomore point guard Zavier Simpson posted a triple-double Tuesday night, with 11 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists.

That’s our 
motivation, 

when things get 

chippy...

Parts of the 
game seemed 
like an exercise 
in not scoring.

veryone remembers the kid who 
sat next to you in high school and 
conveniently turned his head 
toward your Scantron to “cough” during 
an exam. Even worse are the ones who 
peer pressured you into letting them copy 
the entirety of your homework. Copycats 
are a nuisance — a fly you just can’t seem to 
swat for good. Even in the team-oriented 
corporate world, there are colleagues who 
ride the coattails of your work. But what 
happens when a $700 billion company 
strategy is rooted in these very grounds?
Apple has created an ecosystem that 
most students at the University of Michi-
gan have bought into. Send a text on your 
iPhone, track your workout on an Apple 
Watch, write your essays on a Macbook 
and indulge in your morning podcast on 
those AirPods. When you run out of stor-
age, make sure to upgrade your iCloud 
storage for only 99 cents. Every picture 
you take, place you go, thought you have 
and person you talk to circles back to 
these environs. But beware: The ecosys-
tem comes with a side effect of allegiance. 
The easiest way to start a friendship on 
the wrong foot is observed when you care-
fully type a new number into your phone 
and watch the green text fail to turn blue.
When the iPod became wildly suc-
cessful after its release in 2001, Apple 
looked ahead and accurately predicted 
the inevitable smartphone takeover. Thus, 
it quietly began creating the iPhone. The 
iPhone was groundbreaking when its first 
few models came into fruition, capturing 
3.4 percent of the smartphone industry’s 
market share within the first quarter on 
the market. And by 2012, the iPhone made 
up more than half of Apple’s revenue.
A quick glance at Samsung and Apple’s 
timelines show the iPhone broke grounds 
first. The debut iPhone was released 
in January of 2007, while the Samsung 
Galaxy was released in 2010. While the 
first 8GB iPhone cost a whopping $600 
(approximately $740 today), it was widely 
regarded as the most anticipated gadget 
of the decade, and thus saw booming suc-
cess. But since its first few models, Apple 
has let its branding and consumer loyalty 
take the lead, working in the shadows of 

Samsung while carrying the gold 
medal.
Excited for the AirPower wire-
less charging technology set to 
release later this year? Samsung 
debuted this capability back in 
2015, even featuring it in an ad 
mocking Apple. Tired of getting 
the “Not Enough Storage” notifi-
cation right as you’re about to snap 
the perfect photo? Samsung intro-
duced microSD expandable mem-
ory in 2014 with the Galaxy S5 — it 
can now expand up to 400 GB. And 
while your water-resistant 2016 
iPhone 7 may save your life during 
a poolside Instagram photoshoot, 
the Samsung Note7 introduced 
waterproof technology that same 
year, after implementing water 
resistance since its S4 in 2013. The 
2016 Note7 also debuted facial rec-
ognition technology, which Apple 
picked up for its iPhone X in late 
2017.
The 
mimicry 
pattern 
runs 
deeper than surface-level fea-
tures. After Steve Jobs bashed 
OLED screen technology in 2012, 
Tim Cook ultimately implement-
ed it in the Apple Watch in 2015, 
then the Macbook and iPhone 
soon after for better picture quality and 
power efficiency. But while Samsung has 
used OLED screens since its 2010 Nexus 
S, Apple deserves some credit, as OLED 
technology has been argued to be primi-
tive until used in Apple products.
Though the Samsung versus Apple 
rivalry can often feel as bitter as that of 
Coke versus Pepsi, what many tend to 
forget is that Samsung actually produces 
a substantial number of processors and 
OLED screens for Apple. While their sup-
plier relationship altered in 2018 with 
Apple’s decision to bring on a second 
OLED supplier to reduce their reliance on 
Samsung, the South Korean mogul once 
made $110 off of every iPhone X that was 
sold. And while both companies continue 
to play tag in legal battles year after year, 
they still lead a critically symbiotic rela-
tionship. As they say, keep your friends 

close, but keep your enemies closer.
It is hard to deny Apple is winning in the 
smartphone race in the U.S. Despite Sam-
sung being a global leader in market share, 
their smartphone market share in the U.S. 
hovers near 25 percent, while Apple’s sits 
at 45 percent. Apple was also the largest 
company by market cap last year, while 
Samsung took 12th place. Beyond getting 
kids acclimated to their products through 
elementary school classrooms equipped 
with iPads and Macs, Apple also continues 
to offer features that are deeply integrat-
ed in our daily lives: iMessage and Face-
Time. It can be argued Apple is leading in 
the U.S. because of these features, while 
other countries use third-party apps, such 
as WhatsApp, and thus find more value in 
Samsung products. While Samsung often 
innovates earlier, Apple still capitalizes 
on a rare pairing of luxury branding and 
ubiquity to hold on tight to their domi-

nance.
But perhaps Apple’s lack of innovation 
will eventually catch up to them. Three 
months ago, Goldman Sachs slashed 
their stock price forecast of Apple, citing 
a lack of success in China as well as the 
iPhone XR’s flop in performance. And just 
4 weeks ago, Apple announced they too 
are slashing their own revenue forecast 
for these same reasons, ultimately caus-
ing their stock price to plummet by 10 
percent. Minor model changes and steep 
price jumps may no longer be the ticket to 
success in Apple’s playbook.
You can only play copycat for so long. 
But for now, as enticing as cutting-edge 
technology and waterproof systems are, 
no one wants to be a pixelated Snapchat, 
or worse: a green text message.

A short 
appreciation for 
The French New Wave

BY KATE GLAD, STATEMENT DESIGNER

Wednesday, January 30, 2019 // The Statement 
3B

F

ilms are meant to, among other 
things, transport their audience. 
It is an art form with the ability 
to invite viewers to spend a night in the 
humid Hong Kong air, heavy with stolen 
glances and stolen spouses. Or hold 
the audience’s hand through the many 
dialects of the Chinese language as the 
director escorts viewers through the 
subtleties of a character’s sadness, as in 
“In the Mood for Love.” A film is also 
a window into a French dairy country 
cabin in World War II with pipe smoke 
snaking around, as in the opening 
scene of 2009’s “Inglourious Basterds.” 
Or perhaps they prefer to stay in their 
Greenwich Village apartment — the one 
with the “Rear Window.”
But the movement I want to talk 
about exists in a different place and 
time entirely — The French New Wave. 
It disturbed the streets of Paris and 
wreaked havoc on the paradigms of 
cinema. The French New Wave didn’t 
just transport the audience — it also 
facilitated and created a transition in 
the way filmmakers think about the art 
form.
Starting in 1958 and continuing into the 
late ’60s, The French New Wave, known 

in French as the “La Nouvelle Vague,” 
sought to make films in a different style 
than the hyper-continuous aesthetic 
that had originated in Hollywood. 
Directors like François Roland Truffaut, 
Jean-Luc Godard and Jacques Demy 
created a new language for film that 
gave the audience more credit. They 
believed their viewers would not only 
enjoy the narrative stories they told, 
but would also understand the artistic, 
formal choices having to do with time. 
According to the title of Andrei 
Tarkovsky’s legendary book, cinema 
is “Sculpting in Time.” Until the New 
Wave, time on film was replicated as 
close to reality as possible: Days or 
weeks were sometimes compressed 
with a dissolve transition technique if 
a story had to be told over a long time, 
but still allowed the narrative beats to 
unfold minute by minute. New Wave 
directors abstracted time in two main 
ways: jump cuts and real time sequences. 
Both equally revolutionary and equally 
upsetting to the establishment, these 
techniques allowed for more complex 
stories to be created and began to really 
expand cinematic artistry beyond the 
page.

”

T

his past summer, I found out 
that my Bursley Residence 
Hall housing assignment had 
been moved from a mixed-gender hall 
to a same-gender hall. It really wasn’t a 
big deal — I knew it might happen and 
I still had a decent room. But I was still 
struck with this irrational nervousness 
for something I shouldn’t have been ner-
vous about.
I’m a girl. I have friends who are girls. I 
already knew half of my floormates from 
living with them last year and I knew 
they were all really nice. A same-gender 
hall shouldn’t have been an issue, and 
rationally, it wasn’t. But as the days crept 
closer and closer to September, I found 
myself getting more and more anxious 
about living in that hall. I kept trying to 
bring it up to friends, subtly, with lines 
like, “Hey, it’s gonna be strange living in 
an all-girls hall, haha!” and they’d just 
respond with, “Why is that an issue?” 
Which I totally get, because it really isn’t 
an issue, but there was still something 
worrying me that I couldn’t seem to 
make people understand. 
One of my friends even said, “You 
know, for a lesbian, that’s kind of sex-
ist.” It wasn’t the first time that I tried 
to explain how my reservations were 
not grounded in dislike, but rather, I just 
didn’t know how to deal with girls. 
Women can be awesome. I’d be the 
first person to say that. I’m the “raging 
feminist” of my family. I’ve marched, 
called representatives, and signed peti-
tions for gender equality and women’s 
rights. The theme of my cartoon in The 
Daily is “women’s issues.” But there’s a 

difference between large-scale societal 
issues and complex personal relation-
ships, and I still couldn’t shake the anxi-
ety of living in an all-girls hall.
I used to be a hostess at this fancy 
restaurant where I was the only young 
woman on the waitstaff. It was just me 
and a bunch of 20-something waiter 
guys and it was chill. We’d talk about 
hair gel and salsa dancing and how much 
we hated our customers. I slipped into 
my “dude-bro” voice, the one that sounds 
like every stoned surfer I grew up with. 
They still treated me differently because 
I was a girl, of course — it took time for 
them to warm up to me. But once that 
initial awkwardness left, I had it figured 
out easy.
About a month later, another hostess 
was hired. She was my age, but nothing 
like me. Long hair, high heels, YouTube-
tutorial makeup. We were stuck togeth-
er at the hostess stand for hours, with 
nothing to say to each other. It was like 
we came from different ecosystems, and 
scientists were just now putting the two 
species in the same habitat to see how 
they would interact.
Eventually, this hostess started talk-
ing to me, most likely because she real-
ized that she could talk about anything 
for as long she wanted and I wouldn’t 
object. Her musing about her personal 
life was better than nothing. She told 
me about her college applications, her 
sisters and most of all, her ex-boyfriend. 
One day she came in to work and said, 
“Emily, I’ve finally figured out what I 
want in a man. He needs to be attractive. 
Physically.” This mutual rapport lasted 

for a few shifts, but then it all went to 
hell. 
One day, she asked me if I ever had 
any boyfriends, and I responded, pretty 
plainly, “I’m gay.” My remark was met 
with a one-word response, “oh.” And 
then she was silent. I don’t know if it was 
deliberate, and I want to give her the 
benefit of the doubt that it wasn’t, but she 
didn’t talk to me much after that.
I’m pretty familiar with the whole 
straight-girl-suddenly-gets-really-
uncomfortable-and-then-the-friend-
ship-is-kinda-over thing. 
It’s been happening since I was a kid, 
even before I really understood it, to the 
point where I’m always a little surprised 
when straight girls are kind to me. It’s 
really cool when they are, but there’s 
a part of me that’s always suspecting 
they’re going to realize they hate me and 
tell me to leave them alone.
Honestly, that’s a terrible way to think. 
It’s its own kind of prejudice. I approach 
too many straight girls with the expecta-
tion that they’re not going to want to be 
around me, or that we don’t have enough 
in common. This belief directly influ-
ences who I befriend and spend my time 
with. I know, it’s pretty messed up.
I think I’ve gotten better at checking 
those assumptions since I’ve arrived at 
college. At least, I hope so. But some-
times, I still get paranoid, and I can’t fig-
ure out if it’s me or someone else who has 
the problem. Is that girl being rude to me 
because she’s running late, or because 
I have short hair? Is she avoiding me 
because she’s busy, or because I make 
her uncomfortable? I don’t know. 

I don’t make it easy for myself — my 
haircut and clothes and lack of makeup 
all signal “this kid never grew out of the 
tomboy phase.” I know that is not how 
it works. But that doesn’t stop me from 
believing people are thinking it. 
My freshman year, I went to an audi-
tion for a campus dance group. I had 
been dancing since I was five, so I had 
been trying out for a few ensembles, 
thinking I might have a shot. However, 
the moment I walked into this audition, I 
immediately felt every girl’s eyes on me. 
Glaring. A room of leggings and pony-
tails and the unshakable thought that 
every single person there wanted me 
gone. Like in a staring contest I wasn’t 
prepared for, I made it 20 minutes before 
blinking. I sighed. I mean, what was the 
point? They weren’t going to want me on 
their team. So I just left.
I’ve been living on this all-girls hall 
since September now, and it has obvious-
ly been fine. Everyone is nice, support-
ive and fun to be around. Looking back, 
there was genuinely no good reason to be 
nervous in the first place.
But that anxiety still sticks around. 
Despite being a woman myself, when-
ever I’m in majority-women spaces — 
whether it’s in a bathroom, a classroom, 
or a party — I keep catching myself wor-
rying if I’m making someone uncomfort-
able by being there.
Maybe someday I’ll get over it. In the 
meantime, I’ll enjoy this hall while I’m 
on it. However, not accidentally, I’m the 
only woman living in my apartment next 
year.

NIGHT SHIFT 
ESSAYS

NIGHT SHIFT

On straight girls and social spaces

I 

am a constellation of contradictions. I eat 
vanilla and chocolate ice cream, often mix-
ing the two together or finding a flavor some-
where in between. I listen mostly to indie music 
and classic vinyl, but I indulge in the stylings of top 
40 pop from time to time (yes, I still like Maroon 
5, what of it!). I enjoy serious and silly movies, 
from “The Godfather” and “Eternal Sunshine of 
the Spotless Mind” to “She’s the Man” and “White 
Chicks.” But perhaps my greatest personal paradox 
is that I’m an “ambivert,” or rather, both an intro-
vert and an extrovert.
For most of my life, I thought I was just an intro-
vert. From elementary to middle school, I was pain-
fully shy, riddled with social anxiety and frequently 
desired to do things on my own. In class, I pre-
ferred working independently as opposed to group 
projects. At home, I read books, drew still lifes of 
the plants in my backyard, watched TV and filmed 
my own wacky short films on my iMac G5 — all by 
myself. Going out anywhere for an extended period 
of time — particularly a place that was crowded, 
loud and overwhelming like the mall, a busy restau-
rant or a bar mitzvah party — was a major struggle.
Even though I cherished my aloneness, a part of 
me knew deep down that I might also be an extro-
vert, but that I just hadn’t found the right people to 
surround myself with. My lack of interest in sports 
alienated me from my male peers, while my general 
fear of social interaction made it difficult to find 
ways to connect with people my age. Still, there was 
something missing, an experience I was craving but 
that also somehow felt far beyond my reach. 
Once high school approached, I found myself 
becoming friends with people who shared my pas-
sion for pop culture and began making plans to hang 
with them out over the weekends. While I credit my 
summers at Jewish sleepaway camp and the Jewish 
youth group I belonged to for exposing me to a wide 
network of like-minded individuals, high school 
was what provided me the opportunity to meet 
people I wouldn’t normally engage with. I started to 
genuinely like being around people: going to mov-
ies with them, having deep conversations, getting 
dinner, venturing to concerts, having sleepovers. 
The more social circles I immersed myself in, the 
sharper I was at socializing. It was as if a key to that 
part of myself had been unlocked and I had finally 
found what I was looking for. 
And yet, every now and then, my introversion 
pulls me back. Between the end of high school and 
the beginning of college, I began to notice the limi-
tations of my newfound extroversion. Talking with 
someone became stimulating at first, but exhausting 
after a while. I’d click “Going” on Facebook invites 
to upcoming events, but on the day of, I sometimes 
couldn’t exert the effort to follow through with my 
initial plan to go. After sophomore year, I stopped 
going to tailgates because I knew what to expect 

and didn’t feel compelled enough to day drink for 
four hours and dance to the same old sing-a-long 
jams almost every Saturday of the fall semester.
Depending on my mood, I found myself getting 
irritable whenever I was with a group of people 
that would rather go to Rick’s or a house party than 
stay in and watch a rom-com. When I am at a bar 
or a party, and enough conversations have been had 
and enough drinks have been consumed, I’ll stand 
in the corner, space out, check Instagram or look at 
the clock to see when is the most appropriate time 
to leave.
At a school as intensely extroverted as the Uni-
versity of Michigan, the pressure to hang out with 
people on a constant basis is especially draining. 
The social environment of a college like Michigan 
is built on a rather cruelly idealistic expectation 
that in order to truly have fun and embrace the 
undergraduate experience, we must interact with 
our friends as often as possible. We aren’t, however, 
conditioned to just be by ourselves. Aloneness is 
often negatively associated with loneliness. 
For me, being alone is not the same thing as being 
lonely. When I spend a long amount of time solo, my 
body will tell me — even sometimes force me — to 
explore the outside world and catch up with friends 
over dinner or coffee. But when I maximize my 
time with other people, my body will persuade 
me that I’m in desperate need of a me-time 
recharge and soon, I’m sitting in the swivel 
chair in my bedroom, catching up on a Net-
flix show, stuffing my face with whatever 
snacks are left in the pantry.
The weird thing about being an ambi-
vert is that I don’t have a preference for 
my introversion or my extroversion. They 
coexist with one another. It’s a symbiotic, 
“both-and” relationship rather than an 
“either-or” dynamic. It’s not because I 
can’t make up my mind. It’s because I 
don’t want to feel constrained to just 
one thing. Confining myself to a singu-
lar trait or interest makes it harder for 
me to grow. If I just stick with being 
one thing, it would be like a betrayal 
to my inner self — a complete sup-
pression of who I am. Though 
I am totally comfortable 
with my ambiversion, 
I worry a lot about 
balancing these two 
sides of myself. A con-
tradiction is a blessing 
and curse, but as a cyni-
cal optimist, I’d like to 
think it’s more of the 
former.

This series is an ode to the college lifestyle that rarely warrants the time to 

wallow in your own thoughts and write for fun. Every month we pose a prompt 

and receive personal essay submissions from students across the University of 

Michigan. The following four writers explored the January prompt of duality.

Confessions of an ambivert

The February “Night Shift 
Essay” prompt is all about dis-
honesty. We are taught the risks 
of lying from a young age with 
the tale of Pinocchio’s growing 
nose. Yet, it would be naïve to 
think that human beings never 
lie. Sometimes we mess up and 
tell big lies. And sometimes ver-
sions of the truth squeak by as 
white lies. We lie to ourselves, 
our friends, our family and even 
strangers. Be honest about your 
dishonesty in 800 to 1200 words. 
Email your submission to state-

Wednesday, January 30, 2019// The Statement
6B

W

e were walking through the 
Diag when Lauren first told 
me that her mom walked in on 
her losing her virginity. Life went on around 
us in Ann Arbor: Diag noises. Whir of a bike 
tire. The stir of leaves on a tree. The way she 
spoke was almost blasé, with the laugh I’ve 
grown to know well. Initially, I didn’t believe 
her. She’d been my best friend for more than 
a year, and yet this story had somehow never 
come up during our late night conversations 
in sticky Pizza House booths. After going 
back and forth for a while, she’d managed 
to convince me, despite the fact that I was 
initially surprised by her emotionless dec-
laration of virginity (or lack thereof.) As I 
reflected upon her confession, I concluded 
the situation wasn’t the end of the world — 
crippling embarrassment and the awkward 
fumbles that come with a “first time” mag-
nified a thousand times when your mom 
opens the door. I realized that years later, 
she is no longer scarred from the memory, 
she looks back on that day with a lightheart-
ed attitude and a dose of humor.
It’s just sex. Right?
I asked her what happened next — how her 
mom reacted or what she said. The answer 
was nothing; her mom was completely 
silent, until the next morning when her dad 
woke her up and simply said, “We’re going 

to church.” This 
was ironic con-
sidering Lauren 
had never really 
gone to church 
throughout her 
childhood — her 
dad always went 
alone and she 
wasn’t ever reli-
gious. The car 
was quiet while 
they drove to 
the 
church, 
the silence was 
uncomfort-
able and large, 
awkward 
and 
inevitable. She 
sat in the pew, 
next 
to 
her 
father and fig-
ured maybe she 
was 
supposed 
to meditate on 
her sins for a 
while. 
Maybe, 
since her first 
go at pre-mar-
ital sex was so 
awkward, God 
would give her a 
get out of jail free card — just this once.
“What would you have said?!” she 
remarked through laughter.
I thought about losing mine. It wasn’t 
such a catastrophic event like the one she 
just described — but, rather, pretty unre-
markable, in the way losing your virginity 
can be. It’s a milestone built up to be such a 
life changing moment, but often times you 
leave that moment quite the same.
Diag noises. Whir of a bike tire. The stir of 
leaves on a tree.
T

he year is 2015 and I am 17 years 
old. I’m standing in front of a full 
length mirror in my bedroom, gaz-
ing at my reflection. My eyes are green, and 
I narrow them as I look at myself, scrutiniz-
ing every last detail. I never wear makeup, 
so I don’t know why I’d spent time shakily 
brushing mascara against my eyelashes. I 
don’t feel like badass Rizzo in “Grease” 
when she sneaks out of her window to go 
pick up football player Kenickie and drive 
to the infamous lover’s land on the edge of 
town. Instead, I feel a contradictory mix of 
reserve and anxiety –– calm in my choice, 
but anxious in the buildup. I’d never been so 
self-aware before — in a state of wondering 
about myself in the most inward way, scru-
tinizing everything, reflecting on every-
thing. I feel the beat of my heart against my 

rib cage, and feel tranquility in its rhythm. 
I sit down on the edge of my meticulously 
made bed, smoothing out the denim of my 
loose-fitting jeans. The outfit I’d planned 
feeling somehow not right. It’s one of those 
moments when you know you’re about to 
do something that you think is risky and 
mature and provocative, but looking back 
on it now, it was just a first-time life event –– 
losing your virginity. Something that most 
people experience in the course of a life-
time. They say there’s a first time for every-
thing, but when you’re 17, there’s something 
frightening about only getting the chance to 
have one first time. I run my fingers through 
my hair and tug on the hem of my softest 
sweater. Is this the kind of outfit you wear to 
lose your virginity? This all felt like a whis-
pered secret between me and my boyfriend 
and my sweater. After overthinking my out-
fit for far too long, I forfeited any attempts to 
change my appearance or change my mind. 
I was sure of myself. I was sure of my choice.
I went downstairs.
“I’m going to Daniel’s house,” I said to my 
mother.
“Make good choices,” she responded. I 
got my car keys and drove to his house. My 
hands were shaking.
Make good choices.
I thought about her words as I drove. Was 
this a “good choice”? I’d certainly thought 
my decision through plenty; I trusted the 
other person, had dated him for a long while 
before this night, and we both felt ready. But 
did all of that mean it was a good choice?
I couldn’t tell if sex made me nervous, or 
if the stigma surrounding sex made me ner-
vous.
S

ex and religion are tightly bound 
when you are raised Roman Catho-
lic. I was taught at church and in 
Bible study about what I was supposed to 
do and what I wasn’t supposed to do. In fifth 
grade we had to take an abstinence Bible 
study course through our religious educa-
tion. The teachers showed us pictures of 
deformed genitalia in attempts to scar us for 
life, then told the boys not to masturbate as 
everyone giggled under their breath. At the 
end of the course, we had to take a pledge 
of virginity, writing our promise down and 
signing our sloppy, 11-year-old signatures 
on a piece of paper. We then had to drop 
our pledge into what my religious education 
teacher called “the chastity box.” I wrote, 
“I promise I will be a virgin until college 
(maybe)” on the paper, signed it and sweat 
profusely as I put it in the box. I didn’t want 
to promise God something I wasn’t sure I 
could stick to. I didn’t want to go to Hell.
With sex as a staple of American cul-
ture, and an even bigger hallmark of col-

lege hookups, societally, sex isn’t widely 
regarded as an action of sin. If everyone 
had to go to church every time they had 
sex, some people would never leave. When 
I was growing up, the stigmas attached to 
sex shaded the act not as an adult choice, but 
rather a life-shattering sin that could guar-
antee my eternity in Hell. I wondered about 
how many people waited till marriage. I 
respect them for this choice, yet back then, 
couldn’t help but worry that in order to be 
a good Catholic, or a Christian at all, I had 
to abstain, too. In religious education, they 
treated the subject as though I’d go to Hell 
the minute I broke my chastity box promise. 
But six years later, there I was — promise 
broken, in my Jeep Wrangler, driving home 
and not toward Satan’s gates. I came home 
that night and thought about the 11-year-old 
pledge I’d just shattered.
Something about it all made me feel 
guilty, or immoral. Like I’d done a truly bad 
thing. I went upstairs and took a shower, and 
stood there under the hot water for an hour. 
I was not trying to wash off what I’d done, 
but rather attempting to wash away my guilt 
for what had just happened. To wash away 
feeling like I’d sinned, or feeling like I was 
going to Hell, or that God hated me, or that 
I couldn’t be Catholic anymore. I thought 
about how people cherry-pick the Bible. 
There are people who believe that God hates 
gay people, but they aren’t virgins. There 
are people who go to church every Sunday, 
but who also cheat on their spouses. There 
are people who get divorced, but pray to 
God every night. Religion to me suddenly 
seemed overwhelming and impossible to 
navigate. I couldn’t imagine that God or 
Jesus would now hate me because of some-
thing that felt so trivial, especially when I’d 
always tried my best to find a connection to 
my faith. I also thought about Mary Magda-
lene, whom the Catholic church links with 
penance (reconciliation of sins) because she 
was arbitrarily identified as a prostitute, 
despite the fact that she was one of Jesus’ 
largest supporters and witness to his cruci-
fixion, burial and resurrection.
I couldn’t sleep that night. I tossed and 
turned for a few hours, thinking about the 
implications of my decision swirling in my 
mind — wondering if it’d ever find a way 
out. Wondering if I was sorry, deciding that 
I wasn’t. After a while, I didn’t know what 
to do anymore, fighting exhaustion and the 
inability to close my eyes. My legs like lead, 
my head heavy, my body different — but my 
mind the same. I thought about all the plau-
sible solutions for an impossible predica-
ment for so long I could barely think straight 
any longer, so I put my hands together, and 
I prayed.

When thinking about virginity

NIGHT SHIFT

ILLUSTRATION BY CHRISTINE JEGARL


A 

21-year-old man and 
my childhood friend, 
whom we will call 
“X,” had a serious girlfriend for 
two years in college, and was 
very happy with her (evident in 
his Instagram feed with recur-
ring captions: “Grateful for my 
best friend”). But he was actively 
approaching other women and 
professing his feelings for them.
As an outsider, I would con-
demn him as a hypocritical 
womanizer. I always held the 
blunt belief that infidelity is the 
betrayal of trust, and those who 
help the cheater are complicit in 
the immoral act of violating rela-
tionship norms. Thus, getting 
with X was nowhere on my moral 
compass. Being on the other side 
of an infidelity equation was defi-
nitely not a place I ever imagined 
myself, but in a twist of fate — 
one nebulous night in New York 
City over the summer— I became 
the “other” woman.
Amidst aimless bar-hopping, 

when he tried to kiss me, I reject-
ed him because I knew he had 
a long-distance girlfriend. But 
he was insistent, saying, “We 
are still young, we should live a 
little,” and I drunkenly thought, 
“why not?”
Terrible decision.
I observed the dangerous 
effortlessness to indulge in my 
vices just the next night. An 
irresponsible fling subsequently 
bloomed.
Although I felt nauseous from 
being with him, there was a sinis-
ter excitement in the affair. After 
a long week of competing in cor-
porate internships, I itched for 
our fancy dinner dates in SoHo 
and the movie nights followed by 
romantic strolls through Times 
Square. I was living with a cou-
ple and they thought he was my 
long-term boyfriend.
The scenario was great, except 
it was all a lie and I was fully 
aware of it. But in my mind, I 
had already enforced a denial 

of his girlfriend’s 
existence because 
I 
was, 
honestly, 
ashamed.
A part of me 
even 
knew 
our 
fling was built on 
his insecurity. But 
I wanted to be 
flattered. I didn’t 
want anything to 
do with what was 
happening 
under 
the surface. Yet 
I was still, not so 
deep down, dis-
gusted at who I was 
over that summer. 
However, 
admit-
ting to myself that 
I have consciously 
betrayed my val-
ues and in turn 
ignited my inner 
dark cravings for 
the forbidden fruit 
was the inevitable 
self-confrontation 
I wanted to avoid 
in order to “live 
in 
the 
present.” 
In other words, I 
was the conflicted 
“other” woman. 
Soon enough, summer came 
to an end and confessions of his 
love for me arrived with it, which 
contradictorily enshrined the 
guilt-painted reality that he had 
a girlfriend. I was devastated 
that I helped a man cheat on a 
woman who had no idea what her 
boyfriend was doing behind her 
back. So I denounced the affair 
and we agreed to distance our-
selves when we returned to our 
respective colleges, and he went 
back to living with her. Yet, noth-
ing stopped.
We regularly fired text mes-
sages, where he couldn’t stop 
reminiscing on our summer dal-
liances and I couldn’t contain my 
guilt. He implied we should orga-
nize some New York City esca-
pades because “a guy who works 
out and has a lot of testosterone 
needs to have sex.” Two months 
earlier, I would 
deliberately dis-
regard such alarming statements. 
But now, I was the conscience-
stricken “other” woman, so him 

excusing his infidelity with the 
precursor of masculinity was a 
red flag for me.
I made some new discoveries. 
While he was seeing me and still 
in a relationship with his girl-
friend, he was also pouring out 
romantic messages to another 
childhood friend’s college room-
mate — a girl he had never met, 
but admired through stalking 
her Instagram. He was simulta-
neously telling his high school 
girlfriend that she was “the one” 
ever since they broke up four 
years ago. She was shattered 
when X misled her to believe that 
he wanted to rekindle their rela-
tionship but later refused to leave 
his current girlfriend.
With the growing tide of 
morality burning within myself, 
I started confronting my per-
verseness for feeding his falla-
cious ideas that he could just 
play with four different women’s 
emotions and presume there 
would be no repercussions. So I 
pressed his need to be truthful to 
his girlfriend for his own good. 
My role now changed to “the 
good friend.” 
In the following turbulent 
days, a mutual friend of ours, 
whom 
X 
would 
habitually 
approach for relationship advice, 
discovered his cheating and also 
urged him to tell his girlfriend. 
This is when X called me cry-
ing and said: “I have told her 
everything, she is sitting right 
in front of me.” I knew him well 
enough to know he was falsifying 
a mental breakdown just to stop 
conversations that made him 
uncomfortable. But I didn’t dis-
close that I didn’t believe him. I 
was exhausted.
A few sleepless nights later, 
our friend showed me new posts 
of X and his girlfriend together 
that confirmed he faked the 
whole event of telling his girl-
friend. Now, I felt the necessity 
of slamming the brakes hard on 
X. I was too guilty for fueling his 
twisted romantic perspective. I 
knew he would keep going if no 
one stopped him and I knew his 
girlfriend would be the one to 
suffer the most.
After a month of pondering 

about her well-being, I sent an 
email to her with screenshots of 
texts between me and X. I owned 
up to my complicity in getting 
with 
her 
boyfriend, 
despite 
knowing she existed.
Within an hour, X tried call-
ing me and I firmly refused to 
talk to him, because him desir-
ing my reasoning for sending 
the email only demonstrated his 
ongoing belief that his “obedient 
girlfriend” (in his own words) 
was not entitled to learn of his 
mendacity. But parts of me were 
crumbling — I felt awful for doing 
this to my friend, even though I 
believed I did the right thing by 
coming clean to his girlfriend. 
With contradictions flaming in 
my mind, I ultimately texted him 
to close the chapter.
Although without animosity, 
he expressed his devastation for 
hearing his girlfriend say, “You 
are dead to me,” and requested 
for me to forward the email so 
he could explain his “thought 
process” for every event. Of 
course, I was not going to help 
him sow more excuses. Instead, I 
implored him to face the situation 
with veracity, as I was now the 
“good moral being” in addition 
to my previous role of the “good 
friend.” He finally expressed an 
interest in understanding the 
root of why he kept on doing all 
this. After that, we blocked each 
other from everything (includ-
ing Venmo and LinkedIn). I 
never received a reply from his 
girlfriend, but I only hope I’ve 
helped her future in some way. 
Sometimes I wish this story 
never happened. I distressed my 
friend and possibly ended his 
relationship. Yet, I remain con-
tent with the thought that per-
haps we all learned to never drive 
down the roads of infidelity, 
deceit and lies again. And as days 
pass, I’m tempted to shelf this 
experience as a faint, vile mem-
ory. But I precariously attempt to 
hold on to the trajectory of will-
fully abandoning my moral codes 
and rediscovering them. After 
my stressful ride to the “other” 
side, I commit to exercising self-
control next time my impulses 
try to hijack my beliefs.
