FILM REVIEW
lgKin gdom'.9 keeps youth too clean

Anderson's film can't-

By JENNIFER XU
Magazine Editor
In Sylvia Plath's poem "The Bab-
ysitters," two nubile girls escape
from the white-pillared mansion
of their employ-
ers and take off **
in a green boat.

reality ofgrowingup.
If the babysitter was Wes Ander-
son and the oceanic voyage his
quest to reclaim childhood, then
"Moonrise Kingdom" is his eva-
nescent dollhouse. Set in a sum-
#Wer camp chivalrously christened
Camp Ivanhoe, the film spends 90
percent of its time on two young
"troubled" lovers who parade their
goldenrod love through storm,
sea and calamity. Part children's
adventure story, part New Wave
rendezvous, "Moonrise" is ear-
nestly filtered through the lens
of a burgeoning adolescent, high-
lighting the troubles of preserv-
ing innocence while hurtling into
adulthood.
o utwardly, "Moonrise King-

dom" is a vision. The film's aesthet-
ic is Anderson's most successful to
date. The miniature tent spaces, lit
with the sepia tone of a crinkled
Polaroid photograph, marked with
every square centimeter the ache of
loneliness. The people are decorat-
edjust as pristinely - plaid on plaid,
every hair pleated, every wrinkle
smoothed.
But where "Moonrise" fal-
ters is in its execution: The dolls
in the dollhouse just won't do
what they're supposed to. Ander-
son's miniature worlds, so tidily
arranged, are in effect ruined by
the young actors who reside in
them. Scenes designed to induce
prolonged feelings of melancholy
instead feel laughable and inau-
thentic.
Why is this? After all, it's not
like it hasn't been done before.
We've come to recognize - even
love - the prototypical "Wes
Anderson" character: earnest,
filled with wanderlust, possessing
a vaguely childlike/foreign nick-
name. Margot. Dignan. Steve Zis-
sou. We'd think that "Moonrise"'s
newly minted protagonists - real
children who act as adults (rath-
er than the other way around)
- would ably round out the hal-
lowed cast.
But the issue when working
with child actors, particularly
ones with little experience in the
cinematic realm, is that it's 'dif-
ficult to attain Anderson's brand
of droll tonality without sounding
too affected.

FOCUS

Listen, I'm not going to lie, I have no idea where we are.

Suzy, particularly struggles with
this task. often her lines - already
slightly asinine ("I want to go on
adventures, I think. Not get stuck in
one place.") - run flat, and her into-
nations blur over. Mouth shut, the
12-year-old Hayward is a splendor,
imbued with the kind of '60s after-
glow British mod revivalists would
have gone gaga over. But mouth
open, she's kind of a dud.
Auteur theory dictates that a film
be executed just so, and Anderson
falls on the pickier end of that spec-

trum. In arranging the objects, yes,
he wholly succeeds. But can living
beings - particularly children - be
directed that way? What's more,
should they? After all, adolescence
is a messy thing. Perhaps a film
about adolescence ought to embrace
that messiness.
That's not to say that Anderson's
films don't contain some internal
devastation. They do. But while
the destruction of Anderson's uni-
verse is the calculated disaster - the
cracking of the mirror into equal,

jagged fragments - the graduation
from childhood isn't quite so math-
ematical. Human beings have never
been that mathematical.
More and more, it feels like
Anderson would prefer to work
with animatronics, porcelain faces
as pure and shiny as if they were
incubated in eggshells. That's per-
haps why "Fantastic Mr. Fox" ranks
so highly in the critical discourse.
There were no people to get in the,
way of Anderson's vigilantly curat-
ed display cases.

In-state students
with 4.9-percent
increase, out-of-
state 6.7-percent
By BETHANY BIRON
ManagingNews Editor
The University's Board of
Regents voted 5-3 last Thursday
to increase tuition rates by 2.8
percent for in-state students and
3.5 percent for out-of-state stu-
dents for the 2012-2013 academic
year.
The rates will amount to a hike
of $360 for in-state students and
$1,340 for out-of-state students
and will be paired with a 10.1-per-
cent increase in available financial
aid for need-based undergraduate
students, totaling $144.8 million.
During the meeting, University
President Mary Suew Coleman
said the increase in financial aid
will help offset the tuition hike
for students in need.
"For four straight years now,
we have presented a financial
aid budget that covers the full
increase in tuition for our needi-
est students," Coleman said. "This
year's increase in financial aid

As anyone who's been in a news-
room can tell you, breaking news is

like a drug - things just move faster
when you're working against the
clock and the competition to get the
news out. Sorkin effectively cap-
tures that emotion as Maggie scores
her first big interview, getting a gov-
ernment official to comment on the
worsening environmental disaster.
Like "The West Wing", which

romanticized government ser-

a more-perfect form of modern
journalism. There were flashes of
Sorkin's brilliance throughout the

newsroom can actually deliver on
that promise by showing that it's
more than just talk.

Snyder signs bill for campuses across Mich.

Bill allocates
construction funds,
'U' to get $30
million
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
ManagingEditor
Yesterday, Republican Gov.
Rick Snyder signed the Capital
Outlay Bill, giving about $304
million to universities and com-
munity colleges across the state
for construction and infrastruc-
ture projects.
The University will receive
$30 million from the state, which,
along with $17 million from the
University's funds, will go toward
renovating the G. G. Brown Labo-
ratory Building on North Campus.
In addition to this project for
the.Ann Arbor campus, the Uni-
versity of Michigan-Dearborn
will receive $30 million and the

about $273.1 million, increasing
1.6 percent from last year, and is
part of Republican Gov. Rick Sny-
der's projected budget that calls
for a 3.1-percent increase in high-
er education funding. This follows
the fiscal year 2012 budget, in
which the state's 15 public univer-
sities saw a 15-percent decrease in
funding.
During the press conference,
Hanlon said while the University
appreciates its relationship with
the state, the administration will
continue to urge the government
to expand its efforts to aid state
universities that have suffered
repeated cuts over the course-of
the last decade.
"We value our long partnership
with the state, and we appreciate
very much that the state is increas-
ing its investment in higher educa-
tion," Hanlon said. "In real terms,
the state appropriations for the
Ann Arbor campus has dropped
$178 million over the past 11 years,
and so we urge the state to con-
tinue to make higher education a
priority."
Regents Denise hitch (D-Bing-
ham Farms), Laurence Dietch
(D-Bingham Farms) and Andrea
Fischer Newman (R-Ann Arbor)

University of Michigan-Flint will
receive $16.6 million for their
respective construction projects.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said these projects
have been discussed for several
years, but have become tangible
with the funding from the bill.
"These are all projects that
had been previously approved
for planning, and it's just really
great to have the funding come
through," Fitzgerald said.
He added that the capital out-
lay for universities in the state
occurs annually and that the Uni-
versity has been pining for these
particular renovations.
"The University of Michigan
has taken a conservative approach
of not having a long list - a wish
list - of projects for state fund-
ing," Fitzgerald said.
Instead, he said the University
has been focusing on "a particu-
lar project or projects that would
be most helpful to have the state
involved."
voted against the tuition increas-
es, expressing frustration with the
growing rates and providing sug-
gestions for other methods of cut-
ting costs.
"I think we need a new model,
and I think there are ways to do
it," Newman said in an interview
after the meeting. "I think there
are ways to raise revenue."
During the meeting, Ilitch
called the trend of increasing
tuition at the University and
around the nation "unacceptable,"
noting that upwards of 60 percent
of the state's college graduates
carry substantial debt.
"There's one thing that remains
consistent, and that is that tuition
continues to skyrocket and the
burden on our students continues
to increase," Ilitch said.
Regent Julia Darlow (D-Ann
Arbor) echoed Ilitch's sentiment"
about the strains of rising tuition
costs for families, though she
added she was "very pleased
and very impressed" with the
administration's effort to assist
students through increased
financial aid.
Darlow said vast improvements
have been made to aid students'
from middle- and low-income
homes, and the. average middle-
income student now pays less than
they did in 2004.
In setting the University's bud-

In total, the state of Michigan
and 18 universities and communi-
ty colleges across the state will be
spending $613 million on renova-
tions and construction for higher
education with the bill.
State Rep. Eileen. Kowall (R-
White Lake), the bill's sponsor,
said the bill makes sense for both
the short- and long-term future of
the state.
"It's important because, for
one thing, it's immediate jobs in
the construction industry, and it's
also jobs for the future," Kowall
said. "We want to have a world
class talent pool in Michigan and
you have to have facilities ... you
have to have the infrastructure
there."
Kowall acknowledged that
without state funding, the schools'
plans wouldn't be possible.
"The fact of the matter. is that
with these projects the universi-
ties and community colleges do as
much private fundraising as they
can, but they can't do it all them-
get, Hanlon noted three primary
goals: maintaining and expand-
ing the University's academic
strength and excellence, operating
efficiently and ensuring college
affordability and accessibility.
As part of the budget, faculty
will receive a 3-percent salary
increase, and staff will receive
a 2-percent salary increase as
part of the budget, which Hanlon
said is essential to securing the
strength of the University.
"Academic excellence begins
with human resources. Universi-
ties are excellent because of their
people," Hanlon said. "To main-
tain academic excellence, we need
the most outstanding students,
faculty and staff at this univer-
sity."
According to Hanlon, por-
tions of the general funds will
also be allocated to maintaining
the University's library system,
developing educational program
and investing in new technology.
Funds will also be used to better
consolidate IT programs on cam-
pus that he said have historically
been "disaggregated" with too
many units.
To decrease budget cuts and
tuition increases, the University
has continued to engage in
a long-term commitment to
cost containment policies,
spearheaded by Coleman in

selves," Kowall said. "By the state
helping to fund these projects,
it also helps to keep the cost of
tuition down."
LSA senior Rachel Jankowski,
the president of the University's
chapter of College Republicans,
said she is pleased with the pass-
ing of the bill.
She said that most people,
regardless of party affiliation, are
pro-education.
"People tend to think (that
Republicans) don't want spending
on education, but what we want
is a choice for people to be able
to pick whatever school it is they
want to go to," Jankowski said.
"And we want students to be able
go to good schools."
She added that, as a student,
she can see the effects of funding
education.
"I'm always happy when educa-
tion gets more money," Jankows-
ki said. "Especially (because I'm)
going to one of the schools getting
$30 million (from the bill)."
2004. Since the onset of the
program, the University has
reduced $235 million in general
fund expenditures and seeks to
save another $120 million in the
next five years - $30 million
specifically in the coming fiscal
year.
Cost containment efforts
include reducing low-enrollment
classes, better consolidation of
services and staff, altering health
care and benefit programs and
increasing energy efficiency in
campus buildings.
The cost reduction program has
allowed for reallocation of funds
to other efforts like revitalizing
academic buildings. Hanlon said
the University will soon embark
on a three-year program that will
grant $45 million each year for
large-scale campus renovations,
which are "more cost-effective
than doing piecemeal fix ups."
The administration seeks to
ensure that the quality of life on
campus is not hindered or nega-
tively impacted for students when
determining the budget and cut-
ting costs, according to Hanlon.
"We do not want to in anyway
reduce the experience our stu-
dents have, so we're very careful
when we do these things to try to
make sure we do them in a way
that will enable an excellent edu-
cation for our students," he said.

SRIES PREMIERE
'Newsroom' all preach, no action-

Aaron Sorkin's
journalism fantasy
can't find meaning
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Editor in Chief
Cable news isbroken, Aaron Sor-
kin argues in his new HBO series
"The News-
room."
And, frankly,
it's hard to dis- The News-
agree with him as
partisan bicker- OOMf
ing and 30-sec- S
ond sound bites Sundaysat
of talking heads 10 p.m'
now" dominate HBO
the cable land-
scape. But the
alternative Sorkin offers in "The
Newsroom" isn't necessarily a
solution to the problems plaguing
broadcast journalism.

The group of journalists penned
by Sorkin, the creator of "The West
Wing" and writer of "The Social
Network," are a high-minded, self-
righteous bunch who spend more
time talking about the news than
reporting it.
"There's nothing that's more
important in a democracy than a
well informed electorate," claims
MacKenzie McHale (Emily Mori-
tmer, "Hugo"), the newly-hired
executive producer of Sorkin's
idealized news broadcast "News
Night."
"When there's no information,
or much worse, wrong information,
it can lead to calamitous decisions
and clobber any attempt at vigor-
ous debate," she continues nause-
atingly. "That's why I produce the
news."
While her goal is just (who
doesn't want an informed elector-
ate?), Sorkin's characters bludgeon
the point to death. Over and over
again, throughout the pilot, various

staffers rip off soliloquies as they
work to resurrect their meddling
program.
Sorkin clearly yearns for the eras
of Edward R. Murrow and Wal-
ter Cronkite, when larger-than-
life figures ruled the airwaves
and authoritatively told Ameri-
cans about the state of the world.
Anchorman Will McAvoy, (Jeff
Daniels, "Dumb and Dumber"), a
self-described "affable" guy who
has made it to the top of the TV
news food chain without causing
much trouble, has been put in place
to assume that mantle.-
McAvoy may very well be that
man, but the vehicle created by
Sorkin may not be able to deliver
him there.
Summaries of upcoming epi-
sodes on the network's website
make it seem like "The Newsroom"
is headed down a perilously
preachy path with McAvoy and his
staff talking about why the news
is important instead of showing,

through hard-nosed reporting,
why it's important.
The show opens as McAvoy,
speaking on a panel at North-
western University, is asked why
America is the greatest country in
the world. "It's not," he responds,
unleashing a tirade toward the
unassuming sophomore who asked
the question.
In a perfectly Sorkinesque rant,
McAvoy ticks off reason after rea-
son why the United States is falling
behind other countries, as audience
members pull out their camera
phones. Before long the video has
gone viral on YouTube.
After most of McAvoy's staff
quits in the fallout from his out-
burst, Charlie Skinner (Sam Wat-
terson, "Law and Order"), the
no-nonsense alcoholic president
of the news division, then hires
McHale, who's returning from
a stint as a producer in Iraq and
Afghanistan, to take over the show
and turn it into an old-fashioned

news program that cares more
about exposing bad guys than win-
ning in the rankings.
Despite his personable public ,
persona, McAvoy is a selfish and
arrogant prick to his staff and
those close to him, yet Daniels'
performance makes the character
almost likable as he slowly realizes
that he wants to be more than just a
famous face on TV.
McAvoy and McHale have a
romantic past, and he's not pleased
with the prospect of working with
her despite her sterling creden-
tials. For someone who gives off
the impression of a fiercely inde-
pendent woman - she has a sca-
on her stomach from a knife wound
sustained while covering a rally in
Pakistan - Mackenzie's strangely
reliant on Will, accepting his near
constant belittlement. It's almost
as if she feels that she hasa respon-
sibility to help him.
Similarly, the budding love tri-

'Vampire Hunter'
takes on history with a
supernatural twist
By ANNA SADOVSKAYA
ManagingArts Editor
Abraham Lincoln, the esteemed
16th president of the United States,
is a vampire hunter. Wielding his
silver axe and
pocket watch
in the name of*
vampire-slain Abraham
ictims, Lincoln Ln :
fights the nefari- ncoh
ous undead, man- Vampire
aging to abolish Hunter
slavery in the H e
process. At Qualityl6
Though his- and Rave
tory classes have
managed to skip Fox
over this intense-
ly badass background story, Timur
Bekmambetov and Tim Burton's
film "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire
Hunter" highlights and exposes the
dark underbelly of 19th-Century
America.
Based on Seth Grahame-Smith's
novel of the same name, "Vampire
Hunter" follows Abe (Benjamin
Walker, "Kinsey") from childhood
to death and all the greatness in

Four score and millions of vampires ago ..
between. After witnessing the
death of his mother by vampire bite,
Lincoln vows to avenge her by going
after as manyvampires as ittakes.
Highly stylized and calculating,
the movie succeeds in creating a
realistic, visually gratifying world.
What if Lincoln really had been a
vampire hunter? What if slavery
was the result of blood-hungry
vampires and their need to feed?
Director Bekmambetov answers
the questions in impressive fashion,
allowing the film to bypass "campy"
on its search for a fantastical ver-
sion of reality.
In typical Burton fashion, the
film also takes a step into the ter-
rifying unknown. When Henry

Sturgess (Dominic Cooper, "My
Week with Marilyn") first offers
his vampire-hunting expertise to
Lincoln, a sense of foreboding fol-
lows the exchange; the feeling of
stepping into unfamiliar terri-
tory. Despite the entirety of the
plot being steeped in fang-fiction,
moments still feel genuine and sur-
prising, once again emphasizingthe
believability of the created world.
Where "Abraham Lincoln: Vam-
pire Hunter" stumbles is in it's
delivery. Relying on its vampire
curb-appeal, the movie decides
to shy away from hilarity, instead
deciding to focus on the action and
seriousness of a would-be vampire
outbreak.
The film wants to be a more-awe-
some version of reality, employing
the tried-and-true recipe ofadding
a twist to established storylines.
And though actors wear their grim
and war-torn faces well, they don't
mask the inevitable predictability
of the film: Whether it's for the
benefit of people or for the eradi-
cation of the head-vampires Adam
(Rufus Sewell, "The Illusionist")
and Vadoma (supermodel Erin
Wasson), Lincoln runs for presi-
dent. Whether abolishing slavery
for equal rights or the freedom of
humanity from vampires, Lincoln
still fights against the tyranny of
the south.
Vampires are not enough of an
incentive to produce a movie, and
despite the visually enticing scen-
ery and cinematography, "Abra-
ham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"
can't keep the high-energy pace.
Vampires don't necessarily mean
instant excitement, and avampire-
hunting Abraham Lincoln is only
moderately more impassioned
then the classic top-hate Abe.

Conn., bandmates Ali Noor, Ali
Hamza and Louis J. Pinto (oth-
erwise known as Gumby) took
turns in a conference call to
describe their U.S. experience to
The Michigan Daily.
"It's been great. It's been one
of the best experiences we've had
so far in our careers," said singer
and guitarist, Ali Noor.
"Back home we're one of the
main acts over there, so obviously
playing gigs you start to get very
comfortable," said percussionist
Gumby. "And here we are, just per-
forming where no one knows you,
especially American audiences,
and we have to play like any other
band that's just startingout. That's
a very different feeling that we
haven't experienced in a while. So
it's a great learning (experience)."
The three original band mem-
bers (six play on the tour) were .
influenced by a range of music
styles from East to West. When
they began working together
over 10 years ago, they blended
their interests into a multicul-
tural style.
"There's a little bit of punk
rock, there's a bit of Indian rock,
there's a lot of Eastern folk melo-
dies," Gumby said. "We all grew
up listening to diverse music ... and
when the three of us are togeth-
er in the studio writing stuff or
recording stuff, you'll see different
things happen in the music."
While the trio has developed
it's own flavor of music, Ali Hamza
(vocals and bass) explained that
he and his brother Noor are truly
songwriters. They strayed from
the usual Pakistani genre of love
songs, decidingto project stronger

messages.
"Our songs have revolved
around the youth," Hamza said.
"There was very little-about what
journey a single individual goes
through, and what an individual
goes through within context of
society. This became our focus."
Noor is a trained lawyer and
Hamza graduated from Lahore
University of Management Sci-
ences with a degree in Econom-
ics. Yet their passion was music,
and they embraced this to form
their energetic and successful
band. Today they continue to
urge others to take risks and fol-
low their dreams.
Emphasizing
creativity noori
comes to Top.
"The youth over there, every-
body has a lot of creative passion,
but most of them tend to for-
get that -along the way," Hamza
explained. "They start doing
engineering and law, and they
obviously want to get into their
professional career. They don't
get much time to carry on with
their hobby or their passion."
Perhaps Pakistani youth are
not the only ones to learn from
the band's message. Many Amer-
ican students today are pres-
sured to seek an "appropriate"
career rather than to follow their
dreams.
With words at the heart of
their music, Noor and Hamza
were thrilled for the opportunity
to write lyrics in English for this
United States tour.
The group felt that American
audiences would not get the full
impact of their words if they only
sang in Urdu, the Pakistani lan-
guage. The band wishes to really
communicate with and connect to
their audiences.
"We wanted ourselves to be
kind of an example, that if you're
passionate about something, you
should definitely go on out and do
it - it might be very difficult for
you, but you definitely should not
stop," Hamza said. "And that's
the message that we communi-
cated to the youth in our coun-
try."

ous technology found difficult to
provide because of the difficulty of
studying inside oceanic storms.
The team of professors beat
out 18 other teams that submit-
ted proposals when the agency
offered an opportunity for funds
for small spaceflight investiga-
tions in Earth's system, made pos-
sible by the Earth Venture-class
series of projects in NASA's Earth
Science Division.
The University professors will
partner with Southwest Research
Institute of Texas, Surrey Satel-
lite Technology of Colorado and
the NASA Ames Research Center
to build the satellites and gather
data that can be used for research.
In Earth's orbit, the satellites'
functions will include probing the
interaction between seawater and
air and how that interaction has
a role in the development of hur-
ricanes and other tropical storms.
Ruf, the project's principal
investigator, said the satellites
will be up in space to monitor hur-
ricanes for at least two hurricane
seasons but noted that while the
satellites are designed for a two-
year lifetime, they may last longer.
"The first one is like a training
session, to make sure everything
is working and tune up all of the
electronics properly, and then the
second year we'll be able to really
do it," Ruf said.
Ruf said their mission was
attractive to NASA because their
satellites are smaller and less
expensive than previous satellites.
"There's several different ways
of looking at the surface condi-
tions that have been flying since
the 1970s, and the more tradition-
al ways are much bigger and much
more expensive," he said.
Ruf added that the satellites'
technology will allow for a mis-
sion that will be the first of its
kind.
"As far as using this kind of
technology specifically, it's been
demonstrated twice before on
satellites, but they were just these
little demonstrations, things that
only lasted for a few weeks to
show that the idea was sound,"
Ruf said. "But there was never like
a full, concerted mission to do sus-
tained science."
Ruf said the team also exten-
sively researched cyclones before
submitting the proposal.
"We did a lot of historical anal-
ysis ... as part of the design study
for how many satellites we would
need and the detail about their

design so we would be able to see
a lot of hurricanes," Ruf said.
The mission will focus on tak-
ing measurements of hurricanes
during the hurricanes, which
hasn't been done before, accord-
ing to Ruf.
"(Old satellites) stopped work-
ing well as soon as you get close
to the middle of the hurricane
because there is too much rain,
and this new technique can see
right through the rain well, so
that's a big-deal thing," Ruf said.
Ruf added that studying such
hard-to-reach areas of the storms
can help meteorologists better
forecast the intensity of hurri-
canes in the future.
Posselt said he joined the proj-
ect to further investigate convec-
tion as a general topic, rather than
solely tropical cyclones.
"My task on this is ... to explore
uses of this data to try to under-
stand tropical precipitation," Pos-
selt said.
Posselt added that smaller
storms are important to study as
well.
"In the last five or 10 years or
so, there's been a more concerted
effort to try to understand these
tropical systems, partly because
they can give rise to hurricanes
down the road if they persist long
enough and organize in the right
way," Posselt said.
Posselt added that NASA saw
how their proposal would ben-
efit science without an exorbitant
cost.
"So for NASA, I think this prob-
ably fell in a bit of a sweet spot ...
it's a measurement that we don't
have globally but it's using tech-
nology that we don't have to spend
tens of millions of dollars develop-
ing," Posselt said.
NASA spokesman Steve Cole
said this mission will provide
NASA with the kind of cutting-
edge study of Earth they look for.
"NASA does a lot of research
into developing for new ways to
use the vantage point of space,
having instruments in space to
study weather, hurricanes, all
sorts of earth science," Cole said.
"We've had a number of missions
that study winds ... and this mis-
sion is kind of pushing the enve-
lope."
Cole added that it is somewhat
unique for NASA to have a univer-
sity-led mission.
"Most NASA missions are done
not at universities, but we do
have a history in a wide range of
sciences of what we call P.I.-led
missions. We have them in planet
science and solar science," Cole
said.

Students directed to
Hatcher restrooms
during summer
renovations
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily News Editor
Students studying at the Sha-
piro Undergraduate Library this
term may be inconvenienced by a
lack of functional lavatories.
As a part of a project that began
June 14, all of the bathrooms in
the UGLi are closed for renova-
tions.
Rebecca Dunkle, associate
university librarian for library
operations, said in a statement
Thursday the entirety of the
library's plumbing chase - the
area where water and sew-
age pipes are based - is being
replaced, leaving all of the build-
ing's sinks and toilets inoperable.
As part of the renovation, the
plumbing fixtures in the bath-
rooms will also be replaced.
Rather than closing down and
repairing the restrooms one at a
time, Dunkle said the bathrooms
all had to be closed down because
"trying to re-direct waste and
water from floor to floor is almost
impossible."
For those who need to use a
bathroom, library officials are
directing students and other
guests to the 22 restrooms in the
Hatcher Graduate Library next
door.
Dunkle s'aid the library doesn't

expect students' studying to be
hindered by the renovations,
which are projected to last the
duration of the summer.
"Since the summer is relatively
slow and there are restrooms so
conveniently close, this was the
deemed to be the best option,"
Dunkle said.
When asked whether closing
the library would conflict with
workplace requirements, offi-
cials from the Occupational Safe-
ty and Health Administration at

both the state and federal levels
said as long as the University has
an alternate location for library
employees, the multi-restroom
closing does not violate any labor
laws.
Business sophomore Kevin
Hashman said the renovations
seem unnecessary.
"I didn't think they need reno-
vations - they were OK," Hash-
man said. "They needed more
frequent cleanings, in my opin-
ion, more than renovations."

No more deportation
President Obama's mandate helps undocumented students
The U.S. was founded with the firm conviction that it would be an
accepting place for people everywhere. This idea has been thor-
oughly tested throughout our country's history. President Barack
Obama, who has done little to help illegal immigrants and U.S. residents
gain citizenship, announced that the federal government can't initi-
ate the deportation of illegal immigrants in some cases. Obama's immi-
gration mandate is a step in the right direction toward granting young,
undocumented immigrants living in the United States residency status
and, eventually, citizenship.

A bright smile, a nod hello or
even a simple look of recognition in
someone's eyes can make any place
feel like home.
Weeks into
abroad experi-
ence, I've come
to accept Rome
as another
place I call
home - if only
for six weeks. CAITLIN
I have the
unique experi- MORATH
ence of living
in one hotel
for the duration of my trip. This
has fostered a warm relationship
with the people who work at the
reception desk, along with many
angry hotel guests. I'm guessing
the hotel doesn't advertize that
patrons are paying 135 euros a
night to sleep in the equivalent of
a Markley dorm room.
But honestly, complaining
neighbors remind me of home too.
All of these aspects combine to
make the hotel feel like a place we
can call our own: It's our noise, our
mess and our terrace (much to the
chagrin of the other guests). Plus,
the staff is made up of our friends.
OK, so "friends" may be push-
ing it. Sometimes I'm not sure
if the staff really likes us or just
doesn't know how toshandle our
outgoing - and sometimes out-
rageous - group. Their patience
is often tested by our late night
exits, early-morning returns and
spirited conversations that take
place on the terrace. But I'd like
to believe deep down, they really
enjoy us. Love or hate, we've come
to a relationship reminiscent of
siblings. We tease, we bicker and
then we gather in the common
room to watch World Cup soccer.
It's not just the hotel that's
begun to feel like home - it's also
the neighborhood we live in. We
have class from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.
with a coffee break at 10. So of
course, being the sleep deprived,
coffee addicted student I am, I
run around the corner and get a
cappuccino every day. I swear the
shop owner has begun to recog-
nize me (though a mob of 20-some-
things wearing gym shorts and
t-shirts isn't very hard to pick out
of thetcrowd). Whatever the case,
I like to pretend this cute old man
in his brightly colored jacket and
vests recognizes me specifically,
and I practice all the Italian I've
learned on him. Thus far, I'm up

to "heljo, I'd like a croissant and
cappuccino, thank you, goodbye,"
which I think is pretty good for
only having a few hours of Italian
under my belt.
Luckily, I've found some local
haunts that feature English-speak-
ing workers - namely the local
Irish pub. (Yes, I accept the shame
that comes with having your most
frequently visited restaurant in
Rome turn out to be Irish). Nev-
ertheless, the place has good food,
free Internet and interesting serv-
ers, so it maintains its position
at the top of my study spots list.
It's the peoplemthat make me feel
so welcome and comfortable -
though the Ranch dressing doesn't
hurt things.
Any place can
become home
with some effort
Again, "welcome" might have
been an overstatement. The
last time I walked in for Sunday
brunch, I was greeted by my favor-
ite waiter with a hardy "No! Get
the Hell out, I'm too hung-over
for this." Needless to say, ser-
vice in Rome has proven not to
be as chipper or accommodating
as the service I'm used to back in
America. But the service I receive
here, occasionally abrasive, often
friendly, seems more genuine than
the forced hospitality in U.S. estab-
lishments. I may never have a wait-
er tell me to "get out" when I walk
into a restaurant back in Michigan,
but it's equally unlikely he'll stay
an hour and a half after his shift
just to hang out and offer advice
about living in the city.
These past few weeks have prov-
en to me that any place can take on
the comforting aspects of home,
so long as you're willing to make
an effort to get to know the people
who inhabit it. Rome sees thou-
sands of visitors come and go every
day, but there are only a lucky few
who can claim it as home. With the
help of my ever-growing circle of
locals who I can callafriends, I'm
looking to declare it as one of my
homes as well.

football
playoffs
By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor
After much contempt with the
Bowl Championship Series system
- where two teams are selected
by a combination of polling and a
computer system to play for the
national championship game -
the BCS will be no more.
As many expected, on Tuesday,
a committee of NCAA presidents
formally approved a four-team
college football playoff system
that will begin in 2014.
A selection committee will
choose the four teams in a sys-
tem similar to the way the NCAA
basketball field is chosen. In addi-
tion, the semi-final games will be
played at current bowl sites and
the' national championship game
will be awarded to the highest
bidder.
This system has been approved
through the 2025 season.
"A four-team playoff doesn't
go too far; it goes just the right
amount," said Virginia Tech presi-
dent Charles Sterger in the ESPN.
com report, chair of the presiden-
tial oversight committee. "We are
very pleased with this arrange-
ment even though some issues &
remain to be finalized."
The presidents on the commit-
tee are also supporting a rotation
of the semifinal games among
six different bowl sites and the
national championship game
rotating among neutral sites.
The selection committee, per
the report on ESPN.com, will
rank the four teams in the play-
off, "giving all the teams an equal
opportunity to participate," rank-
ing them on their record, strength
of schedule, and whether or not
a team is a conference champion
- putting new significance on
the infant Big Ten Championship
game.
There are still many finalites
that need to be worked out, like
how to divide revenue and who
will be on the selection commit-
tee.

Mike Komisarek will return to Ann Arbor to play in the 2013 Winter Classic.

On June 15, Obama announced
an executive order that forbids
the federal government from
initiating the deportation of ille-
gal immigrants who have lived
in the country for at least five
years; are under the age of 30 and
came to the U.S. before the age
of 16 with their parents; have-no
criminal records; and are high
school graduates, in school or are
military veterans. The New York
Times also reports that, "For
immigrants who come forward
and qualify, Homeland Security
authorities will use prosecuto-
rial discretion to grant deferred
action, a reprieve that will be
valid for two years and will have
to be renewed." This federal man-
date falls short of the DREAM
Act, which would provide a path
to citizenship for the approxi-
mately 65,000 undocumented
college students in the U.S., as
well as many others.
These students invest in Amer
ican universities, often paying

out-of-state tuition, even when
they have lived in-state for their
entire lives. Here at the Univer-
sity of Michigan, students who
have grown up in Michigan are
forced to pay out-of-state tuition,
which is substantially more
expensive. These students should
expect the federal government to
invest in them by providing the
opportunity for them to work in
the U.S. Many of these students,
however, have been forced to
return to their respective coun-
tries without the opportunity to
apply their education to the U.S.
workforce. The new mandate
from the Obama administration
helps to reverse this trend.
But the President's execu-
tive order doesn't go far enough.
While 1.4 million immigrants liv-
ing in the U.S. could benefit from
the new mandate, they have to
apply again for U.S. residency in
only two years. The DREAM Act
would give these same residents
the chance to obtain U.S. citizen-

ship. With the November election
quickly approaching, Obama is
most likely making an appeal to
minority voters without making
any drastic policy change. It's an
unfortunate reality during an elec-
tion year, but he still should have
gone further with this mandate.
All students who have attend-
ed universities here in the U.S.
deserve the chance to apply their
education to a career here, regard-
less of whether they are citizens
or are undocumented. Obama's
mandate will make it possible
for certain undocumented stu-
dents to avoid deportation, and
this is extremely beneficial for
many people. We should remem-
ber, however, that America is the
country it is today because of
immigrants. Without them, many
of us wouldn't be here today. And
with that mindset, we should
make it a priority to grant undoc-
umented students the chance to
become citizens in our histori-
cally accepting country.

Down the hall in his office, sit-

said he remembered coaching

The Wolverines' legendary

"Mike Brown was a real hard-

Berenson said. "He left after his

"It's pretty cold (there). I'm

Winnipeg seemed a likely target
for Trouba entering the draft, and
he noted that the club gave him
positive signals during their inter-
actions. The Jets met with Trouba
in Pittsburgh earlier in the week,
which only made him listen more
intently when the Winnipeg first-

"You never know what's going

Trouba napped Friday and spent

to Pittsburgh converged on PNC

But after that, the honeymoon

and then tomorrow you go back to
hard work to justify why you were
drafted so high," Berenson said.
Berenson and Trouba used
the "hockey town" moniker to
describe Winnipeg. Trouba, who
grew up admiring Nicklas Lid-
strom and the Detroit Red Wings,
will feel right at home - once his
Michigan days are over, that is.

On Thursday, the Supreme Court
will announce its ruling on whether
portions of the Affordable Care Act
- also known as
"Obamacare" -
are constitution-
al. In March, the
court heard oral
arguments for
three days that ,
challenged and
defended vari-
ous parts of the MATTHEW
law. But people ZusKA1
are mostly inter-
ested in whether
the court will
strike down the individual man-
date, which requires most Ameri-
cans to either carry insurance or
pay a penalty.
Three days of hearings is an
extremely rare phenomenon in
modern Supreme Court cases,
but the court deemed it neces-
sary to spend a lot of time hearing
"Obamacare" arguments because
intelligent people, who study
these types of arguments for a
living, come down on both sides
of the mandate's constitutional-
ity. The questions the law raises
have no obvious answers, and a
reasonable person should be able
to respect thercourt's decision on
this difficult issue, even if he or
she disagrees with it. This, unfor-
tunately, will not happen, and it is
a disturbing example of America's
polarization.
On one hand, the court may
strike down the mandate. If the
Commerce Clause of the U.S.
Constitution, which regulates
interstate commerce, says that
Congress can force Americans
to buy health care, Congress also
could require Americans to buy
products from, say, a president's
campaign donor, since purchas-
ing any product that crosses state
lines affects interstate commerce.
To some people, the Commerce
Clause doesn't seem to be intended
to allow such laws.
On the other hand, previously
decided cases like Wickard v. Fil-
burn may provide precedent for
the court to uphold the mandate.
In Wickard v. Filburn, the court
ruled that Roscoe Wickard was
not allowed to grow more wheat on
his own land than the government
allowed, even if the wheat was
intended for his own consump-
tion, because growing extra wheat
would cause him to buy less. The
court decided that this affected
interstate commerce, so it's possi-
ble that the court may extend this
ruling because Americans' aggre-
gate decisions on whether to buy
health insurance affects its price.

The arguments for and against
the individual mandate are com-
plex, and both sides have their
merits. Yet the hashtag #Obam-
acare on Twitter has thousands
of tweets declaring that the man-
date is obviously constitutional or
unconstitutional, and if another
user has the opposite opinion, he
or she is an idiot. Why the court
wasted three days on this case is
anyone's -guess - the issue can
apparently be resolved in fewer
than 140 characters.
Polarization
stems from
biased sources.
Politics has never been as polar-
ized in my lifetime as it is now, and
I doubt our republic has thrived
for so many years by having its
citizens call each other idiots for
having differing opinions about
complex questions. I believe this
polarization exists because now
people only get their information
from extremely biased sources.
When I was a college freshman,
there was no Facebook or Twitter.
People's main sources of informa-
tion were the morning paper and
nightly news. People were given
all the information they needed
to form opinions and seemed to be
more respectful of others' opin-
ions. Since I've been in college
and graduate school, the nightly
news has morphed into shows
such as Rachel Maddow's and Bill
O'Reilly's, which give their viewers
all the bias they need to form the
exact same opinion as the show's
host. Meanwhile, most newspa-
pers essentially have become news
pamphlets, and everybody seems
to think everybody else is stupid.
Social media and cable news
aren't going away anytime soon,
but that doesn't mean you have
to become part of the troubling
trend produced by these mediums.
When the court makes its decision
this week, social media and cable
news will erupt with talk about the
stupidity of the court's decision.
Ignore their banter, and maybe, on
the way to work or school, pick up
a newspaper.

NHL DRA FT
Di Giuseppe picked in second round by Carolina

Do not sign a lease at 4 Eleven
Lofts
TO THE DAILY:
The title says it all - whatever you do - avoid Ster-
ling 4 Eleven Lofts at all costs. I wouldn't even rec-
ommend it as a last resort. As one reviewer writes
"Literally, being homeless would be better than liv-
ing here." I have lived at 4 Eleven Lofts for almost a
year, and am counting down the days until my lease
ends.
I thought about waiting until after I moved out to
write this letter, thinking thatI didn't want the 4 Elev-
en management to treat me any different after they
read this, but then I realized that the property manag-
ers couldn't treat me any worse than they already do.
And I seriously don't want anyone to have to experi-
ence the same torture as me by living at 4 Eleven Lofts.
Before signing my lease-last November, my room-
mate-to-be and I toured the building and were both
extremely impressed. Don't let this tour fool you.
They will tell you anything that you want to hear,
just so you can sign. Here are just two online reviews
on that: "The staff stop being nice to you RIGHT
after you sign the lease" and "Do not be fooled by,
the management as they try to convince you to sign

a lease, because after you do - they way they treat
you is the complete opposite. You are nothing to
them but a sack of money." The management here is
extremely rude and unhelpful. I'll admit that I have
had to pay my rent late before, but that should not
warrant a threat letter stating management's intent
to sue you. They love to charge you unnecessary fees:
$50 late fee for rent, $50 fee for lost keycard, $350
subletter fee (just to have someone subletyour room)
and a "cleaning" fee of $60, although even I could
have cleaned our apartment better than them.
The apartments themselves are sub-par. Manage-
ment does a very good job at fooling its customers
into thinking that the amenities and apartments
are luxurious, when they are not at all. The internet
is worse than the dial-up that I had in elementary
school. The walls of the apartment are razor thin,
as one reviewer writes, "no matter where you are
(I've been in many apt's), it seems as though you hear
noise from above, below, and to the sides."
Don't believe me? Check out google reviews, yahoo
reviews, newspaper and other online reviews. You
will find that almost everyone agrees with me, and
those that don't are most likely the 4 Eleven commu-
nity assistants reviewing the building themselves.
Avoid at all costs.

PITTSBURGH - Michi-
gan sophomore forward Phil Di
Giuseppe stood just feet away from
where future teammate Jacob
Trouba stood the night before and
made the same promise.

Though the Carolina Hur-
ricanes drafted his rights with
the 38th overall pick of the NHL
Entry Draft, Di Giuseppe will play
for the Wolverines this season.
"It's great hockey," Di Giuseppe
said of the Michigan experience.
"That's why I went to school there
and played there. I'm happy with

my decision and I'm happy to go
back next year."
Michigan coach Red Berenson
sat right behind Di Giuseppe as
his name was called, applauding
his forward's accomplishment, but
knowing he'll benefit from more
time in Ann Arbor.
"He's been around so many
prospects and so many NHL play-
ers," Di Giuseppe said of his coach.
"He had a lot of years in the NHL
himself. He knows so much about
the game and passes that on to
his players. That's why I think
the program has done so well -
because it was built around Red."
Most draft projections accu-
rately had Di Giuseppe going in
the early part of the second round,
so the timing wasn't a surprise,
but the team was something of one
for Di Giuseppe.
"I had no idea," Di Giuseppe

said. "It's kind of hard to tell....
I'm just proud to be drafted by this
organization.
"It's like a beauty contest. Obvi-
ously you want to go as high as
possible, but I couldn't be more
happy with where I am now or as
honored as I am now."
Carolina met with the Maple,
Ontario native at the NHL Scout-
ing Combine and liked what Di
Giuseppe, a promising scorer in
a proven system at Michigan,
brought to the table.
And from. that system, chock
full of skaters that have gone
through the draft process, came
the best advice Di Giuseppe
received going into the weekend.
"(Teammates) just told me how
to handle myself and not to get
caught up in it," Di Giuseppe said.
"I thought that helped a lot."
Di Giuseppe cited junior defen-

seman Jon Merrill, sophomore
forward Alex Guptill and senior
forward Kevin Lynch as team-
mates that provided valuable
insight.
He hadn't yet gotten a chance to
speak to Trouba since the Winni-
peg Jets selected him in the draft's
first round.
Di Giuseppe is coming off a
campaign that saw him emerge
as the team's second-best rookie.
Only forward Alex Guptill had
a better freshman season. Di
Giuseppe recorded 26 points for
the Wolverines in 2011-12.
"Last year, I came in strong and
started scoring right away," Di
Giuseppe said. "The biggest part
of my game that kind of fell was
my consistency. That's what I'll
work on in the summer. We lost
a couple guys so I'm going to be
relied on for scoring."

Push toward

entrepeneurship,
start-ups
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
ManagingEditor
Republican Gov. and Univer-
sity alum Rick Snyder joined a
crowd of more than 100 local
entrepreneurs, academics -and
engineers at the North Campus
Research Complex for the Entre-
preneurs Engage "unconference"
Thursday.
This interactive get-together,
hosted jointly by the University's
Office of Technology Transfer
and the Michigan Venture Capi-
tal Association, discussed prob-

lems facing businesses, interns,
CEOs and start-ups. The "uncon-
ference"had no agenda and only a
skeleton set of rules.
Snyder - the founder of
SPARK, an Ann Arbor-based
venture capital firm - said in an
interview with The Michigan
Daily before the event that there
are skilled educators, workers
and innovators in the state of
Michigan that aren't being con-
nected to businesses or capital.
"We need to do a better job of
what I described as 'talent match-
ing,' " Snyder said. "There's great
opportunity for people."
Stephen Forrest, the University
vice president for research, said
the University does a good job of
pushing students into entrepre-
neurship.
"What we need also is pull, pull

University excels in
graduation rates

Monts attributes
success to
admissions process
By KATIE BURKE
Daily StaffReporter
The University that touts its
students as "the leaders and the
best" compares well with 'peer
institutions in areas such as ath-
letics and research, but it is excel-
ling in graduating the students
who arrive on campus each year.
According to the College Board
Advocacy & Policy Center's Col-
lege Completion Agenda 2011
Progress Report, as college appli-
cation and tuition rates continue
to increase across the country, six-
year completion rates at four-year
public institutions throughout the
United States remained just above
55 percent in 2008. The rate for
public institutions in the state of
Michigan was 59.7 percent.
The University's Office of
Budget and Planning reported
in November 2011 a four-year
completion rate of 75.8 percent in
2007.
Lester Monts, senior vice pro-
vost for academic affairs, said in
an e-mail to The Michigan Daily
that the University's high gradu-
ation rates are mainly a product

of the University admissions pro-
cess.
"The Undergraduate Admis-
sions Office works tirelessly to
assemble the best possible incom-
ing class every year, a class that
is intellectually accomplished,
diverse and prepared to contrib-
ute to and succeed at the Univer-
sity," Monts wrote.
Monts added that the founda-
tion of University admissions is
supplemented by the interdisci-
plinary attention once students
arrive on campus.
. "People throughout the Uni-
versity, in every school and col-
lege, work to support and advance
(students') success," Motts wrote.
"These efforts are clearly paying
off."
According to the College Board
Report, freshman-to-sophomore
year retention rates are another
important factor in overall com-
pletion statistics.
"(The freshman-to-sophomore
year retention) indicator repre-
sents the persistence of students
from freshman to sophomore
year and provides insights into
students' progress through the
postsecondary education sys-
tem," the report read.
The report stated the national
retention rate from freshman to
sophomore year at four-year pub-
lic institutions as 78.2 percent in

from the community," he said.
"The need of the community with
the capability of the University
(needs to) match."
Only a few years ago, Pfizer
Inc. occupied the large com-
plex but closed down, leaving an
empty monument.
"When Pfizer left, it was a big
blow to the community," Snyder
said. "I was there when all that
took place."
Despite Pfizer's departure, Sny-
der said the University and Ann
Arbor will grow economically
now that they have adopted an
entrepreneurial attitude and more
businesses continue to start up.
"This campus eventually will
be stronger than it was when Pfiz-
er was here, over the longer term,"
Snyder said. "And this (event) is
part of the reflection of that. It
2008.
The Office of Budget and Plan-
ning reported in November 20tt
a retention rate of 96 percent in
2008.
Mark Kantrowitz, creator and
publisher of the college planning
resource FinAid, said mounting
student debt is a factor of low com-
pletion rates across the country.
"These are students for whom
a few hundred dollars' difference
in the amounts of money increas-
es the likelihood of their drop-
ping out of college," Kantrowitz
said. "Sometimes students look at
how much debt they've accumu-
lated, and they drop out because
they notice that there's absolutely
no way they're going to repay the
debt even if they do graduate."
Kantrowitz said factors that
contribute to the high amount
of debt are living expenses and
interest rates for both private and
federal loans.
Kantrowitz said he thinks stu-
dents should research the costs of
college education and take advan-
tage of resources such as scholar-
ships, grants and part-time jobs
to allow them to minimize their
debt and avoid dropping out.
According to Monts, the only
difference between University
students and other college stu-
dents is their preparedness in
entering higher education.
"Once here, U-M students work
as hard as any other students any-
where else in the world," Monts
wrote. "We are pleased with this
result, and look forward to con-
tinued graduation rate improve-
ments in coming years."

doesn't happen overnight, but it's
on a path to be even better."
Rich Sheridan, the keynote
speaker of the event and the CEO
of Menlo Innovations, explained
how in the face of the loss of Pfiz-
er, 70 community leaders were
gathered by SPARK to discuss the
future of Ann Arbor and Michi-
gan.
Sheridan said he addressed the
group, much to Snyder's surprise,
describing a future where Sny-
der was governor and Michigan
was regrouping. Now, Sheridan
said.we are coming closer to that
future.
"Back then we were all scared
... we weren't sure what was going
to happen next," he said. "Today,
... this is a community that's
weathered the storm, and now
we're ready to move forward, and

we are moving forward." .
Conference attendee Judy Yu,
a University alum who is now
an engineer ate BD Biosciences,
went to the event when her hus-
band's startup was invited by
SPARK.
"I've been to entrepreneurshil'
conferences, but usually a couple
guys stand up and talk," Yu said.
"This is very much spur-of-the-
moment ... it kind of more reflects
the interest of the group rather
than the interest of the speaker."
Yu also said the event could
involve students better.
"I wished they would have
more of these that involve stu-
dents directly because most of
these are geared towards a larger
community," Yu said. "I wouldoi,
feel very welcome if I were a stu-
dent coming here."
