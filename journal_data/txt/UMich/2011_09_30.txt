OFFIC OF ADMISSIONS
Admissions at
'U' still need-
blind despite
funding cuts

FOOTLOOSE FRATERNITY

Nationwide survey:
More universities prefer
applicants who don't
need financial aid
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily StaffReporter
After states have slashed their bud-
gets for higher education funding, some
universities are favoring applicants
who don't need financial assistance to
cover tuition.
In the last year, more than 50 per-
cent of public research universities
have been trying to recruit more stu-
dents who don't require financial aid,
according to a Sept. 21 New York Times
article. However, University of Michi-
gan admissions officials say decisions
to admit University students are not
based on applicants' financial statuses
and that the University is need-blind.
The New York Times article report-
ed the results of a survey of 462 admis-
sions officials at public universities
conducted by Inside Higher Ed - an
online higher education source. Admis-
sions directors who responded to the
survey said they are seeking more stu-
dents who do not need financial aid,
including out-of-state and internation-
al applicants.
However, Ted Spencer, the Uni-
versity's associate vice provost and
executive director of undergraduate

admissions, wrote in an e-mail inter-
view that the University of Michigan
hasn't changed its admissions practices
and will continue making admissions
decisions regardless of applicants' abil-
ities to pay for tuition.
"Michigan is a need-blind institu-
tion," Spencer wrote. "Thus, admis-
sions decisions are made entirely
separately from financial reporting or
concerns."
In The New York Times article,
David Hawkins, the director of pub-
lic policy and research at the National
Association for College Admission
Counseling, attributed the number
of colleges eliminating of need-blind
admissions to dwindling state funding
for higher education and universities'
desires to uphold their reputations.
"As institutional pressures mount,
between the decreased state funding,
the pressure to raise a college's pro-
file, and the pressure to admit certain
students, we're seeing a fundamental
change in the admissions process,"
Hawkins told The New York Times.
In Michigan, state funding for high-
er education will decrease by 15 percent
for the 2012 fiscal year. The decrease
translates to a $47.5-million cut in state
appropriations for the University.
The University increased tuition by
6.7 percent and 4.9 percent for in-state
and out-of-state students, respective-
ly, for this year. Compared to the last
academic year, in-state students are
paying $797 more, and out-of-state stu-

Trial run fond

By MARY HANNAHAN
Daily StaffReporter
With bright blue receptacles and the
words "Planet Blue" displayed in large
text, the latest additions to the Diag are
hard to miss.
Blue frames now deck six new recy-
cling bins, which were placed beside
trash cans around the Diag last week.
The University plans to use the six bins
as a trial run to see if students actually
use them for recycling, according to
Tracy Artley, sustainability programs
coordinator for Plant Building and
Ground Services at the University. If
properly used, the goal is to eventually
increase the number of recycling bins
across campus.
Each recycling bin has a sign depict-
ing the different materials that can and
cannot be recycled. Items considered
trash, such as sandwich wrappers and
coffee cups, are represented on the sign
with a red "no" placed over the illus-
trations, while pictures of recyclable

CONCERTS ON CAMPUS
Indie group Fleet Foxes play to
nearly sold-out Hill Auditorium

Grease fire causes
minor damage to nearby
businesses on Main St.
By TIANYU TANG
For the Daily
After a severe fire last month, Sheesh
Mediterranean Cuisine on Main Street
has not yet reopened its doors for busi-
ness.

The fire at Sheesh restaurant, located
at 207 North Main St., occurred on Aug.
22 at about 11 a.m. A grease fire caused
the incident, which also affected busi-
nesses neighboring Sheesh, according
to Reka Farrakand, a fire inspector for
the Ann Arbor Fire Department.
The fire took five hours to extinguish
and smoke damage was more substan-
tial due to the age of the building, Far-
rakand said.

Playing album favorites
and new material, band
gets standing ovation
By JOE CADAGIN
DailyFineArts Editor
In the world of indie rock, one
bearded, plaid-wearing group, of
mountain men has been attracting
quite alot of attention.
Since their debut, selitled album
was released in 2008, Fleet Foxes have
soared to fame and evengained some
mainstream recognition. Last night,
the band played a nearly sold-out
concert at Hill Auditorium as part of
a tour that will lead them across the

United States and onto Europe, Japan,
Australia and New Zealand.
"I thought it was pretty fantastic,"
said Public Policy junior Michael
Bloom after the show. "Hill Auditori-
um has the best acoustics in the Mid-
west, so you know, it really topped it
off."
Hill Auditorium often hosts classi-
cal music concerts - the last popular
music artist to play at the venue was
rapper Lupe Fiasco in April. The audi-
torium is recognized by many as atop
venue, and with a capacity of 3,561
audience members, it's an ideal place
for Ann Arbor to hold high-profile
concerts.
"Hill's really cool, because it's really
easy to hear," said LSA junior Elana
Firsht. "I may be in the mezzanine, but

it felt like Iwas in the front row."
Even Fleet Foxes's lead singer Robin
Pecknold remarked from onstage that
Hill is "so beautiful and funto play in."
Formed in 2006 in Seattle, Wash.,
Fleet Foxes have released two EPs
and two full-length albums. The lat-
est, Helplessness Blues, came out in
May and garnered near-perfect rat-
ings from Pitchfork, allmusic.com and
Rolling Stone magazine.
Part of Fleet Foxes's popularity
is due to their folksy, Appalachian-
inspired melodies, blending elements
of rock with traditional American
music. Many of their songs seem to
come straight out of a log cabin in the
Adirondacks.
"I like their folky, indie, kind of off-

Gov. Snyder visits
Shanghai on Asian
trade mission
Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder is
seeing lots of opportunities for
Michigan businesses to sell to
China as he works to attract Chi-
nese companies to the state during
a weeklong trade trip to Southeast
Asia.
"A lot have already established
small businesses in Michigan or
are looking at coming to Michi-
gan," the Republican governor
told The Associated Press in a
phone call last night. It was Friday
morning in Shanghai, and the gov-
ernor was at the airport prepar-
ing to fly to his last stop in South
Korea before returning to Michi-
gan over the weekend.
Snyder had been to Taiwan
about 10 times in the 1990s when
he was an executive with com-
puter maker Gateway and also had
visited HongKong. He had visited
the Chinese mainland only once
until this trip.
BOSTON
Man arrested for
remote-controlled
plane bomb plot
Model airplanes are suddenly
on the public's radar as potential
terrorist weapons. A 26-year-old
man from a Boston suburb was
arrested Wednesday and accused
of plotting to attack the Pentagon
and the U.S. Capitol with remote-
controlled model planes packed
with explosives.
These are not balsa-wood-and-
rubber-band toys investigators
are talking about. The FBI said
Rezwan Ferdaus hoped to use
military-jet replicas, 5 to 71/2 feet
long, guided by GPS devices and
capable of speeds over 100 mph.
Federal officials have long been
aware of the possibility someone
might try to use such planes as
weapons, but there are no restric-
tions on their purchase - Ferdaus
is said to have bought his over the
Internet.
TORONTO
Ice shelves near
Canada melting
Two ice shelves that exist-
ed before Canada was settled
by Europeans diminished sig-
nificantly this summer, one
nearly disappearing altogether,
Canadian scientists say in newly
published research.
The loss is important as a mark-
er of global warming, returning
the Canadian Arctic to conditions
that date back thousands of years,
scientists say. Floating icebergs
that have broken free as a result
pose a risk to offshore oil facilities
and potentially to shipping lanes.
The breaking apart of the ice
shelves also reduces the environ-
ment that supports microbial life
and changes the look of Canada's
coastline.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
Pakistan leaders
unite, back army
Pakistan's political leaders
voiced their support yesterday for
the country's powerful army in
its destabilizing standoff with the
United States over allegations the
force supports insurgents attack-
ing American troops in Afghani-
stan.
More than 40 political party
leaders signed a resolution after
a 10-hour meeting in the capital
called by Prime Minister Reza
Yousuf Gilani to formulate a
response to fresh American claims
that the army and the nation's spy
agency is supporting the Haqqani
network. U.S. officials say the
Haqqani group is based on the
Pakistani side of the Afghan bor-
der and is the most deadly militant
faction in Afghanistan.
The vaguely worded resolu-
tion, born of compromise between
the country's feuding parties and
reflective of many of their anti-
American and pro-Islamist views,
called for peace with insurgents in
Afghanistan.

The future of the restaurant
remains unknown. The owner
of Sheesh did not respond to
numerous inquiries from The
Michigan Daily.
Eric Schreffler, co-owner of
nearby computer store Myth-
logic at 209 North Main St., said
he is unsure of the current situa-
tion of Sheesh and hasn't heard
anything about the restaurant's
reopening.
Mythlogic had minimal
smoke damage from the fire. The
computer store subsequently
hired a cleaning company, and
the store opened again for busi-
ness several days after the fire,
Schreffler said.
all-time high, Jerry May, the
University's vice president for

meeting earlier this month. In
July, the regents approved a
$137-million increase in finan-
cial aid to assist students given
the current economic crisis.

Schreffler said. "We are pretty

Similarly, the other busi-

affected by the fire. While the
shop - which sells fruit gift bas-
kets - was minimally damaged,
storeowner Michelle Toul said
she was already planning to relo-
cate the business to Washtenaw

Toul said.
this year will be released next
month.
Margaret Rodriguez, senior
associate director of the Uni-
versity's Office of Financial
Aid, wrote in an e-mail inter-
view that 64 percent of enrolled
undergraduate students
received financial assistance for
the 2010-2011 academic year.
Additionally, 17,211 undergradu-
ate students received a scholar-
ship, grant, loan or work-study
award last year.

RECYCLING
From Page 1
there now are very material-
specific and they use a lot of
graphics," Artley stated. "We're
hoping that being very specific,
and using graphics will lead to
much lower contamination rates
so that their contents actually
can be recycled."
According to Artley, the Uni-
versity has a contract with the
city of Ann Arbor's recycling
facility. Loads of recyclable
materials have to be thrown out
if more than 9 percent of the
volume in each recycling bin is
trash.
Eco-conscious volunteers
tested the effectiveness of the
recycling bins during EarthFest
on Tuesday by sorting through
the bins to compare waste versus
recyclable items. According to
Artley, 25 percent of the volume
in the recyclable bins was trash
- indicating that more educa-
tion on recycling is necessary
before more bins can be placed
on campus.
"When they're used as trash
cans, we have to dispose of the
contents as if it were trash, and
then it looks like we're not really
recycling," Artley said.
LSA senior Samantha
Schiebold, a project manager
for the University's Student Sus-
tainability Initiative, said the
placement of the recycling bins
was the result of a conversation
between members of SSI, Michi-
gan Student Assembly's Envi-
ronmental Issues Commission
and LSA Student Government.
The three organizations
were concerned about the lack
of recycling bins near the Diag.
Schiebold also started a petition
in April to have recycling bins on
the Diag. The petition garnered
more than 700 signatures in its
first three days.
In the future, Schiebold said
she would like to see a one-to-

one ratio of trash bins to recycle
bins on campus because she
thinks convenience will get
more students to recycle.
"Most likely, students will not
recycle just because it is incon-
venient to do so," she said. "By
having the recycling bins very
visible and very easy to use, it is
going to divert a huge amount
of recyclable materials from the
landfill."
LSA senior Cameron LaFleur
said he has notseen the recycling
bins on the Diag and doesn't
have a need for them, though he
still supports the initiative.
"I have a CamelBak, so I don't
really have water bottles a ton,"
he said. "But I think it's a good
thing for the environment and
for the University."
LSA freshman Christopher
Hunt said he has noticed the
blue bins because they stand out
from the usual black trash bins.
"They are definitely brightly
colored, and the signage is good,"
Hunt said. "So they're definitely
promoting it, and I think it's a
great effort."
Kinesiology senior Dan Ritter
said he has used the recycling
bins but didn't notice the signs
on top indicating which materi-
als are recyclable and which are
not.
"It'd probably be helpful if
they made it more obvious," Rit-
ter said. "It's a good idea, but for
me it didn't matter because they
have recyclable bins inthe build-
ing, and I would carry some-
thing - if I finished my drink
outside - into the building."
LSA sophomore Alexandra
Brill said though she already
knew what materials to recycle,
she believes the images on the
sign are helpful to students who
aren't accustomed to recycling.
"I think it's great because
I know that whenever I have
something I need to recycle, I
have to go inside a building to do
it, but now that they're outside
it's a lot easier," Brill said.


FLEET FOXES

beat sound," Firsht said.
That sound is also a result
of the band's rich and complex
harmonies, which bring to mind
folk groups of the '60s like The
Mamas and the Papas and Peter,
Paul and Mary. In last night's
show, Fleet Foxes incorporated
unlikely instruments includ-
ing the mandolin, flute and har-
monium - giving their songs a
unique, rustic flavor.
A giant screen greeted con-
certgoers with the cheeky

phrase "YOU ARE AT A MUSI-
CAL CONCERT CONGRATU-
LATIONS" projected over a
scenic picture-postcard image
of a mountain range. The mostly
college-aged audience burst into
applause when Fleet Foxes open-
ing act, The Walkmen, took the
stage.
The five East Coast-based
members of The Walkmen have
a driving and energetic garage-
band style. One particularly
bouncy number, "Blue as your
Blood," spurred two audience
members to alternately bounce
up and down in their seats like a
see-saw.

Fleet Foxes took the stage
after a 15-minute set change,
playing songs from Helplessness
Blues, as well as hits from their
eponymous debut LP. After a
long standing ovation, the band
returned to the stage to play two
encores. The first, "I Let You,"
is a previously unrecorded song
that Pecknold said he wrote a
few months ago.
The band will stay in the
Midwest for the weekend, play-
ing shows in Chicago today and
tomorrow.

U.S. .criticizes
U.N. for failure
to cut budget


United Nations
proposed budget at
$5.2 billion
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
The United States criticized
the U.N. yesterday for not mak-
ing deeper cuts in its proposed
$5.2 billion budget for the next
two years amid an economic
crisis that has forced member
states to make far greater sac-
rifices.
Ambassador Joseph M. Tor-
sella, U.S. representative for
management and reform to the
United Nations, told the U.N.
budget committee that the cur-
rent plan eliminates just 44
positions from a work force of
10,307 - a mere 0.4 percent.
At the same time, said Tor-
sella, an expected "onslaught
of add-ons" could push the cur-
rent proposal for the 2012-13
budget as high as $5.5 billion.
U.N. member states includ-
ing Brazil, South Africa and
Mexico are finding ways to do
more with fewer resources, he

added.
The world economic crisis
"has made financial resources
ever more scarce, made efficient
outcomes ever more important,
and made leaders - including
every one of us in this room
today - ever more accountable
to the citizens we represent for
the fiscal decisions we make,"
he said.
Torsella said that U.N. chief
Ban Ki-moon early this year
called on managers to trim 3
percent from their proposed
spending plans, but "not all of
the organization has risen to
the challenge set by the Secre-
tary-General."
For a decade, the U.S. ambas-
sador said, the U.N..operating
budget has grown,."dramati-
cally, relentlessly, and expo-
nentially: from $2.6 billion in
2001-2002, to $5.4 billion in
2010-2011."
He said that growth has sig-
nificantly outpaced the growth
of the budgets of nearly all
member states that fund the
world organization through
assessments.

White Market shouldn't close its doors
White Market has been a grocery staple for countless stu-
dents over the past 62 years. However, the Williams
Street building the store occupies was recently sold, and
the White Market owners are unsure about the future of their lease.
If White Market were to close, there would be no other place on cam-
pus for students to get fresh produce and affordable groceries. Stu-
dents should voice concerns about the potential closing of the store
and support local shops and restaurants to ensure they continue to
thrive in Ann Arbor.

ter." Years ago,

HARSHA
NAHATA

Last week, the building that houses White
Market was sold after being on the market for
over a year. The current owners of the market,
Dave and Darlene Jones, are unsure whether
they will renew their lease, which expires
at the end of the year. They told The Michi-
gan Daily their business's survival depends
on negotiations with the new landlord and
expressed interest in their customers and a
desire to continue supplying students with
fresh food.
Currently, there are few grocery stores
available to students on campus within a walk-
ing distance - and even fewer that offer fresh
fruits and vegetables. Last year, Village Corner,
on the corner of South University and South
Forest avenues, closed its doors. While CVS
and 7-Eleven convenience stores have recently
opened oh State Street, they only provide lim-
ited produce options. There is a grocery store
beneath Zaragon Place on East University Ave-
nue, but much of the food is gourmet and not
affordable for most students. If White Market
closes, students on campus will have no fresh,
affordable grocery shopping options.
While Meijer, Whole Foods and Kroger
are all located near campus, they require
either car or bus transportation, which poses

a struggle for many students who don't have
access to a vehicle. Relying on the AATA bus,
and carrying several bags of groceries also is
not convenient. A grocery store within walk-
able distance is a necessity for students who
live on or near campus.
Many local shops have left Ann Arbor over
the years, and State Street has become an
increasingly commercial shopping area. While
it's important for students to have options for
where they shop and eat, they should real-
ize the important contributions that locally
owned businesses make to the city of Ann
Arbor. Small businesses stimulate the local
economy and help give Ann Arbor its charac-
ter, which improves the environment where
students live and go to school.
Shopping at and supporting local business-
es is what helps the Ann Arbor community
grow and continue to thrive. Locally owned
shops like White Market contribute to the
success of the Ann Arbor economy. If White
Market doesn't renew its lease, students and
others who live and work in downtown Ann
Arbor will be left with fewer options for gro-
cery shopping. Students should support White
Market, so they can continue to have afford-
able, fresh food options on campus.

teen bullying.
Fourteen-year-old Jamey Rode-
meyer committed suicide in his
New York home on Sunday, Sept.
18. Rodemeyer was just starting his
freshman year of high school. For the
past couple years, he complained of
being bullied on the Internet regard-
ing his sexual orientation. Parents
and friends expressed outrage over
harassment and gay slurs directed
toward Jamey. According to local
reports, one post on a social network
read, "JAMIE IS STUPID, GAY, FAT
ANND ... UGLY. HE MUST DIE!"
Another claimed, "I wouldn't care if
you died. No one would. So just do it
:) It would make everyone WAY more
happier!"
Unfortunately, Jamey is one per-
son on a long list of bullying victims.
According to the National Center for
Educational Statistics, during the
2008-2009 school year, 28 percent
of students between ages 12 and 18
reported being bullied in school. The
most prominent form of bullying isn't
through physical aggression, but
through ridicule, insults and rumors.
A 2009 survey by the Gay, Lesbian
and Straight Education Network
reveals that 85 percent of gay and
transgender high school students
claim they've been harassed because
of sexual orientation and 60 percent
because of gender identity. The Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Preven-
tion estimate that everyday 160,000
kids across the country stay home

from school because they are afraid
of being bullied.
This is unacceptable. School is
a second home - it's a place that
should be comfortable and secure
at the very least, if not warm and
welcoming. No child should be stay-
ing home because they are afraid
to go to school, or don't feel safe in
the classroom or among their peers.
There is no justification for bullying
and no justification for a child feel-
ing anxious about going to school in
the morning or coming home feeling
worthless.
But simply reiterating that bully-
ing is bad won't make it go away. To
combat bullying in schools, everyone
needs to play their part. And that
doesn't mean just not being a bully.
It means speaking out against hurt-
ful comments; it means watching
what you say and, more importantly,
whatyou don't say; it means goingup
to the student who's being taunted
and reassuringhim or her that you're
there, that they're not alone. It's not
just about professing tolerance, it's
about empathizing and understand-
ing; it's about letting people in when
the world shutsthem out.
And it's about making sure the
right laws are in place to protect stu-
dents. Michigan is one of few states
that has yet to enact anti-bullying
legislation. And that isn't because
the bullying problem somehow magi-
cally skipped Michigan. In January,,
the American Association of Uni-
versity Women of the University of.
Michigan testified on bullying claim-
ing that in the past year, 24 percent
of Michigan high school students
reported being bullied on school
property, and 7.4 percent of high
school students reported missing
school because they felt unsafe. The
problem is there. Now the solution
needs to be too.
It's difficult, if not impossible, to
take a tough stance against bullying
without comprehensive anti-bully-
ing legislation. Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder and the Michigan State Board

of Education have recommended
clear legislation, but so far that call
hasn't been adequately answered.
The recently passed anti-bullying
bill in the State Senate attempts to
address the issue but falls short. It
neither requires schools to accept the
outlined policies, nor does it clarify
the process by whichteachers should
report bullying - basically render-
ing the bill useless. We can do more.
We have to do more. And we have to
demand our legislators do more.
Students should
treat each other
with respect.

Jamey was involved with the
"It Gets Better" campaign, which
spreads awareness about teen bully-
ing via Facebook and Youtube. One
of his final posts stated, "I always say
how bullied I am, but no one listens.
...What do I have to do so people will
listen to me?" What more has to be
done? How many more victims do
we have to hear about before we start
taking this seriously?
October is National Anti-Bullying
Awareness month. Don't let Jamey's
story fade into the backdrop - don't
let it be something you hear about,
feel bad about and then forget in the
routine of daily life. Speak up, do
something - whether it's watching
your words, making a stranger feel
welcome, cheering up someone who
is down or spamming your legisla-
tors. Bullying isn't just between the
bully and the victim. It's something
we all should work to stop. In the
words of Martin Luther King Jr., we
can't become silent about things that
matter.

Try to pencil in flaws

Let me preface this by saying that the rest
of this article will be written by my ratio-
nal brain. My irrational metaphorical heart
jumped up and down, got warm and fuzzy
and screamed at the TV when Blaine and Kurt
from Fox's "Glee"finally kissed. My irrational
heart waited three years for Calvin to decide
his feelings for Heath were more important
than the fact that they are in rival fraterni-
ties in ABC Family's "Greek." My irrational
heart wanted to smack Georgia upside her
face when she accidentally outed Eric and
Jonathon on the CW's "Gossip Girl." My irra-
tional heart loved the family dynamic of Cam
and Mitchell of Fox's "Modern Family." And
I can't wait for Brittany and Santana to say
"screw guys and their head games" and finally
be together on "Glee."
But my brain worries about Hollywood TV
shows bombarding viewers with gay charac-
ters. Are they actually tryingto show the real-
ity for gay couples or are they just trying to be
politically correct? Are theytrying to advance
the plot, or are they just going along with the
Hollywood line, "we accept gay people?" Do
they really care about these characters or are
they just trying to get a wider audience and
media attention?
Every time there is a gay kiss on primetime
television - like on the "Dawson's Creek"
season finale in 2000 - the media explodes.
Every time, they say this is the first time gays
have been portrayed this way. When Blaine
and Kurt kissed on "Glee" for the first time last
season, many entertainment news sites came
out with articles that had different forms
of the headline "First Honest Gay Relation-
ship on TV." I personally know this is untrue
because "Greek" debuted a stereotype-break-
ing, open gay relationship - in a fraternity no
less - three years ago. And not only did this
gay character have serious emotional relation-

ships, but also the drunken one-night stands
that stereotype the college experience.
The most prevalent gay relationships on
TV are on "Glee," with half the relationships
being between same-sex partners. The creator
of "Glee" is a gay male who has publicly stated
that the struggles Kurt faces are loosely based
on his own. The Blaine and Kurt storyline is
one that many viewers, including myself, love.
I think the idea of a confident gay teenage boy
in a relationship with a boy who needs a role
model, following an attack from a homophobic,
in-the-closet bully, is very important. Where I
become skeptical is the Brittany/Santana rela-
tionship. It seems forced and unrealistic. Their
"girl cuddling" and their tearful rendition of
"Landslide" seem like the writer's way of bal-
ancing out the much-loved male gay relation-
ship and saying, "Hey, we like lesbians too."
There are fewer lesbian relationships on
television than male gay relationships. It is my
belief that mostly women watch these types
of shows, and girls find male gay relationships
cuterthanlesbian relationships, whereas men,
stereotypically, claim to like lesbian hook-ups.
Agood example is Fox's "House," where Olivia
Wilde had a straight relationship, but a ran-
dom, lesbian hook up. "House" is a show that
is watched by both men and women, unlike
"Greek" or "Glee" that draw a predominantly
female audience.
At least "Glee" focuses on these relation-
ships and tries to make them part of the story,
but the worst is shows like "Gossip Girl." They
have awkwardly inserted gay characters like
Eric and Jonathan just to have them there.
They rarely are featured in the episodes, and
there has been no gay kiss on the show. It
seems as if they are only there in an effort to
be PC or, more accurately, Hollywood Correct.

've never been a perfection-
ist. I never colored inside the
lines of my princess coloring
books. I never
had good hand-
writing, and
the part in my
hair was never
entirely straight.
But I've always
had perfection
on my mind, LEAH
in the way I'm POTKIN
sure every other PTKIN _
overachieving
University stu-
dent does. I want to be the perfect
student, daughter and friend, and
I try hard not to make mistakes
while striving to be all those things.
However, the esteemed English
Prof. John Rubadeau mentioned
something this past week in class
that really got my wheels turn-
ing. He told my class to look at our
pencils and asked us what was on
the top. Well, of course the answer
was an eraser. The lesson? Pencils
have erasers because the users are
expected to make mistakes - sim-
ple as that. Everyone learns from
the time they're in elementary
school that it's ok to make mistakes
and that people learn from their
mistakes. But, in an environment
as competitive as the University,
the long-taught lesson is easily for-
gotten. Sure it's important to work
hard and strive to do your best, but
it's not always about that extra club
position or the A+ papers. Some-
times, it's just about learning, and

if that learning comes from making
mistakes, so be it.
This lesson rings true for me the
most in my writing. The key to writ-
ing is rewriting, says my profes-
sor. The key is to mess up, and then
fix the mess you made. Students
shouldn't be afraid to go to a profes-
sor or tutor with "stupid" questions
because it is by asking those ques-
tions and making the mistakes in the
first place that the student learns.
For me, the pencil-eraser analogy is
more of a type and delete scenario,
as I know it is for many students. But
even the computer doesn't truly let
students realize their own mistakes,
as the computer has spell-check and
a built-in thesaurus. I'll be honest,
I'd be lost without spell-check, but
it certainly wouldn't hurt me to see
my mistakes pointed out by someone
other than the Microsoft paper clip
helper, as I hardly register my mis-
takes when they are auto-corrected
without my knowing. While it might
take a bit more effort to notice and
correct my mistakes, the extra work
is worth it.
Learning from mistakes doesn't
only apply to writing. It is appli-
cable in all walks of life, embody-
ing everything from lackluster jobs
and internships, to failed relation-
ships and business endeavors. If not
for making the mistake of accepting
the first internship I was offered
this past summer - which turned
out to be very disappointing - I
wouldn't have realized my passion
for an entirely different field of work.
Many of the world's great discover-

ies resulted from mistakes, including
post-it notes, chocolate chip cook-
ies, and America, to name a few. The
examples could go on for pages, but
I'm sure each reader has a similar E
example of his orher own.

Learning comes
from making
mistakes.

I know all too many students who
stress over A's vs. A+'s, suffer from a
too heavy workload and endlessly
plan all aspects of their daily lives
hoping to portray themselves as the
perfect package, or ratherthe perfect
job candidate. But striving for per-
fection and being afraid of making
a mistake can inhibit students from
taking risks that will challengethem,
and ultimately will stifle creativ-
ity and experimentation - essential
tools for learning and achievement in
life. So although it seems cliche, I can
only hope that students take a second
to remind themselves of this child-
hood lesson, as it applies as much at
the age of 20 as it did at age 9 - if
not more. So, we all know that it is
always good to strive to be your best,
but ultimately, if you make some mis-
takes along the way, well, that's what
erasers are for. 4

Th Mchga tDily,, ciadalcmFiay etme-3,21
3':

Stuck behind Adam
Weber for two seasons,
all 6-foot-4, 240 pounds
of MarQueis Gray found
room at wide receiver for
Minnesota.
Now, he's the start-
ing quarterback, and the
uber-athletic Gray may
be the most dangerous
thing about a rebuilding
Golden Gophers team.
His 521 pass yards and
351 rushing yards can
attest to that.
At Big Ten Media Day
in August, Gray sat down
with the Daily to talk
about the upcoming sea-
son:
The Michigan Daily: How
dangerous are you with your legs?
MarQueis Gray, Most people
say I'm a dual-threat, and when
a play breaks down, I just try and
get the first down. If it enables me
to run, then I'll do it.
TMD: Dual-threat quarter-
backs get the reputation that they
can't throw the ball well. Do you
hear that? How do you feel about
that?
Gray: I feel like I'm a great
passer.
That stings a little bit to know
that when you get that title of
dual-threat quarterback, people
don't know - they only consider
that you can run. But once you
show that you can hit the deep
ball and those impossible passes,
then people will start warming up

to you.
TMD: But how confident are
you in your ability to make all the
throws?
Gray: I'm more confident now
than I was when I first start-
ed playing quarterback again
because I've been having more
reps to throw the ball. I've been
taking all the reps now in our
summer workouts.
TMD: I'm sure you've seen
Denard Robinson play. How do
you think you compare to him?
Gray: Just being a dual-threat
quarterback.
He's been able to showcase his
talents the last couple of years and
show that having a dual-threat
quarterback is hard to stop. And
hopefully, having a dual-threat
quarterback (at Minnesota), it'll
be hard to stop us.
TMD: How fast are you?
Gray: I can say I'm nowhere
as fast as Shoelace, but I've got a
good amount of speed to me.
TMD: If you look at Antwaan
Randle El, Brad Smith and other
college quarterbacks that play
wide receiver in the NFL, did you
ever think about not playing quar-
terback and focusing on playing
wide receiver at the next level?
Gray: I always wanted to play
quarterback - that's my child-
hood dream. But if that's the way
I'm going to get into the NFL,
then so be it. Being in the NFL is a
childhood dream of mine also.
TMD: What's it like to finally
be a quarterback?

Gray: I haven't played quar-
terback since my senior year of
high school, and I've been itching
to get back and I finally get the
chance to.
TMD: What's it been like mov-
ing around to different positions,
have you always wanted to be a
quarterback?
Gray: Yeah, I've always want-
ed to be a quarterback. But just
wasn't able to get that name
attached to the end of mine. It is
what it is, and I'm looking for-
ward to being a quarterback this
year.
TMD: Did you take snaps at
quarterback your first two sea-
sons?
Gray: When I first got here,
that's when I took most of my
snaps.
I was like legitimately second-
team (quarterback). Then last
year, they had me warm up with
the quarterbacks then I went with
the receivers throughoutpractice.
TMD: Did your former coach
Tim Brewster say to you, 'Hey,
you're a great athlete, we need
you to be on the field?' Because
you did have Adam Weber in front
of you.
Gray: Yeah, that's exactly what
he said. I said, 'Coach, I don't feel
like I can help this team from the
sideline.' He figured out I could
play receiver and that's what I did.
TMD: What did you learn
about being a quarterback from
playing wide receiver?
Gray: That's another way to

learn defenses.
But being a receiver you have
to learn how to sit down in cer-
tain holes in zone coverages and
myself, I can teach some of our
younger guys - to some of the
freshman wide receivers and
quarterbacks comingin - I canbe
a quarterbacks coach and a wide
receivers coach, because I did it
lastyear.
TMD: What's your coach Jerry
Kill like?
Gray: He's a little fiery guy. We
love him a lot. From the first time
he got here, he's been on us about
discipline, hard work and playing
fast.

Junior quarterback MarQueis Gray has thrown for more than 500 yards and has run for nearly 400 in four games this

Minnesota has no answers for Blue

MARISSA MCCLAIN/Daily
Michigan coach Brady Hoke has focused on winning the Big Ten since his introductory press conference back in January.
eyes prize: Big Ten Title

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
When Brady Hoke took the
podium for the first time as
Michigan football coach on Jan.
11, he made the team's initial goal
abundantly clear: win the Big
Ten Championship.
His sights weren't set on the
national title - not just yet, at
least.
"If you don't win your con-
ference championship, there's
no way in heck you're winning
the National Championship," he
said.
Hoke set the tone early.
When he first addressed the
team, it didn't take long for Hoke
to mention the Big Ten title.
"(Right) when he walked in
the door," redshirt sophomore
offensive lineman Taylor Lewan
said.
After "This is Michigan, for
God's sakes" and demanding to
know who thought head coach at
Michigan was no longer an elite
position, his five Big Ten rings
said everything he missed.
As fall descends on Ann Arbor,
this is when that elite job gets
tough: Brady Hoke, meet the Big
Ten season. Championships are
won in November, but late Sep-
tember isn't a bad time to get
started.
The Wolverines have entered
the Big Ten portion of the sched-
* ule unbeaten in each of the past
three seasons.
But the conference slate hasn't
been kind.

Michigan was 1-7 in Big Ten
games in 2009, 3-5 last season.
Progress, yes. But for the play-
ers, it's been an embarrassment.
"It's not acceptable by any-
one's standards," said fifth-year
senior defensive tackle Ryan
Van Bergen. "The guys who have
played here before us left a leg-
acy of competing for a Big Ten
championship, and we haven't
even been close.
"You can see our record
against Big Ten opponents, and
it hasn't been anywhere close to
where it needs to be. Who cares
about being 4-0 in non-confer-
ence? Yeah, it'd be great to be 4-0
rather than 0-4, but it doesn't
matter once you start Big Ten."
Even through spring camp,
fall camp and the non-confer-
ence schedule, Hoke has repeat-
ed the team's primary goal again
and again.
During fall camp, the Michi-
gan Stadium tunnel got a new
paint job, featuring former Mich-
igan coach Bo Schembechler's
famous phrase, "The team, the
team, the team."
Just beside Mi 's locker
room door, a fres rose was
painted on the wall alongside
a list of each of th 42 seasons
that Michigan has n the con-
ference champions
Hoke's given th layers all
the motivation theyneed.
The Wolverines haven't
topped the conf ce since
2004 - the longe ought in
Michigan football tory since
the early 1960s.

"The expectation is to win the
Big Ten Championship," Hoke
said. "If we don't do that, we've
got to retool it, re-fix it and do
whatever we have to do because
we're going to do that for Michi-
gan."
Hoke was brought to Michi-
gan to do what his predecessor
Rich Rodriguez couldn't do -
compete in the conference.
Rodriguez's Wolverines were
6-18 in Big Ten play, finishing no
better than seventh in the con-
ference.
Hoke has made it clear that
Michigan is his destination job.
He wants to retire in Ann Arbor.
He's known that since former
coach Gary Moeller hired him as
a defensive line coach in Febru-
ary 1995.
But at a place like Michigan,
job security comes only after his
teams prove they can contend in
the Big Ten.
Unbeaten through four games
is nothing for Hoke and his play-
ers - they have Big Ten on their
minds.
"Everyone who is on this
team has been 4-0 at one point,
and everybody realizes that
doesn't mean anything once you
get into the Big Ten schedule,"
Van Bergen said. "Coach Hoke
says championships are won in
November, and our November
record's not very good.
"What we do in the next two
months is what's going to be
remembered of our team - for-
ever - and that's all we have left
as seniors."

Daily Sports Editor
By the end of Saturday's
game, the Michigan football
team may want to put the Little
Brown Jug in at linebacker. The
game should already be in hand,
and it would be nice gesture,
giving Minnesota a glimpse of
the trophy before it stays in Ann
Arbor for another year.
It certainly looks like a Mich-
igan loss in the Big Ten opener
would be a huge upset. Here's
what to look for this weekend.
Michigan pass offense vs.
Minnesota pass defense
It's the bad versus the really
bad. Which unit is which is yet
to be determined. Junior quar-
terback Denard Robinson has
yet to find himself in the pass-
inggame, throwing for less than
100 yards the past two weeks,
and the Gophers have a couple
of players who can make him
pay for his mistakes.
Minnesota defensive back
Kim Royston is a hometown kid
who leads the secondary and
also leads the team in tackles.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
singled him out this week as
someone who stood out on film.
North Dakota State came up just
short of 200 yards passing last
week against the Gophers.
But Minnesota ranks 108th
in the country in pass defense.
One of its starting cornerbacks,
Troy Stoudermire won't play
because of a fractured left wrist.
The defensive line won't help its
banged up secondary either, as
the Gophers' biggest problem
on defense has been generating
a pass rush. In four games, the
Gophers have just one sack this
season. If Michigan wants to get
its passing game on track, Rob-
inson will have the time to do so,
and Michigan's receivers should
be able to find open space.
Edge: Michigan
Michigan rush offense vs.
Minnesota rush defense
The Wolverines employ a
running back by committee for
the foreseeable future. In Big
Ten play, Robinson won't have
quite the speed advantage that
hee did in the non-conference
slate.
The Gophers' biggest
strength is their run defense.
Linebacker Gary Tinsley leads
a unit that ranks 33rd in the
country in rush defense. Minne-

sota hasn't given up more than
139 yards rushing in a game and
has surrendered 100 yards just
twice this season. Robinson had
200 yards last week.
Minnesota may be able to
contain Michigan's stable of
backs and could even stop
Robinson's designed runs. But
Robinson leads the nation in
rushing yards per game - he'll
find a way to get it done.
Edge: Michigan
Minnesota pass offense vs.
Michigan pass defense
The Gophers have weapons
on the outside. Senior receiver
Da'Jon McKnight leads a group
that may pose problems for the
Michigan secondary. Unfortu-
nately for Minnesota, the unit
doesn't have anybody to get
them the ball.
MarQueis Gray leads the
Gophers' two-quarterback sys-
tem and, like Robinson, he's
probably more dangerous with
his legs than with his arm. After
switching from receiver at the'
beginning of the season, he's
completing barely 50 percent
of his passes. Plus, he's deal-
ing with a toe injury. That may
mean freshman Max Shortell
carries more of the load. Short-
ell's completing just 46 percent
of passes and while he is a more
natural thrower, he doesn't
appear ready for the Big House.
Michigan's defensive line
should be able to get pressure on
whoever plays, going up against
an inconsistent offensive line on
the other side. Fifth-year senior
cornerback Troy Woolfolk will
play after suffering an injury
in the San Diego State game,
and his backup, freshman Blake
Countess, proved he's a service-
able backup. With the added
depth, the Wolverines should
be able to shut down the Minne-
sota passing game.
Edge: Michigan
Minnesota rush offense vs.
Michigan rush defense
The defensive line is fresh
off arguably its best game of the
season, and the rush defense
looks solid after halting the
Heisman talk of San Diego State
running back Ronnie Hillman.
Currently the 86th rush defense
in the nation, the question is
whether the Wolverines can
perform consistently against
Big Ten opponents.
The Golden Gophers can rush
the ball. Both running backs,

Duane Bennett and Donnell
Kirkwood, are relatively small
at 5-foot-9 and 5-foot-10 respec-
tively, but they both weigh more
than 200 pounds. If Gray plays
significantly, he'll be one of
three rushers Michigan will see.
Like Michigan, the Gophers'
quarterback leads the way on
the ground, more than doubling
the closest rusher's total on the
team.
No Gray means Michigan
holds a significant edge; a hob-
bled Gray gives it just a slight
advantage.
Edge: Michigan
Special Teams
Although freshman Matt
Wile has been serviceable at
punter, sophomore Will Hag-
erup's return from suspension
signals a significant upgrade. He
struggled early as a freshman
but settled down throughout
the year and started booming
punts, including one 72 yarder
against Purdue.
In Hagerup's career, he's
averaged 43.6 yards per punt.
Gophers punter Dan Orseske is
averaging 45.9 this season. With
those two canceling each other
out, the special teams battle
mainly comes down to the kick-
ers.
Neither kicker is very good,
but while Minnesota kicker
Chris Hawthorne has is just
5-for-8 this season with long of
36 yards, redshirt sophomore
Brendan Gibbons did little to
instill confidence in Wolverines
fans, missing a 40-yard field
goal last week. Until he starts
making field goals consistently,
Michigan loses this matchup,
even with Minnesota's top kick
returner, Stoudermire, out with
an injury.
Edge: Minnesota
Intangibles
Both teams should be fired up
for Big Ten play, except it can be
argued that this is just another
game for Michigan. Minnesota
is playing for its head coach,
Jerry Kill, who began the week
in the hospital receiving treat-
ment for a condition that gave
him seizures.
The Gophers also lost to
North Dakota State last week.
Beating a ranked team would
bring back a smidgen of respect-
ability to the program.
Edge: Minnesota
Final Score: Michigan 42,
Minnesota, 17

In addition to kite building,

for both University students and

Marc Bradshaw and his son
Parker, both Ann Arbor resi-
dents, entered the competition
with a pair of kites constructed
from Dupont Tyvek housewrap.
Bradshaw said he'd been con-
structing kites since he was aboy,
and that he was now teaching his
son the craft.
"I fell in love with flyingthings

said. "Now I'm just passing that

A small Chinese girl picks up
the dragonfly kite and a parent
tells her to put it down, but she
keeps it in her hantd. Master Ha
holds the line on the other end,
smiling at the little girl. He points
toward the sky.
"On the count of three?" he
asks in Chinese. They count to
three and the kite lifts into the air.
The little girl smiles, and so
does the master. Knowledge of
Chinese isn't required to under-
stand their smiles.

For the Daily
There's no denying there's
a certain charm to "Dolphin
Tale," an unmistakable appeal
that truly can
draw in the
entire family.*
Although it's Dolphin Tale
difficult to pin-
point the exact At Qualityl6
source of its and Rave
allure, it might
have some- Wamer Bros.
thing to do
with the fact that the film doesn't
blatantly infantilize its audience.
Even though the humor only gets
as original as it does in any other
family drama, at least it isn't
strung together by an endless
chain of bathroom jokes.
Based on a true story, the plot
revolves around the tale of a
young bottlenose dolphin named
Winter that learns how to swim
despite having her tail amputat-
ed. In order to give this amazing
story more of a feature film feel-
ing, the writers (Karen Janszen
and Naomi Dromi, "A Walk to
Remember" and "Sleeping with a
Bear," respectively) incorporate
Sawyer Nelson (Nathan Gamble,
"Marley & Me"), an introvert and
outcast who helps rescue Win-
ter and eventually develops a

close bond with her. Also in the
mix are Dr. Clay Haskett (Harry
Connick Jr., "P.S. I Love You"),
the veterinarian looking after
Winter, and Dr. McCarthy (Mor-
gan Freeman, "Million Dollar
Baby"), the engineer who designs
her prosthetic tail.
While these characters bring
an interesting new dimension
to the dolphin's story, we end up
seeing unrelated plotlines that
never really complement the
central narrative. And it's a pity
this happens because many of

the themes in Winter's story are
much more than the usual harp-
ing about how industrialization
is evil and harms our environ-
ment. The plot points about the 4
constant threat of debt faced by
non-profit animal hospitals and
the lack of government fund-
ing they now receive are rarely
touched upon in other films and
add originality to this one.
What doesn't add originality
is the dialogue, which is bor-

stereotypical. It doesn't help that
the acting is at most times forced
and unexciting. Gamble plays
Sawyer with polarizing bursts
of emotion, sometimes chang-
ing pace from reserved and sul-
len to talkative within a matter
of seconds. This is supposed to
show a developing change in
Sawyer's personality but instead
feels unnatural and makes it dif-
ficult for the audience to connect.
Academy Award winner Free-
man is given too little time on the
screen to really have an impacton
the audience, and his personal-
ity ends up getting sidelined like

many of the smaller story lines in
the script.
The final result is a weird
movie that shines at various
points but eventually looks dull
and unimpressive. The real prob-
lem is that the movie tries too
hard to be entertaining, taking
away from the astonishing true
story of Winter. Rather than rely-
ing upon what really happened,
the writers and director give us
too much perspective from char-
acters that haven't really been
properly fleshed out and don't
really exist. Even though this
film is a noticeable step up from
the dreck we see every day in the
family drama genre, it underper-
forms and becomes another for-
gettable movie.

while it may fall short of its hope-

Blink-182 diehards will find it a
welcome effort.
Even though the band fails to
achieve its lofty ambition of recap-
turing its once-timeless sound, the
musicians' separate skills are still
improving. Travis Barker, already

drummers of the modern era, con-

real triumph here is that the two
manage to share the main vocals
relatively equally, despite their
feud being the causal aspect of the
band's breakup. It's strange to say,
but there is potential for even more
success from this previous punk
juggernaut.
For many fans, Neighborhoods
is a response to previously unan-
swered prayers. It has enough
hooks and charm to satisfy the
loyal legion of devotees, and there's
no doubt that the trio still has some
semblance of chemistry. The fun-
damentalflawistheresimplyaren't
any standout hits ready to take the
radio waves by storm, and for that,
the listener will have to remain
hopeful for one more release.

After a long and relatively boring non-conference schedule,
we've finally arrived at the glory that is Big Ten play, where we
hear they play smash-mouth football. Luckily for Michigan, Min-
nesota isn't really a Big Ten team. It's barely a Division-I team.
The Gophers are coming off a loss against the mighty Bison of
North Dakota State. The Wolverines are coming off arguably
their best performance of the year. Are you on Devin Gardner
watch yet? You should be. This could be the last time he has a
chance to see the field, barring a Denard Robinson injury.

2011 Schedule

Western Michigan (Sept. 3): Good thing the
rain came. And the blitzes, too. Looked like Greg
Robinson was coaching until the second quarter.
Notre Dame (Sept. 10): Nothing to see here.
Michigan rallied with a 28-point fourth quarter
to stun the Fighting Irish and get the victory.
Eastern Michigan (Sept. 17): After struggling
early, Michigan relied on the legs of Denard
Robinson and Vincent Smith for the 31-3 win.
San Diego State (Sept. 24): Denard Robinson's
200 yards rushing outshone his lousy day pass-
ing, while Michigan bullied the Aztecs up front.
Minnesota (Oct.1): MarQueis Gray played wide
receiver last year - now he's the quarterback
and the only thing exciting about the Gophers.
Northwestern (Oct. 8): Dan Persa - that's
about it.

Michigan State (Oct. 15): Edwin Baker and

year, and Kirk Cousins ain't too shabby either.

doing good. Her and my mom are very close."
He had also made enough moneyto put aside for Eugene's
college fund.
With his family ina secure situation, Marell Evans real-
ized he had some unfinished business of his own.
It was the middle of January in 2011, and the Michigan
football roster was set.
But when Marell contacted the Michigan coaching staff,
new head coach Brady Hoke and defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison gave him a glimmer of hope.
"First of all, Coach Mattison was the biggest reason I
wanted to come back," Marell said. "He's the guy who gave
me a chance. He told me if you mess up, you're outta here -
simple as that. One chance."
If he got in as a student, Hoke said they might be able to
offer him a spot as a walk-on.
He applied, and his credits from Hampton transferred.
He was reinstated to the University.
But when Marell arrived in Ann Arbor, he had to take care
of a few other things before he could worry about football.
"When I first got here in January, I worked delivery
routes in Bloomfield Hills delivering the newspaper," he
said. "Financially, I was helping myself with school."
He was no longer at home, but his priorities remained the
same: family first. Then school. Then football.
And in late January, Marell got the chance to meet Hoke
in person.
"He said he's maybe got a spot for me," Marell recalled. "I
prayed every day."
The next day, his phone rang. A year and a half after his
departure from Ann Arbor, Marell Evans was a Michigan
football player again.
When Marell talks about his return, it seems like even he
still can't believe it. He shakes his head, his eyelids drop. He
looks up to the sky, and his voice drops.
"I'm blessed," he says. "I'm blessed to be here."
Chilcoat was one of the first to contact him when the
news came out.
"I sent him a message right away to tell him how proud

of him I was and how great that newswas," Chilcoat said. "I
just think it's a great opportunity for him, whether he plays
another down or not, to just get his diploma from Michigan.
That would just open so many doors for him."
Wide receiver Roy Roundtree, a good friend of Marell in
2008, didn't believe it when he heard his buddy was back.
"When he told me he was coming back, I thought it was
a joke," Roundtree said. "But when I saw him come out and
work out with us, I was like, 'OK, I'm happy now."'
Marell jumped right into team workouts, and at the
spring game this season he emerged as a front-runner for
the starting linebacker position.
By the end of the spring, he had earned a full-ride schol-
arship. He changed his number from 9 to 51 - a symbol of
his new beginning.
"I had No. 9 my whole life," he said. "To change to this
number is just different."
He continued competing for the starting job throughout
the fall. In the week before the season opener against West-
ern Michigan, Marell was listed third on the depth chart.
He wouldn't be starting, but that was alright.
"I'm just going to help this team whatever way I can,"
Marell said in August. "From starter to special teams, what-
ever Coach Hoke and his staff want me to play."
But on game day, he wasn't dressed.
All the media heard before the Western Michigan game
was that Marell was "ineligible to play."
A Michigan spokesman referenced transfer issues - the
NCAA deemed Marell ineligible because of complications
with his transfer status. Both the NCAA and Michigan
thought he would be able to play. But not long before kickoff
against the Broncos, the news broke.
A clear answer has yet to be given as to why. Apparently,
Marell did everything he was supposed to and an NCAA
transfer rule has yet to be resolved. It could be fixed at any
point during the season, and Marell could resume playing.
But for now, he remains on the team and a member of the
scout team in practice.
For Marell, who per NCAA rules is not permitted to
comment on anything about his eligibility now, it's another
bump in his long journey back to Ann Arbor.
His former coaches can't help but to be bothered by the
news.
When Hayden talks about it, you can't
miss the disappointment in his voice. It
trembles almost, as he tries his best to sup-
press his anger. Zac Hayden understands
Marell Evans. He knows what he's been
through.
It's hard to see him hit yet another road-
block. He talks to me over the phone, but I
can almost feel him shaking his head.
"It bothers me, man, that he can't be
on the doggone field," Hayden says. "You
got all these prima donna guys, they want
everything handed to them. They want
money. They sell their bowl rings, they sell
their gear and they autograph stuff to make
money.
"Marell Evans is out here busting his tail
doing what he needs to do, and all the sud-
den he gets told last minute he's ineligible.
And there's other people at his archrival
Ohio State selling stuff, and now they're in
MARELL EvANs the NFL."
le for the He apologizes for going on a tangent; I tell
r job. him there's no need.

"Marell Evans is what college football is all about," he
continues. "Getting an opportunity to do something he's
wanted to do his whole life, and working his ass off. And
then you got these other people, these prima donnas, that
make college football look bad."
After a few more exchanges, I thank him for talking to
me. He pauses.
"Tell him Coach Hayden wants the best for him, will ya?"
Marell has yet to be on a 2011 game day roster.
But at 22, he's the oldest player on the team. His experi-
ence and leadership have paid dividends forthe Wolverines.
"I don't know when (his eligibility issues) will clear up,"
Hoke said on Sept. 12. "But he's doing a great job being the
best scout team linebacker in the country."
Hayden wasn't surprised to hear that Hoke was singing
Marell's praise.
"If he can't play and he's on the scout team, he's goingto
go as hard as he can in practice," Hayden said. "He's going to
make everybody around him better. That's just the way he
is. He's a great kid."
His presence is felt in the locker room, too.
Roundtree was one of many who noticed a difference.
"When I first got here, Marell took me in to show me
around Michigan," Roundtree said. "I consider him a big
brother to me. He's funny and competitive. He's always got
that mindset of getting better. On Saturdays, he'll come in
here and do extra work, and he's just got a passion for the
game."
Junior quarterback Denard Robinson echoed Roundtree's
sentiments.
"When I firstcame in I met Marell, and he was one of the
guys I looked up to as a leader and a big brother," Robinson
said. "He's a great guy, and I enjoy being around him and the
things he does and the things he brings out in you.
"He's been through alot, and he helps me with any prob-
lems I have."
Marell Evans was given a second chance to finish what
he started. So far, it hasn't quite gone to script.
But then again for him, not many things have.
"I think going through this, he realized he's matured,"
Hayden said. "Even if he never plays a down of football, he's
going to be a better kid because he's had to deal with this."
Marell is still on track to graduate in December with
a degree in General Studies. Although playing football
helped him attain a college education, a degree can take
him to places that no one in his family had ever dreamed of.
"I want do something with psychology," Marell said.
"The window is open for opportunities. I try to meet as
many people as I can at the University of Michigan, and I
greet everybody like it's the last person I'll see.
"My mom and grandma are two people I'm trying to
make proud. They are definitely my inspiration, 100 per-
cent."
He was a Michigan football player. Then he wasn't. Now
he is again. And because of it, he's learned more than he
ever would have if things had gone as planned.
"Just be blessed," he says. "It's as simple as that. Just
understand that everything you've got could be gone in one
day. It's just a great opportunity to be here right now. It's a
blessing.
"I could be working right now at a warehouse in Rich-
mond, Virginia."
Even on the sidelines, Marell Evans is taking nothing for
granted.

To stop Gray, Hoke says, 'Chase the rabbit'

Coach Chilcoat, is to be a father figure to these young men.
Be a character guy. Teach them how to do things the right
way.
"Be the stability in the storm when they've got things
going on and they need help."
Hayden was the stability, and oftentimes, Chilcoat
brought the storm.
"I was the hard-ass on the staff because I'm an older
person," the 61-year old Chilcoat said. "They looked to the
younger assistants for guidance ... people who could under-
stand their situation better than I could."
Varina's football program was unlike most high school
programs.
"We really demanded a lot from them," Chilcoat said.
"From grades to participating in an offseason program to
summer programs to fundraising, we really did alot."
By his senior year, Marell was a team captain. At the end
of the season, he was named first-team All-State and was the
Richmond Times-Dispatch Defensive Player of the Year. He
was also an All-District basketball player.
The kid without a father became a big brother to the
underclassmen.
"Marell was a full-front leader," Chilcoat said. "He
stepped up, just did whatever we asked of him."
It wasn't always a smooth ride - but that was part of what
made Marell special.
"He had some bumps along the way, butthey were always
ironed out pretty easily," Chilcoat said. "You just have to
like those kids that pull themselves up when you don't have
much at home and don't have much of yourself, and to get
out of situations that he's been in on his own has been pretty
remarkable.
"I just really love that trait in him."
That trait was one of many that helped push Marell to do
anything he could to accomplish something no one in his
family had ever done.
"It was important to him to get a scholarship and to have
an opportunity to play at the college level," Hayden said.
"He did whatever he needed to do to do that. He'd watch
film with me. He would always finish every drill harder than
he started. He'd study hard. He'd do the things he'd need
to do in class. He improved all his grades through his high
school career."
Not only did he graduate - he was academically eligible
to accept a scholarship to one of the best academic schools
in the nation.
It was August 2009, and Marell Evans had just announced
his decision to leave Michigan.
The soon-to-be-junior linebackerthad started just one
game in his short two-year career - the 2008 season-open-
er against Utah.
He recorded four tackles and a half sack in that game, a
25-23 loss, but was burned deep several times.
"It was fast," Marell recalled in an interview with
MGoBlue.com on August 25."I didn't do too good in that
game. I made a couple tackles, but I didn't play to my poten-
tial:"
Just as quickly as he earned the starting job, he lost it.
He played almostcexclusively on special teams for the rest
of theyearunderheadcoach RichRodriguez. Soon after the
season ended - a season in which the Wolverines went 3-9
in Rodriguez's first year at the helm - Marell was gone.
Most figured it was because he wanted more playing
time. Others speculated he didn't like Rodriguez's system -
Marell was recruited by former Michigan coach Lloyd Carr
and had played for Carr his freshman year. And there may
be some truth to both notions.

But even Rodriguez
wasn't completely sure of
the reason for the trans-
fer.
"Good, young men,"
Rodriguez said of Marell
and defensive tackle.
Vince Helmuth, whoT
transferred around the
same time as Evans.
"Sometimes that hap-
pens. Guys think, 'Maybe
I'm not getting a lot of
reps, I'm not on the depth
chart.' I try to remind the
guys that the depth chart P
is not going to be solid
until the first week (of
games.)"
Marell didn't put the
blame on Rodriguez, like
most other transfers that
year did. He never quite
gave a reason for his
transfer but always hinted
that there was somethingR
other than just football on
the line. Not long before the season opene
"Me and Coach Rod are was told he was ruled ineligible be
on good terms," he told
the Detroit Free Press on August12, 2009. "It was more than
playingtime or academics or anything like that. It was a lot
of things. Coach Rod is a great coach and Iwish him plenty
of success. I wanted to finish my career in a different way."
Originally, few people understood.
"The coaches didn't understand, but I have to do what's
best for my future," he told the Free Press.
But it really wasn't just about his future.
While Marell was in Ann Arbor living out his dream of
playing college football, his mother, Valerie, and 16 year-old
half-brother, Eugene, remained home in Richmond.
Financially, Valerie often had troubles making ends meet.
And in Michigan, there was little Marell could do to help.
With his vigorous class and football schedule, he didn't have
time for a job.
Something had to change.
"I was thinking family before anything," he said. "I got a
brother who is on the right track, just making sure he's OK,
before I do anything about football. I was very focused on
helping my mother."
Marellrand Eugene share the same mother. Eugene lost
his father when he was young, too. Marell didn't want
Eugene to have to grow up without a father, like he did.
So he didn't let him.
"I was a father figure to him," Marell said. "When things
go wrong in my life, I feel like I let him down. I do every-
thingsI can to show him the rightsway, sodsI want to help pay
for his college. That's my goal."
He couldn't do that from Ann Arbor.
Once he left the team, Marell spent the next five months
at home with his family trying to figure out what his next
move would be. He picked up a job at a nearby warehouse,
working eight-hour days.
"It was very humbling," he said. "Understanding what I
had (at Michigan) and anywhere I could be, it's as humbling
as it could get."
During the 2010 winter semester, Marell decided to

me to a FCS opponent and centerpiece of the offense. Still,

Gray hasn't lit the world onfire with
his passingnumbers early on. In the
season opener against USC, Gray
couldn't exceed the 100-yard pass-
ing mark in three quarters before
he left the game due to cramps.
Freshman quarterback Max Short-
ell entered the game and nearly
orchestrated an upset over the Tro-
jans. A week ago in Minnesota's loss
to North Dakota State, both Short-
ell, the pocket. passer, and Gray
rotated and the Golden Gophers
threw for just 124 yards.
So what's Kill to do? Perhaps fol-
low Michigan's formula and rely on
the legs of your dynamic quarter-
back: Gray's 351 rushing yards are
40th bestlin the country and fourth-
best among quarterbacks. Already
this season, Mattison's defense has
had trouble maintaining running
lanes for quarterbacks and late-
developing running plays. On mul-
tiple occasions, Western Michigan's
Alex Carder found a hole in the
Wolverines' containment.
"We can't allow those kinds of
runs," Mattison said. "But at the
same time you can't sit back either.
We can't play a defense of what-ifs.
We want to be the attacker, and

then some of those things we can
tweak and we can help ourselves to
make sure that doesn't happen."
Mattison's playerss have experi-
enced most of their success this sea-
son when dialing up blitzes at the
right time, forcing key turnovers
- a whole 13 of them in four games
- because they are the aggressor,
and they don't sit back. At first, his
defensive line couldn't generate
enough pressure by itself. But in the
past two games, junior defensive
end Craig Roh - Mattison's rush
end - has recorded three tackles
for losses, including two sacks and
a forced fumble. Defensive tackles
Mike Martin and Ryan Van Bergen
have also worked well - Martin
disrupting the pocket, and Van Ber-
gen taking on double teams to free
up Roh and Martin. Those three, as
well as a handful of other linemen
rotating in, will have to maintain
their gaps while rushing Gray, Mat-
tison said. Because if Roh or Martin
or Van Bergen leave a void, Gray
can sprint right through it. In the
first four games, Mattison's defense
has been caught not playing every
gap tight and teams have burned
the defense on it, especially when

enroll at Hampton University - a small Division-I school
about an hour away from his hometown.
Leaving Ann Arbor was a difficult decision - and to Chil-
coat, it was a mistake.
"I don't think he got all the right people talking to him,
or he just didn't listen to them," Chilcoat said. "But he knew
when he got home that he had made a big mistake. I saw him
that Christmas I think. He was getting ready to go to Hamp-
ton, but you could tell he was just sick (that he was) not get-
ting readyto go back to Michigan."
And it truly may have been a mistake at the time. There's
no telling what could have happened if he stayed at Michi-
gan.
But the decision had been made. Marell was determined
to go to school somewhere, regardless of whether football
was in the equation.
"Academics was something I wanted to do because I am
the first person to graduate high school in my family," he
said."So coming to college is a bigger thing. It's a blessing,
a privilege."
When he enrolled at Hampton, he originally planned on
playing football there too, but a nagging injury sidelined
him well before the season started. Hampton coach Dono-
van Rose said he never really got a chance to know Marell,
but said he was "respectful" the few times he was able to
talk to him.
In a matter of a couple months, Marell Evans hadagone
from a Michigan linebacker to a Hampton student and a
warehouse employee.
His job used to be to play his favorite sport in front of
almost 110,000 people at Michigan Stadium. Now, his job

Marell attended Hampton for two semesters. He earned
enough credits so that he would onlyneed a couplemore
semesters to graduate.
And by the end of his tenure there, he had achieved one
of his many goals.

Mattison sends extra defenders on
"overload" blitzes from either side.
With Gray, Mattison won't stop
sending extra defenders to get after
him, he'll just make sure they know
to take the right angles, leaving lit-
tle space to improvise.
"That's where this kind of quar-
terback makes it harder on you,"
Mattison said. "If a guy's not
mobile, then you just say, 'Go get
him. We'll run him down.' This guy
here's like Denard in a way where,
all of a sudden, ifa guy rushes too
high up the field he's going to break
it up the inside."
But just how fast is Gray?
At Big Ten Media days in August,
Gray made a comparison:
"I can say I'm nowhere as fast as
Shoelace," he said. "But I've got a
good amount of speed to me."
But he may be a bit hobbled. A
foot injury kept Gray from practic-
ing early in the week, and his status
was still uncertain as of Thursday
evening. Michigan coach Brady
Hoke wouldn't tell his linemen to
play Gray any differently than any
other quarterback.
As Hoke said, they just have to,

players I've ever coached," Hayden said.
Considering who he's coached, that's no small
statement. In Marell's senior year, Varina sent
nine players to Division-I schools. Former Michi-
gan running back Brandon Minor graduated from
Varina in 2006 - a year before Marell.
Since 1995, the Blue Devils have won eight
regional championships and "14 or 15 district
championships," according to Gary Chilcoat, the
Varina head coach for nine of those years.
But for Marell, his talent meant nothing if he
didn't have the guidance to help use it in the best
way possible. If he was going to make it to the next
level, he couldn't do it alone.
He lost his father to drugs when he was six. No
one'in his family had graduated high school, let
alone college. He needed people at school to push
him, tolet him know that he could do it.
That's exactly what Hayden and Chilcoat did.
Hayden, who was still only a few years out of
college during Marell's tenure at Varina, was
- more than just a coach.
"Man, we were real close," Hayden said. "The
