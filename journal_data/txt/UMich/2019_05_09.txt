Commencement speakers 
reflect on time at ‘U’,
future ambitions

Community,
guests celebrate at 
Michigan Stadium 
on Saturday

Students, 
parents, 
faculty 
and 
guests 
filled 
Michigan 
Stadium 
Saturday 
morning 
for the annual University of 
Michigan 
Commencement 
ceremony. The event celebrated 
graduating students and featured 
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer as the 
commencement speaker.
LSA Interim Dean Elizabeth 
Cole said in her speech that 
graduates have abilities which are 
not yet known to them but should 
not be afraid to utilize them when 
the time comes. As an alum herself, 
Cole said she understands how 
attending the University prepares 
students for the world and is 
inspired by its history of student 

activism.
“My wish for you, the class of 
2019, is to recognize your power,” 
Cole said. “You have everything 
you need to face the challenges of 
your time.”
LSA senior Avi Sholkoff, one 
of four student speakers, said he 
first came to campus unsure if he 
would fit in and if Ann Arbor was 
right for him. However, he found 
communities, and said he leaves the 
University knowing it was for him.
Sholkoff focused his speech 
around destigmatizing the mental 
health problems that can come 
with college life. He said these 
issues are often not talked about, 
but he wanted attendees to know 
it is a real issue and to recognize 
the importance of mental health 
awareness.
“Michigan became the first place 
where I realized feelings of anxiety 
and loneliness are truly OK,” 
Sholkoff said. “To anyone hearing 
this: know that you are not alone 
and you matter.”
Engineering 
senior 
Bassal 
Salka shared his experience at 
the University as a Muslim. He 

discussed the people he met as 
well as his own involvement at the 
University.
“When we reflect on our time at 
U-M, we think of skills learned or 
goals achieved,” Salka said. “These 
successes tell only half the story. 
Equally important are the variety of 
experiences and resulting emotions 
that have built our character, 
shaped our ambitions and produced 
lifelong friendships.”

Public 
Policy 
senior 
Yvonne 

Navarrete said the lessons she has 

learned through her parents, her 

Detroit community and her time 

at the University have helped her 

confront fear with courage. Navarrete 

founded La Casa, a Latinx student 

organization, at the University with 

other student leaders. 
“I was uncertain and afraid 
when I first applied to this 
prestigious 
University 
as 
an 
undocumented student,” Navarrete 
said. “I didn’t know if I would be 
accepted, wanted or able to afford 
the ‘Michigan Difference.’”

Local school 
grapples with 
accusations of 
sexual assault

Community High 
students talk complaints 
of mishandled cases, 
Title IX investigation

On the morning of April 25, Jenny 
Hannibal, parent of a Community High 
School student, filed a Title IX complaint 
to the Office of Civil Rights, alleging Ann 
Arbor Public Schools mishandled at least a 
dozen cases of sexual misconduct, including 
a rape on campus by an expelled student. 
Hannibal later withdrew her statement 
due to factual inaccuracies but plans to 
re-file a revised version. A previously 
scheduled parent meeting at Community 
High 
School 
conducted 
by 
AAPS 
Superintendent Jeanice Swift commenced 
just 20 minutes after the withdrawl of the 
statement.
In the initial complaint, Hannibal 
claimed 
Community 
High 
School 
regularly failed to properly file Title IX 
documentation 
forms. 
The 
complaint 
also accused the school of neglecting to 
notify the police in multiple cases of sexual 
assault and the victim’s parents in at least 
one incident of sexual assault. Hannibal 
mentioned Michigan’s mandated reporting 
laws, which require mandatory reporters, 
such as school administrators and teachers, 
to disclose suspected child abuse and 
neglect to the police. 
In addition, the complaint alleged that 
Community High School Dean, Marci 
Tuzinsky, discouraged staff members 
from reporting alleged assaults and even 
threatened to transfer a teacher who 
attempted to notify Paul DeAngelis, AAPS 
executive director of high school education 
and Title IX coordinator.

City Council talks 
oversight, Superfund

Council reviews 
commission makeup, 
EPA collaboration

The Ann Arbor City Council 
discussed 
involving 
the 
Environmental Protection Agency 
in cleaning up the Gelman dioxane 
plume as well as altering the makeup 
of the Independent Community 
Police Oversight Commission at a 
meeting on Monday.
City Council moved to replace 
Councilmember 
Zachary 
Ackerman, 
D-Ward 
3, 
with 
Councilmember 
Ali 
Ramlawi, 
D-Ward 5, as one of the body’s 
two liaisons to the ICPOC. Calls 
for a police oversight commission 
became more prominent following 
the 2014 shooting death of resident 
Aura Rosser at the hands of Ann 
Arbor police officers, and City 
Council adopted an ordinance in 
October establishing the ICPOC 
after 
months 
of 
debate 
and 
controversy.

Ramlawi, who is one of City 
Council’s liaisons to the Human 
Rights 
Commission, 
said 
the 
success of the commission was 
important to him.
“I felt that in the current state 
of affairs, it would strengthen the 
commission and also would tie the 
two commissions in our city — the 
Human Rights Commission and 
the Police Oversight Commission 
— in a way that would allow for 
more communication between the 
transition and for the newly formed 
body to do its work,” Ramlawi said.
Ramlawi noted an argument 
made by a resident during public 
comment that he would be better 
suited to sit on the ICPOC than 
Ackerman, who is white.
“This is a great personal interest 
of mine,” Ramlawi said. “I was 
referred to as a person of color 
earlier. It is true, I identify with 
being a minority, being Palestinian, 
but born and raised in this country, 
I do have a great empathy for people 
who get the raw end of the stick.”

‘U’ president 
reflects on school 
year, looks ahead

Each month, The Michigan Daily 
sits down with University President 
Mark Schlissel to discuss events 
and issues on campus. During this 
month’s interview, Schlissel touched 
on topics related to minority inclusion 
on campus, emergency preparedness, 
One University, carbon neutrality 
efforts and future goals.
The Michigan Daily: 
The 
development of the new Trotter 
Center on State Street was one of 
seven demands listed by #BBUM 
in 2013. While many students 
voiced their appreciation for the 
center, there was also criticism for 
the lack of fulfillment in regards 
to the other demands. In addition 
to BSU’s requests, La Casa also 
released a list of demands for 
the University in terms of hiring 
practices, spaces and more. What 
does the fact that certain student 
groups need to release demands 
to the University say about the 
overall campus climate? How does 
the University plan to continue 
meeting the needs of marginalized 
communities? Are any of the other 
demands from either BSU or La 
Casa being addressed? If so, how?
Mark Schlissel: I think the 

advocacy by student groups like 
BBUM, like La Casa is really 
important for the University. It 
helps us understand better how 
all different types of students are 
experiencing the campus. It helps 
us identify students that we can try 
to work together with to figure out 
the best way forward, and I think 
the new Trotter is a great example 
of that. So, students from BBUM, 
but also from many other groups, 
were part of discussions that led 
to the design of what turned out 
to be an absolutely spectacular 
project …. The BBUM demands 
preceded my arrival on campus 
but provoked what continue to 
be ongoing discussions between 
representatives of my office, the 
Vice President for Student Life 
Royster Harper, the Dean of the 
college Laura Blake Jones and 
others about how best to serve all 
different types of students on the 
campus.
Demands 
are 
particularly 
difficult; it’s not really an opening 
for discussion, it’s a demand. I 
think where things work the best 
is where students who feel strongly 
about things express their strength 
of feelings, then — as in the case 
of Trotter — are willing to work 
together to actualize a solution. 
We don’t have the capacity to 
do everything that every group 
demands of us, but we do have the 
capacity to meet with every group 
on an ongoing basis.

Andrew Yang, entrepre-
neur and 2020 presidential 
candidate, hosted a campaign 
rally Saturday evening at the 
Detroit Shipping Company 
food hall in the Cass Corri-
dor neighborhood of Detroit. 
About 300 people attended 

the rally to hear Yang’s policy 
ideas and strategy for winning 
the Democratic nomination.
Yang is one of more than 
20 democrats running for the 
nomination, which includes 
Former Vice President Joe 
Biden; Sen. Kamala Harris, 
D-Calif.; Mayor Pete But-
tigieg; Sen. Bernie Sanders, 
D-Vt. and many more.
Detroit 
resident 
Nicho-
las Scott told The Daily prior 
to the event Yang is his first 
choice in this election cycle.
“He’s the only candidate 
with a lot of policy positions 
I absolutely agree with and 
even some policy positions I 
don’t even know about, and 
I hear him talk about (them) 
and I think ‘Of course,’” Scott 
said. “The other day, I saw his 
appearance on something and 
they asked him about pennies 
and how he wants to get rid of 
the penny because it’s bad for 
the environment and worth-
less. I never thought about the 
penny and I thought ‘Jesus, we 
need to make this man presi-
dent.’”

Scott said climate change is 
always his primary concern, 
but Yang’s policy proposal 
of Universal Basic Income, 
which would give Americans 
over the age of 18 years old 
$1,000 per month, has become 
an important policy idea for 
him.
“Climate change is num-
ber one, always,” Scott said. 

“After that, maybe UBI. UBI 
fixes so much about welfare, 
and it’s politically popular on 
both sides of the aisle which is 
incredible for a welfare safety 
net program.”
Paul Bartlett, founder of 
Yang’s Metro Detroit cam-
paign office, introduced Yang 
to the crowd. He got involved 
with Yang’s campaign after 
listening to a podcast Yang 
was featured on. He said he 
was amazed by the number 
of policy ideas he found on 
Yang’s website.
“When I first saw him, he 
had 70 policies on his cam-
paign page,” Bartlett said. “By 
the time I looked around, he 
had 75. He now has over 100 
policies on that page.”
Yang was then introduced 
onto the stage. Yang said he 
has been visiting Detroit each 
year for the past eight years 
and is astonished with the 
revitalization Detroit is expe-
riencing.
“I came here in 2010 or 2011 
when the bankruptcy was just 
on, and the city has just got-

ten better and better and more 
and more vibrant thanks to 
people exactly like you,” Yang 
said.
Yang began by stating he is 
not a career politician, but an 
entrepreneur and a problem 
solver. He said he wants to 
solve what he thinks the prob-
lem is regarding the election 
of President Donald Trump.
“The real answer is Donald 
Trump is our president today 
because we automated away 
four million manufacturing 
jobs in Michigan, Ohio, Penn-
sylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri 
and Iowa,” Yang said. “If all 
of those states sound familiar, 
those are all the states that 
Donald Trump needed to win 
and did win.”
Yang 
said 
he 
believes 
Trump’s message was par-
ticularly resonant with people 
who lost their jobs due to auto-
mation, and that’s why Trump 
was successful in those states. 
Trump 
said 
automation 
hit Detroit especially hard 
because of its heavy manufac-
turing industry.
“This town is very much 
the ground zero for the auto-
mation of jobs,” Yang said.
Yang credited some of this 
job loss to the expansion of 
Amazon and, he believes, for 
not paying their fair share in 
income tax.
“Amazon somehow paid 
less in taxes than each of you,” 
Yang said.
Yang went on to explain 
his idea of the Freedom Divi-
dend, which is Universal Basic 
Income of $1,000 per month to 
every American adult.
“The first time you heard 
that, I know what you thought,” 
Yang said. “I know you thought 
‘Haha, that’s a bit of a gimmick. 
There’s an Asian man running 
for president who wants to give 
everyone $1,000 a month.’ But 
if you dig into our history, you 
find that this Universal Basic 
Income has actually been a part 
of our country’s DNA from the 
very beginning.”

Presidential candidates stump in Detroit

Presidential 
candidate 
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., 
gave the keynote address to a 
crowd of 10,000 people at the 
64th annual NAACP Fight 
for Freedom Dinner at the 
Cobo Conference Center in 
Detroit Sunday evening. The 
Detroit branch of the NAACP 
is the largest in the nation.
Harris is one of over 
20 people running for the 
Democratic 
nomination. 
According to CNN, Former 
Vice President Joe Biden is 
currently leading election 
opinion polls, while Harris 
is polling at 5 percent. Before 
being elected to the U.S. Con-
gress, Harris served as the 
Attorney General of Califor-
nia and the District Attorney 
of San Francisco.
The NAACP hosted a press 
conference before the dinner 
began. At the press confer-
ence, President of the Detroit 
NAACP Rev. Dr. Wendell 
Anthony said the stakes are 
too high in the upcoming 
election to not participate.
“We must be counted … the 
stakes are too great to sit this 
out,” Anthony said. “What’s 
riding on the election is our 
lives, our freedom.”
Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., 
echoed 
these 
sentiments 
later in the evening. He also 
emphasized the importance 
of the Census as well as the 
2020 election, in which he 
will be running for re-elec-
tion.
“I will tell you there are 
some people in this country 
who don’t want you count-
ed,” Peters said. “They don’t 
want your voice heard.”
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 
said she will serve as a part-
ner to Michigan in providing 
more opportunities for col-
lege and work advancement. 
She said the NAACP is a bed-
rock in the state.
“The true infrastructure 
in our state that we need to 

address is the lack of oppor-
tunity,” Whitmer said. “You 
not only have a seat at the 
table, but you have a partner 
in me.”
After the press confer-
ence, U.S. Rep. Debbie Ding-
ell, D-Mich., said the NAACP 
has played a major role in 
fighting for equal rights in 
America.

“I’ve been coming to this 
dinner for a long time, and 
the NAACP has played a 
critical role for decades in 
fighting for civil rights and 
equal opportunity for all,” 
Dingell said. “I was really in 
the trenches when we fought 
for affirmative action at the 
University of Michigan. The 
people who are a part of this 
organization are good peo-
ple that I am proud to work 
with.”
Additional 
Michigan 
politicians 
in 
attendance 
included Michigan Attorney 
General Dana Nessel, U.S. 
Rep. Rashida Tlaib, Detroit 
Mayor Mike Duggan and 
Sen. Debbie Stabenow.
After the press conference, 
guests came together for din-
ner and remarks from win-
ners of various awards. Dr. 
Charles Adams, pastor of the 
Hartford Memorial Baptist 
Church, was given the James 
Weldon Johnson Lifetime 
Achievement Award. Musi-
cian and philanthropist Akon 
received the Freedom & Jus-

tice Award. Amanda Alex-
ander, executive director of 
the Detroit Justice Center, 
and Darryl Woods Sr., former 
prison branch president at 
Ryan Correctional Facility, 
were both given the Great 
Expectations Award.
Akon said African Ameri-
cans should attempt to adjust 
the way they view their own 

identities.
“There’s no reason to have 
an African American,” Akon 
said. “You’re just an African 
in America.”
Harris then began her key-
note address to the crowd. 
She began by saying Ameri-
ca’s political system needs to 
be reformed to better repre-
sent the everyday citizen.
“The system is in need of 
reform, so let’s have people on 
the inside prepared to use their 
power to open doors and pre-
pared to implement the agenda 
to make the system more fair 
and just,” Harris said. “That 
is what I have done from the 
first day I walked into the San 
Francisco 
(District 
Attor-
ney’s) office, from the first day 
I walked into the California 
(Attorney General’s) office, 
from the first day I walked 
into the U.S. Senate, and that 
is what I will do the first day I 
walk into the Oval Office.”

Community voices inspire action
S

ustainability has become 
an important topic on 
every level. There are 
large-scale patterns of pollution 
and damage to the Earth that will 
have lasting effects on genera-
tions to come unless adjustments 
are made. With these looming 
causes of climate change that are 
often created by powerful corpo-
rations or governmental policies, 
the sentiment that individuals 
have little power in what is hap-
pening to our planet can arise. 
I have heard people state that 
there first needs to be big sys-
tematic alterations to help the 
issue before they need to worry 
about their own carbon foot-
print. While it is definitely true 
that systematic dynamics need 
to be changed at wide-reaching 
levels, it is also important to 
include the individual’s journey 
towards being eco-friendly and 
conscious about what we put 
into the world.
Increased awareness of and 
education 
about 
sustainabile 
options in daily life can hopeful-
ly expand the demographics of 
eco-conscious people. At a local 
level, students at the University 
of Michigan have a wide array 
of resources for environmental 
education and action. Through 
Planet Blue, students can become 
ambassadors through a simple 
process of watching informa-
tive videos about distinguished 
categories such as energy, food, 
water and community.
If 
students 
utilized 
this 
opportunity, the amount of envi-
ronmentally aware people would 
rise substantially. As described 
in 
Planet 
Blue’s 
community 
training portion, it is benefi-
cial to raise the enthusiasm and 
accessibility of sustainable prac-
tices and events in order to get 
people involved. Many people, 
whether they be students or not, 
struggle with consistent engage-
ment in eco-friendly actions 
in the community due to busy 
schedules 
or 
inaccessibility. 
With the University, we must 
work to make it easier for the 
community to join eco-friendly 
programs and educate others on 
how to care for the environment.
These types of programs and 
access to education will allow 
for open conversations about 
sustainability in personal and 
academic life. Through raising 
our own voices to the leaders 

of our school, we can hopefully 
enact some change in the way 
the University deals with envi-
ronmental policies and deci-
sions. On March 15, our campus 
participated in the Global Cli-
mate Strike. A multitude of ages 
and voices came to support the 
cause. Open protests such as 
this are a way for any individ-
ual to express their support for 
what they believe is right for the 
future of our planet. Without 
sharing personal viewpoints, the 
passion for action will never be 
heard by mega-corporations or 
elected officials.
After the strike, several pro-
testers turned this passion into 
a legitimate call for change 
and went to strike at the Flem-
ing Administration Building on 
campus. They tried to create an 
open dialogue with President 
Mark Schlissel and expose the 
University’s stance on climate 
change policies and carbon neu-
trality. Currently, the University 
has not established clear efforts 
in the way of environmental pro-
cedures. Other Big Ten schools 
are surpassing our less than suc-
cessful commitment to cleaner 
energy and awareness.
Engineering 
junior 
Dhruv 
Tatke explained the necessary 
action the University must take 
in the face of clear environmen-
tal changes and dangers. “We 
need the University to com-
mit to a true and just transition 
to carbon neutrality by 2030, 
including immediate divestment 
from fossil fuels. This goal, that 
has been chosen by a group of 
students who have been help-
ing to coordinate the Climate 
Action Movement on and off 
campus, keeps with the IPCC 
Report which requires that the 
world needs to cut its emissions 
by 40 percent by 2030 if we are 
to keep the planet from warm-
ing 2 degrees Celsius above pre-
industrial temperatures. As a 
center of wealth and privilege, it 
is imperative that the University 
is a leader in this effort.”
This protest resulted in stu-
dent sit-ins, which Tatke helped 
organize, to make these ideas 
reality.

T

oday, a number of places 
suffer from a lack of housing 
being built. My home, the 
Bay Area, and my adopted home, 
Ann Arbor, have seen increases in 
the demand for affordable housing 
without a corresponding increase in 
the supply. What has happened as a 
result is unsustainable. MLive reports 
that from 2015 to July 2018, “Ann 
Arbor has added 50 new affordable 
housing units. The goal was to have 
420 new units by the end of the 
year.” The lack of housing in Ann 
Arbor also has another effect, which 
is that Ypsilanti ends up being the 
de facto housing bank. This will not 
work in the long-term, as Ypsilanti 
will eventually run out of housing as 
well, and then what? Policy that could 
be utilized to address this issue is 
building more housing while radically 
“up-zoning” much of Washtenaw 
County.
Most students have enrolled in 
some kind of introductory economics 
course and/or understand that the 
downward sloping demand line will 
meet the upward sloping supply line 
at a certain point, what we in the 
biz call “equilibrium.” This specific 
case of disequilibrium represents an 
excess demand, and the easiest way to 
rectify this would be to simply build 
more housing — especially affordable 
housing. However, there is a bit of a 
catch-22.
While this would be an easy way 
to address the problem in theory, in 
practice it gets much harder. Building 
housing does not tend to be terrifically 
popular with those who already 
own property in the area, because 

they assume that more housing 
would drop their property values. A 
fundamental issue is that everyone 
feels they must have a backyard and 
picket fence, and this only happens 
via exclusionary zoning that favors 
single-family homes. 

When cities had less people, that 
idea worked because fewer people 
needed housing; today, that is not 
the case. Ann Arbor’s choice to 
downzone 
neighborhoods 
while 
suffering from a lack of affordable 
housing represents a rare policy that 
both looks bad now and will age 
poorly — truly a parable for our times. 
In fact, the exact opposite of this 
should and needs to be done. People 
cannot all live in single-family homes. 
However, there is nothing wrong with 
much more liberalized regulations on 
housing. Japan did it and ended up 
with incredibly affordable cities. As a 
result, Tokyo is a great place to live.
Japan’s policies also offer a bit of a 
cautionary tale about how much local 
government can really do. According 
to Market Urbanism, there are three 
main reasons that Japan was able to 

create the housing market they have 
today. First, housing was less of an 
investment in Japan. Second, public 
services are not administered at the 
local level in Japan. And third, the 
review process to build housing in 
the U.S. is different than it is in Japan, 
as deference is given to local special 
interests. All of these explanations 
point in one direction, and it is not 
a positive one for fans of incredibly 
localized government. It demonstrates 
that cities will not be able to act alone 
to address this crisis and there needs 
to be federal policies put into place 
to ease the pressure of housing. In 
the U.S., a house is the biggest asset 
many people own. From this point of 
view, it makes sense they would fight 
attempts to lower that value, but that 
does not mean it is sound policy. In 
addition to this, where students live 
determines what school they can go 
to from kindergarten through 12th 
grade, and this is usually funded by 
property taxes. By building more 
housing, it is likely that there would be 
more students, something that should 
generate more support than it has.
This illustrates that there is a limit 
to local control. If there is continued 
demonstration of an inability to solve 
this problem by slashing more zoning 
regulations or using tax credits, then 
there is no choice but for higher levels 
of government to step in and take a 
more active role. This should not be 
a first choice, but at a certain point 
if the local government is unable 
to address the problem, something

I

n America, shootings have 
become part of the news cycle. 
There is a breaking news alert, 
followed by an outpouring of sup-
port, condolences and appeals for 
stricter gun policy. We continue 
to hear about it as the media gains 
more information on the event — 
the victims, the shooter, the town 
where it happened. We sometimes 
hear from the victims directly. 
But then, like all things, it eventu-
ally dwindles. And with each gut-
wrenching, breaking news alert, 
we slowly adjust to a world in 
which this is normal. Today is the 
129th day of 2019 and, already, 132 
mass shootings where four or more 
people were shot have occurred in 
America this year. Despite the value 
of each unique human life and each 
unique 
circumstance, 
shootings 
occur in America so often that, with 
every bullet and every life lost, we 
become increasingly desensitized 
to the appalling acts of hate that 
plague our nation with increasing 
frequency.
On April 27, 2019, a shooting 
occurred at a synagogue in Poway, 
California, 
where 
worshippers 
gathered on the last day of Passover. 
Three people were injured and one 
woman was killed — Lori Gilbert 
Kaye, who was shot as she prepared 
to say the traditional prayer for her 
late mother. Any loss of life or inten-
tionally inflicted harm is tragic, but 
even more so when motivated by 
intolerance and hate.
As I have observed the ebb and 
flow of gun terror and hate crimes 
in America, I’ve noticed a pat-
tern in how people react. More 
often than not, when people post 
on social media or speak out about 
one of these events, it is when their 
identity is the one that is attacked. 
While I have never been religious, 
the Jewish identity I inherited from 
my mother’s family is something 
that will always be a part of me. The 
history of anti-Semitism is long and 
violent with Jews being discrimi-
nated against, displaced, targeted 
and even killed. Even though I am 
not religious, even though my father 
is not Jewish, it would not make a 
difference in the eyes an anti-Sem-
ite. For the shooter of the Chabad of 
Poway synagogue, it would not have 
mattered.
This is not the only reason why I 
am driven to speak about the shoot-
ing. I speak about the shooting not 
just because I am a Jewish person, 
not just because I am an American, 
but because I am a human being. I 
may be more directly impacted by 

the hate perpetuated against those 
in this synagogue than those shot in 
two of New Zealand’s mosques, but 
both are tragic, and both deserve 
condemnation. All shootings, espe-
cially those motivated by hatred 
towards certain groups, are tragic, 
despite the seemingly endless slew 
of them in America.
The importance of diversity and 
the influence of different identi-
ties such as religion, ethnicity and 
nationality are essential. They are 
what make America such a spe-
cial country. American culture is 
defined not by a singular legacy, but 
rather by the mixing of many dif-
ferent ones. Our differences enable 
us to learn from and grow closer to 
each other. But, in a world where 
marginalized identities are con-
stantly on the defense, we are losing 
one of the most beautiful aspects 
of what makes us human: empathy. 
By emphasizing the cultural, racial, 
ethnic and religious differences that 
distinguish us in response to the 
hostilities that permeate society, we 
are losing the ability to empathize 
and identify with other humans.
But we can do amazing things 
when we come together, defending 
the freedom so fundamental to our 
country not just for our own com-
munities, but for those of all groups. 
After the Tree of Life shooting, 
Muslim groups raised $150,000 for 
the victims. And when two mosques 
in New Zealand were targeted, the 
Jewish Federation of Greater Pitts-
burgh raised money for New Zea-
land’s Muslim community. Not only 
are we at our strongest when we are 
able to look beyond our own identi-
ties, but it is imperative that we help 
and defend each other in order to 
truly work towards equality.
The other day, I was talking about 
politics with my grandmother, who 
is Republican, on the phone and 
she said something that struck me. 
As we discussed the inequality and 
violence in today’s America, she 
said, “We’re all American. It doesn’t 
matter where you go to pray.” 
We’re all American, but even 
more 
fundamentally, 
we’re 
all 
human. We need better gun con-
trol laws, but that’s not all; Amer-
ica needs to address the thriving 
intolerance, hate and violence. We 
must realize that, while America’s 
strength is in our diversity, our 
greatest weakness is when we allow 
our individual identities to separate 
us.

Another shooting. I can’t say I’m surprised

enjamin Franklin once 
said there are two things 
that are certain in life: 
death and conspiracy theories. 
OK, that may be paraphrasing 
but, when it comes to American 
society, it’s true. Conspiracy 
theories have become so deeply 
ingrained in the history of the 
United States that the majority 
of Americans don’t know what to 
believe. Was JFK’s assassination 
more than a one-man job? More 
than half of Americans think 
so. Did the real Paul McCartney 
die and get replaced by a fake 
Paul or “Faul”? Even I believe 
that one (a little bit). Conspiracy 
theories are as American as 
deep-fried Oreos and NASCAR, 
but, as fun as they are to joke 
about, they can have dangerous 
consequences on the American 
psyche and the people being 
conspired about.
The talk of conspiracy theo-
ries was recently revived with 
the #FreeBritney trend blow-
ing up on Twitter. If you haven’t 
been following this roller coast-
er of information, the story goes 
that, after the 37-year-old singer 
checked herself into a mental 
health facility following the 
declining health of her father, 
someone claiming to be a former 
member of her team went on a 
fan contest to say Spears’s hos-
pital check-in wasn’t by her own 
doing. Apparently, all of Spears’s 
choices were orchestrated by 
her family and her management 
team, following a legal device 
called 
conservatorship. 
This 
led to an outcry among fans, 
protesting in Los Angeles and 
sharing stories on Twitter about 
strange behavior they witnessed 
from Spears’s team. Spears, of 
course, has denied that she has 
no control over her life, but this 
just ignited the #FreeBritney 
movement even more.
And that is the exact problem 
with conspiracy theories — they 
can never be stopped. Once the 

idea gains ground, anyone trying 
to reject the theory is just anoth-
er part of the conspiracy. Spears 
went on Instagram to address 
the rumors, but fans and follow-
ers alike claimed this was just 
another example of her not being 
in control of her life. Conspiracy 
theories feed off of their deniers 
and, when they fester, they can 
cause real-life consequences.
When Hillary Clinton was 
running for president, a theory 
went viral that she was involved 
in some sort of child sex ring/
human-trafficking ordeal that 
involved a pizzeria in the Wash-
ington D.C. area. To most of us, 
that sounds absolutely absurd. 
However, right-wing media out-
lets, including former Trump 
White House Chief Strategist 
Steve Bannon’s passion proj-
ect Breitbart News, spread the 
theory 
and 
many 
far-right-
wingers believed it. The theory 
went so far, in fact, that a young 
man armed with an AR-15 rifle 
opened fire in the pizza shop to 
“investigate” the claims. Fortu-
nately, no one was injured.
So why do these conspiracy 
theories exist? Studies show 
that trust in the government 
has been on a decline since the 
Nixon 
Administration. 
With 
this lack of trust comes skepti-
cism and cynicism, and with 
skepticism and cynicism comes 
the belief that the government 
or other public officials are hid-
ing something. It’s only natural 
to want to fill in the blanks.
Conspiracy theories can be 
fun sometimes. Did The Beatles 
leave clues about Paul’s death in 
their music? I don’t know, but it’s 
entertaining to look for them. Is 
Madonna a lizard overlord sent 
to control humankind from the 
inside? Probably. These theories 
may be ridiculous but they’re 
fun — they cause no harm. The 
danger is when we allow our 
theorizing nature to seep into 
our politics, to treat politics as 

if it comes with the same drama 
and absurdity that pop culture 
does.
Trust in our pop culture fig-
ures is not vital to the struc-
tural foundation of this country. 
Roseanne Barr is not the one 
deciding what I can and cannot 
do with my body — and thank 
god for that. I don’t need to have 
faith that Jennifer Aniston won’t 
start a war in Iraq or that Alec 
Baldwin won’t cut social secu-
rity. However, losing trust in the 
government and living under 
the notion that the government 
is constantly hiding something 
from you damages civic effi-
cacy and in turn damages our 
democracy. Why would I vote 
if I think that, no matter who I 
want in office, there is a myste-
rious board of people really run-
ning the scene? Why even bother 
to cast a ballot in the primary if 
all candidates are lizard-people 
anyway? These sound like silly 
examples, but up until these 
past midterms, voter turnout 
followed the same downwards 
trend as trust in the government.
I don’t want conspiracy theo-
ries to end — I find them fasci-
nating, and what else could I find 
over 700 words to write about? 
But we must get to a place where 
we can separate our friendly, 
funny theories of quirky celebri-
ties with harmful, chaotic ideas. 
Politics is not pop culture and vice 
versa, but the way we treat one 
has dire effects on the way we see 
the other. When the CNN website 
looks like a screenshot from The 
Onion, it is easy to lose trust in 
your government, to theorize why 
things are the way they are. It is 
important not to get caught up in 
that, to know that the people who 
can change the country and con-
trol the things that happen aren’t 
a board of mysterious figures in a 
back room, but in fact all of us.

ARTS

After releasing her ruthless, 
heavy-hitting 2018 album Nasty, 
Rico Nasty seemed ready to burst 
from the underground and dominate 
the mainstream. Her collaborations 
with Kenny Beats, the underground 
producer du jour, have been nothing 
shy of sensational, particularly when 
they involved flipping a classic sam-
ple or reworking a legendary beat. 
Take her song “Countin’ Up,” for 
example. Kenny 
Beats 
cooked 
up 
a 
bass-
dominated, 
smile-inducing 
retooling of The 
Neptunes’s beat 
for 
Noreaga’s 
“Superthug,” 
and Rico Nasty 
proceeded to rip 
it to shreds. Rico 
Nasty’s 
tenac-
ity and ferocity 
are what made 
Nasty one of the 
best rap releases 
of 2018, so when 
she announced 
Anger Manage-
ment, all the 
eyes in the rap world were on her.
From the get-go, Anger Man-
agement finds Rico Nasty with the 
pedal on the floor. After all, the 
album promises the energy of a 
temper tantrum. She’s pure gas on 
album opener “Cold.” She does it 
all on this song: She talks shit over 
yet another face-melting beat from 
Kenny Beats, she raps aggressively 
and she screams. A lot. It’s refresh-
ing. I don’t think I’ve ever heard a 
rap album with a sound quite like 
this, and I especially don’t think I’ve 
heard one poised to sustain this type 
of energy over the full runtime. Rico 
Nasty attempts to do just that on 
this album, but that may be because 
it barely clocks in at 19 minutes in 
length. It’s short, sweet and to the 
point, but that might turn out to be 
too good to be true.
Other high points include the 
Earthgang-assisted “Big Titties” and 
the Jay-Z/Timbaland- interpolating 
“Hatin.” “Big Titties” finds Rico, 
Earthgang, Kenny Beats and dance 

producer/“Harlem Shake” creator 
Baauer at their most kinetic. Kenny 
Beats and Baauer lay down a ridicu-
lous beat accented by wacky vocal 
samples, wolf-whistles and clanging 
cowbells, not to mention absolutely 
pummelling 808s. Rico Nasty and 
Earthgang both deliver acrobatic 
verses, but Rico Nasty is especially 
elastic, bending words and syllables 
at whim. She throws down some 
complex bars, some funny ones too, 
and she even spits a bar in which 
she claims she’s so “supercalifra-
gilisticexpialidocious.” It’s fun, and 
it’s definitely a 
welcome change 
of pace in today’s 
rap climate.
“Hatin” finds 
Rico Nasty spit-
ting over a Kenny 
Beats remake of 
Jay-Z and Tim-
baland’s hit “Dirt 
Off Your Shoul-
der,” similar to 
Nasty’s 
remake 
of 
“Superthug.” 
Where Jay-Z was 
reserved, 
Rico 
Nasty is vicious. 
She goes hard, 
and she knows it. 
She talks smack 
with the best of 
them. To that end, she kicks the song 
off by exclaiming, “I got bitches on 
my dick and I ain’t even got a dick.” 
“Hatin” is a perfect modern remake 
of a classic song, and Rico Nasty cer-
tainly does it justice.
Surprisingly, outside these songs, 
the album begins to drag, and, at 
19 minutes in length, that is not a 
good thing. As Rico Nasty begins to 
cool off, the album’s quality begins 
to diminish. Songs like “Mood” 
and “Relative” are decent at best. 
The closing half of the album feels 
rushed. It’s good, no doubt, but it 
seems unfinished. Even with the 
tonal shifts, the album still begins to 
feel a bit samey. Anger Management, 
while certainly good in its own right, 
does not call for many repeat listens 
outside of a few sensational and 
truly different tracks like “Hatin” 
and “Cold.” It does, however, call 
for more attention to be paid to both 
Rico Nasty and Kenny Beats in the 
future because, clearly, they are on 
the verge of a breakthrough.

“Long Shot” is certainly titled 
around its premise: The political 
rom-com stars Charlize Theron 
(“Tully”) as the U.S. Secretary 
of State and Seth Rogen (“The 
Interview”) as her speechwrit-
er and eventual love interest. 
Theron’s incandescent, piercing 
beauty contrasts so starkly with 
the 
guffawing 
teddy-bearish 
charm of Rogen, but the movie’s 
core irony is that they success-
fully conjure a believable chem-
istry with each other.
For me, the most difficult lit-
mus test for any comedy is sim-
ply how frequently its jokes land. 
“Long Shot” definitely passed. I 
often found myself laughing at 
both the cheap and the nuanced 
gags. The film achieves an effec-
tive balance between the two, 
featuring moments like Rogen 
crashing down a sleek glass 
staircase as well as snarky, intel-
ligent one-liners about global 
politics. While the pacing of 
the story had its flaws, slogging 
through scenes that felt inessen-
tial, the film itself never paused 
to become totally serious. Even 
when hostage crises and bomb 
threats erupt, Rogen’s awkward, 
hyperventilating Fred Flarsky is 
always there to remind us that 
we are still inside a comedy.
But perhaps what’s worth 
discussing more than the two 
stars’ ability to carry the entire 
movie on the hilarity of their 

romance is the potent politi-
cal ideas the film suggests. The 
world of “Long Shot” is a politi-
cally sardonic reflection of our 
own, built around both harsh 
realities and amusing hyperbo-
le. Bob Odenkirk (“Better Call 
Saul”), for example, plays Presi-

dent Chambers, who spends his 
Oval Office scenes not signing 
bills and planning policy, but 
watching old episodes of him-
self in his heyday as a TV star. 
Another fascinating character 
is media mogul Parker Wembley 
(Andy Serkis, “Black Panther”), 
some toadish combination of 
Rupert Murdoch, Steve Bannon, 
Harvey Weinstein and Exxon-
mobil. He and Chambers, the 
amalgamations of evil that per-

meate all politics in the world of 
“Long Shot,” are unambiguously 
wicked, compelling vehicles for 
commentary on how citizens 
and politicians should respond 
to their brand of malice.
One of the more question-
able ideas the film suggested 
was that of centrism and com-
promise as long-term paths to 
victory. Charlotte’s ambitious 
environmental reform policy, 
while resonating with her diplo-
matic audience, faces the recur-
ring dilemma between integrity 
and widespread support. With 
more democratic presidential 
primary candidates seeming to 
appear everyday, this particu-
lar notion of centrism as a tool 
seemed the most foreboding 
about current American politics. 
And yet, whether this message is 
appealing or not, the film itself 
could not clearly communicate 
the logic of its theory. The result 
was an ultimately idealistic, 
potentially problematic portrait 
of the 2020 presidential race.
And yet, for all of the parables 
it offers, “Long Shot” does not 
have to be an artifact of intense 
political scrutiny to enjoy it. 
The fact that it manages to carry 
any nuance at all is impressive 
in and of itself. As a pleasant 
and satisfying crowd-pleaser, 
it more than works. Maybe the 
title encompasses more than 
a relationship between Fields 
and Flarsky, also taking up the 
hopes of remedying rampant 
corruption in our political sys-
tem. And if that’s an idea too 
alarming to swallow, don’t fret 
— it’s just a rom-com.

‘Long Shot’ pulls off more 
than your typical rom-com

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Equal parts carefree and captivat-

ing, drag mother-daughter duo Ariana 
Grindr and Daya Bee-Dee have become 
something of a fixture in the Ann Arbor 
queer community. Ariana, given name 
Will Beischel, and Daya Bee-Dee, given 
name Ariel Friedlander, sat down with 
me to talk about themselves, their rela-
tionship, the local drag scene and the 
all-encompassing presence of Lady 
Gaga.

The Michigan Daily: Thank 

you both so much for being here, 
you’re both amazing queens and 
I’m very excited to speak with you 
today. How long have each of you 
been performing, and what made 
you decide to participate in the art 
of drag?

Ariana Grindr: I started perform-

ing about two-and-a-half to three 
years ago in Chicago, before I moved 
here, but even before that — I was 
going to gay bars in Cincinnati, where 
I’m from, since I was 18 and (that 
was) before I came out. I was going 
to see these performances with my 
best friends and becoming enthralled 
with the queens. I think that being 
there and seeing people celebrate 
their femininity and their queerness 
in such a loud, sort of in-your-face 
way was really refreshing and inspir-
ing, so I’ve always had a special place 
in my heart for drag.

I toyed with the idea of doing it 

for a while, but I never was able to 
go through with it until one of my 
friends in Chicago, Alex Kay, started 

doing drag and I saw him become 
really good at it. There was a new 
space in Chicago at the time called 
Crash Landing, which was a compe-
tition show that allowed new queens 
a space to try it out for the first time 
and get their name out there in a 
supportive environment. After I saw 
Alex perform for a while, I was like 
“Alright, I’m signed up for it so I bet-
ter do this … ” Alex helped me get into 
drag for my first time and, yeah, the 
rest is herstory.

TMD: That’s beautiful, what 

about you (Daya)?

Daya Bee-Dee: So I’m what the 

kids call a baby queen, because I only 
started about 10 months ago. The first 
time I ever did drag, in public, was for 

a protest/guerilla fashion show with 
a radical leftist group called RadFun.

TMD: I’ve heard of RadFun.
DB: I invited a couple local queens 

to join, which was where I first met 
Ariana Grindr in person, so it’s very 
near and dear to my heart. From 
there … I was posting stories on Ins-
tagram when another queen found 
me and said I had to start perform-
ing, so I did a couple shows, and then 
I went to New York for the summer. 
When I came back, I started taking 

my drag really seriously, and for the 
past few months I’ve been trying to 
do shows more consistently to try and 
step up my game in terms of makeup, 
performance, etc. But I’ve just really 
loved (drag) from a really young age, I 
got pretty into “RuPaul’s Drag Race” 
soon after because my mom was pret-
ty into it.

I always loved “Drag Race,” but 

I never really thought that drag 
was necessarily for me because the 
presentation that I saw of drag was 
something that was for cis men. It just 
wasn’t something I felt like I could 
do until I found out that my absolute 
favorite drag queen, Creme Fatale, 
is actually a woman! And that really 
opened up a world of possibilities, 
and I’m honored to be a part of such 
an incredible community. I love that 
I can express my gender, my sexual-
ity, my everything, and I truly believe 
that drag is for everyone.

TMD: You were talking about 

“RuPaul’s Drag Race” and the 
modern conception of what drag 
is. While what the show has done 
and what it means in the larger 
framework of popular culture is 
undoubtedly a net positive, it has 
also created a model for what drag 
should be and commodified it in 
the process. Do you want to talk a 
little bit about what your experi-
ences have been as a woman par-
ticipating in drag and existing in a 
space that might be outside of that 
conception?

DB: I’m really lucky because, here 

in Ann Arbor, the scene is really sup-
portive. Online, you do see a lot of 
hatred, a lot of misunderstandings 

that can be hard to look at. Even here, 
I’ve heard people say things that are 
just complete misconceptions about 
what drag is, who it’s for and what 
it represents. I’m not laughing at 
women by being a drag queen. I am 
a fucking woman, and I love being a 
woman. I almost see drag as an exten-
sion of my gender identity, expressing 
something that’s as hyper-feminine 
as you can get, and it’s a way for me to 
celebrate being a high-femme, bisex-
ual woman.

People love to say that I’m appro-

priating drag, which is funny to me 
because the modern drag movement 
in the U.S. was pioneered by trans 
women of color. Trans women are 
women, so for someone to say that 
women can’t do drag invalidates the 
work that those people have done. If it 
weren’t for those women, we literally 
would not have drag in this country, 
so I’m not appropriating anything. 
I know the space I 
occupy and I know 
my place as a woman. 
I also see a lot of 
misogyny within the 
queer 
community 

and I experience it 
firsthand, which is 
something I don’t 
think a lot of other 
drag queens neces-
sarily see, so I like 
to use my platform 
to call in the queer 
community and say, 
“Hey, we have some 
things to work on in 
terms of respecting 
women, in terms of 
respecting 
gender 

diversity, in terms of 
respecting people of 
different religions, in 
terms of respecting 
everyone.”

TMD: Thank you so much for 

sharing that. There are a lot of 
issues within the community that 
need to be addressed and that can 
get glossed over due to a sort of 
male-centric unitarianism, so I 
really appreciate that you incor-
porate that into your work.

DB: Thank you!
TMD: You touched on this a 

little bit already, but could you 
elaborate a little bit on the circum-
stances under which you two met?

DB: So I actually first saw Ariana 

perform at a feminist magazine’s 
Halloween drag show and she had no 
idea who I was at that point. At some 
point we became Facebook friends … 
don’t know exactly when that hap-
pened, but when I was helping put 
together this guerrilla fashion show 
with RadFun, we were looking for 
other people and organizations to 

reach out to. I was starting to get a 
little bit more into drag at that point 
even though I hadn’t performed very 
much myself. I knew that Ariana had 
the reputation of being a very politi-
cal queen, so I reached out to her on 
Facebook and I was so nervous mes-
saging her.

AG: (laughs)
DB: I actually looked back at our 

first exchange and I can tell just how 
nervous I was and how I was trying 
so hard to make her happy. But it was 
the day of the fashion show and we 
were in Graffiti Alley, I basically had 
my whole closet with me dressing 
people up in my clothes and prepar-
ing to walk through the Diag a little 
bit later, and there was Ariana. She 
was wearing all black, in her natural, 
short boy hair, face full of gold make-
up and these massive 12-inch heels,

TMD: I’ve seen those heels!
DB: We strutted all the way down 

the Diag together, 
we even infiltrated 
an ROTC ceremony 
and screamed about 
Syria and Palestine 
— it was a very con-
frontational 
dem-

onstration. Anyway, 
that was where I 
met my drag mother. 
At the time I didn’t 
know what our rela-
tionship would turn 
out to be. I had just 
spent the summer in 
New York and I was 
really hard on myself 
during that time. I 
was surrounded by 
this really beautiful 
drag and I was flood-
ed on social media 
by people who were 
so good at makeup 

and so good at performing and it was 
so overwhelming — the person who 
won (RuPaul’s) Drag Race at the time 
(Aquaria) was like 22 years old and 
stunning and I was like, “Fuck, I am 
so behind on my art.”

I remember having a conversation 

with Ariana on Instagram, she ended 
up inviting me over to her apartment 
to get ready and work on our makeup 
together and I remember just feel-
ing so honored and my heart was so 
full with gratefulness and joy. At the 
time I really looked up to her because 
she was just this really political, put-
together, well-respected queen in 
Ann Arbor. So I went over there, we 
shared our woes and I laid all of my 
insecurities out on the line, and after 
that conversation it pretty much was 
mother-daughter.

Students, parents, faculty and 
guOn 
Friday 
afternoon, 
about 
15 
members 
and 
supporters 
of the University of Michigan 
Lecturers’ Employee Organization 
gathered at Hill Auditorium for an 
informational picket. They claimed 

the University’s School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance administration 
was trying to drastically cut the 
course loads and salaries of two 
SMTD 
lecturers 
in 
violation 
of their union contracts. LEO 
picketers, carrying signs stating 
“#RespectTheLecs,” handed out 
informational flyers to graduates 
and families arriving for SMTD 

graduation.
According to LEO, the School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance is giving 
classes taught by lecturers Missy 
Beck and Jean-Claude Biza to 
tenure-track faculty in order to 
avoid paying Beck and Biza higher 
wages won under the contract LEO 
ratified last year.
Beck and Biza are “two of 
the 
longest-serving 
Lecturer 
faculty members in the Dance 
Department,” 
LEO 
explained. 
Beck, a Lecturer II who has taught 
in SMTD for 18 years and full-time 
for the last 15, will have her annual 
salary cut almost in half, from 
$57,500 to $29,468, according to 
LEO. Biza, who has taught in SMTD 
for 32 years, will lose almost two-
thirds of his annual salary, from 
$23,025 to $7,866.
In July 2018, after months of 
collective bargaining, LEO and the 
University ratified a new contract, 
which enacted salary increases 
and bolstered health benefits and 
job security for non-tenure track 
faculty at all three University 
campuses. Per the new contract’s 
terms, by September 2020, starting 
salaries 
for 
lecturers 
in 
Ann 
Arbor are to receive a 47.8 percent 
increase, while Flint and Dearborn 
faculty should see 50.2 percent and 
44.9 percent increases respectively.
In an interview with The Daily, 
Beck said she has an email from 

Interim Chair of Dance Anita 
Gonzalez stating decisions to cut 
Beck’s and Biza’s course loads and 
pay were made following LEO 
bargaining for wage increases.
“Biza and I got the largest raises 
in that contract agreement, and 
we’ve been the only two that’ve 
been targeted,” Beck said. “So, that 
speaks for itself in my mind.”
In an email to The Daily, 
Gonzalez said there is not an email 
from her attributing SMTD cuts to 
LEO’s bargaining success.
University 
spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald 
provided 
an 
email 
statement on behalf of SMTD Dean 
David Gier, emphasizing that Gier 
has expressed “SMTD will not 
make personnel decisions based 
on LEO’s success at the bargaining 
table.”
“This review will include an 
examination of teaching loads and 
course 
enrollment,” 
Fitzgerald 
wrote. “It is a normal part of what 
any school and college on our 
campus does on a regular basis, 
particularly as new deans are 
selected. SMTD and the university 
will carefully follow the process 
outlined in the LEO contract, should 
there be any workload changes that 
affect lecturers.”
Beck defended her qualifications 
and discussed the success of her 
students, some of whom have sent 
letters and video testimonials to 

Beck’s teaching.
“I’m the one who’s actually in the 
classroom,” Beck said. “I’m the one 
who has working alum in the top of 
the field saying, ‘She taught us this.’ 
I have dozens of alum writing letters 
and sending videos — many of them 
working in Broadway, the first Black 
Elsa in ‘Frozen,’ a casting agent, 
people who are now professors of 
dance in universities, people who’ve 
won Oscars, Tony’s — saying it was 
my influence that helped them. 
Administration doesn’t listen to its 
alum, and that’s worrisome. (To 
the administration), it’s not about 
education, it’s about money.”
LEO President Ian Robinson, a 
lecturer in the Residential College, 
expressed he feels Beck and Biza’s 
pay shouldn’t be cut to save money 
within SMTD.
“They’re not hurting for that 
money,” Robinson said. “I don’t 
believe that amount of money 
means a damn to a school the size 
of this one. Furthermore, if this 
really did matter … impose it on the 
administrators ... (who are) getting 
paid what is probably too much to 
begin with, if I’m frank. But (SMTD 
administration) 
get 
raises 
and 
claw back money from lecturers by 
taking away their livelihood after 
they’ve been excellent teachers. 
How can that possibly be right?”

Hello class of 2019
I come here today to 
not only speak about my 
story but to speak on our 
journey together and val-
idate it.
Although each of our 
journeys have been dif-
ferent, we all fought with 
the same resiliency. 
We 
have 
conquered 
so much and sitting here 
proves that whether it 
was going through tough 
classes, long nights, or 
lots of cramming. We got 
through it. 
We even thought our 
summer experience with 
ALMA, CSP, or Bridge 
was going to be our col-
lege experience, but we 
quickly came to find out 
it wasn’t. 
We sat in classes with 
people who did not look 
or talk like us. 
We engaged in difficult 
conversations where we 
were tokenized 
We experienced exclu-
sion from this university, 
and with little knowledge 
on how to navigate it. 
And, 
let’s 
not 
talk 
about the food
But, we rose together 
to create spaces for our 
community, to support 
one another. 
Through these spaces 
we danced, laughed, and 
created many memories 
together. 

And most importantly 
it gave everyone a home 
away from home
Because of your work, 
your efforts, and your 
time future Latinx stu-
dents will no longer feel 
alone. 
You have gained the 
skills needed to make a 
change in your own pro-
fessional careers.
In 
this 
moment, 
I 
would like for you all to 
imagine in your head of 
who you want to become 
whether it is being an 
activist, a politician, or 
teacher (2 seconds) now 
imagine yourself in that 
position. I am standing 
here today to tell you, you 
can be that person and if 
you continue to live your 
life with the same resil-
iency you fought to create 
spaces for our commu-
nity and achieve this 
degree you can achieve 
that image. 
As you go into your 
professional careers, the 
statistics will always be 
against you. But, those 
statistics 
don’t 
know 
what is en tu corazon 
(points at heart). In here 
lies your passion, deter-
mination, 
and 
drive. 
And most importantly 
you have the people here 
in this room to support 
you on your next jour-
ney. Both combined your 
unstoppable. 
I didn’t want to make 
this speech about me 
because I always strived 

throughout 
my 
work 
with La Casa and Latini-
dad Magazine to provide 
a voice to the voiceless 
pero mi familia esta aqui 
y tengo que ablar de mi 
un ponquito. Les quiero 
dicer a mis padres que 
sin ellos no estaria aqui. 
Ellos han trabajado en 
fabricas desde que cru-
zaron la frontera mas 
de 20 anos y con mucho 
amor y esfuerzo me saca-
ron adelante. 
I am the girl from Her-
mosa community on the 
west side of Chicago, first 
generation Latina who 
made it. Y sin mi familia 
no estuviera aqui con 
ustedes. So quiero dicer-
les muchas gracias y los 
amos mucho. 
I know many of you 
feel the same about your 
families. So, let’s give 
them a huge applause
At the end of this cer-
emony, I want you all to 
give them a huge hug
I want to reiterate how 
resilient our community 
and each one of you are
And make you under-
stand how powerful your 
voice and actions are in 
creating change 
The world is not ready 
for you but it needs you 
You are the leaders of 
our generation and have 
paved the way for future 
generations. 
Always go with your 
head held up high and 
take on the world.
Thank you

How ‘Old Town Road’ showed 
unity in the Black community

Every community has 
its lost of taboo topics. 
Some in the black commu-
nity include mental health 
(sadly) and therapy. But 
one that is not often real-
ized is country music. It’s 
ok if someone doesn’t like 
the stereotypical things 
like rap music or Kool-aid. 
But don’t let anyone find 
out that you liked Taylor 
Swift in her “You Belong 
With Me” days and you 
might get your revoked. 
Even 
in 
a 
community 
where they accomplish-
ments of each one is widely 
celebrated, Darius Rucker, 
who won multiple Gram-
mys in the country catego-
ry got no such praise. This 
trend change when the 
remix to the country song 
“Old Town Road” by black 
country artist Lil Nas X 
came out.
 The popularity of this 
song didn’t at first come 
from the song itself, but 

from the story behind it. 
When the original version 
of the song came out about 
a year ago, it reached #1 on 
the country charts. How-
ever, not too long after, it 
was taken down due to the 
fact that it was too “urban.” 
This was met with the 
anger of many, especially 
since “urban” is usually 
the polite way of saying 
“black.” So when the remix 
featuring Billy Ray Cyrus 
came out, many people 
decided to support it for 
the culture. 
 
Even though this 
is how the popularity of 
Old Town Road started, 
this country song with 
a hip-hop beat quickly 
caught on in its own right. 
The fact that the song has 
a beat that is more similar 
to more mainstream songs 
is what reeled many peo-
ple in. And for those who 
watched Hannah Montana 
growing up, the fact that 
Billy Ray Cyrus was on a 
verse added a bonus ele-
ment of nostalgia. Since the 

remix came on, I’ve seen 
multiple people advertise 
it on their Snapchat, I’ve 
had people that I’m hang-
ing out with sing it while 
we’re at dinner, and I even 
heard it at a fraternity 
probate. 
Though 
there 
are many that are still 
just listening to the song 
for support, it still signals 
a shift in how we support 
those in our community 
that don’t fit exactly into 
this preconceived notion 
of blackness.
 
Simply 
listen-
ing to a song shows the 
amount of solidarity that 
this community can hold. 
We are willing to put aside 
our generalizations about 
who we’re supposed to be, 
as well as our community 
taboos in order to uplift 
one our people that was 
wronged.
 
No 
community 
is perfect, and this one is 
no 
exception. 
However, 
it is still a beautiful thing 
knowing that we can pull 
together when needed.

‘Us’: Reflecting on privilege 
dynamics in the US

On March 22, 2019, the 
highly anticipated movie 
“Us” directed by Jordan 
Peele was released. This 
movie was released with 
the intention and expecta-
tion of solely being a horror 
movie. This was a shocker 
to many, after Peele’s pre-
vious movie “Get Out” 
reflected on many racial 
tensions in the United 
States. Although “Us” had 
the intention of just being 
a horror movie, it turns 
out this was not the case. 
Many 
were 
confused, 
including me, about what 
happened in the movie. 
However, after doing some 

research, 
and 
watching 
many 
analytical 
videos 
on YouTube, I found that 
these easter eggs meant 
much more than what 
appeared to the eye. 
Immediately 
after 
watching the movie, I was 
confused. I got the main 
plot of the story, the world 
of the shadows or the “teth-
ered” came back to kill 
and take over the humans 
above ground. However, 
there were many easter 
eggs that I noticed, and 
knew were important, but 
did not know what exactly 
they meant. Everyone had 
a conspiracy theory after 
the movie, but it still didn’t 
make much sense to me 
and not all of my questions 
were answered. Finally, I 

came across a video put 
out by Insider that objec-
tively 
explained 
these 
easter eggs, and exposed 
the underlying theme of 
the movie ... privilege. 
Now, to dive into the 
theme of privilege, we can 
do some character evalu-
ations, 
beginning 
with 
the tethered vs the “regu-
lar” people. The people/
families represented in 
the movie were those of 
upper 
middle/high-class 
people. Both families were 
traveling on vacation, had 
summer homes, and gen-
erally ideal family and 
home lives.

Michigan pulls away late from Spartans to win midweek game

The seventh inning turned the 
tide for Michigan.
After barely surviving the top of 
the inning with the bases loaded 
and only one out, the Wolverines’ 
offense came to life — capitalizing 
on a throwing error, a hit-by-pitch 
and a wild pitch. The game was 
put out of reach for in-state rival 
Michigan State (16-30 overall, 5-12 
Big Ten) as it went down 5-0 to the 
hosts at Ray Fisher Stadium.
In their third meeting on the 
season, the Michigan baseball 
team (35-11, 14-3) bested the 
Spartans 7-0 after pulling away 
late.
For the Wolverines, every hit 
mattered. A leadoff fly ball from 
sophomore 
designated 
hitter 
Jordan Nwogu bounced off the top 
of the wall in right field, forcing 
the right fielder to scramble after 
the ball to limit Nwogu to a triple. 
Sophomore center fielder Jesse 
Franklin then hit a sacrifice fly to 

bring in Nwogu for an early 1-0 
lead.
Two innings later, Franklin 
would strike again. This time with 
a 105-mile-per-hour bullet over 
the scoreboard in right field for a 
solo home run and a 2-0 lead for 
Michigan.
“Guys 
getting 
on 
base,” 
said 
Franklin. 
“Those 
sac-flies, I wasn’t 
really trying to hit 
pop ups like that 
because if nobody’s 
on base those are 
just big old pop 
flies. So just guys 
getting on base.”
Added Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich: 
“We took advantage of some 
opportunistic offense. We did a 
good job when we got runners to 
third base to get them in somehow, 
even if it wasn’t via a Franklin 
home run or sac fly, but just to find 
a way to knock those guys in.”
All told, the Wolverines scored 
seven runs on eight hits, balancing 

powerful batting with capitalizing 
on Michigan State’s mistakes.
Both 
teams 
had 
managed 
to find a way to shut down the 
opposing team’s offense until the 
seventh inning, when senior left-
hander Ben Keizer was in his third 
inning 
of 
relief. 
Zaid 
Walker 
managed a single, 
and pinch hitter 
Bailey 
Peterson 
reached base after 
a backhanded toss 
from 
sophomore 
shortstop 
Jack 
Blomgren 
drew 
senior 
second 
baseman 
Ako 
Thomas 
off 
the 
base.
Keizer was pulled before the 
inning ended and sophomore left-
hander Angelo Smith came in to 
get out of the jam. After giving up 
a four pitch walk to load the bases, 
Smith struck out the Spartan’s 
leadoff hitter. But the inning ended 
when a hard-hit ball to right field 
forced a diving catch from junior 

right fielder Jordan Brewer.
Michigan went on to score three 
runs in the bottom of the seventh 
and two runs in the bottom of the 
eighth to win the game 7-0.
“I walked the first guy,” Smith 
said. “From there I had to find it 
quick because the game’s getting 
close and if they score they’d only 
be down one so the next batter I 
threw three sliders and got him out 

in three pitches.”
Added 
Bakich: 
“All 
the 
momentum from then was on our 
side, we scored five runs in the 
next two innings after that. That 
was a huge moment in the game, 
if he dives and misses it, all three 
runs score. So, he took a chance 
and nailed it and got it. From that 
moment on you could just feel it 
was different.”

Men’s tennis bows out in second round of NCAA Tournament

For the seniors of the Michigan 
men’s 
tennis 
team, 
Saturday 
brought two endings.
Though 
Myles 
Schalet 
and 
Gabe 
Tishman 
missed 
commencement while in Waco, 
Texas for the NCAA Tournament, 
they still posed in caps and gowns 
to celebrate the culmination of 
their time as students.
A few hours later, their time 
as college athletes, too, came 
to an end. A day after beating 
Dartmouth (15-9), 4-2, on Friday, 
the 
20th-ranked 
Wolverines 
(18-9) fell to No. 6 Baylor (24-5), 
4-1, in the second round of the 
tournament.
Michigan started slow against 
the Big Green, losing its two 
completed 
doubles 
matches 
to drop the doubles point. But 
sophomore Mattias Siimar won at 
No. 3 singles in straight sets, 6-3, 
6-1, to tie the score.
“Mattias getting on the board 
for us was huge,” said Michigan 
coach Adam Steinberg. “He’s 
struggled a little bit as of late, 

so I was happy for him. When 
you lose the doubles point, it’s 
so important to get to one-all 
and you feel like, OK, back in the 
match.”
After Dartmouth regained the 
lead with a win at No. 4 singles, 
it seemed like the Wolverines 
were in trouble when freshman 
Patrick Maloney fell behind, 3-0, 
in his second set at the No. 5 slot. 
But Maloney battled back to win 
in straight sets, 7-5, 6-3, knotting 
the match back up. That provided 
the spark Michigan needed, as it 

took the matches at No. 2 and No. 
6 singles to seal the win — and 
the all-important second-round 
berth.
But if Friday’s matches started 
with a whimper and ended with 
a bang, Saturday’s were the 
opposite.
Facing the Bears as a significant 
underdog in the round of 32, the 
Wolverines dropped their match 
at No. 1 doubles before roaring 
back to take the remaining two, 
both in tiebreakers. Schalet and 
freshman Andrew Fenty jumped 

up and down and whooped as 
they clinched the doubles point 
that had eluded Michigan the day 
before.
“It was an exciting doubles 
point,” Steinberg said. “It was 
great. It doesn’t get much better 
than that for college tennis. We 
came through and we felt great 
about it going into the singles, so 
it’s a — against a team like Baylor, 
if you don’t win the doubles, 
you’re really in trouble.”
As the Wolverines learned, 
sometimes, against a team like 
Baylor, you’re in trouble anyway.
This time, the Bears were 
the team that got the score to 
one-all after losing the doubles 
point and simultaneously swung 
momentum in their favor. First, it 
was junior Connor Johnston who 
went down in straight sets, 2-6, 
3-6. The carnage only piled up as 
Fenty, then Tishman, then Siimar 
dropped their matches — all in 
straight sets.
Michigan won just two sets at 
singles — one each from Maloney 
and Schalet, both of whom were 
not afforded the chance to finish 
their matches with the result 
already decided.

“Our energy in the beginning 
of the singles needed to be much 
better,” Steinberg said. “For us, 
that’s who we are, our identity, 
and I don’t think we came out the 
way we should have and Baylor 
fed off that. They got confident 
quick and they have great players, 
so you give a little confidence 
to a team like that, with a lot of 
talent, they’re gonna take it and 
run with it. ... When you win the 
doubles, you gotta capitalize on 
it early, get some breaks, and we 
didn’t do that. And Baylor took 
control of the match.”
Fenty, ranked No. 48 in the 
country 
at 
singles, 
qualified 
for 
the 
NCAA 
Individual 
Championships later this month, 
the lone Wolverine who will 
keep playing after the team’s 
elimination.
Steinberg 
always 
tells 
his 
tournament teams that these are 
the moments they’ve worked for 
all year — the opportunity to play 
great teams like the Bears on the 
biggest stage in college tennis. 
But 
on 
Saturday, 
Michigan 
couldn’t take advantage of that 
opportunity, 
and 
its 
season 
unceremoniously came to a close.

Leadership, selflessness keys to Big Ten Tournament title run

When the Michigan softball team 
entered the conference season, it 
had already suffered ten losses and 
struggled against the likes of South 
Dakota and Louisville. While the 
pitching staff gave the Wolverines 
a chance in most games, especially 
in wins over then-No. 2 UCLA and 
then-No. 5 Washington, the offense 
struggled to produce any sort of 
traction. Failing to find hits with 
runners on base became Michigan’s 
Achilles heel and a run at the Big Ten 
seamed bleak.
But then the Wolverines caught 
their stride and they look like an 
entirely different team. Winning 
the Big Ten with a 22-1 conference 
record, Michigan has turned its 
most glaring weakness into one of 
its most reliable strengths in only 
two months — throughout Big Ten 

play, the Wolverines boasted league-
highs in batting average (.355) and 
RBIs (174). 
Winning its conference during the 
regular season isn’t out of the norm 
for Michigan, though. Since 2008, 
the Wolverines have won outright or 
grabbed a share of the Big Ten every 
year except for one. In that same 
time span, Michigan has won the 
Big Ten Tournament only once. And 
if the Wolverines want to prove that 
they deserve home field advantage 
for the NCAA regional, it could 
very well come down to the team’s 
performance on a weekend that has 
historically been their kryptonite. 
However, Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins feels there is something 
different in the air this season 
compared to teams of the past 
when the Wolverines fell short of a 
postseason conference title. 
“This year’s team has been 
extremely 
player-driven 
and, 
I 

would say, very much led by our 
senior class,” Hutchins said. “Our 
seniors have been outstanding all 
year from the moment they got back 
to campus in late August and made 
their statement that they wanted 
this team to be different than the 
last couple teams and they wrote out 
their own game plan for that.”
The shift in culture from previous 
years to now not only has started 
with the leadership and experience 
this team brings. Perhaps the 
most important quality Michigan 
possesses is its selfless dynamic.
“Honestly, from the minute we 
got back from our preseason travel, 
our team had kinda found its way 
through some really difficult early 
season games,” Hutchins said. “The 
seniors put the team on their back 
and said, we’re gonna get this done. 
And they’ve done it, of course, on 
the field. And when somebody isn’t 
getting it done, because inevitably 

every game, some people are on and 
some aren’t, they pick each other up. 
They’ve stepped up for each other 
and they never quit.
“This team has reminded me 
all season, especially in our last 
28 games, that they’re just one big 
selfless amoeba.”

So if the Wolverines are able to 
combine this culture with their 
season-long trend of righting their 
wrongs, both past and present, they 
could very well find themselves 
holding that Big Ten Tournament 
trophy that has eluded them year 
after year.

The Daily breaks down and predicts the Big Ten Tournament

After securing the outright Big 
Ten title Sunday, the Michigan 
softball team kicks off the Big Ten 
Tournament with its first game on 
Friday. The Wolverines picked up 
the top seed and earned a first-round 
bye for the sixth time in the last seven 
seasons. The Daily breaks down the 
tournament and gives its predictions. 
Daniel Dash, Daily Sports Writer
Michigan’s 
most 
valuable 
tournament asset: With six players 
batting over .300 and two over 
.400, the Wolverines’ depth and 
consistency separates them from the 
rest of the pack.
Michigan’s biggest tournament 
weakness: The Wolverines will have 
to play three games in two days if 
they advance to the finals, so having 
just two reliable pitchers — whereas 
most teams have three or four — 
could make fatigue an enemy.
Champion 
prediction: 
Minnesota
The Golden Gophers may have 
finished third in the conference’s 
regular season standings, but don’t 
let that fool you. Numbers don’t lie — 
Minnesota is arguably the Big Ten’s 
most talented team. Four Gophers 
are batting over .300, headlined 
by infielder MaKenna Partain’s 
.417 clip. In the circle, right-hander 

Amber Fiser boasts a conference-best 
1.25 ERA. Minnesota has won this 
tournament the last three years, so 
the roster knows what it takes.
Dark horse candidate: Illinois
Despite being the No. 9 seed, the 
Fighting Illini enter the Big Ten 
Tournament with the conference’s 
best offense. Illinois’ league-high 
.319 team batting average and .520 
slugging percentage could spearhead 
a Cinderella run, but its pitching staff 
must avoid imploding.
Lily Friedman, Daily Sports Writer
Michigan’s 
most 
valuable 
tournament asset: With five seniors 
starting in the Wolverine lineup, 
experience will be the team’s biggest 
asset going into the tournament. 
Under players like senior second 
baseman Faith Canfield and senior 
catcher Katie Alexander, the entire 
Michigan lineup has experience with 
close games and has thrived under 
the leadership of its seniors in tough 
innings.
Michigan’s biggest tournament 
weakness: 
A 
big 
problem 
for 
Michigan thus far this season has 
been 
inconsistency. 
While 
the 
Wolverines have won some matchups 
against 
highly-ranked 
opponents 
like No. 1 UCLA, the team’s struggles 
against subpar competition like 
South Dakota could pose an issue in a 
one-and-done tournament.
Champion 
prediction: 
Minnesota

Watching its third game against 
Northwestern, Minnesota looked 
strong, especially defensively. With 
right-hander Amber Fiser pitching 
tight like she did against formerly 
undefeated Northwestern and the 
rest of the pitching staff combining 
for its season-ERA of .171, Minnesota 
could play well enough defensively to 
lock in a tournament win.
Dark horse candidate: Ohio State
Though seeded fourth, Ohio State 
fell below Michigan, Northwestern 
and Minnesota in the regular season 
as far as competing for a Big Ten title. 
But the Buckeyes are still a strong 
contender to make a tournament run. 
Handing the Wolverines their first 
and only Big Ten loss this season, 
Ohio State could be in position to get 
hot in the tournament and make a 
championship run.
Lane Kizziah, Daily Sports Writer
Michigan’s 
most 
valuable 
tournament asset: Even early in 
the season when their offense was 
lacking, the Wolverines could count 
on their fielding to keep them in most 
games. Michigan currently leads the 
Big Ten with the fewest errors and 
the highest fielding percentage.
Michigan’s biggest tournament 
weakness: Pitching has frequently 
posed a problem for the Wolverines. 
While both freshman right-hander 
Alex Storako and sophomore left-
hander 
Meghan 
Beaubien 
are 
among the top 10 pitchers in the 

conference, Storako has struggled 
to remain consistent in later innings 
while Beaubien has already pitched 
183.2 innings and has seen her own 
performance fluctuate as the season 
has progressed. 
Champion 
prediction: 
Northwestern
Despite having a relatively young 
team, the second seeded Wildcats 
boast strong pitchers, including 
freshman Danielle Williams with 
an ERA of 1.46. Coupled with 
dependable fielding, Northwestern’s 
defense can hold most opponents to 
just a few runs. The Wildcats’ lack of 
command at the plate — a combined 
batting average of .273 — will likely be 
their biggest weakness. 
Dark horse candidate: Wisconsin
The fifth seeded Badgers may be 
the most well-rounded team. Not only 
do they possess the best hitter in the 
conference — Kayla Konwent with 
a batting average of .479 — they can 
also hold their own on defense. They 
have decent fielding statistics and the 
depth of their pitching staff should 
not be underestimated. Coming in 
with wins against Illinois, Indiana, 
and Nebraska, Wisconsin may have a 
shot this weekend.
Akul Vijayvargiya, Daily Sports 
Writer
Michigan’s 
most 
valuable 
tournament asset: With five seniors 
in the lineup and a conference-high 
332 runs scored throughout this 

season, 
the 
Wolverines 
possess 
leadership and a batting prowess they 
haven’t seen since the times of Sierra 
Romero.
Michigan’s biggest tournament 
weakness: Though the Wolverines 
are lucky to have such a reliable No. 
2 pitcher in freshman right hander 
Alex Storako behind sophomore All-
American Meghan Beaubien, both 
might be somewhat gassed by the 
end of the weekend which could hurt 
them in the championship game.
Champion prediction: Michigan
Coach 
Carol 
Hutchins 
has 
this team primed to win in the 
postseason. Not only will experience 
and consistency in the batting lineup 
bode well for the Wolverines, but the 
team has shown it can win against the 
likes of Minnesota and Northwestern 
with victories over No. 2 Washington 
and No. 3 UCLA. The first round 
bye will prove to be pivotal for the 
pitching staff as well since it might 
give Beaubien and Storako the last 
bits of energy they need to finish the 
weekend strong.
Dark horse candidate: Illinois
The Fighting Illini lost to the 
Wolverines by only one run in two of 
the three games they played against 
each other, so don’t count them out if 
they are to go against the top seed on 
Friday afternoon. If Illinois is able to 
clear that hurdle, it has the offensive 
firepower to spark another win or 
two on Saturday.

After waiting her turn, Canfield shines as a leader for ‘M’

On the brink of elimination, 
tensions ran high in the Michigan 
softball team’s dugout. In the 
on-deck circle, Faith Canfield was 
as relaxed as ever.
Trailing by a pair of runs in the 
seventh inning of the deciding 
game in the 2017 NCAA Regional, 
the 20th-ranked Wolverines found 
themselves desperate for offense 
on the road against No. 6 seed 
Washington. Just three outs stood 
between Michigan and the demise 
of its season.
Damp clumps of dirt broke free 
from junior right fielder Aidan 
Falk’s cleats as she trekked across 
the dugout to retrieve her bat. As 
Falk warmed up to lead off the 
Wolverines’ final chance to salvage 
the season, Canfield — a sophomore 
at that point — grabbed her by the 
arm.
“I don’t care what you do, just 
go have one hell of an at-bat,” 
Falk recalled Canfield telling her, 
“because this is your last one and it’s 
the one you’re going to remember 
most.”
Falk took the words to heart. Two 
pitches into her plate appearance, 
she laced a single up the middle to 
ignite Michigan’s comeback bid.
“There was a lot on the line,” Falk 
told The Daily in a phone interview 
last month. “(Canfield) took it as 
her time to be like, ‘You should 
be proud of what you’ve done. 
Enjoy it.’ She’s not one to be overly 
emotional or cozy, but when she 
does show you that side of her, it’s 
very meaningful.”
Some players stand up on a 
chair and berate a locker room of 
teammates. Canfield is not one of 
them — instead, she’s often a soft-
spoken leader who emphasizes 
living in the moment. Her attitude 
epitomizes the fact that leadership 
comes in many forms.
Canfield sees the game through 
a different lens, one which has 
fostered a unique college career 
brimming with memories such as 
Falk’s. Canfield naturally focuses on 
the human side of softball — a trait 
which has become increasingly rare 
in a game driven by analytics.
Though the Wolverines fell short 
on that ill-fated Seattle afternoon, 
Canfield’s style of leadership is 
invaluable.

With top-seeded Michigan — 
this season’s outright conference 
champion — set to take the field 
in 
the 
Big 
Ten 
Tournament 
quarterfinals on Friday, the final 
month of Canfield’s storied career 
has arrived. And with a solid 
showing in this week’s Big Ten 
Tournament, the Wolverines could 
earn the right to host an NCAA 
Regional of their own.
For Canfield, a much-anticipated 
climax has taken shape. In the next 
month, she could lead Michigan 
back to the Women’s College World 
Series for the first time since her 
freshman season. Or, as they’ve done 
the last two seasons, the Wolverines 
may 
fall 
in 
the 
conference 
tournament quarterfinals and fail to 
survive the NCAA Regional.
Regardless of how May unfolds, 
Canfield is going to stay true to 
her own style of leadership. So far, 
it’s made all the difference in her 
memorable Michigan tenure.
***
It might’ve been on the practice 
field. It could’ve been in the locker 
room afterwards. Abby Ramirez 
doesn’t remember the exact moment 
it hit her, but she’ll never forget her 
takeaway from the first practice of 
Canfield’s freshman season.
“This girl is for real,” Ramirez 
remembered thinking.
When Canfield got to campus 
in the fall of 2015, she began her 
career ahead of the curve. Ramirez 
— a two-time All-Big Ten shortstop 
who graduated in 2017 — recalled 
being impressed with her noticeable 
confidence and natural instincts 
from day one.
As a college freshman, Canfield 
put her decorated high school and 
travel ball careers behind her. She 
watched her sister Jamie succeed 
as an All-Big 12 catcher at Nebraska 
from 2004-2007, but still admittedly 
felt the pressure of walking into 
a program that finished as the 
national runner-up a mere three 
months earlier.
On top of the transition to a new 
level, Canfield found herself thrown 
for a loop by a slight position change. 
She claims to “love defense,” so her 
role as the team’s designated player 
in 2016 meant spending most of the 
season without her beloved glove.
“Coming in freshman year, it was 
a different role that I totally wasn’t 
used to,” Canfield said. “But I was 
all for it. I did whatever the team 
needed.”

The college level brought about 
its own challenges, and Ramirez 
had the pleasure of watching 
Canfield improve firsthand. As 
middle infielders, their position 
groups often trained together.
Only a few practices into the 
preseason, the Wolverines arranged 
a fall scrimmage in East Lansing. 
There, Canfield stepped into the 
batter’s box for her first college 
at-bat. As she walked up to the plate, 
she gazed at the field, the desolate 
bleachers 
and 
the 
clamoring 
dugouts. So, this was college softball 
— the daunting, preeminent world 
of its own to which she looked 
forward for so many years.
Canfield wasted no time getting 
her feet wet. Just a few pitches into 
her plate appearance, she uncorked 
a powerful swing. When the ball 
landed on the other side of the 
outfield wall, she began her home 
run trot — the first of many to come.
For Canfield, that trot took the 
world off her shoulders. It reminded 
her that she was still playing the 
same game she excelled at her whole 
life. According to Ramirez, it taught 
Canfield not to make too big a deal 
out of the new level.
After her mindset fell into place, 
the rest of her game followed suit.
“(Canfield’s) realization that she 

had so much potential and that she 
is such a good player was huge,” 
Falk said. “Once she became aware 
of that, it allowed her to help her 
teammates rise up, too. As a player, 
making your teammates around you 
better is one of the best qualities you 
can have. She made the team better 
as a whole.
“She’s very mature. I was very 
impressed with the way she played. 
She didn’t play like a freshman. She 
played like a seasoned player at the 
plate and on the field.”
After shedding the misconception 
that the college level would be 
drastically different from high 
school or travel ball, Canfield came 
into her own. Everyone on the field 
took notice.
So, this was college softball.
***
Unlike 
most 
top 
recruits, 
Canfield’s name wasn’t initially 
on the starting lineup card in 
2016. Little did she know, the role 
that awaited her would be just as 
beneficial in the long run.
Now 
in 
her 
35th 
season, 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
knows a starter when she sees 
one. To this day, Hutchins believes 
Canfield could’ve cracked almost 
any starting lineup in the country as 
a freshman. But for the Wolverines, 

there was no doubt that then-senior 
and eventual National Player of the 
Year Sierra Romero would be the 
starting second baseman during 
Canfield’s first season.
“There’s no one better to play 
behind,” Canfield said. “Nobody’s 
going to beat out Sierra Romero, but 
I was working that hard everyday to 
try.”
Even so, Canfield worked her 
way into the lineup. According 
to Ramirez, she began her career 
ahead of the curve. It was an open 
secret that she’d be the heir to 
Romero’s throne at second base the 
following season, but Canfield still 
started 33 of the team’s 59 games as 
a freshman — 22 as the designated 
player, eight at third base and three 
at second base.
Canfield 
seized 
the 
chance 
to spend a year learning under 
Romero. Each day of practice 
provided a new opportunity to 
learn from the best, and, as a result, 
Romero took her under her wing. 
That season, Romero posted a .451 
batting average and 79 RBI en route 
to 2016 National Player of the Year 
honors. Canfield diligently watched 
every moment of it.
