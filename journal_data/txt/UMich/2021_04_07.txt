ANN ARBOR
Hash Bash marks 50 years of progress 
with both virtual, in-person events
Festival hosts live-streamed variety show, “smoke-in” on Diag 

JARETT ORR/Daily

Though some organizers encouraged Hash Bash participants to tune in virtually from their homes, hundreds came to the Diag for an in-person smoke-in. 

In light of the ongoing COVID-

19 pandemic, the annual Hash 
Bash festival — now in its 50th 
consecutive year — hosted a live-
streamed variety show featuring 
key political figures, athletes, 
musicians, business owners and 
other prominent voices in the 
pro-cannabis movement. 

In accordance with public 

health guidelines, the organizers 
of 
Hash 
Bash 
encouraged 

participants to celebrate the 
festival from the comfort of 
their own homes. Despite these 
efforts, some enthusiasts took 
the initiative to host an in-person 
smoke-in on the Diag, Hash 
Bash’s birthplace. 

For any other pre-pandemic 

year, thousands of marijuana 
activists, 
protesters 
and 

enthusiasts from across the globe 
travel to Ann Arbor to light a joint 
while advocating for marijuana 
legislation 
and 
celebrating 

cannabis culture. Last year’s rally 
was held completely online after 
the COVID-19 pandemic shut 
down in-person activity. 

In Nov. 2018, the state of 

Michigan passed Proposal I, 
making it legal for those 21 and 
older to possess up to 2.5 ounces 
of 
recreational 
marijuana. 

Michigan was the first state in the 
Midwest to legalize recreational 
marijuana, following other states 
like California, Arizona, Maine, 
Massachusetts and Nevada. 

Both 
the 
in-person 
and 

virtual events commemorated 
the 
cannabis 
movement’s 

achievements while advocating 
for 
progressive 
marijuana 

legislation on the federal level.

The festival first began in 1972, 

four months after a freedom rally 
in protest of the conviction of 
longtime activist and poet John 
Sinclair, whom the Michigan 
Supreme Court sentenced to 9.5 
to 10 years for the possession 
of two marijuana joints in 1971. 
Sinclair organized the first Hash 
Bash in protest of the Controlled 
Substances 
Act. 
Since 
then, 

Hash Bash has transformed into 
a large-scale festival drawing 
in social activists and cannabis 
enthusiasts from all across the 
state and country. 

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily prior to the event, 
Adam Rosenberg, University of 
Michigan Business School alum 
and founder of Green Wolverine 
— an organization dedicated to 
exploring the cannabis industry 
— echoed the importance of 
federal decriminalization and 

legalization. 

When 
discussing 
his 

expectations 
for 
the 
event, 

Rosenberg 
said 
he 
hoped 

policymakers 
in 
attendance 

would promote further access to 
cannabis research and support 
for the SAFE Banking Act, which 
would allow cannabis companies 
to receive the same financial 
services and public listings as 
non-cannabis companies.

“Most 
importantly, 
there 

needs to be an elimination of the 
contradiction between state law 
and federal law through federal 
decriminalization, which would 
eliminate the current law that 
essentially 
equates 
cannabis 

with 
heroin 
at 
the 
federal 

level,” Rosenberg said. “This 
conversation needs to come from 
our federal leadership.”

The Network for the Ongoing 

Reconsideration 
of 
Our 

Nomenclature (NoRon), a newly 
formed group of University of 
Michigan community members, 
hosted a “Satirical Creative 
Intervention” at Weiser Center 
April 3. At the event, NoRon 
members chalked and posted a 
sign in front of the Weiser Hall 
sign reading “Weiser Center 
for Voter Suppression, Political 
Assassination 
and 
Witch 

Burning.”

The event was in response 

to Regent Ron Weiser’s (R) 
referral of three of Michigan’s 
Democratic 
leaders 
— 

presumably 
Gov. 
Gretchen 

Whitmer, Secretary of State 
Jocelyn Benson and Attorney 
General Dana Nessel — as the 
“three witches” at a meeting at 
the North Oakland Republican 
Club on March 25. Weiser also 
referenced 
the 
assassination 

attempt 
on 
Whitmer 
when 

answering a question about how 
the Republican party voting out 
the “witches” Weiser previously 
referred to.

The NoRon event came one 

day after an emergency Regents 

meeting on April 2 where regents 
voted 5-0-2 to censure Weiser 
for his misogynistic remarks. 

The group assembled in front 

of the Weiser Hall at 3 p.m. 
with free-standing signs and 
staged a “mock inauguration” by 
cutting an inaugural ribbon and 
covering up the “Weiser Hall” 
sign with a sign reading “Weiser 
Center for Voter Suppression, 
Political 
Assassination 
and 

Witch 
Burning.” 
Assemblers 

included 
members 
of 
the 

Graduate 
Employees’ 

Organization, 
Lecturers’ 

Employee Organization, Public 
Health junior Nithya Arun and 
Engineering junior Carla Voigt 
— the newly elected Central 
Student Government president 
and 
vice 
president 
— 
and 

numerous students, faculty and 
staff. 

In a press release, NoRon 

wrote Weiser’s comments were 
misogynistic, violent and anti-
democratic. The group further 
emphasized that though they 
support the calls for Weiser’s 
resignation, 
the 
University 

needs 
to 
begin 
renaming 

buildings associated with his 
name.

Regents vote to censure 
Weiser, call for resignation
The 5-0-2 vote, a first in the board’s history, condemns 
MI GOP leader for violent and misogynistic remarks

ADMINISTRATION

The Board of Regents voted 

5-0-2 April 2 to censure Regent 
Ron Weiser (R) for misogynistic 
and hateful remarks he made to 
the North Oakland Republic Club 
on March 25. Chairwoman Denise 
Ilitch (D) also removed Weiser 
from his committee assignments at 
the meeting.

Weiser came under fire for 

calling the state’s top Democrats 
— 
presumably 
Gov. 
Gretchen 

Whitmer, Attorney General Dana 
Nessel and Secretary of State 
Jocelyn Benson — “witches” and 
referencing assassination when 
talking 
about 
two 
Michigan 

Republican 
Congressmen 
who 

voted to impeach former President 
Donald Trump. Though he at 
first repeatedly downplayed his 
comments, after a steady stream of 
officials criticized his remarks or 
called for his resignation, Weiser 
apologized in a March 27 statement 
in which he committed to being 
“part of a respectful political 
dialogue going forward.”

Regent Katherine White (D) 

was not at the meeting due to her 
service in the National Guard and 
did not vote. All other Regents, 

including Weiser, were present at 
the meeting, but Weiser and Regent 
Sarah Hubbard (R) abstained from 
voting.

Ilitch put forth a resolution 

“condemn(ing) in the strongest 
possible language the behavior 
of Regent Weiser, his language, 
and the actions taken therein, 
and call(ing) on Regent Weiser to 
resign from the Board of Regents 
forthwith.”

After Ilitch introduced the 

resolution, Weiser commented on 
it, apologizing for his comments 
while rejecting calls to resign.

“I take full responsibility for 

what I said,” Weiser said. “I agree 
with part of this resolution, but 
I will not resign… I will not be 
canceled.”

In 
his 
remarks, 
Regent 

Jordan Acker (D), vice chair of 
the Board, gave a statement in 
which he echoed earlier concerns 
lambasting Weiser’s conduct.

“I believe in forgiveness for you 

and anyone else,” Acker said. “But 
there is no room on this Board 
for those who advocate violence. 
Make no mistake: That is precisely 
what you did. You have forced this 
Board to take this painful and 
permanent step, to condemn one of 
our own.” 

Weiser’s conduct has sparked 

multiple controversies during the 

winter semester. After Weiser 
declined 
to 
condemn 
then-

President 
Donald 
Trump 
for 

inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection, 
members of the U-M community 
launched a petition calling for 
Weiser’s resignation. In response, 
Weiser emailed his fellow regents 
for support, imploring them to 
“Remember 
Germany 
in 
the 

1930’s.”

Though some U-M students and 

faculty have called for Weiser’s 
resignation since January, the last 
week of March marked the first 
time some Regents and University 
President Mark Schlissel have 
publicly criticized Weiser.

Prior to the April 2 meeting, 

Regents Acker, Mark Bernstein 
(D), Mike Behm (D) and Paul 
Brown (D) have previously urged 
Weiser to resign. Other members 
of the board, including Ilitch and 
Schlissel, were highly critical of 
Weiser’s remarks but stopped 
short of calling for his resignation. 
Eight former Regents called on 
Weiser to resign in a statement 
released April 1. 

In a prepared statement to the 

board, Acker repeated his belief 
that Weiser should no longer serve 
as a regent.

Michigan residents 16 and older 
became eligible for the vaccine 
Monday. Some U-M students 
have already been vaccinated
Undergraduates find various ways to obtain COVID-19 shot

VACCINE

Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer 

announced 
March 
12 
that 

vaccine eligibility in Michigan 
will expand to those ages 16 
and older beginning on April 5, 
shortly after President Joe Biden 
announced on March 11 that all 
U.S. adults will be eligible for a 
vaccine starting May 1. 

Many University of Michigan 

students, however, have been 
able to get vaccinated earlier, 
because some were eligible to 
receive the shot, some clinics 
offered spare doses and since 
many slipped through eligibility 
requirements.

Risk 
of 
severe 
illness, 

hospitalization and death from 
COVID-19 increases with age, 
according to the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention. 
Protecting those at the highest 
risk is a top priority, according 
to the Michigan Department 
of Health and Human Services 
vaccine prioritization guidance. 
As of April 2, according to the 
Washtenaw 
County 
Health 

Department website, 80.2% of 
residents ages 65 and older in the 

county have received at least one 
dose of vaccine.

Before April 5, the only people 

who were not eligible to receive 
a vaccine were those under the 
age of 49 who are not essential/
frontline workers, do not have 
underlying medical conditions or 
disabilities or are not caregiver 
family members or guardians 
to someone who has medical 
conditions or disabilities.

Yet, 
some 
U-M 
students 

found available doses before 
April 5 eligibility, similar to 
situations 
reported 
at 
other 

college campuses, such as Purdue 
University. According to the 
MDHHS vaccine prioritization 
guidance, those 50 and older with 
underlying health or medical 
conditions as well as caregivers 
16 and older became eligible for 
the vaccine on March 8, while 
anyone 50 or older as well as 
those 16 to 49 with underlying 
health conditions became eligible 
March 22.

LSA junior Lauren Thom said 

she received the Pfizer vaccine on 
March 25 at Ford Field in Detroit. 
Thom works at Beyond Juicery 
and Eatery in Ann Arbor, where 
she prepares food for customers.

“My friend, he was out of 

town at the time, texted me and 
said, ‘Would you be able to get a 
vaccine on this day?’ and I was 
like ‘Yeah, of course,’” Thom 
said. “He wasn’t able to use his 
vaccine appointment because he 
was out of town.”

MDHHS 
vaccine 

prioritization guidelines state 
that by March 1, areas in 
Michigan that had vaccines 
available were able to begin 
vaccinating frontline essential 
workers in the food service and 
agricultural industries. 

Thom, who had no reaction 

to being vaccinated, said getting 
vaccinated was the “safe and 
smart thing to do” so that 
everyone can return to a more 
normal lifestyle and be able to 
see friends and family again.

“My behavior hasn’t really 

changed yet just because I 
know I’m not fully vaccinated,” 
Thom said. “I’m not at the point 
where I have the best chance of 
not getting (COVID-19). So my 
behavior hasn’t changed, but I 
do feel a bit safer going into the 
grocery store or for those other 
essential outings.”

ANN ARBOR
Take Back the Night rally seeks to raise 
awareness of sexual violence, calls for action
Event returned in-person for 43rd annual protest on behalf of survivors

On an unseasonably brisk 

Thursday night, Take Back 
the Night Ann Arbor — an 
organization 
dedicated 
to 

advocating for survivors of 
sexual violence — hosted its 
43rd annual rally April 2 to 
educate community members 
on sexual violence and to 
encourage action.

About 50 student volunteers 

and 
community 
members 

donning purple “Take Back 
the Night” sweatshirts and 
bundled up scarves and mittens 
formed 
a 
loose 
semicircle 

before the steps of Hatcher 
Graduate Library to begin the 
rally. A Youtube live stream 
of the event was also made 
available to allow visibility for 
those unable to attend due to 
COVID-19 restrictions. 

Pam Swider, Take Back the 

Night Ann Arbor community 
leader, told the crowd that 
this year marks her 13th year 
running the annual rally and 
march. As a survivor of sexual 
violence 
herself, 
Swider 
is 

also the founder and executive 
director of Standing Tough 
Against Rape Society. 

Swider works directly with 

University 
Students 
Against 

Rape, 
an 
organization 
on 

campus 
aimed 
at 
raising 

awareness of sexual assault 
and violence through rallies, 
marches 
and 
prevention 

events. She was also involved 
in acquiring a city permit to 
march Thursday evening amid 
the 
pandemic 
and 
ensured 

COVID-19 safety precautions 
were followed by volunteers 
and attendees. 

“I 
started 
becoming 
so 

concerned 
because 
I 
knew 

how it was affecting survivors, 
especially 
those 
who 
have 

to spend the pandemic with 
their perpetrators, or around 
people who have no idea how 
to 
support 
them,” 
Swider 

said in an interview with The 
Michigan 
Daily 
before 
the 

event. 

According to a Centers for 

Disease Control and Prevention 
report, one in five women 
and one in 38 men experience 

completed or attempted rape 
in their lifetime in the United 
States. The report also found 
that one in three women and 
one in four men experience at 
least one incident of some form 
of sexual violence in their lives. 

26.4% 
of 
undergraduate 

women experience rape or 
sexual 
assault, 
according 

to the Rape, Abuse & Incest 
National 
Network. 
Swider 

said 
marginalized 
groups, 

such as people of color — in 
particular Black women — and 
the LGBTQ+ community need 
allies and supporters in the 
fight against sexual violence. 

“We 
need 
to 
use 
the 

privileges that we have to 
speak when they can’t,” Swider 
said. “We need to let them 
know that they are not alone.” 

Because 
of 
the 

intensification of sexual and 
domestic 
violence 
against 

women during the pandemic, 
Swider 
said 
she 
found 
it 

incredibly important to try to 
make this an in-person event 
after last year’s virtual rally. 
Considering how quarantine 
and physical isolation have had 
a negative impact on domestic 
violence in the past year due 
to individuals being forced to 
stay home with their abusers, 
Swider said Take Back the 
Night Ann Arbor decided on 
the theme “take action” for 
this year. 

Recent 
University 
alum 

Emma Wellman was a student 
leader who helped organize 
this event, ensure distancing 
guidelines were followed and 
raise funding for the speakers’ 
equipment. 

Though adjusting to the 

pandemic was a challenge, 
Wellman said she was proud of 
the adaptability and progress 
she made alongside her team 
members 
throughout 
the 

past year to successfully put 
together a safe in-person rally.

”What I’m most proud of 

is 
everybody 
really 
came 

together,” Wellman said. “My 
biggest hope is just that people 
feel really empowered.”

USAR 
student 
leader 

Kaitlyn Colyer, LSA junior, 
said adjusting to a virtual 
environment 
and 
in-person 

restrictions this year required 
a lot of planning on how to still 

make the event impactful.

“This issue very much still 

matters,” Coyler said. “We’re 
seeing it in the news today that 
sexual violence is something 
that happens to everyone, and 
it doesn’t matter your identity. 
So it’s important to us that 
we’re uplifting survivor voices 
and also making them stand 
against what’s going on.”

Nicole Denson, event MC 

and 
MOSAIC 
Collective 

Consulting, 
LLC 
founder, 

spoke to the crowd about 
how Take Back the Night has 
become a global movement 
to 
raise 
awareness 
around 

the 
prevalence 
of 
sexual 

violence while also providing 
a forum for survivors of sexual 
violence. 

Denson 
said 
she 
still 

remembers 
her 
first 
Take 

Back the Night when she was 
a student at Michigan State 
University, 
which 
helped 

launch her passion for activism. 

“I saw people being brave 

and 
speaking 
their 
truth,” 

Denson said. “And from where 
I came, that was something 
that I could only dream about. 
And that was the start of my 
activism.”

Ann 
Arbor 
Mayor 

Christopher Taylor also spoke 
at the event, saying that the city 
plans to declare a proclamation 
that says April will now be 
Sexual 
Assault 
Awareness 

Month in Ann Arbor. 

“We 
support 
survivors 

everywhere,” Taylor said. “We 
(want to) ensure that those 
who choose to come forward 
are treated with seriousness 
and 
compassion. 
Sexual 

harassment and violence by 
men burdens and devastates 
the lives of women and girls 
and children every single day.”

Karasten Birge, also on the 

STARS board of directors, 
explained 
how 
her 
own 

experiences 
as 
a 
survivor 

inspired her to help create 
the new program “Sweaters 
for Survivors,” which donates 
comfortable clothes and other 
personal care items that will 
then be provided to examiners 
to give to survivors to wear 
home. 

Birge shared that after she 

was sexually assaulted, she 
was brought to the hospital and 
asked to provide her statement 
multiple times, making her 
uncomfortable. 

“I 
was 
given 
disposable 

scratchy 
hospital 
scrubs,” 

Birge said. “I had no bra or 
underwear. It would be nice 
for a hospital to be able to 
give 
survivors 
something 

warm 
to 
put 
on 
like 
a 

sweatshirt, sweatpants, new 
undergarments 
and 
a 
care 

package with soap, toothbrush 
or toothpaste. Those are the 
little things that are big things 
after going through something 
so awful.” 

STARS is partnering with 

St. Joseph Mercy Ann Arbor in 
Washtenaw County and Avalon 

Healing 
Center 
in 
Wayne 

County to create “Sweatshirts 
for Survivors.”

“This will give them back 

some dignity and grace they 
so desperately deserve after 
making that brave choice to 
just get justice for the violence 
that was committed against 
them,” Swider said.

The rally’s keynote speaker 

was feminist author Jaclyn 
Friedman, 
who 
shared 
a 

prerecorded 
Zoom 
message 

about her experiences with 
advocacy and gave advice to 
the 
audience 
on 
authentic 

leadership and activism for 
survivors. 

“We want to be really, really 

clear about something (about) 
being a survivor,” Friedman 
said. “It doesn’t obligate you to 
anything. So, you don’t have to 
do or be any kind of way to be a 
valid, important survivor who 
is worthy of love and justice 
and care.”

Friedman also said there 

are many ways to help uplift 
sexual 
violence 
survivors, 

specifically finding a smaller 
sub-issue that is more feasible 
to tackle. She gave advice on 
how to effectively take care of 
mental health concerns that 
come with a sensitive topic like 
sexual violence. 

“It’s so important for all 

of us to make time to rest for 
healing for self-care, yes, but 
also community care when 
we take care of each other,” 
Friedman said. “We all grow 
stronger together, rest and heal 
and take care of each other and 
ourselves.” 

Armed with bucket drums, 

megaphones and homemade 
signs, students and community 
members first marched west 
on South University Avenue 
towards State Street. Police 
in 
cars 
and 
motorcycles 

bookended 
the 
protestors, 

flashing blue and red lights. 

Students took turns leading 

chants, such as “What do we 
want? Safe streets! When do we 
want it? Now!” As the crowd 
began turning north on State 
St., another chant rang out: 
“However we dress, wherever 
we go, yes means yes, No 
means no!” When the march 
reached 
Williams 
St., 
the 

crowd held a moment of silence 
for victims of sexual assault. 
Afterward, 
the 
protestors 

resumed chanting ”2,4,6,8 No 
more violence, no more hate!”

When addressing the crowd, 

Swider discussed what she 
hopes participants take away 
from the rally.

“We 
hope 
that 
we 
can 

educate you and inspire you, 
empower you,” Swider said. 
“And for those of you who are 
survivors, let you know that 
healing is possible and that you 
are never alone.”

Ann Arbor City Council convened 

virtually April 5 to discuss the 
development of an unarmed safety 
response team, support for the 
University of Michigan’s President’s 
Commission on Carbon Neutrality, 
an amendment to the housing rental 
period and a resolution to condemn 
anti-Asian hate crimes. 

The council discussed DC-3, a 

resolution that would task the city 
administrator with investigating 
different pathways for developing an 
unarmed first responder program 
for mental health crises within the 
Ann Arbor community. According 
to the proposal, police officers are 
currently responding in situations 
that would be better handled by 
trained mental health, public health 
and human services professionals.

“We ask our police to do too 

much in our community that they 
are called upon to do things where 
they do not have expertise,” Mayor 
Christopher Taylor said. “And yet, 
there are subject matter experts 
among us — that is to say there are 

mental health experts and staff 
among us, there are human services 
experts among us, public health 
experts among us.”

Ann Arbor resident Paul Fleming 

spoke in support of the resolution, 
saying it is a decision supported by 
evidence and is a step in the right 
direction toward supporting those 
going through mental health crises.

“Rethinking how we approach 

public safety so we don’t rely on 
police is in-line with evidence 
based public health best practices,” 
Fleming said. “Current policing 
practices have spillover effects on 
entire communities, particularly 
communities 
of 
color, 
making 

people who live in areas that are 
aggressively policed more likely to 
suffer mental health issues and have 
physical health ailments.”

Many other councilmembers also 

expressed their enthusiasm for the 
resolution, citing examples around 
the country where unarmed first 
responders could have prevented 
a deadly outcome and instances of 
police brutality. 

“This program is far overdue 

and it has serious needs and 
consequences,” Councilmember Ali 
Ramlawi, D-Ward 5, said. “A call 

to the police should not be the last 
call you make when you’re calling 
for help. And unfortunately, for a lot 
of people it is—with mental illness 
or struggling with something they 
could easily be helped with.”

The council also noted specifics 

not addressed within the resolution, 
including lack of knowledge about 
where funding would come from. 
At a March 16 meeting, City Council 
had voted to use revenue from 
recreational marijuana excise taxes 
to fund social equity programs that 
support individuals impacted by the 
“War on Drugs.”

Leading up to Monday’s vote, 

many 
community 
members, 

including the Washtenaw County-
based advocacy group Liberate 
Don’t 
Incarcerate, 
expressed 

concerns that the program could be 
tied to the police department despite 
the fact that it would serve as an 
alternative to policing and had asked 
for the resolution to be delayed.

City 
Administrator 
Tom 

Crawford said the process of 
exploring options would entail 
a more thorough investigation 
into 
where 
to 
get 
funding. 

Councilmembers 
also 
stressed 

to Crawford the importance of 

community engagement in this 
process.

“I think this is a huge effort that 

we’re undertaking and we need to 
be thinking about what those costs 
are right now, and that there should 
be something in our budget that 
we’re adopting if we’re serious about 
this,” Councilmember Erica Briggs, 
D-Ward 5, said.

One 
of 
Liberate 
Don’t 

Incarcerate’s reasons for wanting 
the resolution tabled was that they 
felt there had not been “meaningful 
participation” with community-led 
groups.

The council unanimously voted 

to pass the DC-3 resolution.

The 
council 
also 
discussed 

another 
resolution, 
DC-2, 

that 
supports 
the 
PCCN’s 

recommendations to reach carbon 
neutrality for direct emissions 
across all three campuses by 2025, 
though with the controversial use of 
carbon offsets. 

In 2019, University President 

Mark Schlissel announced the 
creation of the PCCN with the goal 
of reducing carbon emissions put 
out by the University and ultimately 
achieving carbon neutrality. The 
announcement came in response 

to sustained community activism 
that put pressure on the University 
to commit to achieving carbon 
neutrality. After the PCCN was 
created, student activists continued 
to protest for greater transparency, 
leading 10 students to be arrested for 
trespassing.

In December 2020, the PCCN 

proposed a series of actions and 
recommendations for public review 
and commentary. This public review 
concluded in February 2021 when 
the commission finalized their 
recommendations and submitted 
it to Schlissel and the Board of 
Regents for approval. At a March 
25 Board of Regents meeting, the 
University voted to disinvest in fossil 
fuel companies and committed to a 
net-zero investment portfolio by 
2050, again after years of activism 
from campus groups.

According to Melissa Stults, 

Ann Arbor’s sustainability and 
innovations manager as well as a 
PCCN member, the city’s goal to 
reach carbon neutrality by 2030 uses 
carbon offsets and indirect carbon 
emissions because Ann Arbor does 
not have the resources to make a 
complete change in infrastructure. 

“The city doesn’t have all of 

the levers in our disposal to be 
able to do things like, remove 
all gas stations or all natural gas 
connections that exist within 
homes or within businesses,” 
Stults said. “And so offsets became 
part of the conversation from a 
more rational interpreting role.” 

Stults said the city is attempting 

to achieve as close to carbon 
neutrality as possible, but offsets 
will still be part of the equation. 

Councilmember Jeff Hayner, 

D Ward-1, raised concerns about 
how 
supporting 
the 
PCCN’s 

proposals correlates with Ann 
Arbor’s goals as a city. Hayner said 
members of Washtenaw350, an 
environmental organization, have 
reached out asking for the council 
to not support this bill in protest, 
saying the PCCN’s proposal is not 
enough to truly address climate 
change.

“(Washtenaw350) 
folks 
have 

been reaching out to me saying, 
‘Please don’t say yes to this because 
we don’t feel it’s strong enough, and 
we don’t know enough about their 
solutions,’” Hayner said. 

On March 31, the University 

of Michigan Board of Regents 
scheduled a special meeting for 
April 2 to vote on whether to 
censure one of their own, Regent 
Ron Weiser (R). Though a censure 
would signal that the Board 
condemns Weiser’s actions and 
deems him unfit for office, it is 
largely a symbolic move. No public 
commenters will be allowed at the 
meeting.

Ahead of this unusual meeting, 

The Michigan Daily explains how 
the administration has reached 
this point by recapping various 
controversies Weiser has been 
embroiled 
in 
throughout 
the 

semester, as well as listing those 
who have criticized or called for 
Weiser’s resignation as of April 1.

What has happened over the past 

few months?

Friday, 
Jan. 
8: 
University 

community members called for 
Weiser’s resignation in a petition 
and open letter, due to his failure 
to specifically denounce former 
President 
Donald 
Trump 
for 

inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol riots in an 
interview with Bridge Michigan. 

Wednesday, Feb. 3: The Daily 

reported that Weiser sent emails 
to 
fellow 
regents 
comparing 

their silence amid calls for his 
resignation to “Germany in the 
1930s,” describing graduate student 
protesters as “hired union hacks” 
and sending a message with only a 
picture of a bikini-clad woman. 

Thursday, Feb. 4: Weiser was 

accused 
by 
former 
Michigan 

GOP Chair Laura Cox of making 
undisclosed payments of $200,000 
to a former candidate for secretary 
of state in hopes he would withdraw 
his candidacy. Weiser has denied 
these accusations.

Saturday, Feb. 6: For a third 

non-consecutive 
term, 
Weiser 

was elected chair of the Michigan 
Republican Party despite Cox’s 
accusations. He won more than 
66% of the vote during the 2021 
virtual MI GOP convention. 

Thursday, March 25: At a 

meeting of the North Oakland 
Republican Club, Weiser referred 
to 
presumably 
Gov. 
Gretchen 

Whitmer, 
Michigan 
Attorney 

General Dana Nessel and Michigan 
Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson 
as “the three witches” and made 
a comment about burning them 
at the stake. He also referenced 
“assassination” when discussing 
the reelection of two Michigan 
Republican 
Congressmen 
who 

voted 
to 
impeach 
Trump 
in 

January. 

For more information on past 

controversies surrounding Weiser, 
read The Michigan Daily’s fact or 
fiction analysis from February.

What has Weiser’s response 

been?

In response to the criticism of his 
response to the Jan. 6 Capitol riots, 

Weiser told Bridge Michigan on 
January 7 he had undergone oral 
surgery earlier in the day and so 

was not aware of the situation in the 
Capitol when he was first contacted 

by the media.

Weiser has made no public 

statements about his inappropriate 
emails to other regents.

When 
accused 
of 
making 

undisclosed 
payments, 
Weiser 

denied the claims and said he did not 
violate any law. 

“Laura Cox’s baseless allegations 

are a desperate attempt to smear 
my name, based on a longstanding 
political grudge, and her inability 
to hold onto the job of party chair 
that she could not keep on her 
own merits,” Weiser wrote. “I’m 
disappointed by Laura’s shameful 
attempt to destroy our party with 
unfounded and reckless conspiracy 
theories so that she can get back 
in the chair’s race and save her 
paycheck.” 

While initially defending his 

comments about Whitmer, Nessel, 
Benson and Reps. Fred Upton (R) 
and Peter Meijer (R), Weiser said 
they were taken “out of context.” 
He later released a more apologetic 
statement on March 27 saying 
he would be “part of a respectful 
political dialogue going forward.”

Weiser deleted his personal 

Twitter account last week, and 
his email was removed from the 
University Board of Regents website.

 
What’s could happen moving 

forward? 

Because Weiser is an elected 

official, in order for him to be 
recalled from office, Benson would 
have to file an official petition. No 
later than 25 days following the 
filing of the petition, Benson would 
then have to declare if the petition 
has enough signatures for a recall or 
not. To trigger a recall election, the 
number of signatures on the petition 
needs to equal 25% of votes cast 
by Michigan residents in the 2020 
general election.

As of April 1, who has called for 

Weiser’s resignation?

• Four University Regents 
Regents Jordan Acker (D), Mark 

Bernstein 
(D), 
Michael 
Behm 

(D) and Paul Brown (D) have all 
issued statements urging Weiser to 
resign. Despite criticism from the 
University community of Weiser 
for months, Weiser’s fellow regents 
had not previously criticized him 
publicly. 

“So, particularly at this moment 

in our history when such extreme 
rhetoric from too many political 
leaders has sewn deep division 
in society, hurt individuals, and 
threatened our democracy, I can 

only come to the conclusion that 
any 
official, 
including 
Regent 

Weiser, who would unrepentantly 
engage in such speech should not 
remain in public office, especially 
at an institution like the University 
of Michigan, which so values 
upholding gender equality and 
protection 
of 
women’s 
rights,” 

Brown wrote in his statement. 

• The Lecturers’ Employee 

Organization 

LEO, 
a 
union 
representing 

lecturers 
who 
work 
at 
the 

University’s 
three 
campuses, 

demanded Weiser resign from 
the Board of Regents in a public 
statement issued March 31. 

The 
group 
expressed 

concern over Weiser’s history of 
controversial behavior but said his 
most recent comments at the North 
Oakland Republican Club meeting 
were particularly problematic. 

“The threats of violence towards 

five democratically elected officials 
are particularly abhorrent and have 
no place in a university dedicated to 
the open pursuit of ideas,” LEO said 
in their statement. “In addition, Mr. 
Weiser’s misogynistic statements 
about the top three elected officials 
of Michigan directly violate the 
University’s core commitments to 
diversity, equity, and inclusion.”

If Weiser refuses to resign, 

LEO requests that the University 
remove Weiser from all Regent 
activities and remove his name 
from any University buildings — 
he is currently the namesake of 
the Weiser Center for Emerging 
Democracies, housed in Weiser 
Hall, due to his numerous donations 
to the University. 

• The Graduate Employees’ 

Organization

GEO first called for Weiser to 

resign in their Michigan Daily 
op-ed from February 1, which said 
Weiser should step down “due to 
his fundamental conflicts of interest 
and immoral conduct regarding the 
Capitol riot.”

GEO criticized Weiser’s recent 

comments in a tweet on March 26. 

“Bad look Regent Weiser!” GEO 

said in a retweet of the breaking 
news about Weiser’s misogynistic 
and violent comments.

• Political opponents and 

public officials 

The Michigan Democratic Party 

released a statement demanding 
Weiser resign as regent in a March 
26 tweet. Whitmer, Nessel and 
Benson — all of whom were assumed 
to be referenced in Weiser’s most 
recent comments — tweeted or 
released statements in response. 

State 
Rep. 
Donna 
Lasinski, 

D-Novi, 
Michigan 
House 

Democratic leader, called on Weiser 
to resign from the University 
Board of Regents in a letter to 
regents March 31. Five other state 
representatives and one additional 
state senator — including State Rep. 
Yousef Rabhi, D-Ann Arbor, and 
state Sen. Jeff Irwin, D-Ann Arbor 
— signed the letter, which was 

written on behalf of all Democratic 
legislators in the Michigan House of 
Representatives. 

“Ron 
Weiser’s 
sexist 
and 

markedly dangerous comments are 
not only terribly inappropriate, they 
also serve to damage the reputation 
of the University of Michigan. His 
choice of words and actions have 
betrayed the trust that was given 
to him when he was elected to the 
University of Michigan Board of 
Regents,” the letter reads. “As a 
collective body of elected officials, 
we officially call on Ron Weiser 
to resign immediately from the 
University of Michigan Board of 
Regents.”

• The Senate Advisory 

Committee on University Affairs 

SACUA released a statement 

March 29 criticizing Weiser’s use of 
sexist and violent language, calling 
his comments “a betrayal of the 
trust our community — students, 
faculty and staff — places on Regent 
Weiser.” While the statement does 
not explicitly call for Weiser to 
resign, it implies it by questioning 
his role as a leader on campus. 

“SACUA believes strongly and 

without any hesitation that Regent 
Weiser cannot be an effective leader 
in our community,” the statement 
reads. 

• Central Student Government
In a statement released March 29, 

former Central Student Government 
President 
and 
Vice 
President 

Amanda 
Kaplan 
and 
Saveri 

Nandigama, 
alongside 
current 

President and Vice President Nithya 
Arun and Carla Voigt, called on 
the rest of the regents to denounce 
Weiser’s actions and call for his 
resignation. 

“We stand with the six women 

deans, and their allies, who released 
a statement yesterday condemning 
Regent 
Weiser’s 
actions,” 
the 

statement reads. “We urge the 
remaining members of the Board 
of Regents to also condemn his 
remarks and join their peers in 
calling for his resignation. We 
deserve better.”

CSG first called for Weiser’s 

resignation following the attempted 
insurrection at the Capitol with a 
resolution introduced Feb. 3 and 
passed Feb. 17.

• Student-created petition
U-M 
community 
members 

created a petition following the Jan. 
6 Capitol riots calling for Weiser’s 
resignation, which has garnered 
over 6,300 signatures as of April 1. 
The petition was updated on March 
26 with Weiser’s recent comments.

“This sexist, violent rhetoric 

has no place at the University of 
Michigan or amongst its leadership,” 
the petition says. “We loudly 
reaffirm our demand that he resign, 
and we expect President Schlissel to 
condemn this threat to all students 
of color on campus.” 

• Faculty open letter
Hundreds of faculty signed an 

open letter released in early January 
that asked Weiser to resign due to 

his involvement in the Michigan 
GOP and initial failure to respond 
to the Jan. 6 Capitol riots. The letter 
states that Weiser’s role as GOP 
chair is directly at odds with his 
duties as regent. 

“In sum, the MI-GOP’s current 

political 
program 
depends 
on 

empowering factions and candidates 
that seek to impede or even overturn 
basic democratic principles, that 
seek to exclude Black, Indigenous, 
and other non-white residents 
from political participation, and 
that pursue their political goals 
without regard to truth, honesty, 
or integrity,” the letter reads. “You 
have to choose between supporting 
the University of Michigan and 
supporting the darkest factions 
of US political life. You cannot do 
both.”

• Eight former regents
Eight former regents signed a 

letter April 1 calling on Weiser to 
resign, saying they were “appalled 
to hear” that Weiser had advocated 
for violence and used misogynistic 
language 
when 
referring 
to 

Whitmer, Nessel and Benson. The 
letter, a copy of which was obtained 
by The Daily, states that while the 
First Amendment guarantees right 
to freedom of speech, it does not 
excuse violent language.

“That doesn’t mean that if he 

believes that he is free to denigrate 
women with whom he disagrees 
by calling them ‘witches’ and if he 
encourages assassination as a way 
to deal with honorable men of his 
own party with whom he disagrees 
he should retain the privilege of 
remaining a fiduciary for a great 
university,” the letter reads. “That is 
why we are joining many others in 
calling for his resignation.”

Who has condemned Weiser’s 
statements but stopped short of 

calling for resignation?

• Regent Denise Ilitch (D)
In an email to The Daily, Regent 

Denise 
Ilitch 
(D) 
expressed 

disappointment 
over 
Weiser’s 

recent statements but did not call for 
his resignation. 

“Despite any differences among 

its eight members elected by the 
State’s voters, we have worked 
constructively on advancing the 
institution 
without 
destructive 

politics getting in the way,” Ilitch 
said. “That is why it is so disturbing 
to learn of the repugnant language 
used by a member of our Board 
when addressing a political group. 
His use of violent imagery crosses 
a line that is inconsistent with what 
should be our shared values. There 
should be no place for physical 
threats by elected or political leaders 
on our Board or in our State.”

• University President Mark 

Schlissel

Schlissel issued a statement 

April 
27 
condemning 
Weiser’s 

remarks, though he did not call 
for his resignation. Schlissel has 
not previously criticized Weiser’s 

controversial actions.

“Such words are particularly 

abhorrent in a climate where so 
recently the use of language has 
engendered violence and attempted 
violence directed at elected officials, 
our democratic institutions, and 
the individuals who guard them,” 
Schlissel’s statement said. “It is never 
appropriate to raise the specter 
of 
assassination 
or 
perpetuate 

misogynistic stereotypes against 
anyone in any setting. Elected 
officials must adhere to a higher 
standard regardless of the context of 
their remarks.”

In an interview with The Daily 

Jan. 20, when asked about the faculty 
letter and Weiser’s initial response 
to the events of Jan. 6, Schlissel 
referenced his own statement on 
behalf of the University condemning 
the violence and emphasized that all 
regents are elected by a statewide 
vote.

Schlissel did not then criticize 

Weiser, either implicitly or explicitly.

“I’ve known Regent Weiser 

practically since I arrived here,” 
Schlissel said. “He has lived locally, 
and he’s a major donor to the 
University. I know for sure that 
his affections for the University 
run deep… So, I think that the 
many faculty and students in 
the community and others that 
have objections are raising those 
objections, they’re getting lots of 
coverage in the media, and those fall 
into the political process. It’ll have 
to be worked out, but I can say that 
the University itself, as well as all the 
regents, unambiguously condemn 
the violence and those that incited 
the violence. That’s not a matter of 
question.”

• Six U-M Women Deans
All six U-M deans who are 

women wrote a letter on March 28 
condemning Weiser’s comments. 
The letter was signed by LSA Dean 
Anne Curzan, School of Nursing 
Dean Patricia Hurn, School of 
Dentistry Dean Laurie McCauley, 
School of Education Dean Elizabeth 
Birr Moje, School of Kinesiology 
Dean Lori Ploutz-Snyder and School 
of Social Work Dean Lynn Videka. 
All 13 additional deans signed the 
letter in solidarity. 

“We feel strongly that your 

comments do not support the 
university’s and our units’ values 
of diversity, equity, inclusion, and 
justice,” the letter reads. “Nor do 
your comments support robust civil 
debate and democratic engagement. 
The latter point is particularly 
saddening and ironic because you 
have been a champion of democratic 
values through institutions you have 
supported on our campus.”

• Washtenaw County 

Prosecutor Eli Savit

Savit called Weiser’s comments 

“misogynistic and violent” in a 
tweet on March 26.

ANN ARBOR


The first time I became aware 

of my body, I was 12 years old at an 
outdoor water park. I sat in an inflated 
tube, swaying back and forth in an 
obnoxiously loud wave pool with my 
sister and friends. It was a perfect day 
until it wasn’t. At one moment, my sister 
and friends had been taken elsewhere by 
the manufactured tide and I sat swaying 
along, enjoying the blazing sun on my 
face and the cool of the water on my feet. 
I was then approached by two white 
teenage boys, who I first thought were 
mistaking me for someone else. One of 
them looks at me, stifles a chuckle and 
eloquently slurs: 

“Hey, I just wanted to let you know 

my boy over here thinks you’re hot.” 

The boys erupted into a fit of laughter 

and swam away, likely never to think of 
that moment again. They were to move on 
in the world, unaware of the effect of their 
words on the women they encounter, 
unaware of its effects on me. But I sat 
there, suddenly aware of the layers of extra 
fabric clinging to my skin, embarrassed 
and choked by the polyester hijab that 
circled my face; suddenly aware of how 
ridiculous I must have looked for two 
white boys to approach me and jokingly 
tell me they thought I looked “hot.” In that 
moment, what was a perfect day turned 
into a demarcation of when I first became 
uncomfortable being a visibly Muslim 
woman in a country that valued women 
based on their appearance. I didn’t tell 
anyone about this — not my sisters, not my 
friends. I just wanted to shrivel up like my 
pruned feet in that wave pool, never to be 
seen again by anyone. 

Since then, I’ve always known 

my body, a woman’s body, a Muslim 
woman’s body, to be a complicated thing. 
And I don’t mean that in a feminist, 
body-positive way, though I am both of 
those things. What I mean is, a woman’s 
body sometimes feels like a free-for-all, a 
legislated playground that starts to feel 
like less of a body and more of a foreign 
object that does not feel in line with the 
rest of one’s being.

After that moment, I tried to minimize 

the parts of me that made me visibly 
Muslim. I no longer prayed in public and 
sometimes opted for a hoodie instead 
of a hijab. When I was in high school, I 
became obsessed with makeup because 
it was the only part of my appearance 
that I could control. Every paycheck that 
I got from my cashier job at the dreaded 
local supermarket went straight to Ulta 
and Sephora. I would watch tutorials 
and wake up two hours early for school 
just to cover my face in extravagant 
paints and powders, to look like someone 
I wanted to present to the world. When 
my mom criticized my makeup addiction 
and questioned who I was putting in all 
that extra effort for, I shot back with the 
quintessential response: “I’m doing it 
for me.” And like many women, I think 
I started to believe it. I started to believe 
that my desire to make myself more 

desirable stemmed from myself and 
was uninfluenced by external factors 
and opinions. To an extent, women do 
perform these things for themselves. It 
is a form of self-preservation to take care 
of oneself, to put meticulous care and 
effort into carefully coordinated outfits, 
perfectly manicured nails, curled and 
coated eyelashes. But I couldn’t help 
but wonder if at some point, for some 
women, did this desire stop being a 
form of self-preservation and become a 
manifestation of social expectations?

Some time in high school I was 

introduced to white feminism, which at 
the time I thought was just feminism, not 
thinking about the ways it often excluded 
women who looked like me. Feminism 
told me I should wear what I want, date 
who I want, do what I want and I loved 
it. I championed the agenda to my Arab 
and Muslim family, who told me not to 

be like those Godless Amerkaan who 
showed their bodies and slept around and 
didn’t care about their family’s reputation. 
Feminism told me all women were equal 
and that our choices were only ours to 
make. It talked about freeing the nipple 
and empowering women to strip down, 
but did nothing to empower women who 
chose to cover up. It talked about free 
access to abortion in America, but not 
about forced sterilizations and sexual 
assault in refugee camps. It talked down 
on women I knew and loved, women 
like my mother and my aunts and my 
grandmother who chose to stay at home 
and raise children, raise villages, which 
was a world of work in itself. It told me to 
make my own choices, but didn’t tell me 
what to make of the women who did not 
have access to the same choices. It didn’t 
tell me how to balance expressing my 
individuality and owning my body while 
remaining respectful to my culture and 
true to my faith.

Becoming comfortable in my skin 

is a process. For Muslim women, 
expectations of what one should be are 
drastically different for women who 
choose to wear the hijab versus those 
who don’t. In the Muslim faith, hijab is a 
commandment of God when a girl comes 
of age, as are praying, fasting, giving to 
charity, etc. However, like everything 
else in life and religion, every choice is 
a personal one and everyone’s journey 
is different. Nonetheless, by putting 
themselves on display, women who 
choose to wear the hijab are exposing 
themselves to the unwarranted and 
relentless ideals imposed on them by two 
competing sides — Western society and 
the Muslim community. 

On one end, we are being told by 

Western society: You are oppressed, and 
in order to liberate yourself, you must reject 
the restrictive notions imposed upon you 
by your community. But this liberation 
comes at a price: We will set you free, but 
at the same time, we will make you want 
to change everything about yourself that 
makes you “other.” Your Arab nose, your 
thick curly hair. We will eat up the parts 
of your culture we deem worthy. Your 
delicious food, your exotic dancing. 
We will don hijabs on scantily clad 

models on runways but scoff in pity 
when it’s a part of your everyday life. 
Almost every Arab woman I know has 
either gotten or talked about getting 
plastic surgery. Nose jobs and face lifts, 
keratin hair treatments, thinned and 
tattooed eyebrows. And the discourse 
surrounding these treatments is mostly 
positive and uplifting. It is a woman’s 
choice what to do with her body. Yes, but 
to what extent is it really that woman’s 
choice when notions of what she should 
look like are ingrained into her from the 
moment she is old enough to switch on 
the television? 

On the other end, our body is an open-

ended discussion for Muslim and Arab 
men, who drown out the sound of their 
own shortcomings with the sound of us 
messing up. They tell us our clothes are 
not modest enough and simultaneously 
shame us for not being “open-minded 
enough” and willing to bend our rules for 
their own pleasure. Elder women look at 
you in disgust in the grocery line because 
the strands falling out of your loosened 
silk hijab tell them I am American before 
I am Muslim, before I am Arab, before I 
am anything.

I’ll give you an example. Last summer, 

after returning from my study abroad 
program, I was working at a small 
Yemeni restaurant near my house. One 
day, I was serving a table of older men, 
dressed in abayas and turbans who 
looked at me a little too long when I 
brought them their appetizers. I ignored 
the feeling I got — that pit-in-the-bottom-
of-your-stomach feeling that makes you 
feel like you are on display, that sudden 
awareness of body — and continued 
doing my job, even when I saw the men 
stop my coworker to whisper something 
in her ear as she walked by. Later on that 
night, my sister, who is closer friends 
with my coworker, told me what those 
men said: They wanted my coworker to 
tell me that my shirt was too short, that 
a hijabi like me should dress better in a 
place like this where men come and are 
free to look. She was too shy to tell me in 
the restaurant and I’m glad she didn’t.

When I first put on my hijab at 9 years 

old, I was not thinking about these things. 
I was not thinking about my physical 
appearance or how I would go on to be 
perceived in the world. I wasn’t thinking 
about how the deliberate covering of 
my body would lead to an undeliberate 
uncovering of my identity in every room 
I walked through — that I would be 
judged as Muslim first, human second. 
I didn’t think about the humiliation I 
would feel at that waterpark and how 
subsequently, swimming — something I 
used to love and enjoy— would become 
something I dreaded and avoided. I was 
thinking: My mom and my sister wear it. 
I love my mom and my sister. I love God, 
and he wants me to wear it. And I never 
regretted it, never saw it as anything 
other than an extension of my identity, a 
testament to my faith in God, until that 
day at the waterpark. After that, it became 
something that clearly announced me 
as “other,” something boys would never 
find attractive, something my American 
peers would never understand or accept. I 
worried they would think I was somehow 
less educated, somehow less American 
than them, somehow more docile and 
less assertive and more passive. I don’t 
remember my first experience with 
discrimination in America; at this point 
these instances have blended into a myriad 
of little moments, microaggressions and 
blatant remarks, but I can tell you about 
the first time I became aware that my 
body was not always something that 
would feel like mine. 

To most, identity politics are known 

as a garnering of support for a political 
figure or platform that represents 
specific 
demographics, 
whether 

that be race, religion, gender, etc. In 
recent years, the relevancy of identity 
politics has increased as diversity in 
government has become much more 
important now than ever before. For 
example, the pool of 2020 Democratic 
presidential nominees was the most 
diverse the party has ever had. We 
have gotten to a point where identity 
markers have started to be seen as a 
form of virtue signaling. More often 
than not, someone is assumed to be a 
good person just because they belong 
to one or more marginalized groups. 
This strips the nuances of an individual 
and automatically assigns them a 
certain amount of morality based upon 
a few characteristics. While uplifting 
members of minority groups in politics 
is beneficial for representation, it can 
be harmful when it’s done without 
knowing a politician’s background 
and platform. Representation alone 

isn’t enough if a politician’s policies are 
harmful to their constituents. 

Take Lori Lightfoot, mayor of 

Chicago, for example. Her campaign 
was groundbreaking because she was 
a frontrunner to be the first gay, Black 
mayor of Chicago. However, while she 
was making headlines and gaining 
popularity because of this, many 
overlooked her background as a federal 
prosecutor and voted for her solely 
because of the facets of her identity, 
rather than the specific policies that 
she stands for. Consequently, her 
missteps as mayor have not been 
condemned nearly enough. In the 

most recent poll taken of her approval 
rating by Wirepoints last October, her 
approval still stands at over 60%. In 
February 2021, she spent $281.5 million 
in federal COVID-19 relief funds on the 
Chicago Police Department payroll, 
even though she had proposed a 
reduction in their budget back in 2020. 
In addition to this, she also refused 
to reduce the funding of the police 
force within Chicago Public Schools 
despite calls for her to disinvest in 
the CPD. While Lightfoot continues 
to maintain that she is only trying to 
do what is best for Chicagoans, her 
actions do anything but. After violent 

clashes between the police and Black 
Lives Matter protesters last summer 
in Chicago, it seemed to me and others 
that a positive step towards reconciling 
the tension between civilians and 
the police force would be to reduce 
their ability to inflict harm on citizens 
by defunding their operations and 
reallocating funds to social services 
and community programs. Instead, 
Lightfoot put even more money into 
the CPD, enabling them to continue 
their aggressive tactics. 

Another example of the harms 

of identity politics is current Vice 
President Kamala Harris. While it 
may be groundbreaking that she is our 
first female, Black and South Asian 
Vice President, her faults in her past 
as a “tough-on-crime” prosecutor are 
often ignored. In 2010, she sponsored 
a state truancy law as a part of her 
Truancy Project, which was designed 
to promote consistent attendance for 
young people in grade school. While the 
intent to reduce truancy in schools may 
have been well placed, the execution 
in 
the 
form 
of 
criminalization 

was 
extremely 
harmful. 
The 

implementation of this law led to the 
arrests of several parents, most of 

them being Black mothers, because 
their 
children 
were 
consistently 

absent from school due to outside 
circumstances like lack of access 
to food, resources or safe housing. 
Rather than focusing on combating the 
factors that may contribute to a lack of 
attendance in school, Harris resorted 
to unnecessarily severe punishment. 
Parents were unjustly arrested with 
little to no consideration for their 
domestic situations. Approximately 
two in five children ages two years 
and older whose parents have been 
arrested endure significant emotional 
and behavioral problems, which is 
roughly twice the rate when compared 
to children in the general population. 
From announcing her campaign for 
presidency on Martin Luther King 
Jr. Day to playing Tupac at her book 
signings, Harris seemed to publicly 
align herself with her Blackness 
through not-so-subtle cultural cues 
all 
throughout 
her 
presidential 

campaign. This comes across as 
highly performative because of her 
past in facilitating mass incarceration 
within Black communities. Despite 
her 
obvious 
pandering, 
Harris 

still garnered support from Black 

Americans 
after 
joining 
Biden’s 

campaign as the vice presidential 
nominee, which surely helped in 
their election in Nov. 2020. Even as 
vice president, she is still inflicting 
harm on entire communities. Since 
Inauguration Day in January, the 
Biden-Harris 
administration 
has 

been issuing drone strikes in Syria, 
physically harming countless civilians. 
It is important to not assume such high 
morality of politicians — or anyone 
for that matter — just because of the 
marginalized groups that they fall into.

On a personal level, I had to take 

a step back and figure out when 
heavily relying on identity politics was 
clouding my political alliances. I, like 
many others, would love to have more 
representation in government from 
people who look like me, especially 
considering that the abilities of highly 
competent politicians like Stacey 
Abrams are often overlooked because 
they belong to minority identities. 
However, we have to keep reminding 
ourselves that not all representation is 
good representation and that research 
into a politician’s platform and 
background should always be done 
before giving them our full support.

As a person of color, any type of application, 

whether it be college, job or internship applications 
are always equipped with stress, self-doubt and 
insecurity. I feel alone in academic and social 
settings at the University of Michigan, with about 
55% of the student population being white and the 
median family income being a staggering $154,000 
for the Fall 2020 undergraduate population. I, as a 
minority student who does not have the privilege 
of wealth nor whiteness, have had to endure a 
college experience overrun by feelings of imposter 
syndrome. Here at the University, I constantly feel 
the pressure of social and economic factors like race 
and social class that lead me to lose belief in myself 
academically and professionally. I dream to go to law 
school and become a lawyer, which I know will force 
me to exist within more intimidating environments 
of professionalism, whiteness and years of enhanced 
feelings of being an imposter. 

Interacting with students in my sociology, 

political science and public policy classes has 
resulted in very interesting yet uncomfortable 
conversations. It seems like almost every student 
has been interning for their local congressman 
since high school and have parents who own their 
own law firm. Comparing my background and 
experiences to others, the overwhelming sense of 
competition makes me anxious and worried about 
my future at the University and beyond due to my 
lack of experience compared to my peers. When it 
comes to discussions surrounding internships or any 
other professional opportunity, the number of white 
students who seem to have been handed positions 
because of their family’s privilege is honestly 
astounding. 

This past January, I started my application to the 

Ford School of Public Policy. Even before the start of 
my freshman year, I already knew I wanted to apply 
to this program come the winter of my sophomore 
year, and I worked my ass off both academically 
and professionally to try to secure an acceptance. I 
completed the prerequisites courses early, pursued 
internships that aligned 
with my political interests 
and became an involved 
student at the University to 
solidify that public policy 
was my passion while 
proving to admissions that 
I was a dedicated student. 
I thought what I was doing 
would be enough and that 
I would stand out among 
hundreds 
of 
applicants 

all competing for a spot 
in the 70- to 80-person 
cohort. But when talking 
to other students who 
had the same dream of 
attending the Public Policy 
School, it seemed that their experiences, grades and 
accomplishments were much more prestigious than 
mine. And when it was time to start my application, I 
needed to think of something that made me different 
from the rest of the applicants. There was an easy 
conclusion: my ethnicity. I am a Latino student at 
the University; I am a part of the mere 6.98% of the 
undergraduate population that is Latinx.

Diversity has been proven to be beneficial in the 

classroom. Whether it’s ethnicity, socioeconomic 
class or religion that sets individual students apart, 
learning in diverse environments improves students’ 
cognitive skills and critical thinking. By boosting 
an individual’s abilities and intellect, diverse 
classrooms nurture further academic success and 
innovation. More diverse classrooms not only make 
me feel more comfortable, but they also create an 
open space for dialogue regarding important issues 
affecting various cultures and ethnicities. I knew my 
ethnicity would benefit the Public Policy School’s 
cohort, but I did not want to wonder if I had only 
been accepted for the sake of the school’s diversity 
numbers. My imposter syndrome made me feel that 
my experiences and grades would not be enough 
for the acceptance email that I’ve been dreaming of 
since I learned about the Public Policy School. 

I had to come to accept that a majority of the 

students applying, on paper, most likely appeared to 
admissions as identical. So many of us are pre-law, 

political science majors waiting on an acceptance to 
the Public Policy School. Most of us are politically 
active and involved in related organizations on 
campus, and some of us naively believe we can 
become president one day. Due to this, I knew the 
one place I could truly stand out would be in the 
application essays. It felt like the three 300- to 400-
word essays would determine my future. 

After filling out basic demographic information in 

the early part of the online application, it was finally 
time to view the essay prompts. Unsurprisingly, the 
first one was the staple “diversity essay.” 

This year’s prompt started out by informing 

the applicants about how research has shown 
that diverse work groups are better at solving 
problems. They noted, however, that working in 
such groups can present considerable challenges 
to students who struggle to work with others from 
different backgrounds. The question then asked the 
applicants to write about an experience working in a 
diverse setting and specifically asked that the essay 
be focused around the challenges of working with 
differences. The final part of the prompt questioned 
the applicants to discuss in what ways one could 
improve on how productive and respectful they 
were to others of a different background. 

Though I was expecting at least one essay to 

prompt me about my background, this question was 
the most difficult one to write, taking me weeks of 
constant drafting and editing. I think it’s important 
for admissions committees to ask questions which 
allow students to vulnerably talk about their 
identities, but when it comes to this specific question, 
it seemed that the committee was only trying to 
see how white students have been able to interact 
in diverse settings. Instead of just asking about an 
experience in working in a diverse community, they 
asked about how the environment was challenging. 
After rereading the prompt over and over, I began 
to get angry. In what environment at the University 
have I had the opportunity to even work in a diverse 
setting? To me, this question asked, “How, as a 
person of color, have you faced challenges working in 
a diverse environment despite never being in one?” 
I’m almost always one of about three Latinx students 
in 300-person lectures, the only person of color in 

discussion sections and 
one of four brown students 
crossing the entire Diag, 
the center of the University. 
In all of my group projects 
and breakout rooms, I 
often find myself having to 
settle without having my 
ideas appreciated, being 
talked over and feeling 
stupid. I wish I had the 
opportunity to work in 
a diverse group setting 
so that I could finally be 
listened to, not doubted or 
ignored, but that is simply 
not the reality here at the 
University. 

I reflected on the final part of the aforementioned 

prompt: “Are there things you wish you had done 
differently or might do differently in the future 
to work more respectfully and productively with 
people who differ from you?” No, but this question 
caters to white students who trample the minority 
students at this school, creating a welcoming 
prompt for them to ease their way into. When 
talking to older friends in the Public Policy School 
who helped edit my essay, we all agreed that this 
prompt seemed to be purposefully phrased so 
that admissions would be able to see which white 
students were “woke” in appreciating diversity 
and understanding its importance. These students 
are obviously necessary for a holistically diverse 
environment, but the ease of being able to discuss 
working with people of different backgrounds 
provides advantages to white applicants over 
actual students who would contribute to a diverse 
cohort. I am a person of color who has solely been 
in majority-white environments, I could not think 
of a time where I faced a challenge working across 
differences, because I have rarely been presented 
with differences in my work environments. A 
challenge I have to constantly deal with is not 
being valued as a thinker and student within the 
classroom. It’s not my duty to respectfully and 
productively work with students who can’t see past 
my skin color.

U-M professors, Michigan public officials discuss roots of anti-Asian 

racism, but suggestions for what to do in the face of hate fall short

Disclaimer: The author and Michigan in 

Color as a whole do not condone involvement 
of the carceral state or any perpetuation of 
criminalization. The solutions covered in this 
event are not solutions the author is advocating 
for, but rather solutions offered at the event that 
Michigan in Color remain in search of alternatives 
to. Please see resources the author has provided 
related to bystander intervention training at the 
end of this article for more possibilities. 

The Michigan Asian Pacific American 

Affairs Commission held a compelling town 
hall over Zoom Friday to combat the rise 
in anti-Asian hate and teach viewers how 
they can be allies to the Asian American 
community. The goal of the event was to take a 
look at the racism Asian Americans have faced 
in the past, policies created to discriminate 
against Asian Americans and the rise in race-
motivated violence against Asian Americans 
during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, when it came to offering Asian 

Americans resources to turn to, public 
officials only presented options involving 
law enforcement — which is a harmful 
perpetuation of oppressive systems. 

The list of speakers included Roland 

Hwang, 
lecturer 
in 
the 
Asian/Pacific 

Islander American Studies Department at 
the University of Michigan; Melissa May 

Borja, assistant professor at the University’s 
Department of American Culture; Sunita 
Doddamani, Michigan assistant attorney 
general and head of the hate crimes unit; 
Attorney General Dana Nessel and Anthony 
Lewis, director of the Michigan Department 
of Civil Rights. 

The event started with a few words from 

Governor Gretchen Whitmer. She offered 
her condolences to the Asian community and 
condemned the recent acts of violence against 
them, particularly the mass shootings at 
several Asian-owned spas in Atlanta.

“I want to make our values very clear, hate 

has no home in Michigan,” Whitmer said. 

Then, Borja presented a powerful slideshow 

containing information on how racism against 
Asian Americans began in America and how 
this violence has spread due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. 

“This idea, this fear of Asian people, is 

known as the yellow peril,” Borja said. 

She then recalled historical events like the 

Chinese Exclusion Act and conveyed how 
Chinese, Korean and Japanese individuals 
were discriminated against at the American 
border in the late 19th century and throughout 
the 20th century. 

Seeing Borja acknowledge America’s racist 

past was impressive because she reminded 
attendees of the discrimination Asians have 
always faced in America. When society does 
not acknowledge these past hardships, it 
perpetuates the model minority myth. The 
model minority myth is the stereotype that all 

Asian Americans are academically successful 
and come from prestigious families. Failure 
to reflect on America’s racist history excludes 
Asian Americans of lower socioeconomic 
statuses, along with those victim to unequal 
policy and those seeking refuge from America-
initiated wars. Throughout American history, 
Asians have had to leave their country in order 
to come to America because of American 
military influence in their country. It does not 
bring awareness to the fact that the majority of 
Asians were blamed for bringing illnesses and 
diseases to America in the late 1800s when the 
transcontinental railroad was built. The model 
minority myth diminishes and invalidates 
the increase in violence rooted in racism that 
Asian Americans have been experiencing 
in America ever since the beginning of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. It enforces the idea that 
Asian Americans do not struggle. 

Borja also discussed how increasing anti-

Asian violence can be tied to political rhetoric 
surrounding the pandemic, most notably by 
former President Donald Trump.

“Researchers based at Berkeley did a study 

and they found that in the 10 years leading 
up to 2020, there was actually a downward 
decline or downward trend in anti-Asian 
bias,” Borja said. “But that downward trend 
was reversed the first week of March when 
politicians and conservative media began to 
use terms like ‘China virus.’” 

According to Stop AAPI Hate, there have 

been a total of 3,792 reports of anti-Asian hate 
incidents from March 2020 to March 2021. 

Incident reports have come from all over the 
country, ranging from verbal harassment 
to physical assault directed towards Asian 
Americans in public, Borja said. 

Additionally, Borja attacked some myths 

that have been spreading on social media 
during her presentation. According to Borja, 
there is a common belief that the hate Asian 
Americans are experiencing is only targeted 
towards the elderly population. However, Borja 
stated that there has also been an increase in 
bullying reported by Asian American children. 
Children are more likely to experience verbal 
harassment, but elders are more likely to 
experience physical harassment, Borja said. 

In addition, she noted 68% of attacks have 

been against women, showing that they are 
specifically targeted because of America’s 
violent history against Asian women. 

I can list numerous examples from my own 

self-education: for example, a notable policy 
that discriminates against Asian women is the 
The Page Act of 1875. It was enacted because 
Chinese women were hypersexualized and 
feared to be engaging in prostitution in the 
United States. This notion is not true, as 
many women traveled to America to prosper 
economically and to be reunited with their 
spouses. During World War II, the Korean 
War and in Vietnam, there was an increase 
in demand for Asian sex workers because 
of America’s military influence. In today’s 
world Asian women recall street harassment, 
unsolicited sexual comments from coworkers 
and have been subjected to men projecting 

their fetishes onto them. With the recent 
shootings in Atlanta it is evident how men 
have gone to the extreme to project their 
sexual fantasies on Asian women when the 
suspect claims he had a “sexual addiction” 
and saw the spa as “a temptation he needed to 
eliminate.” Asian women have never been safe 
as a result of over 100 years of being subjected 
to sexual objectification. 

Towards the end of her presentation, Borja 

discussed ways non-Asian individuals can be 
allies to the Asian community at this time. 
The methods she discussed are summarized 
below: 1) Reach out to your Asian American 
friends. However, do not reach out to your 
Asian friends just because they are Asian. 
Reach out to them because you see their 
hurt, not to relieve your guilt. 2) Discuss 
microaggressions and what they may look 
like in public, so you know when to intervene. 
3) Refrain from using harmful expressions 
when talking about the COVID-19 pandemic. 
4) Encourage victims to report hatred to 
organizations like Stop AAPI Hate. 5) Take 
part in a Hollaback bystander intervention 
training to learn how to intervene when you 
see violence rooted in racism. 

Finally, Borja addressed the narrative 

of the divide between the Black and Asian 
communities. She said the increased levels 
of harassment experienced by the Asian 
community is rooted in white supremacy.

Sinophobia as an immigrant

My phone alerted me that I had a new 

message request on Instagram. Upon opening 
the message, I froze. “You’re way too ugly for 
that Chinese virus.”

I had received that message on Instagram 

exactly a year ago, at the beginning of 
the pandemic. It was a reply to one of my 
Instagram story highlights, a basic selfie of me 
posing and smiling in front of the backdrop of 
a wall. The account was anonymous, of course 
— I suspect that the user did not want to suffer 
the consequences of spewing racist hatred 
if they were to be exposed. Though I was 
stunned at the pure bigotry in the sentence, 
that message was far from the only time I have 
experienced anti-Asian racism.

I am Chinese, both ethnically and nationally. 

I was born in Shanghai and raised in Beijing. 
I had an unassuming childhood until one 
Friday night when I was 13. With my hair still 
wet after having gone to the community pool, 
my parents sat me down on the couch. Our 
conversation that night was exhilarating: They 
told me that we were emigrating to the United 
States of America. I leaped from the couch up 
and down in elation. America was sugar, spice 
and everything nice to naïve, 13-year-old me. 
I took pride in excelling in my English classes, 
which were taught by American teachers who 
wore trendy clothes and perfume, unlike their 
Chinese counterparts. My favorite movie, 
“The Avengers,” which had just came out in 
2013, had a predominantly white cast: I envied 
the characters’ beauty, especially their pale 
skin, and admired the luxurious and futuristic 
lifestyle they led. 

The following year was almost unbearable 

as I counted the days until we would actually 
move overseas. During the final months, I even 
made my own grid paper with dates to help me 
count down the days. I kept it in my pencil case 
so that I could color it in like a scantron with 
eagerness and excitement every morning in 
my homeroom. I did so very obnoxiously so 
that my classmates around me would notice. 
I wanted them to be jealous of me because, 
just as I did, the other students understood the 
perks of being American. Little did I know that 
being an immigrant in America came with 
many burdens. 

The whirlwind change in my life came at a 

price: I had a hard time fitting in at my new high 
school. I did not speak English fluently like my 
peers. While my entire high school was ecstatic 
about the whip and nae nae dance, I responded 
to my dancing classmates with awkward 
laughter, as I didn’t know the routine nor where 
it originated from. Fitting in was a particularly 
impossible feat for me, considering I was an 
awkward foreign girl who was new to the town 
and the school system. I was being tutored on 
grammar every study block when I had English 
class, much to my embarrassment. I sat with 
my English teacher at her desk breaking down 
grammar structures while my peers snacked, 
laughed and chatted in their seats. It was 
difficult making friends and my loneliness took 
a toll on me. 

Being an immigrant was uncomfortable 

beyond a personal level as well. I soon began 
to realize that China, my home country, had 
nowhere near a positive image here in the 
United States, even pre-COVID-19. Sinophobia 
was all over the news and the media. I became 
hyper-aware of it. Everywhere I looked, my 
home country was being overwhelmingly 

portrayed as filthy, corrupt and authoritarian, 
without a single mention of our traditions, 
humility or culture. It was unsettling that 
the latter had always been my focus when 
perceiving my home country, but to some, 
the Chinese Communist Party’s perceived 
wrongdoings are all they knew about the 
nation. Anytime I saw China on the news, it 
was an alarming report on either pollution, 
CCP censorship and mass surveillance or its 
propaganda. Does China have its own issues? 
Yes, but often it feels like these issues are only 
reported by western media to demonize China 
as a whole and not out of genuine concern for 
its citizens. The news reports are not a call 
for change nor action — they are sweeping 
generalizations that can lead to real-world 
consequences.

Sinophobia was embedded in entertainment 

as well in the form of stereotypes. While white 
characters with, for example, European or 
Australian accents are portrayed as mysterious 
and attractive, Chinese accents are foreign and 
the butt of the joke in many Hollywood movies. 

I started becoming ashamed of my roots and 

began to downplay my identity — as much as I 
hate to admit it, I didn’t want to be associated 
with neither the “corrupt” Chinese government 
nor the offensive stereotypes. When I first 
moved as a child, I often announced with pride 
to the class that I was from Beijing whenever my 
teacher asked if there was a new kid present. As 
time went on, I no longer mentioned my home 
country and adjusted my accent to be more 
palatable and assimilate with my peers. The 
internal struggle was constant, though. While I 
considered myself American, I was still enraged 
any time anybody insulted my home country 
and my people. Once, one of my first American 
friends had pulled on the ends of her eyes as a 

joke. Though I laughed along and put on a front 
out of cowardice, I was fuming internally.

Fast forward a few years, you could not tell 

me apart from an Asian American who was 
born and raised here in the U.S. Over time, I 
had gradually lost my accent and even started 
to forget my mother tongue. This did not 
bother me as much, since fitting in and not 
being viewed as an anomaly meant everything 
to me then. I learned to forget and ignore the 
culture that raised me for fourteen years, but 
my experiences with racism in the COVID-19 
era, such as the aforementioned direct message, 
ushered in new painful realizations for me 
regarding my identity as a Chinese American. 

A year ago, the internet watched and 

sneered at the clips of Wuhan, China, where 
residents were dragged out of their homes into 
quarantine facilities during their city-wide 
shutdown. On the other side of the world, 
we enjoyed our temporary “freedom” and 
“normalcy.” It was an “aha” moment for a lot of 
Americans who have bought into sinophobia in 
the media — a moment where this sinophobia 
was justified in their minds. This is what some 

western media outlets do to its audiences: 
They have and continue to successfully equate 
the Chinese people to its government. On the 
other hand, Chinese people’s real suffering 
does not receive the much deserved attention 
due to mainstream media’s hyperfocus on 
the Chinese government’s corruption. As I 
expected, practically nobody extended their 
sympathy towards the people of Wuhan; 
instead social media watched these videos of 
the city amused, as if they were some sort of 
dystopian trauma porn. Help was never the 
topic of discussion.

On top of that, former President Donald 

Trump quickly assigned blame for COVID-
19, which emboldened individuals to commit 
vengeful acts of hatred, racism and violence 
towards Asian Americans. After the “kung 
flu” rhetoric, the “Chinese virus” controversy 
and the countless Asian hate crimes, I am truly 
exhausted as a young, Chinese immigrant 
woman living in the United States of America.

Winter wonderland

As 
I 
traveled 
from 
the 
Detroit 

Metropolitan Airport back to campus in 
January, I peered out the window of my cab 
with utter amazement. The sapphire sky and 
soft glow of the afternoon sun looked exactly 
as I had remembered it, but this time, the 
world was coated with snow. I come from a 
tropical climate, so the idea of a cold winter 
was totally foreign to me. The world cloaked 
in white looked so beautiful, just as I had 
imagined it in my head. I had spent years 
fantasizing about building a snowman and 
getting into snowball fights, so the brightness 
of the snow as it fell from the sky made me 
look forward to those new experiences that 
lay before me. This winter semester would 
finally allow me the opportunity to see and 
touch real snow for the very first time. Even 
though all of my classes were online and 
many of my friends had moved back home, I 
was determined to remain optimistic about 
this coming semester. After all, it’s college. 
I had spent years imagining late night 
adventures, striking up conversations with 
complete strangers and shouting the lyrics 
to trashy pop songs into the void of the night. 
Here, I could do anything I ever wanted, 
right? Snow gently wafted in the calm breeze 
sweeping through campus when I stepped 
out of my cab in front of East Quad Residence 
Hall building. I reached my hands out to 
catch the delicately hovering snowflakes, but 
their frigid tendrils stung my hands.

Over the next several weeks, the sky lost its 

vibrance. The uniformly gray clouds filled the 
sky with their emptiness. The days blended 

together as the winter nights devoured the 
afternoon sun. The dreariness of winter 
seeped through my window. My empty cans 
of energy drinks, all neatly stacked like legos 
in my overflowing recycling bin, were the 
most vibrant decor I owned. Even when I 
consumed 600mg of caffeine a day (halfway 
to risking seizures according to the Food and 
Drug Administration), I still couldn’t bring 
myself to make the arduous trek down the hall 
to the trash closet. The mess in my room held 
little importance since I was my only company 
anyway. I barely had the energy to walk 
downstairs to the dining hall, never mind my 
dreams of exploring the city around me.

On a particularly gloomy morning, 

desperate to rediscover the warmth I felt 
when I saw snow outside of my cab window 
for the first time, I ventured out into the 
cold. I circled the campus aimlessly as if I 
was waiting for some divine inspiration 
to strike me. I stared up into the colorless 
sky, waiting for fresh snow to fall and 
posing for what I imagined to be a beautiful 
cinematic shot in the imaginary movie of 
my life. Meanwhile, my feet trudged along 
the earth. The grime of the sidewalk fused 
with the slush of the trodden snow left 
behind a brown, misshapen depression 
in the wake of each step. It felt as though 
I was sinking into the ground itself. With 
each step my feet felt heavier and heavier. 
Eventually I dragged myself over the empty 
Diag, dusted off a snow-covered bench and 
let myself slouch over in my seat. 

In high school, I used to dream of escaping 

my mundane yet stressful life. I wanted to 
build a snowman, get into snowball fights 
and skate on the surface of a frozen lake. 
Yet between the cold, my coursework and 

COVID-19, I still had little control. The 
fantasy world I built was toppling down 
before my eyes, and I just had to accept it. The 
life I had imagined was not one that I could 
live. A cold anger ran through my veins. What 
use are dreams if they never materialize? 
Frustration mounted inside me, but I didn’t 
drink enough caffeine that morning to have 
the energy to be upset. My eyes drifted from 
the gray sky to the uneven frost-covered 
ground, while I just sat frozen in place. 

Then I noticed the footprints left by each 

passerby filled the whole sidewalk. Who were 
they? Where were they going? Why? I could 
never know the answers to these questions, 
and I realized that I didn’t need to know. I 
had spent so much time constructing intricate 
fantasies about my future that I couldn’t be 
satisfied with just not knowing something. 
Every raindrop, every snowflake, every dust 
particle had to be a metaphor. I had to be in 
control. Each time reality didn’t serve me, it 
felt as though the entire world was collapsing. 
But, my lack of control was relieving. I couldn’t 
control the weather or predict the future, 
and I realized that I could be just fine with 
that. Instead of hiding from anything that 
threatened my fantasy worldview, I chose to 
embrace the unpredictable and the unknown.

I pushed myself back up from the bench 

and balanced on my own two feet again. 
Who am I? Where was I going? Why? It 
was all up for me to decide. I chose to walk 
away from my past idealizations and learn 
how to accept my lack of agency. I looked 
neither up at the sky nor down at the 
ground but forward. I set my sights on the 
horizon and started walking back to my 
residence hall, letting the stray snowflakes 
fall on my face.

A walk around Ann Arbor

Lately, I’ve been finding it hard to identify 

the line where work stops and rest begins. 
Before this year, I was able to segment my days 
with commutes through hallways or greetings 
to new classmates, but as the COVID-19 
pandemic continues to impact traditional 
schooling structures, I can’t help but feel like 
my days have blurred into an indiscernible 
cycle where Zoom polls and Instagram stories 
don’t seem much different.

Unfortunately, I can’t bring about the 

conclusion of a pandemic or dispel online 
classes for the rest of the semester, so on days 
when another glance at my computer screen 
is sure to induce extreme frustration, I take a 
walk around Ann Arbor.

Sure, bustling classes have evolved into 

painfully silent breakout rooms, and even the 
most enthusiastic of professors have their 
mood dampened when forgetting to “share 
screen,” but one thing that never fails to excite 
me is the diverse atmosphere of campus. Here 
are three of my favorite Ann Arbor spots to 
visit on my daily walk.

The Law Quadrangle: This is the perfect 

place to pass through, especially as the 
weather becomes warmer. Walking off State 
Street and through the opening arches feels 
like entering a new world (Harry Potter vibes, 
anyone?), and there’s a sense of calmness 
floating through the air. Bonus points if you 
go later in the evening when the multitude of 
street lamps shine a warm light on the intricate 
architecture. Even on the busiest days, I know 
that spending a couple minutes navigating the 
peaceful walkways in the Law Quad is sure 

to reinvigorate me with the conviction that 
everything is as it’s meant to be.

Thompson Parking Structure Rooftop: 

A must-visit spot for optimal sunset viewing. 
Plus, there’s something about looking over 
Ann Arbor from way up above that gives me 
a sense of newfound perspective and power 
in mydaily accomplishments. If you’re an 
avid people watcher, this is the perfect spot to 
observe passersby on Thompson Street, from 
new couples walking tightly together to groups 
of friends debating over which bubble tea store 
to frequent. At around 7PM, the air gets a little 
crisper, and that stinging feeling of the breeze 
hitting my face coupled with an indescribable 
blend of sunset colors is the perfect conclusion 
to any overwhelming day.

The 
Ross 
(School 
of 
Business’s) 

Courtyard: I definitely never thought I’d 
say this, but somehow the words “Ross” 
and “peaceful” have become correlated in 
my mind. No thanks to internship culture 
but all thanks to the Ross Courtyard, which 
provides a moment of serenity among 
the seemingly never-ending movement 
of school and club work. The multitude 
of glass and terracotta creates an earthy 
environment, and the traffic from nearby 
roads never gets the opportunity to enter 
through the courtyard wind tunnel. There’s 
an underground study area, lots of trees and 
an overall stillness that is a rare treat for 
students traveling along the busy sidewalk 
of Tappan Avenue.

If you’ve been feeling like me lately, 

overwhelmed and desperate to escape from 
the grasp of a computer screen, talk a walk 
around Ann Arbor (or wherever you may be!) 
and discover the hidden locations and ideal 
lookout points that can recenter your day.

6 — Wednesday, April 7, 2021 

A little over a week ago, news broke 

of the death of former Metropolitan 
Opera 
conductor 
James 
Levine. 

Reporters and critics across the 
classical music and opera worlds 
wrote long obituaries that interrogated 
Levine’s complicated legacy.

The first item that most obituaries 

touched upon was Levine’s critical 
success as the conductor of the Met. 
He led the institution for four decades, 
turning a noted opera company 
into the biggest classical music 
organization in America. (Levine also 
spent some time as conductor of the 
Boston Symphony Orchestra and the 
Munich Philharmonic, though neither 
of these posts received as much critical 
attention.)

Following 
this 
explanation 
of 

Levine’s performance career, most 
obituaries mentioned the years of 
sexual misconduct allegations that led 
to Levine’s unceremonious dismissal 
from the Metropolitan Opera last year. 
Numerous young men have accused 
Levine of abusing his power as a 

conductor to sexually assault them; in 
at least one instance, an alleged assault 
was reported to police.

Many critics, performers and 

composers have taken Levine’s death 
as an opportunity to question the 
conductor worship that gave Levine so 
much power in the industry. Perhaps 
Levine’s alleged abuse would have 
been addressed sooner had he not held 
hundreds of careers in his hands.

While I agree with this critique, I 

fear that this singular focus on Levine 
distracts from the larger issue at hand: 
Numerous individuals in positions of 
authority over the course of Levine’s 
career failed to address his alleged 
abuse. With some combination of 
feigned ignorance and deliberate 
silence, these individuals allowed 
Levine’s alleged predation to continue 
unchecked.

The first known allegation of sexual 

assault against Levine, for example, 
comes from 1968, three years before 
he garnered critical acclaim as a 
conductor. Levine was nothing more 
than a 25-year-old faculty member at a 
Michigan music school at the time — it 
was the inherent power of his teaching 
position that aided in his alleged 

perpetration of abuse. 

Had any other faculty members in 

this program learned of this alleged 
abuse, they could presumably have 
taken steps to address the abuse 
without facing significant professional 
repercussions. Levine did not yet hold 
the keys to hundreds of artists’ careers.

Though I can’t speak to the whisper 

network that presumably surrounded 
Levine throughout his professional 
career, I can write about the whisper 
network that long surrounded Stephen 
Shipps, former University of Michigan 
music school professor. (In 2018, I 
helped report four decades of previously 
undisclosed sexual harassment and 
misconduct allegations against Shipps; 
he was indicted on two sex crime 
charges in October and faces a post-
pandemic criminal trial.)

In The Daily’s first article on this 

case, we reported that Shipps’s alleged 
abuse was reported to a music school 
professor in the summer after Shipps’s 
hiring was announced and before 
he started teaching. This was in 1989 
— Shipps had not yet accumulated 
institutional power as a department 
chair, associate dean and youth 
program director. It remains unclear if 

the music school professor reported this 
allegation. It similarly is unknown if the 
University launched any investigation 
before granting Shipps tenure.

A few months ago, I obtained 

a statement that was sent to the 
prosecutors working on Shipps’s 
criminal case. The statement came 
from a former North Carolina School 
of the Arts violin student. In it, he spoke 
of the administrative indifference 
that he believes the school’s dean 
demonstrated 
toward 
allegations 

against Shipps.

“(The 
school’s 
then-dean) 

perpetuated Shipps’ inappropriate 
sexual conduct,” the former student 
wrote, “and allowed it to continue 
for 30 more years at the University of 
Michigan … This could have all ended 
in 1986 if (he) had taken the appropriate 
actions.”

I remember when I first learned 

about 
this 
former 
dean 
while 

interviewing a survivor that later went 
on the record. She mentioned that this 
dean was still teaching at the collegiate 
level. Unlike many of the other 
authority figures she believed ignored 
her allegations of abuse, he could still 
be held accountable for his actions.

When I reached him by email, he 

told me that he could not remember 
much of his time as the dean of the 
North Carolina School of the Arts.

“I was at NCSA from 1986-90,” he 

wrote. “It was long ago, and I have 
done so many things since then. I am 
not sure I could be of much help.”

He did not respond to multiple 

emails providing him with more details 
about the alleged sexual misconduct 
that took place during his time as dean. 
It remains unclear if prosecutors have 
sought to interview him based on the 
information they received.

It took tremendous bravery for nine 

survivors to speak to The Daily about 
the alleged sexual harassment and 

misconduct they experienced, and it 
took significant bravery for numerous 
friends and former colleagues of these 
survivors to corroborate specific 
aspects of their accounts.

It would have taken comparatively 

little bravery for a professor or a 
dean to address allegations of sexual 
misconduct that had been raised against 
their colleague — I would hope that it is 
within a dean’s basic job description 
that they actively address allegations of 
sexual misconduct that leave some of 
their students feeling unsafe.

Ra’anan Alexandrowicz’s (“The 

Law in These Parts”) “The Viewing 
Booth” is perhaps the most stimulating 
and perspective-altering documentary 
that I have ever seen. A film with 
two subjects, the Israeli occupation 
of Palestine and an analysis of 
documentary filmmaking itself, “The 
Viewing Booth” is thoughtful and self-
critical as it explores the manner in 
which we observe.

In short, the viewer of the film 

watches the watcher. A young 
woman, Maia Levy, enters a booth 
and sits before a computer screen and 
camera. Forty YouTube videos have 
been preselected by the filmmaker: 

half represent the perspective of 
Palestinians living under occupation, 
the other half presents the points of 
view of the Israeli settlers’ and soldiers’. 
Levy watches these at her own pace 
and is asked to speak her thoughts 
aloud as she reacts to the footage.

Levy is familiar with the Israeli-

Palestinian conflict: Her parents are 
Israeli, and she recently traveled to 
Hebron. She knows of the human-
rights group, B’Tselem — which 
produced or uploaded many of the 
Palestinian-perspective videos — and 
has seen a few of the clips before. As 
she clicks from video to video, pausing 
occasionally to think and respond, the 
viewer watches her face lit by the blue 
glow of a screen.

On one level, this film is about the 

Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Despite 

Levy’s 
even-handed 
deliverance 

of skepticism (there is much talk of 
events being “staged” — both clips 
of altruism and brutality by the 
Israeli military are given this label), 
she makes her own beliefs clear: 
Israel is acting morally, and there 
must be some justification for this 
mistreatment of Palestinians.

Her honesty is surprising, and 

her occasional racist commentary 
is embarrassing: “They lie a lot,” she 
says, referring to Arabs. She watches 
the videos with a confusing mix 
of open-mindedness and disbelief, 
acknowledging that these videos 
depict real events, but searching for 
the missing piece, the Arab instigation.

At one point, Levy asks: “Why 

would I believe this?” In other words, 
if she believes the Israeli army to be 

acting morally, why take this seriously?

Alexandrowicz has made more 

conventional films about the Israeli 
occupation, and this film offers a 
step back. His decision to make this 
film, to reframe the conversation 
around the viewer and observer of 
the situation in Palestine, becomes the 
film’s true subject by its conclusion. 
Through voice-over, he explains to 
the viewer and to Levy that the reason 
he focuses the film entirely on her, 
despite interviewing other students, 
is because she represents the intended 
viewer of his past films.

Levy’s steadfast skepticism is of 

interest to Alexandrowicz because 
it presents him with a frightening 
possibility: His films might do no 
more than preach to the choir. In this 
sense, “The Viewing Booth” is about 

the act of viewership. The film ends 
with a follow-up interview, in which 
Levy watches the recording of herself 
watching the films. The audience 
is three degrees removed from the 
footage, and the film begins to focus 
more pointedly on the process and 
psychology of watching.

Earlier in the film, Alexandrowicz 

states 
that 
these 
war 
videos 

“transform 
the 
viewer 
into 
a 

witness.” There is perhaps more 
responsibility coded into the latter 
term, as viewership is passive 
while witnessing is implicative. 
Alexandrowicz probes Levy’s desire 
to find fault and place blame on the 
Palestinians as an active resistance 
to this sort of implication, but Levy 
attributes the behavior to bias. She 
recognizes her filtered perspective, 

informed by her identity as the 
Jewish child of Israelis and muddled 
by fictional portrayals of the conflict. 
In a mildly hypocritical defense, 
Levy rejects these videos as possibly 
truthful because they do not show the 
entire picture. The videographer’s 
choices cannot be trusted, according 
to Levy, though she seems to have 
no problem with her own selective 
criticism of the clips.

Levy’s desire for an objective 

perspective illustrates the underlying 
challenge for a filmmaker like 
Alexandrowicz. 
Objectivity 

is 
impossible 
in 
documentary 

filmmaking, as the videographer is 
always making choices. 

Lana Del Rey’s latest album 

Chemtrails Over The Country Club 
will please longtime fans but feel 
lackluster for everyone else.

The album has all the right 

ingredients for a trademark bombshell-
hit with Del Rey’s deep serenade, 
evocative lyrical writing and tongue-
in-cheek references. Yet, Chemtrails 
stops short of the sharp and powerful 
sociopolitical 
commentary 
of 
its 

predecessor, 
Norman 
Fucking 

Rockwell!, 
and 
the 
emotional 

introspection feels underwhelming 
after Lana Del Rey’s recent gut-punch 
in her spoken word poetry release, 
Violets Bending Over Backwards. 
What’s left is an album that’s good but 
not exciting. 

The title itself perhaps dooms the 

album to mediocrity — “Chemtrails” 
recalls 
the 
popular 
conspiracy 

theory that argues the visible lines of 
condensation an aircraft expels in the 
sky are actually filled with chemicals 
intended to harm the public. In a 
time when the truth is constantly 
under attack from wolf-cries of “fake 
news” and the recent rise of QAnon, 
Chemtrails Over The Country Club 
sets the stage for yet another pointed 
evaluation of American culture. The 
album title manages to capture the 
extremes of American life — from the 
wild conspiracy theories of “Q” to the 
idyllic mundanity of suburban life and 
class privilege — yet fails to build upon 
it. The “wrapping paper” of the album 
is in some respects far more thrilling 
than the contents of the package itself. 

Instead, Del Rey focuses on the 

trials and tribulations of fame. The 
song “Chemtrails Over The Country 
Club” celebrates the freedom of daily 
life, capturing that familiar, obligation-

free serenity of hot summers in 
childhood, where the only thing to do 
was wait for time to pass. Notably, the 
official music video features Del Rey’s 
infamous bedazzled mask, which 
is where we last saw Del Rey on the 
pages of The Michigan Daily.

“Dark But Just a Game” explores 

the hefty price of stardom, describing 
artists as chameleons who are forced 
to change until they eventually lose 
themselves — Del Rey vows to stay 
the same, to preserve herself. “Not 
All Who Wander Are Lost” strikes at 
the heart of the album’s core theme: 
It’s all about perspective. Where 
fame may seem a blessing, it is also a 
burden; when one may appear lost, 
perhaps it’s merely “wanderlust.” 
Beneath the dramatics of chemtrails 
and conspiracies, maybe there lies 
a hidden blessing in celebrating the 
boring, the normal, the straight-and-
narrow condensation trails. 

As a storyteller and songwriter, 

Del Rey excels as always. A 
mediocre album for a powerhouse 
like Del Rey is a far better album 
than another’s best work. Yet, while 
Chemtrails Over The Country Club 
offers a handful of tracks that build 
some engaging commentary, it 
lacks the drive of Del Rey’s previous 
works. Del Rey may have set the 
bar too high for herself — a feat 
which speaks only to her talent and 
celebrated career thus far. 

What holds the album back is 

the lack of stylistic experimentation 
or any fresh, noteworthy material. 
Chemtrails is a shoo-in Lana Del 
Rey album — a blessing and a 
curse. Those who love Del Rey will 
continue to love her, but anyone still 
not convinced will find little here to 
sway them.

The culture of complicity must end

Lana Del Rey’s ‘Chemtrails Over The 
Country Club’ is good, but not great

What first comes to mind when 

you hear the term SoundCloud rap? 
Perhaps you envision an immature 
group of teens with colorfully-dyed 
hair and face tattoos, rapping about 
prescription drugs. Maybe the term 
connotes a sense of rebelliousness that 
brings to mind exciting, unfiltered 
discoveries found on the internet. 
It could remind you of your own 
blunders and self-produced lo-fi beats 
you wish will never see the light of day. 
Regardless of your relationship to the 
genre, it seems that this simple two-
word phrase elicits strong reactions 
from every Gen Z, tech-savvy music 
listener.

However, though mentions of the 

genre are a staple in music discourse, 
defining the short-lived moment of 
SoundCloud rap (often derogatorily 
referred to as mumble rap) is a task 
ranging from arduous to impossible.

During the last decade, the 

audience for the music streaming 
service SoundCloud exploded into the 
hundreds of millions. With a utopian 
vision of accessible music creation 
for the people, SoundCloud became 
a champion for any up-and-coming 
artist. New musicians, without ever 
having to leave their bedroom, gained 
stratospheric stardom, circumventing 
the conventional methods of going to 
professional studios and working with 
record labels. SoundCloud’s design 
is more aligned with social media 
websites than streaming services, 
which lowers the barrier between 
artist and audience. This gave a 
massive advantage to musicians who 
interacted with their fans online. 
Behind the scenes, SoundCloud’s 
unprecedented success shook the 
music industry to its core.

What we think of as SoundCloud 

rap is emblematic of the platform 

it spawned from. With harsh, raw 
instrumentals, 
SoundCloud 
rap 

embodies the DIY nature of its 
platform. Songs like XXXTentacion’s 
“Look at Me” (which currently has 
over 189 million plays on SoundCloud) 
contain blown-out vocals and very 
minimal mixing. Lil Pump’s “Gucci 
Gang” (which peaked at number 
three on Billboard’s Hot 100) trades 
songwriting for the repetition of the 
phrase “Gucci gang” 53 times. For 
outsiders of the genre, this style of 
production may make SoundCloud 
rappers seem lazy and their music 
seem inaccessible, but for fans, this 
amateur aesthetic only heightens the 
listening experience.

These 
rappers, 
boasting 

ostentatious 
personalities, 
mind-

numbing music and underground 
origins may elicit strong parallels to 
the punk movement of the late ’70s 
and early ’80s. Rather ironically, most 
SoundCloud rappers have ditched the 
platform of their namesake and got 
snatched up by large record labels, 
leaving SoundCloud rap to embody the 
spirit of the early punk scene. Where 
punk was a stripped-down, aggressive 
and often nihilistic response to the 
maximalism of mainstream rock, 
SoundCloud rap responded similarly to 
the excess of mainstream hip-hop with 
hostile, anti-authoritarian attitudes. 

SoundCloud rappers are much 

more likely to write songs about 
taking drugs than dealing them, 
and the content of their songs is 
centered around depression and self-
destruction, unlike mainstream rap’s 
obsession with ego inflation.

Similar to punk, SoundCloud 

rappers are overwhelmingly young. 
Many SoundCloud rappers, such as 
Tekashi69, Lil Peep and Ski Mask the 
Slump God, all gained tremendous 
fame before their 18th birthdays. 

I have this one memory that I’m 

not sure is even real. I can vividly see 
my infant self gazing up at our green 
marble countertop, struggling and 
struggling to reach some Flintstones 
vitamins my mom left out. My 
chubby little hands barely reach the 
wood beneath the stone, and then 
suddenly I morph into a bigger (but 
still quite little) four-year-old. Taller 
and smarter, I rise up on my tippy-
toes, swipe up Fred and Barney and 
chomp. 

As ridiculous as it sounds, I feel 

like that actually happened, and 
this has often led me to question the 
true nature of our relationship with 
memory. How much of what we go 
through is real, especially as children? 
What if what we think we remember 
is simply an illusion, a mirage, a false 
memory planted by our malleable 
young minds? For something to truly 
stick, you’d think it would have to be 
important or jarring or memorable. 
That said, Dontnod Entertainment’s 

2020 narrative adventure game “Tell 
Me Why” argues that our pasts are 
much less certain than we have been 
led to believe.

“Tell Me Why” follows Alyson 

and Tyler Ronan as they attempt to 
sell their childhood house 10 years 
after their mother attempted to kill 
them there. By confronting their 
past, they learn everything is not as 
they remember and must dig into 
the mystery behind why Mary-Ann 
Ronan wanted to kill her kids. 

The Ronan siblings possess a 

telekinetic bond that allows them to 
wordlessly communicate with one 
another and replay ancient memories 
in an effort to learn more about 
their tragedy. Over the course of the 
game’s three chapters, the siblings 
will remember an event in two 
very different ways, forcing players 
to decide which events actually 
occurred. Maybe you will trust 
Tyler, a transgender youth sent off 
to Fireweed Residential Center after 
stabbing his “deranged” mother out 
of self-defense. Or maybe you will 
pick Alyson, who grew up under the 
protective eye of the town sheriff and 

was branded “murder house girl” for 
her entire childhood. 

Since Tyler is a member of the 

LGBTQ+ community, the question of 
memory becomes doubly important. 
Can he trace back the memories to 
when he first began to feel dysphoric? 
What about the memories of when 
he realized he was gay? Which 
came first: the gender or the sexual 
orientation? 

In my personal experience, the 

arduous process of self-identification 
began without any build-up, yet 
after accepting my truth, I found 
hints scattered throughout my 
childhood. Old memories that once 
passed by without a second glance 
transformed into small windows 
gazing directly at something within 
me that I had no words to express. 
Where once stood an arid desert 
of 
disconnected 
repression, 
a 

newfound flowing river of memory 
ran freely. 

When examined, these hints make 

it intensely clear how inevitable and 
natural my current identity is — I was 
just remembering things wrong. I 
was always meant to find myself and 

live this truth; it simply took 20 years 
of experience for me to realize it. 

For 
those 
in 
the 
LGBTQ+ 

community, the issue becomes not 
only trusting but identifying with the 
past versions of ourselves — someone 
who feels miles away from who we 
are now, but we know at one point 
we stood there, in their shoes, living 
their “normal” experience. Tyler 
faces this dilemma constantly: He is 
not the same person he was 10 years 
ago, yet he must unearth the causes 
of what happened in order to finally 
let go.

In the end, it doesn’t matter which 

memories you choose in a particular 
playthrough of “Tell Me Why.” Sure 
it will impact Alyson and Tyler, but 
each playthrough acts as our own 
memory of the game; each person’s 
journey will be different and personal 
with distinctly hard to recall details. 
What “Tell Me Why” wants players to 
understand is that the past is the past, 
and that “the second you walk away 
from something, that’s it.” The past is 
what we want it to be right now.

Where once stood Ollie Ronan 

— an earlier assumed name, the 

game thankfully never deadnames 
Tyler — the sister who felt more like 
a brother, now stands Tyler Ronan, 
all bearded out and confident in 
his masculinity. We cannot change 
what happened in the past, just 
as we cannot stop ourselves from 
remembering a certain way. So, 
unless your version of events will 
harm someone, it’s okay to pick 
something as truth.

Even if it didn’t happen, I choose 

to believe that I had a sudden growth 
spurt and aged a few years, and 
that’s my first memory. It’s weird 

and stupid and makes zero sense, 
so it’s absolutely perfect for me to 
identify with. I’m sure that years 
from now, I’ll look back at my time 
here at the University of Michigan 
and my writing for The Daily and see 
things that are different from how I 
remember them. And that’s okay.

The important things right now 

may fade into the background to 
make room for something smaller 
and more personal, something that 
means more to me in the future. I 
look forward to understanding what 
that is.

Directed by Paulette Phillips 

(“The 
Directed 
Lie”), 
“The 

Quoddy Fold” first feels like an 
adaptation of a Mary Oliver poem. 
The film, showcased in this year’s 
Ann Arbor Film Festival, takes a 
“Koyaanisqatsi”-esque 
approach 

to documentary filmmaking; the 
director films herself over the 
course of the year as she tears down 
a 19th-century home — that she 
bought for this specific purpose — 
in rural Nova Scotia, Canada. The 
only dialogue heard is from quiet 

eavesdropping of the director’s 
phone conversations or a moment 
when she reads the title of a book 
to herself, there is no musical score 
or soundtrack at all. Early on in the 
film, it felt like a thoughtful ode to 
the nature of decay. 

“The Quoddy Fold” also features 

some 
beautiful 
cinematography 

juxtaposing the rotten wood of the 
house with the lush fields of cattails 
and wildflowers. The director 
seems to want the viewer to pay 
attention: to watch closely and let us 
make the story for ourselves rather 
than have it explained to us.

In 
the 
post-screening 
Q&A 

moderated by Amanda Krugliak, 

assistant director of the University 
of Michigan’s Institute for the 
Humanities, Phillips explained that 
she actively exercised restraint in 
introducing any sentimentality — or 
any narrative at all — into the home. 

At times, the film feels incredibly 

meditative. Watching these shots 
of birds, snails, dogs and insects, I 
got the feeling that animals seem 
to understand life in a way we 
don’t: live, work, eat, multiply, die. 
Anything else is simply excess. 
Don’t get caught up in the small 
stuff.

When Phillips and her two dogs 

walk through a field, she layers the 
two frames of them walking toward 
the house and away from the house 
on top of one another, giving the 
figures 
this 
translucent 
ghost 

effect of walking past one another. 
Krugliak observed that it seems 
to symbolize a sense of the “past 
blurring into the present.” Phillips 
agreed that our experience of time 
and “what it means to dwell” were 
major components of the “story” 
during production. 

Unfortunately, 
creative 

intentions and thoughtful sound 
bites can’t save a film. I felt myself 
getting increasingly bored — not 
just because there wasn’t any 
dialogue, but because the film didn’t 
seem to know what it wanted to say. 

It would’ve been fantastic as a short 
film, or maybe even a traditional 
documentary that included more 
exploration of the families behind 
the home.

Phillips adamantly rejected this 

“typical anthropomorphizing” of 
the home, declaring, “I did not want 
to make a movie about that family,” 
but she doesn’t really explain 
why. I understand her inclination 
to explore what she calls the 
“kinesthetic experience” we have 
with material objects — meaning 
the way that our sense of touch 
influences our attachment to our 
possessions — but as a Black woman 
watching a white woman tear down 
this house with so much history, I 
couldn’t help but feel frustrated.

There’s a moment about two-

thirds of the way through the film 
when Phillips finds a copy of the 
book “The Great War on White 
Slavery.” She reads the title aloud 
to herself in a whisper before 
throwing it into the furnace to 
burn. Of course, I understand the 
rejection of something hateful, 
but from white hands, it felt like 
erasure. It was clearly a very old 
copy of the book, with authentic 
photographs 
that 
would 
have 

been useful in a museum rather 
than destroyed. Trying to erase 
records of colonization and white 

supremacy feels cowardly. People 
don’t study “Birth of a Nation” 
because we think it’s a great or 
morally sound film, because it’s 
clearly neither; we study it because 
it’s a part of history, and the racism 
that lived in history lives on today.

I felt the same way about the 

house. There were clearly rotted 
and moldy portions of the home, but 
there also appeared to be healthy 
portions of the foundation that 
she just tore down. Phillips herself 
said that there were times that she 
thought, “Maybe I can save (the 
house),” admitting that “it would’ve 
stayed standing for an awful long 
time,” if she had not intervened.

Her intentions then feel rotten. 

She clearly shows knowledge of 
the land there, explaining the 
indigenous meaning of the word 
“quoddy” (an excess of fish) and 
the image of folding in on the 
landscape. She explained this “post-
colonial notion … that the settler 
house is the house of the past, we’re 
actually on a positive way towards 
a new horizon,” and to a better 
relationship with the land. 

I think Phillips felt that tearing 

down a building where some white 
supremacist had lived would be a 
way of honoring Indigenous people 
who had been displaced from that 
land, but I couldn’t help but think: 

“Someone else could have lived 
in that house.” It could’ve been 
repurposed or given to Indigenous 
people in need, not just torn down 
for an art project.

Phillips said she found over 

38 diaries in the home when she 
acquired it in 2015. The photographs 
shown near the climax of the film 
as the house is pulled to the ground 
are the most intriguing section of 
the film. Delving into the lives of 
all of the people in the photographs 
from the turn of the century might 
have seemed cliché to Phillips, but 
it would’ve made for a better film. 
It seemed as if Phillips was looking 
for a creative challenge in removing 
the sentimental aspect of the home, 
rather than respecting what it 
meant to people. Getting rid of that 
narrative felt like erasure. 

It seemed that Phillips didn’t 

want the film to over-explain 
itself. 
There’s 
a 
saying 
that 

explaining a joke, story or symbol 
is like dissecting a frog: It helps you 
understand it better, but you kill it in 
the process.

In “The Quoddy Fold,” she 

smashes the frog with a hammer, 
turns to the camera, then says, 
“What do you think?” Ultimately, 
the film looks beautiful, but it’s 
shallow. Honestly, she should have 
just let the frog live.

YOUR WEEKLY

ARIES

We start this week in quite a 
feel-good, cooperative mood, with a 
helpful Venus-Mars sextile on Tuesday 
which encourages good personal 
interactions and a friendly, sociable 

vibe across society.

AQUARIUS

GEMINI

The problem with goals this week is 
that they keep shifting, Gemini. Your 
priorities are changing, and your 
objectives are changing too, so it’s 
very tricky for you to know whether 
you’re on the right track or not.

SAGITTARIUS

CAPRICORN

SCORPIO

CANCER

Your dreams have a lot to teach you 
this week, Cancer. It’s an excellent 
time to start a dream journal or to 
look into dream imagery. What is 
your subconscious trying to tell you? 

Synchronicity may play a large part 

in your week too, so look 
out for odd coincidences.

TAURUS

Friendships could be difficult this 
week, Taurus, particularly if there is a 
large gap in money or social status 
between you. Someone may feel left 
out, or as if you are not bothering with 

them, despite your best 
intentions.

VIRGO

PISCES

LIBRA
LEO

In love, you may be lulled into a false 
sense of security early in the week. 
Any issues of jealousy or infidelity 
have not gone away, despite the 
smiles.

Read your weekly horoscopes from astrology.tv

There’s conflict and tension this week 
between your working life and
your home life, and in particular your 
love life. You may feel upset or taken 
for granted if your partner complains 

about your work ethic – but 

are you really doing all 
that you can to create a 
better work-life balance?

You’re more prone than most to falling 
into this week’s lazy, somewhat
stubborn vibe, Libra, so it may be hard 
for you to get up to speed. Friday’s 
Mars-Neptune square highlights how 

your idealistic goals suffer 

when you can’t get the day 
to day details right. 

Are you sure that you’re telling the 
truth, the whole truth and nothing but 
the truth? There’s a deceptive vibe 
going on this week, particularly 
around your closest relationship.

The focus is definitely on your home 
and family life this week, although 
what starts as a gentle enough vibe 
could very well prove more stressful 
as the week progresses.

At work, there’s an elusive, vague vibe 
that hinders you from getting much 
done. Despite your best efforts, 
details go astray, deadlines are 
missed, and people just don’t seem to 

be pulling their weight.

Your stubborn nature is highlighted 
this week and it seems that you are
determined to do things your way or 
not at all. The influence of Friday’s 
Mars-Neptune square pervades the 
week, and for you, this is all about 

risk-taking versus security, 
especially with money and 
material matters. 

This is not an easy week for getting 
much done, which is frustrating – you 
had plans, and you have deadlines, 
and your self-confidence is riding on 
creating a success this week. Hang on 
in there. Just do what you can, step 

by step.

8 — Wednesday, April 7, 2021 

Ann Arbor is never entirely 

quiet. But of the many sounds 
you hear drifting through the 
city, those of a band with a bossa 
nova feel often aren’t among 
them. And yet, on a slightly chilly 
Saturday afternoon, a group of 
around 40 people and I found 
ourselves masked up and spread 
out, sprawled all over Lawrence 
Street as a jazz/rock band played 
on the porch of a yellow house. 
Perching on curbs, leaning against 
buildings, standing on porches and 
roofs, audience members lounged 
and danced and tapped their feet, 
clapping along. Most were dressed 
in the colorful, artsy way typical 
of the creatives of Kerrytown. 
Someone with pink hair danced 
loosely 
and 
expressively, 
and 

the musicians joked with the 
audience. There was a communal 
atmosphere, 
the 
feeling 
that 

everyone gathered there were 
friends or friends of friends. 

It is the musicians who reside in 

this house who came up with the 
idea of sharing their music with 
their neighbors and whoever else 
feels inclined to come. Their porch 
concerts have been occurring 
weekly — Saturdays at 2 p.m. — 
on their porch at the corner of 
State Street and Lawrence Street. 
Members who live in this house 
are in the band Kektus, a funk 
band made up of School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance jazz students. 
However, each week they bring a 
guest from the local scene to jam 
with them, or some of their own 
friends to sit in, and share a wider 
variety of music. It is a mindset 
typical of the jazz community, 
which is all about learning from 
other musicians by playing and 
hanging with them. 

The band of five — a mix of 

household members and friends 
— stuck close together on their 
makeshift stage, communicating 
steadily with nods, calls and 
twists of expression. Ann Arbor 
locals Mei Semones and Reggie 
Pearl (both on guitar, alternating 

lead vocals) led the band, taking 
turns singing a mix of each of 
their originals and covers that the 
crowd sang along with. Supporting 
them were Music, Theatre & 
Dance sophomores Ben Wood 
(on bass) and Sam Uribe (various 
percussive instruments). Addie 
Vogt — who currently lives in Ann 
Arbor but attends The New School 
in New York — plays drums. The 
singers, although clearly close and 
very good at combining creatively, 
had distinct styles.

Semones 
sang 
in 
tones 

classically described as “silvery.” 
Her voice seemed to float and skip 
where it pleased, with the breeze 
sometimes carrying it past the ears 
of the eager listeners. Her original 
songs carried a gentle bossa nova 
to them and worked their way 
into the in-between feeling that 
comes early in a partially cloudy 
afternoon.

Meanwhile, Pearl’s music took 

on the anger of punk with the 
education of a jazz musician. The 
snake-like fluidity of her voice 
recalled 
Australian 
musician 

Jaala, 
while 
her 
yowls 
and 

yelps evoked American singer-
songwriter, Angel Olsen, at her 
most fearsome. When asked about 
her music writing process, Pearl 
replied, laughing, “I feel like it’s 
just like, life happens and then I 
sit in my room and write about 
it.” To hear such a powerful voice 
switch to a light, laid-back tone is 
a shock that always comes when 
hearing creatives speak about 
their everyday selves.

And yet, even with such separate 

music emerging from their writing 
process, the two clicked deeply 
and musically. Olsen and Pearl 
met at Berklee School of Music in 
Boston. They were able to fasten 
onto each other and combine their 
voices without ever overpowering 
the other. Semones’s bleached 
pixie cut, both of their chain 
jewelry all serve to set them apart 
from typical jazz musicians. The 
other players, two University of 
Michigan students and another 
Ann Arbor local, found their 
groove in the band too, having fun 
and performing in a way that came 

naturally. This was music played 
for the love of music, and the love 
of sharing it.

“What are you hoping people 

get out of this?” I asked, and 
immediately, 
Vogt 
cried 
out, 

“Happiness!” She went on to 
explain the sudden influx of 
audience members that occurred 
halfway through the first song, as 
people were drawn to the tunes 
from all over the neighborhood. 

Since there weren’t any other 

gigs to be had, Wood said they 
figured they’d play on their porch 
and see who came. “And people 

ended up coming,” he shrugged 
with a modest laugh. As the 
concert ended, friends called up 
to the porch, shouting hello and 
finding joy in reconnecting after 
a long winter spent in quarantine.

“Live music is amazing!” they 

all passionately agreed in their last 
statements. “Every Saturday at 2 
(p.m.) at the corner of Lawrence 
and State!” Listen for drums, 
guitars, possibly a horn. You can’t 
miss it.

In the meantime, you can find 

music by Mei Semones and Reggie 
Pearl on all streaming platforms.

The India-Pakistan Partition 

of 1947 was one of the deadliest 
religious genocides of modern 
history. The conflict left upwards 
of one million people dead and 
more than 15 million as refugees. 
Many 
Partition 
stories 
have 

been 
passed 
down 
through 

word of mouth, but others have 
disappeared entirely after more 
than 60 years. Consequently, 
despite the decades-long violence, 
very few people outside of the 
Indian 
subcontinent 
know 

about the lingering trauma that 
Partition has left on generations 
of South Asians. 

Author Anjali Enjeti hopes to 

change that with her upcoming 
fiction 
release 
“The 
Parted 

Earth.” The novel, set to be 
released on May 4, rescues the 
dying and forgotten stories of 
Partition. 

“What happens when we lose 

so many stories from a significant 

world event? We lose so much 
when we lose our family histories, 
when we lose our stories, when 
we don’t know the struggles of 
our ancestors,” Enjeti said in an 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily.

The Partition occurred in 1947. 

India had just won independence 
from the British Empire, its 
colonizers of 200 years. Before 
they retreated, the British Empire 
drew boundary lines separating 
Hindu-majority 
India 
and 

Muslim-majority Pakistan. The 
subsequent 
religious 
genocide 

was brutal. Muslims fled to West 
Pakistan (present-day Pakistan) 
and East Pakistan (present-day 
Bangladesh), while Hindus fled 
to the Indian states of Punjab 
and West Bengal. Animosity and 
tension grew between Hindus and 
Muslims, leading to widespread 
riots 
and 
targeted 
violence. 

This persecution continued for 
decades. 

“The Parted Earth” follows 

multiple characters who have all 
felt the effects of Partition: Deepa, 

a high school girl who leaves her 
home of New Delhi for London in 
1947; Shan, a lawyer with a broken 
marriage and a deep desire to 
know her displacement-riddled 
roots; 
Chandani, 
an 
elderly 

woman whose husband, also a 
victim of the Partition, recently 
committed suicide. The novel is 
a 
gripping, 
multi-generational 

story of families who must come 
to terms with their displacement.

“Partition 
is 
not 
just 
an 

event that just happened in the 
subcontinent,” Enjeti said. “These 
survivors, their children, their 
grandchildren, migrated to other 
continents and countries. They 
set up their lives elsewhere. These 
stories go with them.”

My family, with generational 

roots in West Bengal, has its own 
Partition stories. My grandfather 
crossed 
the 
border 
from 

Bangladesh to India in 1957 when 
he was just 18 years old, to avoid 
persecution as a Hindu. He arrived 
at a safe house in Kolkata where 
he met my grandmother, who 
had also fled from Bangladesh to 
India when she was six years old. 
Her father had been a doctor in 
Bangladesh, but left with his family 
in 1950 after hearing rumors that 
neighborhood mobs were planning 
to murder his family that night. 

My grandparents married and 

have lived in Kolkata ever since. 
I consider myself especially lucky 
to have heard my grandfather’s 
story before he passed away last 
November. Yet, what happens to 
the stories that are hidden and 
never told?

Enjeti’s fascination with the 

Partition started in the ’90s. At 
the time, she was a lawyer and 

a mother. After encountering 
Salman Rushdie’s 1981 Booker 
Prize 
winner 
“Midnight’s 

Children,” Enjeti read anything 
and 
everything 
she 
could 

about Partition. “I just started 
voraciously reading every book 
I could get my hands on,” Enjeti 
said. 

When the internet became 

a household commodity in the 
mid-’90s, some of Enjeti’s first 
searches were about the Partition. 
She wasn’t getting far until she 
discovered the 1947 Partition 
Archive years later, one of the first 
widespread initiatives to make 
Partition stories accessible. Yet, 
the 1947 Partition Archive was 
founded in 2011, more than 60 
years after the actual event. 

“What really got me was that 

it had been so long, so much time 
had passed, and so many survivors 
would have passed away,” Enjeti 
said. “I wanted to emphasize not 
just Partition, but the legacy of 
Partition and how it affects the 
generations of people that follow.”

Enjeti’s perspective on the 

Partition 
is 
rich 
and 
hard-

hitting. In choosing a fictional 
approach, she puts a human face 
on the turbulence and trauma 
of Partition while remaining 
historically 
accurate. 
Enjeti 

doesn’t skirt around the violence 
of those long decades, but she 
does 
handle 
the 
devastation 

with a grace that enhances the 
plot. Readers are compelled to 
understand Partition from the 
eyes of a child and a middle-aged 
woman. “A river of apprehension 
flowed between homes not even 
one meter apart,” Enjeti writes. 
Even a child can understand that 
level of hostility. 

Enjeti’s novel has a nonlinear 

timescale, jumping between the 
past and present, from continent 
to continent. This model has been 
echoed by contemporary writers 
such as Khaled Hosseini, Jhumpa 
Lahiri, Jess Walter and Tatiana 
de Rosnay, all of whom influenced 
Enjeti’s writing. Enjeti, however, 
stands out in her graceful and 
digestible writing style. “The 
Parted Earth” is a much easier 
read than Hosseini’s “The Kite 
Runner,” for example, but still 
manages to explore themes of 
death 
and 
destruction 
with 

comparable depth.

But “The Parted Earth” isn’t 

just about the Partition. It’s also 
about family roots, ancestry and 
reclaiming a lost culture. This 
theme is personal for Enjeti. She 
grew up with an Indian father and 
a half-Puerto Rican, half-Austrian 
mother. With only half of her 
family in India, Enjeti felt distant 
from the Indian subcontinent, 
especially 
when 
she 
stopped 

visiting regularly after college. All 
of her relatives moved out of India 
when Enjeti was in her 20s, and 
she returned only years later for 
her cousin’s wedding.

“We 
were 
attending 
the 

wedding as tourists,” Enjeti said. 
“That was a jarring experience 
for me, to return to India and 
have virtually no family left 
there.” 

Enjeti felt she’d truly lost her 

connection with the Indian side of 
her family when her grandmother 
passed away. “I didn’t make the 
effort to know her stories and 
know her better while she was 
alive,” Enjeti said. “That regret, 
that guilt of her not getting to 
meet her great-grandkids before 

she passed, just really sat so heavy 
on me. Part of the book came out 
of that feeling.” 

Reclaiming 
one’s 
culture, 

discovering 
lost 
stories, 

reckoning 
with 
generational 

displacement — these concepts 
are hard to come to terms with. 
For anyone looking to delve 
deeper into their familial roots, 
Enjeti 
recommends 
starting 

with women in your family. 
“In most cultures, it is the 
matriarchs who hold the stories 
of their communities. They are 
the keepers of the stories, the 
archivists,” Enjeti said.

Personally, 
when 
I 
think 

back to my own grandma, who 
showers me with Bengali clothes 
and jewelry when she visits 
Michigan, I find that Enjeti’s 
words 
ring 
true. 
Fittingly, 

nearly all the narrators in “The 
Parted Earth” are women. Enjeti 
weaves together her own story 
with those of powerful female 
characters who have lost or 
become estranged from the men 
in their lives. “The women are 
our histories. They are the most 
authentic histories,” Enjeti said. 

“The 
Parted 
Earth” 
is 
a 

powerful 
story 
about 
the 

Partition, but it’s also much more 
than that. Enjeti intertwines 
themes of displacement, heritage 
and reclamation to show us the 
power of family ties in less than 
250 pages. The novel makes me 
want to preserve my own family’s 
Partition stories: to savor them, 
write them down or tell my 
children about them someday. 

“The Parted Earth” carries 

the strength of generations on its 
shoulders. It isn’t a light read, but 
it’s an important one.

Ever since being in a room with 

more than six people and human 
contact were substituted by life 
through a screen, culture has 
sought ways to continue blooming 
despite the circumstances. The 
Zell Visiting Writers Series has 
found a way to keep literature alive 
by switching real-life interactions 
between writers and readers 
to remote Q&As with authors 
from the University of Michigan 
community and beyond.

This 
past 
Thursday, 
the 

program hosted author Kathleen 
Graber, 
whose 
last 
poetry 

collection, The Eternal City, was 
a finalist for the National Book 
Award and the National Book 
Critics Circle Award. Graber came 
to talk about her 2019 book, The 
River Twice, a collection of poems 
described as “lyric philosophy, 
and a supreme consolation” by 
Pulitzer Prize winner Tracy K. 
Smith.

While she sat in front of her 

bookshelf (a very nice bookshelf, 
by the way), I sat on my balcony 
with a cup of Rooibos tea in my 
hand, as I’ve been doing ever since 
Ann Arbor started teasing us with 
warmer weather. 

The event began with University 

of Michigan graduate student 
and Poetry MFA candidate Sara 

Afshar, who softly set the scene 
by introducing the author and her 
writings: a river, America and the 
flux of all things.

As a poetry lover myself, I was 

hooked from the beginning. The 
tea tasted sweet on my tongue as 
I was brought back to a topic from 
my favorite philosophy class in 
high school: the pre-Socratics. 
These ancient Greek philosophers 
thought that changelessness is the 
nature of all reality and that all 
can be explained within the realm 
of rationality and the physical 
world. 

After that prelude, Graber began 

reading off of her latest collection 
of poems, which takes on the 
ancient philosopher Heraclitus’s 
protean notion of change in the 
title and the opening epigraphs: 
“No man ever steps in the same 
river twice, for it’s not the same 
river, and he’s not the same man.” 
According to him, change isn’t a 
part of life: It is life itself. 

Her first poem placed the 

listener in a Richmond, Va., thrift 
store where everything costs a 
dollar, except on Mondays and 
Fridays, when everything costs 
only 50 cents. She talks about an 
interaction between a mother and 
a child in one of the aisles, about 
unemployment and about the 
melting ice caps, or, in her own 
words, “a harmony of tensions.”

She then picked up The Eternal 

City, her 2010 book inspired by yet 

another historical figure: Marcus 
Aurelius. I found these selections 
especially delightful as the vivid 
storytelling transported me to 
every curtain she rose. I loved the 
simplicity in some of her lines, 
which I have always preferred 
to a pretentious concatenation of 
words, deluged with the author’s 
hopeless 
hyperbolizing. 
You 

hated that last bit, right? My point 
exactly. 

“After my mother died, I 

expected to die myself,” “We were 
not written to be saved,” “How 
slowly time seems to pass when 
you are waiting.” These are some 
of the lines that I noted to savor 
after the webinar ended. 

I was surprised to find out that 

Graber had only embarked on 
her journey of publishing poetry 
twenty years ago, at the age of 
forty. She recalls having low 
expectations for herself, thinking 
she was likely to fail. But it was 
precisely this that allowed her 
words to flow unrestrained, like a 
liberation. Graber also mentioned 
the familiar feeling that you are 
writing the same thing repeatedly, 
but it was Heraclitus’s notion that 
salvaged her unease: The topic 
may be the same, but the context 
and yourself have undergone 
some sort of change since the last 
instance. In other words, it will 
never intrinsically be the same. 

This 
made 
me 
smile 
and 

simultaneously 
served 
as 
a 

reassurance. I like to write songs, 
but lately, I had been getting 
stuck in the conviction that 
what I was writing wasn’t any 
different, or any better, from what 
I (and others) had written before. 
Heraclitus came back into my life 
when I needed him most, and I 
have Kathleen Graber to thank for 
that. 

The webinar turned to a Q&A 

with the audience, orchestrated by 
MFA candidate Julia McDaniel, 
who began with some questions of 

her own. These questions revealed 
more about what went into the 
process of writing The River 
Twice and served as an insight 
into the more intimate aspects of 
Graber’s life and psyche, like the 
enduring “love” for Heraclitus 
she’s had since she was a teenager, 
for his illuminating Buddhist 
overtones and for leaving her with 
things to write about.

Attending the Zell Writers 

Series was a nice way to break 
from 
the 
mundanity 
of 
my 

academic routine. From my small 
Ann Arbor apartment, in between 
my last class of the day and the 
gym appointment I booked days 
in advance, I was able to indulge 
in the witty words of Kathleen 
Graber, a poet I was unfamiliar 
with but one I look forward to 
discovering more about. 

I took away many thing, but 

most importantly, solace for my 
lingering solipsistic thoughts. As 
Graber said, “the self is a nebulous, 
shifty thing.”

L

ike so many other universities 
around the world, the University 
of Michigan relied on its existing 

technological resources to design a dis-
tanced education for the COVID-19 era. 
The pandemic certainly came as a sur-
prise, though ultimately a widespread 
familiarity with the basic tools of email, 
course websites and video conferencing 
helped students and teachers adapt to a 
new normal.

Online education in general, how-

ever, is not a new phenomenon, nor is 
it likely to disappear with the return of 
in-person instruction.

In fact, the prevailing narrative is 

that the pandemic has catalyzed an in-
evitable shift to online learning. The 
World Economic Forum called the pan-
demic a “paradigm shift” for colleges 
and universities that has “accelerated 
the transformation of higher educa-
tion.” Similarly, Byeongwoo Kang of 
the Institute of Innovation Research, 
Hitotsubashi University, Tokyo, wrote 
in an article published by the National 
Center for Biotechnology Innovation 
that, although the expansion of distance 
learning was advancing steadily in Ja-
pan, “COVID-19 has accelerated digital 
transformation in the education sector.”

Lots of people are saying that chang-

es to higher education are accelerating, 
but what is higher education accelerat-
ing towards?

Online education is the present re-

ality for most residential students, but 
for many others, it has represented and 
continues to represent a viable avenue 
for expanding access to higher educa-
tion. While thinking ahead about the 
future of education in general, I began 
to wonder: How will the University 
contribute to the expansion of opportu-
nities to learn and seek a degree in the 
post-pandemic era?

***
B

ehind the hype around online 
education are the researchers, 
designers and engineers who 

are making it happen. Here at the Uni-
versity, the Center for Academic Inno-
vation is one organization dedicated to 
the design of educational technologies 
and to supporting faculty who want to 
integrate digital components into their 
classrooms.

Recently, Sarah Dysart, the center’s 

director of hybrid and online programs, 
and Lauren Atkins Budde, director of 
open learning initiatives, filled me in on 
the workings of the center and how it 
has been pursuing its mission of design-
ing the education of the future.

During our Zoom conversation, Dys-

art explained how the initiative to found 
a dedicated office for academic innova-
tion formed in response to popular de-
mand for online learning opportunities. 
In 2012, the online learning platform 
Coursera began to offer its first batch 
of massive online open courses, avail-
able to anyone with a browser and an 
internet connection. The University 
was one of Coursera’s first partner in-
stitutions and helped co-create some of 
its first MOOCs, including “Python for 
Everybody,” which is consistently one 
of the most popular courses on the plat-
form. This collaboration served as the 
impetus for the creation of the Office 
of Digital Education and Innovation in 
2014, the institutional ancestor of what 
is now CAI.

Today, the center has the dual role of 

supporting the University’s non-credit 
and credit-bearing online programs. 
Some of the not-for-credit learning pro-
grams include MOOCs, specializations, 
Teach-outs, podcasts and other forms 
of widely available educational content. 
“We have, I think, almost 15 million en-
rollments from learners of over 200 dif-
ferent countries that engage with our 
learning experiences,”’ Budde said. 

Dysart, on the other hand, manages 

the programs that are eligible for U-M 
credits or have a pathway to earning 
them. This includes several online mas-
ter’s degrees programs, as well as pro-
grams that learners can begin as open 
experiences and then convert to credit 
later on. “Anytime somebody is convert-

ing an open learning experience into a 
for-credit initiative,” Dysart explained. 
“Like taking content from a MOOC 
course and then applying it to a residen-
tial course, that’s often a time when I’d 
be pulled in.”

Along with an array of software de-

veloped for U-M students, the center 
has been instrumental in helping dif-
ferent schools at the University develop 
online courses and master’s programs 
that can reach a broader audience of 
worldwide learners.

The School of Information, for ex-

ample, offers a “Master of Applied Data 
Science” online on Coursera. The on-
line curriculum is designed to be flex-
ible and accommodate learners who 
have to balance school with other major 
responsibilities. While the residential 
Master of Science in Information pro-
gram requires students enroll in a mini-
mum of nine credits to be a full-time 
student, the courses in the MADS pro-
gram are one-credit each, and students 
take an average of one asynchronous 
credit per month. The workload, there-
fore, is more spread out over time, even 
though students can still expect to finish 
the degree in an average of two years.

One of the major challenges of on-

line programs is fostering a sense of 
community. For MOOCs, online discus-
sion forums provide the bulk of interac-
tions between learners and U-M faculty. 

“You’ve probably experienced for 

large classes on campus how hard it is 
for a professor to really connect with, 
say, the 500 students they might have in 
their CHEM 125 section,” Budde said. 
“Imagine if that instructor had 10,000 
students every semester: That’s the 
scale that you’re looking at for those 
sorts of online courses.”

To support online learners, an in-

ternal team at CAI helps out with the 
Coursera courses. Additionally, though, 
some faculty members have made spe-
cial efforts to connect with their stu-
dents; Budde even told me about a few 
professors who in pre-COVID-19 times 
held pop-up office hours in local coffee 
shops while they were traveling around 
the world.

While online learning at-first-glance 

seems to be all about the technology, 
there is clearly a human component 
that is crucial to the success of any on-
line venture, whether it’s a course or a 
full degree.

***
D

esigning the future, then, is 
not about designing the per-
fect tools, but about ensuring 

that lots of different aspects of the learn-
ing experience are taken into account. 
So, along with engineers, it is the job of 
educational researchers to think about 
how these digital tools can be applied to 
academic contexts.

To learn more about the work of an 

academic researcher, I talked with Juan 
D. Pinto, an alum of the center’s Learn-
ing Experience and Design Graduate 
Certificate program.

Pinto earned his master’s in educa-

tion studies from the School of Educa-
tion in 2020 and completed the cer-
tificate program as part of his degree. 
He is currently pursuing a doctorate in 
the Digital Environments for Learning, 
Teaching & Agency program at the Uni-
versity of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 
and is especially interested in the appli-
cations of artificial intelligence to edu-
cational technologies.

As one might expect, Pinto is no pes-

simist about the possibility for technol-
ogy to make a positive impact in the 
lives of learners. However, he admitted 
to me during our conversation that his 
field had lost its way when it comes to 
the successful integration of education-
al technology. 

“I’ll be honest with you,” Pinto said 

during our phone call. “I think educa-
tional technology as a whole has failed. 
The more I learn about it, the more I 
study it, the more I feel like we are fail-
ing.”

Part of the reason for this failure, 

Pinto explained, has to do with the 
overhype and profit motive of the tech-
nology industry. However, he also made 
clear that his own field of educational 
research needs to make more concerted 
efforts to reach out to the communities 
they are trying to support with their 
work.

“It’s much more than just, ‘I study 

how people learn in a lab, and then I 
design a technology that I think will 
be beneficial,” Pinto clarified about the 
goal of his research. “There has to be so 
much more that goes into it and actu-
ally implementing it in context, so that 
it makes sense for a specific school, spe-
cific classrooms, and specific students 
to use. And we have to make sure that 
we’re not leaving people behind because 
right now we are, we definitely are.”
Pinto pointed out, for example, that the 
accelerated adoption of technologies 
during the pandemic has reinforced ex-
isting structural inequalities in access to 
education. While technological innova-
tion is often framed in terms of broad-
ening access, digital technology just 
won’t have this effect as long as there 
are significant deficits in reliable access 
to the Internet and computers.

Because of the ambiguous relation-

ship between technologies and educa-
tional outcomes, Pinto advocates the 
fostering of a critical approach toward 
the design and implementation of new 
educational technologies.

One component of this critical ap-

proach is the examination of algorithms 
and their relationships with human 

subjects. Most technology companies, 
however, do not disclose information 
related to proprietary algorithms, con-
stituting a major obstacle to an open and 
equitable digital future.

“The problem with proprietary soft-

ware or proprietary algorithms is that 
essentially they can do anything,” Pinto 
said on the issue of algorithmic trans-
parency. “And because the technology 
has developed so quickly over recent 
years, the government, legislators, and 
policymakers just can’t keep up.”

The algorithms used in AI, for ex-

ample — are susceptible to reproduc-
ing biases due to their design or the 
data on which the algorithms train. 
For example, a report from The Brook-
ings Institution showed how the use of 
AI in schools threatens to reproduce 
racial discrimination associated with 
standardized testing. Thus, if schools 
contract with companies that protect 
their algorithms as trade secrets, then 
it might be costly to hold these compa-
nies accountable in the event that their 
products cause harm.

The future of online education, then, 

is ideally rooted in accountability, trans-
parency and active engagement with 
local communities. However, in the ab-
sence of close regulatory scrutiny, it is 
up to public and private institutions to 
exercise proper care when considering 
the introduction of a new dimension of 
their online educational infrastructure.

***
S

o, as the University continues to 
hurtle into the future, its admin-
istrators, researchers and faculty 

must also continue to think critically 
about the relationship between tech-
nological change and equal access to 
higher education. The future is not set 
in stone, and what we do now, in large 
part, forms the kind of people and the 
kind of university we will be.

The stakes are high, too, because the 

university is still dealing with an iden-
tity crisis that technology alone cannot 
solve, but in which technology will in-
deed play an outsized role. This identity 
crisis stems from the tension between 
the University’s contemporary self-pre-
sentation as an elite university on the 
international stage, and roots as a public 
university, for which a major goal is to 
serve the people of the state that bears 
its name.

The 17th Edition of the Michigan 

Almanac, published in March 2021, re-
ports that, based on data from Fall 2018, 
53% of incoming first-years were from 
in-state, 43% were from out-of-state 
and 4% were international students. 
The University enrolls a lower percent-
age of in-state students than most other 
public schools, but the University pro-
vides an explanation: “In large part this 
is because U-M’s primary competitors 

for these students are selective private 
universities.”

To be sure, the University’s interna-

tional reputation helps attract young 
professionals and growing businesses to 
the state. The expansion of U-M-spon-
sored online education can therefore 
continue to play a role in brightening 
the University’s brand in an increasingly 
competitive landscape. 

As an out-of-state student, though, 

the above statistic and its subsequent 
justification have never sat well with 
me. In my view, their combined im-
plication does not reflect well on the 
University as an institution of public 
service, even if at-first-blush it seems 
like a badge of honor to declare yourself 
a “competitor” of Harvard University, 
Stanford University, the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, the University 
of Chicago and the other universities 
that tend to follow.

At least from a fiscal perspective, 

the public character of the University 
has decreased dramatically since the 
1960s: in 1960, state funding accounted 
for 78% of the U-M Ann Arbor General 
Fund budget, whereas in 2020 state 
funding accounted for only 14% of the 
General Fund. (In FY 2020, the General 
Fund accounted for around 24% of the 
total budget). All in all, state funding, 
therefore, accounts for around 3-4% of 
the total budget.

The trend of declining state fund-

ing has been associated with increas-
ing tuition, as well as efforts to find 
alternative revenue streams such as on-
line learning. Nevertheless, even if the 
University does not have strong finan-
cial ties to the state, it does have strong 
cultural and historical ones. These are 
written into the word-order of the Uni-
versity’s mission“to serve the people of 
Michigan and the world through pre-
eminence in creating, communicating, 
preserving and applying knowledge, 
art, and academic values, and in de-
veloping leaders and citizens who will 
challenge the present and enrich the 
future.”

I think a good example of this public-

spiritedness is encoded in “Python for 
Everybody,” the Coursera course taught 
by Information professor Dr. Charles 
Severance.

One of Severance’s goals in develop-

ing the course has been to make sure 
the course materials are accessible to 
the widest range of learners possible. 
When he says, “Python for Everybody,” 
he means it. His courses are accessible 
to people with vision problems, for 
example, because he takes care to in-
tegrate storytelling as a part of his lec-
tures, turning visual aids such as graphs, 
charts and diagrams into rich verbal 
descriptions. His most basic Python 
course, too, does not have a calculus or 
trigonometry prerequisite, a common 
requirement to pursue a computer sci-
ence education that he says filters out 
a lot of potential students who would 
have otherwise learned a valuable skill.

“If you’ve taken calculus and you’ve 

taken programming, it will be very clear 
to you, very rapidly, that programming 
has nothing to do with calculus,” Sever-
ance explained. The computer science 
programs at the University have these 
requirements, he argued, as a harsh fil-
tering mechanism.

Students in “Python for Everybody,” 

by contrast, can stop taking a course, 
leave it alone for a while, and come back 
with their previous progress saved. The 
rapid pace of semester-based educa-
tion in college teaches students how to 
learn quickly and efficiently, though, in 
Severance’s experience, the best learn-
ing takes place in a nonlinear fashion 
across long stretches of time. In his 
view, this is a more forgiving method 
of learning and actually ends up mak-
ing knowledge stick a little better than 
if one were learning the same material 
while cramming for an exam or burn-
ing through a coding project within the 
span of a few days or less.

Love everlasting: the relationships 
that color my identity

W

hen I left home for col-
lege, my Bubbie — the Yid-
dish term for grandmother 

— gifted me with a thin red bracelet 
to protect me from the harm of the 
evil eye. The tradition is rooted in the 
spiritual Jewish practice called Kab-
balah, though the reasoning behind it 
is widely debated.

Some believe that a single woman 

should wear the red string around her 
wrist until it falls off naturally, indi-
cating that she will soon be married. 
Others suggest that the red symbol-
izes fertility or protection against the 
bloodshed of war. All my Bubbie told 
me was that her mother had done the 
same for her and that the bracelet 
would be a talisman of good luck as I 
entered this next stage of my life.

My family is Jewish, but we’re not 

that Jewish. We belong to a reform 
congregation, and at least for me, my 
Jewish identity is more about heritage 
than religion. I wasn’t surprised that 
my Bubbie chose to evoke this Jew-
ish tradition when I was preparing to 
leave home; just a few years earlier I 
received a slew of Jewish jewelry for 
my bat mitzvah celebration. But I had 
my suspicions that Bubbie’s gift had 
more to do with the color than the su-
perstition.

My Bubbie has always been a bright 

red woman. She regards ladybugs as 
a symbol of hope and taught me from 
a young age that if some accessory or 
article of clothing is red and sparkly, 
we have to buy it. This affinity for red 
tracks with Bubbie’s overall person-
ality: She is a formidable presence 
with a compassionate soul, loud and 
loyal with a social circle that extends 
across the world. That being said, 
Bubbie’s love for red is certainly di-
rected, at least in part, by her super-
stitious nature.

Bubbie will be the first one to knock 

on wood if someone jinxes them-
selves. Instead of saying “bless you,” 
she will proclaim that your sneeze 
was an omen of truth, confirming the 
last thing you said in conversation. 
When I talked to her for this story, 
Bubbie shared with me a number of 
other superstitions that her family 

and friends adhered to over the years 
— if your nose itches, you’re about 
to kiss a fool. If you drop something, 
someone is talking about you. “Hope 
it’s good,” her mother would say in 
reply.

Now, I can’t confirm the empirical 

basis of these superstitions. I can’t 
even tell you that I really believe 
they’re true. What I can tell you is 
that every time someone jinxes them-
selves in conversation, a little piece of 
my Bubbie appears in the back of my 
mind and possesses me to knock on 
the nearest wood. If there’s no wood 
around, I’ll knock on my head. Des-
perate times call for desperate mea-
sures.

Earlier this year, I bought my first 

car: a firetruck-red Fiat 500. Did I 
choose the color because of Bubbie? 
Not consciously. Did I think about 
Bubbie as I was making the purchase? 
Of course. I had to call her the minute 
I drove off the lot and relay the good 
news. I’ve spent so much time with 
my Bubbie over the course of my life 
that I’ve borrowed these little pieces 
of her identity and woven them into 
mine. It’s a blessing to be reminded of 
her at every possible opportunity, and 
the frequency with which it occurs is 
a testament to the strength and value 
of our relationship.

I

’ve been a perfectionist since I 
was just a little kid, especially 
when it came to school — a qual-

ity which I likely learned from my 
genius mother. However, this perfec-
tionism did not always serve me well.

For example, one day my fourth-

grade class was informed that we 
would be quizzed on the 50 states and 
their respective capitals. I’ve never 
been very good at geography, so I was 
frustrated when I couldn’t seem to 
commit the elusive pairings to mem-
ory. Time was ticking, so I needed to 
get out the big guns — I had to ask my 
parents for help.

To this day, I maintain that this was 

a written test, so there was no need 
for me to know the pronunciation of 
each city. However, my nine-year-old 
self was positively certain that Tope-

kah, Kan., was pronounced “toe-peck-
ah” (while it’s actually pronounced 
“toe-pee-kah”). After arguing with 
my father for what felt like forever, 
he finally Googled it. I was devastat-
ed. I stormed off in true nine-year-old 
fashion and didn’t even finish study-
ing for the quiz.

Now, whenever my parents and I 

quibble over some unimportant, in-
disputable fact, we cry out “toe-peck-
ah” as a shorthand of saying, “I know 
I’m right, and I’ll prove it.” Some-
times I call “toe-peck-ah” on myself 
when I find that I’m digging my heels 
in too deep on something rather irrel-
evant. It’s a reminder of that lesson 
I learned from my parents over a de-
cade ago: just calm down and Google 
it.

Perhaps the only reason I needed to 

learn this laissez-faire attitude from 
my parents is that they also taught me 
to be logical, precise and firm. Those 
traits again derive from my mother’s 
side of the family.

Her father, my Grandpa, is always 

pointing out grammatical errors. He 
hates when people swap the noun 
“invitation” out for the verb “invite” 
and insists that everyone around him 
understands that you stand behind 
a lectern but upon a podium. One 
Thanksgiving, that entire side of the 
family had a debate over dinner re-
garding whether or not a girl’s hair 
must be braided for her to technically 
be wearing “pig-tails.” Eventually, we 
brought out the dictionary, and yes, 
the braids are a linguistic prerequi-
site.

Thinking through all of these expe-

riences, it becomes increasingly clear 
that almost all of my niche interests 
and habits can be traced back to the 
interests and habits of the people 
I love. It’s nice to know that I carry 
those pieces of them with me wher-
ever I go and that they crop up when 
I least expect it.

***
T

here are also the habits I 
picked up from all the people 
who are no longer in my life — 

that advice I got from my camp coun-
selors in 2013, that phrase my friend 

group could not stop saying our se-
nior year of high school, that sweater 
I bought because it fit with my fresh-
man year roommate’s aesthetic. Each 
and every part of me was inspired by 
the world I choose to live in, even if 
only for a moment.

Maybe it’s because I’m a Gemini, 

or maybe it’s just because I’m human, 
but I am constantly taking inspiration 
from the people around me. With ev-
ery new adaptation, I am constructing 
my own personal culture. After two 
decades of curation, it has become a 
beautiful amalgamation of all my fa-
vorite experiences to date.

The general concept of culture ex-

ists on a gradient, meaning that there 
will be overlapping cultures within 
a town, a region, a country, etc. Just 
as how large communities develop a 
culture over time, our little worlds 
will effectively develop a culture of 
their own. We pull from and adapt to 
what’s around us, forging a new and 
unique identity as a mosaic of all our 
experiences.

Lots of things in life follow this 

template. Internet trends ebb and 
flow, emulating and influencing larg-
er cultural shifts. Even within a sin-
gle classroom, a culture can develop 
over the course of the semester which 
leads to the development of certain 
tendencies and inside jokes, distinc-
tive to that group of 20 to 30 people 
who knew each other for just six 
short months. Each insular culture in 
which an individual participates has 
the propensity to stick with them for 
their whole lifetime.

For me, that manifests through my 

participation in many overlapping 
cultures: that of my hometown, my 
workplace, The Daily, my house. Each 
of those environments offers unique 
opportunities for identity-shaping 
which I take in stride each and every 
day.

It’s comforting to know that all my 

past relationships live on as a sliver of 
who I am. Even ephemeral experienc-
es are commemorated. Even seem-
ingly insignificant experiences create 
their own meaning. And when com-
bined together, they all create me.

I 

brainstorm 
new 
topics 

for Michigan Daily articles, 
like this one, from my bed 

in the apartment I moved into 
when the freshmen residence 
halls closed. I rest my computer 
on my lap, blank document open 
and waiting, and I lean back into 
the silence. Across from my bed 
is a window, and through it, as 
I write or ponder, I see the yel-
low house next door. On clear 
evenings like tonight, the sunset 
compliments the friendly yel-
low house and the pink quilt on 
my bed. The light casts a warm 
hue over my room and brings the 
tapestry of the sky and twinkly 
lights on the wall next to me to 
life. It’s a zen, quiet, picturesque 
moment, arguably my favorite of 
the week. 

I’ve had the privilege of this 

simple yet mesmerizing view 
for three months now. And for 
three months, while I sit looking 
at the yellow house and my quilt 
in the sun’s rays, I continuously 
have the same thought: What 
would my younger self, perhaps 
my year-ago self, think if she saw 
me here? What would she make 
of the yellow house? Of my bed-
room? The fact that I’m clearly 
not in a residence hall? Without 
explanation, she’d be shocked 
and confused, to say the least.

I think it’s a crazy phenom-

enon — that I, a year ago today, 
would have never conceived of 
this image, my life and my cir-
cumstances right now. A phe-
nomenon not unlike Alice in 
Wonderland falling down the 
rabbit hole: one moment she was 
walking, the next moment she 
was in an unrecognizable, al-
ternate reality with all sense of 
normality flipped on its head. I 
never imagined that I’d be living 
in an apartment in Ann Arbor, 
making my own meals, attending 
online classes or wearing a mask 
every time I was in public.

We have the pandemic to 

thank for shaking things up; for 
throwing us down rabbit holes 
and making almost all of our 
present realities completely dif-
ferent from what our year-ago 
selves would have predicted 
them to be. And I know that CO-
VID-19 moving plans around and 
making lives harder is not a nov-
el concept. But I think there is 
something deeper that we need 
to dig out and find value in be-
fore we completely move on.

This pandemic has brought 

suffering, loneliness, deaths of 
loved ones — for my family, my 
dad’s father — and cancella-
tions of opportunities that were 
heartbreaking. I’m thrilled to 
leave such a devastating period 
behind. But, as the weather gets 
warmer, as vaccines become 
widely accessible and as the 
news channels begin to spend air 
time on other issues, I can feel 
the pandemic era fleeting. And 
though this sounds strange or 
even twisted, I do feel a sense of 
nostalgia.

On the day-to-day level, the 

pandemic turned my life from 
fairly predictable to wildly ab-
normal, and I found a little thrill 
in that. At the very beginning, I 
thought I’d have two weeks of 
senior spring break instead of 
one. Naive to what was com-
ing, I was overjoyed with the 
school’s calendar change and the 
prospect of having extra time 
off — the world, or at least the 
extended spring break, was my 
oyster. I then spent months on 
end at home, but upon my arrival 
at college, I spent no more than 
three weeks in a single location. 
I moved quickly from my new 
residence hall room; to quaran-
tine with people I barely knew; 
to a room alone, sick with chest 
pains, fever and brain fog. Now 
here I am on this pink quilt in an 
apartment. 

It’s felt like the Adventures 

of Me in Wonderland. The un-
known. The unpredictable. The 
discomfort. The unexpected en-
counters. The possibility. There 
were new opportunities and 
experiences that wouldn’t have 
been on the menu had business-
per-usual been at play. I also rec-
ognize that I was lucky enough 
to be in a position with more 
privileged circumstances to view 
uncertainty in this way. I was 
forced to bounce around, but as 
a result, I tried more things and 
experienced many more versions 
of life and of myself. Instead of 
having one roommate through-
out my first semester, I experi-
enced four. I met an adult side of 
me that hadn’t previously been 
so required. I also uncovered a 
relaxed version of myself, con-
tent and not so bothered by my 
new nomadic lifestyle. 

Not only was this exciting, 

but to me, the idea of normal 
routines being broken, that the 
day-to-day humdrum of life was 
completely disrupted, felt a bit 
liberating. Expectations were on 
hold. I had no impressive job or 
fancy internship over the sum-
mer, and relaxed in the dog days 
knowing barely anyone else did 
either. Even once I got to school 
in August, there was no guar-
antee that I’d be staying due to 
positive tests or campus rules. 
Again, while terrifying, this lack 
of predictability was also free-
ing, as I wasn’t beholden to any-
one or any permanent circum-
stances. Everything was subject 
to change and predominantly out 
of my control. I’m a high-strung 
person, I’m intent on making 
the right decisions and I have a 
proclivity for perfectionism that 
probably needs curbing. While a 
lot of my energy usually goes to-
wards manning the chessboard 
that’s my life, moving pieces and 
planning ahead, I had to step 

down, surrender and let COV-
ID-19 play my game. 

I’ve never experienced so 

many redirects and pivots in my 
plans in such a short amount of 
time. Between the amount of CO-
VID-19 scares and tests I had to 
take and the frequency at which 
my circumstances were con-
stantly changing, I was essen-
tially forced to adopt the “do one 
thing every day that scares you” 
regime. I was not complacent 
with my expectations of any cer-
tain schedule or way of life. I was 
here, I was there, the future was 
unclear and I was forced to ride 
the wave of the present. 
T

oday, I’m on a job and 
internship search for my 
summer, weighing op-

tions and choices, sending emails 
and scheduling calls, deciding 
where I’ll find the best experi-
ence. I know whatever I choose 
and wherever I’ll go, that’s where 
I’ll be planted and that’s the 
schedule that I’ll follow. I notice 
that “no expectation” mentality, 
previously mandated by my pan-
demic circumstances, running 
away.

As society goes back to nor-

mal, I wonder if we’ll all return to 
the scheduled and routine way of 
life. Never before has my genera-
tion, at least, experienced such 
an elongated shattering of regu-
lar life, and it’s unclear whether 
the effects will be everlasting. 
Will we go back to creating plans 
and going through the motions 
of what and where society says 
we’re supposed to be? After some 
time, will I regress to operating 
on a one-track mind, unable to 
see non-obvious opportunities 
or life-course excursions? Per-
haps I’ll see them, but expecta-
tions will stop me from pursuing 
them. I fear that I’ll never again 
observe a scene in my life and 
wonder what the hell my year-
ago self would make of it.

And so, while I’m eager to nev-

er hear the word “corona” again, 
I do have to think about how I 
can extract what was good and 
instructive from the rubble and 
keep it in my pocket moving for-
ward. What I can gather is that 
there’s something to be said for 
spontaneity. For operating under 
lower expectations. I don’t need 
to drop out of college or move to 
Switzerland as soon as I gradu-
ate. But I do think I have to make 
a conscious effort to remind my-
self to “shake things up.” It’s on 
me to remember not to worry so 
much about the shoulds or dead-
lines or expected courses of ac-
tion because, hopefully, a global 
pandemic will never again make 
that decision for me. 

As I sit here, watching the sun-

set over the yellow house, I think 
I’ve come up with a good rule of 
thumb: to sometimes opt for the 
choice that perhaps my year-ago 
self wouldn’t have been able to 
envision. To choose to tumble 
down the rabbit hole. After all, 
the sun still sets and the sun still 
rises. From wherever I’ve been 
quarantined, from wherever I’ve 
logged on to Zoom, from what-
ever car rides I was taking, job I 
was doing, puzzle I was piecing, 
the sun still did her thing above 
me. No matter how jumbled my 
own schedule was, the sun still 
followed hers in the sky. Always 
did, always will. I think knowing 
this is security enough to make 
spontaneous decisions or veer 
away from the humdrum here 
and there. 

Tonight, the sun sets on the 

yellow house, pink quilt and my 
last Daily piece of the year. It 
sets on winter, on the near-end 
of the pandemic and near-end 
of expectations obligatorily be-
ing set at the wayside. I wonder 
where I’ll be a year from now 
when it rises. I hope that I’m 
surprised.

accines. The epitome of 
short-term 
pain, 
long-

term gain. A scientific 

achievement and feat of human 
accomplishment that can be received 
in a grocery store pharmacy. A quick 
pinch in the arm gives people more 
hope than they’ve felt in a year. The 
vaccine is nothing short of a miracle 
and likely what will usher us out 
of the current pandemic. While it 
seems like campus is abuzz about 
the vaccine, especially with Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer’s, 
D-Mich., 

statement about vaccine availability 
for all adults aged 16 and older on 
April 5, I am deeply concerned by a 
pattern of behavior that has emerged: 
lying about one’s situation expressly 
for the purpose of getting a vaccine.

I’ve heard a number of strategies 

or ways to “game the system” being 
passed around among students 
looking to jump in line. Things like 
claiming a non-visible disability or 
illness, claiming employment in the 
childcare or healthcare industries 
while not working in either field 
or crossing state lines and faking 
residency. Driving to Ohio, while 
claiming to be working in childcare 
in the state, may seem like a harmless 
strategy 
for 
getting 
vaccinated 

quicker when in reality it is wrong, 
dangerous and immoral. 

From a purely ethical standpoint, 

lying for personal gain is wrong. 
From a health perspective, taking a 

vaccine out of the hands of someone 
within a category that needs it more 
is detrimental to the long-term public 
health initiative of vaccination. From 
a community standpoint, taking a 
vaccine appointment from someone 
who is at greater risk and therefore in 
greater need is shameful.

The tiered system for receiving 

vaccines was designed in many ways 
to prioritize the needs of front-line 
workers, people with disabilities 
and chronic illnesses, areas with 
less robust hospital systems and 
healthcare and childcare workers. 
The plans were designed to limit 
the spread of COVID-19, especially 
amongst 
our 
most 
vulnerable 

populations and those working with 
them, at the forefront. With demand 
significantly higher than supply at 
this point in the pandemic, this tiered 
system is a necessary facet of vaccine 
distribution to ensure the best possible 
public health outcome.

While the tiered system certainly 

has its flaws in verification, that 
does not give people permission 
to take advantage of those that 
need the system to get vaccinated 
due to their employment or health 
situation. Although locations may 
not check identities, employment 
records, disability statuses, places 
of residence or other features that 
would demonstrate valid reasons for 
vaccination at this point, that does not 
grant permission to abuse the system.

This behavior is not to be confused 

with perfectly legitimate means of 
obtaining a vaccine early. No-waste 
lists are a great way to get a vaccine 
early without stealing an appointment 
from someone who needs it more. 
No-waste lists allow hospitals or 
vaccination clinics to reach out when 
there are leftover vaccines that would 
go to waste or expire if they aren’t used. 

Volunteering at vaccine clinics is 

also a noble and encouraged way to get 
a vaccine earlier. Helping organize or 
staff a vaccine clinic allows the gears 
of public health to turn and usually 
includes the perk of receiving a vaccine 
in exchange for one’s service. The 
additional risk of working at a clinic — 
potentially exposing oneself to many 
people — is grounds for receiving a 
vaccination if one is available.

I want to make it clear that I 

recognize the fear of COVID-19 is 
incredibly real, almost paralyzing 
for many of us. Many of us, myself 
included, have directly lost family 
members, friends, teachers, classmates 
or colleagues to the virus or its 
accompanying medical complications. 
However, this fear cannot be an 
excuse for leaving integrity behind.

“

All this damn activism is just 
performative!” 
This of course, is not true. 

However, in my irritation over this 
week’s shameless recycling of the 
activism seen on social media during 
previous movements, I yelled this 
statement at my boyfriend followed 
by several profanities. 

This week, my social media feed, 

like many others, has been filled 
with colorful slideshows advocating 
for awareness of anti-Asian racism. 
With the recent rise of this issue 
and the subsequent mass shooting 
in Atlanta, Ga., came the inevitable 
rise of Instagram infographics. Posts 
about local Asian-owned businesses 
and links to GoFundMe pages began 
circulating, and it soon became clear 
that this was largely a repurposing of 
this summer’s calls to action.

Infographic culture arose over the 

summer as a form of activism that 
didn’t require leaving the house 
during a pandemic. Twitter 
threads with GoFundMe links 
to the families of victims and 
Black Lives Matter carrds 
popped up on every app 
and honestly, it was a good 
thing. Maybe it was slightly 
performative, but it was nice to 
see a focus on self-education. 
Black history and systemic 
oppression 
were 
common 

themes of my social media feed. 
However, social media over the 
past few weeks has contained 
suspiciously similar rhetoric.

The problem with recycling 

these themes is, of course, that 
not all racism is the same. Anti-
Asian racism, while horrible 
and particularly acute at this moment, 
is born in xenophobia. Anti-Black 
racism, on the other hand, is more 
institutionalized and comes from an 
insidious 400-year history of slavery 
and oppression in the United States. 
Without addressing the difference, it 
is impossible to fix either issue or to 
have a meaningful discourse about 
them. And these Instagram posts, 
well-intentioned as they may be, are 
proving to be less than useful in truly 
breaking down these distinctions. 

I appreciate Instagram activism 

— education is a valuable tool for 
self-growth, and these slideshows 
distill difficult information in an 
easily digestible format, making it 
easy to be passed along. However, 
infographic 
culture 
attempts 

reached beyond its limits. 

Most social issues are difficult to 

understand for a reason: They are 
complex, nuanced and cannot be 
understood in 10 slides or fewer. Anti-
Asian racism is one such issue. 

For years, Asian people have 

been held up next to Black and 
Hispanic people as the “model 
minority” 
in 
America. 
This 

stereotype provides more than 
just a wedge to drive minorities 
seeking racial justice apart — it’s 
also an opportunity for people 
to claim that Asian people are 
privileged, and therefore, that 
anti-Asian racism doesn’t exist 
in the United States. After all, if 
so many Asian-American people 
attend top universities and have 
successful careers where they are 
paid as much or even more than 
their white counterparts, how bad 
can racism really be?

This simple-minded rhetoric fails 

to acknowledge the struggles of many 
Asian people in America, particularly 
immigrant workers such as those 
that were murdered in Atlanta 
last week. Anti-Asian sentiments 
that were exacerbated during the 
COVID-19 pandemic and the ones 
held by the Atlanta shooter stem from 
xenophobia and a fear of outsiders. 
Fears that Asian immigrants are 
going to steal American jobs are as 
old as Asian-American history itself. 
In addition, media tropes that hyper-
sexualize Asian women, paint Asian 
men as feminine or weak and force 
Asian-American actors to put on 
heavy, fake accents further influence 
American perception of Asian people, 
particularly Asian immigrants. 

This is not to imply that anti-Asian 

racism is somehow easier to solve or 
less ingrained in American culture 
than anti-Black racism, but they are 
different. While both require a severe 
examination of our own implicit 
biases and of society’s rhetoric, 
it is important to remember that 
an Instagram infographic cannot 
do that for us. They can be useful 
tools for provoking the internal 
dialogue necessary to conduct such 
an evaluation, but these graphics 
alone do not lead to enough of the 
conversations required around the 
proverbial dinner tables. In fact, 
many lead people the opposite way, 
allowing us to memorize statistics 
and harden pre-existing beliefs 
without critically thinking about the 
issues or our role in them. 

It is easy to show a performative 

amount of allyship when it takes 
three clicks to repost an infographic 

onto your Instagram story. 
This kind of “infographic 
activism” places the problem 
and its blame squarely onto 
one’s followers, as opposed to 
being a tool for critical analysis 
of one’s own prejudices. 

I can’t pretend I have 

never engaged in this easy, 
mindless form of activism. 
It’s simple, comfortable and 
socially acceptable. It is much 
more difficult to actively seek 
out 
alternative 
resources, 

examine your own biases and 
understand the complexities of 
the situation. Regardless, just 
like anti-Black racism, anti-
Asian sentiment cannot be 
easily fixed through protests, 

donations or shopping at Asian-owned 
businesses — though these are all good 
ways to show solidarity with the Asian 
community. Anti-Asian racism is 
often subtle and can slip through the 
cracks in society’s perception of what 
is considered “racist.” 

Social media’s simple breakdown 

of complex social issues in ten slides 
or less glosses over the ways in 
which people can help in the real 
world. Allyship is difficult work. It 
takes constant revision, apologies 
and compassion. Nuance is a key 
component in being a good ally, and 
honestly, Instagram infographics just 
aren’t cutting it anymore.

W

e acknowledge that the University 
of Michigan sits on the ancestral, 
traditional 
and 
contemporary 

lands of the Anishinaabeg — the Three Fires 
Confederacy of Ojibwe, Odawa and Potawatomi 
peoples. By offering this acknowledgment, we 
want to affirm Indigenous sovereignty and 
advocate for the sovereignty of Michigan’s 12 
federally-recognized Indian nations, for historic 
Indigenous communities in Michigan, for 
Indigenous individuals and communities who 
continue to live among us and for those who 
were forcibly removed from their Homelands. 
Honoring Indigenous communities, both past 
and present, as well as future generations, we 
would like to speak about the issue of anti-Asian 
racism and violence in the United States. 

Dear University of Michigan leadership, 
We, as Asians, Asian Americans and allies 

in the School of Information doctoral student 
community, are deeply saddened and enraged by 
the brutal shootings in Atlanta on March 16. Six 
victims were women of Asian descent (according 
to an announcement from Stop AAPI Hate, some 
families of the victims have asked for their names 
not to be shared). An interview with a surviving 
witness in a widely read Korean media outlet 
revealed that the suspect vowed to “kill all Asians 
_____” right before the shooting. Yet, in the wake 
of the Atlanta shootings, the Office of Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion released a statement that 
did not directly regard the shooting as racially 
motivated, instead saying “the suspect has stated 
that race was not a motivating factor in their 
acts.” 

The Office of the President’s statement 

emphasizes the University’s long-held ties with 
many students and colleagues of Asian descent, 
saying, “As a university community that 
welcomed our first Chinese students almost 
130 years ago, we cherish the intellectual and 
social contributions of our students, faculty and 
staff of Asian descent.” However, highlighting 
how the University benefits from or contributes 
to Asian and Asian American communities 
does not directly address the root cause of anti-
Asian racism: white supremacy. We expect 
the leadership to publicly denounce white 
supremacy — the key ideology that perpetuates 
racial injustice.

The same statement from the leadership 

also encouraged faculty, staff and students 
to seek out resources they have provided. 
However, a list of resources will not suffice for 
understanding the deep anti-Asian sentiments 
that have plagued the United States for 
centuries and surged over the past few years. 

While reminding Asians and Asian Americans 
of resources to address anti-Asian racism is a 
step forward, it can also be read as delegating 
the responsibility to communities of Asian 
descent to deal with systematic inequalities and 
anti-Asian racism.

More than 12% of students (which doesn’t 

include non-resident students) at the University 
of Michigan are from Asian countries or are 
Asian descendants. Despite this fact, we note 
that leadership and faculty members in several 
schools and departments have been late to 
acknowledge that the surge in anti-Asian hate 
crimes, including but not limited to the Atlanta 
shooting, is not only due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. These acts are also deeply related 
to how Asians and Asian Americans have 
been historically subjected to exclusionary 
immigration, labor policies and episodic 
violence for more than a century.

This includes a litany of U.S. foreign policy 

episodes against Asian countries and against 
communities of Asian descent within the 
United States. In the People v. Hall case in 1854, 
the Supreme Court of California reversed the 
murder conviction of George W. Hall against 
Chinese immigrant Ling Sing because three 
prosecution witnesses were Chinese. This case 
allowed white Americans to avoid punishment 
for anti-Asian violence. The Page Act of 1875, 
thereafter, was the first restrictive immigration 
law in the U.S., which banned Chinese women 
from entering the U.S. by classifying them all as 
sex workers and “immoral.” 

This was followed by the creation of the 

Asiatic Barred Zone through the Immigration 
Act of 1917, which aimed to limit immigrants from 
Asian countries. Not long after, the government 
of the United States built internment camps to 
enclose communities of Japanese Americans 
who they believed were potentially spying 
against the nation-state during World War II, 
while the U.S. fought against Japan in Southeast 
Asia. Southeast Asian migrants continued to 
experience border violence after U.S. occupation 
in the Philippines, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam 
since the late 19th century. 

The calls to wage “war on terror” in Asia, the 

Middle East and Africa have led to the ongoing 
policing and surveillance of Brown populations 
from Central and South Asia, especially after 
9/11. Islamophobia has dire consequences on 
other religious communities in the United 
States: A neo-Nazi killed six Sikh people during a 
Sunday service at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin 
in Oak Creek, Wis., in 2012, driven by what the 
Sikh community believed was anti-Muslim hate. 

The University of Michigan itself is 

complicit in racism and colonialism against 
Asia and Asians. James Burrill Angell, the 
University’s longest-serving president, served 
as U.S. Minister to China from 1880 to 1881 and 
was the primary American negotiator of the 
Angell Treaty of 1880. The treaty permitted 
restrictions on Chinese immigration and laid 
the foundation for the Chinese Exclusion Act 
in 1882. The University of Michigan also hosts 
a large collection of cultural artifacts from U.S. 
colonies and marginalized groups. 

For instance, the U.S. has a long colonial 

history in the Philippines, including the 
occupation of the Philippines (1898-1946), 
the Philippine-American War (1899-1902) 
and the operation of U.S. bases in the islands 
(1899-1992). The opportunity to study and 
explore a newly acquired territory, combined 
with the paternalistic mission to civilize 
and democratize the islands and its peoples, 
prompted U-M faculty, students and alumni 
to go to the Philippines to teach, conduct field 
research, establish business ventures and 
occupy prominent colonial administrative 
posts. This makes the University one of the 
largest collectors of Philippine items in North 
America.

Anti-Asian racism, then, builds and extends 

from the key forms of racism in the United 
States: chattel slavery and anti-Black violence, 
settler colonialism and U.S. imperialism. 
Because of the specific historical experiences 
of Asians and Asian Americans and the recent 
surge in anti-Asian racism such as calling 
COVID-19 “China virus,” we find it crucial to 
develop our own voice in matters of anti-Asian 
racism. In academia, we are typically perceived 
as receiving an honorary white status, and 
American media and political discourse 
have portrayed Asians and Asian Americans 
as “model minorities.” Nonetheless, we are 
subjected to white supremacy and our voices 
are often silenced, neglected or misconstrued.

The University portrays itself as a safe haven 

for students of color. But being a student does 
not protect us from the 
risk and anxiety of 

being insulted, accused, harassed or assaulted 
in daily life as we pursue our educational goals. 
Even within universities, we have witnessed 
repeated incidents of sexual harassment, abuse, 
racial aggression and discrimination not being 
fully addressed, such as allegations of sexual 
misconduct by professors Jason Mars and Peter 
Chen, and racist fliers on campus targeting 
multiple communities of color. Simply saying 
that the University of Michigan has supported 

students through education is not enough to 
address anti-Asian racism.

Importantly, many of the people who have 

been harmed in anti-Asian hate crimes are 
sexual and gender minorities (e.g. women, 
genderqueer, femme-presenting people, non-
binary, transgender, bisexual, lesbian). The 
research from the Stop AAPI Hate Reporting 
Center revealed that 68% of anti-Asian hate 
crimes targeted Asian women. We ask that 
the U-M leadership, faculty members and staff 
recognize that this is a crime at the intersection 
of anti-Asian racism, heteropatriarchy and 
misogynistic violence. Asian sexual and gender 
minorities experience various forms of violence, 
ranging from microaggressions such as name-
calling to forced physical and sexual abuse — 
knowing and recognizing this is fundamental in 
showing solidarity to students of Asian descent. 

We are inspired by the ongoing efforts 

developed by Black, Indigenous and persons 
of color activist groups in and outside of the 
University because we believe that solidarity 
relies on building ties and organizing for the 
voices of other communities of color. The core 
issue here is white supremacy. We continue to 
learn from these groups and speak out against 
these deadly issues alongside them.

We would like to end with some tangible 

action items for U-M leadership, faculty and 
staff. 

* Offer to listen when checking in with Asian 

and Asian American students instead of waiting 
for them to reach out if you haven’t done so yet. 
We have heard from students around us about 
the lack of faculty members’ attention about 
anti-Asian hate crimes, which indicates the 
lack of understanding about racism that Asians 
and Asian Americans experience or perhaps, 
more importantly, their lack of effort to educate 
themselves about it. When you check in with 
Asian and Asian American students, don’t use 
vague language like “mass shooting” or “bad 
things happened.” Use precise words such as 
“anti-Asian” or “racism” to name the issue. The 
Atlanta shooting is an issue committed against 
some of the most vulnerable populations in the 
U.S. that intersect across class, race, gender, 
sexuality and ability. The complexity of the 
issue is not a sufficient excuse to resist naming 
the incident as such.

* There are a lot of white-Asian, supervisor-

supervisee relationships due to the high 
percentage of white academics. If you are a 
white supervisor, recognize that Asian and 
Asian American students have been frequently 
subjected 
to 
microaggressions 
in 
such 

relationships. Create a culture against it.

* Educate yourself about anti-Asian racism 

and encourage other non-Asian people to do 
so. Do not ask Asians and Asian Americans 
you know to teach you about anti-Asian racism 
— especially not during these moments when 
we’re busy healing ourselves. Some pointers we 
suggest are: Violence Against Asian-Americans 
Isn’t New, but It Is Growing | The Amber 
Ruffin Show; Coping with & Contextualizing 
Anti-Asian Racism & Pandemics; Anti-Asian 
Violence Resources; Asian American Feminism 
Resources; Excluding Asians as a minority 
group ignores decades of hardship. 

* Learn to pronounce our names correctly 

and distinguish our faces. Research has shown 
that the mispronouncing of names in schools can 
negatively impact students’ self-perceptions and 
worldviews and can even lead students to shy 
away from their own cultures or families.

* Please consider donating to organizations 

that are committed to fighting against anti-
Asian racism or directly donating to the people 
harmed by the hate crimes: Asian Americans 
Advancing Justice-Atlanta is a nonprofit legal 
advocacy organization dedicated to protecting 
the civil rights of Asian Americans, Native 
Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (AANHPI) in 
Georgia and the Southeast.; Asian American 
Advocacy Fund is a grassroots organization 
dedicated to building a progressive Asian 
American base in Georgia.; Red Canary Song 
is a grassroots collective of Asian and migrant 
sex workers.; Jean Yang, a former professor 
at Carnegie Mellon University, created a 
document with various GoFundMe campaigns 
aiming to cover medical expenses and recovery 
after racist attacks on Asian-Americans and 
Asian-owned businesses.

* Do not impose your views on what 

immigrants need to know or how to behave 
— for example, stop telling Asian students to 
“practice English” outside of work by giving 
up their primary language; stop telling Asian 
students to “fit in” or “find an English name.” 
Immigrants bring their own perspective that 
contributes and actively adds to U.S. culture, 
which should be acknowledged and celebrated.

T

his past week, there was a little 
drama in the race for New Mexico’s 
1st Congressional District. Sheridan 

Lund, the precinct chair of the Democratic 
Party of Bernalillo County and candidate for 
the congressional seat, tweeted a now-deleted 
attack on one of the candidates. The charge 
being leveled was that Victor Reyes, a former 
top aide to New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan 
Grisham and one of the candidates for the 
congressional seat, was only pretending to be 
a person of color. Reyes is a second-generation 
Mexican-American. Many of the other 
candidates running for Congress in this district 
released statements condemning the attack. 
What interested me is that at the time that the 
offending tweet was deleted, it only had about 
two likes and two negative quote tweets. 

My recent tweet about Fortnite skins got 

more likes than these poorly thought-out 
musings on colorism. By responding to Lund’s 
message, every candidate in the race was able 
to accrue some political capital and establish 
themselves as the candidate of racial justice. But 
they shouldn’t have responded. 

This falls in with a trend with which I’ve 

taken issue recently: treating certain social 
media posts as much more influential than 
they actually are. Media literacy is important 
and constantly evolving. Today I am offering an 
additional digital rule of thumb: Don’t engage 
with posts that don’t have traction (likes, 
shares, etc.). If a post doesn’t have engagement, 
that is the internet’s way of telling you that no 
one really found the post to be compelling, so 
you won’t actually be swaying any opinions by 
condemning it. Actors on the digital landscape, 
no matter how large or small the audience, 
have a responsibility to only respond to a piece 
of media they disagree with if it has an actual 
audience. Otherwise, they aren’t countering the 
sway of the original idea. 

On the contrary, they are amplifying it 

to their audience who wouldn’t have been 
exposed to it in the first place. Those who 
devote themselves to criticizing irrelevant posts 
that gained no traction on the 
merits of the 

idea presented are distorting the narrative — 
and doing a disservice to themselves and their 
audience in the process. 

Highlighting the fringe is how many figures 

of the online political influencer class make 
their livings. Ben Shapiro, probably the most 
influential conservative online pundit, recently 
released a YouTube video entitled “Leftists 
OUTRAGED Over Bill Burr Jokes at 2021 
Grammys.” The premise of the video is that 

there are currently swathes of rabid Democrats 
who want to take your comedy away from you, 
a premise engineered to infuriate his audience. 
This simply wasn’t true. 

If you looked on Twitter, where the outrage 

was allegedly coming from, a couple of negative 
posts had gained a few hundred likes. But it 
seemed for every negative tweet about Bill 
Burr with five or ten likes, there were scores 
of people absolutely indignant that people 
could be so sensitive, all producing the same 
ten offending Tweets as evidence for a larger 
cultural sickness. 

So what should people respond to on the 

internet? I would offer a couple of criteria for 
a post to be considered worthy of a response. 
First, how much traction did this idea actually 
get? If Joe Schmoe posts on Facebook that we 
should put the Social Security Trust Fund into 
Bitcoin, and the post receives two likes and 
one “Interesting!” comment from his second-
grade teacher, I am confident that the national 
narrative would not benefit from a prominent 
account screenshotting it, posting to their 
thousands of followers, and doing the 21st 
century equivalent of eviscerating the person 
on a daytime talk show. 

However, if Joe Schmoe’s post somehow 

manages to gain traction, then it might be 
worth engaging. On the other hand, if Ezra 
Klein, a New York Times columnist, tweets that 
we should put the Social Security Trust Fund 
into Bitcoin, regardless of how much or how 
little engagement the post gets, this thought 
is relevant and merits a response. Overall, you 
should respond if the thinker is prominent or if 
the reach of their thought was large.

These criteria apply less and less the 

closer the person is to you. I still want 
to empower you to get into Facebook 
arguments with your cousins about what 
time of year is best for seeing geese, because 
that person actually has a huge audience 
relative to your life — you and everyone 
close to you are the intended audiences. In 
a lot of ways, the internet is not necessarily 
a public forum. It is the Diag. You aren’t 
there to speak about and listen to a specific 
topic, you are there to do your own thing. 
If someone is shouting at the top of their 
lungs from one of those benches in front 
of Hatcher Graduate Library, you and 
everyone else would probably walk right by 
them. But if you see a crowd of a thousand 
listening to some weirdo’s ideas about the 
Federal Reserve, you have much more of a 
desire to comment. 

On the internet, we perceive things to be 

much more oriented at us than we do in real 
life. The phenomenon I am talking about is 
based much more on remoteness. If Facebook 
arguments with relatives are hand-to-hand 
combat, I am preaching against snipers: 
rummaging through the internet for the sole 
purpose of becoming enraged, finding the 
worst articulation of the offending concept, and 
pulling the trigger.

Let’s circle back to the tweet that caused all 

my strife in the NM-1 congressional race. What 
should the candidates have done? I don’t want to 
sound too much like a kindergarten teacher, but 
ignoring it is often the best policy. Platforming 
the fringe is a poor decision. If an idea isn’t 
held by a significant number of people, it isn’t 
important enough to bring to the attention of 
your audience, or even worth your time. 

I know it’s almost all I write about these 

days, but this phenomenon contributes 
to political polarization. Picking the least 
articulate, least important post which was 
unable to gain any traction on the merits of its 
ideas, and magnifying it — responding to it as 
if it’s something greater — causes audiences to 
perceive society as a split between themselves 
and those who formulated the odd ideas in 
question. And that is rarely an accurate map 
of the populace. There is a genre of accounts 
that will find a post with not much traction, 
expressing the least developed version of an 
idea, and compile it with thousands of others 
with the goal of proving how much better X or 
Y ideology is than the other. 

Ignoring fringe posts won’t solve much. 

It won’t dismantle polarization, bigotry or 
online rudeness, but it will avoid unnecessarily 
elevating an idea no one listened to in the first 
place. It’s also a way to practice some self-
respect. Often the only way we can interpret 
social media is as a direct message to us, and 
one which needs a response. Thinking of the 
internet as the Diag instead of a conversation 
or a forum can help you escape this mindset. 
People aren’t talking to you, they’re preaching 
into the air. It isn’t your responsibility to 
counter every silly thing someone says from 
their digital soapbox, but if other people start 
engaging with the idea, then you have the right 
to add your own commentary about the original 
post. With these criteria for social media non-
confrontation, you can become a beacon of 
restraint in the digital age.

O

n a basic level, humans need 
four things to survive: food, 
water, shelter and air. Three of 

these have already been commodified, 
leaving only air untouched. Human 
beings take an average of 22,000 breaths 
per day. Whether someone is exercising, 
sick or breathing polluted air, breathing 
is something that isn’t noticed until it’s 
difficult to do. Between the COVID-19 
pandemic, the West Coast wildfires and 
an increase in global pollution, clean air is 
becoming more and more of a luxury. Air 
cannot become commercialized like food, 
shelter and water already have; this would 
put the lives of millions of people in danger. 

COVID-19 has taught us many things 

about the way our society functions, but 
one major takeaway is that even basic tasks 
like breathing can become disrupted by 
unexpected phenomena. As elementary, 
middle and high schools move to reopen, 
they have faced the question of how to 
fit hundreds of students into hot, poorly 
ventilated classrooms. 

At first glance, schools should be hotbeds 

for viral spread. Infections are 18.7 times 
more likely to occur indoors, where virus 
particles remain in the air for up to three 
hours. However, schools have invested 
heavily in high-efficiency particulate air 
filters that work to prevent molecules from 
being transported by air. While these are 
not perfect, they have done a solid job in 
classrooms that have invested properly in 
the air filtration systems. 

But what happens when a school district 

cannot afford the ventilation systems that 
satisfy Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention guidelines? A federal watchdog 
service found that 41% of grade schools 
needed to update or completely overhaul 
their air filtration systems prior to COVID-
19. These schools often faced tight budgets 
and had to opt for the cheapest filtration 
systems. New York City’s public schools 
have bought over 30,000 new air filtration 
systems since the pandemic started, but 
teachers, concerned they will not be enough 
to ensure students’ safety, crowdfunded 
an additional $159,000 to purchase more. 
Schools in poorer neighborhoods need to 
upgrade their current systems just to reach 
the pre-pandemic filtration level of those in 
schools in rich neighborhoods. 

Unfortunately, this problem extends 

beyond 
classrooms. 
Due 
to 
cheap 

construction materials and techniques, 
the air in our homes can be up to five 
times dirtier than outdoors. As people are 
spending more time indoors because of the 
pandemic, they are spending more time 
breathing dirty — albeit, COVID-19 free 
— air. Dozens of health issues have been 
linked to unclean indoor air, such as asthma, 
allergies, depression and sleep apnea. 

Yet, outdoor air can be just as dangerous. 

Data from the World Health Organization 
shows that nine in every 10 people globally 
breathe air that exceeds WHO standards 
for pollutant levels. That same data found 
that seven million people die every year 
from air pollution, and air pollution is 
responsible for roughly one out of every 
eight deaths worldwide. The United 
Nations estimates that air pollution costs all 
nations combined around $5 trillion every 
year in prevention and mitigation efforts. 
In the United States, the Clean Air Act 
has helped lower lead air pollution by 92% 
since 1980, but globally, half of all people are 
experiencing worsening air quality. 

Last fall, California, Oregon and 

Washington experienced unprecedented 
wildfires. The fires were not only 
unprecedented in their severity, but also in 
their effect on the nation’s air quality. As a 
result of the fires, one in seven Americans 
experienced dangerous levels of pollutants 
in their air. The fires impacted air quality 
in nearby areas such as Portland, Ore., 
which had the world’s worst air quality, 
but their impact was also felt across the 
world, including in Europe. As climate 
change increases the frequency of forest 
fires, they will only continue to harm 
global air quality. 

Urban centers generally have the 

worst air quality, and as more people 
continue to move to cities around the 
world, they give us a good place to start 
improving air quality. One basic step 
that cities can take is creating more 
green spaces. Whether by planting trees, 
creating roof gardens or expanding 
public parks, creating these green spaces 
reduces air pollution and provides 
residents with cleaner, cooler air, along 
with many other health benefits. 

Another major step that can be taken 

is transitioning toward electric buses and 
trains and encouraging biking and walking 
through safer trails and sidewalks. Motor 
vehicles in Philadelphia contribute to 
about 60% of the city’s total air pollution, 
demonstrating how switching to green 
transportation could significantly lower 
emissions.

Like all aspects of climate change, air 

quality issues harm vulnerable populations 
the 
most 
and 
compound 
existing 

inequities. Solutions must take this into 
account or risk worsening inequalities. 
Air quality isn’t about preserving the 
planet or environment for generations to 
come. Rather, it is about improving public 
health right now and averting preventable 
diseases, health problems and premature 
deaths.

Michigan’s sex-ed hurts students’ sexual health

accines. The epitome of short-
term pain, long-term gain. A 
scientific achievement and feat 

of human accomplishment that can be 
received in a grocery store pharmacy. 
A quick pinch in the arm gives people 
more hope than they’ve felt in a year. The 
vaccine is nothing short of a miracle and 
likely what will usher us out of the current 
pandemic. While it seems like campus 
is abuzz about the vaccine, especially 
with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s, D-Mich., 
statement about vaccine availability for 
all adults aged 16 and older on April 5, 
I am deeply concerned by a pattern of 
behavior that has emerged: lying about 
one’s situation expressly for the purpose 
of getting a vaccine.

Like all education in the United States, 

individual states set their own standards 
for sex education. Many states need to 
reform these standards. Only 39 states and 
Washington, D.C., require sex ed and/or 
HIV education, and it only gets worse from 
there. 

A mere 17 states require that the 

information provided be medically accurate 
— five of which don’t even require sex 
education 
in 
classrooms. 
Additionally, 

five states require only providing negative 
information about homosexuality, and 19 
states require that sex ed must teach that it is 
important to wait until marriage to have sex. 

The last time the state of Michigan 

updated its sex-ed standards was 2004, 
nearly 20 years ago. It includes relics of 
the past, such as forbidding teaching that 
abortion is reproductive health and requiring 
“stressing abstinence from sex.” While 
Michigan requires HIV/AIDS education, it, 
along with 19 other states, does not require 
sex education. Family planning drugs or 
devices (e.g. condoms) cannot be handed out 
to students. 

In fact, much of the content about 

contraceptives (labeled “risk reduction” 
in the summary) is left to the discretion of 
the school districts, which means that many 
Michigan students do not receive education 
about birth control options, leaving them 
vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases 
and teen pregnancy. 

Sex education has positive effects on 

the health of students. The Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention assesses 
that the benefits of providing quality sex 
ed to students include delaying sex, having 
fewer experiences with unprotected sex and 
avoiding sexually transmitted diseases and 
unintended pregnancy. The CDC provides 
sex ed standards for fifth, eighth and 10th 
graders, which culminates in the 10th 
grade with discussions about contraceptive 
options (which includes condoms as well 
as abstinence), consensual sex and sexual 
health. 

Leaving so much important information 

to the judgment of individual school 
districts means that the quality of sex ed 
varies widely across the state of Michigan. 
The required emphasis on the importance 
of abstinence and forbidding discussions 
of abortion as reproductive health in all 
Michigan public schools only works to limit 
the knowledge of Michigan students about 
birth control, which impacts their sexual 
health and safety going forward.

The 
sex 
education 
standards 
also 

make no mention of content regarding 
LGBTQ+ issues or sexual orientation in 
general. Considering that the percentage 
of Americans who identify as LGBTQ+ is 
growing, especially among the younger 
generations, it is imperative that such 
information 
be 
taught 
in 
Michigan’s 

public schools, which have over 1.5 million 
students.

While 
Republicans 
tend 
to 
prefer 

including abstinence and Democrats were 
more likely to prefer including discussions 
about birth control, consent and sexual 
orientation, 
both 
Republicans 
and 

Democrats want some form of sex ed to be 
taught in the classrooms. But it’s difficult 
to get state lawmakers to be proactive in 
fighting for sex education due to the topic’s 
controversial nature. Even in progressive 
states, it can be difficult to implement sex ed 
reform; in California, comprehensive sex ed 
wasn’t required until 2016. 

In states with a Republican-controlled 

branch of government, like Michigan, 
implementing sex education reform can 
be even more difficult. Fifty-nine percent 
of Republicans think that premarital sex is 
morally unacceptable, compared to 27% of 
Democrats, leading many to oppose material 
that could be seen as encouraging students 
to have sex.

Not only does comprehensive sex education 

help to reduce rates of teen pregnancy and 
sexually transmitted diseases, but preaching 

abstinence doesn’t even help to reduce the 
rates of teenagers having sex. Studies have 
shown that abstinence-only education does 
not delay sex, but instead leaves students 
unsafe and at risk for pregnancy and sexually 
transmitted diseases. 

But few topics are as important 

to the Republican Party as abortion, 
which is the second-most important 
issue for Republicans when deciding 
which presidential candidate to vote for. 
States that emphasize abstinence in sex 
education have the highest rates of teen 
pregnancy and teen birth. Thirty-one 
percent of teenagers who get pregnant 
have an abortion; access to birth control 
dramatically 
reduces 
pregnancy 
and 

abortion among teenagers. While free 
and accessible birth control is a separate 
issue from sex education, it is possible that 
teen abortion rates would decrease if all 
states included a judgment-free discussion 
of contraceptives in their sex education 
and diminished the importance placed 
on abstinence. This could help to reduce 
abortion rates, something that Republicans 
certainly support. 

Michigan sex education needs to be 

updated. Stressing abstinence and making 
discussion of contraceptives discretionary 
only makes Michigan students unprepared 
for sex whenever they choose to have it. 
Considering that sex is a natural and vital 
human function, it is ignorant to assume 
that abstinence is a helpful way of teaching 
teenagers about sex, especially since it 
has been proven that comprehensive sex 
education reduces rates of unintended 
pregnancy 
and 
sexually 
transmitted 

diseases. Michigan, along with the rest of 
the country, must update its sex education 
standards in order to educate its students on 
safe sexual health and experiences.

Enough is enough — we must 

defend the Uighurs

O

n Monday, March 22, the United 
States, the United Kingdom and 
Canada coordinated with the 

European Union in sanctioning China over 
their treatment of Uighur Muslims in their 
country. This move begs the question: why 
did this policy take so long to be enacted? 

The Uighurs are a minority Turkic-

Muslim population located mainly in 
northwestern China who have recently 
become the target of Chinese monitoring 
and detention. Starting in 2016, the 
Chinese government was found to have 
been creating “re-education camps,” or 
facilities in which they captured and 
imprisoned the Uighurs. China spent 
a long time denying that their camps 
were actually being used for malice. 
Instead, China asserts that the prisoners 
were simply being re-educated because 
some 
had 
become 
“extremists,” 

although no such evidence exists. In 
2018, the Chinese government finally 
acknowledged that these places existed 
and were not for re-education. They 
said they were imprisoning individuals 
for low-level crimes and vocational 
training. However, anecdotal accounts 
completely reject this notion. 

In 2019, U.N. representatives sent a 

letter to the U.N. High Commissioner 
explaining their concern with the large 
number of Uighurs being imprisoned, 
and the fact that the Chinese government 
was violating human rights laws. During 
former 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s 

administration in September 2019, the U.S. 
finally spoke up and condemned China’s 
actions on an international scale. Critically, 
former President Trump himself said 
in the summer of 2020 that he had been 
holding off on sanctioning China over their 
treatment of the Uighurs for the past year 
to preserve trade talks. This leads us to the 
question of where we should morally draw 
a line between our economic prosperity 
and human rights abuses happening in 
other countries. 

It is no secret that economics and global 

politics play a massive role in domestic 
politics, but this issue highlights how far 
will some countries, specifically the U.S., 
will go to protect trade talks and economic 
negotiations when human rights abuses 

are transpiring every day. The protection 
of human life and preservation of human 
rights must be the utmost priority. 

One 
major 
goal 
of 
the 
Biden 

administration must be to build back the 
U.S.’s image on the international stage after 
world leaders both literally and figuratively 
laughed at Trump and the country. From 
Trump criticizing NATO to taking the U.S. 
out of the U.N. Human Rights Council, our 
international reputation has taken a hit. 

While President Joe Biden did return 

the U.S. to the United Nations Human 
Rights Council, this is not enough. 
Taking a firm stance on human rights 
would set the ball in motion for the 
U.S. to come back as a key player in the 
international community. Joining in 
on these sanctions is a step in the right 
direction, but it would be even better if 
the U.S. decided to stop doing business 
with companies associated with Uighur 
labor, such as Nike, Amazon, Gap, Adidas 
and many more. 

Biden should call on the U.S. Senate to 

fast-track and pass H.R.6210, the Uighur 
Forced Labor Prevention Act. This act, 
which passed the House of Representatives 
on a bipartisan 406-3 vote, ended up stalling 
in the Senate committees. If Biden is truly 
committed to ensuring Uighurs in China 
are treated fairly and better protected, he 
must use the bully pulpit of the presidency 
and place a magnifying glass on this issue 
for the world. 

The time to favor economic benefits 

over the internment of hundreds of 
thousands of individuals and human rights 
abuses is over. We as a society need to 
recognize that our economy and individual 
monetary success pales in comparison 
to the livelihood of individuals we may 
not personally know. It is imperative that 
as we continue to pressure the Biden 
administration about the human rights of 
people of color in this country, we do not 
forget that his influence goes far beyond 
just these 50 states. If Biden takes a firm 
stance on defending the Uighurs, we can 
finally say our president is working for 
everyone.

Student debt is at ridiculous levels — we need help now
T

his past summer, while many students 
had just wrapped up a difficult transition 
to virtual education during their second 

semester of the academic year, the University of 
Michigan’s Board of Regents decided to approve a 
tuition increase of 1.9% for the upcoming year. For 
many, that increase — however small it may have 
been — was a kick to the face. An increase in our 
financial burden was an unnecessary edition to the 
agenda during an already stressful pandemic. 

As we are approaching the one year mark since the 

Board approved that change, and because on March 
18, the U.S. Department of Education announced 
they will forgive $1 billion in student loan debt, let’s 
consider the implications for the students — both 
at the University and elsewhere — who have been 
struggling with tuition costs and subsequent loans. 

It is important to note that said announcement 

is a bit deceiving — debt relief will be given to 72,000 
students who attended institutions that closed 
abruptly or were involved in cases of fraud, but not to 
students at most reputable universities. For those of us 
who are not in that category, a proposal is in the works 
for $10,000 in student debt to be universally forgiven.
Student loan debt has skyrocketed in recent years and 
we should be happy, to a certain extent, that President 
Joe Biden is aware of the problem. U.S. student loan 
debt is currently estimated to be around $1.7 trillion 
dollars, distributed among a collective of 45 million 
borrowers in 2021. It is now considered “the second-
highest consumer debt category,” according to Forbes. 

So where has the problem come from? Demand for 

college is higher than ever before, but instead of figuring 
out ways to make college more affordable for students, 
our country has adopted a rather prodigal loan policy 
that simply lends money to students to make that 
desired education affordable — even if it isn’t. 

This mindset is the crux of the multi-billion 

dollar crisis we are in. It is an economic injustice of 
sorts — the government is distributing loans to fund 
the belief that the investment of higher education 
will eventually be worthwhile, while for millions of 
Americans the only reality is simply debt.

This reality is why the University’s recent tuition 

hike should not be unexpected. Theoretically, there 
are no limits on what schools can charge. While 
this culture of ever-increasing tuition is certainly 
frustrating for the average student, at the moment, 
it seems that this trend is only going to continue. In 
the meantime, tangible solutions to forgiving student-
loan debt need to be pushed. 

Thus, we need to be thinking critically about 

our representatives’ currently proposed plans, as 
Biden’s isn’t the only one up for debate. The current 
plans are as follows: Biden’s $10,000 plan, a differing 
Democratic plan to cancel $50,000 per borrower and 
the rather radical plan to cancel all debt, as pushed 
by progressive legislators, including Sen. Bernie 
Sanders, I-Vt.

Biden’s current stance is that the $50,000 will not 

happen, and thus neither will Sanders’s. After the 
President’s short and to-the-point statement that 
he would not consider such a plan, he followed it up 
with some more explanation. He cited the private 
versus public institutional difference in student-loan 
debt that made a $50,000 minimum unjust for those 
not attending Ivy League-like universities. But, it 
seems as though some of Biden’s arguments may 
be unfounded and congressional members, seeking 
to push the $50,000, do not seem to be willing to 
concede as a result. 

Regardless, if we do not act swiftly, the severe 

economic and racial disparities that have resulted 
from student loan debt are only going to be 

exacerbated . Due to already existing inequities, Black 
families in the United States tend to take on student 
loan debt at both higher rates and in riskier forms 
compared to their white counterparts. Essentially, 
debt is pushing Black borrowers into greater financial 
risk. At this rate, various economists predict student 
loan debt will total as much as $3 trillion by the end 
of the next decade. That figure is guaranteed to be 
riddled with significant racial and socioeconomic 
inequities.

Thus, the argument I hope to make clear to both 

legislators and university officials is two-fold. First, 
for legislators: While short-term solutions such as 
various degrees of debt-relief plans are definitely 
going to make some impact, our thoughts need to be 
oriented toward long-term action. The crisis is not 
going to be halted by a $10,000 proposal or even a 
$50,000 one; think critically about the problems we 
face and how to redirect our current model. 

Second, to the universities: Acknowledge the 

tuition crisis and how our loan structure is only 
serving to increase the problem. Start working on 
ways to decrease tuition and make the investment in 
higher education one that everyone can afford.

Neither task is an easy one to pursue, but 

economists have warned us of the disaster on our 
hands and the long-term implications of it. It seems, at 
the moment, there is no perfect solution, but that does 
not mean there is no solution at all. We must work 
alongside legislators and fix the crisis permanently, 
not just for the short-term. As a first step, tuition 
hikes during the middle of a pandemic are likely not 
a strategic solution to addressing this dilemma. This 
summer, let’s avoid those.

My beef with the vegan community

I

f you’ve clicked on this article, you’ve 
likely done so for one of three reasons: 
You’re a proud omnivore who gets 

ticked off by the preachings of vegans; you’re 
a dedicated vegan, or aspiring to be, who is 
likely already a bit irritated by the title; or you 
love a good debate and are simply curious as to 
how this goes. To clear the air right away, I am 
not here to egg on those meat and dairy-loving 
people who continue to patronize veganism 
and roll their eyes when vegans boast of all the 
benefits of their way of eating (I’m talking to all 
my Ron Swansons out there). I’m also not going 
to engage in the typical points of opposition to 
veganism. I won’t go on and on about how you 
can’t get enough protein on a vegan diet or that 
it’s not sustainable or filling enough. 

Where I do take issue is with the religious 

fanaticism that can be found in the vegan 
community: when staunch supporters of the 
philosophy believe this way of eating is best for 
everyone. The unspoken (or outright spoken) 
idea that those who eat animal products are 
less than in some capacity is ignorant and 
all too quickly dismisses one very real and 
important truth: Veganism isn’t suitable for, 
nor does it benefit, everybody. There are going 
to be people who cannot and should not adopt 
a vegan diet, because for them, it is likely to do 

more harm than good to their mental and/or 
physical health. 

Veganism will very rarely be suitable to 

people who have had restrictive eating disorders. 
Moreover, “vegan eating disorder recovery” 
is a dangerous game and there will be very 
few who can successfully recover while being 
vegan because the idea of vegan eating disorder 
recovery is a self-contradictory statement. 

Think about it: What would recovery 

from a restrictive eating disorder entail? It 
would mean dropping all restrictions and 
challenging long-held food rules and beliefs 
in an attempt to rewire established neural 
pathways. To do this, one would have to 
actively stimulate this fear response by facing 
those foods they forbid until the presence 
of that food or thought of consuming it is no 
longer interpreted as a threat. Since a central 
component to veganism is the avoidance of 
animal products, one’s recovery, if attempted 
vegan, would not allow them to address these 
foods they are also restricting. 

Of course, the reason for restricting animal 

products can be more nuanced here. Maybe 
they are not afraid, per se, of those foods 
veganism requires they cut out. But they are 
most certainly deterred from them. 

Each person will have to get at the reason 

why that is. Is it solely out of respect and 
honor for animal rights? If so, then yes, there 
is no reason to encourage one to eat animal 
products if it crosses an ethical boundary they 
intentionally maintain. But, I would also add, 
you can always return to veganism because 
of your ethical values in the future. It may be 
worth at least taking a break from veganism if 
and when you are feeling too restrictive and like 
you may be slipping into the terrain of an eating 
disorder. This might look like heightened fear 
and anxiety around the thought of consuming 
anything animal-based. 

For the wing of veganism that truly 

engages in it as a philosophy rooted in animal 
rights, I commend you for having such a noble 
intention. However, I believe there are many 
who, caught up in our diet and thin-obsessed 
society (now being obscured under the banner 
of “health”), choose to become vegan in an 
attempt to finally frame this restriction as 
“right” or “healthy.” 

Is your dedication to veganism rooted 

in your belief that it is environmentally 
friendly? Even this is being debated in 
recent discourse. Ecologist Allan Savory put 
forth his compelling argument for “holistic 
management and planned grazing” in his Ted 
Talk and his method calls for the use of more 

livestock to re-green the Earth’s arid lands 
and significantly reduce atmospheric carbon. 
The Savory method is undoubtedly in need of 
more studies to prove if the theory is applicable 
across different contexts, but my main point 
is, would you be willing to leave complete 
veganism if it didn’t do the wonders for the 
environment you believed it did? 

If your dedication to veganism is neither 

rooted in environmental and or ethical beliefs, 
I am led to believe you may be clinging to it 
out of fear and a belief that it is inherently the 
healthiest way to eat. And if you have rigid 
food rules forbidding all animal products 
because you believe they are harmful to your 
health, I’d encourage you to read more into the 
diagnostic criteria of orthorexia. In fact, the 
line separating veganism and orthorexia can 
be easily blurred and one might go back and 
forth between the two terrains unknowingly. 
A study on this connection between 
restrained eating behaviors and veganism 
and vegetarianism found that vegans and 
vegetarians exhibited more orthorexic eating 
behaviors than those who eat red meat. A 2018 
article from The Independent also highlights 
numerous lived experiences where people 
hide their eating disorders behind veganism.

In short, that is why recovery from a 

restrictive eating disorder will have to have 
zero restraints on any food groups (allergies 
and intolerances aside). More often than 
not, allowing restriction to continue in any 
capacity during recovery attempts, such as by 
continuing to keep animal products off-limits, 
will result in the eating disorder voice living 
on, albeit a bit quieter. 

Even when one is post-recovery and feels 

far-removed from their eating disorder, any 
restrictive way of eating could be triggering 
and slowly send them back down a dangerous 
path. Because it is hard to realize you’re back 
on that path when already on it, you’re better 
off not embarking on it in the first place. Those 
who have recovered from a restrictive eating 
disorder, are in the process of doing so or who 
more generally have a tendency to engage in 
disordered eating behaviors, are the perfect 
example of a population who should not be 
engaging in fully-fledged veganism. 

Moving forward, let’s collectively be 

mindful of the fact that, for some, veganism 
can be a gateway into an eating disorder 
and it should not be hailed as the all-curing, 
omnipotent way of eating it currently is.

No sweaters in my oven

W

hen my parents were 
dating during the 90s 
in New York City, my 

mom kept her sweaters in their 
oven. My mom said the kitchen was 
too small and gross and they needed 
the storage space. They used to tell 
that story from time to time when I 
was growing up, often when my dad 
commented on my mom’s cooking 
(which frequently utilized an oven 
during my childhood). He seemed 
to be saying, “Look how far she’s 
come.” 

Recently, I’ve been thinking 

about the sweaters in the oven. Our 
poor oven, which is lucky if it gets 
lunch off from roasting chickpeas 
or brussels sprouts, would be 
thrilled to have a couple of days 
protecting some sweaters, I’m sure. 
This semester, my pandemic fatigue 
has taken the form of meal-time 
existential dread, and every time I 
start to chop my silly little brussels 
sprouts, I try to imagine myself with 
the kind of life where the oven is 
most useful as a dresser. I can’t. 

Perhaps, if the pandemic had not 

made it so that I was less than five 
steps from my oven 23 hours per 
day, I would feel differently. In the 
alternate pandemic-free reality, I’d 
probably have a small meal plan. I’d 
go to events with food advertised, 
order out occasionally and throw 
something quick together if I 
could stop at home between 5-9 
p.m. Instead, I cook all but one 
meal a week, ordering takeout on 
whichever night it is that Soylent 
or starvation doesn’t feel like a 
reasonable 
alternative 
to 
food 

preparation. 

The sweaters, which I’ve been 

thinking about lately when I go to 
roast my veggies, are a symbol to me 
of the small ways that the pandemic 
has changed me. Cooking nearly 
every meal, while both necessary 

and mundane most of the time, 
feels like a significant step toward 
something resembling adulthood. 
But as someone who grew up 
hearing about the “20s in New York” 
lifestyle, it also sometimes feels like 
a regression from modernity. My 
mental image of young adulthood 
failed to include meals requiring 
multiple pans and 45 minutes of 
oven time. 

The pandemic has forced a type 

of domesticity on us all, but for me, it 
has also rewired my priorities. I no 
longer want the most competitive, 
prestigious career at any cost. I 
no longer want the type of job 
that forces you to eat takeout six 
nights per week. I want to be able 
to cultivate my relationships in the 
slow, careful way that I cook my 
food and I want a job that allows me 
to do that.

I think it’s likely that we will see 

a sort of “roaring 20s” as people 
are finally able to safely let loose. 
My prevailing feeling, however, 
is a desire to stay close to the 
familiar. I’m not itching to travel 
the world or to take a big job in a 
place away from friends or family. 
I’m not excited to become so busy 
flitting from one thing to the next 

that I don’t have time to make my 
sprouts. 

To 
me, 
the 
pandemic 
has 

been one long “deserted island” 
question. When shit really hits the 
fan, who do you want to be stuck 
with — physically or emotionally? 
For now, for who knows how long, 
surrounding myself with people I 
would want to be stuck with on an 
island is my driving force. 

I’m not really sure what I want to 

do after I graduate, but in the past 
few weeks, I’ve watched so many 
talented writers lose their jobs. I’m 
watching my own talented friends 
across many different fields struggle 
to get paid employment of any kind. 
I’ve watched the incredible dearth 
of support given to working mothers 
throughout 
the 
pandemic. 
I’m 

feeling my ambition shrivel behind 
a computer screen as I fail to see 
examples of hard work paying off. 

For today — in a way that feels very 

not-21 of me — it’s the vision of the 
people that I love around the dinner 
table that is keeping me going. The 
oven will need to remain sweater-free. 

A

mid the recent onslaught of mass shootings, 
financial market instability and attacks on 
our democracy, I have increasingly found 

myself retreating to the comfort of my television 
for an escape. As events have worsened, my show 
selection has circled the drain from “Normal People” 
and “Master of None” down to the depths of “Big 
Mouth” and “Glee” (say what you will, but Marley 
and Jake made season four watchable). However, 
things began looking up a couple of weeks ago, when 
I accidentally stumbled upon a work of genius that I 
never adequately appreciated in my youth: “Phineas 
and Ferb.”

I, like many others born between 1998 and 2002, saw 

the show’s campy first few episodes and quickly aged 
out of the target demographic, leaving it behind for teen 
shows like “iCarly” and “Victorious.” Sadly, that left me 
with a bad taste in my mouth, having viewed it as boring 
and formulaic. However, when I revisited the show as 
an adult, I finally saw its true vision.

Even though they get a lot of screen time, I saw that 

the titular Phineas and Ferb really aren’t the main 
characters. See, they are both too “good” in the boring 
Captain America sense, whereas both Candace and 
Dr. Doofenshmirtz provide the show with conflict, 
compromise, excitement, tragedy and — through their 
human flaws — relatability. While I could go on for 
pages about the genius of Candace’s character, I will 
save that for a future column. Instead, I want to talk 
about Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, a comically inept 
villain on first look. I mean, his corporation is literally 
called “Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc.,” so he has to be the 
bad guy, right?

Not necessarily. While he inexplicably wants to 

rule the Tri-State Area — despite never showing an 
inclination to run for public office — his only real goal 
is to make his daughter happy. I mean, it’s kind of 
incredible to have a character who spends his tragic 
childhood abandoned and isolated, yet when he 
becomes a parent himself, and despite a divorce, he is 
not only a caring father but a truly good man. He never 
kills and rarely seeks to harm anyone, besides Perry 
the Platypus, who, in all honesty, kind of has it coming. 
He shows no resentment toward his ex-wife. He even 
befriends his mortal enemy at the end of the series and 
begins fighting for the “good” guys.

Doofenshmirtz does this because he wears his 

heart on his sleeve and broadcasts his emotions, 

which is an almost-Herculean feat for such a 
fundamentally stunted man. He is precisely the kind 
of complex, flawed and three-dimensional character 
that our culture has come to appreciate in recent 
years. However, he subverts the antihero archetype 
by having a comedic moral gray area as opposed to 
the objective darkness embodied by Walter White 
of “Breaking Bad” and Rick Sanchez of “Rick 
and Morty,” two of the most ubiquitous fictional 
characters of the last decade.

In the #MeToo era, many have falsely claimed that 

men are under attack, but that isn’t really accurate. 
Instead, this era presents a unique opportunity for 
us to redefine manhood from the outdated toxic 
definition that uplifts the likes of Brett Kavanaugh, 
Harvey Weinstein and every Brad and Chad on Greek 
Row. It is a horrific culture that leads women to cover 
their drinks, never walk home alone and feel unsafe in 
their own communities. That kind of environment was 
created, cultivated and perpetuated by men, and we 
cannot allow the inherent sexism within that predatory 
culture to exist. 

Instead, we need to replace our heroes with paragons 

of non-toxic masculinity like Anthony Mackie, Harry 
Styles and, yes, Heinz Doofenshmirtz who embrace 
their emotions and express their individuality, 
displaying courage in the face of potential societal 
backlash. These men inspire me to improve myself 
every day and to be an ally to the women and LGBTQ+ 
people who face unspeakable injustices. 

Together, we as men can follow in their footsteps 

by being allies and extending a helping hand to get 
informed about what we can do. That yearning for 
understanding coupled with an embrace of facts that 
might be uncomfortable for us to face is exactly what a 
real man does. A real man fights for the downtrodden; 
he doesn’t trample. A real man expresses emotion; he 
doesn’t hide beneath alcohol and anger. A real man is 
proud of being a man, but he doesn’t demean those who 
aren’t.

Generation Z has the opportunity to walk away 

from toxic masculinity and embrace a gentler, 
friendlier and more Doofenshmirtz-ian form of 
manhood. That is our greatest challenge — and my 
most ardent hope.

who’s putting all the work in to get 
to that point gets nothing out of it.” 

That much has been true for the 

last four years with Livers and of 
college athletes for decades. Even if 
Livers goes on to a successful NBA 
career and makes millions of dollars 
playing the sport professionally, 
he’ll still have been prevented from 

making the money he earned for 
four years. That’s bad enough in its 
own right. 

This week’s news made it 

even worse. On Friday, Michigan 
announced that Livers underwent 
successful surgery on his right foot 
after a stress fracture caused him to 
miss the entire NCAA Tournament. 
Buried in the press release was 
Livers’s timetable: “Recovery is 
expected to be a minimum of six 
months,” the statement said. 

For four years, Livers — unlike 

thousands of other college athletes 
— had a money-making light at the 
end of the tunnel. As an athletic 
forward with a 41.2% career 3-point 
shooting percentage, Livers was 
widely projected to be a second-
round NBA Draft pick a month ago. 

Now, few mock drafts predict 

Livers will be selected at all. One NBA 
executive said via text that Livers’s 
draft expectation was “all over the 
second round” before his injury. Now, 
according to the same executive, 
Livers is less likely to be drafted 
because of how long he’ll be out, 
though, it was added that Livers going 
“late second round (is) still in play.” 

Before the season, Livers said 

that the primary feedback he got 
from NBA teams in the pre-draft 
process last summer was to stay 

healthy. More important than any 
improvements in his play, he did 
exactly that for four months. 

Then, 
on 
the 
morning 
of 

Michigan’s Big Ten Tournament 
semifinal against Ohio State, it was 
announced that Livers had suffered 
a stress fracture, sidelining him 
indefinitely. If that had been the 
extent of Livers’s injury, it would’ve 
been sad enough — a senior, in his 
final college season, losing the event 

he’s worked toward for four seasons. 

With surgery required, Livers 

will now miss pre-draft workouts 
and the NBA Combine. He’ll 
also miss the Summer League 
and potentially the beginning of 
the regular season, reducing the 
likelihood he’ll find a Duncan 
Robinson path into making millions 
of dollars if he goes undrafted. 

The fragility of sports careers 

isn’t exclusive to college athletes. 

Every year, dozens of professional 
players have their careers derailed 
by injury. But at least they were able 
to make money while they were 
playing. Livers couldn’t. 

Right now, the Supreme Court 

is debating the legality of college 
players being unpaid by their 
schools. In Congress, Sen. Chris 
Murphy, D-Conn., introduced The 
College Athlete Economic Freedom 
Act earlier this year. If passed, it 
would allow players to profit off their 
name, image and likeness — a move 
the NCAA could also make on its 
own. 

Either solution would change 

college sports forever. A player 
like Livers would no longer spend 
four years unable to profit off the 
financial value that he provides to 
his school and to the NCAA. As a 
beloved athlete in a sports-crazed 
college town, Livers would have 
had no shortage of sponsorship 
opportunities. The same goes for 
his teammates, many of whom 
will never play in the NBA. 

Junior guard Adrien Nunez, for 

example, played just 3.2 minutes 
per game this year. But with over 
a million TikTok followers, he 
would probably have a chance to 
make more money than any other 
Wolverine. 

“It doesn’t even have to be 

about how good of a player you are 
compared to this other player and 
you’re getting paid just because you 
average 20 points a game,” Livers 
told ESPN. “Now, guys could focus 
on art, music, selling clothes. … 
We’re not just basketball players, 
we’re human beings too.” 

None of this is to say that there 

isn’t value in college sports. Livers 
needed his four years at Michigan to 
develop into an NBA prospect. But 
even a player like Gonzaga’s Jalen 
Suggs, who has used this season to 
jump from a low-lottery prospect to 
a consensus top-five pick, is being 
exploited by the NCAA.

Against UCLA on Saturday, 

Suggs hit a shot that the NCAA 
will use in advertising campaigns 
for generations. On CBS, 12 
million people watched along. If 
the NCAA would allow him to, 
Suggs could go back to Spokane 
on Tuesday morning and sign 
an advertising deal with every 
business in town.

Fortunately for Suggs, though, 

his multi-million-dollar payday is 
only a few months away. Thanks 
to an unfortunately-timed stress 
fracture, Isaiah Livers isn’t so lucky. 

With one rule change, it wouldn’t 

have to be this way.

Wednesday, April 7, 2021 — 15

With a one-goal lead and two 

minutes left on the clock, the 
Michigan women’s soccer team 
prepared to defend a corner. Rutgers 
lined up in the box, leaving only one 
player forward, and the Wolverines 
assembled to protect their precious 
lead. The ball fluttered into the near 
post and bodies flew toward it. In 
the middle of the scrum, Scarlet 
Knights forward Nneka Moneme 
headed the ball into the back of the 
net. Tie game.

Neither team scored in overtime 

and the end result was a 1-1 tie 
between Michigan (5-3-3 Big Ten) 
and No. 24 Rutgers (6-2-3) after 
double overtime. 

The 
Wolverines’ 
offense 

operated 
smoothly 
during 
a 

scoreless first half. They easily 
passed 
through 
the 
Scarlet 

Knights’ press, especially from 
the back. The defensive line 
maintained 
their 
composure 

and found the passes needed to 
move the ball up the field. After 
passes from the defenders broke 
Rutgers’s first line of defense, the 
Michigan midfielders had plenty 
of space to turn and find the next 
pass, creating several scoring 
opportunities.

The Wolverines’ best chance 

came in the 17th minute after a 
throw-in 
combination 
between 

sophomore 
forward 
Danielle 

Wolfe and senior midfielder Nicki 
Hernandez gave the latter time for 
a shot that hit the far post. A few 
minutes later, Hernandez drove 
down the left flank and set up Wolfe 
with a chance just in front of goal, 
but a frantic block from Rutgers 

kept the score level at zero. 

In 
the 
second 
half, 
the 

Wolverines had more difficulty 
breaking down the Scarlet Knights’ 
defense. Rutgers marked players 
more closely, making it harder for 
Michigan to find space with the 
ball. However, in the 60th minute, 
after giving the ball away with poor 
first touch at the top of the box, 
Hernandez quickly won it back, 
spun to her left and scored.

“I 
figured 
out 
where 
the 

defenders were, and since they were 
both on one side, I could just do 
one move,” Hernandez said. “With 
the goal being wide open, I always 
love going far post, and luckily that 
worked.”

With a strong defensive effort 

through the first 60 minutes, 
Michigan looked likely to hold onto 
that lead. In addition to helping 
Michigan build out of the back, 
senior defender Alia Martin was 
crucial to keeping Rutgers contained 
with multiple clearances and tackles, 
constantly communicating to help 

the team keep their shape. 

“We’re 
continuing 
to 
try 

and improve on our defensive 
organization to make sure that we 
make it difficult for other teams 
and predictable for ourselves,” 
Michigan coach Jennifer Klein said. 
“We want to find our opportunities 
to regain the ball.”

But the defense started to show 

some cracks after the Wolverines 
took the lead, with senior goalkeeper 
Hillary Beall needing to make 
seven saves. Effective crosses from 
the Scarlet Knights threatened the 
back line, and in the end, Michigan 
conceded the tying goal off a corner 
with two minutes remaining. The 
game 
remained 
deadlocked 
in 

overtime, and after a dominant first-
half and an early second-half goal, 
Michigan had to settle for a tie in its 
last game of the regular season. 

“Unfortunate to give up a goal 

in the last little bit,” Klein said. 
“Hopefully it will be a learning 
experience for us now going into the 
postseason.”

Senior forward Isaiah Livers injured his foot during the Big Ten Tournament.

ALLISON ENGKVIST/Daily 

Michigan senior midfielder Nicki Hernandez scored in the 60th minute.

Throughout 
the 
Michigan 

men’s lacrosse team’s season, the 
Wolverines have often relied on 
only a few players for scoring. 

Sunday told a different story. 

Eight different players reached the 
back of the net, including hat tricks 
from sophomore attackman Josh 
Zawada and sophomore midfielder 
Jake Bonomi, making it an all-
around team effort, as Michigan 
(2-5 Big Ten) used strong second 
and third quarters to propel it to 
a 13-10 road victory over Johns 
Hopkins (2-5). 

The first quarter was evenly 

matched with both teams finding 
chances. Scoring came in spurts, 
including one 15-second stretch 
during which the Wolverines 
and Blue Jays combined for three 
goals. The game looked to be a 
back and forth scoring affair after 
a 3-2 Blue Jays first quarter lead. 

The first five minutes of the 

second quarter followed the same 
script, with each team scoring two 
goals. But Michigan took over the 
remainder of the quarter by scoring 
the next two goals while junior 
goaltender John Kiracofe made five 
of his 16 saves in the quarter. 

“I give John a lot of credit, 

he’s really grown into that role,” 
Michigan coach Kevin Conry 
said. “We always knew John had 
the talent and the intangibles. 
His leadership is why we went 
with him in the first place. And 
now you are starting to see the 
confidence kind of come out. He 
has worked incredibly hard to put 
himself in a position to be a high 
caliber goaltender, and he showed 
it today.” 

Going into halftime, Michigan 

led the Blue Jays 6-5. But with 
14 turnovers in the first half, the 
Wolverines wanted to reinforce 
their game slightly. 

“I give a lot of credit to Johns 

Hopkins as they were doing some 

nice things that they were able to get 
to our hands,” Conry said. 

Michigan’s halftime adjustments 

worked as it was very effective 
with the ball, committing just six 
turnovers in the second half as 
well as converting on all nine of 
its clearing attempts. In the third 
quarter, the Wolverines added three 
more goals to make for a 6-0 scoring 
run, resulting in a 9-5 Michigan 
lead. 

“The guys played not to lose, but 

to win,” Conry said. “When you 
start playing to win you just kind 
of feel the mojo. You snap the ball a 
little bit more and you run to space 
and so it was just more efficient.” 

Johns Hopkins settled in, going 

on a 5-2 scoring run to cut the 
Michigan lead to just one with four 
minutes left. But Michigan regained 
the momentum, scoring the final 
two goals to secure the victory. 

“(Junior attackman Bryce Clay) 

didn’t really show up in the stat 
sheet that much, but his ability to 
move off the ball was a big reason 
why Jake Bonomi gets open or 
(grad student midfielder Avery 
Meyers) gets a shot,” Conry said.“It 
is more about our unselfish play 
and how hard we work. I think at 
the first meeting, we felt offensively 
we were very stagnant, and I give 
(assistant coach Justin Turri) a lot 
of credit for getting these young 
kids to good spots where they are 
moving effectively.” 

Michigan hopes to learn from 

this win as it goes up against 
Maryland next weekend and looks 
to establish a winning streak. 

“The biggest thing is to learn 

from a win,” Conry said. “I think 
this young team’s handling of 
success is something that we haven’t 
been great at. Learn from a win.”

Wolverines ride mid-game stretch 

in win over Johns Hopkins

SportsWednesday: Livers’s injury epitomizes need for NIL reform

ALLISON ENGKVIST/Daily 

Michigan junior goaltender John Kiracoffe protected the net in its win.

The Michigan football team’s 

underwhelming 
2020 
season 

didn’t 
sit 
well 
with 
senior 

linebacker Josh Ross.

Since arriving in Ann Arbor 

in 2017, Ross helped establish 
a 
winning 
program 
under 

coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh. 
He 

was an All-Big Ten selection 
when Michigan came within 
a game of the College Football 
Playoff in 2018, and he made 
three starts in 2019 before an 
injury sidelined him until the 
Wolverines’ New Year’s Six 
bowl appearance.

Then came the disastrous 2020 

season.

Ross was a senior captain 

on last fall’s 2-4 team that lost 
as a three-touchdown favorite 
against Michigan State, fell to 
Indiana for the first time in 
three decades, suffered its worst 
halftime deficit in Michigan 
Stadium 
history 
against 

Wisconsin and lost to an 0-5 

Penn State team by double digits. 
Before last year, the Wolverines 
had never finished a full season 
without a home win. That 
changed, too.

Ross wasn’t going to let his 

career end on that note.

“My decision on coming back, 

it was unfinished business. That 
was pretty obvious,” Ross told 
reports via Zoom on Thursday. 
“Last year was not good enough 
for myself, not good enough for 
our team. I felt I had to come 
back. I had to come back, and we 
had to prove something and have 
a chip on our shoulder and go get 
it. That was my main reason.

“I didn’t know what coaches 

we were getting yet. Before all 
that, of course it was a blessing to 
get the guys we have in the staff 
now, but at the same time, for me, 
coming back was about proving 
myself and proving ourselves as 
a team and getting better, just 
building our football knowledge 
and building everything cause 
last year wasn’t good enough.”

Ross is returning for a fifth 

year to try to prove that Michigan 

is better than its 2020 record. But 
after Harbaugh hired an almost 
entirely 
new 
defensive 
staff 

during the offseason, Ross now 
finds himself at the center of a 
schematic overhaul.

Gone are the days of former 

defensive 
coordinator 
Don 

Brown’s blitz-happy aggression. 
Harbaugh 
brought 
in 
Mike 

Macdonald from the Baltimore 
Ravens 
and 
Mo 
Linguist 

from the Dallas Cowboys as 
co-coordinators 
to 
replace 

Brown, signaling a shift toward 
an NFL-style defense.

To Ross, that change offers the 

chance to immediately improve a 
unit that allowed the third-most 
points in the Big Ten last season. 
It also presents an opportunity 
to build on a career that has seen 
him rack up 136 tackles across 35 
appearances.

“As far as myself, I feel like I 

haven’t really shown everything I 
can do yet,” Ross said. “But more 
so not about myself — as a team 
we haven’t shown what we can 
really do yet. This year is gonna 
be big for us.”

There’s no guarantee he’ll 

return to his 2018 All-Big Ten 
form after a dropoff in 2020, but 
Ross could become a centerpiece 
of the Wolverines’ defense this 

fall. Whether that translates 
to 
winning 
will 
ultimately 

determine if Ross is happy with 
his decision to return for a fifth 
year.

“Last year wasn’t good enough 

as a team,” Ross said. “It wasn’t. 
I felt that for myself a lot, so I 
had to come back. There was no 
option, to be honest, for me.”

‘Last year wasn’t good enough’: Josh Ross return to Michigan to win

ALLISON ENGKVIST/Daily 

Michigan senior linebacker Josh Ross’s return to Ann Arbor was for one reason: winning.

THEO 
MACKIE


Michigan advances to National 
Championships with record tie

Michigan goes 2-2 against 
Maryland, Northwestern

Baserunning costs Michigan outs and runs

Standing on the edge of the floor 

before her routine, junior Natalie Wojcik 

watched as her teammate’s score came in 

at a 9.950, securing the win for Michigan 

and advancing it to the NCAA Gymnastics 

Championships. However, Wojcik still 

saluted the judges, stepped out on the 

floor and performed a strong routine that 

allowed the No. 4 Wolverines (20-2) to tie 

their program record team score at the 

NCAA Regionals over the weekend. 

The Wolverines showed some nerves on 

the first day of competition in the Regional 

Semifinals, but the team ultimately placed 

first and advanced. Michigan’s biggest 

errors in its first day of competition came 

on beam, the team’s first event of the day. 

None of the gymnasts fell off the beam, but 

there were many large balance checks that 

left the team with an uncharacteristically 

low score of 48.925 to start the meet.

Instead of letting its first rotation set the 

tone for the rest of the meet though, the 

Wolverines bounced back in the rest of the 

events, ending the meet in first place with 

a 197.650 and advancing to the Regional 

Finals. 

No. 13 UCLA also qualified for the next 

day of competition, trailing Michigan by 

0.600 points with a team score of 197.050. 

On Saturday, the Wolverines needed to 

place in the top two out of the four teams 

in their Regional Finals to qualify for the 

National Championships. Facing No. 5 

University of California, Berkeley, the Bruins 

and Ohio State, Michigan excelled on the 

competition floor yet again, placing first to 

secure its National Championship spot.

“I feel like people are paying attention 

to us and hopefully giving us the credit 

we deserve for being … in contention for 

winning that national championship,” 

Michigan coach Bev Plocki said. “It’s not a 

fluke when you (score over 198) three times 

in the same year, so I hope people are paying 

attention to the University of Michigan.”

The Wolverines began the day with 

a strong vault rotation, one of the team’s 

best events, to have an immediate lead in 

the meet. Junior Abby Heiskell started 

with a low score, but the rest of her team 

made up for it, led by two 9.950 vaults from 

senior Sierra Brooks and freshman Naomi 

Morrison. 

Using the energy from the first rotation, 

the Wolverines moved to bars, where they 

broke a program record score with their 

performance. 

“Abby Heiskell put us on a great note, 

hitting her first routine,” Brooks said. “It 

was beautiful, the dismount dropped right 

in, and right when that happens we just get 

extremely excited, and we’re not worried 

about making little mistakes that usually 

get to us.”

Heiskell started the rotation with a 9.950, 

which was matched by sophomore Gabby 

Wilson and Brooks. Wojcik anchored 

the rotation with a stuck landing on her 

dismount, winning the event title with a 

9.975. The high scoring performances kept 

Michigan in the lead with second place 

Golden Bears trailing by 0.375 points. 

Despite 
the 
Wolverine’s 
beam 

performance in the previous day’s 

competition, the team was able to stay 

consistent. Brooks posted a huge 9.950 

score, and Heiskell finished out the rotation 

with a solid 9.900 to keep the team’s lead 

going into its last rotation on the floor. 

The Wolverines kept their momentum 

on floor, with four gymnasts earning 

scores of 9.900, and Wilson topping the 

rotation with a 9.950. Wojcik finished the 

rotation with a 9.900, even though the 

team had already won the meet before her 

performance even began. 

“It’s great to have five solid routines 

before going into that anchor spot, because 

it definitely takes some of that pressure 

off,” Wojcik said. “You know that everyone 

else has done their job, and it sets you up 

to really just do your best and be carefree 

but also be able to hit and add another solid 

routine to the mix.”

Although 
Wojcik’s 
stellar 
routine 

wasn’t necessary in securing Michigan’s 

win, it pushed the team to tie its program 

record and give the Wolverines necessary 

confidence as they move into the National 

Championships. Michigan also posted the 

second highest score of any team in the 

country this weekend, only falling short to 

No. 1 Oklahoma.

“We are just hoping to continue 

building on this meet and have more meets 

like this at Nationals,” Wojcik said. “We’re 

in contention for a national title, and we 

know we’re capable of doing that, so we’re 

going to use our energy to get our goal 

accomplished.”

Brandon Lawrence had waited two years for his 

first college at-bat, and the freshman infielder got 

it in the top of the ninth inning against Maryland 

on Monday night. With his family in the stands, he 

homered to deep right field. 

It’s a moment Michigan coach Erik Bakich 

thinks Lawrence will never forget, but one of few 

things the rest of the Wolverines will remember 

— at least positively. The solo home run pulled 

the No. 25 Michigan baseball team (13-6 Big Ten) 

back within 10 runs of the Terrapins, capping off 

a 17-7 loss and a 2-2 weekend series split against 

Maryland (9-10 Big Ten) and Northwestern 

(10-8). Monday’s loss was an outlier compared 

to the first three games of the weekend, when 

Michigan rode its biggest strengths — pitching, 

defense and timely hitting, according to Bakich 

— to two wins. 

Redshirt sophomore left-hander Steven Hajjar 

earned another quality start on Friday night, 

allowing only two runs and three hits in 6.2 innings, 

but a strong start by the Wildcats’ Tyler Uberstine 

kept the score tied at two before the seventh-

inning stretch. Redshirt junior outfielder Danny 

Zimmerman led off the bottom of the seventh with 

a pinch-hit walk, and fifth-year catcher Christian 

Molfetta singled. Fifth-year transfer catcher Griffin 

Mazur topped off the rally with a first-pitch home 

run, giving the Wolverines a three-run lead they’d 

hold. 

Redshirt junior left-hander Ben Dragani took 

the ball for the second game against Northwestern, 

and like the other starters who succeeded Hajjar 

this weekend, Dragani couldn’t record even close 

to a quality start. His four innings and three runs 

did keep Michigan within shouting distance of the 

Wildcats, but outs on the basepaths cut rallies in the 

first and seventh innings short.

Down 4-1 in the ninth, the Wolverines quickly 

loaded the bases on a walk and a pair of singles. But 

not even the red-hot redshirt sophomore outfielder 

Jordon Rogers or Zimmerman, who was summoned 

to pinch-hit once again, could clear the table. 

“We had put a good amount of quality 

at-bats together and just made some hard outs,” 

Zimmerman said. “We started that inning by 

loading the bases. We can’t wait around to the ninth 

inning. We can’t always win in the ninth; we’ve got 

to do it earlier.”

Michigan didn’t heed that advice in the second 

game of Sunday’s doubleheader. Sophomore right-

hander Cameron Weston went four innings and 

allowed four runs, but a grand slam by sophomore 

catcher Jimmy Obertop neutralized Maryland’s 

early offensive damage. Michigan scratched out a 

run on a squeeze play in the seventh inning to take 

a 5-4 lead. 

“The wind was blowing in, and we felt good 

about (fifth-year transfer shortstop) Benjamin Sems 

getting a squeeze down,” Bakich said. “He executed 

it perfectly. There have been a couple of times when 

we’ve left runners on base. It was a tie game, and 

we usually like to play for the big inning, but this 

particular case of where we were in the game and the 

time of the game and how the game was going, it just 

seemed like trying to play for a run was the way to go.”

The Terrapins responded with a game-tying 

single in their half of the seventh, and with the game 

still knotted at five in the ninth, Bakich called on 

Zimmerman to pinch-hit once again. Although he 

faced mid to upper-90s velocity from Maryland 

reliever David Falco, Zimmerman was looking to hit 

a fastball. He did just that, belting a solo home run 

that gave Michigan a 6-5 lead that held. 

Then came Monday’s game, during which 

Maryland turned the basepaths into a carousel for 

3.5 hours. Senior right-hander Blake Beers allowed 

four runs in 3.1 innings, and the trail of relievers that 

followed him let in 13 additional runs.

“Our bullpen has been really good for the first 18 

games of the year, so I’m not going to put too much 

stock into what happened today,” Bakich said. “We 

just couldn’t stop the hot-hitting Maryland team 

today; they were on fire.”

Pitching and defensive struggles eliminated 

Michigan well before the final pitch had been 

thrown. In light of that, Bakich emptied the bench 

and gave Brandon Lawrence the opportunity to give 

the team a silver lining. 

Graduate transfer infielder Benjamin 

Sems laid down the bunt to perfection 

in the seventh inning of Sunday’s game 

against Maryland, sending the ball 

rolling past the pitcher to the third 

baseman. Sems was so close to first base 

by the time the ball had been collected 

that the Maryland third baseman didn’t 

even bother with a throw. 

Instead, he turned to see sophomore 

outfielder Clark Elliott sprinting around 

third base in an attempt to score two 

runs on the squeeze play. Since Sems 

was already safe at first base, the third 

baseman calmly turned and ran at 

Elliott, who was caught in a rundown 

and tagged out. The next batter, 

sophomore outfielder Tito Flores, hit a 

fly ball that would have been a sacrifice 

fly and would likely have scored Elliott 

if the Wolverines had just played it safe.

This sort of baserunning mistake 

was a recurring issue throughout the 

weekend series against the Terrapins 

and Northwestern, both of which 

Michigan split, as extremely aggressive 

baserunning turned into costly outs that 

limited runs.

“We made a couple of mistakes,” 

Michigan coach Erik Bakich said. “Just 

getting out on the bases, things come up 

that just need to be corrected, whether it 

be shortening a lead or extending a lead 

or getting a better jump.”

The Wolverines have run into 

several other outs in recent games, 

too. Redshirt sophomore outfielder 

Jordon Rogers was picked off of first 

base after getting a very aggressive 

lead during the loss to Northwestern 

on Sunday. He took several skips 

away from the base to disrupt the 

Wildcat left-hander staring him 

down from the mound but was 

made to pay for it when the pitcher 

threw over to first base. Rogers also 

ran into another out in a later game 

against Maryland on Monday when 

he was thrown out trying to steal 

third.

“There’s a lot that goes into base 

running, and we spend an extraordinary 

amount of time on it,” Bakich said. 

“It’s certainly created a lot of scoring 

opportunities for us over the years so it’s 

something we take a lot of pride in and try 

to use it and deploy it to our advantage. 

Some of the most successful teams 

we’ve had have been guys that have had 

that combination of speed and power 

throughout the lineup. Where there’s 

multiple ways to score, those seem to be 

the best offenses.”

Later 
in 
Sunday’s 
loss 
against 

Northwestern, Flores hesitated for a 

moment to advance on a pitch in the dirt, 

but decided to break for second base and 

was gunned down by the Wildcat catcher. 

As if on cue, the batter at the plate, redshirt 

junior outfielder Danny Zimmerman, 

smoked a double off the wall that likely 

would’ve scored Flores from first base had 

he not run into an out.

Elliott also was thrown out trying 

to score on a ground ball to shortstop 

in the Wolverines’ first game against 

Maryland. Elliott’s hesitation, like 

Flores’s, was costly as he waited a split 

second before aggressively trying to 

score on a softly-hit ground ball. He was 

caught in a rundown coming home and 

eventually tagged out.

“I think it was just unlucky,” 

sophomore catcher Jimmy Obertop said. 

“We’re always trying to be aggressive, 

it’s better to be in an aggressive state 

than a passive one.”

Bakich’s teams are known for being 

aggressive on the bases, and they have 

forced other teams into many errors 

this season. The mistakes this weekend 

may have cost the team several runs, but 

Bakich is not worried about his team’s 

aggressiveness on the bases in the long 

term:

“We want to be aggressive up to a 

calculated risk,” Bakich said. “The thing 

that we talked about is trying to be about 

50% successful in stealing bases. If we 

feel like we can steal the base with 80% 

success, then it’s worth taking the risk.”

Sophomore Clark Elliott’s baserunning error was one of many for Michigan during 
the start of this season.

Late defensive lapses cost 
Michigan against Wisconsin

In the 83rd minute, Wisconsin midfielder 

Murat Calkap placed the ball next to the corner 

flag, ready to deliver the corner kick. With a short 

run up and a swing of the leg, the midfielder 

sent a looping cross into the middle of the goal 

box, linking up with the powerful strike on the 

forehead of Badger forward Henri Tophoven. 

With ample force, the ball went flying past the 

Wolverines’ sophomore goalkeeper, Owen 

Finnerty.

The corner served as the winning goal for 

Wisconsin (2-7-1 Big Ten), as they upset No. 11 

Michigan (5-3-1 Big Ten) by a score of 3-2. 

“When we got to the first (crosses) we didn’t 

clear them well, so that’s something we do 

habitually,” Michigan coach Chaka Daley said. 

“I just think we got some unlucky bounces today. 

That’s not something we’ve ever really (dealt 

with). We haven’t conceded a set piece goal all 

year.”

Spectators were not deprived of exciting 

scoring opportunities during the first twenty 

minutes of the game. In the third minute, a 

deflected corner kick left a loose ball in the box 

for Wisconsin defender Moritz Kappelsberger. 

The defender put a close-ranged shot on net, 

but Finnerty dropped to a knee to stop the shot. 

Six minutes later, the Wolverines got a chance 

of their own, as sophomore midfielder Iñaki 

Rodriguez sent a header hurtling into the net, but 

Wisconsin goalkeeper Carter Abbott made the 

save with ease. 

In the 17th minute, Badgers forward Noah 

Melick had an excellent opportunity to score on 

a breakaway, but Finnerty rushed off his line to 

sweep up the ball. Three minutes later, a foul in 

the Wisconsin penalty box sent senior midfielder 

Marc Ybarra to the penalty spot. He sent Abbott 

diving in the wrong direction and netted the 

penalty kick, giving Michigan an early 1-0 lead. 

The next ten minutes were filled with 

offensive opportunities for the Wolverines, 

but they weren’t able to convert. Wisconsin 

eventually scored an equalizer in the 39th 

minute, as Badger defender Zach Klancnik 

zipped the ball into the corner of the goal. The 

score remained at 1-1 to conclude the first half. 

In the 60th minute, junior forward Derick 

Broche picked up the ball at the midfield line 

and carried the ball up the right side of the 

pitch with pace, trailed by a chasing Wisconsin 

defender. Broche displayed a series of high 

stepovers to swerve past one defender and used 

a heavy left-footed touch to gain space from a 

second. In a close-ranged one-on-one situation, 

Broche chipped the ball over the right shoulder 

of Abbott, concluding his brilliant solo run with 

clinical finesse. 

The Wolverines would carry their one 

goal lead up until the 74th minute, when 

Finnerty’s attempted corner kick clearance was 

unsuccessful, leaving the ball sitting in front of 

the net, providing an easy rebound finish for 

Melick. 

Tophoven’s 83rd-minute header put the 

Badgers up 3-2, and the score concluded that way. 

All three of the Wisconsin goals came off of set-

piece long passes. The final two were especially 

heartbreaking for Michigan, as the players 

watched their lead slip into a deficit during the 

final 15 minutes of play. 

“To be hard done by deflections is difficult, 

but we also didn’t do enough to extend that lead 

or defend a little bit better on the first balls,” 

Daley said. “All of those (goals) are off of second 

balls and deflections. It was nothing creative or 

to carve us apart or to outplay us.”
