Polls now open as 
three parties vye for 
assembly seats, offices

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily Staff Reporter

Central Student Government 

executive elections have arrived, 
and the University community 
has a host of candidates and plat-
forms to consider.

The Team

Running on The Team’s execu-

tive ticket are LSA junior Will 
Royster and LSA sophomore Matt 
Fidel, who will vie for CSG presi-
dent and vice president, respec-
tively.

Royster is currently the Black 

Student Union’s academic con-
cerns chair; Fidel previously 
served on the Social Responsibil-
ity Committee for the now-dis-
banded Sigma Alpha Mu.

The Team is CSG’s newest 

party, and its platform focuses on 
inclusiveness and uniting the stu-
dent body. One of its priorities is 

on-campus diversity, which The 
Team plans to target by advocat-
ing moving the Trotter Multicul-
tural Center to a more accessible 
location, among other initiatives.

The Team has also announced 

plans to increase CSG transpar-
ency by creating a text-message 
hotline, interactive newsletter 
and CSG-staffed coffee cart in 
Mason Hall.

In a prior interview with The 

Michigan Daily, Royster said The 
Team wants to focus on empow-
ering other students.

“What we really care about is 

empowering the campus through 
cross-campus 
collaboration,” 

Royster said. “Even our motto, 
‘Our Campus, Our Community, 
Our Commitment, Your CSG,’ we 
really mean that.”

Fidel said he and Royster want 

to focus more on change and less 
on politics.

“We aren’t worried about the 

credit; we’re worried about see-
ing change,” he said.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

Vote expected next 

week following 

review by resolution 

committee

By LEA GIOTTO

Daily Staff Reporter

After failing to secure the 

passage of a similar proposal last 
year, Students Allied for Free-
dom and Equality proposed a 

new divestment resolution at 
Tuesday night’s Central Student 
Government meeting.

SAFE 
is 
the 
University’s 

chapter of Students for Justice 
in Palestine, an international 
organization that stands for 
Palestinian solidarity on college 
campuses. One of the group’s 
primary goals is to advocate 
for the Boycott, Divest, and 
Sanctions movement, which in 
part asks institutions to divest 
from companies that allegedly 
facilitate the violation of Pal-

estinian human rights. Divest-
ment movements are typically 
group proposals made to a city 
or university board, requesting 
suspension of investments in 
companies that support unethi-
cal or immoral actions.

The proposed resolution asks 

CSG to support the creation of a 
committee through the Univer-
sity’s Board of Regents to evalu-
ate the University’s investments 
in four companies. In the resolu-
tion, SAFE specifically accused 
The Boeing Company, Cater-

pillar Inc., G4S and the United 
Technologies 
Corporation 
of 

profiting from alleged human 
rights violations against Pales-
tinians.

The meeting began with nine 

speakers voicing their position 
during the community concerns 
portion of the meeting. Eight of 
the speakers, including seven 
University students and an Ann 
Arbor resident, spoke in favor of 
divestment.

CAMPUS LIFE

Organizers recount 
historic event during 

50th anniversary 

celebration

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily Staff Reporter

Fifty years since the historic 

“Teach-In Against the Vietnam 
War,” a dozen retired Univer-
sity faculty members and activ-
ists took the stage in Angell Hall 
Auditorium to reflect on their 
experiences with activism Tues-
day.

In 
1965, 
approximately 
50 

University 
faculty 
members 

organized what they called a 
“Teach-In” — a protest and that 
would consist of University facul-
ty discussing the negative aspects 
of war continuously for a night.

Frithjof Bergmann, a philoso-

phy and romantic studies profes-
sor in 1965, was a main organizer 
of the protest. During the event, 
he said he and other University 
professors 
conceptualized 
the 

original teach-in after participat-

ing in an anti-war protest outside 
the White House.

“We thought, there has got to 

be something more we professors 
can do other than walking around 
until we had holes in our shoes,” 
Frithjof said during the event. 
“For me that was the beginning, 
and the idea that professors can 
do more than march in circles.”

Frithjof said more than 3,000 

individuals attended the 1965 
teach-in. The night consisted of 
debates, lectures and musical 
performances — all aimed at edu-
cating the University community 
about peace.

“It became obvious in that 

night, that actually one could 
make a difference in one night, 
and that was something that very 
few knew,” Bergmann said.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily, Thomas Mayer, 
who was an assistant professor 
of sociology during the teach-in, 
said participating in the protests 
propelled him forward in activ-
ism 
throughout 
his 
teaching 

career.

Research to address 

local impacts of 
fluctuating Great 
Lakes water levels

By IRENE PARK

Daily Staff Reporter

University grants are aiming 

to explore the impacts of the his-
torically high rate of water level 
fluctuation in the Great Lakes.

The University’s Graham Sus-

tainability Institute awarded 
seven grants, totaling $70,000, 
to 
American 
and 
Canadian 

researchers studying how Mich-
igan residents are adjusting to 
the fluctuations.

John Callewaert, director of 

the Integrated Assessment Cen-
ter at the Graham Sustainabil-
ity Institute, said changes in the 
lakes’ water levels could have a 
significant impact on regional 
habitats, recreation and shore-
front management.

To study those impacts, the 

University will award $10,000 
over a six-month period to each 

Town hall centers 
on construction 
plans approved by 
Board of Regents

By COLLEEN HARRISON

Daily Staff Reporter

Big changes are ahead for 

the North Campus Recre-
ation Building.

Last week, the University’s 

Board of Regents approved 

a $13 million renovation to 
the NCRB. The project will 
also include the construc-
tion of an 18,000 square foot 
addition. In 2013, the regents 
enacted a $65-per-term stu-
dent fee to fund renovations 
for the University’s unions 
and recreation facilities.

About 30 members of the 

North Campus community 
gathered Tuesday night to 
participate in a town hall 
with the firm contracted to 
complete the project.

Charles Lewis, the senior 

vice president of Integrat-
ed 
Design 
Solutions, 
led 

the meeting and presented 
attendees 
with 
mock-up 

renovation 
designs. 
Mike 

Widen, the director of Recre-
ational Sports, co-facilitated 
the meeting and helped field 
attendees’ questions.

“We wanted to take you 

through where we’re at in 
general with the planning,” 
Lewis said.

B UD DY SYST E M
ONLINE DEBATE OVER ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

A debate ignited online after 

Harvard University Prof. Lau-
rence Tribe criticized the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency’s 
“Clean Power Plan” while testi-
fying to the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives Subcommittee on 
Energy and Power, the Harvard 
Crimson reported.

Tribe said the plan — which 

centers on the regulation of coal 
and greenhouse gases from coal-
power plants — is unconstitu-
tional. In an article in the Wall 
Street Journal last year, Tribe 
advocates for environmentally 
safe practices, but condemns the 
EPA for asserting power beyond 
its authority.

Harvard Law School profes-

sors Richard J. Lazarus and Jody 

Freeman began trading respons-
es with Tribe over the past week 
on the Harvard Law Today web-
site. While the subject matter is 
controversial, Tribe described 
the arguments as within “the 
sphere of collegiality.”

University of Texas panel 
discusses student athletes

A panel discussion at the Uni-

versity of Texas, Austin tackled 
the contentious topic of compen-
sating student athletes for their 
participation in sporting events, 
the Daily Texan reported.

In October, national media 

outlets 
reported 
that 
Texas 

Athletic Director Steve Patter-
son expressed the possibility of 

paying the university’s student-
athletes in every sport. The 
suggested payment was report-
edly $10,000 per athlete annu-
ally, totaling $6 million each year.

Rep. Travis Clardy (R-Texas), 

a panelist, described the vari-
ous sources of revenue provided 
to coaches and schools, and how 
student-athletes are closed off 
from the benefits.

“In 2015, college sports teams 

have the television contracts, 
merchandising, EA sports video 
games and much more,” he said. 
“A whole lot of people are making 
money because of a bunch of kids 
putting on a jersey with a partic-
ular school’s colors on it.”

Around 6.2 million 
people are affected 

by congenital 

anosmia disorder

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

Imagine 
never 
smelling 

chocolate chip cookies fresh 
out of the oven, flowers in the 
spring or, in a potentially dan-
gerous situation, natural gas.

During last week’s TEDx-

UM conference, Michelle Krell 
Kydd, a flavor and fragrance 
expert, discussed congenital 
anosmia, a little-known disor-
der.

Engineering senior Eric Rie-

del and Art & Design freshman 
Sarah Jomaa both have con-
genital anosmia — which means 
they have not had a sense of 

smell since they were born.

“It hasn’t affected me too 

much,” Riedel said. “As I always 
say, it’s better than losing any of 
my other senses.”

Jomaa said she used to har-

bor concerns about her hygiene 
because she could not smell 
body odor.

“There was this time I went 

through this really obsessive 
phase of brushing my teeth, 
because I didn’t know when my 
breath smelled,” Jomaa said.

Kydd, a communications spe-

cialist at Alliance for the Arts 
in Research Universities, also 
lectures about olfaction, or the 
sense of smell. She spent much 
of her career working for com-
panies focused on fragrance 
and flavor like Ciao Bella Gelato 
Company and the Estée Lauder 
Companies.

“6.2 million people can’t 

smell,” Kydd said in her TED 
talk Friday. “And being nose 

blind stinks.”

She said one of the greatest 

dangers of being unable to smell 
is the inability to detect natural 
gas. While there are currently 
reliable mechanisms for car-
bon monoxide detection, there 
are none to detect natural gas. 
Instead, a chemical compounds 
called mercaptans are added to 
natural gas to give it a distinct 
smell. For those who cannot 
smell, however, this addition 
makes no difference.

“Luckily it hasn’t affected 

me, but natural gas leaks, most 
people can smell those because 
of the rotten egg smell in the 
air, but I am not able to detect 
those so hopefully that never 
affects me,” Riedel said. “It’s 
just another thing that I’m 
aware of and I have to be care-
ful about.”

Jomaa added that she wor-

ries about her inability to detect 
potential fires — if something 
was burning, she would not be 
able to smell it. Another issue 
that both Kydd and Riedel 
addressed was that people with 
anosmia cannot smell rotting 
food.

“The main way it affects me 

day to day is with spoiled food,” 
Riedel said. “Sometimes I have 
to get my roommate to check 
to see if my leftovers have gone 
bad, because I can’t smell.”

Riedel and Jomaa each noted 

that a common question that 
people ask once it is about the 
condition is whether or not they 
can taste. Both said they think 
they can taste, but probably not 
in the same way people who can 
smell do.

“I think I can (taste), because 

I don’t know any different,” 
Riedel said. “I have foods that 
I like, I have foods that I don’t 
like, just like everyone else. So I 
think I have the ability to taste, 
but I’m assuming that it’s obvi-
ously somewhat different from 
someone who can smell. Like 
I’ve said, I’ve never known any

The Germanwings 

Flight 9525 

went down while 

returning from Spain 

HALTERN, Germany (AP) — A 

stunned German town mourned 
16 students who went down 
aboard 
Germanwings 
Flight 

9525 on their way home Tuesday 
from a Spanish exchange, while 
the opera world grieved for two 
singers who were returning from 
performing in Barcelona — one of 
them with her baby.

“This is surely the blackest 

day in the history of our town,” 
a visibly shaken Mayor Bodo 
Klimpel said after the western 
town of Haltern was shocked by 
news that 16 students from the 
local high school and two teachers 
had been on the plane. They had 
just spent a week in Spain.

Some hugged, cried and laid 

flowers in front of the Joseph 
Koenig High School, where the 
10th graders had studied, and lit 
candles on its steps.

“This is pretty much the worst 

thing you can imagine,” Klimpel 
said at a hastily called news 
conference.

An announcement was made 

to students Tuesday lunchtime 
that “that we were all free now 
but we shouldn’t be happy,” said 
Christopher Schweigmann, 16, a 
10th-grade student who said he 
lost two good friends. Students 
went 
to 
a 
service 
Tuesday 

evening, and “everyone was in 
tears in the church,” he said.

“It’s impossible to believe that 

they all won’t be there anymore in 
the coming days,” he said.

Crisis counselors were at the 

school soon after the crash.

“I think many haven’t really 

grasped what happened, and I 
think the grief will come a bit 
later for many,” counselor Ingo 
Janzen said.

“The town is totally silent, 

nothing is happening anymore in 
town, everyone is like petrified,” 
said resident Gerd Schwarz, 64.

The town of 38,000 lies about 

80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast 
of 
the 
plane’s 
destination, 

Duesseldorf.

Officials confirmed that the 

school group was among the 150 

people on board the plane. Among 
the victims were also two opera 
singers, business travelers en 
route to a trade fair in Cologne 
and two babies.

A total of 67 Germans, many 

Spaniards, 
two 
Australians, 

and 
one 
person 
each 
from 

the Netherlands, Turkey, and 
Denmark 
were 
among 
the 

victims, 
according 
to 
their 

respective governments.

Spanish authorities were still 

trying to determine how many 
of their citizens were on board. 
The Mexican government said 
there were indications that one 
Mexican national was also among 
the victims.

The German students and their 

teachers spent a week in Llinars 
del Valles and were seen off at the 
town’s train station early Tuesday 
by their Spanish host families, 
said Pere Grive, the deputy mayor 
of the town of 9,000, about a 
45-minute drive from Barcelona.

German and Spanish students 

from the two towns have been 
doing such exchanges for at least 
15 years. The Spanish students 
had spent time in Germany in 
December.

Though not all of the build-

ing will be renovated, the focus 
will be on improving the flow 
of the facility, as well as chang-
ing its front entrance to make it 
more aesthetically pleasing.

“You drive by it today … it 

could be a warehouse, could be 
a computer science lab, could 
be a Costco without a sign,” 
Lewis said, explaining that the 
redesign will help passersby 
easily identify the NCRB.

The changes will include 

the addition of 18,000 square 
feet, as well as a gymnasium 
with 
multipurpose 
activity 

courts, a 16-person whirlpool, 
a table tennis room, locker 
room 
enhancements, 
floor-

ing upgrades, air-conditioning 
and large multipurpose group 
space. There are also plans 
to convert what are now five 
racquetball courts into four 
squash courts.

“I want to make sure that 

we’re doing the right thing by 
having this building scream 
‘come workout, come recreate,’ 
” Lewis said.

During the initial phases 

of construction, Lewis said, 

the building will remain open. 
However, it is set to close for a 
year during later stages of the 
renovations, starting in the 
summer of 2016. The NCRB’s 
closing will coincide with the 
Intramural Sports Building’s 
reopening, which closes the 
summer of 2015 for renovations.

Those in attendance at the 

event discussed the concerns 
of students who live on North 
Campus during the reconstruc-
tion, and those of individuals 
who pay for membership and 
workout at NCRB.

For 
LSA 
junior 
Katelyn 

Gaither, renovating the NCRB 
is a top priority.

“Right now with the NCRB, 

we don’t have the space neces-
sary to fulfill all the needs that 
are obviously addressed here,” 
she said.

She added that even though 

students and those paying for 
a membership can currently 
use the facilities, the NCRB 
struggles to accommodate at 
the North Campus population.

“Once you get here, when 

everyone’s trying to come in 
here, in rush hour, in the hot 
hours, there is no room. It’s 
stuffy. It’s suffocating, and 
it’s something they’re trying 
to address with these renova-

tions,” Gaither said.

Despite 
living 
on 
North 

Campus, Gaither still believes 
that inconveniencing users for 
a year would only be a small 
price to pay in order to gain 
more modern facilities.

“We’re willing to go through 

the change process in order 
to 
make 
something 
better 

because we know it’s going to 
make it better in the long run,” 
said Gaither.

Business junior Ian Savas — 

an executive board member for 
Building a Better Michigan, a 
student advisory group with 
a voice in University develop-
ment projects — said students 
often find themselves under-
represented at this type of 
meeting.

“A trend I tend to notice in 

these meetings is that students 
are not as interested in attend-
ing a meeting that they get an 
e-mail for, because they get 100 
e-mails about 100 things to go 
to,” he said.

Savas said the renovations 

will ultimately help students 
living on North Campus enjoy 
using the NCRB facilities.

“No one likes working out in 

a racquetball room where it’s 
hot and sweaty,” he said.

of seven teams of researchers to 
consider policy and management 
options for shoreline residents, 
businesses and government offi-
cials to adapt to the water level 
instability.

Later this year, four or five of 

the seven teams will be selected 
as part of the University’s Great 
Lakes Water Levels Integrated 
Assessment to participate in a 
more detailed project to help 
communities determine options 
to minimize the negative impacts 
of the water level fluctuations.

According a report by The 

Nature Conservancy and the 
National Oceanic and Atmo-
spheric Administration, the Great 
Lakes satisfy the needs of more 
than 45 million people and “serve 
as the backbone for a $4 trillion 
regional U.S. economy.”

The report noted that the 

lakes’ water levels can serve as 
indicators of climate change. 
Water levels rise and fall natu-
rally; however, the rate of this 
fluctuation has been historically 
high. In 2013, Lake Michigan and 
Lake Huron in particular reached 

historically low water levels.

NOAA has also noted the his-

toric speed at which Great Lakes 
water levels rose from January 
2013 to December 2014.

Because water level changes 

impact many different commu-
nities, the funded projects will 
focus on different aspects of 
water level fluctuations.

Paul Drevnick, an assistant 

research scientist at the Univer-
sity’s Biological Station and the 
School of Natural Resources and 
Environment, is researching land 
damages caused by water level 
fluctuation in Emmet County, 
which is located in the northwest 
tip of the Lower Peninsula. The 
county is one of the oldest coastal 
settlements of the Great Lakes 
region, and includes populated 
communities such as Mackinaw 
City and Petoskey.

“Much of the shoreline of 

Emmet County has low slopes, 
resulting in major changes in 
shoreline configuration between 
low and high water,” he said.

Drevnick said his team’s goal is 

to identify land that is vulnerable 
to the water level fluctuations 
and develop plans to monitor and 
reduce damage.

Land damage can change local 

land planning and zoning policy 
decisions. Richard Norton, chair 
and associate professor in the 
Urban and Regional Planning 
Program at Taubman College, 
said predicting how much water 
levels change would be important 
for residents who want to live 
near the lakeshore.

“The real challenge is when 

lake levels are low for an extend-
ed periods of time, people tend to 
want to build houses and cottages 
closer to the water,” Norton said.

Frank Marsik, an associate 

research scientist in the Depart-
ment of Atmospheric, Oceanic 
and Space Science who was also 
a grant recipient, wrote in an 
e-mail interview that his project 
will focus on forces that drive 
water level fluctuation and how 
this might affect fisheries in the 
area.

Additionally, Marsik’s team 

is aiming to help indigenous 
people in the region, includ-
ing federally recognized Native 
American tribes, adapt to the 
changing water levels.

“For the indigenous peoples of 

the Great Lakes, these issues are 
not simply related to economics, 
but also to tribal traditions and 
spirituality,” he wrote.

Activist Alan Haber and Frithjof Bergmann, professor of philosophy, discuss the culture of politics during the Vietnam War 
for the opening session of “Teach-In for Peace: 50th Anniversary of the First Anti-War Teach-In” in Angell Hall on Tuesday.

the CSG elections for a second 
year, after its ticket successful-
ly earned Public Policy senior 
Bobby Dishell the presidency 
and secured several legislative 
seats.

This year, LSA junior Cooper 

Charlton and LSA sophomore 
Steven Halperin are running 
for president and vice presi-
dent, respectively.

Charlton is currently the 

president 
of 
the 
Student-

Athlete Advisory Committee, 
and Halperin sits on the CSG 
assembly as an LSA representa-
tive.

LSA senior Annie Pidgeon, 

Make 
Michigan 
campaign 

chair, said in a February inter-
view with the Daily that the 
party aims to heavily involve 
the campus community in CSG 
affairs.

“We’re trying to hear as 

many different voices as pos-
sible in order to continue to 
be able to create such positive 
change on campus as we’ve 
done in the past,” Pidgeon said.

A major part of the Make 

Michigan platform is improv-
ing campus safety by launching 
a new safety mobile applica-
tion.

Make Michigan also wants 

to address diversity by revamp-
ing the current Race and Eth-
nicity 
Course 
Certification 

requirements. To further unify 
the student body, Make Michi-
gan aims to expand the Wol-
verine Support Network and 
further connect alumni with 
students abroad.

In the recent vice presi-

dential debate, Halperin dis-
cussed how his experiences 
with the Summer Bridge Pro-
gram — a program designed 
to give students from various 
backgrounds an earlier start on 
campus — inspired his drive for 
a unified campus.

“Our classroom was so unit-

ed, and so passionate that it 
really felt like family,” he said. 
“I want to bring a family sense 
to the campus. I believe that we 
can do this.”

Defend Affirmative 

Action Party

DAAP — the political branch 

of the affirmative action advo-
cacy group BAMN — will run 
LSA junior Keysha Wall and 

LSA sophomore Katie Ken-
nedy as its presidential and 
vice presidential candidates, 
respectively. The party aims 
to improve campus diversity 
by providing onsite admissions 
within Ann Arbor and Detroit.

Wall said DAAP will provide 

a space for students to speak 
openly about issues they have 
faced on campus.

“DAAP has provided a plat-

form for students like me and 
other students who want to 
mobilize to be able make real 
positive change on campus,” 
she said during the presidential 
debate.

During last week’s debate, 

Kennedy added that it is vital 
for the University to improve 
campus diversity.

“We have the responsibility 

to provide an opportunity for 
students to thrive socially and 
academically,” she said. “Affir-
mative Action has clearly put 
the minority enrollment rate 
severely at risk and the lack of 
diversity on campus is taking 
away from the value of our edu-
cation.”

people information about it can 
be very helpful,” he said. “I sub-
sequently participated in about 
20 different teach-ins on sev-
eral different subjects.”

Mayer also said that revis-

iting the teach-in and other 
similar protests is important in 
inspiring students to engage in 
activism now.

“I’d like to see more student 

engagement with more issues 
of our time,” he said. “I think 
that the sense that one has an 
obligation to society as a whole 

is weaker today. We have an 
obligation to help society deal 
with the problems it has.”

Tuesday’s event kicked off 

a weeklong celebration of the 
first teach-in. On Friday, a Diag 
rally will feature a speech by 
activist Tom Hayden, a former 
editor at the Daily, and a march 
to Angell Hall.

Gottschalk, a member of Jew-
ish Voice for Peace, an organiza-
tion promoting education about 
alleged human rights violations 
against Palestinians, said divest-
ment is not an anti-Semitic move-
ment.

“I assure you, supporting this 

organization is not anti-Semitic 
because it does not target the Jew-
ish people,” Gottschalk said. “It 
targets multi-national corpora-
tions that target human rights and 
Palestinians.”

LSA junior Inbar Lev, a member 

of Wolverines for Peace, a group 
of University students working to 
promote peace and mutual under-
standing about the Palestinian 
and Israeli conflict, spoke against 
the resolution.

“We invite CSG and all inter-

ested students to participate in 
dialogue opportunities,” Lev said. 
“We desire to be part of a solution 
towards peace. Our responsibil-

ity can only be assumed through 
mutual understanding, construc-
tive dialogue and the recognition 
of the rights of all people.”

LSA senior Marianna Yamamo-

to is a member of Human Rights 
Through Education, a student 
group dedicated to promoting 
awareness of human rights viola-
tions.

“When our University invests in 

these companies, we, as students 
and members of the University, 
are saying yes, these human rights 
abuses are okay; yes, these lives do 
not matter; and yes, profit is more 
important than human rights and 
human lives,” she said.

The resolution was sent to be 

approved by the resolutions com-
mittee. The assembly will vote on 
its ultimate approval at CSG’s meet-
ing next Tuesday evening in the 
Michigan Union’s Rogel Ballroom.

SAFE proposed a similar resolu-

tion to CSG last March, asking the 
University to divest from compa-
nies that the same set of companies.

After the resolution was first 

proposed to CSG, the assembly 

voted that a vote on the proposal 
be suspended indefinitely. The 
decision resulted in a sit-in in the 
CSG chambers. The next week, 
however, former CSG President 
Michael Proppe, who is a Busi-
ness graduate student, motioned 
for the assembly to reconsider the 
proposal. CSG ultimately voted 
not to pass the resolution in a 25-9 
vote with five abstentions.

The University has only com-

plied with divestment requests on 
two accounts in its history. The 
first case occurred in 1978 per 
request by the University’s Board 
of Regents that a committee look 
into the “serious moral or ethi-
cal questions” of the investments 
being made in South Africa during 
the era of apartheid.

In 1999, a request to divest from 

tobacco companies was made 
because of their immoral execu-
tion of advertising, producing and 
presenting health information. 
The proposal ultimately received 
approval.

otherwise.”

Jomaa said Kydd helped her 

to understand the difference 
between how people with anos-
mia and those without taste.

“Michelle Kydd said that 

people with anosmia can taste 

sweet and sour and bitter and 
all of that kind of stuff,” Jomaa 
said. “But they can’t get the 
combination that the smell 
gives them, which is flavor. 
She compares it to eating food 
while having a cold.”

Both said they wished that 

congenital anosmia was a bet-
ter-known condition, and that 
people who had it knew there 

were more people affected by 
it as well.

“A blind person, or a deaf 

person, you can usually tell 
when you interact with them 
that they have this,” Riedel 
said. “But a lot of my friends 
don’t even know that I don’t 
have a sense of smell.”

“D

o not go where the path 
may lead, go instead 
where there is no path 

and leave a trail.” 
— Ralph Waldo 
Emerson

“We’re 
going 

to go around the 
room and intro-
duce 
ourselves 

now. Please tell us 
your name, major, 
year, where you’re 
from 
and 
your 

favorite 
 
 
 
 
 
 
.”

So 
begins 

approximately 
every 
class 
on 
campus. 
Let’s 

face it, the introduction class is 
brutal. How many people actually 
remember what their peers say at 
this time? I mean, I know I’m not 
the first to sarcastically think, will 
this be on the test? and then fade 
off into space as the introductions 
start.

Sometimes I perk up when I hear 

the exotic locations rattled off: 
Istanbul, Seoul, Hong Kong. The 
familiar twinge of wanderlust pulls 
me out of my thoughts even while 
it simultaneously sends me back 
down the rabbit hole.

For as long as I can remember, I 

have nearly always chosen the road 
less traveled. In fact, I’m rather sure 
I am a secret part of some “Road 
Less Traveled Adopt-A-Highway” 
program 
that 
was 
unwittingly 

assigned to me from some long for-
gotten suburban research program.

At 35 years old, I have seen and 

done a lot. But when I’m asked, 
“Where are you from?” my first 
thought isn’t Taylor, Michigan 
(which is technically the first city I 
was brought home to). Nor is it Red-
ford, where I lived through my K-12 
years. In fact, it’s not even in any of 
the first three states I lived in. No, 
the answer to that question is Clin-
ton, Connecticut, a place I never 
stepped foot in until I was already 
well into my 20s.

Clinton. For some, the name 

evokes scorn, blue dresses or even 
NAFTA. Yet for me, it evokes Stop-
N-Shop. More specifically, it makes 
me recall my horrible job stocking 
shelves on the night crew at that 
specific grocery store. You want to 
talk about effective interrogation 
techniques, put someone that loves 

to travel and see new places into 
that environment for three years, 
sit back and reach for the tape 
recorder. The crazy comes out fast. 
Overnights at a grocery store are 
the land where dreams go to die.

According to Bill, dreams died 

during the day there, too. Bill was 
the seafood manager at Stop-N-
Shop, and one of the most miser-
able people I have ever met. He was 
a mixture of the character Andy 
from “The 40 Year Old Virgin,” 
Walt Whitman and Darth Vader, all 
rolled into one big, depressed, base-
ment-dwelling 20-something. Bill 
is also the reason I have direction in 
my life, and so this story is for him.

Bill loved to hike. If you have 

never been to Connecticut, here’s 
a quick run-down of what it’s like 
(at least along Route 1): cozy, old 
architecture, 
snooty 
people 

and trees. The 
“servant” class 
(i.e. 
those 
of 

us working the 
non-finance 
jobs) is looked 
down upon. As 
such, there is 
a 
stark 
class 

divide 
among 

the populace. Bill and I belonged 
firmly on the “poor” side — he lived 
with his mom; I lived in a motel.

Being poor, we found a lot of 

ways to stretch our entertainment 
dollar. One of our favorite activities 
was hiking in the parks around the 
area (there are a lot of parks to hike 
in Connecticut). In particular, Bill 
enjoyed leaving the marked paths 
and finding places we could smoke. 
Being the “follow the rules” type, at 
first I balked at this. Bill was persis-
tent, though, and so off we went.

Usually, we ended up at some 

outcrop of rock overlooking a small 
valley, or the bank of a river where 
we could watch the osprey hunt. Bill 
called it “blazing a path” (he was 
into ironic subtleties), and while 
it was frowned upon, the dozens 
of geocaches we found were more 
than enough proof that we weren’t 
alone in our endeavors. If that gro-
cery store was where dreams went 
to die, then those forests are where 
dreams cruelly returned.

During these sojourns, Bill would 

always take the lead, blazing a path 

to our next smoke stop. This gave 
me a unique perspective, some-
thing that stuck with me without 
even knowing: ahead of us lay noth-
ing but untouched woods, with no 
sense of direction, no road, no guid-
ance. Behind us, you could clearly 
see where we had come from — the 
clump of wild flowers we walked 
around, the river we jumped, the 
place we stopped to enjoy a quick 
break. While the individual steps, 
the “drudgery,” were impercepti-
ble, the path itself was distinct.

And that’s how I find myself 

here, the unofficial “Second-Oldest 
Undergrad” on campus, on my sec-
ond or third attempt at a degree. 
Looking forward, I have no idea 
what’s going on — I see nothing but 
trees and fog. Behind me, you can 
see the camp Bill and I made when 

we 
moved 
to 

Hawaii. You can 
clearly see the 
puddle I jumped 
to 
get 
back 

to 
Michigan, 

stranding Bill on 
that rock. Before 
that, you can see 
where I got mar-
ried, 
and 
just 

over this last hill 

is where I had my son. Over there, 
you can see how obvious the path 
from karaoke host to astrophysi-
cist to political scientist seamlessly 
flows. Even though you can’t always 
see it, that trail exists for all of us.

The next time you encounter that 

“Stay on the Path!” sign, do a quick 
check for poison ivy and guards, 
and then confidently take that hard 
left directly into the unknown.

In life, there’s only one path that 

matters, and that’s the one you 
make for yourself. Own it and enjoy 
it, because it will all make sense 
later, when you turn around to 
catch your breath. It doesn’t matter 
if your parents, your professors or 
even your best friend don’t under-
stand why switching majors from 
civil engineering to art history is 
obviously the right move. It’s your 
trail to blaze, not theirs.

And seriously, even though you 

can’t stand being around me any-
more, thanks Bill.

We deserve better

I believe in the University of 

Michigan.

I have confidence in the fresh 

leadership of University President 
Mark Schlissel and the administra-
tion of the University, and — most 
of all — Jim Harbaugh. I believe in 
the 19 exceptional schools and col-
leges this University houses and 
the diverse perspectives from pro-
fessors who work daily to create a 
better generation of Michigan Wol-
verines. I believe in each and every 
one of my fellow Wolverines; 43,625 
students call Ann Arbor their 
home, and I’m proud to call them 
my Michigan family.

I believe in the passion of leaders 

in the 1,375 clubs this University 
offers. I believe in the abilities of the 
governing bodies of each University 
school and college. I believe in the 
power of the student’s voice on this 
campus, and the idea of tangible 
changes being made by passionate, 
dedicated student representatives. 
I believe in the freedom to discuss 
the ideas that flourish with intellec-
tual diversity.

I am Greek. I firmly believe in 

Greek life and the benefits it provides 
to the University and the community.

The University of Michigan is truly 

a prodigious and nonpareil institu-
tion, and the students who work to 
represent this University at the level 
it deserves are truly unbelievable in 
regards to their service, leadership 
and exceptional work ethic.

The students in the University’s 

chapter of Sigma Alpha Mu did not 
represent the reputation of this Uni-
versity and Greek life at the level 
it deserves: they tarnished it. We 
deserve better.

The University is moving past that 

ski trip weekend, Sigma Alpha Mu’s 
International Headquarters is mov-
ing past that weekend, and now the 
Central Student Government should 
move past that weekend. It’s con-
cerning that a potemtial bystander 
of this incident may become elected 
as the vice president of CSG. We 
deserve better.

I have difficulty believing in the 

leadership of a person, who would be 
representing 43,625 students of this 
campus, when he was present at the 
disastrous Treetops Resort ski week-
end. As this damaging news spread 
across thousands of televisions, 
smartphones and computers around 
the country, it tarnished the brand of 

the University and caused parents to 
call their students with questions as 
to whether or not they knew the indi-
viduals responsible for this destruc-
tion. We deserve better.

I have difficulty believing in the 

leadership of a person who inconsis-
tently says he cannot be judged on 
the actions of his fraternity brothers, 
while also boasting about his position 
as rush chair of his fraternity for two 
semesters, thus potentially recruit-
ing the members who destroyed the 
ski resort. We deserve better.

I’m not here to judge whether or not 

CSG vice presidential candidate Matt 
Fidel participated in these events, to 
shed him in a negative light or dis-
pute his qualifications: he is a fellow 
Wolverine. I’m writing because the 
University community needs to move 
past the issues arising from the ski trip 
fiasco. We deserve better.

The CSG vice president should 

exemplify the high University stan-
dard and reputation of being the lead-
ers and best. The University needs to 
move forward. If “The Team” is more 
important than the University, count 
me out, because we deserve better.

The joys of trailblazing

ERIC 
KUKIELKA

Holding onto love

T

echnology has gotten in the way of 
many of our opportunities to create 
stronger relationships with people 

in our lives. We look at our 
phones rather than at eyes, 
we e-mail rather than call, 
we search Instagram rather 
than asking about a friend’s 
vacation. Yes, maybe tech-
nology and social media are 
playing a hand in destroy-
ing the art of conversation, 
maintained attention and 
genuine interaction.

But technology also sup-

plies a forum for relation-
ships to continue despite 
physical distance. Maybe this causes more pain 
and elongates relationships that could have 
ended sooner, or maybe it provides real oppor-
tunities in ways that weren’t possible before.

The truth is that it’s damn hard to find a 

partner in this world who 
is truly compatible with 
your personal vibe. The 
main 
message 
behind 

many works of art, books 
and movies is that love is 
incredibly difficult to find 
and maintain, and it’s also 
one of the best feelings in 
the world. While there 
are many fish in the sea, 
not that many fish seem to 
swim in your current.

Finding love is often a matter of sheer dumb 

luck (five points for Gryffindor).

The increased possibility of long-distance 

relationships by means of technology gives us 
the power to explore more connections in our 

lives and stay linked to the people we find who 
really work, rather than settling for what is in 
our general proximity.

Of course, it would be better and less pain-

ful to find someone who lives next door, but life 
doesn’t always work so seamlessly. If you find 
someone who fits in your puzzle, hang onto 
him or her. It’s not as common as it may seem.

If things work after months or even years of 

distance, you will find a way to bridge the gap 
and make the distance disappear. Sometimes 
what we need is time to figure out how to be 
with someone when they’re miles away.

Love is damn hard to find. Tinder can help, 

but only so much. It’s a mix of effort and sheer 
dumb luck. The luck is so dumb you better 
hold onto that person you love even if that 
means communicating only through Skype, 
texts and calls.

The technology age may have created a 

flakey hookup culture and an eye-contact-
free texting community, but it has also made 

great strides in the ways of 
love. Texts and Snapchats 
are not nearly as roman-
tic as handwritten letters 
delivered by horseback 
courier every other week 
like in “Pride and Preju-
dice,” but they can help 
maintain a relationship 
pretty effectively. Keep 
writing letters, but also 
take a Snapchat or two. 
Send a couple texts a day. 

Skype when you can. When dumb luck knocks 
on your door, use what you can to hold onto it.

MARIS
HARMON

In the winter of 2005, I was a 20-year-old 

undergraduate at the University. At that time, 
there was frustration fizzling on campus 
with regards to the relations between the 
University and the Coca-Cola Company.

At that time, I was a member of the Daily’s 

Editorial Board and, as its token Coke-loving 
southerner, advocated the minority view on 
behalf of the corporation. I write this letter in 
retraction of 20-year-old me.

Then, I was engrossed in courses on topics 

such as the political economy and game 
theory. I participated in libertarian summer 
programs in both Washington D.C. and 
Hong Kong, which spilled over into graduate 
studies that emphasized economics.

Now, I litigate cases nationwide on behalf 

of aggrieved employees, primarily under the 
Fair Labor Standards Act. Go figure.

This retraction is made not only so that 

Ican clear the air on a personal matter of 
substance but because I hope it will help you 
see that the learning and self-exploration that 
you currently experience needs to continue 
once you graduate.

Among my 20-self’s claims, I wrote:
“(H)earing first-hand accounts from the 

people of Colombia and India has compelled 
me to believe that at some level, the Coca-Cola 
company is in violation of the University’s 
labor 
standards 
condition. 
Nonetheless, 

the University should renew the company’s 
contract when the issue comes up in June.”

And:
“If the University actually followed through 

with its labor standards policy, it would have a 
very difficult time doing business with anyone.”

For reasons many of you may explore 

during LSAT preparations, these statements 
are flawed because they rely on glaring 
assumptions. First, they assume that if Coke 
and Pepsi’s labor standards suck, (most) 
everyone else’s do too. Even if this first 
assumption were true, they also assume that 
if the University has a “difficult time doing 
business with anyone,” it should ignore 
violations of its rules and regulations.

Historically, the Department of Labor has 

found that, at any given time, just 40 percent 
of employers are fully compliant with the 
FLSA. Some estimates suggest this number 
is much, much lower. Nonetheless, there are 
many other compliant employers.

And, even if the number was one percent 

— in terms of labor-sensitive beverage 
companies or employers — I would still 

retract my statements. Enforcement, whether 
it be from an active academic community or 
a governmental body like the Department 
of Labor, is important to check harms that 
cannot be resolved by “market forces.”

Additionally, I wrote:
“At some level, exploitation needs to occur 

in other countries. If U.S. companies are not 
able to take advantage of cheaper costs in other 
countries, the United States would have no 
incentive to provide its goods to the rest of the 
world, and many countries — India, China, 
Japan, etc. — would lack the American capital 
that has allowed their economies to grow during 
the last decades. This is not to say that companies 
shouldn’t be held accountable. This is to say 
though that the University’s business should not 
be conditioned on labor practices.”

Prior to Upton Sinclair’s “The Jungle,” the 

thought that we needed sanitation laws to 
deter companies from exposing our stomachs 
to spoiled meat was somewhere between 
radical and unpopular. While certain meat 
packers could have voluntarily chosen to 
adopt better practices, it took Sinclair’s story 
to humanize the issue such that top-down 
change had to occur.

I commend my peers for at least attempting 

to humanize the harms that it seemed Coke 
was, at a minimum, tolerating.

Following graduation, my closest group 

of friends went on a backpacking trip to 
Europe where they set off for three weeks 
and hit up most of the hot spots courtesy of 
Ryanair. Perceiving that I was too cool or, 
really just wanting to put off graduate school, 
I sold my car and travelled throughout 
South America with a buddy who had also 
grown up among privilege. It was amid 
these immediate post-graduation months of 
sleeping on buses and passing through dollar-
a-day communities that I began to consider 
the other side of certain arguments. Most 
germane, were these communities to evolve 
into, say, $2-a-day communities, local lives 
would be tangibly better and the incentive to 
rely on the communities for exports would 
 

likely persist.

Perhaps most significantly, it was on these 

trips that I committed myself to retain the 
interest in learning and exploration that I 
developed in Ann Arbor. Whatever you do, 
don’t be afraid to change. And, wherever you 
go, Go Blue!

“Cheers to better fashion choices #2k15.”

Season four closes 
flawed characters’ 

shenanigans

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Even after four seasons, it’s 

not easy to pinpoint why “Girls” 
has 
become 

such a cultural 
phenomenon. 
It 
isn’t 
the 

only show to 
feature female 
protagonists 
or 
young 

20-some-
things 
figur-

ing out how to 
be adults. It’s not even the only 
combination of the two (though 
it may be the most intelligent). 
What “Girls” understands and 
portrays – despite the occasion-
al haphazard character arcs 
and the unrealistically deca-
dent beauty of New York City 
– is that when people grow and 
learn from their mistakes, they 
don’t know that they are doing 
so, even if they believe they are 
fully self-aware.

“Home Birth,” the season 

four finale, encapsulates this 
point. The episode is the per-
fect ending to a witty, lovable, if 
at times faulty season. It leaves 
each of our four girls on the 
edge of something new, having 
learned from some mistakes 
and stubbornly holding onto 
others — but finding they’re all 
capable of womaning up and 
taking charge of their own lives.

The episode’s literal title 

comes from Adam’s (Adam 
Driver, 
“What 
If”) 
sister’s 

decision to home-birth her 
baby. Hannah (Lena Dunham, 
“Happy 
Christmas”), 
trying 

not to stare at Caroline’s naked 
swollen body floating in the 
bathtub, attempts to gently con-
vince her that one cannot “self-
doula.” She is joined by Adam, 
spectacularly inarticulate in 
his disbelief, and Jessa (Jemi-
ma Kirke, “Tiny Furniture”), 
who takes one look at the situ-
ation, another look underwater 
at Caroline’s vagina and then 
instructs everyone to grow up 
and get Caroline to a hospital. 
Though this is the only time 
Jessa has been the voice of rea-
son, it’s enough for her to decide 
by the end of the episode she’s 

going to be a therapist. (Wheth-
er this is appropriately Jessa-
like behavior or just hastily 
written character development, 
viewers will have to decide for 
themselves).

Shoshanna (Zosia Mamet, 

“The Kids Are Alright”) is also 
on the brink of a career change 
as she holds a job offer in Japan. 
As always, Shosh brings out 
the protective side of her audi-
ence — we can’t help but grit 
our teeth as the guy she’s see-
ing urges her not to take the job 
because, “(he’s) going to be in 
love with (her) real soon.” The 
choice in front of her reflects 
the same struggle emphasized 
by numerous Sheryl Sandberg 
references in the episode: lean 
in. Japan is far. New jobs are 
scary. The prospect of love is 
tempting and everyone knows 
it sometimes requires sacrific-
es, so we hold our breath as we 
wait for Shosh to decide if she’ll 
make this one. However, when 
she accepts the job, she reminds 
us she doesn’t need our protec-
tion or anyone else’s. Shoshan-
na is solidifying; she’s learning 
to take up her own space, and 
it’s about time.

Marnie (Allison Williams, 

“Peter Pan Live”) is learning, 
too, though she has admittedly 
always behaved as if the space 
she occupies were inherently 
better for it. Williams gives 
a nuanced performance in a 
scene where Marnie is crying, 
as she tilts her head up all the 
way back and lightly presses 
her manicured fingertips to the 
insides of her eyes. It’s a trick 
to keep tears from messing up 
make-up, which of course Mar-
nie would have perfected. Even 
when she’s losing it, she has to 
keep herself together. Williams 
evokes enough realistic vulner-
ability amidst the eye-roll-wor-
thy drama to make it impossible 
to dislike the delicate yet defi-
ant Marnie completely.

As it must, the finale finishes 

with its tragicomically flawed 
heroine. We aren’t unused to 
seeing Hannah choosing to do 
the right thing for herself; we 
see her do it all the time. She’s 
very, very good at unabashedly 
putting herself first when she 
needs to do so. But the simple, 
subtle scene wherein Adam and 
Hannah are facing each other 
in the NICU over Adam’s new 
niece — Jessa-Hannah Bluebell 
Poem Schlesinger Sackler — is 

the first time we see her doing 
so without needing to justify it 
to everyone she knows. When 
Adam hints to Hannah that they 
should get back together, Dun-
ham conveys how it’s difficult for 
Hannah to turn him down, but 
also how it was the only respon-
sible decision she could make. 
For the first time, Hannah makes 
a mature decision without feel-
ing the need to proclaim it.

The general vivacity of “Girls” 

is poignantly expressed through-
out all 32 minutes of “Home 
Birth,” except the last one, fea-
turing a six-month flashforward 
in which Hannah and Fran 
(Jake Lacy, “Obvious Child”) 
are shown together as a happy 
couple. Throughout the season, 
there wasn’t enough positive 
development in that relationship 
for us to believe that the two 
would actually work together 
(or maybe we just want to see 
Hannah end up with someone 
who has at least the potential 
for a personality). But the rest of 
the episode is truthful enough 
for us to forgive a suspiciously 
“happily ever after” ending that 
doesn’t fit in with the overall 
tone. Jessa, Shoshanna, Mar-
nie and Hannah may not all 
be where they want to be, but 
they’ve proven — to themselves 
and to us — that they are capa-
ble of making choices that they 
don’t feel the need to explain or 
defend, and that they’re ready 
to do it again.

Sure, “Girls” has its prob-

lems, just like its characters 
and just like its writers. But 
they do not detract from the 
worth of the show; if anything, 
their imperfections make it that 
much more authentic. Dunham, 
unlike Hannah, is all too aware 
of what many people think of 
her branding herself as the 
voice of this generation, but she 
knows her own talent doesn’t 
shy away from using it. She’s 
using her voice, whether it’s the 
voice of this generation or sim-
ply one of many, to create some-
thing nuanced, something witty 
— something good. Hannah’s 
final words of the episode seem 
to be coming not from a charac-
ter but Dunham herself, a nod 
to all the young 20-somethings 
who are watching, desperately 
trying to glean whatever useful 
worldly wisdom they possibly 
can: “Life, man. I can’t guaran-
tee perfection, but I can guar-
antee intrigue.”

Season 4 
Finale

Trendy undead show

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

It’s pretty clear to any casual 

observer that TV has an obsession 
with zombies. In recent years the 
fascination with 
the 
shuffling, 

decaying corps-
es has exploded 
with 
shows 

like 
AMC’s 

“The 
Walking 

Dead,” 
SyFy’s 

“Z Nation” and 
BBC’s “In the 
Flesh,” 
bring-

ing the flesh-
devouring monsters to viewers 
each week. There are multiple rea-
sons why viewers have remained 
fascinated with the creatures 
initially made popular years ago 
by the likes of George Romero. 
There’s obviously the primal love 
for blood and gore that tempts peo-
ple but also the ability to imbue the 
show with social and moral com-
mentary. With their new dramedy, 
“iZombie,” creators Rob Thomas 
and Diana Ruggiero (the creator 
and a writer, respectively, for 
“Veronica Mars”), look to extend 
the undead metaphor to finding 
one’s identity after tragedy.

The show’s protagonist, Olivia 

“Liv” Moore (Rose McIver, “Mas-
ters of Sex”) is a hardworking 
go-getter pursuing her residency 
at the local hospital with a seem-
ingly perfect life and fiancé, Major 
(Robert Buckley, “One Tree Hill”). 
However, after a boating party 
zombie attack (an entertaining and 
absurd set piece), Liv finds herself 
a newly dead zombie. Her brunette 
hair gives way to stark white locks 
and her skin turns ghostly pale. But 
unlike most zombies, Liv keeps her 
memories and self-control intact. 
To her family, she’s just a person 
who is going through a phase – a 
self-destructive one at that.

It’s not only the physical chang-

es that have caused Liv the most 
trouble, but the psychological and 
emotional crises that follow. After 
the boating party, Liv has lost all 

semblance of who she once was. 
Who she is has been radically 
changed, and dealing with that 
change isn’t easy. Liv has lost all 
ambition – giving up her prime 
residency and now working in 
a morgue, she’s broken up with 
Major and struggles to sleep. Liv 
is dead to the world in more ways 
than one now. She struggles with 
depression, unable to adjust fully 
to the ironic life of being dead. 
Having Liv as a zombie allows 
Thomas and Ruggiero to explore 
the directionless and trapping 
nature of trauma and depression 
in a somewhat literal form as Liv 
says, “I have no idea who I am any-
more.” However, an over-reliance 
on voiceover is overly expository 
even while it helps develop Liv’s 
character.

It’s uncovering a purpose that 

allows Liv to find life – figuratively 
speaking. This purpose lies in 
helping Detective Clive Babineaux 
(Malcolm Goodwin, “Breakout 
Kings”) and the Jane Doe that 
happens to come into the morgue 
Olivia works in with Dr. Ravi 
Chakrabarti (Rahul Kohli, “East-
Enders”). Liv’s need to eat brains 
allows her to get a peek into the 
memories of her latest meal along 
with acquiring the occasional skill 
and personality trait. Liv finds sup-

port in Ravi who geeks at helping a 
zombie, but he also provides a nec-
essary confidante for Liv’s strug-
gles. While Babineaux presents 
Liv a chance to find her place in the 
world by allowing her to help the 
detective solve his case under the 
guise of a psychic (a clever dig at 
the numerous fake psychic shows). 
McIver works well with both of 
her costars, creating an initially 
strong rapport especially with 
Goodwin. After Babineaux dis-
cusses his overly pragmatic zom-
bie apocalypse survival strategy, 
Liv comments, “Chivalry is dead,” 
and he retorts, “But Clive is alive.”

With new support and pur-

pose, Liv is ready for life in 
death. She discovers herself pos-
sessing abilities and strengths 
that she never knew existed 
while finding “a reason for being 
not alive.” It’s in this well-devel-
oped sentiment that “iZombie” 
presents its greatest promise. 
There are some missteps with 
over-narration and cell-shaded 
transitions that try too hard 
to remind the viewer that the 
series is based off a comic book. 
However, the clever comparison 
of Liv’s undead struggles with 
real-life issues forms a core con-
cept with plenty of opportunity 
for the future.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

On Feb. 22, Patricia Arquette 

won an Academy Award for her 
supporting role in “Boyhood.” 
On March 4, her new series 
“CSI: Cyber” premiered on CBS.

She 
may 

not be the 
first 
actor 

with 
Oscar 

credit 
to 

topline 
a 
crime 

procedural 
franchise 
— 
Forest 

Whitaker in 
“Criminal 
Minds: 
Suspect Behavior,” Terrence 
Howard in “Law & Order: Los 
Angeles” and Elizabeth Shue in 
the “CSI” mothership, to name 
a few — but Arquette’s journey 
from Academy-darling to Jerry 
Bruckheimer’s leading lady is 
certainly the most intriguing. 
When the news broke that 
Arquette would star in the 
latest “CSI” spinoff on March 5 
of last year, “Boyhood” was still 
a largely untested, 12-years-in-
the-making experiment. And 
with no way to predict that 
the film would become her 
breakout film role at the age of 
46, Arquette’s potential return 
to network television seemed 
like exactly the right move.

Let’s just say, a lot can 

change in a year.

As we all know, “Boyhood” 

became one of the year’s biggest 
success 
stories, 
Arquette 

especially singled out for her 
role as Olivia Evans. TIME 
Magazine 
even 
declared: 

“Forget The Boy” — “With 
just a few alterations, Richard 
Linklater’s 
‘Boyhood’ 
could 

just as easily have been called 
‘Motherhood.’ ” In the end, 
Arquette not only won the 
Academy Award, but also the 
Golden Globe, the SAG Award 
and 
countless 
others. 
But 

unlike most awards season 
victors, for whom their next 
project is a source of much 
intrigue and chatter among the 
press, Arquette had already 
wrapped filming on her latest 
series. Less than two weeks 
after 
her 
groundbreaking 

and controversial acceptance 
speech calling for equal pay, 
the actress made her debut 
as Special Agent Avery Ryan, 
officially trading in Sundance 
for CBS. Ethan Hawke for 
James Van Der Beek. An Oscar-
winning role for cyber sex with 
a chat-bot named Kitty.

If a “CSI” spinoff is already 

the lowest rung of the network 
television ladder, consider “CSI: 
Cyber” ’s feet planted firmly 
on the ground — an offensively 
terrible entry into the lucrative 
franchise, one that could only 

feasibly satisfy snarky bloggers 
or dozing grandparents. In the 
two episodes since its debut, 
Arquette and her team — also 
consisting of Shad “Bow Wow” 
Moss 
— 
have 
investigated 

online baby auctions and gore 
porn forums, twice-initiated 
online sex (“The more you pet 
me, the more I purr”), swabbed 
an infant’s dirty diaper for 
fingerprints and used a ham 
sandwich to explain computer 
technology. Even more so than 
the many “CSI” ’s or “NCIS” ’s 
that came before it, “Cyber” ’s 
character development is thin 
(Ryan was a victim of cyber 
crimes herself!). Its dialogue 
is laughable (“You work dark 
alleys, I work the dark web.”) 
and its be safe online mantra 
typed with quite the heavy 
hand. (It can, and most likely 
will, happen to you.)

It’s sad to see “CSI: Cyber” 

fail so spectacularly, not only 
given Arquette’s recent success, 
but also her history with this 
particular genre. As Allison 
Dubois on “Medium,” one of 
the greatest procedurals of all 
time, Arquette played a family 
woman with a supernatural 
gift, one that she used to solve 
crimes for the Phoenix District 
Attorney’s 
Office. 
Whereas 

“Cyber” is decidedly all crime, 
no character, “Medium” was a 
delicate balancing act — there 
was more to the NBC series 
than chasing clues and catching 
bad guys.

At its center was the Dubois 

family, Allison and Joe (Jake 
Weber, “The Following”) — 
a strong, equal partnership 
reminiscent of (dare I say) 
Eric and Tami Taylor and their 
three daughters. The crimes 
were always of a secondary 
concern; they were important, 
of course, but informed a larger 
narrative goal that brought 
all 
of 
“Medium” 
’s 
pieces 

together. They weren’t random 
or 
meaningless 
or 
entirely 

forgotten week-to-week. Their 
consequences — on Allison, on 
her family, on her colleagues — 
lingered. As a result, “Medium” 
was 
multi-dimensional 
and 

fully realized, intended for a 
more loyal audience than the 
late-night “CSI” rerun crowd.

“Medium” and “CSI: Cyber” 

represent 
opposite 
ends 
of 

the 
procedural 
spectrum 
— 

one original, thoughtful and 
sincere, the other a franchise 
cash cow. In fact, “Medium” is 
almost impossible to define in 
so few words, at once a master 
of the family drama, the crime 
procedural and the supernatural 
thriller. Ultimately, it’s not the 
jump-in-anywhere kind of crime 
series that any “CSI” thrives on, 
but rather one that demands its 
audience’s dedication. And at its 
core, Arquette’s Emmy-winning 
performance guides “Medium” 
’s 
beauty, 
a 
narrative 
that 

accomplishes so much without 
spreading itself too thin.

“CSI: 
Cyber” 
is 
both 

“Boyhood” and “Medium” ’s 
foil. It’s experimental in no way. 
The stories span little time, 
emotions or growth. Character 
development is sacrificed for 
another trail that runs dry. And 
even with just one storyline, one

worse than cyber sex with Kitty.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

Underrated genre 
deserves closer 

listening

By CLAIRE WOOD

Daily Arts Writer

Bernstein is a rockstar.
It’s no lie. His rhythms, argu-

ably, jam harder than Zeppelin. 
Despite this, Bernstein’s ground-
breaking works, along with the 
rest of classical music in general, 
goes largely unnoticed by the col-
legiate community. As choruses 
of “I Don’t Fuck With You” and “0 
to 100” bump out of the stereos of 
every bar, all things classical slip 
under the radar like paper clips on 
a messy desk.

Classical works of decades past 

are some of the most intricate, cap-
tivating overlaps of sound in exis-
tence. The drum claps of Mahler’s 
“The Titan” beat more bass than 
any R&B hit, and the singing cello 
of Saint Saen’s “Swan” gives every-
body shivers. Tchaikovsky’s Violin 
Concerto in D Major beckons us 
with the intersection of passionate 
violin and orchestral accompani-
ment, and Bernstein’s “West Side 
Story” captivates audiences in a 
jazzy ensemble of snaps and thun-
derous brass.

But nobody jams out to classical. 

We don’t stride into bars demand-
ing four shots of whiskey and a 
swig of Gershwin. We dance to the 
unending arpeggiated saxophone 
of “GDFR” and drink to cheers of 
“my anaconda don’t.”

Now here’s the question: why 

the obsession with pop? Why is 

classical music so off the radar? 
How does Katy Perry’s “Last Fri-
day Night” music video rake in 
over 455 million views while the 
online recording of Beethoven’s 
5th Symphony barely reaches the 2 
million marker?

Let’s take a look at one of my 

personal favorite music groups: 
2Cellos. Two strapping men, com-
plete with leather jackets and an 
Abercrombie gaze, gripping two 
glimmering black instruments. 
It’s Luca Sulic and Stejpan Haus-
er, posed on their album cover in 
a sharp combination of intellect 
and audacity that has girls check-
ing out more than just the title. 
The 2Cellos duo boasts more than 
undeniable pulchritude: the two 
men are brilliant cellists. Combin-
ing classical and contemporary, 
the duo records covers of big-
time pop hits — “With or Without 
You,” for example, or my personal 
favorite, a killer arrangement of 
Michael Jackson’s “Smooth Crimi-
nal.” To cut to the chase: they rock. 
In their music video “Thunder-
struck,” it’s Angus Young-gone-
cello as the two stars redefine wild 
in a string-ripping, head-banging, 
bow-flying spree of classical-hard 

rock goodness. Their music video 
doesn’t quite hit Katy Perry’s 455 
million, but it rakes in a great deal 
more than YouTube’s Beethoven’s 
5th. The duo enthralls us not only 
with sound, but with a passion-
ate, impressive visual energy that 
attracts viewers and keeps them 
there. Enthusiasm is sexy, and 
they’ve got it.

Traditional classical perfor-

mances, on the other hand, take 
a 180 degree turn from the rivet-
ing swagger of 2Cellos. It’s formal 
to say the least: black tuxedos 
and shiny shoes, all summed up 
in austere elegance. The music is 
beautiful (indeed, the passion of 
Tchaikovsky is undeniable), albeit 
the presentation of such classi-
cal pieces is, ironically enough, 
quite dispassionate. In the face of 
break-dancing Jason Derulo and 
string-flinging Stejpan Hauser, it’s 
no real surprise that dark-clothed, 
little-movement symphonic per-
formances plateau at a low viewer 
count.

The fact is, music isn’t all ears. 

Enthusiastic, rock-out visuals can 
be just as captivating as what we 
hear, and — performance-wise, 
at least — classical music is a little 
stiff. Beyoncé wouldn’t rake in 
as many fans without irresistible 
stage presence and Michael Jack-
son wouldn’t be as renowned with-
out brilliant choreography. We 
have to wonder how vast a fan base 
classical artists like Bernstein and 
Tchaikovsky would collect if their 
works were performed with the 
vibrant spunk of 2Cellos. Sound 
may be what we dance to at frats 
and drink to in bars, but it isn’t the 
only aspect of music that sells.

Classical music 
can rock out, too

Rock-out visuals 

can captivate 
just as much as 
the music itself

It’s sad to see 
‘CSI: Cyber’ 
fail in such a 

spectacular way. 

The stories 

span little time, 

emotions or 

growth.

‘M’ prepares for Western

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

Facing off against inferior 
opponents 
happens 
fairly 
often 
when 
you’re 
the 
Michigan softball team. After 
a commanding 
series to open 
up 
Big 
Ten 
conference 
play, 
the 
fourth-ranked 
Wolverines 
return home to 
meet Western 
Michigan.
The 
game, 
originally 
scheduled 
for 
Tuesday 
afternoon, 
was delayed until Wednesday 
due to a cold-weather forecast.
In 
the 
pitcher’s 
circle, 
Western 
Michigan 
boasts 
a high earned-run average 
of 4.76, whereas Michigan’s 
pitchers have combined for a 
1.51 ERA, the fifth best in the 
nation. Though the starting 
pitcher will not be announced 
until game time, it will likely 
be either senior left-hander 
Haylie Wagner or sophomore 
right-hander 
Megan 
Betsa. 
Both pitchers were unforgiving 
against 
Ohio 
State 
last 
weekend.

Against 
the 
Buckeyes, 
Michigan won its first two games 
13-1, and followed it up Sunday 
with a powerful 20-0 victory.
The third pitcher for the 
Wolverines, 
senior 
Sara 
Driesenga, is still dealing with 
an injury. If the team pulls ahead, 
freshman 
right-hander 
Tera 
Blanco may also see time in the 
circle.
Like Driesenga, senior catcher 
Lauren Sweet awaits her return 
after an awkward slide against 
Kent State. Sweet is known to be 
a power hitter for Michigan, but 
her replacement has been stellar 
as well.
Freshman Aidan Falk stepped 
behind the plate and is proving 
why she got so much time as the 
designated hitter before Sweet’s 
injury. Last weekend, Falk hit 
two home runs and recorded six 
RBI, contributing immensely to 
the team’s offensive power.
Michigan 
and 
Western 
Michigan have seen one common 
foe. The Broncos began their 
season 
against 
then-No. 
16 
Arizona State, losing by a score 
of 6-0. The Wolverines have also 
seen the Sun Devils, matching up 
three times and getting the best 
of them twice.
Though the Wolverines will 
be a large favorite Wednesday 
afternoon, 
Michigan 
coach 
Carol Hutchins still expects 

her team to come out the gate 
flying.
But letdowns against inferior 
opponents have not been an issue 
this season. This past weekend 
against Ohio State, a far weaker 
team, Michigan continued to 
hammer in runs, dominating by a 
total score of 46-2 over the three 
games.
If the Wolverines (3-0 Big Ten, 
28-4 overall) continue to play 
the way they have recently, the 
Broncos (6-13) won’t present the 
biggest challenge.
“The game is the game,” 
Hutchins said. “It’s just like 
playing softball. The game never 
changes.”
The weekend series against 
Ohio State was also significant as 
Hutchins recorded her 1,400th 
win, but the team knows that 
there are more important things 
than records.
“We are just playing like we 
usually do,” said junior infielder 
Sierra Romero. “Hutchins is a 
great coach, and she deserves it 
all, but we don’t get caught up in 
anything like that.”
When it comes to playing lesser 
quality teams, Michigan has 
done it all. Before the Wolverines 
return to their Big Ten schedule, 
the theme of mercy rules, 1-2-3 
defensive innings and endless 
home runs will likely continue 
on Wednesday.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Growth evident in WNIT

By JACOB GASE 

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team’s 
tumultuous 
2014-15 
season, 
which 
saw 
NCAA Tournament hopes fizzle 
after a disappointing finish in 
conference play, is finally nearing 
its conclusion.
And 
despite 
falling 
short 
of their preseason goals, the 
Wolverines 
have 
committed 
themselves to a new cause: 
sending their trio of seniors 
— guard Shannon Smith and 
forwards Cyesha Goree and 
Nicole Elmblad — out on a high 
note with the program’s first-
ever WNIT championship.
After double-digit victories 
over 
Cleveland 
State 
and 
Toledo in the tournament’s first 
two rounds, Michigan seems 
determined to hang the first 
women’s basketball banner at 
Crisler Center. But its strong 
WNIT run — which resumes 
when 
the 
Wolverines 
face 
Missouri on Thursday in Ann 
Arbor — is just as important for 
the program’s future as it is for its 
beloved senior class.
“It’s great for our seniors to 
finish on a great note, but it’s 
also really important that our 
five freshmen continue to work 
and continue to improve,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico after the victory over 
Cleveland State.
Guard Katelynn Flaherty has 

been the only major freshman 
contributor all season, moving 
in and out of the starting lineup 
and working to overcome her 
inconsistencies. Now, in the 
postseason, lesser-used freshmen 
like forwards Jillian Dunston and 
Emoni Jackson have been given 
chances to display the results of 
their hard work in practice.
Before the postseason, both 
Dunston and Jackson only saw 
the floor for short periods when 
Barnes Arico wanted a short 
burst of energy. Both showed 
flashes of talent — especially 
when it came to playing off the 
glass — but both also let their 
high motors and inexperience get 
the best of them by committing 
fouls at a high rate.
But now, in the WNIT, the two 
have combined for nine points 
and nine rebounds in 38 total 
minutes. The Wolverines’ recent 
opponents haven’t quite met the 
lofty standard of competition 
set by Big Ten teams, but the 
freshmen 
have 
shown 
signs 
of hope for the future of the 
Michigan 
frontcourt 
without 
Elmblad and Goree.
“Our 
younger 
kids 
have 
stepped up,” Barnes Arico told 
WTKA 
Radio 
on 
Tuesday. 
“Practices have been tremendous, 
and we’re continuing to improve.”
It’s not just the younger 
players who are displaying signs 
of growth as the season draws 
to a close. The team as a whole is 
starting to right its past mistakes.

When Toledo cut a 19-point 
deficit to just 10 with 6:44 
remaining, and when Goree 
ended up on the bench in foul 
trouble, the game suddenly felt 
eerily similar to the Wolverines’ 
losses to Ohio State, Nebraska 
and Northwestern, in which the 
team held significant leads before 
inexplicably falling apart without 
Goree in the game.
Only this time, Michigan 
answered every Rocket run and 
held on for a 74-58 victory.
“It was pretty impressive, 
especially at (Toledo’s) place,” 
Barnes Arico said. “It was such 
a great environment, and they 
were making runs at us, and we 
knew they were going to make a 
run. And every time they did, our 
kids were able to make big plays. 
It was so great to see our growth 
and different people stepping up 
at different times.”
Playing in the WNIT, win 
or lose, was not the ending the 
Wolverines were hoping for 
when their season began in 
November.
But for players like Dunston, 
Jackson 
and 
junior 
guard 
Madison Ristovski — who stands 
to be a team leader next season 
and has caught fire down the 
stretch — the tournament has 
been a golden opportunity to step 
up and prove themselves.
And for Michigan, it’s one last 
chance to atone for this season’s 
failures and work toward a 
brighter future.

Wolverines defeat Bowling 
Green to win home opener

By BEN FIDELMAN

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan baseball team 
came out firing on all cylinders 
in its home opener on Tuesday 
night, 
cruising 
to an easy 
8-3 victory 
over Bowling Green. It was an 
important shift in momentum for 
the Wolverines, who struggled 
mightily last weekend in a three-
game sweep at Nebraska.
Right-hander 
Matt 
Ogden 
took 
the 
mound 
first 
for 
Michigan (0-3 Big Ten, 12-11 
overall) and got the afternoon 
off to a hot start. The redshirt 
junior retired the Falcons (0-3 
MAC, 5-14 overall) in order 
through the first two innings, 
giving his team an opportunity 
to jump ahead early.
Bowling Green was the first 
to put a run on the scoreboard, 
with Kory Brown slugging home 
a leadoff single in the third 
inning with a double down the 
left-field line. Ogden ended the 
inning with a strikeout and a 
check-swing groundout to third 
base.
Junior third baseman Jacob 
Cronenworth led off the bottom 
of the third with a single and a 
stolen base, eventually putting 
himself on second base with 
one out. Next up was Glines, 
who brought a .556 on-base 
percentage into the game and 
reached base on a walk. The two 
moved up on a wild pitch, which 
was followed by a run-scoring 
groundout 
from 
sophomore 
right fielder Carmen Benedetti. 
Junior left fielder Cody Bruder 
added another with a run-
scoring single to left field, giving 
Michigan the 2-1 advantage 
heading to the fourth.
The Falcons bounced back 

with a run their next time up 
to tie the game, but Wolverine 
right fielder Kevin White put the 
home team back on top, 3-2, with 
a solo home run to right field.
“Being able to fire on all 
cylinders is huge,” White said. 
“We’re a dangerous team when 
we’re doing that. I was just really 
relaxed up there today and just 
trying to have fun.”
In the top of the fifth inning, 
Michigan replaced Ogden with 
sophomore left-hander Brett 
Adcock, who has struggled 
early this season. The team’s 
opening day starter, Adcock is 
carrying a bloated 5.47 earned-
run average, which recently 
shot up after allowing six runs 
in 1.2 innings against Nebraska 
last weekend.
Adcock struck out the first 
Bowling Green hitter before 
allowing the next three to reach 
base, at which point Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich strolled to 
the mound and replaced him 
with right-hander Mac Lozer. 
The sophomore got the Falcons 

batter to line out to left field, 
where Bruder caught the ball 
and gunned it home to beat 
the runner tagging from third 
base — ending the bases-loaded 
threat.
It was quite the combined 
effort by the pitching staff in the 
game, with five Michigan arms 
taking the mound. Ogden got 
the win for his four innings of 
work, which was complemented 
by Adcock and Lozer, along 
with 
freshmen 
left-handers 
Oliver 
Jaskie 
and 
Michael 
Hendrickson.
“It’s good to see those guys 
compete, attack the strike zone 
and just show some toughness 
on the mound while responding 
well after a tough weekend 
where we gave up a bunch of 
runs,” Bakich said. 
Getting 
many 
arms 
to 
work against a sub-.500 team 
could prove to be key, as the 
Wolverines look to continue 
their rebound this weekend 
against another tough opponent 
in No. 20 Maryland.

Berenson plans to 
return next season

By ZACH SHAW 

Daily Sports Writer

When the Michigan hockey 
team takes the ice for its home 
opener next October, the fans at 
Yost Ice Arena will see a familiar 
face following the team to the 
bench.
Michigan coach Red Berenson 
announced Tuesday afternoon 
that he plans to return for the 
2015-16 season, as long as the 
Athletic Department will have 
him.
“Right now that’s the plan,” 
Berenson said. “I haven’t talked 
to our athletic director (Jim 
Hackett) and reevaluated our 
progress of the team or where 
we’re going, but that’s the plan.”
The decision comes three days 
after the Wolverines (12-8 Big Ten, 
22-15 overall) fell to Minnesota 
in the Big Ten Tournament 
championship game, 4-2. With 
the loss, Michigan failed to make 
the NCAA Tournament for the 
third consecutive season after 
qualifying for the previous 22 
years.
The season proved to be a 
lopsided one for Michigan, which 
was the nation’s top offense in 
goals per game, but ranked just 
38th out of 59 teams in defense. 
Just three days removed from 
the season-ending loss in Detroit, 
Berenson 
already 
sees 
the 
potential for next year.
“Offensively, the name of the 
game is to score goals, and we 
were one of the best teams in the 
country,” Berenson said. “On the 
defensive side, we were improved 
over last year, but not enough.
“I didn’t think our defense 
was as good as it should have 
been. We were inconsistent, I 
think we can do a better job as 
coaches, there’s lots of room or 
improvement. Maybe I’m a slow 
learner, but I still think we can 

do a better job with this team.”
A former All-American and 
NCAA scoring leader as a player 
for the Wolverines from 1960 to 
1962, Berenson, now 75 years 
old, became the first collegiate 
hockey player to go straight to 
the National Hockey League 
after scoring 43 goals in his 
senior season — still a Michigan 
record.
After 
a 
17-year 
playing 
career in which he tallied 658 
points in 987 games, Berenson 
immediately became the coach 
of the St. Louis Blues in 1979. He 
won the Jack Adams award as 
the NHL’s best coach in 1981, but 
took the Michigan head coach 
position in 1984, citing a love 
for Michigan as the reason for 
leaving the NHL.
In addition to 22 consecutive 
NCAA 
Tournament 
appearances, 
Berenson 
has 
coached Michigan to 11 Frozen 
Fours, national titles in 1996 
and 1998, and turned a dormant 

fan base into one of the most 
respected in the nation.
This season, Berenson became 
just the fourth coach in NCAA 
history to win 800 games, and 
kept his team within one game 
of both the Big Ten regular-
season and tournament titles. 
Regardless, fans and analysts 
have 
speculated 
that, 
with 
the recent lack of tournament 
appearances, if it might be time 
for Berenson to retire.
Unsurprisingly, those on the 
team find such talk ridiculous.
“I mean, you see all the 
trophies he’s won, and what 
he’s done for this program is 
unbelievable,” said sophomore 
forward JT Compher. “A lot 
of this stuff, and the reason 
why we’re talking (about job 
security) today, is on the players 
and because we left games out 
there that we should have won. 
Everyone in the locker room 
respects Red, and any talk is 
from the outside.”

Players mull their futures

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Editor

Red Berenson hates this time 
of year.
Specifically, he dislikes when 
the season ends and there is a 
period of time when he doesn’t 
know who, aside from the 
graduating seniors, will be gone 
next year.
At a program like Michigan, 
which brings in elite recruiting 
classes full of NHL draft picks 
every year, it’s expected that 
some players may not stay all 
four years.
“That’s the 
worst 
part 
of the end of 
the 
season,” 
Berenson 
said. “Players 
get all excited 
about it, and 
their families 
get all excited 
about 
it, 
and 
then 
sometimes 
they jump at it. Sometimes, 
common sense kicks in and they 
realize there is no rush.”
Last year, both Alex Guptill 
and Phil Di Giuseppe decided 
to forgo their senior years 
to join their respective NHL 
organizations. Two years ago, 
Jacob Trouba left after his 
freshman season to join the 
Winnipeg Jets.
This year, three Wolverines 
will have to make that same 
tough 
decision: 
freshman 
forward 
Dylan 
Larkin, 
freshman 
defenseman 
Zach 
Werenski and junior forward 
Andrew Copp.
Larkin, 
the 
Detroit 
Red 
Wings’ first-round draft pick in 
2014, just finished an impressive 
freshman campaign that earned 
him the Big Ten Freshman 
of the Year honor. He led all 
conference freshmen with 47 
points (15 goals and 32 assists) 

and finished second on the team 
in points, trailing only senior 
Zach Hyman.
Larkin could feasibly play 
games for the Red Wings this 
season, but would most likely 
join the Grand Rapids Griffins 
in the American Hockey League 
should he choose that route.
“The Red Wings have already 
opened the door for him to 
know that it’s up to him to stay 
in school or if he wants to play 
in Grand Rapids,” Berenson 
said.
Copp, the Wolverines’ captain 
and Winnipeg Jets draft pick, 
remained non-
committal on a 
return for next 
season. 
The 
junior finished 
third on the 
team 
points, 
registering 
31 
on 14 goals and 
17 assists.
It 
didn’t 
seem 
likely 
that he’d bolt 
after this season, but Berenson 
noted Winnipeg loves signing 
its players after their junior 
seasons, and it wouldn’t be any 
different for Copp.
“When you’re a junior and a 
good player like he is, they try 
to sign their juniors, whether 
they think you’re ready or not,” 
Berenson said. “They’ll tell you 
what you want to hear, and 
that’s the reality of it.”
Copp added that he “took 
a step this year” and feels 
“decent” 
about 
where 
he 
currently stands.
“I’m trying to figure out what 
is my best option for next year,” 
Copp said. “I’ll probably take 
another week to figure that out.
“It’s definitely a decision I 
have to make. I don’t think I’ll 
be getting any outside opinion. 
The people who matter to me 
most, I’ve already talked to.”
Werenski, though, is in a 

completely different situation. 
The 17-year old freshman is just 
now draft eligible, and many 
predict that he will be a top-10 
pick in the 2015 NHL Draft.
The 
freshman 
was 
arguably the Wolverines’ top 
defenseman, contributing nine 
goals and 16 assists, earning 
him a spot on the All-Big Ten 
First Team.
Unfortunately for Michigan, 
NHL 
organizations 
often 
want their top draft choice to 
enter their system as soon as 
possible. That means Werenski 
wouldn’t be wearing the maize 
and blue next season if the 
professional team that drafts 
him has its way.
“I think he will be in a bit of a 
tug of war with whoever drafts 
him,” Berenson said. “They 
might want him out. If I were 
him, I would just stay put for at 
least another year, keep growing 
my game, and I think he’s fine 
with that. But let’s see who 
drafts him and how aggressive 
they come after him.”
It’s feasible that Copp, Larkin 
and Werenski could all leave. 
It’s also possible that all of them 
could stay.
But according to Berenson, 
the decision is simple and can be 
boiled down to an analogy.
“It’s just like having a driver’s 
license,” Berenson said. “You 
know you’re going to get a 
license when you’re 16. But 
how about when you’re 14? Are 
you ready to take a Corvette to 
Chicago when you’re 14? I don’t 
think so. Now when you’re 16, 
you might think you are and you 
might be OK. But you’ll probably 
be better off when you’re 18 
or 19 or 20 to be trusted and 
confident and so on.
“It’s not that much different 
when all these people watch pro 
hockey on TV and think, ‘Well 
yeah, I can play there, I’m as 
good as that guy.’ They have no 
idea.”

“That’s the 
worst part of 
the end of the 
season.”

Cole makes strides at center

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

After starting 12 games at left 
tackle last season, sophomore 
Mason Cole has spent the last 
two weeks learning to play 
center.
With incumbent center Jack 
Miller leaving the team at the 
beginning of spring practice, 
and fifth-year senior Graham 
Glasgow 
suspended 
for 
a 
probation violation, Cole has 
been thrust into action in the 
middle of the offensive line.
And 
despite 
having 
no 
prior experience at center, a 
notoriously tricky position to 
perfect, Cole said Tuesday that 
he is enjoying the opportunity to 
learn its nuances.
“It’s different, but it’s good to 
learn something else,” Cole said. 
“It’s just a whole different game 
in the middle.”
During 
a 
practice 
last 
Thursday, Cole anchored a line 
that included redshirt juniors 
Ben Braden, Erik Magnuson and 
Kyle Kalis along with redshirt 
sophomore 
Logan 
Tuley-
Tillman.
He told reporters Tuesday 
that while there is a noticeable 
difference between playing on 
the outside and playing at center, 
offensive line coach Tim Drevno 

has helped make his immersion 
as smooth as possible.
Cole is still taking reps at left 
tackle as well, but with limited 
depth at center outside of redshirt 
sophomore Patrick Kugler, his 
growth in the middle could be a 
key for the Wolverines.
“The 
staff 
does 
a 
good 
job of making sure everyone 
knows everything, at least on 
the offensive line with Coach 
Drevno,” Cole said. “It’s a little 
different making center calls and 
stuff, but you’ve gotta know your 
stuff everywhere.
“It’s just a lot quicker. The 
guys are a lot bigger inside and 
everything is a lot closer. … 
Usually I play with leverage and 
do fine.”
One player who has gotten 
perhaps the best feel of Cole’s 
transition is sophomore defensive 
tackle Bryan Mone, who now 
weighs in at 330 pounds after 
putting on weight this offseason.
Mone is a lot to handle at the 
nose tackle position, even for an 
experienced center. But he says 
that Cole has already impressed 
the defensive line with his ability 
to transition.
“He’s doing a really good 
job. When we found out he was 
moving to center, me and (junior 
defensive tackle) Ryan Glasgow 
were just licking our lips.

“At first I thought he was 
going to slow up, but you can tell 
what kind of football player he is. 
Wherever you want him to play, 
he’s gonna play it with everything 
he has. He’s never going to quit. If 
he does mess up … he’s just going 
100 miles (per hour).”
Cole was the first ever true 
freshman to start a season 
opener on the offensive line, and 
coaches repeatedly touted his 
intelligence. That helps to explain 
why Drevno and Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh thought of Cole 
when the center position became 
a question mark.
But if they have to move him to 
the inside full time, a new starter 
will have to emerge elsewhere 
on the line. Whether that comes 
in the form of Tuley-Tillman, 
redshirt sophomore guard David 
Dawson or someone else, the 
line could see its fair share of 
shuffling between now and the 
season opener September 3 at 
Utah.
Still, Cole said he had full 
confidence in Drevno and the 
coaching staff to find the right fit.
“They don’t know all of us yet 
as much as the other staff did, so 
they’re trying different things 
and experimenting a little bit,” 
Cole said. “That’s what spring is 
about — just changing things up 
and competing.”

I

t’s easy to spot students 
from the University at any 
airport. Our flights to dif-

ferent locations awaken a need to 
let everyone know where exactly 
we go to school and where we 
belong.

So there I was, on the Wednes-

day evening of Spring Break, 
camped out at gate 42B tugging at 
my University sweatshirt, which 
students are wont to do, and grip-
ping my passport so tightly that 
my nails were beginning to make 
indents into the scratchy black 
cover.

The flight to India had been 

booked that day: my great-grand-
mother was sick. Really sick. I’ll 
spare you the details, but it had 
reached the point where if I didn’t 
see her soon, I might never see her 
again.

Listen, she is 92. Her passing, 

should it occur, wouldn’t be trag-
ic. The woman had lived through 
colonialism, a world war and 
three generations of her family — 
she’d seen more things and lived 
more life than anyone I’ve yet to 
know.

The problem — really, the rea-

son for my constant foot tapping 
and overall discomfort — was that 
this was my first time flying to 
India in four years and it would be 

my shortest trip yet.

Two days of flying to stay for 

three days, I remember thinking 
on both the flights there and back. 
I would be spending 40 percent 
of the rest of my Spring Break 
30,000 feet above the ground — 
both nowhere and everywhere.

The 

last time 
I 
was 

there 
I 

hated 
it. I was 
young 
and 
bored 
and 
igno-
rant, 
unwill-
ing 
to 

under-
stand 
why 
things 
and 
people 
were so 
different and extremely stubborn 
about changing my perspective 
on the issue. As far as I was con-
cerned, I didn’t fit in there, which 
was ironic, really, considering I 
was born in India.

I’d been making excuses for 

years to make sure I wouldn’t go 
back: “I have summer school.” 
“I can’t take time off of work.” “I 
have to make sure I’m ready for 
college.” But this trip was differ-
ent, mainly because I was differ-
ent.

I’m in a perpetual limbo, and 

the 
spontaneity 

of my trip back 
to India came at 
exactly the right 
time. A large chunk 
of my life right now 
is unplanned. I have 
no major, no dead-
set career plan, no 
clue what I’ll be 
doing 
tomorrow, 

today, or even five 
minutes from now.

Many 
people 

have a tunnel vision 
on where they want 
to go and what they 
want to do, but … I 

have nothing.

While I didn’t have any sort 

of bullshit spiritual awakening 
Hollywood movies will try to 
convince you you’ll have when 
you travel to a new country, I 
thought more about the conjunc-
tion between identification and 

options.

Stephen Hawking has stated 

time and time again, in basically 
every interview I’ve watched, that 
there exists the concept of an infi-
nite number of parallel universes. 
There exists a universe where I 
know what I want, what my major 
would be, and where my life would 
be headed.

On the Friday of Spring Break, 

I remember driving through a 
roadway near a college district. I 
was looking out the car window 
at packs of girls huddled around 
flower stalls and sitting in coffee 
shops and I wondered if I would 
be the same person I am right now 
if my parents had decided to stay 
in India.

I’d see a group of college girls 

headed home, walking home and 
joking with each other, and get 
nostalgic about a life I’ve never 
led.

Would I still prefer strawber-

ries sliced over my cereal? Would 
my caffeine dependency still 
exist? Would I still love writing as 
much as I do right now?

Would I have the same doubts 

and fears I do now?

I’d like to think that only frag-

ments of my personality would be 
different and that I, at my core, 
would remain the same no matter 
what country I grew up in. Maybe 
I would still be as lost and inse-
cure as I am right now.

Or maybe I’d have it all figured 

out.

From the Pews: Listening to TEDx sermons 

F

riday morning I woke 
early, walked to the 
Power Center and sat 

down in the large auditorium star-
ing up at a black, daunting stage. I 
waited with so many others to be 
enlightened by the speakers of the 
TEDxUofM “Constructive Inter-
ference” annual conference.

Maybe it was the masses of peo-

ple following each other blindly 
into the building, the tone in the 
voice of each TEDx staff member 
as they encouraged us to interact 
with our surrounding commu-
nity members, or the expectations 
each of us held that we were about 
to listen to something — no mat-
ter how small — that would alter 
our life. I couldn’t help but consis-
tently compare this experience to 
my early experiences of waking to 
sit and listen to a sermon from the 
pastor at our Methodist church.

Forgetting about my tiredness, 

I sat, eyes glued, to the well-versed, 
engaging speakers, holding the 
same expectations I have when I 
sit in church: expecting to learn 

something new, expecting to be 
challenged, expecting to be skep-
tical. The speakers repeatedly 
shared an experience, acknowl-
edged their mistakes (taking those 
mistakes as learning experiences 
and not failures), and offered some 
small piece of advice, constructive 
criticism of our society, or per-
spective on how to look at life.

TED is a nonprofit, nonparti-

san foundation that is dedicated to 
spreading ideas and information 
across the world through short, 
18-minute or less, talks. Begin-
ning in 1984, Richard Saul Wur-
man 
discovered 
that 
mixing 

technology, entertainment, and 
design 
into 
one 
conversation 

could produce innovative ideas. 
TED’s mission is to generate ideas 
that will impact the attitudes and 
lives of the people in the world; 
“building a clearinghouse of free 
knowledge from the world’s most 
inspired thinkers.”

Seeing as I took TEDx to be my 

own form of religion for the day, I 
only feel it fitting I share some of 

these insights.

Aditi 
Hardikar, 
the 
White 

House’s primary liaison to LGBT 
and Asian American and Pacific 
Islander communities, told me 
to reframe my disadvantages as 
advantages. That suffering from 
too many feelings of inadequacy 
can be a physiological disorder 
and something that we must com-
bat — can combat — by identifying 
what we know from what we don’t 
know.

Jill Halpern, a teacher at the 

University’s 
Comprehensive 

Studies Program, told me about 
how to nurture every part of my 
brain, even parts I’m not fully 
aware of. That love and human 
connection are the most impor-
tant skills to learn in any class-
room, even among a group of 
calculus students.

And Dory Gannes, founder of 

the nonprofit Olevolos Project, 
a nonprofit that funds scholar-
ships for children in Tanzania, 
told me not to change the world. 
That spending money in the right 

places can be chal-
lenging, that making 
sustainable change 
in a place like East 
Africa 
is 
almost 

impossible, 
that 

trusting people who 
later betray you can 
be one of the biggest 
mistakes. So instead 
of trying to move big 
rocks in the world, 
I should reconsider 
this 
dream 
and 

instead focus on bet-
tering the world in 
small ways, in ways 
that better myself.

In an age where 

the number of peo-
ple 
who 
affiliate 

with 
any 
religion 

is 
declining, 
I’m 

inspired by our soci-
ety’s dedication to 
organizations 
like 

TED. I can’t say I’m 
surprised 
though; 

listening 
to 
TED 

talks bettered me as 
an individual more 
than 
any 
sermon 

ever has.

Cost of the Experience: 

Students’ spending 

habits at the ‘U’

A 

recent survey conducted by The 
Michigan Daily examined the social 
spending habits of undergraduate 

students, looking at what people do for fun 
and how much they’re paying for it.

Whether going to the football or basket-

ball games, taking a road trip with friends 
over a break, or scheduling a weekly meet-
ing at a favorite bar, a variety of experiences 
were shown to shape a student’s love of 
their college experience.

As found in previous Daily surveys about 

the school, the University is largely com-
prised of students who come from more 
affluent socioeconomic backgrounds. Over 
half of respondents come from households 
earning at least $100,000.

Despite high family incomes, only 20 per-

cent receive their primary money for “fun” 
from their parents. A large majority, 73 per-
cent, earn their spending money themselves 
— with 37 percent making the money at an 
on or off-campus job and 36 percent saving 
money from previous jobs.

The data show a wide range of favorite 

activities and spending habits, but in the 
end, one thing is clear: a large majority of 
students are happy with their social lives at 
the University.

Out on the town
Drinking is a major social outlet for many 

students. Over a quarter of students go to a 
party at least once a week, with 12 percent 
of students going out to parties two to three 
times a week and 17 percent reporting just 
once a week. Around a fifth of campus, 21 
percent, goes to parties just two-to-three 
times a month. Twenty percent responded 
that they never go to parties.

Bars are less popular than parties, with 

15 percent going out once a week and only 
7 percent going out two to three times a 
week. About half of students responded that 
they never go out to bars. However, among 
upper-classmen, who are more likely to be 
of age to go out to bars, 21 percent go once a 
week and 13 percent go two-to-three times 
a week.

Public Policy senior Bobby Dishell, presi-

dent of Central Student Government, said 
he and his friends enjoy going out to bars 
and restaurants. Dishell has spent a great 
deal of his four years working with CSG but 
has also enjoyed the campus social life. He 
said what he most enjoys is having a large 
friendship circle, most of whom are frater-
nity brothers of his.

Dishell said he is fortunate enough to 

not have to worry much about being able to 
afford going out and that his friends tend to 
trade-off covering each other’s bills. While 
he said he and his friends were a “fiscally 
responsible” group, he added that he was a 
bit surprised by how quickly the expenses 
added up as he estimated his weekly spend-
ing.

“If people are going out two-to-three 

nights a week, you’re usually paying cover 
twice so that’s $10,” he said, counting the 
cost of bringing along a friend or signifi-
cant other. “Cabbing to-and-from is about 
two bucks a person. You call it two bucks a 
person each way, three nights — that’s $22. 

I mean, it’s warmer out, people are walking 
more, but call it twenty bucks a week before 
you even walk in the door.”

On average, students spend about $39 per 

week on smaller social expenses. Going out 
to eat is the largest cost, with people spend-
ing about $18 per week. On average, alco-
hol costs students about $5.77 per week on 
campus; cover for bars and clubs costs $2.59 
on average. Another $3.43 per week goes 
toward ingredients for homemade meals 
and baked goods while another $3.33 per 
week is spent on gas to drive places.

Dishell said his circle tends to go out to 

the bars more often than most, and, while 
he can’t speak for everyone, the group is 
generally able to keep up with their habits. 
Still, he recognizes that many in his group 
come from a “place of privilege” and noted 
that many also have jobs lined up already 
for next year that could make up the costs 
later.

“Something my parents always taught 

me was everyone spends their money dif-
ferently,” he said. “There’s some people who 
may choose to go out way more frequently 
but when it comes to going to formal, which 
costs more money, or going to the bigger 
ticket items they might not do that.”

Pay to play
LSA sophomore Martha McKinnon 

joined Delta Gamma sorority early in her 
freshman year. McKinnon already feels 
connected with the women in her sorority, 
saying these are the best friends she’s ever 
had. Along with a love for Michigan football 
and going out to eat, McKinnon and her sis-
ters share something else in common: pay-
ing around $890 in dues for their sorority.

Sorority dues, which go toward a chap-

ter’s social events and activities, are widely 
acknowledged as one of the most burden-
some fees for joining an organization on 
campus.

According to the University’s Greek life 

website, the median dues owed for the first 
semester after joining a sorority is $370, 
with costs ranging for subsequent semes-
ters and additional payments often required 
for larger events. Fraternities have compa-
rable dues, though the numbers were not 
listed on the Greek Life website.

While non-Greek life organizations 

often also have dues, the University’s Office 
for Student Life, which oversees student 
activities including clubs, does not track the 
amounts each group charges.

According to the survey, a majority of 

students participate in clubs — 63 percent 
at least once a week and only 21 percent 
participate less than once a month to never. 
Additionally, students spend an average of 
$220.96 on larger expenses per semester. Of 
that, about $77 goes towards dues or fees for 
clubs. Other large expenses include about 
$62 for Michigan sporting events and about 
$37 for overnight trips.

For McKinnon, the money to pay her 

dues freshman year came out of her own 
pocket — though this year her parents cov-
ered the costs when they paid housing fees 
for her to live in the Delta Gamma house. 

$6,406. On top of tuition, books, and everyday living 

expenses, an average student will spend this amount on social 

expenses during their four years here. $6,406. That’s the 

amount it costs to truly experience social life at the University.

This spring break, my family and I traveled to Beaver 

Creek, Colorado to take advantage of the fifty-five inch 
base of snow and the varied terrain that make Beaver 
Creek and its surrounding mountain resorts sought after 
by amateur and professional skiers and snowboarders 
alike. Yet not even twenty minutes outside of the lavish 
environment of Beaver Creek exists a different Colorado, 
one that exists in its own pocket of time. Colorado has 
still held on to its quaint mining towns that were once 
the primary allure in the region, before the winter sports 
industry. On one of the less than optimal skiing days, I 
took a drive through three of these historic towns: Red 
Cliff, Leadville, and Georgetown. 

Accessed by a slim service road off of Highway-24, 

Red Cliff — with a population of 289 as of the 2000 
census — is a town reminiscent of Twin Peaks. It 
embodies a different kind of culture, one which is 
separated from the bustling world and probably likes to 
keep it that way. At an elevation of 10,152 feet, Leadville 

is a bit more “modern” than Red Cliff but still a far cry 
from its winter resort neighbors. Leadville is the kind of 
town where its most popular restaurant is “The Golden 
Burro,” with a sister location called “The Brass Ass.” 
Leadville’s historic neighborhood is an art piece itself. 
It’s buildings revel in the unique, from fences made of 
pre-1970 skis to homes painted in four different shades 
of purple and a sign that reads, “hippies use side door.” 
Lastly, Georgetown exists off of the freeway that takes 
you to the Denver airport. Because of this, many of its 
shops have turned into quaint touristy gift shops, but its 
historical charm can still be seen in places like Hotel de 
Paris and the original public school house. 

Beaver Creek will always be one of my favorite 

vacation spots. For a skier, the kind of experience it 
offers is something that few other mountains can 
compare to. But Colorado is so much more than that. 
Colorado is filled with a rich history that can be found 
tucked away in the shadows of its Rocky Mountains.

VISUAL STATEMENT: HIDDEN GEMS OF COLORADO’S PAST

Buildings aren’t the only vintage icons of Georgetown.
Past the public school and Hotel de Paris, the Buckley Garage represents the vintage feel of Georgetown.

Red Cliff Bridge is a very popular photo for drivers on Highway-24, and is 
one piece of Red Cliff’s historic atmosphere.

Leadville’s homes revel in uniqueness. The town thrived in the 
60’s and this is evident in the architecture.

Just outside of Leadville, Rancho Escondido has since been 
abandoned but still maintains its John Wayne feeling of the Old 
West.

Personal Statement: Why I run
by Mayank Mathur, Daily Arts Writer

E

arly on this semester, my friends 
and I were hit by the sudden urge to 
work out and get in shape. It wasn’t 

surprising, given that Spring Break was 
just around the corner. It was interesting 
and sometimes funny to see the varying 
degrees of enthusiasm with which differ-
ent people hit the gym. Some seemed to be 
genuinely motivated and others just went 
because, well, everyone else was going. I 
was somewhere in between; it had always 
been my plan to start on a healthier lifestyle 
this semester, and seeing my closest friends 
go regularly sometimes pushed me when I 
would have normally stayed in bed watch-
ing Netflix.

Most of us didn’t really know what to do 

at the gym once we got there, so we’d kind 
of do our own thing and keep an eye on each 
other at the same time. The fitter and more 
experienced among the herd would pass on 
their wisdom and guide us in our efforts, 
but even so, few of us really knew what was 
going on. Still, it was better than sitting at 
home and ordering in No Thai, and, besides, 
healthy competitiveness between friends is 
never a bad thing.

We kept an eye on each other, more than 

we’d care to admit. It was hard not to when 
you work out with four other people. I usu-
ally did my work on the running track and 
never stepped with my friends into the 
weights room. Some of them teased me for 
“running around like a dog” on the tracks 
instead of doing something less mundane 

than running in circles. It was funny, and 
sort of true — running in circles can get a lit-
tle boring. But, I always did it; I can’t recall a 
time when I went to the gym and didn’t step 
onto the track.

I’ve always wanted to be a good run-

ner, ever since I saw the training sequence 
from the first “Rocky” movie. Seeing Rocky 
sprint on the docks against the backdrop of 
a massive ship as “Gonna Fly Now” built up 
still gives me goosebumps. This is why, in 
high school, the annual 2.4-mile race was so 
important to me. As a perennial overweight 
underachiever in school, winning the race 
in front of a massive crowd was literally the 
stuff of my dreams.

One day senior year, I declared my ambi-

tion to win the race. Amused, my friends 
decided to set $100 at stake and give me 
eight months to undergo whatever prepara-
tion I needed to finish in the top three. The 
conviction with which they told me that I 
was going to fail hurt me and purely out of 
spite, I backed myself to prove them wrong.

On the day of the race, I was more fit than 

before but in no condition to compete for a 
spot on the podium. At some stage, the pas-
sion to run had been replaced by the obliga-
tion to, and I had lost motivation. I realized 
that ambition cannot be fueled solely by the 
desire to prove others wrong.

Since I was expecting my friends to mock 

me as I sat on the sidelines, the ordeal was 
brief and painless. However, once they 
knew I wasn’t participating, the effect of 

peer pressure waned. I realized that this 
shouldn’t have been about their doubts of 
my ability. This was about my insecurities 
and now, I had the chance to run that race 
and conquer them.

Ecstatic, I told my friends I was going to 

run. One of them looked me in the eye and 
said, “Don’t be stupid, sit down.” Doubt, 
insecurity, and fear took over once again 
and I was brought down to size. The whistle 
blew, and I was left wondering instead of 
realizing a dream.

It was then I realized that regret isn’t the 

sadness of making a wrong decision. It’s the 
agony of realizing how easy it was to make 
the right one. I felt it as I watched each 
contestant run past me. I could’ve easily 
stepped onto the track to run the race, but 
I did what people expected of me. I didn’t 
even try; I just stood there watching as oth-
ers lived my dream.

I wouldn’t have even come close to win-

ning, but that really wasn’t the point any-
more. It was about winning self-respect 
so I could look at myself and be proud of 
something I did. The underachiever in me 
needed a heroic act and that was my chance 
to prove to myself that I was more than 
what I thought. Three years on, I’m no lon-
ger obese. I look and feel different. How-
ever, that twinge of regret still remains. 
Although it inspires me to live freely, I know 
that I would much rather have the memory 
of completing the race motivate me rather 
than the regret of being a coward.

Her money is saved from a combination of earnings from pre-
vious jobs as well as a current on-campus job.

While she wouldn’t categorize her group of friends as hav-

ing expensive habits, McKinnon estimates she herself spends 
around $50 per week on dining and going out.

McKinnon said money isn’t terribly influential on what her 

friend group does but said many of her friends are judicious 
about where they spend their disposable cash, as most of them 
work for their spending money.

“Michigan’s an expensive school,” she said. “They talk about 

Michigan, at least when you hear about it when you’re touring, 
it’s sort of, ‘Oh, this amenity is included; this amenity is includ-
ed; this amenity is included.’ And then you come here and you 
realize what’s not included.”

While Greek life fees can pile up, there are other organiza-

tions on campus that require a notable starting cost.

The University has 31 club sports teams, which are orga-

nized leagues that compete with teams at other schools. Club 
teams are largely organized by students, but often have coach-
es, and compete in playoffs for national championships. The 
average cost of a club sport is roughly $434, though the prices 
range from just $30 for the club running team to around $2,750 
for the rowing team.

LSA sophomore Sara Lin is the treasurer of the women’s 

club gymnastics team. While the team does receive funding 
from the club sports organization, members are also required 
to pay $100 per semester. Additional costs are added when 
the team travels for meets and must pay for food, lodging, and 
travel.

Yet organized sports are less common than other activi-

ties, with only about one-quarter of students participating at 
least two-to-three times a month. Exercising, however, is very 
popular: about 66 percent reported going to a gym once a week 
or more frequently, with about 21 percent going daily. While 43 
percent of students never play sports, 22 percent play sports at 
least once a week.

Lin said a large portion of her time and money goes into her 

gymnastics team. She has been a gymnast all her life and said 
participating at the University — getting to spend her time in 
the gym with her friends — has been some of her favorite time 
on campus.

“It’s nice to go (to the gym) after classes or something and 

not necessarily have to work hard and you just have two friends 
you can talk to or a private gym almost,” she said.

The price may be steep, but for both Lin and McKinnon, the 

experience of joining a close-knit community makes it worth 
the money.

“It’s been a really good way for me to build friendships, as 

well as find a community,” McKinnon said. “I always kind of 
equate it to joining any other club. I mean, there is sort of an 
idea that Greek life is kind of different than any other extra-
curricular but it’s similar in the same way that everybody finds 
their group through it.”

Go Broke!
At any given home basketball game, students pack the lower 

bowl, drape themselves in as much maize clothing as they can 
find, and jump up and down from tip-off to game’s end. Con-
ducting the crowd is the leader of the student section, Maize 
Rage President Christian Tallarico.

Tallarico is an Engineering junior and a seriously devout 

Michigan fan. Since his freshman year, Tallarico has bought 
both football and men’s basketball tickets every year. On top of 
that, he also takes several road trips to away basketball games 
each year, typically with fellow Maize Rage members.

“I love the away games more than the home games, to be 

honest,” he said. “It was more fun freshman, sophomore year 
where we walk into an away game thinking we’re going to win 
and we’re confident and we’re not really taking crap from peo-
ple talking to us.”

Each year, Tallarico has taken around four to five trips for 

away basketball and football games. He estimates the cost per 
trip is about $200 per person, $300 for the trip to Chicago for 
the basketball Big Ten tournament. Last year, the combination 
of football tickets, basketball tickets and an at-Notre Dame 
ticket cost him $700.

This year, the University’s Athletic Department worked to 

accommodate the requests of students to make athletic events 
more accessible. Former Athletic Director Dave Brandon col-
laborated with the Central Student Government and in October 
2014 agreed to reduce ticket prices for student football tickets 
down to $175 from $280. In February of this year, the Athletic 

Department implemented need-based ticketing, offering fed-
eral Pell Grant eligible students the chance to buy significantly 
cheaper tickets for football, basketball and hockey.

As CSG President, Dishell was instrumental in this latest 

deal and said the number of Pell Grant-eligible students buy-
ing tickets has already increased 20 percent. Additionally, Tal-
larico said the department has been helpful to the Maize Rage 
as well, particularly for Big Ten tournament tickets, which are 
offered at a discount from regular season tickets.

Apart from these larger purchases, Tallarico said he and his 

friends rarely have any other social expenses. Tallarico saves 

his money from jobs and internships over the summer then 
budgets his sports year ahead of time, rarely going out to eat or 
to other events. For him, putting his money into tickets and his 
time into the Maize Rage is the only way to go.

“For most of us it’s a big reason why we’re here and if you 

want to get together with us I can assure you you’re going to be 
at the front of all the basketball games, you’re going to have the 
opportunity to get all the away tickets,” he said.

What are you really paying for?
Whatever a student choses to spend their money on, the 

hope is that it goes to good use and helps create an experi-
ence that a proud Wolverine can remember for years to come. 
And, for the most part, it appears University students feel good 
about the money they spend.

When asked whether they felt money played a significant 

role in their social lives, 38 percent of students agreed and 20 
percent strongly agreed. A majority of students feel they are 
able to “keep up” financially with their friends, with 43 percent 
agreeing and 16 percent strongly agreeing. A majority also dis-
agree that “money has inhibited their social life” at the Univer-
sity — though 18 percent agreed and 4 percent strongly agreed 
with that statement.

There were still variances in response. Students com-

ing from homes making less than $100,000 annually were 
less likely to agree that they can keep up with their friends 
financially than those coming from houses making $150,000 
or over. Of students from the higher socioeconomic bracket, 
38.86 percent strongly agreed that they have a great social life, 
compared to the 16.42 percent of lower-income students who 
strongly agreed.

Engineering junior Joe Spurlin handles all his money per-

sonally, socially, or otherwise. Spurlin classifies himself as 
middle class and receives financial aid through federal grants, 
as well as money for the University. He supplements this with 
a part-time on-campus job.

Spurlin spends roughly close to the average per-week 

amount, estimating at around $30. He also participates in a 
local hockey league and has football and hockey tickets.

However, Spurlin said he has to spend extra effort manag-

ing his money, because his money for housing, food, and social 
activities all come from the same place. For him, keeping up 
with his friend group can become difficult at times.

“I do have friends who their parents pay for everything in 

terms of tuition and housing so that all the money they make, 
all the money they have is stuff that they put towards lunch 
and dinner and stuff like that,” he said. “It always feels like 
they can spend more freely than I can.”

While Spurlin is undoubtedly not alone in this experience, 

University students aren’t exclusively spending money to have 
fun. A large portion of students are having fun for cheap, fre-
quently hanging out with their friends with no specific activ-
ity. A resounding 72 percent of students “chill” two-to-three 
times a week, or more frequently.

Watching TV and movies are also popular activities, with 

56 percent watching at least two-to-three times a week, if not 
daily. Video games are less popular: only about one-quarter of 
students play at least once a week.

The University also provides a considerable amount of free 

or reduced-price activities. The Michigan Union’s Umix offers 
a free meal on Friday nights, a variety of programs provide 
accessible tickets to on-campus shows, and, though many clubs 
do require dues of some sort, there are still plenty of free orga-
nizations for students to get involved in.

In the end, 70 percent of campus believe they have a great 

social life that they will look back on fondly. Though the Uni-
versity might have expensive taste, at the very least it appears 
a good portion are able to find their social niche, wherever it 
may be.

“Spending time in lounges, we all watch ‘The Bachelor’ on 

Mondays together, that’s just like a social event that we do 
without spending money,” Spurlin said. “You can have a good 
college experience regardless of the amount of money you 
have.”

Brad Paisley warbles that you’ll never leave Harlan alive. 

At the beginning of this March, my Alternative Spring 
Break service trip traveled to the area depicted on FX’s 
popular series, “Justified,” where jaw-dropping mountains, 
hard-nosed Southern charm, and rusted remains of a 
formerly dominant coal-mining industry meet in the heart 
of the Appalachian Mountains.

We spent the school year learning about rural poverty in 

Appalachia, but it wasn’t until we got there that we realized 
the realities behind the rust. 

In our short stay, we had the privilege to be welcomed 

by families living in the area. The Lankfords were one such 
family.

Danny Lankford and his wife, Rita, have been fighting 

cancer and bankruptcy in Harlan County, Kentucky. Ever 
since Danny was laid off from the coal mines, they have 
had a continuing string of troubles. Nine years ago a mining 
company bought out the couple’s previous home and they 
were forced to relocate their residence. A diagnosis of 
prostate cancer forced Danny into retirement from city 

work. Just two years later Rita was diagnosed with colon 
cancer, adding to their financial strain.

Danny lists these calamities nonchalantly, as if they 

are just a part of life in Harlan. Danny and Rita’s story is 
complex. Many members in the community share their 
struggles, where the remnants of a once-booming industry 
remain destructive to the environment and the lives of 
residents living in the valleys.

“The industrial revolution in America of manufacturing 

is over with,” Lankford said. “It’s been over with here for a 
long time. We’ve basically been left out, left behind. We 
don’t really count no more.

“We can survive. That’s what the people in Appalachia 

been doing before coal came, they survived.”

Despite the circumstances, Danny is perfectly content 

doing just that; surviving. As he looked off his deck into 
his own mountain ‘paradise,’ he explained that he has no 
desire to ever leave Harlan, alive or dead.

“At this age, you can’t make no dreams come true, just 

live out the ones you made,” he said.

VISUAL STATEMENT: SURVIVING APPALACHIA

The last day we visited, all of the puppies that had shared a room with Danny and Rita were adopted 
except for the runt, Minnie.

The Lankfords were caring for their daughter’s dogs, Bobo and Duchess, 
after her move out of her ex-husband’s houswe. The couple was taking 
care of seven dogs in addition to a new litter of a dozen puppies.

The Lankfords daughter recently underwent a divorce from her abusive husband. He was a nurse, and 
Danny claims the desensitization to violence might have been a factor in his actions.

Danny said “being out here is all I need” of his mountain home. Companies are currently fighting for the ability to conduct mountaintop 
removal on some peaks in Danny’s backyard. This practice would pose multiple environmental problems like stopping regional rainfall.

Danny and Rita traded home cookied meals and conversation for 
our work repainting and sprucing up the interior of their home.
