ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Cruising into the bye
Michigan dispatches a 
hapless Maryland team, 
38-7, heads into the bye week 
brimming with confidence.

Each month, The Michigan 
Daily’s Administration Beat sits 
down with University President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
to 
discuss 
important 
questions 
about 
University policy, commitments 
and challenges. Topics discussed 
in the interview included the 
Detroit Center for Innovation, 
the 2020 presidential debate, 
carbon neutrality and more. This 
transcript has been abbreviated 
and reordered for reader clarity.
Detroit Center for Innovation
The Michigan Daily: Recently, 
the University announced it will 
collaborate to open the Detroit 
Center for Innovation. While 
the University states this project 
will further the goal of fostering 
a collaborative relationship with 
Detroit, there has been some 
backlash. Specifically, some have 

taken to social media calling 
on the University to improve 
funding to Flint and Dearborn 
campuses before beginning a 
$300 million project, while others 
have referred to the University’s 
investment 
as 
gentrification. 
What is your response to both of 
these criticisms?
President 
Mark 
Schlissel: 
These (criticisms) may be based 
on faulty information. So the 
University as a whole has over 
300 projects going on in Detroit. 
This is just the latest one. Most of 
them involve things where we’re 
working with the Detroit public 
K-12 school students. We have a 
new school we’re collaborating 
on at Marygrove, at the site of the 
old Marygrove College. We’ve 
got the Michigan Engineering 
Zone, a robotics program for 
high school students. We have 
a mentoring program for kids 
heading into medicine.

CPS teachers’ strike, wildfires in CA 
may impact early action applications

‘U’ grants exemptions for deadlines on an individual basis under pressing circumstances

Democratic group Priorities 
USA filed a lawsuit on Oct. 
30 alleging Michigan violates 
voter rights when allowing 
absentee ballots to be thrown 
out if voter signatures do 
not match those on other 
documents held by election 
officials.
Priorities USA is a political 
action committee originally 
founded in 2011 to support 
the 
re-election 
of 
former 
President 
Barack 
Obama. 
Their lawsuit alleges Michigan 
law has clerks compare voter 
signatures on absentee ballot 
applications with those on 
qualified state voter lists. 
If the signatures do not 
match, the clerk must reject 
the 
absentee 
application. 
Similarly, if the signature 
on an absentee ballot does 
not match the signature on 
another reference signature, 
the clerk must throw the vote 
out. 
A Priorities USA statement 
said the signature-match law 
violates citizens’ right to vote 
and to procedural process 
under both the First and 
Fourteenth 
Amendments.

A 
new 
Senate 
bill 
was 
introduced 
to 
the 
Michigan 
Legislature in mid-October with 
the goal to officially include 
gender 
identity 
and 
sexual 
orientation as protected classes 
under Michigan’s hate crime laws. 
Currently, 
Michigan’s 
hate 
crime law only enforces penalties 
for 
those 
who 
intimidate 
individuals based on “race, color, 
religion, 
gender, 
or 
national 
origin.” The new bill would 
offer much needed protections 
for individuals in the LGBTQ 
community. 
State 
Sen. 
Jeremy 
Moss, 
D-Southfield, served two terms 
in 
the 
Michigan 
House 
of 
Representatives 
before 
being 
elected as a senator. Earlier this 
year, he introduced a bill in the 
House that would expand the 
Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act 
to include protections for sexual 
orientation and gender identity, 
especially with regard to housing 
and employment. 
“For the last 30 plus years, 
members of the LGBT community 
have tried to include sexual 
orientation and gender identity 
as protected classes here in 
Michigan,” Moss said. 

Gender identity, sexual 
orientation now included 
in MI state legislature

In response to the recent 
announcement, the University of 
Michigan will work with the city 
of Detroit to build a $300 million 
Detroit Center for Innovation, 
University students created a 
petition urging the University to 
reconsider the facility. According 
to an email from University 
President Mark Schlissel, the 
education and research complex 

will provide undergraduate and 
graduate teaching in subjects 
like 
artificial 
intelligence, 
cybersecurity and technology. 
The 
petition 
specifically 
condemns the University’s choice 
to build the Center on the failed 
site of the proposed Wayne County 
jail, the construction of which was 
halted in 2013 when the project 
went $91 million over its initial 
budget. It also criticized the 
University for investing in Detroit 
Renaissance Real Estate Fund 

LP, a firm with ties to a string of 
evictions in Detroit. 
“Yet with this decision, the 
University 
Administration 
signals its priorities in Detroit 
do not lie with Detroiters,” the 
petition reads. “Surely, a genuine 
commitment to the city would not 
include investing in a company that 
profits off of evicting Detroiters 
from their homes, despite criticism 
from students and community 
members on the investment. Nor 
would it ignore plans from the 

Detroit Justice Center to develop 
a restorative justice initiative on 
the once-failed jail site where the 
Innovation Center will now lie.” 
The petition, which was started 
by One University spokesperson 
and LSA junior Amytess Girgis, 
calls on the University to discuss 
future 
building 
plans 
with 
residents of Detroit and consider 
the needs of the city’s population.

In the past few weeks, 
Chicago students have dealt 
with the consequences of an 
11-day teacher’s strike, while 
millions of California residents 
have lost power and have 
even been forced to evacuate 
their homes.These unforeseen 
circumstances have presented 
barriers for high school seniors 
applying to colleges, including 
the University of Michigan, in 
time for early deadlines.
When 
LSA 
sophomore 
Anna Nedoss was applying 
to colleges two years ago, she 
relied on her counselor in the 
Chicago Public School System 
throughout the process.
However, Chicago students 
like Nedoss who are applying 
this 
year 
were 
unable 
to 
contact their counselors for 

11 days, as the CPS staff and 
teachers had been on strike 
through Thursday, when a 
contract 
between 
the 
city 
and union was agreed upon. 
Classes resumed on Friday.
“When I was applying, my 
counselor was definitely a big 
resource to me,” Nedoss said. 
“If you don’t have access to 
your counselor — the person 
who actually sends your info to 
the colleges you’re applying to 
— it’s not pointless, but there’s 
definitely barriers you just 
can’t get past.”
Similarly, 
in 
Southern 
California 
many 
schools 
have 
been 
closed 
for 
the 
past week as a result of the 
fires. 
Engineering 
junior 
Courtney Bagnall lives near 
the Getty area, the location 
of wildfire that began early 
Monday morning and was 
only 15 percent contained by 

Wednesday. Bagnall lives far 
enough away that her family 
was not required to evacuate, 
but close enough that her 
family members could see 
smoke through the window. As 
a result, the local high school 
was closed multiple days this 
week.
In 
addition 
to 
needing 
counselors 
to 
submit 
information on behalf of their 
students, teachers —who are on 
strike in Chicago and possibly 
evacuating their homes in 
South California — often write 
letters 
of 
recommendation 
for students. These letters are 
considered part of a complete 
application for colleges and 
cannot 
be 
submitted 
by 
students in most cases.
The situations high school 
seniors in these areas face 
highlight obstacles students 
encounter 
when 
trying 

to 
submit 
early 
college 
applications this year. Nedoss 
noted a lack of access to 
internet at home and public 
transportation to get to a public 
library like many students in 
Chicago. Bagnall questioned 
how students and faculty could 
submit documents online with 
the widespread power outages 
and mandated evacuations.
“I don’t know how you 
would deal with not having 
a computer and not having 
your 
counselor 
reading 
the 
application 
or 
simply 
just sending in the teacher 
recommendations,” 
Bagnall 
said. “I don’t know how that 
would happen by the deadline 
if class is still cancelled and 
the fires are still going.”

We’ve got Wolverine Pathways, 
the pipeline program, and we’ve got 
research programs in collaboration 
with community advocates. We’re 
embedded in the Mayor’s Office 
with the Poverty Solutions Initiative. 
So, this is another of a series 
of projects we’re doing where we 
look for opportunities to fulfill the 
University’s mission of research and 
teaching in ways that have benefits 
to the public we serve and, in this 
case, in Detroit. We were invited by 
the city and by Steve Ross — one of 
our alumni donors — and by Dan 
Gilbert, a developer in the city, to 
become an anchor tenant of the 
project we’re conceiving of, that 
you read about. We’re actually not 
spending any money building the 
building at all. It’s going to be built 
by a series of donors and then gifted 
to the University. So, although it 
may end up costing as much as 
$300 million, the University won’t 
be paying for it. We’ll be receiving 
it, in effect, as a gift. And our role is 
to set up educational and research 

programs that help drive the 
entrepreneurial 
and 
technology 
part of the Detroit economy, so that 
new businesses form and existing 
companies grow and they don’t leave 
Detroit and, ultimately, the economy 
does well enough to provide more 
jobs for more people.
2020 Presidential Debate
TMD: The University announced 
it would be hosting one of the 2020 
presidential debates on campus. 
What precautions will the school 
take to help communities that may 
be put at risk, such as communities of 
color and undocumented students, 
given all the national attention 
and heightened law enforcement 
presence? 
 MS: The election will be the 
biggest news of the coming year, and 
it will affect every one of your lives 
without a doubt, for better or for 
worse … One of the things that I think 
is very important is that students 
in your generation feel a sense of 
ownership of our democracy, and 
feel not just an obligation to vote, but 
an excitement to vote, to really learn 
about the issues, to try to get past the 
invective and the polarized nature 
of debate. 

In terms of the physical safety, 
the event itself will be held down 
in the Crisler Center … so it’s away 
from the heart of the campus. So, 
our day-to-day activities of going to 
class, and going to labs, and going 
to the library, and going back and 
forth to the dorms will be relatively 
unaffected, although the city will 
be more crowded. I don’t think it’ll 
be more crowded than a football 
Saturday.
The safety, we’ve got a year 
to plan for it … It’s not just our 
DPSS, but it’s state police, all the 
national security apparatus will 
be here. It’ll probably be the safest 
place in America, physically. The 
issue of psychological threat and 
psychological harm, I recognize 
that it’s going to be a stressful year 
because the body of politics is very 
polarized, and there’s a lot of fear 
mongering as part of the debate, and 
we’re all subject to that. I think that 
it may be of more intensity because 
everyone is here in town, but I 
think it’s going to be pretty intense 
no matter what. We have CAPS … 
Student Life will convene watching 
parties so that we can watch the 
debates together.”
Sexual Assault
TMD: Recently the University 
released its climate survey on sexual 
assault. The data from the campus 
climate survey showed decreased 
reports of sexual misconduct against 
undergraduate women compared 
to the survey in 2015. First, do 
you believe it is fair to interpret 
the findings as fewer instances of 
misconduct against undergraduate 
women, or could the decrease be 
attributed to fear of reporting?
 MS: All I can tell you is the survey 
was done the same exact way, asking 
the same questions with the same 
kind of incentives to answer a few 
years ago and then very recently. So, 
I don’t think it’s due to a change in 
comfort reporting. I think there are 
some people who aren’t comfortable 
reporting no matter what, I think 
there are some people that are 
uncomfortable making a claim of 
misconduct to the University and 
having it investigated. I think more 
people are probably comfortable 
talking or providing results in an 
anonymous survey. Whether that 
number changes over the course 
of years, I don’t know. But I can 

tell you, even though our numbers 
moved in the right direction, it’s 
nowhere close to where we need to 
be. It’s still an amazing thing that 
such a high percentage of students, 
men and women, are subject to all 
different types of sexual harassment 
and sexual misconduct. So, even if 
the frequency has gone down by a 
few percent, we’re nowhere close to 
where we need to be, and we have 
to double down on the things that 
we’re doing.
We’ve had to change the way we 
investigate and adjudicate sexual 
misconduct cases due to the order 
of a court of appeals, so lots of things 
are changing, and we’re trying 
to get it right. The one thing that 
really strikes me is that, although 
we’re focusing a lot of attention 
on this problem of misconduct at 
universities, it doesn’t only happen 
at universities, and it doesn’t only 
happen when you’re 20. It happens 
when you’re 15 sometimes or, you 
know, really young. So, it’s our 
piece of a big societal problem. 
And personally, I don’t think that 
rules and laws can get rid of sexual 
misconduct. And even if we come up 
with a much better way to adjudicate 
cases, I don’t think that will 
eliminate sexual misconduct. It’s so 
common and so depressing everyday 
that what’s going to get rid of it is you 
all looking each other in the eye and 
saying, “We’re not going to tolerate 
this in our community.” Not just you, 
but 46,000 “yous” where you just 
say, “Look, this is literally ridiculous. 
This will not happen in my house.” 
And we don’t have enough police to 
sit in every party and every meeting, 
and stand next to every man and 
woman on the campus and make 
sure nobody puts their hands where 
somebody doesn’t want to go. That’s 
up to all of us as a community to kind 
of crowdsource the solution to this, 
to really say, “This is not tolerable; 
we will not let this happen.” And 
if 95 percent of you can say that, it 
will stop. And we have to figure out 
how to get everyone to embrace a 
sense of shared ownership that men 
and women in the classroom, in the 
dormitory, in the parties, wherever 
you are, that as a community, we are 
not going to let this happen.

From Page 1A


A few weeks ago, I had the 
pleasure of visiting the Pan-African 
Pulp exhibition at the University 
of Michigan Museum of Arts. This 
part of the museum showcases art 
by Meleko Mogosi, a South African 
painter. Now, his art was nowhere 
near mediocre. Each piece revealed 
a different layer of the nuanced topic 
that is the black experience. Some 
parts of the exhibit paid tribute 
to a magazine comic that shed 
light on the different oppressions 
that were common across Africa. 
Another showcased the many black 
women who have contributed to 
the progression of the Pan-African 
movement. Seeing the history and 
culture of my people depicted so 
intricately and colorfully caused me 
to stand in awe. As I continued to take 
in my surroundings though, the tour 
guide pointed out one piece of the 
exhibit that she didn’t give the same 
in depth analyzation of.
This picture piece (part of which 
is pictured above) was, in my opinion, 
almost like multiple paintings in one. 
One part of the picture portrayed 
two men wrestling while two others 

watched. Though I admired the 
artistic skill needed to draw the detail 
in their muscles, the connection that 
these fighting men had to the larger 
idea of the black struggle wasn’t 
clear to me initially. Apparently I 
wasn’t the only one because someone 
else asked the tour guide for an 
interpretation. The guide responded 
with, “I’m not sure, I think it just 
represents ritual spectator sport, 
maybe it’s a ritual in certain parts 
of the continent.” Some might have 
been underwhelmed by this answer, 
but I was personally intrigued. This 
simplistic 
interpretation 
of 
this 
part of the painting highlighted 
something that is missing from 
mainstream visual art - black people 
just living their lives.
As I reflected on this, I realized 
that 
this 
same 
sentiment 
also 
translates to Black representation in 
media and film. In the same way in 
which we are regularly exposed to 
romantic comedies, fairytale dramas, 
and action movies starring other 
races of people, we do not get that 
same variety when it comes to movies 
with a predominantly Black cast. 
Most of the recent movies that have a 
noticeable Black presence are stories 
about the struggles of being Black.
When I approached the tour 

guide after the presentation was 
over, we talked more about the 
partial simplicity of this piece. We 
agreed that while stories about 
the Black experience still need to 
be told, it is still frustrating to only 
be able to see Black people on the 
screen when we’re “performing our 
race” and racial traumas for other 
people’s entertainment. There needs 
to be a balance. A balance between 
Black struggles and Black smiles, a 
reminder to everyone that we don’t 
always have to be a superhero to be 
worth the time of day. A sentiment 
that goes far beyond Hollywood.
In a world that still tells us that 
we have to be twice as good to get 
half as much, it would be nice if 
Hollywood didn’t reiterate the same 
message. The tour guide told me that 
contemporary discourse calls the 
need for more regular depiction of 
Black people as “the need for more 
Black mediocrity.”
Though the plethora of recent 
movies about people of my race 
overcoming struggles has immensely 
fueled my sense of hope, I think 
that we’ll never truly be at a point 
of holistic, all-encompassing Black 
representation until we are able 
to normalize “black mediocrity” 
depicted in black art.

In the midst of the 10-year 
anniversary of League of Legends, 
a multiplayer online battle arena 
(MOBA) game by Riot Games, I 
find myself reflecting on the too 
many hours that I’ve spent on 
LoL alongside its other 80-million 
monthly players. When my cousin 
introduced me to the game in 2011, 
the champion (LoL’s name for its 
characters) Ahri, an overly seductive, 
spellcasting representation of Korea’s 
mythic nine-tailed fox, had just been 
released. She blew sparkly pink kisses 
as weapons, quickly became an icon 
for furries and e-girls everywhere, 
and was essentially a sex-positive 
woman of color, so I had to start 
playing as her immediately. Eight 
years and eight Ahri skins later, I’ve 
returned to occasional nights spent 
on League of Legends for the same 
reasons that I began: bonding with 
my friends as I developed my online 
literacy skills within the most toxic 
environment possible.
Not only was I the ripe age of 
eleven when I started playing LoL 
with my cousin and his friends, 
but I was also a 4-foot-something, 
unintimidating 
fairy 
of 
a 
boy. 
Although personal information is 
completely hidden from other players 
on LoL, your in-game performance 
may make you a target for users 
to verbally harass you based on 
sheer assumptions about your play 

style and character. Like any other 
competitive activity, playing LoL 
meant that you sometimes played not 
so well. When you don’t play well, you 
can be guaranteed that the other nine 
anonymous players in the game are 
eager to flame you with their highly 
inappropriate arsenal of identity-
based insults, threats to report you 
after the game, and general offensive 
language that seems to be accessible 
to people who can’t seem to act right 
in real life. As I honed my skills, I 
became increasingly desensitized to 
whatever may be said in the in-game 
chat room, eventually learning that 
rather than any lack of game playing 
skills, many players haven’t quite 
leveled up their online social skills. 

A year after I started playing, 
Riot Games introduced their Honor 
system with the purpose of rewarding 
players’ positive behavior in the form 
of points across three categories: 
Stayed Cool, Great Shotcalling, and 
GG <3. During a game, I don’t usually 
say a lot to anybody that I’m playing, 
save for the occasional “good job” and 
“thank u,” because typing will take 
me further out of the game as if I’m 
not already blasting Blackpink in my 
AirPods while I fled from the enemy 
team. It amazed me just how often 
that I’m honored by my teammates 
as a result of being nothing more than 
civil. The most “honorable” games 
that I’ve played have been when 
my team has cooperated with each 

other without any negative judgment 
upon our mistakes or missed plays. 
When your team is comprised of 
your friends, honor is second as to 
having fun. Trolling only becomes 
kinda funny once you figure out 
that someone is trolling… and if that 
someone is you.
With time, I learned how to master 
my champion and how to stay calm in 
LoL: just play. Hating the player won’t 
lead to them doing any better — if 
anything, they’ll perform even worse. 
Hating the game defeats the entire 
purpose of playing. After all, if you’re 
not having fun, why are you playing?

You know the drill: On the first day 
of class, you go through some less-
than-stellar icebreaker, you try not to 
fall asleep as the professor reads the 
syllabus, you count the minutes until 
you can be let out early. Depending 
on how long the professor spends 
on the syllabus, you could leave ten 
minutes early or thirty minutes early 
or an hour early.
Some 
instructors 
— 
in 
my 
experience, two graduate students 

and one tenured professor — spend 
extra time discussing diversity, 
equity, and inclusion; accessibility; 
Title IX; and mental health, all of 
which I appreciate, because have 
you seen the standard LS&A blurbs 
on these issues? They’re scant, one-
paragraph descriptions that barely 
scratch the surface of these concerns. 
Some instructors don’t bother to add 
the bare minimum into their syllabi 
at all.
And on the opposite end, you have 
the professors who go out of their 
way to tell you about why they didn’t 
add something onto the syllabus, 
namely, content or trigger warnings. 

This happened once my freshman 
year in a history class and once this 
semester in an English class. In my 
history course, after the professor 
went on a short rant on how trigger 
warnings coddled students, a few 
people in the class argued with 
him, which eventually turned into a 
thirty-minute discussion on trigger 
warnings. In my English course, the 
professor explained he didn’t add 
content or trigger warnings to the 
syllabus because they would spoil the 
books we would be reading.
Of 
course, 
you 
can’t 
avoid 
harrowing topics that have already 
occurred in history or that have been 

published in print forever. People 
respond to triggers differently, too; 
it could be a smell or a color, rather 
than the name of the subject itself, 
that pulls the person out of the 
moment and into an anxiety or panic 
attack, or worse.
But that doesn’t mean that 
content/trigger warnings shouldn’t 
be present in syllabi. To the 
argument about how they insulate 
students from hard-hitting topics: 
it isn’t like content warnings make 
it mandatory that students avoid 
the topic (although I recognize that 
some students will take advantage 
of this to just skip some readings; but 

don’t we do that already anyways?). 
Rather, they’re supposed to function 
as warnings, as the name suggests, 
to be aware that a particular week’s 
reading or lecture will touch upon an 
issue that could be mentally harmful 
for the student. If the warnings are 
meant for those who have already 
experienced the trauma at hand, 
then the coddling argument becomes 
a bit porous, since students who 
have undergone trauma are far from 
having been insulated, and have 
experienced something that can’t be 
taught in a classroom.
As for the argument about spoilers 
in the English classroom — the 

content warning doesn’t have to go 
into great detail about what happens 
in the book. It could be as general as 
“this novel touches upon issues of 
racial and sexual violence,” which is 
something you might already find in 
a summary or book review. If you’re 
really concerned about spoilers over 
students’ mental health and well-
being, then you could go even more 
general than that and say, “this 
novel touches upon issues that may 
be disturbing or triggering for some 
students.”

Exploring alternative 
femininity through the 
Asian Baby Girl

A term that gets thrown 
around a lot in the Asian 
American 
community 
is 
“Asian Baby Girl,” or “ABG” 
for short. An ABG is known 
to frequent raves, have bleach 
blonde tips, sport tattoos, 
date b-boys and, without 
hesitation, 
fight 
anyone 
talking 
smack 
about 
her. 
Some people jokingly describe 
themselves as ABGs while 
others aspire to be them. 
My feelings about the ABG 
have been complicated. I grew 
up in a mostly traditional 
Vietnamese household, where 
I was taught that femininity 
was exemplified by softness 
and reservation, which really 
meant 
being 
submissive 
in practice. I always held 
my tongue around elders 
(including a cousin who was 
only six months older than 
I was) because they were 
supposed to know best. Out 
of “respect” for myself and 
those 
surrounding 
me, 
I 
had to uphold a modest and 
natural appearance — I was 
not allowed to dye my hair or 
wear makeup. I never would 
have dreamed about doing 
any of the things associated 
with the ABG lifestyle lest my 
family disown me. 
During my college years, 
however, I learned to see the 
ABG’s way of life not as an 

antithesis to femininity but 
as a valid, alternative form of 
it. Her glam makeup defies 
conservative 
Asian 
beauty 
standards and affirms the 
presence of people of color in 
the cosmetic industry, whose 
products 
and 
techniques 
have long been created to 
specifically 
complement 
white women’s features. At 
the same time, her knowledge 
of American pop culture and 
taste for streetwear are a 
reminder that she grew up 
in the States and that this is 
her home too. In short, the 
ABG exudes a uniquely Asian 
American sense of femininity. 
I admire the ABG for being 
unapologetic about herself 
and her interests. 
Recently, after a family 
friend witnessed an argument 
between me and my father, 
she asked my father if he 
regretted having a daughter, 
suggesting that I had failed 
as one when I challenged his 
beliefs and reinforcing the 
old idea that the best way to 
be feminine is to be invisible. 
This was a case in which a 
woman was upholding the 
patriarchy by keeping another 
woman (me) in line, and it 
made me realize that I had 
been doing something similar 
by dismissing the ABG for 
being a “bad woman” (and 
not “bad” as in attractive or 
amazing, but “bad” as in the 
opposite of good). 
Now, do not misunderstand 

me — I am not saying that 
the 
ABG 
is 
the 
perfect 
woman, either. I am merely 
trying to show that there is 
some merit in what the ABG 
represents, that she is not 
rebellious just for the sake of 
rebellion. Though the ABG 
has her faults (we should 
not 
go 
around 
throwing 
punches at the first person 
who 
speaks 
unfavorably 
about us), it is refreshing to 
see that a woman can defend 
herself and be revered for it. 
Further, those characteristics 
traditionally associated with 
femininity are not inherently 
problematic. I do think that 
I am soft, for example, but I 
regard my softness as more of 
a strength than a weakness. It 
usually makes me empathetic 
and is why, in my pre-medical 
education, I care so much 
about bedside manner (i.e., 
I believe that doctors should 
be sensitive to their patients’ 
emotional needs). I do not 
have to abandon the qualities 
that make me who I am to 
appreciate alternative forms 
of femininity. Instead, I retain 
the qualities that I take pride 
and work to develop those that 
I admire in other women. True 
feminine power is exhibited 
when a woman lives her life 
according to her own values, 
and while we should praise 
women who are able to do so, 
we should also be cognizant 
of the social and structural 
forces at play. 

When you do it, 
it’s not funny

Content warning or spoiler?

May 4th, a Saturday. I was 
preparing for the dorm move 
out, wrapping up my first year 
of college. I was waiting in 
line in front of the community 
center to receive a temporary 
key to use over the weekend. 
Residential assistants asked a 
white student in front of me 
if his room went through the 
final inspection. He answered, 
“yes, an Asian guy checked my 
room.” After a short awkward 
silence, the RA’s confirmed 
the 
inspector’s 
name. 
He 
asked the RA’s, “was that 
un-PC?” They answered, “no, 
we all understand what you’re 
saying.” Until then it was all 
fine, but then he added, “what 
if I said like slanty eyes?” The 
RA’s chuckled and answered, 
“oh, then it’d be tragic.” 
What’s really tragic is the fact 
that I couldn’t do anything 
but rant about the incident 
over the phone to my friend.
So-called “Hipster Racism” 
refers to something racist 
done in a ‘sarcastic’ way. Its 

supposed point is being a 
satire of racism, not racism 
itself. 
Sometimes, 
Asians 
make satires that appropriate 
and reverse racist remarks 
against Asians. However, if 
you are not of that identity, 
that context does not apply 
and excuse you from making 
such 
remarks. 
It 
is 
still 
racism.
Listening to his words, I 
felt as if all my values and 
possibilities were reduced to 
“slanty eyes.” For instance, I 
am an international student 
studying 
Political 
Science 
and Art, writing for the Daily 
and 
serving 
the 
Student 
Government. But to him, I 
was nothing but “slanty eyes.” 
This kind of speech tends 
to disregard multiple layers 
and facets of our identity, 
disrespect 
our 
ambition, 
dream, and effort. It has been 
exactly a year since I came 
to the United States and I 
encountered 
plain 
racism 
many times. However, even 
if it is done in a satirical way, 
it is just as offensive as plain 
racism. Yes, I do get it, but 
when you do it, it’s not funny.

The power of the period

A time for reckoning on Turkey

I

f 
menstruation 
were 
a 
mountain, I have no doubt 
she’d 
humble 
even 
the 
bravest climbers. For one, there’s 
no question she’d be abrupt. 
Rather than gently rolling slopes, 
her inclines would be steep and 
unforgiving, especially to those 
who decided to wear white 
pants on the climb. The hiking 
path leading up the summit 
would be tiresome and filled 
with turns so tight they’d cramp 
any climber’s style. Throughout 
your weeklong climb, she’d find a 
way to always keep you guessing. 
Whether it be through sudden 
landslides 
or 
unpredictable 
weather, the mountain would 
find new and creative ways to 
challenge climbers. Every time 
climbers reached a new peak, 
they wouldn’t be surprised if 
confronted by a red hot pool of 
lava that delays their efforts and 
disrupts their day. Rather than 
feeling empowered after tackling 
the rigorous challenge, those who 
climb the menstrual mountain 
would be met with shame and 
stigma for their act. 
Ultimately, that is because 
unlike 
mountain 
climbing, 
menstruation is not viewed by 
society as empowering. In the 
last few years, the United States 
has seen profound breakthroughs 
in the fight against barriers to 
menstrual 
health. 
Nonprofits 
such as PERIOD are building a 
“menstrual 
movement.” 
Most 
recently, a Wayne State University 
chapter of PERIOD helped host, 
along with other university 
chapters, 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s first National Period 
Day 
demonstration 
in 
the 
Diag to call for the University 
to 
provide 
free 
menstrual 
products to students in an effort 
to combat period poverty. In 
short, period poverty refers 
to a lack of access to sanitary 
products and the menstrual 
hygiene education necessary 
to ensure menstrual health. Of 
course, inspiring conversation 
about menstrual health and 
period 
poverty 
is 
vital 
to 
eliminating 
them. 
However, 
the taboo surrounding periods 
themselves has made starting 
these conversations an uphill 
battle. While period poverty 
and barriers to menstrual health 
are problematic, menstruation 
should 
not 
be 
painted 
in 
the same light. Eliminating 
menstrual stigma will require 
transforming 
our 
views 
of 
periods 
themselves. 
Luckily, 
innovation in public health can 
catalyze 
this 
transformation 
from the mindset that periods 
are a problem to the mindset 
that periods are powerful.
If you need proof that periods 
are powerful, then look no 
further than the prospect of 
menstrual diagnostics. It’s no 
secret that periods are snapshots 
of your greater health. I remember 
my own family physician insisting 
that having my period was good 
because it indicated that my body 
was healthy and functioning 
normally. 
A 
start-up 
called 
LifeStory Health has acted on 
this realization by exploring the 
diagnostic potential of menstrual 
blood. Anna Villarreal, CEO 

and founder of LifeStory, has 
partnered with the International 
Society 
for 
Pharmaceutical 
Engineering 
to 
create 
tools 
that can “diagnose and manage 
diseases” 
from 
proteins 
in 
menstrual blood earlier than 
current methods. According to 
the company’s website, LifeStory 
Health has already concluded 
a “Proof of Concept study” in 
which it “confirmed the potential 
use and pathway” of using 
menstrual blood to detect early 
onset Alzheimers in individuals 
assigned female at birth. In 
the future, studying menstrual 
blood will break down barriers 
to inclusive clinical research. 
Historically, “menstruators of 
child bearing ages” have been 
underrepresented 
in 
clinical 
trials. 
However, 
because 
menstrual blood comes from this 
unique population, using it as a 
diagnostic tool will encourage 
clinical research to look more 
closely at the impact of new 
therapeutics on the menstruators’ 
bodies. It’s important to note 
that “not all menstruators are 
women;” 
cis-gender 
women, 
transgender 
and 
non-binary 
individuals 
have 
all 
been 
historically 
underrepresented 
in clinical research. Ultimately, 
menstruation has the power 
to save lives by enhancing 
the efficacy of diagnosis and 
research. One day, it could prove 
to be the difference between 
being a survivor or a victim to 
chronic disease.

Nevertheless, 
the 
power 
of the period is not limited to 
benefiting menstruators’ health. 
In fact, periods can benefit 
entire communities and the 
environment. Saathi is just one 
example of a social enterprise that 
makes “eco-friendly (menstrual) 
hygiene 
products.” 
“Founded 
by graduates from MIT (U.S.), 
Harvard and Nirma,” Saathi 
has developed an innovative 
method of using banana fiber 
to create biodegradable pads. 
According to Saathi’s website, 
the remnants of the banana trees 
leftover from the pad production 
process “can be fermented and 
used as an organic fertilizer” to 
grow crops that nourish entire 
communities. 
Furthermore, 
Jayaashree Enterprises is also 
proving the power of periods 
through the development of 
a 
low-cost, 
sanitary 
napkin 
making machine. By training 
women 
in 
low-income 
and 
remote communities on how to 
mass produce the pads using 
their 
machines, 
Jayaashree 
Enterprises 
empowers 
them 
to sell the pads and become 
breadwinners for their families. 
In addition, innovating plant-

based 
menstrual 
hygiene 
products can go a step further 
and 
produce 
electricity 
through 
anaerobic 
digestion, 
which is the process by which 
energy is generated through 
the breakdown of plant-based 
material under intense heat by 
bacteria. With the help of this 
technology, remnants from the 
production of plant-based pads, 
or even the discarded pads 
themselves, could fuel a digester 
and produce electricity. With the 
potential to nourish crops, create 
jobs and power communities, 
there is no denying the power of 
menstruation.
On the same note, there is also 
no denying that menstrual health 
is a critical issue. No menstruator 
— regardless of how they identify 
— should have to choose between 
purchasing menstrual hygiene 
products or putting food on the 
table. Devastating barriers to 
menstrual health, such as period 
poverty, deserve to be criticized. 
However, periods are not the 
problem. Menstruation does not 
deserve the social stigma that 
surrounds it. Furthermore, we 
should not dismiss the fact that 
menstruation can be a physically 
painful process. I am not arguing 
that all menstruators should 
learn to fully love their periods. 
I am arguing that menstruators 
should not learn to simply 
hate their periods because of 
how society stigmatizes them. 
Luckily, there are organizations 
and 
individuals 
on 
campus 
and beyond working to combat 
barriers to menstrual health 
through research and grassroots 
organizing. However, we can’t 
forget 
the 
reason 
barriers 
to menstrual health remain 
today largely stems from the 
social stigma that forced many 
menstruators and policy makers 
to remain silent on the topic. 
Combating 
this 
stigma 
will 
require shifting our perception 
of periods from a problem to one 
of empowerment. Menstruation 
holds vast potential to improve 
society 
whether 
through 
diagnostics, 
job 
creation, 
compost or energy. Even if none 
of these public health innovations 
were to exist, periods do not 
deserve to be stigmatized. At 
the end of the day, menstruation 
is a natural process — just as 
natural as experiencing nature 
on a mountain climb. As students 
and 
community 
members, 
our 
support 
for 
innovation 
in 
menstrual 
health 
will 
transform society’s perception 
of 
menstruation, 
but 
more 
importantly, it will normalize 
the discussion of menstruation. 
Your support can take many 
forms, including joining existing 
menstrual health initiatives and 
start-ups or developing your own 
project. Regardless of how you 
show your support, every step 
in solidarity against menstrual 
stigma 
can 
help 
normalize 
this natural process. It’s time 
for menstruation to transcend 
society’s limited perspective. 
Yes, I menstruate. What’s your 
superpower?

Eliminating menstrual 

stigma will require 

transforming our view 

of periods themselves

n the last few weeks, there’s 
been an appropriate uproar in 
reaction to President Donald 
Trump’s misguided decision to 
withdraw 
American 
military 
personnel from Syria. After years 
of combating the Islamic State 
and fulfilling our promise to the 
Kurdish people in the region, the 
president engaged in the same 
failed duck-and-run Middle East 
policy that has failed in the past 
few years. It is a decision that has 
rightfully been condemned by 
Republicans and Democrats and 
should be reversed before it’s too 
late.
Yet, a recognition of Turkey’s 
newly 
revealed 
true 
colors 
has ultimately been lost amid 
considerations of the current state 
of affairs in the conflict-filled 
corridor of northeastern Syria. 
Often considered a long-time ally of 
the U.S., Turkey and its President 
Recep Tayyip Erdogan were eager 
to cross the Syrian border and 
begin to sow chaos at the whim of 
Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
Amid analysis of these new facts 
on the ground, we must reconsider 
American-Turkish relations and 
where the two countries truly 
stand today.
Toward the beginning of the 
Cold War and with the creation of 
the Marshall Plan, U.S. President 
Harry Truman offered military 
and 
economic 
assistance 
to 
Turkey, as well as other countries 
that America saw as being at 
risk of falling behind the Iron 
Curtain. In 1952, Turkey was voted 
into the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization to further protect 
it from Soviet interference. At 
the time, it appeared that once 
Turkey had entered NATO, it 
would operate as NATO states did: 
Turkey would support the will of 
the U.S. and the West in rhetoric 
and policy, and remain a loyal ally.
For much of the next few 
decades, Turkey did just that. 
For instance, Turkey provided 

logistical support to the U.S. in 
their military efforts during the 
Gulf War. In a region that has been 
among the most unstable in the 
world, Turkey served as a model 
of consistency and Western-style 
democracy, which a previous 
defense chief in Ankara once called 
a “universal value.” 
In the last few years, however, 
Turkey has failed to live up to its 
purported code of ethics. For two 
years, Erdogan kept Turkey under 
a national state of emergency, in 
which the military took control of 
the state, and human rights abuses 
were rampant. Dissidents were 
jailed and anyone deemed hostile 
to Erdogan and his rule were 
censored, or worse, after a failed 
coup against the president. The 
state of emergency ended in July 
2018, but the government has not 
changed its ways. A 2018 report by 
the U.S. State Department detailed 
the ongoing issues in Turkey 
with regard to their treatment of 
political dissent, and it painted a 
bleak picture for a country that 
was once seemingly a home for 
democratic values.
Erdogan’s totalitarian, abusive 
leadership has also created direct 
issues with the U.S. In 2016, 
Turkish 
authorities 
arrested 
American Pastor Andrew Brunson 
on charges of espionage and for 
allegedly playing a role in a failed 
coup in July. Just last October, 
Brunson was released from prison 
and allowed to return to the 
U.S. In efforts to free Brunson, 
Trump 
threatened 
sanctions 
against 
Turkey. 
Eventually, 
Turkey obliged and sent Brunson 
home. This exchange was just one 
instance in which the U.S. and 
Turkey have been at odds in the 
last few years.
Erdogan often challenges the 
international order by saying that 
“the world is bigger than five,” 
insinuating that he should have 
influence equal to that of U.N. 
Security Council members. In 

his quest to gain this influence, 
he has been unafraid to befriend 
U.S. opponents. With Turkey 
appearing to get closer to Iran 
and Russia, Ankara is once again 
proving that, when given the 
chance, it will only make life 
harder for U.S. officials in Syria. 
The Kurds — a people whom the 
U.S. had relied on for military 
support against Islamic State 
fighters — are Erdogan’s main 
target due to his claims that they 
have links to opposition forces 
in Turkey. With the U.S. out of 
the picture, Erdogan’s units are 
preparing to carry out attacks 
against these American-friendly 
fighters.
It is time that the U.S. and the 
rest of NATO begin to honestly 
evaluate the actions of Turkey 
and its pivot toward embracing 
forces hostile to the international 
order. While Turkey remained 
an important strategic partner 
for some time, it is now taking 
advantage of its past graces and 
the U.S.’s goodwill. At home, 
Erdogan has consistently failed 
to govern according to the values 
Ankara once claimed to hold dear. 
Abroad, the Turkish government 
has ceased to be an effective and 
loyal ally and has proved that 
Turkey will only look out for its 
own interests.
Such a country is dangerous to 
have as an enemy, but it is arguably 
more frightening to have as an 
ally. If NATO members cannot 
count on their fellow countries 
to promote peace and prosperity, 
who can they confidently trust? It 
is vital that the NATO community 
holds Turkey and its power-
hungry leader accountable and, if 
necessary, provide consequences 
for their behavior. If Ankara and 
Erdogan are to become bigger 
players in global affairs, they 
must play by the rules.

n Oct. 12, 2019, Kenyan 
runner Eliud Kipchoge, 
34, 
entered 
territory 
never 
before 
occupied 
by 
humankind. After one hour, 
59 minutes and 40 seconds of 
impeccable running, Kipchoge 
became the first person to ever 
run the marathon distance of 26.2 
miles in under two hours. This is a 
feat that marathoners worldwide 
have been creeping toward for as 
long as the marathon event has 
existed, but has been considered 
by many prior to this achievement 
to be impossible.
Despite the feat, some still 
believe that a sub-two-hour 
marathon 
is 
out 
of 
reach. 
Kipchoge’s run will not be 
counted as an official world 
record 
by 
the 
International 
Association 
of 
Athletics 
Federations because it was not 
performed 
under 
federation-
approved conditions. Kipchoge’s 
time was clocked at the INEOS 
1:59 
Challenge 
in 
Vienna, 
Austria, an event that was 
specifically-engineered 
for 
the 
Kenyan’s 
solo 
sub-two-
hour attempt and was not an 
IAAF-recognized 
marathon 
competition. 
Furthermore, 
Kipchoge was always flocked by 
a team of pacers who ran at the 
pace necessary for the target 
finishing time and rotated in 
groups onto and off of the course. 
This 
rotation 
was 
another 
deviation from IAAF protocol.
Some 
will 
point 
to 
the 
optimization of conditions as 
grounds for the feat’s illegitimacy. 
The pacers themselves were led 
by a car that projected a laser 
guide onto the road, aligning the 
pacers to optimize aerodynamic 
efficiency for Kipchoge. The date 
was selected by meteorologists 
for ideal weather conditions, 
and Kipchoge ran on a straight 
and flat course wearing newly-
developed Nike ZoomX Vaporfly 
NEXT% 
shoes, 
which 
are 
commercially-unavailable.
However, 
to 
think 
these 
optimized conditions undermine 
the 
accomplishment 
of 
this 
undertaking is to do injustice to 
the unique talents of our species. 
The 
sub-two-hour 
marathon 
is a landmark example of what 
humans are able to do with a 
combination of willpower and 
ingenuity. Everyone involved in 
preparing the event knew the 
time wouldn’t count — what they 
were interested in was seeing if 

the seemingly impossible could be 
accomplished. Getting a person to 
run 26.2 miles as fast as possible 
is a challenge akin to landing 
people on the moon: It requires 
endless practice and discipline 
from those who will physically 
undertake the task, application of 
science and research from experts 
in the field, optimization of all 
controllable factors and perfect 
environmental conditions. We 
all know of Neil Armstrong 
because he was the first person to 
physically set foot on the moon, 
but there was a large team behind 
the Apollo 11 mission that made 
America’s lunar dreams a reality.
Kipchoge is the marathon’s 
Neil Armstrong. As the greatest 
marathoner of all time, holding 
the official world record of 
2:01:39 that was set just one 
year ago, there was no one more 
qualified to attempt the INEOS 
1:59 experiment. Even if his 
1:59:40.12 time does not appear 
in official records books, he will 
be remembered as the man who 
crossed a sacred threshold, and if 
there is anyone in the near future 
who will break 2:00 in official 
conditions, as of now, it is likely 
to be Kipchoge. However, it took 
a large group of dedicated people 
putting their heads together 
toward a common objective to 
accomplish this goal this time 
around.
A roadblock in improving on 
records in athletics is that, with 
every boundary pushed a little 
bit further, we edge closer to the 
unknown limits of what humans 
are physically capable of doing. 
This is where the case of the 
marathon diverges from that of 
the moon landing. Technology 
improves as quickly as human 
minds can innovate, which is quite 
fast, given that manned missions 
to Mars could become a reality 
in the next couple of decades. 
Humans’ physical evolution is 
significantly slower than this. It 
is unlikely that marathon runners 
have genetically evolved at all 
since 1896, when the marathon 
was held at the first modern 
Olympiad and the gold medalist 
ran a time of 2:58:50.
Despite this, marathon times 
have dropped significantly since 
then. If people’s physical talents 
are not getting any better, then 
there must be other factors in 
play with regard to dropping 
times. A lot of the heat directed 
at Kipchoge’s accomplishment 

is related to the shoes he wore 
during the event, which some 
say may contain elements that 
have 
spring-like 
properties, 
though Nike states that the 
purpose of these elements is only 
to distribute forces that may be 
felt by the wearer. Criticizing 
scientific 
and 
technological 
advances 
for 
improved 
race 
times, however, is a fruitless 
endeavor. A look at the fastest 
official 
marathon 
times 
for 
every elite male marathoner in 
the world shows that the top 14 
marathoners ever clocked their 
fastest times after 2011. There is 
not a single time before 2003 in 
the top 100.
Runners’ 
genetics 
have 
not evolved since 2003, but 
technology, training and sports 
science have. Shoes have become 
lighter and more aerodynamic, 
training 
and 
rest 
schedules 
have been optimized, recovery 
techniques have been improved 
upon and sleep and nutritional 
science is brimming with new 
findings. Science and technology 
have been used to bring out the 
most in how quickly human 
beings are able to run 26.2 miles.
This is what makes Kipchoge’s 
sub-two-hour 
marathon 
so 
exciting. The feat demonstrates 
that humans — with the power 
of what we know and what 
we can create — can continue 
to unearth potential in what 
we are physically able to do. 
Accomplishments 
in 
modern 
athletics are every bit as much 
a product of human intellect as 
they are of human physiology. 
Kipchoge’s 
achievement 
results 
from 
a 
cooperative 
effort between the world-class 
athletes who paced him, the 
scientists who determined the 
best running configurations and 
weather conditions for the event, 
the researchers who developed 
Kipchoge’s shoes, the trainers 
who planned Kipchoge’s training 
and the extraordinary physical 
gifts of Kipchoge himself.
The next step is for someone to 
cross the finish line of an official 
marathon in under two hours. As 
our understanding of training, 
recovery and footwear continues 
to advance, I have no doubt it will 
be done in the future. When it is, 
it will be another opportunity for 
us to see what we are made of.

In the modern movement of “wokeness,” it’s 
easy to forget all the issues and movements phasing 
in and out of social media. If you already forgot 
about the #MeToo movement, it found its way 
back into relevancy in “The Morning Show.” News 
anchorman Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell, “Welcome 
to Marwen”) gets fired from popular news show 
“The Morning Show” for sexual misconduct, 
and he has to learn to deal with his tarnished 
reputation while the cast and crew are left to pick 
up the pieces. He leaves behind his co-star of 15 
years in Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston, “Murder 
Mystery”) to take on the responsibilities of hosting 
the show, as the network threatens to replace her 
with someone newer and fresher. The show dives 
deep into the broader implications of these issues 
and smoothy diverts becoming preachy and self-
righteous.
The way the show portrays the cold, bureaucratic 
side of the news industry is the most entertaining 
aspect of the show. It’s often a backdrop against the 
very human consequences that sexual misconduct 
cases cause, but nonetheless revealing in how 
disgustingly frigid and unsympathetic industry 
can be. The network executive, Cory Ellison (Billy 
Crudup, “Where’d You Go, Bernadette”), is clearly 
unfazed by Kessler’s incident and speaks in terms 
of show ratings and how the network can spin the 
incident in their favor. Against Aniston’s hard-
hitting and soulful performance, Crudup performs 
an 
almost 
opposite 
performance, 
perfectly 
embodying the robotic, heartless businessman 
he portrays. They resonate off each other as two 
sides of the same coin — both willing to sacrifice 
whatever it takes to achieve their goals, but 
emotionally affected by Kessler’s crime in different 
ways.
Aniston and Ellison weren’t the only ones who 
stood out in a cast of Hollywood icons. Reese 
Witherspoon (“Big Little Lies”), who plays field 
journalist Bradley Jackson, proves herself yet 
again as one of the most versatile actresses of our 
generation in a scene where she melts down while 

reporting for a protest. Apart from the money grab, 
there’s a reason why producers try to string along 
as many stars as they can, and this series certainly 
proved that these stars have something more than 
good publicity to offer.
“The Morning Show” also gets into the longevity 
of sexual misconduct cases, and how they don’t just 
disappear after the news cycle forgets about it. Alex 
Levy grapples with being left in the dark about 
the issue for so long, then immediately having to 
address it in public. She is constantly addressed in 
terms of the incident, asked if she’s okay and slowly 
being phased out by the network as they try to find 
another female face for the show. At the same time, 
Kessler, fueled by his own ego, wonders if he should 
set out to prove his self-proclaimed innocence as 
he continuously screams, “I didn’t rape anybody” 
and “they liked it.” He broods around his house 
and stews in his own anger as the truth about the 
details of his sexual misconduct case is slowly 
revealed to us.
The perspective of the perpetrator and the 
periphery is one we are hardly given when it comes 
to sexual misconduct cases, and “The Morning 
Show” goes into realistic depth with it. It shows 
us exactly how far-reaching these issues can get, 
particularly in the entertainment industry where 
everything is easily publicized. For one of the first 
shows of the new Apple TV+ streaming service, 
it does an impressive job, which isn’t all that 
surprising given the amount of stars attached. If 
they pump out some juicy content adjacent to this, 
Apple could have the potential to play ball in the 
big leagues and make the company an even bigger 
empire than it already is.

TV REVIEW
WORLD MUSIC COLUMN

While his musical career (especially 
outside the Francophone world) has largely 
been overshadowed by that of his brilliant 
wife Françoise Hardy, Jacques Dutronc’s 
pair of self-titled albums released in the 
1960s hold up unexpectedly well decades 
later. Elements of the garage rock coming 
out of the U.S. during his teenage years 
are abound, these aspects mixing with the 
sounds and attitudes of yé-yé, the loose, 
bubbly style of French pop which originated 
years earlier.
Another crucial part of the songwriting 
on the two self-titled albums (released in 
1966 and 1968) were the lyrics. Jacques 
Lanzmann — a renaissance man novelist, 
journalist and songwriter who at the time 
when he met Dutronc was the editor of 
the raunchy men’s magazine Lui — helped 
infuse 
Dutronc’s 
already 
suave 
sound 
with a distinctly French sense of sarcasm 
and aloofness. With Lanzmann’s help, 
Dutronc’s music gained a propensity to 
ridicule everything and everyone popular 
at the time. 
One of the early and most enduring hits 
of this partnership was the 1966 single “Et 
moi, et moi, et moi” (“And I, and I, and I”), 
a simple garage rock track with a heavy 
dose of cynicism in its lyrics. He sings, 
“Cinquante millions de vietnamiens \ Et 
moi, et moi, et moi \ Le dimanche à la \ 
chasse au lapin \ Avec mon fusil, je suis le 
roi \J’y pense et puis j’oublie C’est la vie, 
c’est la vie” (“Fifty million Vietnamese \ 
and me, and me, and me \ hunting rabbits 
on Sundays \ with my rifle, I am the king 
\ I think of it and then I forget it \ That’s 
life, that’s life”). Along with this reference 
to the Vietnam war, Dutronc refers to the 
plight of hundreds of millions around the 
world while contrasting them with the 
petty worries of his selfish Frenchman and 
his headaches and his “habits and tics in his 
little goose feather bed.” 
The cover of the 1968 self-titled features 
Dutronc suited up, snarling off-camera 

with a cigar sandwiched between his teeth. 
It is a fitting emblem to the type of chic he 
represented as well as the music contained 
within the album. While officially titled 
Jacques Dutronc, it is perhaps even more 
known as “Il est cinq heures” after both 
its as well as Dutronc as a whole’s biggest 
hit “Il est cinq heures, Paris s’éveille” (“It’s 
five o’clock, Paris awakens”). Considered by 
many to be one of the best French-language 
singles ever released, it paints a portrait of 
Paris in the early morning hours, an idea 
that has been explored heavily by countless 
artists, musicians and writers throughout 
the decade. In a fashion reminiscent of 
the poet Baudelaire, he looks into the 
less postcard-worthy scenes, describing, 
“Les stripteaseuses sont rhabillées \ Les 
traversins sont écrasés \ Les amoureux 
sont fatigués” (“The strippers are dressed 
again, the bolsters are crushed, the lovers 
are tired”) and calling the famous Paris-
Montparnasse station “nothing more than 
a carcass.” 
Similarly, Dutronc satirizes the hippie 
lifestyle of the time in “Hippie Hippie 
Hourrah,” declaring, “J’aime les fleurs et 
la fumée \ Je ne suis plus un revolté \ Les 
Beatniks c’est dépassé \ Maintenant le 
monde il faut l’aimer” (“I love the flowers 
and smoke \ I’m not a rebel anymore \ The 
beatniks are passé \ Now we must love the 
world”). Dutronc’s voice is highly Dylan-
esque (with slightly better melodic talents) 
and pairs well with these type of more 
straightforward garage rockers, but also 
shines in more earnest pieces such as “Les 
rois de la réforme,” an anti-war track in 
which he converses with Monsieurs Calvin 
(John Calvin), Luther (Martin Luther), 
Luthin and Calvaire about giving up the 
uniform. 
As Jeremy Allen of The Guardian notes, 
Dutronc’s “cigar-chomping visage is the 
true embodiment of French pop at its most 
chic.” While he continued to release music 
as he transitioned his career into acting, 
none of them reached the heights that 
his first two did with their (rather rare) 
combination of witty cynicism and youthful 
energy.

On the chicness of Dutranc

SAYAN GHOSH
Daily World Music Columnist

Jesus is King is here, and it is … something. 
It’s hard to put into words. We had been waiting for almost a 
year for Kanye to finally release Yandhi — his leak-prone, now-
unreleased album — when it was suddenly replaced by Jesus is 
King in late August. The hype for Yandhi was palpable. Based on 
the leaks, Yandhi was set to be a mixture between the menagerie-
like beats of the ever-polarizing The Life of Pablo and 
the cracked-out lyricism of the oft-reviled Ye, but with 
even zanier production and feature credits. Instead 
of Metro Boomin and Kid Cudi, we would have gotten 
Ronny J and XXXTentacion. However, Jesus is King is 
unlike anything we’ve heard from Kanye. 
Kanye has toyed with the idea of gospel music 
before, most recently on The Life of Pablo, but on his 
most recent release, he attempts to take a full plunge. 
He forgoes all cursing, replacing it with near-comical 
amounts of non-stop Jesus talk. It’s often hard to tell 
if he means what he says. Sometimes, it’s earnest. 
On “Closed on Sunday,” he prays to God to give him 
the strength to protect and preserve his family and 
himself from the devil, rapping, “I pray to God that 
He’ll strengthen my hand / They will think twice 
steppin’ on my land … Try me and you will see I ain’t 
playin’ / Now back up off my family, move your hands.” 
Sure, he puts a little hip-hop twist on it, but it’s mostly 
like gospel music. Earlier though, on the same song, 
Kanye sings, presumably to his wife, “Closed on 
Sunday, you my Chick-Fil-A / You my number one, 
with the lemonade.” Now this is a little strange: He’s 
comparing his wife to Chick-Fil-A and states that she’s “closed 
on Sunday” and then goes on to say that she’s the only one for 
him by comparing her to the famous number one meal (with 
the lemonade) from the fast-food chain. This head-scratching 
flip-flopping trend between sanctity and absurdity continues 
throughout the album.
The production, on the other hand, is mostly enjoyable, but as 
the omnipresent beatsmith Kenny Beats said, “I feel like the 808s 
on Jesus is King could have used some premarital sex.” Not only 
is that hilarious, but it’s also true. The production sounds great, 
even excellent at times, but it’s missing something — a certain 
oomph. With production credits from new schoolers like Pi’erre 
Bourne and FNZ and legends like Timbaland and West himself, 
it’d be reasonable to expect some earth-rattling bass and mind-
altering samples, but they never come, lest we forget that this is 
a gospel album.
Jesus is King does have a few great moments among the 
bizarre and disappointing. Clipse join forces for the first time 
in six years on “Use This Gospel,” Kenny G lays down a bitchin’ 
saxophone solo also on the same song, Kanye returns to the 
aggression and intensity of old on “Follow God,” Pi’erre Bourne 
busts out a pair of speaker-busting synth lines and drops his 
signature tags not once, but twice on “On God.” Sadly, the great 
moments are few and far between and are weighed down by 
questionable decisions, and unfortunately, that does not make 
for a good album.
— Jim Wilson, Daily Arts Writer
Kanye went through all the effort of cutting out cursing on 
Jesus Is King, so I figure it’s only right that I do the same. And 
on that note: Holy crap, the album actually came, and it feels 
legendary. Kanye West is in a special class of fabled musical 
figures — somewhere between Kendrick Lamar and Frank Ocean 
— whose mere hint of new music makes tidal waves within the 

sea that is the hip-hop community. The holy water is finally 
raining down.
Jesus Is King is not a rap album with religious influence — this 
is straight-up Christian music. There are elements of electronic 
and soul in addition to contemporary gospel, but what strings 
it all together is Christianity, not hip hop. Of course, this 
makes it a little less palatable for the not-so-Christian. And as 
Christian as it is, there is still less Christ and more Kanye (to 
nobody’s surprise). It’s certainly not a gospel album by anyone’s 
definition other than Kanye’s. But I’ll get there.
Religious or not, there’s no denying that this album opens 
with ferocity. Kanye really nailed the “King” part of Jesus Is 
King, because the Sunday Service choir is at its swankiest on 

“Every Hour,” and the roaring thunderclap percussion of 
“Selah” invokes a glorious sense of a higher power.
And that’s about where the quality in this album ends for 
the most part. There are some 
other high points — “Follow 
God” features a classic kickin’ 
Kanye beat, and “On God” has 
that Graduation-esque-gonna-
slap-in-the-stadium type of 
effervescence. But both songs 
clock in at about two minutes, 
a twisted tease of what could 
have been. The only other cool 
thing is “Use This Gospel,” 
which reunites Pusha T and 
No Malice of Clipse for the 
first time in God knows how 
long (OK, six years, but that’s 
an eternity in popular music 
now). Four minutes of music 
that feels like “the old Kanye” 
and a collective 16 bars from 
Clipse are not enough to 
celebrate.
So where does this album 
fail? Does Christianity mess 
with Kanye’s creative ju-ju? 
Definitely not — from “Jesus 
Walks” to “Ultralight Beam,” 
God has been the backbone 
of some of Kanye’s greatest 
and most inspired music. But 
nothing on Jesus Is King feels 

particularly great or inspired. By the time I got to “God Is,” 
I felt alienated by the subject matter: It’s less gospel and more 
unchecked ego, something I should have realized on “Selah” 
when he started comparing his public persecution to that of Jesus 
and Noah. I do admire Kanye’s gruff and breathy singing on the 
track, though. It feels very performative, like a pastor belting at 
a sermon.
It’s too bad that not even the production can make up for the 
album’s failings. Ever since The Life of Pablo, Kanye has embraced 
a minimalist production style that’s all about giving the music 
room to breathe. This style isn’t necessarily bad — it worked on 
Pablo, then again (to a lesser degree) on Ye, and other artists are 
doing it better (see Billie Eilish’s latest) — but it’s not working for 
Kanye in 2019. Instrumentally, tracks like “Closed On 
Sunday,” “Everything We Need” and “Hands On” are 
profoundly uninteresting. “Water” breaks from this 
trend, and is kinda cool in a surrealist way, but it goes 
nowhere. It just makes me want to listen to Kendrick 
Lamar’s far more interesting “For Sale? - Interlude.”
It doesn’t have to be this way. I won’t debate that the 
writing is genuinely awful on this project — “Closed 
on Sunday” is a bigger lyrical embarrassment than last 
year’s “Lift Yourself.” It doesn’t sound good even if you 
care about Kanye; if anything, that makes it worse. This 
is writing that sounds good only if you are Kanye. But 
he does have a history of winning over listeners even 
when his writing is alienating. The real patrician music 
snobs will acknowledge that My Beautiful Dark Twisted 
Fantasy is Kanye’s greatest album for it’s overproduced 
opulence, despite the writing being condemned as “only 
good if you care about Kanye.” So if people who can’t 
resonate with the lyricism on Fantasy in a genre that is 
all about lyricism can still laud it as one of the greatest 
albums of all time, then there’s no reason Jesus Is King 
couldn’t achieve the same. But even if the production 
was creative and unique and exciting for any longer 
than two minutes, I’m still certain that I wouldn’t want to hear 
Kanye say the word “Jesus” ever again.

Halloween is one of the biggest and most festive holidays in Ann Arbor. One 
of the coolest parts of Halloween by far are the costumes — whether they’re 
made last minute or whether they‘ve been in the works for an entire year. We 
went out during Halloween festivities to document the goriest, cutest and most 
interesting costumes. 

Residential Ann Arbor
Nostalgia sets in when seeing children prancing around in their 
costumes, buckets full of candy swinging. You can’t help but smile. 
Seven-year-old Conner dressed as a member of the SWAT team. When 
asked why he chose his costume he responded cooley, “because I like it.” 
Love the decisiveness, Conner.
While Avery, who is five and a half years old, opted for a softer look, as 
she sported her Elsa costume from “Frozen.” 

“I like Elsa! She makes ice sometimes!” she exclaimed. She cannot wait 
for the new Frozen movie to come out in theatres.
Five-and-a-half-year-old Abe had opted to mesh two of his favorite 
things together into one costume. “I chose my costume because I like 
Pokemon a lot ... and also vampires,” Abe explained. 
Asher, who is four years old, dressed up as one of my favorite animals, a 
gecko. He chose this animal “because (he) like(s) the golden (shine on his 
costume).” A fashion icon in the making. 
When we asked seven-year-old Matilda, who first introduced herself 

in her scariest monster voice, why she had chosen her costume, she 
firmly responded, “Because Marcel Marceau.” Seems as good a reason as 
anything.
Nolan chose to dress up as Scream “Because (he) watched the movie,” 
while Sean went for the hockey-player look “because he likes to play 
hockey.” It’s a very bold choice to dress up as yourself, and we applaud that. 
Hazel and Fiona, both 10 years old, strutted out in their best zombie 
bride costumes.
“We wanted to be something zombie, and we wanted to be matching 
costumes,” Hazel explained.
10-year-old Amelia went for a costume that would please both her and 
her mother.
“I’m a ’70s hippie girl. My mom rejected all my other costumes, and I 
really liked this costume,” she explained.

Lutherween
The Luther Co-op throws an iconic annual Halloween party, so we 
decided to crash it. 
School of Music, Theatre & Dance junior Archie Magnus and Literature, 
Science & Arts junior Julia Silverman were sporting one of the best 
couple’s costumes at Lutherween. A party widely regarded as one of the 
biggest Halloween parties in Ann Arbor, Lutherween pulls in an expected 
attendance of over a thousand people. Julia was decked out in magician 
attire and Archie (to quote them directly) was a “sexy bunny.” The 
inspiration for this costume was derived from a lot of internet searching. 
“We felt a little discouraged until we found our way here. This was the 
simplest and most budget-worthy costume,” said Magnus. “And funny! 
It’s funny and good!” said Silverman. “Yeah, we’re pretty funny people,” 
agreed Magnus. 
“If you count the trip we took to party city, it took us an hour to put this 
all together,” Magnus said. Besides, of course, for Silverman’s shoes. To 
which she eagerly cheered before departing “Wait, but my shoes are from 
Chicago — Chicago!” 
During her final semester in the School of Social Work, graduate student 
Emily Piellusch decided that now was as good a time as any to go all out for 
Halloween. 
“I’m a deathly/skeletory type of showgirl. I know skeletory isn’t a word, 
by the way,” Piellusch said. She got the idea from looking at an Instagram 
page from Brooklyn Club “Haus of Yes.” She had been picking up the 
various costume pieces for a couple of weeks until she “finally did all the 
crafting this afternoon in about an hour and a half.” This was a pretty 
fantastic costume for an hour and a halfs worth of work, if you ask me. 
Congratulations Emily, you’re killing it.
LSA senior Leah Hardy and Engineering junior Jacob Todd were also 

sporting an adorable couple’s costume.
“We wanted a couple’s costume and we have a cat, so we figured Team 
Rocket would be perfect for us,” Hardy said. “It was her idea,” Todd added. 
When I asked Todd if he liked Hardy’s idea he said, “I mean yeah, I 
was excited about it, I’m just not a very good planner. This is our first 
couple’s costume. Last year we went to Halloween together, but we weren’t 
coordinated.” I asked them how long they had been together and Hardy 
said, “A year yesterday!” Daily photographer Keemya and I exploded in 
congratulations before sending them on their way. 
LSA senior Miranda Schaffer was wearing full Britney Spears attire. 
She looked as though she had walked straight out of the iconic “Oops!... I 
Did It Again” music video. 
When asked what inspired this years Britney Spears costume, she said: 
“Last year’s Britney Spears costume! Last year’s Britney look was ‘Hit 
Me Baby One More Time’ Britney, and this look is ‘Oops!... I Did It Again’ 
Britney. Get it?” She thought of the idea for this costume 364 days ago when 
she “enjoyed being Britney so much.” She felt like it was her “true calling.” 
Schaffer ordered the red jumpsuit on Amazon two months ago because 
she “went to the Halloween store and some buffoon tried to pawn me off 
red leggings and a red t-shirt and say that was good enough to be Britney 
Spears and I said ‘No, no, no!’ So I went on Amazon and ordered it that 
night. A beautiful metallic jumpsuit.”
LSA senior Melissa Newman chose to be Lord Farquad from the movie 
“Shrek” for Halloween this year. 
“I’m obsessed with Shrek. Obsessed. Last year I was Shrek for Halloween. 
I think it is the best movie on the planet.” According to Newman, her Lord 
Farquad look had gotten a great deal of positive reactions that evening. 
“People can immediately tell who I am. I entirely self-made this 
costume, so I am pretty happy anyone is able to tell what it is.” It took her 
about four hours to make the costume, yet she had been thinking about it 
since last year’s Lutherween. She was quite excited that her love of Shrek 
lived to see another year.

Theatre party
What better place to get pictures of Halloween costumes than from 
people who dress up in costume for a living?
SMTD & Business junior Nate Pierstorff took us back in time with 
his Virgil costume from the iconic 2008 Disney Channel original movie 
“Minutemen.” 
“In 2017, my freshman year, the university installed this new statue by 
the CCTC bus stop called ‘portal to a new’ something, and it looks like 
the portal that they come out of,” Pierstorff said. “And I was just like, ‘You 
know, they gave me a portal, I’m giving them ‘Minutemen.’’ Pierstorff said 
he did a full photoshoot in the portal.
He was so dedicated to bit that even his phone background was the 
movie cover. 

“I like dropping in to different costumes. Like a little DIY masterclass 
that we give to people.”
LSA sophomore Kaitlyn Tom and LSA freshman Rex Rubinstein put a 
fun spin on their classic costume. Their original idea to dress up as bears 
with “Directed by James Harbaugh” written on their chests as an ode 
to their participation in MUSKET’S “Bare: A Pop Opera” (November 
22nd-24th) fell through. But they found the next best thing: the Big Bad 
Wolf and (sexy) Little Red Riding Hood.

Rubinstein was in head-to-toe black and red, with a little red cape, fluffy 
tutu and even sexy knee socks.
“My costume was very, very last minute — I did a quick makeup look in 
20 minutes and just put ears on and a tail,” Tom said. “I also had a boa to 
add a little sparkle which I thought made my costume super cute — thanks 
Rex!”
This year, Tom has embraced the Halloween spirit.
“I actually used to hate Halloween because I felt there was pressure as 
a girl to look a certain way,” Tom said. “But in the past couple years, I’ve 
begun looking forward to Halloween because it’s time I get to spend with 
my friends and wear silly costumes like my wolf costume.”
SMTD junior Ryan Moore lives for Halloween. Throughout 
Halloweekend, he progressed through Lady Gaga’s iconic looks from the 
Met Gala.
“I was purely inspired by my love of Lady Gaga,” Moore said. “I also am 
a huge fan of the camp aesthetic so when I saw her look for the Camp Gala I 
knew immediately it was something I needed replicate somehow.”
Moore took Halloween costumes to the next level. Splurging on a 
custom-made wig from Wigs by Vanity, it’s now his prized possession. 
“I googled looking for a pink satin slip dress, which is a lot more difficult 
to find than I thought it would be so I settled for a dress that was close 
enough. I like that it had a slit in it because it allowed for people to see my 
eight-inch heels!” Moore said. 
He continued, “I looked on Amazon for black oversized sunglasses, a 
necklace and an old fashion brick phone — I thought the blow up version 
was really campy.”
As a theatre fanatic and a costume designer, Halloween is Moore’s 
wonderland.
“Halloween is my favorite holiday,” Moore said. “I love dressing up all 
year round and the week of Halloween is the one week of the year that I 
can dress in costume and it’s considered normal, and everyone else is in 
costume too. I love the creativity that Halloween inspires.”

COLLEGE PARK — It took all of 11 

seconds.

That’s how much time elapsed 

while freshman Giles Jackson fielded 

the opening kickoff on Saturday, 

offered one juke, burst past the 

kicker’s diving grasp and into the end 

zone. If there was any doubt about 

whether the Michigan football team 

(7-2 overall, 4-2 Big Ten) would take 

care of a hapless Maryland squad; 

any doubt the Wolverines could 

re-focus after last week’s big win; any 

doubt that there could be such a thing 

as an easy road win in the Big Ten — it 

was all squashed.

In 11 seconds. 

“We always try to start the 

game off fast, and that was a great 

emphasis coming into this game on 

the road,” said senior quarterback 

Shea Patterson. “It was cool to see 

him take off and kind of set the tone 

for the game.”

Jackson set the tone and nailed the 

coffin in one fell swoop.

Michigan 
continued the final 

3,049 seconds down the same path 

of inevitability, taking care of the 

Terrapins (3-6, 1-5), 38-7, winning 

with as much ease as it has all year. 

Despite 
the 
comfort 
of 
the 

scoreboard, the Wolverines’ offense 

sputtered out of the gate. A week after 

piling up 300-plus rushing yards and 

45 points against Notre Dame, the 

offense mustered just 49 yards on its 

first three drives, with the lone score 

coming via field position that started 

in Terrapins territory. 

But 
it 
didn’t 
take 
long 
for 

Michigan’s offense to get the gears 

turning again, aided by a fake punt 

in the middle of the second quarter, 

in which Michael Barrett scampered 

for 14 yards off a direct snap.

“We’ve practiced it now for several 

weeks,” said Michigan coach Jim 

Harbaugh, of the decision to fake 

the punt. “I was waiting for a fourth-

and-1, fourth-and-2 type of situation 

on our own side. And it was there, so 

we took advantage of the work that 

we had put in.”

From there, it took all of three 

plays — a 51-yard bomb to junior 

receiver Nico Collins, an incomplete 

pass, then an eight-yard rush from 

freshman Zach Charbonnet — to 

extend the lead to 21-0 and firmly 

bury the Terrapins. 

In reality, though, everything 

beyond the opening kickoff served as 

a glorified scrimmage.

Maryland’s offense offered brief 

glimpses 
of 
competence 
early, 

marching into the red zone twice, only 

to leave each time empty-handed. 

The first time, an interception from 

senior safety Josh Metellus halted 

the progress. The second came via 

a missed field goal. The Terrapins 

failed to score on offense — their 

lone points coming via a kick return 

touchdown deep into garbage time.

Junior tight end Nick Eubanks 

capped off a 12-play, 60-yard drive 

in the third quarter with his second 

touchdown grab of the year. Junior 

running back Hassan Haskins found 

the same destiny mere minutes later. 

After its slow start, the offense still 

finished with 331 yards — a near 

even split between passing (176) and 

rushing (155). 

“I thought (offensive coordinator 

Josh Gattis) called a really good 

game today,” Harbaugh said. “It was 

a good mix of the running game. 

The downfield throws were there, 

the RPOs were there and we made 

some plays off of that. ... I thought, 

keep building, keep improving, but 

I feel like it’s going in the ascending 

direction.”

The Wolverines will stride into 

a bye week now at its peak, having 

rattled off two wins by a combined 

62 points. A limping Michigan 

State group now beckons, and this 

Michigan team — suddenly rife with 

confidence — tastes blood in the 

water.

“We thinking about Michigan 

State right now,” Metellus said. 

“We thinking about both of them 

(Michigan State and Ohio State) right 

now, honestly. That’s something, 

being a Michigan Man, you’re always 

thinking about. 

“That game-planning starts later 

today.”

OLLEGE PARK — There 
is nothing about Satur-
day’s Michigan football 
game that, 
when the 
season ends, 
will qualify as 
particularly 
memorable.
A two-loss 
Wolverines 
played a 
Maryland 
team that 
likely won’t 
qualify for a 
bowl. Michigan won, 38-7, in a 
game it was supposed to win by 
something like that score. The 
outcome was never in doubt. A 
healthy percentage of the fans 
in College Park wore maize 
and blue, and then went home 
happy.
Really, the only way this 
could have qualified as memo-
rable would be if the Wolver-
ines had lost.
Michigan is out of conten-
tion for the College Football 
Playoff and the Big Ten. If you 
read this paper, or any other 
outlet covering the Wolverines, 
you’ve read about 50 variants 
of that sentence in the last two 
weeks. There are four weeks 
left in the regular season and 
one way to make the season, 
unequivocally, a success. Josh 
Uche laid it out pretty well.
“We thinking about Michi-
gan State right now,” the senior 
linebacker said after Saturday’s 
game. “We thinking about both 
of them (Michigan State and 
Ohio State) right now, hon-
estly. That’s something, being 
a Michigan Man, you always 
thinking about. 
“That game-planning starts 
later today.”
It’s pretty easy at this point. 
Win those two games and the 
narrative around this program 
shifts. No longer is Jim Har-
baugh the coach who can’t beat 
his rivals. No longer is Michi-
gan the program that can’t get 
over the hump. No longer is 

anyone going into 2020 with 
apprehension.
Lose both — or go one-for-
two — and it’s the same thing 
as ever.
These will always be the 
games that define success for 
the program. 
Last year, when Michigan 
went to East Lansing and beat 
Michigan State, 21-7, Harbaugh 
teared up in the locker room. 
That’s how much it meant to 
him.
Now imagine what it would 
mean to win both rivalry 
games.
Michigan will be prohibitive 
favorites against the Spartans, 
a program currently in disar-
ray. Mark Dantonio’s team has 
scored 17 points in its last three 
games and holds a 4-4 record. 

Rumors have abounded about 
Dantonio’s job status. The Wol-
verines’ defense 
is one of the best 
in the country. 
The math works 
itself out pretty 
well.
As much as 
this matchup 
has a tendency 
to go haywire, 
Michigan may 
have a chance 
to put a nail in 
Dantonio’s coffin. It’s hard to 
imagine the Wolverines won’t 
be eager to take it, especially 
coming off a bye.
“This week, we just gotta get 
ready, take care of our bodies,” 
said junior wideout Nico Col-
lins. “We got off and we just 

get ready for Michigan State 
the following week.”
Ohio State is 
a tougher ask, 
and it’ll come 
after a road trip 
to Indiana that 
doubles as a 
trap game. That 
doesn’t make it 
impossible to 
win. Nor does 
it diminish its 
importance.
Even though 
the Buckeyes haven’t taken the 
step back people envisioned 
under new coach Ryan Day, 
that opportunity is still there. 
Two years ago in Ann Arbor, 
the Wolverines pushed them 
to the brink despite a notable 
talent gap in one of the best 

coaching performances of the 
Harbaugh era.
There’s no reason that can’t 
happen again. And there’s no 
reason Michigan — which has 
gotten better as the season has 
gone on, particularly over the 
last 10 quarters — can’t finish 
the job this time.
Impossible as that seemed in 
late September, when Josh Gat-
tis’ offense was on the brink of 
implosion, the Wolverines have 
turned things around.
The offense has found an 
identity, mixing in Harbaugh 
and offensive line coach Ed 
Warinner’s plays with Gat-
tis’ looks. Senior quarterback 
Shea Patterson is healthy after 
struggling through the early 
part of the season. The 31 
points the Wolverines’ offense 

scored against the Terrapins 
felt almost lazy a week after 
they dropped 45 on Notre 
Dame.
“I think collectively as a 
group, we’re playing at our 
highest level,” Patterson said. 
“There was a couple three-
and-outs on the offensive side 
of the ball, and we kind of want 
to stay away from that to put 
our defense in better positions. 
But as a group right now, we’re 
kind of hitting our stride.”
As for the defense, it ranks 
third in SP+, with few linger-
ing questions. It’s par for the 
course under Don Brown.
That could all fall apart 
when things get real, espe-
cially against Ohio State. Last 
year, the Wolverines came into 
Columbus and looked unpre-
pared with a Playoff berth on 
the line.
If that happens this year, it 
won’t be viewed as the same 
kind of disaster, because this 
Michigan team will be playing 
only for itself. The season will 
be a relative footnote. Every-
one’s eyes will turn towards 
2020.
But if Michigan can pull it 
off? If it can beat Michigan 
State and Ohio State twice 
in three weeks, notch Har-
baugh’s first win against 
the Buckeyes and polish off 
a 10-win season that looked 
dead to rights after three 
games?
Well, then, who cares about 
the Playoff, or the Big Ten? 
Who cares about what Har-
baugh hasn’t done or what the 
program hasn’t been? This 
season is the best of the Har-
baugh era anyway.
That’s the chance in front 
of the Wolverines right now. 
Our memory of this season 
will depend on whether they 
take it.

Four weeks to make the season

The good, the bad and the ugly: Maryland

COLLEGE 
PARK 
—
The official attendance at 
Maryland Stadium was 40,071 
fans, but the eye test seemed to 
contradict that. Opposite the 
press box, the stands were full 
of maize and blue. This was 
the Terrapins’ homecoming, 
but few of their own fans 
showed up.
And honestly, who could 
blame them? The Nationals’ 
World Series parade was at the 
same time, 30 minutes down 
the Beltway. Few Maryland 
fans thought their team would 
beat Michigan, even before the 
Terrapins lost five of their last 
six six coming into Saturday. 
For the Wolverines, this game 
was just a stopgap before 
Michigan State and Ohio State.
It seemed destined to be 
another boring, easy, road win 
for Michigan, and save a few 
special-teams plays that kept it 
just interesting enough, that’s 
exactly what it was.
The Daily breaks down the 
good, the bad and the ugly 
from the Wolverines’ 38-7 win:
The good
Freshman 
running 
back 
Zach 
Charbonnet 
scored 
two touchdowns to bring his 
season total to 11, a program 
record for touchdowns by a 
true freshman.
The offense looked effective 
in 
both 
the 
running 
and 
passing game, and Michigan 
ran a balanced attack that 
had been missing earlier in 
the season, with 155 yards 
on the ground and 176 in the 
air. While the offense didn’t 
seem quite as dominant as 
it did against Notre Dame, 
the Wolverines did have a 
few highlight-reel plays — a 
51-yard catch by Nico Collins, 
a 39-yard run by Tru Wilson 
and a 29-yard reception by 
Sean McKeon.
Most of all, the offense 
avoided 
any 
big 
mistakes. 
Michigan didn’t turn the ball 
over for a second straight 
game, and did not fumble once 
for the first time all season. 

Both 
senior 
quarterback 
Shea Patterson and redshirt 
sophomore quarterback Dylan 
McCaffrey — who relieved 
Patterson late in the third 
quarter — avoided a sack.
“I think collectively, as a 
group, we’re playing at our 
highest level,” Patterson said. 
“ ... As a group right now, we’re 
kind of hitting our stride.”
It was a similar sentiment 
to the one Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh offered up after a 
10-3 win over Iowa. But this 
time, the statement was fully 
believable.
Don Brown’s unit offered 
more of the same, as the 
defense 
pitched 
a 
shutout 
(Maryland’s lone touchdown 
came on special teams) and 
finished with eight tackles 
for loss, four sacks and an 
interception.
Special 
teams 
also 
had 
three plus plays. Freshman 
wide receiver Giles Jackson 
returned the opening kickoff 
for a touchdown, Mike Barrett 
ran his second successful fake 
punt of the season and Devin 
Gil partially blocked a punt in 
the second quarter.
The bad
With 
any 
blowout 
like 
this, any bad is necessarily 
nitpicky. But there were still 
several little things that the 

Wolverines should continue to 
work on going forward.
While 
the 
defensive 
numbers 
look 
stellar, 
that 
unit struggled on two straight 
drives spanning the first and 
second quarters. Ultimately, 
they were bailed out both times 
— first, when senior safety Josh 
Metellus intercepted a pass at 
Michigan’s nine-yard line and 
then when the Terrapins drove 
to the Wolverines’ 11 before a 
tackle for loss, sack and missed 
field goal.
But against better teams 
like the Buckeyes, Michigan 
can’t sit around and wait for 
the opponent to shoot itself in 
the foot. Especially so early 
in the game, a top team would 
be 
well-equipped 
to 
take 
advantage of such miscues.
The offense also had a few 
drives 
that 
stalled, 
going 
three-and-out twice — and it 
would’ve been three times if 
not for the aforementioned 
fake punt — in drives that 
coincided with the defensive 
lapses early in the game. Had 
the Wolverines not been up 
14-0 at the time, those miscues 
could’ve caused a lot more 
trouble.
The ugly
Special 
teams 
giveth, 
special teams taketh away.
After a nice chunk pass 

to McKeon put Michigan on 
Maryland’s 19-yard line with 
six seconds left in the first 
half, sophomore Jake Moody 
trotted out to attempt the 
field goal. He missed for the 
third time in the past five 
games. Redshirt junior Quinn 
Nordin, who was held out of 
the last two games with an 
undisclosed injury, handled 
kicking duties for the rest of 
the game.
While Moody’s miss opened 
a window to relitigate the 
results of the offseason kicking 
competition 
— 
in 
which 
Harbaugh determined the two 
kickers would split time — 
Nordin’s kick on Saturday was 
his first made field goal of the 
season in four attempts.
In 
another 
special-teams 
miscue, 
the 
Wolverines 
allowed 
Terrapins 
returner 
Javon Leake to take a kickoff 
for a touchdown of his own in 
the third quarter.
But when your only ugly 
moments come on a few special 
teams mishaps, that means 
your performance was pretty 
damn solid. Michigan didn’t 
light the world on fire Saturday, 
but it didn’t really need to. 
Once the Wolverines took the 
lead on the opening kickoff, it 
felt like Maryland never really 
had a chance.

Michigan encouraged 
by split with IU, Iowa

The Michigan men’s swim and 
dive team was thrown into the 
deep end this past Saturday.
That’s not an overstatement. 
Nor is it just a bad pun.
In the team’s first scored 
meet in over a month, the No. 6 
Wolverines (3-1 overall, 1-1 Big 
Ten) were pitted against No. 5 
Indiana (4-0, 2-0) and No. 23 Iowa 
(2-2, 0-2) in Bloomington. While 
Michigan came away from the 
meeting with a split decision – 
besting the Hawkeyes, 218-82, but 
falling to the Hoosiers, 165-135 – 
the stiff competition and hostile 
environment served as a barometer 
for the team’s growth and informed 
the unit on areas of improvement. 
The 
Counsilman-Billingsley 
Aquatic 
Center 
is 
notoriously 
packed with Hoosier fans. Being 
the away team at such a site, 
according 
to 
Michigan 
coach 
Mike Bottom, can have negative 
psychological 
effects 
mid-race, 
which can undermine months of 
work.
“People have the tendency to 
lose their focus against that type 
of support,” Bottom said, citing 
the importance of his athletes 
continuing to “... (do) what they 
want in spite of the distractions.”
The Wolverines did just that, 
starting the competition off with 
an upset win. Bottom called that 
victory in the 200-yard individual 
medley relay a real surprise. 
Michigan’s quartet finished almost 
a second in front of the rest of 

the field. Senior Miles Smalcho 
and junior Luiz Gustavo Borges 
engineered a second-half comeback 
with low splits in the butterfly and 
freestyle, respectively.
The 
following 
events 
saw 
Michigan and Indiana trading 
victories with consistency. Junior 
Ricardo Vargas won both the 1,000 
and 500-yard freestyle events by a 
handful of seconds each. Smalcho 
followed up his heroics in the 
opening relay with a pair of wins in 
the individual butterfly categories. 
“Indiana has been winning Big 
Tens for the last three years, so 
they’re the team to beat,” Bottom 
said. “(We knew) we would have 
to swim up to win the meet and we 
swam up.”
The Hoosiers pulled away in the 
latter half of the meet, spurred by 
their dominance in the freestyle 
and backstroke sprints. Indiana’s 
Mory Gould took control on the 
diving board, winning both the 
1-meter and 3-meter performances 
handily. 
Saturday’s 
final 
event, 
the 
400-yard 
freestyle 
relay, 
iced 
the Hoosier’s jurisdiction of the 
meet and showcased their depth. 
Michigan’s quartet hit the pad 
seven seconds off the lead after 
being thoroughly out-stroked by 
two Indiana foursomes. 
Despite coming up short, Bottom 
was impressed and heartened by 
the Wolverines’ performance. 
“We’re 
really 
encouraged 
because 
they 
had 
all 
the 
advantage,” 
Bottom 
said, 
“... 
hometown officials, hometown 
fans.”

COLUMBUS — With a little 
over a minute remaining in Will 
Lockwood’s penalty for slashing, 
junior forward Dakota Raabe 
skated the puck into the offensive 
zone.
He brought the puck up along 
the boards, but then he lost control 
of it. A few seconds later, the 
referee blew his whistle — Raabe 
was headed to the box for hooking 
and Michigan (3-4-1 overall, 0-2-
0-0 Big Ten) was headed for a 
minute-long five-on-three penalty 
kill against No. 13 Ohio State (6-1-1 
overall, 2-0-0-0 Big Ten).
In 
the 
final 
moments 
of 
Lockwood’s 
penalty, 
Buckeyes 
forward Tanner Laczynski brought 
the puck across the blueline. 
Standing unmarked at the top of the 
left faceoff circle, forward Michael 
Gildon waited for a pass. Before 
the puck even arrived, Gildon was 
setting up for a one-time slapshot. 
He beat sophomore goaltender 
Strauss Mann glove side, just under 
the crossbar.
In an instant, the Wolverines 
trailed the Buckeyes, 1-0, halfway 
through the second period. Though 
Gildon’s goal wasn’t what resulted 
in the eventual 2-1 loss Michigan 
suffered on Saturday night, its play 
through that stretch of the period 
offered no aid.
“I didn’t get a good look at it,” 
said Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
of the call against Raabe. “I don’t 
know if it’s a penalty or not, but to 
put you two men down when you’re 
200 feet from your net, I don’t 
know. We can’t even put ourselves 
in a position to take a penalty like 
that.”
The 
untimely 
penalties 
combined 
with 
poor 
puck 
management 
resulted 
in 
an 
offensive lull for the Wolverines. 
They tallied just four shots on 
net compared to the Buckeyes’ 13 
in the second period. Bad puck 
bounces resulted in turnovers in 
the Michigan defensive zone and 
scoring chances for Ohio State. 
When the Wolverines did manage 

to clear the puck, the Buckeyes 
quickly regained possession and 
Michigan was back to playing 
defense.
“We’re not playing 60 total 
minutes of hockey,” said freshman 
forward Johnny Beecher. “And 
I think that definitely showed 
tonight, especially in that second 
period. We need to dial it in, and 
we need to take care of pucks. 
We’re just giving up way too many 
opportunities in the neutral zone. 
We just need to get pucks deep and 
get it on net.”
Headed into the third and 
looking to put its poor performance 
in the second put behind it, 
Michigan searched for a tying goal. 
There were plenty of offensive 
looks and opportunities, but the 
Wolverines failed to capitalize on 
them.
As 
more 
minutes 
ticked 
from the clock, the Wolverines’ 
urgency increased. With just over 
four minutes left in the game, 
Raabe connected with freshman 
defenseman Cam York as York 
made a push into the offensive 
zone.
When the puck found York’s 
stick just outside the right faceoff 
circle, he drove towards the net. 
York carried the puck behind the 
goal, and in one seamless motion 
completed a textbook wraparound 
to score the tying goal — and the 
first of his career.
“He had one in the first period,” 
Pearson said, “where he circled the 
net like that. We talked (about) if he 
has the opportunity to get around, 

just the way their coverage is, you 
can come in on that backdoor. Good 
for Cam. He’s a heck of a hockey 
player and he’s gonna have many 
more.”
Riding their newfound wave 
of momentum, the Wolverines 
continued their offensive push into 
the closing minutes of the game.
Sophomore defenseman Jack 
Summers settled the puck off the 
boards at the edge of the offensive 
zone. Desperate to keep the play 
alive, Summer attempted to pass 
the puck — but his stick didn’t 
make contact with it.
Ohio State defenseman Grant 
Gabriele reached out for the puck, 
pushed it between Summers’ 
legs and took off on an odd-man-
rush down the ice. Gabriele fired 
a shot at Mann, who deflected 
it wide and right, to the stick 
of Tate Singleton. In a fluid 
motion, he slid the puck past 
Mann’s outstretched pad and the 
Buckeyes retook the lead, 2-1. In 
the waning moments of the game, 
the Wolverines’ attempts with 
an extra attacker didn’t yield an 
equalizer.
When the final buzzer rang, 
Michigan had been swept by its 
biggest rival to open the Big Ten 
schedule.
“The game never comes down 
to one play or an opportunity,” 
Pearson said. “I referenced the 
Ronnie Bell catch against Penn 
State. It doesn’t come to that. It’s, 
again, another tough bounce, 
another tough break, but we gotta 
pick each other up.”

COLUMBUS 
— 
All 
Jack 
Summers could do was stand there 
and watch Ohio State celebrate.
Seconds earlier, the sophomore 
defenseman received the puck at 
the blueline and tried to pass it 
back in to keep Michigan in the 
offensive zone as they looked for 
a go-ahead goal. But Summers 
whiffed on the pass, and that 
half-second with a loose puck was 
all defenseman Grant Gabriele 
needed to take the puck for 
himself.
Gabriele flew through the 
neutral 
zone 
as 
Summers 
desperately gave chase. A shot 
from the left faceoff circle went 
off sophomore goaltender Strauss 
Mann’s pad as he came high in 
the crease to challenge Gabriele, 
which left forward Tate Singleton 
a wide-open net.
Singleton’s wrister found the 
back of the net, and Mann never 
had a chance. Summers was a step 
behind Singleton, catching up to 
the play just a moment too late.
As 
the 
crowd 
at 
the 
Schottenstein Center rose to its 
feet, Summers turned to watch 
Singleton and his teammates 
celebrate the game-winner. He 
dropped his head into his hands, 
and his defeated body language 
said it all.
Not even two minutes after 
freshman defenseman Cam York 
tied the game on a highlight-reel 
wraparound, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
chance at a come-from-behind 
win was all but gone. It took 
Michigan 56 minutes to get its first 
tally of the night, and everyone in 
the building sensed that the 91 
remaining seconds were too few 
for another comeback. 
“(The momentum swing is) 
brutal,” York said. “To work hard 
all game to get that one and then 
to give it up like that, it’s just not 
good. It’s frustrating for sure.”
The Buckeyes’ defense stifled 
the Wolverines throughout the 
game on Saturday. A four-shot 
second period left Michigan in a 

1-0 hole after giving up a power-
play goal, and it took the majority 
of the third period before the 
Wolverines found twine.
In the moments after York’s 
tying goal, it looked like Michigan 
was going to find a way to come 
back and win.
Two shifts later, freshman 
forward Eric Ciccolini picked up 
a loose puck in the defensive zone 
and brought it into the attacking 
zone. He passed the puck to fifth-
year forward Jacob Hayhurst who 
was crashing down on goaltender 
Tommy Nappier, but the pass 
went just past Hayhurst and Ohio 
State got going the other way.
“I liked after we tied the game,” 
said Michigan coach Mel Pearson. 
“I thought, I really did, that we 
were going to win this game. We 
had the momentum and even the 
next shift, we’re in their zone...”
Senior 
defenseman 
Griffin 
Luce got down the ice to break up a 
scoring chance for forward Austin 
Pooley, and the game settled down 
for a few moments.
Then the pendulum swung 
back the other way, and within 
seconds, the Buckeyes netted 
the game-winning goal. It was 
the final blow of the weekend for 
a team that struggled to create 

chances and maintain possession 
of the puck — both of which came 
back to haunt them on the last 
goal.
All 
the 
momentum 
from 
York’s goal was taken out of the 
Wolverines with one whiff on a 
pass and a rebound that went out 
to just the right spot for Singleton 
to send it home.
“It’s heartbreaking,” said senior 
forward Will Lockwood. “You 
know, I think we worked really 
hard. It’s a big play from Yorkie, he 
really stepped up and made a huge 
play to tie it up and bounces like 
that are just going to happen. And 
you can’t always get the bounce 
your way and unfortunately, it 
went their way and ended the 
game there.”
After the game, Pearson was 
quick to point out that the game 
never should’ve come down to that 
one play off Summers. A mistake 
by any one player almost never 
decides a game, and Lockwood, 
the Wolverines’ captain, wanted 
to make sure Summers knew that. 
 
“I just told him to forget about 
it,” Lockwood said. “No one on 
our team is going to point fingers. 
If someone points fingers, they’re 
on the wrong team. That’s not 
what we do here.”

The 
Michigan 
women’s 
soccer team pounded on the 
door right from the initial 
whistle Sunday in the Big Ten 
Tournament 
quarterfinals, 
dominating Maryland in time 
of possession and shots on goal 
for the entirety of the match. 
But for the first 35 minutes, the 
scoreboard didn’t reflect that. 
Every time the Wolverines 
got remotely close to putting 
the ball in the back of the net, 
Terrapins 
goalkeeper 
Erin 
Seppi was ready — making 
her backline look good for 
Michigan’s first five shots on 
goal. But with the Wolverines 
consistently pushing the ball 
into the final third of the pitch, 
Maryland was bound to break.
With 9:31 left in the first half, 
forward Jayde Reviere manned 
a three-on-two counterattack. 
Striking a curving cross from 
midfield 
over 
the 
head 
of 
two Maryland defenders, the 
freshman caught sophomore 
midfielder Meredith Haakenson 
in stride, who just had Seppi to 
beat. 
Haakenson sent a hard-hit 
ground ball right into Seppi’s 
hands, but the goaltender was 
unable to reel it in, setting up 
freshman 
forward 
Danielle 
Wolfe for an easy follow — 
tacking on the first goal in a 3-0 
victory for No. 3 seed Michigan 
(13-4-1 overall, 8-2-1 Big Ten) 
over the sixth-seeded Terrapins 
(9-7-3, 5-5-1).
“I usually play on the right 
side with Meredith, so I know 
her 
movement 
fairly 
well,” 
Reviere said. “My thing is I love 
to cut inside so being on the left 
side, I think the coaches knew 
that I had a little more freedom 
to be able to kind of mix up the 
opponents mind. 
“(Haakenson) was able to 
take a beautiful touch, able to 
take a shot on goal. It didn’t 
obviously result in a goal for 
her, but it did for (Wolfe) and 
at the end of the day, a goal is a 
goal.”
A near lock for the NCAA 

Tournament, the Wolverines 
kicked off the postseason in 
style. Amassing a total of 21 
shots and 13 shots on goal, they 
didn’t let up their intensity in 
the second half. 
Ten 
minutes 
in, 
Sarah 
Stratigakis, the newly-crowned 
Big Ten Midfielder of the Year, 
found 
herself 
against 
two 
defenders in the box. As a result, 
Haakenson, the team’s leading 
goal-scorer, 
was 
left 
wide 
open for a clean through pass 
from Stratigakis. This time, 
Haakenson beat the goalkeeper 
and Michigan’s score doubled, 
giving it a comfortable cushion 
for the rest of the game. 
Forward Emma Cooper scored 
the first goal of her junior year 
campaign as well.
The 
shutout 
wasn’t 
the 
only 
testament 
toward 
the 
Wolverines’ 
suffocating 
defense. Even more revealing 
was 
that 
Maryland 
didn’t 

have any shots on goal and six 
shots total, showing that the 
midfielders played their part 
in limiting the Terrapins from 
breaking into the final third of 
the field.
“Just really happy with the 
clean sheet,” said Michigan 
coach Jennifer Klein. “We’ve 
had a lot of good results over 
the last couple of games, but just 
haven’t been able to get a clean 
sheet, so I think that today 
was really good for our team’s 
confidence moving forward.”
Michigan 
will 
have 
to 
overcome 
a 
much 
greater 
challenge next weekend in the 
semifinal round, traveling to 
New Jersey to play tournament 
host and No. 2 seed Rutgers, 
who defeated the Wolverines, 
1-0, on Oct. 24. 
But, with a chip on its 
shoulder and consistency on 
both sides of the ball, this team 
could be a tough out.

Late in a first half that had 
yielded 
open 
chances 
but 
no goals for the Michigan 
women’s soccer team, a pair 
of freshmen blew the game 
open for the Wolverines. Right 
back Jayde Riviere sent a cross 
from near midfield that caught 
the 
Maryland 
defense 
off 
guard and set 
Michigan 
up 
with a scoring 
opportunity. 
Fellow 
freshman, 
forward 
Dani 
Wolfe, finished 
off 
the 
play, 
out-racing 
Maryland’s 
center back down the pitch 
and tapping the ball in off a 
deflection.

“The 
goalkeeper 
shifted,” 
Wolfe said. “And it was just a 
little hard work to outrun the 
second center back to finish 
that for us.”
It was this play and others 
made by the two freshmen 
that helped give Michigan a 
convincing 3-0 victory over 
the Terrapins on Sunday and 
a berth into the semi-finals 
of the Big Ten 
Tournament.
“They’re 
continuing 
to 
grow 
and 
continuing 
to 
get 
better 
within 
our 
group,” 
said 
Michigan coach 
Jennifer Klein. 
“I think you see 
the confidence, 
I think they’re really getting to 
know the expectations for them 
as players.”

Wolfe 
has 
continued 
to 
impress after a stellar freshman 
regular 
season, 
where 
she 
earned a spot on the Big Ten 
All-Freshman team. She also 
tallied an assist in the match 
after coming off the bench. 
“This is such a great group of 
girls who work so hard,” Wolfe 
said. “So, I just match that 
when I come onto the field and 
just work as hard as I can. As a 
freshman coming in, you just 
make the impact you can.”
Wolfe nearly scored later 
in the game as well, when she 
just barely struck wide off a 
pinpoint pass from Riviere — 
a connection that reflects the 
bond that the two have formed 
off the field, as well.
“Dani 
and 
I 
are 
very 
close friends outside of this 
environment.” Riviere said. “... 
She’s like a sister to me and I 
think that kind of helps with 
the chemistry on the field. We 
go to the field and get some 
repetition together, so I think it 
just shows in the game.”
Riviere, for her part, played a 
multi-faceted role in Michigan’s 
gameplan. Her contributions 
from right back did not end 
up in the box-score statistics, 
but she managed to impact 
the game in all three areas of 
the pitch. Riviere has handled 
her demanding role well this 
season, and found herself on 
the Big Ten All-Freshman team 
with Wolfe. 
“As a fullback at Michigan, 
the demands are that you’re 
an end-to-end player,” Riviere 
said. “You should be able to get 
in attack and be able to get back 
and defend.”
As the season has gone on, 
these two talented freshmen 
have forged a strong bond and 
helped each other to grow. 
Their 
progress 
this 
season 
has proven invaluable to the 
Wolverines, and will be a boon 
for Michigan as it continues its 
postseason run. 
“They’re confident, they’re 
relaxed,” 
Klein 
said. 
“And 
I think they’re having fun, 
which I think you can see when 
they’re on the field.”

Metellus at 
the center 
of shutdown 
performance

COLLEGE PARK — After the ball 
had found Josh Metellus and landed 
in his hands like a soft pop-up, after 
he had gotten up from the pile and 
turned toward the sideline and after 
Maryland’s hope of doing something 
had been extinguished as much as 
mathematically possible in the first 
quarter of a football game, he let 
everyone know it.
He hopped around, hands clapping 
together, then one going to a money 
sign. He high-fived Brad Hawkins, 
then swaggered back to the bench 
with a helmet-tap from Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh.
There was never much of a reason 
for the Wolverines to be anything 
but confident on Saturday. They 
came into College Park to a stadium 
filled with mostly their own fans and 
whipped the Terrapins, 38-7. Their 
defense was rarely tested, and that 
has as much to do with the simple fact 
that Maryland doesn’t have the talent 
to compete with Michigan than it 
does with anything else.
But as far as assessing that talent 
— for the season at large, and for this 
game — Metellus stands at the center 
of it all.
The senior safety finished Saturday 
with nine tackles, eight of them 
solo and two of them for loss. The 
Terrapins managed to string together 
three drives with a chance of ending 
in points all day, and one of them 
ended in that Metellus interception.
“(Metellus) is one of the captains,” 
said senior linebacker Josh Uche. “We 
need that. We needed that out of him. 
“It just gives the whole defense 
confidence.”
In a Michigan football ecosystem 
where 
the 
defense 
is 
rarely 
questioned, and in a Don Brown 
defense 
where 
pressure 
is 
the 
lynchpin of everything, it’s easy to 
forget the importance of a safety — 
a position that often exists to be the 
band-aid on everyone else’s mistakes.
On Saturday, it couldn’t have 
been more evident. In the run game, 
Metellus is often the “spill” player, 
meaning his job is to cover the edge 
as 
Michigan’s 
interior 
defenders 
force the running back that way. On a 
quarterback run Saturday, Maryland 
quarterback Lance Legendre was only 
looking at defensive end Kwity Paye. 
As he tried to get the edge, there was 
Metellus with what Harbaugh called 
“a statement kind of tackle.”
It wasn’t the only one of those 
plays Metellus made in the run game. 
Another came later in the third 
quarter, after Anthony McFarland 
hit a hole hard for a first down, with 
what looked like space in front of him.
“And then Josh got from point A 
to point B and made the tackle that, 
it stopped (McFarland),” Harbaugh 
said. “Turned him back to his goal 
line. ... And to have a safety come 
up and make that kind of play, that’s 
a statement in the game. That was 
really impressive.”
Metellus’ growth through four 
seasons 
is 
well-chronicled. 
He 
stayed at Michigan for his senior 
season when he could have gone pro 
and likely been drafted, choosing to 
instead improve his NFL draft stock 
and finish out his college career as a 
captain.
It would have been easy for him to 
shut down after the Wolverines got 
blasted in Wisconsin, and easier still 
to do that after a second loss at Penn 
State ended their College Football 
Playoff hopes, and all but eliminated 
them from Big Ten title contention.
Instead, there he was on Saturday, 
flying around the field in a game that 
was both meaningless and all but 
predetermined.
“I feel like we’ve been showing 
up every week since that Wisconsin 
game,” 
Metellus 
said 
afterward, 
seated next to Harbaugh in a cramped 
media room. “Everybody on this team 
been doing what they’ve been trusted 
to do. And I feel like the confidence 
is real high, but I feel like we still got 
that one play mentality to keep us 
pushing throughout the rest of these 
games.”
That mentality — and keeping it 
through the season— has as much to 
do with Metellus, the senior leader on 
this defense, as anything else.
“That loss hurt,” Metellus said, 
thinking back to the Wisconsin game. 
“And we came in and next Monday, 
we knew we had to get the job done. 
“And we knew how.”

COLLEGE 
PARK 
— 
Jim 
Harbaugh is not one to disclose his 
gameplan, even after a win.
But whatever he envisioned for 
Saturday’s trip to 3-5 Maryland, 
giving up a pair of six-minute 
drives into the red zone before 
halftime wasn’t it.
Neither ultimately ended with 
points, thanks to a missed field goal 
and a Josh Metellus interception, 
but for 20 minutes, the Terrapins 
drove 
down 
the 
field 
with 
relative ease. It wasn’t the same 
explosiveness that they showed 
when they scored 142 points in 
the first two games of the season, 
but when you come in expecting a 
blowout, two long drives is enough 
to raise an eyebrow or two.
Michigan’s response? Two first 
downs and 25 yards allowed on 
the next six drives, buoyed by the 
constant defensive pressure that 
led the Wolverines to 38-7 win.
“The pressures, really (were the 
difference),” Harbaugh said. “I 
think that led to just about every 
three-and-out that I can think of, 
was we were making (Maryland 
quarterback) Josh Jackson throw 
it quick, throw it away or get a 
sack and put him in a long yardage 
situation.”
The pressure, though, didn’t 
only come after the slow start.
It took all of three snaps for Josh 
Uche to find himself in Maryland’s 
backfield, swarming Jackson and 
forcing a punt. Two drives later, his 
second sack pushed the Terrapins 

out of the red zone, precipitating 
their missed field goal.
“(Defensive coordinator Don) 
Brown’s just done a great job just 
trying to get me in as much as 
possible, utilize the things I’m 
good at, and just try to build some 
things around me, stuff like that,” 
Uche said. “For the system I’m in, 
he’s just trying to get me on the 
field as much as possible.”
Added Harbaugh: “He’s on a 
mission when he’s in pass rush, 
you just see it. And that was — the 
way our guys are getting to the 
quarterback, that was big today.”
Those sacks, as well as Metellus’ 

interception 
— 
a 
product 
of 
pressure from fifth-year senior 
defensive end Michael Danna — 
kept Maryland off the scoreboard 
when at least three points felt like 
an inevitability. In a heavily maize-
and-blue Maryland Stadium, they 
kept fingernails out of mouths and 
maintained the pervasive sense 
that Saturday afternoon was a mere 
stepping stone to more important 

games.
Still, 
it 
wasn’t 
what 
the 
Wolverines wanted, with every run 
play seemingly going for four yards 
and paving the way for a pair of 
chunk passing plays off play action.
Led by Metellus’ two tackles 
for losses, neither of those trends 
lasted 
long. 
The 
drive 
after 
Maryland’s missed field goal, he 
burst into the backfield, forcing 
running back Anthony McFarland 
into a three-yard loss.
Two plays later, the Terrapins 
punted for the first time in more 
than a quarter.
“To have a safety come up and 
make that kind of play, that’s a 
statement in the game,” Harbaugh 
said. “That was really impressive.”
For the rest of the game, that 
ability to break into Maryland’s 
backfield was the overwhelming 
trend, whether it was Metellus, 
sophomore 
linebacker 
Cam 
McGrone or sophomore defensive 
end Aidan Hutchinson doing it. As 
a result, Jackson spent his return 
from an ankle injury fleeing a 
consistent slew of pass rushers, 
unable to find any sort of groove 
on a day where he finished 9-for-20 
with 97 yards and an interception.
And at the end of the day, 
Michigan had its second-straight 
near-shutout, 
with 
Maryland’s 
only points coming on a kick-return 
touchdown.
Last week, against Notre Dame, 
it came thanks to the Wolverines’ 
speed that prevented the Fighting 
Irish from executing its gameplan. 
This week? Just ask Harbaugh.
“The pressures were key all day.”

The pressures, 
really (were the

just about every 
three-and-out.

Special 
teams lift 
Wolverines 
in win

COLLEGE PARK — Giles Jackson 
had scored a touchdown before, back in 
September. But that one didn’t feel right.
Jackson ran the wrong route then, 
and though he caught the pass anyway 
— in the fourth quarter of a 52-0 blowout 
of Rutgers — the score was somewhat 
meaningless.
On Saturday, Jackson scored his 
second touchdown of the season in a 38-7 
win over Maryland. This time, he did 
everything right.
He fielded the opening kickoff, darting 
around defenders, sprinting down the 
sideline and coasting into the end zone. 
His teammates egged him on along the 
sideline, pointing and saying, “He about 
to take it to the crib,” according to junior 
wide receiver Nico Collins.
“I saw a little crease on the inside,” 
Jackson said. “Then, I thought I was 
getting close, I tried to go back out, then 
(redshirt junior linebacker Devin Gil) 
made the huge block and I cut back inside 
and just started running. As soon as he 
made that block, (I knew I was gonna 
score), cause I wasn’t letting the kicker 
tackle me. I would’ve been sick.”
Michigan has historically struggled 
on the road, even against lackluster 
opposition, even when the stadium is 
half-empty and full of its own fans. 
There’s only so much you can do to 
prepare, but after the early-season 
debacle at Wisconsin, the Wolverines 
have especially emphasized one thing: 
starting fast.
And nothing says a team that came 
ready to play like putting up seven points 
before a single second ran off the game 
clock.
“That was a big emphasis coming 
into this game on the road,” said senior 
quarterback Shea Patterson. “... Kickoff 
kinda set the tone for the game.”
Though Michigan went up 14-0 after 
two offensive drives, it nearly fell victim 
to its other constant road woe: fading 
down the stretch and letting the other 
team back in. The Wolverines went three-
and-out on their next two drives as the 
Terrapins found the red zone each time 
— and could have made it a close game if 
not for an interception and a missed field 
goal.
But just as it seemed the Wolverines 
were about to have their third consecutive 
drive without a first down, special teams 
came through again.
Facing fourth-and-1 from its own 27, 
Michigan brought out the punt team — 
but instead of snapping the ball to redshirt 
junior punter Will Hart, the Wolverines 
instead gave it to redshirt freshman 
Michael Barrett, who pushed for the first 
down, then dragged his tacklers 13 more 
yards.
On the next play, Patterson completed 
a 51-yard bomb to Collins to set up first-
and-goal, a situation that easily led to 
another touchdown.
“It was fourth-and-1,” Collins said. 
“So it was kind of like a, ‘Hopefully they 
fake it,’ and they did. When we all came 
back on the field, Shea trusted us and the 
playcall and took a shot and I came down 
with it.”
The fake punt was a call Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh has been perfecting 
for weeks. A good trick play requires three 
things: versatile players, the right game 
situation and an element of surprise.
Barrett, an athletic high school 
quarterback turned linebacker turned 
special teams fiend, was the perfect man 
for the job, and he’d already converted 
a fake punt this season against Army. 
Harbaugh wanted to run the play on a 
fourth-and-short in his own territory — 
check. And of course, no one expects a 
fake punt from a team up two scores in 
the second quarter.
“We thought we could get it,” 
Harbaugh said. “ … We took advantage of 
the work that we put in and I thought it 
was a good time to call it and it helped us 
win this game. The look and the element 
of surprise, and the way we practiced it 
made us confident that we’d execute.”
The play injected a dose of confidence 
into a team that seemed to be caught 
snoozing. 
The 
Wovlerines 
scored 
a touchdown three plays later. The 
Terrapins never threatened again.
Bad road team or not, Michigan was 
clearly the better team, and it likely 
would’ve won the game no matter what. 
But with two early special teams plays, 
the Wolverines left no doubt who owned 
Maryland 
Stadium. 
Without 
them, 
an easy win would’ve looked a lot less 
dominant.
“We needed that, that fake punt,” said 
senior linebacker Josh Uche. “We needed 
that pretty badly. That kinda killed their 
momentum.”
