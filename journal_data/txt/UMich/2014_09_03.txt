University President Mark
Schlissel's two-week trip around
Michigan did more than just

include a sunset cruise and a win-

vision for the University's role in
the state.
Prior to starting his new job as
the University's president in July,
Schlissel said he wanted to take a
few weeks off during the transi-

suggested a trip around the state to
offer an opportunity to learn about

droves of people pouring buck-

this past month in an unprec-
edented effort to raise funds
and awareness for amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, also known as
Lou Gehrig's Disease. Dona-
tions to the ALS Association
have topped $100 million since
the tce Bucket Challenge began,
and they just keep coming.

At the end of August, the
University's A. Alfred Taub-
man Medical Research Insti-
tute accepted the challenge,
as Neurology Prof. Eva Feld-
man, director of the Institute
,and a long-time leader of ALS
research, took the plunge.
ALS is a neurodegenerative
disease that affects the motor
-neurons of the brain and spi-
nal cord. According to the ALS

Association, the disease affects
roughly 30,000 Americans at
any given time. Currently, there
is no known method of revers-
ing or stopping the progression
of the disease. Having worked
with ALS for more than 25
years, Feldman said it was natu-
ral that she would participate in
the Ice Bucket Challenge.

The Central Student Govern-

On Tuesday, CSG Assembly

members heard about her past
involvement with student gov-

learned that if she were a candy,
she would be a Reese's Cup.
And so, after debate, LSA
senior Emily Lustig was voted
into the vice president position
with 30 voting in favor, nine
abstaining and one opposing her

ascension to the position.
CSG's first meeting came in
the wake of LSA junior Meagan
Shokar's resignation last week,
and subsequently led to some
contention regarding her ulti-

Despite a strong majority vote
in Lustig's favor, some CSG rep-

Former Detroit Mayor Dennis Arcer talks'

as mayor that Detroit might go Secondly, because of the job loss

-5-,

it had a terrific impact on the
city of Detroit because citizens
who live in the city, or indeed
those who live outside the city
but work in the city, they pay
income tax. And when there's
a job loss or there's layoffs or
companies go bankrupt, people
are not able to work overtime.
That means the second source
of income, income tax, is down
substantially.
The other thing that occurred
that hurt the city of Detroit was
that we've been losing popula-
tion in the city of Detroit since
1953. In 1952, we had 1.82 mil-
lion people living in the city of
Detroit. We've been losing pop-
ulation ever since (now under
700,000).
When you lose that kind of
population, you also lose people
paying taxes, both property tax
and income tax, and so those
kinds of things all combined
together served to cause the city
to run out of money, no cash to
pay its bills.
TMD: How do you think
Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr
and Mayor Mike Duggan have
handled the bankruptcy situa-
tion so far?
Archer: I think Kevyn Orr is
doing a remarkable job. I think
Mayor Duggan and Kevyn Orr
are working very nicely togeth-
er. As well as the demonstrat-
ed commitment between the
mayor, in this case Mike Dug-
gan, and the city council lead by
Council President Brenda Jones.
They work very well together
and that has created a very posi-
tive atmosphere within the city
and the responsibility that has
been turned over to Mayor Dug-
gan to run. Please remember
that emergency financial man-
ager, under our state statute, has
broad authority. He could have,
should he have chosen to do so,
stripped the city council and
Mayor Duggan of any defini-
tive role to play, but he did not
do that. He worked with Mayor
Duggan, and Mayor Duggan and

Kevyn Orr are working together.
There are some things I know
that Mayor Duggan would like
to have quicker, but despite that
they still have a good working
relationship, which bodes well
for the city of Detroit.
TMD: What do you think of
Mayor Duggan's vision for the
future and his long-term goals
for the city?
Archer: With the way the
city was existing at the time
that Mayor Duggan was sworn
in and came into office, I think
he's done a remarkable job with
the opportunities that he's
had before him. He's not had a
chance to come in and be, 'the

ing he's

things
that
would
appeal to people. If we could get
them to come to the region, we
could get them-to come to the
city of Detroit.
TMD: Since the bankrupt-
cy last summer, Detroit has
changed its national story to
one of recovery and the future
but there are still plenty of
people, including students at
the University, who see only
blight and crime. What will
it take for people's minds to
change?
Archer: It's sad when you
consider where you are, at an
outstanding university, 45
minutes away from the city of
Detroit, for someone to have
that view without asking ques-
tions and learning about it and

reading it closer. Do we have
abandoned buildings? Yes. Well,
remember what I indicated
before: we had 1.82 million peo-
ple living in the city of Detroit
back in 1951 - '52. The city of
Detroit, according to the census,
the population today is about
690,000 people. If you lose 1.12
million people over that num-
ber of years you don't need the
same housing units. As it relates
to crime, that problem occurred
because of the fiscal problems
the city was having and the
failure to properly monitor
and come up with a good bud-
get. At the time I left office we
had, I think, about 3,700 police
officers. Today we've got about
2,600, and that's what Dave
Bing inherited when he became
mayor and that's what Mayor
Duggan is dealing with. But that
can be solved and will be solved
and is being solved now and
crime is being reduced.
So, all I'm saying is that you
can find whatever you want to
find and find something and
make it negative or you can be
objective and say, "You know
what, here's how you change it."
Students have different areas of
interest that cause them to go
to the different colleges within
the University of Michigan.
You've got outstanding profes-
sors, you've got brilliant young
people who are your classmates.
You're there to learn and you're
there to learn because I think
you want to make a difference
in this world. So, rather than
looking at something and say-
ing, "Gee, it's bad," and walking
away with that impression, the
question is, "Ok, what would you
do about it? What are your sug-
gestions?"
If people are just content to
sit back and go on what hear-
say happens today, then those
people will always have a nega-
tive impression, and you can't
change it unless they see for
themselves, or are willing to be
objective and open up their eyes
and see the progress that's being
made.

cial manager. It's proven that
between the two of them they

Detroit in a position to succeed.
Judge Steven Rhodes has also

TMD: One of your major
accomplishments as mayor was
attracting developers to Detroit.
How were you able to do that
and how can Duggan do the
same in the coming years?
Archer: We were very com-
mitted to bringing jobs into the
city of Detroit. We needed jobs
and we needed to have that kind
of opportunity in the city of
Detroit. One of my friends, Al

Driver murdered
as a result of a
road rage incident
Southeastern Michigan author-
ities say a man shot and killed
another man who approached his
vehicle after a road rage incident.
Livingston County Undersher-

happened about 3:35 p.m. Tuesday
in Genoa Township, near Howell
and about 45 west-northwest of
Detroit.
Murphy tells WHMI-FM that
two vehicles were eastbound on
Grand River when one passed
the other. He says both stopped
at an intersection and a 43-year-
old man got out of his vehicle and
walked over to the other vehicle.
Murphy says the 69-year-old
man driving the second vehicle
fatally shot the 43-year-old, then
pulled over and waited for police.

Thirty teens
escape from youth
detention center
Thirty teens "overwhelmed"
their minders at a juvenile deten-

breaking out of four dormitories
and then crawling under a weak
spot in a chain-link fence. By
Tuesday evening, seven were still
on the run.
Police caught up with some
walking along roads or coming
out of the woods. Some turned
themselves in, including one at
the guard shack Tuesday evening.
And some were swiftly returned
to the detention center by their
own families for their own good.
"He broke loose, he was gone,
but he's back now," said LaWanda
Knowles, whose nephew joined
the escape. "I just want to know
that he's here safely and he's OK
- I don't want the police jumping
on him, nobody beating on him or
nothing."
LOS ANGELES -
Hacker obtains
naked photos of
celebrities
Apple said Tuesday that hack-
ers obtained nude photos of Jen-
nifer Lawrence and other female
celebrities by pilfering images
from individual accounts rather
than through a broader attack on
the company's services.
Meanwhile, numerous sharing
sites r moved images of the stars
apparently in response to copy-
right complaints.
However, experts say there is
no way to fully scrub the photos
from the Internet and the imag-
es could keep popping up in the
future, forcing celebrities to file
repeated complaints as they play a
cyber-version of the arcade game

"whack-a-mole."
Apple said its engineers have
determined that hackers breached
individual accounts and didn't
obtain general access to a pair of
the company's services - iCloud
and Find my iPhone. The tech
giant said it released the results
after conducting 40 hours of
investigation.
Law enforcement inquiries
likely will take days or weeks to
complete.

of a second American journalist,
Steven Sotloff, and warning Presi-

U.S. airstrikes against the militant
group continue, "our knife will
continue to strike the necks of
your people."
The footage - depicting what
the U.S. called a sickening act of
brutality - was posted two weeks
after the release of video showing
the killing of James Foley and just
days after Sotloff's mother plead-

ALS

make an ALS free world is our pas-
sion," Feldman said. "We're very
excited about participating, donat-
ing and getting other individuals
to participate and become more
aware of the disease."
The Institute's challenge video
is posted on their website and has
put a twist on the original chal-
lenge by usingbeakers rather than
buckets. In the video, Feldman
challenges other ALS scientists to
take up the Ice "Beaker" Challenge
as well. Feldman also instigated an
Ice Bucket Billionaire Challenge,
directed at philanthropist Alfred
Taubman, the man for whom the
Institute is named. Taubman,
who is 90 years old, accepted
the challenge, recognizing the
groundbreaking work done at his
namesake.
Feldman said she is happy to
donate to the ALS Association, as
the organization has supported
both the Institute's ALS clinic and

its stem cell research. She said she
expects the money to fast-track,
therapies to treat the disease.
"It's an extremely interest-
ing and important event that's
occurred," Feldman said. "Who
knew that a bucket of ice on your
head could result eventually in
$100 million dollars to address in
a very novel way this horrible dis-
ease?"
Some of the money could even-
tually be awarded to the Univer-
sity. Feldman said her lab already
has several ideas for new projects
concerning ALS they would like
funding for, and they are also look-
ing to further advance their stem
cell studies.
"They may put out a call for
distributing the money," Feldman
said. "We will be there, and we
hope to be first in line."
The Institute has already ben-
efited from the challenge, as Feld-
man said donations have increased
in the past month. Additionally, as
of Aug. 25, the Michigan Chapter
of the ALS Association had gener-
ated roughly $50,000 in donations

as a result of the challenge. ALS of
Michigan focuses on clinical care,
contrasting the national orga-
nization, which focuses on both
research and care.
"What that will mean for our
clinic and other clinics are more
dollars for clinical care, which is
very important," Feldman said.
Feldman addressed the critics
who have pushed back against the
Ice Bucket Challenge, who argue
that the challenge is funneling dol-
lars into ALS research that could
have been directed at other, more
common diseases. She said the Ice
Bucket Challenge shows the pub-
lic is receptive to donating to bio-
medical research, and opens the
doorway for other activists to gain
money for disorders throughsocial
media.
"I think that really what the Ice
Bucket Challenge can do for the
other disorders is lay the gaunt-
let down," Feldman said. "What
can be the next social media way
in which those disorders can
raise new money for biomedical
research and clinical trials?"


TOUR

gan where large populations ofstu-
dents come from, as well as places
of interest across the state. The trip
included stops in Detroit, Dear-
born, Grand Rapids, Traverse City,
Lansing, Midland and the Upper
Peninsula.
According to the Office of the
Registrar's Fall 2013 Enrollment
Report, 3,479 University students
hail from Wayne County, home to
Detroit and Dearborn. Another
1,083 students reside in Kent Coun-
ty, where Grand Rapids is located.
Lansing's Ingham County produc-
es 575 students and Traverse City's
Grand Traverse County produces
234 students. Two-hundred-and-
thirteen students are from Mid-
land County.
The couple's first stop was
Detroit, where they visited the
Detroit Institute of Arts and chose
to sign up for a membership. They
also saw the Renaissance Center,
which is the world headquarters
of General Motors, and enjoyed the
Midtown neighborhood's mix of
shops and eateries.
"Detroit was in many ways the
most interesting," Schlissel wrote
in an e-mail interview. "Having
heard and read so much about its
economic difficulties, it was excit-
ing to see strong signs of renewed
investment and the seeds of recov-
ery."
In recent years, the University
has expanded its efforts to engage
with the city of Detroit, including
the creation of a Detroit Center
and Semester inDetroit, a program
tha gives students the opportunity
to spend a term living and learning
in the city.
However, Business sopho-
more Corey Johnson, who is from
Detroit, said the University could
increase its connections with
Detroit, including more participa-
tion in improving the city's public

internal transparency in the name
of Shokar's privacy - who cited an
injury and resulting treatment as
the cause for stepping down. The
announcement was made through
social media on Shokar's twitter
and Facebook page.
While CSG President Bobby
Dishell, a Public Policy senior,
followed the council's constitu-
tional bylaws by vetting Lustig
himself, also getting approval
from the CSG Executive Nomina-
tions Committee, representatives
not on that committee were frus-
trated that they had not been noti-
fied of her potential appointment
earlier.
Speaking from personal expe-
rience as vice president last year,
Dishell said he trusts Lustig to
put in the work necessary to make
student government initiatives
successful.
"It is an extremely thankless
job, and one that is incredibly
important to us here and to the
University," he said. "There is no
one who is more qualified."
Some, like CSG Vice Speaker
Laurel Ruza, a Public Policy

senior, felt Lustig's nomination
process had circumvented the

schools.
"There are quite a few students
who come from Detroit and Metro
Detroit, and it is necessary for him
to see where we come from," he
said. "Having heard and read so
much about its economic difficul-
ties, it was exciting to see strong
signs of renewed investment and
the seeds of recovery. I am now
very bullish on Detroit. I've been
asking around campus learning
about the University's many proj-
ects in and about the city."
In Lansing, Schlissel and
Schwebs walked the plaza con-
necting the State Capitol with the
Judiciary Building and visited the
Michigan Historical Museum.
Schlisseliwill likely be a frequent
visitor to Lansing. During her ten-
ure, University President Emerita
Mary Sue Coleman traveled to the
state's capitol to lobby for increas-
ing funding for higher education,
which has seen extensive cuts in
recent years.
The couple also traveled to
Grand Rapids, where they enjoyed
the downtown area and public
space in front of the Grand Rapids
Art Museum.
LSA senior Nick Ellis, who
is from Grand Rapids, said he
watched this downtown area
become reinvigorated over the
course of his high school years.
"It looks beautiful now, truly
revitalized," Ellis said. "There is
a new plaza, art galleries and new
apartments. I love to hang out
there when I'm home."
He said it's comforting to know
the new president is making an
effort to engage with his home-
town.
"Grand Rapids has always been
second to Detroit," Ellis said. it
really has so much to offer. Itwould
be great if the University could
build up a stronger tie to the west
side (of the state)."
On the other side of the state,
Schlissel visited the Dow Chemi-
cal Company in Midland, where
he met with company leaders who
majority of the representatives.
Ruza said Lustig wasn't the most
qualified candidate and fur-
ther asserted that the selection
process had "delegitimized the
assembly."
Medical student Michael Yee,
the only assemblyman to oppose
Lustig's election in the final
vote, said he felt protecting Sho-
kar's privacy didn't excuse the
closeted process of her replace-
ment's selection, adding that the
representatives themselves only
learned about her resignation
through social media.
"I don't think a person's priva-
cy and transparency in selecting
a candidate for vice president are
mutually exclusive," Yee said.
LSA sophomore Swathi Shan-
mugasundaram echoed this con-
cern earlier in the night during
the debate, before which repre-
sentatives were given the oppor-
tunity to ask Lustig a total of eight
questions about her potentially
elevated role. This was in addition
to the nomination committee's
introductory endorsement.
"I just feel like I don't know
you, and that's the problem for
me," Shanmugasundaram told
Lustig. "I don't think it's fair that

I got maybe two minutes to speak
on behalf of what, a thousand stu-
dents that I'm representing, to

have worked with the University
on issues of sustainability.
Schlissel's father worked for
Dow as a pharmaceutical salesman
and took many trips to Midland.
Schlissel and Schwebs also spent
time in some of the state's most
popular vacation destinations,
including Glen Arbor, Mich. and
the Sleeping Bear Dunes National
Lakeshore. Theyalsotook awinery
tour in the Leelanau Peninsula and
trekked to the Upper Peninsula,
where they enjoyed a sunset cruise
on Lake Superior to see Pictured
Rocks National Lakeshore.
"I was struck by the size and
beauty of the state," Schlissel said.
"Lake Michigan is every bit as
pretty as Cape Cod."
One of Schlissel's final destina-
tions was the 10,000-acre U-M
Biological Station on Douglas Lake
in Northern Michigan.
Biology Prof Knute Nadelhof-
fer, director of the University of
Michigan Biological Station, ate
lunch with Schlissel and Schwebs
and gave them a five-hour tour
around the station.
"President Schlissel was very
outgoing, very interactive with
the staff, students,-faculty and
researchers," Nadelhoffer said.
"He clearly understood what we
did here before he came; he had
learned about that on his own."
Schlissel said he was impressed
by the station and noted it is a great
setting to do important environ-
mental and ecosystem research.
On top of learning about the
state that Schlissel will now call
home, he also said the trip pro-
vided an important chance to
evaluate how the University can
better interact with the state that
it's meant to serve.
"There is room for increased
engagement all across the state,"
he said. "It reinforced my belief
that the University must take very
seriously its role as an engine for
the state's economy."
get to know you, to say you're in
this position. I'm not saying that
you're not qualified ... but I think
that we all need more time to get
to know you."
Shanmugasundaram later pro-
posed that the assembly postpone
voting on Lustig's election until
the next meeting, which was
struck down.
Lustig said she went through
three or four rounds of interviews
with Dishell in addition to speak-
ing with other assembly members.
"It's really important for the
vice president to work with the
president well, and know the
inner workings of CSG well," said
LSA Senior Emily Sexton, head
of the Nominations Committee,
later adding that Lustig's quali-
fications in that capacity were
unparalleled.
Shokar, who attended the meet-
ing, remained silent throughout
the conversation.
After the meeting, Lustig said
in an interview that she under-
stood those of her peers who were
initially hesitant to confirm her as
vice president.
"I understand them being
skeptical and critical," Lustig
said. "That's their job. They

were asking the questions that I
think many students will or have
already asked."

HAYDEN
From Page 1A
Howard Brick, Louis Evans
Professor of History, said that
other universities, includingthe
University of California, Berk-
ley and New York University,
were interested in the collec-
tion. However, Brick said Ann
Arbor was a special place for
Hayden.
"I think he felt that his own
history here at Michigan and in
Ann Arbor tugged at him and
made it seem most appropriate
that that collection come here,"
Brick said.
Hayden's collection will be
housed in the Joseph A. Laba-
die Collection, which assembles
collections related to the his-
tory of social and political pro-
test movements from the 19th
century to the present, in the
Hatcher Graduate Library.
Julie Herrada, the curator for
the Labadie Collection, is in the

tunity to experiment with
innovations that will allow stu-
dents to interact and collabo-
rate more on course material.
Timothy McKay, Arthur F.
Thurnau Professor of Phys-
ics, professor of astronomy and
director of the LSA Honors
Program, is serving on an advi-
sory group that will guide the
new office. After his positive
experience developing his own
program that uses learning ana-
lytics to tailor to the classroom
experience for students in large
introductory courses, McKay
is confident in the University's
new large-scale push.
McKay said his tool, ECoach,
was originally used in phys-
ics and then applied to vari-
ous classes that allowed him to
explore the challenges of differ-
ent needs.
"Interest has grown and now
we're ready to use it in 20 dif-
ferent places on campus with 10
different variations. And that's
getting too big for me to man-
age," McKay wrote, as he is also
chair of the Learning Analytics
Task Force.
McKay added that DEI has an
important role in expanding the
program's use.
"All of this emerged organi-
cally. What DEI can do is bridge'
that gap between innovation and
infrastructure. We'll have in this
resource the expertise to trans-
late something from a tool used
in an enthusiast class to Univer-
sitywide use."
process of arranging the docu-
ments so students and faculty
can use them.
"It is a fascinating collection
and very valuable historically,"
Herrada said. "It'll be very use-,
ful to students and researchers
for many years tocome."
Brick said this collection
gives an in-depth look into
activist movements during the
1960s and how those move-
ments affected everyday poli-
tics.
"It's an extraordinary record
about how the activism of the
1960s could live on afterwards'
and trying to bring those radi-
cal perspectives into ordinary
.politics and policy making,".
Brick said.
Hayden is coming to the Uni-
versity in mid-September to
speak to the staff of The Michi-

editor from 1960-61. He is pub-

Council passes resolution
for ridesharing agreement

Decision comes
after an increase
in regulations
By JACK TURMAN
Daily StaffReporter
The Ann Arbor City Council
is working to keep up with the
increasingly popular rideshare
companies Uber and Lyft, revisit-
ing the issue of their operational
status Tuesday night as a wealth
of potential rideshare clients,
University students, settled into
campus.
Following the defeat of apro-
posed ordinance last month to
increase regulations on taxi ser-
vices that was targeted at ride-
sharing services, the council
passed a resolution requesting
the City Administrator Steve
Powers negotiate operating
agreements with ridesharing
companies. Councilmembers
Sabra Briere (D-Ward 1), Sally
Hart Petersen (D-Ward 2) and
Christopher Taylor (D-Ward 3)
sponsored the resolution.
The parameters for ride-shar-
ing companies, which operate
using non-professional drivers,
include a minimum of $1 mil-
lion dollars in liability insur-
ance if operating in Ann Arbor
and required driver background
checks for drivers. Much of
the resolution's language was
derived from a discussion at last
month's meeting.
According to the Uber web-
site, Uber currently provides a
commercial liability insurance,
background checks and cash-
less checks to ensure physical
and financial security. However,
taxi drivers and companies are
enraged that ride-sharing com-

pany drivers are not required to
have a chauffeur's license and a
commercial vehicle plate, along
with not complying with Michi-
gan Limousine Transportation
Act.
A number of citizens at the
council meeting Tuesday night
testified in favor of regulation
argued that competitionbetween
taxi companies and ride-sharing
companies isunfair, with ride-
sharing companies having less
defined liabilities and fewer
constraints. Ride-sharing com-
paniessuch as Uberuse asmart-
phone app to connect drivers and
riders. Incontrastthoseopposed
to regulation argued that ride-
sharing companies provide bet-
ter public safety policies thantaxi
companies.
Peterson said the evolv-
ing world of technology helps
increase the competition
between ride-sharing companies
and taxi companies.
"I think Ann Arbor has to keep
upwiththetimes," Peterson said
"We want to be a technology:
town. We want to be innovative.
We've got to keep up with it."
Peterson added that the Taxi-
cab Board needs to make more
changes, but are headed in the'
right direction.
"I think it is time for the taxi
cab board to reevaluate their:
regulations," Peterson said. "I do'
agree that deregulating the fare?
is a step in the right direction." -
Councilmember Stephen;
Kunselman (D-Ward 3) said he'
disagrees with the resolution'
because Uber does not have to:
comply with the Michigan Lim-«
ousine Transportation Act.
"What this resolution does:'
though is create what I perceive"
as an undercutting of city attor,
ney's authority,"Kunselmansaid.*

Cooking is chemistry

Coming back to Ann Arbor last week
was definitely a reality check. Not
because of school starting or leaving
home again, but rather, I
had to start cooking for
myself again. And I guess
this is a column on my love
for food. However, to be
clear, by no means am I a
foodie. I'm just a hungry
college student who occa-
sionally has some time on DEREK
my hands. WOLFE
During the summer
at camp, every meal
was provided to me at a
consistently average quality. And for better
or worse, there was variety - though the
breakfast burritos did get repetitive. Some
nights, the doctors and nurses at the clinic
would even be generous enough to buy pizza
and other food for the entire clinic staff. That
was awesome and worry-free. I didn't have to
lift a finger.
But now, it's back to making trips to
the grocery store, making my own dietary
decisions and watching my bill climb as my
food gets rung up at the front of the store. I
'happen to prefer self-checkout.
Shopping for food is often a hassle, but
admittedly one of my favorite things to do. At
'this point with a year of experience under my
'belt, I kind of have it down to a science. The
frozen foods and cookie butter are bought
at Trader Joe's. The fruits, vegetables and
snacks at Kroger. The pack of Arnold Palmer
cans and chicken at Costco. Though I do have
this routine, I've found picking out my meals
for the next week or two to be somewhat
enlightening. I have complete control,
'total independence and an opportunity for
creativity. This combination can be a rarity.
It's just me, my basket and my fellow shoppers
'who always park themselves in the middle of
each aisle while deciding which Campbell's
soup to pick out.
I know I'm not the only one who finds it
exciting to find the two-for-one deals of just
'what you wanted and picking out the crispiest
apples. The best feeling comes from thinking
about how to combine different products to

make a dish that has never been made before.
It's probably going to be pasta or something
like that. But still, for a brief moment each
week, I feel like a visionary. Heck, call me
Elon Musk. As a side note, Costco chicken
and Trader Joe's frozen pastas go really
well together.
Of course, it's one thing to buy food and
another to cook it. But, I'd like to believe my
enthusiasm for picking out my food carries
over to the kitchen. I've heard it said that the
kitchen is one of the only places where sharp
objects and open flames - or hot burners - are
socially appropriate. There's a certain thrill
from slicing, dicing, chopping, baking, grilling
and frying. Not really microwaving, though.
Anyway, I've found the process of going
from raw materials to a finished meal
extremely gratifying. For one, I'm no longer
hungry after eating. And two, it gives me a
sense of accomplishment, especially when I
can feed my friends and they like what I make.
On multiple occasions, I've even sent pictures
of my creations to my family. And yes, they
are proud.
I think what it comes down to is that I
enjoy working with my hands and exercising
my mind. Cooking accomplishes both.
It's therapeutic.
Again, I'm no chef. I don't even spend hours
at a time in the kitchen. Most of the time, I'm
trying to put together a good, simple meal as
quickly as possible so I can get back to work
on school business. But taking this step back
to write and reflect on food, I've realized
how meaningful cooking can become and the
control it gives me over my personal health. If
I don't want something in my body or even be
tempted to eat something by its presence like
Hershey's chocolate, then I don't buy it. It's
that simple. And if I want to try some crazy
recipe off the Internet, I can.
As someone who likes science and being
challenged intellectually, cooking falls
perfectly into that category.
Cooking is chemistry.
And since I passed Orgo lab, I must be
capable of doing it.

One of my first nights in
Australia, my hall and I were having
a couple drinks and talking about
money. Many of them were hoping
to find jobs in the area and asking
for advice on where to send out their
C~s. Some were complaining about
working for $14.00 an hour (Yeah,
I tried to hide my scoffing when I
heard that too).
They finally got around to
talking about university fees. In
Australia most university fees
are paid through the government
by a program called the Higher
Education Contribution Scheme.
During university, the education
is free and the student only has
to pay it back when and if they
start making over $50,000 a year.
University tuition in Australia is
capped at $10,000 and most are
lower. One of my hall-mates wasn't
on HECS. Her parents were paying
- full price - for her schooling. The
other people in the group were
shocked, confused as to what it
would mean for a kid to have their
parents pay upfront for school.
I shrank back a little.
$10,000 or less a year? I thought.
What the hell are they going to think
of me paying almost $50,000?!
A week ago a new budget
was proposed in the Australian
government. Under the budget the
government would no longer cap
tuition prices for universities. The
universities would now be allowed
to set their own prices, higher fees
based on how profitable a certain
major is thought to be later on.
HECS will now start collecting
interest and if you are between 25

and 30 years old you will either
have to "Learn or Earn." This is a
welfare program that only gives
benefits if the person is in school
or has a job. The government will
force a young person back to school
if they are unable to find a job.
As the United States government
begs and pleads with universities to
keep their costs low, the Australian
government has gone the direct
opposite route. In America, as much
as we hate the extreme tuition prices,
we have become desensitized to
them. In Australia that isn't the case.
Even these seemingly small changes
caused massive uproar.
University students held protests
in the center of Melbourne that shut
down the tram system. Joe Hockey,
the budget writer, was on a political
question & answer program where
Australian Citizens didn't so much
as ask questions but take shots at
him and the new budget. It was the
topic for every newspaper article
and radio broadcast.
Even though the changes and the
prices were very different from the
United States of America, some of
the sentiments from the students
I talked to were similar to those
in the States. Most were just upset
about the bleak future they seemed
to be in for. Everything seemed to
be getting worse, less jobs, less sup-
port and an education system that
is run like a business - something
United States students gave up on
trying to combat decades ago.
The interest place on HECS
seemed to cause the most distress
after the uncapping of university
prices. Student loans are a huge

burden to American college stu-
dents. They're also a huge drain on
the American economy. It therefore
makes sense that Australian stu-
dents would fear the same burden
being instituted for them.
"Kids from the country of
Australia already don't go to Uni
because they are too afraid to create
debt, it's just the culture they have
grown up in," said Lucy Johnson,
a first year at Australian Catholic
University. Even though they might
never have to pay any of it back if
they don't get a well-paying job,
the fear of debt just runs too deep
in rural areas. According to the
students I talked to the 10 percent
interest on HECS will increase
these fears and continue to dissuade
rural kids from getting degrees.
The astronomical prices of
tuition in the States doesn't seem
to dissuade many from going to
college because we have been
taught that a college degree is a
requirement for the 21st century
world. The New York Times wrote
an article that stated a college
degree is still valuable. It's worth
the debt burden that students have
and fear once they graduate. In my
bubble of Silicon Valley, a university
education was the only kind I
wanted, regardless of the cost.
While Australian students
fear the changes coming to their
education system, we fear the
status quo: that nothing will change
except the continued rise in tuition
and debt.

The dead end for nationalsm

I

Watching the watchmen

Without government - and without
police - we, as human beings,
would lose most of our rights.
The comedian George
Carlin once said, "Rights
aren'trights if someone can
take 'em away," instructing
his audience to read up on
the internment of Japanese
Americans to "find out
all about your precious
fuckin' rights." JAMES
Japanese Americans BRENNAN
had their freedom
taken away because the
government stopped protecting them (and,
in turn, acted directly against them). Carlin
believed that human beings have no rights
even with government, and in some ways he's
correct. Rights and freedom are just ideas that
human beings invented and try to enforce.
We aren't always successful, but in a country
like the United States, rights and liberties
have strong protections and enforcement
mechanisms, allowing us - for now - to have
a good amount of freedom. Like all things, this
freedom is temporary. But what keeps it alive
is government.
If you disagree, answer me this question:
Where do rights come from? Many argue that
their rights are inalienable, that they come
from some "creator" or from nature, as the
Declaration of Independence argues. These
are both fine theories, but I can't recall the
last time God arrested and tried a murderer,
nor the last time "nature" stepped in to
protect black children from mobs outside of
segregated schools. Natural rights are an
interesting concept, but rights aren't real
unless they're protected. That's the whole
point of government. Yes, the state can be used
as a tool for tyranny as well, but human beings
come together and create government so that
our freedom will be guarded.
Police are one of the mostbasic mechanisms
governments use for the protection of rights.'
They are called law enforcement officers for
a reason - they enforce laws, and laws are
typically aimed at protecting key rights like
life, safety and property.
I won't mince words: I hate American
police in their current form. While the events
in Ferguson, Mo. this summer should not
surprise anyone who is vaguely familiar
with criminal justice in America, they are
nonetheless appalling. Police officers have
become armed to the teeth and conditioned

to a mindset of us vs. The Criminals/The
Rioters/The Thugs. Instead of protecting
rights and liberties, police are often taking
them away from people. I don't trust police,
and I probably never will, but with that being
said: I would never want to live in a country
without them.
The only reason we have the freedom that
we love is because the government (usually)
protects us. The Constitution and all of its
amendments are brilliant, amazing ideas, but
even if they're written down and passed by
legislatures, they mean nothing. We need a
way to protect our rights, and police are one
of those ways. The consequences of an overly
militarized police force go far beyond one
notable incident where a teenager is killed and
protests are oppressed. Martin Luther KingJr.
once spoke of injustice anywhere threatening
justice everywhere; the threats to civil rights
and civil liberties seen in Ferguson, Staten
Island, Davis and other cities is a threat to
every American. As police fail to do their job,
our rights slip away.
In Ferguson, police and the governor shut
down freedom of movement and assembly,
enforcing curfews and assaulting protesters
with tear gas and rubber bullets. It didn't
matter what the Constitution said at that
point - its defenders were busy rewriting the
First Amendment with their guns and tanks.
These same events have happened before,
they will definitely happen again, and they
could feasibly happen anywhere. Rights are
not permanent; they last only as long as we
protect them.
In 1963, Governor George Wallace of
Alabama made his famous "stand in the
schoolhouse door," physically standing in
the way of Vivian Jones and James Hood as
they attempted to register for classes at the
segregated University of Alabama. President
John F. Kennedy federalized the state's
National Guard, and a military escort guided
the students past the governor to officially

The European Parliament elec-
tions that took place about two weeks
ago may have an historic importance
as the far-right and anti-European
Union politicians are gaining more
power in the largest single assembly
in the world. Even though the right-
leaning parties performed worse
than they did five years ago, there
are more than hundred non-affili-
ated lawmakers, most of whom are
expected to join the alliance of the
rightists and the nationalist.
As the Eurozone crisis revealed
the deficiencies of economic policies
of the EU, considerable amount of
political parties in Europe became
willing to attack the EU system while
bringingbackthe ideasofnationalism
and patriotism. It sounds quite scary
when someone simultaneously uses
the concept of "nationalism" and
"Europe" as we get enmeshed in
unpleasant recollections of Adolf
Hitler's Germany, Benito Mussolini's
Italy, and Joseph Stalin's Soviet
Union -where multiple nations were
living under the strident Russian
nationalist propaganda.
A famous extremist in Greece,
Nikolaos Michaloliakos, is the
leader of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn
party and a firm supporter of anti-
immigration laws. Michaloliakos
is also known for his admiration of
Adolf Hitler. It's that same Greece
that fought a war against the Nazi
Germany and lost 5-10 percent
of its population. Meanwhile, its
Jewish community was almost
exterminated. Despite the staunch
efforts of the Dawn party supporters
in Greece they're still lacking a
significant foothold in the country.
The best portrayal of nationalism
comes from acontroversialjournalist/

polemicist Christopher Hitchens: "I
have often noticed that nationalism
is at its strongest at the periphery.
Hitler was Austrian, Bonaparte
Corsican ... The most extreme Irish
Republicans are in Belfast and Derry
(and Boston and New York). Sun Yat
Sen, father of Chinese nationalism,
was from Hong Kong..." I see the
quote is missing a very important
piece. Joseph Stalin - a Georgian
dictator - was the leader of an
empire that was established after the
Russian invasion of free Republics,
including Georgia (country).
Although nationalism sounds like
an unhealthy ideology to me, it's also
important to be able to distinguish
it, from patriotism. I would like
to describe the difference in a
hypothetical way. Let's assume that
I was born in China and immigrated
to Sweden when I was a teenager.
Subsequently, I can become a
Swedish patriot after growing a deep
affection for the country. However,
the same scenario doesn't work
with the idea of nationalism. With
no Swedish heritage and cultural
background I cannot declare myself
a Swedish nationalist. Thus, the
leaders mentioned above could have
been patriots at their best before they
abused the nationalist propaganda to
carry out their hawkish policies.
Patriotism could be a means to
contribute to the prosperity of coun-
tries as long as it's not being exploited
in any wrongdoings by the morally
corrupt politicians, which unfortu-
nately happens a lot. A prominent
19th century Russian satirist Mikhail
Saltykov-Shchedrin's reference to
the aforementioned case is flawless:
"They are talking a lot about patrio-
tism - must haye stolen again."

In my sincere opinion, I don't
believe that nationalism is a pro-
gressive theory that aims to prosper
nations without harming anyone.
It's the worst enemy of peace that
ironically supports peace through
strength. To be clearer, nationalism
shows more hatred towards other
nations than respect to your own.
No one wants to see the repeat of
the Holocaust, deadly .battles that
claimed the lives of many brave
people or the gang-rapes of innocent
Germans that took place during the
invasion of Germany.
Nationalist movements that
are firm supporters of the anti-
immigration laws will eventually
acknowledge the fact that there's
no room for xenophobia in modern
societies anymore as the integration
of nations becomes common. Who
knows, maybe a hundred years
from now it will sound ridiculous
to our descendants that there used
to be borders and nationalities in
our world. That's a discussion for
another day as I don't want to sound
like an anarchist.
What's more important for now is
that people realize the irrelevance
of one's nationality when it comes
to determining his/her individual
values. Nationalism will not
prevail because it's senseless to
be proud of something that isn't
an accomplishment, but has been
randomly assigned to you.
In loving memory of the heroes
and victims of the World War II
Only June 6, 70 years will
have passed since the Invasion
of Normandy.

BUENA VISTA
Thank you for years of laughter.
Griev1in for a stranger

whether to nod along with the
soundtrack and say "Yeah, we
really should seize the moment,"
or laugh and say "I remember
being a high teenager who would
say things like that to someone I
wanted to make out with."
I'm sure many will disagree
with me, which is fine. What I
really want to get across is that
the aesthetic shortcomings and
technical merits of "Boyhood"
are not mutually exclusive. In
fact, there are many celebrated
films that aren't fun to watch.
Sergei Eisenstein's "Battleship
Potemkin," a Soviet-era chroni-
cle of a mutiny on a Tsarist ship,
was ranked by the British Film
Institute as #11 on their "Top
50 Greatest Films of All Time"
poll. Due to its innovative use
of film editing and montage,
"Battleship" is a great techni-
cal achievement. But a silent
propaganda film can only be so
engrossing; in the end, it's more
interesting than enjoyable. How
about "Frankenstein," that icon-
ic monster movie? Influential as
it may be, I've always found it to
be rather simple and sadistic, as
the nuanced creature from Mary
Shelley's novel is turned into a
moaning brute whom the main
characters delight in burning to
death.
Will "Boyhood" be as influen-
tial as "Battleship Potemkin" or
"Frankenstein"? It's impossible
to know, butI can say with some
degree of certainty that it will
be discussed, studied, emulated
and parodied more than most
films. I still don't think "Boy-
hood" is particularly profound
in its message, or even fun to
watch. But it is innovative, and
for now that is enough.

ByREBECCAGODWIN
DailyArts Writer
over the years Ihad often heard
people remark how deeply the
death of a celebrity had affected
them. I had always found the state-
ment odd, because as much as I
enjoyed a celebrity's body of work,
I had never been so deeplytouched
as to feel true sadness when one
passed away. I would feel a twinge
of remorse for the family, but
then my life would simply go on
- unchanged by the news. I had
grown so used to this detached
way of dealing with celebrity
deaths that I could never have
guessed justhowhard the death of
Robin Williams would hit me.
My parents and I were seated
around our kitchen table, eat-
ing dinner and talking about that
day's events. The TV was on in the
background and an entertainment
gossip show was advertising some
new Johnny Depp movie. Halfway
through a clip of the cheesy com-
edy, the breaking news symbol
flashed across the screen accom-
panied by the dramatic music. All
three of our heads turned imme-
diately to the TV, preparing for
the terrible news that could only
ever come with such an inter-
ruption. I read the words at the
bottom of the screen before the
announcer said them and uttered
a stunned "Oh my God." My par-
ents soon mirroredmy shock as
the announcer explained howeel-
ebrated actor Robin Williams had
been found dead in his home at the
age of 63.
I only heard bits and pieces of
the remainder of the broadcast,
picking up on key words like
"asphyxiation" and "potential
suicide," but none of them truly
resonated. My phone immedi-
ately exploded with texts from
friends expressing their disbe-

lief at the news. I responded,
only slightly aware of what I was
saying. I couldn't explain it, but
the news had left me inexplica-
bly sad. I sent out the perfuncto-
ry tweet expressing my regrets,
but nothing seemed to shake
away the sadness.
The next night, Ilay in my bed
reading through the top headlines
of the day. Details of Williams's
suicide had been released and
even though I knew that reading
the article would only upset me, I
clicked the link and began the first
paragraph. By the time I reached
the end of the graphic description
of his death, I was in tears and
they wouldn't stop. I must have
looked ridiculous, sprawled out on
my bed at 2 a.m., literally sobbing.
Even though I knew his death
didn't directly affect me, I felt as
though it did. I felt like I had lost
one of the few consistent sources
of happiness in my life and then
immediately felt even worse for
being so selfish. He had a wife and
three children who were no doubt
more devastated by the loss, and
I was grieving as though he were
a close personal friend I had -lost
and not a complete stranger.
I eventually calmed down and
over the next several days began
attempting to understand why
I had been so rattled by Wil-
liams's death more so than any
other celebrity's. I obviously did
not know him personally - Ihad
never even been lucky enough to
meet him- butstill, deep down,
past reason and logic, I felt like he
had been a part of my life.
It's difficult to put into words
the exact reasons I felt so connect-
ed to this famous stranger. Per-
haps it was because I had always
found a little bit of my own father
in the fuzzy comedian with the
kind eyes and a smile constantly
pulling at his lips: My dad thrives

in front of an audience, lives off
the laughter of others and has
battled with depression off and on
for years.
Or perhaps it was because" of
the characters Williams had por-
trayed while I was growing up.
Whether he was dressed up as an
old Scottish woman or using his
happy little thought totake off into
the sky, I could always count on
Robin to make me laugh, and then
cry, and then laugh again. And in
the end there was always some
kind of message I could take from
the film to apply to my own life.
His characters never patronized
the children he interacted with,
instead treating them as equals,
and as a child who was constantly
being told what to do by the adults
around me, it was refreshing to see
one act differently.
Or perhaps it was because as I
grew, I knew that if I was having
a bad day I needed only to turn
on one of his many manic stand-
up routines or play a few of his
interviews to feel better. Even
when months went by when I
didn't watch one of his movies or
see one of his interviews, redis-
covering his work always felt like
running into an old friend, com-
fortable and familiar.
Now that several weeks have
goneby,I'vefinallybeguntoaccept
that I both knew and didn't know
Robin Williams. Nothing can ever
take away the man I grew up lov-
ing. His movies will always remain
some of my favorites and there will
always be a YouTube clip to watch
when I need a smile. He was many
things for me over these last 20
years. He was part teacher, part
friend, part father figure, part
entertainer and, unfortunately,
part tortured soul. But above all,
he was one-of-a-kind, and though
he mayhave been astranger,Iwill
miss him deeply.

Beyoncee: Queen of summer

ByADAM THEISEN
Daily MusicEditor
Forget about "Rude," "Problem"
or "Fancy," those songs of the sum-
mer that were anointed by default,
not by popular demand. Even if
those songs happened to get the
most radio play this summer,
they couldn't compare to the true
Queen. The dog days' most domi-
nant artist didn't release a new
album and didn't even really have
a new single to sell, but this sum-
mer (much like this whole year)
was the summer of Beyonce.
We unanimously agreed that
Beyonce was an amazing, game-
changing album within hours of
its surprise release, but the fact
that it's stayed relevant over the
past few months, despite huge hits
from Ariana Grande, Iggy Azalea
and Nicki Minaj, has only added
to its reputation. Plenty of pop
albums make a huge splash, but
most fade away by the time the
next Next Big Thing comes along.
Beyoncd's surprise Christmastime
release was a bit of a gimmick that
built buzz and advertised itself
for free through superfan Twitter
meltdowns. But once all the hype
died down, we were left with one
of the most daring, exciting and
experimental albums ever made
(even without the "pop" qualifier).
You could take any song from
Beyonce and hold it up as the
album's best, but for the purpose
of this article I'm going to use
"Partition."One ofthemanysongs
on the record that features the fin-
gerprints of previously unknown
producer Boots (who's given the
most free reign on "Haunted"),
"Partition" expertly navigates
through multiple sections, main-
taining a strong central theme
despite the numerous songwrit-
ers and producers credited. Open-
ing with a live vocal sample that
clearly emphasizes how Yoncd is
not single ("Hey Mrs. Carter"),
Queen B declares that "radio said

speeditup,Ijustgoslower."While
plenty of pop stars declare their
rebellion, it's rare to hear one who
actually lives it. While still stay-
ing behind the couple's patented
publicity smokescreen, Beyonc6
takes her millions of listeners in
the back of her limo as she and
Jay-Z vividly show that marriage
doesn't always equate to "settling
down." The bass throbs and the
synth notes shoot into the air like
fireworks, until finally, to top it all
off, Beyonce brings in a sample
of Julianne Moore's "Do you like
sex?" monologue from "The Big
Lebowski," but in French! Plenty
of albums exude don't-give-a-fuck
opulence and ambition, but none
of them have been so universally
beloved, or perfectly calculated,
as Beyonce.
"Feminist: a person who
believes in the social, political,
and economic equality of the
sexes." In an age where many
pop stars still, for some reason,
misunderstand the label or shy
away from its political connota-
tions, Beyonc6 not only embraces
the fact that she's a feminist,
but also uses a TED talk from
renowned author Chimamanda
Ngozi Adichie to underscore that
point. The image of Beyoncd's sil-
houette standing in front of the
word "FEMINIST" on an LED
screen had to be the most defining
moment of this summer's VMAs.
Beyoncd, with its unashamed
sexuality, feminist strength and
disregard for pop music's conven-
tions, stands as a defining symbol
of music, and will undoubtedly
live on for years to come.
That's not to say that Beyoncd
spent the summer coasting on her
December album. She released
the Nicki-Minaj-featuring "Flaw-
less" remix and garnered almost
as much surprise, fanfare and
acclaim as the original album did.
She continued to fuel the gossip
columnists with her "Of course
sometimes shit go down when

it's a billion dollars on an eleva-
tor" line, which, of course, may
have just been a genius publicity
move, but regardlessawas the most
memorable lyric of the summer.
She also played shows across the
country with her husband (who,
after the lukewarm reception of
Magna Carta Holy Grail, must be
thankful that at least someone in
the family has still got it) in THE
Blockbuster Tour of the Summer.
Capping it off, Beyonce performed
a medleyof every single song from
Beyonce at the aforementioned
VMAs, a more-than-suitable vic-
tory lap for what's been one of the
most successful stints, both criti-
cally and commercially, that any
artist has enjoyed.
Beyonce is still
relevant months
after its surprise
release.
While a lot of this summer's
Beyonce-mania came from last
year's record, the fact that Beyon-
c6 has dominated the past few
months isn't any less impressive.
As the public got to absorb Beyon-
cd more and more, its reputation
soared. Beyonce is certainly no
stranger to ginormous hits, but
Beyoncd was her first album that
truly felt both entirely connected
as one whole work and adventur-
ous in a way that no other pop
album has ever been. Beyoncd
came out in the winter of 2013, and
Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift and
MAGIC! all topped the charts this
summer, but looking back, seeing
the mark that Beyoncd has made,
there's no way that we'll come to
view the summer of 2014 as any-
thing other than the summer of
Beyonce.

Michigan preps for South Bend racket

Coaches blasting
Irish fight song to
mimic environment
By MAX COHEN
Daily Sports Editor
Two brothers, John and
Michael Shea, wrote and
published the Notre Dame fight
song together in 1908. The duo's
lyrics include, "Cheer, cheer for
old Notre Dame/Wake up the
echoes cheering her name."
Those echoes have survived
the test of time. One hundred
six years later, the Michigan
football coaching staff is
preparing for them. Before
the final meeting between the
programs for the foreseeable
future, they have been blasting
the song at the team's practice
facilities this week.
It has become engrained in
their players' heads.
"The coaches said they play
it all the time when we're there,
so they just want us to get used
to it and not let it bother us,"
said sophomore running back
De'Veon Smith.
It could be up to a new duo,
Smith and sophomore running
back Derrick Green, the other
member of Michigan's 1-2 punch
at running back, to quiet the
spirit that the Shea brothers
helped create.
How the running backs and
the offensive line adjust to
Saturday's difficult environment
in South Bend will be key.
Smith and Green are coming

college careers.

team still has many holes to fill.
After losing longtime goalkeeper
Haley Jones and all-time leading
scorer Rachael Mack from last
season's team, Michigan pines
for new leaders to step up.
Over the weekend, sophomore
Chris Lueb and freshman Sam
Swenson split time in goal,
recording eight and six saves,
respectively. In the field, Smith
and senior Ainsley McCallister
helped control possession and
push the offense. Still, no bona
fide scoring threat exists yet.
With arguably the toughest
opening weekend in the country,
Michigan was presented with a
unique opportunity to learn its
weaknesses early. Big Ten play
begins in three weeks, so the
losses have the potential to be
more valuable than wins.
But above all else, the
Wolverines will just be happy to
finally be home.

Two bronzes for
Coon in Croatia

Record-setting losses worry Ryan

M' standout one

two to compete
)oth styles at Jr.
rld Tournament
By ZACH SHAW
Daily Sports Writer

It's not difficult to realize
that heavyweight wrestler
Adam Coon excels on the mat.
For the fans at the FILA
Junior World Tournament in
Zagreb, Croatia, it took less than
a day. In case they forgot, he
reminded them four days later.
At the championships Aug.
6-10, the Michigan sophomore
went a combined 8-2 with
five pins against world-class
competition to take bronze in
both the Greco-Roman and
freestyle divisions.
"I feel like I wrestled pretty
well," Coon said in a video
interview with
FloWrestling.
"I tried to
push the pace "I tr
as much as
possible. I push t
went out there
to dominate, as m
and there were
some matches pOns
that I did
dominate."
Coon
began his week by pinning
Stepan David of the Czech
Republic at the 45-second
mark. He followed with an 8-5
comeback win over Korea's
Seungchan Lee and a pin of
Hungary's Adam Mertse in the
quarterfinals.
The lone defeat of Coon's
day was to Sergey Semenov
of Russia, the eventual gold
medalist. Coon rebounded
after a long break, though, by
pinning Japan's Arata Sonoda in
the opening minute to preserve
bronze. I
"I had some ups and downs
through it," Coon said, "and
got caught in some positions I
didn't like and got beat up a little
bit here and there. But I kept
working to battle back and got
the fall that I needed (to secure
bronze)."
Coon's bronze was the only

U.S. medal in any Greco-Roman
weight class, but the Michigan
standout wasn't content with
just one medal.
Coon - more comfortable in
the freestyle - maintained his
initial impression by breezing
to another 4-1 record four
days later. His day began with
consecutive 10-0 technical falls
over China's Qiang Tao and
India's Rangi Roubaljeet, and
he added a pin over Azerbaijan's
Oyan Nazaryani.
Like earlier in the week, the
semifinals proved troublesome
for Coon. Facing familiar foe
Amar Dhesi of Canada, Coon
fell in a heated 7-6 decision.
Struggling early, Coon mustered
a comeback and looked poised
for a one-point victory with 18
seconds to go.
But confusion with scoring
stopped the match, giving Dhesi
time to recover, and he tallied
a two-point takedown with
just five seconds left to seal
the victory.

digging that
underhook
the entire
match," Coon said. "I had that
body lock and knew I could get
it. He kept square with me, so I
figured I go with that body lock,
toss it and see what happens.
"You have to put the previous
match behind you and get after
it in the last match. I'm happy
for the bronze but upset for the
loss that came with it."
Despite aspirations for gold,
Coon settled for medalingtwice
despite being one of just two
wrestlers from any country to
compete in both styles at the
event.
"It was a bit of a juggling
act going between two teams,"
Coon said. "But it was nice
to have all those teammates
supporting me. I couldn't have
done it without the coaching
staffs or my teammates. They
were the ones pushing me and
helping me."


ByJAKELOURIM
Daily Sports Editor
Young as it is, the Michigan
women's soccer team has tried
to stay away from focusing on
results early in the season. But
the worst two-game stretch in
program history might be cause
for concern.
Never had the Wolverines
lost two weekend games by a
combined eight goals. They
hadn't given up five since a 6-0
loss to Wisconsin-Milwaukee
in 2009 and hadn't surrendered
eight in two games since Aug.22
and 24, 2008.
"Friday, we didn't represent
Michigan - we didn't represent
anybody," said Michigan coach
Greg Ryan. "Representing
Michigan athletics has got to
be the thing that always shows
up for us. If we play like we did
Friday night, we'll get beat badly."
After Michigan escaped
with a pair of 2-0 wins over Cal
State Northridge and Bowling
Green the previous weekend, its
issues snowballed in San Diego.
The back line, which is playing
with four new starters at times,
broke down, most notably with
an own goal against San Diego
State on Sunday.
The offense misses all-time
leading scorer Nkem Ezurike,
who was often the only forward
last season. Even the goalkeeping
position, which returned
sophomore Taylor Bucklin, is up
for grabs between Bucklin and
freshman Megan Hinz.
But most importantly, the
Wolverines couldn't respond
to deficits this weekend - and
Ryan doesn't necessarily see that
getting much better.
"If we get down a goal, maybe
we can come back," Ryan said.

Women's soccer coach Greg Ryan has never suffered through such a lopsided weekend, Michigan was outscored 8-0.

"But so far, we're not there yet.
It could happen, I'm not saying
it won't, but it didn't happen
Sunday, didn't happen Friday,
hasn't happened yet. Until it
happens, I'm not sure there's
evidence to support the fact that
it's going to happen."
In the past two years,
Michigan has lost eight times,
only once by more than one goal.
The Wolverines were in every
game, even at their worst.
Ryan continued to talk about
the team's inexperience: Senior
midfielder Jen Pace, a captain,
did not start a game last season,
while junior midfielder Cassie
Collins started just four.
"When we got down our
first goal, everyone was a little
frazzled because it was the first
goal we'd given up and it came
so fast in the game," said junior
midfielder Corinne Harris. "We

have decided that we're always
going to get together after
goals to make sure we can keep
pushing through."
The Wolverines haven't
trailed much in recent seasons
- falling behind just six times
last year. But on Friday, San
Diego's first goal was followed 18
minutes later by another, which
was followed eight minutes later
by another. Sunday, the own goal
came eight minutes after the
first goal.
"Last year's team didn't get
down very often," Ryan said.
"That was a reflection of that
team, they were so determined
and focused. Our mantra was
relentless, and that team was
relentless. This group is just
beginning to learn what it
means to play with that kind of
an effort."
Ryan told his team after the

game Sunday that five players
had good performances. He
declined to name them to
the media, but noted that the
Wolverines will need more
players competing. He hoped
that by calling those players
out to his team, others would
follow them.
Until they do, there might
be more crooked results. In the
meantime, there might be one
remedy to responding to one-
goal deficits: not allowing them
in the first place.
"I think realistically, this is a
team that at this point anyway,
isn't going to (go) well if we're
down a goal," Ryan said. "We
haven't showed the signs yet
that we can create enough
opportunities to go down a
goal. Our focus is going to be on
team defending and not giving
up a goal."

Cusack said, describing her
style as retro. "It's like a sec-
ond life for clothes."
In a house on Detroit
Street in Kerrytown, a sec-
ond life exists beyond cloth-

that of city police, the FBI
and Homeland Security.
However, some students
still doubt Big House secu-
rity. Carmen, an LSA sopho-
more, and a friend strolled
into the Big House prior to
January's Winter Classic
hockey match - after simply
walking up to the student
entrance and lifting the latch
thatholdsthemaingate shut.
Though she claimed the
gate may have been unlocked
because people were inside
working to prepare the sta-
dium and lay down the ice
rink, shenoted thather entry
was easy and went entirely
unnoticed.
"I honestly thought any-
one could go in there," Car-
men said. "I didn't think I
was inadvertently breaking
in."
As far as punishing stu-
dents, Forsberg said it
depends on the circumstanc-
es, and is ultimately up to the
officer's discretion. It's really
about preventing a repeat
offense, he said; and some-
times a warning is sufficient.
The question remains:
is the fear of a larger con-
sequence enough to break
a withstanding tradition?
Engineering sophomore
CooperYoungsimplywalked
into the Big House last year
following the first basketball
game.
"It was a lot of fun see-
ing it in the dark, completely
empty," he said. "It may have
seemed even bigger without
all the people there, without
everything kind of blending
intothe maize."
Young was with a friend
at the time, and they were
not alone. Several people
strolled in to take a look at
the vacant stadium from the
top of the bleachers, before
security guards told them to

ing. The Treasure Mart has
been family-owned for 54
years, and is one of several.
secondhand stores carrying
household items.
"Well, all cities probably
have consignment shops,
but I don't think there are
too many quite like The
leave.
However, Young's obser-
vation is what seems to drive
most break-ins - not mal-
intent, but the desire to see
the University's spectacle
of a stadium and experience
it without a crowd topping
100,000 people.
Take the example of
Randy, an LSA senior who
has successfully snuck into
the Big House twice. The
first time was in the spring
of his freshman year; the
second was the night before
2013's Ohio State game.
Each time, Randy went
with only one other person.
"Neither time was planned,
it was just a really spontane-
ous event," he said. "It was
nice weather out both times,
and we were like, 'Oh, the Big
House would be fun to break
into.'"
For the second break-in,
this rationale was bolstered
by a bit of clouded judgment.
Randy was high.
He and his friend repli-
cated what seems to be the
normal ritual for Michigan
Stadium trespassers: They
circled in search of the low-
est point in the fence. Dis-
covering that it was adjacent
to the players' entrance to
the field, Randy and his
friend pulled up a trashcan
to assist their fence hopping.
"The fence was a bit of a
struggle, because I have big
feet and (the fences) have
spikes on top of them," he
said. "But, you know, it's real-
ly not that hard, especially
if you have a friend there to
steady you and stuff."
Randy said he did not
worry much about the conse-
quences at any point over the
course of both adventures.
"I had some worries that
I might get caught," he said.
"But I kind of thought to

Treasure Mart because we
get such a wide variety of
things because of the Uni-
versity and the hospital,"
Carl Johns, co-owner of
The Treasure Mart, said.

The two-story consign-
ment shop carries furniture,
household items, kitchen-
ware, books and more, with
a small vintage clothing and
shoe section. People con-
shouldn't be doing that to
your stadium. But if it's clear
that the student is just trying
to walk around and explore
and take it in, I wouldn't
approve of strong punish-
ment for that."
Like Forsberg explained,
it's quite possible that offi-
cers who discover students in
the Big House do assess their
intentions before enforcing
a punishment - and Matt's
case is tangible proof.
While students are likely
to continue to trespass into
Michigan Stadium grounds
on non-game-days, the Uni-
versity does not give stu-
dents an open opportunity

sign their items and receive
65 percent of the item's sale
price once it is sold.
"I would definitely say
there is a thrift and vintage
shop culture here," Cusack
said. "I've met alot of people
who get excited about super
great deals with you, and
to experience the empty sta-
dium. Mats's suggestion:
change that.
"You never get the chance
to actually walk on the field,
except after games, but
that's only if you feel like
staying after the crowd," he
said. "They should just take
students on a midnight trip
where you could walk into
the Big House just to look
around."
Rob Rademacher, asso-
ciate athletic director, said
in a statement that the Big
House's current security
policies and procedures are
under "constant evaluation"
so as to provide the "best

people who are willing to
wake up at 8 a.m. on a Sat-
urday morning to go thrift
shopping with you. The
challenge of finding some-
thing is fun for me."

security for Michigan Stadi-
um during an event an non-
event days."
As far as allowing stu-
dents in on non-game days,
Rademacher said the main
avenue for that kind of recre-
ation is H.A.I.L., the depart-
ment's free app that gives
students points for "atten-
dance, involvement and loy-
alty" - providing different
rewards at a variety of point
thresholds.
"A grand prize for certain
levels of achievement last
year was to have a flag foot-
ball game in the stadium,"
he said. "We will continue to
explore ideas like this."

Personal Statement: A prodigal townie
by Brooke Gabriel

'TREASURE
HUNT'
BY C A ROL Y N GEA RIG,
DAILY STAFF REPORTER

hile most students
are asleep at 9 a.m.
on Saturdays, LSA
sophomore Sara
Cusack can often be
found trekking across downtown
Ann Arbor to the weekly Kiwanis
Thrift Sale.
"I don't typically buy my clothes
new, but I put a lot of effort into
finding them," she said. "I like not
knowing what I'm going to get."
Cusack, who buys a majority of
her clothing secondhand, is part
of a wider culture of students
and residents in Ann Arbor who
eschew stores like Urban Outfit-
ters and Pitaya in favor of one-of-
a-kind, often inexpensive, clothing
from thrift and vintage stores,.
Open only on Saturdays from 9
a.m. to noon, Kiwanis, located on
the corner of South 1st Street and
Washington Street, is Cusack's
favorite Ann Arbor thrift store.
Downtown Ann Arbor has two
locally owned vintage shops: Dear
Golden and The Getup. In addi-
tion, it is home to several nearby
thrift stores: Salvation Army,
The Ann Arbor PTO Thrift Shop,
Kiwanis Thrift Sale, St. Vincent De
Paul Thrift Store and more. Thrift
shopping extends beyond clothing
at Treasure Mart, a home goods
consignment shop in Kerrytown,
and The Ann Arbor Reuse Center,
which carries donated household
items and building materials.
At the Ann Arbor Salvation
Army, located on State Street
across from the University golf
course, store supervisor Jillian
Morey-Greer said the store has a
distinctly different feel than the
fine other Sautheastavn Micbigan
stores she oversees.

"We have a lot of very trendy
individuals that come to this store
in particular," she said. "People
who are very individual, very into
clothes and very trendy."
Morey-Greer said she has
noticed a distinct culture of sec-
ondhand shopping that is unique to
Ann Arbor, a result of the Univer-
sity's influence on the town as well
as the influx ofstudents from other
areas of the country.
"Our shoppers and product is
dependent on the area," she said.
"A lot of people are very into thrift-
ing - and the people who donate
items to the store are the people
who shop here."
LSA junior Sola Muno is an Ann
Arbor native and a regular Salva-
tion Army shopper, although her
faiwrite Ann Arbor thrift store is
the Ann'Arbor PTO Thrift Shop,
which donates all proceeds to Ann
Arbor Public Schools. Muno is also
fashion editor for SHEI Magazine,
the University's student-run fash-
ion magazine.
"I've been thrift shopping at the
same places since as long as I can
remember," she said. "My mom
used to take me to the same stores
when I was little. I would say my
favorites have changed, though,
as Value World was my favorite in
high school. My style has gotten a
lot more polished since beginning
college.
"I love it because it's like
treasure hunting - you never
know what you will find," Muno
explained. "It allows me to take
risks - I don't feel bad spending
three dollars on something that I
love but am not 100 percent sure I
can pull off."
"I like to be green," LSA junior

Amelia Runco said. "It's good to
buy clothes that have already been
used. And it's cool to be wearing
something that not everyone else
has."
Along with Cusack, Runco is a
frequent customer at The Getup,
which is located close to campus on
State Street. Kelly McLeod, shop
owner and lifelong vintage lover,
opened the store in February 2005,
and said the culture of Ann Arbor
is a big part of why the store has
been open for almost 10 years.
"In any college town, you're
going to have people thinking
outside the box and people who
want to shop green," McLeod said.
"You're going to have people who
are funky, artsy, who want some-
thing different. This town really
loves secondhand, reusing, the
green aspect of it, which is really
exciting."
The Getup specializes in cloth-
ing from the 1940s to the 1970s,
although the store also carries
items from the 1980s and 1990s.
Clothing is purchased from estate
sales or individuals who bring in
items or arrange for an appoint-
ment, and ranges in price from 20
dollars to several hundred dollars.
Students make up nearly half of
customers.
"What helps with Ann . Arbor
is that there are so many trans-
plants," McLeod said. "Students
are here from New York, LA,
Seattle, places where vintage is
really big. They expect these sort
of stores."
"It sounds kind of silly, but I
think it's really cool to try and
imagine who used my clothes
before I did, and think about how

Week-
end, 2011:
a younger
me in a sassy black
dress and red lipstick
does her best to keep
from shaking as no less
than three grown-ass men
take their day out on her.
I remain calm while I tell them
that tables are moving more slow-
ly than I anticipated, and we are
doing our very best to get them
seated as quickly as possible. I get
my co-hosts to alert managers of
these and other testy guests, and
they take measures to make sure
that they'll be taken care of when
they sit down (a round of drinks
and an appetizer on the house
heals all waiting wounds, we've
found). I review my guest list. I'm
already over on three groups, and
I have another four whose time is
up within the next ten minutes.
It's time to focus.
I get the first three seated in
three, five and seven minutes
respectively, and my managers
make sure that they're brought
food and another apology the sec-
ond they sit down. As for the other
four groups: our charismatic bar-

tender sells one of them on eating
at the bar, I convince another to
try out our "Chef's counter" and
the other two are just five min-
utes past their quoted time, but
they're very understanding - it is
Parents' Weekend, after all.
At this point, I've;been hosting
for a year now, and I am a boss at-
it. I know a camper - a person
who hangs out and "camps" after
settling their bill - from a mile
away, and I can quote waits like,
well, it's my job. I know exactly
which words to use with guests
("absolutely," "sir," "you all")
and, perhaps more importantly,
which not to use ("yeah," "you
guys," "I don't know" and never,
ever "no problem" - that sug-
gests that there could have been
a problem in the first place, and
we don't want to do that, do we?).
Of course, I'm not immune to the
occasional problem - hosting is
really more of an art than a sci-
ence, anyway.
I worked in Ann Arbor restau-
rants because it's in my blood; my
mother and all of my aunts served
at Weber's to put themselves
through school back when they
attended the University. Approxi'.
mately one-third of my cousins

have been employed at The Black
Pearl at some point in time and
others have worked at the Gandy
Dancer, Connor O'Neil's and
NYPD. It seems that working in
the Ann Arbor restaurant scene
is a liminal state that members of
my family must pass through on
the road to adulthood while they
figure their lives out and earn
some saving money.
My time came in the. fall of
2010:I had just moved back home
to Ann Arbor after a very trying
freshman year at DePaul Uni-
versity. DePaul is a good school
with a lot of great things going for
it, but the two of us were simply
not meant to be as a couple. In
all fairness, my first year away
from home wasn't great outside
of DePaul either; I broke up with
my high school sweetheart and a
close friend passed away unex-
pectedly. The trauma from those
two experiences alone made
schoolwork very difficult, and I
knew that in order to do college.
right, I needed to take some time
to recover.
So I came home to Ann Arbor.
It took me a while to realize
that Coming 'back here wasn't
failing or quitting. I was one of

those Ann Arbor kids hell-bent
on escaping from their home-
town, who didn't want to ever get
"stuck" here as so many people
do. I thought that I was some-
how above a townie. And I even
thought that when I took my first
job, that this was just a tempo-
rary stop before I went off back
to school.
I entered my first job at the
now-closed Passport Restaurant
& Lounge like a newborn deer -
wide-eyed, unsteady on my feet
and completely overwhelmed-by
the strange new world around
me. I was so afraid of making mis-
takes, that in an attempt to gather
as much information from a guest
as possible (and thus avoid mak-
ing one), I irritated him to the
point of complaining about me to
a manager. Whoops.
But, slowly but surely, I got my
sea legs. I developed scripts for
greeting, seating, saying good-
bye and learned where to go to
get questions answered. I started
moving forward, deciding to leave
Passport for the more established
Quarter Bistro, and then moving
to Palio to be closer to my apart-
ment downtown. After Palio, I
got my restaurant dream job at

Mani Osteria.
Mani, as far as I'm concerned,
is the Mecca of Ann Arbor restau-
rant gigs. Privately owned, ele-
gant space, killer food... I thrived
there. I arrived at Mani with two
years experience under my belt,
and it wasn't long after I started
that I found myself running the
door and kicking ass at it. It was
also' at Mani that I realized just
how un-stuck I was, both in Ann
Arbor, and in life in general. I
realized that through hard work,
I could move up through the
rankings, go from host to food-
runner, then server, maybe even
manager some day.
Or I could transfer the credits
I'd earned at DePaul somewhere
else and finish my degree. There
was a pretty good school up the
street, after all.
I transferred to the University
in the fall of 2012, and I left the --w
restaurant scene just a year later.
Now, I walk past the places I once
worked at and realize why this
town has the townie following it
does - it changes as you do, and
new doors open when you look for
them.

Ann Arbor's not-so-secret society
by Margo Levy

hat do former-Pres-
ident Gerald Ford and
/ Denard Robinson have
in common? To start, they
both attended the Universi-
ty. While here, they also both
played on the football team. Finally,
their senior year extracurricular overlapped
- they were both members of The Order of
Angell.
The Order of Angell is a senior leader-
ship honors society that was created in
1902 by a group of seniors who were in cor-
respondence with James Burrill Angell,
the University's president at the time. One
might wonder what type of club would seek
out both a public policy major and a foot-
ball quarterback for its membership. Yet
the Order's members are compromised of a
diverse group of campus leaders from a vari-
ety of backgrounds.
LSA senior Natasha Dabrowski, a current
Order of Angell member, said the group was
created to join leaders from across campus,
and to provide a community for them to cre-
ate connections that strengthen and improve
organizations and the University.
"Order of Angell strives to advance excep-
tional leadership through a lifetime loyalty
to and engagement with the University of
Michigan," she said.
Yet the history of this organization is sur-
rounded by historical allegations of racist
rituals, sexist policies and an elitist selection
process. Recently The Order of Angell has
done much to rid itself of this controversial
legacy. According to a 2012 article published
in The Michigan Daily, the organization,

originally named Michigamua, changed its
name in 2006 to Order of Angell, a symbolic
separation from its former controversies.
It has also released the list of each year's
members every April. Today, Order of Angell
members see themselves as creators of open
dialogue rather than an exclusive society,
according to Dabrowski.
"Order of Angell seeks to reflect upon the
campus climate and engage with students
and administrators at the University," Dab-
rowski said. "As individual leaders and as an
organization, Order of Angell and its mem-
bers continually strive to positively impact
the campus community."
Each year a new group of incoming
seniors are selected by current members to
make up the next year's members.
LSA senior, WOLV-TV Producer and cur-
rent Order of Angell member Shelby Roberts
said there is 100 percent turnover each year,
so the group gets brand new members com-
ing into the organization.
Members described their invitation to
become a member as very casual. In fact,
Dabrowski explained that she was just hav-
ing coffee with a few of her friends who hap-
pened to be members when they asked if she
would consider joining.
When juniors are asked to join, they are
encouraged to talk to current members in
order to receive as much information to
make an informed decision.
"Every organization has a past and a
future, and of course you have to consider
the past," Dabrowski said, "but you have to
focus on the present and the future that you
will actually be apart of.

"The Order of Angell is one of the most
diverse organizations that I have ever been
a part of at the University. We really have
members from all over the University from
different backgrounds and organizations."
Like any other organization or group,
Order of Angell has to revive certain practic-
es over time in order to improve as a collec-
tive and also serve the campus community.
In 2012, The Michigan Daily documented
the rumors and hearsay that have spread
across campus about a secret room in the
attic of the Union where meetings are held.
But, a rumor is exactly what it is. Accord-
ing to Roberts, each of The Order of Angell
meetings are held at a different location
around campus so members can have an
opportunity to see parts of the University
that they may not have necessarily had a rea-
son to go to otherwise. LSA junior Melissa
Weintraub said she saw the 2013 members
meeting in the basement of Hillel.
"In the past it seemed like people tend to
move around, just to try and get the feel for
campus overall because every student leader
tends to get caught up in their own personal
bubble, so it is nice to see that there is more
to central campus than just one aspect,"
Roberts said. "It is cool to go to North Cam-
pus, go to South Campus, different parts of
central, and see what the buildings you pass
by every day but don't even think to go in and
step inside."
According to Roberts and Dabrowski,
when meeting, members sit down for a dia-
logue about the problems they are facing
within their own organizations. In the past,
Order of Angell has received criticism for

their elusive activity since they previously
did not publish a list of their members.
But current members deny the secretive
nature of the organization. "We're really not
exciting - literally we come together and we
just talk about what challenges we are facing
in our (organization), we sit down have cof-
fee and we talk." Roberts said.
"Our programming is transparent, so as
an organization we should be transparent."
Dabrowski said.
When members were asked about rituals
or traditions, they responded with laughter.
"It seems easier to be public so people
can stop asking ridiculous questions ... it is
easier to operate and collaborate, and there
is less speculation, we're just sitting down
and working together and problem solving
together and trying to get different perspec-
tives, rather than just having a bunch of nay-
sayers running around," said John Borger,
current LSA Senior and Order of Angell
member.
Dabrowski said that The Order of Angell
does not formally give money to or spon-
sor programs such as Dance Marathon or
K-grams, but they started in the past as a
result of Order members collaborating with
other leaders around campus.
LSA Senior Paola Mendez, executive
director of K-grams said she has heard of the
Order of Angell but has yet to interact with
the organization.
"I really don't know anything about it to
be honest ... All I've really heard about it is
that it is kind of secretive." Mendez said.
This year's members hope that won't be
the case for much longer.

circling the Big House,
with a simple mission: get
in.
The date was August 30, 2013,
teetering on the 31st. It was the
night before Michigan Football
would open its season against Cen-
tral Michigan University.
Among the trespassers-to-be
was Matt, at the time an LSA and
Neuroscience senior, he and a
friend - one who had snuck into
Michigan Stadium before - met
up with three other students in
the parking lot. From there, it was
game time.
One by one, they climbed the
fence near Section 27. For those
who aren't familiar with the
metal barriers to entry, the fences
are made up of cylindrical, verti-
cal poles that make it difficult to
ascend with grace.
. Matt his friends nearly fell more
than once, but thanks to what be
described as a team effort, those
who stayed became champions.

"We stood up there by the gate
for a while," he said. "Just observ-
ing. We were all shocked because
we actually did it ... but we wanted
to go on the field."
The rush of adrenaline sur-
passed whatever fear Matt had
of being caught. At that point, the
"eerie, creepy feeling" that accom-
panied the empty Leviathan of
a stadium would not tarnish the
group's triumph.
The group ran around the field,
laid down by the Block 'M' at the
50-yard-line and took obligatory
break-in pictures - because this is
Michigan, for God's sake. And then,
it was ruined.
"My friend starts running
toward the stairs," Matt said. "As
he was running off the field, I was
running after him, and I see a big
flashlight from the bleachers. It
blinded us."
It was a police officer. Matt
stopped in his tracks, as did the
others, and the light descended
from the bleachers. The students
lined up in the end zone, and the
cop shined his flashlight from the
first row of student section seats.

they were trespassing. "No sir, I'm

peeking through the
FAIRY DOOR
BY OMAR MAHMOOD, DAILY ARTS WRITER

Fairy door located inside of Sweetwaters Coffee & Tea on West Washington.

There is a fairy door by the box
office at Michigan Theatre. I sat
in that little corner on a Sunday
afternoon, watching the people as the
fairies do. A good-looking couple, just
a tad too old to be undergraduates, reit4
the listings as they stood holding hands
by a poster for Boyhood.He wore a gayly
colored shirt and a fedora, and she wore
a black-and-white patterned dress with a
brown buckled belt.
A car revved by on Liberty, its windows
down in the afternoon sun, the radio blast-
ing. The couple didn't look around at the
car. Instead, as if they overlooked the rest
of the world, he took her and and twirled
her around, and they danced a slow dance
not altogether in accord with the music.
The world has a way of coming alive when
one watches from a fairy door.
Old German folklore tells us that once
upon a time, in the woodlands, there lived
fairies. But more than that is only humble
guesswork. Still, I wondered what fairies
really look like. And I would trust only my
own eyes to tell me. So I set out to find a
fairy for myself. As it happens, Ann Arbor
is the place for such a quest. The world's
only bonafide fairyologist has lived here all
his life.
Ann Arbor resident Christopher H.
U/Daily Wrightbecame interested in fairies in 1993,
when the first-ever fairy door appeared in
his too-year-old fairytale home on the Old
West Side. It had been built into the base-
board of a hallway leading to a stairwell -
six inches tall and whitewashed, framed
modestly, and topped off with a bronze
doorknob. It opened up to a checkered floor
and a flight of black-and-white stairs.
Many years later, The Fairy Doors ofAnn
Arbor is now a book published by Wright
that documents his fairyology research. It
is largely based on eyewitness drawings
and descriptions that he then renders, as
an artist, into fuller-fledged illustrations.
In the book, Wright tells us that imagina-
tion is the key to these fairies. But I was
more skeptical.
My first stop was the storied Michigan
Theatre. Underneath the lightbulb-stud-
ded canopy, right beside the box office, is a
set ofvarnished double doors. It sits tucked
away in the middle of the fanfare. Fair-
ies are notoriously shy of human folk, so I
approached the little door with some trepi-
dation. I knelt down and peered inside. The
door was hardly ornate, with humble knobs
and hinges, but an ode to the Theatre all
the same. Panes of glass revealed a picture
frame, which I suppose is how the fairies
watch their films.
I saw a scattering of 'fairy droppings' -
pennies, alittle pink hairpin, small golden-
brown leaves from past fall, a shiny blue
pebble, some M&Ms and a wad of Orbitz.
I also noticed a green glitter that I would
later see at every subsequent fairy door I
visited.
I leaned my back on the wall of the post
office and folded my legs, my Peshawari
U/Oaily chappals not so out of place. I gazed up at
the ceramic ceiling, painted all sorts of gold

and pink and red and swirled into flowers
and ribbons. I hadn't noticed it before, but
fairy dust does put one in a ceiling-gazing
mood.
There was a festival going on that Sun-
day as the fall term came around. Main
Street was merry. I came to find myself
in the original Sweetwaters on Main and
Washington. I looked about in vain for
a fairy door, finally coming up with the
shamelessness to ask the girl at the bar.
She rolled her eyes at your twenty-year-
old fairy hunter and pointed behind me.
There it was: not only a little fairy door, but
a dainty little fairy coffee shop next to it as
well.
As I looked on, a little girl in a glittery
purple dress and colorfully rimmed sun-
glasses scurried over to the fairy door and
knelt down, as her parents looked on. I
moved to the side, recognizing that before
her I was but a patzer. The fairies were
cooking, she told us.
I found that her parents had recently
moved to Ann Arbor and were excited
about fairy doors. They were even think-
ing about getting one at their new house,
though that of course is best left to the
fairies. Their daughter, Adia, agreed very
kindly to be interviewed. Five years old,
her blue eyes twinkled with delight as she
giggled into her mother's ear. With some
humility, she gave earth-shattering testi-
mony of the time she saw a fairy. It was a
girl fairy.
"She had pink and blue wings and a pink
and blue dress," Adia told me.
As we talked, I learned that the fairy had
wings. Adia had given her a penny.
"We found it in the book library," she
continued, this time without prompting
from her mother. "They didn't tell people
because the fairies get mad., But they told
me anyway."
Emboldened by the promise of Adia's
testimony, I made my way down to Peace-
able Kingdom to visit another fairy door.
Here the offerings seemed to have been
all collected, but that familiar green glit-
ter was present all the same. The fairy
door's resemblance to the door of the busi-
ness is immediate, though the fairies have
embellished it with some seemly railings,
and built upon the step. These urban-fair-
ies have not forgotten the charm of their
woodland forefathers, though I would have
to ask Adia to be sure.
There aren't too many better ways of
discovering Ann Arbor than by hunting for
fairies. But be careful of what you might
find. As I roamed about in search of more
doors, I stopped by the Black Pearl. A help-
ful waiter there told me he had seen a door
close by, and walked me down a couple
stores to a little crevice beside Life is Good.
This door was taller by a bit than the other
doors I had seen, and also a bit ominous.
I paced back and forth on Main Street,
examining the neighboring storefronts, but
the door seemed to have a design of its own
this time. And it was a little too hidden.
This, Wright believes, could be Ann
Arbor's first goblin door.


n the corner of Washtenaw Avenue
and Hill Street, in the middle of
George Washington Park, stands a
gaudy paint-covered rock.
First brought to Ann Arbor in 1932 from a
landfill in Pontiac Trail - unpainted, with a
plaque commemorating George Washington's
200th birthday added shortly thereafter -
over the past 92 years it has become something
else entirely. The Rock, now capital R, is a
monument to hundreds, if not thousands,
of different student organizations, causes,
messages, and last year, a marriage proposal.
It's not clear who started painting it or when,
though most sources place the start of the
tradition at about the 1950s when, according
to a 1987 letter to the editor in the Ann Arbor
News, several Michigan State University fans
painted MSU on it, necessitating a fresh coat of
paint over the letters by University fans.
By the summer of 1993, the practice of
painting the rock had attracted enough
attention that the city of Ann Arbor held
a public hearing on it to address resident
concerns, resulting in a management plan
created by then-Superintendent of Parks and
Recreation Ronald A. Olson. The plan called
for the placement of a trash container, clean up
of the Rock's base, and other regulations that
are mostly still in place today, allowing the

paintingtradition to continue.
While the multitude of writing it has
accumulated over the years hasn't lent it a
lot of physical depth - in reality, the paint
coveringthe Rock is only a few inches thick, as
found by a Daily reporter who drilled through
the paint in 2010-- its significance as a campus
tradition both for students and alumni, as well
as local residents, is uncontested.
Jessica Black, facility supervisor for Ann
Arbor's parks and recreation department, said
to the best of her knowledge, the Rock is the
only object of its kind across the city's parks.
She said while the city neither condones nor
condemns painting the Rock, its existence
brings something unique to the park and that
uniqueness comes with positive aspects, such
as the fact that both the Rock and the park
don't get tagged with graffiti very often.
"There's a sense of ownership in painting
it, for the college students and high school
students," Black said.
The city's policy isto remove paint that ends
up on the greenway around it. Otherwise, all
the paint that makes it onto the Rock is left
alone until painted over, usually within the
day. Black said she couldn't remember a time,
over her tenure with the Parks Department,
that anything that would be considered
offensive enough to warrant removal had been

painted on the Rock itself.
Second-year medical student Max Shlykov
is the vice president of the medical school
chapter ofWolverines for Life, which regularly
paints the Rock. The organization works with
the campus community and several organ
and blood donation groups, including the
Michigan Eye Bank and the Red Cross, to
promote donating. They typically paint the
Rock before their Be a Hero at the Big House
event, which usually occurs right before the
Michigan vs. Ohio State University football
game. During the event, Wolverines for Life
and a similar organization at OSU compete to
see who can register the most blood and organ
donors, as well as bone marrow donors as of
last year.
"I was like 'Hmm. Interesting,"' Shlykov
said about his initial reaction to coordinating
the painting of the Rock. "But I knew that it
was somethingtraditional, something special,
somethingthatkind of gets people's attention."
He said for the group, the main point of
painting the Rock was to raise awareness
and bring people to the event to sign up to be
donors.
"It's very visible whenever you drive by,
it's a part of the campus that gets a lot of foot
traffic, it's very noticeable," Shlykov said. "It's
a very iconic piece of Michigan. I'm new here,

this is only my first year, but I'm kind of finding
out the little iconic pieces of Michigan here."
LSA junior Tucker Schumacher, who
is currently working on starting an
undergraduate chapter of Wolverines for
Life, agreed. Schumacher, who is a transplant
recipient himself, has been painting the Rock
with Wolverines for Life since he was in high
school.
"They had me come down and do that
with them a couple years ago, and that was
pretty cool," he said. "I already knew it was
for Wolverines for Life, so I was pretty much
game to do anything to help them out, but it
was cool to be involved."
"Because it's so big on U of M's campus,
painting the Rock's a big deal," he added.
LSA senior Saif Jilani, whose organization,
the Pakistani Students' Organization, also
paints the Rock, said in an e-mail interview
that along with raising awareness for the
group, painting the Rock was also a great .w
experience for him because of the strong
tradition associated with it on campus. Last
year, the organization painted Pakistan's flag.
"Before attending Michigan I was told to
make sure I visit the Rock," Jilani wrote. "I
feel like painting the Rock is an intrinsic part
of the Michigan experience and my time here -
would be incomplete without doing it."
