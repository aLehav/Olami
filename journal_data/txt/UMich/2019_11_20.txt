ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

The Diag was occupied by 
more than 30 students Tuesday 
night participating in the first 
“One Night Without a Home” 
sleep-out in Ann Arbor. The 
event, hosted by the Shelter 
Association 
of 
Washtenaw 
County, as well as student 
activist organizations MReach 

and CURIS - Public Health 
Advocacy, comes as one of many 
organized by SAWC this week 
as a part of the National Hunger 
and Homelessness Awareness 
Week. 
The 
event, 
which 
accompanied 
other 
“Nights 
Without a Home” held across 
the country, featured speeches 
from University of Michigan 
student organizations The Dot 

Org and Poverty Solutions, 
testimonials 
from 
former 
SAWC clients, activities to help 
students confront the realities of 
homelessness and a candlelight 
vigil held in honor of lives lost to 
homelessness. Over the course 
of the evening, attendees were 
invited to confront their biases 
toward 
people 
experiencing 
homelessness.
Sarah Papsal, SAWC Director 

of 
Development, 
said 
the 
event is meant to “simulate 
homelessness” to the fullest 
extent possible in a single night. 
Papsal explained that while 
students may never understand 
what it is like to go weeks 
without a shower or clean 
clothes, they can empathize 
with the fear of spending a 
night alone in the cold.
The 
School 
of 
Public 
Health 
held 
a 
lecture 
Tuesday evening addressing 
Michigan’s 
investigations 
and response to per- and 
polyfluoroalkyl 
substances 
(PFAS) contaminating sources 
of drinking water. The keynote 
speaker at the lecture was 
Betsy Wasilevich, a senior 
epidemiologist at the Michigan 
Department of Health and 
Human Services. The audience 
consisted of about 30 people, 
including students and faculty 
members. 
The lecture started off with 
Wasilevich introducing PFAS 
and talking about a few of its 
sources. 
“PFAS is a group of chemicals, 
over a thousand analytes of 
these types of chemicals, they 
are incredibly stable, have a 
generally long half-life, they 
break down slowly and they 
bioaccumulate,” 
Wasilevich 
said. “We all have some level 
of exposure to PFAS. Teflon 
coating, fire-fighting foams, 
food packaging. It is also in the 
water.”
Wasilevich 
highlighted 
the challenges in addressing 
PFAS, which is an emerging 
contaminant.

The FemDems and JustDems, 
two issue committees of the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
chapter 
of 
the 
College 
Democrats, hosted a panel titled 
“Rethinking Public Policy in 
an Age of Mass Incarceration” 
Tuesday night. 
The 
panel 
consisted 
of 
Francine 
Banner, 
associate 
professor of Sociology at U-M 
Dearborn, and Mark Fancher, 
a staff attorney for the Racial 
Justice Project of the ACLU of 
Michigan. They discussed the 
issue of mass incarceration and 
the policies and factors that 
contribute to it, specifically 
those that harm women and the 
Black community. The panel 
was attended by a group of about 
50 students and community 
members at the Ford School of 
Public Policy.
LSA senior Emma Rooney, 
the co-chair of JustDems, told 
The Michigan Daily they invited 
Banner and Fancher due to their 
previous experience with the 
criminal justice system.
“Banner taught in prison 
systems, and Mark Fancher has 
experience with the ACLU and 
doing direct court cases, and 
we wanted to focus on policies,” 
Rooney said.

Saudi 
Arabian 
journalist 
Safa Al Ahmad gave a talk 
after accepting the Wallenberg 
Medal from President Mark 
Schlissel Tuesday night. She 
spoke in Rackham Auditorium 
to a crowd of a few hundred 
community 
members 
and 
students. 
The Wallenberg Medal is 
named after 1935 University 
of Michigan graduate Raoul 
Wallenberg, who saved more 
than 80,000 lives in Nazi-
occupied Hungary during World 
War II. The award is given to 
those who “demonstrate the 
capacity of the human spirit 
to stand up for the helpless, 
to defend the integrity of the 
powerless, and to speak out 
on behalf of the voiceless.” Al 
Ahmad is the 27th recipient 
of the award, joining notable 
recipients 
like 
Elie 
Wiesel, 
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and 

the Dalai Lama.
“If I’m going to be honest, 
this 
completely 
feels 
like 
imposter syndrome,” Al Ahmad 
said. “I don’t know why I was 
chosen … all I can say is that I’m 
overwhelmed and honored, and 
I hope I deserve it.”
As 
a 
journalist 
and 
filmmaker, 
Al 
Ahmad 
has 
produced documentaries about 
the uprisings in the Middle 
East. She said her reporting on 
the complexities of the conflict 
in areas of Yemen has put her 
in great danger, yet she has 
continued to cover this area. 
“It’s constantly keeping me 
on my toes as a storywriter,” Al 
Ahmad said. “You never think 
‘Oh, that’s it. I’ve seen it all in 
Yemen.’ You have not and you 
never will. So, on a personal, 
selfish level, I find it’s really 
important to keep engaged and 
interested, intrigued by a story.”

Solomon Rajput, a 27-year-old 
medical student at the University 
of Michigan, began his campaign 
for U.S. Congress about a month 
ago. He spoke about his campaign 
Tuesday night at a town hall 
event he co-hosted with the 
Young Democratic Socialists of 
America.
LSA junior Elias Khoury is the 
president of YDSA and helped 
organize the event. After hearing 

about Rajput’s campaign, Khoury 
said he wanted to get involved. 
Khoury was interested in the 
fact that Rajput is a primary 
challenger to incumbent U.S. Rep. 
Debbie Dingell, D-Ann Arbor.
“I reached out to Solomon, 
who was accessible and easy to 
get in touch with,” Khoury said. 
“We were talking back and forth, 
and eventually we got him to 
come to one of our meetings, and 
he did a little presentation about 
what his canvas is all about. The 
vast majority of our membership 

were, more or less, on board. So, 
since then, we’ve been working 
pretty closely with him, and we 
decided it would be a nice idea to 
put this town hall together.”
Rajput began by speaking 
about his reasons for running. 
Currently, Rajput is taking a leave 
of absence from the University 
of Michigan Medical School in 
order to pursue his campaign. He 
said the main reason he got into 
the race was because of climate 
change, noting he has always 
been passionate about climate 

issues and wants to become a 
doctor in a green world.
“The number one reason why 
I got into this race was because 
of this little thing called climate 
change,” Rajput said. “It might 
kill us all if we don’t figure out 
what to do. … This baby step 
approach where we have a 90 
year plan and we do something 
this year and then re-evaluate in 
50 years when everyone else is 
dead, it’s not going to happen.”

Student 
organizations 
Elevate, 
South 
Asian 
Awareness 
Network 
and 
Paani 
jointly 
hosted 
a 
collaborative workshop to 
discuss feminism through a 
South-Asian lens on Tuesday 
night.
The event was part of a 
four-part series exploring 
global 
perspectives 
on 
feminism. About 50 people 
engaged in the discussion 
and Q&A led by Debotri Dhar, 
women’s studies lecturer, and 
Zunaira Jilani, a Wayne State 
health and social psychology 
Ph.D. student. The speakers 
addressed the importance of 
intersectional feminism in 
the South-Asian community 
both in the region itself and 
in the U.S. 

Engineering junior Kyra 
Kothawala 
attended 
the 
event in hopes of exploring 
more 
about 
other 
social 
justice issues outside the U.S.
“I recently went to an 
event from SARS (Students 
Against 
Rape 
Society), 
and I thought it was really 
empowering, and I am kind 
of 
interested 
in 
learning 
more about feminism around 
the world,” Kothawala said.
Dhar began the discussion 
by addressing the difficulty 
of explaining South Asian 
feminism in a limited time 
period, given the diversity 
of the countries and the non-
linear nature of feminist 
movements in the region. 
She went on to comment on 
the impact of colonialism 
on grassroots-level feminist 
movements in south-Asian 
countries 
which 
were 

not only focused on local 
challenges but set in the 
context of a larger, global 
framing.
“It’s 
like 
teaching 
a 
full semester course in 15 
minutes. Sometimes, these 

movements are similar to 
what we see in the West but 
sometimes break away in 
order to articulate local 
needs,” Dhar said.
Stressing 
the 
importance 
of 
understanding 
how 
culture 
is 
not 
static, 
Dhar 
rejected 
the 
idea 
of 
cultural 
universalism 
when 
drawing 
comparisons 
about feminism between 
Western 
countries 
and 
other 
regions. 
After 
talking 
about 
specific 
movements 
in 
fields 
such as literature, film 
and policymaking, Dhar 
talked about how male 
allies are doing incredible 
work 
across 
different 
avenues in the region.
LSA senior Taha Bashir 
also attended the event 
and was interested in 
learning what he can do 
as an ally to support the 
women from the South 
Asian community. 
“As a guy, I would love 
the opinion of someone 
who is a woman and to 

understand the daily life 
and the daily struggles of 
someone from the South 
Asian 
culture, 
and 
so 
I 
can know what to do in 
solidarity,” Bashir said. 
Zunaira Jilani’s focus was 
on South Asian culture in 
the U.S. and sexual violence. 
She talked about her early 
experiences 
discussing 
this topic with her mom 
while watching “Law and 
Order” and realizing the 
taboo behind discussing sex 
in the community. When 
asked about fueling cultural 
change, 
Zunaira 
Jilani 
emphasized talking about the 
issue in specific community 
groups 
and 
eliminating 
girl-on-girl hate as possible 
solutions.
“Embracing your strong 
cultural 
identity 
and 
channeling it to form strong 
alliances is very important,” 
Zunaira Jilani said.
Sumrah 
Jilani, 
event 
organizer from SAAN and 
LSA senior, talked about 
some takeaways from the 
event.
“I learned that there are 
a lot of different cultural 
norms that differ in South-
Asian culture compared to a 
Eurocentric perspective, and 
I think the speakers did a 
good job of highlighting that 
it’s okay to be different from 
the norm,” Jilani said.
Moving 
forward, 
Dhar 
emphasized the importance 
of 
understanding 
the 
complicated 
nature 
of 
feminism in south Asia. 
“Feminism in south Asia 
is not a linear narrative. It’s 
messier as it is anywhere 
around the world, but I’d like 
to believe that it is a forward 
movement, 
despite 
the 
complications,” Dhar said.

GEO criticizes University’s bargaining stance

Nov. 20, 1995
After 
four 
rounds 
of 
contract 
negotiations, 
members of the Graduate 
Employees 
Organization 
say 
University 
administrators 
are 
not 
giving them the respect 
they deserve.
Mike 
Sell, 
secretary 
of 
the 
GEO 
bargaining 
team, said that although 
GEO is presenting issues 
related to the educational 
and 
economic 
issue 
of 
the 
University, 
“the 
administration 
seems 
to 
feel 
these 
are 
just 
complaints.”
Dan 
Gamble, 
the 

administration’s 
chief 
negotiator, disputed GEO’s 
claims yesterday. 
“I think both teams are 
working very hard to reach 
tentative agreements,” he 
said. “I’m not sure where 
they’re coming from.”
Issues on the bargaining 
table 
include 
wage 
and 
workload changes, hiring 
policies, changing the title 
of teaching assistant, and 
ensuring proper benefits 
and employee recognition 
for interns.
In a statement issued late 
last week, GEO officials 
said Gamble “made clear 
that 
the 
administration 

bargaining 
team 
has 
little interest in working 
with the Union to resolve 
problems that affect not 
only 
Graduate 
Student 
Instructors, 
but 
the 
University as a whole.”
Gamble said he never 
made such comments.
Sell, a Rackham fellow 
and student and English 
TA, said the union has no 
sense that its issues are 
being taken seriously. 
During 
negotiations 
last Wednesday, the issue 
of 
recognizing 
clinical 
psychology 
interns 
as 
employees 
came 
up 
for 
discussion.

After GEO presented its 
views in what he called a 
logical process, Sell said 
Gamble listened and said 
no, without explanation. 
Gamble said he thought 
he 
had 
explained 
his 
position adequately. “It is 
a unit determination made 
by the Michigan Employee 
Relations Commission,” he 
said. “I’m sorry if I didn’t 
make it clear.”
Sell said GEO is “less 
than optimistic that these 
issues 
can 
be 
resolved 
at the table, unless the 
administration is willing to 
change its tune...and step 
off their high horse.”

Sell added that GEO would 
be willing to compromise if 
the administration shows a 
willingness to do the same.
In the meantime, Sell 
said, “GEO will negotiation 
to the best of (its) abilities.”
“GEO has 38 proposals, 
so we have a ways to go,” 
Gamble said. 
Negotiations for the 10th 
GEO contract began Oct. 31, 
with the current contract 
set to expire Feb. 1.
The 
fifth 
bargaining 
session is scheduled for 
today at 5 p.m. on the 
second floor of the LSA 
building. 
“Many students of color 

face tremendous financial 
burdens, 
the 
cultural 
climate, and I do think 
there needs to be more 
support of our academic 
support services,” Monts 
said. “We must increase our 
efforts to infuse diversity 
and multiculturalism into 
our teaching and learning 
programs. 
As 
society 
changes 
the 
University 
must 
change 
to 
reflect 
society.”
Overall, 
enrollment 
dropped 290 students from 
36,758 in 1993 to 36,468 in 
1994.

“Embracing your 
strong cultural 
identity and 
channeling it 
to form strong 
alliances is very 
important.”


LSA 
junior 
Rain 
Uddin 
decided to get involved in this 
campaign when she learned 
that Michigan’s 12th District 
was represented by a Democrat 
rather 
than 
a 
Democratic 
Socialist.
“I am really interested in 
seeing the progressive take this 
seat, especially in this district,” 
Uddin said. “I am a transfer 
here, and once I experienced 
the community it was shocking 
to me that we had such an 
established Democrat as our 
representative, so that’s the 
main reason that I am here.”
In an email, Kellie Lounds, 
the 
political 
director 
for 
Dingell’s campaign, said the 
congresswoman was focused on 
serving the people of the 12th 
District.
“Congresswoman 
Dingell 
is focused on continuing to 
lead the fight in Congress for 
quality, affordable healthcare, 
safeguarding the environment, 
strengthening affordable and 
accessible 
education, 
and 
delivering 
for 
hard-working 
men and women in Southeast 
Michigan,” 
Lounds 
wrote. 

“Across the 12th Congressional 
District, 
Mrs. 
Dingell 
talks 
with everyone, and has gone 
to hundreds of meetings and 
events - including events from 
Downriver 
communities 
to 
multiple 
events 
on 
UMich 
campus weekly. People who 
know her, know she is a fighter.”
As 
Rajput 
continued, 
he 
emphasized his various beliefs. 
He said he was focused on 
college debt and talked about 
more affordable or free college. 
“How are we going to pay 
for it? Well, the answer is using 
the vast wealth and resources 
of the United States because we 
are a rich country,” Rajput said. 
“We are the richest country that 
has ever existed in the history 
of mankind, and we’re going 
around pretending that we are 
barely getting by. … We have 
so much money, but we keep 
spending it on dumb stuff.”
He shared a story about 
a woman he met during his 
campaign. 
She 
mentioned 
she was married, but that it 
was not a romantic marriage. 
When applying to college, she 
got married to a friend so they 
would receive more financial aid 
because she would then qualify 
as a dependent.
Rajput said no one should 

have to get married in order to 
pay for college. 
“Is this actually something 
that 
is 
happening 
at 
this 
University?” Rajput said. “The 
answer is yes. … That’s where 
we’re at. Where people are 
trying to do whatever to figure 
out how to make this make 
financial sense for them.”
University 
alum 
Stephen 
Tryban 
attended 
the 
town 
hall to learn more about the 
candidate challenging Dingell. 
“As someone who is pretty far 
left, I am curious and interested 
in any kind of disruption there 
could be in the establishment 
Democrat field,” Tryban said. “I 
think that even if this campaign 
is not successful, I think that 
primarily 
having 
somebody 
like Solomon come in and 
really gather a lot of attention 
for these particular stances 
could inevitably shift Dingell’s 
position, possibly. So, I think, if 
anything, it could gather more 
support for these particular 
issues.”
Rajput concluded by sharing 
his opinions on health care. 
Implementing universal health 
care is crucial, he said. 
“We need to try to make our 
healthcare system better from 
the inside out,” Rajput said.

Experts are unsure how 
PFAS 
exposure 
impacts 
people clinically, Wasilevich 
said. 
“Sometimes it means that 
our lab testing procedures are 
not as refined,” Wasilevich 
said. “We are learning and 
evolving those procedures 
to test for new analytes. We 
also don’t have a clear sense, 
at least for PFAS, about the 
clinical implications of being 
exposed. That makes the 
risk of communication very 
challenging.”
Wasilevich 
then 
proceeded to talk about the 
public health obligations of 
the Michigan PFAS Action 
Response Team.
“We have a public health 
obligation, so once (MPART) 
identifies 
contaminated 
sites, we intervene to try 
to reduce or remove that 
exposure, protecting public 
health,” Wasilevich said. “If 
we locate a contaminated 
site, we will replace that 
water either with bottled 
water or will shift the water 
source, and we will also 
distribute filters.”
Wasilevich 
spoke 
about 
how 
PFAS 
contamination 
affects communities and how 
MPART assuages the fears of 
a contaminated community.
“When a community is 
affected with a contaminant, 
they become very fearful. 
It’s out of their control that 
they’ve been exposed, and 
they 
want 
answers, 
and 
they 
deserve 
answers,” 
Wasilevich said. “We go into 
town halls frequently for 
health education to let them 
know about their testing. We 
create a very strong presence 
in the communities that are 
affected.”
Wasilevich 
also 
talked 
about 
MPART’s 
surface 
water investigations where 
they check for PFAS levels in 

fish and wastewater.
“We 
do 
some 
surface 
water 
investigations,” 
Wasilevich said. “We test 
fish in the water and address 
PFAS foam in the water, and 
we test our wastewater as 
well, and based on what we 
find, we put in public health 
advisories.”
Public Health senior Anna 
Tankersley 
commented 
on possible improvements 
MPART could make in its 
response to PFAS.
“I think that they are 
doing a really good job, but 
I’d like to see them be a little 
more transparent about it,” 
Tankersley said. “I’d like to 
see more publications, kind 
of publicly available. Overall, 
I’d like to see the studies to 
see what they’re doing.”
Wasilevich 
spoke 
about 
where MPART is presently in 
their area of assessment.
“We 
are 
currently 
analyzing 
the 
data. 
We 
are 
pulling 
together 
a 
preliminary report for the 
community to share with 
them 
before 
the 
end 
of 
the year,” Wasilevich said. 
“Hopefully, we’ll be able to 
share the full report by the 
end of the next year.”
Wasilevich further spoke 
about MPART’s expansion 
plans, including a five-year 
grant to establish two new 
biomonitoring initiatives in 
Michigan. 
Meredith 
McGehee, 
a 
senior 
administrative 
assistant at the School of 
Public Health’s Department 
of Epidemiology, commented 
on Michigan’s response to 
the PFAS presence. 
“They’re doing a great job,” 
McGehee said. “They’ve got 
the steps down in the right 
order, they are doing the 
testing, and they have two 
studies that are in their first 
stages.”
The event came to an end 
with a Q&A session. The first 
question asked involved how 
MPART planned to address 
the clustering of samples. 

Wasilevich 
responded 
that 
MPART 
aimed 
to 
statistically address the issue 
of clustering, for example 
analyzing households rather 
than individuals. 
“One of the things that 
we’ve done in the North 
Kent County assessment is 
use households as a means 
of analysis as opposed to 
individuals,” 
Wasilevich 
said. “So, there are some 
statistical means that we 
might employ to address 
that.”
Wasilevich 
was 
further 
asked how the researchers 
planned to boost enrollment 
in the study. 
“We are going to do a lot of 
non-targeted recruitment as 
well as targeted recruitment 
in 
the 
community,” 
Wasilevich said. “We are 
incentivizing with gift cards. 
We’re hoping that helps.”
In 
an 
interview 
with 
The Daily after the event, 
Wasilevich 
addressed 
the 
struggles 
MPART 
faces 
in 
recruiting 
people 
to 
participate in studies. 
“One of the challenges 
is to make sure we have 
people across the spectrum 
of 
possible 
exposure,” 
Wasilevich said. “One of the 
things we also had struggles 
with when we did a random 
sample of participants in 
North 
Kent 
County 
was 
that 
we 
didn’t 
include 
everyone, which meant that 
some people who wanted to 
participate couldn’t.”

Wasilevich 
also 

commented 
on 
how 
Michigan’s response to the 
threat of PFAS has been 
exemplary and what needs to 
be done in the future.
“We are doing so much. It’s 
really been gratifying, in a 
way, to be a part of something 
that is so comprehensive 
and 
has 
all 
these 
state 
agencies participating in,” 
Wasilevich said. “We need 
to continue to do these kinds 
of investigations and direct 
funding to support it.”

“We want to be very 
thoughtful about what we 
think we can understand,” 
Papsal said. “And we don’t 
want to be insulting to 
anyone (thinking) that we 
could 
truly 
understand 
what those individuals are 
going through, but we can 
talk about it. We can raise 
awareness.”
SAWC Director Dan Kelly 
addressed the crowd as the 
event began. Kelly implored 
attendees to leave the Diag 
with not only a greater 
understanding 
of 
what 
experiencing homelessness 
entails, but also an action 
plan for moving forward.
Student 
leaders 
from 
CURIS and MReach said 
they were eager to turn 
the 
event’s 
momentum 
into 
tangible 
action. 
CURIS 
rebranded 
their 
organization 
this 
year, 
moving away from clinical 
work and into advocacy. 
As a result, Public Health 
senior Josie Lee, president 
of 
CURIS, 
said 
the 
organization was seeking 
out a community partner 
who 
had 
experience 
in the field when their 
communication with SAWC 
began.
“Our 
purpose 
was, 
‘They’re already doing so 
much, they already have the 
connections, but what were 
the gaps? Is there anything 
that we could maybe fill?’” 
Lee said.
Similarly, MReach is a new 
organization this semester. 
MReach President Cameron 
Zurawlow, Business junior, 
said the organization’s goal 
was to foster community 
partnerships such as that 
with SAWC.
“Hopefully 
this 
will 
be a night that CURIS 
and MReach continue to 
do every (year), and that 
was the main purpose of 
this 
year: 
establishing 
those 
relationships 
and 
making a change within 
the community,” Zurawlow 

said.
In 
planning 
for 
next 
year, Papsal noted the need 
to apply for an overnight 
permit further in advance. 
Despite having begun to 
plan for the event just 
as 
students 
returned 
to 
campus 
in 
September, 
Papsal said they did not 
apply 
for 
the 
overnight 
permit with enough notice 
to gain approval. The event, 
which lasted seven hours, 
ended at 2 a.m. rather than 
at daybreak because of this.
Lee also said she hopes 
next year’s turnout will 
be larger. She explained 
how 
in 
her 
four 
years 
at 
the 
University, 
she 
has 
observed 
many 
insensitive 
conversations 
where poverty is clearly 
misunderstood. 
Lee 
said 
this was likely on account 
of the privilege afforded 
to what she believes is 
a majority of University 
students.
“Personally, I feel like 
there’s 
something 
U-M 
students 
particularly 
… 
need to learn more about 
this,” Lee said. “They need 
to be more aware of this 
topic, so hopefully it will 
be a tradition that happens 
every year.”
Lee 
sees 
homelessness 
as 
a 
personal 
topic 
because there was a period 
during which her brother 
experienced homelessness. 
She and Papsal explained 
how quickly and irreversibly 
a person can transition from 
poverty 
to 
homelessness 
through no fault of their 
own.
Lee 
and 
Papsal 
also 
noted the importance of 
preventative measures. In 
Papsal’s experience, it is 
far easier to save someone’s 
housing situation at the last 
second than it is to begin 
anew when they become 
homeless. 
SAWC 
client 
Yolanda 
Neely 
said 
when 
SAWC 
acknowledged her humanity 
as well as her homelessness, 
she was finally able to begin 
the recovery process.
“I say that was the first 

day of the beginning of my 
new life and the last day 
of the end of my old life, 
with me not knowing it,” 
Neely said. “I went there 
angry, upset, thinking my 
life was over, but they gave 
me something that I didn’t 
think that I had. They cared 
for me.”
Neely also expressed a 
need for more preventative 
measures 
against 

homelessness, 
such 
as 
affordable 
housing. 
She 
referenced 
Ann 
Arbor’s 
housing crisis, which Papsal 
blames for SAWC’s inability 
to house virtually any of 
their clients in Ann Arbor 
post-recovery.
The fight for affordable 
housing 
in 
Ann 
Arbor, 
which has been brewing for 
years, persists in Ann Arbor 
among both students and 
residents. Protesters took 
to the street on Sunday in 
order to protest mounting 
difficulties.
Ann Arbor City Council 
discussed the issue Monday, 
approving a proposal to 
begin 
affordable 
housing 
development by a 9-2 vote. 
In regard to the decision, 
Councilmember 
Zachary 
Ackerman, 
D-Ward, 
who 
voted 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
development, 
advised 
listeners that, despite the 
proposal’s 
success, 
any 
tangible changes were likely 
four to five years down the 
road.
In the meantime, Papsal 
urged students who are 
interested 
in 
helping 
to 
donate 
or 
contact 
SAWC 
at 
734-662-2829 
for more information on 
volunteering.
“Our greatest goal would 
be 
that 
people 
would 
want to come to us and 
more meaningful ways to 
volunteer and actually have 
more 
client 
interaction,” 
Papsal said. “Really having 
the greatest minds in the 
community 
(use) 
their 
energy to do more than what 
they’re currently doing.”

Al 
Ahmad 
has 
forged 
connections 
with 
her 
interview subjects, some of 
whom she has grown close 
with over her years of covering 
the area. As she returned to 
Yemen over the years, she 
recognized the effect the 
trauma from the civil war was 
having on people’s perception 
of time and reality.
“Nothing prepares you for 
how you need to handle these 
cases,” Al Ahmad said. “How 
do you maintain distance, 
but also empathy (and) trust? 
They become your friends, 
you talk to them all the time, 
and so the boundaries are 
very difficult to deal with.”
In addition to being a 
journalist, Al Ahmad covers 
her 
stories 
through 
film, 
directing documentaries that 
were broadcast on programs 
like PBS and CBS.
“The 
camera 
is 
an 
interesting addition to a war 
zone, because it enables me to 
filter everything through that 
frame, through that lens,” Al 
Ahmad said. “It actually gives 
me emotional distance.”
Though 
she 
is 
both 
a 
filmmaker and a journalist, 
Al Ahmad said she prioritizes 
the story being told over the 
quality of camera work.
“I’m 
not 
one 
of 
those 
people who’s going to make 
a beautiful film, and I don’t 
really care about that as 
much as, ‘Are you getting the 
information that you need 
from this scene?’” Al Ahmad 
said.
As someone applying for 
the Wallenberg Fellowship 

to learn about the lives 
of 
Yemeni 
refugees 
and 
asylum seekers, LSA senior 
Ayat 
AL-Tamimi 
attended 
Al 
Ahmad’s 
lecture 
for 
the 
opportunity 
to 
learn 
from someone who is doing 
groundwork 
in 
a 
similar 
field.
“I think at the heart of it 
was that she talked about 
all these war and political 
factions, but I don’t think 
any of that mattered in the 
grand scheme of the story,” 
AL-Tamimi 
said. 
“What 
mattered was the human 
element, and people’s lives 
and how those have been 
impacted by people who put 
ideology above human life.” 
LSA junior Jalal Mawri, 
who attended the lecture, is 
a Yemeni-American student 
who lived in Yemen until 2013. 
Mawri said he felt a personal 
connection to Al Ahmad’s 
stories, as two of his cousins 
had been killed in airstrikes 
in Yemen.
“It was brutally emotional,” 
Mawri said. “When I was 
hearing those stories that 
she was saying, I got really 
emotional. I had a few tears 
coming out of my eyes.”
Al 
Ahmad 
became 
emotional 
while 
sharing 
stories of civilian casualties 
she had encountered while on 
the ground in Yemen, ranging 
from a five year old girl who 
died alone standing in line to 
get water, to a mother who 
lost her two boys to a missile 
strike that hit them while 
they were playing outside. 
“If anything, this was a 
reminder that you can have 
five factions warring in a 
village, but in the end, a kid 
is still a kid who answers to 

his mother,” AL-Tamimi said. 
“A faction doesn’t take that 
away.”
Currently, Al Ahmad is 
working on a podcast about 
Saudi Arabian human rights 
in Arabic. She is also looking 
to 
continue 
her 
coverage 
of Yemen in the future by 
revisiting her footage and 
seeing how the understanding 
of the conflict has changed.
“For a lot of people, access 
is more important than the 
story itself,” Al Ahmad said. 
“I hope I never get accused 
of 
just 
being 
someone 
who has access but no real 
journalism.”
At the end of her lecture, 
Al Ahmad was met with a 
standing ovation from the 
audience. This was followed 
by a Q&A section, which 
included 
a 
question 
from 
an audience member about 
being a female reporter in the 
Middle East. 
Al Ahmad responded that 
she sees her gender as being 
a superpower, since she can 
cover Yemeni women with 
sensitivity to their culture 
and situation. Other questions 
addressed Al Ahmad’s opinion 
about other conflicts in the 
Middle East area and the 
relations between the region 
and the United States.
Reflecting on Al Ahmad’s 
speech, 
AL-Tamimi 
was 
moved by her description 
of the Yemeni people being 
impacted by the civil war. 
“I think what really moved 
me to tears when she talked 
about how people being here is 
a sign of people not forgetting 
about Yemen,” AL-Tamimi 
said. “I think people often 
forget that people living in 
the Middle East are people.”

“So, for the ACLU, them 
dealing with the courts was 
particular to that, and then 
we wanted to talk about the 
experience of women too, and 
Banner teaches at a women’s 
prison.”
Fancher began the panel by 
outlining the history of mass 
incarceration in the United 
States and noting points in 
recent American history in 
which Black Americans have 
been wrongly incarcerated.
“During the Civil Rights 
era, people were arrested for 
simply exercising their First 
Amendment rights. … During 
the Black Power movement, 
you’d find people who were 
framed… some of these people 
imprisoned in the 1960s are 
still in prison today,” Fancher 
said. “During the war on 
drugs… the number of people 
who went to prison skyrocketed 
because 
of 
policies 
that 
demonized people… and (law 
enforcement) swept through 
Black communities.”
Before 
continuing, 
both 

Banner and Fancher stressed 
to the audience that the issue 
of mass incarceration is not 
simply a point of partisan 
disagreement.
“The issue is not one between 
Democrats and Republicans, 
but it is between those in power 
and those who are oppressed,” 
Fancher said.
“Sentencing guidelines (for 
the War on Drugs) were voted 
on by both Democrats and 
Republicans,” Banner said.
Both Banner and Fancher 
offered up potential changes in 
policy and general approaches 
to the problems surrounding 
mass incarceration. 
Fancher 
focused 
on 
the 
issue 
of 
policing 
and 
the 
disproportionate 
impact 
felt in communities of color, 
especially 
Black 
Americans. 
One possible solution to this, 
Fancher said, is to incentivize 
police 
officers 
by 
tying 
promotion and job progression 
to policing in a manner that 
is as unbiased and as fair as 
possible.
“The one thing that I am 
convinced of after talking to, at 
this point, hundreds of police 
officers, is that if they’re not 
concerned 
about 
anything 

else, they’re concerned about 
their careers and their career 
advancement,” Fancher said. 
“If the message somehow gets 
through to them that the way to 
advance is to act as progressive 
as possible… I think that they 
would do it.”
Banner briefly spoke about 
the issues women face in the 
criminal justice system, and the 
rising number of incarcerated 
women.
“From the 1970s to 2000, the 
number of women incarcerated 
grew by 823 percent … and 
women’s 
incarceration 
numbers seem to be growing. 
… So, we need to realize that 
policies are not equal in their 
impact (to men and women),” 
Banner said.
When asked how University 
students interested in helping 
to reduce mass incarceration 
might do so, Fancher offered a 
rather simple solution.
“The reality is, anything I 
do, you can do right now. It just 
becomes a question of whether 
your way of thinking is one that 
just drives you to get up and do 
it,” Fancher said. “You’ve got 
more power, you’ve got more 
influence than you think.”

Populism’s popularity

Information leads to tolerance

W

hat started as a custody 
battle in Texas over 
seven-year-old 
twins 
has transformed into a cultural 
debate 
that 
underscores 
the 
damaging effects of intolerance and 
misinformation about health care for 
transgender people.
The custody battle between 
Jeffrey 
Younger 
and 
Anne 
Georgulas made national headlines 
in late October due to the couple’s 
disagreement 
over 
the 
gender 
identity of their child. One of their 
twins, who chooses to go by Luna, 
was assigned male at birth but 
identifies as female. Luna first began 
expressing a desire to be a girl at 
around age three. Since then, her 
mother has taken Luna to doctors 
who have recommended certain 
gender-affirming actions, such as 
allowing Luna to dress as a girl and 
identify as a girl in public. These 
so-called gender-affirming actions 
follow the American Academy of 
Pediatrics’ guidelines on how best to 
support children like Luna.
Luna’s father, however, refused to 
follow these recommended steps and 
would not recognize his daughter 
as a girl. He continued to use male 
pronouns for the child, called Luna 
by her birth name and refused to 
allow her to dress in female clothes. 
As he and his wife entered into a 
custody case, Younger also began 
publicizing the court battles, using a 
website created to raise donations for 
himself. He claimed that Georgulas 
was forcing Luna to identify as a girl 
and was going to push a medical sex 
change on Luna. Younger also used 
his website and subsequent media 
coverage for personal monetary 
gain. He is said to have made over 
$139,000 as a result of his actions.
It did not take long for right-

wing media to pick up on this story 
and add further false information, 
including claiming that Georgulas 
was going to “chemically castrate” 
Luna. Soon, the case became fodder 
for conservative politicians. Sen. Ted 
Cruz, R-Texas, claimed Luna was 
being used as a “pawn in a left-wing 
political agenda,” and Gov. Greg 
Abbott, R-Texas, said he had referred 
the case to the Texas Department of 
Family Services.

These comments by politicians 
only serve to misinform people 
about transgender health care. 
For young children such as Luna, 
it is recommended to use gender-
affirming actions such as allowing 
them to choose a new name, choose 
their pronouns and wear what they 
want. If children continue to identify 
with the gender they choose, they 
can begin undergoing treatment 
to block the onset of puberty in 
early adolescence. These hormonal 
treatments are reversible. Only 
later are the decisions made about 
undergoing surgeries.
On Oct. 24, Judge Kim Cooks 
decided to award the couple joint 
custody 
without 
compelling 
Younger to recognize Luna as a 
female. This unfortunate ruling 
will undoubtedly have a negative 

effect on Luna. 
Upon reading about this court 
case, I brought it up in conversation 
and was shocked to find many 
people whom I interact with in 
my daily life incorrectly believed 
that young children would receive 
irreversible medical treatments 
to change their gender. Most of 
these individuals are very tolerant 
of the LGBTQ community but are 
unfamiliar with the process of 
how gender affirmation works in 
regards to young children. 
For these people, it was simply a 
lack of information or even worse, 
the spread of misinformation. One 
of the most shocking things about 
this whole story is the role of fake 
news and hyperbole. Not only 
were websites pushing Younger’s 
claims, but so were elected officials 
such as governors and members of 
Congress. These are people who 
at face value we believe we can 
trust, but in reality, we cannot. 
Though it may be tedious, it is more 
important than ever for us to be 
cautious and to question the media 
we consume. We will all be better 
off if we read critically and ensure 
that what we are reading is actually 
rooted in fact.
If people ensured they read 
credible articles on this case, 
they would likely be able to find 
out about the benefits of gender-
affirming actions and would, 
therefore, be more accepting of 
parents and children who are 
using these actions. If we want 
to build a more tolerant and 
accepting world for children like 
Luna, it is up to all of us to embrace 
information that is based in truth.

O

ne hundred and ninety-
five 
years 
ago, 
the 
Democratic-Republican 
Party 
tapped 
a 
hot-tempered 
Tennessean 
nicknamed 
“Old 
Hickory” to headline 
its 
presidential 
ticket. 
Andrew 
Johnson, the hero 
of 
the 
Battle 
of 
New Orleans — an 
entirely 
self-made 
man who grew up 
impoverished 
and 
orphaned in the Waxhaws 
region 
of 
South 
Carolina 
region of the Carolinas — 
received more than 45,000 
more popular votes and 15 
more 
electoral 
votes 
than 
his 
nearest 
competitor, 
National 
Republican 
John 
Quincy Adams, but fell short 
of the electoral vote majority 
necessary to secure the Oval 
Office. In accordance with 
the 
Twelfth 
Amendment, 
the election was therefore 
to be decided by the House 
of Representatives. Through 
congressional maneuvering — 
nefarious or adroit, depending 
on perspective — Adams, the 
son of Founding Father John 
Adams, won the House vote in 
February 1825. 
Supporters felt that Jackson, 
who had received a clear 
plurality, had been snubbed by 
Adams and his congressional 
allies. Four years later, the 
1828 election featured a second 
showdown between Jackson 
and the incumbent Adams, 
offering an opportunity to 
rectify the outcome of 1824. 
Much of Jackson’s base, rooted 
in the rural South and western 
frontier, 
disdained 
Adams 
as a pampered New England 
aristocrat. In Jackson, a man 
of the humblest origins, they 
had found a champion and 
protector 
of 
the 
common 
man against the blue-blooded 
Washington 
establishment. 
The 
populist’s 
resounding 
victory, therefore, was the 
first electoral triumph of the 
everyday American against the 
elite class to which the first six 
occupants of the White House 
belonged.
The 
electoral 
outcome, 
Jackson 
beamed, 
was 
a 
“triumph 
of 
the 
great 
principle of self-government 
over 
the 
intrigues 
of 
aristocracy.” The forgotten 
man, engaged in a perpetual 
struggle 
for 
recognition 
in a world dominated by 
elite interests, now had a 
champion at the highest seat 

in American government. 
Like an ocean tide that 
advances and recedes, the 
resurgence 
of 
a 
populist 
animus 
against “the elites” 
to the forefront of 
American politics is 
inevitable. The 2016 
election 
witnessed 
a rebirth of this 
perennial struggle. 
With the clinching 
of 
Wisconsin’s 
10 
electoral 
votes, 
Donald 
Trump 
became 
president-elect 
at 
2:30 a.m. November 9, 2016. 
An hour later, the brash New 
Yorker took to Twitter and 
acknowledged 
the 
populist 
wave that carried him to 
victory. “The forgotten man 
and woman,” Trump promised, 
“will never be forgotten again.”
The national populism that 
came to define Trump’s brand 
resonated 
with 
Americans 
who, like Jackson’s supporters, 
felt 
disaffected 
and 
disconnected with the world 
around them. Hillary Clinton, 
cast by her opponent as a self-
serving elitist, was an iteration 
of 
John 
Quincy 
Adams; 
Trump, an energetic disrupter, 
promised due consideration 
of the common man. In what 
was 
evidently 
perceived 
as a bold stand against the 
establishment 
machine, 
Trump framed himself as the 
brusque Jacksonian champion 
of blue-jeans America. 
Feelings of alienation — 
legitimacy aside — is what 
makes populist rhetoric so 
attractive. 
The 
fact 
that 
right-wing 
dimensions 
of 
populism have surged in the 
United States in recent years 
is no accident, because it was 
conservative populations who 
felt alienated in the lead up to 
the 2016 election. 
Take 
immigration, 
a 
spotlight issue in the last 
election 
cycle. 
Trump’s 
antipathies 
toward 
illegal 
immigrants were a rhetorical 
centerpiece of his presidential 
campaign; 
he 
has 
even 
since 
characterized 
illegal 
immigration as an “invasion” 
that has “violently overrun” 
America’s 
southern 
border. 
In promising a border wall, 
Trump seemed to reassure 
Americans 
that 
under 
his 
administration, 
unwelcome 
outsiders would not overtake 
Americans 
in 
their 
own 
country.
The 
populist, 
anti-
establishment 
character 
of 
Trump’s 
campaign 
rhetoric 

is evident in these statements 
too. “The fundamental problem 
with the immigration system 
in our country,” Trump said 
at an August 2016 campaign 
rally in Arizona, “is that it 
serves the needs of wealthy 
donors, 
political 
activists 
and powerful politicians. Let 
me tell you who it doesn’t 
serve: it doesn’t serve you, the 
American people.”
Conservatives, 
however, 
by no means have a corner on 
populism. A political narrative 
that juxtaposes the “common 
man” with the “elite,” the 
cornerstone of all populist 
ideologies, has found refuge 
in left-leaning rhetoric, too. 
While conservative populism 
has devoted much of its energy 
to immigration, Sen. Bernie 
Sanders, I-Vt. — the left’s most 
prominent 
populist 
— 
has 
railed against big business, 
corporate interests and the top 
one percent.
The progressive emphasis 
on tackling inequality has 
found increasing support: 29 
percent of Democrats were 
self-described “progressives” 
in 2016, a figure that rocketed 
to 44 percent by last year’s 
midterms. While none of the 
presidential candidates are as 
left-wing as Sanders, several of 
the presidential hopefuls have 
championed populist policies, 
such as sweeping health care 
reform and antitrust measures.
What has become clear from 
all this is that populism is in 
fashion because the theme 
of the common man against 
the elites is resonating with 
Americans 
of 
all 
political 
stripes. Four years ago, a 
New York developer observed 
this reality, built a campaign 
around it and took the White 
House 
through 
a 
populist 
wave. 
Three of the most important 
states in the 2020 election 
are 
Michigan, 
Wisconsin 
and 
Ohio, 
which 
together 
command 
a 
potentially 
decisive 44 electoral votes. 
With their Midwestern, old-
school idealism, voters in these 
states could very well buy into 
a liberal brand of populism. 
While 
most 
Democratic 
candidates fare well in head-
to-head 
polling 
against 
Trump, they would still do 
well to consider why Trump 
was able to turn these states 
red in 2016 — a question whose 
answer is rooted, of course, in 
populism’s popularity.

Building on CAPS

A

s the winter months quickly approach, many University 
students may begin to feel their moods darken as the weather 
gets drearier and schoolwork becomes more intense. During 
such times, mental health support services are in high demand.

For 
many 
students, 
the first line of defense 
against 
mental 
health 
struggles is the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
Counseling 
and Psychological Services. 
However, as wait times for 
appointments reach upward 
of two weeks, it is clear 
CAPS may not be accessible 
to 
all 
students 
seeking 
assistance. 
Many University students 
frequently criticize CAPS 
as 
ineffective, 
largely 
because of the long wait 
times. 
Services 
such 
as 
CAPS are deeply important 
to the University, and we 
encourage all students to 
seriously seek help if they 
need it. However, as students 
at the University, we feel 
there are fundamental and 
structural 
changes 
that 
CAPS must make in order to 
ensure that students are able 
to obtain the proper care. 
For many students, the 
actual 
purpose 
of 
CAPS 
is unclear. They do not 
prescribe medications for 
mental illness, but rather 
serve 
as 
a 
resource 
for 
short-term talk therapy and 
can act as a pipeline to other 
services on campus. They 
mainly act as a treatment 
center 
for 
acute 
issues 
and 
not 
for 
long-term, 
specialized care. However, 
the often prohibitively-long 
wait times do not reflect 
this 
aspect 
of 
providing 
care for short-term issues. 
Additionally, 
for 
many 
students on campus who 
may not have diagnosable 
mental 
disorders 
but 
regardless 
struggle 
with 
the 
demands 
of 
college 
life, talk therapy should 
certainly be prioritized over 
other 
treatment 
options 
such 
as 
medication. 
For 
this reason, they are an 
excellent resource for many 
University students. Yet the 
inability of CAPS to meet 
with students over a longer 
period of time is a hindrance 
to such individuals. The 
fact that they are unable to 
provide for such services 
with its current budget is 
understandable. 
However, 
CAPS should serve as a 
pipeline to other options 
for students in need of 

longer-term care. This can 
include services such as 
local 
therapists 
holding 
“office 
hours” 
to 
speak 
with students in need a 
few times a week, referrals 
to therapists in Michigan 
Medicine 
and 
access 
to 
professional 
therapists 
covered 
by 
insurance 
or 
with need-based aid. 
With that in mind, it would 
be helpful to students if 
CAPS took action to amplify 
their outreach and expand 
their 
resources. 
Certain 
steps 
have 
been 
taken, 
including 
North 
Campus 
recently opening their own 
Wellness Zone, but there 
needs to be more available 
to students living on North 
beyond the sun lamps in 
this space. CAPS has also 
taken steps to create school-
specific 
therapists 
for 
students on North Campus 
and beyond. This includes 
the 
implementation 
of 
“embedded” 
psychologists 
and social workers: At least 
one specialized and full-
time 
counselor 
in 
each 
University school, including 
those on North Campus. 
CAPS now even has two 
counselors 
conveniently 
available for all students in 
the College of Engineering. 
While these school-specific 
counselors 
do 
help 
to 
increase 
the 
therapist-
student ratio, there are more 
areas that need funding and 
resources.
While we acknowledge the 
work of CAPS with school-
specific 
therapists 
and 
counselors for non-binary 
and trans individuals, CAPS 
should continue to expand 
resources so more students 
are 
more 
comfortable 
readily 
accessing 
them. 
Implementation 
of 
the 
CAPS Trans Care Team, 
a group of mental health 
care providers specifically 
trained 
in 
providing 
affirming 
care 
to 
trans 
and 
non-binary 
students, 
is a great step in the right 
direction. 
Unfortunately, 
long wait times and limited 
professional resources can 
still compel students feel as 
if they cannot or should not 
seek adequate help. After 
all, knowing that there is 

scarce availability can make 
students hesitant to take 
those resources away from 
a fellow student who might 
“need it more.”
We 
acknowledge 
that 
CAPS on their own cannot 
simply 
revolutionize 
the 
current plan and implement 
new, radical programs. For 
that reason, the University 
should consider allocating 
more 
funding 
to 
CAPS 
so new ideas can be seen 
through and more staff can 
be hired. U-M’s budget for 
Counseling 
Services 
this 
year is nearly $3 million, 
a 
nearly 
$800,000-dollar 
decrease from that of the 
previous year. The University 
does not seem to have a 
lack of disposable income 
— 
the 
Michigan 
Union 
renovation, just one of many 
major campus construction 
projects, had a budget of 
$85.2 million. A new medical 
building is purported to cost 
U-M more than $900 million. 
It 
seems 
deeply 
illogical 
to cut funding to CAPS. 
There is an outstanding and 
chronic issue with mental 
health among students on 
campus, and U-M should 
recognize 
and 
respond 
to this demand for more 
mental health resources. It 
is arguably more important 
to have healthy, happy and 
treated students than a new, 
shiny building.
CAPS does a lot for our 
campus, 
but 
they 
could 
do a lot more and reach 
a 
much 
broader 
range 
of 
students 
if 
increased 
funding was poured into 
the program. While we do 
not want to negate the help 
they currently provide for 
thousands of students, we 
do challenge that this help 
is 
often 
temporary, 
and 
resources 
for 
long-term 
care often fall short. With 
the winter season steadily 
approaching, and as daylight 
continues 
to 
decline, 
we 
encourage better and more 
expansive 
mental 
health 
options and programming 
for students on campus.

Social media and what we think of as DIY culture today are 
incredibly interconnected. Shows are organized on Facebook, 
with attendance being estimated based on the number of “goings” 
and “maybes,” videos of bands performing are publicized 
through Instagram stories. Even Twitter plays a part in allowing 
bands to personally connect with fans via memes and rants. As 
society progresses further and further into the digital age, DIY 
stands as a prime example of social media’s influence on our 
communities.
However, sometimes I wish this weren’t the case. In an 
ongoing effort to limit my social media usage, I’m constantly 
held back by the thought that if I’m not constantly online, I’ll 
lose touch with my local community. If I delete my Facebook, 
how will I ever know when there’s a show going on? Or if I don’t 
check my Twitter, how am I supposed to stay informed about 
which independent labels I should or should not support? 
Of course, word of mouth is still a viable way to hear about 
shows and events in the community, and every once in a while 
posters for shows emerge around campus (groups like MEMCO 
do a great job of this). But I feel like these two tactics have taken 
a much more subservient roll to the internet. In 2019, I feel as if 
DIY promotion is mostly contained within screens. These events 
were probably talked about in-person much more extensively 
in the past, and flyering was probably a much more important 
promotional tactic a few years ago, but now it almost feels like a 
novelty of sorts. 
Part of the appeal of local music and DIY is the community that 
it fosters, and the relationships it builds between people through 
art. It’s entirely possible to build and maintain a community 
through social media, but I think to really build a strong 
community, connecting with people face-to-face is something 
that cannot be undervalued, especially in environments outside 
of shows. Seeing the community in person outside of venues is 
something that seems to have come to a halt. It seems as if DIY 
only exists on the Internet and in basements for a few nights 
every month. 
Some artists, like Philadelphia-based Absinthe Father, have 
an incredibly strong presence on social media, and attract fans 
(like me, for instance) that have never been to one of their shows 
in person. Their tweets regularly go viral, and attract new fans 
to their music daily. On the opposite end of the spectrum, groups 
like Hotline TNT, a band that I discovered through a car ride 
with a friend, merely have a YouTube channel that they upload 
their music on, with no other social media. I have no idea how 
long the band has been around, who’s in the group, or where 
they’re from, but I know that I really like their music. The band’s 
lack of an online presence is something of a rarity among bands 
nowadays, and almost seems like a factor that’s restricted them 
from growing, unfortunately. It seems much harder to succeed 
without some sort of online presence. 
I’m definitely coming off as a grouchy old man here. I really 
do think the Internet has exposed a completely new audience to 
DIY, and has even made it more accessible to certain groups of 
people that may not have heard about these shows and events 
before. But I think there’s a bit of an imbalance between the 
online and offline community. Tell someone you don’t know as 
well about a show coming up, or maybe talk to your local record 
store about having a bulletin board of local events and shows. 
I’m not saying that everyone should hang up and hang out, but 
I do think that there’s something special about expanding the 
community outside of the Internet.

DIY COLUMN

Despite a tendency to allow songs and albums to demarcate 
periods in my life, I’ve found that Waxahatchee’s fourth 
album evades this contract. Any such associations I might 
filter through the 10-track album — a person, a relationship, 
an emotional season — are absent. I’ve come to believe that 
this is because Out in the Storm, uniquely and brilliantly, 
evades a sole moment. The relationship that songwriter Katie 
Crutchfield surveys is one available only at a distant retrospect 
— that is, once one has stepped far, far back from the ring of a 
relationship and can trace the life cycle of their love 
carefully, almost scientifically. Falling in love with 
Crutchfield’s album means falling in love with her 
audit of infatuation from start to finish. Out in the 
Storm throws punches at early love and laps at the 
feet of breakups; it screams with hatred and stomps 
out a rhythm to insecurity. It’s a broad and timeless 
narrative, one which, rather than pairing with a sole 
person or emotion, I appreciate for its amalgamation 
of so many emotions that seem both greatly distant 
and staggeringly familiar.
***
Hovering over a sudden outbreak of violent electric 
guitar, Katie Crutchfield of Waxahatchee opens her 
fourth album, Out in the Storm, with a taste of both 
sloppy adoration and fear in her mouth. There’s an 
air of determination and aggression to the track: 
“I spend all my time learning how to defeat / you 
at your own game, it’s embarrassing,” Crutchfield 
sings in “Never Been Wrong.” “I love being right, 
especially with you.” It’s Crutchfield’s confident 
acknowledgement of a thrilling roulette game of love, 
one where she’s at her partner’s mercy but is up for 
the fight. It’s comparable to Sia’s “Fair Game,” in 
which the Australian singer likens her relationships 
to a game, one where she wants the tables, for once, 
to be leveled. Waxahatchee, on the other hand, seems 
OK with the presence of disparity. “I saw you as a big 
fish / I saw you as a conquest,” she later confesses. Unlike Sia’s 
sorrowful longing, Crutchfield’s thrilled acceptance of these 
conditions on her opening track raises the stakes for the rest of 
the album. And we’re eager with her, anticipating what turmoil 
will transpire.
What separates the track from Sia’s cry for a fair game, too, 
is the fear that “Never Been Wrong” also drizzles over its harsh 
instrumentals: “Everyone / will hear me complain / Everyone 
/ will pity my name.” Beneath the gritty willingness to crouch 
down over the board and move a pawn, there’s a moment of 
hesitation. It’s subtle, but it’s there.
The rest of Out in the Storm, as it turns out, pans out a high-speed 
synopsis of the game Crutchfield lays bare in her opening track. 

In “Sparks Fly” she’s in the thick of love; in “Brass Beam” she’s 
fighting back against her partner’s narcissism and unsteadiness. 
“8 Ball” confesses toxicity and “No Question” chronicles anger 
so fervently that it’s as if you’re a lover, a thrown champagne 
glass having just missed your head. The album becomes a 
roadmap of a relationship with distinct checkpoints. At the same 
time, these points in the narrative don’t feel locked into their 
respective slots on the tracklist — at times, Crutchfield’s writing 
feels true and nonspecific enough that these checkpoints could 
be rearranged to puzzle together a new relationship.
A softened punk sound pervades Out in the Storm, a noise 
distinct from both the band’s lo-fi precedent and piano-ballad 
follow-up album. It’s as if Bikini Kill were dampened or, heading 

the opposite direction, if Sharon Van Etten’s vocals were torn 
up and pasted back together. Each track centers on an organic 
thrash of drums that amplifies Waxahatchee, even when things 
feel sobering and despondent. With it, there’s an overpowering 
electric guitar. The album has another noticeable consistency, 
though, and one that goes almost unnoticed without tender 
listening: Just about every line is insulated with a harmony from 
Crutchfield’s sister, cut and laid over the original vocals. It’s not 
just for emphasis; it is, literally, nearly every line. The padding 
of these harmonies softens the punkish aura of the album. It 
renders it aggressive but never overwhelming. Where the album 
already seems cohesive lyrically, such tactical blankets link 
Crutchfield’s confessions together musically, too.

The album reaches its creative and lyrical summit with 
“Sparks Fly,” a track in which Crutchfield watches herself fall in 
love through her sister’s eyes. Like a practiced poet, Crutchfield 
trusts her audience. The terms she offers are never specific 
or explained; she knows we’ll mold the rest of the narrative 
for ourselves.“Sparks fly / sparks fly,” she repeats throatily 
throughout the song. “I’m raw like wire / electrified.” It’s a 
deliriously genius track that admits the indelible hunger that love 
calls forth. Perhaps the most striking line of the album is a simple 
but heavy concession: “I’m a live wire / finally.” There is a gush 
to the lyric, and though Crutchfield sings it in an even register, 
one might sense a shake hidden behind her voice on “finally” — 
instrumentals pause for the briefest moment. It’s a tone monitored 
carefully to prevent thrill from leaking through. It’s a 
descent into infatuation: finally, wonderfully.
Bits like “Sparks Fly” showcase, too, the album’s 
truth-through-storytelling practice, a feat like that 
accomplished in the narratives that percolate Big 
Thief’s 2016 Masterpiece. Songs lay out unassuming 
landscapes and actions that, though briefly mentioned, 
make the album’s experiences both personal and 
accessible. “We sat in the hot summer twilight / radio 
loud and the brim bite / the Coosa water is choppy and 
wild / I jumped abruptly, unreconciled.” Crutchfield 
similarly understands the capacity of small, tangible 
things — the way light falls in a stranger’s bedroom, 
say — to represent something bulky and unwieldy. 
She capitalizes on this. These objects and details are 
in the periphery, perhaps insignificant, long before 
they are injected into the song. Crutchfield’s strength 
is fishing them from these spaces and noticing the 
power they can possess in recalling a long-buried 
intimacy.
“Fade,” the album’s conclusion, serves as a delicate 
outro. The intensity of prior tracks is pulled out from 
under Crutchfield, who sings flatly over acoustic 
strums. “You wring me out / I tell the truth,” she 
sings. “I kissed you goodbye / and hid for the rest of 
your life.” It’s a track that feels like closing a book, 
just-finished, slowly. It’s the exit from the storm. It 
should be despairing, and Crutchfield’s harmonies, 
spread across the song thin like butter, make it sound so. But 
there is a sense of acceptance, a breathy hope peeking through 
the nostalgia. “I first saw you through childish eyes / I was in 
love with a song,” the lyrics admit — though not necessarily in 
defeat. Rather, for the conclusion, she distances herself from the 
relationship: “I stayed out of your way.” The guitar strums fall 
into a rhythm and slow. The game ended, Waxahatchee tells us, 
and guitar reverberations overtake the track. But there is a sense, 
having lingered with Crutchfield through the surefire center of 
her album, that there will be another round. Another player, 
surely, will enter the arena. Until then, there is little choice but 
to revel in the searing, expansive chronicle of the game already 
played.

“Charlie’s Angels,” directed by Elizabeth Banks (“Pitch 
Perfect 2”), is a movie meant for all the women who have ever 
had a condescending man talk down to them, for all the women in 
male-dominated fields who have to deal with misogynists every 
day. It’s meant for all the women who have had to sit through 
countless male-driven films in the past, forced to be appeased 
by the presence of a single 
female who serves as a 
vehicle for “equality.” It’s 
for all the women who have 
been told to “smile” and 
“look pretty” and who have 
been called “good girls” by 
men who don’t know them 
or care to know them. It’s 
for women who need to be 
empowered.
This film takes all the 
best parts of the previous 
renditions 
of 
“Charlie’s 
Angels” and incorporates 
all 
the 
feminist 
ideals 
present in modern day 
society, so you’re left with 
an action-packed, intense but shockingly real movie that makes 
you feel.
One thing that makes this movie so interesting to watch is 
the thread of inverting common media tropes. There is a minor 
love story, sure, but it’s not the primary plot. It’s not even the 
secondary plot. Noah 
Centineo (“To All the 
Boys I’ve Loved Before”) 
plays Langston, one of 
Elena’s colleagues, and 
has an almost laughably 
small role. In fact, he 
takes the role of the 
damsel in distress and 
is, in essence, the token 
male. It’s about time we 
had a movie where there 
were hardly any men, 
and the few guys who 
are present are either 
hilariously incompetent, 
like Alexander Brock 
(Sam Claflin, “Me Before 
You”), or reduced to 
minor love interests like 
Centineo.
The three leads of 
the film all take on a 
different strength found 
in women and a different 
“flaw” typically attributed to them. Then, they cleverly invert 
the stereotype forced upon them. There’s quirky and chaotic 
heiress-turned-convict-turned-Angel Sabina (Kristen Stewart, 
“Twilight”) who is confident but self-centered. Then you have 
Jane (Ella Balinska, “Juction 9”), a fearless and fierce former MI6 
agent who was let down by her agency one too many times and 
lost hope and trust in people, leaving her seemingly emotionless 

and guarded. And finally, exceedingly bright but soft-spoken 
Elena, a scientist — and newbie to the Angel world — who lets 
her sexist superiors patronize and push her around (Naomi 
Scott, “Aladdin”). By the end of the movie, the characters make 
something more out of their so-called flaws. Forever-confident 
Sabina finds a reason to care about other people, Jane lets herself 
be vulnerable and open up to people while maintaining the 
fierceness that defines her character, and Elena stands up for 
herself and shows off the intelligence she’s always known she has.
The movie doesn’t shy away from letting the women be 
women. They’re not just 
agents 
who 
fight 
crime 
while looking good — they 
have real emotions. One 
of the most meaningful 
scenes in the film finds the 
three leads on a quiet boat 
following an intense fight. 
They’re sitting together, all 
half-asleep on one another, 
just enjoying each other’s 
presence. What makes the 
moment especially tender is 
the presence of a little girl. 
She 
interacts 
seamlessly 
with the Angels, all of whom 
talk to her and play with her. 
While these women might 
be machines when it comes to taking down bad guys, they’re not 
robots.
Even though that scene is one of my favorite moments from 
the whole film, it’s not the best part of the movie. It’s not Sabina’s 
humor or Jane’s epic fight scenes or even Elena’s opportunity 
to stand up for herself, 
either. The best part of 
the movie, as cliche as 
it might sound, is the 
message it leaves for 
all the women in the 
audience. There is no 
one perfect model of 
a woman. Anyone can 
be an Angel. Whether 
you’re a little weird, 
physically 
strong 
or 
intimidatingly 
intelligent, you have the 
makings of an Angel. 
Previous “female team-
up” movies try to get 
the 
same 
message 
across, but I’ve always 
found that the women 
favored in those films 
are the scarily strong 
and physically fit ones. 
That’s not the case in 
“Charlie’s Angels.” Here, 
you’ll find yourself loving and relating to various aspects of the 
incredibly different — but equally inspiring — women on screen. 
While “Charlie’s Angels” can and should be enjoyed by 
everyone — men and women alike — it is, first and foremost, 
a movie meant to empower women. This movie strengthens 
women’s beliefs in themselves and gives them the opportunity to 
find what makes them Angels.

‘Angels’ showcases strong women

Showrunner John Wells miscalculated the 
direction “Shameless” should go in the post-
Fiona era.
If the Season 10 premiere is any indication, the 
problems with the show have only been further 
magnified. “Shameless” is a show that revolves 
around multiple central characters, so when it 
was announced that Fiona Gallagher (Emmy 
Rossum, “Cold Pursuit”) would be written off 
the show this season, the news was upsetting, 
but did not completely ruin my expectations of 
what was to come. However, it was the quality of 
the storylines themselves, rather than Rossum’s 
absence, that has decreased the critical acclaim 
that came early on in the show’s run. With 
nine seasons and 110 episodes of character 
development to work with, it baffles me how 
much content Wells chooses to ignore. By picking 
and choosing which events from prior seasons 
to engage in, Wells effectively erases what 
happened. 
This is not a new development: Numerous 
storylines have been introduced, only to be 
sidelined with no explanation. Despite all of this, 
dedicated fans, like myself, who have watched the 
show for years still find reasons to be optimistic, 
yet 
critical. 
Next 
week 
will 
reintroduce 
“Gallavich” — the relationship between Ian 
Gallagher (Cameron Monaghan, “Gotham”) and 
Mickey Milkovich (Noel Fisher, “The Red Line”) 
— to the narrative. When a new season starts, 
the first episode is supposed to set the tone to 
give viewers a preview of what this season will 
be about. This leaves viewers wondering why 
“Gallavich” was not explored in the premiere, 
with the rest of the storylines being stale and not 
worthy of including in a premiere.
Somehow, the writers made Debbie (Emma 
Kenney, “The Connors”) less likable. The 18-year-
old has now assumed the authorities previously 
held by the former family matriarch Fiona. Part 
of this is managing the $50,000 check Fiona left 
the family. But, in typical Debbie fashion, she is 
secretly buying and returning fancy clothes that 
she keeps in a storage locker, in order to pick up 
women at hotel bars instead of saving for a rainy 
day. If you need more evidence for why Debbie is 
the worst, when she does this, she tells her family 
that she is completing job training and leaves her 

daughter next door. On another note, Debbie is 
certainly not 21 and does not look it — there is 
no way a fancy hotel would serve someone who 
looks as young as her.
Two of the most misused characters on 
“Shameless” are Kevin Ball (Steve Howey, “Dead 
to Me”) and Veronica Fisher (Shanola Hampton, 
“Three’s Complicated”). Last season, their young 
identical twins were enrolled as one student 
at a private school and this plotline was largely 
ignored until it was convenient for the show. This 
latest installment features Kevin being insecure 
about his age due to his miscalculated belief that 
there is some correlation between his sneakers 
and his basketball ability, a convenient excuse 
to get him back to the place where he spent a 
lot of last season: a gay strip club (because of 
the better tips, even though he is straight). This 
development was uninteresting, as Kevin being 
bad at basketball didn’t come as a surprise to me 
nor has it ever been brought up before so there 
was little reason to care about how it would 
play out. Veronica is being utilized to help the 
youngest Gallagher, Liam (Christian Isaiah, 
“21 Bridges”), discover more about his African-
American identity. Where this plotline falls 
short is that Liam has spent much of the previous 
season exploring his racial identity with his 
friends, raising a simple question — why didn’t 
this happen sooner?
Frank Gallagher (William H. Macy, “Krystal”), 
the alcoholic patriarch of the Gallagher clan, is 
engaged in his usual scams that will amount 
to nothing. Carl Gallagher (Ethan Cutkosky) 
graduated from military school and had an 
absurd amount of sex with his girlfriend. Oh 
yeah, I almost forgot — Lip (Jeremy Allen 
White, “Homecoming”) is now a dad and his 
girlfriend Tami (Kate Miner, “Deviant Love”) is 
in emergency surgery and we’re left wondering 
if she will survive ... even though she appears 
alive and well in the promotional images for the 
season.
The only reason I’m not classifying this 
season of “Shameless” as a failure is because 
the problems I have with the premiere are no 
different than those I had with past seasons. The 
reason “Shameless” continues to be renewed, 
in my eyes, is because of the potential that still 
exists. Even a decade later, there are still so many 
stories to be told with characters we have grown 
to love. But until Wells realizes this potential, 
“Shameless” may continue to be aimless.

‘Shameless’ is bad right now

Season 10 Premiere

Showtime

Sundays @ 9 p.m.

Believers Never Die (Volume Two), the band’s 
second greatest hits collection, is a more promising 
place than their first. Believers Never Die (Volume 
One) mostly consisted of emo singles, allowing the 
band to compile the songs that broke them into the 
popular music scene in the first place. However, 
its release came just before the band’s unfortunate 
announcement of their 2009 hiatus where it later 
became clear that the band’s rapid success was 
quickly turning into something toxic for all four 
band members. After their four year breather, the 
band broke the silence with their 2013 release of “My 
Songs Know What You Did in The Dark,” serving 
as a gateway to a new era for the band, coined “Fall 
Out Boy 2.0.” It’s within this six-year period that 
Believers Never Die (Volume Two) finds its basis, 
covering their best songs from their albums Save 
Rock and Roll (2013), American Beauty / American 
Psycho (2015) and MANIA (2018). 
The album runs through their greatest hits in 
chronological order, fittingly starting with “My 
Songs 
Know 
What You Did in 
The Dark” before 
transitioning into 
the 
symphony 
theatrics 
and 
gritty 
vocals 
of 
“The 
Phoenix” 
and the energetic 
beats 
of 
“Alone 
Together,” 
also 
off of Save Rock 
and 
Roll. 
From 
here, songs and 
their ideas become 
larger and farther-
reaching 
with 
the 
introduction 
of 
“Centuries,” 
a 
high-energy 
tune featuring the passionate, powerful vocal 
performance from Patrick Stump as he belts 
“You will remember me for centuries!” Also 
off of American Beauty / American Psycho is 
“Immortals,” a song with a taste of Asian- styled 
electronics written for Disney’s Big Hero 6, as well 
as “Uma Thurman,” which samples from the “The 
Munsters” theme song.
The final half of the album borrows from their 
most experimental album, MANIA, and “The Last 
of the Real Ones” exemplifies the band’s attempt 
for a fresher sound. While the tune maintains 
the band’s signature vocal spunk, it deviates from 
their rock and roll style with its electronic motifs 
and heightened production approach to smooth 

out some of the band’s rougher edges. “I’ve Been 
Waiting” pushes these boundaries even further 
with its crisp beats and collaboration with Lil Peep 
and iLoveMakonnen. 
What makes this album stand out among the 
greatest hits collections is that the band finishes 
the album with two previously unreleased songs, 
“Dear Future Self” 
and “Bob Dylan.” 
The 
former 
features 
Wyclef 
Jean 
and 
runs 
through 
bouncy 
pop 
loops 
with 
subtle 
electronic 
pulses lingering in 
the 
background. 
The latter ties up 
the album nicely 
with 
winding 
digital 
melodies 
and 
emotional, 
love-stricken 
lyrics that draw 
parallels between 
the love one feels 
for their significant 
other and the love they feel for music’s most well-
respected artists: “Cause everyone loves Bob Dylan 
/ I just want you to love me like that, yeah / Would 
you bury me next to Johnny Cash?” 
While Believers Never Die (Volume Two) 
demonstrates the distance the band has maintained 
from its emo roots, the most notable aspect of 
the album is its emphasis on how much the band 
has progressed since it first started. Despite their 
lengthy hiatus, the band has proven its ability 
to learn from their mistakes and keep running 
with music that works well for them. Fall Out Boy 
continues to fearlessly pursue the very best versions 
of themselves, and this hopeful attitude is what will 
make them “remembered for centuries.”

“Dance has been a really special thing to 
help me build my confidence, both in my voice 
physically and vocally,” said School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance senior Sally Butin. 
Though Butin doesn’t speak in her pieces, 
she has found her voice through dance. Over 
the years, Butin has been inspired by her peers 
and mentors to express herself and channel 
her own ideals into her artform. With her 
senior recital quickly approaching, this is what 
inspired her pieces.
“Dance, but just art in general I feel, has 
been this incredibly refreshing medium for me 
to express my values and create work that feels 
impactful and important,” Butin said.
Alongside Butin, SMTD seniors Victoria 
Briones and Alyssa Winnie will be performing 
their senior dance recital titled “recollect-us” 
from Nov. 21 to Nov. 23 at 8 p.m. each night. 
Like the other seniors in the dance school, the 
trio were assigned their partners and given 
the task of creating their own show, handling 
everything from choreography to program 
design. The theme of self-reclamation was 
unanimously decided because of the personal 
experiences that each dancer has endured. 
“We all discussed what our pieces were 
looking like schematically or what ideas we 
wanted to create,” said Butin. “There were a lot 
of themes about identity and how we are aware 
of our identity both from the past and from the 
present, even the future, sometimes, ”Butin 
explained.
The whole show has been a collaborative 
project, but through this process, each dancer 

has discovered a unique way of expressing her 
ideas and how she relates to the world. The 
show is deeply personal to each dancer and 
something they’ve all been working towards 
throughout their years at the University of 
Michigan.
“It’s a more personal show,” Butin said. 
“We’re all definitely dealing with topics and 
themes that we feel are affecting our lives 
often and are important. Whether it’s in light 
of something or shedding some light on a more 
dark kind of instance. It’s definitely special to 
see people have such a personal experience on 
stage. I think this show will have a lot of that.”
Through their time in the dance program, 
the three women have formed a tight bond, 
making this opportunity to dance together 
even more special. Butin has learned a lot from 
her fellow classmates and other young artists at 
the University.
“There’s such an all-over-the-map difference 
in training and background that people come to 
the school with, and it’s been really special to 
meet other dancers and artists and collaborate 
with them,” Butin said. “Now that I’m naming 
my senior piece, I’ve been a part of a lot of 
other ones, so I’ve learned a lot from the older 
students in the department and got to hear 
voices that inform mine.”
Butin’s personal growth throughout her years 
in the dance program has come as much from 
her individual studies as from her collaborations 
with other young artists. Collaboration has 
allowed the dancers to explore new ideas and 
realize how important it is to share their voices. 
With all her previous experiences influencing 
her current performance, Butin and her fellow 
dancers have the opportunity to inform new 
artists through their art form.

Wolverines advance in NCAA Tournament 
with 2-1 first-round win over Bowling Green

In 
early 
September, 
the 
Michigan and Bowling Green 
women’s soccer teams faced off at 
the U-M Soccer Stadium. Fittingly 
for one of the season’s early games, 
the halftime entertainment was 
entitled “Pups on the Pitch.”
Last Friday, the two teams 
met again at the same place. No 
puppies were present — an accurate 
representation of the maturity 
that the Wolverines and Falcons 
accumulated between then and 
now. 
The 
early-season 
mistakes 
made by two teams about to 
catch fire through regular-season 
and 
conference 
tournaments 
disappeared. 
Ball 
and 
player 
movement from both sides was 
more 
purposeful 
and 
more 
problematic 
for 
the 
opposing 
defense. Set pieces, performed in 
a premeditated fashion, created 
more substantial opportunities on 
goal.
But when the clock hit zero, the 
result replicated the September 
outcome. With a 2-1 victory, No. 
19 Michigan (16-5-1 overall, 8-2-1 
Big Ten) advanced to the second 
round of the NCAA Tournament, 
eliminating Bowling Green (14-6-3, 
10-1-0).
The Falcons made it clear from 
the onset that they wouldn’t let the 
Wolverines play bully ball again — 
Michigan’s 16-0 shot advantage 
in the last contest took away all 
chances of Bowling Green ever 
climbing onto the scoreboard. On 
Friday, 61 percent of possession 
by both teams was at midfield 
compared to just 51.5 percent 
in the last contest, while the 
Wolverines’ possession in its final 
third fell from just over a third to 
just over a quarter. These statistics 
bear witness to Bowling Green’s 
improved ability to neutralize 
Michigan’s possessions before they 
became dangerous.
On the offensive end, the Falcons 

also 
demonstrated 
increased 
potency. Michigan coach Jennifer 
Klein acknowledged their ability 
to foil the her team’s plans to push 
the ball and players forward in 
possession.
“We wanted to lock them 
into their half and be a bit more 
aggressive in our press,” Klein 
said. “... (In) the first half, their 
movement and interchange caused 
us a little bit of problems.”
That 
scheme 
nearly 
found 
paydirt for Michigan in the fourth 
minute. 
Junior 
defender 
Alia 
Martin received a penalty kick 
opportunity, but grounded it wide 
of the left woodwork. Following 
the miss, Bowling Green recorded 
a combination of six shots, corner 
kicks and offsides calls, signaling 
its intent — and ability — to create 
higher up the field. 
In the 35th minute, the Falcons 
capitalized on this aggressiveness. 
With numbers in their final third, 
Mackenzie 
Reuber’s 
facility, 
including a touch off the chest, gave 
her the control needed to slot the 
ball into the net’s corner, just out 
of junior goalkeeper Hillary Beall’s 
reach. 
“They like to make games 
exciting and difficult,” Klein said. 
“They’ve done it all season, so 
nothing has changed.”
Bowling 
Green 
closed 
out 
the first half and opened the 
second with increased offensive 
confidence which stemmed from 
its draw of first blood. While the 
ball was concentrated around 
midfield, 
any 
possession 
that 
threatened in front of goal belonged 
to the Falcons. The frustration of 
the Wolverines’ inability to create 
and extend possessions that posed 
a serious threat was plastered on 
the face of junior midfielder Nikki 
Hernandez, who was trying to play 
a role in every third of the field. 
“As a forward I know I can’t get 
caught up just in my attacking role,” 
Hernandez said. “The team can’t all 
be an attacking team.”
But just as Bowling Green only 

needed one goal to make Michigan 
and its fans come to the sober 
realization that this game could 
be the last, the Wolverines only 
needed one to renew daydreams of 
a second round. 
With just under an hour to go, 
freshman forward Danielle Wolfe 
slid into the penalty box to poke 
a ball — played in by junior Big 
Ten Midfielder of the Year Sarah 
Stratigakis and then Hernandez 
— into the goal. When asked about 
her contribution, Wolfe, who saw 
limited minutes in relief, was 
quick to defer the results to her 
teammates.
“I just work my hardest for the 
girls who worked the whole 90 
minutes,” Wolfe said. “… Those 30 
minutes are the best 30 minutes 
that I can play.”
The game-tying goal provided 
new life for the Wolverines and 
their faithful. The former notched a 
trio of shots and a quartet of corner 
kicks in the following 12 minutes; 
the latter used their feet to pound 
out an emphatic “Let’s Go Blue” 
on the bleachers. This momentum 

made another Michigan goal seem 
inevitable. 
That’s why it came as little 
surprise when Hernandez took 
advantage of Falcon goalkeeper 
Kathleen 
Duwve’s 
abnormally 
high position in the 18-yard box, 
chipping in a goal from 26 yards 
that fluttered over Duwve’s fingers. 
The 2-1 lead in the 79th minute 
would prove to be insurmountable. 
When asked about the crucial 
tiebreaking 
goal, 
Hernandez’s 
response was simple.
“I didn’t think it was going in at 
first,” Hernandez said. “I was just 
really lucky that I got that goal.”
After weathering the Falcons’ 
continued press until all 90 minutes 
had expired, the Wolverines began 
to look forward to next week’s 
second round game against No. 15 
Texas Tech.
Wolfe 
put 
the 
night 
in 
perspective. 
“Nothing better than being 
under the lights, at home, with your 
crowd, and your whole team here,” 
Wolfe said, “and it’s the best feeling 
to be repping Michigan at home.”

In East Lansing, goaltender Hayden Lavigne lends a helping hand

Midway through the final period 
Saturday night in East Lansing, 
the Michigan hockey team (3-7-2 
overall, 0-5-1 Big Ten) went on the 
penalty kill after graduate transfer 
forward Jacob Hayhurst got called 
for roughing.
The ensuing faceoff in the 
Wolverines’ defensive zone resulted 
in notable scoring opportunities for 
Michigan State. First, defensemen 
Dennis Cesana and Jerad Rosburg 
passed back and forth before Cesana 
took a one-timer from the high slot. 
The puck was deflected by the 
goaltender before forward Patrick 
Khodorenko took possession on the 
left side. He skated to the corner 
and stayed behind the goal line 
while attacking the post. At the last 
second, he dished a pass through 
the tip of the crease to Rosburg on 
the other side, who took a shot at the 
gaping hole on the right half of the 
net. A goal looked inevitable, but the 
goaltender extended his glove and 
made the save.
That 
display 
of 
staunch 
goaltending was nothing new. It 
has been Michigan’s staple for most 
of the season and has given the 
Wolverines a chance to win in most 
games. Only this time, it was senior 
Hayden Lavigne who held out the 
hand and not sophomore Strauss 
Mann.
Michigan was down 3-0 with six 
minutes left in the second period 
when Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
decided to pull Mann to change 
things up and potentially rejuvenate 
the team.
“Just basically told him ‘Hayden 
get ready, you’re going in.’ That was 
about it,” Pearson said. “And he 
knows, I mean, he’s a veteran. He 
knows you don’t need a lot of words, 
but I did talk to him after. I told him 
I was happy for him. He played 
extremely well, and I thought he 
was really good.”
The decision put Lavigne on the 
ice for the first time this regular 
season. The last time he stood 
between the pipes was during 
an exhibition game against the 
University of Windsor in early 
October. And though his team fell 
to the Spartans, Lavigne impressed 
with 11 saves and no goals allowed 

during his time in net.
“When you start a game, your 
initial mindset is obviously just do 
what you can to win,” Lavigne said. 
“And then I think going in mid-
game, your mindset is kind of just to 
hold it where it is. You’re not really 
necessarily looking for that win. 
Obviously that’s the goal at the end 
of the day, but going in my goal there 
with 26 minutes left in the game is 
just kind of make sure that we leave 
with three on board and it doesn’t 
increase from there.”
Watching the first 11 games from 
the sideline is likely not a position 
Lavigne would have foreseen a few 
years ago. Not for a guy who, as a 
sophomore, won the starting job 
mid-season and led his team to the 
Frozen Four.
Last 
year, 
though, 
Lavigne 
couldn’t find his peak form and 
thus shared the crease with Mann. 
And at the start of this season, after 
Lavigne let up two goals in the 
exhibition, it was Mann who got the 
final nod.

That brings us to the current 
status. After coming off the bench 
against Michigan State, it took some 
time for Lavigne to settle in. His 
heart raced early, but he mentioned 
that after facing the first few shots 
he found his composure.
“It was good. I mean, I’ve been 
waiting a long time to get in a game, 
working hard in practices to make 
sure I was ready,” Lavigne said. “It’s 
definitely nerve-wracking. Kind 
of felt like a little freshman again, 
playing my first game in a while, but 
it was good. Good feeling to be back. 
Felt like I was seeing the puck well, 
just felt fast, felt good overall.”
Being a backup goalie requires 
you to be on your toes. As Saturday 
showed, Lavigne could be called 
into action at any moment and 
maintain his edge, even on the 
bench.
“I just try and stay kind of 
mentally and emotionally involved 
even though I’m on the bench,” 
Lavigne said. “Just makes it easier 
to get in there so your mind doesn’t 

have to turn on as well as your 
body when you get in.”
From 
the 
bench 
Lavigne 
stays vocal, always pointing 
out to teammates what they’re 
doing well as this helps him stay 
focused on the game. What’s 
more, he looks for tendencies 
in the opponent’s game and 
imagines how he would handle 
the various situations if he were 
playing. This routine paid off, as 
he was well prepared for the heat 
in the third period against the 
Spartans.
“I expected Khodorenko to 
just kind of drive it to the net 
since he had that little lane, 
so I went down on that post,” 
Lavigne said. “As soon as he 
released it, I just kind of knew 
that I had to get over there as fast 
as I could. Stretched my hand out 
as far forward as I could to kind 
of cut down that angle.
“It’s one of those plays where 
you play the odds and know 
where the angle is likely to be 

and then just kind of hope that it 
hits you, and that was the case. 
Just made sure I got over there 
fast and got over there aggressive 
and then luckily held on to it.”

Though it’s unclear when 
he’ll play next, Lavigne is still a 
key asset for the team. After all, 
you never know when you might 
need a helping hand.

‘M’ locks in 12th-
ranked class in 2020

In her eighth year at the 
helm of the women’s basketball 
program, 
Michigan 
coach 
Kim Barnes Arico raked in 
the 
12th-ranked 
recruiting 
class in 2020 to join the 
Wolverines, highlighted by the 
No. 30 recruit in the country — 
forward Cameron Williams.
Williams is one of four 
players to sign her letter of 
intent, and is joined by No. 40 
ranked Seattle native, guard 
Meghan Fiso, and two local 
Michigan players — guard Elise 
Stuck and forward Whitney 
Sollom.
Williams’ decision to join 
the Wolverines adds her to the 
long list of impact forwards 
recruited by Barnes Arico.
“Those kids as high school 
kids want to go to a place 
where they’re going to have 
an opportunity to learn from 
one of the best,” Barnes Arico 
said. “Naz Hillmon wanted 
to come to Michigan because 
she watched Hallie Thome 
develop over the years and 
she wanted an opportunity to 
learn from her and have a year 
to spend with her. The same 
was true when (Williams) was 
going through the recruiting 
process.”
Similar 
to 
what 
Thome 
meant 
for 
recruiting 
bigs, 
Williams could prove to be the 
catalyst for a new recruiting 
ground.
“Whitney 
Young 
High 
School is traditionally one 
of the best (basketball) high 
schools in the country,” Barnes 
Arico said. “(Williams’) head 
coach there — her husband is 
Mac Irvin, who runs the AAU 
program. They traditionally 
have one of the best AAU 
programs in the country. Year 
in, year out, they have shown 

consistency and they just do 
a tremendous job developing 
their players and building high 
character kids.”
The acquisition of Sollom 
and Stuck, from Hartland and 
Charlevoix, respectively, marks 
the Wolverines’ first addition 
of players from Michigan since 
Deja Church transferred after 
last season.
“That has really been a 
point of emphasis since I’ve 
been here is to try and get the 
best players in the state to 
stay home,” Barnes Arico said. 
“When you want to build a 
program and you want to build 
a championship culture, you 
want to do it with Michigan 
kids that really bleed maize and 
blue, were born that way and 
want to win a championship for 
their home state.”
Sollom 
and 
Stuck 
were 
also recruited by Michigan 
State, whose roster currently 
contains eight players from the 
state. Three of the Spartans 
were four star recruits in the 
2019 class and are making 
impact plays for the Spartans 
this season.
What all four recruits bring 
to the Wolverines is what 
Barnes Arico mentions every 
time she talks about recruiting 
— the experience of winning. 
Each player has moved far 
in 
their 
respective 
state 
tournaments, winning all-state 
honors along the way.
In order to win at this level, 
Michigan needs more talent to 
break into the upper echelon of 
teams, and recruiting impact 
players and gaining a foothold 
in a fertile recruiting ground is 
vital if it wants to take the next 
step. Over the last few years, 
with the acquisition of star 
recruits like Amy Dilk, Izabel 
Varejão, Hillmon and now 
Williams and Fiso, it’s slowly 
moving in that direction.

8A — Wednesday, November 20, 2019
Sports
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

The first sign that Michigan 
might retool its offense came 
months 
before 
Josh 
Gattis 
was hired to take over the 
coordinator role.
Giles Jackson, then a four-
star whose position in college 
was at question, committed 
last September. His skillset, 
based around speed, not size 
or technique, didn’t seem to 
fit into Jim Harbaugh and Pep 
Hamilton’s offense. To succeed 
as a receiver, Jackson would 
need to be put into open space, 
where he could make use of that 
skill set and pick up yardage 
after the catch.
Gattis, of course, has built 
his offense around that very 
concept.
Jackson hasn’t been much of 
a factor in the receiving game 
his freshman year with three 
established starters atop the 
depth chart. Still, he’s made 
a name for himself as a kick 
returner, and found the field on 
offense when the Wolverines 
see chances for him to stretch 
the field on sweeps or end 
arounds. 
Technically speaking, it isn’t 
the offense he signed up for 
when he committed. But it’s one 
that fits him.
“I think (my game) helps a 
lot,” Jackson said. “Me and Mike 
(Sainristil), we’re similar. We 
both use that to our advantage 
in our offense on like the swings 
and bubbles, using our speed to 
try to beat everybody out, and I 
think that helps us a lot.”
Cornelius Johnson, another 
freshman receiver who stepped 
into 
an 
offense 
that 
was 
perhaps different than what he 
expected, was across the room 
talking to media at the same 
time as Jackson. A Connecticut 

native, Johnson was recruited 
by Gattis to play for Alabama, 
but didn’t see him at Michigan 
until the spring game.
There’s 
a 
stereotypical 
adjustment 
period 
for 
freshmen, at any position in 
any sport that both Jackson and 
Johnson 
discussed. 
Jackson 
said 
remembering 
a 
more 
nuanced playbook took time; 
Johnson 
said 
he 
struggled 
with the increased time on 
the sideline between drives. 
That 
adjustment, 
though, 
came with the added layer of 
the Wolverines’ new offense. 
One that, as any onlooker 
could plainly see, took time for 
everyone to get comfortable in.
“I feel like all our receivers 
can actually do it,” Jackson said. 
“Like I said, little details matter 
and that helps us a lot. Just 
showing every step in a route. 
We can’t take a play for granted. 
We’re never going to get a play 
back, so we just have to do every 
play to our fullest ability.”
Keeping with the theme of 
the last few weeks, Johnson 
said the Wolverines haven’t 
changed what they’re doing on 
offense. Merely, the execution 
has gotten to where it needs 
to be. “Doing a terrific job,” 
Harbaugh said Monday when 
asked about Gattis. “I think we 
talk pretty much every week 
how I feel about the job that he’s 
doing.”
Whether 
anything 
big-
picture 
has 
changed 
with 
Gattis is, in a sense, moot. The 
Wolverines are moving the 
ball with far more ease, and 
that’s what matters. At the tail 
end of Saturday’s 44-10 win 
over Michigan State, Johnson 
entered the game due to the 
lopsided score. Patterson faked 
a handoff and rolled out, causing 
a defender to overcommit and 
giving Johnson 30 yards of open 

field to work with. It ended in a 
pitch-and-catch touchdown.
“I was not surprised at how 
open I was, cause that was the 
designed play,” Johnson said. 
“I was definitely expecting the 
ball on that play.”
Tangibly, that play is the 
biggest impact either he or 
Jackson have had on the offense 
this year. But they both know 
what they can do in the offense. 
And they want this year to be 
just the beginning.
“Sometimes, 
me, 
Mike, 
(Cornelius Johnson), George 
(Johnson), we’ll all talk about 
how n=ext year, as time goes 
on, we’ll be the big receivers on 
campus,” Jackson said. “Just 
got to keep grinding, one day 
we’ll get to it.”

Shea 
Patterson 
faked 
the 
handoff, rolled to his left and 
threw to tight end Sean McKeon 
in the flat. Ahead of McKeon 
was sophomore wide receiver 
Ronnie Bell, who plowed into an 
unsuspecting defensive back and 
knocked him down. With mostly 
open space ahead of him, McKeon 
gained an easy 19 yards.
Bell’s 
block 
was 
perhaps 
the best example of improved 
blocking from Michigan’s wide 
receivers over the past month or 
so. While blocking isn’t nearly as 
glamorous as catching passes or 
scoring touchdowns, it’s equally 
important, and the Wolverines’ 
receiver room has taken that 

message to heart.
“That’s been a really good thing 
for our team,” said Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh on Monday. 
“I’d say probably four or five 
weeks ago, it just — we were at a 
point early where it wasn’t that 
good and that’s an area we really 
value. Really gotten better. Really 
improved steadily and it was at its 
best in the past game. That’s been 
a real focus for us and how to get 
yards after contact, tackles will 
get guys blocked. If you don’t have 
the ball, to me you’re a blocker on a 
down or play and that was big this 
week.”
When Bell was young and still 
learning the game, his dad gave 
him a word of advice: If you can’t 
block, you can’t play. So Bell has 
made blocking into something 
personal, and the message has 
spread.
“Every receiver’s just blocked 
their tail off this year,” Bell said. 
“And it’s been a lot of fun to watch 
it on film.”
Johnson on his first touchdown
With 2:33 left in the Wolverines’ 
44-10 win over Michigan State on 
Saturday, freshman wide receiver 
Cornelius Johnson found himself 
wide open.
Like, wide open.
As Patterson took the snap, 
Johnson bluffed a block, pursuing 
his man briefly before breaking 
free downfield. Patterson found 
him around the 25-yard line 
and, with no one in front of him, 
Johnson coasted into the end zone.
“I was not surprised how open 
I was because that was the design 
of the play,” Johnson said Tuesday. 
“So I was definitely expecting the 
ball on that play. That was the 
playcall.”
In the moment, Johnson wasn’t 
thinking about the rivalry or the 
hundreds of thousands of fans 
in the stadium. All he focused on 
was the ball, and it paid off. The 
39-yard reception was Michigan’s 

second-longest of the day.
“I was just like, ‘Now’s my 
opportunity,’ ” Johnson said. 
“I knew what I was doing, I’d 
practiced it so many times and 
everything. 
Just, 
now’s 
my 
opportunity and you gotta focus.”
Bell still seeking first score
This season, Bell leads the 
team with 621 yards on 37 catches, 
but he still hasn’t found the end 
zone despite several close calls — 
including one on Saturday when 
he was tackled at the 3-yard line.
After Saturday’s game, Johnson 
joked around with Bell, asking, 
“Who’s got more touchdowns?”
Of course, it was all in good 
fun. Whether or not he has a 
touchdown to his name, Bell 
has been one of the Wolverines’ 
most productive receivers. Still, 
the numbers don’t lie, and Bell 
admitted: “He got me.”
“I thought that was funny,” 
Johnson said. “It was like my 
fourth catch. Ever.”
Bell’s teammates haven’t lost 
any trust after Bell dropped the 
potential game-tying reception 
at Penn State last month. In 
that moment, Bell felt he had let 
everybody down. But the team 
lifted him up and made it clear that 
he wasn’t the reason they lost the 
game. After being limited against 
Notre Dame and Maryland due to 
injury, Bell continued his status 
as 
Patterson’s 
favorite 
target 
Saturday, with nine receptions for 
150 yards.
Now, the Wolverines have truly 
hit their stride on offense, scoring 
30 or more points in the three 
games since, and Bell has been as 
big a part of that as anyone.
“It was just funny cause 
technically 
I 
got 
more 
touchdowns, but obviously he has 
like the most yards and catches 
on the team,” Johnson said. “I’m 
happy for Ronnie. He’s gonna push 
it. He’ll get tons of touchdowns for 
sure.”

Cruise control

With emerging weapons on offense and a steady defense, the Michigan football team is feeling good ahead of Saturday

A transition in transition: Analyzing Isaiah Livers’ success on the break

When 
Juwan 
Howard 
returned to Ann Arbor, it was 
a 
foregone 
conclusion 
that 
he’d bring his wealth of NBA 
experience with him.
Now in his first year as the 
coach of the Michigan men’s 
basketball 
team, 
Howard’s 
experience as an NBA player 
and coach is shining through. 
The area of the game in which 
it’s most obvious, though, is in 
transition offense. As a result, 
the Wolverines are humming 
along in an up-tempo offense 
that’s seemingly starting to 
become second nature.
Under former coach John 
Beilein, 
Michigan’s 
offense 
finished 341st in the nation 
in possessions per game last 
season. While the Wolverines 
averaged just under 57 shots per 
game in 2018, they’ve eclipsed 
that mark in three of their first 
four contests this season.
Thus 
far, 
the 
biggest 
beneficiary of the stark change 
is junior forward Isaiah Livers. 
To shed light on Livers’ success, 
The Daily broke down the film:
First and foremost, Livers’ 
most impactful strength is his 
combination of athleticism and 
ability to beat the defense to 
the rim. Because Michigan’s 
frontcourt presents so much 
size, Livers is afforded the 
liberty of leaking out if his 
defensive assignment is away 
from the rim.
At 6-foot-7, his long strides 
allow him to cover the court 
quickly. That much was apparent 
against Saginaw Valley State, 
particularly in the early going. 
Just three minutes into the 
exhibition, senior point guard 
Zavier Simpson found Livers 
lurking behind the defense after 
the Wolverines secured a loose 
ball.
From just in front of the logo, 
Simpson lobbed a pass over the 
lone defender standing between 
him and Livers. The defender 
made 
an 
effort 
to 
contest 
Livers, but stood no chance as 
he barreled to the rim. Livers’ 
sheer athleticism allowed him 

to elevate over his defender as 
he flushed home Simpson’s feed 
with two hands.
On the very next possession, 
Livers’ speed in the open floor 
allowed him to get to the rim 
for another dunk. When senior 
center Jon Teske pulled down 
the rebound, Livers was the 
furthest player from the basket. 
With a Cardinals player on his 
hip and the other four defenders 
standing between him and the 
rim, Livers took off in a full 
sprint, out-running two of them.
When he saw the fourth 
defender stop the ball and the 
fifth bolt towards junior guard 
Eli Brooks in the corner, he 
angled 
himself 
toward 
the 
basket. Livers then kicked his 
speed into top gear, reeling 
in a chest pass from Simpson 
in stride, reaching the paint 
without putting the ball on the 

deck.
Against 
Creighton, 
Livers 
showed no hesitation in running 
alongside Brooks following his 
steal. 
Seeing 
that 
Brooks 
was 
drifting 
towards 
the 
opposite 
wing, 
Livers correctly 
filled the lane, 
creating an angle 
that made it easy 
for 
Brooks 
to 
float 
an 
alley-
oop pass. When 
both 
defenders 
committed to Brooks, Livers was 
left all alone for the two-handed 
slam.
With the NBA’s emerging 
emphasis 
on 
transition 
3-pointers 
in 
recent 
years, 
Howard has given his team the 
green light to let uncontested 

looks fly. Livers, in particular, 
has taken advantage. Even when 
Simpson slows down the pace in 
transition, Livers still hunts for 
his own shot.
While 
the 
thunderous 
dunks 
against 
Saginaw 
Valley 
State stand out, 
Livers was just as 
effective at slower 
speeds. 
When 
the 
ball 
began 
ahead of him, he 
often hung back 
and 
read 
the 
defense. If the Cardinals failed to 
communicate, which happened 
twice, he’d find an open spot 
along the arc and make them pay.
Delaying his transition from 
offense to defense until the ball 
crossed 
halfcourt 
forced the 
opposing defense to communicate 

as Simpson brought the ball up. 
Twice, miscommunitcation led to 
two defenders guarding the same 
player, leaving Livers open for a 
walk-up triple.
In the instances in which Livers 
doesn’t beat the defense to the rim 
or no passing angle presents itself, 
he still keeps himself in the play. 
About midway through the second 
half against Saginaw Valley State, 
two 
defenders 
converged 
on 
Simpson at halfcourt as Livers 
sprinted ahead of him. Simpson 
couldn’t find an angle to get him 
the ball, and with sophomore 
forwards Brandon Johns Jr. and 
Colin Castleton trailing a few 
steps behind him, Livers filled out 
to the corner.
The decision not only cleared 
some of the paint congestion for 
the driving Simpson and trailing 
forwards, but also created a new 
passing window for him to get 

the ball. When Livers’ defender 
remained in the paint to help stop 
Simpson, Livers was left alone 
in the corner for an uncontested 
3-pointer. Simpson, a creative 
passer, made the mid-air hook 
pass to the corner look easy and 
Livers canned the triple.
Altogether, Livers’ ability to 
beat defenders down the floor, 
finish at the rim and knock 
down the long ball add value 
to a Michigan offense that lost 
its three leading scorers from a 
season ago. With prized freshman 
wing 
Franz 
Wagner 
still 
recovering from a fractured wrist, 
the Wolverines will continue to 
lean on Livers in transition.
As the schedule gets tougher 
over the next few weeks, Livers’ 
ability to score in transition 
may be the difference in a 
number of potential signature 
wins.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | NOVEMBER 13, 2019

W

e left the farm to begin our 
weekly climb up the hill to 
the chapel. The cell reception 
was better toward the top of the slope, so 
we often went there before dusk to call fam-
ily and friends thousands of miles away. The 
dogs barked ahead of us in excitement as we 
used the sturdy walking sticks to support 
our weight. Despite the fading colors and 
chipped paint on its walls, the church’s green 
columns and blue structure shined in the set-
ting sun’s gaze.
We entered the shadows under the bal-
cony to catch our breath and shield our-
selves from the intense sunlight. I pulled out 
my phone to call my parents as usual. After 
updating them with what I had been doing 
that week, I swiped down to scan through 
hundreds of push notifications, pausing to 
glance at the headlines about the Democratic 
presidential primary and Special Counsel 
Robert Mueller’s testimony. I continued to 
peruse through weeks of news until an email 
with the words “Shootings” and “Kashmir” 
caught my attention. I felt an ache in my 
chest as I read the evening news briefing 
from the New York Times.
Two mass shootings had occurred in 
Dayton and El Paso two days before the 
Aug. 5 briefing, which I was reading on the 
ninth — almost a week after the violence 
had occurred. I didn’t have time to process 
that information since I also read the Indian 
government revoked Kashmir’s semi-auton-
omous status and sent in its forces to occupy 
the region.
I was silent on the walk back to the farm, 
distressed by how much had happened 
without me learning about it. What else did 
I miss? What other events happened in the 
world that just slipped right by me?
T

his past summer, I interned with 
a small, family-run organization 
in La Bolivarense, a rural sector in 
northwest Ecuador. We came to document 
the history of the region since many of the 
original founders still live there, offering a 
unique opportunity to foster community 
engagement. 
Though it was no doubt a rewarding expe-
rience to work within a community and to 

cultivate a greater understanding of its ori-
gins, there was a certain irony in my being 
there. For, while I was in Ecuador, I couldn’t 
help but lament the sacrifice I had made in 
losing access to news on global and domestic 
events.
It should come as no surprise, coming from 
a student journalist, I’m an avid consumer 
of news. As a New York Times subscriber, I 
check the newspaper’s online front page a 
few times a day. Whenever a big event hap-
pens, I read an article about the subject from 
every news outlet I can, and I watch at least 
two or three videos of political analysis, too. 
Following the news has essentially taken up 
the mantle that television and movies once 
held. Being caught in the 24-hour news cycle 
means it’s hard to step back and slow down.
Going to a remote location in Ecuador 
with essentially no access to the internet 
meant I would have to put reading news 
on hold. My discovery at the chapel 
highlighted the anxiety I experienced 
from distancing myself from a 24-hour 
news cycle. I was so accustomed to the 
rapid consumption and constant access 
to information that its absence left me 
a wide-eyed addict desperate for long-
form profiles and breaking news pieces. 
The absence of news in my life 
changed my behavior while living with 
my host family. I repeatedly swiped 
down to refresh my email, even when I 
knew I’d be met with a “No connection” 
message at the bottom of my screen. It 
was equally frustrating when I did have 
a connection and email briefings still 
wouldn’t load properly. I even resorted 
to crouching in the bathroom and peer-
ing at the newspapers written in Span-
ish along the floor, only to find that they 
were three years old. I read them any-
way.
My hysteria subsided with time, and 
as I focused on our project, I began to 
see what kind of life I’d live if national 
and global news wasn’t always at my 
fingertips. We woke up at seven every 
morning to help feed the guinea pigs 
and chickens on the farm and clean 
their cages. We walked for hours in 

direct sunlight to meet with founders from 
the community. The interviews themselves 
ranged from 30-minute to hour-long conver-
sations. The work was grueling, yet there was 
a greater intimacy in the moment-to-moment 
routine of the days. We were engaged with-
out the opportunity for digital distractions or 
pings from CNN to hijack our attention. 
While I still talked about news with the 
other interns and the host family, our con-
versations were intimate as we weaved per-
sonal narratives into our discussions and 
talked about how natural disasters, politics 
and significant events impacted our lives. 
The internship gave me the opportunity to 
see how reading the news nonstop with the 
intent of being aware actually made me more 
distant from issues that mattered to those 
around me. Our history project was a work 
of news, yes, but unlike national news, it was, 

in a sense, a work of community journalism 
made by and for La Bolivarense. It enhanced 
connections within the town rather than 
detracting from them as a national news 
story might.
When I came back to Chicago in August, 
I initially regressed back into my constant 
digestion of domestic and international 
news. So much continues to happen, and 
being an informed citizen demands that we 
engage with journalism. But every now and 
then, when I get especially busy, I’m able to 
take a step back from the news cycle and take 
it in piecemeal through briefings rather than 
my daily binge reading. I’m more attentive 
in my own life and in the global news world 
when I can take it slower. Now, I recognize 
how some of the greatest “news stories” 
in my life might appear right in front of me 
rather than on a front page.

Disconnecting to connect: Thoughts on 
the 24-hr news cycle

BY ARJUN THAKKAR, STATEMENT COLUMNIST

ILLUSTRATION BY CASEY TIN AND KATE GLAD


I 

was in a witchy mood on Halloween. It 
was raining, and I was walking while 
listening to the Modern Love podcast 
when I saw something glittering in a puddle. 
It was an engagement ring.
A sad Titanic, its stone was half-sunken in 
mud and pointed up like the bow of a ship. 
Instead of a single, perfect circle, the gold 
band had an arm split off that held the gem 
in its claws. I rescued it from the water in 
hopes it held a story.
I brought it to Noodles & Company to 
take a better look and ordered a drink. The 
cashier hesitated. “I know you just got a 
drink, but I still have to put in a name for the 
order. Got a fake name?”
I said, “Witch.”
She 
laughed. 
“OK, 
Witch, 
happy 
Halloween.” Then, she winked.
Or maybe I’m just including the wink to 
make this story sound more witchy. Over the 
past year, a lot of people have told me I have 
a “witchy vibe,” and I’ve secretly liked this 
new identity — it’s special, supernatural and 
makes my strange stories seem like more 
than just coincidences.
I do have a lot of witchy stories. An artist 
once approached me in a Trader Joe’s 
parking lot and gave me a photo identical 
to one my cousin showed me that morning. 
My clock stopped the moment my great-
grandmother passed away. My grandfather 
opened his eyes in the hospital when I touched 
him. I experienced a one-person hail storm on a 
mountain in Santa Fe. While telling these stories to 
a friend, the petals on a flower behind me fell to the 
ground. 
I was convinced this ring was just another witchy 
thing that happened to me — and I needed to know 
the story. 
I posted an ad in the Ladies of UofM Facebook 
group and plenty of people commented telling me to 
turn it in to the police. I became more defensive with 
every comment — I didn’t trust the police to get the 
ring back to the owner. I felt eerily attached to it, like 
I owed something to the ring.
I wore the ring for the rest of the night.
T

he next day, I received a message from 
someone named Carey. We had no mutual 
friends. 
“Hi Hannah!” her message read. “I lost my mom’s 
ring 2 days ago and was wondering if you found it? It’s 
a simple design with a white sapphire. I’m looking to 
see if I have a pic of it somewhere!”
I sent the photo before she could describe it to me. 
Within minutes, Carey confirmed the ring was hers 
and insisted on bringing me a gift. Instead, I asked her 
to bring me the story. 
We met a few days later, and she told me the ring’s 
saga. In 1985, her father visited India from the U.S. 
to see his family, and while he was there, he was 
introduced to over 25 women to marry. He fell for 
Carey’s mother and sent her love poems for a year, 
including the ring in his final poem to propose.
Carey’s mother came to the U.S. the following 

year. Since then, Carey’s father has bought her 
mother plenty of rings, so she no longer wears the 
one I found.
The two of us exchanged more stories and ended 
up talking for two hours — I learned Carey is also a 
writer, and we discussed our hopes to make systemic 
change through journalism. We decided to meet 
again and continued messaging on Facebook.
I asked Carey to tell me more about her mother 
later that week. She responded that her mother is a 
witch; apparently, the woman has flat-lined twice and 
her blood sugar is regularly at a level that would kill 
a normal person. Carey needed some of her mother’s 
luck for an important meeting and borrowed the ring 
without asking permission. In the end, she never got 
to use its magic. The ring was lost by the time she 
arrived.
W

hile writing this piece, I wanted it so badly 
to prove that witches are real, that I’m a 
witch, that Carey’s mother is a witch, and 
why not Carey, too? I told the story to my partner, and 
he simply responded, “Writers are witches.”
Then it hit me: He’s right. I’m not a witch, I’m a 
writer. Not only that, this is a Modern Love column 
and I’m a modern love writer, which means I know 
there are stories happening all the time — we just 
need to ask ourselves the right questions. Instead of 
turning in the ring to the police, or keeping it, or even 
accepting whatever coffee or dinner Carey wanted to 
give me as a reward, I asked about her story because I 
knew there was one.
I figured it was the work of mysterious magic 
that Carey and I had met and held many of the same 

thoughts on systemic issues and activism. Our nearly-
two-hour discussion touched on ideas also covered by 
adrienne marie brown, a self-proclaimed witch and 
Detroit writer whose theory of “emergent strategy” 
shows how small systems incite larger-scale change. 
In other words, if more people found connections 
like how Carey and I found each other, these tiny 
interactions will multiply to create a larger movement.
brown cites fractals in this argument, which are 
small, repeated patterns that create larger systems 
(think the designs of snowflakes or seashells). Fractals 
appear in math, too, with the “magical” Fibonacci 
Sequence where each number is the sum of the two 
numbers before it. When squares are created using 
these numbers as the base and height, they stack on 
top of each other perfectly to create a symbol called 
the Golden Ratio.
You may have seen the Golden Ratio before — it 
looks like a spiral, or a shell opening up. It also sort of 
looks like Carey’s mother’s gold ring, with the stone 
being held on an arm separate from the band.
But then again, maybe that’s just me prescribing 
witchiness to the situation.
I’m not sure why I was the person who picked up 
Carey’s ring after it had been lying in a puddle for 
almost two days. Part of me wants to think there’s a 
reason we were meant to meet and connect, to discuss 
systems of change when we were engaging in them all 
along. Another part of me believes these stories could 
happen a lot more if we knew where to look. Maybe 
it’s witchcraft, or maybe it’s part of a larger pattern. 
Maybe it’s even love.
Or maybe those are all the same thing.

Modern Love: I think you found 
my mother’s ring

ILLUSTRATION BY JONATHAN WALSH


A 

few summers ago, I moved to Reykjavík to research 
the Scandinavian human rights framework. The 
land was a playground, and every night my friends 
and I played. Natural trampolines of thick moss, crystal clear 
geothermal pools tucked in the mountains and a clan of cats 
roaming the streets gave us unfettered fun. Knowing I was 
there for research, many of my friends would offer ideas 
about the history of Iceland, how they wish it’d been written, 
and how it had been instead. Other times I found myself in the 
company of those close to the center of political change, like 
the night I shared a cab home from a party with the former 
prime minister’s son. But I learned more about issues of 
disarmament and human rights by accident, in the interludes 
when I wasn’t looking for answers. 
One night, while a friend and I drove through Iceland’s 
ceaseless daylight, she turned to me and asked if I had ever 
seen a gun. I scoffed, but she was sincere. She had never seen 
one in her life, though she glimpsed partial images of them on 
some American television shows. I had seen guns more times 
than I could count: holstered, cocked, displayed, pointed, 
referenced, possessed, carried. Didn’t that make me anxious? 
She wanted to know. Though my instinct was to defend my 
normal, I wondered, “Does the overwhelming presence of 
weaponry cause anxiety?” Surely, she’d seen guns, I insisted, 
like when she got pulled over for speeding, as she always did. 
“Why should that entail guns?” She asked. Now it was her 
turn to scoff. 
Guns are written into the American fabric. America’s 
propensity for violence is undisputed, and its perpetuation by 
guns is unignorable. And while it is estimated that nearly half 
of American households own a gun or firearm, many more 
Americans have likely seen guns firsthand. We encounter 
guns all the time, like at the entrances to concert venues 
or music festivals, patrolling sporting events or any other 
number of the places we go for leisure. Despite the carnage 

guns are responsible for, they are a staple of the places we go 
to enjoy our lives. Why? 
Guns have become a feature of American life, in large 
part, because of their proliferation among the police. To the 
moderate, gun presence is non-alarming; to the ambivalent, 
normal; and to the realist, necessary. But we have to question 
the ubiquity of armed state actors and interrogate the 
perceived irreversibility of our systems of state security. 
In the social contract theories which undergird our 
relationship to our government, we are promised security, 
and in exchange for some personal liberties, we nominate 
the state as our protectorate. But what happens when our 
protectorate fails to keep us safe? It’s more likely than you 
think. Over the past two years alone, nearly 2,000 people 

were reported killed extrajudicially by police in the U.S. 
When combined with the first months of 2019, the three-year 
total reaches 2,779. 
Research shows this is not a universal phenomenon. 
In many places around the world, including the United 
Kingdom, Norway and New Zealand, police are unarmed, 
or must go through extensive reporting processes to receive 
permission to unlock the arms they travel with. More 
alarming than the American statistics is the nonchalance 
with which we address the matter; officers who commit 
on-duty manslaughter rarely face charges, and instead, 
they are granted paid time off. We reward those employed 
to protect us even when they fail to do so and neglect to 
hold them accountable for the killings they commit against 
everyday citizens. We as a nation have come to believe in, and 
ironically, protect, a “thin blue line,” but in doing so, we forget 
that the government can train more cops anytime it chooses. 
It’s us citizens that have only one chance.
For a long time, I clung to the words of Bertha Von Suttner 
in her nearly 500-page manifesto, “Lay Down Your Arms,” 
which, when read by her friend Alfred, led to the creation 
of the Nobel Peace Prize, and, when read by me, rekindled 
a personal commitment in my scholarship to understand, 
track and eradicate weapon proliferation and violent 
conflict. While I still feel pulled to her ideals of total civilian 
disarmament, I know now there is nuance in the way we 
negotiate our safety. 
As the nation pushes for gun control more broadly and 
deeply, it’s necessary to consider which communities would be 
most impacted by the loss of providing for their own personal 
protection. If the constitutional idea underpinning citizen 
weaponry is to maintain a way to overpower the government 
when necessary, we should think again about whether 
handfuls of handguns can really counteract the world’s most 
powerful military and most entrenched military-industrial 

complex. If gun control calls for the radical abandonment of 
personal weapons, we’ll have to have our security guaranteed. 
State actors, like the police, are supposed to make manifest 
that security, but the modern system of American policing 
cannot make that promise. 
A few months ago in London, another hub of unarmed 
police, a friend and I were headed out to enjoy one of the rare 
sunny days of spring with a picnic in one of the many sprawling 
gardens on the city’s north side. After taking double-decker 
buses most of the way, we jumped out to walk the remaining 
blocks, hoping to maximize the time we’d spend in the light. 
The route we took was haphazard, and we walked behind 
dumpsters, over driveways and through seemingly privately-
owned lawns. I resisted. I wanted to return to a path, a bus, a 

designated area where we could not be penalized. “What are 
you so afraid of?” My friend demanded of me. In hindsight 
I don’t know if we were on private or prohibited property, 
another largely American concept, or that it would even 
be policed if we were. But my fear of punitive action that 
overuses force is not unfounded.
My parents always worry before I go abroad about the 
multitude of dangers that might befall me, but I’ve always 
been more afraid of late nights driving alone on overpoliced 
Michigan highways — when the darkness of night makes 
abuses of authority more untraceable, unpunishable — than 
I ever have of shenanigans under other sovereigns. Because, 
while seeing guns is a facet of American public life, still more 
disconcerting are the times we don’t see them. 
In Michigan, cops have concealed carry licenses, which 
means off-duty officers carrying their government-issued 
firearms and handguns can do so in secret, ensuring fellow 
citizens cannot see they are armed. What could be the purpose 
of hiding a gun on someone’s person in the public spaces we 
share? Are police officers never off-duty, just undercover? 
Are they to be vigilant at all times, prepared to launch into 
armed attacks in situations where they are not beckoned? We 
know the consequences of this are high. Take the recent case 
against former officer Amber Guyger, who was “off-duty” 
but armed when she mistakenly entered a Dallas apartment 
which was not her own, but her neighbor’s, who she mistook 
for an intruder and shot and killed them. How are citizens to 
survive when they cannot know the fight they are up against?
My childhood home was part of that American half which 
has a gun. It never provided any semblance of security to me. 
As a young girl, I knew only that I could not go near it nor 
touch it, and as a young adult I wanted nothing to do with it. 
This guttural reaction of distrust of weaponry transfers to 
the institution of armed policing; it is not a criticism of those 
individuals who feel they are serving the country and its 

people. In fact, my original interest in, and insider knowledge 
about, security forces comes from a deeply personal 
connection. My father is a police officer, and he offered 
candidness about a system that desperately needs reform. 
From his vantage point, police militarization seemed only to 
create domestic warzones, and it was this observation and his 
doubts about the institution’s ability to provide justice that 
inspired me to question it further. The gun in my household 
was a police gun. It makes no difference.
I know the answer to the question asked of me in Iceland 
now … and it is, “Yes, I am anxious.” Armed, unchecked 
figures of authority have given me every reason to be. So, 
when we decide to say lay down your arms, I want this to 
mean lay down our arms inclusively.

Is it worth it?

a small platform to jump down and tied a rope to swing into the 
water. Beer cans and other garbage litter the small makeshift 
beachfront. I have been to that tree once, and I will never go 
back.
I

t was the summer after senior year of high school, and 
I was high off of graduation and my recent trip to India 
and Vietnam. After hearing about many friends’ fun 
expeditions to the swimming hole, I finally decided to tag along. 
My mom later joked, rather morbidly, that I had been completely 
fine traveling through Vietnam with only my sister, but nearly 
died upon returning to the United States. 
On a standard D.C. August afternoon with blistering 
temperatures and humidity, Sam, Fox, Fox’s girlfriend Pauline 
and I piled into Sam’s 20-year-old Toyota. We drove along 
the George Washington Memorial Parkway until we reached 
the scenic overlook where we parked and headed down the 
improvised trail to the swimming hole. The spot is very isolated; 
you have to climb down nearly 100 feet on a steep cliff face, 
where someone tied a rope to some roots to help you rappel your 
way down, and then once you reach the river, you walk another 
few hundred feet alongside the river to reach the tree.
Once we reached the swimming hole, we set up our little camp 
with a couple towels and the snacks and drinks we brought with 
us. Several other groups of people were already there, sharing 
the communal space (and our chips). Being more adventurous 
than me, Fox and Sam both immediately scampered up the 
tree, grabbed onto the rope and Tarzan-swung into the water. 
I, being much more nervous and cautious, slowly climbed up the 
tree, gripping each plank as I went. I stood at the top, staring at 
the water twenty feet below. I wasn’t confident enough to swing 
on the rope; if I lost my grip or held on too long, I could fall into 
shallow water. Eventually, enough people heckled me that I 
plugged my nose, closed my eyes and stepped off the platform, 
not really jumping off, more so ungracefully falling off into the 
river. Somewhere in the 20 feet of airtime between the tree and 
the water, my feet ended up above my butt, so I landed square on 
my ass — it proceeded to hurt for the next hour. I had my fill of 
adventure for the day and decided not to try it again. 
We spent the next several hours like this, chatting among 
ourselves and with the other groups there, interspersed with the 
occasional swim when the heat became unbearable. Someone I 
didn’t know gave me a beer, and we shared the tortilla chips and 
salsa we brought with everyone else. By the time evening came 
(though there were still at least two hours until sunset), almost 
all of the other groups had left, except for us and one other group 
of five guys. They were still mostly friendly, but only spoke 
Spanish, so Pauline and I could speak with them, but not Sam 
or Fox. Pauline and I continued chatting with the five of them 
intermittently, with Fox and Sam awkwardly left out, but after 
a few minutes the five of them turned inward and spoke only 
among themselves with the occasional glance in our direction.
We thought about leaving, feeling a little threatened, but 
convinced ourselves that this was nonsense. After all, over 
several hours, we shared our food with them, conversed with 
them, participated together in a classic summer activity and 
coexisted in a communal place. If something was going to 
happen, we surmised, it would’ve happened already. If you can’t 
trust people in a space like that, where can you trust someone? 
Who could be the kind of monster who would do all of those 
things with a group of people and still wrong them in the end? 
Our judgement got in the way. Things got worse. They started 
harassing Pauline, talking about how Fox “wasn’t man enough” 
and that she should date one of them instead. They were 
obviously a little drunk and started talking shit about us. The 
about-face was very sudden. We had been having a good time 
up until then, but now knew something was very, very wrong. 
Escape seemed impossible, as they were standing above us on 
the “beach” and blocking the only way out; even if we made it 
past them, it was another 100 feet climbing straight up to reach

the cars. After a few minutes of this taunting, 
however, they simply got up and left and walked 
away. It seemed that we were in the clear. Relieved, 
we started to pack up our things and prepared to 
head out.
At that moment, two of the five came back 
wearing bandanas over their faces. This almost 
made me laugh — as if a bandana was going to 
stop us from recognizing someone we had shared 
an entire day with, or from identifying them in a 
police line-up. It wasn’t funny when I saw a flash of 
silver, and I realized that one of them was carrying 
a handgun. They started yelling at us in Spanish as 
they waved the gun in our faces, telling us to give 
them everything. Of course, we obliged, tossing 
over all of our bags, begging them hysterically not 
to kill us. They told us to get in the tree and the four 
of us ran toward the tree and started to climb up. 
Changing their minds, they instead yelled at us 
to get in the water. We instead started frantically 
toward the water, Pauline and I still pleading for 
our lives in Spanish as Fox and Sam just tried to 
figure out what they wanted. If they wanted to kill 
us there, they could have gotten away with it. And 
they almost did. 
In a single-file line, we trudged down the bank as 
quickly as we could toward the water. I was last. I 
turned around to see him holding the gun with his 
arm extended, heard the quiet but powerful *click* 
as he cocked the hammer, the barrel a foot from 
my face, aimed directly at my head. That sound 
will stick with me forever. I thought I was going 
to die, but fortunately instinct kicked in. Before 
they had a chance to shoot us, we had all jumped 
into the water and swam away from the shore and 
were swept downstream by the swift current in the 
middle of the river. 
Pauline immediately began having a panic attack 
— she still had her shoes on and was being weighed 
down, struggling to keep her head above the water. 
The three of us circled her, trying to make sure she 
didn’t fucking drown. Fortunately, we spotted a 
paddle boarder and Fox swam away to wave him 
down; he quickly paddled toward us and threw 
Pauline his life jacket. He helped escort us across 
the water as there was nowhere convenient to 
get out on the other side of the river. It was a slow 
process, taking many breaks to rest on my back 
or hold onto the paddle board. The current in the 
Potomac in August is dangerous from all the rain 
D.C. gets in the summer (a detective told us he was 
surprised we survived, as most people who try to 
swim across the river at this time of year drown).
After at least 15 minutes of swimming, our feet 
touched the mud on the other side of the river, a few 
hundred feet downstream from a boathouse called 
Fletcher’s Cove. We used the paddle boarder’s 
phone to call the police and told them to meet us at 
the Cove. The police arrived right as we walked up 
from the river bank, bedraggled, covered in mud, 
only in our swim trunks without shoes or any other 
possessions. We described to them what happened, 
and they called in a goddamn helicopter and a 
police boat to look for them — which seemed a little 
extra. They found a couple of people who matched 
the description, but it wasn’t them. Whoever it was 
is still out there.

I called my mom from a cop’s phone and very 
nonchalantly told her what had happened — that 
we had been robbed, but we were ok and could she 
please pick me up. I think my tone threw her off — 
she just replied “ok, sure” before a pause and then 
the inevitable, “Wait, WHAT?!” But physically, I 
was fine. All of our parents came to get us and bring 
us clean clothes, shoes, towels and maybe a sense of 
security. I tracked my phone from the cop’s phone, 
and that must have scared the robbers when they 
realized it was being tracked, as the cops found 
my bag on the other side of the river with almost 
everything in it and returned it to me within an 
hour. My total financial loss from this? Ten dollars 
cash that was in my wallet. I went home and slept 
for 12 hours.

When you see the statistics for all-too-frequent 
mass shootings on the news, they recount the 
number of dead and wounded. The survivors are 
called “lucky” because they happened to be in a 
better place at a better time when the shooting 
occurred. Media outlets rarely report on their 
psychological damage, or the damage caused from 
all of the less “sensational” gun violence that 
occurs in this country every day. The body 
count for my incident? 
Zero dead, zero wounded. 
Probably less than $100 
value stolen from the four 
of us collectively. 
A success story. 
There are no statistics 
about the fact that I no 
longer feel safe in any 
communal space, that, at 
any moment, I have an 
exit strategy, preparing for 
anything to walk through 
the door. Because in this 
country, that’s likely. 
I had been robbed once 
before — when I was 12, 
but that was by some 
random guy in an alley, 
without a gun. An alley 
is somewhere you might 
expect to get robbed, and 
without the gun, my life 
was never in danger. I was 
just a dumb kid who looked 
like an easy target, and he 
took advantage. I was a 
little shaken up after that, 
but nowhere near the magnitude I felt after being 
robbed at gunpoint. This time, I was at a swimming 
hole in the summer, somewhere you might expect 
safety, somewhere to escape to — not from. That 
sense of safety and community is all but shattered. 
Beyond the countless lives lost, this is what we give 
up — as a community, as a country — for guns. Never 
being safe, always looking over our shoulders, at the 
movies, at school, at church, at a bar, in your own 
home. Is it worth it?

I

’ve had enough,” I thought to 
myself at the end of my senior 
year of high school. I was tired of 
the small town in New Jersey and ready 
to get out. I was tired of being around 
the same people, I was tired of having 
no freedom and I was tired of the dull-
ness that came with being in the same 
place. 
I was ready for a change, and I knew 
I wanted to point myself toward Los 
Angeles. I could no longer stand the 
cold weather and snow. I wanted that 
temperate SoCal climate, the ability to 
go to the beach in the middle of Janu-
ary, the feeling of being on vacation all 
the time. Unfortunately, my mother 
wouldn’t let me apply to any schools in 
Los Angeles, so oblivious to how much 
the weather resembled the New Jersey 
winters, I went for the next farthest 
place: the University of Michigan. I 
knew that a lot of Californians went to 
Michigan, and they had an established 
alumni base there, so I could aim my 
sights on sunny LA post-grad. 
If I couldn’t go to California, I would 
go to the best school I go into far away 
from home. I would get the vaunted 
independence I desired and a degree 
that could land me on the Pacific shores.
I quickly fell from the clouds of my 
fantasy and back to cold reality. The 
minute I arrived at Michigan, I imme-
diately yearned for New Jersey. The 
cliche “You don’t know a good thing till 
it’s gone” definitely rang true for me. I 
didn’t realize how many things I took 
for granted at home — having a home-
cooked meal, having help with my laun-
dry, having a set bedtime and schedule 
to follow. I missed my mom’s meatballs, 
and the comfort of my own bed and 
bonding with my mom over our shared 
affinity for HGTV’s “House Hunters.” 
I missed my little town of Chatham — 
walking around the tree-lined streets, 
having delicious bagels at my favorite 
cafe, being an hour train ride from New 
York. I missed all the great attractions I 
took for granted while being able to go 
to the greatest city in the world nearly 
every weekend — the thin-sliced pizza, 
the Met, Central Park. 
I missed the familiarity of the people 
I had known for the past four years, 
and the strong friend group I had made 
my senior year. The independence I so 
desperately craved was too overwhelm-
ing for me. Without a rigid schedule, I 
spent too much time hanging out with 

friends, and not enough time studying, 
and often went to bed too late to be pro-
ductive in the morning. And, without 
that delicious Italian cooking, I ended 
up eating too little, and what I did eat 
was mostly garbage. I was a mess, and I 
couldn’t believe this was the start of the 
life I had waited for.
I also immediately put to rest all of 
those grand plans for California I had 
set out at the beginning of college. It 
was so nice to be able to be only a short 
plane ride away from home. I couldn’t 
imagine only being able to go home 
twice a year if I were in California, and 
not spend Thanksgiving in the comfort 
of my own community. More impor-
tantly, I couldn’t stand the fact of being 
too far from my sister, who moved to 
New York during my freshman year. I 
wanted to be able to see my parents and 
my sister more than just a few times a 
year. The nightly phone calls I made 
were no replacement — and this was 
coming from the guy who said he was 
only going to call home once a week. 
What really tipped the scales for 
me, though, was spending my 
summer with my sister in New 
York. I loved staying in her 
little 
studio 
apartment 
and being able to go to 
the attractions every 
weekend. Even better, 
I was able to walk or 
take public transpor-
tation 
anywhere, 
a near impossibil-
ity in car-centered 
California. I imme-
diately knew I had 
to return to the 
tri-state area; this 
was my home, and 
I could not imagine 
being away from the 
center of it all, with 
the people I loved 
most.
Putting those crazy 
ideas to rest also made 
my college experience 
better. I was able to estab-
lish a new friend group, 
go to the football games and 
share in all of the fun Friday 
nights after a long school week. I 
missed all of these important things 
in my rush to grow up. We became such 
a tight-knit group that we decided to 
travel to New York for spring break, 

and I was in charge of showing them 
my hometown. 
Returning home that February with 
my friends, my experience came full 
circle. I drove them around those same 
tree-lined streets, showed them what 
a real bagel tasted like, walked 
around the mall I had grown 
up with and, best of all, 
shared a dinner of my mom’s 
meatballs. Being able to share 
my love of home put any 
thoughts of leaving to rest.
