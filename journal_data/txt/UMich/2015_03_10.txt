CELEBRATING OUR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Next round of 
Canvas testing
 will include

 7,000 students 

By CARLY NOAH

Daily Staff Reporter

CTools may yield to a new 

online learning platform over the 
next few years, but current stu-
dents won’t likely be around for 
the transition.

Created by a consortium of 

institutions, including the Uni-
versity, CTools launched in 2004 
and has been in use since.

However, a new system, Can-

vas, has seen steady progress 
toward implementation since it 
was first piloted at the University 
in the fall of 2014.

The Senate Advisory Commit-

tee on University Affairs, along 
with working faculty groups, have 
spent the past year discussing the 
switch as part of the NextGen 
Michigan initiative, which seeks 
to modernize the University’s 

Information Technology Services.

A February report from the 

faculty 
team 
responsible 
for 

evaluating the switch, the Digital 
Innovation Advisory Group, cited 
changes in digital education as 
the main rationale for the switch.

“CTools 
development 
has 

unfolded around the creation of 
tools to manage digital assets in a 
reactive manner,” the report said. 
“Canvas, in contrast, has been 
conceived from the ground up to 
provide a more cohesive learning 
experience.”

In an interview last month, 

University Provost Martha Pol-
lack said the University so far has 
not yet made a formal decision on 
transitioning, but data from pilots 
has been promising.

However, she said she expects 

CTools to remain in use until 
April 2016 at the earliest.

This semester, the University 

is partaking in a second round of 
piloting with a larger audience. 
Pollack said the pilot includes a 
total of 123 instructors and 7,000 
students in 112 classes through-
out 15 schools and colleges.

Students also pose 

questions about 
diversity during 

fireside chat

By GENNIVEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel discussed controversy 
surrounding several Greek life 
ski trips during his monthly fire-

side chat Monday afternoon.

During the chat, Schlissel pre-

sented the roughly 30 students 
in attendance with a question of 
his own.

“A couple of the fraterni-

ties and sororities on the Janu-
ary break, the MLK weekend 
break, did some mayhem at some 
resorts they were staying at,” 
Schlissel said. “How do we set up 
a culture where there are ways to 
have a good time without being 
criminal?”

Engineering 
senior 
David 

Hershey said Central Student 
Government’s push for a student 
honor code could be one solution. 
The honor code would serve as 
an addition to the Statement on 
Student Rights and Responsibili-
ties, aiming to hold students to a 
higher standard of integrity and 
respect.

“The attempt behind it is 

to make it so that students are 
accountable to their fellow stu-
dents to some extent,” he said. 
“At some basic level we all want 
the face of the University to be a 

positive one because our future 
is based upon this university.”

Engineering sophomore Evan 

Field, president of Delta Kappa 
Epsilon, voiced his support for 
the sanctions recently placed on 
several fraternities and sororities, 
but said educational initiatives 
should be central to disciplinary 
processes going forward.

Schlissel agreed, but also 

stressed that concrete penalties 
become necessary at a certain 
point.

Test revision to 

start in April, reflect 

changing medical 
school preferences

By NABEEL CHOLLAMPAT

Daily Staff Reporter

Last 
month, 
registration 

opened for the new version of the 
Medical College Admission Test, 
better known as the MCAT.

The updated test, developed 

by the American Association 
of Medical Colleges, will focus 
more on experimentation and 
practicality. The AAMC will first 
administer the new test on April 
17. The old exam was last taken on 
Jan. 23.

According to the AAMC, the 

four updated 95-minute sections 
include Chemical and Physical 
Foundations of Biological Sys-
tems; Biological and Biochemical 
Foundations of Living Systems; 
Psychological, Social and Biologi-
cal Foundations of Behavior; and 
Critical Analysis and Reasoning 
Skills.

The test is expected to last 

about 7.5 hours — contrasting a 
previous three and a half time 
span. Testing time has increased 
due to the addition of a fourth 
section, as well as the longer 
length of each section compared 
to the previous exam. According 
to a January report in The New 
York Times, the additional test-

ing time necessitates more stam-
ina and focus.

Eric Chiu, Kaplan Test Prep’s 

executive director of pre-medical 
programs, said the changes will 
ultimately permit the exam to 
test application of material, for 
example, in an unprecedented 
way.

“The MCAT is undergoing not 

just a change in the content areas 
covered and the length of the 
exam, but also in terms of how 
it tests science content and, in 
particular, application and inte-
gration of that knowledge in a 
different way,” Chiu said.

He added that the new empha-

sis should aid students in their 
careers as doctors.

“It’s the type of skill pre-meds 

will need once they get to medi-
cal school,” Chiu said. “That’s 
how their medical school classes 
and, someday, how they will act 
as doctors really apply content 
knowledge from lots of different 
science areas to real-life scenari-
os.”

The changes include recom-

mendations that students take 
11 
semesters 
of 
prerequisite 

courses, compared to the previ-
ous eight. Sociology, psychology, 
biochemistry and statistics are 
now included in this list. The 
exam will also place more focus 
on chemistry and physics in the 
context of biological processes, 
which may require students to 
take additional coursework in 
that realm.

Multicultural Center Monday evening.

Trotter 

Multicultural 
Center hosts 

Abraham.In.Motion

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily Staff Reporter

A small group of students 

seated on the floor of Trotter 
Multicultural Center listened 
attentively Monday night as 
Jeremy Neal, a principle dancer 
from the critically acclaimed 
dance 
company 
Abraham.

In.Motion, introduced himself.

“My name is Jeremy and I 

identify as a queer artist, as a 
listener and as a friend,” he said 
to the group.

Neal led participants in the 

Dance and Identity Workshop, 
an event co-hosted by the Office 
of Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs 

and the Trotter Center.

First, Neal asked the group 

to consider how dance move-
ments can connect with one’s 
own identity, focusing the 
event on the ties between indi-
viduality and movement.

“Being able to understand 

your identity through move-
ment can make a better non-
verbal communicator, which is 
a very important skill to have,” 
Neal said.

During the dance workshop, 

Neal asked students to impro-
vise dance movements that cor-
responded with the spelling of 
their names. In another exer-
cise, the students took turns 
“sculpting” themselves using 
the body of their partner.

Kinesiology 
sophomore 

Kamaria 
Washington 
par-

ticipated in the dance work-
shop and said she thought the 
exercises were both fun and 
enlightening.

“I loved it,” Washington said. 

“It was a great way for me to 
freely dance, and it was amaz-
ing how Jeremy tied in how 
you identify yourself and how 
you want others to identify you 
with dance.”

Neal said he wanted the par-

ticipants to get comfortable 
with body parts they do not 
normally use.

“It was a combination of 

getting them to really think 
about moving their bodies in 
ways that hadn’t thought about 
before, and also it was way to 
get them to open up and explore 
different ideas,” he said.

Sophia Deery, a junior in 

both LSA and the School of 
Music, Theatre and Dance, 
who interned with Abraham.
In.Motion last summer and was 
a main organizer of the work-
shop, said the event was cre-
ated as a platform for members

Health System to 
collaborate with 
insurer to examine
medical practices

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

When actress Angelina Jolie 

opted for a preventative double 
mastectomy in 2013, the move 
spurred an increase in the num-
ber of people seeking genetic 
testing and counseling.

Now, the insurance provider 

Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michi-
gan and the University Health 
System have established a col-
laborative to improve and create 
more guidelines for genetic test-
ing, which can screen patients 
for genes linked to an array of 
illnesses and conditions.

The Genetic Testing Resource 

and Quality Consortium aims to 
investigate and improve current 
genetic testing practices.

David Share, senior vice presi-

dent of Value Partnerships at 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michi-
gan, said he believes genetic test-
ing will positively impact patient 
care in Michigan.

“Such testing has the potential 

to add great value to the care of 
people with conditions, or at risk 
for conditions, with a genetic 
component, which can affect 
their future health and also 
future treatment,” Share wrote

Fostering fitness at the ‘U’

RITA MORRIS/Daily

Gathering tournament held in the upstairs area of 
Get Your Game on Monday.

J UST LIKE M AGIC

Engineering 
senior 
Alli 

Johnson is the ambassador for the 
University’s chapter of Changing 
Health, Attitudes, and Actions to 
Recreate Girls, an organization 
that encourages fitness for college 
women by offering workout classes.

What is CHAARG?

It is basically a health and fit-

ness organization for women. 
We have a community and 
belongingness from working out 
together. In addition to regular 
workout classes, you actually 
get to know girls and find people 
that are interested in the same 
things about fitness as you are. 
It keeps you motivated toward 
your goals.

What is your role in 

CHAARG?

I’m the ambassador, which 

is basically the president of our 
Michigan chapter. I lead the orga-
nization at Michigan. I make sure 
everything is running smoothly, 
oversee the planning of events, 
help with any ideas… really get to 
know the members and work out 
outside of main events.

When and why did you join?

I joined in the fall of 2013, when 

it started at Michigan. I was an 
executive member then as well. 
I was the event coordinator — 
planning weekly events. I joined 
because I really have always loved 

fitness and living a healthy life-
style. I kind of missed that from 
my high school teams and defi-
nitely got off track in my fitness 
goals. I really like the community 
aspect of CHAARG, so when I 
heard about it I knew I wanted to 
join and be a leader, too.

What impact has CHAARG 

made in your life?

CHAARG has helped me meet 

many awesome people from 
around the nation. It is at 18 
universities now and I’ve gone 
to a few retreats with the other 
ambassadors and members from 
different chapters. It has been 
really cool to meet other leaders.

Five men in custody 

after death of 

opposition politician 

MOSCOW (AP) — Supporters of 

slain Russian opposition politician 
Boris Nemtsov dismissed sugges-
tions Monday that his shooting 
could have been motivated by 
Islamic extremism.

Five men are in custody in con-

nection with the Feb. 27 shoot-
ing, and all of them are from the 
predominantly Muslim region of 
Chechnya, or other parts of the 
restive north Caucasus.

Chechen leader Ramzan Kady-

rov has said one of the main sus-
pects, Zaur Dadaev, could have 
been motivated by Nemtsov’s com-
ments after the attack on French 
satirical 
publication 
Charlie 

Hebdo, which published cartoons 
of the Prophet Muhammad.

“Everyone who knows Zaur 

confirms that he is a deeply reli-
gious person who, like all Mus-

lims, was shocked by the actions 
of Charlie and comments (of those) 
who supported the publication of 
the caricatures,” Kadyrov said in a 
statement late Sunday.

In the Charlie Hebdo attack 

on Jan. 7 in Paris, 12 people were 
killed by two gunmen, who were 
later killed by police.

Nemtsov criticized the Charlie 

Hebdo attackers in an online post, 
saying that Islam was a “young 
religion that is current in its Mid-
dle Ages, and there is a long fight 
ahead to defeat the Islamic inqui-
sition.”

A long-time friend of Nemtsov 

and a fellow opposition activist, 
however, said he wasn’t an enemy 
of Islam.

“The attempt to convince the 

public that Nemtsov was an obvi-
ous target for Islamic radicals 
doesn’t stand up to criticism,” Ilya 
Yashin told the Associated Press 
on Monday.

“This version is extremely con-

venient for (President) Vladimir 
Putin, because it takes both him 

and his inner circle out of the line 
of fire.”

Five men, including Dadaev, 

have been detained in connection 
with Nemtsov’s killing. They all 
appeared in a Moscow court Sun-
day, where Dadaev and another 
suspect were charged in connec-
tion with shooting Nemtsov as he 
walked across a bridge near the 
Kremlin. The other three were 
jailed pending charges being filing.

One of the judges said Dadaev 

had acknowledged involvement, 
but Dadaev didn’t admit guilt in 
the courtroom, according to news 
agencies.

Footage from state channel 

NTV shows Dadaev turning to the 
camera and saying “I will say to 
you: I love the Prophet Muham-
mad.”

Dadaev had been an officer in 

the Chechen police troops, though 
Kadyrov said he had left the forces 
under unclear circumstances. The 
other suspect who was charged, 
Anzor Gubashev, denied being 
guilty.

Supporters of Nemtsov, howev-

er, believe that by casting blame on 
Islamic extremists, investigators 
are attempting to shift blame away 
from the government and onto a 
minority which remains contro-
versial among many Russians.

Chechnya suffered two intense 

wars over the past two decades 
between Russian forces and sepa-
ratist rebels increasingly under 
the sway of fundamentalist Islam. 
That reinforced the stereotype 
among many Russians of Chechens 
as violent extremists.

“The ‘Chechen trail’ appears 

to be more of a cover-up opera-
tion, and a clumsily executed one 
at that,” Vladimir Milov, another 
opposition activist, wrote Monday.

Opposition leaders bristled fur-

ther when Kadyrov was awarded 
the Order of Honor on Monday by 
the Kremlin, which is given in rec-
ognition of achievements in public 
life. Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokes-
man, told Russian news agencies 
in comments carried Monday that 
the award had been in the works 
several months, and the timing 
was a coincidence.

President calls for 
punishments during 

campus rally

NORMAN, Okla. (AP) — The 

president of the University of 
Oklahoma severed the school’s 
ties with a national fraternity on 
Monday and ordered that its on-
campus house be shuttered after 
several members took part in a 
racist chant caught on video.

President David Boren said 

he was sickened and couldn’t 
eat or sleep after learning about 
the video Sunday afternoon. The 
video, which was posted online, 
shows several people on a bus 
participating in a chant that 
included a racial slur, referenced 
lynching and indicated black stu-
dents would never be admitted 
to OU’s chapter of Sigma Alpha 
Epsilon.

The Oklahoma football team 

decided to protest rather than 
practice on Monday. At the team’s 
indoor practice facility, coach 
Bob Stoops led the way as players, 
joined by athletic director Joe 
Castiglione, walked arm-in-arm, 
wearing black. Meanwhile, a top 
high school recruit withdrew his 

commitment the university after 
seeing the video.

Boren attended a pre-dawn 

rally organized by students and 
lambasted the fraternity mem-
bers as “disgraceful” and called 
their behavior “reprehensible.” 
He said the university was look-
ing into a range of punishment, 
including expulsion.

“This is not who we are,” Boren 

said at a midday news conference. 
“I’d be glad if they left. I might 
even pay the bus fare for them.”

National leaders of Sigma 

Alpha Epsilon said late Sunday 
that its investigation confirmed 
members took part in the chant 
and announced it would close the 
local chapter. The national group 
said it was “embarrassed” by the 
“unacceptable and racist” behav-
ior.

White House Press Secretary 

Josh Earnest said the efforts by 
the university and the national 
fraternity to repudiate the racist 
comments were “an appropriate 
step.”

Boren said fraternity members 

have until midnight Tuesday to 
remove their belongings from 
the fraternity house. He said the 
fraternity was “not totally forth-
coming,” and he was still trying 

to find out who was on the bus so 
the school could consider disci-
plinary actions.

He said the university’s legal 

staff was exploring whether 
the students who initiated and 
encouraged the chant may have 
violated Title VI of the Civil 
Rights Act, which prohibits 
racial discrimination.

“We are also going to look at 

any individual perpetrators, par-
ticularly those that we think took 
a lead in this kind of activity,” 
Boren said.

It’s unclear who recorded the 

video, when it was recorded and 
who initially posted it online. 
Boren suggested it was likely 
taken by another student who 
didn’t agree with what was being 
chanted.

OU Unheard, a black student 

group on campus, posted a link to 
the video after someone anony-
mously called it to the group’s 
attention 
Sunday 
afternoon, 

communications director Alexis 
Hall said Monday.

“We immediately needed to 

share that with the OU student 
body,” said Hall, a junior. “For 
students to say they’re going to 
lynch an entire group of people. 
... It’s disgusting.”

Friends say Russian leader was 
not killed by Islamic extremists

formal recommendation.

“At the end of the winter 

semester, (DIAG) will make 
a recommendation about the 
scope and about the pace of 
moving forward,” Pollack said. 
“And then we’ll have more pilots 
over the summer.”

DIAG’s February report on 

the Fall 2014 pilot found that 
most users reported positive 
outcomes.

Among the 33 instructors 

and 3,000 students in the fall 
pilot, 75 percent of faculty and 
58 percent of students involved 
in the pilot preferred Canvas to 
CTools, according to the report.

One issue with larger classes, 

namely Statistics 250, was cited: 
the size of the class caused the sys-
tem to freeze, and in some cases, 
instructors were unable to upload 
grades for every student. How-
ever, the report concluded that the 
concern could be resolved.

Information Prof. Barry Fish-

man, DIAG co-chair, said there 
were several key distinctions 
between CTools and Canvas.

CTools runs through servers 

that are housed at the Univer-
sity. Canvas, on the other hand, 
lives in the cloud computing sys-
tem and is managed externally 
by a consortium of universities 
called Unizin, of which the Uni-
versity is a founding member.

Unizin is designed to create an 

open platform for universities to 
work together on furthering digi-
tal education initiatives and shar-
ing content — the first step being 
Canvas. Universities pay fees to 
keep the platform running.

“It’s sort of a priority shift 

for the institution I think — to 
say yes, we’re going to be in the 
business of great teaching and 
learning, supported by great 
technology, but not necessar-
ily in the business of keeping 

that technology running every 
day, which was the case with 
CTools,” Fishman said.

He added that when another 

group is managing a school’s 
learning environment and tech-
nology, an issue of ease versus 
control arises. Because of the 
collaborative nature of Unizin, 
this concern is less of an issue.

“When 
you’re 
purchasing 

services from someone else, you 
automatically have less control 
over that environment,” Fish-
man said. “That’s where Unizin 
comes in. So if we’re one cus-
tomer of infrastructure using 
Canvas, then we’re just one 
customer — and we’re a big cus-
tomer — but we’re not a majority 
customer.”

Pollack said through Unizin, 

and tools like Canvas, more col-
laboration is possible.

“Unizin was created in large 

part to be sure the universities 
lead and influence digital edu-
cation in the future,” she said. 
“(It’s) being created in such a 
way that we can use tools like 
Canvas, but with interfaces so 
we’d own the data and they 
pass through these interfaces to 
these other tools.”

She added that the choice to 

consider alternate options to 
CTools wasn’t motivated by fis-
cal reasons.

For faculty, Fishman said, 

there were several advantages to 
Canvas — namely, additional fea-
tures, such as SpeedGrader, which 
he said streamlined grading far 
beyond CTools’ capabilities.

“We look for seamlessness,” 

he said. “You want the differ-
ent pieces of the environment to 
feel like they were built to work 
together and that it’s easy for 
you to integrate various tools, 
and Canvas seems to support 
that as well.”

He added that there were also 

other possibilities beyond the 
direct features, such as the capa-
bility to partner with other Big 
Ten schools or other institutions 
around the nation to share data, 
or use Massive Open Online 
Courses.

However, not all students see 

the need for the updated learn-
ing platform.

LSA 
sophomore 
Krysten 

Dorfman said unless there is an 
advantage she has not found, 
CTools and Canvas are fairly 
similar.

“I never had any issues with 

CTools, so I don’t see any partic-
ular need for Canvas right now,” 
Dorfman said. “The design is 
cleaner and the interface is a lit-
tle more organized, but nothing 
noticeably special. It keeps all 
of our assignments in one place 
and lets us know when they are 
due, but so does CTools.”

Engineering 
junior 
Brian 

Esch said while the interface of 
Canvas is nicer, it doesn’t seem to 
do anything that CTools can’t do.

“The only thing that annoys 

me is having to switch between 
the two sites for all of my cours-
es,” Esch said. “I would prefer 
that one site would have all of 
my courses.”

So far, Fishman and Pollack 

said, the pilot processes have 
been smooth. However, both 
noted that there will be some 
transition concerns.

“One of the things I need to 

worry about in any transition 
is for faculty. If you invest in a 
lot of energy in building your 
course material on CTools, how 
could we make that transition 
from CTools to Canvas as easy 
as possible or completely auto-
matic,” he said.

Pollack said there were plans 

to aid faculty’s transition, should 
the switch occur, especially 
when it comes to moving mate-
rial stored on CTools to Canvas.

Overall, Fishman said a suc-

cessful transition requires that 
instructors make the most of 
any new platform.

“Learning management sys-

tems don’t lend themselves to 
feats of derring-do,” he said. 
“They’re the plumbing. Good 
teachers are doing the normally 
good things that they’re doing 
around here. Particularly excit-
ing teachers, I have seen no way 
in which Canvas is holding them 
back. It’s not about Canvas, it’s 
about what you do with it.”

RITA MORRIS/Daily

E. Royster Harper, vice president for Student Life, opens the floor for discussion at the March Fireside Chat with 
University President Mark Schlissel in the Michigan League on Monday.

DAVID SONG/Daily

Kinesiology sophomore Kamaria Washington practices actively internalizing her day during the Dance and Identity 
workshop at the Trotter Multicultural Center on Monday.

“I think everything we do 

here should be educational,” 
Schlissel said. “But, when you 
cross some kind of line to behav-
ior that I think would be char-
acterized as criminal behavior, 
then the balance between pun-
ishment and education changes 
a little bit. And I think that’s an 
important aspect of education, 
too.”

Schlissel said there has been 

discussion about delaying rush 
by at least one semester to allow 
students to form friendships 
outside of Greek life. However, 
the idea has been met with resis-
tance from those who say it will 
encourage more open parties 
during the first semester.

LSA sophomore Matt Fidel, 

The Team’s candidate for CSG 
vice president who attended the 
chat, said he thought the prob-
lem of students struggling to 
form a broad array of friendships 
stretches beyond Greek life.

“I think the problem here is 

that people come to campus and 
they immediately self-select, so 
it’s very easy to put the blame on 
Greek life and frats in general,” 
Fidel said. “But I think that, like 
you said, 80 percent of students 
aren’t in Greek life, but they still 
self-select.”

Fidel also presented questions 

to Schlissel about what student 
leaders could do to foster a more 
diverse campus.

“As student leaders what can 

we do to help increase minority 
enrollment?” Fidel said. “I know 
things like on-site admissions 
and pipeline programs get talk-
ed about a lot … I want to hear 
what your opinions on programs 
like that are.”

Though Schlissel acknowl-

edged that outreach programs 
are important, he said student 
leaders should focus on creating 
a more welcoming campus.

“What else can we do togeth-

er so that you can honestly say 
to a student from an underrep-
resented group, ‘Hey, you could 
fit in here, you could learn here, 
you could be respected here,’?” 
he said.

However, Schlissel said it is 

important for the University to 
reach out to in-state students 
who come from communities 
that do not see the University 
as accessible. He said he plans 
to visit high schools in places 
like Detroit, Grand Rapids and 
Kalamazoo to invite local stu-
dents to apply to the University.

“This is their university, this 

is the state of Michigan’s uni-
versity, and they should feel as 
much ownership and as much 
right to apply, and be considered 
and to come here as anybody 
else,” he said.

Several students voiced con-

cerns about the quality of life 
on North Campus, a complaint 
which Schlissel said he has dis-
cussed at nearly every fireside 
chat to date.

“The residential life is in the 

midst of a 10- or 15-year effort 
to really upgrade residential life, 
living and eating on campus,” he 
said. “The next frontier is the 
North Campus.”

Schlissel said the next meet-

ing of the University’s Board 
of Regents will devote time to 
focusing on how to improve resi-
dential life on North Campus.

“The ultimate goal is to make 

the North Campus as dense and 
vibrant as the Central Campus, 
and to have the businesses sur-
rounding North Campus sort of 
grow up in a way that living up 
there won’t require you to be 
down here to socialize,” he said.

E. Royster Harper, vice presi-

dent for student life, who also 
participated in the discussion, 
addressed the on-campus hous-
ing shortages that have plagued 
the University for several years 
due to large incoming freshman 
classes.

Harper said the renovations 

to residential communities on 
campus are part of the effort to 
alleviate the housing shortage 
problem.

The problem tends to affect 

upperclassmen who want to 
live on campus after their fresh-
man year. In recent years, many 
upperclassmen applying for on-
campus housing are given the 
Northwood apartments as their 
only residential option.

“The design is not to have 

anyone 
in 
Northwood 
that 

doesn’t want to be in Northwood 
because it doesn’t create the 
sense of community,” she said.

of the dance company to interact 
with a variety of students off the 
stage.

“We 
wanted 
Abraham.

In.Motion to be able to interact 
on a level that extends beyond 
the typical performance audi-
ence, which is usually comprised 
of only performing arts majors” 
she said. “We wanted to make 
sure the rest of the student body 
could also benefit from the com-

pany’s visit.”

She also said thinking care-

fully about one’s identity is a key 
element to success at college and 
in the years that follow.

“The University is fostering 

the next generation of leaders,” 
she said. “We call ourselves the 
Leaders and Best, and in order 
to be the best leaders, we need 
to have a strong sense of who we 
are.”

Neal also said understand-

ing your own identity is vital to 
understanding others.

“I don’t think you can real-

ly tell somebody else about 
themselves unless you know 
yourself,” he said. “If we take 
more time to look at ourselves 
and gain a clear understanding 
of our own ideas, we can then 
navigate the perspectives of 
others.”

Overall, Neal said he hopes 

participants left the event with a 
story to pass along to others.

“Even if they leave and share 

negative experiences with oth-
ers, bringing up these types of 
issues is important in building a 
better society,” he said.

Co-clinical 
directors 
David 

Keren, professor of pathology and 
director of the Division of Clinical 
Pathology, and Scott Owens, asso-
ciate professor of pathology and 
medical director of professional 
practice evaluation, worked with 
Blue Cross Blue Shield for approx-
imately 18 months to develop the 
program.

“We want to see how genetic 

tests are currently being conduct-
ed by physicians around the state 
of Michigan, how they compare 
with national guidelines around 
the state and working with hospi-
tals around the state,” Keren said.

The collaborative is one of 21 

Collaborative Quality Initiatives 
at the University that help teach 
hospitals and clinics how to pre-
vent complications and improve 
patient outcomes.

Blue Cross Blue Shield devel-

ops the CQIs to help hospitals 
save money and improve their 
surgical and testing procedures. 
Keren said he believes the pur-
pose of the CQIs is to respond to 
problems physicians might face 
around the state.

“The idea isn’t to tell the people 

of Michigan what to do but listen 
to what’s going on,” Keren said. 
“It is to sit together and listen to 
people across the state and cre-
ate guidelines. Then we look at 
outcomes to see if adherence to 
those guidelines actually makes a 
difference.”

Blue Cross Blue Shield con-

tacted the University Department 
of Pathology and collaborated to 
create the consortium. Owens 
said he believes the collabora-
tion lays the foundation for how 
people will continue to do genetic 
testing in Michigan.

“Ideally, it’ll benefit patients 

and make sure that the right 
tests are being done for the right 
patient at the right time,” Owens 
said. “Then once they get the test 
done, they can get the right fol-
low-up help for both themselves 
and their families.”

Keren and Owens traveled 

around Michigan to collect infor-
mation on how clinicians perform 
genetic testing. They inquired 
how often the physicians con-
ducted testing and how they 
would use the results. While their 
research found large discrepan-
cies from clinic to clinic, Keren 
said he hopes this initiative will 
help testing become more uni-
form throughout the state.

“The goal is to make it ratio-

nal so that everyone is following 
the same guidelines that have 
been established,” Keren said. 
“Hopefully it’ll rein in the costs 
of testing, and give opportunity to 
people to see what is the best way 
to help people clinically.”

The collaborative will start 

with the breast cancer associated 
BRCA gene testing, which detects 
mutations in breast cancer sus-
ceptibility genes. Owens said 
since the test is well-known and 
performed often, it will be a clear 
test of where discrepancies lie in 
the system.

“We’ll use BRCA to set up our 

process of gathering this infor-
mation,” he said. “The physician 
organizations and laboratories 
and so on that join the collabora-
tive will be the ones that together 
have meetings and decide how to 
move forward from there.”

Owens said the results will be 

used to improve the initiative for 
future gene testing.

“We’ll be looking at evidence 

with an eye to figure out if it tests 
exactly what we think its going 
to test, and then we’ll look at the 
clinical validity,” he said.

Physicians will then use this 

information to critically look at 
and develop new guidelines for 
genetic testing.

“We’re going to start with this 

test and ask: what is the current 
practice across the state?” Keren 
said. “We will work together with 
national organizations to create 
educational material to see if we 
can improve the practice across 
the state.”

After experimenting with the 

BRCA test, the collaborative will 
focus on other types of genetic 
testing.

“We’re going to be doing this 

with many different tests over the 
years,” Keren said. “What these 
hospitals are going to be doing 
that are working with us is sitting 
on our committees and deciding 
which tests we should be looking 
at. They help us decide how to 
create educational materials that 
would be appropriate for physi-
cians in hospitals or practices.”

Common Sense Action is a bipartisan 

political action group here at the University 
that is part of a national movement calling 
for generational fairness, fiscal responsibility 
in government, investment in millennial 
mobility and the renewal of prudent politics. 
The State of Michigan can encourage these 
qualities by reducing spending and increasing 
government efficiency.

One of the ways the Michigan government 

can promote fiscal responsibility is by 
supporting a change from a defined benefit 
to defined contribution pension system for 
state employees. A defined benefit pension 
program guarantees workers a pre-negotiated 
set of benefits, which are funded by a withheld 
portion of the employee’s salary that the 
government matches. The amount of these 
benefits is based on a defined percentage of the 
employee’s salary, which is then apportioned 
to the employee on a monthly basis for the 
rest of his or her life after retirement. The 
government and salary money from a defined 
benefit is placed in a public investment fund 
from which the pension is paid out.

The 
problem 
with 
defined 
benefit 

pensions plans is that they require actuarial 
accounting, which is essentially an estimate 
of the total cost of each of the employee’s 
pension plans based on how long they live and 
an estimate of how the public fund will do in 
the market. Because actuarial accounting is 
often inaccurate, the discrepancy between 
the estimate and the actual pension costs 
can be alarmingly significant, which has led 
to Michigan touting one of the highest debt 
totals in the United States. Michigan has a 
total state debt of more than $142 billion, or 
$14,435 per capita. A large portion of this debt, 
well more than half, is created by liabilities 
derived from unfunded pensions.

CSA opposes the culture of spending 

and passing the bills onto taxpayers in the 
future. We believe that this method of fiscal 
accounting is not only irresponsible but also 
unsustainable. This issue is important for 
millennials to understand because our current 
debt will be passed on to us in the future. 
We are calling for the current generation of 
politicians to act more prudently and to work 
together to solve our current problems rather 

than leaving them for our generation to bear. 
To do this, we need to increase our political 
involvement to persuade politicians that we 
matter and deserve to be represented.

We believe the solution to the pension 

problem is the conversion of the government’s 
pension system to a defined contribution 
pension system, which completely eliminates 
the need for actuarial accounting. In a defined 
contribution system, each employee is provided 
an entirely separate Investment Retirement 
Account into which the government and 
the employee agree to contribute a certain 
amount for later access. Implementing this 
debt-solvent program is important because it 
eliminates the need for actuarial estimates; 
thus millennials will not be responsible to pay 
for the difference between today’s estimates 
and the future’s realities. This means fewer 
tax dollars for our generation to pay after we 
enter the workforce.

Reducing excess pension costs of state 

employees is not the only action we propose 
the legislature should take to decrease the 
burden of unsustainable debt in Michigan. 
Common Sense Action supports the reduction 
of prison costs by reforming and reducing 
sentencing, probation and parole terms. The 
idea is to reduce prison sentences and costs 
while keeping offenders under the supervision 
of the state to ensure a smooth reintegration 
into society. While we believe the prison 
system is vital to keeping crime rates down, 
CSA supports reforming prison sentences to 
significantly reduce the total cost of the prison 
system to taxpayers. If Michigan doesn’t take 
this action now, millennials will end up paying 
for it in the future.

In 
recent 
years, 
though 
the 
prison 

population has decreased significantly, the 
costs of operating Michigan’s Department 
of Corrections have increased because of 
outstanding debt from defined benefit pension 
programs that were guaranteed by previous 
generations and are born by taxpayers today. 
From fiscal year 2007 to fiscal year 2015, the 
number of employed full-time corrections 
officers has decreased by nearly 20 percent, 
yet prison costs have continued to rise because 
of unfunded liabilities. CSA believes that 
this mistake should not be repeated today at

S

even steps to Spring Breaking 
under $700:

It’s the most annoying time 

of the year, thanks to Facebook. 
Spring technically 
doesn’t start until 
the 20th, and yet 
as we scroll down 
our news feeds, 
it’s clear that here 
at the University, 
vacation 
photo 

uploading 
sea-

son has officially 
begun.

Some 
Wol-

verines can call 
mom and pops and request a $3,000 
transfer for the occasion. What’s 
$3,000 for an all-inclusive vaca-
tion in paradise when you spend 
$100,000 on the damages alone? 
But for most of us living on earth, 
vacationing is a luxury, not a right. 
It is possible to Spring Break Big 
Ten style on a reasonable budget, 
and here are some tips to help you 
do it.

1. Save and book early
If you want to Spring Break 

savvy, it’s crucial to start saving 
early and to book as soon as pos-
sible. Right now, round-trip flights 
from Detroit to Miami are going for 
around $500. Back in October, the 
same flights were $187.

I don’t know about you, but I 

don’t remember the last time I had 
an expendable $700 lying around in 
my bank account, especially during 
the school year working part time.

Your best bet is to put away a 

little bit every week while you’re 
working in the summer. If you’re a 
freshman, put away $5 every week 
into a savings account, and by your 
senior year, you won’t regret skip-
ping that weekly drunken late-
night trip to South U Pizza.

2. Check out a cruise
Cruises are generally a good 

value because they take you to dif-
ferent destinations while feeding 
and entertaining you for free. Four-
day cruises are often advertised 
for $230 or so, but don’t be fooled. 
Before you check out online, Car-
nival is going to add taxes, fees and 

gratuity totaling an extra $100 or 
so. Once you board the ship, they’re 
going to add an extra $50 for taxes, 
or something. I’m not really sure. I 
was way too excited to complain to 
anyone about this.

Also, don’t forget to return those 

beach towels. Lose it and pay $22.

Anyways, $380 is a pretty good 

deal for four days of all-inclusive 
food, a trip to Key West and Cozu-
mel. My friends and I had the time 
of our lives, even though the food 
was questionable.

3. Use Google Maps
If you’re staying at a hotel, loca-

tion is everything. Use Google 
Maps to find something cheap and 
close to the beach or your destina-
tion. If you’re doing Spring Break 
right, you’re not going to be spend-
ing much time in the room other 
than to sleep, shower or recover 
temporarily from a sunburn.

If you’re going to Miami, do 

South Beach, but don’t stay on 
Ocean Drive. It will cost half as 
much to stay on Washington or 
Collins, literally a three-minute 
walk in the sun to the beach. If you 
use Expedia, Priceline or Kayak, 
you could find a room to share with 
your friends for $50 per person per 
night. The more the merrier (and 
the cheaper).

4. Bring a flask
Unfortunately for us millen-

nial ladies, chivalry at most bars 
is either hanging on by a thread 
or dead. Instead of “Can I buy 
you a drink?” we’re lucky if we’re 
asked for a “dance.” From a cost-
benefit standpoint, I’m starting to 
 

understand why.

At bars on South Beach, tee-

ny-tiny mixed drinks are $8, not 
including a tip, and as a former 
waitress, I’m obligated to add that 
a tip is not optional. A bottle of nice 
clear liquor for you and your ladies 
at the party store around the corner 
is about $25. You do the math. It’s 
not trashy, it’s economical.

5. Bring cash (and small bills)
When you’re on vacation, it’s 

essential to bring cash with you. If 
you’re splitting a cab with friends, 
the driver isn’t going to split the 

bill among four credit cards. Res-
taurants on South Beach are the 
same way. At your hotel, you should 
always bring singles to tip house-
keeping and the guys that help with 
your luggage. Michigan’s reputa-
tion isn’t worth stiffing waiters 
or bartenders.

Similarly, if you’re in a foreign 

country, especially Mexico, and 
all you have is a credit card, often-
times businesses won’t accept it. If 
they do, you’re going to be charged 
a 20-percent processing fee for 
everything you buy. If you only 
bring $50 bills, you’re going to get 
ripped off.

6. Bring a Spanish-speaking 

friend

If you go anywhere in southern 

Florida, the Bahamas or Mexico, 
many of the natives are going to 
speak Spanish as their first lan-
guage. Nothing says “I’m a rich 
American with $200 in my pocket” 
quite like buying something at face 
value in English. My roommate 
Danielle, a fluent Spanish speaker, 
talked a shop owner in Mexico 
down to $5 from $17 for person-
alized threaded bracelets. It was 
incredibly entertaining and quite 
the asset. Without her, the tan on 
my wrist would be generic and 
unremarkable right now.

7. Turn on Airplane mode
We’re millennials, and yes, many 

of us are emotionally attached to 
our phones. Spring Break is the per-
fect time to cut the cord. If you’re 
on vacation outside of the United 
States, roaming out of country 
could cost you $2.50 per minute.

No matter where you go, take 

pictures for the memories, but 
remember that every minute you 
spend checking Instagram, Face-
book and Snapchat is a minute you 
can’t spend fully enjoying the sun 
and the environment. I’ll tell you 
right now that the Yik Yak game is 
weak in Miami and Key West any-
ways. Sit back, relax and enjoy. In a 
few days, you’ll be back to parkas, 
snow boots and exams.

millennials’ cost in the future.

Common 
Sense 
Action 
also 

supports a change in the philosophy 
of our state government’s policy 
implementation 
and 
spending 

initiatives 
through 
priority-based 

budgeting. Priority-based budgeting 
is the idea that lawmakers and 
bureaucrats work together as one 
entity to focus on the outcomes of 
policy rather than implementing 
idealistic 
yet 
ineffective 
and 

inefficient legislation. Priority-based 

budgeting 
can 
reduce 
spending 

and debt while still accomplishing 
the most essential and beneficial 
functions of state government.

Another facet of priority-based 

budgeting that CSA supports is 
performance 
evaluation. 
Through 

evaluating what works and what 
doesn’t in our bureaucratic functions, 
Michigan can make its governmental 
programs more efficient and less 
costly to Michigan taxpayers. As 
millennials, we need to encourage our 

government to operate in a fiscally 
responsible way so we can change 
our current culture of ineffective, 
exorbitant spending.

While CSA values the functions 

of our state government, we believe 
that it is imperative that we reduce 
our state debt to a more sustainable, 
efficient level that will not be a 
burden to our wallets in the future.

I

’m writing this on Sunday, March 8, and I 
am cranky for a handful of reasons, some of 
which are actually relevant. I’m upset that 

I’m on my last day of a Spring 
Break that felt far too short. 
I’m also upset that I some-
how managed to sleep until 
10:30 a.m. without feeling 
particularly rested. When I 
voiced this frustration to my 
mother, she laughed. “Well 
yeah,” she said, “because it 
feels like 9:30.”

Ah. Daylight saving time. 

Winding the clocks for-
ward is an annual source of 
annoyance for me, one that does not get eas-
ier with experience. The older I get, the less 
sense it makes. Why am I subjecting myself to 
an hour less of sleep? Why do I want to spend 
a week readjusting my sleep schedule to fit 
the change? Why do I want to wake up in the 
dark when it’s hard enough to wake up when 
there’s light outside? (And how do I change 
the time on my microwave?)

It has something to do with farmers. At least 

that’s what everyone seems to think.

The “it was started by farmers” thing is a 

very strange collective delusion, particularly 
because farmers are the only group to have 
ever organized a lobby against daylight saving 
time. It gives them fewer daylight hours in the 
morning to get crops to market. Cows appar-
ently don’t adjust well to earlier milking sched-
ules either.

Daylight saving time is a practice that has 

nothing to do with farmers and everything 
to do with war. The first country to use DST 
was Germany during World War I. This was 
an effort to reduce the use of artificial light 
to conserve energy for the war. The United 
States followed suit two years later. The prac-
tice was abandoned post-war and reinstated 
during World War II, during which DST was 
referred to as “War Time.”

And so daylight saving time was created 

in an effort to conserve energy. As much as I 

would like to accuse DST of being an immedi-
ate failure, I’m forced to admit that it actually 
worked — at first. DST saved the day during 
the 1973 oil embargo saving 10,000 barrels 
of oil every day. But, this was before air con-
ditioning was an essential fixture in most 
American homes.

Today, that extra hour of daylight in the 

summer translates into a hotter hour of 
increased air conditioning use. The National 
Bureau of Economic Research found in 2008 
that because of this increase in air condition-
ing, the energy saved by less artificial lighting 
is completely canceled. We actually use more 
energy because of air conditioning costs dur-
ing daylight saving time.

So who’s winning when we turn our clocks 

forward an hour every year? It’s certainly 
not television networks, which dislike DST 
because people tend to start watching their 
shows after the sun sets. When the sun sets 
later, they lose viewers to outdoor activities. 
It is logical that outdoor industries would be 
the winners of daylight saving time, but it still 
seems weird to me that the biggest champions 
are — wait for it — golf courses. Yes, we are sub-
jecting ourselves to the hassles of clock chang-
ing and tiredness for golf people who have a lot 
to gain from increased hours of operation. It is 
a $70 billion industry in the United States, and 
although this is no small sum, I can’t help but 
feel angry that I’m losing an hour of my Spring 
Break for such a boring sport.

Ultimately, daylight saving time doesn’t 

save energy, but it might still promote eco-
nomic growth. America has a history of 
instating and repealing DST, but for now it’s 
here to stay. Regardless, I think I’m with the 
cows on this one: I don’t like adjusting my 
sleep schedule, waking up in the dark for 
what feels like no reason. As irritated as I am, 
however, I’m not quite ready to join the farm-
ers’ lobby against daylight saving time. Prob-
ably because I’m too tired.

Meatless Mondays 

 TO THE DAILY:

I am writing to express my sup-

port for East Quad Residence 
Hall’s Meatless Monday event and 
encourage it and other campus din-
ing facilities to make every Monday 
a Meatless Monday. Oftentimes, 
people’s first impression of the 
vegan lifestyle is one of repulsion. 
However, vegan food can be far 

more decadent and delicious than 
it is given credit for. What many 
fail to realize is that anything — 
from ribs to omelets to ice cream 
— can be made vegan. In addition, 
the benefits of the vegan lifestyle 
for the animals, environment and 
one’s health are too significant to 
ignore. Despite this, the apprehen-
sion of changing their diet and leav-
ing behind their favorite foods often 
hold people back.

That’s why Meatless Mondays are 

a great step. This program gives meat 
eaters the opportunity to discover 

new vegan and vegetarian foods in 
a relaxed and experimental atmo-
sphere. As a campus, we have enor-
mous potential to preserve resources 
and save lives by simply eating vegan 
or vegetarian meals one day per 
week. I hope that by taking part in 
Meatless Mondays, students can 
become more open-minded to giving 
the vegan lifestyle a try.

‘House of Cards’ 
takes a tumble

Third season of 
Netflix original 

disappoints

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

This article contains spoilers 

from the third season of Netflix’s 
“House of Cards.”

“The 
Presi-

dency 
is 
the 

illusion 
of 

choice,” Frank 
Underwood 
(Kevin Spacey, 
“American 
Beauty”) muses 
late into season 
three of Netf-
lix’s “House of Cards.” Over the 
first two seasons, Frank fought, 
lied and killed to become the 
leader of the free world. Now, in 
season three, he finds the posi-
tion he sought might not have all 
the power he hoped for.

In the visually dark and unsat-

urated world of “House of Cards,” 
Frank works best in the shadows, 
but now, the harsh spotlight is 
on him. With his approval rating 
sinking, he is a character far more 
desperate than the cold, calculat-
ing schemer seen in the first two 
seasons. Spacey still delivers the 
cruel bravado of a Shakespearean 
villain even as Frank fights for a 
flatlining political life. Beset by 
attacks from both parties, Frank 
tells Stephen Colbert (playing 
his alter-ego from “The Colbert 
Report”), “Both parties want 
the same thing,” to which Col-
bert replies, “A new president in 
2016.” 

Frank is no longer able to exe-

cute the well-laid plans from pre-
vious seasons. Instead, he grasps 
at straws in a desperate attempt 
to survive, and fails more often 
than he succeeds. While this 
brings some humility to the char-
acter, it does cause the momen-
tum of the season to break up, 
and is not nearly satisfying as 
Frank’s rise to power. The strug-
gle to succeed places character 
development before moving the 
plot forward with mixed results.

The impeachment of Presi-

dent Walker (Michael Gill, “Per-
son of Interest”) last season has 
blown a powder keg in D.C., and 
both sides are rushing for power 
among the wreckage. The first 
episodes of the season lay this 
landscape out well with different 
characters set up to challenge or 
work with Frank, but the series 
fails to capitalize on the poten-
tial. The worst failing is when 
Hector Mendoza (Benito Marti-
nez, “The Shield”), a promising 
Republican candidate, is abruptly 
written out halfway through the 
season’s run.

Other 
primary 
characters 

struggle to make a mark this sea-
son. Notably, Heather Dunbar 
(Elizabeth Marvel, “Law & Order: 
SVU”), Frank’s rival for the 2016 
Democratic bid, begins to sink 
into the shadowy morality Frank 
occupies until the man she hates 
says, “You’re finally one of us.” 
Dunbar is interesting because she 
is unaware of her growing hypoc-
risy, caught up in her delusions 
of idealism. But like many story-
lines this season, her relevance is 
inconsistent. She is important one 
moment, takes a backseat the next 
and then comes to the forefront in 
fits and starts.

After being nearly beaten to 

death by Rachel Posner (Rachel 
Brosnahan, “Manhattan”), Doug 
Stamper’s (Michael Kelly, “Person 
of Interest”) survival and recovery 
brought forth the most engaging 
subplot in season three. Physically 
and mentally broken, Doug has to 
come to grips with his reality. He’s 
a wounded animal put out to pas-
ture by Frank, except Doug’s not 
ready to quit. The character has an 
addictive personality, and for years 
has filled his life serving Frank. 
Now that what defines him is gone, 
Doug spirals into self-destruction 
as he relapses into alcohol addic-
tion and obsesses over finding 
Rachel. But he contains an unstop-
pable resilience, even in his lowest 
state, when he drunkenly declares 
to Frank, “I’m not Peter Russo; I 
won’t go like he did.”

One of “House of Cards” ’s big-

gest weaknesses following its stel-
lar first season is the absence of 
Russo (Corey Stoll, “The Strain”). 
Stoll brought forth a man try-
ing to get his life right in order to 
be a better father for his children 
and partner for his girlfriend. His 
relationships and promise made 
his orchestrated demise by Frank 
the series’ greatest tragedy, and 
the show has struggled to create a 
worthy followup.

Doug’s storyline in season three, 

while overextended and taken 
slightly too far near the end, is the 
closest “House of Cards” has come 
to equaling Russo’s conflict. Kelly 
captures a man in flux, desperately 
trying to claw his way back into 
the world he’s been cast out of. His 
attempts to stabilize also bring 
genuine, humanizing moments to 

a stoic character as Doug recon-
nects with his brother and his fam-
ily. But Doug is disturbed man by 
nature, and in his final arc in the 
last three episodes, he cements his 
dark path beside Frank.

As Doug tries to fall back within 

Frank’s good graces, the series’ 
second lead, Claire Underwood 
(Robin Wright, “The Princess 
Bride”) slowly begins distanc-
ing herself from Frank. Frank 
and Claire realize the integral 
role each has played in their rise, 
but what bound the two together 
soon becomes a problem for the 
pair. Visually striking motifs such 
as eggs and Buddhist sand art 
emphasize the fragile state of their 
union as Claire tells author Tom 
Yates (Paul Sparks, “Boardwalk 
Empire), “I hate how much I need 
us.”

Frank and Claire’s partner-

ship is meant to be equal, but it 
becomes more apparent through-
out the season that the end result 
is anything but that. Claire may 
be just as tactile as Frank but she 
possesses the flaw of humanity. 
It’s what makes Claire see the 
pair as “murderers” while Frank 
says, “We’re survivors.” It’s these 
emotions of empathy that hold 
Claire back from achieving what 
the brutal Frank has gained. 
Claire has sacrificed so much 
to put Frank in power so she 
would one day find herself at the 
top. Sadly, she sees that because 
of her smallest hint of decency, 
she will never gain her end goal. 
Meanwhile, Frank refuses to see 
or acknowledge this. In the final 
episode, all this comes to head in 
a battle of wills inside the Oval 
Office.

The focus on character devel-

opment sets up many of the series’ 
main characters for promising 
arcs in season four. But it still 
feels like setup. After 13 new epi-
sodes, “House of Cards” season 
three did not made great strides. 
The acting by Spacey, Wright and 
Kelly, complemented by fantas-
tic, dark cinematography, carry 
the season. However, the nar-
rative feels stretched too thin, 
unable to fully deliver on several 
promising setups. Instead, it’s 
left waiting for another season to 
pick up the pieces.

Why we need a space 
for female writers 

COMMUNITY CULTURE COLUMN

A

s a native of Metro Detroit, 
it’s not uncommon for 
me to return home a few 

times a semester to enjoy some 
R&R and catch 
a break from 
the fast-paced 
University life. 
On one of these 
returns a few 
months ago, I 
stopped by an 
exhibit at our 
local science 
museum, which 
featured a col-
lection of National Geographic 
photographs all shot by women. 
Aptly titled “Women of Vision,” 
the exhibit was moving, poignant 
and empowering, but I have to 
admit I didn’t think deeply about 
it until I received the hardcover 
collection as a gift this past week. 
Flipping through the glossy 
pages of striking photographs, it 
became apparent to me just how 
important it was to have a space 
that recognizes not just good pho-
tographers, but fantastic women 
artists. 

We hear cries for gender equal-

ity in politics, we try (unsuccess-
fully) to pass legislation to close 
the wage gap, but there’s a quieter 
movement for equal recognition in 
fields of art. For many years, art has 
been a place to foster social move-
ments, including gender equal-
ity, and while there’s certainly a 

space for women in artistic fields, 
there remains a discrepancy in 
how women artists are recognized 
professionally. Of the 11 photog-
raphers highlighted in “Women 
of Vision,” several make mention 
of how difficult it was to be taken 
seriously in their field profession-
ally, due to gender and not skill. 
One photographer even quoted a 
male colleague’s reaction to her job 
placement: “A girl! I’m not working 
with a girl. She’ll never be able to 
carry my equipment.”

Of course, there are exceptional 

artists, in this case photographers, 
of every gender identity, and tal-
ent should be celebrated without 
dependence to this categorization. 
However, I’ve noticed that females 
often have a skilled eye for reading 
people, a skill that translates well 
through artistic mediums.

Maybe it’s due to nature or 

nurture, two X chromosomes 
or 
something 
else 
biological, 

but when I look at the photos in 
“Women of Vision,” I see individu-
al captures of humanity that really 
encourage emotional response. 
My reactions are not black and 
white, but rather a kaleidoscope 
of emotions, much like the human 
experience itself. Sure, there are 
photos of landscapes, lions stalk-
ing prey in the Kalahari Desert, a 
moonrise behind Mount St. Hel-
ens and cherry blossoms in Kyoto, 
but the majority of the photos are 
focused on raw, unfiltered human-

ity, which is not always easy to look 
at: A Nepali child bride crying out 
in anguish as she’s forcibly taken 
to her husband’s village; unsettling 
polygamous, Mormon families in 
Utah; a Swedish reindeer herder 
mourning the loss of two of his 
herd in the snow. 

It’s this ability to capture 

moments so deeply human and the 
power to illicit a range of emotions 
that not only cements photography 
as art, but also encourages further 
recognition of women as artists. 
And the ability to bring to light 
political and human rights issues 
in the world through the lens of a 
camera is a skill that starts with 
the artist’s own eye for artistry. 

Just a few weeks ago I found 

myself at a Zine release party, cel-
ebrating 52 glossy pages of poems, 
photographs and designs, all cre-
ated by women artists and many 
from the University. It was truly 
inspiring to see such a large turn-
out for the event, including both 
women and men, all gathered to 
celebrate female artists. Even if 
this sparked desire for women-
curated art begins in progressive 
cities like Ann Arbor, I’ll bet that 
the fire will spread to the rest of 
the world. There just needs to be 
artists encouraged to light the 
match.

The king of spring made his way 

through Suntan City, where just a 
sip turned into taking his drunk ass 
home, and now 
he’s packing up 
his ol’ Bronco 
and checkin’ out. 
Luke Bryan had 
a long run with 
his spring break 
EP series and at 
38 years old, the 
country 
super-

star decided to 
call it quits — 
but not before 
releasing 
one 

last record, Spring Break: Checkin’ 
Out, which includes five new tracks 
in combination with his previous 
six-track EP, Spring Break 6 … Like 
We Ain’t Ever.

Bryan knows the ingredients to 

a well-balanced vacay breakfast: 
sand, spring flings and sippin’. The 
record encompasses all the singer’s 
usual substances for the series — 
the mind “games” played out at a 

hot-and-cold bar scene, the linger-
ing visions of “you and the beach” 
and the gal you wish you’d met 
on “night one” of your weeklong 
spring adventure. That’s enough to 
qualify as a Panama Beach nutri-
tionist, right?

On the flip side, if there’s a spe-

cial somebody that you should’ve 
told off on day one, do yourself 
a kindness and find “The Sand I 
Brought to the Beach.” Don’t make 
the same mistake twice, in case 
you missed this free-spirit rocker 
from Spring Break 6… Like We Ain’t 
Ever.

Most of Bryan’s five new songs 

are tailored to the singer’s exit 
strategy (or “checkin’ out” strat-
egy, rather) and leave listeners 
with a reminder that “You and the 
Beach” are a lingering sensation, 
post-departure.

“I was a fool to think I could 

just move on/Because you and the 
beach followed me home.”

But “the sand runs out” offi-

cially on Bryan’s “Spring Break-
down” — a tearjerking roundup 
of the memories made between 
the country star and his longtime 

spring break followers. 

“I’ve watched this crowd grow 

… I remember when we started 
this week-long party/And to think 
that it’s over/It makes me wanna 
spring breakdown.”

The saga began with the 2009 

debut of Spring Break With All 
My Friends, and fans’ heartbro-
ken feelings began swelling upon 
hearing about their party pal’s 
entertainment exit from Panama 
City. The reminiscing words of 
the track are just enough to push 
beach-goers into their own spring 
breakdown.

“Next year I’ll go through pic-

tures/Wishing I was down there 
with ya, hanging out/It’ll kill me 
then, but I’m here right now.”

It’s a sad day indeed when the 

man, the myth, the legend, Luke 
Bryan, has to come to terms with 
his own age — something that’s 
been a recent talking point for the 
“Crash My Party” singer. For the 
time being, however, the spunky 
country star still has the beach 
flare to carry tunes that know no 
age-bounds. Thirty-eight is just a 
number, after all.

‘Murder’ butchers 
its narrative potential

By ALEC STERN

Daily Arts Writer

This review contains spoilers 

from the season finale of “How to 
Get Away with Murder.”

“How 
to 

Get Away with 
Murder” 
had 

an immensely 
successful first 
season. As the 
newest 
addi-

tion to Shon-
daland and the 
lead-out to the 
newly dubbed 
“TGIT” 
line-

up, “Murder” was undoubtedly 
this fall’s most talked about new 
drama. “ ‘How To Get Away With 
Murder’ Exposes Just How Dan-
gerous Gender Stereotypes Can 
Be,” wrote The Huffington Post 
earlier this year. A controver-
sial September New York Times 
article asserted that the series 
should really be called “How to 
Get Away with Being an Angry 
Black Woman.” In one of my own 
columns, I praised “Murder” for 
its commitment to breaking down 
stereotypes of any kind, calling it 
one of the highs of network pre-
miere week. But if “Murder” has 
taught me anything, it’s that talk-
ing about a show — or praising it 
in specific ways — isn’t mutually 
exclusive from the quality of its 
narrative. In other words, “How to 
Get Away with Murder” the series 
is very different from “How to Get 
Away with Murder” the spectacle. 

If you take away the think-

pieces, the controversy and the 
penises on dead girls’ phones, 
what are you really left with? A 
“Damages”-inspired legal thriller 
that’s not nearly as great as, well, 
“Damages.” A twisty soap opera 
not nearly as fun as “Scandal.” An 
ensemble drama with only a few 
integral cast members. Despite its 
many triumphs, it was always, if 
anything, “How to Get Away with 
Murder” the series that fell short, 
and the two-hour season finale 
was no exception.

Throughout its entire first 

season, “How to Get Away with 
Murder” ’s biggest issue was its 
repetitiveness — not just with its 
obvious visual motifs or flashback 
to the murder night (though I’d be 
ok to never see another cheerlead-
er twirl or coin toss ever again), but 
dramatically as well. Who killed 
Lila? What was Sam’s involve-

ment? Can Annalise be trusted? 
How does Asher fit in? Will the 
Keating Five fold under the pres-
sure? And in its closing moments, 
“Murder” ’s big reveal didn’t seem 
to forge a new journey for the 
characters, but rather rehash the 
same ideas. In fact, “Murder” ’s 
finale brought us right back to the 
very beginning. 

The sight of Rebecca’s dead 

body, eyes open, lying under 
the stairs might have been a big 
enough twist to satiate “Murder” 
’s dedicated fan base, but beyond 
its high shock value, the Rebecca 
whodunit almost assures that 
“Murder” ’s second season will 
hit all the same notes as its first 
— just change the names and the 
scenery and you’ve got season 
two. Who killed Rebecca? What 
was Frank’s involvement? Can 
Annalise be trusted? How does 
Asher fit in? Will the Keating Five 
fold under the pressure? 

Admittedly, I might be mak-

ing a lot of assumptions about the 
second season already, which is 
yet to even film, let alone air. But 
season finales aren’t only about 
wrapping up the current sto-
rylines. Even more importantly, a 
finale must convince its audience 
to come back after a long summer 
hiatus — seven months in “Mur-
der” ’s case. Perhaps in that time, 
I’ll grow more accustomed to the 
idea of yet another murder to get 
away with. But for now, the sight 
of dead Rebecca was less exciting 
than it was exhausting — more of 
a here we go again. 

That’s not to say there weren’t 

bright spots in “Murder” ’s two-
hour finale. Most significantly, 
we finally did get to see exactly 
who killed Lila, as most of the 
first hour took place on the night 
of her murder. In the end, it was 
Frank, the mysterious not-a-law-
yer/hit-man, who strangled Lila 
on the roof of the sorority house. 

Though the biggest mystery of all 
is how two grown men made it to 
the roof of a sorority house on one 
of the busiest nights of the year 
without being noticed. Regard-
less, in another satisfying twist, 
Lila’s murder was under Sam’s 
orders, not Annalise’s, teasing 
an interesting backstory to come 
between the two men in Annal-
ise’s life. And even in such a busy 
episode, the finale’s first hour 
managed to shoehorn in a case-of-
the-week. Like in “Scandal,” the 
more episodic elements of “Mur-
der” defuse the high energy and 
tension, and the finale’s unique 
priestly murder case did just that. 

“How to Get Away with Mur-

der” ’s first season was a success 
by any measure. Despite two 
previous Academy Award nomi-
nations under Viola Davis’s 
belt, “Murder” finally put the 
deserving actress on the map. It 
showcased different faces and 
voices, and it has become the 
foremost talked-about series 
when it comes to diversity. It 
broke down stereotypes and 
barriers for women and por-
trayed both its straight and 
gay characters with refreshing 
realism. But most often, and 
arguably even more important-
ly, what got lost in the shuffle 
was its narrative. 

“How to Get Away with 

Murder” — best in spectacle, 
not in show.

ALBUM REVIEW
Madonna embraces 
her ‘Rebel Heart’

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

Madonna’s newest LP, Rebel 

Heart is a monster. It consists 
of 14 songs, five iTunes bonus 
tracks and six 
more 
bonus 

tracks 
on 

the 
physical 

CD. That is 
25 
songs, 

compromising 
a 
90-plus-

minute 
experience 
loaded 
with 

some serious beats, five-star 
collaborations, a lot of “bitches” 
and 
an 
auto-tuned 
infant. 

Much like the hearts of mere 
mortals, Madonna’s newest LP, 
Rebel Heart has four distinct 
chambers that keep it beating: 
the cocky, the boring, the filthy 
and the impassioned.

This is Madonna’s 13th (yes, 

13th) studio album. At this point 
she has proved herself over and 
over again, and has the right 
to a song such as “Bitch I’m 
Madonna.” The beat mixes hip-
hop, funk and EDM and knows 
exactly when to drop and when 
to let off. This track also features 
another mystifying Nicki Minaj 
cameo 
(follow-up 
to 
2012’s 

“ Give Me All Your Luvin’”). 
Madge furthers her confidence 
streak on “Unapologetic Bitch,” 
“Iconic” and “Veni Vidi Vici.” 
“Unapologetic 
Bitch” 
mixes 

fighting words with a bohemian 
beat; it’s certainly an odd mix, 
but the rolling bongos dull the 
edge of otherwise in-your-face 
lyrics. To bring “Iconic” and 
“Veni Vidi Vici” to the next level, 
she enlists the help of Chance 
the Rapper and Mike Tyson on 
the former and Nas on the latter. 
Tyson opens with “I’m the best 
the world has ever seen … ” 
before Madonna comes in with 
an OK chorus. “I-can. I-con. 
Two letters apart” is clever, but 
in reality the lines don’t come 
off as natural. This track finds 
its footing in the echoes that 
follow of “iconic” and “ironic.” 
“Veni Vidi Vici” (Latin for “I 
came. I saw. I conquered”) 
recounts her career. She deems 
herself fearless and provocative 
— cheers to you, Madge. Nas 
echoes her sentiments with his 
own story; his verse is good and 
leads back to the chorus with 
some well-placed gunfire, but 
overall it’s distracting.

Madonna certainly has a lot to 

say about herself, but a handful 
of Rebel Heart tracks come out 
way beneath her. “Hold Tight,” 

a drum-backed love song, seems 
to echo sentiments of other 
tracks in a repetitive monotone. 
The two final tracks on the 
basic album package, “Inside 
Out” and “Wash All Over Me,” 
are forgettable as well. These 
tracks are honestly boring. The 
choruses don’t invite a listener 
to join in, nor do they present 
something worth listening to 
without that catch. “Autotune 
Baby” is frustrating to say the 
least. The infant wailing in the 
background offers no twist, 
just simple annoyance, similar 
to that of a baby crying. These, 
as well as bonus-bonus tracks 
“Beautiful Scars” and “Queen,” 
are 
the 
slumps 
among 
an 

otherwise uplifting, reflective 
and tantalizing album.

As 
seen 
by 
Madonna’s 

Givenchy-sponsored ass flash at 
the Grammys, she isn’t afraid of 
getting down n’ dirty. The first 
somewhat-risqué track, “Body 
Shop,” is a mess of innuendo. 
Clapping and a single drum back 
a mixed metaphor of doing the 
dirty/getting your car serviced. 
Some lines are so subtle, it’s 
hard to tell what she’s really 
singing about — I’m not sure if 
she’s looking for sex or if she 
just has a really fucked-up car. 
But no fear, she brings all the 
tricks out on “Holy Water” and 
“S.E.X.” “Holy Water,” which 
was produced by Kanye, may 
be the oral-sex anthem of 2015 
(if there’s such a thing? I don’t 
know, but there should be). It 
almost sounds like a “fuck you” 
to Kim Kardashian between the 
lines, “Bitch, get off my pole” 
and “Yeezus loves my pussy 
best.” So, if you really want to 
know if it tastes like holy water, 
you know who to ask. 

Any subtlety that may be 

present in “Holy Water” or 
“Body Shop” is thrown out of 
the bedroom on “S.E.X.” The 
deep synths that are present 
throughout the track set the 
mood, and it quickly moves 
from semi-vanilla-headboard-
breaking-sex 
to 
something 

darker. Following a dark cackle, 
string instruments take over 
for the synths, and Madge 
lists off a string of sexually 
charged phrases (“raw meat” 
and “golden shower” included). 
In short, these songs are hot. 
The beats and lustful delivery 
of lyrics work to make listeners 
sweat in their seats.

Beyond the passion for sex, 

there’s a passion for life and 
love, — a forum for where she’s 
most infectious. The number-

one, “Living for Love,” opens the 
album with that tinge of auto-
tune present throughout Rebel 
Heart. The chorus, “I’m gonna 
carry on,” stands just above 
the rest of the track’s elements, 
creating a cloud of reassurance, 
which really anchors the track 
as an empowerment anthem. 
That, 
combined 
with 
the 

grinding 
post-chorus 
synth, 

creates an impeccable pop song. 
In a somewhat similar fashion, 
“Ghosttown” allows a snippet of 
silence before the chorus breaks, 
and it’s that short transition 
from the piano-assisted verse 
into 
the 
bold 
chorus 
that 

really 
highlights 
the 
track 

among its neighbors. Finally, 
“Joan of Arc” is her down-
to-earth 
masterpiece. 
Her 

vulnerability speaks volumes, 
as it’s surrounded by sex and 
uncontrolled 
confidence. 

The message is simple: words 
hurt, and they even hurt the 
queen of pop. A single guitar 
supports her until the chorus 
comes 
in 
and 
she 
proves 

there’s strength in embracing 
vulnerability. Production and 
delivery take what would be 
a self-deprecating track and 
transform it into a powerhouse.

Finally, 
there 
are 
tracks 

that transcend any category 
imaginable. 
The 
dubstep 

inspired “Illuminati” is a club 
banger, and nothing less. The 
baseline begs to be moved 
to and the constant name-
dropping is simply lurid fun. 
The 
Super 
Deluxe 
Album’s 

closer, “I’m Addicted,” begins 
slowly, but soon blossoms into 
an amazingly catchy chorus, 
completed with rhymes and 
an infectious guitar rhythm. It 
succeeds at bringing together 
25 tracks worth of journey into 
a final track. The albums other 
feat is its title track. “Rebel 
Heart” is simply stunning; it’s 
retrospective, but also looks at 
the future with optimism. Her 
critics will say she’s desperately 
clasping at her youth, but 
“Rebel Heart” and Rebel Heart, 
for that matter, show that she 
recognizes the growth that she 
has experienced over her past 
13 albums, and that she’s where 
she wants to be.

Rebel Heart relies on its three 

chambers of confidence, sex 
and passion to pick up the pace 
of its lacking fourth chamber. 
And like any heart, it needs 
more than its four chambers 
to keep it beating; It needs 
something greater. Rebel Heart 
has that something greater.

FILM REVIEW
‘Shadows’ bites into 
vampire pop culture

By CONRAD FOREMAN

Daily Arts Writer

The 
exposure 
that 

documentary films can give 
to an underrepresented group 
can 
change 

the 
dialogue 

surrounding 
important 
issues. 
The 

college 
generation 
would 
best 

remember 
this 
from 

“Super 
Size 

Me,” the 2004 
exposé on fast 
food from Morgan Spurlock. 
Playing for a limited time at 
Ann Arbor’s State Theatre is an 
equally important documentary 
from the minds of brilliant 
New Zealand comedians Taika 
Waititi (“Boy”) and Jemaine 
Clement (HBO’s “Flight of the 
Conchords”).

“What We Do in the Shadows” 

follows three flatmates, Viago 
(Waititi), Vladislav (Clement) 
and Deacon (Jonathan Brugh, 
“How to Meet Girls from a 
Distance”). The trio’s dynamic is 
much like that of any group that 
lives together. They argue over 

chores, help each other select 
outfits and provide a support 
system based on camaraderie. 
There’s one wrinkle — Viago, 
Vladislav and Deacon are all 
vampires, aged 317, 862 and 183, 
respectively. Along with their 
8,000-year-old fourth flatmate, 
a newly turned vampire, and 
everyone’s 
favorite 
human, 

Petyr (Ben Fransham, “30 Days 
of Night”) the vamps navigate 
the hardships of everyday life 
for the undead.

The film points out that 

immortality isn’t all it’s cracked 
up to be, especially when it 
comes at a cost. Vampires not 
only fear burning alive from 
any exposure to sunlight, but, 
whether they like it or not, they 
must feed on human flesh for 
sustenance. This is especially 
problematic when Viago can’t 
avoid a main artery in the neck, 
leading to quite the messy 
dinner.

Vampires 
find 
themselves 

disadvantaged in more mundane 
ways as well. Just like any of us, 
when the gang wants a night on 
the town, the most important 
decision to make is what they’ll 
wear. Their decision-making 
is more difficult than ours, 
though, because of vampires’ 

inability to create a reflection; 
they must rely completely on 
their flatmates’ guidance. Once 
they finally make their way 
downtown, their entrance to 
any nightclub is often blocked 
by the necessity for them to 
receive an explicit invitation 
before entering.

“What 
We 
Do 
in 
the 

Shadows” 
succeeds 
because 

the production perfectly toes 
the line between realism and 
ridiculousness. 
This 
starts 

with the cast, highlighted by 
Waititi and Clement, but with 
exceptional 
performances 

from every player. The special 
effects, shockingly real at times 
and cheesy at others, also work 
to create the seriously silly 
tone.

“Shadows” takes vampires, 

a concept with prevalence and 
resonance in pop culture, and 
de-glamorizes them, de-roman-
ticizes them. It shows that vam-
pires need companionship just 
as humans do, and that immor-
tality can be as excruciating 
as it is enriching. More than 
anything else, the film shows 
that what they do in the shad-
ows, while not as abnormal or 
demonic as one might expect, is 
certainly hilarious.

FILM REVIEW
‘Chappie’ falters

By NOAH COHEN

Daily Arts Writer

Some movies are good despite 

being obviously bad. With Hugh 
Jackman (“The Wolverine”) and 
Die Antwoord’s 
Yolandi Vi$$er 
and 
Watkin 

Tudor 
Jones 

headlining, 
“Chappie” was 
supposed to be 
one 
of 
those 

movies. 
It’s 

weird, has comic appeal, has a 
uniquely Johannesburg cultural 
flavor, hosts penetrating philo-
sophical questions and sob-worthy 
reels. But it fails where a crappy 
movie isn’t allowed to fail: It isn’t 
enjoyable to watch, and it doesn’t 
leave the audience with good feel-
ings. It’s a minstrel show of vio-
lence followed by a wild stab at 
creative A.I. storytelling that may 
be compelling depending on how 
stupid you are, but at that point it 
doesn’t matter.

Cross your fingers and pray that 

“District 9” wasn’t Neill Blom-
kamp’s “Sixth Sense,” because he’s 
on a familiar downward spiral. 
Strangeness, as it’s leveraged in 
action movies, is a delicate partici-
pant and can’t be tonally dominant 
without subverting the action. 
Seating strangeness in the fore-
ground of “Chappie” puts too 
much stress on a script not coor-
dinated to juggle the shallow 
with the deep. This brings us to 
Hugh Jackman.

Hugh Jackman doesn’t know 

how to be a bad guy. He doesn’t 
have it in him. Compare his roles 
in “X-Men Origins: Wolverine,” 
“Swordfish” and “Real Steel.” 
Jackman can play a Byronic Hero, 
but he’s never had the emotional 
complexity to withstand the moral 

tidying in “Chappie.” Jackman is 
a chest-hair champion; when he 
tries to be a baddie, he just reads 
the script louder and goes harder 
in the paint. No fresh angles on 
the warmonger archetype are 
addressed here.

Dev Patel (“Slumdog Million-

aire”) plays an amazing Dev Patel. 
In fact, it’s doubtful that anyone 
could play Dev Patel as well as Dev 
Patel. Truly inspiring work. A+. The 
best acting is no acting. This brings 
us to Die Antwoord.

Die Antwoord (Afrikaans for 

“The Answer”) is a band and per-
sonality-cult composed of Watkin 
Tudor Jones, stage name “Ninja” 
and Anri du Toit, stage name 
Yolandi Vi$$er. Their stage perso-
nas are borderline psychopathic, 
and they play these exact stage 
personas in “Chappie.” Even their 
names in “Chappie” are their band 
stage names. Their band’s music 
plays in the background multiple 
times. The level of influence these 
two non-actor actors have over the 
whole production of “Chappie” 
is ridiculous and surreal. It’s as if 
the movie was written to accom-
modate the off-set antics of these 
two cast members. If anything is 
extraordinary about this film, it’s 
the power Die Antwoord wields 
over it.

One arguable plus to this mis-

take of a science-fiction is that 
“Chappie” is littered with refer-
ential and insane gimmicks. Rub-
ber chickens, “He-Man,” ninja 
stars and Anderson Cooper play-
ing Anderson Cooper in his debut 
acting role. No kidding. Google 
Anderson Cooper and Control-
F on “filmography.” This is the 
first movie to which he’s lent his 
incredible professional reputation.

“Chappie” is “Wall-E” fucked 

up beyond recognition. You love 
Chappie himself and you hate the 
world he’s born into. This film por-
trays South Africa as a sprawling, 
morally bankrupt, tech-hub trash 
heap. I want to accuse “Chappie” 
of cashing in on the American per-
ception of Africa as a savage place, 
but Die Antwoord is as authenti-
cally South African as you can get, 
without actually being Zulu.

Honestly, this movie would 

have been way cooler if Chappie 
had been raised as a Zulu, instead 
of a cheap Zef meme. Remove 
all the poorly-acted antagonists 
and let’s have that movie instead. 
Die Antwoord is the answer to a 
question Hollywood never asked, 
and “Chappie” is cut from the 
same cloth, a buckshot attempt at 
comic steampunk. For each note it 
strikes true, it gruesomely muti-
lates two others. It’s a feel-bad 
flick, overall.

home near Mount Carbon, W.Va. Bounds said he is thankful to be alive after fleeing his home seconds before it was destroyed. 
Wisconsin Gov. signs bill 
ending forced union dues 

Weather conditions 
prompt change of 
location for the race 

PFAIRBANKS, Alaska (AP) 

— Iditarod mushers began their 
1,000-mile trek across Alaska 
along a new route Monday after 
poor trail conditions forced orga-
nizers to push the race’s start 
north, bypassing a mountain 
range.

Canadian rookie Rob Cooke, 

who hails from Whitehorse, 
Yukon Territory, was the first 
musher to leave Fairbanks as fans 
looked on from the starting gate 
and along the expressway.

The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog 

Race usually kicks off 225 miles 
south in Willow. But because of 
a lack of snow this year, officials 
shifted the entire route around 

the Alaska Range and an area 
that left many mushers bruised 
and bloodied last year.

This is only the second time 

Fairbanks has hosted the official 
start; similar low-snow condi-
tions moved the Iditarod there in 
2003.

The finish line remains in 

Nome, on the state’s wind-
whipped western coast.

The route change eliminates 

mountainous 
terrain 
and 
a 

treacherous gorge. But the race 
now will be run on about 600 
miles of river ice, and that can 
create a whole new set of obsta-
cles.

Some mushers have hinted the 

new path might benefit Pete Kai-
ser, a young musher who recently 
won an all-river ice sled dog race 
in southwest Alaska. Kaiser dis-
puted that Monday.

“I don’t see it as an advantage 

or disadvantage for me or anyone 
else, really,” he said as he took 
a break from packing his sled 
before the race started.

“It’s just another trail through 

the state, and it’s still a thousand 
miles, and it’s still through some 
rugged country,” Kaiser said.

Lance Mackey is running the 

race with a young dog team and 
is handling the changes in stride.

The four-time champion said 

the fact that most of the thousand 
or so dogs participating in the 
race have never seen this part of 
Alaska is “kind of cool.”

“Not a dog in this yard has 

been on this trail or this race,” 
Mackey said. “Everybody’s on the 
same playing field in that aspect.

The new route reduces the 

number of checkpoints in the 
early part of the race, but it adds 
stops at villages that have never 
been part of the Iditarod — like 

tiny Huslia, an Athabascan vil-
lage of about 300 residents.

Alaska’s 
fairly 
warm 
and 

snowless winter was caused by 
the same weather pattern that 
repeatedly dumped snow on the 
East Coast. It has made for poor 
conditions south of the Alaska 
Range, especially in the area of 
the Dalzell Gorge, considered the 
roughest patch for mushers and 
dogs.

This is where many mushers 

were injured in crashes last year. 
Officials said this year’s condi-
tions there are worse.

Four-time champion Martin 

Buser said the lack of snow in the 
greater Anchorage area made for 
a challenging training season.

Buser said he intends to slow 

his start this year after setting a 
blistering pace in the early part 
of last year’s race and then fading 
back.

Legislation cements 
freedom to work, 

Walker says

ABROWN DEER, Wis. (AP) — 

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker on 
Monday signed into law a mea-
sure that prohibits requiring a 
worker to pay union dues, striking 
another blow against organized 
labor four years after the state 
effectively ended collective bar-
gaining for public-sector employ-
ees.

Walker, a likely presidential 

candidate fresh off a weekend 
visit to Iowa, signed the right-to-
work bill affecting private-sector 
workers at an invitation-only cer-
emony at Badger Meter north of 
Milwaukee. The company’s presi-
dent was one of the few business 
owners who publicly supported 
the measure, which rocketed 
through the Legislature in less 
than two weeks.

His sleeves rolled up and his 

suit jacket off, the Republican 
governor sat at a table with a ban-
ner that said “Freedom to Work” 
as he signed the bill that makes it 
a misdemeanor to require work-

ers to pay unions dues.

Just before the signing, Walker 

said the new law “sends a power-
ful message across the country 
and around the world.” He fol-
lowed that up with a fundraising 
plea to supporters.

“The Big Government Labor 

Bosses will never forgive me for 
taking away their power but we 
are doing the right thing,” Walker 
said in the email, noting that he 
had signed the law and asking for 
donations of $10, $100 and $1,000.

Supporters have argued the 

law will help keep and attract 
new businesses that were wary 
of spending in Wisconsin before. 
But opponents say it will drive 
down wages and make the work-
place less safe.

“By signing Right to Work into 

law, Gov. Walker continues his 
crusade on the hard-working, 
middle-class families of Wiscon-
sin,” said Phil Neuenfeldt, presi-
dent of the Wisconsin AFL-CIO 
in a prepared statement.

President 
Barack 
Obama 

issued a statement late Monday 
that called on Walker to improve 
working 
conditions 
through 

actions such as raising wages or 
offering paid leave.

“I’m deeply disappointed that 

a new anti-worker law in Wis-
consin will weaken, rather than 
strengthen workers in the new 
economy,” he said.

A coalition of more than 400 

businesses formed to oppose the 
bill and upward of 3,000 union 
members and others gathered at 
the Capitol in a failed attempt to 
block its passage.

Walker was surrounded Mon-

day by Republican lawmakers 
who shepherded the bill through 
the process, including Assembly 
Speaker Robin Vos and Senate 
Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald. 
Representatives from the state 
chamber of commerce, along with 
Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, were 
also on hand.

“This is one more big tool to 

help places like Badger Meter, 
when they can put jobs anywhere 
around the world, they can put 
them in Wisconsin,” Walker said.

Badger Meter’s chief executive 

and chairman Rich Meeusen said 
because of the law the company 
will place a $2.5 million piece of 
new water control equipment at 
the Brown Deer facility and that 
will lead to 30 to 50 new manufac-
turing jobs in the state.

After federal report, 

judge tasked with 

enacting reforms for 

municipal court

 JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) 
— A Missouri appeals court judge 
was appointed Monday to take 
over Ferguson’s municipal court 
and make “needed reforms” after 
a highly critical U.S. Department 
of Justice report that was prompt-
ed by the fatal police shooting of 
Michael Brown.
 The Missouri Supreme Court 
said it is assigning state appeals 
Judge Roy L. Richter to hear all 
of Ferguson’s pending and future 
municipal court cases. The high 
court said Richter also will have 
the authority to overhaul court 
policies to ensure defendants’ 
rights are respected and to 
“restore the integrity of the sys-
tem.”
 Ferguson Municipal Judge Ron-
ald J. Brockmeyer resigned Mon-
day, saying through a spokesman 
that he was stepping down to 
promote public confidence in the 
court and help Ferguson “begin 
its healing process.”
 The Ferguson City Council met 
in closed session Monday evening, 
but members left without taking 
questions and a city spokesman 
didn’t disclose the purpose of the 
meeting. Ferguson City Manager 
John Shaw was escorted to his 
vehicle by a police officer with-
out fielding questions, and Mayor 
James Knowles III declined com-
ment to The Associated Press 
afterward except to say that the 
city on Tuesday would begin 
seeking Brockmeyer’s permanent 
successor.

 Richter will take charge of the 
court on March 16. The Supreme 
Court said it also is assigning 
staff from the state court admin-
istrator’s office to aid Richter in 
reviewing Ferguson’s municipal 
court practices.
 “Judge Richter will bring a 
fresh, disinterested perspective 
to this court’s practices, and he 
is able and willing to implement 
needed reforms,” Chief Justice 
Mary Russell said in a written 
statement.
 “Extraordinary action is war-
ranted in Ferguson, but the Court 
also is examining reforms that are 
needed on a statewide basis,” Rus-
sell added.
 The change comes after the Jus-
tice Department released a report 
last week that cited cases of racial 
profiling and bigotry by police 
and chided what it described as a 
profit-driven municipal court sys-
tem in the predominantly black 
St. Louis suburb where Brown, 
18, was shot by a white Ferguson 
police officer on Aug. 9. The shoot-
ing prompted protests in the St. 
Louis area and across the nation.
 A St. Louis County grand jury 
and the U.S. Justice Department 
both declined to bring charges 
against Officer Darren Wilson, 
who resigned from the depart-
ment. The Justice Department 
report said Wilson acted in self-
defense when he shot Brown.
 But the Justice Department said 
Ferguson’s police and court sys-
tems functioned as a money-mak-
ing enterprise that heightened 
tensions among residents.
The federal report noted that Fer-
guson was counting on revenues 
from fines and fees to generate 
$3.1 million, or nearly one-quar-
ter of its total $13.3 million bud-
get for the 2015 fiscal year.

LSA junior Tiffany Brocke 

took the previous version of the 
MCAT in August 2014, and has 
no plans to retake the new one. 
However, she said the changes 
in the test, particularly the new 
emphasis on sociology and psy-
chology, will likely benefit stu-
dents.

“I think it’s important for doc-

tors to have an understanding 
of people as social animals and 
how complex the mind is as well 
as the physical body,” Brocke 
said. “I do think it’s important 
to evaluate that understanding 
of people on a personality level, 
so I think it’s a positive change 
overall.”

In addition to demanding 

more endurance and a broader 
material base from test takers, 
the new MCAT test will also 
serve as a challenge for medical 
school admissions officers. Chiu 
noted that for the next few years, 
medical school admissions offic-
es will be tasked with compar-
ing applications from students 
who have taken the old MCAT 
to those who have taken the new 
version.

“This is going to be a chal-

lenge for medical schools to fig-
ure out how they compare test 
scores across the two exams,” 
Chiu said. “But remember that 
the new exam is meant to help 
medical schools make even bet-
ter decisions, so as much as pos-
sible they’re going to be looking 
for ways to use that new score 
to inform better decisions about 
applicants.”

The new test will be scored 

differently from the previous 
1-15 and 3-45 scale. Each section 
will range from a low score of 
118 to a high score of 132. Total 
scores will range from 472 to 
528.

Changes 
in 
the 
MCAT’s 

demands reflect broader adjust-
ments in the demands of medi-
cal schools. The University’s 
Medical School recently revised 
its 
admissions 
requirements 

to include a humanities-based 
experience and to encourage 
applicants to learn necessary 
material in unique and alterna-
tive ways.

Steven Gay, assistant dean 

of admissions at the University 
Medical School, said he believes 
the MCAT is being updated in 
response to changes that have 
already starting occurring in 

pre-medical education.

“I’m very pleased that the 

MCAT is trying to mirror what 
schools find are very important 
characteristics to have as you go 
to medical school,” Gay said.

Brocke, 
the 
LSA 
junior, 

echoed Gay’s opinion on the 
changes, saying she believes the 
entire process is becoming more 
holistic.

“Overall, I think it reflects a 

trend of looking at the applicant 
as a person and much less as a set 
of numbers and achievements 
and extracurricular activities,” 
Brocke said.

LSA freshman Krishna Vemu-

lapalli said he disagrees with the 
MCAT’s added focus on humani-
ties-related topics.

“I think the humanities is 

something that students should 
learn on their own, rather than 
being tested on for medical 
school,” Vemulapalli said.

Chiu said the more demand-

ing exam should not discourage 
pre-med hopefuls.

“Pre-med students are a highly 

motivated group of students, so 
it’s unlikely that this more chal-
lenging exam will deter them 
from aspiring to medical school,” 
he said.

Injured woman 

recalls 2013 attack

BOSTON (AP) — A woman 

testifying from a wheelchair 
Monday in the Boston Marathon 
bombing trial recalled shielding 
her husband from the sight of his 
mangled leg, being pushed to the 
ground by a bystander frantically 
trying to extinguish the flames 
on her body and coming to grips 
with becoming a double amputee.

Jessica Kensky said she and her 

husband, Patrick Downes, each 
lost a left leg in the 2013 attack. 
After more than 18 months of 
surgeries and consultations with 
doctors around the country, she 
came to the painful conclusion 

that her right leg would have to be 
amputated, too, she said.

“I did not want to become a 

bilateral amputee,” Kensky said. 
“I wanted to paint my toenails, 
I wanted to put my feet in the 
sand, and I wanted to do all these 
things. To lose the second leg was 
a 
gut-wrenching, 
devastating 

decision.”

Kensky’s account came dur-

ing the third day of testimony 
in the federal death penalty 
trial of bomber Dzhokhar Tsar-
naev, whose own lawyers have 
acknowledged his involvement 
but insist he was influenced by his 
older brother, Tamerlan, who was 
killed during a getaway attempt 
days after the bombings.

Jurors also watched a timeline 

video compiled by the FBI using 
surveillance video from stores 
and restaurants near the mara-
thon finish line. The video, which 
shows both brothers’ movements 
around the time of the bombings, 
focuses on Dzhokhar and shows 
him carrying a backpack up until 
he gets to the front of the Forum 
restaurant, when he is shown 
dropping the bag from his shoul-
der.

One frame then shows the 

backpack at his feet. The back-
pack is in a crowd of people and 
just feet from children stand-
ing on a metal barrier, including 
8-year-old Martin Richard, who 
was killed, and his younger sis-
ter, Jane, who lost a leg in the 
blast.

Putting Band-Aids on 

an open wound

A

ndrew Copp slouches in a 
big blue chair and tosses 
his matching blue hat at 

his feet. He sighs and he smirks, 
peering at the 
floor while 
embodying 
the persona 
of a captain 
who is 
flat-out 
exasperated.

He 

chuckles as 
he reiterates 
the focus of 
this week’s 
practice. Spoiler alert — it’s no 
different from any other week.

“Defense,” Copp said.
He looks up at the ceiling and 

lets out one final sigh.

It’s been that kind of season 

for the 19th-ranked Wolverines. 
It’s been that kind of season that 
punches you hard in the gut 
when you’re flying high after a 
seven-game winning streak. It’s 
been that kind of season that has 
comprised more than one spell of 
disaster.

And now, with one weekend 

left in the regular season, it’s 
shaping up to be that kind of 

season that will be doomed with 
another setback.

Michigan is squirming in 

its position with little time to 
resolve the discomfort. It sits in 
a tie for second place in the Big 
Ten with Minnesota and enters 
its final games on the wrong 
side of the NCAA Tournament 
bubble.

The Wolverines still control 

their own destiny at capturing 
both the conference title and 
a tournament bid, but they’re 
wrestling with the same demon 
— defense — that has slapped 
their backs against the wall for a 
third time this season.

“Everyone knows the 

circumstances,” Copp said. 
“Everyone knows what we need 
to do this weekend.”

The current task at hand is 

shoring up a defense that appears 
to be permanently broken, and 
it’s a task that probably isn’t 
attainable. Michigan’s defense 
has been its Achilles heel all year, 
and the defense has been the 
topic of discussion at practice, 
in team meetings, among the 
Wolverine fanbase and around 
the Big Ten.

It’s been puzzling that the 

defensive effort cannot keep up, 
even remotely, with Michigan’s 
top-ranked offense. Sometimes 
the defensive issues are 
schematic, sometimes they’re 
personnel issues and sometimes 
they’re problems executing.

These three roots of a 

lackluster defense are seldom 
absent from Michigan’s play, 
and that much is worrisome as 
the Wolverines buckle up for the 
most critical stretch of the season.

“Obviously it’s going to 

dictate how our year is looked at, 
basically,” Copp said.

Hearing the term “defense” 

must sound like a broken record, 
but the music won’t stop while 
Michigan coach Red Berenson 
persistently preaches it as the 
Wolverines continuously fail 
to string together consistent 
performances in the defensive 
zone.

Getting a consistent 

60-minute performance has 
even been a protruding issue. 
If they don’t crack the code to 
the mysterious hole in their 
game, they’ll miss the NCAA 
Tournament for the third 
consecutive year — and also the 

third time in the past 25 years.

“Defense is going to be 

what we’ll be focusing on, and 
hopefully we get it figured out,” 
Copp said.

Michigan is left with the 

empty hope that a sound 
defensive performance will pop 
up. Attempts to permanently fix 
the issue haven’t been effective 
all season long.

Michigan hockey has oozed 

excellence for nearly all of 
Berenson’s tenure behind the 
bench, but this team’s defense is 
anything but excellent.

That leaves Berenson 

unsatisfied. He’s a defensive-
minded hockey legend who likes 
a 2-1 victory more than a 7-5 
barnburner.

But his 31st team hasn’t given 

him what he likes. Copp knows 
that. Everyone in the locker 
room knows that. No one knows 
how to fix it, though.

The problem is a tiresome 

one, an issue that has been 
highlighted and underlined 
and circled countless times. If 
something isn’t broken, it’s easy 
to avoid fixing it, but sometimes 
when something is so broken, 

there’s no point in fixing it.

That appears to be the case 

for Michigan. Recurring issues 
such as lapses in defensive-zone 
coverage, failed clearances and an 
inability to break out of its own 
zone are not signs of progress.

Inconsistency does mean 

there have been moments of 
greatness, but they’ve been 
sprinkled out over the course 
of a five-month season. Being 
inconsistent means there’s 
potential, but that potential is 
only sometimes fulfilled.

Occasionally, the Wolverines 

can play defense. Occasionally, 
they cannot play defense. It has 
been a roller coaster of a season, 
and they’ve been on the ride that 
never leaves that dark tunnel. 
Michigan rarely knows the 
direction it’s headed, whether a 
sound defensive performance is 
on the horizon or not.

“I think it’s just something 

we need to go out and prove to 
ourselves,” Copp said, “prove 
that we can be that unbelievably 
skilled, fast, talented team and 
still play rock-solid defense 
and play a 200-foot, two-way 
game, which we’ve shown that 
we’re capable of, but it’s been 

inconsistent.”

Then, Copp picks up his hat 

and saunters out of the room. 
A typically upbeat leader of 
the Michigan hockey program 
appears beaten and battered, and 
that’s because he has been. His 
team has been, too.

The Wolverines aren’t going 

to fix their entire defense before 
this weekend’s crucial home-
and-home series with Michigan 
State. They might pick up some 
pieces and improve in small 
areas, and that might be enough 
to skate by for a weekend.

If it’s not, Michigan will know 

where it fell short. It isn’t going 
to piece together a flawless 
performance. With kinks in the 
armor, the Wolverines have to 
iron out those dents as best as 
they can, even while some aren’t 
reparable.

They’ve scooted by, just 

barely, with a suspect defense all 
year. They’re getting tired of it by 
now, but sometimes you just have 
to let the broken record play on.

Beilein, Bielfeldt won’t 
close door on fifth year

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

Over the summer, prior to the 

start of the 2014-15 campaign, 
Michigan men’s basketball coach 
John 
Beilein 
informed 
Max 

Bielfeldt that the coming season 
would be his last at Michigan.

The news didn’t come as a 

surprise. Bielfeldt had two years 
of eligibility remaining after 
redshirting his freshman year, 
but he had played sparingly in the 
past two seasons. His scholarship 
spot 
gave 
Beilein 
recruiting 

flexibility for next year and 
beyond. In every way, the move 
made sense.

Saturday, prior to Michigan’s 

79-69 win over Rutgers, Bielfeldt 
was 
honored 
at 
midcourt 

alongside his parents as the 
Wolverines’ 
lone 
senior. 
He 

received 
numerous 
standing 

ovations from the crowd of 12,357 
at Crisler Center. In his 67th 
college 
appearance, 
Bielfeldt 

even earned his first career start.

But there’s now a chance — 

small as it is — that the pomp and 
circumstance was all for naught. 
Saturday, 
after 
maintaining 

throughout 
the 
season 
that 

Bielfeldt’s status as a senior 
hadn’t changed, Beilein came 
short of closing the book on a fifth 
year at Michigan for the 6-foot-7 
forward in his postgame press 
conference.

“I don’t think anything’s ever 

closed,” Beilein said. “I wanted to 
make sure that we under-promise 
and over-deliver.”

What’s 
most 
important 

to Beilein, it seemed, is due 
diligence.

“I would like him to go out and 

explore some options,” Beilein 
said. “We’ll look at some options 
and decide whether it’s a good 
option (for Bielfeldt) to come 
back.”

On Senior Day, he posted his 

first career double-double after 
starting in place of freshman 
forward 
Ricky 
Doyle, 
who 

emerged early in the season as 
Michigan’s starting big man. 
Bielfeldt even fell to third on the 
depth chart at various points, 
playing whatever minutes Doyle 
and redshirt freshman forward 
Mark Donnal didn’t.

It didn’t faze Bielfeldt, who 

was fully healthy this season for 
the first time in recent memory. 
He had successful hip surgery 
last spring, which brought back 
hops and mobility that had been 
hindered over the years by the 
long-term injury.

“You love the game, but the 

game’s not loving you,” Bielfeldt 
said. “The game’s making it hurt. 
… With me feeling a lot better, 
with me getting the opportunities 
this year, it’s pretty cool.”

As for his plans next season, 

Bielfeldt is as much in the dark as 
anybody else.

“Honestly, I don’t know,” 

Bielfeldt 
said. 
“Family 
and 

friends ask me the same thing 
— I give them the same answer. 
I really don’t know. I just like 
knowing what my options are. 
I’m obviously just going to look 
for options and kinda weigh them 
out.”

The most important question, 

it seems, is whether Michigan 
wants Bielfeldt back. As for 
the 
second-most 
important 

— whether he would enjoy an 
encore in Ann Arbor — Bielfeldt 
took the most diplomatic route 
possible when asked, saying 
Michigan “would definitely be on 
my list.”

“I’ve had great memories, 

great friends here,” Bielfeldt said.

It seems like Max Bielfeldt 

wants back in. And if he 
can replicate even half his 
productivity from Saturday on 
a consistent basis, there’s little 
reason for Beilein, as he said, not 
to “over-deliver.”

When it matters most, 

Sparty still reigns

H

OFFMAN ESTATES, 
Ill. — After watching 
only a minute of both 

Michigan 
and 
Michigan 
State’s press 
conferences, 
it was 
apparent 
which team 
had won 
Thursday’s 
second round 
matchup 
of the 
Big Ten Women’s Basketball 
Tournament.

In one press conference, 

Spartan guards Lexi Gussert 
and Tori Jankoska and forward 
Aerial Powers giggled with each 
question asked. More chuckling 
ensued when Jankoska spilled 
Gatorade all over herself.

Even Michigan State coach 

Suzy Merchant was upbeat and 
cheerful, a huge difference from 
her demeanor a month ago in East 
Lansing, where the Spartans lost 
to the Wolverines, 72-59.

Twenty minutes later, 

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico, guard Shannon Smith and 
forward Nicole Elmblad walked 
into the press conference room, 
and if it wasn’t apparent who had 
won, the trio made it even more 
obvious who lost.

The room was in stark 

contrast: There wasn’t any 
giggling, no one chuckled over 
spilled Gatorade and Barnes 
Arico was definitely not her 
usual chipper self.

While it was hard at times 

to hear through the solemn 
mumblings, one thing was clear, 
and Barnes Arico summarized it 
perfectly.

“They really played well 

tonight,” Barnes Arico said. 
“They shot the basketball 
extremely well. We didn’t.”

Added Elmblad: 

“Unfortunately, we weren’t hitting 
shots, and they were.”

And that was it. Michigan 

State simply outplayed the 
Wolverines from start to finish.

Once again, Michigan lost its 

shooting touch while it seemed 
that, for most of the game, the 
other team couldn’t miss.

Coming into the matchup, 

the Wolverines had the clear 
advantage after sweeping the 
season series. Not only that, 
but Merchant had just six 
scholarship players on the roster.

But when it mattered the 

most, Michigan State’s players 
stepped up to the plate while 
Michigan couldn’t get anything 
rolling offensively.

Gussert started off the game 

hot, shooting 4-for-4 from 
behind the arc and finishing 
with a game-high 16 points after 
going 1-for-10 last time the two 
teams faced off. Powers, an All-
Big Ten First Team member, was 
her usual self, earning a double-
double with 16 points and 15 
rebounds.

If it wasn’t obvious before 

which team showed up to play, it 
should be now.

“When you’re in situations 

where you win and you stay, or 
you lose and go home, you give 
it your all every single game.” 
Powers said.

Michigan, on the other hand, 

didn’t appear to ever come to 
that realization.

The Wolverines had their 

second-lowest scoring half of the 
season in the first half, scoring 
just 22 points.

And if you thought things 

couldn’t get any worse in the 
second half, man, were you 
wrong.

“One of my assistants said, 

well, our shooting can’t get 
any worse in the second half, 
and actually it did, which is 
incredible,” Barnes Arico said.

The Wolverines shot just 16.7 

percent from the behind the arc 
and 24.3 percent overall in the 
second half. Michigan ended up 
taking a whopping 70 shots, but 
made just 19 of them in the game.

But if you think this is the 

first time Michigan State has 
outplayed Michigan in the Big 
Ten Tournament, you’re also 
mistaken.

In fact, the win marked 

the third consecutive year 
the Spartans had knocked the 
Wolverines out of the Big Ten 
Tournament, and the fifth 
overall. Michigan has never 
beaten Michigan State in the Big 
Ten Tournament.

Two years ago, the squads met 

in the quarterfinals, where the 
Wolverines went without a field 
goal for almost 10 minutes and 
couldn’t recover, dropping the 
game, 62-46.

And last year, the two teams 

met once again in the second 
round. Michigan led for most 
of the game before a furious 
comeback from Michigan State 
allowed the Spartans to come out 
victorious, 61-58.

The fact of the matter is, 

Michigan State has Michigan’s 
number when it has meant the 
most.

And it’s a form of dominance 

that could continue.

Next year, Michigan State will 

return the power trio of Powers, 
Jankoska and Gussert while 
Michigan will lose three key 
players to graduation in Elmblad, 
Smith and Goree.

So next year, if the two 

teams meet again in the Big Ten 
Tournament — and let’s face it, 
with the way things have gone 
the past three years, it could 
happen — someone is going to 
have to step up to the plate for the 
Wolverines.

Maybe it’ll be Flaherty or 

junior guard Madison Ristovski 
or even one of five incoming 
freshmen in a highly touted 
recruiting class.

But whoever she is, she’s going 

need to bring her ‘A’ game.

Because if not, Sparty’s reign 

will continue.
