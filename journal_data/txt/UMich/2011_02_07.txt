'U' hospitals visitor
policy already
complies with new
health care law
By MARY HANNAHAN
Daily Staff Reporter
Despite a new federal regula-
tion expanding hospital visitation
rights for same-sex couples, the
University Hospital's longstand-
ing non-discrimination policy
will remain the same.
The federal regulation -
which went into effect Jan. 18,
2011 as part of the Affordable
Health Care for America Act -
states that hospitals receiving
government funding may not for-
bid visitation rights on the basis of
a patient's sexual orientation.
But according to Kelly Parent,
the Patient & Family Centered
Care program coordinator at C.S.
Mott Children's Hospital, the fed-
eral regulation has not affected
visitation policies at University
hospitals, since same-sex couples
already have equal visitation
rights.

"U of M has always been very
open and progressive in realizing
thatit's not forustojudge, andit's
not for us to decide who the sup-
port person is," Parent said. "As
long as I've known, there's never
been a limitation saying that, 'No,
it's a same-sex partner, you can't
come in here."'
Cathy Kendrick, clinical nurse
manager for the Cardiac Inten-
sive Care-Unit at the University
Cardiovascular Center, said that
in her 16 years of nursing in the
same two units, the visitation
rules at the University hospital
has been the same regardless of
sexual orientation.
"They are no different from the
rules that govern a heterosexual
couple," Kendricksaid.
She a4ed that sexual orienta-
tion is never a relevant factor in
securing visitation rights.
"It's not something that we
intentionally need to know about
the person," Kendrick said.
"There's not a need to know what
the person's sexual orientation
is unless it's something that they
want to share with us for whatev-
er reason that's personal to them
or unless there is a medical rea-

Greek community
petitions for more
street lighting
By ANT MITCHELL
Daily StaffReporter
Following several recent
crimes in the Oxford Road area
near campus, students feeling
unsafe have decided to take

action.
Because of three robberies
over the course of the past four
months, members of the Greek
community at the University
have developed a petition for
improved street lighting in
the area. At the same time, the
Ann Arbor Police Department
is further investigating the
crimes.
Brian Jatczak, a sergeant in
the AAPD's Detective Bureau,

said the involvement of two
males in multiple robbery cases
in the Oxford Road area may be
related to the Oxford robber-
ies. He added that the bureau is
currently tracking stolen prop-
erty and following up on leads
from the most recent robbery,
which was an armed robbery
early in the morning on Jan. 18.
Prior to this, two male suspects
robbed two females atcgunpoint
late at night in December.

AAPD Sgt. Craig Flocken
said while nothing has been
confirmed in terms of evidence,
AAPD has begun examining
the possible ,link between the
crimes.
LSA senior Katie Rosenberg,
past president of the Panhel-
lenic Association, wrote the

tiative, which is a petition to the

'U' student group
seeks to remove
cameras from
public places
By SABIRA KHAN
Daily StaffReporter
For LSA junior William Leaf,
a year and half of tireless work
may finally be coming to frui-
tion.
Last September, Leaf found-

ed the campus organization,
Students Against Surveillance,
with the intent to pass a city
ordinance that would restrict
the use of government surveil-
lance cameras in public areas.
The Ann Arbor City Democratic
Party officially endorsed the
ordinance on Saturdy.
Leaf said if passed, the ordi-'
nance - which applies only to
government-supervised cam-
eras - would ban cameras from
residential neighborhoods and
outdoor parks in Ann Arbor.
It would also limit the use of

cameras in commercial areas
so cameras are placed only in
zones that fall within the city's
top 10th percentile of crime
occurrences. Under the ordi-
nance, the police would also be
obligated to publish the loca-
tions of all the cameras on the
Ann Arbor police website.
Mary Hall-Thiam, vice chair
for outreach and inclusion for
The Ann Arbor City Democratic
Party, said the group issued a

Green Bay beats Pittsburgh 31-25
in Super Bowl XLV championship

Packers win fourth
Super Bowl title in
team's history
ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -
Aaron Rodgers has turned the
Green Bay Packers into Super
Bowl champions once again.
Rodgers threw three touch-
down passes and Nick Collins
returned an interception for
another score, leading the Pack-
ers to a 31-25 victory over the
Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday.
This was Green Bay's fourth
Super Bowl title. The Packers
won the first two Super Bowls
with Vince Lombardi coaching
Bart Starr, and captured another
with Brett Favre in January 1997.
The Steelers trailed 21-3 before

halftime. Ben Roethlisberger
got them within 28-25 midway
through the fourth quarter with
a touchdown pass and a nifty
2-point conversion. The Packers
answered with a field goal, giving
Roethlisberger one last chance.
Needing to go 87 yards in 1:59
with one timeout left, Roethlis-
berger couldn't make it across
midfield. I
As the Packers ran out the
clock, fans chanted, "Go Pack
Go!" Rodgers - who was named
the game's MVP - wound up
with the ball, bouncing up and
down. He hugged Clay Matthews
Jr. near midfield as confetti shot
out of cannons and silver stream-
ers dropped.
"This is a great dayto be great,
baby," Jennings said.
"We've been a team that's

overcome adversity all year," he
added. "Our head captain goes
down, emotional in the locker
room. Our No. 1 receiver goes
down, more emotions are going,
flying in the locker room. But
we find a way to bottle it up and
exert it all out here on the field."
This was only the second time
Pittsburgh lost a Super Bowl. The
Steelers still have the most wins
with six, and are tied for the most
appearances with eight.
The crowd at Cowboys Stadi-
um was 91,060 paying attendees,
or 103,219 counting "creden-
tialed attendees." It fell short of
the record.
Rodgers was named MVP.
Green Bay led 21-17-after three
quarters, but the Packers were
without cornerbacks Charles
Woodson and Sam Shields and

receiver Donald Driver.
The Steelers had the momen-
tum, the experience and the
crowd - tens of thousands of
fans twirling "Terrible Towels"
and making things tough for
Rodgers to bark out signals at
times.
But on the first play of the
fourth quarter, with Pittsburgh
possibly driving for a go-ahead
touchdown, Rashard Menden-
hall fumbled on a hit by Clay
Matthews Jr. The Packers took
over at their own 45.
Jennings caught his second
TD pass of the game to give the
Packers a 28-17 lead with 11:57 to
play - theirthird touchdown fol-
lowing a takeaway.
The Packers' final points came
on a 23-yard field goal by Mason
Crosby with 2:07 left.

son for us to know."
Kendrick said in her experi-
ence working for the University
of Michigan Health System, there
haven't been any cases of homo-
sexual patients reporting differ-
ential treatment. She , describes
a situation in which one of her
patients treated at the hospital
was thankful to have his partner
there during a medicalemergency.
"His gratitude was based on
just the care that we delivered
and the fact that he was able to
be there with his partner during a
time of desperate need," Kendrick
said.
Prior to the implementation of
the new health care regulation,
homosexual individuals were
sometimes banned from visiting
their partners, even in cases of life
or death.
In these instances - which
often occurred in states where
gay marriage is illegal - same-sex
partners were not permitted visi-
tation rights because they didn't
legally qualify as family.
Parent said the University
Hospital has never denied any-
one these rights because patients
define who their family members

are. In addition, visitors designat-
ed as family are allowed to stay at
the patient's bedside 24/7 as part
of the UMHS patient visitation
policy.
"Family does not have to be a
blood relative; family is whoever
they define as their support person
or as their support people," Parent
said of the UMHS policy.
UMHS is also makingstrides to
get rid of the word "visitor" in its
written visitation policy, accord-
ing to Parent.
"We have gone a step further
saying that a parent, a spouse, a
same-sex partner or a child of an
adult patient should not be called
visitorsbecause we are not visitors
in the lives of our loved ones," Par-
ent said.
This distinction between being
called a "visitor" or "family" can
have a great impact on .family
members during emotional times,
Parent said.
"When my daughter was ill
a few years back, I would never
want to be termed as a visitor in
my daughter's life," she said. "My
identification badge would say
'visitor,' but now at Mott, all of the
identification badges say 'parent'
or 'grandparent' or 'spouse.' It's
saying you are family, so we're not
going to kick you out, even when
visitinghours are over."

Cuban leader urges
end to hunger strike

Woman fasts for
10-days to demand
husband's freedom
HAVANA (AP) - A leader of
Cuba's Ladies in White opposi-
tion group said yesterday that
she will urge a colleague to end
a 10-day old hunger strike she
launched to demand freedom for
her jailed husband, saying the
protest could be counterproduc-
tive.
Laura Pollan told The Associ-
ated Press she plans to travel to
the home of Alejandrina Garcia,
near the central city of Matanzas,
to deliver the message personally.
The Cuban government on

Friday released one of 11 politi-
cal prisoners still held follow-
ing a 2003 crackdown on dissent
that swept up 75 dissidents, and
the Catholic church announced
another release is imminent.
Garcia has been on a hunger
strike since January28 to demand
freedom for her husband, Dios-
dado Gonzalez, another of the
remaining 2003 prisoners.
Gonzalez and another political
prisoner joined the protest from
behind bars on Tuesday.
"We will talk to her about
putting aside the strike," Pol-
lan said Sunday before a protest
march by the Ladies in White,
which is comprised of the wives
and mothers of some of the jailed
political prisoners.

A 2009 settlement came called

Obama plans to visit
Northern Michigan

President will
discuss expanding
Internet access
MARQUETTE, Mich. (AP) -
President Barack Obama willvisit
Marquette on Thursday to talk
about expanding Internet access,
the White House said Friday.
In his State of the Union
address, Obama called for
expanding high-speed wireless
Internet access to 98 percent
of Americans within five years.
Doing so is part of a three-part
plan the president outlined to
help America "win the future."
White House spokesman Rob-
ert Gibbs said Marquette, a port
city in Michigan's Upper Peninsu-
la, is an example of a place where
local businesses have been able to
grow because of increased access
to the Internet. Obama won polit-
ically important Michigan during
the 2008 presidential election.
Obama is expected to tout
Northern Michigan University's
4G WiMax network, a new wire-
less technology that promises
faster data speeds than most cur-
rent cellular broadband networks.
Northern Michigan, in Mar-
quette, is the only university in
the U.S. using the technology, said
university spokeswoman Cindy
Paavola.
"Obviously we're very excited.
Presidents don't stop by the U.P.

every day," Paavola said.
Former President George W.
Bush made a campaign swing
through the area in the summer
of 2004.
Students at the university are
happy that school is in session
this time around - though the
weather will certainly be more of
a factor in February.
"They're very tech-savvy,
regardless of what their major is.
To be able to show off the technol-
ogy that they use every day to the
president of the United States is
fantastic," Paavola told The Asso-
ciated Press ina phone interview.

continue
CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's vice
president met with the out-
lawed Muslim Brotherhood and
other opposition groups for the
first time yesterday and offered
sweeping concessions, includ-
ing granting press freedom and
rolling back police powers in the
government's latest attempt to
try to end nearly two weeks of
upheaval
But the opposition leaders
held firm to a demand the gov-
ernment rejects: that President
Hosni Mubarak step down
immediately. And the source of
the opposition's sudden power
- the youthful protesters filling
Cairo's main square -'said they
weren't even represented at the
talks and won't negotiate until
Mubarakis.gone......
"None of those who attended
representus,"saidKhaledAbdul-
Hamid, one leader of a new coali-
tion representing at least five
youth movementsathat organized
the 13-day-old protests. "We are
determined to press on until our
number one demand is met" -
the ouster of Mubarak.
"The regime is retreating,"

Abdul-Hamid told The Associ-
ated Press. "It is making more
concessions every day."
At the same time, there were
signs that the paralysis grip-
ping the country since the crisis
began was easing yesterday, the
first day of Egypt's work week.
Some schools reopened for the
first time in more than a week,
and so did banks - though for
only three hours, with long lines
outside. A night curfew remains,
and tanks continue to ring the
city's central square and guard
government buildings, embas-
sies and other important institu-
tions.
Since protests began Jan. 25,
the 82-year-old Mubarak has
pledged not to seek another
term in elections to be held in
September. The government
promised that his son Gamal,
who had widely been expected
to succeed him, will not do so.
Mubarak appointed a vice presi-
dent - Omar Suleiman - for-the.
first time since he took office
three decades ago. He sacked
his Cabinet, named a new one
and promised reforms. And on
Saturday, the top leaders of the
ruling party, including Gamal
Mubarak, were purged.
Yesterday brought another
concession that would have been
unimaginable just amonth ago in

this tightly controlled country:
Suleiman's meeting with opposi-
tion groups including the funda-
mentalist Muslim Brotherhood,
which has been outlawed since
1954 but is the ruling party's
largest rival.
Egypt's opposition - essen-
tially banned by the government
for decades - has long been
hampered by a lack of cohesive-
ness. Sunday's talks could be a
sign the government is trying to
divide and conquer as it tries to
placate protesterswithout giving
in to their chief demand.
Mubarak is insisting he can-
not stand down now or it would
only deepen the chaos in his
country. The protesters, skepti-
cal of a regime they blame for
repression, corruption and wide-
spread poverty, vow to maintain
their pressure until Mubarak
leaves.
The United States gave key
backing to the regime's gradual
changes on Saturday, after Presi-
dent Barack Obama signaled
more strongly that it was time
for Mubarak to leave. Yesterday,
speaking to Fox News ahead of
the Super Bowl football broad-
cast, Obama said he would not
be drawn into predicting when
Mubarak would leave office.
"Only he knows what he's
going to do," Obama said.

Former Tunisian ruling
party suspends activities

Interior Minister's
move seen as
first step toward
dissolving party
TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) - Tuni-
sia's interior minister yesterday-
suspended all activities of the
country's former ruling party
amid the most serious protests
since the country's autocratic
president fled into exile less than
a month ago.
Fahrat Rajhi suspended all
meetings of the Democratic
Constitutional Rally, known as
the RCD, and ordered all party
offices or meeting places it owns
closed - ahead of a demand to
dissolve the party, a ministry
statement said.
The RCD embodied the poli-
cies of former President Zine
El Abidine Ben Ali, who fled
into exile Jan. 14 after a month
of nationwide anti-government
protests. The party became a

key instrument by which Ben Ali
maintained power, and by which
corruption spread. Should the
RCD be dissolve, it would be
among the most sweeping moves
since Ben Ali's departure.
The official TAP news agency,
which carried the statement,
said the measure was taken
--because of the "extremeurgen-
cy" of the situation, a reference
to deadly weekend protests
around Tunisia, and to "pre-
serve the higher interests of the
nation."
The announcement came
hours after crowds pillaged,
then burned a police station in
the northwestern city of Kef a
day after police shot dead at least
two demonstrators. It was the
worst violence in Tunisia since
Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia,
ending 23 years in power.
Protests have also erupted
in other corners of the North
African country, which is being
run by a caretaker government
before presidential elections to
be held in six to seven months.

nowpocalypse in Ann Arbor didn't turn out to be quite the

that the University wants to continue to have classes and is commit-

According to a Feb. 3 Daily article, there is
miscommunication between the University
and the city about plowing after snow storms.
Often, the University plows the sidewalks and
then the city plows the streets. But this blocks
the sidewalks with snow piles and doesn't
allow for wheelchair access to the sidewalk,
even though the sidewalk itself has been shov-
eled. And when the snow piles up along the
curbs, it's difficult for students in wheelchairs
to use the wheelchair lifts on their cars. Dis-
abled students have the opportunity to use
Paratransit Services, a University transporta-
tion system, but they said in the article that
they still have trouble getting to class.
The University had plenty of time to pre-
pare for last week's storm, and there was
adequate time to communicate with city snow
removal services to coordinate plans for han-
dling the storm. The University should have
made sure that students with disabilities knew
their transportation options. There were days
to plan alternative ways for wheelchair-bound
students to get to their classes, but many stu-
dents still had to miss glass because they were
unable tophysically get there.
Sidewalks in front of academic and residen-
tial buildings need to be a priority for snow

removal. The University should work with
private companies if there is too much snow
to clear. Students should be able to get from
their place of residence to their classes, even
if they are ina wheelchair. It's the University's
responsibility to make sure campus sidewalks
are cleared.
Bad weather is dangerous for all students,
especially those with disabilities. If the side-
walks can't be adequately cleared to allow
every student to attend class safely, the Uni-
versity should close. If the University choos-
es not to close and students are expected to
attend class, they should be able to get there
without endangering themselves. The Univer-
sity remains open because it's not a commuter
school, but it has forgotten that students still
have to brave the weather and walk to class.
Clearing the roads but pushing snow onto the
sidewalks isn't a solution on a campus where
most students - disabled or not - walk to class.
The University has a responsibility to
ensure the safety of students as they make
their way to class. If the University is going
to choose to remain open during times of bad
weather, it needs to do a better job of keeping
the sidewalks clear and helping all students
travel safely to class.

ed on Jan. 24 in the parking lot of
Dearborn's largest mosque, he was
wearing a black ski mask, taking
photos of the mosque and his car
was packed full of "high-end" ille-
gal fireworks.
But news outlets have also
uncovered that Stockham has a his-
tory of mental illness. For example,
he pleaded not guilty by reason of
insanity to threatening the life of
former President George Bush in
2004.
But whether Stockham is a ter-
rorist or simply a lunatic isn't my
concern at the moment. What he did
after his arrest is far more interest-
ing. In court for his arraignment on
Friday, Stockham decided to fire his
court-appointed attorney and asked
the court to appoint him a new one.
It's not an unusual move for defen-
dants to make, but Stockham's rea-
son was unique: He wanted to fire
his attorney, Mark Haidar, because
he claimed Haidar was a Shiite.
It's not clear whether Haidar is
actually a member of the minority
Shiite sect of Islam; it could just be
another voice in Stockham's head.
Regardless, Stockham certainly has
the right to ask the court for a new
lawyer, buthis action raises an inter-
esting conceptual question: If the

court appointed attorney was in fact
a Muslim, should that matter? Can't
a Muslim lawyer fairly represent a
man in Stockham's situation? Or is
the "lawyer" part hopelessly ham-
pered by the "Muslim" part?
Let me be clear about one thing:
Even with the recent spike in anti-
Islamic rhetoric - I'm sure the com-
ments to this column will be a fine
example - being Muslim in America
is actually not that hard. Sure, there
are the crazies who shout epithets
and bully and harass Muslims, but
these are rare instances. The more
important problem I see is subtle:
Muslims in America are being iden-
tified primarily, and only, by their
religion. A nation that has always
accepted outsiders for the common-
alities that make us all Americans
suddenly doesn't give such benefit of
the doubt to Muslims.
A Muslim politician/lawyer/
professor/etc. is seen today by the
average person as a Muslim first,
with everything else faded into an
obliviated backdrop. Regardless
of what the person may be talking
about, there remains a doubt in
even well-meaning people's minds
about the person's true motives. It's
no different from the anti-semitism
that lurked in the world's psyche for
the better part of several centuries,
the anti-Catholic sentiment in this
country that was only overcome
with Kennedy in power or the anti-
black suspicions that still linger in
significant pockets of this nation.
It's natural to fear those who are
different, but America has always
been better than other countries in
understanding that the differences
between cultures and people can be
accepted, and diverse people can live
and work together in a productive
society. This is a precious insight
that much of the world lacks: Just
look at the remnants of the Soviet

Union and Yugoslavia, or the bitter-
ness between India and Pakistan,
where different peoples feel the
need to wall themselves off, to disas-
trous result.
With a few glaring exceptions -
segregation and Japanese intern-
ment, among others - America has
generally been above such polariz-
ing squabbles. But every principle,
no matter how beloved, gets tested.
There will always be a group that
is just a little too different, that we
just aren't comfortable with.
It's natural to
fear those who
are different.
Muslims today are one such
group, but they're not alone. Con-
sidering the baseless questions of
neutrality raised about the (possi-
bly) gay California judge who over-
turned the state's gay marriage ban,
it's clear that Americans aren't yet
very trusting of gay people either.
But why do we assume a gay per-
son can't fairly decide gay issues?
By that standard, Justice Thurgood
Marshall would have had a lot of
explaining to do for every Supreme
Court opinion he ever wrote.
Ideals are defined inthe moments
when they matter. Wilting even for
a second in our enduring belief that
all Americans - regardless of petty
labels - are equally American will
be the defeat of that great ideal.
And it would be a shame to lose
it now, after all we've been through
to protect it.

The real Reagan

Rising tensions, rising prices

Yesterday marked what would have been
the 100th birthday of former President Ron-
ald Reagan. One of the most controversial
- and beloved - presidents in American his-
tory, Reagan is largely unknown aside from
common stereotypes by students our age. His
centennial anniversary allows people to take
a fresh look at the man who was president,
governor, corporate spokesman, union leader,
actor and lifeguard.
Reagan was born in the one-street town of
Tampico, Ill. Without fortune or privilege, he
worked several odd jobs - proudly serving as
the Rock River lifeguard - while dealing with
an alcoholic father. Reagan once recalled com-
ing home from school to find his dad passed out
inthe snowand somberlycarryinghim inside.
After college, Reagan was a sports broad-
caster and then an actor - becoming a B-mov-
ie star for Warner Bros. Entertainment and
working his way up to head the Screen Actors
Guild. He served as a second lieutenant in
World War II and was one of the first offi-
cers to see footage of European concentration
camps, which strengthened his convictions
against totalitarian regimes.
After working for General Electric Com-
pany and making speeches across the coun-
try for free enterprise, Reagan turned his full
attention to politics. Frustrated by the growth
of government and what he saw as a weak
approach to the Soviet Union, Reagan offi-
cially became a Republican in 1962, famously
declaring, "I didn't leave the Democratic
Party. The party left me."
Elected governor of California in 1966, Rea-
gan handled eight years of cultural and eco-
nomic distress. He quelled violent protests
across the University of California campuses
and worked with Democrats in the Legisla-
ture to secure spending cuts in exchange for
tax increases with surpluses refunded to the
taxpayers.
By 1980, America was suffering from
high inflation, stifling unemployment and a
declining reputation. Reagan's presidential
campaign was based onthe ideas that Amer-
ica was a "shining city on a hill" and that a

restrengthening of our military and economic
capabilities was needed to regain the nation's
productive leadership. Running against
incumbent Jimmy Carter, Reagan won 489-
49. In 1984,49 states re-elected him.
Reagan - in conjunction with Chairman of
the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker - quickly set
out to repair America's economy. He negotiat-
ed with a Democratic House to reduce income
taxes - with top marginal rates falling from
70 percent to 28 percent during his tenure.
With deregulation, tight monetary policy and
a push to decrease federal expenditures, infla-
tion fell from 13.9 percent in 1980 to 4 percent
in 1988. Real gross domestic product growth
averaged 4.3 percent annually.
In foreign relations, Reagan focused on
nuclear weapon reductions with the Soviet
Union but understood that America had to
speak from a position of strength. Convinced
the USSR was fundamentally unsustainable,
Reagan pushed a dramatic military build-up.
Having returned the nation to a place of pre-
eminence, Reagan overcame GOP opposition
to secure the Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces Treaty and began what would become
the first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
One hundred years after his birth, Reagan's
legacy remains a dominating force in Ameri-
can politics. He wasn't perfect - Reagan him-
self lamented his inability to cut the national
debt and the Iran-Contra Affair tarnished his
second term - yet he changed the national
conversation on a multitude of issues, promot-
ing individual freedom, expanding economic
opportunity and pursuing peace through
strength.
His life was about more than jelly beans
and cabinet meeting naps. Reagan's rise from
a working class kid to leader of the free world
- and his ability to bring so many others along
with him, in the United States and abroad -
offers inspiration to students facing a weak job
market and uncertainty about the direction of
their lives.

glued to the tele-

DEWITT

vision screens watching the chaos in
a city thousands of miles away, many
people may have missed a direct
consequence of the unrest right here
at home: soaring gas prices.
This past weekend, prices for
gasoline were well over $3 per gal-
lon around Ann Arbor, and the story
is the same throughout much of
the country. A member of Kuwait's
Supreme Petroleum Council said
yesterday that the turmoil in Egypt
could push oil prices to over $110 per
barrel, according to a Feb. 6 Reuters
article.
These price increases shed light
on how fragile the international oil
market is. Oil prices aren't going up
because of an actual change in the
market. They're going up because
of anxieties about a potential change
in the market. The protests in Egypt
threaten the stability of the entire
Middle East region. And disregard-
ing the danger this poses to all the
civilians caught in the middle of
these disputes, any changes in the
stability of the region could make
getting oil at a "reasonable" price,
or getting it to the United States at
all, extremely difficult. That is why
prices are going up. Oil companies
want to prepare for there to be a real
reason for them to go up.

What's arguably most absurd
about the situation is that Egypt
barely produces anyoil, and yet their
political volatility is able to com-
pletely shake up the entire Middle
East oil industry. The biggest tangi-
ble threat is that Egypt could cut the
flow of the Suez Canal oil pipeline
that passes near Cairo. But while
this canal is functioning properly
despite the country's unrest, the fear
of what could happen is enough to
raise prices.
While Americans have been riv-
eted by the images they've seen on
the news of the chaos in Egypt, the
United States's involvement in the
country's struggle has been, by most
standards, minimal. And given that
domestic gas prices are still on the
rise despite our nation's relative neu-
tralityit's in our best interest that we
stay out of it. Many people have been
calling for a more serious response
from President Barack Obama, but it
makes sense that he is staying mum.
You can't go into a business meeting
pushing and shoving, and Egypt's
government is a business client for
the U.S. and it's important that we
remain on good terms with this cli-
ent no matter who's in charge. As far
as the nation is concerned, democ-
racy in the Middle East is good, but
cheap oil is better.
The situation in Egypt is by no
means the first international issue
that has threatened the stability of
U.S. gas prices. Yet we never learn.
While candidate after candidate has
campaigned on the platform of end-
ing America's dependency on foreign
oil, we're nowhere near reaching
that goal. Any progress we have
made toward economic recovery will
be derailed if Americans are consis-
tently paying $3.25 per gallon for
gasoline and heating their homes at
unmanageable costs. The U.S. needs
energy reform now. The business

as usual of crossing our fingers and
hoping that Middle Eastern leaders
like Americans enough to do reason-
able business with us isn't working.
And as we saw from the summer's
BP oil spill, the domestic oil market
isn't working too well either.
Egypt is showing
the weakness in
the oil market.
As far as the environmental
aspect of the issue, we're actually
moving backward. Sen. John Bar-
rasso (R-WY) has introduced a bill
that would keep the Environmental
Protection Agency from regulating
carbon emissions. This bill would
prevent the federal government
from doing anything to get Ameri-
ca's carbon footprint under control.
And if we're under no obligation to
reduce our carbon emissions, we
have no reason to make real efforts
to shake our dependency on oil.
Egypt is moving toward a solu-
tion to its conflict, and as things
calm down, oil prices will decrease
and the world will move on. But the
U.S. can't afford to return to com-
placency. We need to start invest-
ing in renewable energy options
and think seriously about the envi-
ronmental impact of our lifestyle.
Our use of petroleum and our role
in the market currently operates at
an unsustainable level, and we need
to make adjustments sooner rather
than later.

'Blue' a mixed Affair

"Omigod ... You're supposed to hang a sock."

Horror in the, halls

By JOE DIMUZIO
Daily Arts Writer
Let's face it. Half the fans of
Hercules and Love Affair's self-
titled, critically adored, unapolo-
getically gay
debut never

But for those who danced,
HALA's debut proved to be more
than just a good album. Producer
and writer Andy Butler's retro-
but-not jams managed to occupy
two of disco's best qualities: a
damn good groove and that dark
realization that all the great times
in the world would never save
you from the future. In the con-
text of gay dance music, it felt like
some cosmic epitaph with Antony
Hegarty as torch-bearing mater-
familias, leadingthe march to the
next party - dancing and crying
at the same time.
Hercules and Love Affair's
sophomore Blue Songs decides
to pick up that torch, which was
apparently dropped in Chicago
right around 1985-87. While the
debut hinted at it, Blue Songs
makes early house its modus ope-
randi, with the sort of forward-

The point of this film is not to sit

While Kelly doesn't do too
impressive a job as an inno-

effectiveness hinges less on her
performance than on Meester's,
who, surprisingly, plays a pretty

ROOMMATE
From Page 5A
sets her apart from the other
vain, slutty girls Kelly hangs out
with. So, when she first starts
attacking the assholes in Kelly's
life, you're almost rooting for
her. And you keep rooting for
her until you see what she does
to Kelly's adopted kitten, "Cud-
dles." It's around that point you
realize just how sick Meester's
character is and what she's capa-
ble of on her quest to insulate her
roommate from everything out-
side of their relationship.
The only reason this oth-
erwise promising movie isn't
better is its newcomer direc-
tor, Christian E. Christiansen.
Apparently he's made movies in
Denmark well enough for him to
try an English-language film, but
it sometimes feels like this movie

has no director at all. Random
shots are canted throughout the
film as if Christiansen is paying
homage to ... someone else who
wasn't sure what canted shots
were for. It's like he's saying, "I
saw a horror film once," but you
seriously don't believe him. Most
importantly, there are about a
dozen pointless, weird pans and
dramatic zoom-ins that resemble
home movies where it's clear dad
was just trying to see what all the
buttons on the side of the camera
were for.
In fairness, most movies that
try to depict college kids and col-
lege situations have a hard time
doingso without looking like they
were directed by your mom. But,
because of how good-looking this
entire cast is - and how unset-
tling Meester's performance
becomes - we're distracted
enough from this movie's poor
directing to make it worth seeing.

Commercial interception
Why the Super Bowl's ads are simply more
awesome than the football game
By Jacob Axelrad I Daily Arts Writer

Six days ago, Google
unleashedits newest
virtual data-sharing jug-
gernaut: the infinitely alluring,
excellently designed and over-
all beautiful Art Project. It's
awesome.
Seriously, if
you haven't
checked it
out yet, do
so immedi-
ately.
Art Proj-
ect offers LEAH
anyone with BURGIN
an Internet
connection
access to select galleries and art-
works in17 of the world's most
prolific museums. Using Street
View technology (familiar to
the iber-creepers who frequent
Google Maps for not purely
direction-seeking purposes),
the Art Project allows art lov-
ers and novices alike to stroll
through such institutions as the
Uffizi Gallery in Florence, The
Museum of Modern Art and The
Metropolitan Museum of Art in
NewYork City, The State Her-
mitage Museumin St. Peters-
burg and the National Gallery
and Tate Modern in London.
But that's not all. The paint-
ings are presented in a super
gigapixel technology that
allows users to zoom into a
minute magnification and see
such fine detail as thick golden
paint blobs on Van Gogh's The
Starry Night and cracks in
Rembrandt's canvasses. It's the
kind of view that, until now,
only conservators and the actu-
al artist have been privileged
enough to see. i
Whilethere has been some
moderately controversial buzz
surrounding the ownership
implications of Google's lat-
est baby - for example, once
a piece of artwork no longer
technicallybngs to anart-
ist and is released to the public
domain, who really "owns"
it? - the main question on my
mind is, how will this awe-
inspiring innovation impact the
museum world?
From the inception of the
museum concept in the world
of the ancient Greeks to the
most contemporary institutions
like the Heidelberg Project,
museums have been dealing
with an ongoing debate: Should
they emulate a "temple" aes-
thetic, creating a space for indi-
viduals to come and stand in
awe of great works and inspir-
ingartifacts, or should they
be a more accessible "forum"
for constituents of every con-
ceivable backgroundto come
together and exchange ideas?
To date, most museums aim to
reach a compromise between
both goals. And most do a good
job with the balancing act.
Art Project definitely embod-
ies the philosophy behind the
forum sector of museology.
People can create individual art
collections - sign in with your
Google account, zoom in on
your favorite painting and save
snippet views of an artwork (or
the entire piece) into your col-
lection. According to an infor-
mational video, this part of the
project is intended to jumpstart
discussion and allow users to

share whatthey discover with
their various social networks.
This is the ultimate application
of the forum mindset: Not only
do individuals get to interact
directly with art, they also are
able to manipulate it. Art is no
longer something dissected
only bysnooty art historians we
all find insufferable (love you,
Mom). It's a layman's conversa-
tion point. And, as abudding
museologist, I believe that's
exactly as it should be.
Furthermore, I think Art
Project will inspire more
people to travel to more muse-
ums. Yes - in amuseum, you
can't see the artwork in super
hi-def ortour a building from
the comfort of a desk chair,
but there's another piece of
museumlore that works in con-
junction with the Art Project
to make increased museum
attendance a very probable
outcome. It's called the "aura of
the original."
Now we can
stalk museums.
Walter Benjamin, the intel-
lectual who devised this theory,
posited that an object's aura is
the often-intangible aspects
that are "left over" after dupli-
cation. For example, author-
ship, history and sensorial
experiences are not transferred
from original to copy. With Art
Project, I can't stand before a
canvas personally primed and
painted by Van Gogh. I can't
get Starry Night's sense of "old-
ness" through the instant and
constantly updating Internet.
The masterpiece is over 120
years old, but on a computer
screen, the paint could have
dried ten minutes ago.. An4I
can't smellithe indescribable
Van Gogh-y scent of Starry
Night. Art Project can offer me
a lot, but it can't offer every-
thing. That's where museums
come in: They provide the
originals. And the aura pro-
duced by the originals is why
these works are valued and
revered - and whythey're held
in museums in the first place.
Art Project emphasizes the
differences between original
artworks and duplications, and
makes the authentic pieces
even more special and prized
by society.
Right now, Art Project can
only expand. More museums
will hopefully get on board and
more galleries and paintings
will hopefully be added. If an
individual can't make it to a
foreign museum, I can't imag-
ine a better way to experience
art than through Google's new
project. And, consequently, I
wouldn't be surprised if Art
Project turns many people
into active museum visitors.
The museum nerd that I am, I
can't wait to see how museums
further utilize this tool in the
future. It's goingto be a great,
era of virtual opportunity.

I'll be honest. I know nothing
about football. I'm ashamed to
say it was only a snippet of pass-
ing conversation that taught me
who'd be playing in Arlington,
Tex. yesterday. Yet my inad-
equate knowledge of the sport
doesn't prevent me from looking
forward to Super Bowl Sunday
for 364 days out of the year. The
reason for this is simple: I love
the advertisements. I'm proud to
say that I'm a Super Bowl com-
mercial junkie.
It's on Super Bowl day that
advertisers are willing to pay
upwards of millions of dollars.
The most-watched television
event of the year in the U.S.,
and second worldwide only to
the European UEFA Champions
final, can garner around three
million dollars for spots lasting
in the neighborhood of 30 sec-
onds to two minutes. That's crazy
- and that's just to get the ad on
the air!
ButI suppose this aspect of the
Super Bowl is an accepted and
expected part of the zeitgeist, so
let this be more of a discussion
about what makes these commer-
cials just so entertaining.
First, there are the cameos.
Recent Super Bowl commercials
have featured Betty White as a
Snickers-chomping touch foot-
ball player, Christopher Reeve in
a spot for Nuveen Investments,
Larry Bird and Michael Jordan in

a showdown for a McDonald's Big
Mac and Carlos Mencia as a teach-
er instructing a class of English-
language learners on the many
ways to order a Bud Light. Let's
not forget the Budweiser Clydes-
dale commercials. (Those don't
have a celebrity in them per se,
but those horses give some pretty
unforgettable performances.)
The point is that it's in com-
panies' best interests to produce
commercials that grab our atten-
tion. They want something that'll
force us to see what they have
to sell, even if the actual ad has
nothing to do with the product
being sold. The "Alien" FedEx
commercial comes to mind - this
was the one with an alien (going
by the name "Jenkins") from the
1979 film of the same name who
sits behind a shipping counter,
politely suggesting that the com-
pany switch to FedEx.
The history of these ads dates
back to the early '80s, when Rid-
ley Scott directed a high-concept
commercial for the debut of the
first Macintosh computer. The ad
(which aptly aired in 1984) por-
trays a dystopian society, com-
plete with dreary, dark tunnels,
uniformed marching and a Big
Brother figure lecturing an audi-
ence of mindless drones straight
out of Orwell's novel. It concludes
with a woman running into the
auditorium and hurling a ham-
mer at the screen, disturbing the

"Stop, in the name of love."
ritual. The screen cuts to black
and the words roll: "On January
24th Apple Computer will intro-
duce Macintosh. And you'll see
why 1984 won't be like '1984.' "
While it generated a fair share
of controversy, the ad paved the
way for the Super Bowl commer-
cials we know today: expensive
advertisements that continu-
ally push the envelope in artistry,
budget and content.
Of course, there is the ques-
tion of ethics. We are, after all,
watching giant corporations
shell out millions of dollars with
the sole goal of loosening view-
ers' purse strings. Yes, I do have
qualms about this. And no, the
subject matter doesn't generally
go much further than light beer.
As far as I can tell the only coun-
terargument to this mentality is

that some of the commercials just
happen to beso damn good - the
Budweiser Frogs are pure genius
in my book.
So this brings us to 2011, Super
Bowl XLV. I understand that
Pittsburgh played Green Bay, and
I also understand that that's a big
deal. But my eyes were drawn to
the TV only during those minutes
between play, when the game
momentarily stopped for a com-
mercial break. It already appears
that we have some contenders to
take their place in history next to
the greats - Volkswagen's 2011
Beetle, Angry Birds and Volk-
swagen's Darth Vader ad, to name
a few. Super Bowl winners come
and go, but these ,commercials
make history. Well, at least they
give me a reason to look forward
to this football game every year.

Only 3-D effects keep 'Sanctum'
from sinking into predictability

By WILL DEFEBAUGH-..
For the Daily
"What could possibly go wrong
diving in caves?" posits lead
female and inexperienced diver
Victoria (Alice
Parkinson, *
"X-Men Origins:
Wolverine") at Sanctum
the beginning
of James Cam- At Quality 16
eron's latest and Rave
3-D spectacle, Universa
"Sanctum." U
A lot, appar-
ently....
Based on the true story of co-
writer Andrew Wight, "Sanctum"
follows a group of cave divers that
gets trapped in one of the world's
largest unexplored cave systems
after a freak rainstorm collapses
the entrance and begins flooding
the entire cave. With the knowl-
edge that the system does reach
the ocean at some point, the ini-
tial survivors attempt to explore
the depths against the clock.
Leading the charge is diver
and hard-ass extraordinaire
Frank (Richard Roxburgh, "Mou-
lin Rouge"). With members of
his party dying at nearly every
turn, Frank is not afraid to make
cutthroat decisions that create
unrest with the other survivors -
namely, with his son, Josh (Rhys
Wakefield, "Home and Away").
Forced to accompany his father

on expeditions for the one month
a year they're together, Josh
resents his father, not under-
standing the latter's fascination
with underground exploration,
which he chose over his family
long ago. While the film does live
up to its suspense-thriller sub-
title, it is the cliched resolution
of this misunderstood father-son
relationship in extreme circum-
stances that ends up being the
focus of the film.
That and the stunning under-
water 3-D visual experience, of
course. While Cameron received
some backlash when he told
Entertainment Weekly that
every film would be better in 3-D
("Twilight?" "Mean Girls 2?"), if
ever a movie were made to be in
3-D, it's "Sanctum."
Not only does the advanced 3-D
technology (originally developed
in 2007 for Cameron's "Avatar")
make for breathtaking underwa-
ter imagery, it also makes view-
ers really feel like they're there
in the caves. For a movie about
being trapped underwater, this is
unnerving.
One of the first lessons the div-
ers learn is that their worst enemy
- even worse than the water, lack
of oxygen, spear-like stalagmites
and bone-crunching boulders -
is panic. Divers become seized

OXFORD

lighting in the Oxford Road area
in response to the recent crimi-
nal activity.
"My goal is to use the petition
as a student voice to show the
people that matter that students
are really upset about this and
that they're willing to do some-
thing about it," Rosenberg said.
She added that members of the
Greek community have been vic-
tims of the recent crimes.
"So far in the last two months,
the robberies have been on Greek
students, so I think there has
been an initial outcry from the
Greek community ..." Rosenberg
said. "Everyone is a little con-
cerned, especially with the den-
sity of Greek houses that are in
that area."

While many Greek commu-
nity members have signed the
petition, Rosenberg said it has
also received interest from other
students and Ann Arbor resi-
dents, particularly those living
in the Oxford area. Though there
is no specific goal for a signature
count, she said the petition is a
way for the Greek community to
unite and raise awareness about
the issue.
"(The petition) really got the
word out to a lotof people that the
Greek community is interested in
doing something about this as a
group," Rosenberg said. "I've had
a lot of people contact me to get
involved with working with the
city and brainstorming ideas."
As a result, Rosenberg said
she plans to start a Greek hous-
ing safety committee composed
of Greek life house managers
and other members in the near

future.'
At the meetings, members
would brainstorm ways to pro-
tect themselves and gener-
ate ideas for improving safety,
Rosenberg said.
Public Policy junior Steve
Zuckerman, a Public Policy rep-
resentative for the Michigan Stu-
dent Assembly and a member of
Alpha Delta Phi fraternity locat-
ed on South Forest, said when
he heard about the Lighting Ini-
tiative, he brought the issue to
MSA.
"My big thing with MSA is to
address things that are a concern
to the students, and clearly, this
is a really strong concern," Zuck-
erman said.
However, not all residents in
the area see lighting as the main
issue.
Billy Joe Evans, professor
emeritus of chemistry at the Uni-

versity, has lived in the Oxford
Road area near campus for the
last 40 years. He said he and his
wife aren't concerned about the
burglaries occurring in the area,
and the lighting is not problem-
atic for them.
"I think the lighting is fine,"
Evans said.
He added that increase in
crime may be attributed to near-
by fraternity parties that "bring
in bad elements" since the frater-
nities don't monitor who comes
into their houses.
Tom Bence, president of Delta
Chi fraternity located at 1705
Hill St., said the house has been
broken into twice during this
academic year and since then,
the residents have increased
security measures.
"We have taken preventa-
tive actions like having better
exterior doors, but the robber-

ies have come through windows
and during parties where people
break into individuals' rooms, so
we find it hard to defend against
that," Bence said.
Bence said though the burglar-
ies may have occurred because
the residents were "distracted"
while parties were going on, the
crimes didn't happen because
there were unknown people in
the house for a party.
"It's as a result of us having a
party, but it's not the people that
we invite into our house that are
robbing us," Bence said.
Flocken said students should
travel in pairs when walking
home, especially between the
hours of 11 p.m. and 2 a.m., since
this is the time when most of the
crimes have occurred. However,
many students say they have
instead opted not to walk in the
area at all when it's dark outside.

LSA sophomore Alexander
Capobianco, a member of Zeta
Beta Tau fraternity located on
Oxford Road, said most people
he knows now takes cabs or find
rides from others, adding that
he doesn't let friends walk home
alone at night. The Zeta Beta
Tau house has also added new
locks to the doors and increased
lighting around the outside of
house.
LSA sophomore Kathleen
Metz, president of the Delta
Gamma sorority, also located on
Oxford Road, said sorority mem-
bers who live in the house have
also been avoiding walking in the
area at night.
"Pretty much every single girl
in my house right now, after it
gets dark outside, is afraid to
walk home alone ... and I'm pret-
ty sure it's the same for a lot of
other sororities," Metz said.


TOWSLEY
From Page 1A
House, said this is because Eng-
lish is a second language for
many of the children, and their
language skills are still develop-
ing.
"Some (toddlers and pre-
schoolers) speak two languages,
some three," Blanchard said.
"It's always astonishing how
quicklythey learn English."
Because members of the
University community receive
priority for their children's
enrollment, Blanchard said the
diversity of infants, toddlers and
preschoolers is representative
of University faculty, staff and
graduate students.
As Blanchard was talking, the
pigtailed girl approached again,
smiling and pantomiming an
exaggerated shiver, her knees
wiggling just below an orange-
and-white flaring skirt.
"It's just so cold. It's like
polar bear winter," she said once
again, running off as Blanchard
responded with a smile.
Blanchard pointed out the
window to the spot where Vil-

lage Corner, the longtime cam-
pus convenience store, was
recently demolished.
"Children are loving watch-
ing the construction," she said,
adding that they take occasional
field trips across the street to see
the site.
The pigtailed girl reappeared
once again.
"It's just so cold. It's just like
polar bear winter," she said.
"Good thing you have your hat
on to keep you warm," Blanchard
responded.
But Towsley offers more than
an early education for children.
It also allows University stu-
dents hands-on experience for
research.
University students from Psy-
chology 307: Practicum in Child
Development and Child Care
assist Towsley teachers for first-
hand, research-based experience
in developmental psychology.
LSA senior Amy Schoenherr
is volunteering at Towsley this
semester after working there in
the fall as well.
"The goal is to see themgrow,"
Schoenherr said, referring to the
children she observes.
Each Psych 307 student is

assigned to a classroom to work
with infants, toddlers or pre-
schoolers ranging from ages one
month to 5.5 years old. Schoen-
herr assists professional teachers
in a classroom of toddlers aged 15
months to 2.5 years old. I
"Our class is very, very much
about the children. What they
want and what they need, we
really try to fulfill," Schoenherr
said.
Nursing students and Uni-
versity students in Alpha Delta
Pi sorority located next door
to Towsley also help out at the
children's center. Kinesiol-
ogy students occasionally teach
physical education courses as
well, Blanchard said.
She added that because of the
Psych 307 course, University vol-
unteers are mostly psychology
students.
Schoenherr said the practi-
cum course focuses on teaching
University students about con-
flicts in the classroom as well as
the benefits of play and why poli-
cies about child development and
preschool programs exist.
"What we see in the class-
room, we put into (a) paper,"
Schoenherr said.

Schoenherr said one essay she
wrote for her psychology class
addressed separation anxiety
and the struggles young children
have when their parents drop
them off in the morning.
"They're learning to play
together, which is shocking
because kids are egocentric,"
Schoenherr said. "It's something
that is hard for them, but they've
definitely come a long way."
Play-based programs, Schoen-
herr said, are often miscon-
strued.
"People think all they do is
play, but they're really learn-
ing a lot," she said, adding that
play-based programs have been
shown to benefit child develop-
ment through the "very stimulat-
ing" nature of the programs.
"We teach gross-motor skills,
fine-motor skills, language, the
simple stuff like colors, numbers,
the alphabet. They love music.
They love to paint and color,"
Schoenherr said, adding that the
kids also enjoy being read to.
After taking the practicum
last semester, LSA senior Alexia
Simons, who works with the tod-
dler age group, also decided to
stick around this semester. She

now works at Towsley for her
paid work-study job.
"It helps me to know that I do
want to work with kids," Simons
said
Simons said caring for the
children is structured but sur-
prising.
"It's something new every
day," she said. "It's fun work
because you don't know what to
expect. There's a schedule, but
there's different activities every-
day."
Projects from the Psych 307
students andthe youngsters cover
the walls and ceilings of Towsley.
Both Schoenherr and Simons
said the children's learning
motor and language skills are
a vital part of the Towsley cur-
riculum. Teaching the kids to
walk and talk can be challenging,
Schoenherr said, but it has really
taught her the value of patience.
"Language acquisition - how
much they are able to express
themselves and their wants -
that's really most shocking," she
said.
Children entering the program
typically aren't at ease around
other children, Simons said.
"Some of them didn'ttalk alot,.

weren't that comfortable," she
said. "A lot of them, this is the
first time with students of their
age."
But With time and help from
the practicum students, the chil-
dren start to open up.
"(It's) crazy in that we can
get a group of 10 to 12 toddlers
to actually sit and sing songs
(together)," Schoenherr said.
"It's just amazing what some of
these kids are capable of doing
and how young they really are."
One afternoon before recess,
three preschoolers march out
in a single file line and sit on a
bench in a hall of Towsley. A
teacher ties their shoes. Bundled
up in snow gear, they then march
outside.
A girl drags around a purple
sled. A boy watches two girls
swing. A bench shaped like a but-
terfly remains empty, surround-
ed by fresh snow. From the top of
a mushroom-shaped fountain, a
teacher reaches for an icicle for
a child. A boy sits alone on a pile
of snow, hands in his lap, watch-
ing a teacher chase around three
children, all three fighting to
keep balance, toddling through
the snow.


SURVEILLANCE
From Page 1A
ports the idea behind the project.
"(I thought) that at Ann Arbor
Dems, we needed to be at the
forefront of a progressive idea,
and that was the reason why we
decided to support (Leaf) and
move this along," Hall-Thiam
said.
While the Ann Arbor Demo-
crats have officially endorsed
the ordinance, Cleveland Chan-
dler, the chair of the Washtenaw
County Democratic Party, said a
conversation about the surveil-

lance ordinance is on the agenda
for his group's next meeting on
Feb. 15.
"We've discussed it, but we
haven't endorsed it yet," he said.
Leaf said the club also has to
wait for the city attorney to fin-
ish evaluating the ordinance and
for the Ann Arbor City Coun-
cil to vote on it before the ordi-
nance could become a law. The
city council process could take a
while to complete, he explained.
"We're going to have to talk
to every city council person first
to see where they're at and see
what they feel about it, and then
we have to get a sponsor on City

Council, and they present it in the
first hearing, and then two weeks
later they vote on it," Leaf said.
City Council member Sabra
Briere (D-Ward 1) said she
thinks it will be difficult for Leaf
to get a City Council member to
bringthe ordinance before coun-
cil. Though she agrees with the
idea behind the proposed ordi-
nance, Briere said she thinks
the wording of the proposal and
bringing it up before City Coun-
cil will make members choose to
implement cameras in areas they
wouldn't otherwise.
"Personally, I don't want sur-
veillance cameras anywhere

in Ann Arbor, and I worry that
opening a door to an ordinance
of this nature would allow sur-
veillance cameras," Briere said.
The main challenge the group
has faced, Leaf said, has been
getting people interested in the
topic because it is not heavily
publicized or controversial.
"The idea that there's no pri-
vacy in public has just kind of been
accepted by people and not really
thought about," he said. "We're
just really trying to change peo-
ple's basic ideas about the subject
and get people interested."
He explained that American
deserve privacy in public and all

aspects of daily and recreational
life.
"It's really important to say
that our public spaces aren't
just the Times Square," he said.
"Public spaces are also every
park, every beach and every
residential neighborhood. And
to just give up all privacy in all
these places would make our
lives worse."
Leaf, who grew up in Ann
Arbor, said his passion about pri-
vacy comes from his dedication
to protecting the environment.
"To me, there's no such thing
as wilderness when every area
in an entire city is under surveil-

lance all the time," he said.
Leaf attended Pioneer High
School, which began using sur-
veillance cameras while Leaf
was a senior there. He said that
was the first time he voiced his
opposition to the cameras, and it
has since been an ongoing battle.
"For me, the biggest thing is
just being able to walk around
the city I live in without being
under constant surveillance,"
he said. "And constant surveil-
lance isn't in some science fiction
realm, its already happening."

SOLAR PANEL
From Page 1A
because he didn't have a source of
light.
"Growing up I didn't have any
lighting. I had to actually study
under kerosene lamps, using can-
dlelight or sometimes just going
to huddle around street lights to
study," Traore said. "I knew that
(education) was (the) only key
thing for me because ... I came
from a low class family and chanc-
es are most of us wouldn't make it
to college."
Amin, who was born in Bangla-
desh, said the solar panel project
was partially inspired by a family
friend who asked him to develop
a lighting system for a village in
West Africa. The friend, who vis-
ited the village, told Amin about
the need for a clean energy system
to alleviate certain difficulties for
the residents.
Following his conversation
with the family friend, Amin said
he sought Traore's help, and they
began working on the project.
Traore and Aminsaid they worked
on an initial design, but itprovedto
be too expensive for the village.
Traore said the idea for a por-
table solar panel was motivated
by an incident in which he had
difficulty contacting his mother,
who lives in Mali. Traore said
his mother hadn't been able to
find electricity to charge her cell
phone when she went to a village
to visit someone and was forced
to travel to another village miles

away.
"That was very inconvenient,
and I wasn't happy with that -
so everything started coming
together and I said, 'I would like
to design a portable solar energy
system for villages in developing
countries,"' Traore said.
When Amin entered the Uni-
versity as an Engineering gradu-
ate student, he and Traore began
submitting their design to sev-
eral clean energy competitions -
many of which they won.
"We were really excited and
we thought ... this could actually
work," Amin said.
With the grant money they
earned from the competitions,
Amin and Traore proceeded to
build a prototype of their design.
"We had the money to build
something, and so we built some-
thing off the shelf (that) we could
stick together using a wooden
box and whatever we could find,"
Amin said. "It went from a con-
cept to something that we could
actually carry around. It could
power your laptop, but it looked
like a shoebox."
Amin attributed some of his
and Traore's success to their
continuing involvement with the
TechArb. They became involved
with the TechArb - a partnership
between the College of Engineer-
ing's Center for Entrepreneurship
and the Ross School of Business's
Zell Lurie Institute - last sum-
mer. The TechArb gives entre-
preneurs 24-hour access to work
space and opportunities to net-
work with fellow entrepreneurs,

according to Doug Neal, man-
aging director of the Center for
Entrepreneurship.
What distinguished June Ener-
gy from other companies in the
TechArb was Amin and Traore's
personal connection to their
product, Neal said.
"The June Energy team had a
very compelling personal experi-
ence with the target market that
they're trying to solve the prob-
lem at," he said.
"The fact that they were devel-
oping a very effective solution for
customers ... through their own
efforts and education is a very
good story and very compelling
proposition on how they would
be successful during their time at
TechArb," Neal said.
Amin said though it was some-
times difficult to balance school
and the project, he still felt com-
pelled to work on it.
"I always put this company as
my capstone project," Amin said.
"It was the one project in school
that I had to succeed at."
June Energy plans to keep pro-
ducing technology in Ann Arbor U
because of connections with Uni-
versity alumni, Amin said.
"We're really focused on pro-
ducing it locally in Michigan
because there's such a strong net-
work and relationships with local
product manufacturers," he said.
"We don't know in the future,
but we definitely know one thing
- Michigan is very good at man-
ufacturing these things at high
quality and at (a) very competitive
cost."

Wolverines comeback,
grab fourth Big Ten win

By ZAK PYZIK
Daily Sports Editor
STATE COLLEGE - After the Michi-
gan men's basketball team topped Penn
State 65-62 at the Bryce Jordan Center on
Sunday, sophomore guard Darius Morris
embraced Michigan coach John Beilein
in the tunnel.
"(Coach) just said to give him a hug,"
Morris said. "He
was just happy, MICHIGAN 65
he's pleased with PENN STATE 62
how I played, how
we played. To get a win on the road is
really tough to come by in this league."
Morris scored a team-high 23 points
to help the Wolverines (4-7 Big Ten,
14-10 overall) finish the season sweep of
the Nittany Lions. In the first half, Mor-
ris seemed to be the only one able to do

anything offensively. But toward the end,
Morris was accidentally elbowed while
defending and fell hard to the ground.
"I don't know (what) happened," Mor-
ris said. "I got hit, and it really, really
hurt. The (referee) really said I got hit. So
I just wanted to check my head to make
sure I didn'thave any concussion."
Morris was slow to get up from the
hardcourt, so the referee called an
injury timeout as Morris stayed on the
ground holding his head. As soon as the
whistle blew, Morris popped up as if
nothing had happened and was heckled
as if he had faked the injury. The heck-
ling continued into the second half and
served as motivation for Morris and the
Wolverines.
"I didn't want to show any weakness
to them or to my teammates," Morris

Michigan tops Fighting Illini

I cheered for
Woodson on
Super Sunday.

O nthis Super Bowl Sun-
day, a day full of athletic
pageantry and a pure
American love of sports, I can't
help but look
back at my
first vivid
sports mem-
ory..
I was eight
years old,
and I had, in =
that moment, x
almost instan- RYAN
taneously KARTJE
decided who
my favorite
athlete of all time would be. He
wore No.2. I had just watched
him make an electrifying punt
return and intercept a pass near
Michigan's endzone against Ohio
State.
And as the game came to end
- my dad jumping up and down
in our living room - he iconi-
cally put the rose in his mouth,
giving me a memory I would
never forget.
Sure, I didn't know what that
meant more than many other
eight-year-olds around, but I
knew who my favorite football
player was. And I knew that
Charles Woodson had made me a
Michigan fan.
Thirteen years later, Woodson
is still my favorite athlete of all
time. His defensive presence on
Michigan's 1997 National Cham-
pionship team is, in my opinion,
the most dominant season by a
defensive player in the history of
college - and maybe even pro-
fessional - football.
And as we embark on the most
exciting and important day in
all of sports (sorry, but there's
no arguing this), I feel it's my
civic duty to honor one of the
best Michigan football players
of all time and one of the best
cornerbacks in the history of the
National Football League on his
second Super Bowl Sunday.
Woodson is a remnant of what
Michigan football, and football
in general, used to be.
If you take a look at the statis-
tical breakdown from the 1997
Wolverine team, you'll under-
stand what I mean.
Brian Griese, the quarterback
of Michigan's national champi-
onship team only threw for 2,293
yards and 17 touchdowns in the
Wolverines' magical season. For
comparison's sake, that would
rank him 42nd nationally in
passing yards and touchdowns in
2010. So, think Wisconsin quar-
terback Scott Tolzein. And yeah,
how many of you would see Tol-
zein asa national championship
quarterback?
Chris Howard, the running
back of Michigan's national
championship team, would've
been 45th nationally in rush-
ing yards and 47th nationally in
touchdowns if he played in 2010
with 938 yards and seven touch-
downs to lead the Wolverines.
Those are numbers quarterback
Denard Robinson almost doubled
this season.
Those offensive numbers
probably wouldn't hold up in

today's NCAAfootball landscape.
But a quick look at the defense,
led by Mr. Woodson, shows that
the moniker of "defense wins
championships" absolutely rang
true in 1997.
The Wolverines had five first
team All-Big Ten defensive
starters - three of which were
also first team All-Americans.
They allowed just 8.8 yards per
completion, still an NCAA FBS
record (Thanks, Charles), led the
Big Ten in total defense (222.8
yards per game) and allowed just
9.5 points per game. Those last
two marks haven't been beaten in
the Big Ten in the last quarter of
a century.
And on that defense - boast-
ing future NFLers James Hall,
Glen Steele, Sam Sword, Dhani
Jones, Ian Gold, Tommy Hen-
dricks, Marcus Ray and William
James - Woodson was the most
feared of all.
A great deal was made of
Woodson's matchup in that 1997
Ohio State game with David
Boston, one of the NCAA's most
dominant wide receivers at the
time. But Woodson was far from
intimidated. He and Boston
exchanged jibes all week long,
and unlike any Michigan player
since, he came through on all of
his guarantees.
There's one
player who has
renewed my
love for football.
Aside from a late 56-yard
touchdown catch, Boston was
held to just two catches for 12
yards total. And like any great
cornerback, Woodson spent
much of the day getting inside
his head.
"The first time I jammed
him and told him he was soft,"
Woodson said of Boston. "Every
time I lined up against him, I
told him nothing would come
easy. I was like a father chastis-
ing his son for running his mouth
to the wrong people. He made
one catch for a touchdown, it
was a great catch. Except for the
touchdown I gave up, it's the all-
around game I wanted."
At Michigan, Woodson repre-
sented everything that football
should be: hard-nosed defense,
mild trash talk, big plays and no-
excuses results. It's something
the Wolverines haven't seen in
awhile, and something Michi-
gan fans should hope for as the
regime changes.
So I'll be rooting for the Pack-
ers on Super Bowl Sunday - even
though the game will be long
over by the time you read this.
Because as much as I love
the Steelers' Lamarr Woodley,
there's one player who has, on
multiple occasions, renewed my
love for the game of football.
And that's Charles Woodson.

It would be difficult to think
of a worse way for the Michi-
gan women's basketball team
to start off the game on Sunday
against Illinois.
After winning the tip, the
Fighting Illini had the ball for
64 seconds
straight, ILINOIS 59
fueled MICHIGAN 69
by an
unheard-of five offensive
rebounds in one possession. On
its fifth try, Illinois finally con-
verted the first bucket of the
game.
"When there's five offensive
rebounds off the bat, you figure,
'Oh boy, here we go,"' Michigan
coach Kevin Borseth said after
the game. "But fortunately the
game is 40 minutes long, not 50
seconds."
Led by senior guard Veronica
Hicks' 24 points, the Wolverines
eventually recovered from the
horrendous start en route to a
69-59 victory over visiting Illi-
nois.
But it took Michigan (7-4 Big
Ten, 14-9 overall) some time to
get going.
Three minutes into the con-
test, Illinois led 7-0 and the Wol-
verines had barely even touched
the ball.
That's when Hicks took over.
She went on an a tear, scoring
Michigan's first eight points of
the game. The Fighting Illini
(2-9, 7-17) simply didn't have a
way to stop her.
"My teammates did a great
job of moving the ball around
and found me a couple of times,"
Hicks said. "I was able to get to
the rima couple of times and fin-
ish, unlike last game."
Hicks darted in and out of the

Illinois defense with ease, fin-
ishing nearly every shot she took
- both in and outside the arc.
She finished the first half with
18 points - just six away from
her career high for a game.
But she wasn't completely
alone in the first frame. With
junior guard Courtney Boylan
struggling, sophomore forward
Kate Thompson was called on
earlier than usual.
"We needed to get a bigger
hand on (Illinois guard Amber
Moore)," Borseth said. "(Moore)
got a couple shots off early on us,
so we put Kate out there. She got
a hand up and blocked a couple
shots, and then altered a bunch
because of her length."
Thompson was successful on
the offensive end, too. She went
into the break with 8 points on
3-for-4 shooting from the field.
With Hicks and Thompson
leading the way, Michigan head-
ed into the locker room with a
38-29 advantage.
For much of the second half,
Illinois wouldn't go away. Every
time it seemed like the Wolver-
ines were on the verge of pulling
away, the Illini responded with
a bucket.
And after Illinois sophomore
forward Karisma Penn, who
torched the Wolverines for 23
points and 11 rebounds, hit a'
free throw with 9:21 remaining,
Michigan's 10-point lead was
down to just two.
That was the closest the
Illini would get - Thompson
and sophomore forward Rachel
Sheffer combined for Michi-
gan's next 13 points to increase
the lead back to double digits.
The Wolverines were nearly
flawless from the charity stripe
down the stretch, and they fin-
ished the game 18-for-22 from
the line.

Sophomore forward Kate Thompson scored 13 points in the Michigan win.

"Before the game, Coach was
saying that we'll be successful if
we get to the line," Thompson
said.
"(We knew) it would put them
in trouble."
Sheffer, who was 6-for-6 from
the charity stripe, reached dou-
ble digits in points for the sixth-
straight game and has been
pivotal to the success of this
young Wolverine squad.
"I don't know if (today) was
one of her better games, but
she's developing into a postplay-
er down there," Borseth said.
"She's scoring against kids that
are bigger than her, and she's

learning in the process."
With a rematch against Big
Ten-leading Michigan State
looming next Sunday, the Wol-
verines will have a week to
digest this one and prepare for
what will arguably be their most
important game so far this sea-
son.
But first, there was a football
game to watch - at least for
coach Borseth.
"Right now, we're gonna go
watch the Super Bowl," he said.
"That's what I'm gonna do.
Then we've got to get ourselves
energy, because Michigan State
is a big game that we want to be

the Wolverines' last possession
that didn't count due to a shot
clock violation.
But fortunately for the Michi-
gan women's basketball team,
that was about the only thing that
went wrong for Hicks all game.
Hicks scored the Wolverines'
first eight points to bring them
out of an early chasm and led
them to a 69-59 victory over the
Fighting Illini:Coming off a slug-
gish loss to Penn State, Hicks
made sure Michigan didn't lose
its' third straight game.
She tied a career high with
24 points, including nine from
beyond the 3-point arc, while
shooting 64 percent from the
floor. Hicks also grabbed eight
rebounds and four assists and
played some of her best defense
of the season, nabbing four
steals andsforcing countless
poor Illini shots.
"She played within herself,
which was really good," Michi-
gan coach Kevin Borseth said
after the game. "Obviously, she
got things done when she had to."
It's an understatement to say
Hicks has been vital to Michi-
gan's success this season. She
leads the team in points, with
close to 12 per game, as well as
rebounds, with just over five per

game.

Michigan disappoints against Nittany Lions

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan wrestling team showed
this weekend that it belongs among the
nation's best.
But Sunday's meet against No. 3 Penn
State also showed the 13th-ranked Wol-
verines (5-1 Big Ten, 10-3 overall) that
they aren't quite in the Nittany Lions'
league.
After a commanding 26-9 victory over
No. 6 Wisconsin in Madison on Friday,
Michigan was outclassed by Penn State
on Sunday, losing28-13.
"I felt we wrestled really well Friday
night," Michigan coach Joe McFarland
said Sunday. "To be honest, I think we
needed to wrestle tougher in situa-
tions against Penn State. You can't give
up three pins and a major decision and
expect to beat a good team. It's unfor-
tunate and a little disappointing, but we
need to rebound and take something
from this."
SPECIAL TEAMS
From Page lB
"I can't figure it out," Michigan coach
Red Berenson said after Saturday's game.
"We're one of the least penalized teams
in the league andthey mightbe one of the
more penalized, and who gets all of the
penalties (in) the first half of the game
when the game's on the line? That's the
story of the game."
The Wolverines went 0-for-10 on the
power play in the series, getting just nine
shots combined onthose man-advantages.
Even when Michigan pulled its goalie

For every sour feeling the Wolverines
were left with on Sunday, they had an
equally positive Fridaynight.
In a night of upsets, redshirt junior
Justin Zeerip got Michigan started by
squeaking past the Badgers' No. 12 Ben
Jordan.
Wisconsin (0-3-1, 9-3-1) and Michigan
would split the next four matches. Red-
shirt sophomore Ben Apland defeated
the Badgers' No.11 Eric Bugenhagen, and
sophomore Sean Boyle followed suit with
awin of his own.
Wisconsin pulled even at 9-9, but that
was as close as it would get.
Redshirt junior Kellen Russell and
redshirt freshman Eric Grajales each
won in major decisions, 10-2 and 11-3,
respectively. Russell - ranked No.l in the
141-pound class - started a four-match
win streak for the Wolverines to close the
meet.
Redshirt freshmen Brandon Zeerip
and Dan Yates picked up the final two
wins.
in the closing minutes on Friday, it had
trouble. With the six-on-five advantage,
the Wolverines had four shots blocked
before Cannone took one of those blocks
the other way and tapped in the goal on
the empty-net breakaway.
Miami's game-tying and game-win-
ning goals Friday - in addition to Can-
none's goal on Saturday - were with the
extra man.
"Their power play is better than ours,"
Berenson said. "It's as simple as that."
Looking at the players involved, that
little pass by Miele was an even more
accurate representation of the weekend
than it appears. Miele and Cannone com-

Despite riding the momentum that
comes with a six-game win streak - four
of which came over ranked teams - the
Wolverines were unable to withstand
the pressure of facing powerhouse Penn
State. The Nittany Lions (3-2, 13-2) were
No. 1 until falling to No. 3 this week after
back-to-back losses.
From the get-go,it was Penn State who
seemed to want it more.
"I think we got a little out-wrestled,"
Russell said Sunday. "People weren't
wrestling as hard as they could in this
match. I'd rather have it right now than
next weekend. Hopefully we'll take this
in, we'll digestit and work hard all week."
Despite scoring on a takedown in the
meet's opening seconds, junior Zac Ste-
vens was thoroughly dominated,losing in
a major decision.
Russell won in dramatic fashion to
extend his win streak to 28 and improve
to 27-0 on the season.
Matched up against Penn State's No. 7
Andrew Alton, who Russell has narrowly
bined for nine points on the series and
were involved in all seven goals Miami
scored this weekend.
Miele scored the game-tying goal on
Friday. Cannone set up the game winner
by making a deke on junior defenseman
Greg Pateryn that will go on the Red-
Hawk's season-ending highlight reel.
Berenson summed up Miami's seven
goals in two offensive outbursts as con-
cise as possible: "Their best players were
their best players."
The sweep vaulted the RedHawks (13-
7-4-2 CCHA, 16-9-5 overall) into first
place and dropped Michigan into third
behind idle Notre Dame. The Wolverines
DEFENSE
From Page 1B
Friday's loss was due to a three-goal
third period comeback by the RedHawks
- Michigan had previously been unde-
feated, 15-0-3, when carrying a lead into
the final frame.
"We just have to play a full 60 minutes
and we can't give their players time,"
sophomore forward A.J. Treais said after
Friday's game. "They have two or three
of the best players in the country and
you can't give that guy time and space
or they're goingto make plays, and that's
what they did."
The late-game defensive mishapswere
captured perfectly in the RedHawks'
game-winning goal on Friday.
With just over four minutes left in
regulation, Miami's Pat Connone entered
the Michigan zone, and right when junior
defenseman Greg Pateryn approached
him with a challenge, Cononne pulled
the puck back and darted around him
with a flourish. With Pateryn beat, Can-

defeated in two previous matches this
year, Russell needed overtime to win, 3-1.
With the score just 1-1 heading into
overtime, Russell wasn't thinking about
losingeither the match or the streak.
"If you think like that then you're
going to lose, bottom line," Russell said.
"The whole time, I knew I was going
to win. I was just trying to look for that
opportunity to win.You're always glad to
get out of that one (with a win), but there's
always stuff you can improve on."
But after Russell, the Nittany Lions
controlled the rest of the bout.
Penn State would take four of the next
five matches - two of which were pins
- to build an insurmountable 22-6 lead.
Yates pulled off Michigan's lone win in
that span.
The Wolverines were able to finish
the meet on a bit of a bright spot, as fifth-
year senior Anthony Biondo and Boyle
recorded victories. Boyle, who's won his
last four matches, wasone of Michigan's
lone wbright spots on the weekend.
(14-7-1-0,17-9-4) have now lost three in a
row after their loss to Michigan State last
Saturday.
Though the Wolverines do have two
games in hand on Miami, they lost their
games in hand with second-place Notre
Dame by getting swept this weekend.
"I think everyone's, somehow, looking
at (the standings)," Hagelin said. "From
now on, we're going to do everything we
can to beat those guys, but at the same
time they have to lose some games ... We

"If you're a forward, you say that's a
good move - if you're a defenseman, you
say that's a terrible move," Berenson said
of Cononne's deke.
"(Pateryn) missed him completely, you
can't do that. You can't do that. You can't

Hunwick, who kept the Wolverines with-

described as a "shooting gallery" late in
his 28-save performance on Friday.
With the CCHA lead hanging in the
balance, Michigan will not only need
good goaltending, but it will also need to
cut down on the number ofshooting gal-

"Defense first ... just make sure that all

ther, I'll ask another question. When's
the last time, somebody, literally any-
body, on the Michigan team scored on
a breakaway?
It has been a problem all season.
Michigan has no one who can create
instant offense. Fortunately for the
Wolverines, they have covered it up
with their depth and timely scoring to
remain near the top of the conference
standings.
Maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe the
Wolverines can ride their depth and
timely scoring from the blue line to
the Frozen Four.
They were one whistled-off goal
away from getting there a year ago
with a similar situation.
But at the risk of turningthis col-
umn into a game of 20 Questions, do
three minutes in the first frame due to
foul trouble.
"Motivation was key in that (half),"
Hardaway Jr. said. "I just saw how my
teammates were playing and just said,
'Darius (Morris) can't be the only one
going to the lane and Matt Vogrich com-
ing off the bench for me can't be the only
one hitting open shots."'
Hardaway Jr.'s scoring spurt trig-
gered the comeback and Michigan
knotted the game at 53 points with
4:40 left. Morris then hit a jumper and
a layup to put his team ahead by two
points. His roommate Jordan Morgan
- who tallied a career-high 11 rebounds
- practically sealed the contest with a
monster dunk seconds later, giving the
Wolverines all the momentum and a
three-point lead.
Keeping it within two possessions
for the last two minutes, Penn State
made it a game. The Wolverine bench
players started biting their finger-
nails when Morris got the ball on a fast
break. But with the team only up by

you think Michigan can make a second
consecutive run through the postsea-
son, without being down late in the
game and needing a player to step up
and score?
The Miami series exposed Michigan's
lack of a top-tier play maker. Michigan
State coach Rick Comley called Michi-
gan "the best team in the country top to
bottom," after its game last week.
But it didn't take much more than
one guy to beat the top-to-bottom
Wolverines.
"I think that Miele guy, he's the
only one who can really do things
himself," Hagelin said. "Other than
that, they're not a great offensive
team."
In this case, one isa lot more than
none.

five points, he decided not to shoot it
and instead held onto the ball to con-
trol the tempo.
After being fouled, Morris missed his
ensuing free throw, and Penn State had
eight seconds to get back on offense and
knot the game up with a 3-pointer. But
Nittany Lion guard Tim Frazier was
injured in transition, and with just four
players on the offensive end, Penn State
blew its opportunity. Michigan was able
to pull out the win despite Morris's lapse
of judgment.
"How about that?" Beilein said. "You
know what (Morris) said to me? He was
trying to be classy, like (how) you don't
run up the score when you're up ten. He
was trying to just dribble it out and not
show them up. (You don't do that) when
you're up five."
Beilein said that stunt will serve as
something this youthful Wolverine team
learns from. Michigan will return home
to Crisler Arena to take on Northwest-
ern this Wednesday in hopes of garner-
ing its fifth conference win.

MEN'S TRACK AND FIELD
Michigan holds own

JAKE FROMM/Daily
Junior guard Stu Douglass scored 14 points off the bench for the Wolverines, including 4-5 from beyond the 3-point arc against Penn State.

STATE COLLEGE - Junior
guard Zack Novak stood in the
locker room following the Michi-
gan men's basketball team's 65-62
win over Penn State on Sunday
and said the team's 3-point shoot-
ing was pretty good.
He paused and thought over
the numbers - 48 percent for the
game, 56 percent in the second
half.
"I guess that's probably really
good," he said with a laugh.
The Wolverines (4-7 Big Ten,
14-10 overall) bested the Nittany
Lions from long range by 11 per-
cent, which, for this team, almost
always guarantees a win. On the
season, Michigan is 12-0 when
leading in 3-point shooting per-
centage.
Through the first tep minutes
of the game, the Wolverines only
attempted two long-range shots
- uncharacteristic forateam that
averages 24 shots per game from
beyond the arc. At that rate, the
Wolverines would have taken just
eight 3-pointers the whole game.
The Nittany Lions (5-6, 12-10)

had prepared all week for a John
Beilein-coached team - a squad
trigger-happy from deep - by
focusing on getting hands in the
faces of shooters..
Penn State did a good job of
weathering the Wolverines'
offensive pressure for most of the
first half, establishing an 11-point
lead after senior David Jackson
nailed a 3-pointer.
But the Michigan attack,
fueled by junior Stu Douglass
and sophomore Matt Vogrich, hit
three-consecutive 3-pointers to
pull within two points of the Nit-
tany Lions. It was the spark that
allowed the Wolverines to go into
halftime with a 27-24 lead.
According to senior guard
Talor Battle, Penn State shot
itself in the leg when its defense
allowed the Wolverines' perim-
eter players to catch fire at that
point in the game.
"With a team like Michi-
gan, they're never out of a game
because they shoot the ball so
well from (long range)," Battle
said after the game. "We just
stand there with our hands down
and they knock it in our faces. It's
just so disappointing. Every time

it goes up, we just see the ball
going through the hoop."
While Penn State did a good
job of guarding the shooters in set
plays during the first half, Michi-
gan displayed its ability to score
in transition - Douglass and
Vogrich's 3-pointers came off the
fast break.
"(Michigan) coach (John
Beilein) always says, 'If you're
coming in transition and you've
got a wide-open shot on the wing
- and it's a shooter and you're,
feeling good - shoot,' " Douglass
said on Sunday. "You might not
get a better shot the next thirty
seconds if you run (the) offense.
No matter how well you run it,
you might not find a better shot
than that."
In the second half, the Wolver-
ines settled into their offense and
scored off set plays. And when
Penn State moved into a 1-3-1
zone to switch things up defen-
sively, Michigan was able to take
advantage of the holes on the
wings.
With sophomore point guard
Darius Morris penetrating the
zone and kicking out to open
shooters, the Wolverines were

able to put up 19 3-point shots.
Throughout the season, the
young team has been learning
the difference between a good
shot and a better shot. On a few
occasions, Douglass passed up
what looked like open shots,
only to find someone who was
more open. It's something Dou-
glass believes the team has been
getting better at during the last
three to five games.
Four different players con-
tributed from deep for the Wol-
verines. That's vital - other
teams can't key in on just one
deep-shooting threat.
"Coaches are nervous when
they're up 15, because you hit
three (3-pointers) and it's a six-
point game - you can get back
in a game very quickly," Beilein
said. "So (the 3-point shot) is
very good offensively, (but also)
very bad defensively for teams
when they're leading."
Penn State is the newest team
to learn that lesson from the
Wolverines. But if Vogrich is
right in describing the Wolver-
ines' hot hands as "contagious,"
there's a good chance the Nit-
tany Lions won't be the last.

Competing in a meet that
included SEC powers like Ala-
bama and Mississippi, the
Michigan men's track and field
team knew it was going to be
hard to win events.
But even with the inflated
competition, the Wolverines
put themselves toward the top
of the scoreboards at the Meyo
Invitational in South Bend
this weekend. The two-day,
unscored meet included schools
ranging from North Dakota, to
Illinois and into the southeast.
"It was the biggest quantity
of quality competition we've
had this year," Michigan coach
Fred LaPlante said on Saturday.
"In track, you're going to have
pockets where some teams are
stronger in some events than
others. When you have a lot of
teams that compete, then every
event is strong.
"One school might have a
good jumper, but not a good
sprinter, and vice versa."
The Wolverines held their
own, taking home six third- .
place finishes and two runners-
up.
Perhaps the most impres-
sive performance of the week-
end came from junior Robert
Peddlar in the long jump. The
Jamaica native finished second,
jumping 24 feet and 10.5 inches
- a personal record.
"This past week, we've real-
ly been working on our tech-
niques, and I just came into
the meet focused on that, and I
believe that's what allowed me
to jump as well as I did," Ped-
dlar said.
The former indoor Big Ten
champion believes his marks
are still improving, and that he
will be able to record his best
jumps in the Big Ten Champion-
ships on Feb. 26.
Freshman Ali Arastu also put
together his best performance
of the year, placing second in
the 500 meters with a time of
1:03.81. Though the 500 meters
isn't an official indoor event,
LaPlante believes that Arastu's
performance will translate well
to the outdoor season, when he
will run the 400-meter hurdles.

While most indoor tracks are
a 200-meter oval, Notre Dame's
facilities include a 300-meter
track, which allowed for faster
times in all races longer than
60 meters. A 300-meter track
has longer straightaways where
runners can hit top speed for
longer periods of time.
"I didn't worry about the
competition," redshirt sopho-
more Matt Campbell said after
winning the unseeded section
of the 400 meters. "I just took
the opportunity to get a better
time and run on a better track.
I looked at it as a new opportu-
nity rather than an obstacle."
Among other top performers
was redshirt freshman Bradley
James, who cleared seven feet
in the high jump for the fourth
straight meet (jumping off of
four different surfaces). James,
along with freshman shot put-
ter Cody Riffle, redshirt fresh-
man 35-pound weight thrower
Ethan Dennis, sophomore 200-
meter runner Aaron Taylor,
freshman 60-meter hurdler
Erick Gavin and the 4x400
meter relay team all took third
place in their events.
Michigan will have an eye on
the Big Ten Championships as it
competes in the next two meets
leading up to Feb. 26.
The Wolverines will rest ath-
letes when they feel necessary,
as they did with the distance
runners in this weekend's com-
petition.
"When you get to a certain
point in the year, it takes a toll
on your body," LaPlante said.
"Mentally it's good, but physi-
cally, you need to get recovered
for the next competition."
This weekend's meet also
gave Michigan a sneak peak at
what it will be going up against
in the Big Ten Championships
- Purdue, Indiana and Illinois
were part of the Meyo Invita-
tional field.
Michigan knows what it has
to do to top these teams ina few
weeks.
"We need to improve on
being more consistent," Camp-
bell said. "We can't let little
things get us down. We need to
learn from our mistakes and get
better. That's the only way we'll
do well at the Big Ten meet."


MEN'S TENNIS
Blue sweeps singles matches,

Wolverines blank Kentucky

Michigan coach
Berque one win
away from No. 100
for career
By MATT RUDNITSKY
Daily Sports Writer
Trailing No. 21 Wake Forest
1-0 on Saturday night at the Var-
sity Tennis Center, the No. 23
Michigan men's tennis team had
reason to worry.
The Wolverines had lost the
doubles point in three straight
matches, which eventually cost
them the dual match twice. Last
year, Michigan was 12-4 when
it won the point and 2-7 when it
didn't.
But the Wolverines (3-2) dug
themselves out of the early hole,
taking all six singles matches to
recorda lopsided 6-1 victory.
"You always want to win
the doubles point," Michigan
coach Bruce Berque said. "But
we know it's just one point out
of seven. So, yeah, I was con-
cerned, but I was comfortable,
looking at the matchups, that
we could win four out of six sin-
gles (matches). Against a top-25
team, to be down 1-0, that's a lot
of pressure, but our guys han-
dled it well."
In doubles play, Wake For-
est (1-2) won two of the three
matches to take the point. The
lone Wolverine win went to
the top tandem of senior cap-
tain Jason Jung and sophomore
Evan King - the No. 28 pair in
the nation.

The last time the Michigan
women's tennis team met Ken-
tucky, it was 2008 - the first year
of Michigan coach Ronni Bern-
stein's career inAnn Arbor.
Kentucky easily won, blanking
Michigan, 7-0.
This time around, the seventh-
ranked Wolverines came back
swinging and won all nine match-
es to keep their four-game home
series a perfect one.
Michigan (4-0 overall) took its
match on Saturday against the
Wildcats, 7-0, making Kentucky
the second visitor in four matches
at the Varsity Tennis Center to
leave with a 7-0 loss.
"Our seniors were freshmen the
last time we faced Kentucky, and
it was only their second match at
Michigan," Bernstein said. "Obvi-
ously, a lot has changed. We have
great seniors and obviously our
freshmen are stepping up. Every-
one is steppingup."
Michigan kicked off the com-
petition in doubles, sweeping all
three matches to take the point
and the early lead. At one time,
all three Wolverine pairs led 4-2,
before clinching their matches in
various fashions.
Senior Rika Tatsuno and junior
Michelle Sulahian were the first
pair off the court, beating Ken-
tucky's Khristina Blajkevitch and
CeCe Witten at No. 3,8-2.
The tandem at No. 2 doubles
- sophomore Mimi Nguyen and
freshman Sam Critser - clinched
the point for Michigan, taking its
match shortly after, 8-3.
The Wolverines entered sin-
gles play and took a strong stance
from the first volley. Four of the
six Michigan singles players took
their first set by at least three
games.
Eleventh-ranked senior Denise
Muresan led off, taking the match

at No. 1 singles 6-1, 6-1. This was
Muresan's 93rd victory, moving
her up to fifth for all-time wins in
the Michigan women's tennis pro-
gram.
"I just had a good week of prac-
tice and learned from the loss
that I had last week against USC,"
Muresan said. "I'm so proud of the
team. They had a really great win."
Nguyen continued the Wolver-
ines' point streak, taking charge at
the No. 4 slot and winning6-2, 6-3,
while Sulahian sealed the match
for Michigan at the sixth singles
court with a straight-set victory.
The next three points all went
the Wolverines' way - but not
without a fight.
Freshman Brooke Bolender,
after winning her first set, fought
back after a 3-2 deficit in the sec-
ond. After Kentucky's Jessica
Stiles tied the set at 6-6, sending
it to a tiebreaker, Bolender fell
behind 5-2. A few solid rallies and
help from a third party - the net

- allowed her to come back in the
tiebreaker set and win the match;
6-4,7-6(6).
"She just stepped back a little bit
and was waiting for her opponent
to maybe make mistakes instead
of sticking with her game," Bern-
stein said of Bolender's second set.
"When we get in those positions, I
want them to step up and go for it,
instead of letting their opponents
to come at them. Brooke did that
in the end."
Michigan stays perfect on the
year as it prepares for its first road
match of the season. The Wol-
verines will travel to South Bend
on Thursday to play the Fighting
Irish.
"It's nice to get Kentucky back
for sure, " Bernstein said. "But it's
just one win. It gets tougher next
