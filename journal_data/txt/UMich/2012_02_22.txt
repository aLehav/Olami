LEGAL DISPUTE
Board passes
resolution

In emergency
meeting, regents
oppose bill barring
GSRA unionization
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily Staff Reporter
Even though none of the Uni-
versity's regents were in the
room, the tension was palpable.
At a contentious 8 a.m. tele-
conference meeting yesterday,,
the University's Board of Regents
met to consider a motion to state
the body's opposition to pending
legislation in the Michigan Sen-
ate that would formally disqual-

ify graduate student research
assistants from classificajtion
as public employees - render-
ing them ineligible for unioniza-
tion. The regents voted 6-2, in a
party-line vote, in support of the
motion. The Graduate Employ-
ees' Organization is currently
working within the Michigan
Employment Relations Commis-
sion's system to achieve a vote for
GSRAs on unionization.
Before the debate on wheth-
er or not the motion would be
approved by the board, Regents
Andrea Fischer Newman (R-
Ann Arbor) and Andrew Rich-
ner (R-Grosse Pointe Park), the
sole Republicans on the board,
expressed their belief that the

a highly individualized, holis-
tic view of each applicant's file,
giving serious consideration to
all the ways an applicant might
contribute to a diverse educa-
tional environment," Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in
the majority opinion.
Charles Shipan, political
science professor and depart-
ment chair, said it is likely the
Supreme Court will agree with
Fisher's claim because of the
conservative voting history of
the majority of the court's cur-
rent judges.
"Several of the judges in the
Court right now, including (Jus-
tice Clarence) Thomas and (Jus-
tice Antonin) Scalia don't feel
bound by precedent very much
at all," Shipan said.
According to Shipan, a ruling
in favor of Fisher would affect
public institutions that consid-
er race in their evaluations of
applicants.

"If a school is currently say-
ing that we take a holistic look
... they can no longer use race as
one of the factors," Shipan said.
Shipan added the ruling is
not based solely on which side
the court takes, but on how the
decision is defined and justified.
"(The Supreme Court) law-
fully (has) a lot of leeway to
make other sorts of decisions...
whether they'll cast it very
broadly and completely elimi-
nate race from consideration,
or whether they'll cast it more
narrowly, and find some things
about how Texas does it and
strike that down," Shipan said.
University spokeswoman
Kelly Cunningham said the Uni-
versity will closely follow the
case and its potential impact on
public education, but the deci-
sion may not change University
admission policies.

From East Coast Swing to the
Lindy Hop, at Swing Ann Arbor
students and- community mem-
bers can learn the steps necessary
to masterboth.
SAA is a University campus
organization that teaches stu-
dents and Ann Arbor residents
how to swing dance - whether
they have prior experience or
not - at weekly meetings in the
Michigan Union.
Rackham student Sara Lapan,
the SAA curriculum director,
said there is a fun and welcom-
ing environment at the meetings,
adding that there are free begin-
ner lessons offered to teach the
different dances.
The organization also runs two

month-long series for different
dances, including Lindy Hop for
beginners, according to Lapan.
Lapan likened Lindy Hop to "a
fancy new car," adding that East
Coast Swing is the "generic rental
that gets you around until your
Lindy Hop is ready."
The two signature dances
taught at SAA meetings are Lindy
Hop and Charleston, while begin-
ners start off with the easier and
more famous East Coast Swing.
SAA also hosts special workshops
with choreographed dances that
integrate jazz steps less common
in swing dances.
Rackham student Nathan Rix,
a SAA member, wrote in an email

it easy to feel comfortable and
participate.
"The only requirement is that
you be yourself," Rix wrote. "The
point is simply to have fun, listen,
and play. And anyone can join."

members, as the club is open to
anyone interested in the art of
swing dancing.
SAA holds weekly dance
meetings every. Wednesday.

Regulators allow imports of
cancer drugs in dire shortage V

Quality concerns over
domestic production
led to shuttering of
labs and facilities
TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Feder-
al regulators have approved new
suppliers for two crucial cancer
drugs, easing critical shortages
that had been ratcheting up fears
that patients, particularly chil-
dren with leukemia, would miss
lifesaving treatments.
Butthere are currently283sep-
arate prescription drugs in short
supply or unavailable nationwide,
and regulators and manufactur-
ers say shortages are a long-term
problem that will continue to give
patients and doctors nightmares.
Yesterday, the Food and Drug
Administration said it will tem-

porarily allow importation of
a replacement drug for Doxil,
a drug for recurrent ovarian or
bone marrow cancer. The John-
son & Johnson drug hasn't been
available for new patients for
months because J&J's contract
manufacturer had to shut down
production over serious quality
lapses.
The FDA also has approved a
new supplier for a preservative-
free version of methotrexate, a
crucial drug for children with a
type of leukemia called ALL, for
lymphomas and for the bone can-
cer osteosarcoma. The version
with preservatives, the one that's
been scarce, can be toxic or cause
paralysis in children and other
patientsgettingthe drugeitherby
injections into spinal cord fluid or
at very high doses.
The FDA also has approved the
release of a batch manufactured

by Ben Venue Laboratories Inc.,
shortly before it closed several
factories at its complex in Bed-
ford, Ohio, due to serious quality
problems. That closing was what
turned the periodic methotrexate
shortage that began in late 2008
into a crisis almost overnight,
with fears that kids would begin
missing treatments within weeks.
"We have made real progress
... We believe that (suppliers) will
be able to meet the demands of
patients in the U.S. market" for
the two drugs indefinitely, FDA
Dr. Commissioner Margaret A.
Hamburg told The Associated
Press in an exclusive interview.
"It's a huge relief for us."
Numerous medical and drug-
maker groups, along with the
White House, applauded the news
but cautioned that much still must
be done to resolve all the prob-
lems causing shortages.

After bin Laden raid, popularity of
Navy SEAL film explodes nationally

Independent movie
about SEAL life
shown in 2,500
theaters
Washington (AP) - Navy
SEALs never expected the film
"Act of Valor," starring real,
active-duty Navy SEALs, to be
this big.
Five years ago, commanders
allowed a small, independent film
company into their elite ranks to
turn real-life training exercises
into a feature-length movie in
hopes of drumming up recruits
fast
SEAL officers thought the film
would open in a couple of theaters
in military towns, then quietly
move to cable television, where
re-runs would draw likeminded
youths to join the special opera-
tions world.
Then came the Navy SEALs

raid that killed Osama bin Laden in
Pakistan last year, and a high-pro-
file hostage rescue in Somalia last
month. President Barack Obama
delivered his State of the Union
address and gave a shout-out to
SEALS, with Adm. Bill McRaven,
the SEAL and bin Laden raid com-
mander, sitting quietly in Obama's
box.
Now, the once modest recruit-
ing project is set to open Feb. 24 in
roughly2,500theatersnationwide,
putting an uncomfortable spot-
light on a group that prides itself
on keeping its collective mouth
shut about clandestine operations.
The officers and staff who
helped bring the film about
spoke on condition of anonymity
because they are embarrassed by
the massive media blitz and public
interest, and - most of all - they
are tired ofgettinggrieffromtheir
special operations colleagues,
whose daring exploits haven't
made it into the headlines.
One of the few that's gone on

record is overall special opera-
tions commander McRaven.
"It was initially started as a
recruiting film so we could help
recruit minorities into the teams,"
McRaven explained. He said he
didn't think the film gave any-
thing away to the enemy, nor
would it put in danger the SEALs
who starred in it.
McRaven told a Washington
audience recently that he'd signed
up for special operations forces
after seeing the 1968 John Wayne
film, "The Green Berets," and
that he had worked on the movie
"Raise the Titanic" as a young
ensign, also to drive recruitment.
Toward that end, the script was
designed to showcase two things,
according to producer-directors
Mike "Mouse" McCoy and Scott
Waugh: real acts of valor by
SEALs on the battlefield since
Sept. 11, and the SEALs' unique
technical abilities to reach a tar-
get by sea, air or land as the acro-
nym suggests.

Environmental groups yester-

Representatives of five orga-

the final day of a public comment
period on a regulation the Envi-

posed last fall. It would require
oceangoing commercial vessels to
install technology strong enough

mussels and even microorganisms
such as viruses that lurk in bal-

harbors after ships arrive in port.
Environmentalists want tougher

tors in Cuba found a new lesion in
the same place where a cancerous
tumor was removed last year and
said that he is not deathly ill but
will require surgery.
"It is a small lesion of about two
centimeters (less than one inch)
in diameter, very clearly visible,"
Chavez told state television from
Barinas, his home state.
The announcement thrust Ven-
ezuelan politics into new uncer-
tainty because the socialist leader
is seeking re-election this year,
hoping to extend his more than 13
years in power with a new six-year
term.

BOARD
From Page 1A
meeting was not called properly
according to Regents' Bylaws
and the Michigan Open Meet-
ings Act. Newman and Richner
voted against the resolution.
According to the bylaws,
three regents or the University
president can request an emer-
gency meeting to take action
on a particular issue, but it was
unclear whether or not Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Coleman
had declared this an emergency
meeting. In the meeting, Cole-
man said she had not formally
declared this an emergency, but
a previous e-mail sent to the
regents implied that the meeting
should be considered an emer-
gency, Regent' Laurence Deitch
(D-Bingham Farms) said.
It was unclear which three
regents had also declared the
meetingto be an emergency.
"If we're going to take a posi-
tion, we should have a public
meeting under the auspices of
the Open Meetings Act," New-
man said. "This is not that meet-
ing."
The only notification for the
meeting was an e-mail sent to
the media at 10:50 p.m. Monday,
University spokeswoman Kelly
Cunningham said. There was no

apparent postirfg of the meeting
on the regents' website or in the
Fleming Administration Build-
ing.
Suellyn Scarnecchia, the
University's vice president and
general counsel, said she thinks
the meeting is considered legal
based on the bylaws, but was
pressed on the issue by several
regents.
"The definition (of emergency)
is not provided in the bylaws, and
it is based on any opinion of the
president or three members of
the board," Scarnecchia said.
Though the issue of the
legality of the meeting was left
unresolved, Regent Laurence
Deitch (D-Bingham Farms)
proposed a resolution stating
the regents' formal opposition
to Senate Bill 971, which would
bar GSRAs from obtaining
union representation or col-
lective bargaining rights since
they would not be considered
public employees.
"Adoption of this law would
be tantamount to changing the
rules of the game in the middle of
thatgame," Deitchsaid. "To do so
would be a violation of due pro-
cess which is inconsistent with
the core values of the University."
Deitch was careful to stress
that his resolution neither
favored nor opposed the forma-
tion of the union, but instead

focused on allowing the current
process within MERC to contin-
ue without interference from the
legislature.
"The regents have not, and
I emphasize, have not, taken a
position on whether the union
should win an election or not,
and we do not do so today."
Deitch said. "The regents' deci-
sion is predicated on our support
for freedom of choice for valuable
members of the university com-
munity."
Deitch's motion also instruct-
ed Cynthia Wilbanks, the Uni-
versity's vice president for
government relations, to use the
University's resources to lobby
against the bill in Lansing.
At the . meeting, Newman
expressed her opposition to the
motion and found it inappropri-
ate for the University to take a
position toward legislation in
this case.
"The idea that due process
precludes legislative action
implies a basic misunderstand-
ing of control over government,"
Newman said. "Without the
legislative policies and goals as
a framework, the MERC has no
framework at all."
Richner also opposed the
motion, stating his belief that
the University should sup-
port the legislation rather than
oppose it.

SENATE
From Page 1A
The action also occurred
amid proceedings before an
administrative law judge who
is currently, hearing testimo-
ny from witnesses called by
Michigan Attorney General Bill
Schuette and Students Against
GSRA Unionization, both of
whom believe that GSRAs
should be classified as public
employees. The administrative
judge will submit a recommen-
dation on the employment sta-
tus of GSRAs to the Michigan
Employment Relations Com-
mission next month.
Rackham student Liz
Rodrigues, communications
chair for the Graduate Employ-
ees' Organization, said she
believes Senate Bill 971 is dis-
rupting the ongoing MERC pro-
ceedings and said she objects to
the subject matter of the legisla-
tion.
Rackham student Stephen
Raiman, founder of SAGU, dis-
agreed with the Rodriques' state-
ment that the bill is interfering in
the democratic process.
"It's the legislature's job to
set policy, and it's MERC's job to
interpret that policybased on law,
so it's absolutely not interfering
with MERC's decision because
MERC should be carrying out the
law that the legislature writes,"
Raiman said.
Among those who testified
against the bill were Wilbanks
and Rackham student Jeremy
Moore, a member of GEO. Engi-
neering Prof. Fawwaz Ulaby and
Rackham student Melinda Day
testified in support of the bill.
Ulaby, who was invited to
testify by Richardville's staff,
said in an interview that GSRAs
should not be allowed to unionize
given that they are students, not
employees.

"The idea of unionizing one
segment of this larger class of
graduate students is ludicrous,"
Ulaby said. "If it applies to
GSRAs, it applies to all of them,
and by extension, it applies to
all students. So the logic there
should suggest ... that we should
unionize all 40,000 students at
the University of Michigan."
Ulaby garnered some atten-
tion last month when he started
a petition directed at the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents express-
ing opposition to the GSRA
unionization. Regents Andrea
Fischer Newman (R-Ann Arbor)
and Andrew Richner (R- Grosse
Pointe Park) also signed the peti-
tion. Newman and Richner, the
only Republicans on the board,
also voted against the regents'
resolution at yesterday's emer-
gency meeting.
In an interview, Day said
she was pleased by the result of
today's hearing.
"I think it's the right thing,"
Day said. "I think obviously the,
situation has indicated a need to
clarify the original intent of the
Public Employment Relations
Act."
Rodrigues, on the other hand,
said she was disappointed that
the bill passed through commit-
tee, but said it was predictable
given its Republican majority.
"Clearly this is a concerning bill,
and we are disappointed that it
passed and consider it to be an
attack on GSRAs' right to have an
election," she said.
Minority Floor Leader Tupac
Hunter (D-Detroit) was one of
the two committee members
who voted against the bill. He
also proposed that the panel
wait to vote on the bill until the
MERC proceedings have con-
cluded. Hunger's resolution was
voted down by the committee.

VARGAS
From Page 1A
His grandfather then
informed him of his undocu-
mented status, embroiling Var-
gas in a series of elaborate lies
that allowed him to obtain a
driver's license and social secu-
rity card.
"It's a dangerous thing to be
sixteen in America and realize
that the flag you've been pledg-
ing allegiance to didn't belong to
you," he said.
He added that his high school
English teacher led him to jour-
nalism, where he found security
in working and "contributing to
society."
In 2008, Vargas was a part
of a Pulitzer Prize winning
team of journalists, which won
the award for Breaking News
Reporting for its coverage of
the 2007 Virginia Tech shoot-
ings. He also wrote an in-depth
profile of Facebook creator
Mark Zuckerberg in September
2010. Vargas, who was initially
hired by The Washington Post

in 2004, quickly rose to the
highest echelons of the journal-
ism world.
Last summer,'Vargas finally
told his story in a highly-publi-
cized article in The New York
Times Magazine to demonstrate
undocumented immigrants'
diverse backgrounds and profes-
sions.
Vargas said undocumented
immigrants paid $11.2 billion
in local and state taxes in 2010,
and 63 percent have resided in
the United States for 10 years or
longer.
Vargas added that the nature
of immigration in the United
States changed significantly over
the last 50 years.
"The interesting thing, of
course, is that most of the immi-
grants coming in the late 19th
century were white," he said.
"Most of tkie people coming to
this country since the Immigra-
tion Act of 1965 - legal and ille-
gal - have been mostly Asian
and Latino; that's the only differ-
ence."
He provided evidence that the
American population is shifting,

citing that slightly over a third
of Americans belong to minority
groups.
"It's not going to get any less
gay, any less Asian, any less
Latino or Black," he said. "The
question of how we define Amer-
ican is coming face-to-face with
a demographically changing
America."
At the event, University of
Detroit Mercy senior Maria
Ibarra also recounted her expe-
riences as an undocumented
immigrant.
Ibarra moved to the United
States from Mexico when she
was 9, and she said she no longer
identifies asa Mexican citizen.
Ibarra said she had hoped to.
gain admission to the University,
but was unable to apply because
of her status as an undocunented
immigrant.
"I had to pretend that I was
a normal student while inside
I just felt so alone," she said. "I
felt like I didn't have a right to an
education. I didn't deserve what
my classmates were getting, and
felt that this wasn't for me."


SUPREME COURT
From Page 1A
gan ballot proposal, amended
the Michigan Constitution, by
banning preferential treatment
based on race, ethnicity, sex or
national origin in gaining admis-
sion to public universities and
other public institutions.
"We will be watching what
happens at the Supreme Court,
but the University has legal obli-
gations under state law, and so
whatever happens at the central
level is unlikely to change what
we do here," Cunningham said.
Last July, the 6th Circuit
Court of Appeals ruled that the
amendment was unconstitu-
tional.
"This is a tremendous victory
for the University of Michigan,
for all of higher education, and
for the hundreds of groups and

individuals who supported us,"
University President Mary Sue
Coleman said in a press release
addressing the ruling.
Michigan Attorney Gen-
eral Bill Schuette appealed the
court's ruling, and the full 6th
Circuit will again consider the
constitutionality of the proposal
on March 7.
Former University President
Lee Bollinger, now the president
of Columbia University, was a
defendant in Grutter v. Bollinger.
He said in an interview with The
New York Times that he was
concerned about the Supreme
Court taking up the affirmative
action issue again.
"I think it's ominous," Bol-
linger told the Times. "It threat-
ens to undo several decades of
effort within higher education to
build a more integrated and just
and educationally enriched envi-
ronment."

Vote in November
GOP candidates good for laughs, not much else
n 2008, a historic event occurred. Nearly 23 million 18 to 29-year-
olds voted in the presidential election - an uptick of more than
three million from the 2004 election. This number represented
the highest youth turnout since 1972. This turnout strongly favored
President Barack Obama, who received 66 percent of the youth vote.
In the 2010 midterm elections, only 21 percent of the same age group
cast ballots, contributing to sweeping Republican victories nation-
wide. With the 2012 presidential campaign in full swing and an under-
whelming cast of candidates competing in Michigan's Republican
primary next week, it's vital people of all ages vote. With that in mind,.
The Michigan Daily endorses voting in November.

Winter finally decides to come the week
before Spring Break. What's the deal,
@MotherNature? #globalwarming

Lin and political correctness

To better explain the endorsement, or lack
thereof, the editorial board will let the candi-
dates speak for themselves.
Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum
said in an interview with the Associated Press
on April 7, 2011 "In every society, the defini-
tion of marriage has not ever, to my knowledge,
included homosexuality. That's not to pick
on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on
child, man on dog, or whatever the case may
be." Last October, during an interview with
CaffienatedThoughts.com, he said, "One of the
things I will talk about, that no president has
talked about before, is I think the dangers of
contraception in this country, the whole sexual
libertine idea. Many of the Christian faith have
said, well, that's okay, contraception is okay. It's
not okay. It's a license to do things in a sexual
realm that is counter to how things are sup-
posed to be."
Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) discussed his views
on crime in a,1992 newsletter written under
his name. He wrote "Given the inefficiencies of
what D.C. laughingly calls the criminal justice
system, I think we can safely assume that 95
percent oftheblack males inthatcity are semi-
criminal or entirely criminal." When asked
about his views on homosexuality, Paul wrote
in the newsletter, "I miss the closet. Homo-
sexuals, not to speak of the rest of society, were
far better off when social pressure forced them
to hide their activities. They could also not be

as promiscuous. Is it any wonder the AIDS epi-
demic started after they 'came out of the clos-
et,' and started hyper-promiscuous sodomy?"
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney
often speaks about corporations, and said at
the Iowa State Fair last August that he thinks
"corporations are people, my friend." When
asked about the time he placed his dog in a
carrier and strapped the carrier to the roof
of his car, Romney said in a speech leading
up to the 2008 election "PETA is not happy
that my dog likes fresh air." Finally, Romney
relates to many Americans, stating, "I'm also
unemployed."
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in
a 1995 interview with The New Yorker said:
"I'm not a natural leader. I'm too intellectual;
I'm too abstract; I think too much." Gingrich
knows about the reality of politics: "Politics
and war are remarkably similar situations."
Finally, Gingrich said at a campaign stop in
Iowa in December that he would like to end
child labor laws: "It is tragic what we do in the
poorest neighborhoods, entrapping children
in child laws which are truly stupid ... These
schools should get rid of unionized janitors,
have one master janitor, pay local students to
take care of the school."
There you have it. Direct from the candi-
dates themselves. Hopefully these quotations
will help you make your decision when you
vote in November.

Before I get to the main topic
of this column, I should say
that I realize how tricky
writing an arti-
cle about race
can be. Some
of my regular
conservative
readers might
say I've already
failed at writ-
ing about race DAR-WEI
in some of my CHEN
previous col-
umns where I
insinuate that
the modern Republican Party is
somewhat racist. (I stand by my
opinions, by the way.) In spite of
these issues, I want to take this
opportunity to discuss political
correctness in the case of the New
York Knicks point guard Jeremy
Shu-How Lin.
If you've been living under a
rock, Jeremy Lin is the NBA's most
recent revelation, taking the league
by storm in the past couple of weeks
with his scintillating performanc-
es. He has quickly risen to inter-
national stardom while famously
living on his brother's couch.
The first thing you might have
noticed when you heard about Lin
is his last name and the fact that
he's Asian American. I don't blame
you, because his race was the first
thing I noticed too. In today's polit-
ically correct world, this admis-
sion might not be very popular and
could be construed as racist, espe-
cially by Asians. However, I'm not
offended if someone tells me he or
she notices Lin's race first before
anything else, especially because
his race is a lot easier to notice than
his other features that distinguish
him from many NBA players: hav-
ing a Harvard degree, being cut
twice by NBA teams, etc.
Noticing Lin's race first and fore-

most is merely a reflection of the
fact that basketball is a sport where
less than 0.5 percent of its men's
NCAA Division I players are Asian.
It's an exercise in pattern recogni-
tion and nothing to be offended
about.
Even a widely-criticized obser-
vation by champion boxer Floyd
Mayweather via Twitter - "Jeremy
Lin is a good player, but all the hype
is because he's Asian. Black players
do what he does every night and
don't get the same praise" - is not
racist because it's largely true. Of
course, Lin's meteoric rise doesn't
stem solely from race; playing in
the glitzy New York market always
helps, and the current lull in the
sports calendar has enabled him to
shine. Mayweather should also note
that Lin was overlooked in the first
place precisely because of race -
Lin captained his high school team
to a California state championship
but amazingly received no Divi-
sion I scholarship offers - which
would explain the suddenness of
his ascent to the upper echelon of
NBA superstars.
Nevertheless, Mayweather
is right. Would former Houston
Rockets all-star center Yao Ming
have been nearly as popular inter-
nationally if he wasn't Chinese?
Of course not. The league has had
plenty of players who can aver-
age 20 points and 10 rebounds
per game - Yao's race undeniably
boosted his profile because it's
unique in basketball and helped
many fans identify with him. And
such an observation isn't racist
because, much like noticing Lin's
race as his most salient feature on
the court, it doesn't imply any infe-
riority of the Asian race in terms of
athleticism. The only implication is
that Asians tend not to pursue bas-
ketball as intently as others might
and are therefore not expected to

compete at the highest levels of the
sport.
Don't get me wrong, Lin's rise
has exposed some latent Asian rac-
ism in the U.S. For example, dur-
ing his time at Harvard, Lin would
hear taunts from opposing fans
about how he should be at orchestra
practice. Even the media - which
should be more mature than drunk
college students - has had its racist
moments, such as an ESPN headline
reading "Chink in the Armor" after
the Knicks' first Lin-era loss last
weekend or a Fox Sports reporter
tweeting, "Some lucky lady in NYC
is gonna feel a couple of inches of
pain tonight," after Lin scored 38
points in a win against the Lakers
on Feb. 10. These instances either
degrade Asians in some way or use
Not every
comment about
race is insulting. 0
racial slurs.
But not every comment regard-
ing race is worth being insulted by.
-Sometimes the U.S. is too politi-
cally correct and the mindset can
detract from the country's enjoy-
ment of someone like Lin. Watching
him size up a defender like Carmelo
Anthony and probe the paint like
Steve Nash is wonderful for basket-
ball junkies like me. And Lin's story
is great too. Let's relish what we
have in Jeremy Lin now and save
the politically correct indignation
for later.

The truth about Santorum

MOHAMMED-ALl ABAZEED |
Protesting for peace

Do you support public education? Do you
believe in evolution? Do you believe in global
warming? Do you believe in providing women
the choice.to use contraception and birth con-
trol? Apparently, Rick Santorum might not.
Do you believe we should abolish courts we
disagree with and send the judges to Guam?
Do you believe homosexuality is on the same
level as rape or incest and that parents can lead
their children into a particular sexual orienta-
tion? Doyou believe that we should bomb Iran
and hope for the best? Apparently, Rick San-
torum does.
I came to the University from a public ele-
mentary school and a public high school in
Erie, Penn. I graduated from our "public ivy"
last year with a B.A. from the Ford School of
Public Policy. Because of my public education,
I'm now lucky enough to be a first-year student
at Harvard University's Law School, undoubt-
edly the Michigan of the East.
I mean it when I say I am lucky, because my
public schools provided me with a great edu-
cation and seven better group of friends. Not a
day goes by when I do not wish I were in Ann
Arbor.
Somehow, I think I have come out as a "fair-
ly normal" young adult, despite the "weird
socialization" that Santorum believes students
in public schools receive. These are exact
words from his book.
I write today as a native Pennsylvanian who
feels a duty to tell voters in Michigan about the
views of my former senator. Santorum served
my state for 12 years, and left as a divisive fig-
ure. You may or may not agree with him, but
that's not the point I want to make. When
Republicans go to the polls next week for
the Michigan primary, the point is that they
should know what they're getting into.

Santorum, who lost by nearly 20 points in
his and my home state, would like us to think
he wants to represent everyone, rich or poor -
not the one percent or 99 percent, but 100 per-
cent of America. That claim deserves further
examination. He mightbe forthe 100 percent,
except for those families that cannot afford
private schools and rely on our public educa-
tion system to teach their children. He might
be for the 100 percent, except for the millions
of LGBTQ Americans who would lose their
rights in Santorum's ideal world. He might be
for the 100 percent, except for scientists who
warn us about the effects of climate change
and doctors .who help women pick the best
medical options.
In addition, Santorum's social views are
well known. Some argue that social issues
shouldn't define a presidential campaign,
because one's positions won't really affect the
norms of this country. But when one has views
like Santorum, we cannot hold them to be
meaningless. If elected, Santorum will surely
voice these ideas from the bully pulpit. Ameri-
cans give our blessing to what a newly elected
president represents. The symbolism of hav-
ing someone who voices his support for rather
extreme positions cannot, under any circum-
stances, be discounted.
I hope Michigan voters evaluate the Repub-
lican candidates based on character and objec-
tive criteria - they have every right to vote for
whomever they choose. I am not a Michigan
voter. I admit freely that I speak from the oui-
side. But I ask, as a fellow American, that Mich-
igan voters talk to each other and be honest
about what part of the 100 percent Santorum
really wants to represent in Washington, D.C.

Khader Adnan, a 33-year-old Palestinian man, just
completed a hunger strike of 66 days. Israeli forces
arrested Adnan on Dec. 17, 2011 in the middle of the
night at his home in the Palestinian village of Arraba.
Following 18 days of torture and humiliation, Adnan
was imprisoned without charge or trial. Israel's practice
of administrative detention - allowing authorities to
detain individuals indefinitely without any requirement
to charge - stands in direct violation of international
law, which states that this form of detention is allowed
only in certain circumstances. However, B'Tselem, the
Israeli Information Center for Human Rights, states,
"Israel's use of administrative detention blatantly vio-
lates these restrictions. It is carried out under the thick
cover of privilege, which denies detainees the possibility
of mounting a proper defense."
In protest of his treatment, Adnan began a hunger
strike the day after his arrest. The group Physicians for
Human Rights said after visiting him in a hospital thathe
had lost more than one-third of his weight, was weak and
frail, but was still being shackled to his bed. After refusal
to grant Adnan a court date for weeks, Israel's high court
agreed to hear his case on his 66th day of protest. His
hunger strike ended when the court decided not to renew
Adnan's detention, a minimum requirement asked for
Adnan himself.
Though Western media has been nearly silent on his
story, Adnan has become an international symbol of
resistance to injustice through grassroots movements
and social media, which have launched many campaigns
to shed light on his story. Calls for release or immediate
charge of Adnan and 300 other administrative detainees
from human rights bodies around the world went largely
unnoticed and ignored.
But the family of Adnan continued to amplify his call,
even reaching out to the family of an Israeli soldier, Gilad
Shalit. Shalit was held by Hamas in captivity for several
years and was released earlier this year following intense
international pressure. Shalit was released as part of an
arranged prisoner swap. His father said, according to an
Oct. 18, 2011 BBC News article, "We're concluding a long
and difficult journey. We're glad that we won our son
back." Adnan's father recently asked according to Jus-
tInternational.org, "Where are the mother and father of
Gilad Shalit? Do they not feel for me inthis humanitarian
case?" Though moral measurements of humanity may
not apply to decisions Israel makes, surely the anguish
and sorrow a father feels for his son is a universal feel-

ing. The case of Adnan exploits the hypocrisy that exists
in the Westbetween the dignity of an Israeli soldier cap-
tured in a battle and that of a Palestinian prisoner taken
from his home in the middle of the night.
Yet the case of Adnan brings to the forefront the bru-
tal reality of an ongoing occupation. The inhumane and
degrading treatment of Adnan is a reality shared by Pal-
estinians who face an oppressive occupation that con-
tinues to strip away their rights on a daily basis. While
the world continues to call on both sides to re-engage in
a peace process, Israel continues to expand its colonizing
settlements - apractice even the United States deems
illegal - encroaching on the right of the Palestinian
people to self-determination. In a letter released by his
lawyers, Adnan addresses the Palestinian people: "The
Israeli occupation has gone to extremes against our peo-
ple, especially prisoners. I have been humiliated, beaten,
and harassed by interrogators for no reason, and thus I
swore to God I would fight the policy of administrative
detention to which Iand hundreds of my fellow prisoners
fell prey."
And so, Adnan fought using the only tool he had
left at his disposal: his body. In Ireland, IRA prisoners
fought back against the British Empire in 1981 by begin-
ning hunger strikes. Bobby Sands, the man who led the
charge, died after 66 days of refusing food. Nine died
following him, but their actions changed the face of
the conflict and set in motion the peace agreement that
prevails in Northern Ireland today. A film director who
portrayed their story said of their actions, "It is the final
act of desperation. Your own body is your last resource
for protest."
So, Adnan continues to protest, and as he does, I'm
reminded of a question I too often hear: "Where are the
Palestinian Gandhis, the Palestinian Martin Luther King
Jrs., who will nonviolently lead the charge to liberation
and freedom?" To this I say: The Palestinian Khader
Adnans are alive and they exist. They are in every block
of Gaza, on every street corner of Ramallah. They exist in
the bravery of Rachel Corrie, in the strength of Vittorio
Arrigoni and in the courage of Mustafa Tamimi. They
are in Israel's prison cells, in every cell of every child
born into occupation. They are in the hearts of all human
beings of conscience, who dream of a day that the arc of
the moral universe may finally set itself on the battered

within a single
day's time.
Basement Arts, a student-run
theater organization that has
presented free theater for over
20 years to both the University
and Ann Arbor, is presenting the
show at the Walgreen Drama
Center this Thursday and Fri-
day. This Tony Award and
Pulitzer Prize-winning drama,
written by Michael Cristofer
in 1977, takes place in separate
cabins on the grounds of a large
hospital.
Three cancer patients - Joe,
Brian and Felicity - are living
with their respective families
as they reach the end of their
treatment and participate in
interviews with a psychiatrist.
The Interviewer enhances their
dialogues, flowing seamlessly
between the serious and often
humorous moments that sur-
round the idea of mortality.
MT&D junior Derek Joseph
Tran makes his directorial
debut with "The Shadow Box,"
which he hopes will accurately
portray the struggle of coping
with death.
"The play revolves around
hope," Tran said. "Each patient
progresses through five stages
(of grief): denial, anger, bargain-
ing, depression and acceptance.
While they are all staggered in
their stages, they share the com-
mon ground of hope."
The play focuses on those
hard, emotional conversations
that evoke the reality of its topic.
As the day ends, no moral dilem-
mas have been solved, no one
has died, and no one is going to
live forever.

inferences led him to this question

"The Shadow Box" tells the stories of three patients battling cancer

ciated works intended to be
appreciated together, presents
reality, selecting three radically
different people who all share
the same future, whether they
are terminal or not.
Tran highlighted the charac-
ter of Felicity, one of the big per-
sonalities of story.'
"She is seen as hateful
because she is in the anger stage.
But you feel pity and sympa-
thize, because even though she
is constantly spewing venom,
you somehow find the positive,"
he said.
Celebrated by critics for
its intuition, shrewdness and
humor in dealing with a con-
troversial subject matter, Tran
stressed the importance of the
comedy of tragedy, hoping oth-
ers will agree that it is human
nature to use laughter as a cop-
ing mechanism across awkward
situations.
Tran also stressed the use
of realism in this version of the
play.
"The set and costume design

remain simple, so as not to dis-
tract from the experimental act-
ing involved," Tran said.
"Time isn't relevant. Despite
technological advances, the
psychological feeling of death
approaching will always be the
same," he said.
As an actor and an author,
Cristofer adapted the play for a
TV movie in 1980, directed by
Paul Newman, which went on
to garner three Emmy nomina-
tions and a win a Golden Globe.
According to Tran, even those
lucky enough to be unpracticed
in the loss of a loved one can
relate to this story: Regardless
of the circumstances, the differ-
ence between being sympathetic
and empathetic is palpable, and
it is found on the stage.
Death is the one common
concern we all live with, the one
certainty in an uncertain world.
"The Shadow Box" aims to drive
this point home, inciting audi-
ences to at least confront those
difficult situations with a few
laughs.

If there's one thing Hollywood - everything from tan lines on his
is obsessed with, it's reimagining wrists to how he stands - is cop-
what has been done before. Why ied almost verbatim from Doyle's

Scarlet") or "A Scandal in Belgra-
via" ("A Scandal in Bohemia"). At
their first meeting, Sherlock asks

to not be thoroughly repelled by
the arrogance that accompanies
Sherlock's unnerving brilliance.
The fun part of setting the show
in the current era is that people
aren't embarrassed to ask if
Sherlock and John are dating -
or to just go ahead and assume
they're a couple. After a while,
John stops denying it, especial-
ly when his string of relation-
ships fail because all girlfriends
play second fiddle to Sherlock
Holmes.
And of course, no version of
"Sherlock Holmes" would be
complete without the detective's
arch-nemesis, James Moriarty
(Andrew Scott, "John Adams").
Ritchie's films depict a Moriarty
that is Sherlock's intellectual
equal, but what they don't show
is how utterly deranged he is.
Scott plays Moriarty without any
restraint, creating an unhinged
image of chaos, much like Heath
Ledger's Joker.
Scott's unsettling sadism adds
to the chemistry of a fantasti-
cally three-dimensional cast of
characters. Cumberbatch and
Freeman play Sherlock and John
so naturally that they feel like
friends from the "moment they
meet. Gatiss doubles as Mycroft
Holmes, coldly indifferent but
also grappling with how to take
care of his little brother. When
Lana Pulver ("True Blood")
shows up as Irene Adler in sea-
son two, the sexual tension
between her and Sherlock is
so palpable that it practically
jumps out of the screen.
Allow me to take a leaf out
of the Reichenbach hero's book
and speak to you in simple facts:
Sherlock is the bestshow ontele-
vision. It's perfectly cast, expert-
ly written, stunningly acted and
just a pleasure to watch. If only
all shows could be on this level.
Then again, if it were ordinary,
it wouldn't be "Sherlock," would

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
CSG resolution supports
student-parent subsidies

Assembly wants
'U' to eliminate
restrictions on
childcare subsidies
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily Staff Reporter
The Central Student Gov-
ernment's assembly meeting
last night was considerably
louder than previous meet-
ings because of the children
brought with graduate stu-
dents who addressed the
assembly.
The group of graduate stu-
dents came to support a reso-
lution passed by the assembly
last night that will support the
removal of a requirement of a
limitation on childcare subsi-
dies provided to them by the
University. Currently there
is a restriction that requires
graduate students' spouses
to work or study a combined
20 hours per week to receive
childcare from the University.
The resolution also pledged
$35,000 to the implementa-
tion of program without this
requirement.
Rackham student Katie Brion
came with her three sons and
spoke to the assembly about the
spousal work-study require-
ment.
"We saw it as a social equi-
ty issue," Brion said. "Even
though it's maybe a small num-
ber of students that are affect-
ed, we think they're affected in
a really disproportionate way."
Rackham student Dan-

iel Birchok also attended the
meetingwith his young daugh-
ter.
"The subsidy has been
incredibly important for me,"
Birchok said. "I wouldn't be as
close to finishing (my degree)
now as I am without (it), and I
wouldn't have been to teach as
well as I did last term because
you're pulled in so many direc-
tions (when you have chil-
dren)."
Both Birchok and Brion had
access to the childcare subsi-
dies but said they knew other
student-parents that did not.
"The people who are least
able to absorb the costs on
their own are the ones that get
excluded," Birchok said.
A proposal to create a week-
ly news reportathat covers the
assembly was also passed last
night. LSA sophomore Tyler
Mesman, an LSA represen-
tative who co-authored the
proposal, said the report will
be sent to those interested
through a group e-mail.
"It's a great benefit to the
students so that they can really
be aware of what's going on in
the assembly," Mesman said.
"The students really should
know what's going on and
what matters affect them."
Another resolution pro-
posed would allow CSG to
appoint a representative for
the School of Music, Theatre
& Dance. Engineering repre-
sentative Zeid El-Kilani, co-
author of the resolution, said
because the School of Music,
Theatre & Dance doesn't have
a student government, it can-
not appoint its own represen-

tative.
"Currently they don't have
a student government," El-
Kilani said. "That absence is
two-folded. Right now they
pay $7.19 to the Central Stu-
dent Government and they
don't have representation on
that and then again they're
supposed to pay $1.50 for the
school (for a student govern-
ment)."
El-Kilani added that Music,
Theatre & Dance students are
"losing.out on services and a
voice to the administration."
The assembly also proposed
a bill to award $1,775 to pay for
a bus to take students to the
U.S. 6th Circuit Court in Cin-
cinnati on March 7. On that
day, BAMN v. Regents of the
University of Michigan will be
reheard after being previously
appealed. This case concerns
the legality of Proposal 2, the
2006 amendment to the Michi-
gan Constitution that banned
the use of affirmative action in
the admissions process at pub-
lic universities.
LSA junior Ariam Abraham
came to the meeting in support
of the resolution. Abraham, a
member of eRACism - a Uni-
versity organization dedicated
to fighting racism on the Uni-
versity campus and advocating
for affirmative action - said
more than 80 students are
expected to attend this event.
"So many students have
expressed such a great inter-
est in being part of this move-
ment," Abraham said. "It
would be a great way to ... re-
energize social activism and
student involvement in issues

Finance Minister Evangelos
Venizelos said the agreement

The agreement was the second

Greece eurol30 billion in loans

wage, imposed by countries sus-
picious of Greece's reform efforts
after two years of what they called
the country's broken promises.

MARATHON
From Page 1A
Additional charities are invited
to register race participants as an
independent fund-raising oppor-
tunity. At the meeting, Council
unanimously passed a resolution
to close the streets on the race's
route.
Marathon organizer Michael
Highfield, founder of Champi-
ons for Charity said Council's
approval was the final step before
public event announcements
could be made.
Highfield said the approval
means updated details about the
marathon course will be released
online sometime today.
"We waited (to release an
updated course) until city coun-
cil approval because we tweaked
the course and the startingltime,"
Highfield said.
Highfield, an avid runner,
developed the idea for the mara-
thon after receiving a call from
his friend Ellie Serras, a leader
of the Main Street Area Associa-
tion, who thought Ann Arbor was
fit for a marathon because of its
status as a health-conscious com-
munity.
The marathon has a registra-
tion limit of 2,500 participants,
while a corresponding half-mar-
athon has a cap of 5,000 runners.
Abost 751 people from 26 differ-
ent states have already registered
for the race.
Highfield said he worked with
the cityto develop acourse incor-
porating some of Ann Arbor's
notable landmarks includ-
ing Michigan Stadium, Burton
Tower, the Law Quadrangle, Yost
Ice Arena, the Michigan Union
and the Matthaei Botanical Gar-
dens and Nichols Arboretum.
Wendy Correll, executive
director of Ann Arbor Public
Schools Educational Foundation,
said the event will help the orga-
nization reach its annual fund-
raising goal of $1 million.
"This is the third year we're
having a campaign to raise $1
million for Ann Arbor Public
Schools," Correll said. "I think
with the funding that will come
with the marathon we'll hit that
$1 million mark."
Correll said her organization
benefits educational programs in
Ann Arbor schools that are being
cut due to financial difficulties.
"In order to keep the AP class-

es...to provide adequate aademic
support for struggling students,
you've got to find funding some-
where because it's disappearing."
Correll said her foundation
would use funds raised to ensure
students at all Ann Arbor public
schools have equal opportunities.
"We can't fix inequity, but we
won't perpetuate it," Correll said,
"If there's a good program for
third-graders, every third-grader
in our district is goingto get it."
Correll said Council's compli-
ance with the city's marathon
requirements will help Ann
Arbor's public schools.
"In many cities across the
country, the cities are giving
money to schools for education
programs.'fhatmdoesn't happen
here, the economy doesn't allow
it, so this is one way they can sup-
port education without having to
fork over cash," Correll said.
She added that the event will
benefit Ann Arbor businesses as
well.
"Right off the bat it was clear,
the Convention and Visitors
Bureau had to buy into this and
like it because if we have people
coming from 26 different states,
they are going to stay some-
where," Correll said.
Correll said she is hopeful the
event will becomes an annual
summer tradition in Ann Arbor.
"There will come a point five
or six years downthe road where
this will be a draw like the Art
Fair," she said.
Councilmember Jane Lumm
(I-Ward 2) said Council was
completely supportive of the
event.
"They've been working on
this for months." Lumm said. "It
is a huge deal, as a non-runner
I didn't appreciate everything
that goes into this...Meeting
with all these organizations,
churches - this marathon will be
on a Sunday, emergency routes,
I'm really impressed with all the
work they've done."
Christy Perros, an Education-
al Foundation board member,
spoke before Council to tell them
the Ann Arbor marathon would
be her first
Michael Benson, president of
Rackham Student Government,
said he will make sure Universi-
ty graduate students lend a help-
ing hand with the race.

nitely be here June 17 and we can

Treais snacks, snipes for Michigan Blue struggles in
By ZACH HELFAND/Buetruggls in
Daily Sports Editor 1'*Dir--- Rrr ( lE j

Shawn Hunwick was tired of
answering the same questions.
During the Michigan hockey
team's bye week about a month
ago, with storylines scarce, Hun-
wick heard the same questions
day after day. So he had a sugges-
tion.
"Hey, why don't you write
about A.J. Treais?" Hunwick
said,
"Why Treais?"
"I don't know," Hunwick said
with a shrug and a grin. "He's
weird."
For some reason, the story
never made it to print. Yet Hun-
wick was onto something. No,
not that Treais is weird - that's
just one man's opinion.
Rather, there just wasn't much
else to say about Treais.
At the time, the junior for-
ward had just been through a
barren 17-game stretch during
which he tallied just three goals.
Outside of the rink, though,
life wasn't quite so desolate. In
fact, it was downright flush -
with food. So much so that in
January, Treais gained more
pounds (10) than points (two).
"I was on him about his
weight," said Michigan coach
Red Berenson. "Five pounds for
a hockey player is like you carry-
ing 25 pounds around your neck.
Five pounds just kills you."
Since then, Treais has shrunk,
while his stats have exploded. At
Berenson's urging, he has begun
a diet that has helped him shed
seven pounds in February ("No
Fat Tuesday for me," he joked).
On the ice, Treais has erupt-
ed for 10 points in six games,
including the overtime game-
winning goal on Saturday, in
what has become the best stretch
of his college career. This is the
Treais that Berenson recruited,
the player on the U.S. Develop-
mental Team - one that includ-
ed junior forward Chris Brown
and senior forward David Wohl-
berg - who most impressed the
Michigan coaches.
The talent never diminished,
but he lacked a killer instinct.
The perpetually laid-back kid
sometimes remained too relaxed
on the ice for Berenson's liking.
"I like the fact that A.J. is
maybe easygoing and laid-back,"
Berenson said. "But when he
puts his uniform on, we need

Treais said he doesn't think
his behavior has changed since
his hot streak began. And over-
all, Treais remains an easy, fun
presence on the ice. ("I mean,
this is college hockey, this isn't
the pros or anything," Treais
said).
The difference in Treais
evades portrayal, but Glendening
thinks he has it down.
"This is going to be hard to
explain, but just bear with me
and maybe it'll flesh out in the
end," Glendening said. "His laid-
back (attitude) and the way he
plays, that's kind of just who he
is, that's nothing he can change.
But there's intensity through
that. It's a quiet intensity. He's
not the one yelling, he's not the
one getting on guys, but he's the
one just leading through the way
he's playing, and I think that's
how he's intense."
Throughout the season,
Treais played plus hockey. But
after three years, Treais has
finally taken his game to another
level, and all it took was a diet
and some fire.
Weird, huh?

Michigan finishes
13th in pool of 15
teams, including
No.I1 Texas
By PETER BROWN
For the Daily
The Michigan men's golf
team traveled to Rio Grande,
Puerto Rico on Sunday to com-
pete in the Puerto Rico Classic
- a three-day stroke-play event
played at the River Course at
Rio Mar Country Club. To put
it simply: things did not go as
planned.
The field was packed with
formidable opponents.
Eight of the 15 teams in
attendance were ranked in
Golfweek's top 50 - three were
in the top 10, including No. 1
Texas. It was most likely the
toughest field Michigan will
face all season.
But Michigan coach Chris
Whitten was confident in his
team's play heading into Sun-
day's first round.
"We've gone to Puerto Rico
for several years in a row,"
Whitten said. "We were excited
to go down and play a course
that we were familiar with."
But on day one, the Wolver-
ines struggled, shooting an
18-over-par team total of 306,
30 strokes behind eventual
champion Alabama. Michigan
finished the day tied for 14th
along with East Tennessee
State. Senior Matt Thompson
fired a team-best, one-under-
par 71, while juniors Miguel
Echavarria and Matt Alessi shot
rounds of 77 and 78, respec-
tively. Freshman Noori Hyun
rounded out Michigan's top
four with an 80.-
"We just came out flat (on
Sunday), and probably a little
bit tentative," Whitten said.
"There's no particular reason
for it."
Monday's second round
wasn't any better. The Wolver-
ines shot a lethargic 309, with
their best scores again coming
from Thompson and Echavarria
with matching 76s. Thompson,
in particular, was dissatisfied
with his performance.
"I was a little disappointed,"
Thompson said. "I thought I
was playing a lot better than I
shot."
Day three was a bit more
positive for Michigan, as it fin-
ished off the tournament with a
12-over-par total of 300.
"I think the guys felt more
comfortable each day, and we

played a better round (on Tues-
day)," Whitten said. "We had a
couple guys make some really
nice progress throughout the
week."
Echavarria finished his
week with a solid one-over-par
73, while Hyun carded a 71,
his first-ever collegiate round
under par.
"(Hyun's) ball-striking has
really been good for a long time
now," Whitten said. "I think he
needed to get his short game
matching where his long game
was. His chip shots, pitch shots
and putting were all a lot better
(on Tuesday)."
Thompson spoke highly of
the freshman.
"This (tournament) will
definitely help his confidence,"
Thompson said. "That's huge
for him, it being his first year.
Hopefully he can carry that to
next week."
And even though it's only
his first season at the helm,
Whitten is wise enough not to
panic, even when his team lead-
ers, Thompson and junior Jack
Schultz, are struggling. Schultz
had a particularly frustrating
performance - he didn't break
80 all week - but Whitten's
confidence is unwavering.
"This week was a strange
one for Jack," Whitten said. "It
doesn't show who he is at all.
I'm sure he'll be able to forget
it. He'll move on and play well
again right away. It won't be a
problem."
In the end, the Alabama
squad proved to be too domi-
nant for the rest of the field.
The Crimson Tide finished at
an astounding 30-under-par
three-day total. Its nearest
competitor, Clemson, was 18
strokes behind at 12-under.
Alabama's Justin Thomas
won the individual-trophy witha
a 10-under-par total, while
Michigan's leader, Thompson,
finished tied for 39th place with
a six-over-par total.
The Wolverines saw a couple
of familiar faces in Puerto Rico
as well, including former coach
Andrew Sapp, now the head
coach at North Carolina, and
former Wolverine Joey Garber,
who transferred to Georgia fol-
lowing his freshman season.
Sapp's Tar Heels finished in a
tie for 13th in the team stand-
ings with Michigan, while Gar-
her finished tied for 19th as an
individual shooting an even-par
total for the three-day event.
Michigan travels to Los
Angeles next week for the North
Ranch Collegiate at North
Ranch Country Club. The two-
day event starts on Monday.


Graduate assistant Lovelace knows
other side of Michigan-Purdue tilt

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Writer
Purdue isn't simply another
opponent on the Michigan wom-
en's basketball schedule.
Yes, the Wolverines host the
Boilermakers on Thursday for
senior night, but the school
located in West Lafayette reso-
nates in other ways with some-
one involved with the Wolverine
squad.
It's not a player, coach, or train-
er.
It's the team's graduate assis-
tant, Stacey Lovelace.
Lovelace was a highly recruit-
ed player coming out of Detroit's
St. Martin De Porres High School
and chose to play college ball
at Purdue, turning down offers
from several other Big Ten
schools. The Boilermakers had
just won a Big Ten champion-
ship the year before (1991), so the
6-foot-4 center decided to com-
mit to a program where success
was standard.
But that success she wanted to
be a part of would have to wait for
a year. Lovelace was thrust into a
starting position despite her inex-
perience though she was glad her
coach, Lin Dunn, had faith in her
as a freshman through the team's
struggles that year. The 1992-93
team went 16-11.
"(Dunn) instilled a lot of trust
in me," Lovelace said. "When I
played as a freshman, I was by
no stretch ready to play in the Big
Ten, but she gave me an oppor-
tunity to still play. ... It made me
realize (what) I needed to work
on and get better at."

Her improvements were imme- because of the foundations laid by

es when needed in addition to
offering advice to the squad.
"I'm very limited as far as my
role with the team because being
a graduate assistant, I can't really
do any coaching," Lovelace said.
"There's not much I can do as
far as their skills, but just listen-
ing and talking to them and let-
ting them know things can turn
around. ... (I've) been where they
want to be, been to where they
are now."
Those words of wisdom sound
like what a coach would tell her
players.
"I wasn't really trying to get
into the coaching business,"
Lovelace said. "But I figured
(that) at the end of this, I would
know if I wanted to do coaching
or wanted to go business, and
either way I'd be fine.
"But being here and being

girls that are in this situation, so
I feel I can make the most impact
as a coach. I think they relate to
me, I relate to them, (and) I think
that it would be a natural fit for
me. So I think I am going to pur-
sue coaching. (But) right now I'm
working towards my masters,
and once that's over I probably
will go into coaching."
She may not become Purdue's
next head coach, but Lovelace
is still proud of her alma mater.
She's impressed with what Boil-
ermakers coach Sharon Versyp
has done with the program and
hopes that Purdue will continue
to maintain a high standard of
excellence - just as Dunn did
when Lovelace played.

Wolverines started falling
behind on defense in the face
of Northwestern's Princeton

and switching into unfavorable

Beilein told his players repeat-

team began to attack the zone
efficiently, moving the ball more
quickly, getting the ball inside,
even if for a brief moment, and
penetrating enough to draw
defenders away from the 3-point
line.
It was Burke himself who
stood up at halftime to encour-
age his teammates. He lamented
how the Wolverines always say

Burke led them in that effort,
and the shots began to fall

moments.

points. "We worked on it here

But they buckled down on
defense in the second half and
overtime.
On offense, led by Burke -
who played the entire game
- and a never-stop-shooting
attitude, Michigan kept its bear-
ing, turning the ball over just
seven times.
"(Against the 1-3-1), what you
have to have is not schematic,"
Beilein said.
"It's a bunch of guys who see
the floor, who can all pass, and
are going to be selfless in their
game. ... We shot 38 (3-pointers),

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Editor
EVANSTON - Just 15 seconds
into the game, redshirt sopho-
more center Jordan Morgan
picked up a foul.
A few minutes later, senior
guard Zack Novak, and Morgan's
replacement, sophomore for-
ward Evan Smotrycz, picked up
consecutive fouls. The next play,
Smotrycz fouled again. After
Morgan re-replaced Smotrycz,
Morgan fouled again.
Six minutes of the game had
elapsed, and both big men had
two fouls, reaching the number
that usually causes Michigan
coach John Beilein to sit the play-
er for the rest of the half.
"If you look at the old Princ-
eton teams ... it was more of a
passing offense," Beilein said,
describing Northwestern's evolv-
ing offense. "They really drove
it at us and drove it at us and the
officials started calling it very
tight. It was the right calls. Foul
trouble hurt us in the first half."
Amid the carnage, Beilein
needed production from his
bench if the Wolverines wanted
to stay in the game.
Beilein has sparsely used his
bench in conference play this
season. In past games when Mor-
gan has fouled early, Beilein has
depended on Smotrycz to replace
him. But this time around, with
Smotrycz also in foul trouble,
Beilein was handcuffed. Novak
also had to sit for seven minutes
in the first half.
"Those things are going to
happen," Beilein said. "It's sud-
den change, and you just need to
adjust to it."
Enter junior guard Matt
Vogrich, who was playing just a
half-hour away from his home-
town.
"It was awesome," said the
Lake Forest, Ill. native. "My AAU
coach was here, my family, my
friends."
With the starting frontcourt
forced to the bench, Vogrich
sparked the Wolverines with
valuable minutes off the bench.
His nine points on three 3-point-
ers gave Michigan the spurts it
needed in the decisive overtime
victory.
"That was big for him to come
off the bench," Beilein said. "He's

been a big part of this little surge
that we're having right now. All
year long, we've struggled at
times with our bench play. We
needed that. He's done a good
job."
After missing his first two
shots, Vogrich buried two
straight 3-pointers to extend the
Michigan lead to six.
With Morgan and Smotrycz
limited to playing just six minutes
in the first half, Michigan was
forced to go with a smaller lineup.
Vogrich and junior forward Blake
McLimans were forced to see
their longest stretches of playing
time in Big Ten competition.
Despite Vogrich's efforts, the
foul trouble came back to haunt
the Wolverines.
The 19-13 lead that Vogrich had
given Michigan quickly deterio-
rated, as the Wildcats went on an
18-5 run and took a 31-24 lead into
halftime.
In a low-scoring second half,
the Wolverines inched their way
back. But another Novak foul -
his third - thrust Vogrich back
into the game.
The hometown kid came up
big again, banging home another
3-pointer from the cornerto erase
Michigan's halftime deficit and
give Michigan a 39-38 advantage.
It was the Wolverines' first lead
since it was 19-17.
"He's really rolling right now,"
Novak said. "Really just shoot-
ing the crap out of the ball. That's
huge for us."
Neither team would lead by
more than four until the Wolver-
ines broke it open in overtime to
win 67-55.
Vogrich has found a hot streak
recently, making three of four
3-point attempts at Nebraska two
weeks ago and making both of
his tries behind the arc at home
against Illinois two weekends
ago. However, in both of those
contests, Michigan was already
leading comfortably when
Vogrich got hot. This time, it was
different.
In this game, in front of his
friends and family, he made the
shots when they counted.
"These are games where
there's a little something extra
there," Novak said. "Whether
it's the school that passed you up
or a school you have a bunch of
friends that go to. It's snecial."

Have you heard of a bank called TCF?
Or perhaps a better question -
have you heard of any other?
About 20,000 University students current-
ly have TCF Totally Free Student Checking
accounts linked to their Mcards, according
to Bob Borgstrom, executive vice president
and director of branch tanking at TCF Bank.
Last year, TCF was voted best bank in 2011 by
readers of The Michigan Daily.
Appearances suggest TCF is the leader
and best in Ann Arbor student banking.
A simple Google search, however, tells
another story. Negative reviews abound on
RipoffReport.com, a website where custom-
ers can file reports over the Internet about
scams, frauds and bad service experienced
at companies. On Yelp, where the public can
review businesses, the TCF branch location
on South University Avenue earns an average
of one star out of five. There is even a website
dedicated to negative TCF reviews.
Complaints about TCF range from com-
plaints about the "turtle speeds" of the tell-
ers to the overdraft fees to the apparent
difficulty of closing an account.
One Yelp user said of the TCF branch loca-
tion on South University Avenue, "If the TCF
stands for Truly Crappy Financial services,
then I'd say that the people who founded this
bank aptly named it."
TCF is the most prevalent bank within
walking distance of the University campus,
with five branches and 25 ATMs on campus
and around Ann Arbor. Most students hold
the TCF Totally Free Student Checking
Account, advertised on the website as "easy
to use and provid(ing) the convenience nec-
essary for busy students," with no minimum

nance fees and the option to use Mcards as
ATM/debit cards. With a $25 opening bal-
ance, these new accountholders can earn a

the TCF logo.
However, what the website does not pub-
licize is that these checking accounts do not

Whereas most other banks would charge a

es overdraft fees by the day.
Thus, if someone overdrafted today but
didn't discover it until three days later, that
person would be $84 in the red. Compared
to most banks - where there's a standard
$35 charge - this seems pretty steep to some
students.

Korstange said TCF Bank took negative
reviews very seriously and tried to model
fees to be comparable to its competition.
"What we try to do is look at the major
banks in the area and then try to be just
below those," he said. "We try to review the
market and try to be just below what our
competition is."
Business Prof. Scott Rick - who's writ-
ten a number of journal articles on personal
finance - said banks have always offered
plans to entice students with benefits like
free checking because banks are confident
they will make their money back when
accountholders make mistakes.
"You take a loss initially on the free
account, but you more than make it up with
the fees later," Rick said.
Central Michigan University alum
Andrew Bennett, who used TCF Bank while
living in Ann Arbor, also said he does not rec-
ommend that anyone use TCF's services.
"The fees were both hefty and numer-
ous, and seemed to constantly be on the
rise," Bennett wrote in an e-mail interview.
"Between the fees and my dissatisfaction
with their 'customer service' during my
years with a TCF account, I was eventually
convinced to drop them as my bank."
Rick advises that students carefully moni-
tor their money and be "vigilant."
"Just understand what the banks are get-
ting out of this, which is either loyalty, and/
or they're waiting for you to trip up," Rick
said.

Absorption of a role often includes
immersion in the troubled psyche of a fic-
tional character, which can prove exhaust-
ing for actors.
To embody the role of the emaciated
insomniac Trevor Reznik in "The Machin-
ist," Christian Bale stuck to a bare-bones
diet that atrophied his body so rapidly, he
weighed only 121 pounds by the time film-
ing was completed. Immediately after, he
was cast as Bruce Wayne in Christopher
Nolan's "Batman" series and gained more
than 100 pounds in six months to meet a
tight production deadline.
And though the immersive experiences
of students majoring in musical theatre
aren't extreme enough to put life or limb in
jeopardy, they can occasionally bring out an
actor's dark side.
"When you live with a character for two
months, it's hard not to get close to them,"
Tamaren said. "When I played Ivy in'Bare:
A Pop Opera,' it was hard to leave rehears-
als feeling happy or normal - you get so
invested in it."
Uncertainty: The Results
The diverse roles the University's musi-
cal theatre students fill maximize their
chances of stepping onto the Broadway
stage - but graduation isn't the end of the
learning process.
Every May, the department's seniors
showcase their work for the University
community in Ann Arbor and for agents
and casting directors in New York City.
But there are no post-graduate guarantees,
even for graduates of such an esteemed pro-
gram.
Actors - even supremely educated
ones - still face major obstacles. Roles are
scarce, typecasting is rampant and there's
no guarantee of continuous work.
"You'll move to New York and meet peo-
ple who have incredible amounts of train-
ing at very prestigious schools, but when
it comes down to it, it's all about what the
casting directors are looking for," Ayesh
said.
"The school can't get you the job, but it
can teach you how to be confident in your
character's shoes so you're best prepared
for the caestin cal when t he time comes,"
he added.

'...the men and women merely players'
How the Department of Musical Theatre makes actors
By Timothy Rabb

Wednsda, Fbruay 212SB

You wake at the crack of dawn, sit up and clear your throat,
which feels oddly scratchy. Did you catch a cold, or just a
bit of phlegm? For your sake, you hope it's the latter. You
rifle frantically through your carry-on bag to find your elusive
accoutrements of CD, resumes and headshots. As you fall in line
with a crowd of jetlagged cohorts on your way into the lobby of
Chicago's Palmer House Hilton, you finally understand why your
favorite self-help forum referred to this proceeding as a "cattle
call."
Though such a scene is not unfamiliar to many a nervy Broad-
way hopeful, these particular auditionees are only in high school.
They're applying to college. Some of them don't even have driv-
ers' licenses.
The path toward the bright lights of Broadway is not an easy
one. The first step is earninga spot at the University's prestigious
Department of Musical Theatre.
Anxiety: The Audition
At the start of each year, hundreds of 16-, 17- and 18-year-old
musical theatre hopefuls congregate in Chicago, Las Vegas, Los
Angeles and New York City for the National Unified Auditions,
where they compete for select spots at some of the most presti-
gious performing arts schools in the nation. Though it marks only
the first milestone in many performers' careers, it's also one of
the biggest hurdles they'll have to clear on the dubious path to
Broadway glory.
"You get there and take a look around, and everyone just
looks so serious, and no one's saying anything," Music, Theatre
& Dance senior Carlye Tamaren said. "There's really no way to
prepare for that."
The tension intimates the possibility of an enormous payoff
Students compete under the watchful eyes of representatives
from the esteemed Cincinnati and Boston Conservatories, the
University of Oklahoma and the University of Michigan, among
others. The acting portion of the process calls for two contrast-
ing monologues with a 90-second time limit. For those who want
to showcase their vocal talent, an extra 30 seconds is added to
accommodate a song of the students' choosing.
After that, it's on to the "dance call," where students are
expected to prove that their choreographic chops transcend the
crude bumping and grinding of your average weekend warrior.
Some students audition as juniors in high school, others as
seniors.
Only three percent make the cut each year and get into the
University's program.
Current students, faculty and alum of the Department of Musi-
cal Theatre all concurred that for those who value a formal edu-
cation in the arts, the college auditions are even more intensive
than the real-world auditions for paid roles that follow college
graduation.
As MT&D alum Mark Ayesh puts it, "I'd rather audition for
50 Broadway shows than go back and re-do one college audi-
tion."
Ayesh graduated from the University in 2010 and subse-
quently landed the role of Roger Davis in "RENT," which ran

at the Westchester Broadway Theatre in Westchester, NY
from August through September of that year. When applying
to the University, he opted for an in-person audition because
of his positive impressions of department alums, far-reach-
ing enough to touch him in his hometown of Wichita, Kan.
"A lot of alums were working in my hometown during the
summer, and I actually wrote my entry paper on one of those
students," Ayesh said.
Ayesh's initial fondness for the program only raised the
stakes when the time came to try his luck at getting accepted.
"At an audition at a New York theater, your next job may
be based on the one minute you spend in that room," Ayesh
said. "But at a college audition, that one minute determines
the next four years of your life."
The Unified Auditions are often preferred by applicants
who want to save money, since they can kill around two dozen
birds with one stone, but those with the means to fly to audi-
tions at individual schools, like Ayesh did, often choose to do
so for a number of other reasons. on-site auditions not only
prevent a single debacle - like the flu or dancing missteps
- from ruining your admission chances at all your preferred
colleges, but also give prospective students an opportunity to
explore the campus they may eventually call home.
Perks aside, the on-site auditions are just as grueling as
the general ones. While some may see the process as arbi-
trary and more dependent on a certain "look" than anything
else, the "well-roundedness" Ayesh noted in the alums he
met wasn't a coincidence - the judging process is tailored to
immediately recognize the holistic potential of prospective
students, down to the finest details.
According to Brent Wagner, chair of the Department of
Musical Theatre, "When we listen to the song an applicant
chooses, we're looking for it to be pointed enough that we can
pick out the context and see that the words have a specific
meaning to them, and that the music enforces that meaning."
"We even pay attention to the times when the student
breathes during the song," he added. "It can indicate how
much they're actually thinking about what they're saying."
The whole ordeal is almost like a concentrated version of
the Greek life pledge process - withstand the backbreaking
rigors of the audition, and an atmosphere that seemed at first
cutthroat and cruel suddenly becomes a comfortable home.
"The moment you get accepted into this school, everyone
knows," MT&D junior Adrian Baidoo said. "Right after I got
in, I got a Facebook wall post saying 'Welcome to the family,'
and it couldn't have been more correct."
Method: T'he Role
Interview after interview with Musical Theatre majors
confirmed Baidoo's sentiments about the healthy camarade-
rie that follows a successful audition.
If the "teen movie" side of your brain is envisioning class-
wide catfights and fisticuffs over who ends up with the lead-
ing role in a department production, think again. The student
solidarity is a welcome "flip" (Ayesh's words) from the cutthroat
