On 
Monday 
evening, 
about 50 students attended a 
fireside chat hosted by Lean 
In at University of Michigan 
in the Ross School of Business. 
The event discussed women 
in 
politics, 
and 
panelists 
included 
local 
Michigan 
state representatives as well 
as politically active campus 
leaders. 
The event began with each 
panelist 
talking 
about 
her 
own 
background. 
Michigan 
state Rep. Rebekah Warren, 
D-Ann Arbor, discussed the 
inspiration 
she 
gets 
from 
politics. 
She 
talked 
about 
the power and impact the 
legislature 
has 
on 
people’s 

lives. Despite her background 
in 
chemical 
engineering, 
Warren said her role in politics 
started when she realized her 
passion 
for 
problem-solving 
and building coalitions.
Warren 
wasn’t 
the 
only 
panelist to begin her career 
outside of the field of politics. 
Michigan state Rep. Donna 
Lasinski, 
D-Ann 
Arbor, 
discussed 
her 
career 
in 
business after graduating from 
the Business School. 
Lasinski said her interest 
in 
politics 
came 
directly 
from her personal life and 
experiences as a mother. Her 
children attended a Title 1 
school, meaning the school 
receives 
additional 
funds 
due to large concentrations 

of 
low-income 
students 
in 
need of supplemental aid in 
order 
to 
meet 
educational 
goals. 
Lasinski 
said 
she 
recognized 
the 
challenges 
that come from learning in 
such an environment, where 
opportunities and resources 
were scarce. She began her 
professional (political) career 
in padvocating for low-income 
students on the school board, 
which ultimately led her to the 
legislature.
“If you see a problem in your 
community, complaining is not 
your job,” Lasinski said. “Your 
job is to step forward and offer 
a political solution.”
For others, it was their 
environment which inspired 
them. LSA junior, Kate Westa, 
 

who 
is 
the 
co-president 
of 
WeListen, 
a 
student 
organization on campus focused 
on 
fostering 
conversations 
between political parties, cited 
her experience growing up 
with a family member in the 
Air Force. Westa said she had 
an opportunity to meet with 
former President George H.W. 
Bush and explained it was a 
pivotal moment in her life.
“I remember it so clearly,” 
Westa said. “He seemed to 
genuinely 
care 
about 
the 
country and his dedication 
to being a public servant. 
Everything since then has been 
in the political realm.”

Monday evening, about 50 
students, faculty and community 
members attended a vigil on 
the Diag to show solidarity and 
honor the lives of those impacted 
by the bombing in Quetta, 

Pakistan on April 12.
The attack was on an open-air 
market and targeted the Hazara 
population, an ethnic minority 
that includes many followers of 
the Shia sect of Islam. At least 
20 people were killed and 40 
were wounded as a result of the 
bombing.

The ceremony was presented 
by 
the 
Pakistani 
Student 
Association, the Islamic Society 
of Ahl-ul-Bayt and the Muslim 
Students’ Association. Former 
ISA President and LSA junior 
Syed Rizvi was the emcee of 
the vigil. He opened with a 
description of the events that 

occurred in Quetta and the 
people who were impacted by 
the attack.
“These victims were simply 
regular people going about their 
lives,” Rizvi said. 

Gene Sperling, economist 
and 
policy 
adviser 
to 
Presidents Bill Clinton and 
Barack Obama, reflected on 
his professional career and 
discussed economic dignity in 
an event Monday coordinated 
by the Ford School of Public 
Policy and the Center on 
Finance, Law and Policy as 
part of its Policy Talks series. 
This series brings prominent 
leaders in varying policy fields 
to campus to discuss their 
opinions on specific issues. 
Sperling served as the director 
and national economic adviser 
of 
the 
National 
Economic 
Council. 
Public Policy Dean Michael 
Barr, a friend of Sperling, 
moderated the event as an 
informal 
discussion. 
Barr 
spoke 
about 
Sperling’s 
impressive 
professional 
repertoire and history.

In its final meeting of the 
semester, the University of 
Michigan 
Senate 
Assembly 
voted to table a resolution 
that would support the faculty 
open letter on climate change 
action. 
Marschall 
Runge, 
executive vice president for 
medical affairs, also spoke to 
the assembly about the Medical 
School and University health 
system.
If passed, the resolution 
would 
have 
expressed 
the 
assembly’s 
support 
for 
the 
faculty open letter on climate 
action and encourage members 
of the University community 
to 
sign 
it. 
However, 
the 
resolution was tabled during 
the meeting. The letter, written 
by 
Deborah 
Goldberg 
and 
Knute Nadelhoffer, professors 
of ecology and evolutionary 
biology, currently has 30 pages 
of signatures.

CAMPUS LIFE

City Council voted on two 
resolutions Monday night that 
will alter public transportation 
in Ann Arbor this summer. 
The 
first 
resolution 
addressed was the licensing 
of Spin, Inc. as the only 
serviceable electric scooter 
in Ann Arbor. The exclusive 
contract 
is 
effective 
immediately, 
eliminating 
electric scooter competition in 
Ann Arbor during the three-
month license period. Aside 
from Bird scooters, which 
appeared 
throughout 
the 
city in August, other electric 
scooter companies that would 
also be banned from the city 
include Lime and Lyft. 
The resolution to license 
only Spin comes amid the 
concern over other electric 
scooter companies’ inability 
to cooperate with the local 
government on restrictions 
and maintenance. When the 
Bird scooters were deployed in 
Ann Arbor at the start of the 
University’s academic year, 
the city responded later in 
September by seizing scooters 
left in the middle of sidewalks 
or city walkways. Neither 
the University of Michigan 
nor the city of Ann Arbor 
were aware of Bird’s plans to 
drop scooters in the city, and 
many community members 

expressed 
concerns 
over 
pedestrian safety, questioning 
whether people should be 
allowed to ride scooters on 
sidewalks. 
Councilmember 
Jeff 
Hayner, 
D-Ward 
1, 
was 
unclear what this resolution 
would 
do 
with 
the 
impounded 
Bird 
scooters 
still possessed by the city of 
Ann Arbor. Spin spokesman 
Frank 
Speek, 
government 
partnerships manager, said 
they are attempting to work in 
collaboration with Bird. 
“We’re working out those 
details with Bird right now, 
and the intent is to return 
them to the company,” Speek 
said. 
Spin 
said 
they 
do 
not 
surprise cities with loads of 
scooters — according their 
website, 
they 
collaborate 
with college campuses and 
city 
governments 
before 
launching.
“Our 
partnerships 
team 
works 
closely 
with 
the 
administration and student 
government,” 
the 
Spin 
website states. “Unlike some 
competitors, we never dump 
scooters without permission.”
Spin 
will 
deploy 
200 
scooters, comparable to the 
number of Birds that were 
initially placed in Ann Arbor 
in August.

A group of approximately 
50 students, faculty and 
community 
members 
gathered 
Monday 
night 
in the ballroom of the 
Michigan 
League 
for 
an 
open 
mic 
night, 
showcasing 
the 
stories 
and 
experiences 
of 
Asian/Pacific 
Islander 
Americans.
Multi-Ethnic 
Student 
Affairs hosted the open 
mic night as a part of the 
Asian/Pacific 
Islander 
American 
Heritage 

Month. The event, titled 
“hAPIness: 
Open 
Mic 
Night,” was co-hosted by 
Asian/Pacific 
Islander 
Desi 
of 
America 
Staff 
Association.
LSA 
sophomore 
Anooshka Gupta, a member 
of the programming board 
for the A/PIA Heritage 
Month, said one of the 
key reasons for hosting 
the event was to offer a 
single, inclusive platform 
to display diverse forms 
of art.
“One 
of 
our 
ideas 
behind 
open 
mic 
night 
was that, in the A/PIA 
community, 
there’s 
so 

much 
performance 
art 
and visual art and dance,” 
Gupta said. “...We were 
like, ‘Okay, we don’t want 
to have separate events for 

each, 
so how do we create a 
space 
where 
everyone 
can share their art?’ And 
that’s the key to open 
mic night.”
During 
the 
event, 
students 
performed 
various forms of fine art, 
ranging 
from 
spoken-
word poetry to musical 
performance, 
as 
a 
means of expression and 
cultural representation.
University alum Javier 
Solorzano 
Parada, 
a 
program 
manager 
for 
MESA, 
discussed 
the 
importance of events like 
this to help understand 
and 
communicate 
the 
identities of those in the 
A/PIA community.
“A/PIA 
Heritage 
Month has really been 
working 
towards 
the 
understanding that it’s 
not just about thinking 
about 
one 
specific 

identity,” 
Parada 
said. 
“It’s really about creating 
awareness of all of our 
different 
identities 
and 
how 
we 
are 
all 
each 

unique.”
LSA 
senior 
Maki 
O’Bryan, 
one 
of 
the 
emcees 
for 
the 
event, 
echoed 
the 
importance 
of 
finding 
individuality 
and 
personal 
meaning 
within communities and 
identities.
“I’ve 
been 
involved 
with the A/PI community 
on campus for the last 
four 
years, 
I’m 
pretty 
involved with the Japan 
Student Association and 
I just recently kind of got 
involved in the broader A/
PI community,” O’Bryan 
said. 
“I’m 
hoping 
this 
event will be a culmination 
of Heritage Month, but 
also my time at Michigan 
and my involvement with 
the community.”

On Sunday, the University of Michigan Museum of Natural History opened its doors to the public in its new location at the Biological 
Sciences Building. Museums have been a prominent feature at the University for close to 200 years.

1837: 
The University’s first nat-
ural history collection is 
created. Beginning as a 
Cabinet of 
Natural History, the cab-
inet was kept in the 
homes of 

1881: 
The first University museum 
building is established, 
housing four different 
museums: Museums of 
Paleontology, Zoology and 
Anthropological 
Archaeology and the 
University Herbarium. 

1956: 
The Exhibits Museum is 
officially established 
inside the Ruthven 
Museums Building.

2011: 
The Exhibits Museum

University of Michigan Museum 
of Natural History. The Provost 
also announces plans to build a 
new Biological Sciences
 Building that will also serve as 
the new home of UMMNH.

2017: 
The museum operates normally as 
scientists begin to take 
down exhibits.

According to Warren, her 
experience as the only female 
Democrat in the Michigan 
Senate for four years has 
made 
her 
realize 
female 
perspectives are essential. 
“We tend to fight amongst 
each other for one seat at the 
table, but we need to stop 
fighting for that one seat 
and 
start 
demanding 
the 
five spots at the table that 
we deserve,” Warren said. 
“Women’s voices at the table 
change conversations.”
Other 
panelists 
said 
it 
is often difficult to thrive 
in 
male-dominated 
fields. 
Warren said she was told 

repeatedly she was too young 
to run for office when her 
male rival was six months 
younger than her. Lasinski 
said she felt unable to wear 
a dress at her former job at 
DTE Energy because men 
would look up her skirt.
According 
to 
Lasinski, 
strong male allies can be 
beneficial but can also fall 
short of expectations.
“As I look across right now 
sometimes in the political 
world, you’ll see that the man 
has been a very strong ally 
for the woman until he feels 
that it is his turn,” Lasinski 
said. 
According 
to 
Lasinski, 
such microaggressions are 
harder to call out because 
they are more subtle and 

difficult to read directly. She 
said that’s why it’s necessary 

to 
have 
more 
women 
in 
positions of power.
Lasinski also said having 
women in positions of power 

in 
the 
government 
can 
change how bills are passed 
and 
addressed, 
especially 
bills which impact women.
“Having women in power 
is 
tremendous,” 
Lasinski 
said. “There are questions 
answered 
without 
being 
asked, 
issues 
brought 
up 
and recognized without it 
happening at the ninth hour.”
Warren 
agreed 
having 
everyone at the table would 
allow for broader and better 
legislation. She also pointed 
out the problem with labeling 
certain 
issues 
“women’s 
issues,” 
when 
oftentimes 
these issues are universal. 
She questioned what women’s 
issues 
exactly 
are 
and 
expressed her unwillingness 
to be pigeonholed.

“Every issue we deal with 
are all ‘women’s issues,’” 
Warren said. “I don’t ever 
want to be put into a box 
where I’m the only person 
who deals with this small 
subsection that you think are 
‘women’s issues.’” 
LSA 
sophomore 
Emily 
Baron said to The Daily after 
the event that she attended 
the fireside chat because she 
wanted to be exposed to a 
variety of ideas.
“I like to hear different 
people’s 
perspective,” 
Baron said. “I like to be an 
active listener; hearing the 
panelists is really inspiring 
even if it’s not something I’m 
directly interested in.”
LSA junior Sarah Stone, 
one of the organizers of 

the 
panel, 
explained 
the 
inspiration behind the event. 
Stone explained the event 
was 
supposed 
to 
address 
the broader conversation of 
female empowerment.
“As 
somebody 
who 
is 
not in the political field or 
track, 
learning 
the 
skills 
that women in high power 
fields experience and seeing 
how Rebekah (Warren) was 
a 
chemical 
engineer 
and 
completely changed her path 
to pursue her passion and 
take a stand and have become 
such an influential person; 
that’s 
something 
to 
take 
away,” Stone said.

POLITICS
From Page 1

“Gene 
is 
a 
leading 
voice 
in 
progressive politics in the United 
States today.” Barr said. “...He’s been 
a hero to me in Democratic politics 
and policymaking for a long time. 
Gene has this wonderful ability 
to pull together deep substantive 
knowledge in policy with a great 
political sense of how to get things 
done and an ability to communicate 
with the public and the media 
that 
enables 
policy 
to 
become 
accessible to the public. I think it is 
an extraordinary gift to have those 
three sets of skills in one human 
being.”
In discussing his professional 
career, Sperling acknowledged there 
is often not a singular, linear line to 
success. After serving under Clinton, 
Sperling 
became 
a 
writer 
and 

consultant for the television series 
“The West Wing.” Sperling discussed 
how the dramatic environmental 
change from Washington, D.C. to 
Hollywood changed his life for the 
better when he met the fellow “The 
West Wing” writers for the first 
time.
“I sit in the open spot, and I turn 
to my left and introduce myself to 
the first writer on my left, and that 
is how I met my wife,” Sperling said. 
“The moral of the story is that the 
real West Wing is the best thing in 
my professional life, and the fake 
West Wing is the best thing in my 
personal life.”
Sperling 
said 
he 
admired 
Obama and Clinton for running 
their administration in a way that 
encouraged open discussions. 
“I think that feeling of having 
everybody around a table and letting 
everybody speak up, encouraging an 
active debate, not making anyone feel 
that they will be punished or hurt 

by disagreeing with the president 
… I thought that was outstanding,” 
Sperling said.
Sperling said he is currently 
developing his next book, focused on 
how and why economic dignity is a 
necessity which must be prioritized. 
He defined economic dignity as a 
concept that encourages refocusing 
the main goal of economics to 
address human need and wellbeing 
over 
economic 
indicators. 
He 
recently wrote an essay on this topic 
for the Democracy Journal. 
Similarly to his essay, Sperling’s 
book will address the three pillars 
he has created to define economic 
dignity. The first pillar focuses on 
how every person should have the 
capacity to care for their family 
and have a good quality of life. This 
includes health care, paid family 
leave and a standard for bereavement 
leave.
“We need to think about the 
importance of life,” Sperling said. 

“Being there for your parents, being 
there for someone you love that has 
cancer, being able to spend time with 
your child. Those are maybe some of 
the greatest joys in life … And they 
are unbelievably economic.”
The second pillar of economic 
dignity addresses how the pursuit 
of potential and purpose should be 
achievable to every person. Sperling 
discussed how the United States 
is often seen as a place for second 
chances, but the way the economy 
is structured can prevent economic 
second chances.
“Are we a country that the accident 
of our birth determines the outcome 
of your life?” Sperling questioned. 
“This is a central assault on the 
dignity of so many people … This is 
not lack of value; this is often a lack 
of luck.”
The third pillar focuses on how 
every person should be able to 
participate in the economy while 
being respected and not facing 

discrimination 
and 
humiliation. 
Sperling 
expressed 
disgust 
for 
how people often suffer silently 
while they pursue their economic 
potential.
“If the price for you pursuing your 
potential was sexual harassment, it 
is a pretty big damn issue,” Sperling 
said.
Public 
Policy 
junior 
Pranav 
Govindaraju was excited to hear 
such a prominent figure discuss 
the concepts he has been studying. 
Govindaraju said he resonated with 
Sperling’s ideas on economic dignity 
and thought these ideas would be 
important to implement.
“When we talk about economics … 
we reduce things to an equation. We 
don’t really think about economics 
in terms of its actual social impact,” 
Govindaraju 
said. 
“Looking 
at 
economics through this lens of 
improving the human condition is an 
idea I definitely agree with.”

At last week’s Senate Advisory 
Committee 
on 
University 
Affairs meeting, the assembly 
voted to unanimously support 
the efforts of the faculty who 
wrote the letter and encourage 
other faculty to support the 
letter. 
The 
resolution 
from 
the assembly would have been 
considered separate from the 
SACUA resolution.
Assembly members debated 
the 
possible 
resolution, 
considering 
changing 
its 
language 
to 
support 
the 
intentions of the letter. Ron 
Larson, College of Engineering 
representative, expressed his 
concerns with the letter.
“I’m probably very much a 
minority on this, but I don’t 
support this letter,” Larson 
said. “I think the issue is very 
complicated. For example, the 

definition of carbon neutrality 
… To me, we have a committee 
that’s looking at this carefully, 
and 
carbon 
neutrality 
is 
something very hard to define.” 
The 
assembly 
further 
discussed 
the 
March 
15 
Washtenaw 
County 
Climate 
Strike, 
during 
which 
10 
demonstrators were arrested 
and given citations at the 
Fleming 
Administration 
Building for trespassing after a 
7.5 hour sit-in. Emily Campbell, 
school 
of 
information 
representative, said she thought 
the assembly should encourage 
the police department to not 
charge the demonstrators.
Joy Beatty, U-M Dearborn 
representative 
and 
Senate 
Assembly vice chair, said she 
met with University President 
Mark Schlissel during the sit-
in. She explained it did not 
sound like the demonstrators 
would be charged.
“Schlissel said he had had 

experiences at Berkeley where 
they didn’t make people leave,” 
Beatty said. “I guess he had 
learned from that experience 
that you have to get people out 
of the building.”
After 
discussing 
their 
thoughts on the letter and 
possibly 
amending 
the 
resolution, 
the 
assembly 
made the decision to table it, 
although they have no meetings 
remaining for the duration of 
the school year. 
In addition to tabling the 
resolution, 
the 
assembly 
listened to a presentation by 
Runge. In his presentation, 
Runge focused on the future 
of 
the 
University 
Medical 
School and health care. He 
said the main areas of focus 
for the Medical School include 
research, education and clinical 
care, as well as emphasizing the 
importance of learning through 
discovery science.
“Many important advances 

in medicine have come from 
discovery 
science,” 
Runge 
said. “They weren’t necessarily 
targeted science … Discovery 
science today is driven by 
really some top investigators 
in a wide variety of fields that 
someone who’s doing research 
as a graduate student, (if) they 
feel like their focus is on cancer, 
that research may also turn out 
to be important in neurological 
diseases or vascular diseases or 
other areas.”
Runge 
also 
discussed 
increasing the comfort, value 
of care and cost of care of 
University 
health 
systems, 
highlighting two new Brighton 
and Ann Arbor health care 
locations. He said the medical 
system is working to improve 
and become a better institution.
“We 
want 
to 
have 
an 
accountable culture, we want to 
have a positive culture,” Runge 
said. “We want to have a culture 
that advocates for patients, 

advocates for respect, advocates 
for anything that makes us 
more diverse, more inclusive 
and recognize that we all have 
well-being issues. A big issue 
in medicine is a phenomenon 
called burnout … and that has to 
do with relieving the stress that 
we all render and how we can 
most effectively prevent those.”
Following 
Runge’s 
presentation, 
assembly 
members asked Runge questions 
regarding 
his 
presentation. 
Campbell said she has been 
volunteering at the hospital 
for 11 years. She expressed 
support for the ability to ensure 
the well-being of doctors and 
questioned 
how 
to 
support 
them.
“I’m very impressed with the 
focus on the patient and family 
care … I’m just really impressed 
with that focus on making sure 
that our doctors are people, too,” 
Campbell said. “But what I’m 
worried about is making sure 

that we’re asking people to be 
incredibly expert at something 
and also be human. How do we 
support doctors in that way and 
make sure they’re getting the 
self-care they need?”
At the conclusion of the 
meeting, 
Neil 
Marsh 
made 
closing remarks as the outgoing 
Senate Assembly chair. 
“One 
of 
my 
personal 
motivations for taking on this 
responsibility of chair in the 
Senate has been that I get to 
interact with a whole bunch 
of smart, interesting people 
where if I had just stayed in 
my department in chemistry, 
I’d never ever meet and never 
ever know,” Marsh said. “I 
think that’s a valuable thing, 
and I think the opportunity to 
interact with your colleagues 
who you wouldn’t be otherwise 
is a valuable reason for being on 
Senate Assembly.”

“They 
were 
unarmed 
and 
peaceful and posed no threat to 
anyone. Yet they were killed. They 
were killed because as an ethnic 
minority, they looked different. 
They were killed because, as a 
religious minority, they prayed 
differently.”
There was then a moment of 
silence for the lives lost as a result of 
the Quetta attack.
The speakers at the event 
included 
ISA 
Social 
Co-chair 
Humza Hemani, LSA junior, who 
helped organize the event, as well 
as MSA Vice President of External 
Affairs Zoha Qureshi, a Public 
Policy senior. 
The third speaker, PSA Advocacy 
Chair Alezeh Mumtaz, an LSA 

freshman, spoke about the value of 
unity and compassion, especially 
during the times of these attacks.
“I’m not here to say a lot of big 
words, or spout about violence or 
this or that,” Mumtaz said. “I’m 
not here to share facts, I’m here to 
do what this vigil was created for: 
show and emphasize solidarity. 
All we need to know is that love 
and community are the things that 
matter, and the things that stand. 
So, we stand here today, in support 
of the innocent; we are gathered 
here, not on the basis of religion 
… but as believers of the power of 
good.”
In 
Qureshi’s 
speech, 
she 
spoke about how students at the 
University of Michigan should 
respond to these types of attacks 
— especially with the advantages 
students have.
“We should do all we can to 

support as college students at the 
University of Michigan with the 
privileges we hold and the power 
structures we live in,” Qureshi 
said. “Whether it be donating to 
a humanitarian cause, spreading 
awareness, standing in solidarity, 
spreading advocacy or simply 
offering a hand to a brother or sister 
who needs our support — we must 
come together.”
Qureshi 
further 
highlighted 
her experience at the vigil for 
New Zealand, and how the false 
active shooter threats made her 
reflect on those around the world 
who face these threats and attacks 
frequently impact.
“Just about a month ago, there 
was a vigil for New Zealand, and I 
remember being there and present 
and listening and mourning, but 
then moments later, running for my 
life in what I thought was an active 

shooter situation,” Qureshi said. “I 
am thankful that my peers and I 
are safe, but I remind myself that 
millions of people in this world do 
not have that luxury.”
Rizvi then opened the floor to 
those attending the vigil, offering 
them an opportunity to give 
speeches and express themselves 
at the ceremony. Several students 
and community members recited 
poetry in Urdu, the national 
language of Pakistan, and spoke 
about how they felt the attack 
impacted their lives and the lives of 
people they know.
Later in the event, Rizvi also 
highlighted the necessity for media 
coverage on the Quetta attack, 
and condemned the Pakistani 
government for failing to properly 
address the bombing.
“The lack of coverage of this 
event by the Pakistani mainstream 

media is absolutely unacceptable,” 
Rizvi said. “People are going to 
find out about this horrifying event 
one way or another, and when 
they do, they will not be happy. 
They will also not be happy when 
they find out that the government 
of Pakistan failed to address the 
issue, and offered neither adequate 
condolences, nor met with the 
people affected.”
After the event, Hemani spoke 
to The Daily about how he hoped 
those who attended the event 
gained more knowledge about 
the Hazara and recognized how 
their situation reflects of a larger 
problem of minority rights.
“I hope the attendees learned 
a little about the Hazara and their 
story,” Hemani said. “I hope they 
also saw this not just as an issue for 
Pakistan, but see it as part of a larger 
global issue of minority rights, and 

I tried to help push the focus of the 
event towards that minority rights 
in general.”
Over the past several days, 
about 200 Hazaras in Quetta and 
50 Hazaras in Karachi have been 
protesting and taking part in sit-ins 
as a result of the attack. Hemani 
believes the Hazaras are doing 
what they can to fight for the rights, 
but the power their community 
has alone is not enough to make an 
effective difference.
“I think the sit-in protests are 
effectively the only tool the Hazara 
have left to them,” Hemani said. 
“There is power in seeing an entire 
community come together to say 
something is wrong, but it hasn’t 
brought real change yet, and that’s 
why we need non-Hazaras to also 
speak out for them, because at the 
end of the day, the Hazaras don’t 
have a lot of political influence.”

Additionally, Spin will pay the 
city of Ann Arbor $5,000 for this 
license and $1 per day per scooter, 
for a total of $18,400. This is 
based on having 200 scooters 
operating in the city for three 
months. After the three-month 
period, the city must adopt an 
ordinance to extend or terminate 
the license.

While many students used 
Bird scooter charging positions 
as a form of revenue, Spin also has 
applications to become chargers. 
An Ann Arbor position has not 
been placed on their website as of 
April 15. 
The resolution to enter into 
the 
three-month 
contract 
with Spin passed unanimously 
among councilmembers with no 
discussion. 
The second transportation-
related 
resolution 
confirmed 
funds for the first two-way 

protected bike lane in Michigan 
to start construction in May. The 
protected bike lane, which will 
include barriers to protect bikers 
from passing cars, is a $1,329,964 
project to be built on William 
Street stretching from Fourth 
Street to State Street. 
The resolution is the first 
of its kind in the state. City 
Administrator 
Howard 
Lazarus says the investment is 
worthwhile because the Ann 
Arbor Downtown Development 
Authority — the authority that 

will construct this project — will 
split construction costs with 
the city. The DDA will cover 65 
percent of concrete resurfacing 
payment. 
In addition to the construction 
cost reduction, Lazarus says the 
progress it brings for the city is 
also important to consider.
“This does benefit the city 
as well,” Lazarus said. “I think 
there’s a tremendous amount of 
prestige, as we are one of the most 
forward-looking cities in many 
areas in Michigan. This would 

be the first two-way protected 
cycle traffic lane in the state of 
Michigan.” 
This resolution was raised 
as City Council acknowledged 
many residents bike around the 
city. There have also been alleged 
concerns from the University that 
too many bikes cut through the 
Diag, causing walking-pedestrian 
concern. The enhanced road 
safety for bicyclists provided 
by the protected lane is also an 
attempt to divert the bike traffic 
from the Diag.

Councilmember Julie Grand, 
D-Ward 3, said she bikes around 
Ann Arbor herself and does 
not feel safe with the current 
provisions for bikers on streets. 
“I work in Angell Hall and 
there are times where I’ll walk 
and leave my bike there because 
I don’t feel as comfortable biking 
from campus to City Hall,” 
Grand said. “Everyone does ride 
their bikes. I think this is a great 
example of a city-University 
partnership and making our city 
safer.”

T

he 2020 Democratic 
primary 
has 
been 
defined by a number 
of litmus tests. Many of the 
candidates in the progressive 
wing of the party, including 
Sen. 
Cory 
Booker, 
Sen. 
Kamala Harris, former U.S. 
Rep. 
Beto 
O’Rourke 
and 
others have been pushed to 
prove their progressive merits 
by stating their support for 
key progressive policies or 
process 
measures. 
Which 
policies 
constitute 
those 
litmus 
tests 
is 
important 
because they offer a signal 
about which issues Democrats 
will prioritize if they retake 
power in 2020. As of this 
writing, they are in support 
for some form of “Medicare 
for all” and the Green New 
Deal 
— 
the 
“superstar” 
policies. Different candidates 
are trying to add what they see 
as their unique contribution 
to that list. Booker introduced 
a baby bonds bill and Harris 
wants to expand the earned 
income tax credit through her 
LIFT the Middle Class Act. 
These candidates are trying 
to elevate the specific policy 
area they have expertise in to 
the level of “Medicare for all” 
and the Green New Deal. The 
policy most deserving of being 
promoted to superstar status 
is Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s 
proposal for universal child 
care and affordable preschool. 
Warren’s plan guarantees 
that every American making 
less 
than 
approximately 
twice the poverty line will 
be able to send their child 
to 
government-sponsored 
day care and preschool for 
free. Families making more 
than that amount would pay 
for the service on a sliding 
scale tied to income, maxing 
out at 7 percent for the 
wealthiest. Warren’s proposal 
is 
important 
and 
timely 
because child care costs are 
high and rising — the median 
annual price is $8,320, more 
than half the cost of in-state 
tuition at the University of 
Michigan — and takes up 
between, according to some 
estimates, 9 and 36 percent 
of annual household income. 
Warren’s plan would also 
establish quality standards 
that all programs receiving 
government support would 
have to meet to address the 

poor state of preschools in 
the United States right now. 
To meet that plan, Warren 
proposes paying daycare and 
preschool instructors more 
like the teachers they are. 
The 
proposal 
is 
also 
important 
because 
the 
United States lags behind 
other countries in child care 
and 
preschool 
attendance. 
According to a 2015 report, 
the United States ranks 31st 
in 
3-year-old 
enrollment 
among the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and 
Development, a group of 36 
mostly rich countries. The 
United States needs real and 
dramatic 
early 
childhood 
education reform. 
Democratic 
candidates 
are supportive of expansions 
of early childhood education, 
but besides Warren, none 
has supported making child 
care universal. All the other 
senators running for president 
have signed onto a long-
running bill to double the 
number of children eligible 
for subsidized child care, but 
stop short of universality. 
Every Democratic 2020 
candidate should pledge to 
fight for Warren’s plan or 
some expansion of child care 
and preschool if elected, but 
they have not felt the need to. 
Voters and the media have not 
considered 
universal 
child 
care a priority for progressive 
candidates for president, but 
they should. 
One 
reason 
Warren’s 
policy 
has 
not 
achieved 
superstar status is because the 
research seems to show that 
early 
childhood 
education 
is not actually helpful for 
students. However, this line 
of research takes too narrow 
an 
approach. 
Early 
child 
education 
proponents 
cite 
that 
academic 
differences 
between 
children 
who 
participated 
in 
programs 
and 
those 
who 
did 
not 
are negligible as early as 
first grade. But this line of 
research 
is 
fundamentally 
flawed because it does not 
fully consider the long-term 
impacts of these programs 
on 
families 
or 
students. 
Studies that look at how 
access to reliable day care 
impacts students long-term 
have 
consistently 
shown 
favorable tangible impacts — 

higher college attendance and 
graduation, lower drug use 
and arrest rates — as well as 
positive impacts on maturity.
The research shows that 
the 
benefits 
of 
universal 
preschool, while negligible in 
the classroom, are significant 
in other areas of children’s 
lives, at least in the short-
term. They allow parents to 
avoid child-care costs, such 
as hiring a babysitter, paying 
for expensive day care or the 
opportunity cost of a parent 
staying at home to take care 
of the child. With subsidized 
or free child care, traditional 
family 
income 
is 
more 
resilient because there will be 
more sources, creating a more 
stable home environment. 
But 
the 
benefits 
of 
child 
care 
extend 
beyond 
the 
children 
themselves. 
Universal 
child 
care 
and 
affordable preschool would 
serve to improve the gender 
pay gap. When children are 
not in school, women are 
far more likely to stay at 
home than men. Taking a 
break from work sets women 
back in the workplace and 
contributes to the gender pay 
gap. 
Both Booker’s baby bonds 
bill and Harris’ LIFT Act are 
trying to promote equity, 
but universal child care is a 
more comprehensive effort to 
promote equal opportunity. 
Progressives should support 
universal child care, and not 
just an expansion as most 
do, for moral and political 
reasons. 
Morally, 
every 
child should have access to 
early childcare’s long-term 
benefits and parents should 
not have to sabotage their 
careers due to expensive child 
care. Politically, pushing for 
ambitious solutions may make 
incremental progress more 
likely, as it has for health 
care 
coverage 
expansions. 
The litmus test dynamic of 
the Democratic primary is 
complicated and problematic, 
but voters and the media 
should brand the candidates 
that 
have 
not 
decisively 
supported 
universal 
child 
care as less progressive than 
those who have.

Reflections atop a dead mountain
R

ecently, I took a road 
trip down to 
West Virginia 
to 
learn 
more 
about 
mountaintop 
removal coal mining 
and tour the remains 
of a retired mine on 
Kayford 
Mountain, 
located in a rural 
area 
outside 
of 
Charleston, 
W.V. 
Mountaintop 
removal, as the name 
suggests, is a process of coal 
mining that involves rigging 
explosives to a mountaintop 
and blowing it up so coal 
companies can extract threads 
of coal hidden in the interior of 
the mountain. The results are 
devastating to the local ecology 
and topography, reducing the 
richly 
biodiverse 
area 
and 
leveling the mountain to a 
barren rocky landscape. My 
commitment to environmental 
activism guided my journey 
to see the horrible effects of 
coal mining firsthand, yet, my 
experience was not exactly 
what I had pictured it would be.
In fact, while the lifeless 
remains of the mountain itself 
were enough to depress anyone, 
it was the interaction with the 
local community that moved 
me more. The environmental 
implications of mountaintop 
removal coal mining, and coal 
mining in general, are well 
documented, however, the more 
insidious effect is the economic 
burden placed on the people 
living in these communities. 
West Virginia is a state that is 
somewhat dependent on coal for 
its economy. Coal built the state 
and its ongoing slow demise has 
devastated rural communities. 
The trip highlighted just how 
influential coal is to the people 
of West Virginia. Growing up in 
Michigan, I felt strong parallels 
between the coal mines of West 
Virginia and the auto factories 
of Flint and Detroit. In both 
cases local communities are 
wholly dependent on a singular 
employer and eventually are 
left with no viable safety net.
While on Kayford Mountain, 
my group encountered a local 
who lived on the mountain 
and coincidentally had a close 
personal 
tie 
to 
Michigan. 
After 
exchanging 
a 
few 
pleasantries, he told us in his 
thick Appalachian accent that 
he lived and worked in Flint for 
the better part of 25 years. He 
said that when he was young, 
the coal mine in his town shut 
down, so he packed up and 
headed north to work in the 
auto industry. He worked at 
a factory in Flint doing metal 
work until General Motors shut 
down some of its operations. He 
moved back to West Virginia 
and has been living on the 
mountain ever since.
The 
connection 
between 
Appalachia and the Midwest 
runs deeper than I could have 
thought. Larry Gibson, founder 
of the nonprofit Keeper of the 
Mountains, 
responsible 
for 
giving tours of mountaintop 
removal on Kayford Mountain, 
actually spent most of his life in 
northern Ohio. When GM shut 
down its plant in the 1980s, 
Gibson decided to move back 
to West Virginia and live in an 
area that his family had owned 
for 
a 
generation. 
Gibson’s 
culture and heritage are rooted 
deeply in a mix of Midwestern 

and 
Appalachian 
values 
of 
hard, honest work. 
While on the tour, 
Bill 
DePaulo, 
an 
environmental 
lawyer and member 
of Keeper of the 
Mountains, 
told 
stories 
about 
what 
inspired 
Gibson to start the 
nonprofit. 
Back 
before mountaintop 
removal coal mining 
started, Kayford was the lowest 
point in the surrounding peaks 
of the Appalachian Mountains; 
however, 
coal 
companies 
stripped down the surrounding 
summits and the once beautiful 
and rich landscape became flat 
and dead. When coal companies 
tried to buy Gibson’s land, 
his 
charitable 
organization 
instead managed to designate 
his property as a public park 
via a land trust agreement, 
thus protecting it from further 
mountaintop 
removal 
and 
allowing public tours.
As one might expect, this 
angered the coal companies 
operating in the area, and 
they did everything in their 
power to scare Gibson away. 
According to DePaulo, when 
Keeper of the Mountains first 
started operating on Kayford 
Mountain, 
coal 
companies 
would send people to intimidate 
tourists and environmentalists 
by shooting into the air or 
emptying a revolver clip into 
vacant trailers. While on the 
tour, I walked past a trailer that 
still had bullet holes scattered 
throughout 
the 
exterior. 
Sometimes 
the 
intimidation 
turned 
to 
actual 
violence. 
DePaulo told a story of how one 
morning, Gibson had woken up 
to find his dog had been killed 
and strung up on his front 
porch. While there was no note, 
the timing and circumstances 
heavily suggests that someone 
from the coal companies was 
responsible.
While 
absolutely 
tragic, 
Gibson’s story is not an isolated 
incident. Coal and fossil fuel 
industries have a proven history 
of intimidation and violence, 
and have played an active role 
in spreading misinformation 
about their practices. In the 
1920s, coal companies created 
an army to fight a movement 
of miners wanting to unionize, 
resulting in what historians 
have coined the coal wars. 
Their 
size 
and 
checkbooks 
give them absolute power over 
their workers, residents and 
politicians. When talking with 
DePaulo 
about 
the 
politics 
of the region, he stated aptly 
that “there is no Republican 
or Democratic Party in West 
Virginia — just the coal party.”
A pillar of President Donald 
Trump’s 
2016 
presidential 
campaign 
was 
saving 
coal. 
As things stand today, he has 
completely failed to do so. The 
coal industry likes to propagate 
the idea that renewables and 
environmental standards are 
responsible for the closure 
of mines, but this is a gross 
oversimplification 
of 
the 
problem. Natural gas is about 
60 percent more efficient than 
the oldest coal plants in terms of 
electricity generation, and is far 
more cost effective, making it 
coal’s biggest remaining threat. 
As for the rapid loss of jobs in 
the region, coal companies 

themselves are also to blame. 
While miners’ employment has 
been rapidly decreasing, overall 
coal production has remained 
relatively constant primarily 
due to mechanization. It is 
evident that the coal industry 
and lobbyists want to frame 
environmentalists as the enemy 
of miners to cover up their own 
influence in their misfortune. 
The fact of the matter remains: 
Coal is a dying industry.
Driving 
through 
the 
mountains 
and 
seeing 
the 
burdens firsthand reminded me 
that our rhetoric surrounding 
the 
transition 
away 
from 
coal should change as well. 
The negative effects of coal 
on human health, from both 
mining 
and 
burning, 
in 
addition to the environmental 
implications, are well-proven. 
If we are to seriously make 
any progress in limiting the 
effects of climate change, the 
transition away from coal and 
fossil fuels must be swift. Often 
we talk about environmental 
justice for the communities 
that are most affected but have 
the least power or capacity 
to do anything about it. This 
needs to apply to the forgotten 
coal miners of Appalachia as 
well. Can we blame unemployed 
miners for wanting to keep 
their jobs, put food on the 
table or send their kids to 
school? They too are victims 
and deserve justice in the fight 
against fossil fuel. The blame 
for their circumstances falls 
on the politicians, Republican 
and Democratic alike, who 
allow fossil fuel money to 
influence their decisions and 
who contribute to incendiary 
misinformation campaigns.
Organizations, 
nonprofits 
and 
startups 
have 
opened 
in 
the 
region, 
dedicated 
to training coal miners in 
new, more applicable skills 
for a modern economy. The 
renewables sector has already 
been outpacing coal in total 
jobs as well as job growth, 
providing 
an 
opportunity 
to 
train 
unemployed 
coal 
miners in wind turbine and 
solar production, as well as 
installation. West Virginians 
have a deep-rooted cultural 
connection to energy — many 
talk proudly about Appalachia’s 
history 
of 
powering 
the 
nation just as Midwesterners 
talk 
about 
the 
automotive 
industry — and this provides 
an opportunity for them to hold 
onto that culture while helping 
the environment instead of 
harming it.
While programs like these 
are beneficial, there is still 
much work to be done in order 
to help struggling communities. 
Most important among these is 
the need to keep big fossil fuel 
money out of the politicians’ 
pockets, at the local, state and 
national level, who actively 
work against the transition 
to renewables. Promising the 
coal industry will come back 
is deceitful and damaging, and 
only prolongs the inevitable. 
As long as politicians continue 
to accept lobbying money and 
influence from the fossil fuel 
industry, they are only going to 
continue to hurt the very people 
they are elected to represent.

I

t 
was 
with 
great 
disappointment that we 
read University President 
Mark 
Schlissel’s 
interview 
with The Michigan Daily, 
published on March 11 under 
the headline “Schlissel: ‘We 
are very much a confederation 
of 
three 
campuses.’” 
In 
his 
comments, 
Schlissel 
defended 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
failure 
to 
sustainably 
and 
equitably 
fund our Dearborn and Flint 
campuses. Unfortunately, he 
did not address the concerns 
of many students, faculty, 
non-instructional staff and 
community members whose 
very livelihoods are at stake.
It’s impossible to overstate 
the severity of the funding 
gap between the Ann Arbor, 
Flint and Dearborn campuses. 
Despite the fact that Dearborn 
and Flint students pay about 80 
percent of the tuition that Ann 
Arbor students pay, their per-
student funding is drastically 
lower than that — 23 percent 
and 25 percent, according to 
our research. This means that 
their students receive about 
one quarter of the resources 
that Ann Arbor provides to 
its students for instructional 
support, financial aid, health 
services and more. Rates of 
student debt are similarly 
staggering.
As a percentage of average 
family income, Flint students 
take on almost 3 times as 
much debt as Ann Arbor 
students, 
and 
Dearborn 
students take on twice as 
much. The Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion initiative and 
Go 
Blue 
Guarantee 
that 
this 
University 
rightfully 
champions exist only on the 
Ann Arbor campus.

These 
disparities 
persist 
while the University sits on 
a massive surplus of funds. 
Every year since 2007, the 
University, according to data 
we’ve compiled, has had a 
surplus of more than $182 
million – which is more than 
the entire General Funds of 
Flint or Dearborn.

Schlissel has the power 
and funding to rectify these 
disparities. However, in his 
interview, 
he 
stated 
that 
addressing these inequities is 
impossible due to worries over 
campus autonomy and the 
different characters of each 
campus. We appreciate his 
considerations for preserving 
the unique missions of the 
Dearborn and Flint campuses. 
But 
without 
increased 
funding, 
those 
missions 
cannot be met effectively. We 
see no contradiction between 
respecting 
the 
autonomy 
of the three campuses and 
equitably funding each.
We, the One University 
Coalition 
comprised 
of 
members 
from 
the 
Flint, 
Dearborn 
and 
Ann 
Arbor 
campus 
communities, 
are 
offering to sit down with 
Schlissel to discuss our needs, 
the platform we have proposed 
to address them and how we 
might achieve them while 

respecting the autonomy of 
each campus. Striving for 
equity in Dearborn and Flint 
will increase opportunities 
for 
Michigan’s 
residents 
and 
allow 
the 
University 
of Michigan to emerge as a 
national leader in enhancing 
diversity, 
equity 
and 
inclusion initiatives in higher 
education. By reallocating a 
relatively small portion of the 
Ann Arbor campus budget — 
or simply using a small part of 
the University’s multi-billion-
dollar endowment — Schlissel 
and the Board of Regents have 
the opportunity to drastically 
transform the lives of students 
and faculty on the Dearborn 
and Flint campuses. Instead, 
the University is choosing 
to 
forgo 
that 
opportunity 
and silo the budgets of these 
campuses entirely.
The University of Michigan 
cannot 
truly 
create 
an 
environment 
of 
diversity, 
equity and inclusion if it 
fails to support the Flint and 
Dearborn campuses it calls 
home. 
Like 
Schlissel, 
we 
believe that this university is 
home to the Leaders and the 
Best — and Leaders and the 
Best can do better than this.

A stage name is special. Oftentimes, it’s a unique 
representation of a creative identity that an artist feels 
his or her given name does not properly personify.

In the short span of three years, 
Sally Rooney has evolved from 
essayist to fiction writer to “the 
first great millennial novelist.” 
Rooney got a New Yorker interview 
in January, told The Guardian that 
she “do(esn’t) respond to authority 
very well” and has a 10-minute 
YouTube video on writing and 
Marxism. She’s a veritable cultural 
event, heralded for her bare prose, 
biting irony and slow burn of love 
in the time of late capitalism. Just 
check out what happens when 
you search #normalpeople on 
Instagram.
“Normal People” drops in the 
States on Tuesday, Apr. 16, and 
The Michigan Daily Book Review 
is 
celebrating 
by 
reviewing 
Rooney’s fiction career, last to 
first. Catch “Normal People” on 
the 16th, “Conversations with 
Friends” on the 17th and “Mr 
Salary” on the 18th.
When 
I 
first 
reopened 
“Normal People” this past week 
to brainstorm this review, I was 
struck with a potent nostalgia. 
It had been three months since 
I’d first read Sally Rooney’s 
second novel, and still, there it 
was: a form of wistfulness about 
the journey of reading the book 
through for the first time. There 
was some jealousy of my past 
self and the first, traumatic slog 
through the book, too, mixed also 
with a bit of love for the characters 
in the story. This familiar nostalgia 
didn’t come from any one place and 
is maybe too difficult to interpret, 
but I think it speaks volumes to 
the real, raw power of “Normal 
People.”
“Normal People” is Rooney’s 
follow up to the equally popular 
“Conversations 
with 
Friends,” 
and her elegance continues to 
defy standards. Rooney’s novel is a 
story about contemporary love and 
companionship to its gut, though 
not love in the sense of archaic 
Austen or young and modern John 
Green. Rooney sculpts her own 
breed of intimate story, one maybe 

best paralleled with Kundera’s 
“The Unbearable Lightness of 
Being.” Like Kundera, “Normal 
People,” to its core is about just this 
— normal people.
Longlisted for the 2018 Man 
Booker Prize, Rooney’s book alters 
between the firsthand narratives 
of 
Connell 
and 
Marianne, 
beginning with their final year 
in high school and ending with 
their last in college. At the start 
of the book, the two begin the 
groundwork of a relationship just 
before graduating — Marianne 
the outcast of their high school 
and Connell the popular, smart 
guy among their peers. The two 
keep things secret until Connell 
neglects to ask Marianne to 
the dance, at which point she 

disconsolately severs contact. It 
sounds terribly stereotypical, and 
maybe even more stereotypical to 
say, “this version is different,” but 
it really is. Even from its inception, 
the story is carefully written. 
It is not penned to target a teen 
audience or rework an intimate 
love story. It is merely about two 
absolutely mundane characters 
that Rooney knows with a sacred 
intimacy and to whom she is 
allowing us access.
As Connell and Marianne enter 
college and their paths cross again 
and again, Rooney starts to bring to 
fruition one of the most accurate, 
gentle stories about the transition 
from adolescence to adulthood. 
Rooney writes brilliantly of topics 
emotive and familiar, studying the 
normal of awkward introductory 

sex and the strange, young space 
of relationships while parents 
are always nearby. As the story 
progresses, she asks readers to 
stare down abuse, alienation and 
perhaps most powerfully the 
universal sensation of the phasing 
out of one age of life and the slow 
entrance of another. Rooney’s 
storytelling is unique because it 
refuses the use of any avoidable 
images and verbosity — the text 
of “Normal People” is raw, left 
only with its familiar dialogue 
and straightforward chronical of 
action.
As the story progresses, both 
Connell and Marianne become 
nearly unrecognizable forms of 
the characters readers were first 
introduced to. As their relationship 
twists and develops over time, 
so do they — Marianne in her 
oscillating levels of popularity, 
her emotional coping and her 
perceptions of others; Connell 
in his contentment and desires 
towards 
women 
and 
his 
academic career. This graduation 
of change is portrayed subtly. 
Rather than revealing long 
passages of character thought 
or detail, Rooney sticks to basics 
and simply moves through the 
story. The characters become 
deeply identifiable to readers, not 
because of one explicit similarity 
to life, but rather from the lack 
thereof — Rooney’s writing pares 
the writing to its very bones, 
making character development 
moldable to more experiences. 
“Normal People” quickly becomes 
less about momentary details, and 
more about patterns over time.
When all is finished, “Normal 
People” speaks in the gentle 
voices of its characters but is 
overwhelming with its realistic 
extremity. Rooney offers one of 
the best depictions of 21st century 
love yet — its fleetingness, its 
complexity and its publicity. It 
is a devastating and hopeless 
and 
thrilling 
depiction. 
It’s 
unsurprising that foundations are 
scooping the novel up for shortlists 
and awards. Rooney has made 
normal people something to go 
crazy for.

Rooney depicts current 
love correctly, with poise

OutKast is one of many 
pioneers that made the South 
the hip-hop powerhouse it is 
today, but that didn’t come 
without fighting for it.
Their name origin story is 
nothing too special. André 
3000 and Big Boi wanted to 
call 
themselves 
“2 
Shades 
Deep,” but learned it was 
taken. They then chose “The 
Misfits,” but that was taken 
too. As the story goes, they 
found “outcast” as a synonym 
for “misfit” in a dictionary and 
kept the “k” from the phonetic 
spelling. The duo settled for 
their third choice.
Flash back to the infamous 
1995 Source Awards. At this 
point in hip-hop history, the 
East-Coast-West-Coast rivalry 
was in full swing, and the 
two sides were on the verge of 
exploding. So when OutKast 
— a Southern group — was 
awarded Best New Rap Group, 
the crowd roared with boos. 
“OutKast” was a third choice 
name for the duo, and OutKast 
was a third choice candidate 
for Best New Rap Group to the 
audience.
In 
that 
moment, 
André 
3000 and Big Boi literally were 
outcasts. The two rappers from 

Atlanta were left out of the 
debate when all the audience 
wanted to see was a winner 
from N.Y. or Calif. to fuel the 
beef. Then André took the mic, 
and said what might be hip 
hop’s most famous words: “The 
South got somethin’ to say.”
In the words of fellow 
Atlanta 
superstar 
Ludacris: 
“Pressure 
can 
either 
bust 
pipes or create a diamond, and 
what André said when he got 
on that microphone created a 
diamond.”
OutKast’s classic sophomore 
album released in 1996 would 
be fittingly titled ATLiens. At 
the time, they were outcasts, 
rap-game aliens from Atlanta. 
When the album went double 
platinum, OutKast became a 
household name. By the time 
Speakerboxxx/The Love Below 
went diamond, Andre 3000 
and BigBoi were outcasts no 
longer. The South had spoken.

The word “woozy” sounds 
like a reference to insobriety, 
but for Sven Gamsky, the 
genius behind Still Woozy, it 
has a different connotation. 
His trance-inducing, groovy 
sound isn’t an ode to moments 
of indulgence, but rather his 
tendency to feel one step 
behind and out of the flow of 
life. 
Sven Gamsky extends the 

definition of woozy and makes 
it completely his own, taking 
the groovy connotations of 
the word and layering it with 
feeling odd and out of place. 
Gamsky’s music videos, live 
performances, interviews and 
social media presence makes 
it blaringly obvious that he is 
simply weird and fun, dancing 
awkwardly 
and 
dropping 
unconventional music videos 
that embody the confused core 
behind the name Still Woozy.
This “out of the mainstream 
flow of life” definition of 
woozy matches his approach 
to music in every way: In 
an 
interview 
with 
WECB, 
Gamsky explains how he is 
not the kind of person that 
thrives in business oriented 
environments. He makes music 
in 
his 
garage-slash-studio, 
independent 
from 
a 
label, 
working with a close team who 
helps with the heavy lifting. 
He is extremely self-aware, 
and his pseudonym becomes 
even sweeter considering his 
entire approach is focused on a 
mesmerizing sound that elicits 
oddball movement. 
Gamsky’s 
fake 
name 
characterizes the days when 
life takes on its own rhythm, 
and you’re just on the outside 
looking in — pair that “one step 
behind” persona with a funky, 
synth-based beat, and you have 
yourself Still Woozy.

SMTD 
senior 
Colter 
Schoenfish 
presented 
Alexi 
Kaye Campbell’s debut play “The 
Pride” in the Newman Studio for 
his senior thesis this past Friday. 
Alternating between 1958 and 
2008, “The Pride” focuses on 
the changing attitudes toward 
sexuality over the course of five 
decades and the courage it takes 
to become who you truly are. 
The play follows the lives of the 
same three characters, 50 years 
apart, and their relationships 
with one another and their own 
sexuality. The characters battle 
with hiding behind a figurative 
veil so as to not expose their true 
selves.
The scenic design by SMTD 
sophomore 
Grace 
Linzner 
represented this “veil of lies,” 
quite literally. The play was done 
in thrust with the audience on 
three sides of the playing area, 
a smart choice for Schoenfish. 
This allowed the actors to be in 
closer proximity to the audience, 
heightening 
the 
character’s 
vulnerability (or lack thereof). 
Sheer see-through curtains were 
hung up along every side of the 
playing area, closing it off to the 
audience. Through the course 
of the show an actor would 
rip down one of the curtains. 
As the veil was literally shed, 
it was taken off symbolically 
as well. As each actor ripped 
down a curtain, a truth about a 
character was revealed. By the 
end of the show, all the curtains 
were gone. The characters could 
no longer hide behind the veil 
from the judgement of others, 
either literally or figuratively. 

Only 
their 
most 
vulnerable 
wants and desires were left 
onstage for all to witness. This 
was an original and clever idea 
that was executed beautifully.
Unlike this scenic design, 
Campbell’s 
writing 
lacked 
originality. 
Although 
the 
theme to live your truth is an 
important one, it is also one that 
has been overdone in literature, 
especially in regards to LGBTQ 
relationships. However, while I 
would have liked to see LGBTQ 
relationships explored in a more 
unique way, the play is quite 
genuine.
Yet, Campbell seemed so 
impassioned by his ideas that his 
writing was sometimes preachy. 
There was little faith given to 
the audience, and it seemed that 
the author was worried viewers 
would not recognize the central 
theme of the play. He felt the 
need to utilize monologues to 
repeat similar ideas over and 
over again. While the text was 
full of intricate language and 
imagery, it often felt repetitive 
and unnecessary. 
Although the British dialects 
faltered, the overall delivery of 
the text by the cast of four was 
astonishing. The performances 
by 
SMTD 
freshman 
Chris 
Jensen (The Man) and SMTD 
senior 
Alexandra 
Reynolds 
(Sylvia) 
were 
particularly 
impressive.
Jensen 
played 
numerous 
characters 
throughout 
the 
production. 
Most 
of 
them 
provided comedic relief during 
times of great tension. Jensen 
was grounded in his delivery and 
provided a refreshing change of 
pace to the overall tone of the 
play. He was also the strongest 

among the ensemble of actors in 
dialects.
Reynolds’ attention to detail 
and commitment to her work 
made 
repetitive 
dialogue 
exciting and intelligent. An 
inexperienced actor would have 
drowned in the river of emotions 
that Sylvia faces throughout the 
play. Yet, Reynolds took this 
demanding character on with 
great confidence and poise. Her 
natural knack for correct pacing 
and delivery was dynamite.
Another noteworthy member 
of 
“The 
Pride” 
team 
was 
director, 
Colter 
Schoenfish. 
Schoenfish had great choices in 
terms of stillness and movement. 
Never splitting focus, important 
information was always relayed 
clearly to the audience. The 
movements 
of 
the 
actors 
seemed organic while still being 
dynamic. The orchestration of 
the transitions were smooth and 
time effective. Schoenfish had a 
fantastic understanding of the 
play itself and a unique vision for 
the production.
SMTD and Stamps junior 
David Forsee’s use of projection 
was as aesthetically pleasing as it 
was effective in providing a new 
color to a play that could have 
easily been simply designed.
Being a queer woman, it is 
always exciting to see queer 
people represented in artistic 
spaces. I felt that the stories of 
the characters on stage were 
told with grace, empathy and 
compassion. The struggle to 
be true to yourself is universal, 
but it is especially pertinent in 
LGBTQ communities.

‘The Pride’ showcases the 
beauty in genuine selfhood

FOR RENT

Adapted from the memoir 
“I’m Special: And Other Lies 
We Tell Ourselves” by Ryan 
O’Connell, “Special” tells his 
semi-autobiographical tale of 
life as a gay man with cerebral 
palsy who is learning how to 
live on his own. “Special,” 
produced 
by 
Jim 
Parsons 
(“The 
Big 
Bang 
Theory”), 
distinguishes 
itself 
from 
other shows about disabled 
people right off the bat, 
avoiding common tropes of 
self-pity and the erasure of 
romantic plotlines. It also 
is one of the few shows 
featuring a disabled actor 
actually playing a disabled 
character.
Like all new TV shows, 
it takes a few episodes for the 
show to find its stride. The 
dialogue 
is 
initially 
heavy 
with unintentional awkward 
silence in conversations and a 
forced effort to be funny, but 
gradually, the dialogue begins 
to sound more realistic and 
confident in its delivery. It’s 
easy to binge, but it’s a shame 
that the show ends right when 
it begins to self-actualize.
There are several memorable 
scenes 
that 
don’t 
resemble 
anything that’s ever been seen 
on television. One of the most 
daring scenes is when Olivia 

(Marla Mindelle, “Kevin Hart’s 
Guide 
to 
Black 
History”), 
Ryan’s boss, sets him up with 
her cousin after hearing that 
he was looking for a boyfriend. 
Ryan agrees but is surprised 
when he realizes that his 
date is deaf. He says he can 
“do better than a deaf guy,” 
and Olivia immediately calls 
him out for his internalized 
ableism — the idea that societal 
prejudices against the disabled 
cause disabled people to loathe 

themselves and others who fall 
under the same category. On 
TV, the most common narrative 
arc for disabled people is their 
constant internal conflict and 
attempt to fit into society. 
While Ryan experiences this 
as well, the show delves deeper 
into the complexities of how 
being disabled doesn’t give 
you a free pass to treat other 
humans as lesser.
It 
also 
tackles 
disability 
from a mother’s perspective. In 
media about disability, mothers 
are often portrayed as strong, 
impenetrable forces that live 

solely to support their kids. 
Although some moms embody 
this 
personality, 
“Special” 
recognizes the struggles many 
parents face with empty nest 
syndrome. Ryan’s mom, Karen 
(Jessica 
Hecht, 
“Quantico”), 
dutifully represents a mother 
who has spent her whole life 
acting as an on-call nurse 
for both her son and her own 
mother, who has dementia. 
When Ryan leaves the house, 
she wrestles with trying to 
start up her own life again 
whilst constantly worrying 
about her son’s well-being. 
Parents will be able to 
resonate with her narrative, 
which the show thankfully 
never neglects throughout 
the season.
Despite the show’s rough 
start, “Special” flourishes 
nicely into a unique and 
rarely-seen representation of 
the disabled and how their 
struggles aren’t so different 
from able-bodied people. As 
aforementioned, 
“Special” 
ended right at what seemed like 
the climax of the show, giving 
Netflix even more incentive 
for renewal if the impressively 
fresh 
plot 
wasn’t 
enough. 
Seeing as true stories like these 
hardly 
ever 
gain 
attention 
on 
mainstream 
television, 
there are so many layers and 
dimensions of disability the 
show can bring to the surface 
on a platform like Netflix.

Netflix’s ‘Special’ breaks

Season 1

I tried to like this movie. I 
really, really did. I told myself 
that 
to 
expect 
perfection 
from a romantic comedy is 
absolutely 
unrealistic. 
And 
even though I’ve been less than 
impressed with Netflix’s past 
ventures into the genre, “To 
All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” 
included, at least they had a 
point, something they wanted 
to say. Unfortunately, “The 
Perfect Date” has anything but 
a point. Underdeveloped and 
uninspired in every possible 
sense, “The Perfect Date” has 
nothing to say. Because of this, 
it is truly, truly terrible and 
completely devoid of anything 
resembling life.
The 
movie 
follows 
our 
protagonist Brooks Rattigan 
(you read that right, Brooks 
Rattigan), 
played 
by 
Noah 
Centineo (“To All the Boys I’ve 
Loved Before”). Brooks wants 
two things in life — one, to 
attend Yale, and two, to change 
the world. By some logic I still 
don’t fully understand, Brooks 
decides that developing an 
app with his best friend that 
connects him to local high 
school girls who are interested 
in renting his dating services 
for money — which, by the way, 
could only come across as some 
kind of male power fantasy — is 
his ticket into Yale.
His first client and eventual 
love interest is Celia, played 
by Laura Marano (“Austin and 
Ally”), who I must say is one of 
the more deplorable romantic 
comedy 
leads 
in 
recent 

memory. Celia prides herself on 
being “not like the other girls.” 
She even says at one point, 
“Just because I’m a little weird 
doesn’t make me less human. In 
fact, it makes me more human.” 
Somehow, the movie thinks 
that Celia’s “quirks,” such as 
being an awkward dancer and 
disliking high heels, equate to 
her having a personality. Not 
surprisingly, they don’t. Celia 
is boring, dull and empty of 
any substance, just like Brooks, 
precisely because she is made 
into a stereotype rather than 
an interesting, fully-formed 
human being.

As you may have guessed 
at this point, “The Perfect 
Date” 
is 
awful 
primarily 
because of its writing. Not 
only is the script desperately 
dependent on tired stereotypes 
and 
cliches, 
including 
the 
conveniently 
helpful 
gay 
best friend and the arbitrary 
makeover scene that once again 
reduces the character’s worth 
to their outward appearance, it 
chooses to incorporate several 
unnecessary plot points that 
are 
never 
elaborated 
upon 
fully. For instance, Brooks’s 

mother left his family when he 
was young to start another one 
with someone else. While this 
has the potential to be truly 
intriguing and to give insight 
into why Brooks is the way he 
is, it hardly seems to affect him 
at all. In fact, it’s mentioned 
once or twice and then never 
discussed again. While I could 
suggest that the filmmakers 
extend the movie’s somewhat 
short runtime of just under an 
hour and half to better develop 
Brooks’s backstory, I have to 
admit that I’m glad the movie 
ended sooner rather than later 
for my own sanity. Neither lead 
delivers a particularly stellar 
performance, but it’s hard to 
blame them considering the 
dialogue 
they 
were 
given, 
much of which is outright 
hysterical: “I’m a gay teenage 
pimp wearing a secondhand 
hoodie … my life as I envisioned 
it.”
All in all, “The Perfect 
Date” is a charmless, instantly 
forgettable addition to the 
romantic 
comedy 
canon. 
Watching the movie, I couldn’t 
help but think back to another, 
far superior Netflix movie 
starring Noah Centineo — “To 
All the Boys I’ve Loved Before.” 
While that movie isn’t perfect, 
it has substance. It has a soul. 
On the contrary, “The Perfect 
Date” is lifeless, with a script so 
bad it’s almost condescending. 
We know Netflix can do better; 
“To All the Boys” proves that. 
We must show Netflix that 
we deserve better. To do this, 
I highly recommend you skip 
“The Perfect Date,” both for 
your own sake and for the 
future of the romantic comedy.

Vinitaly, Verona: The largest 
wine exhibition in the world, a 
vino lover’s heaven, a logistical 
nightmare, an Italian cultural 
celebration that is so grandiose 
it is nearly impossible carry out. 
Vinitaly is a festival spanning 
four days filled with wine, 
food, art and music in support 
of the Italian wine community. 
The fiasco is set in one of Italy’s 
hidden gems, the city of lovers 
and Juliet’s crumbling ancient 
home base: Verona, Italy. This 
is perhaps less of a festival 
and more of a production. The 
curtain goes up on day one, 
bright and early as wine lovers 
pour 
into 
the 
fairgrounds, 
longing to make connections 
over young, punchy whites and 
deep, thoughtful reds. For the 
next 96 hours, the curtain does 
not close. It is probably the only 
event in the world that brings 
together such a high volume 
of 
wine 
makers, 
vineyard 
owners, 
wine 
buyers 
and 
importers, restaurateurs and 
wine lovers in an amalgamation 
of wine tasting, negotiations 
and innovation surrounding 
viniculture and the Italian 
wine industry.
This is a place I could 
disappear into.
I 
had 
the 
pleasure 
of 
accompanying my father, a 

restauranteur, 
to 
the 
54th 
Vinitaly festival this past week. 
Verona, a place I had not been 
since I was eight years old, has 
aged hardly a day — her walls 
and roads still boast strong 
cobblestone and aged brick, 
romantic as ever. Her nightlife 
is hot, energetic, fashionable 
and lively — pulsing brightly 
into the early hours of the 
morning. I remembered two 
things of Verona from my 
previous visit: The pigeons 
and the people — both large in 
number, the latter bashful and 
subdued in the face of such 
an outpour of attention from 
tourists.
The first morning begins 
with an uncertain, intangible 
energy. The hotel we’re staying 
in is filled with other festival 
goers, and the whole city is 
teeming — the air, bright and 
crisp in the early days of Spring, 
is awaiting something too. On 
a taxi ride to the fairgrounds 
from the hotel, we are told in 
half-Italian, half-English that 
we have to share the taxi we’ve 
ordered with another party, as 
the taxis are in high demand —
everyone in Verona today has 
a common destination. In the 
cab, we have our first strangely 
ironic, authentic connection 
of the day when we realize, 
through no common language, 
that we know our fellow cab 
members through their famous 

Italian vineyard. As we pull up 
to the fairgrounds, we swap 
business cards and promise to 
come visit their booth at the 
fair — a promise, I learned, that 
is not easily kept once swept 
up in the camaraderie and 
commotion of the event. 
Entering the fair is like trying 
to fit a beast into a dog’s cage. 
Thousands of people, elbows 
extended, surging toward three 
doors which open into a huge 
clearing that is home to the ten 
warehouses. Along with the 
warehouses is a display made 
of cork and flowers which 
reads, “Vinitaly 54.” Welcome, 
wine lovers — Verona has been 
waiting. It’s 9 a.m. and the scene 
inside the fair is utter chaos. 
In Italian, lovers and friends 
quarrel over which province 
to visit first. Important men 
in expensive suits carrying 
leather 
briefcases 
beeline 
toward their first meetings of 
the day. Everyone is smoking 
cigarettes, everyone is dressed 
their best, almost everyone is 
prepared to pace themselves 
through a dreamy cycle of wine 
tastings. Navigating by foldable 
map and iPhone app, we begin 
our journey through the world 
of Italian wine, one wine glass 
at a time.

Sophomore attacker Caitlin 
Muir, positioned behind the 
goal, received a pass from 
sophomore midfielder Maggie 
Kane off the opening draw. She 
wrapped around and took a 
shot that found the back of the 
net, giving the No. 8 Michigan 
women’s lacrosse team (14-1 
overall, 4-1 Big Ten) the lead 
over Rutgers (5-9, 0-4) just 17 
seconds into the game en route 
to a 12-8 win on Saturday.
Coming 
off 
their first loss 
of the season to 
No. 2 Maryland, 
the 
Wolverine 
players 
aimed 
to take an early 
lead in order to 
regain some of 
the 
confidence 
from 
their 
13-game winning 
streak that was 
snapped against the Terrapins 
last week.
“I feel like it really boosted 
our morale because coming off 
Maryland we wanted to get 
up early and get going,” Muir 
said. “I think it really pushed 
everyone to go harder and 
faster and kept the trend up.”
Michigan 
took 
advantage 
of this momentum and used 
it to take a four-goal first-
half lead. Three more goals 
scored by Muir, along with 
two from junior midfielder 
Nadine 
Stewart 
and 
one 
each from junior midfielder 
Molly Garrett and freshman 
midfielder 
Kaitlyn 
Mead 
gave the Wolverines an 8-4 
advantage at halftime.
Michigan began the second 
half just as strong as it ended 
the first, with Kane scoring 
just 1:39 into the half. But the 
scoring quickly dried up as the 
Wolverines didn’t score again 
for more than 20 minutes, 

with 
Rutgers 
goalkeeper 
Kameron Halsall making five 
saves in that span. With 10:26 
remaining in the game, the 
Scarlet Knights had cut the 
Michigan lead to two.
“We were getting shots, 
but I think once a few of them 
didn’t go in, the girls played a 
little on their heels and just 
started freezing up a little bit,” 
said Michigan coach Hannah 
Nielsen. “We were making 
stop after stop defensively, 
but we were hitting pipes, 
hitting the goalie, and she had 
a great game. 
I thought we 
were 
getting 
the shots but 
it wasn’t quite 
falling 
our 
way.”
Even though 
Rutgers 
appeared 
to 
be 
gaining 
momentum 
midway 
through the second half — 
scoring three consecutive goals 
— the Wolverines kept fighting. 
They put together a strong 
offensive 
possession 
that 
resulted in Halsall saving a 
free position shot, and followed 
it up with a defensive stand.
After 
clearing 
the 
zone, 
Muir 
took 
possession 
and 
drew a foul. She then scored 
her fifth goal of the day on the 
resulting free position shot, 
giving Michigan a 10-7 lead 
with 7:37 left. Garrett and 
sophomore 
midfielder 
Erin 
Daly both scored in the next 
four minutes, securing the 
victory for the Wolverines.
“We just needed that to keep 
the momentum going,” Muir 
said. “We knew we were OK, 
but we just wanted to keep it 
going. We were missing a lot of 
shots, so that really got people’s 
confidence back up.”
Added Nielsen: “I thought 
we were getting better looks 

on cage. We weren’t taking the 
low angle shots and we were 
sharing the ball around.”
Since the Wolverines had 
not lost all season prior to 
last weekend, this was their 
first opportunity to prove that 
they could bounce back from a 
tough loss. While Rutgers is not 
a particularly strong opponent, 
Michigan’s strong start and 
continued persistence offered 
encouraging signs for this team 
going forward.
“We had a lot of fun this 
week in practice. We worked 
really 
hard,” 
Nielsen 
said. 
“We worked on some concepts 
that we put forth in the game 
today, and I thought the girls 
responded really well.”
As the regular season winds 
down, Michigan is approaching 
the most important part of its 
season. Playing aggressively 
from 
the 
opening 
whistle 
and 
persevering 
when 
the 
offense isn’t converting during 
stretches of the game like on 
Saturday will be crucial in 
hopes of beating the best teams 
in the country.

Facing their team and coaches 
with their families by their sides, 
the 11 seniors of the Michigan 
women’s lacrosse team stood 
pregame, in uniform, on their 
home turf, for the final time. 
As the PA announced each 
player’s position, name and 
hometown, the Wolverines were 
recognized for a historic season 
that is far from over, and how 
the 11 women holding bouquets 
of maize flowers helped shape 
the program into what it is today. 
And help shape the program, 
they did.
The eighth-ranked Wolverines 
put on a show for the crowd, 
defeating Rutgers, 12-8. This 
win helped secure Michigan’s 
first undefeated home season 
since the program’s inception in 
2014.
Though they didn’t play a 
perfect game by any means, the 
Wolverines defeated the Scarlet 
Knights for the first time ever 
in the U-M Lacrosse Stadium, 
propelled by sophomore Caitlin 

Muir’s team-best five goals. 
Junior Lilly Grass broke the 
single-season record for assists 
behind her five on Saturday, and 
senior Mira Shane recorded her 
100th save on the season and 
ended the game with 106. 
Shane was challenged with 
a much more offensive-minded 
opponent on Saturday, forcing 
her to be much more alert and 
energized in the net at all times. 
“I think it’s a mentality thing,” 
Shane said. “I think I stay busy in 
my mind, even though I may not 
be running around. I always try 
to stay connected 
with our offense. 
You 
might 
see 
me 
doing 
some sprints as 
(the 
offensive 
players) 
score. 
But that’s only 
for me – I kind 
of get energized 
by them scoring 
and us having 
these 
great 
opportunities. I think that’s how 
we stay in the zone as a defensive 
unit.”

Rutgers took 16 shots on goal 
in Saturday’s game, something 
Shane isn’t unfamiliar with. 
Facing so many shots forces her 
to stay alert, providing an energy 
that transfers to the rest of the 
team.
“I think it just forces me and 
energizes me to pick up the level 
of my game,” Shane said. “If I’m 
seeing more shots, I definitely 
always want to come out with 
a win, and, you know, give my 
team the best performance that I 
can. ... just having a great Senior 
Day was really important to me, 
for this being 
our last regular 
season 
home 
game.”
As 
Shane, 
the 
starting 
goalkeeper 
for 
the 
2018-2019 
season, reflected 
on her four years 
in 
the 
maize 
and 
blue, 
she 
couldn’t 
help 
but get emotional. With all of 
the changes Michigan women’s 
lacrosse has gone through, from 
being a sub-.500 performance 
in Shane’s freshman year to 
nationally-ranked 
program, 
she has been a key factor in 
Michigan’s 
record-breaking 
seasons. 
“I think it was my goal today 
to play with gratitude and heart,” 
Shane said. “It’s been a heck 
of a ride for four years, playing 
a lot of different games with 
a lot of different people. And 
today to just play at home with 
my parents by my side during 
this 
Senior 
Day 
celebration 
with wonderful teammates and 
coaches that I’ve had all season.
“I don’t think it gets much 
better than that. And so I was 
just really thankful to have a 
great win today, and then to 
keep it going for the rest of our 
season. As you said – it’s not 
over, we’re not done, and this 
team is definitely going places.”

Foster charges past competition

As sophomore Chloe Foster 
approached the final stretch of 
the track and leaped over her 
final hurdle at Cardinal Park 
in Louisville, Ky., there was 
nothing but daylight behind 
her.
By the moment the second-
place 
competitor 
crossed 
the finish line, nearly three 
seconds had passed. Foster 
cruised to a runaway victory 
in the 400-meter hurdles with 
a career-best outing of 58.60 
seconds to cap off a successful 
day for the No. 21 Michigan 
women’s track and field team 
at the Louisville Invitational. 
It wasn’t just Foster who 
succeeded for the Wolverines. 
As a team, they won three 
events and placed in the top 
five in 11 total events on the 
day.
“(Foster) is a very hard 
worker,” said Michigan coach 
James Henry. “We have high 
expectation of her. We have 
a lot of confidence in her and 
it’s a matter of getting her 
confidence up.”
Foster’s 
performance 
not 
only shattered her previous 
personal 
record 
by 
nearly 
three-quarters of a second, but 

also moved her up to fifth all-
time in school history for the 
400-meter hurdles.
“It’s just the beginning of 
how good we think she can 
be as an athlete,” Henry said. 
“She’s a great student and I 
think she could be just as good 
as an athlete.”
Elsewhere on the track, 
the Wolverines posted strong 
showings from the middle-
distance group. Junior Micaela 
DeGenero 
impressed in the 
800-meter run 
with a 2:07.69 
performance, 
more 
than 
a 
second 
faster 
than 
anyone 
else in the field.
Fresh 
off 
their 
own 
wins, 
Foster 
and 
DeGenero 
joined a team of sophomores, 
Alice Hill and Jenna Reid, to 
clinch the 4x400-meter relay 
(3:43.22), 
Michigan’s 
third 
and final victory of the meet. 
Junior Julia Hall and senior 
Meg Darmofal also impressed, 
by placing third in the 400 
meters 
and 
3,000 
meters 
respectively.
“I think we had a number of 
performances to be proud of 

as a team,” Henry said. “Our 
athletes stepped up and had 
better competitions and better 
performances we were happy 
with.”
Senior Jeryne Fish set the 
tone for the Wolverines on the 
field with a personal record of 
5.08 meters in the long jump. 
Her showing was particularly 
encouraging, as it came after 
her return from surgery that 
sidelined her for all of last 
season.
Junior 
Katt 
Miner 
continued 
Michigan’s 
stellar play on 
the 
field 
by 
posting a fifth-
place finish in 
the high jump 
after a season-
best 1.70 meter 
performance.
Health 
remains 
the 
key 
question for the Wolverines, 
as they head into the Big Ten 
Championships and the rest of 
postseason play.
“We have to stay healthy and 
we’re always as good as we are 
healthy,” Henry said. “We’re 
just starting to get the health 
under 
our 
athletic 
ability 
and that’s where we need to 
improve.”

‘M’ gets mixed results in Columbus

Settle in two ... one ... two ...
Settle. 
On junior coxswain Erik 
Yasuda’s call, the 2V8 made a 
dramatic shift. At the settle, 
the rowers elongated their 
stroke in unison from the quick, 
choppy catches of the starting 
sequence to a more sustainable 
racing pace against Ohio State. 
By the end of the day Saturday 
— facing the Buckeyes and 
Rutgers at the Big Ten Double 
Dual — the No. 5 Michigan 
rowing team had finished first 
in 11 of the 14 total races.
Through 
the 
starting 
sequence and the following 
high strokes, the Wolverines 
battled Ohio State to get out in 
front with neither team able to 
take a commanding lead. 
With 
this 
settle 
stroke, 
the boat found its rhythm. 
Michigan jumped up two seats 
at the 500-meter mark and 
never let up, something senior 
Shayla Lamb credits to the 
boat’s single-minded focus.
“It had to do with our base 
pace,” 
Lamb 
said. 
“That’s 
something we’ve been working 
on: getting into our rhythm and 
staying internal. I think that’s 

something we’ll keep working 
on to get better.”
Michigan increased its lead 
by inches with every stroke, 
taking a decisive lead by the 
time the boat crossed the 
1,250-meter 
mark. 
Taking 
control of the race gave the 
Wolverines the confidence and 
control they needed to keep 
walking away into the second 
1,000 meters. 
As the last 500 meters 
came up, 2V8 got ready to 
take another move to seal the 
victory. 
“We worked on sprinting 
quite a lot — well, no not quite 
a lot — but we’ve worked on 
making those moves at the 
end,” 
Lamb 
said. 
“That’s 
something we (have) gotten 
more experience with in the 
past couple of weeks. It’s nice to 
have that in our back pocket.”
While they knew they had 
this skill at their disposal, they 
didn’t have to rely on it. Despite 
Ohio 
State’s 
best 
efforts, 
Michigan only increased its 
lead in the sprint, finishing the 
race half a boat length up on its 
competition. 
The 2V8 boat went on to beat 
Rutgers by over 10 seconds, 
though other boats experienced 
mixed results. 

The 1V8 was edged out 
by the Buckeyes, but found 
redemption against the Scarlet 
Knights 
later 
in 
the 
day. 
Despite the loss — its first of 
the season — Michigan coach 
Mark Rothstein was content 
with the race. 
“Our boat raced really hard 
and showed a lot of toughness,” 
Rothstein said. 
That boat — led by freshman 
Jessica Schoonbee in stroke 
seat — fell short by a mere .96 
seconds and finished in 6:22.04 
minutes. 
Other freshmen prevailed in 
the 1N8 which beat out both of 
its opponents. 
The first two fours also 
found success against Rutgers. 
The 1V4 lost to Ohio State while 
the 2V4 beat them by eight 
seconds. 
Despite the overall success 
of the weekend, Michigan has 
some room for improvement — 
especially as the 1V8 will have a 
chance to redeem itself against 
Ohio State next weekend at 
Lake Las Vegas. 
Lamb hinted she may know 
the key to success. 
“We need to keep finding our 
rhythm early on and making 
that middle one (kilometer) 
ours.”

When it comes to versatility, 
Natalia Rodriguez is in a class of 
her own.
Now in her second season as the 
Michigan softball team’s starting 
shortstop, the sophomore can do 
it all. She’s a switch-hitter at the 
plate, speed demon on the base 
paths and defensive stalwart in the 
field.
But 
above 
all, 
Rodriguez 
provides 
consistency. 
She 
appeared in 55 of last season’s 59 
contests and has started all 39 of 
the Wolverines’ games so far this 
year.
Rodriguez’s defensive prowess 
played a major role in 2018’s 
seamless 
shortstop 
transition. 
After Michigan bid farewell to 
Abby Ramirez — a two-time All-
Big Ten shortstop who graduated 
in 2017 — Rodriguez held her own 
on defense as a freshman. Her .944 
fielding percentage was only a 
slight drop-off from Ramirez’s .953 
clip in 2017.
At the plate, Rodriguez has 
taken a massive leap forward. After 
posting a .250 batting average last 
season — the worst among the 
Wolverines’ starters — Rodriguez 
spent much of the offseason in the 
batting cage. Now, as one of the 

country’s only true switch-hitters, 
she poses a threat regardless of the 
situation. Her ability to bunt from 
both sides of the plate, slap-hit 
from the left side and swing away 
from the right side makes her the 
Big Ten’s jack of all trades.
Through 87 at-bats this season, 
the 
results 
have 
spoken 
for 
themselves. With the home stretch 
of Michigan’s conference slate on 
the horizon, Rodriguez’s batting 
average is sitting at .310.
Naturally, Rodriguez’s batting 
average boost has given her more 
opportunity to wreak havoc on the 
base paths. After swiping 10 bases 
on 12 tries last season, Rodriguez 
has successfully stolen seven bags 
on eight attempts so far this season. 
Her speed gives opposing pitchers 
one more thing to worry about, 
which opens up opportunities for 
other Wolverines to find success at 
the plate.
“(Rodriguez stealing a base) 
manufactures 
a 
run,” 
said 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins. 
“You’ve got to find a way to 
manufacture runs, and one of 
those is to steal their bases. It puts 
us in position, and it is a difference 
maker.”
The synergy of Rodriguez’s 
improvement at the plate and elite 
speed puts Hutchins in a dilemma. 
With the team’s leadoff through 

cleanup hitters all batting above 
.340 with at least 20 RBI, it doesn’t 
make sense to insert Rodriguez’s 
skillset into the heart of the order. 
So instead, she bats last.
The only qualm about hitting 
ninth is the fact that it takes the bat 
out of Rodriguez’s hands at times. 
Heading into the second half 
of April, Rodriguez already has 
upwards of 30 fewer at-bats than 
some of her teammates.
But 
for 
Hutchins, 
strategy 
outweighs total plate appearances.
“It’s really important to have 
that nine hitter be your secondary 
leadoff,” Hutchins said. “It puts 
base runners on — someone 
with great speed — for the top of 
your order. (Rodriguez) has been 
outstanding in that category, and 
we need her to keep it up.”
Added junior right fielder Haley 
Hoogenraad: “(Rodriguez) is a 
huge turnover for the start of the 
lineup. She’s basically like another 
number one hitter. She bats at 
the top of the order but turns the 
order over a lot by getting on base 
a lot somehow. That’s so important 
in the bottom of the order, just 
finding a way to get bases. Bases 
are how you win games.”
With Rodriguez holding down 
the fort in the ninth spot, the 
Wolverines set the top of their 
order up for success.

Alexander, Hoogenraad snap slumps

Katie Alexander and Haley 
Hoogenraad are no strangers to 
going the extra mile.
With their struggles mounting 
during the No. 21 Michigan 
softball team’s first month of 
Big Ten competition, the senior 
catcher and junior right fielder 
have spent even more time in the 
batting cage before practice.
Going into the weekend series 
against Ohio State, the two 
returning starters were able to use 
the Wolverines’ overall success 
at the plate to mask their own 
shortcomings.
Michigan 
swept 
Nebraska, 
Rutgers and Indiana en route to a 
9-0 record to begin Big Ten play. 
During this start, the Wolverines 
posted a batting average of .315 
and plated more than seven runs 
per game. But Hoogenraad and 
Alexander — the seventh and 
eighth batters in Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins’ lineup — didn’t 
partake in the hit parade. The 
duo posted an average of just .220, 
while the first four hitters in the 
lineup combined for a .396 clip.
But in Columbus, Hoogenraad 
and Alexander flipped the switch.
With the scoreboard knotted 
up at one run apiece in the fourth 
inning of Friday’s series-opener, 
Hoogenraad stepped up to the 
plate while Alexander took warm-
up cuts in the on-deck circle. 
Junior outfielder Thais Gonzalez, 
who entered the game as a pinch 
runner, represented the go-ahead 
run at first base.
Four pitches into the at-bat, 
Hoogenraad put a swing on the 
fifth. She drove the ball down the 
right field line, and it tailed away 
from the diving Buckeye outfielder 
just enough to ricochet off her 
glove. As Hoogenraad pulled into 
third base with a triple, she took 
a moment to reflect on her first 
extra-base hit of the month.
“The best feeling is when you 
get to third base and look back 
into the dugout, and everyone 
in the dugout is really excited,” 

Hoogenraad said. “That is the 
best feeling, knowing you did it for 
everyone else.”
When Alexander made her way 
to the plate, she didn’t give the 
dugout much time to rest before 
the crack of her bat sent another 
wave of jubilation its way. Just 
two pitches after Hoogenraad’s 
triple, 
Alexander 
launched 
a 
no-doubt home run to deep right-
center field. This time, the entire 
Michigan dugout emptied as it 
celebrated the end of its captain’s 
coldspell.
Alexander’s 
next 
at-bat 
provided an equally exciting 
sequel. After working the count 
full, she fouled off a pair of payoff 
pitches before getting ahold of 
the third. When Alexander made 
contact on the sweet spot, she 
began her home run trot for the 
second time in as many plate 
appearances. The long ball gave 
the Wolverines a 6-3 advantage in 
the sixth frame.
An inning later, Hoogenraad 
made her way to the batter’s box 
with the bases loaded and two 
outs. She seized her chance to 
break the game open, belting a 
grand slam over the left-center 
field wall to give Michigan a 10-3 
lead.
“We really needed the (number) 
six through nine hitters to pick up 
their production, and they did an 
outstanding job,” Hutchins said. 
“… (Hoogenraad and Alexander) 
connected on pitches. That’s what 
we’re striving for, and it doesn’t 
happen every time.”
In the first game of Saturday’s 
doubleheader, the tandem led yet 
another comeback win.

After 
seeing 
Ohio 
State 
take 
freshman 
right-hander 
Alex Storako deep twice in the 
first inning, Hoogenraad and 
Alexander helped the Wolverines 
claw back in the second frame. 
Hoogenraad’s opposite-field RBI 
single cut the Buckeyes’ lead in 
half, and she made her way into 
scoring position with a stolen base 
just moments later.
In the ensuing at-bat, Alexander 
laced an RBI single through the 
left side to tie the game. When 
Hoogenraad scored on a sacrifice 
bunt later in the inning, Michigan 
took the lead for good. Alexander’s 
crucial hit clinched the series win 
and brought her batting average to 
.214 — its highest mark since Feb. 
22.
“No matter how (Alexander’s) 
season is going, she’s always in 
there working hard and going the 
extra mile to try to make herself 
better,” Hoogenraad said. “That 
just goes to show perseverance, 
even when things aren’t going 
your way, you’re always in there 
putting in more work and doing 
extra to try to make yourself better 
and that really is a true showing of 
perseverance.”
When 
the 
dust 
settled, 
Hoogenraad 
and 
Alexander 
tallied eight hits across 16 at-bats, 
10 RBI and five runs scored in the 
series.
If Hoogenraad and Alexander 
can permanently break their 
slumps, that extra mile in the 
batting cage could add coveted 
length to the lineup — a key 
ingredient in the Wolverines’ 
pursuit of their 11th Big Ten 
championship in 12 years.

Pitching, defense lead to series loss

Friday night’s game hung in 
the balance. Buckeye catcher 
Dillon Dingler stepped to the 
plate with his team leading 2-1.
Dingler attempted a bunt that 
went straight back at junior left-
hander Tommy Henry. The ball 
slipped out of Henry’s hand, 
and his throw went wayward, 
allowing Dingler to advance all 
the way to second base.
After 
that 
inauspicious 
start to the fifth inning, Henry 
imploded. He proceeded to give 
up three runs on a sacrifice fly 
and three singles, as Ohio State 
eventually pulled away to a 
10-5 victory over the Michigan 
baseball team on its way to two 
wins out of three games.
“When you play good defense 
you minimize the opponent’s 
opportunities,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “If you make 
that difficult play, that’s what 
I’m talking about. Being able to 
make the difficult play to take 
away the hits.
“Those difficult plays end up 
being a difference-maker in a 
team scoring zero or maybe only 
scoring one or two versus not 
making those plays and what 
could’ve been a one or two run 
inning turns into a three or a 
four or five or a six-run inning.”

Henry didn’t just struggle on 
defense — he had difficulties 
on the mound, too. He gave up 
eight hits and seven earned 
runs in just four innings while 
striking out two. Henry didn’t 
get much help from his relief 
pitchers, either. Freshman left-
hander Walker Cleveland and 
sophomore right-hander Blake 
Beers combined to give up three 
additional runs in 2.2 innings of 
work.
“Pitching can 
go 
into 
little 
slumps, too, now 
just like hitters 
can,” 
Bakich 
said. 
“Tommy 
Henry has just 
had a little bit 
of a two-week 
slump here. We 
haven’t won on 
a Friday night 
in conference in a few weeks. 
He maybe hasn’t been quite as 
crisp or as sharp as he has been 
in the past. But, we all have full 
confidence in the pitcher that 
he is and the pitcher that he’s 
gonna be from here on out.”
Saturday 
afternoon, 
the 
Wolverines’ hurlers struggled 
in 
pivotal 
moments. 
Junior 
right-hander 
Karl 
Kauffman 
appeared to have better control 
on the mound, but his periods 
of solid pitching were mixed in 

with crucial mistakes. In the 
second inning, a two-run home 
run opened the scoring for the 
Buckeyes. In the third inning, 
Kauffman gave up a solo home 
run and later a three-run shot to 
blow the game open.
But 
Kauffman 
remained 
resilient. 
He 
posted 
nine 
strikeouts and after Ohio State’s 
big third inning, had consecutive 
1-2-3 
innings, 
allowing 
his 
offense 
to 
stage 
a 
mini-
comeback. 
But 
unfortunately 
for 
the 
Wolverines, 
the early deficit 
was too much 
to 
overcome 
in a 10-4 loss 
that 
clinched 
the 
weekend 
series 
for 
the 
Buckeyes.
“The thing Ohio State did is 
they hit mistakes,” Bakich said. 
“And we made some mistakes 
with some pitches, especially in 
some two strike counts where 
we were ahead and they hit some 
home runs and they got some big 
hits in those moments. So Karl 
actually had pretty good stuff, 
he just made some mistakes 
with some of his pitches and 
they got hit and we got down to 
the early deficit.”

Wolverines drop seventh-straight 
game, 17-7, against Nittany Lions

Despite 
reaching 
two 
milestones, there was little for 
the Michigan men’s lacrosse 
team to be excited about after 
the clock hit zero.
A 
matchup 
against 
the 
nation’s No. 1 team in Penn 
State 
(3-0 
Big 
Ten, 
10-1 
overall), proved to be too much 
for the Wolverines (0-3, 3-8), 
as they dropped their seventh 
game in a row in a 17-7 defeat.
While Michigan looked to 
be in control during the game’s 
opening minutes, the Nittany 
Lions struck first with a man-
up goal following a penalty 
on senior defenseman Nick 
DeCaprio. 
The 
Wolverines 
surrendered 
another 
goal 
from close range 30 seconds 
later, though they managed 
to slice the deficit in half on 
a transition goal from junior 
midfielder Avery Myers. Penn 
State barely flinched, finishing 
the quarter by scoring five 
consecutive goals, including 
four in the span of a minute 
and a half.

“We 
knew 
Penn 
State 
(would 
come) 
out 
firing,” 
said Michigan coach Kevin 
Conry. “They’ve pretty much 
outscored their opponents in 
the first quarter by a significant 
margin. …We knew we had to 
handle their pressure early and 
didn’t.”
While 
the 
Wolverines 
proved 
unable 
to 
handle 
Penn 
State’s 
pressure in the 
game’s opening 
frame, 
they 
strung together 
a 
run 
in 
the 
second quarter, 
outscoring 
the 
Nittany 
Lions, 
4-2, and heading into the 
locker room trailing just 9-5. 
Myers notched an assist and 
scored two goals in the period, 
including one with ten seconds 
remaining 
after 
DeCaprio 
found him following a steal. 
The steal was one of eight 
forced turnovers by DeCaprio, 
who set the program’s single-
game 
record 
for 
forced 

turnovers 
and 
enabled 
Michigan to earn a bevy of 
transition opportunities in the 
quarter.
“(He’s) great at pushing the 
tempo and getting upfield,” 
Myers said.
With 8:42 remaining in the 
third quarter, senior midfielder 
Decker Curran 
scored off a feed 
from freshman 
attacker Bryce 
Clay to register 
his 
100th 
career 
point, 
becoming 
just 
the 
fourth 
player 
in 
program 
history 
to 
accomplish 
the feat. Penn State quickly 
rebounded — finishing the 
game on a run that saw it score 
seven consecutive goals and 
dominate time of possession 
— 
overshadowing 
Curran’s 
accomplishment.
“I’m not thinking about the 
accomplishment,” Curran said. 
“I’m thinking about how we 
can win these next two games.”
