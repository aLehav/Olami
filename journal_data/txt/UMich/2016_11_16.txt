A 
project 
created 
by 

Christopher 
Ruf, 
professor 

of atmospheric science and 
electrical engineering at the 
University of Michigan, will 
culminate with the launch of 
a $151 million Cyclone Global 
Navigation Satellite System Dec. 
12.

The launch was announced 

Friday 
by 
the 
University. 

CYGNSS, whose inaugural flight 
will be from Cape Canaveral 
Air Force Base, has been a 
collaborative 
effort 
between 

Ruf’s team and NASA.

Ruf said the project aims to 

measure previously unknown 

details on hurricane systems, 
such as surface winds and 
precipitation fields, to provide 
more frequent and accurate 
measurements throughout the 
life cycle of tropical storms and 
hurricanes. According to a NASA 
press release, the project will be 
a “fundamental improvement in 
hurricane forecasting.”

EJ Olson, marketing and 

communications specialist for 
the Department of Atmospheric, 
Oceanic and Space Sciences 
in the College of Engineering, 
said CYGNSS is revolutionary 
because of its ability to penetrate 
the heavy rain of a hurricane’s 
eyewall.

“This will give scientists, for 

first time, the ability to see into 

The 
chant 
“No 
Trump, 

no KKK, no racist, sexist 
U.S.A.,” echoed throughout 
the University of Michigan 
campus Tuesday night as more 
than 100 students, faculty and 
community members attended 
a rally and march described 
as 
stopping 
“Trump’s 

racist vision for America.” 
The University chapter of 
BAMN — the Coalition to 
Defend Affirmative Action, 
Integration and Immigrant 
Rights and Fight for Equality 
By Any Means Necessary — 
organized the event.

The march aimed to defend 

immigrant rights and advocate 
against 
the 
militarization 

of the United States-Mexico 
border, citing President-elect 
Donald 
Trump’s 
campaign 

pushes to build a wall between 
the U.S. and Mexico and 
incarcerate or depart two to 
three million undocumented 
immigrants. 
Additionally, 

the protest addressed recent 
ethnic intimidation attacks 
on campus since Trump was 
elected president.

In the first incident, a white 

male threatened to light a 
female Muslim student on 
fire if she did not remove her 
hijab Friday. Additionally, a 
male student woke up to find 
a swastika painted on his 
apartment door, and another 
female student was yelled 
at for being in America and 

pushed down a hill by two 
men 
referencing 
religion. 

Immediately 
following 
the 

election last week, the Rock 
was also painted with the 
phrases “fuck America” and 
“kill ‘em all” over logos of the 
Republican and Democratic 
parties.

Before the rally, Art & 

Design 
sophomore 
Keysha 

Wall, an organizer of the 
event and member of BAMN, 

said the purpose is to show 
solidarity 
with 
minority 

students and make it known 
that 
ethnic 
intimidation 

crimes will not be tolerated.

“Specifically 
after 
the 

Muslim woman was attacked 
on campus, it was even a fight 
to have UM DPSS mark this as 
a hate crime … this has been 
necessary,” Wall said. “It is 
necessary as soon as possible 
to make a stand and remind 

those bigots that they don’t 
get to get away with this. They 
don’t get to get away with 
threatening and intimidating 
anybody on this campus.”

At the start of the event, 

attendees gathered in the 
Diag and listened to event 
organizers as they brought 
forth their concerns regarding 
Trump’s policies.

Police later followed behind 

An opioid addiction epidemic 

that has taken lives across the 
country has had significant 
impacts in Washtenaw County, 
prompting 
the 
community 

forum “An Opioid Crisis in 
Washtenaw County: What Can 
We Do?” Tuesday at the Ann 
Arbor District Library.

The event was hosted by 

the University of Michigan 
Depression Center, part of the 
Bright Nights community forum 
series.

Nursing 
Prof. 
Stephen 

Strobbe began the forum by 
outlining the scope of the opioid 
epidemic locally and nationally, 
as well as suggesting causes of 
the crisis.

Strobbe 
said 
there 
were 

48,000 opioid-related overdoses 
in 2015 alone, a number that has 
been rising exponentially. He 
attributed the primary cause of 
addiction to opioid prescribing 
practices in the United States.

“There 
were 
enough 

prescriptions written in the 
past year to supply every single 
adult in the United States with

Two hundred students gathered in the Modern Languages Building Tuesday night for a debate over a Central Student Government resolution that called on the Uni-
versity of Michigan to divest its investments in several companies that allegedly commit human rights violations against Palestinians. The resolution failed. 

At 
their 
weekly 
meeting 

Tuesday, 
Central 
Student 

Government voted 34 to 13 
to reject a resolution that 
would 
have 
called 
on 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan 
to 

divest its investments in several 
companies 
that 
allegedly 

commit human rights violations 
against Palestinians.

The resolution, which was 

brought to the assembly by 
student organization Students 
Allied for Freedom and Equality, 
initially considered a range 
of companies, but was limited 

during the meeting to only 
Boeing, G4S, Hewlett-Packard 
and United 130 Technologies. 
This is the 10th attempt since 
2002 to pass the resolution at 
the University, including in the 
past two years, following in the 
path of similar resolutions at 
many other schools around the 
country. The vote this year was 

less close than it has been in 
previous years.

The 
resolution 
charged 

that 
University 
investments 

in 
these 
companies 
are 

unethical because they oppress 
Palestinians 
due 
to 
their 

business practices in Israel 
or products they produce. It

Throughout this semester, 

there 
has 
been 
ongoing 

discussion at Senate Advisory 
Committee on University Affairs 
meetings over the creation of a 
tri-campus task force between 
the different faculty governance 
structures at the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
Ann 
Arbor, 

Flint and Dearborn campuses. 
Details regarding the task force, 
including membership, may be 
determined at the next Senate 
Assembly meeting on Nov. 21.

SACUA

Silke-

Maria Weineck, chair of the 
Department 
of

Literature, said on Nov. 9 in an 
interview discussion for the 
creation of a tri-campus task 
force began this semester due to 
concerns from representatives 
of Flint and Dearborn regarding 
governance 
issues 
at 
their 

respective 
campuses. 
In 

particular, she said there is 
confusion over how the faculty 
governance structures at each

A woman’s face was cut by 

an unknown assailant Tuesday 

afternoon as she was walking on 

Liberty Street, according to the 

Ann Arbor Police Department.

The woman, who is in her early 

20’s, said she was walking down 

the street wearing headphones 

and was unaware if her attacker 

addressed her before cutting her 

face.

AAPD Sheriff Patrick Ouellette 

said the woman was walking from 

Angell Hall to Starbucks, and was 

attacked after leaving the cafe 

while headed eastbound on Liberty 

Street towards the Michigan 

Theatre. He could not confirm 

whether the woman is a University 

of Michigan student.

“She was walking up the 

sidewalk when the subject came up 

from behind her and scratched her 

left cheek with a safety pin he was 

holding in his hand,” Ouellette said.

The suspect then ran out 

towards State Street. He was 

described as a white male in his 40s 

wearing a black baseball cap and 

a dark colored hoodie with dark 

sweatpants. He could not confirm 

a motive.

“There was no conversation 

between the victim and the 

suspect, so it was unknown why 

he came up to her,” Ouellette said. 

“Why he did this, we don’t know.”

He added that the victim’s 

injuries were minimal, and the 

superficial wound over her cheek 

didn’t require stitches.

Ouellette said AAPD will 

pass the case on to their detective 

division to follow up on the case.

LSA senior Maddie Luros pours water on the chalk political slogans that Victor Sedlak, who stated he was a former student at Michigan State Univer-
sity, is in the process of writing as he stops to talk to another student on the Diag Tuesday.

Tuesday 
afternoon 
on 

the Diag, a man wrote both 
President-elect Donald Trump 

and Democratic presidential 
nominee 
Hillary 
Clinton’s 

campaign slogans in chalk 
with the aim of sending a 
message 
about 
oppression 

people face for expressing 
political viewpoints in the 

current climate.

The man, Victor Sedlak, who 

stated he was a former student 
at Michigan State University, 
said he first wrote Trump’s 
campaign 
slogan, 
“Make 

America Great Again,” and 

then 
Clinton’s 
campaign 

slogan, “Stronger Together,” 
on the Diag to gauge how 
people would react and 
illustrate how students of 
minority political views can 
face discrimination.

“People 
harassed 
me,” 

Sedlak said. “The general 
message is you can be 
conservative with liberals 
and no one is probably going 
to hurt you, and you can be 
liberal with conservatives 
and no one is probably going 
to hurt you. They won’t hurt 
you, but they will sure as 
shit discriminate against 
you.”

On 
Sunday 
night, 

hundreds 
of 
University

Michigan 
community 

members signed a petition 
condemning recent protests 
and vigils held on campus, as 
well as statements made by 
University administrators,

the eye of the storm, and give 
a better understanding of sea 
process during these events,” 
Olson said. “We have a team of 
scientist here at Michigan, along 
with a few Ph.D.s, for this project. 
It has truly been a department-
wide effort.”

According to NASA’s blog 

on the project, CYGNSS will 
be able to penetrate the eyes of 
storms through a system of eight 
microsatellite 
observatories. 

Through GPS technology, the 
stations 
will 
measure 
radio 

waves reflected from the Earth 
originally caused by satellites 
used for phone calls, Internet and 
many other common uses.

Each of the eight satellites 

will carry a GPS receiver that 
measures the strength of the 

signal from the Earth’s oceans. 
When the signal is strong, this 
means the ocean is in a state of 
calm; if it is weak, there is a lot of 
wave activity with strong winds.

In a May interview with 

NASA, Damen Provost, project 
manager and physics researcher 
at the University, said they 
were testing the satellites using 
several methods to ensure their 
continued functionality in the 
hostile environment of space.

“For the space environment, 

there are thermal and vacuum 
issues, so we have a chamber 
that can simulate what CYGNSS 
will see in orbit,” Provost said. 
“We have a vibration table that 
can shake it, it is a bumpy ride up 
to space. If anything breaks we 
want to make sure we can fix it 
here on the ground.”

CYGNSS is expected to be 

used for two hurricane seasons 
and will return to Earth after 
about two years in orbit.

semester, 
several 
members 

of faculty governance at the 
satellite campuses — including 
Jerry 
Sanders, 
UM-Flint 

associate professor of biology, 
Sarah Lippert, an associate 
professor of art history at 
UM-Flint 
and 
Quamrul 

Mazumder, UM-Flint associate 
professor 
of 
mechanical 

engineering 
— 
 
discussed 

concerns about the structure of 
and faculty role in governance. 
Of the faculty members in 
attendance was Robert Fraser, 
associate director of graduate 
programs, 
research 
and 

scholarly 
communication 
at 

UM-Dearborn.

In an interview Tuesday, 

Fraser 
reiterated 
the 

discrepancies that arise due 

to differences in governance 
structures at each campus. He 
noted the University Senate 
Assembly in Ann Arbor is 
composed of all the voting-
eligible 
faculty 
from 
the 

University, which includes all 
three campuses. According to 
the board’s bylaws, decisions 
made by the Senate Assembly 
are binding actions on the 
three 
university 
faculties. 

However, Fraser noted that 
decisions made at this level 
often do not extend to the Flint 
and Dearborn campuses due to 
miscommunication.

“If at the University Senate 

Assembly in Ann Arbor … 
everybody votes for a particular 
proposition over which we have 
authority, jurisdiction, binding 
action. 
In 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 

structure, it is enabled usually 
within a very short period 
of time,” Fraser said. “Often 
at Dearborn and Flint, the 

communication is not made or 
the authority is not recognized, 
and there is no effect on either 
Dearborn or Flint with their 
faculty governance.”

Weineck said while SACUA 

and 
the 
Senate 
Assembly 

are meant to cover all three 
campuses, 
representation 
is 

mostly from Ann Arbor faculty. 
Additionally, Ann Arbor does 
not have a separate faculty 
governance structure like the 
Flint and Dearborn campuses 
do.

In part because of this, the 

tri-campus task force will assess 
differences in the governance 
structures and determine how 
the three campuses can better 
work together, Weineck said.

“We’ll look at two things: 

first, have a task force with 
representation from all three 
campuses that explores how 
faculty governance works at the 
three campuses and whether 

there’s room for improvement, 
either 
in 
structure 
or 
in 

practice,” 
Weineck 
said. 

“Second, 
to 
explore 
how 

the 
faculty 
governance 

organizations 
on 
the 
three 

campuses can strengthen each 
other, perhaps better, and work 
with each other and whether 
we need to maybe reconsider 
or make suggestions on how to 
change the current structure.”

UM-Dearborn 
Associate 

Economics Prof. Chris Douglas, 
chair of the Faculty Council at 
UM-Flint, said in an interview 
Tuesday he hopes the task force 
will strengthen the governance 
ties 
between 
the 
three 

campuses.

“We’re separate universities, 

but we’re all in the Michigan 
system, so I think we’re looking 
for ways to work more closely 
together on issues related to the 
faculty governance,” Douglas 
said.

attendees as they marched in 
the streets throughout campus, 
taking a route past popular 
buildings and residence halls. 
There have been several BAMN 
rallies 
on 
other 
university 

campuses similar to Tuesday’s, 
including 
two 
at 
Wayne 

State 
University 
last 
week 

and another one in Detroit 
occurring Tuesday as well.

LSA 
sophomore 
Elena 

Schmitt, a member of the 
LGBT Michigan organization, 
said prior to the event she had 
watched a man writing Trump’s 
campaign 
slogan, 
“Make 

America Great Again,” in chalk 
on the Diag. Schmitt said after 
talking with the man, who 
defended Trump’s platform, 
she saw how necessary action 
and rallies were.

“The most alarming part was 

how much he excused Donald 
Trump’s … language against 
women — the ‘grab women 
by 
the 
pussy’ 
comment,” 

Schmitt said. “And I asked 
him about the sexual assault 
allegations, and he said that 
it doesn’t matter. He said the 
University of Michigan says 
that conservatives don’t have 
the freedom of speech.”

Schmitt added that the rise 

in instances of discrimination 
on campus — which she found 
surprising due to the perception 
of Ann Arbor as liberal-leaning 
— was another primary reason 
she attended the rally.

A Ypsilanti resident who only 

gave his name as Steve said he 
drove through heavy traffic 
to make the rally because he 
thought it was crucial for all 
community members to be 
present.

“We need to stand up to the 

hate and oppression that a lot 
of people are getting, and those 

of us in a position to be able to 
act and to be involved should 
be acting and getting involved,” 
Steve said.

Rackham 
student 
Lamin 

Manneh 
said 
he 
attended 

because he has concerns about 
Trump’s immigration policies, 
citing Trump’s proposed ban 
on Muslim immigration during 
his campaign in particular.

“One of the main concerns 

is immigrants and what this 
new administration is going to 
do with regards to immigrant 
issues, which will probably 
make life very hard for a lot of 
immigrants — both documented 
and undocumented,” Manneh 
said. “For me, it’s important 
that we do not normalize 
Trump’s presidency and that 
we are in a constant state of 
protest.”

Event organizers announced 

that they are planning to have 
a similar march Thursday night 
as well.

a bottle of opioid medication,” 
he said.

Strobbe 
highlighted 
in 

particular the role health care 
practitioners play, saying the 
number of opioid prescriptions 
that have been written for 
between 1999 and 2014 have 
quadrupled 
as 
managing 

patient pain has become a 
priority in treatment.

Localizing the issue, Strobbe 

noted 
that 
in 
Washtenaw 

County in 2011, there were 29 
opioid related deaths. In 2014, 
there were more than 65.

“So 
what 
has 
happened 

here at home?” Strobbe asked 
the crowd. “The graphs look 
very similar to what they do 
nationally and that is that we 
saw a marked increase in just 
the period from 2011 to 2014 
among 
Washtenaw 
County 

residents alone.”

According to the Washtenaw 

County Public Health Opioid 
Report from June of this year, 
since October 2015, there have 
been about 20 Washtenaw 
County residents who have 
overdosed 
on 
opioids. 
Of 

those incidences of overdose, 
25 percent of overdoses were 
fatal.

Opioid and heroin overdose 

data show that there have been 
45 opioid-related deaths in 
Washtenaw County in 2016.

Marci Scalera, clinical and 

substance use disorder services 
director of the Community 
Mental 
Health 
Partnership 

of 
Southeast 
Michigan, 

emphasized 
the 
importance 

of talking about this crisis and 
the work her organization is 
currently doing to address the 
issue.

“Many people don’t have 

an 
understanding 
of 
how 

prevalent the problem is, so we 
are … wanting to ensure that 
people understand that this is 
a problem, we want to reduce 
stigma, we want to save lives 
and we want to get folks into 
treatment,” Scalera said.

Nursing Prof. Gina Dahlem 

also 
highlighted 
several 

successful 
efforts 
to 
train 

Washtenaw County community 
members on how to administer 
opioid 
overdose 
reversal 

medications.

“Since we first started to 

train the sheriff’s department 
in August 2015, within the 
first two weeks, we had our 

first officer that was able to 
use (intranasal) naloxone to 
reverse an opioid overdose,” 
Dahelm said.

Two of the other panelists, 

former heroin addicts who 
are 
currently 
in 
long-term 

recovery, also shared their 
experiences.

“At the very end of my 

addiction, I was sleeping in 
my car for weeks at a time, I 
weighed 30 pounds less than 
what I weigh today, my hair was 
falling out,” said Washtenaw 
County resident Ashton Marr, 
an Eastern Michigan University 
student. “I was miserable, I was 
tired and I knew I couldn’t go 
on like that.”

While 
many 
panelists 

focused 
on 
the 
success 

of 
training 
efforts 
and 

community 
involvement 
in 

the administration of opioid 
overdose 
reversal 
drugs, 

Dahlem also noted how to 
recognize an overdose during 
a Q&A session after the panel.

“If the person does not 

respond in a loud voice and you 
see signs of shallow breathing 
… blue lips, blue fingernails, 
lack of oxygenation, as well as 
unconsciousness … then you 
can suspect that person is in 
opioid overdose,” Dahlem said.

#NotMyCampus 
letter 
to 

administrators written by LSA 
sophomore Amanda Delekta. 

Last Wednesday, a vigil and 

anti-Trump 
rally 
attracted 

a 
crowd 
of 
nearly 
1,000 

University 
students, 
faculty 

and staff, as well as community 
members, 
in 
protest 
of 

President-elect 
Donald 

Trump’s win.

About 30 students gathered 

as Sedlak was writing “Make 
America Great Again,” and 
some poured water on each 
letter in response after he 
wrote 
it. 
Minutes 
later, 

when Sedlak began writing 
“Stronger Together,” students 
continued to pour water over 
the message.

LSA 
senior 
Sean 
Smith 

arrived on the scene after one 
of his friends notified him that 
someone was chalking the Diag 
with Trump’s campaign slogan, 
and said he came to wash it off.

“Somebody told me we had 

a (Trump) supporter writing 
“Make America Great Again” 

in the middle of the Diag,” 
Smith said. “We just came in 
here to get this off the Diag.”

Smith said he didn’t take 

issue with Sedlak trying to 
express his political views, 
but was bothered that Sedlak 
was writing “Make America 
Great Again,” a message that 
he said he believes represents 
exclusion of minorities, racism 
and fascism.

“It’s 
not 
necessarily 
the 

fact that he was expressing 
his political beliefs, it’s more 
so the implications behind 
that statement and what it’s 
emblematic of — I think that’s 
what people had a problem 
with,” Smith said. “I personally 
had a problem with him putting 
“Make America Great Again” 
in the Diag, because who does 
that then exclude from that 
narrative?”

Smith 
said 
he 
was 
not 

impressed with any broader 
message Sedlak was trying 
to 
spread, 
especially 
after 

witnessing Sedlak take off 
his red “Make America Great 
Again” hat and put on a hat 
bearing 
Clinton’s 
campaign 

logo.

“He’s basically trying to be 

a troll,” Smith said. “He thinks 

he’s the Riddler or something 
like that. He’s trying to cover 
up what he’s doing by playing 
both sides, but it’s not working 
— that’s what I’m gathering 
from it.”

When asked if Sedlak could 

be initiating a dialogue, Smith 
said he didn’t think so.

“He’s 
not 
inciting 

conversation,” he said.

Police briefly arrived at the 

scene to monitor the situation 
from afar, but declined to 
comment 
on 
the 
situation, 

saying 
there 
was 
nothing 

illegal happening.

An LSA student who gave 

only his first name, Robby, 
said he was also confused as 
to what the message was, but 
recognized Sedlak had a right 
to free speech.

“This guy is either a jokester 

— I’m not quite sure what he 
is — but he was exercising his 
right to free speech,” Robby 
said. “Everyone got triggered 
over nothing.”

Sedlak 
said 
the 
whole 

incident was also part of a 
marketing ploy for his website 
on American politics.

“It 
was 
an 
elaborate 

marketing ploy and it worked 
brilliantly,” Sedlak said.

Nursing Prof. Stephen Strobbe introduces panelists for a discussion of the dangers of opium at the Ann Arbor District 
Library on Tuesday.

would not have automatically 
ensured divestment from the 
investments, but rather would 
have called on the University’s 
Board of Regents to form an 
ad-hoc committee to investigate 
the University’s investments in 
the area.

“Israeli 
state 
policy 

infringes 
upon 
Palestinian 

human rights,” the resolution 
read. 
“The 
University 
of 

Michigan’s investments in the 
aforementioned 
companies, 

which are involved in socially 
irresponsible 
and 
unethical 

activities 
in 
Palestine, 
not 

only 
personally 
impact 

Palestinian students at the 
University of Michigan, but 
also calls into question the 
University’s 
commitment 
to 

invest in socially responsible 
companies.”

The resolution also stated that 

divestment would defund the 
“weapons and equipment used 

in Israel’s illegal occupation 
of Palestinian territories and 
in violation of international 
human rights law.”

However, some opponents 

of the resolution charged that 
voting in favor of divestment 
would gesture to the student 
body that a decision had been 
reached on the issue for the 
assembly as a whole, dividing 
communities 
and 
ending 

dialogue on the issue.

LSA junior Joe Goldberg, 

a CSG representative, said he 
voted against the resolution 
because he said it challenges 
what he stands for as a member 
of the Jewish faith with a 
complicated relationship with 
Israel.

“This resolutions challenges 

the core of what I stand for...
this resolution calls for the 
delegitimization of Israel and 
that is not what the majority 
of this campus stands for,” 
Goldberg said. “This resolution 
divides and more important pits 
students against each other.”

For 
the 
debate 
on 
the 

resolution, 
CSG 
moved 
its 

meeting from its chambers 
in the Michigan Union to the 
Modern 
Language 
Building 

to accommodate nearly 200 
student 
attendees. 
Many 

hundreds 
more 
watched 
a 

Michigan Daily livestream of 
the proceedings. The more than 
four-hour long meeting, which 
also 
considered 
other 
CSG 

business, drew many speakers 
on both sides of the resolution.

History 
Prof. 
Victor 

Lieberman, who teaches classes 
on 
the 
Israeli-Palestinian 

conflict and has addressed 
the body on the past few 
occassions 
divestment 
has 

been 
discussed, 
also 
spoke 

out against the resolution. He 
charged that it did not meet 
the three prongs for divestment 
outlined by the University — 
that the institution must be 
uniquely responsible for the 
problem, there were moral or 
ethical issues surrounding the 
support of that institution, and 
consensus at the University 
against that group.

The 
University 
has 
only 

divested twice in its history, 

from South Africa over “serious 
moral or ethical questions” 
raised 
by 
its 
policies 
of 

apartheid and from tobacco 
companies in 2000. In 2015, 
CSG voted to formulate an ad 
hoc committee to investigate 
the University’s investments 
in fossil fuels, a precedent 
the resolution drew on in its 
argumentation.

Public Policy senior Lucky 

Mulperi, a CSG representative, 
said he voted for the resolution 
because he wanted to represent 
the small faction of Palestinian 
students on campus.

“I’m an Indian Hindu, so I 

have no real personal stake in 
this besides my own concerns. 
But 
Mathma 
Ghandi 
went 

ahead and said with a small 
group of people, India needs 
to lead,” Mulperi said. “I really 
think that is the most important 
thing for all to realize that 
these discussions will never 
occur unless as...a small group 
of 
thoughtful, 
committed 

students change the world.”

University alum Devin Jones, 

who said he was a Palestinian 

citizen, told the story of his 
mother and grandfather, born 
in the same house on the same 
street, but facing drastically 
different political climates in 
their lifetimes.

“But she was born in a different 

state… We were not indigenous 
to our own land because we 
were on the wrong side of a 
battle, a battle that wasn’t our 
fault,” Jones said. “Basically, we 
were stripped of our Palestinian 
identities and forced to become 
Israeli citizens.”

Public 
Policy 
senior 

Matt Fidel said for him, the 
resolution does not represent 
peace, and instead is seeking 
for a scapegoat in the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict.

“Divestment 
emboldens 

the radical wings of Israeli 
and Palestinian governments, 
which oppose peace,” Fidel said. 
“Divestment drives our campus 
apart at a time when we need to 
come together the most…it will 
only fan the flames of conflict 
both over there and right here 
on campus.”

“We should all pray for a day 

when peace can be achieved 
between Israeli and Palestinian 
citizens. We should pray for 
a future when Israeli and 
Palestinian families do not 
have to face the threat of daily 
violence. We should pray for a 
future when Palestinians are 
able to live in an independent 
Palestinian state free of any 
Israeli interference.”

After the resolution failed, 

many 
CSG 
representatives 

discussed why they voted in 
favor of the resolution. During 
this, several attendees began 
to shout and chant. CSG Vice 
President 
and 
LSA 
senior 

Micah Griggs allowed Jones to 
speak to the body.

“When you argue on the 

claim that we did not know 
what we were talking about, 
that you are somehow better 
than us...that is the epitome 
of privilege,” Jones said. “[I 
am] paying tuition, in which 
a portion of my tuition goes 
to companies that go to the 
oppression of my people...You 
have to live with this. You have 
to stare me in the the face.”

L

ike so many others, I woke 
up several days after the 
election hoping I was 

still only trapped in a horrible 
nightmare. I was scared to walk 
outside — not only because of 
the tangible fear of living in this 
country with Donald Trump 
as president, but because doing 
so felt like I was starting to 
accept that this is my country, 
regardless of how foreign it feels. 
I cried just twice before noon — 
an improvement from the days 
before — and went to class for the 
first time in a week. The gravity 
of what will come of our next 
presidential administration is 
still unknown, but as I continue 
to talk to people around me, I 
hear more and more of us saying 
we are ready to fight.

Last night, I stood in a room 

with more than 100 people from 
just Washtenaw County, all of 
us having volunteered our time 
to Hillary Clinton’s campaign. On 
my left was a middle-aged, gay, 
white man, and on my right was an 
elderly Black woman. When one of 
the organizers, a young Muslim 
man, got up to speak, he said what 
I was thinking: Our volunteers 
look like America. The thing about 
elections is that they’re all about 
numbers, and the numbers say 
nothing about our intensity, our 
love and our fervor.

Hillary 
Clinton 
won 
the 

popular vote, which means that 
more people in this country 
voted for the most qualified 
presidential 
candidate 
this 

country has ever seen over 
someone who only had to tap 
into hatred that has existed 
for centuries. Hillary Clinton 
won the popular vote, which 
means that more people in this 
country are ready to fight than 
to hate. Many higher-educated 
and 
higher-income 
people 

voted for Clinton, which means 
that our fight will have more 
funding, more strategy and more 
experience. There are too many 
people of color, women, queer 
folks and people with hearts 
who will not give up over the 
next four years, just as Clinton 
hasn’t given up for the past 30. 
The numbers don’t show that our 
team is stacked. 

If you voted for Donald 

Trump or Gary Johnson or Jill 
Stein or wrote in Bernie Sanders, 
I challenge you to think about 
how the people of color, LGBTQ 
folks, 
undocumented 
people, 

people with disabilities, woman-
identifying people or any other 
marginalized person you have 
ever met will be affected by a 
Trump presidency. And then 
I challenge you to think about 
how you will be affected by 
a Trump presidency. If that 
disparity makes you sad, angry 
or uncomfortable, then I want 
you on our team, because this 
dangerous 
embarrassment 
is 

your America now, too.

Our presidential election has 

made me fear for my safety and 
the safety of those around me. 
But if we are going to wake up 
every morning terrified, then 
those of us who are ready to 
fight must force ourselves to 
understand why fear won this 
election. Whether it was the fear 
of a challenge to whiteness or 
the fear of losing more jobs, the 
sentiments that captivated so 
many people in this country are 
valid. Rather than radicalizing 
people who were motivated by 
that fear, we should work to 
address it alongside the fear 
that systemically marginalized 
people have felt throughout this 
country’s history.

Donald 
Trump 
is 
our 

president, and this is our country, 
and denial is only the first stage 
of grief. But if we want change, 
we can never tolerate the final 

stage as acceptance. This cannot 
be like another mass shooting 
or episode of police violence, 
during which the pain wanes 
over time. Perhaps we let go of 
that pain because our society is 
quick to absolve a usually white 
shooter of blame, and to accept 
police violence against Blacks 
as nothing extraordinary or 
needing special attention. This 
pain is not new to marginalized 
communities, and we should 
look to them as examples and 
leaders in this fight.

As time goes on, may we 

never settle into this — may we 
always be uncomfortable with 
the hatred and resentment that 
people in this country have 
accepted as normal or even 
desirable. We will learn new 
coping mechanisms and agents 
of change as time goes on, but we 
must never forget how we felt on 
Nov. 9. That pain will stay with us 
every day, and we will counter it 
with the knowledge that change 
only happens when we show up 
more than once every four years 
on Election Day.

On Feb. 1, 2016, I stood in 

Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and watched 
the first woman in history win a 
presidential caucus. That was 
one of many cracks in a glass 
ceiling thicker than we thought 
it was. I have no doubt that we 
will throw everything we have 
until it shatters all over anyone 
who doubts the resilience of 
our communities. As a woman, 
as a queer person, as a Jew, 
I will continue to wake up 
terrified. But as someone who 
has 
worked 
relentlessly 
on 

Clinton’s campaign for the past 
15 months, I will believe in the 
passions of people who will 
never quit working to keep the 
dream of progress, safety and 
humanity alive.

Refusing those who want to help

DANIEL ANTHONY | OP-ED

D

ear Vice President Harper,

Last week, I received 

an 
email 
from 
you 

reminding 
students 
of 
the 

35th annual Blood Battle with 
Ohio State. In your email, you 
encouraged students to sign up to 
donate blood, helping “us win and 
… save lives.” I’m responding to 
you now to say that even though 
I am a healthy, able-bodied young 
man, I will not be donating blood. 
I will not because I cannot, and 
this is because I am a gay student 
at the University of Michigan.

In your letter, you informed 

me that throughout the drive’s 
existence, 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan has collected enough 
blood to save the lives of more 
than 644,000 people. This grand 
accomplishment is something we 
should be proud of: These are lives 
that matter. Yet, I can’t help but feel 
that we can improve the manner in 
which we conduct this meaningful 
public health initiative.

As you are probably aware, 

under 
the 
current 
FDA 

regulations 
the 
Red 
Cross 

cannot legally accept blood from 
a “man who has had sex with 
another man during the past 12 
months.” Gay men are not alone 
in these regulations.

They also apply to any “female 

who has had sex during the past 
12 months with a man who has 
had sex with another man in the 
past 12 months.” Consequently, 
the FDA requires blood from 
these groups of people to be 
deferred unless a person of this 
group abstains from sex for 12 
consecutive months. This directly 
“defers” the donations of all 
sexually active gay men, bisexual 
men and any heterosexual or 

bisexual women who have had 
sex with gay or bisexual men.

I am aware that donating 

blood saves lives. I am aware that 
HIV disqualifies any infected 
individual from donating blood. 
I am aware that the majority of 
newly diagnosed HIV cases are 
within the gay demographic. 
I am aware that “window 
periods” make detecting the 
disease less certain. I am aware 
that the FDA and the Red Cross 
take the health of the people 
receiving 
blood 
donations 

very 
seriously 
and 
consider 

their treatment of policy very 
thoughtfully and conservatively.

But I am also aware of research 

that suggests that an individual 
sexual risk assessment is just as 
effective as the prohibitory and 
generalizing policy that the FDA 
has adopted; that HIV can be 
prevented through the use of 
safe sex and even medication; 
and that it is mandated for 
health care professionals to 
screen donated blood for HIV 
prior to transfusion.

I would like to contextualize 

the FDA’s policy within our 
own 
University’s 
policy 
on 

non-discrimination. We, as a 
University 
community, 
claim: 

“The University of Michigan is 
committed to a policy of equal 
opportunity for all persons and 
does not discriminate on the basis 
of race, color, national origin, 
age, marital status, sex, sexual 
orientation, 
gender 
identity, 

gender 
expression, 
disability, 

religion, 
height, 
weight, 
or 

veteran status in employment, 
educational 
programs 
and 

activities, and admissions.” Yet, 
because of my sexual orientation, 
I am not offered the same 
opportunity to help my school 
or 
my 
community 
through 

participation of this historic blood 
drive. Instead I am “differed.”

Yes, I am “differed” along 

with those who, according to 
the Red Cross, “have ever used 
needles to take drugs … not 
prescribed by (their) doctor … 
have ever taken money, drugs 
or other payment for sex … (or) 
in the last 12 months have been 
in juvenile detention, lockup, 
jail, or prison for more than 72 
hours.” This bears the offensive 
implication that, because of my 
sexual orientation, I am inherently 
hazardous to my community.

In other words, my health, 

my lifestyle and my merit are 
questioned primarily on the 
basis that I am gay. Therefore, 
it seems to me that as a healthy, 
monogamous 
and 
responsible 

person, I am being unfairly and 
unnecessarily “differed” from 
one of the cornerstones of my 
University’s history.

This 
annual 
Blood 
Battle 

presents me with two choices: 
For 12 consecutive months, I 
can rebuke a part of my identity 
in order to donate blood, or I 
can live freely while accepting the 
systematic discrimination that the 
University perpetuates annually.

Neither of these options are 

ideal. So, perhaps, the 35th 
annual Blood Battle presents our 
University community with an 
opportunity to follow up on our 
self-attributed “Leaders and the 
Best” character. Perhaps, we can 
speak out against this implicit 
discrimination. Perhaps, we can 
unite to change our tradition into 
a wholly inclusive process.

Your email reminds me of this.
Sincerely,
Daniel Anthony

Collaborative disruption

O

ver 
the 
past 
week, 

the 
most 
uplifting 

words I’ve heard came 

from 
a 
classmate 

of mine: She said 
she has never felt 
more 
terrified 
of 

the 
future, 
and, 

simultaneously, she 
has never felt more 
immediately aware 
of her responsibility 
to help and to look 
out for other people, 
particularly people 
who are targeted by 
xenophobia, 
white 

supremacy and all 
that Donald Trump embodies.

Trump 
is 
the 
living, 

breathing 
manifestation 
of 

white supremacy. And he has 
just been given the keys to the 
most powerful position in the 
world. 
White 
supremacists, 

of course, have always been 
here, and the consequences 
of their ideologies have been 
made manifestly visible. We as 
a nation have barely been able 
to suppress the fact that we 
largely operate in a way that 
normalizes white supremacy 
(think of the habitual way in 
which we as a culture respond 
to murders of young Black 
men by police — outrage, “this 
cannot happen,” move on to 
the next story, repeat). But 
Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016, served 
as a coming-out party for white 
supremacy. No need to suppress 
it anymore. It is the definition of 
mainstream America.

For the most part, I have 

been 
really 
pleased 
with 

the outpouring of love from 
our University of Michigan 
community. People are talking 
about fundamentally changing 
their lives in response to this 
election — myself included. 
I am not going abroad next 
semester because I need to 
stay here and help. And I am 
not alone.

But I have also felt shocked 

at the silence in some of my 
classes. Interestingly enough, 
this silence pervades classes 
taught by white men and 
with students who are almost 
all white. In these classes, 
there is no mention of what is 

happening, of the hate crimes 
on our campus and in our nation. 
No mention of the fact that 

millions 
of 
people 

today fear for their 
lives. One professor 
ended a class of mine 
early, but stayed in 
the classroom, saying 
he feared for his life if 
he were to go outside.

And 
this 

ability to be silent 
demonstrates white 
privilege in practice. 
We 
can 
only 
be 

silent because none 
of 
these 
policies 

directly target our lives. We 
do not have to address Trump, 
we do not have to adjust 
our syllabi. Why would we? 
Instead, we will talk about it 
once, for 30 minutes, and move 
on. Relatively speaking, this 
is the same way in which we 
(speaking specifically to white 
people) digest the murders of 

young Black men by police. 

And so the response might 

be: But if it doesn’t affect you, 
why would the professor have 
to talk about it?

Because 
the 
professor’s 

job is to help educate us, the 
students, on the most pressing, 
urgent questions of our day. 
And these are not questions 
about 
the 
ways 
in 
which 

some dead white poet uses 
metaphor when talking about 
blackbirds or forests or snowy 
evenings. Instead, let’s talk 
about white privilege. Let’s 
talk about the fact that none of 
us apparently feel compelled to 
speak about what is happening 
in this country. Why is that? 
Since the election, I have had 
classes that could have taken 

place in any time throughout 
history at this university. This 
is unacceptable.

We need to be engaging 

with the questions of our time. 
We need to be reading and 
considering voices that grappled 
with these similar questions. 
Because, 
of 
course, 
these 

questions have always been 
relevant — white supremacy has 
always reigned in this country. 
So people have been responding 
to it every day, forever.

But 
times 
have 

fundamentally changed. We 
are now dealing with a man, 
our president, who has 20 
sexual 
assault 
allegations 

against him and who openly 
mocked a disabled reporter. 
We are dealing with a chief 
strategist who once told his 
wife that he didn’t want to send 
his kids to a certain school 
because he didn’t want his kids 
to be learning with Jews. This 
is our world.

Teachers, 
administrators: 

It is your job to prepare us 
for this world, to demand 
that we engage with what is 
going on. If this means having 
conversations 
with 
which 

you are uncomfortable, that 
is a good thing because that 
discomfort means, most likely, 
that you need this conversation 
just as we do. So why don’t we, 
students and teachers, if only 
for a moment, operate on some 
sort of a level playing field, in 
which we are all learning from 
one another about these icky 
terrifying issues?

Do not fear this sort of 

collaborative learning. Just as 
my peer told me last week, now, 
more than ever, we need to rely 
upon one another, to look out 
for one another, to help one 
another learn and be safe and 
continue to grow despite this 
monumental force of division 
that has been rewarded with 
the highest office in the world. 
Silence, on the other hand, favors 
this force. It is what it wants. Do 
not obey. Do not give in. Fight. 
Collaboratively disrupt.

MARTHA STEWART

There seem to be some ‘Blurred Lines’ in this photo.

Meek Mill is not a bad rapper. 

Let’s repeat that: Meek Mill is not 
a bad rapper.

If you’ve spent any time on 

Twitter in the last year, that 
might come as a surprise. After 
his horrible — absolutely horrible 
— handling of his beef with 
Drake, Mill became 
the face of “trash” 
rap, a nice hashtag 
that requires little 
effort or evidence to 
support, but takes up 
few characters out of 
the allotted 140.

But 
Mill’s 

rapping is not trash. 
Rather, Mill’s publicity skills and 
clearly anyone who could’ve said 
anything — seriously, anything 
at all — to him throughout that 
beef are. In some respects, he 
earned his criticism. A native of 
South Philadelphia, a product 
of a difficult upbringing which 
involved police brutality, the loss 
of his father to an armed robbery, 
and an intense, escapist focus on 
battle rapping in his teen years, 
Mill should have possessed the 
credibility and the experience to 
hold his own in a rap battle with a 
former “Degrassi” actor.

But Mill fell into the trap of 

appealing to Twitter to fight 
his battles. For a rapper who 
brandishes Glocks on his tracks, 
it came across as petty when he 
took to the internet platform to 
complain about Drake failing to 
“retweet” his album drop. Meek’s 
very valid critique about Drake 
hiring ghost writers rather than 
penning his own bars was buried 
in the Toronto native’s perfectly 
coordinated response.

Drake, following the cardinal 

social media rule which Mill 
seems to be completely oblivious 
to, appealed to the hashtag, to the 
slogan, rather than true credibility. 
Never mind that “Charged Up,” 
Drake’s initial response track, was 
underwhelming and skirted the 
issue at hand almost entirely. The 
true punch came in the timing — 
he dropped it on his brand new 
Apple Music Radio Show, just 

coming off a high from his well-
received release If You’re Reading 
This It’s Too Late, and curated 
and cut-down on his own social 
media to balance against Mill’s 
seemingly unhinged and childish 
slew of follow-up tweets.

While Mill should have just 

entered the studio and told it as it 
was, ignoring the internet entirely, 
he failed to understand the way 
these things work. By the time 

“Back to Back” 
came 
around 

he had already 
lost, his abysmal 
response 
track 

putting the nail in 
the coffin.

That 

background 
is 

essential to keep 

in mind with Mill’s first full-length 
release since that implosion. It’s 
clearly a moment which caused 
Mill an identity crisis as the 
public turned against him, and 
he uses DC4 to express some of 
that frustration. It’s a refreshing 
reminder of Mill’s rap prowess, 
but also brings up questions as to 
where that anger and that intense 
focus was when under pressure.

Still, DC4 largely succeeds in 

reaffirming that Mill still has 
skill behind the mic. He has a 
penchant for powerful opening 
tracks, and “On The Regular” 
delivers on this end. Recalling his 
first Dreamchasers mixtape and 
the opener to his last album, the 
track samples Carl Orff’s ominous 
“O Fortuna,” peppered with sharp 
gunshots. Mill is not holding his 
trigger finger back, and his bars 
are tight and pointed. But it’s no 
“Dreams and Nightmares,” and 
it won’t turn around detractors 
quite in the way his first track on 
his supposed “comeback project” 
should.

Like all of Mill’s projects, DC4 

fluctuates between strong flashes 
of brightness and throw-aways. 
It’s the stand-out individual tracks 
which support his projects, not the 
works as a whole, and DC4 is no 
different in that respect.

Take the transition between 

“Shine” and “Froze.” The former 
feels like the clearest response 
to his past beefs, and functions 
almost like a diss track in its ability 

to brush off his detractors and 
look to what matters, telling us on 
no uncertain terms, if it “Wasn’t 
for this music / I’d prolly be dead.” 
That high moment, though, moves 
to one of the missteps of the 
album, the Nicki Minaj and Lil Uzi 
assisted track “Froze.” It’s messy 
and lacks any cohesive rapping, 
save for a short stint by Minaj, to 
salvage itself. That back and forth 
can be a bit too common on this 
tape.

But 
while 
those 
two 

features don’t necessarily meet 
expectations, the guest list on this 
project is particularly important. 
It reads as a kind of who’s who of 
rap, as well as an alignment along 
pro-Drake, no-Drake lines. A 
number of rappers here have been 
involved in their own spats with 
the crooner, Tory Lanez and Pusha 
T being the most prominent.

At times those features have a 

tendency to overtake Mill himself. 
“Offended” is a Young Thug song 
in every way but name — that 
sparse, murky production and 
a never ending hook. You might 
have to listen to it more than once 
to even realize that Mill has a verse 
somewhere within the dominating 
interplay 
between 
Thug 
and 

up-and-comer 21 Savage. That 
the track is one of the highlights 
of the tape is a testament to the 
skill of the features, but also raises 
concerns for Mill’s own ability to 
craft a track. 

However, 
keeping 
to 
that 

back and forth mixtape pattern, 
Mill proves this worry wrong 
with “Lights Out,” perhaps the 
best track here. It’s classic Meek 
Mill, putting his angry bars at 
the forefront and keeping the 
production just bare enough to 
make its impact and fall away.

The end result is a mixed bag, 

equal parts moving and equal 
parts forgettable. The high notes, 
though, are high enough to place 
Mill back on his feet, and with 
some credibility regained at that. 
It’s not the roaring comeback 
that he could have used, and it’s 
hard to rationalize why he would 
continually push back and increase 
the anticipation for such a non-
explosive tape, but nonetheless 
it’s a solid reminder that Mill isn’t 
done quite yet.

ALBUM REVIEW

Stillness is the move in 

“Certain Women,” the latest 
film from acclaimed indie 
director 
Kelly 
Reichardt 

(“Night Moves”). 
An anthology film 
with 
segments 

that 
are 
only 

cursorily linked, 
“Certain Women” 
depicts the lives 
of 
four 
women 

in 
and 
around 

Livingston, 
Montana. 
The 

screenplay 
was 
adapted 

by Reichardt from a short 
story 
collection 
by 
Maile 

Meloy, a fiction writer from 
Montana. In one segment, 
Laura 
Wells 
(Laura 
Dern, 

“Wild”), a lawyer, tries to 
console her deranged client. In 
another, Gina Lewis (Michelle 
Williams, “Blue Valentine”) 
tries to buy sandstone from 
an elderly friend for a house 
she is building with her family 
from the ground up. In the 
third, Jamie (Lily Gladstone, 
in her film debut), a young 
rancher, strikes up an almost 
romantic friendship with Beth 
Travis (Kristen Stewart, “Still 
Alice”), who teaches a law 
class. 

Livingston 
sits 
at 
the 

foothills 
of 
Yellowstone 

and is one of those railroad 
towns, developed in the early 
20th 
century 
as 
migrant 

workers moved westward in 
search of new employment 
opportunities. But in 2016, the 
city hasn’t grown much and 

is struggling to maintain its 
old charm, which fades fast 
as populations shift to nearby 
Bozeman 
or 
Billings, 
the 

latter of which gets a mention 
toward the film’s beginning. 
Those who stay have limited 
opportunities, 
little 
work 

and bleak lives, 
covered 
in 
a 

thin 
layer 
of 

early 
winter 

snow. 
Among 

the 
rugged 

mountains that 
frame 
their 

small city, each 
woman is forging 
a new path for 

herself, but the resources are 
slim.

Reichardt’s 
commitment 

to molasses-like pacing can 
prove a deterrent — especially 
considering 
not 
too 
much 

really happens in each segment 
— but the performances she 
coaxes out of her actors are 
nothing short of superb. Dern 
as 
an 
experienced 
lawyer 

without the trust of her client, 
Fuller (Jared Harris, “Mad 
Men”), exhibits a repressed 
frustration surely shared by 
the 
perennially 
overlooked. 

She slips between sympathy 
for Fuller and an irritation 
at his deranged mental state. 
Williams is quietly devastating, 
a wife and businesswoman 
angry with her husband for 
accidentally creating divides 
between her and her daughter, 
while 
Rene 
Auberjonois 

(“M*A*S*H”) 
easily 

(hauntingly even) transforms 
into a confused elderly man. 
Stewart, 
experiencing 
a 

critical renaissance of her own, 

is a natural fit in Reichardt’s 
whispered world, engaging in 
dialogue devoid of the artifice 
that plagues too many other 
films.

Cinematographer 

Christopher 
Blauvelt 

(“Indignation”) aptly captures 
Livingston’s bleakly stagnant 
citizens. The camera, almost 
never 
moving, 
focuses 
in 

on each character, allowing 
a full display of thoughts, 
emotions, feelings, questions 
and, importantly, decisions. 
Blauvelt’s photography is a 
cinematic 
Minnesota 
nice, 

granting each individual their 
due time that seems to move 
westward across the Dakotas. 
That stillness, though, can be 
sinister. In one segment at a 
crime scene, tension mounts 
and the scant editing can make 
the heart pound.

The nature of sparseness 

in this film is such that 
whenever frills are added, they 
naturally carry more weight, 
tipping Reichardt’s hand ever 
so slightly to prove what is 
important and, perhaps, what 
can be dismissed. Scored music 
plays prominently one time, 
at a heartbreaking juncture 
in the film’s last third. For 
Jamie a brief respite from her 
unending hours on the farm 
must come to an end, and she’s 
left despondent. So, too, are our 
other characters, in their own 
ways. Perhaps that solemnity is 
rooted in the nature of modern 
society’s treatment of women. 
Maybe it’s just Montana in 
the quiet winter. Reichardt, 
either way, is uniquely gifted 
at capturing that deep desire to 
escape.

FILM REVIEW

For any flourishing television 

series, intercharacter chemistry 
is essential. The budding romance 
between Jim and Pam on “The 
Office” drew its fair 
share of viewers 
to the series when 
it was still on air. 
The same goes for 
various other series 
such 
as 
“Parks 

and 
Recreation” 

and “The Mindy 
Project,” to name 
a 
few. 
In 
the 

aforementioned 
examples, 
intercharacter 
dynamics propelled 
the series forward for many 
successful seasons. Whether these 
relationships are pre-established 
or 
not, 
successful 
character 

pairings have the potential to 
decide the fate of an up-and-
coming series. Schematics aside, 
“Martha & Snoop’s Potluck Dinner 
Party” is a lesson in building 
character 
dynamics 
and 
the 

importance of chemistry, even if 
the show takes a while to build the 
stars’s chemistry.

Throwing 
Martha 
Stewart 

into a kitchen occupied by stoners 
probably wasn’t the brightest idea. 
It’s hard not to notice Stewart’s 
blatant lack of interest from the 
beginning — in fact, she looks as 
if she’d rather be anywhere else. 
Despite the unlikely friendship 
that formed between Martha and 
Snoop Dogg back in 2008 on her 

show “Martha,” the two look a 
little uncomfortable working with 
each other on a more permanent 
basis.

When guest star Seth Rogen 

(“Sausage 
Party”) 
comes 
on 

stage, you can still feel a hint 
of discomfort emanating from 

Stewart. However, 
you can also begin 
to see a thaw in her 
personality, as the 
added 
company 

takes the banter 
from scripted to 
friendly. 
Perhaps 

the 
original 

awkwardness was 
a 
by-product 
of 

first episode jitters. 
From 
their 
long 

history 
together, 

you 
can 
assume 

Martha and Snoop’s friendship 
has had proper time to grow, 
something that comes out as the 
episode progresses onward. Yet, 
as an alum of network cooking 
shows, Martha does come off 
as territorial, working hard to 
overcome the scripted banter only 
to ultimately fall back into old 
routines.

Getting past Stewart’s robotic 

mannerisms in the start of the 
episode, the duo soon falls into 
a rhythm — a slow one at first, 
but a rhythm nonetheless. By 
the time special guest stars Wiz 
Khalifa and Ice Cube join the 
duo on stage, the ambiance is 
friendly and funny. Stewart and 
Snoop progressed through the 
episode from territorial beasts of 
their own specialties to a well-
oiled machine, the (vegetable) oil 

creating a smooth flow between 
the stoner and former network 
homemaker, lightheartedly joking 
as they batter some chicken. It’s 
nice to see the sudden change, as it 
promises that the concept behind 
a cooking show starring a rapper 
and a homemaker could turn out 
as interesting as its title suggests.

What really stands out in 

“Potluck Dinner Party” is not the 
celebrity bake-off, but rather 
the interactions between the 
hosts and their respective guest 
stars. Not only do the guest stars 
provide a medium through which 
Snoop and Martha get into an 
off-the-teleprompter groove, but 
they also throw in some hilarious 
anecdotes throughout the show’s 
40 minute run time. The first 
episode itself is titled “Putting the 
Pot in Potluck,” which resonates 
well with Rogen, who jokingly 
brings a fire extinguisher onstage 
that is not intended for a cooking 
fire. The talk of the night is pot, 
and given some of the users 
onstage, you can only guess the 
shenanigans that ensue. So as 
the night rolls on and the drinks 
multiply, the quartet takes their 
food to a game of “Two Thighs 
and a Truth,” a play on the 
popular game “Two Lies and a 
Truth,” as Ice Cube judges their 
cooking masterpieces. Through 
the 
impromptu 
interactions 

which display a lightheartedness 
and genuine fun between the duo 
there is a shimmer of a hope that 
this eccentric cooking series has 
a shot at success in the coming 
episodes.

When 
Rostam 
Batmanglij 

announced his departure from 
indie staple Vampire Weekend, 
the 
community 

lamented. Many 
fans 
still 
do, 

but 
Rostam’s 

recent 
work 

with 
Hamilton 

Leithauser 
(former 
vocalist 

for The Walkmen) 
should 
put 
to 

rest any doubts 
about his future 
involvement 
in 

music and the quality of his work 
separate from Vampire Weekend. 
Now, with Leithauser, Rostam’s 
work sounds more traditional, 
inspired by oldies while remaining 
distinctly baroque in nature. On 
I Had A Dream That You Were 
Mine, the duo’s debut, plainly but 
carefully arranged piano, (slide) 
guitar, bass, exuberant percussion 
and the occasional organ provide 
a 
backdrop 
for 
Hamilton’s 

intrinsically emotive rasp.

Although the album recalls the 

work of American songwriters of 
old — Dylan and Cohen, especially 
— Hamilton and Rostam seem 
focused on not simply rehashing 
what has already been done 
so many times before. “Rough 
Going (I Won’t Let Up),” with it’s 
unashamed “sha-doobie sha-doo-
wop” backing, is perhaps the most 
immediate indication of the duo’s 
deeply unironic love for the gaudier 
music of North America’s past. 
“You Ain’t That Young Kid” echoes 
this love, with a classic harmonica-
and-piano opening, but exemplifies 
Hamilton and Rostam’s more 
modern approach. The song starts 
on harmonica, but transitions to a 
swinging slide guitar, then changes 

pace completely with a rolling, 
bass-driven melody and closes 
shortly after a brief harpsichord 
line, evidencing the pair’s musical 
comfort with the genre and its 
associated conventions.

As tends to be the trend with 

albums 
whose 

instrumentation 
invokes nostalgia, 
the lyrics follow 
suit. 
Focusing 

primarily on past 
relationships 
and wishes for 
what could have 
been, could be or 
might one day be, 
Hamilton’s vocals 
are appropriately 

melancholic. 
They 
provide 
a 

good balance for their relatively 
jubilant backing while skillfully 
avoiding the wallowing feeling 
often associated with nostalgia.

On 
“The 
Morning 
Stars” 

— a rambling, percussive ode 
to a past lover — Hamilton is 
the metaphorical ghost of his 
relationship, 
wondering 
who 

could possibly have replaced him. 
It is followed by “1959,” in which 
Hamilton sings of his mistakes 
in a relationship, reminiscing 
on inside jokes and reflecting 
on mortality, while coming to 
terms with his baser tendencies. 
The track also features Angel 
Deradoorian (formerly of Dirty 
Projectors), 
the 
sole 
guest 

appearance on the album.

Emotionally charged standout 

“The Bride’s Dad” is the brief 
narrative of a deadbeat, unkempt 
father singing at his daughter’s 
wedding. Nostalgia remains the 
dominating tone, but in a more 
playful sense than a sorrowful one 
here. The wedding guests are a 
mix of amused and uncomfortable 
as he’s escorted, crying, from the 
stage, but all he cares is that “(he) 
caught (his daughter) smile / From 

the corner of (his) eye.”

Songs like leading single “A 

1000 Times” and “In a Black 
Out” will draw listeners in with 
their straightforward poppiness 
and anthemic qualities, but the 
appeal of these two decreases 
with time. In “A 1000 Times,” a 
man wanders the streets of the 
city — New York? — and finds 
himself accidentally in front of 
an old lover’s house that has now 
been boarded up. The song is a 
rousing call, a passionate cry into 
the dark, but teeters on the edge 
of being repetitive. Meanwhile, 
“In a Black Out,” which is more or 
less the paragon of accessibility in 
a song — it was recently featured 
in a television ad for Apple, if that 
helps give you an idea —simply 
sticks out stylistically from the 
rest of the album. It sounds more 
like it was written to serve as proof 
that the duo knows how to craft an 
immediate earworm, while they 
would, on the whole, really rather 
not.

When all’s said and done, 

Hamilton and Rostam make a 
formidable pair. Hamilton’s voice 
— breaking, bending and soaring 
over Rostam’s straightforward 
piano 
— 
ensures 
that 
the 

sometimes cliché tropes employed 
still come across as genuine. The 
pair cover an impressive amount 
of ground, sonically speaking, and 
it is not difficult to imagine nearly 
any song on the album faring well 
as a single.

At the very least, I Had A 

Dream is an exciting new step for 
both Hamilton and Rostam, and 
one that should reassure fans of 
both artists’s previous and solo 
work. The album functions well 
as an anchor for the duo, a starting 
point that recalls both Vampire 
Weekend and The Walkmen while 
also establishing this new project 
and wiping clean the slate of 
stylistic expectations.

HELP WANTED

T

wo weeks ago, when I 
had to choose a poem 
to memorize and recite 

for an English class, I chose W. 
H. Auden’s “Stop all the clocks” 
because I thought it was beautiful. 
It captured the frustrated grief I 
had felt after breakups and other 
mundane tragedies.

When I had to 

recite the poem in 
class on Nov. 9, it 
captured something 
similar, 
but 
much 

more 
intense. 

Tuesday night was 
really hard for me. 
Watching the election 
play out on CNN 
felt 
like 
someone 

was telling me that 
everyone who had 
told me I could do anything was 
lying. As a white woman, I know it 
was exponentially more difficult 
for many others. A crushing 
sadness and a mobilizing anger 
were fighting for space in my 
brain.

The poem captured something 

that I was struggling to put into 
words. It was anger at the world 
for continuing to go on and be 
a thing of beauty despite the 
ugliness of its inhabitants. I’ve 
never wanted to “pack up the 
moon and dismantle the sun” 
more than I did when I woke 
up on Wednesday morning to 
brilliant sunshine, golden trees 
and a cloudless sky.

On my walk to class I put on 

LCD Soundsystem’s “Someone 
Great” in search of some joy and 
a eulogy to the president that 
could have been. And then James 
Murphy sang: “The worst is all 
the lovely weather / I’m stunned, 
it’s not raining.” And I felt it 
again: anger at the audacity of 
beauty and guilt for taking time to 
indulge in it.

Art felt trivial. It felt small 

and unimportant against the 
nightmare that was unfolding 
around me. How can I go to the 
movies when people are painting 
swastikas on storefronts? What 

album do I listen to while a girl 
on my campus is forced to remove 
her hijab? How can beauty live 
among so much ugliness? Is it fair 
to make time for it?

I wanted to “cut off the 

telephone.” I wanted a moment 
of complete silence and stillness. 

But the world does 
not wait for a broken 
heart.

But 
then, 
on 

Friday, 
I 
saw 

“Moonlight” — and 
I encourage you all 
to do the same. Not 
only 
because 
it’s 

the best movie I’ve 
seen (and probably 
will see) this year. 
But 
because 
the 

experience of seeing 

a beautiful movie in a theater 
full of people was the most 
reaffirming experience I’ve had 
since last Tuesday.

It was the most diverse crowd 

— in terms of race, age and gender 
— that I’ve ever been in at the 
Michigan Theater. It was also the 
largest crowd I’ve seen there. It 
felt good to sit next to someone 
I didn’t know. It felt good to be 
forced to be in community with 
people I did not know. It felt good 
to know that we could be brought 
together through art.

“Moonlight” would have been 

breathtaking on any day of any 
year. But on the Friday after the 
2016 election, it was even more 
so. Because it told the story 
— with beauty, honesty and 
humanity — of the exact type 
of person who does not belong 
in “Trump’s America.” A poor, 
gay Black man. No one in the 
movie fit Trump’s definition of 
beautiful.

Film is, at its best (and it’s often 

not at its best), a vessel for voices 
that are not easily heard. I’m 
sure that in the coming months 
and years many more voices will 
be silenced. That’s all the more 
reason to use art as a microphone 
for the silenced.

It takes a thousand — maybe 

even a million — voices to create 
change. And what I’m realizing 
is that those voices don’t need to 
speak through the same medium. 
We need filmmakers and singers 
and politicians and poets and 
scientists.

I still don’t know what to do or 

what I should do. Part of me still 
feels an odd guilt about the time 
I spend consuming rather than 
creating, watching rather than 
fighting.

But what our country seems 

to be in desperate need of is a big 
dose of empathy. And I can’t think 
of a better syringe to deliver that 
than art. Nothing forces you to 
inhabit the headspace of another 
human the way art does. In some 
ways, art is the closest we ever 
get to really understanding each 
other.

I think we still have an 

obligation to make and consume 
art. But that can’t be it anymore. 
You can’t just fight and you can’t 
just go to the movies. Those two 
things are going to have to find 
a way to shape and spark each 
other. Art has the power to ignite 
change, but only if we make art 
that wants to ignite change and 
consume art that wants to change 
us.

This is how empathy and 

giving voice to the voiceless meet 
each other. It’s going to become 
more and more important (and it’s 
already pretty damn important) 
to read books, watch movies and 
listen to music created by people 
that are not like me — that do not 
look like me or think like me.

Togetherness 
begins 
with 

empathy and I believe that all the 
parenting magazine thinkpieces 
are right when they say art is one 
of the best (if not only) ways to 
teach empathy.

So get angry. And then make 

something beautiful out of that 
anger. Teach something, learn 
something. The time to “silence 
the piano” has not yet come.

MADELEINE 

GAUDIN 

ROLLING STONES RECORDS

The cast of ‘The Walking Dead.’

Few bands captivate the soul 

of rock ‘n’ roll like The Rolling 
Stones do. For over half a century, 
they’ve been playing their tunes 
to millions of fans 
across the globe. 
On March 25, The 
Rolling 
Stones 

made music history 
by being the first 
international band 
to 
perform 
in 

Havana, the capital 
of Cuba, since the 
United States first 
lifted its embargo sanctions on 
the country, marking a cultural 
milestone in bringing large-scale 
performances back to the people 
of Cuba. The Rolling Stones felt 
the show was so important that 
they recorded yet another live 
album and film to add to their 
repertoire — an already massive 
list of 12 — with impressive sonic 
flair, but lackluster filler for what’s 
expected of a live album.

With a length of two hours, 

Havana Moon is truly only for the 
most diehard fans without the 
accompanying video recording 
of the performance. Banter is 

kept to a minimum, and when it 
is included, it’s almost entirely 
spoken in Spanish, remaining true 
to the language of the country 
hosting the band. My minimal 
skills with the Spanish language 
created a hiccup in the personal 
connection that’s typically created 

by the banter in a 
live album, one I’m 
sure is felt by many 
attempting to enjoy 
the album to its 
fullest. 

Despite 
the 

disconnected 
banter for English 
speakers, the music 
itself remains true 

to the spiritedness of rock ‘n’ roll, 
the unflinching desire to bang 
your head and sing along. At 73, 
it’s pretty damn incredible that 
Mick Jagger doesn’t fall flat in 
performance. With classics like 
“Jumpin’ Jack Flash,” “Honky 
Tonk Woman” and “You Can’t 
Always Get What You Want,” the 
setlist was primed for the essential 
electricity 
and 
nostalgia 
that 

Jagger delivers on all fronts.

A particularly well executed 

moment in the set is the transition 
from “Angie” to “Paint It Black.” 
The move from a light-hearted 
anthem to the dynamic guitar 

hooks of the iconic song perfectly 
display why The Rolling Stones 
have remained relevant all these 
years. They deliver what fans of 
rock ‘n’ roll want and need out of 
a concert, while maintaining the 
stage presence necessary to satisfy 
thousands of fans per show.

Outside of the music itself, 

Havana Moon offers little for a live 
album, and considering its length, 
it 
becomes 
an 
unnecessarily 

winded 18-track Stones playlist 
due to the cheering in between 
each song. It’s understandable 
that The Rolling Stones wanted to 
capture the historic concert, but 
as a standalone album without the 
visual performance, it simply lacks 
any compelling reason to pay much 
attention to it.

Havana Moon does a great job 

capturing the sonic energy of a 
Rolling Stones performance, but it 
lacks a reason for existence outside 
of being a soundtrack to the DVD 
recording. It’s just more efficient to 
copy the setlist onto a playlist than 
sit through two hours of an album 
with minimal additions to the flair 
that accompanies a rock ‘n’ roll 
concert. The historic prevalence 
has natural importance, but other 
than this context, Havana Moon 
lacks many facets that can make a 
live album great.

Stones are boring on ‘Havana Moon’

Live album from Cuba offers little for the English-speaking listener

At the end of what felt like 

a bleak week for many, “SNL” 
provided its usual comedic relief 
with a dramatically different tone. 
 

This week’s show, hosted by 

Dave Chappelle (“The Chappelle 
Show”) took an 
inevitably more 
serious 
note 

in 
the 
wake 

of what was a 
shocking 
and 

devastating 
election result 
for many. Both 
the show and 
Chappelle 
took 
the 

opportunity 
to 
express 
a 

hopeful sentiment regarding the 
country’s future and pause for 
reflection about how the nation 
got to where it is now. The cold 
open was scrapped in favor of 
a heartfelt rendition of the late 
Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah,” 
performed by Kate McKinnon 
(“Ghostbusters”) 
dressed 
as 

Hillary Clinton. Rather than 
parodying Clinton as she usually 
does, McKinnon embodied her 
spirit and quoted her concession 
speech, “I’m not going to give 
up, and neither should you” in an 
appropriately poignant opening.

Despite this message of hope, 

the show went on to mock the 
election results and the country’s 
responses to it with its trademark 
satire, some unexpected new 
sketch formats and Chappelle 
at the helm. With an edge of 
cynicism, 
the 
first-time 
host 

discussed the week’s events in his 
opening monologue, touching on 
the Black Lives Matter movement 
and pointing to President-elect 
Donald Trump’s most grating 
flaws.

However, Chappelle may have 

surprised audiences by claiming 
he himself wasn’t surprised by 
the election results, stating “You 
know, I didn’t know that Donald 
Trump was going to win the 
election. I did suspect it. It seemed 

like Hillary was doing well in the 
polls and yet — I know the whites. 
You guys aren’t as full of surprises 
as you used to be.”

Following up his response to 

the election, Chappelle reminded 
audiences that other important 
issues still deserve our attention. 
In the best line of his opening 
monologue, 
Chappelle 
jokes, 

“Why do we have 
to say that Black 
lives matter? Now 
I admit that is not 
the 
best 
slogan, 

but 
McDonald’s 

already 
took, 

‘You 
deserve 
a 

break 
today.’ 
” 

Chappelle’s candid 
humor and ability 
to 
deliver 
frank 

comedy that gets the point across 
makes his monologue a linchpin of 
this week’s show.

Though 
his 
monologue 

perfectly 
encapsulates 
the 

sentiment following the election 
with practiced humor, he also 
appeals to audiences with a 
more serious undertone in a 
mic-dropping line, “I’m going 
to give Donald Trump a chance 
and I hope that he’ll give us, the 
historically disenfranchised, a 
chance too.”

This 
powerful 
opening 

monologue perfectly transitions 
into the first and funniest sketch 
of the evening — poking fun at 
liberals who were dumbfounded 
by Trump’s upset victory on 
election night. Chappelle plays 
the skeptical attendee deriding 
the 
others’ 
confidence 
in 

Hillary’s prospects. Audience 
members may have heard many 
of the lines they themselves 
uttered during election night, 
which turned frantic as Trump 
claimed more and more electoral 
college votes. But the overall 
message delivered in this honest 
depiction was that people who 
were confident in the results 
were blinded by the drastic 
partisan gap that determined the 
election. Chris Rock (“Grown 
Ups”) even made an appearance 
supporting this, bursting into 

laughter 
alongside 
Chappelle 

when SNL cast member Beck 
Bennett sadly notes, “This is the 
most shameful thing America 
has ever done.” Their laughter 
says it all.

Colin Jost and Michael Che 

tackle the election on “Weekend 
Update,” with Jost comparing 
Trump’s presidency to the plot of 
“The Intern,” and a barely second-
long sequence listing the names 
of the record-breaking number 
of 
female 
minorities 
elected 

to the Senate set to the tune of 
Rachel Platten’s “Fight Song.” 
The song barely finishes the first 
line of lyrics before the clip ends. 
Though the nature of the segment 
is mostly to blame for an excessive 
amount of election material, most 
of it falls flat (especially following 
Chappelle’s monologue and the 
first sketch). However, Jost and 
Che pull through with some 
amusing lines and are ultimately 
saved 
by 
McKinnon’s 
best 

appearance as Supreme Court 
justice 
Ruth 
Bader 
Ginsburg 

appearance 
yet. 
McKinnon 

downs a huge bag of Emergen-C 
and claims she has “horcruxes” 
hidden, refusing to let her old age 
get in the way of her job now that 
Trump’s president.

Having addressed just about 

every aspect of the election 
throughout 
the 
show, 
“SNL” 

turns to analyzing itself. Though 
not one of the strongest sketches, 
“Inside 
SNL” 
is 
delightfully 

surprising in contrast to the 
cynical tone taken by most of the 
previous coverage of the election. 
Cleverly using the post-game 
analysis format, “Inside SNL” 
takes a look at what doesn’t work 
in a sketch, with members of the 
cast delivering cliché lines about 
their performance. The smart 
framing and pure silliness of the 
sketch makes it a refreshing break 
from all the political satire.

Despite one of the toughest 

weeks the United States has had 
in recent history, “SNL” pulls 
through with a standout episode, 
reassuring audiences that it will 
be there to make us laugh as 
always.

Chesson seeks breakthrough to boost ‘M’

A year ago, Jehu Chesson was 

most commonly seen wide open, 
awaiting a pass that he would 
probably turn into a touchdown.

Chesson’s 
redshirt 
junior 

season underwent a second-half 
breakout that saw him climb 
into the conversation as one of 
the Big Ten’s best receivers and 
even threw his name into NFL 
draft consideration toward the 
end of last season. And then 
came the injury.

Playing against Florida in the 

Citrus Bowl, Chesson sustained 
a leg injury and had to go on 
crutches. He wasn’t medically 
cleared until just before fall 
camp, forcing him to miss out on 
nearly the entire offseason.

In the time since his return, 

he hasn’t made the same impact 
he did late in 2015. He has just 
two receiving touchdowns and 
is averaging 44.6 yards per 
game, a significant drop-off for 
a player who caught over 110 
yards in three of Michigan’s 
last four games last season. But 
when asked about the drop-off 
on Tuesday, Chesson declined 
to blame the injury for his 
decreased production.

“I felt normal going into 

camp,” he said.

In 
the 
Wolverines’ 
14-13 

loss against Iowa on Saturday, 
Chesson was held in check for 
just two catches for 30 yards. On 
one crucial play late in the game, 
he appeared to have a chance to 
haul in a critical first down, but 
instead the ball was pulled away 
by Iowa’s Manny Rugamba.

The first down alone would 

not have been enough to give 
Michigan the win on its own, but 
it would have put the Wolverines 
in field-goal range with a full 
set of downs. Tuesday, Chesson 
took responsibility for the play.

“I let the guys down on that 

one,” he said. “Something I’ll 

learn from, and we just gotta 
keep pushing. Obviously you’ve 
gotta use your hands, regardless 
of where the ball is, the 
expectation is to make that play. 
We need that play so badly.”

One factor that could provide 

Chesson a spark is a potential 
change at quarterback. Multiple 
outlets reported Monday that 
Wilton Speight would miss the 
remainder of the regular season 
with 
a 
broken 
collarbone, 

though Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh denied those reports.

He did admit, though, that 

Speight was injured, so there 
is a possibility Michigan could 
switch to redshirt junior John 
O’Korn under center.

Speight seemed to develop a 

rapport with fifth-year senior 
receiver Amara Darboh, who 
became 
the 
quarterback’s 

go-to target on deep balls. But 
Chesson, who filled that role 
for Jake Rudock last season, is 
still very much a threat in the 
passing game. It’s possible he 
will find chemistry with O’Korn 
should Michigan call on the 
backup, which could signal an 
increase in targets for Chesson.

Against Maryland, Chesson 

played his most productive 
game of the season, pulling 
down five catches for 112 
yards and a touchdown. After 
that performance, Harbaugh 
was quick to say there was no 

special mandate to target the 
fifth-year senior.

“It wasn’t a plan to feed Jehu, 

but it’s been a really interesting 
dynamic,” 
Harbaugh 
said. 

“I would say this. Here’s the 
greatest share of it, really, is I 
thought there were times last 
year where Jehu was playing 
great. 
Amara 
became 
the 

beneficiary of that in games 
last year, and then Amara 
would have a big game, so 
it’s probably no coincidence. 
Amara’s been doing some great 
things — last week had a big 
game, 11-catch game, over 100 
yards — and then Jehu becomes 
the beneficiary of that.”

Now, though, with a new 

quarterback in the huddle, the 
target distribution could change 
once again. Chesson has long 
been expected to break through, 
and perhaps O’Korn could use 
his playmaking ability in the 
event Speight can’t go.

But, at least publicly, he says 

he won’t go into the game with 
any specific goal of upping his 
game to help O’Korn.

“Once you start thinking 

about it as playing up to 
something, then what were you 
doing when you weren’t playing 
up to that?” Chesson said. “I 
don’t 
personally 
have 
that 

mindset because I want to play 
at a level that I can be consistent, 
through and through.”

Fifth-year senior wide receiver Jehu Chesson had an impressive game against Maryland on Nov. 5, but he’s still looking to replicate his numbers from last season.

Evans, freshmen move forward after defeat

After the Michigan football 

team lost to Iowa over the 
weekend, 
senior 
running 

back De’Veon Smith told his 
teammates that they needed that 
loss, and they could learn from it. 
He felt the Wolverines had gotten 
too comfortable, and in order to 
move forward, they would have 
to focus more in practice.

Freshman 
running 
back 

Chris Evans listened to his older 
teammate. For the freshmen on 
the team, the loss at Kinnick 
Stadium was their first-ever 
taste of defeat.

“Yeah, I was surprised (by 

how the loss felt),” Evans said. 
“When they ran on the field, I 
was like, ‘Oh my goodness,’ like 
this is some crazy stuff. It was 
ridiculous.”

He went on to describe the 

Hawkeye fans storming the field 
as “like a movie.”

The loss didn’t feel real until 

hours later, when Michigan was 
waiting for its plane to take off 
on the tarmac.

“As I was sitting there, I’m 

like, ‘Dang, we just really lost,’ ” 
Evans said. “And then it popped 
up on the TVs behind the seats, 
a recap of it and stuff, so that 
really hit hard.”

The freshmen on the squad 

have their own group chat, and 
when it sank in that the team 
would no longer be undefeated 
for the first time in their short 
careers, emotions flared.

“We could tell how people 

switched, like changed, because 
we haven’t really been in that 
situation,” Evans said. “So we 
saw really people’s true colors 
after they got mad, and their 
anger built up and stuff. We’re 

just talking, like we just gotta 
make sure we keep our heads on 
straight when it’s our time.”

In a way, the freshmen have 

been spoiled by Michigan’s 
success. At the same time, the 
rookies have contributed to this 
season and have ownership for 
its success just as much as some 
of the veterans do.

Evans was the leading rusher 

against Iowa, and defensive end 
Rashan Gary, offensive lineman 
Ben Bredeson and wide receiver 
Eddie McDoom all played major 
roles in their units as well.

Despite 
Evans’ 
relative 

success against Iowa, rushing 

eight times for 52 yards, he was 
still upset with his performance.

“I feel like I would get through 

the gap,” Evans 
said. “But I was 
getting down on 
myself because 
I feel like the 
offense, 
we 

really needed a 
big play, but I felt 
like I couldn’t do 
that for us.”

The freshmen 

reaction 
to 

the 
loss 
was 

somewhat expected. But older 
teammates have been there 

before, and some are even 
impressed with the way they’re 
handling it. Those who have 

experienced 
losses 
before 

agree 
that 

perhaps 
an 

initial exposure 
to it could be 
positive.

“I 
think 

they’re all fired 
up and ready to 
attack this week 
of 
practice,” 

said 
redshirt 

sophomore 
tight 
end 
Ian 

Bunting. “We have a very mature 

group of freshmen and a lot of 
guys that are playing. That was 
a big learning experience for 
them I think, and for everyone 
on the team.”

For someone like Evans, who 

this summer plastered to his 
ceiling magazine articles that 
wrote him off as an instant 
redshirt, the loss stung. After 
overcoming criticism that he 
wouldn’t be able to contribute 
in 2016, this was his first major 
defeat.

Against 
Indiana, 
the 

Wolverines will get to see for the 
first time how their freshmen 
rebound.

Young running back was shocked by last-second loss, vows to ‘make sure we keep our heads straight’

MARINA ROSS/Daily

Freshman running back Chris Evans led Michigan with 52 rushing yards Saturday, but he also suffered the first loss of his career at Michigan.

“When they 

ran on the field, 
I was like, ‘Oh 
my goodness.’ ”

Martin gains confidence 
as penalty-kill specialist

With his team on the penalty 

kill and the score level in 
the third period of Saturday 
night’s game against No. 4 
Boston University, Michigan 
hockey coach Red Berenson 
put defenseman Luke Martin 
on the ice. Martin, known for 
his physical blocking style, was 
tasked with maintaining the 1-1 
score for two minutes while the 
18th-ranked Wolverines played 
with a one-man disadvantage.

Once the power play began, 

two Boston University players 
took shots that went just wide 
before forward Kieffer Bellows 
recovered the puck for one more 
opportunity. Bellows slapped a 
shot hoping for a go-ahead goal, 
but Martin’s 6-foot-3 frame 
deflected it and the puck sailed 
away. Bellows had another 
chance, but Michigan freshman 
goaltender 
Jack 
LaFontaine 

saved it.

It was Martin’s fifth block of 

the game and his 25th on the 
season, both team highs.

“I think it’s something he’s 

learned before he got here, 
and 
now 
he 
realizes 
how 

important it is here, too, to be 
able to block shots,” Berenson 
said Monday. “He’s got a smart 
stick. He reaches with his stick 
defensively. He’s good and is 
learning how to play physical at 
this level. He uses his strength 
and his size, and it’s all part of 
development.”

Added Martin: “(There’s) not 

that much technique. It’s about 
having the will to get in front of 
it. I think at the end of the day, I 
(block shots) so when I get back 
to the bench everyone’s going to 
give me a pat on the back.”

As the youngest player on 

a youthful Michigan team, 
Martin 
experienced 
some 

nervousness 
early 
in 
the 

season. Berenson believes that 
Martin’s experience with the 
United States National Team 
Development Program last year 
gives the freshman momentum 
and confidence to play in rowdy 
college arenas all over the 
country, just as he did last year.

To help ease this transition, 

on all road trips, freshmen 
room 
with 
upperclassmen. 

For the team’s trips to the 
East Coast and Arizona State, 
Martin has stayed with junior 
defenseman Sam Piazza, whom 
he credits with easing his 
early-season jitters.

“(Piazza’s) a very calming 

influence,” 
Martin 
said. 

“Especially for our first couple 
away games I was getting a 
little nervous, and I think he 
could tell. He was very good at 
calming me down. He reminded 
me to trust myself and trust my 
game. Obviously, he’s a very 
calm player so that carried over, 
and it was a huge help.”

Added Berenson: “A veteran 

player can help the young 
player, he can just remind him 
of whether it’s our systems, 
or what we do in this case, or 
what we do in that case, or in 
that situation. It’s just so (the 
freshmen) 
have 
somebody 

experienced with them, to show 
them that they’re playing the 
right way. If you get two young 
guys together, and especially if 
one of them gets rattled, they 
don’t have an older player to 
settle them down and give them 
some leadership.”

While many of Michigan’s 

wingers 
from 
last 
season 

graduated or left for the NHL, 
many of its defensive mainstays 
remain in Ann Arbor. As a 

result, 
Berenson 
pairs 
his 

younger players with veterans 
on the ice, especially early in 
the season. Through his first 10 
games, Martin has played with 
Piazza, senior Nolan De Jong 
and senior Kevin Lohan. Martin 
calls it “a treat” to play with 
these veterans and believes 
each of them bring different 
aspects to assist Martin as he 
grows as a player.

Last 
Friday 
night, 
the 

Wolverines scored two power-
play goals within one minute. 
The second was aided by Martin, 
who 
Berenson 
terms 
“the 

quarterback” of the power play.

“When I’m up top, I keep it 

simple,” Martin said. “I don’t 
really try to overcomplicate 
things. I’m good at getting 
shots through to the net, which 
generates offense. The guys on 
my flanks and in the middle, 
they complement me and they 
cover me when I make mistakes 
real well.”

Martin is the only freshman 

defenseman to have played in 
every game thus far, a testament 
to the confidence that Berenson 
has in him. Martin looks to 
improve as the season marches 
forward, displaying strength in 
shot blocking and for having the 
knack of being at the right place 
at the right time — he leads the 
Wolverines in plus/minus with 
a whopping plus-eight.

“I 
think 
he’s 
making 

progress,” 
Berenson 
said. 

“I think he’s getting more 
confidence, getting experience. I 
think he’s learning what it takes 
to play well at this level. I think 
(defenseman) is the hardest 
position to come in and play as a 
freshman because you’re playing 
against really good forwards on 
other teams and I think he’s 
holding his own so far.”

Donnal puts name back in 
discussion at starting ‘5’

In the week leading up to 

the Michigan men’s basketball 
team’s exhibition opener against 
Armstrong State, Moritz Wagner 
could sense that his role on the 
team was changing.

Coach John Beilein began to 

have the sophomore forward join 
the first unit during practice, but 
Wagner still didn’t know if he 
would crack the starting five. It 
wasn’t until the day before the 
game that Wagner found out for 
certain when Beilein told him. 

With 15 points on 7-for-9 

shooting — tied with senior 
forward Zak Irvin for the 
highest output of the night — 
Wagner stole the show. In 25 
minutes on the floor, fewer than 
only Irvin and senior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr., he justified 
Beilein’s decision to start him 
over 
redshirt 
junior 
Mark 

Donnal, one of the breakout 
players from a season ago.

“You see the way he runs 

the floor. You saw his skill 
level a couple of times, too. His 
development is huge,” Beilein 
said. “… His defense is much 
better, and he stayed out of foul 
trouble. The big thing is we think 
he can take a lot of guys his size 
off the bounce.”

The 
competition 
for 
the 

‘5’ spot in the starting lineup 
between the two big men, which 
has been brewing throughout 
the summer and fall, looked all 
but settled. Wagner emerged 
with the edge over his more 
experienced counterpart, and 
the discussion seemed to be over.

Until last weekend, that is.
Against Howard and IUPUI in 

the first two games of the regular 
season, Donnal showed up in 
a big way for the Wolverines. 
Providing a spark off the bench 

that Michigan sorely needed 
at certain sluggish moments, 
Donnal proved that he could still 
be a difference-maker, rather 
than an afterthought.

In Friday’s matchup versus 

the Bison, Donnal played nearly 
10 more minutes than Wagner — 
despite being his backup — and 
made the most of the increased 
floor time. He finished with 12 
points and six rebounds, the 
team’s second-highest total in 
each category on the night. Walton 
beat him out with 20 points, and 
redshirt junior DJ Wilson topped 
him with eight boards.

The bench duo of Donnal and 

Wilson combined for 21 points 
and 14 rebounds and helped 
the Wolverines snap out of an 
early funk, in which they simply 
couldn’t score for the first five 
minutes of the game. As the 
sixth and seventh men in the 
lineup, the pair gave Michigan 
the boost it needed to secure a 
76-58 win.

“That’s our job, to be energy 

guys off the bench,” Donnal 
said. “What we’re trying to bring 
every game is energy (to) pick 
up the guys on the starting five 
and not have a drop-off when the 
bench comes on the floor.”

In Sunday’s game against 

the Jaguars, Donnal’s numbers 
on offense fell to eight points 
and 
three 
boards, 
but 
his 

contributions mattered most on 
the defensive side of the ball.

IUPUI 
put 
up 
a 
strong 

challenge in the first half, 
maintaining 
a 
considerable 

lead 
while 
the 
Wolverines 

attempted to whittle away at 
the deficit. Though Michigan 
finally took the lead with seven 
minutes left, it gave it right 
back and the Jaguars held onto 
a 32-30 advantage with four 
minutes 
remaining. 
That’s 

when Beilein decided to put 

Donnal in the game. 

The move worked wonders, 

as Donnal’s presence shored 
up the defense and helped the 
Wolverines hold their own in 
the face of the offensive barrage 
of the Jaguars. Michigan held 
IUPUI scoreless to close the 
opening half, launching a 13-0 
run to enter halftime with a 
43-32 advantage that it wouldn’t 
relinquish.

“When 
Mark 
went 
into 

the game, it changed things 
defensively. He can plug gaps,” 
Beilein said. “(Wagner) is still 
trying to learn where he should 
be sometimes. He’s guessing 
sometimes, and the game needs 
to slow down for him in ball 
screen coverage. … When they 
see a center trying to figure 
things out, they just attack the 
big guy. Mark plugged that up, 
and that was a big difference.”

Just like that, the competition 

is back on.

Beilein may not have officially 

reopened it, and he kept Wagner 
as the starter so far, but he also 
seems to have an open mind 
about the topic. He may stick 
with his decision, but after two 
standout performances, Donnal 
might have changed his mind.

“That’s what we have to sort 

out is what’s the best lineup 
really for every game,” Beilein 
said. 
“There’s 
some 
hard-

charging teams in the Big Ten. … 
Mark can plug and do some great 
things — not going to jump out 
of the gym. He just needs to be 
there and be strong going after 
the ball. I’m proud of the way 
he’s played so far; it’s two good 
games back to back.”

While Beilein’s choice may 

change on a nightly basis, what 
won’t is that if Donnal can 
maintain the level of production 
he has exhibited off the bench 
thus far, he will find the floor.

Flaherty, Gondrezick star in wins, 
earn weekly conference accolades

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team sits in the shadow 
of Big Ten foes, No. 6 Maryland and 
No. 7 Ohio State, but it is making 
a case for more recognition in 
the conference. The Wolverines 
trounced Oakland, 101-63, on 
Friday night, and followed that 
impressive 
performance 
with 

a 107-35 blowout over Niagara 
on Sunday afternoon in the first 
weekend of regular-season play.

Two 
Michigan 
players, 

junior guard Katelynn Flaherty 
and 
freshman 
guard 
Kysre 

Gondrezick, were honored by the 
Big Ten after their performances 
over the weekend.

Flaherty earned her spot on 

the Big Ten Player of the Week 
honor roll through consistent goal 
scoring, leading the team in both 
games. She racked up 23 points 
against the Golden Grizzlies, and 
she tallied 14 more against the 
Purple Eagles in just 17 minutes of 
action to become the 10th player 
in Michigan history to score 1,300 
career points.

“I think our whole team 

came out with a little butterflies 
(against Oakland),” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico. “And in 
the first half, we didn’t shoot the 
ball exceptionally well. But then 
Katelynn got hot in the second 
half, and for her, the difference 
is she’s facing every team’s best 
defender from the start.”

When the rest of the Wolverines 

— especially Gondrezick, who 
was playing in her first collegiate 
game — got rid of their first-game 
butterflies, they provided enough 
of a distraction that Flaherty was 
left with plenty of time to get her 
shots off. Gondrezick, who was 
named the Big Ten Freshman of 
the Week, came off the bench and 
scored 19 points in just 18 minutes 
against 
Oakland, 
effectively 

drawing some of the Golden 
Grizzlies’ defenders off of Flaherty.

The week before, Gondrezick 

was the only freshman to get 
significant playing time in the 
Wolverines’ 
exhibition 
game 

against Wayne State, but she 
was not able to land any of her 
attempts to score her first points.

“I’m glad I got (the exhibition 

game) 
underneath 
my 
belt,” 

Gondrezick said. “Just being in 
front of the Michigan crowd for 
the first time and playing on that 
floor was so surreal for me. I think 
I approached the game too fast. I 
didn’t let it come to me.”

Gondrezick 
proved 
her 

exhibition debut to be a fluke 
when it counted, though. Over the 
weekend, she quickly became the 
Wolverines’ second-leading scorer 
behind Flaherty with 31 points over 
two games. She has also contributed 
a team-high nine assists.

Her solid play paved the way 

for the rest of the freshman class 
to get off the bench. Freshmen 
guard Kayla Robbins, forward 
KeAsja Peace, and guard Akienreh 
Johnson all contributed their first 
collegiate points on Sunday, with 
12, four and eight, respectively.

“(Gondrezick’s) a basketball 

player,” Barnes Arico said. “She 
really has a great understanding 
of the game. She led our team 
in assists the other day. She can 
score the ball, she can rebound 
the basketball, but she’s gotta 
continue to get better. She’s going 
to have some bumps in the road, 
but she’s got a chance to be a 
special player for us.”

Added Gondrezick: “Scoring-

wise, I just have a knack for putting 
the ball in the basket, but my focus 
right now is impacting the team 
through other facets of my game, 
whether that’s dropping dimes, or 
rebounding, or collapsing on the 
defensive end and getting steals.”

With Flaherty to look up to, 

there’s no reason to believe that 
Gondrezick will not have an 
impactful presence for Michigan. 
If both players can manage to 
remain 
consistent, 
opposing 

teams will have a quite a pair to 
defend against.

MICHIGAN IN COLOR
an inclusive space by and for people of color

in collaboration with


T

he summer between my freshman and sophomore 
years, my family housed our first exchange student. 
At the time, Caro, a bubbly soccer player with an 

infectious smile, was a junior in high school from Bully, a 
small French city. She came to Midland, Mich., where my 
family lives, through the Rotary Club Exchange, which 
provides high school students with the opportunity to spend 
a year abroad with three or four different host families to 
better understand local culture.

As British expats in the United States, my family provides 

a unique perspective for exchange students. The students 
come to the United States to learn the American way of life, 
but staying with a British family changes the experience. As 
Caro’s last family in her rotation, she was well accustomed 
to the American way of life by the time she moved in. Her 
English was basically fluent and she had a good group of 
friends at school. I was moving home from my first year in 
college, happy that I’d be coming home to something — or 
more like someone — new and exciting. The idea of having 
a new person living in our house was cool. I looked forward 
to the opportunity to interact with Caro and share with her 
my life experiences and opinions. Caro was someone 
else to hang out with, talk to and practice French with. 
I was excited to have the entire summer to get to know 
her.

As the months went by, Caro and I got close, and the 

experience became so much more. It slowly became 
more normal to see her hanging out at my house, and 
she became another person to hang out with when 
things at the house were slow. She told me about her life, 
I told her about mine and we got to know the nuances 
of each other’s cultures, backgrounds and families. I 
learned about the French school system, and how when 
Caro went back to France, she would have to take the 
bac, a standardized French exam that determines what 
you can study at college. I told her about college at the 
University of Michigan, where we can — and often do 
— change our majors and programs in a matter of days. 
We taught each other swear words in our respective 
languages and laughed about it like children for hours. 

We even planned times to visit each other in the future, or 
meet wherever in the world we may end up.

With all good things, Caro’s stay came to an end and 

it came the time to say goodbye. Even after a few short 
months, we had bonded and created a deep friendship. It 
made me sad to say goodbye to her, as I felt like she was 
becoming a part of our family. Though she was two years 
younger than me, she felt like a sister and someone I would 
see every morning, pouring cereal into her bowl or, after 
dinner, doing work at the kitchen table.

After Caro left, my sister, Maddy, departed for her trip to 

France. She was participating in the same program as Caro 
and would spend a year abroad in Rochefort, France. Having 
Caro stay with us was a good opportunity for Maddy to see 
cultural exchange from the other side. Maddy was 16 years 
old when she went abroad going, and going abroad during 
junior year of high school is frightening. She could see the 
different emotions Caro might go through, how Caro would 
adjust to our culture. And, luckily, Maddy and Caro got to 
meet up across the world in Caro’s hometown.

The house was lonely with my brother the only child left 

at home. I visited often to keep my mom company, as the 
house went from six people to three in only a few weeks. 
It wasn’t long until my parents made up their minds: We 
would have another exchange student as soon as possible.

When Maddy came back this last summer, a new exchange 

student shortly followed. This time: a 16-year-old German 
boy named Lukas. When I went home for Fall Break, I met 
him for the first time and we had the opportunity to hang 
out and get to know each other.

Though Lukas is in the same program Caro was in, the 

experience has been totally different for my family. As each 
person has different interests, motivations and aspirations, 
Lukas and Caro could not be more opposite. Lukas is a 
6-foot-7-inch analytical, musically talented performer 
and the perfect contender for our high school’s basketball 
team. Having never played basketball before, I found it 
comical that in the four days I was home, Lukas was outside 
practicing every day and learning a very stereotypical 
“American sport” to satisfy the Dow High coaches that saw 
a very, very tall kid join the school in September.

I am so thankful that my family hosts exchange students 
because I get this invaluable opportunity to be a big 
sister to someone new. Accepting a new person into your 
home, and your status quo, can be really difficult. When 
it goes right, the experience is so rewarding and fun. 
Saying goodbye to Caro was one of my saddest goodbyes, 
and I’m sure Lukas’ goodbye will be equally sad.

In the future, I encourage anyone and their families 

to host an exchange student because the experience is 
invaluable. It’s not like travelling to another country 
and experiencing the culture firsthand; rather, it’s 
watching someone else grow within your own culture. 
I saw Caro perfect her English, play for her high school 
soccer team and travel all over the country. Similarly, I 
see Lukas dedicating himself to basketball, playing in 
our high school band and even carving a pumpkin for 
the first time. It’s so fun to watch someone observe, ask 
questions and soak up everything you take for granted 
each day.

NOW MORE THAN EVER: 

10 student leaders put the conversation about progress in context

V

ery soon after enrolling at this campus, the illusion of 
inclusivity was shattered for me. Throughout the years 

this has become clearer, as time and time again I have watched 
Islamophobia being ignored at the University of Michigan and 
throughout the country. At the end of my freshman year, I, along 
with other Muslim students on this campus, was forced to create 
my own safe spaces due to the University aligning itself with the 
media’s conflation of Muslim students’ demand for safety and 
respect as an attempt at stifle others’ freedom of speech.

This experience made me think about the way in which other 

minorities on campus are marginalized, our shared sentiments 
and how our oppressions are inextricably linked.

I asked student leaders who have experience working on 

issues of diversity, equity and inclusion — either within their 
own communities or with the administration itself — to send 
me reflections on this issue. I originally conducted interviews 
with them in late October after the launch of the University’s 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion plan. However, in light of the 
election of Donald Trump, I felt that the conversation needed 
to be revisited so that these perspectives could be viewed in the 
context of a dramatic shift in the sociopolitical climate of the 
United States, a shift that will inevitably affect our own campus.

These students were asked one question: What would you 

share with the administration regarding diversity, equity and 
inclusion and campus climate?

As a hijab-wearing Muslim woman it was heartbreaking 

to me that another Muslim student on this campus would be 
threatened just for practicing her faith, and yet, I have seen more 
support from students, faculty, and administration than ever 
before. The truth is that Donald Trump’s victory is a product of 
a foundation of fear — built on implicit biases and frustrations 
that are and have been embedded in this nation for a long time. 
We must look in the mirror and ask ourselves what this country 
really is and what we can do in our power to create a more 
inclusive campus despite this shift.

Now it is more important than ever to have these conversations 

about what needs to be done in order to create a more inclusive 
and equitable world. The goal of this piece is to encourage and 
foster dialogue in a way that personalizes these experiences and 
allows readers to think of their own ideas.

JASMYNE JACKSON

THIRD-YEAR MED STUDENT / FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE 

BLACK MEDICAL ASSOCIATION

I cannot comprehend the cognitive dissonance it 

takes to value diversity yet believe that students are not 
academically and emotionally affected by the overt and 
covert acts of intolerance that occur nationally as well 
as on this very campus. As a Black, queer, female medi-
cal student, it is exhausting to unpack the psychological 
trauma of attacks on my personhood. When I was leav-
ing the hospital after a night shift, I received a phone call 
from my dad. He stated that he heard about the racist fly-
ers on my campus and told me he loves me and to be care-
ful. This is 2016. In reaction to “Kill em all” and “purify 
America” being painted on The Rock post-election, my 
cousin told me to be careful. I should not be told to be 
careful because of my race in 2016. A man threatened to 
set a woman on fire because of her religious beliefs and 
thus, forced a member of our community to remove her 
hijab. We have a humanistic obligation to protect those 
who are the most vulnerable to the manifestation of the 
hateful rhetoric that has been spewed out across the 
country. Some members of our community do not feel 
safe, and safety is a human right — it is an essential part 
of public health. The University has a responsibility to 
never be complacent in the face of injustice and needs to 
critique what aspects of this campus facilitate actions of 
hate. I stand in solidarity with people of color, my Mus-
lim brothers and sisters, immigrants, women, individu-
als with disabilities and the LGBTQ community. I will 
devote my Michigan degree to uplifting, and for me, that 
is the true Michigan Difference.

RACKHAM LIAISON, FORMER PRESIDENT

The administration has to make these issues relevant 

to every single student that comes across this campus, 
regardless of their identities or backgrounds … The big-
gest question that administration needs to answer right 
now is how will it protect the safety of the students, both 
physically and mentally. The outburst of hate crimes on 
campus and propaganda that appeals to hate and fear is 
not going to be addressed simply by acknowledging the 
problem in an email, or several emails for that matter. 
We need concrete action steps to protect our students, 
especially our Muslim and Latinx communities who are 
being openly targeted in election aftermath.

SOCIAL WORK STUDENT/ PEOPLE OF COLOR COLLECTIVE

When you’re used to privilege, equality feels like 

oppression. When you are used to everything benefit-
ting you, and suddenly, other voices are being heard 
more than yours, you’re of course going to feel some-
what left out … We are all aware that Republicans are 
not heartless folks. However, the Republican candidate 
built his campaign on hurting others through fear and 
exclusion. So when people decided it was more impor-
tant to vote for someone who actively used violent 
language and made promises to harm large groups of 
marginalized folks, they should not be calling for those 
belonging to the threatened groups and their allies 
to, “get over it.” The hateful acts on this campus have 
shown that people aren’t accepting diverse groups of 
people and their right to exist. I’m sorry Republican 
students feel unsafe, but no one is threatening to light 
them on fire, deport them or throw them down hills.

SHEEMA REHMAN

INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL RELIEF OF CHILDREN

It’s important to include everyone in this conversa-

tion because we all belong to different communities 
and are affected by issues differently, but at the end of 
the day we are all members of this university. Issues 
that we face today are not new, but rather they have 
become normalized given the rhetoric used by political 
figures, especially as much more visibly hateful mes-
sages are surfaced, rather than floating in the back-
ground as they have had been in the past.

ARMAITY MINWALLA

LSA SENIOR/ DIVERSITY PEER EDUCATOR IN COUZENS HALL 

The unpaid and unrecognized emotional labor of 

people of color on this campus has increased. Student 
organizers and leaders are carrying a lot of weight on 
their shoulders … What I need from the administration 
is a continuation and a step further in the messages 
they have already been sending. While the intentions 
of their anti-hate campaign are good, I would like to 
point out that some ideas are hateful and some of the 
discourse that has been occurring is hate speech. It is 
not the responsibility of marginalized communities to 
be re-traumatized over and over again because they 
are taking the time to educate others about oppres-
sion and experiences of hate. As for me, I will continue 
doing the work that I do to make sure that every single 
person on this campus, particularly those in my care 
in my residence hall, are safe and know that I am here 
for them. I love and support you all, and I will always 
be there for you.

This election and the rhetoric that has ensued 

after is not about just politics. I pride myself on being 
someone who is capable of reaching across the aisle 
and hearing other viewpoints, regardless of whether 
I agree with them or not. However, I am not always 
granted the same opportunity because of my religion 
and ethnicity. This is especially true now. I see people 
encouraging others to listen more, but what I am wor-
ried about is people not giving my viewpoints a chance 
simply because I call myself a Muslim. So to me, this 
election is about much more than just politics — it’s 
personal. How do I go about engaging in thoughtful 
and challenging dialogue when people across the aisle 
will inevitably and automatically see my viewpoints as 
less legitimate simply because of who I am?

AMERICAN VOTE — MICHIGAN CHAPTER

Administrators must earn the right to put diversity on 

the University’s brochures, website, etc. The University 
has to provide for its diverse community, and right now, 
that means making sure marginalized students (Muslim 
students, students of color, immigrant students, LGBTQ 
students) are safe. That is a human right that the Univer-
sity has a responsibility to protect. I would tell adminis-
trators to genuinely ask themselves if they are doing the 
absolute most they can; I recognize that they can’t alien-
ate groups of people and they have multiple interests 
weighing on them, but even given all of that, are admin-
istrators honestly doing the most they can to take action 
for students?

T

he first time I fell in love with water was the first 
time I almost drowned. I was 2 years old and 
running around my second home: The Valley Swim 

Club. My dad noticed I wasn’t eating lunch at the picnic 
table, so he went looking for me by the pool. There I was: 
submerged like a rock at the bottom of the shallow end. 
My dad, the hero in this story, claims that he yanked me 
out of the water by my arm as I coughed hard to get the 
water out of my throat. The funny thing is, I would be 
taking swim lessons in that same shallow end three years 
later.

After swim lessons I was immediately signed up 

for competitive swimming at the age of 6. It was the 
Delaware Valley Summer Swim League, and my team, 
the Valley Sharks, was the smallest and worst team in 
the conference. I remember wanting to swim butterfly, 
the most awkward and physically challenging stroke in 
the sport of swimming (bless my ambitious, six-year-old 
soul). Circling my arms as fast as I could, I felt so powerful 
going through the water as I swam that one, 25-meter lap. 
Little did I know, I would continue swimming for the 
next 13 years.

As strange as it sounds, swimming comes more 

naturally to me than walking. I never feel out of place 
in the water — my body immediately adapts with each 
stroke. I had only swum in the summers, but when I got 
to high school, my senior sister convinced freshman me 
to join the swim team instead of the basketball team. I 
had loved swimming, but I knew it would be tough: two 
(and sometimes three) practices a day, late nights and 
super early mornings, Saturday practices, and in general, 
extremely difficult workouts. But for some reason, 
something was calling out to me to do this … to continue 
swimming. So, I reluctantly obliged.

Soon enough, I was racing my sister in the 100 Butterfly, 

something I had never done before due to our separate age 
groups. It was always Lauren first, Erika second, and that 
only made me want to do better every race (Shevcheks live 

off of competition). The pool was the second home for my 
sister and me: We both grew up swimmers and became 
lifeguards, we both chose swimming over any other sport, 
and we both felt that we were most dominant in water. 
But in June of 2013, the pool changed for us completely.

A dive into a black-bottom pool made Lauren paralyzed 

from the nose down. The one person who knew water 
better than I did was now struggling to move, let alone 
swim. I asked her what it felt like to be in that pool, losing 
all the feeling and function in her body. She told me, “With 
every kick back to the surface, I lost more sensation. Then 
my legs just stopped working. I felt like a mermaid.”

It’s been a tough journey of recovery for Lauren since 

then. But, despite the catastrophic accident, my sister 
is still the same person she was before. The doctors had 
told her that even though the impact of the dive was so 
crucial, the water pressure saved her brain. The water 
saved my sister.

I have not looked at a pool the same way since. There 

will always be a scar of pain when I see the water and 
when I dive in for my own races. Yet, Lauren’s brain 
wasn’t the only one that was saved by water.

My senior year of high school I was diagnosed with 

severe anxiety. There were days when I genuinely could 
not handle the world, including myself and my own 
thoughts. However, I had a volleyball and swim team to 
lead, colleges to apply to, records to break. I concealed 
my anxiety with a façade of smiles and confidence. 
Truthfully, the one thing that got me through that period 
of time was the power of the pool.

That season I had set enormous goals for myself. With 

two torn rotator cuffs and a mental illness, I planned to 
break school records, go to districts (for 50 freestyle and 
the 200 free relay) and overall, have my team win as many 
league meets as possible. I channeled all of my energy, 
my stress and my deteriorating thoughts into the sport. 
And somehow, my anxiety turned into accomplishment. I 
stood at the top of the podium with my relay, holding our 

gold medals and knowing that our names and the record-
breaking time would be up on the board.

As any swimmer knows, the physical act of swimming 

is meditative. You can’t hear anything but the rippling 
motion of the water and your own thoughts. You somehow 
think of everything and nothing — it’s being mindful and 
mindless at the same time. It’s pure magic.

The water gets sucked into my skin; it runs down my 

hair, through my teeth. I can feel my heart thriving as if 
the water has entered my bloodstream. When I couldn’t 
tell others about my issues, the pool was all ears. When 
I had to cry, the goggles caught my tears. Personally, I 
believe water to be the most damaging and powerful 
force, but here I am also feeling so safe and content when 
I am in it.

Those who are close to me will know that when I am 

sad, I swim. When I am angry, I swim. When I make 
a huge mistake, I swim. When I need to dissect my 
thoughts, I swim. When I need to leave the world for a 
while, I swim. My body doesn’t have to think about the 
motions — it acts on its own. It knows when to flip, when 
to breathe, when to change from fly kick to flutter kick, 
when to break out of streamline and all the in between. 
Even though I almost died in the water when I was two, 
having the outlet of swimming and having my body react 
the way it does when it is in the pool has been my biggest 
blessing.

Though water is my safe haven, there still remains 

that slight touch of fear. However, even my sister’s injury 
did not stop her. By summer of 2015, she was back in the 
pool with my mom, trying to do strokes and float on her 
back (a form of hydrotherapy/rehabilitation). I slipped 
into the water next to Lauren, who sat in this cute, adult 
floaty. I looked at her, I looked at the water: “You know, 
we haven’t been in a pool together in four years,” I told 
her. The water still had its binds, and regardless of our 
rough journeys, it had brought my sister and I back home.

Water: My Sister’s Savior, My Best Friend

L

ast Tuesday night, I watched the map of the United 
States turn bright red and I felt a fist grip my heart. I 
had been trying to do homework and watch election 

coverage at the same time, but I’ve never been the best 
multi-tasker. As the night progressed, my notebook fell to 
the side and I found myself intently reading Washington 
Post coverage, analysis and speculation. Hours passed in 
minutes, and Hillary Clinton’s path to the White House 
went from assumed to unlikely to impossible. I wanted to 
stay up until the end, until every vote was in, because in 
my persistent optimism I waited for a deus ex machina, 
I waited for my own state to turn blue at the last minute. 
But, as we all know now, that didn’t happen. Michigan is 
still unaccounted for. I ended up falling asleep, feeling 
genuinely afraid of my own country, of the people who 
voted for Trump and his sexist, xenophobic, homophobic 
and racist rhetoric.

Needless to say, the next morning was painful. My heart 

still ached, and I still felt afraid, lost in my own country 
for the first time. Who were these people? Did they hate 
me too, because I’m a woman and Jewish? Are they sitting 
next to me on the Commuter North? Are they the swim-
mers I’m guarding at the Central Campus Recreational 
Building? But as the day passed, and I went through the 
motions of a normal Wednesday, I overheard conversa-
tions all over campus about how we can get through this 
together, and that we can’t give up. I saw chalkings all 
over the Diag, proclaiming that this is still home, that we 
all belong here, that love is strongest of all. And through-
out the day, I felt my various communities within and 
outside of the University of Michigan offering immeasur-
able support to one another. Being there for one another, 
because what else could we do? I felt loved, supported 
and heard by my friends and family. As I experienced this 
outpouring of love, my hope began to come back. It was 
also sad, to see my friends crying, fearing they will be 
persecuted simply for being themselves. Wednesday was 
bittersweet; I could feel the genuine fear of my friends 
who were the target of Trump’s rhetoric. I also felt the 
strength and optimism of a people that will not let hate 
prevail on this campus, in this country or in the world. I 
felt more determined than ever before to make a change, 
to push the government in the direction of justice.

Because, as disillusioned and helpless as I’ve felt time 

and time again, I know that the American government, 
though in some ways corrupt and owned by Big Business, 
is still for the people and by the people. We have to speak 
up. We have to make it impossible for them to compro-
mise our autonomy over our bodies, to intersect our com-
munities and wildlife with pipelines, our right to have 
clean water, and our right to marriage equality for all. I 
know this seems overly optimistic, but there are reasons 
why I feel this way.

The week before the election, I watched Leonardo 

DiCaprio’s documentary, “Before the Flood.” It was about 
climate change, the politics around it and the science 
of our devastatingly changing climate. As anyone who 
has ever seen a film about climate change can imagine, 
it got pretty bleak. But near the end, DiCaprio showed 
how public opinion can change the actions of politicians. 
There was a clip of President Barack Obama in 2008, say-
ing he was against same-sex marriage. The reason he said 
this was because he thought the majority of his constitu-
ents felt this way, and he did not want to lose their votes. 

Clearly, as Obama felt public opinion change, he changed 
his own position on same-sex marriage. Our opinions 
count. Our voices matter. We just have to use them.

As a white, female, Jewish college student, I don’t 

really know why people voted for President-elect Donald 
Trump. Not only did he spout hateful rhetoric through the 
entire election, but I’m pretty sure he is the least qualified 
person to ever run for president. But I’ve been working to 
understand where his voters were coming from, because I 
cannot just write them off. Though we have many differ-
ences, fundamentally they’re just people, like me. We will 
not get anywhere if we ignore these individuals, because 
that is what caused Trump to be elected. Love trumps 
hate, and that doesn’t mean only loving the people who 
voted for Hillary Clinton. Showing compassion to all peo-
ple, and really trying to understand them, is the only way 
to keep moving forward.

We need to think about what our country stands for. 

America: the land of the free, the home of the brave. A 
nation of many different cultures, religions and ethnici-
ties, living together, and thriving. Or a nation that builds 
a wall? A nation that threatens to burn women in hijabs? 
A nation with swastikas spray painted on walls? That 
is not my nation. I refuse to accept that as the America 

I’ve grown up in. I still believe that love is strong. If we 
meet each other, and really try to understand each other, 
I think that hate will fall away. We are all just people, and 
we have a responsibility to treat each other the way every 
person inherently deserves to be treated, regardless of 
politics.

Now, almost a week has passed since the election. This 

time last week, I was straining to get a glimpse of Obama 
over the shoulders of three extremely tall men at Ray 
Fisher Stadium, feeling the hope that Obama’s speeches 
provide. Last Tuesday, I was elated, thinking that last 
glass ceiling was about to be shattered. Since last Wednes-
day, two crime alerts have been sent out, regarding ethnic 
and religious intimidation that occurred on campus, right 
near my house. If this is happening here, in “liberal” Ann 
Arbor, I’m scared for the rest of the country. But also, 
there has been a protest against this intimidation, and 
many have gathered in the Diag to show their support for 
tolerance and love. Today, I feel a bit less optimistic than 
I did last Wednesday. I think the reality of the next four 
years is starting to set in. And yet I refuse to give up hope. 
I will hold on to love and optimism, and tolerance, and I 
will not stop advocating for a compassionate and empa-
thetic understanding of all people.

LSA SENIOR / FOUNDER OF MICHIGAN REFUGEE

It’s hard to put into words the disappointment I have 

felt over the past couple of days. My disappointment has 
nothing to do with partisanship, but everything to do 
with the fact that a man, who ran a campaign on white 
supremacy, racism, sexism and xenophobia, is now our 
president-elect — and more so, that half of our country 
supports the sentiments that this individual has propa-
gated throughout his campaign. What this election has 
affirmed to many of us — women, individuals of color, 
immigrants, refugees, Black individuals, individuals 
with disabilities — is that to half of this country, we are 
simply disposable. I will not wait until this individual has 
done something to oppose him — it is too late for that. 
Hate crimes have spiked 78 percent throughout the cam-
paign and are happening on campus. Racism, sexism, 
islamophobia, etc. have all become legitimized. I hope 
that many of us remember the shock and pain that we 
felt to see all of the progress of eight years disappear in 
the two minutes that put our current president-elect over 
the edge. And I hope we all make a promise to ourselves 
to never let something like this happen again. It is time to 
organize and mobilize, to build coalitions, to lean on one 
another and reject hatred at every turn. I do believe in us 
because when I look to the future I see my fellow class-
mates fighting for a better world beside me. We must 
remember that out of the darkness comes change; it will 
not be easy, and it will not be without struggle. But, I’m 
ready. This is the moment where we decide who we are 
as a generation; welcome to the fight.

by the University’s support for those who are hurt by 
the election of Donald Trump and they themselves feel 
prejudiced by the University for “taking sides.” I, how-
ever, implore the administration to keep in mind the 
structural hierarchies and systems of power, privilege 
and oppression in place outside of the bubble of our 
University. The administration should consider cen-

those community members who have faced structural 
violence, discrimination and exploitation that has his-

After the election, I realize how much incidents out-

side of campus also affect students on campus and lead to 
incidents on campus. It has definitely been very difficult 
following the election for me to continue on with daily 
life and tasks, but this time I have felt that I have received 
more support than usual. I have had professors, GSIs, 
students, etc. acknowledge and be cognizant of the fact 
that the election results definitely affected me in negative 
ways and will continue to do so. The outpour of support 
has been very refreshing, and I appreciate all the people 
that have reached out to me. Students will continue to be 
negatively affected by incidents off campus as well even 
if nothing directly happened to them. Everyone needs to 
stand up, show support and show up. If there is an event/
protest/vigil related to incidents on campus, show up and 
then be willing to learn from the experiences of those that 
are marginalized. Listen, learn how to be an ally and to 
unlearn the isms and phobias, and be willing to change 
your view points. Share what you learn with more people 
on campus and even your families. Ask marginalized 
folx how they would like to be supported. You can not sit 
idly and pretend like nothing is happening or undermine 
someone’s experiences. Think and come up with more 
preventative measures and learn new ways to support 
those on campus, especially those who hold marginalized 
identities and have intersectional identities that make 
things even more difficult for them. As a PoC and Mus-
lim American, I have always needed everyone’s support 
and will continue to, so realize that your allyhood is and 
should be the beginning of your activism.
