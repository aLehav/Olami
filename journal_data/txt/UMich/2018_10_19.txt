Four years ago, the Black 

Student Union launched the 
online campaign #BBUM, or 
Being Black at the University 
of Michigan, and gave the 
University 
seven 
days 
to 

respond to seven demands. 
Some of the demands included 
more 
affordable 
campus 

housing, an increase in Black 
representation on campus and 
a digitization of documents 
in the University’s Bentley 
Historical Library.

Now, 
four 
years 
after 

BSU put forward its initial 
demands, 
the 
organization 

and the Bentley Historical 
Library have completed the 
project to digitize over 66,000 
records from the Department 
of Afroamerican and African 
Studies.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Amid questions of election security and 

potential system hacking in the upcoming 
midterm elections, Engineering prof. J. 
Alex Halderman spoke at the University of 

Michigan Alumni Center Thursday night 
about vulnerabilities in U.S. voting systems. 
Last June, Halderman appeared before the 
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to 
testify about such.

“Hacking the Vote” was presented by the 

Alumni Association, the Center for Local, 
State and Urban Policy, the Gerald R. Ford 

School of Public Policy and the College of 
Engineering. Halderman, who has studied 
voting systems for over a decade — and last 
made news on campus when his email was 
spoofed in a racist email scandal — was 
joined by LSA professor Walter Mebane, an 
expert on detecting electoral fraud. Steve 
Friess, a former Knight-Wallace fellow 

and freelance journalist, moderated the 
discussion.

The professors discussed the reasoning 

behind election security, past and current 
issues with voting systems, public response 
to elections and recounting votes and 
the federal government’s role in making 
elections

Regents talk $1 billion endowment 
increase, Power Plant schedule

ANNIE KLUS/Daily

CSG Vice President Izzy Baer speaks during the Board of Regents meeting at the U-M Flint Thursday.

The Board of Regents also approved model portfolio for long-term investment plans

The University of Michigan 

Board of Regents approved 
the 
construction 
schedule 

and schematic design of the 
Central Power Plant expansion 
and discussed the University’s 
endowment $1 billion increase 
at its Thursday meeting in Flint. 

Eucharia Ganda, president of 
the U-M Flint student body, and 
Izzy Baer, vice president of U-M 
Ann Arbor’s Central Student 
Government, 
also 
addressed 

their 
student 
government 

initiatives and concerns.

In March 2017, the Board 

of Regents approved the $80 
million Central Power Plant 
expansion, 
a 
12,000-foot 

addition expected to reduce 

greenhouse gas emissions by 
100,000 tons per year. The 
new addition is intended to 
move the University closer to 
its 2025 sustainability goal — 
to 
reduce 
greenhouse 
gas 

emissions by 25 percent below 
2006 
levels. 
Though 
the 

project is projected to reduce 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions, 

some question whether a long-
term investment in fossil fuel is 

the best solution.

In a Public Affairs report, 

Kevin 
Hegarty, 
University 

executive vice president and 
chief financial officer, said the 
goal will help the University stay 
on target for reducing emissions 
as well as keeping track of 
finances.

Omar 

Offendum presented to a group of 
over 200 students and faculty on 
Thursday about his experiences 
as a Syrian-American hip-hop

about growing up in his diverse 
Northern Virginia neighborhood, 
as well as the difficulty of weaving 
together his multiple identities into 
a coherent whole.

Offendum’s presentation, which 

took place during a lecture of the 
Introduction to Arab-American 
Studies course at the University of 
Michigan, touched on themes of 
loss, political activism and rising 
xenophobia. Offendum said his

administration 
informed 

her if she taught a course on 
the history of photography, 
she would not be allowed 
to show images of sex, 
children, violence, drugs 
or “complicated emotional 
imagery.” Poor scheduled 
a meeting with the prison 
warden 
and 
another 

department 
secretary 

and, after describing her 
curriculum, was granted 
permission to teach the 
class 
as 
she 
originally 

intended.

The men in the facility 

were not allowed to have 
cameras, but Poor wanted 
them 
to 
experience 

creating art of their own. The 
inmates were given images of 
well-known art and instructed 
to 
“map” 
the 
images 
by 

writing their observations and 
thoughts on top of the images. 
On the back of the image, they 
wrote narratives about the 
picture and their experience.

Art & Design freshman 

Elizabeth Mizer commented 
on Poor’s artistic work at the 
prison.

“Well I think it’s really 

important for people in the 
prison to get to experience 
like creativity and imagination 
when 
they 
don’t 
really 

normally get to have access to 
that,” Mizer said.

University 
of 
Michigan 

researchers are working on 
the European Space Agency’s 
BepiColombo mission to send 
a spacecraft to Mercury’s 
atmosphere, 
a 
University 

press release announced. The 
mission hopes to analyze the 
planet and the solar system as 
a whole.

Stefano Livi, a research 

professor of Climate and Space 
Sciences 
and 
Engineering, 

leads the investigation on 
the 
portion 
of 
the 
craft 

that measures the gases in 
Mercury’s upper atmosphere. 

James 
Slavin, 
another 

professor of Climate and Space 
Sciences 
and 
Engineering, 

assists 
on 
analyzing 

Mercury’s atmospheric gases 
and its chemical composition. 
Slavin has worked on Mercury 
research since its start and, as 
a University of California-Los 
Angeles graduate student, he 
studied the planet’s plasma 
process and the impacts of 
solar wind.

This 
mission, 
which 

launches on Oct. 20 from 
French Guiana, is only the 
third 
mission 
in 
history 

to 
explore 
Mercury. 
The 

European 
Space 
Agency’s 

BepiColombo hopes to answer 
critical questions about the 
planet’s makeup, atmosphere 

and 
magnetic 
field. 
From 

these results, scientists can 
work to learn more about the 
solar system’s past and future.

Livi and Slavin work on the 

particle spectrometer called 
Strofio, which uses a rotating 
electric field and a time-of-
flight system to evaluate the 
mass of particles in Mercury’s 
uppermost atmosphere. The 
time it takes for particles 
to pass through the system 
allow scientists to determine 
the particle’s mass. Using the 
mass will give researches the 
necessary information to date 
the makeup of the planet.

“Many 
theories 
have 

been developed. … Without 
measurements of what this 
gas is made of, how it reacts to 

external events and how 
it is swept away from the 
planet, we are working 
almost 
completely 
in 

the blind,” Livi said in 
the press release. 

Through the space mission, 

researchers 
can 
gather 

information from the orbit 
time of the satellite, take 
photos of the planet, analyze 
the x-ray and cosmic rays 
on Mercury’s surface and 
evaluate the atmosphere — the 
task of the Michigan research 
team.

The researchers can then 

use the information about the 
particles and their proximity 
the 
sun 
to 
learn 
about 

Mercury’s magnetic field and 
its interactions with solar 
wind.

“As human beings, we all 

want to know how we come to 
be as a species on this planet 
and, eventually, what’s going 
to happen to us,” Slavin said in 
the release. “It’s all ultimately 
about origins and destinies.

WORDS OF WISDOM

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
“It’s easy to say that the entire current board and new board 

members are all strong supporters of academic freedom. I think it’s the 
linchpin of any great institution and it’s certainly made this institution 
great I think that academic freedom is the basis of our institution and 
without it, getting any sort of structure of scriptures on something would 
be inappropriate unless it was something harmful being taught.”

Regent Andrea Fischer Newman, running for re-election to the Board of Regents this November

know 
where 
I 
was 
from,” 

Offendum said. “When I’d tell 
them I was from Syria, I’d get a 
weird joke about breakfast cereal 
or something. Now you can’t turn 
on the news without hearing 
about it at least once a day.”

Rackham 
student 
Yahya 

Alami Hafez, a graduate student 
instructor for Introduction to 
Arab-American 
Studies, 
said 

Offendum’s presentation showed 
how current artistic mediums 
such as rap actually trace back to a 
long and rich Arab history. Hafez 
said before each discussion, he 
shows the class a music video 
from an Arab region to highlight 
this connection.

“I think culture is a really good 

entry point to engage student 
learning,” Hafez said. “Cultural 
production 
is 
political, 
it’s 

something that shapes discourse. 
When folks are studying history, 
they’re looking toward material 
artifacts or something that they 
can examine — sometimes that’s 
archives and sometimes it’s 
museum exhibits or songs.”

Offendum 
performed 
a 

number of his own spoken word 
poems and raps, often prompting 
the audience to participate by 
motioning to sing portions of 
the lyrics. Offendum opened the 

lecture by rapping “Damascus,” 
an Arabic poem he strongly 
identifies with and ultimately 
transformed into a song.

“For a kid growing up with a 

mother from Damascus, I had 
memorized that poem when I 
was like 12,” Offendum said. “It’s 
been a big part of my life and 
it’s kind of a good introductory 
piece to my work because it has 
the element of poetry in it and 
rap and cultural translation and 
longing for Syria.”

Offendum said his work often 

contends with the changing idea 
of home, as he was born in Saudi 
Arabia but grew up just outside 
of Washington, D.C. He said he 
was especially inspired by one 
of his mentors, who told him 
he should look to the future to 
understand where home is.

“I was telling him how I feel 

this sort of transient feeling in 
my heart, like I don’t really feel 
like I’m from here even though 
I’ve been here pretty much my 
whole life,” Offendum said. 
“He’s like, ‘Listen, home is not 
where your grandparents are 
buried — home is where your 
grandchildren will be born. Look 
to the future, think about the 
future, think about what your 
purpose is here today.’”

more secure. They also touched 
on voter registration system 
issues, election audits, the 2016 
presidential election and their 
experiences with research.

“The Russians who hacked 

into state election systems and 
voter registration systems in 
several states in 2016, they had 
the ability to go much farther 
than 
they 
did,” 
Halderman 

said. “They chose not to pull the 
trigger. We’re right back in that 
position we were in in 2016. The 
question is not whether we’re 
safe because we’re not safe. The 
question is, are our adversaries 
going to decide to pull the 
trigger?”

In addition to his six-minute 

testimony in June, Halderman 
has returned to the Capitol 
frequently to discuss the $380 

million in funding for states 
to modernize and secure their 
equipment with state legislatures 
and 
congressional 
staff. 

Halderman has also assisted 
Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., on an 
election reform package.

According to an article in the 

Michigan Alumnus, Halderman 
said he was inspired to look 
into voting machines during a 
question-and-answer 
session 

in an Introduction to Computer 
Science class. Afterwards, he 
appeared with a United Nations 
ambassador 
to 
explain 
the 

Internet Freedom Technology 
Showcase 
and 
“refraction 

networking” — a way to allow 
users access to banned networks 
and services while tricking the 
computer into thinking they have 
not been granted access — in 
2015. Halderman went on to lead 
a coalition funded by the State 
Department on the concept.

“We’re 
much 
better 
at 

seeing unsuccessful intrusions 

than 
successful 
intrusions,” 

Halderman said. “It’s silly to 
know someone is trying to get 
in — you see someone jiggling 
the lock — but, if they found an 
open window on the side of the 
basement and climbed in through 
it where you didn’t have a sensor, 
well, you wouldn’t know that by 
monitoring the front door.”

Mebane focuses his research 

on “election forensics” — a term 
he created — with the goal of 
creating 
tools 
for 
detecting 

anomalies and fraud in voting. He 
said he uses statistical methods 
to look for patterns to see if 
voting reflects the intentions of 
the voters in elections around the 
world.

He was specifically asked 

about his experience helping 
with voting security in Kenya 
last year and in the 2004 
presidential election in Franklin, 
Ohio. 
Mebane 
said 
he 
did 

research on the Kenya election 
and recommended it should 

be annulled, with the Kenyan 
Supreme Court agreeing. He said 
election and voter registration 
data in the U.S., however, is more 
difficult to attain.

“The hard part is proving 

when something is unusual or 
when something is an anomaly … 
Is that due to fraud or is that due 
to just regular politics?” Mebane 
said. 
“Statistical 
methods 

can tell us when the votes are 
switched, but you can’t tell who 
switched them, and it makes 
a big difference if the voters 
switched them through strategic 
consideration compared to some 
bad guy switching them.”

In Michigan, Halderman said 

people vote on paper, but only a 
few companies handle counting 
of the votes. If the software is 
bugged, a hacker could alter 
election results without touching 
any machines. 

should be transparency about 
the University and its past 
dealings with race relations.”

In response to the 2014 

#BBUM 
demands, 
Terrence 

McDonald, 
director 
of 
the 

Bentley 
Historical 
Library, 

explained 
archivists 

began 
compiling 
recorded 

interactions 
between 

University officials and Black 
activists.

“The 
digitization 
project 

began when student members 
of the BSU, working on a history 
of the Black Action movements, 
asked if those records could be 
made more available through 
digitization,” McDonald said. 
“We prepared a digital edition 
of the demands from and 

University responses to those 
movements, and the idea for 
digitizing the collection grew 
from there.”

In 
addition 
to 
demands, 

#BBUM 
sparked 
a 

national 
conversation 

on 
Twitter 
around 
the 

experiences of Black students 
in 
higher 
education. 
The 

movement staged protests on 
campus 
to 
bring 
further 

attention to their cause.

According to the University 

Record, funds for the project 
were provided by the Office 
of the Provost and the process 
of digitizing the records took 
more than eight months to 
complete. 
The 
new 
online 

collection features audio and 
video recordings of visiting 
scholars 
and 
activists, 

including Rosa Parks and Jesse 
Jackson, newspaper clippings 

and other materials related to 
the Black Action Movements 
from 1969 to 1995.

The 
entire 
collection 

can 
be 
accessed 
digitally 

by 
all 
University 
students, 

researchers, faculty and staff, 
and to the public in person at 
the Bentley Historical Library.

Matthew 
Countryman, 

chair of the Department of 
Afroamerican 
and 
African 

Studies, said in a statement to 
the Record that he is especially 
thrilled that these historical 
documents have been digitized.

“As we approach the 50th 

anniversary of the Center for 
Afroamerican 
and 
African 

Studies’ founding, we could not 
be more excited to have these 
essential historical documents 
digitized 
and 
available 

online to students, scholars 
and 
community 
members,” 

Countryman said.

LSA senior Kayla McKinney, 

speaker of BSU, said the group 
called for digitization of the 
Bentley records to increase the 
accessibility of these materials. 
In addition, McKinney said 
the project grew out of the 
group’s desire to call attention 
to the relations between Black 
students and the University in 
the past.

“Since then the Bentley has 

worked tirelessly both with the 
BSU and on their own to gain 
and digitize these records and 
we appreciate them greatly,” 
McKinney said. “Having these 
records digitized is important 
because student activism is 
often erased in U-M’s diversity 
effort.”

and World Report, the University 
of Michigan had the eighth largest 
endowment of all universities as 
of the end of the 2017 fiscal year.

“We have great confidence in 

the University’s overall approach 
to 
investments 
and 
in 
the 

stewardship of these important 
financial 
resources,” 
Regent 

Kathy White (D) said.

During the meeting, the Board 

of Regents also approved a model 

portfolio for the University’s 
long-term portfolio. The model 
portfolio provides a plan for 
the 
University’s 
long-term 

investment allocation of each 
asset class.

Regent Andrew Richner (R), 

the chair of the board, said the 
approval of the portfolio is an 
effort to monitor the returns on 
University investments.

“By putting this item on 

our agenda and approving the 
portfolio on an ongoing basis, 
the Board of Regents will keep 
current on the risks associated 
with the investment portfolio 
and 
further 
mitigate 
risks 

associated with noncompliance 
with University policy,” Richner 
said.

Baer addressed the board, 

outlining 
CSG’s 
newest 

initiatives. In order to increase 
student voter turnout, CSG is 
providing free transportation to 
polling places on Nov. 6, as well as 

stamped envelopes for absentee 
ballots. According to Baer, CSG 
plans to offer a series of town 
halls, the first of which is on 
Oct. 29 at 6 p.m. in the Michigan 
League.

“We will be hosting our first 

town hall this month focused 
on 
housing 
affordability 
on 

campus,” 
Baer 
said. 
“Based 

on student feedback we have 
determined housing affordability 
to be extremely salient amongst 
our student body, and while we 
are working on initiatives now 
to tackle this issue, we want 
to hear directly from students 
and community members about 
what they think would decrease 
housing 
costs 
and 
improve 

housing initiatives in the future.”

Baer 
also 
reported 
her 

administration has been working 
with MDining to improve dining 
experiences for students with 
dietary restrictions. According 
to Baer, South Quad dining hall 

will open a kosher kitchen in the 
coming weeks, and the dining 
app will be upgraded to include 
the ingredients of each dish.

“With the proliferation of 

food allergies, we have focused 
on ways to make all students feel 
confident and safe on campus,” 
Baer said. “As you may already 
know, all dining halls now carry 
Auvi-Qs, which is a device 
similar to EpiPens. The dining 
staff is now trained on how to 
administer them if a student 
suffers from an allergic reaction.”

Ganda 
spoke 
about 
her 

administration’s student voting 
initiatives and the need for more 
on-campus spaces for student 
organizations. 
Ganda 
also 

addressed the need for minority 
representation 
and 
cultural 

awareness among faculty and 
campus at large.

hen I arrived at the 
University of Michigan 
at the beginning of 
freshman year, my friends and I 
discovered Bird electric scooters on 
the Diag. I’d never ridden e-scooters 
since they had not yet made it to 
my native New York City, where 
Citi Bike and Uber reign supreme. 
“Pick up and drop off anywhere,” 
the app promised, for only 15 cents 
per minute. We took them for a spin. 
Soon we were hooked. We used Bird 
to get to class on time, explore the 
Ann Arbor downtown scene and visit 
friends on North Campus, all for only 
a dollar or two a ride. Birds solved the 
busy student’s central problem: how 
to quickly get to a destination that 
is beyond a walk for a low cost. We 
kept saying to ourselves, “Why hadn’t 
somebody come up with this years 
ago?”
After weeks of Birds popping up 
everywhere in Ann Arbor, the city 
began confiscating them off the 
street. Riders had driven Birds on 
sidewalks in violation of ordinances 
and left them parked in the street. 
Then, in September, the city of Ann 
Arbor talked about limiting Birds 
further. In an instant, it seemed the 
app that had given us inexpensive 
freedom and utility for weeks 
was now the vice of delinquent 
troublemakers. I set out to better 
understand the Bird: What are the 
dangers? Do e-scooters bring more 
benefit than harm to Ann Arbor? 
What I found is that Bird is the 
future of transportation for students 
at the University of Michigan.
First, financially, Birds are for 
everyone. It is possibly the most 
egalitarian transportation available 
on campus. College is expensive 
and an Uber or Lyft comes with set 
minimum fees and a calculated route 
that can add cost. It’s hard to take an 
Uber anywhere on campus for less 
than $7. Bird offers point A to point 
B transportation for a dollar to start 
and only 15 cents per minute! You 
can get from the Hill Neighborhood 
to the Diag for slightly more than 
a dollar, and you’ll never miss that 
lecture again. Furthermore, Birds 
are far less expensive than bicycles. 
An average “lifestyle” bicycle is 
priced upwards of $250, and more 
specialized mountain bikes go for 
$2,000 and more. In addition, you 
have to account for maintenance, 
repair and a bike lock or two. During 
Welcome Week, we’re told that one 

of the most frequently stolen items 
on campus is a bicycle. So, for the 
hundreds of dollars you’d need to 
sink into a bike and accessories, you 
could just take Birds for the semester. 
Second, Birds are one of the 
most 
environmentally 
friendly 
transportation services on campus. 
The watts of electricity used by 
a Bird is nominal, so even if the 
energy is originally created by a 
fossil-fuel-burning power plant, the 
environmental harm is negligible. 
As electric generation in the state 
of Michigan gradually transitions 
to natural gas, solar and wind, the 
environmental argument for Birds 
becomes more compelling. E-scooters 
can also persuade people to use public 
transportation because most scooter 
trips are in the last mile of transit, that 
one to two-mile gap from the station 
to the final destination.
Third, 
Bird’s 
e-scooters 
are 
the 
most 
consumer-oriented 
transportation choice. You pay only 
for what you want and for as long 
as you want it. Birds don’t have a 
waiting period of upwards of seven 
minutes which typical for an Uber, 
taxi or bus. Just scan it with your 
phone and go. Birds take you exactly 
where you want to go, right to the 
front door. Because of the à la carte 
nature of Birds, there is no obligation 
to maintain or lock it up when you’re 
finished. Just park it on the sidewalk, 
out of the way of pedestrian traffic, 
and go about your day.
But what are the downsides of 
these e-scooters? The most frequently 
cited concern is the potential for 
accident and death. Major city 
newspapers, like the Los Angeles 
Times, report alarming upticks in 
e-scooter-related 
hospital 
visits, 
from scrapes and bruises to severe 
head injuries. As Bird and Lime, two 
dominant e-scooter providers, both 
launched their multi-city expansions 
in 2017, reliable statistics for these 
incidents have not yet been compiled. 
For the meantime, all we have to 
go on are anecdotal, often alarmist, 
news reports of e-scooter accidents 
and fatalities.
Since their launches in two 
dozen cities over a year ago, 
Bird reports approximately 10.5 
million rides and Lime reports 11 
million rides. From the combined 
companies’ 
recorded 
deaths 
involving their rideables, e-scooter 
usage involves approximately one 
death for every 10.75 million rides. 

By comparison, bicycles appear to 
be quite dangerous and expensive 
from a health care perspective, and 
yet remain a celebrated mode of 
transportation. The medical journal 
Injury Prevention at the University 
of 
California, 
San 
Francisco 
recently reported there were 3.8 
million bicycle accidents and 9,839 
deaths in the U.S. from 1997 to 2013. 
In 2016, there were approximately 
470,000 bicycle accidents and 840 
deaths in the U.S. The majority 
of those deaths (30 percent) were 
caused by being struck by an 
automobile and the next largest 
statistic 
(20 
percent) 
involved 
bicycle riders not paying attention or 
suffering rider error. The majority 
of bicycle fatalities (58 percent) do 
not occur at intersection locations 
and only 4 percent occurred in 
bike lanes. The time period of 6:00 
p.m. to 9:00 p.m. had the highest 
frequency of bike fatalities (26 
percent) and alcohol involvement 
(BAC of .01) was reported in 35 
percent of the crashes that resulted 
in bicycle fatalities. Despite these 
rather gruesome statistics, there 
is no local or national call to 
eliminate bicycles in our country. 
Virtually all of the responses to 
the dangers of bicycle use propose 
the imposition of stricter safety 
regulations, changing user habits 
or improving transportation laws 
and infrastructure. Apply these 
precautions to Bird and you’ll make 
them just as safe as bicycles.
Similarly, the approach by the 
University and the city to the arrival 
of the e-scooter should be to find 
ways to encourage e-scooter usage, 
admittedly with improved safety 
and security. The University and the 
city government should encourage 
a scenario in which e-scooter 
companies like Bird unite with 
bicycle manufacturers to advocate 
for a shared solution. As scooters 
operate at much slower speeds 
than bicycles, the use of scooters 
on sidewalks should be evaluated. 
Electric rideables should be allowed 
wherever bicycles are legal, like 
bike lanes and protected paths. The 
statistics from decades of bicycle data 
should be used to craft sensible policy 
that recognizes the brilliant potential 
of an 
electric scooter future in 
Ann Arbor.

Marketing to Gen Z
I

t seems that all people 
can talk about lately are those 
pesky millennials and their 
consumer habits, whether it means 
buying avocado toast or Kylie 
Jenner lipsticks. What we often 
seem to forget, however, is that 
the millennial generation is now 
comprised of adults and Generation 
Z is no longer comprised of babies. 
In fact, Gen Z, or the demographic 
group made up of those born 
between the late 1990s and around 
2015, will account for 40 percent 
of all consumers by 2020. This 
means that we’ll likely see a vast 
change in mainstream forms of 
advertising in the next few years as 
Gen Z’s consumer preferences are 
fundamentally different to those of 
millennials.
One 
example 
of 
such 
strategies is Dote, a shopping app 
that’s targeted mainly at Gen Z 
consumers. Dote works as a virtual 
mall: It allows users to select items 
from over 140 retailers, pay only one 
time (rather than pay separately to 
each retailer) and receive all the 
items in one package. According to 
Fashionista, “the typical Dote user 
is a female between the ages of 13 
and 22 years old. She visits the app 
about four times a day and spends 
an average of 40 minutes on it.”
How did these users find out 
about Dote? It wasn’t through 
traditional advertising. I learned 
about Dote through my younger 
sister, Brianna Harshe, who, at 12 
years old, is smack in the middle of 
Gen Z and an avid user of Dote.
“I watch a lot of YouTubers 
like Hannah Meloche and Summer 
Mckeen,” Harshe explained to me. 
“I got Dote because I saw them 
talking about it. They went on a 
bunch of trips because of Dote and 
they would advertise for Dote on 
their trips. It didn’t really matter to 
me that it was advertising because 
they were still going to Fiji and stuff 
because of it.”
What is she talking about? 
Well, Meloche and Mckeen are 
high-school-age 
social 
media 
personalities who avidly post on 
Instagram, Twitter and YouTube 
about 
everything 
from 
their 
makeup routines to their inside 
jokes with their friends. They 

recently went on a luxury vacation 
to Fiji with several other social 
media personalities. All expenses 
of the trip were covered by Dote. 
As members of Gen Z tend to do, 
they posted countless photos on 
Instagram and videos on YouTube 
of their trip. In every photo and 
video, they made sure to tag Dote, 
or at least thank them for the trip. 
Boom: Every Gen Z member who 
already watches Meloche’s and 
Mckeen’s videos has now been 
exposed to Dote. This isn’t the first 
trip that Dote has sent girls on. In 
the past, the “Dote Girls” have been 
to Miami, Aspen, Colo., Malibu, 
Calif. and even the music festival 
Coachella (or “Dotechella”).
The reason that Dote appeals 
so much to Gen Z is that its founder 
and CEO, Lauren Farleigh, chose to 
advertise in a way that truly reached 
this segment. Gen Z is often called 
the iGeneration because it’s the first 
generation that can’t remember 
a 
world 
without 
smartphones 
and social media. Because of 
this, according to Forbes, “While 
traditional celebrities once had a 
monopoly on influence, ‘regular’ 
people are now gaining influence 
online based on their unique voices, 
opinions and perspectives.”
Harshe affirms this sentiment: 
“I trust the YouTubers I watch 
because they’re a lot more genuine. 
It seems like they’re showing their 
true selves. With a lot of celebrities, 
it seems like they just put on a mask 
to please people. … I usually find out 
about products from YouTubers, 
even if it’s on Instagram or 
another app. It’s more like a friend 
recommending me a product than a 
commercial.”
Members of Gen Z are generally 
cognizant of this generational gap. 
They see traditional advertising 
techniques 
and 
celebrity 
endorsements, but they tune them 
out fairly easily. Dote was able 
to catch onto this difference and 
use it to its advantage. “From our 
perspective, we see these retailers 
who haven’t fully identified or 
caught up with that shift,” Farleigh 
told 
Fashionista. 
“They 
really 
are trying to use old marketing 
techniques for this new generation, 
but not authentically engaging 

these social creators and their Gen 
Z followers.”
A good example of Dote’s ability 
to market to Gen Z is its partnership 
with 
17-year-old 
YouTube 
sensation 
Emma 
Chamberlain, 
who is practically a household 
name among Gen Z, thanks to her 
sarcastic personality that shines 
through in her videos about thrift 
shopping, going to school and 
drinking 
coffee. 
According 
to 
Forbes, 
“(Chamberlain’s) 
social 
media engagement — the amount 
of likes and comments of a post 
divided by the total amount of 
followers — is averaging around 25 
percent on Instagram. If you’re not 
in the social media world, you might 
not understand how mind-boggling 
that is. To give you a comparison, 
Kim Kardashian and Selena Gomez 
are averaging 9 percent and 5 
percent engagement, based on their 
last five posts.”
Chamberlain might not be a 
typical celebrity, but she has an 
incredibly loyal following, and Dote 
made a smart but unusual move in 
partnering with her. Chamberlain’s 
store, which is called High Key by 
Emma, was the first brand to be 
sold exclusively on Dote and sold 
out in just two hours. Clothing lines 
by celebrities don’t usually have 
that kind of success rate, but the 
personal connection that Gen Z 
members feel with YouTube stars 
creates an indescribable loyalty.
Harshe confirms, “I follow 
YouTubers more than celebrities 
because they’re more relatable. Like 
Hannah Meloche lives in Michigan 
and she just lives a normal teen 
life and goes to school, which is 
attainable for kids like me if we 
wanted to follow in her footsteps.”
Sending a group of teenage girls 
on a trip to Fiji might seem like an 
odd way to advertise your product, 
but if you know Generation Z, 
then you know how important 
social media is to them. Put a 
group of teenage girls in Fiji, and 
the Instagram photos will come 
automatically. As long as they know 
to tag Dote, that’s all the advertising 
you need.

My body isn’t mine

MILES STEPHENSON | COLUMN

Editor’s note: The author’s 
name was omitted to protect 
their identity.
I 
 

was sitting in Biology 172 
on a Friday morning in 
November 2014 after my 
first semi-formal when I got an 
email from a woman involved 
with Title IX at the University 
of Michigan asking to speak 
to me about an event that had 
been reported. Then came the 
text from my resident adviser, 
who had apparently been on 
duty when I’d been locked out 
of my dorm and crying the 
previous night, explaining he 
was a mandatory reporter and 
that I’d said some concerning 
things.
I had flashes of what had 
happened in my mind, but I 
couldn’t remember what I’d 
said to my RA. I panicked. 
Everything felt fuzzy, and I 
couldn’t face the memories 
threatening to surface — the 
drink from a boy I never 
should have accepted, how 
I felt like I was looking and 
speaking 
through 
a 
fog 
afterward. 
So 
I 
decided 
nothing 
had 
happened, 
emailed the woman back and 
asked her to never contact me 
again and told my concerned 
friends and RA that I’d just 
been drunk.
That wasn’t the only time 
something 
happened 
my 
freshman year. Two nights, 
two different guys. The shame 
often threatens to swallow me 
whole.
On New Year’s Eve, I was in 
Ann Arbor and went to a frat 
with a friend. She met up with 
her boyfriend, and I was with a 
boy who seemed nice enough. 
Until he wasn’t. To this day, I 
can feel the visceral terror that 
came when I realized what 
was about to happen, and that 
I couldn’t stop it. When I tried 
to scream, he put his hands 
on my throat and told me to 
shut up because he knew I 
wanted this. I froze, and my 
memories from that point feel 
like I was watching it happen. 
The sound of metal clicking 
sends me into a panic, even 
now, because of the sound of 
his belt buckle. I remember 
crying in a bathroom, and 
when I called a friend from 
home, 
they 
laughed 
and 
told me I sounded so drunk 
they couldn’t understand. In 

reality, I was crying so hard 
and was too panicked to be 
coherent — I’d been sober for 
hours at that point. So, again, 
I decided I had to be fine. I 
pushed it away, told myself it 
had just been rough sex and 
that I needed to get over it.
I pretended I was OK and 
that nothing had happened for 
years. I’d developed an eating 
disorder in high school, which 
had 
gone 
untreated, 
and 
after these events, I spiraled. 
I had panic attacks almost 
daily, missed class because I 
started to cry and my heart 
raced when leaving my dorm. 
I rarely ate, and when I did, I 
threw up, desperate to be so 
small that I would disappear. 
I eventually had to withdraw 
that winter semester, blaming 
the escalation of my eating 
disorder on poor body image, 
perfectionism and academic 
stress. For the next two years, 
I went in and out of treatment, 
plagued by impossible anxiety, 
poor sleep, jumping at small 
noises and a constant need to 
be in “survival mode.” I would 
exercise for hours, desperate to 
feel some sense of control over 
my body. After six months in 
treatment in 2016, after being 
nourished for long enough 
that my brain was working 
properly, 
I 
began 
having 
nightmares every night. I 
kept trying to say everything 
was fine, but my re-emerging 
restriction 
and 
exercise 
addiction said otherwise. I 
finally said, “Yes,” when my 
doctor asked me about abuse, 
and things spiraled from there.
My therapist found out and 
told me I needed to talk about 
it. I couldn’t. I froze, unable 
to speak every time I thought 
about it. I lived on steamed 
vegetables, 
convinced 
that 
everything else was “dirty,” 
and that if I ate “clean,” then I 
would finally feel clean again. 
I didn’t care that I was dying. I 
thought I would never get past 
this, and that the constant fear 
wasn’t worth living through. 
I 
barely 
slept 
between 
nightmares and hunger. My 
mom and doctor threatened 
me with a psychiatric hold 
and a court-ordered hospital 
stay if I didn’t voluntarily 
receive treatment. I stayed in 
a hospital for a week before a 
residential treatment center 
declared me medically stable 
enough to receive their care, 

and then had to go through 
the 
process 
of 
evaluation 
after evaluation, again. But 
I couldn’t pretend nothing 
had happened anymore. I still 
couldn’t talk or think about 
it much, but I tried getting a 
word out here or there about 
how it made me feel.
I returned to Michigan 
after that last treatment stay 
and still hadn’t dealt with the 
post-traumatic stress disorder. 
I still avoid the streets where 
things transpired. I won’t go 
to Pizza House because I went 
there one of those nights. I’ve 
done a decent job of avoiding 
the 
memories 
whenever 
possible, even though I still 
have nightmares every night. 
When the #MeToo movement 
started, I once again missed 
classes, but kept eating. When 
the Kavanaugh case hit the 
news, I felt so much anxiety 
that I couldn’t breathe unless 
I curled up in a ball and 
used a weighted blanket. 
I missed three classes in 
one week because I just 
couldn’t feel safe outside of 
my house. I go to therapy 
twice a week, and still freeze 
and have flashbacks when 
we approach the subject of 
those nights. The Kavanaugh 
case sent me spiraling. I’m 
finally beginning to actually 
try 
a 
form 
of 
trauma-
therapy called EMDR, or eye 
movement 
desensitization 
and 
reprocessing. 
I’m 
terrified. But the past four 
years of my life have been 
defined by these nights. 
I’m so tired of being tired 
from lack of sleep — tired 
of feeling like my body isn’t 
mine.
It’s hard being a survivor, 
right now. It’s hard calling 
myself a survivor. It’s hard 
being a survivor, period.
I’ve built up grounding 
skills 
— 
essential 
oils 
in 
silly 
putty, 
carefully 
crafted playlists, breathing 
exercises — to keep me 
present instead of spiraling 
into 
memories. 
There’s 
no neat end to this story, 
because this will probably 
still affect me for the rest of 
my life. But I’m hoping that 
I can get to a point where 
it’s part of my story, not the 
defining factor.

From 
enigmatic 
plot 
to 
disconcerting 
characters, 
normality is but a common thread 
in Katya Apekina’s debut novel, 
“The Deeper the Water the Uglier 
the Fish.” Coming from a mother 
who swallows her loved ones 
whole and a narcissistic father, two 
daughters are torn between the 
chaotic obsessions and depressions 
of their parents. After Edith and 
Mae’s mother, Marianne, attempts 
to hang herself they are taken 
under the wing of their father, 
Dennis — a former civil rights 
activist and glamorous author. The 
plot is a series of question marks 
and unsettling flashbacks that are 
gradually filled out by the tangle of 
narratives.
Turbulent 
and 
beautifully 
twisted, Apekina’s narrative ping-
pong 
game 
combines 
Edith’s 
present viewpoint with Mae’s 
retrospective 
future 
narration. 
Readers observe in discomfort 
the unraveling of each obsessively 
sinister relationship between parent 
and child. This charactorial tension 
is unsettling and glues your eyes to 
each passing word. Each character 
is layered with instabilities that 
compile and decompose. Alongside 
the instabilities of the other 
characters, they form a complex 
web of alluring destruction. The 
narrative is further peppered with 
psychiatric 
records, 
telephone 
conversations, letters and book 
reviews that provide backstage 
glances into the mental framework 

of each character.
Apekina 
employs 
a 
blend 
of 
perspective 
and 
shifting 
timeframes to propel the novel 
with stunning volatility. Edie’s 
chapters are dated with 1997, while 
much of the offhand excerpts are 

either dated from the ’60s or left 
completely undated. Many of the 
sideline excerpts are recited by 
witnesses like Dennis’s sister, Aunt 
Rose, his envious lover, Amanda, 
Edith’s new friend, Charlie, her 
recent boyfriend Markus and 
Cronus the cat. Each figure retells 
different pieces to this plot puzzle, 
and as the story unravels, so too 
does the mental stability of each 
character.
It’s almost easy to dismiss 
Marianne 
as 
a 
hallucinating, 
deranged 
women, 
but 
Edith’s 
determination 
to 
reclaim 
her 
mother’s name brings Marianne 
back into focus as a character of 
intrigue. At the same time there is 
ambiguity in the source of Edith’s 
hunger for her mother’s attention 
as she had always been the second-
place child in her mother’s eyes. 
Mae struggles to distance herself 
from 
Marianne’s 
possessive 
influence as she describes, “Yes, 
mom dragged me with her to every 
terrible place. I needed to get as 
far from her as I could. She was 

consuming me. That day she tried 
to hang herself from the rafter 
in the kitchen, I’d been lying on 
the bedroom floor. My mind was 
a radio tuned to her station and 
her misery paralyzed me.” Mae 
replaces her mother’s obsession 
with her own delusional infatuation 
with her father. Mae desires to fill 
his need for a damaged, unstable 
muse. As Marianne describes best 
Dennis “liked his birds with their 
wings broken.” Almost ironically, 
Mae slowly starts to embody her 
mother’s mannerisms and manic 
tendencies to become the not-so-
perfect muse for Dennis and is 
essentially consumed by insanity in 
the process.
Apekina 
asks 
an 
essential 
question: Whose voice gets to be 
heard? The famed father, a suicidal 
mother, two neglected daughters or 
the side characters who observe the 
chaos from a safe distance?
“The Deeper the Water the 
Uglier the Fish” exposes more 
than the inner workings of parent-
child relationships and the darker 
shades of mental illness, it digs into 
pressing themes of today’s political 
climate and the gendering of society. 
It provides a timely interpretation 
of the silencing and reinventing of 
voices through the power of men. 
Apekina perfectly plants seeds 
for respecting and believing the 
voices of women while leaving 
ambiguous gaps in the narrative for 
the reader’s interpretative delight. 
The story is left unresolved for a 
much-anticipated follow up novel, 
and it’s good timing: The world 
was far overdue for such a relevant, 
tantalizing and desirably addictive 
novel.

On the extended voice

At the beginning of Oct., I saw 
an unusual concert at Canterbury 
House. The School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance student ensemble 
Front Porch performed short sets 
with four singer-songwriters after 
collaborating on arrangements of 
their music. The group’s unusual 
instrumentation of violin, bassoon, 
percussion and piano can produce 
a surprising variety of colors, 
and it was interesting to see the 
diversity 
of 
the 
songwriters’ 
styles reflected in the differences 
in arrangement. Music usually 
backed by a guitar or a piano was 
expanded into music with evolving 
textures, 
symphonic 
flourishes 
and new countermelodies and 
embellishments.
One of the choices that the 
singers had to make was whether 
to use a microphone or not — 
amplification is the exception in 
the idiom that Front Porch plays in, 
but a norm in a good deal of popular 
music. Evan Chambers, who is 
also a professor of composition at 
SMTD, chose to go without for his 
set and managed to project over 
the ensemble just fine. Another 
performer, Hannah McPhilimy, 
chose to use a microphone. The 
stylistic divide between their two 
sets was somewhat reflected in 
this decision. Professor Chambers, 
whose songs are rooted in the 
folk revival and Irish music, 
projected over the ensemble at 
their loudest and was expressive 
physically. He moved his entire 
body with the music and at times 
conducted 
himself 
with 
both 
hands. Amplification would have 
been inappropriate for the style, but 
mostly it was just unnecessary.
McPhilimy’s 
set 
was 
more 
intimate 
and 
personal 
than 
Chambers’s, and her choreography 
was similarly in miniature. The 
microphone on a stand imposes 
its 
own 
choreography, 
which 
is 
necessarily 
smaller 
than 
performers 
who 
go 
without. 
Her hands played a primary 
“acting” role, moving slowly, at 
times grasping the stand as if for 
support or holding onto a dancing 

partner. The acoustic effect of the 
amplification was to make quiet 
sounds louder — an audience 
member could hear her inhale and 
sing softly.
Microphones include everything 
by default. Audio engineers have 
to set up special filters to remove 
plosives 
and 
sibilance 
from 
recording — little P and S sounds, 
respectively, that are magnified by 
the closeness of the microphone 
— and even with these filters, a 
microphone close on whatever it is 
recording will miss very little. This 
radical inclusiveness means that 
amplified performance and close-
miked recording includes a lot of 
details, of the kind only otherwise 
heard when the singer is very 
close. Tony Bennett said of Frank 
Sinatra that he “perfected the art 
of intimacy.” Sinatra’s recordings 
have a certain subtlety and detail — 
you can hear him ease in and trail 
off his phrases, even as a big band 
with trombones and saxophones 
plays behind him. His voice isn’t 
on stage. You, the listener, are not 
in the audience; he is across the 
table from you or walking up to you 
at a bar. Billie Holiday’s live shows 
from the ’40s and ’50s are similar 
— she rarely sings loudly, but can be 
clearly heard over the band.
Compare this style with St. 
Vincent’s 2007 “What Me Worry,” 
a pastiche of the midcentury 
crooning style (specifically echoing 
Holiday’s distinctive vocal timbre). 
Her voice is completely dry, and 
the sibilance is louder, sharper. The 
space between her voice and the 
listener has been collapsed from 
that of the crooners to a painfully 
small scale. The voice is in a totally 
different sonic world than the 
band, which is perhaps playing 
on TV in the background. This 
song is unusual in so specifically 
harkening back to the Crooners, 
and the microscopic vocal detail 
it offers the listener feels very out 
of place. Throughout the second 
half of the 20th century, with the 
radical improvement in recording 
capabilities, artists have used 
the 
microphone’s 
maximizing 
capabilities to extend the depth of 
their closeness to a surreal degree. 
The music of of FKA Twigs often 
contains vocal sounds that are 

somewhere between whispering 
and hissing. The singer-songwriter 
Liz Harris, professionally known 
as Grouper, makes music that 
almost puts the listener inside her 
voice. “Way They Crept,” from the 
2005 album of the same time, turns 
her voice into an enveloping drone.
Extending 
voices 
with 
amplification works both ways 
— both intimacy and a kind of 
outsized violence are possible. The 
use of microphones in performance 
and recording allows for the 
transformation from small sounds 
to loud, aggressive ones. So-called 
“mumble rap” employs a technique 
something like this. The clipping 
vocals of Lil Pump, literally created 
by pushing a digital system past its 
limits and recording the results, 
make the transformation of human 
to machine almost uncomfortably 
visceral. On “D Rose,” it doesn’t 
sound like he’s delivering his lines 
particularly loudly, but it’s intended 
to be played loudly — mumbling, 
paradoxically, over loud parties 
or festival audiences. His voice 
resembles the cartoonishly large 
jacket he wears in a recent music 
video with Kanye West, in that 
his actual body is dwarfed by its 
representation. This drastic degree 
of separation is only convincing in 
the electronic landscape that Lil 
Pump and his listeners live in. The 
recordings of the Crooners (and 
even, to an extent, St. Vincent’s 
pastiche of them) are, at least, 
simulations of live performance. 
The voices of mumble rappers 
are placed in juxtaposition with 
synthesizers, and audiences barely 
blink when, for example, Lil Uzi 
Vert’s voice is autotuned so far that 
the result is more mechanical than 
human.
But really, to emphasize the 
outsize 
artificiality 
of 
certain 
genres more than others is to 
distract from the fact that all 
recording is artificial. In a way, 
music that doesn’t use elaborate 
measures to obscure the means 
of its production is more honest 
about the nature of recorded music. 
The most captivating part of Lil 
Pump’s self-titled album is how 
much digital noise covers it. The 
computer it was made on enters the 
frame in a way it wouldn’t have if the

recording was left clean. In another 
direction, a lot of indie music has 
embraced a “lo-fi” aesthetic, which 
leaves in artifacts like fret sliding 
noises, sharp inhales and even 
sometimes the sound of moving 
objects around in the background. 
“Renee” by the Florida duo SALES 
has an almost messy guitar part, 
and there’s a thick layer of tape 
noise over the track that sounds 
like crickets from an open window. 

One of my favorite songs, “Blue 
Mountain Road,” from Florist’s 
second album, layers barely audible 
backing vocals with an unaltered 
guitar part. The vocalist, Emily 
Sprague, sings at a volume that 
would be appropriate if she were 
trying not to be heard downstairs 
first thing in the morning, and her 
voice is hard-panned, giving the 
impression of singing directly into 
her listeners’ ears. Listening to this 

music is a reminder of the event 
of its making. It tells the listener 
that the music was made at a 
specific time, with specific people. 
Listening to lo-fi music is often 
both a musical experience and a 
sort of bridge through time. Maybe 
that’s what all recording is.

‘Purple Plastic Purse’

I must have read “Lilly’s Purple 
Plastic Purse” upwards of 50 times 
as a kid. I loved it. I still do.
I think I gravitated to the book 
because I myself was a little like 
Lilly. I too was a precocious, strong-
willed, teacher’s pet with a burning 
love for red cowboy boots. I was 
so taken by the spunky character 
and her eponymous story that I 
managed to get my little hands on 
a purple plastic purse of my very 
own. Like Lilly, I adored that purse 
tremendously.
For those of you who have 
never read the picture book, or 
have forgotten its contents, the 
story is, at its heart, a simple 
redemption tale. We learn early 
on that Lilly is completely smitten 
with her teacher, Mr. Slinger. She 
loved that he wore his glasses on 
a chain around his neck, greeted 
his students by saying “howdy” 
and baked them curly, crunchy, 
cheesy snacks for before recess. 
She’s so taken by him that she 
proclaims that she too wants to be 
a teacher, and even pretends to be 
him at home, while giving her baby 
brother Julien a “lesson.”
However, things go awry when 

Lilly comes to school one Monday 
with the spoils of a shopping trip 
with grandma. She brings in 
her new “movie star sunglasses 
complete with glittery diamonds, 
and a chain like Mr. Slinger,” as 
well as “three shiny quarters” and, 
best of all, a “purple plastic purse 
that played a jaunty tune when 
opened.”
Like most little kids with a new 
toy, she just can’t wait to show it 
off. Only, Mr. Slinger has kindly 
asked her on multiple occasions 
to hold off and wait till recess or 
sharing time. But Lily just can’t 
help it, and in an outburst invites 
all her classmates to take a look. An 
unamused Mr. Slinger confiscates 
the purse.
Feeling hurt and betrayed, Lilly 
scrawls a hateful drawing of her 
teacher where she haughtily writes 
“P.S. I do not want to be a teacher 
when I grow up.” She tucks this 
note into his bag.
On her walk home from school, 
she discovers special snacks and 
a kind note from Mr. Slinger in 
her newly returned purse. She, of 
course, feels awful and banishes 
herself to the time-out chair when 
she gets home.
The very next morning she 
arrives extra early with an apology, 
baked-goods, a kind drawing and 
story of Mr. Slinger. Naturally, he 

forgives her and they proceed to 
have an amazing day. All is well.
My rehashing of the book does 
little to convey its magic. A lot of 
what makes “Lily’s Plastic Purse”— 
and all of Kevin Henkes books for 
that matter — so special lives in 
the illustrations. They’re skilled, 
playful and spirited. They add 
immense heart to the story.
But ultimately, the reason this 
book has stayed with me has little 
to do with its overall endearing 
message of forgiveness, but rather 
the specific content of Mr. Slinger’s 
note to Lily.
In it he writes: “Today was a 
difficult day. Tomorrow will be 
better.”
As far as writing goes, the 
phrase is hardly groundbreaking. 
And yet the phrase reverberates 
through my head when I’m feeling 
down on my luck.
I keep these words tucked in 
my pocket. Over the years they’ve 
become a personal mantra. When 
all has gone wrong and I catch 
myself crying at the end of a bad 
day I’ll whisper to myself Mr. 
Slingers’s words: “Today was a 
difficult day. Tomorrow will be 
better.” Invariably, those nine 
simple words provide me some 
relief. Even the toughest days come 
to an end, and tomorrow provides 
the opportunity of a fresh start.

BOOK REVIEW

5A — Friday, October 19, 2018
Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com


The Lydia Mendelssohn Theatre 
was buzzing with excitement, 
as the audience was antsy to see 
another spectacular performance 
put on by the University’s School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance (SMTD). 
The energy in the room bounced 
off the bright red curtain that fell 
so elegantly, covering the floral, 
colorful, ’60s flower-power set of 
“Sweet Charity.”
“Sweet Charity” is a musical 
based on an original screenplay by 
Frederico Fellini, written by comic 
playwright Neil Simon, with lyrics 
by Dorothy Fields and music by Cy 
Coleman. It debuted on Broadway 
in 1966, choreographed by the 
iconic Bob Fosse (known for the 
dance masterpieces “Cabaret” and 
“Chicago”). The show’s history 
boasts four-time Tony Award-
winning actress Gwen Verdon as 
one of its stars. Many tunes from 
“Sweet Charity” have made it 
into the mainstream, such as “Big 
Spender” and “If My Friends Could 
See Me Now.” 
The musical follows the story 
of a woman named Charity Hope 
Valentine, a dance-hall hostess 
who thirsts to find a partner who 
would not pay much mind to her 
taboo job. In comes skittish tax-
account, Oscar Lindquist, who 
seems to be Charity’s chance at 
love, at last. 
Charity Hope Valentine, the 
fun-loving dance hall hostess 
desperately searching for love, is 
played by Nevada Koenig, a senior 
BFA Musical Theatre major. Koenig 
displayed her dance skill with an 
impressive performance of the 
Fosse-inspired movements. While 
even some of the most experienced 
performers struggle with the subtle 
movements of the Bob Fosse style 
on the big stage, Koenig was able to 
successfully make every movement 
effective. She makes movement 
informed by the bubbly demeanor 
of Charity Hope Valentine. Fosse 

choreography lends itself to being 
sensual. However, Koenig put her 
own spin on the dance, making 
the movements appear innocent 
and playful. When the curtains 
open and we first see Charity, she 
uses movement to set the mood 
of the entire musical. It was truly 
incredible that Koenig could get 
the audience to giggle and laugh by 
using her witty movement.
Although Koenig’s movement 
was impressive, her performance 
lacked in acting skill, which was 
especially seen once the music 
stopped and transitioned into a 
scene. When she was left to be 
the character without the music 
backing her, Charity’s chipper 
demeanour greatly diminished 
and the energy sank. Without 
movement guiding Koenig, she 
became a less genuine actress. 
Her lines were not internalized, 
so when she delivered them, the 
performance came across as very 
rehearsed instead of playing with 
character development in the 
moment. This resulted in some 
comedic moments being washed 
over the audience. I left the theater 
without much of an impression of 
Charity. 
The 
energy 
that 
radiated 
off the stage came from the 
incredible 
ensemble 
members 
and supporting roles. One of the 
most impressive numbers was in 
the second act, “Rhythm of Life.” 
The ensemble filled the stage 
with extravagant hippie prints 
and a fun and contagious energy 
emanated from the stage. It was 
one of my favorite numbers of 
the entire show because of how 
much fun the cast was having, 
which transferred to the audience. 
Commodore Primous, who had a 
featured role as Daddy Brubeck, 
had an especially explosive and 
compelling performance, which 
was showcased in his interactions 
with other members of the cast 
during this number and his 
powerful movement. 
My favorite dance number 
was “Rich Man’s Frug.” The 

ensemble’s movements were sharp 
and effective, and this number 
showcased the incredible talent 
and versatility of the Department 
of Musical Theatre. I tremendously 
applaud 
Linda 
Goodrich, 
the 
choreographer of this production 
and associate professor in the 
Department of Musical Theatre, 
for her wonderful choreography. 
Throughout 
the 
entire 
show, 
I 
was 
thoroughly 
impressed 
with not only the execution of 
movement, but the creativity of the 
choreography. Goodrich was able 
to blend Fosse influence with her 
own personal style, which made 
the musical more accessible and 
fun to watch. It is worth buying 
tickets to see the movement for 
yourself. 
I was very impressed by the 
performances of Mikaela Secada, 
sophomore BFA Musical Theatre 
major 
and 
McKenzie 
Kurtz, 
senior BFA Musical Theatre, as 
Helene and Nickie, respectively. 
Helene and Nickie are dancers in 
the dance-hall that Charity works 
in, and they are Charity’s closest 
friends. Kurtz and Secada did an 
incredible job in embodying the 
sassiness and toughness of their 
characters, putting their own 
spins on them. Their authentic 
performance made them so much 
fun to watch. 
Another striking moment was 
when Blake Roman Bojewski, 
senior 
BFA 
Musical 
Theatre 
major, 
who 
played 
eccentric 
Italian moviestar Vittorio Vidale, 
opened his mouth to sing. His 
voice was incredibly enchanting. 
His performance of “Too Many 
Tomorrows” was moving and 
entrancing. His voice matched the 
hypnotizing smoothness of his 
character, as he showed off a more 
classical vocal style and color. 
SMTD’s Department of Musical 
Theatre, again, put on an enjoyable 
performance. 
“Sweet 
Charity” 
was a joy to watch, and I had a 
wonderful time marvelling at the 
great talent that we have right here 
on campus.

SMTD’s ‘Sweet Charity’ 
is a striking performance

Nike’s Air Max 720 takes 
steps toward the future

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

of energy — the sun rising over 
a black monolith, set by the 
sepia-toned haze of a sneaker 
market flooded with archival 
releases and lazy mash ups. 
Stanley 
Kubrick’s 
“2001: 
A Space Odyssey” explores 
the exciting new trajectories 
brought 
about 
by 
the 
technological 
age, 
while 
addressing fears of its sterile, 
objective 
rigidity; 
Nike’s 
environmentally 
conscious 
intentions with the shoe are 
an appeal to the former. Their 
assertions of eco-benevolence 
as a corporate mega giant 
are a press-friendly spin on 
confronting waste issues that 
have gone unchecked until 
recent years.
Expected to release on Air 
Max Day (Nike’s designated 
anniversary of the massively 
successful 
line, 
celebrated 
on Mar. 26th) of next year, 
the shoe’s credentials pack 
an 
undeniable 
punch. 
As 
purported by their website, 
the 720 will boast the largest 
heel of any sneaker in history, 
allowing 
for 
unparalleled 
comfort 
and 
agility 
for 
a 
trainer or a person that’s going 
to be trotting around midtown 
all day. Using their Vapormax 
technology, 
they 
removed 
the need for a foam midsole 
(a 
significant 
waste-causer 
that’s problematic across the 

industry) and crafted the shoe 
out of about 75% recycled 
materials. It should also be 
noted that Nike is committed 
to using dying processes for the 
shoe that allow for virtually no 
water pollution and upcycling 
about 95% of sourced materials. 
With yearly plastic production 
projected to clock in at over 
half a billion tonnes over the 
next few decades, the eco-
friendly race within sneaker 
and fashion communities is 
no longer just about feel-good 
PR or appealing to a vocal 
minority. 
It should go without saying 
that reckless industry and 
consumerism has run up a 
tab on the environment that 
may not be easily paid off. 
According to a recent study at 
MIT, the average lightweight 
running shoe (like the ones 
that, according to a tweet 
by Matt Powell, Nike sells 
at a rate of about 25 per 
second) produces almost 30 
pounds of carbonic waste and 
existing processes are greatly 
contributing to the plastic 
barge in the ocean that will 
outweigh the total underwater 
life count in terms of weight by 
2050. Currently at its zenith 
with about 20 billion pairs of 
shoes coming off the line each 
year, “drop” culture and its 
perpetrators have an ethical 

responsibility 
to 
implement 
procedures that reduce waste 
from the standpoint of both 
material and the construction 
itself. 
While they may not be 
leading that charge, the Air 
Max 720 is a powerful step 
forward. In light of the IPCC’s 
recent 
report 
indicating 
that a concerted effort will 
have to be made in order to 
prevent 
permanent 
damage 
do the environment over the 
next century, it’s heartening 
to 
see 
titans 
of 
industry, 
like 
Nike, 
create 
products 
that acknowledge the dire 
circumstances under which 
contemporary industries are 
working. The introduction of 
new technology (coupled with, 
hopefully, 
a 
slower-paced 
sneaker release calendar in 
coming years) that is attractive, 
ethical and sustainable from 
the 
market’s 
leader 
will 
undoubtedly have an impact 
on future developments from 
competitors as well as habits 
of the consumer. The 21st 
century may be sold separately 
from a Pan Am sponsored 
trip to Jupiter or AI that has 
a pragmatic take on human 
life, but Nike’s retro-futuristic 
installment of footwear will at 
least have the aesthetic chops 
to sit next to those fabulous 
Djinn chairs. 

STYLE REVIEW

REPRISE RECORDS

“I know, no one’s going to 
show me everything / We all 
come and go unknown / Each so 
deep and superficial / Between 
the forceps and the stone.”
This 
is 
my 
favorite 
line 
from 
Joni 
Mitchell’s 
entire 
discography. It’s part of the 
title track off her 1974 album 
Hejira, a record full of longing 
and grit and beauty that is often 
overlooked in the great scape of 
her work at large. But it’s this 
line, this articulation of the 
uncertainty of life, that has stuck 
with me from the first time I 
heard it. Above everything she 
has done, Mitchell’s haunting 
voice captures the calm that 
comes 
from 
understanding 
the 
simultaneous 
grandeur 
and microcosm of the human 
experience. We are both deep 
and superficial, all unknown, all 
in limbo between birth and death 
at any given moment. In this 
statement, I have found strength 
and calm throughout some of 
the most difficult periods of 
my life. The relationship I have 
with Joni Mitchell has changed 
over the years, but ultimately 
it comes down to that line, and 
the message it represents carries 
across much of her work: No 
matter who you are, what you 
do, or where you go, we are all 
here together, and we might as 
well find something deeper in 
the world around us. As a young 
woman growing up in a time 
where it’s sometimes hard to 
find the truth in popular music, 
Mitchell offered a sense of 
perspective on a larger scale, and 
for that, I will always be grateful.
Anyone who has ever had a 
conversation about music with 
me knows I love Joni; she is 
a puzzle and a master at the 
same time, an artist who has 
taught me more than even she 
could understand. Though I 
grew up with Mitchell’s hits 
like “California” and “River” 
playing throughout my house, 
it wasn’t until I had some of my 
own life experiences that I could 
truly appreciate her genius. I 
discovered her fully in the first 
few years of high school, which 

were arguably some of the 
darkest times I’ve been through. 
Being a teenage girl can often 
feel like a living nightmare, and 
I dealt with both chronic illness 
and depression on top of that. 
During those rough years, Joni 
was a friend, a mother and a 
prophet for me in a period where 
I desperately needed something 
to hold onto. For me at that point, 
Joni Mitchell’s music was both 
a salve and a lens to see myself 
through, an aid in understanding 
that accepting the future as it is 

provides more than trying to fix 
it in place.
Mitchell’s own story serves as 
a perfect example of strength and 
success in spite of a difficult past: 
She had a baby at 20 and gave her 
up, a choice alluded to in Blue’s 
“Little Green.” She went through 
a divorce at an incredibly young 
age, stood back up and became 
an unstoppable force in modern 
folk music. She is revered not 
only for her incredible talent for 
lyrics and music, but also her 
uncanny ability to synthesize her 
own experiences into universally 
applicable narratives. At the 
foundation of Mitchell’s work 
is a rock-solid sense of self, 
something that everyone who 
listens to her music cannot 
ignore. 
The 
songwriter 
has 
always known who she was, 
and while I was trying to find 
my own identity, her steadfast 
analysis of the toils and joys of 
her own life gave me hope that 
I would one day understand 
myself. I recommend her music 
to every young girl because of 
this: Though it may seem dense 

or weird at first, Mitchell’s heart 
is clearly in everything she has 
made, and a shining example of 
how vulnerability can be just as 
powerful as defense.
While that era of my life 
is fortunately over and I am 
happier 
and 
healthier 
than 
I’ve ever been, I firmly believe 
that the lessons I learned from 
Mitchell’s 
throughout 
those 
struggles will stay with me for 
a very long time. There’s a song 
on her third record Ladies of 
the Canyon called “The Circle 
Game” that details the cyclical 
nature of life, explaining that 
“We’re captive on the carousel 
of time / We can’t return we can 
only look behind / From where 
we came / And go round and 
round and round / In the circle 
game.” Here, Mitchell comments 
on the value of looking behind 
at the past to understand the 
present and future, something 
that serves as a window to much 
of her work. In every album that 
she has written, the singer takes 
stories from her own life and 
observations from the world 
around her and turns them into 
proverbs for the years to come.
We have all been at a party 
sitting by ourselves (“People’s 
Parties,” 
Court 
and 
Spark), 
watched mundane life with 
awe (“The Hissing of Summer 
Lawns,” The Hissing of Summer 
Lawns) or felt misunderstood 
by romantic partners (“Woman 
of Heart and Mind,” For the 
Roses). 
In 
these 
narratives, 
Mitchell taught me resilience 
and patience with myself and my 
idea of the future. Though it is 
easy to rush through your days 
with an intense focus, it is in 
noticing the beauty and sadness 
of life that we can learn the most. 
Joni Mitchell’s music serves as a 
book of parables if you look hard 
enough, all set to piano, guitar 
and her singular voice. For those 
who have never listened to her, I 
offer this to you: Be ready to open 
your heart and mind, because 
fully understanding Mitchell is 
impossible, but trying will teach 
you more about yourself than 
you would ever expect.

Joni and I

Let it go

H

opefully, by now, 
you’ve regained 
your senses after the 
Michigan 
hockey team’s 
roller-coaster 
of a season 
last year.
The 
Wolverines 
started in 
the shadow 
of Red 
Berenson’s 
retirement 
and low 
expectations, struggled to 
escape the darkness until 
mid-January, then finished 
seconds away from a spot in 
the National Championship 
game. Not to mention this all 
happened in Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson’s first season 
running the team.
Last season certainly 
assured the Wolverines that 
rebuilding didn’t mean a long 
road back to relevance. On the 
other hand, Michigan’s 4-3 
loss at the horn to Notre Dame 
in the Frozen Four semifinals 
gave the program arguably its 
toughest lost in recent history 
— and a bad taste in its mouth 
going into the offseason.
Pearson knows that the 
tables are turned this year. The 
Wolverines are not sneaking 
up on anyone anytime soon — 
they started this season ranked 
No. 4 in the country — and 
although they haven’t looked 
as sharp as one would expect 
a preseason top-
five team to look, 
the target is on 
the Wolverines’ 
back. They 
are no longer 
the hunters. 
Michigan is the 
hunted.
“You’ve got 
something to 
prove still,” 
Pearson said. “If 
you’re picked to finish lower 
like you were, you’re trying to 
prove that they were wrong 
and that we have a better team 
than whoever picks the polls. If 
you’re picked high, then you’re 
trying to prove that those 
people know what they’re 
talking about ... You have to 

go from they don’t know what 
they’re talking about to being 
like, ‘OK they’re right.’”
And while that umbrella 
covers the general 
expectations of 
a team that just 
made the Frozen 
Four, Michigan 
still wants to 
prove, at least in 
some ways, that 
“those people” 
don’t know 
quite know what 
they’re talking 
about.
On paper, 
much has changed from last 
season to now. The top-line 
combination of Dexter Dancs, 
Cooper Marody and Tony 
Calderone — and all 122 of 
its net-shredding points — 
are gone. But who expected 
anything out of them when 
Michigan finished 13-19-3 the 

season before?
Sophomore Josh Norris 
returned to Ann Arbor despite 
being a first-round pick in the 
2017 NHL Entry Draft. He 
could be the new offensive 
ringleader. Same goes for 
sophomore defenseman Quinn 
Hughes, who was drafted 7th 
overall last season. He could 
surely be in the NHL right 
now, but he too returned with 
high expectations.
Junior Will Lockwood is 
back from a season-ending 
injury. Junior Nick Pastujov 
and his brother, sophomore 
Michael Pastujov, have shown 
flashes, albeit not for long 
enough to firmly establish 
themselves as forces quite yet. 
The recipe for success is not a 
quick one, and there may well 
be a lot of growing pains for 
the group.
Michigan seems to 
understand that. It’s why, even 

through a rough defensive 
start to the season and a slew 
of untimely turnovers, Pearson 
has remained level-headed 
about the flow of the offense, 
his blue line and 
the goaltender 
situation.
Success, be it 
over the course 
of a game, a 
season or a 
coaching era, 
is not a sprint. 
Even Berenson 
didn’t finish 
above .500 until 
his fourth season 
coaching the Wolverines and 
didn’t make a Frozen Four 
until his eighth. In one season 
behind the bench at Michigan, 
Pearson did both.
Reveling in their Cinderella 
run won’t help the Wolverines 
when they have to face No. 1 
Ohio State, which swept them 

last year and hardly lost any 
talent. Neither will sulking 
about the Frozen Four defeat 
to Notre Dame when they first 
gear up against the second-
ranked Fighting 
Irish.
Those things 
happened then, 
but this is now. 
Pearson and 
the Wolverines 
didn’t let 
poor prior 
expectations 
and following in 
the footsteps of 
a legend cloud 
their thoughts then, so why do 
the same now?
It’s time for Michigan to 
forget about last season, and 
enjoy the ride ahead.

Hayden Lavigne: No longer a mystery

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Written by Tien Le

H

ayden Lavigne 
is 
currently 

reading a mys-
tery 
book. 
It 

should come to 
no one’s sur-

prise, though. After all, he’s a mys-
tery himself.

Talk to people around Lavigne 

and two common themes emerge. 
One is that he’s a serious, intense 
guy. Two is that no one can ever 
tell what he’s thinking — he’s just 
an enigma.

“He’s very closed book, he’s very 

— he doesn’t show a lot of emotions, 
he doesn’t reveal a lot about him-
self,” said Lavigne’s mother Julie. 
“He can be taken the wrong way 
sometimes, he doesn’t show excite-
ment, it used to drive me nuts. 
Like, ‘Aren’t you excited?’ ‘Yeah, 
I’m excited.’ He doesn’t outwardly 
show it.”

As Michigan coach Mel Pearson 

puts it, “You win, there’s Hayden. 
You lose, there’s Hayden.”

And it’s hard for the goalie to 

express himself. His emotions are 
stashed under a mask and his body 
language locked away in a stance. 
But, if you want to know what he’s 
feeling, all you have to do is just 
ask.

“Other guys will give you an 

answer,” said goaltender coach 
Steve Shields. “And they’ll make 
sure it’s something that’s an accept-
able answer, but Hayden will just 
say what he feels. He’s real.”

A few years back, National Hock-

ey League goaltender coach Mitch 
Korn, now coaching his 27th year, 
came to Michigan to talk with the 
team. He gave them the regular 
spiel on the league. But then he 
asked, “Why do you think you’re 
going to be in the NHL one day?”

The team answered with the 

answers everyone wanted to hear, 
the ones that wouldn’t spark any 
controversy if overheard. But Lavi-
gne made his intent clear.

He responded simply: “I don’t 

know; I just know I will.”

***
Hayden Lavigne was born April 

7, 1996 in Brampton, Ontario.

From a young age — three-years-

old — he made up his mind on 
what he wanted to do. He let his 
mom know that he wanted to be 
on skates, that he wanted to play 
hockey.

Despite catching her off guard, 

not knowing where that desire 
came from, Julie tried to get him 
on a team. But being decisive didn’t 
get Lavigne any favors, it was too 
late for him by the time she found 
people his age on a team.

“I know some kids who started 

when they were four, I think by the 
time I asked they were full and they 
wouldn’t take him,” Julie said.

So when Lavigne turned five, his 

mother took him one more time to 
try and join a recreational team. 
At this point in his 
childhood, he had 
to make a decision. 
He dabbled in snow-
boarding and biking 
but Julie thought it 
was time he chose 
one sport to focus 
on.

“Even when he 

was young, he had 
to choose what he 
was gonna focus on 
because any rec sport, you can’t 
do more than one rec sport,” Julie 
said. “There’s not enough hours in 
the day.”

Around the same time he chose 

hockey, Lavigne fell in love with 
being a goaltender.

Lots of players don’t choose to be 

a goalie by default. Many find that 
it’s due to a gear — the ability to be 
different as Shields noted. Others 
find it due to a lack of staking abili-
ty. But for Lavigne, it was different.

“Now the best athletes are the 

goalies,” Shields said. “Lots of goal-
ies had a similar thing, where they 
had a chance to play when they 
were younger or they really, some 
kids just like that position. You 
don’t think about that when you’re 
young, and you’re out there playing 
goal and stopping pucks.”

And it’s as simple as that. Lavi-

gne didn’t find out about the gears 
or the pressure until later. He 

just loved being goalie because he 
thought it gave him the best chance 
to win.

“He perceived that winning was 

under his control,” Julie said. “So, 
it was easy. Just stop the pucks.”

Then, she said her and Jeff Lavi-

gne, Hayden’s father, actively tried 
to convince him to switch. See-
ing other hockey parents doing 
the same with their children only 
offered assurance. But Lavigne 
stuck with the position.

The decision was largely to the 

credit of a coach of a six-year-old 
rec team.

“(He) saw him playing once and 

said he wanted him as the goalie,” 
Julie said. “Saw him play once as 
the goalie. Like, at five years old, 

they had to rotate it, 
but I remember that 
the coach of the rec 
team (watched) the 
five year olds play 
and said, ‘I want him 
as my goalie.’

“And I said, ‘Well, 

could he come try 
out as a player?’ And 
he said, ‘Well, he 
could, but I really 
want him as my goal-

ie.’ I said, ‘You saw him play once 
and he doesn’t even get a shot!’ I 
mean, they could hardly skate! He 
goes, ‘Yes, he was very focused.’ So 
I said, ‘Okay.’ But anyway, that was 
the start of it. He wanted it and the 
coach wanted him so that was how 
he started.”

Lavigne differed from most of his 

teammates though. For one, he had 
other hobbies outside of hockey.

“When you’re in minor hockey, 

it’s hockey 24/7, seven days a week, 
four weeks a month, twelve months 
a year, almost,” Julie said. “And I 
think people, some people, will say, 
‘You gotta get off the ice, you gotta 
do other things,’ but when you’re 
going to minor hockey and every-
body’s doing it, you kind of just do 
it.”

Minor hockey is an amatuer 

league just below juniors, and yet 
despite being less competitive in 
nature than most of the other hock-

ey leagues, it was serious enough to 
warrant national tournaments and 
regional championships.

So while many dedicated most 

of their time to the sport, Lavigne 
found his time divided between 
other things he loved. Jeff would 
take him out to hunt at an early age 
and developed a love of the out-
doors.

Lavigne enjoyed games of tags 

while continuing to snowboard, 
hunt and mountain bike, despite 
pleas from his coaches.

But when he approached the age 

of ten, he faced a similar decision 
to the one he saw when he was five. 
But this time, it carried a lot more 
weight. He was contemplating giv-
ing up hockey for a bit to try com-
petitive snowboarding. Julie told 
him he couldn’t

“He toyed with giving up hockey 

for a year, just because, you can’t 
do both competitive sports,” Julie 
said. “But, like any other athlete, 
they’re really good at almost any 
sport they try, right?

“So, he toyed with wanting to 

be a pro snowboarder as well, or a 
competitive snowboarder, but he 
decided to stick with hockey in case 
— there’s a risk, right?”

The risk of injuries are always 

present, but it was the risk of lag-
ging behind that threatened Lavi-
gne the most.

“You leave one sport to do anoth-

er and then you wanna come back 
and all of the sudden you can’t get 
in at the same level,” Julie said. 
“And it would probably be true with 
hockey.”

So in order to keep up with his 

peers and to minimize the risk of 
injury, Lavigne gave up two of his 
hobbies for good. No more Christ-
mas-time snowboarding or sum-
mer-time mountain biking.

It left a hole in Lavigne — even 

with more time dedicated to hock-
ey. But, when he moved up to the 
junior hockey level, he adopted a 
new hobby — fishing.

“I got into it my first year in the 

USHL,” Lavigne said. “We were 
done playing pretty early and I had 
to stay down there to finish high 

school, and there were a lot of small 
ponds and not really a whole lot 
to do because we were in a really 
small town in Nebraska, so I kind 
of got into fishing that way.”

For a goalie, patience is a large 

aspect of the game. Move too early, 
and the attacking opponent could 
have an empty net to score on. 
Move too late, and the reaction to 
the puck might not be on time. So 
by picking up fishing, an activ-
ity that relies heavily on patience, 
Lavigne used it to better his skills 
on the ice.

But the hobby held a higher 

importance than just improving an 
aspect of his game.

“I think more than my patience, 

it’s helped me relax on the ice and 
realize that it’s just a game. I tend 
to get very tense and frustrated, 
and fishing was kind of a big out-
let for me and how to just kinda let 
that go,” Lavigne said. “Like when I 
was on the water, it was like, ‘Okay, 
well I don’t have to do anything 
except fish.’ ”

Adopting the hobby during his 

first year in the USHL might have 
been a stroke of luck. The first sea-
son with the Tri-City Storm, to 
put it lightly, was rough for Lavi-
gne. He underperformed, splitting 
time with Jacob Johansson. Post-
ing a subpar .895 save-percentage 
through 27 games, he was shad-
owed by Johansson’s .910 through 
42 games.

“Fishing kinda filled that void,” 

Lavigne said, “and gave me an 
opportunity to be outside and enjoy 
the weather and the scenery and all 
that stuff and still keep me occu-
pied without worrying about fall-
ing and breaking my arm or leg.”

If fishing was needed during a 

mentally-taxing first season, it was 
needed even more so through his 
second season in the league, when 
he went to the Waterloo Black 
Hawks. Faced with tighter compe-
tition after being cut from Tri-City 
— this time seeing a four-man rota-
tion at the position — Lavigne was 
given less time in the net, and sub-
sequently, the team saw less from 
him. Posted .866 save-percentage 

“He can be 
taken the 
wrong way 
sometimes.”

Hayden Lavigne: No longer a mystery

through 16 games, Lavigne’s per-
formance 
proved 
uninspiring, 

especially with his competition 
including the current Mike Rich-
ter Award winner and Notre Dame 
goalie, Cale Morris, who posted a 
.937 through 28 games.

“When I was in the USHL, I got 

cut from Tri-City and then Water-
loo, which was a big low in my 
career and probably the lowest 
I’ve ever been,” Lavigne said. “And 
then going into Bloomington, I had 
a great goalie coach that I got to 
work with there who really kinda 
turned my game around and helped 
me realize the mental aspect of 
things.”

If you didn’t know what type of 

goalie Lavigne was, he was always 
on the athletic side of the puck. His 
struggles were all mental.

“I would collapse on myself and 

get frustrated with myself,” Lavi-
gne said. “And so (the Bloomington 
Thunder goalie coach) helped me 
work through that, and that was 
a big turning point, but that was a 
year and a half long span of working 
with him and working through that 
stuff — that was big for me.”

The situation Lavigne saw in 

Bloomington wasn’t that far from 
what he saw in Michigan last year. 
After the first month, where he sat 
behind Logan Halladay, he dedi-
cated his time to developing. No 
games, just practice. It gave him 
time to fully accept that the start-
ing job wasn’t just going to fall 
to him, that he had to work hard 
against the competition out there 
to win it.

Even after he got his starts, he 

saw his time split in rotations. But 
that prepared him.

“Then finally got my starts, we 

rotated for almost a full year, we 
rotated,” Lavigne said. “That kinda 
really just set me up for the com-
petition that’s ahead and going in 
— coming in here, freshman year, 
there was four of us. I was com-
peting with not only just one other 
goalie, now I was competing with 
three others. Then last year, Jack 
LaFontaine and I were competing 
neck and neck for the first half of 

the season. This year, it’s (Strauss 
Mann) and (Jack Leavy) again.

Through every start, Lavigne 

gained pieces of him that would 
define how he played. Defining 
moments of his career taught him 
lessons as a player bit by bit, allow-
ing him to be the undisputed starter 
and late-season star the Wolverines 
needed from him last season.

“Even just my first game at Yost, 

playing and winning, just knowing 
that right away that I could com-
pete at this level was something 
that definitely gave me the confi-
dence through the last two years 
and 
moving 
forward,” 
Lavigne 

said. “Those are probably the big-
gest things, and like I said, it’s little 
things along the way. Going to the 
Frozen Four is a big turning point, 
shows not only me, but the whole 
team, what we can do.”

And it was by getting faster, bet-

ter and more consistent that Lavi-
gne found himself winning the 
starting job at Michigan.

As a freshman, he averaged a ser-

viceable .912 save percentage, with 
a 6-6-1 split through 13 games. It 
was as a sophomore, however, that 
he proved himself worthy of the 
starting job.

After a weak stretch in the first 

half of the year, where neither him 
or former Michigan goaltender 
Jack LaFontaine could separate 
one another, Lavigne was given the 
starting job after LaFontaine let six 
goals in against Bowling Green on 
Jan. 1st. And when given the oppor-
tunity this time around, he ran 
away with it.

On Feb. 2, Lavigne held his own 

against a ranked Wisconsin team, 
allowing only three goals in on 40 
shots. His goaltending made all the 
difference in a one-goal win, end-
ing 4-3 in favor of Michigan.

Against Penn State, Minnesota 

and Notre Dame, Lavigne averaged 
a .947 save percentage during the 
crucial stretch, cementing his place 
in the crease.

So while Lavigne might have 

been a mystery before, he’s made 
sure everyone knows just who is 
behind the mask.

Big Ten Breakdown: Entire conference hoping to maintain 
success of last season, when three teams made Frozen Four

When the No. 11 Michigan 
hockey team starts Big Ten 
play against Notre Dame three 
weeks from now, it will have a 
chance at redemption. In last 
year’s Frozen Four semifinal, 
a last-second Fighting Irish 
goal ended the Wolverines’ 
tournament 
run 
and 
their 
surprisingly successful season. 
But with Notre Dame ranked as 
the No. 2 team in the country, 
that chance at redemption may 
be a tall order for Michigan.
After 
the 
opening 
series 
against 
the 
Fighting 
Irish, 
the Wolverines’ Big Ten slate 
doesn’t get any easier. Three 
of last year’s four Frozen 
Four teams came from the 
conference — the Wolverines, 
Ohio State and Notre Dame.
And the Big Ten is poised to 
be a talent-filled conference 
again throughout the 2018-19 
season. Six of the seven teams 
are currently ranked inside the 
top 15 in the USCHO poll, with 
four teams in the top 10.
With 
that 
much 
talent 
in a single conference, the 
competition will be intense 
from now until March. The 
Daily takes a look at each of the 
teams in the Big Ten.

No. 1 Ohio State

After reaching the Frozen 
Four for the first 
time in 20 years 
last season, the 
Buckeyes 
(2-0) 
are 
set 
for 
a 
similarly strong 
year.
They returned 
75 
percent 
of 
their 
scoring, 
led by forwards 
Mason 
Jobst, 
Tanner 
Laczynski and Dakota Joshua. 
Jobst is the NCAA’s active-
leading scorer, having notched 
128 points — 52 of them goals 
— in his three years in an Ohio 
State sweater.
Last year’s Buckeye defense 
had 
the 
top 
penalty-kill 

percentage 
in 
the 
nation, 
preventing 
their 
opponents 
from scoring on .894 percent 
of their chances, and ranked 
third in goals allowed per game 
with 2.1. With just two goals 
allowed through the first two 
games, the Ohio State defense 
— headlined by 
Wyatt 
Ege 
— 
appears 
poised 
for another year 
of 
high-level 
performances.

No. 2 Notre 
Dame

In their first 
year in the Big 
Ten, the Fighting 
Irish (1-0-1) made quite the 
impression on the rest of the 
conference. They lost just six 
conference 
games, 
winning 
the regular season title by 
eight points, and defeated the 
Buckeyes in overtime for their 
first Big Ten championship.

After losing the National 
Championship to Minnesota-
Duluth, Notre Dame surely 
has motivation to reach the 
pinnacle this year. And with 
the return of the Big Ten Player 
of the Year and a top-10 Hobey 
Baker finalist in goaltender 
Cale 
Morris, 
the 
Fighting 
Irish’s defense shouldn’t have 
much to worry about.
At forward, Notre Dame 
has been led by Cal Burke and 
Bobby Nardella in the first 
two games. Burke’s three goals 
in the third period against 
Mercyhurst 
allowed 
the 
Fighting Irish to rally and tie 
the game at six goals before 
earning a shootout victory.

No. 7 Minnesota

The Golden Gophers (1-0-
1) opened the 2018-19 season 
with 
a 
series 
against 
the 
team that kept them from 
the NCAA Tournament last 
season, 
Minnesota-Duluth. 

The Bulldogs edged Minnesota 
by just 0.001 points in the 
Pairwise rankings, leaving the 
Golden Gophers on the outside 
looking in.
Minnesota has a new head 
coach, Bob Motzko, which sets 
up some uncertainty in the 
early going of the 
year. The Golden 
Gophers 
have 
two 
talented 
goaltenders 
to 
choose from in 
Mat Robson, who 
was 
named 
to 
the watch list for 
the Mike Richter 
award, and Eric 
Schierhorn, who 
was 
Big 
Ten 
Goaltender of the Year two 
years ago.
On offense, Minnesota will 
have to replace forward Casey 
Mittlestadt, who departed for 
the Buffalo Sabres. Forwards 
Brannon McManus and Sampo 
Ranta have emerged as the 

leading scorers thus far, but 
time will tell if they can 
replace Mittlestadt’s 30-point 
performance from last season.

No. 10 Penn State

After making their second-
straight 
NCAA 
Tournament 
last season, the 
Nittany 
Lions 
(2-0) are seeking 
to 
improve 
on 
their 
Midwest 
regional loss to 
Denver and make 
it farther in the 
postseason.
But 
with 
the 
loss 
of 
one of their top forwards, 
Andrew Sturtz, and a pair of 
talented defensemen in Trevor 
Hamilton 
and 
Erik 
Autio, 
Penn State will need to find 
replacements — and quickly — 
for those key players. Forwards

Brandon Biro and Nate Sucese 
have so far looked the part 
of replacements to Sturtz’s 
production with four points 
each in two games.
On 
the 
penalty 
kill 
in 
the opening series against 
Clarkston, the Nittany Lions 
allowed just two power-play 
goals in five chances. Penn 
State’s power play, on the 
other hand, has scored on 50 
percent of its opportunities.
 
No. 15 Wisconsin

The 
Badgers 
(2-0) 
are 
in rebound mode after last 
season’s loss to Michigan in 
the Big Ten Tournament and 
their 
subsequent 
missing 
of the NCAA Tournament. 
Wisconsin lost six straight 
conference games to finish 
the 2017-18 season, including 
the two losses in the Big Ten 
Tournament.
After 
sweeping 
Boston 
College to open the season, 
Wisconsin 
jumped 
from 
unranked to No. 15 in the 
USCHO poll. Goaltender Jack 
Berry 
had 
a 
rollercoaster 
weekend, 
as 
he 
shut 
out 
the Eagles in one game and 
allowed five goals on 28 shots 
in the other.
The Badgers’ offense seems 

to have found its rhythm, 
scoring 10 goals across the 
two games. Forward Tarek 
Baker paces the team with 
four points on the season, and 
forward Wyatt Kalnuk — a 
unanimous preseason All-Big 
Ten selection — has added 
three points of his own.

Michigan State

After finishing last in the 
Big Ten for the third straight 
season in 2017-18, with just six 
conference wins, the Spartans 
(1-1) are in the most trouble of 
any Big Ten team. Michigan 
State was once again picked 
to fall to the bottom of the 
heap in the 2018-19 preseason 
poll, so improvement may be 
minimal.
Last season, the Spartans 
managed to score just 91 goals 
— the worst scoring offense 
in the Big Ten. Forward Taro 
Hirose is expected to help 
increase that tally after being 
one of six unanimous All-Big 
Ten 
preseason 
selections. 
With three points in just 
the first two games, Hirose 
should 
help 
the 
Michigan 
State offense find its rhythm.
Beyond the top line of 
Hirose, Mitchell Lewandoski 
and 
Patrick 
Khodorenko, 
offensive 
depth 
and 
experience is a question for 
the Spartans, who have just 
three seniors on the roster.
Through one game and two 
exhibitions this season, the 
No. 11 Michigan hockey team 
(0-1) has been enigmatic. The 
expectations are high coming 
off a Frozen Four appearance 
last 
spring. 
However, 
the 
Wolverines dropped two of 
their first three games and 
have been outscored, 12-15.
The 
team 
welcomes 
10 
freshmen 
and 
returns 
17 
letter winners. Where the 
newcomers will fit in with 
the returning skaters and how 
they will fill the void left by 
the departed skaters remains 
to be seen.
The high-scoring top line 
of 
Dexter 
Dancs, 
Cooper 
Marody and Tony Calderone 
is no more. The trio combined 
for 122 of the team’s 363 
points last season — over 
one-third 
of 
Michigan’s 
offensive 
production. 
Now, 
the Wolverines will have to 
search for a new source of fuel 
for scoring the puck in the 
2018-2019 season.

In 
what 
has 
been 
a 
disappointing 
start 
by 
Michigan hockey standards, 
the team is searching for 
consistency 
on 
the 
roster. 
The return of several key 
players such as sophomore 
Quinn Hughes, senior Joseph 
Cecconi 
and 
junior 
Will 
Lockwood figure to uphold the 
framework of a powerhouse 
that the team reestablished in 
the second half of last season. 
The early struggles thus far 
are shaking the foundations 
of the powerhouse. However, 
the potential on the roster 
cannot be overlooked as the 
Wolverines begin their quest 
for another deep tournament 
run.
The Daily breaks down the 
2018-2019 roster.
Goaltenders
Hayden Lavigne is likely to 
get the nod as the starter given 
his status as the only non-
freshman goaltender on the 
roster. The junior recorded 
a .908 save percentage last 
season with a record of 18-11. 
However, in his two starts 
this season he has struggled, 

allowing at least five goals in 
each contest. In his second 
start, against the U.S. National 
Team Development Program, 
he was pulled in the second 
period in favor of freshman 
Straus Mann.
Mann looked solid in relief 
of Lavigne, allowing one goal 
in the subsequent 38 minutes 
of the contest. His first and 
only start against Waterloo 
got off to a rough start after 
allowing a goal on a bouncing 
puck from center ice. Since 
that moment, however, he has 
shown flashes of brilliance 
in the crease. The two will 
likely split time in the crease 
with Lavigne getting the edge 
based on prior experience 
and his performances in last 
season’s games.
Freshman Jack Leavy has 
not yet made his debut but 
is an imposing figure in the 
net with a 6-foot-5 frame. It 
is unclear how much playing 
time he will receive, but at the 
very least, he adds depth to the 
roster as the third goaltender.

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily
Sophomore forward Will Lockwood was the second-highest scorer for Michigan in the 2016-17 season but suffered a season-ending shoulder injury last year. Now he has returned to the Wolverines’ lineup.

pairing of Hughes and Cecconi 
is returning for this season. 
Both had the option of making 
the move to the NHL but chose 
to remain in Ann Arbor for 
another 
go-around. 
Hughes 
led the blueliners in points last 
season with 29 — edging out 
Cecconi by two points.
The defense is returning four 
other skaters in addition to 
Hughes and Cecconi. Juniors 
Luke Martin, Griffin Luce, 
Christian Meike, and senior 
Nicholas Boka add a level of 
continuity to the Wolverines’ 
defense.

The loss of Cutler Martin 
and Sam Piazza to graduation is 
met by the arrival of freshmen 
Jack Summers, Jake Gingell 
and Nick Blankenburg. All 
three have received ice time 
thus far, but only Blankenburg 
played 
in 
the 
team’s 
one 
regular season game.
Through 
three 
games 
this season, the defense has 
allowed at least four goals in 
each contest.
Forwards
The 
dissolution 
of 
the 
“DMC” line may be the biggest 
void for Michigan to fill.
The Wolverines’ 10 returning 
forwards 
will 
tackle 
the 
challenge. Thus far, sophomore 
Jack Becker is pacing the team 
with four goals through three 

games and figures to be a 
major contributor on offense.
Junior 
Jake 
Slaker 
and 
Lockwood have also found 
the back of the net early 
this season. The former has 
improved on his point total in 
each of his first two seasons. 
Slaker and Lockwood ranked 
one and two, respectively, in 
points during the 2016-2017 
season as freshmen. Lockwood 
had his 2017-2018 campaign 
cut short due to injury but is 
back on the ice, while Slaker 
finished third in goals with 15 
and tied for fifth in points with 
27. They will need to shoulder 
the load offensively in order 
for the Wolverines to replicate 
last season’s success.
After 
an 
impressive 

freshman 
season 
in 
which 
he notched 16 points in 29 
games, junior Adam Winborg 
has struggled to stay on the 
ice consistently. If he finds 
his way back on the ice with 
consistency, he may be a factor 
in the offensive zone once 
again.
Sophomore 
Josh 
Norris 
made an impact on the ice last 
season as a freshman recording 
eight goals and 15 assists. He 
has found the net once in each 
of the two exhibition matches 
and has been featured on the 
top line alongside Lockwood 
and 
sophomore 
Michael 
Pastujov.
Senior 
Brendan 
Warren 
brings stability and experience 
as the lone senior forward 

and one of two seniors on the 
roster. In 115 career games, he 
has recorded 17 points and 25 
assists.
Freshmen 
Garrett 
Van 
Wyhe, Jimmy Lambert, Nolan 
Moyle and Jack Randl all made 
their regular season debuts 
against Vermont while Jack 
Olmstead has only played in 
exhibition matches. Van Wyhe 
and Lambert were players to 
watch out for coming into the 
season according to Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson. Van Wyhe 
combines speed and strength 
in the center position with his 
6-foot-2, 
200-pound 
frame. 
Pearson says Lambert is a 
quick skater who “people will 
recognize and notice on the ice 
because of his skill level.”
