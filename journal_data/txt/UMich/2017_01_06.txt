University 
of 
Michigan 

researchers have released an 

app that helps Flint residents 

assess 
lead 
contamination 

levels by utilizing functions 

related to water testing and 

providing 
infrastructure-

related information. The team 

also worked with Flint Mayor 

Karen Weaver on data analytics 

for lead pipe removal.

The app, released in early 

December, 
gives 
residents 

information about distribution 

centers for water and water 

filters, locations where lead has 

been found in drinking water, 

areas where infrastructure is 

being replaced within Flint, 

the likelihood that water in a 

home or particular location is 

contaminated and instructions 

for water testing.

Jacob Abernethy, professor 

of electrical engineering and 

computer science, was one of the 

faculty members approached 

by Google to create an app that 

would assist those affected by 

the Flint water crisis, which 

led to the creation of MyWater-

Flint app.

“What came about was an 

idea for an app that would be 

useful for (Flint’s) citizens to 

Last 
month, 
a 
100-page 

report detailing measures that 

needed to be taken to ensure 

the safety of public drinking 

water in Flint was delivered 

to President Barack Obama. 

The report, written by the 

President’s Council of Advisors 

on Science and Technology, 

included the collaboration of 

Rosina Bierbaum, a University 

of 
Michigan 
professor 
of 

Natural 
Resources 
and 

Environment.

President Obama mandated 

the creation of the report in the 

wake of the Flint water crisis 

and wavering public trust in safe 

drinking water. The aim was to 

help eradicate all remaining 

water quality issues and it 

called for short- and long-term 

measures to be taken in order to 

guarantee safe drinking water 

for all Americans.

As a member of PCAST, 

Bierbaum 
co-chaired 
the 

group of PCAST members and 

experts addressing drinking 

water safety. This working 

group spearheaded the report, 

which concluded that, although 

largely safe, American drinking 

water quality could be further 

improved by a few measures, 

such 
as 
more 
succinct 

communication across agencies 

and real-time water quality 

monitoring.

At the last PCAST meeting in 

Washington, D.C. on November 

18, 
Bierbaum 
presentedthe 

goals of the report.

“Our 
real 
focus 
is 
on 

advancing 
science 
and 

technology,” she said. “Not to 

micromanage how it gets done.”

In addition to presenting 

the 
research 
findings 

Bierbaum included her policy 

recommendations.

“The 
federal 
government 

must lead but must clearly 

involve 
state, 
cities 
and 

drinking 
water 
experts 
to 

improve 
methodologies 

that can do comparative risk 

assessments of contaminant 

mixtures 
and 
across 
the 

complete water system,” she 

said last November.

Bierbaum added that the 

recommendations 
should 

supplement 
the 
ongoing 

measures 
under 
the 
Safe 

Over 
1,000 
law 
school 

professors 
from 
institutions 

in 49 states — including seven 

professors and five assistant 

professors at the University 

of Michigan Law School — 

signed a letter in opposition 

to 
President-elect 
Donald 

Trump’s nomination of Sen. 

Jeff 
Sessions 
(R–Ala.) 
as 

U.S. Attorney General. The 

letter, addressed to the U.S. 

Senate Judiciary Committee, 

presented 
arguments 
about 

why the Committee should 

reject the nomination at the 

confirmation 
hearings 
next 

week on Jan. 10 and 11.

The letter listed areas of 

concern in regards to Sessions’ 

politics, which include support 

for a wall along the country’s 

southern 
border, 
regressive 

drug and incarceration policies 

and 
a 
questioning 
of 
the 

relationship 
between 
fossil 

fuels and climate change.

approved a insurance design 

developed 
by 
University 
of 

Michigan 
researchers 
as 
a 

provision of the 2017 National 

Defense Authorization Act on 

Dec. 23. The defense bill, which 

authorized a $619 billion defense 

budget, also approved the testing

plan that reduces the financial 

barriers to essential, high-value 

clinical services — for a pilot 

in TRICARE, a health care 

program for active and retired 

military members and their 

dependents.

Originally created by faculty 

at the UM Center for V-BID 

in 2005, V-BID prioritizes the 

medications and services that 

are of highest priority to the 

consumer. V-BID represents an 

effort to shift the health care 

system from a fee-for-service 

system with high co-pays and 

deductibles to one with clinical 

nuance 
that 
considers 
the 

needs and health conditions of 

individuals.

In the wake of President-elect 

Donald Trump’s election, Ann 

Arbor entrepreneurs Kate Lind 

and Nate Stevens started a new 

project, Pincause, that designs 

and sells pins intended to raise 

awareness of social justice issues.

Pincause recently released its 

first pin — a multicolored hand 

design — in support of women’s 

rights and the women’s rights 

marches that will take place 

across the United States on and 

before January 21, the days 

surrounding Donald Trump’s 

inauguration.

“At first we had it as a closed 

fist that was many different 

bright colors, and then we 

decided to open it up and make it 

into the American Sign Language 

for love, which I think is perfect 

because our message is about love 

and inclusion,” said Penelope 

Dullaghan, the artist behind the 

multicolored hand design.

ON THE DAILY: FORMER NFL PLAYER RETURNS TO ‘U’ FOR DEGREE

SHOPPING ON A BUDGET.

News
2 — Friday, January 6, 2017
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Braylon Edwards, a former NFL wide receiver and University of 

Michigan student, announced via Twitter he would be returning to the 

University to finish his degree. In his tweet, he joked that he picked up a 

rigorous schedule for this semester.

Edwards, who attended the University from 2001 to 2004, pursued a 

bachelor’s degree in general studies prior to his departure for the NFL in 

the 2005 draft. 

During his time at the University, Edwards played under Coach Lloyd 

Carr and set both Michigan career and Big Ten records for most games 

with 100 or more receiving yards. He was recognized as the Big Ten 

Conference’s Most Valuable Player and awarded the Chicago Tribune 

Silver Football in 2004.

Edwards was also a member of the University’s track and field team. 

He ran in the 60, 100 and 200 yard dashes, in addition to participating in 

the high jump. 

Following his career as a Michigan football player, Edwards was 

drafted by the Cleveland Browns as a first-round pick in 2005. He then 

moved between several different teams but spent the majority of his 

career with the Browns.

LSA sophomore and avid football fan Daniel DeLuca said he 

appreciates how Edwards has chosen to return to complete his education, 

unlike many other football players who enter the professional leagues.

“I have no problem with someone coming back to finish their degree,” 

DeLuca said. “I think it’s cool for him to come back. I know a lot of players 

try to finish but have to leave early for the draft, which makes financial 

sense. I think it’s good for him.”

Public response has been mostly positive, with many fans praising his 

decision to return to the University and obtain his degree.

Drinking Water Act. She said she encourages 

collaboration in order to aid the collection and 

coordination of data, specifically pointing to water 

systems not currently under regulatory oversight. 

When she presented in November Bierbaum 

stated that America’s water system is generally 

in good shape but still is not totally sound. She 

detailed measures that can be taken to totally 

ensure good water quality, like the engagement of 

the citizen science coordinator and more detailed 

water quality analysis.

“Every agency has a citizen science coordinator, 

and we think engaging citizen science is really 

important for two reasons,” Bierbaum said. “One 

to educate the public about their water systems 

and indeed most water systems in the country are 

safe, and second to collect information from taps 

and well water we might not otherwise procure.”

Mary Heinen, a Flint native and University 

alum and staffer, spoke in support of Bierbaum’s 

work.

“I applaud folks that are working on this report 

and that are working to try and correct some of the 

horrible human rights abuses that have happened 

in Flint and I respect anybody that is thinking 

forward and trying to figure out what to do from 

here on out,” Heinen said.

Heinen also said that Flint’s ties to the 

University may be at play in getting the attention 

it needs.

“I think the communities of Flint and Dearborn 

and Ann Arbor — Southeast Michigan — that have 

the University of Michigan in their neighborhoods 

are definitely at an advantage,” Heinen said. 

“Because those are folks from the neighborhood 

that really care about what happens and I think 

it’s imperative that local communities and 

local schools and colleges and universities and 

churches and community groups and activists join 

together with a long-range plan and really look at 

this and try to figure out what to do and how they 

can help.”

She also said — while this report helps the 

situation in Flint — the water crisis was still poorly 

handled and crises of this magnitude always have 

a tedious recovery process.

“I’m skeptical about anybody that thinks what 

has happened can be cleaned up easily,” Heinen 

said. “I think it’s a human rights disaster … I think 

the similarities between Hurricane Katrina and 

Flint are glaring to me.”

While Bierbaum’s work on the PCAST report 

is an encouraging step in the ongoing Flint water 

crisis, political gridlock still plagues progress in 

resolving the Flint water crisis.

Gov. Rick Snyder delayed the passage of a 

bill that aligns with the PCAST report in taking 

specific measures to ensure 

adequate water quality. By 

failing to sign it, Michigan 

Rep. 
Dan 
Kildee 
(D–5) 

released 
a 
statement 
on 

Thursday echoing Heinen’s 

concerns.

“The Governor should sign 

this bill immediately,” Kildee 

wrote in a press release on 

Thursday. “Michiganders are 

sick and tired of waiting for 

the governor to step up to the 

plate and help fix this man-

made crisis he created in the 

first place.”

The statement also shared 

Bierbaum’s 
intentions 
of 

guaranteeing the best water 

quality possible.

“Right now, a common 

sense bill that would help 

prevent another water crisis 

is with the Governor awaiting 

his action,” Kildee wrote. 

“The Legislature passed the 

bill unanimously — and all 

the Governor needs to do 

is sign it into law.”

access a central hub of information about the water 

crisis.” Abernethy said. “(Google) had people who did 

software development, but they didn’t have people 

who did sort of data science, machine learning 

analytics stuff. With the help of a grad student a year 

and a half ago, I helped initiate this thing through 

Michigan called the Michigan Data Science Team.”

Abernethy worked with a group of students who 

organized and analyzed the data on Flint’s water 

crisis. They also worked with other professors and 

had support from Google throughout the process.

“We’ve made a collaboration with professors at 

UM-Flint, and we basically focus on all these data 

and analytics stuff and they focus on the software 

development side of things,” he said. “We’ve had 

weekly meetings with folks at Google who’ve helped 

with (user interface) and other issues and give advice 

on development.”

Cyrus Anderson, Michigan Data Science Team 

member and University alum, said they worked on 

identifying where the highest lead levels were while 

developing the app and identifying lead risk levels.

“It wasn’t clear what was causing the lead 

problems in Flint, so what the team first did was 

presenting where the high levels (of lead) were likely 

to be,” Anderson said. “From there, we built models 

predicting these high levels in order to find the 

risk factors associated with different aspects of the 

housing. Part of our project has also been figuring 

out where exactly the lead pipes are likely to be and 

predicting whether or not a house will have lead 

pipes or not.”

Abernethy pointed out that lead poisoning is 

not an issue that affects just Flint; many states do 

not recognize universal blood testing regulations, 

resulting in states like Pennsylvania having 

childhood lead-poisoning rates nearly double Flint’s.

“They found that Flint’s water problems are not 

actually unique to Flint — there are a large number 

of census tracts in the U.S. that have blood lead 

levels above the monitoring level,” Abernethy said. 

“Flint may only be the tip of the iceberg. The belief 

is that the idea of this information can be applied to 

different municipalities around the country — we 

definitely think this is very possible.”

The lack of information about the location of lead 

service lines and discord surrounding the need for 

partial or full pipelines has hindered the FAST Start 

program, Mayor Weaver’s pipe removal initiative. 

Abernethy and his team worked on this initiative 

as well, using their data science experience to help 

overcome these issues.

“The government of Michigan put forward 

approximately $25 million to do lead pipe removal in 

Flint, and one of the big recovery efforts was to get 

rid of all these service lines,” he said. “It’s quite an 

expensive process, trying to determine where lead is, 

and certain parts of the city had a lot more lead than 

other parts of the city.”

Abernethy’s team used the data provided by FAST 

Start in order to provide useful information to those 

in the program. The group analyzed a variety of 

factors and have provided access to the data through 

the app.

“And, of course, there are a lot of working variables 

here, like whether or not the property was occupied 

or the likelihood of the homeowner replacing the 

service lines on their own and not informing the 

government,” he said. “Some of the data that’s been 

collected from this FAST Start program, we are 

actually making available in the app.”

This implementation can be viewed on the 

MyWater-Flint homepage. Users can view what 

infrastructure is being replaced and what is 

currently being worked on. This can help Flint 

residents identify which areas have high lead risk 

levels.

LSA sophomore Aliah Richter said she believed 

it was important to utilize the prevalence of social 

media and developing technology in situations like 

the Flint water crisis.

“I think the entire concept is really innovative,” 

Richter said. “We’re so connected by technology 

today that pretty much the one thing that could 

connect all of us is phones and computers. So having 

an app like that and being able to interact with other 

people in your area that are also being affected by the 

situation — I think it’s really important for residents 

to be able to identify areas that are more likely to 

have high levels of lead, so I really like the idea of this 

app.”

Michigan alum, said the design originally started as a 

quest for a identifiable and unique symbol, much like 

other marches and protests have been affiliated with.

“It all started with the idea that the design has 

to be something really good and that it’s not just 

enough to have a message,” Stevens said. “The 

goal for this was to create a symbol. The hippie 

movement had a peace sign, and we wanted to 

create something similar for the women’s march 

and women’s movement.”

Stevens explained that he and Lind hope to 

draw nationwide attention to the project and raise 

money for women’s and civil rights groups.

“The goal for this is to gain national media 

coverage and to make a symbol that reaches tens of 

thousands of people marching and to raise $100,000 

for each the ACLU and Planned Parenthood,” said 

Stevens.

Lind discussed her dreams for the future of 

Pincause, expressing a desire to expand to other 

social justice issues.

“We hope that Pincause, in the future, will have 

other causes, so maybe in the second quarter of the 

year, we were thinking of making pins that support 

Flint and Syrian refugees,” Lind said.

According to MLive, the pins have already 

been shipped to 43 states and internationally to 

countries such as England and Australia.

“Some of us have concerns about 

his misguided prosecution of three 

civil rights activists for voter fraud in 

Alabama in 1985, and his consistent 

promotion of the myth of voter-

impersonation fraud,” the letter reads. 

“Some of us have concerns about his 

repeated 
opposition 
to 
legislative 

efforts to promote the rights of 

women and members of the LGBTQ 

community.”

The University professors which 

signed the letter, including Law 

Professor 
Margo 
Schlanger, 
who 

researches civil rights, prison reform, 

torts and surveillance and heads the 

University’s Civil Rights Litigation 

Clearinghouse. 
Schlanger 
opposes 

Sessions’ 
nomination 
because 
of 

what she described as an unfavorable 

history on civil rights legislation and 

allegations of racism towards former 

staffers in the past.

“Senator Sessions has a long history 

not just of racial insensitivity but of 

hostility to the vigorous enforcement 

of the nation’s civil rights laws,” 

Schlanger said. “That makes him 

an unacceptable choice to head the 

Department of Justice, which is the 

federal government’s lead civil rights 

enforcement agency.”

LSA junior Collin Kelly, chair of 

the University’s chapter of College 

Democrats, said he agrees with the 

letter and believes that the nomination 

is questionable, especially because of 

how Sessions’ attitude toward civil 

rights deviates from the platform put 

forth by Loretta Lynch, the current 

United States Attorney General.

“Someone being appointed who has 

been accused of being racist is offensive 

to the American people,” Kelly said. 

“There are laws all over the country, 

like voter ID laws, that specifically 

target minority communities and poor 

communities, and the Department 

of Justice is expected to investigate 

that these laws aren’t having negative 

effects 
on 
already 
marginalized 

communities. A lot of people are 

worried that if Sessions is Attorney 

General, that’s just not going to 

happen. If anything, civil rights 

protections will pretty much cease 

to exist.”

did 
not 

respond to requests for comment.

According 
to 
the 
American 

Civil Liberties Union, Sessions 

is against workplace protections 

for LGBTQ people, Black Lives 

Matter movement and voted for 

a constitutional ban on same-sex 

marriage and denounces the Voting 

Right Act. This history, along 

with Sessions’ racist remarks that 

caused his failure to be nominated 

as a federal judge in 1986, are a 

few reasons why David Uhlmann, 

director 
of 
the 
University’s 

Environmental Law and Policy 

Program, also signed the letter 

addressed to the chairman and the 

ranking of the Senate Committee on 

the Judiciary.

“I served for 17 years at the 

Justice Department, during both 

Democratic 
and 
Republican 

administrations, and care deeply 

about the Department and its 

work upholding the rule of law 

and protecting civil rights and 

the environment,” said Uhlmann. 

“During his career, Senator Sessions 

has opposed most of the essential 

work of the Justice Department, 

from 
fighting 
discriminating 

based on race, gender and sexual 

orientation to curbing pollution 

and anti-competitive behavior in 

business.”

While Uhlmann believes this 

massive opposition on the part of 

law professors across the country is 

extraordinary, he understands that 

a Republican majority will likely 

lead to Sessions’ confirmation.

Kelly also applauded the penned 

statement and said it serves to 

continue 
an 
important 
dialogue, 

especially in a time when political 

correctness is losing priority among 

both citizens and government.

“It 
makes 
me 
proud 
of 
my 

institution,” Kelly said. “These are 

professors, not activists, trying to 

make a political statement. They’re 

experts in their field, and if they’re 

saying this, I think it shows how real 

the problem is.” 

Schlanger 
stated 
that 
Sessions, 

despite an overwhelming Republican 

majority in Congress currently, may 

be so controversial that he could have 

a difficult time during the upcoming 

hearing.

“The Senate rarely declines to 

confirm a current or former Senator to 

executive office, but Senator Sessions 

is combining a problematic record 

with a stunning lack of candor to his 

colleagues that may actually move a 

few Republicans to the right side of 

this contest,” she said.

Looking at the future of American 

politics and civil rights discourse, 

Uhlmann and Schlanger agree that 

Sessions could impair very vital civil 

rights in the United States and would 

fail to uphold justice if he held a 

position of such wide discretion.

Uhlmann 
sees 
dangerous 

similarities 
between 
Sessions’ 

platform and the extreme viewpoints 

vocalized and made prominent by the 

Trump campaign.

“The 
confirmation 
of 
Senator 

Sessions 
as 
Attorney 
General 

would 
undermine 
immigration 

reform, 
criminal 
justice 
reform, 

environmental protection and civil 

liberties,” Uhlmann said. “That is 

no accident. Senator Sessions will 

provide a prominent voice to the most 

extreme views in the United States and 

undermine the diversity, inclusion and 

commitment to equality under the law 

that makes our country great.”

HEALTH CARE
From Page 1

Center Director A. Mark Fendrick said 

V-BID aims to change the national 

conversation on health care, from how 

much money is spent to how well it is 

spent.

“The fact that you pay the same 

amount out of pocket for every drug 

— whether it be a life-saving drug or 

a drug that makes your toenail fungus 

go away — makes no sense to me,” 

Fendrick said.

In a study conducted by V-BID Health 

and the American Health Policy Health 

Institutewhich reviewed the spending 

of 35 health insurance companies, the 

results showed that $2 billion of the 

$10 billion in net funds were allocated 

for wasteful and unnecessary health 

care spending. The United States 

spends more per capita than any other 

developed nation in the Organization 

for 
Economic 
Co-operation 
and 

Development 
Countries, 
yet 
there 

are inefficiencies and disparities that 

V-BID aims to address.

Fendrick has been on the forefront 

of this effort, working to bring reform 

to the U.S. health care system. In 

February, Fendrick testified before 

the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed 

Services Subcommittee on Personnel, 

explaining the principles and benefits 

of implementing V-BID.

Fendrick said it is rare for legislation, 

especially health care legislation, to 

receive bipartisan support.

“I brought an idea to the Senate 

Armed 
Services 
Committee 
that 

ultimately, 
with 
no 
lobbying 
or 

arguing, became law, which hardly 

ever happens,” Fendrick said. “We feel 

incredibly fortunate that we are one of 

the very few health care reform ideas 

with bipartisan political support.”

The pilot of V-BID will involve 

military individuals and families who 

are enrolled in the TRICARE program. 

The 
NDAA 
states 
the 
TRICARE 

program will provide high-quality 

medications and providers to covered 

beneficiaries while reducing the price 

of care.

Since the creation of the V-BID 

Center, a number of initiatives that are 

not limited to health care reform for 

military members and their families 

have been developed. The center also 

works to increase V-BID outreach to 

state Medicaid or Medicare plans, state 

employee health plans and specialty 

pharmaceuticals.

The future of V-BID is unknown, as 

the success of value-based insurance 

will be seen in the results of V-BID in 

the TRICARE and Medicare Advantage 

plans. V-BID has received bipartisan 

support in the United States Senate and 

House of Representatives, as insurance 

companies shift from delivering and 

financing fee-for-service care to value-

based care.

Already, 
value-based 
insurance 

design has been tested in a number of 

health care plans and is included in 

section 2713 of the Affordable Care Act. 

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 

Services report there are 11 Medicare 

Advantage plans participating in the 

Medicare Advantage V-BID Model.

Individuals who are enrolled in 

Medicare 
Advantage 
plans 
with 

specific 
chronic 
diseases 
receive 

reduced cost-sharing and may be able 

to receive additional supplemental 

services.

Fendrick said both the TRICARE 

pilot and Medicare pilot will provide 

information about the potential of 

value-based insurance design.

“The goods news about both the 

TRICARE pilot and Medicare pilot is 

that if both evaluations are shown to 

improve quality of care, improve the 

patient experience and temper health 

care cost growth,” Fendrick said. “The 

V-BID principles can be expanded to all 

50 states for Medicare and throughout 

the TRICARE program without any 

further regulatory intervention”.

LSA senior Madeleine Peters works 

at the University’s Center for V-BID 

and hopes to pursue a career in health 

care policy. Peters said her time at 

the center has been invaluable to 

her and provided her with a greater 

understanding of the U.S. health care 

system.

“My time at the V-BID Center has 

opened my eyes to the world of health 

care policy and how there is so much 

that can be changed,” Peters said.

Peters 
traveled 
to 
Washington, 

D.C. to sit in on briefings at the U.S. 

House of Representatives and Senate 

that discussed the importance of 

value-based insurance and proposed 

legislation. 
Peters 
said 
that 
her 

experience with V-BID has fostered 

her interest and passion in working to 

reform health care.

“During my time working at V-BID, 

I 
have 
expanded 
my 
knowledge 

of the health care system and the 

opportunities for improvement,” Peters 

said. “Working at the V-BID Center 

has also taught me the importance 

of educating others, advocating for a 

change, upholding connections and 

meeting deadlines.”

The participants of TRICARE make 

up just one population V-BID can reach 

as the center strives to increase access 

to millions of Americans. Almost 10 

million active and retired military 

personnel and their dependents on 

TRICARE will now be able to opt for 

value-based insurance.

Fendrick said it is the Center for 

V-BID’s mission to give people the 

option to enroll in a health plan with 

V-BID principles and that expansion to 

TRICARE is a major achievement for 

the center.

“I am honored to have any role in 

making the health care for the folks 

who serve our country better and more 

efficient from a financial standpoint,” 

Fendrick said.

The fact that you pay 
the same amount out 
of pocket for every 
drug — whether it 
be a life-saving drug 
or a drug that makes 
your toenail fungus go 

away — makes no

I

t has been posited that were 
it not for the Democratic 
National 
Committee’s 

tactics and deep-rooted support 
for 
Hillary 
Clinton, 
Bernie 

Sanders would have been the 
blue candidate and would have 
been victorious over President-
elect Donald Trump. Though 
he, like Trump, would have been 
a viable “change candidate” in 
his party and shared similarly 
nationalistic views, it can be 
shown that a Sanders presidential 
campaign would have failed to 
gain the necessary support to 
defeat Trump. Sanders ultimately 
would have faltered, because 
of the both characteristics that 
distinguished him from Clinton 
and their shared similarities. 

Sanders was unlike Clinton 

in 
terms 
of 
his 
pervasive 

economic view. Sanders is a 
Democratic socialist and would 
have been far too liberal to win a 
national election. He believes in 
universal healthcare, free public 
college tuition and a massive 
redistribution of wealth. Aside 
from 
college-educated 
voters 

— whose votes didn’t swing the 
election in Clinton’s favor — my 
sense from the election results is 
that a sizable number of voters, 
independent of party, rejected a 
Democratic socialist paradigm 
for the country. 

While 
many 
millennials 

supported Sanders, it must be 
known that their turnout is 
historically low. As National 
Public Radio wrote about the 
2012 
election, 
“millennials 

continue to have the lowest 
voter turnout of any age group. 
Only about 46 percent voted in 
the last presidential election; 
compared to 72 percent of the 
Silent Generation, who habitually 
punch above their weight.” Thus, 
despite their support, there was 
no guarantee that they would 
have made it to the polls. 

Moreover, voters in the primary 

elections are far more radical 
than those in the general election. 
Thus, there is no guarantee that 
Sanders’s radical platform would 
have been compatible with the 
electorate in the bigger picture. 
Since the primary vote would 
be 
unreliable 
in 
calculating 

Sanders’s chances of winning 
the general election, we must 
turn to polls as the last resource. 
However, it must be known that 
polling can be a flawed tool — as 
evidenced by this election. While 
the Gravis Marketing poll shows 
that Sanders would have won 
56 percent of the vote against 
Trump, it cannot be taken as 
truth. The so-called “shy Trump” 
voter effect might still manifest 
itself in this poll, thus proving 

it to be inaccurate. While a “shy 
Bernie” effect might be in play, 
it would prove to be in far fewer 
numbers because of Trump’s even 
more radical and taboo nature.

Sanders was similar to Clinton 

in that he would have been the 
Democratic 
Party’s 
candidate 

— a fact that would similarly 
work to his demise. Though an 
Independent candidate himself, 
he would have relied on the DNC 
for support during a presidential 
campaign 
and 
would 
have 

advanced a Democratic platform 
and narrative. Comparisons show 
that Clinton and Sanders shared 
more views regarding policy than 
Trump, but Sanders was even 
more liberal than Clinton. Since 
the country elected Trump, it 
follows then that Sanders’s leftist 
views would not have made him 
more competitive than Clinton. 

An 
electoral 
victory 
for 

Sanders might have required 
victories 
in 
Pennsylvania, 

Michigan, Florida and Wisconsin, 
which Clinton was unable to 
achieve. As the Cook report 
revealed, Clinton would have 
prevailed in the Electoral College 
vote had she won 109,000 more 
votes in Michigan, Wisconsin 
and Pennsylvania, and therefore 
she would have been elected 
president. 
More 
importantly, 

if she’d swung Florida and 
Michigan by about 128,000 votes, 
Clinton might have emerged 
victorious save for a relatively 
small number of ballots. Out of a 
pool of 128 million votes, 128,000 
is one-tenth of one percent — a 
rounding error.

It is a tremendous leap to 

suggest that this slim margin 
would 
have 
been 
further 

narrowed if Sanders had run. As 
evidenced by a chart provided 
by Mother Jones, Sanders is 
the most “liberal” candidate to 
ever run for the office. Much 
like Clinton, he too would have 
failed to get the demographics of 
moderate Republicans or women. 

Additionally, 
Sanders 

might 
have 
made 
similar 

miscalculations regarding the 
morals of Trump supporters 
and Trump’s appeal outside 
metropolitan areas, as Clinton 
did. In essence, his comments 
that Trump and some of his 
supporters 
are 
misogynistic, 

racist, etc. would not have fared 
well. In an interview with The 
Washington Post, Kathy Cramer 
examined the mindset of many 
Wisconsinites. 
She 
stated, 

“people felt that they weren’t 
getting respect. They would say: 
The real kicker is that people 
in the city don’t understand 
us. 
They 
don’t 
understand 

what rural life is like, what’s 
important to us and what 
challenges that we’re facing. 
They think we’re a bunch of 
redneck racists.” 

While Trump and Sanders 

ran similar campaigns in Rust 
Belt states, it can be speculated 
that this rural demographic 
would not have liked being 
labeled as racists by Sanders. 
This is ultimately echoed in his 
tweets stating, “I do not believe 
that most of the people who 
are thinking about voting for 
Mr. Trump are racist or sexist 
… But some are.” While this 
fundamentally 
comments 
on 

a minority of people, it is still 
a generalization nonetheless. 
After all, Clinton’s comment 
that “you could put half of 
Trump’s supporters into what 
I call the basket of deplorables” 
did not fare particularly well 
for her. 

It also may be speculated that 

Sanders’s religion could have 
proved to be a liability in the 
general election. Sandy Maisel, 
a professor at Colby College who 
tracks the status of Jews in the 
United States, has stated that 
“in some ways, it’s a non-story.” 
According to the Pew Research 
Center, studies show that 8 in 10 
people say their votes wouldn’t 
be affected upon finding out a 
candidate is Jewish. However, 
while Sanders identifies as a 
secular 
Jew 
without 
strong 

organizational ties, this year 
saw a particularly heightened 
political 
climate 
marked 
by 

ethnocentrism. 
As 
mentioned 

above, Trump, along with a 
great deal of his support base, 
was 
labeled 
as 
xenophobic, 

racist and anti-Semitic, among 
other things. Instances of these 
biases manifested themselves on 
numerous occasions at rallies. For 
example, at an Oct. 29 campaign 
event in Phoenix, a Trump 
supporter 
was 
condemned 

after 
chanting 
“Jew-S-A!” 

Similarly, according to recent 
FBI numbers, more than 57 
percent of the 1,140 documented 
anti-religious hate crimes in 
2014 were spurred on by anti-
Semitism. Though some might 
state that anti-Jewish bias is 
not a value the majority of the 
electorate holds, it might also 
be said that it would have been 
brought to life because of some of 
Trump’s supporters. 

Thus, 
while 
it 
is 
merely 

speculative, 
evidence 
seems 

to suggest that Bernie Sanders 
would not have beaten Donald 
Trump had he been on the 
Democratic ticket this November. 
In short, while the electorate 
was 
looking 
for 
change, 

Bernie’s 
platform 
would 

have 
been 
too 
liberal. 
In 

contemporary terms, Sanders 
would have felt the “burn” if he 
had run against Trump. 

T

here’s 
often 
a 
sense 

among educated, liberal 
elites that there just aren’t 

enough of us. If only everyone went 
to college, then we could really get 
at solving the world’s 
problems. 
If 
only 

those 
people 
read 

“The New Jim Crow,” 
then 
they 
would 

understand 
racial 

segregation and be 
on our side. This elite 
mindset imagines a 
world where societal 
dysfunctions 
like 

bigotry and apathy 
can be cured by some 
good books and four years of 
instruction. 

This is true to a certain extent. 

Many studies have found that 
going to college diminishes racial 
prejudice. While no one thinks 
that college is a cure-all, popular 
imagination 
contends 
that 

education and a populace having 
more knowledge get everyone on 
the same page.

Think about something as 

“mundane” as people’s attitudes 
toward global warming. Belief 
in 
global 
warming 
should 

theoretically 
be 
universally 

improved 
upon 
by 
a 
good 

science education. The typical 
understanding of that dynamic is 
that global warming is happening 
and those who don’t believe in it 
just don’t know enough (or are 
corporate shills). Unfortunately, 
this isn’t the case.

In a recent study, Yale professor 

Dan Kahan recorded respondents’ 
political beliefs, measured their 
“science intelligence” (a metric 
recording 
of 
their 
scientific 

knowledge 
and 
quantitative 

reasoning abilities) and whether or 
not they believed that “there is solid 
evidence of recent global warming 
due mostly to human activity such 
as burning fossil fuels.” He found 
that the more political knowledge 
someone had, the more likely they 

were to align with the party line 
regarding global warming. That 
is, conservatives with a strong 
understanding of science are more 
likely to believe global warming 

isn’t happening, while 
scientifically 
literate 

liberals believe global 
warming 
at 
much 

higher 
rates 
than 

their 
less-educated 

counterparts. 

Almost a year ago, I 

wrote about a similar 
phenomenon 
that 

caused 
partisans 
to 

seek out information 
that confirmed their 

existing opinions. But this goes 
beyond that. People with strong 
identities 
will 
actively 
reject 

information that doesn’t confirm 
their biases. Additionally, people 
with strong partisan identities form 
partisan opinions more quickly 
and more often when presented 
with 
unfamiliar 
scientific 

information. For instance, giving a 
set of Republicans and Democrats 
with little agricultural knowledge 
facts about the health risks of 
genetically modified organisms 
and telling them that Democrats 
are more likely to believe that 
GMOs are harmful will cause both 
groups to join the party line. 

This is particularly troubling 

given the increasingly polarized 
state of American politics. A lot has 
been made of Americans living in 
a “post-fact” reality where facts no 
longer carry persuasive currency. 
This can be true, but it seems as 
though even having those facts 
doesn’t bring our society closer 
together. While Kahan’s study 
focused on climate change, we 
can expect this dynamic exist 
in all sorts of domains. Welfare 
reform, social justice and news 
coverage are all subject to this bias. 
Suddenly, it seems as though more 
education and more facts won’t 
help bridge the gaps in our society.

But there is hope. In another 

study, Kahan found that people 
with high levels of intellectual 
curiosity are willing to buck 
their 
party’s 
consensus 
and 

accept science’s consensus. So, 
it is possible to fix this rampant 
bias toward contorting facts; our 
society needs to reinvigorate a 
desire to learn and a belief that 
learning starts, not stops, at the 
classroom’s door. We can look 
within our community for ways to 
do this. The University of Michigan 
wants to inspire leadership, but 
there needs to be more. Teaching 
students to be lifelong learners 
is imperative. I think there are a 
lot of ways to inspire this sort of 
intellectual curiosity. 

As a University, we can move 

away from tests and research 
papers as the primary ways of 
measuring a student’s mastery. I 
appreciate that with large weeder 
courses like Econ 101, there are few 
opportunities to assess students’ 
understanding outside tests, but 
there are many seminar-style 
courses where the final project 
could draw directly from other 
disciplines. Shakespeare classes 
could combine literary analysis 
with interviews with scholars; 
math courses could challenge 
students to find ways to take the 
techniques they’ve learned in 
class and apply them in their own 
lives. Let students do independent 
projects to round out courses 
rather than following a narrow set 
of guidelines.

This paradigmatic change is a 

large undertaking, but the rewards 
are well worth it. Universities have 
an obligation to our civic society 
and creating students whose love 
of learning continues long after 
graduation only serves to better 
the lives of everyone around them. 
Let’s try to be a model for the rest 
of society by being the learners and 
the best.

More unity, less division

IBRAHIM IJAZ | COLUMN

I

n Mark Zuckerberg’s annual 
“year in review” video, one 
quote stood out to me: “Even 

when we seemed at our most 
divided, we were still connected.” 
There’s a dynamic presented 
here between connectivity and 
divisiveness. 
As 
our 
society 

is 
quickly 
adopting 
ultra-

connectivity, are we losing our 
ability to be unified? As we continue 
down this path of increasing 
technological proximity, we have 
a responsibility to work toward 
more unity. The advent of the new 
year is a lot like going to the barber 
for a long overdue haircut. We 
need to reflect on what made 2016 
a year of widespread disunity in 
order to get a fresh 2017 cut.

Perhaps 
our 
issues 
with 

unity lie in our obsession with 
labels. Last month, Tomi Lahren 
embodied my issues with labeling 
during an interview with Trevor 
Noah. Noah asked Lahren if she 
was a conservative, to which she 
responded: “I do … I mean I’m a 
millennial so I really don’t like 
labels.” The sheer irony involved 
in Lahren dropping one label for 
another aside, the picking of one’s 
own labels hints at a greater issue: 
group attribution. For example, 
I’m a Muslim, but that doesn’t 
mean that all of my opinions are 
the opinions of Islam or that my 
actions represent the whole faith. 
While I would like to think my 
actions reflect Islam, they don’t. 
They simply reflect the perception 
I have of Islam.

However, the very nature of 

labels convinces us that the label 
holder is a representative, an 
ambassador of sorts. Why does 
this matter? Critiques lodged at 
groups, whether racial, religious 
or political, often stem from the 
actions of a few of the group’s 
members. As recent graduate 
Areeba Jibril was quoted in a flyer 

for the University of Michigan’s 
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 
program, “Diversity is speaking for 
myself without being seen as the 
spokesperson for all individuals 
who share my identities.” 

It’s 
not 
that 
labels 
aren’t 

necessary in society. In many 
cases, they benefit individuals, 
especially those who are a part 
of 
marginalized 
groups, 
like 

with increased efforts to admit 
non-white students into higher 
education programs. But most of 
the time, labeling’s negative side 
effects, like group attribution 
and blame redirection, are just 
plainly counterproductive. Take 
ISIS as a prime example. Instead 
of focusing on the political roots 
of the terrorist group or on the 
poverty many of its supporters 
face in Iraq and Syria, many falsely 
believe the group represents Islam. 
Even by continuing to be labeled as 
the “Islamic State,” their status as 
representatives of the religion is 
further validated. 

The same goes for the debate 

about calling radical extremism 
Islamic extremism. As President 
Barack Obama said, “We must 
never accept the premise that 
they put forward because it is a 
lie. Nor should we grant these 
terrorists the religious legitimacy 
that they seek.” As a result, we 
have not yet learned about their 
origins in a way that will affect 
future foreign policy. Labeling, in 
a sense, is a cop out. It allows us 
to say, “Well, they’re a part of that 
group, and that group has some 
intrinsic problems which we can’t 
do anything about.”

We saw this right after the 2016 

election as well. Many supporters 
of Hillary Clinton described the 
entire red portion of the electoral 
map as racist, sexist or bigoted. 
Labeling all Donald Trump voters 
as illogical and narrow-minded 
does nothing but ignore the 
real issues at hand. A common 
sentiment 
among 
those 
who 

voted for the president-elect was 
a feeling of exclusion from the 
political climate for the eight years 
since President Obama took office. 
The problems they see with the 
United States, like job-access and 
untrustworthiness of government, 
should concern all Americans, but 
when Democrats stop listening 
before Republicans open their 
mouths, then the country stands 
to suffer.

When 
we 
label, 
we’re 

automatically categorizing based on 
these surface level characteristics. 
But when we dig deeper, we see 
that people share a lot of the same 
fundamental morals, goals and 
struggles. If we stay on this path 
of letting labels be the end of the 
conversation, then we won’t be able 
to solve our problems. Labeling is 
counterproductive, keeping the two 
sides of the aisle far from each other 
and strengthening the disunified 
forces at large.

Martin Luther King Jr. dreamed 

of a nation devoid of this disuniting 
labeling, where we are judged by 
the content of our character rather 
than the color of our skin. And we, 
as a society, need to unify now more 
than ever. A recent Washington 
Post article explains this Congress 
is more polarized than it has been 
in over 100 years. When we’re 
polarized, we find fewer reasons 
to listen to each other and fail to 
progress as a result. 

So as we walk in with our messy 

haircuts to the barber shop this 
new year, let’s consider our options. 
We can vaguely hope for a good 
outcome and squirm in our chair 
as the barber botches the hairdo, 
or we can confidently set limits and 
guidelines for our hairstylist and 
leave looking fresh for 2017. Let’s 
come together in 2017 and limit 
our divisive labeling while opening 
our ears to further discourse and 
conversation.

TV REVIEW

It’s one of the few absolutes in film: 

there has never been a good video 
game movie. In the 23 years since 
“Super Mario Bros.” was released to 
resounding vitriol, not one film in 
the genre has crossed the line into 
even mediocre. But as “Assassin’s 
Creed” approached, 
it 
seemed 
like 
it 

would be the one 
to break the mold. 
Justin Kurzel, who 
helmed 
last 
year’s 

visually 
astounding 

adaptation 
of 

“Macbeth,” 
signed 

on 
to 
direct. 
He 

brought 
with 
him 

Michael 
Fassbender 
(“Inglourious 

Basterds”) 
and 
Marion 
Cotillard 

(“Inception”), two actors who not 
only add credibility to their chosen 
projects, but who have done great 
work in genre films in the past. All 
the pieces were in place for a great 
video game movie to finally happen, 
but somehow everything still went 
wrong.

“Assassin’s 
Creed” 
opens 
by 

introducing 
the 
audience 
to 
its 

sympathetic, likeable main character, 
Fassbender’s 
convicted 
murderer 

Callum Lynch. However, in the rush 
to get to more scenes of Cotillard and 
a sadly underused Jeremy Irons (“The 
Lion 
King”) 
vomiting 
exposition 

everywhere, the script forgets to 
give Lynch any humanity or depth 
whatsoever. The audience is stuck 
with an unappealing, uninteresting 
character.

After 
what 
feels 
like 
an 

interminable amount of time, Lynch is 

finally put into the Animus, 
a virtual reality machine, 
to live out the memories of 
his ancestors. This is what 
fans of the series have been 
waiting years to see. The 
idea of seeing it on screen 
is likely what brought the 
vast majority of viewers 
to the theater, and yet it 
is possibly the worst part 

of the whole ordeal. To be sure, the 
scenes in the present are boring and 
far too long, but at least they were 
competently made. The scenes in 
15th century Barcelona, a city which 
was apparently constantly cloaked in 
a CGI sandstorm, are so poorly put 
together that it’s mind-boggling.

Most of these scenes are made 

up of a series of action sequences in 
order to give the plot some illusion of 
momentum. To be fair, there is some 
fantastic stunt work on display here, 
but it’s ruined by some of the most 

atrocious editing of the year. As it 
turns out, “Assassin’s Creed” works 
best when looked at as a cautionary 
tale about the importance of editing. 
The constant cutting back and forth 
between something that might be 
considered 
exciting 
in 
the 
past 

and Callum miming his ancestor’s 
actions in the present results in 
some seriously laughable imagery. 
Even when the film stays in one time 
period for more than three seconds, it 
still cuts between shots and locations 
so often that there’s no tension, no 
intensity, no excitement. There’s just 
incomprehensible “action shot” after 
incomprehensible “action shot” and 
an Academy Award-nominated actor 
miming said action shots. It would be 
utterly hilarious if it wasn’t so damn 
infuriating.

Finally, after another hour of 

overwrought exposition scenes and 
mystifyingly subpar action scenes, 
“Assassin’s Creed” ends with a rushed 
climax and resolution that bait a 
sequel that, God willing, will never 
see the light of day. It’s awful, but by 
that point, it’s to be expected. This 
was supposed to be the film to finally 
change the tide of junky video game 
movies. Instead, it became a part of 
the epidemic itself, perhaps the final 
nail in the coffin for video game fans 
who dare to hope.

“Assassin’s Creed” an unmitigated mess

Video game adaptation fails to meet even the slightest standards of success

Jacqueline Kennedy’s pink Chanel 

suit and pillbox hat may be the most 
famous outfit in recent history. It’s 
almost like the Coke logo or Marilyn 
Monroe’s face — a quintessentially 
American image burned into collective 
memory. 
Like 

most 
symbols 
of 

classic 
Americana, 

it 
was 
gruesomely 

distorted. When her 
husband was shot, 
Jackie 
refused 
to 

clean the blood off 
her 
perfect 
pink 

suit, and reportedly 
regretted 
washing 

it off her face and 
hands. “I want them 
to see what they’ve done to Jack,” she 
said.

This is where “Jackie” begins. 

Directed by Pablo Larraín (“Neruda”) 
and starring Natalie Portman (“A 
Tale of Love and Darkness”), the film 
is an exploration of the First Lady’s 
reaction and response to her husband’s 
assassination. “Jackie” is the latest 
in the recent trend of biopics such as 
“The Social Network,” “Lincoln” or 
“The Wolf of Wall Street” that turn 
historical 
figures 
into 
traditional 

fictional characters instead of merely 
pointing to the significant moments of 
their lives.

There are two Jacqueline Kennedys 

in “Jackie.” There’s the poised and regal 
woman who painstakingly redecorated 

the White House and was a style icon 
to millions. And then there’s the Jackie 
behind the camera, who speaks in a 
register about an octave lower than 
the first: tough, determined and made 
of absolute steel. It’s the second Jackie 
the audience sees for a majority of the 
film. We follow her as she arranges 
the funeral and moves out of the 
White House, all while confronting 

the hungry press, the all-
too-eager Lyndon Johnson 
and the task of determining 
how her husband will be 
remembered.

The film is a deeply 

personal one. Tight close-
up shots and shaky camera 
work 
dominate 
as 
the 

audience is given entry into 
some of the most intimate 
moments 
of 
Jackie’s 

life. This allows Natalie 

Portman’s performance to shine as it 
takes center stage, but unfortunately 
relegates all the other characters 
and conflicts to the background. The 
movie is hyper-focused on Jackie, both 
figuratively in terms of its story, and 
literally. She is in every scene, and the 
camera follows her closely. The effect 
is unsettling, but maybe not in the way 
the filmmakers intended.

“Jackie” was clearly meant to be 

an intensely affecting film. We’re 
thrown into the psychology of this 
very interesting person in order to 
see the world the way she saw it 
during that awful week following the 
assassination. All of the elements are 
technically in place for the audience 
to be fully absorbed and ready to 

empathize with Jackie. The score 
by Mica Levi (“Under the Skin”) is 
hypnotic, Portman’s performance is 
subtle but powerful, and the camera 
work is intimate, to say the least. And 
yet, none of this comes together.

The story just isn’t quite functional, 

meaning that none of the rules of 
drama that would make it actually 
resonate are put into place. None 
of the choices the character makes 
are contingent on each other. Plot 
elements just sort of happen, with no 
build or release of tension. Instead of 
being a story built on cause and effect, 
it’s a story based off of the principle 
of “and now this is happening.” And 
that’s just no way to invest viewers in a 
narrative. It doesn’t matter how pretty 
the score or how perfect Portman’s 
accent. It also doesn’t matter that most 
of the plot points of the film happened 
in real life. We need actual character 
motivation 
and 
good 
dramatic 

storytelling to register emotionally 
what is happening.

“Jackie” looks great. Its period 

setting is visually perfect, the score is 
unnerving, it’s filmed in a seemingly 
artful way and the acting is high 
quality. But underneath the glossy 
surface, it’s a hollow shell of a story. 
The real Jacqueline Kennedy, both the 
public and private versions, deserved 
far better than this. She too had a 
pretty surface that looked nice on 
camera. Unlike her biopic, however, 
the real Kennedy had depth, intention 
and 
layers. 
For 
this, 
Jacqueline 

Kennedy’s legacy will endure. “Jackie” 
will be lucky if it makes it past the next 
Oscar season. 

TV REVIEW

“Sherlock” mostly works

After a hiatus that lasted long 

enough for some “Sherlock” 
fans to graduate high school 
and forget about the show, the 
modern mystery solver is back. 
The 
premiere 
of 

the long awaited 
Season 4, “The Six 
Thatchers,” began 
with 
the 
funny 

self-proclaimed 
“sociopath” tweet-
ing on his phone 
despite 
being 
in 

the middle of a 
Really 
Important 

Secret 
Meeting, 

lulling viewers into 
a relaxed amuse-
ment, tinged with anticipation. 
This didn’t last long: the plot 
twist of the final 20 minutes 
left me — and most of Tum-
blr fandom, where many of the 
show’s fans reside — alternating 
between a confused daze and 
suspicions that there might be 
genius somewhere in it. I happen 
to lean towards the former.

The arc of the mystery in “The 

Six 
Thatchers” 
falls 
slightly 

short, deriving more of its ener-
gy from the action than from a 
clever framework of the case and 
the clue-by-clue sleuthing, one of 
the main draws of the first two 
seasons of the show. Sherlock 
(Benedict Cumberbatch, “The 
Imitation Game”) first solves a 
mysterious death that Watson 
(Martin Freeman, “The Hob-
bit: The Desolation of Smaug”) 
later blogs about, of course, but 
one of the clues from that case 
provides the link to the next — 
which has something to do with 
Mary (Amanda Abbington, “Mr. 
Selfridge”), Watson’s wife. Once 
again, we are plunged into con-
fusion about whether to trust 
Mary, who runs away across the 
world, purportedly to protect her 
husband and daughter from her 
previous identity and the dangers 
that come with it.

Of course, Sherlock (and Wat-

son) find her — but so does Mary’s 
would-be assassin, a previous co-
worker in her line of secret agent 
work. While he is unsuccessful 
in his mission there, in the end 
of the episode there is a shock-
ing death; but it feels, somehow, 

ungenuine. Either 
a 
major 
charac-

ter has just been 
killed off in a very 
hasty way, or in the 
next two episodes 
there’s going to be 
some 
miraculous 

return from death 
— again. One would 
hope that the plot 
maneuver 
would 

only be employed 
once, though there 

are also allusions to another vil-
lain who was killed in Season 
3 maybe making a return. The 
hints read neither as red herrings 
nor feasible plot points, making 
for a disjointed episode.

Throughout “The Six Thatch-

ers,” there are moments of humor: 
Sherlock trying to explain things 
to a baby, Sherlock outsmart-
ing people and being rude about 
it without meaning to, Sherlock 
choosing Mary and a dog over 
Watson as a sleuthing partner 
for an expedition, and of course 
the bitter banter between Sher-
lock and his brother. But though 
those feel familiar and comfort-
ing, they’re not enough to carry 
the episode. The show itself is a 
complex modern mystery, with 
weaving and dodging parts; the 
pacing — and the protagonist — 
can make you feel foolish if you 
can’t keep up. But despite that, 
even if the confusing elements 
were 
confusing 
intentionally, 

the overall episode doesn’t quite 
live up to the hype that a three-
year hiatus inevitably creates.

Hopefully the next episode 

reconciles Sherlock and Watson, 
because while conflict makes for 
good TV, shots of Benedict Cum-
berbatch being sad and alone 
don’t.

Have you ever pressed ‘A’ on 

a TV in a Pokémon game to see 
what was playing?

“There’s a movie on TV,” the 

text box reads. “Four boys are 
walking down railroad tracks. 
…I’d better go, 
too.”

This 
is, 

of 
course, 
a 

reference 
to 

“Stand By Me,” 
the 
1986 
Rob 

Reiner 
film 

adapted 
from 

Stephen King’s 
“The Body.” The 
film 
and 
the 

book it’s based on are seminal 
texts that explore working 
class 
heteromasculinity; 

they’re favorites among those 
who grew up in the ‘80s — 
those who have a fondness 
for an era with less parental 
guidance and a larger, more 
mysterious earth to explore.

While it’s difficult to say 

whether the original Japanese 
text made such a reference 
or 
whether 
the 
English 

localization staff embellished 
the nod, it’s equally difficult 
not to wonder whether “Stand 
By 
Me” 
had 
a 
profound 

influence on Japanese Role-
Playing 
Games 
— 
youth 

abandoning their hometowns 
to go on a parent-less adventure 
is quite nearly a cliché in the 
genre. 
“Chrono 
Trigger,” 

“Kingdom 
Hearts,” 
“Secret 

of Mana,” “Earthbound” and 
most certainly “Pokémon” all 
introduce their narratives in 
this way. And even if they’re 
framed around a different 
concept (“Final Fantasy VII” 
following a group of radical 
ecoterrorists is an example) 
many more of these games are 
structured like road trips. A 
group of friends travel across 

great distances and make stops 
in fascinating little towns. It’s 
a formula for success.

So “Final Fantasy XV” is 

most certainly not the first 
road trip video game, but 
it’s the first video game to 
literalize the concept into 
gameplay. We open on a dusty, 
western highway, on which 

four 
gorgeous, 

primped 
anime 

boys are pushing 
a 
broken-down 

luxury 
car 

towards 
a 
gas 

station. As they 
banter 
among 

themselves 
and 

the player takes 
control of the car-
pushing effort, a 

Florence + The Machine cover 
of Ben E. King’s “Stand By Me” 
song swells in the background 
(it 
incorporates 
a 
bit 
of 

the classic “Final Fantasy” 
title screen music into its 
orchestration, a nice touch). 
Could it be clearer what 
we’re supposed to be thinking 
about? This genre. That movie. 
Angst. Coming-of-age. That 
childhood desire to pack up an 
old-timey knapsack and head 
out to the Yukon, “Calvin and 
Hobbes”-style.

The anime boys in question 

are Noctis, a prince, and 
his three confidants Ignis, 
Prompto, 
and 
Gladiolis. 

Those familiar with “Final 
Fantasy” shouldn’t balk at 
the Latinesque nonsense that 
comprises their names, but for 
everyone else, hearing names 
like this spoken very seriously 
out loud will take some getting 
used to.

But there’s not much else 

about “FFXV” ’s introductory 
sequence that “Final Fantasy” 
die-hards will expect. There’s 
no daring bombing mission. No 
epic swordfight. No futuristic 
water polo game. Rather than 
being shoved headlong into a 

desperate scenario, the game 
quietly picks up with four kids 
driving around, listening to an 
indie singer and talking about 
things. It’s jarring, to say the 
very least.

“Final Fantasy” has blended 

modern and future technology 

with classical high fantasy 
aesthetics in the past, but 
never like this. “FFXV” drops 
our Anime heroes into a 
world of Western Americana, 
complete with diners, gas 
stations and a whole lot of 
desert. It feels new.

And there’s more Western 

influence than merely the

visual. Like last year’s “Metal Gear Solid V,” 
“FFXV” represents a massive left turn for a 
franchise that’s been around for decades — 
abandoning the precedent of narrative linearity 
that was held very closely to in the last single-
player “Final Fantasy game in favor of a quest-
based open-world structure.

It’s a lot like “The Witcher 3.” The player 

can progress through a singular “main quest” 
storyline, complete standalone side quests for 
experience or take on lucrative bounty hunts 
involving 
tough 
fights 
against 
“daemons,” 

mindless wild beasts emboldened by mysterious 
antagonists. While I wish the side quests were 
more complex (most of them are simple MMO-
style fetch quests), they provide a meaningful 
alternative to traditional grinding since each 
of them provides experience points and reward 
items. 

Those comparisons aside, the game “FFXV” 

shares the most DNA with is “Kingdom Hearts.” 
Before a massive team transition in 2014 in 
which Hajime Tabata took over development as 
director, “FFXV” was to be the first main series 
“Final Fantasy” game to be directed by Tetsuya 
Nomura, the guy who directed the first two 
Kingdom Hearts games. His influence shows 
itself blatantly in the game’s combat. Fighting in 
“FFXV” is essentially an expansion of the action-
based combat in “Kingdom Hearts,” the primary 
differences being the ability to hold the attack 
button rather than mashing it, and an emphasis 
on maneuvering to the backs of enemies to do 
extra damage.

Magic and summoning are also overhauled. 

Magic 
involves 
charging 
spells 
by 
using 

resources picked up in the environment, and 
deploying them as massive area-of-effect attacks 
that one would use much like a grenade in a first-
person shooter. It never really clicked for me as 
useful, but I’ve seen other gamers on YouTube 
harness it quite effectively. Really, it’s a matter 
of preference.

Summoning is strange. Essentially, the player 

can call gods down from the heavens to do 
massive damage to everything in the area, 
but only when the gods feel like helping? The 
criteria for when a summon appears feels 
inconsistent. It’s not at all reliable, but its 
rarity makes it admittedly very cool whenever 
it happens.

But what really keeps the combat in “FFXV” 

entertaining over the course of its runtime 
(about a 15-hour campaign with about three 
times as much side content) is its extraordinary 
enemy variety. I constantly marveled at the 
creativity expressed in the often gigantic 
creatures Noctis and company were tasked 
with hunting them down. Some of the later-
game fights against screen-filling monsters 
are breathtaking — highlights of an all-
around excellent single player story that shifts 
drastically as it progresses.

“FFXV” 
goes 
from 
road 
trip 
to 

intercontinental boat trip, to train trip, even 
to a secret mode of transportation that only 
unlocks after you beat the game. The constant 
shifting of tone and structure in the game’s 
campaign might feel incoherent to some, but to 
me it provided much-needed variety to a genre 
that’s often held back by homogeneity. There’s 
really only one part of the game’s campaign that 
isn’t a blast — a lone chapter that drastically 
shifts tone to emulate survival horror gameplay. 
It’s a nice idea, but it’s not executed in a way 
that’s fun to play.

Besides hunting monsters and traveling, the 

player can also engage in one of my favorite 

fishing minigames I’ve ever played in a video 
game — rivaling even that of “Twilight Princess.” 
It’s a blast to take a break from the action and 
level up Noctis’ fishing skill. The other party 
members have special skills too, but they’re 
more passive — Prompto will take pictures over 
the course of the adventure that you can save 
to your hard drive, and Ignis will cook meals at 
campfires that grant helpful stat buffs. They’re 
fun little touches. This game has a lot of those.

I’m somewhat conflicted about how “FFXV” 

represents gender and race. Both the male and 
female characters are sexualized relatively 
equally (breasts, biceps and abs hang out 
EVERYWHERE in this game), which I’m 
more than fine with, but it seems like a missed 
opportunity to make every character in the 
party a light-skinned straight dude. What kind of 
dynamic would it bring if one of these beautiful 
anime boys liked other guys? How much would 
it have changed if one or more of the party was a 
girl? Why are there only two or three people of 
color in the entire world? But at the same time, 
I’m proud of the way that “FFXV” portrayed a 
nontraditional sort of heteromasculinity with 
its main characters. It allows them to show love 
for each other, dress in risqué black leather and 
talk to each other about their feelings without 
writing off any of those things as something not 
okay for straight guys to do.

Over the course of the campaign we’re 

allowed some real insight into the interpersonal 
relationships of the four boys, even beyond the 
(well-written) banter that’s frequently spouted 

in the car and on quests. There are social quests 
that very occasionally pop up that provide much-
needed breaks in tone — they kind of feel like 
the filler episodes of an anime where everyone 
goes to the beach for no reason, except they’re 
actually good. A scene that pops up randomly 
when you’re staying at a certain hotel between 
two of the boys is an emotional one that I’ll not 
forget for some time. There are times when the 
characters fight, make up, split off from one 
another and come back together again. It felt like 
there were tangible emotional highs and lows 
among the characters — I can’t think of another 
game where that’s been felt in recent years. I 
can’t say enough how much I enjoyed spending 
time with Noct, Gladio, Ignis, and Prompto. I 
would be remiss not to note how meme-worthy 
their dialogue can be at times, with Ignis in 
particular lending his voice to one of my favorite 
twitter memes I’ve seen in a long time.

It’s strange. On paper, “FFXV” is a number of 

combat encounters strung together with only a 
few interruptions from fishing minigames and 
sequences of travel. It doesn’t sound all that 
compelling. But because the game’s story is so 
excellently creative, its visuals so gorgeous, its 
style so unique, it becomes something much 
greater than the sum of its parts. It goes to show 
how far a dedication to world-building can go in 
making a superb video game. 

 It felt like there 
were tangible 

emotional highs 
and lows among 
the characters.

We open on a 
dusty, western 

highway, on 
which four 
gorgeous, 

primped anime 
boys are pushing 
a broken-down 

luxury car.

Hayden earns ninth at 
National Championship

For many competitors, the 
USA Diving Winter National 
Championships is a reprieve 
from the stressful academic 
and athletic workload that 
student athletes across the 
country 
face. 
With 
final 
exams in the rearview mirror, 
competing divers can put blue 
book essays behind them and 
focus solely on gold medals.
That 
is, 
unless 
you’re 
Michigan freshman Kristen 
Hayden.
Hayden 
traveled 
to 
Columbus on Monday, Dec. 19 
as the only Wolverine diver 
competing at the meet. Hayden 
had qualified for three events 
at the Championships, but 
because she had finals over the 
previous two weeks, she could 
only compete in the three-
meter springboard event. 
“Going into Monday, my 
expectation was basically to 
dive the best I could, the way 
I’ve been practicing,” Hayden 
said. “Then hopefully that was 
good enough to allow me to 
make it to finals on Wednesday.”
While she scored just a 
218.85 in the preliminaries, 

Hayden successfully improved 
her score to a 243.10 in the 
semifinals — good for ninth 
place overall, and enough to 
earn a spot in the final round 
of the event the following 
Wednesday. Many divers were 
able to use the time off to focus 
on the competition.
But 
Michigan’s 
finals 
schedule forced Hayden to 
quickly change her mindset 
after she got out of the pool.
“I had papers due after my 
semifinal, so that was a little 
bit different,” Hayden said. “I 
couldn’t just relax and focus 
on the meet, I also had to do 
my papers. The day before the 
competition, I was sitting at 
the pool typing a paper.”
Wednesday, Hayden stayed 
the course of her previous 
routines, 
scoring 
a 
678.00 
in the final round of dives. 
Overall, the performance put 
the freshman diver in 10th 
place for the event.
“We’re 
definitely 
using 
this meet to get ready for Big 
Tens and NCAAs,” Hayden 
said. “We’ve already talked 
about what I need to work on, 
and this is going to shoot me 
forward and get me ready for 
the rest of the season.”

Wolverines travel to Columbus for a 
contentious encounter with Ohio State

The 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball team is heading to 
Columbus this weekend to face 
one of its fiercest competitors 
yet — Ohio State.
The Buckeyes (3-0 Big Ten, 
13-4 overall) are ranked 11th 
in the Associated Press poll 
and 13th in the Coaches Poll, 
while the Wolverines (2-0 Big 
Ten, 13-3 overall) have failed 
to crack the top 25 in either. 
Yet, the two teams have nearly 
identical records and Michigan 
sits six spots ahead of Ohio State 
in the NCAA RPI rankings. The 
Buckeyes are favored, but the 
Wolverines have an opportunity 
to prove their superiority.
“Ohio State is led by a young 
lady named Kelsey Mitchell,” 
said coach Kim Barnes Arico 
on WTKA radio. “She’s an All-
American. She’s arguably the 
best player in the country. She’s 
a guard averaging about 26 
points a game.”
While the Wolverines don’t 
quite have a scoring equivalent 
of Mitchell, they do boast one 

of the deepest teams in the 
country. Seasoned junior guard 
and leading scorer Katelynn 
Flaherty averages 17.9 points 
per game, but it’s freshman 
guard Kysre Gondrezick who 
bolsters the depth.
Gondrezick broke into the 
Wolverines’ 
starting 
lineup 
against Rutgers on Dec. 28 
— a decision made based on 
her ability to score from the 
outside. Her uncanny ability to 
hit 3-pointers — she is shooting 
46.1% on the year — makes her 
tough to defend against.
“Earlier in the season, or 
especially last year, we felt 
if Katelynn had an off night 
we weren’t able to be really 
successful,” Barnes Arico said. 
“Now, Katelynn has drawn 
so much attention to herself. 
She’s usually guarded by the 
other team’s best player, and 
sometimes 
two 
people 
are 
running at her, and she faces 
double teams at times and 
faceguarding at times.
“It’s great to have other 
options and people that can take 
that pressure off of her, and Kysre 
has definitely provided that.”

Gondrezick put up big points 
in Michigan’s first two games of 
conference play, and shows no 
sign of slowing down. She had 
18 points and seven rebounds 
against Rutgers and another 
16 
points, 
including 
three 
3-pointers, in the Wolverines’ 
latest 
matchup 
against 
Wisconsin.
Sophomore 
forward 
Hallie 
Thome 
is 
the 
third 
offensive 
threat 
the 
Buckeyes 
will 
need to watch 
out for. Coming 
off her record-
breaking 
37-point 
performance 
against 
the 
Badgers, in which she tied for 
second highest points per game 
in Michigan history, Thome 
has shown that she can be 
extremely dangerous down low.
“I watched the film with 
my own children because they 
wanted to see,” Barnes Arico 
said. “And they were like, 
‘Mommy it’s almost like a layup 

drill for Hallie.’ Every time 
down the floor, it felt like she 
was scoring the basketball.”
If 
Thome, 
Flaherty 
and 
Gondrezick all perform at their 
peak, Ohio State will have to 
decide which Wolverine it needs 
to defend the most: the dangerous 
outside duo of Gondrezick and 
Flaherty or Thome’s long reach 
in the paint.
But, 
the 
Wolverines will 
need to return 
to their high-
scoring 
ways 
from the start 
of 
the 
season 
if they want to 
keep 
up 
with 
the 
Buckeyes. 
Not 
only 
has 
Ohio 
State 
matched 
Michigan’s 
record 
of three games in triple digits 
this season, but the Buckeyes 
have scored fewer than 80 
points in a game just twice. The 
Wolverines have played nine 
games in which they haven’t 
cracked that magic number.
With a serious defensive 
effort, Michigan is certainly 
capable of winning its third 
Big Ten game in a row. The 
Wolverines have lost to both 
No. 10 Florida State and No. 9 
UCLA, but both games were 
close. Michigan played each 
team after long flights to the 
Virgin Islands and California, 
putting the Wolverines way out 
of their comfort zones. A three-
hour bus ride to Columbus, 
could make conditions more 
favorable for Michigan.
The Wolverines have a solid 
chance at beating Ohio State, 
and their excitement shows.
“Our games with them the 
past few years have really been 
high-energy, high offense, fun 
to watch,” Barnes Arico said. “I 
think the rivalries between (us 
and) Ohio State and Michigan 
State are incredible. I don’t 
think 
anywhere 
in 
college 
athletics 
you 
have 
those 
rivalries like we do here at 
Michigan.”

Michigan hockey hosts alumni game with Red 
Wings to support former Wolverine Scott Matzka

When Scott Matzka committed 
to play hockey at Michigan before 
the 1997-98 season, he didn’t know 
what kind of culture he was joining. 
All he knew was the Wolverines 
had won the NCAA Championship 
in 1996, and it was widely known 
that they were a premier hockey 
program.
In 
Matzka’s 
first 
season, 
Michigan 
further 
cemented 
its place at the top of college 
hockey, winning another NCAA 
Championship 
over 
Boston 
College. It was the Wolverines’ 
ninth national title, which still 
stands as the most all-time.
But 
while 
Matzka 
had 
experienced much success in his 
collegiate career, he wouldn’t 
come to fully understand how 
impactful the Wolverines’ hockey 
community would be until more 
than a decade after he was done 
playing — namely, this Saturday 
night.
***
In 2014, Matzka spent a lot of 
time in the car. He was working 
in automotive plants and had been 
making drives to and from those 
plants since he had retired from 
playing hockey the year before.
But over time, Matzka started 
to realize that something wasn’t 
quite right with his body. When he 
reached to grab a pack of gum, his 
forearm would sometimes cramp 
up. When he would make a fist, it 
would sometimes be difficult to 
uncurl his fingers.
“I felt like — especially as an 
athlete — I understood my body 
pretty well,” Matzka said. “I was 
very active at that point. I was still 
working out at the time. I just knew 
something was off, but it was very, 
very early on at that point.”
So 
Matzka 
began 
doing 
research on his symptoms, and 
a single result kept coming up: 
amyotrophic 
lateral 
sclerosis. 

When his cramping and stiffness 
worsened, Matzka decided that 
it was time to see a doctor. But 
preliminary 
results 
from 
his 
general practitioner came back 
normal, and Matzka was referred 
to a neurologist to further examine 
his health.
Throughout 
August 
and 
September 
of 
2014, 
Matzka 
travelled 
around 
Michigan 
seeing different doctors. He 
eventually ended up at the 
University of Michigan, where a 
neurologist confirmed Matzka’s 
fears, and he was officially 
diagnosed with ALS. From there, 
Matzka began to realize the road 
ahead of him.
“It was probably 16 months 
before we sat down and started 
thinking about what we could do 
to be advocates for the disease,” 
Matzka said. “By that point, we 
started understanding some of 
the things we were going to face 
physically and financially. So we 
were really at the crossroads of 

‘OK, we want to do all these things.’ 
And by that point, we knew that my 
symptoms were severe enough that 
we had to, basically, shit or get off 
the pot.”
One 
of 
Matzka’s 
former 
employers created a website to 
help the Matzka family, where 
people could donate money to help 
with the costs of caring for an ALS 
patient. To date, Matzka estimates 
that the website has raised about 
33-50% of his family’s goal of 
$500,000 in the last six months.
For his own part, Matzka has 
taken it upon himself to spread 
awareness about ALS.
“We decided that my biggest 
impact was going to be in helping 
to spread awareness,” Matzka said. 
“So what we’ve done is, for the most 
part, we’ve spent time trying to tell 
my story everywhere that we can, 
and use that as a tool to empower 
everybody around us and other 
people, and then spread awareness 
about ALS, but then raise money 
towards the family.”

Matzka’s journey to spread 
awareness has taken him all 
around the world. Last October, 
he took part in an honorary puck 
drop prior to Michigan’s hockey 
game against Union, which was 
deemed an ALS Awareness game. 
Soon after, Matzka travelled to 
the United Kingdom to attend 
a fundraising game put on by 
another one of his former teams, 
the Cardiff Devils.
“It’s really an honor for us to be 
a part of things like that,” Matzka 
said. “There are 20,000 people 
facing this in the US right now, and 
every 90 seconds someone is newly 
diagnosed. So we’re not the only 
ones that are facing this, but we’re 
obviously in the unique position 
that we’ve been and done things 
that most people haven’t been able 
to do.
“I’m honored to be the one. 
Unfortunately, I hate to be the one. 
But until this disease is figured out, 
somebody’s got to do it, so I feel like 
I’m a good person to do that right 

now.”
***
Saturday, Matzka will witness 
another hockey game in his 
honor. But this time, he will be 
watching some of his former 
Michigan teammates — along 
with other Wolverine alumni — 
take on former Detroit Red Wings 
players.
It was an idea brought to Matzka 
by former teammate LJ Scarpace, 
who, along with the Michigan 
hockey team, went to work inviting 
retired players to return for the 
game.
“Really, we just sent out an 
e-mail asking for the guys that 
would like to play, to (former 
Michigan players),” said Michigan 
coach Red Berenson. “Clearly we 
got a great response.”
And while there are many 
occasions when Wolverine alumni 
come back to Yost, this one will be 
a bit more somber. But that doesn’t 
mean that Michigan alumni won’t 
be attending in force.

“It seems like we’re always 
having a reunion of a championship 
team 
or 
an 
anniversary 
of 
something 
special,” 
Berenson 
said. “But it’s not very often that 
we have a needy, or a sad or a real 
challenging situation like this one. 
And when you do, it’s amazing how 
the Michigan hockey family comes 
together. I mean, we have a lineup. 
We’ve got probably too many 
players. We have more players than 
we need, but good for them.”
And no matter the result, both 
Berenson and Matzka realize that 
the final score doesn’t matter. For 
them, the heavy response from 
former Wolverines has already 
made Saturday’s event a successful 
one.
“What it means to me is it just 
makes me proud to be a part of 
the Michigan hockey family, and 
the Michigan family, period,” 
Berenson said. “I know our fans 
are going to support this event, 
and I know our team, I think, 
will support it, and obviously the 
community. So it’s not a happy 
thing, but it’s an important thing.”
Added Matzka: “We’re going to 
have a ton of people that are going 
to get a chance to learn more about 
ALS, and are going to Google it and 
hopefully have an opportunity to 
take part in some of the events to 
raise money for the cause.”
In addition to simply raising 
awareness 
about 
the 
disease, 
Saturday will also serve as an 
opportunity for people to support 
Matzka himself, as all proceeds 
from the event will be donated to 
his personal fund. Matzka knows 
how much of a difference those 
donations can make.
“It’s going to help provide us 
with the opportunity to make 
quality of life choices versus 
making financial choices,” Matzka 
said. “We have to say, ‘Do I want to 
live with this disease and see my 
kids grow up a little bit more, or not 
have that ability?’ So that’s really 
what we’re looking for.”

Behind Enemy Lines: Talk with 
Maryland coach Mark Turgeon

The 
Maryland 
men’s 
basketball team will visit Crisler 
Center on Saturday for just 
the 
second 
time 
as 
a 
member 
of 
the Big Ten 
Conference.
Coach 
Mark 
Turgeon, 
in his third 
season in the 
conference, 
has 
overseen the 
Terrapins’ 
transition 
from 
the 
Atlantic 
Coast Conference to the Big 
Ten. Maryland has one of 
the youngest rosters in the 
conference this season, as 10 of 
its 16 players are underclassmen.
Turgeon gained experience 
coaching younger players last 
summer. He was an assistant 
coach 
on 
USA 
Basketball’s 
under-18 national team that won 
gold at the 2016 FIBA Americas 
U18 Championship.
The Daily sat down with 
Turgeon at Big Ten Media Day 
in October to discuss the Big 
Ten 
Tournament’s 
move 
to 
Washington D.C., his experience 
coaching with USA Basketball 
and the challenges Maryland 
faced switching from the ACC to 
the Big Ten.
The Michigan Daily: Coach, 
you talked previously about how 
excited you are about having 
the Big Ten Tournament in 
Washington D.C. What does it 
mean to have the tournament 
here next March?
Mark Turgeon: As far as I 
can remember, Maryland fans 

have always had to travel for 
their tournament. So it’s good 
to have it here. It was part of 
the promise when we went into 
the league that we would have 
a tournament here in DC and 
in New York. It’s good it has 
happened so quickly. I’m really 
happy for our fans not having to 
travel as far, to save a little bit of 
money and getting to see quality 
basketball in their backyard.
TMD: When you coached 
the USA under-18 team over 
the summer, what, as a coach, 
do you gain coaching at the 
international level and outside 
Maryland?
MT: I think it was just great 
to be a part of USA Basketball. 
That was fun. I got to hang 
around other coaches in (Texas 
coach) 
Shaka 
Smart 
and 
(Connecticut coach) Kevin Ollie 

and be around great players, and 
then travel the world a little bit. 
It was a good experience, as far 
as we won the gold, so it was a 
good time.
TMD: What experiences can 
you particularly bring back from 
the under-18 tournament and 
instill at Maryland?
MT: You steal a little bit from 
Shaka Smart, you steal a little bit 
from Kevin Ollie, and I’m sure 
I helped them a little bit too. 

Then you’re dealing with the 
best players who are under 18 
and you realize you have pretty 
good players too (at Maryland). 
Just the experience (of) being 
with the coaches and being in 
tournament play and preparing 
guys in a short time, it all helps 
you as a coach move forward.
TMD: Has there been a 
difference for you between how 
basketball was played in the 
ACC and the Big Ten?
MT: I think basketball is 
basketball. 
Every 
league 
is 
different, yet every league is 
the same. What I mean by that 
is, there’s 14 teams, so you’re 
going to have a lot of different 
teams. You’re going to have 
coaches that play fast, coaches 
that play slow, teams that are 
really physical and teams that 
are finesse. And you have that 
in every league. I think the 
biggest difference in the leagues 
is just the venues and the crowd 
support. It’s just amazing in the 
Big Ten, and it’s hard to win on 
the road.
TMD: Was there any learning 
curve for you in your first couple 
years in the Big Ten?
MT: I’ve been in a lot of 
leagues as a coach. I’ve been 
able to adjust everywhere I 
went. I think I had an advantage 
the first year because none of 
the teams knew my system and 
we had a great year (finishing) 
14-4. In terms of the learning 
curve, are we much better 
guarding Michigan’s stuff than 
we were when we first entered 
the league? Yes, it’s a complex 
offense. There is a learning 
curve in everything you do. 
They also had a learning curve 
with us to learn our system. 
We feel pretty locked in, pretty 
comfortable with where we are 
and our understanding of the 
teams.

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Surprising outcomes throughout the start of the Big Ten 
season could give Michigan better shot in the conference 

The Michigan men’s basketball 
team may have a fighting chance 
in the Big Ten after all.
The Wolverines started their 
conference slate with an 86-83 
overtime loss to Iowa, before 
notching 
a 
come-from-behind 
victory against Penn State at 
Crisler Center on Wednesday 
night.
If not for a handful of wasted 
possessions in Iowa City, Michigan 
(1-1 Big Ten, 11-4 overall) could 
be sitting in a three-team tie for 
second place in the conference 
standings.
But the Wolverines don’t have 
the luxury of wondering what 
could have been, as they will 
play their third Big Ten game of 
this week against Maryland on 
Saturday.
Though the Terrapins boast a 
13-2 overall record, the majority 
of those wins have come against 
inferior 
competition. 
And 
Maryland’s losses to Nebraska and 
Pittsburgh — the latter of which 
was a 73-59 blowout — have shown 
that it is vulnerable. 
Still, 
led 
by 
guard 
Melo 
Trimble, who is fourth in the Big 
Ten with 17.8 points per game, 
the Terrapins should prove to be a 
significant test for Michigan.
Maryland’s 
loss 
to 
the 
Cornhuskers is one example of 
an early and chaotic conference 
landscape, but it’s worth noting 
that Big Ten play only began Dec. 
27.
Either way, those surprises 
have given Michigan a confidence 
boost that it can play with any of 
its opponents.
“We make sure we know that, 
we look at that,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein on Tuesday. 
“…So I think the thing is that, you 
know, this is a long season and 
anybody can beat anybody, and 
that you better be ready for every 
game.

“And that there’s a lot of teams 
will start slow. Sometimes (it’s) 
just scheduling, sometimes it is 
just a matter of just not being 
ready or injury or something like 
that.”
Added 
redshirt 
sophomore 
forward DJ Wilson: “I think it 
just shows how good the Big Ten 
is, and there’s not really a big drop 
off from the first and last. It’s all 
kind of just even, and I think that’s 
something we just need to take 
our chances and kind of just attack 
it, get as many wins as we can and 
take advantage of it.”
While the Big Ten season 
is still young, the quest for the 
conference title is shaping up to be 
an unpredictable battle, and with 
that, the Daily breaks down what 
has happened across conference 
play so far.
Michigan State (3-0, 11-5)
Tom Izzo’s Spartans fell prey to 
tough scheduling in the early part 

of the season, as they dropped 
games against No. 2 Baylor, No. 6 
Kentucky, No. 8 Duke and No. 17 
Arizona before swallowing a bad 
loss to Northeastern.
The start of Big Ten play, though, 
seems to have helped Michigan 
State return to its expected form. 
The Spartans have rattled off 
three wins against Minnesota, 
Northwestern 
and 
Rutgers, 
a 
stretch during which they are 
averaging 76.3 points per game.
Through 
that 
three-game 
stretch, 
Michigan 
State 
has 
showcased an ability to score from 
anywhere on the floor. Forward 
Nick Ward posted 22 points 
against 
the 
Golden 
Gophers, 
guard Alvin Ellis III notched 16 
against the Wildcats and guard 
Eron Harris recorded 24 against 
the Scarlet Knights.
Even more impressive is that 
the Spartans managed to start 
conference play 2-0 without their 

freshman phenom Miles Bridges, 
who sustained an ankle injury in 
the matchup against Duke that 
sidelined him for over a month. 
Despite the injury, the young 
forward is averaging 15.4 points 
and 8.4 rebounds per game.
With Bridges healthy again, and 
a versatile offense coming into its 
own, Michigan State looks poised 
to maintain its status among the 
Big Ten’s best.
No. 13 Wisconsin (2-0, 13-2)
This season has gone as expected 
for the Badgers so far, as they have 
just two losses on the year.
The first was against then-No. 
22 Creighton, but that loss looks 
a lot better now that the Blue Jays 
have jumped to 10th in the AP Top 
25. The second, a 71-56 blowout, 
came against then-No. 4 North 
Carolina.
But the Badgers dismantled 
Rutgers 
in 
their 
conference 
opener before beating Indiana in 

Bloomington.
Wisconsin returned all five 
starters this year, and through 
15 games, each has continued to 
produce at a high level. Forward 
Ethan Happ is nearly averaging 
a double-double with 13.1 points 
and 9.4 rebounds per game, 
while guard Bronson Koenig and 
forward Nigel Hayes are averaging 
14.3 and 13.7 points, respectively.
While it’s still early, it appears 
everything is going according to 
plan in Madison.
Nebraska (2-0, 8-6)
At 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
season, the Cornhuskers were an 
afterthought in the Big Ten. As 
their non-conference schedule 
rolled on, that sentiment seemed 
to gain more validity.
Granted, Nebraska’s schedule 
was difficult — it faced No. 3 
Kansas, No. 4 UCLA, No. 10 
Creighton, No. 21 Virginia Tech 
and Clemson. But after losing 

each of those games, in addition 
to another against Gardner-Webb, 
the Cornhuskers certainly weren’t 
turning any heads.
Their start to Big Ten play, 
though, has made some noise.
Nebraska opened with a win 
at then-No. 16 Indiana, before 
toppling Maryland in College 
Park. While the Cornhuskers won 
both games by a combined margin 
of just nine points, those wins 
have been both impressive and 
unexpected.
Over the two contests, guards 
Glynn Watson Jr. and Tai Webster 
averaged 21.5 and 19.5 points, 
respectively.
There’s no way of telling if that 
kind of production is sustainable, 
but if it is, Nebraska may turn the 
Big Ten on its head.
No. 25 Indiana (0-2, 10-5)
The Hoosiers couldn’t have 
asked for a much better start to 
the season.
After winning two exhibitions, 
Indiana toppled No. 3 Kansas 
at the State Farm Armed Forces 
Classic in Honolulu and notched 
a win against then-No. 3 North 
Carolina on Nov. 30. But since 
those 
marquee 
victories, 
the 
Hoosiers have struggled.
They 
faltered 
against 
No. 
18 Butler and are currently on 
a three-game losing streak — 
dropping two Big Ten matchups 
against Nebraska and No. 13 
Wisconsin, and another against 
No. 9 Louisville.
Still, it doesn’t appear to be time 
for Indiana to hit the panic button.
Nebraska and Wisconsin are 
undefeated in the Big Ten, and 
guard James Blackmon Jr. is still 
sixth in the Big Ten in scoring 
with 16.8 points per game.
While their start has come 
as a shock, with guard Robert 
Johnson, center Thomas Bryant 
and 
forward 
OG 
Anunoby 
each 
averaging 
double 
digits 
surrounding 
Blackmon, 
the 
Hoosiers appear to have the pieces 
in place to right the ship.
