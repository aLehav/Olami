Many of us arrived 

on campus with MCards 

dangling from our necks and 

oversized TCF sweatshirts in our 

hands. Since then, we’ve witnessed 
the inauguration of the University 
of Michigan’s 14th president, Mark 

Schlissel. We’ve sat patiently, waiting for the 
announcement of not one, but two snow days. 
We’ve cheered on the arrival of Jim Harbaugh, 

the perennial “Michigan Man.” We’ve frozen 
while waiting in the frigid weather for tickets 
to see President Barack Obama speak at the 

Intramural Building, and we’ve protested 
police brutality and sexual assault in the 

streets of Ann Arbor. We can picture where 

we were at each of these moments, moments 

that defined our college experience 
and unified our campus. Today we 
leave behind a school, a city and a 

community that looks significantly 

different than the one we 

arrived at in 2012.

SEPTEMBER 2: Following a Title IX mandate from the 
Department of Education, the University adopted a new sexual 
misconduct policy that placed the burden of investigation 

on the Office of Institutional Equity. The policy would 

be revised again in 2016 to tighten sanctions and the 

definition of consent. 

NOVEMBER 19: A Twitter campaign led by the Black 

Student Union gained national prominence as Black students 

joined an online conversation on issues of race and diversity at 
the University. More than 10,000 tweets called out low minority 
enrollment and bias incidents on campus.

would be canceled for the first time since 1978.

Previous Greek 
life scandals lead 
to call for change 

by University 

President

By EMMA KINERY 

and LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporters

University President Mark 

Schlissel 
discussed 
alcohol 

abuse and sexual assault — 
problems he said are rampant 
among the Greek community — 
during a gathering of students 
from every chapter of University 
Greek life Thursday.

The meeting marked the first 

of its kind, in which members 
of every University Greek life 
chapter gathered for the first 
time in their 170-year history on 
campus.

Schlissel’s argument centered 

on the ways in which an 
unfettered party culture stains 
the University’s reputation — 
not only for current students, 
but for the 500,000 people who 
graduated before them.

“The value of their degrees 

are gonna go down because the 
reputation of the University 
of 
Michigan 
won’t 
be 
the 

excitement in the Big House or 
our teams doing well under our 
fantastic new coach,” Schlissel 
said. “It’s not gonna be the 
kids who receive the Rhodes 
Scholarships and the Fulbright 
Scholarships, and the famous 
professors who do the work that 
you’re going to get reflected on 
for, or the National Medal for 
the Arts that our faculty won 
this past week. It’s going to be 
the ‘Shmacked’ videos. So it’s 
really up to you what the value 
of your education is going to 
be, what the reputation of this 
institution’s going to be.”

The talk was met with mixed 

reactions, with some students 
coughing loudly when Schlissel, 
along with other administrators, 
mentioned problems such as 
low Greek participation in the 
University’s 
sexual 
assault 

survey, among other issues.

Each fraternity and sorority 

was required to have at least 
70 percent of its chapter attend 
the meeting. Those that failed 
to comply will face a semester 
of social probation, a letter to 
their national organization and 
a $1,000 fine.

The meeting comes after a 

year of magnified tumult in 
the Greek community, marked 
by national press coverage of 
numerous fraternity “ski trips” 
gone wrong last winter, in 
addition to increased scrutiny of 
the role of Greek life in excessive 
party 
culture 
in 
university 

settings throughout the country.

Dean of Students Laura Blake 

Jones told members of Greek 
life that the issues facing their 
community are grave.

“I fear some of you have 

embraced a work-hard, play-
hard mentality and that you 
may have taken to the extreme 
what has us on this downward 
spiral, and we know we have 
to turn this around,” she said. 
“It’s clear to me that if we can’t 
begin 
to 
make 
meaningful, 

student-led progress and change 
immediately on our campus, the 
future of sorority and fraternity 
life as we know it is in peril.”

Issues on campus
Though Greek life represents 

just 22 percent of students 
on 
campus, 
administrators 

emphasized 
the 
influence 

members 
wield 
on 
campus 

culture.

Thursday’s meeting comes 

as administrators continue to 
emphasize the dire need for 
culture change in the Greek 
community — a point with 
which Blake Jones opened the 
conversation.

“I’m hoping tonight will be 

remembered as a turning point 
when the Greek community 
came 
together, 
reinforced 

and 
recognized 
its 
positive 

attributes, 
contributions 
and 

influence 
and 
was 
willing 

to 
thoughtfully 
reflect 
and 

consider the need for significant 
changes in the community,” 
Blake Jones said.

In particular, administrators 

said they fear the impact of 
Greek life-organized parties on 
the University’s image.

Blake 
Jones 
said 
the 

popularity of the 2012 “I’m 
Shmacked” 
video 
— 
which 

showcased and glorified the 
party scene featuring University 
students — ultimately casts a 
shadow over the institution. The 
result: potential students are 
drawn in for the wrong reasons 
or others are turned off for fear 
of a wild social scene.

This 
was 
a 
point 
that 

Mary Jo Desprez, director of 
Wolverine 
Wellness, 
spoke 

to 
in 
anexclusive 
interview 

with The Michigan Daily on 

Sept. 4. She said balancing this 
kind of negative picture of the 
University with more positive 
messages that better reflect the 
school’s values is increasingly 
difficult in the digital age.

“The one thing that’s different 

today that we didn’t have to deal 
with 10 or 15 years ago is the 
24/7 instant visual of party,” she 
said. “For those of you who saw 
‘I’m Shmacked’ and how quickly 
that went around and how many 
views it got — now you’re a 10th 
grader looking at the schools you 
want to go to and you type in the 
University of Michigan. U of M’s 
admissions tour had like 70,000 
(views) and the ‘I’m Shmacked’ 
had 800,000 ... so who’s doing 
your recruiting and does that 
change the way people decide to 
come to schools?

“That might have been 1,000 

students in that video, but we 
have 43,000 students here, and 
now you have a video that we’ll 
never be able to get rid of that 
sort of shows our campus, but 
it shows this one teeny-tiny bit 
of the story,” Desprez added. 
“We’ll never get that sort of 
traction with any counter story.”

The 
virality 
of 
“I’m 

Shmacked” 
seems 
to 
be 

representative of what Schlissel 
sees as an increasingly poor 
understanding 
of 
what 
it 

means to have “fun” at school. 
Referencing his roles as a father 
and, previously, a practicing 
doctor, Schlissel emphasized the 
negative effect the party climate 
can have on students’ health.

“I don’t like the idea that 

we measure how good or bad a 
weekend was by how many of 
you ended up in an ambulance 
taken to our emergency room,” 
he said. “That’s not how we 
should measure how good a time 
we are having.”

According to the Campus 

Climate Survey taken last year 
and released over the summer, 
students involved in Greek life 
have a 40-percent higher chance 
of experiencing sexual assault.

At the meeting, E. Royster 

Harper, 
vice 
president 
for 

student life, stressed that the 
perception of Greek life on 
campus isn’t always positive.

“There 
are 
others 
in 

the 
community 
that 
see 

your behavior as racist and 
homophobic and sexist and 
unsafe,” she said. “Some see you 
as giving back to the community 
and others see you as sucking 
the life out of the community. 

Severe cold causes 
first cancellation of 
classes in 36 years

By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA 

and MAX RADWIN

Daily News Editor and Daily 

Staff Reporter

For the first time since 1978, the 

University has canceled classes 
Tuesday due to extreme weather, 
University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald 
confirmed 
Monday 

evening.

According 
to 
the 
National 

Weather Service, temperatures 
will be at a high of 2 degrees, with 
a wind chill reaching -30 degrees 
and winds reaching up to 20 miles 
per hour.

Campus buildings — including 

dining halls and libraries — 
will 
remain 
open. 
University 

transportation 
services 
will 

continue operating as normal, 
though delays should be expected.

This announcement marks the 

first time that the University has 
cancelled classes due to weather-
related circumstances since Ann 
Arbor was hit with 19 inches of 
snow in 1978.

University Police spokeswoman 

Diane 
Brown 
said 
University 

Police will be taking extra efforts 
to keep response times low to limit 
the amount of time that people 
spend outside in the cold.

After 
Fitzgerald 
confirmed 

the decision, University Provost 
Martha Pollack, Chief Health 

Officer 
Robert 
Winfield 
and 

Laurita Thomas, associate vice 
president for human resources, 
sent a memo to faculty and staff 
encouraging 
flexibility 
and 

telecommuting if possible for 
Tuesday.

“Campus 
operations 
will 

continue,” 
the 
memo 
said. 

“However, while staff should plan 
to report as usual, we ask that 
supervisors be flexible and make 
reasonable accommodations for 
these 
extreme 
circumstances. 

Travel 
may 
be 
hazardous, 

especially on foot or by bus, and 
we ask that all of our colleagues 
remain sensitive to safety concerns. 
Parking 
and 
Transportation 

Services 
is 
increasing 
bus 

frequency to help minimize wait 
times.”

The memo added that staff who 

are “unable or choose not to” travel 
to campus Tuesday should contact 
their supervisors to use vacation 
time or unpaid time off.

Medical School Prof. Charles 

Koopmann, a member of the 
Senate Advisory Committee on 
University Affairs, said he feels 
it’s “unfortunate” that staff on 
main campus have to come in or 
be forced to take a day of vacation. 
However, he said he believes that 
the medical campus should remain 
open, which, according to the 
memo, will operate normally.

“The University needs to get a 

well organized plan for something 
like this and should remarkably 
improve 
communications,” 

Koopmann said.

After the controversy over not 

closing campus during the Polar 

Vortex earlier this month, Pollack 
sat in on the Senate Advisory 
Committee for University Affairs 
meeting Jan. 13 to discuss the 
University’s decision to not cancel 
classes.

“By the time it became clear that 

we were facing an extraordinary 
weather 
event, 
we 
realized 

that we didn’t have appropriate 
mechanisms to close the University 
even if we wanted to,” Pollack said.

During that meeting, Pollack 

said 
the 
University 
planned 

to 
establish 
a 
committee 
to 

address 
emergency 
situations, 

including weather, that merit the 
cancellation of classes.

Though that committee was 

formed and held one meeting 
last week, Fitzgerald said the 
decision to cancel classes Tuesday 
was made independently of that 
committee, in consultation with 
the the Office of the Provost, 
Winfield and Thomas.

“This is a decision that was made 

based on the unique circumstances 
that are being presented with the 
weather forecasts for tomorrow,” 
Fitzgerald said. “This is not a 
reflection of any new protocol.”

Business 
senior 
Michael 

Proppe, CSG president, said he 
believes the dangerous conditions 
Tuesday warranted the historic 
measure.

“It’s really going to be cold 

tomorrow, I think the University 
made the right call,” Proppe said. 
“When it’s -25 degrees out with the 
wind chill and you have students 
walking 10, 15, or 20 minutes 
to class, it can be dangerous to 
have skin exposed in that kind of 
weather.”

Proppe said he was surprised 

because 
such 
a 
decision 
is 

“unprecedented,” but added that 
he knows the University has 
students safety at the forefront.

“Though CSG did not play an 

active role in today’s decision, 
executive 
members 
brought 

up the school’s lack of a severe 
weather policy in their last 
few meetings with the dean of 
students, Laura Blake Jones,” 
Proppe said.

While many students may 

spend tomorrow binge-watching 
Netflix or enjoying some other 
form of leisure, Proppe said his 
cold day will likely consist of 
catching up on homework and 
CSG related projects.

Eastern Michigan University 

and 
Washtenaw 
Community 

College also have canceled classes 
for Tuesday. According to the 
Twitter of the State News Twitter, 
Michigan 
State 
University 

spokesperson Kent Cassella said 
that MSU is expected to “continue 
operations as usual.”

St. Joseph County in Indiana, 

where Notre Dame is located, is 
under a state of emergency and 
driving after 7 p.m. is subject to a 
$2,500 fine.

day after sub-zero temperatures

NOVEMBER 6: U.S. President Barack Obama was 
re-elected, winning 51.1 percent of the popular vote over 
Republican candidate Gov. Mitt Romney (R–Mass.). Many 

students gathered in the Diag to celebrate Obama’s victory. 

He was the first president since 1956 to win at least 51 

percent of the popular vote twice. 

SEPTEMBER 1 “I’m Schmacked” video was filmed 

over Welcome Week featuring University students drinking 

and partying. The video was met with backlash from students 
and the University for portraying the University in a negative 
light. University spokesman Rick Fitzgerland condemned the 
videomakers for “taking advantage of the situation” and said the 
video has “no redeeming value.”

Black Student Union 
issues seven demands 
aimed at increasing 
campus diversity

By SAM GRINGLAS and ALICIA 

ADAMCZYK

Daily Staff Reporter and Daily 

News Editor

University 
students 
took 
to 

Twitter in droves Tuesday afternoon 
to 
share 
their 
experiences 
as 

Black students in Ann Arbor and 
bring attention to issues of race 
and diversity on campus using the 
hashtag #BBUM.

“Being Black at the University of 

Michigan has many shades and many 
levels to what someone might want to 
speak on it. It can go from someone 
being the only Black person in their 
class to someone with no problems 
at all.”

-LSA senior Eric Gavin
The campaign, initiated by the 

University’s Black Student Union, 
has built up over the past few 
days before trending nationally 
on Twitter Tuesday. The hashtag 
gained momentum after the student 
organization distributed an e-mail 
to community members and other 
campus 
groups 
encouraging 

them to participate in the online 
conversation.

LSA senior Tyrell Collier, BSU’s 

president, said the #BBUM campaign 
was planned to raise awareness of the 
experiences of Black students and for 
the BSU to collect subjective data it 
can couple with University statistics 
to address pressing issues Black 
students face.

Collier said BSU encouraged 

students to tweet both negative and 
positive experiences, though the 
tweets have been predominantly 
negative, which he expected.

He said the issue is especially 

pressing on campus because while 
the University frequently discusses 
ways to increase diversity, many 
communities have yet to witness 
tangible results.

“I would like to see the lives of 

Black students valued more,” Collier 
said.

By 10 p.m., over 10,000 tweets 

included the hashtag from Ann Arbor 
and beyond.

“I don’t think this is a problem 

specific to the University, I think it’s 
an experience that Black students at 
predominantly White universities 
across the nation are facing,” he said 
of the far-reaching responses.

Black enrollment at the University 

has fallen precipitously over the past 
decade largely due to Proposal 2, an 

amendment to the state constitution 
that bans affirmative action policies 
that was passed by Michigan voters 
in 2006. The proposal, formally 
named the Michigan Civil Rights 
Initiative, bars the University from 
considering race in its admissions 
process.

Immediately after the passage of 

the proposal, University President 
Mary Sue Coleman gave a dramatic 
address on the Diag promising 
to 
maintain 
the 
University’s 

commitment to diversity. However, 
the institution has been unable 
to stanch the decline in minority 
enrollment 
through 
alternative 

outreach policies in the wake of the 
affirmative action ban.

In Fall 2006, Black students made 

up around seven percent of the 
undergraduate population. In Fall 
2013, the University reported that 
Black 
undergraduate 
enrollment 

had fallen to 4.65 percent. Hispanic 
enrollment as a percentage of the 
overall undergraduate body also 
declined over the same period.

At a search forum for the next 

University president in September, 
the Presidential Search Advisory 
Committee — which includes the 
University’s Board of Regents — 
heard from a number of students 
about 
diversity 
issues. 
Several 

student speakers at the event said 
many minorities feel they lack a 
voice on campus and occasionally 
experience bias incidents with both 
students and instructors.

Collier said the University has not 

yet contacted BSU about Tuesday’s 
campaign. University spokesman 
Rick Fitzgerald stressed that the 
University’s next step will be to listen 
to the students and their experiences 
on campus.

“I think at this point the listening 

is the most important part and how 
we might respond is the next step 
and we haven’t gotten there yet,” 
Fitzgerald said.

He said the University is aware of 

students’ concerns and recognizes 
that there is always room for 
improvement in any organization.

However, the University’s social 

media team responded to the 
campaign 
via 
Twitter 
Tuesday 

afternoon: “Thanks for engaging in 
this conversation. We’re listening, 
and will be sure all of your voices are 
heard. #BBUM”

E. Royster Harper, the University’s 

vice president for student life, created 
a Twitter account late Tuesday to 
address the issue.

“Got on Twitter to hear and 

support your voices. Proud of our 
students. More later,” Harper wrote.

LSA senior Eric Gavin, BSU’s 

public relations chair, said several 
recent campus events spurred the 

organization to plan a campaign, 
including 
a 
recent 
controversy 

involving 
Theta 
Xi 
fraternity 

members who branded a party with 
racialized images and words.

BSU also timed its Twitter 

campaign to correspond with a 
forum this evening hosted by the 
Department of Afroamerican and 
African Studies, the Black Student 
Union, 
We 
are 
Michigan 
and 

Students of Color of Rackham.

BSU hopes to not only engage 

members of its organization but also 
Black campus leaders from an array 
of groups, Gavin said. However, 
leaders didn’t believe the student 
organization would receive national 
attention for its efforts.

“I definitely could not have 

foreseen 
the 
national 
attention 

we have garnered in such a short 
amount of time,” Gavin said. “We felt 
it necessary to push for an initiative 
that would bring more awareness to 
these issues and to the larger Black 
community.”

Though traditional methods such 

as campus demonstrations play a role 
in raising awareness, Gavin said BSU 
decided social media could serve as 
an additional method for sparking 
dialogue.

“It kept it open ended and that’s 

why it so successful,” Gavin said. 
“The hashtag leaves for open ended 
interpretation so people can say 
what they feel instead of imposing 
somebody’s thoughts on them.”

So far, students have voiced an 

array of perspectives.

“Being Black at the University 

of Michigan has many shades 
and many levels to what someone 
might want to speak on it,” Gavin 
said. “It can go from someone 
being the only Black person in 
their class to someone with no 
problems at all. It’s a spectrum, 
but we want people to be aware 
of everyone’s different ideas on 
the issue of being Black at the 
University of Michigan.”

Renowned journalist Michele 

Norris, the creator of the Race 
Card Project — a nationwide 
initiative 
that 
gathers 

perspectives on race and aims 
to foster dialogue on the subject 
— partnered with the University 
during 
last 
winter’s 
theme 

semester on race, and will give 
the 2013 Winter Commencement 
address.

In a form similar to BSU’s 

campaign, Norris used Twitter 
to broaden the reach of the Race 
Card Project because she said 
even though the social media 
platform only allots users only 
140 characters, it’s a powerful 
way to stimulate uncomfortable 
conversations.

“I used to say the most productive 

conversations are the private ones, 
but Twitter made me rethink that,” 
Norris said.

Norris noted that the University 

did not “take cover” once the dialogue 
took off, but rather embraced the 
campaign and encouraged students 
to take part in the conversation, 
which is not always the norm for 
large institutions.

“This is an honest conversation,” 

she said. “They wanted to see an 
honest conversation and that’s what 
this is, as uncomfortable as this may 
be for people to read about this.”

She said diversity has been an 

issue on every college campus she 
has visited, and after reading the 
tweets from Tuesday’s discussion at 
Michigan, it is likely the topic isn’t 
going to subside once the Twitter 
debate dies down.

“It really was not just people 

talking about their own experiences, 
but it turned into an actual dialogue,” 
she said. “People were talking to each 
other and perhaps even learning from 
each other, and more importantly 
listening to each other.”

Norris 
added 
that 
she 
will 

likely address the issue in her 
commencement address next month.

By asking students to share their 

experiences as Black students on 
campus, BSU is hoping to not only 
bring light to challenges, but also to 
call other student leaders to action.

Some see only the worst in 
you and others only the best.”

Schlissel said the issues 

described are best dealt with 
at 
the 
student-leadership 

level because students are 
more willing to cooperate 
with the changes if they are 
promoted by fellow members 
of Greek life.

He noted, however, that 

the problems don’t have a 
short-term solution.

“They’re 
culture 

problems,” 
Schlissel 
said. 

“They’re aspects of how our 
culture and our behavior line 
up with our values and who 
we think we are — who we 
say we are.”

A turning point for Greek 

life

Blake Jones said the need 

for a turning point for Greek 
life has been on the horizon 
for some time, and that the 
problems were evident for 
many years prior to the high-
profile 
Treetops 
ski 
trip 

incident in January.

Over 
the 
summer, 

administrators began taking 
steps to curb these incidents 
by developing a task force 
composed of four leaders 
from the four branches of the 
Greek community: LSA senior 
Alex Krupiak, Interfraternity 
Council president; Business 
senior 
Maddy 
Walsh, 

Panhellenic 
Association 

president; LSA senior Reid 
McManus, 
National 
Pan-

Hellenic Council president; 
and LSA senior Kelly Gee, 
Multicultural Greek Council 
president.

At February’s meeting of 

the University’s Board of 
Regents, Walsh said leaders 
from the Greek community 
were 
planning 
to 
work 

with the University to shift 
Greek life culture. During 
Thursday’s event, Walsh told 
the assembled crowd that the 
taskforce had created a plan 
to improve the reputation 
of Greek life members on 
campus.

The 
first 
part 
of 
the 

plan 
requires 
all 
Greek 

organizations to participate 
in 
the 
Achievement 

Expectations 
Program, 

which 
mandates 
that 
all 

chapters record and submit 
to 
the 
University 
their 

philanthropic and service-
hour achievements. Walsh 
noted that last year, Greek 
students 
raised 
roughly 

$150,000 of the $450,000 
raised for Dance Marathon.

Walsh 
also 
addressed 

concern 
over 
social 
life 

and the Greek system. She 
recommended 
chapters 

reduce the size and visibility 
of their parties to downplay 
the 
association 
between 

parties 
and 
Greek 
life. 

She said this reduces the 
liability and risk of hosting 
many 
potentially 
non-

Greek students, who could 
be the ones destroying the 
reputation 
of 
Greek 
life. 

Another suggestion: reduce 
the amount of hard liquor at 
Greek parties.

Gee, 
the 
Multicultural 

Greek 
Council 
president, 

said the Greek community is 
working to improve diversity 
and 
inclusion. 
Until 
this 

meeting, the four branches 
of Greek life did not ever 
meet together for this type of 
discussion. Next year, a Greek 
life Diversity and Inclusion 
taskforce will be launched for 
that purpose.

Walsh 
said 
compared 

to 
other 
universities 

nationwide, the University’s 
practices for dealing with 
alcohol and other behavioral 
issues appear fairly advanced.

“We contacted universities 

across the country and found, 
to some extent, we are above 
the 
curve,” 
Walsh 
said. 

“Campuses with problematic 
Greek life communities are 
implementing sober monitors 
and social behavior policies 
which are things our Greek 
community at Michigan has 
had since the early 1990s.”

Frequent, 
loud 
coughs 

echoed 
throughout 
the 

auditorium 
and 
were 

regarded by several speakers 
as a purposeful disruption 
and show of disrespect.

As 
Schlissel 
spoke, 

members coughed so loudly 
that Harper, the following 
speaker, 
said 
while 
she 

rarely is intimidated by a 
large crowd, the negative 
atmosphere created by the 
coughing made her rethink 
her words.

Administrators 
weren’t 

the only ones to comment 
on the behavior. Krupiak, 
the IFC president, noted the 
display in his final comments.

“Think for a second about 

how 
much 
your 
chapter 

means to you,” Krupiak said. 
“I know it means a hell of a lot 
to me … But when students sit 
here and blatantly disrespect 
the leaders of our University 
and 
fellow 
students 
like 

myself and the three behind 
me, it’s flat-out embarrassing 
to say I’m a member of Greek 
life today.”

#BBUM twitter campaign garners 
national attention to the University 

JANUARY 28: For the first time since 1978, the 
University canceled classes due to extreme cold, with 
windchill at about -30 degrees Fahrenheit. The University 
established a committee to address campus closure during 
severe weather conditions and updated its policies in October. 

SEPTEMBER 5: Mark Schlissel was inaugurated as 
the 14th president of the University of Michigan following 
the retirement of Mary Sue Coleman. During his inaugural 
address, Schlissel emphasized building diversity and 
creating an inclusive atmosphere on campus. 

SEPTEMBER 10: After a spate of scandals involving Greek 
life at Michigan — including the Treetops Resort vandalism 
incident — University President Mark Schlissel told an 

assembly of members from each University Greek life chapter 

that their behavior devalues the University. 

NOVEMBER 10: The University filed an amicus brief 

with the United States Supreme Court in defense of the 

University of Texas’s race-conscious admission policies in the 

case Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin. Michigan was barred 
from explicitly using race-based affirmative action in a 2006 
state vote, and the amicus brief argued this has prevented the 
University from achieving racial diversity.

FEBRUARY 9: Nearly 100 protesters marched to the Diag, 
calling to recall governor Rick Snyder for negligence in relation to 
the Flint water crisis. The Flint water crisis began in April 2014 

with a switch in water supply, resulting in lead contamination of 

the water supply. Residents faced adverse health effects, but 

the supply was not switched back for nearly 18 months.

MARCH 8: Businessman Donald Trump and Sen. Bernie 

Sanders (D–Vt.) won the Michigan presidential primary. 

Sanders’ victory was a historic upset as polls predicted Hillary 
Clinton winning by a margin of approximately 20 points, but 
Sanders ended up winning the state in a tight race. The state 
also had record high turnout numbers, and students on campus 
appeared to lean towards Sanders.

Former Brown 

provost promises to 
focus on diversity 

and dialogue

By CLAIRE BRYAN

Daily Staff Reporter

It’s official.
Students, 
faculty 
and 

administrators 
filled 
Hill 

Auditorium 
Friday 
afternoon 

for University President Mark 
Schlissel’s 
inauguration, 
the 

ceremony where he was formally 
installed as the University’s 14th 
president.

With speeches from Republican 

Gov. Rick Snyder; University 
Provost Martha Pollack; Ruth 
Simmons, 
Brown 
University 

president emerita; and Schlissel 
himself, the inauguration focused 
on the significant issues facing 
modern public higher education.

In 
his 
inaugural 
address, 

Schlissel articulated his vision for 
a University community marked 
by inclusiveness, accessibility and 
a vibrant civil exchange of diverse 
viewpoints.

“I firmly believe that we cannot 

achieve true excellence without 
leveraging the experiences and 
perspectives 
of 
the 
broadest 

possible diversity of students, 
faculty, and staff,” Schlissel said. 
“This is challenging work. Not 
only building a diverse student 
body, 
but 
also 
creating 
an 

inclusive campus climate that is 
open to difficult discourse.”

Despite 
delivering 
a 
clear 

promise to aggressively pursue 
an agenda of inclusion, Schlissel 

said the process of exploring 
the University he now leads in 
ongoing.

“I 
am 
walking 
in 
new 

directions, and I am asking a lot 
of questions,” Schlissel said. “I am 
meeting with students, staff, and 
faculty, learning their aspirations, 
what they are most proud of, and 
what they are anxious about as we 
move forward together.”

Pollack, 
the 
University’s 

provost, gave opening remarks 
welcoming the community and 
introducing 
the 
University’s 

governing Board of Regents, deans 
and faculty, as well as Schlissel 
and his extended family. She 
also stressed the responsibility 
Schlissel has to respond to the 
challenges and trials facing public 
higher education.

Following her speech, Snyder 

noted 
Schlissel’s 
eagerness 

to learn, alluding to the new 
president’s recent trip around 
the state. He added that Schlissel 
will serve as the cornerstone of 
humanity at the University.

“What makes the University 

of Michigan a truly special place 
is not one area or sectors, it is the 
humanity of the University, the 
people,” Snyder said.

In an address that elicited 

thunderous 
applause 
multiple 

times, Simmons, who served as 
the president of Brown University 
and 
appointed 
Schlissel 
it’s 

provost, called on universities 
to devote more attention to 
ensuring students leave prepared 
to resolve conflict and treat 
others with respect — even as 
they increasingly push forward 
new innovations in science and 
technology.

“Respect for others is a goal 

worth setting and worthy of 
presidential leadership,” she said.

Regent Kathy White, who 

is the chair of the Board of 
Regents, 
outlined 
a 
history 

of past University presidents, 
concluding 
with 
Schlissel’s 

formal inauguration. The crowd 
gave an overwhelming standing 
ovation.

An 
hour 
before 
the 

inauguration ceremony, Schlissel 
joined the regents, executive 
officers, 
deans, 
faculty 
and 

representatives from 100 other 
universities for a formal robing 
ceremony 
held 
in 
Rackham 

Auditorium.

In an interview with The 

Michigan 
Daily 
during 
the 

ceremony, Schlissel said he was 
impressed by the number of 
guests who came to represent 
their university, department or 
college.

“It is one of the most amazing 

days of my life,” he said. “I’m 
humbled.”

Though he technically assumed 

the presidency in July, Schlissel 
said the past week has been an 
experience apart from the rest of 
his time at the University.

“It really changed a lot when 

the students came back to town a 
few days ago,” he said. “I’ve been 
running into students all across 
the campus. The energy level 
went up a notch and it’s just really 
exciting.”

However, Schlissel said there’s 

more he can do to become further 
acquainted with the campus 
community.

“I have to continue my efforts 

to getting to know people, getting 
to know the faculty, students and 
staff and what their aspirations 

are and how I can add to the 
work of the University to make it 
better,” he said.

After the ceremonial robing 

process, 
a 
processional 
of 

hundreds of gowned academics 
and officials marched down the 
steps of Rackham Auditorium and 
through the Diag, ending at Hill 
Auditorium.

Students 
and 
members 
of 

the community who lined the 
pathway cheered and applauded. 
Some event attendees reached 
for members of the processional, 
including President Emerita Mary 
Sue Coleman, to snap a photo.

In the Diag, student volunteers 

in maize T-shirts created a tunnel 
for the processional to walk 
through. Students chanted, “It’s 
great to be a Michigan Wolverine” 

and sang Hail to the Victors.

When Schlissel exited the 

student 
volunteer 
tunnel, 

many students jumped at the 
opportunity to give him a high 
five and take a selfie.

Dozens of those participants 

also took positions in a post-
inaugural 
community 
festival 

set outside the auditorium. A 
few hundred people gathered for 
University-sponsored food and 
music set up around Ingalls Mall.

LSA sophomores Kasey Wright 

and Stephanie Saravolatz served 
as event volunteers earlier in 
the day and helped cheer on the 
processional as it passed through 
the Diag.

“I am a scholarship student 

here and this was something 
I could do to give back to the 

University (that) has given me so 
much,” Wright said.

“Students started joining even 

though they didn’t have t-shirts 
and I thought that was pretty cool 
and I think everyone enjoyed it a 
lot,” Saravolatz said.

LSA 
junior 
Joe 
Murray, 

another student volunteer, said 
he was impressed with Schlissel’s 
inaugural speech and his push for 
valuing all voices, despite conflict 
or disagreement.

“I would love to see him 

implement those ideas he talked 
about as far as making sure the 
University stays really open to 
people and that we seek people 
from Michigan and around the 
country and the world, making 
sure everyone who deserves to go 
here has the opportunity to.”

Mark Schlissel inaugurated as University’s 14th president 

Warde Manuel introduced 
as new ‘M’ athletic director 

By MAX BULTMAN 

Managing Sports Editor

In front of a crowd of media, 

coaches, 
donors 
and 
former 

athletes, 
University 
President 

Mark Schlissel introduced Warde 
Manuel as Michigan’s next Athletic 
Director on Friday in a press 
conference at the Michigan Union.

Manuel, who is currently the 

athletic director at Connecticut, 
will officially begin work at 
Michigan on March 14, taking over 
for interim Athletic Director Jim 
Hackett, who has held the position 
since Oct. 31, 2014. 

Manuel holds three degrees 

from the University — a bachelor’s 
degree in general studies with a 
focus in Psychology, a master’s 
degree in social work and an M.B.A. 
from the Ross School of Business 
— and played defensive line on 
the football team for legendary 
Michigan coach Bo Schembechler. 
He also worked in the Athletic 
Department 
in 
various 
roles 

between 1996 and 2005, ultimately 
serving 
as 
Associate 
Athletic 

Director under Bill Martin.

Given 
his 
ties 
with 
the 

University, Manuel said he made 
no effort to play coy when he was 
contacted about the job opening.

“I want to say it was maybe, 

officially, some time toward the 
beginning of December that (the 
Turnkey Search firm) reached 
out to see if I had interest in the 

position,” Manuel said at his press 
conference. “I laughed when they 
asked me that question, like, ‘Are 
you really asking me if I have 
interest in being the Michigan 
A.D.?’ And (the recruiter) said, 
‘Yeah, really, I just need to hear the 
answer.’

“And I said, ‘Hell yeah!’ ”
Manuel, who was among 82 

candidates Turnkey considered, 
inherits a self-sustaining athletic 
department with an operating 
budget of $151 million per year. 
Hackett, who was part of the 
search committee to fill his own 
seat, has made remarkable progress 
in his time, leaving the department 
in a state of stability.

Part of that stability came in the 

form of Michigan football coach 
Jim Harbaugh, whom Hackett 
hired. Harbaugh and Manuel 
were teammates for one year at 
Michigan, and Harbaugh was the 
captain of the team when Manuel 
was a freshman.

During the press conference, 

Manuel reminisced about sitting 
in the back of team meetings as a 
freshman, with Harbaugh in the 
front as a senior. He commented 
on how things had come full circle, 
with Harbaugh leading the football 
team as coach and Manuel heading 
up the athletic department.

Hearing that, Harbaugh stood 

up and gave Hackett a hug, slipping 
Manuel a No. 79 Michigan jersey 
with his name on it.

“I used to be able to fit in this,” 

Manuel quipped.

While he may not fit in the 

jersey, he should fit in well in his 
new position. Manuel is the most 
experienced 
athletic 
director 

Michigan has ever hired, and he 
has built up the foundations of 
relationships with some of the 
Wolverines’ 
most 
prominent 

coaches through visits during 
recent years.

Manuel has held his current 

post at UConn since 2012, and the 
Huskies have won six national 
titles with him in charge. In 2015, 
13 UConn teams turned in perfect 
single-year Academic Progress 
Rates. Prior to working with the 
Huskies, he served as Buffalo’s 
athletic director from 2005-12.

Now, he returns to Michigan 

hoping to continue his success 
both on and off the field.

“There should be excitement 

about the future and potential 
for Michigan to not only win Big 
Ten championships but national 
championships,” 
Manuel 
said. 

“We don’t back away from it. We 
never have, and we never will.” 

Manuel’s contract will pay him 

an annual base salary of $800,000 
with deferred compensation of 
$100,000 per year. He will be 
paid 
a 
one-time 
recruitment 

incentive of $250,000 as well as 
being provided two cars, moving 
expenses and standard university 
benefits.

Jim Harbaugh welcomed 
as next ‘M’ football coach

By MAX BULTMAN

GREG GARNO 

Daily Sports Editor and 

Daily Sports Writer 

Jim Harbaugh’s first press 

conference 
as 
Michigan 

football 
coach 
was 
filled 

with laughter and clapping 
from the players, coaches and 
family looking on.

But the room of hundreds 

went quiet when Harbaugh 
was asked if he was inheriting 
a turnaround program.

“This 
is 
Michigan,” 

Harbaugh said. “There are 
no turnarounds at Michigan. 
This is greatness.”

He added in his statement: 

“Throughout my life I have 
dreamed of coaching at the 
University of Michigan. Now I 
have the honor to live it.”

The 
Michigan 
Athletic 

Department announced the 
hiring of the former San 
Francisco 
49ers 
coach 
on 

Tuesday afternoon, the 20th 
coach in program history. 
Harbaugh agreed to a seven-
year contract paying a base 
salary of $5 million per year.

Hoarse-voiced 
from 
a 

gatorade bath in his NFL-
finale Sunday, he handled his 
first press conference nearly 
an 
hour 
after 
addressing 

his team for the first time. 
Harbaugh 
didn’t 
give 
a 

timeline for when he planned 
to name a coaching staff.

A former quarterback under 

Bo Schembechler, Harbaugh 
was 
an 
All-American 
and 

Heisman 
Trophy 
finalist, 

but he’s been part of the 
Wolverines’ program since he 
was nine years old. Harbaugh’s 
father, Jack, was the defensive 
backs coach at Michigan while 
Jim was growing up.

It 
was 
then, 
Harbaugh 

said, that he first dreamed of 
coaching at Michigan.

“When I was nine to 10 

years old, there was a time 
when I was sitting in coach 
Schembechler’s office. I was 
sitting in his chair; I had my 
feet up on his desk,” Harbaugh 
recalled. “He walked in and 
said, ‘How ya doin’, Jim?’ And 
I said, ‘I’m doing great Bo, how 
you doin’? He said, ‘Whattaya 
doin?’ and I said, ‘I’m sitting 
in 
your 
chair, 
coach!’ 
... 

There’s just been times in my 
life where I’ve thought about 
it, dreamed about it, and now 
it’s time to live it.”

In addition to his $5 million 

base 
salary, 
Harbaugh’s 

contract includes incentives 
for playing in ($125,000) or 
winning ($250,000) the Big 
Ten 
Championship 
Game, 

a $50,000 bonus if he is Big 
Ten Coach of the Year and a 
$150,000 bonus for each year 
the team’s Academic Progress 
Rate is 960 or higher. He can 
also earn $300,000 for playing 
the College Football Playoff 
or $500,000 for winning the 
national championship.

His contract includes a $2 

million signing bonus.

Michigan marks Harbaugh’s 

fourth head coaching job in the 
last 10 years, most recently in 
San Francisco, where his base 
salary is roughly the same as 
it will be with the Wolverines.

“I kind of think of myself 

as 
a 
construction 
guy,” 

Harbaugh said. “You build 
this home, and hopefully it’s 
a great cathedral, and then 
afterwards they tell you, ‘Go 
build another one.’ And I feel 
like that again. … But I’d really 
like to live in one permanently. 
And that’s what I’m really 
hopeful for here.”

Harbaugh 
insisted 
his 

decision to take the Michigan 
job had little to do with 
his 
salary 
or 
financial 

considerations.

“I really made a decision 

from 
the 
heart, 
which 
I 

thought was best for myself 
and my family,” Harbaugh 
said. “I’m very excited by it 
and very challenged by it.”

T

hough the anti-Islam words 
that appeared on the Diag 
earlier this week could be 

easily 
erased 

by 
a 
group 

of 
students 

with 
rags 

and 
buckets 

of water, the 
same 
cannot 

be said for the 
sentiments 
behind 
the 

statements, 
which 
are 

systemic 
and 

unfortunately 
long-lived.

We cannot dismiss those hostile 

messages with a shrug and an 
invocation of the importance of 
“free speech.” We cannot let the 
broader debate over “safe spaces” 
on college campuses obscure the 
fact that, whatever the motivation 
or intention, whoever wrote the 
messages gave a voice to hatred 
and hostility toward the religion 
of Islam and those who follow 
it. And we cannot deny that this 
Islamophobia dehumanizes and 
marginalizes millions of Muslims 
who are guilty of nothing more 
than being Muslims, laying the 
groundwork for persecution and 
violence toward them.

Unfortunately, this is precisely 

what 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 

comments 
on 
The 
Michigan 

Daily’s coverage of the anti-
Islam chalk do. They attempt to 
dilute the maliciousness behind 
the statements and attribute the 
outrage that the words sparked 
to yet another round of the debate 
surrounding 
“safe 
spaces” 
on 

university campuses. “Look what 
we have here,” they seem to say, 

“another episode of anguish for 
those goddamn, cry-baby liberal 
students, so coddled that they 
simply can’t handle discomfort, let 
alone honest disagreement.”

Forget paraphrasing. By way 

of 
example, 
here’s 
what 
one 

commenter actually wrote: “To 
the darling precious snowflakes 
who melt into a shimmering 
puddle 
when 
they 
see 
chalk 

drawings 
they 
don’t 
approve 

of — do you EVER hope to get a 
job?? You understand that ALL 
workplaces (even university labs) 
are filled with a variety of people 
some of whom may have different 
perspectives and even different 
values than you.” Four other 
commenters nodded in agreement 
with a “like.”

Though the chalk writings were 

expressing a “perspective” that’s 
(thankfully) “different” than that 
of many, that’s only the beginning 
of the discussion we need to be 
having. At a university where 
respect, 
civility 
and 
equality 

are supposed to be at the core, 
we cannot tolerate a “different 
perspective” that’s grounded in 
ignorance and hatred of people 
because of their religion. This 
is a “perspective” that exposes 
Muslims to the risk of physical 
harm and hurts them in other 
ways that are just as real and 
equally as offensive. 

It 
doesn’t 
matter 
whether 

the inflammatory words were 
written in chalk on the Diag or 
burned into the side of Angell Hall 
with a blowtorch. They must be 
understood as a virulent attack 
on our community’s obligation 
to be more inclusive. To dismiss 
the statements as harmless, let 
alone to defend them as protected 

by concepts of “free speech,” 
aids those who would divide the 
University 
community. 
These 

words cannot go unchallenged.

If, instead of the anti-Islam 

statements, 
there 
had 
been 

swastikas, I strongly doubt that 
so many of the comments on 
the Daily’s article would’ve told 
offended Jews to “cry me a river.” 
That’s 
because 
generally, 
we 

understand and reject anti-Semitic 
remarks as harmful hate speech 
that alienates an entire population. 
In most quarters, malicious Jewish 
conspiracy theories aren’t accepted 
as merely expressing a “different 
perspective,” and Jewish slurs 
aren’t excused as simply an exercise 
of “free speech.” In this regard, 
Islamophobia is no different than 
anti-Semitism.

To be sure, freedom of speech 

should 
be 
broadly 
defined, 

particularly 
in 
an 
academic 

setting, where open expression 
of different ideologies, thoughts, 
beliefs, 
analyses, 
viewpoints 

— you name it — is essential to 
generating meaningful discussion 
of important but difficult issues. 
But the motivation behind the 
speech matters, and to pretend 
that the words on the Diag were 
inspired by anything other than 
hatred and bigotry is absurd. That 
doesn’t mean that those words 
can’t be uttered or written, even 
in the way they were. It just means 
that the statements, and whoever 
wrote them, deserve nothing more 
than to be swiftly condemned by 
both the administration and our 
community as a whole. It’s that 
simple.

I

t’s almost impossible not to think 
of Steubenville, Ohio when hear-
ing about the recent case in 

Maryville, 
Mis-

souri. For those 
who 
haven’t 

yet heard of the 
Maryville case — 
or the Steubenville 
case, for that mat-
ter — both involve 
the alleged rape 
of an intoxicated 
teenaged girl by 
hot-shot 
football 

players, and both 
involve the community rising to the 
defense of the alleged rapists.

The Maryville story is a long, 

horrifying ordeal that’s been, for the 
most part, buried from the eyes of the 
public until recently. To summarize: 
In 
January 
2012, 
14-year-old 

cheerleader Daisy Coleman sneaked 
out with a friend to meet up with 
17-year-old football player Matthew 
Barnett. She was encouraged to drink 
excessively out of the “bitch cup,” 
and was allegedly raped by Barnett 
while his buddy filmed it with an 
iPhone. Her friend, Paige Parkhurst, 
just 13 at the time — under the age of 
consent in Missouri, by the way — was 
also allegedly sexually assaulted by 
another football player. After all of 
this, Coleman was left on a front lawn 
in below freezing weather for her 
mother to find in the morning. This 
was more than a year ago, and most 
people are just hearing about it now. 
I encourage you to read more on it if 
you’re interested in educating yourself 
further and ruining your day.

But today, those football buddies are 

off at college, free from all charges of 
sexual assault — or anything, for that 
matter. Even with all of the evidence 
against the alleged rapists — even 
after Sheriff Darren White reportedly 
stated that this would “absolutely” 
result in a conviction — the boys still 
were able to walk free. Sheriff White’s 
advice to the Colemans? “I guess 
they’re just going to have to get over 
it.”

Rape cases are already hugely 

underreported, so when something 
as heinous as the Maryville case gets 
utterly brushed to the side, what kind 
of message does that send?

It sends a message that says 

Maryville supports its football players, 
supports masculinity and “boys will 
be boys” — but ladies who get mixed 
up with these boys are “skanks” and 
“crazy bitches.” In short, Maryville 
supports rape culture.

So who were the victims of the 

Maryville incident? Well, there were 
of course the boys, whose reputations 
and football careers were at stake. A 
parent of one of the teens at Barnett’s 

house is actually reported as saying, 
“Our boys deserve an apology, and 
they haven’t gotten it yet.” There were 
the poor coworkers at Mrs. Coleman’s 
old workplace, who had to deal with 
her “stress.” There was even Barnett’s 
daddy, a GOP politician in Missouri 
who decided to stay out of the case 
because it “would have been bad for 
me.” As far as the girls who were 
allegedly raped? “F--- yea. That’s what 
you get for bein a skank : ),” reads one 
tweet in response to the dismissed 
charges.

Victim-blaming is nothing new; 

we’ve heard it all before. She drank too 
much; she was asking for it; she should 
have known better; she shouldn’t 
have worn that outfit; she shouldn’t 
have been hanging around boys that 
age; she was out too late at night; why 
didn’t she take a cab? Why did she 
take a cab? She should have called the 
police sooner — it goes on and on and 
on.

There’s the flip side of victim-

blaming, and that’s rape apology, but 
I’m thinking even more specifically 
of a bizarre form of rape sympathy 
that I’ve been noticing. The focus, in 
the case of rape sympathy, is taken 
off the victim, and placed on the 
repercussions that the rapist will or 
would have to potentially face.

I’m thinking of those photographs 

in The New York Times — of those 
poor Steubenville boys who could 
have had it all, dressed in neat button-
downs, rendered weeping into their 
palms in the courtroom because 
of some stupid girl who ruined 
everything for them. I’m thinking 
of CNN anchor Candy Crowley’s 
response to the Steubenville rapists’ 
sentencing — “I cannot imagine how 
emotional the sentencing must have 
been.” I’m thinking of endless hateful 
tweets aimed at “sluts” and “skanks” 
of all ages all over the world. I’m 
thinking of the incident in Torrington, 
Connecticut — another rape case 
involving football players.

This case involved two 18-year-old 

football players, Edgar Gonzalez and 
Joan Toribio, who were convicted 
of rape after they had sex with two 
13-year-old girls, with the age of 
consent in Connecticut being 16. 
What happened next was a slew of 
online harassment targeted toward, 
of course, these girls — these girls who 
were still in middle school. “What was 
a 13 year old girl doing hanging around 
with 18 year old guys…” one girl posted 
on Twitter. I’d ask the question in 
response, what were 18-year-old boys 
doing have sex with girls who weren’t 
even out of middle school? “You 
destroyed two people’s lives” another 
tweet reads, referring, of course, to 
the boys’ lives. This is past the point of 
rape apology — it’s sympathy.

One 
of 
the 
football 
players, 

Gonzalez, won the title of MVP for his 
team, and in response to the charges, 
Torrington High School’s Athletic 
Director Mike McKenna stated, “If 
you think there’s some wild band of 
athletes that are wandering around 
then I think you’re mistaken … These 
things happen everywhere and we’re 
not any different than any other 
community.” And he’s right.

I think it’s worth stopping and 

considering how this all-American, 
sports-centric model that exists in so 
many high schools — and colleges — 
affects how people view masculinity 
and sexual assault. I’m not saying 
football is to blame for rape, just like 
too many shots at a party, a short skirt, 
not having a boyfriend, letting him 
pay for you at the bar … is not to blame 
for rape. Rapists are to blame for rape. 
It’s been said so many times and yet it 
still hasn’t quite seem to have gotten 
through to everyone.

So 
what 
happens 
when 
the 

University has its very own sexual 
assault scandal involving a football 
player? We sweep it under the rug, 
pretend it never happened and 
head to the game to lose our voices 
cheering on our beloved Wolverines. 
In 2009, current University senior and 
placekicker on the University football 
team Brendan Gibbons was arrested 
for allegedly raping an 18-year-
old woman at a fraternity party. 
Washtenaw Watchdogs has a detailed 
synopsis of the allegations, and Daily 
blogger Emma Maniere wrote about 
Gibbons fairly recently, but for the 
most part, it’s been willfully ignored 
by the University. Many University 
students and Wolverine fans still 
don’t know about the allegations, 
and even after they do find out about 
them — well, the thought of there 
being a potential rapist on the field 
while we sing the fight song is kind of 
uncomfortable, so we dismiss those 
thoughts.

In the Gibbons police reports, it’s 

written, “(Gibbons) stated his whole 
life will probably get ruined, and that 
the girl always wins.” Let’s make 
one thing clear: The girl does not 
always win. According to RAINN, as 
many as 97 percent of rapists are not 
charged. The girl very rarely “wins.” 
And anyway, sex should not have a 
“winner.” A woman you want to take 
to bed is not your opponent. Sex is 
not just another sport — another way 
to reaffirm your masculinity and 
machismo.

Rape culture is real, and it’s impor-

tant to be mindful of how we’re par-
ticipating, even if it’s just as spectators.

Rape culture is real

An attack on inclusivity

FROM THE DAILY

Too little too late

Saturday afternoon, sophomore quarterback Shane Morris took a helmet-to-

helmet hit during the fourth quarter of the Michigan football team’s game 

against Minnesota. Morris remained in the game after exhibiting concussion-

like symptoms, obvious even to the untrained eye. After further assessment of 

an ankle injury sustained earlier in the game by the head athletic trainer, Morris 

was cleared and allowed into the game in blatant disregard for concussion 

protocol and player safety. In the days that followed, Michigan coach Brady 

Hoke, Athletic Director David Brandon and University President Mark Schlissel 

respectively released official statements about Saturday’s mishap. However, the 

lack of a timely and forceful response from the University Athletic Department, 

the University’s Board of Regents and Schlissel and the rising discontent among 

students and alumni propelled the story toward a national discussion about 

Michigan athletics and the way it treats its students on and off the field. Moving 

forward, the University and the Athletic Department must be transparent in 

their actions and make students their first priority.

9/30/14

10/18/13

The Athletic Department’s handling of the 

situation after the game and its response, or lack 
thereof, was a total failure. Hoke’s postgame 
press conference indicated his total ignorance 
regarding the incident, and his official statement, 
released Sunday afternoon, didn’t address 
Morris’ head injury. By Sunday night, the failure 
of the Athletic Department to address the 
situation and admit shortcomings allowed the 
story to hit all the major news outlets, even taking 
a segment on ABC’s “World News” and “Good 
Morning America.”

In his weekly Monday press conference, 

Hoke remained blatantly unprepared, did not 
know key information and repeatedly answered 
questions by asking reporters to refer to a 
forthcoming statement from the medical staff. 
At 12:52 a.m. Tuesday morning, that statement 
did not come from the medical staff, rather it 
came from Brandon, who addressed the situation 
on behalf of the Athletic Department. The 
statement contradicted many of Hoke’s half-
answers during his earlier press conference. 
Most notably, Brandon confirmed Morris had 
suffered a “probable, mild concussion,” when 
previously Hoke stated there had been no signs 
of head trauma.

According to Brandon, the oversight occurred 

because medical personnel and the coaching 
staff did not see the hit. A general failure of 
communication further prevented the proper 
and timely handling of Morris’ head injury. 
Though this statement and statements from 
Hoke don’t suggest intentionality, there is no 
acceptable excuse for compromising player 
safety, as negligence is equally as deplorable. The 
players on the field are entwined in a culture of 
toughness and playing through injury without 
much regard to the potential hazards of doing so. 
The decision to play cannot be left to the students.

ESPN 
Broadcaster 
Ed 
Cunningham 

lambasted the team for its lack of concern for 
Morris’ safety for multiple minutes on air during 
the game, both before the hit to the head while 
Morris was limping around with an ankle injury 
and after the hit. The crowd booed loudly when 
Morris was left in and subsequently when he 
reentered the game. Because the hit on Morris 
occurred after the ball left his hands, the coaches 

were no longer watching the quarterback when 
the incident happened, and therefore, sideline 
staff assumed his post-hit stumbling was due 
to his ankle injury. The lack of communication 
between coaching staff, athletic trainers and 
the team neurologist prevented Morris from 
receiving a full examination and allowed for his 
reinsertion into the game. Brandon’s statement 
early Tuesday morning outlines a plan to have 
a medical professional in the press box or video 
booth to ensure that this situation will not 
happen again due to a failure to see the entirety 
of the play, and also says the team is examining its 
sideline communications with regard to player 
injuries. These proposed changes, supported 
by Schlissel in his statement, and by the NCAA, 
must be implemented immediately.

This incident was just the tipping point 

for public opinion of the University Athletic 
Department. Students feel a large disconnect 
with the Athletic Department, especially in 
light of the failed implementation of a general 
admission seating policy at football games and 
the switch to a claims-based system for basketball 
tickets. Furthermore, students and non-students 
alike are fed up with historically high ticket 
prices, especially for a season with one of the 
weakest home schedules in recent memory and 
an increasingly over commercialized stadium 
culture. Many fans feel loyalty is no longer 
rewarded, as exemplified earlier in the week 
with the two Coke products for two tickets 
marketing ploy. In addition, the mishandling 
of former kicker Brendan Gibbons’ permanent 
separation from the University after being found 
responsible for violating the school’s sexual 
misconduct policy contributed to the simmering 
discontent of many students.

Overall, the Athletic Department’s public 

relations has failed to positively engage students, 
alumni and fans, leading to Tuesday’s protest 
and petition through the CSG website calling 
for Dave Brandon’s resignation that has amassed 
over 10,000 signatures. In order to rectify the 
situation, the University administration and 
the Athletic Department must restructure their 
priorities to include the safety and well-being of 
student athletes while also keeping the input of 
all students in mind.

Editor’s Note: As commencement is upon 

us, Michigan in Color thought it would be 
important for the larger University community 
to reflect on the initiatives we experienced as 
students. This piece was a phenomenal critique 
of the current plans for Diversity, Equity, and 
Inclusion. This piece reflects the necessity of 
continuing conversations that impact beyond 
the brief time we spent on campus. The plans 
for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion are meant 
to impact the students who are on campus 
now, but they are also supposed to impact 
generations of Wolverines to come. Michigan in 
Color encourages everyone, whether moving on, 
continuing, or just beginning your time here, to 
remember that we should work to create changes 
that outlive our moments here at the University. 
We are a part of a legacy. Why should our social 
impact be any different?

While University President Mark Schlissel’s 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion strategic planning 
initiative is admirable, its prospects for success 
are questionable. The President’s charge calls on 
each campus unit to develop a five-year strategic 
plan to promote Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. 
We are excited to see this new momentum in the 
wake of the #BBUM campaign, and to see this 
effort come from top University leadership. The 
current dialogue is absolutely necessary for us 
to continue to foster awareness of historical and 
ongoing institutional biases at the University, and 
to move beyond a purely academic understanding 
of structural racism. Unfortunately, the initiative 
falls short in a profoundly important way.

To date, there has been no explicit allocation 

of resources to make diversity happen at the 

University. 
Other 
educational 
institutions 

have recently funded large-scale diversity 
programs: Brown University announced plans 
to spend $100 million to promote diversity on 
its campus, and Yale University launched a $50 
million initiative to increase faculty diversity. 
These financial pledges are a testament to their 
commitment to social equity. We are waiting 
to see whether efforts at the University will be 
supported by funds commensurate with their 
degree of importance.

Funding for the President’s charge remains 

ambiguous, even as two mechanisms for 
diversity funding opportunities have been 
described in disseminated documents. First, 
departments are encouraged to submit “requests 
for funding for innovative initiatives … through 
the annual budget process,” according to a 
frequently asked questions document distributed 
to campus groups in November. However, there 
is little transparency surrounding how much 
will be made available within the annual budget, 
or how competitive it will be to secure these 
funds. Secondly, the campus-wide initiative is 
being overseen by an executive leadership team 
that “will allocate resources throughout the 
planning process and ensure that the effort is 
appropriately supported and staffed.” Again, the 
level of support and direct provision of tangible 
funds remains vague. In order to address climate 
and bias issues effectively, allocated budgetary 
line items are needed to develop, implement and 
sustain strategic plans.

EVENT PREVIEW
Pussy Riot Gives 
‘Punk Prayer’

Russian protest group 

to participate in 
lecture series

By GILLIAN JAKAB

Daily Arts Writer

Patriarch Gundyay believes in 

Putin / Would be better, the bastard, 
if he believed in God! / The Virgin’s 
belt won’t replace 
political gather-
ings / The eter-
nal Virgin Mary 
is with us in our 
protests!

These 
are 

some of the lyr-
ics from Pussy 
Riot’s 
“Punk 

Prayer,” 
per-

formed by five 
masked 
faces 

in Cathedral of 
Christ the Sav-
ior in Moscow in 
March 2012. They criticize, among 
other things, the lack of separation 
between the Russian Orthodox 
Church and Putin’s increasingly 
totalitarian 
government. 
The 

Pussy Riot members brought their 
message of rights for Russia’s 
marginalized — women, LGBTQ, 
youth — up from Moscow’s under-
ground scene and into view of the 
world. But they did so at a price.

Nadezhda (Nadya) Tolokon-

nikova and Maria (Masha) Alyokh-
ina, two of Pussy Riot’s members, 
were among those arrested for the 
performance and were sentenced 
to two years of prison on charges 
of “hooliganism” and disrupting 
public order with a religious hate 
crime. Amnesty International and 
many other human rights organi-
zations decried the prosecution 
as suppression of free speech 
and politically motivated. The 
women’s trial and imprisonment 
under harsh conditions gained 
international attention and an 
outpouring of sympathy from art-
ists around the world.

Vigilance and pressure from 

the international community may 
have contributed to the Pussy 
Riot members’ early release in 
December 2013, though some 
said it was because the expira-
tion of their terms would have 
coincided with the Winter Olym-
pics in Russia. Having endured 
the horrors of Russia’s prisons 
and legal system, Masha and 
Nadya have founded Zona Prava 
(Justice Zone), a prisoner’s rights 
NGO that offers advocacy and 
aid to prisoners, and MediaZona, 
a media forum that reports on 

issues of prisons and legal sys-
tems worldwide.

The 
rockers-turned-revolu-

tionaries are publicizing their 
experiences and aims in a world 
tour that includes a stop in Ann 
Arbor. This Thursday evening in 
the Michigan Theater, University 
organizations The Penny Stamps 
Distinguished Speaker Series and 
the Weiser Center for Emerging 
Democracies are co-presenting 
the Pussy Riot/Zona Prava mem-
bers’ lecture “Punk Prayer.”

In curating the Stamps series, 

Chrisstina Hamilton — direc-
tor of visitor’s programs at the 
Penny Stamps School of Art and 
Design — tries to choose speakers 
that reflect the issues of concerns 
and interest on campus and in the 
classroom. The lineup is created 
via nominations from throughout 
the University, but the particular 
invitation to Pussy Riot and Zona 
Prava members Nadezhda Tolo-
konnikova and Maria Alyokhina, 
was a whim of Hamilton’s own.

Hamilton was in New York 

this past spring when the two 
Pussy Riot members gave a pub-
lic interview on Randall’s Island 
organized by London’s Frieze 
Festival. The interview was con-
ducted in a room that allowed 
only 100 seats and left many dis-
gruntled feminist punk enthusi-
asts on the outs.

“When I was there, I said to 

the organizers: please put me in 
touch with them because I actu-
ally have a 1,700 seat theater,” 
Hamilton said. “Obviously they 
want to speak to people about 
what they’re doing; I can give 
them a much more public voice 
and venue in order to do that.”

The Michigan Theater is an 

icon in a city steeped in the his-
tory of political activism and 
influential artist communities. 
Though the scale and methods 
of protest at the University have 
shifted since the 1960s, students 
today grapple with issues of iden-
tity through publications such as 
The Michigan Daily’s “Michigan 
in Color” series and “What the 
F,” and voice their passions for 
social, economic and political 
justice locally and globally. Pussy 
Riot’s words, their credibility 
rooted in deeds, will find a warm 
reception here.

“Russia’s in the news con-

stantly right now,” Hamilton 
said. “The fact that these young 
women were able to stand up to 
Putin, be in prison, and … have 
garnered this international atten-
tion, gives them a lot of power.”

Masha and Nadya are harness-

ing this power to shed light on 

the oppression of feminist and 
LGBTQ* communities in Russia, 
the consequences of dissent, and 
the brutal Russian penal system.

“A lot of the people who are 

going to come obviously know 
something of the story of what’s 
happened to them up to this 
point, but I think it will be very 
excited to hear about what their 
plans are now that they’ve cap-
tured the world stage, what are 
they going to do with it?”

Though they are rock stars on 

the metaphorical stage of world 
politics and media, they will not 
be performing in the musical 
sense on the stage of the Michi-
gan Theater. Right before coming 
to Ann Arbor, Pussy Riot joined 
many punk bands at Riot Fest 
Chicago, not on the lineup to play 
a concert, but to give a panel dis-
cussion.

“They won’t actually be per-

forming,” Hamilton said. “I asked 
them about it when we were dis-
cussing the whole thing and their 
response was: they don’t perform 
… they’re activists. They would 
perform if there were a reason to, 
as they have done.”

“I’m looking at it more as 

the context of the moment that 
they’re performing in, which in 
some ways makes it more punk 
rock than any punk rock,” she 
added.

In the field of performance 

studies, some scholars would 
disagree with this distinction 
and tend to define performance 
as a public practice, analyzing 
“performances” 
spanning 
the 

spectrum from religious rituals 
to Shakespeare on a proscenium 
stage. Though Pussy Riot did not 
achieve its fame by merit of its 
music and performance art, the 
group’s genre of conceptual art 
amplifies and articulates its polit-
ical message.

In their interview on the Col-

bert Report, Nadya and Masha 
say they’ve come to America to 
“look at American prisons, to talk 
to human rights activists, and 
to learn from their experience.” 
They explain that it presents a 
middle ground between the inhu-
mane prison system in Russia and 
the mostly pleasant conditions 
of the prisons they visited in the 
Netherlands. On campus, Nadya 
and Masha will get to learn more 
about the American prison sys-
tem when they meet with Lisa 
Greco, the Prison Creative Arts 
(PCAP) events coordinator and 
Washtenaw County Youth Center 
Director, as well as Carol Mor-
ris, a local artist who works with 
women in prison and youth in 
detention and treatment. They 
will tour the facility and discuss 
the work of Youth Arts Alliance! 
and PCAP.

“Performing” or not, the only 

way to experience the power of 
Pussy Riot is live, and this Thurs-
day’s Penny Stamps lecture is one 
of a select few opportunities in 
the U.S. to do so.

Adele’s ‘25’ touches 
on her broken 20’s

By AMELIA ZAK

Daily Arts Writer

Ms. Adele Adkins, four years 

ago, would describe herself 
as a highly depressed, less 
mature, very bitter voracious 
smoker who 
paired each 
passing 
day 
with 

a bottle of 
wine. 
She 

was the life 
of the party 
who 
said 

too 
much 

and cared too little. Her 2011 
project, the album 21, reflected 
this situational distress. She 
was living and learning and 
feeling; and with all that, she 
produced what will probably be 
perpetually recognized as her 
best, most important work. 21 
reflects just what Springsteen’s 
Tunnel of Love, Dylan’s Blood 
on the Tracks, The Strokes’ Is 
This It, or Fleetwood Mac’s 
Rumours did: The indisputable 
condition of the creative soul 
is that when they are the most 
sad, or the most emotionally 
distraught, their best work is 
set to inevitably emerge. Being 
in despair almost always means 
you’re the most artistically 
motivated. 
It’s 
in 
those 

moments of intense emotional 
disparity that artists are most 
motivated to find the answer 
to the question that belies the 
human experience: “What is the 
point to all this ‘love’ bullshit?”

Adele reconnects with this 

unanswerable query, and many 
more, 
on 
her 
just-released 

album, 25. She’s a mother 
now and has happily settled 
into 
a 
stable 
relationship 

with the father of her child. 
Adele doesn’t smoke anymore, 
doesn’t drink, spends time with 
close friends but, admittedly, 
spends most nights at home 
with her family. After all the 
emotional and lifestyle changes 
over the past four years, it’s a 
little surprising that all these 
acquired experiences wouldn’t 
immediately 
inspire 
and 

motivate an album for age 23, 
or at the very least for the age 
of 24.

But writer’s block plagued 

the mind of one of the world’s 
favorite red-heads. She held 
her experiences in equally high 
esteem, surely, but struggled to 
connect them to her art form. 
Writing sessions with an array 
of acclaimed individuals — 
Ryan Tedder, Danger Mouse, 
Greg Kurstin, Shellback and 
many others — were supposed 
to help spur her creativity. And 
a lot of that didn’t help. More 
time was supposed to help, too. 
More learning, more yearning 
and personal reflection: this 
combination should open the 
floodgates to Adele’s hidden 

world of pain, shouldn’t it? 
The 
Almighty 
Adele 
had 

to 
eventually 
reemerge 
in 

the studio with some new 
recollection of a messed up life 
and mind. That’s what we have 
all pegged her to do, isn’t it?

Ms. Adkins, instead, decided 

to give herself the necessary 
amount of time, whatever that 
would be, before releasing 25. 
She waited for what was most 
honest, a key ingredient to all 
of Adele’s music. This task — 
locating the most honest parts 
of yourself, or the messages 
that most clearly define your 
current emotional and mental 
landscape — is exceptionally 
arduous. 
And 
when 
one 

considers how many people 
plan to draw relatability and 
direction from whatever is 
produced, the difficulty of the 
task intensifies.

So, as the emotional epi-pen 

to millions, what do you do? 
Do you give the perpetually 
despaired masses what they 
crave: 
soulful, 
gorgeously 

produced 
pop 
music 
to 

underlie 
a 
nearly 
perfect 

voice speaking sonnets of lost 
loves, bad decisions and unfair 
conditions? 
Adele 
had 
the 

formula for what would derive 
for her the most success — she 
had acquired it with 21. But 
she left it back there, with her 
frightfully distraught 21-year-
old self and reemerged in the 
studio with the wisdom of a 
new mother, the depth of a lover 
in some comfortable, settled 
kind of love, and the child-like, 
experimental nature of one still 
trying to define their 20s.

The lens from which Adele 

envisioned 25 was less jaded and 
broken, but far more mature. 
In 25, Adele lyrically chastises 
herself, 
rather 
than 
some 

unnamed man of the past, for 
her mistakes and shortcomings 
and the people she has hurt. 
The album’s opener and first 
single, “Hello,” is a direct 
indicator of this sentiment: I 
royally screwed up a couple of 
years ago, and so did you. Let’s 
reconnect.

Other tracks, like “River 

Lea” or “Million Years Ago” 
drip with self-deprecation and 
nostalgia. “I know I’m not the 
only one who regrets the things 
they’ve done,” sings Adele on 
“Million Years Ago.” She is 
missing her youth, missing her 
former self and reexamining 
it all from the aged wisdom of 
a woman who has trenched 
through some thick emotional 
shit. Other tracks like “Send My 
Love (To Your New Lover)” and 
“All I Ask” follow the lyrical 
themes found on 21. “If this is 
my last night with you, hold me 
like I’m more than just a friend 
/ give me a memory I can use,” 
sings Adele on the piano power 
ballad, “All I Ask.” It’s a song 

she co-wrote with one of her 
favorite 
musical 
colleagues, 

Bruno Mars. The pleading and 
nervous expectation of future 
sadness leans back into 21 for 
just a moment. Because, as Ms. 
Adkins reveals, time passes and 
hearts mend, but the fear of 
future loss remains.

“When We Were Young,” 

the fourth track on the album, 
was 
co-written 
by 
Tobias 

Jesso, Jr., the Piano Man for 
the new generation. Beginning 
as a slower piano ballad, the 
simplistic musicality of the 
song holds up against the 
consuming 
nature 
of 
both 

the song’s nostalgia and the 
singer’s emotion. Adele’s fluid 
syncopations 
with 
fellow 

artists is obvious on 25, but this 
artistic eye for collaboration is 
most successful on this fourth 
track. 

The 
most 
precious 
and 

possibly most mature track on 
25 opens with the giggles of 
her son. “Sweetest Devotion” 
begins with the little laughs 
and mumbles of a child before 
exploding 
into 
the 
layered 

explosions of the song. In the 
album’s finale, Adele makes 
it clear that she has self-
actualized as a mother and 
girlfriend. “Sweetest Devotion” 
is a postcard to her past and 
future self, letting them both 
know that at one point, and in 
one moment, she did figure it 
all out. 

The musicality of 25 is less 

cacophonous 
than 
21. 
The 

growth of Adele’s mind and 
heart has bled into her music 
as one of greater fluidity and 
smooth soul sounds. 25 does, 
however, hold variety: working 
with Max Martin, Shellback, 
Bruno Mars, and Danger Mouse 
left the album with a few more 
pop beats and a couple more 
catchy hooks. Listeners have 
lost 
the 
tantalizing 
drums 

of “Rolling in the Deep” and 
“Set Fire to the Rain,” but 
have gained the pop beats and 
sweeter versions of Ms. Adkins’ 
voice on “Water Under the 
Bridge” and “Send My Love (To 
Your New Lover).”

25 is a rightful follow-up 

to 
the 
Billboard-shattering 

success that was 21. The tear 
ducts of the listener are less 
empty and emotional staminas 
will feel less ravaged upon 
each listen, but Adele hasn’t 
rescinded her honesty. We have 
observed her potential. Adele 
has taken us to the peak of the 
mountain of despair. We’re back 
with her now, in the year 2015, 
piecing together what we have 
learned. Take another four or 
five years now, Adele, and send 
us a soul-pop postcard when 
you get to the next mountain.

RLINGTON, Texas — One 
night, and one more time

Thanks for the memories

Maybe 

the Fall Out 
Boy hit was 
just a part of 
the Kansas 
pep band’s 
routine 
playlist, but maybe — with the 
Jayhawks leading 63-52 during 
a timeout at the 9:59 mark of the 
second half — it was an early 
tip of the cap, an ode to the end 
of the 2012-13 Michigan men’s 
basketball team. And why not? 
Kansas was dominating all 
facets of the game and well on its 
way to the Elite Eight.

So thanks for the memories, 

cheerleader Alexandria DeLuca. 
You’re a senior, so it appeared to 
be your final game cheerleading 
for Michigan, and you knew the 
tears were on their way.

Thank you, LSA junior Zachary 

Salander. As a mellophone player 
in Michigan’s pep band, we’ve 
heard you during each and every 
home game, though we wouldn’t 
recognize you if we passed you on 
the street.

And thank you, Josh 

Bartelstein and Matt Vogrich. 
The pair of senior guards battled 
day in and day out in practice and 
provided invaluable leadership 
but played sparingly this season. 
Both of your basketball careers 
looked to be over, and in nine 
minutes and 59 seconds, your real-
world lives were set to begin.

But most importantly, thank 

you, Trey Burke. You were the 
catalyst behind an improbable Big 
Ten Championship last season, 
and as college basketball’s best 
player this year, you put the 
Michigan basketball program 
back into a spotlight that hasn’t 
shined on Ann Arbor since the 
Fab Five days.

But as the song goes:
One night, and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren’t so 

great

For much of Friday night, as 

the Wolverines couldn’t keep up 
with the Jayhawks, it was time 
to reflect on the memories of a 
season full of ups and downs, 
and of course, Burke’s illustrious 
two-year career. Before he bolts 
to the NBA, he was supposed to 
lead the Wolverines deeper than 
just the Sweet Sixteen, but by the 
9:59 mark, Burke was shooting 
just 4-for-12, good for just eight 
points after being held scoreless 
in the first half. His time in 
a maize-and-blue jersey was 
fleeting as each second ticked 
away on the massive Cowboy 
Stadium jumbotron.

Kansas continued to pour it on, 

eventually stretching its lead to 14 
with 6:50 to play. Meanwhile, not 
even lottery-pick money could buy 
Burke a shot in the game’s first 38 
minutes. The sophomore missed 
12 shots on Friday.

But then something changed. 

Staring down an eight-point 
deficit with 1:22 left to play 
and stuck on 10 points, Burke 
channeled his inner Jordan — 
yeah, that Jordan.

“I grew up watching Michael 

Jordan,” Burke said in the locker 
room nearly an hour later. “I’ve 
seen him make so many shots, 
and I’m not comparing myself to 
him, but — ”

He paused to collect himself, 

before referencing his favorite 
MJ quote.

I’ve missed more than 9,000 

shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 
300 games. Twenty-six times, I’ve 
been trusted to take the winning 
shot and missed. I’ve failed over 
and over and over again in my life. 
And that is why I succeed.

“I think that described me 

tonight,” Burke said calmly.

At the 1:15 mark, he nailed a 

3-pointer: five-point game.

With 14 seconds left, a layup: 

three-point game.

And with six ticks left, after 

Elijah Johnson missed the front 
end of a one-and-one, Burke 
pulled up from around seven feet 
behind the 3-point line: tie game.

“The moment it left my hand, I 

knew it was good,” Burke said.

So from Bartelstein, who was so 

confident that Burke’s shot would 
go in that he jumped out of his seat 
while the ball was at the peak of its 
arc, thank you, Trey Burke.

“That’s not how it was 

supposed to end. I’m not even sure 
what happened,” Bartelstein said.

His phone was ringing, and 

Zack Novak was on the other 
line. It was past 3 a.m. in Zwolle, 
Netherlands, where Novak had 
stayed up to watch the game, but 
Bartelstein didn’t take the call, 
joking that he wouldn’t be sleeping 
much on Thursday night, either.

“I don’t recommend normal 

people taking that shot,” he 
continued. “It was an iconic shot 
from an iconic player.”

And thank you, too, from 

Vogrich, the veteran whose 
minutes have decreased in each 
of the past three seasons.

“I just want to sit here 

forever,” he said aloud, but to 
no one in particular, from his 
seat in the locker room. A few 
minutes later, as he was still 
reveling in the moment, his dad 
texted him an underwhelming 
message that called Burke 
and teammate Mitch McGary 
“good.”

“We’ve got the best player in 

the country on our team,” Vogrich 
said. “I never thought it was over. 
But that’s the greatest game I’ve 
ever seen. Unbelievable. That was 
nuts, man.”

And Trey, Salander would like 

to thank you, too, for giving him 
the “perfect angle” to the end of 
the “craziest game I’ve ever been 
a part of.”

“I was right under the basket, 

and he shot it and I was like, ‘It’s 
going, it’s going, this is going in, 
this shot is going in the bucket!’ 
And then it went in,” Salander 
said. “It was just absolutely 
insane.

“I jumped and screamed and 

like, I — I just went crazy.”

Salander and the rest of his 

bandmates had to regain their 
composure to play ‘The Victors’ 
just seconds after the shot, when 
Kansas took a timeout, and then 
for the ensuing overtime session. 
After a brief celebration when 
the overtime clock read zero, and 
Michigan had escaped with an 
87-85 win, he calmly walked off 
the floor.

But the moment he stepped 

into the tunnel, hidden from the 
public’s view, he jumped and let 
out a feverish scream.

“Oh my gosh, it was just total 

excitement,” he said. “It was 
hard to contain myself.”

And then there was DeLuca. 

The tears that, as Michigan 
trailed throughout the game, she 
expected still did stream down 
her face.

“There were actually two 

moments that I cried,” she said, 
noting both the immediate 
aftermath of Burke’s game-tying 
3-pointer and Kansas’ buzzer-
beating miss in overtime.

“It was overwhelming,” 

DeLuca said. “You don’t want 
it to be over, so I was really just 
hoping that we could pull it off, 
that it just wasn’t over yet.”

It wasn’t over on Friday night, 

and come Saturday morning, when 
Bartelstein, Vogrich, Salander and 
DeLuca could’ve been boarding 
planes back to Michigan, they’ll 
instead still be in Dallas.

So the journeys of these 

four, out-of-the spotlight 
upperclassmen will continue 
until at least Sunday afternoon, 
where for at least one night, 
and one more time, we’ll say to 
you, Trey Burke, thanks for the 
memories.

For Michigan, a mesmerizing death
I

f it was a death, it was a 
mesmerizing death. It 
was an end fitting for a 

game that 
somehow 
made 
everyone 
believe again.

Brady 

Hoke went for it. He didn’t have 
to, and he even had a chance 
to change his mind. Michigan 
lined up for a two-point 
conversion to win the game. 
Ohio State coach Urban Meyer 
called a timeout. Hoke polled 
his seniors in the huddle. They 
all said to go for it.

It was a mesmerizing, 

brilliant death, but that 
doesn’t ease the pain, not for 
Devin Gardner, who was so 
despondent after the 42-41 loss 
to Ohio State, with his helmet 
pulled low over his face, that 
he needed Kevin Koger to 
escort him as he meandered in 
a daze off the field, and then 
sobbed so loudly it echoed down 
Michigan’s tunnel. His pain was 
raw and endearing and real.

It didn’t ease the pain 

for Hoke, whose eyes were 
as red as the thousands of 
Buckeye fans in the Big House. 
They had come expecting a 
rout, snatching tickets from 
Michigan fans who had long ago 
abandoned hope.

It didn’t ease the pain for 

Taylor Lewan, the fifth-year 
senior offensive tackle, who 
nearly choked up during his 

press conference.

“I love every single one of these 

guys,” said Lewan, whose last 
play at Michigan Stadium was 
the most wrenching. His voiced 
wavered. He turned to Jake Ryan 
and tapped Ryan’s arm with his 
fist. “He’s my best friend.”

Hoke went for it, because “we 

wanted to go win the football 
game,” he said, and good for 
him. The walls have been 
closing in during this nightmare 
of a month. The team has 
underperformed — regressed 
even — and some have called 
for Hoke’s job, or the job of his 
offensive 
coordinator 
or that of 
his offensive 
line coach. 
Michigan 
Athletic 
Director Dave 
Brandon had 
to issue a 
statement of 
support for Hoke on Wednesday. 
The star recruit chose the other 
team and another said he might 
reconsider Michigan. Why? He’s 
worried about Hoke’s job. But 
Hoke went for it.

It was a rub route, the same 

one they practiced this week. 
Gardner in the shotgun, with 
Devin Funchess, Jeremy Gallon 
and Drew Dileo stacked to his 
right. Funchess ran a post, 
Gallon an out. It was supposed 
to create space for Dileo, the 
little, sure-handed receiver who 

always seems to be forgotten 
until the biggest moments. Dileo 
would surely make the catch, 
because he always does.

But Tyvis Powell jumped the 

route. Dileo never had a chance.

“I threw an interception to 

lose the game,” said Gardner, 
who put his chin on his fist in 
his press conference. He hardly 
spoke above a mumble. “There’s 
not really much else I can say.”

After the pass, Gardner 

crumpled to the ground, spent. 
He stayed there, his arms and 
legs extended out. That’s what 
you’ll remember, because that’s 

the image 
that will last. 
This one hurts 
just like the 
loss last year, 
maybe even 
more. A win 
wouldn’t have 
cured the 
offensive line 
or erased any 

losses. But it would’ve helped a 
lot. It would’ve erased some of 
the sting from a disappointing 
season. It would’ve put to rest 
any coaching rumors. So, yes, 
you’ll remember Gardner on 
the ground, because that’s what 
matters, but don’t forget the 
rest. Don’t forget how it made 
you believe, and Hoke too. It 
was a painful end, but Michigan 
lived it well.

Maybe you allowed yourself 

to think this will be a game after 
all, after the screen to Gallon 

on the first drive. The fight, 
Hoke running out to separate 
his players, the punches and the 
double middle fingers made it 
personal.

Hoke went for it because he 

wanted it as bad as his players. 
He wanted it as bad as Gardner, 
who threw a touchdown pass 
to Dileo down 14 in the fourth 
quarter. Afterward, Gardner 
tried to run off the field, limping 
so badly he nearly fell over on 
the sideline. Taylor Lewan came 
off limping after that play too, 
and bloody again. Most of these 
players are playing through 
injury because they don’t care 
how many losses they have. They 
just want to beat Ohio State.

By the time Carlos Hyde 

fumbled, and the clock showed 
plenty of time, and Gardner 
was fighting with everything he 
had left and the breaks started 
turning Michigan’s way, a ripple 
went through the stadium.

Then Jake Butt scored and 

then Funchess, and then the 
timeout and it seemed like 
destiny.

It was a hell of a death, but it 

was a hell of a game too, right up 
until the end. For the best three 
hours of the year, 7-4 Michigan 
was on top of the world.

So Hoke went for it. It was 

ballsy, and it was risky, and it 
didn’t work out. But that’s what 
you do when what you want is 
right there to take.

You go for it. You go for it 

every damn time.

Hutchins becomes winningest coach 

By ORION SANG

Daily Sports Writer

As 
Michigan 
coach 
Carol 

Hutchins embraced her players 
one by one after the second-
ranked Wolverines’ 8-0 win 
over Indiana Saturday, senior 
outfielders 
Olivia 
Richvalsky 

and Mary Sbonek crept up from 
behind carrying a large Gatorade 
jug.

Hutchins noticed the duo at the 

last second and unsuccessfully 
tried to escape the impromptu 
shower.

Nonetheless, she appreciated 

her players’ celebration of her 
new status as the all-time NCAA 
wins leader. Hutchins collected 
career win No. 1,458 on Saturday 
and added No. 1,459 on Sunday 
in a three-game sweep of the 
Hoosiers.

“One of my favorite things to 

do is to be with my team, and we 
were all in it together,” Hutchins 
said. “I told them, ‘This is not 

about me; this is about us.’ I think 
my team continues to represent 
every woman who’s ever played 
before them. That’s an important 
tradition to uphold, and it’s an 
important duty, one that comes 
with wearing the Block M.”

Now, 
Hutchins 
can 
add 

winningest softball coach in 
NCAA history to a list of life 
accomplishments that reach far 
beyond the softball field.

Hutchins, 
as 
a 
student, 

successfully 
pursued 
legal 

action against the Michigan 
State administration over equal 
treatment of female athletes, 
and hosts the Michigan Softball 
Academy, an annual event that 
both increases awareness about 
breast cancer and raises funds 
for the American Cancer Society.

“She’s more than just a softball 

coach,” 
Montemarano 
said. 

“She’s touched so many people’s 
lives, she’s affected my life in 
such a positive way and she’s 
there for you no matter what. 

She’s worked so hard — not just 
in softball — for women’s rights, 
to affect people’s lives. It’s a 
blessing to play for her and to 
learn from her every single day.”

Hutchins 
was 
quick 
to 

attribute her record to the efforts 
of those around her.

“It’s an achievement by the 

University of Michigan softball 

program,” she said. “It’s not 
a personal achievement. It’s a 
reflection of every person who 
has ever been involved with 
Michigan 
softball, 
including 

our support staff. Everybody’s 
committed to the same thing. 
We’re very proud, and I thought 
our kids were very excited to be a 
part of that.”

Seniors go out with a win
O

RLANDO, Fla. — 
Minutes after Friday’s 
Citrus Bowl ended, 

senior fullback Sione Houma 
stood near 
midfield, 
trying to 
put on his 
championship 
T-shirt. It 
started off 
as a simple 
process. He 
put his arms 
through 
the sleeves 
with ease, eager to show off 
his team’s victory. But then his 
pads got in the way, leaving 
the shirt rumpled up above his 
midsection.

Houma called one of his 

teammates over, and with 
assistance, he was finally able 
to do something he had never 
done in his collegiate career: 
be officially recognized as a 
champion.

Sure, it wasn’t the national 

championship, a Rose Bowl 
championship or a Big Ten 
championship, but for one day, it 
seemed like none of that mattered. 
Friday wasn’t the day to minimize 
Michigan’s feats.

The senior class Jim Harbaugh 

inherited for one season is 
one that arrived just after of 
Michigan’s Sugar Bowl victory 
to cap the 2011 season, right 
before the program suffered the 
downturn that led to the firing of 
Brady Hoke. Among the fifth-year 
seniors, only linebacker Desmond 
Morgan played in that Sugar Bowl.

The rest of them had never 

appeared in a game that ended 
with them wearing shirts that 
had the words “Michigan” and 
“champions” on the front.

A loss Friday would have 

put Michigan’s seniors in 
unfortunate territory: The last 
four-year period in which the 
Wolverines won neither a Big Ten 
championship nor a bowl game 
culminated in 1968.

The previous three seasons for 

the senior class ended like this: a 
heartbreaking loss in the Outback 
Bowl to South Carolina in 2012, a 
blowout loss to Kansas State in the 
Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl in 2013 
and them sitting on their couches 
last season while 10 other Big Ten 
teams played in bowls. Somehow, 
it did not crush their resolve.

“The trust and intensity these 

boys had, given everything that 
happened, we all stuck together,” 
Houma said. “And the bond we 
created, I’ll never forget that.”

They had never experienced 

anything like Friday’s postgame: 
Jake Rudock, Joe Bolden, Joe 
Kerridge and Jehu Chesson 
standing on a podium with a 
trophy they had won, maize and 
blue confetti enveloping them; 
half of a stadium in Florida, the 
state where its opponent resided, 
screaming “It’s great to be a 
Michigan Wolverine”; players 
who not only didn’t want to leave 
the field after the game, but who 
stayed so long to run around and 
give fans high-fives that they 
needed to hustle so they wouldn’t 
delay the team’s TSA airport 
security check on the way out of 
the stadium.

The fans were relentless, 

screaming for Jim Harbaugh, 
chanting his name. But he stood 
to the side of the stage, out of the 
spotlight and among a crowd, 
holding his son Jack in his arms. 
Harbaugh took pictures with a 
never-ending line of fans and 
donors, stopping only to tell 
passing game coordinator Jedd 
Fisch that Friday’s offensive 
performance was as good as he 
has ever seen.

Harbaugh’s handprint on the 

win, on his team, was evident 
through it all. Michigan was 
relentless Friday, pounding 
Florida’s top-10 defense from 
start to finish. Things weren’t 
much different on the other side 
of the ball — Bolden said he was 
surprised Florida managed to 
score seven points. But if every 
day of 2015 was about Harbaugh, 
the first day of 2016 wasn’t really 

about him at all: It was about 
Michigan’s senior class.

Bolden, as much as anyone else, 

is emblematic of the struggles of 
his classmates. His teams have 
suffered through four losses 
to Ohio State, nothing easy to 
cope with for an Ohio native; 
he was ejected from Michigan’s 
game against Michigan State 
for a questionable targeting call 
that changed the complexion 
of the game; and last year, in 
the middle of a 5-7 season, he 
was called upon as one of a few 
team representatives charged 
with frequently explaining the 
inexplicable to the media.

But Friday eased much of that 

pain. There will, Bolden noted 
after the game, be a banner 
commemorating this bowl victory 
hanging in Schembechler Hall 
for decades. The final game of 
his career was a victory, and the 
dominating fashion in which 
they won made it all the more 
satisfying.

“It’s also memorable that you 

beat the runner up in the SEC that 
bad,” Bolden said. “If I remember 
correctly, I think it was worse 
than ’Bama beat them. It goes to 
show that when we’re clicking on 
all cylinders, in my opinion, we 
can beat anyone in the NCAA.”

The Wolverines will try to 

prove that in 2016, when this 
year’s senior class has moved on 
to other endeavors. Harbaugh 
will have to try to top this 
year, his favorite season in 
football. He had a team full of 
“jackhammers,” players who not 
only bought into his message, but 
lived it every day. They helped 
bring Michigan back into national 
prominence, and did it while 
mentoring the players who will 
follow them.

And in their final act as 

Wolverines, the senior class 
helped give the younger players 
their first chance to put on 
championship T-shirts. And 
for next time, they’ll have had 
practice. They won’t have to worry 
about the shirts getting stuck.

ST. PAUL, Minn. — Three 

hundred sixty one days ago, 
the 
Michigan 
hockey 
team 

found itself in a situation eerily 
similar to that of Saturday 
night — taking the ice for the 
Big Ten Championship against 
Minnesota.

At the time, as the Wolverines 

entered the championship game 
at Joe Louis Arena, they were 
on the wrong side of the NCAA 
Tournament bubble, in dire 
need of an upset against the 
Golden Gophers to keep their 
season alive. But when the final 
horn sounded, Michigan was 
left with a scoreboard reading 
4-2 in Minnesota’s favor to 
cement its campaign.

In the 361 days that followed, 

though, 
that 
dynamic 
had 

changed drastically.

This time, the Wolverines 

had the cards in their hands 
entering 
the 
championship 

game — having already solidified 
a NCAA Tournament berth with 
only retribution to truly play 
for. And now, Minnesota was 

the team in need of a season-
preserving victory.

And Michigan was able to 

change 
the 
most 
important 

part of the former narrative, 
capturing 
the 
Big 
Ten 

Championship with a 5-3 victory 
against thwe Golden Gophers at 
Xcel Energy Center.

“Up until tonight there’s 

been five banners hung and 
we have four of them,” said 
Minnesota coach Don Lucia. 
“We were trying to get a fifth, 
and Michigan didn’t have one 
— and that’s a proud program. 
… That can sometimes be the 
driving force.”

After 
three 
unanswered 

Minnesota goals left Michigan 
in a 3-2 hole entering the third 
period, 
freshman 
forward 

Kyle Connor and sophomore 
defenseman 
Zach 
Werenski 

rose to the occasion during 
crunch time.

A few short minutes into 

the final frame, the freshman 
brought the Wolverines back to 
life with an equalizer.

Connor received a cross-ice 

pass from junior forward JT 
Compher, and was alone against 

Schierhorn. He hesitated and 
baited Schierhorn to come out 
of the net before faking one shot 
and deking right to leave both the 
Gophers’ goaltender on his back 
and the puck in the net.

Twelve minutes later, with 

Michigan on the power play, 
Werenski gave his team the 
Big Ten Championship. The 
Wolverines rotated the puck 
around 
the 
offensive 
zone, 

tallying a number of shots, 
before it ended up at the point on 
Werenski’s stick.

The blueliner let one loose, and 

the goal horn lit up. Michigan 4, 
Minnesota 3.

“In between the second and 

third, (last year is) something we 
talked about, is ‘We owe them,’ ” 
Werenski said. “They ended our 
season last year, so we came out 
with some fire.”

Behind Werenski’s goal and 

an empty-netter that followed, 
Michigan changed the most 
important part of the former 
narrative. It has a banner to hang 
at Yost Ice Arena.

And more than anything, it 

exorcised its demons that have 
been following it all season.
