The University of Michigan, 

though established in Ann Arbor 
in 1837, opened its first building 
in Detroit in 1817. Before this, 
the Michigan Territory had no 
organized schools, and very few 
students were prepared to attend 
a university.

The year 1817 itself was crucial 

in the development of Michigan, 
and on Tuesday evening, Brian 
Dunnigan, 
William 
Clements 

Library associate director and 
curator 
of 
maps, 
addressed 

members of the public in this 
year’s Founders Day Lecture 
highlighting Michigan in 1817.

Through the use of photographs 

and maps, Dunnigan explained 
the original University building 
was commonly referred to as the 
“academy” 
until 
construction 

began in October 1837 to create 
Ann Arbor’s campus, a project 
lasting until 1858.

Detroit, which included the 

first University building and 
published the first successful 
local newspaper in Michigan in 
1817, began blossoming in the 
early 1820s with the beginnings 
of the transportation industry. 
Dunnigan said many Americans 
who first saw the city situated on 
the Detroit River often compared 
it to Philadelphia.

“Detroit was the prime town 

of the old northwest,” Dunnigan 
said.

Award-winning author John 

Pomfret discussed the effects 
of the Trump presidency on 
relations between the United 
States and China to a packed 
room in the School of Social 
Work Tuesday afternoon.

Pomfret, 
who 
spent 
20 

years living in China, likened 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s 

rhetoric toward the country 
to that of Denis Kearney — a 
prominent U.S. politician in 
the 1870s and 1880s — in an 
event as part of the University 
of Michigan Lieberthal-Rogel 
Center for Chinese Studies 
Noon Lecture Series. 

Kearney was the head of 

the Workingmen’s Party in 
California, and was known 
for his often racist and anti-
Chinese views.

“Kearney took this populist 

anger 
or 
fear 
of 
Chinese 

industriousness 
and 
turned 

it into a political movement,” 
Pomfret said.

Pomfret 
also 
compared 

Trump 
to 
Chairman 
Mao 

Zedong, a comparison that 
drew laughs from the crowd. 
He said Trump’s tendency to 
call for a “government for the 
people” is just one similarity to 
Mao’s leadership.

“In 
Trump’s 
maddening 

unpredictability, (Maoists) saw 
Chairman Mao’s most favorite 
aphorism, 
which 
is 
‘there 

is chaos under heaven, the 

situation is excellent,’ ” Pomfret 
said.

Pomfret said he believes 

under the Trump presidency, 
the United States is back on the 
track of facilitating China’s rise, 
explaining how U.S. wallets 
have funded China in their wars 
and education.

“Over the course of the last 

decade, perhaps longer, the 
Chinese system has been better 
at enabling China to benefit 

from the United States than 
the American system has been 
at allowing America to benefit 
from China,” Pomfret said.

He also expressed concern for 

the upcoming summit between 
current Chinese President Xi 
Jinping and Trump, fearing 
Trump has no strategy for the 
meeting. 
Debunking 
many 

of the problems Trump has 
with China, such as currency 
manipulation and the Chinese 

cheating the United States on 
trade, he reasoned these are not 
the real problems the United 
States should be focusing on.

At the end of his talk, Pomfret 

characterized 
the 
current 

Chinese government as one of 
the future, and Trump’s United 
States as one of the past.

“If you look at China right 

now, it’s a country that is 
clearly focused on creating the 

Graduate students and faculty 

gathered Tuesday to listen to 
speakers discuss the Graduate 
Employees’ Organization’s roots 
and current presence on campus 
as part of LSA’s bicentennial-
themed semester.

The event — under the title, 

“U-M Works Because We Do,” 
which was borrowed from an 
old GEO slogan from the 1970s 
— featured two former GEO 
organizers, Sandra Silbertstein 
and Scott Schneider, as well as 
a member of the union’s current 
bargaining team, Nora Krinitsky. 
The speakers discussed in detail 
the founding years of the GEO, 
and how it is important to have 
these discussions during the 
bicentennial.

“The name of the event really 

says it all,” Krinitsky said. “GSIs 
proved 23 percent of student 
contact hours at the University of 
Michigan, which is a significant 
portion of the teaching labor 
that happens here, so if you want 
to understand how we got here 
over the last 200 years, GEO is a 
critical part of that story.”

The event aimed to provide a voice to under-represented students on campus

Amid the success of the 

recent 
events 
“The 
Vagina 

Monologues” 
and 
“Hijabi 

Monologues,” LSA junior Heba 
Al-Saghir found she wanted 
to organize a similar, more 

inclusive 
event 
that 
would 

still provide a place for often 
underrepresented voices on the 
University of Michigan campus. 
This inspiration produced the 
“Muslim Monologues” event, 
which 
was 
hosted 
by 
the 

Muslim Students’ Association 
and took place Thursday night 
at Palmer Commons.

“(The 
event) 
provides 
a 

forum for Muslim students 
to express their thoughts and 
ideas in an open and accepting 
environment,” she said. “It’s 
also 
important 
because 
it 

encourages 
people 
of 
all 

religions and cultures to hear 
Muslim voices that may paint 
a very different picture than 

what they are used to hearing 
in the media. By humanizing 
Muslims, we are promoting 
tolerance, coexistence and a 
brighter future.”

that produce zero emissions, which 
aligns with one of the TRI’s main 
goals of reducing carbon dioxide

A study by researchers at 

Oxford University in London 

found Twitter feeds in the state 

of Michigan were filled with 

fake or untrustworthy news 

accounts before and after the 2016 

presidential election.

The researchers stated that 

between Nov. 1 and Nov. 11, 

fake news was as common as 

professional news content shared 

on Twitter feeds. A total of 46.5 

percent of the content appearing 

in Michigan as political news was 

“of an untrustworthy provenance 

or falls under the definition of 

propaganda based on its use of 

language and emotional appeals,” 

according to the study.

“The proportion of 

professional news content being 

shared hit its lowest point the day 

before the election,” the paper 

reads.

President Donald Trump 

won Michigan’s electoral votes 

by a margin of 10,704 votes 

over Democrat Hillary Clinton. 

According to the study, the “junk 

news” also appeared in several 

battleground states, including 

Wisconsin. Whether they had 

any influence on the results in 

unknown.

The study included 138,686 

tweets from accounts claiming 

to be “Michigan users,” with 

more than twice as many tweets 

featuring pro-Trump hashtags 

as pro-Clinton ones. Researchers 

admitted one limitation of the 

study was its inability to use 

tweets without pro-Trump or 

Clinton hashtags.

Though U.S. intelligence 

officials state election results 

were not hacked by Russian 

Intelligence, the ranking members 

of the Senate Intelligence 

Committee said Russia might have 

used “internet trolls” to put out 

alleged fake news in Michigan and 

other swing states.

“It’s been reported to me 

— and we’ve got to find this 

out — whether they were able to 

in effect (target) specific areas 

in Wisconsin, Michigan and 

Pennsylvania,” U.S. Sen. Mark 

Warner (D–Va.) told The Detroit 

News.

Schools like the University of 

Michigan are taking measures to 

spread awareness of fake news 

in the media. In fall 2017, a one-

credit class titled “Fake News, 

Lies, and Propaganda: How to Sort 

Fact from Fiction” will be offered 

to undergraduate students, aiming 

to dispel biases about the news 

and teaching students how to look 

at media with a more critical eye.

Central 
Student 

Government’s new president 
and vice president, LSA junior 
Anushka Sarkar and Public 
Policy junior Nadine Jawad, 
were sworn in Tuesday night 
for their first meeting.

“I 
couldn’t 
believe 
the 

overwhelming victory, to see 
all of our (representatives) 
elected, 
to 
be 
the 
first 

woman of color ever elected 
to this position, and just 
the 
overwhelming 
amount 

of support we got from the 
community,” Jawad said on 
the night of their win. “We just 
made history.”

eMerge ran on a platform 

of raising student voices on 
campus 
with 
a 
campaign 

standing 
on 
three 
pillars 

of 
voice, 
opportunity 
and 

momentum.

Such 
plans 
include 

advocating 
the 
reduction 

of the number of exams a 
student can take on a day 
from four to three as well 
as the expansion of in-state 
tuition from undocumented 
undergraduates 
to 
include 

undocumented graduate and 
nontraditional students.

The committee, also sworn 

in, mostly comprises eMerge 
candidates. 
Representatives 

such as LSA sophomore Ali 
Rosenblatt believe they were 
a split between experienced 
representatives and CSG first-
timers.

“I think there is a good 

amount of new reps — that 
is ultimately why I wanted 
to run as speaker, to help 
with the transition because 
(when) I was a new rep, it was 

overwhelming,” she said.

She hopes to explain the 

more complicated aspects of 
CSG to new representatives 
like LSA freshman Marianne 
Drysdale.

“It is very overwhelming 

at first and I kind of have my 
footing coming off being a 
fresh new rep, I hope that I can 
bring some new insight to kind 
of hit the ground running,” 
Drysdale said.

LSA 
sophomore 
Seth 

Schostak is also an experienced 
CSG member who is now 
serving as the chair of the 
communications committee.

“I am definitely excited,” he 

said. “One of my goals for next 
year is to really increase the 
transparency 
between 
CSG 

and the student body. I think 
we have already been working 
on that a lot this past year and 
I think given past experience 

and 
having 
(first-time 

CSG representatives like) 
Marianne on board able to 
reach that goal.”

One 
resolution 
was 

discussed at the meeting. 
While it has not yet been 
passed, it aimed to approve 
the 
funds 
to 
provide 

phone-charging stations in 
the Shapiro Undergraduate 
Library on Central Campus 
and the Duderstadt Center 
on North Campus. This 
resolution is left over from 
former 
CSG 
President 

David Shafer’s old funds 
for 
chargers 
in 
the 

Fishbowl and Duderstadt 
Center. One of the reasons 
to provide the chargers is 
to protect students from 
walking home alone at 
night with a dead phone. 
The 
assembly 
hopes 

to allocate $150 for 15 
chargers.

The 
resolution 
was 

sent to the Resolutions 
Committee 
for 
further 

reads.

Journalist Jon Cohen spoke 

about methods to curb the 
stigma 
behind 
HIV/AIDS 

Tuesday evening in an event 
that was part of the Pulitzer 
Center’s 
collaboration 

with 
the 
Communication 

Studies 
Department. 
About 

20 University of Michigan 
students and faculty attended 
the 
event, 
where 
Cohen 

especially covered efforts to 
end AIDS in Africa and the 
United States.

With 
funding 
from 
the 

Pulitzer Center, Cohen created 
a project of several stories that 
examine attempts across the 
United States and parts of 
Africa to reduce the spread of 
and eradicate HIV/AIDS. The 
talk is part of the initiative of 
the Pulitzer Center’s initiative 
to support journalists and 
bring them to the University to 
present their work.

In his presentation, Cohen, 

who 
works 
for 
Science, 

expressed 
his 
belief 
that 

mainstream 
media 
have 

largely forgotten about HIV. 
Cohen explained that this is 
because a fear of infectious 
disease 
largely 
drives 
the 

public, and media outlets serve 
the interests of the public. 
However, 
Cohen 
reminded 

the audience that there are 
37 million people infected 
globally, with approximately 2 
million people newly infected 
each year.

While 
Cohen 
supports 

the 
Joint 
United 
Nations 

Programme on HIV/AIDS’s 
goal of reaching 90-90-90 — 
90 percent of people who have 
the disease know they are 

infected, 90 percent of people 
seek health care, 90 percent 
of people are on antiretroviral 
drugs 
— 
he 
emphasized 

this goal has not been met. 
According to Cohen, just 11 
million out of the 37 million 
people infected have all three 
goals achieved.

From 
Cohen’s 
travels 

around 
the 
world 
and 

observations of attempts to 
reduce the transmission of 
HIV, he noted there are some 
critical post-infection efforts 
that can be done to reduce the 
transmission.

Cohen 
cited 
having 
an 

advocate 
for 
individual 

patients to encourage them or 
count their pills are two of the 
ways Cohen believes can help 
end the HIV/AIDS epidemic. 

“Every 
place 
that 
has 

remarkable success has one 
individual who takes charge 
and says, ‘This is on me,’ ” 
Cohen said. “The other thing is 
self-criticism, is being able to 
look others squarely in the eye 
and say, ‘We’re failing here.’ ”

Cohen believes preventative 

measures are just as important 
as 
treating 
those 
living 

with 
the 
infection. 
Cohen 

emphasized what he believes 
to be the importance of at-risk 
men and women to receive and 
take pre-exposure prophylaxis 
drugs, which are used to 
prevent the contraction of 
disease in people who have not 
yet been exposed.

Business graduate student 

Julian Smyth echoed Cohen’s 
belief that more at-risk people 
should be taking PrEP drugs 
and shared his reasons for 
taking the drugs himself.

“I’m a single, gay man; 

I 
don’t 
think 
that 
I’m 

particularly at risk, but I think 

that’s one of the issues people 
have with PrEP,” Smyth said. 
“I think one of the other issues 
is that people who can afford 
to take it are people who are 
insured; it tends to be people 
who are more educated, who 
know about it. So we’re not the 
ones who are necessarily at the 
most risk.”

While Smyth may be correct 

about the types of people who 
have access to PrEP drugs, 
Cohen emphasized that HIV 
does not only affect those 
living in poverty.

“Yes, it is a disease of 

poverty, but it’s also a disease 
of wealth,” Cohen said.

Cohen 
explained 
while 

there are people infected from 
many different socioeconomic 
backgrounds, those who are 
marginalized in society — be it 
from race, gender, sexuality or 
social class — are the ones who 
face the most stigma.

Cohen mentioned a town 

in Zimbabwe where there is a 
monthly “drug day,” or a day 
where everyone in the village 
gets tested for HIV. In this 
system, community members 
know of one another’s HIV 
status, and there is a stigma 
for those who do not get 
tested.

According to Cohen, there 

should be more discussion 
surrounding HIV/AIDS and 
he hopes his research will 
contribute to an increased 
focus around the disease and 
those infected by it.

“I love giving voices to 

people,” Cohen said. “The 
scientific term for these groups 
of people is ‘marginalized’ 
— the real word is ‘hated.’ 
They’re hated in many parts of 
the world, and I like to show 
their humanity.”

Brian Dunnigan, Curator of Maps at the William L. Clements Library, uses images of original maps to describe the Universtiy of Michigan in the 
1800’s in Hatcher Gallery on Tuesday.

M APPING MICHIGAN

Dunnigan also highlighted 

the 
presence 
of 
Native 

American tribes on Michigan 
land, and their resistance of 
the encroachment of settlers 
beginning in the 1750s. This 
resistance, along with struggles 
obtaining 
previously 
owned 

British territory, were factors 
influencing the United States’s 
endeavors 
in 
procuring 

Michigan land.

University 
alum 
Lejla 

Bajgoric, who attended the event, 
explained she was interested in 
hearing how the presentation 
would highlight this aspect 
of 
U.S. 
history, 
specifically 

with 
euphemisms 
regarding 

acquisition of territory from 
Native American tribes.

“At the founding of Michigan 

there’s still this huge Native 
American population, so I was 

interested in how that would 
be spoken about,” she said. 
“When you want to talk about 
developments and progress, how 
do you reconcile that with the 
fact that you are displacing and 
forcibly removing people from 
the land?”

One of the most prominent 

topics in the presentation was 
Mackinac Island, presently a 
popular tourist destination in the 
Straits of Mackinac. Dunnigan 
explained Mackinac, originally 
purchased by the British in 1781 
and garnered by U.S. control 
several years later, was known 
for its natural wonders from 
the beginning. In its early days 
of settlement, the island went 
from holding 300 people in 
the winters to accommodating 
3,000 in the summers.

“The place had a very early 

reputation for being scenic,” 
he said. “A visitor in 1816 says, 
‘The first view of this interesting 
island justified the experience 
and the expectation it had 

incited.’ ”

Information fifth-year senior 

Monica 
Chen 
attended 
the 

lecture and said she felt the 
presentation’s coverage of the 
different methods by which the 
United States collected territory 
was very interesting.

“I’m 
not 
actually 
from 

Michigan, so I think it was really 
cool to get a look into a town that 
is not on the coast, but it actually 
kind of is on the northern coast 
and it borders Canada, and just 
how important and influential 
waterways are in development 
of places,” she said.

At the conclusion of the 

presentation, Dunnigan spoke 
of the Reading Room, one of 
the 
most 
historic 
locations 

within 
Clements 
Library, 

where most of the information 
and 
photographs 
from 
the 

presentation came from.

“I think our readers and our 

visitors find the place friendly, 
interesting and worth reading 
about,” he said.

of reducing global average new-
vehicle CO2 emissions by 90 percent 
by 2050,” Eric Krotkov, chief science 
officer at TRI, stated in a University 
Record article about the research.

To create a more effective 

battery, the team will work to 
combine artificial intelligence with 
the physics of materials, which will 
eventually enable them to predict 
material properties, Gavini said. 

“We are solving equations at 

smaller scales and then we are 
collecting a lot of data on a small 
scale and then we are using artificial 
intelligence to figure out how is 
the materials of physics at that 
particular scale and then passing 
it on to the next scale,” Gavini said. 
“The hope is that eventually, if we 
do this the right way, then we will be 
able to predict material properties.”

Duraisamy 
noted 
the 

significance 
of 
simulations 
in 

determining material properties, 
noting the use of the laws of physics 
and data can make the simulations 
more effective.

“The goal is to run more accurate 

simulations, and to run more 
accurate simulations you combine 
physical laws with data,” he said. 

The simulations used in the 

research will include the ConFlux 
cluster, a computing platform 
that combines simulations with 
data sets to increase the speed of 
material development. 

Duraisamy 
believes 
the 

simulations will complement the 
experimentation, 
allowing 
the 

research to be more effective.

“If you run the simulation, you 

can get any property you want, 
anywhere you want,” he said. 

Duraisamy 
also 
said 
the 

simulations 
will 
make 
the 

experimentation more expansive.

“If you can use physical laws 

along with data, then we can make 
these simulations much more 
affordable and realistic,” he said.

Gavini 
said 
he 
appreciated 

the 
investment, 
specifically 

acknowledging the TRI’s emphasis 
on fundamental research that can 
expand across multiple disciplines.

“The Toyota Research Institute 

is actually funding fundamental 
science problems, which is very 
unlike what may happen to other 
industrial 
investments 
in 
the 

University,” Gavini said. “They are 

not hesitant to take from high-risk 
problems and I think that’s very 
good for the University, because 
at the University we work on such 
problems.”

Duraisamy 
echoed 
the 

importance 
of 
emphasizing 

fundamental research, stating it 
enables more widespread results.

“There 
are 
many 
different 

aspects to this, and since we 
are doing basic or fundamental 
research, the implications can be 
across the board,” he said.

The TRI also invested in research 

projects at Stanford University, 
the 
Massachusetts 
Institute 

of 
Technology, 
the 
University 

at 
Buffalo, 
the 
University 
of 

Connecticut and Ilika, a United 
Kingdom-based material science 
company. 

Gavini 
recognizes 
the 

importance 
of 
the 
project, 

acknowledging the benefits to the 
University. 

“This is a significant investment 

that Toyota is making in the 
University of Michigan and in our 
group, and this will continue going 
forward,” he said. “Hopefully it will 
be a successful project and we will 
have a very fruitful collaboration 
with these guys down the line.”

In 
1970, 
the 
GEO 
was 

established at the University 
of Michigan, though it was not 
certifieduntil 
1974, 
and 
was 

among the first graduate student 
unions in the United States. 
Silbertstein discussed how the 
era’s political climate fueled the 
formation of the union.

“We 
could 
demonstrate 

because anything we got could 
be taken away, so we organized,” 
Silbertstein said. “I think it’s 
always true that there’s the 
question of ‘Are people moving?’ 
In order to get what you want, 
actions must be taken and you 
have to win hearts and minds.”

The GEO, as an organizing 

group, sought to make its voices 
and demands heard. According 
to Silbertstein, many TAs and 
GSIs who were organizing at the 
time had their roots in the civil 
rights movement and Vietnam 
War protests. Their tactics were 
grounded in leaflets with satirical 
tones and picketing.

It was not until 1975 that the 

GEO movement held a month-
long strike and secured its 
first contract. The GEO was 

demanding fair wages, improved 
working 
conditions 
and 

nondiscrimination. The strike 
had a lasting implication and, 
according to Schneider, carried 
both symbolic and instrumental 
victories.

“We talk about the strike and 

the importance of the solidarity,” 
Schneider said. “To me, one of the 
main reasons we won that one 
is because we have picket lines 
up and other unions refused to 
cross those lines. In particular, 
the Teamster Union stopped 
the Biology Department from 
picking up its trash, (and it) lost 
a lot of federal money too. This 
teamwork with the Teamsters 
Union was a critical element in 
winning the strike.”

Krinitsky 
brought 
the 

conversation to the present by 
placing the current situation 
of the GEO in the broader 
labor movement and discussed 
the future of campus labor 
organizing.

“When graduate students are 

mounting a contract campaign, 
they’re not just asking for wages,” 
Krinitsky 
said. 
“Often 
that’s 

an argument that we get at the 
bargaining table. Our members 
are really motivated by questions 
of equity. They care about the 
marginalized population among 

our membership and care about 
ensuring their protections.”

This year, the GEO aims to 

secure another contract, the first 
of which to be under the right-to-
work laws, laws which prohibit 
people from being compelled to join 
a labor union. Krinitsky said during 
the event that the current platform 
is ambitious and focuses heavily 
on diversity, equity and inclusion, 
paralleling 
the 
University’s 

initiative.

“We are focused on diversity, 

equity and inclusion, words that are 
really affiliated with U of M, you 
can’t really go anywhere without 
hearing them,” he said. “Well, when 
we were forming our campaign we 
wanted to have the University put 
its money where its mouth is when 
it comes to these topics.”

School of Information student 

Vidhya Aravind said in an earlier 
interview 
that 
she 
currently 

works part time on the University 
Library’s 
implementation 

team 
for 
the 
DEI 
initiative. 

Aravind said these positions are 
demanding, justifying demands for 
compensation on par with other 
graduate positions.

“I 
think 
it’s 
important 
to 

recognize that diversity labor is 
labor,” she said.” It takes a lot of 
effort, a lot of time, a lot of energy 
and a lot of expertise.”

industries of the future,” Pomfret 
said. “You look at biopharma, 
aerospace, industrial advanced 
engineering. They’re devoting 
huge amounts of money to these 
areas, whereas Trump is trying 
to reopen coal mines, pushing 
back EPA regulations, changing 
mile per gallon statistics so we’ll 
be able to help out factories in the 
heartland. So his priorities, in a 
way, are priorities that basically 
focus on the economy that the 
United States had in the 1950s, 
whereas China wants to create a 
21st-century economy.”

An hour at the end of the 

lecture 
was 
reserved 
for 

questions, and many audience 

members were curious about 
the upcoming elections in South 
Korea and the effect the current 
animosity toward immigrants 
could have on the education of 
Chinese immigrants in America.

This last point follows the 

Detroit News op-ed from the 
presidents of three Michigan 
Universities, 
including 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel. The letter emphasized 
the importance of standing by 
our international students.

“Students 
from 
different 

places also help our campuses 
better reflect the global diversity 
our graduates are expected to 
understand, and they enhance 
the quality of our teaching and 
research,” they wrote.

Pomfret 
shared 
a 
similar 

sentiment, 
and 
found 
the 

potential of growing animosity 
toward 
immigrants 
to 
be 

detrimental to the United States. 

“As 
the 
anti-immigration 

policy builds up, if that is 
successful, obviously it’s going 
to smack all foreigners in the 
United States who are getting 
their education here,” Pomfret 
said.

Pomfret said with Trump 

as president, the United States 
is moving toward a dangerous 
position of isolation.

“By becoming America first, 

we turn around and we’ve got 
nobody behind us,” Pomfret 
said. “The United States became 
a superpower because we had 
friends, but now we’re actually 
increasingly like China. China 
doesn’t 
have 
many 
friends 

either.”

media of spoken word, singing, 
storytelling and even a piece 
played on the piano.

LSA 
freshman 
Ayah 

Kutmah kicked off the event 
with a short personal essay, 
stressing the role of her hijab 
in defining her identity and 
her constant battle with the 
common 
perception 
that 

it 
oppresses 
her. 
Kutmah 

outlined the ways in which 
she learned to conform to 
society in her earlier years, 
but also recognized how she 
has grown as confident hijab-
wearing woman, especially at 
the University.

“I define my journey with 

my hijab as a personal rebellion 
against society, one that is on 
me to define my own identity 
on my own terms,” she said. 
“The point I want to make is 
this: I do not allow the hijab to 
limit me, so why do you?”

LSA 
senior 
Maham 

Shaikh performed her poem 
“Personifying Islamophobia,” 
illustrating 
the 
varying 

experiences 
of 
Muslims. 

She 
highlighted 
that 
even 

though she does not wear the 

headscarf, 
she 
experiences 

Islamophobia as a presence she 
deals with daily. In a symbolic 
gesture, she ripped a paper 
with the word “Islamophobia,” 
displaying her triumph over 
this battle.

Following 
Shaikh, 

University 
alum 
Amir 

Kamouneh gave a personal 
statement 
to 
the 
audience 

about the importance of events 
like these in strengthening 
people in this world, amid 
current political turmoil and 
war. He experiencing things 
in his home country of Iran, 
such as the Iranian revolution, 
to the 9/11 terrorist attack and 
current politics. He said he has 
found there is always a good 

side to support.

“I’m proud that you came 

out to say no to hate, whether 
you’re Muslim or non-Muslim, 
it takes character in today’s 
world to say no to easy 
scapegoating, to easy blame,” 
he said.

LSA freshman Arwa Gayar 

followed 
with 
a 
spoken 

word poem expressing her 
frustration at the lack of 
ethnicity checkbox for Arabs 
in the University application.

“I don’t think you can limit 

my culture to the color of 
my skin,” she said. “I don’t 
think the option of ‘other’ is 
representative of my kin. Am 
I not important enough for my 
very own box? Tell me to write 
in whatever because ‘we don’t 
see color’ — I will not act as 
another diversity buffer. I will 
take up space.”

Following 
the 
event, 

University 
alum 
Misha 

Shaikh said it made her feel 
strengthened and supported 
in her Muslim identity.

“It brings back a lot of 

emotions of my experiences 
with 
Islamophobia, 
and 

the 
hatred 
that 
Muslims 

experience,” 
she 
said. 

“However, it was also very fun 
and relaxing, so it was kind of 
a mix.”

MONOLOGUES

“T

his is what democracy 
is all about,” remarked 
my 
representative, 

Dave Trott (R–Mich.), to a room 
crowded full of constituents, many 
of 
whom 
had 
just 

repeatedly 
chanted 

“shame” in response to 
one of his statements. In 
many ways, this town 
hall was a microcosm of 
a larger conflict between 
Republican congressmen 
and 
their 
alienated 

constituents that has 
been happening across 
the United States since 
Trump’s inauguration.

Trott was elected to 

represent the Republican-leaning 
and 
probably 
gerrymandered 

District 11 in 2014, and this recent 
town hall was his first since 2015. 
Since Trump has taken office, 
this perceived lack of community 
engagement has angered many of 
Trott’s constituents, particularly 
liberals. Some were even turned 
away from his office by police, 
leaving them unable to confront 
Trott with their concerns and fears 
about his support for Trump.

Soon, the negative coverage 

revolving around his absence, 
including “Trott-less town halls” 
where protesters brought a live 
chicken to the podium in Trott’s 
absence, were too much to bear. 
Trott finally held a town hall, 
at 8 a.m. the Saturday after St. 
Patrick’s Day.

The timing of the town hall 

seemed designed to bring the 
smallest number of people possible, 
but not even the snowy weather 
was an effective deterrent. About 
1,000 people came to the town hall, 
some to voice support, but most to 
share their rage. The room was too 
small to fit most of the protesters 
who came to attend, leaving 
hundreds outside in the cold.

The town hall itself was full 

of anger and frustration. Many 
people screamed, chanted and 
raised red cards whenever Trott 
said something they disagreed 
with. Unsurprisingly, this was 
not conducive to a productive 
conversation.

It’s easy to understand the 

rage these people felt. Politics 
can make the average citizen 
feel impotent and incapable of 
making a difference, which can be 
particularly scary when policies 
have the power to deprive them 
of their health care and ruin their 
environment. 
Politics 
can 
be 

deeply personal, and emotions are 
often unavoidable during political 
discussions. This can be amplified 
when your representative doesn’t 
represent your views and is 

unwilling to engage 
you.

Trott guaranteed 

this response when 
he avoided having a 
town hall for so long; 
he let his frustrated 
constituents brew in 
their own rage for 
weeks before they 
got a chance to air 
their concerns.

Prior to the town 

hall, 
Trott 
stated, 

“If the purpose of the ‘new’ 
town hall is to be disruptive 
and draw attention to people’s 
concerns over the replacement 
for the Affordable Care Act or 
President Trump’s immigration 
policies, I don’t know that a town 
hall is going to be particularly 
productive.”

This 
gives 
away 
Trott’s 

mindset: He thinks he knows 
that his opinions are right, and no 
matter what his constituents say, 
he will not change his opinions. 
Furthermore, he fails to recognize 
the importance of conveying 
his message to his constituents. 
Trott’s insistence on treating 
their demands for a town hall as 
a chore, rather than his absolutely 
essential civic duty, doomed the 
town hall from the beginning.

Representatives 
and 
their 

constituents who have different 
opinions shouldn’t just “agree to 
disagree” when it comes to policy 
— the stakes are too high to avoid 
considering opposing views. Trott 
needs to listen to his constituents 
of all political leanings, and he 
must 
answer 
their 
questions 

earnestly and honestly. This is hard 
to do, though, when the only reason 
you’re having a town hall is because 
you’ve been publicly shamed into 
having one. It doesn’t come across 
as particularly genuine.

All of this isn’t to say, though, 

that the behavior of the town hall 
attendees was acceptable. Trott 
has real legislative power, and the 
protesters dashed any chance they 
had of influencing how he wields 
that power when they chose to 
angrily yell over his words. This 
pattern, unfortunately, has been 
playing out across the country as 
more and more liberal activists 
take to town halls.

Is the point of attending these 

town halls to make your legislator 
think critically about their political 
beliefs and about how their votes 
will affect their constituents? Or is 
it to shame them? If the goal is to be 
constructive and make a difference, 
people need to attend these town 
halls and make a genuine effort to 
engage, not just yell.

This, of course, still won’t 

make a difference in the world 
if the legislator in question isn’t 
willing to listen with an open mind 
and answer questions earnestly 
and honestly. Legislators can’t 
just go through the motions of a 
town hall to avoid being publicly 
ridiculed. 
Democracy 
requires 

an open exchange of ideas and 
representatives who actually care 
about all of their constituents, not 
just the ones who voted for them.

Sen. Tom Cotton (R–Ark.) is 

an example of how effective this 
exchange of ideas can be. Cotton, 
after much public pressure, hosted 
a town hall that was similarly 
raucous. His constituents were 
equally angry, but they were able 
to ultimately achieve a dialogue. 
Cotton 
was 
confronted 
with 

the realities of how health care 
reform would affect some of his 
constituents, 
and 
he 
listened 

carefully to their concerns. Instead 
of treating the town hall as a chore 
to get over with, Cotton extended 
the event by 30 minutes. 

Although the direct effect of 

the town hall is difficult to gauge, 
Cotton did end up opposing 
the American Health Care Act. 
Cotton’s statement on the bill said 
it did “little to address the core 
problem of Obamacare: rising 
premiums and deductibles, which 
are making insurance unaffordable 
for too many Arkansans.” To me, 
this language suggests that Cotton 
really did listen to his constituents 
and take their concerns to heart.

I hope that Trott learns from 

Cotton and other legislators who 
are making an effort to engage 
with their constituents. If Trott 
really cares about the people 
he represents, he needs to hold 
another town hall, and actually 
make an effort this time.

I also hope that those attending 

the town hall work to contain their 
anger and articulately register 
their concerns with him. That is, 
after all, how minds get changed 
and “what democracy is all about.”

M

y dad loves to talk to 
taxi drivers. When 
family trips would 

take us to big cities, sitting in 
the back of a taxi was more like 
sitting in a living 
room, where small 
talk easily turned to 
real talk. My parents 
have long taught me 
the 
importance 
of 

talking 
to 
people, 

showing them respect 
by 
being 
curious 

about 
their 
lives, 

rather 
than 
being 

silent. With every taxi 
driver, my dad would 
ask them where they’re from, 
and that simple question would 
explode into a conversation about 
their journey, a journey parallel 
to our own, yet one which had 
now suddenly and spectacularly 
intersected with ours.

While my dad would be 

beaming 
and 
thoroughly 

invested in these conversations, 
I would feel the opposite. 
My 
cheeks 
would 
become 

hot, my hands clammy as I 
sat, embarrassed of my dad’s 
eagerness to talk to the people 
who were driving us around. 
I would sink lower and lower 
in my seat or stare intently out 
the window in an effort to avoid 
the conversation. Conversations 
would include personal stories 
about their family and their 
aspirations, 
and 
delve 
into 

their opinions on everything 
happening in the world outside 
the yellow cab. Yet, as I grew 
older, the embarrassment of 
these situations faded. In its 
place was curiosity. I began to 
listen. And now, like father like 
daughter, I talk to my driver. 
And as technology progressed 
and markets was changed, the 
taxi driver is replaced with an 
Uber driver.

Despite recent controversies, 

Uber is still alive and well. I would 
like to point out now that this is 
not a praise for Uber, but rather, a 
praise for what ride-hailing apps 

of the kind have inadvertently 
created: a new environment, ripe 
for human connection.

On a campus like the University 

of Michigan’s, Uber is a life saver 

when the journey is 
too cold, too late, too 
far or, more often, all 
of the above. I imagine 
all of you have, at 
some point, sat in 
the back of an Uber, 
both alone and with 
friends. 
Yet, 
while 

being an innovative 
and 
efficient 

business to make our 
lives easier, it has 

simultaneously and unknowingly 
given us the opportunity to 
become more connected.

Last year, before I had the 

luxury of my 2003 Acura on 
campus, Uber-ing to the Detroit 
Metro Airport was frequent. 
During one of the many 35-minute 
trips to the airport, I had a 
conversation I’d never forget. He 
was a young, middle-aged Iraqi 
immigrant from Baghdad. What 
began with the usual “where 
are you from” question turned 
into him sharing his experience 
living in Baghdad in 2003 amid a 
tumultuous war.

Ironically, earlier that week I 

had been learning about post-9/11 
America and the Iraq invasion of 
2003 in my “20th Century Wars” 
lecture. Our conversation about 
his experience living and leaving 
a war-torn state was unnerving. 
Needless to say, 35 minutes was 
not a long time, but it was enough 
time. Enough to make me think, 
truly think, in a way I couldn’t by 
sitting in a lecture hall.

I have learned more in these 

short minutes, these brief journeys 
with strangers, than you would 
believe. It has made me open-
minded and empathetic and altered 
my perspective on issues. Now, this 
isn’t to say every experience has 
been like this, no. But this type of 
dialogue between two people who 
lead completely different lives is 
important. Now I make an effort to 

have a conversation with my Uber 
drivers. Some don’t go anywhere, 
and some go everywhere. The 
notes section on my iPhone is 
filled with leftovers from my 
Uber conversations — from song 
recommendations 
to 
column 

ideas, each a tid-bit of an exchange 
with 
a 
stranger. 
Sometimes 

the 
conversations 
are 
funny, 

sometimes they are non-existent 
and sometimes they change you.

You may think I’m glorifying 

Uber, which, at its core, is a 
business venture aiming to make 
money. But it’s not the Uber 
aspect that’s important; rather, 
it’s the idea of talking to people 
outside of our bubbles, outside of 
our networks, who are different 
and who are similar. Everyone 
has a story. But understanding 
someone 
else’s 
experience, 

listening and reaching out to their 
stories can create empathy and 
change 
perspectives. 
Starting 

conversations, 
especially 
the 

unlikely ones, can be the pins that 
burst the comfortable Michigan 
bubbles we live in. And that is 
more important now than ever.

Certain words have been used 

more and more these days, not 
just nationally, but on our own 
campus as well — xenophobia, 
diversity, racism, inclusion, etc. 
Today’s political climate has 
been doused in assumptions, 
judgement and a basic lack of 
understanding of those around us. 
News headlines and rhetoric from 
certain politicians and groups 
show a polarizing atmosphere 
where being different is no 
longer met with acceptance but 
wariness and fear. But, much of 
this polarization is in our hands. 
Understanding someone’s point 
of view, listening to an experience 
that is not your own and having 
unlikely conversations in unlikely 
places (like the back of an Uber) 
is what can start to bridge gaps. 
Talk to people, listen to people — 
it makes all the difference.

I

n my elementary computer 
programming 
class, 
I 

watched a lecture led by a 

female undergraduate computer 
science student about implicit 
gender bias. Looking back on it, I 
think it is a real shame 
that Bill O’Reilly and 
Vice President Mike 
Pence didn’t get to see 
it too. I’m not a fan of 
either one of them, but 
I could put my feelings 
aside if it meant that 
they 
could 
finally 

learn 
something 

about women.

Good 
old 
Bill 

O’Reilly! Back at it 
again, saying something he will 
later regret. During an episode 
of “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday, 
instead of going on a tirade about 
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters’s (D–
Calif.) known disapproval of 
Trump, or liberals in general, he 
shifted his focus to an unexpected 
topic: Waters’s hair. Poor O’Reilly 
couldn’t focus on what she said 
because he “was looking at the 
James Brown wig.”

Politics can be a heavy subject 

and every once in a while we need 
some comic relief, but O’Reilly’s 
comments weren’t funny, and they 
weren’t even original. He’s just 
putting his own spin on the “ape 
in heels” insult lobbed at Michelle 
Obama, copying what trolls did 
in 2012 to Gabby Douglas, and 
what Giuliana Rancic did in 
2015 when she said Zendaya’s 
dreadlocks made it likely the 
pop star smelled like weed. On 
the few occasions we see Black 
women in positions of power 
and influence, let’s not follow 
the example set by people like 
O’Reilly and Rancic of reducing 
these women to stereotypes. 
Instead of making comments 
that blend racism and sexism 
into one awful little package, 

let’s have conversations that are 
meaningful, conversations that 
focus on the achievements of 
these women and how to give 
underrepresented groups a seat at 
the table.

But no one can be 

surprised by O’Reilly’s 
comments — they just 
verbalize what many 
already know: Racism 
and 
discrimination 

come 
in 
many 

different forms, from 
obvious 
signs 
like 

the Confederate flag 
to snide comments 
passed off as a “jest” 
in 
O’Reilly’s 
case. 
 

Despite the work these women 
do, they are still often evaluated 
in terms of their looks. These 
comments may not seem like a big 
deal to many, but our language 
when referring to women reflects 
the values of our society. If we 
only focus on how women look, 
then we aren’t placing value on 
their ideas, intelligence and other 
important characteristics. There’s 
no way we can effectively solve 
the problems around us if, instead 
of being invited to contribute to 
discussions of politics, business 
and science, half of the population 
is being rated on their looks.

O’Reilly “just couldn’t get by 

it.” Well you better “get by it,” 
Mr. O’Reilly. Maybe you forgot 
but you’re not the host of a 
beauty pageant. Rep. Waters is 
not walking down a runway in 
a sparkly dress so that you can 
judge her — she has more pressing 
concerns than how her hair looks 
and what your opinion about it is. 
She’s “going to stay on the issues” 
and her hair isn’t one of them.

Pence has a similar problem. 

According to The Washington 
Post, Pence states that he, “never 
eats alone with a woman other 
than his wife and that he won’t 

attend events featuring alcohol 
without her by his side, either.” 
This may seem like a sweet 
gesture, but he didn’t sit and stop 
to think how unprofessional it is 
and what the implications of this 
patronizing practice can be. I’m 
sure many of his employees are 
dying to get any chance to speak 
with him one-on-one, and his 
acts clearly favor men. His male 
employees have the opportunity 
to communicate with him and 
work with him during a meal, but 
this is not extended to his female 
employees. Also, this practice 
gives me the sense that he thinks 
meeting a woman — besides 
his wife — in these settings is 
scandalous because women are 
dangerous seductresses.

Both of these situations are 

attempts to shut women out of 
positions of power. Through 
childish insults, avoiding their 
presence in Pence’s case and 
other strategies, women are being 
silenced in the workplace and in 
society as a whole.

In case O’Reilly and Pence 

didn’t get the hint from Rep. 
Waters, this will not fly. Like 
Waters, 
women 
“cannot 
be 

intimidated” and “cannot be 
undermined.” They are also more 
than their appearance and not 
something to be pushed aside 
to make room for men. I know 
O’Reilly and Pence probably have 
a hard time accepting this and 
retiring their archaic ideas, but 
they’re going to need to get over 
it. These attitudes won’t go away 
overnight, but if O’Reilly, Pence 
and all of us make a conscious 
effort to question why we think 
the way we do, we won’t have 
to hear or deal with so much 
stereotypical nonsense.

DULIN


I just finished devouring 

“S-Town,” a new podcast from 
Serial and This American Life. 
I expected the story to follow 
in the true-crime footsteps 
of its predecessors and, for 
the first few installments at 
least, that appeared to be the 
direction it was heading. Lured 
by the promise of a small town 
whodunit, journalist Brian Reed 
falls instead into the life of John 
B. McLemore, a contradictorily 
misanthropic and charismatic 
horologist. 
The 
product 
is, 

without 
spoiling 
anything, 

much more compelling that 
any small town / true crime / 
anything I’ve consumed in a 
long time.

It made me think about where 

I come from. If you had asked me 
in high school, I would have told 
you I was living in an S-town 
(short for Shit Town, the name 
McLemore gives his hometown 
of Woodstock, Alabama).

But now I love it. In a very 

un-pop punk (or maybe very 
pop punk, I’m no expert, ask 
Dom Polsinelli) turn of fate 
that my mom has only been 
predicting since the hatred 
began, I feel deeply nostalgic for 
my hometown. At first I wasn’t 
exactly sure how I got here, 
to this weird state of pseudo-
heartsickness for a place I’d 
hated with all the angst of my 
adolescence.

I grew up in Austin, Texas, 

the very blue capital of a very 
red state that I loved to hate. 
And, while Austin has grown 
up quite a bit in the years since I 
left it, the LA-expats gentrifying 
the East Side or the 10 new 
buildings on the skyline aren’t 
why I’ve grown nostalgic for it.

I’ve fallen in love with my 

hometown by watching movies 
in, around and about it.

The first time I registered 

my 
hometown 
on 
screen 

was in “Whip It!” the Drew 
Barrymore / Ellen Page movie 
about 
roller 
derby 
girls. 
I 

rented it on iTunes to watch on 
my tiny iPod Nano screen on 

an airplane because it was in 
my Genius recommendations 
(that sentence really captures a 
moment in technological time). 
And, despite watching on a 
screen the size of a thumbnail, 
I was struck when Ellen Page 
got off the bus in front of Lucy 
in Disguise. Not only was it 
Austin, it was my Austin, a part 
of my hometown that I could 
recognize in a moment.

But 
the 
real 
king 
of 

Austin movies is, of course, 
Linklater. In Austin, “Dazed & 

Confused” has this odd sort of 
cultural currency whereby it’s 
everyone’s favorite movie and 
still impossibly cool.

Maybe because of my age 

or maybe because of the type 
of quiet, artistic kid I was 
growing up, I’ve always been 
partial to “Boyhood.” And in the 
years since it came out — right 
around the same time I put my 
hometown in my rearview — 
I’ve come back to it again and 
again. And that has to mean 
something. 
“Boyhood” 
isn’t 

anyone’s bingey Netflix go-to.

The facts of my life and 

Mason’s 
in 
“Boyhood” 
are 

more dissimilar than they are 
alike. Cosmically, I had it much 
easier: consistent father figure, 
no abusive stepparents. But 
emotionally, I see a lot of myself 
in him. I can recognize the 
sort of detachment that comes 
with growing into shyness and 
introspection.

Little things overlap — we’re 

almost the same age, we both 
discovered a love of art in 
high school, we both went to 
the “Harry Potter” midnight 
releases (at the same bookstore 
nonetheless), camped in Big 

Bend.

But what really gets me, what 

gets me every single time, is 
that scene in “Boyhood” in the 
bowling alley. Because that’s my 
bowling alley. That’s Dart Bowl. 
It’s a space I inhabited long 
before I saw it on the screen. 
I’ve eaten the enchiladas and 
rolled my eyes over not being 
allowed to get bumpers in that 
same physical space. I went 
there with my middle school 
gym class and for my brother’s 
birthday parties. Each time I see 
it I get this pang in my heart, a 
little gasp of recognition. And 
I’ve not completely figured out 
why, even now, I get emotional 
thinking about a bowling alley 
in North Austin.

It’s 
the 
space 
and 
the 

recognition of space that makes 
me feel the most nostalgic, even 
when the facts of our lives line 
up — like when I went to an 
Astros game for my birthday 
— seeing a physical space I’ve 
spent time in is more powerful. 
When Mason and his father go 
camping in Perdernales State 
Park, the shrubby cedar trees 
and clay creek beds look like 
home. The natural space makes 
me feel heartsick for the creek 
behind my own house.

And I feel proud in an odd 

way when I see the landscape 
of my childhood on screen. 
Movies like “Boyhood” give 
me the strange opportunity to 
see the details of my own life 
through someone else’s eyes. 
In that way, “Boyhood” feels 
like my memories, but it doesn’t 
exactly look like them. That 
level of detachment gives me 
the distance, which, in addition 
of my current physical distance, 
to learn to love the place I’d 
dedicated my teen years to 
hating.

And so, I wonder how the 

people of Woodstock, Alabama 
that listened to “S-Town” feel 
about their hometown after 
having someone else — an 
outsider — tell them a version of 
its story.

Local Natives’s Royal Oak 
show nostalgic, energetic

LOMA VISTA

Almost four years ago, I 

listened to Local Natives for the 
first time. After having spent the 
entire day lounging at my family’s 
timeshare on Lake Michigan, 
Spotify’s radio feature led me to 
“Airplanes,” “Who Knows Who 
Cares” and “Wide Eyes,” songs to 
which I would watch the sun set 
many times that summer. After 
chronicling the most relaxing 
summer in my personal history, 
they returned two years later as 
the soundtrack to long drives to 
and from club soccer practice. 
The 
perfect 
soundtrack 
for 

springtime, 
intricately 
woven 

harmonies always high in either 
energy or emotion — oftentimes 
both. I remember one drive in 
particular after an especially 
difficult 
practice, 
which 

culminated in diving into Reeds 
Lake with a teammate and still-
close friend in a moment that 
was complemented perfectly by 
the youthful exuberance of Local 
Natives.

Years after having cemented 

a firm love for Gorilla Manor, the 
band’s debut, and Hummingbird, 
their more emotionally reflective 
second album, listening to lead 
single “Past Lives” in a friend’s 
screened-in porch during a humid 
July night was cathartic in more 
ways than one.

On Friday, March 31, at Royal 

Oak Music Theater, the opening 
notes of “Past Lives” brought all 
of those memories back to life as 
guitarist-vocalist Taylor Rice’s 
voice cuts through the gleeful 
anticipation of the room, almost 
as visible as the over-the-top 
fog pouring from the stage. The 
audience visibly loosens up over 
the course of the song, and after 
its close, the band launches into 
Gorilla 
Manor 
classic 
“Wide 

Eyes,” delivering on all of the 
vigor 
of 
the 
studio-recorded 

version and then some.

Although 
Rice 
announces 

that the band will be playing a 
lot of new material, four of the 
first six songs are from their first 

two albums — thankfully for 
anyone who found Sunlit Youth 
an unnecessary turn toward the 
indie-pop mainstream. “Villainy” 
follows “Wide Eyes,” and after 
is the devastating “You & I,” a 
cornerstone 
of 
Hummingbird 

with its soaring-yet-sorrowful 
nature. The band plays the heavily 
percussive “Wooly Mammoth” 
and “Airplanes,” a homage to 
multi-instrumentalist-vocalist 
Kelcey Ayer’s grandfather, before 
stopping to offer some between-
songs banter.

Rice takes a moment to ask, once 

again, how everyone is doing, and 
then asks whether the audience 
is familiar with the feeling of 
instantaneously falling in love 
with a stranger, someone seen 
just for a moment on the subway 
and then gone forever. By the time 
he has finished the sentiment 
feels overwrought, but its core 
is still relatable. This is what the 
next song, “Jellyfish,” is based 
on, says Rice. Here, the musical 
performance 
gains 
another 

dimension, the screen behind the 
band pulsating in different hues of 
blue and green, almost emulating 
an actual jellyfish, rendering into 
hyperactive silhouettes the five 
men of local natives.

Next are “Heavy Feet” and 

Sunlit Youth highlight “Coins,” 
followed by the band’s most recent 
track, “I Saw You Close Your 
Eyes” — the song was originally 
made available only to those who 
were willing to literally close 
their eyes. Laurel, frontwoman of 
opener Little Scream, then joins 
the band for duet “Dark Days,” 
an unremarkable track which has 
for some reason or another been 
chosen as perhaps the best off of 
Sunlit Youth by fans, according 
to Spotify streaming and iTunes 
purchasing data. Here, Rice stops 
to thank everyone for coming and 
reminds us that, thanks to their 
partnership with Plus 1, $1 from 
every ticket purchase will go 
toward organizations that work to 
prevent sexual assault.

After “Ceilings,” the band 

plays — for the first time live 
— their cover of “Ultralight 
Beam,” which is overwhelmingly 

more impressive in person than 
via 
Spotify, 
with 
harmonies 

seemingly designed solely to coax 
out goosebumps. Now, all but 
Rice and Ayer walk offstage. Ayer 
announces that this next one is 
particularly special to him, and 
that he wants to make it special for 
us, before beginning “Columbia,” 
a song written in the memory 
of his mother. Unfortunately, a 
large part of the audience doesn’t 
seem to care — “this is the cost 
of breaking into the popular 
mainstream,” I tell myself — but 
the song builds, and about two 
minutes in, the other three walk 
on. The sound becomes larger; it 
swells and breaks and there is no 
better way to capture nostalgia, 
longing, loving, and the sorrow of 
leaving in four minutes.

The 
band 
then 
turns 

its 
mourning 
outward, 

acknowledging the dire state of 
national affairs — “a lot of people 
have been fucked over in the past 
six months,” says Rice — before 
playing “Fountain of Youth,” a 
cheesy, overly indulgent ode to 
the power of youth. The song itself 
feels too performative to hold 
weight, but one line in particular 
— “I have waited so long, Mrs. 
President” — sits funny. The 
originally inspirational message 
of the feels soured considerably 
since September.

Perhaps 
intentionally, 
the 

band then turns back the clock to 
2009. The first show they played 
in Detroit, and the first time they 
played this next song live, they 
played in a room below freezing 
“to five people.” “If you know 
any of the words, please sing 
along,” says Rice. “Who Knows 
Who Cares” follows, fittingly, 
and the band walks off for an 
unconvincing couple of minutes 
before returning for “Masters” 
and “Sun Hands,” during which 
Rice floats himself out over the 
crowd, surfing for a couple of 
minutes before breaking it down 
onstage. In semi-classic fashion, 
Ayer, after noticing that his 
guitar’s neck had broken during 
the song, throws it down onto the 
stage, its pieces littering as the 
band exits.

‘Boyhood’ and learning to 

love my hometown

FILM COLUMN

IFC

Want to know the worst type 

of television? Not bad television, 
although that’s a solid guess. No, 
forgettable television is the worst. 
Forgettable television is similar to 
boring television, but it’s more than 
that — it’s those series that so utterly 
fail to distinguish themselves that, 
once an episode ends, it retreats 
to the back of our consciousness. 
This is precisely the sort of show 
that “Nobodies,” TV Land’s newest 
comedic foray, proves to be, leaving 
nothing in the way of a lasting 
impression due to its poor writing 
and easily replaceable cast of actual 
nobodies.

Immediately 
upon 
watching 

“Nobodies,” the show’s deficiencies 
are evident with its anonymous 
cast. As the series’ title indicates, 
the stars of “Nobodies” are, in 
fact, nobodies — they’re mainly 

screenwriters whose little acting 
experience has come through 
minor roles or parts as voice actors. 
The cast’s inexperience is apparent 
as they struggle to develop any 
chemistry. Playing fictionalized 
versions 
of 
themselves, 
Larry 

Dorf (“The Looney Tunes Show”), 
Hugh Davidson (“Mike Tyson 
Mysteries”) and Rachel Ramras 
(“Frank TV”) all fail to bring much 
of anything to their characters or 
consistently generate laughs. While 
its core characters do not deliver, 
“Nobodies” 
benefits 
from 
an 

excellent cameo by Jason Bateman 
(“Arrested Development”), who 
is hilarious in his all-too-brief 
appearance as himself. Although 
strong 
in 
his 
role, 
Bateman 

ultimately receives too little screen-
time to make up for the rest of the 
cast’s weaknesses.

Although the cast of “Nobodies” 

doesn’t do the series any favors, 
the actors aren’t given much to 
work with due to the show’s weak 

premise and lack of a strong focus. 
In “Nobodies,” Davidson, Dorf 
and Ramras meet with Paramount 
Pictures about picking up their 
script, “Mr. First Lady,” as a feature 
film. Since they aren’t known in 
Hollywood, they are forced to try 
and convince Bateman and comedic 
icon Melissa McCarthy (“Spy”) to 
star in the movie. It’s not a terrible 
concept in theory, but it’s a niche 
type of story that leaves “Nobodies” 
with limited room for growth. The 
series also seems to lose sight of this 
basic plotline, as scenes throughout 
the pilot frequently focusing more 
on Davidson, Dorf and Ramras’s 
personal lives rather than their 
efforts to make “Mr. First Lady” 
come to the big screen. While 
these scenes do offer an interesting 
perspective into their lives, they 
often meander and run a few 
minutes too long.

“Nobodies” is further dragged 

down by its writing, which often 
spoon-feeds viewers pieces of the 

plot. The series appears resigned 
to telling audiences much of its 
plot points rather than showing 
them, detracting from the show’s 
overall quality. In an especially 
obvious example of this, one 
scene features Dorf, Ramras and 
Davidson debating the future of 
“Mr. First Lady,” with Ramras 
stating, “I can’t quit because I’m 
a single mom with a child.” Such a 
bland line just dumps plot details on 
viewers, leading them to question 
why “Nobodies” doesn’t attempt to 

depict Ramras’s child or otherwise 
convey that Ramras is a single 
mother using less direct phrasing.

While 
“Nobodies” 
fails 
to 

consistently produce laughs, the 
show does succeed when relying on 
raunchier humor. When Davidson, 
Dorf and Ramras allow their less 
family-friendly styles of humor 
to emerge, the result is actually 
pretty funny. For example, in one 
no-holds-barred 
scene, 
Ramras 

argues with Dorf and Davidson 
about how to talk to McCarthy’s 

husband about their film, and 
Ramras loudly declares, “He’ll feel 
gangbanged… 
gangbanged, 
like 

he’s ganged up on.” Scenes like 
these should become the norm for 
“Nobodies” if it aspires to prove 
itself something other than a 
complete flop.

Overall, “Nobodies” is a dud that 

doesn’t offer any memorable bits of 
humor or semblance of a succinct, 
engaging 
storyline, 
making 
it 

utterly forgettable television at its 
finest.

There are movies so bad they 

are good, then there 
are movies that are 
just bad. “Wilson,” 
directed by Craig 
Johnson 
(“The 

Skeleton 
Twins”) 

and 
written 
by 

Daniel 
Clowes 

(“Art 
School 
Confidential”) 

based off his own graphic 
novel, 
“Wilson” 
is 
almost 

unwatchable.

Woody 
Harrelson 
(“The 

Edge of Seventeen”) stars as 
Wilson, a socially awkward 
man with a heart of gold. 
Harrelson gives it his all, 
that much must be said. It’s 
just a shame the character 
he portrays is so incredibly 
unlikeable that it’s hard to care 
about him or root for him at any 
step along the way. The plot 
follows Wilson as he attempts 
to reconnect with his drug-
using ex-wife and the daughter 
said wife gave up for adoption 
17 years ago. It’s weird. It’s also 
just not entertaining.

The film moves at a glacial 

pace. 
It 
takes 
forever 
for 

the story to get moving, and 
the overall plot is just so 
hackneyed and ridiculous that 
I spent almost the entire movie 

wishing it were over. Ninety 
minutes too long, “Wilson” 
never manages to rise above it’s 
schlocky writing and one-note 
characters. If the graphic novel 

has 
anything 

going 
for 
it, 

none of it can 
be found in the 
translation 
to 

the big screen.

Movies like 

“Wilson” 
are 

movies that need to stop being 
made. Today, there’s a whole 
genre of film that follows this 
idea that “weird realism” is 
a good way to connect with 
audiences. It’s characters are 
supposed to be more “real” 
because they are so unlikeable 
and 
it’s 
situations 
portray 

people who only make the 
wrong decisions because that’s 
what “real” life is like. No, it’s 
not. A particularly disturbing 
element of “Wilson” is the 
way the film treats adoption. 
The Wilson character never 
seems to understand that in 
all relevant and emotional 
ways, the daughter his wife 
gave up is not his daughter. 
The movie treats the girl’s 
adoptive parents as villains, 
when all they do is ask that a 
creepy man stop stalking and 
kidnapping 
their 
daughter. 

Wilson eventually gets thrown 
in jail and then gets together 

with his dog-sitter, who is at 
least twenty years his younger.

All this random nonsense 

adds up to a whole lot of 
nothing. No amount of wacky 
shenanigans can make up for 

uninteresting characters and 
cringeworthy dialogue. These 
strange 
exploits 
might’ve 

worked well as a comic strip, 
but there’s no indication of 
that here, nor is there any 
indication of what it was about 
the comic that made anyone 
on earth think it would make a 
good movie.

BOOK REVIEW
‘The Barrowfields’ is a 
deeply heartfelt debut

A 
heartbreaking 
love 

letter to literature, loss and 
life changing choices, “The 
Barrowfields” by Philip Lewis 
is an absolutely gorgeous debut 
novel. Opening its pages is like 
looking 
directly 

into 
the 
mind 

of 
the 
novel’s 

protagonist, 
Henry 
Asther, 

and it reads as an 
intimate tale of 
sorrow, addiction 
and growing up.

“The 

Barrowfields” 
is 
set 
in 

fictional Old Buckram, North 
Carolina — a place filled with 
crippling poverty that is slow 
to modernize. It is there, in a 
ghostly skeleton of a mansion 
high on a hill, that Henry Aster 
is raised by an aloof father, 
who has a massive literary 
ambitions and a worsening 
drinking habit, and a quiet, yet 
supportive, mother. Henry is in 
awe of his father’s ambitions; 
his father works as a lawyer 

during the day, but writes and 
plays piano in his gigantic 
library all night. In his young 
adulthood, Henry begins to 
take after his father. When 
tragedy strikes, leaving Henry, 
his mother and young sister 
alone, he departs for college 
and resolves to never return 
home. He leaves the house 
on the hill and his mother 
and young sister to fend for 
themselves.

Through 
a 
new 
and 

shocking journey in the real 
world, 
Henry 
falls 
deeply 

and perplexingly in love. The 
woman, ironically named Story, 
brings her own baggage to 
their relationship. Eventually, 
after graduate school, Henry 
finds himself traveling back 
to his childhood home, which 
stands unoccupied on the hill, 

and in attempts 
to 
resolve 
his 

inner 
demons, 

grapples with his 
feelings for Story 
and find himself. 
Through inspired 
and 
shrewd 

prose, 
Lewis 

tells the story of 

the challenging and thought 
provoking life of Henry Aster.

Although this is Lewis’s first 

novel, one would never guess 
that he is new to the world of 
authorship. He has close ties 
to the narrative and setting of 
his fictional tale, as he is from 
a mountainous North Carolina 
town. 
He 
also 
practices 

law, collects rare books and 
studies language much like 
the fictional Henry Aster and 
his father. It is obvious he 
has many personal ties to his 
first novel — the passion and 
realism radiating off the pages 
is unparalleled to any recent 
realistic fiction piece.

“The 
Barrowfields” 
is 

clever, with a hint of nostalgia 
and plenty of intellect. It 
contains a great deal of literary 
references, 
ranging 
from 

Poe to Wolfe, which provide 
lovely metaphors and layers 
of additional meaning to the 
story. 
The 
narrative 
prose 

is 
precise 
and 
calculated, 

creating a beautiful tone for 
the reader that makes the piece 
captivating and impossible to 
put down.

The most striking part of the 

novel is its deep authenticity. 
It’s rare to pick up a piece of 
modern realist literature that 
feels like it is surrounding 
you. It was nearly impossible 

to separate my reality from 
the reality of the book, and 
that is important in regards 
to its themes and messages. 
The portrayal of the hope and 
courage we are forced to adopt 
in the face of grief and sorrow 
is 
incredibly 
genuine. 
It’s 

refreshing to read something 
that has such a strong sense of 
truth.

The 
world 
that 
Philip 

Lewis creates in the “The 
Barrowfields” is vivid and 
honest. I urge any lover of 
literature and flowing prose 
who needs a story of hope 
and courage to read it. I look 
forward to whatever Lewis 
has in store for readers next; I 
predict a great deal of success 
with his debut piece. It is the 
type of novel that just thinking 
about makes me wish I could 
unread it’s every page just so I 
could read them all again.

In search of validation

T

he Michigan softball 
team left the John 
Cropp Classic in 

Lexington, Ky. teetering on 
the brink of disaster. 

Following a swift 5-1 defeat 

to No. 19 Kentucky on March 
12, its record dropped to 14-7-
1 — the worst 22-game start 
since 2006.

“We’re not playing the game 

of softball,” said Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins after 
that game. “Just play the 
game of softball, not who do 
you play, not who’s ranked, 
not who’s supposed to win. 
You’re just supposed to play 
the game, and we are very 
inconsistent in that category.”

Its 2-6-1 record against 

ranked opponents — averaging 
just two runs per game in 
those nine matchups — raised 
serious concerns about an 
unproven lineup, and whether 
it would ever find its form 
against the type of quality it 
would face.

The Wolverines were 

reeling, in search of answers 
to major questions on both 
sides of the ball. 

Since then, Michigan has 

won 12 in a row, and done so 
in a fashion that hints at some 
semblance of sustainability. 

Since allowing five runs 

to Kentucky, senior right-
hander Megan Betsa has not 
allowed a run and thrown two 
no-hitters. With a changed 
approach aimed at attacking 
hitters, Betsa has blossomed 
into the dominant ace who had 
been missing at the beginning 
of the year. In the 48-inning 
span, she walked just 11 
batters after walking 31 in her 
first 77.1 innings this season. 

In turn, Betsa became 

the senior leader — in 
performance and demeanor 
— that Hutchins believes has 
been coming for awhile now.

“I really think her mental 

game is consistent. It’s been 
really consistent during this 
period,” Hutchins said. “She’s 
just trusting what she’s doing 
is good enough. She really sets 
a great example and she sets 
a good tone for us, and this 
is sometimes when we’re not 
offensive.

“She’s really been the best 

I’ve seen her in her career.”

The Wolverines’ lineup has 

seemingly turned a corner, 
as well. Since the Kentucky 
game, Michigan has averaged 
6.75 runs per game, with 
contributions coming from a 
plethora of sources. 

Junior infielder Amanda 

Vargas has thrived in her 
newfound role in the three 
spot in the order. Second 
baseman Faith Canfield 
has continued her breakout 
sophomore campaign, 
boasting a .356 average, and 
tied for the team lead with 
five home runs. And the 
two slap hitters — senior 
shortstop Abby Ramirez and 
sophomore outfielder Natalie 
Peters — have combined for 
70 hits on the season, adding 
necessary depth to a lineup 
that had become all-too reliant 
on senior centerfielder Kelly 
Christner.

With the rotation becoming 

a dominant force and the 
lineup starting to solidify, the 
12-game win streak seems a 
tell-tale sign of a team that has 
found its groove.

But this weekend we find 

out if that change is real.

The six opponents the 

Wolverines have faced since 
that tournament in Kentucky 
have an average RPI of 127, 
and five of the six sport 
records below .500. 

They did what they were 

supposed to do at Alumni Field 
— beat up on inferior teams 
during its long homestretch.

This weekend in 

Columbus, Michigan runs 
into an offensive buzzsaw, 
an unfamiliar contender that 
is quietly putting the Big 
Ten on notice. Coming off 

its first NCAA tournament 
appearance since 2010, No. 
25 Ohio State is emerging 
as a serious contender in 
the uncharacteristically 
competitive Big Ten. 

The Buckeyes come into the 

series surging — their only loss 
in their last 16 games coming 
at the hands of No. 5 Auburn. 
Its offense has posted 84 runs 
in its last seven games, with 
its top-three home run hitters 
— Lilli Piper, Alex Bayne and 
Emily Clark — totaling more 
home runs (25) than the entire 
Michigan team (24). 

And they will be motivated. 

In a matchup that signifies a 
rivalry in many other sports, 
Ohio State has dropped 
18-straight matchups to the 
Wolverines, dating back to 
2010.

It’s time to find out whether 

Betsa can mow through a top-
caliber lineup the way she did 
the Big Ten bottom-dwellers.

It’s time to find out whether 

junior right-hander Tera 
Blanco’s “pitch-to-contact” 
style will hold against a team 
with 37 home runs on the 
season.

And, most importantly, 

it’s time to see whether 
Michigan’s offense — which 
has shown a pulse against the 
likes of Eastern Michigan, 
Penn State and Northwestern 
— can replicate its production 
when faced with adversity on 
the road, against an array of 
quality pitching.

Without No. 7 Minnesota 

on the schedule until, 
presumably, the Big Ten 
Tournament, the Wolverines 
will use road visits to Ohio 
State and Wisconsin as their 
major measuring sticks.

On Friday, the Wolverines 

will head to Columbus to find 
out who they are.

On Sunday, they will come 

home a different team, for 
better or worse.

Defensive line in search of depth

To say the bar is high would be 

an understatement. 

For the Michigan football team’s 

new defensive line, that bar might 
as well be scratching the surface of 
the moon.

In 2016, there weren’t many 

questions 
to 
be 
answered. 

Defensive 
line 
coach 
Greg 

Mattison had three fifth-year 
seniors and one true senior at his 
disposal in Chris Wormley, Ryan 
Glasgow, Matthew Godin and Taco 
Charlton, with a plethora of talent 
surrounding them.

Now, after their departures, 

things aren’t that simple.

But even though the personnel 

has changed, Mattison’s philosophy, 
as always, has remained the same. 
The seventh-year coach, and the 
Wolverines’ staff as a whole, has 
always been steadfast in the belief 
that rotations on the defensive front 
are necessary.

“We always talk about (how) you 

earn the right to rotate,” Mattison 
said. “Two things can happen — if 
you don’t earn the right to rotate, 
now you’ve got four guys playing 
the whole time and they’re never 
gonna play as good as if you have 
guys to rotate for them.

“That’s a big thing for us, that 

some of the guys behind them have 
got to close that gap fast.”

It’s easy to see why — injuries 

are part of the territory that come 
with playing in the trenches. In 
2015, Bryan Mone missed his 
entire sophomore season after 
sustaining a leg injury in fall camp. 
Last season, Charlton missed two 
games against Central Florida and 
Colorado, while Maurice Hurst 
missed Michigan’s opener against 
Hawaii.

As the focus shifts to the 

Wolverines’ next season opener, 
establishing that rotation has 
become an even more pressing 
issue.

Mattison is already optimistic 

about the first unit, one that 
will likely feature Hurst, Mone, 
sophomore Rashan Gary and 
senior 
Chase 
Winovich. 
Last 

season, those four were staples 
in the second unit, accumulating 
valuable snaps and racking up a 

combined 27 tackles for loss and 
10.5 sacks.

“(They’re) 
very 
important, 

because unlike them last year — 
when they were right there behind 
that first group — now they’re 
there as a group of guys that have 
played,” Mattison said. “There’s 
a little bigger gap, so they have to 
always show the right way to do it. 
It can’t be, ‘Now that’s OK.’

“It’s gotta be right, it’s gotta be 

championship-type effort, it’s gotta 
be championship technique. … The 
spotlight is on them a little bit more 
because there’s a real young group 
behind them.”

In that same young group, 

Michigan finds the bulk of its 
unknowns heading into the 2017 
season.

Mattison praised sophomore 

defensive end Carlo Kemp and 
freshman defensive end Donovan 
Jeter for their work in spring 
practices thus far, while also giving 
credit to Lawrence Marshall, Ron 
Johnson, Carl Myers and Michael 
Dwumfour at tackle.

Still, none among them have 

tallied significant minutes, and 
while — according to Mattison 
— the talent has been on display, 
he has yet to see it on a consistent 
basis.

“I think the biggest thing in the 

depth is that these guys behind 
them have to move faster toward 
that level than the last group did,” 
Mattison said. “The last group had 
been right on that verge, and they 
were that.

“This group hasn’t been in 

the playing time — they’ve been 
out redshirted or they’ve been 
freshmen — so they haven’t really 
been on that field, so they’ve got to 
take a bigger step to get up to that 
level, to be able to rotate.”

Regardless, the fact remains 

that the days of Wormley, Glasgow, 
Godin and Charlton are growing 
farther in the rearview mirror by 
the day. Fortunately, for a team 
searching to establish depth in the 
coming months, their impact may 
last a little longer.

“I don’t know if they’ll ever 

appreciate as much as they should 
of what they had when they had 
Glasgow, Godin, Wormley and 
Charlton, in that room, leading that 
room,” Mattison said. “That was a 
special group. For them to be part 
of that kind of gives them that thing 
that, ‘We wanna be that way too.’

“OK, well now you’ve got to 

work to be that way. That’s kind 
of the bar now, that you want to be 
like they were and play like they 
did, and that’s what we’re shooting 
for.”

Wolverines claw back to beat Notre Dame

It didn’t take long for the No. 

18 Michigan baseball team to 
fall back into comeback mode in 
Tuesday night’s game against 
Notre Dame. In the first inning, 
Fighting 
Irish 
centerfielder 

Matt Vierling skyrocketed a 
ball over the left-field wall at 
Ray Fisher 
Stadium 
to 
give 

Notre 
Dame a three-run lead.

Still, the Wolverines (4-2 Big 

Ten, 23-6 overall) managed to 
stave off Notre Dame (4-8 ACC, 
10-17 overall) in the showdown 
thanks to four runs in the third, 
fourth, fifth and sixth innings 
that led to a 4-3 victory.

“They know they’re going 

to come back, I know they’re 
going to come back,” said 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich. 
“It’s just part of our deal, we 
just come back.”

After the scorching start by 

the Fighting Irish, Notre Dame 
kept the pressure on junior 
right-hander 
Alec 
Rennard, 

who was on the mound for the 
Wolverines.

While the Fighting Irish’s 

bats were hot in the first 
inning, they cooled off just as 
quickly. Notre Dame failed to 
score for the remaining of the 
game. 

While the Wolverines were 

hitless going into the third 
inning, 
they 
kept 
getting 

contact and looked poised to 
break out of their scoreless 
drought.

Sophomore 
designated 

hitter Nick Poirier started the 
hitting barrage for Michigan 
in the third inning with a 
single to right field. Following 
him up was Engelmann, who 
immediately singled to left.

“I think offensive baseball 

is contagious,” said sophomore 
right 
fielder 
Jonathan 

Engelmann. “Guys start to 
get hits, other guys feel more 

obliged to do so.”

With 
two 
walks 
from 

sophomore second baseman 
Ako 
Thomas 
and 
senior 

centerfielder 
Johnny 
Slater 

and a sacrifice bunt from senior 
catcher Harrison Wenson, the 
Wolverines cut 
their deficit to 
two.

In the bottom 

of 
the 
fourth 

inning, 
the 

Fighting 
Irish 

pulled 
their 

starting 
left-

hander 
Scott 

Tully, who had 
clearly 
been 

inhibiting 
Michigan’s 
offense. 

“He did a good job mixing 

in off-speed,” Engelmann said. 
“He was a guy you have to set 
your rhythm later for.”

Notre 
Dame’s 
Charlie 

Vorsheck relieved Tully, and 
Engelmann 
immediately 

jumped on him, lofting a ball 
into shallow right field for 
an RBI triple, cutting Notre 
Dame’s lead to only one.

The 

Wolverines 
faced 
another 

scare 
in 
the 

bottom of the 
fifth 
inning, 

as Notre Dame 
managed 
to 

load the bases 
with one out. 
Freshman 
southpaw 
Tommy 
Henry 

entered in the 
middle of the 

inning, though, and forced a 
groundout and a strikeout to 
end the inning.

Michigan finally got the 

equalizer it had been looking 
for in the bottom of the fifth 
inning, when Slater hit a 
sacrifice flyout to left field that 
brought in Thomas — who had 
reached third base after an 
overthrown ball sailed over the 
second baseman.

The core of the Wolverines’ 

offense came from Poirier and 
Engelmann, who, in the bottom 
of the sixth inning, carried 
the team to its first lead of 
the game. Engelmann lined 
a double past the diving first 
baseman to send a sprinting 
Poirier home from first, giving 
Michigan a 4-3 lead. Despite 
Notre Dame multiple chances 
to regain the lead n the eighth 
and ninth innings, the Fighting 
Irish couldn’t execute. 

“It’s 
pivotal,” 
Engelmann 

said. “Coming out with a ‘W’ 
after this and getting a win 
over a great ACC team.”

BASEBALL
Brdar extends current 
hit streak to 15 games

Through the first 29 games 

of the season, a strong case can 
be made that shortstop Michael 
Brdar has been the most valuable 
player for the No. 18 Michigan 
baseball team (4-2 Big Ten, 23-6 
overall).

The senior ranks third on the 

team in home runs with three, 
second in batting average at .325, 
runs with 24, doubles with six 
and slugging percentage at .478. 
He is also first in hits with 38 – 
which ranks fourth in the Big Ten. 
Additionally, Brdar has played 
stellar defense with a .982 fielding 
percentage, 
making a handful 
of web gem plays 
in the field.

Heading into 

Tuesday night’s 
game 
against 

Notre 
Dame 

(4-8 ACC, 10-17 
overall), 
Brdar 

was 
riding 
a 

14-game 
hit 

streak.

In the bottom of the fifth, 

Brdar stepped up to the plate 
for the third time. After fouling 
off several pitches and working 
a 3-2 count, Brdar blasted a line 
drive up the middle for a single, 
extending his hit streak to 15 
games.

During the streak, he has 

recorded 25 hits, helping the 
Wolverines to a 12-3 record.

When asked what has propelled 

his hit streak, Brdar unselfishly 
credited his teammates for getting 
on base and giving him motivation 
to follow suit.

Brdar finished the night 1-for-4 

in Michigan’s 4-3 victory. Despite 
his merits as a batter, Brdar’s 
biggest contributions were with 
his glove.

In the fourth inning, Brdar 

backhanded a one-hopper to 

prevent a hit from Fighting 
Irish leadoff batter Nick Podkul. 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich 
credits the play for stopping a 
Notre Dame rally.

Four innings later, with the 

Wolverines up 4-3, Brdar cut off a 
throw by redshirt sophomore left 
fielder Miles Lewis and threw out 
the game-tying run at the plate.

“It was a tough play because 

it was a short hop and he had 
to make an accurate throw in 
traffic,” Bakich said. “But if there’s 
anyone who you want to have the 
ball (in a pressure situation) it’s 
(Brdar). It was a huge play, it really 
saved the game”

Brdar currently bats third for 

Michigan 
– 
a 

spot 
typically 

designated for a 
team’s best all-
around 
hitter 

– however, he 
didn’t start the 
season near the 
top of the order. 
Throughout the 
first few weeks 
of the season, he 
was 
generally 

penciled in at the sixth or seventh 
spot. However, consistent play at 
the plate moved him all the way to 
the third spot on March 19 against 
Northern Illinois – and he has 
been there ever since. 

In his first year as a Wolverine 

last season, Brdar batted .250 
with 44 hits, one home run and 16 
runs batted-in. Brdar has already 
surpassed that RBI total with 21, 
and is just six hits shy of tying his 
previous total hit mark.

Despite his boost in the lineup 

and his improved play at the plate, 
Brdar’s approach remains the 
same.

“I try to stick to what I do up 

there,” Brdar said. “We try and 
keep the lineup moving with 
quality at-bats the whole game. 
Just trying to do my job each time

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Sophomore running back Chris Evans has taken advantage of the offseason to gain more strength and knowledge.

Evans builds stronger physique 

Chris 
Evans 
strolled 
into 

the lobby of Towsley Family 
Museum, clad in a grey cut-off 
t-shirt and a pair of flip-flops. 
The customary flattop hairstyle 
— a trait which he became known 
for last year — was still there.

What 
was 
different 
was 

Evans’ physique. The sophomore 
running back has made upper-
body gains — significant enough 
that it was hard to believe that 
the 
difference 
between 
his 

weight Tuesday and last season 
was just seven pounds, up from 
205 to 212.

However striking his physical 

difference may have been, it 
probably should not have been 
a surprise. After all, Evans 
simply followed through with a 
plan that he told to many near 
the end of a breakout freshman 
campaign, one that saw him 
average seven yards per carry 
en route to 614 total rushing 
yards.

As the season wound down, 

Evans had said he wanted to 
put on more weight so he could 
run with a more bruising style 
similar to last year’s starter, 
De’Veon 
Smith, 
while 
also 

improving 
his 
pass-blocking 

ability and knowledge of the 
offense’s concepts.

“Basically last year, I was 

just going out there and I had 
one job,” Evans said Tuesday. 
“(Former running backs coach 
Tyrone) Wheatley just made 
sure I had one job, because once 
you get two jobs and you’ve got 
to check this and check that, it 
gets crazy.

“Most of the plays that I ran 

(last year) were like, ‘Okay, run 
to this gap,’ and that’s it. During 
(pass) protection, you have to 
look coast to coast and all that, 
so it’s really hard.”

In short, he wanted to develop 

the traits of a complete back 
— the type of back who would 
earn more than the 10 combined 
carries Evans received against 
Michigan State and Ohio State.

While the jury is still out on 

whether Evans will be able to 
dole out more punishment to 

opposing defenses and whether 
he has a better grasp of the 
offensive scheme, he claims he 
has already seen improvement in 
his pass blocking.

It was also evident in the 

results from Michigan’s Spring 
Combine that he has retained 
the speed, agility and overall 
athleticism 
that 
made 
him 

a home run threat last year, 
earning recognition as the top 
offensive 
performer 
for 
his 

standing within his position 
group.

Evans finished first amongst 

running backs in seven out of 
eight tests, each designed to 
measure athleticism. He had the 
highest vertical, the best shuttle 
times, the farthest broad jump, 
and the fastest 40-yard dash 
time at 4.64 seconds.

While 4.64 is still plenty fast, 

the time may have seemed slow 
to many, especially given Evans’ 
pedigree as a high school track 
star. Plus, he had flashed what 
certainly looked like 4.4 or 4.5 
speed plenty of times last year.

Evans was adamant that — 

even with the weight gain — 
he has maintained his speed, 
mentioning with a slight chuckle 
just when exactly the 4.64 time 
had been recorded — “It was 
6:00 in the morning.”

His physical change has come 

during what could have been 
a tumultuous offseason, given 
that his former position coach 
Wheatley left Michigan for the 
same position with the NFL’s 
Jacksonville Jaguars. Evans and 
Wheatley were close, and still 
are, with the former saying he 
still calls his old mentor nearly 
every other day.

“I talk to him a lot and he just 

tells me his side,” Evans said. 

“We just have long talks and 
stuff. ... I’ll send him clips of 
stuff I couldn’t do last year just 
to be like, ‘Hey coach, I’m getting 
better.’ ”

The Wolverines ended up 

finding an in-house solution for 
Wheatley’s vacancy, moving Jay 
Harbaugh from the tight ends 
to running backs, which eased 
the transition. Evans said the 
younger Harbaugh’s preparation, 
from 
having 
meetings 
and 

slideshows on the first day back, 
“really blew him away”.

And Evans, a speed and 

“finesse” 
back, 
as 
fifth-year 

senior center Patrick Kugler 
described, 
has 
enjoyed 
the 

change 
in 
philosophy 
that 

Harbaugh has brought to the 
position group as well.

“It’s a different perspective 

because Coach Wheatley, he had 
the perspective of a big back and 
I’m not a big back,” Evans said. 
“So the technique and things 
he was teaching me, I really 
couldn’t get all the way because 
I couldn’t relate to them. Coach 
Jay, he didn’t play running back, 
but he’s looking outside in, so he 
gives a different perspective of 
the game.”

It has been quite the eventful 

offseason for Evans, from the 
weight gain to the coaching 
change to the terminology that 
new assistant head coach and 
passing game coordinator Pep 
Hamilton has installed into the 
offense.

What has sustained Evans 

through all of the work and the 
grueling 
four-hour 
practices 

is the knowledge that slowing 
down could result in getting 
passed by any of the other backs 
on the roster.

“All the competition in the 

room just makes you compete 
at a higher level,” Evans said. 
“You have to come to practice 
knowing your stuff, or somebody 
will know more and he’ll expose 
you.

“You’re not gonna be like, ‘Oh, 

I’ve got to make sure I do better 
than him.’ No one’s saying that, 
that’s just in everyone’s head. … 
Having that competition in the 
room is just going to make you go 
that much harder.”

WOMEN’S LACROSSE
With full team effort, 
Michigan tops Niagara

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

lacrosse team (4-9) had no 
shortage of firepower on their 
way to a 20-10 victory over 
Niagara University (4-7) on 
Tuesday. 
In a well-
rounded 
team 
effort, 
the 
Purple 
Eagles 

just couldn’t seem to find 
the answers to anyone in the 
Wolverines’ lineup. 

The first half began with 

four unanswered goals for 
Michigan. Senior midfielder 
Ann Schueler had a standout 
performance as she scored 
two unassisted goals to start 
the game. Ten minutes later, 
senior Natalie Carti ended 
the scoreless drought off an 
assist from senior attacker 
Tess Korten. Korten went on 
to pick up a goal herself just 30 
seconds later. There were still 
about 15 minutes left to play in 
the first half.

Niagara 
began 
to 
build 

momentum 
three 
minutes 

later, 
scoring 
three 

unanswered points, but the 
Purple Eagles faltered shortly 
afterward, and failed to come 
any closer.

Schueler 
responded 

immediately, picking up a goal 
just 15 seconds after Niagara 
had scored.

“They made a push,” said 

Michigan 
coach 
Jennifer 

Ulehla. 
“We 
pushed 
back. 

We pushed back before the 
first half. And that makes a 
difference.”

With 41 seconds remaining 

in the first half, Korten scored 
her second goal. And with just 
two seconds left on the clock, 
freshman Sydney Whitaker 
broke through off an assist 
from Shueler. This put the 

Wolverines up, 7-3, at halftime.

Michigan blew open its lead 

halfway through the second 
half. 
Senior 
attacker 
Jess 

Angerman tallied three of 
her own, and goals also came 
from redshirt junior attacker 
Bianca 
Brueckner, 
junior 

attacker Mae Tarr and senior 
midfielder/attacker 
Lauren 

Olbermann.

Up 
until 
that 
point, 

upperclassmen had dominated 
the play for the Wolverines, but 
with a comfortable lead, Ulehla 
decided to give her younger 
players a chance to compete.

“It was great to be able to 

put in a lot of younger ones, 
freshmen and sophomores,” 
Ulehla said. “It was great to 
showcase our depth. So it was a 
great day for the youth and the 
future of Michigan lacrosse.”

Redshirt freshman attacker 

Adriana Pendino notched a hat 
trick, and freshmen midfielder 
Chandler Kirby and attacker 
Lilly Grass would pick up 
a 
goal 
apiece. 
Sophomore 

Grace Hemmer would also 
contribute a goal to wrap up 
the 20-10 win.

As the team gets ready to 

head into the last three games 
of their tough season, Ulehla 
explained the importance of 
Tuesday’s win.

“It’s good for us from a 

momentum 
standpoint,” 

Ulehla said. “We really did 
really well on the draw. We had 
nine 
draw-controls 
against 

Niagara, which just shows 
consistency. We’re going to 
carry that on into our game 
against (Johns) Hopkins.”

Michigan has just three 

games left to capitalize on 
its momentum, but if they 
continue to succeed as they did 
against the Purple Eagles, they 
might be able to pull together 
a great finish to a difficult 
season.

2016-17 Season in Review: Women’s Basketball 

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team overcame many 
hardships this season, despite 
having 
the 
most 
successful 

year in the program’s history. 
The 
Wolverines 
totaled 
28 

wins, smashing their record for 
victories in a season by six. They 
also finished in third place in the 
Big Ten — their best finish since 
the 2010-11 season.

Regardless 
of 
Michigan’s 

success, the selection committee 
opted to leave the Wolverines 
out of the NCAA Tournament, 
much to the team’s surprise. 
Michigan (11-5 Big Ten, 28-9 
overall), however, responded in 
the best way possible by finishing 
its season with six straight wins 
to claim its first-ever tournament 
championship.

The 
Daily 
recaps 
the 

highlights and lowlights of the 
2016-17 season.

Best 
game: 
WNIT 

Championship — Michigan 89, 
Georgia Tech 79

The most important game also 

happened to be the best game of 
the year. Down six points in the 
final 1:23 of regulation of the 
WNIT championship against the 
Yellow Jackets, the Wolverines 
clawed their way back to an 
improbable victory. Michigan 
can thank junior guard Katelynn 
Flaherty for that, as she hit two 
triples in those final 83 seconds 
to tie the game. It can also thank 
divine intervention, as Georgia 
Tech missed two free throws 
with 0.6 seconds left to send the 
game to overtime.

The Wolverines and Yellow 

Jackets battled back and forth in 
the extra periods, until Michigan 
finally broke away in the third 
overtime to give the Wolverines 
their first banner to hang in 
Crisler Center.

Worst game: Michigan State 

86, Michigan 68

All signs pointed toward a 

Wolverine victory headed into 
their in-state rivalry game with 

the Spartans on Feb. 19. Michigan 
was 21-6 entering the contest — 
13-0 at home — and prepared for 
its biggest home crowd ever for 
its “break the attendance record” 
game.

The Wolverines accomplished 

the feat with an attendance 
of 12,707, but suffered their 
second-worst 
defeat 
of 
the 

season. While Michigan lost 
the previous game to Indiana in 
Bloomington, its first and only 
home loss to Michigan State 
exposed a lot of the Wolverines’ 
flaws and marked their descent 
out of the Associated Press top-
25 poll and eventually the NCAA 
Tournament.

Best 
individual 

performance: 
Katelynn 

Flaherty in the WNIT

The junior guard’s scoring 

prowess — Flaherty averaged 
20.2 points per game this season 
— is a mainstay for Michigan, 
making her appearance in this 
category unsurprising. Even on 
the biggest stage she has ever 
played on, Flaherty still managed 
to shine on offense with 21.3 
points per contest in the six 
WNIT games.

Her biggest impact came in the 

WNIT championship, though. 
Flaherty didn’t make any of her 
first-quarter field goal attempts, 
but rebounded strongly with 
those two game-tying 3-pointers 
and 27 total points to re-energize 
her team.

Most important game: Penn 

State 76, Michigan 75

Even with losses down the 

stretch to Indiana and Michigan 
State, 
the 
Wolverines 
still 

appeared to be a lock for the 
Tournament before their regular 
season finale against the Nittany 
Lions. But tied at 75 with five 
seconds remaining, a shooting 
foul committed by sophomore 
center Hallie Thome put Penn 
State on the free throw line. 
The Nittany Lions only hit one 
of two attempts, but it was all 
they needed to top Michigan and 
seemingly seal the Wolverines’ 
fate out of the Big Dance, as they 

lost three of their final four Big 
Ten contests.

Most 
improved 
player: 

Jillian Dunston

The 
junior 
forward, 
who 

started just nine games and 
played 19.6 minutes per game in 
the 2015-16 season, started all 37 
games for Michigan this season 
and bumped her playing time up 
to 28.9 minutes per game. Her 
point total increased marginally 
from 4.4 to 5.8 points per game, 
but her efforts on the glass — 
7.7 rebounds a game — were the 
best on the team. Dunston’s most 
valuable contribution, though, 
has been her newfound role as 
the Wolverines’ emotional leader. 
She is often the most animated 
player on the court, and has 
become a vocal representative 
for Michigan during games. 
According to Flaherty, Dunston 
even guaranteed a 10-point win 
during a team huddle before 
the third overtime of the WNIT 

championship.

Most valuable player: Hallie 

Thome

It wouldn’t be wrong to put 

Katelynn Flaherty here as WNIT 
MVP and first team All-Big Ten 
honoree, but the Wolverines 
relied most heavily on Thome, 
their best frontcourt big. The 
sophomore center averaged 16.2 
points and 7.1 rebounds per game, 
and had her second consecutive 
season in the nation’s top-10 
for field goal percentage at 61.3. 
Thome was also a first team All-
Big Ten honoree.

Thome’s 
achilles’ 
heel 
— 

foul trouble — also makes her 
Michigan’s most valuable player. 
In seven of the Wolverines’ nine 
losses, Thome either had four 
fouls or fouled out, and had 
three fouls in the other two. 
With Thome off the court, it 
was exponentially harder for 
Michigan to win, a conviction 
that came to fruition.

Personal Statement: Reflection

Based on “Long Distance” by Victor Lavelle
Preface: This is an essay originally published by my 

high school Prize Papers collection at the end of my senior 
year. As a senior in college graduating in three weeks, 
many of the same insecurities I struggled with at the time 
are still with me today, which is why I decided to come 
back to this piece. The essay has been slightly revised 
from its initial version.
T

he longest I had gone without viewing my 
reflection was three weeks when I was in high 
school. I had a systematic way of avoiding 

mirrors. I would wake up in the morning, look down as 
I entered my bathroom, brush my teeth with my eyes on 
the faucet, brush my hair with my head turned to the 
side and apply copious amounts of kohl around my eye 
rims, using the cheap drugstore mirrors that only show 
your eyes. This was how I started my day.

I remember thinking that avoiding my reflection 

wasn’t too hard. I wouldn’t use public bathrooms where 
the mirrors were so big and hard to avoid, and if I really 
needed to look at myself, I would try to use opaque or 
grainy reflectives, such as car door windows. Looking 
back, this entire practice seems bizarre, as I knew I was 
a kind, passionate, loyal and intelligent 15-year-old. But I 
also believed I was ugly, and this somehow marred any 
good quality I possessed.

I wouldn’t always do this ritual. My parents used to 

tell me I was a cute baby, and my deep black eyes would 
twinkle in the sun. Not only that, but I had a pretty smile 
— one that made my eyes scrunch up and my lips pull 
back to reveal my entire top row of teeth.

Things went downhill when I began losing teeth. I 

had dreadful teeth. Not only did I lose all my top and 
bottom ones at around the same time, which ruined my 
precious smile, but my adult teeth grew in uneven and 
angled. My unsightly orthodontics, coupled with the 
pubescent shadow on top of my upper lip and between 
my eyebrows, were reasons why I lost the attention of 
adults and began my lifelong battle with self-image.

Then came my “tween years.” My body stretched 

vertically, my hair got oily, my cheeks sunk in, my feet 
grew too fast for my balance to keep up — I thought I 
looked like the South Asian version of the girl from 
“The Ring.” But since everyone around me was equally 
awkward, I was still looking at mirrors just fine.

It was in my sophomore year of high school that 

my self-perception dropped to an all-time low. All of a 
sudden, everyone left behind his or her awkward stage. 
Braces were coming off as bodies were filling in. Except 

for me. I stayed brace-faced, bony and undesirable.

I blamed my mirror. It showed me everything that was 

wrong with my life. I came to believe that if the mirror 
showed me someone beautiful, someone like the models 
or actresses, my life would be better. Instead, boys didn’t 
want me because of what I saw in the mirror. I mean, 
how could they, with my braces and my stringy hair and 
my oily skin. Out of shame, I walked with my head down 
most of the time, my shoulders hunched, trying not to let 
anyone, including myself, see my face.

In my delusional state, I convinced myself that after 

my braces came off, I would finally be attractive enough 
to look myself in the mirror. I believed that my entire 
world would change — that I would go from being an 
awkward, gangly teenager to a straight-toothed young 
lady. So upon coming home with my newly unshackled 
pearly whites, I went straight to my bathroom, turned 
on the lights and faced my mirror.

But nothing happened.
I was expecting fireworks, a beautiful brunette with 

tan skin and a Julia Roberts smile to stare back at me. 
But my mirror did not show me that. I was basically the 
same girl — the same awkward girl with lanky hair, bony 
elbows and a budding hunchback. I stared at myself for 
half an hour, trying to see another reflection, but I could 
not.

And that’s when I realized it wasn’t the mirror — it 

was me. I avoided mirrors to convince myself that I could 
be happy even if I knew I didn’t like the way I looked. 
However, only after looking at my reflection, really 
looking at it, did I realize that this was not true. I hated 

mirrors because I believed I was “unattractive” and 
somehow less of a person. But I realized I was blaming 
my looks for my own personal failures in life instead of 
taking responsibility for them. So no matter how hard 
it was, I forced myself to look at mirrors and appreciate 
what I saw. I forced myself to stop avoiding my reflection 
and come to terms with who I am, flaws and all. I made 
myself pick my head up when I walked and look people 
in the eyes so they, too, could see my face. It wasn’t easy, 
but as I became more comfortable looking at myself, I 
slowly started to like what I saw. I was starting to stop 
hating mirrors.

* * *
Summer 2012. I was at day camp, trying to get my 

group of rambunctious 6-year-olds to settle down and 
do their coloring activity, when I caught Demetrius 
looking at me. He was one of the few counselors I had 
never spoken to, but I knew he was really popular with 
the kids. He had curly hair, a tall, slender build and 
hazel eyes that were pointed right at me. My palms 
immediately started sweating — I knew there must have 
been something on my face or something embarrassing 
that I had just done. I quickly shuffled to the other side of 
the table, away from his vantage point.

He stayed back after class to help me clean up and 

introduced himself. We spoke for a bit, mainly about the 
kids we thought were cute or the other counselors we 
both knew. On his way out, he smiled at me and said, 
“You have pretty eyes,” before shutting the door behind 
him.

I caught my reflection in the window, ash gray and 

dotted with translucent raindrops. Now when I look in 
mirrors, I see a new girl staring back at me. I see a girl 
who has a sincere smile and kind eyes. I see a girl who 
doesn’t need physical beauty to define her, as she knows 
physical beauty should not determine a person’s worth. 
She walks with her head held high and makes better eye 
contact with people. But she is only who I appear to be.

The girl I see, the one who stands tall and tries to make 

it seem like she does not care what anyone thinks of her, 
somehow formed around the reflection I used to see, 
the skinny, awkward girl. Although this new reflection 
may appear confident, she still has the insecurities of 
the old reflection, buried inside her, that will never fully 
disappear. But she’ll never stop trying to overcome her 
self-doubt.

I

n the skinny budget 
proposed in March 
by 
President 

Donald 
Trump, 

the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting 
would 
be 

defunded. The agency, which 
carries a budget of about $445 
million, would lose all its money 
and, as a result, public media 
stations and producers are 
slated to lose sizable amounts of 
their budgets.

This isn’t the first time that 

the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting was threatened 
with budget cuts. During a 
presidential debate in 2012, 
Republican Mitt Romney said 
he would cut the agency’s 
funding.

“I’m going to the stop the 

subsidy to PBS,” he said. “… 
I like PBS. I love Big Bird. I 
actually like you (Jim Lehrer), 
too. But I’m not going to keep 
on spending money on things 
to borrow money from China to 
pay for it.”

However, in this round of 

budget cuts, Big Bird wouldn’t 
be directly threatened by the 
cuts. Back in 2015, Sesame 
Workshop, which produces 
“Sesame Street,” signed a deal 
with HBO to help fund the 
show in return for access to 
new episodes nine months 
before they air on PBS.

Still, 
local 
stations 
and 

production 
companies 

would be heavily affected 
by 
the 
proposed 
cuts 
to 

the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting. One of those 
entities is The Fred Rogers 
Company. 
This 
production 

company started as the home for 
the classic children’s program 
“Mr. Rogers Neighborhood,” 
but in 2010, it started producing 
original programs of its own.

The new flagship for the 

company is “Daniel Tiger’s 
Neighborhood.” 
The 
show, 

which 
features 
characters 

from Mr. Rogers’s Land of 
Make Believe, follows Daniel, 
a 4-year-old tiger who deals 

with similar issues to normal 
4-year-olds. The show focuses 
mostly on teaching kids social 
and emotional skills.

In a phone interview, Ellen 

Doherty, 
the 
executive 
in 

charge of production at the 
Fred Rogers Company, talked 
about how the show continues 
Rogers’s legacy by speaking to 
children at their own age.

“That was what Fred was 

really 
committed 
to 
was 

thinking about what do kids 
know and what do they need,” 
she said. “In producing the 
program, we and our partners 
at Out of the Blue Productions 
are looking at (questions like) 
‘Is this the right thing to say?’ 
‘Is this how Daniel, who’s age 
4, would talk?’ ‘Is this what he 
would be thinking about?’ ”

For Doherty, the themes of 

“Daniel Tiger” resonate with 
children because the show’s 
stories parallel what a young 
child would deal with in their 
lives, too.

“‘Daniel Tiger deals with 

the issues that are tough for 
toddlers. Daniel has to learn 
how to use the potty; he has to 
learn how to get along with his 
friends; he has to learn how to 
deal when he has a brand-new 
baby sister and he’s not the one 
in the spotlight all the time 
anymore. Those are huge issues 
when you are 2-, 3- and 4-year-
olds.”

The Fred Rogers Company 

also produces “Peg + Cat.” This 
program, 
which 
primarily 

focuses on teaching math 
skills, follows Peg and her best 
friend, Cat, as they try and solve 
problems using the math skills 
they use in the episode.

“Each episode focuses on 

one or two themes in math 
and Peg and/or Cat encounter 
a problem, Doherty said. “Peg 
is totally freaking out to try 
and figure out how to fix it 
and then she fixes it and then 
they 
encounter 
something 

else, another iteration of that 
math. So it shows persistence in 

problem solving. Persistence is 
huge with math.”

The other show The Fred 

Rogers Company produces is 
“Odd Squad.” The series follows 
a group of agents who use 
math skills to battle “Oddness” 
in their world. It’s targeted 
at a slightly older age group 
than the other two programs. 
According to Doherty, the spy 
premise connects with the 
show’s viewers.

The Fred Rogers Company 

receives the funding to produce 
these programs from a variety of 
sources including corporations, 
government 
agencies 
and 

the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting. According to a 
company spokesperson, they 
would be affected by cuts to the 
CPB and would have to rework 
their plan to make up for the 
deficit.

For the people in public 

media, these shows reach out to 
children, as well as parents. The 
Fred Rogers Company released 
an app this year called “Daniel 
Tiger for Parents.” It’s meant to 
give parents access to materials 
to help guide them through 
helping their child through a 
difficult moment like a temper 
tantrum.

Detroit Public Television, 

Detroit’s 
public 
television 

station, uses the characters 
and 
resources 
created 
in 

conjunction with Fred Roger 
Company’s shows in local 
events on its own.

Tara Hardy, an education 

specialist 
at 
the 
station, 

discussed its role in a phone 
interview.

“When we bring a Daniel 

Tiger character to an event, it’s 
like bringing a rock star to a 
concert for 5-year-olds.”

“Peg + Cat” also played a big 

role in one of Detroit Public 
Television’s key educational 
initiatives. It receives funding 
through a grant the Department 
of Education called the Ready 
to Learn grant.

“The Ready to Learn grant is 

designed to go into classrooms 
and into schools. We were able 
to bring in iPads and tablets to 
classrooms and were able to 
train teachers on how to use 
their smart boards. There’s a 
few smart board activities that 
“Peg + Cat” put out that the kids 
just ate up. I mostly worked 
with kindergarten classrooms. 
... “Peg + Cat” was one of the 
favorites.”

According to Hardy, this 

grant would go away in the event 
that the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting is defunded. The 
full impact of the defunding 
for the station isn’t yet known, 
but a station spokesman wrote 
in an email to the Daily, “It will 
prevent us from expanding our 
work in that space and offering 
early-childhood 
education 

programming to those who 
need it most.”

Detroit Public Television also 

tries to reach out to parents 
through a series of interstitials 
between programs on its new 
24-hour PBS Kids channel.

“A lot of the times we’re 

leading them to PBS resources 
or we’re saying ‘it’s a gorgeous 
day outside today. Why don’t 
you take the child to the park?’ 
to help empower parents,” she 
said. “Those are the parents 
who don’t have their kids in 
preschool or are not active if 
their kids are school age at the 
school. We’re able to talk to 
them and that’s a really unique 
position in the field of early 
childhood.”

Also, there are kids in the 

Detroit metro area who don’t 
have access to a preschool 
education.

“What we’ve found in our 

work in Detroit and around 
the areas is there’s not enough 
slots in preschools for every 
child that’s four to be in,” 
Hardy said. “We like to see 
ourselves as a supplement to a 
quality preschool program, but 
we also like to see ourselves as 
providing the content as best 
we can without that social piece 

to families that really don’t 
have the access to a quality 
preschool.”

For Hardy, the possible 

defunding of the CPB is 
frustrating.

“I’ve been working here for 

roughly three years. I have 
really in those three years 
discovered how powerful and 
impactful public media can be, 
especially working with young 
children and working with 
parents. Kids are watching TV 
no matter what we do. ... Public 
media has the chance to put 
quality in front of those kids.”

For 
Doherty, 
the 

noncommercial nature of PBS 
allows for the ability to create 
different kinds of shows that 
wouldn’t otherwise be on 
television.

“Public broadcasting is really 

unique. … Public media is a 
great safe zone for kids,” she 
said. “Fred (Rogers) literally 
helped get it funded through is 
testimony to Congress and what 
he called the expression of care 
for children and families. That’s 
really what’s kept me working 
in public media for most of my 
career is knowing that’s it’s 
really helping, making content 
that really helps kids and that 
reaches a lot of kids who don’t 
necessarily have other ways to 
get TV content.”

After many years of working 

in public media, Doherty has 
seen how the shows she has 
made has changed the lives 
of the children who watched 
them.

“You’re 
going 
to 
hear 

from kids in 10 years talking 
about how ‘Daniel Tiger’s 
Neighborhood’ had a lasting 
influence on them,” Doherty 
added. “That’s what’s unique 
about public media. We want 
to make sure that we’re making 
shows that people watch, but 
we want to make shows that 
are good for kids and give 
them valued stuff but without 
the pressures that commercial 
channels face.”

The Pedicab Man

the story behind Boober Tours

b y Av i S h o l k o f f, Daily Sports Writer
“

Boober Tours! The only way!”

Pedestrians stare at Kevin Span-

gler, the six-foot-five man wearing a 

long black jacket who is pedaling on a 

pedicab on a mid-afternoon day.

“Boober Tours! The only way!” 

Spangler shouts again, hoping someone will notice 

him. It’s a typical day for Spangler. He bikes all 

around Central Campus and downtown Ann Arbor, 

from the Diag to Rick’s to Blank Slate Creamery.

Some recognize him. A man in a red pickup truck 

rolls down his window at a traffic light and strikes 

up a chat. A group of men seated on the sidewalk 

outside Salads Up excitedly yells at Kevin: “Boober 

Tours!” followed by “What’s up Kevin?”

Others seem more mystified by the man peddling 

on the pedicab, but are friendly nonetheless such as 

the young couple pushing a stroller, or the elderly 

duo in matching Michigan gear.

To most Ann Arborites, Spangler is an omnipres-

ent, optimistic feature of their downtown. Most 

don’t know of his multiple stints in prison, his strug-

gles with alcoholism or his homelessness.

All they see is a man cheerfully laughing, some-

times wearing a banana suit as he solicits riders.

“For extra tips,” he explains to me.

***

Spangler grew up in Manchester, a modest town-

ship roughly 20 minutes southwest of Ann Arbor, as 

the son of a corrections officer and a nurse. From 5 

years old until the time he graduated high school, he 

dealt with attention deficit disorder, taking Ritalin 

and Adderall throughout his education. Spangler 

developed severe anxiety and socially isolated him-

self. After serving in the military, he began dealing 

drugs.

“When you’re taking medication for ADD, it 

makes you into a robot,” Spangler recalls. “I never 

talked to anybody, I never really had any friends 

in school, and then it wasn’t until I quit taking the 

medication that I became this social butterfly. I got 

into dealing drugs.”

Joining the Navy straight out of high school, he 

was able to end his Ritalin addiction. However, alco-

hol became his new drug of choice. After leaving 

the service, he worked as a chef for the Washtenaw 

Country Club and became the locker room manager, 

a position he worked for a year. Because of his suc-

cess in his position, he found himself traveling to 

outside of Los Angeles to work as a locker room man-

ager at Moorpark Country Club — considered one of 

the best country clubs in the United States in 2002.

But then his drinking problem brought his for-

tunes down. He lost that job because of a DUI viola-

tion, the first of many.

By 2010, Spangler married, but soon divorced 

because of a “marijuana business that got out of 

control,” according to an article he wrote in Ground-

cover News.

As a drug dealer, he still grappled with alcohol 

addiction. By June of 2015, he had been given a total 

of five DUIs and a prison sentence.

In December 2015, he left prison for the final 

time. Although he had been in and out before, this 

time was different. He learned he would be having 

a son — named Romando — and he was motivated to 

change his life.

With few job prospects available because of his 

criminal record, Spangler needed to flex his creative 

muscles. As he emphasized throughout our inter-

view, he remained undeterred.

“When you get in trouble, you lose your rights to 

get a regular job,” Spangler explained. “When they 

do a criminal check, you could be the best person 

in the world, but if you have a criminal record, you 

don’t get the job. I’ve had to struggle, start my own 

businesses, wait tables, anything I can.”

After prison, Spangler found a safe haven in the 

Robert J. Delonis Center, a homeless shelter on West 

Huron Street, where he lived for three months. 

While in Ann Arbor, he discovered Groundcover 

News — a community newspaper that employs local 

homeless people as vendors and writers — from 

existing vendors around town. Spangler wrote regu-

larly for a year, according to publisher Susan Beckett.

“The thing that touches me most is how commit-

ted he is to his son,” Beckett said. “When he started 

(at Groundcover), his girlfriend was pregnant and he 

made it clear he wanted to turn his life around and 

be the kind of father he always wanted to be, and 

he’s doing that. He’s gone from living in the shelter to 

now having a place where his son can be with him.”

Though he no longer consistently writes for the 

paper, he often attends the organization’s socials 

once or twice a month, according to Beckett. Dur-

ing our ride last Thursday, he waved and exchanged 

pleasantries with a vendor on State Street too.

“I don’t regret anything I have ever done, as it has 

made me the person I am today,” Spangler wrote in 

the January 2016 edition of Groundcover. “I own it 

and I am using everything I ever went through as a 

tool to help me with future.”

Spangler enrolled at Washtenaw Community 

College briefly, but as was the case earlier in his life, 

classes proved challenging for him because of his 

ADD. Spangler realized that college wasn’t the path 

for him. Groundcover provided some financial liter-

acy and budgeting courses, something that Spangler 

emphasized was essential to avoiding the plagues of 

drugs and alcohol.

Spangler explained that he had heard extensive 

complaints from Uber and Lyft drivers in town who 

complained about their experiences with their par-

ent companies. If the drivers were unhappy, Span-

gler asserted, their riders were equally unsatisfied, 

thus opening the space for a pedal-powered on-

demand transportation service.

By January 2016, he saved up to purchase his first 

pedicab. Day and night, residents and citizens of 

Ann Arbor would begin to notice the tall man wear-

ing a costume outside Skeeps at 2 a.m.

At first, he kept the pedicabs behind a bus station 

on the outskirts of town, underneath some tarps. 

Then, he expanded his fleet and moved them into a 

small storage unit, but that soon became too tight as 

well.

He initially intended to have three pedicabs by 

the summer of 2016. After finding large demand, 

however, he expanded it to 10.

Riding with Boober Tours is free, though cus-

tomers are encouraged to give their pedalers tips, 

and they often do. Spangler’s company is funded by 

donations. Because of his work at Groundcover, Ben-

nett explained that Boober is eligible for donation 

matches from Groundcover. Thus far, he’s received 

$5,000 in donations and $2,200 in loans. He addi-

tionally reinvests earnings from cab rides back into 

his company.

His first pedicab merely served as his first step. 

Spangler dreams of a ride-hailing app, of even add-

ing cars and perhaps trolleys to his network. Pres-

ently, though, he focuses on his 14 pedicabs, manned 

by a pool of seasonal and full-time pedalers — only a 

year after he began Boober Tours.

While Spangler’s company has experienced tre-

mendous growth in just over a year, he still sees 

greater returns on the horizon. As spring turns into 

summer, Spangler will look to hire additional pedi-

cab drivers to expand his business.

In the winter, fewer people drive because of 

weather and reduced demand, but that doesn’t faze 

Spangler. He’ll drive rain or shine. He never wants to 

have a boss again.

***

But starting Boober Tours isn’t enough for Span-

gler. He seeks to additionally help those who strug-

gled like himself, recovering drug addicts or those 

with ADD.

As a former addict, Spangler says he comprehends 

how an addiction can affect not only an individual 

but his or her family and social circle as well. He uti-

lizes his business to find positions for those just out 

of rehab or struggling with drugs or alcohol. A hand-

ful of his current employees are recovering addicts.

“I want to inspire people,” Spangler said. He aims 

to create economic opportunity for those whom 

society — and many of its employers — has all but 

closed its doors on.

For Spangler, his own personal struggles with 

drug addiction are vital to his empathy with those 

who have gone through similar tragedies.

Walking into the warehouse where Spangler 

stores his pedicabs, there’s a whiteboard filled with 

ideas: plans for Boober, plans for other businesses, 

advertising and for his personal future.

“I have a tiered process of how I’m going to get 

there over the next year-to two years,” Spangler said. 

“Back in December, I knew I was going to turn this 

company into a million-dollar company, but then 

I was like, ‘Why stop at a million dollars? Why not 

make this a billion-dollar company?’ ”

With 14 pedicabs, Spangler may well be on his 

way. Riding through the Diag on a Thursday after-

noon, he seemed comfortable on the University of 

Michigan campus, waving to a number of students 

and even stopping to answer questions.

One man asked him about any events happening 

around Ann Arbor in the upcoming weekend. “Hash 

Bash,” he replied with a smile. “It’s a good day for 

business.”

Riding throughout the city, Spangler holds a smile 

on his face, complimenting the beautiful 55-degree 

weather, uncharacteristic for a March in Ann Arbor.

Spending time with Spangler, it becomes evident 

that he simply wishes to make the most of life. That 

sentiment is echoed by others, such as LSA sopho-

more Brendan Genaw, the incoming president of 

OptiMize — a social entrepreneurship student orga-

nization — who has spoken with him a number of 

times.

Genaw explained that Spangler came in contact 

with Jeff Sorenson — the founder of OptiMize and 

a University alum — who encouraged Spangler to 

attend a workshop. While at OptiMize, he discussed 

his business model and success. He even gave some 

of the students a ride home afterward.

At another workshop, Spangler became more 

personal. He told them his origin story, how he pro-

gressed from prison to his current position.

“That was something cool for our people to hear 

because a lot of them actually know what Boober is,” 

Genaw said. “It’s not like he’s the CEO of some super 

high-tech company that no one is ever aware of. He’s 

someone that’s in Ann Arbor and they’re constantly 

around him too.”

The positive experience that Genaw explained is 

a constant feature during a Boober tour with Span-

gler. He’ll ask customers about their goals, their 

motivations and their dreams. He’ll play music from 

an auxiliary cord, and he’ll do what he can to engage 

his riders.

This positivity radiates from Spangler not just on 

his pedicab but in conversation as well. His enthusi-

asm is contagious. You speak to him and he has such 

a joy, a passion for his work and for life.

“I just kind of felt when I was growing up as a 

child that I was going to do something massive to 

help the world,” Spangler said. “I always had that, 

but I feel like I had to go through the struggles I 

went through (in order to do it). To help somebody, 

you need to go through what they’ve been through. 

I’ve kind of mastered it and now in the future I want 

that for my company, since it’s second chance jobs for 

people in recovery.”

But Spangler wasn’t always this positive, hap-

py-go-lucky individual. At times in his life, he felt 

depressed and at one point suicidal. Starting Boober 

Tours reversed his outlook.

He explains that, as a pedicab driver, he exercises 

every day and engages in breathing exercises such 

as the Wim Hof method and the Nam Myoho Renge 

Kyo, a Buddhist breathing technique he learned 

from his aunt.

Now a year in and about 19 months sober, he 

reflects on how he began. His parents barely took 

care of him in prison.

“There’s a difference between Democrats and 

Republicans: Democrats take care of their kids in 

prison, Republicans don’t,” he quipped.

But they did send Spangler books. Anthony Rob-

bins’s self-help book “Awaken the Giant Within” par-

ticularly inspired him. He set goals for himself, goals 

he continues to look at each day. Without these “mas-

sive goals,” Spangler explains, he would have strug-

gled to accomplish anything. He says goal-setting is 

imperative for struggling individuals.

***

It’s likely you’ve seen the tall, lanky man on a 

Boober. Perhaps you’ve been slightly intoxicated 

at 2 a.m., or perhaps you’ve been walking in the 

Diag in the middle of a school day.

But maybe now, you’ll know why the man is 

wearing a ridiculous costume. Maybe, instead of 

shaking your head, you’ll ask him for a ride and 

ask about his story.

It’s safe to say, however, that no matter the 

time or day, Spangler wears a smile on his face. 

He’ll wave and exchange pleasantries with those 

he knows and make small talk with those who 

doesn’t.

It’s not weird, it’s normal. It’s how Spangler 

acts.

Like Boober Tours, it’s the only way.

Wednesday, April 5, 2017 // The Statement
6B
Sports is Art

It took me four seconds to spot Teddy in a 

line of 50 students outside Crisler Center. He 
stood tall in a bright-yellow Pikachu costume 
holding a small Tim Horton’s hot chocolate in 
his right hand.

As I approached him, he seemed to be talk-

ing a little bit to a lot of people. He told me we 
would be let inside the Crisler Center — home 
of the University of Michigan’s men’s and 
women’s basketball teams — in about 15 min-
utes. I settled into the back of the line, gearing 
up for the wait to be longer than what Teddy 
predicted. Looking around, I noticed how 
quiet this line of Michigan sports fans was.

Football Saturdays at the University are 

equated with Christmas morning by many 
of my friends — though, of course, instead 
of candy before breakfast, it’s shots. There 
really isn’t a time on this campus when you 
can’t find students in jerseys on front porch-
es, celebrating their team.

Needless to say, at 5 p.m. on a Thursday at 

Crisler Center, I was expecting a line full of 
rowdy kids. But instead, I was surrounded 
by peaceful, dedicated students waiting in 
not so visible anticipation for the basketball 
game. They stood as if it were their job, not 
their pleasure. Which, in a way, it was.

I was standing in line with Maize Rage, 

the golden T-shirt-wearing student section, 
for the Michigan vs. Wisconsin basketball 
game. Many students in line two hours early 
are a part of the Maize Rage Core — the 
smaller group of more dedicated students 
who have weekly meetings to plan cheers 
and sit at the front of the student section for 
every game.

LSA Engineering senior Teddy Tran is an 

icon of the group. He’s dedicated countless 
hours to the Maize Rage and many more to 
talking about basketball with his family and 
friends. He’s been following the Michigan 
basketball team since his senior year of high 
school. He’s been to 31 football games and 
almost 70 basketball games.

“I found a passion for the sport and I got 

invested,” Teddy said to me as we sit down in 
the first row of the bleachers.

***
As a student at the University, I feel iso-

lated from the exhilarating force of sports 
culture that reverberates between students. 
Students like Teddy, who make this men-
tal, emotional and monetary investment in 
sports.

Walking down East Hoover Avenue and 

then South Main Street for the first time 
my freshman year, it was as if I could taste 
the community. Shouting “Go Blue” can 
stand for the entire Michigan community 
anywhere else. But here, on this street, the 
phrase meant I supported a group of people 
playing a sport I do not care about.

My lack of interest in sports doesn’t stem 

from a lack of understanding: I was a cheer-
leader in high school — I had to learn the 
rules and watch football games closely to 
know when and what cheers to do.

Sitting in the Big House for the first time, 

I remember tasting it. I can still taste it. I 
understand there’s a powerful community 
at work on campus, but what I don’t under-
stand is the foundation that brings this com-
munity together. Extract the crowds, the 
multi-billion-dollar entertainment industry, 
and even the comradery. What I’m asking is: 
What is it that draws humans to sports?

***
Over Spring Break, I sat down next to my 

dad to watch the Chargers play the Kansas 
City Chiefs — something I never do. “The 
Chargers” is a term I heard growing up so 
often that I never actually thought about its 
meaning. I understood the word “Charger” 
as a sports team before I ever thought about 
the verb it was connected to, or the gold-
rimmed platter that sits under china din-
ner plates, or the type of horse or even the 
phone-charging device. To my family, “The 
Chargers” was a team, a dinner table conver-
sation go-to and a reason for my sister and I 
to get out of the house on Sunday afternoons.

I try to look for the box with the score and 

the elusive timestamp on it (a time that was 
incredibly deceiving to me as a child: Four 
minutes and three seconds never actually 
meant four minutes and three seconds). I 
feel a familiar ache in my stomach as I real-
ize the game won’t be over soon and an even 
larger ache for how incapable I feel when I 
try to connect with people who love sports. 
No matter how attentive I try to be, how 
much I listen and learn, how large of a Big-
Ten-sports-playing university I attend, I 
could never become a sports fan.

My dad hears me sigh. I turn my head 

toward him and smile skeptically. He reach-
es his arm towards me and pulls me next to 
him.

“I wish I could explain better to you what 

sports mean to me …” he trailed off. “Why I 
care about it just so much.”

I laugh softly and mostly to myself. It is 

the type of laugh that masks the irreproach-
able dearth of understanding between the 
two of us. He wishes he could explain, but 
could he? Could I? Could I find concrete 
answers to why he, and so many, love sports 
in a way I never could? Why I can list out my 
friends who are sports fans vs. non-sports 
fans? And why, to non-sports fans, caring 
about sports feels so irrational?

***
My father grew up playing sports: Foot-

ball, basketball and baseball for the small 
city on the even smaller island of Coronado, 
Calif., with a large sports community. I rea-
son to myself that watching the sports he 
once practiced and played is a form of study-
ing for him — it is useful and interesting to 
watch experts play the form you once or still 
work hard to play.

“Having played sports as a child there 

was a sense of ease and harmony between 
different parts of myself: body and mind 
primarily,” said Santiago Colas, an associ-

ate professor of comparative literature and 
arts, ideas and the humanities. “With that, 
a kind of absorption and a lack of self-con-
sciousness that felt like freedom. Freedom 
to exercise my capacities as a person, as a 
whole person.”

Teddy, who sits next to me at the basket-

ball game, didn’t play sports growing up.

“To be honest, I think I’m an anomaly,” 

Teddy told me. “I did robotics in high school, 
but no tennis, no football, no basketball or 
stuff like that. But for some reason, here I 
am, dressed like a Pikachu and all.”

However, Teddy is not an anomaly.
Andrei Markovits, a professor of politi-

cal science, Germanic studies and sociology, 
has been studying sports cultures since the 
1980s. Markovits and David Smith, a doc-
toral student at the time in the Political Sci-
ence Department, conducted a study about 
undergraduates at the University, report-
ing on how many students attend sporting 
events, how often they watch sports on TV, 
who their favorite teams and players are, 
and how they support teams in the state of 
Michigan.

“Crudely put, one need not have played 

one second of football in one’s life to have 
developed into a rabid and highly knowl-
edgeable football fan,” Markovits wrote.

When I told Markovits about how I 

attended a Michigan men’s gymnastics meet 
to try to engage in a sport I once played, 
unlike football or basketball, he laughed at 
me.

For sports like gymnastics, the follow-

ers of the sport tend to also be doers of the 
sports. However, for sports such as basket-
ball, football, baseball, hockey, soccer and 
cricket — sports Markovits defines as “hege-
monic sports” — the followers outnumber 
the doers immensely.

“Football is the most post-modern sport, 

because virtually no American has ever 
played football like these guys play football,” 
Markovits said. “Very few people under-
stand. In fact, very few people have actually 
been to an NFL game, and yet if you look at 
the NFL, it is the most successful sport of all 
time.”

“There are a group of almost all men who 

we call the ‘sports omnivores,’ ” Markov-
itz says. “They basically are guys who were 
actually awful athletes but who are obsessed 
with sports. For them it really is an intel-
lectual in devour. … What is going on in is a 
form of identity.”

***
I’m sitting in the basement of Ashley’s 

on State Street talking to LSA senior Matt 
Fisher. There is a basketball game playing on 
a screen behind me. I ask him the question 
I’ve been asking everyone I meet this semes-
ter: Why does you love sports so much?

“Sports were a big part of my childhood,” 

Fisher says. “I first really got into sports 
with the Cleveland Cavaliers when LeBron 
came to the team in 2003. I was 9 years old 

and as I progressed through elementary 
school, middle school and high school, that 
was the golden age of Cleveland sports and 
Cavs basketball.”

When I asked Business senior Rikki 

Miner the same question, she was eager to 
tell me the same thing.

“Being from Chicago, sports are every-

thing,” Miner sIS. “We have a lot of storied 
history and teams in all Big Four sports 
leagues. My family is third-generation Bears 
season ticket holders, so I’ve been going to 
those games since I was an infant. My fam-
ily is also a huge Michigan sports family, so 
every Saturday growing up I watched the 
Michigan football games on TV, and our 
weekends were planned around the time of 
the game.”

And yet again, when I asked LSA senior 

Joseph Evans.

“To me, Michigan football is the holiest 

of holy things,” Evans says. “I learned about 
Michigan football from my dad, he taught 
me about it — we would always be watching 
games together. Sports represent a genera-
tional bond. Because it is a strong part of my 
family, I can identify with it. It is a part of 
my identity even though I’ve never played 
for them, never made a contribution beyond 
being a fan. But this leaves me feeling a part 
of the team and that’s why I care about it.”

Even for students who claim they are 

“non-sports-watching fans,” family identity 
contributes to their watching habits.

I found Shirley Wang’s “Sports Com-

plex: The Science Behind Fanatic Behavior” 
report observing how a fan’s identification 
with a sports team is similar to how someone 
identifies with their nationality, ethnicity or 
even gender. In it, Daniel Wann, a profes-
sor of psychology at Murray State Univer-
sity, defines this team identification as “the 
extent to which a fan feels a psychological 
connection to a team and the team’s perfor-
mances are viewed as self-relevant.”

This identity is a form of attachment for 

fans, and like multiple concepts within the 
study of sports psychology, it dates back to 
the ancient world of sports. David Potter, a 
professor of Greek and Roman History at 
the University, describes this idea of collec-
tive identity as one of the largest reasons for 
humans developing intense attachment to 
sports.

“As populations were brought away from 

rural roots, deracinated, put into cities and 
are taking up industrial jobs, there was an 
anxiety about them, people started to ask: 
‘Who are you?’ ”

Potter told me that the University, and 

universities across the country, recognized 
this powerful sense of identity and tapped 
into it.

“In the late 19th century and early 20th 

century, universities began to support sports 
as a way of reaching out into communities 
and helping to build a connection between 
themselves and the community that just

their academic mission often couldn’t do,” 
Potter said. “The stands for Michigan foot-
ball very early on were intended to be larger 
than the city of Ann Arbor. Again, it proved 
that the University was stretching its image.”

An hour and a half before the game, the 

inside of Crisler Center feels a bit like a 
shinier Disneyland. It’s pristinely clean, and 
there’s an overpowering cinnamon sugar 
smell floating throughout. “Bad and Boujee” 
is pulsating over the speakers.

I can see the first six rows already filled 

in with matching T-shirt-wearing students. 
The students next to me have their back-
packs in their laps and notebooks opened. 
Others fill out a quiz about basketball player 
fun facts. Despite their age difference and 
varying roles in the University community, 
everyone is united in this space.

This ecosystem works. Students come 

here to be entertained and support the team. 
The team thrives off the support the large 
fan base offers. The team does well and the 
fans are rewarded and the team is rewarded 
as well. It is a cyclical process.

For Teddy, it is this cyclical nature of 

sports — the scene I’m about to witness of 
fans and players collaborating together and 
feeding off one another — that brings him 
here each week.

“I love the passion, from both the ath-

letes and the fans,” Teddy says. “Especially 
in basketball, the team plays off our energy 
and we play off their energy and what they 
do in the game. When it’s great, this place is 
rockin’ and it’s just really fun to be a part of 
all of that.”

Teddy believes that although sports 

events are more about what the team does, 
the way his club consistently shows up to 
games and contributes to the environment 
helps.

“I mean obviously the players are playing 

but if one thing goes right it can turn into two 
or three things all in succession, and before 
you know it this place is rockin’, everyone is 
screaming, everyone is yelling, and for the 
other team it becomes very difficult because 
it is very loud, very chaotic … that’s how the 
crowd and the team play off each other.”

Though I’m suspicious, I respect this 

participant role. After all, don’t I have to? I 
worked for years playing the ideal partici-
pant: leading a whole group of girls in this 
exact phenomenon as high school cheer cap-
tain. The difference between Teddy and me, 
though, and Fisher and all of these students 
I interviewed, is that I didn’t believe in it. 
I cheered for other reasons such as physi-
cal fitness and leadership, but I never truly 
cheered for the team. I never truly believed 
that what I was doing was changing their 
game.

***
I turn around to see a screen playing a 

basketball game positioned behind the bar. 
I turn around and see Fisher’s eyes fixated 

on the screen and I feel the familiar ache of 
disconnection. Fisher cares, his eyes are still 
glued, but I don’t.

“I have no idea what the end result is going 

to be,” Fisher says. “No one knows what’s 
going to happen in a sports game — you are 
watching it unfold right in front of your eyes. 
That unpredictability I think allows for such 
an emotional range, and such a powerful 
experience.”

Prof. Colas noted that Fisher is picking 

up on this unpredictability, along with the 
fact that in sports there is an end result that 

is entirely clear cut — you either win or you 
lose.

“For people who are interested in other 

arts, sports can seem sometimes childish, or 
infantile. A novel isn’t either great or shitty, 
it depends a lot on where the reader is com-
ing from. But a team either won or lost. I 
don’t think that’s the best way to approach 
sports, with that narrow of an outlook, but 
(sports) are kind of built that way. They acti-
vate an appeal to people who are needing, 
for whatever reason, black and white, clear 
outcomes.”

And it’s exactly this tension that Colas 

presents that bothers me so much — I don’t 
want to find these sports games childish, I 
don’t want to roll my eyes and not under-
stand the irrational fervor I see in my dad’s 
eyes.

***
Art — mostly writing, but also diagram 

drawing — means a lot to me. Art’s power-
ful psychological benefits and productive 
means of expressing a form of the self are 
why I find it not just entertaining but wholly 
important.

I hold sports to this same standard 

because of the urgent rate at which society 
consumes them. Even though society loves 
art, discusses politics and even screams at 
music festivals, sports have a specific kind of 

spectatorship that I find so strange and dif-
ferent — it is a blind belief in an event you 
have no control over, but have a large emo-
tional investment in.

“The first thing I would think about every 

morning when I woke up for a week was the 
Michigan State game two years ago where 
they fumbled the punt,” Evans told me. “It’s 
100 percent irrational.”

I say I don’t understand it, but I continue 

to ask Evans about his experience.

“I felt such disappointment because I 

watched every game this team has played 

since I was 9 years old. It was my child-
hood dream for Michigan to win a national 
title while I was a student here, so I could 
feel like all of that hard work I had done, at 
times watching Michigan lose, paid off, in 
a culminating moment of going to a really 
significant sports game. It doesn’t matter if 
I have control over it or not, it just represents 
so much throughout my whole life. And it 
almost felt deserved, that I had earned it.”

The art that I interact with is entertain-

ing and impactful, but does not wake me up 
every morning feeling the weight of a bad 
concert or a win of a Grammy in the way 
that sports fans are emotionally affected by 
Michigan’s wins and losses.

“Winning or losing does not impact your 

object of life, and yet it matters so much,” 
Markovits says. “Look, I’ve studied it for 50 
years. I don’t know if you can ever really get 
at this. … It’s about a lot of things. … It’s about 
a form of comfort, a form of community.” He 
pauses. “It’s an imagined community — that 
is power. But in some way, it is also a low-
cost thing. Unlike in politics, if your party 
loses you will get bad policies, it has an effect 
on your life.”

***
As the basketball game begins, I force 

myself to pay close attention, follow the 
players with a new awareness that I haven’t 

previously. I try to better understand what 
Teddy has been telling me, what professors, 
students and my research have told me all 
semester, and what society has been telling 
me my whole life. And as I do it, it is hard not 
to be affected by the overpowering cheer-
ing crowd. I can barely hear my thoughts as 
cheers are flooding through my ears.

“For me there’s a more kind of micro-

level that unfolds repeatedly throughout the 
course of the sporting event,” Colas says to 
me. “What is the next play going to be? What 
is the player going to do with their body right 
now in this next instance in this challenge 
given to them by the rules of the game, the 
ability of their opponents, etc., etc.?”

It is at this micro-level beauty that I try to 

watch as the game unfold in front of me now — 
one player’s torso seems to disconnect from his 
hips as he pauses to fake a throw to his team-
mate, in blinks of eyelid time another player is 
already across the entire court swinging into 
the air to shoot, a pause, a dribble is so precise 
before a shot is made.

“I think that it’s important to human beings 

to be able to witness that beauty, dramatic ten-
sion and this sort of exhibition of a human being 
doing things that human beings are uniquely 
suited to do, and often don’t get to do, because 
of the way our lives are organized,” Colas says.

But as I watch the game and search for this 

type of beauty, what I think about is not the 
basketball players, but the gymnastics meet I 
attended last week. I remember my stomach 
tightening as my eyes traced over the gymnasts’ 
hands gripping the bar. My head raced as I 
imagined what type of flip may be coming next. 
My mouth opened in awe of the strength, agil-
ity, athleticism of those I was observing. And 
when players prepared on the sideline, I genu-
inely cheered and cared about the result.

This is perhaps a result of a combination of 

the factors I have experienced — being a gym-
nast when I was young, watching the Olympic 
gymnasts with my sister for years, respecting 
the hours of training and personal dedication 
the athletes make. But who is to say why I find 
this beautiful and not basketball plays? Or why 
I find spoken word poetry beautiful and not 
Michigan’s final football game?

“It is a matter of taste, a matter of upbringing; 

clearly there are a matter of social categories 
that impact it — it’s not completely random — 
but ultimately, it can’t be explained,” Markovits 
told me. “Ultimately, you cannot translate this. 
You cannot translate what is beautiful. It just 
is.”

With Maize Rage students roaring behind 

me and the final seconds racing down on the 
scoreboard clock in front of me, I’m more con-
tent feeling isolated in this crowd than I ever 
imagined. For those around me, I understand 
there’s beauty here, even if not for me. Sports, 
just as art, cannot be translated. Sports, just as 
art, just is.

beautiful garden in the Wailua River Valley called Smith’s Tropical Paradise. Its vibrant colors 

and beautiful scenery will stay with me forever.
