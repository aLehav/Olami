STATE BUDGET
Budget to
cut partner
benefits
State House approves
proposal to reduce
funding by 5 percent
By HALEY GLATTHORN
Daily Staff Reporter
A recent Michigan education
budget proposal moved into the
state Senate on May 5 with a provi-
sion that cuts funding by an addi-
tional 5 percent for universities
that offer benefits to the unmarried
partners of employees, including
those in same-sex partnerships.
The provision was proposed
by State Rep. Dave Agema (R-
Grandville) and supported by the
Republican-controlled state House
of Representatives. The proposal
would impact the University since
it currently provides domestic part-
nership benefits to its employees,
and would result in a 20-percent
loss in funding for the University
if passed, in addition to Republican
Gov. Rick Snyder's proposed 15per-
cent cut to higher education.
Gabe Javier, assistant direc-
tor of the University's Spectrum
Center, said the provision's conse-
quences would extend beyond the
University community.
"I think it hurts the state of
Michigan as a whole," Javier said.
"It sends a message about the
state's values (which results in)
people thinking that Michigan is
not LGBT-friendly."
Javier said the University has
"always been committed" to pro-
viding assistance to both hetero-
sexual and LGBT employees, but
he is uncertain to how the Univer-

The Lunch Room
offers array of vegan
food options
By PATRICIA SNIDER
Daily StaffReporter
Students enjoying a sum-
mer stroll through downtown
Ann Arbor ngay have noticed
the aroma of fresh fruit juice
smoothies and tofu sandwiches
wafting from a newly opened
vegan food cart on West Wash-
ington Street.
The Lunch Room - located
in the new outdoor food court
called Mark's Carts - opened last
Monday and is among numer-

ous venders selling food ranging
from authentic Asian street food
to Mexican delicacies.
Joel Panozzo, co-owner of
The Lunch Room, said the cart
was inspired by the personal
tastes and vegan lifestyle of both
him and his business partner,
Phillis Engelbert.
"We're both vegans, and our
cart is specifically vegan food
only," he said. "We've been doing
these private dinners and lunch-
es that we started in October,
and so we just wanted to serve
more vegan food to our friends
and other people."
Panozzo said he and Engel-
bert built the cart on their own
"from the ground up" after
securing a spot in the outdoor

food court and that they are
looking forward to serving both
vegans and non-vegans alike
with the hope of changing com-
mon misconceptions about vegan
food.
"We're excited to serve not
just vegans, and to serve meat-
eaters and everyone in-between
and to show people that they can
eat vegan and it can be satisfying,
fulfilling, inexpensive and com-
munally healthy," Panozzo said.
Panozzo said that while he
and Engelbert are "excited to
have a fun summer outside," they
hope that their cart may lead to
potential business opportuni-
ties in the future since they were
both working office jobs before

'U' Law students protest commencement speaker

Graduates organized
walkout in protest of
Senator's views
By PATRICIA SNIDER
Daily StaffReporter
About 50 students protested
the selection of U.S. Sen. Rob Port-
man (R-Ohio) as keynote speaker
at the University Law School's
commencement ceremony on
May 7 by walking out during his
address.
While choosing Portman as
commencement speaker gener-
ated an outcry from members
of the campus community, Law
School Dean Evan Caminker
said the event can be used as a
way to enhance conversation and
cooperation among students and
members of the University admin-
istration in the future.
According to Andrew Selbst -
a recent Law School graduate and
principal organizer of the walkout
- students protested Portman so
strongly because he is not a sup-
porter of gay rights and is openly

againstgay marriage.
Selbst said that the protest
was done in a respectful man-
ner that still effectively demon-
strated their disapproval, and that
students met in the hallway after
they walked out in a gathering
that was "very celebratory" and
"emotional."
"We got up silently, walked
out, we wanted to be the least dis-
ruptive as possible," he said. "We
didn't want to try to ruin gradu-
ation for anyone. We definitely
made our point."
Selbst added that in the
future students should be actively
involved in choosing speakers,
adding that the protest aimed
to make a statement to the Law
School administration that LGBT
issues should not be a point of con-
tention.
"The point of the protest
was really targeted towards the
administration," he said. "It was
saying that the legal community
has moved pass the point where
LGBT rights are just another thing
to disagree on, and instead saying
that this is not up for debate with
the nextgeneration of lawyers."

Selbst said that prior to the
commencement services, students
sent a letter of petition to mem-
bers of the Law School's admin-
istration asking them to recall
Portman as speaker, to which
Law School Dean Evan Caminker
replied with two e-mails to stu-
dents.
In an e-mail interview with
The Michigan Daily, Caminker
said students protested because of
their concerns over Portman's vot-
ing record in regards to gay rights
as a member of the U.S. House of
Representatives from 1993-2004.
In defense of Portman,
Caminker wrote that other news
sources have reported erroneous
information regarding the com-
mencement walkout.
"We've seen a lot of very
inaccurate information in vari-
ous public blogs and reports,"
Caminker wrote. "For example,
some described Senator Portman
as an active and vocal opponent
of gay rights - whereas, to my
knowledge and based on extensive
research, he has never spoken out
on these issues at all."
Caminker added that a lot of

sources misreported the actual
number of students that partici-
pated in the protest.
"Some of the stories signifi-
cantly overestimated the num-
ber of graduating students who
participated in the walkout - the
correct number is around 50," he
wrote. "Just under 50 graduat-
ing students, out of just over 300,
walked out and were joined by
some friends and family."
The walkout did not interfere
with commencement services,
and students participating in the
walkout were civil and received
no form punishment since they
"were exercising a First Amend-
ment right of free expression and
did so in a peaceful and orderly
way," Caminker wrote.
Caminker added that he met
individually with students or
groups who expressed concern
over choosing Portman as speaker
or who sent petitions to him.
"I received letters signed by a
group of students who were dis-
appointed with my selection," he
wrote. "I engaged in conversation
with many of our students indi-

High-speed rail to offer
increased tramvel options

Rail project aims
to connect cities in
Southeast Michigan
By LIANA ROSENBLOOM
Daily StaffReporter
Despite funding setbacks,
administrators at the Southeast
Michigan Council of Government
and the Michigan Department of
Transportation are continuing
to work on creating a high-speed
Ann Arbor-to-Detroit rail line,
which would be the first major
transit system in Southeast Mich-
igan.
The ultimate goal of the project
is to provide four roundtrip runs
every weekday from Ann Arbor
to Detroit with stops in Dearborn,
Ypsilanti and the Detroit Metro
Airport - a plan that is unfolding
in stages as a result of changes to

funding.
Funding constraints lessened
on May 9, when the federal gov-
ernment gave the state a $200
milliongrant and access to a sepa-
rate shared $336 million fund to
expand high-speed rail, according
to a May 9 article in the Detroit
Free Press.
Specifically, Michigan will
receive $2.8 million to build a
new rail station in Ann Arbor, as
well as $196.5 million for work on
the Detroit-Kalamazoo corridor,
according to the article. Part of
a separate $336 million grant will
help the state to purchase the nec-
essary trains and equipment for
the new raillines.
Tim Hoeffner, MDOT's admin-
istrator of high-speed rail and
innovative projects advancement,
said he thinks revitalizingthe rail
system will be a key transporta-
tion improvement in Southeast-

Gender diversity lacks at graduation

No women received
honorary degrees at
spring ceremony
By BRIENNE PRUSAK
Managing News Editor
Each year, distinguished profes-
sionals in a wide variety of careers
and hailing from various back-
grounds join the list of more than a
thousand honorary degree recipi-
ents from the University. But despite
the University's strive for diversity
in their selection, women appeared
to be underrepresented this year.
Five men were chosen to receive
honorary degrees at the University's
Spring Commencement ceremony on
April 30, including keynote speaker,
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder. Over
the past ten years, only 25 of the 88
- or about 28 percent - of recipients
have been women, according to the
University's official list of honorary
degree award winners.
University Provost Philip Hanlon
said University President Mary Sue
Coleman strives to select a diverse
mix of recipients, adding that she
invited women this year, but their
schedules didn't permit them to be
present at commencement - a stipu-
lation required in order for to receive
an honorary degree.
"President Coleman works very
hard each year to put together the
honorary degree recipients for both
the winter and spring commence-
ments," he said. "As it turned out
this year, none of the women invited
by President Coleman worked out
which is quite unusual as you will
see from our history of honorary
degree recipients."

"We are pleased that, taken as a
group, our honorary degree recipi-
ents over the prior two decades have
been a very diverse group," Hanlon
added.
This year's recipients included
Stephen Ross, a University alum who
has made substantial monetary con-
tributions to the University includ-
ing funding for the Ross School of
Business, Washington Post colum-
nist Eugene Robinson, former U.S.
Rep. and physicist Vernon Ehlers
executive chair of Ford Motor Com-
pany William Clay Ford, Jr. and film
producer, director and writer Spike
Lee.
According to Lisa Connolly, proj-
ect manager of the Honorary Degree
Committee at the University, recipi-
ents of the degrees are accomplished
in a way that relates to education or
service and have a connection to the
University or do work that aligns
with the University's efforts.
While Connolly said these char-
acteristics are important, diversity
of the honorees is also taken into
account as well as the schedules of
nominees, as they must be present at
the graduation ceremonies.
"We had a distinguished slate
of recipients, but the mix changes
from year to year," she said. "Efforts
are taken each commencement to
confirm a diverse slate of honorary
degree recipients, but timing of the
process and availability of invitees
both play a significant role. in the
outcome."
Each fall, students have the
opportunity to nominate people
they think are worthy of honorary
degrees, Connolly said.
She added that after the nomina-
tions have been submitted, the Hon-
orary Degree Committee - which is

comprised of the Dean of Rackham,
heads of executive offices, students,
faculty and alumni - consider the
nominations and recommend their
choices to Coleman and Vice Presi-
dent and Secretary of the University,
Sally Churchill. The last step is for
the Uaniversity's Board of Regents to
approve the decision, Connolly said.
It's tradition to give an honorary
degree to the commencement speak-
er as well, and that just as much con-
sideration goes into recipients for
winter commencement as for spring,
Connolly said.
Cindy-Sue Davis, director of
Women in Science and Engineer-
ing, said the University would like to
have more women recipients, adding
that she has been asked to nominate
women she thinks would be a good
choice to receive honorary degrees.
Despite the lack of women chosen
this year, Davis said she believes the
University does a good job in choos-
ing a diverse range of recipients.
"I think there are several expla-
nations - not excuses - that there
are more men, because the adminis-
trative level at the University does a
good job with diversity," she said.
Davis said the reason women
aren't nominated as often for hon-
orary degrees is because the nomi-
nations reflect the current state of
the workforce in society, and there
simply aren't as many women rep-
resented in high-level occupational
positions as men.
However, Davis said she believes
this will change over time and there
will be a more equal representation
of men and women in the future.
"It's not always the case (that
women are overlooked) and it's
something that will change over
time," Davis said.

in order to meet their financial
needs.
"We will probably do cater-
ing in the off season, and who
knows, maybe a restaurant
down the road, but we're defi-
nitely going to enjoy the cart and
flexibility that it gives us at this
point and time," Panozzo said.
Besides his own personal
ventures, Panozzo said he is
looking forward to seeing how
the food carts will transform
the Ann Arbor food scene, since
Mark's Carts offers an array of
dining options and innovative
ways of serving that custom-
ers may not necessarily find in
"a big brick and mortar restau-
rant."
Emma Machcinski, a senior
at Community High School, said
she likes the idea of The Lunch
Room because it has widespread
appeal.
"I think that it's really great
because I'm a vegan, and it's just
really great to see foods that
are vegan," Machcinski said.
"And also they're not necessary
just catering to super hippie-
like people ... they're trying to
appeal to everybody, and get the
word out about veganism with-
out hitting you over the head
with it."
Mark Hodesh, owner of
Mark's Carts, said he chose The
Lunch Room from a wide vari-
ety of applicants - specifically
35 carts applied for 7 spots -
because of its solid vision and
structure.
Hodesh added that The
Lunch Room had a strong pres-
ence on its first day and includ-
ing carts similar to theirs will
help Ann Arbor transition to a

new era of community dining.
"I've been in the neighbor-
hood 35 or 40 years, working
and running businesses and it
was very important to me to
have a gentle transition to the
residential Westside to down-
town," he said.
"These food carts are kind
of a low density development -
for people to flow, walk by, and
enjoy them."
Mark's Carts officially
opened on May 9 and is open
daily from 8 a.m. until 10 p.m.,
though each individual cart has
flexibility in choosing their own
hours of operations, according
to Hodesh.
Hodesh added that he was
inspired by the Brooklyn Flea
MarketinNewYork whiledevel-
oping the food court, which was
established on a vacant piece of
land he acquired near an empty
building he owned on West
Washington Street.
University alum Anna Fos-
ter said she likes the concept
of the outdoor carts and hopes
they will become more viable.
"I think Ann Arbor needs
more street food, that the main-
stream businesses are too afraid
of street foods, and that this (is)
a good step forward in having
a facility for them - and then
hopefully they will actually be
on the street," Foster said.
Foster added that the food
courts also have the potential to
positively impact the health of
Ann Arbor citizens.
"I think that Ann Arbor is
a very pedestrian-friendly city,
and we don't really take advan-
tage of it all of the time," she
said. "Things like food carts get
people out of their offices, walk-
ing to get food, and generally it's
not fried and it's not processed
as much, it's made by people."

sity will react if faced with funding
cuts.
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) said the amendment was
passed as a voice vote - a case in
which each representative's vote is
not recorded - and House Demo-
crats were not expecting the pro-
posal.
"This was part of a huge bill
and this was one last little add on
that (Republicans) threw in there,"
Irwin said. "I don't suspect they're
concerned about what gay people

or gay families think about their
political agenda."
Irwin said the amendment is
unlikely to pass in the Senate or
even Gov. Snyder, who, according to
Irwin, is not focused on "pursuing
social conservatism."
Despite the apparent need for
conservation of state funds, Irwin
said it's doubtful that the provision
will improve finances for the state
if it is enacted.
"Obviously if you take away
benefits from employees you're
going to save money, (but) that
money won't be saved for the state,"
Irwin said.
University alum Gilia Smith,

who is writing a dissertation
on health benefits for same-sex
partners at universities, said her
research has shown an increasingly
hostile environment for gays and
lesbians since gay marriage was
banned in Michigan.
She said new co-habitation and
age requirements put in place by
universities make fewer same-sex
couples eligible for health care ben-
efits. To comply with the law and
remain competitive, universities
opened up access to health care to
unmarried heterosexual couples as
well.
Smith added that while it is
currently legal for a public univer-

sity to provide benefits to unmar-
ried couples in the form of an
"other designated beneficiary" pro-
gram, the law does not require that
colleges do so.
Although universities are given
these options, Smith said elimi-
nating health care coverage for
unmarried couples would be detri-
mental to both the state's economy
and the advancement of gay rights.
"(Same-sex partner benefits)
send an important signal to the gay
and lesbian community that this is
an open and inclusive environment,
and it maintains all of the Universi-
ty's recruitment edges in the state,"
Smith said. "It gives them the abil-

ity to compete for international tal-
ent in (the) academic labor market."
Irwin said the University's
desire to retain itscompetitive edge
might mean a lawsuit in the near
future if the budget passes in the
Senate and that he "would assume"
the University would pursue
legal action if the benefits of some
employees were compromised.
"The University wants to com-
pete for the best and brightest
employees," Irwin said. "They're
spending lots of money on lawyers.
It could be many years before we
get a decision, (but) history is on
the side of people who believe in
equal rights."

FROM THE DAILY
Gi ve mea(tax) break
Film industry incentives must be maintained
n Thursday, a new bill was introduced in the Michigan
Senate that may save the state's film industry from Gov.
Rick Snyder's proposed budget cuts. Senate Bill No.
383, proposed by State Senators Mike Kowall (R-White Lake
Township) and Virgil Smith (D-Detroit), will preserve the film
credits that the Michigan Film Tax Incentives have provided
to filmmakers since 2008. This proposed bill could reverse one
of the many mistakes in Snyder's latest budgetary cuts, and the
Michigan Senate should pass it.

The absurdity of recent political
grandstanding in response to high
gasoline prices is quickly reaching
cosmic proportions, which tends to
happen when the collective thought
of our nation's representatives
struggles to fill a thimble. But what
an apt amount of cerebral activ-
ity it was! The legislation jammed
through the House of Representa-
tives by the Republican majority
over the past two weeks - legisla-
tion that not only reverses President
Obama's offshore drilling morato-
rium, but also calls for an expan-
sion of drilling into certain federal
waters - will amount to a thimble-
sized contribution of oil to our mas-
sive energy demand.
Apart from being completely
useless, the legislation also, holds
the distinction of having the most
puerile name in recent memory. It
consists of three bills titled "Put-
ting the Gulf of Mexico Back to
Work Act," "Restarting American
Offshore Leasing Now Act" and
"Reversing President Obama's Off-
shore Moratorium Act." Linguistic
concerns aside, the bills basically
serve to reopen the Gulf of Mexico
and other areas, such as the Atlantic
off the coast of Virginia, to oil drill-
ing. Proponents of these bills (most-
ly Republicans) cheerfully contend
that greater domestic production
will lower gas prices and decrease
our dependence on foreign oil.
Such a bold side-stepping of reali-
ty is nearly on par with the "theory"
of creationism and other infantile
beliefs. It conveniently ignores the
fact that oil is traded on a global
market. There is no chance of the
United States producing enough
oil to significantly shift the price of
a barrel and thus reduce gasoline
costs. And the notion that we can
reduce our dependence on foreign
oil by producing more at home is
equally ridiculous - the rnath just
doesn't work. According to the U.S.
Energy Information Agency, we
used just under seven billion barrels
of oil last year. The total amount .
of proven offshore reserves as of
2009 is a little over four billion bar-
rels, according to the same agency.
Even otr onshore reserves are scant
- a little over 16 billion barrels. In
case your intelligence has yet to be
insulted, the waters i n Virginia that
the legislation would lmake avail-
able for exploitation would yield a
six-day supply of oil, according to
the Departmentofsthe interior.

If it were just Republicans pan-
dering to the public's distaste over
the price of gas, there wouldn't be
much to worry about. Yet on Satur-
day, President Obama committed
another environmental blunder.
Even after acknowledging that
"there are no quick fixes to the
problem" of $4-a-gallon gasoline,
Obama went on to endorse drill-
ing in Alaska's National Petroleum
Reserve, "speed[ing] up the evalu-
ation of oil and gas resources in
the mid and south Atlantic" and
opening up the Gulf of Mexico to
new drilling leases, according to
his most recent YouTube address.
These steps supposedly "make
good sense." These steps actu-
ally contradict the administra-
tion's previous policies and make
absolutely no sense. Not only is
there much less oil than previously
thought in the National Petroleum
Reserve- (a 2010 estimate by the
United States Geological Survey
put the figure at a little under a
billion barrels), there is no extant
technologytoremediate an oil spill
in the arctic environment.
What are we to do in the face of
this blatant anti-intellectualism
and political gamesmanship? We
need to do something distinctly
un-American: We need to think.
According to an April CNN poll,
69% of Americans support the
expansion of offshore drilling. Con-
ceivably, this only gave more weight
to the irrational bills proposed by
members of the House of Repre-
sentatives and exerted more pres-
sure on President Obama to reverse
his previously sensible policies. It
is an irony of a supreme order that
the age of information in America
became the age of unreason. Simple
soundbites in the media, such as
"Drill, baby, drill!", influence mil-
lions. The sensationalistic accounts
of "Climategate" gave ammunition
to politicians and pundits and actu-
ally reversed a growing belief in
anthropogenic climate change in
this country. So let us be on guard
from letting our representatives
makesenseless and unscientific
decisions on our behalf. Let us be on
guard from refusing to think. There
was a time when the expression
"Only in America" conveyed a sense
of wonder and hope. Tdy it's a
euphemism for irrationanlity.
Will Grundler is a senior

According to a May 14 article
in the Detroit Free Press, the
new bill attenpts to adjust the
incentive program, replacing a
standard grant with an adjust-
able sliding scale. Currently,
the Michigan state government
guarantees filmmakers a flat tax
credit of 42-percent for their
production expenditures. By
using a sliding scale to grant tax
incentives, this new bill allows
the state to evaluate how much
revenue and how many jobs each
film project will bring in and
grant tax credits accordingly.
Though the bill does place lim-
its on the film industry, the cap
is much more reasonable than
Snyder's proposed limits. His
new budget plan puts a $25-mil-
lion limit on spending for the tax
credits, whichi tin' film industry
argues will drastically cut filn-n
ing in ine st . 'While tnyder
argues that this)reduction in 1ilm1
spending simply "levels the play-
ing field," in reality, these cuts

have the potential to destroy the
industry's presence in the state,
which would result in a substan-
tial financial blow to Michigan.
Though there has been signifi-
cant growth in the three years
since the inception of this pro-
gram, the state's film industry
is not established enough to
maintain the same level of busi-
ness without the tax incentives.
Michigan doesn't have the infra-
structure of Hollywood, and
without the economic advan-
tages, filrn businesses will leave
the state.
Since the beginning of the
program, Michigan has host-
ed more than 135 productions
and generated more than $649
million dollars, translating to
the creation of nearly 4,)00
jobs within the state. It's clear
that the tax incentive brought
an unprecedented amount of
business to Michigan since its
inception. What isn't clear is
how the state will make up for

the lost revenue under Snyder's
cuts. According to the May 12
Detroit Free Press article, "Oz:
The Great and Powerful" will
start filming in August and will
generate an estimated $105 mil-
lion for the state and employ 257
state residents.
Snyder's proposed cuts to the
film tax credits directly conflict
with his goals of making Michi-
gan a loss-tax environment that
welcomes businesses. On March
28, the state House approved a
$1.7 billion tax cut - a move Sny-
der called critical to Michigan's
economic reinvention. If Snyder
plans to import business to the
state through tax breaks, it's
illogical for him to cut the film
incentives.
if the state Senate wants to
boost Michigan's econonn, Sen-
ate Bill No. 383 should e passed.
The fhn nidustry has proved to
ie a vitA player in the reinven-
tion of M ichigaiin and its econoin-
ic potential shouldn't be stifled.

WILL GRUNDLER

0 I was driving back home from
Detroit last week after a day at the
Tigers game. Sitting in the back
seat with a car
full of friends, I
looked out the
window at the
houses that lined
Grand Avenue
just south of
Interstate 94 and
thought to myself MAX
how incredibly LEVENSTEIN
lucky I am to not
live in such pov-
erty. House after house was van-
dalized, abandoned, boarded up,
burnt down - you name it. I feel
lucky because I will graduate from
an excellent university, most likely
earn a decent salary, fulfill many
of my dreams and not have to con-
stantly worry about crime in my
neighborhood,but thesame cannot
be said for many in this country.
I turned to my friend sitting
beside me in the car and mentioned
these thoughts. She agreed and also
feels lucky that she has been able
to grow up comfortably, both of
us realizing that poverty severely
limits many opportunities for suc-
cess. This friend is the same person
who I had a discussion with about
income inequality in America just
a week earlier. I had just finished
my political philosophy paper on
the moral justifications of income
transfers from the rich to the poor.
I'll spare you the details of the
argument, but I asked her, "Why
does a man deserve to be poor just
because he is unlucky enough to be
born into poverty?" Considering
the question, she told me that it may
be unfortunate that he is unlucky
and poor, but that's the way it is.
Did a week change her views
of poverty in America? Absolute-
ly not. Rather, it was her small
glimpse of poverty passing through
Detroit. Talking with residents
or actually living there may have
enhanced her experience, but just
taking in the view as we passed by
was enough to influence her atti-
tude toward poverty.
Every day there are political
debates about welfare, health care,
illegal immigration and the wars
overseas. But the people debating
the issues are stuck in the world
of politics and theoretical policy.
Republican members of Congress
fight every word of welfare leg-
islation, but would they think
differently if they experienced
poverty? My guess is yes. With
the Sparknotes for Adam Smith

in hand, they religiously praise
the free market and small govern-
ment. But if these people actually
lived in the poverty they refuse to
help alleviate, they would realize
that the free market often fails to
benefit everyone and leaves many
in unfortunate situations. They
would see that the poor are not
poor because they are lazy or stu-
pid, but often times because they
were not given an equal chance to
succeed. They would realize that
the poor are people, not a spe-
cial interest group that wishes to
destroy capitalism.
Politicians
need a fresh
perspective.
This idea must be applied to more
than just welfare. How can politi-
cians argue about war when they
have never experienced it firsthand?
How can they debate illegal immi-
gration when they have never met
an immigrant and listened to their
story? The fact is, politicians must
expand their experiences in order
to make good and informed deci-
sions and not just rely on what their
rationality tells them. This should
not just apply to our Congressmen,
but to all who have an opinion. It is
not enough to read newspapers or
listen to punditry on television to
make an opinion. There is no way to
form a complete understanding of
anything simply from hearing oth-
ers speak about it. You must change
your perspective and enter into real
experiences to develop fair opinions
of others and their desires.
I am not espousing that we
become communists or allow an
open door policy for all immi-
grants, but learning from indi-
viduals and their experiences can
assist our policymakers in making
truly representative and effective
decisions. Let's not be afraid to
separate from cold logic and move
closer tothe warmthofcompassion
for others. We ought to reevaluate
the conventional wisdom about
economics, politics and people to
improve our understanding of the
important decisions we make in
the future.

East Quad is home to the Resi-
dential College, commonly known
as "The RC." If you aren't familiar,
the Residen-
tial College is
"one of the lon-
gest running
undergraduate
living-learning
communities
in the United
States," accord-
ing to its VANESSA
website. It is RYCHLINSKI
certainly an
interesting com-
munity with perhaps overly-strong
liberal arts academics - only in the
RC can a student enroll in courses
that teach Afro-Cuban drumming,
Javanese dance or Slavic cinema.
Denizens of East Quad are
known as "RCers." They sport
multi-colored hair in a variety of
styles and are vintage stores in
human form. You may even spot
one resident in a sombrero, known
by his alter-ego appellation "Pan-
cho Villa." Famed for once housing
the Unabomber on the third floor,
the building features live music in
the basement and free art exhib-
its, plays and yoga classes. It's a
place where you can't throw a rock
without hitting a girl, and where
straight boys are a hot commod-
ity. East Quad, the best location on
campus. East Quad, where every
kind of person iswelcome.
Well, not every kind.
In the program, it is mandated
that a student lives in East Quad
for two years. This is impractical
for many people due to financial or
health-related reasons, so a student
may be forced to beg to live else-
where for their second year. If one
can provide sufficient proof of such
a reason, then the office will issue a
waiver, though they are notorious-
ly hard to receive. Last year a cyni-

cal RC peer told me that if I didn't
live out of state, I was screwed.
Discouraged by this information
and unorganized as usual, I never
got around to obtaining "proof" for
my reasons.
At the end of my freshman year,
however, a friend told me a secret:
You can move out while remaining
in the program if you just "go talk
to them." I decided to try it. In the
RC office I was prompted to explain
why I wanted to live elsewhere. To
my surprise, I was rewarded with
a smile and a computer override. In
mere minutes I had accomplished
what was supposedly impossible
- apparently the need for cheaper
housing was a good enough reason.
At the outset of the fall semes-
ter, I learned that for most of my
sorority friends, the impossible had
remained as such. In order to stay
in the RC and also complete the
required year in the sorority house,
several had submitted waiver
forms. Others had even employed
the additional method of simply
talking to the gatekeeper in the
RC office. In both cases, the girls
were denied. Apparently, living the
Greek life was not only considered
a banal excuse, it was also suffi-
cient grounds to dismiss them from
the program iftheydidn'tfulfillthe
two-year requirement.
To be quite honest, I don't really
care about this small disparity.
It's more of a snub than a real hin-
drance, considering most classes
in East Quad are pretty accessi-
ble. What's more, those in Greek
life have their own social club to
belong to and be welcomed by. If
that's your cup of tea, go ahead and
drink it. I find it interesting that
sombrero-wearing muchachos are
encouraged and those of Omega
Toga Whatevers are objects of
disapproval. I even had a profes-
sor that often condemned those

who were members of sororities
and fraternities for not possessing
enough individuality.
Every person
isn't welcome
in the RC.
In a place where differences
are encouraged, it's interesting
that it's possible to not be "differ-
ent" enough. However, despite
the "Revenge of the Nerds" style
poetic justice, I do think that if
the aim is to create a place that is
welcoming to all, then the place
should welcome everyone, with-
out exception. Despite theirslight-
ly embarrassing choices in rain
boots or game-day activities, frat
boys and sorority girls are prob-
ably real people with souls and
everything. Think of the good we
could accomplish through assimi-
lation! We could familiarize them
with Value World, teach them
apathy regarding the direction of
the "masses", nourish them prop-
erly with seitan and soybeans, and
finally, convert them to the reli-
gion of Pitchfork and NPR.
In all seriousness, the RC prides
itself on being a haven for the
diversity of its members: devi-
ants, artists, language geeks, the
occasional physicist, social and
political thinkers, world travelers,
writers, crazies like my dear Pan-
cho and, of course, me. If your fla-
vor of nuts includes neatly labeling
yourself with a lettered t-shirt, you
shouldn't be excluded.

vidually, and t also met with a
group of abouc 48 studencs to
talk about che issues in greacer
depth."
According to Caminker,
Portman had a chance to speak
withastudents of the LGST corn-
munity before che commence-
ment ceremony to hear their
concerns, in which they had a
"very honest, respectful con-
versation."
"Senator Portman said he
appreciated the opportunity to
hear from the students direct-
ly, and the students expressed
their respect for his agreement
to meet with them and listen to
their views," Caminker wote.
Caminker added that Port-
man commented on the walkcout
during his address by illustrat-
ing that it was an example of
students exercising their free-
dom of speech, a right he feels
important for all citizens.
"tIn Senator Poreman's com-
mencement remarks, he under-
scored the important role that
lawyers serve to uphold the
rule of law, including important
tenets such as the First Amend-
ment," Caminker wrote.
According to Caminker, the
walkout has opened the door to
new erudition for the Univer-
sity.
",The internal conversations
that were sparked within the
student body, with me, and with
Senator Portman created an
important learning moment for
many members of the commu-
nity," Caminkcer wrote, "This
all strikes me as consistent with
the mission of our great public
University."
Caminkere wrote the situ-
ation was a valuable experi-
ence as it taught him how to
effectively communicate with
students and the importance of
keeping "the channels of com-
munication open."
Sn the e-mail he sent to the
graduating students, Caminker
apologized for any "distress"
that the selection may have
caused.
"The Law School remains
steadfast in its commitment to
create a supportive environ-
ment for our LOST community,
and also to create an education-
al environment in which diverse
viewpoints can be represented,"
he wrote. "Anything less would
undermine the Law School's
core values."

RAIL .
From Page 2
Sern Michigan.
"Any time people have choices in
transportation, it's a good thing,"
he said. "And with gas prices climb-
ing, I think that this just helps peo-
ple have choices."
Hoeffner added that the short-
age of funds forces the administra-
tors to be fiscally cautious because
even with the addition of federal
funds, upwards of $30 million are
still needed to improve signaliza-
tion and build sidetracks.
"When you have funding chal-
lenges it makes you think a little
harder on every investment that
you make and it helps you priori-
tize those investments better and I
thinkultimatelythat's important,"
he said.
Carmine Palumbo, director of
transportation programs for SEM-
COG, said in order to successfully
achieve the goal of building high-
speed rail throughout Southeast
Michigan, multiple steps must first
occur.

One way the plan attempts to
address congestion at the busy
Dearborn-Detroit corridor will be
the West Detroit Connection Track
Project, which involves creating
additional tracks to separate freight
trains and passenger trains. This
portion of the project has already
been allocated funds, and MDOT
plans to begin work this summer.
Upon completion, the project is
expected to reduce travel time in
the area by five to ten minutes.
Train cars are also in the process
of being renovated and SEMCOG
hopes to receive Federal Railway
Administration approval of the
seats by the end of May or early
June, Palumbo said. FRA approval
would allow for mass production
and installation of the seats, he
said.
Palumbo said since the goal of
running four roundtrips on week-
days is contingent on operating
funds, there is no set timeframe in
which the railway is expected to be
operational, adding that progress
on the rail has been slow because of
this uncertainty.
Despite budget constraints,
SEMCOG hopes to be able to soon

provide transportation to events
such as University football games
and the Thanksgiving Day parade,
and their goal is for these "event
trains" to be running by the end of
the year, according to Palumbo.
"The project continues to move
forward - not as quickly as any of
us would have liked - but nonethe-
less, we're going forward as best
we can, accomplishing all the tasks
that need to be accomplished," he
said.
City Councilmember Sabra Bri-
ere (D-Ward 1) agreed that the rail-
way would be a great addition to
regional public transportation.
"Whether (commuters) are tak-
ing the bus or the train is a decision
each person would make but I'd
like both options to be available,"
she said.
Briere said the majority of the
budget is controlled by the state
and federal levels of government,
and that the city of Ann Arbor has
very little to do with any financial
decisions.
"Unfortunately, a lot is depen-
dent on things that the city has
absolutely no control over," she
said.

'U' Hospital treats rare
neurological disorder

Researcher to join elite Academy

National Academy of
Sciences will induct
'U' researcher in April
ByKATE HUMMER
For the Daily
University neuroscience
researcher Huda Akil will join
the ranks of Albert Einstein,
Thomas Edison, Orville Wright
and Alexander Graham Bell with
her recent invitation into the elite
National Academy of Sciences for
her groundbreaking discoveries
related to sensory experiences and
emotions.
Akil - who serves as co-director
of the University's Molecular &
Behavioral Neuroscience Institute
and was named the Gardner C.
Quarton Distinguished Professor
of Neurosciences in the Depart-
ment of Psychiatry at the Univer-
sity's Medical School - has been
researchinghow brains biologically
process pain, depression, stress and
substance abuse. She will be among
72 other researchers granted mem-
bership to the NAS program next
April.
Akil said the University has

greatly aided her and her team by
supporting their endeavor to iden-
tify and develop research involving
the use of endorphins to actively
inhibit pain.
"My home department, psy-
chiatry, has been generous to us in
many ways, including supporting
our quest for understanding fun-
damental brain biology even when
it was unclear how it would have
clinical implications," Akil said.
Currently, Akil co-directs the
University's branch of the Pritzker
Neuropsychiatric Research Con-
sortium - an association dedicated
to finding genes and neurobiologi-
cal processes that may cause psy-
chological disorders such as major
depression, bipolar disorder and
schizophrenia.
Akil elaborated on her ongoing
research, which attempts to devel-
op increased collaboration between
biological research of brain-related
disorders and clinical applications
of the findings.
"Throughout my career, I have
been interested in how the funda-
mental knowledge that we acquire
about the brain might be used to
help people who are suffering from
brain-related disorders," Akil said.
"I believe that there is no greater

burden on us humans than when
our brains are not functioning well
- regardless of whether this affects
our senses, our movements, our
thoughts or our feelings."
While Akil said she is proud of
her contributions to the research,
she would also like to share the
credit of her election to NAS with
her fellow researchers.
"I am very honored by this elec-
tion, but I am also very mindful of
the fact that there are many other
scientists at the (University) and
beyond who are equally deserv-
ing of it," she said. "I also am very
grateful to many people who really
own a big part of it ... I feel that I
am simply representing a great sci-
entific team that brings together
people from all parts of the world
working together towards common
. goals."
Akil said that beyond the accom-
plishment of her invitation into the
NAS,sheviewstheexperienceasan
opportunity to extend her research
to a broader scientific community
and to the general public.
"In the end, the greatest reward
possible would be that our discov-
eries will actually help real people
improve their lives and alleviate
their suffering," she said.

Student recieves
world-renowned
treatment through
UMHS
By MARY HANNAHAN
Daily StaffReporter
Jackson Community College
sophomore Ryan Smith is your typ-
ical 20-year-old college student -
he attends classes, hangs out with
friends, works out at the gym - but
the scar running down the back
of his head reveals his struggle
against the neurological disorder
known as Chiari malformation.
When Smith began experi-
encing bizarre symptoms, such
as crippling headaches, out-of-
body experiences, numbness and
extreme anxiety in early 2009,
his doctor diagnosed him with
migraines and depression. Smith's
mother had the suspicion that he
was using drugs, but when treat-
ment didn't alleviate the extreme
symptoms, his doctor suspected
something else mustbe the cause.
After living with his illness and
being bedridden for two months,
Smith was diagnosed with Chiari
malformation, a condition where
the indent at the base of the skull
is abnormally small, resulting in a
fluid blockage between the brain
and spinal cord. Ryan was referred
to the University of Michigan
Health System and treated by Dr.
Karin Muraszko, a specialist in
pediatric neurosurgery and a
renowned expert on Chiari mal-
formations.
Muraszko determined that Chi-
ari malformation was the cause of
Ryan's crippling symptoms and
performed a decompression sur-
gery on him in April 2009. During
the surgery, Muraszko removed a
portion of the skull at the base of
the back of the head, which creates
room for fluid to flow between the
brain and spinal cord. Muraszko
said she was able to help Ryan
because of the unique capabilities
of UMHS's Department of Neuro-
surgery.
According to Muraszko, hos-
pitals typically need to send their
patients to various locations in
order to consult different spe-

cialists - but at the University of
Michigan Hospital all of the spe-
cialists are located in one place.
"He really required the exper-
tise of a wide variety of people
within the children's hospital and
within the neurosurgery depart-
ment to finally come to an under-
standing of what he had and how
best to treat it," she said.
Ryan's mother, Catherine
Smith, said she felt fortunate that
they were able to see an expert in
Chiari malformation so close to
their home of Jackson, Michigan.
After consulting a neurosurgeon
in Utah, who would have been
able to operate on Ryan sooner,
the physician told Catherine Smith
that her son would be better off
waiting for Muraszko to perform
the surgery because she is a world-
renowned specialist in the field
and had spent a significant amount
of time researching the illness.
"I can't even imagine there
being a better neurosurgeon for
that issue he had," Catherine said.
"I love Dr. Muraszko because she
reminds me of Dr. House - she
just doesn't hold anything back."
Ryan said he has not experi-
enced any headaches since the
surgery and that Muraszko made
him optimistic about his recovery.
"She pretty much gave me the
hope that I would get better, and
she was the one who recognized
what I had," Ryan said.
However, he said he suffers
from the anxiety that his condition
will come back - a common fear
he says exists among individuals
who undergo brain surgery to treat
a condition.
"I just thought headaches were
normal," he said. "I felt so much
better after the surgery, and I
wanted to go out and do stuff
because I felt so much better."
Catherine said the transforma-
tioninhersonwasmiraculous, and
that it changed his entire personal-
ity.
"It was like he was re-birthed at
seventeen and became a complete- '
ly different person," she said.
While Ryan used to be reclusive
and anti-social, Catherine said that
after the surgery he became more
outgoing and open with others.
"I give Dr. Muraszko all the
credit for giving me my kid back,"
she said.

Vampiric but dull 'Priest'

Okkervil successfully
grTows darkher in tone

By MACKENZIE METER
DailyArts Writer
"Priest" seems to be a film that
promises one thing and gives
another. See, "Priest" is not about
priests, per se. It's actually more
about vampires, but those aren't the
vampires we know either. Instead
of their sparkly,
attractive, book- **'%

ibly violent and
excrete some kind of slime with
which they build their dwellings.
While filled with disappointingly
unbloody thrills and lacking that
little bit of extra "oomph" from
practically nonexistent character
development and a weak back-
ground, the film commands atten-
tion and anchors audiences to their
seats.
Viewers will get sucked in quick-
ly by a violent openingscene includ-
ing the kidnapping of Lucy (Lily
Collins, "The Blind Side"). Spurred
into action by the kidnapping of his
niece, a former warrior priest (Paul
Bettany, "The Da Vinci Code") who
defeated the vampire menace of the
past is once again called into action,
not by the strange, futuristic other-
worldly adaptation of the Catholic
Church, but by the God he serves.
The film seems to take place on
another planet - which happens
to be beautifully represented - and
portrays the Church as a corrupt
hierarchy that is blind to the rise of

the vampires. It tries a little too hard
to make a statement about absolute
power corrupting absolutely and
how man-made institutions never
work in the long run, making some
of the lines describing the Church
and the situations redundant and
annoying. The Church is an exact
remake of the Church on Earth,
making viewers wonder why the
writers weren't more creative with
the script. But what the film lacks in
intelligence it makes up for in brute
strength and action.
The fast pace of the movie and
the obnoxious lines following
approximately the structure of
"If we do this, we'll achieve that
result," keep audiences staring at
the screen without needing to won-
der what's going on because it's so
clearly spelled out. Without the
pitfall of an action movie that lacks
a clear point, audiences are free to
jump when the vampire swoops in
from nowhere and to grip their seats
when the characters seem about
to die. These occurrences are deli-
ciously predictable so even the most
squeamish viewer will feel comfort-
able because of the ample warning
of ensuing violence.
It's relatively easy to diagram
the characters: Lily Collins plays a
damsel-in-distress with stale lines
asking what her captors want from
her. She's pretty convincing, but
it would have been nice to see her
character developed a little bit more.
Hicks (Cam Gigandet, "Burlesque"),
her heartthrob, plays - sexily but
dumbly - the role of Prince Charm-
ing with few acting chops. Or
maybe his problem lies in the lines
he's given. Whatever his problem,

his lines sound forced and, well,
scripted. Priest is the dark, brood-
ing one. Bettany plays this role well
and convincingly. His nemesis is
the black-hatted vampire/human in
charge of the whole vampire resur-
gence, someone who is appropri-
ately named Black Hat (Karl Urban,
"Star Trek"). He's probablythe least
important main character, but his
role is the best-played and therefore,
the most memorable. The other sup-
porting characters add a little bit of
extra action, but they mostly seem
to be placeholders.
All in all, this is a solid film. It's
not that smart, but it's well done
from a cinematography standpoint
and the effects are top-notch. With
a little bit more attention paid to the
script, this film could have emerged
as a good all-around experience
instead of a shoddily-scripted movie
about vampires and priests.

set or drops .
you into a tiaawar
boot-stomping
basement full of neon lights and
beautiful faces - either way the
hammering oflove is relentless.
lAm VeryFar, Okkervil's sixth
full-length album, departs from
their previous records, as it is
less of a holistic statement and
more a collection of eleven dis-
tinguished, bloody, blossoming
tracks driven out of lead singer
and songwriter, Will Sheff.
The depth and tender, mys-
terious integrity that is obvi-
ous in Okkervil's latest work is
supported by the knowledge
that Sheff shared in an inter-
view with Pitchfork: "I went to
stay with my grandparents for a
while. They live out in the mid-
dle of nowhere and I would have
breakfast with them, then write
all day. At nightwe'd have dinner
and cocktails, my grandfather
would tell me his World War
II stories, and then I'd start the
process all over again."
The record is cracked open
into excellence (handclaps, syn-
copation and a gunshot) with
opening track "The Valley." A
hip hop semblance conquers this
song as Sheff throws down "We
were fallen on the border with
the rock and roll singed. Times
ten" - his rap-like-delivery
synchs up with the power-driven
bass.
"Rider," presently No. 1 on
Okkervil River's iTunes page,
propels the forceful energy of
I Am Very Far and masters the
slightly predictable but incred-
ibly satisfying catchy-rock of
Springsteen - lyrical repetition
mastering the pound.
"We Need a Myth" succeeds
as piano melodies, brief shreds
of electric guitar and strings

conjoin with vividly dark lyrics
like "Show me the world as it was
again/As it was in a myth /A red
ribbon to reconnect / The lady's
head to her neck / And to forget
that her throat / Was ever slit."
The punch of the majority of
tracks on their sixth LP is com-
plimented by the under-toned
"Mermaid" and "Show Your-
self," which share a sad and soft
instrumental environment.
"Show Yourself" orchestrates
itself into an eloquent and highly
dimensional song, minimalistic
drumming and vocals lofting
themselves into poignancy.
Within a 51-minute mix of
solemn shimmer, Sheff created
a singular slurred track, "Your
Past Life as a Blast,' that is lyri-
cally and atmospherically time-
less.
The shortest and arguably
most galvanizing song that these
fine Texas natives offer on their
latest record, "Wake and Be
Fine," was Okkervil fans' sneak
peek to the new sound when
the band performed live on Late
Night with Jimmy Fallon, fierce-
ly accompanied by the New Por-
nographers' A.C. Newman and
The Roots.
I Am Very Far is not a grandi-
ose statement, but not shy either.
Although the latest record
isn't making an obnoxiously
rebellious statement against the
prior albums that have brought
Okkervil River indie-rock fame,
it is a more loosely held togeth-
er LP than The Stand Ins. The
consequence that bounces from
this great abandon is that Sheff
and his six bandmates display a
temerity set gorgeously ablaze
in these loosened gaps that could
be criticized for lack of being a
concept-album.
Inaninterview withPitchfork
about I Am Very Far, Sheff said:
"I think there's something about
art where it should threaten
people and scare them and make
them feel uncomfortable ... I like
art that makes you a little wor-
ried."
Sheff's perspective radiates
a sincerity of sharpened edges
that shows in Okkervil's 2011
album. What listeners might be
most worried about is when their
eager ears and ardent souls will
be re-fed with fresh pounds.

"Now how can I kill Edward Cullen?"

of the consistent,
proven excel-
lence of their GamOf

*include a tremen- HBO
dous selection
of thespians, stunning produc-
tion values, enigmatic characters,
clever plot twists and a blitzkrieg

of bare breasts. And indeed, "Game
of Thrones" resoundingly delivers
on all these fronts.
Based on "A Song of Fire and
Ice," George R.R. Martin's series of
fantasy novels, "Game of Thrones,"
thrusts us into the action at the
fictional land of Westeros, where
the Hand of the King (the prime
minister) has died. King Rob-
ert Baratheon (Mark Addy, "A
Knight's Tale) convinces his child-
hood friend Ned Stark (Sean Bean,
"Lord of the Rings") to become
the new Hand, much to the ire
of the queen, Cersei Lannister
(Lena Headey, "The Sarah Connor
Chronicles") and her twin brother
Jamie (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau,
"New Amsterdam") who are qui-
etly making a power play for the
throne. On top of these internal
perils, the Targaryen family, who
Robertunseated in a rebellion, is
busy making strategic alliances in
exile, thirsty to reclaim the throne.
And oh yeah, a horde of mystical
woodland creatures are probably
going to come murder everyone
once the seasons change.

Needless to say, there's a
lot going on within "Game of
Thrones," and that's even exclud-
ing the dozens of crucial charac-
ters and subplots unmentioned
in the plot summary. It even begs
the question: Is such a sprawling,
labyrinthine story even capable of
being adapted for television?
The first episode certainly
didn't inspire much confidence,
introducing character after char-
acter and one new storyline after
another without any sense of con-
text - akin to walking into a play
in the middle of the first act.
But five episodes in, with all
the players established, "Game
of Thrones" has settled into an
impeccable groove: a hyper-seri-
alized structure demanded by a
narrative this dense. The episodes
now flow effortlessly from sub-
plot to subplot, shrewdly paus-
ing to allow tender moments and
extended dialogues, illuminat-
ing relationships that will predi-
cate the events to come. Take the
final scene of the third episode, a
lengthy sequence in which Ned

silently observes as his daughter is
trained in sword fighting. Beaming
with pride, Ned's simple expres-
sion encapsulates his boundless
love for his daughter, the kind of
scene that leaps a show from good
to great.
Adding to the greatness is the
bumper crop of captivating char-
acters that have metamorphosed
from their stock cocoons in the
initial episodes. Ned, the show's
de-facto protagonist, has had to
reluctantly place his duty toward
the king over the desires of his
family and himself. On the oppo-
site end of the moral spectrum is
Jamie Lannister (played by the
squarest jaw on television since
Josh Holloway), an avaricious,
murderous bastard that just can't
wait to be king and who has been
graced with motivations for his
nefarious deeds. But the magic
lamp in the Cave of Wonders has
to be Tyrion Lannister (Peter Din-
klage, "The Station Agent"), the
debaucherous dwarf brother of
Jamie and Cersei. Bursting with
charm, Tyrion compensates for his

vertical limitations with incred-
ible wit and surprising insight.
And of course, it's all very
pretty. HBO has quite obviously
thrown millions of dollars at this
production and the result is the
most lavish sets and costumes
since "Lord of the Rings" - one
can only simmer with anticipation
at how grand the inevitable battle
scenes will be.
Yet, these major expenditures
bring up a major concern. HBO has
anastyhistory ofcancelingdramas
thatwere too costly, no matter how
popular they were. "Deadwood"
was left unresolved and "Rome"
was rushed to the end, nearly ruin-
ing its legacy. Could a similar fate
befall "Game of Thrones" after
hours of emotional investment?
After a mild start, "Game of
Thrones" has reached its expected
excellence, more than living up to
the HBO name. Various characters
on the show ominously proclaim,
"winter is coming," and as we
delve into summer, don't miss out
on what winter in Westeros will
entail.

The Michigan men's tennis
team has seen its share of success
in Durham, N.C. In January, the
Wolverines split a pair of matches
against Virginia Tech and Duke.
Michigan returned a month later
to upset then-No. 6 Duke.
This time, the Wolverines' trip
to Durham was with their season
on the line. In order to see the Blue
Devils for the third time this sea-
son, Michigan needed to beat No.
44 Maryland first on Friday. And
Michigan couldn't overcome a
strong effort from Maryland, fall-
ing 4-2 in the NCAA first round.
The Wolverines didn't get the
start they wanted - dropping the
doubles point once again. The No.
2 duo of sophomores Evan King
and Chris Cha started the day
with a victory. But the No. 3 team
of freshman Barrett Franks and
senior Chris Madden fell, leaving
the doubles point in the hands of
senior Jason Jung and freshman
Shaun Bernstein.
Despite falling behind early,
Jung and Bernstein clawed back
to 6-S in the pro-set before fall-
ing 8-6. Had Jungwonthe doubles
match, he would have inched one
win closer to the 90-win plateau
for first all-time in Michigan his-
tory. Instead, Jung's win total
stalled at 88.
The loss at No. 1 doubles gave
the edge to the Terrapins, who
clinched the doubles point and the
early 1-0 dual-match lead.
"Maryland played well and
it's in some way a little replica or
microcosm of our season," Michi-
gan coach Bruce Berque said. "We
lost doubles, and that's been fairly
difficult in most of the matches we
played, and it catches up to you
when you lose doubles over and
over again."
As singles got underway, the
Wolverines started just as theyhad
all season. At No. 1, King jumped
out to an early first-set lead, cruis-
ing to a quick two-set win to knot
the dual at 1-1. King's victory gave
him win No. 28 in his second year.
on the heels of King's finish,
freshman Justin Rossi was able
to take control of the second set,
sending his match to a third set at
No.6. But Cha was unable to do the
same, as he fell in straight sets at

No. 5 singles, surrendering a lead
to Maryland in the dual.
But the Terrapins wouldn't
have the lead for long. Bernstein
tied the dual at two by finishinghis
strong straight-set match at No. 3
singles.
"It was 2-2 for a while, and then
hard fought on froln there," King
said. "Everyone was doing what
they possibly could to win and it
was just a battle overall."
Ahead 5-4 in the final set, Jung
appeared to have a stranglehold on
the match. But John Collins fought
off Jung to tie the second set at 5
games. Collins went on to win the
next game, shifting the pressure
back to Jung, and one game away
from sending the match to a third
set. While Jung was fighting to
clinch his match, Rossi dropped
his third set in decisive fashion,
sending Maryland on top again.
This time, the Terrapins were only 
one match away from advancing.
"For a little bit, it looked like we
were in pretty good position, but
there were a couple unlucky shots
here and there," King said.
For Michigan to advance to the
second round, Jung and FranksE
had to win their singles matches.
But winnig both matches seemed
a daunting task for the Wolverines,
as Franks was trailing in his third
set by a break and Jung lost the last
two games of the second set.
Jung and Franks wouldn't go
away quietly, though. Franks
stormed back to tie the set 4-4 and
Jung jumped out to a quick 3-0
lead in the third set. Despite win-
ning three straight games, Franks
dropped the ninth game of the set,
falling 5-4. At No. 4, Sergio Wyss
propelled Maryland to the next
round with a three-set thriller,
ending Michigan's rollercoaster
season.
"There weren't big differences,
they just won the last momentum6
swing," Berque said. "There were
a lot of (turning points) and I can't
really point to one moment, but
we weren't able to capitalize on
opportunities."
The Terrapin victory ended
not only the Wolverines' season,'
but also their hopes of another
rematch with Duke, and their
hopes of reaching the Sweet 16,
something that had been a team
goal since the beginning of the
season.

Wolverines set to host NCAA Regional as No.10 seed

By EMILY BONCHI
Daily Sports Writer
The No.2 Michigan softballteam
has officially arrived at the most rig-
orous part of its journey in hoping to
reach the Women's College World
Series for the 10th time in program
history.
"The most exciting thing we do is
play in the NCAA tourney," Michi-
gan coach Carol Hutchins said to
her team after the announcement
Sunday night. "Nobody's ranking
matters. Now we play. The team that
plays the best wins."
The Wolverines were announced
as the No. 10 overall seed during
Sunday night's NCAA Selection
Show, set to host the Ann Arbor
Regional this weekend.
"I predicted somewhere between
seven and 11," Hutchins said. "And
I don't care - I don't. The ranking
doesn't matter, we've seen that the
last three years (when) we've been

ranked in the top eight."
The Wolverines (18-2 Big Ten,
51-4 overall) will welcome three
familiar teams to Ann Arbor, as
the double-elimination playoff
series begins Friday. Kentucky and
Notre Dame will be the first to take
the field, followed by Michigan -
matched up against in-state rival
Western Michigan.
The Wolverines have already met
the Fighting Irish (March 19) and
Broncos (April 12) this season, tak-
ing the games 9-4 and 6-1, respec-
tively. But a lot has happened since
then, and Hutchins looks to make
sure Michigan stays consistent.
"We just have to continue what
we've been doing, we don't have to
do anything different," Hutchins
said. "You always look at the brack-
et, see who you're with and who
you're paired up against. It's really
difficult to get to the World Series
because the top 16 is brutal."
She added: "I think it's a tough

regional, period."
Even as the final highlight reel
was playing on the big screen,
the Michigan coaching staff was
already collecting statistics on this
weekend's opponents.
Kentucky (14-9 SEC, 36-14) heads
to Ann Arbor after a tough loss to
Tennessee, the eventual confer-
ence champion, in the quarterfinals
of the SEC championship. But the
Wildcats have several big wins on
their resume, including a midseason
sweep of No. 3 Florida in April.
Notre Dame has been a con-
stant postseason opponent for the
Wolverines, as Michigan has been
matched up against the Fighting
Irish the past four seasons. Notre
Dame (19-1 Big East, 45-9) dropped
games to both Michigan and West-
ern Michigan this season, but went
on a 14-game tear in its last 15 games
of the season.
And the Wolverines' first oppo-
nent - the Broncos - earned an

at-large bid after winning the 2011
MAC Tournament title for the first
time since 2003. Western Michigan
(14-6 MAC, 25-28) claimed both the
MAC regular-season and tourna-
ment titles in the same season for
the first time in program history.
This is the 10th consecutive sea-
son that Michigan has hosted the
NCAA Regionals in 'Ann Arbor,
meaning the fourth straight home
series for this year's senior class.
"We've been blessed to be able to
host for four straight years," senior
first baseman Dorian Shaw said.
"We've got a great facility, and I
honestly think that when other
teams come in and play at Michigan
they're lucky to get to play at our
field, because our field is so nice and
our stands are always full."
Hutchins added: "(The crowd)
sure makes me fired up. I hope that
it's to our advantage - it certainly
could be. But they're not going to
pitch for us and they're not going to

hit for us, so we've got to give them
something to cheer about."
Just two other Big Ten teams,
Indiana and Penn State, join the
Wolverines in the tournament's
64-team pool. Michigan is the only
team in its conference to hold a
NCAA Championship title.
"I did my homework - I'm dis-
appointed in it, but that reflects our
seeding," Hutchins said of the lack
of Big Ten teams. "Our schedule
this year was lighter at the .front
end, more than I cared for it to be, so
that's the way it is. But we did what
we could do, we won the games that
we were supposed to win, so I think
we're in good shape."
The Wolverines will be gearing
up for postseason play this week as
the tournament starts Friday night.
Kentucky and Notre Dame will kick
off the evening at 5:30 p.m. followed
by Michigan and the Broncos at
8:00 p.m. Both games will be aired
on ESPN.

'M' sweeps Spartans to clinch fourth straight Big Ten title

Wolverines earned their fourth
straight conference title. After beat-
ing the Spartans on Senior Night on
Friday, Michigan was only guaran-
teed a share of the title.
"We're all kind of caught up in
wanting to win a Big Ten champion-
ship," senior first baseman Dorian
Shaw said. "That's what this game is
about, it's not about the seniors.
"We still have to play Michigan
State just like the sophomores and
the juniors and the freshmen do
too."
And they did, earning their 17th
run-rule decision of the season -
Michigan's sixth in Big Ten play.
On Saturday, Michigan (18-2 Big

honor this is," Carr said with misty
eyes. He recalled the humble begin-
nings of the connection between
the hospital and a football program.
"What Michigan athletics, Mich-

word," he was told by Dr. Valerie

money for Mott.

Former Michigan coach Lloyd Carr received a foundation in his name this weekend,
as well as learning that he was a 2011 inductee to the College Football Hall of Fame.

The new C.S. Mott Children's
hospital is scheduled to open this
November, and Carr remembered
thinking to himself five years ago,
"That will be one of the greatest
days in the history of the University
of Michigan."
He added: "All of those phenom-
enal doctors, and surgeons and
nurses, and all of the administrators
and people who make this place so
special, I say thanks."

Carr started his speech by
acknowledging his family, his wife
and three kids, and he ended it by
recognizing two mentors - the late
coach Schembechler and former
coach Gary Moeller, who was in
attendance - as well as the former
players in attendance.
"I wish coach Schembechler
could be here tonight because he
would be as excited as we are," Carr
said.
