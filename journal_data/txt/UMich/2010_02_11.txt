Slated to open in 2012, the The University will shoulder

around 78 percent - or $45 mil-
lion - of the projected $60 million
total cost, a Nov. 8 Michigan Daily
article reported. In exchange for
the funding, the University will
receive 78 percent of the total
number of parking spots, which it
will reserve for hospital parking.
Cooper said the center is in the
first phase of a long-term vision
that some regard as the future of
transportation in Ann Arbor. The
plan currently involves estab-
lishing east-to-west and north-

to-south commuter trains to
accommodate the roughly 75,000
people who make the daily com-
mute to the city from areas like
Ypsilanti, Detroit and Dearborn.
At yesterday's meeting, Cooper
said the Fuller station will serve
as "a major transit corridor" for
the city. He added that the center
will also be geared toward com-
muters who rely on bicycles and
will feature lockers and showers.

MVP announces president, VP
candidates for MSA elections

At mass meeting,
Margolis, Stuckey
say they want to
bring change to MSA
By ELYANA TWIGGS
Daily StaffReporter
The MichiganVisionPartyheld
its second mass meeting last night
to announce Ian Margolis and
Tom Stuckey as its presidential
and vice presidential candidates,
respectively, for next month's
MSA elections.
In addition to announcing the
candidates, the mass meeting

aimed to give information to stu-
dents who want to run as part of
MVP's executive slate. About 12
students showed up to the meet-
ing in Mason Hall last night.
Margolis, who was elected
internally by the party as its pres-
idential candidate, said he hopes
his leadership within the group
will attract new perspective
members to MSA. He added that
his experience as a current MSA
representative would help him if
he is elected to the post.
"We are beginning the process
to get the party moving," Margo-
lis said. "We really want to bring
in fresh voices."
Margolis said the way MSA
operates currently is ineffective

at promoting change, noting that
his record as a representative
indicates he's capable of taking
the assembly to the next level.
As a representative, Margolis
launched MSA Mondays, brought
University alumni who are White
House staffers to campus to talk
to students and was part of the
team that created the Block 'M' in
Michigan Stadium.
"This isn't about helping with
the campaign," Margolis said.
"This is about changing MSA."
"They don't accomplish any-
thing they say," he said of the
current MSA. "They sit and they
bicker about political issues in
general meetings."

Move is an effort
to cut costs,

By NEETHI SRINIVASAN
For the Daily
The Ann Arbor Area Cham-
ber of Commerce and the Ypsi-
lanti Area Chamber of Commerce
recently joined together in an
effort to create a more cost-effi-
cient organization that serves

businesses in the area struggling
with the difficult economy.
The merger was officially
announced on Dec. 18, but dis-
cussion of the partnership began
about five months ago during the
Community Success Program -
a joint event the leaders of both
chambers attended - according
to Mark Ouimet, the immediate
past chair of the newly combined
chamber.
Ouimet said the "great deal
of duplicate service" by both
chambers served as an impetus

for consolidating the respective
branches.
Diane Keller, president and
CEO of the new chamber, also
attributed the merge to the need
to streamline the chambers' ser-
vices.
"We're going to have one new
structure, which will be great for
the membership," Keller said.
Both organizations share the
similar goals of advocating for
and promoting local businesses.

Ballroom Dance Club

With Valentine's Day just
around the cutner, some are look-
ing to find a new skill to impress
their dates and one club on cam-
pus might be ahle to help.
Founded in 1999, the Universi-
ty's Ballroom Dancing Club is an
organization fur members of the
University and Ann Arbor com-
munities to learn traditional and
moudernoballroom dance styles.
Every Sunday, members of
the club gather in the Michigan
Union or the Michigan League
to learn dentin ranging from
the more traditional Foxtrot, the
Viennese Waltz, the Swing. and
the Cha-Cha to more modern
dance styles like Sals, Meren-
gut, and the Hustle.
Unlike the University's Ball-
room Dance Team, the Ballroom
Dance Club doesn't participate
io competitions, but instead
focuses on creating a relaxed and

social atmosphere fur its dancers,
according to Alice Huang, presi-
dent of the club.
"The Ballroom Dance Club is
exactly what its name implies:
a club," Huang said. "Expect to
have fun and learn new things;
it's recreational, notcompetitive."
Dancers of different levels
participate in the club, which is
always open to new members,
Huang said.
"The levels range from abso-
lutely beginner to very expe-
rienced," Huang said. "The
Ballroom Dance Club welconmes
all dancers, whether they are
searching for a dance venue, fur
learning opportunities, or simply
for a good time with fellow danc-
ers.
The weekly dance sessions
begin with large group lessons
taught by experienced instruc-
tots and end with two hours of

open dance where dancers can
practice their new skills, accord-
ing to Wenting Gun, the club's
vice president.
"As a newcomer, one could
expect a welcoming environment
fur learning and developing all
aspects of Ballroom, Internation-
al Latin, and American Rhythm
dancing," Gun said.
People with little experi-
ence can also participate-in the
"Beginner's Blitz" which occurs
at the beginning of each semes-
ter. At these sessions a new
dancer can learn the basics fur
many different dances to be bet-
ter prepared for future sessions,
Huang said.
One time each semester, the
club hosts a party that includes
members from other colleges,
which allows them to showcase
new dance skills, Huang said.

ial & Museum.
The images of the dust clouds
ising as high as some downtown
kyscrapers "are some of the most
xceptional images in the world, I
hink, of this event," Ramirez said.
ABC said the NIST gave the
etwork 2,779 pictures on nine

raphs had never been released
efore.
The network posted 12 photos

this week on its Web site, all taken

plane hit the south tower from the
helicopter.
"We didn't find one single per-
son. It was surreal," he told The
Associated Press on Wednesday.
"There was no sound. No sound
whatsoever, but the noise of the
radio and the helicopter. I just
kept taking pictures."
He took three rolls of film with
his Minolta camera, plus 245
digital shots. Semendinger said
he gave the digital images to the
9/11 Commission and believes

ith Michigan's economy in trouble and unemployment
high, research conducted in the state seems to be the
only area in which the state has been advancing. And
the opening of Michigan's University Research Corridor headquar-
ters in Lansing on Friday shows that research growth doesn't appear
to be slowing any time soon. The new facility will allow for further
collaborative research between the state's three main research uni-
versities. The opportunities stemming from the URC could be ben-
eficial not only to the University, but also to the improvement of the
state. Because the state's economy will increasingly rely on science
and technology, it is important that the URC continues to lead the
way in research.

Semester at the museum

As reported by the Daily on Friday, the
URC headquarters opened its doors this
week. The URC, formed in 2007, aims to
improve research opportunities by bring-
ing together the state's three major research
universities: the University of Michigan,
Michigan State University and Wayne State
University. With each participating institu-
tion bringing forth its own specialties and
research concentrations, the hope is that the
URC will facilitate collaborative advance-
ments in research and success for the state.
The opening of the headquarters comes
at an opportune time, since the University
of Michigan has just been awarded two
significant research grants from Google
totaling $425,000. The first grant, worth
$325,000, will be used to investigate how
large computer systems can better save
energy. The other $100,000 grant will help
University researchers concentrate on
developing energy efficiency hardware.
The research that the University of
Michigan, Michigan State and Wayne
State produce can have life-changing
effects. The University of Michigan has a
wealth of powerful research programs -
the computer technology that the Google
grants encourage are only one such pro-
gram. In particular, the University has
surged ahead in embryonic stem cell
research since the passage of a statewide
ballot proposal in 2008 that loosened strict
restrictions on the research in the state.
Stem cell research isn't simply an exercise

in academia - it has the potential to cure
debilitating diseases. And Michigan State's
agricultural research, along with Wayne
State's urban research, could have impor-
tant practical applications in food produc-
tion and community development.
But as much as isolated research is valu-
able, collaboration among the universities
could leadto even more breakthroughs in
science and technology. Through the URC,
researchers at the state's research univer-
sities can benefit from the cooperation of
the other two contributing research insti-
tutions. The sharing of knowledge would
hasten research progress and bring about
more technology that will make the world
a better place.
Increased university research will
also give the state a chance to tap into a
thriving economic resource. Michigan's
future economy, long dependent on the
automotive industry, lies in scientific and
technological advancements. Research
developments will encourage businesses
to make their home in Michigan, bringing
jobs to the state and encouraging a poten-
tially profitable economic sector.
The significant research developments
that begin at the URC and at the Univer-
sity can have real-world effects in science
and technology and can be a big boost
for the state's economy. The University
should continue to embark on collabora-
tive research that benefits this institution
and the state.

Sess you've been living in a
cave for the past few - I'm
sorry. That
phrase is becoming,
really overused,
isn't it? It's also
offensive, because
some people still
live in caves.
So unless you've.
been dead in a cave
for the past several
weeks, you've been
celebrating theW
current LSA theme GRUNDLER
semester. Wait -
you don't know
what the current
LSA theme semester is? You don't
CARE about the current LSA theme
semesterAnd your dog died in a cave
last week?
Well, I'm sorry. Not about your
dog, but about your failure to take
advantage of this semester's theme,
which is: old stuff. To be precise,
the theme is "Meaningful Objects:
Museums in the Academy," and it's
really been going on since last semes-
ter. To those readers who have vis-
ited the museums on campus already,
congratulations and proceed to the
crossword. Why are you reading this
anyway, since you go to museums and
just know everything, huh?
Ofcourse, alack ofknowledge and/
or interest concerning theme semes-
ters is more common. This is due to
three main reasons:
1. There is not enough publicity
about theme semesters.
2. Theme semesters can sometimes
be more boring than "The Notebook."
3. Maybe something to do with
MSA. Dang you, MSA!
Let's address the first two points.
It's true that there hasn't been much
of a media frenzy about "Meaningful

Objects," and we at the Daily would
like to apologize for that. We did final-
ly get around to publishing a nice arti-
cle about the Museum Studies minor
(Declaring Docent, 02/01/2010), but
that's only one article.
However, our sister paper The New
York Times has NOT been pulling its
weight, either. For instance, I searched
"Michigan Daily theme semester" on
its website and got zero articles for the
past month. Astonished, I searched
"Michigan Daily" and also got no
results. So I clicked "All Results Since
1851" for the Daily and got the shock-
inglylow figure 249. More articles have
been written about the dung beetle
(288). What gives, New York Times?
We write aboutyou!
Anyway, I'm trying to raise museum
awareness in today's column because
I'd hate to see "Meaningful Objects"
fall under point two from above. In
fact, when anyone says to me, "Before
graduating you need to (go to a hock-
ey game/go to Ashley's/get a life)," I
remind them that they need tovisit the
Exhibit Museum ofNatural History. Or
the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology. Or
the University of Michigan Museum of
Art. We have lots of museums on cam-
pus. There is even a dentistry museum.
You might want to skip the dentistry
museum, but still.
However, I have the suspicion
that many students regard muse-
ums as uncool, because you usually
can't drink beer, listen to rap music
or bench-press inside of them. But
that's just a stereotype! And vague
arguments aside - such as how they
give us the opportunity to "connect"
with our "past" and "learn" about
our "future," or are an essential part
of a "liberal arts education" - muse-
ums can simply be fun. At the Exhibit
Museum alone you can: 1) look at
dinosaurs, including a T-Rex, and

big mastodons, 2) learn that "mast-
odons" is Latin for "nipple-teeth," 3)
see a planetarium show and remem-
ber how utterly insignificant you and
your homework are in relation to the
universe and 4) make nipple-teeth
jokes.
"Mastodons" is
Latin for
"nipple-teeth."
At the Kelsey Museum of Archae-
ology you can look at treasure all day
long - and who doesn't like treasure?
And UMMA - well, UMMA is just
in a class by itself. There's just so
much art. Even if you don't like art,
there's art there for you. The best
part is feeling like you're in "Ferris
Bueller's Day Off."
So try to get to at least one muse-
um, because they're pretty under-
appreciated, and if this theme
semester doesn't generate more inter-
est in them, the University will begin
to tear them down. Okay, I made that
up, but one wonders how long a den-
tistry museum can last.
The point is, really, to think out-
side of your routine - your cave.The
University has many options. Take a
class on a subject you're unfamiliar
with. Attend a speech over the week-
end. Read The Michigan Review.
Well, no on that last one. Look, just
head over to the Exhibit Museum
to see some nipple-teeth before you
graduate, okay?

Coleman must sign climate pledge

The American Colleges and University Presidents' Cli-
mate Commitment is an organization that aims to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions and to promote research and
educational efforts on collegiate campuses across the
United States. Unfortunately, University President Mary
Sue Coleman has yet to join 667 other collegiate presi-
dents and declare her support to the organization. Since
the University is a large and highly regarded research
institution, it has a responsibility to sign and adhere to the
environmental commitments outlined in the ACUPCC. It
is imperative that Coleman signs the ACUPCC.
The University can easily accomplish the objectives of
the ACUPCC. Just as the University of New Hampshire,
one of the participants in the ACUPCC, has implemented
sustainability into their campus, the University of Michi-
gan can complete an emissions inventory, seta target date
for being climate neutral, reduce greenhouse gas emis-
sions and make sustainability part of the curriculum. It
also can make the action plan and progress reports pub-
licly available.
Though the University of New Hampshire is much
smaller than our university, their leading sustainabil-
ity efforts can be integrated at large institutions. Their
main objective is their CORE program. CORE stands for
curriculum, operations, research and engagement. The
University already has some operations and research in
place, but we are lacking in curriculum and engagement
departments.
Our university has the environment-friendly Dana
building, which holds environmentally conscious students
in it, but not all buildings across campus are so green, nor
are all students as eager to help the environment. With a
possible mandatory academic environment requirement,
more students and faculty would be engaged on campus.
Committingto ACUPCC might help the campus and cam-
pus buildings become more environmentally aware.
Moreover, the University is fairly environmentally con-
scious to begin with, so it only makes sense for President
Coleman to sign. For instance, just the fact that we have
both a graduate and undergraduate environmental stud-
ies program (SNRE and PitE) shows the University's lean-
ing toward sustainability efforts. PitE, in fact, is one of
the fastest growing majors on campus.

Furthermore, the University has created a Planet Blue
team. The teams are part of the Environmental and Ener-
gy Initiative, which came about from President Barack
Obama's Environmental Task Force. Planet Blue teams
consist of facility managers, plant operations personnel
and building representatives. The teams work with build-
ing representatives to reduce energy usage and increase
recycling. Coleman supports their efforts, saying on
their website that, "The University of Michigan takes
its responsibility of protecting and preserving resources
very seriously, and every contribution can make a dif-
ference. I challenge everyone in our community to think
about how even the smallest efforts will work to make our
great institution even greener."
Additionally, the University has begun green comput-
ing initiatives, according to the Detroit Free Press article
entitled "U-M saves energy, cash with green computing."
Things being done include handing down old equipment
and switching to systems that allow one computer to do
the job of multiple ones. Another green computing pro-
gram called Climate Savers Computing Initiative seeks to
cut computer energy consumption in half by 2010. This
would save the University $5.5 billion. With the Univer-
sity pursuing several environmental plans, the President
should sign onto something that will really cut our impact
on the environment.
Critics may urge the University not to sign, because if
the goals are not met, the University's prestigious repu-
tation could potentially be tarnished. While this may be
true, the University should still take every step to ensure
the goals are met. Critics might also claim the goals of the
ACUPCC will cost the University more money. But the
energy savings would outweigh any upfront costs. Uni-
versities are a breeding ground for sustainable-minded
youth who will lead our businesses and.organizations in
the future.
The ACUPCC is a cohesive, attainable commitment
that will really shape the future of campus sustainability
and sustainability for our cities, states and nations. By not
signing the commitment, Coleman would be making an
egregious error.
Angela Bozell is an LSA junior.

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Writer
For the Michigan hockey team's
defensive unit, this season has
entailed a lot of climbing.
After the team dug themselves
a hole early in the season, losing
seven of their first eleven games, the
19th-ranked Wolverines have tried
to climb out of it ever since. The
defense, starting with junior goalie
Bryan Hogan and extending out-
ward, has the led the effort.
But a large part of the early sea-
son digging was due to defensive
woes.
Soft goals, puck handling mis-
takes and miscommunication
between Hogan and the defense-
men cost them games against Bos-
ton University, Miami (Ohio) and
Michigan State (multiple times), all
teams under consideration for the
NCAA Tournament.
The most telling example came
near the halfway point of the season

against Ohio State. Despite giving
up just 20 shots, defensive lapses led
to a 5-3 loss and dropped them to
10th place in the conference.
"It's a game of mistakes," Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson said after
the December 4thloss. "If you make
mistakes in your own zone, you're
going to pay for them."
Tuesday night against Bowling
Green, it was a different unit than
the one that let up five goals to the
Buckeyes. On the first shot of the
game, Hogan kicked it out to a wait-
ing Falcon. This time, junior Chad
Langlais was there and cleared the
puck away. The Wolverines turned
away all ensuing shots, giving them
their third shutout in nine games.
After that game, Berenson was
singing a different tune than he had
two months before.
"We were able to not give up the
blue line as easy," he said.
The transformation isn't com-
plete and it doesn't even look appar-
ent. Michigan still hasn't found

its lineup. It continues to rotate
freshman Lee Moffie, sophomore
Greg Pateryn, and junior Tristin
Llewellyn in and out of the lineup.
Berenson has specifically pointed
to penalties as the reason Llewellyn
and, to a lesser extent, Moffie have
been sitting out games, giving
Pateryn an opportunity for play-
ing time. Pateryn has played just
19 games this season, but in recent
weeks has established a presence in
the lineup.
"There's always going to be guys
in and out," assistant coach Billy
Powers said. "It hasn't been week-
to-week, so guys have gotten a
chance to play with each other and
I think that's why it's been fairly
seamless."
The one place conversion is vis-
ible is on the stat sheet. After not
being ranked for the first time in
twelve years and limpingto an 8-8-0
start, Michigan has cut down their
goals against average by almost a
half of a goal in their last 15 games.

Cumulatively they are now fifth in
the country.
"It's been a concerted effort
by everyone," Powers said. "Our
defense have done a nice job of
standing up, helping each other, but
they're able to do that because the
forwards are coming back."
The stat sheet has been kind to
the defensemen on the other end
of the ice as well. After tallying just
three goals in the first half, the her-
alded offensive power finally sur-
faced.
In three of the last four series, a
defenseman has netted a goal, eight
total in the last month.
"Whether it's high-end assists
plays or getting shots through or
scoring goals, we're asking our
defense to be the fourth guy, getting
up in the rush. Powers said. "Being
smart, but being ready if we can
get over the blueline to contribute.
Then of course when we cycle the
puck and get it back to you, you have
to make aplay."

all depends on the defense State
decides to play.
"We have several man-to-man
zone offenses," Phillips said. "So
we could go either way. I could go
inside or outside, it just depends
on the flow of the game and who is
contributing from where."
The Spartans' tallest weapon,
Alyssa DeHaan, stands at 6-foot-
9, and Michigan will have to find a
way around her. If Michigan State
plays a zone defense, the Wolver-
ines will stay on the perimeter but
if the Spartans play man-to-man
they hope to get around DeHaan.
"We are focusing on getting
around the rim and trying to find
a way to get around her and just
making sure we capitalize when
she is outside of the lane and knock
down perimeter shots," junior
guard Veronica Hicks said.
Beyond a presence in the paint,
the Wolverines could look for suc-
cess from the 3-point line. Michi-
gan averages 35 percent from
downtown this season, but sopho-
more forward Carmen Reynolds
shoots 44 percent from beyond the
arc and could be a major weapon
for the Wolverines tonight if the
Spartans force them out of the
paint.
But as for stopping the Spar-
tans' attack in the middle and on
the perimeter, Michigan will need
to play tight man-to-man defense
to prevent a sweep for the second-
straight year at the hands of its
intrastate rival.
"That's going to be our key,"
Phillips said. "You're responsible
for your person and that's your job,
and if you get your job done and
all of the five players get their jobs
done, then we will get a job done."
As long as the Wolverines stay
on the ball, adapt when necessary
and prevent Michigan State from
gaining momentum, they could
avoid being swept by a Big Ten
team for the third time this season.

The Spartans aren't known for
playing zone defense, but the Wol-
verines watched as the defensive
strategy worked last time against
them.
So, the preparation was even
more necessary, as it would be no
surprise if the Spartans do it again
tonight.
To break that zone, the Wolver-
ines (6-7 Big Ten, 14-9) are going to
have to be versatile on offense.
Whatever style of defense
Michigan State (6-6, 15-8) decides
to impose, Michigan will have to
adapt.
. The key to that may be scoring
in the middle. At 6-foot-6, senior
center KristaPhillips is Michigan's
tallest player, and her position
as a post player or sharpshooter

the bicycling community of Ann
Arbor," Cooper said.
Both the Ann Arbor City Coun-
cil and the Ann Arbor Planning
Commission must approve the
design plan before construction
can begin, City of Ann Arbor Proj-
ect Manager Dave Dykman said at
the meeting.
Dykman estimated that con-
struction will begin next winter
andthat"some activityonthesite"
may begin as early as this spring.
He said the initial work would
include relocating both a sanitary
sewer and electrical transmission
line that currently traverse the
site.
"Construction is ongoing and
underway," Dykman said.
Cooper said the construction
of rail lines, which he calls "phase
two" of the project is meant to
reduce the total number of cars
entering and leaving the city by
providing an alternative mode of
transportation.
Cooper said 98 percent of Ann
Arbor's commuting employees
currently use "single-occupancy
vehicles." A rail service, he said,
MVP
From Page 1A
But Margolis said, through
* MVP, candidates would be able
to change MSA by focusing on
the needs of students.
"We are about delivering
tangible things to the students
and being upfront with them,"
he said. "We're not going to be
handing out flyers on the Diag
and saying: 'This is what we
stand for'."
Stuckey told students at the
meeting that MVP's main focus
is to "fight for our students."
Stuckey said one of his main con-
cerns, which he hopes to address
as vice president, is the high cost
of a college education.
"Everyone can complain about
how expensive college is," Stuck-
ey said. "We are lobbying with
other schools across the state
to decrease costs and increase
funding."
John Lin, message chair for
MVP, told students at the meet-
ing that the party is seeking out
students who are leaders in their
own communities.
"We are looking for people
who are involved ... people that
want to see student government
that does stuff for students," Lin
said. "People that want to see
us advocating for students and
enhancing the Michigan experi-
ence."
Lin said with a more "focused"
student government, MVP could
do "bigger and better things"
for MSA. He added that he
wants Michigan students to get
involved in MSA through MVP.
"We are very proud of what
we did this past year," Lin said.
"We are proud that we made it
transparent, accountable, and
have focused on students now."
MVP became a party last year
in the wake of the deterioration
of the Michigan Action Party,
which had been the dominant
party in MSA for a number
of years. In addition to MVP,

would change that.
"Folks, if given the choice, will
use these convenient, reliable
forms of transportation" instead
of driving, Cooper said.
Jim Kosteva, the University's
director of community relations
emphasized at the meeting that
a rail service could substantially
reduce Ann Arbor's carbon foot-
print.
Cooper echoed Kosteva's sen-
timent, saying that a transit sta-
tion "within walking distance"
of either the University's central
campus or downtown Ann Arbor
would not only appeal to commut-
ers but would also be environmen-
tally friendly.
The officials at the meeting
pointed out that though the devel-
opment of a railway system would
be ideal in terms of its accessibil-
ity and environmental impact, the
long-term plans will most likely be
postponed until the state's current
economic situation improves.
Coopersaidhe doesn'tsee phase
two of the project beginning for
"three to five years, at best."
- Rachel Brusstar
contributed to this report.
the reMichigan campaign also
formed at that time. Current
MSA President Abhishek Mah-
anti and Vice President Mike
Rorro are members of MVP.
LSA freshman Rebecca
Michael, who attended last
night's meeting, said she is con-
tent with how MVP conducted
business at the mass meeting and
with the choice of candidates.
"It was a really positive atmo-
sphere," she said. "They really
are working with the students to
change things. I have seen a lot
of students come together and
it makes the community bet-
ter, which is something-Ilike to
see."
LSA sophomore Bryan Hong,
who said he, attended the event
to learn more about MVP, said
he is still unsure if he wants to
run to be an MSA representa-
tive. Though he is on the fence,
he said he still supports MVP.
"Right now, I'm keeping my
options open," Hong said. "It's
always good to have a party that
is being held accountable for stu-
dents and constituents."

enter the race due to his cam-
paign's financial woes.
In.mid-January, Ilitch began
meeting with Democratic party
leaders, even making a trip to
Washington,D.C. tomeetwithoffi-
dals atthe White House, including
President Barack Obama.
Those who were supporting
Ilitch's run for the Democratic bid
believed she would be a good can-
didate because she is not affiliated
with the current administration
of Democratic Gov. Jennifer Gra-
nholm and because she has busi-
ness and.legal experience.
Ilitch is the former CEO and
president of Ilitch Holdings, Inc.,
the business that owns the Detroit
Red Wings, the Detroit Tigers,
Little Caesars Enterprises - the
pizza company founded by her
father, Michael Ilitch - and Olym-
pia Entertainment.
An alum of the University, Ilitch
is also of counsel at the Detroit-
based law firm Clark Hill PLC and
owner of Ilitch Enterprises and
Ambassador Magazine.
But despite yesterday's
announcement that she would not
seek the governor's seat this year,
Ilitch didn't rule out running for
office again in the future.
"Though I will not run for this
office now, I will keep the door
open to other opportunities, as I

The expansion, which started
several months ago, cost around
$125,000, and was done with the
intent to further satisfy their steady
customer base and attract more din-
ers.
"We have a lot of the same cus-
tomer base daily, and I hope theyare
a little happier because they have a
wider space," Silvio Medoro said.

believe that public service is the
highest calling," Ilitch said in her
statement.
State Rep. Alma Wheeler Smith
(D-Salem) and Lansing Mayor
Virg Bernero are the only two
Democratic candidates to have
officially entered the race thus far.
Smith announced her plan to run
for governor last summer, while
Bernero did the same earlier this
week.
House Speaker Andy Dillon
(D-Redford) has yet to officially
enter the race, though he formed

Ilitch's decision not to vie for the
governor's seat hasn't changed her
outlook on the race.
"I was in this race; I'm in this
race to go," Smith said last night.
"I have a strong vision for Michi-
gan and my experience helps me
understand when I make bold
moves how to keep the state in bal-
ance as we move forward with an
aggressive agenda for the state."
Banish also noted that the restau-
rant is one of the only pizzerias in
town that uses gluten-free crust and
pasta. She added that Silvio's pizzas
are like "snowflakes" because each
one is unique.
"Nobody opens a can here," she
said. "Everything is made from

vides its 400 member organiza-
tions with similar services.,
Ouimet said the current eco-
nomic climate was a key factor
in the decision to consolidate the
branches and offer their members
better services.
"Member organizations are
challenged now more than ever,"
he said.
In addition to promoting busi-
ness growth, a joint chamber of

commerce will also advocate for
social and economic policies that
are pertinent to both the Ann
Arbor and Ypsilanti communities,
according to the two chambers'
websites.
Accordingto Ouimet, the recent
merger gives the Ann Arbor and
Ypsilanti area "more clout" when
dealingwith the state government
and local universities.
Keller said that while the
merger is the right move, there
are logistical issues that the con-
solidation process might present.
The location of a headquarters is
still yet to be determined, as is
a unified set of bylaws, Keller
said.
Keller said cost was a fac-
tor in the consolidation of the
two chambers but added that

she doesn't anticipate losing any
chamber employees.
Some leaders of member orga-
nizations like the Michigan The-
ater are hopeful this union will
spark the local economy and help
local businesses.
Russ Collins, executive direc-
tor of the Michigan Theater, said
he thinks the merger is a logical
step.
'Ann-Arbor -and Ypsilanti
are the leading communities in
Washtenaw County and they
share a lot of similar dynamics,
and it makes a lot of sense to me,"
Collins said.
Collins said he thinks the newly
combined chambers will work to
bring fresh business opportuni-
ties to the area.
"I think one of the key things

that a chamber of commerce can
do is promote the business vital-
ity of a region and ... attract and
retain businesses to the area," he
said.
Because Ann Arbor and Ypsi-
lanti each have unique charac-
teristics, Collins said having
businesses in both areas work
together will benefit the collec-
tive communities. He added that
Ypsilanti is a "more up-and-com-
ing" city - much like the Ann
Arbor of the 1970s - and Ann
Arbor now has a "worldwide kind
of brand reputation," which will
allow the two cities to comple-
ment each other in terms of busi-
nesses.
"I just think that it's a really
good dynamic fusion of two really
interesting places," Collins said.

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

After a disappointing finish in '09,
Blue looks toward upcoming year

By CAITLIN SMITH
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan baseball team
spiced things up from the conven-
tional peanuts and Cracker Jacks,
kicking off its season with a "Meet
the Wolverines Night," yesterday.
The event consisted of a clown, free
food, decorative balloons and young
fans enthusiastically running from
player to player to receive auto-
graphs.
"The meet and greet is about pro-
moting and celebrating our great
tradition in baseball," Michigan
coach Rich Maloney said. "We have
a nice festive time in preparation for
the season and hopefully get people
excited to come out and watch the
boys play."
As the team's veterans, junior
Ryan LaMarre and senior co-cap-
tains Mike Dufek and Chris Berset
have experienced several meet and
greets over their years as Wolver-
ines.
"This event shows that the sea-
son is right around the corner,"
LaMarre said. "It gets the fans
ready to go, and it lets the young

guys who haven't done this before
get their feet wet and sign some
autographs."
The players may be enjoying
their stardom now, but they have
yet to swing a bat in competition.
Michigan's season opener is in just
over a week against Jacksonville
State in the Texas Tech Tourna-
ment. The Wolverines will then
continue their play on the road for
more than a month.
Michigan will face opponents
Louisville, St. Johns and South Flor-
ida at neutral venues, slightly easing
the challenge of playing away from
home. But a number of games will
be held at the opponents' stadiums,
toughening the competition. This
should be expected by players as
they represent Michigan - a state
known for snow-filled winters.
"It's hard to win on the road, first
of all," Maloney said. "Then you
factor in the statistic that the top 75
teams in the NCAA win 79 percent
of the time at their home venue. So
for our kids to travel, we're goingto
have to be road warriors."
Regardless of any on-the-road
apprehension along the way, Michi-

gan's ultimate goal is to make it to
Omaha and compete for a national
championship in June.
But the team must first redeem
itself after a disappointing finish
last year.
Michigan placed seventh in
the Big Ten at the end of the 2009
season. While this could hardly be
considered a disastrous finish, it
knocked the Wolverines off their
three-year pedestal as Big Ten
champions.
"We kind of got a little bit spoiled
there," Maloney said. "But we want
to get back, we want another taste
of it. We have a very, very difficult
schedule - the toughest by far in
the history of Michigan baseball.
But the good thing is, you learn
things together, you battle through
it together, and you grow as a team
together."
Pitching has been a key area of
concern for Michigan in the offsea-
son with the departure of ace Chris
Fetter, but the team has a solid com-
bination of speed and power.
"We need to be more consistent
all-around," LaMarre said. "Last
year we had our pitching show

up one night, our hitting show up
another, our defense another. So,
I think we are looking to put it all
together and really show up every
day."
Michigan also has several fresh-
men that will immediately enter
the starting lineup, including short-
stop Derek Dennis and outfielders
Patrick Biondi and Ben Ballantine.
Dennis was selected in the 10th
round of the 2009 MLB Draft by the
Tampa Bay Rays. He tuned down a
professional contract signing bonus
to be Michigan's shortstop this sea-
son.
"Dennis is a guy that was highly
acclaimed out.of high school," Malo-
ney said. "He is what football would
call a five-star player. He turned
down $700,000 to come to Michi-
gan. So he is out there, very on the
national scene. He is the guy every-
body else wished they would have."
Dennis could have been signing
autographs in Tampa as a profes-
sional athlete. Instead, he chose
to represent Michigan, bear the
inclement weather and sign team
posters at a Wolverine meet and
greet.

hink of your favorite song. It probably has a
chorus, a few verses, maybe a bridge, a melo-
dy and perhaps some harmony. But that's not
why you listen to it.
According to Dick Siegel, "A song has a very sim-
ple purpose. It's taking a feeling that you have - joy,
remorse, love, anger - and capturing it somehow
in this melody-rhythm-lyric tangle, and exposing
someone else to it."
The University graduate and Ann Arbor folk com-
munity mainstay has been refining the craft of song-
writing for more than 30 years. He's a member ofthe
Detroit Music Hall of Fame, a recipient of the Best
New Folk Artist award at the Kerrville Folk Festi-
val and, perhaps most notably, has a ham and turkey
sandwich named after him at Zingerman's Deli.
And now he has the title of University professor to
add to his resume.
Constructing a career
Considering Siegel's biography, college-aged stu-
dents are the perfect fit for the course he's teaching,
"Singing Out of Our Minds: A Songwriting Work-
shop." He started writing songs while attending the
University as an English major, with the aid of some
inspiration from Bob Dylan.
"At some point in college, I rediscovered Dylan,"
Siegel said. "When I first heard (him) when I was a
kid, I just couldn't stand (him). But when I started
listening to (him) in college, all of the sudden it was
like 'This music is just so visceral and so bare-bones
- with just a voice and a guitar.' And I played guitar
and I had a voice."
Soon Siegel was playing at a weekly open-mic
night called the Hootenanny at the Ark in its old Hill
Street location. He used this as a jumping-off point
to concentrate more time and energy on songwrit-
ing.
"One day I took a trip out to California after I

graduated in my VW mini-van, and on my way back
I thought of some experience I had with somebody
- some weird experience," he said. "And I started
making up this song ... and it was fun. (I thought)
'Wow, I just made this up,' and I liked it. It sort of
made sense of something that I was feeling, and
when I came back to Ann Arbor, I performed it at
the Ark.
"The reception was very good. It was probably
better than any other songI was singing."
This newfound love for songwriting snowballed,
and Siegel started to consider his music as the main
focus of his life. He was able to maintain this life-
style with a job in construction on the side.
"I struck some kind of a balance that worked for
me," he explained. "I was doing enough music, per-
forming enough, moving around enough, getting
music out to the world enough, and at the same time
I wasn't starving. And I was actually enjoying build-
ing things, building houses, being a carpenter."
Another key factor in the success of Siegel's music
career is the support of the Ann Arbor community
and its respect for the "endeavor of being creative."
This rich cultural atmosphere was especially notice-
able to Siegel, who grew up in New Jersey.
"Ann Arbor was one of these places that was very
friendly to a Bohemian existence, and so it was com-
fortable to stay here," he said. "And I've lived here
ever since."
"It's a community that, at least to a greater degree
than a lot of places, respects art and music," he
added.
Not only did this culture provide an enthusiastic
audience, it also produced a number of talented musi-
cians. Siegel recruited some jazz musicians to form a
band called Dick Siegel and the Ministers of Melody.
He recorded Snap!,'his debut and best-selling album
to date, in 1980 with the five-piece.
The album produced instant classics including
"When the Sumac Is On Fire," "What Would Brando
Do?" and "Angelo's" (an ode to Ann Arbor's favor-

ite little breakfast place), which can still be heard
every Saturday and Sunday morning on 94.7 WCSX,
Detroit's classic rock radio station. -
Since then, Siegel has recorded two more full
lengths and an EP varying in style and subject mat-
ter that showcase his versatility asa musician.
In honorable company
In his latest project, he now serves as this semes-
ter's Helen L. DeRoy Visiting Professor in the Hon-
ors Program, a position that has been held by some
impressive figures, including a Nobel laureate, a for-
mer Secretary of the Treasury and a former Prime
Minister of the United Kingdom.
So how did Siegel end up in the presence of such
formidable company?
Siegel's relationship with the Honors Program
started in November 2008, when he was a guest
speaker in the "Lunch with Honors" series.
This experience, along with an itch to teach song-
writing, led him to his current position.
"I've done some songwriting and I've been a part
of these songwriting retreats where you go and
people who are amateur songwriters come and they
spend a weekend and then I'd be hired as one of the
faculty songwriters and I'd teach them and perform
... and I enjoyed it," Siegel said.
Although the outlet for this teaching endeavor
wasn't initially evident, it became obvious after
some contemplation.
"I just began thinking about what that might
be like to actually teach songwriting here in Ann
Arbor," he said. "I went through a bunch of ideas,
and finally I thought, 'Of course, the University."'
But.does a songwriting class have any place in a
liberal arts college?
Timothy McKay, director of the Honors Program,
thinks so.

FOOD I° WARS

*I

BLIMPY BURGER
You might have to wait in a line out the
door or get yelled at by temperamental
employees. But all the hassle is worth it
for what's truly Ann Arbor's best slab of
meat. Other burger joints around town
have tried to emulate the formula of daily-
ground fresh beef and exotic extras like
salami or egg, but Blimpy is the original
king of greasy goodness.
SAVA'S
Maybe it was the low-lit, hip ambi-
ance, but I took my seat at the Sava's bar
expecting my burger to be pretty posh.
What I got instead was a sloppy, semi-
cooked slab, quickly prepared and care-
lessly assembled. Considering this wasn't
2 a.m. and I wasn'thammered - in which
case the burger wouldvebeen perfect - I
left feelinga little less than smitten.


CASEY'S TAVERN
With a rustic American tavern atmo-
sphere, Casey's is a great place to sit
down for a delicious burger. Offering you
a choice of three toppings among a very
long list, Casey's lets you perfect your
burger experience. But burgers are on the
slightly expensive side, and could stand to
be a bit juicier. Great burgers to be sure,
BURGERS but maybe not the best.
QUICKIE BURGER
It's quick, yes, and the proprietors are
always friendly and armed with a good-
natured quip or two. But how come I
always leave feeling abitunsatisfied with
a Major Burger? The bun's fine, the top-
pings are standard-issue and the meat is
... sufficiently meaty. There's just nothing
extraordinary here. Except for the Spe-
cial Sauce - that shit's delicious.

AND THE WINNER IS: BuMPY BURGER
CAMPUS CLASH
LAST WEEK'S RESULTS:
Phil Hanlon was just moving into his new provost office when he found it
had been infiltrated with the combatative Markley strippers. Hanlon swiftly
pulled out his accordian of death to try to cease the stripping. But the
strippers were used to the deafeningly loud music of Markley, and the
accordion had no effect. The strippers stripped on to victory.
WINNER: THE MARKLEY STRIPPERS

at high school jazz

of the soul. For Ticketsfrom $7
competitive
young musi-
cians, such subtleties amount to
the difference between wide-
spread renown and a long bus
ride home.
In his documentary "CHOPS,"
University alum and debut film
director Bruce Broder explores
the intricacies of jazz perfor-
mance with an intimate look into
three public schools in different
parts of the country. The film fol-
lows each school's jazz band as its

members rehearse a rigorous rep-
ertoire for a competition in New
York City.
One may be tempted to chuckle
at the thought of such an under-
taking - many college students
share embarrassing memories of
sub-par high school music depart-
ments, forever doomed to fumble
through their umpteenth rendi-
tion of the "Star Wars" theme song
as musicianship is continually
forgone in favor of sports fund-
ing. Fortunately, Broder's sub-
jects occupy a young elite who are
privileged enough to attend public
schools that place a disproportion-
ate emphasis on music over sports.
While watching the film, one
begins to see distinct similarities
between the camaraderie of these
musicians and the fraternity one
might observe on a competitive
sports team. Broder saw this simil-
itude, but-also saw that the media
has been spotlighting one group
vastly over the other and wanted
to shrink the gap.
"The primary draw of this con-
cept was the fact that very few
documentarians bother with the
subject of high school jazz bands,"

Broder said. "Sportsmen are fre-
quently the subjects of documen-
taries and mass media, so it was a
great opportunity to share these
kids' unsung musical passions
with the world."
Broder also wanted to show
off just how talented these young
musicians are. The technical skill
and affinity for perfectionism that
these tight-knit groups of teenage
jazz enthusiasts share rival the tal-
ent normally expected of veteran
musicians twice their age.
"What these kids have is a pure
love of music, a love of perfor-
mance," Broder said.
Pure doesn't even begin to
describe it. The documentary's
introduction clearly demonstrates
the hard work each student invests
in his or her craft. They're sur-
prisingly humble in spite of their.
abundant talent, and equally unre-
lenting in their endeavors to win
the competition.
"As a band parent myself, I fol-
lowed these kids from middle
school through high school, and

My Manic Pixie
Dream Girl

Jean Leverich is the director of the Living Arts Community, which will bring together creative students from different academic fields.

Uniting disciplines with
new Living Arts program

North Campus plays
home to an artistic
living-learning
community
By ANT MITCHELL
Daily Arts Writer
Creativity is not an academic
interest in and of itself, but an
attribute that can be applied to
disciplines ranging from music
and English to engineering and
math. Starting next year, there
1 will be a place on campus for
creative thinkers of all academic
interests to come together and
share their love of creativity and
the arts.
Next fall, North Campus is
introducing the Living Arts Com-
munity, a new housing opportu-
nity in Bursley Hall. Living Arts
will require participants to take
a one-credit class discussing cre-
ativity across the disciplines and
would encourage students to take
the creative process class, which
was the inspiration for the pro-
gram and is collectively taught by
the four North Campus schools,
if the students' schedules have
room.
Living Arts will also give stu-
dents the opportunity to work
together on largely student-cho-
sen projects. While the program
director and others may offer
suggestions - for instance, a cel-
ebration of the anniversary of the
University Symphony Band's trip
to Russia during the Cold War - it
will be largely up to the students
to decide what their involvement
will entail.
Jean Leverich, the director of
the Living Arts Community, has
the kind of enthusiasm for the
program that cannot be manufac-
tured.
"It's a dream job," Leverich
said of working with such a small
group of students so closely.
Though she explained her role
as simply "providing the sand-
box and some parameters for
play" along with a bit of friendly
nagging, her intense passion and
insistence on creating a program
developed mostly by students is
what gives the Living Arts Com-
munity steam.
"I really want to leave it to the
students," Leverich said.
In the fall, she will be ask-
ing the program's enrollees what
they envision or aspire to create,
allowing for, as she put it, "lots of
free-form jamming."
"How would it really be about
creative process if I was dictat-
ing, 'You will be creative in the
following ways?' " Leverich said,
explaining that this oversatura-
tion of structure is exactly what
the program is attempting to bat-
tle on North Campus.
Leverich explained that one of
the consequences of this overly
structured curriculum is that
students find themselves shuf-
fled away into studios due to the
focused nature of their programs
and are never given the opportu-
nity to work with students from
other fields.
Nathan Zukoff, a senior in
the interdisciplinary Engineer-
ing Program and head of the idea
organization, is familiar with such

a feeling. The idea organization is
a student-led, arts-inclined group
that arranges visits from notable
people and group projects facili-
tating and coordinating interdisci-
plinary efforts.
"I felt pigeonholed right away,"
Zukoff said. "Had I been a fresh-
man ... I would have signed up (for
the Living Arts Community), no
problem."
Leverich stressed "cross-field
fertilization and collaboration"
as a major goal of the Living Arts
Community. This allows for a
more open process that accepts
diverse methods for creative
problem solving.
Theresa Reid, executive direc-
tor of the Arts on Earth Program,
is entirely on board. Arts on Earth
is a larger-scale organization that
includes the Living Arts Commu-
nity and idea. It states its mission
as "integrating art-making and
the arts into the life of the Univer-
sity" so as to "educate, create and
collaborate." And although Liv-
ing Arts faced many difficulties
at first, whether monetary prob-
lems or just the lack of a certain
"spark," now things are finally
falling into place.
"I think that it's really in the
water in a way," Reid said. "The
deans just ... clicked, and this is
part of the fruit of that."
David Munson, the Robert
J. Vlasic Dean of Engineering,
described the collaborative effort
of the "merry band" of North
Campus deans as "trying to cre-
ate ... a special environment for
our students (through) legitimate
intersection between the disci-
plines."
At first, the emphasis of engi-
neering in the Living Arts Com-
munity may seem like an odd duck
when juxtaposed with things like
Art & Design and Architecture.
However, nothing could be fur-
ther from the truth, according to
Munson.
Munson described engineering
as the process of "creating new
things ... that didn't exist before."
He elaborated that engineering
wasn't about "just understand-
ing the world, but rather once you
understand the world, the physical
world, what can you do with that."
He added, "In (the College of)
Engineering, most of our students
actually are musicians. Funda-
mental math and science (are) not
sufficient to be an engineer."
Munson expressed a hope that
the Living Arts community will
serve to attract the kinds of stu-
dents who possess a variety of
interests with diverse ways of
thinking.
Jill Bender, an incoming fresh-
man interested in industrial
design, engineering, biology and
the arts, is just the sort of student
Munson speaks of.
Drawn almost immediately to
the program, Bender said she has
been talking about Living Arts
"non-stop since (she) found out
about it."
She described the community
as "somewhere where I know that
I'll fit."
But the Living Arts Community
is about more than sharing inter-
ests with your fellow students.
It's about finding the creative out-
lets on campus to explore those
interests and discover unfamiliar
methods of creativity.

S I've never stalked any-
one in my life before (not
even on Facebook; in fact,
I recently
disabled my
account, soI
am now 100
percent stalk-
free), butI
suppose at
some point in
a person's life,
she can make JENNIFER
an exception. XU
There's
this girl who
lives in my dorm - let's just call
her Zooey, after Zooey Descha-
nel - who has the best wardrobe
ever. She's just this everyday
girl: straight brown hair, straight
brown bangs, normal height, nor-
mal weight. But for some unfath-
omable reason, I adore her. I
don't know her, and she definitely
doesn't know me, but I cannot
describe the mixture ofjealousy
and admiration I feel whenever I
pass her on the street.
I'm not going to say this isn't
creepy, because it is. And I really
hope she doesn't read this.
Not that I follow her around or
anything like that. But I've kept
a running tally in my head of the
things she owns that I love. She
has these slouchy brown bots -
the kind so buttery and rich you
could spread them on toast - and
two coats, one fluttery red and
one forest green with toggles.
She wears gorgeous chiffon
dresses, colored tights and hair
bows atop her head. (I need to
stop before I get carried away)
If anyone else saw her walking
across the Diag, they'd just con-
sider hera pretty, well dressed
individual and move on. But to
me, she's that girl.
That girl, the kind of girl I
wish I could be, living the life I
wish I could live, dressing howI
wish I would dress. I know that's
such a MySpace thing to say,
but you know what I mean. The
kind who you watch from afar
and secretly admire. The kind
who wears the clothes you wish
you could wear, probably has the
conversations you wish you could
have. It's not even about who
she really is. I don't particularly
want to meet that girl. It's about
the way you see her through your
own distorted lens, the screwed-
up perceptions that you super-
impose upon her. This particular
girl might not be your that girl,
but you do have one, whether you
realize it or not.
When was the last time you
jealously listened in on a conver-
sation in the Union and wished
you were part of it? When was
the last time you passed someone
on the street dressed so amaz-
ingly well and wished not only
that you owned her skirt, but
her entire outfit and her entire
closet? All of these elements fac-
tor into your image of that girl,
the kind of person you dream to
be. That girl is not a celebrity,
but she's somehow tangible, even
though she's a complete stranger.
And the greatest thing is, it
doesn't matter what she's really
like. The thing she represents
- that's greater than the person
herself.
Contemporary cinema has
an explanation for this sort of
ridiculousness. It's called the

Manic Pixie Dream Girl, a term
coined by A.V. Club critic Nathan
Rabin as "that bubbly, shallow
cinematic creature that exists
solely in the fevered imaginations
of sensitive writer-directors to
teach broodingly soulful young
men to embrace life and its infi-
nite mysteries and adventures."
You know what kind I mean. She
has no dimensions save for being
extraordinarily cute, well dressed
and cultured. Natalie Portman in
"Garden State." Zooey Descha-
nel in "(500) Days of Summer."
Rachel Bilson in "The D.C.," pre-
environmentalist-Brown-student
craziness. Gorgeous wardrobe,
awesome taste in music, film,
whatever.
And if guys can dream about
getting the Manic Pixie Dream
Girl, girls can certainly dream
about being her, right?
But really, the concept of
the Manic Pixie Dream Girl is
bullshit. Do guys really think that
if they meet a girl who dresses
a certain way and has the same
taste in music as them that she
is automatically the one? Just
look at poor Tom in "(500) Days"
(despite my gripes about it, I
actually really like that movie).
Was that bitch Summer really,
truly the love of his life? Or was
I want to be
that girl.
she a chick that happened toube
cute and seemed to check all the
requisite "dream girl" boxes?
Conversely, doI automatically
think that if I looked like that
girl, I, too, would lead the perfect
life?
When it boils down to it, we
live in a culture that increasingly
values style over substance. We
want to make automatic snap
judgments about people because
it's easier, and it makes more
sense to like a person based on
the way he or she looks or the
stuff he or she does. If someone
likes the same movies and books
and music as you do, you feel
compelled to like the person.
Never mind if this person is real-
ly an asshole.
It's times like this that I want
to say "Stop. It's not about the
clothes. It's not about the stuff
you like. It's about the person and
the values that are inside." We're
just conditioned to think about
the superficial things that define
us and too lazy to make an effort
to really get to know a person. So
we make up this cheap substitute
to make us feel better. And con-
sequently, we resort to inventing
this ideal person who we want to
look, feel and act like. Frankly,
it's ridiculous.
Yet despite all my heavy hand-
ed moralizing, I can't change. I
refuse to change. Is itso wrong
that I have this vision of the kind
of person I've wanted to become
since I was a little girl? Thatgirl
is merely a fleshed-out version
of that image, and I just can't let
go of it.
I still want tobe that girl.

you were in the bathroom. To get it

Living Arts is still accepting students with an interest in joining.

Leverich stressed the impor-
tance of making "Living Arts a
place where students are really
plugged in to all the resources on
campus."
She described the multitude
of resources already on campus
as opportunities waiting to be
tapped into. In addition to pro-
moting attendance at the campus's
many arts events, the Living Arts
Community will give its residents
unique access to guest perform-
ers and visiting speakers from the
Penny Stamps lecture series, the
University Musical Society and
other programs.
Leverich sees herself as "some-
body who's able to help them
navigate those resources and take
advantage of them."
The Living Arts Community
offers many of the same advan-
tages of other living-learning
programs, like shrinking the
sometimes overly expansive
and impersonal University. One
might wonder, with all the avail-
able communities available here
at the University, why Living
Arts is significant. But in fact,
living-learning communities are
scarce on North Campus. This
does not mean, however, that
the program settled for a sub-
par location. The North Campus
location works as an attractive
feature in a number of ways.
"I've heard sometimes stu-
dents want to live in specific
learning communities because
they want to live ... in a specific
location," Leverich said.
These decisions based sole-
ly on location can often lead
to lackluster involvement in a
learning community's programs.
The North Campus location may
act as a filter for those students,
bringing together a group of
eager individuals who truly are
interested in the premise behind
the program.

And, as Leverich pointed out,
"the bus ride is really not that dra-
matic."
According to Reid, the loca-
tion choice was also dictated by
the fact that "this program was
designed and is co-sponsored by
the four North Campus deans,"
and that many of the classes
involved in the program meet on
North Campus.
Reid said the Bursley residence
hall will undergo renovations in
preparation for the new program.
She said the upgrade will create
additional practice rooms and stu-
dios, new performance and collab-
orative spaces and a gallery.
Although the deadline for
returning student housing has
passed, students still interested
are encouraged to contact the
directors if this sounds like a
program they would want to join.

thought it would he interesting to
examine what happens to that pas-

other interests."
Though the film's scope encom-

is the Douglas Anderson School of
the Arts in Jacksonville, Plo. These
pupils strive for a coveted spot in
the annual Essentially Ellington

ter in New York City.
The competition is named after
the great Duke Ellington, who is
widely considered to he the father
of modern jazz music. Only 15
hands make the cut for the competi-
tion each year, so there is very little
room for error. Perks of acceptance
include several formal dinners, a

ful force.
"It was particularly meaning-
ful in that it united them furs h rief
while," Broder said.
The students also come together
in spite of one of history's moat
common dividers: race. One third
of the students at the Douglas
Anderson School represent some
minority, hut the students see past
these exterior differences. They
are all handmates, and that's what
matters.
"One thing my good friendonoted
after watching the movie was that
there was very little of the animos-
ity one expects hetween students
of various ethnicities," Binder said.
"They are truly color-hllnd in their
conduct toward one another by
treating their peers as tantamount
to their own family."

the Ft. Lauderdale International

ing positive reviews from the Balti-
more Sun and CNN - rightly so. It
gives attention to an underexposed
group and highlights the camara-
derie and talent of a group of stu-
dents who have overcome harriers
that many adults still struggle to
see past.

A student performs his composition for Dick Siegel and the other members of his class

DICK SIEGEL
From Page lB
"Songs are a particularly won-
derful form of expression," McKay
said. "Almost everyone, in every
culture, listens to songs. Many
people sing them. But relatively
few have the chance to seriously
explore expressing themselves
through song."
Siegel also makes a convincing
argument to justify the class.
"(Poetry is) something that has

- .......... .

been taught at a university level,
where it's sort of the legitimate
form of self expression for many,
many years now," Siegel explained.
"Singer-songwriters (are) not
uncommon anymore. In fact, a
lot of people (are) using songs as a
form of self-expression.,
"And so a course in songwriting
made sense, even (if it's) not in the
music school, but in the liberal arts
school," he added.
Songwriting from scratch
With logistics and precedent
aside, a massive elephant in the
room remained. .-
Siegel had to confront the ques-
tions of "Can you teach somebody
how to write a song?" and "How
do you teach songwriting?"
He solved this puzzle by outlin-
ing three main components for the
The first is what Siegel calls the
"songwriting workshop," int which
people carry out the act of writing
and performing songs.
"Every two weeks they're com-
ing up with a new song," he said.
This part of the course forces
students out of their comfort zone
and jump-starts the creative pro-
It's not a free-for-all, however,
as Siegel seth up some guidelines.
For example, the first assignment
was centered around the theme of
"Sometimes limitations are
very good," Siegel explained.
"(They prevent) you from thinking
all things are possible. Maybe (if)
you just look at certain parameters
you can come up with something
and surprise yourself."
The method of constrainingcthe
students to one narrowly focused
ides has proven to be quite effec-
tive.
LSA sophomore Emily Byl,
a member of Siegel's class, said
"(Siegel) is very much a natural at
teaching. The first day we went in
he gotcus all really involved and we
wrote a song together right off the
bat."
In that first class, Siegel laid out
amelody and chorus, but no words
for the verses. The task was to
come up with some lyrics for the
holes in the song.
"Fifteen minutes later, every-
body had come up with something
to sing," Siegel said. "And this
is after the introductions when
everyone was saying how words
are hard to come by. And every-
body's words were so cool in all
different ways.
"It's just a trick of the mind,"
he added. "I sort of gave them a
different environment to be cre-
ative, without any of the usual of
'Oh, I can't do this' or 'What do I
feel today?' or any of that stuff. It
was just - boom - and they had
all these dense little images they
came up with, with meaning and
themes in four lines."
LSA sophomore and class mem-
ber Eimberly Grambo wrote in
an e-mail interview, "We have a
great mix of people with different
musical backgrounds, and I can
tell people are improving already.
Everyone has something awesome
and unique to bring to class every
week."
The second component in Sie-
gel's teaching process is a study of

the craft of songwriting, focusing
specifically on the creative aspect.
"There's a sense that I had that
people, by the time they're in col-

lege, have been listening to music
for2Oyears," hesaid. "Theyalready
have favorite songs, they've been
listening to songs. They love songs,
songs are meaningful. They carry
them around in their head, they
sing them. Intuitively, (rhey) have a
sense of what a good song is."
Questions like "What things are
happening while you write a song?"
and "What are the things you have
to attend to in order to do it well?"
come up frequently. Siegel is able to
provide constructive criticism to
students eagerly expressing them-
selves.
The final component in this
songwriting education is to become
familiar with American roots
"The songs that people hear
these days that are inspiring peo-
ple to write songs ... were inspired
by previous traditions. The more
you understand those traditions -
the basic, fundamental streams of
songwriting in the America n tradi-
tion -the more you can understanid
songwriting," Siegel explained.
Musicians like the "incred-
ible creative force" Willie Dixon
(known for his Chicago blues
arrangements sung by Muddy
Waters and Howlin' Wolf) and
the "watershed performer" Robert
Johnson (the most recognizable
face of Delta blues) are seen as the
forefathers of the American song-
writing tradition and are used to
illustrate the "basic form" of songs.
Grooving forward.
Even though he has quite a bit
of experience under his belt, Siegel
isn't done learning yet. He looks at
the songwriting course as a contin-
uation of his own education.
"Every week I have to come up
with something that's going to
move (the class) along and be inter-
esting to people (and also) interest-
ing to me," he explained. "(It has)
allowed me to explore all sorts
of things about my process, how
songs work, how creativity works
(and) about where American music
came from."
In fact, Siegel hopes to extend
the reciprocal effect of the class by
searching for other teaching out-
lets in the future, citing the Resi-
dential College as something he
will look into.
And students would certainly
benefit from having the chance to
learn under such a passionate art-
ist.
"He has a lot of energy, and be
is very passionate about what he
does," Byl said. "He really knows
how to get us energized about sing-
ing and songwriting."
And Siegel is just as energized as
his students.
"I'mihavingsavery positive expe-
rience," he said. "It's fascinating
to me. I really enjoy working with
the people I'm working with. I'm
learning so much, and it seems like
a valuable thing to do. And it's real-
ly a pleasure to be teaching at the
University."
The intensely personal and
exceedingly subjective process of
writing a song will never be broken
down into an exact science. But by
emphasizing the value of routinely
writingoand performing, the impor-
tance of squeezing a single emotion
into a set of words and the signifi-
cance of studying the greats, Dick
Siegel, armed with the many years
he has spent perfecting his craft,

is making the complex art of song-
writing a little more digestible.
