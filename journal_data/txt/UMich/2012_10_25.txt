STUDENT RECORDS
Accidental
grade leak
a breach of
federal law

Engineering sophomore David Fontenot explains the premise behind the MHackers organization to meeting attendees Wednesday evening.
CSG commission hopes to
unite campus entreprenuers,

GSI mistakenly
sends student
information to
435-person class
By TUI RADEMAKER
Daily StaffReporter
With midterms in full swing,
many students are constantly
refreshing CTools pages for
any sign of posted exam results.
For those enrolled in Cultural
Anthropology 101 with Prof.
Andrew Shryock however, they
got more than just their own
results this week.
An excel spreadsheet con-
taining the results of all the stu-
dents's grades - including their
names, uniganses, UM-ID
numbers, course sections, exam
percentages and the key used to
grade each individual's exam -
was accidentally made public
when attached to an e-mail sent
to them noting that their grades
were posted.
Under the Family Educa-
tional Rights and Privacy Act,
releasing students's academic

records is a violation of federal
law. There are some exceptions
such as in the case of a student
transferring to another institu-
tion or in the case of financial
aid applications that such infor-
mation can be released.
University Spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald wrote in an e-mail
that while the publication of
midterm results is in violation
of FERPA, he believes that the
inadvertent nature of it will
allow the University to sim-
ply file a report with the U.S.
Department of Education with
the appropriate documentation
and an explanation that will
mitigate any potential FERPA
violations.
Chris Berk, the head gradu-
ate student instructor for the
course, said in an interview that
the release was a clerical error
and when he sent the spread-
sheet to the students he thought
that the identifying unignames
and names of the 435 students
had been taken out of the docu-
ment.
"It was an error," Berk
said. "I spent hours with the
spreadsheets and I thought I

Leaders from 15
organizations unite
to brainstorm
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
Manish Parikh, the Central
Student Government president,

introduced the first step in
making good on his campaign
promise to bring more entre-
preneurship opportunities to
students on Wednesday.
Leaders of 15 student orga-
nizations convened in the CSG
chambers for the inaugural
Entrepreneurship Commission
meeting. While several partici-
pating organizations, such as

MPowered and M-Entrepre-
neurship, are deeply rooted in
entrepreneurial pursuits, less
business-focused organiza-
tions such as MHackers and
TEDxUofM were also in atten-
dance.
More than an hour of the
90-minute meeting was spent
on introductions alone. Parikh,
a Business senior, in

his presentation of CSG to the
commission, said he wants the
promotion of entrepreneurship
to be the cornerstone of his
year in CSG.
In particular, he listed Air-
bus, Fall Break and UPetition
as major successes of former
student government adminis-
trations. Parikh said he wanted

POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS
College GOP
looks to Dems
to better image

Republicans hope
to improve campus
presence
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
The campaign ads on tele-
vision aren't the only political
messages on campus this fall
competing for student attention.
As the maize and blue donkey
logo of the University's chapter
of College Democrats is seen on
fliers across campus, the Univer-
sity's chapter of College Republi-
cans also hopes to create a name
and brand for itself.
At the behest of LSA senior
Rachel Jankowski, the chair of
the College Republicans, the
group is seeking to revamp its
image on campus with the Col-
lege Democrats' strategy in
mind. The aim, Jankowski said,
is to make the College Republi-
cans more visible on campus, in.
part by building a brand name
and logo.
"A lot of students don't know
that the College Republicans
exist (on campus), and that's

really terrible," Jankowski said.
"We're trying to really build a
presence on campus, and build
a solid look about us so that you
know, when you see an advertise-
ment, that's the College Republi-
cans and not a different club."
The task of reshaping the
group's image belongs mostly to
its marketing committee, which
Jankowski said has attracted
nearly 30 to 40 members this
semester, an unprecedented
number.
Jankowski said the committee
has been attempting to establish
a brand by creating a "unified
look" on the group's T-shirts, fli-
ers, banners and other parapher-
nalia - much like the College
Democrats.
"I want the College Repub-
licans to have a brand name,"
Jankowski added. "Any good
company has one, and the College
Democrats have a great brand
name. When you see their stuff,
you know it's the College Demo-
crats. That is what the College
Republicans have been focusing
on, and it's what we're pushing."
The College Democrats ini-
tially had the same concern

The University Department of
Public Safety held its first public
crime meeting of the semester
Monday to educate the Univer-
sity community about crime and
other safety issues.
Joe Piersante, the interim
executive director for the new
Division of Public Safety and
Security, began by discussing the
reorganization of security orga-
nizations, that was authorized by
the University's Board of Regents
at their meeting on Friday.
The Division of Public Safety

Former UMHS
resident appears in
court
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
Though he allegedly broke
his court-appointed curfew six
times over the past six months,
former University of Michi-

gan Health System resident
Stephen Jenson will no longer
be held to a curfew or several
other court-ordered restric-
tions.
Earlier this month, Jenson,
who faces charges of posses-
sion of child pornography with-
in the University Hospital, was
accused of repeatedly violating
his curfew and using a comput-
er not monitored by the court.
After repeated violations,

Jenson's nightly curfew was
curtailed from an 8 p.m. start
time to a 5 p.m. start time, but
he still violated the curfew. In a
court hearing Wednesday, the
terms of his release were once
again adjusted.
Many of the prior conditions
of Jenson's release - including
avoiding contact with minors

Kennedy cousin denied
parole in 1975 Conn. slaying parle0

Pleaded innocent at
appeal hearing on
golf club attack
SUFFIELD, Conn. (AP) -
Imprisoned Kennedy cousin
Michael Skakel lost a bid for free-
dom on Wednesday, turned down
at his first parole hearing since
he was convicted a decade ago
of beating his teenage neighbor
to death with a golf club and told
he would not be eligible again to
be considered for release for five
DO ,

years.
Skakel, who proclaimed his
innocence at the hearing, nod-
ded, grimaced and patted his
attorney on the back as he was
led away after the three-person
state parole board announced the
unanimous decision.
Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Ken-
nedy, the widow of Robert F. Ken-
nedy, was convicted in 2002 of
fatally beating Martha Moxley
in Greenwich in 1975, when they
were 15. He is serving 20 years to
life in prison.
The decision was the latest

HSUlD0K',,

setback for Skakel, who has lost
appeals challenging his convic-
tion. Skakel, whose case has long
drawn national attention, has
another appeal challenging the
work and competency of his trial
attorney coming up for trial in
the spring. Skakel claims the trial
attorney had financial problems
and didn't devote enough money
to prepare the case, but the attor-
ney insists he did everything he
could to keep Skakel from being
convicted.
The denial of parole came after
Skakel's supporters, including
his cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,
sent letters to the parole board
describinghim as a model inmate
who has touched many lives in a
positive way with his artwork and
by helping recovering alcoholics
and teaching English as a second
language to prisoners. The sup-
purters also say hers been devuted
tu his sun despite being in prisun.
At the hearing at McDougall-
Walker Correctional Institution
in Suffield, Skakel spoke slowly
and softly, saying: "I did not com-
mit this crime."
In attendance was the victim's
mother, Dorthy Moxley, who said
losing a child is the worst thing in
the world and Skakel should serve
at least 20 years.
"Martha, my baby, will never
have a life," she said, her voice
breaking.
Skakel told the parole board
he prays every day that whoever
committed the crime is brought
to justice but he is the wrong man.
He said his best chance to win
parole was to admit guilt.
"If I could ease Mrs. Moxley's
pain in any way, manner, shape or
form I would take responsibility
all daylongforthis crime,"Skakel
said.
But, he added, "I cannot bear
false witness against myself."
The 52-year-old Skakel, with
gray, thinning hair, wore a tan
prison jumpsuit to the hearing. To
support his claims of innocence,
he told ofhowhe became sober.
"I pose to you: How can a guilty
man stay sober for 30 years with
that kind of guilton his mind?" he
said.

NYT defends incoming
chief amid sexual assault

,96

Former CEO under
suspicion of having
prior knowledge of
employee's abuses
LONDON (AP) - The New
York Times stood by its incom-
ing chief Wednesday, even as
questions about a BBC child
sex abuse scandal followed
him from one of Britain's most
respected news organizations
to one of America's..
But as new CEO Mark
Thompson was getting support
from his new bosses, the Times
ombudsman questioned his fit-
ness for the job.
And in Britain, a lawmaker
said he had more questions for
Thompson.
As Thompson prepares to
take over as president of The
New York Times next month,
he has been put on the defensive
about his final days as head of
the BBC and the broadcaster's
decision to kill what would have
been a bombshell investigative
story alleging the late Jimmy
Savile, one of its biggest stars,

had sexually abused up to 200
children.
In a letter to a lawmaker and
an interview with the Times,
Thompson said he never knew
of the Savile story before it was
spiked and had never met the
network's popular star.
New York Times Co. spokes-
man Bob Christie said Wednes-
day that the BBC scandal had
"obviously been a topic that
we've discussed" internally, but
the Times was satisfied with
Thompson's answers.
"Mark has done an excellent
job of explaining the matter,"
Christie said. Thompson said
he played no role in spiking the
BBC investigation and "we're
satisfied with that."
Thompson will start as the
organization's CEO on Nov. 12,
Christie said.
The BBC scandal has hor-
rified Britain with revelations
that Savile, a popular children's
television presenter, cajoled and
coerced vulnerable teens into
having sex with him in his car,
in his camper van, and even in
dingy dressing rooms on BBC
premises. He is also accused
of sexually assaulting disabled

children at hospitals that he
helped by raising charity funds.
Police say there couldbe more
than 200 victims, leading one
child protection charity to say
that Savile could rank among
Britain's most prolific child sex
predators.
The BBC said Tuesday it was
looking into claims of sexual
abuse and harassment against
nine other current and former
employees and contributors.
As increasing numbers of
BBC executives come under
the microscope over what they
knew about Savile - and why
the posthuious expose about
his sexual crimes was shelved
- Thompson, 55, the BBC direc-
tor-general from 2004 until last
month, is being quizzed about
his role as well.
In a letter to Conservative
lawmaker Rob Wilson, Thomp-
son said he never met Savile or
worked on any of the entertain-
er's programs, and had never
heard any rumored stories
about Savile's interest in young 4
girls.
"If I had, I would have raised
them with senior colleagues and
contacted the police," he said.

Former premier

Former Italian Premier Silvio
Berlusconi announced Wednes-
day that he won't run for a fourth
term in spring elections and said
his center-right movement should

didate.
"I won't run for premier," Ber-
lusconi said in a statement posted
on his movement's website, "but I
will remain next to younger play-
ers who need to play and score
goals."
Berlusconi, who stepped down
in November after failing to
come up with effective economic
Sreforms to shield Italy from the
debt crisis, has until now been
coy about his intentions. But the

that the 76-year-old media mogul,

Security Council
unanimously OKs
Syrian ceasefire

In this June 10, 2005 file photo, workers walk past a part of Qinshan No. 2 Nuclear Power Plant, China's first self-designed and self-built national
commercial nuclear power plant. China is ready to approve new nuclear power plants as part of ambitious plans to reduce reliance on oil and coal.

Four-day truce
planned for Muslim
holiday
BEIRUT (AP) - The U.N.
Security Council gave unani-
mous backing Wednesday to a
four-day truce proposed by the
international mediator for Syria
to mark a major Muslim holiday
after he warned that the failure
of yet another cease-fire plan
would only worsenthe fighting.
Yet even this modest effort -
the international community's
only plan for scaling back the
violence - appears doomed.
Previous cease-fire missions
have failed, in part because nei-
ther Syrian President Bashar
Assad nor rebels trying to top-
ple him had an incentive to end
their bloody war of attrition.
Both sides believe they can still
make gains on the battlefield
even as they are locked in a
stalemate, and neither has faith
in negotiations on a political
transition.
Lakhdar Brahimi, the U.N.-
Arab League envoy to Syria,
has proposed that both sides
lay down their arms during the
Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha,
which begins Friday.
The Security Council is nor-
mally divided on Syria, but

Assad allies Russia and China
joined other council members
in endorsing the idea of a tempo-
rary truce that is meant to pave
the way for talks on ending Syr-
ia's 19-month-old conflict.
The response on the ground
ranged from lukewarm to down-
right rejection. Syrian govern-
ment officials said they were still
studying the idea, while Syria's
political opposition said it was
skeptical of the regime's prom-
ises. A rebel commander dis-
missed the plan as irrelevant and
a radical Islamist group fighting
alongside the rebels said it won't
comply with any truce.
As Brahimi briefed the Secu-
rity Council, the death toll since
the start of the conflict in March
2011 crossed the threshold of
35,000, activists said, and more
violence was reported across the
country.
Two car bombs killed at least
eight bus passengers in the cap-
ital Damascus and 12 regime
soldiers near a military check-
point in the north, while regime
airstrikes on villages near a
besieged army base killed 12
civilians, activists said. They
also posted a video showing at
least 13 bodies laid out Wednes-
day in a room in a Damascus
suburb, some of them women
and children. Each side blamed
the other for the deaths.

Decision aimed to
decrease reliance on
fossil fuels despite
nuclear dangers
BEIJING (AP) - China has
decided to approve new nuclear
power plants as part of plans
to reduce reliance on oil and
coal, ending the moratorium
it imposed to review safety in
the wake of Japan's Fukushima
disaster last year.
The government's decision
Wednesday that nuclear power
is safe for China takes the coun-
try in the opposite direction
from some developed nations
such as Germany, which decid-
ed in the wake of the Fuku-
shima disaster to speed its
complete phase-out of nuclear
power. Japan is planning to
phase it out by 2040.
China is the world's biggest
energy consumer, and build-
ing new reactors is a key part of
Beijing's plans to curb demand
for fossil fuels.
The communist govern-
ment is aggressively promoting
alternatives to coal and oil in
order to reduce pollution and
curb its reliance on imported
petroleum, which it sees as a
national security risk. Still,
coal is forecast to remain the
country's main energy source
for decades.
The government said
Wednesday it hopes to gener-

ate 30 percent of China's power
from solar, wind and other
renewable sources, as well as
from nuclear energy, by the end
of 2015. That's up from an ear-
lier target of 15 percent from
renewables plus 5 percent from
nuclear by 2020.
The Cabinet on Wednesday
passed plans on nuclear power
safety and development that
said construction of nuclear
power plants would resume
"steadily."
Only a small number of
plants will be built, and only
in coastal areas, according to
a Cabinet announcement. The
plants will meet the most strin-
gent safety standards, it said.
No date was given for resum-
ing construction of nuclear
plants. Despitewidespreadpub-
lic concern over possible radia-
tion contamination from the
Fukushima disaster and calls
for improved safety precau-
tions and emergency prepared-
ness, China remains committed
to building up nuclear power
to help reduce emissions from
coal-fired plants and curb its
reliance on costly oil imports.
China suspended approvals
of new nuclear plants after a
tsunami triggered by the mas-
sive March 11, 2011, earthquake
crippled the Fukushima plant's
cooling and backup power
systems, causing partial melt-
downs in the worst nuclear
disaster since the 1986 Cher-
nobyl catastrophe.
China's leaders ordered

safety checks for existing
nuclear facilities, a review of
projects under construction
and improved safety stan-
dards.
"The inspection results show
that nuclear security is guaran-
teed in China," according to a
government report on its ener-
gy policy also released Wednes-
day. "China implements the
principle of 'safety first' in the
whole process of nuclear power
station planning."
China currently has 15 nucle-
ar reactors that provide about
12.5 gigawatts of generating
capacity, and another 26 reac-
tors are under construction
that will add 30 gigawatts, the
report said.
Nuclear power accounts for
only 1.8 percent of power in
China, it said.
The government report also
said that China is now 90 per-
cent energy self-sufficient, but
acknowledged high demand
will continue to put a strain on
resources.
It also warned of"grave chal-
lenges" to its energy security
in its growing dependence on
imported petroleum. Imports
accounted for a third of total
petroleum consumption in the
early 2000s and have jumped
to nearly 60 percent now, the
report said.
China will also encourage
private companies to partici-
pate in exploration and devel-
opment of energy resources, it
said.

Auto bailout key for
Obama's pull in Ohio

More than 850,000
Ohio jobs are tied to
the car industry
LORDSTOWN, Ohio (AP)
- President Barack Obama's
decision to help America's
automakers could end up being
what helps drive him back into
the White House.
Some 850,000 jobs in this
critical battleground state are
tied to autos and Obama's cam-
paign constantly reminds vot-
ers they'd be jobless if not for
the decision to inject taxpayer
dollars into General Motors
and Chrysler. However, the
move has not translated into
automatic support for the presi-
dent, even in areas that depend
on the industry. Republican
Mitt Romney also is pitching
these voters hard with his mes-
sage that Obama hasn't bal-
anced Washington's checkbook
the same way voters must.
One in eight jobs in Ohio can
be linked to the auto industry -
whether it's working on a fac-
tory floor or selling groceries
to plant workers. The presiden-
tial race's outcome could boil
down to whether voters inter-
pret Obama's move as saving
Detroit or bailing it out. But like
other flashpoints in this rough
campaign, there is little middle

ground between the versions
of events and what it means for
voters' neighbors.
"I couldn't imagine what
Lordstown would be," said
Brian Axiotis, a 37-year-old
Obama supporter who works
in information technology and
lives in nearby Newton Falls.
"A lot of folks would lose their
houses. Consider the mess
that would have resulted. It'd
be a ghost town all over the
area."
Since its restructuring, the
General Motors plant in this
town of 4,000 people southeast
of Cleveland has added a third
shift - and 1,200 new workers
with it - to produce the popu-
lar compact Chevy Cruze. GM
has pledged $220 million in
updates to the factory and to
keep the 4,500 workers, sug-
gesting this town in the former
steel-heavy Mahoning Valley
has some stability ahead.
Romney volunteer Frank
Perrotta still finds Obama's
decision to loan automakers
billions a misuse of public dol-
lars. Between calls to voters
at Romney's office in Stow, he
shakes his head when talk-
ing about the government's
move to prevent the collapse of
GM and Chrysler. The bailout
began in 2008 under Repub-
lican George W. Bush and
Obama extended it.

Many GOP candidates rebuke
controversial rape comments

Mourdock says
'God intended'
pregnancies that
result from rape
WASHINGTON (AP) - Just
as Mitt Romney and other
Republicans had cut into the
Democrats' advantage with
female voters, a tea party-
backed Senate candidate's
awkward remark - that if rape
leads to pregnancy it's "some-
thing God intended" - has
propelled the emotional issue
of abortion back to the politi-
cal forefront. It's put GOP can-
didates in tight races, from
the presidential candidate on
down, on the defensive.
Divisive social issues are
hardly what most GOP candi-
dates want to be discussing in
the few days remaining until
elections largely hinging on
jobs and the economy. Almost
immediately after Richard
Mourdock's comment, Republi-
can candidates distanced them-
selves from the Indiana state
treasurer - though by varying
degrees.
The Romney campaign said
Wednesday that the presiden-
tial nominee disagreed with
Mourdock but stood by his
endorsement of the Senate can-
didate. There were no plans to
drop a Romney testimonial ad
for Mourdock that began airing
in Indiana on Monday.

Mourdock's comment in a
Tuesday night debate came in
answer to a question on when
abortion should or should not be
allowed. Said Romney spokes-
woman Andrea Saul: "We dis-
agree on the policy regarding
exceptions for rape and incest
but still support him."
Reaction was quick, from
Republican senators and can-
didates rejecting Mourdock's
statement.
Massachusetts Sen. Scott
Brown, struggling to hold onto
his seat against a challenge
from Democrat Elizabeth War-
ren, said he was "a pro-choice
Republican and that's not what
I believe and I disagree with
what he said." Pressed on his
support for Mourdock's candi-
dacy, Brown said that was up to
Indiana voters.
Connecticut Republican
Linda McMahon, bidding for
the Senate seat there, called
Mourdock's remarks "highly
inappropriate and offensive.
They do not reflect my beliefs as
a woman or a pro-choice candi-
date."
New Hampshire Repub-
lican Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who
had planned to campaign with
Mourdock in Indiana, canceled
her appearance.
In Wisconsin, former Repub-
lican Gov. Tommy Thompson,
who faces Democratic Rep..
Tammy Baldwin, called Mour-
dock's comments "really sad."
"I've got a wife and two
daughters and six granddaugh-

ters," he said in an interview.
"Anything dealing with rape
against women is uncalled for.
Period. No tolerance whatso-
ever."
Sen. John McCain, the 2008
GOP presidential nominee, told
CNN that his continued support
of Mourdock "depends on what
he does." The Arizona law-
maker who was the GOP's 2008
presidential nominee, said he
wants to see "if he apologizes
and says he misspoke and he
was wrong and asks people to
forgive him. It's when you don't
own up to it that people will not
believe in you."
Mourdock's debate comment
recalled GOP Senate candidate
Todd Akin's remark in August
about rape and pregnancy. The
Missouri congressman said
women's bodies have ways of
preventing pregnancy in cases
of "legitimate rape." Repub-
licans, led by Romney, called
for Akin to abandon the race,
but he refused and is pressing
ahead against Democratic Sen.
Claire McCaskill.
Romney and several Repub-
licans have been moderat- -
ing their positions in the
campaign's closing days, mak-
ing their final pitch to the
independents, undecideds and
female voters whose votes
could tip both the presidential
election and majority control
of the Senate. Recent national
polls have shown Obama's edge
with female voters shrinking to
single digits.

Drowned in debt
Government should extend college loan payback periods
As college costs continue to increase - by 2.8 percent for in-state
students and 3.5 percent for out-of-state students for the 2012-
2013 academic year at Michigan - and post-grad job prospects
worsen, more college graduates are defaulting on their student loans.
Facing an uncompromising job market, fewer college graduates are able
to pay their loans back on time and are facing serious legal repercus-
sions. In 2011, the default rate for the first three years after graduation
was 13.4 percent - an alarming 14-year high. All levels of government
should explore policy to extend the deadline for student loan payments so
graduates have time to secure a job before being hit with their tuition bill.

Fuck the non-voter?

n 2008, P. Diddy gave the
American people two choices:
You can either vote in the presi-
dential election,
or, to quote the
Geto Boys, you
can "die, mother-
fucker, die."
In all fairness,
these options did
stand the test of
time. Fast for-
ward four years. MELANIE
On Nov. 6, you KRUVELIS
may choose to
vote. You may
also choose to die. But the list doesn't
have to end there. You could vote or
go to the grocery store.,Vote or watch
"Full House" reruns.
And here's an overlooked option:
you could vote, or you could not vote
at all.
Now, be careful with the last
option. Side effects of not vot-
ing include a loss of respect from
friends and family, exclusion from
the right to political opinions and
being pelted with vegetables each
time you leave your house. All con-
ventional wisdom holds that non-
voters are the political stoners.
They sit around, smoke drugs, plot
the destruction of America through
electoral non-participation and roll
up another traitor doobie. Or at the
very least, they're too damn lazy to
care.
But does that fairly summarize
the non-voter? That the only thing
stopping their ballot is the lure of a
loveseat?
While it's certainly true that some
non-voters don't care, writing off all
non-participants as being so Cheech
and wrong misses the point. Our
masturbatory attitude to the voting
process and absolute disgust with
those who don't show up on Election
Day, masks flaws in a nonsensical
electoral system.
For every death threat handed out
to the non-voters there's a high five
for the guy who threw his ballot in

the box. At the root of this is an ele-
mentary understanding of elections:
voting good, not voting bad. And at
the root is a serious misunderstand-
ing of reality. Going to the polls can
be good, but it doesn't have to be.
Elections are a fair-weather field day.
Think of it this way: you go to the
polls, fill in a bubble for president and
then you get a sticker that tells the
world - look, I did it! I voted! Then
you go about your way.
But, wait. Does non-participation
in and ignorance toward sections of
the ballot - school board elections
or county sheriff - make you a less-
valid voter? Popular opinion doesn't
seem to think so. When you avoid
the court of appeals candidates on
the ballot because "they don't affect
you" or you don't know enough to
make an informed decision, no one
accuses you of being a bad voter or
a bad American. So why do we draw
the same conclusions for the presi-
dential vote?
Pro-votingvoters willtellyou the
distinction comes from the interna-
tional implications of the presiden-
cy. It's a globalized globe out there,
or something. And foreign percep-
tion of the United States won't come
from whatever your district judge
is doing. No, it comes from the face
that we sell to the world - iPods. I
mean iPresidents.
Dammit, I mean presidents.
Look, the president is the star of the
show. So suck up your hemp seed
and Chomsky smoothies, you radi-
cal, and just go vote already.
Okay, fine. Let's look at the can-
didates then. We've got Republican
presidential nominee Mitt Romney,
who wouldn't know a uterus from
a kumquat, so that's no good. And
then there's the Obama administra-
tion, whose off-the-record drone
attacks in Pakistan have not only
killed civilians, but also further
fostered anti-American sentiments
worldwide.
Then there are the third-party
candidates - no wait, it's a trap!

Because in a post-2000 election
world, a vote for a third-party can-
didate is written off as a "wasted"
vote, the good-for-nothing, teenage
angst vote. Never mind that you're
just picking the candidate that you
think best represents your vision for
the country. This is an election, for
Christ's sake, you two-party pooper.
Quit trying to Nader the election.
So what do we have left? An illu-
sion of choice. We're told we have
to vote. We're given a list of candi-
dates. Now take off more than half
of them, because they don't count.
And circle your favorite out of the
two left. See? Don't you feel like a
good citizen now?
'Quit trying
to Nader the
election.'
I don't mean to bastardize all
voters. If you follow policy and
think you know your candidate,
then by all means, vote away. But
this "fuck the non-voter" rhetoric
works under the assumption that
voting is the perfect form of politi-
cal participation. And it's not.
Hell, it's not even the most
effective. The success of the civil
rights movement is rarely attrib-
uted to Malcolm X's vote for JFK.
It worked because the leaders got
creative with their politics.. There
wasn't a reliance on the least-war-
mongering, least-corrupt, least-
shitty leader to get the work done.
This D.I.Y. understanding of poli-
tics illustrates an important point:
Participation isn't only valid within
the franchise.
If only someone put that on a
sticker.

Accordingto a Bloombergnews article, more
than 10 percent of .federal student loan bor-
rowers default on loan payments that amount
to $1trillion nationwide. Meanwhile, graduate
student unemployment has reached a record
high, with an 8.8 percent unemployment rate
in 2011 with a successful job search timeframe
of about six months. And student debt con-
tinues to increase with the average hovering
around $27,000. This means that only one year
after graduation, the interest accrued is almost
$2,000.
With these obstacles, many students have
had no choice but to default on their loans, as
they simply do not have the money to settle
debts so soon after graduation. Luckily, the
2012-2013 academic year student loans has
seen leveled interest rates at 3.4 percent for
subsidized and 6.8 percent for unsubsidized
and graduate loans.
Still, studies have shown the seriousness of
graduate student unemployment and its effect
on loan defaults. In a 2011 college graduate
survey, only 287 of 503 college graduates sur-
veyed reported full-time employment imme-
diately after graduation. One-third of students
moved back home with their parents and
approximately one-fifth of these graduates are
now financially dependent on their parents.
The combination of a poor job market and high

student loan costs make it increasingly diffi-
cult for graduates to live on their own. Many
are drowned in debt before they can even earn
their first post-grad paycheck.
Diversity of college majors is also shrink-
ing as a result of the struggling job market.
The same study showed that nearly one-half
of employed graduates work at jobs that do not
require a four-year college degree. A college
education should have more leverage in the job
market, but at the same time should be flexible
enough to allow students to pursue their inter-
ests. With the threat of student debt looming
overhead, many students are pressured into
majors that traditionally garner high paying
jobs. Without a five or six-figure debt looming
after graduation, we wouldn't want to lose less
profitable but nonetheless important concen-
trations.
Government needs to extend the student
loan payback timeframe. A longer student
loan grace period will give graduates more
time to organize their finances and maintain
their credit scores. This will decrease default
rates and create more stability for graduates
and lenders alike. In today's floundering econ-a
omy, finding a job is a time consuming rar-
ity. Extending student loan deadlines allows
graduates to look forward to their careers, not
backward in regret at their student debt.

LETTER T THE EDITOR SEND LETTERS TO: TOTHEDAILY@MICHIGANDAILY.COM

Proposal 6 gives the people
the power to decide
TO THE DAILY:
Katie Burke's article on Proposal 6 and the
New International Trade Crossings (NITC)
("Backed by a billionaire, Proposal 6 fights
second bridge to Windsor," 10/23/12), contains
several misleading assertions.
In the article, Ms. Burke says, "The measure
[Proposal 6] is aimed at stopping a proposed
second bridge that will be entirely financed by
the Canadian government." Neither of these
claims is correct.
Proposal 6 is not designed to stop the NITC,
but rather, to offer citizens a say before their
governor entangles them in a shaky financing
scheme with a foreign power without legisla-
tive approval. Were the proposal to pass, and
were Michigan taxpayers to then deem the
NITC a worthy use of state resources, the proj-
ect would proceed.
Second, Michigan taxpayers will pay, and
have already paid, for the project. To date,
the state has spent $41 million studying the
NITC, a new customs plaza will cost U.S.
taxpayers (including Michiganders) $263

million, and the state will lose millions in
lost tax and toll revenue at existing crossings
from which the NITC will cannibalize traf-
fic. In addition, there's nothing in the Cross-
ing Agreement that specifies Canada will
cover any cost overruns, which average 61
percent for this type of project, according to
the U.S. Department of Transportation.
The article also quotes Prof. Thomas Lyon,
who asserts the project would bring Michi-
gan an additional $2.2 billion in federal high-
way matching funds. However, such funds
are subject to a state-by-state cap. Michi-
gan has never failed to maximize its state
contribution to receive the highest possible
amount, so the $2.2 billion doesn't represent
any "new" money the state wouldn't oth-
erwise receive from the Federal Highway
Administration.
Proposal 6 is an opportunity for Michigan
taxpayers to assert fiscal self-determination
that thus far, the governor has been working
to deny.

There was a time when our
institutions- of higher edu-
cation were founded on a
religious basis
- both Harvard
University and
Yale University
began as Protes-
tant seminaries.
A century and
a half later, the
religious land- SARAH
scapes of such ROHAN
schools have
disappeared.
In adopting a progressive
approach to education, most promi-
nent universities abandoned their
prescribed religious view in favor of
a liberal acceptance of all faiths. And
with the years of religious quotas
in college admissions behind us, it
seems we now live in an era of gen-
eral religious tolerance within the
world of higher education.
To date, the University has 24
recognized religious student clubs
ranging from the Muslim Students'
Association to the Hindu Students
Council to Hillel. The University cer-
tainly provides a space for religious
growth and identity and a vast array
of courses on religious studies.
And yet, it seems that the privi-
lege of religious respect on this
campus and in many other liberal
universities is afforded to a very
narrow category of religious per-
sons. It's specifically reserved for
the practitioner of secular obser-
vance; the."religiously liberal."
By "religiously liberal," I don't
mean to describe someone who iden-
tifies with a religious culture - be it
Christianity, Hinduism or other -
but rather someone whose religious
adherence to the rules of his or her
religion is, well, liberal. Progressive,
reformed, modern or however one
sees it, a "religiously liberal" observ-
er often values historical identity and
tradition over strict compliance with
religious law.
Through a mostly implied disap-
proval, it seems that the world of pro-
gressive attitude regards religious
orthodoxy as unintelligent, outdated,

exclusionary and judgmental.
Take, for example, the reaction
to a letter an orthodox Rabbi issued
to Sarah Silverman two weeks ago,
which has since gone viral. In the
letter - which comes as a response
to Silverman's "Let My People
Vote" YouTube video - Rabbi Yaa-
kov Rosenblatt performs a laugh-
ably flawed psychoanalysis of the
comedian. He tells Silverman that
the reason she has "trouble forging
a permanent relationship" with a
male partner, something which he
dubs as "the most basic desire of
the feminine soul," is a result of her
crude treatment of sex.
As much as we may entirely dis-
agree with Rosenblatt's arguments,
the commenters on the site ridicule
him - and implicitly, anyone else
who adheres to traditional religious
teachings - as "archaic" and "igno-
rant." This replaces the appropri-
ate task of tackling the argument's
actual points. It's this attitude that
provides the basis of the issue of
academic "intolerance" of the reli-
giously observant to arise.
That said, however, there's a very
apparent basis here for a resistance
to traditional religious thought.
Rosenblatt's argument resists an
emerging discourse as an integral
player in the academy: feminism.
A frequently cited criticism of
observant religious tradition is the
apparent lack of equality between
the roles of women and men. Reli-
gious authorities will sometimes
respond to these criticisms by
explaining that the roles of men
and women in their respective reli-
gions are not unequal, but different.
However, many, certainly those
concerned in protecting women's
rights, see no distinction between
"different roles" and inequality.
Another point of contention
between liberal academia and cer-
tain traditional religious doctrine is
their differing attitudes to expres-
sions of sexuality. The University
offers a number of courses dedicat-
ed to gender and sexuality studies.
The ideas promoted in these classes
are often at odds with many strict

religious dogmas.
The fundamental disagreement
between those who participate in
women's and gender studies and
those who adhere to a dogmatic faith
- which rejects those very discours-
es - undoubtedly creates tension.
And, an understandable basis for the
opposition of liberal academics to
stringent religious doctrine exists;
it's ultimately unjustified - maybe
even hypocritical.
Religion doesn't
have to be at odds
with progressive
movements.
A defining aspect of progressive
academics is acceptance - of dif-
ferent races, backgrounds, sexual j
orientations and faiths. Extending
that same acceptance to a commu-
nity of people whose beliefs differ
from their own, but whose behavior
is respectful and understanding,
would seem only logical.
Furthermore, Rabbi Rosenblatt
is not representative of the whole.
In fact, many who lead a religiously
orthodox lifestyle are also commit-
ted to the ideas of progressive aca-
demia, even if the two aren't 100
percent compatible.
There are plenty of religiously
observant people who believe in
progressive politics, such as same-
sex marriage and a woman's right
to choose. Being religious doesn't
necessarily equate with being dis-
criminatory.
The resolution of this issue is not
difficult to achieve. It lies in one of
the University's own mottos: expect
respect. If we abide by the progres-
sive practice of respecting different
perspectives, we can relieve this
feeling of discord on campus.

"entrepreneur" should extend
to more University alumni than
notable innovators such as Larry
Page, the co-founder of Google, or
Dick Costolo, CEO of Twitter.
"Arthur Miller, the playwright.
He's just as much of an entrepre-
neur as Larry Page," Christopher
said. "And that's what we're about,
making big changes in whatever
field."
The final portion of the meet-
ing was reserved for brainstorm-
ing. While this was only the first
gathering of the members, there
was an abundance of ideas for the
commission.
Engineering sophomore David
Fontenot of MHackers - a rela-
tively new student organization
suggested that the Entrepreneur-
ial Commission should organize a
national conference and competi-
tion for student hackers, program-
mers and entrepreneurs.
Fontenot predicted that the

amount of students looking for a
national "hackathon" competi-
tion is so high that an event like
this would come up organically,
whether at the University or
another campus.
"I think there's extreme inter-
est for this event," Fontenot said.
"It's going to happen in the next
six months. I.think it should hap-
pen at Michigan and I think that
this Entrepreneurship Commis-
sion can make ithappen."
Thomas H. Zurbuchen, the
associate dean for entrepreneur-
ship programs, also attended the
meeting and said there is immense
untapped potential in entrepre-
neurial pursuits stemming from
student collaboration.
"We're a school that can do
amazing things. Many of the
things we individually can do ...
others can also do," he said. "What
we can do together, nobody can do
(as well)."


"Sorry for the confusion.
Despite my best efforts to pro-
tect anonymity, apparently
there are additional 'tabs' on
excel spreadsheets that change
methods of viewing," Berk
wrote in the e-mail sent to the
class. "We take protecting your
rights very seriously, and this
error has been resolved."
The original spreadsheet is
still accessible on the CTools
announcement that automati-
cally is sent to students' Uni-
versity e-mail addresses.
LSA junior Ryan Jacobs, a
student in the class, said he was
creating the donkey's bottom
half and legs.
"When I would say I didn't
know how much influence (the
logo) could have, they said, 'Oh
no, it would definitely do a lot,
because I always see those fliers
and I always know what's going
on, even if I don't attend,"' Brill,
an LSA junior, said. "That made
me realize that people see our
stuff even if they aren't regular
members."
Among those who have
noticed and admired the group's
advertising are the group's top
political rivals - the University's
chapter of the College Republi-
cans. .
The College Democrats' logo
and brand name have developed

initially unaware of the error
and is unsure as to how stu-
dents will react.
"Frankly, I'm kind of sur-
prised," Jacobs said. "I'm sure
there are students that are
upset about it because, you
know, not everyone did well on
that exam".
Berk said he deeply regrets
the entire incident.
"I would hope that students
would understand that it was
100 percent clerical error, not
intentional," Berk said. "I feel
terrible about this - I take this
stuff very seriously."
over years as the group makes
every effort to keep them ubiqui-
tous, chair Brill said in an inter-
view outside the group's office,
which she said was crowded with
T-shirts, clipboards and paint for
banners.
Though Jankowski said she
knows reforming the College
Republicans' brand will not be an
overnight phenomenon, she hopes
the beginning of the process will
be her legacy as chair.
She added that Republican
presidential nominee Mitt Rom-
ney's recent surge in the polls
has accelerated the group's
efforts by energizing the club
and bringing in new members.
"We're working hard to put
together that look about us."

Piersante said.
Officials reported a number of
comparative statistics that reveal
last year's crime trends. The
number of breaking and entering
incidents is up 60 percent this
year with 32 - last year only 20
were reported. The number of
sexual assaults has also jumped
from 6 last year to 16 this year.
The total number of crimes this
month is up 98 percent compared
to last October. Total crime this
year is up 32 percent from this
time last year.
The meeting specifically
focused on a recent increase in
larcenies - 131 percent for the
month of October. In the past
28 days, there have been a total
of 83 larcenies, whereas during
the same period last year, there
were only 36. As a whole, larce-
nies are up 35 percent in com-
parison with 2011.
DPS spokeswoman Diane
Brown said after the meeting
she believes the recent spike in
larceny is related to an increase
in the amount of drugs in cir-
culation in the Ann Arbor area.
Brown explained that some-
one who steals a Macbook may
exchange it with a drug dealer
for illegal substances.
Since Jan. 1, a total of 113
laptops have been reported sto-
len - Macbooks accounting for
more than one-half of comput-
ers taken. The majority of thefts

Graduate Library, the Shapiro
Undergraduate Library and
the Duderstadt Center. There
have been 38 reported thefts in
Hatcher, 19 in the UGLi and 11lin
the Duderstadt Center.
On Monday, University Police
arrested a 49-year old man
unaffiliated with the University
for attempting to sell a laptop
stolen earlier in the day, Brown
said in an earlier interview.
The owner of the laptop, a stu-
dent, found a post on Craigslist
advertising a computer similar
to his laptop. Officers arranged
to meet the suspect to purchase
the computer, and arrested him
upon contact. The laptop was
recovered.
In addition to laptop thefts,
bicycle thefts have also
increased. A reported 94 bikes
have been stolen since Jan. 1,
whereas throughout the entire-
ty of last year, only 69 thefts
were reported.
In addition to personal elec-
tronics, DPS now allows stu-
dents to register their bicycles.
DPS Sgt. Gary Hicks said he
believes the registration pro-
grains are crucial in preventing
future thefts, noting that if an
item is registered, "chances are,
it won't get stolen."
"Our job is to try to prevent
this from happening," Hicks
said. "We decided after looking
long and hard that we have this
laptop registration program,
and none of the laptops that
were stolen were registered. So
we upgraded the laptop regis-
tration program, and in addition
... we decided to start register-
ing bicycles as well."

Tigers fall inGame 1 route to Giants

Sandoval powers
San Fran. to 8-3 win
with Series-record
three home runs
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
With three mighty swings, Pablo
Sandoval put the San Francisco
Giants ahead in this World Series
and put himself in a class with
Mr. October.
Sandoval hit three home runs
and joined Reggie Jackson,
Babe Ruth and Albert Pujols as
the only sluggers to do it in the
Series, and the Giants jolted Jus-
tin Verlander and the Detroit
Tigers 8-3 on Wednesday night
in Game 1.
A rollicking AT&T Park crowd
- a sea of black and orange out-
fits - roared as Sandoval con-
nected in his first three at-bats.
Popular in the Bay Area as the
Kung Fu Panda for his roly-poly
shape, he went 4 for 4 and drove
in four runs. A Giant panda for
sure. -
From start to finish, it was
basically a perfect game by the
Giants. Coming off a Game 7 win
over St. Louis on Monday night,
they looked totally fresh.
"We played our last game only
two days ago," Sandoval said.
"We're still hot. We just came
here and played our game."
Verlander, the reigning Cy
Young winner so dominant in
this postseason, looked uncom-
fortable from the get-go and con-
stantly pawed at the mound.
As fans filed out singing along
with Tony Bennett's standard "I
Left My Heart in San Francisco,"
the final score raised a nagging
question for manager Jim Ley-
land and his favored Tigers: Did
too much rest after a playoff
sweep of the Yankees mean too
much rust?
Tagged by Sandoval for a solo
shot in the first inning, Verlander
could only mouth 'Wow!' when
the Giants star launched a two-

run drive in the third that set
off another blast of fog horns.
Sandoval reprised his power
show from this year's All-Star
game, when his bases-loaded
triple highlighted a five-run first
inning against Verlander.
And if there was any doubt
that Verlander was shaky, the
best sign came in the fourth.
That's when pitcher Barry Zito, a
career .099 hitter, sliced an RBI
single with two outs off the cur-
rent AL MVP for a 5-0 lead.
The festive crowd stood
and applauded when it was
announced that Verlander was
being pulled for a pinch hit-
ter in the fifth. Sandoval gave
them another reason to get up
moments later when he hit a solo
homer off reliever Al Alburquer-
que in the fifth, answering the
cheers by waving his batting hel-
met in a curtain call.
The Tigers seemed out of sorts
in their first game following a
five-day layoff. That was an issue
in 2006, too, when Verlander and
his teammates had nearly a week
off before getting wiped out by
the Cardinals.
"I'm one that's been around
long enough to know that a lot of
things happen in this game. This
was a big-hyped game with Jus-
tin, probably a lot of pressure on
him," Leyland said.
"But I don't think it had any-
thing to do with the pressure.
His fastball command was not
good. He got out of sync. He got
on fast forward. He just did not
pitch well tonight. It's that sim-
ple," he said.
Pujols homered three times
last year, Jackson accomplished
the feat in 1977 and Ruth did it in
1926 and again in 1928.
For good measure, Sandoval
lined a single his last time up. He
donated the bat he used for the
first two homers to the Hall of
Fame - no need for it anymore,
he broke on the backswing of his
second shot.
Sandoval is one of a record
nine Venezuelans on the Series

rosters, and his power perfor-
mance attracted attention way
beyond the ballpark.
"There goes the third! Pablo
makes history," Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez tweeted
in Spanish.
Left off the 2010 World Series
roster by the champion Giants,
Zito shut out the Tigers until Tri-
ple Crown winner Miguel Cabre-
ra hit an RBI single in the sixth.
The Giants won for the 14th
straight time with Zito starting.
"Just the opportunity alone
was mind-blowing. Me and my
wife were dancing around when
I heard," Zito said of getting the
Game 1 start. "And then the boys
came out swinging and played
great defense."
NL championship series MVP
Marco Scutaro hit RBI singles
after doubles by Angel Pagan.
NL batting champion Buster
Posey contributed two hits, left
fielder Gregor Blanco made div-
ing catches to rob Cabrera and
Prince Fielder, and Tim Lince-
cum came out of the bullpen to
prevent further damage.
Game 2 is Thursday night,
with Doug Fister starting for the
Tigers against Madison Bumgar-
ner.
The Giants kept getting good
bounces, with Pagan hitting a
double that hopped off the third-
base bag. ALCS MVP Delmon
Young, meanwhile, failed to run
after a tapper in front of the plate
that the Giants turned into a
double play.
Pitching in San Francisco for
the first time since 2008, Ver-
lander scuffed at the rubber
while warming up for the first
inning, pulled off his glove after
badly overthrowing a curve and
kept taking deep breaths. He
hardly resembled the guy who
was 3-0 with an 0.74 ERA in
three playoff starts this year.
Ever since two poor outings in
the 2006 Series against St. Louis
- punctuated by two throwing
errors - Verlander has worked

hard to harness his emotions
and 100 mph heat in the early
going.
Verlander was trying to settle
in when Sandoval tagged him,
pouncing on an 0-2 fastball and
lining it into the front row over
the center-field wall. Quite a
start for the team that finished
last in the majors in home runs.
Get this: It was the first
three-homer game at the stadi-
um originally known as Pac Bell
Park since the very first one,
when Kevin Elster did it for the
Dodgers in 2000. Nope, not even
home run king Barry Bonds had
done this.
It was certainly a moment of
retribution of Sandoval. He was
benched during the 2010 World
Series, his production and con-
fidence down, his weight up. In
the stands on this night, fans
wearing furry panda hats cel-
ebrated with him.
Verlander got into trouble
again the third, and pitching
coach Jeff Jones strolled to the
mound when the count went
to 2-0 on Sandoval. Verlander
stared at Jones and shook his
head. On the next pitch, Ver-
lander could do little but watch
the ball sail into the front row
in left.
To some, this looked some-
what similar to the 2010 Series
opener. That day, the Giants
beat up the supposedly unhit-
table Cliff Lee on their way to a
five-game romp over Texas.
This is how bad it got for the
Tigers: Former closer Jose Val-
verde made his first appearance
in 11 days. Leyland still isn't sure
what he'll get from the strug-
gling reliever.
Lincecum, meanwhile,
retired seven straight batters
and struck out five of them. The
two-time Cy Young winner has
embraced his new role in the
bullpen.
Jhonny Peralta hit a two-
run homer for the Tigers in
the ninth off mop-up reliever
George Kontos.

Ex-Goldman executive given
two years for insider-trading

Gupta gave
information to
hedge fund boss
NEW YORK (AP) - A former
Goldman Sachs and Procter &
Gamble Co. board member was
sentenced to two years in prison
Wednesday, culminating a spec-
tacular fall from grace for a man
whose good deeds worldwide
brought him leniency after he was
convicted of feeding inside infor-
mation about board dealings to a
billionaire hedge fund owner who
was his friend.
Rajat Gupta, 63, of Westport,
Conn., learned his fate from U.S.
District Court Judge Jed Rakoff,
who defended the length of the
prison term he levied, blasting
federal sentencing guidelines that
he said called for Gupta to serve
at least 61/2 years behind bars. He
also ordered him to pay a $5 mil-
lion fine.
Citing information he received
under seal, Rakoff said Gupta's
crimes may have occurred because
Gupta may have "longed to escape
the straightjacket of overwhelm-
ing responsibility, and had begun
to loosen his self-restraint in ways
that clouded his judgment."

The Harvard-educated busi-
nessman long respected on Wall
Street was one of the biggest
catches yet for the federal govern-
ment in its five-year crackdown
on insider trading that has so far
resulted in 69 convictions.
Gupta was ordered to report to
prison on Jan.8.
Reading from a statement, he
said: "The last 18 months have
been the most challenging period
of my life since I lost my parents as
a teenager.
"I regret terribly the impact
of this matter on my family, my
friends and the institutions that
are dear to me. I've lost my reputa-
tion I built for a lifetime. The ver-
dict was devastating."
The dealings by Gupta that
were highlighted at his spring trial
stemmed from his relationship
with Sri Lanka-born Raj Raja-
ratnam. The one-time billionaire
hedge fund boss controlled up to
$7 billion in accounts, giving him a
firm footprint in the financial mar-
kets and influence that impressed
someone as widely regarded as
Gupta.
"His conduct has forever tar-
nished a once-sterling reputation
that took years to cultivate," U.S.
Attorney Preet Bharara said after
sentencing. "We hope that others

who might consider breaking the
securities lawswill take heed from
this sad occasion and choose not to
follow in Mr. Gupta's footsteps."
Prosecutors described how
Gupta raced to telephone Rajarat-
nam with stock tips sometimes
only minutes after getting them
from board conference calls, help-
ing Rajaratnam make more than
$11 million in illegal profits forhim
and his investors. Rajaratnam is U
serving an 11-year prison sentence
after his conviction lastyear.
The narrower insider trading
case against Rajaratnam and his
co-conspirators resulted in 26
convictions and was described
by Bharara as the biggest insider i
trading case in history, success-
ful in part because of unprec-
edented use of wiretaps more
familiar to juries at mob and drug
trials.
Prosecutors say Rajaratnam
earned up to $75 million illegally
through his trades while Gupta's
attorneys point out that their cli-
ent earned no profits.
At trial, Gupta was convicted
of three counts of securities
fraud and one count of conspir-
acy, insider trading charges that
prosecutors said should result
in a prison sentence of up to 10
years in prison.

Palestinian moumners grieve in the family home during the funeral of the body of Hamas militant Loay AbuJarad in Beit Lahia, northemn Gaza Strip,
WednesdayOct.24, 2012.
Gazans blast Israel with
rockets, draws airstrikes

Heaviest bombing in
months, retaliation
threats begin
JERUSALEM (AP) - Hamas
militants in the Gaza Strip fired
dozens of rockets and mortar
shells into southern Israel on
Wednesday in the heaviest bom-
bardment on the area in months,
drawing ominous Israeli threats
of retaliation and dangers of
escalation.
The violence came a day after
a landmark visit to Gaza by the
emir of Qatar. Israeli officials
suggested the visit, the first by a
head of state to the Hamas-ruled
territory, emboldened the mili-
tant group.
The rocket fire began shortly
after the emir left Gaza late Tues-
day and continued through the
night. Israeli officials said more
than 80 projectles were fired,,
and Hamas claimed responsibil-
ity for many of the attacks.
Israel responded with a series
of airstrikes on rocket launch-
ers, killing two Palestinian mili-
tants, according.to Gaza medical
officials. Two other Palestinians

were killed Tuesday.
Three Thai laborers working
on an Israeli farm were wound-
ed, two seriously, when a rocket
hit a chicken coop. Other rockets
badly damaged five houses and
broke car windows. Schools in
the area were closed.
Many people spent the day
indoors, while others stayed in
close proximity to the make-
shift cement shelters found in
the streets of southern Israeli
towns. In one farming commu-
nity, shrapnel covered trees and
a children's playhouse in a back-
yard.
"Sometimes it feels like a
scene out of the movie 'Platoon,'
something out of the Vietnam
war. We can stay at home and
just hear the noise of the war,"
said Tamara Cohen, a resident
of the border community of Ein
Habesor whose children, ages 9
and 5, spent the night in a forti-
fied "safe room" in their home.
A video issued by Hamas' mil-
itary wing showed six rockets
peeling off in rapid succession,
then later, from what appears
to be a different location, eight
rockets shoot off, leaving plumes
of black smoke behind them.

Hamas said the video

Washington's success lies in
refining his hand technique

Michigan penalty
kill perfect this fall

By BEN ESTES
Daily Sports Editor
When you introduce yourself
to Quinton Washington, a hand-
shake is something of an impos-
sibility,- the nose tackle's paws
are so enormous that a normal-
sized hand just gets swallowed.
of course, his hands are just'
part of a body that itself is many
times larger than the average
22-year-old's. At 6-foot-4 arid
300 pounds, Washington has the
ideal build for a space-eater in
the middle of a defensive line.
In his redshirt junior season,
having seized a starting spot for
the first time in his career, Wash-
ington is beginning to put that
sizable frame to use.
It was a surprise for most
when Washington appeared
atop the nose tackle depth chart
before the season opener against
Alabama. After last season, the
Michigan coaching staff had
slid defensive end Jibreel Black
over to three-technique defen-
sive tackle, and it was assumed
that he and senior Will Campbell
would man the two spots in the
middle, with Campbell at nose
tackle.
But Washington came on
strong in camp. His emergence
allowed Michigan coach Brady
Hoke to put Campbell at the
three-technique and insert
Washington at the nose, giving
him the type of bulk in the inte-
rior that Hoke deems necessary
for the Big Ten.
Washington had big shoes to
fill - he's replacing Mike Mar-
tin, a four-year contributor who
was voted the Wolverines' top
defensive lineman in each of the
last three seasons before being
drafted by the Tennessee Titans
this year.
"I knew that I would have to
work all offseason because Mike
was gone," Washington said. "I
was the next person in line, and
if I really wanted it I had to work.
One thing with Coach Hoke, he's
not just going to give you the
position. He's going to make you
work for it.

Redshirt junior Quinton Washington has been a pleasant surprise this fall.

"It was a surprise when he
put me in (at the top), but I just
embraced it and ran with it."
Hailing from St. Stephen, S.C.,
Washington arrived at Michigan
as a touted recruit - a four-star
offensive line recruit, according
to Rivals.com. He was signed by
former coach Rich Rodriguez in
2009 to play guard. There was
even a thought that Washington
would be able to step in and play
right away, a rarity for offensive
linemen.
It didn't happen. After taking
a redshirt his first season, Wash-
ington couldn't crack the field in
2010 either, and halfway through
that campaign, Rodriguez moved
then-defensive tackle Campbell
to the offensive line and switched
Washington over to defense.
When Hoke arrived before
last season, Campbell was moved
back to his original position.
Washington remained at defen-
sive tackle, a position he didn't
play in high school. Despite
his inexperience there, he was
intrigued by the opportunity.
"It was really exciting to try

something new," Washington
said. "Being an offensive line-
man, it was coming along really
slow, so it was kind of getting
frustrating and I just wanted to
try something new. It's seemed
to be a pretty good turnout."
Still, Washington wasn't
exactly a natural at his new spot.
The technique is completely dif-
ferent on either side of the line
- offensive linemen try to get
in close and drive the opponent,
while defensive linemen try to
extend their arms, lock out and
shed the blocker - and Washing-
ton admitted he initially strug-
gled with the switch.
It's still a work in progress,
but one much further along than
when Washington made the
switch two years ago. After a
year spent behind Martin, Wash-
ington has the full focus of the
defensive coaches, and three of
them - Hoke, defensive coor-
dinator Greg Mattison and line
coach Jerry Montgomery - have
experience coaching the defen-
sive line.
The coaching attention has

improved Washington's tech-
nique, especially with his hands,
by leaps and bounds since fall
camp began.
But strength remains the nose
tackle's best attribute. If you ask
his teammates, Washington's
power is apparently prodigious.
Campbell called him an "ox."
Senior defensive end Craig Roh
called him a "beast."
"(Against Illinois), he actually
got in my way a little bit," Roh
said."I'mhavingto deal with two
guys, because he's just throw-
ing them over to me. He literally
threw guys. That's a 300-pound
guy throwing 300-pound guys.
It's something pretty fun to see."
"At first (the transition) was
hard because of my hands, but
one thing I did know how to
do was just come off the ball,"
Washington added with a wry
smile.
Roh and Campbell both also
commented on how much better
Washington's hands have been
this season, and Hoke seem-
ingly mentions Washington's
improvement every week. This
season, Washington's technique
has finally begun to work in con-
cert with his natural strength.
The combination has turned him
into a solid player for Michigan's
defensive line - which, along
with the defense as a whole, has
been steadily improving since
some early struggles.
"There's times now where you
see him play a block, and you go,
'Boy, that's perfect!' " Mattison
said. "And like any player, now
we have to do it play after play
after play. ... But Quinton has
really worked hard. He's bought
into everything. I'm happy for
him."
With his natural talent, it
appears Washington's ceiling
is as high as his hands will take
him.
His strides, though, are evi-
dent, even off the field. After you
finish your conversation with
him and follow him to the exit,
he stops to hold the door for you
- his arm is fully extended, just
as his coaches would want.

Three games into its season,
the Michigan hockey team has
yet to allow a power-play goal.
The penalty kill is a perfect
10-for-10. Include the two four-
on-fours Michigan has endured
and it becomes 12-for-12.
But what has been the secret
to the Wolverines' success on the
penalty kill?
"Everyone doing the little
things," said junior defenseman
Mac Bennett. "People are getting
in front of shots, gettingthe stick
on the puck. They are where
they're supposed to be. They're
snapping back and circling, just
doing the little things is allowing
us to be successful."
The players that typically
play on the penalty kill take that
to heart. They tend to be the
grittiest, scrappiest players on
the ice because of the constant
hammering the opposing team's
power play inflicts.
Though mainly defensive, the
penalty-kill unit consists of four
players who are not all defen-
semen. Michigan coach Red
Berenson said that on the typical
penalty kill the Wolverines will
rotate at least four defensemen
and six forwards.
Of the normal penalty killers,
Berenson highlighted the perfor-
mance of junior forward Derek
DeBlois and sophomore forward
Travis Lynch.
Bennett echoed Berenson.
"They suck to play against in
practice because they're pesky,"
he said. "We've seen it in games."
Though Michigan has scored
only one short-handed goal so
far show this season, it came at
a pivotal time during the second
meeting with RIT, when Lynch's
goal gave the Wolverines a 2-0
advantage.
"Not only does it motivate
when guys are out there blocking
shots, killing penalties and get-
ting us back to full strength, but
obviously times two when they're
out there scoring goals," said
junior forward Luke Moffatt.
Berenson added some other

aspects of the penalty kill that
he has seen so far to be a driving
force in the success of the unit.
With faceoffs constantly occur-
ring in the defensive zone, he said
winning the draw is crucial to
clear the ice from the get-go. He
also referenced the importance of
the forecheck to either force the
opposing team to dump the puck
in the zone orto froce a turnover.
And the goalie is always there
to man the last line of defense.
"If there is a breakdown, then
your goalie has got to be able to
make a save," Berenson said. "He's
got to be your bestpenalty killer."
Despite the question mark that
has been lingering in the net so
far, freshmen goaltenders, Steve
Racine and Jared Rutledge, have
played their part on the kill unit.
They might be inexperienced,
but that hasn't been completely
noticeable during opposing power
plays.
One of the biggest struggles for
goalies during the penalty kill is
to maintain possession and keep
soft rebounds from finding the
back of the net.
Both Bennett and Moffatt ref-
erenced the importance of being
"disciplined" during the penalty
kill, and that is exactly what the
Wolverines have been. After the
first loss to RIT where the Tigers
tallied seven power plays, the
players have fared much better.
Berenson said that some of the
younger players have also found
themselves playing significant
roles, including freshmen for-
wards Andrew Copp and Justin
Selman and sophomore forward
Zach Hyman.
"It's great that our penalty kill
has been so good this year, but we
don't want to put them in situa-
tions in big games where we are
down," Moffatt said. "It's just
pressure situations and we just
need to play more disciplined
like we have been the last couple
of games and, work off that to
become even better."
Though it is likelythatthe per-
fect streak for the penalty kill will
come to an end in the near future,
the current success is a welcomed
sight so early in the year.

Freshman leaves her mark in How Rick Pitino almost
Ann Arbor byway of Ireland almost coached at 'M'

By DYLAN McKENZIE
DailySports Writer
For freshman Aisling Naugh-
ton, playing for the Michigan
field hockey team was far from a
certainty, but the team is ecstatic
that it became reality.
Naughton, who hails from
Goatstown, Ireland, has been a
notable asset for the Wolverines
and is leaving her mark in her
first season. The defensive back
is second on the team in goals (7)
and third in points (18) and she's
been named Big Ten Freshman of
the Week twice.
"She's electrifying," said
Michigan coach Marcia Pan-
kratz. "And that sets a tone for
our team."
While she plays with the com-
fort level of a veteran, it's Naugh-
ton's international journey
that reveals poise and maturity
beyond her years.
As a high school senior,
Naughton didn't plan to attend
Michigan or even head to the
U.S. for college.
"I had no plans to come to
America, but in December (2011)
I thought about it," she said. "In
March, a spot opened up and I
signed my letter of intent. ... By
this time last year I thought I'd
still be in Dublin."
Perhaps it was the luck of the
Irish for Michigan that the spot
was available, because Naughton
has been one of the team's top
players all seasonlong. After hav-
ing a quick change of heart and
choosing to cross the Atlantic for
college, a culture shock could be
expected. But that hasn't affect-
ed her play.
"I had never made an official
visit so when I got off the plane
August 8th, it was a bit scary,"
Naughton said. "But the girls

Louisville head
coach says he
couldn't contact
Michigan A.D.
By MATT-SLOVIN
Daily Sports Editor
Rick Pitino, the head coach
of the Louisville men's basket-
ball team, told SiriusXM's Bas-
ketball and Beyond radio show
on Wednesday that he was
extremely close to taking the,
head coaching job at Michigan
a decade ago.
"I was fired up to be the
coach at Michigan," Pitino
recalled.
"My wife came up - she just

didn't want me to go to the west
coast, UNLV, and be away from
the children," Pitino said. "She
agreed, 'Okay, let's go to Michi-
gan."
But Pitino went on to say that
when Louisville came calling,
his wife questioned him for his
unwillingness to return to the
Bluegrass State, where he had
previously coached at Kentucky
from 1989-97 and winning a
national title in 1995-96.
In March of 2001, Pitino,
who now has 616 career vic-
tories, took over at Louisville,
where he's since led the Cardi-
nals to two Final Fours.
Had then-Michigan ath-
letic director Bill Martin not
been out of the office on some,
well, not-so-official business, it
might not have gone down that

way.
"I tried to call the A.D. at
Michigan (Martin) between 12
and 1," Pitino said Wednesday.
"I had a false name. I would
give him a fake name, and he
would call me back. I couldn't
get ahold of him because he was
playing squash. The secretary
said that he demands that he
doesn't get interrupted unless
it's an emergency and if you
wantyou can leave avoicemail.
"I left a voicemail and went
to Louisville and I'm really
happy I did."
Martin and Michigan ended
up hiring Tommy Amaker after
Pitino detoured to Dixie. Amak-
er lasted six seasons, accumu-
lating a 108-84 record before
current coach John Beilein took
over in 2007.

Freshman Aisling Naughton has adjusted well to life in the United States

have been absolutely lovely. ...
The team's been like a family."
The Wolverines' large interna-
tional presence likely helped in
her transition. Michigan has six
international players from vari-
ous areas of Canada and Europe
who have created an atmosphere
where homesickness doesn't
affect the team's play.
"You want tobe home because
you feel like you're missing out a
little bit," Naughton said. "When
I look where I am, though, I'm
really glad I'm here."
Pankratz added: "Without
question, there's some adjust-
ment and we try very hard to
make them feel at home."
Naughton's ability to take such
drastic life changes in stride
and continue to pour in goals is
impressive. But her abilityto suc-
ceed while having to learn the
intricacies of the American game
is perhaps more notable.

While the core of the game
is similar regardless of which ,
side of the Atlantic you play on,
Naughton concedes that there
are large differences in the
American game.
"It's really attacking, it's
constantly go, go, go," she said.
"There's. a huge emphasis on fit-
ness and the intensity in gen-
eral."
Her physical gifts certainly
make the transition easier, as
Pankratz called her' the team's
"fastest player,"
Naughton continues to shine
even with the obstacles working
against her. With her bolstering
the back line, Michigan has been
able to continue its strong play
from last year despite fielding
such a young team.
The future is bright for both
Naughton and the Wolverines,
and it's all because of a change of
heart from a year ago in Ireland.

Back on the pitch, Jaffe plays a big role

By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Writer
Right hand bouncing against
the wall, left foot twisting back
and forth, Emily Jaffe leaned up
against the outer brick wall of the
U-M Soccer Complex, enjoying a
sun-soaked afternoon.
Just two days after scoring
on her second header in as many
games - the first one being a
game-winningtallyagainstMich-
igan State in overtime on Oct. 10-
the 5-foot-6 senior midfielder was
all smiles.
Sheepish from all of the atten-
tion she had received, the Ann
Arbor native blushed incessantly
and goofily smiled as she reflect-
ed on a collegiate career that had
come full circle.
Not too long ago, she had
walked away from the game.
Playing high school soccer
right in Michigan's backyard,
Jaffe asserted herself for Pioneer
High School. She was a three-
time All-Conference and a three-
time All-District selection, as well
as a .Division-I All-State selection
after her junior season.
"She was poetry in motion,"
said Chris Morgan, who coached
Jaffe at Pioneer until her senior
year. "She was always trying to
execute and she was a very cre-
ative player. She dedicated herself
to the team. She was just a joy to
watch because she worked so
hard."
Jaffe worked tirelessly year-
round. She would show up to
practice early and tried to stay
late, asking Morgan for more
drills. She battled through inju-
ries, spending a great deal of time
with the team trainer but never
enough time to take herself off the
field.
"There was a point, actually,
where we had to tell her to stop
working so hard," Morgan said.
"She was training so much that
she was doing more harm than
good."
The work paid dividends,
thoughf x'ig various chjipgs

started calling. Morgan said he
jokingly tried to persuade her to
choose Michigan or Michigan
State so that he could watch her
play. Though becoming a Wol-
verine would have been the easy
choice, Jaffe wanted to go some-
place new, a school far enough
away from home where she could
grow independently.
With a connection to Iowa's
women's soccer coach Ron Rain-
ey, who she had met through
the U.S. Olympic Development
Program, and a love for the cam-
pus in Iowa City, she decided on
the Hawkeyes. Before first-year
Michigan coach Greg Ryan ever
had a chance to see her play, Jaffe
had committed to Iowa.
"By the time (Ryan) came in
and started recruiting players, I
felt like I wanted to be commit-
ted," she said. "It was the high
school rush."
But the midfielder's time with
the Hawkeyes was short-lived.
Midway, through the 2009 sea-
son, Jaffe no longer wanted to
play soccer. Playing a significant
role off the bench for Iowa during
her freshman season, she quit the
team after just eight game appear-
ances.
"I think I got really burnt out
on soccer," Jaffe said. "To be at
this level, for a lot of girls, that's
all they do in high school and
middle school. I felt like I needed
a little more variety in my life and
balance, so I gave up soccer and
found some other things that I
was interested in."
Added Morgan: "It didn't
surprise me that she burnt out
because she played 24/7. We
would always tryto getherto take
time off between club and high
school and training on her own
because her body was just getting
beat up. It didn't surprise me that
she had to walk away from the
game for a while."
Though disappointed that he
had lost a talented player halfway
through the collegiate season,
Rainey said he understood the
decision.
"We talked about it," he said.
"You want your athletes to be
"enjoying themselves. You've got

as soon as the 2011 club season
began and she began playing soc-
cer again, Jaffe could no longer
ignore the itch.
"I definitely missed the com-
petitive level ofplay," Jaffe said. "I
felt like I couldn't find something
in my life to compete at."
Just two weeks into the club
season, she contacted the varsity
coachingstaff.
Jaffe finally landed a midsea-
son tryout on Tuesday, Sept. 20,
nine games into the Wolverines'
season.
During the midfielder's first
practice with the Michigan wom-
en's soccer team, Ryan split his
team into two squads so that the
Wolverines could play a posses-
sion game. He put his starters in
the game that he was watching
and he put Jaffe with the rest of
the team in the game that assis-
tant coach Angela Napoli was in
charge of watching.
Ryan walked over to Napoli to
get her thoughts on the new addi-
tion.
"What did you think of Emily?"
Ryan asked.
"She'll be starting on Friday,"
Napoli replied.
The next day, Ryan placed Jaffe
with the starters so that he could
gauge her ability for himself.After
the game, he went back to Napoli.
"You're right, she's starting on
Friday."
Three days after joining the
Wolverines, the transfer found
herself in the starting lineup at
midfield against Minnesota.
But since that game, her time
with the Wolverines has been a
real rollercoaster ride. After start-
ing the next six contests, Jaffe
missed the final three games of
the season following an appen-
dectomy.
Entering the 2012 season, Jaffe
found herself in the starting line-
up once again, but after 12 games,
she was relegated to the bench.
"We talked about it," Ryan said.
"She felt that she was ina little bit
of a slump and we talked about it
being easier for her coming off the

Her minutes slowly dipped
and three games later, she found
herself on the bench for all of
regulation as the Wolverines bat-
tled Michigan State to overtime.
Looking to inject life into the
team, Ryan substituted her in at
the beginning of the extra period.
Ten minutes later, the midfielder
found herself in the middle of a
celebration pile after heading in
the game-winning goal, the first
score of her career.
Five days later in Michigan's
2-0 victory against Purdue, with
the monkey off her back, Jaffe
came in off the bench and headed
in another corner kick.
She attributed her time away
from the game to her recentresur-
gence.
"These past few weeks I was in
a slump," Jaffe said. "But instead
of just digging myself deeper, and
deeper in a hole, I could step back
and re-evaluate and see that I
should just be playing to enjoyit."
Now, with just a few weeks left
in her career, the senior saidshe is
just trying to appreciate her time
on the field.
"I'm not trying to think about
the end because I don't really
want to face being done," Jaffe
said. "Especially with taking
some time off, I wish I could have
it all back."
Jaffetried to take an extra year
of eligibility, but the NCAA ruled
thatherseasonwiththe clubteam
in 2010 counted toward her four
years. They also ruled that her
seven games withtheteam in 2011
were too many for her to ask for a
medical redshirt.
Though Jaffe will end her col-
legiate career earlier than she
would like, Morgan is just happy
that his former player was able
to rekindle her passion for soc-
cer and find a second chance with
Michigan.
"For everything that she has
done for the game, helping other

With more free time, Jaffe said
that she started exploring other
interests that were a lot less "self-
involved." She became passionate
about environmental studies. She
started to volunteer in the com-
munity, and even began tutoring.
For the first time in as long as
she could remember, she wasn't
playing soccer - and she was
enjoying it.
"It allowed me to step back and
get a little more perspective, and
see that soccer isn't the center of
the universe," Jaffe said.
With her determination to play
soccer at a competitive level gone,
there was nothing keeping her at
Iowa. She decided to transfer and
head home.

Upon transferring, Jaffe made
the choice not to contact the wom-

instead, settled on playing for the
less-competitive clubsoccer team.
But within weeks, she had
urges to contact Ryan to try to
play for the varsity team.
"I thought about it a lot," Jaffe
said. "I thought about contacting
Greg because I was getting my
passion back, but I stepped back
and decided notto."
The club season ended and,

ARTS RECOMMENDS
In this feature, Daily Arts writers will give their endorsements
for the arts you need to experience to help you deal with current events.
"The Walking Dead"
AMC's hit TV series "The Walking Dead"
wields such a dramatic and twisty plotline, only
one other work could best it: the graphic novel
series of the same name. Used as the inspira-
tion and source material for the show, the story
is as unpredictable as a hungry wayward zombie.
Packed with action, conflict and gruesome sur-
prises, the series is a must for the amateur zombie
MAGE COMIcS enthusiast.
Halcyon - Ellie Goulding
After breaking into the mainstream with radio
sensation "Lights," Ellie Goulding is back with a
second studio album, Halcyon. Unlike the lighter,
sweeter crooning Goulding produced on Lights,
the singer explores the darker side to her music,
getting weird and far-out on tracks that do well
to showcase her voice. Backed by synth beats and
pop undertones, Halcyon is a good stepping stone
for Goulding's career, as well as a fun, worthwhile
POLYDOR listen.
" "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"
For anyone doubting director Shane Black's
capacity to take over the "Iron Man"series, perhaps
you should check out the filmmaker's dark comedy
from 2005, "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang." Starring Robert
Downey Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan,
snarky noir perfectly blends elements of hardboiled
pulp with humorous jabs at the dark world of Holly-
wood. Clever and biting, it's a clear demonstration
WARNER BROS of Black's curious voice.
"Alias"
Though people still have debates about "Lost"
at parties, J.J. Abrams's spy-action hit "Alias" too
deserves revisitation. Jennifer Garner is Sydney
Bristow, whose life starts to unravel when she
becomes a double agent. Victor Garber and Ron
Rifkin give stellar performances. Even Bradley
Cooper proves impressive as the laughably naive
Will Tippin. With a disturbing pilot, "Alias" wastes
Aec no time pulling you into its intricate web.

They' are our first signs of indepen-

of deceit and intrigue, a suspenseful
epic that would later be continued in
the hit series "Kyle XY."

be unnecessarily caught up in "Opposites Attract" por-

trays the inexplicable attraction
between Abdul and Skat Kat, who
was dubbed "the greatest rap-
ping animated cat in the history
of pop music," by Rolling Stone.
The two are head-over-heels for
each other, but they couldn't be
more different. "You like the mov-
ies and I like TV," Abdul croons.
"But when we get together it just
all works out,"the two sing inuni-
son. Call it some kind of lesson in
love.
Though it has been more than
20 years since Abdul and Skat Kat
first introduced viewers to their
dysfunctional relationship, the
Grammy-winning music video
still resonates due to its distinct
flavor of ingredients - what can
go wrong when you combine an
animated rapping cat, synthe-
sized '80s beats and a tap number
worthy of Gregory Hines or Savi-
on Glover (long before a penguin
named Mumble tapped his way
into our hearts, I might add)?
There are, of course, the nay-
sayers, critics who will tell you
that this tender relationship is
farfetched, too unrealistic to ever
actually exist in the real world.
"She 'moves slowly' and 'likes it
quiet' whereas he 'moves fast' and
'likes to shout,' " they might say.
"It'll never work out." Yet look
at Democratic and Republican
political pundits James Carville
and Mary Matalin: The couple is
happily married and as "opposite"
as can be.
What I'm trying to say is that
"Opposites Attract" exempli-
fies a crucial aspect of modern
relationships: the fact that two
individuals from different walks
of life can still make each other
happy. At times, this can be easy
to forget. After all, in an age
when names such as Brangelina,
Bennifer and Jelena fill tabloid
headlines, it can feel as though
you're prescribed to find your
significant other within your
cohort. But according to Abdul
and Skat Kat, romance is found
in the unlikeliest of places, a
message of hope for lovers every-
where.

Eco-conscious METAL

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

Stern and Walters
forge community
for metallurgy
ByJULIA KLINE
For the Daily
METAL is a world of strik-
ing contrasts. Large imposing
machines crowd its fabrication
studio in Ann Arbor. There is a
plasma cutter, a sandblaster, a
milling machine for the textur-
izing of metals and a "break" that
bends and shapes metal parts.
A whimsical tin-man sculpture
greets entrants to the shop. Mel,
a large metal T-Rex, grins atop
the plasma cutter. These daunt-
ing devices are all industrial
machines that have been repur-
posed from industrial machines
to create works of art.
METAL, located on Felch
Street, is a metalworking studio,
gallery, classroom and venue for
performance. Since its open-
ing in 2011, owners Claudette
Jocelyn Stern and John Daniel
Walters have used the space to
create and display metal art.
Metalworking is energy-
intensive and is not tradition-
ally an environmentally friendly
endeavor. Yet environmental-
ism lies at the core of the craft
at METAL. Owners Stern and
Walters united in this shared
passion.
The duo first met at an iron
pour in Tucum Cari, New Mex-
ico in 2006, both driving envi-
ronmentally friendly vehicles.
Walter's car had been rigged to
run on cooking grease, while
Stern's ran on bio diesel. A few
years after their first meeting,
Walters moved to Ann Arbor
for graduate school to study
art. Shortly after attaining his
degree, he conceived METAL
with Stern, an Ann Arbor native.
" Since the studio's opening in
2011, other creative individuals
have sought out Stern and Wal-
ters, intent on becoming part of
the METAL family. Andrew Kyt
came to practice forging and
blacksmithing and singer-song-
writer Sarah Carroll joined the
METAL team as administrative
and marketing director.
Carroll said people of all
artistic backgrounds can find
inspiration at METAL.
"People really enjoy coming
in here and just being inspired
by art, whether it be interior
designers, or graphic designers,

METAL will be offering a class on tintyping on Oct. 27 and 28.

or poets, or dancers, they just all
are inspired," Carroll said. "And
I think it's because art really
does transcend all those areas."
METAL also serves as an edu-
cational forum. On Oct. 27 and
28 METAL will hosta workshop
on tintype photography, an art
form with a strong metal con-
nection that involves creating
colloidal prints on metal surfac-
es. Tintype became popular in
the 1860s and was used exten-
sively for portraits throughout
the 19th century.
METAL itself came from re-
purposing and salvaging: The
light fixtures are relics from the
old Ice Cube skating rink; the
walls once comprised the ceiling
of an old gallery.
Stern said she frequently
travels to Michigan's Upper
Peninsula and out west in search
of found materials for METAL's
creations, noting that she first
became intrigued by found
materials as a small child in
southern California.
"There was so much debris
that would wash up. on the
beaches," Stern said. "You could
always find rusty bits of old
freighters that washed up or
other debris, and for me it was
just really fascinating.",
Walters heads project man-
agement, which involves over-
seeing each step of production
- from design to the final prod-
uct. Walters explained how he
takes a client's vision and helps

it come alive in metal. He added
that environmentalism takes a
top priority in his work.
"As a core component of my
belief, when I make something I
want it to last a very long time,"
Walters said. "That means a lot
to me and it sort of solidifies
the effort which I put into the
object."
As a result of METAL's non-
traditional environmental con-
cerns, many of the patinas used
to coat the metal art are water-
based instead of being made
from toxic chemicals.
In addition to its environmen-
tal bent, Sterndescribes METAL
as "devoted to the idea of com-
munity." To this end, METAL
provides a venue for other forms
of artistic expression. A band
performed in its studio, and the
poetry group, One Pause Poetry,
calls the studio its home.
During One Pause perfor-
mances, the fabrication studio is
transformed into an auditorium
with folding chairs and a small
stage. Poets including Univer-
sity professors Ken Mikolowski
and Matthew Rohrer perform
at METAL. During a recent
performance, Rohrer shared
dream-like verses written in
the hypnagogic state between
sleeping and waking, while
Mikolowski charmed the crowd
with his wry two-line poems.
Before making METAL its
permanent home, One Pause
held its readings in a barn on

Liberty Street. Rohrer recalled
with a laugh that Pulitzer prize-
winning poet, Tracy Smith, read
her poetry in a tent in the barn,
adding that he likes the commu-
nity-oriented feel METAL gives
to the readings.
"Poetryis often presented in a
classroom setting or an academ-
ic setting," Rohrer said. "That's
fine, but poetry is bigger than
that. It predates it. Here we can
come together with the commu-
nity at large in an art setting."
METAL's commitment to
community extends far beyond
the boundaries of Ann Arbor
and even the United States.
After the devastating 2011 tsu-
nami, members of METAL and
other local artists met to discuss
how they could support the Jap-
anese community.
"The Japanese decided that
what they needed was an event
to encourage children to con-
nect with art and use it as a vehi-
cle for some amount of healing
after that tragedy and trauma,"
Stern said.
The artists auctioned pieces
off to benefit the cause, using
their creativity as a catalyst for
global healing.
METAL is many things to
many people: an environmental-
ly friendly metalworking shop,
a teaching space and a venue
for creative expression. Stern
said the contrasts and oppo-
sites present at METAL come
together to create its intriguing
character.
"My business partner and I
are opposites in a lot of ways,"
Stern said. "But the oppositional
aspects create a whole that real-
ly makes METAL a supremely
interesting place and gives us a
lot of possibilities."
Stern also sees a unifying
theme in the disparate elements
of metal.
"Making (art) or making a
business work is all the same to
me," Stern said. "It takes vision,
it takes hard work, and it takes
planning and it also takes a lotof
kismet. But more than anything
it takes the right chemistry of
people and their willingness to
work through a lot just like you
do in any family or relationship."

HAPPENING
From Page 1B
The movement originated in
the United Kingdom during the
1980s, but drifted to the U.S. dur-
ing the emergence of techno in
Detroit.
Today, in Ann Arbor and else-
where, warehouse parties have
become a hybrid of DJ-driven
music and art installations.
Roughly six years ago, Ann
Arbor-based art collective Forth
From Its Hinges threw its first
warehouse party. Originally, co-
founder Sam Haddix wished to
display his artwork on the walls
of the local coffee shop Elixir
Vitae Coffee and Tea. But after
being informed of the shop's
three-month waiting list, he
decided to create his own show.
Near the Ann Arbor Airport
on Plaza Drive, the exhibition
featured a variety of art medi-
ums including paintings, instal-
lations, short films, live music
and DJs. The event was free, and
open to all ages. After the success
of the first showing, Forth From
Its Hinges organized a handful
of other Happenings in the same
space.
After drifting apart over the
years, certain members of Forth
have assisted with the most ,
recent warehouse party to arrive
in town: SHADOW/SHADOW.
"The event is not only about
curating Ann Arbor art, but hav-
ing a lot of fun with it," Joshua
Bay, a musician featured in the
show, said.
In early September, Architec-
ture and Urban Planning senior
Olivia Vander Tuig co-organized
SHADOW/SHADOW, which was
promoted as an art show and
dance party. The event featured
local artists, DJs and musicians,
including Bay, a University alum
who goes by Known Moons.
Bay takes "having a lot of fun"
to heart in his performances as
he sometimes plays the guitar
with aviolin string.
SHADOW/SHADOW took
place in a 7,000-square-foot
space located in an isolated area
on Main Street. The warehouse
had been used as Penny W.
Stamps School of Art & Design
faculty studios from 1998 until
November 2011.
While the show was supposed
to operate as a place of artistic
freedom and celebration, there
were was a $5 cover, a 21-and-up
age requirement and a dress code
of all black.
Still, the event brought a con-
temporary spin to the warehouse
scene.
"We drew a lot of our inspira-
tion from the Detroit warehouse
party, where people would go set
up for a night and go until they
got kicked out," Vander Tuig
said.

goes to (the University's con-
certs) besides the Music School
students."
With a lack of facilities to
showcase experimental art in
Ann Arbor, ComphouS provides
a homey, accepting turf for new
sounds. Johnson, who is also part
of the, musical collective GRL
MTN, said the collaboration of
people and sounds can tap into
unexplored harmonies.
"We are trying to have some-
thing where electronic musicians
play and then, at the same time,
have some classical music going
on, too," he said. "And then try
to combine these two different
worlds that are separate."
Inthe computer
"I think the Internet is really
helping to facilitate our music
scene," Johnson explained. "Peo-
ple are listening to each other's
music online who didn't know
each other in person and then
deciding to meet up."
Due to developments in tech-
nology, these contemporary
Happenings are taking on new
forms in Ann Arbor. The Inter-
net is used as a connecting forum
for artists. GRL MTN and local
band Chrome Sparks even found
a bandmate ina chat room.
In a generation consumed by
social media, there are new and
meta ways of promoting, creating
and preserving Happenings.
LSA senior Cory Hearns
attends local concerts and shoots
interestingly crafted short films.
"I was inspired by this French
blog, La Blogotheque," Hearns
said. "Whenever bands come
through Paris, they film these
very grainy one-take videos of
bands playing in obscure places."
Hearns uses this approach to
create his own film technique.
"I just bring my camera, and at
certain moments I click record,"
Hearns explained. "I won't stop
until the song is finished."
After the shows, Hearns posts
the videos on various social
networking and media web-
sites. Artists greatly appreciate
Hearns's films since they act as
artistic forms of preservation and
even as promotion.
The Internet and film are
innovations that allow for art to
be created, accessed and shared
faster than ever. Many art critics
believe that new media further
blurs the line between the artist,
the artwork and the viewer.
The movement
With the University's ameni-
ties, cultural institutions and
valued public art, Ann Arbor
prides itself on its creative cul-
ture. Below this topography lies
an energetic community that
is redefining how people' view
and experience art. This group
