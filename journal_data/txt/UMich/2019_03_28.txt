If a University of Michigan 
student looks at their online 
ballot for Central Student 
Government today, they’ll 
see Engineering sophomore 
Dylan Haugh-Ewald’s name 
listed as a candidate under 
the category of Executive 
Ticket. 
But 
Haugh-Ewald 
said he was not aware of 
his candidacy status until 
the ballot was released to 
University students at 12:00 
am on Wednesday.
Haugh-Ewald 
said 
he 
did 
originally 
intend 
on 
running for CSG president. 
He 
decided 
to 
attend 
a 

meeting 
regarding 
CSG 
elections when he received 
an email from the University 
Electionsw 
Commission. 
Haugh-Ewald said he saw 
the opportunity to run for 
CSG president as an avenue 
to pursue goals he had for 
the University, specifically 
regarding 
open-sourcing 
more 
course 
material 
through 
public 
online 
platforms available to non-
university-enrolled students.
“I see Central Student 
Government 
involvement 
as one avenue that could 
work for the goals that I 
want to achieve within the 
University and any influence 
I want to have,” Haugh-
Ewald said.

Students, staff offer input on strategic plan to increase diversity and inclusion on campus

ALEX HARRING
Daily Staff Reporter

On 
Wednesday 
night, 
approximately 40 students and 
faculty met in Couzens Resi-
dence Hall for the University of 
Michigan Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion Town Hall.
Jad Elharake, a program lead 
in the Health Equity & Inclu-
sion and DEI offices, started 

the event by thanking Diversity 
Peer Educators for acting as 
hosts and explaining the goal 
of these events.
“We wanted to be very 
intentional in hearing your 
experiences 
as 
students,” 
Elharake said. “It’s an oppor-
tunity for you all to give your 
big ideas.”
The University is in the 
middle of its five-year DEI 
Strategic Plan, which was 

launched in October 2016. 
The plan was created in part 
as a response to student 
activism, specifically the 
#BBUM movement on Twitter 
and 2013 protests by the Black 
Student Union. The initiative 
promised $85 million over five 
years and included campus cli-
mate-related training, the cre-
ation of the re-located Trotter 
Multicultural Center and new 
recruitment strategies. 

The DEI plan’s language 
made connections to histori-
cal social movements on cam-
pus, including Black Action 
Movement and debates over 
affirmative action in the last 
decade. 
Student 
activists 
protested the plan at a DEI 
keynote as part of the launch 
because they felt the stu-
dent voice was not properly 
accounted for.

Jad Elharake, Graduate Intern at the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, gives introductory remarks at the second DEI Town Hall in 
Couzens Hall Wednesday.

On 
Wednesday 
afternoon, 
about 15 students and faculty 
gathered in the Harlan Hatcher 
Graduate Library Gallery Lab for 
a talk by Luciane Ramos Silva, 
co-editor of O Menelick 2o Ato, an 
editorial project in Brazil aiming 
to highlight Afro-Brazilian artists, 
thinkers and perspectives. In her 
talk, titled “Voices of the Black 
Press in Times of Social Cleavage 
in Contemporary Brazil,” Silva 
discussed racial disparities and 
the importance of a platform for 
Black creators in Brazil. 
Silva began by describing Brazil 
demographically, 
explaining 
Brazil faces many issues of 
inequality 
despite 
its 
racial 
diversity.
“54 
percent 
of 
Brazil’s 
population is Black, but it has one 
of the worst statistics in racial 
disparities in terms of education, 
employment, living conditions,” 
Silva said. “It has some of the 
worst statistics in terms of death 
of young Black men, of mass 
incarceration against Black men, 
of sexual violence against Black 
women, opportunities for Black 
students in universities, et cetera.”

Wednesday night, the Univer-
sity of Michigan’s Central Student 
Government and Division of Public 
Safety and Security collaborated 
to host a town hall regarding plans 
to improve emergency safety pro-
tocol following an active shooter 
scare on March 16. A small group 
of community members voiced 
concerns about accommodations 
for disabled students and possible 
improvements to the emergency 
alert system.
CSG President Daniel Greene, 
Public Policy senior, said he was 
glad the entire University commu-
nity was given a place to express 
their 
opinions 
regarding 
the 
events.

“We were concerned that non-
student leaders — so the major-
ity of campus — didn’t have the 
opportunity or platform to voice 
their concerns and ask questions,” 
Greene said. “We wanted to make 
sure that although CSG already 
has the connections and was able 
to have this kind of dialogue that 
other community members were 
able to have the same opportunity 
to do so.”
Greene said he wanted to pro-
vide ample opportunity for all 
community members to engage 
in a dialogue about how DPSS will 
adjust moving forward.
“Although tonight’s attendance 
was a bit more intimate in style, I 
think it was still an opportunity 
for the students that did show up 
to be able to ask the questions that 

otherwise fall by the wayside,” 
Greene said.
DPSS Executive Director Eddie 
Washington fielded many of the 
students’ questions. He reiterated 
multiple times his gratitude for the 
feedback he has received from the 
campus community.
“You have expectations, high 
expectations,” Washington said. 
“We share the ‘leaders and the 
best’ philosophy, and we don’t 
believe we can be that if we’re 
not constantly looking at ways to 
improve.”
Washington 
reassured 
the 
group that DPSS is putting togeth-
er an “after-action briefing,” a 
process which requires an inter-
nal and external review of the 
situation and how it was handled. 
Washington said the briefing 

requires different facets of DPSS 
to convene and agree, so the offi-
cial document is not yet published 
but soon will be.
“That will be transparent, and 
that will be something that we 
make 
available,” 
Washington 
said. This briefing will address 
concerns brought up by students, 
staff, faculty and other commu-
nity members who were affected 
by the active shooter scare: action 
taken by officers on the scene, use 
of the emergency alert system and 
areas where improvement is pos-
sible or necessary. Washington 
said his primary takeaway from 
the conversations he has had with 
students is that DPSS needs to 
be “doing more than what we’re 
doing today.”

the 
Trotter 
Distinguished Leadership Series, 
the Trotter Multicultural Center 
hosted University of Michigan Law 
Professor Barbara McQuade and 
Kathryn Dominguez, public policy 
and economics professor, for a 
discussion on Women in Leadership 
on Wednesday night. About a 
dozen students gathered in Palmer 
Commons for the second event 
of the speaker series focusing on 
political issues and public service. 
McQuade previously served as 
the U.S. attorney for the Eastern 
District of Michigan after being 
appointed by President Barack 
Obama and was the first woman 
to hold the position. Dominguez 
is a published author, research 
associate at the National Bureau of

discussion by asking the women 
about what sparked their interest in 
public service and what advice they 
would give to women interested in 
entering this field.

How do you stay creative 
on a traditionally academic 
campus?

I struggled a lot this winter 
being in primarily studio 
classes. The deadline didn’t 
care if I was sad or tired 
— I was sun deprived and 
unmotivated. Color is so 
important to me and looking 
outside to see such little 
contrast between the grey 
sky and the grey ground was 
tough... Staying creative here 
isn’t as hard as I thought it 
would be. Being a freshman, 
there’s many things to address 
through my artwork. It’s just a 
year of change and art really 
helps me work through it. I 
definitely meet many people 
who don’t understand that my 
studio classes are just as labor 
intensive as academic classes, 
if not more, but it’s easy to 
runaway to North Campus 
where everyone gets it.

UAAO event discusses colonization 

United Asian American Organizations event confronts impacts of colonialism 

SONIA LEE
Daily Staff Reporter 

Wednesday 
night 
at 
the 
South Quad Residence Hall Yuri 
Kochiyama Lounge, the United 
Asian American Organizations 
(UAAO) hosted a panel on how 
colonialism, 
specifically 
in 
Southeast Asia, has impacted the 
Asian/Pacific Islander American 
community. Around 50 students 
attended 
the 
event, 
titled 
“Effects and Representations 
of Colonialism: SE Asia,” which 
was hosted in collaboration 
with the Vietnamese Student 

Association, 
the 
Filipino 
American Student Association 
and 
Burmese 
students 
on 
campus. 
Established in 1988, UAAO is 
an umbrella consortium whose 
member groups include multiple 
Asian/Pacific Islander students 
organizations on campus. In 
addition to acting as a liaison 
between these groups, UAAO 
hopes to promote the voice of 
A/PIA students on campus, 
build relationships with other 
people of color groups and raise 
awareness on A/PIA issues.
 The event was discussion-

based, 
with 
the 
UAAO 
Programming 
Chairs, 
LSA 
sophomores Fareah Fysudeen 
and Cristina Guytingco, showing 
attendees clips from films and 
video analyses of American films 
representing Southeast Asians. 
After each clip, students got in 
small groups or pairs to discuss 
the impact of the films.
One clip students watched, a 
YouTube video entitled “Slaying 
the Dragon: Reloaded,” was 
about the portrayal of Asian 
and Asian-American women in 
Western films like “Rush Hour 
2,” “Memoirs of a Geisha” and 
“Charlie’s Angels.” 
Guytingco 
said 
the 
portrayal of Asian women in 
media continues to be one-
dimensional.
“A lot of the depictions of 
South Asian, Asian-American 
women is very monolithic, like 
we’re this one thing and we’re 
not anything else,” Guytingco 
said. “It’s like we’re this cool, 
edgy, 
purple-streak 
Asian 
character. So there’s not a lot 
of complexities of how Asian 
women are portrayed.”
The students also examined 
“Apocalypse 
Now,” 
a 
film 
which uses the war in Vietnam 
as its setting and compared it 
with Vietnamese film “Cô Ba 
Sài Gòn” (“The Tailor”) which 
depicts a Vietnamese woman’s 
attempt to learn a French style 
of tailoring despite her family’s 
rejection of anything French 
post-colonization.
Fysudeen, who first watched 
“Apocalypse Now” in high 
school, said what disturbed her 
most about the film was its use 
of Asian characters to propel 
the story of white men.
“It was really, really, I don’t 

know, horrifying to me, the 
depiction of Asian bodies in 
this film,” Fysudeen said. “And 
how they were just kind of used 
as a device to get to this really 
interesting psychology of this 
white man.” 
Students viewed a YouTube 
video, “Apocalypse Now: Crash 
Course 
Film 
Criticism 
#8” 
of “Apocalypse Now” where 
a film analyst discussed the 
psychological aspects of the 
film, as well as the use of Asian 
characters. 
Public Policy graduate student 
Thom Pham said one part of the 
video he appreciated was the 
commentator’s 
differentiation 
between Vietnam itself and the 
war that occured in Vietnam. He 
noted Vietnam is often used as 
an exciting background for the 
stories of white people.
“I liked in the video where it 
said American War in Vietnam, 
because I like to say the War in 
Vietnam,” Pham said. “Some 
people just refer to the war itself 
as ‘Vietnam’ or even just ‘Nam’ 
when it’s really a country … I 
think the movie really was, if 
anything, not about Vietnam. 
It’s about the test of war and 
Vietnam just happened to be the 
background. It’s kinda bullshit.”
In a larger group discussion 
about the films, Business senior 
Kevin 
Steward 
highlighted 
the confusion people feel in 
countries which were colonized 
by Western powers when it 
comes to keeping popular foods, 
fashion and trends — which 
sometimes 
come 
from 
the 
colonizer.

Silva noted Black people have 
a long history in Brazil due to 
the Black diaspora, the global 
displacement of people of African 
descent due to slavery between 
the 1500s and 1900s. According 
to Silva, having a space for Black 
culture is necessary in order 
for Black people to contribute 
to 
conversations 
about 
this 
diaspora.
“What is the meaning of 
diaspora as a Black Brazilian, 
or a Black American, or Black 
African?” Silva said. “Art is a 
way to approach the struggle 
of Black people in Brazil, and 
how our experiences connect 
with other narratives of the 
Black diaspora … In an unequal 
society, culture is a basic need. 
Art is a demonstration of the 
possibility of society.”
Silva 
then 
presented 
on 
the work of O Menelick 2o 
Ato. According to Silva, the 
independent magazine is the 
only printed media in Brazil 
specifically focused on Black 
culture and creators. Started 
in 2010, O Menelick 2o Ato 
publishes articles, essays, artist 
and activist profiles, poems, 
photographs and illustratrations 
of and by Black artists.
According to Silva, more than 
40,000 copies of O Menelick 
2oAto have been distributed in 
São Paulo, its base of operations, 
and throughout Brazil, as well 
as internationally in the U.S., 
Europe, Asia and Africa.
Silva explained O Menelick 2o 
Ato is a non-profit organization 
that distributes copies of the 
magazine for free in order to 
reach a wider audience.
“We 
distribute 
for 
free, 
because the community that we 
focus on, they don’t have money 
to pay for a magazine,” Silva said. 
“We work mostly through public 
grants … we apply for private 
grants … We have a community 
of writers and thinkers (who) 
believe it is necessary to do this 
work. Sometimes we have to put 
in money ourselves.”
Though print editions are 
more expensive than online 
media, 
Silva 
expressed 
O 
Menelick 2o Ato is committed to 
publishing in print.

“The capacity to read and 
understand and really learn with 
the page is very much different 
from online,” Silva said. 
Silva explained the name of 
O Menelick 2o Ato translates to 
“O Menelick Act 2” in English 
and is a tribute to O Menelick, 
the 
first 
Black 
journal 
in 
Brazil established in the 1915 
which closed in the mid-1900s 
when it was unable to sustain 
production. According to Silva, 
this is an acknowledgement of 
the history of Black press in 
Brazil.
In 2018, O Menelick 2o 
Ato was selected as a Prince 
Claus laureate, a Dutch award 
established in honor of Prince 
Claus and supported by the 
Dutch 
Ministry 
of 
Foreign 
Affairs. According to a report 
from the Prince Claus Funds 
Committee, O Menelick 2oAto 
was honored for its work in 
increasing Black representation 
in Brazil, among other reasons.
To 
end 
her 
talk, 
Silva 
expressed her belief in the 
power of art to shape culture.
“Even though Black (people) 
are more than 50 percent of the 
population, Blacks are othered 
in Brazil,” Silva said. “But we 
still fight as our elders, mostly 
because we believe in the power 
of the creative imagination … 
As an artist and anthropologist, 
it makes me comfortable to 
communicate 
that 
culture 
and art is a way to experiment 
and feel and develop critical 
perceptions about society.”
Frieda Ekotto, professor of 
comparative 
literature 
and 
Afroamerican 
and 
African 
studies, attended the event. 
Ekotto said in an interview with 
The Daily after the event that 
the work of O Menelick 2o Ato 
is important as it serves as an 
archive of Black thought and 
expression.
“This 
is 
a 
place 
where 
we can collect and excavate 
knowledge,” Ekotto said. “And 
that knowledge is not there. 
There’s a need to document this 
history, Black culture, Black arts 
… It’s extremely important that 
other generations will go back to 
the archive to see that this work 
is being done.”

Haugh-Ewald couldn’t attend 
the CSG executive ticket debate 
on March 18 due to a scheduling 
conflict with an exam. 
“I signed up and I attended the 
meeting and then I couldn’t make 
the presidential debate because I 
had an exam at the same time, but 
that wasn’t an issue from what I 
understand, it wasn’t a critical part 
of the campaign,” Haugh-Ewald 
said. 
According to Haugh-Ewald, 
when the University Election 
Commission sent out the sample 
ballot on March 21, he was 
listed as a candidate for College 
of 
Engineering 
representative, 
rather than the CSG presidency he 
thought he’d signed up for. 
Haugh-Ewald 
immediately 
emailed the election committee 
once he noticed the error, but said 
they never responded.
The Daily reached out to Law 
student Victoria Allen, CSG’s 
Election Director, for this article, 
but she said she was unable to 
comment on the incident until the 
conclusion of the election. 
The sample ballot included an 
area for candidates to write their 
campaign platform. Because at 
that point he assumed his position 
on the ballot would not be changed 
from Engineering representative 
candidate 
to 
presidential 
candidate, Haugh-Ewald wrote 
“I won’t let you down” in lieu of a 
longer platform. 
He said he was not notified 
his position had been changed 
to 
presidential 
candidate 
by 
the election committee until he 
noticed his name on the ballot on 
March 27. 
“My initial impression attending 
the first meeting was that they (the 
election committee) were a little 
disorganized and they weren’t 
entirely able to answer some of 
the questions about hard rules and 
campaigning,” Haugh-Ewald said. 
“By the time they had changed 
the election I was in the system, 
I couldn’t go in and upload any 
platform, and they didn’t notify 
me that they had changed which 
election I am in until I noticed 
today (Wednesday) that I was 
indeed a presidential candidate.”

Haugh-Ewald said he again 
emailed the election committee 
March 27 to ask if he could add a 
platform late but was told he was 
not able to. Haugh-Ewald said this 
was the first time the committee 
responded to him since he emailed 
them six days before.
Although his platform is not 
included on the ballot, if elected, 
Haugh-Ewald said his biggest 
initiative would be open-sourcing 
more course material to unenrolled 
students 
to 
make 
education 
more accessible. He discussed 
using certificates from learning 
platforms such as Coursera to help 
students earn their degrees.
“The vast majority of courses 
on the platform are respectively 
developed, but lack any tangible 
coordination 
with 
existing 
university coursework,” Haugh-
Ewald said. “Potential actions to 
this end include the conversion 
of already digitized U-M classes 
into an open-source compatible 
syllabus, 
and 
eventually 
the 
offering of limited exams to 
un-enrolled students. It is critical 
that we as a university recognize 
the equivalency of certain open-
source materials so as to open 
doors for students that would 
normally be unable to sacrifice 
the time and money to obtain a 
traditional degree.”
Haugh-Ewald is joined on the 
executive ticket ballot by LSA 
sophomore Ben Gerstein and LSA 
junior Isabelle Blanchard of the 
Engage Michigan party, running 
for president and vice president 
respectively, and Engineering 
freshman 
Shub 
Argha 
who 
is running independently for 
president. When reached by The 
Daily, the candidates said they 
are not allowed to comment on 
Haugh-Ewald’s situation until 
the polls close tonight at 11:59 
p.m. 
LSA junior Jacob Inosencio said 
he noticed Haugh-Ewald’s name 
on the election ballot but did not 
recognize his name. He said he has 
heard other students who believe 
his campaign is a joke because of 
the singular sentence included as 
his platform on the ballot.
“I think people should definitely 
have the opportunity to have their 
platforms put on there,” Inosencio 
said. “You want to be informed 
about who you’re going to vote for.”

LSA interim dean Elizabeth 
Cole wrote in an email to The 
Daily this event, as well as the 
previous DEI events in the 
series, are opportunities for 
faculty to gauge student input 
and a chance for students to 
give feedback about the Uni-
versity and LSA-specific DEI 
plans.
“I encourage you to attend 
one of these sessions,” Cole 
wrote. “The university is at the 
midway point of the campus-
wide five-year DEI Strategic 
Plan, and this is an opportu-
nity to check in on progress. 
These 
Student 
Community 
Conversations are a chance 
for you to give feedback to the 
U-M administration that will 
help shape the future of the 
U-M and LSA DEI plans, and 
of our work together.”
Rob Sellers, chief diversity 
officer and vice provost for 
equity and inclusion, empha-
sized at the event the impor-
tance of student voices and 
explained the reasoning for 
the strategic plan’s creation 
and continuing dialogues dur-
ing his speaking portion of the 
meeting.
Sellers said DEI plays a 
vital role in the success of the 
University, adding that it is 
important the University feels 
accessible and comfortable for 
all students. According to Sell-

ers, the DEI plans are “living 
documents” that can change 
over time. 
He also noted the University 
has 51 different plans for dif-
ferent administrative units, in 
addition to a University-wide 
plan.
“Instead of having a single 
plan, the University of Michi-
gan has done it very differ-
ently,” Sellers said. “Those 
plans — and the fact that each 
unit has a plan — was a way for 
us to reinforce the idea that 
diversity, equity and inclusion 
isn’t something that simply 
resides in the President’s office 
or reside in the Chief Diversity 
Officer’s office, but it is a core 
aspect of who we are as a uni-
versity.”
Sellers also tied diversity to 
institutional success. He said 
DEI helps all students feel like 
they can reach their potential 
and belong at the University.
Sellers said the University 
has made progress from when 
DEI was first created and is 
more proactive than it has 
been in the past in relation to 
diversity issues, but there is 
still work to be done.
“It took us 200-plus years as 
an institution to get here and 
it’s not going to change com-
pletely in five years,” Sellers 
said. “I will tell you we’ve made 
a great deal of progress and … 
we are not the same institution 
that we were three years ago. 
I will also equally state we are 
not where we need to be.”

A student inquired about a 
report from the University of 
Southern California released 
in September that gave the 
University an F grade on over-
all racial equity among public 
universities. The student asked 
if the University has acknowl-
edged the report and if it has 
prompted any changes.
Specifically, the report gave 
the University an F in repre-
sentation of Black students on 
campus, who make up 4.4 per-
cent of undergraduates student 
population. 
The 
University 
received a C grade for its Black 
graduation rate, which is 12.1 
percent lower than the overall 
completion rate.
Sellers pointed out the part 
of the report focused on the 
graduation rate is complicated 
because the University’s grad-
uation rate is higher than the 
national average. He said the 
study was important, but found 
its analysis simplistic because 
it looked at graduation rates 
between populations rather 
than compared to national 
averages.
“We do have a problem of 
graduation rates as a func-
tion of ethnicity here at the 
University of Michigan and 
we are continuing to work to 
change that,” Sellers said. “If 
we would have had really, real-
ly poor graduation rates across 
the board, we would have got-
ten an A. It didn’t take into 
consideration that our gradu-
ation rates are so high across 

the board.”
Students shared ideas with 
present faculty members dur-
ing different portions of the 
event. One included crowd-
sourcing ideas through ice-
breaker and writing activities 
and through small-group facil-
itation. The final event is on 
April 2 from 7:00 to 8:30 p.m. 
in Rackham Assembly Hall.
Information senior Chalse 
Okorom helped facilitate stu-
dent discussions as a Diversity 
Peer Educator. She said it is 
important to have the events 
so student voices can be heard.
 “We’re the most populous 
people on campus,” Okorom 
said. “If faculty is making 
changes, then I think that this 
is the best way for them to 
get that input or those ideas 
instead of just coming up with 
it on their own.”
Katrina Wade-Golden, dep-
uty chief diversity officer, said 
at the conclusion of the event 
that the feedback from stu-
dents will be considered going 
forward as the University pre-
pares for the fourth year of 
the initiative and beyond. She 
thanked the students in atten-
dance for their time and input.
“Many of the items that got 
positioned in our original plan 
came through from events 
like this,” Wade-Golden said. 
“We are really happy that you 
shared the gift of your ideas 
and we will be taking those 
ideas under advisement as we 
prepare.”

liaison to Student Life in the pre-
vention and community engage-
ment 
department, 
reassured 
students those improvements will 
continue to come from within his 
department.
“You’ll see a lot more proac-
tive communication through the 
remainder of the semester from 
prevention and community out-
reach within DPSS,” Baker said.
Baker has facilitated numer-
ous events on behalf of DPSS since 
the scare occurred. Last week, he 
spoke at a CSG meeting, a Resi-
dence Hall Association meeting 
and a town hall with Rackham 
students. Baker has also contrib-
uted to an ongoing DPSS initiative 
to register students for the emer-
gency alert system.
DPSS is exploring new avenues 
to improve their emergency com-
munications after receiving exten-
sive student complaints regarding 
the timeliness of alerts. 

LSA senior Niccolo Beltramo 
raised the issue of the timing of 
alerts at the town hall.
“Specifically with regard to 
sort of the speed of communica-
tion from DPSS … obviously some 
delay is to be expected because 
you all had to check our the situ-
ation and validate, but 30 minutes 
seems like quite a long time in a 
potential active shooter situation,” 
Beltramo said.
Washington 
explained 
that 
during an emergency, when stu-
dents take to their phones to con-
tact friends and loved ones it clogs 
the servers and prevents text or 
email alerts from being received 
by the student body in a timely 
fashion. Washington said DPSS 
advises students to download 
their app because the push noti-
fications are more expedient than 
traditional alert forms. 
Another concern voiced at the 
town hall is the inability of some 
students with disabilities to com-
ply with the run, hide and fight 

protocol the campus community 
was advised to adopt. 
LSA senior Bradley Ebenhoeh 
wrote questions on this issue that 
were asked by his caregiver, Kine-
siology sophomore Natalie Bull-
ock.
“For people with disabilities 
such as myself, many of us cannot 
run, hide or fight,” Bullock said on 
Ebenhoeh’s behalf. “That was eas-
ily the most terrifying part about 
it. It felt like my own school did 
not care about my safety.”
Washington said DPSS has 
been in the process of remedy-
ing this issue by training “capable 
guardians” who would be able to 
provide assistance to all vulner-
able communities in the event 
of emergency. This includes stu-
dents with disabilities, as well as 
children and those hospitalized in 
Michigan medical facilities.
The capable guardians are cur-
rently undergoing training with 
Baker to learn a nuanced proce-
dure to follow during an active 

shooter alert. Instead of running, 
hiding and fighting, they are 
taught to instruct, evacuate, shel-
ter and defend. All doctors, nurses 
and University staff are expected 
to be trained under this new pro-
gram.
Greene said this town hall is a 
way to wrap up loose ends before 
solidifying a final, improved pro-
tocol.
“We have done multiple events 
on multiple fronts over the past 
few weeks, and this is our final 
event,” Greene said. “Tonight 
was the last chance out of a whole 
series of events that provided stu-
dents with the same opportunity 
and the same information to bet-
ter understand what happened 
but also to be able to provide criti-
cisms and provide feedback about 
how we can even better react in 
the future.”
DPSS expressed they are taking 
student feedback into account.
“We have some work to do 
ahead of us,” Baker said.

“Don’t be afraid to ask people … 
to ask about learning more about 
what they do,” McQuade said. 
“They will say yes far more than 
you think they will.” 
When asked about obstacles they 
faced in their careers, Dominguez 
and McQuade discussed battles 
with 
self-confidence 
in 
their 
abilities as women. 
“In many ways, it was my 
own kind of … nervousness about 
not 
really 
having 
particular 
characteristics that were needed 
for particular jobs that held me 
back more than even other people,” 
Dominguez said. 
They discussed the need for 
extra 
self-confidence, 
as 
the 
men around them seemed more 
confident 
in 
their 
leadership 

abilities. Especially when applying 
for jobs and internships, McQuade 
said women tend to underestimate 
their ability to get a position, and 
encouraged 
audience 
members 
to 
have 
more 
confidence 
in 
themselves. 
“Before women will apply for 
a promotion or position, they will 
feel like they have to meet 100 
percent of all the qualifications 
on the list, whereas men apply 
for the job if they meet 25 percent 
of the qualifications on the list,” 
McQuade said. “Don’t let the fact 
that you don’t check all of the boxes 
cause you to eliminate yourself. You 
might bring something to the table 
that other applicants don’t, so don’t 
eliminate yourself.”
LSA junior Emma Hess said in 
an interview with The Daily after 
the event that McQuade’s point 
resonated with her. 

“That’s always how I look at 
internship 
applications,” 
Hess 
said. “I think, ‘Oh, I meet like one 
of these out of the seven that they 
have there, I’m never going to get 
this, I shouldn’t even apply.’ So that 
was like really good advice to know 
that I should just take the chance 
and express my interest in a cover 
letter and hope that they are willing 
to listen.” 
McQuade also spoke about 
workplace 
harassment 
as 
an 
obstacle that most women will have 
to experience. McQuade said while 
these situations may not always 
constitute the “legal definition of 
sexual harassment, they could be 
described as biased incidents.” 
As a woman in a male-dominated 
and, at times, competitive field, she 
discussed needing to decide ahead 
of time how to respond to these 
situations. 

“What are you going to do 
when the moment comes, when 
this happens, because it’s going 
to happen,” McQuade said. “And 
there’s certainly some things that 
are absolutely intolerable and you 
need to stand up and call it out the 
way it is.” 
The speakers discussed the 
women 
who 
inspired 
them, 
speaking to the importance of 
speaking 
their 
minds, 
having 
integrity and remaining “calm in 
the face of a storm.” 
The discussion concluded with 
audience 
members 
asking 
for 
advice on career paths and law 
school. McQuade offered guidance 
on recovering from failure.

Interdisciplinary art is our primary method of social change
I 

was on my way to Mason 
Hall when, out of curiosity, 
I decided to stop inside 
the Samuel T. Dana 
Building, home of the 
School for Environment 
and Sustainability at the 
University of Michigan. 
I 
remembered 
how 
I would always walk 
past this building on 
my way to class and 
how I would think 
about its layout on the 
inside, wondering if it 
was anything special 
since it always felt like one of 
the University’s unique sub-
institutions. After noticing a 
man walk inside without having 
to provide special authorization, 
I committed to my decision 
and followed in his direction. 
What I would come to realize 
after my experience in the 
Dana Building is how often we 
overlook an influential source of 
information: Art.
Once inside, I looked at the 
map for a general atrium area 
that I could explore before 
exiting the building on the 
opposite side to head to class. 
Upon entering Ford Commons, 
my eye was immediately caught 
by what was on the far wall: Five 
large paintings hanging evenly 
spaced, basking in yellow light as 
if in a showcase. One displayed 
a black and white shape that 
curled and weaved like a brain. 
Another 
one 
displayed 
what 
looked like a moonlit evening 
in a swamp, seemingly magical 
yet it felt tarnished. Another one 
showed a stack of logs that laid 
as though they were too damp to 
burn, articulating a charcoaled yet 
washed look. I didn’t know what 
to think of these. They were dark, 
but I could feel their essence of 
beauty and emotion, using black, 
gray, brown and green tones to 
portray themselves as the nature 
that can be seen just outside the 
heart of this city. Looking far to 
the left, I noticed a synopsis and 
found an explanation for this 
peculiarity.
The artist who created these 
is Helen Gotlib, a graduate 
student at the University’s very 
own School of Art and Design. 
She calls her work on display 
“Natural Abstractions,” a title 
she chose as a way to convey her 
liking for recreating ordinary 
objects 
using 
the 
exotic 
visualizations that she has for 

them. Combining the techniques 
of drawing, printmaking and 
mixed media processes, Gotlib’s 
recurring motifs in her 
artwork center around 
the subtle expressive 
beauty 
of 
nature’s 
life cycles. There is 
something 
powerful 
about students having 
the 
opportunity 
to 
display their combined 
passions of art and 
the representation of 
the environment, one 
that becomes mystical 
and enrapturing to their viewers 
as a result. Undoubtedly, this is 
what the curator of this gallery 
had noticed in students and had 
brought to life for that reason.

Sara Adlerstein-Gonzalez, the 
curator of the Art & Environment 
Gallery in the Dana Building, is a 
renowned member of the research 
faculty for the University’s School 
for Environment and Sustainability. 
With an extensive background 
as a visual artist for both local 
and international organizations, 
she has been reaching towards 
her objective to bridge the arts 
and 
environmental 
sciences 
and has been able to create the 
beginning of an interdisciplinary 
space here at this University with 
this gallery. She relishes in the 
idea of embracing different fields 
through collaboration and sees 
the gallery as an effective result of 
that: “We are bringing art to our 
school to strengthen our sense of 
community and facilitate dialogue 
among students, faculty and staff 
in the spirit of green-building 
philosophy.”
The gallery has been ongoing 
since February 2012 and has 
featured more than two dozen 
exhibits since then, displaying 
the artwork done by local and 
national artists whose passion 
for interdisciplinary projects has 
become evident with this gallery. 
The artists have expressed their 

motives for contributing to this 
gallery coincide with Adlerstein-
Gonzalez’s mission statement: 
To 
create 
discussion. 
These 
students, 
professionals 
and 
instructors want their artwork 
to be seen to make the issues 
they care about more apparent 
in daily conversations. Many 
of these artists care just as you 
and I do, only they see that the 
most effective change will occur 
through their medium. If I were 
them, I would say the same.
Currently, 
I 
believe 
the 
University 
is 
undermining 
the talent and the resources 
we have on campus to instill 
the social change that our 
generation is working hard 
to 
create. 
After 
viewing 
the exhibit in the Art & 
Environment Gallery, I could 
feel the impression that the 
display was having on me. 
The professionalism combined 
with the emotion and the 
portrayal 
of 
the 
natural 
world not only made me think 
further about the attributed 
environmental 
issues 
but 
also allowed me to form a 
psychological attachment in 
supporting it.
Even 
though 
I 
deeply 
admired its all-encompassing 
aura, I felt within that it could 
be 
something 
more. 
After 
experiencing this medium of 
expression that had a lasting 
effect on my thoughts and 
my concerns, it felt natural to 
demand that it be projected on 
a larger scale than it currently 
is. I feel that this showcase 
deserves a larger platform, 
and ultimately the University 
hasn’t done enough to draw its 
students towards this medium 
of 
expression 
that 
could 
change their perspectives and 
priorities. I believe that if this 
University wants to achieve 
true positive change in terms 
of implementing a sustainable 
lifestyle into the academic 
body’s 
infrastructure, 
it 
must begin with giving the 
people a reason to want this 
change and it must expose 
the interdisciplinary themes 
between all of the subjects it has 
to offer to create a far-reaching 
drive for collaboration.

M

y first trip to the 
shooting 
range 
was 
a 
formative 
experience. Before 
handling 
firearms 
on 
my 
own, 
my 
parents 
required 
I complete a basic 
gun-safety 
class, 
which 
culminated 
in 
a 
round 
of 
target 
shooting 
with 
single-shot, 
small-caliber rifles 
from the prone position. We 
were guided by a certified 
instructor from the National 
Rifle 
Association, 
who 
instilled in us a reverence for 
the four fundamental rules of 
gun safety: You must ensure 
all guns are always loaded, 
never let the muzzle cover 
anything you are not willing 
to destroy, keep your finger 
on the trigger until your 
sights are on the target and 
identify your target and what 
is behind it. Thanks to this 
foundation, I consider myself 
a responsible gun owner.
It is largely because of 
this experience that I take 
issue with how much of 
the gun debate is currently 
framed by American political 
commentary, on both sides of 
the aisle. The recent massacre 
of Muslim worshippers in 
New Zealand has once again 
invited 
careless 
and 
lazy 
argumentation from Second 
Amendment fundamentalists 
and prominent progressives 
alike. The former erroneously 
characterize all gun control 
policies, 
even 
reasonable 
ones, 
as 
the 
first 
step 
in 
the 
unconstitutional 
disarmament of the American 
citizenry. 
Meanwhile, 
the latter seem convinced 
that 
pushing 
ineffectual 
gun control policies after 
every mass shooting is the 
best 
prescription 
for 
gun 
violence. I’ve seen up-close 
how responsible gun use is 
instilled in a society, so I feel 
confident in saying that these 
outlooks are wrong.
As 
demonstrated 
by 
recent commentary on the 
New Zealand shooting, the 
NRA 
and 
similar 
Second 
Amendment advocacy groups 
relentlessly perpetuate the 
myth that any gun control 
measures 
amount 
to 
an 
“evisceration” of gun rights. 
In fact, the text of the 
Second Amendment grants 
no immunity from reasonable 
restrictions 
on 
the 
sale, 
possession or use of firearms 
— just consult the majority 
opinion of late Supreme Court 
Justice Antonin Scalia, in the 
seminal Second Amendment 
Supreme 
Court 
case 
of 
District of Columbia v. Heller. 
This extreme interpretation 
matters. 
While 
Second 
Amendment fundamentalists 
do not comprise a majority 
of gun owners, gun policy is 
disproportionately swayed by 
pro-gun positions. Compared 
to gun control advocates, gun 

rights 
advocates 
prioritize 
gun policies much more when 
they vote (which 
explains 
why 
majority 
support 
for 
gun 
control 
measures 
do 
not 
translate to federal-
level 
legislation). 
Though at odds with 
legal 
consensus 
and 
the 
needs 
of a safe society, 
uncompromising 
interpretations 
of 
the Second Amendment have 
nonetheless gained traction 
among diligent voters.
Second Amendment groups 
also advance the premise 
that the act of one should not 
lead to the rights of many 
being taken away. That this 
sophistry is often parroted 

by other pro-gun activists 
does not make it any less 
false. Restrictions of rights 
and privileges are always 
justified by the furthering of 
some public interest, even if 
those affected did nothing to 
warrant such a policy. I do not 
protest if I am subjected to an 
invasive search at the airport, 
even though I had nothing to 
do with the men responsible 
for 9/11. If smart gun control 
legislation 
actually 
helps 
reduce violence, the public 
safety 
of 
all 
citizens 
— 
gun owners included — is 
enhanced.
Another way these groups 
tend to distract from the real 
concern of formulating policy 
is by repetitively emphasizing 
largely 
irrelevant 
aspects 
of gun violence. The most 
prominent example is mental 
illness. Despite little to no 
supporting evidence, a high 
proportion 
of 
Republicans 
(and even a near-majority of 
Democrats) believe mental 
illness to be a key factor in 
gun 
violence. 
Attributing 
inadequate 
gun 
policy 
to 
health issues of individual 
perpetrators 
does 
little 
to 
address 
gun 
violence 
systematically, 
yet 
Second 
Amendment fundamentalists 
repeatedly do so.
None of this excuses liberals 
from their own myopia and 
folly when it comes to guns, 
however. Progressives who 
wish to tackle the problem 
of 
gun 
violence 
head-on 
have increasingly committed 
to over-enthusiasm at the 
expense 
of 
level-headed 
scrutiny.
For 
one, 
nearly 
all 
of 
the 
leading 
Democratic 
candidates for the pivotal 

2020 
presidential 
election 
have 
demonstrated 
their 
support of an assault weapons 
ban. It’s a policy that any 
good 
Second 
Amendment 
supporter 
knows 
to 
be 
extremely complicated in its 
effects in improving public 
safety, but well-proven at 
tanking electoral odds. Such 
a ban was previously signed 
into law by President Bill 
Clinton for 10 years starting 
in 1994. Later that year, 
Republicans 
rode 
a 
wave 
of 
popular 
dissatisfaction 
to take the U.S. House for 
the first time in decades. 
The 
subsequent 
era 
of 
conservative 
congressional 
dominance saw the Dickey 
amendment 
passed, 
which 
dealt 
a 
huge 
setback 
to 
gun control by effectively 
freezing federal funding on 
gun control policy. Liberals 
are 
sadly 
repeating 
the 
mistake of gambling away 
valuable political capital for 
ineffective policies.
What they should instead 
be focused on are universal 
background checks. Unlike 
an 
assault 
weapons 
ban, 
universal background checks 
enjoy 
majority 
support 
among American gun owners 
and would incur less political 
wrath. 
Most 
importantly, 
they would be but one step 
toward a more responsible 
distribution 
of 
guns 
in 
America. For even though 
no evidence suggests that 
universal background checks 
work on their own, they 
would make more proven 
gun control measures easier 
to pass into law — namely, 
permit-to-purchase laws.
Not only do such laws entail 
additional measures beyond 
background checks, they are 
also proven to significantly 
lower gun violence. Evidence 
is on the side of laws that 
regulate 
gun 
ownership, 
therefore 
encouraging 
responsibility. In a country 
awash with many more guns 
than qualified gun owners, 
laws like these are much-
needed.
Looking 
at 
the 
sheer 
number of gun homicides, 
gun suicides and accidental 
gun deaths in America, one 
can start to feel hopeless. 
But, 
somewhere 
between 
the Dickey amendments and 
assault weapons bans, hope 
appears. 
Those 
additional 
measures 
and 
permit-to-
purchase 
laws 
contribute 
to the responsible gun use 
I first encountered at my 
gun-safety class. And they 
are possible. What stands in 
the way are those who steer 
the conversation from policy 
to paranoia, and those who 
mistakenly 
lump 
together 
good gun control policies 
with bad ones. We just need 
to get better at tuning them 
out.

ETHAN KESSLER | COLUMN

I

’m consumed with an 
anger that I had been 
lucky to never have felt 
before this past summer.
I’m angry at my friend who 
went home, not questioning 
my slurred “I’m OK” as I 
stumbled
over and my other friend 
who disappeared with her 
boyfriend, 
never 
saying 
goodbye.
I’m 
angry 
that 
I 
kept 
drinking and that I can’t 
remember how I ended up in 
the basement with
him.
I’m angry that I didn’t say 
no.
I’m angry the reason I 
didn’t say no was because 
someone had not listened to 
my repeated no’s
the year before.
I’m 
angry 
that 
I 
felt 
like I couldn’t move, that 
I kept going in and out of 
consciousness.
I’m angry that he said 
“that was bad” when he was 
finished.
I’m angry that he dressed 
me, sat me up, then left me in 
the basement without turning 
back.
 I’m angry that no one 
was around or answered my 
calls when I finally made it 

upstairs.
I’m angry that he passed 
me sitting on the stairs to get 
food with a friend as I waited 
for a car.
I’m angry that I threw up 
six times that night.
I’m angry that I could 
barely sit the next day.
I’m angry that I felt numb 
for two weeks after and I now 
cry myself to sleep almost 
every night.
I’m angry that my friends 
don’t acknowledge what has 
happened to me, that they 
don’t check in
to see if I’m alright.
I’m angry that I feel like 
I’m being selfish, feeling that 
sharing my experience would 
be a burden on those who 
listen.
I’m angry that I’ve never 
felt more alone.
I’m angry that he invaded 
my thoughts every day this 
summer, even being across the 
globe.
I’m 
angry 
that 
I 
had 
to change where I would 
normally socialize at school 
and that I still see him
in areas of campus where I 
once felt safe.
I’m angry that I still can’t 
fully express my pain in 
words.

I’m angry that I have to 
distance myself from media 
surrounding sexual assault 
and that my
volunteer 
position 
in 
SAPAC is now too much to 
handle most of the time.
I’m angry that I have to 
accept this as a part of my 
past.
I’m angry that only time 
can heal this wound.
I’m happy that I love and 
feel in control of my body once 
again.
I’m happy that this anger is 
no longer constant and that I 
can handle it better when it 
reappears.
I’m 
happy 
that 
I 
have 
proved to myself that I am 
stronger than I ever thought I 
would have to be.
I’m happy that I have come 
to terms with this being a part 
of who I am.
And most of all, I am proud 
that I do not let it define me.

Olivia Karas is having fun again

In 
observance 
of 
Women’s 
History Month, The Daily’s sports 
section is launching its second 
annual series aimed at telling the 
stories of female athletes, coaches 
and teams at the University from 
the perspective of the female sports 
writers on staff. Daily Sports Editor 
Anna Marcus continues the series 
with this story.
With a hand on her hip and the 
other pointed towards the sky, 
Olivia Karas beamed.
It was the last routine of the 
annual Flip for Chip meet on Feb. 
3, and the senior gymnast had just 
nailed a double pike in her floor 
performance to give Michigan an 
edge over Nebraska.
She struck that final pose, a 
staple of her floor routine, as the 
music shut off. The sounds of 
Madonna, Frank Sinatra and a 
touch of “High School Musical” 
were 
replaced 
by 
standing 
ovations in Crisler Center and a 
screaming women’s gymnastics 
team.
While Karas was consumed 
by the embrace of her teammates 
at mat’s center, the board flashed 
9.950 for her outing. One judge 
awarded her a perfect 10.
Karas 
had 
performed 
numerous 
variations 
of 
the 
routine in practices and meets 
before and has executed many 
updated versions of it since that 
day.
But that meet in early February 
sticks out to Michigan coach Bev 
Plocki. Olivia Karas was back, and 
she was having a ball. 
***
Putting on a show when 
competing is a talent that comes 
naturally to Karas, one that she 
already had a knack for when she 
began her Michigan gymnastics 
career four years ago.
The 
outgoing 
and 
bubbly 
gymnast did not shy away from 
the spotlight her freshman season, 
and quickly became defined by 
her dramatic performances that 
captivated crowds.
“She tells us all the time, ‘I 
come from a family of actors.’ ” 
Plocki said. “So her parents both 
did some acting, I think her mom 
even more so than her dad.”
Along 
with 
theatricality 
running in the family, Karas’ club 
coach emphasized the importance 
of choreography before she came 
to Michigan. At her club gym, 
the Chicago native spent time 
focusing on presentation along 
with technicality, learning early 
on to keep her eyes up off of the 
floor and the beam.
Equipped with these skills, 
Karas not only dazzled audiences 
in her debut season, but judges 
were paying attention, too.
As Plocki recalls:
“She was kind of an instant 
sensation.”
Karas took the Big Ten by 
storm in that first year, bringing 
in recognition after recognition. 
She shocked the conference as a 
nine-time Big Ten Freshman of 
the Week and a three-time Big 
Ten Gymnast of the Week. She 
was named to the All-Big Ten 
first team and claimed Big Ten 
Freshman of the Year honors. She 
finished the season ranked as the 
No. 2 vaulter in the nation and No. 
7 on the floor exercise. The list 
could go on.
In addition to all of Karas’ 
individual accomplishments, the 
women’s gymnastics team was, 
as usual, having a banner year. 
Michigan won the 2016 Big Ten 
Championship in Lincoln, Neb., 
and sent three gymnasts to the 
NCAA Championships.

For 
wide-eyed 
Karas 
and 
her classmate Emma McLean, 
competing in their first Big Ten 
Championship 
proved 
to 
be 
an experience that exceeded 
expectations.
“My freshman year, everyone 
always told Emma and I that 
winning Big Tens was the best 
feeling ever,” Karas recalled. “And 
you watch it and you’re like ‘Yeah 
it looks pretty cool’ — obviously 
you’re winning your conference — 
but you don’t really get it until you 
experience it.
“It was just one of those 
moments that I’ll never forget.”
The 2017 season brought more 
success for Karas, who performed 
her way to a career-high vault 
score of 9.975 and once again 
earned herself a spot on the All-
Big Ten first team list. Michigan 
collected 
another 
Big 
Ten 
Championship and was crowned 
the winner of its NCAA Regional.
Beginning 
conference 
competition in 2018 with an 
electric floor performance against 
Ohio State, earning a top-scoring 
9.950, Karas’ junior season was on 
track to follow a similar trajectory 
to her first two.
But then it didn’t. During the 
fifth meet of the year against 
Maryland, in the middle of her 
floor routine, Karas tore her 
Achilles tendon. Karas’ junior 
season abruptly ended while 
performing in one of her favorite 
rotations.
***
If it weren’t for the wheelchair 
and boot, it would have been hard 
to tell that Karas was injured at all. 
Though sidelined, she maintained 
a larger than life presence at 
meets, cheering and screaming 
louder than any other gymnast 
and radiating positivity as her 
teammates competed.
Plocki remembers having to 
“calm down” Karas, who was 
sometimes jumping and cheering 
while wearing her boot.
“(Karas) didn’t reserve any of 
that energy for herself,” Plocki 
said. “She gave every single bit of 
what she had to the team.”
Despite the constant smile 
present on Karas’ face, coming to 
terms with her injury did not come 
as easily as it may have appeared.
“I definitely had moments 
where I think I tried so hard to be 
a positive force for my teammates 
and sometimes didn’t let myself 
feel pain and sadness,” Karas 
said. “But there were some days 
where Emma — she knows me 
so well — she would be like, ‘You 
need to let yourself feel’ because 
I would try to mask the fact that I 
had torn my Achilles with this like 
‘Everything’s fine, don’t dwell on 
it’ attitude, but everything wasn’t 
fine.
“And once I came to terms with 
the fact that I did get hurt and 
I’m allowed to be upset, I think I 
became more authentic in how I 
cheered for my teammates.”
For Karas, it took a little over a 
month to deal mentally with the 
pain in a productive way and to 
let herself lean on others for help. 
She found that this better attitude 
came along once she had increased 
physical mobility. Throughout the 
entire healing process, though, her 
team provided her with consistent 
love and support.
Sometimes, small acts and a 
little extra effort meant the most. 
Be it from cooking dinners, to 
giving her pep talks, to carrying 
her from the car, the entire team 
chipped in to function as a support 
system for Karas during the injury.
“It’s impossible to not lean on 
them as family members,” Karas 
said. “I don’t think they know how 
much they helped me. There were 

days that I really did not want to 
be here at all, because I was like, 
‘If I can’t do a floor routine, if I 
can’t compete, like what am I even 
doing,’ and they reminded me that 
there are so many more things 
than gymnastics in life.”
McLean, as a roommate and 
best friend, particularly took 
on these duties, providing care 
for Karas. And it wasn’t always 
glamorous. 
Karas 
explained 
that McLean helped her with 
showering and carried her places 
regularly, all while McLean was 
still practicing and competing.
For McLean, though, being 
there to help was second nature. 
The two have had a strong bond 
since freshman year, and when 
McLean had a neck injury during 
her first season, Karas was always 
there to lend a hand.
“We do talk about how we’ve 
helped each other through our 
hard times,” McLean said. “I think 
just being there for each other at 
the end of each day, and helping 
each other smile no matter what.
“And the injury, it’s how you 
respond to it, not necessarily the 
injury itself.”
***
It’s safe to say Karas got her 
comeback campaign.
She recently received two 
regular 
season 
All-American 
honors for her senior year and she 
tied with freshman Natalie Wojcik 
for the top all-around score at 
the Big Ten Championship last 
weekend. Karas has been named 
one of six finalists for the AAI 
Award — an award given to the 
nation’s top senior gymnast.
At first, it wasn’t easy to picture 
herself in the place she is now.
“I definitely got to the point 
where I would try to do something 
and get so mad that I couldn’t do 
it, but I had to remind myself that 
I hadn’t done it for seven months, 
so obviously it’s going to be hard,” 
Karas said.
Slowly, Karas was able to 
build herself back up to the role 
of an elite competitor on the 
floor exercise. She had to teach 
herself how to enjoy the floor 
again, overcoming the serious 
mental barrier that came while 
performing the event that had led 
to her injury.
She, too, will never forget how 
she felt after her clean double 
pike at the end of February’s meet 
against Nebraska, viewing it as a 
highlight of her career. And Karas 
takes pride in how far she has 
come.
“Getting hurt my junior year 
and getting kind of a victory lap 
(this season) is more than I could 
ask for,” Karas said.
In 
Karas’ 
opinion, 
her 
comeback isn’t fully complete 
yet. Michigan awaits its NCAA 
Regional, and Karas has more 
routines left to ace as a Wolverine. 
“I like to say that I’m 98 percent 
back,” she said, “and that the 100 
will get there when it needs to.” 
One thing Karas will admit, 
though, is that in her senior 
season, she feels the most herself. 
She has found music combinations 
that are authentic and the most 
“her” and has a stronger mentality, 
allowing her true self to shine in 
competition more than it ever has 
before.
“I came in here really wanting 
to be perfect in everything, and 
in these four years, both in life 
and gymnastics, I’ve realized that 
mistakes are part of the process, 
and the only way to get through it 
is to laugh it off and to just get over 
it,” Karas said.
Finally allowing herself to 
embrace those mistakes, Karas is 
having the most fun.

After collapse at end of season, 
Brown ready to retool defense

Don Brown is passionate, of 
course, but he isn’t known to 
mince 
words. 
The 
defensive 
coordinator’s feelings on how 
last season ended for Michigan 
football — 103 points allowed 
in the final two games — are an 
obvious example.
“The 
most 
disappointing 
experience I’ve ever been through 
in my entire life,” the 63-year-old 
said Wednesday evening. “The 
whole thing.”
Hyperbole or not, the epic 
defensive breakdown marred an 
otherwise remarkable year for the 
Wolverines’ defense, which still 
finished second in the country in 
total defense.
But when faced with dealing 
with 
an 
inscrutable, 
season-
ending collapse, Brown said he 
made “a tremendous mistake.” 
He hopped on a plane for the 
recruiting trail the day after the 
Peach Bowl loss before circling 
back with his current unit, leaving 
almost three weeks to let his 
defense’s shortcomings marinate.
“I come back and I’m like 
‘Holy shit! We’ve still got a little 
hangover.’ ” Brown said. “... It just 
leaves doubt in your mind as a 
coach — ’Did I do everything that 
I could to prepare my guys?’ That’s 
all. I take that stuff personally.
“Sometimes you’ve gotta do 
a bit of a better job. Trust me, it’s 
being addressed. Our guys are 
totally into it. I’m just excited for 

the chance to redeem myself.”
Getting that redemption is 
undoubtedly an uphill battle. 
That climb is exacerbated with 
the departures of soon-to-be 
NFL Draft picks Rashan Gary, 
Devin Bush, David Long and 
Chase Winovich, as well as the 
lost veteran presences of Tyree 
Kinnel, Bryan Mone and Brandon 
Watson.
Though par for the course for 
spring football chatter, Brown 
and his players have shown little 
concern about replicating last 
year’s 
accomplishments 
and 
righting the wrongs. Brown listed 
the names of improved players 
through five spring practices and 
claimed that the defense can go 16 
or 17 guys deep right now.
“It’s college football,” said 
junior safety Josh Metellus. “It’s 
always next man up no matter 
what happens. Losing big guys like 
Devin Bush, Rashan Gary, Chase 
Winovich, David Long, that’s the 
game of football. We have Coach 
Harbaugh, who does a great job 
recruiting, bringing in guys to step 
up, getting ready for a role.”
A number of younger players 
have generated buzz early on to 
fill the void, including sophomore 
defensive back Ambry Thomas, 
sophomore linebacker Josh Ross, 
incoming 
freshman 
defensive 
tackle Mazi Smith and redshirt 
freshman Luiji Vilain, who has 
missed the past two seasons with 
knee injuries.
With Bush and Kinnel gone, 
the defense will also need two 

new captains — a role that could 
be filled by Metellus and junior 
defensive back Lavert Hill. But 
with fewer household names on 
the defense, leadership will come 
from more subtle places.
“There’s a lot of young guys 
on the team, younger than the 
D-line actually,” said sophomore 
defensive end Kwity Paye on how 
to fill Gary and Winovich’s roles. 
“I have to be the guy to pull the 
guys aside who’s messing up in 
practice and say ‘Let’s work on this 
today, let’s work on that today.’ ”
Despite working in Brown’s 
system 
for 
another 
year, 
the 
defense 
is 
also 
making 
adjustments in practice against 
a new-look offense. With newly-
hired offensive coordinator Josh 
Gattis implementing a pro-spread 
offense, the defense is now facing 
an up-tempo, no-huddle style that 
it isn’t accustomed to seeing.
In 
practice, 
the 
Michigan 
defense would operate on a 16 to 
18-second timer to get into new 
formations, but has never faced 
the threat head-to-head.
While the schematic alterations 
are minor and the team has 
displayed confidence in potential 
new starters, a change beyond 
fundamentals is where focus lies 
in hopes to reverse course for the 
2019 season. For them, it’s a matter 
of confidence.
“Everybody has a part to 
play, everybody does their role,” 
Metellus said. “… We don’t need a 
star, we just need to play how our 
defense plays.”

With the end looming, Charles Matthews is running it back

ANAHEIM, Calif. — Given 
that this could be the last 
practice of Charles Matthews’ 
college career, 
he 
carries 
a 
remarkable air 
of normalcy.
The redshirt 
junior gets on 
the floor and 
stretches 
his 
legs 
out, 
the 
foam 
roller 
vibrating 
just 
as always. He’s 
sitting 
next 
to Zavier Simpson and Isaiah 
Livers and then he’s shooting 
around with them before John 
Beilein starts a passing drill. The 
ball moves, but it doesn’t quite 
hum. Matthews darts towards 
the basket with his hands up, 
knowing the drill calls for the 
ball to go elsewhere. His facial 
expression is mostly the same 
serious look he’s carried with 
him for the last two seasons. 
He’s done this before. Shoes 
squeak. Just as always.
It is an open secret that 
Matthews will go to the NBA 
— most of his teammates and 
coaches 
have 
ditched 
the 
formality of pretending — so 
technically 
speaking, 
every 
practice 
last 
week 
in 
Des 
Moines, Iowa, could have been 
his last. But this is the first 
where it really, truly feels that 
tomorrow, 
Michigan 
could 
lose to a team that just might 
be better. The Wolverines are 
favored by all of two points, 
a margin small enough that 
few will write about what this 
season could have been if it 
ends with a Sweet Sixteen loss 
to Texas Tech, the only defense 
ranking ahead of the Wolverines 
in KenPom.
But Charles Matthews will 
wonder.
Matthews will guard Red 

Raiders wing Jarrett Culver on 
Thursday, a matchup on which 
the game’s result could hinge. 
A likely top-10 pick against 
someone whose chance at an 
NBA career will come down to 
guarding 
top-10 
picks.
“He can score 
on 
all 
three 
levels,” assistant 
coach 
Luke 
Yaklich 
said 
of 
Culver. “And then 
he 
passes 
the 
ball. He can get 
you an offensive 
rebound. He can 
score in the post. 
He can get you off a ball-screen 
with his pull-up jumper, getting 
to the rim. He can beat you off 
the ball-screen by passing it out 
to open shooters. Then he can 

beat you off the ball-screen by 
getting it to the rim, to the bigs.”
In short, he does damn near 
everything.
In 
preparing, 
Matthews 
is even-keeled. “There’s not 
a lot of peaks 
and 
valleys 
with 
Charles,” 
Yaklich 
said. 
“He’s a mentally 
tough 
kid.” 
Where 
others 
watch film then 
rewind, 
then 
rewind 
again, 
then still don’t 
get it, Matthews 
sees things once 
and digests.
In the run-up to a late-
November game against North 
Carolina 
this 
season, 
the 
coaches were walking through 

some of the Tar Heels’ concepts. 
They 
hadn’t 
brought 
up 
a 
certain baseline cross-screen 
yet — one of the base actions 
in Roy Williams’ offense. So 
Matthews did.
When 
North 
Carolina ran it in 
the game?
“Charles was 
right on top of 
it,” remembered 
walk-on forward 
C.J. Baird.
Two 
seasons 
ago, 
Matthews 
arrived in Ann 
Arbor 
from 
a 
Kentucky 
program which has an ethos 
that juxtaposes Michigan’s in 
every conceivable way. Now, he 
is one of the culture-setters for 
John Beilein.

“I feel like it’s just all 
experience, and he has a lot of 
experience, coming from a really 
top-tier (program) that he came 
from, coming to another top-
tier,” Isaiah Livers, a sophomore 
forward, 
said. “It’s just 
bringing 
all 
the 
knowledge 
you learn (into 
watching film).”
Just 
before, 
Livers had been 
asked 
about 
Matthews 
as 
a 
“leader 
by 
example,” which 
is usually code 
for, “a senior who doesn’t talk 
very much.” This time of year, 
you hear a lot about leaders by 
example, and the label has stuck 
to Matthews. The difference 

is, Matthews picks his spots to 
talk — halftime against Florida, 
in the aftermath of a disastrous 
loss at Penn State — and does so 
with maximal impact.
“I don’t think he was ever 
one 
of 
those 
shy 
guys,” 
said 
assistant 
coach 
Saddi 
Washington. 
“I 
think 
that 
he 
was always very 
confident 
in 
himself and his 
abilities. And so 
when you got a 
kid like that who 
has that kind of 
confidence about himself, it’s an 
easy transition for him.”
One of the core tenants of the 
culture Matthews has helped 
build is to settle for nothing less 
than championship-level play.
After that game against North 
Carolina, where the Wolverines 
smacked 
the 
Tar 
Heels 
— 
holding them 30 points below 
their average and winning by 
17 — he rejected a reporter’s 
assumption 
that 
Michigan 
played 
good 
defense. 
After 
hitting a buzzer-beater against 
Minnesota 
in 
January, 
he 
expressed only disappointment 
that the Wolverines didn’t run 
the Gophers out of the gym. 
After that loss at Penn State, he 
was sullen and angry and letting 
everybody know it.
“Charles approaches every 
game the same way,” Yaklich 
said. “It’s a steady, methodical 
approach in how he prepares 
in practice, then his pregame 
routine to how he goes through 
things in pregame warmups to 
his coaching in media timeouts. 
It’s what makes Charles really, 
really good.”
So against the Red Raiders, 
it’s no surprise that Matthews 
takes the same approach, holds 
the same expectation. It’s just 
as always, even if it’s for the last 
time.

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily
Redshirt junior Charles Matthews will face Texas Tech wing Jarrett Culver on Thursday, a matchup which could very well dictate the outcome of the game.

In short, 
(Culver) does 
damn near 
everything.

There’s not a 
lot of peaks and 
valleys with 
Charles.

I feel like 
it’s just all 
experience, and 
he has a lot...

For Brazdeikis, this is not your typical freshman

ANAHEIM, Calif. — As the 
cameras 
swarmed 
to 
Ignas 
Brazdeikis, he only sank further 
into his element.
A slew of local TV cameras 
shone in his face, there was a 
reporter from Sports Illustrated 
asking 
him 
questions 
and 
many more waiting for their 
turn. Brazdeikis, mind you, is 
a freshman, playing in his first 
NCAA Tournament.
On the other side of the Honda 
Center, Texas Tech’s Malik 
Ondigo spent the afternoon 
talking about preparing the 
Red Raiders’ freshmen for their 
first taste of the tournament’s 
second weekend. This, after 
all, is a level of intensity that 
they’ve never experienced.
As that same pressure is 
heaped on Brazdeikis, he’s the 
same player he’s always been. 
With each question, he only 
leaned further back into his 
chair, stretching his legs out 
into the scrum of reporters and 
running his fingers through his 
hair.
When one reporter asked 
about 
Michigan’s 
defensive 
identity, he yawned in blatant 
disregard 
of 
the 
moment’s 
importance.

As soon as his yawn ended, 
the confidence returned.
“I think (assistant coach Luke 
Yaklich) is definitely one of the 
best,” he told the reporter before 
pausing. “No, he’s definitely the 
best defensive coach I’ve ever 
had.”
It’s the same confidence that 
endeared himself to Michigan 
fans back in November, when he 
responded to a sleepy, 56-37 win 
over Holy Cross 
by 
describing 
himself as the 
best free throw 
shooter in the 
world. It’s the 
same confidence 
that 
led 
him 
to respond to 
two 
hours 
of 
personal insults 
at 
Maryland 
with a flurry of 
flexes, before telling reporters, 
“I love that part of the game, 
that’s one of my favorite parts of 
the game by far.”
And 
now, 
it’s 
the 
same 
confidence 
that 
has 
him 
ready for this moment — no 
mentoring necessary. Because 
it isn’t manufactured. It’s who 
Brazdeikis is, and who he’s 
always been.
Nate Johnson, Brazdeikis’ 
high school coach at Orangeville 

Prep, confirmed his effervescent 
confidence is rooted in his 
perceived version of reality. In 
Brazdeikis’ mind, Johnson said, 
Michigan is the best team in 
the country and he is one of the 
nation’s best players.
After practices in high school, 
he would ask Johnson what 
levels pro players had scored on 
the drills that Orangeville ran. 
If the number was higher than 
his own scores, 
Brazdeikis 
would stay after 
practice until he 
deemed his own 
performances 
satisfactory.
Wednesday 
afternoon 
in 
Anaheim, 
assistant 
coach 
Saddi 
Washington 
began to give a stock answer on 
the importance of not changing 
who you are this time of year 
and embracing the moment. 
Then, 
midway 
through 
his 
answer, a light bulb went off, as 
if he suddenly remembered who 
he was talking about.
“But guys like Iggy and —,” 
Washington said, pausing, and 
failing, to rack his brain for 
anyone else comparable. “All 
of our guys, I think they really 

thrive in these moments.”
Amidst requisite praise for 
the Wolverines’ leaders, Haynes 
sang the same tune.
“Iggy lives up for these 
moments,” 
Haynes 
said. 
“I 
haven’t seen a kid like him that 
lives for these moments. He 
loves the crowd, he feeds into it, 
whether it’s hate or love. He’s a 
different kind of guy.”
But no matter how Brazdeikis’ 
approach has prepared him 
for this moment, there is no 
high school version of March 
Madness — certainly not in 
Canada. This is the reality that 
hit Nik Stauskas, Michigan’s 
Canadian guard from 2012-14 
who Brazdeikis works out with 
over the summer, when the 
Wolverines made the national 
championship in his freshman 
season. Stauskas finished with 
zero and three points in his 
two Final Four games that year 
after averaging 11.0 during the 
regular season.
“It’s definitely gonna be a 
new thing for him,” Stauskas 
told The Daily earlier this 
month. “March Madness is very 
unique, I don’t think there’s 
many things like this.”
Stauskas, 
though, 
knew 
Brazdeikis would be ready.
“I think (what stands out is) 
just how normal everything 
feels for him,” Stauskas said. 
“With all the success he’s 
having, it doesn’t feel like this 
is some kind of fluke for him. 
He truly believes this is just 
normal, this is what he should 
be doing.”
Jordan Poole is one of the few 
who knows the March spotlight 
better than Stauskas. This time 
last year, he was the freshman 
thrust under its wrath after his 
buzzer-beater sent Michigan 
into the Sweet Sixteen.
But when asked whether he’s 
given Brazdeikis any advice, 
Poole cocked his head back and 
cracked a smile.
“I ain’t given him any advice,” 
Poole said.
Because Poole, better than 
anybody, 
knows 
Brazdeikis 
doesn’t need it.
“It’s just some people that’s 
just built for it.”

In ‘M’ and Texas Tech, 
top two defenses clash

ANAHEIM, Calif. — Growing 
up, Isaiah Livers changed the 
channel every time there was a 
hard-nosed defensive battle. After 
all, who wanted to watch a lot of 
people not scoring?
But 
now, 
the 
sophomore 
forward knows that on Thursday, 
he will likely face one of those 
games when the Michigan men’s 
basketball team faces Texas Tech 
in the Sweet Sixteen. This will be 
the top two defensive teams in the 
country going at it, and Livers is as 
excited as anyone to be a part of it.
“Now I want to see what the 
score is gonna be,” Livers said. 
“If we can hold them under their 
season average and they can hold 
us under our season average.”
Livers changed his mindset on 
defense primarily due to assistant 
coach Luke Yaklich, who urged 
Livers to think about why he liked 
defense. Livers replied that he 
didn’t like people scoring because 
that’s how you lose games. Yaklich 
pressed other members of the 
team in much the same way, giving 
way to a culture change in the 
Wolverines’ program — one that 
loves defense.
In that sense, the Red Raiders 
are a spitting image. Texas Tech 
hired coach Chris Beard from 
Little Rock in 2016, and Beard 
brought with him Mark Adams, 
his defensive right-hand man. 
Beard and Adams created much 
the same culture that Yaklich did, 
transforming the Red Raiders 
from a Big 12 afterthought to a 
national contender with a clear 
identity.
But Texas Tech’s defensive 
strategy 
couldn’t 
be 
more 
different from Michigan’s. While 
the Wolverines run opposing 
players off the 3-point line, defend 
one-on-one and rarely foul, the 
Red Raiders play a “no middle” 
pressure defense that forces teams 
into baseline drives and tries for 
turnovers. Each has shined with its 
own scheme. Now, it’ll be strength 
vs. strength, identity vs. identity.

“There’s a hundred ways to do 
it right in basketball,” Yaklich said. 
“You can pick a hundred plays 
to run and it all revolves around 
how much you’re paying attention 
to that on a daily basis. … Coach 
Beard and his staff, like us on the 
defensive side of the ball, there’s 
certain things that we’re gonna pay 
attention to and stat and reward 
and really lock into.”
At Wednesday’s practice, the 
Wolverines prepared to run a 
drill. Michigan coach John Beilein 
yelled out, “Perfect passing! Let’s 
go!”
That’s how Michigan prepares 
for a stalwart defensive battle 
— by focusing on its offensive 
fundamentals. 
Perfect 
passing 
goes back to the very first practice. 
Go into the defender’s body. Put 
your outside hand all the way 
out so the passer can throw the 
ball easily. It’s something that 
constantly evolves, but in a game 
like this, it’ll matter more than 
ever. So with their limited practice 
time, the Wolverines have circled 
back to it.
Staying disciplined. Holding 
onto the ball. Perfect passing. It’s 
the same strategy Michigan used 
against other pressure teams 
like Illinois and Northwestern. 
Texas Tech’s defense is a big step 
up from those two, but then, the 
Wolverines have had more time to 
perfect a strategy.
“We just study them,” said 
assistant coach DeAndre Haynes. 
“Say, ‘Hey, we’re gonna try to score 
against them, you see this? Let’s do 
this.’ ”
These kinds of games are often 
overlooked by the casual college 
basketball fan, eschewed in favor 
of a more glamorous matchup 
with a symphony of shots. But for 
Michigan and Texas Tech, the 
two most unique teams left in the 
tournament, both testaments to 
a specific type of culture change, 
perhaps the matchup couldn’t be 
more perfect.
“We hang our hat on defense, 
they hang their hat on defense,” 
Haynes said. “And that’s gonna be 
two dogfights out there.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Poppy’s YouTube videos feel 

like “Twin Peaks”’s famous Red 
Room scenes. Her contrived 
speech, 
often 
dubbed 
over 

surreal electronic soundscapes, 
serves to critique cliché, fake 
and overstated online social 
interactions. Though some give 
her less credit than this, her rise to 
fame nonetheless demonstrates 
how much we continue to 
encourage 
artificiality 
and 

naiveté in women.

Poppy’s childish and wide-

eyed appearance and behavior is 
a large part of her initial appeal. 
Listening to her mesmerizingly 
high-pitched, monotone voice 
forces you to stay. And to click on 
the next video. And the next. She 
constantly holds over our head 
the promise of finding out where 
she came from and who she is 
while never revealing more.

And you can’t “find” her 

identity with a quick Google 
search either. She was born 
Moriah Rose Pereira in Boston, 
and moved to Nashville as a child 
before moving to LA to start her 
career. When asked where she’s 
from, she simply replies, “I came 
from the internet.”

Many of her videos are nothing 

more than her listing things. In 
one she lists historical figures. In 
another she lists things she likes. 
In another she lists some phrases 
she’s found on the internet:

“Young girl makes crazy video 

on Youtube, what happens next 

you won’t believe your eyes!”

“Thank you so much for all of 

your support.”

“I wish I could explain to you 

how happy I am.”

And, when she’s not robotically 

regurgitating information she’s 
found online, she’ll make an 
off-kilter comment that makes 
us wonder if there’s something 
more to her (or if she’s okay?):

“If it’s on the internet it’s 

~reaaal~. Do you believe in the 
internet?”

“Am I a girl?”
“This planet makes sense to 

me.”

So where does she come from? 

Where is she coming from with 
these videos? The only hint 
we’re ever given is a plug for 
her creative director, Titanic 
Sinclair. Sinclair has videos of 
himself doing much the same 
thing as Poppy on his YouTube 
channel, but his videos only 
garner a fraction of Poppy’s 
video’s views.

This 
suggests 
Poppy’s 

appearance is a pivotal part of 
her persona. Why her? Well, 
her petite, doll-like qualities 
and unassuming expression all 
play into disturbingly idealized 
notions of the female figure — all 
notions that have come to be fully 
integrated into our construction 
of actual robots.

Gendering robots has existed 

long before we could make any 
functional beings of the sort (“I’ll 
be your freak-a-zoid, come on 
and wind me up”) — but now we 

can. In recent years in Japan, all 
sorts of efforts have been made 
in integrating robots into society. 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has 
backed all sorts of efforts to have 
humanoids 
become 
integral 

parts of society, from automated 
housewives to policemen.

While there are perks to 

making robots our pals, much 
of the gendering that’s already 
happening is highly problematic. 
It directly follows Japanese 
anime’s fetishization of youth 
and large-breasted, slim waisted 
women. It also reinforces gender 
roles not just in the workplace, 
but also in the very way we 
expect people to talk and behave 
according to their respective 
gender.

Considering 
these 
things, 

Poppy seems to be asking us, 
“Am I the girl you want?” Her 
speech is reminiscent both of the 
uninspiring Instagram captions 
of today and of the idealized 
voices of the humanoids of 
tomorrow. 
It’s 
disappointing 

but not surprising that this 
artificiality doesn’t hold up for 
Titanic Sinclair. Do you really 
think the it-girls of Instagram 
got famous off their wit?

At this rate, we’ll one day have 

automated Barbie dolls sweeping 
our floors. Whether you believe 
Poppy is actually critiquing these 
ideals or basking in her newfound 
popularity (which she always 
knew she could have cause she’s 
pretty!), she certainly makes us 
think about what we value in 
identity, and, more importantly, 
just how much of this needs to be 
carried over to our future robots.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW: ‘WHO DO 

YOU LOVE’

The Chainsmokers’s new 

video for their single “Who 
Do 
You 
Love” 
featuring 

5 
Seconds 
of 
Summer 

presents a Battle of the 
Bands competition between 
the two groups as they 
belt out the song while 
trying to outperform each 
other. Each band takes 
turns wowing the crowd, 
with wild tricks such as 
flaming instruments and 
crowd surfing to draw 
their attention.

The two bands released 

the song back in Feb. and 
have surprised audiences 
with their unpredictable 
collaboration. The single’s 
musical 
style 
seems 
to 

incorporate a good balance of 
the sound fans have come to 
love from both groups. With 
a catchy chorus and simple 
acoustic 
riffs, 
there’s 
no 

doubt this tune was intended 
to be a heartbreak anthem 
for their young audience.

Although the video doesn’t 

focus on the song’s lyrics 
about dying relationships, 

it does give us a taste of 
the youthful wildness and 
passion many artists try to 
hone in on. Set in a garage 
with a crowd dancing and 
singing along, you can feel the 
video’s subjects’ excitement 

in being young and declaring 
that through music. The 
Chainsmokers and 5 Seconds 
of Summer have given us yet 
another heartache singalong 
young people will be dancing 
to for the next few months.
While the moves the bands 
shows off are a little cheesy, 
the 
absurdity 
of 
their 

performances gives off the 
humorous notion that maybe 
we shouldn’t take things 
so seriously. Watching the 
two groups be so carefree 
and goofy makes you want 
to grab a bunch of friends, 
turn the music up and sing 
away the sorrows of young 
heartbreak.

B-SIDE: NEW MEDIA

“The Hills” is coming back this 

year. MTV is reviving its classic 
reality show about the lives of Los 
Angeles’s nouveau riche and calling 
it “The Hills: New Beginnings.” 
Most of the original cast is returning, 
except for the few who managed 
to find upstanding, respectable 
jobs cultivating lifestyle brands 
and Instagramming pinkish-beige 
things with gold accents. In their 
place, MTV is tossing in some new 
faces — Mischa Barton (hmm) and 
Pamela Anderson’s son (HMMM) 
— in the hopes that they’re pretty 
and blonde enough that we’ll forget 
they weren’t there the first time 
around.

It’s just as well, because those 

four years of “The Hills” were a 
bit of a blur anyway. If there was 
anything to be learned from the 
show, it was just how boring your 
life was in comparison to the ones 
these women lived. They worked 
in impossibly chic offices, got bottle 
service at the swankiest clubs and 
they all had gorgeous, terrible 
boyfriends. They walked away 
from lifelong friendships for their 
gorgeous, terrible boyfriends. They 
ruined precious $30 Guerlain Cils 
D’Enfer mascara crying over their 
gorgeous, terrible boyfriends. They 
turned down once-in-a-lifetime 
summer jobs at French Vogue 
to spend more time with their 
gorgeous, terrible boyfriends. God, 
they were so young and dumb and 
strange, but hey, it worked.

Then one day, when it seemed 

like everyone on the show was one 
or two vodka tonics at S Bar from 
committing a violent crime, “The 

Hills” ended. Kristin Cavallari, the 
show’s villain-turned-protagonist, 
decided she was going to move to 
Europe (no country in particular, 
just Europe) and everybody said 
their clumsy, prickly onscreen 
goodbyes. In the final scene, Kristin 
heads out to meet her ride to the 
airport. Who is waiting for her 
but her star-crossed flame Brody 
Jenner (yes, he is gorgeous and yes, 
he is also terrible). They stare at 
each other longingly, banter about 
what might have been, and Kristin 
slips into a town car and speeds 
away.

Cue a clip montage of all the 

good times they have had together, 
set to a stripped-down version of 
Natasha Bedingfield’s “Unwritten.” 
Cut back to a teary-eyed Brody, 
watching Kristin’s car disappear 
into the distance. It has the makings 
of a perfectly anodyne television 
finale until something strange 
happens. The trees and Hollywood 
sign behind Brody move, and the 
camera pulls back to reveal that the 
scene took place on a soundstage. It 
had all been fake!

In that moment, “Unwritten” felt 

almost taunting. Here was this song 
about the unpredictable nature of 
life, about the winding, inchoate 
paths we take. And all the while, 
“The Hills” was, as a matter of fact, 
totally and completely written. 
For six seasons we had laughed 
about how contrived the show’s 
squabbles were, how unlikely 
their 
professional 
successes 

were and how vapid everybody 
seemed. And the whole time, “The 
Hills” had been in on the joke. (Or 
more distressingly, the joke had 
been on us.) A doting, enthralled 
audience was — as Ja Rule put it — 
hustled, scammed, bamboozled, 

hoodwinked and led astray.

The illusion continued to shatter. 

At first, the producers suggested 
that the ending was an open-
ended question of sorts, meant to 
provoke thought about what was 
real and what was fake. In the years 
since, though, the cast has mostly 
stopped 
pretending 
anything 

was real. Kristin and Audrina 
Patridge revealed that a big fight 
between them had never happened. 
Whitney Port said she didn’t 
actually take that Paris internship 
Lauren had turned down. Spencer 
Pratt and Heidi Montag admitted 
that the reason their neighbor’s 
son was always over at their house 
was because it was his house — 
his family’s house was easier to 
film in than the couple’s home in 
the Palisades (so yes, the birthday 
party they threw for little Enzo 
was all the conjuring of some bored 
producer).

I have devoted maybe a third 

of my waking moments (and 
quite possibly a sizeable portion 
of my sleeping moments) to 
contemplating this scene. Was 
it mean? Ridiculous? A cop out? 
Quietly brilliant? Loudly stupid? 
The answer, I think, is yes. Nobody 
watched “The Hills” for vérité. It’s 
an unspoken truth that reality TV 
is more or less a misnomer, but part 
of the thrill of reality television is 
knowing that someone is taking it 
seriously because they have stakes 
in the illusion. That’s what makes 
MTV’s choice baffling — and 
admirable. It was tantamount to 
admitting that they didn’t really 
care about any of it. And they 
especially didn’t care about us. 
“Yeah, we’re fake,” the finale said. 
“What’s it to you?” It doesn’t get 
more real than that.

When ‘The Hills’ admitted 
it was smoke and mirrors

B-SIDE: TV

Imagine you’re standing in a 

room with your friends. One of you 
makes an offhand comment, maybe 
a quick joke. Suddenly, you hear 
echoes of laughter. It’s not yours, 
it’s not your friends’. It doesn’t 
stop. It gets louder, it continues, it 
happens again. Slowly it drives you 
into madness, until all you can hear 
is the shadows of ghostly laughter 
ringing in your ears. This may 
sound like a nightmare, and to many 
(myself included), it is. But this isn’t 
the topic of the next Jordan Peele 
hit or a Hitchcock classic. No, this 
is the horrible reality of so many 
sitcoms and so-called comedies, a 
vehicle of pure torture: The laugh 
track.

The laugh track was first used in 

the “Hank McCune Show” in 1950, 
and it has plagued the TV-watching 
public ever since. First developed 
by CBS sound engineer Charley 
Douglass to “sweeten” audience 
laughter, the laugh track was 
initially used as a way to amplify 
natural audience laughter and 
polish it for a more unified 
sound. Now, the faux chortles are 
generally called upon to make 
drab, overhyped shows that employ 
misogynist tropes and unoriginal 
storylines appear funny. And yes, 
I am talking to you “The Big Bang 
Theory.”

Laugh tracks have become so 

ingrained in popular television 
that one may not even realize the 

effect it has on the show they are 
watching. Tuning in on the laugh 
track is like shattering the glass 
on a friend’s annoying habit: Once 
you notice it, there’s no going back. 
Take a look at what happens when 
the artificial laughter is removed 
from an episode. Without cues on 
what is and isn’t supposed to be a 
joke, all that’s left is an awkward 
and unsettling dialogue that feels 
as pitiful as looking into the living 
room window of a bachelor pad in 
Fort Wayne.

So why are these tracks so hated? 

General consensus points towards 
an annoyance at the induced 
chuckles, but studies show they still 
work. Some of the most beloved 
comedies have used laugh tracks, 
including “Seinfeld,” a show even a 
canned-laughter-hater like myself 
cannot help but enjoy. The success 
of laugh tracks relies on psychology 
and a bit of insecurity. In an 
interview with NBC, Dartmouth 
psychology professor Bill Kelley 
claimed “We’re much more likely 
to laugh at something funny in the 
presence of other people.” You hear 
that sheeple!? We’re all so obsessed 
with being accepted and included 
that we need others to decide when 
we should and should not laugh. To 
that I say: No more.

Some of the best comedies of the 

past and current decade are void 
of a laugh track. “30 Rock,” “It’s 
Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” 
“Curb Your Enthusiasm,” “Parks 
and Recreation,” “The Office,” 
“Veep” — the list goes on and on. 
Comedy has found its home in the 

mundane and the absurd, not the 
slapstick and the obvious. Why 
are the previously mentioned 
shows so popular? Why do they 
cause uproarious laughter without 
falsified cues? Because laugh tracks 
aren’t real life. They are an artificial 
corporate method that makes a 
TV show feel like a TV show. Yes, 
shows like “The Office” or “Curb” 
often implement some slapstick 
methods, but their humor comes 
in the fact that everyone can see 
their own lives in these characters, 
if not amplified versions. Everyone 
has seen outrageous antics in their 
place of work or ridiculed the way 
the government is run. We’ve all 
wondered what goes on behind the 
scenes of our favorite TV shows 
or poked fun at the bureaucracy. 
We’re already laughing — we don’t 
need sound engineers to tell us why.

Imagine if there were inserted 

gasps at every plot twist in 
“Westworld,” or inputted screams 
at every gunshot in “The Sopranos.” 
It would be a world of absolute 
entertainment chaos. Those who 
favor the laugh track will scorn 
this take, and lament why everyone 
can’t just enjoy what they want to. 
That is fine, everyone has different 
tastes, but I would like to add 
one more thing. Due to Charley 
Douglass’s monopoly on the laugh 
track, most of the soundbytes used 
today are the same ones used in 
the mid to late 20th century. Most 
of the laughs you hear today are 
coming from people who are now 
dead. Perhaps mortality is really 
the greatest joke of them all.

Laugh tracks, yada yada

CHELSEA LAUREN / WIREIMAGE

Despite their legality (or lack 
thereof), fake IDs are ubiquitous 
across 
college 
campuses. 
Responsible RAs warn against 
the commodity, citing the harsh 
consequences of owning one: “Up 
to one-year of incarceration, a fine 
of $2000, or both,” according to 
the Barone Defense Firm. Posters 
line the walls of freshman dorms 
informing students that selling a 
fake ID is a punishable felony that 
could lead to $10,000 in fines or 
up to 5 years of jail time, or both. 
And yet, the fake ID market still 
persists.
Fake IDs are an art form born 
out of necessity, and their muse? 
Senator Frank R. Lautenberg 
from New Jersey. In an act meant 
to combat drunk driving in the 
United States in 1984, Lautenberg 
raised the drinking age from 18 to 
21. The Prohibition Era showed 
us laws that take away a person’s 
access to alcohol won’t necessarily 
deter 
them 
from 
getting 
it 
anyways, so it makes sense that 
Lautenberg’s bill only served to 
create the fake ID market. There 
are genuine concerns regarding 
this rise in false identification, 
but underage college students just 
trying to have a good time maybe 
shouldn’t have been this country’s 
first priority.
The art of creating a fake 
ID is an elusive one — as the 
popularity of the false ID grew, 
so did state precautions. IDs may 
have everything from a fun bear 
outline when a light is shined 
on it to a fun “tricolor image of a 
bridge on the front that appears 
and disappears when viewed from 
different from different angles.” 
These characteristics are meant 
to make an ID harder to copy, and 
they do, but some see these simply 
as obstacles to overcome on their 
way to a night on the town.
With the rise of the internet, it’s 
not surprising that most students 
get their IDs from an online 
retailer. These sites, though, tend 
to rely on a business-minded 
student that act as middle-men, 
campus ID ambassadors if you 
will. These students are the key 
to the market — they gather the 
customers, their details and, just 
like a true artist, aren’t always 
proud of their final product.
In an email interview with The 
Daily, one anonymous student 
discussed the difficulties of getting 
an ID photo just right: “a white 
background ... no shadow showing 
behind the person.” Forget being 
able to take high quality Instagram 

photos or LinkedIn headshots, the 
value of a photographer lies in 
their ability to make a subject look 
fresh out of the DMV. Personally, 
this student “was not proud of the 
way (their fake ID) turned out, just 
because (they) feel that the picture 
was taken too far away.”
Just because the photo has strict 
guidelines doesn’t mean artists 
lose all semblance of creativity. 
This same student mentioned the 
fun behind being from a different 
state or being able to make “your 
new address to be a mansion or 
even a local McDonald’s.” Imagine 
that — for all Schlissel does to 
fight the drinking culture at the 
University, someone could have 
picked his address to deceive a 
bouncer or a clerk at the local 
liquor store. Inspiration can come 
from anywhere, too. Some people 
skip the “different state” thing 
altogether and go international, 
toting Irish or Chinese IDs that 
go unquestioned. But our source 
stressed that the only way to truly 
test your ID’s legitimacy (other 
than risk getting caught at a bar) 
“is to hold it side-by-side with a 
real ID from that state.”
That begs the question, though: 
Is a real (expired) ID of someone 
who looks like you better than 
a fake ID of you? The answer 
depends on your preferences. Just 
like some people prefer a Rococo 
era painting to that of a darker 
Renaissance piece, some like the 
comfort of knowing their ID is 
real rather than carrying around 
something totally fake. According 
to our source, one detail to keep in 
mind is the fact that “if the ID has 
another person’s name on it, but a 
picture of you, it is identity fraud” 
— a legal line that most people 
aren’t trying to cross when they 
make their fake ID.
Just like the stone or clay 
matters in sculpture, materials 
matter in the art of making 

fake IDs. Most state IDs use 
some kind of PVC plastic or a 
“synthetic paper material” called 
Teslin. Teslin is useful in its 
tear resistance and waterproof 
qualities. That said, it also a 
very easily accessible material, 
making it an ideal material for 
most fake IDs. One problem a 
counterfeiter may run into with 
Teslin, though, is the legibility 
of the inkjet printing, a simple 
problem that can be detrimental 
if not properly handled. Even still, 
some state IDs are made out of 
polycarbonate and will break in 
half upon enduring the infamous 
“bend test.” Our source even said 
others may even go so far as to 
steal a DMV ID machine, taking 
out some of the fun of figuring out 
what exactly goes into making an 
ID, but producing a high-quality 
ID nonetheless.
Aside from ordering a fake ID, 
there are numerous places where 
someone could learn how to 
make an ID themselves. One site, 
King of Fakes, offers a tutorial on 
how to DIY a fake ID — all you 
need is a printer, some photoshop 
skills and a template to follow for 
the ID. It seems simple, but like 
most DIY projects, it’s probably 
best left to the professionals. And 
despite improved technology, like 
3D printing, our source isn’t any 
more optimistic about the future 
of the DIY ID. To them, new 
technology “can’t make fake IDs 
more believable, because your ID 
is either real or fake.”
While it may seem a daunting 
task to make your own ID, no one 
ever became a renowned artist 
by being scared. The art of the 
fake ID is an untapped source of 
inspiration. If Billy McFarland 
was able to copy his debit card 
magnetic strip onto a piece of steel, 
successfully making your own fake 
ID is probably not too crazy of a 
dream — just an illegal one.

It’s 
surprisingly 
difficult 
to go back and re-establish a 
perspective of animation and 
children’s 
entertainment 
pre-
Pixar.
In his great TED Talk, Pixar 
animator Andrew Stanton (the 
second animator the company 
ever hired) talks about the 
expectations of the princess-
meets-prince adventure they had 
to fight against when pitching 
their first film. Stanton’s team 
rejected the pre-destined love, 
sing-along 
formula 
that 
had 
propelled “The Little Mermaid” 
and “Aladdin” to the top when 
they began work on “Toy Story,” 
approaching the film with their 
own set of criteria: No songs, no “I 
want” moments, no happy village 
and no love story.
“Toy Story” has become a 
watershed work both technically 
and for the genre as a whole. The 
film changed the way studios 
thought about what could be 
made, marketed and sold to the 
youngest slice of the box-office 
pie (and the parents dragged 
along with it). The massive 
success Pixar enjoyed post “Toy 
Story” paved the way for a new 
type of film to emerge — the Pixar 
imitator. Ignoring the other actual 
successful animation studios that 
have followed in Pixar’s wake 
(the Dreamworkses of the world), 
it’s much more fun to look at the 
other end of the spectrum, to 
shine a light on the crust scraped 
up from the bottom of the barrel.
The picture for this article 
includes the box-art for a horrible 
knockoff of Pixar’s “Up,” almost 
unbelievably called, “What’s Up: 

Balloon to the Rescue!” Ignoring 
the terrible attempt to fit the 
only recognizable word — Up 
— into their title, “What’s Up” 
represents a class of films that 
exist basically only to confuse 
or deceive people into watching 
them. The companies behind 
these monstrosities prey on all the 
poor-old, aloof-and-unassuming 
grandparents 
looking 
for 
birthday gifts in the Walmart 
bargain bin — as far as they know, 
they’re supporting the animation 
studio that has owned the Oscar 
category for the past two decades.
Within this class of terrible 
knockoffs, sometimes the movie 
on the disk isn’t even the same 
as the one on the packaging. It’s 
stupidly common for one of these 
knockoffs to ship a disk that isn’t 
at all related to the one on the 
cover. In a (pretty great) video 
by the YouTube channel “I Hate 
Everything” titled “The (NOT 
DISNEY) Collection,” the host 
revealed that two of the knockoffs 
he bought off Amazon, one called 
“Braver” and the other “Tangled 
Up,” were just rips of basic cable 
TV programming from the ’90s. 
The movie that was supposed 
to be “Braver” turned out to be 
a cartoon made-for-TV-movie 
about a Christmas princess. And 
even if you dodge the predatory-
ass bullet of a complete scam, like 
those named above, there’s a very 
non-zero chance that the DVD 
you just purchased is a renamed, 
reskinned 
and 
reimported 
foreign language animated film 
given a new, Pixar-ish title. See 
“Ratatoing.”
The actual movie content 
in each of these punishment 
packages is just god-awful, but it’s 
also kind of fun. For a buck a piece, 
you can own dozens of awful, 

good-for-nothing knockoffs that 
probably aren’t even bad enough 
to finish. But I get why people 
are so morbidly-curious to try 
these out. Names like “Chop-Kick 
Panda” and “A Cars Life” sound 
like 
terrible, 
groan-inducing 
jokes, so the fact that they’re 
“real” movies just begs you to give 
them a watch.
It’s interesting to see how the 
movie-internet rallies around this 
sort of cinema dredge. There’s a 
whole host of YouTube channels, 
blogs and podcasts dedicated to 
covering the worst of the worst 
of the worst when it comes to 
movies. Something is enticing 
about 
watching 
gruesome, 
catastrophic failures. Watching 
a bad movie that means well is 
often times much more painful 
than 
watching 
an 
alleyway 
dumpster fire of a movie with 
no redeeming qualities. This is 
probably similar to that deep 
psychological thing where we 
can’t not watch tragedies unfold. 
It’s a fight or flight thing — 
adrenaline pumping, we have to 
keep watching to make sure the 
bad movie doesn’t kill us.
It’s not unlikely that it’s us 
who are keeping these movies in 
circulation, not the video aisle 
grandpas. While we laugh at the 
mismatched mouth movements 
of the overdub, the production 
companies laugh their way to 
the bank. (I mean, it must cost 
like, a day and a half of work to 
crank one of these out, right?) 
But, you know, whatever. Keep 
‘em coming. They’re grating 
and grossly exploitative, but 
I don’t know if I have a better 
recommendation if you just want 
to sit and laugh with some friends. 
One or two tip-toes into cinema 
masochism never hurt.

B-SIDE: FILM

Summer 2018 reignited a 
seven-year-old beef between 
Pusha T and Drake, one that 
never has nor will be merciful 
to Drake. “The Story of Adidon” 
is the obvious apex to this 
chapter, with the revelation of 
Drake’s decision to unveil his 
son’s existence only to promote 
his Adidas line coming as a 
low move. The publication and 
media attention understandably 

proved to overshadow other 
revelations of Drake’s sleazy 
character. But throughout the 
whole saga, Pusha T echoes the 
same information that set the 
rap community on fire in 2015: 
Drake makes extensive use of 
ghost writers. Perhaps it’s just 
not all that shocking anymore — 
we’ve all heard that joke about 
“The Weeknd writing half of 
Drake’s best album.” But it was 
a different story when Meek 
Mill first spilled the beans on 
Twitter four years ago.
This isn’t to say that Drake 
is the only person with a ghost 

writer. Some of the biggest 
artists in the industry, from 
Frank Ocean, to rap legend Jay-
Z, got their start ghostwriting 
for other artists. The market’s 
full of them. But it only ever 
seems to be called out when a 
rapper — not a pop artist, not 
a country singer, not a rock 
star — is faking it. Why all the 
intense scrutiny?
The thing with rap is it’s 
nothing 
without 
its 
flows. 
Whereas the lyrical content of a 
pop song or country ballad can 
be overlooked for its production 
and musical stylings, rap’s all 

about the message it conveys. 
The production is important, 
certainly, but it follows the cues 
of the words and story of the 
rapper. Unlike other song lyrics, 
those of a rap song are generally 
more 
meticulously 
composed 
into 
bars 
with a lot of wit and 
creative 
conventions 
tying them together. 
It’s more about being 
smart than it is making 
people dance.
Take these lyrics by 
Pusha T for example 
(you 
know, 
while 
we’re 
on 
the 
topic 
of ghost writing and 
Drake): “The game’s 
fucked up / N***a’s 
beats is bangin’, n***a, 
ya hooks did it / The 
lyric 
pennin’ 
equal 
the Trumps winnin’ 
/ The bigger question 
is how the Russians 
did it / It was written 
like Nas, but it came 
from 
Quentin.” 
The 
lyrics are deft, chock 
full 
of 
imagery, 
rhymes, 
metaphors 
and wordplay. Yet it’s 
still captivating and 
memorable, 
despite 
lacking 
the 
same 
catchy quotables you’d 
expect from a different 
genre’s chorus. There’s 
more at stake when 
you cheat in the rap 
game; you claim more than 
you’re capable of.
That 
being 
said, 
more 
importantly, 
the 
lyrics 
tell 
a story. Rap prides itself on 
the element of “realness,” the 
capacity to speak to specific 

experiences 
and 
people 
in 
extensive detail. Rap, more 
than any other genre, also faces 
unfair critique and judgement 
before it’s even listened to, 
many music listeners are quick 

to excuse it as meaningless 
by virtue of their superficial 
understanding of it — they can’t 
fathom rap beyond the “gangsta 
rap” trope.
And perhaps that’s why the 
urge to protect the genre is 

such a pivotal part of the rap 
community. It comes from a 
history where a large majority 
of the people who listened to it 
and took it seriously were the 
people who experienced the 
stories it told. Because 
rap started with the 
Black 
community, 
the 
majority 
white, 
middle-class American 
crowd did not consider 
it 
a 
serious 
music 
genre. 
The 
genre 
is often reduced to 
harmful and negative 
stereotypes 
of 
drug 
dealing, philandering 
and bravado without 
much consideration for 
how these topics might 
fit into a song with 
much deeper meaning 
to it. This considered, 
faking 
your 
art 
is 
blasphemous 
not 
only 
because 
you’re 
lying, 
but 
because 
you 
steal 
someone 
else’s experience and 
personality by doing 
so. You de-legitimize 
a genre that demands 
it be taken seriously 
despite the critique of 
a judgemental, racist 
world.
Kendrick 
Lamar 
puts 
it 
simply: 
“I 
called myself the best 
rapper. I cannot call 
myself the best rapper 
if I have a ghostwriter.” In a 
rap game where the true test 
comes in honing your skills 
and not falling victim to the 
expectations of other people, 
legitimacy is what gets you 
respect.

Cleansing unoriginal sin: 
Ghostwriting in hip-hop

Rap prides itself on the 
element of “realness,” the 
capacity to speak to specific 
experiences and people in 
extensive detail. Rap, more 
than any other genre, also 
faces unfair critique and 
judgment before it’s even 
listened to, and many music 
listeners are quick to excuse 
it as meaningless

Just as musicians found a 
way aroudn the expensive 
establishment methods 
of music distribution, 
students are exploring 
different channels of 
acquiring textbooks. I 
know this sounds like a 
leap, but stay with me.

ALEC COHEN /. DAILY

In 1942, a radio station 
director 
named 
George 
Goodwin published a set of 
three inch by five inch cards. 
The front of each card was 
printed with the most basic 
musical 
information 
about 
a song — lyrics, notes — and 
the back had text about the 
song’s authors, publishers and 
copyright holders. Goodwin 
called 
this 
collection 
the 
Tune-Dex, 
and 
it 
would 
change music forever.
Goodwin’s Tune-Dex was 
based off the card catalogue 
system, an apparatus that 
was 
for 
many 
years 
the 
basis 
of 
every 
library’s organizational 
structure. 
In 
1942, 
Goodwin placed a full-
page advertisement in 
“Variety,” 
calling 
his 
creation the “First and 
Only Permanent Living 
Index of Popular Music.”
Tune-Dex was one of 
the 
first 
subscription 
services, 
delivering 
new 
cards 
to 
those 
who had applied for 
“charter subscription.” 
In the days before the 
internet, musicians had 
to contact publishers for 
sheet music. The whole 
process 
was 
labor-
intensive and expensive, 
and it didn’t really serve 
the needs of people who 
wanted to learn new, 
popular music. Tune-
Dex was intended for 
professional 
musicians 
who 
needed 
to 
pick 
up songs very quickly 
and didn’t have time to 
contact the copyright 
holders. Radio stations 
and 
lounge 
owners 
were 
also 
interested 
in 
keeping 
up 
with 
the latest hits, but it 
wouldn’t 
have 
made 
sense for them to order 
sheet 
music 
either. 
Somehow, 
Goodwin 
convinced 
publishers 
to let him copy and sell 
abbreviated 
versions 
of their music. When 
Goodwin died in 1965, 
the Tune-Dex monopoly — 
which was largely a one-man 
operation — came to an end.
But Goodwin’s idea had 
caught on, and musicians 
(and other interested parties) 
were no longer willing to buy 
hundreds of pages of loose-leaf 
sheet music from publishing 
companies. Beginning in the 
1940s, cocktail lounges were 
springing up everywhere, a 
mix between a bar, a dance 
hall and a restaurant where 
you could drink and hang out 
while listening to live music. 
The musicians who played at 
these places were often asked 
by patrons to play current 
hits, a feat which was much 
easier if they had Tune-Dex 
cards for the songs. Musicians 
wanted something convenient 
and 
cheap 
to 
help 
them 
navigate the flexibility they 
were now expected to have. 
Tune-Dex cards were easier 
to carry around than sheet 

music and helped musicians 
keep up with the latest songs, 
but the cards could easily be 
lost, so when Goodwin died, 
the Tune-Dex concept was 
altered slightly. Abbreviated 
songs were formatted as “fake 
books,” a way for musicians to 
keep track of tunes they had 
heard once or twice, but didn’t 
know well enough to play 
without some foundational 
direction.
Music 
publishing 
companies didn’t create these 
fake books, so musicians were 
forced to go underground. 
This is how the bootleg fake 
book industry was born; out of 
necessity, not maliciousness, 

and in response to the changes 
in 
audience 
demand 
and 
performance styles that were 
recognized by musicians, but 
not copyright holders.
This 
is 
a 
moderately 
interesting 
(if 
technical) 
anecdote in the recent history 
of the music industry. It’s 
also a useful example of how 
publishing 
and 
copyright 
companies 
have 
difficulty 
keeping up with cultural and 
technological changes. The 
story of fake books is about 
both publishing and music, 
about the ways that words are 
protected by the law and how 
artists find ways to say the 
things they want to anyway.
Copyright and art has a 
very 
complicated 
history. 
Copyright 
law 
protects 
artists and creators, but it 
also limits the consumers 
of their work, meaning that 
the same channels through 
which an artist can make 

a living are also the ones 
that can prevent them from 
gaining experience and an 
audience. Fake books are an 
example of a phenomenon 
that can be found anywhere 
copyrighted content gets too 
expensive 
or 
burdensome. 
Just as musicians found a 
way around the expensive 
establishment 
methods 
of 
music distribution, students 
are 
exploring 
different 
channels 
of 
acquiring 
textbooks. I know this seems 
like a leap, but stay with me.
In recent years, textbooks 
have become so expensive 
that many students simply 
cannot 
afford 
them; 
Vox 
reported an 88 percent 
increase in prices from 
2006 to 2016. There are 
a few reasons behind 
this. 
Textbooks 
now 
often come with single-
use access codes for 
online 
materials, 
and 
the lack of competition 
(five companies own 80 
percent of the market) 
means publishers don’t 
need to worry about 
students 
buying 
a 
cheaper version of their 
product.
The strategies that 
textbook 
publishers 
are 
using 
to 
make 
their 
products 
more 
affordable 
are 
not 
cutting 
it. 
Cengage, 
for 
example, 
offers 
subscription 
services, 
so that students can 
have online access to 
a number of textbooks 
for one price — but that 
option can be nearly 
$180 per semester, with 
a firm access expiration 
date and no possibility 
for reselling.
In response, students 
have found a solution 
that 
takes 
a 
similar 
approach as fake books: 
open access textbooks. 
Free the Textbook is 
a 
non-profit 
working 
to help students and 
professors 
create 
a 
new 
culture 
around 
textbooks. 
They 
ask 
professors to consider 
the cost of textbooks 
when 
assigning 
material, 
stop requiring students to 
buy access to quizzes and 
homework 
and 
collaborate 
with librarians and scholars 
to create high-quality, open 
source textbooks.
Like fake books, the open 
access movement is about 
fixing an issue that publishing 
companies have so far been 
unable to address adequately. 
While 
it’s 
important 
to 
compensate 
authors, 
the 
current 
textbook 
system 
prioritizes corporate profit 
over 
students’ 
education. 
Luckily, students and their 
professors are finding new, 
innovative 
ways 
to 
make 
knowledge more accessible. 
Open access textbooks are the 
fake books of higher education, 
a way to democratize an 
industry 
by 
providing 
students with knowledge in 
a way that is both accessible 
and affordable.

B-SIDE: BOOK REVIEW

‘I Wanna Marry Harry ’

in this series, three daily arts writers in 
varying states of mind visit the same 
place and write about their experiences.

baked.buzzed.bored.

this week’s destination:

Some call me a stoner with too much free time to watch television. I call myself 
a cultural anthropologist who, with the assistance of THC, has the abil-
ity to consistently (sniff out?) the top tier of pop culture. The next 
throwback on my queue was a little ditty called “I Wanna 
Marry ‘Harry,’” originally broadcasted on none other 
than FOX, the Rupert Murdoch owned-network 
responsible for such greats as “My Big Fat 
Obnoxious Boss” and “Mr. Personality.”
Entering into this show in a 
post-Meghan Markle world, I 
was a bit critical. How would this 
make my Lord and Savior/part-time 
Queen of the Blacks™, the Duchess of Sussex 
look? Is this their meeting story? Then, I realized 
that this show was not only American-produced, but 
also was made years ago, and I looked in the mirror and 
felt like a reallll dipshit. So, here we are at the beginning of the 
show. The show started off on a strong foot by hiring a man who isn’t 
even British, but from Papua New Guinea. His accent was great. Appar-
ently, the FAKE Prince Harry they hired has a “93% face match” to the actual 
Windsor. Nope, you read that correctly. The FOX Network used fake science as a 
justification for a mediocre doppelganger. His name is Matt Hicks, and if you’re won-
dering if he seemed stable enough to participate in this pseudo-social experiment and not 
experience an immense power trip, he most certainly is not.
This particular quality in Matt — the gradual formation of the belief that he truly 
is Prince Harry — comprises the bulk of the reason why the meat of the show became 
unwatchable for me. Or, at least unwatchable without wincing because I was locked into 
that baby for a good three ‘sodes. The biggest question I ran into was whether or not the 
women (read: Charlotte Russe managers turned “actresses”) actually knew that this guy 
was a nobody, or if some of them actually lived in the delusion that the royal family would 
actually participate in a reality show wherein the women wear jean cutoffs as formal wear. 
Legally, they dodged the whole “identity fraud” thing by only referring to Matt as “sir.” So, 
if you think about it, there was a lot of leeway for the women to actually believe that this 
really was Prince Harry, so much so that the entire B-arc of the show was centered around 
the few daring women inside the house that began to question — weeks in — if this all 
seemed a bit too good to be true.

Man, this show is really boring. It’s not even bad in the fun 
way, it’s just a huge drag.
The premise is as ridiculous as it sounds — a “Bachelor” 
type show with the man in question being a “lookalike” of 
Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex. Twelve vapid stereotypically-
American women vie for his affection over the course of sev-
eral weeks. At first they are not told that the man is Prince 
Harry, it is merely suggested that it may be. Later, they are 
told that he is, in fact, royalty. Aside from being stupid, the 
concept is pretty creepy as well, the deception being a stone’s 
throw away from wearing a mask of human skin a la Ed Gein.
Most reality television requires some suspension of dis-
belief, but this is insane. There is a less-than-zero percent 
chance that these women did not figure out that that this 
bland rock-kicker was not in the line of succession to the 
British throne. It’s not like they didn’t have clues — aside 
from the important fact that he doesn’t resemble Prince 
Harry in the slightest, his accent isn’t correct, he suffered 
from an acute case of flop sweat and his “security detail” was 
wearing sunglasses that look like they came from the clear-
ance rack at Bass Pro Shops.
I had hoped that getting drunk would make it more enjoy-
able, but alcohol was no match for the fucking awfulness of 
this show. It did, however, help me identify what the intend-
ed purpose of this trainwreck was — performative cruelty, 
designed to make you laugh at the vapidness and greed of 
the contestants. I can see how this could be a funny concept, 
even if it is mean-spirited, but it just wasn’t. The contestants 
weren’t interesting enough, the “prince” was bland and the 
drama wasn’t that dramatic.

I dabble in dating shows. Bachelor in Paradise is fantastic. How-
ever, I dabble less in the Royal Family, and this is apparently true 
for the average American, hence the mere existence of “I Wanna 
Marry ‘Harry.’”
This obscene show works as follows: A bunch of women who 
share the acute, American awareness of the celebrity of the Royal 
Family, their knowledge fueled by tabloids depicting Prince Har-
ry’s Las Vegas buttox scandal and the Queen’s hats, are taken to an 
English estate to be the victims of a seriously creepy ruse 
in which an “Environmental Consultant” pretends 
to be Prince Harry in the hopes that one woman 
(or many — this guy was horny as shit) will fall 
in love with him and remain in love with him 
when he finally reveals his true identity as an 
“Environmental Consultant.”
That was a mouthful, and it’s almost 
impossible to believe that such a ludacris 
show actually aired on FOX before it was 
pulled after four episodes. Now, I could 
easily deride the show, but I’m not going to 
do that. The show is supposed to be derid-
ed. Instead, I’d like to interpret it charita-
bly.
I’ve really never seen anything like “I 
Wanna Marry ‘Harry.’” It poses quite an inter-
esting interplay between fantasy and reality, 
something akin to a reality TV-regular TV hybrid. 
Kingsley, fake Harry’s butler, is literally acting, grant-
ed very poorly, like a royal butler for the entire show, even 
when interacting with fake Harry. The same goes for all of the other 
service members that are meant to create the illusion of royalty — 
it’s like the Walmart version of the Walmart version of Downton 
Abbey. On the other hand, the show is riddled with typical reality 
TV tropes: mean girls, random shouting, the sense that the entire 
episode is one big trailer and surgically repaired audio clips that 
sound like Siri explaining why the girl who gets to stay in the master 
bedroom with fake Harry is actually a bitch. So in one foul swoop, 
you get people playing a part alongside people that are supposedly

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com


You can’t step foot on campus 
without seeing at least one 
person clad in Greek life apparel 
inspired by pop culture. Hoodies 
in the vein of Travis Scott’s 
Astroworld 
merchandise, 
but 
with 
“Alphaworld” 
instead. 
Bape-inspired T-shirts that say 
“A BATHING AEPI.” Sometimes 
Greek Letter Organization (GLO) 
apparel is so smoothly designed 
that at a glance, you can’t tell it’s 
not the original — what I thought 
was a Champion reverse weave 
hoodie actually said “Delta” on 
the left-chest logo.
The 
branded 
nature 
of 
Greek life shouldn’t come as 
any surprise: The University of 
Michigan might be the world’s 
most heavily-branded school, and 
fittingly, its student body is very 
brand-conscious in their choice of 
apparel.
Part of me detected a nefarious 
capitalist 
invasion 
on 
our 
identities pervading campus. I’m 
reminded of the fashion world’s 
favorite Calvin and Hobbes comic 
strip. In it Calvin wishes his 
shirt had a logo on it — “It says 
to the world, ‘My identity is so 
wrapped up in what I buy that I 
paid the company to advertise its 
products!’”
At first, I thought brand-
inspired GLO apparel was the 
fucked-up final form of this 
phenomenon. I myself am a Greek 
life outsider, and I initially saw 
people whose personas were 
conflated with companies to the 
point that they couldn’t make 

the choice between representing 
their Greek org or their cultured 
(read: 
wealthy) 
taste 
for 
expensive brands. There exists a 
widely-held belief that Greek life 
is full of silver-spoon white people 
with no perspective on reality 
— something that quickly falls 
apart when you meet someone in 
Greek life and find out that they’re 
real people — but nonetheless, 
it exists. Seeing students with a 
Greek letter Supreme box logo 
imitation feeds into that image.
I say at first because I’ve 
checked my ego since then. Really, 

I’m no exception to the rule: I too 
live for clothing brands. There are 
some companies I adore because 
they are minimally branded — 
Uniqlo comes to mind — but I love 
having Nikes on my feet. It’s a sad 
day for me if the waistband of my 
underwear doesn’t have “Tommy 
Hilfiger” wrapped around it.
Not only that, but some of these 
designs are actually super clever. 
My older brother, a devout Sigma 
Pi at Grand Valley State University, 
once came home for the summer 

with a T-shirt that had the van 
from the deluxe edition cover 
of Kendrick Lamar’s Good Kid, 
M.A.A.D. City photoshopped in 
front of their fraternity house. 
There I saw the potential in these 
pop culture parodies. For every 
shitty Supreme bogo knockoff, 
there was a brilliant parody. I 
sometimes even wish I was in a 
fraternity as the apparel chair, so 
I could come up with something 
clever for my brothers to wear. 
Has anybody made a Greek life 
hoodie with the Quaker Oats logo 
yet?

But the question is: How are 
these t-shirts born? Where does 
GLO apparel come from? That’s 
what this B-Side’s curious editor 
asked, smelling a vast conspiracy 
underneath all this merchandise 
mimicry. Her request for an 
interview 
with 
Underground 
Printing 
turned 
up 
short; 
according to them, the company 
managing 
licensing 
for 
GLO 
apparel — more on that later — has 
strict guidelines and “Generally 
speaking, they do not allow 

(those) imitations and parodies.” 
But that couldn’t be the end of it, 
could it?
The case went cold, and I was 
prepared to do a deep-dive on 
Greek imitations based on my 
own speculation and suspicion. 
Frantically I texted my older 
brother, begging him to tell me 
where the hell those clothes 
came from. Then a friend of a 
friend of a friend led us to Greek 
Dressing. At last, we found it: An 
apparel company that seemed 
to specialize in just the kind 
of merchandise on which I’m 
writing 
about 
now. 
Tuesday 
afternoon, I caught up with the 
brains behind the operation.
LSA senior Everest Guerra 
laid the groundwork for Greek 
Dressing in the early part of 
his college career. “Freshman, 
sophomore year, I noticed my 
fraternity was making a lot of 
apparel,” Guerra said. “Like a lot a 
lot of apparel. Like $30,000 a year 
in apparel.”
That may sound like a stretch, 
but some napkin mathematics told 
me that number was very realistic. 
For bigger fraternities, with 150 
or more brothers each dropping 
$200 or more on clothing over 
a year, that $30,000 number is 
right in sight. Now multiply that 
$200 figure times 4,200 students 
involved 
in 
Greek 
life. 
The 
University of Michigan alone has 
a multi-hundred-thousand-dollar 
per year Greek apparel industry. 
That’s a lot of design work, a lot 
of transactions, a lot of logistics. 
That’s where companies like 
Greek Dressing come in.
Guerra saw those complications 
in his own fraternity’s apparel 
production. “The designs weren’t 
that cool … the process for 
ordering was really hard … there 
just wasn’t a really good system for 
it. And I kinda saw an opportunity 
to improve on the system we had.”
Greek 
Dressing 
was 
born 
to solve those problems. The 
process is simple: Fraternities 
and sororities bring their ideas 
for apparel to their campus 
representative. 
An 
in-house 
design team renders a proof, 
and through an online feedback 
platform, the campus reps go back 
and forth with their client until a 
final design is produced. A private 
web store is constructed for the 
client where their members can 
purchase the clothes themselves. 
Then the garments are produced 
(usually by a local printer in 
Detroit) and fulfilled by Greek 
Dressing.
When I first read the local 
printer’s response to my editor’s 
interview request saying that 
Greek apparel imitating popular 
brands were not allowed, an image 
was conjured in my mind of GLOs 
working to produce clothing in 
the dark so that their rip-offs 
could survive in the light. But as it 
turns out, a sophisticated system 

underlies their production.
A quick peek at the Greek 
Dressing lookbook shows that pop 
culture references play a big part 
in their design philosophy. Guerra 
explained that they incorporate 
those 
references 
into 
their 
designs to set them apart from 

other companies doing a similar 
thing (as it turns out, there are 
many). Some orgs know exactly 
what they want, but others go 
through a sometimes lengthy 
design process.
“One of our clients is going to 
Toronto for a formal, and they just 
asked us to come up with a couple 
different designs,” Guerra said. “I 
think we’re on like design eight 
now. We got to eight, we selected 
one, which is really awesome. 
But for us it was like, OK, what’s 
important to Toronto? Drake is 
obviously a staple of Toronto, 
the Toronto Raptors are a pretty 
staple team, the Leafs, or anything 
like that. So we’ll think of pop 
culture references and try to build 
those into a lot of our garments.”
On the legal side, Guerra 
mentioned the same licensing 
company that the local printer did: 
Affinity Licensing, the governing 
body of all GLO trademarks. To 
produce Greek apparel, first a 
vendor needs to get licensed with 
Affinity, but it’s not a blanket 
license. A separate license is 
needed 
for 
each 
individual 
organization. It can be difficult 
for a small company. There are 
up-front costs associated with 
obtaining a single license. Every 
organization then has its own 
guidelines for what designs can 
be used. And of course, those 
organizations collect royalties on 
every design with their letters on 
it.
Whenever Guerra’s team makes 
a design, it goes through Affinity, 
who give it an approval or denial. 

This makes it a little easier on 
companies like Greek Dressing 
when it comes to the use of pop 
culture and existing brands. It’s a 
sort of legal grey area. I imagine 
their brand-based designs fall 
under fair use as a parody, or 
something similar. Whatever the 
technicalities are, the licensing 
company will give the thumbs up 
or thumbs down on each design.
“We made a cool Chance the 
Rapper tee and they were totally 
fine with it,” Guerra said. “But 
then we made an Off-White tee, 
and they were like, ‘No, you can’t 
use that brand.’” As his artists have 
become more and more familiar 
with what is and isn’t allowed, 
they’ve been able to anticipate 
when a design won’t get approved 
so they can advise clients to pick 
something different.
Designing apparel based on 
what’s trending is a tricky game 
because of how quickly things go 
in and out of fashion. “A Drake 
reference, 
that 
might 
work 
last month because Drake just 
dropped a new song, (but) it’s not 
gonna work in six months because 
that pop culture reference is 
played out, there’s going to be a 
million people who’ve already 
done it,” Guerra said. “We did an 
Astroworld one, and then we saw 
similar stuff coming out around 
the same time, so it’s hard to 
know sometimes who was first,” 
he added.
Interestingly, 
Guerra 
noted 
patterns among different orgs for 
what kind of references they like to 
use. “I’ve done enough University 
of Michigan organizations that I 
kind of know this organization is 
gonna be into more of the hip-hop 
pop culture references, this ones 
gonna be more into sports pop 
culture references, and this one 
just wants some crazy artwork, 
they don’t want any pop culture 
references,” he explained.
The 
conversation 
proved 
eye-opening: The underbelly of 
brand-based Greek life apparel 
was no conspiracy after all. Like 
all things Greek life, everything 
is written, set in stone under well-
documented procedure. As for the 
designs themselves, they are the 
medium for a creative race, a rush 
among fraternities and sororities 
to come up with the trendiest, 
coolest and cleverest design. 
Services like Greek Dressing have 
found a comfortable place in that 
race.
Is there a conversation to be 
had about “the American way to 
express individuality”? Maybe, 
maybe. But Greek life apparel is 
not necessarily the “final form” of 
that thinking like I once imagined 
it. It’s another avenue upon which 
“the American way” manifests 
itself, but it’s a cool one, if I say 
so myself. Greek life has turned 
pop culture references into a 
new, distinctly American form of 
creativity.

Pop culture fetches a high 
price for Greek life merch

B-SIDE SECONDARY

The fashion knockoff industry 
has been in business for possibly 
as long as the fashion industry 
itself. It is common knowledge 
that products created by high-
end designers like Gucci and 
Chanel are the dreams of many, 
only to be afforded by few. 
Thereby, the fashion knockoff 
industry has now become the 
one-stop solution for the masses. 

I say “industry” because the 
magnitude of businesses working 
in the field of making copycat 
products — namely bags, belts and 
even apparel — is astonishing, to 
say the least.
Furthermore, this industry is 
now morphing into an economy 
that shows no signs of slowing 
down, especially as the desire for 
exclusive products is becoming 
increasingly ubiquitous thanks 
to social media and the rise 
of 
influencers. 
The 
famed 
interlocking 
Gucci 
belt 
has 

become adorned by so many 
Instagram stars that it no longer 
stands out against Yeezys and 
other 
trademark 
streetwear 
goods, which now dominate the 
social sphere.
Some 
argue 
the 
copycat 
economy is founded on the basis 
of a crime: theft of design. This 
is true to a certain extent. Many 
believe that it, like any business, 
is simply fulfilling an existing 
gap in the market, matching 
the supply to the great demand 
and capitalizing on a lucrative 

business opportunity. Business 
and morals have often conflicted 
with one another, and this is no 
exception. Time and time again, 
critics have cried out against the 
rather unknown masterminds 
pulling the strings of the knockoff 
industry, and lawsuits have been 
filed, but to no avail. The fact of 
the matter is that this economy 
operates more like a complex web 
spread across the world, far too 
flawless in their working to be 
rooted out.
While 
exclusive 
brands 
charging thousands of dollars 
rightfully 
call 
those 
in 
the 
business of copying wrong, Coco 
Chanel 
herself 
very 
frankly 
admitted that knockoffs were 
simply the “ransom of success.” 
The economic impact is similar 
to a pendulum — it could 
swing either way. Often, when 
knockoffs are easily available, 
genuine customers are naturally 
less willing to shell out large 
sums of money when they find 
others enjoying the same sense 
of exclusiveness at a much lower 
cost. This possibly leads to lower 
brand loyalty, since loyalty is a 
subjective aspect, closely related 
to the availability of alternatives.
However, not all designs can be 
replicated, and definitely not all 
imitations are of similar quality to 
the original. There might be a few 
extremely well-made knockoffs 
that are almost impossible to 
distinguish from the genuine 
product, unless you were to 
examine its every intricacy: from 
the lining, to the material, to the 
type of stitch used. Moreover, 
some designs are products of 
the 
brand 
monopolizing 
on 
its superior finish, production 
technique and detail-oriented 

work, making them simply too 
difficult to copy. For example, 
replicas of the Balenciaga city 
bag often struggle to find similar 
high-quality leather quality with 
the right amount of shine.
What’s even more important 
than 
simply 
discussing 
the 
nuances of replication is the 
realization 
that 
the 
fashion 
knockoff industry is not limited to 
simply making knockoffs. It also 
includes some very popular and 
commonplace brands, all lumped 
under the category of fast fashion. 
While you can guess what these 
brands are, I am referring to 
common favourites, like Zara and 
H&M, who are indeed infamous 
for churning out designs similar 
to those seen on the runway in 
shockingly little time.
These brands work on the basis 
of microseasons and are able to 
rehaul their entire lines to match 
Fashion Week designs in as much 
or even less time it takes for the 
exclusive fashion houses to bring 
their collections from the ramp 
to their window displays. These 
brands are well-oiled machines 
with a clear system in place. The 
inclusion of these large, global 
companies 
into 
the 
copycat 
economy exponentially increases 
the size of the industry and not 
only normalizes a part of it, but 
even legalizes it. However, these 
multinational corporations are 
not without their own set of 
troubles.
The rise of fast fashion in 
the past decade has completely 
transformed how this age-old 
system 
works. 
Demand 
has 
skyrocketed 
because 
many 
consumers have come to rely on 
clothing from these cheap and 
easy brands, as they unknowingly 

become involved in this unspoken 
side of the knockoff industry.
In today’s age, the knockoff 
industry 
continues 
to 
grow 
with the introduction of online 
shopping 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
replication isn’t simply limited 
to high-end designers anymore. 
Companies based in China, like 
SheIn, are known for ripping 
off designs from more common 
stores and selling them for dirt-
cheap. They seem too be to 
good to be true, and they often 
are, thanks to their mediocre 
quality material and large-scale 
production.
What is even more amusing 
about this business of knockoffs 
is that it’s not a one way street. 
Often times, large companies, 
the likes of which include Old 
Navy and Anthropologie, have 
been accused of profiteering by 
copying the work of individual 
designers. 
This 
stream 
of 
interaction is received more with 
anger, because the masses seem 
to feel wronged in knowing that 
companies to which they shell 
out their own hard-earned money 
are profiting by stealing another 
artist’s work. The last piece of 
this puzzle is the legal aspect: I 
was surprised to find that much 
of the replication that occurs is 
legal, since small-scale designers 
often do not trademark their 
graphics or images. Furthermore, 
there have even been cases of 
designer fashion houses copying 
work, including Saint Laurent, 
Gucci and Off-White just to name 
a few. This just goes to show that 
this industry is not restricted 
by the type of product, or the 
imminence of the brand involved, 
but functions only according to 
one thing — the bottom line.

Unnecessary antitheses: 
Perspectives on ‘realness’

JOSEPH FRALEY/ DAILY

JULIANNA MORANO
Daily Arts Writer

B-SIDE LEAD

I read Monica Youn’s “Stealing 
the Scream,” a poem narrativizing 
the theft of Edvard Munch’s 
famous 
Expressionist 
painting, 
and, without hesitation, I rooted 
for the thief. How could I not? In 
the third stanza, Youn scoffs at 
the museum security, outwitted 
by the thief, only for the walls of 
the museum itself to join in: “the 
guards rushing in — too late! — 
greeted only / by the gap-toothed 
smirk of the museum walls.” By the 
next, Youn paints the picture of a 
misunderstood vigilante-prophet. 
A rogue Moses? “Someone has the 
answers, someone who, grasping 
the frame, / saw his sun-red face 
reflected in that familiar boiling 
sky,” Youn concludes.
Then, I second-guessed myself. 
Cheering on art theft would 
certainly make me an enemy of 
museums, which, on the contrary, 
I have always cherished and 
respected. I wondered: Was I also 
making myself an enemy of art?
At the same time, I don’t think 
Youn’s ultimate aim is for her 
readers to weigh the ethics of 
art theft. Rather, Youn seems 
to be posing a more reasonable, 
worthwhile challenge, and that is 
to interrogate assumptions about 
the proper place for a work of art. 
She dares us to ask ourselves: where 
does art live? Where can art live? Is 
it always ideal to keep art cooped up 
inside? What does art gain and lose 
when it flies the coop? And I think 
the underlying question here is:
Is it an artwork’s place in a 
museum that gives it meaning — 
that makes it real?
I spoke to three women with 
backgrounds in museum work and 
studies, and I asked them the same 
question, though perhaps not in so 
many words. They had some things 
to say about the traditional, fixed 
conceptions of what makes a work 
of art real. They had much more to 
say about possible alternatives.

Is art only real if it’s inside of 
a museum?

Jillian 
Reese, 
community 
program manager at the Detroit 
Institute 
of 
Arts, 
respectfully 
disagrees with that question. She’s 
uniquely poised to make such a call, 
as a figure in the museum world at 
once invested in the DIA itself and 
the external communities with 
which it engages.

One of the most successful 
programs Reese has helped bring to 
multiple communities in Southeast 
Michigan is Inside|Out, in which 
the DIA exports reproductions of 
original artworks housed inside 
the museum and installs these 
reproductions in various outdoor 
venues of Detroit’s surrounding 
communities.
“There are things that an art 
museum can’t do,” she began, then 
chuckled and corrected herself, 
“I shouldn’t say can’t. There are 
things that museums don’t do that 
community collections can do.”
Reese 
identified 
one 
chief 
advantage of this transportation 
of reproductions beyond the walls 
of the museum: “We’re meeting 
people where they’re at … they 
don’t have to come down to 5200 
Woodward Avenue to see the art.”
In 
addition, 
rather 
than 
de-contextualizing art, Inside|Out 
re-contextualizes art in new, open 
air environs. “When you remove 
these images from their context 
in the gallery, and you put it in 
unfamiliar space, it adds this sort 
of whimsy. It’s fun and funny and 
irreverent for a Van Gogh to be 
in a park where it can get rained 
on,” and Reese laughed as she 
continued, “pooped on by a bird, 
all that sort of stuff.” On a more 
serious note, she addressed the 
osmotic 
meaning-making 
that 
this recontextualization enacts, 
arguing that it “allows people to 
have a chance to really notice it and 
to look at it a little deeper. It starts to 
inspire you in thinking about your 
environment in a different way.”
Along a similar vein, Inside|Out 
proceeds 
from 
a 
teaching 
methodology 
that 
the 
DIA 
espouses called “visual thinking 
strategies,” which prize the role art 
appreciators play in constructing 
the meaning of a work of art. “You 
bring something to an artwork,” 
Reese stressed. “How you read the 
artwork is influenced by that.” In 
turn, she said, “We really try to use 
Inside|Out pieces and images that 
will spark that sort of explanation.” 
In this way, Inside|Out provides 
an opportunity for individuals to 
make a personal connection with 
artwork that a gallery in a museum 
may not, our eyes tempted by the 
explanatory labels that seem to 
accompany every artwork. The 
authenticity of these Inside|Out 
reproductions 
notwithstanding, 
is that connection anything but 
real? Would anyone dare call those 
processes 
of 
meaning-making 

inauthentic?
The progressive gestures of 
Inside|Out have not proceeded 
without 
resistance. 
“I 
think 
that the people who had the 
the largest pushback against it 
was our curatorial staff,” Reese 
explained. “Librarians, registrars, 
programmers, 
educators 
in 
the art museums saw this as a 
democratization of art: access 
to the arts for more people,” in 
Reese’s experience, whereas “A 
lot of curators thought, well, why 
would they come to the museum if 
they could just Google the image 
to see it on your screen,” carrying 

a similar attitude toward physical 
reproductions.
Reese’s response? Increasing 
access to the arts, whether in the 
form of digitization or material 
reproduction and exportation via 
programs like Inside|Out, does 
not make the museum obsolete. 
“There’s enough space for both,” 
she argued, adding that “anyone 
who has gone to a museum knows 
there’s a big difference” between 
the originals housed in the DIA and 
their reproductions on the internet 
and in Inside|Out installations. 
“There’s no comparison. They 
serve two different purposes.”
Yet 
these 
two 
forms 
of 
participation are not mutually 
exclusive, either, and Reese has 
the research to back it up. “With 
Inside|Out, we have evidence that, 
in every community that we install 
in, during and after the installation, 
for about a year, we see a spike 
in attendance at the museum.” 
Laughing, she elaborated, “People 
look at (an Inside|Out installation) 
and say, ‘Maybe the DIA isn’t as 
stuffy as I thought it was.’” Rather 
than sapping the authenticity of 
art, Reese’s program attests to 
the amplification of an artwork’s 
meaning once it moves beyond its 
walls, to the multiplication of the 
authentic experiences with art. In 
many ways, art becomes more real 

if it is allowed to leave.

Is art only real if it fits the 
(ethnocentric) narrative?

Dr. Lisa Young, a lecturer in the 
archaeology 
and 
anthropology 
departments at the University 
of 
Michigan, 
challenges 
that 
assumption in a course she teaches 
called 
“Frauds 
and 
Fantastic 
Claims in Archeology.”
For part of the course, Young 
covers the history of the Michigan 
Relics: a group of tablets found 
in central Michigan and falsely 
attributed 
to 
pre-Columbian 
visitors to the Americas due to the 
imitation cuneiform inscribed in 
them. When teaching this story 
of how several political, religious 
and economic elites made absurd 
attempts to pass off these fraudulent 
artifacts as evidence of untold 
Old World influences on Native 
American 
civilizations, 
Young 
stresses what is at stake when those 
with the power to declare what is 
real and what is fake wield their 
power irresponsibly.
Specifically, 
the 
purported 
existence of these tablets were 
weaponized in favor of what 
Young identified as “the myth of 
the mound builders: (That) these 
mounds could not have been built 
by Native Americans,” referring 
to the monumental landforms left 
behind by Native American tribes 
in Midwestern states.
Young went on to explain 
the political reverberations of 
such denials of authenticity to 
Native 
American 
civilizational 
achievement: “You can see how 
that can really start to become a 
narrative, which it did, to deny 
native people their traditional 
homelands.” In fact, she pointed 
out that Andrew Jackson invoked 
the Michigan Relics “in a speech 
to Congress in 1830 to justify 
why Native Americans should 

be removed off their traditional 
homelands and shipped out to 
Oklahoma.” Because they were not 
allowed to lay claim to real art — 
“Because they’re just in the way.”
Of course, in the case of the 
Michigan Relics, we’re talking 
about archaeological objects, but 
as Young herself warned, there 
are various parallels outside of 

the archaeological sphere. In the 
discussion section of her class, 
students examine knockoffs of 
brand names. The resonance of 
this archaeological conflict over the 
facts with contemporary trends of 
political debate and “fake news” are 
addressed.
It makes you rethink the weight 
of the accusation of fraudulence, 
even when levied against a work 
of art. It reminds you: There is an 
artist behind that work of art that 
you’re disenfranchising.

Is art only real if it’s the 
“original”? 
(Resisting 
the 
ethnocentric 
narrative, 
part 
two).

Dr. Natsu Oyobe is a curator 
of Asian art at the University of 
Michigan Museum of Art. As a 
curator, she falls into the camp that 
the DIA’s Jillian Reese identified 
as the staunchest defenders of 
art’s rightful place being inside 
the museum. Oyobe has a distinct, 
refreshing take on what counts as 
“real” and “fake” in the world of 
fine art.
“Copying is a really important 
sort of training and mastering,” 
followed by interpretation and 
the creation of “something of your 
own,” in the East Asian tradition, 
Oyobe explained. She added that 
in response to nineteenth century 
Western influences, “the idea of 
copying really is tarnished in a 
way. Because of that Western idea 
(that the original has the) only true 
authenticity. That’s something that 
also embedded into the minds of 
Asians as well.”
Oyobe 
will 
confront 
these 
conflicting notions of authenticity 
in an upcoming UMMA exhibition 
she is curating. Called “Copying 
and Creativity in East Asia,” 
Oyobe’s exhibition will showcase 
art that prizes imitation, like 
that of the Chinese and Japanese 
literati painters. “The way they 
create their own work is to first 
copy brushstrokes of the masters 
who came before them,” Oyobe 
explained. “You have to have 
knowledge. If you paint this way, 
that really refers to this painter in 
the fifteenth century.”
Through her exhibition, which 
will open Aug. 17, 2019 in the 
Taubman I Gallery at the UMMA, 
Oyobe seeks to “argue against that 
kind of binary,” which arbitrarily 
sets 
imitations 
at 
odds 
with 
originals.

Does art become real when we 
build a relationship with it?

I’m circling back to Youn, 
and I’m taking some of Oyobe’s 
wisdom with me. Both women have 
refreshingly radical conceptions of 
what makes art real, though they 
approach it from two very different 

angles. I think their unexpected 
harmony is where the answer 
to my initial inquiry may lie, the 
answer to my question of whether 
believing art should exist outside 
of a museum makes you an enemy 
of art.
Youn says, “The policemen … 
stand whispering/in the galleries: 
‘ … but what does it all mean?’ / 
Someone has the answers, someone 
who, grasping the frame, / saw 
his sun-red face reflected in that 
familiar boiling sky.”
Oyobe said, “Sometimes the 
donor or collector who owns 
objects comes to us and says they 
want to donate these pieces, or 
they have these art objects but they 
don’t know anything about this.” 
And they ask Oyobe, “Would you 
tell me what this is?” She told me 
she often screens these inquiries 
and often has to be the one to 
disappoint them. “But I always say 
that, if you like this reproduction,” 
she added, “I think that really 
becomes authentic to that person.” 
She said, “If you love that piece,” 
then that inscribes the work with 
authenticity all the same.
And I say: The answer to my 
opening question is no. No, none of 
us are in enmity with art. Museums 
provide a beautiful home for 
artwork. They pay homage to the 
complexity of art, the individuality 
and collectivity of art objects. The 
DIA, UMMA and numerous other 
museums are on the front lines of 
affirming the value and meaning 
of art. But they are not keepers 
of that meaning and they are not 
what makes art real. We make art 
real. Think about it: Could it exist 
without you? Without your eyes 
upon it? Without your body in 
front of it? Receiving its message, 
interfering with it, making it 
dynamic and communicative and 
rich and resonant?
That is why I want osmotic 
art. I want art that can be rained 
upon. I want art that subverts 
the 
norms. 
Perhaps 
all 
this 
concentrated thought and talk has 
made me sentimental, but I want 
art that becomes real when I have a 
relationship with it, the way a child 
wants a toy that becomes real once 
they love it.
I want to be someone who “has 
the answers,” to see my own face 
reflected in a work of art. And I don’t 
want to have to steal art in order to 
experience that. I don’t want to be 
told my experience with a work of 
art is fake. I want people like Jillian 
Reese, Lisa Young and Natsu Oyobe 
at the helm, expanding our notion 
of what makes a work of art real. 
I want to escape the unnecessary 
antitheses set up between what’s 
“real” and what’s “reproduced,” 
and I want to focus instead on 
the reality of the meanings we 
construct when we take it all in.
Don’t you?

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘UNEMPLOYED’

Tierra 
Whack 
is 
a 
multifaceted 
rapper 
and 
R&B artist. Her many hues 
are established not only by 
her bright-colored, evocative 
style, but also by her ability 
to take on multiple personas 
across her creative work. 
Inspired originally by the 
immersive 
worlds 
of 
Dr. 
Seuss, Whack established her 
ability to take on different 
personalities with her debut 
album Whack World, released 
in 2018. The album consists 
of fifteen tracks, each only 
one minute in length. It’s 
considered both an auditory 
and visual project, as it’s 
paired with a 15 minute 
music video that visualizes 
its scenes entirely.
Whack’s 
most 
recent 
single, 
“Unemployed,” 
epitomizes her keen sense 
of blending visual art with 

her sound — the vividly-
colored, couch-potato cover 
art serves as a manifestation 
of her enemies who can’t 
match 
her 
clout. 
Whack 
disses challengers with her 
characteristic 
satire 
and 
eccentric 
style, 
perfectly 
weaving the connotations of 

her cover art through each 
lyric: 
“You’re 
overweight, 
you ate a soda (Yo) / I’m 
super sober, you doin’ coke 
(Yo) / Coca-Cola (Yo, yo).”
Building on the success of 
her debut, Whack continues 
to establish herself as the 

queen 
of 
idiosyncratic 
formatting. Since Feb. 19, she 
has released five singles — one 
per week — that all fall under 
the umbrella of what she 
titles #WhackHistoryMonth.
With 
“Unemployed,” 
Whack continues to trailblaze 
a path for unconventional rap 
and the creative expression of 
women in the contemporary 
rap space. Her recent merch 
design, which is a play on 
her last name, encompasses 
her approach quite perfectly: 
Weird Hype And Creative 
Kids. Whack is on the come-
up, and she’s changing the 
norms for female rappers. 
Sit back, and watch Tierra 
Whack take her throne.
