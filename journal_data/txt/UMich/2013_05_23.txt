Wolverines fall in Big Ten Tournament opener

By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan baseball team
wasn't supposed to make the Big
Ten Tournament this season. After
all, it was a rebuilding year.
But the Wolverines are in Min-
neapolis this week, the site of the
double-elimination conference
tournament, and even more unex-
pected circumstances came to light
at Target field Wednesday in Mich-
igan's 11-2 loss to Nebraska.
It was quite a surprise to watch
the Wolverines' offense go ice-cold
just four days after posting their
highest single-game run total, 19,
against the Cornhuskers to clinch a
spot in this very tournament.
Nebraska jumped out to a 4-0
lead after three innings, and
wouldn't concede a run until the
ninth. Throughout the game,
Michigan struggled to play sound
defense and the Wolverine hurlers
could hardly find the strike zone.
"We didn't take care of the base-
ball defensively, we didn't have

very many quality at-bats (and)
we gave up eight free passes," said
Michigan coach Erik Bakich. "We
have ourselves to blame today."
Senior right-hander James
Bourque got the start for Michi-
gan, but underperformed in com-
parison to his recent successful
outings, allowing five earned runs
off six hits in 4.1 innings.
"For me, I just didn't make the
big pitches when I needed to,"
Bourque said. "That cost me when
I put guys on. I think they saw
things a little hit better the second
and third time through the order."
Behind Bourque, the Wolver-
ines' defense had one of its worst
games this season as it committed
four crucial errors. Those errors
led to three unearned Nebraska
runs, and with the cold bats, it
wasn't likely that Michigan could
muster a comeback.
Meanwhile, Nebraska's sopho-
more left-hander Kyle Kubat did
quite the opposite of Bourque in
his time on the mound. Michigan
saw Kubat in the first game of last

weekend's series, but the Wolver-
ines managed three runs off him
that time around. On Wednesday,
Kubat completely stymied Michi-
gan's bats, giving up only one hit
and striking out six in seven shut-
out innings.
"He's just one of those guys that
has really good command down in
the zone," Bakich said. "Me spots
his fastball. He certainly had a
good day."
Junior center fielder Michael
O'Neill had been on a tear heading
into the Big Ten Tournament, but
Kubat silenced him. O'Neill bat-
ted 0-for-4 Wednesday after going
5-for-14 with 6 RBI last week-
end. Senior second baseman Pat-
rick Biondi fared the best against
Kubat, but still, he couldn't manage
a hit while being walked twice.
After a paltry offensive and
defensive performance, the Wol-
verines will need to get back to
fundamentals if they hope to last
another day in the tournament.
Michigan will start either fresh-
man left-hander Evan Hill or

First ever
upgrades to
'U' center
since 19'71
$1.5 million worth
of renovations to
increase safety and
outward appearance
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily Staff Reporter
The Power Center for the Per-
forming Arts opened during former
president Richard Nixon's adminis-
tration, and since the performance
space raised its curtains 42 years ago,
it hasn't had a major renovation since.
However, that's about to change
as a $1.5 million renovation will
update the Power Center's life
safety and aesthetic features.
Barry LaRue, the senior perfor-
mance hall operations manager,
said the Power Center was the
premier theatrical venue for the
School of Music, Theatre & Dance.
"There was a general feeling
that the theatre had slipped a bit in
terms of its finishes," LaRue said.
The renovations include an
array of safety updates: additional
handrails and lighting, back-of-
house safety features and increased
wheelchair-accessible options.
LaRue said there are currently
handrails on only one side of the
steep aisles in the Power Center.
Lighting on the steps in the lobby's
spiral staircase, he added, is not as
strong as it ought to be.

Construction on
new structure to
begin June 13th
By LEWAA BAHMAD
For the Daily
Residents of Ann Arbor's Wall
Street neighborhood met with
University officials Wednesday
to discuss the controversial con-
struction of a new parking struc-
ture in the neighborhood.
The planned brick and concrete
structure aims to add 500 more
parking spaces as well as spaces
for motorcycles and bicycles to
accommodate for the growth of
the University Health System.
Residents are upset with the
project and argue the expansion
would pollute the neighborhood,

increase traffic and threaten the
safety of pedestrians.
University Planner Sue Gott,
and James Kosteva, the Univer-
sity's director of community rela-
tions, led the meeting and spoke
on behalf of the University at the
community meeting held at the
Brehm Center on Wall Street.
"This is agroup we've met with
for a number of years," Gott said
before the meeting. "I'm sure it
will be constructive."
The parkingstructure is meant
to serve as a satellite structure to
the University Hospital. Hospital
employees will have to park in
the structure and take a shuttle
to the hospital, which requires
the construction of a waiting
station for the bus service. Con-
struction will begin June 13th
and the structure will be com-
pleted in the spring of 2014.

The plans for the parking
structure were initially proposed
in 2008 but were postponed after
the city of Ann Arbor agreed to
a joint effort with the University
to construct a parking structure
on Fuller Road instead. Since
then, the University dropped the
Fuller Road plans in favor of the
Wall Street parking structure as
a result of the city's inability to
hold up its portion of the fund-
ing.
While the University has said
the construction of the struc-
ture is definite, residents are
adamant about expressing their
contentions with it. The residents
expressed positive comments
about the increased level of com-
munication and claimed the Uni-
versity has been more open about
the project than it was in 2008.

Regents approve
four agenda items

MARLENE LACASSE/Daily
University Provost Martha Pollack recommends James Hilton to assume
the role of Dean of Libraries at the Board of Regent's meeting.
Hilton named
Dean of Libraries

Former interim
librarian to continue
digitization process
By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
Daily Staff Reporter
DEARBORN - The University's
Board of Regents convened
Thursday at the University's
Dearborn campus to review a
selection of infrastructure and
personnel changes. Among these
items was the appointment of
information prof. James L. Hilton
as the dean of libraries
As vice president and chief infor-
mation officer of the University of
Virginia, Hilton continued to serve
roles atthe Universitythat included
special assistant to the provost for
media rights, associate provost for
academic information and instruc-
tional technology affairs and inter-
im University librarian. Hilton has
signed on to a five-year agreement.
University Spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said Hilton's previous
involvements with the creation of
HathiTrust and other University
library endeavors made him a good
fit to administer to the libraries.
"It's something that he is deep-
ly involved in," Fitzgerald said.
"Everyone seems confident that he
was the right person to continue to
lead the library."
The University Library is cur-
rently undergoing massive chang-
es, as hardcopies of texts are being
digitized and archived. Hilton said
in a University press release that he
would continue to foster this tran-
sition through his role.

"I am thrilled to be returning to
U-M at a critical time in the evolu-
tion of the University library," Hil-
ton said in the release. "Michigan is
a leader in digital information and I
am honored to join the team."
University Provost Martha Pol-
lack recommended Hilton to the
position and reaffirmed that Hilton's
commitment to the libraries would
be crucial to their development.
"As dean of libraries and uni-
versity librarian, James' vision
and leadership will be essential to
our ability to address the changing
nature of information acquisition
and knowledge dissemination,"
Pollack said in communication
with the regents. "He will contrib-
ute to the study and design of infor-
mation access and preservation."
While digitization will continue
to require alarge share ofthe librar-
ies' time and resources, Fitzgerald
said it was too early to tell if any
other changes will come about as a
result of Hilton's appointment.
"I'm sure we'll see (digitization)
continue but where the future may
lead, that will be up to experts
like (Hilton) to lead that way,"
Fitzgerald said. "To make sure that
documents are available for future
generations has always been a
priority and I know it will continue
tobeapriority."
Hiltonwill succeed Public Policy
prof. Paul Courant, who assumed
the role of dean of libraries and
University librarian in 2007.
Fitzgerald said Courant
stepping down from the position
was not an abnormality at the
University, as a five-year term was
typical of most director and dean
positions.

Field hockey complex
receives funds,
general admission
policy discussed
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
ManagingNews Editor
DEARBORN - At this month's
meetingofthe University's Board
of Regents, the regents heard
from Business senior Michael
Proppe, president of the Central
Student Government, and
approved multiple construction
and renovation projects and
faculty appointments.
Proppe first addressed the
regents and expressed his disap-
pointment with the newly intro-
duced general admission policy
for football seating in the fall.
He said many students would
never be able to fulfill their
dreams of sitting in the front
row for football games, even
during their senior year when
they would have been able to -
under the previous policy - get
season tickets near the field.
"I wish the first step would
have been to go to the students,"
Proppe said.
CSG has passed a resolution
condemning the policy shift
although CSG will not actively
work to reverse the policy.
Instead CSG will advocate for
student input in future policy
decisions that affect students
similarly.
Rackham student Nils
Hennes-Stear, a CSG
representative, echoed Proppe's
dissatisfaction with the new
seating policy in a tweet sent out
during the meeting.
"When is failing to consult
those most affected by a decision
ever a good policy?!" Hennes-
Stear tweeted.
During the second order of
business, 147 professors from the
University's Ann Arbor campus
received tenure. Three of those
professors spoke to the regents
about the research they have
been conducting at the Univer-
sity.
The regents then approved
the construction of a new field
hockey stadium and team

center, upgrades to Phyllis Ocker
Field and the installation of
new synthetic turf - as well as
other minor upgrades - on the
baseball and softball fields.
The field hockey complex will
cost $13.5 million and will be
funded entirely from donations
to the University Athletic
Department. It will include a
new grandstand able to seat
1,500 spectators and will have
multiple amenities, including a
new locker room and training
facilities.
The improvements to the
baseball and softball complex
will include the installation
of synthetic turf and minor
improvements to the grounds,
including upgrades to the fences
and sidewalks. The project
will cost $2.55 million and will
be funded through Athletic
Department resources.
In an interview with Mgoblue.
com, Athletic Director Dave
Brandon said he was excited
about these new projects.
"We are appreciative of the
donor support for both of these
projects," Brandon said. "The
two projects are part of our
department's strategic initia-
tive to build a connected athletic
campus that will unify all 31
teams."
Finally, the regents approved
the implementation of the new
Master of Management graduate
program in the Ross School of
Business.
The program intends to
provide a business degree for
students from a non-business
background.

If you were to ask any of the
No. 10 Michigan women's tennis
players what they would be doing
Saturday morning at 1:30 a.m.,
the answer would. be unanimous:
sleeping.
Instead, the Wolverines were
playing the No. 7 UCLA women's
tennis team in their Sweet 16
matchup - a match that started
around four hours late. And the
delay ultimately proved too much
to overcome, as Michigan fell
4-0 on Friday night and Saturday
morning.
The Wolverines started the
highly anticipated match at 11:00
pm central time in Urbana, Ill. and
did not finish until the wee hours
of the morning. After giving up a
tightly contested doubles point,
UCLA (19-5) cruised behind its
strongsingles play.
"It was a very difficult day," said
Michigan coach Ronni Bernstein.
"You have to figure out when to eat
and hit, and we started over four
hours late. I didn't want them sit-
ting around the hotel all day, and
we tried to get them moving, while
making sure they had enough food
in them. It was just unusual cir-
cumstances. It was tough for us,
but for UCLA as well."
For Michigan (10-1 Big Ten, 23-6
overall), winningthe doubles point
has been the key to success. Enter-
ing Friday's dual, the Wolverines

were undefeated when winningthe
point, and just 3-5 without it. The
point becomes even more crucial
when an opposing team boasts a
strong singles lineup - something
that has carried UCLA all season.
The Bruins have five nationally
ranked singles players - two in the
Top 20.
Michigan got down early at
the third spot, putting more pres-
sure on the first and second pairs.
After eventually losing at No. 3,
the Wolverines looked to their top-
pair of sophomore Emina Bektas
and junior Brooke Bolender. The
nation's sixth-ranked duo has been
a force to be reckoned with.
Bektas and Bolender, perhaps
the most aggressive team in the
nation, served and volleyed their
way to a 8-6 victory, evening up
the doubles score and putting the
doubles point in the second match's
hands.
Sophomore Sarah Lee and
senior Mimi Nguyen have found
success as an unconventional pair,
with Lee hitting a big ball, while
Nguyen is more of a crafty player.
The duo jumped out to a 5-2 lead,
but went on to give up two breaks.
All tied up at 6-6, with Lee serving,
the pair couldn't close out the game
after going to three deuce points.
Down 7-6, the Michigan pair broke
back, but couldn't hold serve once
again. UCLA served out the match,
giving the-Bruins the highly cov-
eted doubles point.
"We had a good start at num-

Wolverines falter against UCLA in Sweet 16

ber two, and I thought the UCLA
was struggling big time," Ber-
nstein said. "When you have a
UCLA team down, you have to
close them out. Getting that dou-
bles point would have been huge
momentum wise and we let it get
away from us. We had chances,
but couldn't do it."
The Wolverines entered singles
play well aware of the singles line-
up the Bruins boasted. But no one
knew better than Bektas, set to
play No. 3 Robin Anderson. Bektas
knew in order to be successful she
would have to exploit Anderson by
strong first serves, and put away
volleys, but against Anderson, it's
much easier said than done.

Anderson's shots were falling,
often times passing Bektas at the
net, ultimately winning, 6-3, 6-4.
"I don't think she made enough
first serves, and that's huge for
her game, especially against a
kid like Robin, who makes good
returns and is quick," Bernstein
said. "Emina needed to have a
better first serve percentage, and
she couldn't do it. She almost had
an easier time breaking, which is
unusual."
The Wolverines also lost at the
sixth and second spots to give
UCLA the match victory.
Despite the loss, Coach Bern-
stein made it clear that she is proud
of this team and that the future

remains bright.
"It's obviously disappointing
losing in the Sweet 16, but we had
another great season," Bernstein
said. "There is a lot of success to be
seen. We have a great base return-
ing, with three new kids coming
next year. We just have to stay
healthy and improve our doubles.
Overall it was a great year, and we
have to look into the positives of
that."
But for three Wolverines, the
season is not yet over. Bektas and
Bolender earned a 5-8 seed in the
NCAA doubles Championships,
while Bektas and freshman Ronit
Yurovsky earned invites to the
NCAA singles Championships.

Non-conference foes highlight hockey schedule

By GREG GARNO
ManagingSportsEditor
The Michigan hockey team's
first year in the newly formed
Big Ten Conference may be high-
lighted by its non-conference
schedule.
The Wolverines will host
perennial powerhouse Boston
College in their first regular-
season game of the year on Oct.
10 before travelling to Roches-
ter, N.Y. two days later to play
RIT. Michigan will also visit
New Hampshire the following
weekend before it returns home
to host Boston University and

Massachusetts-Lowell. A trip to
Nebraska-Omaha will round out
the non-conference road trips.
This year's Great Lakes Invita-
tional in December will include
the Wolverines, Michigan State,
Western Michigan and Michigan
Tech, and is scheduled to take
place in Comerica Park, home of
Major League Baseball's Detroit
Tigers. Last year's event was
moved across the Motor City from
Comerica Park to Joe Louis Arena
after the National Hockey League
cancelled the Winter Classic as a
result of a labor dispute.
Michigan will start Big Ten
play on Nov. 29 when its hosts

Ohio State. The Wolverines will
play two home-and-home series
with the Buckeyes this year.
After its senior night was held
during spring break in 2012,
Michigan will conclude the regu-
lar season on March 15 against
Minnesota, with students back in
school.
The Wolverines will play on
the road twice and at home twice
against each Big Ten school -
including their first-ever trip to
State College, Pa., where they
will play Penn State. The Big Ten
season will conclude with the Big
Ten Championships in Minneap-
olis, Minn. - also the site of the

NCAA West Regional.
"In all honesty this might be
the most exciting schedule I've
ever seen," said junior forward
Alex Guptill on Twitter." "If this

I don't know what would #BIG"
Michigan looks to return to

UMTRI announces
construction of new
research center
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
Last week was busy for the
University's Transportation
Research Institute, which
announced the creation of the
MichiganMobilityTransformation
Center in the midst of its three-
day long symposium on connected
vehicles and infrastructure.
The conference discussed a
wide range of topics, including
the environment, mass transit,
energy and other issues involved
in making cars and the streets they
drive on safer, more efficient and
more practical.
Francine Romine, UMTRI's
director of marketing and com-
munications, said the event, held
at the Rackham Graduate School,
was incredibly productive.
"The conference was an amazing
success. We had over 200 people
from around the world that came
together to talk specifically about
connected vehicle and infrastruc-
ture technology," Romine said.
Stephen Forrest,the University's
vice president for research, said
the MTC will engage with students
from all kinds of educational
backgrounds.
"It stretches all the way from
information technology, energy
technology to policy and so on,"
Forrest said. "It's very, very
interdisciplinary and we expect to
have lots of students working on
the research projects that will be
coming out of the center."
Forrest said a hypothetical proj-

ect of the MTC could be develop-
ing a system to actively reroute
drivers to less trafficked routes.
Such a program would require
information from cars and streets
to be shared in real-time, but could
potentially reduce time spent in
traffic, make driving more efficient
and driving conditions safer.
Forrest added that the historical
dominance that Michigan,
particularly in the southeast, has
had in the automobile business.
The ideas and potential changes
that accompany connected
vehicles and infrastructure can
substantially change a system that
has existed for roughly the past
century, and this is an opportunity
to take charge in pursuing the
future of transportation.
About 140 people, including
staff and researchers, work at the
UMTRI with anywhere from 15
to 30 students working there as
well, depending on the semester.
Romine said the institute also
works with students from the Col-
lege of Engineering, the Taubman
College of Architecture and Urban
Planning and other schools and
colleges on specific projects.
Despite the more than 100
students and staff working within
UMTRI, and the importance of the
work it produces, Romine noted its
low profile, which she attributed to
its nondescript locale, tucked away
on North Campus.
"We sit over on Baxter Road in
this 1960s-era poured concrete
building and I don't think most
people know that some of the
most significant milestones in
transportation safety have come
out of here," she said, noting that
the UMTRI's research excellence
spans back to its 1960s seatbelt
research.

season as one of the Wolverines'
most reliable presences on the
field. Driesenga won 29 of 35
decisions with a 1.69 ERA. She
recorded 221 strikeouts in 226
innings pitched, including 23
complete games and seven shut-
outs - a year worth a second
first-team all-Big Ten honor and
one that put the ball in her hand
come playoffs.
Headed into the Big Ten tour-
nament, the question of who to
start in each single-game match-
up was still in the air, according
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins.
"Both of those girls are capable
of greatness, so I expect both of
them to pitch," Hutchins said.
"We don't have a set starter. At
game time, that's who we're going
with."
In the first inning of the Big
Ten tournament semifinal against
Wisconsin, Wagner allowed two
runs before loading the bases. A
home run to a Badger's pinch hit-

ter put the Wolverines in a 6-0
hole, effectively sealing a loss and
an early trip home from Lincoln,
Neb. Wagner was relieved by Dri-
esenga after the first inning.
It seems it was an inning
Hutchins has not yet forgotten.
Wagner has not stepped on the
field since.
Driesenga started all bthree
games of the regional final last
weekend, pitching 21 consecutive
innings and two straight match-
ups with No. 18 California. The
right-hander struck out 19 and
threw two shutouts in the week-
end en route to a super regional
berth for the Wolverines.
"We battled through it and
again behind the effort of Sara
in particular on the mound,"
Hutchins said after Sunday's 3-1
victory over Cal. "And I didn't
think she had her best stuff, but
she had her heart and that was
the most important thing we
needed. She was determined to
get it done."
Driesenga is expected to be the
starter on Friday when the Wol-
verines take on No. 21 Louisiana-
Laffayette in the best-of-three
super regional. In her first start

against the Ragin' Cajuns, Dri-
esenga pitched a complete game
and allowed one unearned run
in Michigan's 3-1 victory. As the
new-found star of the Michigan
defense, Driesenga may prove the
key in a potential first appearance
in the Women's College World
Series since 2005.

A University engineering proj-
ect has successfully demonstrated
the first polariton laser.
The laser is powered by
electricity, rather than light, and
has proven to be far more energy-
efficient than conventional lasers. It
has the potential to be used in areas
where lasers are currently housed
- including optical communication
for wired Internet. Because of
its ability to modulate, project
could make lasers useful in future
developments in the consumer
electronics field, a University press
release reported.
Engineering Prof. Pallab Bhat-
tacharya led a group of four stu-
dents working on the project. The
group has worked on the proj-
ect since September 2009, and
achieved their first successful test
in the summer of 2012 before pub-
lishing their paper in the fall.

"I think this is another
completely new kind of a coherent
light source with electric
injection," Bhattacharya said.
Bhattacharya discussed the
significance of the polariton laser,
saying the energy needed to power
the laser was "three orders of mag-
nitude lower than the conventional
laser." Though he's a "physicist at
heart," he hopes to see more engi-
neers get involved in the field to
achieve practical uses for the laser.
Although the laser cannot be
currently used for high power
applications, Bhattacharya said
there is a "multitude" of low
power applications, including
low power switches and low
power amplifiers, each requiring
a significantly lower input energy
than conventional lasers.
Bhattacharya explained that
the polariton laser is so efficient
because it requires a fewer number
of polaritons, and they are all able to
occupythesame energystate,called
degeneracy, takingup less room.
"Imagine in the football
stadium: As people come in, let's

they can all fit in the lowest level."
These grouped polaritons
then form a condensate, which is
coherent and emits coherent light
like a laser, Bhattacharya added.
The project reached its major
breakthrough with the implemen-
tation of a magnetic field, which
allowed the laser to work properly.
Rackham student Allan Xiao,
one of the students working on
the project, said even though the
laser is in its "infancy stage," it's
still a significant breakthrough in
laser technology.
"Although our device is only a
prototype which requires some
external means such as low
temperature and an external
magnetic field to help it operate it
is the first polariton laser that does
not require optical pumping with
another laser," Xiao said.
Both Bhattacharya and
Xiao said though it's currently
hard to tell the exact future
implications of the polariton laser,
it has reinvigorated the previously
stagnant field.

Press espionage
Records seizure deserves Congressional attention
L ast week, the Department of Justice notified The Associated
Press of the government's seizure of two months' worth of phone
records from editors and reporters. The government seized
the phone records to find the source of a leak of information about the
CIA's disruption of a Yemen-based terrorist plot to bomb an airliner last
year. Regardless of the perceived threat to national security, the Obama
administration should respect the press's prerogative to report on gov-
ernment. If the administration cannot perform this check on itself, then
Congress should hold the administration accountable.

have to dive into house music head-
first. The sixth track "Lose Yourself
to Dance" is the obvitus evolution
from the grooving hit: Pharrell
similarly croons over funky guitars,
imploring us with its titular mes-
sage. "I know your life is speeding
and it isn't stopping/ Here, take my
shirt and just go ahead and wipe up
all the / Sweat, sweat, sweat." Like
Pharrell needed any help playing
the disco stud.
And when it comes to dancing,
RAM has got you covered. The intro
"Give Life Back to Music" might
just be a mission statement to the
power of danceability, while "Frag-
:O LUMBIA ments of Time" is subtle and under-
stated - and yet infectious enough
to already imagine the remix pos-
sibilities .
Amazingly enough, though,
RAM isn't a dance album - or at
least, doesn't even seem wholly

call on that asa sign that Daft Punk

serving as a suitable climax for
the record at large. And anyone
with some time to kill should try
to find a video of"Contact" synced
up with the final minutes of "2001

ly, the original source has been
deleted due to copyright viola-
tion (because clearly there was
so much profit to be made), but in
the meantime, another will likely
spring up (or you can try syncing
them yourself!).
In any case, Random Access
Memories succeeds asa Daft Punk
album more than a dance album
- and listeners should take care
to distinguish between the two.
Yes, there are opportunities to get
loose; "Lose Yourself to Dance"
and "Get Lucky" should see to
that. But as an entire work of art,
Random Access Memories devi-
ates from the usual house filler,
and Daft Punk provides even
more evidence that the duo is one
of the coolest, sleekest acts in the
galaxy.

TO THE DAILY:
Dear President Coleman,
I am a proud double graduate
of the University. I credit my
Michigan education with affording
me opportunities that relatively
few others in the world have and
with giving me an edge over many
of my colleagues. I received a
valuable education that has enabled
me to begin a career I love. Your
university empowered me to be
a confident and capable young
woman who thinks for herself.
Two weekends ago, I sat in the Big
House and watched my baby sister
graduate, and I couldn't be prouder.
I bleed maize and blue.
But as of May 16, I also could
not be more disgusted. That night,
I received a call from Michigan
Telefund. The young woman
on the other end was polite and
appropriate. We reached the point
in the conversation where she asked
me to donate. I said I wasn't quite
yet in a position to donate, but the
information you have on file for me
is correct. We chatted about lost
funding and budget cuts, and what

that means for scholarships. She
asked me two more times to donate.
Both times I said I would when I
was able. Then something utterly
disheartening happened: the young
lady on the other end of the phone
suggested that she could call me
back after I had a chance to ask my
husband about it. That's funny: as
far as I could tell, it was my phone
that rang and I who had answered.
If there's any organization in the
world that should truly understand
that I - along with every other
female Michigan graduate - am
capable of making my own decisions
and speaking for myself, it should
be yours. After my parents, my
boyfriend-turned-fiance-turned-
spouse and I paid your university
$141,466.32 to shape me into a con-
fident, capable, and self-sufficient
young woman, it would be much
appreciated if your organization
believed that a confident, capable
self-sufficient young woman is
exactly what I've become.

it started with the mysterious,
15-second ad during "SNL" way
back in March: Just a Daft Punk
logo, eclipsed by the fusion of the
two iconic helmets, and the sweet,
funky guitar chords that would
eventually define the single-to-be
"Get Lucky." Even then, there was
an air of something special - that
this wasn't just Daft Punk playing

the part of typical house juggernaut
releasing typical new music. No, if
the ad had anything to insinuate, it
was that Daft Punk's newest release
was something to be teased - the
harbinger of some momentous,
funky disco-pocalypse.
So when Pharrell's lofty vocals
propelled "Get Lucky" to "hit sin-
gle" status (with some already call-
ing it this summer's anthem), the
speculation over Random Access
Memories only skyrocketed. Would

Scandal' concludes an ambitious season

Records from more than 20
telephones belonging to the
AP's offices and its journalists -
including home and cell phone
records - were involved in the
DoJs seizure, which was done in
secret and without consent. In an
interview, AP CEO Gary Pruitt
expressed his outrage, calling
the government "secretive" and
noted "they've been overbroad
and abusive - so much so that,
taken together, they are uncon-
stitutional because they violate
our First Amendment rights."
Despite the fact that the DoJ was
searching for the source of the
leakage of information about the
foiled Yemen terrorist plot last
May, the government still does
not have the right to infringe
upon the freedom of the press.
The seizure of information
from the AP is not the only
time President Barack Obama's
administration has intruded
upon the freedom of the press.
The administration has pursued

six cases of information leakage
under the Espionage Act since the
beginning of Obama's first term.
This is in stark contrast to previous
presidents, where the act had been
used only three times in total. The
administration's overuse of the
act creates a dangerous precedent
for future relations between the
media and the government, and
it's not surprising that the press
and members of both parties have
spokenoutagainstthe DoJ'srecent
move. Given this disapproval
of the administration's actions,
Congress should now consider
amending the act to prevent
further intrusion into the press's
freedoms.
The sources the government
are seeking are confidential for
a reason - whistleblowers need
to be able to go to the press with
information without fearing
possible repercussions from the
government for doing so. The
government is not perfect, and
the freedom of the press ensures

that these imperfections don't
become buried in the bureau-
cracy. If this process works, the
public can hold the government
accountable and workto improve
it. However, without this flow of
information from the press, it's
extremely difficult for the public
to obtain knowledge of the gov-
ernment's affairs.
The AP phone records intru-
sion proves that the govern-
ment's treatment of the press
deserves more scrutiny than it's
currently receiving. The press
and its sources should not have
to fear secretive searches that
undermine the First Amend-
ment. It is now the duty of Con-
gress to protect the freedom of
the press, a process that should
include a thorough reevaluation
of the Espionage Act. If Con-
gress doesn't act in response to
this incident, more intrusions
against the press by the current
administration or future admin-
istrations are possible.,

Network television needs Olivia
Pope. The networks faced their
worst numbers ever this season,
and ithas become
basic knowledge
that if you want
daring, top-notch SCandal
television, you go
to cable. In this Season 2
state of decay, Finale
network TV could Thursdays
certainly use at10 p.m.
Olivia Pope, the A
spin-wizard atthe AlC
center of ABC's
"Scandal," drummingup good press
and changing its image. And in a
way, it does: As "Scandal" closes out
its second season, it's all the more
clear that Pope (Kerry Washing-
ton, "Peeples") and her universe are
glimmering signs that smart, risk-
taking drama can still be found on
network TV.
By undertaking an ambitious
season-long arc after its fun but
inconsistent first season, "Scandal"

made leaps and bounds to become
the cable-ready behemoth that it
is. The showrunner behind it all is
Shonda Rhimes, who knows a thing
or two about how to build a suc-
cessful show, having created net-
work megahits "Grey's Anatomy"
and "Private Practice." This sea-
son, Rhimes and her team of gladi-
ators in suits seem fearless in their
attempts to shock and seduce view-
ers with their explosion of a shot.
Rhimes has created an America run
by a megalomanic first lady, an Afri-
can-American fixer who's sleeping
with the president and a gay chief-
of-staff. In this world, presidents
are shot; presidents murder; former
spies attend Narcotics Anonymous
because they're addicted to slicing
people up and unlikely co-conspira-
tors riganational election. And it all
feels wonderfully over-the-top but
never silly.
Most importantly, it's TV you
shouldn't feel guilty about loving.
Sure, "Scandal" is undeniably a pri-
metime soap among a TV season of
sudsy indulgence, but it's got more
intelligence than "Nashville," more

stability than "Revenge" and more
life than "House of Cards." Only in
a brief stretch midseason did the
show lose some of its edge, getting
too wrapped up in its own conspira-
cies. And by the end, all the red her-
rings and suspense about who the
goddamn mole was went stale. But
by then, it didn't really matter much,
because the plot still touched each
and every character in different,
exciting ways.
Despite sprinkling in plenty of
soapy tropes, "Scandal" breaks
conventions and expectations. The
smartest move the show made was
letting its main character take off
her white hat; while the Olivia of
season one was hardly a saint, here,
she's wrapped up in a stolen presi-
dency, with plenty of blood on her
gloved fingertips. Fitz (Tony Gold-
wyn, "The Good Wife") - or Presi-
dent Grant, as he's referred to by
virtually no one - most strikingly
defies expectations. He's hardly the
powerful, clever leading man. If he
resembles any stock character at all,
it's a damsel in distress. His wife
Mellie (Bellamy Young, "Criminal

Minds"), his chief-of-staff Cyrus
(Jeff Perry, "Grey's Anatomy") and
his lover Olivia are basically always
telling him to go to the Oval Office
and play while the grownups figure
out how to fix the free world.
"Scandal" is loud, from its signa-
ture camera shutter sound effects
during scene transitions to its bold
story maneuvers. Its scripts burst
at the seams with dialogue, because
these characters have a whole lot
to say and they say it so damn well.
But unlike Aaron Sorkin's "The
Newsroom," where a bunch of white
dudes kept screaming about noth-
ing, every word these characters
utter - whether it be in one of the
many closeup shout-a-thons or in
a rare but potent whisper - drips
with meaning.
Washington is a clear stronghold
for the cast, but she's supported by
an army of fierce performers who
give life to the page. All season,
Perry knocks us out with his manic
energy, storming through tunnels,
huffing down halls as Fitz's bull-
dog Cyrus, finally reaching a boil-
ing point in the finale. Guillermo

Diaz does truly haunting work, with
semi-reformed killer Huck domi-
nating large stretches of narrative,
making the once mysterious charac-
ter the most fleshed-out and intrigu-
ing of all the gladiators.
Young mesmerizes as Mellie,
spewing out breakneck monologues
packed with twisted one-liners.
Even Goldwyn gets his chance to
wax poetic in the finale, explain-
ing to Mellie exactly how things
will work now that she has told the
American public about his affair.
Cyrus knows Fitz never could have
come up with something so genius
himself and asks if Olivia is behind
the masterplan ... of course she is,
Cyrus. There's no problem Olivia
can't fix, even when it's her own.
And yet, in the finale's final
moments, Olivia Pope is caught -
for possibly the first time in her life
- completely and totally off-guard.
with a twist that could very well
prove to be premise-altering.
Yes, network television indeed
needs Olivia Pope. It needs Shonda,4
Rhimes. And it needs "Scandal"
showingother dramas howit's done.

A
Star Trek:
Into Darkness
At Quality 16
and Rave
Paramount

G rl the back of yo head is ridiculous. PARAMOUNT
'oAbrams goes boldly
'Int Darkness'

To the end credits, "Darkness"
barrels through with unrelenting
adrenaline, pausing for only a few
brief moments and never spin-
ning out of control.
The longest lull comes when
the impossibly resilient Khan
spells out his Why-I'm-Evil story,
an action-flick convention even
novel screenwriters Roberto Orci
and Alex Kurtzman ("Star Trek")
can't avoid. As far as villain ori-
gins go, Khan's is pretty by-the-
numbers, and his motives lack
weight. But it's also a testament
to the film's frenetic energy that
even a brief soliloquy delivered
from the mesmerizing mouth
of Cumberbatch has us wishing
we'd just get back to the phaser-
slinging thrills. Motives matter
less when you're having so much
damn fun.
And "Darkness" knows how to
have fun. Instead of sticking to
the newfangled formula of deeply
emotional journeys and brood-
ing characters - made popular
by recent comic-book adaptations
- "Darkness" is a space adven-
ture ripped from the dreams of
any sci-fi geek. The film never
reaches the darkness its title sug-
gests, neither tonally nor aesthet-
ically. Themes of terrorism and
wartime moral instability trickle
throughout, and between deep
space base-jumping and hand-
to-hand combat with Klingons,
these characters do pause to con-
template mortality: The always
logical, stats-crunching Spock
divulges his feelings on death,
rendering lieutenant and linguis-
tics expert Uhura (Zoe Saldana,
"Avatar") speechless. But even
these pauses aren't dark; they
hum with human honesty and
evoke the large-hearted utopia-
nism that can be traced back to
"The Original Series."
And not only is it fun, it's sexy,
and not just because its cast is.
The visuals awe, even in 2-D, and

cinematographer Daniel Min-
del returns to capture a colorful
world, speckled with enough lens
flare to light even the darkest
corners of the universe, as can
be expected with Abrams at the
helm. And while it's a sexy space
adventure with Michael Bay-level
booms and brawls, it fortunately
lacks the sexed-up overindul-
gence that accompanies big Bay
features.
The closest the film comes to a.
traditional action movie romance
arc is between Kirk and Spock.
Sorry fangirls, that doesn't mean
there's a "Spirk" kiss. But the tra-
jectory of the friendship between
these two men, who couldn't be
more different - Kirk breaks rules
while Spock sticks to the book -
has been steadily built upon, with
Pine and Quinto playing it perfect-
ly from square one. Their back-and-
forth quips are some of the script's
highlights, though it's Simon Pegg
("Paul") as the outspoken, liquor-
slurping Enterprise engineer Scot-
ty who lands the most laughs.
Though it again nails the bal-
ance between nostalgia (Leonard
Nimoy reprises his cameo, and a
Tribble makes a brief, trouble-
less appearance) and reinvention,
stunning the Klingon-speaking
Trekkies and a new generation
of moviegoers alike, "Darkness"
doesn't possess the originality of
Abrams's first "Trek." The sequel
had to fulfill lofty expectations:
For one, it's a follow-up to what
was easily 2009's finest summer
blockbuster, but it's also a quasi-
remake of "The Wrath of Khan," a
fan-favorite film in the franchise.
Taking on such a huge enterprise
was, admittedly, highly illogical.
But Abrams calculates risk like
Kirk: the bolder, the better. And
even with a simple story and more
action than emotion, "Darkness"
boldly goes and does so at warp
speed, leaving you gasping for
breath.

t's a typical Tuesday night and
the line for Ann Arbor's home of
the damned - Scorekeepers Bar
and Grille - is out
the door. As you
wait in line you
might be wonder-
ing: Am I going
to get in? Are
we in the right
order? Who's here -
tonight? Do I look NATASHA
good? ERTZBISCHOFF
Ah-ha! There it
is - the last ques-
tion on your mind - do I look good?
As a girl, you know the reality is the
bouncer will only let you in if you're
lookin' fine. Let's be honest, you could
actually be 21 but if you're not dressed
in a short skirt and some scrap of cloth
that you're trying to pass off as a top,
you're not getting in. However, if you're
clad in 4-inch plus heels and a bodycon
dress you could pretty much hand the
bouncer a scrap of notebook paper that
says "I'm 21" and you're as good as gold.
Dress like a slut and the world - or
at least Scorekeepers - is your oyster.
That's the uglytruth. But when exactly
did we learn the Golden Rule: Thou
shalt wear low-cut tops?
Maybe it all started when we were
little girls dressed in tomboyish Gap
t-shirts watching our favorite Disney
princess movie through mascara-less
eyelashes. Now you might be thinking
yeah, okay, Snow White isn't exactly
your typical lady of the night with
her cap sleeves and kitten heels - but
hear me out. As aspiring princesses-in-
training we look to these cartoon idols
for advice on finding our happily ever
after - or at least I did. So maybe Snow
White doesn't seem like your typical
hussy but let's take a look at another
princess, say, Ariel. That girl is wearing
nothing but the cartoon version of the
Victoria's Secret Bombshell bra and -
well that's about it (mermaid tails don't
count). If you're still not convinced -
how about Cinderella? In the beginning
of the movie she's wearing matronly
brown garb - a covert sexist statement
about our domestic role in the house.
And with that blase spinster's outfit,
it's pretty clear that she's not attracting
anyone but birds and mice. Then as if
by magic (insert fairy godmother and
eye rolling) a sparkly low-cut dress and
some gaudy blue eye shadow, she bags
the man of her dreams. Bibbidi-bobbi-
di-boo, you've got yourself a success by
slut-ification story.
Somaybeweweretooyoungtoreally
understand the implicit demeaning
message that ol Walt was sending us
through our VCRs. But as we've gotten
older the media messages have become

more shamelessly explicit and - quite
frankly - disgusting. Take the 2008
romcom, "The House Bunny", where
Playboy bunny Shelly tries to teach
the frumpy-dump sorority girls of
Zeta Alpha Zeta how to attract frat
boys and save their house. And what
is the holy grail of being a successful
sorority girl? You guessed it! Dressing
like a slut. Shelly expertly advises
them that "dressing sexy is all about
skimplifying. I want you to show skin
in the four major regions. Arms, legs,
belly and cleavage." You heard it from
the Playboy bunny first - showing skin
equals happiness.
You can look at
this as a good or a
bad thing.
So now after you've done some deep
soul-searching on the origins of the
slutty outfit, here you are, back in the
line at Scorekeepers, trying to channel
all your good karma into getting past
the gatekeeper (the bouncer with
a smug Cheshire grin on his face).
Thankfully, even though you look like
you're 12 and your fake ID is a piece
of shit, you remembered to wear that
mesh cut-out Nasty Gal dress you've
been saving for such an occasion.
*Cue the trumpets and angelic
music* You got in!
So, you can choose to look at this
blatant disregard for the law and the
linear relationship between skin expo-
sure and male attention involved as a
really good thing or a really bad thing.
I like to look at it as a damn good
thing because it means that as women
we hold all the cards. There will always
be some men that ogle women and
appreciate them at legs to chest - then
at face value. Some things you just
can't change. Now I'm not saying that
as a girl you should walk around with
a tit hanging out in order to get what
you want - that would be borderline
prostitution. But what I'm saying is
that as strong, beautiful women of the
21st century it's our prerogative when
it comes to how we want others to
perceive us. It's pretty empowering to
feel comfortable with your own body
and dress how you please.
Maybe we really should follow
Beyonce's advice: if you've got it, flaunt
it. So screw boys and let's just dance.

half of my
junior year
studying
abroad.
During the
past three or
so months
I've surfed
the other
side of the
Atlantic
in Lagos,
Portugal,

dismissively stared right back
at Mona in The Louvre in Paris,
inadvertently offended a man of
the cloth in Italy and recreated
my favorite scenes from the film
"In Bruges," well, in Bruges.
And all that was just one week.
Like all good things, those
antics eventually ended and I
returned home, trading gela-
to for frozen Go-Gurts, lav-
ish Italian first, second and
third courses for Chipotle and
renaissance art for Adult Swim.
The end to my time abroad hap-
pened to coincide with the end
of winter semester and as my
Facebook newsfeed overflowed
with the laments of graduat-
ing seniors, I dwelled on the
juxtaposition of the two expe-
riences. What about Michigan
had influenced these seniors
so profoundly? Had I missed
out on that by studying abroad?
And if so, had my time abroad
changed me?
After dwelling on the
question and a quick phone
call to my mom asking why
Facebook statuses affected
me so much (she said maybe it
was that time of the month, I
told her wrong kid), I arrived
at a simple - if not peculiar
- solution: that Michigan
Difference we always speak so
highly of - which permeates
through all our daily activities
like Doritos Locos Tacos
through the colon of a frat star
- is built upon a foundational
acceptance of what I call "the
weirdness." Furthermore, it
was because of the ways I had

Italy to spend the latter

accepted this weirdness as
a student that despite living
halfway across the world from
Ann Arbor, it still played a
significant role in shaping my
time abroad.
Now this weirdness is impos-
sible to precisely define. The
weirdness exists between
acceptance and dismissal - the
figurative hand that quite lit-
erally pushes your envelope.
The weirdness comes in any
shape, form or goo and includes
the strange meat I continually
accepted from a tattooed Italian
man in the sandwich shop next
door to my apartment in Flor-
ence to the occurrences at a typi-
cal poetry slam in Kerrytown.
Yet, this weirdness need not
deviate from the mainstream.
If the aforementioned activities
fail to strike you as peculiar then
a dabble into the weirdness may
entail actually washing your
hands after you go the bathroom
or attempting to stop trying so
hard to not look like you're not
trying to look cool, you damn
hipster. The point is weirdness
has no boundaries - it's a con-
tinual enigma and is simply that
which pushes you beyond your
comfort zone and forces you in
reflection to note "well shit, that
certainly was weird."
A continual cultivation of
the weirdness is necessary to
truly absorb any experience.
As any Wolverine can tell you,
the Michigan Difference is not
easily summarized - if at all.
It involves the prestige of our
school, but also going to class
blackout drunk on St. Patrick's
Day and confusing an under-
classman for a leprechaun. Foot-
ball pre-parties are a factor and
so is our work-hard, play-hard
attitude - name me one stu-
dent who hasn't had a professor
yet who so completely rocked
their intellectual foundation in
a good way, and I'll show you a
Michigan State student.
Our Michigan Difference
is defined by its inability to be
defined, existing upon a founda-
tion that celebrates any personal
endeavor, embracing the weird-

ness clad in gear from The M Den
with No Thai on its breath. The
best times I've had at Michigan
have been when I stepped out
of the confines of any defining
adjectives, attending non-Greek
life, Greek life and even Resi-
dential College parties, listening
to readings in the auditorium of
the University Art Museum or
getting to know the entirely too
old patrons of Scorekeepers Bar
and Grill.
The Michigan
Difference is in
the weirdness.
This acceptance of the
weirdness stayed with me
when I studied abroad, allow-
ing me to truly dive into a dif-
ferent culture uninhibited by
any fear of the unknown. I felt
bad for my peers who refused to
leave America behind - instead
constantly searching for Wi-Fi
while trying to pass Nutella
off as an excursion into foreign
cuisine. Because of the lessons
Ann Arbor taught me, I was
truly able to leave it behind.
I know I may sound like an
abomination hybrid of a car
commercial and Jim Carrey from
"Yes Man," telling you to grab
life by the horns and buy a Dodge
Ram - but the point is, that's
exactly what I want. Minus the
Dodge Ram part. For everyone,
from those who just graduated,
to those now completing
another chapter in their career
as a lifelong Wolverine, to those
just beginning their maize and
blue diary that I totally don't
have hidden under my bed - I
hope you never forget to always
carry with you that undeniable
and insatiable desire for the
weirdness that defines our
Michigan difference.

They were, however, disap-
pointed with the fact that there
was no general contractor pres-
ent at the meeting. Residents said
they desired a point of contact
with an official on-site so that
they could communicate about
expected grievances and com-

plaints when construction begins.
Residents said they were
alarmed by a number of poten-
tial problems with construction.
The chief concerns expressed at
the meeting were noise, air and
groundwater pollution, in addi-
tion to increased automotive con-
gestion and pedestrian safety.
Ann Arbor resident Rosemary
Sarri was also concerned about
the living quality of the area.

"This used to be a neighbor-
hood," Sarri said. "They wiped
it out."
Jim Koli, owner of Northside
Grill, echoed Sarri's comments,
saying that in the 19 years he has
owned his restaurant there have
been significant changes to the
neighborhood.
"The University is slowly buy-

"There used to be a vibrant

would have on the number of

University moves into an area
is that they are really Monday
through Friday, eight to five,"
Koli said. "The people who park
there are going to park and go."
Residents also pointed out that
there is an unnecessary volume
of automobiles.
"There's one person in a
car," Ann Arbor resident Eliana
Moya-Raggio said. "The hospital
needs to provide incentive to
drive together."
In order to limit noise and
vibrations, the construction
will employ drilling methods,
as opposed to pounding mecha-
nisms, for moving earth and con-
structing foundations. Electric
motors will be used to power
the site as opposed to less envi-
ronmentally friendly methods. A
full-time street sweeper will also
be deployed for dust control.
Air pollution will also be mini-
mized by spraying the site with
water and using a dust-collection
fabric on the fence surrounding
the construction. There will be
on-site, full-time traffic support
to the team in order to ensure
that there are no trucks idling on
the streets. The University is also
prepared to employ a "prepared
to fire" policy to ensure that con-
struction workers adhere to the
needs of the community.
"We've provided construc-
tion plans and are ready to start,"
Kosteva said. "We do expect this
to be utilized primarily by per-
sonnel working at the hospital
and medical center."

"This gives us a lot of momen-
tum," Bhattacharya said, "And
as we think of things, and so on,
I'm sure I'll come up with and
others will, with new applica-
tions, new device designs, all
kinds of things. We'll be improv-
ing on this every day."
Ayan Das, another Rack-
ham student in the Univer-
sity research group, also
emphasized that though other
groups borrowed the magnetic
field technique, the University
was the clear pioneer in the
polariton project. At the same
time, Das saw it as a form of
compliment, noting the signifi-
cance of having their ideas vali-
dated by other top researchers
using their techniques.

"It's an invitation to have a
bit of a fall," he said. "The reno-
vations will increase handrail-
ing units so both sides will have
something to grip (and) improve
aisle lighting so that steps are bet-
ter lit for patron safety."
Building codes have trans-
formed since the early '70s,
especially in consideration of
handicapped individuals, and
minor updates to theater seating
have been executed in the past
to ensure handicapped patrons
are accommodated. In this round
of renovations, LaRue said the
amount of wheelchair-accessible
seating will double.
Additionally, the bathrooms
and theater seating will be
renewed. The main lobby will be
repainted. The theater seats have
had the same upholstery since the
Power Center's inception over 40
years ago, LaRue said.
The architectural duo of Kevin
Roche and John Dinkeloo, who
designed the Power Center, have
separately worked on projects
such as the United Nations Plaza
and the redesigning of New York's
Central Park. LaRue said main-
taining the Power Center's design
prestige will be crucial during
renovations.
"What we very much are con-

scious of is trying to maintain the
original design ofthe buildingand
not marring that late '60s-early
'70s style," he said.
The renovations were approved
by the University Board of
Regents on May 16. The renova-
tions will be completed by the
spring of 2015 and will be phased
to minimize hindrances to the
performance season, a document
published by the board stated.
LaRue said the majority of
the work will be done during the
summer of 2014, when the Pwer
Center has the lowest number of
performances.
The SmithGroupJJR, a Detroit-
based architecture firm, was
hired to act as consultants a few
years ago to evaluate the Power
Center's needs, LaRue said. The
firm will also design the renova-
tion project.
LSA senior Tia Faraon has been
both a Power Center audience
member and a performer - she's
performed multiple times as a
member of the Filipino Student
Association. She said the Power
Center's backstage features and
lighting were professional.
"It's a really big stage and a big
venue," Faraon said. "It's exciting
to perform there."
She added that renovations
ought to consider the bathrooms
as well as the seating, as some
seats provide a fuller view of the
stage than others.

Ability to recognize
sadness might
help explain lower
depression rates.
By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily StaffReporter
If parents wantto keep their bad
moods to themselves, they'd better
start avoiding their kids. A study
performed by University research-
ers shows that children are even
more perceptive of their parents'
bad moods than originally believed.
A study entitled "Facial emo-
tion expression recognition
by children at familial risk for
depression" was published last
October by University researchers
Nestor L. Lopez-Duran and Kate
R. Kuhlman, and Charles George
and Maria Kovacs of the Univer-
sityofPittsburgh.
The study suggests that boys
whose parents suffer from depres-
sion recognize sadness more eas-
ily than low-risk boys, low-risk
girls and high-risk girls.
For this study, children were
identified as high risk if at least
one of their parents had been
diagnosed with depression. Kuhl-

man said the researchers wanted
to gain a sense of whether chil-
dren with depressed parents pro-
cess social information - in this
case, the emotions of others - dif-
ferently than other children.
"We wanted to examine if the
high and low-risk kids differed
in the level of intensity of facial
expression that they needed
before they could correctly identi-
fy the emotion," Lopez-Duran, an
assistant professor of psychology,
added in an e-mail interview.
The study analyzed data on 104
children, 64 of whom were high-
risk and 40of whom were low-risk.
As the children observed a pic-
ture of a neutral facial expression
morph into an expression of sad-
ness or anger, the study was able
to determine that high-risk boys
in particular were better able to
recognize sadness - but not anger
- in less intense facial expressions
than their low-risk peers.
The participants in this study
were followed for over 10 years,
and data was recorded over the
past two to three years, Lopez-
Duran said.
This study is part of a wider
research program being carried
out at the University of Pittsburgh
and lead by Dr. MariatKovacs, who
studies how depression devel-

ops and is passed along through
generations. The research aims
to understand why children with
depressed parents are more likely
to develop depression themselves
later in life.
Lopez-Duran said although the
study did not involve the collec-
tion of facial expression recogni-
tion of positive emotions she said
future studies could involve that.
Similarly, the study did not pre-
dict the participants' likelihood to
develop depression later in life as a
result of their ability to recognize
emotions
The study will follow the chil-
dren for years to come in order to
determine if a link between sensi-
tivity to sadness and risk of devel-
oping depression does in fact exist.
Kuhlman said the fact that
high-risk boys are better at rec-
ognizing sadness than girls might
partially explain why, generally,
boys have a lower risk of develop-
ingdepression than girls.
"Hopefully in the future, this
piece of the puzzle will con-
nect with other pieces that will
help us to improve our ability to
identify children at risk, provide
better preventive interventions
and develop better treatments
for affected children and adoles-
cents," Lopez-Duran said.
