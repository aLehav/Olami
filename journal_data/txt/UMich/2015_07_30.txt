Four Southeast 
Michigan colleges 

receive extra funding 

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

Michigan Sens. Debbie Stabe-

now and Gary Peters proposed 
this month that $1.1 million will be 
awarded to Southeast Michigan 
students to increase graduation 
rates. The plan is funded by the 
Department of Education’s TRIO 
Student Support Services Program, 
an outreach resource dedicated to 
assisting students from underprivi-
leged backgrounds.

Rachel McCleery, a spokesper-

son for Stabenow, said the Depart-
ment of Education selects schools 
to receive the program’s benefits, 
however, she added, the senators 
may also influence the selection 
process.

“Schools have in the past asked 

us to write letters of support and 
that kind of thing,” McCleery said.

Eligible students include those 

from low-income families, first 
generation college students, and 

students with disabilities.

The Wayne County Community 

College District will be receiving 
$388,500 of the plan’s funding, the 
largest cut of any other beneficiary. 
The second highest beneficiary is 
Siena Heights University in Adrian, 
which will be receiving $284,219.

The University of Detroit Mercy 

and Madonna University in Livonia 
will acquire $219,263 and $244,120, 
respectively.

These four schools are part of 

the more than 20 colleges in Michi-
gan that were selected this year to 
receive support from TRIO in the 
form of tutoring and financial aid 
planning. This grant is simply the 
latest attempt to boost college grad-
uation rates, specifically in South-
east Michigan.

In April, Sen. Stabenow intro-

duced the Early Pell Promise Act, 
which dedicates two years of Pell 
Grants, government funding for 
college students, to low-income 8th 
graders. Stabenow based the Prom-
ise Act on the Kalamazoo Promise, 
a program that provides complete 
tuition and fees for resident gradu-
ates of Kalamazoo Public Schools 
for four years at Michigan’s public 
universities and community col-

leges.

In a press release, Sen. Stabenow 

said students with good work ethics 
deserve the opportunity of a college 
education.

“Students who work hard and 

are accepted to college deserve 
every opportunity to succeed,” said 
Sen. Stabenow. “Thanks to today’s 
announcement, more college stu-
dents across Southeast Michigan 
will get tutoring, financial aid coun-
seling, and other support they need 
to finish school.”

Sen. Peters said in the press 

release the newest plan to provide 
extra assistance to Southeast Mich-
igan students will strengthen the 
state’s middle class.

“Whether it’s improving aca-

demic support services or increas-
ing financial resources, this support 
from the Department of Education 
will bolster efforts to retain and 
graduate more students in South-
east Michigan,” Sen. Peters said. 
“Higher education increases eco-
nomic opportunity and provides 
a pathway to the middle class, and 
putting the dream of completing 
a higher education degree within 
reach for more Michigan students 
is critical.”

Four city wards to 

hold primary elections 

Tuesday 

By LEA GIOTTO

Daily Summer News Editor

The primary election for seats 

on Ann Arbor’s City Council will 
take place on August 4th, with 
candidates from four of the city’s 
five wards – including wards 1, 3, 
4 and 5 — hoping to secure a seats 
for the next two years. While 
some candidates are currently 
sitting on council and seeking re-
election, others are new to Ann 
Arbor government, and here is 
what you need to know about all 
eight of them.

Ward 1: Sabra Briere (D) v. Will 

Leaf (D)

Briere is seeking re-election 

to City Council for what will be, 
if re-elected, her sixth term. She 
is a long-time member of the Ann 
Arbor community, having served 
in positions such as officer in the 
Washtenaw County Democratic 
Party and chair of the Ann Arbor 
City Democratic Party. 

She also spent a lot of time 

volunteering for organizations 
like the Huron River Watershed 
Council and the Natural Area 
Preservation/Parks.

Briere’s 
campaign 
agenda 

seeks to accomplish many proj-
ects, including: updating the 
city’s building and zoning laws, 
developing better transportation 
by spending more on sidewalks 
and roads, seeking more afford-
able 
housing, 
and 
increasing 

financial opportunities for local 
businesses.

The Grove on North 
Campus undergoes 
latest renovations 

$6.9 million project 
plans for volleball 

court, rain gardens and 

new walkways

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Summer Managing News Editor

Construction on North Campus 

is underway as renovations to The 
Eda U. Gerstacker Grove kick off 
near the North Campus Diag.

According to a statement from 

the College of Engineering, the 
goal of the project — named the 
Grove Project — is to transform 
the four-acre Gerstacker Grove 
into a space where students can 
linger and connect, making it a 
space comparable to that of the 
Diag on Central Campus.

Last 
week, 
the 
University 

Regents approved designs for the 
$6.9 million project design from 
Stoss, a Boston-based design firm. 
Renovations to the grove include 
new walkways, a paved plaza 
near the Ann and Robert H. Lurie 
Tower, and a sand volleyball court. 
The design also calls for an addi-
tional 180 trees with rain gardens.

In a statement, the Taubman 

College of Architecture and Urban 
Planning Dean Monica Ponce 
de Leon said the Grove Project’s 
unique design will help connect 
the engineering and architecture 
communities.

“The design of an interdisci-

plinary mixed-use outdoor space 
on North Campus brings U-M’s 
premiere arts, architecture and 
engineering communities togeth-
er in an unprecedented interac-
tive and visible way,” Ponce de 
Leon said. “Conceptualizing the 
existing space for new purposes 
will provide a venue for recre-
ation, exhibition and performance 
unlike any other on Michigan’s 
campus, creating a new destina-
tion for the arts and sciences.”

In an interview with the Daily, 

University planner Susan Gott 
said the project was first concep-
tualized during the creation of the 
2008 North Campus Master Plan, 
which calls for a series of renova-
tions across North Campus.

“As we were updating the mas-

ter plan for North Campus in 
between 2005 and 2008, we saw 
as part of the vision for North 
Campus the need and the oppor-
tunity for increased vitality and 
more destinations that would 
attract more University commu-
nity members to North Campus 
as a destination– activities and 
events that would be a reason to 
come and stay, and so the Grove 
was considered to be at the core 
and therefore an opportunity for 
a real iconic space on North Cam-
pus,” Gott said.

According to Gott, planners 

held a competition in 2007 called 
the WorkPlay competition, in 
order to solicit ideas from stu-
dents, faculty and staff on how to 
create a more interactive gather-
ing space at the Grove.

“There were two winning sub-

missions, and those winning sub-
missions were then integrated 
into what is the basic concept of 
the Grove,” she said. “Once we had 
the concept, we then hired a site 
designer to design it.”

Funding for the project was 

made possible through donations 
from the Rollin M. Gerstacker 
Foundation and other University 
donors.

According to Gott, construc-

tion workers have completed the 
demolition phase of the project, 
and are currently preparing the 
site with earthwork, utilities and 
underground work. Renovations 
to the Grove are scheduled for 
completion by fall 2015.

Overall, Gott said she is hopeful 

the renovations to the Grove will 
create an exciting destination on 
North Campus, as well as a home 
for students.

“Students that live and study 

there should think of this Grove as 
their home, and therefore a place 
that they will embrace,” Gott said.

low city council members, she is 

officially endorsed by the Huron Val-
ley Central Labor Council.

Although he’s not a newcomer to 

Ann Arbor, Briere’s opponent, Leaf, 
is new to City Council scene. Leaf 
has lived in Ann Arbor since 1993 
and, after graduating from the Uni-
versity, started his own mineral sun-
screen business that is based outside 
the city.

In terms of his experience with 

politics, in 2008 Leaf lobbied for 
a video privacy ordinance that, 
according to MLive, “would impose 
limitations on police surveillance of 
citizens.” Leaf also served as the co-
chairman of the short-lived Mixed 
Use Party, which advocated for more 
mixed-use zoning in the city.

If elected, Leaf pledges to do the 

following: increase road repair fund-
ing, create an annual bus pass avail-
able to all city residents, improve 
pedestrian safety by adding more 
barriers, medians and pedestrian-
activated stoplights and reform zon-
ing laws to preserve farmland and 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions in 
Ann Arbor.

Leaf is endorsed by former Ann 

Arbor 
City 
Attorney 
Elizabeth 

Schwartz and two local businesses — 
RoosRoast Coffee and Kaleidoscope 
Books and Collectibles.

John Roos, the owner of Roos-

Roast, said Leaf has the right mind-
set for a City Council representative.

“Will Leaf is a resident citizen of 

Ann Arbor and his outlook is well 
balanced for this city’s complex 
future,” Roos said.

Ward 3: Stephen Kunselman (D) v. 

Zachary Ackerman (D)

Like Briere, Kunselman is also up 

for re-election. He has represented 
Ward 3 on City Council for three 
terms. Since he got his start on coun-
cil in 2006, Kunselman’s accom-
plishments include leading the effort 
to stop the dissolution of the Ann 
Arbor Transportation Authority, 
reforming the Downtown Develop-
ment Authority and advocating for a 
skate park — which now exists — in 
the Ann Arbor.

If re-elected to the council, Kun-

selman promises to focus on the 
following: justly distributing the 
city’s financial resources, investing 
in infrastructure, providing more 
funding for parks and rebuilding the 
city’s public safety department.

Kunselman is endorsed by the 

Sierra Club, Michigan Chapter and 
the Sierra Club, Huron Valley Group. 
The club is the nation’s largest grass-
roots environmental organization. 
In a press release published on July 
16th, the organization — which is 
also endorsing Kunselman’s fellow 
candidates Jack Eaton and Mike 
Anglin — commended these men for

protecting the city’s environ-

ment.

James D’Amour, political chair 

of the Sierra Club, Huron Valley 
Group, said the three candidates 
support the environmental causes 
they value.

“These candidates have been con-

sistent in their policies and standing 
up for fundamental values we are 
looking for,” he said.

D’Amour also commended Kun-

selman for being “steadfast in the 
protection of our parks.”

Running against Kunselman is 

Zachary Ackerman. Ackerman has 
lived in Ann Arbor since he was 
eight years old and currently works 
as an IT supervisor for the Univer-
sity. He also works remotely on the 
national managing committee for 
a Washington DC-based human 
rights advocacy organization called 
STAND. Ackerman also worked on 
current Ann Arbor Mayor Christo-
pher Taylor’s campaign and serves 
on the executive board of the Ann 
Arbor Democratic Party.

Ackerman’s political agenda con-

sists of improving the city’s water 
and sewage systems, planting more 
trees in high-risk flood areas to 
increase initial protection against 
dangerous weather, making plans 
to provide housing or shelter to Ann 
Arbor’s homeless population, devel-
oping programs that allow residents 
to invest in renewable energy and 
improving public transit and traffic 
congestion.

Ackerman is endorsed by Mayor 

Taylor, former Ann Arbor Mayor 

John Hieftje, current councilwom-
an Julie Grand and the HVCLC.

Taylor believes Ackerman to be a 

similar politician to himself.

“Zach is a careful, thoughtful per-

son,” Taylor said. “We share many of 
the same values and visions.”

Ward 4: Jack Eaton (D) v. Jaime 

Magiera (D)

Like Briere and Kunselman, 

Eaton is also seeking re-election to 
City Council. Other than as a rep-
resentative for Ward 4, Eaton has 
served the city as an attorney and 
as the president of the Friends of 
Dicken Woods, an organization 
dedicated to preserving the integ-
rity of the underdeveloped Dicken 
Woods neighborhood. Eaton also 
founded the South Maple Group, an 
organization opposing a proposed 
housing development project on 
South Maple road and co-founded 
the Neighborhood Alliance, a group 
connecting neighborhood environ-
mental protectionists as well as his-
toric preservationists among other 
activist groups.

Eaton’s political agenda consists 

of adding jobs in the public safety 
sector, maintaining weekly trash 
pick-up, improving Ann Arbor’s 
stormwater system, restoring a leaf 
pick-up system in the fall, improving 
the city’s watersheds and protecting 
local transportation.

While Eaton is endorsed by the 

Sierra Club’s Huron Valley Group 
and Michigan Chapter as well as 
the HVCLC, Eaton does not seek out 
endorsements. In an e-mail to the 
Daily, Eaton wrote that he does not 
believe this information is critical to 
garnering votes.

Fund created to cover student’s medical costs

Fraternity brothers 

create page after 
member’s accident

By IRENE PARK

Daily Staff Reporter

After diving into shallow water 

to retrieve a volleyball at Lake Sher-
wood in Commerce Township, ris-
ing business junior Taylor Janssen 
broke his neck at the C5 vertebrae. 
Janssen was taken to the Univer-
sity Hospital, where he was treat-
ed in the intensive care unit until 
Wednesday, when he was trans-
ferred to a general hospital room to 
focus on physical therapy and talk-
ing.

Rising LSA junior Seth John-

son, Janssen’s friend and fellow Phi 
Kappa Psi fraternity brother, helped 
to set up a Gofundme page to raise 
money to help cover Janssen’s medi-
cal expenses. As of Wednesday, the 
page has raised $137,954.

Johnson said the fundraiser is 

the productive effort between his 
fraternity brothers.

“I set up the page with the fam-

ily’s permission but it was really an 
effort of all his friends,” Johnson 
wrote in an e-mail to the Daily. 
“The idea came from his fraternity 
brothers [Phi Kappa Psi] of which I 
am one.”

Janssen’s father, Mark Janssen, 

said in interview with MLive the 
incident has been emotional for his 

family.

“It’s devastating — I won’t sugar-

coat it,” Mark said. “He’s a strong 
kid. It is what it is.”

According to Johnson, Janssen 

was initially emotional once he got 
over the shock, but has made signifi-
cant progress since then.

“Taylor is a strong kid,” Johnson 

wrote. “Understandably, it has been 
an emotional process as the real-
ity of his situation has set in. Since 
then, however, Taylor has held an 
incredibly positive attitude, focus-
ing on surpassing every physical 
therapy goals given to him.”

Johnson added the accident has 

not affected Janssen’s mental state.

“He is completely there mentally, 

and is the same old Taylor,” Johnson 

wrote.

In addition to the support from 

the gofundme page, Janssen has 
received support from the Uni-
versity’s football players, who vis-
ited Janssen at his hospital bedside. 
Coach Jim Harbaugh sent him 
an e-mail. The 1980 U.S. Olympic 
hockey team captain Mike Eru-
zione tweeted his support for Jans-
sen, and former Detroit Red Wings 
coach Mike Babcock sent the family 
an inspirational video. The hashtag 
#JanssenStrong 
helped 
spread 

Janssen’s story on social media, 
building a community of support-
ers.

“It really kind of blows my mind 

away,” Mark Janssen said. “I’m just 
shocked by the response and hum-

bled, all at the same time.”

LSA rising junior Gabrielle Hous-

ka, Janssen’s friend, said she finds it 
great to see support from all over.

“It’s been amazing to see so 

many different communities come 
together to support Taylor and his 
family,” Houska said. “Every dona-
tion counts, and every ‘share’ shows 
the Janssens how much support 
they have behind them.”

Houska added Taylor’s friends 

hope to support him to return the 
positivity Taylor has given them.

“So many of his friends hope to 

support him in any way that returns 
one of the hundreds of smiles he put 
on our faces,” Houska said.

Navy awards University student scholarship 

Post-graduate training 
focuses on military and 

technical skills

By ALEX JUNTTI

Daily Staff Reporter

Engineering senior Johnathan 

Klee was selected for one of the 
Navy’s most prestigious and com-
petitive scholarships, the Navy 
Nuclear Propulsion Officer Candi-
date program.

Klee will receive a monthly 

income from the Navy throughout 
his senior year, including a food 
and housing allowance as well as 
military health-care benefits, in 
exchange for his service as a nucle-
ar engineer after graduation.

Lieutenant Jesse Hermsen, an 

engineering officer recruiter for the 
Navy, said Klee is a well-groomed 
student ready to take on the many 
challenges the NUPOC program 
has to offer.

“For the NUPOC scholarship, the 

Navy values leadership potential 
and a strong STEM academic back-
ground,” Hermsen said. “When I 
first met with John, I knew that 
he was somebody I’d like to serve 
with. John is a hard-working, bright 
young man who I saw as a future 
leader. I am confident that John will 
go far in the Navy with his work 
ethic and University of Michigan 
education.”

Klee said the Navy will give 

him an opportunity to utilize his 
engineering degree while gain-

ing organizational and leadership 
experience.

“The Navy is really one of the 

best employers for specialty and 
technical fields, which I am going 
into. In addition there is no better 
place to gain leadership and team-
work experience,” Klee said.

Klee has already taken a VIP 

trip to San Diego, where he vis-
ited a naval base and took a guided 
tour of both a Navy destroyer and a 
submarine. Klee has also flown to 
Washington D.C. where he inter-
viewed with the Navy’s top nuclear 
engineers and the Director of the 
Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program, 
Admiral John M. Richardson.

The next step for Klee is to attend 

a 12-week Officer Candidate School 
program in Rhode Island after he 
graduates. 

The course is designed to push 

recruits to their limits with an 
emphasis on training and militari-
zation, academics, weapons, leader-
ship management and naval history.

After OCS, Klee has several addi-

tional steps before he will trusted 
with managing nuclear reactors 
aboard naval aircraft carriers.

He will attend Nuclear Power 

School in Charleston, South Caro-
lina for six months. Following that, 
he will be sent to a nuclear power 
training unit and then he will be 
assigned to his first submarine.

Klee said he was both nervous 

and excited to be a part of the Navy 
and the nuclear propulsion pro-
gram.

“Of course, because I am in fact 

going to be on a warship, I’m a little 

apprehensive about the real-world 
experiences involved in protecting 
our national security,” Klee said.

Lt. Hermsen was very reassuring 

that the NUPOC program is one of 
the finest opportunities for dedicat-
ed engineers who show the capacity 
for leadership and excellence.

“The NUPOC program will pre-

pare future leaders for their initial 
training. Then they will be placed 
in charge of Sailors, cutting-edge 
technology and billions of dollars 
of advanced equipment,” Hermsen 
said. “NUPOC selectees will be 
taking on monumental responsi-
bilities while their counterparts in 
the civilian world are still working 
to get their careers off the ground. 
Whether students stay in the Navy 
for four or 24 years, they will gain 
valuable leadership experiences and 
responsibilities that will advance 
their careers, all while serving our 
country.”

Ready to dive into one of the 

greatest challenges of his life, Klee 
thanked the University of Michigan 
for preparing him for a career as a 
nuclear engineer with the Navy.

“My time here at Michigan has 

put me in a great position to take 
on this leadership role,” he said. 
“Whether it was from our group 
projects in Eng. 100 or just working 
on homework with friends, I have 
already gained experience get-
ting the group on track and work-
ing toward the same goal. Another 
component that has prepared me 
for this is simply challenging cur-
riculum and high expectations set 
by the professors.”

S

haista Kazmi, a Michigan local, 
was taking care of her elderly 
mother-in-law and father when 

she realized that 
she 
could 
use 

some help. How-
ever, 
when 
she 

called local senior 
service 
agencies, 

she realized there 
was 
a 
problem: 

the services being 
provided 
didn’t 

meet their cultural 
needs. Kazmi took 
initiative to found 
the company Apna Ghar, Urdu for 
“Your Home,” which provides homec-
are services catered to those from 
South Asian and Middle Eastern back-
grounds in Michigan.

One of the projects that Apna Ghar 

has been working on recently is pro-
viding cultural food with nutritional 
value to homebound seniors. When 
Kazmi spoke to Meals on Wheels, a 
senior service that delivers food to 
the elderly, she found that “they were 
aware 
that 
there 

were some cultural 
and religious issues 
and the halal meats 
are taken care of in 
Dearborn.” Howev-
er, what she “had to 
explain to them was 
that their palate was 
very different.”

Fortunately, Apna 

Ghar is planning to 
work with Meals on Wheels to fill some 
of these gaps to allow these seniors to 
use these resources that should be more 
readily available to them. They are a 
part of this community. As Kazmi says, 
many of them worked and raised fami-
lies here, and thus, their cultural differ-
ences shouldn’t make them unable to 
attain the same services as others.

“We’re just trying to get local agen-

cies to hear their voice because I don’t 
think their voice was being heard and 
their needs were being met,” Kazmi 
mentioned. Though local senior ser-
vices are likely happy to accommodate 
this elderly population, they are often 
unaware of their needs, or that these 
needs even exist.

This lack of cultural awareness is a 

problem that’s present in many social, 
work and school environments and 
needs to be addressed at every level.

In my daily interactions at school 

with my colleagues, or even with some 
school faculty, I sometimes find that 
lack of cultural awareness. To clarify, 
I don’t expect people to understand 
everything about my cultural, reli-
gious and socioeconomic background. 

To fully understand every culture and 
subculture is impossible, but what I do 
expect is for people to understand how 
to speak in a way that is culturally sensi-
tive and to think in a way that is cultur-
ally aware. I often find that some people 
who have questions are too afraid to ask 
because they’re unsure of exactly what 
words to use. I expect people to take 
something new that they learn about 
my culture as a learning opportunity as 
opposed to something to ridicule.

That’s what I expect at the Univer-

sity, and often I do find people with 
those qualities. I acknowledge that the 
University is making efforts to fix some 
of these problems by re-evaluating the 
race and ethnicity requirement and cre-
ating an Intergroup Relations minor. 
I acknowledge that the University is 
also trying to incorporate halal food in 
the dining halls to accommodate Mus-
lim students and that they try to com-
municate with students from different 
backgrounds to accommodate a range 
of student needs.

However, I also do not feel that 

the University itself strives enough 

to educate its stu-
dents and faculty 
on cultural aware-
ness, which could 
then be translated 
into 
the 
work-

place. This would 
hopefully 
also 

improve campus 
climate, but only 
if done effectively 
by addressing the 

real gaps.

Instead of the race and ethnicity 

requirement being a class that focuses 
on a single culture, there should be a 
requirement that educates students on 
how to conduct themselves in a way that 
is culturally aware. This could include 
appropriate language use, American 
demographics and how to differentiate 
between stereotypes and realities. How-
ever, this is something that professors 
should also keep in mind when teach-
ing about a specific culture or speaking 
to a student of a different background. It 
should be a part of training or orienta-
tion so that these gaps are filled.

The University is just one example 

of where this should be implement-
ed. 
Although 
cultural 
awareness 

is important in every situation and 
should be taught to students across 
many ages and workers in all occupa-
tions, it’s something we should strive 
for, to create a shift so that people 
appreciate diversity rather than shy 
away from it.

OPINION

If implemented, these bills 

would require employers to 
take on a greater role in the 
welfare of their female employ-
ees by informing them, and 
female applicants, of repro-
ductive health care coverage. 
This would allow women to 
make more informed deci-
sions regarding their health-
care and place of employment. 
Given the increased employer 
oversight in contraception and 
reproductive rights for their 
female employees, a possible 
result could be discrimination 
against women. This bill, how-
ever, anticipates and accounts 
for this possibility by including 
a provision that would prevent 
discrimination by employers 
against women based on their 

birth control.

The state would also have to 

take on a larger role in wom-
en’s reproductive health under 
this 
legislation. 
Particularly, 

the state would have to spread 
information about emergency 
contraception and ensure that 
emergency contraceptives are 
available to rape victims. These 
efforts toward better access 
to birth control are important 
considering the introduction 
of this set of bills comes after a 
large decrease in state funding 
for family planning in Michi-
gan; between fiscal years 2001 
and 2012, state funding for 
pregnancy prevention fell 91.6 
percent. According to the Mich-
igan Department of Health, this 
decrease in state aid correlates 

with an increase in unintended 
pregnancies; over this time 
period, the rate of pregnan-
cies that were unintended for 
women ages 15-19 rose from 
72.4 percent to 82.1 percent. 
These bills, through increased 
family planning funding that 
prioritizes education about and 
access to contraception, would 
reverse this trend.

By enabling more people to 

avoid the financial difficulties 
that come with unintended 
pregnancies, the cost of an 
abortion or the cost of rais-
ing a child, these bills would 
help create more financially 
stable 
individuals, 
families 

and 
communities. 
Needless 

to say, passing this legislation 
has overwhelming, undeniable

FROM THE DAILY

Better family planning
 Bills in Michigan legislature important for contraceptive access
O

n July 22, Rep. Winnie Brinks (D–Grand Rapids), chairwoman 
of the Progressive Women’s Legislative Caucus, introduced a 
package of bills aimed at creating better access to birth control 

and decreasing unintended pregnancies. These bills would, among 
other things, make emergency contraceptives available to rape victims 
and make it illegal for employers to discriminate against women based 
on their use of contraceptives. This proposed legislation should be 
passed, as it is a long overdue step toward leveling the playing field for 
women.

“This lack of cultural 

awareness is a problem 

in many social, 

work and school 

environments.”

B

ack when I used to be not 
happy, I constantly held 
within myself a great 

unease. 
On 

campus, the 
sun-emoji 
seemed 
to 

shine on every person’s keyboard 
except that of my own cracked, 
glass perimeter. None of my food 
emojis looked very appetizing, 
not even the shish-kabob with 
the three unidentified blobs of 
color poked high upon its pointy, 
wooden spear. The former joy I 
received from the alien emoji, in 
what seems like another lifetime 
now, had seemingly vanished 
forever. (Please, don’t inquire as 
to why I found it so joyful.)

No, I must maintain. I’m not 

one to sulk. And I believe that I 
didn’t and still haven’t.

Believe me, I have tried for-

ever and ever to find a way to be 
happy. To breach a new, more 
profound platform for my iden-
tity: one that made me feel tin-
gly and confident all at the same 
time, like I was regularly mixing 
the spice of life into my 50-cent 
ramen from Costco. If I knew 
how to properly identify an exis-
tential crisis, I might go as far 
as to say I was amid one: a very 
cloudy one indeed.

Oh, the things I’d try. I 

remember 
following 
around 

campus tours intended for pro-
spective freshmen for hours on 
end. Whole days. I thought they 
must know something about who 
I am. They must know some-
thing about why I’m here. If one 
feels one might be doing college 
wrong, wouldn’t it make sense 
to go back to the beginning? 
Wouldn’t it be logical? Oh but 
logic, that dirty game. That dirty 
trick the devil pulls out of the 
bag last, the one he keeps in the 
deeper pocket inside of the bag. 
Almost like “Temptation Incep-
tion.” Starring Leo as Jesus.

Of course, it didn’t help. All 

I learned was that the UGLi is 
not just called the UGLi because 
it sort of resembles some faux-
acronym. It actually once used 

to be ugly. As one might expect, 
I tried very hard to force an ana-
logical comparison of the trans-
formation from ugly to beautiful 
on my own story of my soul, but 
in the end, it seemed a B-inter-
jection at best. I couldn’t get 
over the fact that I was already 
beautiful. Beauty and unhappi-
ness aren’t mutually exclusive 
are they? In agony, I looked into 
the mirror and screamed my 
favorite line from Hamlet in my 
practiced English accent, “Death 
Hath become thee,” and then I 
 

moved on.

What else did I do?
I played a lot of pool at the 

bar and at the Union. I thought 
about angles and math. What 
was my angle? Did happiness 
have a formula? What if it’s just 
some hard equation written on a 
chalkboard in a classroom made 
for ghosts? I didn’t have time to 
answer these daring questions 
because something quite out of 
the ordinary happened.

One day, a random num-

ber texted me a shooting star 
emoji with a caption that said, 
“Make a wish, beautiful bae. and 
 

sleep tight.”

I didn’t care that I had 

received someone else’s digital 
goodnight kiss. I acted quickly, 
and you already know what I 
wished for.

My wish came true in the 

form of a Facebook notification. 
It said, “Friend X has just joined 
InstaGram. 
Download 
Insta-

Gram to view all of your friends 
v. cool pictures!”

I did just that. I am not too 

dumb to see God dumping out 
the Devil’s bag of tricks next 
to the ravine and stomping on 
them while she does it. I, indeed, 
helped her stomp and then I 
moved on to collect my reward.

Now you can find me @Spark-

manCashAut. I don’t know how 
to use filters yet, but you bet-
ter believe it’s a learning pro-
cess that I couldn’t be happier 
to be processing. I’m an Insta-
Machine. You can keep track of 
my every move when I throw a 

Chess Party now. You’ll see that 
pita kabob from Pita Kabob and 
that lobster bisque from Le Dog 
right before I eat it. You’ll know 
when I’m falling asleep on the 
couch at the University’s stu-
dent-run radio station, WCBN, at 
4 a.m. We’ll cherish the moment 
together.

No, I don’t think I’ve actually 

found THE secret to happiness, 
but isn’t it enough that I’ve found 
a new, completely absorbing dig-
ital media to distract me enough 
from all the pain and poverty 
and injustice in the world? You 
guys can keep running the rat 
race. I’m going to chill with this 
cheese for a minute. Yes, cheese 
is a pun here. At the moment, I’m 
ordering Friend X to smile wide 
before I take a snapshot of her 
and post it for my loyal 32 follow-
ers, #NoFilter.

To those who say that I’m late 

to the Insta-party, I’d like you 
to notice that I’m actually just 
showing up Insta-fashionably-
late. Can’t you tell by the Arizona 
State hoodie that I’m wearing by 
that bonfire? Yes, I have style for 
days.

What are the other perks, 

you ask, of now running the 
Instagram game? For one, now 
I don’t need to actually look 
at my friends. I can just take a 
picture of them and continue to 
gaze into my phone like we’re 
long lost lovers. A bonus being 
that my phone-version of them 
doesn’t get upset with me when 
I take a break from being enticed 
by their existence to see if any-
one has liked my most recent 
Facebook status or to see if that 
one magazine had accepted my 
fiction submission. They hadn’t, 
but it was okay because I could 
immediately take a picture of 
something new and get inspired 
all over again. Someone needs to 
write a fictional accompaniment 
to the Ants Mural on Maynard 
Street. When I’m Instafamous, 
I can’t help but wonder: Why 
couldn’t it be me?

BETHANY LEHMAN | VIEWPOINT

I am 18 years old. I am a female. 

I am a student, a writer, a fighter, 
an observer. I struggle with vanity. 
I struggle with self-acceptance. I 
struggle to be more forgiving, more 
generous and more knowledgeable 
tomorrow than I am today. I am 
 

a feminist.

Never has a statement elicited as 

negative a response as the last one.

I believe in equal rights for all 

people, and I believe that women are 
more disadvantaged than their male 
counterparts politically, economi-
cally and socially. I do not see fair-
ness or equality in a society that has 
not had a female president or when 
only 24 of the Fortune 500 CEOS are 
female, yet women make up more 
than half of the population. I see a 
society that forces both women and 
men into outdated, unfair, tradition-
al gender roles, or coerces people to 
adopt traditional characteristics or 
stereotypes 
of their gen-
der regard-
less of their 
individual 
desires. I see 
how 
these 

traditional 
roles 
hurt 

both 
gen-

ders deeply. 
I see how 
these 
roles 

hurt women 
— who are historically seen as less 
powerful than men or treated as 
men’s property — the most.

I am a feminist because I do 

not want to rely on anyone but 
myself for my own success or fail-
ure. I need feminism because I 
should not make less money than 
my male counterparts, or be told I 
am “bossy” for having an idea or a 
“bitch” for having an opinion. I am 
a feminist because every human 
deserves the same opportunities to 
succeed, prosper and live a life of 
their own choosing.

I am a feminist because it gave 

me the power to recover from an 
eating disorder — to finally see 
myself as more than my female 
body. Feminism showed me how 

wrong it was to believe I was only 
as good as my looks or the men that 
would date me. Feminism taught 
me I was more valuable than I had 
been treating myself.

I am a feminist because inequal-

ity breeds violence, and I walk in 
fear when I walk alone. I need fem-
inism because rape culture is my 
culture, and will be the inherited 
culture of my children one day.

I am a feminist because I believe 

that I have worth, that I have a 
voice that deserves to be heard. I 
have worthwhile contributions to 
make to society and should not be 
limited by my sex to certain occu-
pations or positions in society.

I am a feminist, yet I cannot 

explain feminism perfectly because 
I am not perfect. Every action of 
every feminist is not a grand state-
ment on feminism. I am a feminist-
human. I have done things that do 

not 
sup-

port 
my 

egalitar-
ian 
and 

feminist 
values. I 
am 
sure 

I will err 
again 
in 
the 

future. I 
apologize 
now 
for 

my short-

comings and hope I learn from 
 

every mistake.

I am a feminist because I want 

my future daughter to grow up 
believing in herself and her abil-
ity to choose the role she wants in 
society, be it a stay-at-home mother 
or a molecular engineer. Or both. I 
am a feminist because I do not want 
my son to feel that he is weak when 
he expresses kindness or sensitiv-
ity. I am a feminist because I want 
tomorrow to be better than today.

I am a feminist at a time when 

feminism is a bad word. I am a femi-
nist anyway.

‘I Am Cait’ docu-series, 
practical and powerful

TV REVIEW

After her Vanity Fair 

debut, viewers see 

Caitlyn Jenner

By CAROLINE FILIPS

Summer Senior Arts Editor

“I just hope I get it right,” she 

says. 

It’s no makeup o’clock, but she 

doesn’t 
mind. 

She has a story 
to tell, a mes-
sage to share and 
the voice of an 
unjustly margin-
alized 
commu-

nity to broadcast. 
It’s 4:32 in the 
morning, 
and 

she 
can’t 
help 

but lament the tragic, preventable 
transgender deaths before her 
time, before her voice, her mes-
sage and her story.

Dear world, meet Cait.
Sunday’s premiere of E!s new-

est docu-series “I Am Cait” was 
nothing short of a societal breath 
of fresh air. Clichés were banished 
(writers everywhere rejoice!), my 
sobs were audible and, hopefully, 
hearts and minds were opened. 
For the first time onscreen — off 
the pages of Vanity Fair and off 
the record — we met Caitlyn Jen-
ner, or her self-dubbed epithet, 
“the new normal”. 

For ten seasons on E!, view-

ers literally kept up with the 
partly vapid, yet equally fasci-
nating lives of the Kardashians. 
Sex tapes were leaked, earrings 
were lost in the ocean, Rob dated 
an ex-Cheetah Girl, Scott Dis-
ick became The Lord and mar-
riages were annulled after less 
than three months. Yet at its 
core, throughout life’s peaks 
and troughs, family came first 
for the clan; a family complete 
with Bruce Jenner, father figure 
for the children of Kris Jenner 
and the late Robert Kardashian, 
and the biological father of his 
daughters with Kris, Kendall 
and Kylie Jenner. 

Anytime 
catfights 
persisted 

longer than their usual five min-
utes, or Kendall and Kylie almost 
succumbed to high school cur-

riculums, or Kris lost her shit, 
Bruce always added a sense of nor-
malcy to each episode; he’d bring 
them back down to earth as they 
descended from their Balmain-
clad heights.

But 
despite 
his 
refreshing 

pragmatism in a household of 
all things nonsensical, Bruce 
deceived them all. He spent 
what’s recognized as the better 
part of one’s life with an internal 
pull, a wavering sense of self — a 
wrongly ascribed gender iden-
tity. After 65 years, a gold medal, 
three marriages and six children, 
Bruce bid adieu to his falsified 
lifestyle, and Caitlyn earnestly, 
determinedly emerged as the 
woman she always knew she was.

Like most significant social 

advancements as they come into 
fruition, the fight for transgender 
equality is marked by a horrify-
ing excess of devastating casual-
ties, with few, albeit triumphant, 
heroes. In the event of over-
whelmingly insufferable realities, 
most of us are mere spectators, 
too afraid to invalidate an unac-
cepting society on our own. How-
ever, valorous leaders invariably 
emerge. Cait’s taking a step in the 
right direction, emphasizing a 
takeaway for all — being one’s true 
self in their one life. 

Although Caitlyn is finally vic-

torious after a lifetime of internal 
battles, much of the transgender 
population doesn’t have the finan-
cial means to undergo the bodily 
reconstruction necessary to signal 
their transformation in an appear-
ance-obsessed society. For that, 
they’re misunderstood, mocked 

and in the most extreme cases, 
murdered. Cait is painfully aware 
of this. In the premiere’s open-
ing, intimate moments, she states 
“we don’t want people dying over 
this, we don’t want people mur-
dered over this stuff, God, what a 
responsibility I have”, recognizing 
her celebrity as crucial to halting 
unwarranted hate.

For the remaining 40 minutes, 

we’re privy to Cait’s habitual 
woes — ducking in the backseat to 
avoid the invasive paparazzi, the 
mourning of countless transgen-
der youths, along with the nerves 
accompanying her introductions 
to family and friends who knew 
her as Bruce. But the most moving 
initial encounter is that with her 
mother, Esther. Aside from the 
obvious reasons, it’s touching, yet 
relatable to all — it is clear that no 
matter how old we may be, we’re 
still intrinsically children; mom’s 
approval matters. 

‘I Am Cait’ strays from the dra-

matics so often inextricable from 
reality TV. As it’s majorly raw, unte-
thered Cait and her sincere exchang-
es and blithe smiles, the scripted 
aspect is seldom recognizable. 

In its poignant, yet practical 

approach to championing the 
rights of transgender individuals, 
‘Cait’ excels. The realistic, nur-
turing approach once reserved to 
resolving trivial matters within 
the Kardashian household was 
so essential to Bruce Jenner’s 
stoic, yet playful presence on the 
series. With Cait, her zeal for life 
is amplified, pairing that inher-
ent levelheadedness with resolute 
self-acceptance.

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

By CATHERINE SULPIZIO

Senior Arts Editrix

There is only one sandwich 

to eat in August, and that’s the 
tomato sandwich. As a self-pro-
claimed tomato-phile, abstract 
concepts like “in-season” or 
“local” don’t impinge on my 
year-round consumption. But 
let’s make this clear: there is a 
world of difference between the 
mealy varieties found in even 
the best grocery stores (looking 
at you, Whole Foods) that I eat 
with a melancholic air and the 
sublime specimens that start 
popping up in farmer’s markets 
around June. The latter are the 
only ones to buy during summer. 
By late July, they’re impossibly 
sweet (I would call it ambrosial, 
but my editor would call that 
hyperbolic) and brimming with 
green seeds and juices and a 
special je ne sais quoi, especial-
ly if you leave them out on the 
counter for a few days (Never 
refrigerate tomatoes. Ever.).

You can eat them like an 

apple with a saltshaker on a 
porch if you want to. You can 
arrange slices of them on a plat-
ter with avocado slivers, a gen-
erous drizzle of olive oil and a 
squeeze of lemon, or roast them 
until they’re these gem-like 
orbs sublated to their sweet-
est, tartest essence with a bit-
ter trace of caramelization — or 
you can do the best of these 
and make a tomato sandwich. 
It’s so simple, yet it is the epi-
curean embodiment of ingre-
dients transcending the sum of 
their parts. This is the sand-
wich I dream of during the cold 
months of dusty root vegetables 
with nary a vermilion sphere in 
sight, and now is the peak time 

to make it.

Here’s what you do. Go to 

Ann Arbor Farmers Market, 
Saturday or Wednesday. Buy 
a tomato — heirloom, plum, 
beefsteak, red, green, yellow, 
zebra — anything that’s haz-
ardously soft to the touch and 
speaks to you. I have a working 
theory that ugly tomatoes are 
the yummiest and it has yet to 
fail me. Other people (read: less 
informed) are more squeamish, 
but the ones with busted seams, 
all misshapen, the outcasts of 
the nightshade world are the 
ones to zero in on. Make sure 
it’s teetering on overripe so you 
get all those vital juices.

Buy rye bread. Some pur-

ists insist on Wonder Bread but 
I swear by the deep, slightly 
sour taste of Jewish rye. It cuts 
through the tomato without 
being too distracting. Mayon-
naise is yet another disputation. 
Southerners swear by Duke’s. 
Others are fine with Hellman’s. 
Only blasphemers use Miracle 
Whip. I personally use my own 
profane brand: vegan. Hear 
me out, Just Mayo, Hampton 
Creek’s version, is amazing. So 
amazing, it beat out regular car-
nivore mayo in a Serious Eats 
taste test. No artificial ingre-
dients, soy-free, blah blah blah, 
but most importantly, free of any 
sweetness like other conven-
tional ones, and tart.

Toast the bread, slather on the 

mayo of your choice, and slice the 
tomatoes into thick slabs. Don’t 
you dare core it — the seeds are 
the best part. Salt and pepper 
judiciously. Eat it over the kitch-
en sink or do like I do and put it 
on a plate and grab a wad of nap-
kins so you can sink into bliss at 
your own convenience.

Actor Alan Ruck talks 
career & ‘Major Crimes’

‘Ferris Bueller’s Day 

Off’ cast member 
guest stars on TNT

By REGAN DETWILER

Daily Arts Writer

Alan Ruck … you might not 

know the name but you may know 
the voice, and you definitely know 
the face. Ruck is best known for 
his role in the iconic John Hughes 
film, “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” as 
Cameron, Bueller’s existentially 
troubled best friend. Now 59 years 
old and having inhabited the film 
world for decades, one of his most 
recent projects was guest starring 
on Monday’s episode of TNT’s 
good-humored, 
high-intensity 

police drama, “Major Crimes,” as 
the incorrigible FBI Special Agent 
Jerry Shea. 

With a loyal but small fan 

base, “Major Crimes” is TNT’s 
continuation of “The Closer,” 
which went off the air in 2012, 
and stars Mary McDonnell as 
Sharon Raydor, captain of the 
Los Angeles Police Department’s 
Major Crimes Unit. The cast of 
the show has a certain effortless 
chemistry that I’ve found doesn’t 
exist for many crime dramas that 
are popular today. 

In Monday’s episode the LAPD 

investigated a murder associated 
with a young man’s alleged kid-

napping, which FBI Special Agent 
Jerry Shea (Alan Ruck) had 
investigated in the past. He had 
even appeared on shows compa-
rable to “Dateline” or “Ameri-
can Justice” as a specialist on 
the case, which both enlarged 
his already humongous ego and 
enraged his colleagues at the 
Bureau. To top it off, Shea had 
also written a novel based off 
the case under the pseudonym 
Guy LaFontaigne — and yes, that 
should be pronounced in a full-
fledged French accent. 

“Yeah, he’s a jerk,” Ruck said of 

his character in a phone interview 
with The Michigan Daily. 

Lucky for the LAPD, the FBI 

“no longer trusts” Shea and sends 
him over to Major Crimes so that 
they may be distracted by his 
belligerent egotism while the 
FBI solves the case, takes all the 
glory, etc., leaving viewers in the 
LAPD’s office with a spectacular 
medley of personalities to enjoy. 

Having worked with leading 

actor Mary McDonnell, having 
met the episode’s director Paul 
McCrane and having met support-
ing actor Tony Denison here and 
there, Ruck said making the episode 
“kinda felt like a family reunion.”

“You really try to pray for 

parts like this,” he said of his 
role as Jerry Shea. “I am serious-
ly middle-aged,” he continued, 
explaining that with a wife and 
two young children, he enjoys 

smaller roles that he can pour all 
of his effort into. 

When asked about how his 

role in “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” 
has affected the rest of his acting 
career, he said it was “the best 
part I’ve ever had in a movie, 
surely,” and that he’s glad people 
still enjoy the film. 

Having grown up in Cleve-

land, Ohio, Ruck said he wanted 
to be an actor from a young age. 
The young Alan Ruck wanted to 
be just like his fellow Cleveland 
native, Paul Newman, that sexy 
movie star who didn’t make his 
first film until the age of 29. 

It just so happens that Ruck was 

29 years old when he acted in “Fer-
ris Bueller’s Day Off,” and after 
such a huge role, Ruck said he was 
simply convinced his career would 
be downhill from there. 

Having come to terms with 

what he called an up and down 
career, Ruck said he’s satisfied 
with where he is now, having 
some good work behind him and 
being able to continue acting. 

“Instead of being careful what 

you wish for…be specific what 
you wish for,” the actor said as a 
word of advice for young people. 

Monday’s episode of “Major 

Crimes” was a success. Ruck 
clicked with the cast seamlessly, 
adding splashes of humor and 
making it easy to believe that 
filming the episode was a sort of 
“family reunion.”

When it was announced that 

Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga 
would 
release 
a 
collaborative 

album, the obvious thought was 
“what an odd pair.” When Cheek To 
Cheek came out, it was a surprise 
of the best nature — a beautifully-
crafted, precisely sung jazz duet. 
The pair seamlessly carried over 
their partnership to the stage of 
Meadow Brook Music Festival this 
past Monday.

There was no opening, just some 

smooth tunes playing over the 
speakers and just after 8:30 p.m. 
the duo took the stage. Tony sport-
ing a light blue suit jacket and Gaga 
sheathed in a shimmering silver 
gown. They open their sets with 
the booming “Anything Goes.” It’s 
hard not to notice the chemistry 
between the two. They produce 
an aura of true friendship and 
genuine appreciation. They ecstati-
cally introduce one another; “Lady 
Gaga!” Bennett shouts as he waves 
his arm towards her; she does the 
same. As he sang, she stood next to 
him with her hand on his shoulder 
tapping to the beat. They quickly 
move into title track “Cheek to 
Cheek,” during which they dance, 
quite literally, cheek to cheek. Then 
Gaga heads off stage and Bennett 
goes solo for “They All Laughed.” 

The stage, set up much like a 

dueling piano bar, had two nearly 
complete bands. Bennett’s on the 
left and Gaga’s on the right. When 
Bennett took the stage alone, his 
band was illuminated in lights 
while Gaga’s sat patiently in the 
dark, and vice versa. And when they 
met for duets, both bands became 
fully engaged. 

Bennett maintained his light 

blue suit-coat throughout the eve-

ning, while Gaga rocked several 
outfits. Ranging from a pale pink 
gown with an enlarged bow, to a 
silver studded leotard paired with 
a sheer shawl. Her attire, while at 
points revealing, never once over-
shadowed the jazz. Conversely, her 
sleek appearance seemed to only 
escalate the essence of seduction 
found in jazz.

The two superstars whisked their 

way through nearly 3 dozen songs 
over the course of their 95-minute 
set, each taking solos and coming 
together when the song required it. 
Vocally, both were stunning. Ben-
nett, even with age, has kept every 
ounce of power and finesse. Gaga, 
often thought of as an auto-tuned 
pop star, is probably one of the best 
technical singers of our generation 
— she received a standing ovation 
following her take on Edith Piaf’s 
“La vie en rose,” during which she 
sang perfect French. Bennett also 
had a handful of standing ovations 
from the diverse crowd. 

It was unlike any concert I’ve 

attended before. I sat the entire 
time, which is a far cry from my 
typical standing and dancing per-
sona. However, as I sat there leaned 
over, attempting to get as close 
to the show as possible I found 
myself mesmerized. This music, 
it felt pure. I could hear the bass, 
and I could see the bassist singular 
strums. I could hear every inflec-
tion in either performers voice. It 
didn’t have all the pizzazz of a typi-
cal 2015 concert because the music 
did all of that on its own. 

By the time the duo slipped into 

their final song, “It Don’t Mean a 
Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing),” 
the crowd still wanted more. Not 
because we weren’t given enough, 
but because with a show that sim-
plistically stunning, you can watch 
for hours. You can listen for hours.

ing with voters, I find that they 
are interested in what I have done 
during my first term and what my 
positions are on issues that interest 
them. I cannot recall any voter ever 
asking about endorsements.”

However, in a newsletter pub-

lished by his campaign on July 11th, 
Eaton was quoted saying he is very 
grateful for the endorsements from 
the Sierra Club and HVCLC.

“I am proud to announce that the 

Huron Valley Central Labor Council

Council,” he said. “I have strong ties 
to the labor movement, and I share 
their goals and values. For those rea-
sons, I am especially grateful for the

Eaton echoed this statement 

when expressing his gratitude to the

“I am proud of my work with 

the Sierra Club and look forward to 
being an environmental advocate 
in the years to come,” he said. “I 
am especially gratified that a group

“Jaime is a newcomer to politics

In memory of rising LSA senior, Josh Brigham

University community 

mourns loss of 
active member 

By LARA MOEHLMEN

Summer Managing News Editor

Early Friday morning, the Uni-

versity community lost an active 
member: Joshua Brigham, a rising 
LSA senior studying psychology.

Brigham, 
who 
fatally 
fell 

through the glass roof of Nickels 
Arcade, was originally from Sau-
gatuck, Michigan and attended 
Hamilton High School where he 
was a competitive soccer player.

Brigham’s passion for sports 

continued during his time at the 
University, where he played intra-
mural basketball and soccer for his 

fraternity, Chi Phi.

Known for his outgoing and 

personable 
charisma, 
Brigham 

was also social chair of his fra-
ternity for two semesters. In an 
e-mail interview with The Michi-
gan Daily, Nathan Shi, a rising LSA 
senior who was Brigham’s friend 
and fraternity brother, remembers 
his ability to make those around 
him happy.

“He was the kind of guy that if 

you were having an off day, would 
come into the room and be so 
energetic that you just had to get 
up and be energetic too,” Shi said. 
“He was always cracking jokes and 
trying to lighten the mood. It was 
nice, given that college gets pretty 
stressful at times. He was always 
smiling and trying to make things 
positive, even when they seemed 
pretty bleak or bland.”

Alec Buchholtz, a rising LSA 

senior, said Brigham was his best 
friend, recalling his uplifting spir-
it.

“He was one of the best people 

to be around and just made every-
one happier — made everyone 
laugh. He had this unbeatable 
smile that made you smile,” Buch-
holtz said.

Brigham was passionate about 

serving others, particularly chil-
dren. For several years, he worked 
as a Special Olympics coach with 
his father, encouraging children 
with disabilities to play sports. 
Brigham also participated in child 
psychology research at the Uni-
versity and was scheduled to work 
this summer at Camp Kesem, a 
camp on the University’s campus 
dedicated to providing support for 
children with parents suffering 

from cancer.

Rising LSA senior Brendan May 

said Brigham had aspirations of 
working with children as a future 
career.

“I know he definitely wanted to 

work with kids when he graduated 
and was older. That was his pas-
sion,” May said.

In a statement released to 

media outlets, Laura Blake Jones, 
Dean of Students at the University, 
expressed 
the administration’s 

grief and support.

“We are deeply saddened by this 

tragic loss. Our condolences go out 
to his family and friends,” Blake 
said.

The administration has been 

reaching out to students, especial-
ly Brigham’s close friends, to make 
sure they are aware of the Univer-
sity’s resources, such as Counsel-

ing and Psychological Services.

May said although he and his 

friends will grieve this sum-
mer, they will forever remember 
Brigham for the positive impact he 
made on their lives.

“When we get back to school, 

we’re not going to remember Josh 
for what happened last Thurs-
day night/Friday morning. We’re 
going to remember him for the 
lives he’s touched — the hearts he’s 
impacted.”

To honor Brigham’s memory, 

several community members have 
placed flowers and notes on the 
floor of Nickels Arcade.

Brigham is survived by parents 

Joe Brigham and Michelle Leiter-
man and a younger sister, Sam.

far include presenting a resolution 

to request all Ann Arbor streets have 
a speed limit of 25 mph and propos-
ing the completion of a Washtenaw 
Border-to-Border Trail. Outside of 
his involvement with the council, 
Anglin serves the Ann Arbor com-
munity by volunteering with orga-
nizations such as Kiwanis, Meals 
on Wheels and the Family Learning 
Institute.

If re-elected, Anglin looks to pre-

serve the integrity of the city’s neigh-
borhoods, maintain and improve the 
city’s vital services and infrastruc-
ture and be an advocate for the city’s 
park system.

Anglin is endorsed by the Sierra 

Club, Huron Valley Group and the 
Michigan Chapter, along with many 
Ann Arbor community members — 
endorsements that can be found on 
his campaign’s webpage. Many of 
the people featured on the site said 
Anglin has made a great City Coun-
cil member thus far.

“Mike Anglin has been a terrific 

Council member,” former council-
member Bob Johnson said. “(He) 
has always fought for fiscal sanity 
and for a city government that prior-
itizes its resources and expenditures 
so that projects that truly benefit the 
citizens of Ann Arbor can be imple-
mented. He has worked for better 
roads, safer streets and environmen-
tal values.”

Anglin’s 
competitor 
is 
Chip 

Smith. Smith has been a city resident 

since moving to the Ann Arbor for 
graduate school in 1995. For the last 
15 years, he has been an urban plan-
ner for Wade Trim Associates, Inc., 
for whom he works on a range of city 
issues such as zoning, planning and 
the delivery of services.

If he is elected to represent the 

fifth ward, Smith hopes to develop 
a comprehensive plan for organic 
and food waste diversion, encour-
age the growth of green infrastruc-
ture around the city, add improve 
all forms of transit, specifically by 
implementing a commuter rail line 
from Ann Arbor to Detroit.

Smith is one of the three candi-

dates that Mayor Taylor is endors-
ing.

“I’ve known (Chip Smith) for 

years,” Taylor said. “He is smart and 
thoughtful and engaged and looking 
forward to finding the right balance 
between the provision of basic ser-
vices and making improvement to 
the quality of life.”

Emina Bektas reflects 
on her storied career

By LELAND MITCHINSON

Daily Sports Writer

When 
Emina 
Bektas 
was 

looking for a college to continue 
her tennis career, the most 
important factor was a tight-
knight team atmosphere.

At Michigan, she found exactly 

what she wanted.

“I went to a team dinner and I 

could just kind of tell that it was 

such a team and such a family 
atmosphere,” Bektas said. “You 
could just tell that the girls got 
along so well.”

Bektas 
attended 
the 
John 

Newcombe 
Tennis 
Academy 

in Texas, where she focused 
on 
individual 
development. 

However, her participation in an 
academy didn’t mean she didn’t 
get to experience the team aspect 
of the game.

“We had team (competitions) 

in our region and district,” 
Bektas said. “Every time I had 
those tournaments, they were 
always the most fun,” Bektas 
said. “Just being around a group 
of girls that love being there, 
that love being around each 
other and with the coaches.

“I knew that that’s what 

I wanted. I loved the team 
atmosphere.”

One thing Bektas didn’t need 

coming into college was time 
to adjust. Bektas immediately 
competed in the No. 1 position 
for the Wolverines in every 
dual match her freshman year, 
going 32-10 overall. She also 
excelled in doubles, finishing 
the season with a 33-10 record 
playing in the No. 1 doubles 
position, paired with then-
sophomore Brooke Bolender.

“I thought she would really 

blossom in the college tennis 
format,” 
said 

Michigan 
coach 
Ronni 

Bernstein. “She 

stepped in and 
played No. 1 all 
four 
years 
and 

was 
dominant 

there, which, to 
have 
somebody 

up top like that 
that’s 
winning 

and competing so hard and giving 
us that point almost every match, 
was huge for our program and she 

made a huge impact.”

That success carried over into 

her sophomore year, when she 
finished the season ranked No. 
33 individually, and fourth in 
doubles with Bolender.

Though 
she 

stepped into a 
big role in her 
first two years, 
there was still 
room to grow as 
a leader on the 
team.

“I remember 

going back home 
for 
Christmas 

break 
(junior 

year), and I sort of started figuring 
things out,” Bektas said. “I knew 
that since I was finally able to 
help myself, I was able to pull the 
other girls with me as well. I mean, 
obviously it wasn’t perfect along 
the way, I still had my moments, 
but (that realization) helped me out 

a lot.”

Coming 

off that break 
in her junior 
year, 
she 

took her play 
up 
another 

level, 
setting 

a 
Michigan 

record 
for 

singles 
wins 

in 
a 
season 

with 38. She kept it going in her 
senior year, going 33-8, leading 
Michigan to its first Big Ten 

Tournament title and winning 
her second straight Big Ten Player 
of the Year award.

She also helped to usher in the 

next generation of Wolverines, 
taking her new doubles partner, 

freshman Alex 
Najarian, under 
her wing on the 
way to a 30-9 
record with her 
new teammate.

Bektas 

finished 
her 

college 
career 

with 
more 

accolades than 
she could keep 

track of. She ends her career as 
Michigan’s all-time leader in 
singles wins and overall wins. 
On top of the team wins record, 
Bektas was unanimously voted 
first team Big Ten all four years of 
her time as a Wolverine.

“I 
think 
Emina, 
through 

her four years, matured in that 
(leadership) role and understood 
it more,” Bernstein said. “I don’t 
think she understood it when 
she first came in, so definitely 
by her senior year it was really 
important to her, and she did a 
great job in that role making sure 
everybody was (comfortable) in 
the team.”

Bektas 
came 
to 
Michigan 

looking for a close team, and she 
found one. In return, she gave 
them more than they could ever 
ask for.

FOOTBALL
Notebook: Legends jerseys to be re-retired Nov. 28

By ZACH SHAW

Summer Managing Sports Editor

After two years of controversy 

and 
awkward 
numbers, 

the 
Michigan 
football 
team 

announced that its “Legends” 
jersey program would be retired.

The program — which honored 

Michigan’s five retired numbers by 
giving them to current Wolverines 
— unretired the jersey numbers of 
Gerald Ford (No. 48), Tom Harmon 
(98), Ron Kramer (87), Bennie 
Oosterbaan (47), and Albert, Alvin 
and Whitey Wistert (11). The 
program drew controversy from 
fans and program alumni.

“During the search process 

for our new football coach, I had 
a meeting with the Michigan 
football team and they expressed 
their feelings associated with 
wearing these legendary jerseys,” 
said Interim Athletic Director Jim 

Hackett in a released statement. 
“At one end of the spectrum they 
are awed by the legacy of the men 
who wore them and at the other 
end of the spectrum, and as part of 
a team sport, they wondered why 
we would call attention to one of 
our team members.

“I brought this issue to our new 

head coach Jim Harbaugh. He 
agreed with me that it needed a 
review. I then talked to the families 
of these great Michigan players. I 
called them directly and laid out 
the paradox of seeing players as a 
team and the due respect to these 
individual great players.”

All 
five 
numbers 
will 
be 

retired in a joint ceremony before 
Michigan’s game against Ohio 
State, Nov. 28. 1991 Heisman 
Trophy winner Desmond Howard 
will also have his No. 21 retired in 
the ceremony.

“The right plan is to retire 

them and display them in Towsley 
Museum which is connected to 
Schembechler 
Hall,” 
Hackett 

said. “Because we don’t have the 
display area inside the stadium, 
we have found an area on the 
concourse where fans can see and 
honor these retired jerseys.”

Peppers a three-way player?
After 
having 
his 
much-

anticipated 
freshman 
season 

cut short due to injury, redshirt 
freshman safety Jabrill Peppers 
may have a chance to return in a 
big way.

Regarded as one of the nation’s 

best athletes from his recruiting 
class, 
Harbaugh 
indicated 

Tuesday that Peppers may be 
used on offense, special teams and 
defense.

“There’s three ways that you 

can contribute,” Harbaugh said. 
“You can contribute offensively, 
defensively and on special teams. 

It’s rare that someone does offense, 
defense and special teams.

“It’s exciting when someone’s 

capable of doing that, it means they 
have some real gifts athletically 
and they’re really smart and 
sharp enough to understand three 
different systems.”

At Paramus Catholic High 

School in New Jersey, Peppers 
rushed for 3,059 yards, passed 
for 92 yards and tallied 883 yards 
receiving. He also scored 60 
touchdowns in three seasons on 
offense.

“If you have the capability 

athletically of doing that and 
you have the desire to do that, 
then we’ll explore it,” Harbaugh 
said. “Jabrill’s never struck me as 
someone who has ever (had) his 
head spin (on the field). He’s not 
one of those type of youngsters. 
He has a very tight grip of his 
mind, he’s very sharp and very 

focused.

“Nor 
have 
I 
seen 
him 

unconfident. He’s very confident 
in his abilities.”

Ball is in Norfleet’s court to 

return

Another potential three-way 

player is still considering if he’ll 
join the Wolverines at all in the 
fall. Former return man Dennis 
Norfleet was reportedly kicked off 
the team in June.

Though he has been granted 

permission 
to 
speak 
with 

Tuskegee 
University, 
among 

others, Harbaugh hopes Norfleet 
can return to Michigan.

“A plan was put into place for 

Dennis so he could accomplish 
all his goals athletically and 
academically 
(at 
Michigan),” 

Harbaugh said. “Our desire is that 
he gets his Michigan degree, and 
that plan hasn’t changed from our 
viewpoint.”

“I could just 
tell that it was 
such a team and 

family.”

Bektas finished 

with more 

accolades than 
she could track.

Barnes Arico wins 
gold with USA team 

By BRAD WHIPPLE 

Daily Sports Writer

Sunday, 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball coach Kim Barnes Arico 
watched her players celebrate a 
championship win.

But 
they 
weren’t 
wearing 

maize and blue. And she wasn’t in 
America.

Instead, she was in Chekhov, 

Russia, surrounded by the best 
19-year-old talent in the world. 
And her team — donning red, white 
and blue — stormed the court as 
confetti rained from the ceiling. 
And soon, Barnes Arico held a gold 
medal in front of a wide smile.

In her second 

straight summer 
as 
an 
assistant 

coach 
for 
USA 

Basketball, 
Barnes 
Arico 

helped lead the 
USA team on a 
7-0 run in the 
FIBA U19 World 
Championship, 
a campaign that 
began July 18 and 
ended Sunday with a 78-70 win 
over Russia, giving the team its 
sixth straight gold medal.

Barnes Arico also guided the 

U18 team to a gold medal last 
summer, qualifying them for a 
shot at this year’s trophy.

“It was an incredible feeling,” 

Barnes Arico told USA Basketball. 
“For the last two years, I feel so 
honored to have been asked to help 
coach for USA Basketball. To have 
the opportunity to be surrounded 
by greatness, whether it is the 
players that I have opportunity 
to coach that are the best in 
their particular age group, or the 
coaches and the staff that I get to 
work with everyday. … It has been 
a dream come true.”

After going 3-0 in group play to 

earn Group B’s top seed, the United 
States cruised past Argentina, 
Canada and Spain to earn a spot in 
the championship game. Against 
Russia, the United States turned 
an eight-point deficit into a five-
point lead by halftime.

U.S. center Chatrice White 

finished the third quarter off with 
a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to 
maintain her team’s momentum, 
and the United States ultimately 

survived, led by forward A’Ja 
Wilson’s 30 points, a U19 single-
game record that made the captain 
the tournament’s Most Valuable 
Player.

Wilson, who helped South 

Carolina to this year’s Final Four, 
carved her name in the record 
books as one of the world’s best 
19-year-old basketball players, and 
is the stand-out example of the 
excellence Barnes Arico has been 
surrounded by this summer.

“Every game that we’re in, I can 

pick up something from the other 
team (and) from our team,” Barnes 
Arico told MGoBlue.com on July 
13. “Maybe a new out-of-bounds 

play, 
maybe 

a new set, or 
maybe this is 
how this coach 
does 
things. 

I 
think 
it’s 

always 
great 

to learn new 
things, and to 
just 
continue 

to learn and 
continue 
to 

grow.”

Aside from exposure to the 

world’s best players, Barnes Arico 
worked with a coaching staff that 
boasted a heavy resume.

Assistant coach Jeff Walz, the 

winningest coach in Louisville 
women’s 
basketball 
history, 
used 

to be a regular 
opponent 
for 

Barnes 
Arico 

during her time 
in the Big East. 
Since 
2007, 

Walz 
has 
led 

Louisville 
into 

the national spotlight with five 
NCAA tournament appearances, 
including this year’s Sweet 16. 
Walz’s 
success 
mirrors 
what 

Barnes Arico hopes to achieve at 
Michigan.

U.S. head coach Dawn Staley 

has always caught the admiration 
of Barnes Arico. The WNBA 
veteran and three-time Olympic 
gold medalist led Wilson and the 
Gamecocks to the this year’s Final 
Four with a heavy defensive focus, 
a focus Barnes Arico continues to 
instill in Michigan.

“For the last two years, I have 

had the opportunity to work 
with (Staley) and I have learned 
so much from her,” Barnes Arico 
said. “It has been great to be 
surrounded by her for an extended 
period of time, to be surrounded 
by excellence. I have enjoyed 
every minute of it.”

Barnes Arico nearly had one of 

her own appear on the international 
stage. Back in May, sophomore 
guard 
Katelynn 
Flaherty 
was 

invited to compete at the U19 trials 
in Colorado Springs. But among the 
34 attendees, she didn’t make the 
final 12-member team.

As for Barnes Arico, she moved 

on to find success at an even higher 
level.

“This is another opportunity to 

(learn and grow) at a high level,” 

Barnes 
Arico 

said. “So when 
I come back to 
Michigan, 
if 

I can tweak a 
couple 
things 

or pick up some 
things 
from 

other 
coaches 

and 
programs 

that have been 

champions, that’s only going to 
help our program be better.”

This 
season, 
Barnes 
Arico 

nearly became the first coach to 
hang a banner for the Wolverines 
this when they reached the WNIT 
Semifinals. Still, she’s off to the 
best three-year start for any coach 
in program history. Her growth 
hasn’t stopped in the summer, as 
she was surrounded by the best 
talent in the country and in the 
world.

It earned Team USA a gold 

medal. And it could earn Michigan 
its first banner.

RITA MORRIS/Daily

Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico will look to apply what she learned as part of the USA team to her team’s upcoming season.

“This is an 

opportunity to 
(grow) at a high 

level.”

“I have enjoyed 
every minute of 

it.”

Catching up with former 
Michigan basketball stars

By MAX BULTMAN 

Daily Sports Editor

It has been a busy summer for 

Michigan basketball alumni.

Two recent stars have been 

traded, and another finally appears 
to have found a longer-term home. 
Whether they’ve stayed put or 
moved around, there has been no 

shortage of developments for the 
former Wolverines.

So, with the NBA Summer 

League now in the books, The 
Daily put together a roundup of 
what notable Michigan alumni 
have been up to this offseason.

Nik Stauskas: Stauskas was 

traded from the Sacramento Kings 
to the Philadelphia 76ers, which 

is sort of like escaping the Titanic 
in a life raft without a paddle. You 
made it out alive, but you have 
to do a lot of work before feeling 
secure again.

On the 76ers, Stauskas should 

have a chance for more touches, 
which will be a warm welcome 
after sharing minutes with former 
Kansas standout Ben McLemore 
in Sacramento. This summer, he 
came back to Ann Arbor to work 
with Michigan strength and con-
ditioning coach Jon Sanderson and 
will hope to build on a strong finish 
to last season.

Tim Hardaway Jr.: Hardaway 

was part of a draft-day trade to 
the Atlanta Hawks, flipping him 
from one of the worst teams in the 
league (New York) to one of the 
best. The problem now might be 
finding minutes.

The Hawks have Kyle Korver 

and Kent Bazemore at Hardaway’s 
position, so he’ll have to fight for 
time on the court. Still, his career 
10.8 points per game is a respect-
able number, and being part of a 
winning environment could help 
raise Hardaway’s pedigree.

Glenn Robinson III: After a 

rookie year that saw him waived 
by the Minnesota Timberwolves 
and claimed by the 76ers, Robinson 
dazzled fans with 360 dunks and 
big numbers for the Hawks’ Sum-
mer League team along with fellow 

former Wolverine Jon Horford. He 
played so well that his hometown 
Indiana Pacers signed Robinson to 
a three-year contract at the end of 
Summer League.

Robinson enters the season as 

the fourth small forward on the 
Pacers’ depth chart, but his ver-
satility could allow him to move 
around for them. It’s hard to imag-
ine Robinson in their regular rota-
tion just yet, but his improvement 
was widely praised in Summer 
League. Maybe he has more in 
store for the season.

Mitch 
McGary: 
When 
he 

wasn’t making appearances at the 
Women’s College World Series, 
McGary continued his rise to cult 
heroism with hustle plays and put-
back dunks that made the rounds 
on social media. He recently 
told NewsOK.com he had lost 20 
pounds over the summer, giving 
hope that McGary could still live 
up to his potential.

His energy and athleticism 

could pay big dividends for the 
Oklahoma City Thunder, a team 
that looks ready to contend for a 
title. It wouldn’t be too surprising if 
the new-look McGary has a break-
out season for the Thunder.

Then again, McGary still has to 

beat out fellow centers Enes Kant-
er and Steven Adams for minutes. 
Health will a key factor in that, and 
down 20 pounds, this could be the 
year Big Mitch manages to stay on 
the court.

Trey Burke: Burke’s playing 

time trailed off a bit last year with 
the emergence of Dante Exum. 
He still managed 12.8 points per 
game and nearly five assists, but 
his shooting percentage was hov-
ering around 38 — too low to war-
rant the 30 minutes per game he 

was getting.

There were rumors Burke might 

be traded this offseason, but he 
stayed put, and still has a chance 
to stick around in Utah. The Jazz 
have a bright future, and Burke will 
still have opportunities to carve 
out a role with them.

He had a handful of 20-point 

games last season, and if he can get 
his shot more consistent, we could 
see Burke play a role for a playoff 
contender sooner rather than later.

Jamal Crawford: Remember 

Jamal Crawford? The Clippers’ 
sixth man hasn’t received the con-
tract extension he was hoping for, 
but still finds himself surrounded 
by a bevy of talent in Los Ange-
les. Chris Paul, Blake Griffin and 
DeAndre Jordan have the Clippers 
once more primed for a playoff run, 
and bringing Lance Stephenson 
will make for an interesting experi-
ment as well.

Crawford is 35, but he can still 

play, and he should still have a 
well-defined roll off the bench in 
2015-16.

Jordan Morgan: After playing a 

year in Italy with Virtus Roma, the 
former Wolverine captain joined 
the Orlando Magic and Minne-
sota Timberwolves for the Orlando 
and Las Vegas Summer Leagues, 
respectively.

It didn’t translate to an NBA 

contract, but Morgan did earn 
a contract with L’Hermine de 
Nantes Atlantique of the French 
Professional B League this season.

He also kicked off his founda-

tion, The Jordan Morgan Foun-
dation, which aims to “provide 
education, support and encourage-
ment to today’s youth so that each 
individual has the opportunity to 
overcome any circumstance.”
