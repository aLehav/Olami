The 
Senate 
Advisory 

Committee 
on 
University 

Affairs met Monday evening 
to discuss working rights 
of 
graduate 
students 
on 

visas 
and 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan’s 
policy 
on 

transgender bathroom rights.

The committee was joined 

by 
Interim 
Provost 
Paul 

Courant 
and 
John 
Ware, 

president of the Graduate 
Employees’ Organization at 
the University, who reached 
out to SACUA for support 
in 
the 
GEO’s 
fight 
for 

increased working rights. The 
conversation began with a 
statement from Ware, asking 
for support from SACUA in his 
organization’s 
negotiations 

with Human Resources at the 
University for a new three-
year contract.

The 
GEO’s 
principal 

concern has to do with the 
number of hours graduate 
student 
instructors 
are 

permitted 
to 
work 
each 

week. As Ware explained to 
SACUA, students on certain 
visas — including the F-1 visa, 
which 30 percent of graduate 
students are on — can work 
a maximum of 20 paid hours 
per week during the academic 
term.

“The important issue is 

the fluctuations,” Ware said. 
“Typically, how that happens 
is there’s some more intense 

period of work during the 
term. For example, there’s 
an exam, some assignment 
due, and there’s a desire 
for that to be graded and 
turned around quickly, so 
there’s some work to do in 
the week following that. And 
that presents a problem for 
international GSIs, because 
our current contract allows 
their supervisors to ask them 
to work in a way which puts 

them in violation of their 
visas.”

According to Ware, the 

GEO would like this 20-hour 
restriction to be applied to all 
GSIs, not only those on visas. 
The committee broke into a 
discussion of whether it was 
fair to extend the regulation 
to all GSIs. David Wright, 
SACUA member and Ross 
School of Business professor, 
began 
by 
expressing 
his 

worries about the policy.

“I’m 
always 
a 
little 

concerned when we impose 
a 
regulation 
on 
everyone 

that only affects 30 percent,” 
Wright said. “By definition, 
we’ll be putting a constraint 
on the 70 percent which can’t 
work in their favor, because 
unregulated is always better 
than regulated.”

Ware responded to Wright’s 

In recent years, researchers 

have discovered certain genetic 
mutations 
are 
now 
linked 

with serious diseases in men, 
including prostate cancer. These 
genetic mutations, referred to 
as BRCA1 and BRCA2, were 
previously 
thought 
solely 
to 

increase a patient’s risk of breast 
cancer. This recent discovery has 
prompted doctors at Michigan 
Medicine, formerly the University 
of Michigan Health System, and 
specifically urological surgeon 
Todd Morgan, to develop the 
Prostate Cancer Risk Clinic — the 
first of its kind.

In 2012, the U.S. Preventive 

Services Task Force, a group 
of national experts that gives 
recommendations about clinical 
preventive 
services, 
gave 

the 
existing 
prostate 
cancer 

screening a grade D.

“The 
U.S. 
Preventive 

Services Task Force (USPSTF) 
recommends against prostate-
specific 
antigen 
(PSA)-based 

screening for prostate cancer,” 
the 
recommendation 
read, 

advising against the blood test

Last week, the Mackinac 

Center for Public Policy filed a 
lawsuit against the University 
of 
Michigan 
regarding 
the 

state’s Freedom of Information 
Act, claiming the University 
failed to provide the documents 
requested within due time.

On Nov. 16, Derek Draplin, 

a reporter with the Mackinac 
Center’s 
Michigan 
Capitol 

Confidential media outlet, issued 
the request on behalf of the 
nonprofit Michigan corporation 
to release University President 
Mark 
Schlissel’s 
emails 

containing the word “Trump” 
from July 1 to Nov. 16 of 2016. 

In the aftermath of the 

presidential election, Schlissel 
released a statement endorsing 
University-sponsored 
events 

that aimed to provide resources 
and information for students 
who felt heavily impacted by 
the election results to gather 
and share ideas. One event was 
a vigil at which Schlissel spoke, 
encouraging advocacy among 
those who did not support the 
election results.

Students, professors evaluate LSA Race 

and Ethnicity course requirement 

DESIGN BY NOAH SHERBIN

Faculty look to adjust R&E classes to address post-election political climate, review occurred in earliest days of presidential campaign

LSA junior Ryan Gillcrist, 

academic 
affairs 
committee 

chair 
for 
LSA 
Student 

Government, has taken three 
Race 
and 
Ethnicity 
classes 

before this semester, but he said 
the one he is enrolled in right 
now feels a little different than 
the others.

“When I took classes first 

year and second year … I mainly 
thought about issues of racism 

and intolerance in the context 
of the courses themselves,” 
Gillcrist said. “But I think 
that, especially in this political 
climate, I’ve started to think of 
the classes more in the context 
of the present.”

The current national and 

campus climate in wake of 
actions by President Donald 
Trump which have draw focus 
on issues relating to race and 
ethnicity. Both this semester 
and last, the University of 
Michigan has faced racist and 
anti-Semitic 
posters 
across 

campus and emails sent to 
students in multiple academic 
programs. Before, anti-Muslim 
chalkings covered the Diag.

In response to these issues, 

many students and faculty think 
the LSA Race and Ethnicity 
requirement — which has its 
roots in helping to solve similar 
situations — plays an important 
role in easing political tensions 
on campus this semester.

“I wonder what would’ve 

been going on if this was 
happening a year later.” 

Created in 1990 in response 

to demands from the student 
group Black Action Movement 
III, the Race and Ethnicity 
requirement 
has 
long 
been 

used to address complex social 
issues at the University. Since 
its conception, all LSA students 
have been required to take 
at least one R&E class before 
graduating, although many, like 
Gillcrist, end up taking several.

The 
requirement 
was 

reviewed for the second time 
in its history during the 2015-
2016 school year. The review 
committee, 
led 
by 
Angela 

Dillard, LSA associate dean of 
undergraduate education, took a 
critical look at the requirement 
and the way it contributes 
to students’ education. The 
committee 
made 
several 

recommendations, 
including 

smaller discussion sections for 
large R&E lectures.

“We 
periodically 
review 

all our degree requirements,” 
Dillard said. “For years, R&E 
has kind of been on the list 
of things to do. I had a huge 
interest in it, and the time 
seemed right.”

The 
review 
of 
the 

requirement 
occurred 
in 

the 
earliest 
days 
of 
the 

presidential campaign, before 
the 
University 
community 

knew how the outcome of the 
election would impact issues of 
race and ethnicity on campus. 
However, 
review 
committee 

member Holly Peters-Golden 
— who teaches Introduction to 
Anthropology 101, one of the 
most popular classes students 
take to fulfill the requirement 
— 
does

A Newly Discovered 
1790 Detroit Map

WHAT: Brian Dunnigan, 
curator of maps at the Clements 
Library, will analyze and discuss 
a recent library acquisition of a 
manuscript plan of Detroit.

WHO: William Clements Library

WHEN: Noon to 1:30 p.m.

WHERE: William Clements 
Library

Over 50 students and faculty 

gathered 
Monday 
afternoon 

at the University of Michigan 
International Institute for a panel 
discussing the struggle between 
democracy and corruption, as well 
as climate change, in the Maldive 
Islands and worldwide.

Before 
the 
event 
began, 

the documentary “The Island 
President,” which explored then-
President Mohamed Nasheed’s 
struggle 
against 
the 
political 

powers and the rising sea levels 
in the Maldives, was screened. 
Nasheed came to Ann Arbor as a 
featured speaker, explaining his 
ongoing aspirations as a political 
activist for human rights and 
combating climate change.

The panel began by detailing his 

experience, including his chaotic 
administration 
and 
numerous 

arrests. His most recent arrest, 
which has lasted thirteen years 
and resulted in his seeking asylum 
in order to escape the authoritarian 
political regime in the Maldives, 
is due to his involvement with 
politics.

“There is a lot of work to do 

before we can start living a more 
happy life in the Maldives,” he 
said, explaining how his more 
democratic views were challenged 
and then later used against him 
by his rivals. “I just couldn’t 
confess. And I couldn’t capitulate. 
I couldn’t give myself to the state.”

Nasheed 
became 
the 
first 

democratically-elected president 
of the Maldives in 2008, after 
his consistent work in peaceful 
activism against the government. 
He was forced to resign and was 
put in prison in 2012 after a coup 
by a group of individuals that was 

loyal to the former president.

He shared with the crowd that 

he plans to run for president again 
in 2018.

Nasheed’s 
lawyer, 
Jared 

Genser, a UM Law School alum, 
has been heavily involved with 
human rights. In particular, his 
organization, 
Freedom 
Now, 

has worked to free prisoners of 
conscience who hold politically 
charged views.

Their paths crossed while 

Nasheed was imprisoned in the 
Maldives — Genser worked on 
his case and aided in his eventual 
release in 2016 to the United 
Kingdom, where Nasheed was 
granted 
asylum 
and 
medical 

treatment.

“Having been involved with 

this work for more than 16 years, 
what I find most remarkable is that 
freedom is a universal value across 
all cultures,” he said.

Panel 
member 
Rebecca 

Hardin, associate professor in 
the School of Natural Resources 
and 
Environment, 
praised 

Nasheed’s motives for activism. 
She stated his life changed her 
own perspective as an American 
citizen, emphasizing the growing 
relevance of Nasheed’s case to in 
political atmosphere of the United 
States today.

“We are listening to you in 

some ways as a mentor,” she said. 
“I think that changes the energy 
that we can find between where 
you are sitting, where you’ve been, 
your journey and the one that 
many of us now feel that we are 
beginning in earnest for the first 
time in our own country and its 
relationships pulling away from 
multilateralism.”

The top of climate change 

dominated the remainder of the 
panel discussion, with a distinct 
emphasis 
on 
the 
connection 

between Nasheed’s work in the 
Maldives and the methods he uses 
to battle climate change globally.

Although the Ford Field LED 

display and LED streetlights 

in Detroit were heralded as 

achievements of innovation and 

safety, the light pollution they 

produce could cause the city some 

problems.

The LED streetlights, which 

were installed in December, were 

described by Mayor Mike Duggan 

as a “sign of hope” for the city’s 

rebirth, but despite all the attention 

they received, little conversation 

surrounded their adverse effects. 

One of the more perceptible losses, 

starry nights, has been disheartening 

for many, including Charles Nielsen, 

president of the University Lowbrow 

Astronomers Club in Ann Arbor.

“There would have been a time 

that even in downtown Ann Arbor, 

you would have been able to see 

the Milky Way,” Nielsen said in an 

interview with the Detroit Free Press. 

“You have to get to a fairly dark site 

now to see it.”

The light pollution could have 

ecological effects as well, as evidence 

suggests that large-scale deaths in 

bird and insect populations have 

occurred because of the influx of 

blue-toned light. Additionally, the 

internal clock of the human body 

needs darkness to function, but 

the prevalence of screens and LED 

fixtures makes darkness is a rarity.

John Barentine, program 

manager for the International Dark 

Sky Association, told the Detroit Free 

Press, these large-scale changes are 

not unprecedented.

“Like in many other ways, as 

humanity, we have caused great, 

landscape-scale changes to the world, 

particularly in the last century or 

so,” Barentine said. “One of the ways 

is, we’ve fundamentally altered the 

nighttime landscape through the use 

of artificial light. That has so many 

impacts, and it goes beyond just being 

able to see stars in the night sky.”

The Ford Field light display, 

which cast a purple glow in the 

Detroit sky, faced many complaints 

about light pollution, prompting a 

petition that received over 1,200 

signatures. The chief complaint was 

that the multi-million dollar display 

was not productive, causing major 

light pollution with no benefit other 

than its aesthetics. The light show 

was dimmed down in response.

Christopher Kyba, a scientist 

at the German Research Center for 

Geoscience in Potsdam, told the 

Detroit Free Press the goal of 

decreasing light pollution is simply to 

make it productive.

“The goal with all of these things 

is not to make things dark; it’s to have 

the right light, in the right place, at 

the right time,” Kyba said.

that had been used to screen for 
prostate cancer.

The USPSTF recommendation 

took prostate cancer screening 
out of the hands of primary care 
physicians, causing a drop in 
overall screenings for prostate 
cancer. This reality frightened 
Morgan and others in the medical 
field who worked specifically 
with patients with the disease

“A lot of us who take care of 

men with prostate cancer got 
really worried that this could lead 
to a significant rise in prostate 
cancer and men dying of (it),” 
Morgan said. “So there’s been a lot 
of thought about what we can do 
to prevent that from happening.” 

His eventual solution was to 

create the Prostate Cancer Risk 
Clinic at Michigan Medicine, 
which will open on March 15, to 
regularly screen patients with 
a genetic predisposition to the 
BRCA mutation or any other 
mutation that increases the risk 
of prostate cancer. Three doctors 
will work at the clinic. 

The PCRC’s website lists the 

cancer-related mutations which 
should prompt the scheduling of 
an appointment with the clinic. 
Besides the BRCA mutation, 
the 
clinic 
recommends 
that 

patients who tested positive for 
Lynch syndrome, Li-Fraumeni 
syndrome and a host of other 
mutations should schedule an 
appointment.

“The PCRC is intended for 

men with these mutations in 
order to initiate an individualized 

prostate cancer screening plan 
and follow-up care,” the clinic’s 
website reads.

One area that doctors are still 

working on is ensuring men know 
to get tested for the specified 
mutations. 

“Recommendations are totally 

vague still,” Morgan said. “There 
are a handful of recommendations 
that are still out there, but nothing 
that is broadly accepted.”

Morgan 
explained 
that 

patients who know they have 
Lynch 
syndrome, 
who 
have 

sisters or mothers with a history 
of ovarian, breast or pancreatic 
cancer or who have brothers or 
fathers who were diagnosed with 
aggressive prostate cancer will 
be more likely to go to genetic 
clinics to be tested. Morgan and 
his team are still working on ways 
to create more specific guidelines 
to encourage patients to receive 
genetic tests. 

“Over time we expect to move 

from just taking care of these 

patients with known mutations, 
to honing recommendations to 
see which men should get the 
genetic condition,” Morgan said. 

Clinics 
exist 
around 
the 

country to work with patients 
with the BRCA mutation to 
mitigate the risks of breast 
cancer. The PCRC, however, will 
be the first clinic with the sole 
goal of helping men between the 
ages of 35 and 70 without a prior 
diagnosis of prostate cancer but 
with a mutation putting them at 
risk.

If a patient is found to have a 

prostate cancer-related mutation, 
they will receive screening every 
year to reduce the risk of late 
diagnosis.

“The goal is primarily to detect 

more aggressive prostate cancers 
earlier when they are more 
treatable,” Morgan said. 

Morgan hopes early detection 

and follow-up care will lower 
the death rate of prostate cancer, 
which is currently the second 
leading cause of cancer deaths 
among men in the United States. 

In 
addition 
to 
annual 

screenings, men will be asked 
to discuss with their doctors 
anything that might be putting 
them 
at 
a 
greater 
risk 
of 

developing the cancer.

Morgan said he and his team 

are confident the creation of 
this clinic is an effective step in 
working to reduce late diagnosis 
of aggressive prostate cancer. 
The opening of the Prostate 
Cancer Risk Clinic at Michigan 
Medicine will allow for an 
increased prevention for prostate 
cancer, 
in 
turn 
preventing 

deaths.

committee would have changed 
its recommendations if it could 
have foreseen the impact of the 
election.

“I really don’t think that 

was on our radar screen when 
we were doing this,” Peters-
Golden said. “I wonder what 
would’ve been going on if this 
was happening a year later. But 
we didn’t need this particular 
election to get those of us on 
the committee to think about 
how there are all sorts of things 
going on. One of the things that 
is important in 101 is to look at 
the fact that these issues are 
not new issues.”

“You’re not asking them to 

agree or disagree with it, but 
simply understand it.” 

Aside from the presentation 

of 
issues 
surrounding 
race 

and ethnicity, some think the 
reason R&E classes can help 
ease tension is the platform for 
discussion they provide.

American 
Culture 
Prof. 

Matthew Countryman is on 
leave this school year, but 
he has regularly taught R&E 
classes in the past. According 
to 
Countryman, 
each 
R&E 

class has two aspects: first, the 
introduction to information, 

and second, a discussion about 
how that information relates to 
the students’ lives.

“There’s some information 

about what race is and what 
it isn’t, what the role that it’s 
played historically in American 
society, and the intellectual 
condition of racial inquiry,” 
Countryman 
said. 
“You’re 

not asking them to agree or 
disagree with it, but simply 
understand 
it. 
The 
second 

aspect is to then have students 
share with each other their 
own ideas and perspectives and 
hear from people other than 
themselves to understand how 
… differences in identity shape 
different experiences within 
the U.S. and our culture.”

Countryman 
said 
the 

discussions do not always come 
naturally to his students, but 
once they’ve made it past the 
initial awkwardness, he and his 
students find them rewarding.

“In all the classes, when it 

goes well it’s really the most 
exciting teaching I do,” he said. 
“Race is sort of the ultimate 
taboo. Students are nervous to 
talk … (But) when they feel like 
there’s an environment where 
there isn’t a wrong thing to say, 
but rather the opportunity to 
share with one another, there’s 
a real desire to understand 
and to think about what it 

means to grow up in Detroit 
versus the U.P. versus southern 
California.”

In 
addition 
to 
helping 

students 
learn 
to 
better 

understand their classmates, 
LSA senior Marjai Kamara, 
who also served on the R&E 
review committee, thinks part 
of the reason R&E can have so 
much impact on the University 
community is the way it utilizes 
the safe space of the classroom.

“Most people have been in 

school for a long time and they 
know how classes navigate,” 
she said. “I think it’s a relatively 
OK, safe-ish space for people, 
so hopefully engaging with 
those ideas and things in a 
classroom can be a good place 
to start thinking and engaging 
with them in the first place.”

“By itself, the requirement 

doesn’t do anything but put 
people in seats.” 

Others are broaching the 

political topics of R&E classes 
in a subtler way. American 
Studies Prof. Sandra Gunning 
has taught American Culture 
201 for years, but, like Gillcrist, 
found herself approaching the 
class in a different way this 
semester.

“I find myself since the 

election 
being 
even 
more 

cautious,” Gunning said. “In 
other American culture courses 

with majority white students, 
people are like ‘my friend who 
supports 
Trump 
is 
feeling 

victimized,’ so I don’t want 
people to feel alienated in any 
way. Before, I would play news 
clips to explain something, but 
now I don’t even bother with 
that. We still see clips but I try 
to find other examples from 
just basic culture. And I have 
never used the word ‘Trump’ — 
I don’t intend to.” 

Gunning feels the point of her 

class — and of the requirement 
— is to present students with 
information about race and 
ethnicity and let them come 
to their own conclusions. She 
focuses on teaching the issues 
rather 
than 
the 
positions 

anyone holds about them.

“If taught properly and if 

taught self-consciously, where 
you make it clear that it’s 
not a brainwashing session 
… it can help students think 
more clearly and with more 
information about whatever the 
hot-button issues are,” she said. 
“For example, I was teaching 
(about how racial categories 
are a cultural construction) and 
one of the (Graduate Student 
Instructors) reported that they 
had a student say ‘I’m not ready 
yet to let go of those racial 
categories.’ To me, that means 
the course succeeded. I don’t 

need to have them say ‘yes, 
you’re right,’ I just need to have 
them think about it.”

Still others see the role of the 

requirement as much more of 
a starting point. Because R&E 
classes are required of all LSA 
students, not everyone comes to 
them with the same mindset. 

Countryman 
stressed 
the 

role of the R&E requirement as 
a portal to other conversations 
and actions, rather than a 
complete solution.

“By itself, the requirement 

doesn’t do anything but put 
people in seats,” Countryman 
said. “But it gives us the 
opportunity 
to 
create 

educational 
spaces 
that 

allow for a more in-depth 
exploration of these issues than 
the comments section of the 
newspaper or wherever else.”

“There 
are 
absolutely 

connections people can make.” 

Faculty involved in Race and 

Ethnicity classes recognizes 
they 
are 
not 
perfect, 
and 

still have a long way to go. 
According 
to 
Dillard, 
the 

recommendations 
made 
by 

the 
review 
committee 
are 

still in the process of being 
implemented, 
but 
budgetary 

constraints prevent some of 
them from happening.

“Trying 
to 
decrease 
the 

(discussion) section sizes is 

enormously expensive, and we 
don’t know how in the world we 
can pay for it across the board,” 
Dillard said. “So we’re running 
a few experiments in American 
culture and trying to figure out 
how to do that on a budget.”

Other people would like more 

resources to help students and 
teachers digest the sometimes 
unpleasant topics these classes 
include, or stricter guidelines 
on what the classes should 
cover. While Dillard said no 
one wanted to abolish the 
requirement at the time of the 
review, she also conceded that 
changes will need to be made.

Through his position as an 

officer in LSA SG, Gillcrist 
has tackled many of the issues 
surrounding R&E firsthand. 
But to him, regardless of the 
changes to come — or the 
changes in the ways people 
approach their topics — the role 
of R&E classes in this political 
climate remains important and 
constant.

“There are a lot of students 

who 
haven’t 
seen 
certain 

perspectives 
before, 
and 
I 

think that through the R&E 
requirement, they’re able to,” 
he said. “I think that there are 
absolutely connections people 
can make, and see how people 
in the past have addressed 
issues related to intolerance.”

comments, by stating the GEO 
felt applying the restrictions 
to only international students 
would 
actually 
be 
more 

detrimental to the rest of the 
GSI community.

“I think actually that, if we 

impose the regulation only on 
the 30 percent, that’s to the 
disadvantage of the 70 percent, 
because the additional work 
in peak periods will be shifted 
onto them,” Ware said.

Courant 
spoke 
up 
next, 

voicing his own concerns for 
how the new regulations would 
affect undergraduate students.

“Just speaking as a humble 

schoolteacher, 
I’m 
a 
little 

worried about the effect of all 
of this on the undergraduates 
who are taking these courses, 
because the natural rhythm of 
the course is not that there’s 
an equal amount of work to be 
done on the instruction side 
every week,” Courant said.

The committee did not come 

to a decision on whether or not 
to support the GEO’s desire 
to create a 20-hour-per-week 
maximum for all GSIs, feeling 
they did not have enough 

time to fully discuss the issue 
and draft a statement. They 
did, however, recognize this 
issue as one that prevails all 
throughout academia, and is 
not unique to the University.

The 
conversation 
then 

turned to a discussion of 
what should be included in 
the 
University’s 
policy 
on 

transgender bathroom laws. 
Committee members discussed 
whether the University should 
focus on creating more unisex 
bathrooms or issue a statement 
saying students, faculty and 
staff are free to use whichever 
bathroom matches their gender 
identity.

SACUA 
member 
Silke-

Maria Weineck, a professor 
of 
German 
studies 
and 

comparative 
literature, 

stressed the importance of 
supporting 
the 
transgender 

members of the University 
community by issuing a formal 
statement.

“I’d be very happy in a 

world where all bathrooms 
are unisex, but I think we’re 
not quite there yet, and I 
think 
for 
those 
members 

of our community who are 
transgender, it would mean a 
great deal to have an official 
statement from the University 
saying ‘use whatever damn 

bathroom you want,’ ” Weineck 
said. “I think our current 
practice is use whatever … 
bathroom you want, but that’s 
how we act, and I think to put 
it in writing would be a good 
thing to do.”

The topic was tabled while 

the 
committee 
dealt 
with 

other administrative matters. 
When they returned to the 
issue at the end of the meeting, 
members 
brought 
up 
the 

statement issued by Oberlin 
College, supporting students’ 
choices to use the bathroom 
of their choice. Wright felt the 
committee should adopt the 
language used by Oberlin in 
its policy, and the rest of the 
members agreed.

“I’m surprised we don’t have 

a policy, frankly, and one way to 
do it … is to essentially adopt the 
Oberlin language here,” Wright 
said. “Just make the policy that 
all members of the campus 
community are free to use the 
restroom that is consistent with 
their gender identity.”

SACUA 
made 
slight 

modifications 
to 
the 

language used by Oberlin, but 
unanimously agreed on a policy 
that allows all members of the 
campus community to use the 
bathroom of the gender with 
which they identify.

There are a 
handful of 

recommendations 
that are still out 
there, but nothing 

that is broadly 

accepted

Schlissel’s public response 

to 
the 
contentious 
2016 

election cycle was received 
by 
overwhelming 
backlash 

from over 380 students and 
alumni who signed a petition 
condemning the University’s 
response to President Donald 
Trump’s 
victory, 
claiming 

that 
the 
University 
was 

“perpetuating a hateful climate 
that 
makes 
students 
feel 

ashamed for voting for Donald 
Trump.”

The 
requested 
emails 

would have provided insight 
into 
Schlissel’s 
actions 
and 

the details of the University’s 
response to the emotionally 
charged election cycle.

In a news release by the 

Mackinac Center, John Mozena, 
vice president for marketing 
and communications, expressed 
how Schissel’s response was 
problematic.

“In his professional role as 

head of a public university, 
President Schlissel took a very 
public stance against President-
Elect Trump and the people 
who 
elected 
him,” 
Mozena 

said. “Our CapCon team was 
interested in learning more 
about 
the 
decision-making 

process that led to the actions 
taken by this public university 
and its employee, and filed the 
FOIA request accordingly.”

Michigan’s open records law 

requires government agencies 
and public institutions such as 
the University, to respond to 
requests within five business 
days. 
However, 
through 
a 

series of articles in the FOIA 
that 
permit 
and 
outline 

circumstances for the deferment 

of requests, the request kept 
getting delayed.

In 
an 
email 
written 
by 

University 
FOIA 
Specialist 

Shannon 
Molen, 
the 
initial 

response to the request stated 
that, due to the high number 
of appeals, the FOIA Office 
cannot respond within the five-
day period as required by the 
FOIA and referenced a clause 
in the act that permits a 10-day 
extension to respond to requests 
and ensured the response would 
be delivered on or before Dec. 
12.

On the final day of the 

extension, Patricia Sellinger, 
chief Freedom of Information 
officer, 
responded 
to 
the 

reporter in a letter outlining the 
$126 total cost for the request 
and a good-faith deposit of half 
the total amount, as allotted by 
clauses in the FOIA, in order to 
complete the request. She also 
issued a new estimate of four 
weeks to complete the request 
once the deposit was cashed.

Through 
several 
emails 

inquiring about the status of 
his request, Draplin was first 
given an estimate of completion 
by Jan. 24. Draplin was given a 
later estimate of within 10 days, 
being told again the office was 
processing a high volume of 
requests and could not meet its 
original estimate to process in 
late January.

On the final day of the latest 

estimate, a letter by Sellinger 
requested the remainder of the 
total fees in order to complete 
the request and issue the four 
emails found to match his 
request. 

When the final payment was 

processed by the University on 
Feb. 23, the Mackinac Center 
still received no documents per 
its request.

After announcing the lawsuit 

on March 2, the Mackinac 
Center received the documents, 
a few days after the University 
processed 
the 
payment, 

containing four of Schlissel’s 
emails in the mail. Since the 
University’s FOIA Office took 
106 days to provide the emails, 
however, the Mackinac Center 
is still pursuing the lawsuit. 

In a news release issued 

by 
the 
Mackinac 
Center, 

Patrick 
Wright, 
director 
of 

the Mackinac Center Legal 
Foundation, 
discussed 
the 

nature of the lawsuit and quoted 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
in doing so.

“To 
borrow 
a 
phrase 

from 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan’s football coach, the 
Mackinac Center will fight for 
governmental 
transparency 

‘with an enthusiasm unknown 
to mankind,’ ” Wright said. “The 
documents are important, but 
at this point, it’s really about 
the delay. People and the press 
have a right to information no 
matter how embarrassing or 
inconvenient it might be to the 
public officials involved.”

Wright also reasoned the 

simplicity required thereof to 
perform the tasks requested by 
the FOIA Office.

“This was a simple request,” 

Wright said. “Any of us could 
find the relevant documents in 
30 seconds with a simple word 
search in our sent email folder. 
There is no reason it should take 
over 100 days for the University 
of Michigan to follow the law.”

University 
spokesman 

Rick 
Fitzgerald 
issued 
an 

updated statement regarding 
the 
situation 
iterating 
the 

University has done nothing 
wrong.

I

’ve been having a lot of 
conversations lately about 
what I’m going to do after 

I graduate. At this 
point, my response 
is like a reflex: “I’m 
not sure where I’m 
working yet, but I’m 
applying to entry-
level production jobs 
at broadcast news 
networks 
in 
New 

York City.” If I had a 
nickel for every time 
I said some rough 
iteration 
of 
that 

sentence, I’d have a 
lot of unused nickels 
lying around my house. (Why 
are nickels still a currency?)

Slowly, 
though, 
my 

conversations about life after 
graduation are becoming less 
hypothetical. 
Spring 
Break 

marks the semester’s halfway 
point — and just a few days 
ago, I officially applied for 
graduation. The end is near 
(cue 
stomach 
ulcer), 
and 

though I feel ready to get out 
there, work and embrace life as 
a member of the so-called “real 
world,” I’m also suffering from 
crippling waves of nostalgia 
and anxiety. 

I’ve been trying to figure 

out when Ann Arbor became 
a second home and not just 
the city where I take classes. I 
think it started when I agreed 
to live with my roommates — 
Matt and Casey — toward the 
beginning of sophomore year. 
Matt’s nursing rotations and 
course load made it virtually 
impossible for him to come 
tour houses, so Casey and I 
resorted to walking the streets 
of Kerrytown, going door to 
door and asking students to 
see their homes. That’s how we 
found the place we live now. We 
saw it once. There wasn’t even a 
“For Rent” sign out front. It was 
just lucky. When we put down 
the deposit, Matt hadn’t even 
seen the apartment.

The promise of living in 

our house junior year got 
the “home” vibe rolling at an 
otherwise difficult time. I’ve 
written about this before — 
sophomore year was hard for 
me. I felt isolated. I couldn’t 
find the motivation to do 
practically anything. I didn’t 
like the classes I was taking. I 
felt trapped in my dorm, where 
I had to enter a code to use the 
bathroom. Without a doubt, 
I reveled in the support of 
friendships when everything 
else was so frustrating. I 
appreciated that there were 
people who I cared about and 
who cared about me right back. 
That helped.

But Ann Arbor really started 

to feel more like a home when 
we moved into our house. 
We gained a great deal of 
responsibility, the three of us. 
We had to pay rent, electricity 
bills and cable bills. It was 
the first time any of us had to 
do that. Since then, we’ve all 
gained a better understanding 

of what it means to handle 
our own finances responsibly. 
I overdrew a debit card for 

the 
first 
time 

and 
learned 
to 

regularly 
check 

bank statements to 
make sure I have 
enough funds before 
mindlessly spending 
on things I don’t 
need.

We had to wash 

our 
own 
dishes 

instead 
of 
letting 

them pile up in the 
sink (cough, Casey, 

cough). We had to do our 

own grocery shopping and cook 
our own meals instead of swiping 
into dining halls. This was huge. 
It’s become a meaningful ritual 
in our house, and few things are 
more satisfying than parading our 
brown bags full of provisions up 
the steps. I recently made a joke 
to Casey that our elation when 
we return from Trader Joe’s must 
parallel the emotions of hunter-
gatherers returning with animal 
carcasses and vegetables.

We started going to Mr. 

Stadium Coin Laundry & Dry 
Cleaning to wash our clothes, 
because our unit doesn’t have 
a washer or dryer. I learned 
that detergent pods are best 
put at the bottom of a top-
loading 
washing 
machine 

— otherwise they might not 
disintegrate 
properly 
and 

could 
inconveniently 
leave 

sticky residue on my clothes. 
Ultimately, 
I 
learned 
that 

liquid detergent is superior to 
its pod cousin.

Living 
in 
Kerrytown 

meant strolling around the 
neighborhood and exploring 
the areas where not only 
students but also real Ann 
Arbor 
residents 
live. 
We 

constantly take walks — one 
friend recently compared us 
to 65-year-old men. One of our 
favorite routes, among others: 
meander down to Depot Street 
near the train tracks, across 
from the dog park (yup, there’s 
a dog park), through the human 
park, past Casey’s Tavern (a 
real place, we have coasters), 
back 
up 
Main 
Street 
and 

around toward our home again.

I suppose Ann Arbor started 

feeling even more like home 
once 
the 
novelty 
of 
each 

household activity gave way 
to established routines. Doing 
chores in our home is like 
clockwork now. Our collective 

comfort while cooking in the 
kitchen has made it fun to 
invite friends (whether it’s one 
or 14) over for dinner. Our trips 
to the laundromat are reliably 
three hours on the dot; it’s not 
infrequent that we head over to 
Benny’s Family Dining for solid 
diner food while our clothes are 
in the dryer, and it’s common 
knowledge at this point that 
I take the longest to fold 
afterward (I’m very particular).

Ann Arbor feels like home 

because 
it’s 
not 
foreign 

anymore. I’ve talked with my 
dad, a University of Michigan 
alum, about this before. You can 
probably imagine where you 
grew up in great detail. What 
does your block look like? I bet 
you can see every house. How 
do you get to your best friend’s 
place? You could recount the 
exact routes and street names, 
imagine the scenery. What 
does home smell like? It’s hard 
to describe, but you know it. 
We all do. When I first got 
here, I couldn’t answer those 
questions about Ann Arbor. 
But now that this experience is 
coming to a close, I’ve come to 
realize that whenever I’m not 
here, my vision of Ann Arbor is 
as crisp and precise as my vision 
of home back in Los Angeles.

Now, I have the same fears 

I had when I left home for 
Michigan in 2013. Previous 
concerns about not going to 
school with my best friends 
have been replaced with the 
knowledge that I’m not going 
to work in the same city as 
many of those who are part of 
my Ann Arbor family — they’ll 
be spread all over the country. 
I’m likely not going to live in 
the city where I grew up, and 
I have mixed feelings about 
continuing to live so far away 
from my family. I still don’t 
have long-term certainty about 
what my future has in store, 
nor do most of us. And all of 
this is compounded by the fact 
that in a month and a half, I 
won’t have official, school-
sanctioned breaks to reliably 
convene with the people I care 
about in a central location. The 
things that I do in a workplace 
are going to start having 
consequences beyond a letter 
grade and grade point average.

So, it’s all going to test 

whether or not this experiment 
of living on my own with 
two buddies in a funky little 
subdivided 
apartment 
in 

Kerrytown as a student was 
successful preparation. One 
of my grandparents calls this 
kind of thing a “passage.” It’s 
like growing pains between an 
old phase and a new one, and 
though it’s not comfortable, 
it’s 
necessary. 
All 
things 

considered, then, I’m ready 
and raring to get out there into 
a world beyond this college 
campus. But I’ll miss it dearly.

A

buzz from my phone 
used to mean a new 
text message or email 

notification, but these 
days every time I 
reach for my phone 
I am greeted with a 
news 
alert,. 
where 

the 
name 
Donald 

Trump 
never 
fails 

to be included. Since 
the inauguration, the 
Trump administration 
has 
been 
closely 

reported, 
its 
each 

and 
every 
move 

serving as the centerpiece of 
daily headlines, both domestic 
and international. Every day 
of the 45th presidency means 
a slew of new stories depicting 
the continued unconventionality 
of the country’s leader. In other 
words, every day feels like we’re 
waiting to see what Trump does 
next, and we can depend on the 
press to always keep us updated. 
Yet, given his personality, he isn’t 
taking this too well. 

The question of government 

transparency has long been a 
question without an answer. How 
much does the public get to know? 
How much should the public 
know? How much do we actually 
know? Holding political leaders 
and administrations accountable 
for their actions is only possible 
when we actually get to see their 
actions. Yet, our power in lifting 
the veil on the government can 
only go so far. Instead, the news is 
our vital way of being and staying 
informed, making sure our leaders 
take 
responsibility 
for 
their 

actions. Those who have power to 
make change, both good and bad, 
have people and communities to 
answer to. The arrival of a Trump 
administration 
has 
recently 

threatened that idea.

What began as an irritability 

with The New York Times, 
Trump’s dislike of the press — or 
rather dislike of his bad press — 
has escalated. After a series of 
tweets referring to reputable news 
organizations as “FAKE NEWS” 
and a disastrous White House 
Press briefing, it is safe to say that 
the Trump-press relationship is 

unconventional at least. While the 
press may not always have the best 
relationship with the government, 

past 
administrations 

kept it cordial with 
the press corps. The 
new 
president 
and 

his 
administration, 

continuing the trend 
of 
unconventionality, 

have 
taken 
White 

House-press relations 
in a new direction.

Two 
weeks 
ago, 

the strained relations 
culminated 
in 
the 

barring of certain news outlets 
from a White House briefing. 
The act was uncalled for and, 
in my opinion, un-presidential. 
While left-leaning publications 
may be more critical of the 
administration and thus be an 
unfavorable 
attendance 
for 

Trump, the exclusion extended 
to more conservative publications 
as well. This marks a highly 
unconventional approach to public 
relations in the White House. 
Simply dubbing any news that is 
unfavorable or tainting as “fake” 
is not only a sure sign of disregard 
for the First Amendment, but a 
sign of weakness.

This defensive stance on the 

press is not a warranted one, and 
as Trump continues his war on 
the press, his credibility as a strong 
and truthful leader disintegrates. 
I will admit, the press has been 
more frequent in their reporting 
of the new presidency than in 
past presidencies, but the fear and 
uncertainty of the people who 
followed the news about Trump 
from the campaign trail into the 
White House means we need the 
press now more than ever. 

In the past month, Trump has 

shown he isn’t slow to get to work. 
The New York Times published an 
insightful infographic grouping 
the 
administration’s 
recent 

actions on a scale from abnormal 
to normal and important to not 
important. Not surprisingly, the 
majority of events were rated as 
abnormal and important. (It is also 
important to note these ratings 
were 
conducted 
by 
panelists 

across the ideological spectrum.) 

The presidency’s willingness to 
make important and widespread 
change means a higher need for 
transparency from the people but 
a likely unwillingness from the 
administration to provide it.

The Trump administration’s 

barring of news corps from a 
briefing and his own deeming of 
press as the enemy of the American 
people threatens the institution 
that 
fights 
for 
government 

transparency. There already exists 
a disconnect between people and 
the government, but turning on 
the news, picking up the paper 
or reading articles online is what 
lessens that disconnect. If we 
are not informed, we cannot 
hold our leaders accountable. If 
Trump continues actions which 
undermine the means of informing 
the people, he is actively working 
against 
a 
more 
transparent 

government. 
While 
Trump’s 

difficult relationship with the press 
started during his campaign, now 
as a president with ample power, 
his relationship with the press is 
not just between the press and him, 
but the American people as well.

The lens we see our government 

through is only enhanced and made 
clearer by a strong and willful press 
corps. Sure, the constant coverage 
of the Trump administration 
can be annoying and the daily 
news alerts or shared articles on 
Facebook are getting old; however, 
Trump’s rhetoric against the press 
means being informed and seeking 
accountability is more important 
now than ever. It also means 
supporting the journalists who 
are, despite adversity, seeking the 
truth by any means possible. The 
new administration’s straying from 
political norms has manifested 
as actions that compromise basic 
tenets of people’s relationships 
with their officials. Trump’s war 
on the press — his thorough and 
daily dissatisfaction with reporting 
— is only a sign of the weakness 
of this administration and, more 
importantly, works against true 
government transparency.

MICHAEL 

SUGERMAN

W

e 
are 
a 
coalition 

of 
organizations 

committed 
to 

transforming the University of 
Michigan campus climate through 
policy change. We believe that the 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
strategic planning initiative will 
fail without financial investments 
into 
the 
infrastructure 
for 

DEI work: The current policy 
of expecting free labor from 
marginalized people undermines 
the integrity of the entire DEI 
campus enterprise.

Since 
the 
DEI 
strategic 

plans were released last fall, 
the University has repeatedly 
declared its aspirations for a truly 
diverse, equitable and inclusive 
campus environment. However, a 
recent decision by the University 
conflicts with this vision.

In 
December 
2016, 

the 
Graduate 
Employees’ 

Organization, the labor union 
representing Graduate Student 
Instructors and Graduate Student 
Staff Assistants, put forth a 
proposal to the University to create 
paid DEI positions for graduate 
students within each school unit. 
As part of negotiations for its 
labor contract, GEO proposed 
hiring at least one DEI GSSA per 
school unit at a 20-hours-a-week 
appointment, 
with 
additional 

positions at larger schools such 
as LSA and Engineering. These 
GSSA roles would substantially 
increase the capacity of each 
school unit to implement their 
DEI plans, and officially place 
value on the diversity labor 
and expertise contributed by 
graduate 
students. 
Moreover, 

GSSA positions dedicated to DEI 
work would lift much of the labor 
burden off of students, faculty and 
staff who have historically done 
this work on a voluntary basis. 
Paid GSSA positions would make 
it possible for the University to 
be proactive on campus climate 
issues, rather than reactive, and 
institutionalize DEI labor as core 
to campus operations.

In February, the University 

rejected that proposal. As part 
of 
negotiation 
proceedings 

between 
GEO 
and 
Academic 

Human Resources, HR flatly 
rejected GEO’s proposal to fund 
GSSA positions for DEI labor in 
each campus unit. This concerns 
undergraduate students, graduate 
students, 
staff 
and 
faculty 

alike. It sends a message to our 
communities that the University 
does not place a high value on DEI 
labor if it is unwilling to pay for it.

Recent campus events ranging 

from 
racist 
and 
anti-Semitic 

emails to white supremacist fliers 
have made it abundantly clear that 
now more than ever the University 
needs to take proactive measures 
and ensure that each school unit 
has the capacity to respond to acts 
of hate efficiently and effectively. 
Without paid DEI positions as part 
of the University infrastructure, 
school units will continue to 
struggle when responding to such 
incidents as they arise.

We call on the University to 

meaningfully 
integrate 
DEI 

labor into the structure of 
our institution by hiring and 
paying students to support 
the implementation of DEI 
plans. We specifically declare our 
endorsement of GEO’s proposal to 
create paid DEI graduate student 
staff positions. In doing so, we 
join the more than 900 students, 
faculty and staff who have signed a 
petition in support of the proposal. 
Several of our organizations have 
previously described the need for 
fair compensation for diversity 
labor and the importance of 
investing in human resources in 
order to address inequalities in the 
distribution of diversity labor on 
campus. There is clear and broad 
support for the creation of paid 
DEI positions.

Hiring GSSAs across school 

units 
would 
substantially 

increase 
staff 
capacity 
to 

implement DEI strategic plans. 
Most campus units have formed 
working groups and committees 
to begin the work of developing 
and implementing such plans. 
These advisory committees serve 
an important role in overseeing 
progress, but they are not equipped 
to carry out the day-to-day tasks 
involved in actual implementation. 
Those 
who 
serve 
on 
the 

committees do so voluntarily, 
and on top of their existing job 
duties, academic workload or both. 
Meetings held once a month or 
once a semester are not enough to 
promote systemic change within 
any campus unit. These facts 
coupled with the high turnover 
rate most committees experience, 
as students and faculty move on to 
serve other needs, can make DEI 
committees ineffective. Expecting 
school units to adhere to aggressive 
implementation timelines in the 
absence of paid staff dedicated to 
doing this work is both unrealistic 
and unsustainable. By hiring 
graduate students to support 
implementation activities, GEO’s 
proposal addresses the widespread 
capacity issues faced by diversity 
initiatives across campus.

Creating paid DEI positions 

would also harness valuable 
student expertise that has yet 
to be utilized through formal 
mechanisms. Students at the 
University have been successfully 
organizing 
around 
issues 
of 

race, gender and class for a long 
time. Leaders from across our 
organizations are routinely tapped 
as “on-the-ground” experts by 
administrators and asked to engage 
in diversity labor because of their 
knowledge of power dynamics 
and systems of oppression as 
they apply to University settings. 
In fact, many school-specific 
DEI plans tout the successes 
of student-led DEI efforts as 
their 
own. 
However, 
these 

students have largely engaged 
in 
diversity 
labor 
through 

informal channels, providing 
their recommendations on an 
unpaid basis to school officials 
who 
have 
limited 
expertise 

on issues related to race and 
inequality. Deans and chairs 
overwhelmingly 
hail 
from 

socially privileged groups and 
have not been tested on their 
qualifications to implement DEI 
plans effectively.

Kodie Shane is just eigh-

teen years-old — while she is 
seasoned enough to remember 
owning a Walkman and the 
self-titled Ashanti album on 
CD, she is still young enough 
for Lil Wayne’s Tha Carter IV 
to be the first album she paid 
for with her own money.

Nowadays, Shane pays for a 

lot with her own money.

“I’m about to go get me two 

iPhone Pluses ‘cause these too 
small,” she says, holding three 
recent models of the Apple 
smartphone, her eyes con-
stantly switching from screen 
to screen, while sitting back-
stage at the Loving Touch in 
Ferndale, MI, where we had a 
chance to chat during the tail-
end of the tour for her Zero 
Gravity EP.

Kodie Shane is tinier than 

you’d expect in person — small 
enough that “tiny” truly seems 
like a fitting word — but she 
has grand dreams and a roar-
ing personality, a combination 
that she expects to grant her 
a long career in “modeling, 
movies, (and) clothes.” 2016 
was a breakout year for the 
hip-hop diva, as her connec-
tion with Lil Yachty’s Sailing 
Team proved fruitful for both 
parties through the success of 
their collaborative song “Sad.” 
As Shane explains, 2017 is set 
to be even bigger.

Kodie Shane is wearing a 

blacked out sweatsuit while 
we chat, having come straight 
off her tour bus and hardly had 
time to orient herself to the 
night’s venue, but her sneakers 
say Saint Laurent — she still 
walks like a full-fledged pop 
princess.

Here are some excerpts from 

our conversation, which have 
been re-arranged for clarity:

***

First and foremost, how’s 

the tour been?

Super lit actually. Way more 

lit than I thought, so, I’m excit-
ed.

How much longer are you 

going to be going around?

Detroit, Chicago, Oakland 

and LA, then we’re done. So, 
like a week.

What has been the most 

fun thing about going on 
tour so far?

I like seeing different people 

everywhere. I think it’s amaz-
ing how there are so many 
people in the world that look 
different.

Do you think that mov-

ing from Atlanta to Chicago 
(during 
your 
childhood) 

affected your sound at all? 
Obviously 
hip-hop 
has 
a 

locality element to it.

I never know what to say 

when people ask me if a cer-
tain state influenced my music. 
I don’t feel like Atlanta makes 
me make this type of music; I 
don’t feel like Chicago makes 
me make this type. I’m just 
making music. I’m not really 
thinking about it any type of 
way — I’m just putting it out.

If I go record in New York, 

it will probably make me feel 
different when I’m recording. 
It will probably give me a dif-
ferent energy. But just because 
I’m from Chicago doesn’t mean 
I’m going to make Chicago 
music. You know what I’m say-
ing?

Just ‘cause I move to Atlanta 

doesn’t mean I’m gonna start 
making different music. If I go 
to LA and record, it will prob-
ably give me a different energy 
than when I record in New 
York, but it doesn’t mean I’m 
about to go make an LA song.

Where I’m from has nothing 

to do with the music I’m mak-
ing, but I definitely think if I 
go to different cities, I can get 
different vibes and stuff like 
that.

Is there a particular city 

right now that you’ve been 
having a lot of fun creating 
in?

I actually never even have 

time to record in different cit-
ies when I’m there, but I love 
LA.

What are your next plans 

as far as projects go?

I’m working on my album 

right now, so I don’t really 
want to say too much about 
that ‘cause I don’t want to give 
it away, but that’s pretty much 
it. It’s album time right now.

Mentally, has that been 

different at all than your 
previous work?

Album? Yeah. I kind of want 

to make, like, some bigger 
music I think. That’s the word 
I’ve been using, but every time 
I use that word nobody gets it. 
I just want to try to make some 
bigger songs.

I’m recording all the time. 

I’m actually having, like, with-
drawals right now ‘cause I 
haven’t recorded since we’ve 
been on tour. Hopefully I can 
get some studio time in LA.

Do you have any ideas that 

you have always wished you 
could enact that — now the 
you’re being put in a position 
where anything is possible 
— you’re excited to finally 
carry out?

Nah, anything I wanted to 

do, I just did, so if I want to 
make a pop song, I just do it.

I want to do movies, or 

modeling. That’s something 
I always wanted to do. I’m 
not about to be doing just any 
movie (though). Like, it’s got to 
be a fire movie. I got to be like, 
‘Damn, if I’m not in that movie, 
I still want to see it!’ You know 
what I’m saying?

I’m not doing a low budget 

movie. It’s got to hit all the-

aters at once.

A blockbuster?
A blockbuster! I need a 

blockbuster. I’m not going 
straight 
to 
Netflix. 
Even 

though that’s beasty, though. 
I’m just saying.

For real: Modeling; Movies; 

Clothes. The whole thing.

You design?
I mean, I will.
I read online that Coach K 

[who manages Gucci Mane 
and Young Thug] and you 
had a sort of musical rela-
tionship. Did he mentor you?

A lot of people inspire me, 

but I never really had a mentor. 
I just knew (Coach) when I was 
younger. He knew my producer 
— Matty P.

I definitely feel like people 

have helped me out — I’ll never 
take that away from anybody. 
I’ll always give the credit, like, 
(Lil) Yachty helped me, Coach 
helped me. Nobody ever, like, 
taught me how to do anything.

Yachty could be like: “I took 

her on tour! That’s my little 
sister.” But he could never be 
like: “I taught her what she 
knows.” You know what I’m 
saying? N*ggas ain’t teach me 
nothing.

What are your plans for 

the summer?

Turn up even more. South 

By Southwest, all of that.

You’ve been before?
South By? Yeah, but this 

year is about to be my turnt 
up year. Last year was a really 
good year for me. This year I’m 
turnt up. Wait until you see 
what stages I’m doing.

Hell yeah. I’m excited to 

see.

You gon’ be — N*ggas gon’ be 

like — DAAAANG she lit!

Nothing little this year. All 

big shit this year. Big shit this 
year. Big stuff this year. Big 
things this year. Big ‘tings this 
year. Nothing little. No little 
South By Southwest stages. 
No little money. No little noth-
ing. I’m about to go get me two 
iPhone Pluses ‘cause these 
(smaller sized ones are) too 
small.

What are you gonna do 

after the tour, when you 
finally have some time to 
just kick it?

I’ll probably not be doing 

nothing for a week once we 
get off tour, then I’m going 
straight to, I don’t know — I got 
too much shit going on. I got so 
much going on, bruh!

I like Hulu.
What do you watch on 

Hulu?

“Clarence.” I like cartoons. 

The colors keep me going.

Well, I guess you’ll just 

have to turn up extra hard on 
your birthday this year then.

I’ll be nineteen, I probably 

won’t do nothing this year. I’ll 
probably go to dinner this year. 
I’ll probably be able to pay for 
it now. My people. Dat way. 
The family way.

UNIVERSAL PICTURES

Jordan Peele laudably directs sharp, 
thrilling and hysterical ‘Get Out’

A young African-American 

man walks down an idyl-
lic street in the middle of 
the night and 
finds 
himself 

followed 
by 
a 

white car blast-
ing polka music. 
“Get Out” opens 
with this gem 
of a scene, and 
like the opener 
of any great film, it encapsu-
lates everything the audience 
needs to know about what will 
follow. It’s foreboding, creepy, 
funny, 
uncomfortable 
and 

Jordan Peele (“Key & Peele”) 
directs the hell out of it.

“Get Out” is so well-round-

ed that it’s hard to nail down 
exactly what the star aspect of 
the thing is. In his directorial 
debut, Peele shoots the afore-
mentioned scene in a single 
gut-twisting shot whose fluid 
motion and point-of-view styl-
ings bring to mind horror clas-
sics like “Halloween” and more 
contemporary films like “The 
Conjuring.” For a first time 
director, he has an astonish-
ingly assured hand. Even the 
smallest of camera movements 
during an otherwise peaceful 
dialogue scene are immedi-
ately disquieting. The use of 
sound, especially in its some-
times sudden absence, adds 
to the deeply uncomfortable 
atmosphere that he spends the 
entire runtime cultivating.

It’s 
impossible 
to 
dis-

count the strength of the 
leads though. Daniel Kaluuya 
(“Sicario”) is absolutely com-
manding in the lead perfor-
mance as Chris, a Black man 
who 
goes 
with 
his 
white 

girlfriend to visit her family 
upstate. In the beginning, it 

is a mostly under-
stated 
perfor-

mance made up of 
Chris’s ticks as he 
deals with a near-
constant 
barrage 

of 
unintentional 

racism. As the plot 
thickens, Kaluuya 

transforms Chris into more of 
a classic horror protagonist, 
desperate in his quest for sur-
vival and able to communicate 
the depths of his character’s 
inner thoughts with little more 
than a glance.

Props must also go to Brad-

ley Whitford (“The Cabin in 
the Woods”) for turning on 
a dime between affable and 
creepy. Lil Rey Howery (“The 
Carmichael 
Show”) 
nearly 

runs away with the entire 
movie, though, in a comedic 
performance that lands the 
laughs every time. “Get Out” is 
classified as a horror-comedy, 
and Howery allows Peele to 
bring his already clear-cut tal-
ents as a renowned funnyman 
to the screen without detract-
ing from the thrills.

It is worth noting that while 

“Get Out” has been market-
ed as a horror film first and 
foremost, it operates more as 
a psychological thriller than 
anything else. There is little in 
the way of classic “scares” here, 
and while Peele’s commitment 

to creating an unnerving mood 
for his film is admirable, the 
pacing does tend to drag at cer-
tain points.

Still, Peele is a confident 

storyteller, as evidenced by 
the series of reveals that dot 
the film, peeling back the lay-
ers of the plot while simul-
taneously adding new ones 
to the subtext. Some of these 
twists work better than others; 
they all land, but where one 
in particular is foreshadowed 
throughout the movie and 
should prove enjoyable during 
the inevitable repeat viewings, 
others feel much more sudden 
and even borderline silly. It’s 
certainly not enough to ruin or 
even really dampen the experi-
ence, but there were stronger 
directions to take the story 
that would have had the same 
thematic effect.

All of this, even the flaws, 

adds up to a deeply uncomfort-
able, unsettling movie expe-
rience, and that’s the point. 
Peele clearly wanted to cre-
ate a film that confronted and 
deconstructed the racism per-
vasive in modern society, and 
on that level, “Get Out” is a 
resounding success. It’s in the 
dialogue, the little racist pokes 
that add up to something more 
sinister over time. It’s in the 
performances, the effect that 
even the most unintentional 
jabs have on the characters and 
the audience. And nowhere is it 
more evident than in the direc-
tion, the lens through which 
we are forced to watch and 
reckon with the myriad mod-
ern prejudices that many still 
face today.

FILM REVIEW

‘Drunk’ is a charming, wacky release

MUSIC REVIEW

Thundercat has never been one 

for the spotlight. Born Stephen 
Bruner, the (nearly) all-purpose 
musician has made a career out 
of 
complementation, 
whether 

it be with similarly-acclaimed 
producer 
Flying 

Lotus 
or 
even 

Kendrick Lamar. 
His own first two 
studio 
albums, 

The Golden Age of 
Apocalypse (2011) and Apocalypse 
(2013), were both promising, and 
Drunk, released Feb. 24, continues 
the solid streak.

Its 23-track length, which at 

first can be mistaken as intimi-
dating, is soon realized to be an 
extended trip; a palpable weird-
ness ushers the listener along with 
an unrushed walk-in-the-park 
type feel, if that walk in the park 
was an intergalactic ride through 
the funk-infused Thunder Galaxy.

Still, Drunk feeds on features 

— “Show You the Way” arguably 
wins the entire album, bolstered 
by surprise appearances from 
Michael McDonald and Kenny 
Loggins, while the potent “Walk 
On By” immediately follows with 
a Kendrick Lamar verse. The pair-
ing that gave To Pimp a Butterfly 
its iconic sound is just as power-

ful in this reunion. Thundercat 
cheeks a resonating sentiment 
(“At the end of it all / Nobody 
wants to drink alone”) and, of 
course, Lamar does his shit.

At times the project seems like 

it’s operating drunkenly, or maybe 
tripped out, or maybe both. “Cap-
tain Stupido” lives on ever-chang-
ing tempo and irrational dialogue 
— “I feel weird / Comb your beard, 

brush 
your 
teeth 

/ Still feel weird / 
Beat your meat, go 
to sleep” — but it 
works. 
Thunder-

cat has showed us 

before how to embrace and utilize 
the weird (see: “Wesley’s Theory,” 
the first track on Lamar’s Butter-
fly) and in “Jameel’s Space Ride,” 
an otherwise provocative track, 
he intertwines spontaneity with 
actual implication, squeezing in 
an assertive “Fuck yeah” without 
regard for stricture.

The looseness of the album 

should not be confused for a lack 
of cohesion; Drunk thrives on the 
melodic agreement from track to 
track. It’s refreshing, really, to be 
part of this prolonged adventure 
without ever feeling overworked, 
or stale, or even bored. Each 
track brings with it an unfamil-
iar sound, albeit one that lends 
itself accordingly to the feel of the 
album.

If not taking itself seriously is 

the ethos behind this release, a 

Wiz Khalifa verse seems very fit-
ting. Wiz does his shit too, which 
is OK, because this is a track, and 
an album, about cheekily doing 
things — love things, groove 
things, rebellious things, things of 
the like — with an air of buoyancy. 
Hence, Wiz, and hence, “Drink 
Dat.”

It has become a signature for 

Thundercat, this buddy-buddy 

style of both swerve and some-
times 
subtle 
commiseration. 

Drunk, grounded in its under-
tones of R&B, soul, and funk, cre-
ates an aura of obscurity. It proves 
that, sometimes, the lines need to 
be blurred.

‘Timeless’ finale leaves open many 
enticing possibilities for next season

NBC

After a successful season 

punctuated by moderate reviews 
and a decent following, NBC’s 
time-travelling drama “Time-
less” may have 
reached the end 
of 
a 
chapter, 

though 
it 
has 

yet to close the 
book. The sole 
fact that “Time-
less” draws upon 
historical events 
only proves the 
extent to which they can take 
the drama. Paired with the fact 
that co-producer Eric Kripke is 
not one for short seasons, fans 
can expect “Timeless” to be 
in for the long-haul. So, with 
a finale that thrived on twists 
and cliff-hangers, what makes 
“Timeless” different than other 
series of this nature?

The finale began in the pres-

ent, as the Lifeboat returns to 
treat Rufus (Malcolm Barrett, 
“War on Everyone”) from a gun-
shot wound before promptly 
returning to the past — Wash-
ington, D.C. in 1954, to be pre-
cise. 
However, 
when 
Lucy 

(Claudia Doumit, “All My Chil-
dren”) and Wyatt (Matt Lanter, 
“Star Wars Rebels”) are framed 
as Soviet spies by Flynn (Goran 
Višnjić, “ER”), who blackmailed 
Senator McCarthy into disclos-

ing the location of the Ritten-
house summit, they must rely 
on familial ties to take down 
Rittenhouse. More specifically, 
Lucy’s grandfather, whom they 
track back to a ‘50s era gay bar. 
The conversation that ensues 
displays the best of “Timeless,” 
which is a message of hope and 

love. The moments 
that 
are 
shared 

between Lucy and 
her grandfather are 
emotional moments 
that really click.

In 
the 
same 

manner, 
many 

moments are hit-
and-miss, such as 

those between Rufus and his 
injured girlfriend Jiya (Clau-
dia Doumit, “Losing in Love”). 
Though the Lifeboat is typical-
ly meant for three passengers, 
Rufus’s injury persuades Jiya to 
join the gang on their blast to the 
past. Soon after, she begins to 
experience the uncharted side 
effects of wormhole travel via 
violent seizures and bloodshot 
eyes. There are moments in this 
performance where the couple is 
perhaps over-playing their roles, 
and yet a silent speech between 
the two shows a tender moment 
and is just another aspect that 
“Timeless” proves it is spec-
tacular at pulling off. Perhaps if 
“Timeless” realizes its strengths 
whilst addressing its weakness-
es with the cliched romance, 
these romances can withstand 
the test of time. Later on in the 

episode, another seizure from 
Jiya, which seemingly pulls her 
between the ‘50s and present 
day, proves that “Timeless” has 
only touched the surface of long-
standing effects of time travel.

Despite the overall success of 

the finale, the episode was still 
decently rushed for the amount 
of material on the agenda. For 
example, Lucy and Wyatt’s final 
confrontation with Flynn feels 
a little rushed and the last few 
moments of the series deserved 
more time than the air time 
allowed. As Lucy returns home 
to her mother to express her 
desire to save her younger sis-
ter in the past, she uncovers 
an ugly truth — to Lucy’s hor-
ror, her mother is a member of 
the Rittenhouse, a fact which 
makes Lucy practically “Rit-
tenhouse royalty.” In a moment 
where there are few words, the 
actresses work the facial expres-
sions and wordless dialogue 
with a believable ease. Though 
there are many questions still 
up in the air as to the fate of the 
time-travelling team, the show’s 
creators are confident (perhaps 
even prematurely so) that view-
ers will be able to follow the 
Lifeboat onwards to season two 
of the series. Until then, “Time-
less” should consider keeping 
its weaknesses from affecting 
its strengths and drawing from 
the moments that truly make 
“Timeless” a memorable and 
historically interesting drama 
series.

Vanessa Carlton keeps things both 
honest and relevant at The Ark show

HBO

Last February 23rd at the 

Ark, it was clear what song 
Vanessa Carlton was going 
to open with even before she 
started playing it. She said 
that she was going to perform 
this one first — “just to let this 
ship sail” — and immediately 
people in the audience started 
clapping and cheering, know-
ing that Carlton’s 2002 hit, “A 
Thousand Miles,” was about to 
follow.

Some artists will save their 

most popular songs for later in 
the show, just to keep the audi-
ence guessing, but I admired 
Carlton’s 
approach, 
getting 

it out of the way. It actually 
cleared the air and allowed 
her to go full speed ahead 
with performances of some of 
her more recent work, a lot of 
which I personally found more 
musically interesting than “A 
Thousand Miles.”

Carlton has an organic voice 

that comes across as sharp and 
sweet at the same time. It’s 
melodic and smooth, but it also 
can have a bit of an edge, and 
her range is nothing to ques-
tion, either. Listening to her 
unique voice, it sounded like 
it was coming less from any 
strong outer influences, and 
more from years of her own 
personal experience crafting 
it. Add to that her distinctive 
songwriting and piano-play-
ing skills, and it isn’t hard to 
tell why so many of the people 
at the Ark that night were so 
excited to see her. A couple 
of them called out requests at 
different times, and just from 
listening to some of the things 
the people around me were 
saying, I could tell that many 
of them were serious about 
Carlton. Some had driven to 
Ann Arbor from out of town to 
see her perform, and many had 
already seen her shows in the 
past.

After “A Thousand Miles,” 

Carlton did a few more songs 
that the crowd recognized and 
applauded — “Carousel,” “Fair-
weather Friend” — before mov-
ing into work from her newest 
album, Liberman. According to 
Carlton, the album was named 
after her family’s original sur-
name, which was changed by 
her grandfather earlier in the 
twentieth century. While she 
was performing these songs, 
she had a painting of her 
grandfather’s projected onto 
the wall behind her, featuring 
three women dancing in what 
looks like a sort of ritual. The 
women were all based on the 
same model, which inspired 
Carlton, as she said it looked 
like the woman was “in a ritual 
with herself.”

It was interesting to hear 

the stories that Carlton would 
tell to introduce each song. In 
addition to her family’s histo-
ry with the name “Liberman,” 
she had songs that referenced 
or addressed people in her life, 
such as an ex (“Fairweather 
Friend”), her daughter Sidney 
(“River”), and her husband (“I 
Don’t Want to Be a Bride”). 
One song, “Annie,” was dedi-
cated to a young girl Carlton 
met through the Make-a-Wish 
Foundation many years ago, 
who since then has continued 
to battle cancer and recently 
celebrated her quinceanera.

Carlton also used some of 

her songs to focus on current 
social and political issues. 
She 
dedicated 
her 
perfor-

mance of “Who’s To Say” to 
“all of us, because we’re all 
human beings,” but prefaced 
it with an address to anyone 
in the LGBTQ community, 
which 
seemed 
to 
resonate 

with a lot of the people in the 
crowd. Later on in the night, 
she performed another song, 
“Marching Line,” in memory 
of last year’s Paris attack. It 
was clear, both from the song 
itself and from the way that 
Carlton was talking about it, 
that this was an event that had 
greatly affected her emotion-
ally, and she referred to art 

as a “church” and a “sacred 
space” that people could use to 
try to somehow come to terms 
with even the most devastating 
events.

Carlton’s 
accompanying 

instrumentalist 
took 
some 

of these social concerns into 
a place of action at the end 
of the show. He announced 
to the audience before the 
last song that while Carlton 
was signing merchandise, he 
would be sitting at a table with 
stamped, 
ready-to-go 
post-

cards that audience members 
could address to their rep-
resentatives. He had printed 
out the addresses of Governor 
Rick Snyder (R-MI), US Sena-
tor Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) 
and US Senator Gary Peters 
(D-MI), 
along 
with 
many 

of their stances on political 
issues, such as the environ-
ment and same-sex marriage. 
Many audience members took 
him up on this after the show, 
including myself. Throughout 
the show, he had been a terrific 
talent, switching easily and 
often 
between 
instruments 

like the violin and the guitar, 
and it was refreshing to see 
him and Carlton using their 
artistic platform to propel peo-
ple toward concrete changes. 
It’s one thing to suggest that 
people write to their represen-
tatives, but it’s another thing 
to print out those represen-
tatives’ information and put 
stamped postcards and pens in 
people’s hands.

Rather than leaving the 

stage at the end and then com-
ing back out for an encore, 
Carlton simply stayed out, tell-
ing the audience beforehand 
that this would be their last 
song. I had never really seen 
that done at a concert before, 
and it struck me as fitting that 
Carlton was finishing her show 
on the same note that she had 
started it: She was refreshingly 
honest, and to the benefit of 
both herself and her audience, 
she was doing this her own 
way.

Michigan’s bullpen taking shape behind Lamb, Lehmann

Jackson Lamb has experienced 

plenty during his three-plus 
years at Michigan. As a freshman 
in 2014, he appeared primarily as 
an outfielder, making 29 starts. 
Moving to pitcher full-time the 
next season, he pitched just 17.2 
innings combined as injuries 
sidelined him for long stretches 
of time. 

Lamb’s 
talent 
has 
never 

been 
in 
question. 
Standing 

an 
imposing 
6-foot-6 
and 

possessing a powerful fastball, 
he recorded a 1.50 earned-run 
average and 10.1 strikeouts 
per game over his first three 
seasons, 
albeit 
in 
limited 

playing time, and was drafted 
in the 35th round of the MLB 
Draft by the St. Louis Cardinals 
last summer. But until this year, 
he had yet to carve out a steady 
role in the Wolverines’ bullpen.

So on Saturday, when Lamb 

took the mound inheriting two 
baserunners with two outs 
in the eighth inning facing 
Southern 
California 
third 

baseman Adalberto Carrillo, 
who had already homered in 
the game, it was a new role for 
the senior right-hander. But 
according to Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich, it’s not a role he’s 
unprepared for.

“He pitches with a lot of 

passion and conviction,” Bakich 
said. “His mindset is a good fit 
for the closer role, and he likes 
being in those situations.”

Lamb would go on to strike 

out Carrillo and retire the side 
in the ninth inning to close 
out the Trojans and record 
his second save of the season, 
further asserting himself in the 
late-inning role he has seemed 
destined to fill. In 6.2 innings 
this season, he has struck out 
three and has yet to allow a run, 
and has prompted Bakich to 
call him a closer “on a mission”. 

In a way, Lamb’s career as a 

whole has been a microcosm of 
Michigan’s bullpen this season. 

The Wolverines possess a deep 
stable of skilled relievers, and 
while they have had several 
huge moments, they have still 
suffered from inconsistency. 
This was exemplified in late 
blown leads against Seton Hall 
during the opening weekend 
and in a near-collapse against 
Creighton 
during 
the 
Jack 

Gifford Tournament last week. 
Bakich believes that this is not 
due to any issues with talent, 
but is more a product of the 
necessary process of nailing 
down clearer roles for the 
relievers early in the season.

“We’ve gotten a lot of good 

looks 
in 
certain 
situations 

from various people and feel 
comfortable with some of our 
relievers in multiple roles,” 

Bakich said. “It’s just going to 
be trimming those roles down 
so they can get comfortable in 
those roles and have the most 
success 
in 

them.”

The 
USC 

game 
also 

saw a crucial 
performance 
from 
senior 

right-hander 
Keith Lehmann, 
a senior whose 
career 
has 

mirrored 
Lamb’s 
in 

many ways. By the end of his 
freshman season, Lehmann had 
become one of Michigan’s most 
consistent pitchers, recording 
a 2.91 ERA in 49.1 innings, 

and 
began 
his 
sophomore 

season as the Wolverines’ No. 
2 starter. But tightness in his 
forearm gradually decreased his 

effectiveness, and 
in turn his playing 
time, to the point 
where it became 
necessary to shut 
him down.

“It’s been an 

interesting 
year 

and a half for him, 
and I know it’s 
been frustrating 
for him,” Bakich 
said. “He tried to 

come back last year and pitch in 
some certain spots, but he just 
wasn’t ready, so we gave him 
some time off. If he’s healthy 
he’s going to be a weapon for 

us in the bullpen and a huge 
asset.”

After the time off, Lehmann 

has turned back the clock to 
begin this season, replicating 
his successes as a freshman. 
His talent and experience came 
through for the Wolverines 
against 
the 
Trojans. 
After 

allowing a bases-loading walk 
in the seventh inning and 
quickly surrendering a 3-0 
count 
to 
pinch-hitter 
John 

Thomas, 
Lehmann 
buckled 

down and struck out Thomas to 
preserve the Wolverines’ three-
run lead.

“To 
have 
(Lamb 
and 

Lehmann) in the game in the 
eighth and ninth was a big 
deal,” Bakich said. “Number one 
because they’re healthy, and 

number two because they’re 
seniors. They have good stuff 
and they showed their veteran 
experience in the bullpen and 
were able to hold the lead in 
a close game. They’re doing a 
really good job of performing in 
pressure situations.”

Another 
key 
performance 

out of Michigan’s bullpen this 
weekend came from another 
pitcher who is still searching 
for a defined role. Junior Alec 
Rennard began the season as 
the Wolverines’ No. 2 starter, 
but was replaced in that role 
over spring break by junior 
Ryan Nutof. But Rennard still 
was able to display what Bakich 
called his “winner’s mentality” 
against San Diego, as he entered 
in relief of starter Michael 
Hendrickson and retired nine 
straight batters, struck out 
three and earned the save on 
Sunday.

And it hasn’t just been the 

upperclassmen 
who 
have 

made an impact. Freshman 
left-hander 
Tommy 
Henry 

has clearly earned the trust 
of the coaching staff, making 
several appearances in high-
leverage situations this season 
and logging a 1.08 ERA and 
12 strikeouts. While it was his 
throwing error that allowed 
UCLA to score the winning run 
Friday, Henry showed poise 
in keeping the game scoreless 
throughout the seventh and 
eighth innings.

Through 
12 
games 
of 

Michigan’s season, it is clear 
that the team possesses a wealth 
of experience, an aggressive 
offense and strong starting 
pitching. The bullpen, however, 
has 
been 
up-and-down, 

mirroring the careers of Lamb 
and Lehmann themselves. But 
just as Lamb and Lehmann 
have found roles for their talent 
to shine through in relief, the 
bullpen as a whole continues 
to take shape, which may give 
the Wolverines the necessary 
ingredient for their aspirations 
to come into play.

Senior right-hander Keith Lehmann has had a tumultuous career due to injuries, but has recently emerged as an anchor of the Wolverines’ emergent bullpen.

Big Ten hockey roundup: One more week

Less than a year ago, members 

of the Michigan hockey team 
gathered around a Big Ten 
Tournament trophy at Xcel 
Energy Center in St. Paul, Minn. 
Laden in championship hats and 
bold smiles, the team celebrated 
one of the most iconic moments 
of its season as it celebrated its 
place at the top of a six-team 
conference.

In nine days, those same six 

hockey teams will gather at Joe 
Louis Arena in Detroit to battle 
it out for a Big Ten Tournament 
title.

For the past three years, a 

different team has left the ice 
with the championship trophy. 
In 
2014 
it 
was 
Wisconsin 

leaving 
Xcel 
as 
champions 

with a 5-4 overtime win over 
Ohio State. In 2015, Minnesota 
knocked out Michigan with 
a 4-2 decision at Joe Louis to 
claim 
the 
tournament 
title, 

complementing 
its 
second 

Big 
Ten 
regular-season 

championship.

Last year, the tables turned 

in favor of the Wolverines. 
Michigan avenged its loss to the 
Golden Gophers the year before 
with a 5-3 win, celebrating its 
first-ever Big Ten Championship 
in hockey.

But the rosters have changed, 

and those standings that once 
placed the Wolverines near the 
top are long gone. Currently, 
after splitting a series with No. 
5 Minnesota, Michigan sits 
second-to-last in the Big Ten, 
only falling in front of Michigan 
State.

The Spartans sit on the 

bottom rung of the Big Ten 
ladder with just 11 points. 
They are stuck with a 3-13-
2 conference record and an 
overall record of 7-22-3.

The Wolverines haven’t fared 

much better, though, with a .278 
win percentage and 16 points. 
They do have one additional 
conference win (and one fewer 

loss) with a conference and 
overall record of 4-12-2 and 
11-18-3, respectively.

Boasting the best record 

in the Big Ten are, again, the 
Golden Gophers. Under the 
instruction 
of 

Don Lucia — 
the 
program’s 

head 
coach 

for 
the 
past 

18 
years 
— 

Minnesota has 
recorded 
13 

wins 
against 

Big Ten teams 
this 
season. 

Saddled 
with 

a 
.722 
win 

percentage 
and 39 points, the Golden 
Gophers have only lost to three 
conference teams, including a 
single loss to Michigan and two 
to both Wisconsin and Ohio 

State.

The Golden Gophers have 

recorded an impressive 22-10-
2 overall record and a .676 win 
percentage, and currently have 
131 goals scored with 96 goals 

against.

Just 
trailing 

Minnesota 
is 

Wisconsin, which 
has 
an 
almost 

identical Big Ten 
win-loss 
record 

as 
the 
Golden 

Gophers, save a 
single win and 
additional 
loss. 

The 
Badgers 

feature a .667-win 
percentage 
and 

36 points, and a 19-12-1 overall 
record. 

The third and fourth spots 

of the Big Ten standings are 
occupied by Penn State and Ohio 

State, respectively. The Nittany 
Lions are only in their fifth 
season as an NCAA Division I 
ice hockey team, yet they have 
managed to land at No. 11 in the 
USCHO poll. Penn State has the 
second-highest overall record 
among Big Ten teams at 21-9-2, 
but comes in at third in the Big 
Ten with 31 points.

Ohio State ranks fourth with 

29 points and a 9-8-1 Big Ten 
record. After dropping a single 
game to Michigan two weeks 
ago, the Buckeyes fell from No. 
11 to No. 15 in the poll, but still 
sit in the middle of the Big Ten 
standings.

But 
another 
week 
of 

conference play still remains, 
and each team has one last 
chance to give itself a push before 
hitting the Big Ten Tournament. 
After that, it’s anyone’s game in 
Joe Louis Arena.

With a final weekend of Big Ten play remaining, the Wolverines sit in second-

After that, it’s 
anyone’s game 

at Joe Louis 

Arena

T

wo weeks ago at the ACC/
Big Ten Challenge, the 
Michigan softball team’s 

10 home runs made it seem as if 
the opening weekend’s poor run 
production against No. 2 Florida 
and No. 25 UCF was just a fluke, 
an inevitable early-season hiccup 
in a cold-weather school’s path 
to another strong season. But 
the team has averaged just 1.8 
runs per game in eight contests 
— three of which were shutouts 
— against ranked opponents this 
season. 

It would be easy to blame 

the offensive ineptitude on the 
graduation of two of the most 
proficient hitters in program 
history. Sierra Romero, the 2016 
USA Softball Collegiate Player of 
the Year, and Sierra Lawrence, 
who batted .429 with 11 home 
runs and 45 RBI last season, 
are both gone from the core of a 
lineup that averaged over seven 
runs per game.

“(Romero) is a huge loss, 

but I got over it in September,” 
Hutchins said. “She’s gone; she 
was great. That’s team 39 — my 
only focus is on Team 40. I’m not 
going to talk about Sierra Romero 
and say what a great career she 
had. My team is not focused on 
her, she’s irrelevant.”

While Romero might be gone 

in Hutchins’ mind, her returning 
players have yet to pick up the 
slack; the underproduction of 
returning players is also a culprit 
of the offensive struggles endured 
by the Wolverines thus far.

Getting shutout by No. 22 

Baylor in the Judi Garman Classic 
last weekend demonstrated how 
far the team is from that slugging 
bombardment, as Michigan 
struck out six times and collected 
just two hits against the Bears. 
A combined two runs against 
No. 7 UCLA and No. 20 Arizona 
State the next day offered another 
microcosm of the offensive 
struggles Michigan has endured.

Junior first baseman and 

pitcher Tera Blanco’s average has 
dropped 180 points, while senior 

infielder Lindsay Montemarano 
is hitting under .250 — a steep 
drop from the adequate .323 of 
last season. In 2016, not a single 
Wolverine starter batted under 
the .310 mark. This year, three 
Wolverines have averages under 
.275. There is still plenty of 
time to turn the season around, 
but if the current trend is any 
indication, the production will 
not match that of last season.

Senior outfielder Kelly 

Christner, hitting .500 with four 
home runs and 20 RBI, bucks the 
trend. She launched three home 
runs in a single visit to North 
Carolina State in that ACC/Big 
Ten Challenge.

But despite that monstrous 

weekend in Raleigh, the team’s 
power is also lacking; Michigan 
averages just .84 home runs per 
game in comparison to the 2016 
mean of nearly 1.5 blasts per 
contest. 

As the Wolverines needed 

to find a second option behind 
senior right-hander Megan 
Betsa, Blanco has emerged in 
the circle with nine starts and a 
2.61 earned-run average. While 
conventional thought points to a 
drop-off in offensive production 
that comes with added pitching 
responsibility, Hutchins didn’t 
believe Blanco’s bat would be 
affected.

“I don’t think (pitching and the 

loss of offensive production) has 
to go hand-in-hand,” Hutchins 
said. “She spent most of the 
preseason pitching, but she was 
first-team All-American because 
of her bat.”

But Blanco’s .224 batting 

average says otherwise. Instead 
of being the consistent presence 
she was last season, Blanco has 
struggled to be the run-producing 
force expected from her role in 
the middle of the Michigan order.

To have the success the 

Wolverines hoped to have, Blanco 
and returning players must 
prove that Romero’s absence is 
irrelevant to them, too.

That’s the only way Michigan 

will prove that the outburst of the 
ACC/Big Ten Challenge wasn’t 
just a fluke.

Walton dominates in Lincoln, earns Big Ten honors

LINCOLN — Amid a nearly 

perfect game, there was a moment 
Sunday night when Michigan’s 
half-court set was launched into 
disarray. 

It was certainly a rare case 

in Lincoln, as the Wolverines 
dismantled 
the 
Cornhuskers 

in front of a crowd of 14,071. 
Michigan’s 
36-point 
victory 

marked Nebraska’s worst losing 
margin at home in the 121-year 
existence of the program.

But it happened nonetheless, 

largely because Derrick Walton Jr. 
was playing too well.

The play blew up because 

Michigan coach John Beilein had 
called one play. Walton had called 
another. Half the team followed 
its coach’s orders, the other half 
followed its senior guard’s lead. But 
given all the issues that plagued 
Michigan early in its season, there 
were worse things that could have 
happened for the Wolverines as 
they rounded out their regular 
season.

“That’s a good problem to have 

right now,” Beilein said. “That 
was Trey Burke-like out there, the 
way (Walton) just controlled the 
tempo.”

The Trey Burke comparison — it 

has followed Walton for four years 
now. He has never embraced it. 
Neither have his teammates. And 
Beilein hasn’t either.

Except there was one big 

difference Sunday night. This time, 
when Beilein drew the comparison 
himself, it was about what Walton 
is, not what the Michigan fan 
base has, arguably unrealistically, 
wanted him to be.

As the Wolverines prepared 

to board the bus to the airport, 
Pinnacle Bank Arena had long 
been emptied. The only people that 
remained in the stands were the 
custodians, cleaning up the final 
traces of what had been a long game 
for the Nebraska basketball team.

And then there was a small 

conglomerate of maize and blue 

standing at the end of one of the 
arena’s 
tunnels. 
That’s 
where 

Walton stood, talking to the 
members of families that had made 
the trip to Lincoln, basking in the 
aura of what had been one hell 
of a night. He was all smiles, and 
rightfully so.

Michigan capped off its Big 

Ten season with a win that looked 
like the Wolverines were playing 
against their scout team. And boy 
did it get ugly.

Walton was the concertmaster 

of it all, finishing with 18 points on 
5-for-10 shooting and 16 assists to 
break the single-game assist record 
held by Gary Grant since 1987. The 
performance earned him a nod as 
the Co-Big Ten Player of the Week.

“It means a lot to me,” Walton 

said of etching his name into the 
program record book. “I’m a guy 
who loves to make other people 
better. So to see my guys happy 

making shots and me being the guy 
as one of the reasons why is a great 
feeling.”

It’s been a season in which 

saying Walton is helping his team 
would 
be 
an 
understatement. 

Over the Wolverines’ seven-game 
stretch in the month of February, 
Walton averaged 17.3 points, 6.4 
rebounds and 5.4 assists while 
notching two double-doubles and 
leading Michigan to a 5-2 record 
that could have just as easily been a 
perfect 7-0.

As Beilein described, if it were 

football, his senior guard would be 
calling half of the plays out of the 
huddle.

Quite simply, Walton has been 

playing like a man who knows 
that his days are numbered, and 
that the number of those days 
are largely dependent on his own 
performance. Sunday night was the 
pinnacle of that.

Roughly two weeks ago, Beilein 

stood at the podium in a state of 
retrospection. He admitted that he 
didn’t think there was someone on 
Michigan’s roster that he could give 
the ball to and tell them to go get 
themselves a bucket.

He used to have two players 

like that. He recalled the 2012-13 
season, when he had the freedom 
to let Burke and Mitch McGary 
dictate games in their closing 
minutes. For the majority of this 
season, Beilein didn’t have that 
option. On Sunday night, that may 
have changed.

In the bowels of Pinnacle Bank 

Arena, as he was reminded of his 
comments about the Wolverines’ 
lack of a go-to scorer in light of 
what Walton had just done to the 
Cornhuskers, a grin cracked over 
his face and he had five words that 
said it all.

“It looked like it tonight.”

Derrick Walton Jr. will leave 

Michigan with the honor of being 
named one of the Big Ten’s best 
players.

The 
senior 
guard 
was 

announced as a member of the 
2016-17 second team All-Big 
Ten, averaging 14.5 points, 4.7 
rebounds and 4.5 assists per 
game through the regular season.

While he consistently led the 

Wolverines in scoring and assists 
all season long, Walton’s form 
picked up in conference play, 
where his leadership both on and 
off the court helped Michigan 
close out the Big Ten regular 
season on a high note.

Walton finished in the top-10 

of individual conference scoring, 
assists, free-throw percentage, 
3-point percentage and defensive 

rebounding. The senior’s impact 
helped Michigan finish with 
a 10-8 Big Ten record and win 
six of its final eight conference 
games. 
Walton 
finished 
the 

conference season earning four 
double-doubles, scoring 20-plus 
points in six outings and picking 
up two Big Ten player of the 
Week honors along the way.

The senior guard also became 

the first Wolverine player and 
just the 13th in Big Ten history 
to record over 1,000 points, 500 
rebounds and 400 assists in his 
career.

Purdue 
forward 
Caleb 

Swanigan, Wisconsin forward 
Ethan Happ, Iowa guard Peter 
Jok, 
Maryland 
guard 
Melo 

Trimble and Minnesota guard 
Nate Mason were all selected to 
the first team All-Big Ten over 
Walton.

Walton is joined by Michigan 

State forward Miles Bridges, 
Illinois forward Malcolm Hill, 
Northwestern 
guard 
Bryant 

McIntosh, 
Wisconsin 
guard 

Bronson 
Koenig 
(coaches 

selection) and Nebraska guard 
Tai Webster (media selection) on 
the conference’s all-second team.

Senior guard Zak Irvin and 

sophomore 
forward 
Moritz 

Wagner also earned All-Big Ten 
honorable mentions.

Irvin and Wagner finished 

as the Wolverines’ second and 
third highest scorers, averaging 
12.6 and 12.4 points per game, 
respectively. Wagner finished 
with 
the 
conference’s 
sixth 

highest field goal percentage, 
while Irvin led the Big Ten in 
minutes played.

In 
addition 
to 
his 
all-

conference honors, Walton was 
named co-Big Ten Player of the 
Week following the Wolverines’ 
loss at Northwestern and win 
against Nebraska. The senior 
averaged 16.5 points and 11 assists 
across both games and now is 
the sole owner of Michigan’s 
single-game assist record after 
earning 16 helpers against the 
Cornhuskers on Sunday.

Peppers confident in ability at Combine

It has been a busy few days 

in 
Indianapolis 
for 
former 

Michigan football players.

While 
their 
season 
may 

have ended a couple months 
ago in a 33-32 loss to Florida 
State in the Orange Bowl, 
these 
ex-Wolverines 
have 

been participating at the NFL 
Combine — an event which, 
in this day and age, carries 
close to as much importance 
as on-field production does. 
Michigan sent 14 players — the 
most of any college team — to 
the invitation-only combine.

For a week, players from 

across the country underwent 
testing 
(both 
physical 
and 

mental) 
under 
the 
close 

examination 
of 
NFL 
front 

office 
executives, 
coaches 

and scouts. The combine is an 
arduous, 
uniquely-designed 

job interview where a good 
showing can result in a prospect 
skyrocketing up draft boards. 
On the other hand, any sort 
of slip-up is scrutinized and 
can negatively affect a player’s 
position in April’s NFL Draft.

For the 12 Wolverines who 

participated in the physical 
drills (former tight end Jake 
Butt and cornerback Jeremy 
Clark sat out while undergoing 
rehabilitation 
for 
injuries 

suffered during the season), the 
results were mixed. Some, like 
former defensive lineman Taco 
Charlton, posted eye-popping 
numbers, while others tested on 
the lower end of their position 
groups.

Yet there may not have been 

another Michigan player who 
was watched more than Jabrill 
Peppers, 
a 
fitting 
outcome 

considering all the hoopla the 
former athlete generated in his 
three years in Ann Arbor.

Peppers 
— 
a 
do-it-all 

Heisman finalist who played 
in all three phases of the game 
— had a particularly intensive 
combine, testing with both the 
linebackers and defensive backs 
on consecutive days.

His is a special case; while 

Peppers spent most of his time as 

a linebacker for the Wolverines 
last season, carving out a role 
as a knifing, penetrating run 
defender and edge-setter, NFL 
prognosticators have debated 
which position he will play once 
he reaches the league.

One of the bigger questions 

entering 
the 
combine 
was 

whether Peppers will stick 
inside the box or become a 
safety. The other side of the ball 
is not out of the question, either. 
NFL.com’s Chase Goodbread 
tweeted two days ago that a 
couple 
teams 
“have 
asked” 

Peppers about playing running 
back or slot receiver.

But while Peppers did play 

some offense last year, mostly 
in a wildcat formation, the 
most likely scenario is that 
he sticks on defense — after 
all, he played the bulk of his 
snaps as a Wolverine there. 
Peppers began his career as a 
defensive back, moving into a 
role as a nickel defender under 
former defensive coordinator 
DJ Durkin. In his first year as a 
starter, he displayed a penchant 
for disrupting wide receiver 
screens 
and 
providing 
run 

support from the secondary, 
while also playing a decent 

amount of pass coverage (of 
which results were mixed).

Then, when Durkin left and 

was replaced by Don Brown, 
Peppers moved even closer 
to the line. Designated as the 
SAM linebacker, he took on 
even more of an attacking role 
— blitzing often — and played 
even fewer snaps in coverage.

It is a testament to Peppers’ 

athleticism that, amidst this 
positional uncertainty, he has 
remained in the first round 
in most draft projections — 
although that uncertainty may 
have been cleared up at the 
combine.

Peppers himself was quoted 

at the combine Saturday as 
saying he is a safety, and 
his 
physical 
measurements 

would imply the same. At 
just under 5-foot-11 and 213 
pounds with an arm length 
of 30 and ¾ inches, Peppers 
ranks in the third, zeroth and 
eighth 
percentiles 
amongst 

linebackers, 
respectively, 

according 
to 
mockdraftable.

com.

His 40-yard dash, 10-yard 

split and broad jump were 
all tops amongst linebackers 
at the combine, but his size 

may preclude a shift to the 
secondary, where his speed and 
agility still rank close to the top.

And though the question 

of 
which 
position 
Peppers 

will play at the next level 
may have a definite answer, a 
move back to safety may give 
way to additional queries. His 
coverage skills will certainly be 
among them; according to Pro 
Football Focus, Peppers gave 
up 58 receptions to opposing 
receivers in 93 targets over 
his three seasons at Michigan. 
Scouts may point to his lack of 
experience shadowing receivers 
and tight ends and advise their 
teams to opt for safer choices 
in players who have roamed 
the defensive backfield for the 
entirety of their careers.

None of this, though, appears to 

have outwardly affected Peppers.

“The bottom line is, I’m a ball 

player, and I’m a hell of a ball 
player,” Peppers said to assorted 
members of the media on 
Saturday. “I intend to run fast, 
I intend to look smooth, doing 
whatever it is that I’m asked to 
do. After a couple of interviews, 
I think these coaches pretty 
much know what they’re going 
to get.”

Wolverines await 
Tournament fate

Typically, a team in the 

position that the Michigan 
women’s basketball team is 
in would be grateful. The 
Wolverines are a presumed 
lock 
for 
their 
first 
NCAA 

Tournament 
berth 
in 
four 

seasons, after being selected 
for 
the 
Women’s 
National 

Invitational 
Tournament 

the past three years. With a 
program record-tying 22 wins 
thus far, Michigan’s season is 
obviously nothing to belittle.

But for the 

Wolverines, 
a 
state 
of 

uncertainty 
exists as they are 
left 
searching 

for 
more. 
On 

Feb. 
15, 
with 

four 
games 

remaining 
on 

their 
schedule 

plus the Big Ten 
Tournament to 
play in, they needed just two more 
wins to claim sole possession of 
the all-time program record for 
victories in a season. Yet, their 
1-4 jog to the finish line has put 
that goal on hold.

Once 
projected 
as 
high 

as a No. 6 seed in the NCAA 
Tournament, a solid end to 
the 
regular 
season 
could 

have given Michigan a top-16 
seed nationally, and with it, a 
chance for home games come 
tournament time. But it couldn’t 
hold on, and are now focused on 
resiliency rather than riding 
momentum.

“So down the stretch here 

we’ve had the tough part of our 
schedule, and obviously we have 
to regroup from that moving 
forward,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “I think a 
couple of days, obviously, off 
will get the kids a break and get 
them fresh again.”

With 
no 
regular 
season 

games remaining and one week 
before the selection show, the 

Wolverines can do nothing 
but 
practice 
and 
twiddle 

their thumbs until their fate 
is 
revealed. 
ESPN 
predicts 

Michigan as one of the last four 
teams in the tournament as a 
10-seed in the Stockton, Calif. 
regional.

The Wolverines have shown 

their volatility on the court, and 
it is difficult to count them out of 
any first round game. But their 
sluggish Big Ten finish has left 
much to be desired and brought 
back 
previously-unanswered 

questions about their game 
plan. 
Its 
second 
loss 
to 

Michigan 
State 

this year — in 
neutral territory 
at the Big Ten 
Tournament 
— surely left a 
sour 
taste 
for 

Michigan. 
But 

it also inspired 
a 
yearning 
to 

bounce back.

“I think some 

of these losses 

are good for us,” said junior 
guard Katelynn Flaherty after 
the Wolverines’ loss to the 
Spartans on Mar. 3. “Coach 
says it kind of puts a fire in us. 
It’s definitely disappointing to 
lose (against Michigan State) 
after coming off the past couple 
of games where we haven’t 
performed like we would have. 
But we’re definitely determined 
especially 
after 
losing 
this 

game.”

Added Barnes Arico: “Our 

kids will bounce back. They still 
have an opportunity to be a part 
of the best team that’s ever been 
at Michigan. And I think that’s 
really important to (seniors) 
Siera (Thompson) and Danielle 
(Williams) to leave that legacy 
behind.

“So I know that they’re going 

to go out fighting and that we 
are going to regroup. And if 
we get selected... it will be the 
first time anyone on our team 
has ever been in the NCAA 
Tournament.”
