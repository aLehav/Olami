LSA junior Heather Martin 

was just 17 when her older 
sister Angie fatally overdosed in 

their family home, following a 
seven-year struggle with opiate 
addiction.

Martin 
said 
her 
sister, 

throughout her life, was always 
a bubbly, amiable person. As 

The captains of the Michigan 

football team and women’s 
basketball team, as well as 
former men’s basketball Fab 
Five member Jimmy King, were 
among those present at the first-
ever Maizefest Homecoming 
Pep Rally Friday evening on the 
Diag.

The crowd, made up of 

alumni, students and athletic 
staff, cheered and celebrated 
before the homecoming game 
against 
the 
University 
of 

Illinois, and went wild when 
the parents of head football 
coach Jim Harbaugh appeared 
on stage.

Celebrating their Wolverine 

pride, they chanted, “Who’s got 
it better than us? Nobody!”

The festivities, which also 

featured 
appearances 
by 

student performance groups, 
fraternities, 
athletes 
and 

famous alumni, were hosted by 
the Michigan Spirit Association 
and 
sponsored 
by 
Central 

Student 
Government, 
the 

Alumni Association and the 
Athletic Department, among 
others.

Featured 
performances 

included the percussion group 
Groove, the a cappella groups 
G-Men 
and 
Amazin’ 
Blue, 

the diabolo team Revolution 
Chinese Yoyo and a presentation 
by the Bicentennial Advisory 
Committee.

MSA vice president Cameron 

Dotson, a Kinesiology senior, 
said the idea for the pep rally 
came after meeting with various 
students during last year’s CSG 
election, when he ran as the vice 
presidential nominee for the 
Your Michigan party.

During the campaign, Dotson 

said he discovered how aspects 
of campus like a new football 
coach and a revitalized athletic 
program helped instill a great 
deal of school spirit among 

students, making him want to 
create a way for students from 
diverse student organizations 
and 
backgrounds 
to 
come 

together in their passion for the 
University.

“I really wanted to bring 

something to the University, 
to get people excited and bring 
something that would last on 
campus for years to come,” 
Dotson said.

Many alumni present at the 

pep rally, such as alum John 
Varterasian, 
a 
Birmingham 

resident, 
said 
they 
were 

surprised by the increase in 
different 
types 
of 
student 

organizations.

“They have a lot of different 

groups, 
different 
variety 

and lot of groups as alumni I 
really didn’t know existed,” 
Varterasian said. “So I thought 
it was pretty informative and 

Halfway through the fourth 

quarter, 
sophomore 
Karan 

Higdon broke loose down the 
right sideline and cut inward 
at Illinois’ 10-yard line while 
dodging 
defenders, 
leaping 

into the end zone for the No. 3 
Michigan football team’s final 
score of the game.

It was just one highlight 

on a successful day for the 
Wolverines 
(4-0 
Big 
Ten, 

7-0 
overall). 
Two 
weeks 

after crushing Rutgers 78-0, 
Michigan picked up where it left 
off, holding the Fighting Illini 
(1-3, 2-5) to just 172 yards to win 
41-8 on Saturday at Michigan 
Stadium.

Redshirt 
sophomore 

quarterback 
Wilton 
Speight 

had one of his best games of 
the season, going 16-for-23 for 
253 yards and two touchdowns. 
Higdon 
impressed 
as 
well, 

leading the running backs with 
106 yards, 45 of which came on 
his touchdown run.

“The entire game, I thought 

Wilton Speight may have had 
one of his best games,” said

AMANDA ALLEN/Daily

Members of the Michigan Mudbowl Club and Pi Kappa Phi participate in the 83rd annual Mudbowl, held at the former Sigma Alpha Epsilon house Saturday.

More 
than 
1,500 
people 

crammed into the confines of the 
front yard of the former Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon fraternity house 
on Saturday morning to watch 
one of the most time-honored 

fall traditions, for what could be 
the last time, at the University 
of Michigan: the 83rd annual 
Mudbowl.

The annual tradition, meant 

to raise money for C.S. Mott 
Children’s Hospital, used to be 
organized by the fraternity SAE. 
The 
University 
of 
Michigan 

banned SAE in 2015 over hazing 

allegations so SAE no longer 
officially hosts the event, but the 
Mudbowl is now organized by the 
Michigan Mudbowl Club, which 
is comprised largely of former 
SAE members.

The crowd standing alongside 

the former SAE house Saturday 
was watching what may have 
been the last time members of 

now-former SAE play in this 
event, at this location, due to 
impending 
graduations 
and 

the closure of the fraternity on 
campus. The house will be rented 
out by Alpha Omicron Pi, a new 
sorority coming to campus, for 
the next few years.

This year, more than $47,000

The University of Michigan 

has received a fair amount of 
attention from the Democratic 
party this election season, with 
visits 
from 
Democratic 
vice 

presidential nominee Tim Kaine 
and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.). 
However, there have been no 
surrogate or candidate visits from 
any other party.

The 
greater 
presence 
of 

Democratic campaigns may have 
a simple explanation — the high 
levels of support they find here. 
70 percent of students sampled 
backed Democratic presidential 
nominee Hillary Clinton in a 
recent Michigan Daily election 
survey.

Additionally, the University’s 

chapter of College Democrats, 
Students for Hillary and the 
Michigan branch of the Hillary 
for America campaign all have 
active ongoing efforts on campus. 
Prior to the deadline earlier in 
October, the groups focused on 
voter registration, often working 
together on drives. Now they will 
begin switching gears to get out

Families, kids and dancers 

gathered around the Cube for a 

afternoon of pumpkin decorating, 

dressing up and a child’s 

rendition of Michael Jackson’s 

“Beat It” Sunday, organized by 

University of Michigan student 

group Dance Marathon.

Dance Marathon, a student 

organization on campus, 

raises money for children with 

disabilities in Beaumont Hospital 

in Royal Oak and C.S. Mott, 

including a thorough 24-hour 

dance party toward the end of the 

school year.

Dance Marathon member 

Janie Brink, an LSA senior, said 

Sunday’s pumpkin carving is 

Dance Marathon’s kickoff event 

and was the first time members 

meet the families of the children 

at Beaumont.

This year was the first time 

Dance Marathon combined 

pumpkin carving with their 

therapy fair, which brings 

the hospital’s employees in to 

demonstrate physical therapies 

to children, while also allowing 

University students a personal 

look into how this process works.

“Participating and seeing the 

exact therapies they do kind of 

gives you a hands-on experience 

and shows you exactly how 

you are helping them and what 

they are doing to be helped,” 

said Dance Marathon member 

Chandler Rider, a Kinesiology 

senior.

LSA senior and Dance 

Marathon member Miranda 

Zeneli said the fair allows a 

more personal connection with 

families.

“It’s really cool because we 

get to see where all of the money 

we have raised goes to,” Zeneli 

said. “And it really gives us a 

chance to bond with the families 

for the first time.”

Brink said Dance Marathon 

combined the two events to lead 

to a bigger event so all donors 

and students can see where 

their money is going to, while 

also allowing the children to 

participate in more activities.

LSA senior Alayna Trilling 

echoed Brink, saying combining 

the events allows for more 

dancers to come to the events 

and learn more about the 

volunteering events Dance 

Marathon has to offer.

New dancers who came 

to meet their families theyre 

fundraising money for for the 

first time, such as LSA freshman 

Jane Wu, said they had a positive 

experience with the organization 

so far.

“I thought Dance Marathon 

was really cool because you get 

to stay up 24 hours with your 

friends and you get to bond and 

raise money for kids,” she said.

Beth Hoffi, whose daughter 

Kaitlin Betti-Hoffi has been a 

part of Dance Marathon since the 

first grade, echoed the sentiments 

of the dancers.

“It’s a great time for her to 

be around other children who 

are going through some of the 

same things she’s going through,” 

Hoffi said. “The students really 

make her feel special. It’s a really 

wonderful experience.”

Hoffi said Dance Marathon 

made her family feel special, 

citing a time where students took 

her son to the Big House after 

learning he was a big Michigan 

fan. Another time, students came 

to Kaitlin’s room after a surgery.

“They kind of go above and 

beyond than what is expected of 

them,” she said. “It’s a time for 

her to feel special, a little bit more 

independent, a little bit more 

grown up. And they kind of do 

what she wants to do.”

ON THE DAILY: KIDS AND PUMKINS MAKE FOR A FESTIVE CUBE

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
“It was pretty windy out 
there — it was tough to throw 
the ball. … He was throwing 
the intermediate-deep stuff. 
Thirty-yard throws, 35 yards, 
40-yard throws. Just on the 
money. It was impressive.”

Illinois 
finally 
got 
on 

the 
board 
in 
the 
fourth 

quarter when Fighting Illini 
quarterback 
Jeff 
George 

Jr. 
completed 
a 
43-yard 

touchdown 
pass 
to 
wide 

receiver Malik Turner after 
Michigan botched a fake punt 
on the play before.

The Wolverines were already 

ahead 
comfortably, 
though, 

thanks to a high-scoring first 
quarter.

The flashiest play of the first 

half came on the first drive. 
After lining up for his usual jet 
sweep, freshman wide receiver 
Eddie 
McDoom 
reversed 

direction, caught a pass from 
Speight and ran for 33 yards to 
set up Michigan’s first score of 
the game.

After redshirt sophomore 

Jabrill Peppers carried the 

ball twice to help move the 
Wolverines to Illinois’ 3-yard 
line, Michigan ran its “train” 
formation to fluster Illinois’ 
defense. 
Butt 
managed 
to 

find open space, and Speight 
connected with him for a 
3-yard touchdown pass to put 
the Wolverines up 7-0.

Michigan’s scariest moment 

occurred 
on 
the 
following 

possession, 
when 
freshman 

running back Chris Evans lay 
motionless on the ground after 
a hard hit from two Illinois 
defenders. Evans was able to 
get up with the help of trainers 
but went to the locker room 
immediately following the hit.

The 
Wolverines 
resumed 

their 
dominance 
on 
the 

following play, though, when 
redshirt freshman tight end 
Tyrone Wheatley Jr. scored 
his first career touchdown on a 
21-yard catch.

“I 
wanted 
to 
keep 
the 

football,” Wheatley said. “I 
didn’t let it go of it for a while. 
Everyone was jumping on me 
and slapping me in the head 
and stuff, and the ref was like, 
‘I need the ball,’ and I was like, 
‘Oh, here you go.’ I didn’t really 
want to let it go.”

Redshirt 
junior 
fullback 

Khalid Hill notched the final 
touchdown of the first quarter 
on his signature play — a 1-yard 
run — for his ninth touchdown 
of the season.

The second quarter started 

just as strong as the first, when 
just over a minute into the 
second quarter, freshman safety 
Khaleke Hudson deflected a 
punt to give the Wolverines the 
ball on Michigan’s 38-yard line.

That led to senior running 

back De’Veon Smith’s four-
yard scoring run that put the 
Wolverines up 28-0 with 11 
minutes left in the second 
quarter. Smith had 18 carries 
for 76 yards.

“I thought De’Veon was in a 

really good flow, good rhythm,” 
Harbaugh said. “Running hard 
(and) breaking tackles. We went 
more than what was planned 
with him, back to calling the 
same play, calling his number 
… based on how he was doing.”

While the offense impressed 

with 561 total yards, the special 
teams and defense made some 
big plays, too. Senior safety 
Dymonte 
Thomas 
picked 

off Illinois quarterback Jeff 
George Jr. to set up Michigan’s 
final score of the first half.

“Dymonte was outstanding,” 
Harbaugh said. “He read 
the screen as good as you 
can read it. He leapt up and 
made a great interception. 
I think Jourdan Lewis was 
applying pressure on the 
play. It was outstanding. We 
needed that turnover.”

Though the Wolverines 

weren’t challenged often, 
they did give Illinois a few 
chances. Fifth-year senior 
wide receiver Jehu Chesson 
fumbled 
on 
Michigan’s 

37, but the defense then 
stopped the Fighting Illini 
on four straight plays to 
regain 
possession. 
The 

Wolverines’ biggest misstep 
came in the fourth quarter, 
when the botched fake punt 
gave the Fighting Illini 
great field position at the 
Michigan 43-yard line.

But in a game when 

Illinois’ 
first 
completion 

didn’t 
come 
until 
four 

minutes 
into 
the 
third 

quarter — a gain erased by 
a fumble three plays later — 
the Wolverines were never 
threatened.

the vote efforts.

However, those have very 

little to do with attracting 
candidates or surrogate visits, 
and only coordinate after a visit 
is announced.

“It’s a very formalized process 

that is mostly done through 
the campaign,” said LSA senior 
Lauren Gallagher, Students for 
Hillary president. 

Cynthia 
Wilbanks, 
vice 

president 
of 
government 

relations at the University, said 
the student enthusiasm for the 
electoral process on campus has 
contributed to the visits so far.

“The 
reputation 
of 
the 

University of Michigan as an 
energetic campus with students 
who are very well-informed and 
eager to participate is a well-
known characteristic,” she said. 
“And as a result it is no surprise 
that this campus is one where 
candidates find themselves.”

Despite polling at 42 percent 

nationally, 
according 
to 
the 

RealClearPolitics 
polling 

average, Republican presidential 
nominee Donald Trump receives 
very little support on campus 
with the most recent Michigan 
Daily survey showing him at 
12.1 percent approval among 
students. 
Despite 
his 
poor 

performance, 
however, 
the 

University’s chapter of College 
Republicans retains its support 
for Trump and remains fairly 
active on campus.

Throughout 
the 
semester, 

the group has hosted debate 
watch parties and contributed to 
voter registration efforts across 
campus. However, this has not 
resulted in a major candidate or 
surrogate visit.

College Republicans President 

Enrique Zalamea, an LSA junior, 
wrote in an email interview with 
the Daily he is not surprised 

Trump has not hosted events 
on 
campus, 
but 
noted 
his 

organization has been involved 
with local campaigns and been 
invited to Trump events in the 
state.

“I 
assume 
Trump 
and 

Pence not visiting Ann Arbor 
is a strategic decision to focus 
on 
more 
conservative 
parts 

of Michigan, such as during 
Trump’s rally in Novi Michigan, 
and Pence’s Lincoln Day Dinner 
in McComb county; both of 
which 
(College 
Republicans) 

members were given admission 
to,” he wrote.

Traditionally, Trump prefers 

to hold rallies in large venues and 
has bragged about his ability to 
draw large crowds in comparison 
to Clinton. In his most recent 
visit to the state in Novi, he 
filled the Suburban Collection 
Showplace with approximately 
1,000 people. Given his low 
support on campus, hosting a 
rally here might not result in his 
normal audience size. Nationally, 
while Trump retains a minority 
of support group among college 
students, he has also been met 
with protests at a portion of the 
few campuses he has visited.

Wilbanks said the Trump 

campaign has thus far not been 
in contact with the University.

“From the position of being 

helpful of all candidates, I would 
say we have only heard from 
Secretary Clinton’s campaign 
team,” she said. “We have not had 
any specific outreach through my 
office from Mr. Trump’s team. 
Maybe there will be outreach for 
that type of activity, but so far 
that has not been the case.”

The lack of visits may also be 

due to different policy emphases. 
Clinton has repeatedly touted her 
higher education reform plan, 
which 
includes 
collaboration 

with Sanders and has resulted in 
tuition-free college for families 
who earn less than $125,000, 
a very popular notion among 

students. Trump, on the other 
hand, has not released a detailed 
plan relating to higher education.

Looking outside of the two 

major 
parties, 
Libertarian 

presidential 
candidate 
Gary 

Johnson has received a fair 
amount of support on campus, 
with the most recent Michigan 
Daily survey showing him at 11.7 
percent.

However, there is no formal 

support 
group 
for 
Johnson 

on campus, and nor has their 
been any interaction from his 
campaign.

Johnson has received limited 

attention throughout the election 
season, some of it for blunders. 
Johnson has campaigned at a 
few college campuses including 
a speech at Liberty University’s 
convocation and nearby Purdue 
University.

Comparatively, when Johnson 

ran in 2012, he embarked on an 
ambitious college tour across the 
country.

Nationally, 
Green 
Party 

presidential nominee Jill Stein 
has also gained the support of 
some young people, and has 
identified student support as 
an important part of her base. 
On the University’s campus, 
however, support hasn’t been 
very visible, and she polled at 3 
percent in the Daily poll. 

Stein has spent a fair amount 

of time campaigning at college 
campuses with a college tour 
in Maine and various other 
university stops, including an 
upcoming event this Friday at 
Eastern Michigan University.

Eric 
Borregard, 
Green 

Party 
candidate 
for 
state 

representative, told the Daily in 
a September interview that his 
party has seen an increase in 
support from young people in 
this election.

“I think it is decidedly younger 

this year than it ever has been 
because of the infusion of Bernie 
Sanders people,” he said.

entertaining as well.”

Other alumni, most of them 

recent graduates, were excited 
to see the groups they formerly 
belonged to perform onstage. 
Alum Ryan Bruder, an Ann 
Arbor resident and former 
Dance Marathon member, said 
watching the performances 
was a good way to reconnect 
with what the student group 
has been up to.

“For me coming back it’s 

good to get an update where 
people have been and where 
they’re going,” Bruder said.

Engineering junior Akshaya 

Rajkumar, Michigan Bhangra 
Team co-captain, said she 
appreciated how the event 
brought even the smallest of 
student organizations on the 
stage.

“I think it really shows 

how diverse our campus is,” 
Rajkumar said. “We’re a very 
small Indian dance team on 
campus so it’s really nice to 
be recognized in such a big 
platform.”

her addiction continued, though, 
instead of family remaining a 
priority as it always had been, 
getting her next bigger and better 
“high” took over, until one day 
— July 10, 2014 — they found a 
needle next to her unresponsive 
body.

“It was surreal for my parents 

in the way that all of this energy 
and time spent into her recovery 
was now gone; their daughter 
was gone,” Martin said. “It was 
definitely a shift coming back into 
reality, coming back from that 
world of heroin and opiates.”

Now, more than two years later, 

Martin still thinks about what 
life would be like had her sister 
not overdosed, noting the stigma 
that her family faced throughout 
her sister’s battle with addiction, 
which included numerous stints 
in rehab facilities, jail time and 
periods of drug testing.

“It was scary for me to try 

and come up with these lies to 
make us seem like we were a 
normal family that just couldn’t 
do certain things,” Martin said. 

“People caught on, but they didn’t 
really ask questions and that 
was probably one of the hardest 
parts… not knowing the line 
between wanting to talk about it 
but also knowing that if it’s talked 
about, people will look at you 
differently.”

Experiences 
like 
that 
of 

Martin’s family are growing in 
numbers both nationally and 
locally in Washtenaw County. 
In response, several initiatives 
within and surrounding Ann 
Arbor have been working to 
reduce opioid-related deaths and 
primarily raise awareness about 
what Martin calls a “silent opioid 
epidemic.”

Martin said she struggled 

entering her freshman year at the 
University of Michigan just two 
months after her sister’s death 
because she often faced the same 
common misconceptions about 
being family members of drug 
users do.

“I didn’t want to be that girl 

that was known in my town 
who, when you said your sister’s 
involved with drugs, you were 
automatically 
stigmatized 
of 

being bad and dangerous, and 
they couldn’t trust you,” Martin 
said. “Even though I had never 

touched a single drug in my 
entire life, it was still how I was 
perceived.”

Statistics from the Centers for 

Disease Control and Prevention 
show 
opioid 
overdoses 
have 

tripled nationwide since 2000. 
According to a January 2016 
report, opioids — particularly 
prescription 
pain 
medication 

and heroin — are the main drugs 
associated with overdose deaths, 
a statistic that was made apparent 
in 2014, the year in which more 
people died from drug overdoses 
than any other year on record.

Statistics 
from 
Washtenaw 

County are just as severe as those 
nationwide. According to the 
Washtenaw County Public Health 
Opioid Report from June of this 
year, since October 2015 there 
have been about 20 Washtenaw 
County residents overdosing per 
month, and 25 percent of these 
residents do not survive.

Additionally, opioid and heroin 

overdose data show there have 
already been 33 opioid deaths in 
Washtenaw County so far this 
year, more than the total amount 
of overdose deaths in the county 
just three years ago.

Health effects
Opioids 
change 
both 
the 

physiological 
response 
and 

behavioral 
mindset 
of 
the 

user after prolonged periods 
of dependency on the drug, 
according 
to 
Marci 
Scalera, 

co-chair 
of 
the 
Washtenaw 

Health Initiative Opioid Project. 
She said users begin to need the 
drug just to feel “normal.”

Martin said her sister was 

active in a number of activities 
such as dance, student council, 
writing and sports until she 
first began experimenting with 
marijuana at about age 15.

Once 
Angie 
began 
using 

harder drugs, Martin watched 
her lose interest in academics, 
quit the dance team and drop her 
application for the high school 
student council — changes Martin 
said were indicative of a “slow but 
downhill” spiral away from her 
priorities and morals. Echoing 
Scalera’s sentiments, Martin said 
Angie began to prioritize chasing 
a high as her addiction continued.

“It 
manipulates 
people 

into being liars,” Martin said. 
“Wanting that drug was her main 
priority in life. Everyone else was 
doing life with drugs on the side, 
but she was doing drugs and life 
on the side.”

Research

Mark Ilgen, interim director 

of the UM Addiction Treatment 
Services and research investigator 
in the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, said his research aims to 
assess the success of treatment 
methods for his patients, use a 
combination of modification of 
methods to personalize treatment 
and 
interact 
with 
substance 

abusers at an earlier stage of their 
use.

Ilgen 
said 
the 
recent 

prescribing of opioid painkillers 
in medical settings is much 
of what increased the use and 
misuse of these medications. 
University 
researchers 
have 

supported this notion — last 
February, researchers found that 
giving patients smaller doses of 
prescription opioid painkillers 
for medical reasons may prevent 
overdoses.

“When you’re talking about 

opioid 
use 
disorders 
and 

prescription opioid misuse and 
now heroin dependence, you’re 
looking at confluence of a number 
of factors that all increase opioid 
use over the last 10 to 15 years or 
so,” Ilgen said.

 

was raised from the members, 
the 
members’ 
families 
and 

the alumni of the fraternities 
competing in the qualifying 
tournament and the Mudbowl 
championship game.

Public 
Policy 
junior 
Josh 

Martin, a Pi Kappa Phi member, 
said the philanthropic efforts 
tied to it are what make the 
Mudbowl a special event.

“We raised almost $50,000 

this year,” Martin said. “It is a 
fantastic cause as (the hospital 
is) helping kids get better every 
day.”

Twelve fraternities compete in 

the week leading up to Mudbowl 
for a chance to play the Michigan 
Mudbowl Club on Saturday. Pi 
Kappa Phi ultimately beat out 
Phi Delta Theta in the 12-team 
championship Friday night.

For Kinesiology senior Alex 

Dolik, the game this year held 
extra significance for former 
members of Sigma Alpha Epsilon 
still at the University.

“This is the last one for us, 

basically,” Dolik said. “We are 
representing 150 years of (Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon) tradition that is 
not there anymore.”

Though this year the game 

felt extra special to Dolik, he 
emphasized that the Mudbowl 
also holds much significance to 
members of the University and 
Ann Arbor community.

“People think it is a fraternity 

event, but it is something way 
more than that,” he said. “It is 
80-plus years of tradition in the 
community and in Ann Arbor as 
it connects not just the students 
but the people at large in the 
community.”

After both teams’ fans yelled 

insults at one another, the game 
got underway with Pi Kappa Phi 
racing out to an 8-0 lead. However, 
the Michigan Mudbowl Club 
scored two quick touchdowns 
to reach a score of 12-8, with the 
ensuing celebrations resulting 
in fans falling in the mud and 
beer being spilt on spectators. 
Each team would score one more 
touchdown before halftime, with 
the score at the break was 20-16 
in favor of the Mudbowl Club.

Joey Burke, a student at the 

University 
of 
Massachusetts, 

Amherst who was visiting Ann 
Arbor for the weekend, said the 
first half of the Mudbowl made for 
a unique game-day experience.

“The 
atmosphere 
here 
is 

unbelievable and everyone is in 
the game spirit,” Burke said. “We 

have tailgates at (my school) but 
we don’t have the Mudbowl!”

At the beginning of the second 

half, with the crowd growing 
larger and celebrating among fans 
increasing, a large fight broke out 
behind one of the end zones. A 
group of about 20 traded punches 
with one another, leaving some 
fans bleeding and covered in mud. 
Players from both teams stopped 
the game to break up the fight to 
continue the game.

After a brief hiatus, the second 

half saw a dominant performance 
by the Mudbowl Club as the team 
held Pi Kappa Phi scoreless while 
adding two more touchdowns 
to its haul. In the end, the game 
finished 36-16 in favor of the 
Mudbowl Club.

For LSA junior Nick Cargill, 

a key organizer of the event, his 
team’s victory in the mud marked 
the culmination of a memorable 
day.

“It is great to be able to 

come out here and raise money 
for the kids and have one last 
homecoming with the people 
who originated the event and win 
one last Mudbowl,” Cargill said. 
“Having organized it, I put a lot of 
work into making this happen, so 
just to see it all come to fruition 
is beautiful.”

T

wo years ago, I joined 
ROTC on campus as a 
sophomore. That March, 

in 2015, the boy I considered to 
be one of my closest friends both 
in the program and in the school 
decided to take advantage of me 
one night after I had been drinking 
at the bars. I didn’t know what to 
think the next few days; I passed 
the night off as something that had 
happened before: I got too drunk, 
and mistakes were made. It wasn’t 
until I came back to school my 
junior year after a summer away 
from everything University of 
Michigan-related that I realized I 
wasn’t OK, and what had happened 
to me wasn’t OK.

I spent the first few months of 

my junior year feeling targeted 
and isolated every time I had to 
sit in uniform among my ROTC 
peers, and experienced panic 
attacks continuously. I felt unsafe, 
paranoid and scared of the other 
cadets. The military is built 
on trust, but mine had been so 
violated that I didn’t really know 
who in that entire room I could 
trust. I went to the Sexual Assault 
Prevention and Awareness Center 
soon after school began, asked for 
help and started seeing a therapist 
who I still see today. She later told 
me I had been diagnosed with 
PTSD, something that at the time I 
only associated with war veterans 
and people who had been nearly 

murdered in an alley behind a bar.

When I first went to my 

therapist, I refused to think of 
myself as a victim. I had been 
living a lifestyle of partying and 
drunken nights at boys’ places in 
college that hadn’t been a problem, 
until the boy was a friend and I 
had said no. Before, it had only 
been the assholes, my interactions 
with whom I could shrug off, 
convincing myself that I was using 
them as well. 

But actually accepting that 

I hadn’t had control over what 
happened that night in March was 
very difficult, because if I was a 
victim, then I was weak. It took me 
many long months of therapy to 
start appreciating the word victim 
for what it is. It has absolutely no 
bearing on me or my decisions, 
and is only a word to describe a 
person that someone else thought 
they could use. The label of victim 
does not define me, and it in no way 
means “weak.”

Toward the end of winter 

semester, just when I thought I 
might be able to move past the 
event and keep living my life how I 
choose, the same boy who assaulted 
me allegedly assaulted someone 
else. I felt terrible. When it’s just 
me enduring the pain, that’s OK, 
but if I had said something back in 
the spring, this other girl might not 
be having to go through the same 
thing I was.

She chose to file a university 

report against him, and I spent a 
month debating whether or not I 
should say something. I was still 

healing and didn’t think I’d be 
prepared to talk about him, and I 
honestly didn’t want to get him in 
trouble. I felt bad that I might be 
the one to end his military career. 
It wasn’t until another girl in the 
ROTC program came up to me 
and told me that she was scared 
of him that I concluded someone 
like him will only continue to 
hurt women, and he has no place 
having authority over people in 
the military.

So I spoke with a professor I 

trusted in the ROTC program, and 
things started to move very quickly. 
I was told nothing would happen 
unless I filed a report with the 
police and with the school, though 
I felt there was nearly no chance 
of that leading anywhere — it had 
happened almost a year ago, and 
was now only a he said, she said 
scenario. I decided to move forward 
and file a case with both the police 
and the University. 

The investigation led by the 

University took about four months. 
The school had set up measures the 
last month or so, keeping him away 
from ROTC and places we’d both 
be. But this year, my senior year, 
I’ve had to return to the program 
with him back in it.

I don’t hear of this situation 

happening too often, where a victim 
of sexual assault has to see and 
interact with their attacker after 
the fact, and is expected to work on 
the same team as them. Yes, it does 
suck. People in the program don’t 
bring it up anymore because he is 
back and, so I’ve heard, preaches 

his innocence. But I have a strong 
support system around me this year 
consisting of people who’ve heard 
of what he has been accused of and 
agree that it’s despicable, especially 
for a future military officer. They 
hear my side of the story without 
just assuming the guy who’s back 
with us in class must be innocent.

It’s very difficult having to share 

the space with him once again, but 
I’ve progressed so far this past year 
and I am really proud of myself. I 
have my moments where I have 
to leave the room in tears instead 
of continuing to sit in a SAPAC 
briefing and be told “sex without 
consent is not OK,” but for the most 
part, I’ve been so much happier.

For the first time in years, I can 

focus on my schoolwork, and I don’t 
feel like I have to drink four times 
a week to get rid of my thoughts. 
I have an amazing boyfriend just 
a few years after I thought that I 
was broken and incapable of letting 
someone grow close to me. I want to 
use my experiences to help prevent 
similar things from happening to 
others. That way, he does not win 
— I do.

Redefining victim: I say who wins

 
The promise of tomorrow

DAVID SCHAFER AND MICAH GRIGGS | OP-ED

F

rom campaigns for gender 
equality to expressions of 
discontent over past athletic 

policies, student activism is very 
much at the core of our university’s 
history. By uniting to advance 
positive 
change, 
University 
of 

Michigan students drive discovery 
and shape innovation.

As students, our ability to 

mobilize, both on this campus and 
beyond, speaks to the ethos of our 
student body — an ethos that John 
F. Kennedy recognized when he 
proclaimed from the steps of the 
Michigan Union that this University 
is endowed with a greater purpose. 
We’re at our best when we embrace 
the higher calling of our education 
and use our knowledge as a vehicle 
to drive progress. When we 
engage in critical issues, we blaze 
trails and set examples that are 
recognized by individuals around 
the world — University presidents 
and citizens alike.

Guided by this belief, we believe 

the time is right to announce 
the creation of the Leadership 
Engagement 
Scholarship. 
This 

scholarship, the first of its kind 
at the University, will provide 
financial awards to a group of 
emerging and established student 
leaders — undergraduate, graduate 
and professional — in any avenue 
of campus life with demonstrated 
financial need.

Our reason for launching this 

scholarship is simple: The ability of 
University students to write their 
personal stories is increasingly 
restricted by financial barriers. 
There are obstacles that exist 
in the way of extracurricular 
involvement: Some organizations 
require their members to contribute 
financially, while all necessitate that 
leaders dedicate large amounts of 
time without the pay. Owing to this 
opportunity cost, which is more 
pronounced against the backdrop 
of rising tuition and housing prices, 

students are often forced to forgo 
experiences outside of the classroom 
for paid work. On a national level, it 
is estimated that the average college 
student works about 19 hours per 
week. When students are pressed 
for time and money, extracurricular 
involvement is often the first sacrifice 
that students make.

There are students who are 

currently unable to participate 
in the rich extracurricular life of 
the 
University. 
These 
affected 

individuals lose out on invaluable 
opportunities to which they should 
be afforded — opportunities that 
otherwise might very well come to 
define their University experience. 
We know and embrace the unique 
and elevated significance of this 
type of involvement because we’ve 
lived it. We’ve developed as leaders, 
grown as people, and forged 
lasting friendships through our 
extracurricular membership, just 
as have many Wolverines before 
us. It’s worth noting, for example, 
that Gerald R. Ford was a member 
of student government, Lucy 
Liu was in a sorority and Adam 
Schefter wrote for The Michigan 
Daily when he was a student. 

The Leadership Engagement 

Scholarship is very much aligned 
with the mission, vision and 
purpose of the Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion strategic plan. This 
fund will function as a “tool of 
equity” by helping to better level 
the playing field for lower-income 
students in the extracurricular 
world. It’s also important to 
recognize that on-campus student 
leadership elevates our prospects. 
Extracurricular 
involvement 

provides students with a natural 
networking 
base 
and 
the 

opportunity 
to 
enhance 
their 

resumes — both of which often prove 
to be invaluable when students look 
for jobs and internships.

The 
scholarship 
is 
also 

appropriate as we prepare to 

celebrate Michigan’s Bicentennial. 
It builds off the nearly 200-year 
story of “this Michigan of Ours,” 
which, as we touched on earlier, 
has been told through countless 
examples of student leadership. As 
we begin to shape the University’s 
third century, we must embrace 
the belief that participation in our 
“uncommon education” should be 
open to all students.

Through this scholarship, we 

hope to realize a more diverse, 
equitable and inclusive tomorrow. 
We can’t, however, do this alone. 
While a small number of generous 
donors have pledged $100,000 to 
this fund, we need your help to 
achieve our goal of raising a total of 
$500,000 to make this scholarship a 
reality. This amount of money would 
provide annual awards to a group 
of 10 to 15 students. Pay it forward 
by sharing your story, advancing 
our student outreach efforts and 
engaging in our fundraising drives. 
Every donation is meaningful — no 
matter its size.

Among our favorite aspects of 

the University is the fact that here, 
at one of the finest universities in 
the world, we have always been 
about tomorrow. This is the essence 
of the Leadership Engagement 
Scholarship. It’s about creating 
opportunities for all, and expecting 
engagement from all — now and for 
the life of the University. Together, 
let’s marry thoughtful vision with 
concrete action. Let’s work to 
provide students with possibilities 
that are worthy of their promise.

W

hen 
it 
comes 
to 

the 
future 
of 

our 
country, 
few 

issues are as critical as our 
education system. An educated 
population is fundamental for 
everything, from our economy 
to our democracy. 
Yet, education policy 
has been a second-
tier 
issue 
in 
this 

year’s 
presidential 

campaign, and was 
not addressed at any 
of the three debates. 
Ask 
the 
general 

public, 
and 
an 

unfortunately large 
number 
of 
people 

won’t know where 
either candidate stands on the 
issue. Clinton’s policies are 
more fleshed out and her track 
record is more impressive, 
but in this case, what she has 
proposed to do once in office 
is ambiguous. While education 
policy is unlikely to change 
votes at this point, it’s time for 
our candidates to take a stand 
on education. One of them will 
be president, and they must 
be held accountable when it 
comes to the direction of our 
education system.

Let’s start by breaking down 

higher education plans. Bernie 
Sanders made student debt 
a big issue, and for the most 
part, 
Hillary 
Clinton 
took 

his position. She is in favor 
of “debt-free” public colleges 
with free tuition for any family 
making less than $125,000 per 
year. At half a trillion dollars, 
this plan will be paid for, she 
claims, by raising taxes on 
the richest Americans. She 
also believes students should 
spend about 10 hours per week 
working in order to help pay 
for their tuition. As a senator, 
Clinton introduced legislation 
to increase Pell Grant funding. 
While it is a good idea, it is 
unclear how she will pay for 
it, and that is where her policy 
must get more specific. In fact, 
Trump’s 
team 
has 
jumped 

on this and said her plan is 
impossible. 
Trump’s 
policy 

adviser, Sam Clovis, says that 
government itself should not 
be involved in providing loans 
to students and that it should 
be banks doing so; this would 
be a disaster. Besides this 
point, contrasted with Clinton’s 
more 
specific 
plan, 
Trump 

has said very little. Trump’s 
policy positions get even more 
confusing when we go to another 
important topic in education.

Charter schools are a very 

contentious 
issue. 
Clinton 

has changed her opinion on 
charter schools throughout the 
years. As first lady in 1999 she 
told the National Education 

Association to “stand behind 
the 
charter 
school 
public 

school movement.” In 2008, as 
a candidate for president, she 
had a more qualified support 
of charter schools, as she was 
in favor Public School Choice 

programs 
and 

experimenting with 
different 
options, 

but 
said 
charter 

schools 
can’t 
be 

allowed 
to 
drain 

resources 
from 

public 
schools. 

While 
she 
has 

been in favor of 
charter schools in 
the past, today she 
seems much more 

reserved. Last November, she 
said charter schools do not help 
those who need them the most, 
and by investing more in the 
public education system, we 
can create better public schools 
from which parents can choose. 
Call it evolving over decades in 
public service or call it appeasing 
the two biggest teacher unions 

— both of which have endorsed 
her — but one thing is for sure: 
Clinton has changed her rhetoric 
on school choice. Where she 
would stand is unclear and 
dependent on her selection of 
secretary of education.

On the flipside, aligning 

with 
most 
conservative 

policymakers, Donald Trump 
has been steadily in favor 
of more school choice. He 
believes the education system 
needs 
more 
competition: 

“If you forced schools to 
get better or close because 
parents didn’t want to enroll 
their kids there, they would 
get 
better.” 
To 
increase 

enrollment at charter schools, 
he would move $20 billion 
in existing federal dollars to 
promote a voucher program 
that would enable kids in 
poverty 
to 
attend 
charter 

schools. This, according to 
many Democrats, would take 
funds away from current public 
schools and would deprive 
the schools of much-needed 
resources. Trump is staunchly 

pro-charter school and pro-
voucher programs. And while 
it seems like Clinton is in favor 
of a qualified and experimental 
charter school program, she is 
vehemently against the voucher 
program, as she thinks it will 
take funds away from public 
schools that need it most.

A third issue that both 

candidates could be clearer on 
is pre-kindergarten education. 
Clinton wants to make pre-K 
universal and double the Head 
Start program, which helps 
low-income students in their 
early years in school. The plan 
would likely cost $75 billion. 
If there’s one primary issue 
for Clinton, it’s here. She 
started in law school, where 
she worked for the Children’s 
Defense Fund and continued 
as first lady of Arkansas, where 
she started home visiting for 
new mothers in poverty. She 
made a huge difference as 
first lady of the United States, 
where she pushed for the 1997 
State Child Health Insurance 
Program and the Early Head 
Start 
program, 
which 
help 

more than 8 million children. 
Additionally, her first book, “It 
Takes A Village,” concerns early 
childhood investment. As The 
Atlantic puts it: “For the first 
time in U.S. history, Americans 
may be about to elect a president 
whose signature issue is early 
childhood.” On the contrary, it 
seems that Trump is severely 
lacking in a history of education 
initiatives. In fact, an article in 
U.S. News and World Report 
reported, “As for Donald Trump, 
his primary track record on 
early 
childhood 
education 

seems to be the number of times 
other people have compared 
him to a preschooler.”

Our 
education 
system 

determines 
our 
country’s 

future, and it’s been ignored. 
While 
neither 
candidate 

has 
talked 
enough 
about 

education to hammer down 
all their plans, we can look at 
history for an idea of where 
the two candidates stand. 
Clinton has spent her entire 
life advocating for childhood 
education, while Trump has 
spent the entire campaign 
defending his only experience 
in 
education: 
Trump 

University. We have outlines 
of plans, but when it comes 
to how they will change our 
education system, we have very 
few specifics. This is not OK; 
we must prioritize education 
policy and the discussion of 
such policy if we want to make 
any improvements.

Whitney began more or less 

as a songwriting experiment 
between housemates (and former 
Smith 
Westerns 
bandmates) 

Julien Ehrlich and Max Kakacek 
following an intense series of 
breakups. Both of them split 
with girlfriends; Smith Westerns 
disbanded; 
and 
Ehrlich 
left 

Unknown 
Mortal 
Orchestra, 

for 
whom 
he 
previously 

played 
drums. 
Though 
the 

circumstances 
surrounding 

the writing of Light Upon the 
Lake were bleak, the album is 
anything but. Centered around 
Ehrlich’s lofty croon, Kakacek’s 
easy guitar grooves, and the 
occasional brass flair provided 
by trumpeter Will Miller, Light 
Upon the Lake is the idyllic, 
nostalgic summer upon which 
we longingly look back.

Beginning in January 2016, 

after the release of single “No 
Woman,” the band has toured 
extensively across Europe and 
the United States with few 
pauses, sometimes playing more 
than one show a day. On October 
16, the band played at Pyramid 
Scheme in Grand Rapids. The 
members 
of 
this 
country-

informed, 
soul-infused, 
rock 

‘n’ roll six-piece outfit are out 
to make a name for themselves. 
It’s a good thing their abilities 
match — if not outpace — their 
ambition.

Following 
opener 
Sam 

Evian’s appropriately whimsical 
set, Whitney opens with “Dave’s 
Song,” a jangly, melancholic plea 
to an ex-lover. Based solely on 
lyrical content, one would think 
that a Whitney show could 
easily devolve into an intensely 
sorrowful affair. Thankfully, the 
band’s energy, up-for-whatever 
attitude and apparent failure 
to take themselves seriously all 
ensure that the net emotional 
effect is positive. Covers of Bob 
Dylan’s “Tonight I’ll Be Staying 
Here with You” and NRBQ’s 
“Magnet” also help to lift the 

mood while testifying to the 
band’s relative range and acting 
as a humble acknowledgement 
of their roots.

At one point in the show, 

Ehrlich pauses for a moment to 
remind the crowd that this is the 
last stop on the North American 
leg of the tour; he wants to 
make 
it 
something 
special. 

Immediately 
following 
this, 

members of Sam Evian come on 
stage with a shot of whiskey for 
every performer, and the result 
is strangely affecting. At once 
a celebration of a good several 
months and a farewell between 
bands, that communal shot is a 
poignant reminder of the more 
immediately human side of what 
it means to be a musician.

Whitney then invites the Sam 

Evian members to stay onstage 
with them to help play “Red 
Moon,” an instrumental track 
whose studio cut is just over 
two minutes long. Of the songs 
on the album itself, “Red Moon” 
is, frankly, the most boring. 
Performed live, however, it is 
absurdly and purely fun, with 
more than half of the band 
playing unique solos that don’t 
appear on the recorded version.

Before beginning the song, 

Ehrlich notes that someone 
tweeted at Whitney’s account 
that they would buy ten albums if 
the band played “Red Moon” for 
ten minutes. A middle-aged man 
from the front row volunteers 
himself as said tweeter and, 
after only a moment’s hesitation, 
the band agrees to give it a shot. 
Kakacek plays two solos; Miller 
plays two solos; pianist Malcolm 
Brown plays two solos; Evian 
plays two solos; Evian’s backing 

guitarist plays two solos. And 
when the timer hit ten minutes 
exactly, the band stops. “Thanks 
for making us do that,” Ehrlich 
smiles, “but you don’t have to 
buy the albums.”

Given that Whitney only has 

one album of material, they 
played it all. The driving “No 
Matter Where We Go” was 
cleanly executed and had half 
of the room dancing. “Golden 
Days” — “this song is about 
having a girlfriend, and then, 
y’know, not having a girlfriend” 
— serves as an anchor for 
the show, perhaps the band’s 
most 
well-developed 
song. 

Following “Golden Days,” the 
band plays “The Falls” — “it’s 
about partying too hard and not 
knowing who you are.”

During “Polly,” which has 

become another trademark of 
their live show, Ehrlich and 
bassist Josiah Marshall share 
a 
several-seconds-long 
kiss. 

Feel free to guess at what the 
intent is, but it certainly livens 
up the show. After exhausting 
most of their material, Ehrlich 
announces that he is sick of “fake 
encores,” and that the band will 
just stay onstage and play three 
more songs. After roughly an 
hour, the band closes on “No 
Woman,” during which Ehrlich 
introduces each of the members 
and offers a shout-out to Sam 
Evian. He addresses the crowd: 
“Let’s hang out afterwards. 
Grand Rapids is a sick city.”

Whitney 
itself 
is 
a 
new 

project, but the experience of 
each of the members is clearly 
reflected. They are confident 
in the niche they have carved 
out for themselves and they 
know exactly what they want 
to accomplish. After having 
seen them three times, my 
desire to experience their live 
performance has not abated 
in the slightest. They are a 
band who know what live 
performance is meant to be: 
never the same experience, even 
when the same band performs 
in the same venue only months 
apart.

Whitney closes out North American 
tour leg at Grand Rapids concert

Indie band brings unexpected high energy and fun to Michigan

To 
hear 
Republican 

presidential candidate Donald 
Trump say it, the media is 
totally “rigged against me.” 
Despite his unending stream 
of complaints, and his recent 
performances in the debates 
notwithstanding, Trump is 
highly adept at using the media 
to elevate his campaign. If his 
mantra is that all press is good 
press, Trump has certainly 
been profoundly successful; 
television, 
newspapers 
and 

websites are more saturated 
with his face than a North 
Korean 
publication 
may 

feature their Dear Leader. 
But in the primary, as he used 
bombastic language to attract 
the attention of oft-ignored 
segments of the electorate, 
Trump’s floor rose as his 
ceiling fell. Thanks to the 
media, 
Trump 
eliminated 

any ambiguities about his 
campaign to the point where 
Trump has garnered support 
from everyone who should 
support him and few else.

This is all to say the obvious: 

the media is important. As our 
primary method of learning 
about our world, every choice 
made by the supposed media 
elite can majorly affect the 
campaign, our politics and 
everything else.

In 
“Medium 
Cool,” 
the 

fascinating 
directorial 

debut 
from 
legendary 

cinematographer 
Haskell 

Wexler (“Days of Heaven”), 
reality and fiction seamlessly 
blur into one another against 
the tumultuous backdrop of 
the chaotic 1968 Democratic 
Convention 
in 
Chicago. 

“Medium Cool” doesn’t have 
too much to say substantively 
about the media itself, but 
its brief conspiratorial turn 
remains a prescient warning: 
John 
Cassellis 
(Robert 

Forster, “Jackie Brown”), a 
cameraman for a local news 
station, discovers that his boss 

has been giving information 
captured by the cameramen 
to the FBI, allowing them 
to arrest demonstrators and 
protestors.

Maybe that’s why there’s a 

lurking threat to journalists 
throughout the film: stories 
of journalists being beaten 
for 
rumors 
of 
conspiring 

with 
the 
government, 

accusing cameramen of being 
cops in disguise. There’s a 
fundamental distrust of the 
media, of powerful voices, 
because one editorial choice 
could 
depict 
the 
rioting 

protestors 
as 
unjustified 

savages. But, on the other 
side of the coin, these rioters 
need the media to transmit 
their message throughout the 
country.

And in a larger sense, 

“Medium Cool” is a metaphor 
for this editorial power. The 
film takes place during the 
1968 riots, but it was literally 
filmed at and during them. At 
one point, when a cop throws 
some gas at protestors, a 
crewman on the film shouts, 
“Look out Haskell, it’s real!” 
And yet the narrative of the 
story (albeit a fairly weak 
one) persists through these 
scenes. It’s impossible to tell 
where the documentary ends 
and where the drama begins, 
and perhaps that’s precisely 
the point: the news, by its 
nature of being condensed and 
edited, is defined more by its 
artifice than its accuracy. And 
yet its effect is potent as ever.

Conrad Brean, the genius 

spin 
doctor 
played 
by 

Robert De Niro (“The Deer 

Hunter”) in Barry Levinson’s 
1997 film “Wag the Dog,” 
understands the artifice of 
news more than anybody. A 
true October surprise, the 
sitting president’s re-election 
campaign is set to be derailed 
by a child sex scandal after 
the president makes advances 
on a visiting “Firefly Girl.” 
Fearful that the news may 
begin to cover the story 
obsessively, the president’s 
press office hires Brean to fix 
the problem.

With a connection to a 

wealthy Hollywood producer, 
Stanley 
Motss 
(Dustin 

Hoffman, “The Graduate”), 
Brean decides to set up a 
fake 
diversionary 
war 
in 

Albania. He films a brief 
scene of destruction in front 
of a blue screen and sends 
it to every major network. 
Soon enough, it’s the major 
story every day until Election 
Day. 
Brean 
declares 
early 

on that we remember the 
images of war, not the war 
itself. His team follows that 
mantra extensively, creating 
symbols 
and 
heroes 
that 

contribute to and extend their 
manufactured narrative. With 
access 
to 
the 
presidential 

office, 
and 
thus 
infinite 

power, Brean’s team is able 
to 
construct 
a 
hyper-real 

alternative reality, even if it 
results in a few casualties and 
actual war in Albania soon 
after the election.

They understand that, for 

the story to catch on and last 
for a number of days, it must 
fit the public’s demand for 
entertainment. Like or unlike 
(you decide) Trump’s tendency 
to 
say 
patently 
ludicrous 

statements that provoke more 
than an eyeroll, Brean has an 
obsessively calculative mind 
that can automatically create 
the perfect narrative. It’s a 
clear answer to the question 
for those who are frustrated 
by what they perceive to be 
a lack of Clinton scandal 
coverage in the media: it’s not 
entertaining enough.

Media’s sway on elections

DANIEL HENSEL

How cinema characterizes entertainment and Washington

The last weekend of October 

will 
be 
a 
special 
one 
in 

Kerrytown, and not 
just because of the 
emerging fall colors 
or 
Halloween 

festivities. 
Edgefest, a four-
day 
avant-garde 

jazz 
festival 

that 
will 
occur 

that 
weekend, 

is 
described 
on 

its website as a 
“festival 
with 
a 

unifying 
purpose: 

to 
explore 
new 

music 
created 
by 
today’s 

composer 
s 
and 
performers 

from the United States and 
beyond.” Edgefest will be filled 
with 
groundbreaking 
jazz 

performers — including those 
who don’t stick with a script. 

Andrea 
Wolper, 
Ken 

Filiano and the late Connie 
Crothers are three individual 
jazz artists, each acclaimed 
for separate musical talents 
and accomplishments. When 
together, though, they form 
an 
improvisational, 
avant-

garde jazz assemblage called 
TranceFormation. 
While 

almost all of the performers at 
Edgefest offer a unique take on 
jazz music, TranceFormation 
offers the unpredictable.

Although each musician is 

based out of New York, the group 
had their debut performance 
in 2006 in Ann Arbor. Wolper, 
the vocalist of the group, has 
been called one of the “great 
jazz singers.” While her work 

outside 
of 
TranceFormation 

is less avant-garde and more 
straight-ahead 
jazz, 
Wolper 

said her goal in performing 
with TranceFormation is “to 
express — express something. 

Not just notes 
and 
pitches.” 

While it seems 
to the average 
person 
that 

improvised live 
performance 
could take quite 
a toll, Wolper 
embraces 
the ability to 
express herself 
in both types of 
performances.

“I love all of 

it,” she said.

Much of Wolper’s inspiration 

for expressing herself stems 
from TranceFormation’s late 
pianist, 
Connie 
Crothers. 

Crothers passed away in August 
of this year, but still plays a large 
role in the group. She was often 
heard telling musicians she 
worked with that performing 
and making music is all about 
feeling 
— 
TranceFormation 

takes 
Crothers’s 
piece 
of 

wisdom and extends it to each 
of their performances.

Filiano, the group’s bassist 

(and Wolper’s husband), also 
draws 
his 
relationship 
to 

performance from Crothers’s 
views, 
and 
stresses 
the 

importance 
of 
“always 

sounding like who you are.” 
A 
major 
precursor 
for 
a 

successful 
performance, 
he 

said, is knowing the history of 
the music you’re playing so that 
you can fill a unique position in 
the music itself. 

TranceFormation’s 
debut 

performance 
was 
also 
in 

Ann 
Arbor, 
at 
the 
2006 

International 
Society 
for 

Improvised Music’s inaugural 
conference, held in Ann Arbor. 
And, in a bittersweet fashion, 
their last performance may be 
in Ann Arbor this week. While 
Crothers’ talent and wisdom 
will continue to make an impact 
on Wolper and Filiano, the 
two agreed that the group was 
defined by the three musicians 
performing 
and 
expressing 

themselves as a trio.

“TranceFormation was the 

three of us … There is no going 
backwards,” Filiano said.

Wolper 
added 
that 
the 

music TranceFormation made 
together was too personal to 
replicate in another group.

“If we (decided to) find 

another 
pianist 
and 
make 

a group, it could absolutely 
happen. But it would be a 
different group,” she said.

Fittingly, 
their 
last 

performance will be a tribute 
to Crothers. Although this will 
not be TranceFormation’s first 
performance as a tribute to 
Crothers, it will be their final. 
Wolper notes the importance 
of playing “in a way that would 
honor her,” which will include a 
piece comprised of some words 
Crothers had written down on 
a piece of paper for Wolper in 
the past.

“Maybe this performance is 

a way of saying this group was, 
and is no longer,” Wolper said. 

TranceFormation’s 
tribute 

to Connie Crothers is October 
27 at 7:00 PM at the Kerrytown 
Concert House, as a part of the 
20th annual Edgefest Festival.

CONCERT REVIEW

Each member 

of Whitney 

brings their own 

experience.

REEL POLITICS

There’s a 

fundamental 
distrust of the 

media.


American 
Football’s 
first 

release in 17 years begins softly, 
with 
a 
quietly 

crescendoing 
set 
of 
chimes 

that 
reverberate 

through the ears. 
The 
delicacy 
of 

the noise evokes 
thoughts 
of 

tinkling 
wind 

chimes dancing in 
the wind, reminiscent of a sun 
soaked warm welcome back 
home after a long and tiring 
adventure.

The group was originally 

active from 1997 to 2000, 
releasing their first self-titled 
LP in 1999 and a few other 
works before disbanding. In the 
years since, the members have 

been 
working 

on 
separate 

ventures.

 LP2 has a 

gentle 
sound, 

fueled by Mike 
Kinsella’s 
burnished 
yet 
powerful 

voice, 
silky 

with honeyed nostalgia. Slow 
buildups 
and 
lulls 
in 
the 

sound blended with slightly 
unexpected vocal harmonies, 

steady and persistent bass and 
Steve 
Lamos’s 
multifaceted 

drumming are magnetizingly 
immersive, striking a perfect 
balance and ensuring that the 
vocals are never drowned out 
by the instrumentals.

American Football has a 

distinct imprint on the emo 
scene in part for their obscure 
time signatures, which lend the 
music an asymmetrical quality 
that not only complicates the 
instrumental 
line 
but 
also 

creates a complex, many-sided 
listening experience. In some 
of the songs, the guitars play 
on a completely different time 
signature from the drums. The 
irregular beats are particularly 

audible in “Give Me the 
Gun,” especially in the parts 
of the piece where Kinsella’s 
voice 
fades 
away 
and 

drumming takes the stage. 

Not every track is slow-

paced, 
however. 
“Desire 

Gets In The Way,” track eight 
on the LP, has a noticeably 
more 
upbeat 
sound 
in 

comparison to the rest of 
the 
collection. 
Lighter, 

dancing guitar notes and 
quicker drumming are at 
the forefront of the song as 
Kinsella proclaims “ Desire 
gets in the way / you can’t 
hide such an ugly trait.” 
The bridge of the song is 
surprisingly mellow as most 
of the instrumentals vanish 
and 
Kinsella 
tenderly 

sings “For you, I’ll remain 
/ chained to the bed we 
made.”

It’s rare for a group to 

come back full force after 
a breakup, and rarer still 
to do so after a 17 year long 
hiatus. With LP2’s warm, 
undulating sound, American 
Football proves that they 
are more than ready for the 
challenge.

O

n 
TV, 
conflict 
and 

confrontation 
are 

central. 
Any 
major 

conflict being raised is treated like 
a promise that must be delivered 
on, and if it’s never addressed, it’s 
bad TV. Almost any 
time the possibility 
of a new romantic 
pairing is floated, for 
example, those two 
people will end up 
together, even if it’s 
just one hook-up that 
never becomes more.

Most TV creates 

the false perception 
that 
interpersonal 

conflict 
is 
largely 

built on a series of dramatic 
arguments. If people keep their 
petty resentments inside and let 
them fester without confronting 
each other, eventually it’ll blow 
up into an even more explosive 
confrontation. In the real world, of 
course, most interpersonal conflicts 
are more subtle and low-scale.

In fact, in the age we live in, 

a lot of indicators of conflict 
between people come from tiny 
social media interactions. That’s 
something most TV writers avoid 
dramatizing, probably out of fear 
of the drama feeling too trivial 
and petty. But social media plays 
such a huge role in our lives now 
that it feels weird to ignore it 
entirely, especially because little 
social media occurrences can 
have surprisingly big emotional 
effects. When I haven’t talked to 
somebody in a long time, whether 
it’s because of a fight we got into 
or some subtle conflict, we often 
won’t Snapchat each other, won’t 
“like” each other’s Facebook posts, 
won’t acknowledge each other’s 
tweets. So if somebody randomly 
“likes” one of my posts for the first 
time months after a fight, it feels 

like a huge step forward, like this is 
them subtly reaching out to me to 
revive our lost friendship, or even 
just to let me know they’re not 
angry at me anymore.

But on TV, if a character 

legitimately 
felt 

sad that someone 
was liking someone 
else’s 
posts 
and 

not their own, that 
character 
would 

come 
across 
as 

the stereotype of a 
millennial teenage 
girl obsessed with 
the 
most 
trivial 

social 
media 

happenings. On TV, 

you have to create “real” drama 
to deal with. “That girl isn’t liking 
my Instagram pictures” is not 
enthralling drama. But it happens 
a lot in this modern world, so 
shouldn’t we depict it onscreen?

The best show at illustrating how 

important social media interactions 
can feel is “Man Seeking Woman,” 
an FXX sitcom that heightens the 
romantic travails of the average 
awkward 20-something guy to 
surreal 
degrees. 
One 
episode 

devotes a whole sequence to figuring 
out how Josh (Jay Baruchel, “This 
is the End”) should respond to a 
text; various consultants surround 
Josh at a conference table as if 
the fate of the world depends on 
what he sends. Michael Hogan 
(“Battlestar Galactica”) screams 
“Text ‘jk!’ ” repeatedly, and the 
stakes are extreme. But “Man 
Seeking Woman” works so well 
because it sets out to be fantastical, 
to be deliberately surreal to express 
how very real occurrences feel. 
It succeeds because it presents 
these seemingly trivial incidents 
in astronomical terms. Most shows 
can’t do that. Not every show can 
employ fantastical interludes like 

“Jane the Virgin” or “Man Seeking 
Woman” can, so these small 
internal conflicts mostly get left 
out.

Sometimes, I wish that life 

was more like TV. I wish every 
mere romantic possibility came 
to fruition, every conflict was 
exciting and every obstacle I faced 
would, in the end, result in me 
being a stronger, more resilient 
person.

I wish that, every time I was 

angry at someone for a justified 
reason, I would have the bravery to 
come out and confront them about 
what they did. I wish that, if I felt 
myself drifting from someone, I 
would immediately make a move to 
rectify it and not give a shit whether 
I came across as “powerless,” 
whether I came across as the 
person who gave more of a shit. I 
wish that, if someone was avoiding 
me or pushing me away, they would 
just tell me so I understood their 
motives. I wish that life was like 
TV, because on TV, motivations are 
usually clear, because everyone is 
always explaining themselves all 
the time. Most TV conflict could 
be solved by open and honest 
communication, and most is solved 
that way.

But in reality, the truth is 

that most of life isn’t built on 
confrontation. 
There’s 
long, 

drawn-out, lingering resentment 
that either comes out late or often 
not at all. There’s stuff that goes 
unaddressed 
because 
people 

are so utterly afraid of what 
consequences even bringing it up 
would have. A lot of times, there’s 
never really any closure. People 
have to move on without any neat 
tying of bows. Sometimes, the 
perfect cathartic confrontation is 
no more than a myth, a convenient 
storytelling device reserved for 
TV.

Contrary to what we see on the screen, life isn’t so dramatic

BEN

TV’s unrealistic focus on confrontation

The original “Jack Reacher” 

wasn’t exactly great. The dia-
logue was hammy and seemed 
like it would be more at home 
in a 1950s noir flick. The char-
acters 
straddled 

the line between 
boring and just 
plain 
unlikable, 

and 
the 
story 

was 
extremely 

run-of-the-mill. 
Director 
Chris-

topher 
McQuar-

rie, who would go 
on to work with 
star Tom Cruise 
again 
on 
last 

year’s excellent “Mission: Impos-
sible - Rogue Nation,” managed to 
breathe some life into the script, 
however, so it wasn’t a complete 
loss. But its sequel, “Jack Reacher: 
Never Go Back” isn’t lucky enough 
to have someone like McQuarrie 
to salvage the script. In the hands 
of director Edward Zwick (“The 
Last Samurai”), “Never Go Back” 
becomes a film that is less corny 
than the original but also expo-
nentially more generic.

The opening act of “Never Go 

Back” is actually relatively prom-
ising. Cruise and Cobie Smulders 
(“The Avengers”) have believ-
able chemistry, and the evolution 
of their relationship is shown 
through a montage of their meet-
ings by phone so that when she is 
arrested, it’s all the more under-
standable that Reacher would 
single-mindedly 
believe 
her 

innocence. Cruise and Smulders 

are the film’s greatest assets, as 
it turns out, because just about 
everything after those initial 
scenes is boring and forgettable, 
and it begins with the introduc-
tion of Reacher’s new teen side-
kick.

It’s not that young sidekicks are 

inherently bad. They aren’t, and 

they can be used to 
add further dimen-
sions to their men-
tors. Unfortunately, 
these characters are 
by and large vehi-
cles driven by angst 
and poor decision 
making, whose sole 
purpose is to act as 
damsels in distress. 
Such is the case with 
Samantha Dayton, 

played by Danika Yarosh (“Heroes 
Reborn”), who almost gets herself 
and everyone around her killed on 
at least three occasions and adds 
nothing to the overall plot besides 
an overwrought subplot in which 
Reacher, action hero extraordi-
naire, learns the value of family.

As nearly worthless as the 

Samantha character is, though, 
the villains of “Never Go Back” 
somehow manage to be worse. 
“Forgettable” barely sums up 
these men who hardly have 
names, let alone motivations and 
personalities. Robert Knepper 
(“Prison Break”) plays General 
Harkness, the main antagonist, 
who is on screen for all of two 
minutes, never giving Knepper 
the chance to make the unnerv-
ing impression that is his well-
earned bread and butter. Reacher 
and company are also pursued by 
a mercenary known only as the 

Hunter, who is about as mundane 
as his title implies and not worth 
the time it would take to criticize.

Still, “Never Go Back” could 

have been saved had Zwick craft-
ed an interesting action set piece 
or two. Again, the original “Jack 
Reacher” was nothing special, but 
the car chase between Reacher 
and the authorities was well-shot 
and legitimately exciting, hint-
ing at the talent which McQuar-
rie possessed. Zwick opts to go a 
different direction, in that all but 
two of the film’s spectacularly 
few “action” scenes are made up 
entirely of rapidly edited shots of 
pretty people running while being 
accompanied by generic chase 
music.

And “generic” seems to be the 

word that best sums up “Never 
Go Back.” Its generic plot is only 
unpredictable because the view-
er is so bored that they won’t 
bother to try to figure out where 
it’s going. Its generic characters 
come and go at the will of the 
screenwriter, creating many a 
moment of “Oh, right, that char-
acter exists.” Its generic action 
only serves to highlight what a 
tedious slog the whole thing is, 
instead of injecting any amount 
of excitement into the affair. Its 
generic villains barely feature at 
all and could be exchanged for the 
villains of almost any other action 
movie with no difference made to 
the plot. “Never Go Back” is not 
awful, but only because it’s too 
generic and mediocre in every-
thing but its lead performances to 
be truly awful. Instead, it settles 
for feeling more like a feature 
length “NCIS” episode than any-
thing else.

Michigan won the series 
opener against Michigan 
Tech on Friday, 4-3, and then 
rallied for a tie Saturday
» Page 3B

De’Veon Smith ran left on 

the first play. De’Veon Smith 
ran right on the second. Wilton 
Speight threw on the third. Jim 
Harbaugh threw convention 
out the window on the fourth.

Three plays were all it took 

for the Michigan football team 
to reach into its bag of tricks 
and runs circles around Illinois 
for an easy touchdown drive. 
Some coaches may have waited 
until later in the game. Some 
coaches may have waited until 
next week at Michigan State, 
a more formidable opponent 
than the Fighting Illini were 
in a 41-8 blowout Saturday at 
Michigan Stadium.

Harbaugh, of course, does 

not coach by convention. He 
didn’t hesitate to use three 
quarterbacks, play a defensive 
player at two positions and even 
roll out the now-famous “train” 
formation on the first series.

“Our coaches dial up plays 

for us that work,” said fifth-
year 
senior 
wide 
receiver 

Amara Darboh. “I think us 
driving down like that is like 
a statement — we always want 
to start off the game executing, 
not 
getting 
three-and-outs, 

going down and putting points 
on the board.”

The Wolverines began their 

first drive with the power 
running attack, which may 

well have been enough to win 
the game on its own. Smith 
ran over left guard for seven 
yards and then over right guard 
for nine. Redshirt sophomore 
quarterback 
Wilton 
Speight 

threw behind fifth-year senior 
wide receiver Jehu Chesson for 
an incomplete pass — and then 
he came out of the game.

In 
came 
redshirt 
junior 

quarterback Shane Morris for 
the fourth snap. He tossed right 
to redshirt junior running back 
Ty Isaac, then promptly ran 
right as a 6-foot-3, 213-pound 
lead blocker.

On 
3rd-and-4, 
freshman 

wide receiver Eddie McDoom 
entered the game, which looked 
like a return to the predictable. 
Michigan has run the fly sweep 
to McDoom almost a dozen 
times this season and hardly 
used the speedster for anything 
else. On this play, McDoom 
went in motion before the snap, 
and everyone in the stadium 
prepared for the same play. 
Instead, 
before 
he 
reached 

Speight, McDoom cut back to 
the outside, caught a pass in the 
flat and ran it for 33 yards.

The Wolverines weren’t done 

yet. In the red zone by that point, 
they inserted redshirt sophomore 
all-purpose man Jabrill Peppers 
as the wildcat quarterback — the 
third player to take the snap in 
a six-play span. He gained four 
yards. Sophomore running back

Cleaning up the Big House

L

ike clockwork, the cars 
start showing up at 7:30 
a.m. sharp.

Before that, the streets of Ann 

Arbor are 
quiet but for a 
single garbage 
truck. The sky 
is dark, lit only 
by a crescent 
moon. At 
Michigan 
Stadium, the 
lights are still 
on.

A few 

more garbage trucks circle the 
concourse inside the stadium and 
the parking lots outside, picking 
up the trash from dumpsters. 
Later, volunteers from Eastern 
Michigan will come to finish the 
job on the parking lot. And then 
there is the stadium bowl.

At 10 p.m. the night before, 

hours after the Michigan football 
team polished off a 41-8 win 
against Illinois, the bleachers 
were a mess. After every home 
game, it stays that way until early 
the next morning, when families 
from nearby Father Gabriel 
Richard High School come to 
clean it up.

Fewer than 600 students go to 

Gabriel Richard, but before sunrise, 
many of them are already in the top 
rows of the bowl. Often more than 
300 people come out to help every 
Sunday — today, that number is 323. 
One hundred ninety-seven of them 
will stay for Mass.

But the Catholic school’s 

religious foundation goes beyond 
Father Richard Lobert’s hour-
long service. In the mind of 
Cindy Pressprich, one of the 
coordinators of Gabriel Richard’s 
effort, the school pairs the clean-
up effort as a community event 
with the usual Sunday Mass. The 
students can even use the hours 
as credit toward their service 
requirement.

“It really has to put our belief in 

action about respecting each other, 
being charitable, believing the best 
about people,” Pressprich said.

Pressprich arrives with sign-up 

sheets and paperwork for all of the 
volunteers. The school has asked 
families to help out after five of 
Michigan’s eight home games this 
season. The Michigan Athletic 
Department pays Gabriel Richard 
— Pressprich doesn’t know how 
much, perhaps, she says, because 
it has been a near-constant 
agreement since the mid-1970s — 
through the school’s general fund, 
which helps defray tuition costs.

There’s little talk of 

administrative matters when 
everyone shows up in the dark, 
though. When Pressprich brings 
the forms, some families are 
already in the stands, using 
brooms or blowers to confine the 
trash to the lower part of the bowl. 

Then, other kids help out with 
picking up garbage, recycling pizza 
boxes and throwing away half-
eaten pretzels.

Meanwhile, Pressprich directs 

people at the entrance and 
co-coordinator Jerry Bonar drives 
a golf cart around the concourse 
to supervise. Both parents 
are central figures in Gabriel 
Richard’s effort, each with seven 
kids. Both have been helping 
for years, with some kids now 
graduated from college and some 
just entering high school.

Pressprich’s leadership 

at the front gates helps the 
operation run smoothly. Bonar’s 
enthusiasm — in the early 
hours of the morning after the 
Chicago Cubs clinched a trip to 
the World Series, he cried out to 
one volunteer, “Hey, hey, how 
’bout them Cubbies?!” — keeps 

everything upbeat.

It’s a tough job, but within two 

hours, the trash is all in bags at 
the bottom of the stands as the 
dumpsters come by to pick them 
up. The 197 volunteers all shuffle 
off to Sunday Mass at the Junge 
Center between the Big House 
and Crisler Center. Sometimes, 
Mass is in the north end zone if 
it’s not too cold. Those days are 
probably over for this year, but the 
temperature won’t keep Gabriel 
Richard away.

“Attitude is everything,” Bonar 

said. He recalls a famous quote: 
“Pain is inevitable. Misery is 
optional. Choose joy.”

For Bonar, though, it can also 

be tough to manage hundreds of 
volunteers.

“It’s the balance of motivation 

without any type of tangible 
reward,” Bonar said. “People go 

to work, recognition and money. 
I don’t have any money to work 
with. I just have recognition. I 
have thank-yous. I have a smiling 
face. I have enthusiasm. I have all 
those intangibles.”

Naturally, in cleaning a bowl 

that seats 100,000-plus, the 
Gabriel Richard volunteers must 
account for variables. When the 
Athletic Department renovated 
Michigan Stadium in 2010, it 
added space to the concourse, 
which now requires 30 or 40 
people to clean up instead of six 
or eight.

Stadium promotions 

sometimes add wrinkles, too. If 
Michigan hands out pompoms 
for big football games, Gabriel 
Richard shows up the next day 
to find thousands of them on the 
ground. Another time, the fans 
held up individual posters that 

together honored Lloyd Carr. 
Gabriel Richard had to peel them 
off the bleachers and clean them 
up. “That might have been the all-
time rough one,” Bonar said.

The biggest hope Bonar has 

every week, though, is for the 
weather.

“I don’t care what you have — 

(we want it to be) dry,” he said. 
“I don’t care if it’s minus-3. If it’s 
dry, we’re OK. Wet is the worst.”

Gabriel Richard has cleaned 

the bowl with 70 people and 
with 400, in hot weather and in 
cold. The seasons change over 
the course of the football season, 
sometimes until debris has frozen 
over on the bleachers and the 
volunteers have to chip it off.

But Bonar doesn’t have a 

problem with variability. That’s 
part of the appeal of the job — it 
comes after every home game, no 
matter the weather, no matter the 
year, between all kinds of people. 
According to Bonar, some parents 
who help out are chief executives 
or presidents of companies, but 
they still spend their Sunday 
mornings at the Big House. 
The families team up, three to 
a section, and it’s clear most 
everyone knows everyone else.

“We’ve got all walks, from the 

whole gamut,” Bogar said. “These 
folks could easily write a couple-
thousand dollar check and stay 
home, but they don’t, which I 
think is really good.”

Added Pressprich: “This is 

a pretty lowly task. Everybody 
wants to be better than garbage 
— I mean, ‘Why am I here on a 
Sunday morning?’ ”

In two weeks, Michigan returns 

home to play Maryland. At some 
point between the end of that game 
and nightfall the next day, the Big 
House will be spotless again. It 
doesn’t happen on its own.

JAKE LOURIM/Daily

Michigan Stadium ends Saturday still littered with trash from the game, but 300-plus volunteers come to clean up early on the morning after each game.

A tribute to Drew Sharp

The Detroit sports commu-

nity lost an icon this weekend. 
Detroit Free Press columnist 
Drew Sharp passed away at 56 
years old. He was many things 
to many people — a husband, a 
name to curse when you didn’t 
like what he wrote and a friend 
to so many in this business. It is 
my deep regret that I never got 
to know him personally.

What I do know is that 

Drew also once worked for The 
Michigan Daily. Traditions run 
strong at the Daily, and one of 
those traditions is a pervasive 
connection with the writers who 
came before you. So even though 
I didn’t know Drew personally, I 
felt that it was important to get 
to know who he was from those 
who did.

To them, he was a giving 

mentor. One of the younger 
writers when Drew worked at 
the Daily was Bob Wojnowski, 
now a sports columnist for the 
Detroit News. After Saturday’s 
game, I spoke with him.

He talked about a Daily trip 

to Champaign where they were 
snowed in after a basketball game. 
He said that Drew liked to leave 
the “mushy” columns for the 
other columnists. It was his job to 
hold the teams accountable.

I asked what Sharp would 

have thought about the “mushy” 
columns being written about him 
over the weekend.

“He actually would be the 

first, probably, to make a joke 
about it himself,” Wojnowski 
said. “So I’ll go ahead and say it, 
I think Drew left us because the 
Big Ten finally got good and he 
couldn’t stand it. He said, ‘Screw 
this, I’m getting out of here. Big 
Ten’s good? Really?’ ”

Sharp wasn’t at Michigan 

Stadium on Saturday to see the 
third-ranked Wolverines beat 
Illinois, 41-8. We’ll never know 
for sure what he would have 
written if he had been.

But we wanted to try to 

imagine, as a respectful 
homage to a Detroit sports 

legend and an alumnus of this 
student newspaper. So we 
asked Wojnowski: What would 
Drew Sharp have written about 
today’s game?

“He would have pointed 

out how sloppy they got in the 
second half,” Wojnowski said. 
“Guaranteed. Oh, and, he’s not 
wrong on this, what have they 
accomplished? They’ve won six 
home games, who have they 
beaten? And even next week, 
what will that prove? Michigan 
State’s bad, so who have they 
beaten? I guarantee you that 
would have been his angle.”

It’s an absolutely fair take to 

have, and one that’s needed, too. 
You didn’t always have to agree 
with Drew, and often, fans didn’t. 
But no one could argue he didn’t 
try to make you think.

So, here it is. No one can 

replicate Drew Sharp, or his 
irreplaceable style. But in his 
honor, we gave it a college try:

They got sloppy.
They went ahead, way ahead, 

and then the Michigan football 
team thought it could just go to 
sleep. The fans sure wanted to. They 
left early in bunches, and maybe 
that’s a good thing, because they 
didn’t have to see the Wolverines 
take it easy after halftime.

Michigan won the second half 

10-8, which was plenty enough to 
win, but if the Wolverines want 
to contend for championships, 
they can’t take their victory 
laps before the final buzzer. 
Alabama’s still out there, still 
a real powerhouse from a 
heavyweight conference, and 
you don’t see Nick Saban’s bunch 
letting up to Illinois.

Don’t let the final score obscure 

it. Michigan’s second half wasn’t 
up to snuff, not if the Wolverines 
are going to exorcise their demons 
in East Lansing next week in a 
game that should remind them it’s 
not over until the final buzzer.

This Illinois team was in a 0-0 

tie with Rutgers after the first 
quarter last week. In the end, the 
Fighting Illini won by just 17. And 
let’s not forget that Michigan beat 
those Scarlet Knights 78-0 the 
week before.

In that game, Jim Harbaugh 

refused to take his foot off the gas, 
going for two early and letting his 
backups run roughshod over the 
scuffling Scarlet Knights. Even 
if Rutgers wanted to stop them, 
it couldn’t. But on Saturday, the 
Wolverines took care of that 
themselves.

Harbaugh had new glasses 

this week, so he has no excuse 
not to have seen his team 
coasting a bit toward the end. 
On Illinois’ one touchdown, 
which was capped with a two-
point conversion, the Wolverines 
let the Fighting Illini look like 
a competent offense, lobbing 
up a 43-yard pass into the end 
zone right after a turnover. A 
turnover, I might add, that came 
because Michigan couldn’t corral 
a snap on a fake punt.

It wasn’t every Wolverine, of 

course. Karan Higdon flexed his 
muscle by powering for a 45-yard 
touchdown run in the fourth 
quarter. Wilton Speight came out 
of the game after three quarters, 
but until then, he didn’t let himself 
leave it mentally. He had one of his 
best games of the year, and that 
might get lost in the shuffle now 
because the rest of his team didn’t 
finish how it could have.

Illinois had 70 yards in the first 

half. That’s what championship 
defenses do to inferior opponents. 
But they do it for whole games.

This problem is not unfixable. 

Michigan’s still 7-0, and if it plays 
to its potential, who knows what it 
could accomplish?

Maybe, this will be a wake-up 

call. A reminder. A haphazard half 
that fans can look back on as the 
last time their team checked out 
early this year.

The Wolverines would be wise 

to learn that lesson fast. Michigan 
State is not good this season, but 
the Spartans are still next on 
Michigan’s schedule. And that 
should be the ultimate memory-
jogger. The games last 60 minutes.

Drew is gone, far too soon, 

and he leaves a gaping hole in the 
press box.

And even though we couldn’t 

possibly capture his Sharp wit, it 
will surely be remembered.

‘M’ defense shuts down 
Jeff George Jr. in rout

With Illinois’ third-string 

quarterback starting against 
the No. 1 defense in the country, 
the results of Saturday’s game at 
Michigan Stadium were almost 
a foregone conclusion.

But what Michigan coach Jim 

Harbaugh probably didn’t expect 
was to look up at the scoreboard 
heading into halftime and see 
that his team had allowed zero 
completed passes.

“That speaks volumes,” he 

said. “The pressure was good up 
front. I thought our guys really 
played well, executed extremely 
well. Really, (there were) just 
two plays that we did not defend 
well the entire ballgame, so I 
thought it was outstanding.”

Aside from two separate 

43-yard passes to wide receiver 
Malik 
Turner 
that 
helped 

the Fighting Illini finish with 
95 
passing 
yards, 
Illinois 

quarterback Jeff George Jr. 
didn’t stand much of a chance 
the entire afternoon. Though 
he was only sacked one time, 
George was pressured by the 
Wolverines’ 
talented 
front 

seven 
all 
afternoon, 
with 

players like freshman defensive 
end Rashan Gary and redshirt 
sophomore defensive end Chase 
Winovich reaching him so 
quickly that he had no choice 
but to hurry his throws.

The throws that did make 

it into the air didn’t have 
much success either, with the 
secondary’s four seniors — 
cornerbacks Jourdan Lewis and 
Channing Stribling and safeties 
Dymonte Thomas and Delano 
Hill — holding George in check. 
Likely due to his All-American 
reputation, Lewis was barely 
targeted, but each of the other 
three recorded a pass breakup.

Thomas 
— 
who 
has 

dropped a number of potential 
interceptions over the past 
few years — made the biggest 
secondary play of the day in the 
second quarter. On the first play 

after Michigan punted for the 
first time, George attempted a 
screen pass, but Thomas read it 
perfectly and jumped in front of 
it for his first career pick.

“The first thing that went 

through my mind is, ‘It’s about 
time,’ ” Thomas said. “I knew 
that my teammates, every day 
they always make fun of me. 
‘Dymonte, you can’t catch. 
You don’t have no hands.’ So 
as I caught that interception, 
they all said, ‘You know what, 
I’m gonna let you breathe, I’m 
gonna let you go. About time 
you caught it.’ It’s a pretty 
exciting feeling. I was pretty 
happy, pretty pumped.”

The secondary is talented 

enough to make plays on its own, 
but the defensive backs were 
quick to praise their pass rushers 
for making their jobs easier.

Defensive coordinator Don 

Brown’s 
blitz-heavy 
system 

has consistently kept opposing 
quarterbacks 
under 
duress, 

and the inexperienced George 
struggled to avoid the same 
fate. Thomas said the defensive 
backs knew George was capable 
of getting quick throws off, so 
they played tight coverage and 
waited for blitzing linemen 
and 
linebackers 
to 
create 

opportunities.

As for the few big plays 

allowed — such as Hill allowing 
Turner to outjump him for a 
43-yard touchdown — Lewis 
preached the importance of 
keeping a short memory. The 
defensive backs have allowed 
some big plays before this 
season, but they have yet to let a 
game spiral out of control.

According to Lewis, Hill 

shouldn’t 
have 
any 
trouble 

getting over the play, and 
Illinois’ late success through 
the air was simply a product of 
taking more chances. Still, given 
all the success it has had so far 
this season, Michigan’s defense 
has come to expect perfection.

“It bothers us as a defense,” 

Lewis said. “That’s exactly what 
we’re looking for — a shutout.”

Karan Higdon nearly broke one 
for a touchdown on the next play 
but tripped up at the 9-yard line.

Peppers made a cameo at 

running back and ran a flair 
route for five more yards, 
and then he switched back 
to quarterback and gained 
another yard.

Then came the train.
Michigan’s oddest formation 

— quarterback/lead blockers 
included — may be the “train” 
look it unveiled Oct. 1 against 
Wisconsin. It starts with nine 
players in a line behind junior 
center Mason Cole while Speight 
walks down the line calling the 
snap count. The nine players 
then move quickly into their 
positions and run the play. This 
time, Speight emerged from the 
train in an empty-backfield set 
and found senior tight end Jake 
Butt for the 3-yard touchdown.

Every week, the Wolverines 

have 
tweaked 
something 

new — more so than last year, 
when they didn’t use Peppers 
on offense until the Michigan 
State game in Week 7. Now, that 
game has come around again, 
and while Michigan has already 
shown plenty, it doesn’t appear 
that the ideas are drying up.

By now, the players don’t 

see the different formations 
as extraordinary. Peppers on 
offense? “That’s just a really 
good athlete playing the position 
like a running back would, or a 
wide receiver, or a dual-threat 
quarterback would.”

And the train formation? 

Speight admitted that’s a little 
bit out there. But, he said, “It’s 
pretty simple when you break 
it down and you rep it all week 
— it’s nothing to freak out 
about or anything.”

Either way, the third-ranked 

Wolverines are not done. After 
Michigan’s sixth home date in 
seven games, Harbaugh implied 
that his team can still do more 
as it heads into the final stretch 
of the season with three tough 
road trips left.

“It’s an ongoing process,” 

he said. “Never like to think 
the hay’s in the barn or you’ve 
arrived. 
Just 
keep 
forging 

onward.”

‘M’ falls to Buckeyes in 2OT

After 109 scoreless minutes 

marred 
by 
physicality 
from 

the onset, the Michigan men’s 
soccer team 
strived for 
a 
miracle 

goal 
or 

at least a draw against visiting 
Ohio State (3-3-1 Big Ten, 5-10-1 
overall) Friday night.

But with just 23 seconds left 

in the second overtime, Buckeye 
midfielder Ben Fitzpatrick tapped 
the ball from the top of the box to 
forward Nate Kohl on the right 
flank, whose right bender evaded 
the outstretched arms of diving 
Wolverines goalie Evan Louro. 
The ball finished in the lower-left 
corner of the net for the only goal 
of the game, ending Michigan’s 
bid to escape with a tie and one 
point in the process.

“We fought really hard from 

minute one, and it was just super 
unlucky at the end to concede a 
late goal after pushing numbers 
forward,” said senior center back 
Lars Eckenrode. “We had to get 
something out of the game, and 
unfortunately we got caught on 
the break late, but I thought the 
guys gave everything they could, 
and that’s all we can ask.

“It’s a really tough pill to 

swallow. We needed to win this 
game — we didn’t come out with 
any sort of points — so this is 
really a tough one, one of the 
toughest losses I’ve had to deal 
with in my four years here.”

Though a 1-0 result for a 

Wolverines team (1-5-1, 2-9-4) 
desperate for a win to rise in 
the conference standings was 
unfavorable, another chapter of 
the rivalry dramatically closed.

The chippy game featured 

counterattacks by both offenses, 
flying bodies on seemingly every 
attack and a combined 34 fouls. 

The officials issued four yellow 
cards – one in the first half to Ohio 
State defender Tyler Kidwell and 
three in the first sudden-death 
period. 
Michigan 
midfielders 

Tyler Anderson and Ivo Cerda 
each drew one, as did Buckeye 
midfielder Abdi Mohamed.

The pushing, shoving and 

other “extracurricular activity” 
from the opening kickoff was 
expectedly 
intensified 
for 
a 

typical 
Michigan-Ohio 
State 

showdown.

“It’s always going to be a 

physical 
game 
against 
Ohio 

State,” Eckenrode said. “There’s 
a little bit of tension between 
the two of us, that goes without 
saying. The Big Ten is a very 
physical conference … but today 
was a little bit more than normal. 
… I think it just adds to the 
excitement 
and 

to some of the fire 
that comes into 
this rivalry.”

Both 
teams 

tried to outmatch 
each 
other 

with 
speed, 

attempting long 
balls down the 
flanks 
which 

were 
easily 

swallowed up by 
the impenetrable defenses. After 
45 minutes, each collected four 
shots, none on goal.

In the 60th minute, the action 

picked up quickly on both sides 
of the field and continued as such 
for the remainder of the game. 
The Wolverines had two scoring 
chances in a one-minute span: a 
pass from senior defender Rylee 
Woods found freshman forward 
Jack Hallahan in the box only 
to finish high of the goal, and 
a ball placed into the box by 
junior defenseman Billy Stevens 
was headed wide left by Woods. 
The missteps led to a Buckeye 
opportunity on the counterattack, 

but 
Louro’s 
impressive 
stop 

preserved the stalemate.

Sophomore forward Francis 

Atuahene and Hallahan, noted 
for their speed and agility, 
were subdued by two or three 
swarming defenders each time 
they touched the ball. The 
attacking duo pieced together a 
combined nine shots yet totaled 
only one on goal.

However, Michigan pressed 

on, but were unable to capitalize, 
specifically inside the box. The 
biggest threat came with 2:30 
left in the second overtime 
when Hallahan stepped over the 
ball, spun around an Ohio State 
defender and shot the ball right 
over the crossbar from close 
range.

“We certainly went for it in 

the second overtime to try to 

find a way,” said 
Michigan coach 
Chaka 
Daley. 

“Unfortunately, 
we didn’t find 
it. We had our 
chances without 
question, 
a 

number 
of 

quality chances, 
a 
number 
of 

opportunities in 
and around the 

18, (that were) drastically in our 
favor and we didn’t take them.”

Daley 
characterized 
the 

result 
as 
“an 
unfortunately 

broken record” — another game 
that saw the Wolverines play 
hard throughout but come up 
short. Though they will be no 
consolation for the devastating 
loss, the final two regular-season 
games, both at home, serve as 
additional tests for the team to 
bounce back.

“It’s certainly unfortunate,” 

Daley said. “But we, as a group, 
have to continue to fight and 
compete and see how things go 
the rest of the way.”

Michigan no longer unbeaten at home

It was senior night, the last 

home game of the regular season 
for the Michigan women’s soccer 
team, 
and 

just 
90 

minutes 
against 
fierce rival Ohio State separated 
it from finishing the season 
undefeated 
at 
U-M 
Soccer 

Stadium. But by the time the final 
whistle blew, the Wolverines 
either lay on the turf devastated 
or held their hands to their heads 
in disbelief as the Buckeyes 
celebrated a 2-1 win courtesy of a 
stellar performance from forward 
Nichelle Prince.

“Anyone watching the game 

would’ve said Michigan were 
the better team,” said Michigan 
coach Greg Ryan. “They only 
had one chance in the first half, 
and one in the second that they 
put away.”

Despite missing star senior 

forward Nicky Waldeck, The 
Wolverines (5-3-2 Big Ten, 9-4-3 
overall) did in fact play some 
of their finest soccer all year. 
Playing a 4-1-4-1 formation, they 
stifled the Buckeyes’ midfield and 
played most of the game in Ohio 
State’s half.

Michigan 
created 
many 

chances, ending the game with 15 
shots. But for all their creativity, 
the 
Wolverine 
attacks 
were 

continually thwarted by Buckeyes 
keeper Devon Kerr, who ended 
the game with five saves.

“You gotta give their keeper 

credit,” Ryan said. “She made 
some fantastic saves, came off her 
line well and had a great night.”

For all the chances Michigan 

created, it managed to beat Kerr 
only once. Thirty-one minutes 
into the game, Martin, who 
was playing as a lone forward in 
Waldeck’s absence, turned and 
lost her defender just outside of 
the box to give herself time and 
space to shoot. Kerr was forced 

into a diving save but spilled 
the ball into the box, where 
sophomore 
midfielder 
Abby 

Kastroll pounced on the loose ball 
to tap it in and tie the game at one 
goal apiece.

For 
all 
the 
Wolverines’ 

dominance on the ball, Ohio State 
was content to counterattack 
and boot the ball up-field to the 
only player on the turf who had a 
better night than Kerr: Prince.

With every touch of the ball, 

every drop of the shoulder 
and every shot, Prince caused 
problems for the Michigan 
backline.

Charged with leading the 

defense against the Buckeyes’ 
counterattacks, senior defender 
Anna Soccorsi knew firsthand 
just how tough it was to stop 
Prince.

“(Prince) is just a great player 

overall,” Soccorsi said. “She made 
us work hard all night just to keep 
up with her.”

Prince marked herself as the 

player to watch just five minutes 
into the game in what was Ohio 
State’s first attack of the night. 
After neatly controlling a long 
ball, she kept the ball away from 
three Wolverine defenders and 
waited for support from her team.

With players making runs 

on her left and right to stretch 
the Michigan backline, Prince 
ran at Soccorsi and freshman 
defender Jada Dayne. Getting 
to the edge of the box, she took 
a shot that, though blocked by 
the two center backs, fell on the 
right side of the box in the path of 
forward Sammy Edwards who, 
unguarded, rifled a shot across 
goal into the side netting.

The Wolverines dominated 

what was left of the first half and 
were able to equalize courtesy of 
Kastroll’s goal.

With 
all 
the 
momentum, 

Michigan looked as though it was 
going to take over the game. But 
in what seemed like deja vu, Ohio 
State scored another early goal to 
start the second half, leaving the 

Wolverines trailing once again.

Prince grabbed a goal for 

herself just seven minutes into 
the half. After getting down the 
right wing, she sent a teasing 
low cross into the Michigan box. 
Soccorsi managed to get it out, 
but only as far as Prince, who 
sent a left-footed curler from 
the right side of the box toward 
goal. Goalkeeper Sarah Jackson 
managed to get a hand to it, but 
the power in the shot saw it end 
up in the top left corner of the net.

“(Prince) is a handful for 

everyone,” Ryan said. “She’s a 
fantastic striker, she’s even on 
Canada’s national teams. She’s 
been a handful for four years, and 
tonight she showed the quality 
she has.”

The Wolverines spent the rest 

of the half trying to find their 
way through a stubborn Buckeye 
defense that looked content to 
sit back, soak up pressure and 
play long balls to Prince, hitting 
Michigan on the counter.

Then, with just seven minutes 

left in the game, Prince found 
herself with space outside the 
box, roughly 25 yards from goal. 
She pulled the trigger, attempting 
to curl the ball over and around 
the keeper. Jackson remained 
static and looked to have been 
beaten as the ball sailed over her 
and crashed against the crossbar.

By that point the Wolverines 

had run of ideas, and whatever 
momentum they had seemed 
to have been lost as Ohio State 
comfortably saw out the rest of 
the game.

With two players on top of 

their game at either end of the 
field, the Buckeyes stole three 
points from under the noses of a 
Michigan team that visibly played 
its heart out on senior night.

“You can’t fault the intensity of 

the girls out there tonight,” Ryan 
said. “I thought it was some of the 
best soccer we played all year in 
terms of passing and connecting 
between the girls and playing 
through Ohio State.”

Wolverines tie Michigan Tech, win shootout

It was more of the same for 

the 
Michigan 
hockey 
team 

on Saturday. After losing the 
possession 
battle 
and 
being 

outshot 45-18, the Wolverines 
came roaring back on Michigan 
Tech, but ultimately had to settle 
for a tie, 3-3.

In 
the 
resulting 
shootout 

that will not count toward 
their record, though, Michigan 
prevailed, 2-1.

The deciding shootout goal 

came from freshman forward 
Jake Slaker, who fired a low 
shot to beat Huskies goalie 
Matt Wintjes on Wintjes’ glove 
side. On the ensuing Michigan 
Tech try, Michigan freshman 
goaltender Jack LaFontaine came 
up clutch with a kick save to send 
the Huskies packing. But the 
shootout win didn’t mean that 
Michigan doesn’t have plenty of 
places to improve.

“Michigan Tech was better 

than us on the game,” said 
Michigan coach Red Berenson. 

“I thought they were better with 
the puck, better without the puck, 
and I thought Jack LaFontaine 
kept us in the game. And then, a 
couple of good individual efforts 
salvaged the tie.”

After trailing late in the game, 

the Wolverines were able to even 
the score with 4:10 remaining. 
Junior forward Tony Calderone 
brought the puck up the left 
side into Michigan Tech’s zone. 
Calderone then left the puck out 
front of the net for freshman 
forward Nick Pastujov, whose 
shot was blocked. Junior Cutler 
Martin promptly finished off 
the loose puck, though, tying the 
game at three.

The game would eventually 

go to overtime, where there 
were multiple close calls, but 
LaFontaine stood tall in net, 
fighting 
off 
the 
onslaught 

of shots from the Huskies’ 
attackers.

“My number one thing is just 

to compete,” LaFontaine said. 
“Being in a situation like that, 
you’re tired — your legs are just a 
little bit heavier than they were 

in the first (period). So you’ve 
got to keep on competing. Good 
things 
happen 
when 
you’re 

working hard, and I think that 
showed today.”

Michigan’s first goal came 

in an area in which it struggled 
Friday: the power play. After 
freshman 
forward 
Will 

Lockwood drew an interference 
penalty from a Michigan Tech 
defender with a slick deke, the 
Wolverines found themselves 
with their first-man-advantage 
opportunity of the night.

Junior 
defenseman 
Sam 

Piazza fired a shot from the point 
that rebounded off Wintjes. 
Freshman forward Jake Slaker 
found the puck in traffic and 
dished it to Lockwood on the 
backhand, 
and 
Lockwood 

deposited it in the back of the 
net, putting Michigan up, 1-0.

Then, after Michigan Tech 

tied the game at one, senior 
forward Alex Kile got on the 
scoreboard. After winning a 
loose puck in the corner, Kile 
eluded a Huskies defenseman, 
fell to his knees and still 

managed to slide the puck into 
the net on the backhand.

The Wolverines held a 2-1 

lead entering the third period, 
but once again, they couldn’t 
keep the lead, giving up two 
goals in the final period before 
ultimately answering back.

“We’ve been leading into the 

third period three or four times 
this year, and we’ve blown it 
every time,” Kile said. “So we 
need to crack down defensively 
and make sure that doesn’t 
happen anymore.”

Michigan will now travel to 

the East Coast next weekend, 
where it will face Vermont and 
Dartmouth. But the Wolverines 
will start having to play better if 
they want to keep up their early-
season success.

“We have to get better,” 

Berenson said. “It’s not just 
because we’re young. We’re a 
different team than we were 
last year. I like the fact that our 
goalies are playing well. I like 
the fact that our young players 
are getting experience, but our 
team has to be better.”

Michigan relies on 
goaltending early

Saturday, the 11th-ranked 

Michigan hockey team was 
outshot, 
45-18. 
The 
night 

before, it was outshot, 34-27. 
In fact, the Wolverines have 
been outshot in every game this 
season.

And yet, they’ve only lost one 

of five games this year.

This 
weekend, 
Michigan 

(3-1-1) managed to scrounge 
up a tie against Michigan Tech 
after Saturday’s game despite 
holding 
the 
lead 
heading 

into the third 
period. 
The 

Wolverines 
were 
consistently 
outplayed and 
outshot, 
and 

they had barely 
scraped by the 
Huskies 
on 

Friday 
night 

for a 4-3 win. 
But their luck 
appeared to run out as they lost 
their lead in Saturday’s game, 
settling for a tie.

“I just feel we have to play 

better,” said Michigan coach 
Red Berenson. “I know it was 
a busy weekend and there was 
a lot going on, but nevertheless 
our team has to be a better 
team. I like the fact that our 
goalies are playing well. I like 
the fact that our young guys 
are getting experience, but our 
team has to be better.”

With 
a 
tendency 
to 
be 

outshot — and sometimes by a 
lot — Michigan’s goaltenders 
have had to keep the team 
afloat.

Freshman goaltender Jack 

LaFontaine was in front of the 
net during the second match 
up against Michigan Tech and 
racked up 42 saves. And after 
a 28-save game in his debut 
last weekend against Ferris 
State, where the Wolverines 

registered a 2-1 win over the 
Bulldogs, 
LaFontaine 
has 

proved he can be reliable in 
front of the net.

Friday 
night, 
freshman 

goaltender 
Hayden 
Lavigne 

showed that he was capable of 
a solid performance as well, 
recording his second win of the 
season and tallying 31 saves. 
His first win was a 29-shot save 
shutout against Union, and 
despite giving up three goals in 
Friday’s win, he continued to 
play well.

Even senior goaltender Zach 

Nagelvoort, who shouldered 

the team’s only 
loss (4-3 at the 
hands of Union) 
looked solid in 
front of the net. 
Regardless 
of 

the loss, he came 
away 
with 
36 

saves out of 40 
shots.

It’s clear that 

the goaltenders 
are capable of 

fending 
off 
large 
numbers 

of 
shots, 
but 
the 
27-shot 

deficit Michigan racked up 
on Saturday night still isn’t 
promising. 
Being 
outshot 

has become a trend for the 
Wolverines, and it’s one that 
the goaltenders are seeing a 
lot of. And while Michigan’s 
goaltenders 
have 
played 

well thus far, allowing the 
opposition to have 40 plus shots 
on goal usually isn’t a recipe for 
prolonged success.

And the Wolverines know 

that.

“There’s going to be games 

where a goalie will steal you the 
game,” Berenson said. “Maybe 
(LaFontaine) stole us a game 
at Ferris and so on, and maybe 
(Lavigne) stole us a game last 
night, when we were outshot, 
outplayed and out chanced. We 
have some talent in our locker 
room, but I don’t think we’re 
playing up to our talent yet.”

The good, the bad and the ugly: Michigan 41, Illinois 8

One week ahead of a perhaps 

slightly deflated visit to East 
Lansing, the Michigan football 
team kept rolling.

The Wolverines raced to a 41-8 

win over Illinois at Michigan 
Stadium on Saturday, keeping 
them undefeated heading into a 
rivalry game against Michigan 
State. 

The Daily broke down the 

good, the bad and the ugly from 
the game:

The good

Karan Higdon just keeps looking 

better. 
Michigan’s 
sophomore 

running back got off to a slow start 

this season after missing much 
of spring and summer workouts 
with mononucleosis and a knee 
injury. But after rushing nine 
times for 81 yards and two scores 
in Michigan’s 49-10 rout of Penn 
State last month, Higdon has 
continued to impress.

He 
did 
not 
play 
against 

Wisconsin, but he racked up 
108 yards and two touchdowns 
against Rutgers last week, and 
he gained 106 yards and a score 
against Illinois. In each of the last 
three games in which he played, 
Higdon has a run of at least 
40 yards. Against the Fighting 
Illini, he ripped off a 45-yard 
touchdown run in the fourth 
quarter that was the first real big 
play Michigan’s offense had made 
since the first half.

It should say something about 

Higdon that he got top billing 
in this section, especially since 
redshirt sophomore quarterback 
Wilton Speight had one of the 
best games of his career. Speight 
was 16-of-23 passing, totaling 253 
yards and two touchdowns.

Michigan’s 
defense 
lived 

up to its own deservedly lofty 
reputation, but we praise them all 
the time. This time, we thought 
a couple of offensive performers 
deserved some shine.

The bad

Outside of three big plays, 

Illinois had just 41 total yards of 
offense. Two 43-yard receptions 
and one 45-yard rush accounted 
for more than three quarters of 

the Fighting Illini’s offense, which 
is usually not a winning recipe. 
And while Illinois was the first 
team to bust a big play against the 
Wolverines since Penn State, its 
offense simply could not get into 
any kind of prolonged rhythm.

Much of this, of course, can be 

credited to the Michigan defense. 
But Illinois’ offense was not 
without fault.

Michigan held Jeff George Jr. 

without a completion in the first 
half, and while Jim Harbaugh 
said he thought George acquitted 
himself well, he certainly had to 
face some tough circumstances. 
Michigan now has the nation’s 
No. 4 rush defense to pair with its 
top-ranked pass ‘D,’ a pairing that 
allows the Wolverines plenty of 
options in coverage. George faced 

that pressure early, and it led him 
to a quarterback rating of -28.6 at 
the half.

There aren’t many tougher 

ways to make your college debut.

The ugly

Just as was the case in 

Michigan’s previous two home 
games, a Wolverine suffered a 
potentially serious injury. After 
Jeremy Clark (knee) and Grant 
Newsome (knee) were lost for 
the year against Penn State and 
Wisconsin, respectively, Michigan 
had another scare on Saturday.

Freshman 
running 
back 

Chris Evans took a jarring 
shot to the head on Michigan’s 
second drive and did not return. 
Harbaugh implied Evans briefly 

lost consciousness from the 
collision, though he could not 
specify after the game the 
severity of the injury.

Concussions are always serious, 

though, and with the emphasis 
being placed on them around 
the sports world, it would not be 
surprising if Evans had to miss 
extended time. The more glaring 
concern in this matter is his 
personal health, to be sure, but if 
Evans is lost for extended time, he 
will be the third key contributor 
the Wolverines have lost in 
their past four games. Redshirt 
junior fullback Khalid Hill and 
sophomore safety Tyree Kinnel 
also left Saturday’s game early.

That’s the opposite of what 

Michigan wants going into its 
critical final stretch.
