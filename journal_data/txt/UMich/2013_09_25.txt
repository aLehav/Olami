Despite allegations,
Keeney appointed
as general counsel
By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
Daily StaffReporter
Party politics took a toll on
the Central Student Govern-
ment agenda on Tuesday night as
assembly representatives made
accusations against Law stu-
dent Jeremy Keeney, who was
nominated to be student general
counsel, of being ethically com-
promised.
The University Election Com-
mission is a five-member body
responsible for settling election-
related disputes in CSG. A mem-
ber of the assembly is required to
serve on UEC each year. Keeney,
who served as an independent
assembly representative for the
2012-13 academic year, was nom-
inated for the position.

The assembly members voted
to appoint Keeney as SGC with
20 yes votes, six no votes and 12
abstentions.
During the last CSG election
cycle in late March, LSA senior
Chris Osborn - political party
forUM's presidential candidate
- was disqualified from the CSG
elections on grounds of election
code violations despite garner-
ing a plurality of the popular
vote. Candidates of opposition
party youMICH, Business senior
Michael Proppe was instated in
his place.
Rumors that Jeremy Keeney
had been promised a position
in the executive branch of CSG
in return for ousting forUM
through the UEC from the elec-
tion circulated, along with an
e-mail that allegedly proved Kee-
ney's prior affiliation with you-

Work focuses on
synapses, has
potential clinical
applications
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Daily StaffReporter
The human brain forms syn-
apses - microscopic connections
between neurons in the brain
- to record thoughts, memo-
ries and ideas. When 100-billion
neurons need to find their con-
nections, the biology behind the
process is complex, to say the
least.
Assistant Biochemistry Prof.
Hisashi Umemori said many
debilitating diseases, including
autism, epilepsy and schizo-
phrenia, could be linked to
certain neurodevelopmental
dysfunctions that occur when
brain structures fail to properly
mature.
Umemori's research was pub-
lished in the scientific journal,
Nature, on Sept. 15.
At the molecular level, these
dysfunctions are caused by
improper wiring of synapses.
Recently, Umemori's lab identi-
fied an important new molecule,

SIRP-alpha, which is involved in
the process of synapse matura-
tion in the brain, thus opening
the door to possible therapeutic
treatments.
"These diseases are caused
by defects during synapse for-
mation, so that's why under-
standing the steps of these
molecules - by which the brain
is formed - we hope to con-
tribute to the treatment and
prevention of those diseases,"
Umemori said.
The lab is exploring neuron
connectivity and brain develop-
ment, especially the pathways by
which the brain systems become
wired early in life.
"Neurons are precisely con-
nected to each other, mean-
ing each neuron knows exactly
wheretoconnect,"Umemorisaid.
"We're interested in how such a
precise network is formed."
Neuronal pathways in the
brain are formed in two distinct
steps, Umemori said. The first
step, which begins at birth and
continues until adolescence,
establishes the initial connec-
tions between neurons and forms
a preliminary network.
In the second step, the con-
nections are either reinforced or
eliminated based on the amount

shelves," Hamstra said.
There are no books that are
banned from the University,-but
the practice continues to be an
issue in some U.S. school dis-
tricts.
People stopped to listen as
they walked through the Diag
- Hamstra noted that in the
past people have been confused
as they walked past the read-
ing because censorship does not
seem to be a pressing issue on
campus.
"I think it's important that the
library has this advocacy this
week so that students are encour-
aged to be good patrons of their
libraries so they think critically
as they get involved in their com-
munities and school districts,"
she said.
Banned books have includ-
ed content against religious
values, magic with claims of
cultism, religious texts, offen-
sive language or anti-family
themes.
Hamstra said claims of
anti-family content usually
pertain to books that include
gay parents such as Lesla
Newman's "Heather has Two
Mommies."
In 2010, the Tucson Uni-
fied School District banned all
books by Chicano and Native
American authors, in response
to a state law that banned
schools from including mate-
rial in their instruction that
promote ethnic solidarity over
individuality. The TUSD deci-
sion to remove these books was
overturned this July by a fed-
eral court order.

the system of protecting chil-
dren, prompting administrators
and professors to examine how
minors are protected on cam-
pus.
Experts from different fields,
from medicine to risk manage-
ment, discussed the institutional
flaws. Bethany Mohr, medical
director of University of Michi-
gan Health System Child Protec-
tion Team, said UMHS faculty
and residents are not screened
for a history of committing child
abuse.
This screening, different from
a background check, would nar-
row in on instances that typically
do not warrant arrest and where
employees abuse their own chil-
dren. Though the Sandusky case
involved sexual abuse, Jenson
was not accused of having an
inappropriate contact with chil-
dren.
Mohr added that there are
issues with establishing poli-
cies on the provider-patient
relationship, which must com-
prehensively cover all possible
instances of abuse. She said
such policies should be better
known.
"Close to zero parents know
what to do," Mohr said about
cases where parents must grap-
ple with alleged abuse inci-

dents. "They just don't have any
resources."
The complexity of minors
interacting with University offi-
cials even extends to the Law
School. Frank Vandervort, super-
vising attorney at the University

LSA freshman Jessica Longe
was a junior at Salem High
School, 25 miles outside of Ann
Arbor, when the superintendent
decided to ban "Waterland" from
her AP English class after a com-
plaint from one of the student's
parents due to sexually graphic
descriptions.
After months of debate at
school board meetings, a panel of
community members decided to
revoke the ban.
Longe - who read a pas-
sage aloud at the event - said
the debate brought religion and
politics into the school system,
which she didn't think was
appropriate.
She was frustrated that the
school system was trying to
appease specific children rather
than creating curricula that
works for the entire student
body.
Just last week, the school
board in Ralph County, N.C.
banned the book "Invisible Man"
claiming it was innapropriate for
teenagers and that it did not hold
any literary value. Visiting Pof.

excerpt from "In'visible Man at

The Banned Books Week

States. Advocates can also

ning to the ALA.
On Thursday, Sept. 26, stu-
dents can contribute to a Vir-
tual Read Out video statement
celebrating the freedom to read
by reading out a few lines from a
banned book. Anyone interested
should go to the Practice Pre-
sentation Room in the Under-
graduate Library from 1 p.m. to

Juvenile Justice Clinic, said his
students represent minors in
criminal courts.
However, the Law School
doesn't have policies on how
to appropriately treat children.
Vandervort recently asked his
colleagues where he could find
such policies.
"Most of the people looked at
me with a very strange face like
I was from outer space," he said.
Lawyers and clergy mem-
bers are not required to report
witnessed sexual abuse even
in states where all adults are
required to, a precedent that
angered Vandervort.
"It seems to me in that circum-
stance the response is so obvi-
ous is that we shouldn't have a
national debate or conversation
about these sort of things," he
said.
Faller said she hoped the
seminar translates to better
policy at the University. Her fel-
low speakers said other colleges'
policies lack comprehensiveness,
though some campuses are more
advanced.
"We're hoping that out of
this will come more coherent
understanding, but also a better
policy and better ideas of policy
when kids are on campus," she
said.
Some graduate students may
attend the seminars for credit.
Social Work graduate student
Christian Moore was one such

student in a crowd of professors
- he hopes to work in University
outreach.
"I wish that more, students,
were aware of the course," he
said. "It promotes agreater dia-
logue about safety."

CSG
From Page 1A
youMICH presidential nominee, sent
an e-mail to assembly representatives
and youMICH affiliates, recommend-
ing candidates for select executive and
legislative positions, including that
Keeney was qualified to be instated as
the rules committee chair. At the time,
Keeney was a representative on the
assembly, popularly elected as an inde-
pendent.
At the time, youMICH party members
served as the majority in the assembly,
giving them the majority vote to select
and confirm candidates for committee-
chair positions.
Keeney denied all allegations of affili-
ations with youMICH prior to the UEC
hearings.
While the youMICH e-mail sug-
gests that Keeney was affiliated with
youMICH, Proppe said the decision to
instate Keeney as chair of the commit-
tee was solely due to the fact that Keeney
was the most qualified candidate for the
position.
While Keeney previously served as a
lawyer for the youMICH team during
the legal proceedings that followed the
2012 CSG election, he was appointed
externally by the Central Student Judi-
ciary to serve youMICH - along with
now-defunct party ourMichigan - and
was paid for his services.
As a result, when Proppe announced,
his nomination of Keeney for a position
on his executive branch, the Executive
Nominations Committee conducted an
investigation on the alleged affiliations
that may compromise Keeney's impar-
tiality.
Architecture senior John Arnold,
chair of the Executive Nominations
Committee, said although Keeney was a
qualified candidate for the position and
he recognized that a lot of the allega-
tions were "hearsay," the committee felt

that Keeney was ethically compromised.
"We feel that because of (Keeney's)
prior involvement with youMICH, it
would have been good ethical prac-
tice for him to recuse himself from the
(UEC)hearings,"Arnold said. "Confirm-
ing a candidate that has been intimately
involved with the past two (election tri-
als), we don't think is a good way to ame-
liorate the issues."
In an August interview, former stu-
dent general counsel Lukas Garske, an
ex-officio and non-voting member of the
last UEC, said he made all UEC members
disclose their party affiliations prior the
hearing and that the decision to oust the
forUM candidates was a "very clear-cut
decision."
In a written statement, Garske said
there was no proof confirming rumors
that Keeney had "accepted a deal" from
youMICH that promised he would be
appointed as SGC if the UEC disquali-
fied Osborn from the presidency.
"It would be a shame if (Keeney) was
denied the ability to continue to serve
CSG because of party politics," Garske
wrote.
Proppe stressed that he never prom-
ised Keeney the SGC position before the
hearings had finished. In contemplating
possible candidates, Propre said the first
time he reached dout to Keeney for the
position was in late April, after all elec-
tion disputes had been resolved.
Lawstudent Betsy Fisher, who served
as forUM's lawyer during the election
cycle, issued a statement that said that
the issues raised were "structural rather
than ethical" as Keeney's presence on
the UEC panel was his responsibility as
an assembly member, regardless of affili-
ation.
"I worked hard on forUM's case,
and I'm disappointed that anyone from
forUM would attack the credibility of
their colleagues six months after the
election dispute was finalized," she
added. "I'm embarrassed to be associ-
ated with anyone who would."

BRAIN
From Page 1A,
of activity they encounter, estab-
lishing a "functional circuitry,"
Umemori said.
"In the beginning, we usu-
ally have excess synapses, so
we choose good ones," he said.
"Active ones will be stabilized
and inactive ones will be elimi-
nated, so that we will basically
have the most efficient circuitry
in the brain."
While the lab's research
involves development of the brain
over time, the recent findings
focus on the molecular mecha-
nisms that underlie the process of
synapse maturation in the second
step of the process.
In particular, Umemori's lab
has confirmed the role a new
molecule in this step: signal regu-
latory protein-alpha. SIRP-alpha
travels between pre- and post-
synaptic neurons, binding with
specific receptors that tell the
neuron to reinforce the synaptic
connection.
"SIRP is basically used as a
communication tool between
pre- and post-synaptic cells to tell
them that this is an active syn-

apse," Umemori said.
The molecule was discovered
in2010 in a research study focus-
ing primarily on the first step of
neuron development. It wasn't
until the lab's most recent pub-
lication that they realized the
importance of this molecule in
synaptic reinforcement was real-
ized.
Irl the search for molecules
involved in the synapse matu-
ration process, Umemori's lab
screened brain tissue samples in
culture - placing neurons in con-
tact with a variety of molecules
thought to play a role in synapse
development.
After identifying cultures
with active synapse formation,
the tissue samples underwent a
procedure known as biochemi-
cal purification, which separates
molecules based on different
characteristics such as size or
charge.
In future studies, Umemori
said the lab hopes to analyze the
effects of synapse dysfunction
in schizophrenia using geneti-
cally modified mice, often called
knockouts. While these mice are
thought to express schizophre-
nia, the lab plans to run behhvior-
al studies to confirn'the presence

of this trait - or "phenotype" -
and its link to synaptic develop-
ment.
"We have the knockout ani-
mals, and knockout animals do
have synaptic changes, but we
don't know if they have different
phenotype yet," Umemori said.
"If the animals show schizo-
phrenic phenotype then we can
try to treat (them) and see if that
can be a disease model."
Additionally, future research
in the lab will examine other
areas of the brain, since the
recent findings were isolated to
specific regions like the hippo-
campus.
Erin Johnson-Venkatesh, a
postdoctoral research fellow
in the lab, plans to expand the
research to cover other aspects of
synapse development.
"The paper focuses only on
excitatory synapses," Johnson-
Venkatesh said. "Inhibitory syn-
apses also may be affected, so
I'm trying to figure out why and
how."
Although the research has
potentially broad implications for
clinical treatments of neurode-
velopmental diseases, Johnson-
Venkatesh said the molecular
professes tend to dominate the

day-to-day focus of the lab. Only
when a project reaches the pub-
lication stage does she come to
fully realize the impact of such
work.
"You get really engrossed in a
particular set of experience and
sometimes you forget to even
come up for air and all of a sud-
den ... we need to write a paper
and share these results," she said.
"Usually atthe beginning and the
end you sort of think more larger
picture, and in the middle you're
just focused."
Two University alumni, Anna
Toth and Lily Zhang, both con-
tributed to this recent publi-
cation. Given their success in
this field, Johnson-Venkatesh
offered advice to undergradu-
ates interested in pursuing
research.
"I think finding something
you're interested in is probably
the most important," she said.
"And the second most important
is finding an environment that
you like working in ... because
then you're going to enjoy being
there."

Dettlinger contributed reporting.

ment during the 1970s and
1980s, including the conserva-
tive women who fervently fought
against the Equal Rights Amend-
ment, which was never ratified.
The episode was taped during a
lecture the 2013 winter semes-
ter in Morantz-Sanchez's course,
"Women in American History
Since 1870."
When Morantz-Sanchez
earned a Ph.D. at Columbia
3 University in 1971, classes like
"Women in American History"
would never have appeared on
the pages of a university course
.guide.
"When I went to graduate
school, I learned nothing really,
except the abilityto tell good his-
tory from bad history because
., E none of the history we practice

today really existed," Morantz-
Sanchez said.
At the time,she said mosthistory
classes were aboiut'mple history.'^
"We never spoke about
women," Morantz-Sanchez said.
History as studied at iniver-
sities and taught in classrooms,
she said, was told through a nar-
row lens. The subject generally
ignored the complexities of race,
class and gender - it generally
focused on a political narrative
absent of cultural influences.
Morantz-Sanchez left Colum-
bia later that year. At that time,
interest in the Civil Rights Move-
ment was growing at universities.
Morantz-Sanchez considered
trekking down South to register
disenfranchised voters'.
"Growing up in th Aextraordy
nary 12 years of social and politi-
cal change in the '60s and '70s,
I think many of us were open to
thinking outside the box," she

said. "And one of the first things
the Civil Rights Movement did
was to touch other people living
in American society."
In essence, the period's politi-
cal tumult influenced Morantz-
Sanchez and her contemporaries
to broaden the lens through
which academics and students
write about and study history.
"All of these things were not
necessarily taught as what was
'real history,' " she said. "What
it does is help us much better
understand ourselves - once we'
understand the complex ways we
are created as Americans, as gen-
dered people, as classed people,
as raced people, and all those
different categories are working
together mutually construct the
cultural world in which we live."
Despite these disciplinary
advances, Morantz-Sanchez said
enrollment in many of her history
courses has decreased over the

past 10 years.
"I think we're a society that
doesn't believe in history any-
more," she said.
On Saturday, a program dedi-
cated to "the people and events
that document the American
story," will air the lecture of a
professor hoping to do just that in
her Ann Arbor classroom.
But Morantz-Sanchez, who
was recruited by C-SPAN for
inclusion in the program, doesn't
have any delusions about the net-
work's demographic reach.
"Do I think anybody will
watch this C-SPAN thing? His-
tory buffs, maybe," she said.
Morantz-Sanchez isn't dis-
counting the power of history,
though. She's seen its enduring
weight when classes end each
term and a student says: "Boy I
really didn't want to take this, but
I really do understand myself bet-
ter now."

Michigan's defense of ban on adoption by same sex couples is baseless
In October, Jayne Rowse and April DeBoer, a gay couple who have
three adopted children, will challenge Michigan's ban on same-sex
joint adoption before the U.S. District Court in Detroit. Basing their
case on the precedents established by United States v. Windsor, which
found the Federal Defense of Marriage Act's restriction of the definition of
marriage to "one man, one woman" unconstitutional, Rowse and DeBoer
hope to convince the court that Michigan's ban on adoption by homosex-
ual couples is in violation of the right to due process. With the gay-rights
movement gaining momentum across Michigan and the rest of the United
States, overturning the ban is a logical decision for the state's future.

n August, the esteemed Ameri-
can novelist, activist and Pulit-
zer Prize winner Alice Walker
was disinvited
from giving the
keynote address
for the Univer-
sity's Center for
the Education
of Women's
50th anniver-
sary event in ZEINAB
March. On herZ
blog, Walker KHALIL
expressed her
disappointment
in the University's decision. Just
a few days later, this news made
national headlines, and the Univer-
sity wasn't looking too hot for disin-
viting a world-renowned writer and
peace activist committed to trans-
formative change.
The University then announced a
few weeks later that it had extended
a different invitation to Walker, this
time for the Zora Neale Hurston Lec-
ture co-hosted by the CEW and the
Department of Afroamerican and
African Studies next fall. Walker has
accepted the new invitation and will
speak on campus in November 2014.
while I'm thrilled that Walker
will come to campus - though it's a
bummer that I will have graduated
by then - the "ending" to this highly
embarrassing and murky situation is
far from peachy. Walker's reinvita-
tion doesn't excuse the University
from answering some serious ques-
tions that have come to light through
this incident.
What symbolic message does the
University send when it appears to
silence and monitor a prominent
Black, female activist? What does
this incident tell us about the voices
of figures who hold critical, counter-
hegemonic perspectives - in this
case about Palestine and Israel? And
finally, what does the case say about
donor transparency and accountabil-
ity at the University?
Too often, Black women are
policed for how they behave and
what they say. This marginalizing is
perhaps even more severe for women
activists who promote alternative
models of framing and understand-
ing of social and political issues.
The revoking of Walker's initial
invite must be read against the back-

drop of a campus that has a lot of
work to do in fostering an inclusive
college climate: underrepresented
minority enrollment - including
Blacks, Hispanics and Native Ameri-
cans - is worse now than it was 10
years ago, falling from 13.6 percent in
2002 to 10.2 percent in 2012. Just as
troublingis the 6.6-percentrepresen-
tation of women of color from under-
represented groups in 2011 and the
7-percent representation of women
of color faculty in 2008 - only 3
percent for full professors. Campus
climate certainly goes beyond statis-
tics, but these numbers nevertheless
point to something telling and dis-
tressing that can't be detached from
campus happenings such as this one.
Walker's racial liberation activ-
ism stretches back to the Civil
Rights Movement, where she mobi-
lized Black voters in the south dur-
ing the 1960s and demonstrated
alongside Dr. Martin Luther King
in the 1963
March on
Washington. How can w
She continues
her activism such decisi
through more don't know
recent events:
in March the decisior
2003, on
International
Women's Day, just 11 days before
the United States dropped its first
bombs on Iraq, Walker was arrest-
ed in front of the White House with
a number of other anti-war woman
activists. Walker demonstrated
because she believed the lives of
Iraqi women and children to be just
as precious as American lives, but
the petty charges waged against
her made clear that her anti-racist,
anti-imperialist message posed a
threat to the mainstream warmon-
gering narrative.
But perhaps even more unsettling
to the status quo - and her stated
reason for being disinvited from the
University in the first place - are
Walker's views on the Israeli gov-
ernment's military occupation of
Palestine. Walker joined the Free-
dom Flotilla in 2011 to challenge
the Israeli blockade of Gaza, and
prior to that, in 2009, she travelled
to Gaza with the anti-war feminist
organization, Code Pink, in wake of
Operation Cast Lead, a three-week

assault launched by Israeli military
forces that resulted in the deaths of
1,416 Palestinians and 13 Israelis. Ina
show of extremely disproportionate
force, Israeli-armed forces repeat-
edly violated international law and
exercised collective punishment
by dropping white phosphorous on
densely-populated communities. On
her trip, Walker spoke out against
this assault and implored Israel and
Egypt to open their borders and end
the ongoing siege of Gaza, a territory
roughly the size of Detroit inhabited
by nearly two million people.
Most pressingly, the Walker case
begs a question of transparency:
Who's calling the shots? While the
University insists that Walker's dis-
invitation had nothing to do with
her political positions or the con-
tent of her speech, her agent noted
that the disinvitation happened at
the request of an unnamed donor's
"interpretation" of her "comments
regarding Israel"
How can we
e challenge challenge such
decisions - or
ions if we similar future

their actors

don't know who
affects the deci-
sion-making? It's unfair and shallow
to point to'those who are the face of
the University --that is, CEW and its
administration, as bearing the brunt
of responsibility in answering these
questions. Rather, those who play a
more behind-the-scenes role in the
decision-making must also respond.
Obviously, donors to the Univer-
sity are crucial for the role they play
in sustaining campus life. But where
is that role ever clearly defined? At
what point do the perspectives of
alumni and donors - many of whom
are no longer on campus and may
not realize the changing climate
- encroach on what voices are wel-
comed on campus and what views
students are exposed to? The Uni-
versity community must openly and
urgently confront issues of academic
integrity and financial pressure to
ensure that such insidious behavior
has no place on our campus.

Attorneys representing Michigan, led by
Republican Attorney General Bill Schuette,
are disputing Rowse and DeBoer's motion to
challenge the law in court. However, their
argument can only be described as inap-
propriate. In a brief filed earlier this month,
Schuette claimed that Michigan has a legiti-
mate interest in restricting child adoption
to heterosexual couples in order to encour-
age "the unique procreative capacity of such
relationships." He goes on to say, "...social
scientists have consistently recognized the
essential connection between marriage and
responsible procreation and childrearing."
Essentially, the state must exclusively sponsor
opposite-sex marriages to promote popula-
tion growth. This explanation is preposterous
and doesn't represent the state of Michigan.
Practically speaking, fighting this case
continues the growing waste of the state's
resources and keeps vulnerable children
from families. Most times, there are about
3,000 foster children in Michigan in need of

a home. Continuing to fund these kids when
there are families willing to care for them is
careless spending and simply cold-hearted.
Snyder should not allow his personal or his
administration's beliefs interfere with letting
a child live in a positive environment. Baseless
claims, like this one, are the cause of pointless
arguing within Michigan's government that
takes upa great deal of time.
According to the Michigan Department
of Human Resources, "Michigan has been
recognized as a leader for our innovative
approach to adoption and our high adoptive
placement rates." However, allowing this pol-
icy to continue is the contrary. Withdrawing
Michigan's legal defense of the ban on same-
sex joint child adoption and instituting a fair
procedure to allow these adoptions to occur
needs to be the state's course of action. Like-
wise, Schuette and his associates should be
publicly censured for their abuse of science in
the brief challenging the motion from Rowse
and DeBoer.

On Sept. 20, an event called PARK(ing)
Day came to Ann Arbor for the first time in
three years. In promotion of a pedestrian-
centered city, two University graduate stu-
dents - Rackham student Jenny Cooper and
Rackham and Public Health student Arielle
Fleisher - took over a parking spot on State
Street and converted it into a mini-park - a
place for relaxing, lunching and socializing,
open to any Ann Arbor resident who hap-
pened to be walking by between 11:30 a.m.
and 5:00 p.m.
A public place of this sort seems almost
necessary for a well-planned city, but if you
think about it, downtown Ann Arbor seems
to be lacking these open-space environments.
There are currently four designated "city
parks" downtown, but there are problems.
First is Liberty Plaza - great for Sonic Lunch,
but otherwise a popular gathering place for the
homeless. Next is the Kempf House Museum,
which is a museum, not a park. Sculpture Plaza
is a charming brick area surrounded by restau-
rants. And lastly, the Farmers Market is a pavil-
ion-covered area usually inhabited by people
only during the brief times when it is open.
While all these places are beneficial in their
own ways to the character of downtown, they
aren't exactly the image that comes to mind
when most people hear the words "city park."
Ann Arbor residents want to be able to spend
time downtown without being in a store, at
a restaurant or walking through areas that
seem to be more automobile-friendly than
person-friendly.
PARK(ing) Day makes a much-needed
statement for the necessity of more green
spaces and open areas downtown and brings
forth the unfortunate truth that Ann Arbor,
like the majority of cities, is made for cars.
While cars provide the "easiest" mode of
transportation for most people - especially
families - they aren't the most city-friendly, and
they are definitely not the most environmental-
ly friendly. People often get out of the suburbs

and head downtown for a car-free experience
that you can't find elsewhere, but many down-
town experiences have come to mirror those in
the suburbs: driving, parking, buying and then
going back home to the "burbs."
From an urban planning standpoint, there
are many things that could be addressed to fix
the city's car-plagued atmosphere. Ease for
walkers and bikers seem to be at the foreground
of these potential solutions, with proposals for
more defined bike lanes and more bike parking
in and out of parking garages.
Most often, citizens complain that they
can't find locations downtown where they
can spend more than a few minutes without
being expected to make a purchase. Hanging
out at Starbucks is great, but not without first
purchasing an overpriced beverage.
One main problem here is that it's most
cost-beneficial for the city to dedicate space
to businesses that will pay to use it. Naturally,
less profit is being made if the area is desig-
nated for the recreation that doesn't involve
spending money.
Part of the solution to this problem comes
from the way that public areas are set up. If
they're open to events that will end up making
the city money, they become more economi-
cally practical in the eyes of officials, as well as
more welcoming in the eyes of the community.
Another more significant part of the solu-
tion is in the community mindset. This is
what PARK(ing) Day is trying to get across -
the point that urban spaces weren't created to
be made up of cars and concrete, but to foster
a walkable, bikeable environment that allows
a city of students and workers to clear their
heads during every bit of the short hours
they're able to spend outdoors.
Ann Arbor might not have the capacity for
a Central Park, but the interspersingof urban
and green environments is the ideal equiva-
lent for a pedestrian's peace of mind.

TO THE DAILY:
I'm not entirely opposed to the
idea that fans have to "claim" their

the non-student demand for tickets,
then give all 4,500 students their

two or three weeks prior to basket-

selves. Did they think that students

Last year, I purchased Michigan

great break from my studies as a

to purchase season tickets again this

But I confess - I didn't make it to
every game last season. I was there
for the big games. But I missed a
few, mostly in the non-conference
season. I missed games because
I had to focus on school. After all,
I'm a student. Given the amount of
tuition I pay to the University of

Don't worry if you forgot about
Kings of Leon - most of us did. So,
with the release of the band's sixth
studio album, Mechanical Bull, on
Sept. 24, a quick

family - the
literal sons RCA
and nephew
of a preacher man - spent much
of the early 2000s as garage
rock's southern darlings before
achieving colossal commercial
success on their stadium-friendly
fourth album, Only By Night. After
two years as unprecedented rock
gods, they released the mediocre
Come Around Sundown, which
maintained neither the rebellious
charm of their early work, nor the
anthemic hits of their previous
album. While on tour supporting
the album, amid rumors of
alcoholism and infighting, lead
singer Caleb Followhill famously
left the stage to "vomit and drink
a beer." He didn't return, the band
cancelled the rest of the tour and
more or less vanished for three
years.
Now, the Nashville boys are
back and ready to reclaim their

will host an Thursday,

The show is one portion of a

Professor Joseph Lam,

the University.
Lam pointed out that the
Confucius Institute has
offered many events, like
lectures, exhibitions, painting,

yet to do anything related to
fashion.
"I had the idea of doing a

we were visiting The Central

the director of The Academy,
and I told him I wanted to do

Lewan: 'I'm not going to apologize for being 4-0'

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
When fans watched the Mich-
igan football team scrape by
Connecticut on Saturday, it was
almost like a horrible sense of
deji vu. The Wolverines didn't
see it that way, though.
After beating the Huskies,
Michigan sauntered off the
field, patting each other on the
back and smiling. The mood
was jovial. You wouldn't have
been able to tell the Wolverines
just survived another close call,
another narrow win against a
team they were supposed to have
run circles around.
It was a far cry from the Akron
game a week prior. After that
disappointment, Michigan didn't
celebrate its win. It walked off
the field in silence. Fifth-year
senior left tackle Taylor Lewan
cursed during his postgame

interview, while redshirt junior
quarterback Devin Gardner sat
by his side in silence.
Fans may not have been able
to tell the difference between the
team that played the Zips and
the one that faced the Huskies,
but Michigan coach Brady Hoke
certainly could.
"It was a much different
team," he said when asked if he
saw an improvement in the Wol-
verines from Akron to UConn.
Lewan agrees. The captain
used the word embarrassing five
times to describe Michigan's
performance against Akron.
Tuesday, though, he was more
optimistic about the Wolverines'
future as they head into their
first bye week on the eve of Big
Ten play.
"I'm not going to apologize for
being 4-0," Lewan said. "I saw a
huge sense of urgency in those
young guys. They understand we

want to be successful every sin-
gle week. I think it really clicked
for them in the second half of the
game."
But for as much as the pro-
gram says it's improved over the
last week, there's one main area
of concern - the coaching staff
is still looking for a way to reign
in Gardner's unpredictable play
that manifested Saturday with
his eighth interception of the
season.
Last week, offensive coordina-
tor AlBorges said Gardner wasn't
generally the type of player to
make the same mistake twice.
Hoke contradicted that state-
ment on Tuesday, though, saying
that Gardner now has to be "re-
coached," since he's become such
a wild card on the field.
The issue of Gardner as a
Superman figure has also been
addressed this season - does
Gardner try and do everything
himself because he simply
doesn't have enough trust in the
rest of his teammates? Hoke says
no.
"I think he's been a Superman
a long time," Hoke said. "I think
when you grow up being Super-
man, you have that in your mind,
and he's competitive. It's in his
DNA."
Lewan has been Gardner's
staunchest supporter, putting
much of the quarterback's woes
on his shoulders after the Akron
game.
As he reminded Gardner's
critics, there are still 10 other
players on the field, and a missed
assignment from any one of them
can be responsible for Gardner's
unpredictability.
"We haven't played a perfect
game yet," Lewan said. "Our
job is to perform like a Michi-
gan team every year. You look
around, there are banners every-
where of successful Michigan
teams. That's what we need to
live up to."

TERRA MOLENGRAFF/
Redshirt junior quarterback Devin Gardner has struggled to balance making plays and trying to be "Superman."
NOTABLE QUOTABLE
I think the media takes opponents and
downplays them. You know, I feel they did

phy that dinged off the crossbar.
In overtime, Michigan kept its
momentum, getting a shot on goal
in the first minute.
Oakland responded with two
quick shots and redshirt junior
goalkeeper Adam Grinwis saved
both in extraordinary fashion.
This was Grinwis's first shutout of
the season, and he finished with 10
saves, his season high.
Passions and tempers started to
run high as the referees continued
to make few calls that Michigan
agreed with. Daley was almost
ejected and two separate fore-
heads-pressed-together moments
between players occurred in the
first half of overtime.
"We are disappointed that we
weren't protected enough by the
referee but those things happen
and we dealt with it and moved
on," Daley said.
In the last 10 seconds of the first
overtime session, senior forward
Malcolm Miller broke away, pull-
ing the Oakland keeper to the top
of the 18-yard box, resulting in a
collision that gave Miller a con-

troversial yellow card. It was the
third of four for the night, two to
the Grizzlies and the fourth to
freshman defenseman Lars Eck-
enrode.
In the second overtime, Oak-
land outshot Michigan 5-4, but
Grinwis kept the shutout intact by
forcing a bouncing ball wide of the
goal post.
The frustrations and stressors
continued for Michigan up until
the final seconds, as the game
clock was stopped for an Oakland
corner with 14 seconds remaining
in overtime.
The game remained tied,
though, leaving Michigan to con-
tinue its struggles on the road. The
Wolverines lost six road games
last season, and won just two. In
2013, they are now 1-1-2 on the
road. But according to Daley, their
biggest improvements could still
come in the offensive half where
he said they need to score goals.
"There were five or six really
quality chances, but we need to
connect them on target," Daley
said. "We got to make the keeper
make a save or put in the back of
the net and we didn't do either."

Michigan fired 17
shots, but offensive
crisis builds
By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Editor
OAKLAND, Mich. - In a 0-0
overtime draw against Oakland
on Tuesday, the Michigan men's
soccer team struggled to garner
many quality chances, despite
firing 17 shots. Quality over
quantity is what Michigan coach
Chaka Daley urged his squad to
focus on offensively, but Michi-
gan could muster just six strikes
on goal.
Nothing epitomized the Wol-
verines' struggles more than
when the Grizzlies' goalkeeper,
Sean Lewis, made his first save
in the 59th minute of the match.
After that, he coasted to a relax-
ing evening.
"There's only one save I think
I remember him making that
I think he had to make," Daley
said.
There aren't issues with the
attacking build-up or the posses-
sion battle, though. Both of those
went according to plan for the
majority of the match.
Specifically in the overtime
sessions, Michigan controlled
the ball in the final third as it
toyed with Oakland's back line.
The Wolverines continued to
string creative passes together
but could never break through.
Shots from sophomore mid-
fielder Colin McAtee and senior
forward Tyler Arnone barely
crept wide, while others sailed
over the crossbar at crucial
moments. In the final 90 sec-
onds, sophomore forward James
Murphy's header bounced off the
crossbar before it was cleared
to ensure extra time. The list of
missed opportunities goes on
and on. The Wolverines were
close, but putting 31 percent of
their shots on goal is far from
desirable.

"I know them all," Daley said.
"I remember every single one of
the missed chances in the 18, in
and around the box, that were
better than what you'd call half
chances, and we didn't take
them."
Michigan was often passive
while peppering the Grizzlies'
defense, which hindered the
chance for quality opportuni-
ties that Daley was looking for.
Rightly so, frustration began
setting in after regulation, as yel-
low cards were shown to Mur-
phy and freshman defender Lars
Eckenrode for retaliations in the
offensive third.
"I thought we tried to be a lit-
tle bit too precise at times in the
final third, as opposed to kind of
being a little more aggressive and
assertive," Daley said.
Similar offensive setbacks
have plagued the Wolverines all
season. Michigan has been shut
out three times already this sea-
son with four goals in the past
six games. A 5-2 thrashing of
Loyola-Chicago in the season
opener fooled everybody.
A 228-minute scoring drought
before netting two goals at West
Virginia this past weekend was
the most recent episode of the
Wolverines' offensive shortcom-
ings.
The woes are slowly turn-
ing into something resembling
a crisis for Michigan. With Big
Ten season looming this week-
end, the Wolverines are urgently
searching for answers.

THE t t -that glass case of cured meats and
bagels, my palms are sweating, I
rcan't breath, my heart is racing, and,
oh my god, why are there so many
Haley Goldberg Teresa Mathew Matthew Slovin people in this tiny room? The act of
choosing a Zingerman's sandwich
- a.k.a. the finely curated piece of

art that will grace my palette with
its sweet succulence in a matter of
minutes - is almost too much.
But then I stop. And I breathe.
And I think, "What would Ari and
Paul eat?" And suddenly, everything
goes black. Like a prophecy flowing
down from heaven above, it comes
to me: something savory but not too
heavy, with a touch of something
crunchy and a little bit tangy, some-
thing creamy and rich, but light
enough that it sails off the tongue
and into your stomach like a beauti-
ful crescendo at the end of a sym-
phony. A simple white bread with
just a hint of something - maybe
rye? And of course, a light browning
on both sides.
But over the years, I've learned
it's not just about the food. I mean,
it is, and it isn't. Get between my
server and me when they call my
name and it will be one of the
most regretful decisions you've
ever made. There is no amount of
heartbreak or failing grades that a
big ol' bowl of your steaming hot
matzo ball soup can't fix. And let's
be honest - you can bring more
people to a party with Zingerman's
old pickles than you can with a full
keg of light beer and red solo cups.
We all know that the food is superb.
But this isn't what I'm here to talk
about.
I'm here to talk about the witty
sandwich names, the exotic samples
(pickled mozzarella and jalapefio
peaches anyone?), the drool-worthy
cheeses and snacks on snacks. I'm
here to talk about how you blow
me away with your wall of choco-

G
late, and your Bacon of the Month
club. It's like you're taking me by
the hand and saying, "I don't care
who you are or where you're from
- there is something here that you
will love." And that feels awesome.
And the people! How could I
forget the people? Each and every
time I walk through those doors -
no, come within a two-block radius
- there's someone on the corner of
Detroit and Kingsley hooting and
hollering about the latest special,
their thoughts on the olive oil I'm
sampling, and the crazy thing some-
one said to them that day. Someone
is blowing my mind with the pros-
pect of putting peanut butter on
the chocolate sourdough. Someone
is making me laugh so hard with
a joke about the soup they spilled
on their apron that I start crying.
These in between moments of
potential-best-friendness are what
keep me waiting over an hour in
seven-degree weather for a God
damn sandwich. They make me
proud to say we've shared this city,
even if only for a little while.
I'm here to tell you, Ari and Paul,
that I want to grow old with you
and your culinary masterpieces.
You've made me a better person.
You've made me want - no, deserve
- the creme de la creme, the Grade
A and the Amish chicken. You stand
for all that is right in this culinary
world, and, for that, I salute you.

had time to make a choice. Did my friend
mean she physically wasn't able to swerve,
or that she wouldn't because it would have
been too dangerous?
That day was like any normal, bright
morning. There was no fog, no roadblocks
and no curving streets. I had not paused
when the bird changed directions. I merely
hit the thing and left.
This same summer, I interned at an
endangered-species nonprofit in Wash-
ington, D.C. I spent over three months
studying policy initiatives that would bet-
ter protect endangered species in North
America. I read news reports of hunters in
Colorado who shot and killed a gray wolf
cub after its federal protections had been
cut.
I also had learned how to protect back-
yard birds that fly into the shiny windows
that create the illusion of tree branches.
In one meeting I attended, one employee
explained how to put up window decals
so that the bird can discern the difference
between the window and the trees. After-
wards, another employee mentioned how
birds die from hitting the window, not so
much because of the impact, but because
of the stress from not being able to under-
stand where the pain came from. The
man noted that you could save the bird by
cupping it in your palms or placing it in a
small box. The warmth supposedly calms it

My days interning were filled with unex-
pected pockets of interesting information.
I grew to have much admiration for the
animal life around. I even purchased a D.C.
bird book so that I might be able to identify
some of the species wandering outside my
office.
But just a few weeks later, the same
mindful driver, the vegetarian and wild-
life advocate, ran over a bird without a
moment's hesitation. It was almost too
easy.
The event left me with a crisis of con-
science. I kept replaying the incident in my
head. Why didn't I swerve? How could I
just run the poor, helpless animal over and
keep going? I heard the soft 'thump thump'
over and over.
Things like this happen all the time.
They are in your control to stop, but you
don't always stop because of the way we
think and the nature of our daily routines. I
expected I would not hit the bird. I expect-
ed it would fly away.

en" have nearly doubled over the four
years. There's been a 62-percent increase
in athletic-administrator compensation,
and "professional travel and conference
dues" tripled from 2010-11. Even the line
item "hosting, food and special events"
4as increased six-fold.
To fund these expenses, ticket prices
go up, all sorts of new apparel are sold
and season ticket holders pay for a per-
sonal seat license.
As former University President James_
Duderstadt says in the book, he's alarmed -
"how little of these revenues are actually
spent on student-athletes - for financials
aid, academic support and health care - -
and instead are spent on the expansion
of facilities and the staff, in areas such
as marketing. ... In the revenue sports,
these are approaching levels that are
b"Trily extreme and quite unwarranted
when compared with other university
activities."
He also accuses Brandon of using his
platform to gain personal glory.
"Brandon comes out of a CEO world
- and even a million-dollar salary is
chump change for those guys. So it has to
be a personal payoff to be out in front of
a crowd of one hundred thousand, cheer- :
ing for you. You don't get that as CEO."
It may be that Brandon is simply
powerless to the commercial direction
%fcollege sports. The ship has already
departed the dock, and he's not going "'""w mm
to be the one responsible for Michigan T " 4a x
being left on shore.,
After multiple c-mails and phone calls 4
requesting an interview, the Athletic 4
Department declined to make Brandon
or any other department member avail- .
able for comment. e ""
"The money end of it and the demandsr
of the kids now, that bothers me," Eaton,W
the former Michigan defensive end, said.
"But we're competing out there, and it's
not Michigan's place to try and save col-'
lege athletics. It's the presidents of the
universities of the country to help con- 6
trol that. Personally, I think it's gotten
out of hand."
There's little reason for Brandon to#
change his style unless university presi-
dents do indeed step in. The Michigan
Athletic Department is making money,
and when it's not, it's being given money,
like $100 million from Stephen Ross.,.
Its teams are successful. Last year,
the Wolverines came in fourth in the
, untry in the Director's Cup, a measure
of success across all sports. It was the
school's highest finish in five years. l
And even despite Michigan's place inv
the decrepit state of Big Ten football, the
Wolverines couldn't be more relevant in
today's college sports landscape. And Dave o
Bandon is making sure of that.
So until there's reason not to, there willw
be fireworks. Always the fireworks.'

In February 2006, Domino's Pizza CEO
Dave Brandon thought, "Wouldn't it
be cool if we could rent out Ford Field
the week of the Super Bowl?" So he did. He
threw a company party at the Lions' stadium
days before Super Bowl XL came to Detroit.
The company would celebrate each time
Domino's stock hit a new high, and one time
he ordered kegs of beer and brought them
into the office.
Years prior - when Brandon was CEO of
Valassis Communications, Inc., a promotions
company - there was an old, vacant airline
hangar at Willow Run Airport in Ann Arbor.
With Brandon leading, it was turned into the
site of a party. Employees dressed as pilots
and flight attendants, there was ambient
lighting and a B-52 aircraft gave rides to
pleased workers.
"He always does everything with
panache," said Domino's Executive
Vice President Lynn Liddle. "Big
into celebrating wins and throw-
ing parties. Fireworks, there's
always fireworks. Wherever
there can be fireworks, there
are fireworks."
Fans in Michigan Stadium
the evening of Sept. 7 might
say that Brandon has brought
a similar approach to his job
as athletic director at the
University. The second night
game against Notre Dame,
Under The Lights II, brought
the fireworks. It brought
Beyonce to the video board,
a light show at halftime and
flyovers - plural, a handful of
flyovers. The celebrities of the
Michigan athletics world turned
out for the event, too.
Those football fans may also
recall a man flying out of Michigan
Stadium at halftime via jetpack during
the Central Michigan University game.
They'll recall the Big Chill - an outdoor
hockey game, played under the lights, at the
Big House on Dec. 11, 2010.
As Brandon begins his fourth academic
year at the helm of Michigan sports, his
administration can be characterized as one
of "more."
More staff members: After an initial
reduction of staff from 275 to 190 upon
replacing Bill Martin, the former athletic
director, the number of department employ-
ees has expanded to 308.
More money: Compared to $96 million in
revenue in 2008-09, the last full year before
he took over, Brandon projects $146.4 mil-
lion in revenue for the upcoming year.
More facilities: Though renovations to

of the 2012-13 school year. Bo's belief.
But Brandon's This was in the
entry into cut- heat of the

tions on Twitter.
"They just established such a work ethic
and such a perfectionist attitude," Eaton
said. "Everything was discipline and work
hard: Do every little thing correctly."
Brandon and Eaton were schooled early on
that Michigan held a special place in college
athletics. They learned that the University
was not subject to the same standards as all
the others - Michigan deserved more, Eaton
and Brandon said in former interviews. It
deserved the fireworks.
His hire in 2010 as athletic director may
have been his first foray into athletic admin-
istration, but Brandon was in the University's
power circle dating back to 1998 when he was
elected to the University's Board of Regents
by a statewide vote, a position he held until
2006. As a regent, he played a significant
role in bringing in University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman in 2002, who
in turn hired Brandon as athletic
director.
Compared to Bo's era, Bran-
don's present world is differ-
ent, but the need to retain the
edge remains constant. Just as
competitive as Schembechler,
Brandon refuses to fall behind
in the race of college sports.
Fan happiness and the
traditional, simple joys of
Michigan sports are fine, but
the modern Athletics Depart-
ment is out for something
else. It needs the most money
to build the best facilities.
It needs the best facilities to
land the best recruits. The best
recruits to win the most games.
Win the most games to build the
best brand, so the cycle restarts -
over and over.
Brandon has played the role of car-
nival barker, calling out for all to come
see the big-tent circus in Ann Arbor. A
smartphone app was introduced to promote
steadfast loyalty from Michigan students to
the athletic teams. As the department admit-
ted last week, skywriters were hired to draw
Michigan-positive phrases in the air on
game days. Games have been marketed with
tag lines, new jerseys have been introduced
and the Michigan Legends uniform number
system was implemented, in which current
players deemed deserving are given the jer-
sey of a Wolverine great from yesteryear.
Branding hasn't been the only thing cur-
poratized about Michigan athletics. Michi-
gan is remarkably vigilant in controlling its
message. Media access is limited, and play-
ers are coached to be tight-lipped. You won't
find Michigan coaches or players straying

from the company line.
"It's no secret that Dave is creating a cul-
ture with the Athletic Department that is
very defined and is important to his suc-
cess," Basketball Coach John Beilein said.
His polarizing nature
But recently, Brandon the businessman
has made some decisions to alienate seg-
ments of the student body, some of which
have led to backlash against Brandon per-
sonally.
First, there was the unilateral decision
to change the football student seating to a
general admission format. That came along
with a price hike. There was outrage against
the new policy and outrage that the depart-
ment hadn't bothered to consult the students
about the dramatic policy change.
Most recent was the change in the basket-
ball student ticketing policy. Season tickets
were oversold, and a new policy for claim-
ing games was instituted just over a month
before the season began. Students were no
longer guaranteed all the games they paid
for. Their only recourse: geta refund. There
was considerable pushback from stu-
dents, but ultimately, the department
found a way to get more seats filled for
more games.
Despite his successes, there's
some resentment from students
towards Brandon, stemming
from the "money-grubbing
athletic director" perception
they've developed in response
to recent changes.
But the flipside of that coin
is a magnanimous leader, one
in touch with the world out-
side Michigan athletics and
intent on making someone's
day.
There's the gesture of invit-
ing Grant Reed, a 12-year-old
cancer survivor that named his
tumor "Michigan," to be Brady
Hoke's guest for "The Game"
against Ohio State in November.
Then, there was Cooper Barton,
the five-year old Oklahoman who
was forced to turn his Michigan shirt
inside out at school. So Brandon invit-
ed him to Michigan Stadium to be intro-
duced at halftime last year.
Of course, there's the cynical view that
Brandon knows a good publicity opportunity
when he sees one. But it's hardly all a front.
One thing Brandon can't be accused of is act-
ing out of character.
Just a couple weeks ago, an employee at
Domino's suffered the loss of their toddler. It
was a difficult week for the entire company,
where Brandon serves as chairman. Though
Brandon was busy preparing for Under the
Lights II, he found the time to attend the
funeral and put a sympathetic arm around
the pained parent.
Domino's also suffered a rough period
earlier in the decade. Sales were up, but the
company wasn't meeting its profit targets.
That meant no bonuses.

Brandon went to the company's board
and explained how morale was down. The
employees needed a win - something to feel
good about. Brandon was able to convince
the board members to get everyone an extra
paycheck.
"People were in the lobby crying because
Dave got us an extra paycheck," recalled
Liddle, his Domino's co-worker dating back
to the 1990s. "I think he really does care a lot
about people and he wants to help them cel-
ebrate when they win and he wants to shore
them up when they're not winning."
Just Dave
When Liddle came to Domino's for an
interview, she mistook the lobby for a phys-
ical therapy clinic. It looked
nothing like the pala-
tial corporate

rise, Frank Lloyd Wright-style complex.
"That lobby has the stamp of Dave Bran-
don all over it," Liddle said. "He actually
worked with designers and got all of us
involved and jackhammered the whole cen-
ter of the building."
The remodeled lobby moved the CEO suite
from the outskirts of the complex to the floor
above the lobby. Front and center, where he
could be visible to everyone. He wanted to be
an accessible CEO.
He'd come into the company and made his
presence felt. The differences were tangible
and often hard to ignore.
When he came in as CEO in 1999, he
changed the conservative culture. It was
no longer suits for the men and skirts for
the women. He wanted everyone comfort-
able and happy when they
came to work. When
addressed as

His decision-making was just as precise.
"There must always be avision and a strat-
egy and a way to measure and know how
you're doing so you can benchmark against
yourself," Liddle said. "He's got somewhat
of a formula that he uses that is consistently
results producing."
Perhaps the most scrutinized choice
Brandon made was Domino's self-critical ad
campaign.
As the Brandon administration wound
down to give way to new CEO Patrick Doyle
in late 2009, the company launched a mar-
keting crusade against its very own product.
Commercials showed consumers complain-
ing about the quality of the pizza. A new
recipe would be introduced. Domino's was
admitting that the product it had cooked all
these years was deficient.
The employees in charge of the menu
would come to Brandon with improvements,
and they'd be sent back. He'd tell them to go
back to the drawing board. Domino's needed
a distinctive change, and he wouldn't accep
the new recipe until there was a true, notice-
able difference.
It wasn't the safe move for Brandon, as
the campaign would affect his legacy
as CEO. But the company knew the
pizza could be better. What began
with tweaking the recipe, ended up
changing the crust, changing the
sauce and changing the cheese.
The commercials showed that
Brandon had no qualms about
making the big move. He was
going to do what he wanted.
As Liddle explained, Amef&
ica was at a point where
the banks were folding and
nobody trusted corporate
America. People were losing
their houses. It was a nasty
time, and nobody was just
saying it like it is.
"He will look at a prob-
lem unemotionally," Liddle
explains. "He will say, what's
the right thing to do? He'll think
through how will this affect
my organization, how will this
affect the competition, how will
this affect the industry, what are the
financial implications? And then he
always tries to put a creative spin on it."
Fighting the three-front battle
It's said that athletics is the only business
with two bottom lines. At a place like Michi-
gan, there may as well be a third.
There's the winning and the money-mak-
ing, but then there's the demands of being at
a public research university with a rabid faan
base that treasures the idea of Michigan ath-
letics just as much as it treasures the teams
themselves.
There are those who see a problem in
turning the enterprise of amateur athletics
into big business.

sports historian, points out in his recent
