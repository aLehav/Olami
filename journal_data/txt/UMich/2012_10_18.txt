STATE BALLOT PROPOSALS

Measure would
amend constitution
to preserve union
rights in Mich."
By TUI RADEMAKER
Daily StaffReporter
Michigan voters will have
the opportunity to impact the
future of collective bargaining

in the state when they vote on
the controversial Proposal 2 on
Nov. 6.
The union-backed measure
would permanently place col-
lective bargaining rights in the
state constitution and prevent
the passage of anti-union legis-
lation.
The proposal comes in the
wake of a series of anti-union
legislation that passed in Wis-
consin, Indiana and Ohio within
the past two years. The proposal

is an attempt by union sup-
porters to proactively prevent
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder
from enacting.laws-similar
to those passed in the nearby
states that restrict union rights.
According to Gregory Saltzman,
an economics professor at
Albion University and a public
health lecturer at the Univer-
sity.
However, Saltzman said he
believes Snyder currently has no
plans to suggest such a contro-

versial piece of legislation.
"I do think Michigan is a
state where labor unions are
stronger than average in the
United States," Saltzman said.
"Governor Snyder has specifi-
cally said he doesn't want to
stir up a hornet's nest by having
legislation like Wisconsin, Ohio
and Indiana had ... essentially
this constitutional amendment
maintains the status quo."

It's all Greek to me

What did you study when
you were a student?
I studied classics, so I
spent most of my undergradu-
ate years learning Latin and
Greek. I came into college with
the, idea that I was interested
in history and I thought, "Well,
let's start with the Greeks.
That sounds like a good start-
ing point and I'll gradually
move forward through time."
But I got hooked on the Greeks.
Which classes do you
teach?
I teach a whole range of
classes. At the undergradu-

ate level I teach language
classes. I'm teaching a course
on Herodotus - the so-called
father of history - the one
who founded the whole genre
of historical writings.
Can you tell me about
yourbook "Exile, Ostracism
and Democracy: The Poli-
tics of Expulsion in Ancient
Greece"?
My first book was on ostra-
cism. That goes back to a legal
practice of the Athenians
where they had a formal vote
on whether they wanted to
exile anybody from the city for
10 years. People were puzzled

about that. My book is trying
to explain that it was actually
fairly democratic - it was a
popular vote.
What are some of your
research techniques?,
One of my favorite tech-
niques with these texts is to
read between the lines - to
pick out the episodes that
aren't the major wars or major
figures. But what are the inci-
dental episodes along the
way and what do they reveal
about the culture? It's reading r
against the grain.

Chinese economy slows

FDR memorial park dedicated in
NYC after decades of legal disputes

Economy grew at
7.4 percent in the
third quarter
BEIJING (AP) - China's eco-
nomic growth tumbled to the
lowest in more than three years
in the latest quarter but retail
sales and investment improved
in a possible sign a painful
slump might be stabilizing.
The world's second-largest
economy grew 7.4 percent in
the three months ending in Sep-
tember, data showed Thursday.
That was down from the previ-
ous quarter's 7.6 percent and the
lowest since the first quarter of
2009.
Retail sales rose 14.4 per-
cent, a small acceleration over
the first half of the year, and
investment in industrial assets

and some other indicators also
showed small improvements.
"Judging from the third
quarter figures, we can see a
clear sign of steady economic
growth," said Sheng Laiyun,
spokesman for the National
Bureau of Statistics, at a news
conference. "There is a smaller
margin of decline and some
major indicators have been
growing faster."
Analysts expect China's eco-
nomic growth to rebound late
this year or early next year but
say a recovery is likely ti be too
weak to drive global growth
without improvement in the
United States and Europe.
The slowdown is due large-
ly to government lending and
investment controls imposed
to cool an overheated economy
and inflation. But the down-
turn worsened sharply lastyear

after global demand for Chi-
nese goods plunged unexpect-
edly.
The government has cut
interest rates twice since early
June and is injecting money
into the economy through high
investment by state companies
and spending on building air-
ports, subways and other pub-
lic works. But authorities have
avoided launching a massive
stimulus after huge spending in
response to the 2008 global cri-
sis fueled inflation and a waste-
ful building boom.
Premier Wen Jiabao, the
country's top economic offi-
cial, said Wednesday growth
appeared to be stabilizing and
he expressed confidence the
country can meet its official
targets for the year. Wen gave
no growth forecast or a possible.
time frame for a recovery.

Monument erected
on Roosevelt Island
in the East River
NEW YORK (AP) - Dignitar-
ies on Wednesday dedicated a
new memorial state park over-
looking the United Nations to
former President Franklin Roos-
evelt.
The Franklin D. Roosevelt
Four Freedoms Park, on an island
in the East River, "will stand for-
ever as a monument to the man
who brought us through the
Great Depression and brought us
victory over great evil," Mayor
Michael Bloomberg told several
hundred people at the dedication
ceremony, celebrating a design 40
years in the making.
Former President Bill Clinton

for America" and the park should

remind the nation his lofty goals
are worth pursuing.
The triangular park is named
after Roosevelt's 1941 State of
the Union address, known as the
Four Freedoms Speech, given
before America got involved in
World War II. Roosevelt said
the way to justify the enormous
sacrifice of war was to create a
world centered on four essential
human freedoms: freedom of
speech and expression, freedom
of worship, freedom from want
and freedom from fear. The
words were later incorporated
into the charter of the United
Nations.
The park sits on Roos-
evelt Island, a 2-mile slice of
land between Manhattan and
Queens. The 4-acre expanse
of green is flanked by 120 trees
leading to a colossal bronze bust
of Roosevelt at the threshold of a
white granite open-air plaza.
The statue is an enlargement
of a 28-inch bust of Roosevelt,
also a New York governor, cre-
ated by American sculptor Jo
Davidson. It sits in a stone niche
on the back of which a passage
from the Four Freedoms speech
is carved. The statue sits a mere
300 yards across the river from
the headquarters of the United

Nations, which Roosevelt helped
found.
The park will open to the pub-
lic on Oct. 24.
Former U.S. Ambassador to
the U.N. William vanden Heuvel,
chairman of the Franklin D. Roo-
sevelt Four Freedoms Park LLC,
said, "We hope visitors of differ-
ent ages will understand that the
four freedoms are the core values
of democracy and that each gen-
eration has to be sure to protect
them."
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller
and Mayor John Lindsay first
announced creation of the
memorial park and appointed.
Louis Kahn as its architect
in 1973. Vanden Heuvel, who
was there that day, said Kahn
completed the drawings a year
later. That year, Rockefeller
became vice president, and
the city verged on bankruptcy.
With no money, the park was
shelved.
The project was revived by
vanden Heuvel in 2005 after. an
Oscar-nominated documentary
about Kahn, "My Architect,"
brought renewed interest.
Over the next seven years, $53
million was raised, $34 million
from private donors. The rest
came from the city and the state.

Report: Libyan
rebels 'executed'
Gadhafi, loyalists

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed sits at a defenseotable wearinga camouflage vest in front of military judge U.S. Army Col. James Pohl
Accused 9 11 plotter speaks
to tribunal about hypocrisy

50-page report
says militias
took revenge on
prisoners
CAIRO (AP) - Libyan reb-
els appear to have "summar-
ily executed" scores of fighters
loyal to Moammar Gadhafi,
and probably the dictator him-
self, when they overran his
hometown a year ago, a human
rights group said Wednesday.
The report by Human Rights
Watch on alleged rebel abuses
that followed the October 2011
capture of the city of Sirte in
the final major battle of the
eight-month civil war is one of
the most detailed descriptions
of what the group says were
war crimes committed by the
militias that toppled Gadhafi,
and which still play a major
role in Libyan politics today.
The 50-page report, titled
"Death of a Dictator: Bloody
Vengeance in Sirte," details
the last hours of Gadhafi's life
on Oct. 20, 2011, when he tried
to flee the besieged city. The
longtime leader's convoy was
struck by NATO aircraft as it
tried to escape and the survi-
vors were attacked by militias

from the city of Misrata, who
captured and disarmed the dic-
tator and his entourage.
Misrata was subjected to a
brutal weeks-long siege by Gad-
hafi's forces that killed hun-
dreds of residents, and fighters
from the city became among
the regime's most implacable
foes. HRW says it seems the
Misratans took revenge against
their prisoners in Sirte.
"The evidence suggests that
opposition militias summarily
executed at least 66 captured
members of Gadhafi's convoy
in Sirte," said Peter Bouck-
aert, emergencies director at
Human Rights Watch.
The New York-based group's
report says that new evidence
unearthed in its investigation
includes a mobile phone video
clip taken by militiamen show-
ing a large number of prisoners
from Gadhafi's convoy being
cursed and abused by opposi-
tion fighters.
The remains of least 17 of the
detainees in the phone video
were later identified in a group
of 66 bodies found at Sirte's
Mahari hotel, some still with
their hands tied behind their
back. Human Rights Watch
said it used hospital morgue
photos to confirm the victims'
identities.

Khalid Sheikh
Mohammed wears
previously banned
camouflage vest
GUANTANAMO BAY
NAVAL BASE, Cuba (AP) - The
self-styled terrorist mastermind
of the Sept. 11 attacks lectured
a military court on government
hypocrisy Wednesday and wore
a previously banned camou-
flage vest to his pretrial hear-
ing before being rebuked by the
judge for his comments.
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed
was in court as part of a week-
long hearing focusing largely on
the secrecy rules that will gov-
ern legal proceedings against
him at the U.S. base in Cuba.
Mohammed was allowed to
wear a hunting-style camou-
flage vest with his white tunic
and turban over the objections
of prosecutors, who feared it
might disrupt the proceedings.
It had no apparent effect,
but his five-minute speech
denouncing the government's
arguments about the need to
protect national security trans-
fixed the court and drew a repri-
mand from the judge.
Until that point, the 47-year-
old Mohammed sat quietly
through a day of courtroom
arguments on proposed rules
for handling classified evidence
in the war-crimes case. When
he finally spoke, it was to point
out what he saw as the prosecu-
tion's hypocrisy for seeking to
keep secret some details of what
happened to him during years of

captivity in the CIA's secret pris-
ons.
Mohammed told the judge,
Army Col. James Pohl, that "the
government uses national secu-
rity as it chooses," urging him to
keep that in mind as he considers
requests from defense lawyers
and the American Civil Liberties
Union to scale back the rules for
evidence and testimony.
"Many can kill people under
the name of national security, and
to torture people under the name
of national security," the Ara-
bic-speaking Mohammed said
through a translator. "And detain
theirunderagechildrenunder the
name of national security."
In an apparent reference
to Osama bin Laden, Moham-
med noted that "the president
can take someone and throw
them into the sea in the name of
national security."
He also made an oblique ref-'
erence to Anwar al-Awlaki, the
American-Yemeni militant killed
in a September 2007 U.S. drone
strike, and told the judge not
to be affected by the "crocodile
tears" of prosecutors when they
refer to the nearly 3,000 people
killed in the 2001 attacks.
"When the government feels
sad for the killing of 3,000 on
Sept. 11, we also should feel sorry
that the U.S. government ... has
killed thousands of people,"
Mohammed said, before cor-
rectinghimself to say millions of
people.
"Your blood is not made of gold
and ours is made of water. We are
all human beings," he said.
Pohl had allowed Mohammed
to make the statement, but then
said he wouldn't allow it to hap-

pen again.
"This is a onetime occur-
rence," the judge said. "No mat-
ter how heartfelt, I am not going
to entertain personal comments
of any accused about the ways
things are going."
Mohammed, who has told
authorities he was behind the
hijacking plot, is charged along
with four co-defendants with
crimes that include terrorism
and murder. He has a history
of making inflammatory state-
ments in the handful of times
when he has had an opportunity
to speak.
In a closed 2007 appearance
before a panel of military offi-
cers, he compared bin Laden to
George Washington, boasted
about planning the Sept. 11
attacks "from A to Z," and said he
personally beheaded Wall Street
Journal reporter Daniel Pearl
with his "blessed right hand,"
according to atranscript.
At his first public court hear-
ing in 2008, he chanted verses
of the Quran and said he would
welcome becoming a martyr for
his Sept. 11 role. The following
year he released a written state-
ment callingthe attacks a "noble
victory."
Mohammed, whose bushy
beard is dyed a rust color with
henna, sees himself a prisoner
of war and has sought the same
right to wear a uniform as Japa-
nese and German troops prose-
cuted for war crimes after World
War II. In the defendant's case,
his uniform is similar to what he
wore as a mujahideen fighter in
Bosnia and Afghanistan, said one
of his lawyers, Army Capt. Jason
Wright.

Man pleads guilty in plot
to kill Saudi ambassador

Supposed drug
dealer hired to
carry out bombing
in Washington
NEW YORK (AP) - A Texas
man pleaded guilty Wednes-
day to plotting to assassinate
Saudi Arabia's ambassador to'
the United States, agreeing
to hire what he thought was a
drug dealer in Mexico last year
for $1.5 million to carry out
the attack with explosives at a
Washington restaurant.
Manssor Arbabsiar, 57,
entered the plea to two con-
spiracy charges and a murder-
for-hire count in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan, where
Judge John F. Keenan repeat-
edly asked Arbabsiar whether
he intended to kill the ambas-
sador. Arbabsiar, a U.S. citizen
who holds an Iranian passport,
said he did.
Sentencing was set for Jan.
23, when defense lawyers are
likely to cite their claims that
Arbabsiar is bipolar in asking
ag O

for leniency. He faces up to 25
years in prison.
Assistant U.S. Attorney
Edward Kim asked Arbabsiar if
Iranian military officials based
in Iran were involved in the
plot. Arbabsiar said they were.
In a news release issued
after the plea, Attorney Gener-
al Eric Holder cited the efforts
of law enforcement and intelli-
gence agencies in disrupting "a
deadly plot approved by mem-
bers of the Iranian military to
assassinate a sitting foreign
ambassador on U.S. soil."
U.S. Attorney Preet Bhar-
ara noted that the harm
likely would have extended
beyond the ambassador, call-
ing Arbabsiar "the extended
murderous hand of his co-
conspirators, officials of the
Iranian military based in Iran,
who plotted to kill the Saudi
Ambassador in the United
States and were willing to kill
as many bystanders as neces-
sary to do so."
He said Arbabsiar "was in
telephone contact with his
Iranian confederates while he
brokered an audacious olot."

'Binders full of women' effort predated
Romney according to women's coalition

Employees
deny candidate
requested
applications
BOSTON (AP) - Members
of a coalition of Massachusetts
women's groups on Wednesday
disputed Mitt Romney's asser-
tion that he requested the names
of potential female candidates
for high-level, state positions
when he was elected governor.
"To be perfectly clear, Mitt
Romney did not request those
resumes," Jesse Mermell, a
former executive director of
Massachusetts Government
Appointments Project, told
reporters during a conference
call arranged by the Democratic
Party.
Democrats arranged
Wednesday's call to help blunt
the Republican's efforts in the
final weeks of the presidential
campaign to appeal to female
voters. Polls show women favor-
ing President Barack Obama
over Romney.
Romney, responding to a
question during Tuesday night's
presidential debate about equal
pay and opportunities for
women, said that in the process
ofassemblinga cabinet as gover-
nor he was disappointed to find
that most applicants were men.
He said he then asked women's
groups for help finding qualified
female candidates.
"I went to a number of wom-

en's groups and said, 'Can you
help us find folks,' and they
brought us whole binders full
of women," Romney said. The
"binders full of women" remark
sparked an instant wave of social
media parodies of the phrase.
Mermell, a Democrat and
town official in Brookline,
Mass., said Romney did not
request any names after his
2002 election. Instead, she said
MassGAP approached Rom-
ney's team as part of its effort,
begun before the election, to
make sure that more women
were appointed to senior posi-
tions in the new administration.
MassGAP describes itself
as a nonpartisan coalition of
women's groups interested in
boosting the number of women
in top state government jobs.
The coalition said it approached
the nominees of both major par-
ties after the election, Romney
and Democrat Shannon O'Brien,
and secured commitments from
both that, if elected, they would
work with the organization to
identify potential female candi-
dates for senior-level positions.
Romney's campaign declined
to respond to Mermell and
referred questions to Kerry
Healey, who was Romney's lieu-
tenant governor. Healey said
Romney went beyond the ini-
tial contact with MassGAP by
reaching out to acquaintances
in the business world and oth-
ers to help meet his pledge to fill
more administration posts with
women.
Healey served as a liaison

to MassGAP and reviewed the
binders with resumes of poten-
tial candidates.
"Gov. Romney not only sup-
ports equal pay for equal work,
but he goes beyond that by
working to support women to
reach the highest levels of gov-
ernment," Healey said.
Mermell questioned Rom-
ney's commitment to helping
women get ahead in the work-
place.
"The fact that he needed our
help says everything you need
to know about his true com-
mitment to advance women in
office," she said. Mermell added
that it was "shocking that after
25 years of professional experi-
ence at the very highest level of
corporate America, Mitt Rom-
ney needed our help."
In a statement, MassGAP said
the number of women in senior-
level posts climbed from about
30 percent to 42 percent during
the first two years of Romney's
administration.
A 2004 survey by the State
University of New York found
Massachusetts was first in the
nation in the percentage of
women in top state positions.
MassGAP, however, noted the
percentage later dropped to 25
percent in Romney's final two
years in office.
The way it worked was not
quite the way it was described
last night," said Ruth Bramson,
who was hired as Romney's
chief human resource officer
after her resume was spotted in
a binder. "He was half-right."

iling security
Open communication with regents is crucial
n September, the University announced heightened security
measures would be implemented for Board of Regents meet-
ings. Those attending the public meetings are now required
to pass through metal detectors and bag checks before entering the
room. A rope surrounds the regents' table, separating the elected
officials from attendees. While ensuring the safety of all in the
University's community is important, these measures distance the
regents from the public, both physically and metaphorically. Open
communication between the regents and the public - especially stu-
dents - is crucial to the development of the University, and should
be fostered in the regents' monthly meetings.

Smart uses for smartphones

t's a typical classroom scene.
Your professor is lecturing
without the help of Power-
Point slides on a
deep topic while
you diligently
take notes. He

assignment, and
you find the syl-
labus to check
when it's due. HEMA
The date of the KARUNA-
next exam is KARAM
announced, so
you open your
calendar to add a reminder about
it. You're staying on top of every-
thing - but the professor and your
classmates still shoot you annoyed
glances. Why? Because you've been
on your phone the entire time.
There's no doubt that smart-
phones have vastly affected the
way we function every day. As of
2012, nearly half of all American
adults use smartphones, and the
share is even greater among col-
lege students - 54 percent. Their
infiltration into our daily functions
is apparent everywhere: people
no longer carry notepads, plan-
ners, MP3 players, cameras and,
with apps like Square, sometimes
even cash and credit cards. How-
ever, even with (or perhaps because
of) their convenience, there's still
a stigma associated with using
phones in certain settings.
The advent and growth of tex-
ting over the past decade or so - for
many of us, our entire teenage and
college years - created immedi-
ate access to instant communica-
tion literally at our fingertips. But
it was almost too good to be true,
and it didn't take long for texting
to be prohibited in places like class-
rooms, offices and dinner tables. So,
of course, we all mastered stealthily
hiding phones under desks, looking

down towards our fingers tapping
away while also looking up occa-
sionally, feigning interest in what
we should have been doing - the
classic looking-like-I'm-not-tex-
ting-even-though-I-really-am pose.
In college, using phones during
class isn't a punishable offense, but
it's still frowned upon. Even during
casual social interactions, we get
annoyed when our friends whip out
their phones, choosing technology
to supposedly communicate with
friends who are elsewhere instead of
talking to those physically present.
But would we be as annoyed if they
had instead pulled out a pento scrib-
ble down an address, or asked some-
one what day of the week Halloween
was this year? Phones are used for
so much more than just calling or
texting, but the social acceptance of
phone usage hasn't quite caught up.
Of course, people who are on
their phones at perceived bad times
might not actually be doing any-
thing of use. After all, we've all
seen people playing Angry Birds
or Scramble with Friends dur-
ing class. We've seen people hold
lengthy text conversations while
eating dinner instead of talking
with those in front of them. Occa-
sionally, we've even seen that girl
in class who couldn't keep herself
from pulling out her phone to take
a picture through the curtain of her
hair of that guy wearing the weird
shorts. The association of using
phones with not paying attention or
being rude is justified by real situa-
tions such as these. But it's impor-
tant to recognize that not all phone
use is necessarily useless or unpro-
ductive - many times, it serves an
important purpose.
For me, my iPhone is about more
than just convenience - it's also
part of my personal sustainability
goal for the year to use less paper
and electricity. I've optimized my
phone to handle many functions

that formerly required paper - the
Google Drive app is a godsend - and
I use it every day not only in lieu of
notebooks, but also, when possible,
computers. In fact, even this column
was written on my phone. The digi-
tal revolution has made it easier for
everyone to take baby steps toward
being more environmentally friend-
ly, but our social norms might be
preventing it from truly transform-
ing our lives.

Social norms
are preventing
productive use of
our best tools.

a

Our generation needn't be
pushed to take greater advantage of
technology. We're often already at
the top of the curve when it comes
to advancements, especially with
smartphones. But while it's impor-
tant to be tasteful in what we use
our smartphones for, it's equally
important to recognize that many
others are also using their phones
tastefully. To my professors: Maybe
I am playing Temple Run during
your lecture. But maybe I'm tak-
ing notes, looking up information I
don't understand, scheduling time
for study sessions - things you
would look favorably upon. And a
message to everyone, give people
the benefit of the doubt when it
comes to using smartphones. As
cliche as it seems, there really is a
world of information at our finger-
tips, and some of us just want to
make the most of it.

The Board of Regents is responsible for
managing the University's budget, as well as
major academic and property decisions. This
power directly affects students. Whether the
debate is over academics or athletics, stu-
dents should be able to voice their concerns
directly to the regents. At each meeting, time
is set aside for public comment, but several
speaking restrictions are in place and indi-
vidual regents generally don't respond to the
comments at the meeting. This, along with
placing a rope around the regents, creates an
atmosphere of separation instead of one that
promotes interactions between the students
and those who in effect govern them. The
regents should represent students, but these
high-security measures suggest they aren't
making an effort to reach out.
The heightened securitymeasures appear
to reflect growing concerns over safety in
public forums. These procedural changes
are "part of our ongoing effort to enhance
safety on campus," according to a Universi-
ty press release. Yet these measures haven't
been extended to any other part of campus
aside from monthly meetings with high-
ranking officials. Other publicly elected
boards, like city councils, haven't set up

this many barriers to public interaction. If
Detroit's city council can host public meet-
ings without a rope separating leaders from
the public, the University's regents should
be able to do the same.
Ensuring safety is important, but so is
keeping the regents accountable. Despite
their responsibilities, the regents are not
any more important than the University's
students and faculty. The regents should
be approachable and willing to listen to the
people who are directly affected by their
decisions. These meetings should serve as a
means to increase dialogue between the pub-
lic and the regents - placing the board on a
pedestal won't facilitate this.
For the 2012-2013 academic year the Uni-
versity has a budget of more than $6 billion.
Though others may give input on how this
money is spent, ultimately, the regents have
final say on the budget. The University should
make it a priority to allocate these funds
properly and effectively, and in order to do
that, the voices of students, faculty and gen-
eral public should be heard. And if the Uni-
versity doesn't feel these security measures
should be toned down, then its commitment
to its constituents should be questioned.

Energy and the Environment

PHIL BRENZ AND BRENT GOODMAN I

ANNIKA DONER VIPI

Time to.tap into coal and oil Environmentally committed

President Barack Obama's energy plan is disas-
trous for the country. In January 2008, then-presi-
dential candidate Obama stated, "Under my plan of
acap-and-tradesystem, electricityrateswould nec-
essarily skyrocket." Higher electricity prices mean
the cost of everything will "necessarily" increase,
from the price of heat to the price of gas at the
pump. Neither college students nor other Ameri-
cans can afford this. An increase in electricity costs
will undoubtedly result in increased college operat-
ing costs, necessitating another increase in tuition.
President Obama also opposes the planned Key-
stone XL oil pipeline, despite the boon this pipe-
line would bring to the United States. Secretary of
Energy Steven Chu discussed the administration's
energy plan: Keep fossil fuel prices high in order
to make "alternative" options artificially more
appealing. He stated, "Somehow we have to figure
out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels
in Europe." Although Mr. Chu later recanted this
statement, the failure of the administration to take
any action to lower gas prices has discredited this
change of heart. The administration used stimulus
funding to subsidize about 25 alternative energy
companies, three of which later failed. After the
Deepwater Horizon oil spill, President Obama also
approved a moratorium on oceanic oil exploration,
which prevents companies from accessing key off-
shore oil reserves. This shrinks the supply of oil,
which raises prices. Obama's energy plan hurts the
U.S. economy and unnecessarily spends billions of
taxpayer dollars.
By contrast, Republican presidential nominee
Mitt Romney's plan provides an energy solution
thathelpsthe economyinstead ofhinderingit. Rom-
ney supports the completion of the Keystone XL oil
pipeline from Canada to the United States. This
will create thousands of jobs for American work-

ers - engineers, architects, etc. - and provide
cheaper energy for Americans. Romney opposes
the current policies that aim to increase elec-
tricity prices. He supports using America's coal
reserves to provide energy security and reduce
the nation's dependence on foreign oil. According
to the Department of Energy, the United States
contains one-quarter of the world's known coal
reserves - utilizing this coal will decrease the
cost of energy. Romney's plan aims to eliminate
restrictive regu-
lations put in
place by Presi-
dent Obama that This

Romney
opposes President Obama's subsidies to alterna-
tive energy companies - companies that may
soon collapse and leave taxpayers with a finan-
cial loss. Romney will allow the private sector
to decrease the price of energy from oil and coal
through market competition. Unlike the energy
policy of President Obama, Romney's plan will
result in less expensive energy and a stronger
economy.

As young America's getting ready to live in a
world rapidly and irreversibly changing, much
is at stake in the upcoming election - espe-
cially our environment and energy. We need a
president who's looking out for the planet we'll
inhabit for years to come. That president is
Barack Obama.
President Obamaunderstands the importance
of environmental protection - and knows it can
contribute to much-needed job growth. In an
April interview
with Rolling
Stone Obama
a five-part series said, "We're
going to have
)emocrats and to take further
steps to deal
cans that looks with climate
change in a seri-
es leading up to ous way. There's
a way to do it
'n Day. that is entirely
compatible with
strong econom-
ic growth and
job creation."
Obama will take these steps if re-elected. Even
in the midst of a dysfunctional Congress, the
President's administration took unprecedented
action to reduce climate change, dependence on
foreign oil and pollution. The American Recov-
ery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated
more than $80 billion to clean energy proj-
ects, and under Obama, the amount of electric-
ity generated by renewable sources has almost
doubled. Fuel efficiency standards for cars rose
not once, but twice. We're now on track to see
cars averaging 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. He

has also pushed Congress to end the enormous
$4-billion-per-year tax breaks to oil companies.
Energy independence is a critical issue for our
generation, a generation that will be vulnerable i
to energy crises and defense issues if we don't
decrease our current rates of dependence on
foreign oil. Obama understands this. Our depen-
dence on foreign oil has decreased everyyear that
Obama has been in office. The Obama adminis-
tration has also taken aggressive steps to reform
offshore oil drilling, ensuring that our offshore
energy sources are developed responsibly.
In this election, we must choose a candidate
who will protect the environment. While Obama
has shown his dedication to protecting our plan-
et, his opponent is unwilling to do the same.
Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney
has championed coal and oil fuels as the future of
American energy; these sources cause great harm
to our environment and are quickly depleting
without the possibility of renewal. He has even
denied the human impact on climate change. To
be fair, Romney has said that he is "not in this
race to slow the rise of the oceans or to heal the 4
planet," so our expectations for his environmen-
tal policies shouldn't be too high.
This November, our decision is clear. When
we look at both sides, Obama's commitment to
clean energy and the protection of the environ-
ment far surpass his opponent's positions. A vote
for Obama and the Democratic Party represents
a commitment to the future of our world and its
natural resources. Like the energy he champions,
Obama's term in office must be renewed to sus-
tain our environment for the future.

"As Democrats, we believe
it's important that workers who

wonderful University hospitals

Last year many University
students turned their attention
to collective bargaining rights
when the state Court of Appeals
upheld a law that banned Grady-
ate Student Research Assistants
from unionizing. Saltzman said
Proposal 2 would likely incor-
porate GSRAs, effectively over-
turning the current restriction.
"It's a pretty large trial for a
rare disease," Shayman said.
Shayman said he chose to
invest his time in the rare disease
due to the larger implications his
research may have to other ill-
nesses.
"Therapies developed for rare
diseases become applicable to
more common diseases," Shay-
man said. "The most humorous
example is Botox. Botox was
developed, for a rare neurologic
problem and now, obviously, has
widespread use for other pur-
poses."
Cynthia Frank, who suffers
from Gaucher disease and advo-
cates for research, underwent the
Phase 3 trials and said she experi-
enced positive results.
"Every cell in my body feels dif-
ferent. Everything," she said.
"I have a lot less bone pain on

like it put a band-aid on it."

Under current law, tenured
faculty at universities may collec-
tively bargain. However, unlike
institutions such as Eastern
Michigan University and Wayne
State University, University of
Michigan faculty have not exer-
cised these rights, according to
Saltzman.
In a legal memo to Snyder
examining the implications of
Proposal 2, Michigan Attorney
General Bill Schuette predicted
the amendment would repeal
more than 170 existing laws on
collective bargaining.
Jankowski said she fears the
repeal of these laws that she
deems necessary for economic
health.
"Unions already have a lot of
power in the state," Jankowski
said. "It would basically give
unprecedented power to the
unions and union bosses and so
I think that it takes too much
power and puts it in the hands of
the wrong people."
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) supports the law, and
said he feels collective bargain-
ing laws are critical to improving
workplace conditions and have
been beneficial to working and
middle class American families.
"What's happened in the last
few years in the Legislature is
really horrible for working fami-
lies and for individuals who work
for a living and want to protect
their rights in the workplace
environment," Irwin said.
State Representative Mark
Ouimet (R-Ann Arbor) did not
respond to requests for comment.
In a video statement released
on Oct. 12, Lt. Gov. Brian Calley
called the amendment a back-
ward solution with an economic
burden that would cost taxpay-
ers an estimated $1 billion while
establishing a "fourth branch of
government."
"Any agreement (unions)
make would overrule or cannot
be affected by state law," Calley
said in the video. "This would
not work in the interest of kids
we protect with some aspects
of state law, or the elderly, or
in some cases even employees
themselves and the rights they
have enshrined in state law
today," Calley said.

Frank said. "It's changed my qual-

Frank said her hope for the
disease is for it to receive greater
awareness, noting that Gaucher
is now more common than Tay-
Sachs disease - an illness also
commonly found in people of
Jewish descent that impacts the
nervous system and was the sub-
ject of a widespread education
campaign during the 1960s and
1970s.

concern is lackluster funding for
higher education and its negative
impact on the state's economic
growth. She noted that national-
ly, Michigan ranks in the bottom
half in the number of college-
educated adults and the amount
of higher education funding.
"One of the ways that we
build a stronger economy is
through the education system,"
Driskell said. "As astatewe need
to invest in our people and our
students ... cutting funding to
make it affordable is the wrong
way to go."
Driskell said Ouimet has
failed to represent the ideals of
Washtenaw County citizens in
issues concerning education,
the environment and women's
rights.
Ouimet, however, said his
work as a state representative
has been dedicated to lower-
ing taxes for small businesses,
decreasing unemployment and
balancing the state budget.
"People throughout the state
of Michigan understand that the
state is now headed in the right
direction, and they can see it by
median income being up, we've
cut their taxes this coming year

future leaders.
"I want students to go out
with both the recognition of
their accomplishment from
which it's commendable to be
graduating from a great school
like Michigan, but at the same
time also to be prepared to take
that knowledge that they've
gained and use it to make the
world better in whatever way:
being good citizens, being good
parents, good family members,
workers, leaders in every way,"
Kington said.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily, Coleman said
she has heard Kington speak
before and is excited he will be
addressing the graduates this
winter. Coleman called King-
ton, who is the first black and
openly gay president of Grin-
nell College, a "groundbreaking
individual."
"I'm very proud of him,"
Coleman said. "He's a very
inspirational speaker ... He's
very proud of his Michigan her-
itage and he's done a fantastic
job."
Kington noted he was sur-
prised when Coleman called
and asked him to be the speaker.
"I had no idea what she was
calling about," Kington said. "It
was a big surprise."
Kington, who visited Ann
Arbor sporadically while serv-
ing on an advising board for a
study within the Institute for
Social Research after graduat-
ing, said he still visits his former

college town every few years.
During his time at the Uni-
versity he said he especially
enjoyed the city's diversity and
smaller scale in comparison to
his Baltimore upbringing.
"I liked all of the diversity
that you had there with incred-
ible entertainment, and great
restaurants and lots of interest-
ing things to do and at the same
time a scale that wasn't over-
whelming," Kington said. "I
love the city; I had great faculty
and teachers and that was won-
derful. I was exposed to a lot of
the world on that one campus."
To be selected as a com-
mencement speaker and hon-
orary degree recipient, the
University's Honorary Degree
Committee chooses nominees
from a list, which is compiled
throughout the year. Selec-
tions for speakers and honor-
ary degree recipients are made
from the committee's list in the
spring and winter.
Kington and the other hon-
orary degree recipients must
be approved by the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents at their
monthly meeting, which will be
held on Friday at the University
of Michigan - Flint campus.
At the meeting, honorary
degrees are also being recom-
mended to five others includ-
ing Michael Boyd, Molly
Dobson, Cornelia Kennedy,
Joshcka Fischer and Dee Dee
Bridgewater. Coleman said they
are "all very distinguished peo-
ple." The regents will have to
approve these recipients along
with Kington on Friday.
Boyd is the former director
of the Royal Shakespeare Com-

pany and helped to foster part-
nerships with the University
to develop their shows during
his time with the British-based
company. Boyd is being recom-
mended for a Doctor of Humane
Letters.
"During all of the time when
Michigan has had this spe-
cial relationship with the RSC,
Michael has been involved,"
Coleman said. "It's wonderful
that we're going to be able to
honor him."
Dobson, a University alum, is
a philanthropist and volunteer
in Ann Arbor as well as the 2007
Community Foundation Award
winner from the Council of
Michigan Foundations. Dobson
was selected to receive a Doctor
of Laws.
Kennedy, also a University
alum, is the senior judge of the
6th circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
and is nominated to receive a
Doctor of Laws. Kennedy is the
first woman to be a Chief Judge
of a U.S. district court.
Joshcka Fischer previously
taught at the University and
will receive a Doctor of Laws.
Fischer is a German politician
who helped spur the rise in
popularity of the Green party in
Germany. He served as the Ger-
many's Foreign Minister from
1998 until 2005.
Dee Dee Bridgewater, a Flint
native, was selected to receive a
Doctor of Fine Arts. Bridgewa-
ter is a singer and songwriter
who has won three Grammy
Awards and a Tony Award. She
will have her degree conferred
at the University of Michigan -
Flint's Winter Commencement
on Sunday, Dec. 9.

and we have people employed,"
Ouimet said.
According to Ouimet, Michi-
gan has become Newsweek
magazine's No. 1 state for job
growth, is Bloomberg's second-
fastest growing economy and
is ranked seventh by the Tax
Foundation - a nonpartisan
organization that analyzes state
tax burdens.
Ouimet said Driskell's victory
would lead to a reversion to the
time when Jennifer Granholm,
a Democrat, served as governor,
in which he claimed the state
faced numerous difficulties.
"(Driskell) has struggled
with wanting to go back to the
Granholm years of government
where ... the budget was not bal-
anced, we had declining popu-
lation in our state and we had
raised taxes," Ouimet said.
Matt Frendewey, the commu-
nications director for the Michi-
gan Republican Party, said he
believes Ouimet has a good
chance of keeping his House
seat.
"We're confident he will hold
on to his seat," Frendewey said.
"He's done a fantastic job repre-
senting this district."
Frendewey said Ouimet has
a deep understanding of the
district and has had a positive
impact on the state's financial
issues. Frendewey cited Oui-

met's role in reducing the state's
debt and balancing the budget
as evidence of his success.
He added that the Republi-
can majority in the House has
demonstrated that it values the
concerns of Michigan residents
when implementing policy.
"When you compare what the
Republican leadership has done
in the House now, compared
with the Democratic leader-
ship two years ago, there's just
absolutely no comparison,"
Frendewey said. "The Republi-
can majority has the best inter-
est in mind for middle class
families."
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-
Ann Arbor) said Ouimet has
appealed to moderate voters in
the past, which has helped him
maintain his position.
"Mark Ouimet's success in
the past has always been predi-
cated on his ability to get more
moderate Republicans and even
some Democrats to vote for
him," Irwin said.
Irwin added that Ouimet has
campaigned as pro-choice and
pro-education, but has voted
against both ideals during his
time in the House.
"He likes to wear maize and
blue and go to football games
... but he's willing to cut U of M
(funding) by 15 percent," Irwin
said.

He added that MCubed even-
tually hopes to return to a first-
come, first-serve system, but if
the number of proposals con-
tinues to outweigh the available
funding, random cubing will
remain in effect.
Burns said he estimates the
pilot phase will be completed
in about two months, at which
point MCubed will officially
open its website for interaction
and cubing phases to fill the 200
available project slots.
Sile O'Modhrain, an associ-
ate professor of performing
arts technology at the Univer-
sity's School of Music, Theatre
& Dance, is in the process of
submitting a project to MCubed
with Brent Gillespie, an asso-
ciate professor of mechanical
engineering.

O'Modhrain said her proj-
ect aims to improve the current
braille system by placing dots
more compactly resulting in a
more comprehensive, full-page
display that allows users to read
more than one line at a time.
She added that she believes
the random cubing process will
work more effectively than the
first-come, first-serve approach.
"(Random cubing) allows
time for cubes to develop,"
O'Modhrain said. "If it were
first-come, first-served, every-
one would be under pressure
to cube at the beginning of the
process ... whereas this way,
because you know the process
is random, then it may allow for
more time for people to look and
see if they're interested in par-
ticipating in projects."

Syria's wealthy businesses
feel impact of deadly civil war

Pilot Felix Baumgartner of Austria jumps out of his capsule during the final mannedflightfor Red Bull Stratos.
Skydiver's feat could influence
spacesuit design for astronauts

NASA engineers
aim to improve
survival rate of
space travelers
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)
- Now that the dust has settled
in the New Mexico desert where
supersonic skydiver "Fearless
Felix" Baumgartner landed safely
on his feet, researchers are exhil-
arated over the possibility his
exploit could someday help save
the lives of pilots and space travel-
ers in a disaster.
Baumgartner's death-defying
jump Sunday from a balloon
24 miles above Earth yielded a
wealth of information about the
punishing effects of extreme
speed and altitude on the human
body - insights that could inform
the development of improved
spacesuits, new training proce-
dures and emergency medical
treatment.
A NASA engineer who spe-
cializes in astronaut escape sys-
tems said Baumgartner's mission
"gives us a good foundation" for
improving the odds of survival
for professional astronauts, space
tourists and high-altitude pilots
and passengers.
"What I would hope is that,
perhaps, this is just the first step
of many, many advancements to
come" in emergency bailouts,
said Dustin Gohmert, who heads

NASA's crew survival engineer-
ing office at the Johnson Space
Center in Houston.
In an interview after
Baumgartner became the first
skydiver to break the speed
of sound, Gohmert noted that
researchers have spent decades
working on self-contained space
escape systems, with no signifi-
cant advances since Joe Kittinger
in 1960 jumped from 19.5 miles up
and reached 614 mph, records that
stood until Sunday.
Baumgartner's feat was spon-
sored by energy drink maker
Red Bull, and NASA had no role.
But Dr. Jonathan Clark, a former
NASA flight surgeon who lost his
wife, Laurel, in the space shuttle
Columbia accident and dedi-
cated himself to improving crew
escape systems, was in charge of
Baumgartner's medical team.
And he was thrilled at how
much was learned.
By going well beyond Mach 1,
or the speed of sound, Baumgart-
ner provided even more data than
anticipated. Wearing a pressur-
ized suit and helmet, he acceler-
ated to an astonishing 834 mph
and was supersonic longer than
expected. The speed of sound at
that altitude is close to 700 mph.
"It was Mach 1.24, which is
really huge. I mean, that's a much
higher level than we'd ever antici-
pated, so we learned a lot by going
faster and higher," said Clark,
who teaches at the Baylor College
School of Medicine.

Clark said his team is still
analyzing all the medical data -
heart rate, blood pressure and the
like - collected from sensors on
Baumgartner's body.
During his descent through
the stratosphere, Baumgartner
went into an out-of-control spin
for about 40 seconds, experienc-
ing around 2.5 G's, or 2.5 times the
force of gravity, before stabilizing
himself.
Baumgartner's technique for
righting himself may prove useful
for companies like Virgin Galac-
tic that are developing spacecraft
that will take tourists up into
space and right back down. These
enterpriseswill needto have some
sort of emergency escape plan.
NASA's next-generation space-
ship, the Orion vehicle intended
for deep-space exploration, will
parachute home like the old-style
Mercury, Gemini and Apollo cap-
sules. The lessons learned from
Baumgartner's effort probably
won't apply directly to the Orion
design, since it will be safer for
astronauts to remain in the vessel
all the way back to Earth, Gohm-
ert said.
As for the now-ended shuttle
program, Columbia was travel-
ing too high and too fast during
its 2003 descent for a Baumgart-
ner-style exit to have helped the
seven astronauts. The spaceship
broke apart about 40 miles up
while traveling more than Mach
17, unleashing forces that tore the
crew members' bodies apart.

Factories damaged,
international
sanctions hurt
finances
CAIRO (AP) - Syria's wealthy,
long cultivated by President
Bashar Assad as a support for his
regime,areseeingtheirbusiness-
es pummeled by the bloody civil
war. Factories have been burned
down or damaged in fighting.
International sanctions restrict
their finances. Some warn that
their companies are in danger
of going under, worsening the
country's buckling economy.
Assad may not have lost the
backing of Syria's business elite,
but some are losing faith. Many
of those who can have fled
abroad, hoping to ride out the
turmoil, which is now in its 19th
month and is only getting worse
as rebels and regime forces tear
apart the country in their fight
for power.
Several businessmen inter-
viewed by The Associated Press
say resentment is growing
against Assad over the crisis -
but they also aren't throwing
their lot in with the rebellion.
They are hunkering down, trying
to salvage their companies.
One young businessman said
his family factory in the sub-
urbs of Damascus was dam-
aged Wednesday, with windows
blown out and part of the ceiling
was destroyed when warplanes
hit rebels in a neighboring build-
ing. Its several hundred employ-

ees had to hide in the basement
until fighting eased enough that
they could be bused out to safety.
"I feel that they are both just
as bad as each other," he said of
the rebels and the government.
"I could have died today because
they (the rebels) were across
the street from us and they (the
planes) could have bombed us."
Syria's economy has been
heavily hurt by the conflict,
which activists say has left
more than 30,000 dead. Infla-
tion has risen to at least 36 per-
cent. The currency has dropped
around 50 percent, now trad-
ing at 75 pounds to the dollar
on the black market, according
to the factory owner. The gov-
ernment estimates economic
losses at $34 billion - almost
half the gross domestic prod-
uct - though the opposition
puts the losses at nearly three
times that amount. Fuel short-
ages have become widespread
as the regime burns through
hard currency to import diesel
and oil at the same time that it
finances the war effort.
Though the economic blow
has been hard, "we are not at
the stage that the rug has been
pulled from under the regime,"
said Anthony Skinner, head of
Middle East and North African
division at Maplecroft political
risk consultancy.
Assad has so far been able to
keep his head above water with
financial support from top ally
Iran, he noted.
"The question is whether this
is sustainable in the longer term'
and I don't think it is," Skinner

said. "What Assad is counting on
at present is a bare-bones econo-
my that is able to fuel his armed
forces."
The businessmen interviewed
by AP spoke on condition they
remain anonymous and that
some identifying details of their
industries not be specified for
fear of repercussions for talking
about the situation in Syria.
They all come from the coun-
try's Sunni Muslim elite, which
Assad ensured prospered as
he carried out free market
reforms over the past decade.
The reforms transformed the
long isolated nation, bring-
ing in foreign businesses and
chains and greater consumer
goods, though it also sharply
increased the gap between rich
and poor. While the rebellion
has largely been fueled by the
Sunni majority, the elite have
stuck by Assad for most of the
conflict.
The businessmen say they
are caught in the middle - both
of the fighting and of Western
sanctions they say hurt them
more than the regime itself. The
civil war has made it difficult to
distribute goods since roads are
cut off, warehouses have been
shut down and 24-hour opera-
tions have been slashed to eight
hours in places where it is too
risky for employees to travel at
night. Numerous factories have
had to close or reduce produc-
tion. A pharmaceutical compa-
ny in Aleppo was also recently
burned down in the city's fight-
ing, said a businessman with
close ties to the owners.

DC Comics sued the heirs
of artist Joe Shuster in 2010,
seeking a ruling that they lost
their ability to try to reclaim
the superhero's copyrights in
1992. U.S. District Court Judge
Otis Wright II agreed, stating
that Shuster's sister and broth-
er relinquished any chance to
reclaim Superman copyrights
in exchange for annual pension
payments from DC Comics.
Shuster and writer Jerry Sie-
gel created Superman, who made
his comic book debut in 1938 in
Action Comics (hash)1. Both men
battled for increased compensa-
tion for the superhero through-
out their lives and Siegel's heirs
have also foughtDC forastake in
copyrights to Superman.
Shuster's heirs had argued
that the copyright agreements
could be terminated under pro-
visions that allowed creators of
works made before 1978 a mech-
anism to reclaim their rights.
Wright ruled that the decision by
Shuster's sister to accept higher
annual payments created a new
agreement and the pre-1978
rights no longer applied.
"We respectfully disagree
with its factual and legal con-
clusions, and it is surprising
given that the judge appeared
to emphatically agree with our
position at the summary judg-
ment hearing," the Shusters'
attorney Marc Toberoff wrote in
a statement. He declined further
comment, and Warner Bros. and
its attorney Daniel Petrocelli also
declined comment on the ruling.
Toberoff had argued that
an agreement altering copy-
right interests would have been
much longer than the one-page
1992 agreement between DC
Comics and Shuster's sister,
Joan Shuster Peavy, and his
brother, Frank.
The latest Superman film,
"Man of Steel" is scheduled to
land in theaters in 2013. Direc-
tor Zach Snyder told fans ear-
lier this year at Comic-Con that
his film would make the super-
hero more relatable than previ-
ous depictions that showed him
as "a big blue Boy Scout up on
the throne and you can't really
touch him."
In April, the $412 check that
DC Comics wrote to acquire
Superman and other creative
works by Shuster and Siegel
sold for $160,000 in an online
auction.

Her team had no answer for a
Michigan State (4-5 Big Ten, 16-5
overall) squad that was ready for
nearly every play the Michigan

"They executed in all phases

said a displeased Michigan coach
Mark Rosen. "It doesn't matter

The Wolverines ultimately fell
in straight sets to the Spartans,
20-25, 17-25, 20-25, keeping the
state of Michigan's flag - given
to the victor of the series since
1990 - far from their grasp.
Down 6-5 in the first set, the
Wolverines responded with four
straight points, capped by a kill

MEN'S GOLF
Michigan finishes
14th in California

By BEN ESTES
Daily Sports Editor
The hesitation on Elliott Meal-
er's shaggy-bearded face was
obvious.
The fifth-year senior starting
center for the Michigan football
team was asked simply if the
upcoming matchup with in-state
rival Michigan State would be
the offensive line's toughest test
since the opener against Ala-
bama.
After briefly mulling it over,
Mealer decided to not give in
to the temptation to crown the
Spartans.
"I guess I don't know how
to answer that," Mealer said.
"We've played some really good
defenses and they've all been
different. I wouldn't say it is or
isn't, but we've got to be on our
A game. We've got to be ready to
go, because this is a good defense,
and we just got to be ready to go."
Whether or not Mealer or any-
one else wants to actually go out
on a limb and say it, the statistics
indicate that this is, indeed, the
Wolverine's stiffest challenge
since week one.
The Spartans lead the Big
Ten in just about every relevant
defensive category, including
total defense (270.1 yards per
game), scoring defense (15.7
points per game) and rushing
defense (a paltry 91.3 yards per
game).
And they have a mental edge,
too, given their recent success
in this rivalry. The Michigan
offense has struggled to move the
ball each of the last four years in
this game, and not coincidentally,
each of those games ended in a
loss for the Wolverines. Michi-
gan was especially punchless last
season, when the team managed
just 2.3 yards per carry on 36
rushing attempts.
It all means that the Wolver-
ine offensive line will carry the
heavy burden of trying to rem-
edy the offense's recent struggles
against the Spartans.

schedule, offensive coordina-
tor Al Borges elected to air it out
against Alabama and initially, at
least, against Notre Dame. Might
Borges ditch the ground-heavy
attack that's driven Michigan to
two straight dominant wins?
"Michigan State does a good
job as anyone does (stopping.the
run), but you can't abandon what
you do best just because of the
other team," Borges said. "You
have to do what you do, and have
the counterpunches that hope-
fully loosen them up enough that
you can do what you do."
And that means the offensive
line will have to play a cut above
how its performed each of the
four years.

For the Daily
A trip to sunny California
seems like a relaxing way to spend
Fall Break. But for the Michigan
men's golf team, atrip out to Fair-
fax, Calif. for the Alister MacK-
enzie Invitational proved to be
anything but a vacation.
The Wolverines, who conclud-
ed their second and final day of
play on Tuesday, finished 14th out
of 16 teams.
"We need to continue to get a
top-to-bottom team effort," said
Michigan coach Chris Whitten,
"We keep having some strong
individual performances and we
just need more consistency from
the entire lineup."
Senior captain Miguel Echa-
varria had a strong tournament,
and he matched his career-low,
shooting a 3-under 68 in the
second round on Monday. The
second-round tally for Echavar-
ria marked the third time he has
scored that low and also ties the
best round for a Michigan golfer
this season.
"The course wasn't terribly
hard, and I was able to get some
birdies," Echavarria said. r
Despite his success he
expressed frustration with the
team's play asa whole.
"The guys look at Miguel in a
lot of ways off the course to see
how he's going to react," Whitten
said. "With Miguel, his ball strik-
ing is always very good. It's just a
matter of whether he can capital-
ize on his good shots or not, and
he did that the best in the second
round."
Freshman Chris O'Neill also
performed well on day one,
shooting a 2-under 69 in the first
round and a 1-under70 inthe sec-
ond round. O'Neill credited his
performance to his consistency,
highlighting that he played the
par-5's and par-3's better than
usual.

"It was in great shape," O'Neill
said of the course. "It was a
course where you could shoot a
good score if you were playing
well."
Added Whiten: "Chris is get-
ting more and more comfortable
in the events. He's pretty close
to a complete player. He's a great
ball striker. He worked hard on
his putting before coming to this
tournament. ... I think the guys
are building some trust in him."
Sophomore Noori Hyun was
disqualified in the first round on
Monday for using an illegal club.
"He had a club that was altered
during the round, and the rules
say that once a club is bent you
can't use it again," Whitten said.
According to the coach, Hyun
was unaware of the rule. He was
allowed to play in the subsequent
second and third rounds with
his scores counting towards the
team total.
Despite some strong perfor-
mances on Monday, Michigan
finished just three spots from the
bottom, a position it held until
the end of play. The Wolverines
finished the tournament with a
team score of 868 (294, 286, 288),
well behind California, which
won the tournament with an
overall team score of a 46-under
806.
Michigan will finish its season
at the Stanford Classic in Palo
Alto, Calif in two weeks. Whit-
ten knows the competition will
again be tough. One area he said
he'd like his team to improve in is
putting.
"We really want to be one of
the best putting teams in the
country," Whitten said.
Putting and a strong perfor-
mance from Echavarria and
O'Neill could result in the Wol-
verines getting the type of finish
they have been hoping for.
"We know we're good and we
know we can improve," Echavar-
ria said.

How students pursue
animation at the 'U'

n 2001, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sci-
ences gave the green light for a newly recognized
category in the upcoming Academy Awards: Best
Animated Feature.
. It was a subtle mark of changing opportunities for
animators and their fans. Animation's status as an art
form was finally garnering legitimacy, encouraging the
genre to push new boundaries by embracing exciting and
unorthodox innovations - all while emerging from the
shadows of the monopoly of Disney, Hanna-Barbera and
Warner Bros. Entertainment.
Pixar was busy proving its potency within the realm of
a-D technology, Nickelodeon was enjoyingthe fruition of
its first few multimedia ventures and Cartoon Network
had just introduced its Adult Swim lineup, an adult-orib
ented complement to its popular action-animation block,
Toonami, already in full swing at the time.
Now, little over a decade after animation's turn-of-
the-century takeoff, its stereotype as either Disney clas-
sic or cheap children's entertainment has finally fallen
away to reveal new dodrways for animators at every skill
level. Though the University doesn't have an animation
program of its own, the sheer versatility of the genre -
combined with the increasing accessibility of classes and
equipment - helps students employ hard work and cre-
ative initiative to transform their animation aspirations
from conceptual artto reality.
Storytelling in the second dimension
Animators today have countless paths to choose from
that lead into what is now an estimated $80-billion indus-
try - the genre is used as a vehicle for everything from
entertainment and advertising to medical modeling and
teaching aids.
Even animation's traditional TV demographic has
shifted: The success of Comedy Central's "South Park,"
FX's "Archer" and FOX's "Family Guy" have proven that
animation can thrive outside of cartoon-heavy channels,
offering endless possibilities for those willing to think
outside the box - a crucial mindset for animation-bound
University students.
Because the University doesn't maintain a formal ani-
mation program or major, students interested in pursuing
the field are encouraged to create their own informal cur-
riculum, complete with classroom and extracurricular
experience.
The Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design and LSA's
Screen Arts & Cultures department provide hands-on
learning experiences that introduce students to the his-
tory, science and art of 2-D and 3-D animation. Classes
range from lectures on animation's political and social
contexts to individualized, project-centered design
courses, while SAC honors theses and independent stu-
dent projects offer opportunities for self-directed discov-
ery.
Options like these are not meant to be exclusive to
those starting out with an intimate knowledge of the
field. As daunting as jumping into animation may seem
to new students, University faculty and staff are aware
that most undergraduates likely have little to no prior
experience with animation, and help design their courses
accordingly.
"The very first project students do is make a flip book,
so they can actually see how much work goes into doing
something that takes about five seconds to watch," said
SAC professor Chris McNamara.
Among others, McNamara has taught introductory
courses on 2-D animation and new media, which enable
students to explore the methods and mechanics behind
the illustrated illusion of movement. Instead of focusing

on a single facet-of design or application, students are
introduced to a wide range of animation genres, from
hand-drawn sequences to stop-motion video, as well as
some of the abstract artistic elements that govern them.
"We have kind of a unique arrangement where students
do both productions and studies in the department," he
said. "So the concentration gives them a lot of conceptual
and theoretical background, as well as the foundational
aspects that deal with production."
Introductory SAC courses typically refrain from
delving into the advanced specifics of any single form
of digital or physical animation. But it's their broad and
inclusive nature - combined with the encouragement of
students to pursue their own short and long-term project
goals - which make them so enticing to curious first-tim-
ers and those for whom animation seems like a promising
career path.
"From my own experience, it's been pretty laissez-
faire in terms of what style you're taught (in SAC)," said
LSA senior Mike Chenoweth. "They're pretty inclined
to let you develop your own techniques, whatever they
may be. They'll teach you how to use the technology to
make actual animation, and other than that, the advice
they give you on your artwork is more based in technical
criticism."
In some SAC classes, students are given time for indi-
vidualized projects, or encouraged to start small ones of
their own. Whether it's an animation-based honors thesis
or a personal work-in-progress, these animators-in-the-
making are encouraged to get creative when looking to
enrich their skills outside the classroom.
"The mostehelpful thing is to just go out and do it," Che-
noweth said. "Even though there's not an intensive pro-
gram specifically devoted to the art of animation, there
are still projects floating around and people that need
animators."
"Since there's not that much in the way of course mate-
rial offered here, you have to take more of a hands-on
approach, and you really learn more about the craft when
you just do your own projects or work with other people,"
he added.
This technical introduction to the field leaves students
open to explore their own narrative ends and new media
interpretations and gain a scope of the field before choos-
ing to pursue a more specialized niche in the ever-grow-
ing animation spectrum.
"By no means do I think of these courses as compre-
hensively preparing students to become an animator,"
McNamara said. "But it certainly gives them an intro-
ductory taste of what it would take to pursue that kind
of work. In many ways I'm helping students to be more
prepared for independent work, and for the possibility
of incorporating animation elements into other kinds of
media."
Processing the power of pipeline
For students seeking to add another dimension to their
artistic repertoire, the Art & Design School offers a small
but int- .sive set of courses on the process of 3-D anima-
tion and modeling. This includes a semester-long pipeline
animation class and a digital modelingcourses that enter-
tainment-bound animators are encouraged to explore.
Art & Design junior Molly Lester is currently enrolled
in a pipeline animation class, which treats students as
a comprehensive animation team. A semester is spent
working toward the completion of a short animation
piece - one which will eventually be submitted to the
international SIGGRAPH Computer Animation Festival,
held yearly during the prestigious SIGGRAPH Interna-

In her novel, "Interview with
the Vampire," author Anne Rice
offers her readers an insight-
ful interview with a Romanian
vampire who struggled through
his childhood in the now-famous
Transylvanian region.
As Joseph, the vampire in
question, describes it, "Growing
up, I wouldn't see my parents for
days on end. Norman and Emma.
were both older than me, and
had mastered the skills needed to
be ordinary vampires.. And then
there was me, alone and forlorn
in a world where I didn't belong."
As Rice delves further into

Joseph's past, the vampire sup-
plies readers with memoirs rich
in emotion and realism that
force readers to reconsider the
blood-thirsty -stereotype given
to vampires.
Rice's reactions to these
memoirs complements the
authenticity of Joseph's past.
Her questions about the vam-
pire's childhood and his life as
a creature of the underworld,
trapped between the world
he's born in and the world he is
forced to live in, gives the life of
vampires a legitimacy that past
fictional works have lacked.

tional Conference and Exhibition
on Computer Graphics and Inter-
national Techniques.
"Last year this (class) was
actually a club," Lester said.
"But they couldn't get enough
lab time. So they decided to
petition it for a class, and it got
through, and now everything's
completely new for us."
The resulting course is the
first of its kind at the University,
and their festival submission
will be the University's first in
what is considered a profession-
al-grade animation competition.
Since the animation pipeline
process depends on the comple-
tion of many specialized jobs,
the creation of their short offers
a multitude of challenges for
students who must quickly learn
new skills and take on multiple
steps in the 3-D animation pro-
cess.
Lester said that though the
process of 3-D animation itself is
difficult - especially the learn-
ing curve for the software they
use - it's actually the process
of large-group communication
that offers the most potential for
problems.
But for Lester, the benefits of
group dynamics outweigh the
weekly difficulties. Making a
single piece of animation forces
each member of the group to see
their work in the greater context
of the narrative and its painstak-
ingly constructed setting.
"Originally, when they told
 me this story, I had a completely
different mental image of what
it was going to look like," Lester
said. "But the more and more we
do it, the more and more I get
used to the idea that my work
has to look like everyone else's,
since it has to fit in with this uni-
verse."
Though introductory anima-
tion classes tackle 2-D animation
and processes like Claymation,
it's the staggering capabilities
of the Duderstadt Center's lit-
tle-known technological gems,
such as the 3-D lab and the
various multimedia workrooms

scattered around the building,
which aid students in develop-
ing career-applicable modeling,
editing and motion-application
skills.
"We actually have a lot of
equipment for 3-D animation,"
said Lester. "We even have
motion-capture equipment. The
Dude is really set up to have the
processing power for you to do
a lot of really extreme digital
work. It's like a little goldmine
that no one really knows about."
With so much advanced hard-
ware and software available for
its students, the Art & Design
School's North Campus resourc-
es have the department primed
for any potential future expan-
sion of their animation cur-
riculum - or even a full-fledged
animation program.of its own.
"It seems like they should
have more focus-based anima-
tion classes," Lester said. "Or
more focused product-design
classes. But our school is so open
and broad that basically you
pick a teacher that youslike, you
pick a type of class that you like
and you pretty much stick with
them."
And despite the many dif-
ficulties that come with a sud-
den immersion in something as
technologically and creatively
demanding as 3-D animation,
Lester said their hard work
always seems to have a way of
paying off.
"I love what I'm doing because
I love the outcome," she said.
"When I see something that
I modeled, and it looks really
good, and I know I put all that
time and effort into it, it's like
a little piece of pride for me. So
no matter how frustrated I get
about pulling all-nighters for it,
I still love it."
Finding the "I" in animation
Not every animator chooses
to go the route of large-scale
group collaboration - and not
every project's success depends
on access to a stockpile of indus-
trial-strength rendering equip-
ment.
One of the most important
turn-of-the-century innovations

for aspiring animation students
was the introduction of acces-
sible software that could keep
up with demands of a creator's
imagination, making small-
group and independent work a
new norm for people from dif-
ferent backgrounds.
"I'm actually an English
major, and my original interest
was in creative writing," said
LSA senior TajRoy Duane Cal-
houn. "From there I got into the
graphic narrative and started
focusing on animation. I really
like storytelling in general, so I
would eventually like to get to a
point where I write my own nar-
rative stories, but right now I'm
focusing more on developing the
actual craft first."
Calhoun's English back-
ground is an important con-
tributing factor to the way he
approaches animation inside
and outside his SAC anima-
tion classes. Instead of being
employed solely for entertain-
ment purposes, it serves as an
alternate narrative vehicle for
otherwise non-visual stories.
And though his interests lie
mainly in the style and execu-
tion of Japanese animation, his
narrative specialty lies much
closer to home.
"My main goal is to become
my own storyteller through ani-
mation," he said. "As an English
Language and Literature major,
my focus is on 1950s African-
American literature, black exis-
tentialism and social realism,
and those are the kind of stories
that I'd want to tell as an anima-
tor. So in terms of my narratives,
I'd still want to focus on some-
thing about life in America and
being American."
The University's open-foun-
dation approach to teaching ani-
mation, especially within SAC,
has the added benefit of encour-
aging cross-disciplinary learn-
ing. Students can connect with a
more visual method of storytell-
ing through their varied majors
and interests.
Since animation's background
is as diverse as the people that
employ it - part storytelling
method, part artistic endeavor
and part social phenomenon -

the vast variation of its creative
sources leaves it especially open
to academic and extracurricu-
lar integration. Even without a
structured animation curricu-
lum, this malleability allows stu-
dents to choose a personal focus
within the interests they already
enjoy.
"Speaking critically, I think
the most difficult aspect of ani-
mation might be the rhythm and
the tempo," Calhoun said. "The
thing I actually have the most
difficulty with is anatomy, but
I do dance, I did poetry, and I
did some hip-hop and a little bit
of music production, so I like to
think that they've given me a
good sense of this rhythm."
Crafting a creative future
No matter their background
or style, students look to find
new and innovative ways to
utilize animation as a form of
personal expression and collab-
orative entertainment.
"You never know where stu-
dents are going to end up,"
McNamara said. "I think there's
a lot of activity in the indepen-
dent animation world that has
little to do with the studio con-
ventions. Ifa student is interest-
ing in pursuing that, I give them
all the guidance I can as their
instructor."
"There are some who work on
their projects independently and
submit them to festivals, and
then maybe have day jobs doing
animation or special . effects,
or perhaps design or editing
or post-production. There are
many different ways of thinking
about how animation could fit
into your career," he added.
Above all, students are
encouraged to keep an open
mind about the possibilities the
field can offer them, even after
leaving the University - espe-
cially in places and ways they
might not expect. And with the
millennial advent of the Inter-
net, advancements in technol-
ogy and the rising popularity
of independent studios, it's now
easier than ever for students to
take the future of animation into
their own hands.

STOP AND SMELL THE ROSES
Exploring the Arb for 36 hours

Qudditch, birds and
fairies populate the
A2 getaway
By JEFF WARANIAK
DailyArts Writer
Near the corner of West Ann
Street and North Main Street,
there's a blue-and-yellow window
sign. "Welcome to Ann Arbor, the
biggest little city in the middle," it
reads. It may not be the city's most
popular nickname, but it's accu-
rate. Ann Arbor is by no means
big, but with its own train sta-
tion, helipad, bus system and one
very big house, the "little city" of
Ann Arbor can occasionally feel
big. Luckily, for those occasions,
there'sthe Nichols Arboretum.
Day1I
7:30 a.m. Sunrise: You may
still be sleeping, but Ann Arbor
is wide awake. The early morn-
ing dog-walkers, joggers and
maintenance workers are already
halfway through their day by the
time you're scrambling to get to
your 10 a.m. sociology lecture.
For once, for no other reason than
to remember what the morning
looks like, join the early risers.
Take coffee, donuts or cider and
stroll throughthe iron gates of the
Arb's entrance off Geddes Avenue.
Go straight until you reach an
overlook with two wooden bench-
es, The Deborah Gimbel Memo-
rial Overlook. Watch the sky turn
from gray to pink to blue over a
distant North Campus bell tower.
11:30 a.m. Nature Walk: Con-
tinuing your early morning excur-
sion,walkdownthroughthe Arb's
Main Valley, past the caretaker's
cottage and into the thickest sec-
tion of the forest. To getthere, fol-
low the main road until you reach
a path marked only by two trash-
cans and a stone bench. From
here, hike up a hill and expect
to see animals. Look for hawks

Nichols Arboretum offers the opportunity for hours of entertainment and is open from sunrise to sunset.

spiraling around tree trunks to
snatch chipmunks and squirrels.
Watch for deer sparring head to
head on hillsides, their two-point-
ed antlers crackingtogether above
their skulls. The Arb is your very
own episode of "Planet Earth" -
justremembertobrushup onyour
David Attenborough impression.
2p.m.Fairy Woods:It shouldn't
be a surprise that the first pro-
duction of the Shakespeare in the
Arb series (ongoing since 2001)
was a retelling ofithe Bard's fairy-
and-forest-filled play, "A Mid-
summer Night's Dream." After
all, in addition to the animals
that live there, the Arb is home
to a sizeable population of fairies.
Near the Washington Heights
entrance, just past the Peony
Gardens, lies a small stand of
pine trees known as Fairy Woods
and Troll Hollow. Here you can
build a home of twigs, leaves and
pinecones for the unseen sprites
that call the Arb home. If you
think you're too old to be doing
these types of things, or some-
how above it all, that's fine. There
are plenty of heartless jerks in the
world with no imagination, and
you can be one, too.
5 p.m. The Golden Hour Run:
The evening hours of the Arb are

best reserved for exercise. Miles
of trails wind through the forest,
along the Huron River and into
the Alex Dow Prairie - an enor-
mous meadow of tall grasses and
plants that stretch to the Arb's
eastern border. If you are a long-
distance jogger or adventurous
traveler, cross the railroad tracks
near the end of the prairie. Next,
pass through a gap in the fence to
hook up with a cement path that
leads to Gallup Park and other city
parks.
10 p.m. Star Gazing: The Arb
is open from sunrise to sunset,
but stick around after the sun has
gone down and the tree limbs will
start looking like something from
a Tim Burton movie - and you're
likely to experience the Arb at its
quietest. Bring a blanket, a flash-
light and maybe a little romance
with you to the Main Valley,
where you can look up at the stars.
It may not be the night sky over
the Sahara, but. constellations,
planets, satellites and shooting
stars can still be spotted overhead
on a cloudless night.
2 a.m. Late Night: After a long
night of partying, particularly for
residents of Mary Markley Resi-
dence Hall and Oxford Houses,
the traditional sunset closure

doesn't apply. Return to the Arb
to wind down, to savor the glow
of a wild night, to have the mid-
night college conversations that
will never be forgotten. Just keep
in mind that the closed at sunset
rule actually does apply, regard-
less of how much "legal" fun
you're having.
Day2
8 a.m. Bird Watching: The Arb
is a treat for birders. If you've ever
felt the urge to put a name to the
birds you see and hear around
campus, chances are a birder can
help. Every Thursday at 8:00 a.m.
throughout October, a group of
amateur and seasoned birders
from the Washtenaw Audubon
Society gathers at the eastern end
of the Alex Dow Prairie. Here,
the group begins its weekly fall
migration walk. Take a stroll with
these friendly folks for a chance
to spot chickadees, wrens, jays,
woodpeckers and hawks. Walks
typically last until 11:00 a.m., but
all are welcome to come and go as
they please.
12p.m. Rocks in the River: There
are sites in Ann Arbor that have
patron saints. The corner of East
Liberty Street and Main Street

has the Violin Monster; the Sha=
piro Undergraduate Library has
the Washboard Man; and the Arb
has Mike Kelly. For decades, Kelly
has been rearranging rocks in the
Huron River at the Arb's River-
front Landing into what he calls,
"the heart of Jesus," according
to a previous Daily interview. On .
warm afternoons, you might spot
Kellywadingthroughthe waterin
long pants, tossing rocks aside to
create this arching formation. It
may not be your place to help con-
tribute to Kelly's rock formation,
but he's often willing to chat with
passersby.
1 p.m. Quidditch Match: Ah, the
fall. Colorful leaves,. cider mills,
pumpkins and ... Quidditch? Yes.
Come autumn, it's time to don
your striped scarf, recall your
quaffles and bludgers and attend
a University Quidditch match at
the team's home field in the Arb's
Main Valley. The team holds prac-
tices on weekdays and faces off
against intercollegiate teams on
Sundays - the University plays
Michigan State University this
Sunday, Oct. 21 at 1 p.m. It's a sure
way to get into the competitive
spirit and to enjoy yet another
autumn afternoon in the Nichols
Arboretum.

celebs are just mating within
the 2 percent because that's how
relationships work. Connec-

people in the same environment
simply because that is fate's way
of bringing them together. And
maybe that's why a Hollywood
