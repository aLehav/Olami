When Ari Paul, a University 
of 
Michigan 
alum, 
met 
his 
aunt’s husband William “Buzz” 
Alexander as a teenager, he 
recognized how special Alexander 
was right away.
“Meeting him for the first time, 
you could tell he was someone of 
incredible experience and had an 
endless love of people,” Ari said. 
Janie Paul, Alexander’s wife 
and a School of Art & Design 
professor, met her husband in 1992 
at the Blue Mountain Center, a 
community of writers and artists 
upstate New York. They became 
inseparable, she said.
“He just exuded a feeling of 
interest in other people,” Janie 
said. “The first thing I noticed was 
that he was a great listener.”
The English professor and 
creator of the Prison Creative Arts 
Project passed away at his home 
in Ann Arbor on Sept. 19. He died 
of complications from frontal 
temporal degeneration at the age 
of 80, Janie said. 
Alexander was born in Chicago 
and raised in Wilmette, Illinois. 
He received his undergraduate 

degree from Harvard University 
in 1960 and returned as an 
instructor in 1967. While there, 
he joined the Anti-Vietnam War 
movement, putting him on the 
path of social justice advocacy. He 
moved to Ann Arbor to teach at 
the University of Michigan in 1971, 
where he taught until 2017. 
He 
led 
many 
activist 
movements on campus, including 
“The Committee for Human 
Rights in Latin America.” He also 
pioneered 
anti-racist 
activites 
among 
University 
faculty, 
co-founding 
the 
Concerned 
Faculty organization in 1987. His 
push to require English majors 
to take classes about literature 
written by women and people of 
color led to the creation of the LSA 
Race and Ethnicity requirement, 
according to Janie. 
“I’ll always remember Buzz for 
the soft-spoken pedagogical and 
political radicalism that allowed 
him to bridge generation gaps,” 
wrote English professor Alan Wald 
in an email to the department. “His 
success as a classroom teacher and 
pioneer in the development of new 
courses could send one into envy 
meltdown.”

Political 
cable 
network 
C-SPAN 
stopped 
outside 
Rackham Graduate School as 
part of its educational bus tour 
Monday. The high-tech bus 
acted as a mobile classroom and 
has been on tour since 1993 to 
engage with voters and elected 
officials.
C-SPAN 
marketing 
representative Jenae Green said 
the bus is stopping in various 
cities in Michigan and several 

other Midwest states for its 
battleground 
states 
tour 
in 
preparation for the upcoming 
2020 presidential election.
“Michigan plays a huge role 
in the election, it always does,” 
Green said. “We wanted to 
make sure that we come by 
the University of Michigan to 
engage with students, professors 
and just talk about politics, 
and in an unbiased way — an 
unfiltered way of letting you 
see what’s happening, and the 
candidates that are running 
what’s going on in government. 

And then just finding out more 
ways to stay informed.”
Green said what separates 
C-SPAN 
from 
most 
other 
news outlets is its unbiased 
and nonpartisan reporting on 
government affairs, since it was 
created by the cable industry 
as a public service. C-SPAN 
receives no funding from the 
government.
“We can truly make sure that 
we keep our coverage unbiased, 
nonpartisan, because we don’t 
have to lean one way or the 
other,” Green said. “In the way 

that we show news, we don’t 
ever have a panel discussing 
what’s going on behind them … 
so the viewers at home can make 
it their own informed decision.”
Doug Hemmig, a C-SPAN 
community 
relations 
representative who’s traveling 
with the bus, said the bus acts 
as both a classroom and a studio 
with 11 large-screen tablets, 
a smart board for classroom 
teaching, a photo station and 
a TV production studio for 
programming.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Washtenaw County’s Judge 
Carol Kuhnke ruled Wednesday 
to allow residents access to 
records 
of 
communication 
between private citizens and 
city officials under the Freedom 
of Information Act. In doing 
so, 
Kuhnke 
ruled 
in 
favor 
of Ann Arbor resident Luis 
Vazquez 
whose 
April 
FOIA 
requested, among other things, 
any interaction between city 

councilmembers and Ann Arbor 
resident Pat Lesko over email, 
texting or social media direct 
messaging since Jan. 1, 2019.
Vazquez said his interest 
was piqued through a personal 
distrust of Lesko. Lesko has been 
named by many as an active 
participant in Ann Arbor politics, 
even running for mayor almost a 
decade ago. Vazquez called her 
“Machiavellian” and said she 
often wrote or spoke poorly about 
her adversaries in the media. 
“I was just curious as to how 

things were going to be with a 
new majority on council, which 
she obviously helped to elect,” 
Vazquez said.
He and others also pointed out 
the frequency with which Lesko 
requests FOIAs herself.
“Those who want to find out 
information 
about 
everybody 
else should be prepared to reveal 
information about themselves,” 
Vazquez said.
Vazquez’s FOIA also asked for 
communication between resident 
Tom Stulberg and attorney Tom 

Wieder with any public official 
over the same period, as well as 
communication between council 
members Anne Bannister, Jeff 
Hayner, 
Jack 
Eaton, 
Kathy 
Griswold and Elizabeth Nelson 
who, 
according 
to 
Vazquez, 
constitute a new majority in 
the city council whose views 
and actions stand in contrast 
to his own interests and shared 
the political support of Lesko, 
Stulberg and Weider.

Eleven 
SACUA 
board 
members 
held 
their 
weekly 
meeting 
Monday 
afternoon in the Fleming 
Administration 
Building, 
addressing 
issues 
facing 
the University of Michigan 
faculty and student body. 
University President Mark 
Schlissel was in attendance 
for the first half hour of the 
session, speaking on issues 
of curbing vape use and 
improving parking at the 
University.
Schlissel said the issue 
of vaping has been on his 
radar 
for 
several 
years, 
and 
administrators 
have, 
on 
several 
occasions, 
considered crafting a ban 
on 
tobacco 
products 
on 
campus.
“A year or two ago, Preeti 
Malani, who’s our Chief 
Health Officer from the 
health system who has this 
advisory role to me, said, 
‘You know, Mark, we should 
really consider making the 
campus not just no smoking, 
but tobacco free,’” Schlissel 
said. 
“And 
by 
common 
usage, vaping falls under 
tobacco, be that as it may.”

The House of Representatives 
passed the Secure And Fair 
Enforcement 
Banking 
Act 
on Sept. 25, to protect and 
facilitate 
relationships 
for 
banking organizations looking 
to work with legitimate cannabis 
businesses. 
After 
struggling 
with maintaining relationships 
with banks for years, Ann Arbor 
cannabis 
dispensaries 
believe 
the bill could drastically benefit 
business and destigmatize the 
cannabis industry as a whole.
The main purpose of the bill 
is to prevent federal banking 
regulators 
from 
“penalizing 
a 
depository 
institution 
for 
providing banking services” to 
cannabis companies for the sole 
reason that these businesses 
handle 
cannabis. 
Specifically, 
these regulators are prohibited 
from taking adverse action on a 
loan made to these businesses, 
discriminating 
banks 
and 
credit unions for collecting or 
processing payments for these 
businesses and ending or limiting 
the 
dispensary’s 
insurance, 
among other restrictions. 
The bill must now be passed 
by the Senate and signed by the 
President of the United States in 
order to be enacted into law.

Michigan’s Global CO2 Initiative

On April 11th of this year, the University of Michigan’s Global CO2 Initiative met for the first time, hosting a two-day workshop on developing CO2-based products. The 
initiative aims to create solutions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create carbon negative technologies, while gauging public interest in the new technologies. 
Some of the solutions include: 

U-M scientists are developing 
ways to convert carbon into 
Polyurethene and 
Polycarbonate materials.

U-M researchers are working to 
convert excess carbon into micro 
and macro-algae fuels.

Technologies are being created 
to use carbon to create cement, 
asphalt, and super hardwood for 
construction purposes.

Carbon into Materials: 
Carbon into Concrete: 
Carbon into Fuels 
and Chemicals: 
The central goal of the initiative 
is to create solutions that boost 
the economy without harming 
the environment.

Senior Social Media Editor: Allie Phillips 

Alexander began working with 
prisoners in the state of Michigan 
in 1990, according to PCAP’s tribute 
on their website. He conducted 
his first theater workshop at the 
Florence 
Crane 
Correctional 
Facility, which led him to create his 
Theater and Social Change class, 
Janie said. This became PCAP, a 
program which brings volunteers 
from the University into prisons 
to lead art education workshops, 
including creative writing, theater, 
painting and more. 
Today, PCAP has an expansive 
reach, with volunteers entering 
27 adult correctional facilities, 
several youth facilities, the Forensic 
Psychiatric Center and a public 
housing community each year. The 
program grew from Alexander’s 
determination to give incarcerated 
people the opportunity to learn, 
PCAP Associate Director Vanessa 
Mayesky said. 
“Buzz was really bringing up 
this issue and demanding that 
people talk about it and think about 
it, and really think about the people 

inside prisons as people, not as 
mere problems to be swept under 
the rug or perpetrators of crime,” 
Mayesky said. 
One of PCAP’s most notable 
programs is the Annual Exhibition 
of Art by Michigan Prisoners, 
which 
Janie 
and 
Alexander 
created in 1996. Ari said he vividly 
remembers his uncle driving to 
numerous prisons in Michigan over 
spring break to collect prisoners’ 
art. 
“Buzz would get in a pickup 
truck on his week off, and he would 
drive to correctional facilities all 
around Michigan, this huge state 
in the middle of February in the 
coldest darkest time of the year, 
when he could have very easily 
gone south to someplace warm, 
could kick back and relax,” Ari 
said. “He could have read books, 
he could have done anything. But 
this was his calling, and he sort of 
had this feeling that because these 
people are behind bars, if he didn’t 
do this, no one else would.”
Stephen Hartnett, editor of 
“Challenging the Prison-Industrial 
Complex: 
Activism, 
Arts 
and 
Educational 
Alternatives,” 
said 
people in the prison education field 

looked up to Buzz. 
“I think for most of us who 
worked with him, not only was he a 
mentor and a positive example, but 
he was really kind of like a spiritual 
example,” Hartnett said. “I mean, 
all of us wanted to be more like 
Buzz.”
Through PCAP and his classes, 
Alexander inspired thousands of 
students. Mayesky was one of those 
students, and said many alumni 
have been emailing about how 
Alexander forever changed their 
lives. 
“Many of us have been writing 
and talking about how Buzz 
changed the course of our lives, and 
how we would not be the people we 
are today or doing the work that we 
do if it weren’t for his teaching, if it 
weren’t for his example, if it weren’t 
for the questions he asked us,” 
Mayesky said. 
Sara 
Falls, 
a 
high 
school 
English teacher in California, took 
Alexander’s “What is Literature?” 
and “Theater and Social Change” 
classes at the University, the latter 
involving improvisational theater 
in prisons. Alexander’s readings 
and discussions on prison justice 
got her thinking more deeply about 
how the education system can 
create a pipeline to prison, 
eventually compelling her to 
become a teacher herself. 
“He started to get me to 
think about what it means to 
be a teacher,” Falls said. “This 
is my 20th year teaching, and 
I don’t think I’d be a teacher if 
it wasn’t for him. It’s my life’s 
work, and I feel deeply called 
to it, because it’s about finding 
the power in young people and 
helping them to use their voices 
and helping them feel powerful 
in themselves to make change.”
Melissa Palma, director of 
curriculum 
and 
instruction 
at Network Charter School 
in Oregon, became deeply 
involved 
with 
PCAP 
for 
six years while getting her 
teaching 
certificate 
at 
the 
University. She had taken a 
class with Alexander her senior 
year, where she said Alexander 
asked students to consider their 
place in a system with a prison-
industrial complex. Palma said 
though this was uncomfortable, 
it was important in pushing 
students to learn. 
“He would always make it 

go back to like, ‘What’s your part 
in this? What’s your place? How 
do you contribute to it or dismantle 
this?’” Palma said. “He was always 
asking us to personalize the 
political really, and it was really 
uncomfortable many times, and 
students would be upset or crying 
sometimes, but from, like, a very 
vulnerable and safe space.”
David 
Enders, 
a 
freelance 
journalist, said he recalled moments 
in Alexander’s class where students 
had powerful realizations about 
themselves and the privileges they 
had.
“I remember more students kind 
of having these ‘aha’ moments, 
in Buzz’s courses than, like, any 
other professor I had at Michigan,” 
Enders said. 
Alexander 
inspired 
Emily 
Harris, who works at the Ella 
Baker Center for Human Rights 
in California, to pursue a career in 
criminal justice and prison reform.
“PCAP and Buzz and his ability 
to see what I was capable of has 
pushed me to spend my life to get 
people free,” Harris said. “It’s really 
the most profound work, and I am 
so lucky that my path intersected 
with him and has given me a deep 
level of meaning.”
Alexander’s efforts weren’t only 
meant for student growth, however. 
Through his workshops, he uplifted 
thousands of Michigan prisoners. 
Danny Valentine, an artist who 
worked with Janie and Alexander 
while still in prison, said Alexander 
saved his life. 
When 
Alexander 
entered 
Valentine’s life, he was serving out 
a 30-year sentence and could not 
afford an attorney, Valentine said.
“I had made plans to kill myself,” 
Valentine said. “I was going to 
make my move when they called 
the evening meal. But they passed 
out mail right before evening chow. 
I got this letter from this guy called 
Buzz Alexander.”
Alexander wrote that he’d heard 
Valentine was an artist, and asked 
if he wanted to participate in an art 
show he was putting on. Valentine 
said he participated in the art show 
for 20 years, each year giving him 
an incentive to stay alive, as well 
as giving him an income. When 
he eventually got out of prison, 
Alexander brought him to his home 
and fed him blueberry pancakes.

Though marijuana has been 
legalized in one form or another in 
47 states and Washington D.C., it is 
not legal at the federal level. Thus, 
many depository institutions have 
been reluctant to engage in business 
with the cannabis industry for fear 
of getting penalized by the federal 
government. This has prevented 
many 
marijuana 
businesses, 
including those in Ann Arbor, from 
having strong relationships with 
banks.
For instance, Om of Medicine, 
a cannabis provisioning center 
in Ann Arbor, has gone through 
10 bank accounts in its 10 years 
of operation, according to Lisa 
Conine, Om Community Outreach 
Coordinator. 
“As you can imagine, that’s 
pretty stressful for business,” 
Conine said. “Essentially, it’s on the 
banks for how they want to handle 
cannabis businesses, and as of 
right now, because they don’t have 
any federal protection, they don’t 
really want to deal with cannabis 
businesses because it puts them at 
risk.”
Conine said a lot of the banks 
have a system that is triggered if 
something they deem out of the 
ordinary occurs, such as a large 
cash deposit. Based on their own 
discretion, these banks can then 
decide to freeze the account of 
a marijuana business and then 
eventually 
close 
the 
account 
altogether. 
“A lot of times, we don’t really 
even know the bank’s process until 
it’s already happened, and every 
bank might have a different thing 
that triggers it, so it’s really like 
a guessing game,” Conine said. 
“So, it’s super inconvenient and 
obviously a huge issue when that 
just randomly happens, and then 
things like rent and electricity 
that any business has to pay, we 
struggle to do if, all of a sudden, our 
account shuts down and all those 
automatic payments are trying to 
be taken out.”
Conine 
said 
if 
the 
SAFE 
Banking Act were to pass through 
Congress, Om would feel much 
more financially secure when 
conducting business.
“So, for us, the most instant 
benefit of the bill would be if we 
had a bank account that we didn’t 
have to worry about shutting 
down, and we could process 
everything through and act like 
any other business and not have to 
worry,” Conine said.
Another obstacle Om has faced 

due to its adverse relations with 
banks is difficulty in trying to 
provide donations. Om supports 
local Ann Arbor nonprofits, and 
several 
times 
after 
donating 
checks to these organizations, a 
bank has shut down Om’s account 
without the business’s knowledge 
and before the nonprofit could 
process the donation. Om then 
has to explain the situation 
to the nonprofits and create a 
new way to transfer the money, 
making the process unnecessarily 
complicated, according to Conine.
The difficulties these businesses 
experience 
with 
depository 
institutions also result in a lack 
of ability for the companies to 
take credit cards, debit cards 
and checks from patients. Thus, 
patients and customers must pay 
with cash when going to most 
cannabis businesses.
Nationwide, the knowledge of 
marijuana businesses solely using 
cash has resulted in a fear and 
increased likelihood of theft and 
robbery. For instance, TotaLeaf 
Inc, a cannabis manufacturing 
company 
in 
Sacramento, 
California, had $80,000 worth 
of product and cash stolen from 
its warehouse this past year. In 
addition, on Aug. 28, there was 
an armed robbery at a marijuana 
social club in Genesee Township, 
Michigan.
State 
Rep. 
Debbie 
Dingell, 
D-Ann Arbor, expressed in a 
tweet the security issues of 
these 
marijuana 
dispensaries 
handling business in cash and the 
importance of shifting to other 
payment methods.
“It is not safe to walk around 
with duffel bags full of cash – but 
that’s what’s happening right 
now,” Dingell wrote. “Marijuana is 
already legal in many states. Now 
let’s make it safe for legitimate 
marijuana businesses to use banks 
like other legitimate businesses.”
Another difficult aspect of only 
being able to conduct business in 
cash is the negative stigma that 
often results from it. According to 
Conine, solely using cash makes 
many people feel like they are 
operating in the illicit market. 
Many patients already come into 
the dispensary with a negative 
perception 
associated 
with 
cannabis, and having them carry 
and pay large sums of money adds 
to this mindset. 
“So 
really 
being 
able 
to 
normalize it and make it just like 
any other purchase that they 
make anywhere else is something 
subtle but can have a big impact on 
the subconscious in the way that 
people can start to dismantle that 

stigma and the shame that might 
be associated with cannabis use,” 
she said. “Especially when they’re 
trying to heal an illness, you don’t 
want to be using something and 
feel like you’re a criminal doing 
it; that’s not helpful when you’re 
trying to get better.”
If the bill were to pass and these 
cannabis businesses are able to 
build stronger relationships with 
depository institutions, patients 
would not only benefit, but the 
industry would as well, Conine 
said. At the moment, according 
to Conine, the system makes 
it difficult for small marijuana 
businesses looking to enter the 
market. 
“It’s 
an 
issue 
for 
small 
businesses because, if they’re 
not able to work with banks in a 
traditional way, then they can’t 
access normal business loans,” 
Conine said. “So, the access to 
capital is really important for 
people to succeed in the industry, 
so a lot of people, if they don’t have 
access to investors, they’re kind of 
counted out already.”
According to Eric TerBush, 
LSA senior and product manager 
and staff reporter at Benzinga 
Cannabis, the growth of the 
cannabis 
industry 
has 
been 
curtailed by the lack of protections 
currently present for depository 
institutions.
“I think the ability for the 
industry to mature is stifled by 
the inability to bank,” TerBush 
said. “An important clause within 
the SAFE Banking Act includes 
insurance protections as well as 
banking protections which can be 
interpreted as opening the doors to 
institutional investment, which is 
very much needed in an industry 
that’s incredibly cash-strapped and 
in constant demand for (external) 
financing.”
Conine described the value 
passing the bill would have on 
the industry as a whole and how 
it could increase the likelihood of 
other cannabis-related legislation 
getting passed as well.
“This is so important,” Conine 
said. “The whole movement is 
really looking at this banking 
issue as the first domino that 
needs to fall. If we can get this 
passed through Congress, then 
there’s so much more of a chance 
for other bills to pass because the 
conversation will be fresh, it’ll be 
live in everybody’s minds on the 
Hill and it’s a low hanging fruit. It’s 
not controversial at all, we’re just 
asking for these already existing 
businesses to be able to use a bank 
account.”

However, 
according 
to 
Schlissel, the scientific data 
has been insufficient for 
the University to introduce 
any campus-wide ban.
“What I was concerned 
about is there is not great 
data about the health effects 
of vaping,” Schlissel said. 
“If you have the stuff laced 
with CBD or something, 
then 
that’s 
a 
different 
beast, 
but 
commercial 
vaping things, it could be 
a pathway to addiction, 
but it’s also a prescribed 
treatment to get people off 
cigarettes.”
Vaping 
has 
become 
a 
particularly pertinent issue 
to University students after 
Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer 
banned sales of flavored 
e-cigarettes 
in 
early 
September. The new ban 
attempts to limit underage 
kids’ access to Juuls and 
other devices that are seen 
as a gateway to cigarettes 
and 
tobacco 
products. 
Earlier 
this 
month, 
the 
Trump 
administration 
enforced 
a 
similar 
policy, cracking down on 
e-cigarette 
companies 
marketing to children.
Schlissel 
said 
the 
University 
would 
not 
make a similar mandate 
due to problems with the 
enforceability of a potential 
ban of nicotine products on 
campus.

“These things are so tiny 
and discreet that it’s very 
hard to enforce a ban,” 
Schlissel said. “Who’s going 
to be the vaping police? And 
in your class, do you want to 

spend your time scanning 
every person and saying ‘Is 
that a piece of candy you’re 
popping in your mouth or 
are you taking a puff on 
some 
electronic 
device?’ 
And if you make these rules 
that aren’t enforceable, it 
kind of decreases respect 
for the law.”
Schlissel also referenced 
efforts to improve parking 
and 
transportation 
for 
U-M health center patients 
and nursing staff unable to 
make appointments due to 
parking. Schlissel said the 
University 
has 
proposed 
several 
projects 
which 
would make parking and 
transportation 
to 
North 
Campus easier.
“There’s a construction 
project for a thousand spots 
of parking right next to the 
Wall Street garage which 
is three minutes from the 
health system, so that will 
be very helpful,” Schlissel 
said.
Another 
possible 
proposed solution was a 
new shuttle that runs on 
its own path separate from 
the roadways that would 
decrease 
commute 
time. 
Schlissel said this project 
is still in the works, but 
could begin to be developed 
within the next few years.
“We’re 
working, 
but 
not 
ready 
for 
public 
consumption, on a high-
volume, 
high-speed 
connector, that will go from 
Central Campus, right in 
front of the health system, 
up to the North Campus and 
onto the NCRC,” Schlissel 
said. “It would have a high 
enough 
capacity 
and 
a 
regular enough frequency 
that it would help a lot.”
Schlissel 
said 
this 
proposal 
was 
crafted 
in response to frequent 
congestion 
and 
slow-
moving traffic on Fuller 
Street, leading to North 
Campus. This traffic largely 
affects University faculty 
who make the commute, 
either in their own car 
or via Blue Bus, to North 
Campus every day.
Another 
point 
of 
discussion 
for 
board 
members was the use of 
electronic voting for the 
Senate Assembly, a method 
that members say has been 
adopted by multiple other 
universities.

Ivo Dinov, SACUA board 
member and bioinformatics 
professor, 
wrote 
the 
report 
on 
introducing 
electronic voting to Senate 
Assembly, and said using 
this technology to gauge 
support for certain policies 
can eliminate complications 
involved with voting in 
person.
“If you only insist on 
having people that meet 
the 
minimum 
critical 
requirement, 
that 
100 
people — Senate members, 
show up to vote — is this a 
better situation than having 
everybody have a chance 
to vote even if they did not 
hear the argument?” Dinov 
said. “So it’s one of those 
things where you have to 
be careful because a lot of 
people travel, and they’re 
just not going to be here. 
So, having the opportunity 

to vote asynchronously is a 
huge plus.”
Director 
of 
U-M’s 
Faculty 
Senate 
Office, 
MaryJo 
Banasik, 
spoke 
with a Senate Assembly 
member at the University 
of Minnesota, who claimed 
that electronic voting has 
streamlined the process of 
making faculty decisions. 
Banasik said ideally the 
University would purchase 
software such as Qualtrics 
or Simply Voting to expedite 
the voting process.
“They 
actually 
use 
it 
[Simply 
Voting] 
if 
they 
cannot 
get 
a 
quorum,” 
Banasik 
said. 
“So, 
they 
have a deliberative meeting 
in person first to discuss 
the issues and the next 
meeting they hold the vote 
in person, and if they don’t 
have enough people to make 
the quorum for that vote, 
then they turn to electronic 
voting.”

At 
the 
University 
in 
particular, C-SPAN wanted to 
engage with students and first-
time voters to help them learn 
more about the government, 
elections and U.S. history, 
Hemming said.
“In 
the 
classroom, 
we 
bring 12 to 15 students on 
for a 15-minute presentation 
talking about our video library, 
which 
has 
over 
250,000 
hours of content, adding 
to it every day,” Hemming 
said. “So, they walk away 
with a new resource they 
can use inside and outside 
the classroom, not only as 
a first-time voter, but to 
learn about government, 
American 
history 
and 
civics.”
Green added that, with 
its onboard studio, C-SPAN 
can film live tapings and 
interviews to be aired in its 
programming. 
“We are doing 30-second 

interviews 
asking 
the 
question: 
‘What’s 
an 
issue that you want the 
candidates 
to 
address 
in 2020?’” she said. “So, 
what’s important to you. 
We air these on C-SPAN 
almost like commercials 
highlighting the University 
of Michigan students and 
staff here and the state of 
Michigan as a whole.”
Robert 
Krasny, 
a 
University 
professor 
of 
mathematics and a C-SPAN 
viewer, 
was 
excited 
to 
interact with the bus after 
hearing it was on campus. 
He agreed with Green, 
saying 
C-SPAN 
is 
an 
important public service.
“They say it right on the 
bus, it’s your unfiltered 
view of the government,” 
Krasny said. “The great 
thing about C-SPAN is that 
they’re 
balanced. 
They 
have call-in programs, for 
example. People can call 
in and give their opinion 
about 
the 
events 
that 
are going on. One phone 

number is for Democrats, 
one phone number is for 
Republicans, 
and 
the 
third phone number is for 
independents 
and 
they 
really get very balanced, 
round point of view of the 
whole population.”
LSA senior Pamela Sobze 
had heard of C-SPAN, but 
wanted to interact with 
the bus to learn more about 
them. Sobze said C-SPAN 
could help college students 
engage more with politics 
and 
the 
government 
through interactive events 
like its bus tour. 
“Young people, a lot of 
them do follow politics, 
but a lot of them don’t,” she 
said. “It’s hard to balance it 
with school, so I think this 
is a good way to get people 
exposed to it. And if there 
are things they don’t know, 
like I didn’t know a lot of 
the minor details, it’s fun 
to learn about why certain 
events are so important 
and why things get so much 
coverage.”

For the last three years 
of 
Alexander’s 
illness, 
Valentine became his full-
time 
caretaker. 
Valentine 
said it was an honor to 
help 
Alexander, 
after 
the 
compassion 
Alexander 
had 
shown him. 
“He 
fought 
for 
the 
underdog, he fought for the 
people that couldn’t fight for 
themselves, the people that 
didn’t get justice,” Valentine 
said. “There was something 
magical about him.”
Renardo A. Bowles, who is 
studying to be a social worker 
in 
Detroit, 
participated 
in Alexander’s drama and 
creative writing workshops 
while still in prison. Bowles 
said Alexander is the reason 
he decided to continue his 
education when he got out of 
prison in 2013.
“He gave me a different 
perspective and he impacted 
my life by wanting me to 

continue 
with 
education,” 
Bowles said. “Right now, I’m 
working with a lot of troubled 
youth, I’m working with the 
same people who have been 
in the same situation I was in 
… that, right there, inspired 
me to do more of that of 
giving back. That’s what he 
exemplified.”
Darryl 
Woods, 
whose 
prison 
sentence 
was 
commuted 
by 
former 
Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder 
last year, also felt Alexander’s 
influence through his PCAP 
workshops. 
Woods 
said 
a 
creative 
writing 
workshop 
improved his writing skills 
and helped him earn his GED. 
He also recalled Buzz’s ability 
to bring prisoners of different 
identities together, which was 
a rare occurrence according to 
Woods. 
“He brought us all together, 
we 
all 
came 
together 
to 
create,” Woods said. “That 
was a magical thing, that was 
a powerful thing to do inside 
the prison.”
In 
spite 
of 
his 
work 

delving into serious, systemic 
problems, 
Alexander 
had 
a silly side too, Janie said. 
Laughing, she told a story 
of Buzz entering a theater 
workshop dressed up as a 
woman. 
“He wore stockings, and 
high heels and a wig. And he 
was six-foot-four. And when 
he walked on stage, the women 
in the audience just collapsed 
with laughter,” Janie said. 
He loved hiking, biking and 
reading, Janie said. Woods 
said he would miss Alexander’s 
“infectious” laugh and smile. 
Other people interviewed for 
the story chuckled about his 
flyaway hair. Everyone felt his 
legacy would live on. 
Valentine 
said 
he’s 
hoping someone else in the 
community with Buzz’s magic 
appears.
“I just hope somebody else 
can carry the light the way he 
did,” Valentine said. “I mean, 
every once in awhile someone 
comes along, but we need 
people like that in our in our 
society and in our culture.”

Lesko 
did 
not 
respond 
to multiple requests for an 
interview, and Stulberg directed 
The Daily to Weider. Kuhnke’s 
office declined to comment for 
this story.
In response to the FOIA, 
Lesko, Stulberg and Weider sued 
to stop their records’ disclosure. 
Kuhnke stated in her ruling that 
because the messages in question 
concerned city business, they 
therefore constituted part of 
the public record and could be 
subject to FOIA.
However, 
Weider 
said 
he 
believed 
it 
was 
more 
complicated. Weider said he 

thought citizens should have 
the right to raise an issue with 
their public officials without fear 
that their neighbors may FOIA 
those communications and use it 
against them.
“There’s 
no 
reason 
that 
citizens can’t have confidential 
communications 
with 
people 
to the government,” Weider 
said. “In fact, there are good 
reasons why they should. … It 
could keep people from actually 
communicating with their own 
counsel people.”
Weider 
also 
said 
that 
according to his understanding 
of FOIA, the city does not 
have to release the records of 
communication between private 
citizens and public officials — 
they are allowed to do so, but the 
act does not compel that action. 

Weider said he and the others 
brought the suit against this 
FOIA hoping the judge would 
point this out in her ruling, but it 
was never referenced by Kuhnke.
“I don’t think any of the three 
of us really care very much about 
the substance that’s going to 
be damaging or embarrassing,” 
Weider said. “It’s just a matter of 
principle.”
City 
Attorney 
Stephen 
Postema has previously stated 
the 
city 
of 
Ann 
Arbor 
is 
compelled by statute to fulfill 
FOIAs of the nature of that filed 
by Vazquez.
Griswold and Nelson each 
said they believe the judge ruled 
correctly and the records of their 
communication 
with 
private 
citizens is applicable to FOIA 
regulation.

“I don’t want to be having 
secret 
conversations 
with 
anyone,” Griswold said.
Mayor 
Christopher 
Taylor 
said FOIA should function as a 
“window into the workings of 
government.” He said he does 
not get offended when people 
FOIA his records and others who 
wish to influence governmental 
proceedings should be prepared 
for the same scrutiny.
“It’s the right of every person 
to make such a request,” Taylor 
said.
However, 
Griswold 
and 
Nelson each voiced a concern 
that FOIA rules may be becoming 
more out of touch as technology 
evolves. 
Nelson 
noted 
that 
people who are not as active in 
Ann Arbor politics may not know 
how to take advantage of FOIA 

capabilities.
“For people who want to 
be informed, who want to be 
involved, we need to make it 
easier for them to understand 
how our government is working,” 
Nelson said.
Nelson also raised concerns 
regarding how this ruling will 
affect communication obtained 
through FOIA which revolve 
around 
campaigning, 
not 
governing. Griswold, likewise, 
indicated the only outcome she 
predicts this ruling will render 
will be an uptick in FOIAs 
coming election season.
The records have not yet been 
released and will remain sealed 
so as to allow the plaintiffs the 
opportunity to continue their 
case in the Michigan State Court 
of Appeals. Weider told The 

Daily he and the others will not 
be continuing with the case. 
Vazquez promised to publish the 
records as soon as they are made 
available to him.
However, Vazquez admitted 
he does not believe there to be 
any inflammatory information 
included 
in 
the 
documents 
obtained through FOIA. He too 
believes primarily in defending 
the principle of his position: the 
preservation of transparency.
“I’m 
not 
expecting 
any 
smoking 
guns 
or 
anything 
because if you look through the 
documents that were given to 
me, they’re all pretty tame,” 
Vazquez said. “But for Lesko, 
Stulberg and Weider to stand in 
the way of full disclosure tells 
me and many people they’ve got 
something to hide.”

U.S. complicity in Bahrain’s human rights abuses
W

hile 
the 
United 
States has stated its 
commitment to the 
advancement of human rights 
abroad for decades, the historical 
record often indicates otherwise. 
Nearly a year ago, the death of 
journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 
Saudi Arabia (which is widely 
believed to be the result of a 
Saudi-led 
operation) 
sparked 
plenty of political conversation 
about the United States’s foreign 
policy relationships with human 
rights violators. In particular, 
much has been written about the 
United States’s desire to continue 
providing military technology to 
Saudi Arabia in the wake of Saudi 
Arabian intervention in Yemen. 
The Saudi-led effort in Yemen 
has resulted in the bombing of 
schoolbuses and hospitals as 
well as the deaths of thousands 
of civilians, and the conflict has 
been prolonged by U.S. weapons 
funneling into Middle Eastern 
countries. While there is a 
limited ceasefire as of less than a 
week ago, the road to peace still 
looks long. The war has led to 
widespread famine and disease 
outbreaks, and the attacks have 
displaced many Yemen civilians. 
However, little attention has 
been paid to another country 
that the United States continues 
to 
arm 
despite 
horrendous 
human rights abuses: Bahrain. 
Much like Saudi Arabia, Bahrain 
is also arming belligerents in the 
Yemen civil war and using U.S. 
weapons to fight in the conflict. 
And much like Saudi Arabia, 
Bahrain’s domestic human rights 
record is anything but positive. 
The suppression of protests 
and free speech in Bahrain 
is a relatively new political 
development. 
During 
the 
Middle East’s wave of popular 
movements in the spring of 
2011, protests for democratic 
reform in Bahrain were quickly 
crushed by the Bahrain Defense 
Forces (along with some Saudi 
Arabian intervention assistance) 
in a way that has proven to be 
efficient as well as brutal. Since 
the end of protests in Bahrain, 
thousands 
of 
demonstrators 
have been jailed and tortured. 
In the past two years, Bahrain’s 

government has embarked on 
an extensive campaign to crack 
down on political opposition. 
Alongside the recent increase 
in imprisonment of citizens 
for tweeting about abuse, Shi’a 
clerics have also been targeted 
and stripped of their nationality.
The United States is not the 
only country that has funded 
Bahrain’s human rights abuses. 
In 2018, a report from The 
Guardian alleged the British 
government was funding the 
torture 
and 
executions 
of 
dissidents in Bahrain. Human 
rights 
organizations 
have 
accused the British government 

of being opaque about the 
purpose of the U.K.’s foreign 
aid toward Bahrain, and a 
spokesman from the British 
Foreign Office admitted as much. 
While 
many 
suggest 
the 
United States should cease its 
current military and economic 
support for Bahrain’s campaign 
against protesters and dissidents, 
it would also be beneficial to 
stipulate future U.S. aid on 
ensuring that Bahrain take steps 
toward comprehensive human 
rights reform. Shortly before 
leaving office, President Barack 
Obama had conditioned the sale 
of fighter jets to Bahrain on a 
set of “reform benchmarks” to 
address human rights abuses; 
Bahrain’s government ultimately 
refused to comply with Obama’s 
request with the confidence 
that the U.S. government would 
eventually cave and complete 
the sale anyways.
Sure 
enough, 
President 
Donald Trump’s administration 

has been more than eager to 
complete the sale despite “the 
Bahrainis taking even more 
steps backward … including 
the dissolution of yet another 
peaceful 
opposition 
party, 
restoring arrest powers to a 
domestic intelligence agency 
and legalizing the use of 
military courts for civilians,” 
according to the Forum on 
Arms Trade. Rachel Stohl, a 
senior associate at the Stimson 
Center, argues that the Trump 
administration’s 
decision 
to 
lift the ban is indicative of the 
United States’s global arms 
sales strategy: “prioritization of 
short-term strategic objectives 
over 
long-term 
democratic 
governance.”
Trump’s 
administration 
and its proponents — much 
like the U.K.’s government — 
have argued that arms sales 
to Bahrain actually promote 
regional stability by allowing 
the United States to monitor 
Iran. While it’s true that U.S. 
arms sales allow the United 
States a geostrategic position 
in the region, that position is 
inherently destabilizing. Even 
the economic benefits of arms 
sales are underwhelming for 
the United States, as Trump has 
outsourced the United States’s 
production of the arms it sells. 
This, in turn, has minimized the 
number of U.S. jobs created by 
arms exports from the United 
States. 
In short, the United States’s 
decision to continue arms sales 
to Bahrain is exacerbating the 
crisis in Yemen as well as aiding 
a government that prioritizes 
political power over the lives 
of its own citizens. Absent 
pressure 
from 
the 
United 
States, weapon sales to Bahrain 
can 
only 
further 
entrench 
the authority and ability of 
Bahrain’s 
government 
to 
oppress its citizens. The United 
States should cease current 
arms sales to Bahrain and agree 
to resume sales only if Bahrain 
shows marked improvement in 
its treatment of citizens.

Grand Old Polarization
B

y mid-April 2016, the U.S. 
presidential election was 
starting 
to 
take 
shape. 
Candidate Donald Trump, having 
won the Republican primary race, 
held a commanding lead over a field 
that had been whittled down to 
himself, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and 
Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Meanwhile, 
former Secretary of State Hillary 
Clinton was cruising to her expected 
coronation 
as 
the 
Democratic 
nominee. As the primary races 
solidified and public attention turned 
to November, America became 
gripped by a campaign season that 
bitterly divided the nation and gave 
way to the most hostile presidential 
election in recent memory.
Americans were at each other’s 
throats. A mid-April Pew poll found 
that 45 percent of Republicans 
considered the Democratic Party a 
threat to America’s well-being; 41 
percent of Democrats felt the same 
about Republicans.
The findings were telling of a 
deepening fault line between the 
two parties. Washington Post writer 
Aaron Blake said of the poll: “Believing 
it is a threat to your country...probably 
connotes something approaching an 
active hatred.”
But that poll was taken prior to 
the explosion of Nov. 8, 2016, without 
knowledge of the impact Trump’s 
election and presidency would have 
on political polarization. A Pew poll 
from July 2019 found that 85 percent 
of Americans feel the political debate 
in the country has become more 
negative and less respectful, and 
over half of Americans point their 
fingers at the president for this. These 
findings are also revealing: If things 
were bad in 2016, America’s profound 
divisions are not healing.
Americans’ 
perception 
of 
increasing 
political 
polarization 
is not imagined — it’s also rooted 
in a congressional reality. While 
America has experienced a steadily 
widening partisan gap since World 
War II, congressional polarization 
has seen a marked increase in the 
past decade. As a 2016 Washington 
Post article conveys, Congress is 
ideologically partisan to a degree not 
witnessed since Reconstruction.
Take it straight from the elephant’s 
mouth. Then Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. 

— who retired from politics last 
year as something of a Republican 
renegade — spoke to how partisanship 
overrides better judgement in an Oct. 
2018 interview with 60 Minutes. In 
the interview, Flake said that there 
was “not a chance” he would have 
supported an FBI investigation into 
the allegations of sexual misconduct 
leveled 
against 
Supreme 
Court 
nominee Brett Kavanaugh “if he had 
planned to run for re-election.” 
Calls to investigate Kavanaugh, 
which reached a fever pitch last 
September, came almost exclusively 
from Democratic House members. 
When pressed as to why he wouldn’t 
have supported an investigation, 
Flake 
lamented 
that 
rampant 
partisanship has prevented cross-
party cooperation, lassoing would-
be-free-thinkers back to the party 
line. “There’s no value in reaching 
across the aisle,” Flake said. “There’s 
no currency for that anymore. There’s 
no incentive.”
Flake’s commentary reflects an 
upsetting congressional rule: When 
your moral convictions would guide 
you otherwise, ignore them and 
act in the interest of your party. 
Going against your party is a sin in 
the relentlessly zero-sum game of 
congressional hardball.
While partisanship isn’t a new 
actor on the American political 
stage, today’s seemingly hopeless 
polarization of Congress and the 
American public is also unique. If 
partisan divisions haven’t always 
been so fanatical, what is responsible 
for the feverish polarization we’re 
experiencing today?
The best explanation is found in 
the rightward and leftward drifts of 
the two parties, which have left much 
more ideological real estate between 
them. While the leftward drift of the 
Democratic Party is evident in the 
rhetoric of its presidential hopefuls, 
the Republican Party has, in my view, 
become decidedly more conservative 
than the Democrats have liberal in 
the past decade. 
The GOP’s bolt to the right can 
be seen in the ideological makeup of 
the party’s supporters. Per The New 
York Times, while nearly a quarter 
of Republican voters were self-
described “moderates” in 2018, that 
contingent has shrunk to 16 percent 

within the past year. Additionally, 
the Evangelical base — an especially 
conservative demographic — grew 
from 26 percent to 32 percent in that 
time frame. 
The Republican Party has also 
continued to promote increasingly 
unpopular policy positions on 
increasingly 
important 
issues. 
According to a 2019 U.S. News & 
World Report article, 89 percent 
of Americans support expanded 
background 
checks 
for 
gun 
purchases, and 62 percent favor a 
wholesale ban on the sale of semi-
automatic weapons. The majority 
of the GOP hasn’t budged in its 
opposition to gun control. Pew 
found in Oct. 2018 that 60 percent of 
Americans believe ensuring health 
care coverage is a government 
responsibility. The GOP hasn’t 
budged in its opposition to health 
care reform. The same can be said 
for issues like abortion. While 
it seems as though Americans’ 
priorities and opinions are shifting, 
the Republican Party is stagnant. 
It is not the responsibility of 
the Republican Party, of course, 
to change its platform in response 
to changes in public opinion. If a 
Republican feels that their party no 
longer advocates for their interests, 
they don’t have to vote Republican; 
the same is true for a moderate 
Democrat who may not favor 
tbei party’s leftward drift. But, in 
addition to being poor electoral 
strategy, the GOP’s reluctance to 
entertain policy evolution as national 
opinion changes only entrenches 
outdated and unwanted positions in 
our country’s political discourse.
The Republican Party defines 
itself as conservative, but conservatism 
isn’t defined by aversion to change. 
Conservatism 
in 
the 
theoretical 
sense — a sense once employed by 
the Republican Party — champions 
prudent, measured progress. Until 
the Republican Party returns to the 
conservative principles it ostensibly 
cherishes, Americans will have to 
indefinitely tolerate our sorry state 
of politics: grand old polarization, 
courtesy of the Grand Old Party.

E

arlier 
this 
month, 
followers 
of 
Israeli 
politics 
bore 
witness 
to 
the 
second 
round 
of 
national 
elections 
in 
2019, 
the 
culmination 
of 
an 
unprecedented 
display 
of 
political theater. In a close 
contest, 
incumbent 
Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
fell short to his challenger, 
former 
Lt. 
General 
Benny 
Gantz, the Israel Defense Forces 
chief of staff from 2011 to 2015, 
in a race that was intended to 
finally determine who would 
win control of the government.
However, the election took 
a strange turn, and despite 
Netanyahu 
garnering 
fewer 
votes and therefore fewer seats 
for his party in the Knesset — 
Israel’s parliament — he has 
been granted the first chance 
to form the new government by 
Israeli President Reuven Rivlin. 
If Netanyahu succeeds, he will 
continue to serve as Prime 
Minister with the potential for 
a full, four-year term. This is 
the life in the complex Israeli 
political system.
In the election, the two main 
candidates carried a significant 
share of Israeli votes, with 
Netanyahu’s Likud and Gantz’s 
Blue and White party earning 
31 and 33 of the 120 seats in the 
Knesset, respectively. While 
Netanyahu and his leading 
opponent predictably became 
heads of the Knesset’s two 
largest 
individual 
parties, 
Netanyahu will face difficulties 
in 
creating 
a 
governing 
coalition of 61 or more Members 
of Knesset, or MKs.
Netanyahu’s main challenges 
stem from a set of corruption 
charges that range from alleged 
offers of interference in the 
Israeli media in order to boost 
positive coverage of himself 
in a prominent newspaper to 
providing tax benefits and other 
special privileges to friends. 
Ever 
since 
February, 
when 
Netanyahu-appointed Attorney 
General 
Avichai 
Mandelblit 
recommended that the prime 
minister be indicted, he has 
faced many repercussions in his 
reelection campaigns. 
Perhaps most directly, other 
politicians 
have 
expressed 
resistance 
to 
joining 
a 
Netanyahu-led coalition if he 
will be on trial during a future 
term. The most significant of 
such proclamations came from 
Gantz and his party’s co-leader, 
former journalist Yair Lapid, 
both of whom promised not to 
enter a Netanyahu coalition, 
even before April’s elections 
that 
saw 
Likud 
originally 
emerge with the most seats. 
Though Gantz’s party shares 
many policy positions with 
Likud, they were determined to 
appear as a true alternative to 
the prime minister throughout 
the election cycle. However, 
additional political factors have 
played a role in the Knesset’s 
opposition 
toward 
joining 
Netanyahu.

For Netanyahu, his history 
of 
appeasing 
former 
ultra-
orthodox coalition partners has 
carried major consequences. 
The 
most 
recent 
cycle 
of 
elections began in late 2018, 
when longtime Netanyahu ally 
and former Defense Minister 
Avigdor Lieberman withdrew 
his party from the already 
fragile coalition of 61 MKs. 
In his decision not to join 
Netanyahu’s government after 
the April elections, Lieberman 
cited Netanyahu’s willingness 
to 
allow 
exemptions 
from 
otherwise mandatory military 
conscription for ultra-orthodox 
18 year-olds. Exemptions for 
Israel’s most religious Jews, 
who claim that their youths 
cannot serve due to a variety 
of supposed justifications from 
Jewish tradition, have irritated 
much of Israeli society for quite 
some time. 

Lieberman 
seized 
his 
opportunity to create desired 
policy change and send the 
prime minister a clear warning. 
With Lieberman’s right-wing 
party winning eight seats and 
refusing to join in a coalition 
led by his former colleague, 
he has made Netanyahu’s path 
back to his old office even 
more difficult. His firmness 
in his position, along with the 
many other roadblocks that 
Netanyahu has faced, are likely 
to make his attempts to form a 
government extremely difficult, 
if not impossible altogether.
Even as Rivlin has decided to 
give Netanyahu an opportunity 
to 
form 
a 
government, 
Lieberman has instead pushed 
for a “unity government” of 
Likud, Blue and White, and his 
party, yielding a strong 72-seat 
coalition. Under this model, 
Netanyahu and Gantz would 
split a four-year term in the 
prime minister’s office. Varying 
forms of unity governments 
have been established in Israel 
before, but only once in its 
history has such a direct power-
sharing model been reached. In 
1984, Yitzhak Shamir’s Likud 
partnered with Shimon Peres’s 
Alignment party to form an 
85-seat coalition, with each 
holding the premiership for 
two years. The government 
remained intact for its full 
term, and showed that leaders 
with competing philosophies 
can unite, serve and forestall 

the frustrations of further 
elections and instability.
While this form of a coalition 
would not completely please 
the Israeli electorate, given 
the current circumstances, it 
appears to be the best, most 
realistic option available. A 
rotating 
unity 
arrangement 
would give Netanyahu a chance 
to either quietly finish his 
career as prime minister and 
possibly retire with a plea deal 
if found guilty, or time to fight 
the case being built against him 
while Gantz takes his turn as 
prime minister. Gantz would 
get a chance to prove himself 
as a competent political leader 
and give Israelis a fresh face 
and personality in the nation’s 
highest office. 
Supporters of each major 
party could find satisfaction 
from a government with little 
policy 
disagreement 
within 
its ranks. It would prevent 
Netanyahu from going through 
the near futile effort of trying to 
form an effective government 
that would be acceptable to 
his base and to most of the 
country. It would also stop him 
from calling a vote for another 
round of elections, just as he 
did in May after April’s results 
presented him with a difficult 
road to the premiership.
Outside the Knesset, most 
Israelis would likely be relieved 
that 
ultra-orthodox 
parties 
would no longer be part of a 
governing bloc. A majority of 
Israel’s citizens disagree with 
the Haredi parties on questions 
about 
public 
transportation 
over the Sabbath and ultra-
orthodox 
exemption 
from 
military service. Perhaps most 
of all, Israelis would hope to 
avoid a third round of elections 
in one year. The first two have 
been unusual enough.
In a country with so many 
competing demographics and 
agendas, it would be impossible 
for 
Israel’s 
government 
to 
satisfy all its people’s desires. 
However, when weighing the 
choices available to the newly-
elected Knesset, it becomes 
clear that a unity model would 
be best equipped to give Israelis 
what they truly want: a strong 
government 
committed 
to 
ensuring freedom and security, 
and markedly less bound by 
unpopular religious constraints 
from inflexible politicians. 
Though 
partisans 
may 
complain of their failure to 
achieve a complete victory, 
those who care most about the 
prosperity of Israel and the 
wishes of its civilians can look 
to this potential government 
not as a last resort, but as an 
opportunity. At this point, such 
an outcome appears unlikely, 
but for a significantly divided 
Israeli society, a measure of 
unity — just in time for the 
Jewish new year — may go a 
long way.

It feels inaccurate somehow to call Félicia 
Atkinson a polymath, even though she has 
established herself fairly equally as a sculptor, poet 
and electronic musician. Her several disciplines 
feel less like different worlds that she enters and 
more like parts of a continuous whole, the working-
out of a single rhizomic idea. I’m interested in how 
polymaths think: They are less beholden to the 
expectations of any single art form, and can think 
laterally and even pack up and walk out of the 
frame if need be. 
I notice that Atkinson’s music has the quality of 
her art, and, vice versa, a generative dreaminess both 
domestic and oceanic. Her art is generally large-
scale, atmospheric and somewhat unsettling while 
using familiar referents and materials. She works 
a lot with colorful fabric and with arrangements 
of household objects (vases, books, old televisions, 
crystals, fruit) on gallery floors. There’s a playful 
quality to it that is counterbalanced with a sense 
of restraint and focus. In artist statements, she 
seeks unconventional analogies that make a kind 
of intuitive sense, often conceptually linking the 
body to her sculptural and sonic materials. One 
documented piece on her website is described as “a 
feminist hymn composed as a pyramidal structure, 
referring in the same time to the A-frame houses, 
the yoga position of the triangle, the first letter of 
the roman alphabet and the feminine sex.” Her 
music has a similar quality of ghostly serendipity, 
of something deep within the subconscious 
suddenly being brought to the surface. Even by 
the standards of ambient music, Atkinson’s work 
is unusually enveloping, almost claustrophobic. 
Her 2018 album “The Flower And The Vessel” is 
a lovely assemblage of Rhodes, resonant metal 
sounds, indeterminately placed field recordings 
and Atkinson’s own voice, often whispering or 

quietly murmuring fragments of text — she has 
saidshe uses whispering in her music because 
“whispering is a way to get inside your ear.” 
She is, to a lesser extent, a writer whose work 
with language lives in a similarly beguiling 
space. A friend recently got a copy of her 2014 
book 
“Improvising 
Sculpture 
As 
Delayed 
Fictions,” which I assumed to be a theory-heavy 
international-art-English book about her sculpture 
but turned out to be something enticing, decidedly 
literary and difficult to compare to anything. 
The first thing you might notice about this 
book is how self-contained of an object it is. The 
unadorned, aggressively green cover gives almost 
no information about the book, and there is no 
author bio or explanation of purpose to be found 
anywhere. Even the opening few pages lack the 
usual copyright and publisher information (which 
is at the end), instead immediately immersing the 
reader in its strange textual world. 
The book could be 
called poetry by default, 
but it varies so much that 
any genre designation 
could be partially correct 
but would be leaving 
something crucial out. 
There 
are 
moments 
where the text, which 
is splayed all over the 
page in a semi-Concrete 
fashion, 
resembles 
a 
collage-like 
collection 
of appropriated texts. 

One page simply has nouns scattered all over the 
page: “The Book / The Painting / The Concept / 
The Secret Desire / The Freedom.” There are also 
more cohesive segments that describe a scene or 
a character, or tell self-contained, surreal fables: 
A rich, spoiled girl is “wrecking her twenties in a 
desperate dance,” a piece of scribbled-on paper 
is turned into a ready-made and displayed in the 
apartment of a wealthy woman, whose daughter 
unwittingly brings home the boy who scribbles 
on it years later. Characters occasionally recur, 
occasional development seems to begin happening 
before it’s cut off abruptly like a closed browser 
window. The most consistently recurring mode in 
“Improvising Sculpture” is Atkinson’s whimsical 
narration of the thoughts objects might have, 
interspersed with often nonspecific dialogue 
between humans. 
More frequently, though, the text of the book 
takes on an amorphous character, like something 
overheard, fragments from the middle of 
something. We are not let in on the joke here, but 
everything is halfway recognizable. “A painting 
of a tree. / How can one be a tree… / Can you feel 
the tree? / How can a painting be. How can such a 
thing be? I don’t understand the material process 
of art. How something from one’s mind can be 
transferred to paint and then to an idea? Do you 
believe in ghosts?” The language comes close 
to theorizing or describing and then dissolves 
into refusal. Words are occasionally in different 
typefaces seemingly without explanation, the 
arrangement of words on the page is either in 
bracing blocks of continuous language or in 
pointillistic fragments. All this is also interspersed 
with black-and-white photographs of Atkinson’s 
art, and it’s tempting to think that this work 
simply resembles that awkward younger brother 
of literature and criticism, the Art Book, a kind of 
writing peripheral to both art and literature. But 
because these black-and-white photographs are so 
unrelated to the body text, and because it’s too hard 
to tell what one is looking at most of the time, they 
begin to resemble visual analogues to the beguiling 
work. There’s an analogy to be made between the 
oddly indeterminate text and the images that are 
shorn of their usual mechanism for conveying 
something, especially considering that Atkinson’s 
art is so reliant on the nuances of color and texture. 
To that end, the language Atkinson uses isn’t 
exactly poetic, not quite beautiful or even really 
very stylish. Her sentences are short, declarative, 
signage-like. She frequently sounds like she is 
speaking only because she is fed up. At one point 
in the text she apologizes for her many typos by 
saying she isn’t a native speaker, but these mistakes 
feel deliberate to me. Her incorrect grammar 
gives the language of “Improvising Sculpture” a 
dreamlike quality. “First comes the dreams and 
later the words.” “She is in her early thirties, feels 
younger than what? Older than some other things, 
too.” She intersperses the text frequently with 
imperatively gentle statements: “lay down,” “roll 
roll roll for me,” “please.” There’s a tense balance, 
familiar to me from her music, between hard, 
impenetrable texture and affectionate sensuality, 
and especially in her more descriptive moments. 
“It’s June all of a sudden, it’s warm and / and 
spring feels from here like a shy little sister in the 
woods… It’s hard to concentrate because she is also 
listening to William’s conversation with Paul and 
Maria, low level words melting in the saturated 
music.” Moments like this remind me of other 
writers pushing against the narrative necessities of 
prose — William Carlos Williams, Olga Tokarczuk, 
Jenny Offill, Mary Ruefle. 
Her interest in writing these sections seems to 
be similar to some of those writers, in that her aim 
is essentially to document the texture of her life, 
the patterns of thought an artist as brilliant and 
active as Atkinson goes through in juxtaposition 
with life. “Improvising Sculpture” feels like a 
dreamy cousin to fiction, almost. What emerges 
after reading the book is a feeling of being placed 
inside of an experience, being placed inside of a life.

Emily Yang: Lost in the
world of Félicia Atkinson

Welcome. Everything is fine. I wish I could say 
that with any sort of confidence, but those four words 
inevitably mean our favorite characters are embarking 
on another insane and unworldly adventure. At the same 
time, it also means we only have twelve episodes left 
of creator Michael Schur’s dystopian afterlife comedy, 
“The Good Place,” that has defied sitcom traditions by 
reinventing itself over the course of its three-year run. 
Although I was late to discover this innovative and 
outlandish comedy — I only discovered the show as I 
was in dire need of something to download for my plane 
ride last winter break — I am truly blessed to step on The 
Trans-Eternal Railway for one final experiment.

The premiere episode of the fourth and final season 
opens up similarly to each of its predecessors with all of 
the characters facing an uncertain future and delaying 
their entry to The Bad Place. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen 
Bell, “Veronica Mars”), the former dirtbag from Arizona, 
begins her improbable quest advocating for more 
reasonable standards for acceptance into The Good 
Place with the argument that it is possible for humans 
to change after their lives on Earth end, just as she has 
done. This time around, however, Eleanor will have to 
do it without the help of her soulmate, Chidi Anagonye 
(William Jackson Harper, “Jack Ryan”). 
When Judge Jen (Maya Rudoplh, “Big Mouth”) agrees 
to allow the original architect Michael (Ted Danson, 
“Curb Your Enthusiasm”) to conduct this experiment, 
the catch is that the new test humans will be chosen by 

The Bad Place. One of the test humans, the neuroscientist 
Simone (Kirby Howell-Baptiste, “Into the Dark”), is 
a former love interest of Chidi. With the future of the 
human after-life on the line, Chidi gets his memory wiped 
out of fear that he will ruin the experiment through 
his interactions with Simone. Much of this episode is 
about the emotional toll felt by Eleanor, who is acting 
as the architect and thus is not able to achieve eternal 
happiness in a place where everyone else gets just that. 
After Simone struggles to adjust to the afterlife, as she 
believes she is in a coma and disrupts the neighborhood, 
Michael suggests they “activate” Chidi. Eleanor is quick 
to deny this plan out of fear that Chidi and Simone may 
light a spark but eventually agrees. Afterall, the fate of 
the human afterlife hangs in the balance of Eleanor. 
For the previous two seasons, fans were treated to 
hour-long double-episode premieres which helped 
to establish the season’s new plot. Whether due to 
programming conflicts or some other circumstance that 
I am unaware of, we are only treated to one 30-minute 
program block. The end of the episode leaves us with a 
cliffhanger, which is directly connected to my point that 
this episode was missing something … another part! The 
episode next week is titled “Part 2,” which means there 
is more set-up to be done before Eleanor and her gang 
establish what the tone of this final season will be. This 
is the problem with serialized comedies on network 
television: With only 22 minutes of programming time to 
work with, what is the balance between telling us enough 
information to stay excited and curious and get us to 
watch again next week, while also satisfying our needs 
for plot development? 
Although the premiere is successful and I am thrilled 
to watch this show again on a week-to-week basis, 
the delay in airing “Part 2” makes the experience less 
fulfilling compared to previous season premieres. This is 
probably due to the complex nature of the show. The only 
times we hear Tahani (Jameela Jamil, “How to Build a 
Girl”) speak are when she is name-dropping a celebrity 
she knew on Earth, and Jason (Manny Jacinto, “Bad 
Times at El Royale”) seems to only be focused on his 
kinda-relationship with Janet (D’Arcy Carden, “Barry”). 
For those who are on the edge of committing to watch the 
season, this episode neither raises nor answers enough 
questions. All this being said, I am sure next week will 
feature these missing elements.

TV REVIEW

The thing about shows that run for over five seasons is 
that the cast and crew are oftentimes tied to that project 
for that duration of their life. Kids become adults, adults get 
older and people change tremendously. “Modern Family” 
is no exception. It’s been a decade since it first aired, and if 
you can imagine how much your own life has changed in 
this time, then you can certainly imagine how this portrait 
of three families in modern day has adapted to how times 
have changed.
Although I was nine years old when “Modern Family” 
first started, I picked it up at a random time some years later 
and haven’t been able to leave it since. The show follows 
three diverse families as they learn how to navigate in the 
cruel world that is modern society. The variety of personality 
in each episode makes it easy to find at least one character to 
relate to and one you’d rather be. Unless you have the luxury 
of time, don’t binge it from the very beginning; instead, opt 
for a few seasons before the finale. You’ll be able to catch up 
quickly and share the same bittersweet feeling that devoted 
viewers will inevitably feel when the show comes to its end.
The first episode of the final season picks up right where 
the last season left off, with the birth of Haley’s (Sarah 
Hyland, “The Wedding Year”) twins. The infants won’t 
stop crying, and the instant chaos is both familiar, hilarious 
and soothing. Our favorite families are back, and with the 
witty quips it’s easy to tell that 11 seasons in, production 
and cast know exactly what they are doing. The episode is 
particularly heart-warming, as we get to see the duality of 
Haley’s irresponsible nature merge with her new experience 
as a mother. Toward the end, she accidentally locks herself 
out of the house and ends up climbing the roof and into the 
window with swiftness, like she used to do as a teenager 

when she had to sneak back into the house late at night.
Simultaneously, Cam (Eric Stonestreet, “The Secret 
Life of Pets 2”) and Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson, “Pete 
the Cat”) are back at their house holding a meeting with 
the at-risk kids at Cam’s high school, where he’s the vice 
principal. Cam accuses the kids of stealing his tacky clown 
statue, and boy, are the jokes fresh. In a world where it’s easy 
to get canceled for risky jokes (albeit, sometimes rightfully 
so), the show pushes the edge and maintains its comedy 
skillfully. He makes quick hits at the kids’ “at-risk” status, 
and in “Modern Family” fashion, they never linger too long 
on a joke. Spoiler alert: It was all a ploy enacted by Cam to get 
Mitchell to confess to throwing the clown statue away.

Even with around 11 main cast members to follow 
throughout the seasons, and with only half an hour to tell 
a story, the show never feels rushed. And while it’s a real 
shame that network television is losing a gem like this, I 
can’t help but feel happy in this bittersweet beginning that 
the show is quitting on their own terms and not because 
of the dreaded sitcom downward spiral. With 117 awards, 
there’s no doubt that the show has had a successful run up 
to this point, and it’s understandable that they want to end 
on a good note. Despite each episode’s chaos, everything is 
running like a well-oiled machine and there’s no doubt that 
the show will continue and end with dignity and warmth.

“Lost in Translation” is a movie about 
loneliness, the pitfalls of introversion and the 
secret (but widely held belief) that it’s impossible 
to be fully understood by or profoundly 
connected to someone else. This mutual 
disillusionment 
with 
human 
relationships 
turns out to be precisely what allows the 
film’s leads, Bob (Bill Murray, “Rushmore”) 
and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson, “Under the 
Skin”), to bond and, ultimately, experience the 
kind of togetherness they once thought was 
unattainable. 
Given the subject matter of the film, it’s hard 
to conceive how its soundtrack could possibly 
belong to it. The music — mainly shoegaze songs 
that found their home in the late ’80s-early ’90s 
alternative scene — is noisy and thunderous and 
totally uninhibited. In other words, it’s exactly 
what the characters — shy and secretive and 
insecure — aren’t. 
Perhaps the music serves to express what 
the characters can’t bear to. So much of “Lost 
in Translation” is about disguise and the 
artifices we use to hide our genuine selves, 
doing things not because we want to but because 
we think it’s what we’re supposed to do. Bob, 
an accomplished actor, is filming whiskey 
commercials in Tokyo when he’d rather be 
performing in plays. Charlotte is in the middle 
of an unfulfilling marriage, without any sense of 
purpose in her personal life or work. They both 
let themselves be carried along by life instead of 
taking control of it. They have become strangers 
to themselves, people who live not with passion 
but with timidity.
On the contrary, the soundtrack is anything 

but timid. It is loud and chaotic and beautiful 
precisely because it is ugly. It’s a glorious 
explosion of honest, unobstructed emotion. 
It challenges our impulse to hide from each 
other and from ourselves, like in the song 
“Sometimes,” when Kevin Shields of My Bloody 
Valentine sings, “you can’t hide from the way I 
feel.” The music says what Bob and Charlotte 
can’t find the words to tell each other, while 
hardly using any words at all. It is pure noise, 
noise you can feel from the very bottom of your 
heart, noise that demands to be listened to at the 
absolute loudest volume possible. 
Many things in this movie are, as the title might 
suggest, lost in translation. Bob and Charlotte’s 
inability to speak or understand Japanese gives 
them a sense of alienation from the culture they 
are surrounded by. Both characters struggle to 
faithfully express their thoughts and feelings 
to other people, even the people they are 
married to. But the title of the film also seems 
to be a reflection on the act of filmmaking itself. 
Something about the story being portrayed and 
the experience of being there to film it is lost 
when it is viewed just as a movie. Director Sofia 
Coppola seems fully conscious of this, and it’s 
probably why she chose to make Bob’s parting 
words to Charlotte unintelligible to viewers. 
While there’s been much speculation about what 
exactlyhe whispered into her ear, we’ll probably 
never know for sure. Yet, when I watch Scarlett 
Johansson’s face as she gazes out on the streets 
of Tokyo in the film’s final sequence, set to The 
Jesus and Mary Chain’s “Just Like Honey,” I feel 
as though I understand what she’s feeling in that 
moment in response to Bob’s words. And it’s all 
because of that song, which tells me more about 
her emotions than any words ever could. The 
music requires no translation, and because it’s 
there, nothing is really lost.

with ‘Lost in Translation’

Rock ‘n’ roll doesn’t seem too far from country 
music. They share mostly the same roots, but 
for some reason, it feels like the two shouldn’t 
commingle. Rock is jagged around the edges, 
marked by guitars crunching against crashing 
drums. Country is smooth and soft, telling 
stories of a spurned lover and what could have 
been. Occasionally, rockers make the transition 
from rock and roll to country, namely Darius 
Rucker and Steven Tyler, but seldom, if ever, is 
the transition from country to rock ‘n’ roll made 
successfully. With his new album SOUND & 
FURY, however, Sturgill Simpson looks to change 
that.
Hazy, psychedelic country subverter Sturgill 
Simpson has always toyed with the idea of rock 
music. He even covered Nirvana’s “In Bloom” 
to dazzling results. There, he pulled “In Bloom” 
into his reverb-drenched, psych-country world, 
transforming the iconic grunge track into 
something uniquely his own. With SOUND & 
FURY, he does the opposite. Simpson pushes 
himself into the world of rock ‘n’ roll, taking 
artifacts from his previous work along for the 
journey.
SOUND & FURY may be Simpson’s first full-
fledged attempt at rock music, but you wouldn’t 
guess it. It sounds like he’s been honing his 
rock skills for years. He takes signature haze 
and replaces it with smoke. That is to say, 
where his music used to transcend, it now slices 
and cuts. This is the kind of music made for 
ripping down a western highway in the early 
hours of the morning. It’s slick, it’s greasy and, 
most importantly, it’s fresh. Lead single “Sing 
Along” is the perfect introduction to this new 
era in Simpson’s career. Deliriously distorted 
guitars are accompanied by beefy bass guitar 
and warbling synthesizers, providing the post-
apocalyptic backtrack that Simpson’s vocals need 
as he bellows lines “Compromise is made out of 
peace / But history’s made out of violence / After 
the war of the world’s has ceased / All that’s left 
is deafening silence.” Simpson maintains his 
signature vocal twang, but instead of stretching 
his words as he used to do, he cuts them in half, 
wasting no time to say what he needs to say. 

What’s most impressive about SOUND & FURY 
is Simpson’s ability to maintain consistency 
between all of his releases. He continues to drop 
knowledge like on his previous releases, but now 
he’s twisting it to a darker reality. On “Make 
Art Not Friends,” he warns, “it’s getting hard 
to find a good friend / So close the door behind 
you / Before anyone come in / Nobody writes, 
and nobody calls / Nobody bother, cause I’m over 
it all.” This is not the Sturgill Simpson of yore: 
This a totally new man, one that is suspect of the 
newly-realized fame he has achieved.
This wariness is a just fit for the strung-out, 
apocalyptic feel of this album. It all culminates 
with “Mercury in Retrograde,” a steamy, synth-

driven song that ruminates on fame and all the 
bullshit that goes with it. It’s one of the more 
“country rock” songs on the album in terms of 
sound, with a full string section and twangy, 
distorted guitars, but that’s a good thing. It’s 
softer vibe nicely contrasts searing lyrics like 
“Living the dreams makes a man wanna scream” 
and “Oh, the road to Hell is paved with cruel 
intention / If it’s not nuclear war, it’s gonna be 
divine intervention.”
If anything, Sturgill Simpson’s experimentation 
on SOUND & FURY shows that he’s fully capable 
of making any kind of music he wants, something 
that the country overlords in Nashville did not 
take kindly to upon the release of his second and 
third albums. This release is a big, fat middle 
finger to the country music industry. If they don’t 
want to accept Simpson, that’s fine. He doesn’t 
want them to anyways. If the rest of the country 
scene doesn’t want him, that’s fine, too, because 
on SOUND & FURY, Simpson does rock ‘n’ roll 
as good as or even better than he does country 
music.

MUSIC REVIEW

WIKIMEDIA COMMONS

FOCUS FEATURES

Daphne du Maurier’s “Rebecca” invites 
readers into the world of Manderly, an estate 
that’s like a juicy, red apple with a brilliant 
shine on the outside, but rot within. “Rebecca” 
seduces, satisfies and scintillates its readers. 
It opens with: “I dreamt I went to Manderly 
again.” 
I read “Rebecca” for the first time the 
summer between my freshman and sophomore 
year in high school. I was stuck in a limbo 
state, alternating between the consistency 
and comfort of young-adult romances and 
the daunting classics. My English teacher 
suggested “Rebecca.” “I think you’d like it,” 
was all that she offered. And I did. On the 
surface, it checks everything off my list: 
Romance, Gothic, sardonic heroes, mystery 
and horror. In my naivety, I read it for its 
romance, crossing my fingers for our nameless 
narrator and aloof hero to get their happily-
ever-after. 
Fast-forward seven years. The sinister 
atmosphere of “Rebecca” still holds me captive. 
To faithfully summarize Rebecca would 
be a feat in and of itself. Strictly speaking, 
“Rebecca” is about our nameless heroine. She 
retrospectively speaks about her brief period 
spent at Manderly starting with her interaction 
with Maxim de Winter, the man of the manor. 
Described as insipid and unsophisticated, our 
narrator falls deeply and irrevocably in love 
with Mr. de Winter, eagerly accepting to be 

his wife and to hold the proverbial reigns of 
Manderly. In their whirlwind love-story, we’re 
offered one very important detail: Maxim 
de Winter’s previous wife, Rebecca, died in a 
horrible accident. 
Unlike traditional romances, the proposal 
occurs within the first few chapters of the 
novel instead of the end; in fact, the readers 
only get bits and crumbs of Mrs. and Mr. de 
Winter’s love story. The relationship at the 

forefront is between Mrs. de Winter and 
Rebecca. Rebecca haunts each page. It’s an 
iteration of Rebecca, Rebecca, Rebecca. Where 
our narrator is mousy, Rebecca was regal. 
From a handkerchief that smells of azaleas to 
her loyal companion, Mrs. Danvers, Rebecca is 
imprinted into the very walls of Manderly. 
Yes, “Rebecca” isn’t simply a romance. 

It’s a twisty, mind-bending novel that 
psychologically questions our understanding 
of the entire narrative. As our narrator gets 
engulfed by Rebecca’s shadows, we begin 
to question her reliability. How much of the 
information she shares is accurate? How much 
of it is a projection of her desires? “Rebecca” 
is slippery — it simultaneously embraces and 
criticizes the decadent imagery of social class. 
We’re poisoned by the sickenly sweet air of 
old bloodlines, invaluable materials and sheer 
decadence. We watch our narrator’s trajectory 
from a fresh, doe-eyed schoolgirl to a character 
preoccupied with image. And still, Rebecca is 
there, reminding our narrator that she’ll never 
be good enough. 
After all, there is no substitute for Rebecca. 
Despite having read “Rebecca” before, the 
ending still shocks me. I remember zooming 
past the last quarter wondering how I could 
have possibly missed all the clues last time. 
Daphne du Maurier is a master of spell-
binding literature. I recently ventured into 
her shorter works, particularly “Don’t Look 
Back,” and was struck by the chilling prose and 
equally terrifying ending. Because of “Don’t 
Look Back,” my walks back to my apartment at 
night are accompanied with a sense of unease. 
I wanted to see if “Rebecca” had that tangible 
element of horror that I glossed over in my 
teenage years. It did. Since its publication in 
1938, “Rebecca” has remained a bestseller. It’s 
a hauntingly provocative novel that at once 
touches, critiques and weaves a slow-burn 
mysterious narrative. It has been, and always 
will be, one of my favorite books.

and its satiny, sultry horror story

Meet Nebojsa Popovic, Michigan’s newest star

The Michigan men’s soccer 
team has a new player this 
season who is lighting up 
opposing defenses. His name is 
Nebojsa Popovic.
The forward is a graduate 
transfer 
from 
Oakland 
University spending his last 
year of eligibility in Ann Arbor. 
Since stepping on campus, he’s 
made an immediate impact, 
notching five goals and three 
assists in eight games. 
The 
sports 
management 
program and overall academics 
at Michigan were paramount 
in his decision to play for the 
Wolverines.
“What I was looking for 
was to go to a school that had 
a higher education standard,” 
Popovic said, “and Michigan 
was the best school.”
So far, he’s happy with his 
choice, enjoying the University 
and its students — debating 
which is his favorite.
“The 
campus 
and 
the 
facilities 
are 
beautiful, 
it’s 
either that or the people,” 
Popovic said. “I got to meet 
a kid who wrestles for the 
Serbian national team, and he 
just qualified for the Olympics 
in Tokyo in 2020. To me, that’s 
crazy. I can’t believe he’s in my 
class.”
On the pitch, he’s loving the 
team and the game.
“I haven’t enjoyed my soccer 
this much in, I can’t remember,” 
Popovic said in a team video. “I 
think this is the most fun I’ve 
had in a very long time.”
The 
graduate 
student 
attributes his enjoyment to his 
teammates and their talent. 
“I’m around guys who are 
just as good as me, if not better, 
and I think that makes a big 
difference. You always want to 
be in those kind of situations 
because then you’re going to 
grow as a soccer player and 
you’re going to get to learn 
from them, and it’s going to just 

make me better overall, and 
that’s just enjoyable.” 
Popovic has connected with 
his teammates quickly, and 
fans watching the team can see 
the chemistry between the men 
up top. 
But he believes the team is 
far from its peak.
“As we’re getting to know 
each other more 
and 
getting 
to 
know 
what 
we 
each 
like,” 
Popovic 
said. 
“I 
think 
that 
it 
is 
going 
to 
get 
better 
because then the 
communication 
aspect 
comes 
into it.”
That may be a 
troubling prospect for opposing 
goalkeepers, 
with 
Popovic’s 
offensive ability emerging as a 
top weapon for the Wolverines. 
With 9 matches still on the 
schedule, Popovic is on track to 
finish the season with 10 goals 
and six assists — staggering 
numbers for any forward, and 
collegiate 
career 
highs 
for 
Popovic. 

Recognized for his combined 
two 
goals 
and 
one 
assist 
against Rutgers and Oakland, 
Popovic was awarded the Big 
Ten Offensive Player of the 
Week. It was the first of the 
season given out by the Big Ten 
— an impressive accolade to 
jumpstart his season. But the 
forward felt differently about 
the praise.
“I 
mean 
I 
think 
it’s 
great, but that 
doesn’t 
come 
without 
my 
teammates,” 
Popovic 
said. 
“I think that’s 
just a testament 
to 
how 
well 
we’re 
playing 
together and I 
think if we keep that up, a lot 
of us will be getting those kind 
of awards ... Soccer is not an 
individual sport at all. If the 
team doesn’t do well none of us 
will flourish individually”
Still, while he appreciates 
the early accolades, Popovic 
only has one thing on his mind.
“I just want to win, that’s 
all I care about,” Popovic said. 

“I don’t care how we win. I 
don’t care if I score or assist or 
make a run that’s off the ball to 
create space for us to score... I 
think that’s the biggest thing 
for us right now, just to figure 
out how we can beat every 
opponent we play.”
Michigan is currently 3-2-3 
on the season and 0-0-2 in 
Big Ten play. Despite a tough 
schedule ahead, Popovic has 
confidence in the team’s ability 
and knows what it needs to do.
“Just keep doing more of the 
same thing, getting the right 
preparation in before games, 
and then following the coach’s 
gameplans to a T,” Popovic 
said. “I think we still have a 
lot of potential that’s not yet 
fulfilled, so I think it’s only 
going to get better from here to 
be honest.”
Why does he feel that way? 
To Popovic, it’s simple. And 
it’s his favorite part about the 
team.
“The way we play,” Popovic 
said, “I love that style of play... 
I love to be a part of something 
like that, if we can keep that up, 
I’m just going to keep having 
more and more fun.”

‘M’ competes in preview

The 
Michigan 
men’s 
and 
women’s cross country teams 
faced off against some of the best 
teams in the Big Ten on Saturday 
at the Buckeye Preview. The 
women won their meet — out of 12 
teams — with a score of 41 points, 
while the men tied for second out 
of eight, with Grand Valley State 
with 69 points, losing only to Penn 
State.
Just a week after freshman 
Erika VanderLende came in fourth 
place at the John McNichols 
invite, youth was once again the 
focal point for the Wolverines. 
VanderLende won her first 6,000-
meter race — the first time the 
women have raced that distance 
this season — with a time of 20:17. 
Improving on her fourth-place 
finish at John McNichols last 
weekend.
“Erika was outstanding again, 
against a good crew of people in 
her first 6K ever, ” said Michigan 
women’s coach Mike McGuire.
The rest of the Michigan 
women had a strong outing as 
well. Junior Kathryn House came 
in sixth for the Wolverines at 
20:55, followed by junior Maddy 
Trevisan in ninth, junior Micaela 
DeGenero in 11th, and junior Jena 
Metwalli in fourteenth. 
“Jenna Metwalli and Micaela 
DeGenero had outstanding races,” 
McGuire said. “We were solid 
throughout.”
Winning shouldn’t come as 
a surprise for the Wolverines’ 
women. They’ve won the Big Ten 

three consecutive seasons and are 
expected to keep their title this 
season. The men’s team is looking 
to replicate the success of the 
women as they try and improve 
upon their fourth-place finish at 
the Big Ten meet last season. But 
for now, they remain a step behind.
Juniors Jacob Branch and 
Jacob Lee led the Michigan men, 
finishing in third and fourth 
place, respectively. Branch had the 
second-fastest time through the 
third and fifth kilometers of the 
race. They both finished strong as 
well, as Lee recorded the second-
fastest time over the final three 
kilometers and Branch had the 
third fastest time. Branch and 
Lee were followed by sophomore 
Dominic Dimambro in 20th, 
freshman James Gedris in 26th, 
and freshman Colton Yesney who 
rounded out Michigan’s top five in 
29th.
The Michigan men’s team held 
back its top lineup on Saturday — 
junior Isaac Harding, sophomore 
Christian 
Hubaker, 
and 
All-
American junior Jack Aho — and 
instead opted to go with a younger 
group.
Looking ahead, the women 
don’t race again until Oct. 19 at pre-
nationals. McGuire said they’re 
going to use this time to ramp up 
training, but to also make sure 
they properly space out workouts.
As the women move into this 
training block, the men are already 
prepping for a short turnaround as 
they race at Notre Dame on Friday. 
This will be a good opportunity for 
the men to find their stride before 
the end of the regular season.

Wolverines fall to NW

To say Sunday’s field hockey 
game 
between 
Michigan 
and 
Northwestern 
had 
humble origins would be an 
understatement.
Passes skidded across the 
Evanston turf, still wet from 
two days of rain, and past the 
outstretched sticks of their 
targets. 
Possession 
deep 
in 
enemy territory was incredibly 
rare. 
Shots 
on 
goal 
were 
nonexistent. 
But when the dust cleared, 
after 60 minutes of regulation 
and 
20 
of 
sudden-death 
overtime, 
followed 
by 
a 
penalty shootout that extended 
into 
sudden 
death, 
No. 
7 
Northwestern 
(10-2 
overall, 
3-0 Big Ten) edged out No. 
9 Michigan (6-3, 1-1), 1-0 on 
Sunday.
After the dreary defensive 
gridlock that was the first 
quarter, the game began to open 
up for both squads. Buoyed 
by a group of forwards with 
elite stick technique and ball 
security, as well as legs that 
refused to turn into jelly, the 
Wildcats became dangerous in 
transition at a moment’s notice. 
The coast to coast capabilities 
of Northwestern forward Bente 
Baekers, among others, meant 
that the Wolverines’ back three 
had their work cut out for them. 
That’s not to say Michigan 
didn’t do its own damage on 
offense. The Wolverines worked 
as a unit to gain an edge in 
time of possession and spent 
significant 
portions 
of 
the 
game with numbers in Wildcat 
territory. 
Michigan 
coach 
Marcia 
Pankratz thought the team’s 
success 
stemmed 
from 
“(focusing) on basics to keep 
possession and making good 
decisions around the ball.”
As regulation expired and 
teams shrunk from eleven to 
seven players, per the rules of 
overtime, common sense would 
have it that Northwestern and 
its talented group of attackers 
would have an advantage. 

“(They) play really fast,” said 
senior 
midfielder 
Guadalupe 
Fernandez Lacort. “On defense 
(we tried to) get to the ball first.” 
Michigan’s 
aggressiveness 
in only playing two at the back 
put the Wildcats on the ropes in 
the first overtime period. Led 
by senior midfielder Fay Keijer, 
junior midfielder Kayla Reed, 
and Lacort, the Wolverines 
tacked on four shots on target 
in the first golden goal session 
alone. Northwestern appeared 
to find their offensive footing 
in the second half of overtime, 
controlling possession thanks 
to 
their 
aforementioned 
ability to change fields on 
even the smallest of turnover 
opportunities. 
But 
when 
overtime 
was 
over, neither unit had landed a 
decisive punch. 
In the penalty shootout, four 
Wolverines and four Wildcats 
scored. The lone Michigan miss, 
originally a score by Fernandez 
Lacort, was wiped away because 
of a goalkeeper obstruction foul 
confirmed by video referral. 
With a chance to win for 
Northwestern 
on 
the 
10th 
stroke of the penalty session, 
Wildcat Kayla Blas had the ball 
knocked away by sophomore 
goalkeeper Anna Speiker at the 
last moment. 
Then it was onto sudden 
death, in which video referrals 
would haunt the Wolverines in 
a fatal way. Saar de Breij opened 
the scoring for Northwestern. 
Needing a goal to stay in the 
contest, Michigan sophomore 
Kathryn Peterson made junior 
Wildcat 
goalkeeper 
Florien 
Marcussen miss and appeared 
to score well within the eight 
allotted seconds. But when 
Northwestern asked for a replay 
review, the goal was negated 
after it was determined that the 
ball struck Peterson’s foot. 
After a long sigh, Lacort 
talked about some positives she 
and the team will take away 
from Sunday. “I think we really 
had them,” she said. “We didn’t 
get the win, so it hurts, but I 
think today we got a little bit 
better.”

FIELD HOCKEY
Similar but different, York is no Quinn Hughes

One hand carried his stick. 
The other rose to his lips, 
motioning outward in a big, 
exaggerated wave as he glided 
to a stop in the corner of the 
rink.
Cam York had skated down 
the ice at Yost Ice Arena 
— empty to all except the 
Michigan hockey team and a 
few spectators. The team was 
practicing a continuous two-
on-zero drill, and the freshman 
defenseman received the puck 
at the blue line. Skating toward 
the goaltender, he shot the puck 
and found the back of the net.
And then came the celebration 
— the blow of an unmistakable 
kiss to a nonexistent crowd.
He pretended to bathe in the 
limelight before continuing to 
practice.
But make no mistake. Where 
there was emptiness, there 
will soon be a crowd, shouting 
and cheering in response to his 
celebration. After all, people 
had done the very same a year 
before for Quinn Hughes — 
the player York is expected to 
replace.
And it’s hard to not compare 
the two. They were both highly-
touted defenseman who were 
products of the U.S. National 
Team Development Program. 
They were both first-round 
picks, and they were both 
similar-framed 
offensive-
minded players that everyone 
pointed to as difference makers.
But despite their similarities, 
Cam York is no Quinn Hughes.
“I don’t think there has to be 
this big ‘Oh, Cam and Quinn’ 
thing,” said senior defenseman 
Luke Martin. “Because they’re 
different players.”
Cam York, in his final year 
with USNTDP, set the record 
for amount of points tallied by a 
defenseman with 65 points. His 
skill set includes his vision and 
passing abilities, but his shot is 
also at an elite level.
“Cam? 
… 
He 
is,” 
said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
when asked if York was a 
pass-first 
defenseman. 
“But 
he can score too. Like I’m just 

watching today, and he’s so 
smooth. He’s got a really good 
stick. I think Yorkie set the all-
time record (at the USNTDP) as 
far as points. There’s a reason 
for that.”
His ability to create on 
offense is one of his strong 
suits, and subsequently, people 
expected him to fill the role 
left by Hughes. But there are 
differences in their approach.
Whereas 
Hughes 
would 
be a puck-centric 
top-tier 
skater, 
preferring 
to 
bring the puck 
through 
the 
zones 
himself, 
York 
likes 
to 
pass the puck 
around in give-
and-go 
type 
fashion and then 
push forward without the puck. 
“Cam will pass and follow up 
ice,” Pearson said. “Cam’s not 
afraid to just move it up and 
then join the rush but Quinn 
liked to have it on his stick, 
maybe leading the rush.”
And the different styles of 
bringing 
the 
puck 
forward 
furthers their differences as 
players.
As a result of carrying the 
puck through the zone, Hughes 
jeopardizes 
his 
defensive 

positioning 
in 
ways 
York 
doesn’t.
“Yorkie’s a little different 
though,” Pearson said. “I don’t 
think he’s as — I don’t want to 
say high-risk, that’s not the 
right way to put it, but (not) 
looking to get up the ice as 
much. Cam will join, but he’s 
not leading.” 
Hughes 
would 
dominate 
the puck and lead the offense. 
Players 
and 
coaches 
alike 
knew 
that, 
leading them to 
pair him with 
someone 
who 
knew the way 
Hughes 
liked 
to 
play 
and 
cover 
for 
his 
displacement — 
a player who was 
more defensive-
minded and didn’t like to push 
up. And as a result of his far-up 
positioning, Hughes’ defense 
was spotty, ending the season 
with a plus/minus of negative-
two despite leading the team in 
points.
On the other hand, York has 
the option to sit at the blue line 
and watch the play develop. It 
prevents him from jeopardizing 
his positioning as someone who 
doesn’t push with the puck. 
“Cam 
is 
really 
strong 

defensively,” Martin said. “I’m 
playing on him in practice right 
now. And we were working 
really well together on the blue 
line.”
York’s role is to support, and 
not spearhead the offense.
“I think the main thing that 
(differentiates them) is Quinn 
was more the skater,” Pearson 
said. “And where York’s more, 
‘Well, I’m going to give you that 
pass even if it’s a short pass I’m 
going to give it to you.’ ”
And even though he’s pitted 
to take on the responsibilities 
that Hughes once held, Pearson 
thinks it will take time for 
York to transition into that 
spot. After all, Hughes was a 
second-year defenseman with 
collegiate experience under his 
belt. But Martin doesn’t see it 
that way.
“For him, I don’t think he 
has to be focused on replacing 
anyone,” Martin said. “I think 
you know, he’s a great player, 
and he does things really well. 
And I think he needs to continue 
to do those really well, for us.
“But I think for him, just, you 
know, not really listening to any 
of this outside noise.”
It’s not the outside noise he’s 
trying to hear, but the noise 
inside of Yost. And with every 
goal scored and kiss blown, it’ll 
come.

OL looks to carry improvement

As Michigan’s offense entered 
the 
season 
with 
sky-high 
expectations, every conversation 
was rooted in one assumption: 
The Wolverines would have a 
steady, reliable offensive line.
It was built into the widespread 
confidence in Shea Patterson’s 
growth and was the foundation 
behind the lack of concern in a 
run game that lost its top two ball-
carriers.
And the assumption made 
sense. Everyone except redshirt 
freshman 
right 
tackle 
Jalen 
Mayfield was a returning starter. 
Senior Ben Bredeson was a 
preseason All-American at left 
guard. Jon Runyan, Cesar Ruiz 
and Michael Onwenu had all 
blossomed into steady presences 
over the second half of 2018, 
earning 
varying 
All-Big 
Ten 
honors.
Then Runyan missed the first 
two games with a hand injury, 
creating instability in a unit that 
was supposed to be anything 
but. The result wasn’t pretty. The 
Wolverines struggled to pass 
protect against two overmatched 
defensive 
lines 
in 
Middle 
Tennessee State and Army.
Against Wisconsin, the unit 
finally burst. Shea Patterson rarely 
had time to look past his first read, 
and the running backs couldn’t 
find running lanes in a 35-14 
loss. It forced Jim Harbaugh into 
an assessment he couldn’t have 
dreamt of three weeks earlier.
“Offensive line, we talked about 
that being an experienced group,” 
Harbaugh said. “They gotta play 
good, they gotta hustle and they 
gotta protect the quarterback 
and they gotta play physical in 
both areas, in pass protection 
and the run game. It’s our job to 
get them to do that. We’ve got 
backs that need holes. We expect 
our offensive line to move people 
and that didn’t happen this past 
game.”
So as Michigan prepared to 

move beyond Wisconsin and 
salvage the rest of its season, 
physicality and hustle were heavy 
focuses in practice in the lead up to 
Saturday’s win over Rutgers. “We 
had a good week last week from a 
physicality standpoint,” Bredeson 
said. “I thought we really upped 
that from the week before against 
Wisconsin.”
But the Wolverines’ struggles 
went beyond that. An offensive 
line 
whose 
reputation 
was 
predicated on familiarity couldn’t 
get out of its own way, mixing pre-
snap penalties with holding calls 
and missed assignments.
“Just trying to make sure we 
get all our calls situated, trying 
to stay out of third-and-long 
situations,” 
Bredeson 
said 
of 
the focuses in practice after the 
Wisconsin game. “If we can get 
some yards on first and second 
down, then we won’t have to be 
in such obvious passing situations 
and that helps our protection a 
lot. Just working with (Ruiz) and 
getting the communication from 
all the positions on the line, letting 
everybody know where things 
need to be, where to slide, where 
we’re IDing things.”
The result was an offensive line 
performance that finally lived up 
to expectations. Patterson was 
still brought down for one official 
“sack,” but it came on a scramble 
out of bounds, just short of the line 
of scrimmage.
Pressure, in the traditional 

sense, was virtually non-existent. 
And for a team that was never 
supposed to worry about its 
offensive line, that’s a promising 
sign, even against Rutgers.
“I 
thought 
the 
pass 
pro 
improved a lot,” Bredeson said. 
“We were able to make some 
big in-game adjustments in the 
middle of the drive, which was 
something that we were really 
happy to see. And we had some 
small mistakes, came together, 
corrected it and were able to keep 
moving with no issues.”
Added Harbaugh: “That’s some 
of the things that we’ve been 
seeing in practice for a couple 
months now. And it was good to 
see that in the game.”
Now, the question becomes 
whether Michigan can replicate 
that performance against Iowa. 
When a reporter described the 
Hawkeyes as a “measuring stick” 
for the Wolverines’ growth since 
Wisconsin, Bredeson said, “You 
hit it right on the head.”
That, of course, can go two 
ways. Replicating its performance 
in Madison would be a death blow 
to Michigan’s season goals. But 
right now, that’s not what this 
offensive line is thinking about.
“Going against a strong defense 
like (Iowa) — I thought we had 
a good offensive week this past 
week,” Bredeson said. “And just 
carrying that on and getting to 
that next step would be huge for 
us.”

Run game proves vital for identity

The 
football 
theory 
of 
establishing the run has been long 
disproven. There’s no correlation 
between running the ball early 
and winning games, no matter 
how many coaches or players 
insist otherwise. And there’s no 
statistical reason to particularly 
care about establishing the run.
But stats aren’t everything. And 
for Michigan, it’s about something 
more than finding a statistical 
correlation to winning.
All last week, in the wake of 
Wisconsin 
manhandling 
the 
Wolverines, 
we 
heard 
about 
how Michigan wanted to be 
more physical. How when the 
Wolverines lost that, rushing for 
just 40 yards on 19 tries against the 
Badgers, they lost their identity.
So it shouldn’t come as a surprise 
that Michigan came out running 
against Rutgers, and it shouldn’t 
come as a surprise that it did so 
successfully.
“It’s important,” said senior 
guard Ben Bredeson. “You gotta 
establish the run, like you said, to 
(set up) our passes. Thought we did 
a good job with that, thought we 
ran the ball well on Saturday.”
The 
Wolverines 
scampered 
for 141 yards on the ground, their 

highest mark since the opener 
against Middle Tennessee, as their 
offense found a coherent rhythm 
for the first time all year. The runs 
set up Josh Gattis’ option game, and 
senior quarterback Shea Patterson 
looked comfortable making reads 
in the new offense for the first time.
Unlike in week two against 
Army, 
when 
freshman 
Zach 
Charbonnet carried the ball 33 
times, Michigan kept its rotation 
mixed. That’s in part due to a 
lingering injury to Charbonnet, 
who had just five carries, but 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
indicated that a committee setup 
could be here to stay.
“I liked the fact that you can 
split it up, maybe 20, 20, 20, maybe 
a few for a fourth guy,” Harbaugh 
said. “But Zach played really well. 
Christian Turner played really well 
in this game, had some really fine 
runs. And Hassan Haskins really 
played well.”
That fourth guy, presumably, 
would 
be 
Tru 
Wilson, 
who 
returned from a broken hand with 
four carries for 13 yards. Wilson 
said Monday he played with a pad 
on his hand, but it didn’t affect him.
Even against Rutgers in a 
relatively successful game on the 
ground, the numbers weren’t 
completely 
there. 
Michigan 
averaged just 3.4 yards per carry, 

and even with the caveats of 
garbage time, sacks and a lot of 
carries in the red zone, that number 
should raise eyebrows.
That’s where, to buy that the 
Wolverines found the success they 
were looking for on the ground, 
you need to buy that it was as much 
about the mentality as the bottom-
line number.
“I think we just got in a rhythm 
early and like I said, this offense 
gets in a rhythm, you can see 
the big plays that we can create,” 
Bredeson said. “That’s something 
we were able to do and we kept 
rolling with it.” 
Certainly, that much is true.
A healthier Charbonnet will 
presumably make the stats look 
better. But like everything in 
Saturday’s 52-0 win, 3.4 yards per 
carry comes with the asterisk of 
being against Rutgers, arguably the 
worst team in the Power Five.
Iowa, a team that’s giving up 
just 78.5 yards on the ground per 
game, will provide a stiffer test this 
Saturday. Don’t expect Michigan to 
stray away from its principles.
“Being a Michigan running back, 
it’s really important (to establish 
the run) because throughout the 
years, you see that they’re just a 
punishing running team,” Wilson 
said. “Just building an identity of 
being a physical team.”

Amid criticism, D-Line bounces back

A 
week 
ago, 
Michigan’s 
defensive line — so vaunted a 
year ago — left Madison among 
the most beleaguered units on 
a team that faced criticism at 
every position.
The criticism centered on 
the run game, in which the 
Wolverines allowed 359 yards 
and five touchdowns. Hidden 
behind 
those 
eye-popping 
numbers, Michigan’s pass rush 
also struggled, finishing with 
only one sack and allowing 
Wisconsin quarterback Jack 
Coan ample time to throw all 
game en route to a 13-for-16 
performance.
“(Wisconsin) controlled the 
game,” Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh said after the game. 
“With the running game, it was 
easy to see that and make the 
big plays as well, so (running 
back Jonathan Taylor) was 
impressive.”
Any 
bounceback 
the 
Wolverines provided against 
Rutgers was always going to be 
shrouded in the caveat of the 
opponent. 
While 
Wisconsin 
features one of the nation’s best 
offensive lines, Rutgers was 
overmatched 
by 
Michigan’s 
athleticism.
Still, 
dominating 
Rutgers 
beats the alternative.
Early on, it looked as if the 
easiest remaining game on 
Michigan’s 
schedule 
might 
not be as simple as promised. 
Quarterback Artur Sitkowski 
completed five straight passes, 
taking Rutgers into the red 
zone as Michigan’s defense 
unexpectedly 
found 
itself 
on the ropes on its second 
possession of the day.
As 
Sitkowski 
rolled 
out 
on 
fourth-and-5 
from 
the 
Wolverines’ 8-yard line, there 
was a sense that the play 
carried a greater importance 
than seven meaningless points 
in what would soon become a 
blowout. This was Michigan’s 
chance to put a week of talk 
about bouncing back to the test. 
So when sophomore defensive 
end 
Aidan 
Hutchinson 
stopped Sitkowski at the line 

of scrimmage, the Wolverines’ 
defense reacted accordingly.
“It 
was 
great,” 
said 
sophomore 
linebacker 
Cam 
McGrone. “You always bring 
your best on those fourth downs 
when they try to disrespect you 
and say that they can get this 
first down and get in the end 
zone so it was really good to get 
that. We needed that.”
For the rest of the day, 
Rutgers’ offense reverted to 
what was expected of it. All 10 of 
the Scarlet Knights’ remaining 
drives ended in their own 
territory. Just three featured 
first-down conversions.
Though 
Michigan’s 
pass 
rush finished with just one 
more sack than it did against 
Wisconsin, 
its 
constant 
pressure 
was 
obvious 
throughout. After looking at 
ease during points in the first 
quarter, Sitkowski rarely had 
time to look beyond his first 
read, 
forcing 
incompletions 
and dump-offs when Rutgers 
needed chunk plays.
“Man, the pressure they 
got, they made it easy on the 
secondary and the linebackers,” 
McGrone said. “It was just 
great from them and helped us 
... cause they couldn’t throw it 
anywhere, they had no time.”
The 
run 
defense 
also 
rebounded, limiting the Scarlet 
Knights to 46 yards on 29 
attempts. Their biggest run of 
the day went for just six yards 
— a touch below Wisconsin’s 
average of 6.3 per carry last 
week.
“That’s a position group 
that 
was 
really 
challenged 

during the week — the inside 
players, the nose, the three-
techniques,” Harbaugh said. 
“And I thought that group 
really responded well.”
And yes, the biggest reason 
for that response was the 
opponent. 
McGrone 
even 
admitted to needing to replicate 
Saturday’s performance next 
week, “against a better team” 
in No. 14 Iowa.
One difference that will carry 
over to Iowa is the presence of 
senior defensive tackle Michael 
Dwumfour. While Dwumfour 
sat for most of the first three 
games, a hodgepodge of players 
playing out of position failed 
to make up his production 
beside Carlo Kemp, leaving 
gaping holes in the middle 
of Michigan’s defense. In his 
return to significant playing 
time, 
the 
difference 
was 
instantly notable.
“Mike had a huge impact,” 
said junior defensive end Kwity 
Paye. “Mike’s one of our best 
pass rushers so to have him in 
there on our stunts, to be able 
to pressure the quarterback 
was huge. So I’m happy he’s 
back.”

Where 
Michigan’s 

performance on the defensive 
line against Iowa next week falls 
on the vast spectrum between 
its showings against Wisconsin 
and Rutgers remains to be seen. 
But against the Scarlet Knights, 
the Wolverines did all they 
could, quieting criticism for at 
least one week.
“We got that goose egg on 
the board,” McGrone said. “And 
that’s what we needed.”
