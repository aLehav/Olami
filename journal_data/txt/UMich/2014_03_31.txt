Continued
lawsuits stall
CSG results

Make Michigan
files four new
complaints against
three parties
By KRISTEN FEDOR
Daily Staff Reporter
Due to four new official com-
plaints filed over the course of
the weekend, the final outcome of
the March 26-27 Central Student
Government elections may really
be decided in hearings by the
University Elections Commission
Monday.
Business senior Matt Fer-
nandez, rep-manager for Make
Michigan, filed complaints
against three other parties. Make
Michigan is suing FORUM, the
Party Party and the House of
Cards Party for alleged campaign
finance violations. Additionally,
Make Michigan filed a complaint
against FORUM for allegedly
using e-mail privileges irrespon-
sibly.
The three parties whose
finances are in question will their
final vote count reduced if found
responsible for the violations.
The suit against FORUM
regarding alleged e-mail use vio-
lations could result in the dis-
qualification of the entire party
if the UEC agrees with Make
Michigan's claims. All members
running with FORUM, including
executive and legislative candi-
dates, would be entirely removed
from the election.
LSA junior Domenic Rizzolo,

outreach co-director for FORUM,
sent a campaigning e-mail on
March 27 to the FORUM team
and copied the CSG Executive
Committee listserv. Since Rizzolo
does not own this listerv, the suit
alleges he is not prove authorized
to use the listserv for communica-
tion regarding campaign materi-
als.
CSG President Michael Proppe,
a business senior, and CSG Vice
President Bobby Dishell, a Public
Policy junior and Make Michi-
gan's presidential candidate, are
the only two people with author-
ity to use the listerv for campaign-
ing purposes under the rules of
the election code. Proppe and
Dishell are listed as owners of the
"csg.execs@umich.edu" listerv on
the MCommunity online direc-
tory.
Make Michigan argues that
Rizzolo was working for the
entire FORUM party since he also
sent his e-mail to the "FORUM
Captains" and "FORUM Repre-
sentative Candidates 2014" list-
servs, both of which he owns.
According to the provisions
of the election code, two to four
demerits are assigned per party
per recipient of an e-mail deemed
in violation of the code. If the UEC
finds FORUM to be guilty of this
major infraction, up to 28 demer-
its will be assigned to the party
because seven recipients received
the e-mail in question.
The assignment of 28 demerits
would result in immediate dis-
qualification of the entire party.
The election code states that if
any party exceeds 10 demerits,

Working with

DETROIT - On Saturday,
about 1,400 students left campus
to spend their day volunteering
in Detroit as part of the Universi-
ty's 15th Detroit Partnership Day.
The Detroit Partnership, a
student-run nonprofit organiza-
tion at the University, holds DP
Day every year as a day of ser-
vice and promote ties between
the University community and
Detroit. The Detroit Partnership
also holds weekly community
service-based activities.
From approximately 10 a.m. to
4:30 p.m., students volunteered
with 19 Detroit-based organiza-
tions at multiple sites scattered
around Detroit's Brightmoor and
Southwest areas. Throughout
the day, students painted murals,
cleaned up neighborhoods and
boarded up abandoned houses.
Many nonprofits and urban
gardens have taken root in
Brightmoor, a neighborhood in
the northwest part of Detroit.
Northwest Detroit comprises of
Delray, Mexicantown and other
neighborhoods.
"There's so much hope here,"
said LSA junior Anna Salomons-
son, DP community leader. "You

Thousands turn
out for early race
with revised course
By MATTHEW JACKONEN
Daily StaffReporter
It's a test of willpower-both
mental and physical.
Sunday morning, hundreds
of runners laced up their shoes
and set out on a journey through
the heart of Ann Arbor for the
city's third annual marathon.
The marathon was hosted
by Champions for Charity, a
for-profit company based in
Ann Arbor. Four non-profits
also contributed to the event,
including the Leslie Science and
Nature Center, Shelter to Home
Animal Rescue, Ann Arbor
Marathi Mandal and Concordia
Lutheran School.
There were 367 5K finishers,
878 half-marathon finishers and

241 marathon finishers. These
numbers are a decrease from
last year's races, which included
578 5K finishers, 905 half-mar-
athon finishers and 406 mara-
thon finishers.
University alum Penn Greene
was the first person to finish
the marathon. A 2012 gradu-
ate from the School of Art &
Design, he completed the 26.2
mile race in 2:48:07. Greene said
the weather, although cold, was
"beautiful" for the runners.
"After running all winter in
the snow and the slush, it was
such a treat to run on a beauti-
ful day like this," Greene said.
"But the trick is if you're cold,
run faster."
Greene, a graduate student
at the Center for Creative Stud-
ies in Detroit, added that Ann
Arbor is a fantastic running
venue.
"It was such a treat to come
back and run in Ann Arbor,"
Greene said. "It was like coming

home."
Contestants began the race
in the northwest corner of the
Big House. The course went
through downtown Ann Arbor,
the University's campus, Ged-
des Avenue and Gallup Park,
ending on South Main Street
between East Liberty Avenue
and East Washington Street,
where participants received
medals for completing their
respective races behind cheer-
ing spectators.
The original route also
included alegthrough the Nich-
ol's Arboretum, but icy condi-
tions forced the marathon's
organizers to use an alternate
route.
The event provided many
amenities for the runners.
These included an18 on-course
aid stations where runners
could re-hydrate and eat energy

RHA encourges students
to join'allyhood' in event

'Becoming an Ally'
closes series of
diversity events
hosted by the group
By CHARLOTTE JENKINS
Daily StaffReporter
Students gathered Sunday
in Couzens Residence Hall to
learn about the importance of
allies and allyhood as part of
the Residence Hall Associa-
tion's event titled "Becoming
an Ally: The Basics of Under-
standing Diversity."
Event leaders described
allyhood as important in sup-
porting and diversifying voic-
es of oppressed groups. Allies
are typically members of a
group perceived to be privi-
leged or dominant in society.
LSA sophomore Drew
Walker, chair of the RHA
H-o

Committee for a Diverse and
Welcoming Community, said
her goal for the event was for
people to learn something new
and feel inspired to help peo-
ple in marginalized groups.
Walker added that though
the University is a diverse cam-
pus, diversity and the presence
of minority students has dwin-
dled since the 2006 state ban
on affirmative action.
The event was the fourth
and final in a series of diver-
sity events hosted by RHA this
year. Other events included
discussions about cultural
appropriation and feminism
in Miley Cyrus' new image
and the portrayal of women
in Disney movies, as well as a
screening of the movie "42" for
Black History Month.
Walker said she hopes these
events change the way stu-
dents view the RHA.
"People have this image that
RHA is just a funding source,"
5-m

Walker said. "But we have a lot
of strength on campus ... and
can be really beneficial to peo-
ple living in residence halls."
Participants discussed priv-
ilege and how identities affect
different situations. In groups,
students were randomly
assigned an identity such as
Muslim, obese, light-skinned,
middle-class, blind or physi-
cally disabled. Students were
asked to consider how these
identities would affect them
in certain situations, such as
when applying to a corporate
level job or how they would act
at a frat party.
LSA junior Emily Paull said
this activity made her think
more about what others with
different identities might face,
particularly those with learn-
ing disabilities.
"At Michigan, there is such
a strong environment of com-
petition, people are so focused
on getting the grade and hav-
ing the GPA," Paull said. "Peo-
ple don't stop and think about
people who have a learning
disability."
Paull said an understanding
of allyhood is critical to cel-
ebrate the diversity that exists
on campus.
Walker said people usually
think of an ally as an LGBTQ
ally, but she thinks the defini-
tion of allyhood is broader.
"I think an ally can be in any
form, if you're in a minority, a
female or someone with a dis-
ability," Walker said. "Even
just a plain old friend is an
ally."

pose rooms of Couzens Hall Saturday.

$15k to fig
Nearly a fifth of
undergraduates
screen positive for
an eating disorder
By TANAZ AHMED
Daily StaffReporter
On Saturday, approximately
200 students and faculty mem-
bers gathered to raise nearly
$15,000 for a variety of Nation-
al Eating Disorder Association
programs.
The walk's goal was to also
facilitate open conversation
about the prevalence of eating
disorders and raise awareness
of the disease. Beneficiaries
of the event include the Feed-
ing Hope Fund for Clinical
Research & Training, National
Eating Disorder Awareness
Week and Proud2Bme, an
online teen community that
promotes a healthy view of self-
image.
NEDA is a nonprofit organi-
zation dedicated to preventing
eating disorders as well as help-
ing those with eating disorders.
NEDA has previously organized

ht eating disorders

walks in other states such as
Arizona, Ohio and Pennsylva-
nia. The walk held in Ann Arbor
was the first of its kind held in
Michigan.
Though organizers planned
to hold the event in the Nich-
ols Arboretum, icy condi-
tions forced them to relocate
the majority of the event to
Couzens Residence Hall. Par-
ticipants completed the walk at
Palmer Field.
LSA junior Michelle Zaydlin
helped bring the NEDA Walk
to Ann Arbor. As the service
chairwoman in the Martha
Cook Building, Zaydlin orga-
nizes service projects for the
residence hail. After she con-
tacted NEDA, with the support
of the organization and the
Martha Cook service commit-
tee, the first Michigan NEDA
Walk was created.
"I have seen the impact of
eating disorders personally
and living in a building of 140
women we see a lot of issues
surrounding body image and
disordered eating," Zaydlin
wrote in an e-mail. "By having
this event on campus we allow
students to easily attend and
learn about the impact of eating


disorders and what resources
are available."
Among attendees included
members of student organiza-
tions such as the University's
chapter of Psi Chi, a psychology
honors society.
According to a study con-
ducted by U-SHAPE at the
University, 27.8 percent of
female undergraduates and 11.8
percent of male undergradu-
ates on campus screened posi-
tive for an eating disorder. For
graduate students, 21.5 percent
of females and 10.3 percent of
males also screened positive.
"These diseases often bring
with it shame, guilt and silence.
Yet, today we are here to fight
the stigma and help support eat-
ing disorder awareness, treat-
ment and research,"Zaydlin
said at the beginning of the
event.
She showed a video montage
detailing the stories of many
men and women in the commu-
nity who have struggled with
eating disorders. Zaydlin con-
cluded her opening remarks by
discussing her own experience
with an eating disorder.

Social Work student Steven
Richards, a FORUM legislative
candidate, filed a similar suit last
week against the Defend Affirma-
tive Action Party, citing e-mail
use violations. The UEC found
DAAP not guilty on the basis that
the sender of the e-mail in ques-
tion was not proven to be officially
affiliated with DAAP campaign-
ing. The main evidence FORUM
was able to provide against the
defendant was that the sender of
the e-mail was a close friend of a

The sophomore guard had
the reins to the offense. He kept
the Wolverines in the game with
an explosive first half and used
his court vision to find chances
for teammates in the second.
He finished with 24 points, but
that couldn't stop Julius Randle,
Dakari Johnson, Alex Poythress
and Marcus Lee.
"It's never easy, especially when
they get a decent amount of post
touches," said redshirt junior cen-
ter Jon Horford. "They kept feed-
ing them and feedingand feeding."
The four Kentuckybig men com-
bined for 42 points and dominated
Michigan on the boards and in the
paintcthroughout the second half.
The four posedsize mismatches
for Michigan, prompting Beilein
to move into a 1-3-1 zone defense
early in the second half. The
switch didn't make much of a dif-
ference, though, as Kentucky con-
tinued its assault on the boards.
The Wildcats collected 17 offen-
sive rebounds and 35 total com-
pared to Michigan's 24.
The Wolverines handled Ken-
tucky's size respectably in half-
court sets, but once the shot was
up, Michigan was in trouble. Per-
sistence on the glass helped Ken-
tucky coach John Calipari's team
neutralize Michigan's talent on the
perimeter. The Wolverines were
limited to a shot each possession,
while the Wildcats were present-
ed the luxury with two or three

affect election results as drasti-
cally as the e-mail violation, but
percentages of total votes may still
be deducted from each party.
Fernandez is calling for four
demerits to be assigned to each
party in question for campaign
finance violations. Each demerit
results in a 3-percent deduction of
total votes. If found guilty by the
UEC, FORUM, the Party Party
and House of Cards Party will
each have 12 percent of their total
votes deducted.
Each party in question did not
provide receipts for its campaign
funding, an infraction outlined in
the election code. The campaign
disclosure forms list each party's
expenditures, yet at the close of
campaigning, no receipts were
published. The receipts would
verify those expenditures.
Nine expenditures by FORUM,
four by the Party Party and four
first 25 miles during the months
leading up to the marathon date.
These runners logged their miles
and completed the final 1.2 miles
on Sunday.
Northfolk, Virginia resident
Ramiro Bravo, one of the par-
ticipants, said he is currently
attempting to run half-marathons
in all 50 states. He resolved in 2012
to finish the Chicago Marathon,
but Bravo said he hated running
attempts per trip down the floor.
"Whether they were tipping it in
or tipping it back, they were really
doing a good job just keeping it alive
on offense," said fifth-year senior
Jordan Morgan, who found himself
in foultrouble for much ofthe game.
The teams traded blows early,
each using its bestasset to sock the
other. Stauskas foundhimselfwith
plenty of space to operate, and he
alone provided Michigan's fire-
power in the first half. He made his
first three shots to give the Wol-
verines a quick 10 points before
taking his game to the rim. He fin-
ished the half with 18 points.
Kentuckyused its long and leap-
ing size to attack Michigan with
finishes on either side of the bas-
ket. The surprise was that it was
Lee and not Randle responsible for
the damage early on. Lee, who's
averaged 2.1 points per game this
season, scored 10 points in the first_
half. He made five shots, all within
a foot of the rim, to help the Wild-
cats erase a 32-22 Michigan lead to
force a 37-37 tie at halftime.
"You can see the size disad-
vantage was obvious out there,"
Beilein said. "But we still felt we
could finda way to win with a few
other breaks."
Michigan was able to create
opportunities late in the shot clock
and stayed within arm's reach of
John Calipari's team in the final
minutes. Twice, the Wildcats tried
to break away from Michigan in
the half - right out of the halftime
break and again with seven min-
utes remaining. They held a 62-55
advantage with 6:31 to play, but
Michigan had plenty in the tank.

by the House of Cards Party,

Make Michigan claims that since
such spending is outlined in the
list of expenditures, the failure to
provide corresponding receipts is
in violation of the election code.
The recent complaints that
are delaying the release of offi-
cial election results have already
received comment via social
media. The Party Party and Make
Michigan both officially acknowl-
edged the conflict on Twitter late
Saturday evening.
"A hotdog costume $18 / A

He's ran in 11 states so far, and
Ann Arbor has been one of the
more pleasant experiences for him.
"The only bad part from a run-
ning aspect was the roads being
as bad as they are," Bravo said.
"Other than that, it was nice, sce-
nic and well put together. It seems
like a pretty good community here
in Ann Arbor."
Giving Kentucky a taste of
its own medicine, the Wolver-
ines scrapped for three offensive
rebounds in their final possession
of the season with under a minute
left, culminating in a Morganlayup
to tie the game, 72-72.
A possession later, it was over.

Ben & Jerry's chair talks
company's beginnings

Jeff Furman
discusses social
responsiblity of
his business
By CAROLYN GEARIG
Daily StaffReporter
Despite 40-degree weather and
cloudy skies, more than 200 peo-
ple went to Rackham Auditorium
Friday afternoon for free Ben and
Jerry's ice cream - and a talk from
one of the men who started it all.
Jeff Furman, chairman of the
board of directors of Ben & Jerry's
Ice Cream, discussed the compa-
ny's socially responsible business
practices and its evolution from its
humble beginning. The difficulty
of making profits while focus-
ing on social justice led to both
growth and difficulties, culmi-
nating in the sale of the company
almost 14 years ago to Unilever,
a consumer goods company that
owns more than 400 brands.
The School of Information
sponsored the event with sup-
port from Innovate Blue, the Ross
School of Business and Innovation
and Social Entrepreneurship at
the School of Public Health. The

event included free Ben & Jerry's
ice cream and a signing ofthe book
"Ice Cream Social: The Struggle
for the Soul of Ben and Jerry's."
Furman, who has been chair-
man of the board of directors since
2010, helped found the company's
first location in 1978. It now has
more than 600 locations across
the globe, including a franchise on
South State Street inAnn Arbor.
"The struggle to maintain our
identity has always been a difficult
thing for us," he said.
The company has a three-part
mission focused on quality prod-
ucts, strong profits and social jus-
tice. Furman spoke extensively
about the company's actions to
support a variety of causes. Ben &
Jerry's shuns the use of genetically
modified organisms in its products
and uses fair trade ingredients as
often as possible, Furman said.
"To put it simply, we believe that
businesses must actively lead in
global solutions or there may never
be global solutions," Furman said.
"We must challenge the status quo."
In 2010, the company faced criti-
cism from a Washington-based
watchdog group, the Center for
Science in the Public Interest, for
marketing its ice cream as "all-
natural."
The criticism stemmed from the

use of chemically modified ingre-
dients, such as alkalized cocoa and
corn syrup. The company does use
cage-free eggs and dairy without
bovine growth hormones, but nev-
ertheless removed the "all-natural"
moniker.
"We have decided to remove
these claims and focus more
strongly on our other core values,"
said CEO Jostein Solheim wrote in
a letter to CSPL
Ben & Jerry's pays hourly
employees more than double most
states' minimum wage, and until
the company was acquired by
Unilever, the company limited its
CEO's pay to 17 times what a nor-
mal full-time worker in a store
would make.
"People can't live on $7.40 an
hour," Furman said. "We do not
treat people as transactions but
rather as individuals."
LSA sophomore Maddie Jursek
attended the event because she is
interested in social responsibility
in business.
"I'm interested in hearing about
how corporations are dealing
with changes ahead of us like cli-
mate change, poverty and similar
causes," Jursek said. "I thought it
was interesting to hear from a com-
pany that was so socially respon-
sible."

The 'U' should utilize open-source textbooks
As the prices of textbooks continue to rise, many college students
are choosing to not purchase them at all. With many students
continually struggling to pay for higher education, the added
stress of buying expensive textbooks is a serious issue. It's because of these
high prices that some universities are turning to open-source textbooks.
The University should make an effort to utilize open-source textbooks
more often in class curricula in order to reduce the cost of education for

Connecting us all

C onnecting... " said the
screen of my iPhone.
A couple of seconds
later, my younger
brother's
mischievous,
smiling face
popped on my
screen. In one
hand he held up
the phone, and
in the other he
was holding up a NIVEDITA
shiny, new black KARKI
football with
a Manchester
United logo on it. "I did OK on my
midterms, so Mummy and Papa
finally bought this for me!" "That's
awesome!" I said. "Jaldi aao (Come
here fast), we need to start the Pooja
Vedant!" "Your sister is going to get
late for class!" I heard my parents
say from the other room.
I straightened up in my chair,
pushing back my hair so my Kurti
shirt was visible, and made sure the
new fairy lights I had bought for my
room were noticeable on the phone
screen. As my brother ran across
the living room to the Pooja room in
our house, I could see that my mom
had decorated the house with flow-
ers beautifully. "Nivi beta, ready?"
"Nope!" I tried to kid.
And so we prayed and sang Bha-
jan songs - my brother and I trying
our best to mouth the right words
- then my parents showed me how
they had decorated the house. "Your
mom outdid herself this time!" said
Papa, showing me the flower petals
that formed patterns across the liv-
ing room floor. From our balcony, I
could see lights lighting up the night
everywhere, and hear fireworks
going off every other second, mak-
ing me cringe. New Delhi looked
like a beautiful, but noisy, bride - as

it always did on Diwali. I looked up
at the clock in my room - 9:30 am -
my class started in half an hour. "By
the way, the new update for iOS 7 is
available," my mom said. I laughed
and nodded, said my goodbyes, and
started packing my bag.
Diwali - the Hindu festival of
lights - was, literally, a surreal
experience in 2013. And so will
the next few ones to come. Though
this happened last November, you
can see that I remember the day
extremely well. Partly because it
made me realize how far out of my
comfort zone I have been trying to
live, but mostly because that was the
day I truly appreciated how technol-
ogy has come to affect our lives.
Every other Facebook/Intel/
Microsoft/Apple commercial I had
ever seen - y'know the cheesy,
overtly emotional kind showing
how families, friends and people in
general had been united through
the company's work - all made
sense to me that day. I don't mean
to sound like someone in love finally
understanding the meaning behind
all sentimental, sappy songs - but
despite my problem against the
dominance of boys in tech, I had
come to truly appreciate and love my
choice of major that day.
As I finished getting ready for
that morning, I remember taking
a picture of myself by those fairy
lights I bought, and sending it as a
Snapchat to all my friends with the
caption "Happy Diwali - the festi-
val of lights!" What followed was a
hilarious series of replies. From my
friends in India, I got Snaps teasing
me about all the sweets and des-
serts I would be missing, and that
it sucked for me that I had to go
to class.
Meanwhile, some my friends who
weren't from India started send-

ing me Snaps of them next to the
most random sources of light - the
chandeliers in the Law Library, the
ceiling lights in the UGLi, and even
the sun - and some just drew lights
next to their faces.
Other than realizing the fact that
I only picked people whose brains
stopped developing after middle
school to be my friends (just kid-
ding, I know they were just being
silly) no matter where I went, I also
realized how I absolutely agreed
with my mom on one thing: "What
would we do without technology?" I
couldn't help but marvel at the fact
that I was 7,500 miles away from
home celebrating one of my favor-
ite festivals in a strangely amusing
way. It made me miss my family a
little less, and appreciate people a
little more.
The point of this extremely per-
sonal anecdote is, or at least I hope
it's been, to create a little positiv-
ity around our dependence on
technology. In between deactivat-
ing accounts on social media out-
lets during exams, and blaming the
Internet and other fun tech cre-
ations for the decline in our atten-
tion span (I've been trying not to
play 2048 while writingthis article),
we have forgotten to appreciate the
good things that have come out of
this dependency. Our generation,
especially, takes technology for
granted. We know that technol-
ogy is going to continue to be a huge
influence on our lives, so we must
understand that we need to learn to
really value how it has augmented
our ability to interact. Focusing on
how it can help us create valuable
experiences can really help us make
it an asset for ourselves.

its students.
The University of Maryland, College Park
is one of the universities working on making
the transition. Open-source textbooks are
comprised of materials from a variety of
sources that are not subject to copyright
restrictions. The initiative to use open-
source textbooks is just a pilot program at
the University of Maryland but it has been
estimated that the program has saved 1,100
students $130,000 collectively.
According to the College Board, the
average university student spends $1,200
annually on textbooks and supplies, and
depending on the major, the amount can be
even higher. Open-source textbooks would
provide a free alternative to these expensive
textbooks. According to the U.S. Government
Accountability Office, average textbook
prices rose 82 percent between the years
2002 and 2012. With this kind of price hike,
students need more cost-efficient resources.
However, there are concerns that go along
with using open-source textbooks. Textbook
publishers have extensive processes involved
in editing the information presented in the
textbooks they sell. They make sure that
the materials are credible and use reliable
and correct information. It could be harder
to check the credibility and reliability of
open-source textbooks since they would be
compiled from so many different sources.
To combat the problem of credibility
and reliability, extensive review systems
should be implemented. For example, the
College Open Textbooks Collaborative
provides reviews of books used by over 200
community and two-year colleges. Reviewers
are community college professors with at
least one year of teaching experience and
their reviews are considered along with their
curriculum vitae. Open-source textbooks
should be treated as all other academic
articles are and be reviewed by experts in the
field to ensure quality information. Minimum
teaching requirements and a demonstration

of qualification should be a standard for all
reviewers, and open-source textbooks should
be constantly reviewed by these individuals
to ensure credibility and reliability.
There are already a number of simple ways
that the University can transition into an era
of cheaper textbooks. The University already
has subscriptions to many academic journals,
magazines and newspapers. Professors
should utilize these resources as often as
possible, as some classes have completely
replaced textbooks with these online articles.
Additionally, a number of professors at
the University allow students to use drafts
of textbooks they're currently writing -
sending students updated versions if certain
chapters have been edited. More professors
should consider this method, and professors
already doing so should consider allowing
other classes to use their textbook drafts.
The University should take note of the
other colleges that have already begun
to transition to open-source textbooks.
California State University, Washington State
College, the University of Minnesota and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
all have compiled giant libraries of free
course materials online within recent years.
These colleges are making an effort to save
their students money on textbooks, and the
University should do the same. However,
in doing so, the University should consider
other aspects of switching to open-source
textbooks, like providing additional printing
pages to allow students to view these
resources on paper.
With the rapid rise of collegetuition over the
past decade, colleges need to assist students in
investigating cheaper alternatives to pricey
textbooks. Textbooks are an essential tool
for learning, but their extremely high prices
provide a barrier to students. Open-source
textbooks can be that alternative, and with
proper support from the academic community,
they can be just as effective.

JEREMY KAZZAZ I
A resolution for all

This week the Daily's editorial board
appeared to come out in support of the bill
rejected twice by the Central Student Gov-
ernment, which calls for a committee to
investigate and recommend divestment of the
University's endowment from certain compa-
nies doing business with Israel.
The Daily editorial board said, "the Uni-
versity needs to institutionalize a permanent
mechanism to evaluate complaints against
companies that are suspected of doing busi-
ness with unethical regimes." That is a noble
initiative that was not at all addressed by the
divestment bill CSG considered.
The Daily editorial also said, "The reso-
lution called for CSG to petition the Board
of Regents to create an ad hoc committee to
investigate University investments in com-
panies accused of violating human rights."
That sentence is missing an important word
that changes the meaning entirely: Israel. The
Daily implied that the measure recommended
the committee investigate all companies for
human rights violations. The resolution does
no such thing, the bill requests that the Uni-
versity investigate companies doing business
with only one of many imperfect states with
which transnational corporations do busi-
ness. To illustrate the impotency of the bill to
broadly target human rights violators, if one
of the four companies listed in the resolution
stops doing business with Israel one day and
the next day is found to be complicit in the
commission of a genocide in a different coun-
try, SAFE's ad hoc 'human rights' committee
would give the investment the seal of approval.
The editorial board of the Daily either mis-
understood the language of the resolution
or was misled by its drafters into thinking
that the bill addressed globally responsible
investment rather than a targeted political
attack on Israel. Once the editorial's words
are carefully parsed it is clear that the Daily

endorsed a measure that no student group
has yet drafted and proposed to CSG.
Had Students Allied for Freedom and
Equality authored a bill striving for a Uni-
versity endowment free from investments in
irresponsible corporations around the world,
it would have remained true to its name, seek-
ing freedom and equality for all. Instead, it
introduced a bill that focuses on one side of a
complex geopolitical issue in just one country.
The bill before CSG was not interested in
guarding human rights globally. The bill was
not even drafted to protect human rights
violations committed against all Palestin-
ians. For example, it ignored the cruelty to
the Palestinians committed by the Syrian
regime and the Palestinian Authority's vio-
lations against its own citizens. Singling out
Israel is where SAFE's human rights dialogue
starts and ends. To achieve this narrow goal,
SAFE wrote a resolution that the Daily has
not properly fact checked. The resolution was
filled with sources that would be unaccept-
able in an academic paper or a news article
and they surely do not hold water as factual
support underpinning a piece of legislation.
The editorial is a call to us as students to
propose a wholly different resolution. It is a
call for us to look one by one at the 597 directly
held equities in the University's endowment
portfolio and investigate the global human
rights records of all of them. By contrast, the
SAFE BDS bill would instruct the University
to only cross-reference those companies with
ones on lists of alleged violators featured on
anti-Israel political websites.
Let us as a student body come together and
fight for human rights in every corner of the
globe. Let us fight for equality for all. We are
the thinkers of the day and together can start
building a better tomorrow.

Pineapple is one of my favorite
fruits. I love its cool, refreshing
taste. I love the way it squirts juice
onto your taste buds. I love it in my
fruit salads, I love it in my smooth-
ies, and I love it on my pizzas. I love
it by itself, just the way it is. But
because of Adam Kredo from the
Washington Free Beacon, I don't
know how I'm going to be able to
eat a pineapple ever again.
On March 26th at 10:23 am,
Kredo posted an article titled "BDS
Leader Posts 'Overtly Threaten-
ing' Photo to Facebook." In it, he
posts a Facebook photo of me with
a keffiyeh wrapped around my face
as I stick a knife into a pineapple.
The author writes: "Civil rights
leader Kenneth Marcus labeled
Kherallah's photograph as 'overtly
threatening' and said that it could
contribute to the culture of fear
within the University of Michigan's
pro-Israel community."
The article goes on to speculate
about the meaning of the pine-
apple, somehow connecting it to
Zionism and peoples' denial of the
Holocaust through an anti-Semitic
French comedian (whom I had
never heard of). Another bizarre
speculation was that since sabras
(presumably associated with Isra-
el) were not available at Michigan
grocery stores, I used a pineapple
as a substitute to convey these hor-
rible messages.
It is embarrassing to even have
to address this. None of these
claims are true whatsoever. I jok-
ingly posted the photo on Facebook
before any talk of a divestment
resolution started. I was playing on
an intramural basketball team and
posted the photo in the lead-up to
a game against a team of friends.
Their team was called Ananas -
the name of their favorite sandwich
joint in Dearborn, also the Arabic
word for pineapple. In the cap-
tion, I tagged the members of Team
Ananas and wrote, "It's on," allud-
ing to the basketball game we had
the following week.
The photo was an innocent joke
that engaged in a longstanding bas-
ketball rivalry between friends,
who were overwhelmingly Arab
and non-Arab Muslim. At another
level, the photo was intended to
make fun of racial stereotypes of

Arabs as violent and extreme by
juxtaposing the image of a "vio-
lent" Arab man with a piece of fruit.
When your identity is repeatedly
demonized in public, all you can do
is laugh it off.
What Adam Kredo did in his
article is, in a word, libel. It is
politically motivated and bigoted
journalism that targets me as a vis-
ible leader of the #UMDivest cam-
paign. Unfortunately, this sort of
individual attack against Univer-
sity students involved in the BDS
movement is not unusual. In addi-
tion to this attack against me, other
Students Allied for Freedom and
Equality students are being falsely
accused of using racial epithets
against opponents of the resolu-
tion in an attempt to distract from
our real message - that complicity
in Israel's human rights violations
has to stop - and paint us as moti-
vated by anti-Semitism. This is, in
fact, a primary tactic of opponents
of divestment, including Kenneth
Marcus himself - the "expert"
who provided Kredo with the stun-
ningly wrongheaded analysis of
what the pineapple means. Despite
Marcus's civil rights background,
he is a leader of the crusade against
campus activism for Palestinian
rights, using various legal tactics to
claim that this activism is threaten-
ing Jewish students.
Words cannot describe the kind of
outrage and emotional distress Ihave
gone through in recent days. Already,
Kredo's article has been cited in a
number of other outlets including in
The Jerusalem Post, on the Brandeis
Center for Human Rights under Law
website, and in San Diego Jewish
World. None of these sources both-
ered to verify Kredo's allegations by
reaching out to me.
My Twitter account has been
flooded with hateful and racist
messages. There are photoshopped
images of me in which I am called
a "Jihadist" and "Infidel slayer."
The emotional shock I have been
through is immeasurable. This
is something that will negatively
affect me for the rest of my life,
every time I have to go through an
airport (as if I didn't have to worry
about airports already as an Arab
male), when I apply for grad school,
and every time I interview for a

job. It does not matter how inac-
curate and libelous Kredo's article
is, the fact is that my reputation has
been unfairly tarnished and simple
Google searches will always lead to
the original false allegation.
I want to tie this back to cam-
pus. I sincerely hope that no one
at our University gave Kredo my
photo out of context with insidious
motives, but I have to question why
my Facebook account was scoured
months back*for a point of attack.
That's disconcerting in itself. More
importantly, we all have to critical-
ly examine the rhetoric surround-
ing the opposition to #UMDivest.
Many opponents of the resolution
we proposed chose to oppose us by
calling our movement "violent" and
"hateful" instead of debating us on
the actual merits of our resolution:
nonviolent divestment as a means
to advance the end of the Israeli
occupation and the discriminatory
laws Israel enforces.
These opponents included
prominent CSG members. This was
despite SAFE going to every length
imaginable to ensure that the sit-in
and the movement was a place that
was safe and loving for everyone.
This was despite Vice President for
Student Life E. Royster Harper's
public statement affirming our
peaceful methods and respect for
the space we occupied.
My advice to fellow students
is this: You came to a University.
Your opinions and political stances
are meant to be challenged. Please
engage in actual critical discourse
instead of resorting to fear-mon-
gering and baseless accusations.
If you have a case, you might be
able to challenge us for the better
by engaging with us intellectually
rather than on the basis of ad homi-
nem attacks.
Thank you to all my friends who
have supported me (both pro and
against divestment). How ironic
that a photo that was intended as
a satire of violent stereotypes of
Arabs and Muslims is taken out of
context to spread the same anti-
Arab and Islamophobic character-
izations it sought to ridicule. What
are Adam Kredo and Kenneth Mar-
cus smoking? Pineapple Express?

the city and want to change it and
want to make itcbetter."
At Neighbors Building Bright-
moor, a local organization
dedicated to neighborhood bet-
terment, students used rakes
and shovels to clean up streets
and sidewalks. They also painted
signs with inspirational messag-
es. The signs will be placed along

the Lyndon Greenway in North-
west Detroit to motivate children
as they pass by on their way to
school.
Detroit resident Dawn Wilson
Clark painted the signs along with
students. She said DP Day gives
University students the opportu-
nity to see Detroit firsthand.
"It gives them an opportunity
to see positive things in the neigh-
borhood as opposed to what they
see on the news," Clark said.
Public Policy junior Patrick
Sier, DP major events director,

said the event ending the day was
called a rally, but this year the
organization emphasized reflec-
tion. Site leaders were encouraged
to reflect on the day and ask par-
ticipants questions.
"We're trying to make this
more of a starting point for a lot
of people, tryingto get them more
interested in social justice issues,"
Salomonsson said. "You shouldn't
just do this once a year.You should
think about why it is important to
do service and continue that."
Business sophomore Trevor

Flegenheimer, who also partici-
pated in DP Day last year, said this
year the organization is focusing
more on cleaning up the city and
interacting with the Detroit com-
munity.
"I feel like we're actually in the
center of the city, making a bigger
difference," Flegenheimer said.
Business sophomore Sam
Woodbury also participated in DP
Day last year. He said this year he
felt like he was able to better con-
nect with the Detroit residents.
"I talked to someone who lives

here and she was thanking us for
coming out today, helping out her
street and helping out her com-
munity," Woodbury said. "Doing
something like that just makes
me want to come back again. It
affirms why we're here--to help
people."
Another group of students
spent the day working at The
Heidelberg Project, an outdoor
art community that transforms
abandoned houses and discarded
objects into art structures.
DP Day participants cleared

out debris and searched for pliable
wood from Heidelberg houses
that were recently burned down
by arsonists. As soot-covered
students dug through the ashes
of what once were homes, they
found ash-ridden stuffed animals
and broken records.
At the end of the day, students
gathered at the James Scott Memo-
rial Fountain on Belle Isle to reflect
on the day. Lloyd Carr, former Uni-
versity football coach - who has
attended DP Day for the past five
years - spoke to participants.

books to raise their children, in
a video that received nearly 1.2
million views on YouTube.
The appeal for an indepen-
dent and united Ukraine by the
Russian-speaking Komarovsky
underscored Ukraine's distinct
nationalidentity, and belied Rus-
sian President Vladimir Putin's
claim that Ukraine is part of the
Russian family. In fact, Russia's
invasion - which Putin justifies
by saying he needs to protect
Russian speakers - has fueled
a surge of patriotism among a
great many Ukrainians, what-
ever their language.
These feelings of unity are
underpinned by a sense of fragil-
ity stemming from being a coun-
try that has for centuries been
dominated by great empires
to the east and west. And from
folklore to ancestral traditions,
Ukraine has shown itself to
possess a distinct identity.
The Ukrainian national con-
sciousness is steeped in love
of one's land and the quest for
survival. The challenge simply
to stay whole is as acute as ever
today after Russia annexed
Ukraine's strategic Crimean
Peninsula, stoking fears that
the Kremlin is planning to
invade more Russian-speaking
eastern territories.
Ukraine, a land the size of
France with a population of
46 million, has historically
been a massive orize in the

heart of Europe. The site of the
ancient Slavic state, the Kievan
Rus, it was the regional cradle
of Orthodox Christianity. Over
centuries, parts of Ukraine have
belonged to Poland, the Austro-
Hungarian Empire, Russia and
the Soviet Union.
Ukraine is also a land steeped
in 20th century tragedy - con-
flict so traumatic that one
historian has called Ukraine
"Bloodland." The litany of
calamities include the Bolshe-
vik revolution and ensuing civil
war that brought Ukraine into
the Soviet Union; a devastating
famine engineered by Soviet
dictator Josef Stalin that killed
millions of Ukrainians; Stalin's
purges that targeted Ukraine's
intellectual elite; invasion by
Hitler and the murder of more
than 1 million of Ukrainian
Jews in the Holocaust.
Ukraine became independent
in the 1991 collapse of the Soviet
Union. It has since struggled
to define its relationship to the
world as well its ideology, shift-
ing between aspirations to be a
Western state that belongs in
the European Union, or a post-
Soviet republic that tilts toward
Russia.
Ethnic, cultural, linguis-
tic and religious similarities
between Ukrainians and Rus-
sians - as well as centuries of
shared history - have prompt-
ed Russian President Vladimir
Putin to claim that the two
nations are in fact one.
But to most Ukrainians, as
well as scholars and historians,
that is simply not true.
Komarovsky, who writes
best-selling books on pediatrics
that fight Soviet-era stereotypes
such as a purported need to
overfeed and overclothe chil-
dren, said Putin in fact woke
some Ukrainians up to the real-
ity of who they are as a people.
"Nobody has done as much
for the country's unity as Vladi-
mir Vladimirovich Putin," said
Komarovsky.
In the Russia-friendly east-
ern city of Donetsk, sales clerk
Tetyana Ryabchenko, 58, said
she was deeply hurt by Rus-
sia. "A lot of Ukrainians have
changed their attitude toward

Russia," Ryabchenko said. "One
should look at the Russians'
deeds, not words. And the deeds
are horrible."
Pollsters support the view
that Russia's invasion has fos-
tered Ukrainian unity and iden-
tity.
"It's a freedom-loving, rebel-
lious spirit that will always
remind its leaders that they are
temporary and if we want to, we
will oust them," said Volody-
myr Yermolenko, who teaches
philosophy at the Kyiv Mohyla
Academy in the Ukrainian capi-
tal.
Folklore may be one indica-
tion of the differences between
traditional Russian and Ukrai-
nian mindsets.
In a popular Russian folk tale,
a childless old couple trans-
forms a dough-boy into their
son. When the creature - called
Kolobok - disobeys his parents
and runs away, he gets eaten bya
fox. In a similar Ukrainian tale,
Ivasyk Telesyk, a boy who mate-
rialized from a piece of wood, is
also separated from his parents
through a twist of fate, but man-
ages to escape an evil snake and
return home.
"Ukraine is one big country
in defiance," said Andriy Bon-
dar, a modern Ukrainian writer.
"Ukrainians are the most stub-
born people in the world. ... The
Kolobok ending is not for us."
The most prominent literary
figures in Ukraine and Russia
also embody the differences.
Russia's great poet Aleksandr
Pushkin preached liberty in his
poems, but his family owned
serfs. Ukraine's national sym-
bol, the renowned poet Taras
Shevchenko, was born a serf
himself.
Having long specialized in
agriculture and boasting some
of Europe's most fertile soil,
Ukrainians also have strong ties
to their land.
Last spring, nearly 60 per-
cent of Ukrainians planted
potatoes on their personal
plots, according to a poll con-
ducted by the Razumkov Cen-
ter. For many, growing food is
just away of getting by; for oth-
ers, it's a tribute to ancestral
traditions.

Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his wife Emine Erdogan wave to supporters from the balcony of his rul-
ing party headquarters in Ankara, Turkey, early Monday, March 31, 2014.
Turkey's prime minister has
apparent winy in elections

Erdogan's AKP party
sweeps local races
after accusations
of corruption
ISTANBUL (AP) - Turkish
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip
Erdogan on Sunday hailed what
appeared to be a decisive victory
for his party in local elections,
providing a boost that could help
him emerge from a spate of recent
troubles.
Erdogan was not on the ballot
in the countrywide polls, but he
campaigned as if he were. Hours
after the polls closed, Turkish
newswires suggested that his
party was significantly outstrip-
ping its results of about 39 percent
in the last local elections in 2009
and roundly beating the main
opposition party.
With nearly 70 percent of the
votes counted, Erdogan's party
was above 46 percent of the votes
while the main opposition CHP
was at just over 30 percent, accord-
ingto state-run TRT television.
"I thank my Lord for granting
such a victory, such a meaning-
ful result," Erdogan said at a vic-
tory rally in Ankara, speaking to
a crowd of supporters who had
been chanting, "Turkey is proud
of you!"

Incumbent candidates from
Erdogan's Justice and Develop-
ment Party, better known by its
Turkish acronym AKP, also were
leading in high-profile races in
Istanbul and Ankara. Voter turn-
out appeared to be heavy, with
people forming long queues at
polling stations.
The strong results were a big
boost for the prime minister fol-
lowing a tumultuous corruption
scandal. In recent days, Erdogan
has also provoked outrage at home
and abroad by blocking access to
Twitter and YouTube.
Fadi Hakura, a Turkey analyst
at London-based independent
policy institute Chatham House,
said neither corruption issues nor
media freedoms determined the
elections.
"Overall, the people are happy
with the government's economic
performance," he said.
"Hisvictoryspeechwasuncom-
promising, tough and polarizing,"
the analyst added. "It is an indica-
tion that he will intensify his cur-
rent robust style of leadership."
The result could embolden
Erdogan to run for president in
an election scheduled for August.
Prior to Sunday's showing, he had
appeared to be leaning against
that route, which has risks. In a
direct vote, he would have to win
50 percent in a country that is
deeply polarized over his rule.

Erdogan and his party have
dominated Turkish politics
over the past decade in a period
of great prosperity. The party
came to power backed by a pious
Muslim base looking for greater
standing in a country that had for
decades favored a secular elite.
But AKP, whose party symbol is a
light bulb, has also cultivated an
identity of pragmatism and com-
petency.
That image has been damaged
by the corruption scandal, with
a series of leaked tapes bringing
down four ministers with rev-
elations of bribe-taking and cover-
ups. One tape allegedly involves
Erdogan and family members, but
he and his allies have rejected the
allegations as a plot orchestrated
by followers of U.S.-based Muslim
cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former
Erdogan ally who has split with
him.
Following the results, Erdo-
gan promised retribution against
Gulen's movement.
"We shall enter into their
caves," he said. "They will pay and
account for their deeds."
In the wake of the scandal,
Erdogan has shuffled thousands
of police officers and tightened
control ofthe judiciary, which had
launched investigations.
The moves prompted concern
that Erdogan was moving toward
more authoritarian rule.

Search dogs pause
in resuce operation

Authorities have
stated 30 still
missing and 18 dead
DARRINGTON, Wash. (AP)
- Families coping with the loss
of friends and neighbors sought
comfort Sunday in church ser-
vices, while crews searched for
more victims of the mudslide
that buried the mountainside
community of Oso more than a
week ago.
Many of the dogs that have
been essential in the search will
take a two-day break, rescue
crews said. Days of working in
the cold and rain have taken their
toll on the animals, and officials
say the dogs can lose their sens-
ing ability if overworked.
"The conditions on the slide
field are difficult, so this is just
a time to take care of the dogs,"
said Kris Rietmann, a spokes-
woman for the team working on
the eastern portion of the slide,
which hit March 22 about 55
miles northeast of Seattle and is
one of the deadliest in U.S. his-
tory.
Dogs from the Federal Emer-
gency Management Agency
that arrived more recently will
continue working, said Heidi
Amrine, another spokeswoman
for the operation.
Late Saturday, authorities
revised the number of people
believed to be missing from 90
to 30, while the official death
toll increased by one, to 18, said
Jason Biermann, program man-
ager at the Snohomish County
Department of Emergency Man-
agement.
Officials have said they had
expected the number of missing
to change as they worked to find
people safe and cross-referenced
a list that likely included par-

tial information and duplicate
reports.
Authorities have said they
recovered more than two dozen
bodies, but they won't be added
to the official tally until a formal
identification is made. Under-
scoring the difficulty of that
task, Biermann said crews are
not always discovering complete
remains.
Crews have completed a make-
shift road that will link one side
of the debris field to the other,
significantly aiding the recovery
operation.
They have also been working
to clear mud and debris from the
highway, leaving piles of gooey
muck, splintered wood and hous-
ing insulation on the sides of the
road.
Searchers have had to contend
with treacherous conditions,
including septic tanks, gasoline
and propane containers. When
rescuers and dogs leave the site,
they are hosed off by hazardous
materials crews.
The slide dammed up the
North Fork of the Stillaguamish
River, causing water to pool up
on the east side. The river cut a
new channel through the mud,
but the rain has raised the water
level nearly a foot, Rietmann
said.
In at least one place, the water
level got so high that it covered
areas that have already been
searched, said Tim Pierce, leader
of Washington Task Force 1, a
search-and-rescue team.
"At this point, there's no
point in searching (that area)
again until the water drops back
down," he said.
Rescuers should get some
relief soon. Conditions were
improving Sunday, and mainly
dry weather is forecast Monday
through Wednesday in western
Washington.

Don't get fooled by the bright

film. Though FoxSearchlight
the film's more
mature themes
compliment the director's patent
absurdity, the fast pace and mas-
sive cast leave many of the charac-
terrelationships-thecornerstone
of most Anderson films - with
very little time for their own matu-
ration.
The story begins with Gustave
H. (Ralph Fiennes, "Harry Pot-
ter and the Deathly Hollows"), a
world-class concierge who gets
his kicks diddling wealthy older
women, adopting the impres-
sionable, young lobby boy Zero
Moustafa (Tony Revolori, "The
Perfect Game") as his protege.
Together, they keep the legendary
Grand Budapest Hotel running

smoothly, and the guestsperfectly
happy (especially the rich, wrin-
kly cougars). When the murder of
one of Gustave's special patrons -
played by an unrecognizable Tilda
Swinton ("Moonrise Kingdom")
- lands the colorful Gustave H. in
a bleak, grey prison, however, the
duo must race against the film's
black leather clad villains to clear
his name.
Withseveredappendages,death
squadsandacarpetingofF-bombs,
"The Grand Budapest Hotel"
marks a departure from whimsi-
cal tone of most of Wes Anderson's
work. Usually, the strong sense of
community that pervades Ander-
son's films eschews the presence
of any true villains, opting instead
to recognize even the hero's rivals
and enemies as integral compo-
nents. This time, the bad guys of
"Grand Budapest," followed wher-
ever they go by an ominous, thun-
dering orchestra, appear beyond
redemption.
The startlingly gory violence
perpetrated by the thickly accent-
ed villains - portrayed by Adrien
Brody ("The Darjeeling Limited")
and a perfectly malevolent Wil-
lem Dafoe ("The Life Aquatic
with Steve Zissou") - melds well
with the quick, irreverent pace
and makes for some well-execut-
ed black humor. Unfortunately,
the plot's ceaseless forward drive
also rushes past a few of the film's
more poignant points. When Zero
reveals his tragic past to Gustave,
the dialogue flies at a steady "not
a second to breathe" clip, result-
ing in a disappointingly detached
moment that lacks in genuine feel-
ing.

Andersontdoes managetsome
rather sweet moments. At one
point, the much older version of
Zero (F. Murray Abraham, "Ama-
deus") breaks off his recounting
of the story, his face streaming
with tears, to reveal that he cannot
contain his emotions whenever he
thinks of his lost love Agatha (Sao-
irse Ronan, "The Lovely Bones").
The audience's deserved apa-
thy toward his relationship with
Agatha somewhat dulls her beau-
tiful performance. Anderson con-
stantly tells the viewers that she is
a lovely person, but fails to take the
time to really show her loveliness.
In fact, the vast majority of the
cast receives very little character-
ization, which leaves the cursory
appearances of Anderson movie
veteranssuchasJeffGoldblum, Bill
Murray, Owen Wilson and Jason
Schwartzman, and of other stars
such as Jude Law, Tom Wilkinson
and Lea Seydoux, feeling like a
cheap marketing gimmick. .
Despitetheunnecessaryensem-
ble cast and the more graphic
material, "The Grand Budapest
Hotel" is through and through a
Wes Anderson gem. The normally
colorful auteur's attempt at a more
thematically mature and gruesome
film pays off with its deadpan dark
comedy and more somber, sadden-
ing approach to aging, loss and
loneliness. It's good to see Ander-
son himself moving past his com-
fort zone, and "Grand Budapest"
excites the possibilities for his
future projects. Hopefully, Ander-
son's films will continue to mature
as he ages, without the loss of that
incredible warmth that makes his
films so appealing.

we're watching and enjoying fictional identities. Because

they are the heroes and stars
in film, we seem to believe
that they are heroes and stars
in real life too, but of course
that's an absurd connection.
And because we believe that
they're heroes and stars, we
treat them like heroes and
stars (e.g., TMZ, People, etc.).
And because we treat them
like heroes and stars, the
actors start to somewhat feel
like the heroes and stars. And
because the actors feel like
heroes and stars, they start to
believe and act like they are
heroes and stars.
Our mental
construction
of heroes is
absurd.
And thus we achieve my
main point: Brad Pitt is the
real hero. And Brad Pitt might
know that better than anyone.
He even had the good sense
to cast himself as the savior
in "12 Years a Slave," the film
that he produced. Brad Pitt
seems to understand how his
audience mistakes him for his
characters and his characters
for him. Brad Pitt knew that
the only way to make the fic-
tional savior in "12 Years a
Slave" believable was to play
the role himself and thereby
transfer the personal saint-
liness of Brad Pitt unto the
character. And who will doubt
that personal saintliness of
Brad Pitt? Just look at his
beautiful face and all his phi-
lanthropy.
So, try as they might, the
2014 Academy Awards show
won't convince us that fiction-
al characters are the "Heroes
of Hollywood," because we all
know better. When wanting
someone to believe or looking
for a personal hero, there's lit-
tle doubt that celebrities are
the best choice. But, if that
seems absurd, or if our uncon-
scious construction of the
Hollywood Heroes appears
too problematic, then maybe
seek heroes elsewhere. Or,
maybe, stop seeking heroes
altogether and merely look in
the mirror.

than the plot, Open Road
and your eyes
are half open
anyway, and you can look to the
screen every now and then and
laugh.
Perhaps director David Ayer
("End of Watch") would have
done better to not take "Sabotage"
so seriously. The film ends up so
wildly implausible that it results
in nothing but accidental com-
edy. Any movie starring Arnold
Schwarzenegger ("Conan the Bar-
barian"), of course, is fated to be a
little ridiculous. That being said,
this role is new territory for Arnold
- one that we would expect to see
played by the likes of Liam Nee-
son - and he does seem out of his
comfort zone. He's not as pompous
as in the "Terminator" series and

appears more measured than he
was in his pre-political filmcareer.
Arnold plays Breacher, a strug-
gling drug enforcement agent who
strikes gold when his loyal team
bustsacocaine cartelandruns into
millions of dollars in contraband.
The agents are - often cheesily
- portrayed as a close-knit family
in the movie, not unlike what we
find in "The Fast and the Furious"
series, another of Ayer's works.
Following the bust, they become
the target of a masterful scheme
to destroy their reputations and
to frame them for the embezzle-
ment of 10 million dollars.
"Sabotage" was always going
to be how Arnold's comeback
would be judged. But to the
credit of the cast, one of the more
prized feats of this movie is its
depth, studded with actors that
were made for these kinds of
roles, led by Sam Worthington
("Man on a Ledge") and Terrence
Howard ("Ray"). They have col-
orful nicknames like "Sugar,"
"Neck" and "Grinder" that dis-
play an overdone display of bond-
ing. They make the best of an
occasionally troublesome script
and often try too hard to bring
it to life. Joe Manganiello ("Spi-
der-Man") steals every one of
his scenes, regardless of having a
few scarce lines, and he should be
looking at greater roles after his
performance.
No critic can come away from
the film without pointing out

the hilarity of Olivia Williams's
("The Sixth Sense") Southern
accent. Williams plays a local cop
who takes an intimate interest in
Breacher's case. If the produc-
tion staff hired accent trainers,
they did not care to specify a
Southern region, and the prod-
uct is stereotypical enough to dip
its way into satire. It's even more
ridiculous than Arnold's macho
Austrian accent, which still can-
not be taken seriously.
The most surprising aspect of
"Sabotage," though, is that it's
not the non-stop fight scene that
the teaser trailers would have led
you to believe. The plot is instead
a gripping mystery, and if you.
can get past the botched accents
and broken script, you will find
yourself on the edge of your seat.
The gore, at least, is a spectacle
to behold. Rife with violence, not
the least of which is atrail of dead
bodies laced with cash, the film
more than earns its R rating. It
begins with a gut-wrenching and
discomforting scene as Arnold
looks on in mute pain while watch-
ing a woman being tortured on a
screen.
The tone is set from then on, and
we must suspend our disbelief and
our incredulity for the rest of the
movie as we watch a gory spectacle
of unintended hilarity. But in the
final estimation, Arnold fans will
find here a welcome reminder of
earlier days, if they can only with-
hold the urge to snort out loud.

of rEVOLU-
TION, works Free
to cultivate
an environ-
ment of respect and safety for
all members of the University
by providing educational and
supportive services related to
issues of sexual violence, sexual
harassment, intimate partner
violence and stalking.
SAPAC is composed of a

highly dedicated network of
allies and volunteers, includ-
ing LSA senior Nicole Corrigan,
who serves as co-coordinator
for the Networking, Public-
ity and Activism program at
SAPAC. Part of SAPAC's out-
reach includes the "rEVOLU-
TION: Making Art for Change"
exhibition.
"I believe that art is an excel-
lent way to engage with audi-
ences that are usually less
receptive to SAPAC's message,"
Corrigan said, "Which allows
us to connect with more people
on campusuand raise awareness
around issues of sexualized vio-
lence. The slogan 'Making art
for change' reflects our desire
to use art to positively affect
our campus, with our end goal
always being the eventual end of
sexualized violence."
"We ask for submissions of art
of any medium that follows the
themes of sexism, gender, sex-
ual violence or empowerment
and display the art for a week in
April, which is Sexual Assault
Awareness Month," Corrigan
said. "At the end of the week,
we hold a closing reception for
people to come view the work,
and we have musical or spoken
word performances, along with
remarks by administrators of

the University."
The exhibit continues to
develop and recently added new
pieces that provide a better fit
for SAPAC's overall mission.
The number of submissions each
year has been on the rise, giv-
ing the event's organizers more
freedom to highlight the best
pieces.
"Over the years, as rEV has
become more established and
better-known, we have increas-
ingly received more submissions
from not only local artists, but
also artists from the other side
of the country," Corrigan said.
Art may not seem like the
most likely tool for an organi-
zation that deals with sexual
violence, but the past success of
the exhibition has proven how
effective art can be at communi-
cating SAPAC's message.
"I hope that people who come
to rEVOLUTION who have
never been exposed to SAPAC
or worked to end sexualized vio-
lence will gain some knowledge
and comfort with these issues
and be interested in learning
more in the future," Corrigan
said. "This show will help raise
awareness about what SAPAC is
and what resources we provide
for the campus in an enjoyable
and approachable way."

The poignant tale, if anything,
reminds us, in 2014, that hard-as-

resonates because it reaffirms that
Cain and his lineage were jerks,

'Girls' ends on an exciting note

By MADDIE THOMAS
Daily TV/NewMediaEditor
Relationships are fucking hard.
Building one singular, function-
ing adult life is difficult enough;
trying to coor-
dinate two in
tandem can be
nearly impossi- Girls
ble. Sometimes
things work out Season 3
but sometimes Finale
they don't, and
for a significant HBO
population of
overachieving twentysomethings,
chasing the elusive idea of "per-
sonal success" ends up taking
priority over maintaining relation-
ships. In both romance and friend-
ship, thisnwas the mantra of"Girls"
season three. Sometimes you have
to be selfish, and though Hannah
Horvath is generally a little too
good at putting herself before oth-
ers, the writers of "Girls" are final-
ly giving her a chance to do what
she does best.
Warning:Spoilersfollow.
"Two Plane Rides" effectively
wrapped up all of the season'splot-
lines in one way or another. Adam
and Desi's play, "Major Barbara"
opens on Broadway. Shoshanna
learns that she is three credits
short of graduating from NYU
on time (thanks to a failing grade
in "glaciology"). Marnie finally
makes out withDesionly tolater be
confronted by his girlfriend. Jessa
agrees to help her new employer,
BeeDee, commit suicide, and ends
up frantically dialing 911 when
BeeDee changes her mind at the

last minute. Oh, and Adam's sister
who disappeared four episodes
ago finally re-appears! Turns out
she's been living downstairs with
Laird, and she's pregnant with his
spawn.
The episode's most impor-
tant revelation, though, comes
in the first five minutes. Hannah
is accepted to the Iowa Writers'
Workshop, (described by Marnie
as, "like, the best MFA program
in the world"). In typical Han-
nah fashion, she sneaks backstage
before opening night of Adam's
Broadway debut to share the excit-
ing news (brag), effectively mess-
ing up Adam's mojo on the biggest
night of his professional life.
The strain in Hannah and
Adam's relationship comes from
thebalanceof professionalsuccess
and personal fulfillment - not
uncommon territory for televi-
sion relationships, but somehow
totally refreshing in this youth-
ful, creative setting. The tension
has consistently been sharp, well
developed and thoughtful all
season. Hannah attempts to play
the supportive girlfriend role
while Adam achieves his acting
dreams, but she ultimately can't
control the jealousy that comes
with watching someone close to
you succeed creatively while you
struggle. It's a testament to the
show's writers, that when Adam
and Hannah fight at the end of the
finale, we're not left in emotional
turmoil over whether or not they
will break up; the episode's final
shot is of Hannah clutching her
Iowa acceptance letter close to
her heart, smiling.

The best parts of "Girls" this
season explored the nuances
of what relationships are really
like for young adults. Hannah's
friendships with the other Girls
are disintegrating, not because
of any dramatic moment that can
be pin-pointed, but more because
they're all headed in different
directions and chasing different
things. Sometimes people drift
apart and that's just the way life
is.
The third season of "Girls"
wasn't without its faults -
Shoshanna and Jessa continue to
be criminally misused supporting
characters - but the strength of
Adam and Hannah's arc, espe-
cially in the finale, has somehow
managed to make up for it. There
aren't many shows out there that
dare to separate their protagonist
from the rest of the characters,
but a season of Hannah in Iowa
could be a great thing for "Girls"
in terms of generating bold and
interesting content and in terms
of giving the supporting cast a
chance to shine.
Now is the time for Hannah to
put herself and her career first.
As her parents remind her, when
an opportunity as life changing
as Iowa comes along, you take it
and you make it work. Hannah
is finally in a position to be self-
ish for good reason - even if it
means leaving her "friends" and
boyfriend behind to begin a new
chapter in her life. It's uncharted
territory for the show, but ven-
turing into uncharted territory is
exactly what Lena Dunham and
"Girls" thrive on.

NDIANAPOLIS -
Moments after the game,
the sun is low in the sky
and Lucas Oil Stadium casts a
long shadow
across
Indianapolis
as, inside,
Michigan
walks off
the court for
the last time
together. ZACH
Jordan HELFAND
Morgan is
first, well
before anyone else. Glenn
Robinson III gives a quick
wave to the crowd and puts
his head down. Nik Stauskas
is emotionless. Mitch McGary,
who was never getting into the
game, walks off wearing the
uniform his teammates have
insisted he wear.
Later, Morgan, held up by
his press conference, is one of
the last to enter the Michigan
locker room. Most of the room
is composed except for Zak
Irvin, who is emotional in one
corner of the room, and for
Morgan. He wipes his face with
his sleeve and cries in front of
the television cameras.
His teammates have said
the loss is all the more difficult
because it means they'll
never play another game with
Morgan. The senior doesn't
know how to respond.
He pauses to wipe his eyes.
"I didn't expect it to be my
last game," Morgan says.
"It's over. I don't know what
else to say."
It's over - much later than
anyone anticipated. Without
Trey Burke, without Tim
Hardaway Jr., without McGary,
this team didn't just win the Big
Ten. It dominated. It improved,
steadily, each game. The pieces,
especially offensively, meshed

seamlessly.
A photo comes to mind now
from the summer of 2012. The
Michigan men's basketball
team's incoming class is posing
together at the basketball
facilities, maybe for the first
time all together.
Caris LeVert is wearing
cargo shorts. Spike Albrecht
looks small, even next to the
wiry LeVert. All have their
arms around each other, except
Robinson, who has his hands
in his pockets and smiles big.
McGary looks like akid at
summer camp. Stauskas stands
at the edge and looks moody.
College basketball today is
brutal in this regard. Jordan
Morgans are rare. Play as well
as Michigan has and you risk
losing your best players. A
two-year-old photo feels like
a sepia-toned memory. Almost
certainly, some of those players
will be gone next year.
It's unclear what Michigan
could have done differently
against Kentucky. It's unclear
what Michigan could have done
better. A few more box outs,
maybe. Less foul trouble.
But the Wolverines played
at just about its peak and stood
with Kentucky's size and
talent and saidbeat this. And
Kentucky did.
It was hard to ask much more
from this team in this game,
this season. Michigan's big men,
simply, weren't big. Kentucky
was too much to handle above
the rim. The final six minutes
on Sunday were the best
basketball of this thoroughly
entertaining tournament.
Michigan takes a timeout,
down seven, the game slipping
away. A pretty drive and kick
back by LeVert finds Robinson
open in the corner. His shooting
has been inconsistent for most
of the season. It's good. Four-

point game now.
Two possessions later,
Morgan gets a put-back and
the foul. Free throw good. One
point game -and now we're
off.
Aaron Harrison three.
Morgan dunk. Kentucky layup.
Robinson layup. Kentucky
layup. The under-four-minutes
television timeout feels
akin to interrupting Mozart
mid-symphony to sell a few
extra bratwursts. Damn your
television timeouts.
Back now. Stauskas makes
both on a shooting foul.
Harrison three. Robinson three.
Nine possessions now without
so much as a missed shot. How
much fun is this?
Michigan needs two to tie
now. so John Beilein takes a

timeout. And then LeVert goes
off. Stauskas misses a layup,
but LeVert grabs it and dishes.
Stauskas, again, from three rims
out and LeVert slashes into the
paint, dives after the ball and,
falling backward, dishes back
to Stauskas. Another miss, but
a hand - likely that of Julius
Randle of Kentucky - redirects
the ball back in. Tie game.
This right here was
Michigan's season. A flawless,
smart offense (the most
efficient, ever, it turns out,
at least since we've started
keeping track of such stats);
a socialist-like insistence on
sharing the basketball; and
more effort than defense.
LeVert was not going to let
Kentucky get the ball back
before Michigan made a basket.

Then Aaron Harrison -
that's Aaron Bleeping Harrison,
to translate for Ann Arbor
readers - hit the shot of his
young career. Stauskas' prayer
went short. And Kentucky won.
Michigan will be back here
again. This feels more certain
than it has in forever.
For Michigan, this hurt
not because it gave Kentucky
anything. It didn't. It hurt not
because it squandered a rare
opportunity. It will come again.
It hurts because it won't be
with this team, this thoroughly
surprising and likeable team.
It hurts, because in college
basketball today, teams like
this are like comets - brilliant,
breathtaking, brief. It hurts
because that photo feels
nostalgic. And it's from 2012. It

hurts because of Morgan.
Morgan is talking about this
team in the press conference
after the game. He's the last one
to speak before it's over.
"Yeah, I mean, just this year
has been the most fun time
I've had, probably, playing
basketball, ever," he says.
It's over now, and it hurts
for Michigan, butI don't know
what else to say except: how
much fun was that?

Wolverines take fourth,
claim two NCAA Titles

Michigan BIG champs

By MAX BULTMAN
Daily Sports Writer
For the second straight year,
the Michigan men's swimming
team boarded a team bus with
two NCAA Championship
trophies.
But this time, instead of
taking the crown as a team,
the Wolverines placed fourth
at the NCAA Championships,
with senior Connor Jaeger and
sophomore Dylan Bosch claiming
individual national titles.
No. 2 Michigan entered the
meet knowing it would be tough

in the Jamail Texas Swimming
Center, powering himself to
victory in 1:39.33. Along with
breaking Tom Shields' NCAA
record, Bosch also seta U.S. Open

Shields and Michael Phelps.
The Wolverines erupted on
the pool-deck, drowning out all
other noise in ecstasy for their
teammate.

touched the wall. "That is the

Bosch's NCAA- Mike Bottom. "Sometimes it's

re-shave for NCAA's after such
race as the an emotional win."
eft no doubters The times the Wolverines

posted on the first two days were
still nothing to scoff at. Senior
Kyle Whitaker was barely a
second off an NCAA record in the
200-yard individual medley, and
junior Richard Funk swam aSl.96
in the 100-yard breaststroke.
But at the NCAA
Championships, everyone brings
their best, and Michigan fell
behind by nearly 100 points after
the first two days to the Golden
Bears and Longhorns.
So the Wolverines adjusted.
Bottom shifted his team's focus
from trying to make up all the
points at once to swimming each
race for the team.
Once that happened, things
began shifting back in the
Wolverines' favor. Jaeger, who
placed third in Friday's 500-
yard freestyle, defended his
national title in the 1,650-yard
freestyle, winning the event in
14:29.27.
"He felt like he let the team
down in the 500," Bottom
said. "He was apologizing to
the whole team this morning.
... They really hold each other
accountable and want to do it for
each other. He was inspired, and
he swam that way."
The performances by Jaeger
and Bosch were indicative not
only of the talent Michigan has,
but also of the way it handles
disappointment.
"We made peace with
(not winning the team
championship)," Bosch said
"We'll be back next year."
It can be hard to handle the
emotions of coming up just
short. But don't tell that to the
Wolverines. They're too busy
celebrating their teammates
and their trophies.

Mikulak, Golder
earn individual
recognition as
Wolverines roll
By CAROLYN KODIS
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan men's
gymnastics team had one word
in mind when it set its goals at
the beginning of the season:
repeat. Repeat as conference
champion. Repeat as National
champions.
Friday night, No. 4 Michigan
achieved the former with a final
score of 448.20 at the Big Ten

in 14 years.
"I'm just really proud of
everyone for going out and
performing their best," Mikulak
said. "Being able to put up a
combined team total of 448.20
really set the standard for what
our goals are for the next couple
weeks and shows that we're
here to win and won't settle for
anything less."
Day one of competition
started off strong when
Michigan broke an NCAA
record on the vault with a team
score of 75.80. The effort was
led by freshman Tristan Perez-

earned him a 15.30. Mikulak

Michigan a legacy years in the making

INDIANAPOLIS - Legacies

A team's season was a

only to fall flat in November

10 straight wins en route to a
runaway Big Ten Championship?
Last season's team was
supposed to be good, but its
shocking run to No. 1, and six
weeks later, to the national title
game, stole our hearts because it
was so unexpected.
This year, for the first time
since the Fab Five left Ann
Arbor, a Final Four wasn't just
a goal.
"Last year, we just wanted to
get there," said Glenn Robinson

just wanted to getthere. This
year, we expected to be back
in the same position and we
expected to make it to the Final

Sunday night, they were
close. But they fell short when
Nik Stauskas' desperation heave
caromed off the backboard to
bring the Wolverines' season to
an end.
The season was a letdown -
sort of.
"I remember that day when
we lost to Arizona," Stauskas
said, his eyes still red and moist.
"We were 6-4, and even Coach
Beilein told us, he said, 'If we

going to make the tournament.'

Final Four in as many years. It
was a disappointment and an
accomplishment wrapped into

But they'll be back.
"The sun will come up

"I'll have a cup of coffee - it

So maybe that feeling is this

walk-off hit to lift Michigan to

the Wolverines (3-3 Big Ten,

in five games.

But after a long weekend,

that lasted nearly an hour, four
Michigan pitchers combined to
surrender three hits, five walks
and a five-run lead. After a
lifeless bottom half of the inning

deflated. With 10 of their losses
coming by two runs or fewer,
they were in the midst of an all-
too-familiar narrative.
But freshman right-hander
Brett Adcock bucked the trend.
After getting drilled by a line

before barely throwing out the
runner to end the top of the ninth

With two on, two outs, the

Wolverines best
UC Davis in OT

Softball sweeps Nittany Lions

By MITCH BECKMAN

March Madness was alive and

but the drama of the month
wasn't

to the MICHIGAN 13
hardwood.
The Michigan women's
lacrosse team provided plenty of
excitement on the Big House turf
Sunday, winning over UC Davis
13-12 in a riveting four-overtime
marathon game, which lasted
almost two hours and 45 minutes.
The result was the program's first
ever win.
When freshman midfielder
Anna Schueler notched the
game-winning goal, the team
jubijantly streamed onto the
field, mobbing her in celebration.
This was the second time Sunday
the Wolverines had celebrated a
winninggoal.
The first time was after
midfielder Madeline Dion's
bounceshothittheback ofthenet
as time expired, but the referees
conferred and ruled that Dion's
goal went in after the buzzer,
sending the dejected Michigan
squad back to the bench.
Fourteen more minutes of
lacrosse and three goals later, the
result was the same. Freshman
attackman Tess Korten scored
her fifth ofthe daywith21seconds
left in the second overtime. Once
again, it seemed like Michigan
(1-8) would be winning its first-
ever game, but the Aggies (6-4)
controlled the draw and worked
the ball downfield to score with
seven seconds remaining.
Both teams had chances to end
it in the third OT, which, unlike
the first two, is a sudden-victory
format. Freshman goaltender
Allison Silber made her biggest
save of the game off a UC Davis
free position to continue the
game. On the offensive end, the
Wolverines failed to convert on
three free position attempts, but
the misses became irrelevant as

soon as Schueler's shot crossed
the line.
"I think everyone really
wanted to get the game over
with," Schueler said.
Michigan, which lost its
first eight games of the year,
recognized the significance of
the win, but understood the win
is by no means an endpoint.
"This is history today," said
coach Jennifer Ulehla. "I'm so
happy for this program and
the young women who have
worked so hard, and obviously
worked really hard today. This
is a milestone for us, and they're
getting to the point where they
understand what it takes and
how much they have to fight."
The five goals apiece from
Schueler and Korten were
complemented by midfielder
Kim Coughlin, who added two,
and freshman attacker Allie
Breitfeller, who opened the
scoring early in the first half.
Schueler's offensive outburst
marked her third straight game
with three or more goals. Back-
to-back hat tricks last week
garnered her the American
Lacrosse Conference Rookie of
the Week award, and she showed
no signs of slowing down Sunday.
"We've been going over
our offense trying to get the
chemistry we haven't really
had," Schueler said. "The past
couple games, we've really
gotten ina flow."
At the end of the day, Ulehla
said the win is a testament to the
resilience of the team as well as
the talent. After Dion's shot was
overturned, Michigan was forced
to recoup from the ecstasy of
believing it had won its first game
and go back out on the field as if
nothing had happened.
Though the Wolverines
have a quick turnaround,
playing archrival Ohio State on
Wednesday, they will certainly
spend as much time as they can
reveling in their first win. It's
not everyday you make history in
Michigan sports.

put a
dent in the domination the
Wolverines (6-0 Big Ten, 25-6
overall) asserted all weekend.
Three strong pitching
performances and an offense
that cracked out five five-run
innings earned Michigan three
blowout wins - 6-0, 22-0 and
12-4, the last two in five innings
- this weekend at Penn State
(0-6, 6-21).
The key to the series against
the Nittany Lions wasn't the
power punch that knocked six
balls out of the park last weekend
against Indiana. Rather, it was
a consistent lineup that piled
up base runners, led by senior
outfielders Lyndsay Doyle and
Nicole Sappingfield at the top.
"That's their job - that's
the role they play for us," said
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins.
"Their job is to set the table. ... I
thought they did an outstanding
job."
The pair combined to hit
15-for-23 with 12 runs, three
times Penn State's output for
the weekend. That set the table
for sophomore shortstop Sierra
Romero, giving the Nittany
Lions no place to put Michigan's
elite slugger.
"Any time either
(Sappingfield) or I get on base, I
think that justsparks our offense

game changer when the leadoff
batter gets on, and it just pumps
up the team."

and ended the weekend 6-for-

JAMES COLLER/Daily
Senior Lyndsay Doyle sparked Michigan's bats by getting on base early, helping the bigger sluggers drive home runs.

Driesenga, who tied Penn State's
weekend score by herself with a
grand slam in the second game.
Still, just six of the 39 hits
Michigan cranked out went for
extra bases. The Wolverines
instead fed off of 12 walks and
five errors to get around the
bases.
Hutchins got nearly everyone
into action, with seldom-
used senior outfielders Katie
Luetkens and Brandi Virgil each
hitting their first home runs of
the season. Every time Michigan
put the ball in play, it seemed to
amount to something.
"Not every batter needs to go
up there swinging for the fences
- we just need to make good
contact," Doyle said. "Our goal is
to get one base at a time and just
keep stringing those along."
Penn State, on the other
hand, struggled to muster
anything. Junior left-hander
Haylie Wagner held the Nittany
Lions without a base runner in
the first game until a seventh-

inning, one-out walk. She lost
the no-hitter to a single by the
next batter.
"I didn't realize until after it
was broken up and somebody
said something," Wagner said.
But Wagner had another
chance at a no-hitter the next
day, heading into the fifth inning
with a 12-0 lead. With weather
threatening, Hutchins said
Wagner may have been trying to
end the game quickly rather than
have it postponed until Sunday.
Still, after two strikeouts, a
walk and a hit batter, Wagner
was one out away from finishing
off a five-inning no-hitter and
leaving Penn State scoreless on
the weekend. The Nittany Lions,
however, showed signs of life,
stringing together three two-out
hits and four runs.
"I don't make too much of it,"
Hutchins said. "She pitched very
well all weekend and had one
bad inning."
Junior right-hander Sara
Driesenga then relieved Wagner

and got the final out, securing
the five-inning victory. With her
performance, Wagner moved to
17-0 in 19 appearances with a
1.00 earned-run average.
Driesenga also pitched the
second game, the most lopsided
of all of them.
Michigan tallied at least
four runs in all five innings and
garnered 16 hits and seven walks.
"What can often happen is
when it's a tight game and if we're
going up and down the order and
no one's hitting, people start
feeling the pressure," Hutchins
said. "It's a lot easier to hit with
no perceived pressure."
Michigan managed just six
runs in the series opener, but the
game never got close because
Wagner was nearly perfect.
"We really weren't relentless
in that game," Hutchins said.
"But we pitched well and held up
our lead."
The bats came alive later
that night, and Wagner and
Driesenga took care of the rest.
