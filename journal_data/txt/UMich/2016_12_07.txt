The University of Michigan 

will receive about $100,000 in 
state grant funding to combat 
sexual assault, according to a 
Tuesday press release.

This is the second year 

funding from Gov. Rick Snyder 
(R) and first lady Sue Snyder’s 
initiative to end sexual assault 
on 
college 
campuses 
in 

Michigan has been allocated 
to the University. The funding 
will be split between all 
three University campuses, 
with $53,505 for the Ann 
Arbor campus, $9,840 for 
UM-Dearborn and $34,150 for 
UM-Flint.

The 
Snyders 
announced 

the continuation of the state 
grant in October at the second 
annual 
“Inform. 
Empower. 

Prevent. Let’s End Campus 
Sexual Assault” summit at 
the North Campus Research 
Complex.

Last year, the Ann Arbor 

campus 
received 
$20,003, 

which it used for the Raise 
the 
Barprogram 
— 
an 

initiative 
in 
which 
local 

bar 
employees 
participated 

in 
bystander 
intervention 

training 
to 
increase 
their 

knowledge of sexual assault 
and provide them with the 
skills to intervene in high-risk 
situations. This year’s $53,505 
will go toward creating an 

About 
150 
students 

gathered in the Pendleton 
Room of the Michigan Union 
Monday night for a mental 
health speak out sponsored 
by all four councils of the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

Greek life. During the event, 
students 
shared 
personal 

stories 
regarding 
mental 

health and discussed how to 
manage stress during finals 
week.

Students who did not want 

to speak out publicly were also 
able to submit their stories 
through an anonymous portal 
for event leaders to read.

The speak out was the first 

event centered around mental 
health University Greek life 
has held — similar to the 
Sexual 
Assault 
Prevention 

and Awareness Center and 
Panhellenic 
Association’s 

first speak out last February 
regarding 
sexual 
assault 

— with the goal of raising 
awareness 
about 
mental 

health 
and 
allowing 
for 

open 
discussions 
among 

students and faculty. Students 
discussed 
a 
number 
of 

concerns such as issues with 
depression, anxiety and body 
image.

Due to the nature of the 

event, The Michigan Daily 
was asked not to record or 
photograph 
speakers 
who 

shared personal anecdotes.

LSA senior Lexi Wung, 

Panhellenic 
Association 

Executive Board president, 
said before the event that on 
a personal level, she felt it was 
important to host a speak out.

“Specifically 
in 
our 

community, I feel like (mental 
health) is so stigmatized, 
especially 
in 
Greek 
life,” 

Wung said. “Having mental 
concerns, 
having 
mental 

health problems, is seen as 

debilitating, 
is 
seen 
as 

something that you want to 
hide … We think that there 
hasn’t been enough done on 
campus to start (breaking 
down the stigma).”

Other 
organizations 
on 

campus have held mental 
health speak outs in recent 
years 
to 
emphasize 
the 

importance 
of 
self-care 

and 
destigmatize 
mental 

health, such as LSA Student 

Government 
and 
the 

University’s chapter of Active 
Minds. In addition, University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

has spoken about increasing 
mental 
health 
resources 

on 
campus 
alongside 
the 

student-launched Help CAPS 
Catch Up campaign.

Many of these events came 

in response to the 2014-2015

Growing up in Pittsburgh

watching 
horror 
movies 

such as “Frankenstein” and 
“Godzilla.”

Coleman’s 
relationship 

with the media throughout 
her childhood, including the 
portrayal of Black people on 
television 
shows, 
inspired 

her interest in studying the

time, she grew increasingly 
uncomfortable

A group of students led by Music, Theatre & Dance Prof. Ashley Lucas, leader of the Latino/a Theatre for Social Change program, present a performance about the 
Flint water crisis at a Central Student Government meeting in the Michigan Union Tuesday

A group of students from School 

of Music, Theatre & Dance Prof. 
Ashley Lucas’s Latino/a theater 
program for social change came 
to Central Student Government’s 
Tuesday meeting to perform a 

short skit on the Flint water crisis, 
urging the student body to create a 
resolution to help install long-term 
institutional plans to help the city.

Flint water was contaminated 

with lead after the city switched 
to the Flint River as a water source 
in April 2014 without introducing 
the necessary chemicals to stop 
the water from corroding the pipes 

and letting lead leach into the 
water, sparking significant health 
concerns for residents and gaining 
national attention and outcry. 
Recently, a judge has mandated 
that the state must provide 395,000 
bottles of water to the city.

The skit took a spin on “A 

Christmas Carol,” following an 
average concerned but uninvolved 

student who was taken to the city 
of Flint during its time of crisis. The 
story touched upon the lack of clean 
water for children, and charged 
that there is a lack of response 
from Michigan’s government. The 
play also emphasized the lack of 
available washing water for high 
schools and retirement homes.

Sen. Debbie Dingell (D–Mich.) 

announced Thursday that the 

University of Michigan will be given 

a $2,470,600 grant from the U.S. 

Department of Transportation’s 

University Transportation 

Centers to research connected and 

automated vehicles.

The grant will establish 

a Center for Connected and 

Automated Transportation on 

campus as well as on efforts to 

investigate vehicle safety and 

congestion management through 

the usage of connected vehicle 

systems.

The funding will also be used by 

the Ann Arbor Connected Vehicle 

Test Environment, an initiative by 

the University’s Transportation 

Research Institute that implements 

connected vehicles and 

infrastructure around Ann Arbor, 

and Mcity, an off-roadway testing 

facility for automated vehicles.

“We are at the cusp of a major 

transformation in the auto industry, 

and the University of Michigan is 

leading the way in the research and 

development of new technologies 

that will shape the future of 

mobility,” Dingell said in a press 

release. “This grant will give U-M 

new tools to address the critical 

transportation challenges facing 

our nation by promoting connected 

and autonomous technology 

research and education.”

According to the press release, 

the research will include observing 

characteristics of traffic flow and 

how to incorporate connected 

and automated vehicles, as well 

as regular vehicles. Additionally, 

transportation infrastructure 

design and planning for CAVs, 

cybersecurity management of CAVs 

and impacts of CAVs on a global 

scale in terms of safety, efficiency 

and environmental effects will be 

implemented.

The grant given to the 

University is one of 35 five-

year grants awarded through 

the government’s University 

Transportation Centers program. 

The University will be the leader of 

a group of colleges and universities 

on the project, including 

Washtenaw Community College, 

Purdue University and others.

“I’m also pleased that 

Washtenaw Community College 

will be a partner in this project, as 

they will bring a unique perspective 

and skill set to this important effort. 

This partnership demonstrates 

the level of expertise the state of 

Michigan has in this critical field,” 

Dingell said.

This is not the first time in the 

past few months the University has 

received funding for autonomous 

vehicle research. In August, the 

Toyota Research Institute gave 

$22 million for autonomous vehicle 

research at the University. The 

Toyota funding and research is 

overseen by UM Associate Profs. 

Ryan Eustice and Ed Olson, and 

Toyota is also a founding partner 

of the University’s Mobility 

Transformation Center, which 

operates Mcity.

In a September interview 

with the Daily, Olson said the 

funding being given to research on 

autonomous vehicles is crucial for 

the scientific realm to get off the 

ground.

“The problems that we are 

working to solve are the best kind: 

really hard,” he said. “Fundamental 

research is needed to solve these 

problems and so TRI is investing 

in both internal research and 

university partnerships like the one 

at UM.”

BRIEF: REP. DINGELL ANNOUNCES TRANSPORTATION GRANT

For 
Michigan 
hockey 

players, 
the 
academic 

expectations 
are 
lain 
out 

during 
the 
recruitment 

process.

Coach Red Berenson doesn’t 

take the subject lightly. If 
his 
athletes 
are 
becoming 

Wolverines on the ice, then 
they’re going to have to put in 
the work in the classroom as 
well.

“I’ve made it a priority that 

school 
is 
important,” 
said 

Berenson. “You’re not coming 
here just to play hockey, 
you’re coming here to go to 
school and I want you to get 
something out of this. This is 
a great school, and you’ve got 
to work hard to do well, and if 
you’re not interested in school, 

don’t come here.

“So we tell them that in 

the recruiting part of it, and 
then when they get here, they 
realize we mean it. Over the 
years, I have sat players out 
from practices or games or 
given them a week off and said, 
‘Stay away until you get school 
straightened out.’ Whatever 
it takes so they know to me, 
school comes first.”

Michigan’s 
players 
face 

the ultimate challenge, then 
— not only do they have to 
balance the hectic and intense 
schedule of being a Big Ten 
athlete, but they also need 
to 
take 
their 
schoolwork 

seriously. And at a school like 
Michigan, that schoolwork can 
be exceptionally demanding.

Junior 
defenseman 
Sam 

Piazza can attest to this. As 
a student of the College of 
Engineering, Piazza has to 

take classes based heavily 
around 
math 
and 
science. 

He is also a student majoring 
in 
mechanical 
engineering, 

which means that he has 
to participate in labs with 
other students. These labs 
give students the project of 
building something, and are 
expected 
to 
complete 
the 

projects within their groups.

“I always grew up liking 

math and science, and when 
I applied here, I just applied 
to 
engineering, 
because 
I 

thought that if I didn’t like it, 
I could transfer out of it more 
easily than transferring into 
it,” Piazza said. “I ended up 
liking the intro classes and 
chose 
mechanical 
partially 

because they had the most 
class availability time-wise, 
but I do enjoy it. It’s working 
out really nicely.”

When Piazza was a freshman 

and sophomore, it was easier to 
balance his time between his 
academic schedule and hockey. 
This year, though, Piazza has 
found himself on the ice much 
more than he had his freshman 
and sophomore years, even 
notching the game-winning 
goal for the Wolverines’ first 
away game at Ferris State. So 
far this year, he’s tallied four 
assists and three goals.

There are days such as 

Tuesday where Piazza can 
be found in the lab for time 
frames as long as four hours 
before hockey practice. And on 
Fridays and Saturdays, Piazza 
can be found on the ice, battling 
for pucks and attempting to 
generate good opportunities 
for his teammates.

Despite the stark differences 

of these situations, though, 
Piazza 
has 
handled 
these 

responsibilities with maturity 
and dedication, and that is 
exactly what Berenson expects 
out of his players.

“He’s a good example of 

what we’re talking about, a 

As Michigan hockey player, Piazza 
balances athletics and engineering

Services report outlining the 
top 
five 
student-identified 

mental health concerns as 
anxiety, 
depression, 
self-

esteem, 
academic 
problems 

and relationship difficulties. 
Additionally, the report found a 
17-percent increase in demand 
for counseling services that 
year. 
Nationwide, 
mental 

health is an onging concern 
on college campuses — in a 
2011 survey from the American 
College Health Association, 
30 percent of college students 
have reported at some point in 
the previous year feeling “so 
depressed that it was difficult 
to 
function,” 
and 
overall, 

students are seeking treatment 
for mental health concerns at 
higher and higher numbers, 
according to the Center for 
Collegiate Mental Health. 

Numerous student speakers 

at the event acknowledged the 
support of CAPS. Todd Sevig, 
director of CAPS, wrote in 
an email interview Monday 
night that he was glad to see 
students taking initiative in the 
ongoing campus discussions 
surrounding mental health. 

“I am so appreciative of 

the Greek System for holding 
this event,” Sevig wrote. “It’s 
critical for our campus to 
hear and understand the real 
stories of how mental health 
plays out in students’ day-to-
day lives. This first-ever event 
is also a wonderful example 
of how student empowerment 
can help change lives and help 
our campus culture be 100% 
supportive of mental health.”

Kinesiology 
senior 
Joe 

Filipiak, the Interfraternity 
Council judicial vice president 
and lead organizer of the 
event, said before the event he 
thought it was crucial to hold 
a speak out regarding mental 
health, 
especially 
before 

exams.

“(Mental health) is a big 

issue, not only within the 
Greek 
community, 
but 
on 

college campuses in general,” 
Filipiak said. “We see how 
it affects our friends, we see 
how it affects our fraternity 
brothers, sorority sisters, et 
cetera, and we figured it was 
time to start changing the 
stigma and speak out about it.”

Filipiak 
also 
noted 
how 

widespread 
mental 
health 

issues 
are, 
particularly 

in 
a 
demanding 
academic 

environment.

“It really affects everyone, 

especially at a school like 
Michigan where there’s so 
much 
emphasis 
being 
put 

on your grades or academic 
performance, 
being 
the 

Leaders 
and 
the 
Best,” 

Filipiak said. “So that finals 
talk can really stress people 
out, so we wanted to give 
people 
a 
reminder 
before 

they really hunker down and 
start studying that there is a 
community here if they are 
experiencing any of that stress, 
any of that depression.”

Wung 
emphasized 
the 

difficulty of sharing stories 
in public, saying she used her 
own experiences to contribute 
to the planning of the event.

“I had so many health 

concerns coming to college and 
especially during my first term 
as president; I really got to my 
lowest point and having this 
community around me is what 
really made the difference 
between being here today and 
being a different person here 
today,” Wung said.

Both Filipiak and Wung said 

they hope to hold future events 
similar to Monday’s speak out 
to continue to bring attention 
to depression, anxiety and 
other mental health concerns 
on campus.

Noire: Blacks in American 
Horror Films from 1890s to 
Present,” published in 2011, 
she 
provides 
insight 
and 

analysis of a unique genre: 
Black horror.

Horror Noire focuses on 

Black horror films, which is 
distinct 
from 
mainstream 

horror films that may have 
African-American supporting 
or lead actors. Coleman said 
Black 
horror 
films 
often 

convey a political message to 
the audience.

“It is almost like a protest 

movement genre where they 
are talking back to society 
about social ills,” Coleman 
said. “You will see Black horror 
responses to police brutality 
and mass incarceration.”

One of Coleman’s favorite 

horror films, “Night of the 
Living Dead,” was set in her 
hometown of Pittsburgh and 
produced by George Romero 
in 1968.

“What is interesting about 

‘Night of the Living Dead’ is 
that it is a mainstream film 
that has a Black hero,” Coleman 
said. “The ending of the film is 
very dramatic and speaks to a 

lot of the police brutalities that 
Blacks were facing.”

After 
personally 
viewing 

and analyzing hundreds of 
horror films for her book, 
Coleman 
also 
found 
that 

Black death in Black horror 
films differed from that in 
mainstream 
horror 
films. 

Coleman 
said 
typically 
it 

provides a political message, 
like police brutality, while in 
mainstream 
films, 
African 

Americans often take the role 
of the monster’s victim.

“There is a kind of disruption 

of the typical representations 
of Blacks in horror films, 
that they are essentially meat 
for some monster,” Coleman 
said. “They are much more 
than that; they are smart and 
resourceful and that isn’t the 
case in typical horror films.”

She pointed to “Jurassic 

Park” 
as 
an 
example 
of 

how African Americans are 
portrayed in most mainstream 
horror films.

“If 
you 
have 
this 
big, 

loathsome dinosaur monster, 
how do you show how wickedly 
bad it is?” Coleman said. “You 
introduce a Black character, 
and if the monster can beat 
that figure, then it must be 
badass.”

Having spent years studying 

African popular culture and 
media studies, Coleman said 
she has also found that there 
have been significant changes 
in how African Americans 
are 
being 
represented 
on 

television, pointing to current 
shows on network television, 
such 
as 
“Scandal” 
and 

“Blackish,” 
feature 
African 

Americans as leading actors. 
She said other media viewing 
sites such as Netflix and 
Youtube have the potential 
to provide a deeper look into 
African American life.

“Outside 
of 
network 

television, you see the most 
innovative 
presentations 
of 

Blackness that dig deep into 
Black life and culture in an 
interesting 
way,” 
Coleman 

said.

In 
class, 
Coleman 
said, 

she makes it a priority to 
challenge students to think 
critically about the content 
they are viewing on the screen, 
emphasizing the human lives 
behind the camera.

“I 
want 
them 
to 
be 

thoughtful about the things 
that they contribute to media 
or to discourses about Black 
life,” Coleman said. “I want 
people to be more thoughtful 
in how they represent who I 
am.”

said.

The 
lecture 
began 
by 

introducing 
the 
inspiration 

for the subject of the book 
and its cover, an image of an 
upside-down tree. Pfeffer said 
while watching an interview 
between Oprah Winfrey and 
Thomas Beatie, a transgender 
male who became pregnant, 
she 
was 
intrigued 
by 
the 

intense audience reactions that 
ranged from shock and anger 
to acceptance and curiosity 
toward his relationship with 
his wife.

She 
said 
she 
was 
first 

attracted to the cover image 
of “Queering Families,” an 
upside-down, 
barren 
tree, 

because it was simultaneously 
recognizable and ambiguous, 
reflecting the complexity of the 
relationships the book features.

“Were those barren branches 

or life giving roots?” Pfeffer 
asked. “Are those blue clouds 
floating in the sky or a water 
source 
towards 
which 
the 

roots 
are 
stretching? 
And 

the branches or roots where 
someone might see barrenness, 
Halloween or death, others 
might 
see 
something 
more 

arterial. A pathway. A place 
where vital sustenance and 
growth can happen.”

The rest of the discussion 

was based off one specific 
chapter 
from 
“Queering 

Families,” 
titled 
“Partners 

Negotiating Bodies, Sexuality, 
and Intimacy.”

“(The chapter) really details 

sexuality, bodies and intimacy 
in the context of cis women’s 
partnerships with transgender 
men,” Pfeffer said.

It discusses five different 

themes: 
trans 
sexual 

embodiments, destabilizing the 
penis, new queer lexicons and 
sexual imageries, penetrating 
myths 
and 
realities, 
and 

monogamy. 
During 
her 

remarks, 
Pfeffer 
introduced 

each of these themes and 
used information from the 
interviews 
in 
“Queering 

Families” to provide context.

For 
example, 
Pfeffer 

discussed 
trans 
sexual 

embodiments and addressed 
the 
varying 
positions 
on 

bottom surgery within the 
relationships 
of 
cisgender 

women and transgender males. 
She said she found that many 
cisgender 
women 
reported 

being 
disinterested 
in 
the 

surgery due to the expense and 
risk.

In 
regard 
to 
monogamy, 

Pfeffer found just two of her 
interviewees 
were 
raising 

children with their transgender 
partners 
at 
the 
time 
the 

interviews 
were 
conducted. 

For younger queer cis women, 
forming an open relationship 
with a trans partner was more 
common.

“For 
younger, 
queer-

identified 
cisgender 
women 

in particular, forming an open 
relationship 
structure 
with 

a trans partner may serve as 
one way in which this group 
engages in social innovation,” 
Pfeffer said.

She discussed the fourth 

theme, penetrating myths and 
realities, by explaining what 
she called a broadening sexual 
language and practices that 
have occurred as trans people 
become more visible in society.

“Trans 
people 
and 
their 

partners 
are 
carving 
out 

innovative 
and 
generative 

pathways 
full 
of 
pleasure 

and joy that are nuanced, 
complicated 
and 
deserving 

of broader and more focused 
sociologic attention,” Pfeffer 
said.

Several students at the event 

declined to discuss the lecture 
with Daily reporters.

After 
their 
performance, 

the actors held a Q&A with the 
assembly in which they discussed 
possible ideas for collaboration and 
plans for a resolution. The group 
included seven students, including 
LSA senior Ramiro Alvarez, who 
said the group was interested in 
allocating a certain amount of 
supplies to selected high schools 
or groups. This, he said, is so they 
can focus in on long-term solutions. 
One solution he suggested was to 
compete against Michigan State 
University, mimicking the success 
of Blood Battle, to collect the 
supplies.

Over 
the 
duration 
of 
the 

crisis, CSG discussed ways to 
have campus-wide efforts toaid 
Flint residents by reaching out to 
fundraising groups, supporting 
organizations helping Flint and 
creating 
a 
partnership 
with 

UM-Flint’s student government.

Alvarez also said he believed 

CSG could represent the students 
interested in helping Flint to 
the Board of Regents. The CSG 
president speaks before the Board 
at each Regents meeting.

“Right now, you can step out 

and get a drink of water from the 
water fountain,” Alvarez said. 
“But 45 minutes away from here, 
people can’t do that. And we know 
that it is a lot to just drop on you 
all but … we are here to work with 
CSG in any capacity that you can 
think of. Do something long term.”

Public Policy junior Nadine 

Jawad suggested the group could 
focus on elementary schools, 
since the water crisis has been 
associated with severe health 
risks 
among 
young 
children. 

The group agreed, detailing the 

developmental issues appearing in 
children from Flint, which include 
lower IQ scores, developmental 
delays and behavioral issues. Lead 
contamination in young children 
is considered incredibly hard to 
reverse once it has occurred.

Other 
effects 
from 
the 

contaminated water include teeth 
damage, severe bone pain and 
cancer.

Not everyone on the assembly 

was in favor of the performance. 
Rackham student Andrew Snow, 
CSG’s Ethics Committee vice 
chair, took fault with the skit’s 
portrayal of Snyder. The group 
satirized Snyder’s response to the 
Flint crisis as unprepared and 
uninterested in the city’s crisis, 
interested in only votes and his 
image.

Over the past year, Snyder has 

attempted to demonstrate ways 
in which Flint can trust their 
filters by vowing to drink from 
Flint for a month in April. He and 
the state government have drawn 
significant 
criticism 
because 

of the slow response and lack 
of oversight from government 
officials from the Michigan state 
government.

Snow noted that Snyder’s 

daughter attends the University 
and said she does not deserve to 
see the caricature of her father.

The group disagreed, stating 

their form of acting allowed 
them to channel their worries 
about the crisis in productive 
ways.

“This is a way of us processing 

the disillusionment, sadness and 
grief that comes with the little 
support that isn’t there,” Alvarez 
said.

I

ncoming regent Ron Weiser 
is, objectively, a very nice 
man. 
When I had the 

opportunity to interview him 
several weeks ago, just 
before the election on 
Nov. 8, I was struck 
by 
how 
incredibly 

personable 
and 

well-spoken he was. 
His experience as a 
diplomat was apparent; 
he carried himself like 
a statesman, but did 
so with a smile on 
his face and a joke or 
anecdote at the ready. 
He was excited at the 
opportunity to engage one-on-one 
with a student and gave a great 
interview. However, none of that 
changes the fact that I find him to 
be categorically and utterly wrong 
on a laundry list of issues. And 
I’m not alone. But he’s not wrong 
about absolutely everything.

Just after the election, he 

made thoroughly inappropriate 
comments at a post-election 
analysis 
panel 
hosted 
by 

the Ford School of Public 
Policy. He talked about the 
fact that he often feels “very 
unwelcome on campus” as 
a Republican, ignoring the 
thousands of students who 
were petrified to walk to class 
on Nov. 9 because of their 
skin color, religion or sexual 
orientation 
— 
a 
statement 

that seems particularly whiny 
and clueless in consideration 
of the on-campus incident in 
which someone would feel 
legitimately 
unwelcome 
a 

few days later. He hid behind 
his platform as an “economic 
conservative” when explaining 
his support for Trump — 
because a vote for hate and 
indecency is OK if it’s good for 
your wallet — and talked about 
how he found it “offensive” 
that people could not separate 
his own political views from 
aspects of “Trumpism” that he 
finds despicable. This is from a 
member of the Trump Victory 
Committee, 
a 
fundraising 

committee for the Republican 
National Committee, and a 
man who will serve as finance 
vice chair for the president-
elect’s inauguration.

Simply put, Ron Weiser is 

out of touch with the student 
body on a lot of issues, with one 
colossal exception: tuition. And 

if you’re an out-of-
state student like me, 
his election presents 
an opportunity in an 
incredibly 
divided 

political 
climate 

to 
get 
something 

important done.

Why? 
Well 
it’s 

important to note 
first and foremost 
that 
Michiganders 

can get extremely 
protective 
when 

it comes to tuition. Every 
single candidate for the board, 
Democrat 
and 
Republican 

alike, campaigned on the need 
to keep in-state tuition low for 
Michigan families. This makes 
sense: Regents are elected by 
Michigan families. But it’s also 
problematic.

State 
funding 
for 
higher 

education took a big hit in 2011 
due to budget cuts by Gov. 
Rick Snyder. Although with 
moderate increases levels have 
returned to what they were in 
2011, the cut was poorly timed. 
The University of Michigan is 
spending like crazy: Renovating 
buildings, 
constructing 
new 

ones, continuing to rise in 
higher 
education 
rankings 

and hiring big-name coaches 
all at the same time is a costly 
exercise. And for the most part, 
it has been on the backs of out-
of-state students, most of whom 
pay very high tuition.

I know what you’re thinking. 

Michigan families have been 
paying taxes to the state, and 
therefore into the University, 
for years, and so it’s fair that 
out-of-staters pay more. And I 
knew what I was getting myself 
into from the start. You’re right. 
But three times more and rising? 
With tuition hikes every year 
since I stepped foot on campus? 
Is that still fair?

And here’s where Ron Weiser 

comes in. In his platform, 
he posits that you “wouldn’t 
purchase 
a 
home 
without 

knowing your cost over the term 
of your loan, and you shouldn’t 
go to school without knowing the 

cost of your degree.” As regent, 
Weiser wants to guarantee that 
the price tag on your degree 
when you walk into orientation is 
the same price tag you see when 
you walk at graduation. For all 
students, 
and 
especially 
for 

middle-class out-of-staters who 
don’t qualify for financial aid — 
look left and right, you’re likely 
sitting next to one of them — that 
would be a huge and important 
step in the fight for affordable 
higher education.

Tuition at the University 

has increased by 91 percent 
since 2003 — not accounting for 
inflation — to the tune of about 
$26,000 for out-of-state students. 
Slowly 
but 
surely, 
middle-

class students from around the 
country are being priced out 
of going here with rising costs, 
too little financial aid and a 
refusal to raise in-state tuition 
by any substantial amount. By 
the way, these are students 
who contribute greatly to our 
university community, whose 
test scores and tuition and theses 
are helping to improve the school 
we love — contributions that 
benefit future Michiganders, by 
the way.

So, while I’m more than 

happy to stand in opposition 
to Ron Weiser on any number 
of issues — to protest in the 
Diag or change my Facebook 
profile picture or walk out of 
class if necessary — it’s time to 
recognize that when it comes to 
tuition, Weiser could help make 
real progress. A regent with his 
position on tuition is rare. Out-
of-staters, this guy, as flawed 
and out of touch as he may be, is 
pretty much our only hope that 
tuition isn’t $70,000 by 2025. 
Or, we can turn our nose up at 
him because of the R next to his 
name on the ballot and watch 
as a college degree becomes a 
privilege of the uber-wealthy 
and the abyss that is student 
debt grows deeper and deeper 
every year. Instead, I choose 
as a starting point the fact that 
Ron Weiser is, objectively, a very 
nice man.

JASON ROWLAND | COLUMN
Combatting the sophomore slump
B

elieve it or not, we 
columnists 
have 
a 

topic 
we’re 
supposed 

to explore over the course of 
the semester. Perhaps harder 
to believe, my topic 
is not race relations 
on campus or the 
presidential election, 
but 
“the 
first-year 

experience.” 
So 

maybe it’s fitting that 
after a semester of 
not writing about my 
assigned topic, my 
final column of the 
semester is also not 
about the first-year 
experience, but about combating 
the dreaded sophomore slump.

The 
mechanisms 
behind 

this slump are simple: During 
freshman year, everything is 
new and everyone is focused on 
ensuring an easy transition into 
college life. However, at the end 
of the year, everything that was 
once exciting becomes normal 
and routine. This phenomenon 
is actually pretty common. It 
happened to me when I received 
my first phone, my first laptop 
and, apparently, enrolled in 
college. Living in a new dorm 
with new friends became living 
in a germ-infested dungeon, a 
fun game against an in-state 
rival became a soul-crushing 
loss that will never be forgotten 
and the beauty of snow in 
the Law Quad became just 
something that interrupted my 
walk to class.

All of this seems to be 

compounded 
by 
the 
fact 

that during sophomore year, 
classes 
get 
tougher 
while 

extracurricular 
demands 

begin to pile up. “What are you 
majoring in?” replaces “How do 
you like school?” and everyone 
wants to know where you’re 
interning over the summer. As 
if that wasn’t enough, the school 
treats us sophomores like an 
elderly dog — once young and 
adored but now old and unloved 
— compared to the treatment we 
received upon entering campus.

To be fair, this is far from being 

just a University of Michigan 

phenomenon. Every publication 
from The New York Times to 
USA Today has written about 
the slump at colleges across the 
country. Yet nothing seems to be 

getting done to avoid 
it. 
While 
joining 

new clubs or making 
new 
friends 
seem 

like easy solutions, 
most students’ top 
priorities lie in the 
more 
challenging 

and 
demanding 

classroom. As a result, 
time that was spent 
during freshman year 
exploring 
interests 

or talking to new people is now 
spent doing section readings or 
studying for exams.

At its root, the sophomore 

slump is the disappointment 
felt by a student who can’t 
quite 
capture 
the 
same 

excitement they felt during 
their first year. Based on my 
experience, the cure for this, 
then, is not necessarily joining 
new organizations (though, as 
long as you’re not overbooked, 
that certainly doesn’t hurt). 
The best way to combat the 
sophomore slump is simply to 
adjust your expectations and 
then balance accordingly.

First, it’s important to know 

that almost nothing we do will 
recapture all of the excitement 
of freshman year. However, 
colleges should do a better job 
at conveying that each year is 
supposed to be very different 
from the last. To survive in the 
21st century, it’s essential that 
we can adapt to constant change. 
The same holds true for making 
it through our college careers. 
If sophomore year was just like 
freshman year, it’d be a sign that 
progress through the “college 
experience” is not occurring. 
This is because sophomores 
are held to a higher academic 
standard 
and 
have 
higher 

expectations to meet than their 
freshman 
counterparts. 
By 

now, after a year of experience 
of classes at the university 
level, 
we’re 
expected 
to 

understand how school works. 

By this point, we’re working 
toward our majors and taking 
fewer distribution classes. By 
sophomore year, our shift in 
mindset from being here to enjoy 
ourselves to being here to work 
toward a better future should 
be well underway. Furthermore, 
it’s important to realize that this 
shift isn’t bad — despite what 
films and TV shows, replete 
with partying and little actual 
studying, have to say about the 
college experience.

With these new expectations, 

a delicate balance must be 
made so personal growth is 
still possible. During freshman 
year, filled with less-intensive 
introductory courses and, as 
a result, more free time, it’s 
possible to dedicate almost all of 
your time outside the classroom 
to exploring new interests and 
people. In later years, however, 
course work begins to eat up 
more and more of your waking 
hours. Achieving a balance, 
where class assignments reign 
as the top priority but you’re still 
finding time for extracurricular 
pursuits, should be the goal 
for sophomore students — not 
a futile pursuit of excitement 
from years before.

As for finding this perfect 

balance, I’m still struggling. 
If I spend too much time in 
the library, I stop enjoying my 
time in college; too much time 
hanging out with friends leads 
to stress around due dates over 
the course of the semester 
and 
during 
exam 
week. 

However, just knowing that 
this uncertainty is acceptable, 
even if it leads to feelings I 
didn’t experience during my 
freshman year, is my way to 
keep the sophomore slump at 
bay. So, first-year students, live 
it up while you still can. And to 
sophomores and up: Know that 
the freshman experience won’t 
last forever, but keep in mind 
that it’s not supposed to, and 
you’ll be more than OK.

Trump endangers First Amendment rights
F

reedom of the press, 
freedom 
of 
speech 

and 
the 
freedom 
of 

assembly — the foundation of 
American democracy is in the 
First 
Amendment. 

Be you a Democrat, 
a 
Republican 
or 

something 
in 

between, relative to 
most people in the 
world, you’re free to 
express your opinion 
in any way you see 
fit. This notion is 
so deeply ingrained 
in the DNA of our 
nation that it’s almost 
unfathomable to consider that 
there are others who are deprived 
of these freedoms. Yet, despite 
the fact that these fundamental 
rights are written into the 
United 
States’ 
Constitution, 

which all but guarantees that its 
citizens will forever have these 
rights, we must never forget that 
the suppression of free speech 
will always be a very real threat 
to democracy.

That is exactly why I continue 

to find Donald Trump’s recent 
statements 
so 
troubling. 

Throughout the course of the 
past year, Trump has repeatedly 
expressed his desire to weaken 
the power of our most vital right 
and has received an alarmingly 
low degree of criticism for his 
comments. Most recently, he 
claimed that if anyone were to 
burn the American flag, “there 
must be consequences — perhaps 
loss of citizenship or year in jail!”

Putting aside the fact that 

threatening to expatriate U.S. 
citizens is a deeply disturbing 
sentiment 
in 
itself, 
many 

Americans will claim that a law 
preventing this type of behavior 
would have no effect on their daily 
lives, as they would never dream of 
desecrating the flag. Yet the truth 
is that regardless of if you agree 
with the action of flag-burning 
itself, a law of this nature would 
set a very dangerous precedent, 
as the Supreme Court has deemed 

the act a form of symbolic speech 
protected by the First Amendment 
on multiple occasions.

If a U.S. citizen could be 

arrested or even stripped of 

their citizenship for 
an act that is clearly 
protected under the 
First Amendment, an 
all-out war on free 
speech could begin. 
Once 
flag-burning 

is outlawed, what is 
to stop the president 
from 
punishing 

U.S. 
citizens 
for 

engaging 
in 
other 

acts of protest? Could 

someone be arrested for simply 
marching in the streets? Is it so 
ludicrous to suggest that under 
these circumstances, one could 
be arrested for speaking ill of the 
president in any way? While I 
understand that these examples 
are extreme in nature, they are 
important to mention, as this is 
the type of slippery slope that a 
law of this nature would create.

Many will say that treating 

Trump’s statement with this 
degree of seriousness is an 
overreaction, and I would agree 
if it had been made in a vacuum. 
Yet we must remember that this 
decree is coming from the same 
man who once urged his own 
supporters to “knock the crap 
out of” protesters at his rallies. 
His actions and statements 
have continued to build upon 
one another over the course 
of the past year, and it is clear 
that an anti-First Amendment 
sentiment has emerged from 
Trump’s corner.

For a man who has vehemently 

protested 
the 
political 

correctness 
and 
sensitivity 

of modern American society, 
Trump has made it quite clear 
that any negative comments 
hurled in his direction will not 
be tolerated. He has repeatedly 
insulted reporters who have 
criticized him or asked him 
tough questions and even banned 
many news organizations from 

attending his events for fear of 
negative coverage. Perhaps most 
concerning of all, he has claimed 
on multiple occasions that he 
will “open up our libel laws” 
so it will be much easier to sue 
reporters and news outlets for 
publishing negative stories.

Many 
have 
realized 
the 

danger that Trump’s statements 
represent, and the Committee 
to Protect Journalists, a non-
partisan 
committee 
that 

advocates 
for 
the 
rights 
of 

journalists throughout the world, 
has even gone as far as to issue 
a statement declaring Trump 
“an unprecedented threat to the 
rights of journalists.”

But despite these troubling 

signs there has been very little 
discussion of Trump’s potential 
crusade 
against 
the 
most 

fundamental rights that we as 
Americans enjoy. While many are 
quick to erupt in furious protest 
when even the slightest degree of 
gun control is proposed, claiming 
that such limitations violate their 
Second Amendment rights, they 
seem content to let the preceding 
amendment slip by the wayside.

Perhaps Trump’s statements 

haven’t been taken seriously 
enough 
because 
of 
how 

ubiquitous the First Amendment 
is in our society. Most of us have 
lived our entire lives without 
ever having to fear reprisal for 
speaking our minds, and as a 
result we cannot imagine society 
any other way. Yet ignoring 
dangerous 
statements 
simply 

because we do not perceive them 
as plausible is a disservice to 
our way of life and a sentiment 
that has emerged with alarming 
frequency 
since 
Trump’s 

election. 
These 
statements 

cannot be ignored; the American 
people must utilize the very 
rights that Trump threatens and 
speak out against these threats 
to our freedom.

The 
modern 
moviegoer 

is 
obsessive. 
The 
modern 

moviegoer is informed. The 
modern moviegoer is a different 
beast 
than 
any 
previous 

generation of audiences, for the 
simple reason that the modern 
viewer is armed with the 
internet. We are collectively 
better 
informed 
than 
ever 

before about the production 
processes behind our favorite 
movies, 
the 
filmographies 

of the directors and actors, 
the credentials of the writers 
and most controversially, the 
political implications of the 
movies themselves.

We do not accept the notion 

that movies are unchangeable, 
inarguable 
culminations 
of 

imagination. Instead, we pore 
over casting rumors, director 
interviews and teaser trailers, 
and so create highly specific 
expectations for every newly 
released film. We hope that 
the new Superman movie cuts 
down the bleak tone of the first 
one, because it wasn’t very 
effective. Or we pray the latest 
Jennifer Lawrence/David O. 
Russell collaboration isn’t just 
another three-hour shouting 
match. Or we place bets on 
how long it’ll take for the new 
James Bond movie to have a 
weird, kind of creepy, almost 
predatory 
sexual 
encounter 

(about 50 minutes in is my best 
guess).

Look 
at 
the 
popularity 

of 
YouTube 
channels 
like 

CinemaSins, Screen Junkies, 
Cracked, 
WatchMojo 
and 

Cinefix. Look at the discussions 
on Twitter and Tumblr about 
the merits of this or that movie, 
the 
seemingly 
endless 
top 

ten lists and bottom ten lists, 
the million think pieces that 
accompany every new release. 
“Why [insert beloved children’s 
movie] is Secretly Horrifying.” 
“Top Ten Reasons Why You’re 
A Bad Person and Should Feel 
Bad For Liking the Reboot 
More Than The Original.” We 
take this information and bust 
it out at dinner, in the car on 
the way to the movie we’re 
about to see, because we feel 
we’ve learned something about 
the media we consume, and we 

want to share that knowledge.

The 
phrase 
“everyone’s 

a critic” is usually used to 
describe 
people’s 
tendency 

to be nitpicky or mean, but 
when I say it here, I mean it 
in the literal sense. By virtue 
of the Internet, everyone can 
serve the role of the critic, 
placing movies in their cultural 
context, poking holes in their 
plots or character arcs, making 
fun of the stilted dialogue or 
lazy CGI.

In a lot of ways, this is a 

really 
good 
thing. 
Online 

campaigns have led to more 
diversity in film casting, and a 
wider appreciation of films that 
may have slipped under the 
critical and audience radar on 
release. And it’s wonderful that 
more attention is being paid to 
the effect entertainment has 
on us, especially the popcorn 
flicks. Because it’s never “just 
a movie.” Movies are both 
products of and contributors to 
our culture. They’re important 
and they’re special. It’s good 
that people pay attention.

But there is a clear downside, 

and that is that we have become 
a more demanding audience. 
We insist stories be structured 
in exactly the way we want 
them to be, and if they are not, 
then the movie doesn’t even 
deserve to exist.

Think of the articles that list 

every way in which a movie’s 
content 
or 
presentation 
is 

morally problematic, written 
in such a way that it seems 
the writer is simply revealing 
the truth and anyone who 
may have liked the movie is 
actually a monster. Or the fact 
that there is an entire genre of 
YouTube videos now dedicated 
to reviewing not just the trailer 
of a film, but the teaser trailer 
as well, as if that is a perfect 
barometer of whether or not the 
movie should be watched at all. 

Many like to think of this 

as a liberal issue of “political 
correctness gone mad.” And 
yes, there is no denying the 
nastiness of the callout culture 
so prevalent on Tumblr and 
Twitter, but this is a problem 
that spans every ideology on the 
political spectrum. No one is 
immune.

Look at the awful backlash 

against 
the 
“Ghostbusters” 

remake. Or the uproar about the 

apparently politically motivated 
decision to cast a woman in 
the lead of “Star Wars: Rogue 
One.” Or the seething hatred 
directed by so-called men’s 
rights activists at “Mad Max: 
Fury Road.”

It’s anyone’s right to hate 

whatever they want to hate or 
not see any movie they don’t 
want to see. First Amendment 
rights, yada yada yada. But to 
the modern moviegoer, content 
not delivered in exactly the way 
we want is punishable by online 
harassment and death threats. 
We leak the home addresses, 
phone numbers and workplaces 
of people on Twitter who said 
something stupid so that the 
harassment and death threats 
can live on beyond the confines 
of the Internet. We think that 
our opinions are law, and if we 
believe a movie is too offensive 
to exist, then by God, that must 
mean it’s true.

But at the end of the day, we 

are an audience. Yes, we have 
opinions, and yes, we absolutely 
have the right to express them. 
We might even be pretty well 
informed about production and 
analysis and how character 
arcs 
should 
be 
structured 

and all that. But it’s when we 
start positioning our opinions 
(and yes, they are absolutely 
opinions) of a movie as absolute 
fact that we have a problem. We 
can’t say definitively whether 
a movie is deeply offensive 
and has no value. In truth, 
no one can, because movies 
aren’t 
definitive 
statements 

of fact and intent, dispensing 
information like a textbook. 
They’re stories from which we 
extract and interpret meaning. 
And meaning is malleable and 
dependent on the person who is 
doing the interpreting.

Of 
course 
movies 
are 

political, and of course their 
messages resonate deeply with 
audiences. 
Understanding 

them 
and 
analyzing 
their 

effects is important. But we, 
the modern viewers, have got 
to stop with the entitlement, 
with the nastiness, with the 
online screaming matches that 
never end. We have to be a 
better audience than this. And I 
think we can be. I think we can 
save ourselves from becoming 
the cultural equivalent of a 
YouTube comments section.

The toxicity of internet film culture

Perhaps best known for the 

smash hit single “All of Me” 

and his high-profile marriage 
to Sport Illustrated model, 
hilarious tweeter and chef, 
Chrissy Teigen, John Legend’s 
fifth studio album release, 
Darkness and Light, does not 

disappoint.

Featuring 12 sexy tracks 

with guest appearances from 
Chance the Rapper, Miguel and 
Brittany Howard, Legend puts 
his sensually rich vocals on full 

GOOD MUSIC

“Yep, that’s me.”
John Legend continues soul-pop 
hot streak with ‘Darkness and Light’

Legend creates album where sequencing and flow still matters

display.

The 
three 
most 
distinct 

songs on the album happen to 
be the three tracks featuring 
guest 
vocalists; 
“Penthouse 

Floor,” “Darkness 
and Light” and 
“Overload” 
each 

showcases 
a 

slightly different 
sound 
that 

Legend 
fails 
to 

incorporate in the 
rest of the album.

“Penthouse 

Floor,” featuring 
Chance the Rapper, starts off 
with a tropical Jason Mraz, 
“I’m Yours” feel to it, but 
gradually moves into what feels 
like a gospel spell. Chance the 
Rapper enters the track halfway 
through with a robust choir 
backing him up, creating a good 
vibes only hit.

Immediately following the 

staccato beats of “Penthouse 
Floor,” “Darkness and Light” 

swirls jazz and soul feels into a 
sensually melodic smooth duet 
between Legend and Brittany 
Howard, her soaring vocals 
impossible to ignore.

Miguel’s 

cameo 
comes 

via 
“Overload,” 

another 
soul-

heavy track on the 
album that makes 
excellent use of 
the 
saxophone 

to cast the mood 
as 
melancholy. 

Juxtaposed with 

the slow, mellow “Overload,” 
Legend amps up the beat in 
“Love Me Now,” a jam with 
great beats, soaring vocals and 
unique instrumentation that 
demonstrates Legend’s innate 
ability to meld soul with pop 
in a way that’s both artful yet 
marketable to the masses — a 
necessary evil in the music 
industry today.

The remaining tracks on 

Darkness and Light are all 
great; I could listen to each one 
several times and not tire of it. 
However, I don’t think I would 
be able to differentiate one 
song from the next. With each 
track featuring a similar beat, 
rhythm and instrumentation 
set-up, it becomes difficult to 
separate the songs from one 
another. However, that isn’t 
necessarily a bad thing. With 
pop music, it’s unreasonable 
to expect an artist to produce 
a cohesive album that dually 
features stylistically distinct 
songs — and John Legend 
went the route of producing 
a great album. Each track is 
pleasant to listen to on its own 
and individually contributes 
to the creation of cohesive 
and high-quality album; two 
components that many artists 
fail to achieve in the fast-paced, 
market-driven 
environment 

dominating the modern music 
industry.

DANIELLE IMMERMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Dear Victoria’s Secret,
Hope all is well. Business is 

booming, I hear. You’re likely 
very busy at the moment, but 
allow me to take a moment of 
your time. All I want is to make 
you aware of one thing: It is 2016.

Adriana Lima is still bad (in 

the good way). Popular Twitter 
accounts still post photos of your 
products captioned “goals.” The 
woman with the unidentifiable 
accent 
still 
narrates 
your 

commercials. And you’re still 
making billions off of your own 
discrimination.

Wake up, Victoria’s Secret.
This is not a rant in opposition 

of skinny women. This is not a 
condemnation of white girls. No, 
this is me begging you to not only 
to recognize the diversity of your 
audience, but to fully embrace it 
for the first time in your history.

I’m not sure what I can 

contribute to the body diversity 
conversation that has not already 
been said. I’ll just tell you not 
to forget that you’re one of the 
only popular lingerie companies 
that has yet to introduce a plus-
sized line, or even bras with 
a cup size larger than a triple 
D. Meanwhile, according to 
Business Insider, the plus-size 
industry is worth $20.4 billion. 
Sure, you’d have to make some 
changes to your patterns to 
accommodate this market. What 
a burden such innovation would 
be! I don’t care what excuses 
you give, your fashion show is 
yet another reminder that you 
are nixing an entire consumer 
demographic in the name of a 
tired ideal.

One more note about body 

image: despite what your fashion 
show’s 
behind-the-scenes 

coverage claims, working out is 
not going to make me look like 
an “angel”. It will make me feel 
great (read: endorphins), but it 
will not make me any less of a 
5’3 teenager with a pear-shaped 
build. Stop trying to make me 
think that my body is incorrect 
for functioning in the only way it 
knows how.

Each year, your show includes 

an alarmingly small selection 
of women of color. To make 
matters worse, the few who are 
cast appear to be chosen based 
on their Eurocentric features. 
Of course, there is nothing 
inherently 
harmful 
about 

almond-shaped eyes or button 
noses. What is harmful, however, 
is convincing a generation of girls 
that they are the “wrong” type of 
Black by only featuring models 
whose chocolate complexions 
are offset by their textbook 
white attributes. Of the eight 
Black women in your show this 
year (and the 51 total models), 
only three wore their hair 
naturally. Don’t get me wrong, 
this number is groundbreaking. 
You are improving, and for that 
I thank you. Yet you’d have to 
have your lace-lined panties in 
a twist to believe that there isn’t 
a world full of issues left for you 
to address.

Don’t get me started on 

your buddy-buddy union with 
appropriation. A Chinese dragon 
wrapped around a Swedish 
woman’s body? A consumer-
friendly robe with traditional 
kimono sleeves? I’m not one to 
make mountains out of molehills, 
but there is something to be said 
for a corporation (i.e., you) who 
capitalizes on the blending of 
culturally significant symbols 
and 
commercialized 
lingerie 

year after year. You seem to 
be the only one in this room 
who does not see the elephant. 
You do not acknowledge how 
blatantly wrong this practice is, 
and you’re the most powerful 
one here.

You 
are 
forging 
obvious 

discrimination 
and 
masking 

it with sparkly wings and 
enthusiasm. This generation of 
young women may wear your 

products with pride, but not 
everyone is fooled.

You do not represent the 

millions of girls who crowd 
around 
their 
televisions 
to 

watch your fashion show. While 
they 
live-tweet 
about 
Bella 

Hadid’s “perfect boobs,” you 
are here to remind them that 
no other variation is worthy of 
your catwalk. I’m writing this 
from the back row of an official 
Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show 
viewing party. There is more 
diversity — of race, body type 
and background — in this one 
room than there’s ever been in 
your self-proclaimed “sexiest 
night on television”.

Sexy is confidence, pride and 

ownership of oneself. Though 
I’m sure each of your models 
embodies this ideal, the way 
you present them does not. You 
are asking young women to see 
“sexy” as a binary, as a question 
with a yes or no answer. And 
because your definition of “yes” 
is so narrow in scope, you’ve 
had a hand in convincing a 
vast majority that they are a 
“no”. Your textbook definition 
of sexiness should not be used 
as a tool to shut down other 
interpretations, 
but 
that’s 

exactly how your annual affair 
operates.

I still love lingerie. I admire 

Victoria’s Secret Angels like 
Jasmine Tookes, who use their 
platforms to emphasize the 
significance of self-care. It’s 
you, 
Victoria’s 
Secret, 
who 

angers me. Your yearly fashion 
show has nothing to do with 
the outfits presented. Rather, it 
presents a full package, a signed, 
sealed and delivered paradigm 
to which every viewer should 
aspire. Let’s cut to the chase: 
you have, quite literally, all 
of the potential in the world. 
The global lingerie market is 
practically yours. I cannot say 
whether you will use that power 
for good or for evil, but I do 
know that you are capable of 
both. All I can do is wait, open-
eyed, for your next spectacle.

Best wishes,
Tess Garcia (the one who 

always lies to your employees 
about whether her cup size has 
been measured recently).

HELP WANTED

CHILDISH GAMBINO

This is where we put a humorous cutline of our own devising.

Donald Glover, who grabbed 

the rap name Childish Gambino 
from a Wu-Tang 
name generator, is 
a man constantly 
in crisis.

His has been a 

constant struggle 
to decide who — 
or what exactly — 
Childish Gambino 
is. A graduate of 
the NYU Tisch 
dramatic writing program, his 
career is rooted not in music, 
but in TV and comedy, and that’s 
reflected in the lion’s share of 
his best work. His penchant for 
TV especially has far surpassed 
his other ventures (stand-up, 
dramatic roles) and certainly 
his music, at least in quality.

But more than any of his 

other work, his music has been 
intensely 
personal. 
Culdesac, 

the first mixtape he forward-
ly acknowledges in his music 
career, rightfully inspired moni-
kers of “emo-rap,” less in a com-
plimentary breakthrough way, 
like Kanye’s 808s and Heart-
break, and more in a damn-this-
is-cringeworthy way, like Kid 
Cudi’s Speedin Bullet 2 Heaven.

What made his earliest work 

so unsuccessful was that it too 
couldn’t make up its mind. At 
one moment Gambino would 
criticize the state of rap lyri-
cism, while in the next he would 
lay out such gems as “Now these 
fakes say hey like horse shit,” 
and “My verse is pedophiles on 
the playground.” To brush off 
these major missteps, he tried to 
make himself a special category 
that apparently deserved special 
criteria: he was funny, but he 
could be real. What is real, you 
ask? It’s not really clear, and it’s 
not really clear that Gambino 
knew either. Telling your mind 
can be groundbreaking for some; 
it wasn’t in this case.

To be real for Gambino was 

to boast in a cartoonish voice 
as loudly as possible, and then 
bemoan that everyone didn’t 
agree. And even those ostensi-
bly real moments felt like con-
trived punchlines (“my life’s 
gone pecans”), which could be 
fine if you’re into that kind of 
thing — and can overlook bad 
rapping and even worse writ-
ing — but the production was 
so overweight for the generally 
light and, yes, Childish material 
that the entire thing was grat-
ing. The same applies for his 
first major album Camp, which, 
frankly, deserves less than this 
light brush of a mention, except 
to bring up those early high 
school kids who never really 
liked rap became fascinated 
with the idea of a ‘rapper’ who 
militantly advertised himself 
going to Sufjan concerts (while 
absurdly stating that no other 

rapper listens to indie) but, you 
know, still makes easy dick jokes 
you can rap in the car.

So how in the hell did we get to 

Awaken, My Love!, a funk-heavy 
record that is filled with song 

and vocal inflec-
tion, 
reward-

ingly free of rap 
entirely and, most 
astoundingly, 
actually, 
well, 

good?

Two songs — “I. 

Telegraph 
Ave.” 

and “III. Urn.” — 
from 
Gambino’s 

mixed second album Because 
the Internet offered a glimpse 
of this direction. Both find Gam-
bino experimenting with his 
smooth singing voice and trying 
to spread its applicable length. 
Where it once was pushed into 
corners and felt forgotten on 
hooks, it takes the stage here 
and produces what had, until 
now, been by and far some of his 
best work.

His last release found Gam-

bino coming to this divide head-
first, separating his rapping and 
his singing onto to separate, but 
connected mixtapes. The for-
mer, STN MTN, was delegated 
to Atlanta rap covers, while the 
latter, Kauai, was a breezy and 
original take, improving and 
showcasing the natural voice 
talent he seemingly ignored for 
so long.

In retrospect, that double 

mixtape now feels like a state-
ment of intent. The rapping 
takes the sideline, while the 
true work and production value 
is placed on furthering his vocal 
delivery, carving out his own 
space in the R&B realm.

But even with those hints, 

Awaken, My Love! is a radical 
departure. It requires a major 
realignment of what Gambino 
sounds like, what Gambino 
sings about and the place Gam-
bino comes from. This is espe-
cially true vocally — many of 
the songs use vocal distortion 
or never-before-heard inflec-
tions, and it becomes easy to 
forget this is the same man who 
once made cheesy raps. Open-
ing track “Me and Your Mama” 
is a powerful example of this, 
starting with a lower key, spa-
tial introduction and eventually 
exploding into a choir-assisted 
sermon. Gambino’s voice can 
crack at the edges, but it holds 
strong and grips onto the riv-
eting instrumental, and it’s a 
powerful declaration that this 
album is going to be different 
than anything you’ve come to 
expect from him.

The place of influence for this 

work is also a remarkable shift. 
Where previous works and the 
accompanying 
rapping 
once 

sounded like forced emulations 
of Lil Wayne, Kanye, Drake and 
others, this sound is undeni-
ably rooted in George Clinton’s 
vocal delivery, the sound of the 

Funkadelics 
and 
D’Angelo’s 

croon.

As on his rap work, Childish 

can have a tendency to become 
too rooted in those influences, 
verging on derivative. “Zom-
bies,” one of the album’s weak-
est moments, does precisely 
this. He tries to keep so close 
to Clinton’s unique sound that 
he’s forced to rely on auto-tune 
in a way that doesn’t feel so 
much an addition, but a crutch.

But there are times when 

hyper-altered 
vocals 
feel 

fresh and inventive. “Califor-
nia,” which acts as a marriage 
of Kauai and Gambino’s new 
sound, shimmers and shakes 
with a squeezed inflection by 
Gambino. It’s too funky for 
Margaritaville, but too breezy 
and tropical for purely reviv-
alist ’70s funk. It dances on 
its own island. And the single 
“Redbone,” which finds his 
voice at an unrecognizable, arti-
ficial pitch register (reminis-
cent of Frank Ocean’s “Nikes”), 
is an inescapable earworm and 
serves as a grounding center for 
the album.

Lyrically, the shift in focus 

from quick cartoon rap to 
slower, sparser singing, and 
the expansion of the role of the 
instrumental here mean that 
missteps are simply harder to 
come by. The words are more 
abstract and less open to a sin-
gle interpretation, though when 
they are, the story is clear and 
gripping. “Baby Boy,” which 
deals with Gambino’s new-
found fear as a father, is simple, 
yet powerful: “Don’t take my 
baby boy / Don’t take my pride 
and joy / I hope I stay close, I 
hope I stay close.”

Even the wordless pieces are 

more powerful than any instru-
mental on a Gambino album 
before. The penultimate track 
“The Night Me and Your Mama 
Met,” which features guitar 
work from Gary Clark Jr., is nei-
ther overbearing nor overlong, 
but simply drifts and grows 
toward its conclusion as Clark’s 
guitar whines sweetly. Where 
the interludes in Because the 
Internet were often too heavy 
and left the listener tired, this 
one is refreshing.

Coming off his extremely 

well received, polished TV 
work 
on 
“Atlanta” 
earlier 

this year, Awaken, My Love! 
arrives as another reassertion 
of Donald Glover’s purpose as 
an artist, closing out what is 
undeniably his best creative 
year yet. It seems that in criti-
cism, he worked through his 
crises, appearing out the other 
side more refined, more intel-
ligent and simply more likable, 
those teenage-esque periods of 
poorly articulated angst now 
behind him. What we have now 
is a man who truly lives up to 
the term “multitalented,” and 
whose next move is anyone’s 
guess.

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

For several years, one of the 

most exciting parts of Ann Arbor’s 
literary culture has been the Uni-
versity of Michigan’s Helen Zell 
Writers 
Series. 

Named after Uni-
versity alum Helen 
Zell, who donated 
$50 million to fund 
the program with 
her family’s founda-
tion, the series con-
sists of numerous 
visiting writers and 
poets from around the world com-
ing to read and discuss their work. 
Throughout the course of this aca-
demic year, the series has already 
hosted the writer and poet Colm 
Tóibín, poet Bob Hicok and writer 
China Miéville, among others. But 
on Thursday, the series will pres-
ent an event with an artist far clos-
er to home — the University’s own 
poet and writer Laura Kasischke.

“I’ve been writing all my life,” 

Kasischke said in an interview. 
“Even when I was a kid, I enjoyed 
writing. When I read things I 
appreciated them, but I also had a 
feeling I don’t think everyone had 
where I would feel jealous of good 
writing, and I wanted to do that 
myself.”

As she grew into young adult-

hood, the desire to write led 
Kasischke — a native of Grand 
Rapids — to study creative writ-
ing at the University of Michigan, 
where she also received her MFA. 
Today, she teaches at the Univer-
sity as the Allan Seager Collegiate 
Professor of English Language 
and Literature in the Residential 
College. Writing, once a dream for 
Kasischke, is now a central ele-
ment of her life.

“After writing long enough, 

now it’s just a habit,” Kasischke 
said. “It’s something that I do 
because it’s just become a practice 
in my life, and I don’t really know 
how else I would process my life 
and do with the spare time I have.”

Kasischke, an author and a poet, 

has achieved fame in both areas. 
She has received recognition for 

her work in the form of numerous 
prizes, grants and fellowships, like 
the National Book Critics Circle 
Award and a Guggenheim Fellow-
ship. Her process when approach-
ing the two sides of her work, 
however, differs.

“With poetry, usually I don’t sit 

down thinking to 
myself ‘I’m going to 
write a poem now.’ 
I have a line in my 
head, or an image, 
or an idea that I 
was thinking about 
for a few days, and I 
will write in a jour-
nal and eventually 

come up with some sort of form for 
it,” Kasischke said. “With novels 
it’s different … I usually start more 
with a setting and an atmosphere, 
and I just start writing and I keep 
writing until I find a plot, I figure 
out who these characters are and 
what their problems are and what 
their conflicts are and I just keep 
writing and writing. There were 
a couple of novels that I’ve written 
where I knew from the beginning 
exactly what the plot was or I had 
sketched out a plot, but usually I’m 
figuring out what the novel’s about 
in the process of writing it.”

Kasischke 
explores 
many 

themes throughout her work. 
Often, her poetry revolves around 
aspects and stages of her life, such 
as her marriage, children and 
aging parents.

“If I had to sum up what my fic-

tion is about it’s often … the con-
cerns of domestic life,” Kasischke 
said. “But then there’s also some 
gruesome aspect, usually a mur-
der. Somebody gets killed, or 
there’s a body hidden somewhere. 
I don’t usually start out thinking 
there will be, but that’s just where 
I go, where I tend to work (in) 
crime and horror. I only have one 
novel with anything supernatural 
in it, but I like that sort of atmo-
sphere. One of my favorite writers 
is Shirley Jackson, and my kind of 
ideal is subdued terror.”

During 
Thursday’s 
event, 

Kasischke will be discussing her 
work with the director of the MFA 
Program, Doug Trevor, in a free-
flowing conversational interview.

“The director of the MFA pro-

gram, Doug Trevor, and the MFA 
program have initiated this idea 
of having him interview writers 
on the faculty,” Kasischke said. “I 
know that this year he’s going to 
interview me in December, and in 
the Spring he’s going to interview 
Michael Byers, who’s a fiction 
writer on the faculty … it’s part 
of the Helen Zell Writers Series, 
which often brings writers from 
far and wide, and his idea was to 
have a discussion with a writer 
from campus. And there are a lot 
of us.”

While the Zell Creative Writ-

ers Series, in general, is a won-
derful opportunity for Ann Arbor 
residents to learn more about 
authors and poets from around 
the world, Kasischke said that 
Thursday’s event specifically is 
special because it brings local 
artists and the community closer 
together.

What she hopes to pass on, 

at least in part, Kasischke said, 
are thoughts on the part a writer 
plays in the world, the role an 
author takes in society.

“I’d like to say that it’s to give a 

voice to the concerns of our time 
and our place, to add to a conver-
sation about the experiences of 
being a human being on Earth, in 
any particular time,” Kasischke 
said. “I like the quote by Jack 
Kerouac; he says that ‘literature is 
the way we dead men talk to each 
other.’ Of course now we’d include 
women with that, but I think he 
meant that, in general. I do think 
that we all only live for a short 
period of time, and whatever one 
does with that time — taking pho-
tographs, writing articles, doing 
journalism, writing poetry — is a 
little bit of a way to hopefully, per-
haps (leave) some sort of message 
to those come after us. It would be 
nice to think that it’s really cen-
tral and important to the daily 
lives of the people who are living 
and reading contemporary writ-
ing, but I’m not sure that the role 
of the writer is as important in 
his or her own time as (the work) 
which hopefully lasts will be after 
we’re gone.”

Wolverines move on from crushing loss

Until about 4 p.m. on Nov. 

26, Ryan Glasgow’s final season 
as a Michigan football player 
was at its highest point. The 
Wolverines had a chance to beat 
Ohio State in Columbus that day, 
and if they had, they would have 
kept playing, starting with the 
Big Ten Championship this past 
Saturday.

When Michigan lost on the 

final play of double-overtime a 
few minutes later, its season was 
suddenly altered. The players 
had last week off while the 
coaches were out recruiting, 
with only the bowl game left to 
prepare for.

Somehow, 
the 
Wolverines 

had to move on. So when they 
boarded the bus to return to Ann 
Arbor, Glasgow pulled out his 
iPad and watched the game film. 
He watched it again that night. 
And then he came into the film 
room at Schembechler Hall the 
next day and watched it again.

He estimated that he saw the 

defensive film about eight times 
before Tuesday or Wednesday 
last week.

“That’s a game that will stick 

with me for a while, because 
we’re so close to beating Ohio 
State at the Horseshoe, No. 2 
versus 3, one of the biggest games 
in a long time, and just came up 
short,” Glasgow said.

The sting of the Ohio State 

loss lingered for many players. 
The Buckeyes, too, were off last 
week, but they were coming off a 
win and felt confident about their 
College Football Playoff chances 
at No. 2 in the rankings.

“It’s a tough pill to swallow,” 

Glasgow said. “You can cite all 
the referee controversy you want, 
but we didn’t play well enough 
to take it out of the hands of the 
referees. I’m not partial either 
way, what people are saying 

about it. Can’t really do much 
about it anymore.

“Really disappointing, you go 

five years here, try and prepare as 
hard as you can, 
try 
and 
work 

as hard as you 
can, and to leave 
winless against 
Ohio 
State 
is 

something 
I 

don’t even think 
I’ve 
fathomed 

yet.”

Meanwhile, 

Wisconsin 
and 

Penn State, two 
teams Michigan beat early in 
the season, practiced all week 
and played for the Big Ten title 
Saturday in Indianapolis while 
the Wolverines sat at home.

During the week, the players 

had to find another way to pass 

the time, relieved of the 20 hours 
per week they spend practicing 
during the season. Some studied, 
some watched TV and some 

played games.

“It was weird,” 

said 
senior 

cornerback 
Channing 
Stribling. 
“There’s 
never 

been 
a 
time 

when we’ve been 
off, 
not 
doing 

anything.”

And 
some 

players — such 

as Glasgow, who is taking just 
six credits this semester as a 
fifth-year senior — struggled to 
occupy themselves.

“It’s different — you feel like a 

normal student for a week, kind 
of,” Glasgow said. “But then it 

just gets boring.”

Such is the predicament when 

a team’s season ends abruptly. 
For most of the season, Michigan 
thought it would keep playing 
until the Big Ten Championship. 
Instead, heartbreak had a chance 
to settle in.

Glasgow 
then 
took 
the 

opportunity to talk about the 
opportunity to play Florida State 
in the Orange Bowl on Dec. 30. 
Tuesday, the Wolverines’ dead 
period ended when they went 
back to practice in preparation 
for the bowl game. They have 15 
practices to stay at the level they 
played at for most of the season. 
Then, in a few weeks, Glasgow 
will have one last chance to cap 
his career, add to his NFL Draft 
stock and create some game film 
he’ll enjoy watching on the way 
home.

Season review: 
Running backs

Editor’s 
Note: 
With 
the 

Michigan football team’s 2016 
regular season in the books, 
the Daily looks back at the 
performance of each unit this 
year and looks ahead to the 
future in 2017. In this edition: 
running backs.

Before 
the 
start 
of 
the 

Michigan football team’s 2016 
season, fans wondered which 
running back would emerge 
from the pack. As it turned 
out, no one back consistently 
received the bulk of the carries 
through the first half of the 
season. 
Sophomore 
Karan 

Higdon led in rushing yards in 
some contests, but in others, 
freshman Chris Evans or senior 
De’Veon Smith came out on top.

That changed in the final 

stretch 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 

season. Smith racked up more 
than 100 yards in three Big Ten 
games, becoming Michigan’s 
leading running back with 810 
yards and 10 touchdowns. He 
rushed for the Wolverines’ 
only two touchdowns against 
Indiana 
and 
validated 
his 

position as the lead back.

Though Smith didn’t have a 

signature game against Ohio 
State and posted fewer than 30 
yards in games against Iowa 
and Hawaii, he became the 
Wolverines’ go-to back in most 
dire situations.

Next season the Wolverines 

will need to replace Smith, 
but judging by the talent that 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
has corralled in just two 
seasons, it’s easy to expect 
someone to emerge.

HIGH POINT:

Though it took Smith a couple 

games to find his footing, Evans 
showed 
Michigan 
Stadium 

his potential in his first-ever 
collegiate game. He went off 
for 112 yards, averaging 14 
yards per run and scoring 
two touchdowns against the 
Rainbow Warriors.

Smith 
saved 
his 
best 

performance 
for 
the 

Wolverines’ 
second-to-last 

game of the season. His 158 
yards against the Hoosiers 
were a career best, and they 
also 
saved 
Michigan 
from 

losing two Saturdays in a row. 
As backup quarterback John 
O’Korn struggled to get things 
moving through the air, Smith 
accounted for the Wolverines’ 
only touchdowns. He ripped 
off a 39-yard run in the third 
quarter to put Michigan up 
20-10, allowing the Wolverines 
to enjoy their senior day in the 
snow.

Collectively, Michigan’s best 

rushing effort came in late 

September. 
The 
Wolverines 

rushed 
49 
times 
for 
326 

yards 
against 
the 
Nittany 

Lions, 
scoring 
six 
rushing 

touchdowns in the process. 
Evans, 
Higdon, 
Isaac 
and 

Smith all made it into the end 
zone, helping Michigan to a 
49-10 victory over Penn State.

LOW POINT:

After four running backs 

received 
more 
than 
five 

carries each against Hawaii, 
fans hoped to see a slimmed-
down rotation against Central 
Florida. Instead, carries were 
distributed evenly again, but 
production wasn’t anywhere 
near as high as it was the week 
prior. The Knights controlled 
the Wolverines on the ground 
and held them to 119 rushing 
yards. Smith led Michigan in 
rushing yards, but this time, he 
ran for just 38 yards.

The 
Wolverines’ 
running 

game also screeched to a halt 
against Iowa, which was a bit 
more disastrous. They suffered 
their first loss of the season 
after Iowa held Michigan to 
double-digit 
rushing 
yards. 

The Wolverines averaged a 
lowly 2.8 yards per run in 
Kinnick Stadium, and they 
came up short, 14-13, as the 
receiving corps struggled, too.

THE FUTURE:

Running backs coach Tyrone 

Wheatley has indicated that 
he prefers to use three to four 
backs throughout the season in 
order to keep his players’ legs 
fresh. If his past responses are 
at all indicative of what we’ll 
see in the future, a rotation will 
be used once more.

Though Smith will be lost to 

graduation, freshman Kareem 
Walker could get a chance 
to show what he’s made of 
after redshirting this year. 
Harbaugh kept Walker out 
this season, opting to have him 
focus on academics instead, but 
the highly touted recruit will 
be exciting to watch in 2017.

Evans, who mentioned that 

he wants to put on more weight 
so he can be a bruising back 
like Smith, showed flashes 
of greatness throughout his 
freshman year. He finished just 
behind Smith in rushing yards, 
and it wouldn’t be surprising to 
anyone if he ended up leading 
the unit next season.

Higdon 
and 
Isaac, 
who 

ran for 422 and 417 yards, 
respectively, will round out 
the group. The backs will be 
experienced in 2017, and it’s 
likely that they’ll be counted 
on heavily as Michigan loses 
its top three receivers (Amara 
Darboh, Jake Butt and Jehu 
Chesson) to graduation.

“That’s a game 
that will stick 
with me for 

a while.”

Loss to Xavier exposes flaws in the post

Last Thursday, the Michigan 

women’s basketball team, in 
what appeared to be a matchup 
of equal talents, wiped the floor 
with Georgia Tech in a 92-52 
rout.

The Wolverines had been 

buoyed 
by 
their 
offensive 

prowess in each game prior, but 
for the first time, it seemed like 
the defense could also hold its 
own against a strong offensive 
team.

Michigan was firing on all 

cylinders and doing it consistently 
on its way to a hot 7-1 start.

“It was a pretty good game,” 

said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico after the contest. “We 
kicked their butt. I didn’t think 
that we were going to come in 
here and do that. ... You always 
have to be ready. We always talk 
about the team and not being 
caught up in our individual stuff.”

The 
Wolverines 
especially 

overpowered 
Georgia 
Tech 

with their height, as 6-foot-5 
sophomore center Hallie Thome 
and 5-foot-11 junior forward 
Jillian Dunston controlled the 
paint on both ends, combining 
for 23 points, 17 boards and four 
blocks.

After the Wolverines’ stellar 

showing, they marched onward 
to their fifth consecutive road 
game to take on an unproven 
Xavier team that had yet to face a 
Power Five conference team.

But by the end of Monday’s 

game, 
Michigan’s 
top-10 

offense looked unfamiliar, as 
the Musketeers held it to just 
58 points — 28 at halftime — 
in a 61-58 Xavier victory, just 
four days after the Wolverines’ 
40-point win over the Yellow 
Jackets.

The 
Musketeers’ 
defense 

overwhelmed 
Michigan 
and, 

according to Barnes Arico, they 
didn’t even have to guard every 
player to do it.

“(Xavier) really just keyed 

on certain defenders … (Junior 
guard) Katelynn (Flaherty) and 
Hallie (Thome) more so than 
anybody else. It forced other 
players to step up. That limited us 
from getting any second-chance 
opportunities.”

When Thome was removed 

in the first half due to early 
foul trouble, her absence was 
apparent and Michigan’s outside 
shooting couldn’t make up for it 
like it had in its previous contests. 
Xavier’s offense wasn’t clicking, 
either, but it did what it needed to 
come out on top.

Thome 
and 
Dunston 
put 

up a strikingly different stat 
line against the Musketeers — 
just four points and 11 boards 
combined on 2-for-10 shooting.

Maybe it was the Wolverines’ 

exhausting road game stretch 
to blame, or Xavier’s aggressive 
game plan. Maybe it just wasn’t 
Michigan’s night. But what is 
certain is that the Michigan of 
Monday looked nothing like 
the Michigan of Thursday, and 

that’s because the Wolverines’ 
weaknesses in their small lineup 
were revealed.

This is Michigan’s second 

consecutive 7-2 start, but the 
Wolverines 
will 
try 
not 
to 

replicate last season, when they 
went 4-7 in its next 11 games.

The 
Wolverines 
sit 
108th 

in the NCAA in rebounds per 
game (41.0) and 102nd in blocks 
per 
game 
(4.0). 
Even 
with 

natural shooters like Flaherty 
and 
freshman 
guard 
Kysre 

Gondrezick leading the offense, 
Michigan’s low post presence is 
not contributing at the level of a 
tournament team, and it’s shown 
in both of its losses.

Barnes Arico was reluctant to 

point blame for the loss to Xavier, 
but she knows her team is still yet 
to find a groove.

“I think this game will help 

us to get better,” Barnes Arico 
said. “It definitely exposed some 
things we have to work on, and 
it’ll definitely help us moving 
forward.”

Defense stands tall late against Longhorns

When Texas’ Tevin Mack 

strutted into the locker room 
after hitting a buzzer-beating 
3-pointer, it looked like it was 
happening again.

The Longhorn guard went on 

a 6-0 individual run in the final 
minute of the first half, reducing 
Michigan’s lead to three. Mack 
himself turned what looked 
like a comfortable halftime 
margin for the Wolverines into 
a 
nightmarish 
flashback 
to 

Michigan’s collapse last week 
against Virginia Tech.

“Again, it was the exact same 

type of action that Virginia Tech 
ran against us,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein. “It’s a 
dribble-weave with a guy setting 
a screen to get the guy open, and 
we stopped on it again. It was 
the exact same thing.”

Runs at the end of each half 

against the Hokies ultimately 
cost Michigan an important 
home 
non-conference 
win. 

Beilein even called the defense 
the Wolverines played over 
those two stretches “as bad of 
defense we’re played here, ever.”

But, 
unlike 
last 
week, 

Michigan wasn’t relying on 
its defense to stay out of a hole 
against Texas — it had already 
fallen into one, and it needed its 
defense to get it out.

With four minutes remaining, 

facing a three-point deficit and 
an offense that struggled all 
night to ignite, the Wolverines 
needed stops on defense more 
than ever.

And this time, they delivered.
Michigan held Texas to just 

two points in the final four 
minutes, forcing the Longhorns 

to miss four of their final five 
shots. The Wolverine defense 
finally came through in crunch 
time to give Michigan the 53-50 
win.

“Our kids just sat down and 

guarded,” Beilein said. “Nobody 
could make a shot. It wasn’t a 
pretty offensive game. But we 
got it done when we had to get 
it done.”

Leading Michigan’s defensive 

effort were two players who 

were 
absent 
in 
the 
final 

stretch of the Wolverines’ flop 
against Virginia Tech: redshirt 
sophomore forward DJ Wilson 
and 
sophomore 

forward Moritz 
Wagner. 

Wilson fouled 

out with three 
minutes 
to 
go 

last Wednesday, 
but his presence 
on 
the 
court 

this 
time 
may 

have made the 
difference. 
He 

was the one who 
came up with the steal with 
30 seconds left that set up the 
possession in which Michigan 

took its final lead. All night he 
was menacing Texas’ forwards 
on the boards while getting two 
blocks as well.

But 
Wilson’s 

largest 
contribution 
in crunch time 
may have come 
much 
earlier. 

The forward was 
matched up with 
the 
Longhorns’ 

highly 
touted 

forward Jarrett 
Allen, 
who 

entered Tuesday 

averaging 11 points and seven 
rebounds per game.

Wilson proved to be a difficult 

matchup for Allen much of 
the game. Wilson used his 
wingspan to get over the 6-foot-
11 forward and to force him 
into uncomfortable positions 
competing for rebounds that got 
Allen in trouble.

Allen ultimately fouled out 

with 55 seconds to go. The 
impact of having Allen out 
showed itself on the basket when 
the Wolverines took the lead for 
good, as Wagner grabbed an 
offensive rebound and put away 
the winning basket.

Wagner, too, was essential 

in making big defensive plays 
down the stretch.

The most important one came 

in the final seconds, when the 

forward got up and blocked 
Texas forward Eric Davis Jr.’s 
shot, sealing the victory.

“Moe’s block at the end 

was big,” Beilein said. “Moe’s 
blocking shots really for the 
first time in his life … he’s 
learning when he should leave 
his feet, when he shouldn’t, and 
be a bigger presence at the rim.”

Wagner’s 
defensive 

shortcomings 
have 
plagued 

Michigan often in the past. 
But in crunch time against the 
Longhorns, 
the 
sophomore’s 

improvements protecting the rim 
may have saved the Wolverines 
when they needed to hang onto a 
lead for just a few more moments.

“I thought he’s making major 

steps defensively right now,” said 
Beilein. “I was shocked. When 
I wanted to make a defensive 
substitution at the end and put 
Mark in for Moe, Billy said, ‘No, 
Moe is really hedging the ball 
screen well.’ So we stayed with 
him down the stretch.”

Michigan’s complete second-

half defensive performance set 
the tone for what transpired in 
the final minutes.

The Wolverines played smart 

defense, staying out of foul 
trouble. That led to Michigan 
having multiple fouls to give on 
Texas’s final possession in case 
it needed to use them.

The Longhorns were held 

to just 35 percent shooting in 
the final period and struggled 
to find any sort of answer 
offensively that could help them 
come up with the scores they 
needed.

In the end, it was Wilson 

and 
Wagner’s 
resurgence 

that earned Michigan a non-
conference win it had to have.

“You don’t see us win many 

where 
it’s 
just 
about 
our 

defense,” Beilein said. “It was 
gritty, it was tough in the last 
two 
minutes. 
Everything 
it 

wasn’t in Virginia Tech, the last 
two or three minutes, it was 
tonight.”

Sophomore forward Moritz Wagner made a crucial block down the stretch to help the Michigan men’s basketball team seal a 53-50 win over Texas on Tuesday.

“We got it 

done when we 

had to get it 

done.”

Michigan tops Texas, 53-50, after scare

With just 14 seconds left in 

its Tuesday night game against 
Texas, 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team was desperately 
clinging to a one-point lead. The 
Longhorns had the ball on their 
baseline for a throw-in.

The 
inbounds 
pass 
went 

straight to Texas guard Eric 
Davis Jr., who dribbled the 
ball into the middle and went 
up for what could have been 
the game-winning shot. But 
standing directly in his path 
was sophomore forward Moritz 
Wagner with an impressive 
6-foot-11 frame. Wagner closed 
in on Davis Jr. in a hurry and 

promptly blocked the ball with 
just three ticks left on the clock, 
drawing a deafening roar from 
the Crisler Center crowd as 
Michigan held on for a 53-50 
win.

“I knew that they were trying 

to be aggressive, down one, 
trying to draw a foul or at least 
go to the rim,” Wagner said. “I 
kind of expected that a little bit, 
so I waited until he jumped. … I 
was happy it turned out to be a 
block.”

In the most critical moment of 

the game, Wagner encapsulated 
the defensive effort that the 
Wolverines put forth throughout 
the night in order to dictate the 
run of play and eventually earn 
the victory. 

Against a Texas team known 

for its up-tempo style of play on 
both sides of the ball, Michigan 
knew it would have its work 
cut out for it to keep up with 
the speed and athleticism of its 
opponent.

To match the fast pace of 

Texas, the Wolverines adopted 
an attack-minded defense. They 
went after the Longhorns from 
the opening tip, swarming them 
on every possession. Michigan 
made it tough for them to create 
space and run their offense 
every time they touched the 
ball.

Putting significant pressure 

on them in every man-to-man 
matchup, the Wolverines forced 
10 turnovers in the first half 
alone. Whenever 
a body hit the 
deck to snag a 
bouncing 
ball, 

the jersey that 
turned up with it 
seemed to always 
be maize. 

Outhustling 

Texas all over the 
court, Michigan 
opened 
up 

a 
10-point 

lead in the first half, but a 
buzzer-beating 3-pointer from 
Longhorn guard Tevin Mack 
capped off a six-point run in 
the final minute to reduce the 
Wolverines’ lead to just three.

In the opening five minutes 

of the second half, Texas turned 

the tide on Michigan even 
more. While the Wolverines 
hit a drought, the Longhorns 
made it rain. Scoring 12 points 
to one Wolverine free throw, 
Texas took its first lead of the 

game and forced 
Michigan to call 
a timeout.

With 
the 

Longhorns 
firmly 
putting 

themselves back 
in 
the 
game, 

the 
Wolverines 

picked 
up 
the 

intensity 
that 

had 
served 

them well in the 

game’s opening stanza. With 
a stifling defense that kept it 
neck-and-neck with Texas down 
the stretch, Michigan gave itself 
a chance to win a game in which 
neither offense showed up in a 
major way.

“You don’t see us win many 

(games) where it’s just about 
our defense,” said Michigan 
coach John Beliein. “It was 
gritty, it was tough in the last 
two minutes. …Our kids just sat 
down and guarded, and nobody 
could make a shot. It was not a 
pretty offensive game, but we 
got done what we had to get 
done.”

With Wagner — who finished 

with 15 points, 5 rebounds, 
and that all-important block 
— 
leading 
the 
charge, 
the 

Wolverines 
did 
what 
they 

needed to do in order to win.

“What he shows up as in the 

box score is only a fraction of 
really what he means to this 
team,” said senior guard Duncan 
Robinson. 

“He said multiple times down 

the stretch, just to me, ‘We’re 
going to win this game.’ Having 
that 
reassurance, 
especially 

from a sophomore — he’s mature 
beyond his years.”

THE SEX ISSUE


I

’m the first pair of eyes to proofread and verify the 
next big story, a fiery op-ed or routine coverage of 
a Board of Regents monthly meeting — it’s a big 

responsibility with a quick expiration date. After I make 
the initial copy notes and edits, articles cycle through 
four more editors before they are published that night. 
While ensuring impeccable grammar and adherence to 
Daily style are important, I admit I enjoy fact-checking 
most. This part of the copy editor’s role requires thorough 
yet speedy digging into public records. We confirm 
information on account of Ctrl + F and copy-and-pasting 
because good judgment isn’t enough. As I fact-check, I 
relish the opportunity to discover something new and 
obsess over it. Once I’m done, I pass the writing along 
to the senior copy editor and move onto the next fresh 
article waiting for me.

The job’s necessity of quick turnover shouldn’t bode 

well with my personality because usually I get overly 
attached to people and things — as you can imagine, 
college has not been easy. Here, everything changes 
rapidly in four years. You only get eight semesters to do 
it all: classes, passions and relationships. You lose and 
make friends faster than you can add them on Facebook. 
Your identity is molded before you realize who and what 
nudged you and when. By now, I have grown used to this 
fast-paced life that’s just like the copy desk’s nightly time 
crunch. One Thursday night this year, I read 14 articles 
over the course of three hours, a personal record.

At copy, you do your work well and pass it up to the next 

set of editing eyes. In life, you should care passionately 
and understand when to let go. Call it maturity or 
cynicism, but I am learning to move on and move along 
faster. Goodbyes and hellos are smoothly blurring 
together as the weeks accelerate.

There is one big shock, however, that hurts and still 

lingers: election night 2016.

Though the calendar shows me that we are three weeks 

removed, I cannot forget sitting in the newsroom as the 
polls closed across the country. As a copy editor, I was on 
shift that night and among other articles, edited one of 
two prepared versions of the editorial board’s breaking 
leftside. Then, the results began rolling in and coloring 

in the Electoral College map. As a student of politics 
and policy, I saw everything I had learned implode in 
front of my eyes. As a proud American voting in my first 
presidential election, I was crushed after believing in my 
candidate for nearly 19 months. The next morning, the 
draft editorial I had edited — and dutifully sent along in 
the workflow — was not published. And it never will be.

Gently, the influx of articles to edit and civic duties 

to uphold coaxed me out of my two-week hiatus and 
back into a fervent hurry. On some November night 
years from now, I look forward to recalling this 
pain and smiling at how far it has pushed me 
forward. I’ve got a nice college paper story 
— and now this column — ready for that 
glorious night when we finally elect 
the first woman president.

B Y S O J U N G K I M

the
tangent

ILLUSTRATION BY SHANE ACHENBACH


I

n ninth grade I admitted to my mom that I wasn’t 
getting my period. I was sitting at the head of my 
dining room table, my sister was to my right and my 

mom sat at the other head, directly across from me. Phoebe 
had asked my mom a question about puberty and my mom, 
a very frank veterinarian, gave a complete and detailed 
medical response.

I stared at my breakfast, a bowl of cereal, and blushed. 

I was secretly ashamed that my 11-year-old, stick-thin 
sister was normal and how aware I was that I was not. 
At school my friends all talked about tampons or pads 
and how bad their cramps were and so on. I always felt 
excluded. I had nothing to add to the conversation.

My mom, the smartest and most efficient woman I 

know, sprung into early-preventative action, recognizing 
the signs for a very common Ashkenazi Jewish hormonal 
deficiency. Just a month after I told my mom that not 
only was my period irregular but I hadn’t had it in over 
a year, I wound up in the office of a gynecologist, crying. 
My mom was right, I had polycystic ovarian syndrome.

Essentially, my body produces too much androgen, or 

male hormones. The hormonal imbalance causes weight 
gain, irregular periods, acne, excess hair growth and a 
deeper voice. The best part about PCOS is that controlling 
your weight is the most effective preventative method 
for all the negative symptoms, but that no matter how 
hard you work out or how well you eat, losing weight is 
roughly a million times harder for someone with PCOS 
than someone who doesn’t have PCOS.

But the fun doesn’t stop there! Because of the weight 

gain, women with PCOS have a tendency to be at-risk 
for developing diabetes and, even worse, issues with 
infertility because of the lack of a “regular” hormonal 
cycle. 

I was in ninth grade when I found out that I had to 

start worrying about my fertility as an adult. That I had 
to deal with the reality that I might never be able to even 
have kids, or might have extreme difficulty conceiving. 
That’s an awful feeling, not just because of the crushing 
weight of dealing with the far-off future, but because 
I was different. Let’s be clear, though, I enjoy being 
different in things that I can control. But it’s hard to come 

to terms with being “proud” of a hormonal imbalance.

I used, initially, two magic pills to prevent the common 

side effects of PCOS; birth control and metformin. The 
birth control was used to regulate my periods, and the 
metformin was used to help regulate my weight. The 
catch-22 is that birth control causes weight gain in a lot 
of women. So I was taking birth control to get a period, 
gaining weight because of it and using another pill to 
suppress the effects of the birth control. 

There’s a lot of issues I could cover between ninth 

grade and now, such as the disgusting amount of blood 
draws (needles are not my friend), the shame in not 
feeling as “womanly,” my off-the-chart cortisol levels 
and the decision to stop using birth control. But the main 
issue I had to struggle with was my body image.

I still struggle, as most women do. I love the “body 

positive” movements that have cropped up in the 
progressive world like wildfire, but I don’t identify with 
them. I have a dichotomic conscious, where a part of me 
is so happy with the way I look and the other side just 
sees a body that is deficient. I shouldn’t be overweight, 
I eat well (enough) and I exercise (during the summer 
when school doesn’t consume my life). I make jokes about 
my lifestyle but I completely understand the mechanics 
of personal metabolism after extensive meetings with 
nutritionists and doctors. My body just can’t without a 
complete motivated dedication to changing physically 
through extensive dieting and excessive exercising that 
I don’t have energy for at this point in life.

And I hate that.
I hate the word can’t and I hate that I’m 

“procrastinating” my own health. The reality is that I’m 
heavier than I should be and it scares me. I want children 
one day and I want my own biological children and I 
know I want to be physically pregnant and not depend 
on surrogacy.

Here’s the most important thing, though: I do not use 

PCOS as an excuse for anything I have mentioned in 
this article, I use it as an explanation. That distinction 
between excuse and explanation is very important to 
me. I recognize that to other people struggling with 
life-threatening or altering diagnoses, my “frustrations” 
with PCOS are minimal, and I respect that.

And to answer your question, yes. Yes I did just spend 

an entire article complaining about not getting a regular 
period. But I’m not sorry that I did. I really wish I did 
cramp and bleed and got acne and was moody and it gross 
once a month. But I’m cool with my (sex) hormones. I 
never had a major turning point from hating to accepting 
the diagnosis and ultimately being OK with it, but the 
point is that today, I am.

T

he day after School of Information senior Nicole Zeffer 
watched president-elect Donald Trump win the general 
election on Tuesday, Nov. 8, she placed a call to Univer-

sity Health Services to make an appointment for an IUD con-
sultation.

“It’s upsetting to me because it’s a step in the wrong 

direction, when I thought there would be a step in the right 
direction,” Zeffer said.

IUDs, short for Intrauterine Devices, along with implants, 

comprise the long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) 
category of contraception methods currently available. 
According to the American Congress of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists, IUDs and implants are the most effective form 
of reversible birth control on the market — more than 20 times 
more effective than birth control pills, the patch or the ring. 

However, a study published in 2015 by international 

reproductive health journal Contraception found that just 12 
percent of women were using LARC methods of contraception, 
compared to 41 percent of female family planning providers 
and professionals. 

But in the wake of the election, that might be changing. 

Zeffer is just one of many women across the United States to 
take part in a sudden uptick of research and interest in LARC 
contraception resources following the election of Trump. In 
the hours following the election, Google saw a nationwide 
spike in searches related to IUDs (in addition to upticks in 
donations and interest at Planned Parenthood clinics and 
gynecologists).

This sudden interest in IUDs and implants may be 

explained in part by the uncertain future of President Barack 
Obama’s Affordable Care Act, which included coverage for 
contraception, under a Trump presidency.

The ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, requires 

health insurance companies to cover at least one form of 
birth control from each category of contraception, including 
LARC, hormonal and barrier methods. However, during his 
presidential campaign, Trump has alternately threatened to 
either fully repeal or modify Obamacare, taking that coverage 
away and potentially leaving women with the full cost of an 
IUD, which can range from anywhere between $500 and $900 
dollars.

Concerned over whether their health insurance plans will 

cover contraception as soon as Jan. 20, women on campus 
and throughout the country said they are seeking IUDs and 
implants in particular because, once inserted, they last between 
three and ten years — enough time to last at least one term of a 
Trump administration.

***

Susan Ernst, an obstetrician gynecologist and current chief 

of the Women’s Health Clinic at UHS, says there has been a 
clear increase in interest in IUDs on campus.

Immediately following the election, Ernst, who also works 

in the Medical Center’s gynecology department, said she has 
seen — and continues to see — a sharp increase in demand for 
LARC contraception.

“Since the election, we’ve even had patients coming in and 

saying, ‘You know I’ve really been thinking about doing this for 
the last six months to a year, but now I really want to get it done 
because I’m worried about the coverage,’” Ernst said, adding 
that she’d even seen a patient, who already had an implant 
in her arm that would last for another year, request that she 
have it removed and replaced with a new one because she was 
concerned that in the next year, her insurance would no longer 
cover the implant.

Before the election, Zeffer had been using hormonal birth 

control pills, but she considered switching to an IUD after 

experiencing unwanted side effects from them. After the 
possibility that her health insurance plan would no longer 
cover contraception as soon as January 20, Zeffer made up her 
mind and scheduled a consultation.

“With Trump now being the president of the United States, 

there’s the risk that Obamacare will get repealed at some point, 
and then hormonal birth control pills will become unaffordable 
for me and likely a lot of other people in the U.S.,” Zeffer said.

Ernst said she wasn’t quite sure whether the coverage would 

go away, but noted that the concerns were valid. 

“We don’t know what’s going to happen, but it is a little bit 

concerning,” Ernst said.

Ernst did note one positive in the situation — she said 

she was glad to see more students taking interest in LARC 
contraception because the clinic had already been promoting 
and counseling patients who use their sexual health services 
to consider IUDs and implants long before the election. Health 
care providers in the sexual health clinic favor LARC methods of 
contraception, she said, because they are highly recommended 
for adolescents by major medical organizations such as the 
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. 

IUDs and implants are highly effective and require no 

upkeep from women who use them until they need to be 
removed or replaced — a term healthcare professionals have 
coined “fit and forget,” according to Ernst. She added that 
this aspect of IUDs and implants largely accounts for the 
high efficacy of LARC methods in comparison to other forms 
of birth control. The efficacy of the pill decreases as women 
forget to take it on time, whereas an IUD or implant leaves 
room for little to no human error.

Zeffer said for her, the last aspect was the most important. 
“An IUD is really nice because it’s just one of those things 

that you can put in and most likely not have to worry about,” 
Zeffer said.

Because LARC methods of contraception have been 

increasingly promoted for adolescents by major medical 
organizations, Ernst added, UHS has increased its LARC 
insertion training over the past few years so that there are 
currently six different providers within UHS certified to insert 
implants and IUDs.

“We already increased our capacity with the hope that 

people would pick up or accept this method more readily,” 
Ernst said.

She pointed to a report published in 2014 by the National 

College Health Assessment and the American College 
Health Association that found that just 6 percent of 
undergraduates used LARC methods of contraception at the 
time of last intercourse. Now, she says the number is around 
15 percent, simply by the word of mouth about their safety and 
effectiveness.

However, she also noted that campus would not be immune 

from the possible elimination of contraception from many 
health insurance policies that would come with a repeal of the 
ACA.

Currently, women using the Sexual Health Clinic at UHS 

have all services, such as consultation appointments and STI 
labs related to IUD insertion, fully covered by their tuition. 
Students are only responsible for paying for the IUD, which 
can be several hundreds of dollars if not covered by their 
insurance.

“I’m really disappointed and concerned and hope that, 

as a group, women can make their voices heard to the new 
administration that we think this is something important for 
the health of women,” Ernst said.

She added that this election cycle has affected more than just 

women’s sexual well-being, noting she has seen an increase in 

depression scores among women visiting UHS. 

The University’s Counseling and Psychological Services 

has similarly experienced an increase in stress and anxiety 
surrounding the election. 

“We’ve seen a number of patients who have had higher 

depression scores or even refused to fill out the depression 
scoring sheet because they say they’re so upset about the 
election they just can’t even go there,” Ernst said. “They know 
that it would look like they have depression if they filled it out 
because they’re so upset about the election.”

***

LSA senior Shannon Stone got her IUD from UHS last 

year after she decided hormonal oral contraceptives were not 
for her, mostly because of her busy schedule and a fear that 
she wasn’t taking the pills at the right time. She said she’s 
concerned about the current policy climate surrounding ACA, 
especially because her IUD will be removed one year before 
Trump’s term ends.

Since Trump’s election, she said she’s served as a resource 

for many of her friends who are looking into getting an IUD. 
But while she is glad she decided to get an IUD, it angers her 
that many women are making the decision to get an IUD not 
out of choice but out of fear.

“I love my IUD, but I don’t want someone who doesn’t want 

one to get one,” Stone said. “It’s an option and I’m glad that it’s 
the option that I chose, but it makes me sad that other women 
have to choose it out of necessity or out of fear. I think that 
making decisions about our bodies out of fear is a horrifying 
reality.”

Nursing senior Rachel Cannon obtained her IUD two 

months before the election, mainly because of negative side 
effects she was experiencing as a result of hormones in oral 
contraceptives. She said she felt comfortable undergoing 
the insertion procedure at UHS because she was referred 
to a provider by a friend, who told her this specific provider 
inserted roughly four IUDs per day.

As the reality of a Trump presidency became clear to her 

on election night, she felt relieved that her IUD would last for 
the next 10 years — enough time to cover a two-term Trump 
presidency. However, she said she remains concerned for the 
future of family planning and birth control coverage in the 
United States.

“Taking away free contraception is just going to result in a 

lot of unintended pregnancies, in my opinion,” Cannon said. “I 
think that seems like a logical conclusion to draw, and I feel 
like if it was very expensive or not covered through insurance, 
some people just wouldn’t use birth control at all.”

•••

Reflecting on these past few weeks, Zeffer said although 

she is upset by the sense of urgency she feels to protect herself 
following Trump’s election, she is most frustrated by the fact 
that there are others who don’t have the resources to protect 
themselves.

“As much as it upsets me that I have to watch out for my 

own personal health, it upsets me more that there are so many 
other people out there that aren’t as fortunate as me and that 
are being affected more by this election,” she said, citing those 
who currently may not have health insurance and therefore 
can’t afford an IUD. 

As she prepares to take a step many other women nationwide 

are considering as well, she said she is both comforted and 
bothered by her upcoming IUD consultation appointment at 
UHS. 

“I still have the option of going to my doctor and getting a 

free IUD before Trump becomes president.”

Getting Covered: Before a new White House, women turn to IUDs for security

ever, ever, ever,” creates a common disconnect between 
queer and straight women. In “30 Rock,” after Jack 
assumes Liz to be a lesbian, he sets her up with a woman, 
Gretchen Thomas. After a brief interlude of sexless dat-
ing, Gretchen ends it. Liz tries to negotiate, 
squirming while she says, “Even though I am 
not into the sex stuff, if it helps you … I would 
let you do stuff to me.” Gretchen responds, 
“I can’t be around you anymore,” and leaves. 
When I texted a female friend that I had start-
ed dating a woman, she responded, “omg! What 
are vaginas like?” Instead of telling her to look 
for the answer to such an asinine question in 
her pants, I shut off my phone.

The body is a principle site of power in mod-

ern society. We quantify power and success 
through our bodies — through weight, sexual 
partners, inches of hair, numbers of orgasms. 
But the female body is controlled in different 
ways than the male. The female body is still 
foreign, a misunderstood “other” that localizes 
the anxieties of a misogynistic society. This is 
despite the fact that now more than ever we 
have forums and spaces to discuss the regula-
tion of bodies.

The discussion surrounding the female 

body is reminiscent of Foucault’s rejection of 
the repressive hypothesis in “The History of 
Sexuality.” The hypothesis starts with the Vic-
torian age, as increasing repression developed 
with the rise of capitalism, and ends with the 
prudish Westerner. But Foucault subverts this 
idea, positing that the social restriction placed 
on sex leads to much more discussion of it; 
if you’re told not to think of sex, it’s the first 
thing on your mind. Now, in order to prove that we’re not 
repressed, we have to talk about sex. Constantly.

Luckily, I was raised to communicate well. In my 

house, speech — particularly observant speech — war-
ranted reward. I learned quickly as a child that when I got 
in trouble, I could get out faster with information. I need-
ed to give up either a reason for my misconduct or some 
other form of intelligence. My parents measure the qual-
ity of our relationship based on conversations — the fre-
quency, depth and duration. Whenever I’ve started dating 
someone, I’ve always told my parents. When I speak to 
my mother on the phone, she inevitably asks about them 
— how they are, what they’re studying. But when I started 
dating my girlfriend, those casual conversations never 
took place. They were replaced with a few tense sentenc-
es about once a week that usually ended with my mother 
saying, “I just hope you’re happy.”

This made little to no sense to me — my parents are 

educated liberals. They have showered me with love and 
support in every endeavor. My father cries every time he 
plays me the song he wrote me, called “I Will Walk with 
You.” When I was at the New England Literature Program 
this summer, my mother wrote me at least one letter every 
day for six weeks, declaring in each one how much she 

loved and missed me.

But when I told her my older brother knew who I was 

dating, there was a silence over the phone before she 
responded.

“How did he take it?”
“Fine,” I said.
“I mean, it’s pretty shocking,” she said. “That’s the only 

reason I’m asking.”

He didn’t care. He never liked any of the men I dated 

and always encouraged me to break up with them imme-
diately.

“Well, you’ve dated such unsuitable men,” my mother 

said bluntly while I opened the door to my house, trying 
to hear her over the frat party raging next door. “And the 
only reason you’re dating her is because you haven’t met 
the right man.”

When I said that was hurtful, she apologized but didn’t 

rescind the sentiment, ending with another well inten-
tioned “I just want you to be happy.”

When I went home, I brought it up with my father and 

he looked at me with eyes tired from the spinal surgery 
he’d just had a week earlier.

“Do you want honesty?” he asked. I didn’t. When peo-

ple ask that question, I almost never do.

“Yes, of course.”
“Your mother and I are just concerned because we 

know that you don’t see yourself for all that you really are. 
You’ve always seemed very heterosexual to me,” he said, 
looking at me over his tea and bourbon. He paused to take 
a sip. “And we don’t want you to settle.”

***
I saw my parents as collectively perfect for so long: 

smart, successful, beautiful and endlessly in love. I’ve 
always expected to have a relationship just like theirs, 
and it’s nerve-wracking to be so invested in what seems 

so far from that goal of a heterosexual relationship ending 
in two children and continuous 12-year cycles of female 
German shepherds. Every time I have an uneasy conver-
sation like this with my parents, distance is inserted into 
my relationship. I become more conscious of how I act 
with my girlfriend in public. I wonder how this could be 
right if my parents, the people who know me better than 
anyone, think it’s wrong. Their words create a barrier 
between us, and for a while, I feel like I can barely see her 
through this uncertain haze.

But then when I’m with her, I forget about it and I can 

see clearly again. I laugh, loudly and from deep 
in my chest, after barely smiling all day. The suf-
focating mystery ache on the right side of my 
back goes away. I feel like myself, but a better, 
smarter version of myself that’s not worried 
about the puerile nonsense that I feel otherwise 
consumed by. The first time we had sex, it felt 
like lying in the sun in midsummer, every cell of 
my body warming, relaxing and tensing at once. 
I sleep better in her bed, in the dark of her win-
dowless room, than I have anywhere else for the 
past eight years.

My parents don’t know any of this. I would 

feel uncomfortable bringing it up and they seem 
uncomfortable asking, all parties involved per-
petuating a vicious cycle of silence. My parents 
subscribe, albeit unknowingly, to the “good for 
you, not for me” approach of my Nicki Minaj-
clad friend. They’re very supportive of my gay 
friends and genuinely wish the best for them. 
They didn’t get upset when I unknowingly 
chose “Blue is the Warmest Color” for our movie 
night a few years ago, in what would go down as 
one of the most cringe-worthy three hours and 
seven minutes of my life. But I could talk to my 
parents 14 times a week without discussing my 
romantic relationship.

Foucault contends that there is nothing about 

our sexual behaviors or sexualities themselves 
that reveal our deeper selves. Rather, the con-
structed discourse around sex and sexualities 

that indicate profound truth. Heterosexuality seems to 
be the glue holding together many of my conversations. 
When I’m with friends from home, we only talk about 
relationships. When I had just started dating my last boy-
friend, I tested this by telling a friend about other aspects 
of my life before mentioning that I was dating someone. 
She smacked my arm, ignoring that I was driving on the 
highway.

“Rebecca!” she said. “You have to tell me the important 

stuff first!”

It seems inescapable that heterosexual relationships 

are prioritized and a lack of normalized love stilts con-
versation. This discourse makes my relationship a per-
meable membrane, allowing other opinions to diffuse in, 
making it terrifyingly susceptible. But it also reflects how 
I’ve always felt — that I am made up of everything and 
everyone I know, meaning even when I’m thousands of 
miles away from my parents, they’re always with me. And 
though their doubts put a strain on our relationship, it 
is comforting to have at least parts of them, their good-
ness and intelligent beliefs, ingrained in me. Introducing 
queerness into this dialogue warrants an inevitable awk-
ward pause now, but has the potential to reinvigorate a 
later conversation — or start a new one.

The Problem With Prescriptive Sex Advice

I

’m a very open person.

Most of my friends know there’s something wrong 

if I haven’t divulged every detail about my day. I’ll 

settle down in a dentist’s office waiting room, kibbitz 
over a deli counter, even dish in the bathroom at a gay bar 
about any avenue about my life.

Including sex.
So when I say I’ve never had an orgasm, a topic that 

naturally springs up at bachelorette parties, sleepovers 
and short subway rides, I don’t feel as though it’s an inti-
mate detail that I’ve put into the public sphere. I consider 
it somewhat mechanically, as a bodily function that just 
hasn’t happened to me. I’ve never had my tonsils out 
either and I’ve made it this far in life without it being a 
problem.

As far as Cosmopolitan magazine is concerned, though, 

I’m a freak.

Our culture presents two options: right or wrong sex. 

Sex is either good or bad. If you have good sex, well done 
— you’re “normal.” If you have bad sex, the prognosis 
is dismal. Your partner is broken. Your mind is broken. 
You’re doing it wrong. You’re wrong.

The way we talk about our sex lives is similar to how 

we talk about our car engines. Whether or not it’s work-
ing properly, if it’s your car you have to fix it. Sometimes 
you work on it yourself and sometimes you have people 
work on it for you. And if you’re not obsessed with your 
car and how it runs, you’re in a weird minority. But it’s 
not as simple as that, and you’ll never be able to write a 
foolproof manual for everything that’s right, or wrong, 
about sex.

It doesn’t help that most sex advice circulating in self-

help guides or scrawled in Sharpie on bathroom walls still 
has a gendered slant. In its October issue, Cosmo directly 
addressed situations like mine. In a No-BS Sex Q&A, a 
reader submitted a question about how she’s never had an 
orgasm. She wanted to know if she was defective.

The response was encouraging. Relax, it said, there’s 

nothing wrong with you. A statistic was bandied about 
that just 25 percent of women ages 18 to 25 crossed the 
finish line their last time and it’s totally fine to be outside 
that minority.

Now here’s where it gets interesting: The advice goes 

on about how to remedy the issue by — wait for it — fak-
ing it. Listen here, confused woman of the modern age: 
If you pretend that every second is pure ecstasy, rolling 
around with the guy who smiled at you over his Solo cup 
at 2 in the morning at a co-op party, it will feel like riding 
a mechanical bull on Molly after winning the Super Bowl. 
You know, if he’s properly motivated.

That isn’t to say you shouldn’t consider the needs of 

the person you’re sleeping with. Remember the phrase 
it takes two to tango? But when prescribed sexual advice 
continues the trend — even today — of coming mostly 
from just one perspective, there is an unequal distribu-
tion of praise and the blame.

Take for instance, “The Women,” a 1939 black-and-

white film revolutionary for being the first to star only 
female actors. Though not one man crosses the silver 
screen, powerhouse actresses Joan Crawford, Rosa-
lind Russell and Norma Shearer can talk about nothing 
else. The men in their lives, whether they are ensnaring, 
divorcing or earning them, are the driving force of the 
plot.

“It’s all about men!” the tagline reads, putting down 

men and women alike. The film makes the argument that 
men are helpless when it comes to what they want; they 
are prizes to be won by the women who fight over them. 
The film was remade in 2008, but, considering its 4.9/10 
IMDb score, its male-centric plot fell short of pleasing 
contemporary audiences.

There is a history of media considering a man’s needs 

first, but there’s something cheap about when that rep-
resentation is masquerading as advice for women, by 
women, in the 21st century.

That issue of Cosmo somehow brought the responsibil-

ity of a man’s failing to please back down on the woman. 
In 2016. Like a lightbulb, it clicked: That’s what I’m doing 
wrong. Just fake it till you make it. Or, in this case, till you 
can get someone else to makew it.

I’m not trying to throw magazines like Cosmopolitan 

entirely under the bus here. There are plenty of others 
that insist on a constant barrage of sexual imagery to sell, 
well, pretty much anything. But sex is confusing enough 
without being presented as a pass-or-fail test, especially 
one where you’re making up the answers to get a good 
grade.

As a college student, I’ve always paid close attention to 

the required reading, but when the Cosmo syllabus pres-
ents essential knowledge under titles like “10 Common 
Blow Job Problems and How To Fix Them,” “9 Things 
Guys Secretly Hate About Blow Jobs” or “What Guys Hate 
Most About Every Sex Position,” I’m feeling the negative 
energy. Find out what he hates. Fix the problem.

I don’t really see where I fit when it comes to that 

kind of advice. Because movies, magazines, websites and 
advertisements are pumping us full of these glossy gym-
nastic expectations, sex has no space to be a human act. 
It’s supposedly performed by titans, sex gods and god-
desses who are hairless, poreless and flawless fornicators. 
They always cross the finish line.

I distinctly remember 2011 as a year fraught with unnat-

ural sex scenes. The premiere of films such as “Friends 
with Benefits” and “No Strings Attached” continued the 
parade of unrealistic romps in the sack. Both films seem 
to be making the claim that sex necessarily leads to love. 
Additionally, sex seems to be a breeze so long as you’re 
airbrushed and athletic.

Now this isn’t to say I’m constantly broadcasting my 

situation. I’m not standing at the corner of North Univer-
sity and State wearing a sandwich board disclaiming that 

I’ve never climbed that holy mountain and seen the face 
of God — or rather, screamed his name over and over so it 
echoed down that same proverbial sex mountain.

But what gets me off about the whole thing is how 

uncomfortable, indignant or offended people become by 
this conversation. Sometimes it’s easier to talk about it 
like a car engine. You’ve got a problem, see a mechanic. 
Why discuss it outside of the auto shop?

Without leaving room for individual human respons-

es to a very human action, we’re thrusting an incredibly 
intricate act into a basic format that allows only for praise 
or blame. Forcing a standardized method of experiencing 
pleasure, I feel, is a far greater crime than my inability to 
match it.

Some people think I’m punishing myself by not explor-

ing my sexuality. I’m a prude, I’m limiting myself. That I 
haven’t met the right guy. That I need to handle it myself.

My roommate once said it’s similar to eating a cheese-

cake. If I hadn’t eaten a cheesecake before, I’m not just 
going to stumble upon it accidentally. I have to go out and 
get one for myself.

Prescriptive sex advice usually sucks. I will con-

cede, however, that not all of it is terrible, but thought-
ful answers to difficult questions rarely make headlines. 
Because suggesting people “talk it out” is not sexy sex 
advice. If X, try Y or Z is much easier to sell.

Whether it’s the media’s responsibility, school systems, 

parents or peers to educate on positive sexual awareness 
is another story. But not everyone can tell the fact from 
the fiction, and they’re looking for validation on topics of 
which they’re uncertain. If you’re in the market of dish-
ing out advice, be conscious of how it’s framed. Especially 
when your audience is thirsty for easy answers. If they 
expect their lives to change based on what you can write 
in 100 words or less, that’s a far more interesting com-
ment on our society than I’m capable of making.

My best sex advice? Let me decide what’s working for 

my body. Maybe it’ll happen. Maybe it won’t. Meanwhile, 
I’ll be living my life exactly as I did before — whether 
Cosmopolitan approves or not.
