ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Content warning: sexual 

assault

The 44th annual Take 

Back The Night Ann Arbor 
rally and march took place 
in both the Michigan Union 
ballroom and the streets 
of Ann Arbor Thursday 
evening. 

Take Back The Night is 

a collaboration between 
the 
Ann 
Arbor-based 

organization 
Standing 

Tough 
Against 
Rape 

Society and the student 
organization 
United 

Students 
Against 
Rape 

(USAR). The rally featured 
multiple local officials as 
well as survivors of sexual 
assault who spoke about 
their personal experiences.

The rally was led by 

activist Nicole Denson and 
USAR’s student volunteers. 
It also featured student 
organizations, 
such 
as 

the 
Wolverine 
Support 

Network, Roe v. Rape and 
WORTH, as well as campus 
and local organizations, 
such as DPSS: Special 
Victims 
Unit, 
Planned 

Parenthood of Michigan 
and the Safehouse Center. 

U.S. 
Rep. 
Debbie 

Dingell, D-Mich., shared 
her own experiences with 
gender-based violence and 
recounted instances of gun 
violence in her childhood 
home. She also explained 
a time when a former 
coworker had persistently 
stalked her. 

“Too 
many 
women 

experience 
this,” 

Dingell said. “If you say 
something at work or you 
say you’ve seen it, the Me 
Too movement is taking 
it back for women.We are 
standing up for each other, 
having each person’s back, 
believing 
people. 
You 

need to believe people 

when they come to you.”

Dingell 
also 
said 

she is proud about the 
reinstatement 
of 
the 

Violence Against Women 
Act, which was signed 
into law two weeks ago 
by U.S. President Joe 
Biden after four years of 
rejection from the U.S. 
Senate. She also noted 
the significance of Justice 
Ketanji Brown Jackson’s 
confirmation 
Thursday 

afternoon as a step forward 
for womens’ voices in the 
government.

culture 
change 
she 

experienced coming to 
the University from a 
mixed race household. 

“Coming 
to 

Michigan was a little bit 
of (what) I like to call a 
reverse culture shock,” 
Ojo 
said. 
“I 
didn’t 

think so hard about the 
fact that I was Black 
growing up because it 

wasn’t important to my 
family … So coming to 
Michigan was a little bit 
different because it was 
very much almost my 
entire identity to a lot of 
the people around me.”

In 
2018, 
the 

University received an F 
grade in representation 
of Black students on 
campus from a study 
done by the University 
of Southern California. 
According to Data USA, 
currently 52.2% of the 
student population is 
white and 4.26% of 
students are Black or 
African 
American. 

Additionally, 
Asian 

students make up 13.3% 
of the population, 4.01%

 Diag display 

raises awareness 

of solitary 

confinement 
pitfalls for 

Open MI Door 

campaign

Advocacy efort allows 

passersby to experience confines 

of prison cell, aims to abolish 

isolated incarceration

On 
Tuesday, 

the 
University 
of 

Michigan 
Project 

Outreach collaborated 
with 
Citizens 
For 

Prison 
Reform 
to 

host 
“Solitary: 
The 

Family 
Experience,” 

an event aimed to 
spread awareness and 
support for the Open 
MI Door campaign. 
This 
campaign 
is 

focused 
on 
ending 

solitary 
confinement 

and helping advance 
more safer, therapeutic 
alternatives.

Project Outreach is a 

psychology, service and 
action-based program 
for U-M students. The 
Citizens 
for 
Prison 

Reform is a family-
led 
and 
statewide 

organization 
focused 

on 
assisting 
and 

supporting 
families 

with 
incarcerated 

family 
members 
in 

Michigan.

Lois Pullano, the 

executive 
director 

of 
Citizens 
For 

Prison 
Reform 
and 

the 
coordinator 
for 

the Open MI Door 
campaign, 
discussed 

the purpose of the 
campaign 
and 
the 

greater 
impact 
of 

solitary confinement in 
the state of Michigan. 
Standing on the Diag, 
Pullano 
explained 

to 
passers-by 
the 

harm that those in 
solitary 
confinement 

experience as well its 
impact on families and 
staff members.

“(Solitary 

confinement) not only 
impacts 
the 
person 

that is living in it — so 
it’s very detrimental 
to their mental health, 
often 
even 
their 

physical health — but 
it also impacts all of 
their family members,” 
Pullano 
said. 
“It 

impacts the staff and 
the officers that are 
working inside. When 
people are placed in 
this small of a space, 
it’s where often there 
is greater misuse of 
power.”

n 
January 
2020, 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan 

Rackham Graduate School 
provided 
musicology 

administrators 
with 
a 

department review based, in part, on 
a survey of doctoral students. The 
report revealed multiple concerns of 
musicology faculty engaging in verbal 
abuse, contributing to a “troublesome 
climate and culture” and significantly 
below average graduation rates for 
over two decades. A copy of this 
review has been obtained by The 
Michigan Daily.

“Students indicated a sense of 

belonging … (that) is the lowest of all 
programs in the humanities and the 
arts,” the report said. “Your students 
painted an alarming image of (the) 
program climate.”

The report noted that these scores 

had dropped in the four years since 
Rackham’s previous review in 2015 of 
the musicology department.

Anonymous 
comments 
from 

individual graduate students were 
also included in the report.

“A dozen comments in the open-

ended responses described instances 
of the following: (1) faculty publicly 
calling into question the intellectual 
and scholarly ability of students, 
especially 
female 
students; 
(2) 

faculty openly discussing issues of 
disability, health, and other protected 
personal information of students; 
and, (3) faculty openly insulting and 
demeaning students,” the report said. 

A Daily investigation into the 

musicology department climate found 

numerous previously undisclosed 
allegations of unprofessional conduct 
against musicology professor Louise 
Stein and the department’s current 
chair, James Borders. 

These allegations span from the 

1980s to the present and range from 
grade manipulation to insensitive 
comments 
targeting 
students’ 

socioeconomic backgrounds.

This investigation also found 

the Music, Theatre & Dance School 

and Rackham administrators were 
repeatedly made aware of concerns 
regarding Stein and Borders. It is 
unclear if these administrators have 
taken any actions to address these 
concerns outside of the review.

The investigation conducted by The 

Daily is based on interviews with 16 
current and former students along with 
emails, documents and the internal 
Rackham review. 

In an email to The Daily, Borders 

commented on the allegations against 
him.

“Should the University open an 

investigation, I would cooperate fully,” 
Borders wrote.

Stein also commented on the 

allegations against her in an emailed 
statement to The Daily.

“The allegations … are deeply 

concerning to me because I remain 

dedicated to supporting students and 
promoting their success at all levels,” 
Stein wrote. “If the University decided 
to investigate, I would certainly 
cooperate fully.”

In an email to The Daily, David 

Gier, dean of the Music, Theatre & 
Dance School, explained the actions 
administrators have taken in response 
to the 2020 musicology department 
review. 

“We take very seriously the 

experience of U-M students at SMTD, 
and prioritize climate and culture 
at the school,” Gier wrote. “While 
I cannot comment on personnel 
matters related to faculty and staff, I 
am sharing the steps SMTD has taken 
to address areas of concern outlined by 
the 2020 Rackham Program Review 
of the Musicology Department.”

Gier wrote that the Music, Theatre 

& Dance School’s response to climate 
concerns 
included 
the 
creation 

of a handbook for the musicology 
department and the implementation 
of anti-racism and equity-focused 
training for faculty. 

Gier did not comment on the 

allegations against Stein or Borders.

In interviews with The Daily, 

seven current and former musicology 
students of the 16 total interviews spoke 
of allegations of unprofessional conduct 
against Borders. These students allege 
that his conduct is an open secret 
among students and faculty. 

A former student who enrolled in 

the doctoral program in musicology 
in the early 2010s spoke of Borders’s 
unprofessional conduct at department 
events. The student asked to remain 
anonymous out of fear of professional 
repercussions. In this article, they will 
be referred to as Emma.

Worker shortage, lack of awareness surrounding MCI 

The 
Alzheimer’s 
Association 

released its “2022 Alzheimer’s Disease 

Facts and Figures” report, highlighting 

challenges for the public and healthcare 

professionals 
to 
understand 
mild 

cognitive impairment (MCI), an early 

stage of memory loss or other cognitive 

ability loss. The report also includes 

statistics on Alzheimer’s prevalence, 

mortality, cost of care and dementia care 

workforce in Michigan and nationally.

Alzheimer’s prevalence 

According to the report, 190,000 

Michigan residents aged 65 and older 

had Alzheimer’s in 2020, and the 

estimated number in 2025 will be 

220,000. There were 4,467 statewide 

deaths from Alzheimer’s in 2019.

The report also includes data on the 

dementia-care workforce, suggesting 

a workforce shortage in most states. 

In Michigan, the number of practicing 

geriatricians needs to triple to meet the 

demand in 2050.

Jennifer Lepard, the president 

and CEO of the Michigan chapter of 

the Alzheimer’s Association, said the 

prevalence of Alzheimer’s in Michigan 

is due to the higher proportion of the 

aging population in the state compared 

to other states.

“We tend to use the phrase that the 

greatest risk for Alzheimer’s is aging,” 

Lepard said. “One of the challenges for 

Michigan right now is that Michigan is 

an aging state.”

This year’s report examines the 

public and primary care physicians’ 

(PCPs) 
understanding 
of 
MCI 

nationally. The report finds low public 

awareness of MCI, with fewer than one 

in five Americans familiar with MCI. 

The biggest challenge faced by PCPs is 

difficulty in differentiating MCI from 

normal aging.

Dr. Bruno Giordani, professor of 

psychology in psychiatry, neurology, 

and psychology and associate director 

for Michigan’s Alzheimer’s Disease 

Center, explained that MCI is a middle 

stage of dementia where symptoms 

are not severe enough to have adverse 

effects on daily life. 

“You don’t just turn on the switch 

for Alzheimer’s disease,” Giordani said. 

“What happens is this middle stage 

where somebody begins to develop 

signs and symptoms of problems 

without a marked significant effect on 

daily life and then eventually becomes 

very apparent that somebody has 

problems associated with daily life and 

then that becomes a whole another 

question. So mild cognitive impairment 

is this in between time.”

Giordani also said diagnosing MCI 

is critical because it alerts people of 

the risk of it developing to a more 

severe stage of dementia. According to 

Giordani, not all individuals with MCI 

will develop Alzheimer’s disease, but 

the diagnosis of MCI and biomarkers 

in the brain can suggest a higher risk 

of developing dementia. Biomarkers 

such as beta-amyloid and tau levels in 

cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are strongly 

linked to Alzheimer’s and can be 

detected by PET scan. 

“MCI is important because if 

somebody is just beginning to have 

memory problems, and if you could 

tell if they had amyloid in the brain, 

you could tell there was really a risk,” 

Giordani said. “It’s an alerting stage. It’s 

important to diagnose it so that people 

are aware of it. So they can begin to do 

things.”

Giordani also said research has been 

done to try to find predictors of MCI 

and dementia so people know how to 

reduce the risks. The earlier people can 

catch the predictors, the earlier they can 

intervene. 

“(There are) studies looking at a 

lot of predictive factors and trying to 

intervene early,” Giordani said. “They 

are trying to say, as you get into middle 

age or older age, you should be doing 

cognitive training to keep your brain 

alert. You should check your heart 

disease problems. You should check 

your diabetes … you (should) know to 

eat a better diet and look at the stress … 

But all that research also tells you about 

risk groups that may be there.”

Caregiver burden

According to the report, there are 

466,000 Michigan residents serving 

as unpaid family caregivers and the 

total value of unpaid care is $8.6 

billion. Lepard said caregiver burden 

can cause a significant amount of 

stress emotionally, physically and even 

financially.

“One of the facts that gets glossed 

over a lot is the stress on the caregivers,” 

Lepard said. “This is a 24/7 (job), 

especially in later stages of the disease, 

and the amount of stress that it can cause 

especially when you’re talking about an 

older person living with disease and 

potentially their older spouse … There 

are people that have reduced their hours 

or left the workforce due to (caregiving) 

and that certainly is a financial strain.” 

Giordani also said caregiver burden 

exists for patients with MCI as much 

as for patients with Alzheimer’s and the 

burden often causes caregivers to forget 

about taking care of themselves.

“And then you have the problem of 

creating this large group of people who 

are constantly under stress,” Giordani 

said. “One of the things that contributes 

to the risk of Alzheimer’s disease is 

stress. So you’ve got older unpaid 

people who are in stress, who might 

be depressed themselves trying to deal 

with all this you’re creating another 

whole group of people with potential 

problems. And many caregivers of 

mild cognitive impairment tend to stop 

caring for themselves … This is kind of a 

vicious circle.”

 Whitmer asks MI Supreme Court 
to strike down state’s abortion ban

KATE WEILAND

Daily News Editor

Executive action targets controversial law unilaterally restricting termination as 

Roe v. Wade comes under fire

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer filed 

a 
lawsuit 
Thursday 
challenging 

Michigan’s 1931 ban on abortion. This 

announcement comes in the wake of 

rumors that the U.S. Supreme Court 

may overturn or weaken the 1973 

landmark abortion ruling Roe v. Wade, 

which protects a woman’s liberty to 

choose to have an abortion without 

excessive government intervention.

Michigan’s 1931 abortion ban 

criminalizes the act of providing an 

abortion — including for instances 

of rape or incest — but was rendered 

unconstitutional 
by 
the 
Roe 
v. 

Wade decision. If the Roe v. Wade 

ruling is overturned, the ban will be 

enforceable again. 

According to Whitmer’s lawsuit, 

the ban violates the Due Process 

Clause of the Michigan Constitution, 

which provides a right to privacy 

and bodily autonomy and violates 

Michigan’s Equal Protection Clause. 

Whitmer 
filed 
in 
the 
Oakland 

County Circuit Court and is using her 

executive authority to seek immediate 

intervention by the Michigan Supreme 

Court. Whitmer is the first governor to 

file a lawsuit to protect abortion rights 

since the Supreme Court signaled the 

possibility of overturning Roe v. Wade 

with the appointment of justices Brett 

Cavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

“If Roe is overturned, abortion 

could become illegal in Michigan in 

nearly any circumstance—including in 

cases of rape and incest— and deprive 

Michigan women of the ability to 

make critical health care decisions for 

themselves,” the press release read. 

“This is no longer theoretical: it is 

reality. That’s why I am filing a lawsuit 

and using my executive authority to 

urge the Michigan Supreme Court 

to 
immediately 
resolve 
whether 

Michigan’s state constitution protects 

the right to abortion.”

In an interview with The Michigan 

Daily, Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin 

Gilchrist said abortion rights are 

fundamental rights that all people in 

Michigan should have. 

“The right for women in Michigan 

to make their own choices about their 

healthcare––to have a right to privacy, 

to be empowered, to choose what’s 

right for them, with their family, with 

their healthcare professionals, and 

not with politicians meddling––we 

believe it is a fundamental right here 

in the state of Michigan,” Gilchrist 

said. “The governor is using powers 

that are unique to her, that the voters 

of Michigan bestowed upon her as 

governor of Michigan, to take this 

question all the way to the Michigan 

Supreme Court –– the court that 

settles and interprets state law –– to 

affirm that … the right to an abortion 

exists in the state of Michigan and is 

protected by our state constitution.”

Gilchrist said the right for a 

person to get an abortion is essential 

to economic freedom. According 

to a study from the Washington 

Educational Journal, families with 

infants can be expected to pay $11,000 

a year for childcare and only one in 

six children are eligible for subsidies 

under the federal program.

“We think this is a matter of 

fairness and privacy of choice, and we 

think it’s also a matter of economic 

justice and security,” Gilchrist said. 

“Oftentimes, for many women, the 

choice to have children or not to have 

children is one of the single biggest 

economic decisions they will make 

and it will have a huge and lasting 

economic impact on them for a 

lifetime. To have that choice is to have 

… control over your future and to take 

that choice away is to hamper your 

economic freedom, so we think that 

this is an issue of economic justice as 

much as an issue of access to abortion, 

choice and privacy.”

In the press release, Whitmer said 

banning abortion could also keep 

families in poverty.

“If a woman is forced to continue 

a pregnancy against her will, it can 

have 
devastating 
consequences, 

including keeping families in poverty 

and making it harder for women and 

families to make ends meet,” the press 

release read. 

The lawsuit asks the court to 

recognize the right to abortion as a 

constitutional right under the Due 

Process Clause of the Michigan 

Constitution and asks the court to 

stop the enforcement of the 1931 ban. 

Gilchrist said the goal of the 

lawsuit is to establish the right to 

abortion for Michigan residents so 

that the outcome of Roe v. Wade will 

not impact their rights.

“We hope to affirm and assert that 

women have the right to choice, the 

right to privacy and the right to access 

and have an abortion here in our state, 

and establish this protection at the 

state level so that women in Michigan 

… will have this right regardless of 

what happens with Roe versus Wade,” 

Gilchrist said.

drew hundreds of attendees for the 
culmination of the Ford School’s 
“Democracy in Crisis” series. 
Beginning in March, the series 
hosted four acclaimed journalists 
to speak on threats to democratic 
systems in the U.S. and around the 
world. Applebaum, who specializes 
in geopolitics and the contempo-
rary political landscape, is currently 

a staff writer for The Atlantic.

Barr began the conversation 

asking Applebaum about her book 
“Twilight of Democracy: The 
Seductive Lure of Authoritari-
anism”, which explains how the 
appeal of nationalism and autocracy 
has paved the way for a new wave of 
authoritarianism around the world.

Applebaum 
said 
her 
book 

explored the rise of right-wing 
nationalism in Poland following the 
fall of the Soviet Union as well as a 
similar phenomenon being found 
in countries such as the U.S. and the 
U.K.

“A part of the right (in Poland) 

in particular, had come to different 
conclusions and had decided that 
the system that was built after 1989 
didn’t reflect their views,” Apple-
baum said. “A part of the Repub-
lican Party became disappointed 
with modern America. A part of 
the Tory party became disappoint-
ed with Britain, that the country 

was not what it had been or not 
what they imagined it should be 
… So they attached themselves to 
new, radical political movements.”

Applebaum went on to explain 

how conspiracy theories such as 
birtherism — the belief of any dis-
crediting claims that former U.S. 
President Barack Obama was 
not born a U.S. citizen — have 
fueled public distrust of the gov-
ernment in Western democra-
cies around the world.

“Each country has its differ-

ent version of this: in Poland, 
there was a terrible plane crash 
involving one of the former pres-
idents and a huge set of conspir-
acy theories were built around 
the plane crash,” Applebaum 
said. “The use of conspiracy the-
ory to undermine public trust …

DAILY INVESTIGATION
From Page 1

MichiganDaily.com

Due to the small size of her class, 

Emma asked that the years she 
was enrolled in the program not 
be identified in the investigation. 
According to the 2015 Rackham report, 
the average enrollment cohort between 
2004 and 2014 was four students.

In her first month at the University, 

Emma was warned of Borders’ behavior 
toward graduate students. She was 
specifically advised by another student 
not to speak with him at the annual 
department party hosted at Borders’ 
house.

“(An older student) clearly mapped 

out (the house): This is the layout of 
the kitchen, this is the layout of the 
living room, this is probably where the 
professors will be,” Emma said in an 
interview with The Daily. “‘Don’t hover. 
Don’t try to make small talk. Don’t 
think that this is going to be a pleasant 
experience.’”

At the party, Emma watched Borders 

allegedly approach an Asian student 
to talk to them about “Japanese ritual 
suicide.” She alleged Borders then 
pretended to perform such a suicide. 

“‘So when you want to commit 

suicide, let me know because I can help 
you or I can tell you how to do it,’” Emma 
alleged Borders told a group of students 
at the party.

Another student who attended this 

party 
independently 
corroborated 

Emma’s account.

In an interview with The Daily, 

Alyssa Wells, a current student enrolled 
in the musicology doctoral program, 
recalled her time in fall 2017 as a 
graduate student instructor (GSI) for 
one of Borders’ classes.

On Nov. 1, Wells learned that her 

mother-in-law had been moved into 
hospice care due to a decline in her 
health. She called a fellow GSI and made 
arrangements for them to cover her 

duties before that day’s 8:30 a.m. lecture. 
She emailed Borders at 6:58 a.m.

“I woke this morning to the news 

that my mother-in-law has a very short 
amount of time left. I will not be in 
class today,” Wells wrote. “Right now I 
am still too much in shock to make the 
judgment about whether or not I will be 
in for the rest of the week.”

After a lengthy discussion over 

email about plans for Wells’s sections, 
Borders wrote that Wells had failed 
to communicate clearly in her earlier 
emails. The email exchanges between 
Wells and Borders were obtained by 
The Daily.

“Your 
personal 
situation, 
as 

emotionally challenging as you find 
it, neither reduces your responsibility 
nor the reasonable expectation of clear 
communication so long as you are a UM 
instructor,” Borders wrote to Wells on 
Nov. 3, 2017. 

Borders included Associate Dean 

Jason Corey, one of Wells’ colleagues 
and two musicology professors in his 
response, which Wells told The Daily 
she felt was inappropriate because the 
emails “revealed sensitive personal 
information.”

Wells said she asked other faculty 

members for their advice on how 
to handle Borders’s complaint. In 
one email, a different department 
faculty member suggested that Wells 
“de-escalate.”

“The urgent thing you need to do at 

this point is to de-escalate the situation,” 
the faculty member wrote on Nov. 4 in 
an email obtained by The Daily.

Wells recalled speaking to other 

faculty 
members 
about 
Borders’s 

complaint. They all had the same 
response, Wells claims.

“‘Apologize to him,’” Wells said. 

“Apologize to the person who had tried 
to initiate disciplinary action against me 
in my job because I took a total of four 
days off … that I’m legally entitled to.”

According to the U.S. Department 

of Labor Family and Medical Leave Act 

of 1993, one reason employees can take 
time off is “To care for the employee’s 
spouse, child, or parent who has a 
qualifying serious health condition.”

Wells told The Daily she later met 

with her advisor, who told her that 
Borders had criticized Wells during a 
faculty meeting. 

“(The advisor) said that I had done 

something to make him think that I was 
not serious about the subject … that I had 
abandoned students,” Wells said.

When she returned to teaching after 

Thanksgiving Break, Wells said she 
attempted to apologize to Borders to 
de-escalate the situation. During their 
conversation, Borders allegedly told 
Wells he had complained about her 
in a faculty meeting and spoke for so 
long that two faculty members left the 
meeting.

Tara Browner, a graduate of the 

musicology doctoral program from the 
late 1980s, alleged Borders’s behavior 
created an intimidating and hostile 
classroom environment. 

“It was just awful,” Browner said 

of her time in Borders’s musicology 
bibliography class. “He’s one of these 
people that finds somebody in the class 
and picks on them.”

Another student who took this class 

independently corroborated Browner’s 
characterization of Borders’s classroom 
conduct.

After Browner decided to confront 

Borders about his teaching style, she 
alleged Borders retaliated by lowering 
her grade to a B. She recalled calling 
Borders after the end of the semester to 
discuss her grade.

“‘I gave (the grade) to you because of 

those things you said to me,’” Browner 
alleged Borders said. “‘You had a bad 
attitude.’”

Browner said her grade was allegedly 

raised after that phone call. The 
Daily has obtained a transcript listing 
Browner’s final grade as a B+. 

Eight years later, while attending 

the American Musicological Society 

conference in Baltimore, Browner 
alleged that during dinner one night 
Borders made a toast about her in front 
of some graduate students and faculty.

“(Prof. Borders was) drinking and 

drinking, and people started doing 
toasts,” Browner said. “And he stood 
up and … his toast was, ‘Fuck you, Tara 
Browner.’”

Browner was shocked at Borders’ 

behavior, particularly given that she was 
no longer a University graduate student.

“What was shocking is that he 

treated a professional colleague — me 
— the way he did,” Browner wrote in a 
statement to The Daily.

Browner described feeling a lack of 

support from the musicology faculty 
while she was a student at the University.

“I kept thinking, these people don’t 

care about me at all,” Browner said of the 
department. “They don’t care about my 
career. All I am is I’m something that’s 
here, that’s on a fellowship … they just 
simply do not care about me.”

The Daily’s investigation also found 

numerous allegations of unprofessional 
conduct and academic bullying against 
Professor Louise Stein, a member of 
the musicology department since 1987. 
These allegations come from interviews 
with 14 current and former students of 
the 16 total interviews and a review of 
emails, assignment feedback and other 
documentation.

Stein has previously drawn attention 

in the “Overheard at umich” Facebook 
group for a threatening and aggressive 
email she sent to Information and 
Technology Services in 2016. In an April 
2021 Facebook thread, multiple students 
who took Stein’s courses expressed 
concern over her conduct in class and in 
emails.

The Daily spoke with one of Emma’s 

classmates, 
who 
also 
requested 

anonymity out of fear for professional 
repercussions. In this article, they will 
be referred to as Noah.

In their first semester at the 

University, Noah and Emma enrolled in 

Musicology 509 with Stein. They allege 
that Stein repeatedly offered feedback 
that was insulting and unproductive.

“‘You all write like you have 

absolutely no graduate experience,’” 
Emma alleged Stein said.

Emma took another class with 

Stein the next semester. In this course, 
students began work on their third term 
paper, an essay the department used 
to determine which students would 
continue in the doctoral program. 

Stein returned one of Emma’s papers 

with comments written in all caps and 
red text. The Daily obtained a copy of 
this essay.

“I feel like I can’t breathe when I 

look at those pages,” Emma told The 
Daily. “I can’t tell you how often I cried 
over emails and feedback from her.”

In her application to the University, 

Emma wrote a diversity statement 
in which she described growing up 
below the poverty line. Emma alleged 
Stein repeatedly brought up Emma’s 
statement to critique her work. The 
Daily was not able to independently 
verify that Stein had access to these 
documents.

“She actually weaponized details 

from my diversity statement against 
me,” Emma said.

The Daily obtained an email 

containing feedback on a presentation 
Emma gave in class in which 
Stein 
commented 
on 
Emma’s 

socioeconomic background. 

“Sometimes I have to say things 

that are not as ‘nice’ as the things we 
exchange in social discourse,” Stein 
wrote. “You come from a very different 
world than the one we are training you 
to enter (academe!!).”

Despite her concerns over Stein, 

Emma said she never filed a complaint 
about Stein’s behavior for fear of 
retaliation. 

“(I heard) that other people had 

complained in the past … and that 
nothing had ever happened,” Emma 
said. “All that could really happen was 

that it could make Stein have more 
reason to attack.”

Emma alleged that Stein’s recurring 

negative feedback prevented her from 
progressing on her third-term-paper. 
She was later cut from the doctoral 
candidate 
program 
because 
of 

problems with this paper, according to 
a letter from the department obtained 
by The Daily.

“Two years at Michigan set me 

back five years in my career,” Emma 
said.

Wells is a first-generation college 

student. When she enrolled in one of 
Stein’s classes, she alleged that Stein 
repeatedly made comments about her 
family background. In one instance, 
Wells mentioned that her mother was 
taking a college music appreciation 
course. 

“From that point on, (Stein) 

made comments about me sounding 
unrefined,” Wells alleged.

Wells alleged Stein once held 

the class overtime for 15 minutes to 
criticize how Wells presented a mock 
lesson for a piece based on a Spanish 
poem. One other student, who was in 
the class at the time, independently 
corroborated Wells’s account.

“She held the class over to 

interrogate me about my knowledge 
of Spanish and my inability to translate 
the poem and (to) truly know what 
the poet was getting at … other classes 
were waiting to get in,” Wells said.

In interviews with The Daily, 

multiple 
current 
and 
former 

students alleged Stein created a 
hostile environment in class by 
asking aggressive questions during 
presentations.

A former graduate student who 

entered the program in the fall of 2007 
asked to remain anonymous out of fear 
for professional repercussions. In this 
article, they will be referred to as Lauren.

SMTD premiers first in 

series of 10 compositions by 

Black composers

School commissioned pieces to make classical music more 

accessible and inclusive

CARLIN PENDELL 

Daily Staff Reporter

The University of Michigan 

School of Music, Theatre & Dance 
premiered 
“Tethered 
Voices”, 

the first of 10 compositions of the 
Michigan Orchestra Repertoire for 
Equity (MORE). The project aims to 
increase equity in classical music by 
commissioning 10 Black composers 
in the next 10 years.

Music, Theater & Dance pro-

fessor Kenneth Kiesler began the 
MORE project in 2020. He was 
motivated to commission “Teth-
ered Voices” after reading its name-
sake poem which was written by his 
colleague and friend Kalena Bovell. 
The poem is a reflection on the pro-
tests and racial anxiety following 
the death of George Floyd in May 
2020. Kiesler said he knew the first 
piece of the MORE project would 

involve Bovell’s work after reading 
“Tethered Voices.” Kiesler reached 
out to U-M alum James Lee III 
(’99, ’01, ’05) shortly after to write 
music to accompany the poem. 

In addition to her poetry, 

Bovell is involved in the music 
industry, serving as the assistant 
conductor of the Memphis Sym-
phony Orchestra. Kiesler and 
Bovell met over 10 years ago at 
the Conductors Retreat at Medo-
mak. 

The performance took place at 

Hill Auditorium and featured the 
University Symphony Orchestra. 

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily, Kiesler said 
Bovell’s poem and Lee’s epony-
mous composition are a power-
ful combination, living up to his 
expectations for the first piece of 
the project.

“Kalena sent me her poem, 

which she had just written, and 

when I read it, I immediately was 
moved by it,” Kiesler said. “I knew 
that this would be the first piece, 
so I contacted her right away and 
told her how I felt about the poem 
and asked if we could go ahead and 
have it set to be a piece for orches-
tra. She agreed later that day, so I 
asked James (to write the music) 
and we reached an agreement and 
the next day he started working on 
it … it’s an incredibly great piece and 
the two together — the music and 
the poem — really have the mov-
ing and inspiring impact that I had 
hoped the piece would have.”

Lee said equity in the music 

industry is extremely important, 
and there is always room for 
improvement. While writing the 
composition for the MORE proj-
ect, he tried to emphasize mean-
ingful words in Bovell’s poem 
and vocalize the emotions felt by 
many Black people today. 

“It’s this idea of being tired 

of the situation, tired of tears, 
tired of feeling hopeless, that 
kind of thing,” Lee said. “The 
very last line says ‘I’m tired of 
not being seen’, so it’s this kind 
of tiredness, of not being seen 
as equal — not being given equal 
opportunities.”

Bovell said she knew many 

people in the Black community 
shared her frustration and anger, 
especially following the death of 
George Floyd. She said Lee was 
able to convey her emotions in a 
meaningful piece of music. 

“It’s a really powerful piece,” 

Bovell said. “Musically, when 

you take the words away, there’s 
such a darkness and depth to 
it. I think (Lee) really was able 
to pull out the emotions that I 
was feeling when I wrote those 
words.”

As warmer weather comes to 

Ann Arbor, students are yearning 
for opportunities to spend time in 
the long-awaited spring sun. After 
being cooped up inside avoiding 
Michigan’s harsh winters, time 
outside is a precious thing for 
many Wolverines. 

Outside of many traditional 

D1 sports like football, hockey 
and basketball, some students at 
the University of Michigan have 
found hobbies and talents in other 
sports teams.

The Quidditch team has had 

much success since it was intro-
duced to Ann Arbor in 2010. This 
past fall, the team won awards 
at multiple tournaments, includ-
ing being named Michigan State 
University Starting Rush Cham-

pions, Penn State Nittany Invi-
tational Champions and Great 
Lakes Regionals runners-up. This 
semester, they have also been 
awarded Miami University Quaf-
fle House Cup Champions. The 
quidditch team will be heading 
to the national championship on 
April 23 and 24. 

Rackham student Mara Hill, 

an MSE student in the mechani-
cal 
engineering 
department, 

spoke to The Michigan Daily 
about their experience on the 
quidditch team. The rules of the 
game reflect those of the rules 
in the book, including keep-
ing a PVC pipe between your 
legs as you would a broomstick 
and using deflated volleyballs 
and dodgeballs as Quaffles and 
Bludgers. 

Hill said her favorite memory 

for the team was regionals dur-
ing their sophomore year. 

“At that time we had such a 

deep team, with talent and such, 
that we actually had two official 
teams at regionals … both teams 
did really really well …. it was 
just a full weekend of Quidditch 
and it was just so much fun,” Hill 
said. “It was the first time in my 
college career that I had a week-
end where I wasn’t home, and 
I didn’t think about school the 
entire time, and I was just sur-
rounded by that found-family 
sort of environment.” 

The 
Michigan 
quidditch 

team also strives for diversity, 
equity and inclusion on the field, 
according to Hill. Quidditch 
teams across the world follow 
gender inclusivity rules, which 
state that no more than four of 
the six players on the field (less 
the seeker) can be of the same 
gender.

CAMPUS LIFE


Arts
4 — Wednesday, April 13, 2022

“QUEER” IS A powerful word, and to 

be Queer is a powerful thing. For so many, 
art and Queerness are inextricably linked. 
The art we were exposed to growing up 
informed the way we came into our Queer-
ness, and now our Queerness informs the 
way we consume and make art. In almost 
everything I watch, read and listen to, I 
look for refractions of this part of myself 
in order to understand myself better and 
feel understood. Queerness means com-
munity; it means self-knowledge; it means 
anything that those who claim it want it 
to mean. I am unbelievably proud of and 
grateful for these writers and their will-
ingness to tell their stories for this B-Side, 
for their shaping of it into a fitting reflec-
tion on the infinitely diverse array of expe-
riences Queer people possess, for defining 
their Queerness on their own terms.

NEEDY LESNECKI (AMANDA SEY-

FRIED, “A MOUTHFUL OF AIR”) put 
it best: “Hell is a teenage girl.” Her own 
teenagehood is defined by fawning and 
fumbling over her lifelong best friend, 
Jennifer Check (Megan Fox, “Dakota”). 
Jennifer is cruel, controlling and, by 
the end of the film, a literal man-eater. 
Even more importantly, she represents 
the bisexual monster in the closet. Her 
dynamic with Needy is messy, and it pro-
vides a shockingly dimensional look at the 
raw and repressed sides of Queer teenage-
hood. 

To introduce Jennifer, narrator Needy 

word vomits a stream of compliment upon 
compliment, only to have her daydream 
interrupted by a classmate saying she’s 
“Totally lesbi-gay” for her attractive, mean 
and cooler friend. This is in the very first 
scene and sets the almost ironically Queer 
tone for the rest of the film. It almost feels 
embarrassing to admit this scene in “Jen-

nifer’s Body” is what introduced me to the 
possibility of a woman being Queer. My 
own digital presence aside, it indirectly 
introduced the word “lesbian” into my 
prepubescent dictionary. Queerness was a 
completely abstract concept at this point. 
As a sixth grader, I didn’t yet know any gay 
family, celebrities or friends. There wasn’t 
any blatant homophobia in my upbringing, 
especially from my immediate family and 
close friends, but rather a glaring absence 
of anything deviating from heterosexual-
ity. Young and unknowingly Queer, this 
was a complete absence of self. 

The plot of “Jennifer’s Body” is exqui-

sitely absurd — an unsuccessful indie 
band, Low Shoulder, attempts to sacrifice 
a virgin to Satan in exchange for unparal-
leled success. Unbeknownst to the band, 
their target virgin, Jennifer, is not quite 
a virgin, and she refuses to die in peace. 
Instead, she is turned into a succubus 
with an appetite for (mostly) boys. From 
this point on, she eats a variety of men to 
sustain herself, often choosing her prey 
based on their proximity to Needy.

After the Satanic ritual, she seeks out 

Needy. Blood-drenched and delirious, 
Jennifer saunters around Needy’s kitchen 
looking for a meal of meat. A terrified and 
naive Needy repeatedly asks what’s wrong 
and tries to dissuade Jennifer from eat-
ing her mom’s thawing chicken. Jennifer 
ignores her and vomits a black, tar-like 
liquid all over the kitchen. Before leav-
ing, Jennifer pulls Needy close to her and 
breathes down her neck, slowly moving 
to a gentle kiss and biting Needy’s throat. 
There is a brief flicker of temptation — to 
eat her friend and occasional sweetheart 
— before she asks if Needy is scared and 
throws her into the wall.

Horror aside, my own experiences with 

Queerness feel more similar to the intense 
friendship between Needy and Jennifer 
than other pieces of media representing 
relatively-realistic teenage love. Lucy and 
Amy sleep with the enemy, Megan and 
Graham run away together and Esti and 
Ronnit find each other again in adulthood. 
But those weren’t my experiences, and I 
will never get to have that type of story.

The Queer B-Side

A Queer girl’s guide to ‘Jennifer’s Body’

My gay girl playlist starter 
pack, from the new to the 

nostalgic

SOMETIMES I WISH I had 

gotten the gay college experience 
I thought I would have – “experi-
menting” with girls until I fig-
ured out that, hey, they weren’t 
experiments at all. Instead, I 
figured out I was bisexual while 
sitting in my childhood bedroom 
during the deep quarantine of 
the early pandemic. It would be 
great if I could paint my quaran-
tine as a beautiful, introspective 
time of self-reflection and chal-
lenging my internalized compul-
sory heterosexuality. And it was, 
to some extent — but mostly, I 
have to admit, I really just had a 
lot of time on my hands. Time to 
think and ponder and take “Am 
I Gay?” tests. (At some point I 
realized that if you take enough 
“Am I Gay” tests on the internet, 
it probably means you are gay.)

Most people can’t pinpoint the 

exact date they realized their 
own Queerness. As my own real-
ization came during the internet-
steeped pandemic summer of 
2020, I guess it makes sense that 
I can. Specifically, my Spotify 
history indicates a slew of sap-
phic love songs, all liked on July 
6, 2020. This includes gay girl 
classics like girl in red, Kehlani, 
Clairo, dodie and King Princess. 
Looking back, I can’t remem-
ber having one big revelatory 
moment where I decided that yes, 
I was Queer — but clearly, there 
was a day when I proclaimed (to 
my Spotify, at least) that I was. 

So why were these songs so 

important to my Queer awaken-
ing? Music is obviously crucial 
to a lot of personal moments and 
revelations, so it’s not like this 
was special. However, given the 
quarantine, they were the only 
way I could connect to a larger 
community. I couldn’t go to 
Necto or hang out at the Resi-
dential College. I couldn’t go 
to the Kerrytown Markets and 
buy nothing but still soak in the 
Queer energy of other 20-some-
things with tote bags. I was in 
my bedroom, the same bedroom 
in which I had considered myself 
“straight” for so many years. I 
felt like an outsider in my own 
life, unsure how to reconcile my 
Queerness with the purple walls 
of my childhood sanctuary. 

This was where I listened to 

Taylor Swift and One Direction 
— staples of my tweens, teenage-
dom and current playlists — but 
in that music, there was no space 
for Queerness. The heterosexu-
ality was overwhelming. When 
I played back “Love Story,” I 
remembered believing that — 
although I never dreamed of a 
big white wedding — the person 
I ended up with would unequivo-
cally be a man. I never thought 
to think otherwise. Other peo-
ple were allowed to be gay, and 
I wanted so badly to be one of 
them; but I thought because I 
liked men, there was no other 
option. There was no room for 
bisexuality until I got to college. 
In high school, even in my pro-

gressive college town, even if you 
were bi — you were gay: There 
was no space for any flexibility 
in identity. And flexibility was 
what I needed when labels felt so 
suffocating. 

But even though that long list 

of sequentially-liked Gay Girl™ 
songs felt affirming, it wasn’t 
what I had always listened to. It 
was a freeing and exhilarating 
experience to sing “girls” by girl 
in red with the windows down 
in my mom’s car, driving along-

side New Jersey farmlands. I felt 
seen by the longing Queer angst 
of “Ain’t Together” by King Prin-
cess. These all felt like me. But 
One Direction’s (albeit, strangely 
Queer coded) “They Don’t Know 
About Us” felt like me too. So 
did “Hey Stephen (Taylor’s Ver-
sion).” I wanted to feel unified, 
not like there were disparate 
parts of me separated into dispa-
rate Spotify playlists. 

But then there were two 

things: 
former 
1Der 
Harry 

Styles’s Fine Line and Taylor 
Swift’s re-records. First, Styles 
was morphing seamlessly from 
boybander to rainbow-adorned 
popstar. After One Direction 
disbanded in 2015 and with 
the release of his debut self-
titled solo album in 2017, Styles 
began coming into his own as 
a star. With 2019’s Fine Line, 
he embraced a campy, colorful 
musical and visual aesthetic. 
His songs used overwhelmingly 
gender-neutral 
pronouns. 
He 

released “Lights Up” on National 
Coming Out Day, complete with a 
music video featuring a shirtless 
Styles being touched by people of 
all genders. “Treat People With 
Kindness” is an explosion of joy 
and love that feels unequivocally 
Queer. Styles himself refuses to 
label his own sexuality, in a free-
ing expression of flexible sexual-
ity that felt freeing for me — he 
could feel comfortable in his own 
skin without putting a label on 
that feeling for anyone else.

Taylor Swift, too, was reclaim-

ing her old self and transforming 
it into something both entirely 
new and sweetly nostalgic. She 

released sister albums folklore 
and evermore several months 
apart in 2020, leaning strongly 
into the indie/folk genre and 
steering away from her previous 
pure-pop persona. On folklore, 
Swift sings “betty” near the end 
of the album, a song about a girl 
that uses feminine pronouns — 
one that still makes me shed a 
little gay tear if I’m in the right 
mood. After her indie-girl pivot, 
she began re-recording her old 
albums in order to take back con-
trol of her masters from Scooter 
Braun. The re-records include 
tracks “From the Vault,” which 
are songs that didn’t make their 
original 
albums, 
and 
recre-

ate album covers in a way that 
is tactfully reminiscent of the 
original covers without being 
direct copies. Each song includes 
a (somewhat cheeky, very cute) 
“(Taylor’s Version)” addendum 
after every track title on her re-
recorded albums. Swift stays 
faithful to the soundtrack of my 
youth while still feeling true to 
who she is now, years later. 

Both Styles and Swift claim 

their past proudly; Styles con-
sistently sings “What Makes 
You Beautiful” on tour and Swift 
faithfully re-records every song 
she put out when she was 18. 
There was room in both of these 
childhood playlist staples to 
grow into someone with a more 
flexible and informed identity, 
and I could grow with them. If 
Harry Styles still sings his big 
One Direction hit on stage with a 
pride flag around his shoulders, 
why shouldn’t I enjoy a little 
“Midnight Memories”? If Taylor 
Swift didn’t think it was embar-
rassing 
to 
re-record 
“White 

Horse,” why shouldn’t I listen 
to it to get a little weepy? There 
was room for me, all of me, on my 
playlist of music, both past and 
present.

‘Bend It Like Beckham’ isn’t a queer story, but it’s part of mine

Nothing is really ‘Straight Up’

OKAY, TIME FOR a confession.
Long before I began to unpack my 

internalized misogyny and unchecked 
ego, I was just another girl who clung 
to wearing weird clothes and an inter-
est in sports in the name of being 
“not like other girls.” Since then, I’ve 
embraced how beautiful and complex 
being a woman is, and how I can be 
perfectly myself and similar to a lot 
of other women — a truly lovely thing. 
But before I could come to terms with 
such a concept, I needed to uncover 
the missing piece of myself that was 
ardently telling me I was different and 
could never fit in with the girls around 
me. This, I would realize, was my 

unrecognized Queerness.

When people ask me now about being 

bisexual and whether it was something 
I always knew about myself, I chuckle 
because the answer is no, but I totally 
should have. My journey to recogni-
tion required a series of key moments, 
spurned on by passing touches, lin-
gering feelings in my stomach and 
encountering a pivotal piece of media 
at precisely the right time. For me, this 
was “Bend It Like Beckham.”

It’s no secret that the film is a Queer 

allegory, though not a Queer story. It 
explicitly depicts Jessminder (Par-
minder Nagra, “The Blacklist”), or Jess 
— a tomboy who is forbidden from play-
ing soccer (or football) because it isn’t 
proper for a girl, according to her par-
ents — and implicitly depicts her secret 
desire to be herself much in the same 

way many experience Queerness. All 
the while, she is encouraged to follow 
her passion without inhibition by her 
narrative foil, teammate and other half 
of an incredibly homoerotic friendship, 
Jules (Keira Knightley, “Anna Kar-
enina”). Ultimately, it was the undeni-
able chemistry between Jess and Jules, 
from their shared passion for soccer 
to their easy banter and mutual dis-
dain for boys, that made me realize 
maybe my aching desire for a relation-
ship like theirs wasn’t based in friend-
ship — I already had plenty of valued, 
close friendships with women — but 
was instead fueled by something more 
romantic. 

There is plenty of analysis out there 

that gets into the nitty gritty of just how 
sapphic Jules and Jess’s relationship 
really was, including the abundance of 

lingering gazes and their Queer-coded 
aesthetics (their hatred for bras isn’t 
exactly subtle). From start to finish, it’s 
glaringly obvious that the film is laced 
with Queer-coded elements. There is 
the character of Tony (Ameet Chana, 
“Unhallowed Ground”) who explicitly 
comes out as gay, as well as direct ref-
erences to Queerness, like when Jules 
says, “Being a lesbian isn’t that big of a 
deal.” In a moment of unchecked leg-
end behavior, Knightley even remarked 
during an interview that Jules and Jess 
should have ended up together and that 
she wants a lesbian sequel.

So you can imagine young me’s dis-

appointment when the film decides to 
run with a lukewarm romance between 
Jess and her soccer coach, Joe (Jona-
than Rhys Meyers, “The Tudors”) 
instead. (To this day … ew.) To the 

film’s credit, it does put genuine effort 
into building a developed relationship 
in which both characters are vulner-
able with each other; Joe opens up 
about his relationship with his father, 
and Jess describes her relationship 
with her parents and her insecurities. 
Yet even during my first watch, I got 
the sense that their relationship was 
one of mutual emotional support, cer-
tainly, but not one with any romantic 
chemistry. I felt betrayed by the forced 
run to the airport scene at the end, 
because Jess had never shown any seri-
ous interest in boys prior, and even if 
the film didn’t depict Jess and Jules in 
a romantic relationship, why would a 
relationship with a man be the narra-
tive’s cathartic moment?

“WHAT IF I’M not gay?” 
This may not be the first line of James 

Sweeney’s feature film debut “Straight Up,” 
but it may as well be. Todd (Sweeney, debut) 
sits in a diner across from his friends, model 
Meg (Dana Drori, “Freaky”) and compe-
tent gay Ryder (James Scully, “You”), trying 
to convince them that he’s straight. In his 
current rationalization, Todd is only gay 
because everyone else deems him as such — 
he embodies the idea of “gay,” therefore he 
is. Desperate to not be alone, he believes that 
giving heterosexuality a shot will magically 
find him a partner, and it miraculously does 
in the form of aspiring actress Rory (Katie 
Findlay, “Man Seeking Woman”).

Let’s be clear — the relationship between 

Todd and Rory is about as cisgender-het-
erosexual (cishet) as I am, which is to say: 
not. On account of Todd’s intense hatred of 
bodily fluids and Rory’s past sexual trauma, 
sex plays no part in their connection; they 
instead have hours-long conversations 
about grammar and idioms, or they bond 
over dinner and a weekly documentary. If 
it weren’t for their deep emotional interde-
pendency, you could almost mistake them 
as best friends who kiss sometimes. From 
the outside, it seems a bit Queer, but is there 
anything wrong with that?

Todd and Rory remind me of myself and 

my previous partners. In fact, it was with 
my most recent partner that I first watched 
the movie. Snuggled up together in my bed 
with the laptop resting above my waist, 
we viewed the film as a cishet couple. We 
laughed at Sweeney’s clever wordplay and 
slick jokes, we held our breath during the 
climactic break-up and we smiled sweetly 

at the neat and joyful resolution. In essence, 
we missed the entire point of the film. 

Watching it now, one year of being single 

and a tangled mess of gender and sexual-
ity, it’s impossible not to recognize that 

my relationship faced the same dilemmas. 
Long before I came out, the sexual pillar of 
our relationship was crumbling; whether it 
was the constant long-distance or our men-
tal states is anybody’s guess. The time we 
spent together was experiential: We’d bake 
treats, cook meals, watch movies, finish one 
another’s sentences. I knew her idiosyncra-

sies and she knew mine — you could almost 
mistake us for best friends who kissed 
sometimes.

A conversation with my therapist 

about my gender identity

Editor’s Note: The author of this contribu-

tion has requested anonymity for safety. In 
accordance with our ethics policy (which can 
be found in full in our bylaws), the Editor-in-
identity.w


today, I wonder if you maybe want to talk 
about your gender identity a little bit?)

YEAH, ACTUALLY I do. I didn’t even 

realize it, but I actually have been think-
ing about this a lot lately. So, yeah, let’s talk 
about it. 

Here’s where I’m at with the whole gen-

der thing: One of the reasons I first wanted 
to go to therapy was because of some new 
gender dysphoria I started feeling a year 
or so ago. And after a lot of struggling and 
wrestling with the concept and the feelings, 
I feel like this semester I was finally more 
confident in where I landed. Which is why 
we haven’t talked about it yet. But lately, I 
have been questioning again.

Basically, I thought I was nonbinary, like 

yeah for sure I don’t feel super like a woman 
but I also don’t have a penis, so like, what do 
I do with that? And this semester I finally 
just bit the bullet and started introducing 
myself with they/she pronouns. And that felt 

fine, I suppose.

But the problem is there are not a ton of 

places halfway through a school year where 
it makes sense to introduce yourself with 
your pronouns. And just the whole concept 

of sharing and defining pronouns, in gen-
eral, makes me squeamish. And I was not 
about to announce my “new” identity to the 
world. Because I still was not sure that those 
were good words to use for me. So yeah, 
everyone was basically still using she/her 
pronouns for me because, unfortunately (?), 
that is the most obvious assumption. 

(Well, I actually think you look pretty 

androgynous in my opinion.) 

Thank you! Thank you! And it always 

feels like such a compliment when people 
don’t assume my gender! Which I suppose is 
a confirmation of these nonbinary feelings.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
Michigan in Color
6 — Wednesday, April 13, 2022

A recent article published in The Michi-

gan Review left many Michigan students 
appalled yet unsurprised. After digesting 
the manipulative and hateful content of the 
piece, we felt that it was necessary to address 
the author’s poor interpretation of Ameri-
can racial dynamics and recycled conserva-
tive talking points in order to debunk some 
fundamental issues that appear in common 
discourse. We need to talk about “reverse 
racism.” 

Reverse racism is first and foremost 

a myth. The concept also referred to as 
reverse discrimination, is the backward 
notion that color-conscious programs such 
as affirmative action that seek to address 
racial inequality are a form of anti-white 
racism. Not only is this concept completely 
ludicrous, it is also an immensely harmful 
ideology that actively sets back racial prog-
ress.

The current battleground of this discus-

sion is the Trotter Multicultural Center 
here on Central Campus. In an attempt to 
drum up controversy, the author of the piece 
grossly mischaracterizes the purpose and 
history of the building in order to perpetu-
ate the harmful narrative that marginalized 

students of Color are actively engaging in 
some sort of modern ‘reverse segregation’.

For context, a Black graduate student sub-

mitted a letter to the University of Michigan 
Administration expressing his frustration at 

“white student organizations kicking Black 
and brown students out of spaces within 
Trotter because their white organizations 
reserved the space.” Instead of understand-
ing the historical and societal context of 
these events and coming away from the situ-

ation with reflection or understanding, the 
author proceeded to react to the letter with 
an air of indignation and disgust. 

“It has become almost a cliche to say it 

at this point, but if a white advisor to CSG 

wrote a letter to the administration articu-
lating his discomfort that there are too many 
black students in a campus space, he would 
be deemed unfit for office,” the article states.

This is a demonstrably disingenuous per-

spective of the events taking place in Trotter 

and is only a small example of the “reverse 
racist” rhetoric that permeates the article. 

The author’s apparent “gotcha” moment 

highlighted in this quote only serves to show 
how hopelessly delusional his perspectives 
on racism and race relations actually are. 
His purposeful ignorance of the historical 
context of segregation and domination of 
Black Americans at the hands of the white 
race is as disgusting as it is shallow. 

To no one’s surprise, the author has not 

and will continue to not have any repercus-
sions for his racist assertions against the 
students who find a safe haven in Trotter. 
We do not mean to imply that the University 
should necessarily take action against this 
student for practicing his freedom of speech. 
However, we do mean to say that neither he 
nor other white students at this university 
have to deal with the emotional anguish that 
comes from the public release of such tone-
deaf, insensitive and historically inaccurate 
information. 

How did we get here? How does the dom-

inant racial group get to play the victim? 

For some, the concept of racism is very 

easy to grasp. Throughout our lives, we are 
taught that discrimination against another 
on the basis of their race is a practice that 
should be denounced and outright abolished. 
We hear about and learn of the historical 
figures who fought against racist oppression 
and paved the way for our modern society. 

We hear of their virtue and undying loyalty 
to social justice and humanity and celebrate 
their memory. Many historical figures, par-
ticularly of the Civil Rights Movement, are 
rightfully lauded as heroes.

We all know of the legacies of Dr. Mar-

tin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, Malcolm 
X, Charles Houston, Harry T and Harriette 
Moore, among many others. Yet, for some 
reason, the author felt the need to twist the 
words of Dr. King in order to portray him-
self, and white students by extension, as the 
victims of systemic racism. This is gross. We 
shouldn’t need to explain why this is prob-
lematic, but we genuinely don’t think the 
author understands. So let’s engage in basic 
modern social theory. 

Racism and discrimination are not the 

two-way streets that the author implies. The 
historical domination, oppression, enslave-
ment, rape and perverted bastardization of 
Black culture by the white race is the foun-
dation of this country. The vestiges of that 
cultural dynamic permeate throughout 
every modern institution. Black students 
cannot segregate white students. This is 
simple. To insinuate that the author and 
other white students can be the victims of 
targeted racism is tantamount to claiming 
Black students have any sort of profound 
institutional authority. 

Not enough white people in Trotter Multicultural Center, white student claims

The beauty of wilted flowers

It was a ceremonial and cine-

matic day in Santiago Papasquiaro, 
Durango. The streets were flooded 
with families observing the cere-
monies taking place throughout the 
city. At every angle of our periph-
eral, there were bandas playing 
corridos, food trucks selling elotes 
and raspados and a desfile full of 
mariachi bands accompanied with 
young women dressed in folklórico 
attire. We were making our way to 
the feria, which for many was the 
main attraction of the festivities. 
Though the cloudy weather may 
have discouraged many from being 
outside, there was no denying that 
the people of Santiago Papasquiaro 
were not going to miss the first day 
of their esteemed and most antici-
pated fair. 

Since I was in the sixth grade, 

my family and I traveled to my par-
ents’ hometown in Mexico every 
year. The month of July attracted 
not only a lot of domestic visitors, 
but a lot of other Mexican-Amer-
ican families that had ties to the 
state of Durango. I felt immensely 
joyous to be standing on the soil 
where generations of my family 
had grown up.

Except in 2016, I wasn’t real-

ly there. I was in the middle of 
nowhere Montana.

The date was July 16. The fright-

ening noise of my phone’s alarm 
jolted me awake at 4:30 in the 
morning. Reality quickly sank in, 
and I was upset that I was not a 
part of the vibrant crowd march-
ing down the streets of Santiago 
Papasquiaro. Rather than spend-
ing the summer in Mexico visiting 
my abuelitas and primos, my dad 
insisted that my brother Oscar and 
I spend a couple of months with 
him in Montana to work at his con-
struction site—the very opposite 
of Durango. The wind blew loudly 

through the many valleys and 
mountaintops of America’s ninth 
least populated state. Within those 
blue, green and gray valleys was 
scattered, sparse and rundown 
infrastructure. The very limited 
civilization seemed so insignifi-
cant when contrasted to the vast-
ness of the state’s nature. People 
displayed classic American cordi-
ality, of course, but rarely the hos-
pitality and colors I had witnessed 
in Mexico just a year prior. 

At 15 years old, the thought of 

making my own money seemed 
promising and offered some finan-
cial freedom my peers were not 
afforded. After doing my own 
research on the up and coming 
state, I learned that many other 
construction workers ventured to 
the Great Plains state of Montana 
and made really good money. Hell, 
I was excited! Little did I know 
what I was getting myself into.

After two months of working 

with my dad, I somehow failed to 
get used to the monotonous rou-
tine he went through every morn-
ing. The pesky alarm, pungent 
smell of the drywall and joint com-
pound boxes scattered throughout 
our temporary apartment compet-
ed with my overwhelming drowsi-
ness from my lack of sleep. We had 
returned home from the construc-
tion site at 1:30 a.m., a few hours 
prior, so it was extremely difficult 
for me to find some sort of motiva-
tion to keep my eyes open. 

On the other hand, my dad had 

no problem with getting less than 
three hours of sleep. He somehow 
managed to wake up in a radiant 
mood every morning. Every other 
day, he would wake up earlier than 
the rest of the crew and buy us all 
donuts from the nearest 7-Eleven. 
It annoyed me so much in my tired 
grumpiness. How the hell did he 
do it? He urged Oscar and me to 
hurry because he did not want us 
to be late on our last day of work.

My dad has worked in construc-

tion for more than 30 years. In 
those three decades, he has mas-
tered the craft of drywall finish-
ing. Construction workers who 
specialize in this are referred to as 
tapers. Though the task of a taper 
is considered by many other con-
struction workers to be one of the 
least physically demanding, the 
monotonous task of smearing joint 
compound across hundreds of dif-
ferent units still felt extremely 
strenuous. I had no idea how my 
dad, at the age of 54, remained 
poised through these conditions. 
Although my dad is nearing the age 
in which he becomes eligible for 
the plethora of benefits all elderly 
Americans are entitled to, my dad’s 
citizenship status deems him ineli-
gible of receiving these perks.

Both of my parents are law-

fully permanent residents. My 
dad first came to the United States 
in 1988. One of my uncles, who 
had migrated to the states before 
my dad, was in Chicago at the 
time and informed my dad of the 
rapidly expanding employment 
opportunities. Eventually, my dad 
returned to Mexico and got mar-
ried to my mom. My parents both 
agreed that if they wanted to start 
a family, moving to the United 
States was the right thing to do 
because of the seemingly limitless 
upward mobility and the ultimate 
allure of the American Dream. In 
1997, both of my parents crossed 
the Mexican-American border and 
headed back to Chicago.

One year later, my parents 

moved from Chicago to Las Vegas 
because my dad was aware of the 
surplus of jobs available for con-
struction workers there. But when 
the boom subsided in Las Vegas, 
my dad was forced to leave his 
workers union. Because of this, 
for a very long period of my life 
growing up, my dad struggled 
with keeping a stable job. Since I 
was in elementary school, my dad 
has traveled to other states expe-

riencing similar booms to that of 
Las Vegas in order to find work. I 
can still remember the first time 
he went away when I first started 
the first grade. We were all weep-
ing because, for the first time, my 
dad was going to be so far from us 

and we wouldn’t see him until the 
next summer.

Neither of my parents were 

aware of the struggles they would 
blatantly face in trying to start 
a new family in a new country. 
Because of their citizenship status 
and lack of English proficiency, 
my parents have been hindered 
from the opportunity to live the 
life akin to that of the model white 
American family. Even to this day, 
my parents struggle with under-
standing mainstream American 
lingo and etiquettes and thus have 
rarely formed relationships with 
anyone else that didn’t experience 
the same immigration experience 
as them.

Nonetheless, my dad has put our 

entire family on his back. Growing 
up, my mother had to watch over 
me and my four siblings so it was 
very difficult for her to go out of 
her way to contribute to my fam-
ily’s income. Because of this, my 
family relied solely on my dad to 

put food on the table. Although 
my dad would continuously get 
his checks postponed, work in the 
coldest and most rural states in 
the nation and work an arduous 
amount of time every day, he never 
overtly displayed his exhaustion 
or dismissed us as a result. He was 
truly inspirational. My time work-
ing with him made me think of all 
the sacrifices he has made for the 
literal survival of my family.

The location of our worksite 

was in Bozeman, but the apart-
ment the rest of my dad’s work 
crew and I were staying at was in 
Belgrade. It takes 30 minutes to get 
from one city to the other and we 
were expected to arrive by 5 a.m. 
As brain fogged as I was, I swiftly 

slipped on my murky brown Wol-
verine work boots, stained white 
Dickies, 
ripped 
white 
Hanes 

T-shirt and headed straight to my 
dad’s white 2001 Chevrolet Astro 
van to wait for the rest of the crew. 

The skies remained gloomy from 

the night storm’s heavy showers. 
Though it was the middle of the 
summer, it felt as if I was stuck 
in a time loop in Montana and 
every day was replicative of that 
one overcast morning. My dad, 
dressed in his all-white work uni-
form, briskly maneuvered his way 
to the van. His silhouette, despite 
the backdrop of somber surround-
ings and nasty weather, main-
tained rhythmic footsteps trotting 
toward the van. Though my dad 
was noticeably older than the rest 
of the crew, there was something 
about his upbeat demeanor that 
made everyone else come off as 
downhearted.

Oversized 
jackets, 
jumbled 

chargers, weird wall decor and 
half melted candles clutter my 
roommates’ and I’s already small 
apartment. A high-rise build-
ing stands tall outside our large 
living room window, blocking 
off any daylight from flooding 
the apartment. Sitting among 
the clutter and the gloom is an 
orange-tinted vase. Growing out 
of the vase are soft, bright pet-
als flowing from the stems of a 
set of pink carnations. The floral 
aroma fills the tiny living room it 
sits in, but in a subtle way. It is not 
strong enough to smell when you 
walk in, but noticeable as soon 
as you sit down on the old, dark 
couch right across from it. When 
you don’t directly look at them, 
the flowers easily blend into the 
clutter, but once you do, they 
catch your eye. They brighten the 
entire dark apartment, bringing 
in that touch of brightness the liv-
ing room desperately needs every 
morning and afternoon. They add 
a layer of freshness that our dry, 
closed-off apartment can’t bring 

in since the windows are sealed 
shut. The freshness hits our faces 
when we come back from class 
later in the day, comforting us.

Growing up, I never cared for 

flowers. If anything, I disliked 
them. I disliked how expensive 
bouquets from the florists were. I 
disliked the bees that came with 
them. I disliked how much effort 
people put into growing them, 
and I disliked how mad they’d 
get when my ball rolled into their 
flower patch. I disliked their 
names, since I could never pro-
nounce them. I disliked how much 
work maintaining them was. But 
the biggest of all, I disliked how 
they’d always die so soon. My 
mother would always say they 
were a waste of money because 
of how quickly they would fall. 
When my family would buy her 
flowers, she’d get mad, telling us 
not to waste money. She’d only let 
us buy flowers to use when doing 
poojas as offerings to God. But for 
the personal decoration aspect, 
she would refuse to buy them. 
Instead, she brought up the idea 
of artificial flowers. She’d say 
they were just as pretty, and they 
last forever. So now our home is 
filled with tall glass vases hold-

ing fake roses and fake tulips and 
fake hydrangeas and fake peo-
nies, every fake flower the local 
craft stores had on sale.

As I got older, I started dis-

agreeing more with my mother, 
especially with her stance on 
flowers. I always kept my opinion 
to myself because I understood 
costs add up. The only times I 
got to pick out real flowers were 
for our poojas. We would rush to 
Nino’s on our way to the Bharati-
ya Temple, and I would follow 
quickly behind my mother into 
the store, since we were already 
late to the scheduled pooja. We’d 
speed to the flower section. They 
always had a variety of beauti-
ful flowers, every color that you 
could think of. They’d sometimes 
have roses, jasmine, sunflowers, 
lilies and mums, but they always 
had carnations, usually the pink 
ones. Carnations were our staple 
— the flower we would get almost 
every pooja. They were always 
the cheapest ones at the store and 
the most readily available. My 
brother and I would sit there in 
the car, cutting them off of their 
stems in preparation for pooja. If 
we did the pooja at home instead 
of the temple, we would sit at the 

dining table taking turns cutting 
them. I’d do the first half, and he’d 
do the second. Once pooja began, 
we would pick each petal off and 
offer it to god. I would sneak one 
of the flowers in my pocket or put 
it under my leg until after pooja. 
After coming home or leaving our 
pooja room, I’d keep it in my room 
until it almost completely disin-
tegrated, because I didn’t know 
how to properly preserve them 
(and still don’t), or until it got lost.

Eventually, my father took up 

gardening 
during 
quarantine. 

He’d buy packets and packets 
of seeds and plant them under a 
grow light, then transfer them 
outside once it got warm. He’d 
take me to Bordine’s, the nearest 
flower and plant shop, and let me 
help pick out the flower plants I 
liked. He never bought the ones 
I picked, but he let me give my 
input on the colors of the flowers 
he liked. We’d get hydrangeas, 
hibiscus, zinnias and three dif-
ferent colors of roses. No carna-
tions. 

Moving out of the house, I was 

given real flowers for the first 
time instead of the fake ones my 
mother loved, for my apartment. 
I came home all excited to put 

them in our vase. An instant smile 
grew wide on my face from how 
pretty the flowers were. Coin-
cidently, they were pink carna-
tions, my favorite. They reminded 
me of when I was younger and 
would sneak a few flowers from 
the bunch to keep in my room. 
The flowers did everything arti-
ficial ones could never do. They 
brought in a calming aroma into 
the room, a feeling of fresh life, a 
splash of subtle color, brightening 
the room in every way fake ones 
couldn’t. But within two weeks or 
so, they died. 

Day by day, another flower 

would droop over to the side. A 
petal would fall, laying next to 
the vase on the black table. The 
feeling of freshness left the room 
along with any life left in those 
pretty flowers. They wilted and 
were done for. But I’d leave them 
in the vase, because I can never 
get myself to throw them out. To 
throw out something so beauti-
ful and selfless felt wrong. The 
tiniest amount of life left in them 
still brightened the room, at least 
in my eyes. And thinking about 
it, there was something equally 
beautiful in the pile of fallen pet-
als and drooping stems. How 

they still shine even with a pale 
hue that takes over each petal. 
How the pretty flower smell 
would remain even though it was 
so subtle. How they still caught 
everyone’s eyes once they saw the 
vase, but in a are they saving dead 
flowers way. There was some-
thing beautiful in the way they’d 
fall after holding on for so long 
once they were cut from their 
plant, how they selflessly held on 
for so long just to make our lives 
more beautiful. How each flower 
would fall after giving every bit 
of life it had left, until it couldn’t 
hold on or give any more any lon-
ger.

The wilted flowers added some 

things to my life that the fresh 
ones couldn’t. It dropped petals 
for me to keep as a pretty col-
lection. It made my roommates 
laugh a little every time they’d see 
it, filling our room with laughter 
which, in turn, brightened up the 
room. It was an incentive to go 
buy more flowers. And it was a 
reminder to appreciate the things 
in our life in the moment because 
eventually, they will wilt. And it 
was a message that the end itself 
is just as beautiful as the flowers 
first blooming still on the plant.

I’ve always loved birthdays, whether they 

were mine or somebody else’s. The thought 
of gathering to celebrate the life of somebody 
you love has always been an exciting part 
of every year. But when my own birthday 
creeps its way around the calendar, I always 
find myself reflecting on my life experiences. 
When I realized that on March 22, 2022, I 
would be turning 20 years old, I was almost 
shocked. Of course, I knew that it would hap-
pen eventually — one more year around the 
sun calls for turning one year older — but 
turning 20 always seemed so distant. This 
year, my birthday didn’t feel as exciting as 
it used to before — instead, it felt daunting, 
and I dreaded leaving behind the shelter that 
came with being a teenager.

Turning 20 made me anxious. To some, 

leaving the “teen years” feels like emerg-
ing into adulthood with open arms. For me, 
dropping the “-teen” at the end of my age felt 
like the clock had sped up too fast for me to 
catch up to. I try to reflect on my teen years 
with a certain fondness; not to say that they 
were all painless, but they allowed me to 
harbor a great deal of wisdom and growth 
at such young ages. I remember turning 15 
and hardly being able to wait for my 16th 
birthday, the birthday that society harps on 
as being an emergence into your true teenage 
years. I remember feeling nervous, but eager-
ly awaiting the expectations of newfound 
independence, like driving (even though I 
didn’t do much of it), staying out later and 
being taken more seriously by the adults in 
my life.

While my younger self had thought that 

this would be the peak of my young adult-
hood, I had merely entered a year filled with 
the insecurity and stress that came with 
being an emerging junior in high school. 
At the time, I was entangled in the all-con-
suming feeling of not being good enough — 
whether that be over my top choice college 
(which, spoiler alert, I now attend), or the 
friend group I was floating through, or the 
courses I was taking. I felt as though I was 
in constant competition with a standard 
that I could never reach: perfection. Every-
body seemed to worry about being “popu-
lar” or getting the best grades or test scores. 
As a generally anxious person, I always felt 
as though these superficial standards were 
impossible to meet. Nobody is liked by every-
one, and not everybody can receive straight 
As or a 1600 on their SAT. And certainly, 
people can’t always acquire all three of those 
traits. Even while being well-aware of this, 
I had tried my hardest to climb to the top of 
every ladder. Although I wasn’t a perfection-
ist, I was constantly surrounded by the stress 
of being perfect and doing more than what 
was expected in order to soar far beyond the 
walls of my small high school. Little did I 
know, feeling like I am “not enough” is a bat-
tle that even my 20-year-old self struggles to 
overcome long after graduating high school. 

I want to say that since coming to college, 

my imposter syndrome has gotten both bet-
ter and worse. Although I am more mature 
and secure in myself, I still battle with the 
ever-present fear of not being where I “need 
to be.” Coming from a high school that is 
composed of an overwhelmingly Arab stu-
dent body, where most students are not met 
with the opportunity of moving away for col-
lege or even attending a university like the 
University of Michigan, I face a new struggle 

of assimilating into a Predominantly White 
Institution (PWI) as an underrepresented 

student of Color. Dealing with these compli-
cated, ever-present experiences has shown 
me that the journey of growing up is not a 
straight road. The complex twists and turns 
of turning older are bittersweet, and they 
make learning and reflecting on my identity 
that much more important.

Quickly, I learned that being 16 was no 

match for turning 18. I would go on to gradu-
ate high school at the top of my class, attend 
college at my dream school, move onto cam-
pus and leave the town I had worked so des-
perately to escape. Because I came from a 
school as small as my own — with a graduat-
ing class of 88 people, which I attended from 
kindergarten throughout my senior year — I 
was eager to leave the familiar walls and go 

on to much more. Even though I didn’t get 
straight As in high school, or anywhere near 

a 1600 SAT score, it taught me that my goals 
are obtainable if I am passionate or dedicated 
enough to a cause. I learned that perfection 
isn’t always expected and that “perfection” is 
taught as a fear response to “not being good 
enough,” a struggle that I have since then 
learned that most people are battling. Even 
though my 18th birthday was two years ago, 
that year defined what I set out to be for the 
rest of my life: entirely my own. Since then, 
I consider the last two years to be my most 
pivotal years of growth. I would hold the 
world in the palm of my hands and stare at 
it through my rose-colored lenses, marching 
through the streets of Ann Arbor as if noth-
ing in the world could get in the way of my 
goals, passions or self-proclaimed expecta-

tions. Although I continually deal with anxi-
ety around self-assurance, becoming 18 was 
remarkably important to shifting how I view 
myself and developing my identity.

Over this last year of being 19, the founda-

tion of confidence and security I had begun 
to build was met with the weight of trying 
to proudly showcase my Lebanese, Muslim 
identity at a PWI. This created a different 
level of emotional turmoil that I had never 
experienced before in my sheltered, small 
town of predominantly Arabs and Mus-
lims. I also held the fears of not being able 
to achieve my academic and personal goals, 
not only because of my own barriers but 
because of barriers that were placed upon me 
by systems and people who may never even 
know me. While I had some experience with 
being “othered” prior to this, I channeled my 
anxiety into becoming more introspective; 
I allowed my hardships to drive me to be 
passionate and loud about causes that were 
important to displaying my identity. 

At 19, I realized that every year of life 

comes with its own set of ups and downs, 
but instead of trying to escape them, I have 
learned to embrace them for what they give 
me in return. Experience. Maturity. Grati-
tude. Empathy. When I look back at my 
16-year-old self — the anxious teenager who 
worried so much about what her life would 
become, if her friends truly liked her, what 
college she would go to — I see a girl who 
stressed too much, who worked to please 
the people in her life, who gave herself up to 
help others, who worked herself more than 
her capacity. I think of myself, who still does 
these things, and feel so much love for the 
girl who tries so hard to just be.

Let’s get one thing straight: Serena Wil-

liams is the greatest tennis player of all 
time. This is a hill I’ll stand tall on any day. 
She broke barriers in her field, winning 23 
Grand Slam titles and four Olympic gold 
medals. Not to mention, she won the Aus-
tralian Opeejlesr social lives. Similarly, my 
father pushed my brothers and me to be 
academically successful, to keep in touch 
with our culture and to always have fun. 
He understood the importance of keeping 
the balance in life, navigating work and 
fun. In addition, he encouraged us to find 
fun within our work. When we were in 
elementary school, our father encouraged 
us to play outside and hang out with our 
friends every day. He also made sure we 
spent time during the day practicing and 
memorizing our multiplication tables. My 
father turned these multiplication tables 
into games to play in the car. A memory my 
father shares of him and my older brother 
is that every time they would drive some-
where together, my father would ask a ran-
dom multiplication question like “what’s 
six times seven?” and see how quick my 
brother could answer, turning our aca-
demic work into a game we could have fun 
with. 

Richard Williams did the same for his 

children. The film shows that he made 
sure his children practiced tennis every 
day and got their homework done every 
night for school. During matches, he 
reminded his daughters that the only thing 
they were there to do was to have fun. Out-
side of tennis and school, he encouraged 
them to watch movies, sing together and, 
at one point in the film, he even took them 
on vacation to Disneyworld. He allowed 
his children to be children and have a fun 

childhood while also pushing them to be 
academically and athletically the best. 

Richard Williams made it clear in the 

film that all he wanted was for his children 
to live a better life than he lived. He told 
his daughters that he was never respect-
ed growing up, but that they would be 
respected. My father has the same aspira-
tions for his children, in that he wishes for 
us to live a better life than he did. My father 
moved to the United States from India, 
leaving behind his family, his friends and 
the life he grew up knowing. He migrated 
to a country in which he knew no one and 
had to overwork a job he would get under-
paid for, all while learning to speak a brand 
new language. He made countless sacrific-
es just to ensure his children would have 
an easier time navigating the world. 

In the film, Richard brought Venus and 

Serena home from a rainy night practice 
one night. They were welcomed by police 
cars outside their house and officers inside. 
The officers explained that their neighbor 
had filed a complaint that the family was 
being too rough on their daughters. Dur-
ing the scene, one official asked Richard, 
“Isn’t it too late for practice, don’t the 
kids have school work?” Brandy, Rich-
ard’s wife, jumped in and said, “They do 
their homework,” and explained how her 
daughters are first in their class. Richard 
explained to the officers that they’re hard 
on their kids because they “have to be to 
keep them off these streets,” referring to 
their poverty-stricken and crime-ridden 
neighborhood in their hometown, Comp-
ton. I’m privileged enough to say that I’ve 
never had to interact with the jarring and 
audacious police force in the same way 
that the Williams family had to as depicted 
in this film. However, the notion of a third 
party over-stepping into their family’s per-
sonal lives and decision-making felt a bit 
familiar, although in a different context.

There was an incident where a teacher 

at my middle school called my parents one 
night. This particular teacher was leading 
an information session on standardized 
tests. 

I nervously walked into the room where 

the information session was being held. I 
caught the glances of all the other older 
students in the room and immediately felt 
my body shrivel up. There was a teacher 
at the front of the classroom with a stack 
of papers on a desk, and a line of students 
in front of her. I quietly stood in line and 
twiddled my thumbs, avoiding eye contact 
with the other students before I eventually 
made it to the teacher and her desk.

“Hi there, what’s your name?”
“Smarani.”
The teacher immediately looked puz-

zled. I could feel the students behind me 
in line becoming impatient as the teacher 
squinted her eyes, shuffling through her 
papers before eventually pulling them 
closer to her. I tried to look over to see 
what the papers were and caught a glimpse 
of what looked like a roster of some sort, 
showing a list of a bunch of students’ first 
and last names.

“The last name is Komanduri, K-O-

M-A-N-D-U-R-I,” I added. I figured the 
roster was alphabetized by last name and 
hoped I could speed up the process for the 
teacher.

She still looked confused, and I felt my 

palms clam up more and more.

“Alright, go ahead and have a seat.”
I quietly let out a sigh of relief and made 

my way to the back of the classroom and 
allowed my heartbeat to return to a normal 
pace after having it beat out of my chest. 

As the session wrapped up, and I fran-

tically gathered my things to leave, the 
teacher stopped me.

“Oh, sweetie, could you hang back for a 

sec?”

I slowly paced over to her desk as all 

the other students made their way out 
the door, taking a final quick glance in my 
direction hoping to also hear or see why 
the teacher asked me to stay back. 

After what felt like ages of waiting, the 

teacher finally asked, “so you’re in sixth 
grade?”

“Yes.” Even with just my one word 

response, I heard my raspy voice tremble 
with fear.

“Hmm, okay, so that’s why your name 

isn’t on the roster here. This is a list of all 
of the eighth graders.”

I was instantly relieved. I let out a soft 

nervous chuckle before turning to leave. 
Before I could do so, the teacher followed 
up with one last request.

“Could you just give me your parents’ 

phone numbers?”

My eyebrows furrowed, and my mouth 

slightly opened. 

How often do teachers ask for your 

parents’ phone numbers? And either way, 
don’t they have access to them already? 
Isn’t there a directory for this sort of thing? 

Although I was hesitant, I didn’t want 

to pick a bone with a random teacher I’d 
never met.

“Like, our house phone number?”
“Yeah, that’d be great.”
I proceeded to monotonously recite 

our house phone number as the teacher 
scribbled it down on some white space at 
the top of the roster she was clutching onto 
before the meeting. Later that evening, my 
parents told me that they had received a 
call from that teacher.

My parents didn’t go into detail about 

the conversation that transpired, but they 
gave me the overview:

They exchanged pleasantries before 

the teacher jumped right into the meat of 
the conversation. This teacher said right 

away how she was confused as to why I 
was attending the information session as 
a sixth grader. My parents explained that 
they believed – and I believed – that I was 
ready to take a standardized test just for 
the experience. There was nothing in it 
for me other than the fact that I felt that 
I was ready. She immediately started to 
explain to us how she thought our parents 
were pushing us too hard. She said some-
thing along the lines of: “I don’t know why 
your people push your kids so hard.” And 
then continued, “my parents never pushed 
us that hard, and look at us — both my 
brother and I are extremely successful in 
our lives. I’m a teacher, and my brother is 
in the Army.”

My parents thanked her for calling and 

sharing her thoughts. They couldn’t help 
but simply laugh off the call. We didn’t even 
know where to start when she referred to 
our family as “your people,” insinuating a 
more sinister meaning. It’s a common ste-
reotype — misconception, rather — that 
Desi parents force their children into cer-
tain activities. In my case, this couldn’t be 
further from the truth. My parents have 
never forced me to do anything, let alone 
force me to go to an information session on 
standardized tests. To have a fully-grown 
adult woman use these microaggressions 
against our family is something I still have 
a difficult time processing. She thought 
that she had the right to dictate how our 
family runs things in our house. My par-
ents have aspirations for us that they’ve 
made countless sacrifices for, and for 
someone on the outside to come tell us that 
this shouldn’t be the way we run things 
was infuriating.

You see the title. You see the text. 

And if you’re busy, move onto what’s 
next. You might briefly skim, scan or 
scroll as many of us pay thousands 
to do with our college coursework. 
Nonetheless, if you do decide to read, 
for whatever sake, how long will it 
take? How closely will you try to com-
prehend, and to what end? 

Our world is ravaged by an unyield-

ing sense of urgency. So much so that 
reading four pages of text can feel like 
running four miles. But, then again, 
perhaps we are running. Running out 
of time, as we often claim to be. Yet 
how can you run out of that which 
you cannot see? Nor fully conceive? A 
myriad of machinations has led to this 
modern-day sensation of haste yet 
ultimately it is the forces of late-stage 
capitalism and their spiritually defi-
cient demarcations that have damned 
us to a life of hurry and hustle. 

Time and time again, the clock has 

been a ticking tool of capital. It is 
nearly impossible to envisage a time 
before modern mechanized clock 
time. From birth to death, we clutch 
tightly onto our clocks — our timepiec-
es and wristwatches, calendars and 

schedules. According to philosophy 
scholar Teresa I. Reed, the uniformi-
ty of clock time, aside from enabling 
the measurement of natural scien-
tific processes, has allowed for the 
synchronization of a series of human 
endeavors from school and labor, poli-
tics and religious affairs, sports and 

entertainment and beyond. In today’s 
time, the clock’s all-encompassing 
objectivity orders us to live a life in 

service to labor. To Reed, against 
the terrifying ticking of the clock it 
is evident that Capital becomes our 
God when “efficiency is the greatest 
virtue.” In our over-productive secu-
lar society, there is simply no time for 
the sacred which entreats us to con-
template the eternal. The competitive, 

commodity-fetishizing nature of late-
stage capitalism and its ever-increas-
ing imperatives to shorten labor time 

of production create ongoing conflicts 
and crises in the name of profit. 

Even our interaction time with 

each other is centered around com-
modity consumption. Our social lives 
are filled with costly commercial-
ized entertainment: driving, dining, 
drinking and drugs. As Cuban-French 
revolutionary Paul Lafargue claims, 
capitalism has manufactured within 
us as consumers an “excitement of 
appetites” and “creation of fictitious 
needs.” 

Of course, mechanized clock time 

does have its basis in the seasonal 
and biological changes of celestial 
and human bodies and the rhythms 
of day and night. The system of days, 
weeks and months is derived from the 
many ancient creation myths of the 
seven-day periods which correlate 
with celestial orbit and lunar cycles. 
As this orbit is eccentric (not always 
uniform) and subject to deviation, it 
becomes clear that our standardized 
system of time measurement is far 
from fact, far from exact. Yet it is not 
the function nor within the scope of 
clock time to accurately reflect the 
natural universe. Instead, it is largely 
used in society as a social mechanism 
to enact structural homogeneity.

Historian J. David Lewis and soci-

ology scholar Andrew J. Weigert 

assert that social time, as it’s been 
structured by clock time, carries with 
it a certain quality of “embeddedness, 
stratification, and synchronicity.” It is 
embedded in the sense that we have a 
general expectation for how we inter-
act with others during different time 
frames and the disruption of these 
expectations (transportation delays 
or transaction mishaps) can carry 
drastic implications. This sense of 
social time is embedded insofar as it is 
imposed upon us by the organization-
al structures of today which adhere 
to rigid patterns and procedures. 
To Lewis and Weigert, the immense 
schedulization of our daily activities 
(such as school and work) with pre-
cise time frames which ignore social 
and psychological realities stifles cre-
ativity and spontaneity and restricts 
us from living with fluidity. With 
clock time’s shortened finite units, 
we are constantly racing against the 
clock, running out of time. Lewis and 
Weigert state that “we not only expect 
rigorous temporal control of events 
but positively value it, as is evident 
from the anger and frustration felt 
when scheduled events are delayed, 
postponed, or cancelled.” Clearly, we 
remain suckers of the clock.

CONGRATULATIONS TO THE UM PHI BETA KAPPA CLASSES OF 2020 and 2021
CONGRATULATIONS TO THE UM PHI BETA KAPPA CLASSES OF 2020 and 2021

Phi Beta Kappa
Phi Beta Kappa is the oldest and most widely recognized scholarly honorary society in America. Founded in 1776 at the College of William and Mary, it celebrates excel-
lence in the liberal arts and sciences. The UM chapter, Alpha of Michigan, was founded in 1907 and inducted its hundred and twelfth and hundred and thirteenth classes 
into membership in the midst of Covid 19 in 2020 and 2021. We were not able to congratulate them publicly then. An invitation to join Phi Beta Kappa requires a history 
that an undergraduate in liberal arts and sciences can achieve. The Executive Committee of the Alpha of Michigan Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa recognizes and congratulates 
these recent members of this venerable society.

T

hanks to the compounded 
negative 
effects 
from 

multiple recent events, gas 

prices have surged across the country 
— averaging more than $4 a gallon as 
of April 10, 2022 — which has been 
cataclysmic for the average worker 
and the economy alike. Efforts by 
the United States and its allies to halt 
purchases of Russian oil to reprimand 
their invasion of Ukraine have been 
largely to blame for the skyrocketing 
prices. Most gas stations around the 
country have only two to three days 
of product in stock, and are therefore 
forced to charge customers what 
it will cost to refill their reserves, 
a concept known as “replacement 
cost.” 

However, gas prices have been 

steadily increasing in the United 
States since the initial stages of the 
coronavirus pandemic, when costs 
plummeted so much that they even 
briefly turned negative. As families 
sheltered in place at home, the 
average family’s driving was cut in 
half, according to AAA. This plunging 

gasoline demand resulted in OPEC 
and other oil-producing nations 
reducing production by 10% of the 
world’s supply. Once restrictions 
eased and families returned to work 
and school, demand for oil once again 
increased but could not be satisfied 
after 
significantly 
diminished 

production. Thus, gas prices began a 
steady upswing, rising to the extreme 
levels we are facing now. 

When President Biden took office 

in January 2021, prices had already 
reached $2.38 a gallon. Now, crude oil 
averages around $100 a barrel. While 
many have tried to point to Biden’s 
policies as a source for this surge, there 
is little to no evidence for this. As soon 
as he took office, Biden terminated 
the Keystone XL Pipeline, a decision 
that not only gained him his fair share 
of criticism but also signaled hostility 
to the oil industry. However, even if 
the Keystone Pipeline were in place 
today, the impact on prices would be 
measured in pennies. Prices would 
have continued to rise nevertheless. 

Biden’s staggeringly low approval 

ratings have necessitated lowering 
gas prices on a bipartisan level. 
While some politicians have called 
for suspending gas taxes, this short-

term solution would not only serve 
to be ineffective but would also 
betray our climate goals, as well as 
take away funds from Michigan’s 
transportation fund. As economists 
explain, “a full suspension of the 
gas tax would not lower the price of 
gasoline by the full amount of the tax 
because producers bear some of the 
tax burden.” What’s more, during 
past gas tax holidays in Indiana and 
Illinois, “researchers found that 
consumers don’t get the full benefit of 
the gas tax suspension; (rather,) some 
of their savings flow to oil producers.” 
A more effective short-term policy, 
proposed by Illinois, would instead 
freeze the gas tax at its current rate, 
allowing consumers to save millions 
of dollars while simultaneously 
honoring 
our 
country’s 
carbon 

neutrality commitment for 2050. 

Another short-term solution would 

be applying pressure on our country’s 
largest oil companies to incentivize 
drilling. Currently, around 9,950 
issued drilling permits are unused by 
oil corporations. Biden has accused 
these corporations of “sitting on” 

From The Daily: What to do 

about high gas prices

I

n July 2020, I purchased a 
pair of generic white New 
Balances. 
I 
loved 
those 

shoes. They fit right in with the 
rest of my modest wardrobe, and 
I was sad to throw them out this 
month, after almost two years of 
their distinguished service to my 
feet. 

I am not a fashionable person. 

I couldn’t even begin to describe 
what makes “good” or “bad” 
fashion sense. And yet, it appears 
that my seemingly inconsequential 
shoe choice coincided with the 
decline of a mid-2010s fashion 
trend, “normcore.” Popularized 
by 
“trend 
forecaster” 
Sean 

Monahan of the K-Hole collective, 
“Normcore, as it came to be 
understood, was about embracing 
the banality of plainness, of not 
being alternative, and of not 
seeking difference to affirm your 
individuality,” writes Donovan 
Barrett 
of 
Highsnobiety. 
By 

wearing New Balances, I had 
accomplished each of these goals 
— even if I did so without much 
grace. 

Unfortunately, I am still behind 

the curve. A year after I purchased 
those shoes, Monahan predicted 
on his Substack and in The Cut 
that American (read: millennial 
New Yorker) culture is already 
experiencing 
another 
“vibe 

shift.” Goodbye, he postulates, to 
Jerry Seinfeld’s bulky jackets and 
chunky sneakers. Welcome to the 
renaissance of Effy Stonem, indie 
sleaze and the end of the hyper-
digital, hyper-“cancel culture” 
era. 

After the profile in The Cut, 

the term “vibe shift” began to 
take shape in the media as an idea 
that extended beyond just fashion 
trends. 
Buzzfeed 
columnist 

Elamin Abdelmahmoud argues 
that “vibe shift” can also function 
as a framing device to analyze 
broad 
changes 
in 
American 

culture. In his opinion, the 
pandemic, 
anti-establishment 

Trump politics and now the war 
in Ukraine have all contributed to 
a decline in social trust. America’s 
democratic 
institutions 
are 

being challenged, and foreign 
countries are demonstrating that 
autocratic regimes will not easily 
capitulate, 
rebuffing 
political 

scientist 
Francis 
Fukuyama’s 

bold prediction that stable, liberal 
democracies would become the 
dominant world order. 

The “end of history” argument 

arose in response to the Soviet 
Union’s 
dissolution 
in 
1989. 

America believed, after the Cold 
War, that the project of liberal 
democracy had been vindicated as 
the supreme form of governance. 
However, as we have seen over 
the past two decades, efforts to 
democratize in other parts of the 
world have been overwhelmingly 
futile. It is amusing, therefore, 
that 
Generation 
Z 
would 

revitalize the late ’90s-Y2K-early 
2000s aesthetic in which that 
optimistic spirit was born. 

America then is unlike America 

now. In the late ’90s, the internet 
and other technological progress 
spurred 
an 
economic 
boom. 

Productivity soared, wages grew, 
incomes rose and, at the turn of 
the century, the unemployment 
rate dropped to 4%. In 2018, Neil 
Irwin of the New York Times 
wrote that the modern economy 
might be on a similar track 
towards ’90s-level growth. The 
labor market was (and still is) 
“tight,” which means the ratio of 
job openings to job seekers is high, 
and a persistently low interest 
rate has kept investors confident 
enough to keep pumping money 
into the stock market. 

Then, the pandemic happened. 

Investors remained optimistic 
and the stock market flourished, 
but the effects of the pandemic 
were not felt evenly among 
Americans. If positions could not 
go remote, people lost their jobs 
or were forced to put themselves 
at risk of contracting COVID-19. 
Fiscal stimulus measures from the 
Trump and Biden administrations 
helped keep people afloat, but 

now, after a little more than 
two years since the start of the 
pandemic, inflationary pressures 
have forced the Federal Reserve 
to begin raising the interest rate 
in an effort to prevent the post-
pandemic economy from spiraling 
out of control. 

It remains to be seen what effect 

raising the interest rate will have 
on the economy. Rate increases, if 
they happen too fast, can cause a 
recession. A potentially troubling 
development is that the yield 
curve, a measure of investment 
in U.S. government bonds, has 
inverted. This means that either 
investors are less confident in 
the U.S.’s long-term economic 
prospects, or, a more benign 
cause, the Fed’s decision to end its 
program of purchasing bonds is 
starting to affect the bond market. 

Even if the economy does not 

enter a post-pandemic recession, 
the economy will still be a vibe 
killer. Gen Z’s nostalgia for the 
turn of the century is harmless, 
as long as we simultaneously 
maintain a sober perspective 
on the economic direction of 
our country. When we leave the 
University of Michigan, we will 
not enter a housing market as hot 
as it was in the ’90s, especially 
if we don’t build more homes. 
And, if the precarious, stunted 
experience 
of 
the 
millennial 

generation is any indicator of 
what Gen Z will face as we 
lurch into adulthood, unabated 
optimism is not how I feel about 
life post-graduation. 

So, go ahead and buy that outfit 

you’ve saved on your Pinterest 
Y2K moodboard. Maybe don’t 
start smoking cigarettes again, 
something that I witnessed a 
group of assumedly freshmen do 
over the weekend. But as you ride 
the vibe shift’s wave, keep an ear 
to the ground (as I know we all do) 
and plan your economic future 
with prudence. It does not yet 
appear that the vibes of our time 
are spilling over into a speculative 
fervor on Wall Street, but we 
should be careful to not let that 
become our reality.

Don’t let the “vibe shift” warp 
your economic outlook

ALEX YEE

THE MICHIGAN DAILY 

EDITORIAL BOARD 

S

amsung has become what 
some would call a “meme” 
to Generation Z today. No 

matter how many new models 
come out, no matter how amazing 
their cameras are, no matter how 
easy their user interface becomes, 
they will never be able to infiltrate 
the technological culture of today’s 
youth. This is for one reason: Apple 
didn’t make themselves better 
than their competitors — they 
made it impossible to leave their 
web of interconnected products. 

The second you stop using 

an iPhone, you lose a world of 
capabilities as well. You can’t join a 
group chat with over 10 people. You 
can’t receive AirDropped pictures 
or send pictures to iCloud. Say 
goodbye to Apple Pay, iMessage, 
Apple Wallet and more. Good luck 
transferring your contacts and 
data with no iCloud and a new 
interface. There may be a million 
reasons that a new phone company 
transcends Apple, but they will 
never be able to hold a candle to 
Apple’s digital army. 

This quite literally captivating 

nature demonstrates the ways 
in which technology and social 
media companies have trapped us. 
As a young adult, it is impossible 
to live without an assortment of 
technology tools that have become 
as essential to us as food and 
water. In high school, I was the 
last of my friends to get Snapchat. 
A seemingly insignificant plight 
in today’s world, this one detail 
proved to be a large impediment in 
communicating with my peers. 

The modern world of flirting 

takes place increasingly online, 
and especially over Snapchat (ask 
any girl the last time a guy asked 
her for her actual number; I can 
guarantee she will have a hard 
time remembering). I watched 
as my friends “snapped” their 
love interests, made group chats 
and posted stories. All the while 
I watched from afar, in the social 
media-less jail I felt I was in. 

What people don’t tell you, 

however, is that this spectacular 
world of social media, led by 
the confines of Snapchat and 
Instagram, isn’t so glamorous 
after all. Those “guys” my friends 

were talking to were really just 
asking for nudes. Instagram wasn’t 
about promoting confidence, but 
instead tearing it down. This life 
was a numbers game: how many 
followers, how many likes, how 
many streaks, etc. 

So why do we do it? Why do we 

feed into a system that continually 
hurts us, tears us down and takes 
away from our face-to-face human 
connections with others? The 
answer isn’t in the allure of what 
these companies have to offer, 
or the factors — addictive colors, 
algorithms and even notification 
sounds — that keep you in. It’s in 
the reality of being unable to leave 
once you’ve entered. 

The way technology companies 

market, whether it be hardware 
(Apple, Samsung), cell service 
providers (AT&T, Verizon) or social 
media 
(Instagram, 
Snapchat), 

is making it harder and harder 
for you to leave. They’ve taken 
over communication. iMessage, 
Snapchat, Instagram and Tiktok

follows 
a 
young 
woman, 

Noa, through her newfound 
relationship with a supposed 
plastic 
surgeon, 
Steve. 
The 

relationship 
turns 
into 
a 

nightmare when Steve takes Noa 
to a remote house he owns, drugs 
her and locks her in a cell with 
other women who have fallen 
victim to Steve’s alluring nature. 
He proceeds to surgically remove 
her body parts piece by piece 
in order to keep the meat fresh, 
and subsequently sells them on 
the black market for purposes 
including anything from medical 
use to cannibalism. This practice 
has become commonly referred 
to as organ trafficking or the red 
market, where human body parts 
including organs, blood, bones, 
eggs and more are traded.

As I watched this movie, 

I found myself shocked and 
horrified to learn about this. 
Because 
the 
human 
organ 

market 
is 
an 
underground 

market, it is difficult to make 
any definitive estimates of its 
value. Journalist Scott Carney 
supposes it could be worth 
billions of dollars. There are 
estimates that 10% of all organ 
transplants are performed using 
trafficked organs. 

Similar to the events in 

“Fresh,” selling body parts as a 
commodity is often involuntary 
and typically preys on society’s 
most vulnerable populations. 
In 2008, for instance, 17 people 
were freed from India’s “blood 
farm.” The scheme began with 
the luring of poor migrants to 
a house with the promise of 
employment, but the promised 
job turned out to be $7 per unit 
of blood they gave. The victims 
initially participated willingly, 
but when they wanted to leave 
they were so weakened by the 

blood loss they could not. The 
migrants were then beaten and 
kept in cages in the house for two 
and half years, being forced to 
give blood multiple times a week 
with no benefit or payment. The 
Red Cross recommends waiting 
at least 8 weeks between blood 
donations, which further proves 
how exploitative this behavior 
was. 

While many transactions on 

the red market are involuntary, 
there are times when people 
voluntarily sell their body parts. 
However, this is often because 
they are in situations of great 
financial 
pressure. 
Carney 

describes 
these 
markets 
as 

taking health and resources away 
from the poor and funneling 
them upwards through social 
classes. 
For 
example, 
after 

a 2004 tsunami in India, an 
emerging Indian refugee camp 
quickly gained the nickname 
of Kidneyville because of the 
high proportion of desperate 
refugees who sold their kidneys. 

Despite 
often 
being 
aware 

they were being scammed, the 
refugees proceeded with the 
surgeries because it was their 
only option. I am left to wonder, 
are voluntary organ sales truly 
voluntary if the seller is in a 
situation of desperation?

In light of these involuntary 

and 
voluntary 
organ 
sales, 

the 
similarities 
between 

organ trafficking and human 
trafficking are not absent. In 
fact, most countries include 
organ 
trafficking 
in 
their 

definition of human trafficking. 
The United States and Canada, 
however, do not. 

In both forms of trafficking, 

the 
perpetrators 
prey 
on 

society’s most helpless members. 
For either form of trafficking, 
participation 
is 
typically 

involuntary. Additionally, the 
perpetrators are the benefactors 
in human and organ trafficking, 
not the victims. These markets 
flourish because the economics 
of organ donation support such 

activities, as there is a low supply 
of organs and high demand for 
the much-needed commodity. 

The ability to stop organ 

trafficking is difficult — if not 
impossible — because there 
is not a substantial amount 
of 
evidence 
to 
work 
with 

regarding the topic. As a result, 
the problem of organ trafficking 
does not get the attention that 
human trafficking does. 

The information that does 

exist rarely reaches the hands of 
those able to act, such as judicial 
authorities and law enforcement 
authorities. Many times these 
crimes are not even reported 
or known to have occurred. 
There is a great web of criminal 
networks, 
collusion 
within 

hospitals and manipulation of 
medical insurers that must be 
further investigated before any 
productive action can be taken. 

In order to end these crimes 

against 
humanity, 
society 

must develop a better system 
for monitoring and tracking 

organ donations. This could 
take the form of following the 
money 
path, 
implementing 

more severe punishments for 
these crimes and increasing 
the amount of funds spent on 
research and prevention. The 
United Nations Office on Drugs 
and Crime asserts the need 
for a strengthened response, 
which would include increased 
evidence-based 
knowledge, 

raised 
awareness 
amongst 

target groups and improved 
legislative and non-legislative 
measures. 

For me, it took watching the 

horrors of organ trafficking 
in action through the movie 
“Fresh” to realize how very 
real the problem is. This only 
goes to show how simple it is 
to increase awareness, whether 
that is through a movie or even 
the words you are reading right 
now. Whatever way you choose 
to gain insight, remember it is 
never too late for change and 
action.

R

ussia’s 
invasion 
of 

Ukraine 
has 
rightly 

generated international 

outcry 
and 
condemnation. 

The 
war 
is 
clearly 
an 

imperial action, with Putin 
denying the very existence 
of the Ukrainian people and 
explicitly attempting to make 
Ukraine a part of Russia. The 
consequences 
are 
horrific. 

Russian forces have killed or 
injured thousands of civilians 
and have committed a number 
of atrocities that are likely war 
crimes, including destroying 
the maternity and children’s 
wards of a prenatal hospital, 
cluster bombing a preschool, 
dropping 
landmines 
on 
a 

civilian 
escape 
route 
and 

executing civilians. 

As of March 24, the invasion 

had 
displaced 
10 
million 

people, 
“the 
fastest 
and 

largest displacement of people 
in Europe since World War II.” 
A wide variety of groups have 
rightly demanded that Russia 
immediately end its attack 
and 
completely 
withdraw 

its forces. Afterward, Russia 
must be held accountable for 
its actions.

The 
vital 
attention 
to 

and support for Ukrainians 
comparatively highlights the 
widespread lack of such a 
stance 
toward 
Palestinians’ 

decades-long fight for self-
determination. 
The 
world 

largely stands by as Palestinians 
are 
bombed, 
murdered, 

imprisoned, 
evicted 
and 

maimed; as Palestinian human 
rights groups are banned as 
“terrorist” organizations; and 
as Palestinians are forced to 
live under apartheid — a crime 
against humanity according 
to 
international 
law. 
The 

primary Palestinian liberation 
movement 
— 
the 
Boycott, 

Divestment, 
and 
Sanctions 

Movement — has been falsely 
labeled, 
by 
The 
Jerusalem 

Declaration On Antisemitism, 
as inherently antisemitic and 
therefore oppressive.

To many, the situations in 

Ukraine and Palestine are so 
different as to be incomparable. 
And clearly, the situations have 
many differences, including the 
fact that Ukraine is a member 
state of the United Nations, 
whereas the State of Palestine 
is a non-member observer state. 
However, this legal difference 
has nothing to do with the 
basic right of all peoples to 
self-determination. 
In 
fact, 

Russia’s denial of Ukrainian 
statehood 
underscores 
how 

recognition of this right is 
ultimately 
political. 
If 
we 

accept that all peoples have 
the right to choose their own 
destinies, then we must be as 
insistent and urgent in our 
support for Palestinians as we 
are for Ukrainians.

The University of Michigan’s 

actions demonstrate that it is 
not committed to respecting 
the right of all peoples to self-
determination. On March 15, 
the University announced that 
it would divest from Russia 
after 
Ukrainian 
students 

submitted an open letter calling 
for divestment (as well as aid to 

displaced Ukrainian scholars 
and 
students 
and 
support 

for students and employees 
from 
Belarus 
and 
Russia). 

By contrast, the University 
has long refused to divest 
from companies that violate 
Palestinian 
human 
rights, 

despite decades of advocacy 
by the Palestinian solidarity 
group 
Students 
Allied 
for 

Freedom and Equality and its 
allies. 

When 
Central 
Student 

Government passed resolution 
A.R. 7-109 in 2017, asking 
the University to appoint a 
committee that would simply 
consider 
divestment 
from 

companies doing business with 
Israel, the University refused, 
saying that the purpose of the 
endowment was “to generate 
the greatest possible income.” 
This was an explicit statement 
that 
the 
University 
values 

profit 
over 
people, 
which 

remains 
the 
University’s 

position on divestment from 
Israel to this day. And yet it 
took less than three weeks for 
the University to announce an 
explicitly politically-motivated 
divestment from Russia.

None of this is to attempt 

to 
minimize 
the 
atrocities 

being 
perpetrated 
against 

Ukrainians. Rather, this is a call 
to recognize that the urgency 
we rightly feel to support 
Ukrainian self-determination 
must also be applied toward the 
liberation of Palestinians and 
other oppressed peoples. We 
must fight as passionately for 
Palestinian self-determination 
as we fight for Ukrainian self-
determination. 
Indeed, 
we 

need only look to Palestine, 
the Native American lands now 
known as the United States 
and other colonized regions of 
the globe to see what Ukraine 
might look like if Ukrainians’ 
right to self-determination is 
not defended and upheld.

Fortunately, 
Palestinian, 

Native 
American, 
Black, 

Latinx and Asian students have 
already done significant work 
to identify concrete ways that 
the University can support the 
liberation of all peoples. The 
Students of Color Liberation 
Front, composed of a variety 
of racial justice organizations 
on campus, has articulated 
a 
unified 
set 
of 
anti-

racist 
demands 
addressing 

pedagogy, 
curriculum, 

faculty hiring (including a 
demand for the creation of a 
Palestinian Studies Scholar/
Chair), student support and 
recruitment, 
divestment, 

policing and more. 

Nineteen 
campus 

organizations and over 200 
individuals 
cosigned 
these 

demands, but the University 
has yet to implement or take 
meaningful action toward most 
of them. Ukrainian students 
are also currently identifying 
ways that the University can 
support 
Ukrainian 
students 

and scholars through remote 
education, 
emergency 

admissions 
and 
material 

support. 
By 
implementing 

these plans, the University has 
an opportunity to become an 
institution that respects the 
human rights of all people and 
peoples. The only question is 
whether it will.

Charles Hilu was contacted 

for comment in advance of this 
Op-Ed’s publication.
T

ruth,” 
“accuracy” 
and 

“objectivity” 
are 
the 

pillars 
of 
journalistic 

ethics. Sadly, it is clear that 
Charles Hilu, and The Michigan 
Review as a whole, do not uphold 
these cornerstones. In his article, 
Hilu took it upon himself to 
personally attack, misrepresent 
and degrade me, as a means to 
push his own racist agenda, all 
without ever once contacting 
nor reaching out to me. Hilu 
was supposedly responding to a 
letter which I addressed to the 
University’s Board of Regents, 
but it is clearly apparent that Hilu 
did not read my letter, or rather, 
his white privilege blinded him 
from seeing anything other than 
his fallacious interpretation of it. 

It’s one thing to utilize the 

power of the pen to uphold facts, 
and bring forth positive change 
within society, yet it is another 
to abuse said power to attack, 
defame and weaponize words 
against someone with whom 
you were not even bold enough 
to confront and have an actual 
conversation with. Many who 
have read the fallacious article 
attacking my character, most 
definitely have a few words 
in mind to describe Hilu: A 
cowardly racist student hiding 
behind their white privilege. 

Unfortunately, 
cowardly 

racism, 
white 
privilege 
and 

misleading quotes are far too 
common on this campus. One 
thing that was accurate within 
the article is that yes, I am a Black 
man. However I fear no man — 
in fact it would behoove Hilu to 
name one white student upon this 
campus whom I’m threatened 
by, seeing that in his article he 
stated that I was “threatened by 
white students.” In response to 
that fallacious statement, I quote 
one of my favorite scriptures: 
“The Lord is on my side; I will 
not fear: what can man do unto 
me?” Utilizing racist undertones, 
Hilu 
has 
compromised 
my 

safety as a Black student on this 
predominantly white campus. 
To that, I say I will not waiver 
nor fold, and I will continue to 
stand and fight for equity and 
dismantling racism of all forms, 
especially on this campus! 

In the article, Hilu begged the 

question: “If there are too many 
white people in a certain place, 
the solution is to remove them. 
How does the University do this? 
Should it release a statement 
saying 
white 
people 
are 

unwelcome in a campus space 
that their tuition and tax dollars 
fund?” The Trotter Multicultural 
Center, as it is known today, 
began as “Trotter House,” a Black 
Student Cultural Center. African 
American students united under 
the Black Action Movement 

(BAM) to help students who 
experienced 
obstacles 
within 

their 
educational 
process. 

“Trotter House” was birthed out 
of this movement, founded at a 
rambling old house on the corner 
of 
South 
University 
Avenue 

and 
East 
University 
Avenue 

and named in honor of William 
Monroe Trotter. 

As Hilu writes, yes, Dr. King 

did in fact have a dream, but I can 
assure you that his dream was 
not to be misrepresented, nor 
to have his words weaponized 
by cowardly racists trying to 
tear down a Black man. Since he 
likes quotes, however, here is one 
from James Baldwin: “I am not 
your negro!”

His colorblind theory solidifies 

Hilu’s racist nature, and the fact 
that he most definitely skipped 
his Race and Ethnicity Class 
requirement. Not only that, but 
it disappointed me that after 
coming to him as an adult, face 
to face, following the release of 
his article, his energy completely 
changed, thus further solidifying 
the cowardice that comes with 
attacking an individual behind 
a pen. The next time that you 
plan to weaponize words against 
me or anyone on this campus, at 
least have the gall to reach out to 
those whom you are attacking. 
Trotter Center would not be 
here without the activism and 
contributions of Black students 
on this campus. 

To the readers, I would also 

let it be known that I did not 
shed one tear in this incident, as 
Hilu himself confirmed when I 
personally addressed him about 
said remark. Funny how racists’ 
energy 
changes 
when 
those 

whom they attack confront them.

Michigan cruises to 4-0 victory over Purdue

COLE MARTIN

Daily Sports Writer

Since 2000, the Michigan men’s 

tennis team has posted a 20-4 
record against Purdue. And on 
Saturday, the Wolverines’ winning 
ways over the Boilermakers con-
tinued:

They dominated.
For over a month, that word 

has described the Wolverines who 
entered Saturday having won 11 
straight matches. And from the 
match’s very start, it was clear that 
that description would remain the 
same.

Extending its win streak to 12 

matches, No. 6 Michigan (15-2 
overall, 5-0 Big Ten) defeated Pur-
due (8-10, 1-3), 4-0, behind a solid 
all-around effort that left little 
doubt surrounding the outcome.

Yet despite their impressive 

accomplishments on the court, the 
Wolverines are taking it match-by-
match.

“We don’t talk about a win 

streak,” Michigan coach Adam 
Steinberg said. “We talk about just 
playing for each other and taking 
this individual sport we have and 
making it a team sport.”

And by playing as a team against 

Purdue, the Wolverines were able 
to enjoy great success in all aspects 
of Saturday’s match.

In doubles play, Michigan set 

the tone early thanks to a strong 
effort from fifth-year senior Nick 
Beaty and freshman Will Cook-
sey. Behind their impressive vol-
leys at the net, Beaty and Cooksey 
imposed their will on their oppo-
nents, defeating them, 6-1, to earn 
the Wolverines the first of two 
wins necessary for the doubles 
point.

“We put Nick with (Cooksey) to 

lead him and show him the way,” 
Steinberg said. “It gave Will a sense 
of comfort.”

The tandem of junior Ondrej 

Styler and sophomore Gavin Young 
continued the Wolverines’ fero-
cious pace at the net, clinching 
a victory through an impressive 
overhead shot by Young that left 
their opponents helpless.

Young 
and 
Styler’s 
victory 

clinched the second requisite 
match for Michigan to win the 
doubles point, the team’s 15th of 
the season. And the Wolverines, 
yet again, got off to a fast start with 
a 1-0 lead.

In singles play, the thread of 

dominance never faltered. 

Styler quickly dispatched his 

opponent, led by an impressive 
shot out of his opponent’s reach 
to win the first set, 6-1. In the sec-
ond set, Styler trailed, 2-1, before 
propelling himself to a five-game 
winning streak, clinching his ninth 
straight victory and opening up a 
2-0 lead for Michigan.

Beaty, fresh off of a decisive 

doubles victory, captured his 11th 
consecutive win in straight sets 
over his opponent, controlling the 
pace throughout the match. Beaty’s 
opponent won three games total 
over the two sets, and the Wolver-
ines jumped out to a commanding 
3-0 lead.

To cap off Michigan’s outing, 

sophomore Nino Ehrenschneider 
emulated his teammates’ success. 
Ehrenschneider made quick work 
of his opponent in the first set, 
blanking him, 6-0, before pulling 
away in a closer second set for a 6-3 
victory. That win earned the Wol-
verines the 4-0 victory and their 
eighth shutout of the season.

But even throgh all its individual 

success, Steinberg is adamant that 
Michigan’s hot streak is in part due 

to its identity as a team.

“We play the Michigan way … 

(we) play for each other,” Steinberg 

said. “And when we … play together 
(as) a great team, we’re very, very 
tough to beat.”

And with the postseason fast 

approaching, the Wolverines have 
a chance to prove that all the more.

JENNA HICKEY/Daily 

Michigan continued its strong season with its win over Purdue.

Though the No. 6 Michigan 

men’s tennis team started by win-
ning the doubles point, the true 
start of Sunday’s match was high-
lighted by sophomore Nino Ehren-
schneider. 

The Wolverines have been 

steadily gathering winning streaks 
throughout the season, including 
five of their top players have ris-
ing streaks of five or more singles 
matches. It’s safe to say that their 
preparation for the Big Ten Tour-
nament is progressively reaching 
its culmination, and their match-
ups against Indiana are proof of 
that.

The Hoosiers learned how dan-

gerous it is to lose the first singles 
match to Michigan. The Wolver-
ines gathered three team points 
within minutes of each other and 
rolled through the majority of its 
individual matches to dominate 
Indiana, 6-1, just weeks before the 
Big Ten Tournament. 

“Clinching the first point, get-

ting on the board, it’s a big confi-
dence boost for the whole team,” 
Styler said. “On the other side (of 

SportsWednesday: Frozen Four 

loss marks the end of an era

LANE KIZZIAH

Daily Sports Writer

You can call it a squandered 

moment, a string of unlucky 
bounces or being at the wrong 
place at the wrong time. 

Whatever you want to call it, 

Michigan’s Thursday night Fro-
zen Four loss marked the end of 
an era. 

Going into the beginning of 

the season, the Wolverines were 
hailed as one of the top contend-
ers for a national championship. 
Michigan had four of the top five 
NHL Draft picks on its roster. It 
was ranked third in the USCHO 
preseason poll. 

And, for the most part, the Wol-

verines seemed poised to live up 
to those high expectations. They 
finished the season with a 16-8 
conference record and a Big Ten 
Tournament title. Michigan skat-
ed past American International, 
5-3, in the first round of the NCAA 
Tournament and dropped Quin-
nipiac, 7-4, in the second. 

“When you fast forward the 

tape here, in five or seven years, 
when you can see this thing play 
out, you may be looking at one of 
the best college hockey teams ever 
assembled,” American Interna-
tional coach Eric Lang said after 
losing to Michigan in the first 
round of the Tournament. 

You might not have to fast for-

ward all that far to see how rare 
— and fleeting — this team’s talent 
really was. 

Following last season, specula-

tion arose over whether sopho-
more forwards Matty Beniers and 
Kent Johnson would come back to 
Michigan, along with sophomore 
defenseman Owen Power, who 
would become only the second 
No. 1 draft pick to defer the jump 
to the NHL since 2000. But all 

three returned, helping build one 
of the most lauded college hockey 
teams ever assembled.

Now, all three have signed NHL 

contracts. Though next year’s ros-
ter could still feature a wealth of 
NHL-level talent, it won’t be the 
same generational lineup that took 
the ice this year.

Even beyond that roster shake-

up, the Wolverines stand on shaky 
ground this offseason. Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson’s five-year 
contract expires on April 30. Over-
shadowing the contract negotia-
tions is the pending investigation 
for toxic workplace culture, gen-
der-based discrimination, retalia-
tion against a student athlete and 
COVID-19 deception. 

Despite Pearson’s impressive 

resumé — which includes two Fro-
zen Four appearances and a Big 
Ten Tournament win — the alle-
gations may prove too serious to 
overcome. 

“I work under the direction of 

the athletic director (Warde Man-
uel) and the Board of Regents,” 
Pearson told the Daily. “So if 

they’re willing to have me back, 
that’s the plan.”

The investigation, which began 

in October 2021, didn’t seem to 
impact the team’s performance 
this season, but it remains to be 
seen whether the controversies — 
or Pearson’s potential departure 
— will have an impact on players’ 
decisions of whether or not to stay 
with the program. None of the 
drafted players were made avail-
able after Thursday’s loss.

There are certain Michigan 

teams that set the bar for all to fol-
low: the Fab Five in 1991, the soft-
ball team in 2005, the 1997 football 
team, last season’s women’s gym-
nastics team. 

When you fast forward not-

so-far down the line, you’ll likely 
be adding the 2021-22 Michigan 
hockey team to that list. Despite 
the fact that the Wolverines 
failed to live up to their mile-high 
expectations — expectations they 
undoubtably had the talent to meet 
— they’ve still set a bar unlikely to 
be met by the currently shaky pro-
gram anytime soon.

the court) too, seeing it on the 
board — it helps everyone.”

This accomplishment is made 

possible because of the Wolver-
ines’ depth, which is illuminated 
by the bountiful win streaks sur-
rounding the team. Ehrenschnei-
der and senior Ondrej Styler were 
perfect examples of the high-level 
competition. It was these two wins 
that truly set the team on the path 
it needed to clinch the win against 
the Hoosiers, elevating Michigan’s 
winning streak to 13 matches.

Ehrenschneider, who won the 

first match, was playing off of the 
momentum of Styler from the 
start. Side-by-side, the two of them 
swept through their first sets. Of 
the two, Ehrenschneider (with 
a six-game streak) was the first 
to finish with a decisive 6-2 set, 
which paved the way for the rest 
of the match and set the stage for 
Styler (with a 10-game streak), who 
found victory in his match mere 
moments after.

With the two individual win-

ning streaks elevated once more, 
they were able to gather the 
momentum they needed to uplift 
the rest of the team and guarantee 
success against the Hoosiers, only 
losing the one singles match.

“It’s not a surprise to us that 

we have a winning streak,” Styler 
said.

The Wolverines are confident 

in their ability to dominate their 
opponents, and have found a large 
amount of success doing exactly 
that throughout the season. No 
matter what opponent they have 
faced, they have undoubtedly 
shown that they are prepared to 
find postseason success. 

The ability to gain confidence 

off of each other has led Michigan 
to multiple triumphs over high-
level competition. Its wins against 
No. 1 Texas Christian and No. 2 
Ohio State are a testament to that.

Coach Adam Steinberg believes 

that the current team is stepping 
up its game. Following the wave of 
achievements, there is no reason 
to change the formula. Instead, 
the Wolverines need to keep mov-
ing forward one game at a time.

“Every match in the Big Ten 

is like a tournament,” Steinberg 
said. “Now, we’re in the seventh 
round.”

And as the rounds get deep-

er, Michigan’s singles winning 
streaks continue to grow longer.

against rival Ohio State.

After a slow start that led to a 

four-goal deficit at the end of the 
first period, the Wolverines needed 
a spark. And with two captains out 
with injuries, they found energy 
from their bench. 

But the comeback led by fresh-

man midfielder Jill Smith and 
senior attacker Claire Galvin fell 
short as Michigan (9-5 overall, 1-3 
Big Ten) lost to the Buckeyes (9-4, 
2-1), 9-7.

After a disappointing loss against 

Southern California last weekend, 
the Wolverines were hoping to play 
four periods of consistent lacrosse 
— something that has been a bit of a 
struggle lately. 

“You can’t expect to play 45 

minutes and win in the Big Ten,” 
Michigan coach Hannah Nielsen 
said. “Last game we started fast and 
ended slow, this game we started 
slow and ended OK. The message 
is to figure out what you got to do to 
maintain a consistent level, whether 
it’s mental lapses or if it’s physical 
fatigue.”

That slow start was a scoreless 

first six minutes until Ohio State 
broke the game open and Michi-
gan, looking lost, couldn’t match the 
Buckeyes’ production. The Wolver-
ines were outshot 11-5 in the first 
period and they needed someone to 
step up. 

That appeared to be Smith and 

Galvin.

After a goal from freshman mid-

fielder Julia Schwabe got Michigan 
on the scoreboard, Smith added 
one of her own, waking up both the 
crowd and her team as momentum 
started to shift. 

But down 5-2 going into the half, 

the Wolverines needed more.

Smith scored her second goal 

three minutes into the half, and 
after Ohio State answered, Galvin 
chipped in with two of her own, 
trimming the Buckeyes’ lead to one. 

As the Wolverines narrowed the 

gap, the tension on the field ampli-
fied and players started getting 
chippy. In the final six-and-a-half 
minutes of the third period, each 
team had a yellow card while trad-
ing a total of five fouls.

A Buckeye goal with 90 seconds 

left before the break brought Michi-
gan’s deficit back to two heading 
into the final period of play. 

Intense Wolverine defense kept 

Ohio State at bay for the first few 
minutes of the fourth period, but 
the Buckeyes scored another goal, 
widening the gap Michigan was 
hoping to close.

Just three minutes later, Galvin 

scored her third goal of the game, 
her second hat trick of the season 
and her first during conference play, 
bringing the deficit back to two. As 
yet another key goal from a bench 
player gave the Wolverines a much-
needed spark, Ohio State called 
timeout, fearing a momentum shift.

Out of the timeout, the inten-

sity of both teams increased as they 
traded shots, defensive stands and 
fouls. 

The Buckeyes struck next with 

a man-up goal after a Michigan 
yellow card, but the Wolverines 
answered two minutes later with a 
goal from senior midfielder Kaitlyn 

Mead, a consistent force for Michi-
gan all season.

The Wolverines played the final 

100 seconds of the game with an 
intensity that had been lacking 
earlier. They got a couple of good 
opportunities out of the free posi-
tion, but they just couldn’t capital-
ize.

As Michigan hopes to get back to 

the dominance it started the season 
with, its bench production provides 
a potential blueprint. 

“(Galvin) does really well against 

zone; she’s a very smart player, a 
great off-ball player, sees lanes and 
had a great day shooting today,” 
Nielsen said. “Jill (Smith) as well, 
really in one of her first games play-
ing two-way midfield, for her to step 
up in the absence of some key play-
ers I thought was a positive sign.”

But for the team to get back into 

the win column, the Wolverines 
will have to get back to playing four 
consistent periods of lacrosse.

Michigan falls 

to Denver in Frozen 

Four overtime thriller

SPORTSWEDNESDAY

B

OSTON — As the Michigan 
hockey team’s skaters lined up 
along the goal line prior to the 

game, each one exuded a calm about 
themselves. Standing side by side, their 

relaxed auras made 

it seem as though 

they were about 
to 
play 
any 

other 
game. 

And just as 
throughout 
the 
season, 

one-by-one, the 
starters 
were 

called 
to 
skate 

forward. 
But 
this 
time, 

they were being called to 

something 
greater. 
Called 

to compete for a spot in the 
National 
Championship. 

Called for a chance to write 
their names into the history 
books. 

Upon hearing their names 

called, each skater sprinted 
to the blue line before lifting 
up the front end of a skate, 
slowly bringing them to 

a stop — hoping their 

season 
wouldn’t 

come to a halt as 
well.

Already 
lined 

up on the other blue 
line, Denver heard 
a 
similar 
— 
but 

opposite 
— 
call. 

Called to thwart 
Michigan’s season. 
Called to propel 
themselves 
into 
the 

championship. 
Called to send 
the Wolverines’ 
stars into the 
NHL empty-
handed in the 
process. 

And 
it 

was 
the 

Pioneers 

who answered the call. 

In the Frozen Four, the Wolverines 

(31-10-1 overall) fell to Denver (30-9-1), 
3-2, in a down-to-the-wire overtime bout, 
ending their Big Ten and NCAA Regional 
Championship season short of their 
ultimate goal. Michigan failed to reach 
a National Title, and was left standing in 
TD Garden able to do nothing but look up 
towards the summit of college hockey.

“(Denver’s) just structurally really 

good defensively,” Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson said. “Everybody thought that 
this might be a high-scoring game, but 
both teams played solid defensively. … 
They really made it difficult on us.”

That defense kept the game tight, 

forcing an overtime session to decide the 
victor. Overtime transitioned from tactful 
neutral zone battles to track-style high-
speed chases down the ice that created 
multiple grade-A chances. 

With six minutes left in overtime, 

the Wolverines got their best chance to 
send the Pioneers packing. Freshman 
defenseman Luke Hughes used his 

signature speed to create a 2-on-1 attempt, 
but was rejected by goaltender Magnus 
Chrona from point-blank range. 

Only a minute later, that missed 

opportunity 
came 
back 
to 
haunt 

Michigan. 
Senior 
forward 
Jimmy 

Lambert and sophomore defenseman 
Jacob Truscott both went for the puck 
near their own blue line to try and spark 
yet another breakaway off a blocked 
Denver shot. They hesitated slightly — 
unsure which one would take the puck — 
leading them both to miss it and allow the 
Pioneers to regain possession. 

From there, the puck ended up in the 

corner, where a pass into the slot found 
forward Carter Savoie. Savoie launched 
the puck at sophomore goaltender Erik 
Portillo, who slid to his right to make the 
initial season-saving stop.

But it didn’t matter. 
The 
save 
depositioned 
Portillo, 

allowing Savoie to secure his own 
rebound and pop the game-winning goal 
into the net, beating Portillo and his last 

ditch effort to get back in the crease from 
the splits. 

“(Michigan) had a couple really good 

shifts there in that overtime,” Savoie said. 
“I think our whole group did a really good 
job weathering it, not giving up that next 
goal. And then we found a way to put that 
one in.” 

Just as the goal finalized Denver’s 

control, it was the Pioneers who took early 
control of the high-stakes affair, striking 
first and holding the Wolverines without 
a shot on net throughout the first 16-plus 
minutes. Michigan, though, got itself 
settled in as the second period began. 

And four minutes into the second, the 

Wolverines broke even. Although the 
Pioneers’ effective net-out poke checking 
continued to give Michigan fits, Chrona’s 
poke check on a Wolverines attack ended 
up back in Michigan’s control, setting up a 
Lambert goal. 

The game-tying goal quickened the 

game’s pace, and as Denver continued on 
its first-period offensive aggression, the 
Wolverines followed suit. 

The 
Wolverines’ 
bounce-back 

response from the first period to the 
second was reciprocated in the third. 
Just as the Pioneers looked like they’d 
skate towards victory with a redirect 
goal by forward Cameron Wright six 
minutes into the third period, Michigan 
responded only four minutes later with 
sophomore forward Thomas Bordeleau’s 
goal setting the scene for the dramatic 
overtime ending. 

“You have to be good, and you need a 

little bit of luck,” Pearson said, reflecting 
on his past postseason runs. “We just 
didn’t seem to have any lady luck on our 
side tonight.”

No matter how talented a team is, the 

Frozen Four brings out the best of the best. 
Each team is good enough to win it all, but 
only one can. Michigan made mistakes, 
and so did Denver. The Pioneers were 
lucky enough to make one less mistake in 
a game with no margin for error. 

So on Thursday, the Wolverines ran 

out of luck. And on Saturday, while the 
Pioneers take the ice, Michigan will 
watch the National Championship from 
home.

In this special edition, we’ve challenged the Statement writers to ‘dive’ in and immerse them-

selves in new experiences on campus. The result: a collection of testimonials shedding light on 
the campus’s less-explored marvels, from pole dancing to fencing to architecture hunting. And 

the Daily’s Photo team was there to capture it all.

Content warning: Restrictive eating habits 
“Now let’s get acquainted with that pole.”
After completing several warm-up exercises 

— wide-leg squats, downward dog, plank shoulder-
taps, anything to bring our heart rates up — we had 
arrived at the long-awaited activity, the reason we 
were all in that room on a dark Wednesday evening.

We were there to dance.
At the direction of our instructor, Sophia, each of 

the dozen people in the room approached the silver 
bar before them. From my position at the back right 
corner of the room, I had a clear view of the rest of the 
class, how each person neared their pole with differ-
ent levels of comfort and familiarity depending on 
their level of experience. 

Everyone had on the layers of clothing they were 

comfortable with: biker shorts, tank tops and sports 
bras were the most common pieces, mirroring my 
own spandex shorts and tie-up Michigan tank. The 
long mirror at the front of the room reflected every-
thing I was seeing before me, giving us the chance to 
analyze our moves and our bodies should we dare to 
look.

The room was dark, especially in my corner of 

the studio — the black skies just beyond the wall of 
windows directly to my right provided little light. 
But there was a bright glow from the light fixture 
shining from the sloped ceiling at the center of the 
room, shining directly over the tallest pole extending 
up into the peak of the roof above us. It was enough 
to illuminate the space, the resulting shadows simply 
added to the alluring, thrilling atmosphere.

I wiped my pole down with a small black towel, 

preparing myself for the real work we were about 
to begin. Following Sophia’s example, I stepped to 
the left of the pole, stretched on the tips of my toes, 

and reached my right arm high above me. I grasped 
the metal bar and nervously, excitedly awaited our 
instructor’s guidance.

And then we began.

***

I have had a complex relationship with my body 

throughout my life. As a former competitive volley-
ball player, I constantly pushed it to its limits in terms 
of what athletic feats it could accomplish, how per-
fectly it could execute whatever movement I needed 
it to do. 

Before settling on volleyball, I had tried my hand 

at nearly every sport popular in America: soccer, 
baseball, softball, lacrosse and skating. This excite-
ment about physical activity hasn’t wavered since 
entering college. I constantly seek out new athletic 
opportunities as I’m confident in my body’s ability to 
adapt and excel — and I’m proud of my dedication to 
honing its abilities.

As a result of my intimate relationship with my 

body, I’ve experienced equal amounts of frustration 
and insecurity. It’s a common assumption — and 
simply an accurate statistic — that volleyball play-
ers are generally supposed to be tall, lean and toned. 
Many of my teammates throughout my life have 
possessed these features, traits that contrast with 
my average height, my curvy and more muscular 
build. So standing next to my teammates, I always 
felt I was lacking.

The dichotomy of appreciation and distaste for 

my body for years prevented me from creating a 
peaceful relationship with it. My insecurities fol-
lowed me to the University of Michigan, and while 
I outwardly owned my curves, my mind was always 
at war with itself, never able to decide if I was being 
truthful about my outward confidence or not. 

To our readers:
In last week’s the Statement edition, the design featured under the “Our Uncanny Reality” piece involved a piece of text that made the ableist insinuation that pros-
thetic hands carry an unsettling connotation. We apologize for our negligence in overlooking the printing of this piece of text. The Daily wholeheartedly condemns able-
ism in all of its forms. The design has been updated accordingly on the digital version of the “Our Uncanny Reality” piece found on our website.

Then the pandemic reared its ugly head into our 

lives. Where I had previously been used to intensive, 
daily three-hour practices, I had to decide on my 
own how I would remain active while attending 
Zoom University. I exercised every day with HIIT 
or strength workouts. I felt guilty for eating anything 
unhealthy, as though eating one cookie would com-
pletely change my physique.

But this year, my second year at the University, my 

mindset has shifted. I’ve been able to explore more 
of college life as the pandemic slowly eases, alleviat-
ing some of the mental health challenges of COVID-
19. I’ve engaged more with the ways I can display 
my body to the level that I’m comfortable with. I’ve 
experimented with more revealing clothing on 
nights out and bared more skin during my workouts. 
I’ve been able to go out and attend social functions 
that have allowed me to get to know myself and my 
image.

I’ve never known the confidence I have in my 

body now, and it took years to arrive at this point. 
I still experience insecurity, as everyone does, but 
these dark thoughts are much rarer than they were 
when I was younger, comparing my physique with 
that of my volleyball teammates.

In college, I seek to celebrate this pride in both 

my body’s abilities and its appearance. I still consider 
myself fairly modest, but in a way that reflects my 
own desires and choices instead of those forced upon 
my mind by the perceptions of society. I still seek 

new ways to remain active and challenge myself 
with physical activity. When I learned of the pole 
classes offered near campus, I saw an opportunity 
to continue this journey into confidence, into sen-
suality, going against the limits set by my adolescent 
insecurities.

***

At the end of March, I was finally able to attempt 

this activity I had seen as a pinnacle of all of the men-
tal and physical work I had put into my body: pole 
dancing. I signed up for a Level 1 class at Polarity, 
well-known for its prominent position above South 
University Avenue. Its wide wall of windows allow 
rowdy South U pedestrians to glimpse into the pole-
studded studio, making it an unmistakable store-
front as you walk by. 

Standing close to the windows, I had a constant 

view out onto the bustling scene of South University 
Avenue as I made my movements. After a few exer-
cises, I glanced outside to the street below. Sitting at 
Lan City Noodles, a group of three people were look-
ing up, pointing at those of us twisting around our 
poles. Though the darkness made it feel like we were 
in our own cocoon, we were on full display. Spandex, 
sports bras, gyrations and all. 

From the moment the class began, I was focused

Lookout mom, I’m a pirate now

My mother has been bugging me lately 

about finding an activity to get my blood 
pumping and my endorphins flowing. 
She says it will be “good for my mental 
health” and will “help me sleep better” 
or whatever. She works as a full-time 
nurse and part-time teaching Zumba 
and Group Fight at four different gyms 
— of course she would say that. 

My sister echoes this philosophy. 

She was pulled up to varsity soccer as 
a freshman and works out all the time. 
They both have been on an indoor rock 
climbing kick this month, and the last 
time I visited home, they were so excited 
to flex their new and improved biceps. 
Of course they want me to exercise. 
They do it every day of the week.

But I, on the other hand, am what 

you might call the couch potato of the 
family. The “indoors enthusiast” if you 
want to be a little nicer about it. When 
my family invites me to go climbing 
with them, my typical response is “I 
don’t want to get sweaty today.” 

Here at school, when my friends are 

arm wrestling, I like to volunteer for a 

match purely to demonstrate just how 
swiftly my arm is felled (I lose quite 
immediately). When I attempt one 
single pushup, my body sinks from the 
isosceles triangle position to that of a 
gravity stretch, and no amount of 
effort from my pasty, noodle-
like limbs will push the ground 
away. I can do a pullup, though. 
If I jump. 

It’s not that I don’t 

believe there are 

benefits 

to my being more 
physically 
active, 
it’s 

just that I typically can 
think of a zillion other 
activities 
I 
would 

rather 
engage 

in: a new book, 
practicing 
the 

piano, baking 
a 
beloved 

recipe. 

Running feels good sometimes, I’ll 
admit, but it’s better in theory than it 
is in practice. The energy it takes to 
change into the proper clothes and get 
out the door is greater than the energy 
it takes to not do any of that. 

The annoyances don’t stop at just 

getting ready and leaving the house. 
If I listen 
to 
a 

song 

that’s 

slower than the tempo at 

which my feet are hitting the 
ground, then that’ll be super 

annoying. And I’ll have to take 

a shower after I get all sweaty, I hate 
getting sweaty, and then there’s the 

matter of carrying my phone to play 
music on in the first place. The cost of 

running music is a solid rectangle 

thudding 
against 
your 
leg 

with every step. Have fun 

with side cramps and 

monotony! I’m going 
to go make cookies. 

My 
sophomore 

year of high school, I 

had to look my doctor in the eye and tell 
her that I averaged zero hours of physical 
activity a week, including walking. A 
bit embarrassing, but 100% true. I am 
delighted to report, however, that I am 
writing this with sore leg muscles and 
a small bruise on my right shoulder, 
because your friendly neighborhood 
hermit went sword-fighting. 

My breath heaves in and out, in and 

out as the point is called and the duel 
takes a pause. I had forgotten what it 
was to feel my lungs rapidly expand like 
a parachute and deflate like a balloon. 
My body runs like a decently oiled 
machine, propelling life-giving oxygen 
from the shoulder-width spread of my 
feet to the fingertips holding the hilt 
of my epee. With a twirl of the sword 
and a return to position, I’ve recovered 
enough to spring back in the fray.

For those of you who don’t know, 

there’s a competitive fencing club on 
the University of Michigan’s campus.

Accidentally Wes Anderson, 
On purpose

BY OSCAR NOLLETTE-PATULSKI, 
STATEMENT COLUMNIST 

It’s winter, and it’s cold, so I resolve to make 

some hot chocolate. I’m alone in my house’s nor-
mally bustling kitchen. My socks glide me across 
the floor to the pantry, and I grab cocoa mix and 
slide back to grab a mug. As I open the cabinet, 
a thought strikes me: what if this sock-skating 
scene was a Wes Anderson film? 

I close the cabinet, and when I touch my fin-

gers to open it again, the imaginary camera starts 
rolling. Action! This time, I swing both doors 
open with calculated velocity, and my left and 
right limbs mirror each other precisely. I pause, 
and my hand confidently grabs a mug with some 
French words on it, placing it squarely on the 
counter in a continuous motion. I let the por-
celain plunk resonate in my ears and the room, 
before taking soldier steps to the cylindrical tin of 
cocoa mix.

I let my eyes become the camera — I arch my 

head over the golden container so that its sym-
metrical geometry can be in the foreground 
of the shot. I twist off the lid with gusto, and 
straighten my arm to its fullest extent to set it 
back down. I take out the measuring spoon, and 
mechanically rotate my wrist to scoop, and again 
to spill the powder into the mug. My eyes watch 
the brown powder softly clump at the bottom. I 
repeat this action, and then lift my arm up to be 
perpendicular with my torso to pour milk into 
the cup.

I pick up the mug, place it into the microwave, 

extend a single finger to press the “2” button — a 
detail shot — and then the machine whirs to life. 
I stare at the digital countdown clock intently as 
it descends 1:59 to 1:58 to 1:57, because this might 
mean something important later on. I walk away 
from the microwave and sit down, with my 
elbows forming a right angle between my fore-
arm and the rest of my limb. Cut. Scene!

***

The most recent Wes Anderson movie, “The 

French Dispatch” (2021), profiles a European 
outpost of a fictional midwestern newspaper, the 
Liberty, Kansas Evening Sun, and the various 
articles the reporters write out of their fictional 
French town, Ennui-sur-Blasé. The movie pres-
ents three vignettes, all concerning different top-
ics and magazine sections (art, protest and food) 
that are played out for viewers as its respective 
reporter narrates. 

I watched this movie a few days before my 

dramatic hot cocoa making scene, where I felt 
compelled to mimic the shots and movements of 
the characters I saw in the theater. 

For those unfamiliar, Anderson is a director 

and screenplay writer who is widely recognized 
for his visual and narrative cinematic fingerprint. 
Distinctive aspects of his films include their sat-
isfying color palettes, symmetrical shots (often 
overhead), long panoramas across a scene and 

profile shots in the center of the visual. 

The visual satisfaction this style achieves 

has become popular enough to the point where 
Anderson’s name has become synonymous with 
his style, morphing from a proper noun into a 
descriptive adjective: “This train station is so Wes 
Anderson!”

A few days after my kitchen interpretation of 

the Anderson aesthetic, I drove to Michigan’s 
west side with two friends, making tourist stops 
on the way to my parents’ home. Upon seeing a 
bright white church, its double doors painted a 
fire-engine red, my friend walked up the steps, 
touched the brass handles and pantomimed 
opening them simultaneously. She looked back 
and exclaimed, “It’s like I’m in a Wes Anderson 
film!” The rest of us laughed, looked up at the his-
toric spire and agreed. If we squinted, we were on 
a movie set, playing ourselves, putting on a show 
for the world to see.

It’s this combination of the visually satisfying 

and the publicly popular that allows the Insta-
gram account @accidentallywesanderson to 
flourish. Abbreviated AWA, its profile is full of 
centered foregrounds and symmetrical roofli-
nes, colorful walls and coordinated landscapes,

Mixed strategies at Scorekeepers

BY TAYLOR SCHOTT, STATEMENT DEPUTY EDITOR

However lame it makes me to say so, I don’t like 

going out. It is, to put it simply, a lot of work. It’s physi-
cal work — the walking to, the dancing at. Constant-
ly adjusting my bad posture. It’s mental work — the 
middling conversation, if it could be called conversa-
tion, the scheming involved in getting a drink, or cut-
ting the bathroom line. 

Needless to say, ‘going out’ is not a game I’m good 

at playing. The dusty, blue-vinyl book I checked out 
from the library titled “Studies in Game Theory” 
suggests that the type of game played at a place 
like Scorekeepers — affectionately referred to as 
“Skeeps”— can be “non-cooperative” (a competitive 
social interaction, each player aiming toward their 
own goals) or “cooperative” (non-competitive, with 
unknown payoffs).

But if Skeeps is indeed a game, who are the play-

ers, their ranks? What defines a win, and what 
defines a loss? 

I don’t have social anxiety, I always begin with 

as some sort of disclaimer — my mental and physi-
cal faculties, though strained by socialization, typi-
cally remain intact. But I am easily worn down by 
long stretches of talking, navigating large groups 
and maintaining an approachable attitude. I have to 
force my mouth out of its slack, draw back my shoul-
ders and, well, act. 

Breaking my introverted habits by going out to 

Skeeps, then, required some planning — not just the 
outfit I should wear, but the personality, too. What 
kind of things should I say? What kind of tenden-
cies should I adopt? How high should my eyebrows 
arch, how wide should my smile stretch? There was 
a long list of choices for the kind of player I could be, 
each with their own taxing responsibilities. I had no 
idea what the payoff of playing would be, though I 
imagined it would resemble something like enjoying 
myself. 

The night arrived. Briefing a trusted band of close 

friends with my plan to adopt extroversion for the 
night, I downed a shot and fumbled to lace my shoes. 
It’s so much easier when I drink, I whisper to my 
roommate, to say whatever’s on my mind. She eyes 
me and laughs. Our other friend across the room 
laughs too, her vocal chords animating her silver 
pendant inscribed with the word fuckoff.

We arrive downtown at the fashionable hour 

of 11, taking our place in line. As we wait, I cannot 
stop thinking about the French word for stranger — 
l’étranger, phonetically lay-tchron-jay — that stifled 
gargle so specific to its pronunciation. I play with the 
word’s letters on my lips and in the back of my throat. 
How else am I supposed to entertain myself? I stand, 
fiddling with my rings, asking my friends in random 
intervals how much longer they think we’ll have to 
wait under the oppressive, but welcome, overhead 
heating system. Rain fell. 

Once admitted inside, I marvel at the vaulted 

ceilings as my wrist is pulled towards the coat check 
table. I shed my jacket, revealing my bare shoulders 
and a borrowed top. There is no “right way” to be a 
woman, but it is in these sorts of spaces that I begin 
to feel as if my shapeless sweater, albeit low-cut, isn’t 
exactly following dress code. Leather pants swish 
past me. Tight, animal-print tops populate the dance 
floor. I eye them all with hardly any subtlety, each 
returned look an appraisal of my own appearance. 

Refreshing ourselves at a countertop, the bar-

tender smiles at my roommate. Was that attraction 
or charity? I smile at my roommate. “Remember 
your notes!” She turns to remark, her long hair skim-
ming the top of her drink. 

Draining another cup of rum and coke, I find 

myself declaring loudly, with a few misplaced verbs, 
about how the word fish is an overgeneralization 
— we say many animals are fish when they are in 
fact not fish: jellyfish, crayfish, starfish, cuttlefish, 
despite their names, are not fish. Which me is saying 

this completely unessential fact? My mortgaged per-
sonality is worn out already. In the refuge of a text 
conversation, I slink toward the nearest wall. My 
phone buzzes again: “No wallflowering,” my room-
mate nags, lovingly. 

Might my introversion be a genetic facet of 

myself that, no matter how much I pretend, I cannot 
reverse? Research into temperament and person-
ality as innate traits suggests that I could be right. 
Jerome Kagan, one of the great developmental 
psychologists of the 21st century, conducted a lon-
gitudinal study in which he exposed 4-month-olds 
to an array of new stimuli: balloons popping, colorful 
mobiles, foreign scents on cotton swabs. The babies, 
based on their reactions, were then divided into two 
groups: high-reactive and low-reactive. Kagan held 
that the high-reactive group would grow up to be 
classically introverted, and the low-reactive group 
classically extroverted. Kagan was determined to 
follow these children well into development, testing 
his theory on temperament as an innate reaction to 
stimuli.

In the throes of their adolescence, the no-longer-

babies were brought in for interviews. Did they pre-
fer a few close friends or a large band of them? Were 
they eager to introduce themselves to people they 
didn’t know or would they wait for an introduction 
to happen? Amazingly, Kagan had predicted the 
temperaments they would develop with incredible 
accuracy: the low-reactive babies who displayed 
little concern with the new stimuli were more likely 
to become calm, assured extroverts, while the high-
reactive babies who cried and pumped their tiny 
limbs at the stimuli were more likely to become 
reserved, cerebral introverts.
