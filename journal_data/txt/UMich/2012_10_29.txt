ELECTION 2012
Democrats
set sights on
recapturing
state House

Ouimet targeted
as Dems support
Saline Mayor
0 Driskell
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
Though State Rep. Jeff Irwin
(D-Ann Arbor) claims he is
friendly with his colleague State
Rep. Mark Ouimet (R-Scio
Township), Irwin spent much
of the summer campaigning for
Ouimet's opponent in the 52nd
district election, Saline Mayor
Gretchen Driskell.
To Irwin, the Republican
incumbent has given up his
moderate values to side with
the ranking Republicans in the
state legislature and Republican
Gov. Rick Snyder on issues like
education cuts.
At a rally co-hosted by
Driskell and the University's
chapter of the College Demo-
crats Sunday night at Circus
Club in Ann Arbor, Irwin
emphasized the opportunityfor
Democrats to re-claim the state
House of Representatives as his
reason for endorsing Driskell.

State Democrats need 10 seats
to gaina majority in the legisla-
tive chamber, and the party has
been pressing the importance
of winning elections across
the state, such as the contest
between Ouimet and Driskell,
in an effort to reclaim control.
At the event
- which fea-
tured U.S. Rep. 2
John Dingell * U~
(D-Mich.), his l
wife Debbie
Dingell and
State Sen. Rebekah Warren (D-
Ann Arbor) - discussion of the
House races overshadowed the
presidential election, even as
poiis show a narrowing presi-
dential race in the state.
"This is ground zero," Debbie
Dingell told the crowd of about
100 people. "We have so much
at stake."
According to the Democratic
officials at the rally, the future
of state politics is at the fore-
front of the state House races.
. "You're here because you
already know that the future of
this state hangs in the balance
right now," Warren said. "This
is a big election."

Sudents brace for Sandy

Massive storm
heads toward the
East Coast
By ADAM RUBENFIRE

Daily News Editor and

Hurricane Sandy is expect-
ed to wreak havoc on the East
Coast this week with sheets

of rain, high winds and heavy
snow slated to impact one third
of the country, including Uni-
versity students partaking in
programs in coastal areas.
Officials have warned mil-
lions of residents living in com-
munities in the storm's path to
evacuate, and various business-
es and public transit systems
have been closed, including
some subway routes in New
York City. Several universities
have also closed their campus-

es due to the storm, including
Georgetown University, Boston
University, New York University
and Princeton University, while
many others have canceled
Monday classes.

In new 12th district, Kallgren the

It's expensive to operate 157

Republican a long
shot to unseat
Dean of the House
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
Trenton resident Cynthia
Kallgren spends a lot of time
knocking on doors, climbing
porches and ringing doorbells
- she is a congressional candi-

date on a mission.
Though she doesn't have
the seasoned . experience of
her opponent, U.S. Rep. John
Dingell (D-Mich.), the Repub-
lican candidate hopes her back-
ground as a "Downriver girl"
and small-business owner will
resonate with voters on Elec-
tion Day as she seeks to repre-
'sent Michigan's newly drawn
12th Congressional District.
However, for many voters in
the district - which stretches

from Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti,
south to Monroe County, and
east to the downriver commu-
nities of Dearborn, Trenton
and Southgate - Kallgren is
not a familiar name.
Winning the race of name
recognition is a tough feat in
the face of a "dynasty," Kall-
gren said, as Dingell has held
office since 1955, after replac-
ing his father who had served
since 1932.

BUILDING THE BEAT

George Washington Uni-
versity has asked a Districc of
Columbia courc to throw out a
$1.3 million lawsuit in which a
janitorial employee alleges she
was harassed and discriminated
against by a GW Police officer
due to her race and gender, the
GW Hatchet reported Thursday.
Rebecca Ashitey, a native of
Ghana, alleges that an officer-
named J. Cates in the suit - has
repeatedly stopped her at the
entrance to her place of work,
such as her name, social secu-
rity number and GW identifica-
tion number. She also alleges
that, in October 2011, the officer
assaulted and arrested her when
she bypassed his questioning to

enter a building.
GW lawyers claim Ashitey
has not followed the proper pro-
tocol for filinig a lawsuit.
MTV CONNECTS
GEORGETOWN TO OBAMA
Students at Georgetown Uni-

"Power of 12" campaign this
week, which focuses on promot-
ing the election through giving
students the opportunity to ask
candidates question, accord-
ing to an a .Friday article in the
Hoya.
Georgetown students were
e-mailed a week in advance
and encouraged to submit their

questions for consideration for
the show, which was hosted on
Georgetown's campus by MTV
news correspondent Andrew
Jenks.
"I was impressed at how
articulate everyone was," Jenks
said in the article. "They knew
the issues and were very specif-
ic in what they wanted to hear
from the President."
MTV-also hopes to conduct a
similar interview session with

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Dozens attend
Detroit vigil amid
crime worries
Dozens of people concerned
about possible recent attacks on
women turned out for a candle-
light vigil at a southwest Detroit
park despite assurances from
police that their worries are
unfounded.
 The Detroit News reports the
vigil took place Thursday night at
Patton Park.
Area resident Becky Dorie says
they're "hoping to get our streets
back." She says she's joined in
almost nightly patrols of the area
with a community group.
Southwest District police
Commander John Serta says he's
been "trying to put down" recent
rumors of multiple attacks on
women.
IOWA CITY
1977 killing: Were
suspects framed?
 Two black men wrongly con-
victed in the 1977 murder of a
white Iowa police officer hope to
prove something they couldn't
during trials that sent them to
prison for 25 years: that detectives
framed them to solve a high-pro-
file case.
During a civil trial that starts
Wednesday in Des Moines, Terry
Harrington and Curtis McGhee
will argue that Council Bluffs
police officers coerced witness-
es into fabricating testimony
against them in the killing of John
Schweer.
Schweer was found dead while
working as the night watchman
at a car dealership. Harrington
and McGhee, then teenagers from
neighboring Omaha, Neb., say
detectives used threats against a
group of young black car theft sus-
pects to trump up evidence target-
ing them because of their race and
pressure to solve the retired cap-_
tain's killing.
RAMALLAH, West Bank
Palestinians look
for UN recognition
next month
The Palestinian president is
moving forward with his plan to
seek upgraded observer status at
the United Nations next month,
despite American and Israeli
threats of financial or diplomatic
retaliation, officials said Sunday.
The decision sets the stage for
a new showdown between Israel
and the Palestinians at the world
body, followinglast year's attempt
by the Palestinians to seek status
as a full member state. Although
that initiative failed to pass the
U.N. Security Council, it caused
months of diplomatic tensions
with Israel.
"We will go to the U.N. regard-
less of any threats," said Taw-
fik Tirawi, a senior member of
President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah

movement. "I expect the Israelis
to take punitive measures against
us, if we win this status, but this is
our choice and we will not retract
it."
BAGHDAD
Iraq searches plane
bound for Syria
Iraqi authorities forced an
Iranian cargo plane heading to
Syria to land for inspection in
Baghdad to ensure it was not car-
rying weapons, an Iraqi official
said Sunday.
It was the second such forced
landing this month. The plane
was released after the check.
The move appeared aimed at
easing U.S. concerns that Iraq
has become a route for shipments
of Iranian military supplies that
might could Syrian President
Bashar Assad battle rebels in his
country's civil war.
The head of the Iraqi Civil
Aviation Authority, Nassir Ban-
 dar, said the inspection took
place Saturday. The inspectors
allowed the plane to continue
its flight after they determined
there were no weapons onboard,
he said.

Evacuations but no
major damage in
B.C.
VANCOUVER, British
Columbia (AP) - A magnitude
7.7 earthquake struck off the
west coast of Canada, but there
were no reports of major dam-
age. Residents in parts of British
Columbia were evacuated, but
the province appeared to escape
the biggest quake in Canada
since 1949 largely unscathed.
The U.S. Geological Survey
said the powerful temblor hit
the Queen Charlotte Islands just
after 8 p.m. local time Saturday
at a depth of about 3 miles (5
kilometers) and was centered 96
miles (155 kilometers) south of
Masset, British Columbia. It was
felt across a wide area in Brit-
ish Columbia, both on its Pacific
islands and on the mainland.
"It looks like the damage
and the risk are at a very low
level," said Shirley Bond, British
Columbia's minister responsible
for emergency management said.
"We're certainly grateful."
The Pacific Tsunami Warning
Center lifted its tsunami advi-
sory for Hawaii Sunday morn-
ing just before 4 a.m. local time,
three hours after downgrading
from a warning and less than six
hours after the waves first hit the
islands.
Meanwhile, the National
Weather Service canceled tsu-
nami advisories for Canada,
Alaska, Washington, Oregon and
California.
Tsunami Warning Center
officials said wave heights were
diminishing in Hawaii, though
swimmers and boaters should
be careful of strong or unusual

currents. The biggest waves -
about 5 feet (1.5 meters)high -
appeared to hit Maui.
There were no immediate
reports of damage, though one
person died in a fatal crash near
a road that was closed because
of the threat near Oahu's north
shore.
Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrom-
bie said the state was lucky to
avoid more severe surges.
"We're very, very gratefulthat
we can go home tonight count-
ing our blessings," Abercrombie
said.
Dennis Sinnott of the Cana-
dian Institute of Ocean Science
said a 69-centimeter (27 inch)
wave was recorded off Langara
Island on the northeast tip of
Haida Gwaii, formerly called the
Queen Charlotte Islands. The
islands are home to about 5,000
people, many of them members
of the Haida aboriginal group.
Another 55 centimeter (21 inch)
wave hit Winter Harbour on the
northeast coast of Vancouver
Island.
Canada's largest earthquake
since 1700 was an 8.1 magni-
tude quake on August 22, 1949
off the coast of British Colum-
bia, according to the Canadian
government's Natural Resourc-
es website. It occurred on the
Queen Charlotte Fault in what
the department called Canada's
equivalent of the San Andreas
Fault - the boundary between
the Pacific and North Ameri-
can plates that runs underwater
along the west coast of the Haida
Gwaii.
In 1970 a 7.4 magnitude quake
struck south of the Haida Gwaii.
The USGS said the temblor
shook the waters around British
Columbia and was followed by a
5.8 magnitude aftershock after

Giants beat Tigers,
4-3, in 10 innings to
win championship
DETROIT (AP) - Smart
pitching. Clutch hitting. Sharp
fielding. Plus an MVP Panda.
All the right elements for a
sweet World Series sweep for the
San Francisco Giants.
Nearly knocked out in the
playoffstime andtime again, and
finally pressed by the Detroit
Tigers in Game 4, Pablo Sando-
val and the Giants clinched their
second title in three seasons
Sunday night.
Marco Scutaro - who else? -
delivered one more key hit this
October, a go-ahead single with
two outs in the 10th inning that
lifted the Giants to a 4-3 win.
"Detroit probably didn't know
what it was in for," Giants gen-
eral manager Brian Sabean said.
"Our guys had a date with des-
tiny."
On a night of biting cold, stiff
breezes andsomerain,theGiants
combined the most important
elements of championship base-
ball. After three straight wins
that looked relatively easy, they
sealed this victory when Sergio
Romo got Triple Crown winner
Miguel Cabrera to look at strike
three for the final out.
"Tonight was a battle," Giants
star Buster Posey said. "And I
think tonight was a fitting way
for us to end it because those
guys played hard. They didn't

stop, and it's an unbelievable
feeling."
Posey, the only player who
was in the starting lineup when
San Francisco beat Texas in the
2010 clincher, and the underdog
Giants celebrated in the center of
the diamond at Comerica Park.
They built toward this party
all month, winning six elimina-
tion games this postseason. In
the clubhouse, they hoisted the
trophy, passed it around and
shouted the name of each player
who held it.
"World Series champions,"
Giants outfielder Hunter Pence
hollered.
Benched during the 2010
Series, Sandoval, nicknamed
Kung Fu Panda, went 8 for 16,
including a three-homer perfor-
mance in Game 1.
"You learn," Sandoval said.
"You learn from everything
that happened in your career....
We're working hard to enjoy this
moment right now."
Cabrera delivered the first
big hit for Detroit, interrupting
San Francisco's run of dominant
pitching with a two-run homer
that blew over the right-field
wall in the third.
Posey put the Giants ahead
3-2 with a two-run homer in
the sixth and Delmon Young hit
a tying home run in the bottom
half.
It then became a matchup of
bullpens, and the Giants pre-
vailed.
Ryan Theriot led off the 10th
with a single against Phil Coke,

moved up on Brandon Craw-
ford's sacrifice and scored on a
shallow single by Scutaro, the
MVP of the NL championship
series. Center fielder Austin
Jackson made a throw home, to
no avail.
"That's what makes it so
much special, the way we did
it," Scutaro said. "We're always
against the wall and my team,
it just came through first series,
second series and now we sweep
the Tigers."
Romo struck out the side in
the bottom of the 10th for his
third save of the Series.
The Giants finished the month
with seven straight wins and
their seventh Series champion-
ship. They handed the Tigers
their seventh straight World
Series loss dating to 2006.
"Obviously, there was no
doubt about it. They swept us,"
Tigers manager Jim Leyland
said. "So there was certainly no
bad breaks, no fluke.
"Simple, they did better than
we did," he said. "It was freaky.
I would have never guessed we
would have swept the Yankees
and I would have never guessed
the Giants would have swept us."
The Giants combined for a
1.42 ERA, outscored the Tigers
16-6 and held them to a .159 bat-
ting average.
"I think we never found
our confidence at home plate,"
Cabrera said. "It was not the
same game we played. We could
not find our game in the World
Series."

years appealing
Court decisions
SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) -
Torrential overnight rains had
washed away the blood so the
searchers at first thought the
pale form lying on the earthen
berm might be a mannequin.
"I almost didn't believe it,"
recalled former Lincoln Coun-
ty Sheriff Ken Albers, the first
officer to approach the body of
9-year-old Becky O'Connell.
"You don't mess up a crime
scene, but I had to walk over
and touch the body to convince
myself that it was real."
The shocking discovery that
night in 1990 began a 22-year
legal and emotional saga that is
expected to end Tuesday, when
Donald Moeller, who was con-
victed of abducting and murder-
ing the girl, is scheduled to be
put to death by lethal injection
in the state penitentiary.
After decades of appeals,
Moeller, 60, now accepts his
fate without protest. But the
end leaves behind a community
still marked by the crime and its
experience with capital punish-
ment.
Moeller's death sentence
in 1992 was the first handed
down in South Dakota in 45
years. Until this month, when
the killer of a prison guard was
executed, there had been only
one other execution in the state

since the 1940s.
The child's mother, Tina Curl,
plans to drive the 1,400 miles
back to Sioux Falls from her
native New York state to watch
Moeller take his last breath. She
didn't have the money for the
trip but did fundraising events
to pay her way.
"I'm looking forward to it,"
said Curl, who said she fell into
alcoholism after her daughter's
death. "All this is just bringing
what I tried to push way in the
back, back up front."
Some residents said the mur-
der changed how they felt about
their city, where violent crime is
rare.
"It's just like society as a
whole just kind of tightened up
for a long time," said Jeff Mas-
ten, the former Lincoln County
state's attorney who prosecuted
the case, and who later changed
careers because of the strain of
criminal law.
LaVonne Martley, a juror,
said she knew the execution
would bring the case back into
the public spotlight - "and I've
dreaded it." But she has never
questioned the outcome. "He
definitely did it," she said.
Curl thought she was escap-
ing the dangers of big-city life
when she moved her family in
1990 from New York to Sioux
Falls, a well-kept, medium-size
city along the Big Sioux River
that serves as a market center
for the sprawling expanse of
farmland where South Dako-
ta, Iowa and Minnesota come

together. Homicides happen,
but not many - about a half
dozen a year, most involving
people who know each other,
and where there is no mystery
to solve.
On May 8, 1990, Becky, a
fourth-grader who lived with
her mother and stepfather in a
Sioux Falls mobile home, began
walking a couple of blocks to
Omer's Market to buy sugar
to make lemonade. She never
returned.
Authorities say Moeller, a
felon with a history of assaults
who lived nearby, lured the
brown-haired girl into his truck
and drove her to a wooded area
near the Iowa state line, where
he raped her, stabbed her and
left her to bleed to death.
Moeller was interviewed
shortly after the killing but
disappeared before investiga-
tors could follow up. Detec-
tives later tracked him down
in Tacoma, Wash., and brought
him back for trial. He was con-
victed in September 1992 based
on DNA and circumstantial evi-
dence. The trial, with detailed
and graphic displays on how
the child was killed, devastated
the community, but the ordeal
wasn't over: The verdict was
overturned by the South Dakota
Supreme Court because of the
mention of past crimes during
testimony.
With a new trial ordered in
1996, the horror of the grue-
some killing was relived, and
lingered for years longer.

Ballot proposals often present a false image: On the surface,
proposals appear to be the product of a grassroots effort to
amend a state's constitution or change a state law to better
serve its residents. Yet that idealistic image is not reality. Special
interest groups usually finance the campaigns for ballot proposals,
using much of their funds to monopolize the debate. In 2012, Michi-
gan voters face six statewide ballot proposals. Some may genuinely
create positive change, while others are deceptive in nature and are
potentially dangerous.

Proposal 1 asks voters to decide on the fate
of Public Act 4, which establishes criteria to
assess the financial situation of local gov-
ernments and authorize a state-appointed
review team to enter into local government.
It also allows the governor to appoint an
emergency manager if the review concludes
financial emergency. The emergency man-
ager is required to develop financial plans for
the city and overrule elected officials.
Michigan's emergency financial manager
law gives too much power to non-elected offi-
cials, seriously undermining the democratic
process. While policymakers can be ineffec-
tive, relinquishing power to someone who may
align incorrectly with the community's wishes
isn't the answer. In order to protect the demo-
cratic process, vote NO on Proposal Ito repeal
Public Act 4.
Proposal 2 reaffirms the rights of public and
private employees to join unions and bargain
collectively. It also overrides state laws that
regulate hours and conditions of employment
if those laws conflict with collective bargaining
agreements. Proposal 2 would thus give perma-
nent bargaining rights to all employees.
Collective bargaining is an essential right for
all workers. Proposal 2 will help keep employees
safe and provides a necessary - and often times
undervalued - voice for all workers. Unions,
for their flaws, have been essential in creating a
middle class and improving American working
conditions. This proposal ensures all deserving
workers have basic rights. To protect collective
bargaining, vote YES on Proposal2.
Proposal 3 stipulates an amendment to the
state's constitution that would require that by
the year 2025, at least 25 percent of Michigan's
energy come from specified renewable energy
sources. Acceptable energy sources are wind,
solar, biomass and hydropower. Anticipat-
ing increases in utility rates for the public, the
amendment includes a provision that doesn't
allow electric utility rates to increase by more
than 1 percent per year while achieying to 10
percent increase in alternative energy require-
ments. It also requires legislators to encourage
Michigan workers and production units when
striving for the 25 percent standard.
Clean energy is extremely important to the
future of Michigan. Renewable energy sources
can be vital to Michigan's economy and envi-
ronmental leadership. However, putting in
place a constitutional amendment that stipu-
lates an arbitrary percentage may slow down
innovation and actually restrict development
of efficient clean energy alternatives. Limiting
the types of energy to wind, solar, biomass and
hydropower puts the government in the posi-
tion of picking winners and losers, which by
2025 may be irrelevant. If these aren't the most
effective or efficient ways to produce alterna-
tive energy, this amendment would actually

push Michigan backward in the race for the
benefits of green, high-tech industry. It's essen-
tial to move toward a future of sustainability
and alternative energy sources, but Michigan
must do so in a way that is flexible and allows
for organic innovation. Because this proposal is
limiting and arbitrary, vote NO on Proposal3.
Proposal 4 deals with the rights of in-home
healthcare workers. Under the proposed
amendment, limited collective bargaining
rights would be given to more than 42,000
Michigan residents working in the homes of
Medicare-eligible senior citizens and the dis-
abled. Bargainingwouldbe carried outthrough
the Michigan Quality Home Care Council, a
board that will also provide training to these
workers and create a registry of workers who
pass background checks. The amendment pro-
vides in-home care workers with collective bar-
gaining rights, while the creation of MQHCC
ensures quality health care and increased
transparency for patients. To protect the rights
of health care employees and their patients,
vote YES on Proposal 4.
Proposal 5 would either require a two-
thirds super-majority in the state Legisla-
ture or a statewide ballot referendum to raise
taxes. Proposal 5, at first glance, appears
to give the power back to voters and keep
it out of the hands of Michigan's lately mis-
guided Legislature. However, essential taxes,
like those for education and transportation
improvements, would become extremely hard
to pass in the conservative atmosphere of the
country. Taxes aren't inherently bad - mak-
ing them even harder to pass is paranoia, not
policy. To protect our basic services and stop
our legislature from becoming even more
inefficient, vote NO on Proposal .
Proposal 6i would require a majority vote
in a statewide ballot on the construction of
new international crossings. The current
bridge from Detroit to Canada, owned pri-
vately by Manuel "Matty" Maroun's com-
pany, isn't sufficient. The Ambassador Bridge
makes his company a fortune eventhough it's
an inefficient crossing between the United
States and Canada. The Canadian govern-
ment has repeatedly offered $550 million to
cover Michigan's costs associated with the
bridge, although estimates vary as to how
much the bridge will cost. Allocating funds
for infrastructure improvements is within
the state and local government's jurisdic-
tion. Proposal 6's campaign has been heavily
funded by Maroun's greed. There is no need
to slow down the process of improving the
state's infrastructure by mandating that indi-
viduals vote on every additional international
crossing proposal. To improve transportation
in Michigan and stop self-serving interests
from amending the state constitution, vote
NO on Proposal 6.

always the first
to succumb to peer pressure. One
day when climbing the monkey bars,
someone dared him to do a back flip
off of the bars onto the ground. Alex
made the leap and proceeded to
crack his head open on the ground.
After a few stitches Alex was okay,
but the kids that walked away from
the playground that day learned a
valuable lesson.
More than a decade later, I find
myself confronted with a modern-
day Alex figure. Although I don't
know him personally, I can spot
similar personality traits from a mile
away. This figure is Republican presi-
dential nominee Mitt Romney.
Sure, Romney's definition of "cool"
is a little different than Alex's. Nev-
ertheless, whether eating a worm to
prove that you're one of the cool kids
or renouncing your previous position
on a woman's rightto choose to prove
your conservatism, in the end, you're
just someone desperate for approval.
Be it the auto industry, health-
care or Iraq, it seems like Romney
has changed his stance on just about
all of his views during the course of
his long candidacy for president.
The man has even changed his
stance on Reagan, a crime punish-
able by Tea Partier death. When
running for Massachusetts Sen-
ate in 1994, Romney once bragged

that he "was an independent dur-
ing the time of Reagan-Bush" and
that he was "not tryingto return to
Reagan-Bush" anytime soon. Now,
Romney proudly proclaims his
undying love for the conservative
demigod and his desire to return to
those "Reagan Principles."
Although the Reagan example is
somewhat comical, some of Rom-
ney's other "political evolutions" are
nothing to joke about. What is most
bizarre about Romney's unprec-
edented sliminess is that he hasn't
just done it once or eventwice, he has
completely altered some of his views
an astonishingthree times.
The GOP primary favors extreme
conservatism, especially during this
cycle. Rarely do we see a Republican
candidate come out with all of his or
her core beliefs intact.
Romney was no exception to that.
Pundits understood that Romney
would have to convince the conser-
vative base that he was "Reagan"
enough for the "Grand Ol' Party,"
but few foresaw the transition that
unfolded throughout the last year
and a half.
After all, how can the same man
who once said, "I believe that abor-
tion should be safe and legal in this
country," later say he would be
delighted to sign a bill that banned
abortion and would support the Per-
sonhood Amendment.
Now, this would be enough of a flip
flop on its own, but Romney somehow
managed to change his stance again
once the general election began, stat-
ing that he supports abortion in the
cases of rape, incest or the threat of
the mother's life. He has even run
ads bragging to independent female
voters that he is "not as against abor-
tion," as the left makes him out to be.
While some view these changes as
massive stance shifts, I believe that
term does not nearly do these maneu-
vers justice. These complete 360s are


a sign of a man with little regard for
what his personal stances truly are
- someone who's willing to sacrifice
his integrity to win. These types of
people are among the most danger-
ous people in the world because they
allow themselves to be changed by
those around them.
Romney has flip
flopped through
the campaign.

was the yel- BURROUGHS
low Livestrong
bracelet that
started the trend.
Tens of millions bracelets have
been sold sincetheir release in 2005.
The sales have contributed to the
$470 million raised in the organi-
zation's 15-year history. Armstrong
himself, the longtime chairman of
the foundation, has recently stepped
down after additional charges of
performance enhancing drug use
were brought against him.
The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency
issued a report detailing Arm-
strong's extensive use and distri-
bution of performance enhancing
drugs, or PEDs. The International
Cycling Union (UCI) subsequently
stripped Armstrong of his seven
Tour De France victories. The
Union also issued him a lifelong ban
on cycling.
In the USADA report, a group of
former teammates testified he bul-
lied and threatened them to remain
silent. Though Armstrong has yet
to admit to these accusations, the
findings that the USADA released
in a 1,000-page document seem
to confirm rumors of Armstrong's
PEDs use.
These recent developments have
shattered the iconic image of Arm-
strong that my generation grew
up with. He has been a symbol for
those fighting cancer and an inspi-

ration to thousands, but now he has
been exposed as a cheater and bully.
This fall from grace raises numer-
ous questions about Armstrong's
legacy. His name has been erased
from the record books, but how
will those who idolized this man
remember his story?
Cycling, wildly perceived as one
of the "dirtiest" sports, has con-
stantly been under fire for lax test-
ing policies and minimal control
over athletes. According to CBS
news, out of the top 10 finishers in
the seven Tour de Frances that Arm-
strong won, 41 have been accused
of or have admitted to PEDs use.
This context is certainly relevant
and important as we decide how to
remember Armstrong.
UCI president Pat McQuaid
urged the public to "forget" Arm-
strong and that he was "sickened"
by Armstrong's actions. Perhaps I
have just been callused by growing
up through baseball's steroid era,
but Armstrong's use of PEDs is not
the damningevidence that McQuaid
sees it as.
In a sport that's plagued with
PEDs and a career that attracted
much suspicion of PED use, it's
hardly surprising that Armstrong
was anavid user. Whathas impacted
myimage ofArmstrong the most are
the accusations and testimonies out-
lining how Armstrong bullied and
threatened teammates, drug testers
and cycling officials. Athletes are
supposed to be willing to sacrifice
anything for their teammates. This
shows a completely different side
to Armstrong's character and has
tainted his reputation. Regardless of
your opinions on his PED usage, this
will and should change the public's
view on Armstrong's character.
However in the case of Arm-
strong, this bad cannot erase all the
good he has done. As someone who
has had numerous family members

We have already seen the horrors
of a president who was controlled
by diabolical thinkers (Cheney,
Rove and Rumsfeld). The last time
we elected a president who was
unwilling to say no to the radicals
around him, we became involved in
two wars, opened Guantanamo and
began fully institutionalizing torture
as a national security strategy. The
last thing America needs is a presi-
dent who doesn't know how to say no.
Romney could very well be our
next president. I hope people are
as worried as I am about which
Romney we will be getting, and if
he will entirely allow himself to
be controlled by ultraconservative
interests.
I haven't spoken to Alex in nearly
a decade. I hope he has learned that
desperately seeking acceptance is
no way to live one's life. Perhaps he
also learned something that day on
the playground. Unfortunately, I
fear that if Romney wins, he'll sell
himself out and attempts to do a
back flip as president, it will take a
whole lot more than a few stitches
to repair America.

ion
diagnosed with cancer and fought
it, Armstrong will always be a hero
to me. Obviously, he was more of a
symbol and spokesman than a major
organizer, but his inspiration and
effort has contributed to the $470
million raised. Just like remember-
ing other tarnished athletes, such
as Pete Rose or Marian Jones, you
have to judge the entire person. Now
that Nike and Oakley have cancelled
sponsorship deals and Armstrong
has been stripped of his titles, it's
easy to make knee-jerk judgments.
I urge anyone who grew up wearing
those wristbands to seriously con- 4
sider the entire man when deciding
on his legacy.
Armstrong may
be erased from
record books, but
not our memory.
Though Armstrong has clearly
wronged many people and deserves
consequences, the money he has
raised and the hope he inspired is
enough for him to be remembered
favorably. The UCI's decision to cut
ties and erase the story of Lance
Armstrong is ridiculous. Stripping
Armstrong of his titles perhaps is
justified, but his use of PEDs speaks
more to the corrupt nature of the
sport and less with the quality of
Armstrong's character. Armstrong ,
should be remembered as all that he
was and is: a liar, a cheat, and a com-
petitor, yes, but most importantly a
philanthropist and an inspiration
to millions.

LBGTQ equality
TO THE DAILY:
LGBTQ rights have been disputed since
the early 1800s, and as of late become a major
debate in the United States. However, the U.S.
has already determined part of the argument:
It supports some same-sex issue - Michigan,
however, does not. In the decision of Lawrence
v. Texas, the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated
all laws that had gone against consensual
"sodomy" throughout America. This decision
made same-sex activity legal in every state
and territory. So why not allow them the same
rights to marriage as a heterosexual couple?
Upon the decision of the Lawrence v.

LGBTQ conduct is protected by the Four-
teenth Amendment. However, Michigan still
ignores this fact and that its residents want
a change. In the Public Policy Polling survey
of May 2012, 70 percent of voters supported
legal recognition of these couples, and it also
showed an increase in people who support
LGBTQ rights.
The U.S. has already acknowledged the
rights of numerous groups through civil right
movements. It's only a matter of time before
LGBTQ rights are finally attended to, and
eventually become legal. So why not allow
LGBTQ people their rights now, why prolong
it? We, as a diverse community, can make that
change, one vote at a time.

It's also, however, a textbook

The problem is, for every scene
of true feeling, there is another

Fear of emptiness, and fear in

to open a letter from his absent

and of what the words inside

forward with his dreams while
he sits flipping pizzas. These are
compelling, complex feelings, but

A ship's crew has been struck

the captain and the first mate
remain alive. The first mate
suspects the illness is somehow
related to a coffin being trans-
ported below deck. Just before
sunset, he heads below with
a hatchet and splits the cof-
fin open. Suddenly, to his hor-
ror, the human-esque figure he
thought was dead rises from the
coffin. Cue laughter.

The film is an unauthorized

But "Atlas" struggles to find a
notable connection between its
stories and characters, supposed-
ly reincarnations of the same soul
in different bodies over time. The
point of this reincarnation is lost
in the overall context, and the

directors are unable to tie loose
ends together. Though it seems
as if a missing piece of the puzzle
might become more evident upon
a second viewing of the film, it
won't, because it's not there.
Regardless of that gaping hole,
there's more than enough in
"Atlas" to enjoy, as it finds at least
one common message about the
persistence of the human spirit
through time - both in the mis-
takes we make as a species and
how we overcome them.

and Sturgess inoparticular play six
different reincarnations of their
respective characters, ranging
from cannibalistic tribal leaders
to futuristic army commanders.
They pull off that endeavor suc-

heroes of "Atlas" are in fact its
make-up artists, who deserve so
much more than a standing ova-
tion come awards season.
"Cloud Atlas" is ambitious and
thoughtful. It expertly meshes
sci-fi, drama, comedy and histor-
ic fantasy into something strange
and enjoyable. And despite its
lapses in lucidity, "Atlas" wins
simply because its unlike any-

scenes that alreadypossessit. The
act of riding a wave should be a
smooth endeavor, and we expect
the direction to emulate the con-
tent - instead it feels like a Red
Bull commercial.
"Mavericks" supplies music
where the roaring of the sea
would suffice, another folly. The
ocean is the soundtrack of a surf-
er, and "Mavericks" should have
recognized that every Power-
Rock anthem it plays separates
the audience from an organic
understanding of the sport.
"Chasing Mavericks" is over-
loaded, leaking from the sides
with unnecessary and underde-
veloped plots, characters and aes-
thetics. The ocean is harsh and
soft; something worth contem-
plating. While "Mavericks" wants
to do good, its commercial pack-
aging ultimately undermines its
spiritual content. Surfing has soul,
but it's hard to find in this film.

emphasized how establishing
Democratic leadership of the state
House could establish easy access
to the state's public universities,
provide equal rights for women
andmembers of LGBT community
and enact economic fairness.
"Part of the problem right now
is that there's no balance; the
governor and the House and the
Senate - they're all Republican,
so there's no dialogue, there's no
public process, things go really
quickly," Driskell said in an inter-
view after the event. "If we had
the House back in Democratic
hands, we would actually be able
to make some momentum on that,
and (the state government would)
be more moderate."
Both the Michigan Republican
Party and statewide Democratic
Party have targeted the 52nd dis-
trict election as a critical battle.

man for the Michigan Republican
Party, told The Michigan Daily

While the University keeps tabs

Fitzgerald noted that domestic
"travel is more difficult to track.
However, he said the media
frenzy that has surrounded the
arrival of the hurricane should
be effective in keeping traveling
students and faculty informed
of the dangers of the inclement
weather.
"The good thing in this situa-
tion is that this storm has been
getting lots of media attention,
so any groups traveling to the
East Coast certainly are aware
of the storm and able to make
informed decisions about their

Between 60 percent and 80

natural area preservation, park
security and recreation facility

will retain their majority in the
state House.
"When you compare what the
Republican leadership has done
in the House now, compared with
the Democratic leadership two
years ago, there's just absolutely
no comparison," Frendewey said.
"The Republican majority has the
best interest in mind for middle
class families."
Speakers at the event focused
particularly on Driskell's election,
deeming it one of the most impor-
tant races in the state.
When former U.S. Rep. Mark
Schauer (D-Mich.) noted Driskell
would be one of many Democratic
leaders headed to the state House
this year, he was met with some of
the loudest applause of the night
from the audience.
Referencing the need to oust
Ouimet, Irwin said he agreed that
Driskell's election would be an
indispensible .part of the Demo-
crats' effort to gain the majority in
the chamber.
"I've been working real hard
with (state Rep. Kate Segal (D-
Battle Creek)) to try to get Demo-

crats elected all over the state, but
when you look at the statewide
map, it becomes clear that the path
to the gavel goes through western
Washtenaw," he said.
The rally also served as a get-
out-the-vote effort, coming a little
more than a week before Election
Day. Segal, who could become
the first female Speaker of the

Debbie Dingell echoed Segal's

Tirpak said she is also con-
cerned about renovations occur-
ring near her part of the building,
which may make it particularly
vulnerable to high wind.
"I am actually a little bit.con-
cerned (because) there is con-
struction next to us," Tirpak
said. "It makes me nervous that
it might get loose or something
through or something since it is
at out room's level."
LSA junior Elana Firsht, fel-
low MIW participant, said she
also plans to stay inside until
the storm passes, noting that
her office at the Brookings insti-
tution, an independent policy
research firm, is closed Monday.
"I don't think it's a very good

Two members of the Univer-
sity's Debate Team, LSA junior
Kevin Hirn and LSA senior Kyle
Deming, have been at a compe-
tition at Harvard University in
Cambridge, Mass., since Friday.
The team was scheduled to
leave Monday evening, but they
learned Sunday they would be
stranded in the Boston area until
Tuesday afternoon. As of Sun-
day, the team's flight has been
rescheduled twice, first forTues-
day morning and then for Tues-
day afternoon. Aaron Kall, the
director of the debate program,
said debaters had to extend their
rental car and hotel reservations

through Tuesday.
"We're cautiously optimis-
tic and planning for a Tuesday
departure," Kall said.
Kall said the team's remaining
debate against Michigan State
Universityscheduled for Monday
is still set to occur as of Sunday.
The team is scheduled to host its
17th annual high-school debate
tournament Friday, an event
which is expected to attract
more than 700 high-school stu-
dents, debate coaches andjudges
from around the country.
Kall said he is somewhat con-
cerned that traveling teams, as
well as the Harvard debaters,
may miss the tournament, but
he has taken-comfort in the fact
that the trajectory of the storm
is not expected to directly hit
Boston.
"There's certainly a chance
the competition could be post-'
poned tomorrow, but the hotel
hasn't lost power or anything,"
Hall said.
The Michigan women's golf
team is in Kiawah Island, S.C.,
for the Edwin Watts Palmetto
Intercollegiate competition.
Though South Carolina is south
of the storm, travel from states
throughout the East Coast has
been affected.
However, ,Athletic Depart-
ment spokesman Tom Wywrot
said the team's non-stop, com-
mercial flight is departing 'as
scheduled, as far as officials are
aware.

KALLGREN

Despite her determination,
victory for Kallgren will be
challenging. Aaron Kall, the
director of the University's
debate program, said winning
40 percent of the vote would
be an admirable finish for Kall-
gren, noting that it is difficult to
estimate election results since
it's not a particularly competi-
tive race and outside firms usu-
ally only poll in contentious
races.
Kall said much of Kallgren's
success depends on the level of
competition in Michigan for the
presidential race. If Republi-
can presidential nominee Mitt
Romney increases campaign
resources in the state, some of
the results could trickle down
to legislative races, he said.
In the 2010'midterm election,
Dingell won by a 17 percent
margin against Republican con-
tender Rob Steele, a local cardi-
ologist, though Kall noted the
election was affected by factors
such as the Republican wave
that allowed the GOP to claim
the House and the U.S. Senate
and the lack of a presidential
race.
Still, Dingell's margins of vic-
tory have noticeably decreased
in the last few elections as he
ages and deals with redistrict-
ing that provides him differing
constituents.
"I have never taken a cam-
paign for granted," Dingell said
in a statement. "The people of
southeastern Michigan rightly
expect me to earn their votes. I
intend to keep talking with vot-
ers about the accomplishments
we've brought here together
and about the challenges we
face ahead."
Dingell also emphasized job
creation as the most important
issue in the nation, adding that
there is still extensive work to
be done in establishing afford-
able health care policy and
protecting Social Security and

ing doesn't fulfill many stan-
dards under the Americans
with Disabilities Act, and its
upkeep is becoming increasing-
ly difficult and more expensive.
Though library officials
said the $65 million will be
enough to demolish the cur-
rent library and construct a
new one, opposing groups have
expressed concern about fund-
ing the project.
Katherine Griswold - the
treasurer of Protect Our Librar-
ies, a local movement against
the proposal - said the 30-year
bond on the millage may cause
the interest rate to match the
actual construction cost. She
noted that construction works
usually end up being over-bud-
geted.
Griswold said the bond
would be a burden for all Ann
Arborites, particularly senior
citizens who pay property tax in
the city of Ann Arbor.
"If the public would have
known we're talking about a
cost 130 million dollars for 30

years, I think that we would've

Medicare.
"I will continue to fight for
the people of southeastern
Michigan, because the fight
for making sure their voices
are heard in Washington never
ends," he said.
Kallgren said what sets her
apart from Dingell is her ability
to. connect with her constitu-
ents as she did in the 27,000
canvass stops she says she's
made this season.
"It's easy to see everything
as statistics and not real people.
Living in this community my
whole life, I'm building real
relationships with people in the
district," she said.
Wearing square-framed,
wire glasses, Kallgren hopes
voters see her as a neighbor and
a peer, just like them, who can
amplify their voices in Wash-
ington.
"They are ready for a
change," Kallgren said. "Some
of them are rather taken aback
that you are running for Con-
gress and standingat their door.
They're not used to that."
A native of-Wyandotte, Kalb
gren has lived Downriver her
whole life. Her husband works
in customer care at a plastics
factory in nearby Southgate, a
city where pockets of automo-
tive manufacturers sustained
a challenging blow during the
economic downturn.
As a consultant for the scrap-
book retailer Creative Memo-
ries, Kallgren owns and runs
her own leg of the company out
of her Trenton home. During
her time leading the business,
she said she became cognizant
of the vast challenges of busi-
ness ownership amid a tough
economic climate, and became
inspired to set her sights for
public office.
"You realize that there is no
minimum wage for a business
owner," Kallgren said. "You can
wake up at six in the morning
and work until midnight and
realize you made five cents an
hour. That drives the building
of your business: having built
been engaged," Griswold said.
She added that rebuilding the
library should not be a top pri-
ority of the city, noting there
are more urgent needs, such
as enhancing the Ann Arbor
Transportation Authority.
"No vote is not a vote against
the library system," Griswold
said. "It's just saying lets step
back ... We can come up with a
better plan."
While library officials argue
that the current building has
insufficient meeting spaces for
community events, Griswold
said downtown Ann Arbor
already has enough venues for
large gatherings.
However, Ellie Serras - the
chair of the Our New Library
Campaign committee, an orga-
nization in support of the
millage - said holding large
numbers of events at alterna-
tive locations is unrealistic. She
noted that requests for meeting
space have increased 20 percent
since 2009.
"The demand for that build-
ing exceeds capacity today,"
Serras said.
Last year, the library hosted
11 events at which attendees

were forced to split between

something on your own, surviv-
ing by your own wits, is part of
the American dream."
Kallgren said her experience
in small business has helped her
understand why many Repub-
licans believe that President
Barack Obama's policies have
hindered the growth of their
companies.
"There was no politician sit-
ting at their desk helping them
along. It was their own sweat,"
she said.
She said she believes govern-
ment needs to "keep their hands
off" businesses by no longer
punishing them with excessive
taxes and regulations.
Kallgren added that she
prides herself on selling strictly
American-made products, and
when she found out one of her
products was made in China,
she wanted to transfer produc-
tion to the United States.
However, after approaching
officials at her husband's plastic
factory, she discovered an Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency
regulation prevented the plas-
tic from being molded in the
United States.
"Government can be heavy-
handed and kill jobs," Kallgren
said. "They say they want to
create jobs but they actually
kill jobs if they don't have a bal-
anced approach."
Kallgren said if elected, she
will work to promote job growth
in Michigan by. decreasing the
tax burden on businesses and
cutting back on excessive regu-
lation. As Kallgren continues
her efforts, she said she hopes
her message will ultimately win
out at the polls.
"The current administra-
tion believes that if you throw
money at a problem you will fix
it," she said. "I think you need to
appeal to the best things in the
American spirit: to help people
to want on their own two feet. I
think Americans want to work
hard and that's the spirit of
being American: building your
own American dream and your
own pursuit of happiness."
two floors because the library
did not have enough space,
according to Serra. She said the
library hopes to bring more pre-
sentations and book reviews to
Ann Arbor with the new audi-
torium.
Additionally, she said the
current building does not uti-
lize energy efficiently, in part
because the building's heating
and cooling are controlled on
two separate floors, and a new
facility would help alleviate
these issues.
"Renovating (the) cur-
rent building doesn't work ...
Rebuilding will make the build-
ing much more energy effi-
cient," Serras said.
Serras said that library esti-
mates from four years ago indi-
cate that the cost of rebuilding
the library is within 10 percent
of the cost of renovation, add-
ing that construction costs and
interest rates are the lowest
they have been in several years.
She added that a renovation
would also be greatly helpful
for citizens with special needs.
"We have a visually impaired
library in basement, but people
can't get down there without

the help of staff," Serras said.

Defense the lone bright
spotin loss to Nebraska

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
LINCOLN - There were
few positives to be found in the
Michigan football team's 23-9
loss to Nebraska. One brightspot
under the Memorial Stadium
lights, though, hit like a freight
train.
It was senior defensive end
Craig Roh, who sprang out of his
stance on a crucial third down
early in the fourth quarter and

plowed straight through his
blocker until the stunned line-
man fell backward into Nebras-
kaquarterback Taylor Martinez.
The sack put the Cornhuskers
out of field-goal range and gave
redshirt freshman quarterback
Russell Bellomy and the fledg-
ling Michigan offense the ball
back facing just a seven-point
deficit.
On the next play from scrim-
mage, Bellomy reared back and
lofted a pass nearly 30 yards

downfield that fell neatly into
the arms of Nebraska safety Dai-
mion Stafford.
That scenario repeated itself
over and over againat Memorial
Stadium on Saturday.
The matchup not only pitted
the Big Ten Legends division
favorites against each other, it
set up a faceoff between what
are arguably the conference's
top offense and defense.

was a get- HELFAND
rich-quick
scheme, a bad
gamble, and like any bad gamble
it started with three things: a
man, a choice and a misguided

optimism. Michigan coach Brady
Hoke bought into the scheme.
He lost. He didn't lose his shirt
or his house but he lost the game,
23-9, to Nebraska on Saturday.
And he just might have gambled
Michigan out of a shot at the Big
Ten title, too.
Here's how the scheme
worked:
In the beginning, there were
just good intentions. And some
imagination, too, you need that
for the scheme to win you over.
Imagine the best two athletes
- senior quarterback Denard
Robinson and junior quarterback
Devin Gardner - on the field at
the same time. Imagine Robin-
son's legs and his arm, Gardner's
size and his leaping ability at

receiver. Imagine throwing past
overmatched Big Ten defenses
all the way to Indianapolis.
That's what Hoke must have
thought. He must have. And
at the time, it made too much
sense. The third-string quarter-
back, redshirt freshman Russell
Bellomy, was improving. Was
he improving enough? The wide
receivers were pedestrian. Gard-
ner could bring life. No need to
develop young wide receivers,
you could get rich quick.

quarterback developmentby day.
He groomed

round draft

and Jason

Auburn. NESBITT
The jour-
neyman coach
Borges came
to Ann Arbor with Michigan
coach Brady Hoke 22 months
ago tasked with perhaps his big-
gest challenge yet: Transitioning
the Wolverines from the spread
offense back to its pro-style roots
while still catering to the skill set
of dynamic quarterback Denard
Robinson, a speedster built for
the spread.
That duality birthed what
Borges dubbed the "hybrid
pro-style offense," a temporary
mish-mash of shotgun, sweeps
and I-formations that nobody is
built for.
And nobody is built to watch
it, either. It's been a painful split
between elation, when Robinson
slings a perfect screen or dodges
between defenders, to anxiety
when he tries to settle in the
pocket, tries to set his feet and be
a regular quarterback.
Has it worked? Sure, it's
worked some. Michigan has
managed a 16-5 record since
Borges took the reins of the
offense.
But it's hard to ignore that
something isn't there.
Michigan has failed to score a
single touchdown in three games
this fall - losses to Notre Dame
and Nebraska and a victory over

room at halftime to regroup.
His first drive of the second
half followed the same pattern:
Rush, pass, pass. So did the next
one. And the next one. And the
next one.
That sequence spanned the
entire third quarter, when the
Michigan defense was somehow
keeping game within a score.
That "unpredictable" rush-pass-
pass pattern is only unpredict-
able if you've got the defense
over-guessing on Bellomy like on
a multiple-choice bubble sheet.
(I've had like six 'C's in a row, so
this one can't be a C, right?) Gee
dangit, it was a C every time.
The fourth rush-punt-punt
drive, though, broke the pattern
because the incomplete pass on
third down was salvaged with a
pair of 15-yard penalties against
the Cornhuskers. That 30-yard
penalty equated to Michigan's
second-longest offensive play of
the game and was twice as long
as Bellomy's longest gain.
In the fourth quarter, Borges
decided to shake things up. So he
ordered up a deep ball to catch
Nebraska sleeping. Well, the
defense had been doing nothing
but bringing pressure on Bellomy
and sticking somewhere in the
same zip code as his receivers.
Bellomy lofted a pass down-
field, a few yards short of his
intended target and straight into
Nebraska safety Daimion Staf-
ford's arms.
The game plan didn't work. It
just didn't.
But on Tuesday, when Borges
sits down for his weekly press
conference, he'll likely say that
he wouldn't go back and change
anything, like he says every
week. He'll say the players just
didn't execute.
Borges is no fool, and that
would be foolish.

at stnesbit@umich.edu.

Redshirt freshman quarterback Russell Bellomy struggled in his half under center for the Wolverines, though the play-calling and receivers didn't do him favors.

Michigan State. Yes, thank your
lucky brunettes that redshirt
junior kicker Brendan Gibbons
powered a touchdown-less
Michigan squad to victory over
the Spartans.
The last time the Michigan
football team went without a
touchdown in three different
games was in 1962. That quarter-
back was Bobby Timberlake, not
Denard Robinson.
The Michigan offense has
carried drives into opposingter-
ritory six times in each of those
touchdown-less games this
season. That's 18 optimal drives
for the good guys. None of them
have finished in the end zone,
and only half of those drives have
ended with field goals.
The drives have entered the
red zone nine times, penetrated

the 10-yard line six times. But
none got further than the three-
yard line, that's where you'll find
the brick wall.
You can criticize the players,
you can praise the defenses and
you can make excuses. But at
some point you have to take a
look at the play calls.
There was a simple pitch
to senior running back Vin-
cent Smith at the 10-yard line
against Notre Dame. Smith had
a man open in the end zone, so
he tossed it ... well behind the
receiver and into the arms of a
defender.
There was Michigan run-
ning 10 plays in five trips to the
red zone against the Fighting
Irish and only passing once. If at
first you don't succeed, run, run
again.

There was a third-down give
to Smith with Michigan down 10
points that ended ina loss of four
against Nebraska.
Some of the calls just make
you shake your head.
And then there's the Bellomy
matter.
After Robinson was knocked
out of the Michigan-Nebraska
game in the second quarter
on Saturday, Hoke and Borges
turned to little-used redshirt
freshman quarterback Russell
Bellomy to lead the offense.
It got ugly fast. Like turn-off-
the-TV ugly.
Bellomy completed three
passes to his receivers and three
to the Nebraska secondary. His
final stat line read 3-for-16 pass-
ing for 38 yards and three inter-
ceptions.

Borges, also the quarterbacks
coach, didn't have a game-
ready quarterback behind the
injury-prone Robinson. A one-
possession deficit never felt so
insurmountable.
Granted, Bellomy got no help
from his receivers, who came
down with a case of the dropsies
as they are wont to do with Bel-
lomy at quarterback. But the
Michigan offensive scheme, com-
pounded by the limited playbook
with Bellomy under center, was
downright predicable.
Hoke swore it wasn't.
"I don't think so," Hoke said.
"I know what Al changes up for-
mationally, and, no."
I beg to differ.

Marquette, Mich., where the
Wolverineswill face Northern
Michigan twice, is a strange
place. Goaltenders turn into box-
ers like Shawn Hunwick did last
season. Points are hard to come
by. Last year, the Wolverines
took only two out of six in Mar-
quette. And this year, Northern
Michigan is much improved
from the mediocre team it was
last year. There are no easy
points the rest of the way.
And when the road games are
a crapshoot, split weekends just
don't get the job done at home.
Split series don't win CCHA
titles. Ferris State, last year's
champion, lost just four games
at home all year. And this is the
earliest Michigan has lost two
games athome since 2001-02.
The Wolverines simply aren't
accustomed to losing at Yost.
If they make a habit out of it, it
could be a long first half to the
season.

opportunity cost. If Robinson
goes down, who goes in? Do I
still play Gardner? Will he be
ready? And the kicker: is this all
worth it?
Risk. No doubt it's a risk. A
gamble, of course. You know it's
been a gamble all along. Hoke
had a choice between the known
- uninspiring as it may be - and
the exciting unknown. Hoke
gambled onthe faulty scheme.
He gambled on Robinson's
durability and Bellomy's ability.
Hoke chose to roll the dice.
For a while, it worked. It
lurched forward, as Gardner
became a serviceable but raw
talent at receiver and Robinson
fought through a persistent
right-arm injury and Bellomy
struggled in relief. It worked
until the bubble burst, until
Robinson injured his arm again
on Saturday, this time badly
enough to knock him out for the
entire second half. That's what
happens with these schemes.
The foundation gets yanked
away and the tower falls. These
weren't toxic bonds, they were
toxic roster moves, and Hoke
was praying for a bull market.
He was praying for snake eyes.
Problem is, this isn't Las
Vegas, this is the Big Ten. In
the real world, you hedge. In
the real world, you have a plan
B. You plan for what happens if
Denard isn't durable enough. If
Bellomy isn't good enough. Who
do you turn to then? Has Gard-
ner taken enough reps? Is Jack

Kennedy ready?
Michigan had no quarter-
back, no plan, no chance against
a Nebraska defense smelling
blood in the water.
Gardner wasn't an option to
go in at quarterback, Hoke said,
"because he hasn't practiced
there a whole lot."
Still, Gardner would've been
the third option, after Bellomy,
Hoke said. But he also said no
matter how bad Bellomy played,
there was no threshold for send-
ing in Gardner.
"Russell probably would've
had to get hurt (for Gardner to
go in)," Hoke said. So Gardner
wasn't an option, until he was.
He could've gone in after all,
but wouldn't. And Bellomy
tested that threshold, darn it.
He finished 3-for-16. He threw
as many interceptions (three) to
Nebraska as he threw comple-
tions. His longest plays of the
day were penalties. But don't
blame the redshirt freshman.
He entered in the middle of
the game in a hostile stadium,
with no run game. And, Rus-
sell? Score us some touchdowns,
please, because we're trailing.
Never mind that we haven't
scored a touchdown in 90 min-
utes of game time.
No, don't blame Bellomy. He
played just like the plan said.
It was hardly a plan. Hoke's
own answers said that. So that's
what the hollow plan looked
like. Here's what it felt like:
It felt like Robinson, trying to
throw on the sideline at the end
of the third quarter, and throw-
ing the ball down in pain. It
felt like Robinson caressing his

injured right hand with his left
as the game spun further out of
Michigan's control in the fourth
quarter.
It felt like Jack Kennedy, the
fourth-string loosening up on
the sideline. It felt like a medio-
cre Nebraska defense sending
men at the quarterback at will,
unafraid of Bellomy's arm.
And yes, it felt like a throw
into double coverage to a receiv-
er who should've been doing the
throwing in the first place.
Devin Gardner has said all
season he still considers himself
a quarterback, and before that
play, Michigan was seconds
away from going 120 minutes
without a touchdown. That's the
equivalent of two full games.
Yet there was Gardner, with
Bellomy reeling and Robinson
hurt, and he was trying to catch
passes instead of throwing
them. Gardner, the top quarter-
back prospect in his recruiting
class. Gardner, the best chance
at reaching the elusive end zone
again. Gardner, at wide receiver.
Now, it's easy to ask: How back-
ward is that?
So Michigan caught a few bad
breaks. Robinson went down,
though it should be noted, he
had shown signs of injury for
weeks. Bellomy played below
anyone's reasonable expecta-
tions. But when there's no
hedge, no backup, all that's left
after you bust is the long fall.
And, if Robinson doesn't
recover, a long, cold Big Ten
season too.

SHUCKS
From Page lB
Nebraska, which was stymied on
the ground most of the night, take
to the air with quarterback Tay-
lor Martinez. Also, on both drives
the Cornhuskers used a hurry-up
attack to keep the Wolverines off
balance.
Martinez completed a 32-yard
touchdown pass to receiver Kenny
Bell in the opening minutes of the
second quarterto put Nebraskaup
7-0. The second sustained drive,
which came in the middle of the
third quarter, stalled, but Brett
Maher's 31-yard field goal helped
the Cornhuskers to their biggest
lead of the night to that point,16-6.
The Wolverine defense held
strong on several occasions when
put in bad position by Michigan's
offense, including just after half-
time when Bellomy threw an
interception that deflected off
fifth-year senior running back
Vincent Smith and was returned
to the Michigan four-yard line by
the Huskers' P.J. Smith.
But when Bellomy threw
another interception in the fourth
quarter, the defense promptly
gave up the game-sealing touch-
down on three Nebraska runs.
The poor play on that costly drive
was what Michigan coach Brady
Hoke dwelled upon after the
game, despitethe defense's overall
success.
DEFENSE
From Page 1B
that averaged 41.6 points per
game, the Michigan defense did
enough to slow it down, nearly
splitting that scoring average in
half. It bent but didn't break.
The Nebraska offense posted
season-low totals in points, pass-
ing yards, rushing yards and first
downs.
No defense in the first seven
weeks of the season held the
Cornhuskers to less than 29
points. Martinez and Co. averaged
279 passing yards and 233 rush-
ing yards before Saturday; Michi-
gan held them to 160 yards on the
ground and 166 more through the
air.
But that wasn't enough.
There were lapses, of course.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
and senior safety Jordan Kovacs
pointed out the same faults. Mis-
communication led to the Corn-
huskers' first touchdown of the
day, a 32-yard pick route to wide
receiver Kenny Bell. Nebraska
struck with big plays. Michigan's
tackling was inconsistent.
They had myriad excuses if
they wanted them.
Three Bellomy interceptions
rushed the defense back onto the
field and into quick-change situa-
tions. Nebraska started drives in
Michigan territory, including one
on the four-yard line. There's a
good excuse.
"No," Kovacs said. "We take
pride in that. Our motto is: 'Spot
the ball.' It doesn't matter where
the ball's at, just put the ball on
the field and we're goingto go play
defense and not let them get any
yards."

"They did (have several big
stops), but if (Nebraska) doesn't
score, they don't win," said oke,
who lamented what he saw as
poor tackling from the defense.
"The expectations for us from a
defensive standpoint, we've got
to play better. If we're giving up
points, we've got to play better."
Meanwhile, the team's offense
could do almost nothing to help
out its defense. Though the bulk
of the critical playing time fell on
Bellomy's shoulders, the offense
couldn't get much going even
when Robinson was in the game.
And though it wasn't quite as
unsightly as Bellomy's perfor-
mance, Robinson - who should be
back for next week's game at Min-
nesota, Hoke indicated - couldn't
establish a rhythm in the passing
game either.
"We just got to move the ball,"
Roundtree said. "It starts with the
line of scrimmage.... The offense,
we've got to turn it up. We got
four games left. We got to turn it
around and score points."
The Wolverines find them-
selves on more tenuous footing in
the Legends Division race.
"We've got three losses for the
season and we've just got to do
better, because last year we were
11-2," Roundtree said. "Our hopes
are still high, because we can still
get to the Rose Bowl, we can still
get to the Big Ten championship,
but it's in our hands. We got to do
what we do best."
Senior quarterback Denard
Robinson went to the turf with
a right-arm injury in the second
quarter and never returned to
the game. And the offense, for the
second consecutive week, didn't
score a single touchdown, putting
the defense in an almost-impossi-
ble position. There's an excuse.
"No," Kovacs said.
Not at all?
"Nope."
How can that be? Because the
expectation is zeroes. Hoke and
Kovacs both stressed the simple
point that if the Cornhuskers don't
score, they don't win. Makes per-
fect sense.
It's just not so easy to do against
one of the best offenses in the
nation. Though the players and
coaches won't budge off the com-
pany line that says that any points
on the board are a disappoint-
ment, there were promising signs
from the defense. There were the
six tackles for loss, the Roh sack,
the forced fumble and the inter-
ception from freshman defensive
end Mario Ojemudia. The defense
held Nebraska - an offense with
a 45.1-percent completion rate
on third downs - to 4-of-12 on
third downs. No defense had held
Nebraska beneath 200 rushing
yards or 179 passing yards. Michi-
gan did both.
The secondary still has more
interceptions (7) than passing
touchdowns allowed (5).
Still, Kovacs repeated, "We just
didn't do enough."
"We didn't play well enough
tonight, but we'll watch the film,
make corrections and we'll get
better for next week," he contin-
ued. "It's a tough loss, but as I said
in the Alabama game, you can't let
Nebraska beat you twice."


SPLIT
From Page 1B
lift this team."
But Treais's minimal produc-
tion and the lethargic defense on
Saturday stifled the Wolverines'
opportunity to sweep. Michi-
gan forfeited the trio of goals in
a three-minute span after car-
rying a narrow lead into the
third period. It was a late surge
for the RedHawks, coming back
with vengeful efforts after being
tagged with their first defeat of
the season. Miami had suffered
the loss in its first road game at
the hands of Treais and the Wol-
verines' gutsy offense.
Though Michigan may have
provoked the weekend's scrap-
py play, it still stands with the
lowest number of penalties in
the conference (9.2 minutes per
game), but fell to third in pen-
alty kills (90.0 percent), giving
the No. 1 spot to none other than
Miami (93.1 percent).
The RedHawks, however,
were scorned on multiple occa-
sions, notching 20 minutes of
penalties over the weekend.
On Saturday, Miami bounced
back and racked an early goal
four minutes into the opening
frame en route to its 4-3 win.
Though freshman goaltender
Steve Racine posted a solid per-

formance on Friday, Berenson
stood by his decision to split
goalies.
Freshman Jared Rutledge let
one slip past him, surrendering
the 1-0 lead to forward Riley
Barber and the RedHawks.
The rookie netminder found
temporary rhythm as the game
progressed, inking 31 saves, but
gave up the three-straight tal-
lies to Miami in the final stanza.
In an uplifting two-thirds
of the game, sophomore for-
ward Travis Lynch found the
rebound off junior forward
Derek DeBlois and knocked it in
the net to tie it up deep into the
first period.
The Wolverines registered
back-to-back tallies as Gup-
till hammered the puck home
for the one-goal lead, assisted
by sophomore forward Kevin
Lynch 9:10 into the second peri-
od.
The RedHawks' clinched
the finale on a power play with
DeBlois in the box for holding.
Though the Wolverines closed
the gap in the last two minutes
with senior forward Lindsay
Spark's rebound goal, Miami
maintained its lead and secured
the win.
"I think we were kind of
sleeping," said junior defense-
man Mac Bennett. "That's going
to sting aeittle."

DENARD-O-METER

o/4 Michigan's chances against Nebraska effectively
ended when Robinson got hurt. Michigan fans can
only hope that Robinson will be healthy enough for
Denards the remainder of the season. If not, it won't be pretty.

MAN-O-METER
The lack of production from the running backs is
downright scary. They took no pressure off of Bello-
my. Defensively, 160 rushing yards against Nebraska
Hokes is somewhere between decent and disappointing.

HYPE-0-METER

3/4 Nebraska fans are nice. Too nice. Stop being
so polite and start swearing. This is football -
rationality has no place. The Cornhuskers were
Big Houses plenty loud, though.

SENIOR DEFENSIVE END CRAIG
ROH: Roh anchored a defensive
line that had marginal success
against one of the most potent
rushing attacks in the Big Ten. Roh
finished with five tackles, two for
loss and recorded the Wolverines'
only sack of the night. When
Michigan trailedby seven points
in the fourth quarter and needed
a third-down stop, Roh broke
through the line, tossed aside
Nebraska running back Ameer
Abdullah and sacked Martinez.
The sack forced the punt, but
the Wolverines gave it back the
next play on an interception.

REDSHIRT FRESHMAN
QUARTERBACK RUSSELL BELLOMY:
This one wasn't really fair to Bellomy.
The redshirt freshman saw his first
significant time on the road in a
hostile stadium. With no running
game. Trailing. And his receivers
didn't help him out much. Bellomy's
throws came nowhere near close to
being good or even serviceable. But
let's recognize that Michigan put
Bellomy in a position to fail, with no
backup plan to save the Wolverines
from a loss or to save him from
embarrassment. One start doesn't
forecast a career. But Bellomy's
got tons to prove afterthis one.
