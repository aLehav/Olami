FIGHTING ILLEGAL FILE-SHARING
RIAA
abandons
mass
lawsuits
Recording industry will now
rely Internet providers to
police illegal file-sharers
By AMY MUNSLOW
Daily Staff Reporter
The Recording Industry Association of America
announced last month that it's changing its strat-
egy for deterring online music piracy. Instead of
filing lawsuits against individuals, it is relying on
individual Internet service providers to discour-
age and prevent illegal file-sharing.
Under the new strategy, instead of the RIAA
threatening to sue individuals who illegally
download, the ISPs have agreed to pass on a
notice to their customers who are targeted by
the RIAA, informing them of their illegal activi-
ties. The ISPs will then have the power to slow
or stop the individual's Internet access if the
targeted person continues illegal file-sharing
activity.
Jack Bernard, the University's assistant general
counsel, said he is glad to see the lawsuits stop.
"I don't know why they engaged in the lawsuits
in the first place," he said. "We have asked them to
stop for many years."
Under RIAA's old system, which has been in
place since 2003, pre-litigation settlement letters
were sent to individuals whom the RIAA thought
were involved in peer-to-peer file-sharing. The
letters informed the users of their illegal activities
and threatened lawsuits if they did not settle by
paying fees to the RIAA.
The RIAA heavily targeted students who used
college and university networks to share music
files, including students at the University of
Michigan.

CGT Yi UDET CUT S
A 2 asks
officials
to slash
budgets
Departments face cuts of up to
15 percent of operating budget
as lawmakers balance books
By LARA ZADE
Daily StaffReporter
Though Ann Arbor hasn't been hit quite as hard by
the recession as other cities in Michigan, the state of
the financial markets and the loss of a major taxpayer
have led city officials to propose dramatic budget cuts
for the 2010 and 2011 fiscal years.
City officials are looking for ways to reduce the
budget without reducing services. Though the aver-
age budget cut is expected to be 10 percent, employees
have been asked to think of ways to reduce the budget
by as much as 15 percent. Other areas of the budget
could see a reduction of about 5 percent over the next
two years, Ann Arbor's Chief Financial Officer Tom
Crawford said.
The city has been facing economic setbacks since
2002 because of a downturn in the stock market and
a weakening Ann Arbor real estate market, Crawford
said.
But the University's purchase of Pfizer, Inc.'s Ann
Arbor campus adds a new challenge for city officials
attempting to balance the budget.
Formerly the city's single largest contributor to
property taxes, Pfizer paid $14.1 million in taxes to the
city in 2008. Now owned by the University - which
does not pay property taxes - the city will collect no
tax revenue from the land.
Even before the purchase was announced, city offi-
cials were already projecting a decrease in property
tax-revenues over the next few years due to the lag-
ging economy.

Daily Staff Reporter
The annual Mud Bowl competi-
tion gives fraternity and sorority
members a chance to showcase
their dedication to their chapter.
But at this year's game, one com-
petitor stood out from the rest.
After suffering a foot injury,
Public Policy junior Ari Parritz
continued to participate and cheer
on his team members, despite his
pain.
Starting this semester, Parritz
will bring that dedication to the
Interfraternity Council, the group
responsible for governing most
campus fraternities, as its new
president. Parritz said his main
goals as IFC president will be to
create a safer social scene and bet-
ter integrate the Greek commu-
oily into the rest of campus.
Before taking on the role of IFC
president, Parritz headed up the
University chapter of Alpha Epsi-
lon Pi. During his term as AEpi
president Parritz found perma-

collaborated with other organiza-
tions on campus. These collabora-

Vietnam War protest takes new form

In the spring of 1972, politi-
cal activism raged on campus as
f the Vietnam War continued into
another year.
On a festive day in May, the anger
of anti-war protesters reached its
climax when they dug four "bomb
:. craters" on campon to symbolize the
destruction that the war was causing
>> to the Vietnam countryside.
With music and speeches blaring,
the craters were dug in celebration
of Ho Chi Mi and Malcolm X's
f hirthdays, both on May 19.
to addition to the digging, other
symbolic anti-war protests were
. made that same day. The administra-
tion building was "mined" with bal-
y,. loons - balloons were placed on the
ground symbolizing explosive mines
- while four unidentified youths

was held o Ho Chi Minh and Malcolm X's birthdays. Protesters consulted the Uni-

versity when deciding on the four
locations to dig after the adminis-
tration expressed concerns that the
digging might interfere with under-
ground power and water lines.
Of all the locations, the Ding was
the most controversial place chosen
for demonstration and was strongly
opposed as protest location hy the
University.
Ultimately, the protestors defied
the University's requests and
threats of prosecution choosing to
dig in the Diag anyway. The event
provided a widely visible example
of the war's destruction.
Within two weeks of the digging,
arrest warrants were issued by
the University's Security Depart-
ment for Genie Plamondon of the
Rainbow People's Party, Jay Hock,
the former administration vice
president for student government
council, and two students, John
Goldman and Richard England.

NEWS BRIEFS
WASHINGTON
Feds: inauguration
attractive target for
terrorist threats
U.S. intelligence officials say the
Jan. 20 inauguration is an attrac-
tive target for international and
domestic terrorist groups, but they
know of no specific threat that
might disrupt the celebration.
An intelligence assessment
obtained by The Associated Press
says the high visibility of the event,
the presence of dignitaries and the
significanceofswearinginthecoun-
try's first black president make the
inauguration vulnerable to attacks.
Threats against President-elect
Barack Obama have increased
since he was elected. This, and
other considerations such as the
large crowds expected, factored
into security plans that will close
bridges and 3.5 miles of downtown
Washington on Jan.20. The securi-
ty perimeter covers more of the city
than previous inaugurations.
DETROIT
Despite gov't loans,
Chrysler unlikely
to survive the year
Even by the standards of bat-
tered automakers, Chrysler is in
dire shape. Its sales in December
were down a stunning 53 percent,
far worse than Ford or General
Motors, and analysts say it prob-
ably won't survive the year as an
independent company - despite $4
billion in government loans and the
possibility of more.
Things were so bad last year that
a single Toyota model, the Camry/
Solara midsize car, outsold the
entire fleet of Chrysler LLC's pas-
senger cars.
"Basically they're done," said
Aaron Bragman, an auto analyst
with the consulting company IHS
GlobalInsightinTroy,Mich."There
is no real possibility of turning this
thing around as an independent
company in my opinion."
Chrysler will not comment
on speculation about its future,
spokeswoman Shawn Morgan said
yesterday.

Obama meets with

Confronting a grim economy
and a Middle East on fire, Barack
Obama turned yesterday to per-
haps the only people on the planet
who understand what he's in for:
the four living members of the U.S.
'hpresidents' club.
lIan image bound to go down in
history, every living U.S. president
came together at the White House
yesterday to hash over the world's
challenges with the president-
elect. There they stood, shoulder-
to-shoulder in the Oval Office:
George H.W. Bush, Obama, George
W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy
Carter.
"This is an extraordinary gath-

ering," Obama said, looking plenty
at ease in the humbling office that
will soon be his.
"All the gentlemen here under-
stand both the pressures and pos-
sibilities of this office," Obama said.
"And for me to have the opportuni-
ty to get advice, good counsel and
fellowship with these individuals is
extraordinary. And I'm very grate-
ful to all of them."

Fighting raIelCs in Gaza
despite calls for cease-fire

Death toll nears 700
in 12th day of Israel's
campaign
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP)
- Israel resumed its Gaza offen-
sive yesterday, bombing heavily
around suspected smuggling tun-
nels near the border with Egypt
after a three-hour lull to allow
in humanitarian aid. Hamas
responded with a rocket barrage.
Despite the heavy fighting,
strides were made on the diplo-
matic front with the U.S. throw-
ing its weight behind a deal being
brokered by France and Egypt.
While the Security Council
failed to reach agreement on a
cease-fire resolution, Egypt's U.N.
Ambassador MagedAbdelazizsaid
representatives of Israel, Hamas
and the Palestinian Authority
have agreed to meet separately
with Egyptian officials in Cairo
Thursday.
Israeli airstrikes killed 29 Pal-
estinians yesterday after leaflets
were dropped warning residents
to leave the area "because Hamas
us yourjhu ses to hide and
smuggle military weapons."
The casualties brought the
total Palestinian death toll during
Israel's 12-day assault to 688 and
drove home the complexities of
finding a diplomatic endgame for
Israel's Gaza invasion. Ten Israe-
lis have been killed, including
three civilians, since the offensive
began Dec. 27.
More than 5,000 people have

fled the border area, seeking ref-
uge at two U.N. schools turned
into temporary shelters.
The fury of the renewed fight-
ing made it appear each side was
scrambling to get in as many hits
as possible before a truce could
materialize.
"I feel like the ground is shaking
when we hear the shelling. People
are terrified," said Fida Kishta, a
resident of the Gaza-Egypt bor-
der area where Israeli planes
destroyed 16 empty houses.
In Turkey, a Mideast diplomat
who spoke on condition of anonym-
ity because he was not authorized
to speak publicly said that country
would be asked to put together an
international force that could help
keep the peace. And diplomats in
New York worked on a U.N. Secu-
rity Council statement backing
the cease-fire initiative but failed
to reach agreement on action to
end the violence.
"We are very much applaud-
ing the efforts of a number of
states, particularly the effort that
President (Hosni) Mubarak has
undertaken on behalf of Egypt,"
Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice said. "We're supporting that _
initiative."
The army, which has refused to
allow journalists into Gaza, per-
mitted two TV teams to accom-
pany soldiers on patrol for the
first time. The footage showed sol-
diers walking through a deserted
street in an unidentified location
in Gaza.
The Israeli military correspon-
dent who accompanied the sol-

diers said they were concerned
about Hamas booby-traps. He said
they were shooting through walls,
throwing grenades around cor-
ners, going from house to house
looking for Hamas gunmen and
usingbomb sniffer dogs. Buildings
showedbulletandshrapnelmarks.
"We used alot of fire," said an offi-
cer in the group, Lt. Col. Ofer.
Hamas, meanwhile, fired rock-
ets, though at a slower pace than
previous days, hitting the towns of
Ashkelon and Beersheba with the
sort of longer range missiles never
seen before this war. Rockets were
still hitting the cities after mid-
night, but there were no immedi-
ate reports of injury.
Despite the violence, a sur-
prise announcement in Paris on
Wednesday put a spotlight on
diplomacy.
French President Nicolas
Sarkozy said that both Israel and
the Palestinian Authority had
accepted the cease-fire deal, but
he made no mention of Hamas,
without whom no truce could
work. The Palestinian Authority
controls only the West Bank while
Hamas rules Gaza - two territo-
ries on opppsite sides of Israel that
are supposed to make up a future
Palestinian state
Later, Israeli officials made it
clear Sarkozy's statement was not
exactly accurate.
"Israel welcomes the initiative
of the French president and the
Egyptian president to bring about
a sustainable quiet in the south,"
said Israeli government spokes-
man Mark Regev.

Federal budget
deficit estimated to
reach $1.2 tril.
WASHINGTON (AP) - Point-
ing with concern to "red ink as far
as the eye cansee," President-elect
Barack Obama pledged yesterday
to tackle out-of-control Social
Security and Medicare spending
and named a special watchdog to
clamp down on other federal pro-
grams - even as he campaigned
anew to spend the largest pile
of taxpayer money in history to
revive the sinking economy.
The steepness of the fiscal
mountain he'll face beginning Jan.
20 was underscored by stunning
new figures: an estimate that the
federal budget deficit will reach
$1.2 trillion this year, by far the
biggest ever, even without the new
stimulus spending.
The incoming president has
walked this same tightrope each
day this week - advocating fis-
cal discipline and taxpayer lar-
gesse together at nearly every
turn, though in every case with
little detail to back it up. With
less than two weeks to go before
taking the helm at the White
House, he'll make the same pitch
on Thursday, delivering a speech
laying out why he wants Congress
to quickly pass his still-evolving
economic plan.
Last year's U.S. deficit set its
own record, but that $455 billion
will be dwarfed by this year's.
The new estimate, by the non-
partisan Congressional Budget
Office, represents more -than 8
percent of the entire national
economy.
Still, Obama said "an economic
situation that is dire" requires
immediate and bold action with
unprecedented tax cuts and fed-
eral programs. More bad news is
expected today and Friday on U.S.

layoffs, and stocks plummeted
anew yesterday, wiping out gains
from the first week of the new
year.
Obama gave his first ballpark
estimate of the total amount of
the stimulus package expected
to emerge from negotiations
between his team and Capitol
Hill, saying it is likely to hover
around $775 billion over two
years. That's about $400 billion
less than outside economists
have said might be needed to jolt
the economy but at the top of the
range that Obama aides and con-
gressional leaders have discussed
publicly.
"We're going to have to jump-
start this economy," Obama
said. "That's going to cost some
money."
The president-elect said con-
cerns about increasing the deficit
to unmanageable levels swayed
him against the higher figures
advocated by some.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
also pressed for passage of a recov-
ery bill, though the mid-February
timeline she offered represented
another slip in the date by which
the package would be ready for
Obama's signature. Initially, the
goal was to have it finished by the
time he takes office a week from
next Tuesday.
Obama's repeated emphasis
amid the stimulus talk on a need
for spending control is aimed in
part at attracting more support
from deficit hawks in Congress.
He said Wednesday, without
details, that his initial budget
proposal next month will include
"some very specific outlines" of
how he plans to tackle spending.
That extends to the ballooning and
so-far unsolvable fiscal problem
presented by the Social Security
and Medicare programs, which
Obama promised would be "a cen-
tral part" of his deficit-reduction

Burris, Obama steps in

Burris:"my whole
interest in this
experience is to be
prepared"
WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate
Democrats beat a hasty retreat
yesterday from their rejection
of Roland Burris as President-
elect Barack Obama's successor,
yielding to pressure from Obama
himself and from senators irked
that the standoff was draining
attention and putting them in a
bad light. Burris said with a smile
he expected to join them "very
shortly."-
Though there was no agree-
ment yet to swear Burris in, he
posed for photos at the Capitol
with Senate leaders, then joined
them for a 45-minute meeting fol-
lowed by supportive words that
bordered on gushing. The events
came one day after Burris had left
the Capitol in the pouring rain ina
scripted rejection.
Obama had spoken to Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid on
Monday on the need to find a quick
solution to defuse the dispute,
according to Democratic officials.
Reid was told by Obama that if
Burris had the legal standing to
be seated - despite controversy
surrounding his appointment by
Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich -
it should be done "sooner rather
than later," said an Obama transi-
tion aide, speaking on condition of
anonymity because the conversa-
tion was private.
The dispute had taken on racial
overtones after comments by some
Burris supporters. The former Illi-
nois attorney general would be the
Senate's only black member fol-
lowing Obama's departure.

"My whole interest in this
experience is to be prepared" to
lead Illinois, Burris, 71, said after
meeting with Reid and assistant
Democratic leader Dick Durban,
himself an Illinois senator. "Very
shortly I will have the opportu-
nity to do that."
Neither Reid nor Durbin disput-
ed that, though they had declared
with certainty a week ago that
Democrats would not seat a sena-
tor appointed by a governor now
accused of trying to sell the seat.
Obama said then, "I agree with
their decision."
Yesterday, only words of good
will, with photos, poured forth.
Obama told reporters that he
knew Burris, liked him and would
be happy to work with him.
TheDemocraticleadersbrought
Burris in from the rain and into
Reid's spacious personal officejust
off the Senate floor. They invited
news photographers in to capture
the three - Burris in the middle -
laughing and chatting.
Reid and Durbin then retreated
from their won't-be-seated rheto-
ric and cast the dispute as a pro-
cedural delay caused by concerns
about why Blagojevich made the
appointment.
"First of all, understand we
don't have a problem with him as
an individual," Reid said of Burris,
calling him an "extremely nice"
and "forthright" man. "At this
stage, the process is working out,"
he said.
Added Durbin: "I've known
him for such a long time. We are
friends and on a first-name basis."
The embraces reflected a grow-
ing expectation among Senate
officials in both parties that the
former state attorney general
eventually would be seated.
As Reid and Durbin described
it, the process depends on two

developments: Burris securing
the right signoff on his appoint-
ment papers, plus a sworn dec-
laration that he didn't offer
anything to Blagojevich in
exchange for the seat.
"There was certainly no pay-
to-play involved, because I don't
have no money," Burris told
reporters after his Senate meet-
ing, previewing his sworn answer
to that question.
It's a key issue in resolving the
dispute.
Blagojevich is accused of try-
ing to get something for himself
in return for the appointment, an
allegation he denies. By appoint-
ing Burris, he defied Senate Dem-
ocrats who warned that a taint of
corruption would strip credibility
from anyone he named to fill the
vacancy.
Secretary of State Jesse White
also said he would not certify the
appointment with his signature,
giving Senate Democrats another
point of objection.
The entire Democratic caucus
then declared they would not seat
Burris or anyone appointed by
Blagojevich. They also said they
would not seat Burris without
White's signature, which Demo-
crats said has been requiredby the
Senate since the 19th century.
The scene yeserday was a rever-
sal from the day before.
Burris showed up at the Capitol
Tuesday to be sworn in with the
rest of the 111th Congress but was
turned away by Senate officials
who said his certification lacked
the required signature from White
as well as the official seal of the
state of Illinois.
Senate Democrats refused to
let Burris talk to reporters inside
the Capitol but cleared the way for
him to hold a news conference just
outside.

Accessibility sells
High demand shows merits of wheelchair-accessible seating
t was a sad day for the University when it was sued by the
Michigan Paralyzed Veterans of America for failing to pro-
vide adequate seating for disabled fans. Even sadder was the
fact that one of Michigan's central arguments against increasing
wheelchair-accessible seating was a concern that the seats wouldn't
sell. But after the vast majority of the seats were occupied during
this past season, it's even clearer that the decision to increase access
for the handicapped was necessary. The University, for its part, has
learned that improving its atmosphere of acceptance for all people
isn't just a good policy - it's a policy that sells.

It took an ugly lawsuit and months of
negative publicity to convince the Univer-
sity to add wheelchair-accessible seating
to the Big House renovation plans last year.
Under the requirements of the Americans
with Disabilities Act of 1990, when a public
facility like Michigan Stadium is renovat-
ed, the facility must be brought into com-
pliance with current federal standards for
disability access. This could have required
the University to make 1 percent of the Big
House's roughly 100,000 seats wheelchair
accessible.
When the legal battle began, the Uni-
versity dug in its heels and claimed that
the major changes to the stadium were
not "renovations" but "repairs," which
wouldn't require it to add to the stadium's
paltry total of 92 wheelchair-accessible
seats. Besides, the University argued, the
seats wouldn't fill if it offered them.
But last March, the lawsuit was settled
and administrators committed to make
329 wheelchair-accessible seats available
by2010 and to improve accessibility in
bathrooms, concession stands and ticket
offices.
Though only 184 of these seats were
ready for this year's games, the University
has reported that between 74 percent and
89 percent of these seats were sold.
Contrary to the University's concerns
that these seats wouldn't be filled, the
increase in wheelchair-accessible seats
was a success. Between 74 and 89 percent
is a strong showing, especially during the
football team's heart-breaking perfor-

mance last season. Clearly, the addition of
these seats fills a tangible need for disabled
Michigan fans.
But providing sufficient access to the
stadium for disabled fans shouldn't have
been such an after-thought in any case - it
fits right in with the University's vital goal
of creating an acceptable atmosphere on
campus for all people, regardless of gender,
race, orientation, disability or any other
status. The University should strive to be
a leader among universities for fostering
inclusion and equality.
While the high turnout of disabled fans
at home games was unexpected, it further
demonstrates the capacity for the Univer-
sity to have a friendly environment for all
of its inhabitants.
Disabled fans clearly believe in the sta-
dium's potential to be a welcoming place
for them, and administrators should have
every reason to believe that tickets for the
rest of the wheelchair-accessible seats will
sell well when the renovations are com-
plete.
The lack of handicap-accessible seating
in the stadium may have begun as a major
blow to the University's credibility, but the
high success rate of the new seats means
that the disabled community forgives the
University for its missteps.
The installation of the rest of the wheel-
chair-accessible seats will not only rec-
tify a once grave mistake, but it will again
demonstrate to the University that a more
inclusive stadium can be enormously suc-
cessful.

L ast month, the Pentagon
announced the potential
deployment of up to 30,000
additional United
States troops to
Afghanistan to
combat the Tali-
ban and support
the weak Afghan
government. This
announcement
comes at a time
when the Taliban IBRAHIM
is undergoing a
resurgence, retak- KAKWAN
ing cities lost in
2001 and gain-
ing popular support. In Helmand,
Afghanistan's largest province, an
estimated 90 percent of citizens sup-
port the Taliban. In recent months,
the organization has set up a paral-
lel judicial system, a police force, and
even appointed governors to head
parallel provincial governments
- despite the United States' seven-
year effort to minimize the Taliban's
impact.
Even with the millions of dollars
the U.S. has lavished upon Afghani-
stan's central government, the
country has not even come close to
matching the accomplishments of
the Taliban. Apart from the Afghan
opium trade (now accountable for
93% of the world supply), it appears
that little else is flourishing under the
new government. In seven years, the
government has not made significant
progress towards establishing order,
improving infrastructure or even
gaining the trust of the people.
- The general perception among
Afghans is that the government is
corrupt. In a country where the
president's brother stands accused
of heroine trafficking and where pro-
vincial governors have left their jobs
hundreds of millions of dollars richer

than when they were government-.
appointed (not elected), this is not
surprising.
Given the monetary expense and
the number of American lives spent
trying to establish this government,
one would expect greater results. Yet
despite that government's ineffec-
tiveness, we choose to reward it with
increased military support.
Maintaining military support will
not be easy. Just because the troop
surge appears to have succeeded in
Iraq does not mean that the same will
be true of Afghanistan. The reason
the Afghan war seemed easier than
Iraq in the first place was because
there were virtually no U.S. troops
on the ground. During the first and
most intense stages of the war, only
a small number of special and CIA
Special Operations Command forces
were involved in combat. The major-
ity of battles were fought by U.S.-paid
Afghan warlords who were backed by
American warplanes.
But that will no longer be the case
if we send in 30,000 more troops. It
will be messy, there will be many
American deaths and there will be
many more civilian deaths. The U.S.
has a horrible record of collateral
damage in Afghanistan. Earlier this
year, American troops bombed a wed-
ding party and killed almost 50 peo-
ple. And in a country where weapons
are abundant and blood feuds are still
part of the normal culture, you can
bet these mistakes create at least a
few armed adversaries.
Adding to the mess is the situation
in Pakistan. For the last few months,
the U.S. has been illegally enter-
ing Pakistani airspace and bombing
suspected terrorist hideouts, at the
cost of numerous Pakistani civilians.
Sure, a few terrorists were captured,
but our country also alienated a large
portion of the Pakistani population.

But the war is in Afghanistan, so why
does this matter?
It matters because 80 percent to 90
percent of supplies used by U.S. and
NATO forces in Afghanistan have to
pass through Pakistan. No matter how
many times the U.S. invades Pakistani
airspace, the Pakistani government
will remain a U.S. ally. But the same
cannot be said of the Pakistani people.
Last month, over 100 military vehi-
cles destined for use in Afghanistan
were torched or stolen. On top of that,
increased attacks againstconvoys car-
rying U.S. supplies have caused Paki-
stani truck drivers to strike.
The lesson we
haven't learned in
Afghanistan.
Since 2001, the Pakistani govern-
ment has posted hundreds of troops
along the Afghan border and lost
many of them. But the Pakistani gov-
ernment is now broke. This week,
many of the troops previously sta-
tioned near Afghanistan were rede-
ployed to the Indian border, a move
that can only have negative effects on
the U.S. effort.
We have alienated large portions
of the Afghan population, our sup-
ply lines are in jeopardy, and our key
allies inside Afghanistan are weak.
And now our government proposes to
send 30,000 more troops? Perhaps we
should take a lesson from the British
and the Soviets and know whencto quit.
Afghanistan can be subdued in the
short run, but it can't be conquered.

Scoring a spot in college

Applyingto college is a bitch. Only a little over
a year ago I went through this painful process,
and let me tell you, I would never want to repeat
it. The worst part of the application process was
taking the annoying, stressful standardized
tests. I ended up with less than perfect scores
both times I took the ACT and was kicked out of
the SAT (note: havingthe same cell phone as your
sister and unknowingly putting them in your
purse is a bad idea - test proctors don't appreci-
ate Fall Out Boy ringtones). There is no way to
avoid the stress involved in testing, but now the
College Board is making it downright unfair. A
new policy has been put in place for SAT testing
called Score Choice, which is about as ridiculous
as it sounds.
The new policy is fairly simple: high school
students can take the test as many times as they
want and decide which specific scores to send to
their colleges of choice. Students can hide any
undesirable scores from schools they are apply-
ing to by notsubmittingtheir lower scores. So if a
student takes the test 3 times and only wants one
score sent, the other scores are hidden from col-
leges, when in the past, all the scores were sent
automatically. The College Board argues that
this makes the testing experience less stressful
for students, alleviating some of the pressure and
giving them more control over their scores and
futures. I begto differ.
What the College Board must fail to realize
is that the new policy further widens the gap
between the low-income, under-privileged col-
lege bound kids and the high-income, Harvard-
bound-with-a-bribe-from-Daddy kids. Now that
the test can be taken as many times as desired
without any worry, those kids who can afford
coaching, study groups and 10 tests will have an
extremely unfair advantage. The kids who can't
afford any of these benefits will only be put at

even more of a disadvantage because they won't
have the luxury of selecting their best scores
among a dozen SAT attempts. With this policy,
students' abilities are being measured by the
money they can spend rather than by the talents
they possess in academics. The policy isn't pro-
moting equal opportunity for all students, but
rather makinga problem that already exists even
worse.
Standardized tests are coined to be "an accu-
rate predictor of a student's success at the col-
lege level," and Score Choice simply isn't living
up to this expectation. The only thing that Score
Choice will be showing is that rich kids are good
at memorizing how to get a perfect score on the
SAT. Greatschools can selectthosestudents with
top scores, but they won't be prepared for a cam-
pus where clearing away bad test scores with a
few extra swipes of a credit card isn't an option.
If a college sees a perfect 2400 from a student,
they are bound to get accepted. However, the
school has no way of knowing if that was the
first or tenth time that student took the exam. In
turn, colleges cans suffer because the SAT is inac-
curately representing of the type of student the
school is admitting.
In a way, this policy is promoting a dishonest
way to get somewhere you want to be. It also pro-
motes a false sense of security among students,
making them feel like if they screw up it doesn't
matter because no one will have to know. This
message is completely contradictoryto whatget-
ting a college education is all about. Though it
would be nice to make the SAT less stressful -
I was kicked out, remember? - all Score Choice
does it makes it easier for privileged kids to get
into college, learning all the wrong lessons on
the way.

What rankings don't show

friend of mine from high
school recently called to boast
about the ranking of her col-
lege, Sarah Law-
rence, on the
new Best Ameri-
can Colleges list
posted by Forbes ,
magazine. "We're e.
number 25," she
said conceitedly,
then paused, "and A
Michigan came in MATTHEW
at 161." At first, I
laughed in disbe- GREEN
lief. How could
any respectable
publication ignore the prestige, his-
tory, and academic distinction of the
University of Michigan? How could
schools I've never even heard of rank
so much higher than "the Harvard of
the West"? But when I checked the
website, I found it was sadly true.
Then I remembered exactly how
enviably Michigan has been rated in
the past. US News & World Report
currently ranks us the 26th best
school overall, and the 4th best pub-
lic university in the country. At the
same time, the Times of London has
rated us the 18th best institution in the
world. With recognition like that, one
has to wonder specifically how Forbes
carried out their rating. I thought I'd
find out for myself.
According to its website, Forbes'
grading scale is based on course and
professorevaluations, alumniprestige,
graduation statistics, faculty accom-
-plishment and the amount of debt
held by graduates after four years. But
I got the impression that something is
missing in that description.
Swallowing °my pride, I searched
for my friend's school towards the

top of the page. Sarah Lawrence has
previously not been ranked by other
magazines, like US News & World
Report, in part because they do not
accept standardized test scores in
their admissions process. According
to the New York Times, Sarah Law-
erance is officially the most expen-
sive college in the United States, with
tuition at $52,210 a year. And with the
average tuition of the list's top twen-
ty-five schools at $47,668, it's clear
Forbes believes that when it comes
to quality education, it's all about the
Benjamins.
Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised,
to find that in the magazine that calls
itself the "Capitalist Tool." After all, if
it asserts the omnipotence of money,
then it's understandable that the
schools it reveres most should be the
most expensive. Still, I'm not sure if
I'm willing to draw the same conclu-
sion. Pardon my thinly-veiled school
spirit, but Michigan genuinely has
everything that other schools have
and more - without the haughtiness
or the expense.
From time to time I hear Univer-
sity of Michigan students are, in fact,
elitist, but compared to students at
countless other colleges and univer-
sities, they really aren't. Certainly
many of the schools that Forbes
ranked highly have substantially
more pompous reputations. Wol-
verines, by contrast, have a healthy
understanding that their education is
both Ivy-influenced and corn-fed. In
this middle ground, Ann Arbor offers
a prestigious yet unpretentious atmo-
sphere that opens the door to objec-
tive thinking.
To be sure, elitism arguably has a
place in academics, where determi-
nation and pushing the envelope are

inherent. But snobbery should not
necessarily be a requisite for quality
education, particularly when a stu-
dent's conceit is more a condition of
his trust fund than his intellect. The
University does not have a history of
catering to a notably wealthy student
body. On the contrary, Michigan has
historically been a haven for stu-
dents discriminated against at other
schools.
As both a colossal research univer-
sity and a multifaceted liberal arts
school, the University of Michigan
weaves a fabric of perspective neces-
sary for its students to truly become

Why :Michigan
doesn't deserve to
be ranked 161st
the nation's leaders. And, by accepting
more private funding than any other
state school in the nationMichigan
operates more like a combination
between public and private. It's these
very combinations of the best of both
worlds that makes a Michigan educa-

We hear that all the time, from
fellow Wolverines. But what's most
telling is how highly people outside
of the Michigan community regard
the University, particularly on the
East Coast and abroad. We have
much to keep us proud in Ann Arbor,
and regardless of what Forbes might

PUMPING UP THE
VOLUME
After a sloppy first half,
Wolverines amp up the
intensity in OT thriller

By ALEX PROSPERI
Daily Sports Writer
BLOOMINGTON - Michigan
coach John Beilein grabbed his
jacket, picked up his water, put his
head down and started walking
back to the Michigan locker room
at halftime.
Then he looked up at the score-
board to see if that had really just
happened.
Against an Indiana team with a
5-8 record and nine freshmen, his
team trailed 39-22.
But Beilein knew exactly what to
focus on.
"The big thing was poise, poise,
poise," Beilein said. "We cannot
win this game if everybody tries to
do it all by themselves. Just don't
lose your poise. And for a young
team, we did pretty well."
Michigan responded by pulling
out a 72-66 overtime victory and
its first win at Assembly Hall since
1995.
This isn't the first game the
Wolverines have come out flat this
season against a team they were
expected to beat. Michigan faced
a 20-point halftime deficit before
pulling out a 66-64 overtime win
over Savannah State in late Novem-
ber.
The Wolverines (2-1 Big Ten,
12-3 overall) dominated the extra
period thanks in part to 3-pointers
from sophomore Kelvin Grady, who
made his first start of the year, and

redshirt freshman Laval Lucas-
Perry, who poured in a game-high
18 points. Indiana shot just 3-of-9
from the foul line in the five-min-
ute span.
Fifth-year senior guard C.J. Lee
said Beilein's message was to "be
the better team for five minutes,"
and Michigan certainly was.
But to reach overtime, the Wol-
verines had to stay poised while
down by six with less than one
minute remaining in regulation.
After sophomore Manny Har-
ris hit a 3-pointer from the left
wing, Michigan put on the full-
court press. Indiana quickly beat
it and Lee found himself defend-
ing a 2-on-1 fastbreak. But Indiana
junior Devan Dumes exposed the
ball for a quick second, allowing
Lee to poke it away, and the ball
ended up in Grady's hands.
"I just tried to make a play," Lee
said. "I was actuallytryingto set up
for a charge."
The next time down the floor,
Lucas-Perry's 3-point attempt hit
the front of the rim, bounced up
and swished through the net to tie
the game.
The basket capped a 15-6 Michi-
gan run over the game's last eight
minutes.
Indiana failed to score at the end
of regulation, sending the game to
overtime.
Lee's play was the difference-
maker at the end, but Beilein said
he felt the momentum began to

Sophomore Manny Harris was linited to just 17 points on 4-of-12 shooting on the night, but he made clutch free throws down the stretch to seal a 72-66 Michigan win.

shift earlier in the half. Down
48-35 with less than 13 minutes
remaining, freshmen Zack Novak
and Stu Douglass hit back-to-back
3-pointers. For the first time all
game, Michigan looked like it had
a chance to win. But Indiana came
right back and the Wolverines went
scoreless for more than three min-

utes.
Michigan played the worst it had
all year on both ends of the court
against Indiana (0-2, 5-9), which
ranks last in the Big Ten in more
than half of the major statistical
categories.
"We played a terrible first half,"
Lee said. "We'll have to look at that

tape and see what we did wrong."
Before halftime, the Wolverines
shot a measly 25 percent from the
field and were just 3-for-18 from
behind the arc. Harris even sent
a scoop-layup attempt over the
backboard. And on the defensive,
end, Michigan didn't close out on
Indiana's shooters well and gave up

numerous easy layups.
But in the end, the scrappy come-
back win kept Michigan's NCAA
Tournament hopes alive.
"We didn't quit ... I thought that
was a big point for us," Beilein said.
"And maybe at the end of the sea-
son, we'll lookback at that as a pret-
ty important part of the season."

Grady
shines
in first
start
A starter last year,
sophomore makes
most of return in
comeback win
By RUTH LINCOLN
Daily Sports Editor
BLOOMINGTON - Kelvin
Grady had been patient.
The sophomore point guard,
who started 25 games as a fresh-
man, came off
the bench in all NOTEBOOK
14 of the Michi-
gan men's basketball team's games
this season.
But then an opportunity pre-
sented itself. In last night's 72-66
overtime win at Indiana, Grady
got the start over fifth-year senior
point guard David Merritt.
"Sometimes (Michigan) coach
(John Beilein) has different ideas
in his head," Grady said. "I'd love
to start, but I wanted to win....
It felt good. I wanted to lead the
team for him."
Merritt couldn't practice yes-
terday because of an intestinal
virus and saw limited action last
night.
Beilein has said he likes the
spark Grady provides off the
bench. The Grand Rapids native
is fifth on the team this season in
minutes per game.
In 35 minutes last night, Grady
contrplled the floor, especially on
the fast break. He connected on
two 3-pointers and led Michigan
with four assists.
A quiet six points won't impress
anyone who looks at the box score,
but Grady's game is about more
than just a stat line.
wA talkative person, Grady is
known among teammates as a
vocal leader - somethingthe Wol-
verines relied on last night during
their 20-point comeback.

Indiana coach Tom Crean was visibly frustrated as his team let a17-point halftime lead slip after the break. Although Michi-
gan hadn't held a lead since the first few minutes of the game, it clinched an overtime win in the come-from-behind effort.

"At halftime, we're down 17
and he just wouldn't stop talking,
telling us to believe," said sopho-
more forward Manny Harris,
who had 17 points. "Some people
lead vocally, some people lead
by example. He did both of them
tonight."
With. 4:58 to play in regula-
tion, Grady reentered the game
and stayed on the court until
just before the overtime buzzer
sounded. With Beilein yelling
instructions from the bench,
Grady called at least three plays
on the floor.
"He did them beautifully," Bei-
lein said.
Sometimes criticized for his
inconsistencies and occasional
streakiness, Grady has improved
his assist-to-turnover ratio in
recent weeks.
But with just over 12 seconds
left in overtime, his old on-the-
court demons seemed to be
returning.
Grady brought the ball up the
floor and stepped on the line adja-
cent to the Michigan bench, turn-
ing the ball over to Indiana.
"I definitely smiled about it,"

Grady said with a laugh. "But I
thought in the back of my head,
when we go back and watch
film, Coach Beilein probably will
rewind ita couple times and make
fun of me a little bit."
FIRST-TIMERS: Last night's
game marked the first in Bloom-
ington for Beilein and all but two
Wolverine players. Beilein has 498
Division-I victories but coached
his first game at Assembly Hall
last night.
"It was one place I hadn't played
at in the Big Ten, so I was anxious
to see what it looked like," fifth-
year senior C.J. Lee said. "We
came to our shootaround today,
and it's a great atmosphere.
'It's a place you see on TV all
the time."
Junior forward DeShawn Sims
had previously played on the
court once and senior forward
Jevohn Shepherd had twice. In
those games, they combined for
seven total points.
Assembly Hall is one of the most
storied college basketball arenas
and one of the hardest places for
opposing teams to play.
Michigan is 12-60 all-time in

Bloomington.
ANOTHER ROLE PLAYER:
Sophomore forward Manny Har-
ris is averaging 32.8 minutes
per game. But when he takes a
breather, it's Lee who comes on
the court.
Like Grady, Lee's vocal lead-
ership is a big reason for Michi-
gan's turnaround this season. As
a fifth-year senior and co-captain,
he provides motivation on and off
the bench.
But last night, his minutes were
more valuable than usual. He hit
two 3-pointers late in the second
half to cut Michigan's deficit to
single digits.
"Huge play by him," Beilein
said of Lee. "He's really been a
captain for so long.... His defense
is something that we need."
ONE AND DONE: With the Big
Ten's expanded 18-game schedule,
last night's game marked the only
regular-season matchup between
Michigan wand Indiana.
Unlike in football, there are
no protected rivalries in the Big
Ten. The Wolverines will also
face Michigan State just once this
year.

MICROBREWERY
* From PagelA
Arbor location was straightfor-
ward.
"I live there, and it's a great
place to start a business right
now," he said. "Ann Arbor is kind
of a bright spot in Michigan's
economy."
The tropical-themed Dexter
facility exclusively produces and
sells oak-aged beer influenced by
souring bacteria and wild yeast.
Like with most other craft beers,
they do bottle refermentation - a
process by which the beer is fer-
mented after it's poured into the
bottle.
"All the beer has a lot of com-
plexity," said Jeffries. "We're
championing and putting forward
this whole notion of artisan food-
stuffs, and really beer is a food-.
stuff."
Ann Arbor's Jolly Pumpkin pub
will share the tropical theme, and
will use "as muchlocally produced
food as possible," accordingto Jef-
fries. The beer brewed on site will
be supplemented by beer from the
Dexter facility.
Jolly Pumpkin has five year-
round beers and a number of
seasonal and limited edition
brews. Luciernaga, which the
Jolly Pumpkin website describes
as a pale ale with "golden effer-
RIAA
From Page 1A
From 2003 until now, more
than 60 University of Michigan
students have received pre-litiga-
tion settlement letters under the
RIAA's old strategy, Bernard said.
Most students settled out of court
for about $3,000, he said.
According to a Dec. 19 arti-
cle in The Wall Street Journal,
this strategy change comes
r because the RIAA found the
lawsuits were ineffective in
reducing illegal music down-
loading. Additionally, the old
system created a public rela-
tions nightmare for RIAA after
engaging in numerous expen-
sive lawsuits involving single
mothers, young children and
one dead person.
LSA freshman Emily Sterling
said she is relieved that the RIAA
is no longer pursuing the law-
suits.
"I would rather lose my Inter-
net than have to pay," she said.
Bernard cautioned students
against thinking that this change
in strategy will be an open season
for illegal music file-sharing.
"This doesn't mean that all bets
are off," he said. "You could still
be sued by any number of indus-

vescence and gentle hop aroma,"
was listed among Men's Jour-
nal's 2S Best Beers in America
for 2008.
Once a rarity, craft beer is
now abundantly available for
consumers looking for a unique
alternative to the standard beer
selection. The Brewers Associa-
tion reported that craft beer sales
grew 11 percent during the first
half of 2008. Beer in general saw
a 1.4-percent increase during the
same period, according to The
Beer Institute.
Since its start in 2004, the Jolly
Pumpkin brand has grown in step
with the microbrewery trend,
with distribution now reaching
national and even some interna-
tional destinations.
Jeffries opened Dexter's Jolly
Pumpkin after setting up other
area breweries for a company
called Mission Management
Services Inc., including Grizzly
Peak Brewing Co. on East Wash-
ington Street in Ann Arbor, for
about a decade. The same com-
pany, which will oversee the
Ann Arbor location, manages
Caf6 Habana and the Blue Trac-
tor Cook Shop.
Jeffries has a simple philosophy
about his beer. "We're staying true
to our vision of what the beer is
and how we produce it - the tra-
ditional methods of our produc-
tion."
tries."
Bernard also said this new sys-
tem is not necessarily a perma-
nent change, and that the RIAA
could "change their mind" at any
time.
School of Nursing senior Kim
Wilke said she uses iTunes to
download music legally because
she doesn't think it's fair to musi-
cians when people illegally down-
load their work.
"Artists deserve recognition for
their music," she said.
According to the same The
Wall Street Journal article, the
RIAA claims to have prelimi-
nary agreements with some ISPs
to carry out these measures but
would not say which ones or how

State economic outlook reduced

Nonpartisan agency
said state revenues
will be $870 million
short of prediction
LANSING, Mich. (AP) - The
Michigan House Fiscal Agency said
yesterday it expects the state will
take insignificantly less money than
expected this fiscal year because of
the worsening economy.
The nonpartisan agency said
in a new report that it expects
state revenues to be about $870
million less than state econo-
mists predicted last May, a drop
of 4 percent.
Senate Fiscal Agencyeconomists
expect an even bigger shortfall,
with the state bringing in $941 mil-
lion less for its general and school

is a great opportunity for the two
organizations to pool knowledge,
resources and expertise, bringing
students and faculty together to form
a mutually beneficial relationship.
"U of M is a great partner. This
partnership allows us to bringstu-
dents, grad students, and working
faculty at U of M to do coopera-
tive research," Quigley said.
With the addition of the new
facility in Ann Arbor, GLERL will
offer a 3-month summer fellow-
ship program to University stu-
dents. The program could provide
up to 20 students with support
from the organization to work
in the research labs and collect
data.
LSA sophomore Jenna Cooper-
rider, who first became involved
with GLERL last semester
through the Undergraduate
Research Opportunity Program,
said she has benefited greatly
from the partnership between the
University and GLERL, receiving
college credit for her work with
the organization.
Cooperrider works on public
outreach for GLERL through the
company's website, and is making
a webpage that reports new inva-

aid funds that predicted. The big-
gest hit could be to the $9.4 billion
general fund, which it estimates
could take in $1.1 billion less than
the past fiscal year.
The agencies' directors and state
Treasurer Robert Kleine will meet
Friday at a revenue estimating con-
ference at the Capitol to decide how
much projections must be adjusted.
Treasury officials have notreleased
their estimates yet.
Sliding revenues already have
caused Gov. Jennifer Granholm and
lawmakers to trim about $134 mil-
lion from the budget. They agreed
to those cuts last month.
But more cuts are expected once
a new revenue estimate is released
Friday. The SFA report warned
that, "absent additional revenue,
very significant reductions will
have to be made in the ... (general
fund) appropriations."

The state expects to receive
financial help for roads, health care
and other needs through the feder-
al stimulus package being worked
on by Congress and the incoming
administration of President-elect
Barack Obama.
Granholm hopes the federal
revenue could help the state avoid
having to make draconian cuts. She
said last month that mass cuts by
the states would only further desta-
bilize the national economy. She
also said she does not plan to raise
taxes during the final two years of
her term.
Economists at both fiscal
agencies expect Michigan will
bear the brunt of a national eco-
nomic downturn. Joblessness is
expected to shoot up and per-
sonal income to drop this year
and next, with most of the pain
coming this year..

The SFA expects inflation-ad-
justed personal income to drop 2.8
percent this year and 1.2 percent
in 2010. It also expects the state
unemployment rate, which hit 9.6
percent in November, to grow to
10.6 percent this year and to 11.3
percent in 2010.
The HFA is even less optimistic.
It expects the state unemployment
rate to hit 11.3 percent this year and
11.4 percent in 2010, with a peak
rate of 11.7 percent in the first quar-
ter of 2010.
HFA economists said Michi-
gan's economy and state revenue
will be significantly affected by
the national recession, the weak-
ened level of motor vehicle sales,
the tight credit conditions and the
financial condition of the Detroit
automakers. They noted that the
state has had a net job loss in each
of the past eight years.

NOAA employees, as well as representatives for state and local politicians, cut a ribbon yesterday to dedicate a new research

members of the Greek community

community."
Jason Rosenblatt, the IFC's new
executive vice president, said Par-

ritz is the perfect person to make
the Greek community a more inte-
gral part of the University.
"Of all the people I met in the
Greek community he has the great-
est vision of how we can work
together to improve the vision of
the greater community," Rosenb-
latt said of Parritz.

collaboration is by continuing the
Lambda Alliance, a group made
up of the four Greek councils and
representatives of the Lesbian, Gay,
Bisexual and Transgender Com-
mission on the Michigan Student
Assembly. The group was formed
last year in order to increase sup-
port within the Greek commu-
nity for the LGBT community.
In addition to working with
other groups on campus, Parritz
said another one of his goals is
to make fraternity parties safer
for both Greeks and non-Greeks.
He said he plans to do this by
working with University Health
Service to better educate sober
monitors - fraternity brothers
who are required to remain sober
at fraternity parties to oversee
the party's safety.
"It's up to our executive board
to use these tools to continue
to make our social scene safer.
That's what they associate with
Greeks. The safer it is, the great-
er it is," Parritz said.
Last year, the IFC attempted
to enforce a bring-your-own-
alcohol policy, which required
partygoers to bring their own
alcohol to fraternity parties
if they wanted to drink. Par-
ritz said the BYOA policy didn't
receive wide support from IFC
chapters despite concerted

efforts made by the former execu-
tive board to implement the policy.
He said the new executive board
won't eliminate the policy com-
pletely. Instead, he said it will take a
different approach to implementing
social responsibility policies.
LSA senior Jose Nunez, the
outgoing IFC president, said he
expects Parritz to handle issues
of social responsibility differently
than he did.
"Ari's board will likely continue
the discussion on how to make our
community safer, however, I expect
he will focus on a more educational-
based approach, whereas I focused
more on an enforcement/policy-
based approach," Nunez said in an
e-mail interview.
Besides increasing education,
Parritz said he wants to involve the
Panhellenic Association, the unit-
ing council for 15 sororities on cam-
pus, in social responsibility policy
decisions, too.
"Having their support is really
important and valuable to us," Par-
ritz said of the Panhellenic Associa-
tion.
In addition to working closer
with the other Greek councils, Par-
ritz said he wants to improve rela-
tions-within the IFC. To this end,
Parritz and Rosenblatt are imple-
menting a new performance plan
aimed to help individual chapters
achieve their goals.

CITY BUDGET
From Page 1A
"Historically they've gone up
by the rate ofinflation or a little bit
higher," Crawford said. "But now
we're expecting them to go down
while our costs will still rise with
inflation."
In addition, the city has seen a
reduction in the amount of sales
tax revenue from the state, which
is the city's second largest source
of funds.
Though the city has $16 million
in reserve funds, Crawford said
the goal of enforcing the upcom-
ing budget cuts is to stabilize the
budget in the long run.
"Dipping into reserve funds is
not a sustainable way to fund the
operation," Crawford said of the
city.
He said using reserve funds is
a short-term fix to a problem with
long-term effects.
Besides budget cuts, replacing
the city's current property tax
structure with an income tax is
being considered as a way to sta-
bilize the budget.
The proposed change was

introduced by City Councilmem-
ber Stephen Rapundalo at a meet-
ing earlier this month.
The idea of an income tax,
which would tax everyone who
works in the city - not just Ann
Arbor residents - was discussed
about five years ago but reject-
ed.
"They're different philoso-
phies," Crawford said of prop-
erty tax and income tax models.
"How you design the income tax
could have different effects or
benefits."
Ann Arbor Mayor John
Hieftje and other City Council
members rejected the idea of an
income tax in 2004 due to the
belief that renters might not be
reimbursed for the decrease in
property taxes that landlords
would receive.
However, Hieftje said in an
interview this week he is willing
to re-examine the policy, espe-
cially after the University bought
the Pfizer campus.
"It's a good suggestion and
something we should look at,"
he said. "I'm happy to explore it
again, but with a lot of reserva-
tions."

Mitera to lace up tomorrow past for future

Senior captain to
skate for first time
since knee injury
in October
By MICHAEL EISENSTEIN
Daily Sports Editor
Nineteen minutes into this sea-
son, senior captain Mark Mitera
had to be carried
off the ice after NOTEBOOK
tearing his ante-
rior cruciate ligament. With an
injury that serious, many thought
it would be the last time he would
don the maize and blue.
But tomorrow, just two months
and three days after undergoing
surgery, Mitera plans to take the
ice and continue his quick recov-
ery. Michigan coach Red Berenson
originally estimated the defen-
seman would be out three to six
months after the operation.
"He looks really good," Beren-
son said. "Right now, he's been fit
for a brace (to) try and start skat-
ing on Friday. Not with the team,
but on his own."
Mitera has been a regular pres-
ence at practice since the injury,
usually sitting on the bleachers
just outside the Wolverines' locker
room. Yesterday, he slowlyclimbed
the stairs of Yost Ice Arena with a
small brace on his left knee as a
part of his rehab while his team-
mates skated drills.
"Everything off the ice has gone
really well - his range of motion,
his strength, his pain, his swell-
ing," Berenson said. "All that. is
good. So the next step is to get him
on the ice and start that process."
But Berenson was quick to add
that even though Miteralooks very
good, it's still difficult to set aspe-
cific timetable for his return to the
starting lineup.
And while there is no question
Mitera has been missed as a key
part of an underclassmen-heavy
defensive unit, Berenson has been
very impressed with how Mitera

"He's handled it well," BerensonO
said. "He's been very supportive of

uation. He's handled it like a pro."
BACK IN TOWN: After skating
for Team USA in the World Junior
Championship for nearly a month,
sophomore forward Matt Rust
returned to the Wolverines yes-
terday, and was feeling the impact
of getting very little rest over the
team's break.
"I'm definitely pretty tired, pret-
ty worn out," said Rust, who tallied
three goals and an assist while in
Ontario. "It's a long tournament.
We only got a couple days off in the
span of I think 30-some days."
But Rust, who played alongside
fellow Wolverine Aaron Palushaj
(two goals, three assists) for Team
USA, is anxious to get back on the
ice for Michigan this weekend.

The center tallied just two goals in
the season's first half - which Rust
called "embarrassing" - after his
12-goal campaign last year.
"On a personal note for me, I
think I played well and I think I'm
going to be able to carry over that
confidence into the second half of
the season," Rust said.
Team USA posted a disappoint-
ing fifth-place finish in the tour-
nament after a 3-2 overtime win
over the Czech Republic in its final
game. The squad had hoped to play
for a gold medal after finishing
third last year.
Berenson said that players
usually don't return to first-half
form after playing in the tourna-
ment. But with a series against
No. 6 Miami (Ohio) this weekend,
Palushaj thinks the transition back
to college hockey will be much
smoother.

"I don't think it's going to be
much different going from play-
ing the world junior players to
Miami," Palushaj said. "It's a good
transition from the tournament to
playing a really good team."
HOBEY WATCH: Voting for the
Hobey Baker Award, awarded to
college hockey's bestplayer, begins
tomorrow. Sophomore forward
Louie Caporusso, sophomore goal-
ie Bryan Hogan and Palushaj are
all in the running for the award.
Caporusso leads the country in
goals with 18, one of off last year's
nation-leading pace set by Hobey
Baker winner and former Wolver-
ine Kevin Porter.
Palushaj is sixth in the country
in points per game, while Hogan
leads the nation in winning per-
centage.
The field will be narrowed to 10
candidates on March 19.

TV on the Radio, buzz band no more. With the release of Dear Science, TVOTR has
entered into a rare and hard to define realm within the music world - partof a breed of
bands that are respected by all, challenged by few and enviedby their less-talented peers.
Radiohead is in this category; so was Pavement.
Dear Science, is an album with no unnecessary flourishes, no out-of-place instrumenta-
tion and no moments that sound even remotely close to contrived. Every single note on
the album is essential, like each individual brushstroke in a masterpiece painting. From
the claps on "Dancing Choose" to the breezy synth swells on "DLZ" to Tunde Adebimpe's
sweet falsetto "cry-i-i-i-lng," TVOTR has crafted 2008's best album, a brilliant work com-
ing from a band in the infancy of its career. It's staggering to even think of what's next.

audiences and critics nationwide with pastoral harmonies and deceptively simple folk-
pop arrangements; get tapped by Wilco to open for a leg of the summer tour, circulating
a'spirited live collaboration of Bob Dylan's "I Shall Be Released" around the Web to show

For Emma, Forever Ago. "Blood Bank" finds the one-time recluse trading his
acoustic guitar for an electric and his stripped-down aesthetic for a more full-
band sound. Still, no passion is lost in the transition. The song retains everything
we first loved about For Emma: wintry imagery, soothing melodies and a vague
sense of redemption. It starts off familiar, gentle and inviting, and builds slowly to
a climax of feedback and falsetto. If this is the sound of things to come, it could be
another very good year for Justin Vernon.

A better way to
eat healthy

The University's recording studio is located on North Campus in the Duderstadt.

Showcasing a new
generation of talent

t' all light!" is the large
caption on the Everyday
Food magazine I recently
received. Light? I might have to
burn this issue.
If you love
food, then it's S
sacrilegious to
diet. But, just
as you've done
for the past
four New Years,
you've resolved KARA
to absolutely, MORRIS
positively lose
weight this year. So how long will
you be able to keep up with the
cabbage soup diet or the I0-day
Master Cleanse lemonade purge?
One of the greatest pitfalls
of dieting is that it's difficult to
stick with it. Primarily, restric-
tion causes food binging. Who
wouldn't want to eat an entire
carton of ice cream after throw-
ing back cayenne pepper-laced
lemonade for 10 days? And fad-
diet ingredients can be difficult
to obtain. Many are too expensive
or just plain revolting; try finding
milk thistle or acai berry at Meijer.
And who has the time - or the
perseverance - to write down and
tabulate every calorie consumed?
Dieting can also have unhealthy
effects on the body. Quick, "lose-X-
pounds-in-Y-days" diets promise
rapid weight loss, but eliminate
little besides water. Similarly,
"500-calories-a-day" diets will
mainly rid you of your energy.
Even if you have the gumption to
stick it out, restrictive diets can
lead to malntriion and an unsat-
isfying relationship with food.
Finally, forthe love of food,
dieting is not for the foodies. Many
diets and magazines try to offer
customized meal plans and recipes
that revolve around sugar substi-
tutes and low fat stand-ins. While
the effectiveness of fake sugars
like aspartame and saccharin is
debatable, incorporating a few
low-fat products into one's diet
won't cure an unhealthy eating
style. And, though some maga-
zines offer good recipe ideas, lock-
ing oneself into any magazine's
customized meal schedule allows
little room for culinary explora-
tion.
Are you willingto sacrifice
dairy, red meat, carbs or alcohol?
Save yourself the trouble and
adapt a lifestyle change. Because,
like Wendy Darling, one day you'll
have to grow up; you'll want to
adapt a lifestyle that will keep you
happy, healthy and at a reasonable
weight. Eventually you might also
have to cook for someone else -
and I wouldn't bet on that person
enjoying flax seed paste.
So here's a way to permanently
enjoy food without dieting.
First, and most importantly,
aim to achieve balance throughout
each meal, day and week by incor-
porating reasonable portions of
each food group. You don't have to
cover the entire food pyramid in
one meal, of course, but you should
work to achieve equilibrium by the
end of the day. If you ate too much

bread at lunch, eat more fruit and
vegetables for dinner.
If you eat or drink too much
one day, just cut back the next.
Try to listen to your body; if
you're still full from the previous
night, your stomach will tell you
to eat a smaller breakfast and
lunch the next day. Aim to eat for
pleasure and not for weight loss,
especially if you're trying to shed
a few post-holiday pounds. If you
can incorporate in moderation
those foods you enjoy the most,
you'll be less likely to overin-
dulge and feel guilty about your
food choices later. You don't have
to cut out your favorite foods -
just cut back.
It's also important to take on
good eating practices, like sitting
down while eating or eating at
regular meal times. By adapting
such practices, you will learn to
slowly savor your food, encour-
aging fullness and healthy diges-
tion. It may seem like common
sense, but our fas-paced Ameri-
can lifestyle often leads us tolose
touch with proper eating tech-
nique, causing us to focus on the
television or computer instead of
our meal.
Learning to cook for yourself
also helps you get acquainted
with your food and appreciate
the ingredients you put into your
body. The most successful way
I've taught myself how to cook is
The downside to
typical dieting.
by trying a new recipe every time
I go to the grocery store. Pick out
one recipe or meal and write the
ingredients on your shopping list.
By eating meals you've prepared,
you'll be taking in less junk and
fewer processed foods, which are
more easily broken down than
non-processed food and have the
undesirable effect of being more
easily stored as fat.
Finally, share food with
friends and family, and work
with those you live with to adapt
a more holistic eating style. One
of the reasons programs like
Weight Watchers are so suc-
cessful is because they teach
a new lifestyle and encourage
participants to share their expe-
riences with others. Whether or
not you're trying to lose a few
pounds, a great way to de-stress
and enjoy the company of others
is over a good meal.
Adapting these practices will
help you be happier about your
food choices and will serve you
for the rest of your life. Without
touching any flax seed paste,
you'll be able to keep at least one
of your New Year's resolutions.
Morris just wants your flax seed
paste. Tell her why she can't have
it at karamorrisdumich.edu.

'new music' in 'New Music on the

genre, instrumentation or produc-

allows more creative space for

to follow their instincts when it
comes to music composition.
Unsurprisingly, the 2008 "New

"It sounds like if John Coltrane

Zuckerman said. "I was looking to
integrate different genres in the
most subtle of ways into my piece."
His piece also attempts to stretch
the idea of genre. "Modern acoustic
music is often typecast into a 'con-
temporary classical' genre, but my
music strives to embrace elements
of popular genres," he said.
Similarly, School of MT&D
freshman Vicki Huang mixes musi-
cal styles by integrating elements of
acoustic music with electronica in
her prog-electronica hybrid piece,
"Long Term Effects of Familiar-

Playing the proper deck

By JAMIE BLOCK
SeniorArts Editor
Let me start off with a simple truth: "Magic:
the Gathering" is the greatest trading card game
(or TCG) of all time. You know why? Because
it's the original TCG - practically the first of its
kind. Even though not every new trading card
game around these days is an exact replica of
"Magic"(I'm looking at you here, "Duel Mas-
ters"), they all follow the original "Magic" for-
mula in some way or another. But that doesn't
mean these new TCGs are any good.
There. have been some impostors that have
managed to make a good case for themselves.
"Pokemon" and "Yu-Gi-Oh!" cards both took
some innovative steps - "Pokemon" had the
energy card system, and "Yu-Gi-oh!" had cards
that could be played face-down to mystify oppo-
nents. But at this point, the new games are made
up entirely of elements from preexisting TCGs.
"Duel Masters," for example, even stole the idea
behind "summoning sickness" directly from
"Magic" without even trying to mask it as their
own invention. Worst of all, the general qual-
ity and content of the new games are tarnishing
the reputation of the classics, like my precious
"Magic."
2007 saw tragic entrances to the TCG world
like the "Kingdom Hearts" card game (yes, the
video game where Disney teams up with Square
Enix, the "Final Fantasy" developers) and agame
based off of the television series "24," where, in
an attempt to be unique, players build 24-card
decks and try to be the first to get 24 points.
Overkill, anyone?
Last year's offerings don't look any better,

with the release of a professional wrestling'TCG
called "WWE Face Off" and a surprisingly late-
arriving "Power Eangers" card game.
It's a mystery to me how all these games get
enough players to survive. You have to be a spe-
cial brand of nerd to enjoy the papery goodness
of a TCG in the first place, and with so many
games out there, each gamer would need to be
playing three or four different card games at a
time for all the different games to be successful.
And let's be honest here: You can probably count
all the "Magic" players who watch "WWE Wres-
"Magic" still beats
Squirtle.
tling" on one hand. In order to just break even,
these games have to pull their consumers from
somewhere. Could it be that these awkwardly-
unfitting games are actually creating new TCG
geeks? Should I be embracing these franchises'
attempts at nerd-pandering as a sign that my cul-
ture is now being encouraged by those who were
once so foreign to it?
No, I shouldn't. Sure, "WWE Face Off" might
make a nerd out of a bulked-up bro or two, but
that's not goingto change the TCG world for the
better. It creates a dichotomy similar to what's
already emnerging in video games, where all the
first-person shooter fans think the strategy and
RPG ganrers are wimps, while the latter group
thinks the shooter-players are essentially the
dumb jocks of gaming. And honestly, if you're

playing a TCG about glorified bullies, that's
probably a decent indicator. But then again, I'm
playing one about magical faeries.
Upon further inspection, the list of trading
card games released in the last few years makes
it seem like these games were never meant to
be lumped with TCG culture at all. I just can't
imagine a "Yu-Gi-Oh!" player who isn't a fan of
the British sci-fi comedy "Doctor Who" buying a
booster pack of "Doctor Who - Battles in Time"
just to see what it's like. The same goes for the
games based off "Avatar: the Last Airbender,"
"Battlestar Galactica," "Naruto" and "Pirates of
the Carribbean."
So it looks like we have two sects of card gan-
ers: Those who are fans of TCGs in general,
and those who can't get enough of their favor-
ite respective franchises. It also seems that, for
better or worse, these two sects aren't going to
overlap much. The franchises don't have to make
strategic or original games because the fans are
going to swarm to them anyway, regardless of
how terrible they may be (and they're usually
pretty awful).
I, for one, am going to stick to "Magic" for a
while. There's a reason so many other games
imitate it: It's really well-designed, the flavor-
ful worlds depicted in the cards are beautiful
and developed and the game is just a whole lot
of fun. So when you see me or someone else play-
ing "Magic" (which is rare, as we usually do it
in dark, secluded rooms and/or dungeons), feel
free to consider us nerds. We are. But when and
if you walk past a frit house and hear someone
shouting "Where'd you get a mint-condition
Stone Cold card?" please don't put them in our
category.

BEST ALBUMS
From page 1B
#4: Portishead - Third
After an 11-year hibernation,
former trip-hop trailblazer Por-
tishead has delivered something
much greater than a serviceable
"comeback album." Third is a rare
instance of a band truly redefining
itself. Portishead scraps its creepy/
sexy formula of yore for something
closer to creepy/ugly. As Beth Gib-
bons moans her trademark confes-
sional lyrics over jarringly glitchy
dreamscapes, the band achieves
such hauntingly voyeuristic pathos
that, at times, the album is almost
uncomfortable to listen to. For a
hint at the album's gutting abra-
siveness, the lead single is aptly
titled "Machine Gun." With Third,
Portishead has birthed what could
easily be the most innovative album
of the year. And while it may not be
pretty, it's anything but a misfire.

guitar part and added in effects on
Reaktor (music-synthesizing soft-
ware)."
The product is a three-min-
ute piece that uses heavy reverb
behind delicate plucking on an
acoustic guitar, an organic sound
that gently slides into glitch-heavy
electronic ambient rhythms. The
music itself is reminiscent of
guitarists like Kaki King, and it
sounds like Nick Drake backed up
by trance music.
Ching-Mei Lin, a PhD candidate
in Musical Arts in Composition at
Rackham Graduate School, derived
her piece from her discontent with
Michigan winters.
"The piece consists of two move-
ments. The first movement is 'Bit-
ter Chill,' which describes a violent
Michigan winter with fast and
restful musical gestures," Lin said.
"The second movement is 'Sun on
the Snow,' which represents the
visually content picture after a
harsh winter with slow, harmonic

sounding."
Lin's piece is more classically-
based (versus pop-based) and
makes use of the alto saxophone
and marimba, instruments that
produce both tense, quick-tempo
rhythms and longer, more drawn-
out sounds.
Jack Stratton, School of MT&D
junior, spits out some pop-tunes
in "EZ Mac," a song with Fresh
Prince of Bel-Air influences and
witty, ironic lyrics.
"I wrote the entire flow in a
freshman anthro lecture over
five weeks," he said. "There's a
little Afro-Cuban-meets-hip-
hop going on ... It-was all original
even though it has an old-school
sampled feel." The song itself uses
complex drumbeats and choruses
imbued with keyboards tickling
out minor-based melodies. Strat-
ton is a three-time "New Music on
the Block" winner.
Other winners include Stewart
Randolph, School of MT&D senior
and Kevin DeKimpe, a School of
MT&D junior.
Huang described the compe-
tition as a "good opportunity to

recording deal in the process.

#9: Times New Viking - Rip It Off
With their densest serving of
io-fi squalor yet, Times New Viking
proved just how listenable pure
cacophony can be. On the trio's
third album, melodies, guitar riffs
and'synth licks bleed together into
a swollen mass of tape-bursting
sound. The barely distinguishable,
co-ed vocal attack of Beth Mur-
phy and Adam Elliott is so fun that
the entire affair is almost childish,
but the feedback burst it pierces
through is so abrasive it should be
x-rated. Completely disrespecting
basic audio conventions, the dis-
torted bubblegumofRip ItOffrelies
entirely on energy for its thrills.
And that energy is undepletable.

quasi-sequel The Stand Ins, the
band relies on its effortless musi-
cal swagger while inscrutable
frontman Sheff turns an intently
focused eye on lyrical themes. The
result is one of the great bi-polar
records of the rock era. While the
country-inflected instrumentation
is downright giddy at times, Sheff
relentlessly sermonizes, with vary-
ing degrees of transparency, about
the pitfalls of being an artist. If he
truly suffers from any of the disil-
lusionment of which he sings, he
masks it well, because the album is
his most inspired effort yet.

#13: Department of Eagles - In Ear
Park
Brooklyn has seen its share of
talent lately, and duo Department
of Eagles is no exception. Grizzly
Bear co-lead songwriter Dan Ros-
sen takes his sophisticated Tin
Pan Alley pop in a slightly differ-
ent direction with the help of his
college roommate, Fred Nicolaus,
creating a sunnier and less dreary
collection of songs with arguably
more variety than his primary act.
The arrangements of In Ear Park
are vast, almost to a fault, though
the simpler pop moments on songs
like "Waves of Rye" and "No One
Does it Like You" give it a charm
all its own. While Department of
Eagles is more a project between~
friends than a full-blown band, In
Ear Park deserves an attention all
its own, which serves to further
highlight Dan Rossen's increasingly
adventurous songwriting.

#5. Vampire Weekend - Vampire
Weekend
2008's dubious "buzz-band"
award goes to none other than
(drum roll please) New York prep-
rockers Vampire Weekend. These
Columbia University grads have
been condemned for their clean-
liness in music and dress (which
apparently makes them sonically
and visually boring) and have
been accused of having an obses-
sion with Paul Simon's Graceland,
which apparently influenced their
record a little too much. Ralph
Lauren sweaters and classic rock
idolatry aside, Vampire Weekend is
a breathtaking synthesis of Afro-
pop and indie-rock that will make
the most uptight hipster loosen up
from e arms-folded, at-attention
positi n. When it comes to Vam-
pire Weekend, ignorance is bliss.
So, tune out the critics, put on your
dancingshoes and bask in the sim-
ple elegance provided by a truly
stunning debut album.

#6: Stephen Malkmus and the
Jicks - Real Emotional Trash
In a year packed with complex
andmulti-layered albums, Stephen
Malkmus and his backing Jicks
seemingly decided to just sit down
and record some really great jam-
sessiony tracks. Songs like "Real
Emotional Trash" ramble on for-
ever, but they never feel too long.
And Malkmus still has a talent
for enveloping listeners in quirky,
meandering tales ("Hopscotch
Willie") and commanding roars
like Pavement on steroids ("Balti-
more"). It's nothing too complex
and nothing too astounding, but
Real Emotional Trash is clearly one
of 2008's most pleasing, seemingly
simple albums, and it stands above
a whole lot of others.

#7: Bon Iver - For Emma, Forever
Ago
Given three months alone in
a Wisconsin cabin, most would
whittle the hours away by read-
ing, drinking or maybe just bang-
ing their heads against the wall.
But songwriter Justin Vernon had
loftier goals: He spent his time
creating one of the best albums
of the year and one of the best
musical debuts in recent memory.
For Emma, Forever Ago is a spare
and ethereal alt-folk affair guided
by Vernon's anemic falsetto. Its
deliberate pacing and dynamic
control make the journey from the
plaintive chill of "Flume" to the
triumphant thaw of "For Emma" a
memorable one.

#14: Atlas Sound - Let the Blind
Lead Those Who Can See but Can-
not Feel
Bradford Cox might have been
the man of 2008. Releasing an all-
out blast of fervor in Microcastle
with his main group Deerhunter,
Atlas Sound let Cox explore his
deeper, darker and more electronic
and computery side. With the elec-
tronic flourishes of Let the Blind
Lead Those Who Can See but Cannot
Feel found on "Recent Bedroom"
and '80s-like tracks like "Ativan,"
Cox went all-out on the emotion-
ally strong and complex spectrum.
Some of the tracks are rather com-
plicated ("Cold as Ice" and "Small
Horror"), but fit right at home away
from Deerhunter material. Partly
scary, but always compelling, Cox
knows what he's doing.

2008 was Weezy's year. The
New Orleans-raised rapper's Tha
Carter III was not only the best-
selling album of the year, but it was
also the artist's most ambitious
(and best) production to date. The
record treads the fine line between
hip hop and pop, producing a col-
lection that cannot be confined to
one definitive label. It gravitates
among repetitive party beats ("A
Milli"), soulful guitar-strung odes
("Shoot Me Down") and utterly
ridiculous sci-fi inspired concoc-
tions ("Phone Home"). Whether
he's comparing his haters to dif-
ferent seasons of the year or simply
making vulgar comparisons to lol-
lipops, Lil' Wayne's syrup-soaked
anthems have defined the year
and it's doubtful that he's stopping
anytime soon.

#12: Crystal Castles - Crystal Cas-
tles
While listening to Crystal Cas-
tles's debut album, you might get
the sudden urge to start shooting
8-bit fireballs andbreakblocks with
your head. With Atari synths and
gritty digital beats, the duo conjures
up heaps of video game nostalgia
while still managing to sound com-
pletely futuristic. But what makes
this album one of the year's best is
not the experimentation with clas-
sic Nintendo sound bytes. Beneath
all the blips and studio manipula-
tion are innovative and masterfully
written pop songs. "Untrust Us" is a
sing-a-long that's impossible to sing
along to - yet Alice Glass's seduc-

tive
Consistency in music is a lost art.
Releasing four albums in five years
is practically unheard of in modern
day rock'n'roll. The Hold Steady
has accomplished this feat with
great songwriting, solid musician- 4
ship and a unique sense of style.
Stay Positive continues to satisfy
with tales of love and faith mixed
in with the required dose of "sing-
along songs," as lead-singer Craig
Finn readily admits to be his band's
forte in standout opener "Construc--
tive Summer." Finn's vocal vitality
throughout the album solidifies an
underlying theme of growing older
while holding onto the best parts of
youth, which resonates with both
the young and old alike.
