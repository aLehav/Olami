The melody of "The Victors"
will emanate from Elbel Field
tonight, not from a Michigan
Marching Band practice, but
to celebrate the completion of

upgrades to the field.
The $L6 million project,
completed this summer, was
funded by the Office of the Uni-
versity's Vice President for Stu-
dent Affairs and the Office of the
Provost in an effort to improve
the University's recreational
sports facilities. The- updates
include the installation of arti-
ficial turf on the band's practice
field and the restoration of the
natural grass field, which was
named after University music

student Louis Elbel who wrote
"The Victors" in 1898.
Recreational Sports Direc-
tor William Canning said his
department received the money
for the project roughly a year and
a half ago.
The improvements to the field
began at the end of May and were
completed on Aug. 5. The new
artificial field, which replaced
an asphalt parking lot and band
practice area, will be used by the
Michigan Marching Band, stu-

dent groups such as intramural
and club sports teams and other
members of the community,
Canning said.
The company that.installed
the synthetic turf is the same
one that installed the turf at the

tice fields. Feedback from the

NEWS BRIEFS
NEW YORK
Judge orders jury
hearing for subway
bombing attempt
A jury can hear incriminat--
ing statements made by a terror
defendant after he was arrested
in a failed mission by al-Qaida to
attack the city's subway system
with homemade bombs, a federal
judge ruled yesterday.
U.S. District Judge Raymond
Dearie rejected a defense motion
to have Adis Medunjanin's state-
ments kept out of a trial expected
to begin early next year.
Defense attorney Robert Got-
tlieb, who had argued the state-
ments had been coerced, said he
was "disappointed, but we are
preparing for trial."
Medunjanin has pleaded not
guilty to charges accusing him
of hatching a plot with two for-
mer high school classmates
from Queens, Najibullah Zazi
and Zarein Ahmedzay, to pull
off what prosecutors call three
"coordinated suicide bombing
attacks" on Manhattan subway
lines.
After receiving al-Qaida train-
ing, Zazi, a former Denver airport
shuttle driver, cooked up explo-
sives and set out for New York
City around the eighth anniver-
sary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
He was arrested after abandoning
the plan and fleeing back to Colo-
rado.

The California Lottery said
yesterday that Ramirez claimed
her $9 million prize Wednes-
day and said she'd love to buy a

old has six children and eight
grandchildren.

McDonald's fumes
sicken 10 people
An 80-year-old woman has
died after being sickened by
fumes at a McDonald's restaurant
in south Georgia.
Pooler Police Chief Mark Reve-
new says Anne Felton of Ponte
Vedra, Fla., died early yester-
day. She and her husband were
customers at the restaurant. An
autopsy will be conducted to
determine her cause of death.
Felton was one of 10 taken to
the hospital Wednesday after

firefighters found two customers
unconscious in the bathroom and
others struggling to breathe.
Authorities suspect cleaning
chemicals in the restroom are to
blame, but the cause is still under
investigation.
McDonald's said in a state-
ment Wednesday that the restau-
rant reopened after authorities
deemed it safe. The company did
not immediately comment on Fel-
ton's death.

Obama calls for
cuts to Social
Security payroll tax
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Confronting an economy in
peril, President Barack Obama
unveiled a larger-than-expect-
ed $450 billion plan last night
to boost jobs and put cash in the
pockets of dispirited Americans,
urging Republican skeptics to
embrace an approach heavy
on the tax cuts they tradition-
ally love. With millions of voters
watching and skeptical of Wash-
ington, Obama repeatedly chal-
lenged Congress to act swiftly.
The newest and boldest ele-
ment of Obama's plan would
slash the Social Security payroll
tax both for tens of millions of
workers and for employers, too.
For individuals, that tax has
been shaved from 6.2 percent to
4.2 percent for this year but is to
go back up again without action
by Congress. Obama wants to
deepen the cut to 3.1 percent for
workers.
"This plan is the right thing
to do right now," Obama said
after a divided body rose in
warm unison to greet him. "You
should pass it. And I intend to
take that message to every cbr-

positive, Canning said.
"They no longer have tired legs
(or) shin splints ... they love it,"
Canning said. "With the march-
ing and cadence that they do, it
is very, very repetitive. But now,
it's repetitive on exactly the same
surface that they are performing
on. It's tremendous."
Unlike other fields at the Uni-
versity, the synthetic field will
offer athletic student groups a
space to practice and play for
more days throughout the year,
since mud and permafrost won't
affect the artificial turf, Canning
pointed out. The new field mate-
rial, which is made of recycled
tires and sand, will particularly
help spring sports like rugby, he
said.
Nick Cilifone, a graduate stu-
dent who plays for the Univer-
sity's men's club soccer team,
said before the renovations, Elbel
Field was difficult to practice and
play on.
"It was in pretty bad shape,
especially when it got colder,"
Cilifone said. "It was very diffi-
cult to train there."
Fellow teammate Kevin Zuss-
man, a senior in the Business
School, said practicing on the
natural grass field made it diffi-
cult when the team played their
games on synthetic turf. Though
he said the new synthetic field
isn't large enough for full scrim-
mages, he said it will be "good for
drills and small games."
The renovations at Elbel Field
also included a new, wrought
iron fence around the perimeter
of the field, which Canning said
was funded and designed by Busi-
ness and Finance Department

ne of this country."
In his televised address to
Congress, Obama sought to pro-
vide a jolt for the economy, still
staggering on his watch, and for
his own standing at one of the
lowest marks of his presidency.
He put forth a jobs plan that he
hopes can get bipartisan sup-
port and spur hiring in a nation
where 14 million people remain
out of work and the jobless rate
is stuck at 9.1 percent. Public
confidence in his stewardship of
the economy is eroding.
Obama did not venture an esti-
mate as to how many jobs his plan
wouldcreate. He promised repeat-
edly that his plan would be paid
for, but never said how, pledgingto
release those details soon.
The president also would
apply the Social Security pay-
roll tax cut to employers, halv-
ing their taxes to 3.1 percent on
their first $5 million in payroll.
Businesses that hire new work-
ers or give raises to those they
already employ would get an
even bigger benefit: On payroll
increases up to $50 million they
would pay no Social Security
tax.
Obama also proposed spend-
ing to fix schools and roads, hire
local teachers and police and to
extend unemployment benefits.
He proposed a tax credit for
at the University. The new fence
will allow the Department of
Recreational Sports to schedule
and supervise the field hours and
maintain the top dressing, aerat-
ing and seeding that occurred over
the summer to restore the field.
The locked fence will also keep
people attending the football
games from crossing the field
on their way in and out of the
Big House - a shortcut that
can cause a lot of damage to
the natural grass field, Canning
said.
"Our department, recre-
ational sports, has much more
control over the field now ...
(Elbel Field) will be open many
hours, but it will also be con-
trolled," Canning said. "And
being able to control it, will
allow us to have a more quality
field."
The grand opening of Elbel
Field at 7:30 p.m. tonight will
involve a dedication ceremony
and addresses by Vice Presi-
dent for Student Affairs E.
Royster Harper, President of
the Club Sports Council Jessica
Kraft and Michigan Marching
Band Drum Major Jeff McMa-
hon. After the ribbon cutting,
there will be games and give-
aways involving marching
band members and club sports
teams.
Other Department of Rec-
reational Sports projects using
the $1.6 million include locker
room improvements in the
North Campus Recreational
Building and Central Campus
Recreational Building. The
department has also installed
a new road and roof at the
Radrick Recreation Area, on
Dixboro Rd., which houses the
Challenge Program.
The funding will also allow

businesses that hire people out
of work for six months or longer,
plus other tax relief aimed at
winning bipartisan support in a
time of divided government.
Under soaring expectations
for results, Obama sought to put
himself on the side of voters who
he said could not care less about
the political consequences of his
speech.
"The question is whether, in
the face of an ongoing national
crisis, we can stop the political
circus and actually do some-
thing to help the economy,"
Obama said.
His aim last night was to put
pressure on Congress to act -
and to share the responsibil-
ity for fixing the economic mess
that is sure to figure in next
year's elections. For every time
he told lawmakers to "pass the
bill" - and he said over and over
- Democrats cheered while
Republicans sat in silence.
Tax cuts amounted to the
broadest part of Obama's pro-
posal - in essence, a challenge
by the Democratic president to
congressional Republicans to
get behind him on one of their
own cherished economic prin-
ciples or risk the wrath of voters
for inaction. The tax cuts alone
would amount to roughly $250
billion.
80 to 90 exercise machines to be
replaced at recreational facilities
by the end of the month, accord-
ingto Canning. Additionally, tele-
visions and cable will be installed
in select areas at the Intramu-
ral Sports Building, CCRB and
NCRB this month.

Street to South Forest Street
south of Oakland Avenue, and
the Oxbridge neighborhood, the
area around the Oxford Housing
complex.
Laura Blake Jones, dean of
students and associate vice presi-
dent for student affairs, said the
program strives to help students
transition out of residence halls
and into off-campus housing.
She said she feels it is necessary
for off-campus residents to know
one another so they can better
address safety concerns in their
neighborhoods.
LSA junior Stephanie Hamel,
vice chair of the Student Safety
Commission, said she has noticed
increased attention to safety
among students in light of the
assaults that occurred near cam-
pus this summer.
"I think that especially in the
neighborhoods that we chose,
there are areas (where) students
are really on guard right now and
really concerned about their per-
sonal safety because of the events
that happened over the summer
and last year," Hamel said.
Some students living in these
areas echoed Hamel's sentiment
and said they have been more
careful about their well-being
since the assaults and are looking
forward to programs that aim to
increase safety.
LSA junior SamanthaPrimack,
who lives on East University and
Greenwood Avenue, said she and
her housemates have been more
conscientious about safety since
movinginthis semester and hear-
ing about the sexual assaults that
occurred off-campus.
"One of the big things that
we've been really careful about is
never walking by ourselves any-
where, or if we are, having some-
one meet us halfway has been a
big deal for us," Primack said.
LSA junior Deven Kulkarni,
who lives on Vaughn Street in
the East Packard neighborhood,
said he feels relatively safe on his
street but would feel differently
if he were living just one street
away.
"If I were living on Greenwood
though, that would probably be a
different story, which is weird
because it's only a street over,"
Kulkarni said. "But they've seen
their fair share of crime alerts."
Primack said she is look-
ing forward to the increased
resources Beyond the Diag is pro-
viding for off-campus students.
"I think it's good that the
University is putting a different
priority on giving information
and keeping people who are not
necessarily on campus safe," she
said.
Primack also said he's noticed
an increase in police presence in
his neighborhood.

Jones said this was the most

"In my years of doing similar
kind of work on this campus and
other campuses, it was the most
positive response I've ever seen
from students," Jones said.
During the event, the group
passed out the telephone number
for Safe Ride, a new system cre-
ated by the program, which pro-
vides streamlined access to the
various late-night transportation
services provided by the Univer-
sity and the city under a single
telephone number. Primack said
she and her housemates posted
the number on their refrigerator
for future use.
In the next few weeks, the
program intends to hire neigh-
borhood ambassadors for the
Oxbridge and East Packard
neighborhoods, Hamel said.
Neighborhood ambassadors -
comparable to resident advis-
ers in residence halls - will be
students living in off-campus
neighborhoods and willhelpplan
events like barbeques and movie
screenings as well as contribute
content to monthly newsletters
that will be distributed to resi-
dents.
"Our hope is that students
will identify with their neighbor-
hoods as strongly as they do cur-
rently with the residence halls,"
Buoy said.
LSA junior Abby Krumbein, a
Walnut Street resident, said she
likes the idea of hiring neigh-
borhood ambassadors for each
neighborhood, but feels that it
might be unnecessary for cer-
tain areas where students have
already established a sense of
community.
"I already feel very communal
on Walnut Street because I know
a lot of people, and I have a lot of
friends around," Krumbein said.
Public Policy junior Gabe
Pachter, who lives on Forest
Court, said he thinks Beyond the
Diag is a good program for ensur-
ing safety in off-campus areas,
but also feels that the commu-
nity aspect is something students
should establish themselves.
"When you move outside the
residence hall, you make a con-
scious decision to be involved in
your own program and your own
social life," Pachter said. "But I
think this program is important
for ensuring student safety and
knowing there are people to go
to within your neighborhood if a
problem arises.

SEPTEMBER 12, 2001


FR THE DAILY:
SEPTEMBER 13, 2001
There are certain images in history
that stand the test of time: These
include Times Square filled for V-J
Day, mourners gathering outside the Dakota
Apartment on Central Park West to lament
the death of John Lennon and the multi-mile
line to view the body of fallen President John
F. Kennedy lying in state at the U.S. Capitol.
For University students, one of the many
images that will define Sept. 11, 2001 is the
sight of 15,000 people gathered in the Diag
the largest gathering of its kind in University
history. ,
Just as we gathered on
the Diag on Tuesday, our
university must remain
united in the days, weeks,
months and years to come.
Quiet, solemn and respectful, students,
faculty, staff and administrators still in
shock and quite unsure of what the future
holds gathered to comfort one another.
Since most students are away from home,
it is the University community that must
serve as one large family.
Although Tuesday"s attacks on the United
States occurred hundreds of miles away from
Ann Arbor, they were still close to home.
And in the upcoming, uncertain days ahead,
it will be essential to maintain the genu-
inely close-knit University community that
emerged that evening on the Diag. As Michi-
gan Student Assembly Vice President Jessica
Cash said, the University "seemed a whole lot
smaller" Tuesday night.
The University has offered its resourc-
es for students to deal with the stress and
uncertainty of terrorist attacks. Student
should take advantage of counseling services
in the residence halls and in the University
unions.
Thesother promising sign that came out of
Tuesday's events was the fact that so many
student groups of differing backgrounds and
viewpoints came together to organize the
vigil. The organizers, from MSA to Students
Organizing for Labor and Economic Equal-
ity to the Black Student Union to Hillel and
so many others, should be thanked for their
commitment to the University and to the stu-
dent population.
The heated Palestinian-Israeli debate that
has placed great stress on the campus com-
munity this past year, was put aside on Tues-
day. At the vigil, Muslims stood next to Jews,
Palestinians embraced Israelis.
We can only hope that Tuesday"s horrors
in New York and Washington will serve as a
foundation for tolerance. There is no doubt
that the Israeli-Palestinian crisis will be fur-
ther debated and connected to Tuesday"s
terrorist attacks.
Just as we gathered in the Diag on Tues-
day, our university must remain united in the
days, weeks, months and years to come.

FROM THE.
UNIVERSITY
The University of Michigan
prides itself on its longstanding
history of acceptance and
tolerance- of all cultures. These
assets are the cornerstone of our
education, and are integral in
good times, and an utmost
necessity in times of stress and
trying.
Yesterday morning's events have
thrown us into a catastrophe on a
magnitude;never experienced
before. The day has been
tumultuous; we don't know what to
believe; we don't know what to
think.
This crisis is an opportunity
for us to practice what we
preach; it is an opportunity for us
to come together, recognize and
pay proper respect to the tragedy,
and unite behind one another.
We are all in the same boat -
confused.
Things are difficult right now,
and they will be for some time to
come while we try to interpret
what has happened. Let's take
this opportunity to unite behind
our common values of diversity,
tolerance and acceptance.
Terrorism only succeeds when it
forces its victims to change their
practices, and we refuse to let
terrorism succeed.
As noted by President Bollinger,
if you have any questions regarding
counseling, help lines, or anything
else, www.umich.edu will have
continual updates as they occur.

There also exists the danger of
this event being exploited for parti-

tion would be one that validates a
cornerstone of President George W.
Bush"s administration: Increased
militarization..
Bush has been a tireless advocate
for increased defense spending, but
his plans dump billionsofdollarsinto
creating a military state that fails to
offer any real protection in today"s
world. Bush has largely ignored crit-
ics from both major political parties
who point out that his plan ignores
terrorist organizations and other
non-state actors.
Bush"s missile defense plan is
based on an antiquated view of
the international theater. Bush"s
proposed defense plan would have
been wholly ineffective against
yesterday's terrorist attack. The
United States needs to be more
concerned with the allocation of
its defense spending, and not nec-
essarily on beefing up any and all
military programs simply because
they once worked.
The question is not
whether the United
States will react
to the worst act of
terrorism in our
history, but what
sort of reaction
there will be.
These attacks willillicit a response
unheard of in American history. The
question is not whether the United
States will react to the worst act of
terrorism in our history, but what
sort of reaction there willbe.
Our nation needs to temper its
response and avoid knee-jerk reac-
tions to this disaster.
Even as Americans try to com-
prehend the tragedy of yesterday"s
events, the nation must begin to
cope with the harsh prospect of an
insecure tomorrow. Although our
efforts, first and foremost, must be
directed toward helping the victims
of the present calamity, our collec-
tive minds must turn to the preven-
tion of an equally bleak future.

JOINT STUDENT STATEMENT

n light of yesterday's
tragedy, we stand united in
condemnation of these
heinous attacks. Together, we
must grieve and ultimately
overcome. This crime forces us
to contemplate every held
belief about ourselves, our
community, our nation, and
our world.
This attack could make our
world appear dark and dismal,
or could be an opportunity for
cohesion and growth. It is vital
that we stand together as a
united community, held
together by the bonds of
humanity, love, and compas-
sion.
By virtue of the community
in which we are a part, the
value of diversity has been
deeply embedded within all of
us. The University of Michigan
is unique, special, and a place
which we are proud to call our

home, as a result of this
diversity, but also tolerance.
This tolerance has never been
more crucial than now. The
microcosm that we call our
home can serve as an
international example of
diversity, tolerance, and peace.
It is in our hands.

makes an enormous difference on
kids' opportunities," she said in
an interview after the event. "As
Arne said, this is the civil rights
issue of our time, and I really
think he's right about that."
The panel, also including
School of Education Profs. David
Cohen, Annemarie Palincsar and
Rob Sellers and Associate Profs.
Peter Bahr, Bob Bain, focused on
a variety of issues in the realm
of education reform. The pan-
elists discussed the challenges

of working with aging teachers
wary of new federal standards,
how to address the needs of
under-performing schools and
the need to increase the pres-
ence of minority teachers in
classrooms.
The panel also highlighted the
need to prepare a new generation
of teachers for the challenges
of teaching in low-performing
schools in diverse communities.
Duncan, in particular, stressed
the need of acclimating a new
crop of teachers to challenges in
today's classrooms.
"We have a new generation of
teachers who are going to come

in and fill about a million jobs of
teachers about to retire, and we
have to do a much better job of
preparing them to be successful
from day one," Duncan said.
Peter Cunningham, assistant
secretary for communications
and outreach at the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education, also stressed
in an interview with the Daily
that improvements in education
start with preparing teachers.
"This is a region of the coun-
try that has struggled some but
also has tremendous potential,
and a lot of that potential is in
our classrooms," Cunningham
said. "We think that we need to

do a better job of training teach-
ers, and that really falls on the
colleges and universities around
the country that have schools
of education to step up and do a
better job preparing teachers to
teach in classrooms."
He continued: "We want to
make sure that our young people
reach their full potential and
have every opportunity to suc-
ceed."
The panelists also discussed
the role ofeducationprograms in
ensuring new teachers' success
in the classroom. The panelists
stressed that classroom experi-
ence alone - through programs

such as Teach for America -
doesn't always give teachers the
complete skill set they need.
In an interview with the Daily
after the event, Ball highlighted
the large number of University
graduates who participate in the
Teach for America program. In
2010, the University sent the sec-
ond-most number of graduates
into the teaching corps with 79
participants, according to Teach
for America data. However, Ball
said it would be beneficial for
these students to have formal
teacher training before starting
in the classroom.
"The University of Michi-

gan has an amazing number of
undergraduates who are very in
touch with improving education,
and they're so socially commit-
ted," Ball said. "But one of the
things I would like to invite more
undergraduates to learn about is
what it would mean to be skillful
enough to work in an urban com-
munity well, even if it's just for a
couple of years.
"(The University has) sent a
ton of people to Teach for Amer-
ica, and an alternative would
be to come here (to the School
of Education) and become very
skilled so that you're really ready
to work in those communities."


GUPTA
From Page 1A
energetic pace and greeted a fel-
low Wolverine he'd never met
before like an old friend.
He welcomed me in his cor-
ner office overlooking Centen-
nial Olympic Park, where giant
steel torches remind tourists that
Atlanta hosted the 1996 Summer
Olympics. Though it was the mid-
dle of June, grey clouds spanned
the sky and threatened rain. At
first, Gupta's mood reflected the
odd summer weather as he told me
about the segment he just finished
about his longtime friend who
was losing a battle with life. But
as the subject turned to Michigan
and the days he spent as a resident
advisor in West Quad, the smile
that got him named one of Peo-
ple's "Sexiest Men Alive" made an
appearance.
It's also that smile that greets
American Morningviewers at 7:30
a.m. to warn of the health risks of
cell phones or announce ground-
breaking medical discoveries like
the cause of Lou Gerhig's disease.
It's the smile that greets patients
with life-threatening tumors to
let them know they're going to be
OK. And it's the smile that ignited
after Michigan football games,
when the Wolverines creamed
Ohio State and Ann Arbor erupted
in celebration.
And it's that smile Gupta wore
as he proudly talked of his college
days: "I was pretty true blue. It
would have taken a lot to get me
not to go to Michigan."
Gupta attended the University
of Michigan starting in 1986. He
remained there the next seven
years as part of Inteflex - a now
defunct program that combined
pre-med and medical school and
accepted students straight out of
high school. While Gupta applied
to several universities, he grew up
watching Michigan sports with
his dad, an alum, and fell in love
with Ann Arbor at an early age.
"I was pretty confident I want-
ed to go there when I was in grade
school," he said.
At the University, he had men-
tors like Karin Muraszko, current
chair of the Department of Neu-
rosurgery, neurosurgeon Greg
Thompson and Julian Hoff, the
chair of the neurosurgery depart-
ment at the time, who Gupta con-
sidered not only a role model, but a
father figure.
It was these surgeons, and

many others, who trained the
man Forbes would name one of
"the most influential celebrities"
in 2011.
As a teen, Gupta suffered a
significant head injury that was
treated at the University Hospital.
People mistakenly assume that
sparked his decision to enter a
career in neurosurgery.
But Gupta originally wanted to
be a pediatrician. That changed
when his grandfather had a stroke
during his third year in Medical
School. Gupta came to know his
grandfather's neurosurgeons who
took time to answer questions the
curious student posed about their
field.
"I thought the idea that you're
working on a part of the body that
is constantly changing in terms
of what we know about it would
make it a very-dynamic field, that
every operation was different in
some way - I thought that was
exciting," Gupta said.
Fast forward to today, and
Gupta suits up in scrubs at Grady
Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, but
not as the full-time neurosurgeon
he thought he would be. On a pie
chart of his career, the circle is
split half medicine and half media.
So how did a neurosurgeon
come to win an Emmy for Out-
standing Feature Story, a Health
Communications Achievement
Award from the American Medi-
cal Association and title of "Jour-
nalist of the Year?" You could say it
was all about timing - and meet-
ing the right people.
His journalism career kicked
off at The Michigan Daily where
he wrote opinion pieces about
public health policies. After grad-
uation, Gupta continued to write
on the subject for local newspa-
pers and small magazines. He also
collaborated with other writers
on a series of 14 articles on health
policy for The Economist. In 1997,
he worked in Washington D.C. as
a White House Fellow and wrote
health care speeches for then First
Lady Hillary Clinton.
Gupta described the experience
as "quite daunting," but can now
laugh about the times he present-
ed speeches to Clinton after sleep-
less nights filled with writing,
checking grammar and checking
it again.
"She would sit there reading it
with you, and you would be there
reading her face - does she like

it, does she hate it, is she going to
yell at me?" said Gupta, only half
joking.
While trying to win approval
from the First Lady, Gupta met
CNN chair and CEO Tom John-
son, who was trying to start a
medical unit at CNN. This was the
late 90s, when newspapers and
magazines covered health news
well, but television didn't, Gupta
explained. Johnson wanted to
change that by hiring Gupta.
"I had really no idea frankly
what he was talking about or
how I would help because I didn't
understand it," Gupta said.
So he turned the offer down.
In2001, Gupta ran into Johnson
again. Johnson gave him a tour of
the CNN newsroom that Gupta
saw as a "really inspiring place
filled with a lot of curious people."
His own curious nature won
him over, and Gupta accepted the
job,thinkinghe would coverhealth
policy. Six weeks later two planes
struck the World Trade Center.
Gupta was called to the scene
where he reported from New York
and later led breakingnews on the
dangers of anthrax.
He then covered the War in
Iraq. Haiti earthquake. Pakistan
floods. Japan tsunami. Somalia
famine.
"I evolved into this global
health reporter as a result of what
was happening in the world at the
time," Gupta explained.
CNN's senior medical cor-
respondent Elizabeth Cohen
described Gupta's reporting amid
war zones and natural disasters as
"nothingshort of outstanding."
"He's fearless, yet tells people's
stories so tenderly," Cohen wrote
in an e-mail interview. "He gets
right to the heart of what's hap-
pening in that region."
With each deadly disaster,
Gupta redefined health coverage
and set the standard for medical
reporting - mostly because no
doctor had done it before.
"There was no sort of rule book
for this ... there was no sort of prac-
ticing surgeon who was on a 24
hour news network," Gupta said.
Somehow, the neurosurgeon-
journalisthybrid makes it all work.
In the mornings and afternoons
he's on air. Every Thursday he sees
patients. Every Monday he's in the
operating room - regardless of
breaking news.
Instead of abandoning a patient
when the earthquake and tsunami
struck Japan in March, Gupta
took a flight on a Tuesday.

"No one is going to die frankly
if I'm not there 24 hours earlier,"
he said. "Everyone (at CNN) sort
of gets that."
Dr. Dan Barrow, chair of the
department of neurosurgery at
Emory University Hospital in
Atlanta, hired Gupta for a part-
time position at Grady Memorial
Hospital after the chair of CNN
called him up one day and asked
for a favor - to hire a man who
wouldn't accept a CNN job if it
meant giving up medicine.
Barrow had met Gupta when
he was a White House Fellow, and
the two kept in touch throughout
the years. When Barrow heard it
was Gupta he was asked to hire, he
didn't have to think twice.
Sitting in his office at 8 a.m. one
Friday in July, clad in greenish-
grey scrubs, Barrow explained
how his colleague has a "remark-
able ability to step out of the CNN
Dr. Gupta and step into the role
as the Emory physician Dr. Gupta
very readily."
"(He can) turn the switch and go
frombeing ahardcore investigative
reporter asking tough questions of
people, to being avery compassion-
ate physician," Barrow said.
Barrow also joked that Gupta
has secretly figured out a way to
not have to sleep.
Gupta is one of two neurosur-
geons at Grady, a hospital which
covers the cost of patients from
Fulton and DeKalb counties in
Georgia who don't have the means
to pay for medical care. Because he
sees drop-in and trauma patients in
a clinic setting, Gupta isn't obligat-
ed to see patients regularlylike the
20 neurosurgeons at Emory Hos-
pital. Barrow has also let him slide
on taking emergency calls at night
since he has to be on air before 8
a.m. for America Morning.
"We've made accommodations
for him very willingly because he
is an asset to the department in
many many ways," Barrow said.
Gupta mostly attends to injuries
and accidents, and he's never short
of patients.
"I get a lot of referrals because
people are like, 'I want to see that
guy. I see him on TV,' which is
kind of silly," Gupta said. "I say,
you know, 'just because I'm on TV,
doesn't make me good.' I mean, I
think I'm good, but it's not because
I'm on TV."
Muraszko, one of Gupta's men-
tors from the University Hospital,

says she's proud of what Gupta has
done with his career but thinks
it's tough for him to "live in two
worlds."
"He's in a very unique set of
circumstances in that he ... tries
to make sure that he stays valid
as a neurosurgeon and not just be
totally a health science reporter,"
she said.
Atthisstageinhiscareer, Gupta
has made neurosurgery a priority.
It's a decision that became evident
when he turned down President
Barack Obama's offer in 2009 to
be the U.S. Surgeon General.
While sitting on a couch next to
the upper body of a human skel-
eton, Gupta confidently explained
that he made the right decision.
"Everybody who knows me knows
I don't live in the world of regrets
or second guessing," he said.
If he had taken the job at age 39,
he would have had to give up prac-
ticing medicine during the four-
year term.
"It's a bit ironic that the surgeon
general can't practice surgery," he
admitted.
Barrow was duck hunting with
his father at 6 a.m. during the
Thanksgiving holiday when his
cell phone rang, and Gupta's name
flashed on the screen. Barrow
thought there was an emergency,
but was pleasantly surprised when
Gupta confidentially told him
about his nomination and sought
advice on what to do.
"I was very torn because obvi-
ously I thought he would do a
great job... on the other hand, I
selfishly didn't wanthim to leave,"
Barrow said.
As the news started to spread,
Barrow said he was amazed by the
number of people and politicians
who criticized Gupta as a can-
didate. He pointed to Rep. John
Conyers (D-Mich.) specifically
who wrote aletter to fellow House
Democrats, urging them to oppose
Obama's nomination.
"Clearly, it is not in the best
interests of the nation to have
someone like this who lacks the
requisite experience needed to
oversee the federal agency that
provides crucial health care assis-
tance to some of the poorest and
most underserved communities in
America," Conyers wrote.
Even today, Barrow has trouble
bottling his anger over the accusa-
tion. "His comment that this guy
'isn't really a doctor' troubled me
and made me realize that people
probably just think that Sanjay
spends all of his time at CNN,"

Barrow said.
Barrow told one reporter who
called him for a quote that "Mr.
Conyers ought to do his homework
before he makes comments like
that" and that "Sanjay not only is

happens to practice in an indigent
care 1,000 bedhospital."
"He takes care of people that
have all the issues and the prob-
lems that our next president is
going to have to face ... If anybody
is in a position to understand what
those needs areit's SanjayGupta,"
said Barrow, waving his arms
behind his rich wooden desk.
"This is what he does everyday of
his life, he's not working in some
country club hospital."
Ultimately, Gupta came to a
decision. By the time the term
ended, he would be too removed
from the evolving field of neuro-
surgery to step back in the oper-
ating room. Plus, he had a wife
- who he met at Palio on Main
Street where she waitressed -two
young daughters and one more on
the way at the time. ,
At age 41, Gupta recognizes he's
still young, and there will be more
chances to work in public service
in the future.
For now, his career and fam-
ily are all that matter. And when
there's time, the former Men's
Glee Club member likes to visit a
"special place" he calls Ann Arbor.
In his previous visits, he gave the
2009 Medical School commence-
ment address and conducted the
last interview with euthanasia
activist Dr. Jack Kevorkian before
he died in June.
His next return isn't work-
related. The self-proclaimed "true
blue" Wolverine made sure to
buy tickets months in advance to
the first ever football night game
against Notre Dame.
As he sat in his CNN office
- as pristine as an OR -Gupta
explained that when people look
back on their life, they think of
moments. If they're asked what
happened in 2009, they may think
of one moment from that year. The
point, he said, is when you're hav-
ing a moment, make it count.
"Make it something that you
will talk about 15, 20 years from
now," he said. "I'm reminded of
that because I'm really excited
about going to this football game.
I think it's going to be one of those
moments I will remember from
2011. That moment. Memorable
moments. That's how you look at
your life."

sources and men's sexual practices
and whether there were shortcom-
ings in the sex education system
that could lead to sexual health
problems later in life.
The most significant part of the
trip, he said, was forming relation-
ships despite the language barrier.
"I would say, probably the big-
gest (take away) would be the uni-
versality of a smile," he said. "I
don't know - there's something
about it. People, when they travel,
usually note that people are not as
engaging, and I stuck out like a sore
thumb in India, and I did get a lot of
stares, but those occasional smiles
did make a huge difference."
While LSA junior Gallal Obeid

did a little traveling around Europe
this summer, he spent most of his
time working at the Acole Poly-
technique Federale de Lausanne in
Switzerland, where he researched
Parkinson's disease.
"I've never learned so much in
so little time," Obeid said. "I really
wished I could stay longer."
Like Hakim, Obeid said one
of the main benefits of his time
abroad was learning about a dif-
ferent culture first hand. And he
said he plans to return to Switzer-
land next summer to continue his
research.
"I was really worried about the
cultural boundaries and being
alone," he said. "But I learned that
wherever you go, if the people there
are the ones that make the trip, the
people make the journey and you
really learn from them. They really

made the experience worth it."
LSA junior Mel Hebeisen's trav-
els this summer involved a trip to
Indonesia through the Univer-
sity's Global Intercultural Experi-
ence for Undergraduates program.
Hebeisen's group researched the
preservation of traditional Indo-
nesian culture, which she said is
being eroded by tourism.
Hebeisen said she chose the
program because she wanted to be
immersed in an unfamiliar culture
while experiencing the comfort
and safety of traveling with Uni-
versity students.
"I chose Indonesia because I
knew I'd probably never have a
chance to go to Southeast Asia, and
it was a culture that I really wasn't
familiar with at all," she said.
Hebeisen added that her favor-
ite part of the journey was living

with her homestay family because
her experiences during that time
allowed her to truly learn about life
in Indonesia.
"You got to see how a family
functions, and you got really close
to the parents and the siblings and
you could kind of tell them about
what the U.S. was like and they
would tell you what their life was
like ... which was really awesome,"
she said.
Hebeisen added that along with
the knowledge about Indonesian
NGOs and their efforts to preserve
traditional culture, her time abroad
instilled in her two new ideas: the
need to reduce stress in her life and
to learn more about people.
"We're so scheduled and every-
thing is so intense and competi-
tive, and it made me kind of step
back and realize how stressful my

life is and how I can change that,"
she said. "I learned how important
it is to get to know people around
you and how important it is to ask
people questions about their life
and really not just talk about sur-
face things - talk about things that
are important to people - because
then you really get to know who
they are."
LSA junior Alexander Lud-
wig also spent time this summer
engaging in community outreach.
Ludwig spent two weeks working
with the Honduras Medical Bri-
gade, which organized a medical
mission trip.
During the first week, partici-
pants went to a preschool, helped
open a free clinic and distributed
health and hygiene samples to
patients. The second week was
spent providing basic necessities

for local homes.
"We helped them build a bath-
room, a water storage system, a
stove, and then we also cemented
their floors so that they wouldn't
get a deadly virus that people get in
Honduras from walking barefoot
on the ground," Ludwig said.
Not only did the trip increase
Ludwig's determination to go into
the medical field, but it also forced
him to reconsider his priorities.
"The biggest life lesson I learned
was to really appreciate the loved
ones that you have, because the
people of Honduras only really had
their loved ones. They didn't have
any materialistic items like we do,"
he said. "They just have the love
of each other, and here in America
we have been clouded by material
things, and we sometimes forget
about those closest to us."

'M' readies for first night game at Big House

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
wouldn't ever say he's scared
of the dark, but he's not a fan of
nighttime.
Not for football games, at
least.
"I do like twelve-o'clock
games," Hoke said.
"But I have no say, which is
okay too."
The Wolverines' "Under the
Lights" tilt with Notre Dame on
Saturday night may be the first
night game in Michigan Stadium
history, but the concept is old hat
for Hoke.
In 2008, Hoke's final season at
Ball State, the Cardinals' sched-
ule featured seven night games.
That left just seven more games
to be played during the daytime.
Michigan, it's safe to say, has a
different policy on night games.
Last weekend's matchup with
Western Michigan bled into the
early evening, but Hoke said his
team hasn't really had a late-
night practice in preparation for
Saturday's game.
During the Brady Hoke Radio
Show on Wednesday, Hoke
admitted that in hindsight he
should have held a few eve-
ning practices. But he said it's
more about keeping the team on
schedule.

"(I) never really have (prac- 18 passes, then-Michigan coach

Breakdown: Hype won't be enough against Notre Dame

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
Saturday has turned from a
game into an event. The first
night game in Michigan Sta-
dium, the legacy jerseys, the
honoring of Desmond Howard
and the appearance of ESPN's
College GameDay have all taken
away from the fact that it's still
just a football game.
Despite the buildup and the
outside distractions, the match-
ups on the field may be the most
intriguing part. Here's our look
at them.
Michigan pass offense vs.
Notre Dame pass defense
Without many opportunities
against Western Michigan, it's
tough to judge junior quarter-
back Denard Robinson's prog-

ress as a passer this season. He
threw just 13 times, and while he
completed nine, he was never in
a position where he had to make
a throw.
That will change against
Notre Dame. Fighting Irish safe-
ty Harrison Smith is as good as
they come. After a 91-tackle sea-
son a year ago, he tallied six more
in Notre Dame's loss to South
Florida.
Smith is joined by fellow
returning starters Zeke Motta
and Gary Gray at safety and cor-
nerback, respectively. The unit
held the Bulls to only 128 yards
through the air last Saturday and
have the talent to match up with
the Wolverines' wide receiv-
ers, mainly redshirt junior Roy
Roundtree and fifth-year senior
Junior Hemingway.
Aside from a Hemingway post

route, the receivers followed
their quarterback with an aver-
age if not boring day last week.
The look of the passing game is
still a mystery.
It could be waiting to break
out, but Notre Dame's secondary
is a sure thing.
Edge: Notre Dame
Michigan rush offense vs.
Notre Dame rush defense
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
wanted to bring the power rush
game back to Michigan. He did
it last Saturday, spending two
quarters running for minimal
gains before breaking it open
with two long runs in the third
quarter.
The Wolverines finished the
day with 190 yards in slightly less
than three quarters. Redshirt
sophomore Fitzgerald Toussaint

had 80 yards, but 43 of them
came on one run.
As for Robinson, his 258-yard
performance on the ground last
year against Notre Dame won't
happen again. The new offense,
to some extent, has bottled up his
rushing ability, and the Fighting
Irish are certainly aware of what
he's capable of this time.
All-America candidate and
Notre Dame linebacker Manti
Te'o will lead the charge against
him. He will get help from fellow
linebacker Darius Fleming.
But if Al Borges opens up Rob-
inson and the Wolverine linemen
can get to the second level like
they did last year, every Michi-
gan fan knows what Robinson
can do.
Throw in the return of red-
shirt junior left guard Ricky
Barnum from suspension and a

Notre Dame defensive line that
lacks depth, and the Wolverines
hold a slight advantage.
Edge: Michigan
Notre Dame pass offense vs.
Michigan pass defense
Whether fifth-year senior
cornerback Troy Woolfolk is
healthy, Michigan has no one
who can cover Fighting Irish
wide receiver Michael Floyd.
After injury and legal trouble,
Floyd is back on the field and
back to torching secondaries -
no matter who throws him the
ball.
The last time he was at Michi-
gan Stadium he had 131 yards
and a touchdown. Last week, he
hauled in 12 catches for154yards
and two touchdowns. But there's
not much behind Floyd.
Theo Riddick is serviceable
and the Fighting Irish are
still breaking in their new
starter at tight end Tyler Eif-
ert.
If the Wolverine corner-
backs, mainly redshirt junior
J.T. Floyd and sophomore
Courtney Avery, can avoid
single coverage against Rid-
dick, Michigan has a shot to
win the battle.
Quarterback Tommy
Rees isn't going to make
it easy though. While he's
entrenched in a quarter-
back controversy, he clearly
outplayed his counterpart
Dayne Crist last week, going
24-of-32 and throwing two
touchdowns, although he
threw two interceptions as
well.
A good performance
against Michigan could
secure him the job. He'll be
ready. The only question is if
he'll be able to pick up on the
blitzes that Michigan defen-
sive coordinator Greg Matti-
son calls so well.
Edge: Notre Dame
Notre Dame rush offense
vs. Michigan rush defense
Both Hoke and Matti-
son were disappointed with
Michigan's defensive line
and linebacker play against
Western Michigan.
Although the Fighting
Irish lost just one starter
from last year's team, the
unit was 92nd in rushing
yards per game last season.
Running back Cierre Wood
is a returning starter and is
coming off a 110-yard perfor-
mance.
With Hoke, Mattison and
defensive line coach Jerry
Montgomery getting on the
line all week in practice,
captain and senior defensive
tackle Mike Martin will have
his unit ready to take on a
weak run-blocking offensive
line.

The Wolverine linebackers
have been hearing the criticism
as well (even with fifth-year
senior Brandon Herron on pace
for 24 defensive touchdowns
this season). Although redshirt
sophomore Cam Gordon's status
is still uncertain due to a back
injury that sidelined him in the
Western Michigan game, the
linebacking corps should play
better than they did last week.
Expect redshirt junior middle
linebacker Kenny Demens to be
a little more excited than every-
oneelse. He'll be playing against 4
his former high school teammate
Jonas Gray, Notre Dame's back-
up running back.
Edge: Michigan
Special teams
Michigan didn't attempt a i
field goal last Saturday and had
one extra point attempt blocked.
Freshman Matt Wile, thrust into
punting duties after sophomore
Will Hagerup was suspended
for the first four games this sea-
son, had just two punts against
Western Michigan, averaging 41
yards.
While the relatively low work-
load is what Hoke wants, there's
no proof that Michigan has
improved its dreadful kicking
game.
Adding to the woes, the Wol-
verines' kick-off coverage was a
problem all game as the Broncos
averaged more than 31 yards for
return. Notre Dame returns both
their kicker, David Ruffer, and 4
punter Ben Turk.
After going 18-for-19 last sea-
son Ruffer missed a 30-yard
field goal last week, the only one
he attempted. While neither is
likely to contend for any nation-
al awards, when facing Michi-
gan having a warm body in the
spot leads to an edge almost by
default.
Edge: Notre Dame
Intangibles
Playing under the lights and
in front of what is expected to
be the largest crowd in Michigan
history favors the home team.
Yet, it all may just be a distraction
that the Wolverine players can't
get away from. With the game
being Hoke's first test and first
rivalry game, the team will be
ready. Considering the circum-
stances, Hoke may have to calm
them down.
While Notre Dame doesn't
have the big crowd behind it or
a brand new coach to play for, it
needs this game more. Fighting
Irish coach Brian Kelly's sec-
ond season was supposed to be a
step forward. A loss to Michigan
pushes Notre Dame to 0-2 and
Kelly's seat gets a bit hot.

there's sure to
be something
for every buyer's taste.
But these buyers aren't choos-
ing between pickups and sedans
- they're sizing up hardcovers
and paperbacks.
The annual Kerrytown Book-
Fest celebrates the often over-
looked yet thriving literary
community nestled within the
heart of the Great Lakes State.
The celebration is famous for its
focus on Michigan's wealth of
local talent as well as its inclu-
sion of techniques from every
stage in the book-making pro-
cess.
"It's not just about authors
and publishers," said Gene Allo-
way, BookFest Board President
and owner of local bookstore
Motte & Bailey. "We include

papermakers, book artists, bind-
ers, printers, letterpress artists,
poster makers - you name it. It's
having all of those people all in
one spot which makes us pretty
unique."
More than just a place to
buy and sell books, the festival
is entertainingly educational.
Exhibits and demonstrations
allow attendees a rare glimpse
into the conceptual and tangible
halves of the creative process
behind books and other print
items.
"We have writer talks, there
are craftspeople working, there
are activities for children, there
are authors signing their books
and there's usually a storyteller,"
Alloway said. "Used and new
booksellers and some publish-
ers do have stuff to buy, but you
could go for the whole day with-
out spending any money."
This year's festival theme,
"Michigan Voices," puts aspecial
emphasis on creative minds from
the surrounding region. Speak-
ers include Robin Agnew, owner
of Aunt Agatha's mystery book-
shop, Caldecott Award-winning
children's authors Erin and Phil-
ip Stead and NPR reporter Kate
Davidson, along with nearly 50
additional guests ranging from
authors and producers to illus-
trators and photographers.
The theme also shines a much-
deserved spotlighton localbook-
based businesses. Despite the
fact that several famous printers
and publishers live in the area,
most people are unaware of the
sheer size of Michigan's contri-
bution to the literary world.
"One of the long traditions in

our area is printing," Alloway
said. "For example, the best-
selling autobiography of Mark
Twain that came out was print-
ed by Thomson Shore in Dexter,
Michigan, and they just got an
order to print their 175,000th
copy. There's still more books
physically made between the
suburbs of Detroit and Manches-
ter than anywhere else in the
world."
The Kerrytown BookFest
has become a local tradition,
now celebrating its ninth year.
Although people of all ages are
encouraged to attend, Alloway
said that the festival planners
would enjoy seeing more Univer-
sity students in its crowds.
"One - of the issues we get
with University students is that
everything west of Division
Street seems to be terra incog-
nito," Alloway said. "As we grow
we're trying to reach out. It's
hard right now because every-
one's moving in and getting
settled."
The event's swelling atten-
dance continues to fuel public
interest in the art of the written
word. Ultimately, it's the all-in-
one package that Michigan's lit-
erary community provides that
makes its part in the industry -
and the festival - such a success.
"We're lucky to have a lot of
great authors, but we also enjoy
showing all of the steps and
the people that get a book from
author to reader," Alloway said.
"You don't have to go to New
York City to find a printer, to find
an agent, to find a publisher, to
find a bookstore. That's one of
the things that makes us great."

Before becoming a student at
the University three years ago,
I had lived in Cincinnati for my
entire life. Even more than that,
my parents had grown up in "The

were also raised there. Need-
less to say, I had been deeply

culture for 18 years - the bloody
battle between chili-serving fast

borhood's farm and the glorious
oeaven-on-earth deliciousness
that is Graeter's ice cream. I had
lived and breathed Cincinnati
and, though I loved my home-
town, I was ready for a change
after high school. So I was sur-
prised when I decided to attend
the University; after all, it was
located only one midwestern
state north from Ohio. How dif-
ferent could Michigan really be?

IV 1 SKITS FOR SCHOOL
The art o orientation


"No worries, guys. I just killed Voldemort."
Guns and gals do
not a movie make

By DAVID TAO
DailyFilmEditor
Legendary French filmmaker Jean-
Luc Godard once said, "All you need for
a movie is a girl and
a gun." Twenty years
later, it seems his
fellow Frenchmen, Colombiana
director Olivier Mega-
ton ("Transporter At Quality16
3") and producer Luc and Rave
Besson ("From ParisT
with Love"), have ar
taken those words a
little too closely to heart. Their latest
film, "Colombiana," has a girl who has
a bunch of guns. What it lacks however,
are all the things Godard forgot to men-
tion - originality, believable dialogue
and consistency.
Our heroine, Cataleya (Zoe Saldana,
"Avatar"), had her parents violently
murdered in front of her at a young age,
and so she belongs to that overused
class of stock character. Since she's in
an action movie, this means she'll grow
up to be a trained killer lusting after
revenge. And sure enough, she hops off
to Chicago to take murder classes with
her uncle Emilio (Cliff Curtis, "Live
Free or Die Hard"). Thd next time we
see her, she's a fully grown hit woman,
executing contract killings in a precise,
impeccably planned fashion and sign-
ing victims with her trademark orchid.
There're a few B-movie flaws right off
the bat. All the guys she turns into corps-
es happen to be scumbags who totally
deserve it because they had something
to do with killing her parents or harm-
ing a lot of people, so we can feel good
about cheering as Cataleya slaughters
them. Her eye-catching, guilty-pleasure
work clothes, which include hooker
outfits and formfitting sweat suits, hint
at some deep-seated daddy issues but
are nevertheless fun to stare at. And
there are thy French actors brought in,
ostensibly on a budget, to play Ameri-
cans - leading to a lot of half-European,
half-almost-Anierican accents that grate
annoyingly on the ears.
If that were all, it'd still be a fairly
entertainingmovie. Traditionally, mov-
ies from guys like Megaton and Besson
are cheap and gritty, hackneyed and
imitative. But, at the same time, their
combined filmography, which includes

part of "The Transporter" franchise,
is for the most part honest and enter-
taining. Audiences know exactly what
they're getting - sex, violence, explo-
sions, fights - and what they're not get-
ting - subtlety, realism and emotional
involvement.
"Colombiana," however, is also tone
deaf and schizophrenic. One minute,
it's got a callous, unintentionally funny
disregard for human life, imitating but
never quite achieving the crazy energy
that makes Jason Statham movies so
enjoyable. Emilio tries to teach a young
Cataleya the importance of a genuine
school education by killing a random
driver in broad daylight with an obnox-
iously large revolver. One of Cataleya's
targets winds up gruesomely fed to his
own pet sharks.
Colombiana' is a
roller-coaster ride
of action ... but
don't bother riding.
And then all of a sudden the movie
degenerates into an overly sensitive
sob-fest. Emilio, who we've now estab-
lished as some sort of lunatic (Curtis's
Al Pacino impression certainly helps),
is suddenly giving long archetypal
speeches about how his son was mur-
dered and all the murder and killing
he did in return still couldn't bring his
kid back to life. Cataleya cries rivers
over her dead parents. She keeps cry-
ing because her boyfriend/booty call,
who doesn't even know her real name,
wants to try a serious relationship, and
that obviously won't work because she
kills people for a living.
A little emotional investment is a
good thing in a movie, but it only works
when you genuinely care about the -
characters, whose dialogue isn't cloned
from every other gangster/crime movie
ever made. And in "Colombiana,"
Megaton's attempts at adding some
depth to his movie backfire tremen-
dously, turning a perfectly serviceable
low-budget thriller into a disorganized,
atonal mess.

UMETC adds solace
and laughter to the
freshman experience
By EMMA GASE
Daily Music Editor
Oh, the anxieties of freshman year.
From the sometimes-disastrous room-
mate match-ups to the arbitrary dorm
placement (anyone ever heard of Fletch-
er?) or the anonymity of beinga measly
one of 500 in of your first lecture, the
trials that freshmen in college have to
stumble through these days (and not
always drunkenly, either) could stress
out even the most level-headed of teens.
To a clueless and sheltered 18-year-
old, the transition from an insular high
school environment to the enigmatic
utopia that is the University might come
as a shock. It isn't always a breeze learn-
ing to live sans parents in a bustling
campus of over 25,000 of your peers
where (at least during the first couple of
weeks) your best friend is a tie between
MoJo's Panini maker and C-Tools.
But fear not young'uns, for the Uni-
versity of Michigan Educational The-
atre Company has been here for the past
six years to help freshmen avoid these
typicalbumps in the road. UMETC aims
to tackle a wide range of qualms that
permeate the minds of young under-
classmen.
Remember being bussed to North
Campus during freshman orientation?
It wasn't just to marvel at the beauti-
ful foliage, but to watch the UMETC
perform a series of comedic, SNL-like
sketches that - in a hilarious and edu-
cational way - address the situations
that freshmen are going to be exposed
to upon their arrival at the University.
Through these skits, students learn not
only the practical ways to navigate UHS,
the libraries and the dorms, but also
about the personal strains of college,
like maintaining relationships with
your friends from high school, meeting
new people and being homesick.
It's certainly no easy feat to command
the attention of an entire freshman class
while trying to educate them - and no
less, making them laugh while learn-
ting logistical mumbo-jumbo about the
bureaucracy of a large institution like
the University.
"We want it to be a fun and creative
way to present some of the content that
might have otherwise been in a folder

UMETC is a professional theater company that employs students.

or a lecture format or in a PowerPoint,"
said UMETC Education Director Cal-
lie McKee. "The goal is to get students
acquainted with the resources on cam-
pus, without putting them to sleep."
UMETC isn't just an extracurricu-
lar for students in the theatre depart-
ment like Basement Arts or MUSKET.
UMETC does introduce the frosh new-
bies to programs in the arts at Michigan,
but most of its members are drawn from
LS&A, the School of Engineering and
the Residential College. It's an opportu-
nity for students who maynot studythe-
ater but are still passionate about it, and
for those who are especially passionate
about the University.
"We look for people who are really
geeked about going to Michigan, and are
also fantastic performers," McKee said.
"It's a group of people that are ridicu-
lously talented and also want to give
back to the University."
"Givingback tothe University" reach-
es far beyond just freshman orientation.
Beside performing for the internation-
al and transfer students' orientation,
UMETC also performs throughout the
year in engineering classrooms, using
its sketch comedy to give students an
idea of how to successfully work in
diverse teams with their peers. Easing
students' minds is part of what makes
endless rehearsals and year-round per-
formances worth it for the members of
UMETC.

"We get really good feedback, stu-
dents saying stuff like, 'I didn't know, I
feel so much more welcome, now I can
be OK,"' McKee said.
What's more is that UMETC isn't
just a group of volunteers. Not only did
it perform over 34 times this summer
alone, but it also is technically a profes-
sional theater group - meaning it's a
paid job.
"A lot of people think that we just
throw it together ... but this is my full-
time job. I have the best job on campus,"
said McKee.
Though some of the lines in the skits
change from night to night, McKee
helps the students write agenerally per-
manent script. Many of the sketches are
developed through improvised games
played during rehearsal. These prac-
tices, when the actors let loose, are part
of the reason McKee feels so strongly
about her job because at the heart of it
all, the skits don't merely help clueless
freshmen get the lay of the land. The
entire process serves as an outlet for the
members to truly let loose and be silly.
"When else do we get permission
to just be ridiculous? It's like a mental
health break," McKee said. "We use all
of that ridiculousness to put something
together that's helping people..
"We're always trying to get back to
our eight-year-old roots, and be those
awesome people who played and just got
ridiculous."

world-class collection. These Michigan
gems were no longer just vague concep-
tions I associated with the state - they
were real, tangible places that I had
been to, convected with and became a
part of.
This summer made me think about
what - or where - exactly, is "home."
During this period of transition in my
life, is home Cincinnati, where my fam-
ily and childhood memories are based?
Is it in Michigan, where I came into my
own and currently spend most of my
time? Or have I yet to find the place that

I will ultimately call home? While each
individual will have a different answer
to this question, I like to think (along the
lines of the adage) that home is where
the heart is. Right now, my heart is split
between Ohio and Michigan, and those
are the places I consider as my home. I
don't think of "home" asa finite concept;
people can have many homes, geograph-
ical and otherwise.
And, while I can't technically consider
myself a Detroit native, like indie musi-
cian Sufjan Stevens, I can now under-
stand what the hell he's talking about on

I love the awkward pauses, the co-
workers ranging from uncomfortable to
obstinate to just plain awful and the con-
stant true-to-life tediousness. I love "The
Office." But it should have ended last sea-
son. It's had an outstanding seven-season
run, receiving multiple award nomina-
tions and earning several wins. It's one of
the signature comedy shows of our time.
But there is a point when a series
should naturally come to an end. Steve
Carell's decision to leave should have
been the logical conclusion of the show.
After seven seasons with Michael Scott
in the boss's seat, the series can't expect
to be the same without him.
I've got nothing against James Spader
("Boston Legal"), and I expect he'll do
an adequate job as Robert California,
the newest cast member. But he'll never
come close to Michael Scott, that's a
given. Michael was the heart of the show,
the blundering patriarch of the Scranton
branch family. Though "The Office" can
boast an exceptional ensemble cast, it
was Michael Scott's endearing foolish-
ness that made the series so successful in
the first place.
Granted, there have been a number
of lows in the series's history, even with
Carell on board. The series's success lies
in its ability to brilliantly express the

monotony of daily life in an office - the
trick is keeping the audience interested
while continually creating new wit and
humor. Season five fell into a bit of a
slump. Unfortunately, season six proved
more of the same, ultimately coming off
flat. It seemed "The Office" was on a per-
manent downward slope.
Season seven was a revelation, espe-
cially for longtime "Office" fans. The
send-off for Michael spawned some of
the best episodes yet (we'll forget about
Will Ferrell's completely lackluster guest
appearance). It seems knowing it was
the last season of Michael Scott shook up
the office and breathed new life into the
show.
The show
mustn't go on.
Yet there's simply a point where it
starts to get old. The ultimate success of
season seven arose from the uncertain
future - Michael leaving gave the show
a renewed focus. I miss the freshness of
previous seasons, especially the second
and third. Jim's (John Krasinski) pranks
on Dwight (Rainn Wilson), crazy Jan
Levenson (Melora Hardin), Michael's
utter lack of tact.

The original British version avoided
the slump by only airing 14 episodes. It's
one of the reasons the original was so
brilliant, exposing the tedium while still
bringing somethingnew to the table with
each episode. The American adaptation
just hasn't been able to remain as innova-
tive as it once was. True, the more recent
seasons have their high points, but it's
just not the same. I'd hate to watch the
series I've grown to love end up stuck in
a rut for its duration.
Though Carell's motivations for leav-
ing are questionable (considering the
success of "The Office" launched him
into A-list territory in the first place), his
departure still leaves the series without
its front-runner. And while the remain-
ing cast members are talented and
capable of continuing without Michael
Scott, it doesn't mean they should. The
series could have taken the opportunity
to bow out on a triumphant note, yet it
seems determined to forge ahead without
Carell.
And I'll be the first to admit, I'm prob-
ably still going to watch season eight. The
Michael Scott-less finale of season seven
was admittedly entertaining, though it
relied too heavily on the multitude of
guest stars. It's a toss up whether season
eight can maintain the quality that I've
come to expect from "The Office." Suffice
it to say, even if it succeeds, it won't ever
be the same.

BEYOND
OUR SHORES
International students strive to find
peace in a severed post 9/11 world.

BY BRIENNE PRUSAK

Like many children around
the world on Sept. 11, 2001,
11-year-old Wan Aisyah was
getting ready for school before
mayhem struck in lower Man-
hattan and Washington D.C.
But unlike many children whose lives
were changed that day because their par-
ents were the victims of the catastrophic
attack, Aisyah's life did not change much.
That is until he left his home country of
Malaysia to go to college in the United
Sates - at the University.
"September 11 didn't cause much stir in
my life until I left for the U.S. in 2008 to
study at the University," said Aisyah, an
LSA senior. "That was when I first realized
that my identity as a Muslim is strongly
linked to the September 11 event, although
I wasn't from the Middle East nor affiliated
with any political parties."
Aisyah is one of many international stu-
dents at the University who have felt the

ripple effects of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
Whether they've been questioned about
their religious identification, seen their
country divide because of people's beliefs
or faced challenges attaining jobs in the
U.S. because of their immigration status,
international students have - like many
people around the world - experienced the
effects of that day that changed not only
the U.S. but every country on the globe.
Aisyah said he has seen the assumptions
people make as a result of 9/11about people
who identify with the Islam religion.
"I feel like there's a bigger sense of
responsibility now as a Muslim to clear
up the misconceptions that the world has
towards Islam," he said. "There has never
been an issue of extremist activities among
Malaysian Muslims, but people tend to
label you negatively just because of the
Muslim label we wear."
Because of these misconceptions, Aisyah
has taken it upon himself to make students
on campus more aware of the injustice that
the closed-mindedness brings. The reper-
cussions of the 9/11 terrorist attacks have
also fed his drive for success.
"Just because of the simple misunder-
standings, feelings of hatred began to
arise between both sides - the Muslims
and the non-Muslims," Aisyah said. "9/11
had shaped my career goals in motivating
myself to become the bridge that help(s)
both sides of the party gain better under-
standing towards each other."
Aisyah has also found that many people
on campus are more curious than fearful of
his religious identity and have asked ques-
tions about his religious practices.
"But it was more of a genuine curiosity
rather than an attempt to offend me,"'he
said.
Unlike Aisyah, who didn't see many
changes in his home country following
9/11, Engineering sophomore Joe Kaew-
baidhoon said in the wake of 9/11, tensions
clearly arose between Arabs and non-Arabs

On 9/11, as Oates's former col-
leagues from the Patrol Borough
Brooklyn South rushed to down-
town Manhattan, he scrambled
to evacuate Ann Arbor City Hall
and identify and guard potential
terrorist targets in the local water
supply and infrastructure.
In a recent interview, Oates -
who has been the chief of police
for the city of Aurora, Colo. since
November 2005 - described that
morning as "chaotic."
"I had, seemingly to me at the

time, everyone turning to me and
asking, 'What do we do?' " Oates
said, adding that the 36 hours fol-
lowing the attacks werve "unlike
anything we had experienced."
That night, Oates and Ann Arbor
Mayor John Hieftje met with local
Muslim community leaders to plan
an event for the following day to
decry the backlash against Ann
Arbor's Muslim community. Oates
said the event was "the primary
reason why we had no subsequent
or significant events of backlash
against our Muslim citizens in
Ann Arbor in the days and months
afterward."
Oates later contacted his for-
mer command in New York to ask
about the status of two of his police
friends who responded to calls at
the World Trade Center and were
missing. They were finally located
two days later.
Though his two friends sur-
vived, Oates knew nine of the 23
NYPD officers who died on 9/11.
He admitted it was difficult to be
away from New York in the days
and months after the terrorist

attacks.
"For me personally, it was really
hard because by the time the tow-
ers went down, I knew to a certain-
ty that people I knew had died,"
Oates said. "And of course that
turned out to be absolutely true."

As the University community
grieved in the wake of the Sept. 11
attacks, then-University President
Lee Bollinger was stuck in New
York City trying to return to Ann
Arbor.
Bollinger, now the president
of Columbia University, and Ken
Fischer, then and current president
of the University of Michigan Musi-
cal Society, were in New York that
Tuesday to meet with representa-
tives from the Royal Shakespeare
Company about the relationship
between the company and the Uni-
versity of Michigan.
Because all flights were ground-
ed, Bollinger had to drive back to
Michigan, arrivingin Ann Arbor on
Sept.13.
University spokeswoman Julie
Peterson told The Michigan Daily at
the time: "He got a car, and he was
driving back last night. He's fine,
and he wasn't in Manhattan, so he
wasn'tcright in the middle ofthings."
After returning to campus, Bol-
linger, along with his wife Jean and
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieftje,
attended a Sept. 14 service at the
Islamic Center of Ann Arbor. They
went to show support for members
of the local Muslim community
since they might have been targets

of retaliation because of their reli-
gious identification.
"It is frightening and disturbing
to people who are subject to that
kind of intolerance," Bollinger told
the Daily in 2001.
The Sunday after the attacks,
the Bollingers also hosted an open
house at their South University
Avenue home to provide students
with a "home away from home,"
Jean Bollinger told the Daily at the
open house. Various campus musi-
cal groups performed, and small
groups of students spoke with the
Bollingers about the impact of the
attacks.
"There's a sense of family on
this campus,"Lee Bollinger told the
Daily at the time. He added that he
hoped the open house could start
to help the University community
move on.
"There was some sort of transi-
tion needed," Bollinger said at the
time. "However, I don't think nor-
mal life is possible right now and
won't be possible for a long time."
Bollinger, through a Columbia
University spokesman, declined
several recent requests from the
Daily for an interview for this
article.

University lecturer Jonathan
Marwil has taught a course on 9/11
every fall since 2007. And though
the students in every class experi-
enced that day in one wayor anoth-
er, Marwil has never once asked,
"Where were you when the towers
fell?"
That's because, as Marwil points
out, he's teaching a history course
- one that requires students to
detach themselves from their own
experiences in order to see the big-
ger picture.
"I'm not interested in turning
the class into 35 personal stories,"
Marwil said. "I want the students
to be, so to speak, historians - not
witnesses - of the event."
As Marwil was interviewed out-
side his classroom in Mason Hall
yesterday, his History 360 students
were watching a 2002 documenta-
ry called "9/11," a film composed of
first-person footage from that day.
It's films like these - along with
books, documents and guest speak-
ers - that constitute the course
curriculum.
After finishing the documen-

campus newspaper ... there were
no obvious answers," Gagnon
said. "It was a strange afternoon
- one in which we didn't have a
good playbook on what to do."
Many staff members were
engaged in passionate debates
regarding the content in the
paper for the next day, Gagnon
said, adding that an editorial
board meeting was particularly
heated.
"Everyone was fully engaged
in a wayI had never seen before,"
Gagnon said. "It's one of those
instances where you know you
have to say something, but you
don't know what it is that you
really have to say."
Newsweek reported on the
experiences of Gagnon and
other University students in a
November 2001 article titled
"Generation 9-11." Gagnon -
currently a senior editor at The
Atlantic - said it was because
of the experience of interacting
with Newsweek editors that he
eventually decided to pursue a
career in journalism - a path he

tary, the students will read the 9/11
Commission Report and listen to
a presentation by Lorry Fenner, a
staff member of the 9/11 Commis-
sion. They'll also read works of
fiction such as John Updike's "Ter-
rorist," a narrative account of an
American-born Muslim recruited
to be a terrorist.
Marwil said his goal for the
course is to address 9/11 from every
possible angle.
"By the end of the class I want
them to have a critical understand-
ing of what happened and how we
have thought about it, how we've
dealt with it and how we've chosen
to remember it," Marwil said.
The inspiration for the course
came from a 2006 freshman semi-
nar Marwil taught on the coverage
of significant events, including 9/11.
It was from that class Marwil said
he began considering the wealth
of information on the tragedy and
realized there was enough for an
entire class.
"I thought, 'Why not a whole
course on 9/11, and a course devot-
ed to the consequences across a

wide spectrum?"' Marwil said.
However, he saidhe understands
when people question why a course
on 9/11 is considered "history."
"For a long time it was thought
that you couldn't write the history
of anything closer than 50 years to
your own time," Marwil said.
Of course, 9/11 is quite the oppo-
site - a contemporary event with a
significant and ongoing impact on
the world around us. That makes
the class more challenging, Marwil
said, but it's a challenge his stu-
dents rise to.
"Wipe away your feelings, your
tears, your memories," Marwil
advised. "Now let's discuss this."
Several students in Marwil's
class pointed to the continuous rel-
evance of 9/11 as the reason they
enrolled.
"Normally in a history class
you're learning about someone who
died 300 years ago," LSA junior
Christine Irish said. "The differ-
ence is, (this) is something that's
very real for all of us."
LSA junior Glenne Fucci added
that the highly specialized nature

of the course made it appealing.
"It's really interestingthat there's
a class so specific, focused on such a
unique moment in time," Fucci said.
And as Irish pointed out, it's a
moment in time that's engrained in
every student's past.

time but still remember it to this

e-mail list this year and an average
attendance of 300 to 400 people at
MSA's large events, according to
Abdelhadi.
"It was not a fun time to be a
Muslim student at Michigan, but
really what you hear a lot in the
MSA community is that that was
sort of a turning point in MSA his-
tory," she said. "People talk about
that time like the golden years of
MSA - this year when things hap-
pened and people were suddenly
mobilized.
"Every activist sort of dreams
of the ability to just get everyone
together and do stuff, but it's real-
ly sad when it happens because
of a gigantic tragedy," Abdelhadi
added.
Before 9/11, MSA was mostly
focused on the spiritual health of
the community, Abdelhadi said.
But after the attacks, she said the
organization needed to initiate a
dialogue with the rest of campus
to distinguish true Islam from
the radical extremism that shook
members of their faith just as much
as non-Muslims.

day," Irish said. "I guess the fact
that it was the first major historical
event that I was a witness to made
me really interested in it."
But for Marwil, the course is
about moving away from memory
toward understanding. As he put
it, "I want them to learn, not just
emote."
To do this, the association held
multiple information sessions
about Islam to educate people on
what they claimed to be afraid
of. On Sept. 27, 2001 the associa-
tion held a joint teach-in with the
School of Social Work. At the event,
MSA members urged non-Muslim
female students to wear a hijab the
following day in an act of solidar-
ity with their fellow students. \J-n
and women who felt uncomfortable
in headscarves were encouraged to
wear white wristbands.
"If many, many women got
together and put on the hijab, it
would help diffuse the misplaced
anger that's being forced on any-
body that might be considered
Muslim," Lisa Leven, one of the
event organizers, said at the time.
Events like the teach-in and
A Walk in My Shoes - a current
MSA program that connects Mus-
lim and non-Muslim students to
exploreeach other's perspectives -
helped eradicate discrimination by
familiarizing students with Islam,
Abdelhadi said.
"You're less likely to be phobic
if you have a Muslim friend," sbe
said.

Geoffrey Gagnon
Former Michigan Daily Editor in Chief

cOURTESY OF GEOFFREY GAGNON
Former Michigan Daily staffers David Enders, Jen Fish and Rachel Green produce
the Sept.12, 2001 edition of The Michigan Daily.

For The Michigan Daily's
paper on Sept. 12, 2001, Geoffrey
Gagnon, then-editor in chief of
the Daily, was originally planning
to run a lead news story about
a student-athlete who had been
accused of sexual assault. Need-
less to say, there was a different
lead story that day.
When Gagnon's roommate
woke him up on the morning of
9/11to tellhim a plane had crashed
into the World Trade Center in
New York City, Gagnon knew

immediately where he needed to
be - the Daily newsroom.
"Pretty much everyone on
staff just kind of flooded into the
Daily," Gagnon said. "There was a
sense that that was a place where
people were trying to make sense
of what was going on."
Gagnon recalled the camarade-
rie felt amongDaily staff members
as they tried to make sense of the
tragedy while watching the after-
math of the attacks on television.
"We didn't know what we were

watching, and we certainly didn't
know how it was going to impact
the University of Michigan, but
we figured that was the place we
all wanted to be, and we wanted to
figure it out together," he said.
Gagnon said the major chal-
lenge for him and other Daily staff
members that day was determin-
ing how the campus newspaper
would respond to the tragedy.
"We all were trying to figure
out what should be reflected in the

was hesitant to pursue despite his
position at the Daily.
When Newsweek editors
inquired about his future career
plans, Gagnon said he wasn't
interested in working in the
newspaper industry. However
the persistent editors convinced
him otherwise and offered him
a position as an intern with the
company, which eventually
helped to launch his career as a

magazine writer.
"I wouldn't have done that
had I not had that experience
with those folks," Gagnon said.
"Explaining to them how it is
that we tried to make sense of
things here ... it also helped con-
vince me that doing that type
of work is really gratifying and
valuable, and it's something that
I thought I wanted to do."

A Different Kind of Defense
Keeping the Wolverine faithful safe in an unpredictable era
By Joseph Lichterman

,:ineteen men. Four airplanes.
Two thousand nine hundred and
ninety-six casualties. After a day
when the unthinkable happened,
Americans woke up on Sept. 12,
2001 with the fear that anything
was possible.
What would be next?
Iconic buildings across the
country were immediately
deemed potential targets. With a
stadium where more than 110,000
individuals gather most fall Satur-
days, the University's Department
oftublic Safety took serious steps
to protect Michigan Stadium, and
the entire campus, from potential
terror attacks.
Days passed. Months went by.
The next attack never came.
Seventy football games and one
hockey game have been contested
in Michigan Stadium since Sept.
11, and with the 71st scheduled for
Saturday night, there has yet to be
a successful terrorist attack on the
Big House, Ann Arbor and even

the United States since that Tues-
day morninga decade ago.
Of course, nobody knew what'
was to come on the morning of
Sept. 11, 2001. DPS was quick to
respond that Tuesday afternoon,
said DPS Deputy Police Chief Joe
Piersante. DPS immediately sent
officers out on the streets, and off-
duty police officers were called in
so DPS would be more visible on
campus.
"There was speculation about
how widespread the attacks
were," Piersante recalled. "There
was speculation that the White
House may be attacked, and of
course we're a major university,
and we have a world-renowned
trademark and we would consider
ourselves a possible target, espe-
cially with the largest stadium in
the United States."
"And we were coming up on a
football Saturday," he added.
Michigan was scheduled to
play Western Michigan that Sat-
urday, but the game
was postponed out of
respect for the vic-
tims ofthe attacks and
security concerns.
"We are sensitive
... to the concerns we
have heard fromthose
who feel a strongneed
to signal our respect
in the most public
way we have available
to us," then-Athletic

as the image of the smoldering
World Trade Center was still fresh
in America's collective psyche.
Despite potential security
threats, players and fans alike
expressed a desire to move on and
* regain a sense of normalcy.
"I don't think security is that
big of an issue," then-defensive
tackle Dave Pearson told The
Michigan Daily before the 2001
game against Western Michigan.
"Sure, people wonder when you
get 110,000 people in the stadium
together. You know, I feel that if
you're going to cancel one game
you might as well cancel them all,
because the chances (of something
happening) each week are just as
likely."
In November 2001, all bags
were forbidden from Michigan
Stadium, but the restriction was
lifted during the 2002 season. In
the years since, infrastructure
improvements - including addi-
tional video cameras and vehi-
tle barricades - were added to
Michigan Stadium, according to
Piersante. There have even been
periods of time when the Fed-
eral Aviation Administration has
banned planes from flying overthe
Big House.

In 2002, DPS created its canine
unit, with two dogs specifically
trained to search for and detect
explosives and other weapons.
"When we sat down and did
some brainstorming in the after-
math of 9/11, we looked at what
we needed to do as a department

specialized functions," Piersante
said. "One of the first ones on the
agenda was adding a K-9 program,

tion dogs."
officers have also received
enhanced training for active
shooter or terrorist-like scenarios
and DPS created a tactical team

to quickly and efficiently handle
potential terrorist incidents,
according to Piersante.
Even now, 10 years after 9/11,
the University's security measures
continue to evolve. Since Sept. 26,
2009, fans have been prohibited
from bringing bags inside Michi-
gan Stadium. The ban came after
federal agents arrested a suspect-
ed terrorist who was believed to
have been plotting several attacks,
including ones against sports sta-
diums.
This Saturday, the 115,000 fans
expected to pack Michigan Sta-
dium for the first-ever night game
in Michigan history, will still feel

their bags behind.

Juan Cole
University History Professor

Besides the destruction and
tragedy that resulted from the
Sept.11 attacks, University His-
tory Prof. Juan Cole, sees another
harmful outcome - stripping away
Americans' civil rights.
Cole, who is the author of a blog
titled Informed Comment in which
he discusses Middle Eastern and
U.S. politics, said the attacks ini-
tially had a unifying effect on the
nation.
"Of course everybody was
shocked that this happened and
confused as to why, but initially
oninionrolls suenestedr that there

wasn't any great hostility towards
Muslims in general as a result of
the attacks," he said. "Itwas under-
stood by the American public that
that was done by a terrorist group."
However, as Americans banded
together, they also experienced a
decrease in personal liberties, Cole
said.
"Among the more troubling out-
comes of September 11 was a will-
ingness of the American public to
acquiesce in terms of their own
civil rights and acceptance of prac-
tices such as torture that I think
would not have been acceptable
pre-9/11," he said.
Cole became the subject of
national media attention when it
surfaced that members of George
W. Bush's administration had
allegedly launched an investiga-
tion of him due to his criticisms of
the former president and the Iraq
War on his blog.
While Cole said Americans have
seen temporary losses of certain
civil liberties in the past - as in the
post-World War I repression and
the McCarthy period in the 1950s
- the policies made after Sept. 11
seem more permanent.

"In the case of the aftermath
of 9/11, many of the changes have
been institutionalized and the
activities of the National Security
Agency, which engages in signals
intelligence and the creation of
secret spy cams inside the U.S. gov-
ernment, makes it more difficult to
roll these particular abuses back
than in the past," Cole said.
He added that as the United
States becomes further removed
from the events of 9/11 with time,
the political leverage of the tragedy
is weakened.
"I think the emotions have sub-
sided to the point where it would
be very difficult to use September
i1 to launch a war," he said.
Instead, Cole said he believes
the ongoing legacy of Sept. 11 will
be the policies the public agreed to
in the aftermath of the tragedy.
"(9/11 made Americans) more
willing to accept domestic surveil-
lance of various sorts. I think many
of the rights and the Bill of Rights
have been weakened," Cole said.
"And this has been made possible
by public acquiescence and govern-
ment actions."

Center collapses after attack
Students were left stunned, saddened and frantic to reach
friends and family yesterday morning after a pair of hijacked
airliners slammed into and demolished both towers of New
York City"s World Trade Center. The attack is the worst ter-
rorist episode ever carried out in the United States.
Television stations carried live footage of the buildings"
collapse, including pictures of a hijacked Boeing 757 slam-
ming into the south tower. The attack began at about 8:45
a.m., and by 10:30 a.m. both buildings were absent from the
city"s skyline. In Washington, about 100 people died when a
plane crashed into the Pentagon.
"Our society changes as of today. This is a watershed
event," said Law Prof. Robert Precht, the attorney for one of
the four men convicted of bombing the World Trade Center
in 1993.
"I'm overwhelmed. I kind of wish I was back in the city I
can"t reach my friends, the lines are down. I used to work
down there, on the 82nd floor of the World Trade Center. I
don"t know if any of my co-workers actually survived," said

Classes for the day were canceled around noon. About
15,000 students attended a vigil in the Diag last night, short-
ly after President George Bush made his first address from
the Oval Office.
"I'm a former student from (New York University) and I"m
still waiting to hear from people," said LSA sophomore Anna
Szymanski at the vigil. "One NYU dorm is a block away from
the trade center I"m praying everyone is safe."
At the Michigan Union shortly after the bombing, LSA
freshman Aubair Simonson purchased a poster of the New
York City skyline.
"I'm going to hang it. I'm never going to forget this day," he
said. "All we have left now of the World Trade Center, which
is almost the centerpiece of the New York skyline which I
love, is just pictures."
In Ann Arbor, city and federal buildings also closed around
noon. So many people responded to a call to donate blood,
hospitals were forced to turn them away. More than 15,000 students assembled on the Diag for a candlelight vigil on the night of Sept.t/, 2001. y

Vandal Heuvel
N ROTC Commanding Officer

Captain R.E. Vanden Heuvel,
commanding officer and profes-
sor of navel science in the Univer-
sity's Naval Reserve Officer Training
Corps, was an executive officer of an
E-2C commanding control squad in
Northern Virginia at the time of the
9/11 terrorist attacks.
His squad was planningto attend
a final briefing regarding their six-
month deployment, which was
scheduled for October, when his wife
called and told him that a plane had
hit the World Trade Center.
"(I) didn't necessarily think any-
thing of it, to be honest," Heuvel
said. "(I) presumed it was just a small
airplane, an accident, that kind of
thing."
However, as Heuvel approached
the military installation gate in Vir-
ginia Beach, the alarms went off and
the guards had been told to close the
gates.
"We were watching TV, saw the

first tower that was still on fire, and
looked up, and (saw) the second air-
plane hit," he said. -
The briefings stopped when news
arrived that the third plane hit the
Pentagon, and the squad was told to
return to their units and standby for
further instruction. Heuvel's squad
eventually received direction to take
off and fly over the Atlantic to assist
the Federal Aviation Administra-
tion controllers identify incoming
airplanes and make sure they were
landing where instructed.
Despite his participation, Heuvel
recalled that he did not quite under-
stand the full situation at the time.
"We knew obviously that there
was a problem, because the F-16
(planes were) all flying next to us, all
fully armed, so we realized that this
wasn'tanexercise," he said.
The incident altered Heuvel's
deployment cycle and led to a shorted
preparation timeline for his squad.

"I looked at my wife and my kids
and I said, 'I have a feeling that I'm
leaving soon - I don't know what's
going on, butI have a feelingthat I'm
.going to be leavingsoon."'
Heuvel was deployed on Septem-
ber 24 or25, he recalled.
Among many things, the 9/11
attacks affected the military in giv-
ing them a more specific training
focus, Heuvel said.
"We knew for a while that we
needed to train differently and think
differently," he said. "We just weren't
exactly sure how or why, or what we
were really goingto face."
Heuvel said he believes that
after 9/11, the public developed a
new understanding of the military.
Because previous attacks targeted
the military overseas and did not
affect domestic civilians, terrorist
attacks were not in everybody's fore-
front prior to 9/11, he said.

Ten years after the 9/11 terror-
ist attacks, some people still have
a fear of flying. But former Univer-
sity President James Duderstadt
isn't one of them. In fact, he flew to
New York City just a few days after
the attacks.
In 2001, Duderstadt - who was
the University's president from
1988 to 1996 - was serving on the
board of directors of information
technology company Unisys. The
company had scheduled a board
meeting in Manhattan the week-
end followingthe tragedy and they
decided to proceed with it.
"Our board believed it was very
important not to cancel the meet-
ing to convey a sense of confidence
in the ability of New York City to
recover from this shock," Duder-
stadt wrote in an e-mail interview.
But the passengers on the flight
to New York's LaGuardia Airport
were sparse, as Duderstadt was
only one of two people on the
plane.
"There were only a couple of
passengers on my 757, along with
the flight crew. Our final approach
into LaGuardia took us right up the
river by the World Trade Center. It
was a very strange experience,"
Duderstadt wrote, adding that he
took a photo of Ground Zero from
the plane.

When the first plane crashed
on Sept. 11, 2001, Duderstadt was
in his office and, like many people
across the country on that day,
watched on television the second
plane crash and the subsequent
collapse of the towers. _4
"Throughout the day I remem-
ber the urgency, the tragedy and
the constant speculation about
other threats -some real, many
imagined," Duderstadt wrote.
In addition to the obvious mon-
umental impact the attacks had on
the nation, Duderstadt noted that
9/11 also affected the University.
Duderstadt said he canceled a Uni-
versity alumni trip to Kenya that
was supposed to take place three
weeks later. He wrote that he and
other participants were concerned
for the alumni's safety since there
was a possibility of "political
disruption" around the world if
the United States were to invade
Afghanistan.
"Clearly the attack had a major
impact on America just as it had
on the University," Duderstadt
wrote. "It also had an impact on
my own activities, which have
shifted to a more active role in
national security activities since
2001."
