SCOTUS decision
clears path for
same-sex marriage
in five states
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily News Editor
Same-sex marriage is now
legal in 24 states after the U.S.
Supreme Court refused to hear
appeals from five states con-
cerning same-sex marriage
Monday.
The high court's decision
effectively legalizes same-sex
marriage inIndiana, Oklahoma,
Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin
by upholding the decisions of
lower courts, all of which ruled
in favor of same-sex groups. In
Michigan, however, the deci-
sion remains in the hands of the
Sixth Circuit Cou'rt of Appeals.
On March 21, U.S. District
Judge Bernard Friedman struck
down Michigan's ban on same-
sex marriage and a prohibition

on the adoption of children by
same-sex . couples. Michigan
Attorney General Bill Schuette
(R) followed Friedman's ruling
by requesting the decision be
stayed, which was granted by
the Sixth Circuit on March 22.
Before the stay, more than 300
same-sex couples were issued
marriage licenses by four of
Michigan's 83 county clerks
who stayed open on a Saturday
to process those applications.
The Michigan chapter of
the American Civil Liberties
Union filed a request in May for
the state to recognize the 300-
plus couples married in March.
The ACLU was also co-counsel
in five of the seven petitions
that the Supreme Court denied
today.
Jay Kaplan, an attorney with
ACLU of Michigan's LGBT
Project, said the Supreme
Court's decision to deny the
appeals shows that it approves
of the decisionsby lower courts,
which have been overwhelm-
ingly in favor of same-sex mar-

Body discusses ways
to interact better
with University
community
By CAROLINE BARON
Daily StaffReporter
The Senate Advisory Commit-
tee on University Affairs gathered
Monday in the Regents Room

of the Fleming Administration
Building to discuss several ways
in which SACUA can support
faculty members and students on
campus.
SACUA chair Scott Masten, a
professor of business econom-
ics and public policy in the Ross
School of Business, reported on
his weekly meeting with Univer-
sity Provost Martha Pollack. Mas-
ten said they discussed the Office
of Institutional Equity, which
works to encourage diversity and

opportunity for all members of
the University community, their
continued attentiveness to issues
regarding sexual harassment on
campus, and the ongoing investi-
gation by the U.S. Department of
Education's Office of Civil Rights.
Pollack also asked Masten to
propose a new idea to SACUA:
that faculty host dinners for
newly admitted University stu-
dents in an effort to engage them
on campus immediately after they
arrive.

Several SACUA members
expressed interest in this idea,
saying this opportunity might
deter students from immediately
gravitating to the "drunken par-
ties" that often take place during
the beginning of the school year.
"We want to make sure (new
students') first impressions are
not football and alcohol, it's some-
thing more academic - a more
positive side of the University,"
Masten said.

Schauer puts
emphasis on
state funding

Gubernatorial
candidate runs on
platform to improve
higher education
By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffReporter
Styling himself as the poten-
tial "education governor," Dem-
9cratic gubernatorial candidate
Mark Schauer has seized on
several issues in higher educa-
tion policy as a part of his cam-
paign platform.
At the heart of most educa-
tions are state appropriations,
where incumbent Republican
Gov. Rick Snyder has had a
mixed record. Snyder cuthigher
education funding by 15 percent
during his first year in office,
then approved increases in the
following three years.
Schauer has criticized those
cuts and said he plans to restore
funding to the state's universi-
ties and colleges if elected.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily earlier this
month, Schauer said he sees a
number of benefits to increasing
funding for higher education.
"Budgets are a reflection of
our priorities and our values,"
he said. "And higher education
is a priority and value of mine
because it will help strengthen
our economy and help us grow,
become more competitive and
create faster economic growth,
lowerunemployment andbetter
wages for people. It benefits us
* all. It benefits the state."

I n20"?, the Snyder admin-
istration cited an acute budget
shortfall and a push for fiscal
responsibility as reasons for the
15-percent cut. The budget also
saw cuts to tax credits for low-
income workers and the end of
Michigan's subsidies to movie
production companies filming
in the state. Following those
cuts, there were increases in
higher education funding of 3.1
percent in 2012, 2.2 percent in
2013, and 6.1 percent in 2014.
During the fiscal year 2015
budget announcement, then-
State Budget Director John
Nixon said the cuts weren't nec-
essarily a permanent decision
and the eventual goal was to
bring funding back to pre-2011
levels.
Kurt Weiss, communications
director for the state's Depart-
ment of Technology, Manage-
ment and Budget, confirmed in
an e-mail interview that this
goal is still on track, though
he added that specific levels
of funding for programs like
higher education can't be deter-
mined until state revenue fore-
casts for the year are released.
"While at this point we can't
give a specific timeline as to
when full restoration of high-
er education funding will be
achieved because we have not
yet seen the revenue forecasts,
the governor will continue to
make strategic investments in
education given the revenues
that are available," Weiss wrote.
The University's Ann Arbor
campus lost $47.5 million in
funding due to the 2011 drop.

Council
considers
crosswalk
ordinance
City officials
postpone vote on
amendment by
6-5 margin
By JACK TURMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
Discussion at Monday
night's City Council meet-
ing became heated over a
proposed amendment to the
city's controversial crosswalk
ordinance.
The proposal would have
amended the ordinance's cur-
rent language, which states
that drivers are required to
stop when a pedestrian is
approaching a crosswalk,
by adding the phrase "if the
driver can do so safely." The
change would mean drivers
are no longer required to stop
for pedestrians nearing the
curb if they deem stopping
unsafe.
The Council ultimately
voted to postpone a vote on
the amendment, which was
sponsoredby Councilmember
Stephen Kunselman (D-Ward
3). The postponement passed
with a 6-5 margin.
During discussion of the
ordinance, tensions flared
and the dialogue quickly
escalated once the Council
considered postponing the
vote.
Kunselman, who opposed
the delay, said the ordinance
required immediate changes,
citing accidents caused by

Dr. Samuel Mathew
emphasizes need for
technology to improve
opportunities
By NABEEL CHOLLAMPAT
For the Daily
Mobile technology could open
new possibilities for people with
disabilities.
On Monday, the School of
Information hosted Dr. Samuel
N. Mathew, executive director of
the National Institute of Speech
& Hearing and director of the
Regional Institute of Physical
Medicine and Rehabilitation in
Kerala, India, who delivered a
lecture on access to technology
for people with disabilities.
Duringthe talk, Mathew high-
lighted the necessity of mobile
technology platforms for improv-
ing the quality of life for people

with disabilities in India. He said
these platforms can be especially
beneficial for the visually chal-
lenged, speech-impaired, hear-
ing-impaired, those with limited
cognition and agility impairment
and people on the autism spec-
trum.
However, Mathew said imple-
menting this kind of technology
requires a different approach in
India compared to in other coun-
tries.
"It's not about trying to make
things like here, but instead try-
ing to dothings thatare applicable
there," he said. "The environment
definitely has its constraints, but
examining that and then applying
technology is what will ultimate-
ly work."
NISH, also based in Kerala,
provides language and speech
training for congenitally deaf
students. Recently, the institute
began providinghigher education
and granting degrees to these
children.

Kevin Smith, a graduate stu-
dent in the Information School,
worked with NISH and Mathew
this past summer to. launch the
website accesshub.org. The site
is dedicated to providing policy
information and services for peo-
ple with disabilities in India.
Smith stressed that the web-
site's main goal is accessibility.
"Oftentimes in web develop-
ment, accessibility isn't neces-
sarily on the forefront, and that's
something I think the School of
Information and web designers
can work on," he said.
Mathew said Access Hub,
along with other efforts to expand
access to technology in India,
could help break down cultural
barriers. He said many people
with disabilities believe they did
something wrong in a previous
life - a concept found in a num-
ber of faiths in India - to deserve
their condition.

Videojournalist suffering
from Ebola arrives in U.S.

Five things to know about

candidate Debbie

Cameraman is fifth
American to return
to U.S. for treatment
OMAHA, Neb. (AP) - An
American video journalist who
contracted Ebola while work-
ing in Liberia stepped off 4 jet
Monday under his own power
on his way to a Nebraska hos-
pital where he will be treated
for the disease in a specialized
containment unit.
At the bottom of the jet's
steps, Ashoka Mukpo was
loaded onto a stretcher for the
ambulance ride to the Nebras-
ka Medical Center.
Mukpo533, was working as a
freelance cameraman for NBC
News when he became ill last
week. He is the fifth Ameri-
can with Ebola to return to
the U.S. for treatment during
the latest outbreak, which the
World Health Organization
estimates has killed more than
H-S

3,400 people.
Mukpo's parents said they
tried to talk him out of going to
Liberia last month, but he told
them he wanted to report on
the severity of the epidemic.
"I told him I thought he
was crazy," said his father, Dr.
Mitchell Levy.
"And I begged him from
a mother's perspective. I
said, 'Please don't go,"' Diana
Mukpo said. "But there was
nothing to do. He was deter-
mined."
Before returning to Libe-
ria last month, Mukpo had
lived there for two years while
working as a researcher for
the Sustainable Development
1 Institute, a nonprofit focused
on the concerns of workers in
mining camps outside Monro-
via. He only returned home to
Providence, Rhode Island, in
May.
It's not clear how Mukpo
was infected, but Levy said it
may have happened when he
5-m

helped clean a vehicle someone
died in.
On Monday, his symptoms of
fever and nausea still appeared
mild, Levy said.
During his treatment, his
parents will have to rely on a
video chat system in his hospi-
tal room to communicate with
him.
Meanwhile in Texas, a Libe-
rian man with Ebola who start-
ed showing symptoms while
visiting the U.S. remained in
critical condition at a Dallas
hospital.
Texas Gov. Rick Perry said
he would create a state task
force to ensure Texas develops
a rapid-response plan if an out-
break develops in the state.
Perry also called on federal
officials to implement screen-
ing procedures at all U.S.
points of entry. He said screen-
ers should take travelers' tem-
perature and conduct other
assessments to determine their
overall health.
Doctors at the Nebraska
isolation unit - the largest of
four in the U.S. - will evalu-
ate Mukpo before determin-
ing how to treat him. They
said they will apply the lessons
learned while treating Ameri-
can aid worker Rick Sacra, who
was allowed to return home
to Massachusetts after three
weeks, on Sept. 25.
Sacra received an experi-
mental drug called TKM-
Ebola, as well as two blood
transfusions from another
American aid worker who
recovered from Ebola at an
Atlanta hospital. The trans-
fusions are believed to help
a patient fight off the virus
because the survivor's blood
carries antibodies for the dis-
ease.
In Dallas, the Liberian man
was listed in critical condi-
tion. Thomas Eric Duncan has
been hospitalized at Texas
Health Presbyterian Hospital
since Sept. 28. He is receiving
an experimental medication
called brincidofovir.

A liberal
philanthropist,
Dingell looks to
succeed husband
By EMILIE PLESSET
Daily Staff Reporter
With the general election
less than a month away, Demo-
crat Debbie Dingell is hoping to
succeed her husband, U.S. Rep.
John Dingell, as the U.S. House
representative for Michigan's
12th District, which includes
Ann Arbor and Detroit's west-
ern suburbs.
Dingell is currently presi-
dent of D2 Strategies, and chair
of the Wayne State University
Board of Governors. She has
also served as president and
senior executive responsible for
public affairs for the General
Motors Foundation. Dingell is
active in many charities in both
Michigan and Washington,
D.C., and has been listed as one
of the, most powerful women
in D.C. by the Washingtonian
and one of the most influential
women in Michigan by Crain's
Detroit Business.
1. She is has a focus on
providing affordable health
care and has advocated for
women and children's issues.
As a founder of the National
Women's Health Resource Cen-
ter, Dingell said a highlight of
her resum6 is her leadership in
the national effort to include
women in federally funded
health research.
She wants to address the
issue of providing resources to
an aging population as well as
the stigma regarding mental

health.
"Health issues are very, very
important to me," Dingell said.
"We are behind the rest of the
world; we need to be invest-
ing in research that is finding
answers to all these problems."
2. Shewantstoreduce
student loan interest rates
and increase state funding for
higher education.
Dingell said education has
always been one of her most
critical concerns.
As chair of the Wayne State
Board of Governors, Dingell
has had experience with edu-
cation policy. As chair, she was
responsible for presiding over
board meetings.
She noted that she recently
voted against a tuition increase
at Wayne State.
"Too many young people
who can't afford college or uni-
versities are graduating with
staggering debt," Dingell said.
"We've got to look at waiving
the interest rate that young
people are paying and mak-
ing sure that they are having
access to affordable student
loans. I believe that education
is a public good and it is an
important thing for the state to
invest in."
3. She supports gay rights.
IDingell said she advocates for
policies thatend discrimination.
She hopes to expand opportuni-
ties for all Americans.
"If two people love each
other, why should we keep them
from being with each other?"
Dingell said.
4. She hopesto expand
job creation.

Dingell
Dingell said while the auto
industry has recovered some-
whatthe job market has yet to
recover from the 2008 financial
crisis.
She wants to encourage busi-
ness and labor ttiwork together
to strengthen the economy and
bring people into the state to
work.
"I'm concerned about young
people having jobs when they
graduate, and I'm concerned
about people that are being
forced into early retirement in
their early 50s that actually have
decades left in them that they
want to work hard," Dingell said.
"We've got to continue to invest
Sineconomic development." .-
S. Ifelected, she will be the
firstwomanto succeed a
living husband in Congress.
John Dingell, the longest-
serving member of the House
in U.S. history, will retire at the
conclusion of this term. While
many other women have suc-
ceeded their husbands in Con-
gress, Debbie Dingell would
be the first to succeed a living
husband.
"I want people to know that
I want to listen, and fight for
them and to be their advocate,"
Dingell said.
Dingell said while her hus-
band is a great influence and
has taught her a lot, she is her
own person with her own posi-
tions on today's issues.
"I'm not trying to fill John
Dingell's shoes because I know
how big they are and I could
never fill them; I'm going to be
Debbie Dingell," she said. "I'm
my own person. We share many
values, but I bring a women's
perspective to many of the
issues."

ers have occupied the Dutch Par-
liament building and are calling
for more action to combat the
Islamic State terror group.
The official Twitter feed of The
Hague police says the demonstra-
tion late Monday is peaceful and
that officers are in talks with the
protest leaders. Police advised the
public not to go to the square out-
side Parliament.
National broadcaster NOS
posted video on its website show-
ing chanting protesters inside
the Parliament building holding
a banner that said in Dutch "Stop
the silence. Support Kobani," a
reference to the Syrian town close
* to the Turkish border that was
under attack Monday by Islamic
State fighters.

SACUA member Bill Shultz speaks at the SACUA meeting in the Fleming Administration Building Monday.

SACUA
From Page 1
Another important item on
the docket was the recently
implemented Fitness For Duty
policy. Enacted by a group of the
University's deans, the program
assesses situations in which
an employee is experiencing
observable difficulty safely per-
forming his or her job. SACUA
had a few concerns with the new
policy, primarily that the deans
both refer faculty for FFD evalu-
ation and dictate FFD outcomes.

"All reports go to the dean,
who is the final decision-maker,
so you have the case of the pros-
ecutor and the judge being the
same person," Masten said.
There were also questions of
whether or not faculty should
be financially compensated
while under FFD review. Ulti-,
mately, the committee decided
the policy required thorough
examination and SACUA voted
to continue discussing it at the
next meeting.
SACUA acts as a .liaison
between faculty and a variety of
important assembly committees

and makes decisions about which
issues fall under each commit-
tee's jurisdiction. They discussed'
Monday the Committee on the
Economic Status of the Faculty
and ways to improve transpar-.
ency regarding faculty salaries.
University President Mark
Schlssel recently told Masten
they he had been receiving push-
back from the Business school
on this initiative. Moving for-
ward, SACUA will consult with
Schlissel throughout the semes-
ter, and their first official private
meeting is scheduled for next
Wednesday.

COUNCIL

pedestrians who walk into the
blind spots of cars and expect
them to stop.
"Stopping for the pedestrian
at the curb is not about them
being endangered," Kunselman
said. "It's about being courteous
for them to cross. They've never
been in danger standing at the
curb. It's the pedestrians that
step into the road is where the
danger begins."
The city's current ordinance
was enacted in:response to the,
death of a University student,
who was hit by a car while cross-
ing Plymouth Road last year.
"Every accident that has
taken place in the community
since this ordinance has been
changed, it has been pedestrians
(putting) themselves in a posi-
tion of danger because some-
body was nice to stop for them,"
Kunselman said. "Partly, that
stopping was because we cre-
ated a law that mandated driver
courtesy."
After a discussion among the
councilmembers that was closed
to the general public, Mayor
John Hieftje (D) rebutted some
of Kunselman's arguments.
"There is no evidence to say
that anyone has been damaged
or hurtbecause our ordinance is
slightly different," he said.
Kunselman also sponsored
legislation last year to amend
Ann Arbor's crosswalk legis-
lation. The ordinance passed.
through the Couni l but was,
vetoed by- Hieftje, who told the

council during the discussion
in December that "Changing
the ordinance, I just don't see a
wayhow that can possiblyhelp. I
think the city is safer for pedes-
trians now than before."
Hieftje, who was a vocal
supporter of postponing the
vote Monday, said he wanted
to see what the state or the
Council's Pedestrian Safety
and Access Task Force would
recommend.
"I think we should stop fid-
dling with this until some
further action by either our
Pedestrian Task Force or by the
state,"'he said.
Councilmember Sally Hart
Petersen (D-Ward 2), who
also supported delaying the
vote, has been involved with
State Rep. Adam Zemke's (D-
Ann Arbor) efforts to alter the
state's crosswalk rules. The
Michigan Uniform Traffic Code
requires drivers to stop or slow
for pedestrians walking across
a crosswalk; not pedestrians
approachingthe crosswalk.
"I don't think it's necessary
to try and redo our ordinance
again only to have it changed at
the state level, and perhaps the
state will come up with some-
thing that we can all agree on,"
Petersen said.
She said she would like to see
Ann Arbor wait for new state
rules before approving another
amendment to the city's ordi-
nance.
"What I would not want is for
the city of Ann Arbor to again
superimpose its own rules over
the ste'srules,"shesaid.

The cuts resulted in a 6.7-percent
tuition increase for in-state stu-
dents, as well as changes to class
sizes, the closing of several aca-
demic centers and other down-
sizing measures.
Snyder's campaign office was
not available for comment after
multiple interview requests from
the Daily.
Nationwide, fiscal year 2013
reflected a boost in government
highereducationfundinig,accord-
ingtothe State Hjgher 5ducation
Executive Officers Association.
State and local funding grew by
0.7 percent after years of reduc-
tion, though this level growth
was not as strong as in other years
of economic recovery.
"These data indicate that
recovery has begun, albeit more
slowly than after the recession
of the early 2000s, when educa-
tional appropriations per student
increased 5.0% during the first
year of recovery," SHEEO's fiscal
year 2013 report read.
SHEEO reported other
nationwide data that points to
declining federal funding in the
midst of soaring tuition costs.
For each full-time student, edu-
cation appropriations went from
$8,579 in 1988 to $6,105 in 2013,
which is $85 greater than the
lowest data point. Meanwhile,
net tuition revenue per full-time
student increased from $2,685 to
$5,475 - the highest tuition rate
in the study.
Back in Michigan, Schauer
said he has also developed sever-
al ideas regarding student debt.
Snyder has approached stu-
dent debt by encouraging dual-
credit opportunities - which
allow students to earn college

credit in high school - and
through incentives for univer-
sities to not raise tuition. His
primary initiative has been to
tie some state funding to a uni-
versity's ability to keep tuition
increases below a specified cap.
Schauer said two of his primary
approaches are the creation of a
student loan refinancing author-
ity and an increase in need-based
aid to lessen student debt.
Refinancing refers to the pro-
cess of taking out a second loan
at a lower interest rate, typically
due to factors such as market
fluctuations or changes in indi-
vidual credit score. at allows
paying off the original loan with
higher interest rates. The prac-
tice is available for other types of
loans, such as mortgages, but not
for manytypes of student loans.
In California and Wiscon-
sin, where similar refinancing
authorities have been proposed,
policymakers have suggested the
establishment of funds to protect
loan issuers against losses. Other
options include purchasing loans
from their original lender and
then backingthe new, lower-rate
loans themselves.
Schauer said his vision of a
student loan refinancing author-
ity for Michigan could function
as a "public-private partnership."
"The student loan refinanc-
ing authority doesn't necessarily
need to cost anything," he said.
"It could be a way of investing
state pension funds, or pooling or
aggregating other private sector
dollars."
According to Schauer's plan,
need-based scholarships would
be initially funded by savings
from increased efficiencies inthe
way government is run through
audits of every department and
the cancellation of several con-
troversial government contracts.

Schauer added that he believes
thatinthe longterm,theincrease
in aid will produce state revenue.
"It's not a zero-sum game,"
he said. "But in the short term,
it will take a commitment of
resources. What I'll start with is
by cutting some of the wasteful
programs and contracts within
state government."
He referenced Aramark, a
prison food services company
that took over the contract for
Michigan's prisons in Decem-
ber 2013 from state employees,
as one contract he would elimi-
nate. The company - which
currently operates uner $145
million contract - has faced
multiple complaints of inappro-
priate employee conduct and
food quality issues.
Like Snyder, Schauer has pro-
moted higher education as a way
to energize the state's economy
through building knowledge
capital in the state. He also point-
ed to a post-graduation factor
- namely, whether Michigan's
communities encourage. gradu-
ates to stay - as important for
the overall state discussion about
supporting higher education.
As of 2013, the last year for
which data was available, rough-
ly 37 percent of the class of 2012
left the state after matricula-
tion, according to a study by
the Detroit Economic Regional
Chamber.
"You know, there is a brain
drain here in Michigan," Schau-
er said. "We have the ability to
use some of these policy tools
to help address that brain drain,
but there are a number of other
areas as well. We need jobs. And
we need healthy, livable dynamic
cities that provide quality of life
and attract smart, talented cre-
ative people, including our col-
lege graduates."

riage.
The Sixth Circuit's decision
to uphold or strike the lower
courts' decision would lead to
the legalization of same-sex
marriage in Michigan, Ken-
tucky, Ohio and Tennessee,
Kaplan said.
"Today's decision only sheds
a window more on states like
Michigan that don't allow for
this fundamental right," Kaplan
said.
Schuette, who is up for re-
election in November, issued
a statement regarding the
Supreme Court's refusal to hear
the appeal.
"Michigan joins Ohio, Ten-.
nessee andKentuckyin awaiting
a decision by the Sixth Circuit
in our pending cases, which we.
expect will be resolved soon,"
said Schuette spokeswoman Joy
Yearout.

When Schuette appealed the
district court ruling in March,
he stated that a 2004 voter-
approved prohibition of same-
sex marriage shouldbe upheld.
"In 2004 the citizens of Mich-
igan recognized that diversity
in parenting is best for kids
and families because moms and
dads are not interchangeable,"
Schuette said in a statement.
"Michigan voters enshrined
that decision in our State con-
stitution, and their will should
stand and be respected."
Mark Totten, Schuette's
Democratic challenger in the
upcoming election, said in a
statement the attorney general's
argument is morally flawed, and
criticized his usage of taxpayer
money for expert witnesses in
the trial.
"There's a word for an Attor-
ney General wasting taxpayer
funds pursuing personal ideo-
logical crusades instead of
protecting Michigan families:
extreme," Totten said.

response to this, so the screams coming from
the students were conducive to her silence.
These types of students rally together to
mock and refute the opinions held by these
conservative Christians, but they seem to
provide more than just a crowd of laughing
students. It is not every day and in every situ-
ation that a girl who was sexually assaulted
when she was seven years old openly talks
about the assault. Oftentimes, women who
are victims of sexual abuse keep quiet about
their experience(s). The fear of not being lis-
tened to and believed isn't too hard to fath-
om, considering the way rape and sexual
abuse are treated in our society. But, when
you gather a group of college-aged students
who all oppose the extreme opinions of a-con-
servative group, there appears to be an open
space for dialogue about sexual assault. That
being said, it is clear that not every survivor of
sexual abuse is rallying on the Diag and speak-
ing up. If they were to, though, the flock of
students could be considered somewhat of an
unconventional and informal support group,
welcoming and supporting discussions of
assault. Here, one can remain somewhat anon-

share government secrets with the
young, vivacious journalist Zoe
Barnes, I was sure the show was
completely based on fiction. Each
time her phone rang and she was,
thankstoUnderwood'sbigmouth,the
first to print a story, I was astounded
by Underwood's audacity and Zoe's
acceptance. It only made the whole
thing seem more outrageous when
Zoe and Underwood started an illicit
affair. As I watched, I was reminded
of the Watergate scandal, when
journalists Bob Woodward and Carl
Bernstein had a source nicknamed
"Deep Throat" giving them all the
secrets about the Nixon scandal to
print.It was later confirmed that Deep
Throat was FBI Associate Director
Mark Felt. This relationship between
the press and the government in D.C.
seemed rare to me: an informant from
inside the government giving the
press information is a total breach of
both trust and security clearance, and
therefore I thought it was something
only true in movies or in the past.
This past week, however, a huge
Secret Service scandal started to
unravel. The talk of the town was that
one of Obama's Secret Service agents
leaked the President's2012 campaign
stops to a Romney aide several days
before the schedule was released to

eltway nav
the public. The agent's motivation
is said to have been to impress the
woman he was flirting with. Sound
familiar? It's like another version
of the Zoe/Frank story. Granted,
the White Ho'use has denied these
allegations, but in my seminar class
this week we discussed the possibility
of such a scandal. Our guest speaker,
a. Special Forces captain in the U.S.
Army, asked us to think about what
the morale of the Secret Service staff
must be like in order for one of them
to feel it would be OK to make such
a leak. We talked about incentives
that could lead government agents
to share information with the press.
Low morale
is a plausible I've ditched
scenario in the
recent Secret a
Service scandal, and come tc
especially inevitable
considering the
fact that Secret in each a

due to worries of
poor performance. It's also possible
that Secret Service morale has been
low for years, leading an agent to
feel like there wouldn't be many
repercussions for revealingPresident
Barack Obama's schedule.
Regardless of the outcome in
this particular scandal, all of these
combined events have .led me to
reassess my opinion that security
leaks don't often happen in D.C. In
fact, I would argue just the opposite.
I've ditched my naivete and come
to realize the human nature and the
inevitable fallibility in each and every
government servant.
The other day, something small
went missing in my office at the
Department of Justice. People were
complaining jokingly that perhaps it
was stolen. I looked at them skepti-
cally and said, "Yeah, right, this is the

DOJ There's so much security to get
into this building there's no way any-
thingcould get stolen."The head para-
legal looked at me and said, "Don't
assume that everyone with a govern-
ment badge is an honest person. Just
because someone has a badge doesn't
make them honest." Although we
all had to go through rigorous back-
ground checks to even walk through AM
the door, the truth is background
checks can only go so far. For a Secret
Service agent, an FBI administrator
or even an intern, secret data is widely
available and protected by the per-

BAMN supports firing of Dave Brandon

The recent protest and march to the Uni-
versity President's house calling for the firing
of Athletic Director David Brandon following=
the gross disregard for the health and safety
of sophomore quarterback Shane Morris is an
expression of the rising anger over the priva-
tization of the University and its unabashed
policy of prioritizing profits over the well-
being of students. There is growing desire
of students on this campus to take matters
into their own hands in the spirit of the mass
resistance against racism and police brutality
in Ferguson, Missouri. BAMN supports the
demand for the firing of David Brandon and
Michigan's coach Brady Hoke, and we call
for the organization of a union for student-
athletes that will provide protection from
dangerous, unhealthy practices and playing
conditions, that prevents the University from
revoking the scholarships of players who suf-
fer injuries and protects the overall educa-
tional and financial interests of the students
against the exploitation of the University.
The mistreatment and exploitation of stu-
dent athletes and the prioritizing of profits is
one of the many ways in which the Universi-
ty's administration has failed to provide a full
educational college experience with access
to opportunities and safety for all students.
Instead, the University has fostered and pro-
tected a growing, hostile campus climate, in
which safety and opportunities are no longer
a priority if they are in the way of profits and
against the interests of the increasingly con-
servative private donors and sponsors.
The hostile conditions on campus have
especially affected minority students whose

numbers have been dropping to levels not
seen since before the 1970s, and increasing
numbers of women students who are victims
of sexual assault and rape. The University
covered for former kicker Brendan Gibbons
after he assaulted a female student in 2009
because football profits are worth more to the
administration than the safety and well-being
of women on this campus. These policies are
not jsolated to the Athletic Department; they
come from top administrators all the way up
to the president.
Minority students should not have to
accept the degradation of unequal treatment
and racist slurs as a condition of being on this
campus. Women have a right to be on this
campus without living under the constant
threat of sexual harassment, assault and rape.
We want a truly public university that serves
the needs of humanity, not a private business
accountable to its private and corporate
donors. We want a campus that is welcoming
and feels like home to all of us, a place where
we all have the freedom to be ourselves, to
think, to explore our diverse interests and to
develop our talents to their fullest potential,
without being exploited in the financial
interest of the University administration.
Student movements for progress and equal-
ity have defined what is best about this Univer-
sity, not the administration. We can change the
conditions on this campus. We must take the
example of Ferguson and take matters into our
own hands and keep marching until we win.

According to the Human Rights
Campaign, an LGBTQ rights
organization, there are 1,138 benefits,
rights and protections provided to
married couplesthat arenot available
to same-sex couples. Michigan is one
of those states.
Imagine if your spouse was in an
automobile accident, and you rushed
to the emergency room desperate to
know she was ok. When you inquired
as to her location at the desk, you
were told that because you were
not her legal spouse or a member of
her family, you were not admitted.
This happens every day to same-sex
couples because this right, among
many other benefits, is only available
to legally married couples.
April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse
brought their case after a frightening
close call driving one winter day led
them to realize if one of them were to
perish, one or more of their children
could be placed with familythatthey
don't even know rather than staying
with their other parent. This was
a devastating thought that spurred
them to take action to gain the right
to adopt each other's children. The
judge in their case, Bernard Fried-
man, encouraged them to include a
challenge to the same-sex marriage
ban to get at the real problem behind
not being able to jointly adopt.
The judge ruled that the ban was
unconstitutional, and during one
day in March, 300 couples were
wed and now enjoy federal benefits.
However, these benefits are still
currently denied to most same-sex
couples because of their inability to
marry due to a stay on the ban. These
couples currently lie in wait, holding

young rapper in transition,

thinks this is a great time to

of all the support he gets from
that type of crowd.
"We can try out new mate-
rial with my main audience,"
he said, "the people that are
my age, 21-year-old seniors in
college."
That audience will likely
show up in droves to get a
glimpse at one of the most
promising young artists in
recent memory. It's practi-
cally unthinkable that, with-
out even a proper album to his
name yet, Chance is playing
venues as large as Hill and
the EMU Convocation Center
and garnering plenty of Kanye
West comparisons. Listen to
Acid Rap and you'll realize
that it's a mixtape that can
compete with any tradition-
ally released hip-hop record.
But Acid Rap is now the
past. With this fall run of
shows, we can hope that we're
going to get to see Chance
the Rapper grow up, experi-
ment and, perhaps, even make
something bolder and bigger
than he's ever done before.

Singer-songwriter to
play semi-acoustic
set at The Ark
ByAMRUTHASIVAKUMAR
DailyArts Writer
The Ark is no stranger
to the piano-ballad singer-
songwriter music scene. But
today, Virginia-native Rachael
Yamagata will come ready to
steal the stage.
For one thing, she'll step up
on the boards with a full band
backing her sound, adding
more density to her traditionally
earnest, .no-nonsense way of
story-telling. For another, her
music will tell a tale of evolution,
bringing together a mesh of
older, unseasoned records with a
neoteric splash of sounds.
Lyrically, Yamagata is fresh.
Her words focus less on the
romantic relationships that are
generally explored in the pop
landscape and push more toward
revealing intimate personal
struggles.
And so, she enunciates these
stories. Every word, is drawn

out to reveal the spectrum of
emotions that can be captured
from a melody. There's an
internal battle when Yamagata
sings, showing the difficulty
with which she has to master
every somber note that she puts
out on the stage.
"I'm not afraid of variety, and
that's perplexed record labels,
but it's been refreshing for me
as an artist to go wherever the
inspiration takes me," Yamagata
said of her evolution in sound,
describing her songwriting
process as instinctual, rather
than technical.
"I try to be open and
vulnerable in my songwriting,
and honest," she said. "It doesn't
always portray things in a light
and doing that gives people the
chance to experience a spectrum
of emotions"
When first breaking through
the female singer-songwriter
landscape, Yamagata said
quick comparisons were made
between her music and other
prominent artists of her genre.
While these references set a
stage for Yamagata to describe
her music to a newer audience,
she said nowadays shetries to be

intuitive.
"Initially there was a lot
of songwriter piano-based
comparison, people would look
to Norah Jones and Carol King
comparisons. Then I took up
guitar and people were citing
Bonnie Ray."
The Yamagata we see now,
hiding her heavy emotions
behind semi-acoustic
instruments, is no doubt very
different from the one we were
introduced to back in 2002.
Today, though, Yamagata
will bring to The Ark's stage
some of her older pieces from
Happenstance, her first record
since splitting from Chicago
band Bumpus. With that, she'll
be introducing five to six new
songs from her upcoming
releases. By bringing together a
unique medley of instruments,
such as banjos and saxophones,
she looks to elevate her presence
in the live music industry.
"Honestly the music is very
different from anything I've
ever done, and it's interesting to
me, it's a different soundscape
then I've ever had,' she
stressed. "A good story line is
important to the sound."

Directed by Rory Kennedy
("Ghosts of Abu Ghraib"), daugh-

skillfully weaves together a narra-

Combining interviews with Amer-
ican personnel who were serving
in Vietnam during the evacuation
and South Vietnamese who were
attempting to flee the country
with intimate 8mm footage of the
event, "Last Days" reveals the des-
peration of the country's refugees
and the unavoidable moral dilem-
mas created when people must
flee a country they have sworn to
protect.
As the North Vietnamese
advanced on the South, their
brutal executions and live buri-

refusing toevacuate until the last'
possible moment, many Ameri-
can soldiers and embassy workers
risked treason in order to illegally
evacuate South Vietnamese who
had worked closely with the Unit-
ed States. During the April 29th
evacuation of Saigon, thousands
of people surrounded the U.S.
embassy, appropriated military
helicopters and flew out to sea, or
jammed onto whatever ship they
could find, all desperately hop-
ing for an escape. For the Ameri-
cans and their poorly planned
evacuation, "the burning question
was who goes and who gets left
behind," according to a U.S. Air
Force Captain who took part in the
evacuation.
The difficulty of this question
adds a lot of tension to a subject
that is already historically intrigu-
ing and visually dramatic. In one
stunning reel of 8mm footage, the
audience witnesses people packing
themselves onto a moving plane
as it-takes off. In another reel, we,
see a South Vietnamese pilot who
must abandon his helicopter over
the ocean because it is too large to
land on the rescue ship.
Despite the documentary's
comprehensive coverage of the
evacuation of Saigon, it does lack
a personal look at what the con-
sequences were for those who
got left behind. "Last Days" tells
its audience about the North
Vietnamese mass executions and

forced; labor1in-reeducation?'
camps and even features inter-
views with men who survived
those camps. However, Kennedy
strangely never has them discuss
their suffering at the hands of the
communists. "Last Days" sets up
this great moral quandary, then
really fails to follow through on
what it meant personally and
emotionally for those unfortunate
souls we left behind.
While "Last Days in Vietnam"
is an incredibly powerful and
interesting documentary, a deep-
er discussion of the consequences
at a human level really would've
driven the point home, especially
considering its relevance to cur-
rent U.S. military operations
abroad. The film briefly glazes
over South Vietnam's feelings of
betrayal, a sentiment that eeri-
ly echoes ex-Afghan president
Hamid Karzai's accusations of
betrayal by the U.S. "Last Days"
could also give new perspective to
our military response to ISIS, the
brutal militant group sweeping
down from the north of Iraq in a
manner disconcertingly reminis-
cent of North Vietnam's devour-
ing of the South. A summation of
the film's events not only epito-
mizes the entire Vietnam War
rather nicely, but also our current
conflicts: promises made in good
faith, promises broken, but also
good people doing what needs to
be done in a screwed-up situation.

A rtTh Mchga Dily-(icigndilco
COMMUNITY & CULTURE COLUMN MSCRVE
Tier: Weird
shaow, iarious m
an genius

was first introduced
to the world of Tinder
last winter, when one
of my best friends from high
school showed me the app
over Christ-
mas break.
After spend-
ing her first
semester of
college in
Chicago, she
explained
to me that KATHLEEN
Tinder was DAVIS
all the rage
in the city,
an easy way to meet new boys
and ultimately to hook up
with them. She let me take
the reigns of her account for a
few minutes, where I scrolled
through the profiles of seem-
ingly endless bros - some
fratty, some alt-looking, but a
lot of just normal, nice-look-
ing guys.
For anyone out there who
has been blissfully oblivious
to the dating lives of college
students, Tinder is an iPhone
and Android app that takes
basic information from your
Facebook page, your first
name and age, a few pictures,
and puts them on a basic pro-
file that says the last time you
were active on the app and
how many miles away you are
from the person checking you
out. Matches are based on
geographic proximity, and you
must either swipe left for no,
or right for yes to move onto
another profile. If you swipe
right for a person and that
person swipes right for you,
you've mach "match" and
you can now start a message,
conversation, where you can
decide if the person is cool,
weird or interesting enough
to meet in person. Tinder is
based on Grindr, a similar app

exclusively for gay, bisexual
or curious men that launched
in 2009, and Tinder's setting
can be changed depending on
your sexuality as well, so it's
not just exclusive to hetero-
sexuals.
Here's a disclaimer: I don't
personally have a Tinder. I've
been in a happy, monogamous
relationship for a year and a
half so my need for a hook-up
app is negligible. But I find
the whole process fascinat-
ing enough to check out my
friends' accounts when I see
they're swiping through din-
ner. It also fascinates me that
of all my single friends in Ann
Arbor, almost all of them have
experimented with Tinder in
some way. Love it or hate it, it's
everywhere.
The first time I was shown
the app, I was perplexed. My
friend moved at lightning
speed, swiping left or right
depending on how douchey the
guy looked, barely reading the
short bios these guys provided.
Shirtless in all the pictures?
Swipe left. Surrounded by a
large group of girls? Swipe left.
From my experience, the more
normal looking the pictures
are and the more creative the
few sentences of bio, the more
likely you'll get a swipe right.
It's weird, shallow and hilar-
ious. And what demographic
would embrace this more will-
ingly than horny college kids
with nothing to lose?
The truth is, Tinder is
genius. An app to quickly meet
up with single people near
you for whatever amount of
intimacy you seek works seam-
lessly in the, opstant shuffle
of college life, particularly in
high-stress schools like U-M.
We're a generation completely
used to instant gratification
thanks to growing up with the

rise of the internet. We don't
have the time for OKCupid or
Match.com, we want sex at the
touch of a button and in the
same amount of time it would
take to order Pizza House.
Millennials are constantly
scrutinized by older genera-
tions for our widely publicized
"hook-up culture," considered
a correlation to lack of scruples
and doomed adult relation-
ships. Tinder itself has been
hugely scrutinized for being
shallow, since almost all that
swipes depend on are the pic-
tures on a person's profile.
But the thing is, how.is
this process more vain than
approaching someone at a bar
or party? It's still a decision
based on how attractive you
find someone. I'd even argue
that Tinder is safer than a
night at Rick's, since conver-
sation can't even start until
both parties have confirmed
"yes" to the other person. You
exchange messages for a little
while, decide if you want to
meet for a date and if the date
goes well maybe both parties
can get what they want. Sure,
the date could be awkward
and you could go home disap-
pointed, but you could also
have a great time. I even have
friends who've started seeing
boys met on Tinder semi-regu-
larly. Just don't try to explain
that to your parents.
Tinder away, Ann Arborites.
You're young, fun and as long
as you've got the sense to stay
in your comfort zone, you
could end up meeting cool
new people and have stories
to tell your friends. You've got
the rest of yryur ljves to settle,,
down.
Davis is taken, hence not
on Tinder. To congratulate her,

impact on my Weezer fandom.
Whereas Raditude and Hurley

doesn't do much at all; it might
be the most innocuous album
I've ever heard. But isn't that
even worse? In the future,
I'll shrug it off, choosing to
remember Weezer as the band

Academic opportunity faces Bain,
Senior diver one of
select few named
as Rhodes Scholar
nominees

highlight weekend

In diving, your performance
is based on two components: raw
score and degree of difficulty.
The first - the raw score -
is straightforward. The more
precise, athletic and clean
your dive is, the better your
evaluation will be.
The degree of difficulty, on
the other hand, takes more than
skill. Based on what type of
dive you choose, the degree of
difficulty serves as a multiplier
to the raw score and is based
solely off of how much you're
willing to challenge yourself.
In essence, the combination
of talent and the ability to
push yourself is the key to a
successful dive. Senior diver
Kevin Bain is familiar with this
concept, but his quest for a high
score expands beydnd the pool.
The business and comparative
literature major was recently
named one of Michigan's two
undergraduate Rhodes Scholar
nominees, and is now eager
to face his highest degree of
difficulty yet.

application requires five to
eight letters of endorsement
from professors and faculty, a
personal statement discussing
your life and ambitions, and
ultimately endorsements from
your university's provost and
your district's Rhodes Scholar
committee.
Last week, Bain received
Michigan Provost Martha
Pollack's endorsement, giving
him an opportunity to become
the 26th Rhodes Scholar in
University history.
Once the dust settles, 32
American students are selected
to pursue any study of their
choice at the University of
Oxford for at least two years.
Despite the opportunity, Bain
wasn't sure if he would be able to
pull it off while studying abroad
in Beijing for the summer.
"It's a very difficult
application and takes a lot of
time," Bain said. "I had to find
eight letters of recommendation
and write a personal statement
discussing my life and what I
want to accomplish. That meant
I had to Skype eight people
regularly with a 12-hour time
difference, which was very

difficult to pull off. ,
"But what pushed me to do
it was that, whenever I brought

years of
diving and
studying
business, time management has
become Bain's forte.
"We'll be 10 meters high,
standing on our hands with
our bodies shaking, trying to
convince our bodies that this
is a normal thing to do and that
we're going to survive," Bain
said. "In less than half a second,
we're going to be suspended in
the air doing flips and twisting
our bodies. After all that, we're

While diving especially
focuses on individual mental
strength, Bain believes every
sport builds special skills that
ready athletes forthe real world.
AmemberoftheStudent-Athlete
Ambassadors Committee, Bain
sees comparable work ethic in

every sport.
"It, takes up a lot of time,"
Bain said, "but if you can be
passionate about one thing, you
can be passionate about multiple
things. If you can push yourself
to get up at 5 a.m. to practice,
you can really push yourself to

"I might study a little more
and sleep a little less, butI don't
notice much .of a difference,
because we're all pushing

Now a nominee, Bain must
add preparing for the rigorous
finalist interviews in November
to his schedule. Seeking the
nation's best intellect, devotion
to duty and moral character, the
interviews require preparation
that Bain feels may take on a life
of its own.
"I'll be reading The

Bain said. "That'll definitely be

at Oxford. The
program contains advanced
elements of economics, social
anthropology and international
relations and can be tailored
toward cultural appropriation
and business development in
third-world Asia, Bain's end
goal.
"I want to find ways that

we can develop countries
and economies bottom-up
instead of top-down," Bain
said. "This means investing
in key industries sectors and
businesses while applying the
proper cultural framework
so we understand what their
culture will allow them to
accomplish and how they think
and operate.
"In doing so, we can help
them build an economy that
makes sense for them that they
can thrive in."
The degree of difficulty is
high, but as Bain embarks on his
journey ahead, he feels his time in
practice will pay off as he begins
to dive into real-world issues.

Bain said. "But I think I'm

Hoke's uncertain
future, team's
struggles hinder
recruiting efforts
By BEN FIDELMAN
Daily Sports Writer
After a third consecutive loss
Saturday, the Michigan football
team's chances of making a
bowl game are slim. With heads
hanging low in Ann Arbor,
perhaps it's time to look ahead
to future Wolverines.
Here's a rundown of how the
10 remaining committed high
school prospects fared this past
weekend.
Chris Clark, tight end: Avon
Old Farms (Conn.) vs. Cheshire
Academy (Conn.); Ranking:
ESPN (109) Scout (26)
After receiving his All-
American jersey Friday, Clark
announced Sunday on Twitter
that he will be taking official
visits elsewhere despite
his verbal commitment to
Michigan. Rivals.com reports
that first schools on the list are
USC and Texas.
Brian Cole, athlete:
Saginaw Heritage (Mich.) vs.
Flint Southwestern (Mich.);
Ranking: ESPN (139) Scout (39)
In his second game of the
season, Cole put up a modest
66 yards on 11 carries. His one
touchdown wasn't enough to
seal a victory for Heritage,
though, as it fell, 36-12,
droppingto 2-4 on the season.
Michael Weber, running
back: Cass Tech (Mich.) vs.
Detroit East English (Mich.);
Ranking: ESPN (169) Scout
(104)
*The featured running
back' ffom Michigan's 2015
recruiting class had a slight
decline following his 124-yard,
two-touchdown performance
last week. Weber posted 105
yards on 30 carries along with
two touchdowns in his team's
21-16 victory this week, helping
improve his team's' record to
6-0.
Tyree Kinnel, safety:
Wayne (Ohio) vs. Springfield
(Ohio); Ranking: ESPN (192)
Scout (152)
Highlighting Kinnel's
performance Friday night
was a kickoff return for a
touchdown to begin the second
half, blowing the game open.
Wayne won convincingly, 53-14,
moving to 6-0. Last week,
Kinnel told the Daily that he
would remain committed to
Michigan as long as Michigan
coach Brady oke and his staff
were part of the program.
Grant Newsome, offensive

tackle: The Lawrenceville
School (N.J.) at Episcopal
Academy (Pa.); Ranking: ESPN
(242) Scout (215)
Heading across state lines
for the second time this season,
Lawrenceville dropped a close
one, 35-28, falling to 1-3 in
2014. An encouraging stat came
from Newsome's offensive line,
which gouged the Episcopal
Academy defense for 35 points.
Episcopal Academy's defense
had previously allowed just 19
points per game through its first
five games.
Darrin Kirkland Jr.,
linebacker: Lawrence Central
(Ind.) vs. North Central (Ind.);
Ranking: ESPN (266) Scout
(114)
Returning two interceptions
for touchdowns, Kirkland
Jr. led his team in scoring as
it rolled over winless North
Central, 37-0. His touchdowns
helped lead the defense to a
statement performance after it
had been allowing an average of
34 points per game heading into
the weekend.
Alex Malzone,
quarterback: Brother Rice
(Mich.) vs. Orchard Lake St.
Mary's (Mich.); Ranking: ESPN
(NR) Scout (184)
Coming off of a record-
setting performance against
rival Detroit Catholic Central,
Malzone led his teamto a win in
another matchup of undefeated
teams. He threw for 419 yards
and four touchdowns, guiding
the Warriors to a 28-20 victory.
Malzone has passed for 18
touchdowns over five games
this season while throwing only
one interception.
Jon Runyan Jr., offensive
lineman: St. Joseph's Prep (Pa.)
at Malvern Prep (Pa.); Ranking:
(NR)
Working back toward a
.500 record, St. Joseph's won
this non-conference matchup,
49-28. This win came after
three consecutive losses, but
offense wasn't the problem in
any of those games, in which
the team averaged 24 points per
outing.
Andrew David, kicker:
Washington (Ohio) vs.
Austintown-Fitch - (Ohio);
Ranking: (NR)
Surrendering 14 fourth-
quarter points proved
detrimental to Washington's
quest to move to 6-0, as it fell,
34-33.
Garrett Taylor,
cornerback: St. Christopher's
(Va.); Ranking: ESPN (111) Scout
(268)
Taylor tore the anterior
cruciate ligament in his left
knee during offseason practice
and will miss the remainder of
the year.

FOOTBALL
"News bullets: Green out for season, Gardner No. 1 QB

By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
ManagingSportsEditor
At his press conference
Monday afternoon, Michigan
football coach Brady Hoke
discussed injuries, issues in
execution Saturday and more.
Green out for year
Sophomore running back
Derrick Green broke his clavicle
late in Saturday's loss to Rutgers
and will miss the rest of the
season, Hoke said.
The injury leaves sophomore
De'Veon Smith as Michigan's
top back, while redshirt junior
Justice Hayes and redshirt
sophomore Drake Johnson will
split backup duties.
"I'm highly confident of what
they bring and what they can do,"
Hoke said.
Green had been Michigan's top
back all season, and he rushed
for 471 yards at 5.7 yards per
carry. Against Rutgers, he ran 12
times for 74 yards in Michigan's
best offensive showing against a

Power S opponent this year.
This year, Johnson has just
three carries, while Hayes has 19.
Injury non-update
Hoke wouldn't comment on the
injury status of Smith, freshman
nickle back Jabrill Peppers,
or senior linebacker Desmond
Morgan.
Gardner No.1QB
Fifth-year senior Devin
Gardner remains Michigan'sNo.1.
quarterback ahead of Michigan's
game Saturday against Penn
State, Hoke said.
Sophomore quarterback
Shane Morris, who suffered a
"probable, mild concussion"
against Minnesota on Sept. 27,
has returned to practice.
Since Michigan only had
team meetings Sunday because
of the team's late arrival from
Piscataway, New Jersey, that
could mean Morris began
practicing last week.
Morris traveled with the team
to Piscataway and participated

in some pregame activities, but
he didn't play. Hoke wouldn't
confirm if the sophomore had
been cleared for game action.
Punt return woes
Early in the second quarter
of Michigan's game against the
Scarlet Knights, the Wolverines
had just 10 men on the field for a
Rutgers punt.
Thatcame after Michigan took
a defensive timeout when the
Scarlet Knights lined up in punt
formation on 4th-and-2.
According to Hoke, an
individual "didn't get that"
when the Wolverines sent out
their punt-return team after the
timeout.
Michigan also had 10 men on
the field when Utah returned a
punt for a touchdown Sept. 20.
"It's more coaching, and that's
on me," Hoke said. "We all need
to be locked in to doing a better
job."
Dennis Norfleet fielded the
punt inside the five-yard line and
returned it six yards.

TERESA MATHEW/Daily
Brady Hoke said to blame the coaches for Michigan's inability to get 11 menon the field for a punt return Saturday night.

'M' blasts U.S. NTDP Big gaffes on'D'worrisome

By ERIN LENNON
Daily Sports Writer
Last December, when the
U.S. Under-18 National Team
Development Program traveled
across town to play an exhibition
at Yost Ice
Arena, the US NTDP 4
Michigan MICHIGAN 7
hockey
team turned a two-goal lead
into an embarrassing overtime
loss. The breakdown took just 52
seconds and became a preview
of a regrettable month for ateam
with expectations of reaching
the NCAA Tournament.
So with memories of
devastation and the sour taste
of Saturday's season-opening
loss to Ferris State, this year's
Wolverines took pent-up
frustration out on the newest
class of NTDP players Monday
in their first home contest - a
7-4 victory.
"It feelsgood," said Michigan
coach Red Berenson. "We gave
the game away last year. With
two minutes to go, we changed
goalies to give our third goalie
a chance, and sure enough, they
score two goalsplus an overtime
goal. That didn't sit well.... This"
year, that didn't happen."
Despite an ominous first two
minutes, Michigan's offense
took command in the win.
Michigan's four starting U.S.
NTDP alums - sophomore
forward JT Compher,
sophomore forward Tyler
Motte, freshman forward
Dylan Larkin and freshman
defenseman Zach Werenski
- became the overwhelming
difference in the exhibition,
combining for seven points -
including five goals - against
their former teammates.
"Our offensive presence
was better today than you saw
Saturday," Motte said. "I think
this was a confidence builder for
our team hoving forward. It's
good to get back on the winning
side of a game like that."
Larkin, a first-round draft
pick of the Detroit Red Wings
and a stanpdou during his time
with the NTDP, netted two
rebound goals and finished his
first collegiate appearance at

Yost with three points.
"I had some chances at Ferris
State that I thought about the
night after that," Larkin said.
"It felt good to score."
In the third period, it took
the NTDP - which shut out
Miami (Ohio) 3-0 on Saturday
- just 16 seconds to score on
junior goaltender Steve Racine.
But as they had all game,
the Wolverines (0-1) had an
answer at the other end when
junior forward Justin Selman
connected for his first goal just
two minutes later. It was the
second straight game in which
Michigan got production from
its fourth line.
"I didn't like the fact that
we gave up the first goal again
tonight," Berenson said. "On the
other hand, I liked the way our
team just kept playing. We got
better as the game went on."
The Wolverines carried
two-goal advantages into the
first two intermissions, a feat
they couldn't claim at Ferris
State on Saturday. Though
a series of penalties on both
sides disrupted the tempo and

allowed the NTDP to threaten,
Michigan's offense answered
twice in the second frame to
push the lead to 5-3.
"(Special teams) are good to
work on in exhibitions like this,"
Motte said. "It kind of 9hps up
the game, but it's good to work
the kinks out. You saw a little bit
more production from the power
playtoday and we did some good
things on penalty kill as well, so
it's good to get thaton film."
While they managed just a
pair of shots through the first 10
minutes, the Wolverines scored
off their first two chances of
the contest. Motte found twine
moments after sophomore
forward Alex Kile's goal,
earning Michigan a one-point
advantage with 14:34 remaining
in the first frame.
Having trailed all three
periods Saturday, Compher's
late score off a faceoff allowed
the Wolverines to skate into
their first intermission with
their first lead of the season.
And despite some defensive
issues, Michigan eventually
coasted to a three-goal win.

Broken clavicle
sidelines Green,
leaves Smith as
featured back
By MAX COHEN
DailySportsEditor
The play couldn't have
been more promising for the
Michigan football team at the
time.- Sophomore running back
Derrick Green slashed through
the Rutgers defense for 21 yards,
advancing the ball to the Scarlet
Knights' 32-yard line.
The Wolverines were down
by nine, and the scamper led to
a rushing touchdown by fifth-
year senior quarterback Devin
Gardner that cut the deficit to
two. But the run came with
great cost. Toward the end of
the run, Green was hit as he
approached Michigan's sideline.
He didn't return to the game.
Monday, Michigan coach
Brady Hoke announced Green
had suffered a broken clavicle
and will miss the remainder of
the season.

Michigan career for Green. He
arrived in Ann Arbor a highly
ranked recruit, but was out of
shape and struggled to find room
behind a porous offensive line'
during his freshman year. This
season, he began to show signs
of why he was so highly touted
- most recently on the run in
which he was injured - but this
latest setback will inevitably
slow his development.
Through six games, Green
rushed for 471 yards and three
touchdowns on 82 attempts, a
marked improvement from his
270 yards on 83 carries in the
entirety of last season.
"We'll miss Derrick, but this is
like anything else in competition
in sports; the next man's got to
stand up," Hoke said.
With Green sidelined, the
burden of the Wolverines'
running game will fall to the
trio of sophomore De'Veon
Smith, redshirt junior Justice
Hayes and redshirt sophomore
Drake Johnson.
"I'm very confident in the
three guys that will be doing
most of the work as a running
back," Hoke

he will likely exceed with Green
out. Smith did appear to suffer
an injury late against Rutgers,
but Hoke wouldn't comment on
his status for Penn State.
If healthy, he's expected to be
the Wolverines' featured back.
"I think he's more than
capable of it," Hoke said.
Hayes, the team's primary
third-down back this season,
will also receive an increase in
touches. He has carried the ball
19 times this seasonfor101yards
and has yet to be heavily relied
upon for numerous arries in
his Michigan career. His 19
carries through six games this
year are the most he has had ina
single season.
Johnson, despite limited
work so far this season, will also
likely factor into the equation.
He has just three carries for
28 yards, all in Michigan's
blowout win over Appalachian
State on Aug. 30. He garnered
a great deal of praise in the
spring before the Wolverines'
2013 season, but a torn anterior
cruciate ligament suffered
in the season opener against
Central Michigan forced him to
miss the rest of the year.
"Drake is probably a
combination of somewhere with
Derrick and Justice as far as
when you see his ability and his
quickness in the hole," Hoke said.
Johnson also earned praise
before the current season, but
it didn't result in increased
playing time. Hoke said that
he's seen progression from
Johnson, but how much remains
unknown.
With Green out, so does much
of Michigan's running game.
