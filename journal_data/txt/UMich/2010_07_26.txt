New residence hall
opens in fall, will house
five 'U' departments
By CAITLIN HUSTON
Daily StaffReporter
With brand-new, technologi-
cally innovative classrooms, inter-
active study and lounge spaces and
an internationally focused cafete-
ria and residence hall, North Quad-
rangle is preparing for its grand
opening in the fall.

In an exclusive tour given to
the Michigan Daily, University offi-
cials showcased the 10-story resi-
dential building and seven-story
academic building, which comprise
North Quad. The residence hall
will feature state-of-the-art tech-
nology while supporting interna-
tional involvement and programs
for students. As the construction
progresses, four academic units
and the School of Information pre-
pare for their transition into North
Quad, bringing with them visions
of collaboration and new teaching
methods.
With student move-in on Sep. 3,

North Quad will house around 460
occupants - all of whom are soph-
omores, juniors and seniors - in its
residential building. The academic
building will contain the School of
Information, Department of Com-
munication Studies, Language
Resource Center, Sweetland Writ-
ing Center and the Department of
Screen Arts and Cultures, includ-
ing the Donald Hall Collection.
In the residential building, all
floors will be co-ed and will feature
a mixture of suite-style rooms and
single rooms. The dorm will also
feature central air conditioning, as

Mayoral candidates spar over issues

Hieftje, Lesko remain
tense in close race to
democratic primary
By DYLAN CINTI
Daily StaffReporter
Marked by heated disagreements
and personal accusations, Ann Arbor's
upcoming mayoral democratic prima-
ry continues to see its two candidates
remain neck and neck in the race.
The city's two democratic candi-.
dates - current mayor John Hieftje
and former local political blogger
Patricia Lesko - are vying for the may-
oral spot in the forthcoming Aug. 3
state primary elections.
According to a Jun. 4 poll conducted
by AnnArbor.com, local voter support
for Hieftje and Lesko is split at 44 per-
cent for each candidate. As the may-
oral race continues to heat up, the two
candidates have also leveraged accusa-
tions against one another.
Lesko used a recent public debate
to accuse mayor Hieftje, who's served
as mayor of Ann Arbor since 2000,
of questionable backroom dealings,
according to a Jul. 10 article by AnnAr-
bor.com.
"Has there been backroom dealing?
Absolutely," Lesko said in the article.
A visibly annoyed Hieftje respond-
ed by dismissing Lesko's comments as
"conspiracy theories," the AnnArbor.
com article reported.

The heatednature of the debate may
have come as a surprise to some, but
current Ann Arbor city councilmem-
ber Mike Anglin (D-Ward 5) said it's
nothing new for Lesko.
"Pat's very sincere in what she's
talking about," Anglin said on Sunday
in an interview with The Michigan
Daily. "She's a humorous person. And
she can be argumentative."
That argumentative streak began
last August when Lesko began blog-
ging about city politics under the alias
"Sam Rosenthal." Her blog - a2po-
litico.com - criticized Hieftje for
what she considered his lack of fiscal
responsibility and disregard for key
public services.
In a Jan. 13 post, Lesko said, "By
2008, I would have voted for Satan if
he'd have run against our mayor."
Instead, she decided to start her
own campaign.
Lesko said her campaign centers on
what she calls a "return to the basics."
According to Lesko, this means focus-
ing more on core services the city pro-
vides - like police, firefighters and
public parks.
"The city's infrastructure isn't being
tended to," Lesko said.
However, Hieftje's supporters argue
that he has a firm grasp on city infra-
structure and is doing the best work he
can inan economic downturn.
Current councilmember Chris-
topher Taylor (D-Ward 3), one of
Hieftje's vocal supporters, said he
thinks Lesko is unfairly using the long

economic recession against Hieftje.
"The city budget ... has experienced
substantial losses," Taylor said in an
interview with the Daily on Sunday.
"One must consider one's success based
on (available) opportunities. (Hieftje)
has led city council to cut expenses ...
without material impact on services."
Hieftje - who could not immedi-
ately be reached for comment - states
on his reelection website that he will
"ensure that our City continues to
invest in infrastructure" and "main-
tain focus on providing high-quality
core City services." According to
councilmember Taylor, nearly every
current councilmember is likely to
support Hieftje.
At the moment, Mike Anglin is the
sole councilmember publicly backing
Lesko.
Anglin said he's inspired by what
he considers her honesty and commit-
ment to direct communication.

Patricia Lesko is the democratic challenger.
"She's honest in what she believes,"
Anglin said. "She puts herself out

Putting herself "out there" is a risk
Lesko said she's willing to take as part
of her goal to expand and encourage
citywide communication.
"Have no fear - the A2Politico will
be inside city hall," Lesko said.

MSU-based company first tenant of NCRC

BoroPharm acquires
specialized lab space,
recruits 'U' talent
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Almost a year after the University
purchased the property, the research
space at the new North Campus
Research Complex no longer exists
unoccupied.
BoroPharm - a chemical manu-
facturing company founded by two
Michigan State University faculty
members - is the first entity to occu-
py laboratory space in the 174-acre,
28-building former Pfizer complex,
as well as its first commercial tenant.
Founded in 2005 by Rob Malec-
zka and Mitch Smith, BoroPharm

develops and manufactures chemical
intermediates - specifically boron-
based compounds - for the pharma-
ceutical, agro-tech and fine chemical
industries. The intermediates are
more efficient and environmentally
friendly than other similar products.
Todd Zahn, president and CEO of
BoroPharm, said there are a number
of practical applications for the com-
pounds his company creates.
"(The compounds) are used in a
variety of different applications,"
Zahn said. "All the way down from
pharmaceuticals through to organic
lighting, electronics and things like
that."
The company first moved into its
4,300-square-foot, free-standing
building on the NCRC campus last
March and will be fully operational
in the space in a matter of weeks,
Zahn said.

The building was deliberately built
away from the rest of the structures
at the NCRC because its laborato-
ries handle high-pressure chemistry
reactions that have the potential to
explode, NCRC Executive Director
David Canter said during a media
tour of the complex last week.
Joan Keiser, the outgoing inter-
im NCRC executive director, said
BoroPharm contacted the Univer-
sity about renting the lab space even
before it had bought the NCRC from
Pfizer. Once the University owned
the property, it determined that it
had no need for the specialized labo-
ratories and decided to rent out the
space to BoroPharm.
"BoroPharm contacted the Uni-
versity of Michigan very early on
because these types of facilities are
not usual and BoroPharm was aware
that it was here (because) the chemi-

cal industry (as a whole) is aware that
we have a facility like this," Keiser
said. "They contacted the University
early to ask, 'Was there space? Was
there space?' They were very per-
sistent. I give them great credit for
that."
The exceptional facilities were not
the only reason BoroPharm decided
to move to Ann Arbor. The resources
available to it because of its relation-
ship with the University were also
strong motivators for BoroPharm to
make the move, Zahn said.
"We were really interested in both
the facilities and the access to the tal-
ent that is at the University in terms
of faculty collaborations and training
students and bringing out new com-
mercial opportunities where students
can enhance their learning experi-
ence and educational experience at

well as wireless Internet access.
At the top of the residential build-
ing, the "Tower Room" will feature
community programs and activities, as
well as a kitchen designated for special
dinners for residents.
University Housing Spokesman
Peter Logan said he thinks residents
living in North Quad will have a dif-
ferent experience from those living in
other dorms.
"Living in North Quad is going to
be unique in that it will be a residential
facility co-located with academic pro-
grams and offices with an overarching
focus on an awareness of international
issues and cultures in an effort to bring
about stronger competency as global
citizens," Logan said.
The dormitory will house resi-
dents in the Global Scholars Program,
a living-learning community formerly
based in East Quadrangle, on the
fourth floor and the Max Kade com-
munity - previously in the Vera Baits
houses - on half of the fifth floor.
Logan added that the dormitory,
as well as some of the collaborative
spaces between the residence hall and
the academic building, will host inter-
national programming, which could
include community programs about
a specific country, art exhibitions,
opportunities to work with different
academic units and video conferencing

with other parts of the world.
Logan said he feels that this pro-
gramming as well as the residents'
interactions with the academic units in
the building will generate a vital edu-
cational experience.
"It's going to be really exciting
that this building, more than any-
where else, articulates (University
President Mary Sue Coleman's) vision
that we need to strengthen that con-
nection between living and learning,"
he said.
North Quad will also hold a caf-
eteria, which Logan said will feature
international cuisine, as well as tradi-
tional American food. Logan said he
believes dorm residents, faculty and
staff, will want to eat at the cafeteria
as well as students from across cam-
pus.
In an e-mail to the Daily, Logan
wrote that the dorm will also be energy
efficient with occupancy sensor lights
in the residential hallways, bathrooms
and classrooms, water conservation
methods in the plumbing and controls
to turn-off air flow in unoccupied con-
ference rooms.
Though some collaborative spaces
between the academic and residential
sides of the building and other areas
of the academic building will still be
under construction in the fall, Logan
said the dormitory will be completed
for student move-in.
"We're confident that the resi-
dent hall is going to be set and ready
to go when the students start moving

in," he said.
Because North Quad encompasses
both academic spaces and a dormitory,
Jamie Lausch, the North Quad Pro-
gram Coordinator, said she was hired
to facilitate the interactions between
the different programs in the common
spaces of the building.
During the exclusive tour of North
Quad, Lausch said one of those spaces
- the Media Gateway - will include
a lounge with television sets display-
ing advertisements, student work and
public service announcements. The
space also features alcoves with chalk-
board walls and team rooms below the
lounge, which any University student
will be able to reserve online.
The other common space, which
has not yet been given a name, is still
under construction and is not slated
to be finished when the dorm opens.
As this area facing State Street is still
under development, Lausch said the
space may be used as a public gather-
ing place and may feature MHealthy
classes or host receptions and gather-
ings. Lausch also said she is working
with the SAC department on this proj-
ect.
As the residential building pre-
pares for the incoming students, some
academic units of the building have
already begun moving in.
With part of the School of Infor-
mation's move to the building last
Monday, Dean of SI Jeffrey MacKie-
Mason said he is excited about the
range of new technologies that the

school will have in the building. These
include life-size, high-definition
uncompressed video conferencing and
wireless video camera systems in the
classrooms, MacKie-Mason said.
MacKie-Mason added that he is
looking forward to having the school's
doctoral and master students - previ-
ously split between North and Cen-
tral campuses - together in the same
place. The North Campus component
of the department will be moving to
North Quad in October.
MacKie-Mason said the other
advantage of North Quad is the poten-
tial to work with the Department of
Communication Studies as well as the
Sweetland Writing Center and the
Department of Screen Arts and Cul-
tures.
"We're all units that deal in vari-
ous ways with media and information
and communications, and we have
a lot of common interests and a lot of
overlap in both teaching and research
objectives," he said. "We haven't been
able to interact very much in the past,
because we've been scattered across
campus, so we're really looking for-
ward to interacting with the units. It's
like a digital life playground around
here."
Danielle Peters, Senior Infor-
mation Assistant at the Language
Resource Center, said the center is also
excited to move into North Quad on
Aug. 6 and to work with the different
departments in the building.
The LRC will also expand its sat-

ellite television offerings in the fall,
so that anyone can bring a laptop into
North Quad and watch satellite TV
over an IP web address, Peters said.
The LRC is working with the Univer-
sity to make this offering campus-wide
in the future.
With a move-in date of Sep. 1, Phil
Hallman, the Donald Hall Collection
Librarian, said he hopes that the move
from E. Liberty to North Quad can
help the library - which houses over
20,000 DVDs, screenplays, books and
an archival print collection as part of
the SAC department - become more
recognized on campus.
"We're sort of an unknown library
for the most part for campus, so hope-
fully we'll be a little more known in the
North Quad building," Hallman said.
The Sweetland Writing Center
will also be open in North Quad on Jul.
28, though its peer-tutoring centerwill
remain in Angell Hall.

Buildin a new economy
High-tech industries are vital to Michigan's future
F orget Silicon Valley - Michigan is poised to become the powerhouse
peninsulas of high-tech innovation and manufacturing. According
to a recent report by Anderson Economic Group, Michigan experi-
enced impressive growth from 2003-2007 in the advanced manufacturing
sector. But while this growth is indeed encouraging, the state's develop-
ment as a high-tech hub is being stifled by Lansing's misguided funding
priorities and poor economic management. In order to place the state back
on the path to prosperity, lawmakers should enact policies that will encour-
age high-tech companies to lay down roots in Michigan.

I have lived in Michigan my entire
life, and I've seen the good, the bad
and the ugly. In recent years, how-
ever, it's been downright repulsive.
I have grown to love Michigan and
want to stay here, but, given the,
state's current job market, I'm not so
sure I'll be able to. The only way to
ensure that I can do so is by voting in
a new leader that can create jobs and
turn our economy around.
And that is why I am voting for Rick
Snyder for Michigan's next governor.
Michigan's appeal has declined
considerably in recent years. Until
recently, the state has had the highest
unemployment rate of any state, hov-
ering around 5% above the national
average. In the last 10 years, Michi-
gan has lost over one million jobs.
When there are thriving cities with-
in five hours of my home, it doesn't
make sense for me to stay here. Chi-
cago, for example, is both reasonably
close and home to over 70,000 recent
Michigan State University and Uni-
versity of Michigan alumni. As a
University senior, the exciting urban
lifestyle of Chicago seems like a very
attractive option for me within the
next two years unless drastic change -
occurs in the Detroit ores.
Having all but lost hope in the state
in which I grew up, I started looking
into who is running to turn around
this giant financial blunder. Many
people who have been working their
entire lives have lost their jobs, and
the youth who choose to stay here
are thrust into an empty job market.
Without a major spurt of job creation
in the coming years, Michigan's eco-
nomic fate is doomed. Of the seven
candidates running for governor,
only one caught my attention with
a long-term plan to turn around our
economy: Republican Rick Snyder.
When I learned that Rick Snyder

was both a businessman and venture
capitalist who has made a career out
of creating jobs, I knew he should be
our next governor. His plans to make
Michigan more business-friendly
and to attract more high-tech jobs to
the state are exactly what we need
to turn.Michigan around. We're past
the time when we can depend on the
auto industry - there's simply too
much foreign competition. It's time
to move on to a new chapter, one in
which education and technology will
play a vital role.
Without major changes in our
political leadership, Michigan's econ-
omy won't recover, the population
will continue to fall and the vital-
ity of this great state will dwindle to
nothingness. Career politicians have
taught us again and again that they're
not to be trusted. Detroit's recent fias-
co with Kwame Kilpatrick highlights
the need for ethics and transparency
in government. With Rick Snyder as
governor, everything the government
does will be readily available for pub-
lic review and the government will be
much more citizen-friendly.
Rick Snyder is the best candidate
to reverse the consequences of this
economic recession. He has a vision
and a plan to run a results-oriented
government, as opposed to having
our legislators discuss the legality of
fireworks when we are in the middle
of an economic disaster. Instead of
putting a bandage on the problem to
"fix" Michigan, he wants to take our
state and reinvent it. He's a proven
job creator with a vision and a plan
to turn this state around - and give
me a reason to continue living in the
state I love.
Josh Arocho is an LSA senior.
He is currently an intern for Rick
Snyder's gubernatoria' campaign.

Commissioned by the Uni-
versity Research Corridor - a
partnership between the Univer-
sity of Michigan, Michigan State
University and Wayne State Uni-
versity - AEG's report found
that almost 400,000 Michi-
gan residents are employed by
approximately 11,000 advanced
manufacturing companies. More-
over, from 2003 to 2007, the most
recent data available, wages in
this industry grew by 12 percent
to become $23,000 higher than
workers in other fields.
Michigan's lesson from its
long-standing economic decline
is clear: The state desperately
needs a more diversified econo-
my. Michigan can't thrive when
its fortunes are inexorably tied
to the success of the auto indus-
try, the heyday of which ended
decades ago. The best hope for
the state's prosperity is a diverse
and modern economy based on
the ability to think and innovate.
That means that Michigan can't

just make things; it needs to be
the nucleus for the nation's devel-
opment of better things.
And the University Research
Corridor is an essential resource
driving the state along that path.
Michigan's public universities are
producing a skilled labor force,
planting the seeds of innovation
among the next generation of
job-creating entrepreneurs. The
advanced manufacturing growth
Michigan has seen is a tangible
result of university research, not
to mention another reminder to
the legislature of the importance
of its underfunded universities.
Yet the recent growth should
also remind those in Lansing
that Michigan is in an unrivaled
position to take the lead in com-
mercializing new technologies.
Complementing its strong uni-
versities, the state hasalarge pool
of currently unemployed laborers
trained for the manufacturing
sector along with wide swaths
of unused factories and ware-

houses. But the state government
needs to actively connect these
resources with nascent indus-
tries. Funding should be restored
to the No Worker Left Behind
program so that workers can be
retrained to meet the needs of
these growing companies. Tax
incentives should be expanded to
attract and keep innovative busi-
nesses in the state. And the state
should invest far more in the
URC, one of its most important
tools for economic growth and
the birthplace of the next genera-
tion of technologies.
Economic recovery won't
happen by cutting investment
in its primary mechanisms for
economic growth. Long-term,
sustainable prosperity requires
an equally long-term dedication
to the people and organizations
that energize Michigan's econ-
omy. Only with such unwaver-
ing commitment can Michigan
shake off the rust and prosper in
a new century.

The general view of the Afghans is that the current
government is worst (sic) than the Taliban."

Breaking the big city silence

She is a she. It doesn't change
what she feels. She can
imagine, in the throes of a
vivid daydream,
the anguish
and worry of
an unexpected
pregnancy, even
if others might"
say that she's so
sheltered and
naive she can't ANNA
possibly imagine PAONE
it. She's a college
student, after all, and she knows
how complicated it would get
were she to unexpectedly expect.
And beyond that, she wants to act,
and she has heard of actresses
lined up for lucrative roles who
were forced to forfeit them after
they become pregnant.
She also knows many brilliant
men who hold the same ideals, and
she feels the pain they brush off
when opponents disregard their
opinion because of their gender. But
she has no problem being one of the
many intelligent female faces of the
pro-life movement. This is the path
she has chosen.
There's that word again -
choice. In a way, she did not have
any herself, because if she did she
surely would go for a less contro-
versial position. She was under the
impression that it didn't matter
how many people hated her. But
she discovered that it's a whole lot
harder than it looks, especially in
the halls of academia she inhabits.
She has a terrible foreboding that
any future potential employer will
Google her and find her published
pro-life statements, photos of her
at rallies and breakfasts, and revoke
the kindly hand of hiring.
But she can't stop. It's her own
little inside joke now because she,
too, won't cease her oft-maligned
activities. She has read through sci-
entific studies and philosophy, she
has reflected on it herself as people
on both sides always encourage
one another to do and she has seen
the pictures and videos. But shock
value was not what got her. Reason
was what got her, along with the
belief that there is a prevailing mor-
ally correct answer no matter what
the circumstance.
Okay - yes, she's "religious."
She's Catholic, naturally. But like
nearly every other young Catholic
in America today, there was a time
when she was not so pious. It was
a time when the unpopular social
teachings of Rome didn't seem
worth the strain that would come
with defending them. But then she
circumnavigated her way back both

liturgically and hagiographically -
the saints, the tradition, the beauty
and the truth of the path to holiness
called her back. Eventually she fig-
ured out that she could and would
understand the social teaching. But
that's not what turned her into the
"dreaded" pro-lifer.
It wasn't shock
value that got her.
It was reason.
Of course, the pro-life move-
ment is always figuring out how
much, if any, emphasis it should put
on its religious roots. She could be
of the mind that it cannot abandon
its Christian supporters and those
of other faiths - that encouraging
a more secular attitude is tanta-
mount to a minor apostasy. Or she
could believe that Bible verses on
protest signs and ostentatious dis-
plays of prayer will merely alienate
the people they are trying to help.
She is inclined to hold to the lat-
ter, but it's too blurry a picture to
say for certain if the girl is just one
person, or if she is representative
of most pro-lifers.
For she is not a clinic bomber.
She can be a fiery speaker, but she
does not attack. She knows that
such actions are contrary to the
argument that life is the greatest
good, and she's mortified when
misguided people wreak destruc-
tion and give the other side a reason
to believe that they are not in it for
the right reasons.
Because they are - the major-
ity of them, at least. She knows
those who disagree will read over
her story, listen to her debate and
walk away disgusted for whatever
reason. She knows anger at her
stance will blind many to the point
where they will not investigate its
many erudite defenses. She consid-
ers herself a pro-life feminist, but
she knows that many equate such
a person with the Tooth Fairy or,
amongst atheists, with God. (For
that matter, she would likely side
with a pro-life atheist over a pro-
choice Catholic.) She is going to be
a filmmaker some day, and maybe
a novelist too, if she doesn't allow
opposition to beat her down first.
But even if it does, it's still not
about her. It's about babies, people
and dignity.

've spent a bit of time in New
York recently, and it is here that
I discovered the pleasure of big
city anonymity.
Walking through
these streets, "
heading toward a
farmers' market or
a free theater per-
formance, I can be
sure that I'm just CAROLYN
part of a crowd, C H
indistinguishable LUSCH
in the memories
of passers-by from the hundreds of
other citizens on the sidewalks. If
I do something embarrassing, like
trip on a jagged bit of concrete or
get stuck in
the closing
subway doors,
people will
glance for a
moment and
forget my face.
These pedes-
trians have
destinations I
couldn't guess,
and I'll prob-
ably never see
them again.
I've gained a:
funny story,n
and, at most, EmailBruno at brunors@
I've lost only a
few seconds of dignity.
I thought about this again when a
friend showed me a YouTube video
of Improv Everywhere, a zany theat-
rical group who in this case invaded
that same subway system and staged
a reenactment of Princess Leia's cap-
ture by the Empire from "Star Wars."
I watched the actress' face as she
sat in her white robe and sticky bun
hairdo, ignoring the puzzled stares of
the other passengers. She didn't care
one bit about what they thought of
her. At that moment, she didn't have
a name or a definable face. She was
playing a part, and later that evening,
she'd go back to her apartment, take
down her hair, eat a bowl of cereal
and watch the news. And above all,
she would not have lost anything.
Now, imagine that happening on
a Bursley-Baits bus. Ann Arbor is a
city where you can run into people
you know every time you leave your
home. Yet people frequently engage
in acts that impact the general pub-

lic. Just think of all of the drum-
mers and preachers on the Diag, the
people who run into classrooms and
give out candy, the young men who
sit outside Espresso Royale collect-
ing stories, the people who invaded
the fishbowl to play live Pac Man
and nearly gave me a panic attack
my freshman year.
I've always wondered what causes
people to do this. I've only taken
part in public acts once or twice, and
they weren't positive experiences.
An organization once compelled
me to go bucketing, which entails
standing on a street corner and ask-
ing passers-by for money to support
good causes. I could barely stand the
c

but in the end, the interaction is
about one party profiting from the
other. The only kinds of public acts
that strike me as worth the stress
and potential humiliation are ones
with the end of creating connections
between people.
It takes courage to break out of
the anonymity afforded by a city
and actually pursue personal rela-
tionships. It requires granting
some basic trust to a broad section
of humanity. So many times - in
Ann Arbor, New York, Detroit or
any other big city - I've seen the
individuals milling around me
and wanted badly to connect with
them. The man over there is reading
artonbyBSrunostortini my favorite
author. The
girl walking
toward me
has such a
look of con-
fidence and
peace. The
grandmother-
ly figure on
the bench is

to herself.
The stories

me, but they
seem so inac-
cessible.

few hours I put in. I knew that no
one would think much about it after
they passed me, and I knew that the
money was goingto legitimately help
people in need. Yet I watched the
oncoming traffic anxiously, terrified
that someone I knew and respected
would walk by. Given the choice, I'd
rather have New York subway doors
close on me over and over again.
It takes courage
to break out of big
city anonymity.
On the other hand, I don't think
I'd mind sitting on the street and
asking people for their stories.
Approaching people for their finan-
cial contributions, religious convic-
tions or political support has a place,

A certain young woman I met on
the subway made that effort of kin-
ship, ignored the norm of New York
commuter apathy and, instead of
averting her eyes, started talking to
me. As we clutched the backs of seats
and swayed with the rattling of the
car, she told me her story of coming
to the city and the challenges she'd
encountered. We discovered we
were both from the Midwest, thatwe
both went to big public universities
and that neither of us cared about
football. We laughed in the middle of
an otherwise silent train.
If she can do this as a lonely new-
comer in the biggest city in the coun-
try, I must be able to do much more
as a comfortable resident of a small,
friendly city like Ann Arbor. People
pass by on the sidewalk every day,
and that makes for a lot of stories I
have yet to hear.

NEGOTIATIONS
From Page 1
weekend that LEO notified Univer-
sity administrators that negotiations
would slow inthe summerbefore con-
tract negotiations ever began.
"We told the administration back
in October that we really should have
the contract by the end of April," Hal-
loran said, explaining that the lec-
turers' bargaining team is made up
of volunteers who often have other
commitments during the summer.
"They knew from October that this
was going to be a problem for us and
they're expressing a lot of unhappi-
ness but this is exactly what we told
them would happen."
Halloran said it is also difficult for
members of the bargaining team to
communicate with LEO members dur-

ing the summer, which can also cause
some delays in the process.
"We function as a democratic
organization and while we invest our
bargaining team with the authority to
bargain at the table, they don't have
absolute authority and they need to
have feedback from the membership
on what's going on in terms of what's
okay and what's not," Halloran contin-
ued. "We can't have our full team there
and that's a problem for us."
Asked for her response on the Uni-
versity's action to bring in a mediator,
Halloran said LEO bargainers are ded-
icated to the ongoing negotiations and
are hopeful that a mutually acceptable
resolution can be reached.
"We knew this was a possibility.
It's a part of the process of negotiating
contracts," Halloran said of the media-
tor. "It's something we haven't done
before, but it's one of the options in the

process and we're fully, 100 percent
committed to this process of media-
tion and we think through the process
there's the possibility of coming to
some kind of agreement."
However, Halloran added that
LEO bargainers continue to also be
dedicated to the cause of University
lecturers.
"At the same time, we're still com-
mitted to our goals for our members,"
Halloran said. "We'll be working
through mediation in order to get to
the goals that our members expressed
through our own internal process."
In a statement released to the Daily
late last week, a representative from
the University's Office of Public Affairs
wrote that University officials also
remain optimistic that a resolution can
be reached through mediation.
"While mediation is a non-binding
process, the University is hopeful that

a mediator will be able to bring both
sides to the table so they may reach
a mutually agreeable resolution that
allows all parties to direct their atten-
tion to preparing for the fall term," the
statement said.
According to a University human
resources website, the two parties
have reached tentative agreements on
seven issues - six the result of the Uni-
versity's acceptance of LEO's proposal
and one the result of LEO's acceptance
of the University's proposal.
However, according to the web-
site, seven issues remain on the table
- including key debates over compen-
sation and benefits.
"In terms of the annual raises,
we're pretty close to each other. In
terms of the benefits offset, we're
also getting closer," Halloran told the
Daily. "But in other parts of the salary
package, we're still far apart."

One such area that Halloran said
the two parties remain divided on is
pay equity for lecturers.
"We're paid something like
$15,000 less than high school teach-
ers, we're paid something like that less
than the tenured faculty also," Hallor-
an said. "We know that's not a salary
that a family can live on.
"We play a really important role
in the University, but we're drasti-
cally underpaid for our educational
background and for the service we
provide for the University," Halloran
continued. "We don't want to be paid
the same thing as tenure track faculty,
but we want to close the gap somewhat
so that our salaries enable us to live a
middle class life and support a family
with two children."
The two parties are set to meet
again with the mediator at the bar-
gaining table on Aug. 3.

the University," Zahn said.
University President Mary Sue
Coleman, in an interview last week,
said BoroPharm would be a boon to
the University. Coleman added that
BoroPharm's presence at the Univer-
1 sity would provide unique education-
al opportunities to students.

"We have a robust opportunity
here not only to have a partnership
with technologies that are com-
ing out of the University, but that
we could attract companies that are
small, that are growing, that make
sense from a research perspective,"
Coleman said. "There would be a
good interaction, a good possibility
for internships for students."
Coleman added that the company's

profitability was another reason the
University was attracted to Boro-
Pharm.
"The reason we like (BoroPharm)
as our initial tenant is because they
actually sell product," Coleman
said with a chuckle. "They're mak-
ing a profit right now. A lot of these
start-up companies go a long time
before making a product that can
be sold."

officials from both the University
and BoroPharm emphasized how the
business relationship was an exam-
ple of the success of the University
Research Corridor - a research part-
nership between the University of
Michigan, Michigan State University
and Wayne State University.
Zahn said the transition between
Michigan State University and the
University of Michigan has been

"awesome."
"We still utilize Michigan State
space and resources," he said. "Our
relationship is still very strong there.
We still have many collaborations
going on. We've had a very good
experience, similarly, like we did at
Michigan State. We've had an excel-
lent experience with the Univer-
sity of Michigan administrators and
faculty."

Babe character could deliver. needs a sense of humor; unfortunately,
ugh the film toils in generic, "Salt" forgoes it entirely for a false sense
:ic irrelevance, Jolie's perfor- of worldly importance. International

diplomacy is serious business, and if
maintaining it means killing lots of uni-
formed dudes, well, there's nothing to
smile about, mister. People are dying
out there - people whose names you'll
never know and whose faces you'll
barely see and whose Vaudevillian
accents belie their true nefarious colors.
Director Phillip Noyce is best known
for his Jack Ryan political thrillers
"Patriot Games" and "Clear and Pres-
ent Danger." Besides their protagcs-
nist, the two films share in common a
lot of exposition, steady camerawork
and early 1990s release dates. So while
his experience in chasing diplomatic
intrigue remains stable, Noyce is, sadly,
old. And his movie reflects his age.
Every chase, every fistfight, every set
piece, every line of dialogue is so famil-
iar and so reheated that the film feels
like it was constructed entirely from
chunks of other, better action films that
already exist. The trick where villains
greet each other in a foreign language
but find an excuse to hold their conver-
sation in English, for example, is scat-
tered all throughout "Salt." But Jolie
does her best to salvage some ingenuity.
Where the film shines is in Salt's

"I'm gonna kil Tom Cruise for making me do t
martial prowess. It does a great ser-
vice to Jolie's credibility and indeed the
credibility of heroines in general that
not one quip about Salt's sex is uttered.
Never does Salt feel a sudden urge to
take a long steamy shower, nor does
she seduce a clueless security guard for
the keys to his handcuffs. She can kill
people, evade capture and leap between
moving vehicles like any James Bond

Michael Moore partners with
SAC students and faculty for
Traverse City Film Festival
By ANDREW LAPIN
Editor in Chief
In late July 2009, Screen Arts and Cultures pro-
fessor Jim Burnstein was at the annual Traverse
City Film Festival in northern Michigan with
students from his advanced film production class.
Burnstein, the coordinator of the Screenwriting
Department, had convinced the festival's founder,
Oscar-winning documentarian Michael Moore,
to screen the students' films alongside the event's
normal big-name theatrical fare.
Burnstein had also taught an introductory
course in screenwriting for festival patrons. His
involvement, along with that of his students, was
supposed to be a one-time thing. But Moore had
other ideas.
"He said to me, 'So we'll do this every year,
right?' " recalled Burnstein of his companion on
the Michigan Film Office Advisory Council. "And I
said, 'Sure, great.' I mean, that was our hope."
One year later, Burnstein and his students are
coming back - and then some. This year the Tra-
verse City Film Festival, which is being held from
July 27 through August 1, announced a special
partnership with the University that will dra-
matically increase the presence of students and
faculty at one of the biggest film festivals in the
Midwest.
"This is one of the great universities in the
world, and I think that the people there don't want
it to exist within a bubble," Moore said in an inter-
view with the Daily. "It needs to be part of the
greater community, at the very least in the state of
Michigan."

The "Fahrenheit 9/11" director noted he was
excited by the promise of the partnership.
"I think this is the beginning of a long-term rela-
tionship, and I say this as a Spartan fan," he joked.
Two student short films from last semester's
SAC 423 class ("Practicum for the Screenwriter")
will be screened at the festival: "Camp Chapel,"
written by recent LSA and Ross School of Busi-
ness graduate Michael Burke and directed by LSA
senior Bhanu Chundu, and "Margaret and Izzey,"
written by recent LSA graduate Erin Whittemore
and directed by LSA senior Ben Ellmann.
In addition, Burnstein will be bringing a group
of SAC faculty members to serve as judges, host
panels on topics like film literacy, teach classes and
moderate film screenings.
Though the student films received an auto-bid
into the festival, Moore, who watches every one of
the over 400 festival submissions himself, wasn't
as lenient on American independent films this year.
"Fewer ones are being made, fewer good ones
are being made," he said. "I think we need your
generation to make the next great batch of movies
and to take this art form into the 21st century."
That generation, as represented by SAC 423
screenwriters Burke and Whittemore, is ready if
nervous to take its hard work to Traverse City.
"We can't have (the films) be awful and not be
invited to Traverse City next year," Burke said. Yet
he and Whittemore amiably postulated what they
would like to walk away from the festival with.
"Best-case scenario, I think, is we both have
agents, managers and have sold our scripts for six,
seven figures," he said. "Realistically, I would love
to get-"
"An e-mail," Whittemore finished, laughing.
But no matter the outcome of the festival, for a
few days this week by the shores of the Grand Tra-
verse Bay, the University of Michigan will step into
the film industry spotlight.

"Oh I hate Katy Perry so much, you do not
represent California girls, bitch."
Golden State native Bethany Cosentino's
tweet about Perry's recent
chart-topper underscores **
the inspiration behind
Best Coast's Crazy for You. Best Coast
Instead of embracing the
"I Kissed A Girl" song- Crazy For You
stress's Barbiesque vision of Mexican Summer
1990s Californian summer
fun, Crazy for You harkens back to the more
demure 1960s. Think Annette Funicello in
"Beach Blanket Bingo," not Shannen Doherty
in "90210."
Crazy for You is a study in Brill Building
cliche: The album tirelessly replicates the
multitracked cooing, handclaps and jangly
tambourine of that label's girl groups. The
warm fuzzy drone is appealing in moderation
- opener "Boyfriend" is a standout. But while
lead singer and songwriter Cosentino (one
half of Best Coast, along with instrumentalist
Bobb Bruno) has a strong voice, her attempts
to emulate Connie Francis's blandly wistful
phrasing seem inorganic. As a whole, Crazyfor
You apes the warmth of 1960s pop a little too
faithfully, making the sound less a reference
than a direct ripoff.
The album's subject matter is similarly nar-
row: Crazyfor You provides a 35-minute rumi-
nation on boys with a few brief mentions of
weed and cats. While the sexism of the record's
reference points can be partly attributed to
1960s gender norms, Cosentino's unwaver-
ing, obsessive devotion to an unnamed male
seems uncomfortably dated in 2010. Each half-

formed song blends into the next, and simplis-
tic lyrics reminiscent of a mopey 17-year-old
("I can't get myself off the couch / I don't want
to talk to anyone else") don't make it any easi-
er to distinguish tracks. The affected childish-
ness quickly wears thin, invoking memories of
Kimya Dawson's "Juno" soundtrack.
Crazy for You is textbook beach pop - its
perma-sunny sound is a suitable soundtrack
for dog days of summer-induced ennui. The
album, however, seems like a disingenuous
attempt to maintain Best Coast's sloppy to-fi
aesthetic. As Cosentino's fame increases, the
"lovelorn nobody" conceit rings false: A recent
collaboration with the decidedly middle-of-
the-road rapper Kid Cudi for Converse and an
aggressively public relationship with fellow
beach enthusiast Nathan Williams (Wavves)
illustrate that she's far from anonymous.
'Crazy' is formulaic
beachy girl angst.
While Crazy for You isn't a radical depar-
ture from Best Coast's past work, it seems
possible that several of its singles could find
crossover success. While the repetitiveness
grows grating by album's end, Costenino has a
gift with a pop hook evident even when buried
under layers of reverb: Closing track "When
I'm With You" is agem. Crazyfor You isn't des-
tined for beach immorality like Surfin' USA or
All Summer Long, but it'll undoubtedly make
the August playlists of Urban Outfitters and
Starbucks locations from the east to the west
coast.

SnPr e e Offensive Line
Season rev iewl

0-line set to have significant impact on'M'

By RYAN KARTJE
ManagingEditor
For junior center David Molk, this
year might feel a little bit like a second
chance. Before last season, Molk was
widely considered one of, if not the
best, interior linemen in the Big Ten.
And through the Wolverines' first
three games, Molk's presence was
felt immensely as Michigan's running
game played huge parts in its four
wins to start the year.
And it was no coincidence that
when Molk went down with a broken

foot against Eastern Michigan, the
Michigan football run-game fell sig-
nificantly after that.
At full health, Molk and the Michi-
gan running game was accumulating
rush yards at a clip of about 270 yards
per game. And excluding the team's
blowout over FCS opponent Delaware
State, runners averaged 150 yards
less with Molk out of the lineup. So
as Molk went down with an ACL tear
against Penn State - effectively end-
ing his season - it was pretty clear
that the Wolverines' chances on the
ground were pretty shot as well.

But this year, with a handful
of capable running backs, Molk is
healthy again and will take the reins
of an offensive line that could keep
Michigan in games this fall.
Alongside Molk will be senior and
offensive leader Stephen Schilling,
who has been described by many as
one of the Wolverines most important
assets this season. As the most capable
member of the line last season, Schil-
ling gained the trust of his coaches,
who have spoken glowingly of him
since. If Molk can complement him,
Schilling could end the year as an All-
Big Ten candidate.
Past them, the Wolverines boast
a wealth of young talent that should
play a huge part this year. Specifical-
ly, coach Rich Rodriguez had spoken
positively of Taylor Lewan, Quinton
Washington and Michael Schofield,
all of whom redshirted last season,
saying that all three will most likely
play roles on the line this year. After
shedding their high school physiques,
the three should provide an athletic
trio that will expectedly anchor a tal-
ented 0-line for the next three years
or so.
But of those three, Lewan seems
to be the name that's been buzzing
around the program during the spring
and summer. An absolutely monster
physically at 6-foot-8 and 283 pounds,
Lewan has spurred several, albeit pre-
emptive, comparisons to Wolverine
great Jake Long.
It's hard to ignore his size and ath-
leticism, but people are quick to forget
that Lewan played only one season in
high school on the offensive line and
didn't see any game time last season
due to redshirting. Regardless of his
inexperience, Lewan's physical tools

aren't something you see everyday.
The other tackle spot will most like-
ly be filled by above-average redshirt
junior Mark Huyge. He proved to be
serviceable and sometimes more than
that as he started nine of the Wol-
verines' 12 games last season. Fight-
ing for time will also be senior Perry
Dorrestein, but as a full-time starter
last season, Dorrestein was medio-
cre, showing for the first time in many
years that the Wolverines were hurt-
ing at the offensive tackle spot.
Sophomore Patrick Omameh
should fill out the rest of the line at the
other guard spot, impressing coaches
enough last season to earn significant
playing time at the tail end of the sea-
son.
Omameh is a quick and physical
force on the line, and coupled with
two stalwarts in Schilling and Molk,
the trio should make running up the

middle relatively easier than in Michi-
gan's past two seasons.
For Rodriguez, a wealth of talent
on the offensive front can only mean
good things, especially with a rela-
tively inexperienced offensive corps.
It won't be the best group up front that
the Wolverines have had in our life-
times, but considering the incredible
talent out of the offensive front as of
late, that's not really an insult.
If the Wolverines stay bowl eligible
or better, a lot of the credit will be due
to this corps up front who, like Molk
last season, will have a significant
effect on this season's direction.

BREST, Belarus - As Ashley Kroll

Jung comes into his own as team captain

By MATT KRASNOFF
Daily Sports Writer
When you can barely claim to be
six-feet tall and 150 pounds soaking
wet, you might look the same as any
other student doing work in the Fish
Bowl.
And yet, you just might be the cap-
tain of the Michigan men's tennis
team - senior Jason Jung.
Twice a member of the Academic
All-Big Ten, Jung spends plenty of
time concentrating on his academics
in the heart of Angell Hall. But it's his
ability to truly embody what it means
to be a student-athlete that separates
Jung from his peers.
Jung - a native of West Torrance,
California - has helped turn the Wol-
verines from an afterthought in the
Big Ten to one of the conference's top
teams in his first three seasons. Now,
as the squad's captain and unques-
tioned leader, he'll look to take Michi-
gan to the next level.
THE BEGINNING
Jung was born to Shane and Shu
Jung, both of whom came to America
from Taiwan. Shane came over for
college, and immediately became a
tennis enthusiast.
In aphone interviewwith the Daily,
Shane Jung, Jason's father, was able
> recall a four-year old Jung hitting
a tennis ball with a racket against a
wall. Shane continued on how Jung
played in tournaments for kids eight
and under when he was only six.
"My dad really got me into tennis,"
Jason said. "He was always my coach
growingup."
But Jung didn't really immerse
himself in the sport until he was
almost a teenager.
"Tennis kind of took off for me

when I was 12, which is when I started
traveling to play a lot more," Jung said.
From then on, the sport became an
everyday thing for Jung. And as tennis
became a more integral part of Jung's
life, so did sportsmanship. Shane and
Shu, Jason's mother, made a concerted
effort to make sure that their son pre-
sented himself in the proper manner
both on and off the courts. Sometimes
that was second nature to Jung, who
never really had much to say.
"Growing up, he was really quiet
and always wanted to help people, but
he also always wanted to have fun,"
Shane said.
Shu added, "He loves tennis and
really wants to do well, but since he
was little, he's been kind of quiet."
Leaving his family behind and
coming to Michigan wasn't the easi-
est move for Jung and his family. His
father said the adjustment was dif-
ficult at first, mainly because of how
much he loves seeing his son play.
But Jason never forgothis roots and
makes a point to talk to Shane on the
phone after every match - even with
the three-hour time difference.
"My dad developed my game, and
he still plays a big part in my life,"
Jung said.
CALIFORNIA DREAMIN'
As a high school tennis star, where
you can stay close to home and play in
the Pac-10, one of the nation's top ten-
nis conferences, many questioned why
jung would leave the West coast.
But Jung - whose older brother
attended UC-San Diego - knew
Michigan was the right fit for him.
Jung's parents lived in Michigan
when they first came to America,
making it an attractive destination if
he were to leave the state. And even
though he felt no pressure to stay in

the court, Jung would have to learn
how to balance being both an ath-
lete and a student. After struggling
at the beginning of his first semester,
a determined Jung turned to older
teammates for advice - Mike Sroc-
zynski, in particular, became Jung's
main mentor.
A year older than Jung, Sroczynski
was happy to take his new teammate
under his wing. The two would take
their friendship to the tennis courts,
becoming doubles partners for Jung's
first two seasons.
"When we were paired together for
doubles, I was really excited to play
with him because I knew he was a
very talented player," Sroczynski said.
Jung also found comfort in fellow
freshman Chris Madden. The two
knew each other from growing up in
California and were paired as room-
mates their first year in Ann Arbor.
Madden reminisced about going
through "freshmen stuff" with Jung.

good to turn down.
"A lot of the reason he ended up
at Michigan is the coach," Shu said.
"He really liked (Berque)."
Jung added that the University's

athletic prowess was an irresistible
combination.

From Page 11
Their friendship ship grew off the
court, but Jung faced challenges and
expectations on the court.
"(Jung) has always had the tal-
ent," Madden said. "Freshman year,
the team was playing well but he was
'4 playing in one of the top spots, which
is obviously a tough spot to come
right in to."
He added, "It's tough to come in
and play right away for any fresh-
man, let alone with the expectations
he had."
Jung was aware of what was
expected, but still got off to a hot
start in by winning the Big Ten Sin-
gles Championship as a freshman.
He hoped that his determination and
love for the game would help elimi-
nate any chasm that existed between
expectations and results.
"I've always wanted to do great,
and when I came in it was kind of
expected that I should be able to win
at the top most of the time," Jung said.
But after the victory, Jung went
through a rough patch - one that
Berque hoped he would use as a
learningtool.
"Playing number one or two in the
lineup as a freshman is tough, and he
went through some bumps that might
have affected his confidence," Berque
said.
Jung finished his first season with
a 22-12 double record, listed as No.

43 nationally with Sroczynski. But
singles was a different story.
After his singles championship in
the fall, Jung finished with a record
of 18-18.
That level of play was not some-
thing Jung was used to, and he vowed
to improve his play with each season.
"Having a year under my belt real-
ly helped me going into sophomore
year," Jung said, "Just the experience
and knowing what to do."
TENNIS ETIQUETTE
It's easy for athletes to get caught
up in the moment and demonstrate a
certain level of frustration or anger.
But in tennis, players are expected to
present themselves with the utmost
courtesy and respect for the game
and their opponent.
Jason Jung has done exactly that.
And opponents are taking notice.
"I think the thing that separates
(Jung) from most of the great play-
ers fighting for All-American honors
is that he competes with class," Ohio
State coach Ty Tucker said in an
e-mail interview with The Michigan
Daily. "There are never any crazy out-
bursts, flagrant bad calls, or general
bad attitude when he plays the game
of tennis."
This past season, Jung was award-
ed the ITA/Arthur Ashe Award for
Leadership and Sportsmanship. He
is the first member of the program
to ever receive such accolades on a
national level.
At the end of last year as well, Jung

received All-Big Ten honors for his
play on the court. Jung was also cho-
sen out of all the men's varsity teams
at Michigan to represent the school as
the Big Ten Conference Outstanding
Sportsmanship Award winner, a dis-
tinction given to just one male athlete
in each Big Ten school.
"His sportsmanship has always
been great," Berque said. "It's a nice
reflection of our team, that we value
those things, but he was who he was
long before he came here."
Associate coach Sean Maymi
worked with Jung on a more personal
level. The two went on trips togeth-
er for individual tournaments, and
Maymi has been able to watch Jung
gofromfreshmanstud toteamleader.
"(Jung's) attitude on the court
has always been very respectful and
very good," Maymi said. "He's always
respectful and polite, but this year, it
seemed like he was more focused and
driven."
And with all the awards and hon-
ors he's received, combined with his
academic prowess and continued
success on the court, naming him a
captain for the 2010-2011 season was
a pretty easy decision for Berque and
Maymi.
On June 1, Jung was named the
captain of Michigan's tennis team for
the upcoming season. With only one
other senior on the roster, there was
no debating who would be the team's
main leader in the fall.
Even the fellow senior couldn't
deny his friend's credentials.
"(Jung) was the clear choice to
be captain," Madden said. "He's the
type of person that you want to be
the head of your program."

actually kind of hard, but it was awe-
some."
Kroll added, "You look at them
like they're enemies, until you get
in a boat with them. When you come
together ... we're just a big, huge
team."
The process is more familiar to
Kroll, an LSA senior who plans to
graduate at the end of the fall semes-
ter.
Unlike Mueller, who raced for the
first time with the National Team in
Belarus, Kroll competed with the
team last year and won the silver
medal.
For the pair, being surrounded by
elite athletes all vying for a limited
number of team positions is a hum-
bling experience.
Referring to the new rowers on
the team, Kroll said that "especially
this year, the speed that they brought
in, it's insane."
Because Kroll and Mueller rowed
together at Michigan, they've had
the advantage of being comfortable

with each other from the begin-
ning of training for the U-23 World
Championships in Belarus.
"We're lucky because we're in the
same school, have. the same coach,
know the same rowing technique,"
Kroll said.
Being a part of a fairly successfu
athletic community has not made
the women jaded, though. Kroll said
that the opportunity to "race out of
the states ... is amazing.
"If you think you're good, or act
like you're the best, it doesn't do you
any good," Kroll said. "You just hav4
to be humble about it and pull really
hard, put your head down and pull as
hard as you can."
After winning the World Champi-
onships, both Kroll and Mueller plan
to continue rowing.
Kroll will be training with the
U.S. National Team in the fall as
Mueller will continue rowing and
attending classes at Michigan when
class starts in September.
While she is proud to race for the
National Team, Mueller represents
her school with equal fervor.
"I love Michigan so much," she
said. "I always love racing for them."
