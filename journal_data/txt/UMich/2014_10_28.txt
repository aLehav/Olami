Judge to determine
feasibility of
adjustment plan
by Nov. 7
By WILL GREENBERG
and NEALA BERKOWSKI
Daily News Editor
and Daily StaffReporter
More than a year after the city
of Detroit became the largest
municipality to declare Chapter
9 bankruptcy in U.S. history, the
decision regarding the city's pro-
posed plan of adjustment and the
beginnings of a new financial life
is now a reality.
In the closing arguments of
Detroit's bankruptcy trial, the
city's legal representation held
the floor most of the day, asking
to confirm the plan of adjust-
ment by reiterating the status of
deals with creditors, the fate of
the Detroit Institute of Art's art-
works and the pensions of city
workers. The next step will be
for U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Ste-
ven Rhodes to decide whether
Detroit's plan of adjustment is

feasible. This decision will come
on Friday, Nov. 7 at 2 p.m.
Bruce Bennett, the attorney
from law firm Jones Day who is
representing the city, reminded
those present to not lose sight of
how much has been accomplished
in the 15 months and 8 days since
Detroit filed for bankruptcy last
July - a quick proceeding com-
pared to other municipality bank-
ruptcy cases. The city has come
up with a broadly consensual
plan - which includes agreement
from all parties - that would dis-
charge $7 billion in claims and
reinvest $1.7 billion in the city,
Bennett lauded the city's over-
all efficiency in compiling a plan,
calling it "remarkable" that a
thorough plan was created in a
timeframe that was "not widely
expected when the case began."
He added that the timing also
helps to mitigate the negative
effects that an ongoing bankrupt-
cy has on a city.
"It is for your honor to take the
next big step and confirm this
plan," Bennett said to Rhodes,
adding that he'd like to see a
ruling from the judge before
Thanksgiving.

Existing protocol
may conflict with
ADA standards
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily News Editor
The Senate Advisory Commit-
tee on University Affairs con-
vened for its weekly meeting in
the Regent's Room of the Flem-

ing Administration Building
Monday afternoon to discuss the
Fitness for Duty policy.
Muchofthe group's discussion
centered on language regard-
ing revision of the policy and its
accompanying professional stan-
dards as they relate to University
faculty and staff. The Fitness for
Duty policy offers protections
to University employees in the
event that they find themselves
physically or mentally unable

to perform their jobs, including
possible financial compensation
during their investigation and
one year of severance pay if they
are let go due to their condition.
SACUA Chair Scott Masten,
a professor of business econom-
ics and public policy, said the
group was making progress and
had recently heard from the
Office of the Provost about the
"source of conflict" regarding
the Americans with Disabilities

Act and the University's current
standards of fitness for duty and
medical conditions.
Currently, the ADA places
emphasis on "job performance,"
and not the reason the individual
is unable to perform their job,
unless they choose to disclose
their disability. The law spe-
cifically forbids officials from
making assumptions about the.

Healthy Michigan
Plan garners more
participants than
predicted
By AMABEL KAROUB
Daily StaffReporter
Open Enrollment for 2015
health insurance plans is fast
approaching, and hundreds
of thousands of Michiganders
have recently signed up to
receive state aid to pay for their
healthcare plans.
The Healthy Michigan Plan
- Michigan's Medicaid expan-
sion -was approved in late 2013
and began accepting applica-
tions April 1. Six months in, the
number of enrollees in the plan
has already far exceeded pro-
jections for the firstyear.
Michigan is one of the most
recent states to expand the
Medicaid program. The plan
provides health care to Michi-
gan residents ages 19 to 64 with
incomes below133 percent of the
federal poverty line. For an indi-
vidual without a family to sup-
port, this would be an income of
$16,000 or less per year.

Candidate hopes
to foster more
collaboration with
Flint, Dearborn
By ALLANA AKHTAR
Daily StaffReporter
Attorney Mike Behm, one
of the Democratic candidates
for the University's Board of
Regents, is running on a plat-
form of decreasing tuition to
make the University more acces-
sible and working to increase
collaboration with the Univer-
sity's satellite campuses in Flint
and Dearborn.
In November, Behm will com-
pete for one of two spots on the
eight-member Board of Regents.
One of the open slots will be
vacated by University Regent
Julia Darlow (D-Ann Arbor),

who has opted to notseek anoth-
er term. The other is currently
held by Regent Kathy White
(D-Ann Arbor), who is up for
re-election. Two Republicans,
Dr. Rob Steele and Ron Weiser,
a former U.S. ambassador to Slo-
vakia, are also seeking election.
Regents are popularly elected by
voters from across the state of
Michigan.
A Flint native, Behm moved to
Ann Arbor in 1985 to study Eng-
lish at the University. Active on
campus, he wrote for The Michi-
gan Daily and sang in the Michi-
gan Men's Glee Club, the second
oldest club in the country, and
eventually sang a capella with
the renowned group The Friars.
After graduation, he attended
law school at Wayne State Uni-
versity in Detroit and currently
works as a litigator in Flint.
Recognized by the Ameri-
can Trial Lawyers Association
as one of the top 100 lawyers

in Michigan, Behm also served
as president of the trade asso-
ciation Michigan Association for
Justice in 2011.
"The mission of that group
is to protect peoples' Seventh
Amendment rights, to be able
to have a jury in front of their
peers," Behm said. "I think that's
something that's very impor-
tant."
Before deciding to run for
regent, Behm was an active
member of the Democratic Party
for much of his adult life. In 1996
he worked as a volunteer lawyer
for the Clinton campaign, and
in 2004 he created programs to
educate citizens about elections
to discourage voter intimidation
and urge people to vote. He also
served as a delegate to the Dem-
ocratic National Convention in
2008.
Behm said he decided to run
for regent on a platform of mak-

hygiene before flu season students waiting for answers

Efficacy of current
flu vaccine so
far uncertain
By ANASTASSIOS
ADAMOPOLOUS
Daily Staff Reporter
Fall is here. And while the
change of season signals the
arrival of colorful leaves and
pumpkin carving, it also signi-
fies the beginning of something
many prefer to avoid: flu season.
Dr. Robert Winfield, the
University's Chief Health Offi-
cer and Director of University
Health Service, said while the
University is planning to pro-
mote vaccination a bit more than
usual, the fact that there has not
yet been an outbreak of cases
actually poses challenges for
potential prevention measures.
"The influenza season has not
yet begun," Winfield said. "So
we do not know the strain of flu
U-M

we will be seeing this fall, and
we don't know if there is a good
match with the vaccine with the
circulating virus because there is
no circulating virus yet."
According to the Michigan
Department of Community
Health, a total of three people
have been hospitalized due to
influenza so far this flu season.
Winfield said the University is
currently focused on preparing
for the unlikely scenario that an
Ebola patient is diagnosed at the
University or arrives for treat-
ment at the University Hospital.
The University Health System
has already initiated practice
drills, purchased new equipment
and redesigned telephone proto-
cols to better indicate whether
the patient has been in contact
with someone with Ebola or has
been in countries such as Libe-
ria, Sierra Leone and New Guin-
ea in the last 21 days.
"Part of the conversation is
how to protect the community,
and how to make sure the health
H-i

care workers don't get contami-
nated and that other patients in
the hospital don't get contami-
nated" Winfield said.
Peter Logan, director of com-
munications for University
Housing, said he has no knowl-
edge of new measures for flu
prevention, and added that Uni-
versity Health Service would
direct Housing to adopt any
new measures they recommend.
In recent years, Logan said the
University has worked to inform
students about how to protect
themselves from influenza and
what to do if they get it.
While the most common
strain during flu season, influ-
enza A, can be treated with the
medicine Tamiflu, Winfield said
the most effective preventative
strategy is for people to keep
their hands clean.
Logan said Housing has sev-
eral initiatives in place for stu-
dents who do become ill. Feel
Better Meals allows a friend or
Residential Adviser to pick up
and deliver specially prepared
meals for sick students.
In 2010, the University was
the first college in the country
to introduce liquid ozone as a
cleaner in South Quad Residence
Hall, and the substance has since
been used in most residence
halls as well as in the Michigan
Union and Michigan League.
Ozone cleaners are stronger
and begin working more quickly
than other types of sanitizers.
"Obviously one of the key
messages we encourage our resi-
dents to follow is that if they do
get sick, we really advise them to
stay in bed, ride it out, get well,"
Logan said. "Don't take your ill-
ness, don't take your germs into
the community and into the
classrooms."

Three students
dead after series of
attacks by police
TIXTLA, Mexico (AP) -
Night is the most difficult time at
the rural teachers college, where
families have stayed on thin,
bare mattresses in classrooms
since 43 students went missing a
month ago. The day's distractions
of meals, meetings and marches
end, and the parents are left with
their thoughts, questions and a
simmering rage.
Sleep has eluded Clemente
Rodriguez Moreno, 46, since his
19-year-old son Christian dis-
appeared with his classmates.
Each night Rodriguez returns to
his home close to the Raul Isidro
Burgos school in Tixtla and his
mind races.
"What will come of them? We
don't know if he's eating, if he's
injured, if they're hitting him."
The families' lives have been
upended since police in the town
of Iguala, allegedly on the may-
or's orders, attacked the students
to stop them from interrupting
a speech by the mayor's wife on
Sept. 26. Both the mayor and his
wife are fugitives, along with the
police chief.
Three students, including one
later found with the skin peeled
off his face, and three people
unrelated to the attack, died in a
series of initial attacks.
Investigators say the rest of
the students were driven off to a
police station, later turned over
to the drug gang Guerreros Uni-
dos and have not been heard from
since.
Everything since has been a
nightmare, said a 57-year-old
farmer from Ayutla who spoke.
on condition of anonymity as a
precaution against reprisals. He
walks his 19-year-old son's cam-
pus in the Ayotzinapa neighbor-
hood in a daze.
"I don'tsleep for thethinking,"
he said, fingering a foil packet of
sleeping pills prescribed by a
doctor who came by to help. "I

don't feel like I'm living life."
His family has few resources,
he said, and his son came to the
school because the students sup-
port themselves. That's what he
said they were doing that after-
noon in Iguala, soliciting dona-
tions.
Staring at the photograph of
his son after a march to demand
the return of the missing, the
farmer spoke one moment of
the anguish of not knowing. His
eyes welled with tears and he
bit his lower lip. Next flashed an
anger that has been building over
weeks. He said he's tired of a cor-
rupt government that has always
scorned poor farmers. He wants
the guilty to pay.
"If they don't give them to us,
we'll have to proceed another
way, with more resistance," he
said.
There was so much confusion
in those early days, said Valen-
tin Cornelio Gonzalez, a 30-year
old farmer from the municipal-
ity of Tecoanapa who dropped
everything to travel to the
school, where his brother-in-law,
19-year-old Abel Garcia Hernan-
dez, is enrolled. Was the attack
at the school or in Iguala? Were
the attackers police or cartel gun-
men? How many students were
missing?
Some gaps have since been
filled, but the gaping one, the
one families care most about,
remains a void, despite the arrest
and interrogation of 56 suspects
so far.
As of last week, authorities had
located 38 sets of remains and 11
mass graves in Iguala without
linking any to the students. On
Monday, investigators were dig-
ging again in nearby Cocula and
found more remains after the
confessions of four new detain-
ees.
As of Monday afternoon, the
families had not been informed
about the discovery, which only
adds to the growing frustration.
"A lot of time has passed and
still there's nothing," Gonzalez
said.
So, clad in well-worn leather

sandals, he has been marching -
in the state capital of Chilpancin-
go, in Acapulco, in Mexico City
- demanding an answer. When
he first arrived at the school he
and other relatives spent a fruit-
less day searching around Igua'-
la. They feared for their safety,
but fault the government for not
doing enough: "They're not look
ing forthem like they should."
Mario Cesar Gonzalez, 49, the
father of 21-year-old Cesar Man-
uel Gonzalez Hernandez, spends
his days at the school pacing in
cowboy boots. He's boiling too
much inside to sit for a massage
or take lessons in meditation
techniques offered by others
who want to help. He can't stand
with the other parents before
the makeshift altar in the middle
of the school's basketball court to,
sing a hymn. One minute he's lis-
tening in a small circle of parents
on the basketball court and the
next he's walking away, his ceOl
phone held tight to one ear and a
cigarette between his fingers.
He's so proud of his son. Even
after weeks without news of
their whereabouts, Gonzalez and
other parents unfailingly speak
of their children in the present
tense. Cesar wantsto fight forthe
poor, he said.
Cesar told his mother he
would help her so she could leave
the department store job that
exhausts her.
The young man doesn't know
that after a month of living at his
school and waiting for his return,
his mother has lost her job. So has
his father, who worked at a body
shop in Huamantla.
"That doesn't matter to me
anymore," Gonzalez said.
Clemente Rodriguez left his
chickens, geese and pigs, as well*
his work delivering water jugs,
to spend four days last week in
Mexico City collecting donations
for the school, marching and tell-
ing his story over and over
Sporting cowboy boots and an
Angry Birds baseball cap, Rodri-O
guez boasted that his son stands
over six feet tall and loves to folk
dance.

New program aims
to increase hiring
of disabled workers
Gov. Rick Snyder is directing
state agencies to make it a goal
to hire people with disabilities
and mental illnesses.
The governor issued a direc-
tive Monday that all executive
agencies participate in a new
program designed to attract
and retain disabled employees.
Snyder's move stems from rec-
ommendations made by a men-
tal health commission that he
created last year.
Lt. Gov. Brian Calley, who
chairs the commission, told
reporters on a conference call
that the state of Michigan must
"lead by example" so other
employers follow. The goal is
boosting overall integrated
employment of disabled employ-
ees while keeping their personal
information confidential.

A 50-year-old woman is
charged with first-degree mur-
der in the beating death of a
66-year-old woman in a subur-
ban Detroit apartment build-
ing.
The Wayne County pros-
ecutor's office said Monday that
Tewana Sullivan of Detroit will
be arraigned Nov. 6.
Livonia police arrested Sul-
livan on Wednesday night after
officers found the severely beat-
en victim unconscious in the
building, west of Detroit. Sulli-
van was visiting a relative in the
building.
She was charged last week
with attempted murder, and the
prosecutor upgraded the charge
after the victim died Saturday.
NASHVILLE
Pastor performs
* gay marriage,
keeps ordination
A Methodist pastor who was
disciplined after he officiated at
the wedding of his gay son will
be allowed to remain an ordained
minister.
The Judicial Council of the
nation's second-largest Protestant
denomination ruled Monday that
a Pennsylvania church jury was
wrong to defrock Frank Schaefer
last year after he would not prom-
ise never to perform another same-
sex wedding.
The council ruled on technical
grounds and did not express sup-
port for gay marriage in general.
Its decision is final.
Reached by phone after the deci-
sion, Schaefer called it "amazing."
He said he was pleased, "not
just for myself, but for everyone in
the LGBTQ community and the

church. This is a positive decision
that keeps the dialogue going.
They didn't bar a person who is an
outspoken activist and who has
said that, if asked, he would per-
form another gay marriage."

DETROIT
From Page 1
Bennett gave thorough expla-
nations of each of the more con-
tentious topics within the plan of
adjustment.
He spent a good portion of
his time Monday discussing
the feasibility of the plan, high-
lighting the two major quali-
fications: that the city meets
its financial obligations and
be able to recover and provide
adequate city services. Bennett
walked through the previous
evidence presented to the court
again, noting the assessments
made by Mayor Mike Duggan
and the city offices that deter-
mined that the city is prepared
to provide services.
Rhodes questioned Bennett
about possible risks that could
threaten the feasibility of the
plan, including unknown vari-
ables such as as a new mayor
and his administration. Bennett
noted such variables are diffi-
cult to predict. He said the worst
thing that could happen "is if the
$1.7 billion is misused or per-
ceived to be misused."
Bennett reviewed the viabil-
ity of increasing property taxes
on Detroiters to help repay
creditors. He used a "depart-
ment store analogy" to explain
why the city believes raising
taxes would hurt Detroit. He
said when people decide where
to live, they will compare the
taxes and services of cities. Ben-
nett argued that higher taxes
could give individuals incentive
to leave Detroit, which would
further decrease the city's tax
base and, in turn, level of servic-
es. Bennett said the more central
question is whether or not taxes
should be reduced.
Rhodes also specifically ques-
tioned Bennett about the topic of
long-term pension recovery. The
two discussed the projections
for the plan, noting the possi-
bility that pensions could fully
recover eventually but acknowl-
edging the complicated math
and many variables that can
affect the plan's outcome.
While Rhodes already made
the decision that the Michigan
Constitution's stated protec-
tion for pensions does not carry
more weight than any other con-
tract agreement within the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, he returned

to the topic Monday in his line
of questions for of Bennett. One
individual objector pressed the
issue, addressing some of the
minor. details of the Michigan
Constitution's requirements for
each retiree.
In his explanation of the DIA
settlement, Bennett addressed
three major questions: whether
the city is able to sell the DIA's
assets, whether liquidated assets
can be used to pay creditors and
whether the city should be com-
pelled to sell assets at all.
Bennett said due to restric-
tions on the DIA's art as part of
a charitable trust, among other
restrictions, itcannotbesold. He
added that there is no legal obli-
gation for the city to liquidate all
its assets to pay off obligations.
He also said the DIA serves as
a "nationally prominent cul-
tural institution," maintaining
it could also potentially draw
people back to the city. Bennett
argued the $466 million pledged
through the grand bargain is the
best possible outcome for the
DIA.
Under the grand bargain, the
DIA would no longer be owned
by the city. Funding from the
DIA, the state as well as non-
profit and for-profit organiza-
tions would prevent the sale of
DIA artwork and reduce cuts
to pensions. Though creditors
argued failure to sell the art
unfairly discriminated against
them as compared to pensioners
- initially believing more money
could have been generated by
selling the art - major creditors
have since signed on to deals in
which they are compensated in
otherways.
Bennett expressed confidence
in Rhodes' expected decision
regarding the DIA, saying he
intends to return to Detroit after
the bankruptcy as a tourist.
"I'm not in a rush; I under-
stand the DIA will be here for a
while," he said.
Other speakers Monday were
Steve Howell, special assistant
attorney general for the state of
Michigan, representatives from
various city pension organiza-
tions and three dissenters.
Howell said the plan of adjust-
ment is in the best interest of
creditors. He said it is a chance
for the city to move forward
and grow, and called for this
"unprecedented opportunity" to
be approved by Rhodes.

INSURANCE

income individuals. Medicaid is
funded by both the states and the
federal government, and is admin-
istered by each state. States were
not required to adopt a Medicaid
program, but every state currently
has a program in place.
The ACA increased federal
funding for Medicaid, but also
required that states would pay
10 percent of the expansion by
2020. Then, in 2012, the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled that states
could continue to receive their
original funding for Medicaid
without expanding the program.
As of now, a little over half of the
states -27 states and the District
of Columbia - have chosen to
expand Medicaid.
Researchers from the Uni-
versity Medical School analyzed
data from the first 100 days of the
Healthy Michigan Plan, during
which there were surprisingly
high levels of enrollment.
Prof. John Ayanian, director of
the Institute for HealthcaretInno-
vation and Policy, coauthored a
paper in the New England Jour-
nal of Medicine that analyzed
early data from the expansion.
In its first few months, the plan
enrolled over 327,000 people,
more than were predicted to
enroll in the entire year. By Oct.
20, 2014, the number of enrollees
had reached 424,852.
Ayanian suggested some rea-
sons for the plan's early success.
One reason is the late rollout of
the plan. Most state Medicaid
expansions began Jan. 1, 2014.
Michigan's did not begin until
April 1, 2014. Ayanian said these
extra three months allowed
state officials to communicate to
people that they were eligible for
assistance. The extra months also
gave the state more time to pre-
pare the plan's enrollment web-
site, ensuring its efficiency. An
efficient website was especially
necessary due to the initial prob-

lems with HealthCare.gov - the
ACA's online insurance market-
place - that were widely publi-
cized in the media.
"The key state officials made
it a priority to test the computer
systems that were required to
enroll people to make sure they
were working effectively before
enrollmentbegan," Ayanian said.
Ayanian said Michigan's suc-
cess could also serve as an exam-
ple to largely Republican states.
Historically, Republicans have
opposed the expansion of Med-
icaid. While Michigan generally
votes Democratic in the presiden-
tial election and is represented in
theU.S.SenatebytwoDemocrats,
the state has a Republican gover-
nor and Republicans control both
houses of the legislature.
"It'sagoodmodelparticularlyfor
other states that have Republican
governors or legislatures and have
reservations about expanding the
Medicaidprogram,"Ayaniansaid.
Open Enrollment for 2015
insurance coverage under the
ACA will begin again Nov. 15.
This year, the Healthy Michi-
gan Plan will also be in place
throughout the Open Enroll-
ment period. Carrie Rheingans,
project manager for the Washt-
enaw County Health Initiative,
said HealthCare.gov will inform
Michigan residents who qualify
for benefits under the Healthy
Michigan Plan. These individuals
can then go to the plan's website
to register for saidbenefits.
"HealthCare.gov points you
in the direction you need to go,"
Rheingans said.
Lastyear, Michigan had notyet
expanded Medicaid when Open
Enrollment ended. For this rea-
son, Rheingans said low-income
individuals could not sign up for
the expanded benefits until after
having registered for their insur-
ance plan.
People already enrolled in
the Healthy Michigan Plan will
also see a change in the coming
months. Previously, no one regis-
tered under the plan would have

to pay any fees, excepting copays,
which would usually be only $1 or
$2 per month. Now, if an individ-
ual falls betweenl100and138 per-
cent of the federal poverty level,
he or she will have a monthly fee
in addition to copays. This fee
begins sixmonthsafter one starts
receiving services through Med-
icaid, and the amount is based
on how much healthcare one has
received over the past six months.
"Those folks will also be asked
to make what they're calling
'monthly contributions' to their
health insurance," Rheingans
said. "They've looked at the cost
of all of it and what quantity of
services you're using, and they
make an average over those six
months to say that's about how
much you should be paying every
month going forward for the next
since months."
Rheingans said though the fee
should be low for most people,
it still may cause difficulties for
the people it affects, especially
because many in this income
range do not have bank accounts
through which they can easily
pay the fees.
"It's hard to know what is
'expensive,' because folks who
are between 100 and 138 percent
of the poverty line, it's not like
they're rich people," she said.
"It's still yet another payment,
and people have to have a bank
accounttomakethesepayments."
The open enrollment period
for this year extends from Nov.15
to Feb. 15, 2015. During this time,
individuals can sign up for a new
health insurance plan or look at
options for switching from their
current plan. 2014 Marketplace
plans will expire Dec.31.
Students can get information
about healthcare optionsthrough
campus resources, such as Uni-
versity Health Service, or com-
munity resources, such as the
Washtenaw County Health Ini-
tiative. Information is also avail-
able online at HealthCare.gov

COUNCIL
From Page 1
tive of that. I supported our pre-
sumptive mayor. Does that mean
that I don't have my own mind?
Absolutely not."
There are two other new
members who will take their
seats on the Council in 2015:
Westphal, who ran against
Nancy Kaplan, a member of
the Ann Arbor District Library
Board, for the seat vacated by
Petersen; and Graydon Krapohl,
who ran uncontested for the
open fourth ward seat follow-
ing the retirement of Margie
Teall (D-Ward 4).
"I have become acquainted
with the incoming new council-
members," Westphal said. "I've
had some interactions with
Christopher in the past in his
duties as a councilmember in
the past, and I am hoping it will
be the case that everyone con-
tinues to be civil on Council and
works for the best of the com-
munity."
Following the mayoral pri-
mary, which included four cur-
rent councilmembers, some
see the possibility for tension
between those members who
will continue to serve on Coun-
cil. If elected mayor in the gen-
eral election, Taylor, who won
the primary with 47.57 percent
of the vote, will serve alongside
former primary opponents Bri-
ere and Kunselman.
Kunselman, who received
16.46 percent of the vote, said
following the primary that he
looks forward to working with
Taylor and fellow councilmem-
bers in the future. Kunsel-
man and Taylor have served
together on Council since
2009, though in the 2008 elec-
tion, Kunselman lost his seat to
Taylor. Kunselman ran again in
2009 and has been on Council
since.
"There's no sense of dread,"
Kunselman said. "I'm keeping
a very open mind and I think
Council dynamics are going to
continue very much how they
have been, where there are

issues that are more important
to some members than others
that eventually results in com-
promise."
In a mayoral debate earlier
this year, Briere said she does
not consider herself aligned
with anyone in particular on
Council, including Hieftje.
"I don't belong to a faction,"
Briere said. "John is gone and
we should get over it. Now we
look at the future. As much as
we may like John or agree with
his policies, I'm not running
against John and I'm not run-
ning to beat John."
However, the question on
voters' minds may not have
been whether Briere was
running against Hieftje, but
rather whether she was going
to make decisions similar to
Hieftje's. Taylor has aligned
himself indirectly with the.
former mayor since the begin-
ning of his mayoral campaign,
and his near-majority victory
illustrated that a desire for
change was not driving voters'
decisions.
"I don't expect our govern-
ment to change much, I expect it
to fine-tune around the edges,"
Kunselman said. "The biggest
change is that when you no lon-
ger have the longest-serving
mayor presiding over, there's
going to be a learning curve for
everyone, even for Chris Taylor,
assuming he is the next mayor.
We are going to have to learn
how to identify others' posi-
tions within Council."
Though new to the Council,
Grand served with Taylor on
the Park Advisory Commission
and said she is not concerned
that there will be any linger-
ing tensions following election
season.
"I'm not really concerned
about the councilmembers
that ran for mayor; I don't
think that's what is driving the
dynamic," Grand said. "I'm hop-
ing with a new mayor and some
new councilmembers that we
can try to get rid of some of these
old divisions. I'm not naive about
that, but I certainly want to do
my best to compromise."

SACUA

ing to perform their job func-
tions unless they voluntarily
confirm their disability.
"We have to make it clear that
any fitness for duty policy will
only apply to faculty with men-
tal or physical illness that keeps
them from adequately perform-
ing their duties," Masten said.
"There's no way to meet both
the ADA requirements and cover
only physical and medical condi-
tions if (this interpretation of)
the ADA is right."
He added that working to cre-
ate a policy that suits the needs of
the University while complying
with ADA standards will contin-
ue to be a group effort, and that
the next step is getting a second
opinion from a "foremost expert"
in the Law School.
Masten then compared the
proposed language with that of
the University's existing fitness
for duty policy, which currently
applies to all University faculty
and staff. Fitness for duty is cur-
rently defined as "being physi-
cally and mentally capable of
safely performing the duties of
their job," and implies that any-
thing outside of those standards
constitutes "unfitness for duty."
"Either the current policy is

not compliant with the ADA,
which, who knows, maybe it was
just never updated, so if we don't
agree to implement the new fit-
ness for duty policy, we'd be bet-
ter off with (the ADA's version)
than the one we currently have,"
Masten said. "Part of the reason
for the new policy was it doesn't
encompass all the considerations
that would go into an appropriate
consideration for faculty, but at
least this one is limited to mental
and physical conditions."
Most SACUA members agreed
that there was a need for specific
language regarding mental and
physical conditions since those
are the main reasons for which
a fitness for duty investigation
would be opened initially.
Pharmacy Prof. David Smith
saidhe feltthe abilityto"safelyexe-
cute one's duties" should be the key
requirement for being classified
fit for duty, leaving out mention of
specific mental or physical health
requirements.According,to Smith,
such requirements might make the
language more in accordance with
ADA standards, but many other
members wanted to keep the lan-
guage in the revised policy.
Smith added that there are
other probable factors that could
potentially render faculty mem-
bers "unable to perform essential
functions" outside of mental and
physical complications, but it was

deemed that most other suggest-
ed behaviors would dictate "will-
ful refusal," which would amount
to insubordination, a cause for
termination that does not apply
to any fitness for duty policy.
"There are experts who can
provide examinations for medi-
cal issues, mental and physical,"
Masten said. "If it's a non-med-
ical issue, who's going to make
that determination?"
Currently, non-medical issues
are at the discretion of the dean
of the faculty member's college,
who would then open an inves-
tigation to determine whether
the individual is capable of con-
tinuing to work. The group con-
cluded that this process could be
seen as "arbitrary" and that they
wanted to work toward a more
concrete policy.
"We'd have a lot less concern
about this if we were having
medical professionals making
this call," Masten said. This led
to discussion about excluding
those without physical or mental
limitations from the protections
of the policy.
Next Monday, SACUA will
be joined by University Provost
Martha Pollack. The following
week, theywillhave theirmonth-
ly check-in with University
President Mark Schlissel at their
regularly scheduled meeting.

ing college more affordable and
accessible statewide.
In terms of affordability, he
said his first initiative would be to
decrease the recent trend of the
University's budget being cov-
ered more by tuition and endow-
ment and less by the state. He
said if the state bears more of the
costs, tuition could decrease.
"I would like to see the state
of Michigan reinvest in the Uni-
versity of Michigan and in public
education," he said.
Closely linked to the cost of
higher education, Behm said
affordability could be improved by
increasing access to need-based
loans. Currently, one-third of stu-
dents attendingthe state's 15 pub-
lic universities receive need-based
loans,yet, accordingto Behm, only
12 percent of University students
receive this type of aid.
"I do not think that is an accurate
reflection of the picture of what the
student body should be here," he
said. "That needsto be fixed."

To improve affordability,
Behm said the University could
tap into its endowment - which
reached an all-time high of $9.7
billion in the 2014 fiscal year - to
keep costslow and could also look
to federal legislation to lower the
borrowing rate for student loans.
As a Flint native who works in
the city, Behm said he also feels a
responsibility to advocate for the
University's satellite campuses in
Flint and Dearborn.
Though the two campuses have
typically been less residential
than Ann Arbor, Behm noted how
when a dorm was built forthe first
time at Flint in 2009, it immedi-
ately filled to capacity. He linked
this to a changing culture of satel-
lite campuses and their potential
togrow in the near future.
"Those campuses really offer
an opportunity for the Univer-
sity of Michigan to interact with
the students and communities of
Flint and Dearborn," he said.
With respect to diversity,
Behm said the University must
work toward increasing racial
diversity on campus, but within
the boundaries of Proposal 2, the

2006 voter initiative that banned
the consideration of race in
admissions, among other factors.
He said the percentage of Black
students thatmake up the student
body is far less than the number
of Black citizens in the state.
"This is a public University; it
serves the mission and the people
of our entire state, not just some
of the people," he said. "We need
to fix that problem."
Behm also expressed a will-
ingness to work with students
to make the activities and deci-
sions of University administra-
tors more transparent. In July,
The Detroit Free Press sued the
University for violating the open
Meetings Act, arguing that the
Board of Regents makes most of
its decisions in private.
Behm said he plans to meet
with students and faculty regu-
larly during his tenure on the
board, noting thatthe best way to
bring a perspective of the issues
facing students and faculty is to
interact with them directly.
"That's what makes an institu-
tion work, is open communica-
tion," he said.

A horror story from a lower-class traveler

never a mention of intersectionality.
Nobody attempts to contextualize
the discussion.
Muslims are often denied the right
to be present in the conversation.
We're rarely invited to the table, to the
panel, to the conference. An educated
discussion on Muslim women and
their rights is welcome. What is not
welcome is using the state of Muslim
womenasatooltopropagateneoliberal
ideology. What is not welcome is using
their name to mobilize an ideology
that advocates their inferiority. Who
is Maher championing exactly? Why
are they always talked about but
never present?
By leaving Muslims out of the
conversation you limit their ability to

claim their reality. To quote Edward
Said, you can control the East/Orient
by "making statements about it,
authorizing views of it, describing
it, by teaching it, settling it: in short,
Orientalism as a Western style for
dominating, restructuring, and having
authority over the Orient."
Maher practices neo-orientalism,
a reincarnation of orientalism that
pits Islam against the West. The
ideology is harmful. It compromises
the safety of Muslims in the West
and claims authority over Muslims
everywhere. It creates a hierarchy on
who getsto speak on the topic. Nobody
asked Maher or Harris or Affleck or
Kristof to present their credentials.
Their authority on the topic is never

questioned. Despite the fact that none
of them is actually affected by the
radical Islam they seem to discuss.
Maher never actually presents
any solutions. He operates with a
smugness that says, 'I am superior,
these people are terrible, let me
provide my unsolicited opinion
for ratings.'
Personally, I don't find anything
remotely funny or intelligent about
his show. Then again, maybe I'm just
one of those oppressed Arab, Muslim
women who doesn't understand the
work good liberals like Maher are
doing on my behalf.

Holidays are a great time ina student's
life - family, friends, food, food and
more food. They're also extremely
stressful. Students have
to debate how to split
their time between home-
work and visits to home,
between family members
- especially in divorced
households - and between
time and money wasted
when traveling to the ones
they love. DEVIN
Unfortunately, when EGGERT
it comes to traveling, I'm
pretty cheap.
My horror story begins with a bus company
that I swore to God I would never travel with
again - even at my own inconvenience: the
infamous Greyhound bus. Now, you don't sign
up for the Greyhound without knowing what
you're getting into. (You are Jack Dawson with
a ticket to the lowest floor of a ship that you
hope doesn't get lost in the ocean and delayed
for two days.) I arrived early to the packed
Chicago bus station and went to the bathroom
- I exited as soon as possible because there
were people bathing in the sinks and someone
was throwing up. I showed a worker my ticket.
A pack of people from Ann Arbor followed the
worker and me to the designated waiting area
for our ride.
Our ride was never announced, even after
several inquiries as to when the bus might be
coming. An hour after we were supposed to
board, a worker freaked out, realizing that the
station forgot to announce our bus arrival. A
parent of a University student got the manager,
who suddenly realized the mistake. Yet, instead
of helping the situation, the manager started
flipping out. When I say flipping out, I mean
that the manager said that all 20 of us from Ann
Arbor were liars and that she was going to get
the police. If we moved, security would kick us
out. We found this really strange and scary. We
wondered who she was yelling at, considering our
group was abnormally polite. It seemed like she
was yelling at an imaginary person. Greyhound
security surrounded us for an hour. Two other
girls from the University and I were crying. The
manager kept yelling incoherent directions. We
honestly didn't know what to do. Some adults
were asking why we were being surrounded.
The security said they had no idea and that the
manager just told them to do so. I was shaking. A
lot of people gave up and left the station.
The worker who originally led us to the area
walked by. I called out to him to see what had
happened. He said Greyhound messed up and
they were trying to cover themselves. But, he
refused to tell a higher manager because he
didn't want to lose his job. After two hours of
standing, the manager returned. She said we
stood in the wrong area and that all 20 of us
(now 11because nine people went home) missed
the announcement. It was all our fault. Out of
the goodness of her heart, the Greyhound
manager said we could possibly get on the next
bus ... if we could convince the bus'driver. She
also threw in that it probably wouldn't happen

because our group was undeserving and had
bad attitudes.
Intears,threeofusgirlsbeggedthebusdriver
of the next bus to let us in. This was a situation
in which none of us was from Chicago, school
was the next day, and we would somehow have
to rent a hotel and figure out how to get to Ann
Arbor if they didn't let us on. The bus driver
was furious. She refused to let 11 of us on the
bus even though there were 11 empty seats. One
of the older gentlemen threw a fit on the phone
to the company. The bus driver let us on after
receiving a command from her radio telling her
that she must let us on the bus.
The bus driver ran off the bus to yell at the
station owners. We all got on. I was the last, left
with four seat options - all of which had the
bus driver's stuff sprawled across them. Since
I was scared of the bus driver and pretty much
every worker of Greyhound, I stayed standing.
The people at the front of the bus sympathized
with how the bus driver was treating us, and
one woman moved her pillow that was block-
ing one of the seats so that I could sit down. I
did. And, I kid you not, when the bus driver
returned she accused me of stealing stuff out of
her purse, which was next to me. It was awful.
The only reason I was allowed to stay was that
the front of the bus vouched for me, and the
woman traded seats with me.
After riding the bus for an hour, the bus
driver said she didn't want to go to Ann Arbor,
so she was going to drop us off in Detroit (three
girls were going to get dropped off in the middle
of Detroit at night). I tried to message some
friends in the area. Meanwhile, a creepy guy
next to me kept saying things about blondes,
college girls and then started singing, "What
am I going to do with three hot college girls
alone at night" over and over. I tried to act like
I was sleeping. I opened my eyes. He was a foot
away staring at me and touching my arm.
The bus driver had a change of heart in
Detroit and decided to drive us to Ann Arbor
after an older man talked to her. For the first
time, I had tears of relief, even though she
dropped us off far from the Ann Arbor stop
because "it wasn't worth driving in." The
creepy guy got off with us even though he was
supposed to go to Flint. He started following us.
Thanks to my self-defense knowledge, I took a
pen (as a weapon). I turned around and told him
in an angrytone that I have a cab coming in the
next minute. And, he was not allowed to follow
me or get in. I kept walking with my thumb on
911. He called out some sexual stuff but whatev-
er, he turned around and walked the other way.
I did make it home to my residence hall safe-
ly. So did everyone from Ann Arbor. I ran into
one of the girls I met at the Greyhound station at
Charley's. We bonded over the terrifying expe-
rience. I guess through all this, my point of this
ghastly story is: 1. Don't ride a Greyhound, 2.
Time trumps money sometimes - even for the
cheap, and 3. Just because Jack Dawson paid for
a lower class ticket doesn't mean he shouldn't
be given humane treatment if the Titanic sinks.

The importance of not being a Cool Girl

.i. v

Afew days ago I finally gave in
and saw "Gone Girl."
After weeks of observing
my friends'
reactions of disgust
and amazement
and vows to never,
ever get married,
I decided to see if
I would still have
the same vaguely
nonchalant JULIA
reaction toward ZARINA
that particular
interpretation as
I did when I read
the book a few years ago. I did. To me,
the story has always been a cautionary
tale about modeling yourself around
an unrealistic ideal, of catering to
the expectations of others to a fault
and about the motivations that cause
someone to become a Cool Girl, taken
to theirlogical extreme.
A few often-cited paragraphs from
the book were still the most relevant
part of the story to me; the paragraphs
that instantly turned a piece of fiction
into a relatable, frighteningly caution-
ary tale where calculated, sociopathic
murder previously had not.
"Men always say that as the defining
compliment, don't they? She's a cool
girl. Being the Cool Girl means I-am a
hot, brilliantfunny woman who adores
football,poker, dirty jokes, and burping,
who plays video games, drinks cheap
beer, loves threesomes and anal sex,
and jams hot dogs and hamburgers
into her mouth like she's hosting the
world's biggest culinary gang bang
while somehow maintaining a size 2,
because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot
and understanding. Cool Girls never get
angry; they only smile in a chagrined,
loving manner and let their men do
whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on
me,I don't mind, I'm the Cool Girl.
"Men actually think this girl exists.
Maybe they're fooled because so many
women are willing to pretend to be this
girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended
me. I used to see men - friends, co-
workers, strangers - giddy over these
awful pretender women, and I'd want to
sit these men down and calmly say: You
are not datinga woman, you are dating
a woman who has watched too many
movies written by socially awkward
men who'd like to believe that this kind
of woman exists and might kiss them."
I've spent a long time thinking
about Cool Girl without ever calling
her by that name. Freshman year,
my friends and boyfriend at the time
discovered the "The League," an FX
show that chronicles the bro-ing out of
a group of middle-aged man-children
whose entire lives revolve around a
fantasy football league. The wife of
one of these men, the main recurring
female character in the cast, is a classic
Cool Girl, respected where other
women are not due to the fact that her
primary interests in the show appear
to be, in no particular order: bro-ing
out, eating meat while bro-ing out,
drinking beer while bro-ing out and
talking about football while looking
hot while bro-ing out. Among my
friends, a new standard for the ideal
woman was instantly set.
I actually enjoy this show for the
most part. I laugh at the jokes. It's

crude and immature in a way that I
don't even pretend to be above. The
anxiety that this show caused me at
the time was related to the fact that
suddenly, there was a very clear-cut
model of what I needed to be in order
to be respected, admired, wanted and
cool - and I couldn't have been more
opposite.I donotreallyenjoywatching
football for days. I take, serious issue
with misogynistic attitudes. When
people treat me poorly, they definitely
hear about it. I'm a vegetarian. I am,
at my essence, not a Cool Girl. I never
have been.
Suddenly, however, at 19 years
old, being a Cool Girl seemed very
important. Like almost everyone in
college around me, I was insecure and
trying to make a name for myself by
adopting an identity that set me apart
from what I perceived to be boring
and typical. I was a feminine girl and
identified as a feminist, whichmeant I
was like all the other girls. By denying
these qualities I was somehow
different and above the rest. I chugged
beer and approached relationships like
they were the world championships
of trying to out-sociopath the
other person. I always cared less. I
memorized football trivia. I was "less
of a girl than most boys." I laughed at
sexist jokes. I was cool.
Being in college and being in your
twenties is a life lived in extremes.
It's a phase that results from recently
being turned loose in a world that
expects you to become a fully formed,
fully functional, independent human
being. You and everyone around you
try on values and majors and styles
and defining personal characteristics
in the pursuit of something that fits.
You're pre-med one year and an
English major the next. Your social
views evolve rapidly. Faking it until
you make it takes on a whole new
meaning in job interviews, student
clubs and social circles. Your identity
in public is often a mirrored reflection
of the characteristics that you believe
to wholly define the certain kind of
person you would like to be.
Identityin college can often resem-
ble a prototype of a future existence.
Its like high fashion on a runway, an
extreme version of something that
gets distilled and diluted by design-
ers who know how to adapt a vision
to something appropriate for daily life
before it is widely applied to clothes
we see in the stores. Being in your
twenties and assumingan identitycan
be like going straight from the runway
to the streets - a phase where we try
to make life duplicate art, rather than
imitate aspects of it.
The issue with this, of course, is
that art is not a fully representative,
fully dimensional portrayal of the
world around us. Irealized thatI spent
a lot of time reflecting the values that
I wanted to be associated with, rather
than internalizing them, processing
them and then embodying them as
something integral to myself and my
own personality.
The full result of this realization
has been that I'm finally done. It's been
a longtime coming, but I'm done with
Cool Girl. Cool Girl is a trope. Cool Girl
in her full, silver-screen glory is an
affected personality put on out of inse-

curity and a need to be seen as some-
thing different than the rest. Cool Girl
measures her self-worth by the men
who say they love her because she's not
like other girls, even when she knows
they have shallow love for an equally
shallow faade.
Living as Cool Girl is a kind of
performance art, and like any other
artistic representation of a real thing,
there are elements left out of the public
presentation. Behind the scenes, when
the rest of the cast goes home and the
camera crew packs up for the night,
Cool Girl cries when she is treated like
shit. Cool Girl is not effortlessly a size
two - for each joke about shotgunning
a pizza, there are days spent skipping
dinner and despising the way she
looks. Cool Girl might not actually
think those sexist jokes are funny, but
she laughs because she dislikes the
idea of immediately being categorized
and discredited as "oversensitive" or
"an angry feminist" even more.
For both the men who think they
want her and the women who think
they want to be her, so much of the
appeal of the Cool Girl comes from
the thrill of chasing an ideal. In a
recent article, Tracy Moore of Jezebel
concludes that men "who have never
examined such tropes will willingly
join this thrilling chase ... because it is
so unlike the cultural narrative (they)
are taught to expect - that every
woman around is tryingto ensnareyou
longbeforeyouarereadytobesnared."
If having a clingy girlfriend spells
the end of bros everywhere, Cool Girl
laughs in the face of death. She is dis-
tant and hot and possesses an absurd
ability that can only come from some
deep denial of human nature to shut
down anything remotely resembling
an emotion.
Cool Girl lets you do whatever you
want and take everything and give
nothing and has no needs of her own
because she is not a real person. She is
never unreasonable. She is mysterious.
She is one-dimensional. Because she is
literally not a real person.
Eventually, this performance
gets tiring. Eventually, Cool Girl
would prefer to be treated as a living,
breathing, feeling human and not as
a rare and prized commodity. Being
a Cool Girl forever means denying
feminism as avaluable bond, viewing
relationships as a contest with a clear
winner and seeing emotions as an
inherent weakness. In short,it means
missing out on some of the best
elements of real life. In the immortal
words of Lester Bangs, "the only true
currency in this bankrupt world is
what you share with someone else
when you're uncool."
I'mdonewith CoolGirlbecause I'm
ready to grow up and become a real
person, with faults and complexities
and an identity that I develop, rather
than adapt. I'm ready to be around
people who think critically about
who they are. Rejecting an unrealistic
ideal - whatever that may be - is a
critical step in becoming the person
you will be for the rest of your life. I'm
realizing in the process that, for all my
"un-coolness," I really like who thatis.

Dangerous discourse

Afew weeks ago, a video of Ben Affleck
and Bill Maher debating radical Islam
went viral. After watching it the first
time, I knew that I had
to write about it. Not
because I thought it was
particularly interesting,
but because I'm still unable,
to comprehend how it even
happened in the first place. =
So let's set the scene:
The video is a clip
of Maher's show, "Real HAYA
Time with Bill Maher." It ALFARHAN
features Maher himself,
along with Affleck, author
Sam Harris, MSNBC political analyst Michael
Steele and NewYork Times columnist Nicholas
Kristof It opens with Maher saying that
liberals have failed themselves because they've
been unable to protect liberal principles, like
freedom of speech, freedom to practice any
religion, etc.
Pause.
The debate begins by framing a discussion
on Islam, specifically radical Islam in the
Middle East, by centering it on American
liberalism. The panel, who are all presumably
experts on the topic, is made up of five non-
Muslim men.
Play.
Sam Harris picks up right after Maher,
saying, "We have been sold this meme of
Islamophobia, where every criticism of the
doctrine of Islam gets conflated with bigotry
toward Muslims as people." Ben Affleck, yes,
that Ben Affleck, attempts to counter, saying,
"So you're saying Islamophobia is not a real
thing?" Maher smugly answers, "It's not a real

thing when we do it."
Pause.
The name of the game is positioning. Maher
and Harris dominate the debate because it
centers on the United States and operates under
the assumption that the West is the authority
responsible for combating the primitivity of
Islam. It presumes that Maher and co., who do
not have any actual connection to this issue,
have authority on the subject, and as such they
know better by default. Fortunately, they prove
the opposite every time they opentheir mouths.
Play.
Harris interjects, "We have to be able to
criticize bad ideas. Islam at this moment is the
motherload of bad ideas." Kristof rebuts by
saying, "The picture you're painting is to some
extent true but is hugely incomplete." They go
back and forth until Bill Maher declares, "Let's
get down to who has the real answer here. A
billion people you say, all these billion people
don't hold these pernicious beliefs? That's just
not true, Ben."
Pause.
Yes, let's talk about bad ideas. A bad idea is
making generalizations about a billion people.
There are certain buzzwords that are invoked
when Islam is covered; they generally begin
with Muslim women, followed by LGBTQ,
followed by apostasy, followed by the mother of
all buzzwords: jihad.
Herein lies the root of my discomfort. Maher
is not the only member of the mainstream
media that invokes this type of discourse
when it comes to Islam. This discourse
operates under the presumption that the
Muslim world is homogenous. It denies the
simple idea that Muslims live complex lives.
The examples are never nuanced; there is

SEND LETTERS TO: TOTHEDAILY@MICHIGANDAILY.COM

An apology on behalf
of Michigan Football
TO THE DAILY:
Foryears,the University community
has beentold to "Give it. Get It. Expect
Respect." Football players are not
exempt.
What happened at Spartan Stadium
on Saturday was unacceptable. Never
mind the team's performance. Planting
a sharp object into the grass atan away
game before the game and refusing to
shake hands with the opposing team
after a loss are just plain wrong, and
more so because Michigan State is a

rival. The football program represents
the University'of Michigan, both the
institution and the people associated
with it. The massive showof disrespect
on Saturday is ablack eye for us all.
When I was in East Lansing this
past weekend, Spartan fans treated
me with nothing but kindness (and a
lot of harmless teasing). Even when I
was at that school down south, inside
the stadium for the rivalry game a
few years ago, the Buckeye fans were
pretty nice. Yes, every school has
a few fans who are complete jerks,
and maybe I was just lucky in avoid-
ing them, but it may be time that the
team took a few hints from its rivals'

better fans.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke said
he was "not fully aware" of what
happened. Be more aware and hold
the team accountable for its actions.
That's the head coach's job!
I know you're better than this,
Michigan Football. On behalf of
many, many Michigan fans, I apolo-
gize for the team's actions. It would
be extremely disappointing if an
apology from Coach Hoke does not
follow soon.

South Africa mourns death
of nat'l soccer team captain

JESSICA HILL/AP
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie answers questions from the media about nurse Kaci Hickox's quarantine as Republican
candidate for Connecticut governor Tom Foley, right, listens Monday in Groton, Conn.
U.S. governors, Army go
beyond Ebola guidelines

CDC's suggestions
attempt to create
national standards
NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The
federal Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention on Monday
recommended new restrictions
for people at highest risk for
coming down with the virus,
and symptom monitoring for
those at lower risk. But some
state governors and even an
Army commander have gone
beyond that guidance.
As contradictory state poli-
cies proliferate in response to
Ebola fears, the CDC's recom-
mendations mark an effort to
create a national standard, one
that would protect public health
without discouraging people
from helping fight its spread
overseas.
The CDC now says even if
they have no symptoms and are
not considered contagious, peo-
ple should stay away from com-
mercial transportation or public
gatherings if they have been in
direct contact with the bodily
fluids of someone sick with
Ebola - say by touching their
fluids without protective gear,
or by suffering an injury from a
contaminated needle.
Absent that direct contact,
simply caring for Ebola patients
or traveling in West Africa
doesn't warrant quarantine con-
ditions, the public health agency
said.
But quarantines are deter-
mined state by state in the U.S.,
and the CDC is only empowered
to issue guidelines. And even
within the federal government,

authorities were improvising
Monday: a U.S. Army command-
er in Italy said he and all his
troops returning from Liberia
would remain in isolation for 21
days, even though he feels they
face no risk and show no symp-
toms.
A nurse who volunteered
with Doctors Without Borders
in Africa was released after
being forced to spend her week-
end in a tent in New Jersey upon
her return, despite showing no
symptoms other than an elevat-
ed temperature she blamed on
"inhumane" treatment at New-
ark International Airport.
President Barack Obama has
told his Ebola team that any
measures involving health care
workers should be crafted to
avoid unnecessarily discourag-
ing people from responding to
the outbreak.That'salreadyhap-
pening, Doctors Without Bor-
ders said Monday: some medical
workers are reducing their time
in the field to include potential
quarantines afterward.
"The best way to protect us is
to stop the epidemic in Africa,
and we need those health care
workers, so we do not want to
put them in a position where it
makes it very, very uncomfort-
able for then to even volunteer
to go," said Dr. Anthony Fauci,
director of the National Insti-
tute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases.
But the governors of New
York and New Jersey defended
their quarantine policies as
necessary precautions in deal-
ing with a virus that already
has killed nearly half the over
10,000 people infected this year
in West Africa. Maj. Gen. Darryl

Williams told The Associated
Press that the decision to iso-
late returning troops was taken
to ensure their family members'
comfort, even though none is
showing symptoms, and he does
not believe any soldier under his
command is at risk.
Speaking by telephone from a
U.S. base in Vicenza, Italy, Wil-
liams said he and his soldiers
will be living in isolation under
controlled monitoring during
the three weeks it takes to be
sure Ebola hasn't infected them.
Williams returned to Italy Sun-
day with 10 soldiers with anoth-
er 65 due back in two groups by
Saturday.
It's just "normal concern,"
Williams said. "There was noth-
ing elevated that triggered this
increased posture."
A senior defense official said
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel
is expected to review the recom-
mendations on Ebola, but has
made no decision. The official
was not authorized to discuss
the matter publicly so spoke on
condition of anonymity. White
House spokesman Josh Earnest
said the Pentagon's policy on
isolating returning personnel
has not been settled and imple-
mented yet.
Also absent is any uniform
response within the United
States to the increasing number
of people and medical volunteers
returning from Ebola-stricken
countries in Africa.
"The response to Ebola must
not be guided primarily by
panic in countries not overly
affected by the epidemic,"
said Sophie Delaunay, the U.S.
director of Doctors Without
Borders.

Police launch
manhunt Monday
for murder suspects
JOHANNESBURG (AP)
- The shooting death of the
beloved captain of South Afri-
ca's national soccer team dur-
ing an apparent house robbery
stunned a country long accus-
tomed to violent crime, and
police launched a manhunt
Monday for the intruders.
Charismatic goalkeeper
Senzo Meyiwa was known
for his athleticism and easy
way with fans, teammates and
coaches, and his slaying deliv-
ered yet another blow to the
national sports scene.
The 27-year-old Meyiwa
was killed about 8 p.m. Sunday
after two gunmen entered the
house of his girlfriend, Kelly
Khumalo, a South African
singer and celebrity, authori-
ties said. He was shot in the
upper body, and the gunmen,
along with an accomplice who
had waited outside the home
in Vosloorus township near
Johannesburg, fled on foot,
according to police.
"Words cannot express the
nation's shock at this loss,"
President Jacob Zuma said in a
statement, leading the national
grief for Meyiwa.
Zuma urged law enforce-
ment authorities to "leave no
stone unturned" in finding
the killers, and police offered
a reward of nearly $23,000 for
information leading to their
arrest and conviction.
South African sports offi-
cials had already expressed
sadness at the saga of Oscar
Pistorius, the double-amputee
Olympic runner who fatally
shot girlfriend Reeva Steen-
kamp last year. Following a
tumultuous and emotional
trial, Pistorius began serving

a five-year prison sentence
Oct. 21 after being convicted
of culpable homicide, or man-
slaughter; prosecutors who had
sought a murder conviction
plan to appeal.
On Friday, former 800-meter
world champion and Olym-
pic silver medalist Mbulaeni
Mulaudzi died in acar crash.
South Africa hosted the
World Cup soccer tourna-
ment in 2010 with relatively
little incident, dispelling visi-
tors' fears amid a decade-long
decline in violent crime. How-
ever, police said last month
that there were 17,000 killings
in the year ending in March,
a 5 percent increase over the
previous year in a country of 53
million.
Crime affects people of all
walks of life in South Africa,
which suffers deep economic
inequality and has struggled
to meet expectations of better
opportunities after the end of
white racist rule in 1994.
On Oct. 19, Jackson Mthem-
bu, a member of parliament
and a former spokesman for
the African National Congress,
was shot during a robbery at an
ATM in the country's east, the
party said. He drove himself to
a nearby hospital for treatment.
Last year, the home of Des-
mond Tutu, the retired Angli-
can archbishop and Nobel
peace laureate, was burgled
while he and his wife slept.
They were not harmed.
Meyiwa was shot at Khum-
alo's home while trying to stop
armed intruders who demand-
ed cellphones and money, said
friend Tumelo Waka Madlala,
who was inside.
"As they were running away,
we tried to stop them and that'
is when they shot him at point
blank range," Madlala told The
Associated Press.
Meyiwa was shot as another
person struggled with one of

the assailants, and as the soc-
cer captain moved toward the
door, said police Maj. Gen.
Norman Taioe, a top detective
working on the case.
"We don't have anything
that would suggest he was the
direct target," Taioe said. "It
was during the struggle that a
shot went off."
Two more shots were fired
outside the house, which has
no gate, he said.
There were seven people in
the house before the intruders
entered, according to police.
No one else was hurt. A cell-
phone was taken.
Gen. Riah Phiyega, the
national police commission-
er, said Meyiwa's killing was
a blow to the "brand" and
"image" of South Africa, add-
ing it was important to show
the world that authorities were
moving aggressively to solve
the case.
"They will be keen to know
what we are doing as police,"
Phiyega said at a news confer-
ence.
Meyiwa's father told TV
station eNCA that his son was
providing financial help to his
family, and he wept and had to
be comforted by a journalist.
The goalkeeper was recently
made captain of the South Afri-
can national team, known by
its nickname of Bafana Bafana,
and led it in four African Cup
of Nations qualifiers this year.
He hadn't surrendered a goal
in the four games, keeping the
team on top of its group and on
course to qualify for next year's
continental championship.
He also played for the Sowe-
to-based Orlando Pirates, one
of South Africa's biggest clubs.
Meyiwa put in a strong perfor-
mance in his last game, a 4-1
win over Ajax Cape Town on
Saturday that sent the Pirates
to the semifinals of the Telkom
Knockout cup competition.

Syrian rebels clash with
government troops, 35 die

Rebel factions
launch attacks in
city of Idlib
DAMASCUS, Syria (AP)
- Members of the al-Qaida-
linked Nusra Front and other
Syrian rebel factions launched
simultaneous attacks on army
checkpoints, police headquar-
ters, and the governor's office
in northwestern Syria on Mon-
day, triggering hours-long
clashes that left 35 troops and
rebels dead.
The attacks all took place
in the city of Idlib, activists
and state media reported. The
city, which is in Syrian govern-
ment hands, is the local capital
of Idlib province. Monday's
attacks were the most serious
there since Syrian rebels took
control of scores of villages and
towns around it more than two
years ago.
The fighting is separate from
the clashes underway between
Nusra Front's main rebel rivals,
the Islamic State group, and
Syrian Kurdish fighters for
control of the strategic border
town of Kobani, further to the
east and along the border with
Turkey.
The Britain-based Syr-
ian Observatory for Human
Rights said Nusra Front and
other groups shelled Idlib and
simultaneously attacked army
checkpoints there. It said four
Nusra Front members blew
themselves up inside the city,
targeting checkpoints there

and causing casualties among
the troops.
"It was a moral blow to the
regime," said activist Asad
Kanjo, based in the town of
Saraqeb, also in Idlib province.
He added that calm had been
restored in the city.
Syria's pro-government Al-
Ikhbariya TV cited the provin-
cial police chief, who was not
named, as saying the attackers
took advantage of a power cut
before dawn to hit the check-
points and also the governor's
office. He added that troops
repelled the attackers.
"There isn't one gunman in
the city now," said the police
chief. The TV later aired foot-
age from Idlib showing bod-
ies of two purported attackers
with suicide vests.
The Observatory said the
rebels were helped by some
policemen who were protect-
ing the police commend and
the governor's office enter the
two buildings. The buildings
were retaken later by govern-
ment troops.
Another activist in Idlib
province, speaking on con-
dition of anonymity for fear
of reprisals, said most of the
attacks took place on the south-
ern edge of the city, near Mas-
toumeh Hill.
The Observatory said the hill
was captured by rebels, which
prompted Syrian helicopter
gunships to target the site. It
said 15 rebels and 20 soldiers
were killed at the hill.
Syrian state TV said govern-
ment forces repelled the attack

on Idlib and that a "large num-
ber of terrorists" were killed.
The government refers to the
rebels as terrorists.
State TV said the attackers
were led by Abu Waleed al-Libi
who was killed in the battle -
al-Libi is Arabic for "the Liby-
an." The Observatory said that
some of the Nusra Front mem-
bers killed in the fighting were
foreigners.
In the eastern province
of Deir el-Zour a car bomb
exploded near a hospital run
by the Islamic State group
killing four people including
a child and wounding oth-
ers, the Observatory said. The
explosion in the town of May-
adeen caused material dam-
age to the hospital and nearby
homes.
Syrian state TV said the blast
in Mayadeen occurred outside
a medical center run by the
Islamic State group. The chan-
nel said there are reports of 20
people killed by the blast.
The state channel and the
Observatory gave no further
details.
The Islamic State group con-
trols wide areas of the oil-rich
Deir el-Zour province, where
some tribesmen rose against
the extremist group but were
quickly crushed.
In Kobani, an Associated
Press journalist on the Turk-
ish side of the border said there
was intense fighting in the
town Monday. Sporadic explo-
sions and occasional cracks of
gunfire could be heard from a
distance.

I was lucky enough to catch a
performance/screening of "The
Rocky Horror Picture Show"
along with hundreds of other
people (mostly Central Michi-
gan University students) in
beautiful Mt. Pleasant over the
weekend. For those of you who
bury your heads in a pumpkin
patch every Halloween, "Rocky
Horror" is a sexually-charged,
entertaining-as-hell '70s musi-
cal that has gained probably
the largest and most enduring
cult following of any film ever.
Put on by a theater group at
CMU, the show I attended on
Saturday had a 45-minute, four
part costume contest(with'
winners that included Swedish
Chef from The Muppets and
"Sexy" Finn from "Adventure
Time"), toast, rice and play-
ing cards tossed around the
theater at appropriate times in
the film and a cadre of hecklers
stationed in the balcony. Add all
that to a "shadow cast" miming
everything that was happening
in the film on a stage in front
of the screen and the show was
one of the most uniquely enter-
taining events I had ever seen.
(The State Theatre does a yearly
"Rocky Horror" screening as
well, but its lack of a shadow
cast and pricey prop bags meant
that it paled in comparison to
the one I saw in Mt. Pleasant.)
One thing that isn't particu-
larly unique about "Rocky Hor-
ror," though, is the music. Most
of the numbers are generic
old-school rock 'n' roll songs.
So generic, in fact, that one of
the hecklers' "call-backs" is a
"Greased Lightning, go Greased
Lightning!" that fits in perfectly
with a song's beat. In fact, if
one watches the movie without
a massive audience, one might
think that, without the musical
element, "Rocky Horror" would
still be the weird, campy phe-
nomenon it is today.
No way. If the film was just a
science-fiction B-movie parody/
tribute, sans music, we'd hear
the phrase "Rocky Horror"
today and think someone was
talking about a loose woman in
the Colorado Mountains.
I've been listening to the
"Rocky Horror" soundtrack
practically nonstop since I got

back from CMU, and I've found
that I'm mentally filling in all
of the "call-backs" from the
theater's extravaganza. It just
seems so wrong on its own. I'm
listening to "Over At the Fran-
kenstein Place" and hearing
the echoes of some guy yelling
"Hey Janet, what's up yer ass?"
and I have to fight the urge to
yell "Fuck the back row!" when
"Science Fiction/Double Fea-
ture" is playing in my ear.
I noticed the need for com-
pany more than anything
during "Time Warp," an early
show-stopper. All the costumed
fans get out of their seats and
follow the directions of the
song. Jump to the left, step to

the right, put your hands on
your hips ("Ohhhhhhhhh shit!"
we scream), bring your knees
in tight. Follow that with some
pelvic thrusts (while chanting
"group sex, group sex, group
sex") and all of a sudden I felt
perfectly at home with all these
weirdos, performing incompre-
hensible rituals and bonding
over a shared love of camp and
bad taste
Weirdly enough, I felt the
same way when I saw Pearl
Jam play at Joe Louis Arena
over a couple weeks ago. You
see, I grew up with all of the
classic '90s grunge and alter-
native bands playing on the
radio - Pearl Jam, Nirvana,
Red Hot Chili Peppers, even a
little Sublime. And don't even
get me started on "Smooth."
But the effect of those songs
being drilled into my head
from such a young age is that I
pretty much hate all of them.
I'll change the station imme-
diately ifI hear the opening
chords to "Smells Like Teen
Spirit." I'll roll my eyes at "Give
It Away." I'll probably puke if
I hear Eddie Vedder sing "Jer-
emy spoke in class today" again
(which thankfully, he didn't do
in Detroit).
I'm not trying to take any-
thing away from these classic
songs, but I've chewed on the
music so much in my life that
it's become entirely flavorless.
To that end, before the show I
was loudly proclaiming that I
didn't want to hear anything
from Ten, Pearl Jam's first and
most recognizable album.
Cut to over two-and-a-half
hours into the concert (that's
btt a typo - the lsiidi'was that
spectacular), and Pearl Jam is
playing "Alive," that song you
know even if you're not sure if
you know it. Mike McCready
is playing the guitar solo that
closes out the song, and it's a
solo that I've heard probably,
hundreds of times before, but
he's playing it with this entirely
different kind of power and
energy. The notes are the same,
but flannel-wearing fans are
holding up their mostly empty
beer cups and pumping their
fists and singing along and I
realize this song is a classic!
And I'm so happy to be witness-
ing this performances with
thousands of other people who
love Pearl Jam and know all
the words and are just so happy
to be seeing this band live in
concert.
Music brings us together like
that. There's a reason so many
couples are brought together by
one person inviting the other
to dance. There's a reason why,
when 110,000 people are shout-
ing in unison at The Big House
on Saturdays, they're singing
along to a fight song. Music
gives us a shared ecstasy that
opens new doors of friend-
ship, love and camaraderie.
At "Rocky Horror" the songs
forced us to be weird together,
first awkwardly then with reck-
less abandon, and at the Pearl
Jam show, the old '90s classics
they played were beloved by
everyone in attendance (myself
included, eventually) and gave
the crowd a chance to let loose
and remember how great the
band's work is.

At parties, or any other
kind of social event, we need
music because it starts us off
on the right foot with strang-
ers, because we remember all
the other good times we've
had while we're listening to it
and, most importantly, so when
that week's No. 1 hit song (or
even something as old-school
dorky as "Don't Stop Believin'
") comes on we can sing along
with people with barely know
and people we love and bond
over danceable drumbeats and
soaring, crescendoing choruses.

Why We Should Write About Music

By BRIAN BURLAGE
Daily Arts Writer
In their sprawling
investigation into the life of
Jim Morrison, No One Here
Gets Out Alive, authors Jerry
Hopkins and Danny Sugerman
compare the volatile lead singer
of The Doors to Dionysus,
the Greek god of wine. The
two authors draw many
parallels between Morrison
and Dionysus, a few of which
include physical appearance
(both are frequently bearded,
*robed), obsession with ritual
madness and ecstasy, the power
they each have over their
cultish following and a reliance
on artistic epiphany. (Morrison
would often improvise poetry
during his performances.)
Among the many commonalities
between Morrison and
Dionysus, however, Hopkins
and Sugerman advance one in
particular, 'a singular notion
that links music in the previous
century with Greek antiquity
and mythology - Dionysus
is a dying god, a deity that
voluntarily departs from
Olympus and never returns.
For over five decades now,
the mystery surrounding
Morrison's death has placed
him in similar legendry. He
died alone in a bathtub in
Paris, where the coroner's
speculation as to the cause of
death produced conflicting
stories, and where Morrison's
:long-term girlfriend, Pamela
Courson, never disclosed the
details of his burial. Much like
the god himself, Jim Morrison
seemed to vanish from the
earth.
Engineer Glen Snoddy, who
produced country music in
Nashville in the early '60s,
invented distortion as it is
understood today. As he and
Marty Robbins were recording
"Don't Worry" in the studio,
one of the amplifiers suddenly
blew out. Instead of scrapping
the recording and replacing
the amp, Snoddy kept the tapes
rolling and used the jarred
sound anyway. Robbins's guitar
*sounds fuzzy, electrically
slowed and even a bit sour. But
it was a hit with the public,
and became a No. 1 country
sensation and reached No. 3
on the pop charts. Demand
for this new "distorted" sound
0grew among recording artists.
Pressed for a legitimate
business solution, Snoddy
created a foot pedal that could
be activated with the touch of
a button. He sold the Maestro
Fuzz-Tone FZ-1 to Gibson as
music's first functional guitar
pedal.
Three years later The Rolling
Stones released "(I Can't
Get No) Satisfaction," which
featured the same infant fuzz-
toneusedin "Don'tWorry."Jack
Doyle, in describing the birth
of "Satisfaction," once wrote,
"The guitar riff developed
by Richards in any case, was
initially not set for guitar, but
thought as a guide for horns."
The invention of the new fuzz-
tone served Richards's intent
perfectly - a sonic convergence
of the shrillness of horns and
the snakelike bite of the electric
guitar. Butpopularnewspapers,

magazines, tabloids and prints
ut their own spin on the
new sound, and declared it
righteous, an embodiment of
youthful protest, a brave step
forward for counter-cultural
music; it became representative
of the political "dissatisfaction"
of youth in the 1960s. And so it
was, one of rock 'n' roll's most
pivotal songs was born of the
failed mechanics in a Nashville
country studio a few years
before.
Chuck Cleaver and Lisa
Walker have been playing music
together for 13 years. Their
band, Wussy, a garage/indie/
folk/pop outfit from Cincinnati,
is composed of members that
are well above the age of 30,
'erhaps even 40. Cleaver and
Walker work regular jobs from
nine to five, and once a year
they reunite to collaborate on
a new album (this year's Attical
brings the total to six). Even
their Cincinnati-based record
abel, Shake It Records, reflects
the band's sense of age: the
label's Twitter page encourages
visitors to "use the phone" as

Music criticism, over the years, has developed into an art form in its own right.

opposed to instant messaging,
since the .label's executives
rarely communicate digitally.
Robert Christgau, in his
review of their latest album
Attica!, noted that the album's
opener "...remembers, as Lou
Reed once put it, how a life was
saved by rock 'n' roll." Similar
praise came from Los Angeles
Review of Books contributor
Charles Taylor in his tribute
to the band, in which he wrote
that Wussy's music "...brings
you immediately back to the
way we received rock 'n' roll as
solitary adolescents, as if the
songs were radio transmissions
from a resistance we hadn't
dared to hope existed."
Christgau and Taylor - each
prominent advocates of the
band and absolute forces in
the world of music journalism
- have brought Wussy's music
into the national spotlight,
noting the irony that a band
so removed from the modern
digitized world should make
music so intensely in-tune with
what it lacks.
In a sense the stories of Jim
Morrison, Glen Snoddy and
Wussy point to a larger truth
about music: that in the last 60
years, writing about its many
wondrous characters, trends
and events has diffused its
cultural and artistic appeal
at an unprecedented rate.
Lead singers have been put
on par with Greek gods, the
invention of a small foot pedal
helped spark a countercultural
movement, middle-aged
hobbyists have been credited
with rock 'n' roll's resurrection
and among all these anecdotes,
elevation emerges as the key
distinguishing feature. Writing
about music, whether online
or in print, has, over time,
elevated music, musicians,
the musical process and
overarching influences to their
own levels of mythological
importance. The long tradition
of decades-old publications
like Rolling Stone and Robert
Christgau's Consumer Guide,
in combination with the digital

and strategic innovation
of newer online zines like
Pitchfork, have made the
art of writing about music as
influential as the music itself.
This effect of flip-flopping
influences extends back to the
pioneer work of one of music's
first rock 'n' roll critics, Lester
Bangs. Two years after Rolling
Stone magazine launched in
1967, Bangs responded to an ad
that called for Stone readers
to submit their own reviews.
He wrote a piece on MC5's
album Kick Out The Jams, and
it became the first of his many
scathing reviews (which would
eventually get him fired). In
his short 13-year journalistic
career, Bangs contributed to
Creem, The Village Voice,
Penthouse, Playboy and New
Musical Express. He flouted
conventional journalism of
the time, and described his
own process openly: "Well
basically I just started out to
lead an interview with the most
insulting question I could think
of. Because it seemed to me that
the whole thing of interviewing
... was groveling obeisance
to people who weren't that
special, really." He sabotaged
live performances, accused
popular bands of plagiarism,
disputed evaluations with
high-end bosses and editors,
kept a poorly trained dog in the
office and he even recorded his
own punk rock album in Texas
(before the Ramones or Sex
Pistols were even an idea).
Bangs's enduring
contribution to music is rooted
in this ardency with which he
tried to demythologize rock
stars and their astronomical
personas. Perhaps the most
famous example of this was his
"Let Us Now Praise Famous
Death Dwarves" interview
with Lou Reed, a purposefully
tense interaction that produced
nothing but piss and vinegar
between the two. Bangs was
nearly obsessed with Reed's
Metal Machine Music, which
he wrote about frequently and
reverently. But he was even

more obsessed with getting to
the man behind the sunglasses
and exposing him for what
he was, or rather, what Bangs
thought he was: a regular guy.
Many critics have since
wrought their cheap imitations
of Bangs and tried to rally
against those same supreme-
rock personas, but few have
done so with such influence.
Robert Christgau, who started
around the same time as Bangs
in the late '60s, is among the
few. Christgau - the Dean of
American Rock Critics - has,
for nearly 50 years, written
about music ranging from Iggy
Azalea's pop fetishism to West
African Soweto, from '80s New
Wave to '90s art rock.
Christgau's critical
methodology is simple: first,
you have to know what you
like, and second, you have to
be able to explain why you
like it - "even if the reason
is completely disgraceful."
Many of his most "disgraceful"
reviews, in fact, have utterly
perturbed the various artists
and bands themselves. Lou
Reed - who seems to have had
a penchant for aggravating
music critics, and vice versa --
once ranted about Christgau's
"toe fucker" character in one
of his performances at The
Bottom Line in New York,
which eventually became
his third live album, Take No
Prisoners. As it turns out, a few
months prior, Christgau had
graded Reed's latest album,
Street Hassle, and given it a B+,
calling it "muddled" and "self-,
serving."
Similarly, in the late '80s
Christgau took to Sonic Youth
to call them "pigfuckers" in
his decade-end feature about
music in the '80s, and needless
to say, none of his name-calling
was well received by the band.
In 1983, in fact, they released
their third EP called Kill Yr
Idols, the title track of which
was originally called "I Killed
Christgau with My Big Fucking
Dick." Thurston Moore sings,

decimal grade system.
In fact, the infamous
Pitchfork review system
spawned a Pitchfork reviews-
review website that provides
"accurate/undeniable coverage
of Pitchfork reviews" and
now has its own book deal.
At the same time, bands like
Whirr - bands that are aware
of Pitchfork's 1.5 million-
viewers-per-month readership
- respond poorly to the
site's overt criticism. After
theirsfrequent collaborators,
Nothing, received a 6.9 grade

that Pitchfork is "clueless about

While Pitchfork's undeniable

all condamnes," Pater begins,
"we have an interval, and then
our place knows us no more.
Some spend this interval in
listlessness, some in high
passions, the wisest, at least
among the 'children of the
earth' in art and song. For our
one chance lies in expanding
that interval, in getting as many
pulsations as possible into the
given time ... (song) comes to
you proposing frankly to give
nothing but the highest quality
to your moments as they pass,
and simply for those moments'
sake." In this way, writing
about music arrests these
flurrying moments in attempt
to slow their hurried passing.
It takes the frantic rush of life
- however joyous or sorrowful
- second-by-second, sound-by-
sound, and grapples with its
emotional flux, deconstructs
its seismic motion, until even
the shortest of intervals begin
to expand into entire seasons of
human grandeur and beauty.

Hoke, coaches support Bolden

FOOTBALL RECRUITING
Taylor announces
his decommitment

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Editor
By now, everyone has prob-
ably heard of, if not seen, Joe
Bolden's actions before Satur-
day's game against Michigan
State. The junior linebacker
took a black stake and speared
the turf of Spartan Stadium
near the Wolverine sideline just
before the Michigan football
team took the field in its 35-11
loss to the Spartans.
There were talks following
the conclusion of the game that
Michigan State players felt
disrespected, which was one of
the reasons Spartan coach Mark
Dantonio uncharacteristically
went for a late touchdown despite
the game being well in hand with
less than a minute to go.
"As far as the score at the end,
it just felt like we needed to put
a stake in them at that point,"
Dantonio said after the game.
"The little brother stuff, all the
disrespect, it doesn't have to go
in that direction.
"We've tried to handle ourself
with composure. That doesn't
come from the coach. It comes
from the program."
Meanwhile, one room over
in Michigan's postgame press
conference, coach Brady Hole
was asked about the situation
and said he was only aware that
something happened pregame.
He offered little information
other than the fact that "Joe" did
it - referring to one of the four
Joe's on the team's roster.
But early Sunday afternoon,
Hoke issued yet another apology
in what feels like a season filled
with them.
"IspokewithMark(Dantonio)
earlier today and expressed to
him that we meant no disrespect
to his team," the statement said.
"During our regular Friday night
team meeting, one of the topics
presented to motivate our team
was a history lesson addressing

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily
Brady Hake said Saturday he was "aware, but not fully aware" of Joe Solden's pregame routine with a tent stake.

commitment and teamwork in
a tough environment. A tent
stake was presented to the team
as a symbol of this concept. The
stake wasbroughtinto ourlocker
room as a visual reminder, and
one of our team leaders chose to
take it out on the field.
"As the leader of our
football program, I take full
responsibility for the actions
of our team. We believe in
displaying a high level of respect
at the University of Michigan
and unfortunately that was not
reflected by this action prior to
kickoff."
On Monday, Hoke reiterated
hisresponsibilityforthesituation
and said Bolden wouldn't face
disciplinary action. Hoke also
said he wasn't told to issue the
statement, but felt it was the
right course of action because
of his longstanding relationship
with Dantonio.
"I do think it was overblown,"

Hoke said. "Mark and I have
done this in the past. We've
called when we've had some
incidents in this game."
Hoke also clarified the order
of events that took place, saying
he's always the last one out of the
locker room and by the time he
found out the stake was making
its way onto the field, it was too
late to stop it. He took fullirespon-
sibility for the act, not blaming
Bolden for getting caught up in
the emotion of the rivalry.
The support for Bolden
extended beyond Hoke to the
coordinators and players. When
defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison spoke at his weekly
press conference on Monday,
he only had good things to say
about the linebacker.
"I love Joe Bolden, are you
kidding me?" Mattison said.
"Give me a room of Joe Boldens.
Give me 11 of him, just line
(them) up and put them at any

position you want. You're going
to have a lot ofhappypeople, and
me being the happiest."
But despite the internal
support for Bolden, the program
remains in the national spotlight
for all the wrong reasons. While
Michigan's season has been
less than enthralling on the
field, it has stayed in the news
after incidents with Coca-Cola
products, potential concussions
and now, tent stakes. What
happens next is anyone's guess.
Notes: After missing the last
seven games, senior linebacker
Desmond Morgan will receive
a medical redshirt for a hand
injury. Hoke said Morgan will
return for his fifth-year senior
season. ... Freshman cornerback
Jabrill Peppers was removed
from the team's depth chart.
He's been battling an injury for
the last four weeks, but Hoke
said Peppers hasn't yet been
ruled out for the year.

15 visit to Chapel Hill.
Brian Cole, athlete: Ranking:
ESPN (142) Scout (39)
Cole registered one catch
for 50 yards and a touchdown,
but that wasn't enough to lead
the Hawks to victory. Saginaw
Heritage lost, 48-21, and is now
2-7 on the season. After a visit
to Wisconsin, Cole received
a visit Oct. 17 from Michigan
coach Brady Hoke and offensive
coordinator Doug Nussmeier..
Michael Weber, running back:

didn't provide much protection
for his quarterback, as the team
only had 60 yards of offense
in the first half. After the loss,
Newsome was quoted in The
Bridgeton News as saying, "I'm
still committed to Michigan.
If something does happen (to
Hoke), I will sit down with my
parents, we will talk about it
and make a decision. But for
now, that's not something I am
worried about."

MEN'S BASKETBALL
Rutgers' Jordan
has ties to 'M'

Changes to first line possible soon.

By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Tom Izzo and Thad Matta
didn't understand why Rutgers
men's basketball coach Eddie
Jordan wanted to come back to
college basketball.
Jordan had won an NBA
Championship as a player with
the Los Angeles Lakers in the
1980s. He had coached the
Sacramento Kings, Washington
Wizards and Philadelphia 76ers.
For Jordan, the answer was
simple..
"You know, guys, it's my
school."
So now Jordan finds himself
where it all began. In his second
year at the helm of Rutgers,
his alma mater, he's trying to
resurrect a forgotten program.
The Rutgers program wasn't
always in the desolate state it
is now. When Jordan played
for the Scarlet Knights from
1973-77, Rutgers fielded some
of the best teams in its history,
including the '75-76 team,
which fell to Michigan, 86-70,
in the Final Four.
For Jordan, it's memories of
that team that remind him why
he's back in Piscataway now.
Jordan was reminded of how
special Rutgers, and that team
.ifarticular, was a few months
za team reunion.

Y'smea :r ;.' lot to me," he said.

Thi6e 'ilowing season,
Rutgers lost Phil Sellers and
Mike Dabney - its No. 1 and
2 scorers, respectively - and
four other seniors. Lacking

leadership, the Scarlet Knights
slipped to 18-10 and missed the
NCAA Tournament. Meanwhile,
Jordan averaged 17.7 points, set
the Rutgers' all-time career-
record in steals and assists
and was named an honorable
mention All-American.
Despite the achievements,
however, Jordan learned
something that helped shape his
coaching career: Leadership and
seniority mean a lot. Without
those attributes, winning will
be tough, especially for his team
this year. A team with just three
seniors.
"It's going to be a tough
challenge for us to win a lot
of games," Jordan said. "And
as you navigate through the
season, coaching your team
from that angle as opposed to
coaching a team that is going to
win 14 (games in the Big Ten).
We might not come close to
that."
Jordan knows this year's
team is along way fromthe 1975-
76 Final Four team. Projected
to finish last in its first year in
the Big Ten, Jordan will have
to temper expectations for his
players.
"You've got to keep their
confidence level up," Jordan
said. "You've got to make things
for them, you have to challenge
them, and maybe that's
coaching across the board, but
when their psyche is down and
they're feeling bad about losing,
you're not talking to kids who
have a lot of confidence about
winning. It's two different
reactions to that. That's what I
have to prepare myself for."
It's going to be a process for
Jordan and Rutgers. He needs
better recruits. He needs better
facilities. He needs time to right
the ship at a place he loves.
"You can't stray from your
plan, meaning you have to
understand where you are,"
Jordan said. "As a coach, I can't
get distracted by people that
don't understand the process."

Pairing together two players
who tallied 60 combined
points last season seemed like
a brilliant idea this offseason to
Red Berenson.
The Michigan coach knew it
would come at a ""t, though:
Sophomore
JT Compher NOTEBOOK
would have to
move from center - a position
he has played his entire career
- to right wing in order to skate
alongside junior center Andrew
Copp. But five games in to the
season, that decision may not
seem so flowery anymore.
Copp and Compher have yet to
tally a goal. The line's only score
came from left wing Dexter
Dancs. However, the freshman
said he believes goals are due
for his line and said it's just "a
matter of time." His teammates
agree.
"You have JT and Andrew,
who are proven scorers," said
senior forward Zach Hyman.
"You have Dexter, who scored
his first goal on the weekend
and is a good player as well. It's
a matter of time before they get
going. They are doing all the
right things."
But Berenson was more blunt.
The veteran coach said line
changes are looming for the
Wolverines and the first line
may get shuffled. He said moving
Compher back to center could be
beneficial.
"We'll see about that,"
Berenson said of moving
Compher away from the wing.
"We're going to talk about that;
whether he gets to go back to
go play a more familiar position
or keep him out on the wing.
... We're not satisfied with our
production."
GOAL REVIEW
FRUSTRATION:
Berenson was
uncharacteristically frustrated
with the Hockey East officiating
after Saturday's 3-2 loss to then-
No. 11 Boston University.

Four goals were reviewed they ta

K EICHEL IS GOOD:
higan knew it had its

hands full with Boston forward
Jack Eichel - a 17-year-old
sensation who is projected to be
a top pick in the 2015 NHL Draft.
The Wolverines, though, held*
him mostlyin check. Eichel only
tallied one point - an awkward,
tip-in goal - which was his
lowest output in a game this
season.
"I was impressed with
Eichel," Berenson said, "and
our 'D' had their hands full.
Copp played against him a lot. I
thought we did a pretty good job
with him."
Added freshman defenseman
Zach Werenski, a fellow
17-year-old: "I mean, it's kind of
hard to explain. He's in another
gear out there. When he wants
to, he can skate right by you like
nothing. Yeah, we did a good
job with him. He had a tip goal,
but ultimately we did a good jok
shutting him down a bit."
And that had the Wolverines
energized, even after the loss.
