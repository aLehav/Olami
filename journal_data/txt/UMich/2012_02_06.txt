UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION
Candidates
vie for empty
regents seats

A GIANT WIN

Six hopefuls to
contend for two
* spots on board
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
Daily StaffReporter
As the 2012 presidential elec-
tion heats up, another election
is starting to gain momentum
as Democratic and Republican
hopefuls vie for two open seats
on the University's Board of
Regents.
Current incumbents S. Mar-
tin Taylor (D-Grosse Point
Farms) and Olivia Maynard (D-
Ann Arbor) will not be running
for re-election in November,
noting that they plan to spend
more time with their fami-
lies and embark on other work
within the community. Regents
serve eight-year terms on the
board that governs the Univer-
sity.
Three Democratic and
Republican candidates are
seeking their party's nomina-
tion. The field will narrow to
two candidates per party fol-
lowing nominating conventions
later this year.
The three Democratic candi-
dates vying for seats are former
Michigan Lt Gov. John Cherry,
Shauna Diggs, a dermatologist
from the Grosse Point area and
Mark Bernstein, a Detroit-area
lawyer.

According to Mark Brewer,
chairman of the Michigan
Democratic Party, new Demo-
cratic regents will continue to
support a number of key party
initiatives if elected.
"The Democrats (on the
board) have been very impor-
tant," Brewer said. "They have
been staunch defenders of
affirmative action, which the
Republicans have opposed.
They have been advocates for
(the) fair treatment of Univer-
sity employees, which is not
always the case for the Republi-
cans on the board."
He added that Democratic
candidates will strive to make
college affordability and acces-
sibility a priority.
"(The regents) have been
advocates for keeping costs
down and makingthe Universi-
ty affordable," he said. "... High-
er education should be more
widely available than it is now."
Despite a long-held Demo-
cratic majority on the board,
he said he doesn't believe the
election of Democratic regents
will be agiven, addingthe party
will work hard to campaign for
their candidates in the coming
months.
"You never take anything for
granted," Brewer said. "... This
is a very competitive two-party
state."
Republican candidates for
regent are Ronald Weiser,

Daily Staff Reporter
When University alum Rachel
Long decided to make dinosaur-
themed Christmas cards for loved
ones last fall, she didn't know that
it'd quickly evolve into an online
greeting card business.
The company, Joy and Rap-
ture, was developed by Long and
fellow University alums Bhavik
Lathia and Colin Roberts and
sells humorous greeting cards
that are mostly science-themed.
Though the website has only been
up for a few weeks, the business
has sold more than $100 in cards,
and is looking to expand and
develop merchandise.
Lathia and Roberts expressed
interest in helping Long develop
future designs after she first
shared her work with them.

LSA junior Aditya
Sathi cinches
nominiation
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily Staff Reporter
In an election held Friday
night, MForward selected
LSA junior Aditya Sathi as its
candidate for president of the
Central Student Government
for the next academic year.
Sathi, who is currently vice
speaker of the CSG assembly,
ran against four other can-
didates and will run in the
campus-wide elections next
month on a platform of oppos-
ing tuition increases, bringing
medical amnesty to campus
and developing student advo-
cacy throughout the state.
"I'm not doing this for the
title ... This is really my oppor-
tunity to give back what the
University of Michigan has
given me," Sathi said.
Engineering senior Zeid
El-Kilani, vice chair of MFor-
ward, stressed that the plat-

form is not final and the
nomination was important
in opening a dialogue on key
issues facingstudents.
"We had five different
candidates up there who all
had really good ideas and
(students) will see some of
the great ideas that we heard
(Friday night)," El-Kilani said.
"When (the platform) comes
out, I think it will be a strong,
intelligent and aggressive
platform."
Chief political strategist
Hari Vutukuru said Sathi can
appeal to a wide breadth of
students.
"I'm extremely satisfied
and proud that our members
today chose someone that rep-
resents the ideals and values
of our party,"Vutukuru said.
The nomination voting,
which eliminates candidates
that receive the lowest num-
ber of votes until one receives
a majority, lasted only one
round as Sathi claimed a
majority in the first round.

PTS to fix
malfunctioning
screens
By TUI
GLASGOW-RADEMAKER
For the Daily
With more than half of the
freshman class living on North
Campus, waiting for the bus at the

Central Transit Center - more
prominently known as C.C. Little
- is a daily routine for many Uni-
versity students.
Though the bus stop was
renovated in 2010, the overhead
screens and touch screen kiosks
implemented as part of update
are not being used to their full
potential, according to the offi-
cials at the University's Parking
and Transportation Services.
Keith Johnson, associate direc-

tor of transportation operations,
said PTS is currently working
to incorporate real-time infor-
mation onto the display boards.
Johnson said a contract was
recently signed with a company
that will make the MagicBus
tracking system more compatible
with the interface of the overhead
boards, a change he anticipates
will be made by the start of fall
semester.

Husband denies
involvement
after wife found
strangled to death
A suburban businessman says
he had nothing to do with the
strangulation of his wife, whose
body was found in her Mercedes-
Benz sport-utility vehicle in a
Detroit alley.
Police in affluent Grosse Pointe
Park have described 54-year-old
Bob Bashara as a "person of inter-
est" in the killing of his 56-year-
old wife Jane.
She was found slain Jan.25, and
so far no one has been charged in
the case.
Bashara tells the Detroit Free
Press he had "absolutely nothing
to do with what happened" to his
wife.
Bashara's lawyer has said he
expects an acquaintance of his
client to be charged with the kill-
ing.
David Griem says he hopes the
acquaintances changing stories
will end suspicions against his
client.
PROVIDENCE, R.I.
Lost Malcom X
speech found at
Brown University
The recording was forgotten,
and so, too, was the odd twist of
history that brought together
Malcolm X and a bespectacled
Ivy Leaguer fated to become one
of America's top diplomats.
The audiotape of Malcolm
X's 1961 address in Providence
might never have surfaced at all
if 22-year-old Brown University
student Malcolm Burnley hadn't
stumbled across a reference to it
in an old student newspaper. He
found the recording of the little-
remembered visit gathering dust
in the university archives.
In the May 11, 1961, speech
delivered to a mostly white
audience of students and some
residents, Malcolm X combines
blistering humor and reason to
argue that blacks should not look
to integrate into white society
but instead must forge their own
identities and culture.

the helicopter pilot who found
them.
Dan Conne said Sunday from
" his hospital bed in Gold Beach
that he and his wife and son
spent the nights huddled in a hol-

low log with nothing to eat, and
considered sacrificing their pit
bull, Jesse, for food.
"She's that good a dog, she'd
have done it, too," Conne said.
JERUSALEM
Israel selects new
air force chief
Israel's military has picked a
new air force chief at a time of
growing tension with Iran.
The military said Maj. Gen.
Amir Eshel, 52, was appointed
January 29 and takes over in
April.
U.S. officials say Israel might
be planning to attack Iran's
nuclear facilities in the spring.
Israel and other countries
believe Iran is developing
nuclear weapons, a charge Iran
denies. Israel views Iran as a
threat because of its nuclear and
missile programs, references to
Israel's destruction by it leaders
and Tehran's support of violent
groups in Gaza and Lebanon.
Defense officials said Eshel
is considered "less enthusiastic
about a possible attack on Iran"
than the current air force chief.

BUS
From Page 1A
While the Ann Arbor Trans-
portation Authority currently
shares use of the stop, the over-
head boards will only display
the schedule of University buses.
Johnson said AATA is indepen-
dently working on its own real-
time bus tracking system and it's
not clear if AATA arrival sched-
ules will also be incorporated
into the screens in the future.
While waiting for a bus back
to North Campus on a recent
cold night, Engineering fresh-
man Mitch Lawyer said he would
appreciate an accurate display of
arrival times on the boards.
"I think it would definitely
be helpful, especially when the
weather's colder," Lawyer said.
"I don't like having to stand out
here and wait for 10, 15, 20 min-
utes."

screen, the devices are rarely
turned on and screens often
appear frozen.
While Johnson said one of
the kiosks has now been turned
on, the touch-screen capabilities
have been locked due to security
issues that arose after the screens
were initially activated.
"There were things displayed
on there other than the Magic-
Bus," Johnson said. "We locked
them down a couple of times and
it was not successful, so that's
why we had taken them actually
offline for a while."
Engineering freshman Francis
Petelin, who rides the bus to the
Bursley Residence Hall regularly,
said he no longer feels he can rely
on the kiosks.
"I don't even bother with
them, to be honest," Petelin said.
Since mid-December, one
kiosk has been running with the
touch-screen capability disabled,
but security provisions are cur-
rently being implemented that
will allow all functions to work
properly, Johnson said. He antici-
pates that the entire kiosk system
will be fully functional within a
month.

World leaders worry
about Israeli attack

Iran refuses to stop
pursuing its
nuclear program
JERUSALEM (AP) - For the
first time in nearly two decades
of escalating tensions over Iran's
nuclear program, world lead-
ers are genuinely concerned that
an Israeli military attack on the
Islamic Republic could be immi-
nent - an action that many fear
might trigger awider war, terror-
ism and global economic havoc.
High-level foreign dignitar-
ies, including the U.N. chief
and the head of the American
military, have stopped in Israel
in recent weeks, urging leaders
to give the diplomatic process
more time to work. Israel seems
unmoved, and U.S. Defense
Secretary Leon Panetta has
reportedly concluded that an
Israeli attack on Iran is likely in
the coming months.
Despite harsh economic sanc-
tions and international pres-
sure, Iran is refusing to abandon
its nuclear program, which it
insists is purely civilian, and
threatening Israel and the West.
On Thursday, Defense Minis-
ter Ehud Barak claimed during
a high-profile security confer-
ence that there is a "wide global
understanding" that military
action may be needed.
"There is no argument about
the intolerable danger a nuclear
Iran (would pose) to the future
of the Middle East, the security
of Israel and to the economic
and security stability of the
entire world," Barak said.
Israel views Iran as a mor-
tal threat, citing Iranian calls
for Israel's destruction, Iran's
support for anti-Israel militant
groups and Iranian missile tech-
nology capable of hitting Israel.
On Friday, Iran's supreme
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
called Israel a "cancerous tumor
that should be cut and will be
cut," and boasted of supporting
any group that will challenge

the Jewish state.
Israel's military intelligence
chief, Aviv Kochavi, warned last
week that Israel's enemies pos-
sess some 200,000 rockets.
While sustained rocket and
missile fire would certainly
make life uncomfortable in
Israel, Barak himself has said he
believes casualties would be low
- suggesting it would be in the
hundreds.
Iran might also try to attack
Western targets in the region,
including the thousands of U.S.
forces based in the Gulf with the
5th Fleet.
To some, the greatest risk is
to the moribund world economy.
Analysts believe an Israeli
attack would cause oil prices to
spike, since global markets so
far have largely dismissed the
Israeli threats and not "price
in" the threat. According to one
poll conducted by the Rapidan
Group, an energy consulting
firm in Bethesda, Maryland,
prices would surge by $23 a bar-
rel. The price of oil settled Fri-
day at $97.84 a barrel.
Iran also could attempt to
carry out its biggest threat: to
shut the Strait of Hormuz, a stra-
tegic waterway through which
a fifth of the world's oil passes.
That could send oil prices soar-
ing beyond $200 a barrel. But
analysts note Iran's navy is over-
matched.
If a surge in oil prices proved
lasting, financial markets would
probably plummet on concerns
that global economic growth
would slow and on the fear that
any conflict could worsen and
spread.
For the U.S. economy, higher
gasoline prices would likely
result in lower consumer spend-
ing, which accounts for 70
percent of U.S. economic activ-
ity. That could have devastating
consequences for an incumbent
president seeking re-election.
Oil disruptions or higher oil
prices will also dent growth in
Asia. China, India, South Korea
and Japan all buy substantial

amounts of Iranian crude and
could face temporary shortages.
The urgency is fueled by a
belief in Israel that Iran is mov-
ing centrifuges and key instal-
lations deep underground by
the summer - combined with
doubts about whether either
Israel or the United States have
the bunker-busting capacity to
act effectively thereafter.
At last week's security con-
ference, Vice Premier Moshe
Yaalon, a former military chief,
said all of Iran's nuclear instal-
lations are still vulnerable to
military strikes. In a startling
threat, he appeared to con-
tradict assessments of foreign
experts and Israeli defense offi-
cials that it would be difficult to
strike sensitive Iranian nuclear
targets hidden deep under-
ground.
American officials acknowl-
edge the current version of its
bunker-buster bombs - con-
sidered the largest non-nuclear
bomb in the U.S. arsenal - may
not be able to penetrate Iran's
heavily fortified underground
facilities. The Pentagon is ask-,
ing Congress to reprogram
about $82 million in order to
make the 30,000-pound bun-
ker-buster bomb more capable.
But U.S. officials also say
there are a number of ways to
cripple or disable the sites, such
as targeting entrance and exit
routes to an underground facil-
ity, rendering it inaccessible.
Israeli officials at the con-
ference asserted that Iran
has already produced enough
enriched uranium to eventually
build four rudimentary nuclear
bombs and - in what would be a
new twist - was even developing
missiles capable of reaching the
U.S.
Amos Yadlin, the former head
of Israel's military intelligence,
said the world needed less dis-
cussion on the issue. "There is
the danger that an escalation
could get out of control," he said.
"Israel should go back to what it
does best: Shut up."

U.S. floats Syrian
coalition proposal

Move comes day
after Russia, China
block Security
Council vote
BEIRUT (AP) - The United
States proposed an internation-
al coalition to support Syria's
opposition yesterday after Rus-
sia and China blocked a U.N.
attempt to end nearly 11 months
of bloodshed, raising fears that
violence will escalate. Rebel
soldiers said force was now
the only way to oust President
Bashar Assad, while the regime
vowed to press its military
crackdown.
The threat of both sides turn-
ing to greater force after Russia
and China vetoed a U.N. Secu-
rity Council resolution raises
the potential for Syria's turmoil
to move into even a more dan-
gerous new phase that could
degenerate into outright civil
war.
The uprising inspired by
other Arab Spring revolts began
in March with peaceful protests
against Assad's regime, spark-
ing a fierce crackdown by gov-
ernment forces. Soldiers who
defected to join the uprising
later beganto protect protesters
from attacks. In recent months,
the rebel soldiers, known as the
Free Syrian Army, have grown
bolder, attacking regime troops
and trying to establish control
in pro-opposition areas. That
has brought a heavier govern-
ment response.
More than 5,400 people have
been killed since March, accord-
ing to the U.N., and now regime
opponents fear that Assad will
be emboldened by the feeling he
is protected by his top ally Mos-

cow and unleash even greater
violence to crush protesters.
If the opposition turns overtly
to armed resistance, the result
could be a dramatic increase in
bloodshed.
At least 30 civilians were
killed yesterday, including five
children and a woman who was
hit by a bullet while standing
on her balcony as troops fired
on protesters in a Damascus
suburb, according to the Brit-
ain-based Syrian Observatory
for Human Rights, an activist
group.
Government forces firing
mortars and heavy machine
guns also battered the moun-
tain town of Zabadani, north of
Damascus, a significant opposi-
tion stronghold that fell under
rebel control late last month.
Bombardment the past two days
has wounded dozens and forced
scores of families to flee, an
activist in the town said.
"The situation is terrifying.
Makeshift hospitals are full,"
said the activist, who only gave
his first name, Fares, for fear of
government reprisal. He said
the town has been under siege
for the past five days and there
is a shortage of food and heating
fuel during the cold winter.
The commander of the Free
Syrian Army told The Associ-
ated Press that, after the vetoes
at the U.N., "there is no other
road" except military action to
topple Assad.
"We consider that Syria is
occupied by a criminal gang
and we must liberate the coun-
try from this gang," Col.Riad
al-Asaad said, speaking by
telephone from Turkey. "This
regime does not understand
the language of politics. It only
understands the language of
force."

Senate candidate Hokestra runs controversial ad

Super Bowl spot
takes aim at
Stabenow's record
on jobs
The portrayal of a young Asian
woman speaking broken English
in a Super Bowl ad being run by
U.S. Senate candidate Pete Hoek-
stra against Michigan incumbent
Debbie Stabenow is bringing
charges of racial insensitivity.
GOP consultant Nick De
Leeuw flat-out scolded the Hol-
land Republican for the ad.
"Stabenow has got to go. But
shame on Pete Hoekstra for that
appalling new advertisement,"
De Leeuw wrote on his Facebook
page the morning of January 29.
"Racism and xenophobia aren't
any way to get things done."
A media consultant who has
advised Democrats also thought
it could prove problematic.
"Some Asian-Americans may
be offended by the stereotype
that is portrayed in the spot,"
said Robert Kolt, who teaches
advertising part-time at Michi-

gan State University and had
previewed a number of Sunday's
Super Bowl ads. "Pete seems like
a nice guy in the ad, but I think
he is wasting alot of money now.
... It's just not Super Bowl-wor-
thy. It's not cute, it's not funny
and it's not memorable."
Hoekstra campaign spokes-
man Paul Ciaramitaro said the
ad is meant to be satirical. Hoek-
stra's Facebook page, which was
getting a mix of praise and criti-
cism for the ad, snapped back
that those "trying to make this
an issue of race demonstrates
their total ignorance of job cre-
ation policies."
"Democrats talk about race
when they can't defend their
records," Ciaramitaro said. "The
U.S. economy is losing jobs to
China because of Stabenow's
reckless spending policies.
China is reaping the reward."
The 30-seco,'" ad was filmed
in California and never men-
tions China directly. It opens
with the sound of a gong and
shows a young Asian woman rid-
ing a bike on a narrow path lined
by rice paddies.
Stopping her bike, the woman

smiles into the camera and says,
"Thank you, Michigan Sena-
tor Debbie Spenditnow. Debbie's
spent so much American money.
You borrow more and more from
us. Your economy get very weak.
Ours get very good. We take your
jobs. Thank you, Debbie Spendit-
now."
The scene then shifts to
Hoekstra telling viewers near
a cozy fire, "I think this race is
between Debbie Spenditnow
and Pete Spenditnot."
The Hoekstra campaign set
up a website, www.DebbieSpen-
dItNow.com, that features the
ad and includes Chinese writ-
ing, paper lanterns, parade
dragons and Stabenow's face
on a Chinese fan. It accuses the
Democratic senator of "pouring
American dollars into the Chi-
nese economy."
Democrats were quick to
challenge the premise of the ad,
referring to Hoekstra's 18 years
in the U.S. House and the fact
that he joined a Washington-
based law and lobbying firm last
year.
"Hoekstra's ad is noth-
ing more than a hypocritical

attempt at a Hollywood-style
makeover because the fact is,
Pete spends a lot," Michigan
Democratic Chairman Mark
Brewer said. "Hoekstra voted
for the $700 billion Wall Street
bailout and voted for trillions
more in deficit spending before
quitting Congress to get rich at a
Washington, D.C. lobbying firm.
Hoekstra is using the big game
to play games with Michigan
voters."
Hoekstra GOP Senate rival
Gary Glenn of Midland struck a
similar theme.
"Saving America from the
Washington, D.C., politicians
who gave us this crippling debt
and deficit crisis, Republican
and Democrat alike, means
Hoekstra and Stabenow should
both get benched," Glenn said in
a release.
In response to the Hoekstra
ad, the state Democratic Party
launched a website, hoekstra-
hoax.com, as well as a 60-sec-
ond Web ad Sunday that shows
a 2010 campaign ad run against
Hoekstra by GOP gubernatorial
rival Mike Cox.
Hoekstra's hoping to get the

same bump from his ad that
now-Gov. Rick Snyder got with
his 2010 Super Bowl ad portray-
ing himself as "one tough nerd."
Both ads were created by media
strategist Fred Davis of Califor-
nia-based Strategic Perception
Inc.
The new ad is a twist on the
anti-Republican "moving jobs
to China" theme that Michigan
Democrats successfully used
against 2006 GOP gubernatorial
candidate Dick DeVos and tried
to use against Snyder in 2010.
This time, the focus isn't on
Republican businessmen send-
ing jobs to China but on what
Hoekstra says is Democratic
overspendingthat has weakened
the U.S. economy.
Stabenow, who's running for a
third term, has pushed for trade
policies aimed at China that
impose duties and penalties on
countries that manipulate their
currency and penalize compa-
nies that steal intellectual prop-
erty from U.S. companies.
The campaign plans to run
the ad over the next two weeks
on cable TV shows targeted at
GOP voters.

t's no secret that many University students come from wealthy
backgrounds. With high tuition prices, not everyone can afford
to attend. While it may be more difficult to admit and enroll
students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, the University
should be doing everything it can to reach out to these students
and let them know there are many financial aid options available
to them. Specifically, the University must do better to increase the
number of students who receive Pell Grants.

Pell Grants are need-based federal funds
dedicated to underclassmen for student
expenses. The majority of students who
receive Pell Grants come from families who
make a household income of under $30,000
annually. Some students whose families earn
between $30,000 and $60,000 also qualify.
As the income level rises above $60,000, the
likelihood of receiving a federal Pell Grant
significantly declines.
At the University, many students have the
privilege of coming from well-educated fam-
ilies. Of students enrolled from 2007-2009,
59 percent had a parent who had achieved a
master's degree or above, and 88 percent had
a parent who had achieved at least a bach-
elor's degree. These statistics paint an accu-
rate picture of our student body. Many of the
parents of our students are well-educated
and most likely work in professions where
they are able to adequately provide for their
child's education.
Since only a very small percentage of
students come from families that have not
achieved a level of higher education, only a
few students may be eligible for Pell Grants.
Some may argue that students from wealthi-
er backgrounds are more qualified for admis-

sion to the University. However, that isn't
true. There are plenty of intelligent students
from lower socioeconomic backgrounds that
are just as qualified, yet don't think they will
ever be able to afford a university education.
The disproportionate number of students
from a lower socioeconomic class comes from
a lack of knowledge about the options avail-
able to them. The University has a responsi-
bility to help these students learn how they
can pay for their education.
In order to receive a Pell Grant, students
may not get a full scholarship to their college.
There are only a very limited number of full
scholarships available to students every year.
Without the ability to get a full scholarship,
many students who may excel at the Uni-
versity but come from a household of under
$30,000 in net income may not even apply to
the University, assuming that they won't be
able to afford it.
The University should reach out to schools
specifically located in lower socioeconomic
areas and encourage them to apply, no mat-
ter what their economic background may
be. They should also inform these potential
students of the multitude of ways they can
finance their University education.

Morals of illegal downloads

As the world rapidly advances, the music
business is slowly unraveling and being
driven to oblivion. The change is inevitable,
but has been severely hastened because of
increased illegal music downloading since
the Shawn Fanning case in 2002. In the case,
Fanning, the creator of peer-to-peer file-
sharing service Napster, was sued by multi-
ple artists for freely distributing their music.
While some advocates fight to maintain the
traditional industry, there is no clear-cut
solution to this growing problem.
Despite the Recording Industry Associa-
tions of America's lawsuits, the music industry
has already changed. Since the invention of
online music databases, includinglegal sources
like iTunes, the music industry has irrevocably
changed. People no longer buy a whole album,
but rather, they buy individual songs. They
count the number of songs in a library rather
than the number of CDs on a shelf.
Here at the University, the RIAA has tar-
geted many students for peer-to-peer file
sharing. According to copyright regulations,
violators can be charged up to $250,000 per
infringement. The consequences are severe,
and students understand that the sources
are illegal - they just don't seem to care or
understand the severity of the punishment if
they are caught.
The idea that music is "free" is just too
tempting for a student who is already spend-
ing roughly $40,000 a year to attend college.
As tempting as it may be, there is no fuzzy
line between illegal and legal. If you buy it,
it's legal and if you don't, it's illegal. Sharing,
swapping or borrowing files on non-licensed
sites or burning music on CDs and giving or
selling them to friends is illegal. Despite the
seemingly harmless names, they all translate
to stealing.
Music costs money and people don't
want to pay the high prices. iTunes recent-
ly changed the price of a $0.99 cent song to
$1.29. Not only is this ridiculously high, but
it also makes no sense. How can a song on
a hard copy CD cost less than a song that
doesn't involve packaging, manufactur-
ing or distribution, but is simply purchased
through the Internet? If the music industry
expects people to purchase its music, they
cannot charge $1.29 for a song.
If the average student has about 5,000
songs on their music library and spent $1.29
on every single song, this adds up to $6,450.
So you are either spending $6,450 if you
choose to use legal sources or you are steal-

ing around $6,450 if you are using illegal
sources. Neither option seems desirable.
Artists also have mixed views on music
downloading. The singer Shakira, an advo-
cate for illegal downloading, told the Daily
Mail in 2009, "I like what's going on because
I feel closer to the fans and the people who
appreciate the music."
Similarly in a different era, John Lennon
said, "Music is everybody's possession. It's
only the publishers who think that people
own it."
In today's world, Lennon would likely
advocate for the free distribution of music.
This is somewhat hard to believe given the
millions of albums sold and dollars made by
the Beatles.
Non-mainstream artists believe illegal
downloads project and publicize their music.
Some artists give permission to sites like
Last.FM and Pitchfork to freely distribute
their music. Obviously, an artist has the right
to sell or give away their music, but that must
be their decision.
When Radiohead released In Rainbows in
2007, they chose to release it online for free and
accept donations instead. People don't want to
steal, but they want a fair deal, and Radiohead
did receive donations. People respect the art-
ists and the music, but they just don't want to
pay an exorbitant price for it.
However, another group of artists believe
that illegal music downloading is ruining
the industry. "Our industry must take a very
strong position against the stealing of our
writing and music or else those writings and
music will become as cheap as the garbage in
the streets," Stevie Wonder said.
It doesn't feel like stealing if you take it
over a wire in a digital format. There is noth-
ing tangible like a candy bar taken from a
grocery store, but rather, a somewhat magi-
cal receiving and replaying of a song in a dig-
ital format. There is nothing to touch, only
the sound to embrace. As the illegal music
downloading industry continues to flourish,
the debate goes on and a solution will hope-
fully be adopted.
As for now, students must resist the temp-
tation of downloading all illegal music. As
for the music industry, it must find a way to
make a legitimate profit without gouging the
consumer. Hopefully, some place between
the two extremes can be found, so people can
enjoy music and artists can earn a living.

You know there's a problem
when your elected repre-
sentatives are actively work-
ing to mandate
that the scope
of individuals
susceptible to
discrimination
be broadened.
Unfortunately,
that's what's
happening right
now in the Mich- DANIEL
igan Legislature. CHARDELL
Under Michi-
gan's Elliott-
Larsen Civil Rights Act of 1976,
discrimination on the basis of "reli-
gion, race, color, national origin, age,
sex, height, weight, familial status or
marital status" is prohibited. Notably
absent from that list are sexual orien-
tation and gender identity.
Luckily, cities like Ann Arbor and
Detroit have passed municipal ordi-
nances that extend Elliott-Larsen
to include those individuals who
remain unprotected under current
state law. According to Michigan's
constitution, this is within a city's
rights - each city and village "shall
have the power to adopt resolu-
tions and ordinances relating to its
municipal concerns." If statewide
antidiscrimination law is lacking, at
least protections are being extended
locally, right?
Well, not quite.
Enter state Rep. Tom McMillin
(R-Rochester Hills), the sponsor of
the draconian House Bill 5039. Intro-
duced last October, HB 5039 would
prohibit any state agency or unit of
local government from adopting any
local policies that protect groups not
covered under Elliott-Larsen such as
LGBT individuals. Furthermore, HB
5039 would nullify any existing local
ordinances protecting those groups
not covered by Elliott-Larsen. In
other words, Lansing would throw
Ann Arbor's local protections out

the window. HB 5039 also applies
to public school districts, meaning
that McMillin's proposed legislation
would invalidate and prohibit any
anti-bullying policies pertaining to
sexual orientation or gender identity.
The proposed legislation violates
Michigan's Constitution, so, in legal
terms, I'm not particularly worried
that it will hold up if passed. But I
have some broader concerns with
the principles of HB 5039 - how
it's being sold and what it means for
Michigan.
McMillin claims that he's simply
aiming to standardize the "patch-
work" of civil rights law in place
across Michigan. This coming from
the man who, according to LGBT
newswire Pride Source, served as
the Michigan Christian Coalition
field director from 1994 to 1997, was
instrumental in defeating Royal Oak,
LGBT-friendly Human Rights Ordi-
nance in 2000, sponsored a constitu-
tional amendment banning same-sex
marriage as Oakland County Com-
missioner in 2003 and, regarding
that same resolution, said, "I think
that the people who are caught up in
the homosexual lifestyle need help.
We encourage people to stop smok-
ing. This resolution is the same sort
of thing."
He just wants to help! How con-
siderate.
As an aside, excuse me for finding
it funny that McMillin also serves
as chair of the Michigan House of
Representatives Oversight, Reform
and Ethics Committee. Before that,
he was chair of the Education Com-
mittee. Ethics and education. Yes,
really. Clearly, it's the ethical respon-
sibility of elected representatives
like McMillin to show the children
of Michigan that homosexuality is -
like smoking - an unhealthy addic-
tion that, with the right regulation,
can be discouraged.
In all seriousness, I find it insult-
ing that McMillin would pass off HB

5039 as an innocent effort to stream-
line statewide civil rights, as if that
made sense, anyway. This is an effort
to reverse progress in LGBT civil
rights. McMillin shouldn't get away
with calling it anything butthat.
One week from today, on Feb. 13
at 7:00p.p., the Rochester Hills City
Council will be meeting to consider
adopting a similar resolution oppos-
ing HB 5039. This meeting is crucial.
I encourage anyone interested in
promoting equality and safeguarding
Michigan needs
a state-wide
civil rights law.
civil rights to attend. Rochester Hills
is McMillin's home city. As such, it's
crucial that the City Council oppose
HB 5039, and as cities like Ann Arbor
have already done, show McMillin
that the state does itself no favors
by cutting off access to protection
against discrimination.
University alum Ryan Lecler,
a current Law School student, is
spearheading the campaign in Roch-
ester Hills, where, after defeating
HB 5039, he also hopes to get a city
council resolution granting antidis-
crimination protection to the LGBT
community passed.
With an eye to the future, let's
make this the st rt of a debate on
reforming Elliot Larsen to include
sexual orientation and gender iden-
tity. If anyone truly opposes extend-
ing antidiscrimination protections to
individuals on the basis of sexual ori-
entation and gender identity, I'd love
for you to tell me what year it is and
what country we live in.

able to retrieve "other relevant

The preliminary review
offered four recommendations
that are currently being con-
sidered, including creation of a
common protocol for reporting
breaches of security that arise

potential crimes in the data-
base shared by hospital scurity
and DPS, development of joint
training exercises between DPS
and Hospital Security and the
referring of all future computer

Ora Pescovitz, the University's
executive vice president for medi-

Jan. 30 about the issue and wrote
that she is a proponent for collab-
oration in thorough examination
of the case.
"It is our collective respon-

Maynard added she was

MFORWARD
From Page 1A
sentative Kevin Mersol-Barg, LSA
Assembly Representative Omar
Hashwi and College of Engi-
neering Assembly Representa-
tive Crissie Zuchora also ran for
MForward's nomination.
While only one nominee was
able to emerge as the candidate
for MForward, Walser said the
party remained united.
"(The other nominees were)
probably disappointed," Walser
said. "But I think everyone recog-
nizes Aditya is a great leader."
Currently, none of the four
other nominees will run for presi-
dent with a different party. Singh
said despite her personal loss, she
is looking forward to Aditya's run
for president.
"Aditya will be a great choice
for our presidential nominee,"
Singh said. "I think the nomi-
nation process was very fair ...
(MForward) selected a good can-
didate."
MForward Party Chairman
Sean Walser said Sathi's strong
victory is a sign of the party's
strength.
"The fact that he won a major-
ity with five candidates is indica-
tive of a broad base of support in
the party and indicative of the
great work Aditya has done,"
Walser said.
The last two presidents of CSG,
previously known as Michigan
Student Assembly, have come
from MForward, but this is the
first time in MForward's two-
year existence that more than one
candidate went after the party's
presidential nominee.
Walser said the MForward
candidate for vice president will
be announced later this week,
adding that the vice president
may potentially be an individual
outside of student government.
Brendan Campbell, the CSG vice
president, was the chair of the
University's chapter of College
Democrats before he became vice
president, El-Kilani noted.
Walser and the other mem-
bers of Sathi's election team are
currently unaware of any other
candidates running for presi-
dent, but they expect to face a
candidate from the Defend Affir-
mative Action Party and possibly
a reprise of the ever-popular fic-
tional candidate.
Last year, the Every Three
Weekly developed the fictional

candidate Karlos Marks, who ran
as a write-in candidate. While
Marks did not receive as many
votes as current CSG President
DeAndree Watson, he did win
several elections on campus.
Walser said the Marks cam-
paign showed a disconnect with
students that MForward hope to
overcome this year.
"There are still students that
we need to connect with and
demonstrate why they should
select an actual candidate for
president," Walser said. "(We
need to) demonstrate that CSG
is actually doing a lot of great
work."
Though the election is almost
two full months away, Robert
Bowen, Sathi's campaign manag-
er, said MForward will launch an
extensive campaign. According
to Bowen, students can expect
that he and Sathi will be walk-
ing through the residence halls,
speaking to student leaders and
campaigning on the Diag as a
part of the campaign.
Sathi said he began his college
experience at Wayne State Uni-
versity where he was also a mem-
ber of student government. Upon
running for the student senate at
WSU, Sathi said he decided his
plan to study medicine was no
longer his dream.
"I realized that I wanted to
dedicate my life to service," Sathi
said. "I had this moment where I
realized I can't be pre-med."
Sathi said he was a part of a
program at WSU through which
he received full tuition and was
ensured acceptance into WSU's
medical school before ultimately
deciding the medical field was
not in his plans.
"It was hard to say no to that
program," he said.
Ultimately, Sathi said he
believed a degree from the Uni-
versity of Michigan would be the
best way to fulfill his goals. He is
majoring in political science, with
a minor in community action
from the School of Social Work.
By the time Sathi decided to
transfer, he was the student body
vice president at WSU, a role he
says is similar to his current post
as vice speaker in the CSG assem-
bly. With plans to transfer, Sathi
decided to step down because it
would be "unfair" for him to con-
tinue serving while knowingthat
he would not fulfill his term.
Sathi instead returned to
being a student senator for the
remainder of his time at WSU.

Monday, February 6, 2012 - 5A
During his time at WSU, Sathi
said he worked on programs that
established a 24-hour library and
improved lighting in neighbor-
hoods around campus.
Arriving at the University of
Michigan for the winter 2011
term, Sathi quickly became
involved with student govern-
ment on campus, but said it was
not particularly easy to secure a
position.
Sathi applied to fill an opening
in the Student Assembly through
LSA, but he was not selected.
Instead of representing LSA in
the Michigan Student Assem-
bly, Sathi said he unknowingly
became an associate representa-
tive in LSA Student Government.
"Little did I know that if
you attend three meetings, you
become an associate representa-
tive and you have your own plac-
ard," he said.
Members of LSA Student
Government encouraged him to
attend MSA meetings, Sathi said.
By March, Sathi ran with MFor-
ward for the same seat for which
he had unsuccessfully applied
before. Being new on campus
made the election difficult, but
Sathi said he met this challenge
head-on.
"I was very interested and pas-
sionate about being involved," he
said.
Sathi was elected a repre-
sentative before serving as vice
speaker of the CSG assembly.
During his time on student gov-
ernment at the University, Sathi
has worked on several projects
including ongoing attempts to
bring medical amnesty to the
campus and the promotion of
more involvement with the Stu-
dent Association of Michigan - a
collaboration of student govern-
ments from universities within
the state that advocates for stu-
dent issues.
Sathi has also served as the
recruitment director of MFor-
ward and vice chair of the CSG
External Relations Commission.
As chair of the ERC, Walser
is responsible for publicizing
the election to students and also
plans to be strongly involved in
Sathi's campaign, adding that he
will not let these two positions
overlap.
"I love working with the ERC
stuff, but when I sit down for
MForward stuff I work on MFor-
ward," he said. "I don't want my
work in ERC to be driven by my
work in MForward or vice versa."


Lathia added that there may be
ore than just cards in the future,
entioningthe potential to devel-
merchandise.
"We would love to do a lot of
her things (like) screen print-
g, T-shirts," Lathia said
Since the business launched
ose to Valentine's Day, many of
s cards are romantically themed,
it the business plans to "branch

out," according to Lathia.
Long also said she hopes Joy
and Raptor will be sustainable as
a long-term project, adding that
the business allows her to express
her creative side.
"We're all into dinosaurs, we're
all into biology, and we're all into
nerdy things like that," Long said.
"We're all into design and making
cool things."

Radcliffe returns in
refreshing horror film

By SEAN CZARNECKI
Daily Arts Writer
Nowadays, there are three
types of female stock characters
in the horror genre: the help-
less bimbo, the
protagonist * *
damsel and -
in the case of The Woman
"The Woman in Black
in Black" - the
scary-ass girl- AtQuality16

though direc-
tor James Watkins's ("Eden
Lake") haunted-house tale is one
of the most old-fashioned hor-
ror films in years, its mysterious
atmosphere is chilling enough to
set audiences on edge.
Adapted from the Susan Hill
novel of the same name, "The
Woman in Black" forgoes blood
thrills, machetes and whatever
creative weapon Hollywood
can dream up. There aren't any
sick death traps or killer video-
tapes. And, unfortunately, the
story takes place in turn-of-the-
century United Kingdom, which
sadly excludes the possibility of
radioactive zombies. Instead,
the story follows a well-estab-
lished formula that still man-
ages to entertain. It tells the
tale of a young lawyer named
Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe,
he's freakin' Harry Potter) and
his candlelit search for answers
about a curse that's killing the
children of a remote village.
Most of the scares in "The
Woman in Black" rarely cause
the audience to leap out of their
bones, so to speak. The audience
is well aware that Kipps will hear
a suspicious noise, and that when
he goes to discover its source, he
will find nothing but a rodent.
Plus, the number of times he goes

New musical
theater-based show
fills the 'Glee' gap
By PROMA KHOSLA
Daily Arts Writer
In 2009, "Glee" brought musi-
cals to mainstream television.
The story is a legend: the unprec-
edented rise to
fame, outra-
geous musical
numbers and Sh
subsequent
bastardization Pilot
of everything Mondays at
the show stood 10 P.M.
for. For those
who still want NBC
to love musical
television but believe in organic
storytelling and creative original-
ity: rejoice, for your salvation is at
hand.
NBC's midseason headliner
"Smash" is everything "Glee"
isn't and it's probably many things
"Glee" aspired to be. The plot is
simple: 24-year-old Karen Cart-
wright ("American Idol" runner-
up Katharine McPhee) wants to

make it big on Broadway. There
are no petulant teenagers or life-
and-death sing-offs. There is orig-
inal music (as opposed to straight
covers and shameless pandering)
and quality acting from relative
newcomers as well as veterans of
the stage and screen.
Karen manages to land a call-
back for a new Marilyn Monroe
musical by illustrious Broadway
legends Julia Houston (Debra
Messing, "Will and Grace") and
Tom Levitt (Christian Borle,
"Legally Blonde: The Musi-
cal"). The pair teams up with
director Derek Wills (Jack Dav-
enport, "Pirates of the Carib-
bean"), whom Julia respects and
admires, though Tom harbors
unrestrained loathing for him.
Julia and Tom want to cast
their friend Ivy Lynn (Megan
Hilty, "Broadway's Wicked"), but
Wills wants to have auditions.
His tangible ego makes him the
closest thing to an antagonist,
but he's the first person besides
Karen's charming British-Indi-
an boyfriend (Raza Jaffrey, the
London production of "Bombay
Dreams") to see something in her.
Wills isn't overtly sleazy, but
he does manage to make things

awkward by calling Karen to
his home late at night to capture
the essence of Marilyn. Despite
the compromising situation, she
performs a sultry "Happy Birth-
day" to prove she has the neces-
sary sex appeal, only to inform
Wills as he inevitably leans in for
a kiss that it's "not gonna hap-
pen" (WWMD?). It's one of the
standout scenes of the pilot, but it
requires elaboration: Was it some
kind of test? And, if so, what was
he tryingto prove?
Truthfully, McPhee is too
beautiful and talented to be the
girl next door, just as this role
didn't suit her on "American
Idol" years ago. Wills echoes the
American people in 2006, seeing
that this girl was bornto be a star.
Still, the fact remains that she
was that girl, so playing cautious
hope comes naturallyto her.
The first audition is shown
partially in a room with the judg-
es (who also include a shrewd
and calculating Anjelica Huston,
"The Royal Tenenbaums") and
partially as a staged number. At
first, it seems like a "Glee" tactic
- going back and forth between
real life and the stage - but upon
further inspection, it's genius.
"Smash" actually has a reason to
picture every auditionee as the
star in the spotlight - it puts us
right in the position of the cre-
ative minds behind Broadway's
best, prompting us to visualize
the potential of every performer
with the skill and foresight (and
pressure!) of a casting director.
Karen and Ivy are both excel-
lent choices to play Marilyn, and
therein lies the main conflict of
the pilot. It spends more time on
Karen, a fresh-faced ingenue, so
she's the underdog who garners
the audience's sympathy. On the
other hand, it's hard not to want
to be on the same team as Will
and Grace - I mean Tom and
Julia - so we're forced to take a
second look at Ivy and see that
she too deserves a leading role
afteryears of struggling.
The story isn't surprising by
any means, but in a way, that's
classic Broadway. Is it so bad
to promise aesthetic entertain-
ment and a certain "happily ever
after?" "Smash" has no preten-
tions about pushing the bound-
aries of television drama, so its
strength lies in showcasing the
heart and soul of showbiz. With
such apparent passion behind the
scenes, "Smash" is poised to be
just what the title promises.

Learning to
embrace the art
of calligraphy

Super heroes done right

There are plenty of art
forms that have suc-
cessfully made their
way across countries and con-
tinents - painting, sculpture
and photog-
raphy have
undergone
* countless
variations
as they
have passed
through the
hands of the LAUREN
many people CASERTA
who devel-
oped them
into the styles we see today.
Of course, the same cannot
be said for every traditional art
form, especially those for which
there is no exact cross-cultural
equivalent. Many East Asian
practitioners consider the pro-
cess of creation just as important
as the piece of art that takes
shape, turning the actions of
writing, gardening or even serv-
ing tea into carefully choreo-
graphed displays.
Americans have often been
fascinated by cultures outside
of our own, but the 21st century
has dawned to reveal a rather
kitschy side to our desire for
objects and images from outside
our borders. We love stuff but
would rather forego the emo-
tional or traditional "baggage"
that comes with it. Japanese
calligraphy is a perfect - and
often painful - example of how
an intricately-tuned cultural
tradition can be watered down
into a commercialized, easy-to-
swallow concept once it has left
its natural habitat.
Japan uses three main writing
systems to render language and
meaning. Kanji, a vast collec-
tion of characters that are both
concise and visually beautiful, is
considered the most complicated
of the three. Able to pack a huge
amount of significance into a
single symbol, kanji is the writ-
ing system most commonly used
in Japanese calligraphy.
Unfortunately, it's these char-
acters - which look decidedly
exotic to anyone who grew up
learning the Latin alphabet in
the United States - that also end
up plastered on Asian-themed
Walmart bathroom accessories
and tattooed on your friend's
upper tailbone.
So why do America's com-
mercial tendencies often result
in these grievous cultural misin-
terpretations? It's because what
is essentially a fully developed
artistic ceremony, a carefully
choreographed dance between
brush, ink and paper, has been
diluted down to a final visual
product that is easy to silkscreen
onto mass-produced comforters.
Though many Americans have
been taught to see Japanese cal-
ligraphy as purely visual, it's the
physical and mental process of
putting it to paper in which the
true art form lies.
As a Westerner with a firm
love of the Roman alphabet, this
was a concept I had to see to
believe. I had the opportunity
to watch an instructor and try
it myself during a visit to Japan
in 2008. Though I did quite well
at the beginning, I was quickly
reprimanded for using my left
hand (how do righties live such

an empty life?) and forced to
make the awful switch, making
all my subsequent work look as
though I'd spooked an octopus
over my sheet of paper. ThoughI
know I'll never cut it asa brush-
wielding artist, I did gain a
deep appreciation for an artistic
medium in which process is just
as important as the end product.
Those of us west of the Prime
Meridian don't really have a
cultural equivalent to something
like East Asian calligraphy,
which is just as much a mindset
as it is a fine art. The ceremony
begins the moment you sit down
and lay out your tools in the
correct positions - inkwell and
brushes to the right, paper to
the left. As you mix your ink and
load your brush, your thoughts
must clear as you allow the
meaning of the kanji you have
chosen to crystallize in your
mind and as you concentrate on

New talent gives
'Chronicle' that
something extra
By AKSHAY SETH
Daily Arts Writer
Watching high-school stu-
dents soar around the Seattle
Space Needle isn't what it used
to be. A decade
ago, a certain
measure of awe
came hand- Chronile
in-hand with
walking into a At Quaity16
movie theater and Rave
to see two teen-
agers throw 20th Century Fnx
cars at each
other. Now, itcjustseems like clev-
er CGI trickery. Let's face it - the
yearly rigmarole of big-name stu-
dios bombarding the box office
with at least a handful of super-
hero flicks has had a tiring effect.
Sadly, the increasing number
of caped vigilantes no longer
feels as badass as the comic book
characters we grew up read-
ing about. Even origin stories,
the revelatory tales that give us
a glimpse into how particular
heroes developed their abili-
ties, have started to seem jaded,
weighed down by repeated script
gimmicks and an overwhelming
air of unoriginality. But some-
how, "Chronicle," director Josh
Trank's feature debut, finds a
way to defy the norm.
Unlike many of the taste-
lessly boring superhero adap-
tations released this past year
(our glowering eyes are trained
squarely on you, "Green Lan-

"Wait Madge, is that you?! Wait, what are you doing with Cee Lo?!"

tern"), "Chronicle" is entertain-
ing and meaningful. Perhaps
it's the found-footage format,
never before used in a superhero
movie, that breathes life into the
film. Or maybe it's the exception-
al performances by the young,
talented leads. In any event, it
works exceptionally well.
Dane DeHaan (TV's "In Treat-
ment") plays Andrew, a troubled
high-school geek who struggles
with an abusive father and a
terminally ill mother. While at
a party with his cousin Matt
(Alex Russell, "Almost Kings"),
Andrew befriends high-school
jock Steve Montgomery (Michael
B. Jordan, TV's "The Wire"), and
the three teenagers discover an
otherworldly object that grants
them highly concentrated teleki-
netic abilities.

Andrew is pushed to the lim-
its by his circumstances, and it's
easy to realize why all that pent
up hostility will eventually come
pouring out. In a certain sense,
this dynamic adds a much needed
base of reality to the movie, but in
the long run, it also ends up being
a discernible flaw.
The first 45 minutes of the film
are spent exploring the fun side
of having superpowers: prank-
ing little kids at the supermarket,
flying around the Seattle Space
Needle and rigging the high-
school talent show. It's a fun little
diversion that puts the audience
at ease and seems much more
realistic than three high school-
ers randomly deciding to fight
crime with their newly acquired
abilities.
Nevertheless, the movie picks

up speed quickly, as Andrew
finds it increasingly difficult
to control his ever-expanding
power. And despite the excel-
lently constructed car-toss
scenes and the well-composed
script, this is where the movie
stumbles. Technically, every-
thing goes according to Trank's
plan, but at the end of the day,
it all just seems too rushed.
The audience is given rational
context for how Andrew finally
loses control, but we're never
given a believable reason as to
why. Fortunately, this slight mis-
step isn't enough to make this a
bad movie.
"Chronicle" will always be
remembered as a surprisingly
well-made film. It's just that it
tried to hit a little harder than it
needed to.

Whales saved, plot drowned

"It was important for them to

said. "All those little things

dence builders are what help
them gain experience to know
that when the pressure is on in
some of the bigger competitions,
they can do what they need to
do. This team is getting more
mature every week we go along."
After a strong start on vault
and bars, the balance beam
once again proved to be Michi-
gan's downfall. Though they
improved from last week's dis-
appointing performance, the
Wolverines still had a few slip-
ups and were unsatisfied with
their final score. Nonetheless,
Sampson continued her career-
high night by posting Michigan's
top score for the event.
"I've become very good at
blocking things out and staying
focused, and the rest of the team
is doing that ell too," Sampson
said. "We regettingvbetter and
better each week. We'll get those
little things figured out for next

The Wolverines were fortu-
nate to have freshman Annette
Miele perform on beam, as the
extra score prevented having to
count a fall that could have fur-
ther damaged the team's total.
Going into their final event
on floor, Michigan trailed the
Mountaineers, 146.075-145.825.
Again, the Wolverines had to
dig themselves out of the deficit
while hoping that West Virginia
found similar struggles on beam.

Sampson capped her incred-
ible night by earning first-place
honors on floor, while winning
her first career all-around title
(39.300). Sophomore Reema
Zakharia also joined Sampson
at the top of the podium for the
event.
"I've just been going to the
gym and doing my thing," Samp-
son said. "I'm coming in with a
lot of confidence and treating
each practice like a meet. It's
starting to pay off, and I hope it
continues."
Of course, the night wouldn't
be complete without stellar
performances by Sugiyama and
Zurales, both of whom are accus-
tomed to leading their team back
to victory. Miele, who made her
collegiate debut on floor, was the
final competitor to seal the Wol-
verines' close victory over West
Virginia.
"Bev just said, 'It's your time
to shine, this is what you've
worked for,' " Miele said. "I just
govreally excited. It really just'
pumped me up and maybe gavel
me a little bit too much energy
on my first pass, but I was just
excited."
It seems fitting that Miele
was asked to close out Friday's
narrow contest for her young
team. Three of the Wolverines'
four wins this season have been
decided in the final rotation of
the meet, demanding maturity
and confidence from the inexpe-
rienced squad.
"Every time we do it, it builds
confidence that they can do it
again," Plocki said.

The Michigan women's gym-
nastics team seems to be grow-
ing smaller and smaller by the
week. Three upperclassmen are
injured, there are no seniors, and
there aren't enough gymnasts
with set routines to compete.
The Wolverines have their work
cut out for them.
With only 11 girls on the team,
the recent loss of junior Nata-
lie Beilstein to' a season-end-
ing Achilles injury is a serious
setback. She was one of three
juniors on the squad and a clear
leader figure. She is also one of
the highest-scoring gymnasts on
the floor exercise.
"We definitely had to pick up
what (the injured athletes) left
open for us," said freshman Sachi
Sugiyama. "We have to just keep
a strong mind and know we're
capable of filling in their shoes."
"Every member of this team
fully understands that every
single thingthat they do matters,
that we don't have the luxury of
having a couple of people that
can take a break from an event,"
added Michigan coach Bev
Plocki.
Despite the injuries, the Wol-
verines have been unstoppable
this season
They narrowly defeated West
Virginia, 194.650-194.050, on
Friday night. With a shortage
of gymnasts who are able to
compete, Plocki is pulling out
her secret weapons: freshmen
Annette Miele and Sugiyama.
Sugiyama was put on the
"Gymnasts to Watch" list dur-
ing the preseason and has flipped
and twirled her way to multiple
first-place finishes so far this
season. In last week's meet,
Sugiyama proved to be a key
player, earning first place and a
career high on vault with a score

of 9.925, and winning third on
the uneven bars with a score of
9.800. She tied for third on floor
with junior Katie Zurales scoring
a 9.800. Sugiyama also took third
place in the all-around competi-
tion with a total score of 38.700.
Miele's college career is just
leaping into action. She was
scheduled to compete in the all-
around for the first time this
season, against West Virginia.
Miele was programmed to be the
sixth gymnast to do a routine on
vault, although only the top five
highest-scoring routines would
be counted in the final score.
After her teammates' near-per-
fect vault routines, her perfor-
mance was unnecessary, and
she was pulled from that round
and therefore dropped as an all-
around competitor.
"She is going to get better as
the weeks go along and more
confident in her performance,"
Plocki said. "I think she is going
to end up being a major contribu-
tor for us by the end of the sea-
son."
Miele competed on the uneven
bars, beam, and on floor for the
first time this past weekend.
She did not expect to be a floor
competitor and had to come up
with a routine in just one week,
whipping together some last-
minute- dance movles urns.
Her routine looked flawless and
was good enough to earn her a
9.575 score. Sugiyama and Miele
are growingin importance to the
team as it dwindles in numbers.
"They have to give us every-
thing that they have, but they
also know that we're not going
to push them out there before
they're prepared and before
they're ready," Plocki said. "So
it's just a slower process this
year, but I think this team is get-
ting more mature and more con-
fident every single week that we
go along."

MEN'S TENNIS

WOMEN'S TENNIS

Michigan wins five of six singles matches Slow starts costs

By ALEX STEINHOFF
Daily Sports Writer
Down 5-2 in the second set, it
looked almost certain that Michi-
gan sophomore Barrett Franks
was going to need a third set to
beat his opponent from LSU to
help his Wolverines win the dual
match.
The Michigan men's tennis
team (3-2) was beating the 32nd-
ranked Tigers, (3-1), and needed
only one more win to clinch at 3-2.
But sophomore Shaun Bernstein
was just beginning his third set
after he dropped the second set to
LSU's Neal Skupski. At No. 5 sin-
gles, Franks was most likely going
to follow suit. Franks won the first
set in routine fashion, 6-4, after
breaking Stefan Szacinski's serve
to get a late lead before serving to
win the set. In the second, Franks
was broken in the second game
and went down 2-0. Five games
later, Franks had his back against
the wall.
"To be honest, I was thinking
that as long as I could get through
this service game, I knew the
pressure would be on him to serve
it out," Franks said.
Franks won the next game
handily, and Szacinski missed
several first serves in the fol-
lowing game, failing to close out
Franks and the match to a third
set. Franks had all the momentum
by that point in the match.
Franks drew even at five
games apiece and was looking as
confident as ever, while Szacin-

ski seemed to have lost focus and
any hope of forcing the match to
a third set. Up 6-5, serving for
the match, it was all but over for
Szacinski.
Before Franks served for his
matc, and the dual-match victory,
his Michigan teammates started a
slow clap that echoed through the
Varsity Tennis Center. During the
point, Franks hit a deep approach
shot that allowed him to rush
the net and hit a drop-shot vol-
ley that Szacinski couldn't reach.
The Wolverine sophomore spiked
his racquet in celebration, as his
teammates went out on the court
to congratulate him for clinching
the dual.
Franks' fourth singles win of
the season was the difference in
Michigan's fourth dual victory
this year.
The Wolverines didn't start
off well in the top-30 matchup, as
they dropped the doubles point,
even after the No. 1 team of King
and Bernstein won its eight-game
pro-set.
The No. 2 doubles team of
Franks and sophomore Alex
Buzzi were broken at four-all, and
were never able to break back. At
No. 3, freshmen Alex Petrone and
Michael Zhu were overmatched
and overpowered.
"I thought LSU had really
strong No. 2 and No. 3 teams,
especially their No. 3 team," said
Michigan coach Bruce Berque. "If
we played really well, we would've
had a shot, but you could really see
the difference between men and

freshmen at No. 3."
Despite losing the doubles
point for the first time this season,
the Wolverines responded by win-
ning five of six first sets in singles
play.
"After losing the doubles point,
it's easy to be kind of wander-
ing and be a little bit shaken, but
I think our guys really went after
it and our execution was just bet-
ter," Berque said.
At No. 3 and No. 4 singles,
Petrone and Zhu finished off their
opponents in quick straight-set
victories, putting Michigan in
front, 2-1. King was the next Wol-
verine to finish beating Olivier
Borsos at No. 1 singles.
The Wolverines' top player
orchestrated a perfect first set,
ending most points with a winner.
Borsos even paid his complements
to King when he yelled "unbeliev-
able," after one of King's many
fantastic shots.
After stormingthrough the first
set, King motioned to the crowd to
get loud, and they responded with
no trouble. But King's animated
opponent wasn't having any of it,
and he jumped out to a 2-0 lead in
the second set.
"I completely lost focus," King
said. "I had a lot of fun out there,
which is a great thing, but can also
be kind of dangerous. Whether or
not you're playing No. 1 or No. 6,
if you lose your focus for a while,
you're going to get down."
But at 3-4, King broke the
Tiger's serve to knot the set at
four games. King served up a fast

game, cruising to a 5-4 lead and
then looking to the crowd again
for noise.
Borsos was simply out of gas by
that point. He had given the No. 6
player in the country everything
he had, including loud grunts
after every stroke, but it wasn't
enough. He dropped his next ser-
vice game to give King the game,
set and match.
"I found it funny (how ani-
mated he was)," Kingsaid. "That's
college tennis, and that's what
it should be. I knew that if I got
focused, I would be fine and play
my game."
After the conclusion of King's
match, Franks finished off Szacin-
ski for the dual win, but Bernstein
wasn't finished at No.2 singles. In
the third set, Bernstein came from
behind and sent the set to a tie-
breaker. After squandering four
match points, Bernstein finally
closed it out against Skupski for
his third win of the season.
"It's great for my confidence,"
Bernstein said. "Getting wins is
always great, but it's just about
improvement, and I do think I
showed some definite improve-
ment in some areas that I've been
working on, so that's always a
huge positive."
Bernstein's win made the Wol-
verines' dual victory look sweeter,
as they avenged last season's loss
to LSU by the same score, 5-2.
Michigan enjoyed its third victory
at home this season, but the team
will only play one match in Ann
Arbor in the next five weeks.

e Green. The Michigan State defense

smothered Michigan's offense all
game long, holding the Wolver-
ines to under 40-percentshooting
from the field and their second-
lowest scoring total of the season.
Ultimately, it was Green's day.
The Spartan captain could not be
stopped in the second half, and he
finished the game with a double-
double on 14 points and 16 boards,
matching Michigan's rebounding
total by himself. Any questions

about the health of his left knee,
which he sprained late in the sec-
ond half at Illinois on Tuesday,
were completely erased.
"I couldn't even tell he was
hurt," said freshman point guard
Trey Burke. "He hit some big
shots down there. He got to the
rim a lot, got to the line a lot. He
looked better than he usually
does."
"He has a huge desire," added

senior guard Stu Douglass. "A lot
of rebounding is just a lot of want.
You can tell he's hungry for the
boards, he's hungry to get extra
possessions on the offensive end
and get offensive boards. You
really just gotto match that inten-
sity."
The atmosphere inside the
Breslin Center at tip-off was elec-
tric, but neither offense was able
to feed off it early on. The first

bucket of the contest didn't come
for two-and-a-half minutes, a

No second-half heroics

'Hobey' Hunwick beaches
Miami in crucial series

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
EAST LANSING - Sunday
wasn't the first time sophomore
forward Tim Hardaway Jr. was
held scoreless in the opening
20 minutes of a game against
Michigan State.
So when he missed his only
two field goals and was limited
to one assist and no rebounds,
the Wolverines weren't overly
concerned about Hardaway's
ability to charge back with
a strong second-half perfor-
mance. After all, in a win over
the Spartans last season, Hard-

away led Michigan to a win by
scoring 20 second-half points
after being held scoreless in the
first half.
But this time, Hardaway
mustered just four points -two
of which came via meaning-
less free throws in the garbage
time. The guard shot just 1-of-
10 from the field, as the Wolver-
ines fell, 64-54.
Not even Hardaway could
explain why he was stifled all
day long.
"I can't even answer that
question," Hardaway said. "I
just give them all the credit
- they deserve it. They came

out with a good game plan and
executed."
Michigan State coach Tom
Izzo had answers, though.
Izzo lauded Hardaway's tal-
ent and athleticism. So, instead
of focusing on shutting down
Hardaway, the Spartans game-
planned to take away the
methods Michigan uses to get
Hardaway the ball.
That centered on containing
freshman Trey Burke, the key
to the Wolverines' victory in
Ann Arbor three weeks ago.
"What we did is we shut
down Burke's penetration,"

After the Michigan hockey team
scored three first-period goals on
Friday, Miami (Ohio) coach Enrico
Blasi pulled starting goaltender
Cody Reichard in favor of Connor
Knapp.
The two seniors look nothing
alike. Reichard is under six-feet
tall. Knapp stands at 6-foot-6.
So why, in the post-game press
conference, did Michigan junior

forward A.J. Treais incredulously
ask, "They changed goalies?"
Probably because it didn't mat-
ter who was in net for Miami dur-
ing the Wolverines' series sweep.
It only mattered who stood at the
opposite end of the ice - fifth-year
seniornetminder Shawn Hunwick.
Hunwick turned in another
near-perfect weekend, the latest in
a string of impressive performanc-
es. In the last three weekends, he's
cruised to two shutouts and twice
held opponents to one-goal games.

This weekend, the Yost Ice
Arena crowd showered Hunwick
with chants of "Hobey Baker,"
the annual award given to college
hockey's best player. He was noth-
ing short of a rock, as his coach
Red Berenson likes to say, risingto
the occasion as RedHawk skaters
intruded into his crease all week-
end long.
Miami knocked him down time
after time, but that didn't stop
Hunwick from making plays when

rivalry. Or you

ning layup.
Maybe it was
the lockdown defense in the
final 31.4 seconds. Maybe it was
seeing the Spartans walk off the
court with their heads bowed,
dejected.
But, more than likely, your
lasting memory isn't something
that happened on the court.
It's Denard Robinson and
Roy Roundtree bouncing up and
down in the front row of the
student section, donning maize
shirts and dancingto the Blues
Brothers. That was captivating.
It's OK to remember that.
Try to remember the guy
standing, singing, jumping next
to Denard. Not Roy - the guy on
the other side. He had a maize
No.1 jersey painted on his body.
At first, people thought it was
Lloyd Brady, then it wasn't.
It was Zac Boyd, a senior Engi-
neeringstudent. For one night,
his face was plastered across
Twitter and ESPN, as he was for-
tunate enough to have been Rob-
inson's bench buddy in a thriller
against Michigan State.
But that's not important. It's
his backstory that brought him

non Brown, Paul Davis, Drew
Nietzel. You remember the win-
ners.
I knew Michigan football,
though. Mike Hart, John
Navarre and Braylon Edwards
were a little more memorable
(and somewhat less criminal)
than Jeff Smoker, Charles Rog-
ers and T.J. Duckett.
That all has changed, obvious-
ly. You'd be a fool not to notice
that the tide has shifted.
Michigan State has toppled
Michigan four straight seasons
on the gridiron. The Wolverines
responded with three consecu-
tive victories on the hardcourt
for the first time since 1998 -
wins that were later vacated
after the Robert Traylor inves-
tigation.
The Spartans defended
home court valiantly yesterday,
downing Michigan 64-54 at the
Breslin Center. It was a little
ugly. Draymond Green tied the
entire Wolverine team with 16
rebounds.
It's OK. Really. Rivalries
swing back and forth, that's the
beauty of them.
As the clock wound down at
the Breslin Center yesterday, the
Izzone shot one last barb toward
the Michigan bench.
"Where is Shoelace?" the stu-
dent section chanted.
He wasn't there. Neither was
his bench buddy Zac. The night
belonged to Sparty, but that's
not the whole season. The fall
doesn't belong to Michigan any-
more, and the Spartans finally
have competition in the winter.

Zac graduated from Grand

back. He went to school with Al
Horford. He went to school with
Jon Horford. He went to school

Zac played Little League base-
ball with me. We were in French
Club together.
Still not important.
He's from Spartan country,
right smack dab in the heart of
it. If you've never ventured near
East Lansing, it's a Utopian place,
where traditions are passed
down from generation to genera-
tion.
It's the kind of place where
every teacher is a Michigan State

grad, where every grandpa doffs
his Spartan cap at you on the
sidewalk. It's the kind of place
where every child has a trade-
mark Michigan joke.
"You've got a stain on your
shirt!"
Huh?
"That big 'M.' I think you
spilled something on your shirt."
Sometimes it's a little less
cryptic.
"I like you, but I hate Michi-
gan."
Fair enough. It's a rivalry. It's
about taking a punch and react-
ing with a right of your own.
If author and professor John
U. Bacon has his facts straight,
the "Spartans" moniker came as

a response to Ann Arbor being
dubbed the Athens of the West.
Point. Counterpoint.
In the first decade of the mil-
lennium, the Michigan college
sports scene was pretty struc-
turally sound. Fall was football
season. Football season was for
Michigan. Winter was basket-
ball season. Basketball season
was for the Spartans. (We could
stretch back into the 1990s and
the trend holds, but then we'd be
trudgingthrough my infancy.)
No need to mess with success.
Michigan has gone to11 bowl
games - five BCS games - since
2000, but has only two NCAA
Tournament appearances.
Michigan State has seen

eight bowl games - zero BCS
- but hasn't missed the NCAA
Tournament since 1997 and has
reached five Final Fours since
2000.
Rivalry games were tight, for
the most part. (Raise your hand
if you're willing to forget the
Spartans' 114-63 win in 2000.)
But by the end of the season, the
sentiment remained: The state
was painted maize in the fall,
green in the winter. Football
school versus basketball school.
Neither knew success in the
other's realm.
I didn't know Michigan bas-
ketball until I stepped foot on
campus. I knew the Spartans.

Osika proves her mettle at Meyo

Greenlee, Washington shine

By MARYAM SQUILLACE
For the Daily
In a sea of hundreds of ath-
letes, a modest freshman from
Waterford, Mich. shined.
This past weekend, the No.
23 Michigan women's track and
field team attended the Notre
Dame Meyo Invitational.
At the event, Michigan wom-
en's track and field freshman
Shannon Osika proved that class
standing is really just a label.
Osika was one of the 14 Wol-
verines that had top-10 perfor-
mances this past weekend. She
placed first in the Meyo Mile
with the eighth-fastest time in
the country and a personal best
of 4:38.42. Osika also beat her
personal-best of 4:41.31, which
she set at the team's meet at
Nebraska on Jan. 28.
"It was her turn today, (Osika)
was the freshest competitor, and
we're hoping we'll get many good
performances out of her. I know
the other athletes will step up
as well," said Michigan coach
James Henry.
Henry was also referring to
teammates junior Jillian Smith,
who placed second, and junior
Rebecca Addison, who placed
12th.
Osika also led the distance
medley relay to place first,
running the 1,200-meter leg,

followed by senior Brittani Wil-
liams, Smith and Addison. This
was the team's first time com-
peting in the distance medley
relay this season, obtaining a
first-place finish with a time of
11:04:30.
Because of their score, the
team is already NCAA Division-
I qualified, having beaten the
qualifying time of 11:03.50. Their
time is the fourth fastest in the
nation, and the best time of any
Big Ten team so far.
"It felt really good, really great
for my confidence," Osika said. "It
makes me excited for the future,
for the future meets, and seeing
what I can do for my team."
The team also got good perfor-
mances out of sophomore Taylor
Pogue, sophomore Amber Smith
and redshirt sophomore Kiley
Tobel. Pogue placed third in the
mile run, Amber Smith placed
third in the 60-meter hurdles
and Tobel placed fourth in the
pole vault. The athletes had
the upcoming Big Tens on their
minds, and used this event to
prepare themselves for the event,
their most important of the sea-
son.
"I think I need to work on my
speed a little bit," Pogue said. "I
think my endurance was there,
and I have a good base, but I
need to work on my turnover at
the end of the race. And I think

I need to improve on my overall
race strategy."
Tobel has been hard at work
this season with assistant coach
Shean Conlon, perfecting her
pole vaulting in light of the
upcoming Big Tens. She tied in
fourth place at Notre Dame after
placing second at their meet at
Nebraska.
"There was a lot of good com-
petition, so it was good jump-
ing against some competitors in
the Big Ten," Tobel said. "But I
would liked to have jumped high-
er today but I still am working on
things and getting ready for Big
Tens a couple weeks from now."
The main thing on the girls'
minds is preparing for the Big
Tens on February 24th and
25th. The SPIRE Invitational is
another opportunity before the
Big Tens for the girls to get ready,
both with their performance and
their mentality.
"Just got to keep moving
ahead, and as I would call it stay
connected," Henry said. "And
by that I mean as the competi-
tion improves, we must improve.
As conditions change, we must
change with the conditions. This
was a big track, our first 300-
meter track - 300-plus meter
track - and we stepped up to the
conditions. As the competition
improves, it's important that we
must improve."

his jump of 16 feet, 11 inches was
another feat in a successful sea-

bittersweet, as he was unable to
reach his goal of 17 feet.
LaPlante noted that despite
Greenlee's inability to clear 17

"I think he'svery determined,"
LaPlante said. "I like his attitude

I think he knows he has to work

Greenlee is optimistic after
Saturday's performance though,
as he finds himself in prime posi-
tion for this month's Big Ten
Championships.
LaPlante knows that every
track meet is worthwhile though,
even when his stars aren't com-

"Any time you go to a meet

Michigan tops Spartans for 35th consecutive season

Michigan State
hasn't beaten
Michigan since 1977
By PETER BROWN
For the Daily
Entering Saturday afternoon's
dual meet, the Michigan men's
swimming team hadn't lost to
Michigan State since 1977.
That streak was kept alive,
as the Wolverines defeated the
Spartans 186-102 on senior night
at Canham Natatorium in Ann
Arbor.
No. 4 Michigan (9-0, 4-0 Big
Ten) dominated in its final dual
meet of the season, sweeping
Michigan State in all 16 events.
Starting with a 100-yard back-
stroke win by senior Jan Konar-
zewski with a time of 49.69

seconds and finishing with a
200-yard freestyle relay win by
Michigan's A relay team - con-
sisting of Konarzewski, junior
Miguel Ortiz, freshman Bruno
Ortiz, and senior Dan Madwed
(1:22.40) - the Wolverines treat-
ed the meet as an opportunity to
warm up for the Big Ten Cham-
pionships.
"Michigan State's not too
good," Madwed said. "But
they're always our last meet and
they're a good tune-up to prac-
tice the little things before we
head off to Big Tens."
Michigan coach Mike Bot-
tom echoed Madwed's senti-
ment, saying "we're just getting
ourselves ready for the Big Ten
Championships. That's going to
be a tough battle with Ohio, and
we'll see what comes of that. But
these guys are ready, and they'll
swim well."

Vanderkaay - the youngest of
four Vanderkaay brothers, who
have all left legacies at Michigan
- placed first in the 500-yard
freestyle, outlasting sophomore
Ryutaro Kamiya and Michigan
State's Pat Falconer with a time
of 4:36.93.
"It's something that my broth-
ers and I can share as we get
older," Vanderkaay said. "It's
something that I always like to
take pride in.
"That was my first dual-meet
win, so it was pretty exciting
bringing the best for last. I'm
going to miss this place a lot, and
I'm glad I was able to win in my
last meet."
Other notable performers
included sophomore Connor
Jaeger, who won the 400-yard
individual medley with a time

of 3:59.16; junior Roman Willets,
who won the 100-yard freestyle
with a time of 45.04; junior Con-
nor McCarroll, who won the 200
backstroke with atime of 1:50.60;
and sophomore Kyle Duckitt,
who won the 200 breaststroke
with a time of 2:04.00.
The Ortiz brothers also found
individual success on Saturday:
Bruno won the 200 individual
medley and Miguel won the 100
butterfly.
Michigan is looking to con-
tinue its success at the Ohio State
Invitational next week.
Bottom is confident in his
team's chemistry moving for-
ward to the Big Ten Champion-
ships in Iowa City, which begins
on Feb. 22.
"(Saturday's meet) got them
together as a team, and they had
a lot of fun, and that's half the
battle, right?" Bottom said.

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Michigan senior guard Carmen Reynolds and Michigan dropped a last-second decision to the Spartans.
3-pointers the difference in
Michigan's loss to Spartans

ByMICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
They got the shot they
wanted.
With 30 seconds left in the
Michigan women's basketball
game against Michigan State,
senior guard Courtney Boylan
had a chance to break a tie on
a wide-open look from behind
the arc. She missed, and the
Spartans took the 65-63 lead
with a game-winning jump
shot by senior Porsche Poole
with four seconds left.
"It didn't really feel very
good going off my hand, but it
was pretty close," Boylan said
about the missed 3-pointer.
"You have to take that shot."
Despite Boylan's missed
3-pointer, Michigan's effective
shooting performance from
deep kept the team inthe game
on Sunday. But every time the
Wolverines nailed a 3-pointer,
Michigan State responded
with a basket of its own.
The Spartans opened up the
game on an 01-0 run; starting
3-for-3 from behind the arc.
They cooled off as the game
progressed, but were led by a
surprising figure: sophomore
guard Kiarissa Bell, who has
averaged just 2.5 points per
game this season.

Bell finished the game
at 3-for-4 from deep, one of
which opened up the scoring
for Michigan State.
"We thought that if there
was a kid we could get off
stastically, it was (Bell)," said
Michigan coach Kevin Bors-
eth. "She made shots though."
Senior forward Carmen
Reynolds had one of her better
shooting performances of the
season, finishing 3-for-5 from
behind the arc, all of which
came in the first half. Strug-
gling of late to find her stroke,
Reynolds looked comfortable
in her shots.
Michigan finished 50 per-
cent from behind the arc - 20
percent higher than its season
average. There were moments
in the game where it looked
like the Wolverineswere going
away from the deep ball and
trying to get it inside to junior
forward Rachel Sheffer, but
Spartan senior center Lyken-
dra Johnson posed problems
for the post players all game.
Whether the looks were
wide-open or highly contest-
ed, Michigan used the 3-point-
er to its advantage.
"That's the thing about our
team, is that one half it may
be going inside and the next
half it may be going outside,"

Boylan said. "That's the nice
thing about our offense. You
don't have to rely on one thing,
necessarily."
The Wolverines shot fewer
3-pointers in the second half
since they were able to get
production from other places.
Boylan had 15 second-half
points, only three of which
came from behind the arc.
With 5:18 left in the sec-
ond half, Michigan had a five
point lead - its biggest of the
day - and the offense looked
to be in complete rhythm.
Then, Michigan State coach
Suzy Merchant came up with
a unique way to stop the Wol-
verines' hot shooting.
All season, one common
denominator of Michigan's
losses has been its struggles to
score.
This is one of the first losses
for the Wolverines where they
have performed well and come
up short. Their 50-percent clip
from behind the arc is the best
percentage they've had since
opening Big Ten play on Dec.
30.
Though Michigan lost, the
win should help its confidence,
especially that of the shooters,
who saw a lot of success on the
perimeter against the tough
Michigan State defense.

Meanwhile, Michigan State

Gymnasts excel in Las Vegas

Three members from the
No. 8 Michigan men's gym-
nastics team excelled in the
Winter Cup in Las Vegas this
weekend.
Sophomore Sam Mikulak
and freshmen Adrian de los
Angeles and Stacey Ervin all
earned appearances in the
finals after Thursday's com-

To make the finals, a
gymnast had to be a top-10

Thursday's competition. De
los Angeles was at the head
of the team, placing third on

ninth in the event. Mikulak
placed fourth on high bar,
fifth on parallel bars, and
sixth on rings.

What a difference a couple
months make.
The Michigan and Miami
(Ohio) hockey teams first played
each other in November, with the
RedHawks sweeping the Wolver-
ines in Oxford. In the first game
of that series, Miami came out
and hit Michigan in the mouth,
never looking back after scoring
a goal less than two minutes into
the game. That game, and that
series, started a month-long slide
for the Wolverines, where they
didn'twin agame until Dec. 3.
Fast forward to February.
The Wolverines, coming off
a bye week, took it to Miami the
entire weekend, and earned a
sweep of their own. They showed
off a physical style of play that
appeared two weeks ago at Notre
Dame but hadn't been a charac-
teristic for most of the season.
Michigan played like a team
that had something to prove,
punishing the RedHawks when-
ever they had the opportunity
and refused to back down from
one of the most talented teams in
the CCHA.
"This isn't women's tennis,
this is CCHA hockey," said junior
forward A.J. Treais. "We might
not be the biggest team in the
league, but we can hang with
those guys."
On Friday night, Michigan
scored three goals in the first
period. They weren't fancy or
finesse goals. These were, near-
the-crease punishing goals.
To set up the second goal of the
period, senior captain Luke Glen-
dening delivered a massive check
that sent Miami defenseman Ben
Paulides sprawling to the ice.
Treais was left with empty space
between him and goaltender
Cody Reichard, said "thank you
very much" to Glendening, and
finished top right on Reichard.
A pretty goal, yes, but not one
Michigan would have scored in
November.
"It's something that Red
always says - when you are
focusing more on defense, and
when you go out there working
as hard as you possibly can, the
bounces kind of go your way,"
said junior defenseman Lee Mof-
fig-
Surprising to no one that
has seen these teams play, Fri-
day's game had some extra-
curricular activities. Senior

goaltender Shawn Hunwick took
a couple minutes to get up after
being blasted in the crease, and
the referees had to break up play-
ers after almost every save.
But Friday night was just a
warm-up to the shenanigans that
plagued Saturday night's contest.
The game was a dogfightfromthe
beginning, and only got worse as
Michigan's lead got bigger.
The Wolverines had a dumb-
founding six penalties in the first
period, earning their first with
less than a minute off the clock.
The penalties didn't hurt Michi-
gan, though, as it ended the first
period up 1-0 after a shorthanded
goal by Moffie.
The series was physical, but
didn't get out of hand until the
third period of Saturday's con-
test. The two teams combined for
16 penalties, with most of those
coming after the game was out of
reach. With only one minute left,
a scrum broke out after a save
by Miami goalie Connor Knapp.
Freshman forward Alex Guptill
was the first Wolverine in the
brawl, but junior forward Chris
Brown finished off the job.
Miami defenseman Will
Weber and Brown - dropping
their gloves and taking swings
well after the whistle had blown
- would have torn each other to
pieces if not for the referees.
A total of nine penalties were
given out after the fight, putting
a sour ending on a hard-fought
game.
"I thought we played a good
game," Berenson said. "Disap-
pointing at the end. The score
was out of reach - that stuff
shouldn't happen. There's no
fighting in college hockey. Let's
face it, if you want to fight, go out
to the parking lot after the game."
Because of his disqualifica-
tion penalty, Brown will be sus-
pended for Friday's game against
Michigan State.
The Wolverines lose one of
their best offensive players in one
of their most important games
and Miami loses its captain
against non-conference oppo-
nent Alabama-Huntsville.
The series was a war that
Michigan battled through, dis-
pelling any notion that this team
isn't physical enough for the post-
season. Michigan didn't allow a
goal on Saturday, despite finish-
ing with 52 penalty minutes.

team that Miami saw in Novem-

M loses redemption
chance against MSU

Hunwick, penalty kill key sweep

ByMATT SPELICH
Daily Sports Writer
For the briefest moment, it
seemed that fortune was smil-
ing upon the Michigan women's
basketball
team. MSU 657
A hard- MICHIGAN 63
fought sec-
ond half against Michigan State
culminated in a tie, 63-63, with
less than 30 seconds left on the
clock. Then, in a most inexpli-
cable way, Courtney Boylan's
defender went head first into the
hardwood, leaving the senior
guard open to deliver a 3-point
dagger. But her shot clanged off
the back iron, and was picked up
by the Spartans.
Down at the other end, Spar-
tan guard Porshe Poole dropped
a 15-foot jumper, stopping the
clock at four seconds - just
enough time for a Hail Mary
attempt from junior guard
Jenny Ryan. But when the clock
ran out, the scoreboard read
65-63.
Even lady luck couldn't stop
the Spartans.
"We had a wide-open shot,"
said Michigan coach Kevin
Borseth, "If we made that shot,
it would have been on the other
hand, but we didn't make it. I
thought we played really well.
I don't think that there's much
else that we could have done.
"Sure, we can look back to a
specific turnover or a missed
shot early on. We can beat that
dead horse and ask ourselves,

'what if?' but at the end of the
day, (Michigan State is) a great
team and they played a great
game."
No matter how "great" of a
game the match-up was, it was
without a doubt a dramatic one.
The event played out like a soap
opera, only with more knock-
down, drag-out moments - the
kind reserved for the National
Hockey League.
In the first four minutes,
Michigan State went on a shoot-
ing spree with an 11-0 run.
Three minutes later, the Wol-
verines tied it up at 15.
After an unproductive first
half at Crisler, the Spartans' Lyk-
endra Johnson - last year's Big
Ten Defensive Player of the Year
- woke up in the second for an
aggressive back-and-forth with
junior center Rachel Sheffer.
Sheffer racked up 13 points and
three blocks for the Wolverines.
In spite of everything, the
Wolverines still found them-
selves up by five points with 5:30
left on the clock.
The last five minutes was a
dead heat between Michigan's
power pair, Boylan and Sheffer,
and Michigan State's, Johnson
and Poole. Then came the open
shot, and the rest was history.
"It didn't feel good going off
my hand," Boylan said. "But you
have to take that shot. When
you're wide open at the end of
the game, you don't know if
you'll get another chance. You
got to put it up. I just couldn't get
it to go in."

The defensive corps continued
to show up for Michigan's series
this weekend.
Sure, the back lines for the
Michigan hockey team are physi-
cally present
every game. But NOTEBOOK
in thisweekend's
series against Miami (Ohio), the
defensemen helped carry the Wol-
verines to decisive 4-1, 3-0 victo-
ries - and you could see that they
were engaged for the full 120 min-
utes. It started on Friday, when the
defense was able to weather a sec-
ond period that saw only one shot
from the Wolverines.
Michigan's offense was a little
more productive on Saturday. But
the defense still held stable, and
the Wolverines have their second
line to thank for that.
Since the return of sophomore
defenseman Jon Merrill, Michi-
gan's goals against per game aver-
age has decreased dramatically
from 2.60 to 1.25. That statistic is
certainly a confidence booster.
"With Jonny in the lineup, he
upgrades our defense a lot," said
Michigan coach Red Berenson.
"He gives us another puck-han-
dling defenseman. He's a big part
of it. (He) makes a difference."
It's the way Merrill reads the
ice that makes him such a valuable
player, according to sophomore
forward Luke Moffatt. Merrill
tallied two assists over the week-
end simply because he effectively
worked the puck from the point
before finding an open man.
"(Merrill) shoots it where he
wants it," Moffatt said. "The
power of the shot doesn't matter if

Fifth-year senior goalie Shawn Hunwick collected his fifth shutout of the season on Saturday against the Red Hawks.

you (can't) get it there."
But don't forget about Merrill's
partner-in-crime, junior defense-
man Lee Moffie. Moffie scored
two of the Wolverines' three goals
on Saturday, one of which came
shorthanded.
"We're not planning on our
defense scoring goals," Berenson
said. "All the goals the defense
scores are important goals. It's
good to get some offense from our
defense once in awhile."
HELPING HUNWICK: His fifth
shutout of the season was just
another game in the life of senior
goaltender Shawn Hunwick.
Hunwick stopped 29 shots en
route to Michigan's win. But his
biggest stop of night came on a
shot that could've been a serious
game changer.
His two defenders left him out
to dry - Merrill broke his stick at
an inopportune moment and Mof-

fie was nowhere to be found - as
a RedHawk took advantage of a
breakaway.
Hunwick made the stop with
his pads, but somehow, the puck
managed to squirt through and
rest on the goal line.
The Miami bench insisted it
crossed the line. The referees took
several minutes to review the play
before confirming the no-goal rul-
ing, which was made much to the
RedHawks' dismay. '
"If 6,000 people sigh, it's a
pretty good chance the home team
knows that it's a goal," said Miami
coach Enrico Blasi. "We gotta
accept that and move on."
Hunwick and the Wolverines
caught abreakwiththe ruling. But
the path to a shutout does not run
smoothly - literally.
"A big problem we've been
having all year is Shawn getting
bumped," Moffie said. "(Hun-

wick's) on his back."
Hunwick had several run-ins
with the RedHawks on Friday,
though his contact with them on
Saturday was limited to just one
knock down.
After being ejected from a game
against Northern Michigan earlier
this season, Hunwick has learned
his lesson about fighting back, let-
ting his defensemen get physical
for him instead. But Miami goal-
tender Connor Knapp wanted to
get right in on all the action.
Knapp left the net when, as the
third period was winding down, a
brawl broke out around him, and
he started shoving Moffie.
When asked if he ever consid-
ered leaving his net to go fight
the 6-foot-6 Knapp, Hunwick
laughed.
"He'd beat me up," Hunwick
said. "He'd kill ya. You know how
big he is? Have you seen Rocky 4?"
