The 
Sixth 
Circuit 
Court 

of Appeals struck down the 
University of Michigan’s sexual 
assault 
investigation 
model 

Friday, saying that universities 
“must give the accused student 
or his agent an opportunity to 
cross-examine the accuser.” The 
current U-M sexual misconduct 
policy does not require a hearing 
or 
cross-examination 
of 
the 

student making the accusation.

This decision is an appeal 

of U.S. District Judge David 
Lawson’s ruling in the 2017 court 
case Doe vs. Baum. In this case, 
Lawson dismissed a lawsuit filed 
by Deborah Gordan Law on behalf 
of a former University student 
who violated the University’s 
Student Sexual Misconduct Policy 

yet argued his due process was 
denied.

According to the court opinion, 

the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 

as a public university, failed to 
comply with the holding that 
accused students must have the 
opportunity to cross-examine 
their accuser when credibility is 
in question.

“Thirteen years ago, this court 

suggested that cross-examination 
may 
be 
required 
in 
school 

disciplinary proceedings where 
the case hinged on a question of 
credibility. Flaim v. Med. Coll. 
of Ohio, 418 F.3d 629, 641 (6th 
Cir. 2005),” the opinion read. 
“Just last year, we encountered 
the credibility contest that we 
contemplated 
in 
Flaim

On the first day of classes, about 106,000 devices connected to University Wi-fi

After a heavily anticipated 

upgrade, students will now be 
able to get connected at the 
heart of campus. University 
and 
Student 
Government 

leaders gathered at the steps of 

the Hatcher Graduate Library 
last Friday to cut the ribbon 
and officially completion of 
the Campus WiFi Upgrade. 
The project brings wireless 
internet access to the Diag and 
upgrades internet connection 
in more than 250 buildings on 
campus.

Ravi

“When I was your age, I was 

very conscious of myself as a 
Vietnamese American and Asian 
American, and I knew I was a 
refugee but I didn’t like go around 
calling myself that because I knew 
that there weren’t a lot of stories 
about any of these populations 
that I was a part of.”

Michigan in Color had the 

opportunity to sit down with the 
Pulitzer Prize winning author 
Viet Thanh Nguyen to discuss his 
work and his upcoming lecture at 
the Lydia Mendelssohn Theatre 
on Tuesday at 5:30 p.m about his 
Vietnamese heritage and history. 
The conversation turned toward 
the complexities of the Asian 
American and Asian identity as 
well as its place in the greater 

discussion about self-perception 
and belonging in the United 
States and the world.

Nguyen specifically identifies 

as a refugee, rather than an 
immigrant, acknowledging the 
label makes many uncomfortable 
because it challenges the standard 
expectation of arriving to the 
country to pursue the American 
Dream. His work is slowly 
expanding the notion of what it 
means to be Asian in the United 
States. Nguyen is the author of the 
New York Times bestseller “The 
Sympathizer” and is a prominent 
figurehead and scholar for Asian-
American studies. Currently, he is 
a professor of English, American 
Studies

University Wi-Fi network.

University 
President 

Mark Schlissel concluded 
the ceremony, speaking on 
the role Wi-Fi connection 
plays 
in 
student 
and 

faculty 
productivity 
and 

innovation.

“This project is actually 

long 
overdue,” 
Schlissel 

said. “And I’m very pleased 

that I got to play a role 
in helping bring it to 
fruition. More and more 
each day we depend on 
internet access as our 
tether and our lifeline 
at 
scales 
that 
range 

from around the Diag 
to literally around the 
world.”

Schlisse 
credited 

multiple 
generations 

of 
Central 
Student 

Government 
leaders 

for the completion of 
the project. The project 
was launched by former 
CSG President Anushka 
Sarkar, 
and 
current 

CSG President Daniel 
Greene, a Public Policy 
senior, who was present 
at the ceremony to see it 
through.

Greene acknowledged 

Sarkar’s dedication to 
the project and said the 
Wi-Fi improvement is an 
example of the ways the 
University is listening to 
the needs of its students.

“The completion 

of Wi-Fi on the Diag 

highlights the University’s 
commitment to meeting the 
evolving needs of students 
and 
demonstrates 
the 

productivity of successful 
relationships 
between 

student and administrative 
leaders,” Greene said.

LSA 
sophomore 
Evan 

Starr was working on a class 
assignment under a tree 
on the Diag following the 
ceremony.

“(The Wi-Fi’s) been good 

— better than last year’s,” 
Starr said. “It encourages 
you to be outside.”

Schlissel 
said 
many 

Wi-Fi access points have 
been concealed to preserve 
the 
aesthetics 
of 
the 

campus. Coupled with the 
increased internet speeds, 
the Diag will become even 
more active campus spot, 
Schlissel said.

“With Wi-Fi connectivity 

further 
enhancing 
the 

learning environment, there 
is no limit on lightning-
fast access to the world’s 
information 
no 
matter 

where you are on the U of M 
campus,” Schlissel said.

At the June Board of 
Regents meeting, the 
board, led by University 
President Mark Schlissel, 
voted to increase student 
tuition rates for the third 
year in a row. In-state 
tuition increased by 2.9 
percent and out-of-state 
rose by 3.9 percent. Since 
2002, tuition revenue has 
increased by more than 
135 percent. Compared 
to last year’s rates, tuition 
for Michigan residents 
went from $14,826 to 
$15,262 and out-of-state 
student tuition went from 
$47,452 to $49,326.

The Michigan One 
Fair Wage initiative 
would raise Michigan’s 
minimum wage to $12 
an hour by 2022 and 
include tipped workers 
by 2024. Currently, a 
“tip credit” allows
employers to pay 
workers who are 
tipped as low as $3.38 
an hour.

Compared to last 
year’s report, OIE 
saw a 27 percent 
increase of reported 
cases, rising from 
218 to 277.

By 2021, the contract 
minimum salary for 
University
lecturers will increase 
by $16,500 in Ann 
Arbor, $13,700 in Flint 
and $12,700 in
Dearborn. Equity
adjustments, or 
one-time additions to 
base pay, would also 
increase by $3,000 to 
$12,500. Equity will
differ for lecturers 
earning more than 
$80,000 annually.

While 2017’s
Hispanic/Latino 
student population sat 
near 6 percent, data 
from the Office of
Budget and Planning 
for 2017 shows the 
percentage of His-
panic/Latino regular 
instructional faculty — 
which includes tenure-
track faculty,
non-tenure-track 
faculty and lecturers — 
was 3.97 percent.

University of Michigan 
Regent Ron Weiser, 
R, and his wife Eileen 
Weiser donated $10 
million Wednesday to es-
tablish the Weiser Diplo-
macy Center at the Ford 
School of Public Policy. 
Weiser, chair of the state 
Republican party, began 
working on the idea of 
the center with Public 
Policy Dean Michael Barr 
last spring with the goal 
of generating interest 
in diplomacy among 
students and providing 
them with career services 
in the field.

Head Football Coach Jim 

Harbaugh named Brenda 
Tracy, 
a 
sexual 
assault 

survivor and activist, as 
the University of Michigan 
football team’s honorary 
captain this Saturday.

Tracy 
was 
sexually 

assaulted by four Oregon 
State University football 
players 
in 
1998. 
She 

publicly 
came 
forward 

with her story in 2014, and 
has worked with athletic 
programs 
around 
the 

country with her campaign 
#SetTheExpectation 
in 

1998.

#SetTheExpectation 
is 

dedicated to educating high 
school and college athletes 
and coaches about sexual 

violence and working to 
make them to be part of the 
solution.

In August, Tracy visited 

the 
Michigan 
football 

team to share her story. 
Shortly 
after, 
Harbaugh 

invited her to serve as the 
team’s 
honorary 
captain 

for 
the 
opening 
game 

against Western Michigan 
University.

“At the time the media 

was overrun with multiple 
news 
stories 
of 
sexual 

abuse 
and 
domestic 

violence coming out of Ohio 
State and as an advocate, 
I was feeling somewhat 
defeated, but after sharing 
my story and my pain, I 
left the team room that day 

feeling 
encouraged 
and 

inspired,” Tracy states on 
her GoFundMe page.

 In a press conference 

following 
the 
game, 

Harbaugh 
expressed 
his 

and his team’s appreciation 
for Tracy’s advocacy.

“We all learned so much 

from Brenda,” Harbaugh 
said in the press conference. 
“I did personally and I 
know all our guys did. 
She’s amazing. Her story 
is 
amazing; 
her 
work 

is 
amazing; 
what 
she’s 

accomplishing is amazing. 
The guys really appreciate 
her. Not just the level of 
adversity, but what she’s 
done with her life and how 
she’s impacting anybody 

that will listen.”

On 
Sept. 
4, 
Tracy 

announced 
via 
Twitter 

she started a GoFundMe 
campaign 
with 
a 
goal 

of 
$25,000 
for 
the 

SafeHouse 
Center. 
The 

SafeHouse Center is a 
non-profit 
organization 

located 
in 
Ann 
Arbor 

that 
provides 
support 

for 
domestic 
violence 

and 
sexual 
assault 

survivors of Washtenaw 
County. 
Their 
services 

include 
emergency 

shelter, 
counseling, 

support groups, and legal 
advocacy.

-JULIA FORD

ON THE DAILY: BRENDA TRACY SERVES AS HONORARY CAPTAIN


Dearborn 
is 
my 
safe 

haven, a city with the highest 
concentration of Arabs in all of 
America, a place for people who 
are just like me. Growing up, 
I had the best of both worlds. 
I was able to connect with 
my Middle Eastern roots and 
culture in a city that has the best 
Mediterranean food around. I 
could speak Arabic and not feel 
out of place. My days would be 
filled with visiting “khaltos” 
(Arabic word for aunts) and 
potlucks where we would eat 
our days away while playing tag 
outside with the neighborhood 
kids who were more like family 
than friends.

However, my city was never 

meant to be this vibrant, lively 
and diverse. Henry Ford built my 
town with the intention that it 
would be a slum for his workers 
of color and their families, but 
that backfired because he’s given 
me a home unlike any other. As a 
Muslim, I grew up with mosques 
and 
religion 
surrounding 

me. During Ramadan (holy 
month of fasting), our bakeries, 
restaurants 
and 
stores 
stay 

open until 5 a.m., but are closed 
during the day because everyone 
refrains from eating. Ramadan 

is my happiest month because 
it’s when our nightlife shines 
through; kids play in the streets 
until three in the morning, 
families come over and stay until 
“suhoor” (sunrise, when fasting 
resumes for the day), friends go 
out to hookah lounges and our 
mosques are the fullest they get 
every year for taraweeh prayer 
(special Ramadan prayers). I 
never grew up with a Christmas, 
but I believe Ramadan more 
than made up for it.

Despite all of the wonderful 

things about Dearborn, I spent 
my whole life fighting to get 
out of its bubble. I hated the 
relentless gossip and people set 
in their old ways from the old 
country. I wanted to see more 
than my picturesque town and 
I grew up with such big dreams 
fighting 
against 
the 
status 

quo. And despite all of this, 
now that I am in Ann Arbor, I 
yearn for my town. I become 
retrospective and think back to 
the now defunct Arab-American 
festival on Warren Street, my 
old neighborhood growing up 
and of my wonderful parents 
who instilled in me the values 
of family, culture, tradition and 
community. Even though I live 
only an hour away, I feel like 
everything I have ever known 
has been ripped away from me.

Back home, I would spend 

my days eating grape leaves, 
falafel, 
tabbouleh, 
fattoush, 

etc. Needless to say, during my 
first week at the University 
of 
Michigan, 
my 
pampered 

taste buds found the dining 
hall food bland, unappetizing 
and incredibly foreign. I saw 
students carrying plates filled 
to the brim with food I had 
never before seen in my life and 
downing it all like it was nothing. 
Meanwhile, I needed extra salt, 
unattainable lemon slices and 
unheard-of spices to season 
my food, all of which seemed 
wholly unavailable in the South 
Quad Dining Hall. My biggest 
realization since setting foot on 
campus is that I may have grown 
up in America, but my taste buds 
are 100 percent Middle Eastern. 
I don’t think I had a decent meal 
besides pizza for days. This self-
inflicted “starvation” forced me 
to throw away my pride, call 
my mom and beg her to make 
me food I could genuinely eat, 
telling her I would board a bus 
back home to Dearborn for the 
day if she did. Now, as I sit in my 
dorm room, my supply of Arab 
food is dwindling and I am once 
again venturing out into the 
dining hall hoping for the best. 
They say you never appreciate 
something until it’s gone and it 
has never rung truer because 
now, I want my home back.

The definitive ranking of “Bring It On”

Hands down, the “Bring It On” 

movie franchise is one of the best 
series of all time. If you don’t agree 
with this then you probably just 
need to sit down and watch them 
all again to reeducate yourself on 
cinematic greatness. Time and 
again, the “Bring It On” movies 
have been ranked, but never 
have they been ranked by their 
representation of people of color, 
only the quality of the film. With 
the removal of the “Bring It On” 
franchise from Netflix, I decided 
the time had come to undertake 
the task of ranking them by this 
specific criterion.

* “Bring it On: The Musical” 

will not be included in this ranking 
as this is solely a ranking of the 
“Bring It On” films. “Bring It On: 
Worldwide #Cheersmack” will 
also not be included in the ranking 
simply because the movie sucks 
and is an embarrassment to the 
“Bring It On” franchise.*

5. “Bring it On: Again.”
This placement should come as 

no big surprise as the first “Bring 
It On” sequel was one of the least 
successful movies in the franchise 
and the least talked about by fans. 
This lack of notoriety within the 
fandom is most likely due to its stark 
lack of representation of people of 
color. The only named character 
of color is the main character’s 
(Whittier) 
Black 
best 
friend 

Monica. This does not say much 
about the writer’s inclusiveness 
due to the rampant popularity of 
the “Black best friend” trope seen 
in pretty much every ’90s to ’00s 
teen movies. (i.e., “10 Things I Hate 
About You”, “Clueless”, “She’s All 
That”, etc.) Not only was Monica 
the lone person of color in the 
film, but her role was completely 
relegated to fulfilling negative 
stereotypes of a Black woman: 
loud, sassy, rude, always talking 
back and ready to give someone a 
piece of her mind.

Overall, the movie had an 

extreme lack of representation 
of people of color, and the one 
character 
that 
made 
up 
its 

representation completely fulfilled 
a stereotype.

4. “Bring It On: In It to Win It”
Just like “Bring It On: Again”, 

the only main person of color is 
the Black best friend. Though the 
main character’s love interest is 
extremely ethnically ambiguous, 

he also could just be white with a 
heavy tan. So, we’ll keep the tally 
of actors of color at one and a half. 
(After research, I discovered that 
the actor is actually half-Filipino, 
but his race is never mentioned nor 
in question throughout the whole 
movie, so he will remain ethnically 
ambiguous.)

But back to the Black best friend.
Just as in “Bring It On: Again”, 

the character is a stereotype of a 
Black woman complete with slang, 
a fiery attitude and an eagerness to 
start fights. But even worse than 
the character Monica in “Bring 
It On: Again”, this movie’s Black 
character, Aeysha, is even more 
shockingly over the top with her 
one-liners and phrases that try to 
solidify how “Black” she is. Such 
phrases include “You know a cheer 
Crip can’t be hitting it with a cheer 
Blood.” She actually compared 
two of the biggest and most violent 
gangs in American history to 
opposing cheerleading teams and it 
was played for laughs.

However, “In It To Win It” 

narrowly tops “Bring It On: Again” 
because, despite lines like the 
aforementioned, there are some 
redeeming moments in the movie 
involving Ayesha’s subplot. One 
of these moments comes when 
she’s going completely over the top 
trying to prove her “Blackness” by 
twerking in a cheerleading routine 
and continuing to talk in her 
caricature Black fashion. A Black 
female cheer coach pulls her aside 
and asks her why she’s making 
a fool of herself pretending to be 
this stereotype. It showed at least a 
glimmer of self-awareness.

The second redeeming moment 

is when Aeysha admits to putting 
on this “super Black” character the 
whole time to gain respect because 
she used to be teased for being 
an “oreo” in junior high (Oreo is 
the taunting nickname given to 
Black kids who are perceived as 
being “white on the inside, yet 
‘Black’ on the outside”). While the 
movie attempted to reinforce this 
good message, it didn’t go deep 
enough or really followed through, 
especially when the movie ended 
that “touching note” with a white 
character telling Aeysha, “ooh, 
you’re whiter than me.” Aeysha 
agrees and says she’s proud of that 
fact.

3. “Bring It On: Fight to the 

Finish”

“Bring It On: Fight to the Finish” 

is significantly better than the first 
two, simply because it is one of the 

only “Bring it On” movies to have a 
main character of color, a working-
class Latina named Lina. Rather 
than giving the exaggerated image 
of what it is like to be a person of 
color from a white perspective 
like the other movies, “Fight to 
the Finish” gives a person of color 
a chance to helm the story. This 
movie does a great job stripping 
the norms of the “Bring It On” 
franchise by making the upper-
class white cheerleaders the evil 
antagonists. It also includes a love 
storyline including an interracial 
romance of Lina and the popular 
white basketball player in her new, 
predominately white school. In 
the end, the movie does a good job 
showing people can work across 
class and racial differences to 
succeed and work together for a 
common goal.

The only problem I have with 

this movie in particular is even 
though Lina is Latina and is of 
Latinx heritage, that’s never really 
celebrated. She speaks Spanish 
with her family but that’s about it. 
Everyone in her old neighborhood 
from East Los Angeles is either 
Black or Latinx, but neither of 
their cultures or heritages are 
celebrated. All of them are just 
grouped together by the social 
identity of being lower class or 
“poor,” and that’s how they’re 
referred to for the whole movie. 
Being a person of color in the movie 
is just equated to being poor and 
their individual identities as people 
of color are just erased. Also to top 
it all off, the movie still has the 
cringey stereotypical role of the 
Black best friend.

2. “Bring It On: All or Nothing.”
Two 
words, 
Solange 
and 

Knowles. And one more word, 
Rihanna. Okay, but star-studded 
cast aside, “Bring It On: All or 
Nothing” does a great job with 
its people of color representation. 
The storyline is flipped from the 
storyline of “Bring It On: Fight to 
the Finish”. A privileged white 
girl, Britney, moves to Crenshaw 
Heights, an inner city close to Los 
Angeles. At Crenshaw Heights, 
Britney learns to check her white 
privilege and that (gasp) people of 
color aren’t that different from her. 
This movie has some of the best 
representation of people of color 
in the franchise as multiple main 
characters are Black or Latinx.

Yearning for the comfort of home

The need for more POC rom coms

When I first watched Netflix’s 

original film “To All the Boys 
I’ve Loved Before”, my mom was 
there, and we hesitantly clicked 
on the trending movie. Obviously 
no longer in our teenage years, 
we were sure our enthusiasm 
wasn’t going to match the hype. 
However, 
minutes 
into 
the 

movie, our living room rang with 
boasting laughter and dramatic 
gasps, an easygoing warmth 
emerging as we relaxed more and 
more into the lighthearted story 
of Lara Jean Covey and Peter 
Kavinsky.

When I watched it for a second 

time, my aunt was there, and 
we sipped beautiful magenta 
Youthberry white tea together. 
With every sugary sip, I lost 
myself a little bit more in the 
sweetness of Covey’s whimsical, 
bubblegum 
pop 
romance. 
I 

soaked up the predictable, but 
charming love story, secretly 
wishing for my own Kavinsky.

When I watched it for the third 

time no one else was there, and 
I laid cuddled up in my blanket, 
my eyes watching the screen but 
my thoughts caught in tangles. 
I began to wonder why I found 
myself 
watching 
this 
movie 

repeatedly when hundreds of 
other selections were only clicks 
away. Dejectedly, I realized it 
wasn’t the trope-filled storyline 
that kept me coming back. It 
wasn’t even the cute boy. It 
was the starry-eyed simplistic 
depiction of romance with people 
of color, one that isn’t afforded to 
people who look like me.

When I chose not to watch it 

for the fourth time, I thought to 
myself, “When will Black women 
have their Lara Jean Covey and 
Peter Kavinsky?”

“To All the Boys I’ve Loved 

Before” 
is 
Netflix’s 
newest 

romantic comedy that is breaking 
the internet for not only its playful 
plot, but for its wonderful Asian 
representation in a carefree, 
lighthearted film. Coming out 
only two days after the critically-
acclaimed “Crazy Rich Asians”, 
the film tells the story of 16-year-
old Lara Jean Covey, a mixed-
race Korean-American girl, and 
her not-so-pretend relationship 
with high school heartthrob 
Peter Kavinsky.

This movie was the non-

cultural exposé for which I 
didn’t know I was yearning. It is 
incorrect and dismissive to call 
the film post-racial; however, “To 
All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” 
is revolutionary because, as a 
romantic comedy, it portrays 
the race of its main character 
without centering its entirety in 
combating negative stereotypes 
and racial hardship.

Too 
often, 
movies 
with 

predominantly 
Black 
casts, 

or movies that feature Black 
characters 
in 
general, 
focus 

only on Black stories that have 
an element of trauma. We know 
them as our slavery-themed, civil 
rights era, Tyler Perry’s Christian 
guilt storylines. We also, however, 
know them as our indie Oscar-
nominated films that have begun 
to dominate the box office.

Regretfully, 
I 
struggle 
to 

name critically- acclaimed Black 
movies without racial trauma at 
its core. Films like “Moonlight”, 
“BlacKkKlansman”, 
“Sorry 
to 

Bother You”, and “Dear White 
People” need to be produced, and 
they feature amazing storylines 
that deserve recognition. But I 
can only wish the Black movie 
experience can become more 
diversified to showcase movies 
with race-based trauma can exist 
at the same time and in the spaces 

as movies that choose not to.

In the same token, if “Get 

Out” can exist to make Black 
interracial relationships a plot 
point for horror and thriller, 
movies that show lighthearted, 
romantic, bubblegum pop Black 
interracial relationships should 
and can exist, as well.

It is unfair for the success 

of Black film to ride on the 
exploitation of trauma. It is 
also unfair for Black folks to 
be voided of cinema that lets 
Black experiences flourish. It’s 
why action movies like “Black 
Panther” 
and 
comedies 
like 

“Girls Trip” are revolutionary; 
it’s because they show Black 
characters in dynamic roles that 
are usually reserved for white 
characters.

The movement for lighthearted 

Black 
representation 
extends 

beyond the realm of film. We’ve 
seen it in photographer Myles 
Loftin’s 
multimedia 
project 

HOODED, a project to humanize 
Black men dressed in hoodies; 
social media movements such as 
#BlackBoyJoy, #BlackMenSmile 
and 
#CarefreeBlackGirl; 

Quil 
Lemons’ 
photo 
series 

“Glitterboy”; and numerous other 
projects focused on presenting 
alternative 
depictions 
of 

Blackness.

People of color are craving 

representation that exceeds the 
limited scope of narratives that 
have historically been portrayed 
in film. As a hopeless romantic 
and a lover of love, I am craving 
a predictable, trope-filled, cringy 
romantic comedy with a Black girl 
unapologetically loving and being 
loved. It is time that we see Black 
representation that flourishes just 
as much as it does in quality as it 
does in innocence and sweetness. 
Maybe one day, Black women, 
too, will have their Lara Jean 
Covey and Peter Kavinsky.

“M

y hair was long 
then. Long like 
the 
sighs 
of 
Loving Trees soaking in the still air 
before rain. I could hear their voices 
with the anticipation of thunder.”
Hello and welcome to my first 
novel! Well, the first line of my first 
novel. Actually, the first line of the first 
novel I tried to write. I was 14 when I 
scribbled this line into a notebook 
margin, and it eventually ended 
up in the notes section on my 
phone - a place where prose goes 
to die.
I titled this prose graveyard 
“Shower Thoughts,” though few 
of the lines collected there actually 
came to me in the shower. They fall, 
seemingly from nowhere, into my 
head. They dribble down into my 
hand where I can either write them 
down or feebly clutch them for a 
moment before they disintegrate 
back into vapor, waiting to condense 
once again into someone else’s brain. 
I rarely used these lines in any actual 
writing. I just wrote them down so no 
one else could have them.
I have kept “Shower Thoughts” 
since middle school. A kind of diary, it 
chronicles my thoughts and feelings 
throughout my teens. As I scroll back 
through, I am reminded of moments 
both momentous and insignificant. 
I can see through the emotional 
kaleidoscope of my 15-year-old eyes 
as I waited for something important 
to happen to me, like all the young 
adult novels said it would. It captures 
in amber my perspective at one 
particular moment in my life.
As a junior, I find myself sitting 
anxiously at one of life’s many 
thresholds. With childhood behind 
and adulthood ahead, I lie in wait, 
in between. I feel achingly far away 
from this young person who wrote 
and imagined all the time. I am not 
pursuing the dreams she had for 
me: I am not majoring in English, I 
am not yet a published author, and I 
won’t be studying abroad in the U.K. 
(where I won’t be falling in love with 
a beautiful Scotsman who wears 
cable knit sweaters and is in touch 
with his feelings). Despite all of this, 
I want to make sure I am somehow 
still me.

This column will be about 
that shifting of self and how one 
can reconcile who they were at an 
unformed 15 with who they are at 21, 
fighting for a place at the adults’ table. 
I will be rifling through my prose 
graveyard and exhuming bodies, 
breathing life back into the moments 
that birthed them and asking how 
they feel about where I am now with 
my life.

The line that opened this column 
was meant to be the first line of my 
first novel. I was fixated on the idea 
of being a child but writing for adults, 
amazing everyone with a beyond-
my-years maturity and complexity of 
thought. Once it became a bestseller, 
Anne Hathaway and Leonardo 
DiCaprio would star in the film 
adaptation. I had the whole thing 
sketched out in my head, but getting 
it onto paper proved more difficult. 
Not that I tried very hard. I was fairly 
certain that, when I decided to write 
it, the whole book would just pour 
out, standing there shocked and 
gawking like Adam moments after 
his creation. I trusted my future self 
to make this dream come true for the 
both of us.
Freshman year, I did so to a 
certain extent. I wrote a book, 250 
pages in six weeks. I took a class on 
children’s literature and our final 
project was to write and illustrate a 
children’s storybook. I decided this 
was my chance to fulfill my dream, 
so I swapped the storybook for a 
children’s novel. There would be 
no bowing to laziness or boredom 
if I had the threat of an academic 
deadline on my horizon. So, I wrote 

a plan. I wrote character descriptions 
and plot outlines, and did extensive 
research. When I set to actually 
writing, the pace was grueling. It was 
regimented and difficult, and some 
days the words just refused to come. 
To top it off, I was 19 and writing for 
11 and 12 year olds, something I would 
have considered an unthinkable 
embarrassment at 14.
Writing a book, it turns out, 
is really hard (Who knew?). My 
romantic delusions obscured the 
inconvenient reality that inevitably 
manages to seep in once we get to a 
certain age. The line with which I 
opened this column always evokes 
in me an all-consuming idealism. I 
can once again feel how it felt to have 
those words fall from the sky and into 
my churning mind. I can practically 
feel the weight of the imagined novel 
in my hands, knowing I would one 
day make this dream come true.
The reality was far worse and 
far better than how I had pictured it, 
both in the accomplishment and in its 
promise for the future. I accomplished 
something I had dreamt about since 
I was eight years old, proving that 
I am unstoppable if I choose to be. 
However, the experience also begged 
me to question in what other ways 
I am romanticizing my ideas of the 
future. I imagine going to law school 
and eventually becoming a living 
version of a character from “The 
West Wing.”
In theory, I know that path won’t 
be easy. I’m sure I will look back 
at my college years and chuckle at 
the idealism of my undergraduate 
kaleidoscope. Choosing to major in 
public policy instead of English is 
not the first time my ambitions will 
change. However, I hope I always 
manage to find things to look forward 
to in the most abstract of ways. And 
as I go, I will work to reconcile these 
different parts of myself—my past, 
present and future—and keep them 
all in balance. Make sure they learn 
from one another. And, eventually, get 
Anne and Leo to star in an adaptation 
of the book I trust my future self to 
write one day.

Let’s talk about women’s health
I

f you walk into almost any 
hospital or major health center 
in the United States, there will 
be some sort of Women’s Health 
Center on the directory. In some 
ways, these can be really good things. 
They allow women to access focused 
specialists in one convenient location, 
which is especially important since 
women often encounter doctors who 
doubt their pain or do not take their 
symptoms seriously. These kinds of 
areas can also be a refuge of privacy 
and healing for many women who are 
experiencing extremely traumatic 
medical problems or diagnoses.
However, setting aside a different 
part of the hospital specifically for 
women acts as a metaphor for the 
culture in which medical issues 
primarily faced by women are dealt 
with over there. They are dealt with 
in places that are not as visible or 
frankly, accessible, to everyone. When 
they are out of sight, and therefore out 
of mind, these illnesses, diseases and 
maladies are not acknowledged or 
grappled with as much as they should 
be in proportion to how many people 
they affect.
This past summer, I learned the 
implications of this dismissive culture 
the hard way. At the end of June, I was 
on a flight home from New York City 
when I began to have excruciating 
pain. While exiting the airplane, I 
collapsed in pain, and an ambulance 
eventually rushed me off the tarmac 
to the nearest hospital. After several 
uncomfortable 
ultrasounds, 
I 
was alerted that I needed to have 
emergency 
laparoscopic 
surgery 
around 2:00 AM. Once the anesthesia 
wore off later that day, my surgeon 
informed me they had diagnosed 
me with a chronic illness called 
stage IV endometriosis, as well as 
adenomyosis. If you’re like me or 
almost everyone else, you probably 
have no idea what endometriosis is, if 
you’ve even heard of it at all.
Endometriosis is a chronic illness 
in which endometrium, the tissue 
that lines the inside of the uterus, 
sheds but does not exit a woman’s 
body during menstruation. Inside 
of her body, it can grow outside of 
her uterus and spread to organs 
and nerves around the pelvic area 
(though endometrial tissue has been 
found as far away as the lungs). As a 
result, the woman may experience 
incapacitating pain so physically 

and emotionally insufferable that it 
dominates and controls almost every 
corner of her life: career, social life, 
sleep, relationships, sexual activity, 
diet and hobbies.
Though endo is incurable, it 
is highly treatable. The problem 
is that it is so rarely treated in a 
timely manner because it is so often 
ignored or misdiagnosed by doctors 
who lack the education about 
women’s health and endometriosis 
specifically. 
Because 
of 
endo’s 
variety of symptoms, women may be 
diagnosed with common maladies 
such as appendicitis, irritable bowel 
syndrome, 
sciatic 
nerve 
pain, 
ruptured ovarian cysts, depression, 
functional 
pain 
syndrome, 
etc. 
According to the Endometriosis 
Foundation of America, one in 10 
women and girls suffer from endo; 
however, the average woman is 27 
years old before she is diagnosed. 
I suffered through this disease 
untreated for seven years. And I 
was one of the lucky ones who was 
diagnosed earlier than most women.
And while I was lucky to be 
diagnosed earlier than many, I 
could have been diagnosed earlier. 
When I was 13, I was rushed to the 
hospital after collapsing in pain at 
home. Barely conscious, I endured 
several ultrasounds and eventually, 
an appendectomy (removal of my 
appendix). Out of curiosity, my mom 
recently requested and reviewed 
my records from that surgery. 
The notes and images indicate 
signs of endometriosis that were 
not heeded. Though it is almost 
impossible now to know if I truly 
had appendicitis or the doctors 
misdiagnosed my endometriosis, 
I know my body and I remember 
that pain. It was the same pain I 
have experienced for seven years, 
including the time I collapsed 
after exiting an airplane and had 
the emergency surgery that finally 
discovered my endometriosis.
I am not a person who wishes 
to share personal information, 
especially 
sensitive 
medical 
information, with people I do not 
know and trust deeply. But maybe if 
I had heard about this illness before, 
I could have brought my suspicions 
to my doctor. I might have been 
diagnosed earlier, and I might have 
been able to receive treatment and 
limited the amount of suffering and 

extreme pain I experienced as a 
result of endo.
There 
are 
probably 
many 
reasons why I had never heard 
of this illness before, but I think 
that the disregard for and stigma 
surrounding issues primarily faced 
by women is chief among them. 
When we advise young girls to hide 
their sanitary pads and tampons in 
a bag or pouch in public or make 
noises and faces indicating feelings 
of being grossed out at the mention 
of her period, we are cultivating a 
culture of shame around her natural 
biological functions. When we tell 
women and girls that intense pain 
during their period is normal, we 
are reinforcing false narratives and 
information about women’s health 
and wellness. And when we chastise 
them for being overdramatic about 
their pain or any symptoms they are 
experiencing, we are delaying their 
access to an accurate diagnosis and 
effective treatment.
I am not making the case to 
eliminate designated areas of 
health centers dedicated to serving 
women’s medical needs. In fact, 
I think they should probably be 
expanded and given more funding 
and resources so that more women 
and children are able to have access 
to all of the wonderful services 
they provide.
I simply believe we—you and 
me— all need to start having more 
conversations about issues women 
deal with, especially those that are 
health-related. We need more men 
to lean in, instead of detach and stop 
listening, to conversations about 
women and their health. As women, 
we also need to be more open and 
louder about our health and how it 
affects not only us but also how we 
are able to interact with the world 
and how the world can and should 
be interacting with us.
I hope that by sharing my story 
and subsequent health journey, 
I am able to bring some light to 
a vast world filled with matters 
women have been dealing with 
in private that is desperate for 
some illumination. I invite and 
encourage you to share your health 
process, too. Share with your 
family. Share with your friends. 
Share with the world.

Reconciliation of a triad

Trump’s South Africa sophism

ELIAS KHOURY | COLUMN

T

he 
Donald 
Trump 
administration is a circus. 
Naturally, amid all the 
chaos, many important stories get 
buried. I would like to turn your 
attention to a statement Trump 
made Aug. 22 via his favorite 
medium — Twitter.
“I have asked Secretary of 
State 
@SecPompeo 
to 
closely 
study the South Africa land farm 
seizures and expropriations and 
the large scale killing of farmers. 
‘South African Government is now 
seizing land from white farmers.’ @
TuckerCarlson @FoxNews”
This 
half-baked 
tweet 
is 
problematic for a variety of 
reasons. Firstly, as is so often 
the case with Trump, the claim 
is dubious at best. To be fair, 
the first part of the statement 
is 
not 
explicitly 
false, 
just 
misleading. 
Though 
a 
policy 
of land expropriation is being 
carried out by the South African 
government, to simply point 
that out and treat it as a problem 
without 
providing 
necessary 
context is dishonest in practice.
The discriminatory policies of 
South Africa’s former apartheid 
government created huge levels of 
societal inequality between white 
and Black people. The legacy of 
this morally reprehensible regime 
still haunts the country to this day. 
One of the many racist policies 
enacted under apartheid was the 
uncompensated theft of Black-
owned land and the confinement 
of the Black majority to only 7 
percent of the nation’s arable land.
The current land expropriation 
policy is an attempt at redressing 
apartheid era grievances. A 
returning of stolen goods, if you 
will. And the government is well 
within their legal right to do this: 
South Africa’s constitution allows 
for such action on the grounds 
of trying to right the wrongs of 
the past.
There is also a justification 
for doing this on the grounds 
of enhancing national welfare. 
Too much land in too few 
hands naturally creates market 
inefficiencies. In the words of 
former South African President 
Nelson 
Mandela: 
“(Land 
expropriation) fosters national 
reconciliation and stability. It 
underpins economic growth and 
improves household welfare and 
food security.”
The expropriation vision laid 
out by current South African 
President Cyril Ramaphosa is 
an extremely moderate one. His 
government has made a concerted 

effort to target unused land and 
abandoned buildings first and 
foremost to inconvenience as 
few people as possible. What 
Ramaphosa 
and 
the 
African 
National Congress are doing is a 
logical step forward for the South 
African nation and ought to be 
treated as such.
As for Trump’s second claim, 
there is no well-documented 
“large scale killing of farmers” 
taking place in South Africa right 
now. National police records 
show the financial year of 2017-
18 saw the lowest number of farm 
murders since 1991.
Factual inaccuracies aside, 
the casual observer may be left 
a bit confused by Trump’s tweet 
concerning South Africa. What 
do they have to do with us? The 
whole thing seems out of left 
field. South Africa—and all of 
Africa, for that matter—is all 
but nonexistent in everyday 

American political discourse.
However, the alleged plight of 
white South African farmers has 
become a hot-button issue with 
a rather unsavory crowd. The 
“alt-right” has, unsurprisingly, 
embraced the false narrative 
of white oppression and Black 
brutality 
wholesale. 
The 
promotion of this conspiracy 
theory seems to be a concerted 
effort by the movement to raise 
the racial consciousness of whites 
and incite a fear of Black people. 
Simply put, it’s a propaganda 
campaign meant to draw people to 
their cause of hatred and racism.
Naturally, the big names on 
the “alt-right” have been at the 
forefront of propagating this 
lie. Former Ku Klux Klan leader 
David Duke has spoken out 
extensively on the topic, referring 
to the land expropriation efforts as 
“white genocide.” Breitbart News 
Network, 
the 
self-proclaimed 
“platform for the alt right,” has 
published 
countless 
articles 
painting white farmers as helpless 
victims of their violent Black 

overlords.
“Alt-right” 
darling 
and 
popular 
YouTuber 
Lauren 
Southern 
recently 
came 
out 
with a documentary peddling 
the 
conspiracy 
theory 
called 
“Farmlands.” The film has been 
met with much-deserved backlash 
largely due to the fact that it’s 
little more than a collection of 
unverified anecdotes about white 
farmers who were victims of 
violence. Sad? Yes, but the film’s 
assertion that these instances are 
indicative of a broader trend is 
simply not true.
It’s worth noting Southern’s 
far-right activism has gotten 
her into trouble in the past. 
Back in 2017, she was detained 
by the Italian Coast Guard for 
attempting to block a refugee boat 
in the Mediterranean. She then 
was subsequently banned from 
entering the UK while on a trip to 
meet with Generation Identity—a 
neo-Nazi terrorist organization 
that has set up military—style 
training camps across Europe.
Trump’s propagation of this 
racist conspiracy theory is just the 
latest in a long line of instances in 
which he has marched in lockstep 
with these bad actors. In the past 
he called “alt right” protestors at 
Charlottesville “very fine people,” 
retweeted 
Islamophobic 
posts 
by the deputy leader of fascist 
political 
organization 
Britain 
First and retweeted a fake crime 
statistic published originally by 
a neo-Nazi group exaggerating 
Black on white murder rates. I 
could go on, but I won’t.
Trump no longer has the 
benefit of plausible deniability. 
Richard Spencer is not the face of 
the “alt-right”—Trump is. With 
the infiltration of such an ideology 
into the highest political office in 
our country, what were once the 
worst elements of the fringe have 
become the new mainstream. A 
serious swing of the pendulum 
will be needed, and fast, if we 
want to restore order.
Moreover, with Trump stating 
he ordered Secretary of State 
Mike 
Pompeo 
to 
investigate,

A brief history 

of grime

WORLD MUSIC COLUMN

I’ll 
admit it, grime 
isn’t 

everyone’s cup of tea. It is 
unapologetically 
in 
your 

face, abrasive and constantly 
energetic. 
But 
it’s 
these 

characteristics, combined with 
a rich history, that make it 
such an appealing genre, and 
one so embedded in current 
British music, so much so that 
one of the genre’s stalwarts, 
Wiley, received an MBE from 
the future king himself. While 
many argue that its best days 
were in a bygone era, the genre 
has experienced somewhat of 
a resurgence. Old figures and 
new, from Skepta to Kano to 
Dave, have revived the genre, 
or at least have released works 
that have some link to grime. 
Even Drake has collaborated 
with some of the genre’s biggest 
names. In a way, it is the perfect 
embodiment of modern music 
in general. Proliferated by the 
Internet, it has taken influences 
from cultures and movements 
from around the world to create 
a youthful expression of urban 
life.

While the genre itself is a 

relatively 
recent 
innovation, 

its history and influences go 
slightly further back. While the 
genre shares some ostensible 
similarities with American hip 
hop, it is a wholly unique form. 
Rather than drawing its earliest 
influences from soul, R&B and 
jazz, grime builds upon the rich 
electronic music tradition of the 
U.K., especially the traditions 
from 
the 
early-and-mid-’90s. 

This time, the peak of the 
original “rave” era continues 
to elicit nostalgia from those 
who participated in the illegal, 
ecstasy-filled warehouse shows 
themselves, as well as from those 
who weren’t even alive during 
them.

A 
far 
cry 
from 
the 

commercialized 
EDCs 
and 

Tomorrowlands of today, these 
raves were dingy, risky and, most 
importantly, an outpouring of 
the disillusionment of urban 
youth (especially among poorer, 
immigrant communities) in the 
country’s large cities in the post-
Thatcher era. Genres such as 
garage, jungle and drum n’ bass 
were at their peak, combining 
quick, uptempo rhythms with 
melodic touches. These genres 
themselves owe a lot to music 
made in Jamaica and Jamaican 
communities in the U.K., namely 
reggae and its more electronic 

cousin, ragga. Garage tracks 
operated around 130-140 bpm, 
while drum n’ bass elevated the 
energy to a frenetic pace of 160-
180 bpm.

An entire book can be written 

about the incredible scene that 
dominated the U.K. during this 
time, but what is important to 
realize about the scene is the 
sheer magnitude of its reach at 
the time and how multicultural 
and fluid it was. Far from being 
set in stone, beholden to a fixed 
set of characteristics, DJs at 
the time took influences from 
wherever 
they 
could 
from 

around the world, all while 

incorporating the unique identity 
of the growing immigrant groups 
in cities like London, Bristol and 
Manchester. 
This 
particular 

scene died down at the end of 
the decade and gave birth to the 
genre of dubstep, and eventually 
grime itself. The godfather of 
the genre, the aforementioned 
Wiley, adapted the breakbeat 
dominated sound of dubstep 
and combined it with energetic 
rapping to create a genre which 
he dubbed “Eskibeat” (aptly 
enough, he address this very 
topic in this iconic track).

In Wiley’s home city of 

London, other young artists 
contributed to the growth of this 
young genre. At just 19 years old, 
Dizzee Rascal released Boy in 
da Corner, an album which is to 
this day considered the genre’s 
Illmatic. Songs such as “I Luv 
U” and “Fix Up Look Sharp” 
are unmatched in their sheer 
ferocity, telling tales of urban, 
inner-city struggle intermingled 
with 
hilarious 
interludes 
of 

teenage life in general.

Wiley and Dizzee Rascal’s 

success led to arguably the 
genre’s most productive and 
influential years, with a host 
of new artists ready to take 
over London and the rest of the 
country by storm.

Have 
we 
reached 
“Purge” 

saturation? Four movies and now 
a TV show later, it’s hard to argue 
otherwise. Moreover, it’s not 
hard to understand the appeal. 
Although the premise of 12 hours 
of lawful lawlessness requires 
a good measure of suspending 
disbelief, the potential character 
studies and societal analyses 
are abundant. It is unfortunate 
that USA’s TV adaptation of the 
vaunted 
franchise 
continues 

perhaps its biggest flaw: The 

franchise never actually explores 
the philosophical questions it 
raises.

“The Purge” follows the same 

basic premise of the movies that 
preceded it. It is set in a dystopian 
version of the U.S., one ruled by 
a (somewhat overtly) nefarious 
political party called the “New 
Founding Fathers of America.” 
As usual, the NFFA institutes an 
annual 12-hour period in which all 
crime, including murder, is legal. 
This particular adaptation focuses 
on a set of new characters. Miguel 
(Gabriel Chavarria, “Lowriders”), 
a Marine, returns home to find his 
sister, who has joined a twisted 
death cult that promises eternal 
salvation during the Purge. The 
cult is one of the show’s strongest 
points, a genuinely unsettling 
part of a show that tries really 
hard (but usually fails) at being 

unsettling. In a world already 
increasingly filled with truly 
bizarre cults (looking at you 
Q-anon), it somehow feels like the 
most realistic of the organizations 
set up in the show.

Another 
storyline 
follows 

Jane (Amanda Warren, “The 
Leftovers”), a steely, determined 
finance executive who hires an 
assassin to potentially climb her 
way up the corporate ladder. 
Rick (Colin Woodell, “Unsane”) 
and Jenna (Hannah Anderson, 
“Jigsaw), a married pair of anti-
Purge socialites form the most 
mysterious storyline.

While all this seems at least 

somewhat compelling, it was 
quite impressive how badly the 
writers botched nearly every 
single 
aspect 
possible. 
“The 

Purge” is precisely the worst type 
of TV show, but not because it is a 
wholesale trainwreck. No, it does 
not give the viewer the morbid/
comic satisfaction of watching 
a trainwreck. Instead, it is the 

very definition of self-satisfied 
mediocrity. 
Maybe 
I’ve 
been 

spoiled by being able to watch so 
much great TV in this so-called 
“Golden Age” of the medium, but 
I can guarantee that the writers 
of the last couple “Purge” movies 
were impressed that someone 
could phone something in even 
harder than them.

Even though the characters are 

put in some tricky situations, it is 
extremely difficult to garner any 
modicum of sympathy for them. 
Throughout the pilot, the dialogue 
remains stiff and reveals absolutely 
nothing about the characters’ 
inner lives, fears, motivations or 
really anything at all to make them 
feel human. Rick and Jenna have 
all the chemistry of two strangers 
meeting on a blind date despite 
being a married couple; Jane’s 
ostensible anti-hero status is never 
solidified because there’s nothing 
the audience actually learns about 
her. Miguel, who is arguably the 
most sympathetic character, is 

little more than the classic noble 
soldier who returns home to face 
a new battle. My five-year-old 
cousin has told me stories with 
better developed characters.

The show could have used 

all of these stories to explore 
the nuanced aspects of human 
psychology and seek to answer 
the philosophical questions of 
morality, law, justice, etc. that 
surround a concept such as the 
Purge. What is the connection 
between enforcement of justice 
and morality? Is a legal system 
that can be switched on and off a 
valid one in the first place? Beats 
me. Shows like “The Good Place” 
prove that it is not impossible 
to 
balance 
easily 
digestible 

entertainment and the exploration 
of deeper themes. Unfortunately, 
even this edition of “The Purge” 
eschews these questions in favor 
of gratuitous violence, cheesy sex 
scenes and horror that elicits more 
cringe than horror. Don’t waste 
your time with it.

‘The Purge’ continues to follow its 
namesake franchise’s mediocrity

USA

The opening scene of “First 

Reformed” fades in from black to 
gradually illuminate a small white 
church. From there the film only 
gets darker.

The tired and ill Reverend 

Toller (Ethan Hawke, “Boyhood”) 

manages a struggling church in 
upstate New York. When a couple 
in his congregation asks for his 
counsel over a possible abortion, 
Toller descends into a crisis of 
faith. However, climate change, not 
abortion, becomes the subject of 
his troubles. The film begins with 
sincere, deep dialogue between 

reverend and parishioner. Toller 
and 
Michael 
(Philip 
Ettinger, 

“Indignation”), a recently jailed 
environmental activist and non-
believer in the church, engage in a 
frank conversation about the state 
of Earth’s climate. Michael has 
reached a state of despair so deep 
he does not want his wife Mary 
(Amanda Seyfried, “Mamma Mia! 
Here We Go Again”) to bring a 
child into this doomed society. 
The extended static conversation 
between the two men deceptively 
promises a slow-paced, entirely 
introspective 
film. 
However, 

“First Reformed” turns into an 
environmental-activism 
thriller, 

building momentum slowly and 
then all at once, just as climate 
change has as we damage our 
planet toward the point of no 
return.

As he accepts the reality of his 

failing health, Toller also rewrites 
the relationship between religion 
and science. Rather than pinning 
the two against each other, writer-
director Paul Schrader (“Taxi 

Driver”) shows these forces as 
working in harmony. There’s no 
battle between Charles Darwin’s 
theory of biological evolution and 
the Bible’s descriptions of how God 
created the world and all its beings, 
as one finds in schools throughout 
America. 
Instead, 
Schrader 

argues, concerning the issue of 
climate change, religious people — 
particularly Christians — should 
protect nature, or God’s creation, 
not destroy it or await His saving 
grace for all men’s sins; a notion in 
line with the recommendations of 
97 percent of scientists.

As a result of this development, 

Toller becomes the martyr for the 
cause to save our planet. He is the 
product of a convergence between 
science and religion. He is a human 
being living in a state of passive 
denial and passive resistance, 
eventually pushed to an act of 
extremity it’s a wonder the majority 
of us have not already reached. As a 
director, Schrader does not coddle 
his audience. He does not soften 
the truth that certain catastrophe 

awaits most of us in the near 
future and the rest of us now. In a 

stunningly devastating montage, 
Schrader contrasts natural beauty 
with the polluted hell-scape we 
have created. 

Although Toller discovers a 

conspiracy theory — that big-energy 
corporations 
are 
undermining 

efforts to save this planet for their 
own personal gain — no part of his 
discovery is fiction. His journey to 
understanding is not just a crisis 
of faith with his own church, but 
with the whole of humanity. As 
he realizes his own insignificance 
and helplessness to make change 
through individual action, the only 
option becomes clear. The question 
that haunts Reverend Toller will 
haunt all those who watch “First 
Reformed”: “Can God forgive us for 
what we’ve done to this world?” 

‘First Reformed’ refuses to show 
any sympathy toward humanity

Michigan Theater


Waxahatchee’s 
Katie 

Crutchfield 
has 
a 
musical 

style that seems to be an 
exploration of change as she 
has touched across the sounds 
of indie, folk and rock through 

her 
past 
four 
full-length 

releases. Her ability to claim 
a distinct musical voice while 
experimenting with different 
sounds has shown itself in 
her most recent release, Great 
Thunder. The EP stands as 
a separation from her rock 
heavy 2017 record, Out in the 
Storm, but remains as a stark 
representation of herself by 
revisiting both her past music 
writing experience and her 
country roots.

Great 
Thunder 
is 
a 

recollection and reshaping of 
six songs Crutchfield wrote 
with the now non-existent 
recording group that wore 
the same title as this recent 
EP. The rare and hard-to-find 
original collaborative tracks 
gave Crutchfield inspiration 
to 
rework 
their 
skeletons 

and bring them back with a 
clearer sound and a gripping 
emotional pull.

The EP is vulnerable in 

every sense of the word. 
Crutchfield’s 
strong, 

but 
breathy 
vocals 
stand 

alone with only soft piano 
instrumentals resting behind 
her, exposing every whine, cry 
and moment of breathlessness. 
This simple companionship 
creates a parallel between the 
production of sound in the EP 
and the emotions it evokes: 

loneliness and pain. These 
feelings 
become 
vocalized 

within the EP’s lyrical content 
and are introduced with the 
beginning track “Singer’s No 
Star” 
as 
Crutchfield 
cries 

“We get comfortable with 
our detachment to our oldest 
friends / And you got me here 
where I’m left alone / I’m 
not the only thing you ever 
left.” Not only do these lines 
surface an air of loneliness, 
they introduce a haunting 
remembrance for a time that 
was that only becomes stronger 
as the EP moves along.

This 
turmoil 
becomes 

exaggerated through each song 
as 
Crutchfield’s 
beautifully 

melodic vocals slip away into 
soft whispers that feel almost 
unfinished, leaving listeners 
with high pitched sighs full of 
yearning. This flowing change 
in her voice instills a feeling 
close to regret. A painful 
emptiness that settles at the 
bottom of your chest when you 
remember something you want 
to forget, like an ex-lover’s 
favorite song or the color of 
their bedsheets.

But, as soon as Crutchfield’s 

whispers fade out into nothing, 
her vocals come back with an 
intensity that sends shivers up 
your spine, flooding your eyes 
with the color blue, creating a 
feeling of abandonment. She 
sings of this abandonment in 
the song “You Left Me With 
an Ocean,” with a heavy voice 
that rings with melancholy.

And 
even 
though 

Crutchfield’s voice is weighed 
down by this loneliness, as 
the EP nears the end there is a 
sign of submission, a desire to 
return and try again after all 
of the hurt. In the final song, 
“Take So Much,” Crutchfield 
begs this person she has been 
addressing through the entire 
EP to come back to find support 
in her: “Take it out / Take it 
out / Take it on me baby,” she 

sings, leaving these isolating, 
vulnerable emotions to linger 
without resolution. After this 

EP draws out intense feelings 
of 
desolation 
and 
despair, 

Crutchfield leaves us without 
closure, 
like 
most 
of 
our 

haunting memories do. Once 
the music stops, there are only 
her haunting sweet voice, a 
complacent sadness and you.

I spend an unusual amount 

of 
time 
thinking 
about 

eyelashes. This is a fairly new 
development, considering I 
used to think about eyelashes 
strictly in a making-a-wish-
and-blowing-it-away context. 
I’m Jewish and superstitious, 
sue me. Now, I think about 
eyelashes, and the inadequacy 
of my own, on a regular basis. 
My summer in Los Angeles 
quickly exposed me to the 
fact that my human-length 
eyelashes were blatantly below 
average next to the whiskers 
that flutter out of the fairer, 
Southern Californian eyelids. 
These eyelashes can protect 
even the most sensitive eyes 
from desert sandstorms, I’m 
sure of it.

The life and maintenance 

of these eyelashes requires a 
separate checking account. 
The down payment is about 
300 dollars, which is nothing 
compared to the three hours 
it takes to individually glue 
the camel whiskers to your 
individual 
human 
hairs, 

which you surely despise by 
now. A biweekly rent payment 
of 
60 
dollars 
(excluding 

gratuity to your aesthetician, 
obviously) is due to re-glue the 
eyelashes that have fallen out 
because, guess what, you’re 
still a human that sheds hair. 
It’s unclear if fallen eyelash 
extensions can still cash in for 
wishes. I will investigate, and 
probably wish for girthier eye 
hairs.

The point — and there is a 

point — is that I made 11 dollars 
an hour sorting mail this 
summer. Thus, I did not get 
eyelash extensions, although 
I cannot help but think that, 
had my eyelashes been a 
couple 
centimeters 
longer, 

more men would have bought 
me the astronomically priced 
Los Angeles cocktails that I 
couldn’t afford. Economically 
speaking, 
eyelashes 
would 

have been an investment.

I blame my eyelashes for 

loneliness and allergies. If 
this one thing was different 
about me, I think, life would 

be better. My phone knows 
this, because it listens to my 
darkest thoughts and desires, 
and slyly places a Glossier 
ad for their Lash Stick on 
my Instagram feed. The ad 
promises long, lush lashes that 
look as if they were genetically 
programmed to be just so. 
Full disclosure: Glossier could 
package rat poison in a baby 
pink bottle and I would gladly 
pay upward of 20 bucks for it.

So, I stand in line for 30 

minutes to spend my hard-
earned 
paycheck 
in 
the 

Glossier store on Melrose. 
I get the Lash Stick and the 
Cherry Lip Tint that makes 
my lips look flushed and 
virginal and will thwart the 
impending thoughts of lip 
injections for at least a little 
while longer.

However, 
I 
hate 
cherry 

flavored anything because it 
tastes like chewable Tylenol. 

I decide to wash down the 
unbearable taste of my lips 
with a large iced almond milk 
matcha latte, unsweetened. I 
have just spent $7.50 on green 
tea, which I firmly believe 
is just badly flavored water. 
I drink it anyway because 
Gwyneth Paltrow swears by 
it and I secretly think she is 
magic.

Gwyneth also swears by 

CBD oil. CBD oil comes from 
cannabis, and it will not 
make you high. But, if you 
infuse CBD oil into Icelandic 
fairytale water, it will replace 
your 
medically 
diagnosed 

anxiety with eternal bliss 
and an eligible bachelor. Or 
something like that.

Regardless, 
I 
drink 
the 

matcha and hope for supple 
cuticles 
and 
brighter 
eye 

whites. 
Along 
with 
my 

stumpy eyelashes, I learned 
that the whites of my eyes 
are 
unacceptably 
off-

white, eggshell at best. An 
“influencer” tells me that 
superfoods like chia seeds 
and matcha and goji berries 
will strip my eye whites of any 
unwanted pigments, and so I 
go to Whole Foods. I suddenly 
have 
a 
deep, 
unhindered 

desire for my eye whites to 
look like effin’ porcelain.

I go to hot yoga, even though 

I’ve fainted in a hot yoga class 
before. One minute I’m doing 
a sun salutation and the next 
I’m waking up on my back to a 
room full of yogis whose Zen 
I have totally botched. But I 
know that I have toxins, and 
they need to be sweated out. 
I brave the torture workout 
sauna chamber once again.

The yoga instructor has 

just come back from a detox in 
Ibiza. No sugar, no alcohol, no 
dairy, no meat. I think this is 
no fun. The mind gives up way 
before the body, she tells the 
yogis. So don’t take any water 
breaks during the flow.

It takes me 20 minutes to 

drive the two miles from the 
yoga studio to my apartment. 
I listen to “Pete Davidson” on 
Ariana Grande’s new album 
and go into a mild depression 
thinking about Cazzie David, 
Pete Davidson’s ex. This is 
something that upsets me 
more than eyelashes.

Detroit 
and 
Zimbabwean 

cultures collide as the JIT 
Exchange puts the two into 

dialogue through music and 
dance in the UMMA’s Museum 
Apse this Thursday, Sept. 14.

The 
performance 
will 

feature Detroit dancer and 
choreographer, 
Haleem 

“Stringz” Rasul, Zimbabwean 
guitarist Mono Mukundu and 
SMTD grads of the E. Reid JIT 
Coalition: Everett Reid, Alexis 
Lombre and Marcus Elliot.

Thursday’s performance is 

just one part of a much “bigger 
narrative,” Rasul explained. 
What started off as just a video 
exchange between Rasul and 
Zimbabwean dancer Franco 
“Slomo” Dakha, the exchange 
program grew as Rasul began 
his own time in Zimbabwe.

The JIT exchange is hosted 

by the University’s Center 
for 
World 
Performance 

Studies and the Department 
of Afroamerican and African 

Studies in collaboration with 
the Zimbabwe Cultural Centre 
of Detroit. The event will 
be a conversation between 
Detroit’s Jit and Zimbabwe’s 
Jiti, two distinct styles of 
music and dance.

In 2015, Rasul spent five 

weeks researching, facilitating 
workshops, 
teaching 
and 

meeting different artists in 
three different Zimbabwean 
cities: Harare, Mutare and 
Bulawayo. 
Immersed 
in 

Zimbabwean culture, Rasul 
collaborated 
with 
Dakha, 

facilitated Jibilika — a dance 
competition and festival — and 
was documented day by day by

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

“JIT Exchange”

7 p.m. - 8 p.m.

UMMA

Free

“(The 
exchange) 
opened 

up the door for everything 
else to follow,” Rasul said. 
As connections were made 
and relationships grew, the 
foundations for the upcoming 
performance were built.

For those unfamiliar, Detroit 

Jit is a regional dance style 
which emerged in the 1970s, 
comprised of fast footwork, 
armwork and floorwork, and 
accompanied by beat-heavy 
music. Around the same time, 
a Zimbabwean music genre 
called Jiti emerged. The JIT 
exchange will bring Jit and 
Jiti together into the same 
space as the artists respond to 
each other and to the unique 
aspects of each style. Through 
music and dance, a cultural 
dialogue will emerge.

Though 
the 
two 
styles 

emerged 
through 
distinct 

cultural 
contexts, 
they 

originated in the same era. 
As a result, similarities can 
be 
seen. 
One 
particular 

similarity is Detroit Jit’s Funk 
Shuffle and Zimbabwean Jiti’s 
Borrowdale, two movements 
which developed on opposite 
sides 
of 
the 
world, 
yet 

incorporate the same pacing 
with the feet.

While 
both 
styles 

incorporate 
fast 
footwork, 

Jit and Jiti each have distinct 
elements stemming from their 
cultural roots.

“I’ve tried to Jit to their 

music and likewise, and it’s 
just a different feel with their 
music — their music is very 
guitar based and ours is more 
beat and percussion based,” 
Rasul said. “Zimbabwean Jiti 
has a lot of hip movement. We 
have hip movement too, but it’s 
coming from a different place, 
you know, we feel a vibe.”

Music 
predominantly 

determines the feel of the 
dance 
which 
accompanies 

it. Through the tempo, the 
rhythm, the instruments used 

and the character, a dancer 
feels the music and moves with 
the music. The music inspires 
a unique set of moves and a 
particular feel which give way 
to the dance style.

While the original intention 

was to bring Dakha to Detroit 
for the second phase of the 
exchange program and the 
Thursday performance, visa 
complications 
delayed 
the 

exchange. As a result, the 
performance will be more 
heavily focused on the music 
of Jiti while Rasul responds 
in dance. Rather than routines 
choreographed collaboratively 
by Dakha and Rasul, the 
performance will be more of an 
improvisational performance 
between Zimbabwean music 
and the Detroit Jit. More 
spontaneous in style than a 
choreographed routine, the 
performance is sure to bring 
out new ideas and moves.

The 
JIT 
Exchange 
will 

bring attention to two dynamic 
cultures: one rooted across the 
world and the other just 40 
minutes outside of Ann Arbor. 
The exchange will continue 
on as Rasul brings his own 
experience home to perform, 
to educate and to promote 
both Detroit and Zimbabwean 
culture.

“I hope people get inspired 

to 
learn 
something 
new,” 

Hasul said.

Detroit has so much to offer 

in art and ideas, and while it 
is so close to Ann Arbor, there 
is a vast unawareness of past 
and current ongoings. While 
Hasul 
traveled 
to 
another 

continent to experience and 
learn from another culture, 
the JIT Exchange will bring 
two unique cultures right here 
to Ann Arbor, and leave the 
audience ready for more.

It took one offensive drive for 

angry boos to cascade Michigan 
Stadium, and then the next one to 
make it seem like it never happened.

After Shea Patterson completed 

a 10-yard out to senior tight end 
Zach Gentry on the game’s first 
play against Western Michigan, 
the offense followed with a false 
start, two short runs and a stifled 
screen pass. The Michigan offense 
from last week appeared to show up 
again in its home opener.

Then, the Wolverines’ defense 

stymied the Broncos on the 
following drive to get the ball back. 
Senior running back Karan Higdon 
charged down the field on a 43-yard 
run to get into the redzone, setting 
up a 17-yard touchdown reception 
for junior tight end Sean McKeon.

From then on, boos turned into 

sustained cheers. Higdon broke 
off a 67-yard touchdown run a 
drive later. After an interception by 
linebacker Noah Furbush the next 
defensive possession, junior Chris 

Evans converted a 27-yard score 
of his own. Michigan (1-1 overall) 
threw Western Michigan (0-2) 
around like a ragdoll and didn’t stop 
en route to a comfortable 49-3 win.

“Obviously there’s a lot of people 

talking about us, Michigan is 
always a hot topic,” Higdon said. “I 
think we took that today and threw 
it back.”

Just in the first half, Higdon 

carried the ball 13 times for 156 yards 
and a score, while his counterpart 
Evans had two touchdowns. The 
tandem combined for 282 yards and 
three touchdowns.

“All those holes, you could drive 

a car through it,” Evans said of the 
run blocking. “People in there with 
nobody to block, because everybody 
was taken care of, and the running 
backs try to make everyone’s job 
easier.”

Rushing 
success 
against 

porous defenses is familiar for 
the Wolverines. But Saturday 
afternoon’s contest was also a game 
of firsts.

Patterson’s touchdown throw 

to McKeon was his first in his 

Michigan 
career. 
With 
7:02 

remaining in the second quarter, 
Patterson rainbowed a ball right 
into the hands of sophomore wide 
receiver Nico Collins for a 44-yard 
touchdown — the first collegiate 
score for Collins, and the first for 
any Michigan wide receiver since 
Sept. 9, 2017. And with 6:21 in the 
third quarter, 
Patterson 
connected 
with 
sophomore 
Donovan 
Peoples-Jones 
for his first 
collegiate 
receiving 
score.

During 

garbage 
time 
in 
the 
fourth 

quarter, redshirt freshman Dylan 
McCaffrey 
replaced 
Patterson 

under center and threw his 
first career touchdown pass to 
sophomore receiver Jake McCurry 
for his introduction into the 
endzone.

But throughout the afternoon, 

it was squarely Patterson who 
inspired confidence amongst an oft-
questioned passing offense. Even 
when facing pressure, the junior 
quarterback, who finished the day 
12-for-17 with 125 yards and three 
touchdowns, made plays with both 
his arm and legs to convert first 
downs that were unimaginable 

only a year 
ago. 

“Our o-line 

had a heck 
of a game,” 
Patterson said. 
“I don’t think 
I’ve ever seen 
holes open up 
that wide. Just 
the way that 
we ran the 

ball opened up so much more in our 
passing game. Got the safeties to 
come down and play in the box and 
expect the run.”

Added Higdon: “He stayed 

poised. He stood tall in the pocket 
whenever the offense needed to 
throw the ball. We got plays out of 
him.”

The relative improvement of 

the offense overshadowed another 
picturesque output by the defense. 
After 
Furbush’s 
interception, 

junior VIPER Khaleke Hudson 
led the way with a blocked punt 
and six tackles. Junior defensive 
end Rashan Gary also recorded six 
tackles and his first sack of the year, 
amongst the unit’s eight tackles-for-
loss.

Overall, the defense allowed just 

208 total yards — 2.8 yards per play 
— to a Western Michigan team that 
put up 42 points and 621 yards only 
a week ago.

“I love wearing that hard hat,” 

Gary said of the pressure he faced 
from the Broncos’ offense. “You 
can double-, triple-team me. I’ve got 
Devin Bush coming off the edge, 
I’ve got Chase Winovich coming at 
him, Khaleke Hudson, I can keep 
going and not leave one person out.”

The sizable margin maintained 

by the defense allowed Jim 
Harbaugh to experiment with his 
team. Under new redshirt rules that 
allows players to play in up to four 
games while maintaining redshirt 

eligibility, the entire offensive line 
was replaced on McCaffrey’s drive. 
Junior walk-on running back Tru 
Wilson also saw game action, 
adding six carries for 54 yards in 
the No. 3 spot.

“Good to see our young offensive 

linemen get the snaps they did,” 
Harbaugh said. Good for (them and 
McCaffrey), getting a lot of guys out 
there playing — I think 74 players 
played in the game and did things, 
too.”

But there was still time for boos 

to rain down in Michigan Stadium. 
With 2:34 remaining, and after a 
blocked field goal was wiped away 
from an offsides call committed 
by the Wolverines, the Broncos 
converted one on the following 
play to the dismay of the Michigan 
faithful in attendance.

It was a blemish on an otherwise 

flawless bounceback display by the 
Wolverines, albeit against a weaker 
Western Michigan team. And if 
nothing else, Saturday’s game was 
one step closer to fixing the issues 
that have continually plagued 
Michigan.

A gunslinger comes to town
A 

gunslinger walked into 

Michigan 
Stadium on 
Saturday 
afternoon, 
and no, 
it wasn’t 
Western 
Michigan 
quarterback 
Jon 
Wassink.
After nine months, Shea 
Patterson played his first 
game at home. And if you’re 
a Michigan football fan, the 
wait was well worth it.
Patterson, of course, went 
up against a team some would 
politely describe as a ‘tomato 
can.’ His overall numbers — 
12-of-17 passing, 125 yards, 
3 touchdowns — weren’t 
amazing.
Who the hell cares? There 
are three throws I want 
to bring to your attention. 
You can go watch them on 
YouTube again, if you need 
any refreshing. 
1st quarter, 10:14: Patterson 
rolls to his left off of play-
action. Tight end in the flats 
is covered. Patterson keeps 
running. And running. Then 
he twists, throws across 
his body — and finds Oliver 
Martin on the sideline.
2nd quarter, 2:09: Patterson 
rolls to his right this time. 
Within seconds, he’s already 
more than 10 yards behind the 
line of scrimmage. A Western 
Michigan defender dives and 
misses. Patterson continues to 
roll right … he brings his left 
arm in the air for an instant, 
as if he’s directing traffic … 
and then he uncorks a dart to 
Donovan Peoples-Jones, who 
is more than 20 yards upfield 
on the right sideline.
3rd quarter, 6:26: 3rd-and-
goal, Patterson working out 
of the shotgun, looks, still 
looking, off his first read now, 

then he tosses the ball to the 
corner, where ...
Okay. Let me stop you there. 
At that moment, how many 
of you assumed, based on 
the past year of throws out 
of bounds … 
throws sailing 
out of the back 
of the end zone 
... throws that 
had no chance 
of finding a 
receiver … 
that Patterson 
was going to 
find Peoples-
Jones for a 
touchdown?
How many of you thought, 
as you watched Patterson 
bring his arm forward, that 

the ball was going to be 
caught?
I mean, I didn’t.
Jim Harbaugh told the 
story behind the play after 
the game. Michigan thought 
it had the right 
play called. 
The primary 
read was Nico 
Collins, who ran 
a slant from the 
outside receiver 
position on 
the boundary. 
Harbaugh 
thought that 
was where 
the ball would 
go. Then he saw a Western 
Michigan linebacker drop into 
that space.

Patterson saw that, too.
“For him to calculate that, 
and then change the channel 
— if I was playing quarterback, 
that’s where I’d have been 
going with the ball, reading 
the initial 
coverage,” 
Harbaugh said. 
“To change the 
channel and go 
to the corner, 
and throw it to 
Donovan, (to) 
make that split-
second decision 
and then make 
that accurate of 
a throw, you’re 
really seeing things well.”
Last week, Patterson 
saw things well against the 

Fighting Irish, too, only 
sometimes that meant he saw 
three Notre Dame defensive 
linemen running straight at 
him. A quarterback can’t be 
expected to do everything by 
himself for an 
entire game. 
He needs his 
receivers to 
catch the ball, 
his offensive 
line to block and 
his coaching 
staff to put him 
in a position to 
succeed.
But 
sometimes, 
even when some of those 
things go wrong — let’s say the 
receivers can’t get open, or the 

offensive line doesn’t protect 
the pocket for long enough, or 
the play called doesn’t work as 
intended — a good quarterback 
can make things look okay. He 
can roll out, to his left or to 
his right, and buy some time 
for his receivers to work their 
way back to the ball before 
hitting them in the tightest 
of windows on the sideline. 
He can look off his first read 
when a linebacker drops into 
the space where the ball is 
supposed to be delivered, and 
throw a perfectly-placed ball 
that would make Jon Gruden 
swoon.
The third touchdown, the 
one to Peoples-Jones, was 
the type of throw I could see 
Patterson making all the way 
back in December, when he 
first announced his transfer 
to Michigan. I wrote a column 
about him then, too.
Some of it hasn’t aged 
well — “There’s no squinting 
required to predict a season 
that ends with Michigan’s 
first appearance in the College 
Football Playoff.”
Well, that was before I saw 
the offensive line at Notre 
Dame.
Some of it has aged better 
— “Shea Patterson doesn’t 
project to be good. He is 
good.”
Michigan’s quarterbacks 
combined for nine touchdowns 
all of last season. Patterson 
threw for three in the first 
three quarters against the 
Broncos. 
And then, of course, there’s 
the headline: “Patterson 
would be difference-maker at 
Michigan.”
Shea Patterson would be 
a difference-maker at a lot 
of schools. He already is a 
difference-maker at Michigan. 
Would anyone disagree?

AMERLIA CACCHIONE/Daily
Junior quarterback Shea Patterson played in his first game at Michigan Stadium on Saturday, racking up 125 yards and three touchdowns against Western Michigan.

A necessary blowout
B

efore the benches emp-

tied and the 
blowout took 
shape, ten-
sion ferment-
ed inside 
Michigan 
Stadium. As 
the Wolver-
ines’ offense 
jogged off the 
field after a 
fruitless opening drive against 
Western Michigan on Saturday, 
boos rained down onto the field.
Fans had just seen Michigan 
shoot itself in the foot yet again. 
This time, a timeout followed 
by a false start penalty just 40 
seconds into the game led to 
a conservative, discombobu-
lated series for the Wolverines’ 
offense. Last week, it was the 
offensive line’s litany of mis-
takes that allowed Michigan 
to score only one offensive 
touchdown at then-No. 12 Notre 
Dame.
The boo birds were hasty 
— patience has never been a 
hallmark of any college football 
fanbase. But they weren’t com-
pletely baseless.
Everyone has heard the Wol-
verines’ unseemly stats. A 9-9 
record dating back to November 
of 2016. Zero wins in their last 
four games. Another loss to a 
rival.
“There was a feeling everyone 
wanted to get rid of (this week),” 
said Michigan coach Jim Har-
baugh.
Much of that has been tied to 
Michigan’s offensive struggles, 
which were well summarized 
during its first five plays from 
scrimmage. The penalty, confu-
sion and boos made that quite 
clear.
But what happened the rest of 
the game should inspire much 
needed confidence in the Wol-
verines. Michigan dominated 
with 49 points, 451 yards of total 
offense, a touchdown catch by 
wide receiver — something that 
hadn’t occurred in exactly 364 
days — and then two more.
“There were a lot of questions 
about our offense, and I think 

we put a close to that today,” 
said senior running back Karan 
Higdon. “… I think it’s a great 
kickstart for us.”
So how did the Wolverines’ 
offense improve so much in 
one week? Well, the opponent 
certainly matters. The Broncos’ 
front seven is not close to as tal-
ented or physically dominant as 
that of Notre Dame.
But it also goes back to that 
emotion of losing — a pain that 
Harbaugh says hurts both his 
“mind and body.” You can bet 
he expects his players to feel 
the same way, and thus began a 
hyper-focused week of practice.
“Notre Dame punched us 
in the mouth because we were 
laughing and taking everything 
for granted,” said junior run-
ning back Chris Evans. “But 
this week we were a lot more 
focused.
“We’re not allowing all those 
smiles no more. We’re strictly 
business unless we’re outside 
the lines after practice.”
In his post-game press con-
ference, Harbaugh also men-
tioned he noticed none of his 

players “flinching” or “asking 
to come out” during 90-plus 
degree practices on Tuesday 
and Wednesday. It’s all a cli-
ché — “a good week of practice” 
is almost always coach-speak. 
Still, last week’s loss seems to 
have genuinely sparked the 
Wolverines, just as it should 
have.
“I just think the expectation 
we have for ourselves and then 
meeting something else with 
the loss to Notre Dame, it was 
a little different this time,” said 
fifth-year senior defensive end 
Chase Winovich. “We knew we 
had to get it out, and we knew 
this was the week.”
A win wasn’t all that was 
necessary, however. Michigan 
needed a dominant performance 
— something to temporarily 
reverse the negative narrative 
that’s justly surrounded the 
program’s recent performances. 
And for the first time in nearly 
two seasons, the Wolverines 
finally got their domineering 
rout.
“It feels good (to win like 
that),” Winovich said. “Coach 

Harbaugh used to say to us 
last year — he hasn’t said it in 
a while — ‘It doesn’t have to be 
close. You don’t have to keep 
people in the game, there’s no 
rule that says we have to.’ ”
Immense pressure is a real-
ity at Michigan. Losing, even 
in season-openers on the road, 
only amplifies that burden. 
Some national pundits suggest-
ed last week was the beginning 
of the end for Harbaugh in Ann 
Arbor. Even University Presi-
dent Mark Schlissel, for the first 
time in his tenure, answered 
questions about the coach’s job 
security on Wednesday.
But on Saturday, the Wol-
verines quieted that noise and 
those boo birds by thrashing 
Western Michigan. Finally, 
Michigan can take its breath.
“Obviously, there are a lot 
of people talking about us — 
Michigan’s always a hot topic,” 
Higdon said. “I think we took 
that today and threw it back.”

FOOTBALL
The good, the bad and 
the ugly: ‘M’ vs. WMU

The Michigan football team 
that 
played 
against 
Western 
Michigan was the team that most 
fans dreamed about heading into 
this season.
From the second drive on, the 
Wolverines dominated every facet 
of the game en route to a 49-3 win 
— the most points Michigan has 
scored since 2016.
The Daily breaks down the 
good, the bad and the ugly from 
the blowout.
The Good:
Junior 
quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson showed exactly why 
people were so excited about him 
before the season.
He showed his mobility on 
several occasions and his arm 
strength on several more. He 
finished with just 125 yards 
passing but three touchdowns, 
including 
the 
first 
receiving 
touchdown 
by 
a 
Wolverines 
receiver in 364 days.
The 
kicker 
to 
Patterson’s 
success is that he actually had time 
to throw this week.
The offensive line, unlike last 
week, protected Patterson well, 
and they also opened huge running 
lanes for junior running back Chris 
Evans and senior Karan Higdon.
Higdon had 140 yards in the 
first quarter alone, and Evans ran 
for two touchdowns.
“There was holes you could 
drive a car through, and people 
in there with nobody to block, 
because everybody was blocked 
and taken care of,” Evans said.
On 
the 
defensive 
side 
of 
things, the Wolverines were just 
as dominant. The Broncos did 
manage 208 yards, but until late in 
the game, when the backups were 
in, they didn’t get any deeper into 
Michigan territory than the 44 
yard line.
The only reason the Wolverines 
didn’t get the shutout was because 
Western Michigan decided to kick 
a meaningless field goal on 4th and 
10 at the end of the game rather 
than make any effort at a comeback 

attempt.
“Their offense, I think, going 
into the game — I’d have to go back 
and watch — but I felt like they 
came in and basically said, ‘
The Bad:
There really isn’t much bad. 
In fact, it’s really hard to say that 
there was any bad.
The one facet of Michigan’s 
game that was at all concerning 
was that redshirt sophomore 
kicker Quinn Nordin missed a 
39-yard field goal.
This wouldn’t be an issue if 
Nordin hadn’t been shaky down 
the stretch last season. But he was, 
missing an extra point against 
Penn State, Minnesota and Ohio 
State, and missing three straight 
field 
goals 
against 
Rutgers, 
Minnesota and Maryland.
Nordin still clearly has the 
talent, and there likely isn’t a kicker 
controversy or anything, but the 
Wolverines have to be at least a 
little perturbed by Nordin’s miss.
The Ugly:
You’ll 
notice 
that 
at 
the 
beginning of the story, it says “from 
the second drive on.” That’s the 
because Michigan’s first drive of 
the game was a mess.
The Wolverines got the ball first, 
and the first place was a first down 
toss from Patterson to redshirt 
junior tight end Zach Gentry.
Then things went sour.
Patterson had to call a timeout 
after what seemed like personnel 
confusion. When Michigan came 
back on the field from the timeout, 
fifth-year 
senior 
right 
tackle 
Juwann Bushell-Beatty moved 
early and incurred a false start 
penalty.
The next two plays were two-
yard runs from Higdon, and the 
one after that was a pass to Evans 
out of the backfield that netted 
zero yards.
The Michigan Stadium crowd 
actually booed the unit as they ran 
off the field. That was absolutely 
not a preview of things to come, 
but at least for a moment, it looked 
like the Wolverines’ offensive woes 
against the Fighting Irish might 
bleed into this game too.

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh admitted that his team wanted to get rid of the bad feelign they had after Michigan.

Wolverines move to 9-0 thanks to Jones

Michigan up 24-23 in the 
third set against Colorado 
State, 
Wolverines’ 
senior 
libero Jenna Lerg received 
the Rams’ serve as the fans 
chanted “Let’s.” Junior middle 
blocker 
MacKenzi 
Welsh 
was next in line and set the 
ball as “Go” echoed through 
the arena. On the other end 
of Welsh’s set was freshman 
outside hitter Paige Jones, 
who promptly spiked the ball 
for the final point of the set as 
the crowd yelled “Blue!!!” 
In Michigan’s final match 
of the Michigan Challenge, 
the 
Wolverines 
(9-0) 
took 
care of Colorado State (6-3) 
in three sets, 25-21, 25-23 
and 25-18, behind a dominant 
performance by Jones. In her 
best showing of the young 
season, the freshman notched 
25 points with 18 kills and 
seven 
aces, 
including 
an 
impressive six aces in the 
first set alone. Senior Carly 
Skojdt and redshirt junior 
Cori 
Crocker 
contributed 
seven-and-a-half 
and 
eight 
points respectively, but the 
upperclassmen stood back as 
Jones had her moment.
“Even when we didn’t have 
balance, this all-star right here 
just kinda took care of the ball, 
which is really not normal for 
our team, but she like blew it 
out,” Crocker said of Jones. 
“Even when we were balanced 
… she took care of the ball 
wherever she was.” 
After a back and forth affair 
early in the first set and with 
Michigan down 13-10, Jones 
delivered a ferocious spike 
right in the center of several 
Rams players to help ignite a 
seven-point run. Two serves 
later, she would follow up 
with back-to-back aces before 
adding yet another ace to take 
a 17-13 lead all during the 
seven-point stretch. 
Colorado State tried to inch 

its way back into the set, but 
was never able to fully close 
the gap as, of course, Jones 
nailed her sixth ace to win the 
set. 
“In the first play they get us 
out of system, they set the ball 
to Paige out of system and she 
bangs the ball off of the hands 
for a kill and I was just like 
‘Way to follow directions!’ ” 
Wolverines coach Mark Rosen 
said. “I thought that was a 
great approach and I think 
that set the tone for the rest 
of the team because they were 
like ‘Hey, that’s what we’re 
supposed to do and it worked.’ 
“The more aggressive we 
were in the first game, the 
more we were paid for it. I 
think that summed up (Jones’) 
match, it’s just how she started 
it really set the tone.”
The second set was also 
highly competitive. This time, 
however, Michigan did not put 
together any big scoring run 
and did not fully pull ahead 
until the very end of the set. 

Up 23-20, the Wolverines 
looked poised to put the set 
away. Two Jones mistakes 
gave the Rams life. But that 
was extinguished by a Crocker 
kill before Skodjt finished off 
the set for good. 
“I think that one of the 
things about tonight’s game 
is that, for the first time, we 
came out not on our right 
foot,” 
Crocker 
said. 
“We 
started out, we seemed a little 
bit timid or whatever emotions 
I think kind of got the best of 
us for a little bit in the first set. 
That’s the first time that it’s 
happened this (season), that 
that struggle has kind of hit us 
and we battled back.”
After close first and second 
sets 
Michigan 
flipped 
a 
switch before the third, and 
ultimately final, set.
The 
Wolverines 
scored 
the first point of the set on a 
service error by Colorado State 
and did not relinquish the lead 
from that moment on. Sparked 
by an early four-point run, 

Michigan took a 10-5 lead and 
dominated the rest of the set. 
“Our team did a great job 
of once we got them a little on 
their heels in that third set, 
we jumped on them pretty 
well and that (made) life a 
lot easier,” Rosen said. “I just 
thought that we did a great 
job.”
Going 
forward, 
the 
Wolverines know they cannot 
rely on these types of stellar 
performances 
from 
Jones 
alone and must play a complete 
team game. Rosen, Crocker 
and Jones, though, are not 
concerned, as they claim the 
depth of the team means that 
anyone can step up on any day. 
“Sometimes you just have 
your night,” Jones said on her 
performance. 
“Sometimes 
it’s me, sometimes it’s Cori, 
sometimes it’s Carly. I just 
think that’s the great thing 
about this team, that if one 
person can’t perform, there’s 
another person that’s gonna 
step up.”

Emma Way nets two 
game-winners for ‘M’

Maybe it was a coincidence or 
maybe it was fate.
One minute and 47 seconds into 
overtime, senior forward Emma 
Way scored the game-winning 
goal — on Friday against Pacific 
(3-3 overall) and then again on 
Sunday against Monmouth (2-4).
To the second.
And the timing of the golden 
goals wasn’t the only similarity 
between the two games. Both 
times, the Michigan field hockey 
team (3-3) dominated possession for 
most of the contest, but struggled to 
finish its opportunities. Both times, 
it went to overtime tied 1-1. And 
both times, Way put the team on 
her back and carried it to victory 
anyway.
Early in the second half against 
the Tigers, senior back Regan 
Leavitt took a penalty corner — the 
Wolverines’ seventh of the game. 
She passed the ball to freshman 
midfielder Kathryn Peterson, who 
passed it to Way, who connected, 
finally, with a successful shot.
The dearth of early goals hadn’t 
been for lack of trying, though. 
The seventh-ranked Wolverines 
dominated possession throughout. 
With the exception of one period 
with 
three 
straight 
penalty 
corners 
by 
Pacific, 
Michigan 
constantly had the ball in the 
Tigers’ territory. However, the 
Wolverines’ execution was never 
quite right, and their shots were 
blocked or saved.
The 
second 
half 
was, 
by 
and large, more of the same. 
Michigan drew several corners, 
forced turnovers and stifled any 
possession by Pacific. For a time, it 
seemed as if the Wolverines’ early 
score would hold, but seconds 
after a timeout 25 minutes into the 
period, the Tigers tipped a shot in 
from the right sideline, and just 
like that the score was tied.
It took until overtime — when 

Way intercepted an errant pass in 
the Bears’ territory and took it to 
the goal — for Michigan to finally 
secure the win.
“I 
knew 
the 
second 
she 
intercepted the ball she was 
gonna score,” said Michigan coach 
Marcia Pankratz. “ … She’s very 
dangerous.”
On Sunday, the script was nearly 
identical. 
Early 
opportunities 
dissolved with the Wolverines’ 
inability to finish. The Hawks 
scored first on a tip in from the left 
post late in the first half. Despite 
going into halftime with 11 shots 
and four corners to Monmouth’s 
two 
and 
three, 
respectively, 
Michigan was down 1-0.
But 
in 
the 
second 
half, 
Dowthwaite intercepted a pass 
and 
drew 
a 
penalty 
stroke. 
Sophomore midfielder Kayla Reed 
took the direct shot and connected 
for the equalizer. But again, despite 
commanding the possession, the 
Wolverines failed to score for the 
rest of the game.
“A goal really lifts the intensity 
of the team and the momentum 
of the team, so it really flipped it 
around,” Reed said. “I think after 
that, we kind of all hyped up a lot 
more and had a lot more scoring 
opportunities, but unfortunately 
we couldn’t put them away.”
Then came overtime, and after 
a green card on a Hawks player, 
Michigan drew a corner. Way’s 
shot found the left corner of the 
cage with 8:17 remaining in the 
period — the exact same game 
time she had scored the game-
winner against Pacific.
On a weekend when not much 
was going right for the Wolverines, 
Way came through again and 
again, and as the players mobbed 
her after the game, the missed 
chances were all but forgotten.
“We’re really calm, we know 
what we’re doing, we have the set 
game plan, and I believe in all their 
skills,” Reed said. “When it comes 
to overtime, I’m real confident.”

Wolverines dominate 
Central Michigan, 6-1

In the 70th minute, Central 
Michigan forward Lexi Pelafas 
sprinted down the right side to 
receive a through ball near the 
box. Pelafas was in a foot race 
with her defender, but used 
her physicality to shrug off 
the opponent and win the ball. 
Staring straight at the keeper, 
she hammered a shot off the 
inside of the left post and into 
the back of the net.
It was a display of quality 
football, but it was too little, too 
late. The Chippewas’ (1-5) late-
game score was their sole shot 
on goal. The Michigan women’s 
soccer 
team 
had 
already 
notched all six of its goals in a 
6-1 victory Friday evening.
The 
Wolverines 
(4-3) 
dominated possession from the 
opening whistle and used give-
and-go passes to expose holes 
in Central Michigan’s sloppy 
defense. This spurred scoring 
chances for Michigan, who 
finished with 10 shots on goal.
“It’s just something that 
we’re constantly working on, 
and looking to have numbers 
and support around the ball 
and I think we just really got 
on the same page, and it just 
showed,” said Michigan coach 
Jennifer Klein. “I think we 
dictated play right away, and it 
allowed for us to get into a good 
rhythm.”
The Wolverines’ back line 
faced limited pressure due to 
the Chippewas’ slow play and 
failure to attack open space on 
offense.
Just over five minutes into 
the game, senior forward Reilly 
Martin settled the ball at her 
feet in the goal box. Martin 
broke away from her defender 
and found a gap to the right 
before hitting the bottom left 
corner to put her team up 1-0. 
This was the opening of the 
floodgates.
Then the flood came full 
force, starting in the 14th 
minute 
with 
sophomore 

midfielders Nicki Hernandez 
and 
Sarah 
Stratigakis. 
Hernandez kicked a pass into 
a crowded box to Stratigakis, 
who sent the ball past the 
keeper into the bottom right 
corner.
Less than a minute later, 
Hernandez 
came 
back 
in 
action. But this time, she found 
the netting herself — off a ball 
from Martin — to put Michigan 
up 3-0.
The 
flood 
continued 
throughout the first half as 
Martin blasted one into the top 
right corner in the 17th minute 
for her second goal of the night, 
off a pass from Hernandez. 
And then in the 26th minute, 
freshman 
forward 
Sammi 
Atterbury 
scored 
following 
a smart through ball from 
freshman midfielder Raleigh 
Loughman.
The second half was much 
less eventful for the Wolverines. 
They continued to control the 
game but only scored once, 
in the 64th minute, when 
Stratigakis delivered a through 
ball to Hernandez who blasted 
one off the keeper’s hands and 
into the twine to finish with 
a stellar two goals and two 
assists.
“Overall just really happy 
with the result that we were 
able to get, for our last game 
of 
non-conference,” 
Klein 
said. “You know, it’s been a 
journey and a process for our 
non-conference games and we 
really felt like we learned a lot 
and we put ourselves in good 
position heading into Big Ten.”
Michigan’s sizable victory 
will 
certainly 
serve 
as 
a 
confidence booster, but for a 
team heading into conference 
play just barely holding a 
winning record, there is always 
room for improvement.
And Klein is fixated on 
shutting out opponents as an 
area to work on.
“I was disappointed in giving 
up a goal,” Klein said. “Our 
focus going into the game was 
to have a clean sheet.”

Michigan survives second half collapse vs. WMU

As the ball was played out 
from a crowded midfield to 
Jack Hallahan on the wing, 
a collective fervor resonated 
throughout 
the 
stadium. 
Spectators 
stood 
up 
in 
anticipation. All eyes were 
glued on the movements of 
the 
junior 
forward. 
After 
cutting 
back 
and 
getting 
the ball onto 
his right foot, 
Hallahan 
whipped 
a 
cross 
into 
the box. And 
there to meet 
it was senior 
midfielder 
Ivo 
Cerda, 
who sent the 
perfectly 
placed ball into the net.

“Thank God it went in,” 
Cerda said. “After that it was 
just madness.”
The 
goal 
clinched 
a 
3-2 overtime win for the 
Wolverines 
(3-1-0) 
over 
in-state 
rival 
Western 
Michigan 
(1-4). 
The 
pandemonium 
that 
ensued 
within 
the 
Michigan 
Soccer Stadium, as both the 
Michigan players and the 
student section stormed the 
field, can be summed as Cerda 
said — madness.
“We don’t win that game 
without 
the 
fans,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Chaka 
Daley. “At the end of the 
day, you don’t find a way to 
win those games if you don’t 
have the tremendous support 
of the Michigan Ultras, the 
Michigan student body and 
our local community.”
A game which ended up 
being highly contested in 
the end was far from it in the 
first half. The Wolverines 
dominated, both offensively 
and defensively.
Sophomore forward Umar 
Farouk 
Osman 
caused 
all 
sorts of problems for the 

Bronco defense, using his 
speed to his advantage down 
the wings. Within 14 minutes, 
Osman was already on the 
scoresheet.
Michigan missed several 
opportunities in the first half 
to extend its lead though. 
Osman and fellow Ghanan 
native, 
sophomore 
striker 
Mohammed Zakyi, combined 
multiple times in the first 
half to no avail, 
as their final few 
touches let them 
down.
Fortunately 
for 
the 
Wolverines, the 
defense led by 
senior 
Daniel 
Mukuna 
and 
sophomore 
Jackson 
Ragen 
kept 
things 
tight at the back 
despite 
Western 
Michigan 
continually 
lofting 
balls 
into the box. Ragen even 
capitalized on a set piece to 
double Michigan’s lead early 
in the second half.
But as the game grew more 
chippy, the pace and quality of 
the Wolverines’ play seemed 

to 
subside 
substantially. 
The Broncos clawed their 
way back into the game as 
a result. The breakthrough 
came in the 72nd minute as a 
ball was played in behind the 
Michigan defense and slotted 
past 
charging 
sophomore 
goalkeeper Henry Mashburn.
With 
the 
momentum 
clearly having shifted, the 
Broncos scored again within 
10 minutes to 
tie the game at 
2-2.
“They 
just 
put the ball up 
and it’s tough 
when you face 
50 balls inside 
the 
box,” 
Cerda 
said. 
“It’s not easy. 
Our back four 
did very well 
but some dip 
in concentration and focus 
let in the first goal and after 
that went in they had the 
momentum. They say 2-0 is 
the most dangerous lead in 
soccer.”
What 
looked 
like 
a 
comfortable outing for the 
Wolverines was no longer 

that. And yet, a second yellow 
card administered to Western 
Michigan 
defender 
Ben 
Thornton in the dying embers 
of regulation gave Michigan a 
bit of confidence entering the 
overtime period.
That 
confidence 
was 
evident as the Wolverines once 
again asserted themselves. 
Their precise passing moves 
from the first half were again 
on display, and 
it wasn’t long 
before 
they 
paid off. After a 
whirlwind of a 
game, Michigan 
fans went home 
happy.
“These 
things happen,” 
Daley 
said. 
“It’s 
college 
soccer. 
From 
our perspective 
we played well for 75 minutes 
and had a little lull, but after 
that, everything was good. 
We rallied the troops in 
overtime and they took care 
of business. Certainly from 
our perspective, finding a 
way to win is more important 
than dropping the game.”

What you missed when you left at halftime

It didn’t take long for the 
Michigan 
football 
team 
to 
dominate Western Michigan. 
After a punt on the game’s 
opening drive, the Wolverines 
racked up five consecutive 
touchdowns to 
put the Bron-
cos well away 
by halftime.
But you had 
probably 
left 
by then.
It 
was 
already a blow-
out. 
Western 
Michigan was 
already 
over-
matched. And 
every 
take-
away from Saturday’s game 
does come with the caveat of 
a weak opponent. But the sec-
ond half did provide a worth-
while look at Michigan’s youth 
and depth. So here’s what you 
missed during your nap.
Patterson’s dime
Midway through the third 
quarter, 
junior 
quarterback 
Shea Patterson threaded the 
needle for his third touchdown 
pass of the day — a throw that 
required touch, zip and just 
enough loft to hit sophomore 
receiver 
Donovan 
Peoples-
Jones in the corner of the end-
zone. It was a “high level” play 
according to Jim Harbaugh.
“To change the channel and 
go to the corner and throw it 
to Donovan, make that split-
second decision and make that 
accurate of a throw, I mean, 
you’re really seeing things 
well,” Harbaugh said.
It was the exclamation point 
of a solid home debut for Patter-
son. He didn’t need to do much 
while the Wolverines’ running 
game dominated, but Patterson 
was nonetheless accurate and 
poised throughout, completing 
12 of 17 passes.
He even got involved on the 
ground, too. Reminiscent of his 
Ole Miss days, Patterson ran 
the option to perfection, keep-
ing the ball for 16 yards during 
his final drive of the afternoon. 

Running isn’t Patterson’s bread 
and butter, but it was still a 
reminder to future opposing 
defenses to stay honest.
McCaffery, 
Wilson 
lead 
TD drive
Just 
as 
he 
did 
against 
Notre Dame, Dylan McCaf-
fery replaced Patterson in the 
fourth 
quarter. 
Saturday’s 
cir-
cumstances were 
far easier for the 
redshirt 
fresh-
man, though.
Up 
42-0, 
McCaffery’s 
job was simple: 
handoff to junior 
Tru Wilson. And 
Wilson 
— 
hav-
ing recently been 
announced as the 
team’s 
third-string 
running 
back — took advantage with 54 
yards on six carries.
But McCaffery did get his 
first career touchdown pass 
when he hit sophomore Jake 
McCurry on an out-route for 
18-yard score.
Another 
week, 
another 
promising effort from Michi-
gan’s heir apparent.
“Thought Dylan, he’s got a 
real coolness about him when 
he’s out there playing. See it 
on the sideline when I’m call-

ing the plays,” Harbaugh said. 
“Watching him execute, it was 
good.”
On the lines
First, 
both 
sophomore 
Aubrey Solomon and senior 
Lawrence 
Marshall 
missed 
Saturday’s game with undis-
closed injuries.
“They’re 
both out work-
ing 
through 
something this 
week,” 
Har-
baugh 
said. 
“We’ll see when 
they get back, 
but we should 
get them back, 
sooner 
rather 
than later.”
In 
their 
absences, 
junior Carlo Kemp received 
his first meaningful action 
at defensive tackle, where he 
moved this offseason after 
gaining 15 pounds. Fifth-year 
senior Bryan Mone and junior 
Michael Dwumfour also rotat-
ed along the interior — a spot 
that remains unproven and 
thin, although it didn’t look it 
against a shaky Broncos offen-
sive line.
Speaking 
of 
offensive 
lines, Michigan’s was indeed 
improved in both run blocking 

and pass protection. But the 
quality of the opposition mat-
ters again. Given last week’s 
struggles at tackle, redshirt 
freshman James Hudson and 
true freshman Jaylen Mayfield 
were notable substitutions at 
the end of the fourth quarter.
Barring an injury, however, 
the Wolverines’ 
starting 
line 
will likely be the 
same next week.
Harbaugh 
showed 
faith 
in starters Jon 
Runyan, 
Ben 
Bredeson, Cesar 
Ruiz, 
Michael 
Onwenu 
and 
Juwann Bushell-
Beatty 
despite 
struggles against 
the Fighting Irish. It paid off 
Saturday. Over 300 yards rush-
ing and a mostly clean pocket 
for Patterson should bring the 
entire team a needed confi-
dence boost.
“Good to see our young 
offensive linemen get snaps … 
Get a lot of guys out there play-
ing,” Harbaugh said. “I think 74 
players played in the game, and 
did things, too, while they were 
out there. Not just got in the 
game, but acquitted themselves 
well. Lot to build on there.”

Michigan ground game 
dominates the Broncos

It’s been a cycle for a while now.
The Michigan football team (1-1 
overall) plays a good defense, like 
Michigan State, Wisconsin or Ohio 
State, and the Wolverines’ running 
game struggles.
Then Michigan faces off with a 
lesser opponent, like Minnesota, 
Indiana or Rutgers, and all of 
the wrongs are righted, as the 
Wolverines rip off big play after big 
play on the ground.
Saturday’s 
49-3 
win 
over 
Western Michigan was no different.
Senior running back Karan 
Higdon had more than 140 yards 
in the first quarter, the most from 
any Michigan player in one quarter 
since Denard Robinson in 2010. 
He finished with 156 yards and a 
touchdown.
Junior 
running 
back 
Chris 
Evans rushing for 86 yards and two 
touchdowns of his own.
When all was said and done, 
the 
Wolverines 
finished 
with 
308 rushing yards with three 
touchdowns.
“The players, offensively, they’re 
just doing their skill, being confident 
in what they’re doing and executing 
it,” said Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh.
Added Evans: “There was holes 
you could drive a car through, 
and people in there with nobody 
to block, because everybody was 
blocked and taken care of.”
The performance comes one 
week after the Wolverines failed 
to get much going on the ground in 
their loss to No. 8 Notre Dame.
In that matchup, Higdon led the 
team with 72 yards on 21 carries, 
averaging 3.4 yards per carry. Evans, 
meanwhile, had just two carries for 
one yard. You can calculate that 
yards per carry yourself.
“It doesn’t just happen on 
gameday,” Higdon said. “It starts 
with the way we practice. (Running 
backs) coach Jay (Harbaugh) does 

a great job of making sure we bring 
high intensity each and every 
week. I’ve got a great teammate in 
Chris Evans who pushes me each 
and every day. I push him, and we 
expect nothing less from each other.
“So knowing that we have that 
1-2 punch, it’s great for us working 
together alongside our o-line. I 
mean, we can’t expect nothing less 
than to come each and every day 
bringing pressure.”
Saturday’s game was at least a 
little reminiscent of Michigan’s 
dominating win over Minnesota 
last season, though not quite to that 
level.
Higdon and Evans combined for 
391 yards and four touchdowns that 
night.
Evans says he and Higdon talk 
about replicating that production all 
the time.
“Me and Karan were talking 
about, ‘Let’s try to repeat history,’ 
” Evans said. “Just talking, and we 
talk about that a lot, and just being 
able to go back to that time. And that 
day was just amazing for us both.”
The problem, of course, is that 
the Broncos and Golden Gophers 
are not the Fighting Irish or the 
Buckeyes.
It has been a while since the 
Wolverines have been able to accrue 
this kind of yardage in a game that 
really matters.
For that, there may not be a true 
solution, as this much-maligned 
offensive line has had its fair share 
of struggles in the past two seasons. 
Obviously, if you can’t block the good 
teams, then you can’t run against 
the good teams, and there likely isn’t 
going to be some massive personnel 
change that will fix everything. 
Instead, Michigan’s only real 
hope is steady improvement, so 
that by the time the big games come 
around, the car-sized holes remain, 
and Higdon and Evans can bust free.

Patterson shines, offers glimpse of potential

It didn’t hit Shea Patterson until 
he boarded the bus to head to the 
stadium Saturday morning. He 
passed the tailgates he frequented 
as a kid. He recalled conversations 
he used to have with his dad.
The junior had thought about 
what it might be like to play 
quarterback in maize and blue 
since his childhood. He’d spoken 
with his coach, Jim Harbaugh, 
about it since the day he stepped 
on campus. As he got in the bus, 
he realized his circuitous journey 
finally brought him to that desired 
point.
When 
Patterson 
got 
his 
opportunity to run out of the 
tunnel at Michigan Stadium, his 
coach stood back to take in the 
scene. It’s Harbaugh who might 
understand that emotional lure 
better than anyone else.
“He touched the banner — 
looked like he kinda went up 
and did a little reverse dunk,” 
Harbaugh said, with a glowing 
smile. “He had a little sugar on 
the flakes touching the banner. 
… It’s awesome when it means 
something to someone.”
Added Patterson: “When I 
ran out of the tunnel with my 
teammates, I can’t describe that 
feeling. It was kind of emotional, 
but excited as well.”
Saturday, Patterson knew that 
lengthy journey would end with 
him taking the first snap in front 
of 110,000-plus fans in the very 
stands he used to sit in. Perhaps 
he didn’t know that journey would 
end with the most promising 
home debut from a Michigan 
quarterback in recent memory.
Patterson lit up a hapless 
Western 
Michigan 
defense, 
finishing the game with three 
touchdowns in three quarters of 
tidy work, going 12-for-17 for 125 
yards and guiding the Wolverines 
(1-1) to a 49-3 win over the Broncos. 
His 
190.6 
quarterback 
rating 
is the highest from a Michigan 
quarterback since Wilton Speight 
posted a 233.4 rating against 

Maryland on Nov. 5, 2016.
He dazzled all the shiny tools 
that made his transfer to Michigan 
so intriguing in the first place — 
the playmaking with his legs, the 
arm talent to make any throw, the 
poise to command an offense. It 
was all on display Saturday.
For fans and players alike, it was 
a refreshing change.
“We’ve had Jake Rudock here, 
and there’s problems that are 
beyond the scope of a quarterback, 
but in terms of how our offense 
efficiently played and how Shea 
looked, I’d say it’s as good as any 
quarterback I’ve seen here,” said 
fifth-year senior defensive end 
Chase Winovich. “It was weird 
being on the sideline and them just 
scoring touchdowns. I remember 
(junior safety) Josh Metellus … he 
goes, I just remember him sitting 
there looking, he’s like ‘Man, this is 
nice!’ I think the feeling is mutual 
from my half.”
Everything 
in 
this 
game 
comes with the caveat of Western 
Michigan’s weakness — a team 
that allowed 560 total yards and 55 
points last week against Syracuse. 
But it wasn’t necessarily the sheer 
numbers that will leave fans so 
encouraged by Patterson’s play, 
and rather the manner in which 

they came. There were several 
plays he made that no quarterback 
on the last year’s roster would 
have, independent of the Broncos’ 
ineptitude.
On the second drive of the 
game, Patterson rolled to his 
left, throwing across his body 
to a lunging Oliver Martin on 
the sideline for a first down. The 
window was tight, the margin for 
error non-existent. Patterson hit 
him anyway.
“That’s really having a feel, the 
depth perception, the ability to 
throw different types of passes,” 
Harbaugh said. “Drilled it in there 
on the run to his left. That’s check, 
check, check. Plus, plus, plus.”
Late in the first half, Patterson 
stayed 
calm 
in 
the 
pocket, 
dropping a dime over the top of the 
safety into the waiting hands of 
sophomore receiver Nico Collins. 
It was the first touchdown a 
Michigan quarterback has thrown 
to a wide receiver in 364 days. It 
was also the first of three such 
scores on the day.
On 
his 
third 
and 
final 
touchdown, 
Patterson 
floated 
a delicate pass to sophomore 
Donovan Peoples-Jones on third 
and goal from the 5-yard-line. It 
wasn’t his first read on the play, 

Harbaugh said, rather a response 
to the defense reacting to Collins 
coming on a slant underneath. 
Patterson showed the awareness to 
adapt, the skill to place it perfectly.
“The 
throw 
to 
(Peoples-
Jones) probably stands out in 
my mind as the one that really 
puts an exclamation point on it,” 
Harbaugh said.
Stiffer tests will come, no doubt. 
Nobody will confuse Patterson 
with a program savior simply 
because of a game against Western 
Michigan.
But 
from 
the 
players’ 
perspective, their plaudits have 
little to do with the Broncos, 
or anything tangible. It’s in 
his command of the offense, 
his constant poise. They see a 
quarterback who might — just 
might — have the reins of the 
program comfortably in his hands. 
The reins he’s been waiting for 
since childhood.
“The thing about Shea is that he 
just has such a sense of confidence 
that doesn’t come off as cocky, but 
you just know and he knows — this 
is my opinion about it — that he’s 
the man,” Winovich said. “He’s 
the man for the job, and he can get 
the job done. I think for him, it was 
just another day at the office.”
