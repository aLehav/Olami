UNIVERSITY HOUSING
Housing brass
gets creative to
fit largest class
in 'U' history

michigandaily.com

Programs targeted at
fostering community
in converted
Northwood buildings
By MICHELE NAROV
Daily StaffReporter
This year more freshmen than
usual will become acquainted with
the'Bursley-Baits bus.
A large increase in students who
accepted their Fall 2010 admission
left University Housing scrambling
to accommodate a freshman class
larger than ever before and result-
ed in the creation of the North-
wood Houses, the first entirely
new freshmen residence hall in
almost forty years.
University Housing spokes-
man Peter Logan said that despite
algorithms used by the admis-
sions office to estimate class size,
the number was larger than they
originally anticipated by about 400
students. About 240 of those extra
students will be housed on North
Campus this year.
"It created for us a challenge
to accommodate any one of these
freshmen who wanted to be placed
in University housing," he said.

The problem was intensified
because Couzens Hall, traditional-
ly reserved for freshmen students,
is closed for renovations and the
newly completed North Quadran-
gle is only housing upperclassmen.
"Because of the number of bed
spaces unavailable to us, we got
creative and did a lot of brain-
storming within Housing at the
Division of Student Affairs," Logan
said.
He said Housing officials decid-
ed to convert staff offices in Oxford
Housing back to student rooms,
as well as repurposing smaller
lounges in other residence halls,
a strategy used in the past when
the University was at full capacity.
Together, these efforts success-
fully placed 160 residents, leaving
University officials wondering how
to accommodate close to 240 other
students.
"The option that made the most
sense was creating a first-year
community out of three apartment
buildings in Northwood," Logan
said. "So we identified three build-
ings that were adjacent to each
other and basically had them fur-
nished like any residence hall."
He added that most residents
placed in the new housing had
indicated that they wanted to live

Despite a plan to vote on the

Michigan Student Assembly Exec-
utive Board, had opposed voting
on the ban last night, saying that a
vote at the start of the school year
would limit student involvement
in the process.

Provost Hanlon
praises Munson for
encouraging
collaboration
By SUZANNE JACOBS
Daily StaffReporter
University Provost Phil Hanlon
announced last week the reap-
pointment of David Munson Jr.
for a second term as the Robert
J. Vlasic Dean of the College Of
Engineering.
"He's a terrific dean, a really
outstanding leader for the col-
lege," Hanlon said of Munson in
an interview. "I really appreciate
his interest and passion for the
student experience."
Hanlon said in a press release
that Dean Munson's reappoint-
ment review - an extensive look
into the dean's general impact
across the College of Engineering
from the perspective of students,
faculty and staff within the col-
lege - "was almost uniformly
positive."
"Dean Munson's thoughtful
modernization of the UM Engi-
neering Program maintains the

strengths of the Michigan engi-
neering education while evoving
to produce engineers well pre-
pared for the highly competitive
global economy," Hanlon wrote in
the release.
Hanlon said in the press release
that since becoming the Robert
J. Vlasic Dean of Engineering in
2006, Munson has broadened the
scope of undergraduate engineer-
ing education at the University
and has improved the collegial
environment in the College of
Engineering through his "friend-
ly, open-minded and visionary
management style."
Munson said in an interview
that during his time as dean he
has tried to emphasize
"co-curricular programs" and
"experiential learning" for under-
graduates in the College of Engi-
neering. That focus, he said, has
brought about more international
and entrepreneurial programs.
Munson added that he has also
stressed the importance of mul-
tidisciplinary work with depart-
ments outside of the College of
Engineering. Whether in the form
of research collaborations with
the Medical School or course col-
laborations with the Colleges of

National Symposium
will begin in Ann
Arbor on Oct.14
By JENNA SIMARD
For the Daily
On Oct. 14 1960, former Presi-
dent John F. Kennedy used the

steps of the Michigan Union to
lay out his vision for the National
Peace Corps Association.
Now, 50 years later, the Uni-
versity will serve once again as a
launching location, but this time
for Peace Corps anniversary fes-
tivities throughout the country.
The National Peace Corps Asso-
ciation asked the University to
host the symposium because of the

University's ties to the program,
according to John Greisberger, the
University's International Center
Director.
Though Oct.14 is not the official
day of the Peace Corps' establish-
ment, the date was chosen because
of the role Kennedy's speech
played in starting the organiza-
tion, Greisberger said.

MONDAY:
In Other Ivory Towers
Like many faculty mem-
bers, Assistant Prof. of Screen
Arts and Cultures Daniel Her-
bert spent his summer doing
research for a book he pians
to write. But instead of doing
research in archives and on
microfilms, Herbert spent
three weeks touring indepen-
dent video rental stores across
coral America.
While originally from
Farmington Hills, Mich.,
Herbert went to the Univer-
sity of Hew Mexico to get his
undergraduate degree, which
is where he said he realized he
wanted to study film.
"I thought I was going to
be some kind of artist and
anthropologist, and thenI
thought I would take a film
class. I definitely did not want
a straight-laced career," said
Herbert. "Then from the first

minute the instructor came
out and I was so impressed by
him in that class that I decid-
ed that film is the rest of my
life."
While studying at UNM, he
took a job as a video clerk in a
local independent video store
in Albuquerque.
'When I got asked to work
there by the owner, I thought
it was the coolest thing on the
planet," he said.
Herbert said his experience
at the independent video store
exposed him to a wide vari-
ety of non-mainstream film
genres, which later influenced
his career. As an assistant
professor, Herbert focuses on
contemporary cinema.
"5 look at issues of global-
ization and I like to think a
lot about the industry as well
as aesthetics," Herbert said.

"I really like business issues,
so I'm teaching a class this
semester on the film industry.
In some ways what I do now
iso't that different than what
Idid as a video clerk- I mean
it is, but you study film, you
watch movies and you talk
shoot them with people."
Herbert, who eventually
earned his Ph.D. in Critical
Studies at the University of
Southern California, said he
was offered the option to stay
at USC for a post-doctorate
year at the same time he was
offered his position an the
University, but the decision to
come to Ann Arbor was a "no-
brainer."
"I love the facolty. I love
the resources here. I love the
students," Herbert said.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Shooting at Detroit
school places two
students in hospital
An argument that started at a
Detroit high school on the first day
of class led to two students being
shot nearby and a hunt for other
students who might have been
involved, police said yesterday.
The shootings happened about
3:30 p.m. about a block from Mum-
ford High School, just after class-
es ended for the day, police said.
Detroit police spokeswoman Sgt.
Eren Stephens said a 16-year-old
boy was shot in the buttocks and a
14-year-old girl was grazed in the
eyebrow.
Police didn't release the names
of the students, who were taken to
a nearby hospital.
Stephens said the shootings
stemmed from an argument
between the boy and another stu-
dent police believe was the shooter.
Another student also may have
been involved, she said.
Police are questioning a person
of interest but no arrests have been
made, she said.
The district's state-appointed
leader, Robert Bobb, told reporters
at the scene that the good news is
the injuries didn't appear to be seri-
ous.
"The bad news is the shooting
happened at all," Bobb said.
A string of shootings and the
perception of crime has caused
some parents to flee the roughly
78,000-student district for charter,
suburban or private schools.
CHICAGO
Lawsuit underway
regarding Ill carp
The reliability of genetic test-
ing to detect the presence of Asian
carp is the focus of the first full day
of expert testimony in a five-state
lawsuit.
Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio,
Minnesota and Pennsylvania want
a federal judge to close Illinois ship-
ping locks to prevent the invasive
fish from overrunning the Great
Lakes.
The first witness called by the
states yesterday was a biologist who
found traces of Asian carp DNA in
Chicago-area waterways near Lake
Michigan.
David Lodge says the DNA most
likely came from live carp.
Others have suggested the carp
DNA could have been transported
in the ballast water of barges and
so the positive test don't neces-
sarily mean the fish is present.
ELIZABETHTOWN, KY
Corn kernels pop in
field due to weather
A Hardin County farmer said
that some ears among his feed corn
rows popped on the stalk in a phe-
nomenon that agricultural experts
believe is associated with irregular
rainfall and high heat.
Star Mills farmer Patrick Pres-
ton sent a photo of the burst kernels

that look like partially popped pop-
corn to the University of Kentucky
Cooperative Extension Service.
Hardin County Extension agent
Doug Shepherd told The News
Enterprise he's never seen popped
kernels before.
Shepherd said the outer coat
of a kernel can explode from heat
after the ears are pollinated. Tem-
peratures in corn fields can be 10
degrees higher than in the sur-
rounding area as the plants are pro-
ducing energy.
NAIROBI, Kenya
Somali pirates tried
in Kenyan courts
A Kenyan court has convicted
and sentenced seven Somalis
of piracy to five years in jail, a
defense lawyer said yesterday.
A court in the Kenyan port
town of Mombasa found the
Somalis guilty of attacking a Ger-
man naval supply ship in the Gulf
of Aden on March 29 last year,
said Jared Magolo, their lawyer.
He said his clients plan to appeal
the verdict made Monday.
"Even though we believe that
the verdict was not very heavy,
but the conviction was not prop-
er," said Magolo.
The European Union anti-pira-
cy task force said it welcomes the
court's decision.
The "judgment marks an
important step in the coopera-
tion between EU and Kenya in the
repression of acts of piracy and
armed robbery off the coast of
Somalia," said.

War-torn Congo

REZA SHIRMOHAMMADI/AP
The top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan is asking for 2,00 more soldiers in Kabul to help meet the 2011 deadline.
Afghan govt. to regain
security control in'1

NATO troops to
begin transfer of
responsibility
WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S.-
led NATO troops in Afghanistan
should be able to start handing
off responsibility for security to
the Kabul government sometime
next year, Secretary-General
Anders Fogh Rasmussen said
yesterday.
While stopping short of set-
ting a firm deadline, Rasmussen's
public declaration puts the secu-
rity alliance in line with President
Barack Obama's promise to begin
pulling U.S. troops out in July
2011.
But Rasmussen's latest pre-
diction also reflects a growing
realization by NATO that secu-
rity conditions won't dramatically
improve this year, as many hoped.
At a NATO meeting in April, the
secretary-general had said that
handing over responsibility to the
Afghans was a primary goal for
this year.
Some NATO members have
already pulled out of the mission
or plan to do so soon because of a

lack of public support.
NATO members were to meet
in Lisbon, Portugal, in November
to devise a plan for handing off
control to the Afghans, including
a timeline for various provinces
and benchmarks to measure prog-
ress.
Rasmussen said he believes
security conditions have
improved enough so a transition
is possible. However, he said the
precise timing of a drawdown will
depend upon conditions on the
ground.
"We will not leave until we
finish our job," he told reporters
before a meeting with Obama at
the White House. "But it is very
helpful to have this roadmap."
War commanders have been
more reluctant to put a date on
when Afghan troops might take
control. Lt. Gen. Bill Caldwell, the
head of NATO's training mission
in Afghanistan, has said the alli-
ance needs at least another year to
recruit and train enough soldiers
and police officers.
Rasmussen said setting next
year as a goal for beginning to
wind down troop levels does not
conflict with a request by Gen.
David Petraeus, NATO's top com-

mander in Afghanistan, for 2,000
more troops. Rasmussen said
most of the 2,000 troops would be
assigned to train Afghan security
forces, in preparation for NATO's
eventual withdrawal.
"Trainers are the ticket to tran-
sition," he said.
The Pentagon said Tuesday
that the request for 2,000 more
troops is a long-standing require-
ment for more trainers that will
not be filled by U.S. forces.
"NATO will have to determine
how to fill that requirement,"
said Marine Col. Dave Lapan, a
Defense Department spokesman.
NATO has been eager to show
progress in the war. The alli-
ance's top commander in south-
ern Afghanistan, British Maj. Gen.
Nick Carter, said this week that
coalition troops will clear the area
around the key city of Kandahar
by December.
In the meeting with Obama, the
president thanked Rasmussen for
NATO's efforts to promote peace
and stability around the world,
particularly in Afghanistan, the
White House said. Obama and
Rasmussen also discussed goals
for the Nov. 19-20 NATO Summit
in Lisbon.

UN says rape has
become regular
weapon of war
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The
United Nations reported yester-
day that more than 500 systematic
rapes were committed by armed
combatants in eastern Congo since
late July - more than double the
number previously reported - and
accepted partial responsibility for
not protecting citizens.
U.N. Assistant Secretary-Gen-
eral for Peacekeeping Atul Khare
told the U.N. Security Council that
260 more rapes occurred in anoth-
er region of the country, in addi-
tion to 242 rapes earlier reported
in and around Luvungi, a village of
about 2,200 people located a half-
hour drive from a U.N. peacekeep-
ers' camp.
"While the primary responsi-
bility for protection of civilians
lies with the state, its national
army and police force," said Khare,
"clearly, we have also failed. Our
actions were not adequate, result-
ing in acceptable brutalization of
the population of the villages in
the area. We must do better."
The area peacekeeping force,
called MONUSCO, on Sept. 1
launched an operation using 750
troops to back efforts by Congo-
lese security forces to arrest the
perpetrators of the attacks, said
Khare. At least 27 rebels armed
with automatic rifles have surren-
dered and at least four more have
been arrested, he said.
Meanwhile, Khare said, peace-
keepers will undertake more night
patrols, and perform more random
checks on communities. The U.N.
is also looking into ways of pro-
viding peacekeepers with mobile
phones by installing a high fre-
quency radio in Luvungi, he said.
Rape as a weapon of war has
become shockingly commonplace
in eastern Congo, where the gov-
ernment army and U.N. peace-
keepers have failed to defeat the
few thousands rebels responsible
for a protracted conflict fueled by
vast mineral reserves. The United
Nations says at least 8,300 rapes
were reported last year and it is
believed that many more rapes go
unreported.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-
moon in recent days sent Khare
to Congo to investigate why U.N.
peacekeepers didn't learn about at
least 242 mass rapes in the Luvun-
gi area from July 30 to Aug. 4 until
Aug. 12, when it was informed by
the International Medical Corps
which was treating many of the

victims.
The additional sexual attacks,
in an area called Uvira and other
regions of North and South Kivu,
came to light during Khare's
trip. He told council members he
learned of 74 cases of sexual vio-
lence, including against 21 minors
- all girls between the ages of 7
and 15 - and six men, in a village
called Miki, in South Kivu. All the
women in another village, Kiluma,
may have been systematically
raped, he said.
Khare said in a community
called Katalukulu, 10 women
were raped by Congolese soldiers,
which he said must "maintain a
much higher standard of disci-
pline, good behavior and conduct,
and observance of human rights."
The undersecretary-general
called for prosecution of Rwandan
rebel FDLR and Congolese Mai-
Mai rebels blamed for many of the
attacks and U.N. sanctions against
their leaders.
U.N. envoy Margot Wallstrom,
expressed her alarm over the
increase in reported rapes, saying
they show "a broader pattern of
widespread and systematic rape
and pillage." A senior member of
Wallstrom's staff accompanied
Khare on his recenttrip.
"It is evidentthatrape is increas-
ingly selected as the "weapon of
choice in Eastern DRC, with num-
bers reaching endemic propor-
tions," shetoldthesecuritycouncil.
"The sad reality is that incidents of
rape have become so commonplace
that they do not trigger our most
urgent interventions."
Wallstrom last month warned
leaders of rebel groups that they
could be prosecuted by the Inter-
national Criminal Court because
widespread and systemic sexual
violence can constitute war crimes
and crimes against humanity.
Congo's permanent represen-
tative to the U.N., Ileka Atoki,
expressed his "deep disgust" with
the mass rapes and thanked the
security council for investigating
the attacks.
"These heinous acts, that have
become a weapon of war, are one
more episode of the unspeakable
suffering that the people of Congo
have been plunged for more than
a decade now," Atoki told council
members.
Atoki told the council that his
country would continue to need
international help to combat the
attacks, characterizing national
police sources as "pathetic." But
international backing for efforts to
end the protracted conflictin east-
ern Congo are just as important,
he said.

Tape of alleged attempted
NY temple bomber shown

Alleged mastermind
planned to attack
synagogues, planes
NEW YORK (AP) - A video-
tape shows the alleged master-
mind of a plot to attack New
York synagogues and shoot
down military planes prac-
ticing with a shoulder mis-
sile launcher and praying two
weeks before the planned
attack.
The tape played for a jury
yesterday at the federal trial
of James Cromitie and three
other men capture a paid FBI
informant giving him a crash
course in a bugged warehouse
in Connecticut - part of an
elaborate sting in 2009.
"This is the handle, OK?"
the informant, Shahed Hus-
sain, tells Cromitie as he
holds the weapon on his
shoulder.
He instructs Cronfitie,
"Once we shoot it, then we
destroy the thing" by throw-
ing it in the Hudson River.
Cromitie responds that
learning to shoot seemed
"easy." However, he adds, "I
wish you had a blank, so we
could take a shot."
He can be heard chuck-
ling. at times and seen rub-
bing his hands together. At
end of the tape, Cromitie, two
of his alleged cohorts and the
informant bow their heads in
prayer.
Cromitie, 43, Onta Wil-
liams, 34, David Williams, 29,
and Laguerre Payen, 28, have
pleaded not guilty to charges
of conspiracy to use weap-
ons of mass destruction and
conspiracy to acquire and use
anti-aircraft missiles to kill
U.S. officers and employees.
Prosecutors in federal court
in Manhattan allege that with
Hussain's encouragement,
Cromitie hatched the scheme
to blow up the synagogues in
the Bronx with remote-con-
trolled bombs. They say the
men also also wanted to shoot
down planes at the Air Nation-
al Guard base in Newburgh,
N.Y., about 50 miles north of

New York City.
Agents arrested the men in
2009 after they planted the
devices - fakes supplied by the
FBI - in the Bronx while under
heavy surveillance.
Hussain met Cromitie in 2008

after being sent by the FBI to
infiltrate a Newburgh mosque.
After that, the 53-year-old Paki-
stani immigrant helped make
hundreds of hours of video and
audio tapes that are the center-
piece of the case.

A summer cheat sheet
News you need to know to get through the semester
As summer draws to a close, students are forced to let go
of carefree attitudes and return to an academic mindset.
Students who spent the summer working, interning or
just playing in the sun must now return to the daily grind of lec-
tures, recitations and lengthy papers written on the fly the night
before they're due. But it's been quite a busy summer from the
news media's perspective. So we at The Michigan Daily thought
we'd spare you the chore of reviewing the archives by catching you
up on the summer's biggest stories and drawing your attention to

Paying more for parking

some stories to watch as they dev
The summer's most worrisome national
headline was the massive oil spill in the Gulf
of Mexico. In April, a BP oil rig exploded,
leaving an underwater well open to spill
hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil into
the Gulf each day for months. Though the
well was capped and covered in cement in
July, the Gulf is still a mess of oil that BP has
pledged to clean up.
Some things have changed little over the
summer. Though President Barack Obama
declared an official end to combat opera-
tions in Iraq last week, our nation's military
presence in Iraq is far from over. And the
economy - both across the nation and here
in Michigan - is still pretty awful.
Close to home, the news has been preoc-
cupied with the approaching November
elections. August primary elections placed
Lansing Mayor Virg Bernero, a Democrat,
against Republican Rick Snyder, an Ann
Arbor businessman, in the running to be
Michigan's next governor. The race prom-
ises to be contentious. Neither candidate
is particularly well-known. And though
Michigan typically votes blue, the state of
the economy during Democratic Governor
Jennifer Granholm's term may lead voters to
check Snyder's name on the ballot.
Here in Ann Arbor, the August primary
elections almost always indicate the win-
ner of the November ballot- Democratic
candidates rarely face Republican chal-
lengers. True to form, Mayor John Heiftje
will retain his job after defeating challeng-
er Patricia Lesko in the Democratic prima-
ry. And only one seat on the City Council
has a Republican contender.

At the University, it was announced
this summer that the campus-wide smok-
ing ban, scheduled to take full effect in
July 2011, would be enforced at Michi-
gan Stadium this season. The University
also completed its investigation of allega-
tions of NCAA rules violations and awaits
the decision of the NCAA Committee on
Infractions regarding the University's self-
imposed sanctions.
And the University's Board of Regents
has, as usual, again raised tuition. The
1.5-percent increase for in-state students
and 3-percent increase for out-of-state stu-
dents constituted the lowest increase Uni-
versity students and their families have
seen in years. The regents' vote, unusually,
was not unanimous. Two regents out of the
eight that sit on the board voted against the
increase. But these facts are cold comfort to
students who struggle to pay ever-increas-
ing and unreasonable tuition.
In other areas, there is no certainty. Foot-
ball fans anxiously debate the state of the
Michigan football team. Students wait to see,
if Chris Armstrong, president of the Michi-
gan Student Assembly, can lead his party,
MForward, to-make MSA relevant and use-
ful again after years of scandal and disaster.
Over the course of the semester, the
Daily will track the progress of these and
other topics, providing you with accu-
rate, honest news coverage and thought-
ful editorials. But your opinion matters,
too. Express your opinion in letters to the
editor and viewpoints. The Daily's opinion
page is a place for discussion, but that only
works if students speak up.

bile we are were all laying
on the beach on summer
vacation, Ann Arbor intro-
duced zoned resi-
dential parking in
the neighborhoods
immediately north'
of Huron Street. In
June, City Coun-
cil agreed to the
action to counter
an expected influx 3
of cars from the
460 students living PATRICK
in the new North gMAHEN
Quad. As a result,
I dutifully trudged
down to the City
Service Building, handed over $50
for a year's parking, and received a
flimsy plastic decal to prevent Trian-
gle Towing from dumping my Dodge
Neon in an impound lot.
At first I was annoyed to have to
pay for street parking after park-
ing for free in that neighborhood for
six years. But after some thought,
I changed my mind. Ann Arbor
deserves props for putting a price
on its overused public asset of street
parking in residential neighborhoods.
In fact, one major problem that I
have with the new policy is that the
city is not charging nearly enough.
Also, the scheme unfairly subsidizes
the ability of residents like me to park
their cars on city streets at the expense
of the needs of commuters and student
residents of North Quad.
The fix to these problems is quite
straightforward: Create an annual auc-
tion for neighborhood parking permits.
This step would create a fair market
rate for parking, ease the city's chronic
parking problems and cut automobile
congestion.In additionAnnArborwill
expand its revenue base, increase eco-
nomic efficiency and encourage devel-
opment of environmentally friendly
forms of transport.
The city's current parking problem
is a simple Economics 101 homework
exercise. Free on-street parking in

many neighborhoods close to cam-
pus makes demand exceed supply -
which is the reason it's impossible to
find a parking place duringthe dayon
streets in the Old Fourth Ward neigh-
borhood around Catherine, Law-
rence and East Kingsley.
Putting a price on parking will
lower the quantity demanded. If
forced to pay more, citizens will re-
evaluate their options. Suddenly
car-pooling, the bus or living closer
to town might look more attractive
than street parking. This in turn will
reduce externalities associated with
free street parking - heavy traffic,
pollution and excess wear and tear
on roads, all of which create a dragon
the local economy.
But the problem is finding a proper
way to set a price on parking. The cur-
rent neighborhood system falls short
for two reasons. First, the city vastly
under prices parking. In the Old Fourth
Ward, private parking spaces adver-
tised onCraigslistoverthesummerran
from $80 to $100 per month, roughly
20 times greater than the current price
of residential parkingpermits.
Second, the current residential
parking system unfairly subsidizes
car-owning residents in the neigh-
borhood at the expense of non-car
owners and others who might wish
to park - notably commuters and the
students living in North Quad, who
live within 100 feet of the Old Fourth
Ward across Huron Road.
Auctions would solve these prob-
lems and inequalities by forcing pro-
spective parkers to decide how much
they value parking and creating a
free parking market. Divide the city
neighborhoods near central campus
into distinct parking zones to reflect
differing levels of desirability. The
seven current residential parking
zones could serve as a basis for these
divisions. Once a year, anyone who
wants the right to permanent street
parking on weekdays submits a bid to
park for the next year in the zone of
their choice.

For example, let's say we have
a yearly auction for the approxi-
mately 600 spaces that make up the
Old Fourth Ward and North Central
neighborhoods (yes, I counted them).
If 1,000 people bid, the top 600 bids
get parking, and the yearly rate is set
at the price of the 600th bid. A lottery
could break ties if necessary. The city
could also issue exemptions for dis-
abled drivers.
Parking auction
would create
revenue for city.
The auction would also cre-
ate significant yearly revenue. For
example, a reasonable back-of-the
envelope estimate of the minimum
winning bid might be $1080 (at $90
per month). That means that the
Fourth Ward alone would generate
roughly $650,000 in additional annu-
al revenue for Ann Arbor.
The city could use these proceeds
to create a permanent street-repair
fund and reduce the need to ask
voters for special funds every sev-
eral years. Perhaps it could boost the
regional Ann Arbor Transit Author-
ity's budget to improve mass transit
links like the bus routes between Ann
Arbor and Ypsilanti that are perenni-
ally under threat of elimination. Or
the city could cut property taxes.
But whatever the city does with
the extra revenues, Ann Arbor can
burnish its reputation as an environ-
mental leader, improve its revenue
situation and stop discriminating
against students by making coddled
residents like me pay the true value
of parking. I

Regional rapid transit isn't exactly the sexiest
topic to bring up at party. (I have found that few
policy debates actually help me "bring sexy back"
on a typical Friday night). But with the Aug. 2
announcement that the Obama administration
will begin an environmental impact study on a
light rail on Woodward Avenue in Detroit, I have
a hard time containing my excitement.
The environmental impact study almost
assures that not only will construction begin
relatively soon, but there will also be federal
support to match the private donations already
collected for the project. This is an incredibly
large and tangible step that is satisfying to
those of us who have hoped for rapid transit in
the Metro Detroit area but have been left only
with empty promises. We will no longer be
left with the People Mover, an overly glorified
monorail that goes in a circle, or a bus system
that takes an hour and half to go four miles.
But the light rail isn't without obstacles.
Even with the combined public-private dol-
lars, the backers don't have enough money to
actually make the light rail regional. As of the
current plan, the rail begins in Hart Plaza in
downtown Detroit and ends at the vacant state
fair grounds at 8 Mile and Woodward. The pre-
vious regional light rail project extended all
the way to11 Mile and Woodward.
While it's fairly simple to understand that
without more funds there can be no more
expansion to the rail, this is an all too beaten
path for those from Metro Detroit. Too many
times have good ideas seemed to dwindle
and die in the graveyard that is the 8 Mile
divide. Too little cooperation and compromise
between Detroit's city leaders and suburban
officials has left the region trailing behind
every other metropolitan area. Transit is no
exception. Simply look at the fact there are
two different bus systems that run in Metro-
Detroit: Detroit Department of Transporta-
tion, the Detroit city bus system, and Suburban
Mobility Authority for Regional Transpor-
tation - more commonly known as SMART
- which is the suburban system. These exist

separately not due to any sort of financial, legal
or rational restriction, but because of purely
cultural divides.
Some contend that the plan must start some-
where and that this is as good as it gets at the
moment. However, as John Hertel, general
manager of SMART, explained a non-regional
light rail "doesn't maximize whatgood it could
do for Detroit...Whenyou'retalkingabout$500
million to go the extra miles, its not a whole lot
of money, but it's a gigantic leap for the region
to go that extra three miles," according to an
Aug. 11 article in Crain's Detroit Business.
There is a solution that could possibly fix
both the financial and cultural problems plagu-
ing this project - A Regional Transit Author-
ity. An RTA would not only commit itself as a
source for securing funding to extend the light
rail to suburban cities like Royal Oak and Troy,
but it would also force Detroit and its suburbs
to begin a foundation of sustainable regional
cooperation. In 2000, Michigan had put a plan
in motion to create the Detroit Area Regional
Transit Authority. Unfortunately, a judge
ruled that the plan overstepped its authority
in 2003. More recently, there have been bills in
the Michigan State House to create a new RTA
to serve these functions, but opponents inside
and outside Detroit's city limits have since
defeated these plans.
Regional cooperation with regards to transit
is the key to a revitalized Metro Detroit, as well
as a revitalized Michigan. This is true not only
because it pools resources and funds, allowing
for greater efficiency at a lower cost, but also
because transit spurs business growth. With
more business growth, students, who educate
themselves in Michigan but then leave for jobs
in other cities, may now find new economic
opportunities in the state. It's sad to realize that
due to the region's prideful yet misplaced self
interest, the Metro Detroit area is losing out on
a wonderful opportunity to connect itself, both
physically, economically and culturally.

When I was little, the only
thing that could pull me
out of my Power Ranger
suit was my fishing
gear. Since then
my priorities have
swung in a slightly
more academic
direction, but fish-
ing still maintains
a close second.
That's why I was V
devastated to hear
that the worst oil JOE
spill in the history SUGIYAMA
of the Midwest
occurred in my
home state.
Late in July, a pipe belonging to
Enbridge Energy Partners spewed
out nearly one million gallons of oil
into Michigan's Kalamazoo River.
Since the incident, Enbridge - under
the supervision of the Environmen-
tal Protection Agency - has gone
through painstaking efforts to rid the
river of its slip-up.
Although the Kalamazoo River
still remains uncharted territory to
me, all Michigan rivers are similar in
that they are without a doubt some-
one's favorite place to fish, hunt, walk
by or float down. I know for a fact if
Enbridge Energy had their little inci-
dent in one of my favorite rivers, I
would be out for blood.
Now Enbridge is being hit financial-
ly by the EPA, who, under the Com-
prehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act, will
hold Enbridge entirely financially
responsible for the clean-up. They're
also being hit on Wall Street, where
their stock plummeted - and hasn't
since recovered - following the spill

in the Kalamazoo River. But I feel that
the fiscal damage done to the compa-
nies and those directly responsible
for the disaster is not punishment
enough. I feel that those who are real-
ly to blame, whether it be an inspector
of a pipe or the president of the com-
pany - namely, Enbridge Energy CEO
Patrick D. Daniel - should face the
stark reality of going to trial with the
risk of jail time.
You might be reading this and
thinking how ridiculous it seems to
imprison someone for an uninten-
tional offense, but I believe that it's
warranted. Think about it this way:
First degree murder, vehicular man-
slaughter and animal cruelty are all
crimes punishable by time in prison.
Although first degree murder is pre-
meditated and vehicular manslaugh-
ter is unintentional, they each achieve
the same final result. That's why
vehicular manslaughter is punish-
able by time in prison. No matter how
you look at it, someone convicted of it
caused the death of another person.
I propose that a similar line of logic
be used with animal cruelty and the
environmental devastation caused by
Enbridge Energy, because no matter
how you look at it, an entire ecosystem
has been devastated and thousands of
flora and fauna are now dead because
of the negligence of Enbridge Energy.
Sound extreme? I completely agree
that the limb I'm standing on is about
to snap, but something must be done
to stop these disasters from occurring.
If there was some possibility of doing
time for being negligent with the envi-
ronment, you can bet that CEOs of
oil companies - and plenty of other
companies for that matter - would be
a bit more adamant that their inspec-

tors actually inspect closely and their
operators operate diligently.
Deterents like jail
time are necessary
to prevent oil spills.
There have to be ultimatums con-
cerning these disasters because our
current system, which most of the
time is no system at all, isn't work-
ing. And when the nonexistent sys-
tem breaks down, it's not the CEOs
and workers who are facing the
consequences of their carelessness;
it's the 200-year-old white oak that
chokes on the poisonous crude that's
saturated the earth, it's the blackened
Canadian goose and her chicks who
struggle to paddle through a thick
layer of sludge and it's the little boy
who's fishing hole has now become a
toxic dump.
If you're not a fisherman or have
never taken time to enjoy any of the
great rivers of Michigan, you might
still be struggling to invest fully in
my proposal, but taking a 15-minute
trip down Ann Arbor's Huron River
Drive will make my argument clear.
These are places that must be pro-
tected from avoidable mistakes and
we can prevent these mistakes by set-
ting a precedent that puts culprits of
these crimes against nature on trial
and possibly in prison.

Sufjan's latest delights

Lengthy EP proves
welcome addition to
folkster's catalogue
By ARIELLE SPECINER
Daily Arts Writer
Sufjan Stevens once announced
he would pen an album about each
of the fifty states. His latest EP, All
Delighted People, may have finally
put to rest his fans' long-delayed
expectations for
that project's com-
pletion. Though
Stevens has prob- $ufjan
ably been givingus
false hope all these
years,All Delighted All Delighted
People won't put People
a damper on his Asthmatic Kitty
fans' days.
Although the
60-minute, eight-song EP doesn't
stay in Stevens's "usual" confines
of upbeat, jovial sound, it brings the
listener to another dimension of his
abilities as an artist. While the EP
holds lengthy songs, even one that
spans more than 17 minutes, listen-
ers' attention never scurries. Each
song displays Stevens's aptitude as
a musical artist as he tries out new
sounds.
On the final track, "Djohari-
ah," a tribute to his sister, Stevens
experiments with sounds ranging
from blues-y trumpets and electric
guitar chords to choral hums and
electronic beats. All of these out-of-
comfort-zone experimental sounds
build to Stevens's soft voice chim-
ing in toward the end. "Djohariah"
could very well stand alone as its
own EP. With echoes of a chorus
blending in with a lengthy guitar
jam that climaxes into a colliding
sound, there is enough diversity
here to make up several different
songs.
All Delighted People poses the
question: Where does Stevens's
range end? He creates such an unex-
pected sound with this EP, it throws
the listener off as to what will come

it's time to get
artistic again

By JAMIE BLOCK
ManagingArts Editor
Festifall is here, and that means
one of two things, depending on
your outlook: It could mean the
Diag has become an intraversable
morass with strangers blocking
all major intersections, free candy
flying at your head and enough
science-fair boards to give you a
middle school flashback. But from
where I'm standing, Festifall is a
world of opportunities, especially
arts opportunities. And you owe
it to yourself to get involved if you
have any interest whatsoever.
While students can elect to fill
creative expression requirements,
the University doesn't mandate
that we take arts classes, which
is definitely for the better. If you
put someone in an arts class who
doesn't want to be there, they'll
bring everyone down. But while
you don't have to get involved in
the arts, that doesn't mean you
shouldn't. You really really should,
for realsies. There are so many arts
groups on campus showing them-
selves off on the Diag today that
you're almost guaranteed to find
something you'll like. And trust me,
it's worth the time to get involved,
even if you're a freshman taking
college-level classes for the first
time and intimidated by the time
pressure. Nay, especially if you fit
that description.
In my freshman year, one of
my East Quad neighbors recom-
mended that I join the Glee Club
after hearing choir music emanat-
ing from my speakers. When I first
auditioned, Iwas super excited, and
then ecstatic to actually be allowed
to join the group. During the first
few weeks, I kept leaving my dorm

way earlier than needed and got to
rehearsal before anyone else, just
because I couldn't wait to be sing-
ing with the dudes. Over time, my
departures got later and later, and
the time commitment wore on me.
The workload of my classes was
picking up and rehearsals were
at night. Nights are for screwing
around on the Internet, or, if you're
my parents, homework.
But each time I got to rehears-
al, I forgot any misgivings about
joining Glee Club. As soon as that
first piano key was struck to begin
warm-ups, I was in a whole dif-
ferent mindset. And that's the
influence of the arts. Whatever is

stressing you out - and believe me
newbies, many things will stress
you out - doing something artistic
you really care about can make it
all go away, if only for a short while.
Whether you want to break dance
or hip-hop dance or ballet dance or
contemporary dance or ice dance
or ice carve or sing a cappella or
sing classical or act in plays or act
in musicals or knit, something at

Stevens's attention-grabbing tone a similar sound. Each track has
with swells of soft, windblown cho- such range and variety within itself
ral harmonies. Stevens takes cues (instrumentally), yet collectively
from folk princess Joanna Newsom the EP leaves listeners sleepy.

Stevens also incorporates inspi-
ration from Simon and Garfunkel.
The EP's title track pays homage to
one of the duo's most famous tracks,
"Sounds of Silence," through sound
and lyric. Simon and Garfunkel's
own lyrics ("And the people bowed
and prayed / To the neon god they
made") intermingle with his own
words, "And what difference does it
make?/Ilove you so much anyway."
All Delighted People is a rolling
wave of out-of-the blue sounds and
choral beauty intertwined with
experimental self-achievements
and elegant vocals. The EP may
confuse fans, as it is possibly a pre-
view of what Stevens's ever-chang-
ing sound will become. But if this
is just a taste, bring on the whole
platter.

achete' slices for slicing's sake"

Danny Trejo has a thing for
blades in wild and violent
action flick
By TIMOTHY RABB
DailyArts Writer
Most of us would likely agree the most
absurd entries in the modern "B-movie" tra-
dition are those pretending
to be so much more than *
what their shallow content
suggests. Critics have been M
complaining for years that
films that once bore the At Quality 16
definitive marks of B-movie- and Rave
dom - namely, shamelessly 20th Century Fox
shoddy production values -
have undergone a grotesque
transformation into the well funded, polished
blockbuster drivel of today.
Fortunately, a timely double feature titled
"Grindhouse" (directed by Quentin Tarantino
and Robert Rodriguez) was precisely the film
fans of a violent, blood-spattered exploita-
tion film genre had been waiting for. It set in
motion a new wave of appreciation for a gritty
form of entertainment, a medium that seemed

lost when mainstream Hollywood reinvented
it for monetary gain. Rest assured the true
B-movies of yesterday are back with a ven-
geance, particularly if Machete Cortez (Danny
Trejo, "Con Air") has anything to say about it.
"Machete" is a politically fueled thriller
about an ex-Federale whose penchant for
sharp objects and brutal manner of dealing
with evil men will have right-wing moralists
and immigration officials talking for the next
decade, and rightly so. Machete has stunning
pros and crippling cons, but throughout all the
chaos, it never once gives us the impression
that it takes itself seriously; for that alone, it
deserves a measure of our approval.
As for any perceived political or racial moti-
vations, there are none in reality. It's simply
the good old Tarantino formula appropriated
by Rodriguez: Take an exploited demograph-
ic, give them omnipotent strength, turn them

A ballet biopic to make you bawl

By CARLY STEINBERGER
DailyArts Writer
Although at times rivet-
ing, "Mao's Last Dancer" is
riddled with
sentimental,
gratuitously
melodramatic s
moments. The
story alone is Danw&
what makes At the
the movie tol- Michigan
erable, coun- Godwyn
terbalancing
the over-the-
top artistic vision.
"Mao's Last Dancer" is the
story of Li Cunxin, a Chinese
ballet dancer with peasant roots
who receives the opportunity to
dance in America in the 1980s.
-The film is adapted from Li's
autobiography and directed
by Bruce Beresford ("Driving
Miss Daisy"): Upon his arrival
in Houston, Li wishes to main-
tain his Maoist beliefs, but he
quickly and happily gets sucked
into an American lifestyle of
liberal spending and free atti-
tude. Throughout the rest of the
film, Li struggles to find a bal-
ance between these two distinct
worlds.

There's no denying that
"Dancer" is entertaining, as
it's a recreation of a very com-
pelling story. The film does an
especially good job at juxtapos-
ing '80s China and '80s Texas.
The dancing in the film is also
quite beautiful; it seizes audi-
ences and transports them to a
different kind of theater, mak-
ing them feel like they're watch-
ing a real ballet.
Newcomer Chi Cao does a
convincing job of playing Li. A
leader at the Birmingham Royal
Ballet Company, Cao dances
the part of Li with elegance.
He even manages to deliver a
solid performance outside of
the dancing, believable as the
naive, abashed Chinese peasant
experiencing the culture of the
United States for the first time.
But along with the intrigue,
the film has a few too many
senselessly sappy moments.
When Li dances in front of an
audience in Houston for the first
time, he freezes up just as he's
about to begin, and has a dra-
matic flashback to his childhood
in China that's obviously trying
to evoke an emotional reaction.
This moment, like many others
in the movie, simply feels too

contrived.
The film begs its viewers to
tear up. Take the moment near
the end when Li's parents come
to America to see their son per-
form professionally for the first
time. After he finishes danc-
ing, his parents are escorted
on stage, whereupon the family
cries incessantly and Li collaps-
Culture clash
and crying
abound in
'Last Dancer'
es to the ground. Regardless
of whether this moment was
included in Li's autobiography,
it should have been omitted or
portrayed in a different man-
ner in the film. As presented,
it feels grossly affected and
schmaltzy.
"Mao's Last Dancer" is worth
at least one viewing; Li Cunxin's
true story definitely holds atten-
tion. But after that, one may find
it too corny to bear.

'Campus P.D.' tones down the
debauchery with realistic look
at college policing
By JAMIE BLOCK
ManagingArts Editor
With the obligatory girl-on-girl kiss, scream-
ing bikini-clad party-goers and wasted bros, the
opening theme for G4's "Cam-
pus P.D." doesn't bode well for ***
the rest of the show. But then,
against all odds, the program Campus P.D.
turns out to be a toned-down, WSe two
light-hearted look at the daily
* grind of campus police. This Wednesdays
kind of show might not appeal at 8 p.m.
to the more boisterous, drunken G4
college student, but it will be an
entertaining way to pass some time on Wednesday
nights for those students content to chill in the liv-
ing room.
* The show leaps from college to college with
each commercial break, showing us a wintry
party at the University of Cincinnati before leap-
ing to a tow truck full of half-naked men at New
Mexico State. The nature of the crimes depicted
varies from location to location, but the one con-
stant is that all the cops are incredibly poised and
restrained. With a clear demographic of college
students, "Campus P.D." could have taken the
easy way out and made the cops look like abusive
power-mongers. But this isn't a show to appease,

justify or avenge the partying magses - it's just an
honest look behind the scenes of campus police.
That isn't to say the show is only for shut-ins.
There are scenes that will entertain everyone,
regardless of usual sobriety or weekend social
plans. Who doesn't love a drunk girl explaining
to the police that they should be patrolling poor
neighborhoods where everyone is "murdering
people and raping people and snorting drugs"?
The show's got everything from intentional,
out-of-pants outdoor urination to unintentional,
in-pants outdoor urination. See? Something for
everyone.
One of the featured police officers in "Campus
P.D.," while talking about why he enjoys his job,
stumbles upon why this show succeeds in areas
"COPS" doesn't. What that officer says he enjoys
most is the personal interaction, and crazy college
kids are going to interact with the police more
than they probably should. "COPS" is often full
of blurred, silent faces trying to avoid self-incrim-
ination. But "Campus P.D." is full of enthusiastic
youths, perfect for entertaining banter.
Unfortunately, not all the segments feature that
level of enthusiasm. While the first half of the sea-
son premiere had it's fair share of fun, the second
half slumped into the classic "COPS" formula of
stupid people not saying much or muttering lies to
the police, then getting caught. It's important the
segments not all be the same, but there's no reason
for "Campus P.D." to pick downright boring clips.
Still, there was enough promise in the pre-
miere to make "Campus P.D." worth a second
watch. Just don't expect to be yelling "Yeah, you
show those pigs, bro!" at the TV screen.

"For the last time, no. I'm not talking to you."

going to quote random studies or
pull data out of my ass to tell you that
doing something artistic every so
often will help you manage college.
I'm just going to say it worked for me,
and if you let it, it will work for you.
But maybe participating in the
arts just absolutely, positively isn't
for you. I won't hold that against
you. Arts activities aren't for every-
one, and if you aren't enjoying them,
they're pointless. Still, I don't think

there's a single one of you who can
honestly say, except in a hipster-
ironic way, "I don't like movies, music
or visual art." So make an effort to
experience something artsy. Prefer-
ably see a local band or a University
performance or art exhibit. Or go see
a show at The Ark or Blind Pig. You
could start out attending a digital
music performance, try taking a class,
and before you know it you're a Per-
forming Arts Technology major. Or if
you're not quite that inspired, it will
make you seem indie and mysterious
at parties. But I predict the arts will
do you wonders.
Art affects everyone in different

ways because it serves so many pur-
poses. Art can make you think, raise
awareness for social issues or simply
be a form of self-expression. But alot
of art exists solely to make you happy,
and a lot of people seem to forget
about that in the bustle of the college
transition. Even jaded seniors who
know the ins and outs of the Univer-
sity probably haven't heard of more
than a third of the arts groups on
campus, which could be easily fixed
with a little stroll through the Diag
today. The new year is a chance to
reinvent yourself. When you do, make
the arts a little part of your life. It will
make you a happier person.

Landowners suspected of
diverting floods in Pakistan

Wealthy may have
redirected water to
poor villages
SUKKUR, Pakistan (AP) - As
the disastrous floods recede in Pak-
istan, something new is rising: sus-
picions and rumors that powerful
officials and landowners used their
influence to divert water away from
their property and inundate the vil-
lages and fields of millions of poor
Pakistanis.
The claims are difficult to verify
and in some cases may be exag-
gerated. Yet they have spread like
wildfire across the waterlogged
countryside, further outraging
many flood victims already upset
at the government's failure to pro-
vide enough food, clean water and
shelter.
One of the risks is that Islamist
militants could seize on growing
anger to increase support for their
war against the state. Even before
the floods, many Pakistanis har-
bored a deep mistrust toward their
government and the landowning
elite.
"The politicians and the rich
and powerful just sacrificed the
people," said 30-year-old farmer
Mohammed Yousuf, who lost his
home and 11 cattle last month when
floodwaters surging down the
Indus River swept across southern
Sindh province.
The floods, which were triggered
by extremely heavy monsoon rains
in the northwest at the end of July,
have killed more than 1,600 people
across Pakistan and affected some
17 million others. At its peak, the
flood covered one-fifth of the coun-
try - an area larger than England.
Many people suspect powerful
Pakistanis were able to manipulate
the flow of water by influencing
whichlevees were breached. Levees
are tall dirt and rock embankments
meant to prevent a river from over-
flowing and can be intentionally
breached using explosives or heavy
machinery.
It was impossible to verify the
validity of the different accusa-
tions, but it was clear that many of

the allegations were being leveled
at the powerful by the largely pow-
erless.
Outrage has been especially pro-
nounced in northern Sindh where
hundreds of thousands of people -
including Yousuf - watched floods
swamp their fields and destroy
their homes as the lands of a federal
minister on the opposite side of the
Indus remained dry.
Many of these flood victims are
convinced Labor Minister Khur-
sheed Shah pushed the government
to deliberately breach a levee upriv-
er to save his property. The water
that surged through the Tori Bund
levee inundated dozens of villages
and towns west of the river, an area
that is more densely populated than
the eastern side, where Shah's lands
arelocated.
"Khursheed Shah is a tyrant!"
shouted Masood Ahmed, a25-year-
old vegetable vendor in Karampur,
a town near the western bank of
the Indus that wasentirely sur-
roundedby water. "He is the enemy
of humanity!"
The labor minister denied any
wrongdoing and Sindh Irrigation
Minister Jam Saifullah Dharejo has
said Tori Bund was not breachedby
the government but ruptured when
water flowing down the Indus
surged unexpectedly.
Residents said they were unpre-
pared for the sudden influx of water
because they had assumed authori-
ties would breach the Ali Wan levee
on the eastern bank just as they had
done when floods threatened the
area in 1976 - a move they accused
Shah of opposing.
"I had to choose between saving
my family or my cattle," said Shafi
Mohammed, 30, sitting beneath a
makeshift shelter beside a road near
Karampur. He rescued his wife and
six children but lost his home, most
of his possessions and two of his
five water buffalo.
Noor Mohammad Baloch, an
engineer and former chairman
of Pakistan's Indus River System
Authority, supported the govern-
ment's explanation of the Tori
Bund breach and said it reduced the
water pressure enough so that the
Ali Wan levee could remain intact.

But flood victims dismissed the
explanation and demanded an inde-
pendent investigation.
There was more controversy as
high water headed farther west.
Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali, a
former prime minister, criticized
members of the Sindh government
for breaching a levee to divert water
toward Baluchistan, Pakistan's
poorest province.
The decision saved the city of
Jacobabad, with about 300,000 res-
idents, and a nearby air base, but it
swamped homes and fields of 1 mil-
lion people in Baluchistan.
"If it's a national calamity, we
bow down our heads in front of the
almighty, but if it is mismanage-
ment, let an inquiry be held," said
Jamali.
Farther north, lawmaker Jam-
shed Dasti from Muzaffargargh
district in central Punjab province
accused two powerful landowning
families - the Khosas and the Han-
jras - of persuading authorities
not to breach levees on the western
side of the tndus that would have
swamped their property.
As a result, water broke through a
levee on the eastern side of the river
and inundated much of Muzaffar-
gargh, a more densely populated
area of some 3 million people, he
said.
"They wouldn't care even if
thousands of people had died," said
Dasti, who is seen as a champion of
the poor in a district dominated by
landowners. "Their only interest
is to secure their lands. They treat
common people as animals."
Ali Ahmad, a farmer in the town
of Sanawan in Muzaffargargh, said
the flooding caught people by sur-
prise because everyone expected
the water to be directed to the west-
ern side of the river.
"But one morning at around 5
a.m. we woke up to a chaotic situ-
ation," Ahmad said. "There was
water everywhere and we had to
run to safety."
The two landowning families
have denied Dasti's allegations, say-
ing the decision about which levees
should be breached was a technical
matter that was decided indepen-
dently by the government.

JOHS RAOOX/AP
Rev. Terry Jones poses at the Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville, Fla. on August 30. Jones vows to go ahead with plans
to burn copies of the Quran to protest the Sept.11, 2001 terrorist attacks despite warnings from the White House and the top
U.S. general in Afghanistan that doing so would endanger American troops overseas.
Pressure increases on pastor
who wants to burn Quran

U.S. officials warn
reverend of possible
repercussions
GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) - The
government turned up the pres-
sure yesterday on the head of a
small Florida church who plans to
burn copies of the Quran on Sept.
11, warning him that doing so could
endanger U.S. troops and Ameri-
cans everywhere.
But the Rev. Terry Jones insisted
he would go ahead with his plans,
despite criticism from the top U.S.
general in Afghanistan, the White
House and the State Department,
as well as a host of religious leaders.
Jones, who is known for posting
signs proclaiming that Islam is the
devil's religion, says the Constitu-
tion gives him the right to publicly
set fire to the book that Muslims
consider the word of God.
Gen.David Petraeus warned yes-
terday in an e-mail to The Associat-
ed Press that "images of the burning
of a Quran would undoubtedly be
used b f extremists in Afghani-
stan - and around the world - to
inflametpublic opinion and-incite
violence." It was a rare example
of a military commander taking
a position on a domestic political
matter.
Jones responded that he is also
concerned but is "wondering,
'When do we stop?"' He refused to
cancel the protest set for Saturday
at his Dove World Outreach Cen-
ter, a church that espouses an anti-
Islam philosophy.
"How much do we back down?
How many times do we back
down?" Jones told the AP. "Instead
of us backing down, maybe it's to
time to stand up. Maybe it's time to
send amessage to radicalIslam that
we will not tolerate their behavior."
Still, Jones said he will pray
about his decision.
State Department spokesman
P.J. Crowley said the administra-
tion hoped Americans would stand

up and condemn the church's plan.
"We think that these are pro-
vocative acts," Crowley said. "We
would like to see more Americans
stand up and say that this is incon-
sistent with our American values;
in fact, these actions themselves are
un-American."
Meeting yesterday with religious
leaders to discuss recent attacks on
Muslims and mosques around the
U.S., Attorney General Eric Holder
called the planned burning both
idiotic and dangerous, according
to a Justice Department official.
The official requested anonymity
because the meeting was private.
Secretary of State Hillary Rod-
ham Clinton added her disapproval
at a dinner yesterday evening in
observance of Iftar, the breaking
of the daily fast during the Muslim
holy month of Ramadan.
"I am heartened by the clear,
unequivocal condemnation of this
disrespectful, disgraceful act that
has come from American religious
leaders of all faiths," Clinton said.
At the White House, spokes-
man Robert Gibbs echoed the
concerns raised by Petraeus. "Any
type of activity like that that puts
our troops in harm's way would be
a concern to this administration,"
Gibbs told reporters.
Jones said he has received more
than 100 death threats and has
started wearing a .40-caliber pistol
strapped to his hip.
The 58-year-old minister said
the death threats started not long
after he proclaimed in July that he
would stage "International Burn-a-
Quran Day." Supporters have been
mailing copies of the Islamic holy
text to his church to be incinerated
in a bonfire.
Jones, who has about SO follow-
ers, gained some local notoriety last
year when he posted signs in front of
his small church declaring "Islam is
of the Devil." Buthis Quran-burning
scheme attracted wider attention. It
drew rebukes from Muslim nations
and anavalancheofmediainterview
requests just as an emotional debate

was taking shape over the proposed
Islamic center near the ground zero
site of the 2001 terrorist attacks in
New York.
The Quran, according to Jones,
is "evil" because it espouses some-
thing other than biblical truth and
incites radical, violent behavior
among Muslims.
"It's hard for people to believe,
but we actually feel this is a mes-
sage that we have been called to
bring forth," he said last week. "And
because of that, we do not feel like
we can back down."
Muslims consider the Quran to
be the word of God and insist it be
treated with the utmost respect,
along with any printed material
containing its verses or the name of
Allah or the Prophet Muhammad.
Any intentional damage or show of
disrespect to the Quran is deeply
offensive.
Jones' Dove Outreach Center is
independent of any denomination.
The church follows the Pentecostal
tradition, which teaches that the
Holy Spirit can manifest itself in
the modern day. Pentecostals often
view themselves as engaged in spir-
itual warfare against satanic forces.
At first glance, the church looks
like a warehouse rather than a place
of worship. A stone facade and a
large lighted cross adorn the front
of the beige steel building, which
stands on 20 acres in Gainesville's
leafy northern suburbs. Jones and
his wife, Sylvia, live on the property
and also use part of it to store furni-
ture that they sell on eBay.
A broad coalition of religious
leaders from evangelical, Roman
Catholic, Jewish and Muslim orga-
nizations met in Washington on
Tuesday and condemned the plan
to burn the Quran as a violation of
American values.
"This is not the America that
we all have grown to love and care
about," said Rabbi Steve Gutow
of the Jewish Council for Public
Affairs. "We have to stand up for
our Muslim brothers and sisters
and say, "This is not OK."'

Michigan lawmakers agree
on some parts of state budget *

State agencies may
see 3-percent cut in
spending
LANSING, Mich. (AP) - Mich-
igan's legislative leaders and Gov.
Jennifer Granholm's administra-
tion agreed in concept yesterday
on ways to balance the state bud-
get, a significant step toward get-
ting a final plan in place by an Oct.
1 deadline.
Legislative leaders and Gra-
nholm recently have worked on
plans that include spending cuts
of about 3 percent for most state
agencies, some sort of retire-
ment incentive program for state
workers and a tax amnesty pro-
gram. All of the ideas were most
recently proposed by Granholm
last month.
Spokespeople for Granholm,
Republican Senate Majority Lead-
er Mike Bishop and Democratic
House Speaker Andy Dillon would
not confirm details of the plan -
which hadn't yet been signed by
negotiators - late yesterday.
Granholm spokeswoman Liz
Boyd said the agreement on bud-
get targets was expected to be
signed Wednesday and that the

administration would comment
then.
The agreement would include
targets for erasing a general fund
deficit of $302 million this fiscal
year and a shortfall of $484 mil-
lion for the budget year that begins
Oct. 1. It's the final round of annual
budget bargaining between the
term-limited Granholm and legis-
lative leaders, many of whom will
be in new jobs - in and out of state
government - at the beginning of
next year.
Committees made up of mem-
bers from the Republican-led Sen-
ate and Democrat-run House will
have to iron out specifics of budget
proposals before putting them up
for votes in the Legislature. Some
proposals could be tough to pass,
such as the retirement incentive
idea that's been greeted with skep-
ticism by some Democrats.
Union leaders have been against
a similar plan that was passed ear-
lier this year for the state's public
school employees because workers
who stay on the job have to con-
tribute more to a retiree health
care fund.
Michigan's public schools
should be safe from further bud-
get cuts, but many other agencies
will be asked to deepen spending

reductions they've made in recent
years. Granholm has said that can
be done without layoffs, but labor
union leaders aren't sure where the
savings would come from instead.
"I think it's going to be a real
challenge," said Ray Holman, leg-
islative liaison for United Auto
Workers Local 6000, which rep-
resents about 17,000 state work-
ers. "We just don't have any more
things to cut."
Michigan lawmakers have
missed the Oct. 1 budget deadline
in two of the past three years. The
worst consequence of missing bud-
get deadlines was a partial govern-
mentshutdown of about four hours
in 2007.
Michigan's constitution
requires a balanced budget.
Michigan Supreme Court Chief
Justice Marilyn Kelly and Justice
Diane Hathaway, both nominated
by Democrats, would have granted
"The Tea Party" request to appeal
and further contest the case.
The majority was formed by
three Republican-nominated jus-
tices and two Democratic-nom-
inated justices, including Alton
Thomas Davis, who was appointed
to the Supreme Court by Demo-
cratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm last
week.

Officer killed
immigrant who was
carrying a knife
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Pro-
testers on Tuesday night pelted
a police station with eggs, rocks
and bottles despite Police Chief
Charlie Beck's plea for calm ear-
lier in the day and his promise to
thoroughly investigate an offi-
cer's fatal shooting of a Guatema-
lan immigrant wielding a knife.
At a late-afternoon news
conference, Beck said only 40
seconds went by between the
time officers made contact with
Manuel Jamines on Sunday and
the moment an officer shot him
twice.
The shooting prompted dem-
onstrations Monday near MacAr-
thur Park, a densely packed
neighborhood west of downtown
populated with recent immi-
grants from Central America.
Four people were arrested on
suspicion of misdemeanor incit-
ing a riot, and others threw rocks
and bottles at police, slightly
injuring three officers, Officer

"I think if (Renden) hadn't lost
his life he would have been behind

Despite supporting the ordi-
nance, LSA senior John Oltean,
a representative from the Michi-
gan Student Assembly, spoke out
against voting on it last night,
pointing out that it fell on the very
first day of University classes.
"I'd like to give (students) time
to gauge support," Oltean said.
Oltean also voiced the assem-
bly's position that the current ordi-

"We are celebrating the response
of our students to Kennedy's chal-
lenge to serve others in developing
countries," Greisberger said.
The symposium will begin Oct.
13 and will feature several panels
of speakers - those who partici-
pated in the organization and those
working for it - who will discuss
the importance of the Peace Corps
and how it changed them for the
better. There will also be a student-
led symposium that night, where
stuydents will address important
issues pertaining to international
service and student activism.
The symposium will come to a
close at 2 a.m. the following morn-
ing with a reenactment of Ken-

on North Campus in their housing
application.
Unlike many freshmen resi-
dence halls, each Northwood unit
is equipped with a kitchen and
bathroom. The three buildings
share outdoor common spaces, like
small gazebos and picnic tables, as
well as a common laundry area and
indoor lounge equipped with wire-
less Internet access. Despite the
distinctive layout, the residence
hall is staffed just like any other
dormitory and outfitted with the
same modular furniture.
Because University Hous-
ing held to the move-in date they
announced, the new hall was pre-
pared very quickly, with additional
plumbing and carpentry, fire and
safety system testing and the addi-
tion of wireless access all complet-
ed by the end of the summer.
After the extensive preparation,
Logan said there was alot of excite-
ment surrounding the opening of
the new living option.
"This was something of a bold
step for us because we had not
placed first-year students in apart-
ment-type living arrangements
before," he said.
Though officials were excited to
offer the non-traditional accom-
modations, Logan said a major
concern was maintaining a sense of
community in the apartment set-
ting.
"We don't want to place first-
year students into an isolated situ-
ation like an apartment," Logan
said. "But, after creating a con-
tiguous community and then pro-
gramming it and staffing it, we
think it will be an interesting liv-
ing arrangement."

nance too narrowly addresses fire
safety.
"We feel many houses aren't
(safe) in other ways," Oltean told
the council. "We just want to make
sure council is fully addressing the
issue of fire safety
When the time to vote arrived,
Council member Christopher Tay-
lor (D-Ward 3) - the ordinance's
original sponsor - acknowledged
Oltean's concerns and advised a
postponement.
"There has been a broad degree
of uncertainty in the student popu-
lation (about) the ordinance," Tay-
nedy's speech. Audio clips from
Kennedy's original speech will be
played, which Greisberger said
"challenged students to use their
education to help others around
the world."
In addition to these two kick-off
symposiums there will be other
events throughout the year at the
University and around the country
celebratingthe anniversary.
Kevin Quigley, president of the
National Peace Corps Association,
said Kennedy's speech and the
establishment of the Peace Corps
laid the foundation for young
Americans to volunteer around the
globe ,,,
"(Kennedy's) challenge lit a
torch that encouraged students to
help others throughout the world,"
Quigley said.
But student activism at the Uni-
In addition, because Housing
officials view the dining experience
as an essential part of campus inte-
gration, each student is required
to have a meal plan, Logan said.
Accordingly, many of the residents
eat their meals across the street at
Bursley Hall.
Engineering sophomore Aaron
Frantz, vice president for finance
of the Residence Hall Association,
said he's unsure how successful the
separate houses will be at fostering
a strong community.
"As separate apartments those
buildings were designed so that
you could have your own personal
space in your own little corner
on North Campus," he said. "And
they're trying now to change that
model into a community, while the
architecture doesn't exactly facili-
tate that."
Several programs specifically
geared towards first-year students
have been held in the new hall,
including using Mapquest to find
classes and touring buildings, as
well as group walks to the football
games - all in addition to annual
North Campus events such as
Northfest.
Trey Boynton, the Northwood
Housing First Year Experience
program coordinator, said the first-
year programs in the Northwood
Houses worked within the bizarre
layout rather than trying to over-
come the physical obstacles of indi-
vidual apartments.
"We have to be mindful of our
community space," she said. "We
use the living rooms (in each unit),
and we're taking advantage of the
weather while we have it by having
a lot of our meetings on the lawn."
Boynton also said the different
space presents opportunities not
available in a regular residence
hall.

Ior said.
Taylor added that he wanted
to give students an opportunity
to familiarize themselves with
the ordinance before the council
reached a final decision.
"It is in everyone's interest for
students to have a fulsome under-
standing of the ordinance," Taylor
said. "For thatpurpose, give us all a
little more time."
If passed, the ordinance will go
into effect within 10 days, Taylor
said in an interview last night.
In an interview after last night's
meeting, Ann Arbor Fire Mar-

shall Kathleen Chamberlain said
Fire Department officials back the
ordinance because they believe
it would ensure the safety of stu-
dents and other Ann Arbor resi-
dents.
Chamberlain added that if
the ordinance is passed the Fire
Department plans to be more
instructive than disciplinary in its
regulation.
"Our intention is not to issue
violations ... our intention is to edu-
cate," Chamberlain said.
"One life is too many to lose," she
added.

Bruce Borihanh said.
The protest gained steam
again Tuesday night, when about,
100 people took their complaints
to the Rampart police station
near downtown Los Angeles,.
about two blocks from where
Jamines died, said Lt. Andrew.,
Neiman.
Officers were trying to move,
the demonstrators away from the,
station but had made no arrests
as of 9:30 p.m.
Beck said the incident involv-
ing Jamines started when some.

suspect and told him in Span-
ish and English to put down the,
knife. Instead, Jamines raised
the knife above his head and
lunged at Officer Frank Her-
nandez, a 13-year veteran of th,
department, Beck said.
Eyewitness accounts from six
civilians, nine police personnel
and two fire department staff
indicate Hernandez fired twice
"in immediate defense of life,"
Beck said. Jamines, 37, died at
the scene.

"We get to be a li' Je more adven-
turous and creative because we all

cool,"she said.
Though several students seem
satisfied with their new residence,
opinions vary on the level of com-
munity available.
Music school freshman Pavithra
Ramachandran said it isn't as easy
to meet people as it is in other halls.
"It's not like a dorm room where
you can just basically walk down a
row and meet people because here
you just have a neighbor or two,"
she said.
Music school freshman Alison
Aliquina said though she is very
happy with her living situation, she
hasn't seen much of a community
in the new residence hall.
"I'm happy I don't have to share
a bathroom with other people," she
said. "But you don't branch out as
much here, and instead get closer
to your tight-knitgroup."
Despite some feelings of dis-
connectedness, most residents are
happy to say that resident advisors
are very helpful in making them
feel welcome and adjusted.
Boynton said a main reason
the staff has been so successful in
integrating with the students is
the number of RAs available to the
small number of students.
"The student to staff ratio is real-
ly super low," she said. "It allows
our staff to really get to know our
students."
Boynton said that despite com-
munity obstacles, the response has
been overwhelmingly positive.
"My favorite story is about a
student who walked in and yelled,
'Oh, my gosh, this is awesome,"' she
said. "And then his mom walked
in and yelled, 'Oh, my gosh, this is
amazing!' So there was a lot of posi-
tive yelling going on."

Logan also said that to his
knowledge, the reaction to the new
hall has been positive so far and
that despite the less community-
oriented architecture, students are
still meeting each other.
"There seems to be a lot of
engagement between students and
student staff," he said. "And there
seems to be an interest in forming
their community council.".
Frantz said the RHA is very
excited about the new addition to
campus, and that RHA represen-
tatives have already begun taking
steps to get the new residence hall
prepared for the coming year.
"We're looking forward to inte-
grating a whole new community
with a very different flavor," he
said. "We are talking with hall
directors and trying to get a hall
council and multicultural council
set up so that when the first RHA
assembly meeting happens they
can be seated and functioning."
Frantz says the new addition has
already had a substantial impact
on the usually sparsely populated
North Campus.
"I was surprised to find the din-
ing hall really full," he said. "And
I was amazed when, on the first
night of move-in, I needed to catch
a bus and it was completely filled
with girls in miniskirts and guys in
undershirts."
Logan said that if the new resi-
dence hall is successful, Housing
officials will continue the program
in coming years.
"When we decided to take this
approach we decided it wouldn't
be a quick fix or a band-aid effort,"
he said. "We're hopeful that this
will suceeed and provide us with
yet a new ongoing first year expe-
rience for incoming students
because we don't know where
we'll be next year."

the multidisciplinary emphasis
has created more of a cohesive
community on North Campus.
"We still have I think a long
way to go in this area," Munson
said. "But we have, I think, some
notable achievements."
As a part of uniting students
and faculty members on North
Campus, Munson annually hosts
a Halloween party on the North
Campus Diag, and Munson is
never without a costume. In past
years, Munson has dressed in
clever get-ups such as the Vlasic
Pickle stork, a football goalpost
and the Michigan Wolverine.
Munson pointed to the new
Living Arts living-learning com-
munity - an interdisciplinary
residential program in Bursley
Hall designed for students from
all colleges who want to explore
their creativity - as a product of
the multidisciplinary emphasis
on North Campus.
Hanlon wrote in the release
that Munson has been a leader
in promoting multidisciplinary
work across campus and in reach-
ing out to industry partners.
For graduate students, Mun-
son said he hasworked to improve
the overall quality of the Ph.D.
programs in the college, partially
by enforcing stricter credentials
for incoming students.
He added that he stressed
the importance of research pro-
grams in the college and encour-
aged researchers to write more
proposals for larger research
centers. He said research fund-
ing has increased by a wide mar-
gin over his four years as dean,
citing some research programs
that cost on the order of $20 mil-
lion.

Munson said that this fall,
faculty, staff and students in
the College of Engineering will
collaborate to set goals for the
future of the college. He declined
to give specifics, saying he didn't
want to reveal anything without
having the full support of the
entire College of Engineering
community.
Before coming to the Univer-
sity, Munson earned his under-
graduate degree in electrical
engineering from the University
of Delaware. He then went on
to receive M.S., M.A. and Ph.D.
degrees in electrical engineering
from Princeton University. After
receiving his Ph.D., he conducted
research and taught electrical a
and computer engineering at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign. He came to the Uni-
versity in 2003 where he becamegr
the chair of the Electrical Engi-
neering and Computer Science
Department at the University.
A co-founder of InstaRecon, "
Inc., a University of Illinois-
based company thatpatents algo-
rithms to increase the efficiency
of image formation on comput-
ers, Munson focuses his teaching
and research on signal and image
processing.
Munson has also served as a
consultant to the Lockheed Palo ,
Alto Research Laboratory and is
a co-author of a widely used high
school textbook that introduces
students to computer science.
As a fellow of the Institute
of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (IEEE), Munson has:
received a number of awards,
including the Society Award
from the IEEE Signal Process-
ing Society and the IEEE Third
Millennium Medal. Munson was .
also the Texas Instruments Dis-

Van Bergen uses mother's
motivation to keep focused

Senior goalkeeper Chris Blais is expected to be a huge part of the defense this
year, as many of his teammates have said he's taken on a leadership role.
This could be the
year the picsfit

ut all the correct pieces
together and the puzzle
will be complete, right?
In the world of sports, the
answer is not always yes.
The 11
starting
members CASANDRA
of the PAGNI
Michigan On Men's Soccer
men's soc-
cer team
- and the remainder waiting to
get their feet wet in a game - are
a mix of new talent and experi-
enced leaders. The 2010 squad
features dangerous offensive
weapons to complement a veter-
an backfield and an experienced
keeper.
This year's group has the
potential to be one of the most
successful teams that Michigan
head coach Steve Burns has
coached in his 11 years at the
helm.
Even with what seems like the
right pieces on the field, poten-
tial hasn't always translated into
victories for the Wolverines.

Completing the puzzle means
fighting for a trip to the playoffs
for the first time since 2008, and
this year's Wolverines clearly
has their work cut out for them.
The current roster features
a special mix of energetic, very
skillful youth, with win-hungry
veterans who understand just
what's at stake every time they
take the field.
One of the veterans - junior
keeper Chris Blais - anchors
Michigan's defense in his second
season as the Wolverine starter.
Blais is as locked-in to the game
as they come -- and even trained
with the MLS Seattle Sound-
ers this summer to ensure he
continued to get better in the
offseason.
Last season, Blais ranked sec-
ond in the Big Ten with a save
percentage of .761 and a goals
against average of 1.16. This year,
the goalkeeper is a team captain
and has become an obvious vocal
leader from the box.

When Ryan Van Bergen played
football at Whitehall High School,
most of the stories written about
him were very positive. But, when
one particular story discussed how
the current Michigan defensive
lineman was undeserving of an
award, that's the clipping that made
the refrigerator at home.
Van Bergen's mom, Toni, started
defending her son at an early age.
She would bring his birth certificate
to his football games. He started
playing when he was eight or nine
years old, but he was always bigger
than the other kids. Other mothers
protested.
As he's grown up, Toni's tough
love has been a constant motiva-
tion for Van Bergen. Toni will see a
small line in an article that's nega-
tive about Van Bergen's play, she'll
highlight it and e-mail it to him. The
message is understood by now: keep
your head on right, and prove the
doubters wrong.
"She tries to do her best to moti-
vate me," Van Bergen said. "I'm her
baby, so she's gotta do something.
She's like, 'You gotta do something,
this is what they said about you.' I
love her to death, but she's a good
motivator. She sends me stuff all the
time."
Van Bergen reads every single
one. He knows that when he calls
home it will come up in conversa-
tion - often about once every other
day.
After last Saturday's 30-10 win
over Connecticut, the entire Michi-
gan football team could learn some-
thing from the lessons that Toni
had taught her son over the years.
"The whole coaching staff is
emphasizing to stay healthy," Van
Bergen said. "Last year, we started
out 4-0, everybody was very excited
about our season, then things start-
ed to head south. So staying hungry
and staying motivated is something
our team is going to preach all year
- just to continue to try and prove

critics wrong."
Michigan coach Rich Rodri-
guez isn't getting too high after the
season-opening win. At Monday's
press conference, he noted several
areas where he felt the team could
have done better in the 20-point
win. Even with the outside world
spinning throughout a summer of
NCAA allegations and then a week
one win, internally the Wolverines
are calm and steady - so Rodriguez
says.
"You're just one bad day away'
from everybody else saying what
they were saying about you last
week," Rodriguez said. "It's like
poison - it's okay as long as you
don't swallow it. They won't be
swallowing it, because they know
it's still out there."
As for Van Bergen's effort in the
win, Toni might not have a lot of
ammunition tomotivate her son. He
finished with four tackles. He made
the less-than-glamorous plays that
won't show up on the stat sheet, but
are vital for any team.
The redshirt junior is now in his
second year as a starter on defense,
but Van Bergen switched posi-
tions in the offseason. Last year,

he played as the three-technique
defensive tackle and now he's play-
ing defensive end - filling Brandon
Graham's void after he graduated
and was drafted bythe Philadelphia
Eagles.
Before Graham left, Van Bergen
looked to him in differentsituations
to learn what to do and how to grow
from his experience. But now, Van
Bergen is one of the defense's men-
tors and he's the one handing out
pointers.
"I think it's somethingthat hope-
fully, Me, Mike (Martin) and Craig
(Roh) can use to rub off on some of
the guys who haven'thad that expe-
rience, and be able to bring them
through it," Van Bergen said of his
experience. "Because you don't
want anybody out there who isn't
getting help who needs it."
Already, after just one week, Van
Bergen and Martin have already
stamped their play on defense.
With the Huskies' running game
pushing to the outside, the duo had
to routinely get off blocks and make
tackles down the field.With athree-
man front on defense, Van Bergen
said that the Huskies shifted their
protection to his and Martin's side

Redshirt junior defensive end Ryan Van Bergen switched to defensive end this offseason to replace Brandon Graham.

- freeing up Roh for one-on-one
opportunities to beat a blocker and
make plays in the backfield.
"We kinda gave him a gift in that
way," Van Bergen said. "But he did
really well with it. And if he's going
to keep doing things like he's doing,
we'll take the bullets."
Roh finished with five tackles,
two of which were for a loss. Martin
had two tackles and shared a tackle
for a loss.
The Wolverines' ability to tackle
and get pressure on the quarterback
- even without Graham - could be
a lifesaver for the defense: protect
a young secondary and have your
experienced players carry the load.
Van Bergen's not worried about
letting up this year.
He said the gas pedal was still
hitting the floor, even when Michi-
gan was up big on Saturday. Toni
would probably like itthatway.
And despite her motivational
tactics thus far, she doesn't send the
clips to her son's teammates - at
least not just yet.
"If they wanted it, my mom
would probably get their e-mails
and forward it," Van Bergen said.
"Gotta love a mom."

AD Brandon reacts to newer, "Bigger"
House, game day rededication festivities

By TIM 1iOHAN
Daily Sports Writer
Moments after Michigan wrapped up
a 30-10 win over Connecticut to begin the
2010 season on Saturday, Michigan Athletic
Director Dave Brandon praised the pre-
game festivities as well as the play on the
field.
In front of the largest crowd ever to
watch a football game - 113,090 people -
Michigan rededicat-
ed the Big House and First seen on

"We wanted this
to be special," Brandon said after the game.
"It was 1927 the last time we had a dedica-
tion ceremony here. So my challenge to the
marketing team was, and we've been plan-
ning this for months, if one flyover is good,
let's have two. And let's not just cut the rib-
boo, let'sblow off some fireworks. We really
wanted to showcase the history of the sta-
dium with that video and obviously Brock.
Bfrock is an inspiration to this team. He's got
to share this victory today too."
Brock Mealer, the brother of Michigan
offensive lineman Elliott Mealer, was told
he had a one-percent chance of walking
again after a car crash left him paralyzed
and his father and brother's girlfriend dead.
Healer led the team out of the tunnel and
was the first to touch the banner.
"I held it together pretty well until that
moment (when he touched the banner) and
I'll tell you why," Brandon said. "I sat with
him, we planned this wholecthing. I told him
how we need to make this whole thing hap-
pen. He was great about it. And I'm getting
ready to leave and he kinda called me over

and said, 'Mr. Brandon, would it be okay if
I touched the banner?' And that's what he
wanted to do - that's what he did."
The festivities also included a video mon-
tage in tribute to the new Michigan Stadi-
um, with the voice-over recorded by Keith
Jackson.
When the game began, it was the Denard
Robinson show. Brandon was among those
impressed by the sophomore quarterback's
performance. Robinson threw for 186 yards
and ran for 197 more - setting a school
record for rushing yardsoby a quarterback in
a single game.
"He's got that speed," Brandon said. "You
notice several times, guys, you think you've
got the angle on him and he just leaves them
behind. He just has that afterburner kind
of speed that just gives him that break-

away threat every time he has the ball in
his hands. It was a big game for Denard.
And don'tforget, go look at his passing stats,
his completion percentage. If you think too
much about the run, he's going to burn you."
The win over the Huskies could set the
tone for the rest of the season. Brandon
always said that the team was working
hard to get back to Michigan's winning
tradition.
"I've been to enough football practices,
been in a few of them, to know when a team
is practicing for a purpose," Brandon said.
"This is a team that has been practicing for
a purpose. You can just tell with the hustle.
You can tell with the attitude. And the way
they push one another and the way the
coaches were pushing them. We're off to a
good start - long season ahead."

Athletic Director David Brandon yreyares to cut the ribbon at the lie House rededication ceremony.

defense features two seniors in Chase
Tennant and Jeff Quijano. In their final
season as Wolverines, these defenders
know that without last year's defensive
MVP Julian Robles, the job of locking
down the backside of the field and help-
ing Blais is left to them.
But Blais, Tennant, Quijano and the
other Michigan defenders have already
shown their ability to stifle opponents'
attacks, as they held the 14th-ranked
Drake Bulldogs to only four shots on goal

and one goa1 in Friday's contest.
Two of Michigan's cop three scorers
from last season - senior forward Justin
Meram and sophomore midfielder Ham-
oody Saad - return but have their work
cut out for them, as leading scorer Mourn
Fuzetti is now playing professional soc-
But the duo hasn't given fans any rea-
son to worry about a lack of offensive
flair, as Hamoody Saad has one of Michi-
gan's two goals already this season - his
overtime goal led the Wolverines to their
first victory over Detroit. Meram had
nine shots in Friday's loss to Drake, and
led the team with four shots on goal.

"I think you're almays looking to make
sure there are those spiritual leaders on
the field and Justin is one of those guys,"
Burns said. "He can get his team moti-
vated, heroan be dynamic on the field. He
involves his teammates really well."
Despite losing former stars Rubles
and Fuzetti, this year's group is headed
by a strong senior class, which leads as a
group. Those upperclassmen know what
the playoffs feel like, as Michigan last
made an NCAA Sweet 16 appearance in
2008 during their sophomore year.
Itlis the seasoned Wolverines who
know they will need the entire team -
not just certain pieces of puzzle - to step

up and make big plays to keep them in Big
Ten contention, and that means getting
solid production out of their high-profile,
highly recruited freshmen starters.
Michigan's freshmen have been
described as "fresh legs" for the team -
as they have continually provided a burst
of offensive energy thus far in the season,.
Freshman forward Soony Saad and
midfielder Fabio Pereria have combined
for 10 shots on goal in Michigan's two
games, and already it's clear that these
true freshmen will create legitimate scor-
ing opportunities for their team.
Burns combines a group that has
proven its ability to score and block shots

in the net with rookies who are eager to
get their names on the stat sheet. While
the season is young and only time will tell
what'this group can accomplish, Michi-
gao fields a balanced, fundamentally
sound team with a solid senior class as its
anchor.
The pieces ore in place, and only time
will tell what picture the puzzle will
reveal.
But for the record, don't be surprised
if this group of Wolverines light up their
brand new stadium this year.

SMART APPLIANCES
What if you had the ability to come
home after a long day of class and com-
mand your kitchen appliances to pre-
pare your favorite meal? Or have your
radio automatically play your favorite
songs? This could one day be com-
monplace in households around the
world with technology developed by
John Marshall, assistant professor at
the School of Art and Design and the
Taubman College of Architecture and
Urban Planning.
Marshall's creation, Tea House for
Robots (THR-33), consists of a group
of three robotically designed hybrids
that are a mix of common household
appliances and motor vehicles, each
with specific behaviors. These include
TST_003 (a toaster), RDO_002 (a
radio) and MXR_011 (a stand mixer).
To showcase the technology, Mar-
shall displays the three robots in a 9' x
9' x 6' Japanese-style tea house made
out of layers of laser-cut synthetic
paper that are sewn together. This
house provides the means for humans
to interact with the robots, through
a program called the OMRON Smile
Scan, a face detecting technology con-
nected with the tea house in the form
of "eyes."
By compiling data on facial proper-
ties from about a million people over 10
years, the program is capable of mea-
suring the degree of someone's smile
from 0% to100%.When a person grins
into a camera outside of the house, it
consequently determines how wide
the tea house "eyes" open.
If the person smiles largely enough
to cause the tea house "eyes" to open
wide, they allow a direct line of vision
between themselves and the robots.
This allows the robot to "see" the per-
son, activating the robot's infrared
sensors.
When the toaster robot "sees"
someone, it becomes illuminated from
the inside and starts its toasting cycle,
extending its toasting arms forward to
await slices of bread. The radio begins
to play sounds, and the mixer begins to
spin away from the human and begin
mixing.
This revolutionary idea for interac-

tive appliances could extend beyond
the realm of Marshall's Japanese tea
house. The notion of smart appli-
ances could extend to nearly anything
around the modern home, making it
possible for appliances such as wash-
ing machines to run on command and
immediately know what type of wash
it should begin, or lights to turn on
to specific preferential settings. Ulti-
mately, it could meana whole new way
of living.

GLUCOSE TATTOOS
A diabetic who needs to check his or
her insulin levels currently needs to
draw blood. But one University pro-
fessor has made great strides toward
making testing for glucose levels as
easy as wearing a temporary tattoo.
EngineeringProf.JoergLahanncre-
ated particles with multiple, defined
compartments. These types of par-
ticles can be filled with dye so the front
and back are two different colors - for
example, yellow and red - and would
show a different color depending on
chemical levels. This way, individu-
als can optically distinguish between
the two colors and the particles can be
used as a diagnostic system to detect
levels of certain molecules.
The surfaces of one of the compart-
ments - say, the yellow compartment
- contains antibodies, but the other
one is unbinding. If a patient wants to
test, say, glucose levels, the particles
will only link to that side, and will
align in such a way thatconly the yellow
color is visible. Once the glucose levels
become stable, the particles fall apart
and the color becomes orange - a mix
of the two.
The particles work as a "temporary
diagnostic tattoo," Lahann says. They
stay in your skin for about four months
before they need tobe replaced.
"It's almost like a check-engine
light," Lahann said. "So it's like, 'hey,
you're dehydrated, drink some water.'
So, if you have a reduction in the water
level ... you could essentially detect the
color change and you drink and it gets
better."

editor's note

T our readers,
In compiling this week's issue, Statement editors, with the help of Daily
Staff Reporter Bethany Biron, scoured the University community for
names, ideas and concepts from University professors, unit deans, student leaders
and Ann Arbor residents alike. Though we had at first anticipated receiving a few
dozen ideas, we eventually ended up with just under 100 submissions.
In choosing the twelve ideas we would profile for this issue, we soon came to
realize just how hard a task we had. And though our final list may not necessarily
be the twelve best, it does begin to uncover just what amazing work is being done at

this university, work that often times goes unnocited by the average student.
Some of the ideas we weren't able to include: A device that recycles personal
items to create new household products; an artificla foot that conserves energy,
making it easier for amputees to walk; a protein cell that could potentially switch
off cancer cells and technology that helps prevent automobile crashes.
We hope that, in reading this issue, you'll begin to understand just what innova-
tive, world-changing work is being done at this University.
Thanks,
Trevor Calero, Magazine Editor

WELLO WATERWHEEL
Creative thinking was the weapon
of choice for Ross graduate Cynthia
Koenig, who transformed an already
existing concept into an innovative
business and humanitarian effort.
The concept of "rolling water" in
the world's rural regions has been
around for about 15 years as a meth-
od of transporting water from far-
away sources, Koenig said. It greatly
alleviates the strain of traditional
water collection - think balancing
heavy pails of water on your head -
by rolling the water across terrains
for more efficient water retrieval.
Two tools for rolling water have
been introduced in South Africa,
but these products only yielded lim-
ited success as it was impossible for
many rural residents to afford them.
Koenig embarked on a bold ven-
ture to make this concept of water
transportation more accessible to
rural residents. Wello, the non-
profit company that she founded in
January 2008, focuses primarily on
the much-overlooked issue of water
accessibility in rural areas around
the globe.
Koenig materialized her vision in
the form of a WaterWheel, a dura-
ble plastic container that is pushed
much like a lawnmower and capable
of transporting 20 gallons of water
in one trip. Traditional water gath-
ering methods only allowed about
five gallons of water to be carried
at once. To put this into perspec-
tive, the United Nations Develop-
ment Programme determined that
humans require a minimum of five
gallons of water per day to maintain
reasonable health and hygiene. The
WaterWheel makes this possible for
a family of four.

Through Wello, Koenig was
able the address the limitations of
both water accessibility and water
retrieval by manufacturing the
WaterWheel locally. Koenig said
her idea involves bringing the fac-
tory right into the rural community
via onsite mobile manufacturing.
The elimination of shipping costs
will make her product more readily
available to rural residents.
Koenig envisions that residents
can use the WaterWheel not only for
personal use, but to transport water
and goods to sell in their own com-
munities. Koenig adds that on-site
manufacturing of the product will
also create more jobs for residents.
Koenig has only recently returned
from field testing the product in Raj-
asthan, India, looking at potential
markets and usability of her prod-
uct. Koenig adds that she has also
developed partnerships with Indian
organizations like Barefoot College
and Seva Mandir to aid her venture.

CAR NETWORKING
In an age of social networking, there
are numerous ways to satisfy a Face-
book or Twitter fix on the go. From
laptops, to cell phones, to iPads, it's
nearly impossible not to be con-
nected. And with the help of a team
of past and present University stu-
dents, social networking may soon
be extended to the automobile.
The team - comprised of Engi-
neering graduates Collin Hockey,
John Ciccone and Joe Phillips and
School of Information student
Sangmi Park - developed Caravan
Track, an in-car application that
allows multiple cars to connect and

share information while on the road.
Caravan Track can relay informa-
tion between cars, like current loca-
tion, speed and fuel level to make
planning within a group easier.
They created the program last
spring as part of a social network-
ing and transportation applica-
tion competition offered through
a University course called "Cloud
Computing in the Commute." The
contest, sponsored by Ford Research
and Advanced Engineering, chal-
lenged students to create the future
of in-car technology.
The program also serves as an
effort to decrease cell phone use
while driving, as it allows drivers
to communicate with one another
through prewritten messages that
are read aloud over other vehicles'
stereos.
The idea for the application was
inspired from the team's personal
experiences with group travel.
"If you've ever been on a long-dis-
tance trip involving multiple cars,
you know that it's a pain to keep
things organized," Phillips said. "It
involves lots of phone calls and con-
fusion. I like to know what's going
on and to be able to communicate
rapidly, and this application puts
almost all the required communica-

tion and information in one place."
For winning the contest, the team
got a chance to test out their inven-
tion in a Ford Fiesta during a two-
week road trip from Ann Arbor to
San Mateo, Calif. where they dis-
played their invention at Maker
Faire-a science and technology-
based fair that celebrates student
inventions.

tive carries a water
pail. Wello aims to
elimate this type of
transport by creat-
ing more accessible
mater sources. Photo

Koenig
Ciccone said he sees this program
as a step toward the future of auto-
mobile technology.
"I think we will eventually see
desktop-class computer applications -
in vehicles, like those created for
this class," Ciccone said. "Driving
will become a more social and inter-
active experience."

BABY CHIC
By his or her first birthday, an infant
can grow to about three times its orig-
inal size. With this drastic change,
many parents find themselves shell-
ing out hundreds for new clothes,
only to have to replace them in a mat-
ter of months.
It was this knowledge that moti-
vated Engineering senior and MPow-
ered member Allen Kim to create
bebaroo.com-a sort of Netflix-style
rental website for baby clothes - with
University alum Luis Calderon. The
website, still in its beta phase, allows
parents to rent baby clothes at up to
80 percent off the full price garment
and then exchange the clothes when
their child outgrows them.
"I figured there's got to be a smart-
er way for parents to clothe their
kids," Kim said.
Like Netflix users renting DVDs,
Bebaroo customers choose a price
plan based on the number of clothing

items they want to be able to rent at
once, anywhere from one to 23 items.
The clothes are then delivered to
their door free of charge. The parents
return the clothes in a pre-paid box
when they are ready for new ones.
Price plans start at $15 a month and
go up to $100 a month.
Moreover, the items parents can
choose from aren't the typical run-
of-the-mill baby clothes. With brands
ranging from Baby Gap and Juicy
Couture to Burberry and Polo Ralph
Lauren, and with over 3,000 differ-
ent items to select from, Bebaroo
customers can dress their children in
clothing that could otherwise be too
expensive for them.
Kim said an integral part of the
business is ensuring cleanliness of
the clothing, an issue he realizes
is extremely important to parents.
Bebaroo follows a cleaning regimen
established by the National Diapers
Association in which all rented gar-

news in review

ments are first washed with scent-
free, die-free, all organic detergent,
and then packaged in hermitically
sealed bags.

its pilot-stage, the website has already

For his work on Bebaroo, Kim has
been selected as a finalist in Entre-
preneur Magazine's "Entrepre-
neur of 2010" award in the College

"I'm living up to my dream,"
Kim said. "I always wanted to be an
entrepreneur and this is something
that I started for the first time and
it's going great and customers are
liking it. It's been an amazing, fan-

MULTISENSORY ADS
Every Westin Hotel around the
world, from New York to New
Delhi, smells exactly the same.
But the hotel chain's signature
scent - White Tea by Westin - not
only provides a fragrant welcome,
but also acts as a subconscious
marketingploy.
Marketing Prof. Aradhna Krish-
na's research in the burgeoning
field of multisensory marketing
shows that this specific type of
advertising specifically targets
peoples subconscious and may be
more effective than traditional
forms of marketing.
"What sensory marketing does
is it affects people in a more sub-
conscious matter," Krishnassaid.
"Por instance, I've done research
on smell. I've shown that ifa prod-
uct has a very unique smell, than
memory for other aspects of the
product increases."
Krishna has conducted numer-
ous studies on different aspects of

multisensory marketing, but, specifi-
cally, a study completed in November
2009 found that scented products
help individuals better remember
details about a product.
"Smell has really strong associa-
tions with memory," EKrishna said.
"Among all the senses smell has a
more direct connection with good
memory. So, if other aspects of infor-
mation get stored along with smell,
than the likelihood of (retaining that
information) is also higher."
Krishna said the study she and her
fellow researchers conducted was
"painstaking." The researchers asked
about 150 collegestudents to study
a brand-name pencil, as well as an
itemized list of 10 features of the pen-
cil. Some of the pencils given to stu-
dents were normal, scentless pencils
while others were doused in a scented
oil.
Two weeks after the initial meet-
ing, the average student couldn't
remember any of the unscented pen-
cil's selling points. However, without
being provided the scent again, the
students remembered about three
details of the scented pencils.
Krishna's research is already being
implemented into the marketplace.
Westin, for example, sells White Tea
scented candles and oil diffusers.
Additionally, Westin hands out scent-
ed pens called Aromawriters for hotel
guests to take home.
"They put the signature scent of
Westin Hotels in the pen, so when
people gohome they can smell the
scent and they remember other
things about Westin hotels," Krishna
said. "So, they are using this research
to say, 'Look if you give scented prod-
ucts for your patrons to take home
they'll remember your hotel better.'"

campus goes on to impact lives all around the world. Here are twelve of the best ideas to come from the University in the past year.

As the recent fiasco in the Gulf of Mexico
illustrated, it's slow work getting oil out
of a large body of water. But a group of
researchers at the University might have a
quicker solution.
Working alongside two of his students,
Material Science and Engineering Prof.
Anish Tuteja has developed a method of
extracting oil from water that his research
team only half-jokingly refers to as a
"gigantic strainer."
Tuteja's work involves a "dip-coding"
process in which commercially available
porous materials like cloth or polyester
fabrics are covered in a thin layer of the
artificial membrane that Tuteja and his
researchers have been perfecting since
last October.
The membrane then acts as a strainer,
holding back oil while enabling water to
pass through.
"It's water-loving and oil-hating at
the same time," Arun Kota, one of the

researchers on the project, said of the arti-
ficial membrane.
According to Tuteja, the idea of oil-
water separation is completely counterin-
tuitive.
"Take any surface in nature and if you
put water through it, oil will come too,"
Tuteja said. Nevertheless, "the idea was
there as to what we thought might work,
and the proof was really to show that it
works."
Tuteja's membrane involves a mixture
of two elements: an oil-repellant nanopar-
ticle and a "water-loving" plastic.
"We have to mix them in the right
quantity that it can pull the water down
but push the oil up," Tuteja said.
Tuteja and his researchers searched for
that ideal balance through a months-long
process of trial and error.
According to Kota, the membrane is
now almost flawless, with recent tests
extracting 99% oil from oil-water mix-
tures.

However, the technology has yet to
tested outside of a small laboratory s
ting.
As Tuteja explained, larger-scale te
can only occur once the technology ga
visibility.
To that end, Tuteja and his team p
to publish the results of their research i
"high-impact journal" and have also fi
a patent, Tuteja said.
Tuteja said he hopes the "dip-codin
process can be used to aid situations li
the recent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexic
As Tuteja pointed out, massive quan
ties of oil from the Gulf spill sank bene
the surface of the ocean and merged w
the water, giving the appearance of a cle
surface.
"On the surface the ocean looks cle
but underneath there's plumes and pluu
of this oil-water mixture," Tuteja sa
"Right now all they're doing is skimmi
the top."
But Kota said the new membrane c

u a Automobiles serve as means of transporta-
led tion from point A to point B. But is that all
they can be used for?
g" "If you could use a car for something
ike more than just getting to work or going on
ao. a family vacation, it would be a whole dif-
nti- ferent way to think about a vehicle," Engi-
ath neering professor Jeff Stein wrote in a press
ith release.
an Stein serves as project director of a team
of 10 other University professors who are
an, collaborating on a four-year mission -
nes with funding awarded from the National
?id. Science Foundation - to reinvent the way
lng we think about the automobile.
"We're trying to develop mathematical-
'an based tools that will help people be able to
design the future vehicles so that they get
good mileage, get good range, make good
use of the electricity...and try to reduce the
amount of pollution that is produced," he
said.
Oneof Stein's research projects is a
concept called vehicle-to-grid integration.
Stein's team is looking at tapping into a
vehicle's potential to store and feed electric-
ity back into the grid even while the vehicle
sits idle in the garage.
Right now, the electrical grid - what
we plug everything from a microwave to a
laptop into - operates in an "on demand"
system. That is, the electricity utilities only
create the exact amount of energy needed
ate at the time they are being used. However,
if there are a lot of vehicles that are sitting
in garages, all with large batteries that store
electrical energy, Stein believes they could
temporarily store energy to be used at a
nd later time to power other types of electric-
iate ity.
ht) Stein labels unpredictable energy, like
y wind and solar energy, "intermittent ener-
h gy" because it occurs sporadically in large
spurts. Stein thinks energy created during
the these spurts could be transferred to and
stored in large car batteries to be used later,
eri. rather than simply going to waste since it
ut is not needed at that specific time. It could
then be transferred to the electrical grid to
ally power microwaves and laptops.

"The vehicles we have now provide free-
dom and meet the needs of individuals,"
Stein said in the press release. "(Hybrid and
electric vehicles) can be a completely dif-
ferent way of using a car, to be something
that is defined as being a part of the greater
good in concert with others. It has fascinat-
ing possibilities."

MICROCONTROLLERS
Ambiq Micro, a startup company founded
by University graduates and professors, has
recently gained national attention for its
work that could potentially usher in a new
era in computing.
The company's co-founders - Ross
graduates Scott Hanson, David Landman
and Philip O'Neil and Engineering profes-
sors Dennis Sylvester and David Blaauw -
have developed what they call the world's
most energy-efficient microcontroller. They
believe this new technology will complete-
ly transform the way users interact with
computers in an everyday environment.
"Microcontrollers - or MCU's - you
can think of them as a scaled down ver-
sion of the microprocessors you would find
inside your laptops," O'Neil said in a pre-
sentation about the new microcontrollers at
Rice University. "MCUs are used in many
different applications that we interact with
on a daily basis, from our cell phones to
our watches to our cars. And although they
are becoming more pervasive over time,
we believe that the next five to 10 years
is where we're really going to see them
become ubiquitous."
The company's founders say that, while
current computing is on a one to one ratio
- where users interact with computers on
a personal level with a handheld device or a
laptop - the future will see computing in a
much more advanced scale, with micropro-
cessors installed in items anywhere from
the paint on our walls to the clothes on our
backs.
As part of that future, Ambiq Micro
believes there will be a need for smaller,
more energy-efficient microprocessors like
the company's microcontrollers.
The company's energy-efficient micro-
controllers will also greatly increase the
battery life of the products in which they
are used, an innovation that has not yet been
seen in the market of microprocessors.

In the initial stages of research for the
microcontroller, the team focused on very
small chips that measured one millimeter
or less, but Ambiq Micro is now focusing
on more commercially profitable markets
with designs that are more robust, Blaauw
said.
These new microprocessors could soon
provide a low-power alternative for compa-
nies, but the chip is still in the commercial
prototype stage and in the testing phase of
production.
Blaauw and Sylvester began the research
that eventually grew into Ambiq Micro in
2003, focusing on creating an energy-effi-
cient microcontroller that provides a new
level of power reduction for various tech-
nologies, including products used in the
medical field and by credit card companies.
They officially founded Ambiq Micro in
2009.
The idea gained momentum, Blaauw
said, in 2008 when the MIT Technology
Review did a general report on the team's
innovative low-power research with micro-
processors.
The success of the company has only
increased in the past year. The company's
innovations earned first place in the Michi-
gan Business Challenge in February, along
with a prize of $27,000 in cash grants.
Ambiq Micro also won the DFJ Mercury
Tech Transfer Investment Prize at the 2010
Rice Business Plan Competition, earning a
total of $54,000 in prize money and placing
fifth in the competition.
Although there are other microcon-
trollers that are now available to consum-
ers, Blaauw believes that Ambiq Micro
could "open up new markets" by offering
a technology that has never yet been seen.

The increased threat of terrorist attacks has
led to expanded, though imperfect, secu-
rity measures everywhere from airports to
sporting arenas. But a new development in
security could provide a hidden and imme-
diate way to detect potential suicide bomb-
ers, even in the largest crowds.

During his final semester at the Univer-
sity last year, recent Engineering graduate
Ashwin Lalendran developed a system of
wireless sensors, or units, that can detect
Improvised Explosive Devices - explo-
sives often used in suicide bombings - and
transmit the data to authorities.
Lalendran worked for six months on the
project - which was funded by the Air
Force Research Lab at the Wright-Patterson
Air Force base in Dayton, Ohio - as part
of a class taught by Atmospheric, Oceanic
and Spaces Sciences Prof. Nilton Renno.
"It's an innovative solution for secu-
rity personnel to detect IEDs in a heavily
crowded environment, such as an airport,
where there is a constant flow of people,"
Lalendran said. "It's a form of standoff
detection, for when you can't physically
search every person."
Lalendran worked to create about 20
wireless units with the ability to scan for
"unusual contents in metals." The units,
which would be placed about 10 feet apart
from one another when in use, could then
process the information in real time to
detect these suspect values in metals.
The sensors are not only cost-effective,
Lalendran says, but also small enough to fit
in the palm of a hand, and therefore pos-
sible to hide within ordinary items like
traffic cones. Officials could easily hide
the units to remain undetected by would-be
bombers.
The sensors could potentially play a
significant role in security forces and have
even been considered for use in military
defense. Lalendran offered the example of
placing sensors in polling stations in places
like Iraq and Afghanistan to help prevent
suicide bomb attacks.
"The IED problem is a really big issue,"
he said. "We are losing a lot of men and
women because we can't detect IEDs, and I
feel that this technology could help out with
this specific issue."

remittance funds-money that migrant
workers send home to their families while
partaking in jobs outside their home coun-
try. This money plays a big role in the eco-
nomic development of a country, but little is
known about how to best utilize these funds
for maximum economic growth.
Many economists even speculate that
remittances could be detrimental to a
country, because many of the families that
receive the money from migrants begin
to lose incentive to work, or that they use
the money for short-term needs rather than
long-term investments that would do more
for the development of the country.
But according to Ford School of Public
Policy Prof. Dean Yang, these remittances
can actually be used more efficiently and
yield greater advancements for the country
if migrant workers exhibit greater control
over the way the money is spent, rather than
leaving it up to their families.
To test his hypothesis, Yang embarked
on a field study in which different mem-
bers of a group of migrant workers from El
Salvador were placed under varying finan-
cial conditions. Some were offered savings
accounts that allowed for greater control
over how their families were using the
money, others were provided a joint savings
account with their families back home to
increase spending monitoring, and the last
group had no financial guidance.
The results of the study proved that
when migrants had more control over the
money they sent home, their savings greatly
increased, ultimately allowing for more
long-term investment use.
"What this reveals is the first hard, sci-
entific evidence that this idea of giving
migrants more control over how remit-
tances are used potentially can have some
kind of development impact," Yang said.
"It gives migrants more control over how
remittances are used, and to exercise that
control so that more of that money sent
home does end up getting allocated to pur-
poses and they're more likely to have the
long run development impact."
Yang says most migrant workers tend to
want their money to be spent on more long-
term investments-like schooling, health-

care and small business ventures-but that
in many situations, families use the money
for more short-termnecessitieslike grocer-
ies and household bills. Because of this, a
migrant may send less money back home,
ultimately bringing less money to the home
country and limiting that country's eco-
nomic development.
"Migrants certainly realize that even
though they state a preference for the
money to be used for education or small
enterprise investments, they know that they
can't really control how the money is used,"
Yang said. "They probably send less money
home in total than if they did have the abil-
ity to control how the money was used and
allocated once it arrived home."

There has been much debate over plans to
install wind turbines on the shores of Lake
Michigan. But what if those turbines were
shoved under water? Juniors Tarun Koshy
and Nicholas Williams have proposed just
that. The two want to harness the currently
unused power of Michigan lakes and rivers
by installing large-scale underwater tur-
bines.
Inspired by a Discovery Channel spe-
cial he saw as a high school freshman,
Koshy decided to research the feasibility
of extracting energy from underwater cur-
rents. The increase in investment in clean
energy and the fact that Michigan is full of
bodies of water also convinced Koshy and
Williams that underwater turbines could
prove successful in Michigan.
"Michigan's known so much for its
water," Koshy said. "Why not use what's
right in front of us?"
Not to be confused with water turbines,

underwater turbines do not require the con-
struction of dams. They work on the same
principles as wind turbines but use moving
water to turn the propellers, which can gen-
erate much more power than wind turbines.
Underwater currents produce up to 840
times the energy density of wind,according
to Hydro Green Energy, a company that is
currently developing a similar idea.
Additionally, water currents are con-
stant, unlike the sporadic nature of wind,
making them much more reliable. And they
don't present an eyesore to the communities
where they're installed. "People don't want
wind farmsanywhere close to their homes,"
Koshy said.
A version of the underwater turbine idea
is already in production in Norway and in
the Hudson River in New York. The single
turbine in Norway produces enough energy
to fully power 37 homes, while the New
York turbine powers a supermarket and
parking garage.
Despite concerns that the propellers
could negatively alter ecosystems, the actu-
al impact on wildlife has been found to be
extremely low. After scientists tagged fish
in the Hudson River within a 50-mile radi-
us of the turbine, they concluded that most
were smart enough to avoid the underwater
turbine, according to a study funded by the
New York City government.
Koshy and Williams debuted their idea
at the statewide Motivate Michigan compe-
tition, in which participants proposed plans
to energize Michigan's slumping economy.
The pair took top honors and a $20,000
scholarship. Motivate Michigan liked the
idea so much that next year's competition
will ask students to develop a business plan
to implement underwater turbines in Michi-
gan.
