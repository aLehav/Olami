CAMPUS LIFE
TEDxUofM returns for fourth year

Day-long
'Untapped-' event
to feature 21
speakers
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily Staff Reporter
TEDxUofM will once again
allow students, faculty and staff
to share knowledge at its fourth
annual conference Friday.
The day-long lineup of 21
University-affiliated speakers at
the Power Center is based on the
theme Untapped-.

"Untapped- basically means
to look around and look inside
yourself and see what stories
need to be told," Engineering
junior Maria Young said. "It
means to find your passion and
your fire and then give it to as
many people as possible."
TEDxUofM is an indepen-
dently organized spin-off of
the popular series by non-prof-
it Technology, Entertainment
and Design, where scientists,
designers, engineers and other
scholars give 18-minute pre-
sentations on innovative ideas
they have.
Though the event is already
at its cap of 1,200 attendees, a

live stream will be available at
Hatcher Graduate Library, the
Duderstadt Center and Hillel, as
well as on the TEDxUofM web-
site.
Young, a co-director of the
event, said planning for the
event started soon after the
completion of the 2012 events,
adding that the dynamic of the
day itself has alot to do with the
team putting it together.
"TED U of M is interesting
becau se people on the team
take on as much responsibility
as they'd like, so it becomes alot
more meaningful experience for
everyone because they all want
to do the work that they do,"

Young said.
Young said the speakers
will incorporate the theme in
their lectures and it's meant to
"extend the spirit and the ener-
gy past one day."
LSA senior Surya Nagara-
ja, also a co-director, said he
believes TEDxUofM is popular
with students because it fuels
their desire for sharing stories
and new ideas and is more inter-
active than learning from text-
books and exams.
"Michigan is such a progres-
sive place and people want to
experience things they never
have before," he said. "TED
Talks are a great way to get

outside your box and do that
because the speakers are all so
dynamic; you can't helpbut have
your mind blown."
Nagaraja said. TEDxUofM
differs from the original TED
Talks because it's University-
specific.
"If you go to the talks and
there's a professor that just
really speaks to you, you can go
meet them because they work
here, and she walked the same
halls as you; there's no reason
you couldn't do what she does,"
Nagaraja said.
Business senior Jeremy Kla-
ben, ateam leader for the confer-
ence, said the University event is

unique because it's a "collabora-
tion of the Leaders and Best from
across the University," highlight-
ing their passions.
"Basically we provide a stage
and the speakers take it from
there," Klaben said.
Klaben said TEDxUofM,
which is in its fourth year at the
University, lends itself to the
campus because of its interdis-
ciplinary nature.
"It's so different than any-
thing that anyone will experi-
ence because as you listen, you
reflect on things you haven't
thought of before, and you leave
feeling really inspired and ready
to do things."'

LEADERSHIP
Students to participate

Leaders of campus
non-profit to trade
* ideas with other
student leaders
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily News Editor
While many students are trav-
eling to Atlanta this weekend to
cheer on the men's basketball
team in their first Final Four
appearance in 20 years, two Wol-
verines will head farther west
to represent the University in a
slightly different setting.
LSA senior Meaghan
O'Connor and LSA junior Eliza-
beth Rich will leave for Wash-
ington University in St. Louis,
Mo. Friday to attend the Clinton
Global Initiative University, a
weekend-long conference hosted

by former President Bill Clinton
and his daughter Chelsea Clin-
ton which brings hundreds of
college students and world lead-
ers together to try to solve global
problems.
The pair will attend CGIU
as members of She's the First, a
national non-profit organization
that raises money to send under-
privileged girls to school around
the world. O'Connor founded the
University's chapter of the club
in the fall after working for the
organization last summer in New
York.
At the conference, O'Connor
and Rich - along with two other
woman involved in She's the
First in different states - will
meet with other college students
who have made a "Commitment
to Action" including climate
change, public health and edu-
cation, which is O'Connor's and
Rich's focus.

"What you get out of the local
stuff is really cool, and what we
do here is really cool," O'Connor
said. "(But) that national per -
spective is so different than what
we do here."
"A big part of the summit this
weekend is talking and connect
ing to people who have a common
interest," Rich added.
Last semester, the Univer-
sity's club raised enough money
to send two girls in Guatemala to
high school. As evidenced by tl
club's name, the girls will be the
first in their families to attend.
The hope is that by attaining a
higher level of education a cycle
of poverty can be interrupted.
Though one aspect of the orga-
nization is to send girls to school,
another is to empower students
on campuses across the nation.
While students may not neces-
sarily have money to donate, she

Leading (Michigan) man

Starring in roles such as
The Phantom and Raoul in
"The Phantom of the Opera,"
Doug LaBrecque, who earned
his master's degree from the
University in 1988, has. per-
formed in numerous produc-
tions throughout his career.
Recently making his Carnegie
Hall debut as a soloist with
the New York Pops, LaBrecque
has continued to perform solo
among some of the world's top
symphony orchestras.
Are there any experiences
you had during your time
as a student that you use in
your career today?
I had a sound vocal tech-

nique taught by Music Prof.
Leslie Guinn, and I was very
prepared for auditions in New
York City because of the class-
es taught by Brent Wagner
and Jerry DePuit.
What is your favorite show
that you have performed in?
My best answer is always
the show that I am cur-
rently in. With that said, I
loved being a part of Harold
Prince's Broadway produc-
tion of the great American
musical "Show Boat." Watch-
ing a Broadway legend bring
to life an American classic
was certainly a highlight. I
also really enjoyed sharing

the stage with Marvin Ham-
lisch at Carnegie Hall, Bos-
ton Pops, Chicago Symphony
and orchestras throughout
America.
Whatisthe most gratifying
aspect of your career?
Having the opportunity to
stand onstage with so many
skilled musicians and share
music with diverse audiences
around the globe. I feel so for-
tunate to make a living enjoy-
ing what I love doing. Settling
into a concert career has pro-
vided me with what I have
always been seeking: balance.

It also came at an especially
embarrassing time for the NCAA,
with the country focused on the
Final Four basketball tournament
this weekend.
Rice,inhis third seasonwiththe
ScarletKnights, apologized outside
his home in Little Silver, N.J.
"I've let so many people
down: my players, my adminis-
tration, Rutgers University, the
fans, my family, who's sitting in
their house just huddled around
because of the fact their father
was an embarrassment to them,"
he said. "I want to tell every-
body who's believed in me that
I'm deeply sorry for the pain and
hardship that I've caused."
Athletic Director Tim Pernetti
was given a copy of the tape by a
former employee in November
and, after an independent investi-
gator was hired to review it, Rice
was suspended for three games,
fined $75,000 and ordered to
attend anger management class-
es. University President Robert
Barchi agreed to the penalty.
Pernetti initially said Tues-
day he and Barchi viewed the
video in December. The president
issued a statement Wednesday,
saying he didn't see it until Tues-
day and then moved to fire the
44-year-old coach for repeated
abusive conduct.Through aschool
spokesman, Pernetti backed up his
president and said Barchi did not
view the video until this week.
"Yesterday, I personally
reviewed the video evidence,
which shows a chronic and
pervasive pattern of disturb-
ing behavior," Barchi said in a
statement. "I have now reached
the conclusion that Coach
Rice cannot continue to serve
effectively in a position that
demands the highest levels of
leadership, responsibility and
public accountability. He can-
not continue to coach at Rutgers
University."

MPG focus of competition

Supermileage
club to race in
Ecomarathon
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily News Editor
Think aPrius's 48 miles pergal-
lon is efficient? Try over 3,000 mpg.
The University's Supermile-
age team - an entirely student-
run organization aiming to build
a high-efficiency vehicle - will
compete in the Shell Ecoma-
rathon in Houston, Texas from
April 5 to April 7 in the hopes of
winning the title of the most fuel-
efficient internal combustion
concept car in North America.
Starting with just a lawn
mower engine, the 25-person
team modified and tuned its
carbon-fiber vehicle before leav-
ing for the competition Tues-
day where it will face 140 other
teams from high schools and col-
leges across the United States.
"It's all about fuel economy,"
said Engineering senior Caro-
line Lupini, the team's project
manager. "We set a goal of 3,300
miles to the gallon."
The competition is split into
two classes. The University's
team will compete in the Pro-
totype classification, meaning
the car focuses solely on maxi-

mum fuel efficiency. There is
also an UrbanConcept classifica-
tion, where street-legal cars are
designed for more practical pur-
poses and passenger comfort.
At the competition, teams will
prove how far they can travel on
one liter of fuel.
Founded in 2010, the team
has appeared in just one previ-
ous competition - last year's
SAE Supermileage Competition
in Marshall, Mich. Still, Lupini
said she is confident the team can
break the current North Ameri-
can record of 3,169 mpg.
"Our goal remains the same
as it was last year because we
weren't able to achieve it," Lupi-
ni said. "(But) I'd like to assume
that we will."
The team receives funding
through the College of Engineer-
ing and various industry and
local sponsors. Though money
hasn't been an issue so far for the
club, Lupini said without dona-
tions the team wouldn't be able
to build a car of the same quality.
Engineering junior John
Rockwell, the team's race strat-
egy officer, said after all of the
time and effort the team mem-
bers have put into building and
testing their prototype, he wants
to get the result the team was
unable to achieve last year.
The team's car weighs more
than 200 pounds and should be
4

one of the lightest cars at the
competition - an advantage over
the other teams, said Rockwell.
A student of mechanical engi-
neering, Rockwell said Super-
mileage has allowed him to get
the hands-on experience he
would only be able to get through
summer internships.
"I think what we're doing is
huge," he said. "Every car now is
trying to get 30, 40, maybe even
50 miles to the gallon, and I defi-
nitely think that's where every-
thing is going ... it's cool to be on
the leading edge of that stuff."
In additionto the enginebody
and race strategy groups on the
team, members also hold busi-
ness and communications posi-
tions. Rockwell said working
closely with different types of
people as well as professors and
other professionals has provided
him and the rest of the team with
a unique experience.
"There's a lot of stuff I've
learned on this team that I
wouldn't be able to normally," he
said. "Working with companies
and sponsors ... you definitely
don'tgetthatjustsittinginaclass."
Engineering junior Andy Dun,
the team's engine lead, said he's
excited about the competition.
"Once we have everything
and everything's running it feels
great," Dun said. "I'm looking
forward to seeingthe result."

Authorities are hoping that

Louis Taylor broke down in

how he spent his first hours of
freedom after more than 40
years in prison for a hotel fire
that killed 29 people: an evening
hike and some fast food.
He struggled to operate what
he called an "Apple telephone"

Taylor was released Tuesday
after doubts about his convic-

Weak reports on hiring and
service industries sent the stock
market sharply lower Wednesday,
giving the Dow Jones industrial
average its worst day in more than
a month.
The Dow fell 11L66 points, or
0.8 percent, to 14,550.35, its worst
decline since Feb. 25. The Stan-
dard & Poor's 500 index dropped
16.56 points, or 1.1 percent, to
1,553.69. Both indexes closed at
record highs the day before.
The stock market started 2013
with a rally as investors became
more optimistic about the U.S.
economy, especially housing and
jobs. The reports Wednesday dis-
appointed the market and came
two days after news that U.S.
manufacturing growth slowed
unexpectedlylast month.
The losses were widespread.
All 10 industry groups in the S&P

500 index fell. Banks and energy
stocks had the worst losses, 1.7
percent and 1.6 percent. Utilities,
which investors hold when they
want to play it safe, fell the least,
0.3 percent.

North Korean leader Kim Jung Un gathered legislators Monday for an annual spring parliamentary session, one day
after party officials adopted a statement declaring building nuclear weapons one of the nation's top priorities.
Noth Korea warns military
cleared to attack U.S.

Pentagon will send
missile defense
system to Guam
SEOUL, South Korea (AP)
- Ratcheting up the rhetoric,
North Korea warned early
Thursday that its military has
been cleared to wage an attack
on the U.S. using "smaller,
lighter and diversified nucle-
ar" weapons.
The Pentagon, meanwhile,
said in Washington that it will
deploy a missile defense sys-
tem to the U.S. Pacific territory
of Guam to strengthen region-
al protection against a possible
attack from North Korea. The
defense secretary said the U.S.
was seeking to defuse the situ-
ation.
Despite the rhetoric, analysts
say they do not expect a nuclear
attack by North Korea, which
knows the move could trigger
a destructive, suicidal war that
no one in the region wants.

The strident warning from
Pyongyang is latest in a series
of escalating threats from
North Korea, which has railed
for weeks against joint U.S.
and South Korean military
exercises taking place in South
Korea and has expressed anger
over tightened sanctions for a
February nuclear test.
Following through on one
threat Wednesday, North
Korean border authorities
refused to allow entry to South
Koreans who manage jointly
run factories in the North
Korean city of Kaesong.
Washington calls the mili-
tary drills, which this time
have incorporated fighter jets
and nuclear-capable stealth
bombers, routine annual
exercises between the allies.
Pyongyang calls them rehears-
als for a northward invasion.
The foes fought on opposite
sides of the three-year Korean
War, which ended in a truce in
1953. The divided Korean Pen-
insula remains in a technical

state of war six decades later,
and Washington keeps 28,500
troops in South Korea to pro-
tect its ally.
U.S. Defense Secretary
Chuck Hagel said Washington
was doing all it can to defuse
the situation, echoing com-
ments a day earlier by Secre-
tary of State John Kerry.
"Some of the actions they've
taken over the last few weeks
present a real and clear dan-
ger and threat to the interests,
certainly of our allies, starting
with South Korea and Japan
and also the threats that the
North Koreans have leveled
directly at the United States
regarding our base in Guam,
threatened Hawaii, threatened
the West Coast of the United
States," Hagel said Wednesday.
In Pyongyang, the military
statement said North Korean
troops had been authorized to
counter U.S. "aggression" with
"powerful practical military
counteractions," including
nuclear weapons.

Conn. leaders in
the spotlight act as
national model
HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -
Connecticut lawmakers were
expected to approve sweeping
new restrictions on weapons
and large-capacity magazines
on Wednesday, a response to the
Newtown school shooting that
will give the state some of the
country's tightest gun control
laws.
The December massacre of
26 people inside Sandy Hook
Elementary School, which reig-
nited a national debate on gun
control, set the stage for changes
in the state that may have been
impossible elsewhere: The gov-
ernor, who personally informed
parents that their children had
been killed that day, championed
the cause, and legislative lead-
ers, keenly aware of the attention
on the state, struck a bipartisan
agreement they want to serve as
a national model.
"The tragedy in Newtown
demands a powerful response,
demands a response that tran-
scends politics," said Senate
President Donald E. Williams Jr.,
a Democrat. "It is the strongest
and most comprehensive bill in
the country."
The bill passed the Senate in a
bipartisan 26-10 vote following
a respectful and at times somber
six-hour debate Wednesday eve-
ning. The House of Representa-
tives then debated the bill and was
expected to vote later in the night.
Democratic Gov. Dannel P. Malloy
has said he would sign it into law.
The legislation adds more than
100 firearms to the state's assault
weapons ban and creates what
officials have called the nation's
first dangerous weapon offender
registry as well as eligibility rules

for buying ammunition. Some
parts of the bill would take effect
immediately after Malloy's sig-
nature, including background
checks for all firearms sales.
Connecticut will join states
including California, New York,
New Jersey and Massachusetts
in having the country's stron-
gest gun control laws, said Brian
Malte, director of mobilization for
the Brady Campaign to Prevent
Gun Violence in Washington.
"This would put Connecticut
right at the top or near the top of
the states with the strongest gun
laws," Malte said.
Colorado and New York also
passed new gun control require-
mentsinthewakeoftheNewtown
shooting, in which a 20-year-old
gunman used a military-style
semi-automatic rifle to kill 20
first-graders and six educators.
Compared with Connecticut's
legislation, which, for example,
bans the sale or purchase of
ammunition magazines holding
more than 10 rounds, New York
restricted magazines to seven
bullets and gave owners of high-
er-capacity magazines a year to
sell them elsewhere. Colorado
banned ammunition magazines
that hold more than 15 rounds.
"There are pieces that are
stronger in other states, but, in
totality, this will be the stron-
gest gun legislation passed in
the United States," Betty Gallo, a
lobbyist for Connecticut Against
Gun Violence, said of the Con-
necticut bill.
Many senators spoke of bal-
ancing the rights of gun owners
with addressing the horror of the
Sandy Hook shooting. Lawmak-
ers said they received thousands
of emails and phone calls urg-
ing them to vote for or against
the bill, with veteran Sen. Joan
Hartley, a Democrat, saying she's
never seen a more polarizing
issue at the state Capitol.

Coding for success
University should introduce more creative interdisciplinary courses
The New York Times published an article recognizing the
pervasion of computer science into college curriculum.
Arguments reference the need for "elements of computa-
tional thinking" in all careers and majors. Wheaton College in Mas-
sachusetts offers a course called "Computing for Poets." The subtext
reads: "a love of the written (and digital) word." Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh offers "Principles of Computation" for
those not in the major itself. This reflects an effort to develop skills
in technological literacy, an ever more important skill. The Univer-
sity should take a more integrative perspective in its approach in
offering the hard sciences - one that could also appeal to those stu-
dents outside these majors.

For the second year in a
row, the elections for Cen-
tral Student Government
ended without
a clear winner.
While forUM's
presidential
candidate ChrisT
Osborn and vice
presidential
candidate Hay-
ley Sakwa, both
LSA juniors, TIMOTHY
were ahead by BURROUGHS
485 votes at
the time polls
closed on March 29, it was too
early to declare victory.
With only about a fifth of students
voting, the integrity of the CSG elec-
tions is constantly under question.
As a result, CSG implemented a
new, stricter election code requir-
ing specific punishments following
violations. Included in the code are
rules regarding campaign donations,
which are intended to prevent any
individual or party from winning
because of access to significantly
greater funding. It's the responsibil-
ity of the University Election Com-
mission, a third-party organization,
to establish the guilt of accused par-
ties or candidates, while the Central
Student Judiciary hears appeals.
The UEC disqualified Osborn and
Sakwa after finding that Osborn, on
multiple occasions, influenced stu-
dents who were in the process of vot-
ing. This resulted in four major CSG
election code violations, and the can-
didates were assessed a total of eight
demerits, which exceeds the limit
of four demerits per person allowed
before disqualification. Additionally,
the forUM party was assessed eight
demerits for accepting donations
from Osborn and Sakwa for $300
each, double the $150 per-individual
limit. Ten demerits total are required
for a party to be disqualified.
Many are frustrated with the
election results and later disqualifi-
cations. A Michigan Daily editorial

claimed that the sole purpose of the
charges brought against Osborn
and Sakwa, one filed by youMICH
and the other filed jointly by you-
MICH and momentUM, "seemed
solely intent on preventing them
from taking office, pending an
appeal." However, both complaints
were filed with the UEC prior to
the results becoming public. The
editorial also belittles the signifi-
cance of the campaign infractions
and only questions the other par-
ties' motivation to pursue these
violations. Everyone involved has a
vested interest in the results of the
elections and clearly many motives
are at play at once. However, all
those involved, including the Daily,
should not lose sight of the impor-
tance of protecting the CSG elec-
tion process's integrity.
The Compiled Code offers clear
and straightforward guidelines
on how student campaigns should
operate. It's the responsibility of
those running for CSG positions,
especially president and vice presi-
dent, to do their due diligence and
understand these rules. The edito-
rial and many commenters have
stressed the importance of CSG on
campus and its relationship with
the University. The Daily edito-
rial claims that "the election and
resulting drama embarrass more
than impress (the administration)."
Tensions clearly are running high
between parties, but the "drama"
of ensuring fair elections is para-
mount to CSG's existence.
Additionally, much has been made
of youMICH's role in the investiga-
tion process. Many have questioned
the party's motives since they have
the most to gain from Osborn and
Sakwa's disqualification - their
candidates Business and LSA junior
Michael Proppe and LSA sophomore
Bobby Dishell came in second and
will take office if the potential appeal
fails. The role of youMICH does
raise a serious question surround-
ing enforcement with violations. The

editorial proposes the creation of a
third-party organization to police
the elections. By creating a redun-
dant committee operating under the
UEC, CSG would only overcompli-
cate and muddle the system already
in place.
By letting parties
police themselves
and each other, they
ensure compliance.
By letting parties police them-
selves and each other, they ensure
a high level of compliance. Parties
would want to avoid the type of pub-
lic humiliation and negative atten-
tion forUM has received. They're
motivated to follow the rules, while
also making certain the compliance
of others. This effectively cleans up
the election process and allows the
deserving candidates to win. Finally,
by actually disqualifying a winning
ticket, the UEC has also established
the precedent of ridged enforcement
and harsh punishments, which will
encourage all parties to abide by the
policies in the future.
The prompt seating of the next
CSG president is overshadowed by
the importance of ensuring the cred-
ibility of the election and its win-
ner. Furthermore, this controversy
shows that the new election code is
effective and working and is prevent-
ing individuals from tampering and
manipulating the process. While the
disqualification ofOsborn and Sakwa
is disappointing on many levels, dem-
onstrating that CSG takes itself and
its election process seriously will
only encourage students and the Uni-
versity to do the same.

It's the responsibility of the University to
offer relevant courses, but they also need to be
accessible and welcoming. All too often LSA
students are turned off by the thought of tak-
ing science classes because of concerns that
they might not have the necessary background
in these subjects. Headlines over the past three
years have noted the lack of grade inflation -
and possibly increased deflation - in science,
technology, engineering and math majors.
There's an observed 40- to 60-percent major-
dropout rates from engineering, meaning that
about half of those intending on an engineering
major ended up switching out. These figures
could be compensated by a program that part-
ners LSA with the Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science Department in the College
of Engineering. The program would develop
a curriculum that engages, encourages and
intrigues those outside of engineering fields.
Chemistry 215 double honors is an example of
this. The final project involves coding a web-
site to represent an organic molecular mecha-
nism. Across campus, students would benefit
by learning technological methods, literacy and
thinking, if integrated into curricula.
Technological skills are a needed bonus in

the job market. Computer-related occupations,
in general, pay an average of $73,710 according
tothe BureauofLabor Stastics. Entrylevel sala-
ries for computer science positions have grown
the fastest and according to U.S. News, four of
the "top 10 Best Jobs" relate directly to comput-
er science. Literacy in coding is a desirable skill
for an increasing array of professions. In order
to cultivate the entrepreneurial spirit promoted
all over the Diag, students need to be equipped
with the tools to do so.
Moreover, the University needs more inter-
disciplinary focus around campus. Students
of all disciplines could benefit from such
intertwined learning. By sharing knowledge
between disciplines, students could gain a
far broader exposure than they would in iso-
lated majors. Expanding cores to include such
"exposure" classes, or changing curricula to
incorporate such elements could encourage
this kind of preparation.
The University should take the example of
other colleges and develop courses that give
students a broader skill base. University stu-
dents of the future will need a more expansive
toolset; one that includes the tools for the
online world.

DRAKE BAGLIETTOI "-
Hand Up, hands on

Why has Michigan's unemployment rate
remained so high in spite of the many efforts
made to lower it? Most news sources attribute
it to problems in Washington D.C., a lack of
bipartisanship or the weather, depending on
the day. The true reason behind it, however,
was touched upon by Michigan Gov. Rick
Snyder earlier in 2012, when he discussed
how there has been too much emphasis on a
four-year degree and not enough on vocation-
al training. However, the true costs of this
dismissal of vocational training have not fully
been examined. In order to do so, it's neces-
sary to explore the cycle of poverty.
People are impoverished for a plethora of
reasons, but many can be distilled into two
groups. The firstbeingthose that weren't able
to receive the education necessary to become
an active member of the working community
- be that training in the traditional academic
forum or informally on the job. The second
group of individuals are those that they aren't
willing to put in the effort necessary to find
and maintain gainful employment.
It's this latter group that receives most of
the media attention when unemployment is
concerned, which limits the scope of govern-
ment action to benefit this group. Unfortu-
nately, it's impossible to convince someone
who doesn't want to work - even when their
life depends upon it - to do so. Thus, this
intervention is rendered inadequate by the
very nature of the people it's trying to benefit.
By limiting the scope of the unemployment
conversation in this way, real solutions for the
former group are severely limited.
Snyder suggested that these individuals
go to vocational school. However, many of
these individuals are unable to do so because
of financial and temporal limitations. Since
there's no increase in employment, this idea

does nothing to solve the problem of the sys-
tem that didn't allow them to acquire the
skills necessary in the first place. Communi-
ties in which the majority of members are of
low socioeconomic status don't collect the tax
revenues necessary to improve the school dis-
tricts to the point where they would be able
to adequately provide the skills required for
employment. This lack of skill creates unem-
ployment, and the cycle continues. In order to
break this cycle it's necessary to provide an
opportunity for hardworking individuals to
find employment.
A group of University students has decided
to tackle the issue in a unique manner: voca-
tional internships. Calling themselves the
Hand Up Initiative, they have made a plan that
attempts to bridge the gap between the level of
skills required by employers and the skills that
the unemployed populace have by setting up
two-week sessions of on-the-job training. After
this period of time, they facilitate the hiring of
these individualsbythe companies who trained
them, or, if that is not an option, through anoth-
er company in the same field. They hope thatby
eliminating one of the main factors separating
industrious job seekers from semi-skilled labor
jobs,those who wishtowork buthave been pre-
vented from doing so by forces outside of their
control can take direct control of their future.
By learning skills, individuals can provide
not only monetary wealth for their families, but
also the wealth of knowledge that comes from
experience for their children. While this meth-
od is currently untested, it seems to be an inno-
vative take on an age-old problem. If carried out
in the correct manner, this has the potential to
seriously improve the unemployment situation
in Michigan.

As I walked across the Diag,
chalked-out slogans bom-
barded me from all direc-
tions. To myleft,
"youMICH"
incorporated
the brass Block
M twice like a
crossword puz-
zle. To my right,
"Vote forUM"
colorfully graced KEVIN
the cracked
sidewalk. A MERSOL-
morass of post- BARG
ers with memes,
"momentUM"
and more spanned the posting wall.
And a political party, youMICH,
released a YouTube video that many
students consider tobe racist. All of
this could mean only one thing: It
was campaign season for the Cen-
tral Student Government.
Candidates campaigned in ear-
nest soon after winter break and
until polls closed on March 29. They
advanced platforms that would ben-
efit the student body and mobilized
students to support them. Although
they pounded the pavement for
endorsements and Facebook "likes,"
ultimately only one measure of sup-
port counted - votes.
And in the voting booth, one pair
of candidates distinguished them-
selves from the rest: LSA juniors
Chris Osborn and Hayley Sakwa,
the presidential and vice presiden-
tial candidates of the forUM ticket,
respectively, swept the contest
by a margin of nearly 500 votes -
including mine.
However, they may have set them-
selves apart in another way - a more
squalid one.
Allegedly, Osborn and Sakwa
"influenced voters in four instanc-
es while they were filling ballots."
Because this type of influence vio-
lates the election code - a new code
implemented because of similar
misconduct seen in the March 2012
election - the University Elections
Commission decided to disqualify
the candidates from the election
pending appeal. The Central Stu-
dent Judiciary will review the case
this weekend and further investigate

whether or not the new code can
ensure clean elections.
If Osborn and Sakwa did vio-
late the election code to the extent
charged, CSJ should uphold the
UEC ruling and the candidates
shouldn't take office. The integrity
of the University's democratic pro-
cess depends on it. These actions
are highly unethical and sharply
deviate from the exemplary leader-
ship for which University students
are known. We shouldn't condone
these violations even if a plurality
of voters supported the candidates
or if we fear what the second place
candidates may do in office.
In fighting their case, the forUM
candidates face some fairly damning
photographic evidence. However, it
wouldn'tseemthat way gauging from
the reactions of the party and many
of its supporters. As one supporter
shared with me, "I highly doubt
four extra votes won them the elec-
tion, so it's a minor technicality, and
I don't believe we should let a minor
technicality prevent the University
from seeing a much bigger and better
change than youMICH offers."
I would note that this type of
influence is neither minor nor mere-
ly technical in nature; it gravely
encroachesupon anindividual'sright
to vote - the bedrock of democracy.
In addition, it most likely reflects a
broader political strategy that earned
the candidates far more than four
votes if the allegations are true.
Semantics aside, I find this sup-
porter's perspective deeply unset-
tling and problematic. It implies that
the ends justify the means, which I
deem morally reprehensible.
If acted upon, it would allow
candidates to have their cake and
eat it too. It would enable them to
celebrate a democratic process that
yields a favorable outcome; how-
ever, if the democratic protections
integral to that process threaten to
invalidate the outcome, they can
dispense of them. Unfortunately,
this is exactly how forUM seems to
hope it'll play out.
In an official response to the
UEC ruling, the party asserted,
"students ... will not stand for this
outrageous outcome. The voices of

3,413 students will be heard." Much
like the supporter I conversed with,
forUM tacitly accepts that, even
if Osborn and Sakwa grievously
violated the election code, their
plurality should override the con-
sequence of unethical conduct.
If Osborn and Sakwa
violated the election
code, the candidates
shouldn't take office.
Furthermore, many forUM sup-
porters are rallying against the UEC
decision to prevent what they most
fear: a youMICH administration.
Many other progressive student
leaders and I assume that the often-
reactionary youMICH candidates
would undermine progress towards
a more inclusive and diverse cam-
pus community. For example, you-
MICH stands against the Divest
and Invest campaign, which in part
calls on the University to divest
from the fossil fuel industry. This
and other stances have spurred stu-
dent leaders to keep youMICH out
of the president's office by petition-
ing the UEC decision.
A successful petition would do
more harm than good. If Osborn and
Sakwa lose their case on appeal, the
student body should accept the result
rather than meddle with the impar-
tial judiciary; it should trust the
democratic process to iron out any
discrepancies and that candidates
who sufficiently violate the election
code will face the consequence -
disqualification. Ultimately, the ends
don't justify the means.
Are forUM supporters willing to
deny a group political power know-
ing it will degrade the democratic
process? Their answer will help
define the landscape of future stu-
dent government elections and the
common understanding of ethics ,
in student leadership.

APPEAL
From Page 1A
and the Michigan Education
Association, presented enough
evidence to rule against throw-
ing out the case. Both sides will
now prepare for testimonies in
the coming weeks.
Dan Korobkin, a staff attor-
ney for ACLU of Michigan, said
the aim of the suit was not to
challenge the substance of right
to work - which limits unions'
rights to organize within work-
places - but rather to challenge
the "undemocratic and illegal
process that was used to enact

it."
The Open Meeting Act aims
"to protect your right to know
what's going on in government
by opening to full public view the
processes by which elected and
nonelected officials make deci-
sions on your behalf," according
to the legislation.
When right to work was passed
in December amid contention,
the Capitol Building in Lan-
sing was closed to the public for
safety reasons due to overcrowd-
ing, and there were reports that
legislative staffers occupied the
viewing gallery usually reserved
for the public. At the hearing,
Collette questioned Assistant

Attorney General Michelle Brya
about the building's closure to
the public and why legislative
staffers filled the public gallery.
Brya said the claimswere "inac-
curate," though Collette said it
was still "suspicious" and worth
debating as part of the lawsuit,
the Dfetroit Free Press reported.
Yearout declined to comment on
the viewing gallery issue.
Korobkin said the ACLU has
evidence to dispute the claim
that the Capitol was closed for
safety reasons.
"We have photos and videos
showing (the Capitol) was prac-
tically empty by 1 p.m.," Korob-
kin said. "So the idea that people

couldn't come inside because it
was too crowded is just not true."
Yearout said the Michigan
state police had to take some
steps that day to ensure the
health and safety of everyone
in the building. She added that
open meeting laws were not
violated, since all legislative
activities were broadcast live
on Michigan government televi-
sion and on the Internet, and the
media was present to report on
everything.
"Everything was out in the
open," Yearout said. "This did
not occur in the shadows. Every-
one had a full understanding of
what was going on."

believes the organization shows
anyone can make an impact
through hard work and creativ-
ity.
"I'm passionate not only about
girls in developing countries, but
girls here (as well), and convinc-
ing them that philanthropy and
giving back is really important,"
she said.

Though the club's signature
fundraising event is a tie-dye
cupcake bake sale, members can
take on other activities to raise
money. Rich, for example, is run-
ning a half marathon where any
sponsored money she receives
will be donated to the organiza-
tion. An upcoming gala will also
raise funds for the group.
In addition, both women will
continue to work on their indi-
vidual commitments in the com-
ing year. O'Connor works with

local girls to create beaded jew-
elry made out of recycled maga-
zines, a practice with roots in
Uganda. Rich is hosting a Read-
A-Thon next school year for local
girls. The raised money will be
used to sponsor another girl
abroad.
"I wanted to think outside the
box and have a different pur-
pose," Rich said.
And while O'Connor and Rich
already have a full plate, they said
one of the best things about the

CGIU weekend is the opportunity
to meet new people and get a dif-
ferent perspective.
"Just knowing that projects
have been started at this confer-
ence will hopefully inspire us

ORESTEIA
From Page 1A
around in 2008, but the perfor-
mance was pushed back until
2013withan anniversaryin mind.
"We decided we should just
wait until the centennial, since
the first part (of the trilogy) was
written in 1913," Kiesler said.
"The Oresteian Trilogy" con-
tains particular significance to
the University because of the
composer Milhaud's connection
with former Composition Prof.
William Bolcom.

Bolcom, who worked for the
University from 1973 to 2008, is
a world-renowned and Pulitzer
Prize-winning composer. Bol-
com studied with Milhaud in the
1950s, and it was because of Bol-
com's connection that the piece
was chosen.
Milhaud's three-piece opera is
based on the plays by Aeschylus
and tells the story of murder and
revenge of the Greek royal fam-
ily of Argos. In the narrative, the
mother kills her husband and
then the son kills his mother to
avenge his father's death. The
son ends up on trial for murder

but eventually walks free, with
the jury deciding that he was
merely defendinghis dead father.
Despite the story being an old
one, Kiesler insisted that themes
like class conflicts, power, gen-
der conflicts and jealousy still
ring true today.
But more important than
those themes is the trial that
takes place.
"It was the first trial ever,"
Kiesler said. "Before this, justice
was just revenge, an eye for an
eye, and a tooth for a tooth. But
at the end of the story, Athena
says to stop the revenge and that

they are going to have a trial and
an impartial jury to decide. She
lays out the rules for how a jury
should work."
With an intense plot and com-
plex music, the task of direct-
ing Milhaud's piece would seem
like a daunting feat, but Case
has full confidence in Kiesler's
abilities.
"He's one of the most incredi-
ble musicians I know," Case said.
"Music just comes out of him."
"Everyone's been working
really hard. In the end, we will
have an extraordinary perfor-
mance," Kiesler said.

Dementia tops cancer in expenses

New study details
cost of treating
Alzheimer's
(AP)-Cancer and heart
disease are bigger killers, but
Alzheimer's is the most expen-
sive malady in the U.S., costing
families and society $157 billion
to $215 billion a year, according
to a new study that looked at this
in unprecedented detail.,
The biggest cost of Alzheim-
er's and other types of demen-
tia isn't drugs or other medical
treatments, but the care that's
needed just to get mentally
impaired people through daily
life, the nonprofit RAND Corp.'s
study found.
It also gives what experts
say is the most reliable estimate
for how many Americans have
dementia - around 4.1 mil-
lion. That's less than the widely
cited 5.2 million estimate from
the Alzheimer's Association,
which comes from a study that
included people with less severe

impairment.
"The bottom line here is the
same: Dementia is among the
most costly diseases to society,
and we need to address this if
we're going to come to terms
with the cost to the Medicare
and Medicaid system," said Mat-
thew Baumgart, senior director
of public policy at the Alzheim-
er's Association.
Dementia's direct costs, from
medicines to nursing homes,
are $109 billion a year in 2010
dollars, the new RAND report
found. That compares to $102
billion for heart disease and $77
billion for cancer. Informal care
by family members and others
pushes dementia's total even
higher, depending on how that
care and lost wages are valued.
"The informal care costs are
substantially higher for demen-
tia than for cancer or heart con-
ditions," said Michael Hurd, a
RAND economist who led the
study. It was sponsored by the
government's National Institute
on Aging and will be published in
Thursday's New England Jour-

nal of Medicine.
Alzheimer's is the most com-
mon form of dementia and the
sixth leading cause of death in
the United States. Dementia also
can result from a stroke or other
diseases. It is rapidly growing
in prevalence as the population
ages. Current treatments only
temporarily ease symptoms and
don't slow the disease. Patients
live four to eight years on average
after an Alzheimer's diagnosis,
but some live 20 years. By age 80,
about 75 percent of people with
Alzheimer's will be in a nursing
home compared with only 4 per-
cent of the general population,
the Alzheimer's group says.
"Most people have understood
the enormous toll in terms of
human suffering and cost," but
the new comparisons to heart
disease and cancer may surprise
some, said Dr. Richard Hodes,
director of the Institute on Aging.
"Alzheimer's disease has a
burden that exceeds many of
these other illnesses," especially
because of how long people live
with it and need care, he said.

For the new study, researchers
started with about 11,000 people
in a long-running government
health survey of a nationally rep-
resentative sample of the popu-
lation. They gave 856 of these
people extensive tests to deter-
mine how many had dementia,
and projected that to the larger
group to determine a prevalence
rate - nearly 15 percent of people
over age 70.
Using Medicare and other
records, they tallied the cost
of purchased care - nursing
homes, medicines, other treat-
ments - including out-of-pocket
expenses for dementia in 2010.
Next, they subtracted spending
for other health conditions such
as high blood pressure, diabetes
or depression so they could isolate
the true cost of dementia alone.
"This is an important differ-
ence" from other studies that
could not determine how much
health care cost was attribut-
able just to dementia, said Dr.
Kenneth Langa, a University
of Michigan researcher who
helped lead the work.

Search for California hikers
Sfruitless; rescuers hopeful


Two lost in
Cleveland National
Forest Wednesday
RANCHO SANTA MAR-
GARITA, Calif. (AP) - Rescuers
working in sometimes danger-
ously rugged terrain combed
Southern California's Cleveland
National Forest for two lost hik-
ers late Wednesday, but the third
day of searching proved fruitless
as darkness fell.
There was no evidence of
foul play and authorities believe
the teens are in the area, in part
because a 911 call made before
their mobile phone died was
traced to a cell tower near the
location, said Orange County
Fire Authority Capt. John Muir.
"Their probability for survival
is good," he said, adding that the
nights have been mild and the
days not too hot. "We're not stop-
ping until we find them."
So far, nothing has been
found in the area where moun-

tamn bikers glimpsed what they
believed to be a light in heavy
brush Tuesday night off of a
trail, he said.
Several dozen people on the
ground and three helicopters
in the air looked for the pair
Wednesday. The overnight
search would be mostly the work
of a single helicopter, sheriff's Lt.
Jason Park said.
Nicholas Cendoya, 19, and
Kyndall Jack, 18, were last heard
from Sunday night when they
made the 911 call. The two are
believed to have gone off trail
near Holy Jim Trail, a tree-lined
dirt path along a creek that leads
to a waterfall and is popular with
day hikers.
In the call, they said they
were about a mile from their
car, which was parked at a
trailhead, but rescuers have
expanded the search.
"When you're disoriented
because you're out of breath
and tired and you think you're
one mile away, you could be
potentially three or four miles

away," Muir said. "There's a lot
of ground to cover."
It was unclear whether the
lost hikers carried water and
Kyndall's father, Russ Jack, said
he worried that after three days
the pair might be dehydrated.
But he still has hope.
"So at this point everybody's
still upbeat, optimistic about
finding the kids in good shape
and alive," he told TV reporters.
About 50 searchers, some on
horseback and aided by dogs,
moved back and forth through
chest-high brush across moun-
tain ridges.
Two search volunteers got
lost themselves Wednesday, but
a helicopter found them and
airlifted them out, Park said.
Two hikers unrelated to the
search also had to be helped
when at least one of them was
injured, Park said.
The U.S. Forest Service
gave permission to cut brush
on a mountain peak to land a
helicopter, which allowed LA
County sheriff's personnel and

two dogs to be taken to a can-
yon northwest of the pair's car,
Orange County sheriff's Lt.
Erin Guidice told the Los Ange-
les Times.
That area was chosen
because of the nearby cellphone
tower that picked up the 911
call, she said.
Four helicopters also
dropped search-and-rescue
teams in the forest all day
Wednesday, Muir said.
Jack's car was left in a park-
ing area. Her mother drew a
message on the dusty wind-
shield that read: "Kyndall - we
r looking wont stop love you
mom" and signed it with a
heart. Jack's family towed away
the car Tuesday night, KABC-
TV reported.
The area is in a section of the
national forest in the Santa Ana
Mountains, which lie along the
border of Orange and Riverside
counties southeast of Los Ange-
les. The trail ranges in elevation
from about 2,000 feet to about
4,000 feet.

Louisville guard upbeat
despite injury during game

Ware will
accompany his
teammates to final
four game in Atl.
LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -
Kevin Ware is pretty certain
how his next few months will
play out.
"After we win the national
championship," the injured
Louisville guard said with a
smile on his face, "I'm just look-
ing forward to rehab."
Ware is already set for his next
step, though he is gingerly walk-
ing around on crutches and with
his surgically repaired broken
leg in a cast up to his right knee:
He is heading to the Final Four.
Ware was cleared Wednes-
day by doctors to accompany
the Cardinals on their hour-
long flight to Atlanta. The
sophomore plans to be a full
participant in preparations for
Saturday's game against Wich-
ita State.
He said the overwhelming
support he has received has
helped him maintain his spirits
and strengthened his confidence
of a full recovery. He hopes by
next season to be helping the
Cardinals defend the nation-
al championship he believes
they'll win this weekend.
The normally reserved
20-year-old calmly recalled
how he felt when he suffered
the devastating injury, saying he
doesn't think Louisville would
be in the Final Four if he had lost
his composure.
Ware credits teammate Luke
Hancock for calming him down.
"He got me to that point

where I really had to put the
pain on hold," said Ware, with
his leg in a cast propped up on a
couch. "Once he said his prayer,
I was kind of thinking the whole
time, 'you can either be a cryba-
by about it or you're going to get
your team back and get them in
the right mindset'.
"Luke said his words, and I
just kept repeating, 'y'all gotta
go win this game.' I'm fine. ... It
really helped the team."
But it wasn't easy for the
Cardinals, many of whom cried
after seeing Ware's gruesome
injury - his bone protruding six
inches through his skin.
Even Louisville coach Rick
Pitino was emotional, wiping
tears from his eyes and later say-
ing that the sight of his player's
injury almost made him vomit.
But Pitino said everyone's
emotions have settled down
knowing that it appears Ware
will be OK.
"I think we're all fine now,"
Pitino said. "Just having Kevin
around, we can exhale."
The coach said having Ware in
Atlanta might provide the Cardi-
nals with alittle "extra emotion,"
but in his experience "the team
that executes the best will win."
Pitino and his son, Richard,
spent Monday at the hospital
with Ware, who was pictured
holding the championship tro-
phy in his bed. Though Ware
had maintained his composure
talking with AP, he became
very emotional during an ear-
lier interview with ESPN when
talking about waking up and
seeing the trophy.
The coach downplayed stay-
ing with him at the hospital
after his injury.
"There's not a coach in


America that wouldn't be
there," he said.
And while Pitino said every-
one can exhale now, the Cardi-
nals had to take a deep breath
when Ware went down on Sun-
day. They eventually regrouped
and took the lead at halftime
against Duke en route to an
85-63 victory over the Blue Dev-
ils in Indianapolis.
Through it all, Ware said
he had to remain strong. He
was placed on a stretcher and
wheeled out of Lucas Oil Sta-
dium to cheers of 'Kevin Ware,
Kevin Ware,' before heading to
Methodist Hospital.
Ware underwent a two-hour
operation to repair compound
fractures of the tibia that left the
leg at an odd angle. He awoke the
next morning to discover he had
become an overnight sensation,
and the afterglow hasn't waned.
His condition and progress
have been featured every day on
the major networks, the Inter-
net and especially social media.
The Cardinals' practice facility
was surrounded by a phalanx of
satellite trucks, and the inter-

Marquina has alleged that
Defense Minister Diego Molero
and National Guard Gen. Antonio
Benavides plan to use military
resources to intimidate voters,
especially those dependent on
government services, to cast bal-
lots for Maduro.
Maduro's campaign denies the
allegations andthere was no imme-
diate comment from the council.
But the controversy was almost
overshadowed in the press and
chatter in the street by Maduro's
latest move to draw an almost
religious connection to Chavez,
whom he served as foreign minis-
ter and vice president.

a song and the bird took flight,
circled around once and then
flew away, and I felt the spirit
and blessings of Commander
Hugo Chavez for this battle," said
Maduro, who interspersed his
remarks with sounds to simulate
the flapping of the bird's wings
and its whistle.
The message, delivered as he vis-
ited Chavez's hometown of Saba-
neta in southern Venezuela, was
intended for a national audience
of Chavistas that reveres the late
leader. It also fell in line with an
electoral strategyin which Maduro
repeatedly emphasizes his close
ties to Chavez, who tapped him as
hischosensuccessor.
But it prompted ridicule among
many of his opponents.
Many newspapers led their
campaign stories Wednesday
with Maduro's bird remarks. The
satirical website "El Chiguire
Bipolar" said the statement was
so strange that its own jokes could
not compete: "If you laugh, it's not
because of us."

Freshman guard Nik Stauskas looked like his old self against Florida, when he went 6-for-6 from beyond the 3-point line in Michigan's Elite Eight victory.
M iga n reurnin

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor
Trey Burke's game-tying shot
against Kansas, Nik Stauskas'
6-for-6 day from beyond the arc
against Florida, Mitch McGary
averaging a double-double in
the NCAA Tournament - the
Michigan men's basketball team
is finally hitting its stride.
After struggling through
the Big Ten slate and suffering
an early exit in the conference
tournament, the Wolverines
weren't expected to be the last
Big Ten team standing in late
March. Michigan finished the
regular season 6-6 after starting
out 18-0.
But in the NCAA Tourna-
ment, Michigan plowed through
tough second- and third-round
draws in South Dakota State and
Virginia Commonwealth and
advanced to its first Sweet Six-
teen appearance since 1994. A
late rally against the Jayhawks
and a drubbing of the Gators
propelled the Wolverines to
their first Final Four since 1993.
So why is Michigan finally
hot?
"Just coming into the (NCAA)
Tournament, we wanted to
make a statement our first cou-
ple of games," said sophomore
guard Trey Burke. "We just
tried to stay in the moment.
After the loss to Wisconsin (in
the Big Ten Tournament), we

as well as we should've played.
Coming into the NCAA Tourna-
ment, we wanted to come in and
make a statement from day one.
"Once we got past South
Dakota State, we focused on
VCU - we never really looked
ahead. We all did a really good
job focusing on everybody's
scouting report. That definitely
helped us out to this point."
The Wolverines have been
playing up to the potential that
was expected at the beginning
of the season, and a lot of it has
been because they've been able
to get back to playing their fast-
paced offense.
After Michigan cruised past
South Dakota State, it was faced
with slowing down a physical,
lanky VCU squad with a noto-
riously tough defense that likes
to force turnovers. As the top
team in the nation at forcing
turnovers, the Rams trouble
opposing teams' guards and shut
down passing lanes.
But the Wolverines didn't
have trouble handling the ball.
Though Burke was quiet offen-
sively, freshman forward Glenn
Robinson III and junior guard
Tim Hardaway Jr. took control,
and VCU was unable to defend
Michigan's multitude of ball
handlers.
Though the Wolverines didn't
have an issue dispatching the
Jackrabbits and the Rams, both
styles of olav were very differ-

team runs. It might be daunting
to have to scout teams with such
a quick turnaround, but Burke
and Michigan didn't think it
was a weakness of theirs head-
ing into the tournament.
"We try to use our conference
as strength going into this tour-
nament," Burke said. "Seeing
different defenses and offenses
- things that we're not famil-
iar with - allows us to get more
stops, get out in transition, play
our game."
That's exactly how Michigan
got to the Final Four. Against
Kansas, the Wolverines were
able to get out in transition by
forcing turnovers, helping fresh-
man forward Mitch McGary
control the boards.
The Wolverines duplicated
that against Florida in the Elite
Eight by jumping out to an early
13-0 lead and shutting down the
Gators defensively. Michigan's
defense held Florida to a 41-per-
cent clip and many one-and-
done possessions, which helped'
get its offense rolling.
The Wolverines scored 21
points in transition and forced
13 turnovers in the game, and
Burke found the shooters -
freshman guard Nik Stauskas
and Hardaway - early and
often.
"What helped us was getting
stops and running," Hardaway
said. "We really wanted to come
out there and be aggressive. he

We did that. Everybody was
on attack mode going into the
game. We really wanted to do
a good job on the defensive end
because they're a great 3-point
shooting team."
Now, Michigan is faced with
running its fast-paced offense
against Syracuse's seemingly
unbeatable 2-3 zone that held
Marquette to 39 points and
Indiana to 50. The zone's weak-
nesses haven't been exploited in
the tournament, but that doesn't
mean there aren't weak spots.
"There's some gaps in the
defense, high-low, low post,"_
McGary said. "If our guards
penetrate into those gaps in the
lane, it'll be easy kick-outs or
drop-offs for threes or layups."
And Michigan has confidence
in its shooters, especially with
Stauskas, who was left open
on the left-side baseline and
was automatic from the corner
against Florida.
Stauskas said Michigan coach
John Beilein has been preparing
the players to shoot long jump-
ers from anywhere on the floor
with a half-court drill. When-
ever a coach blows a whistle, the
player at the top of the key has
to take a deep 3-pointer - a way
to help prepare for Syracuse's
defense that can close out well
and stretch the floor.
"We have a lot of guys who
can shoot it from real deep, but,
coach Beilein made it a point: not
all of the threes we're gonna get
are right on the line," Stauskas
said. "But this week we're going
to spend a lot of time working on
threes maybe two, three, four
feet outside the line, knocking
down with confidence."

Barrett Franks: A Kiwi Wolverine

By JASON RUBINSTEIN
Daily Sports Writer
The sports that come to mind
when one thinks of New Zealand
are cricket, rugby and sailing -
most definitely not tennis. In 100
years of Kiwi tennis, only one
New Zealander, Tony Wilding,
has ever won a grand-slam title.

is more individually based, and I
think he gets more motivated to
compete for the team than him-
self."
Franks feels that if he has the
opportunity to help other people,
it's as equally as important to
individual results. He judges his
personal success off the team
results.
"Given a choice, I'd rather lose
every one of my matches and have
the team win every week than
win every one of my matches and
have the team lose," Franks said.
Franks's effort and ability to
lead got him elected one of the
team's two captains and he has
been well received in that role.
"He brings a lot of energy,"
Rossi said. "One thing he does
really well is that he speaks up.
If he doesn't like something, he'll
be on you about it. He is a real
leader and makes everyone bet-
ter by it."
Added Bernstein: "He com-
municates well with the team
and has good relationships. One
of the best things is his ability
to hold people accountable. He
speaks up well in a respectful

way, and if things aren't on track,
he looks to improve it as best he
can. It doesn't matter if it's a drill,
a set, a practice or a match - he's
always out there setting a good
example."
Franks grew up with plenty
of constructive criticism from
coaches and even his parents. If
something was wrong with his
attitude or game, it was never
sugarcoated for him. He realized
that this was helping him become
better and knew he could help
others the same way.
As an international player,
becomingcaptain was something
Franks never imagined before
coming to Michigan because he
had never played a team-oriented
sport.
And though Franks might not
boast the team's best record, his
team-first mentality doesn't go
unnoticed. Franks has become
known to Berque as a "relentless.
competitor."
Currently, Franks is playing
some of the best tennis of his

career as he has the second-most
dual-match wins this season,
trailing only senior Evan King.
Franks cites his confidence
as the key to his recent success.
His ability to stay on the court
and fight through long points has
been critical. Playing three-set
matches can be mentally drain-
ing - the victor is the player who
simply wants the win most.
"He's confident now and earns
every win," Bernstein said. "He
puts in the work and makes sure
to improve during the week. And
come match day, he is one of the
most intense guys I have seen.
"Freshman year, he didn't
embrace the long matches. But
now he wants the match-to-
match to come down to him and
the pressure to be there. He is
just a very fierce and fiery com-
petitor that guys have trouble
matching."
Franks's leadership could help
Michigan while it tries to win a
Big Ten Championship.
But even while trying to win a
title in the United States, he will
certainly never forget his New
Zealand roots.

class times has deadlines, which
is something he wasn't used to.1
In New Zealand, going late to
practice never had consequences.1
With time, however, Franks has
had an easier time acclimating.
The tennis program helped;
Franks transition to the Unit-
ed States, and there was great1
excitement within the Michigan
tennis community for Franks's
arrival.
Redshirt sophomore Justin
Rossi took it upon himself to
ensure that Franks felt comfort-
able. Rossi extended an invita-
tion to Franks to live with him
before the school year started -
an offer Franks was thrilled to
receive.
The gesture by Rossi was one
that Franks will be forever grate-
ful for.
"They took care of me and wel-
comed me when I was so far away
from home," Franks said. "At that
point, I didn't have my team-
mates, and having a home that
was open to me was really invit-
ing and helped me adjust."
The pair went on to be room-
mates freshman year.
Franks immediately became
one of the team's hardest work-
ers, constantly working to per-
fect his strong forehand, refining
his serve and gaining the mental
fortitude to compete in the Big
Ten. Despite a tough fall season,
Franks's receptiveness to coach-
ing was evident by his spring-
season results.
"By the time the dual-match
season came around, he started
doing really well," Berque said.
"He was playing a lot at No. 5 and
won lots of matches."
But despite the success, there
was one aspect in particular of
Franks that caught Berque's eye.
"The pattern that has been
consistent with him is that he
is much better in the (spring)
than the fall," he said. "The fall

in this new series, three daily arts writers

Bumpy Burger

When the all-powerful

my favorite
things about
this univer-
sity in my final farewell.
The truth is that Bollywood
movies - or rather, dancing to
their music - is the reason I
ended up at the University. Once
I saw my first Indian American
Student Association Cultural
Show in 2003, I knew in my
heart that there was no other
school for me. The show consist-
ed entirely of students dancing
to Bollywood songs.
I've been dancing my entire
life. Growing up in Boston, I
would help my mother move the
furniture in our apartment aside
to make room for her weekly
dance classes, which I'd then
watch from my newly assembled
couch-fort in the kitchen. I
trained for years in classical
and contemporary Indian dance
and saw every performance that
passed through town, but I had
long since given up on living out
my Bollywood dreams on stage.
At the IASA show, I saw 200
people doing just that.
IASA gave me a stage experi-
ence unlike any I had ever known
or will likely ever know again. I
will leave this university with the
unbelievable memory of dancing
for almost 4,000 people, feeding
off their energy and trying to give
them just as much back. I went up
on that stage as dancer, choreog-
rapher and organizer of the show,
but those seven minutes under
the lights never lost their magic.

What's the third? Crap!
Noah, to my right, is visibly swaying back and forth. And when he
doesn't hear the grill cook ask him what burger he wants, the guy shouts.
"Hey, burger! What kind!" Noah jumps and runs down to answer. Shit ...
what was that third thing?
"What do you want fried?" the guy asks, throwing me off. "Onions!" I
blurt out. Good, my reflexes work fine. And I'm left with a nice, juicy burger
at the end of the ordering process. Ipay the man and join Noah at the table.
First, the burger ... it's a revelation. With the fried onions and cream

OK, so maybe I'm just paranoid; I know I get paranoid a lot when I

left trying to ignore it.
Shit, the fuzz! OK, Brianne and Noah aren't noticing this, but a police car
is right outside with its lights on. Noah, seriously, stop waving your canteen
of alcohol around.
"Are you almost done with that?" I ask abruptly, as Brianne casually
munches a fry. "Oh, yeah, I guess so!" Good. I'm out the door and disappear

If this grease were an alien, it would have already taken over the world.
I didn't notice before, but it has already colonized me and now it's spread to
my keyboard, and I don't want to fight itbecause it's like the Imperius curse
- it just feels so good - and YOLO, so let's order another four patties, come
on, they're not that big anyway, what have we got to lose, just add another
three miles to our workout regimen tomorrow. I betI could eat around 20
of these and have room for the fried vegetables. I am the grease whisperer.
The grease says, "I would never lie to you. You want me in your belly." And
it's right, I do. Ritually sacrifice my good sense and beatify my health, sweet
Blimpy, on the altar of the grease gods. I belongto your cult now.
The only reason to come to this place is if you're with friends and some-
one says, "Hey, let's get Blimpy burgers!" and if that happens it should be
illegal to say no. There doesn't need to be a functional justification, you don't
need to be hungry, you just go, you eat, you joke, you eat more. College has an
unwritten exam, and that exam is experiences. Blimpy is a question on that
exam, and the answer is yes. If you say no to Blimpy, you can get all the As
you like, but there will always be a stain on that social transcript. A grease
stain, forever reminding you of the jokes you couldn't laugh at because you
were too sober and the foods you couldn't eat because you were too worried
about your six-pack.
Do better than me, reader! Get five patties! Order them with an egg! Don't
shy away. This is what you're here for. Even if the food isn't great, Blimpy's
is a worthy reminder that sometimes you are not supposed to be a good
person. Make a fool of yourself and dive into some finger food. Because the
grease gods are watching.

WCBN
From Page 1B
Potential, but as of yet unex-
plored, options include underwrit-
ing, a way nonprofit organizations
like WCBN can procure funding
from lusinesses by playing unbi-
ased, pierecorded messages on air.
The messages are overseen and
regulated by the FCC to ensure
there are no strict parallels with
advertising.
"It's just the facts. It's noncom-
parative, and it's dispassionate. At
its most base, it's money for air-
time, but it isn't advertising because
that's legally somethingelse,"Both-
ner said.
"If you listened to two compari-
sons of an actual ad and underwrit-
ing,thedifferenceisveryapparent,"
Madagame said. "We also aim for a
thematic relationship so it makes
sense for the listener. For example, I
had underwriting for a show about
sexual inequality and gender that
was done by a lab on campus that
needed participants for a related
study."
The radio station has also invest-
ed a significant amount of money
to upgrade their transmitter in the
hopes of reaching alarger audience.
"The current broadcasting area
has around 90,000 potential lis-
teners, while the new area will
reach approximately 175,000. But
at the same time, we have a very
loyal listener base that's been there
for 30 years," said Chief Engineer
Jim Campbell. "They don't listen
because it's a convenience or a tech-
nologythingbutbecause ofthe pro-
gramming."
Serendipitous radio
For many reasons, WCBN and
the content it produces are the
antithesis to commercial radio, a
direct contrast to popular music
stations and their recycling of
limited, Top-40 playlists. Unlike
a radio personality on a station
like Detroit's 95.5, a disc jockey at
WCBN has - barring the restric-
tions of the FCC - essentially
complete creative control over the
content he or she can assemble for
a show.
"Somebody can come in here
and make the kind of radio they
want to make," Newmeyer said.
"That includes not just music, but I
mean, interviews; do a short-story
reading ... just talk in the micro-
phone for a while. There's a lot of
things that can go into what a free-
form (slot can be)."
Thoughthe possibilitiesforcon-
tent are nearly endless, and though
the station does feature various
talk shows (including a sports
segment), WCBN's predominant
focus is music. The station's music

library is an overwhelming collec-
tion of thousands of vinyl records
and nearly 40,000 CDs that spans
every genre imaginable, and its
music-programming schedule
will unfailingly venture through
numerous genres over the course
of several hours.
"With us ...you can be like,'Well
it's Tuesday at seven o'clock. That
means I'm going to be hearing
some vintage ska, some Jamaican
sounds,'" Newmeyer said. "But in
general, what we do that makes
us special, in our opinion, is that
we not only (have a schedule), but
there's a certain amount of unpre-
dictability involved."
The disc jockeys at WCBN
describe themselves as "music
curators." Much like the curator
of a museum, these students often
strive to unearth rare music -
from the innumerable shelves of
WCBN's library or the Internet -
and present it to listeners in care-
fully constructed, yet contingent,
playlists on air.
"I'm a big fan of the chaotic and
the unexpected," Newmeyer said.
"I think that there's a lot of novelty
in that, in just not knowing what
you're going to hear. Because some-
times the thing that you're going to
hear is something that you would
never even know how to find oth-
erwise."
As a platform for music discov-
ery, WCBN differs from online ser-
vices like Pandoraor Spotify in that
it employs this human element to
creating variation in its content. In
that sense, WCBN and other online
stationsvie for divergent interests.
"If Pandora or Last.fm or Spo-
tify had like a shuffle button, where
... it has absolutely no bearing to
the kind of music that you say you
that you're into, just something off-
the-wall and completely random,"
Newmeyer said, "if they had a but-
ton like that ... then maybe I would
feel some sortofcompetition."
High-conceptradioart
Within the context of free-
form radio, WCBN's DJs can - in

addition to compiling songs for
a set - pursue their own artistic
ambitions in the form of "high-
concept radio art." As Madagame
explained, DJs frequently create
spontaneous art pieces during live
sets, using the various turntables
and CD players to layer spoken-
word tracks, instrumentals and
even an occasional whale sound
to construct one compelling, sonic
whole.
"One of my favorite things I've
ever done, actually," Madagame
said, "(was when) I played the
movie, 'We Are the Strange' ...
and I layered the entire (two-and-
a-half hour) movie with different
pieces of music at different times.
There was some metal music, some
indie music, some classical music,
sometimes all atthe same time."
Occasionally, the station's DJs
play spoken-word recordings or
songs to make political statements
- which, as Bothner pointed out,
have a longhistory atWCBN.
"When Reagan won the presi-
dency, we played 'It's My Party
and I Can Cry If I Want To' for 24
hours, non-stop," Bothner said.
"So (not all pieces) are 'good art.'
Nobody said it had toube pretty."
The creation of "radio art,"
according to Bothner and Mad-
agame, is an exercise in expand-
ing the ways we think about
sound.
"It's sort of like that conceptu-
alist idea of putting non-art things
in museums to appreciate them as
art," Bothner said. "As soon as you
put a piece of sound on the radio,
people hear it as music, even if it
isn't music. It sort of opens your
mind to the possibilities of things
that could be."
Though some would catego-
rize this philosophy, WCBN and
its content in general as geared
toward a specific niche, Newmey-
er disagrees.
"Maybe not even a niche, but
just (toward) people who are
open-minded. I mean, that's not
a niche," Newmeyer said. "That's
a large segment of the population.
People who are open-minded
have a huge amount of different
interests and ... aren't necessarily
going to turn on WCBN and hear
something they enjoy, and that's
totally not the point."
So is WCBN a purer form of
radio?
"Personally, I think about radio
not just as, 'We are WCBN, and
this is real radio,' but I think
Pandora is radio, too. Spotify is
radio," Madagame said. "They are
all online radio stations, like that's
all radio, and they serve their
purpose, and we serve a different
purpose.
"I think that we all play togeth-
er, and I don't think that we
need to fight against any of these
things. I think we just need to do
our thing well, and I think we do."

most importantly, the music mendedbutbizarre, psychedelic,

was Ras Michael, and I decided
on "Rastaman Gives Thanks
and Praise." I picked a power-
ful cover of "Proud Mary" from
Solomon Burke, "Lilizela Mlili-
zeli," a spirited, buoyant number
from Mahlathini and the Maho-
tella Queens and "Wash the Feet
of Jesus" by the Bluegrass Car-
dinals, which sounded exactly
how you'd expected.
Finally, I arrived at Asik
Veysel. I chose "Necip," (it was
the easiest to pronounce), and
as I pressed play, a whirlwind
of guitar and guttural prayer
flew into the room, making me
cringe. I almost turned it off, but
I remembered it was my duty
to embrace and experience this
new music, and so S grudgingly
allowed Veysel to continue doing
whatever the hell he was doing.
I outlined my show, prepared
my music and at last turned on
the microphone. Hesitating for
a moment, I managed to squeak
out a few words. The sound level
arrows barely moved. I took a
deep breath and tried again,
this time speaking louder, and
watched the arrows bounce up
excitedly.
I then pressed play on the
rockabilly record, but the speak-
ers were silent. I started to
worry until I realized that I had
left the mic on. I turned it off,
and the music snapped on. Of
course. Rookie mistake.
The rest of the show went as
smoothly as possible, consider-
ing the circumstances. I totally
butchered the pronunciation
of "Lilizela Mlilizeli," forgot to
turn off the mic a couple more
times and made a good amount
of prolonged and shaky tran-
sitions. Even more, I was so
worried about using the equip-
ment correctly and fulfilling all
the different things the demo
required that when it was time
for me to speak, I completely
forgot that I was supposed tobe,
well, myself, and instead ended
up speaking in the driest, most
monosyllabic tone that had ever
escaped my mouth. Carrying on
a one-sided conversation is real-
ly, really hard, I realized.
Still, I finished the show in
one piece and forgave myself for
my multiple mistakes. As I stood
to leave the room and return my
music, a small sense of accom-
plishment rose in me. I had been
completely reluctant to indulge
in these random albums, yet as
I stood there holding them in
my hands, I felt a certain affec-
tion for them. I had become part
of the WCBN community web
in some form or another, and as
I walked out of the station that
day, I couldn't help but hum the
melody of the African song I still
couldn't pronounce.
