Ann Arbor residents protest police 
brutality during ‘Workers’ Day’ rally

Protesters stand 
in solidarity with 
Ferguson in march 

around the city 

By ALLANA AHKTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

On May 1, which was Interna-

tional Workers’ Day in many parts 
of the world, community members 
protested for just policing policies 
for laborers of color.

Members of the group Ann 

Arbor to Ferguson organized 
the event to commemorate the 
Haymarket Affair in 1886, where 
workers who were peacefully pro-
testing job conditions were beaten 
and killed by the police in Chicago.

Rackham 
students 
Maryam 

Aziz and Austin McCoy said hold-
ing the protest on International 
Workers’ Day ties together broad-
er labor issues that impact both 
workers and Black Americans.

“We decided to do May Day to 

commemorate what happened in 
the Haymarket Square riots back 

in 1886 in Chicago, so we’re tying 
this into how the labor of Black 
lives doesn’t matter, how labor 
activists have always been treated 
as if their lives don’t matter either,” 
Axis said. “So we’re tying to two 
together to say you can’t say that 
you can’t separate Black lives not 
being valued from also the labor 
of the working class and people of 
color not being valued.”

McCoy said the protest was also 

held to raise awareness about larg-
er issues regarding police brutality 
against communities of color. He 
mentioned specifically the killing 

of Aura Rosser by the Ann Arbor 
Police Department in November. 
McCoy and Ann Arbor to Fer-
guson have been protesting and 
raising awareness about the issue, 
while also helping Rosser’s family, 
since her death.

The protest also addressed 

recent killings of unarmed Black 
men, which have received national 
media attention, such as the kill-
ing of Freddie Gray, who suffered 
from a fatal spinal injury after 
being arrested by Baltimore city 
police officers.

Michigan voters reject Proposal 1 tax initiative

GOVERNMENT 

Initiative called for 
1-percent increase on 
sales tax to improve 

infrastructure

By COLLEEN HARRISON and 

CARLY NOAH 

Summer News Editors

Tuesday night, a majority of 

Michigan voters rejected Proposal 
1, the initiative to increase sales tax 

rates from 6 to 7 percent to raise 
money for road repair.

Though votes continue to come 

in, as of approximately 11:00 p.m, 
more than 640,000 Michigan resi-
dents rejected the proposal, com-
prising 78 percent of the state’s 
voting population. In Washtenaw 
County, 5,237 voters, 65 percent of 
voters in the county, rejected the 
proposal.

Backed by Michigan Gov. Rick 

Snyder (R), the initiative aimed 
to repair Michigan’s roads and 
upgrade other major infrastruc-

ture. Additionally, the proposal 
aims to raise funds to improve 
the state’s mass transit system, 
increase the state’s Earned Income 
Tax Credit and provide additional 
resources to cities and schools.

The proposal, if passed, would 

also have had significant implica-
tions for higher education funding. 
The proposal requested the remov-
al of sales tax on fuel sales, which 
currently funds schools through 
the School Aid Fund and provides 
funding to local governments.

Roughly 20 percent of the yearly 

appropriation for public universi-
ties comes from the School Aid 
Fund. Under the proposed bill, 
public universities would no lon-
ger receive money from the fund, 
through community colleges and 
K-12 education providers would.

While the proposal had the 

potential to impact government 
appropriations to the University, 
public universities in the state of 
Michigan have only recently been 
allocated funds from the School 
Aid Fund. Historically, for state

Former Rep. 
Dingell donates 
papers to Bentley 

College educators 
explore learning, 
role of technology

Documents outline 

congressman’s 59- year 
tenure in the House 
of Representatives 

By IRENE PARK

Daily Staff Reporter

Thanks to John Dingell, the for-

mer U.S. congressman for Michi-
gan’s 12th Congressional District, 
the University’s Bentley Historical 
Library now has access to a collec-
tion of materials from his 59 years of 
service in the House of Representa-
tives. 

At a reception Wednesday eve-

ning at the Gerald R. Ford Presi-
dential Library, Dingell officially 
announced his donation of the col-
lection to the Bentley.

The 
collection 
includes 
cor-

respondence 
bills 
that 
Dingell 

introduced in the House as well as 
photographs taken during his time 
in office. 

In a statement released prior to 

the event, Dingell said he was hon-
ored to contribute documents to the 
Bentley Library.

“I consider myself the lucki-

est guy in shoe leather for having 
the opportunity to serve the good 
people of Southeast Michigan for as 
long as I did, and it is a real honor 
that the work we all did together 
will be documented here at this fine 
institution,” he said. “I am pleased 
they were able to find the space for 
all of it, but mostly I’m just honored 
and humbled to join the other out-
standing individuals whose good 
work for our state is archived at the 
Bentley, including my father.” 

Earlier this year, Dingell was 

honored for his policy work involv-
ing the Middle East. Dingell is also 
an active supporter of J Street Ann 
Arbor, a national advocacy group 
that promotes conflict resolution 
between Israelis and Palestinians 
through creating two independent 
states — one Israeli and one Pales-
tinian — out of what is now Israel.

Event showcased 

projects on 
modernizing 

teaching methods

By ALEX JUNTTI

For the Daily

A group of approximately 250 

educators gathered at the Ross 
School of Business on Monday to 
learn and talk about how tech-
nology can be used in education 
to develop new ways of provid-
ing a more dynamic learning 
experience for students.

one through my hard work 

and the hard work of so many 
other people, the opportunity to 
be with their family for the rest 
of their life,” she said.

The keynote event was hosted 

by the University’s Teaching 
and Technology Collaborative, 
which holds events and offers 
consultations to teach faculty 
members how to utilize tech-
nology in their teaching and 
research.

The first portion of the event 

showcased recent winners of 
the seventh annual Provost’s 
Teaching Innovation Prize in an 
interactive poster fair held in the 
Davidson Winter Garden. The 
prize recognizes University fac-
ulty projects that demonstrate 
exciting, modern approaches 
to engaging students in learn-
ing, and was sponsored by the 
Office of the Provost, the Center 
for Research on Learning and 
Teaching and the University 
Library. Attendees were encour-
aged to speak with the win-
ners and learn more about their 
research and findings.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily, James Hilton, 
dean of libraries and vice pro-
vost for digital education and 
innovation, said projects like 
these are a great way for stu-
dents to connect with the course 

material outside the classroom.

“These 
winning 
projects 

challenge students to actively 
apply what they’ve learned to 
real situations that can be much 
messier than those described in 
textbooks,” Hilton said. “In the 
process, students learn to collab-
orate and think critically, often 
across disciplinary boundaries.”

Alongside the TIP present-

ers were additional projects 
by teams who received CRLT 
Investigating Student Learn-
ing grants as well as technology 
projects conducted by Teaching 
and Technology Collaborative 
members.

Jill Halpern is a mathematics 

lecturer and a TIP winner. Her 
project focused on teaching the 
principles of calculus through 
tangible, 
observable 
occur-

rences. She said she often takes 
her students to the Museum of 
Natural History and the Nichols 
Arboretum to demonstrate how 
processes such as half-life and 
sequences in series can occur in 
nature.

“I want to get my students 

asking, ‘Why?’,” Halpern said. 
“Out of the classroom they can 
really see the world, so that 
means when they come back to 
a traditional classroom, there’s a 
lot more, ‘What is this used for? 
Where does this come from?’ 
then there might otherwise 
because they’ve been primed to 
ask those questions.”

Musicology 
Prof. 
Mark 

Clauge 
said 
the 
innovative 

efforts of these teams are chang-
ing the way students learn new 
material.

“This kind of experimenta-

tion is something that is really 
vital for the classroom,” said 
Clauge. “When students are in a 
classroom where the faculty are 
experimenting with new ideas, 
new approaches and new philos-
ophies of learning, they start to 
become more conscious of their

Ben Carson to run in 2016 presidential race 

Former pediatric 
director announces 
candidacy from his 

native Detroit 

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Summer Managing News Editor

Ben Carson, a University alum 

and 
renowned 
neurosurgeon, 

announced his candidacy for the 
2016 presidential race Monday 
afternoon.

Carson, who will seek a nomi-

nation from the Republican Party, 
said he is not focused on votes, but 
rather is asking the voting public 

to consider his ideas and views.

“I’m not even asking people to 

vote for me. I’m just asking people 
to listen,” he said. “The real pedi-
gree we need to heal this country 
is someone who believes in our 
constitution.”

The 63-year-old is anticipated 

to be the only African American 
entering the pool of candidates 
vying for the Republican nomi-
nation. Senators Marco Rubio of 
Florida, Ted Cruz of Texas and 
Rand Paul of Kentucky are also 
seeking Republican nominations.

Several unannounced candi-

dates for the Republican nomina-
tion remain, including Michigan 
Gov. Rick Snyder. Last week, Sny-

der released a statement saying he 
was considering running, and he 
will make a formal decision within 
the “next couple of months or so.”

A Detroit native, Carson has 

never run for public office, but 
earned national recognition dur-
ing his leadership in the pediatric 
unit of Johns Hopkins Children’s 
Center in Baltimore.

“I’m not politically correct, and 

I will probably never be politi-
cally correct,” Carson said. “I’m 
not a politician, I don’t want to be 
a politician. Politicians do what’s 
politically expedient. I want to do 
what’s right.”

At 33, Carson was the youngest 

director of the center’s pediatric 

unit. In 1987, Carson performed 
the world’s first operation to sepa-
rate twins who were conjoined at 
the head. The success of the oper-
ation was the subject of the auto-
biographical film “Gifted Hands,” 
in which Carson was portrayed by 
actor Cuba Gooding Jr.

Carson 
holds 
conservative 

political views, which he attri-
butes to his Christian faith and 
upbringing. Opposing both abor-
tion and same-sex marriage, he 
has made many notable appear-
ances before the Christian com-
munity, including at the 2013 
National Prayer Breakfast.

Carson’s speech at the break-

fast, of which Obama was in atten-

dance, was considered critical of 
the Obama administration’s health 
care policy. The speech earned 
him support from the conservative 
community. Carson encouraged a 
program in which newborn babies 
are given health savings accounts 
as an alternative to Obamacare.

“When a person is born, give 

him a birth certificate, an elec-
tronic medical record and a health 
savings account to which money 
can be contributed — pretax — 
from the time you’re born ‘til the 
time you die,” Carson said. “When 
you die, you can pass it on to your 
family members, so that when 
you’re 85 years old and you got

“I think today has larger mean-

ing because of what’s going on in 
Baltimore, Terrance Kellom shoot-
ing in Detroit on Tuesday as well,” 
McCoy said. “So this is for Aura 
Rosser, but it’s also about all the 
Black folks who’ve been shot.”

The protests began in Liberty 

Square and moved to State Street 
and Main Street before reaching 
the Ann Arbor City Council office. 
Traffic stalled in all streets where 
the protest took place, and many 
protesters shouted, “no justice, no 
driving,” at cars. Two police cars 
trailed behind the rally.

Protesters held signs saying 

“Black Lives Matter,” “We Will 
Never Let You Forget Aura Ross-
er,” “Justice for Aura Rosser” and 
“Strong Communities Make Police 
Obsolete.”

Jeffrey Sorensen, a University 

alum and co-founder of the startup 
optiMize, participated in the pro-

test. He said he attended the protest 
because of his continued frustra-
tion over police brutality.

“It’s just this story that keeps 

coming up again and again and 
again, and yet a huge, huge per-
centage of people just don’t pay 
attention at all, or are totally mis-
informed, or stop paying attention 
after an hour and just go about their 
lives,” he said. “Just the response 
is really sad to me. A lot of people I 
grew up around, a lot of white peo-
ple, just don’t give a shit at all.”

Ypsilanti resident Anthony Mor-

gan also participated in the protest, 
and brought along his two young 
daughters. He said he has been fol-
lowing Ann Arbor to Ferguson’s 
movement since its beginning, and 
finds it important to teach younger 
generations about social justice and 
community activism.

“It’s a necessity, I’m at an age 

where we’re transferring the wis-
dom of the elders to the energy of 
the youth, kind of like Common 
said in ‘Glory.’ It’s a way to use new 
school understanding with old 

school experience and still fight 
some of the same shit, though. It’s 
constant, the fight never ends.”

Many pedestrians on the streets 

looked on and recorded the march 
on their cell phones. Some onlook-
ers yelled back at the protesters in 
frustration, while others showed 
solidarity by honking their horns or 
raising their hands in reference to 
the “hands up, don’t shoot” phrase 
and gesture that originated in the 
shooting of Michael Brown in Fer-
guson, Mo.

Engineering junior Josh John-

son saw the protest while he was on 
Main Street, and said even though 
it caused traffic standstill, because 
there was no property damage, he 
appreciated the demonstration.

“If they’re not hurting anyone, 

if they’re not causing damage, I 
appreciate their opinion, but if they 
are destroying peoples’ property, 
then I think that’s wrong,” Johnson 
said. “If they are peacefully protest-
ing, then I appreciate their opin-
ions, no matter what side it’s on.”

funding, the University has relied 
more heavily on the General Fund.

In an interview with The Michi-

gan Daily before elections ended, 
representative Jeff Irwin (D–Ann 
Arbor) said he supported the pro-
posal, but he anticipated voters 
would not pass the resolution.

“I think its going to fail today 

because citizens are very frustrated 
that the Republicans are continu-
ing to lower taxes on the wealthy 
and increase taxes on the lower and 

middle class,” Irwin said.

In an interview with the Daily 

following the election, Rep. Adam 
Zemke (D–Ann Arbor) said he was 
disappointed in the results of the 
proposal, but he believes voters sent 
a clear message.

“I think that the message is that 

they want the roads fixed, but they 
do not trust the Legislature to do it 
in the manner that was proposed 
by Proposal 1,” he said. “I think 
that the leadership that has been 
in place for the last four years has 
given them plenty of reason not to 
trust the current Legislature.”

Economics Prof. Donald Grimes 

said effects of Proposal 1’s fail-
ure may be felt in five to 10 years, 
by which point costs to repair the 
roads will drastically increase.

“Five or ten years from now this 

is going to be a severe blow to the 
Michigan economy and the quality 
of life of residents,” Grimes said.

The state Legislature is consider-

ing alternative plans for road repair, 
including one proposed by House 
Speaker Jase Bolger, which passed 
in the state House, but not the state 
Senate, last term. If passed, the ini-

FROM THE DAILY

Too little too late

Impending shut-offs highlight inadequacies in aid programs 
O

n Monday, during a Detroit City Council meeting, offi-
cials and activists convened to form a workgroup to 
evaluate the effectiveness of the city’s current water 

bill assistance programs, and to begin proposing an affordability 
program. These assistance programs arose in response to an out-
pouring of public outrage and critique after the city implemented 
extensive water shut-offs throughout its residential areas last 
year. These programs were created to alleviate the financial bur-
den of unpaid water bills and prevent future infringements upon 
residents’ basic human rights. However, concerns about contin-
ually delinquent accounts and another set of impending water 
shut-offs set for later in the month demonstrate that Detroit’s 
efforts to remedy the situation — while well-intentioned — are 
precariously delayed.

Initiated by an announce-

ment from the Detroit Water 
and Sewerage Department in 
March 2014, 46,000 shut-off 
notices were issued to resi-
dents with delinquent water 
payments and water service 
ceased for roughly 4,531 cus-
tomers in May of last year. 
A similar scenario of water 
shut-offs is expected to occur 
later this month. Even with 
the creation of these assis-
tance programs last year, 
20,000 
to 
25,000 
house-

holds in Detroit have been 
declared delinquent on their 
water bills, which means 
their payments are at least 
60 days overdue or residents 
are in debt by $150 or more. 
Residents are then given a 
mere 10 days to respond by 
seeking assistance or mak-
ing a payment before losing 

service. The re-emergence 
of shut-offs and of citizens’ 
continued inability to afford 
their water bills highlights 
the city’s failure to find a way 
to address this long-standing 
problem in a timely manner. 
Concerns about this year’s 
delinquent accounts should 
have 
been 
addressed 
far 

sooner than just a few weeks, 
or even a few months, before 
 

the shut-offs.

Yet, measures from existing 

assistance programs — as sug-
gested by Detroit’s Chief Oper-
ations Officer Gary Brown 
— seek to ensure financially 
struggling 
residents 
won’t 

have their water shut off sim-
ply because they are unable to 
pay. Financially strained cus-
tomers can avoid losing service 
and begin decreasing their 
debt by enrolling in a payment 

plan. Since last year’s shut-
offs, assistance programs have 
provided some aid to residents 
beneath the poverty line who 
are struggling to pay. Accord-
ing to DWSD Deputy Director 
Darryl Latimer, approximately 
31,000 citizens are enrolled 
in payment plans, touting an 
increase of 11,700 individuals 
since last year. The current 
program, which underwent 
revisions 
in 
April, 
assists 

financially burdened custom-
ers by paying 50 percent of 
overdue charges and covers 25 
percent of future bills. A more 
comprehensive assistance pro-
gram is expected to be enacted 
in July.

However, due to the fact 

that 30 percent of more than 
1,800 individuals who were 
enrolled 
since 
September 

were incapable of maintain-

D

emonstrations and protests 
ensued in Baltimore as a result 
of the death of Freddie Gray 

due 
to 
alleged 

police 
brutality. 

Gray, a 25-year-old 
African American 
man, 
suffered 
a 

spinal cord injury 
while 
in 
police 

custody on April 
12, and died as a 
result of the injury 
seven days later. 
Although 
much 

is still unknown 
about the incidents that caused the 
injury, Baltimore Police Commissioner 
Anthony W. Batts revealed that the 
“police employees failed to get him 
medical attention in a timely man-
ner.” He also commented “We know 
he was not buckled in the transporta-
tion wagon as he should have been. No 
excuses for that. Period.” 

On Tuesday April 28, Mayor Stepha-

nie Rawlings-Blake enacted a city-wide 
curfew, and Governor Larry Hogan 
declared a state of emergency, deploy-
ing the National Guard. Johns Hop-
kins University went through several 
precautions due to safety concerns and 
encouraged its students to stay in their 
dorms by closing some of the school. 

Curious as to how members of 

Hopkins were affected by these inci-
dents, I interviewed Kidist Ketema, 
an African American senior at Johns 
Hopkins University studying pub-
lic health and economics, and Sharif 
Braxton, an African American Johns 
Hopkins alumni and an employee at 
the John Hopkins Bloomberg School 
of Public Health.

In the midst of peaceful demonstra-

tion, some individuals in Baltimore 
began rioting, burning cars and, as 
headlined in the media, looting a CVS 
drugstore. News sources circulated 

the words “Baltimore Burning” and 
“Baltimore Erupts,” disregarding the 
many peaceful protesters and the rea-
soning behind their frustrations. This 
created a skewed idea of the real issues 
the majority of the protesters were 
coming together for—a stand against 
police brutality across America.

Both Ketema and Braxton stressed 

that the demonstrations that they 
attended were mostly peaceful, con-
trary to the media portrayal.

Braxton attended some of the pro-

tests and commenting on the demon-
stration on Tuesday, he stated, “There 
was a very peaceful protesting and in 
terms of trying to preach the impor-
tance of community and the impor-
tance of togetherness and everything 
in between that were there. It was 
about being concerned for black 
rights, but human rights as well, 
which you haven’t seen that as much 
in the media. Especially since the peo-
ple who were doing the looting and 
the rioting weren’t really concerned 
with the initiative as a whole.”

Social media created a direct source 

to highlight some of these incon-
sistencies and gradually, the public 
began criticizing the media for not 
paying attention to the protests before 
the riots began and their general cov-
erage of the events. Ketema said she 
found social media “helpful (in kind 
of) breaking down the situation and 
understanding what’s actually going 
on.” Social media has been a way to 
bring awareness and support of other 
movements, such as the protesting in 
Ferguson allowing for a national con-
versation. Both the protestors and the 
police department attempted to rally 
support on Twitter, in realization 
of the importance of social media in 
swaying public opinion.

Ketema explained how when she 

opened her Yik Yak on Monday, what 
she found were racist comments from

ing their payments and dropped out 
of the program, a more sustainable 
method of assisting Detroit’s low-
income populations needs to be imple-
mented. As discussed by the work 
group committee Monday, efforts 
to address the delinquent water 
accounts must shift in focus to the 
systematic issues surrounding overall 
water affordability rather than solely 
 

providing assistance.

Avoiding discussing affordability 

will only allow the issue to stagnate, 
and will worsen some of Detroit’s 
other existing problems. Water pric-
es in Detroit have continued to rise 
with an 8.7-percent increase last 
year and an expected increase of 

3.4-percent this coming July, aggra-
vating the current situation. Many 
delinquent accounts are expected to 
belong to vacant residences once the 
shut-offs commence later this month. 
However, rising water prices — in 
combination with residents’ strained 
economic situations — may lead to 
an increase in abandoned proper-
ties as residents negotiate between 
expenses and choose to vacate prop-
erties with no water. While the city’s 
response has been delayed so far, it 
must act promptly from this point 
to address the issue of affordabil-
ity and make necessary changes in 
order to prevent the exacerbation of 
 

this problem.


I

t never hurts to remind 
yourself to think before you 
speak. And in the case of the 

21st century, 
it’s equally 
important 
to think 
before you 
post on social 
media. Yik Yak, in particular, 
adds a whole new layer to social 
media responsibility, where self-
monitoring becomes even more 
crucial. Through the anonymity 
provided by Yik Yak, posters to 
the app have more freedom to say 
what they want.

Launched in 2013, Yik Yak is 

an app for iPhones and Androids 
primarily aimed at and used 
by college students. Users can 
see, comment and like or dislike 
any posts on the app (known as 
“Yaks”) that are within a 10 mile 
radius of the user’s location. The 
intent is for students to see Yaks 
in relation to their respective col-
lege. While this app can provide 
a space for comedy and solidar-
ity with other students who took 
the same test or who also sat in 
their room alone on Valentine’s 
Day, there’s a darker side to these 
anonymous posts.

During the 21st century, soci-

ety faces a unique problem, where 
social networking and media 
apps can inflict significant harm, 
even if they mean well. Before I 
go further, I want to stress that 
my point is not to judge Yakkers. 
This is not intended to be a rant 
about the horrors of social media. 
In fact, many times Yaks have 
made me laugh when I’ve had a 
bad day, or there has been a Yak 
that resonated with me. After the 
earthquake in Nepal this year, 
Yik Yak spread the word about 
how to help aid recovery, so apps 
like these even promote good 
causes. As revered an app as it 
is, we cannot ignore the flaws 
and continue to use it as a place 
where we don’t have to monitor 
our thoughts, because our words 
really do make an impact on 
those around us. 

On the one hand, there are 

funny comments on Yik Yak that 
many people can identify with: 
“When the elevator’s empty and 
there’s no one to judge me for 

using it to go up one floor.” When 
something happens on campus, 
many people take to Yik Yak to 
joke about it. During the night of 
the four consecutive fire alarms in 
East Quad, the stream of Yaks was 
endless. One said, “If someone is 
trying to discretely smoke weed 
in their room at East Quad, please 
stop trying because it’s obviously 
not working.” Others said things 
like “EQ: 4 RESIDENTS: 0.” And 
in large part, Yak streams are 
funny in these ways.

That being said, given the 

complete anonymity that the app 
allows, there’s a less than positive 
side to this social media phenom-
enon. Scrolling through posts, I 
have seen sexist, racist and hurt-
ful comments. Comments, such as 
“girls are way hotter at the gym,” 
— a Yak posted at the University 
of Michigan — objectify women, 
placing the focus, yet again, on 
the value of women in their out-
ward appearances. Students take 
to Yik Yak to rail on their room-
mates, annoying people in the 
UgLi or someone they overhear 
saying something they think is 
stupid, perpetuating a culture of 
passive-aggressiveness and put-
downs. Not to mention, many of 
these students who end up on Yik 
Yak likely use the app and would 
be hurt by these comments.

Yik Yak has also been used 

to bully people. In March 2014, 
a 17-year-old girl organized a 
campaign and a petition at her 
high school after Yaks about 
her depression appeared on the 
site. Taking to Yik Yak to speak 
about someone’s mental illness 
in this way is bullying and com-
pletely unacceptable.

Then, in October 2014, through 

Yik Yak, students at Rowan Uni-
versity spread the word about 
an illegal sex tape that had been 
filmed without the subject’s con-
sent. Misogynistic and homopho-
bic comments have also spread 
throughout Yik Yak in colleges, 
such as Colgate College and Uni-
versity of Texas, among many 
others. A professor at Eastern 
Michigan University was ready 
to take legal action, after stu-
dents in her class posted sexu-
ally explicit things about her on 
Yik Yak. Recently, there was a 

Yak that proposed a gang rape at 
Kenyon College’s women’s cen-
ter. At the University, one Yak-
ker posted, “Why wouldn’t I be 
pro gay marriage? They leave 
more women for me to fuck. Sup-
ply and demand baby.” These are 
just a few examples of the prob-
lematic posts that are becoming 
 

increasingly evident.

Given the problems Yik Yak 

brings up, changes must be 
made to ensure that this app 
holds users more accountable. 
Although the creators of Yik Yak 
have taken commendable mea-
sures to ensure that the content 
on Yik Yak is appropriate, there 
are significant gaps, and mea-
sures could be taken a step fur-
ther. Unless there is a “specific, 
actionable threat,” Yik Yak holds 
fast to user anonymity. Thus, 
holding users accountable for 
non-actionable threats that may 
otherwise slip under the radar is 
important. For example, rework-
ing the report tool so that when 
someone reports a post, the Yak 
disappears until it is reviewed 
would help. Currently, there is 
a warning when certain words 
such as “Jewish” and “bomb” 
are inserted into a Yak, and that 
warning should be extended to 
other words and phrases. Auto-
matically banning users who post 
multiple Yaks that break the rules 
could also help mitigate the prob-
lem. If someone’s Yak is taken 
down because it broke the rules, 
that Yakker should be notified. 
Providing posters with an under-
standing of why their post was 
taken down allows them to think 
about what they post and may 
inform them next time. Finally, 
and most importantly, users need 
to act. If we cannot create a bet-
ter environment around Yik Yak, 
these systematic changes won’t 
do much difference. We have to 
ask ourselves: would I be com-
fortable posting this if it weren’t 
anonymous, or would it offend or 
hurt someone? Yik Yak shouldn’t 
become a place to put down rac-
ist, sexist, bullying or otherwise 
hurtful comments.

Think before you post.

those at Hopkins and at univer-
sities in the surrounding area: 
“Things 
like 
‘black 
students 

wouldn’t have gotten in if it 
weren’t for affirmative action’ 
attacking the black students who 
were involved in protests earlier 
in the year.” She 
mentioned how this 
made her feel iso-
lated at her 
own institution.

Ronald J. Daniels, 

president of John 
Hopkins University, 
issued a statement 
concerning Freddie 
Gray’s death and the 
Baltimore protests: 
“It is essential that 
all of our city’s citizens have trust 
and confidence in professional and 
fair treatment by our police...We 
also recognize, and must acknowl-
edge, the frustration felt in com-
munities across this country, born 
of continuing racial disparities 
in education, employment, and 
 

criminal justice.” 

Ketema 
still 
felt 
Hopkins 

could have been more active in 
response to the events in relation 
to its students.

“I didn’t feel like the Univer-

sity did much to communicate to 
the students,” she said. “There 
were some last minute attempts 
to create a safe space like meet-
ing yesterday, but other than that 
we haven’t gotten much from the 
 

University itself.”

Braxton spoke on the lack of 

political and social awareness of 
the general Hopkins campus, but 
also saw some positives.

“There are a lot of students that 

are not African American that 
went to the protests and gathered 
around realizing the importance 
of the solidarity,” he said. 

When responding to the situ-

ation, President Barack Obama 

stated 
it’s 
impor-
tant 
that we 
“don’t 
just pay 
atten-
tion 
to 

these 
commu-
nities 
when 

a CVS burns,” but the economic 
inequality, school climate and 
police brutality in Baltimore have 
been continuously overlooked. 

This may be the first time Bal-

timore is being highlighted on a 
national level for the areas with 
residents that are disadvantaged 
due to systematic problems, but 
that doesn’t mean that it ends 
here. The issues of police bru-
tality, poverty and institutional-
ized racism are linked in many 
places across America, including 
Detroit, and these are problems 
that are persistent throughout 
the year. We cannot ignore these 
problems until another Trayvon 
Martin, Eric Garner or Freddie 
Gray is killed.

We must say to ourselves: 
 

Never again.

Director-producer 
discusses genre and 

special effects

By JAMIE BIRCOLL

Senior Arts Editor

Science fiction is a difficult 

genre to tackle, as it asks the 
audience to suspend its disbelief 
and buy into unusual, fantasti-
cal ideas. But, if successfully 
engendered, sci-fi can achieve 
what no other genre can really 
tap into: grand thematic strokes 
combined with exceptional cre-
ative flourishes.

“The reason to work in sci-

fi from my point of view is that 
you’re just allowed to deal with 
big themes and big ideas and not 
be embarrassed about it,” writ-
er-director Alex Garland said in 
a conference call in which The 
Michigan Daily took part. “You 
know if you try to put that stuff in 
an action movie or even an adult 
drama … people get kind of sort of 
almost self-conscious about really 
big questions, and feel like it might 
be all be too pretentious or what-
ever. But sci-fi audiences want big 
ideas, they like them being named 
checked, it’s seen as an advantage 
rather than a negative.”

Garland’s 
latest 
film, 
“Ex 

Machina,” has been hailed by 
many critics as a modern genre 
staple, an achievement all the 
more impressive when one realiz-
es the film is Garland’s first serv-
ing as director, though it wasn’t 
his initial idea to direct.

“I didn’t think in those terms (of 

directing). In a weird way, I don’t 
really care about those terms, it’s 
partly ’cause I just don’t — I don’t 
really overstate the role of the 
director,” Garland said. “I think 
at the point I was writing it, I was 
really just trying to figure out does 
this work, is there a movie here, 
does it work in its own terms. 
And the directing aspect of it was 
something that just came later and 
just felt like it made sense.”

For Garland, filmmaking is 

a team process, one where the 
director is just another cog in 
the machine that is film produc-
tion. Every person on set has a 

role to play.

“The way to make it work is all 

about the people you work with, 
it’s just as simple as that,” Garland 
said. “I mean it’s the team that 
are the filmmakers and how they 
work with each other and the level 
of the ideas they come up with and 
how they solve problems. And so 
you know it’s the director of pho-
tography and it’s the production 
designer, and it’s the actors, and 
that’s how twe film is executed.”

But certainly there were 

potential challenges, especially 
with crafting the sleek comput-
er-generated effects to create 
Ava (played by Alicia Vikander, 
“Anna Karenina”), the hyper-
intelligent AI on whom the 
story is centered. Ava’s sleek 
metallic body features eerily 
human 
characteristics, 
and 

gives the character a complex 
appearance. But Garland notes 
how the computer generation 
process didn’t interfere with 
the rest of production.

“Actually it was very, very 

easy on this film,” Garland said. 
“You can’t shoot this constantly 
fussing about the effects shot. 
 

Just shoot it as if you’re shoot-
ing humans and we will figure 
out a process by which you don’t 
have to worry about it past that. 
In other words just shoot the 
drama, don’t worry about the 
process … (the computer gen-
eration) was all done in post-
production. So it was a, from my 
point of view, a very simple pro-
cess indeed.”

While the computer generated 

image certainly adds an aesthetic 
appeal, it is the actors who bring 
the characters forward, finding 
the deep-seated motivations of the 
characters. Of particular note are 
Vikander and Oscar Isaac (“A Most 
Violent Year”).

About Vikander, Garland said, 

“You could just see that (she) was 
just totally holding her own and 
sort of transfixing you and had 
this amazing presence and amaz-
ing confidence,”

And about Isaac, Garland took a 

more assertive stance.

“One of the most common lines 

of bullshit that I read in reviews or 
film writing is talking about how 
a director coaxed a performance 
out of an actor. If you met Oscar, 
I promise you, you’d see I didn’t 
coax anything out of him,” he said.

But the ideas of the film — ideas 

of gender, identity, free will, the 
very construct of humanity — all 
constitute the soul of the film. And 
it was conveying these ideas in a 
realistic but thought-provoking 
level that motivated Garland most.

“I mean, basically, because it’s 

an ideas movie, that’s really what 
it is. It’s got a bunch of thoughts 
and questions and it’s proposing 
them and only answering some 
of them,” Garland said. “And so 
there was an attempt to be very 
thoughtful 
and 
very 
reason-

able in the presentation of these 
things, because I know, unfortu-
nately all too well, what my own 
limitations are and failings either 
in talent or intellect.”

Shallow ‘Vacancy’

TV REVIEW

By KAREN HUA

Daily TV/New Media Editor 

“The movie wasn’t as good as 

the book,” we’ve said, we’ve heard, 
we’ve recounted time and again 
about 
all 
our 

favorite classics.

Unfortunately, 

just as we said 
about the “Harry 
Potter” 
series, 

the same notion 
applies to “The 
Casual Vacancy,” 
the HBO minise-
ries based on J.K. 
Rowling’s epony-
mous novel. After 
the “Potter” frenzy that launched her 
to success, “Vacancy” meant to set her 
apart from a name that would define 
her entire authorial career — proof 
that she could write more than just 
wizarding fantasy.

And prove she did — Rowling 

wrote another quintessentially British 
novel aimed to explore similar themes 
as “Potter” did, but through a more 
mature lens. “Vacancy” delves into 
the intertwined world of teenagers 
and their parents, reminiscent of a sti-
fling suburbia where individuals grow 
up and stay trapped forever.

The small-town tale jumps in 

media res, introducing the mundane 
lives and minute social conflicts in 
Pagford, a pastoral microcosm with 
an unsettling kind of immaculacy. 
While idyllic hills and cobblestone 
streets and laughing kids on bikes roll 
across the screen, the town struggles 
to uphold its pristine nature by vying 
the “needs” of the few over the needs 
of the less fortunate in an almost 
Dickensian way. Exemplifying that 
dynamic is Pagford’s city council, 
headed by the conservative curmud-
geon couple Howard (Michael Gam-
bon, Dumbledore from the “Harry 

Potter” series) and Shirley Mollison 

(Julia McKenzie, “Notes on a Scan-
dal”) who strive to socially engineer 
Pagford’s perfection. The council is 
stabilized by the more liberal Barry 
Fairbrother (Rory Kinnear, “The Imi-
tation Game”), who spearheads the 
movement to overturn Mollison’s ini-
tiative to turn their community center 
into a tourist and retail enterprise. 

Barry is popular among the lower 

class for his altruism, as he looks 
after Krystal Weedon (Abigail Law-
rie, newcomer), a crass-mouthed teen 
under social service surveillance for 
having a heroin-strung mother; and 
Arf Price (Joe Hurst, “Private Peace-

ful”), his reserved nephew with an 
abusive father — both youths who the 
community center benefits. When 
Barry mysteriously dies, perfection is 
usurped as citizens scramble to fill his 
temporarily vacant spot on the coun-
cil, unveiling their true colors beneath 
their façades. 

The first part of the miniseries 

ends with a premonition from “the 
ghost of Barry Fairbrother” narrating, 
“It’s impossible to keep secrets in this 
place, isn’t it? Oh, you’d be surprised, 
Pagford. Everyone’s got skeletons 
raveling in their cupboard.” Pagford 
attempts to obscure its problems of 
class and justice, when really, they 
are more evident than ever in a place 
where everyone knows everything 
about everyone. In a land of homo-
geneity, trivial problems become 
magnanimous to its inhabitants, and 
perfection soon becomes uncomfort-
ably eerie — a social statement on 
Rowling’s part about the perils of stag-
nant suburbia. The show uses silence 
and the motif of mirrors to reflect this 
eeriness on the characters themselves, 
leading viewers to question every 
intention and ulterior motive.

In Pagford, everyone duals as 

both a protagonist and an antagonist 
— every character has texture and 
complexity. However, what could be 
a beautiful multidimensionality scat-
ters the focus of the show, providing 
inadequate screen time for characters 
who must be conveyed with greater 
depth. There are less heinous sides to 
Krystal that inform her self-destruc-
tive tendencies; Arf has small, but 
significant spurts of independence, 
while the show only depicts him as 
an awkward doormat; other council 
members Tess Wall (Monica Dolan, 
“Pride”) and Parminder Jawanda 
(Lolita Chakrabarti, “Venus”) are 
strong female figures who could have 
balanced out this patriarchal tale.

Their story is painted through stel-

lar cinematography of a picturesque 
rural England, a key highlight of the 
show. However, the visual impecca-
bility is analogous to the “pretty” but 
superficial writing that doesn’t quite 
dig deep enough into the characters. 
The 500-page novel is shrunken into a 
three-hour miniseries — just a tad lon-
ger than a feature-length film, yet not 
nearly long enough to capture more 
than the brisk essence of the story. It’s 
the characters, not the plot, that gives 
the novel its true depth — that makes 
the novel worthy of our tears, rage and 
pity. Three hours is only enough to 
introduce personas, not to empathize 
with them.

New Mumford & 

Sons album garners 

mixed reactions 

By AMELIA ZAK

Daily Music Editor

Life holds no constants. Sur-

rounded by an ever-changing 
host of situations, people, weather 
and 
numerous 

other 
circum-

stances, we float 
in a sea of vari-
ables. 
Frost’s 

frequently cited 
line, 
“nothing 

gold can stay,” 
reflects the feel-
ing best: we can-
not control the 
transience. So, amid the shape-
shifting and unidentifiable mark-
ers of incoming situational traffic, 
we all must grow and change in 
order to survive — and then hope-
fully thrive. But does this ines-
capable condition of the human 
experience apply to the music 
industry? Must artists change 
their sound, technique or style in 
order to survive — and then hope-
fully thrive?

Recalling Bob Dylan’s assimi-

lation of the electric guitar in the 
late 1960s and ’70s, a troubadour 
deity was transformed into an 
electric-guitar-wheeling warlord 
to the disappointment, anger, 
excitement or appreciation of 
many. Why did Dylan make this 
change? Perhaps he felt it neces-
sary to continue his production of 
inspired, original work. Or maybe 
Dylan couldn’t deny the attraction 
he held toward a sound antitheti-
cal to his acoustic guitar and har-
monica-centered arrangements.

Mumford & Sons made a simi-

lar and equally public transition 
that was granted with equal lev-
els of applause and criticism. The 
folk fans have rejected Wilder 
Mind as a sellout disappointment, 
while less invested audiences have 
greeted the album with ambiva-
lence. The reaction of the less 
invested audience defines the 
album best: Although produced 
fantastically and flowing seam-
lessly, the album allows the audi-
ence to be relatively indifferent. 
Through either the language or 
melodies, each track on Wilder 
Mind is easily digested upon ini-

tial consumption. To the soft and 
hard hearts, the cynics and the 
lovers, the casual listener and the 
auditorium audience, Mumford 
& Sons has always created, at the 
very least, universally approach-
able pop music. But unless drawn 
in by the emotional, poetic lyrics 
of heartache and loss, the Wilder 
Mind listener is asked to accept 
the same crescendo, the same 
electric guitar solo, the same Mar-
cus Mumford melodic scream.

When asked for the source of 

the album’s genre departure, the 
men of Mumford & Sons cited a 
change of location, altered per-
sonal relationships, and greater 
access to a myriad of instruments 
in the studio (rather than the 
limited instrumental resources 
of a tour bus). Guided by the pro-
duction styles of James Ford and 
Aaron Dessner, and recorded 
completely in New York City, 
Wilder Mind emerged draped in 
Strokes-like guitar solos, with a 
touch more angst, leather jackets 
and skinny jeans. Even amid these 
structural aesthetic changes, the 
musical talent of these Brits isn’t 
lost. The music is still exciting at 
times: Jam-packed with electric 
build-ups and subsequent cre-
scendos, trendy bass fills, random 
incorporations of a string section 
and jarring lyrics of a lost love, 

many of the songs recreate the 
physiological effects of a quick-
ly-drank Red Bull. The album’s 
literature, in fact, appears to be 
dedicated to the dramatic, almost 
heart-wrenching grappling of a 
found, won and then ultimately 
lost love.

But these sonic and lyri-

cal trends of Wilder Mind lack 
moderation. Each track seems 
to follow a formula: contextual 
build-up, chorus, more build-
up, a crescendo and satisfying 
denouement. “Tompkins Square 
Park,” “Believe,” and “The Wolf,” 
the album’s entry tracks, follow 
this blueprint excessively. While 
these high tempos and enthu-
siastic escalations are sure to 
be greeted with accolades and 
appreciation at the year’s audi-
toriums 
and 
music 
festivals, 

analytical listeners and folk fans 
suffer. Some respite is granted in 
the album’s last tracks: the slower 
“Ditmas,” “Only Love” and “Hot 
Arms” highlight a more delicate 
sound that was once intrinsic to 
the Mumford impression. Gone 
are the days of the banjo swings 
and acoustic guitar ballads for 
the folkiers.

Lyrical depth, another innate 

item of the Mumford music, limps 
along in its emotional effective-
ness on Wilder Mind. The myriad 

of references — Shakespearian, 
Platonic, Biblical and Steinbeck 
— sprinkled throughout 2009’s 
Sigh No More and 2012’s Babel 
make no similar reappearance in 
this 2015 effort. Most lyrical ref-
erences relate the music to areas 
of New York City, like a district 
of Brooklyn, as in “Ditmas,” or in 
the album’s opener, “Tompkins 
Square Park.” The final product 
is still engaging, but these small 
subtractions 
in 
Wilder 
Mind 

erode the potential diversity past 
albums incorporated.

“So I took you to the city for 

the night / to dance under dizzy, 
silver lights” sings Marcus Mum-
ford in the verses of the second-
ary, yet undeniably pretty track 
“Broad-Shouldered 
Beasts.” 

Touching and wholesome, many 
Wilder Mind tracks reveal that 
the signature Mumford brand 
of sonic and lyrical imagery 
wasn’t completely abolished by 
the electric guitar. For better or 
for worse, and as a result of the 
band’s creative boredom or rein-
vented inspirations, the album’s 
sound is more mainstream and 
malleable.

As waves of musical electric-

ity replaced the simple acoustic 
guitar Dylan plucked over his 
gravelly vocal tellings of a lady 
who left him tangled up in blue, 

many were convinced that Dylan 
made his transition for the sake 
of greater mainstream recogni-
tion and fandom. He was accused 
of giving the people what they 
want, because they, and all else 
associated with current popular 
culture media forums, dictated 
the market. But when examined 
retrospectively, 
Dylan’s 
foray 

into electronic was successful. 
His talents as a musician sur-
passed the strictures set in place 
by his audience. Dylan’s persona 
as the peace-loving troubadour 
belittled his smorgasbord of tal-
ents. Dylan’s electronic days bril-
liantly juxtaposed all that he once 
was and all that he was supposed 
to be.

Dylan’s changing of musical 

avenues isn’t perfectly paralleled 
in Mumford’s recent departure, 
but similarities must be noted. 
The changing of the artist brings 
criticism across the spectrum: 
from “these boys are sell outs” 
to “this is innovative and inter-
esting; bring on the change.” 
Nevertheless, these multifaceted 
debates belie a mediocre album. 
Uninteresting 
with 
sporadic 

moments of radical or inspired 
musicality, Wilder Mind is con-
currently the most and least inno-
vative album the men of Mumford 
& Sons have produced to date.

six diseases, you’re not trying to 
spend up everything. You’re happy 
to pass it on and there’s nobody 
talking about death panels.”

Carson has also called for devel-

oping oil and energy in the United 
States, arguing that petroleum 
independence would deplete fund-
ing for terrorists groups in the 
Middle East. He has also endorsed 
a flat income tax rate, an idea he 
compared to 10 percent tithing 
that appears in the Bible.

Despite gaining much support 

from conservatives for his public 
critiques of the president, Carson 
has had several public blunders.

In 2014, Carson withdrew from 

speaking at the Johns Hopkins 
commencement ceremony after 
students protested comments he 
made comparing gay men and 
women to pedophiles.

A March interview with CNN 

garnered much negative feedback 
after Carson said being gay is an 
absolute choice because many 

inmates who go to prison straight 
are gay when they are released.

Carson has also compared the 

Affordable Care Act to slavery, 
saying it “robs you of your own 
ability to control your own life.” 
This statement and others he made 
comparing the U.S. government to 
Nazi Germany have made him the 
subject of additional criticisms.

During remarks at the Detroit 

Music Hall on Monday morning, 
Carson addressed criticisms alleg-
ing he wants to scale down on wel-
fare programs

“There are many people who 

are critical of me because they say 
Carson wants to get rid of all the 
safety nets and welfare programs 
even though he must’ve benefited 
from them. This is a blatant lie. I 
have no desire to rid of safety nets 
for people who need them. I have 
a strong desire to get rid of pro-
grams who create dependency in 
able-bodied people.”

Carson will be the first African 

American to represent the Repub-
lican Party in the presidential race 
if he wins the party’s nomination.

own learning.”
He also said experimenting with 

new teaching techniques is benefi-
cial to the teaching community.

“These kinds of experiments 

and these kinds of projects expand 
the imagination for me as a teacher 

also to sort of understand the dif-
ferent dynamics that students face 
and start to see things from a stu-
dent’s perspective,” Clauge said.

After an hour of mingling with 

presenters, the crowds moved into 
the Blau Auditorium, where the 
five TIP winners were officially 
recognized before a panel of Uni-
versity educators took the stage 
to discuss how the University can 

drive innovation through experi-
mentation with new digital land-
scapes.

Specifically, the panel focused 

on Unizin, a consortium of 10 uni-
versities including the University 
of Michigan. The consortium aims 
to develop and share new, benefi-
cial digital technologies for teach-
ers and students, support content 
systems that empower faculty and 
provide analytic services.

One such technology is Canvas, 

a learning management system 

that the University plans to imple-
ment over the next couple of years 
to replace CTools.

Tim McKay, Arthur F. Thurnau 

professor of physics and director 
of the LSA Honors Program, spoke 
about the importance of Unizin’s 
efforts to create a community of 
educators intent on developing 
higher levels of learning and the 
tools needed to do so.

“Everybody who is using these 

new tools should be thinking about 
how to, in a scholarly way, figure 
out what’s happening and, in the 
same scholarly way, share that 
information with the rest of the 
community so that when we make 
these decisions they won’t just be 
rolling over us, we’ll actually be 
making them in an informed way,” 
McKay said.

Stacy Morrone, associate vice 

president of learning technologies 
at Indiana University, said Unizin 
is working to make sense of and 
join together emerging tools and 
data.

“Unizin seems to be the conver-

gence of so many things that we 
should be thinking about around 
content, the learning manage-
ment system and what all this data 
means for the success of our stu-
dents,” Morrone said.

Angelo Pitillo, director of the 

University’s 
English 
Language 

Institute, also attended the panel 
and said the event was a great 
opportunity to learn about the lat-
est research being pursued in high-

er education.

“We’re at a really important 

time with the development of 
technology for teaching and learn-
ing,” Pitillo said. “I think it’s really 
important to know where we’re at 
and where we’re going.”

Family-assisted doc 
portrays rockstar in 

his truest form

By BRIAN BURLAGE

Daily Arts Writer

It’s usually the same with famous 

actors and musicians: when they die, 
fans have a really, 
really hard time 
believing it. 

Conspiracy 

theories 
bubble 

up 
from 
the 

depths of God-
knows-where 
while 
folklore 

and mythologies 
sprout, and leg-
ends adjust to incorporate the mag-
nanimity of these shooting stars 
— Elvis, Jim Morrison and Tupac 
among them. Each is said to dwell 
now in some far-off corner of the 
Earth, destined to a life of personal 
repose, away from all the fanaticism 
and phoniness that probably drove 
them to death in the first place. 

On April 8, 1994, a VECA Electric 

employee discovered Kurt Cobain’s 
body in Cobain’s home in Washing-
ton. A shotgun rested on his chest; 
there were bullet wounds near his 
temple. He had left a handwritten 
note in a flowerpot, and the coroner 
determined the death a suicide. 

That weekend, a public vigil was 

held in Seattle, where Cobain’s wife, 
Courtney Love, and his daughter, 
Frances Bean Cobain, read the note 
and grieved openly with fans. Amy 
Dickinson, in an article titled “Kurt 
Cobain’s Last Tour,” described the 
Buddhist-inspired memorial that 
followed, and the manner in which 
Cobain’s ashes were handled: “(his) 
ashes have now been fully conse-
crated and formed into roughly a 
dozen tsatsas. A small shrine, called 
a nirvana stupa, is being made by a 
Tibetan Buddhist artisan to house 
them.”

At the time of his death, Cobain 

and Love had been arguing exten-
sively and consistently about every-
thing from money to music. Many 
theorists have interpreted some of 
what Rosemary Carroll (Cobain’s 
attorney) said following his death, 
and they claim Cobain faked the 
incident to elude a difficult divorce.

Other theorists adhere to the 

information provided by Tom Grant, 

a private investigator hired by Court-
ney Love to investigate the death. 
Grant concluded that it was, in fact, 
a homicide, and many fans have 
since mistaken the case’s vagueness 
for the possibility that Cobain is still 
alive somewhere in the world today. 

Director Brett Morgen’s “Kurt 

Cobain: Montage of Heck” does 
wonders to discredit and dispel all 
theories, tales and lies surrounding 
Kurt Cobain’s death (and life). The 
film’s most poignant and most beau-
tiful contribution to the Nirvana/
Cobain canon is the way it introduces 
him above all else as a man, a father 
and a husband. Though he became 
a demi-god of sorts in the world of 
alternative-grunge rock, represent-
ing the millions of disaffected, angry 
and disheartened youth, “Montage 
of Heck” reminds us that he was a 
young man with problems, too. He 
simply had a talent for making them 
inhabitable. 

Courtney Love came to Mor-

gen in 2007 with the idea of taking 
a more intimate, more honest look 
at Cobain’s chaotic life. Sorting 
through 200 hours of unreleased 
music and film and several thousand 
pages of writing and documentation, 
Morgen delivers “Montage of Heck” 
— the first Kurt Cobain documen-
tary that accounts for full participa-
tion from his family. This certainly 
gives the film a balanced perspec-
tive, albeit one of astounding, some-
times shocking emotion. Part of the 
tension in the storytelling emerges 
precisely from this contradiction: 
How can family members accurately 
paint the picture of a loved one when 
they each feel differently about his 
or her passing? Where does truth lie 
in relation to tragedy? 

In an interview with Paste Maga-

zine, Morgen explains how he was 
given access to all kinds of undis-
covered audiotapes and video reels, 
including a 1988 clip of Cobain los-
ing his virginity. He notes that with 
certain recordings, no one – not even 

Courtney — had heard them before. 

In this way, “Montage of Heck” 

is also a feat of rediscovery, not just 
for the millions of Nirvana fans, but 
also for Cobain’s closest family and 
friends. They each revisit the world 
they shared before 1994, and as we 
watch the story unfold, we become 
more and more aware of this sense 
of haunting. Morgen describes it 
perfectly: “that (haunting) became a 
thing with our film — the interviews 
sort of go from day to night. It starts 
out sort of with morning in America, 
and everything is optimistic and 
groovy. And then at some point the 
sun goes down, and we’re starting to 
get to 5 o’clock, and then we go into 
the evening and into the shadows.”

What also plays into this cathar-

tic, yet unsettling feeling in the 
film is the audio-visual portrayal of 
Cobain’s own psyche. He was deeply 
disturbed by the fame and spotlight 
that found him and dragged him 
from the American music under-
ground. He was wary of the socio-
logical norms that defined what an 
American male should be, what a 
husband and a father should be, and 
he felt a deep alienation as a result. 
Many of Cobain’s diary entries, 
shown in tender sequences inter-
spersed between interviews, reveal 
the paranoia and agitation he felt, 
even from an early age.

It took eight years of research-

ing, sifting, compiling, editing, 
talking, choosing, recreating and 
envisioning to bring “Kurt Cobain: 
Montage of Heck” into form. At 
132 minutes long, the documen-
tary offers deep insight into the 
life of Cobain and his family with-
out overstaying its welcome. Pho-
tos, artwork, animations, diaries, 
home videos and recordings give 
the film a distinct personality, as 
though the story of Cobain’s life 
has the same vitality as the man 
himself — not the rock star, but the 
27-year-old kid from Aberdeen, 
Washington.

Success of transfer 
students helpful

By BEN FIDELMAN 

Daily Sports Writer

The most veteran players for the 

Michigan baseball team had quite a 
bit on their plates last weekend, out-
side of a three-game series against 
No. 16 Iowa. Six of the team’s 33 
players also celebrated their gradu-
ation from the University.

Though senior day for the Wol-

verines is still a few weeks away, 
those six players had the opportu-
nity to attend ceremonies for both 
student-athletes and with all of the 
members of the Michigan class of 
2015.

Friday night was also the first 

game in the team’s series against the 
Hawkeyes — a contest that lasted 
over three-and-a-half hours, finish-
ing at 7:35 PM. The Student Athlete 
Commencement was scheduled to 
begin around 8:00 PM, so the play-
ers had to hustle across to the Crisler 
Center to make it in time.

This original recruiting class 

was one of the last put together by 
former coach Rich Maloney, who 
left the team following the 2012 
season. When current Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich arrived on cam-
pus, he went to work bolstering 
the group by looking for players at 
junior colleges who could make an 
impact in his program.

Bakich ended up taking two 

transfers in this class, in Patrick 
and center fielder Jackson Glines, 
who spent the beginning of their 
careers at Black Hawk and Fresno 
City Colleges, respectively. Patrick 
has started 32 games this season for 
the Wolverines, and Glines holds 
one of the Big Ten’s top batting 
averages, at .367.

“We don’t take very many trans-

fer players,” Bakich said. “We build 
our program with high school kids 
that are going to be here for four 
years. I was a junior college player, 
and I think it’s great. It certainly 
serves a purpose, where a lot of 
times athletically kids may not be 
on top of their game out of high 
school or aren’t fully developed. 
Academically and socially, there’s 
a maturation process that comes 
with being in college for a couple of 
years.”

Much of the Michigan coaching 

staff has experience being in the 
junior college game. Both Bakich 

and assistant coach Nick Schnabel 
transferred from junior colleges to 
East Carolina, where they played 
together. Pitching coach Sean 
Kenny even coached for a year at 
a junior college when starting his 
coaching career.

Bakich believes that the staff’s 

experiences give them an eye for 
picking out potential transfer play-
ers, but that advantage only goes so 
far.

“We all have roots with it,” 

Bakich said. “I don’t know if it gives 
us any sort of upper-hand, but we 
certainly understand where these 
guys are coming from, where they 
have been and the rigors of the 
transition of coming to an elite aca-
demic school like Michigan.”

The staff looks to the transfer 

players to fill gaps in the team. Pat-
rick and Glines are good examples 
of this, and junior left fielder Cody 
Bruder, who transferred to Michi-
gan from Orange Coast College, 
can also be added to that list. How-
ever, because players are brought 
in for such a specific task, there is 
a significant amount of pressure to 
perform.

“You’re thrown into the fire right 

away,” Patrick said. “You’ve got 
to come in and perform, because 
you’re brought in for a specific role. 
If you don’t fill that role, you’re kind 
of out of the lineup. It’s definitely 
interesting from a team dynamic, 
because you’re coming into a new 
family. I spent three years at junior 
college and knew the ropes there, 
and all of a sudden I’m in Ann 
Arbor, Michigan, not Moline, Illi-
nois, anymore.”

All three transfer players have 

performed well, and have made up 
one third of the starting lineup for 
many games this season.

Without the help from Patrick 

and Glines, the senior class would 
sit at just four members, none of 
which have made significant sta-
tistical contributions this season. 
As the team moves down the final 
stretch of the regular season, it will 
continue to lean on those two to 
anchor its veteran charge both on 
and off the field.

And maybe with their leadership 

and continued on-field success, the 
Wolverines can land some post-
season success for the first time in 
years.

Seven Wolverines 

get NFL contracts

By ZACH SHAW 

Managing Sports Editor

Last fall, the Michigan foot-

ball team had one of the nation’s 
smallest senior classes at just 12 
players.

But in the past week, half of 

them have signed on to continue 
their careers in the NFL. After 
junior receiver Devin Funchess 
and senior defensive end Frank 
Clark were drafted in the second 
round of the 2015 NFL Draft last 
Friday, several seniors have fur-
thered their football careers.

Both 2014 team captains — 

linebacker Jake Ryan and quar-
terback/receiver Devin Gardner 
— will have the opportunity to 
take their leadership to peren-
nial powerhouses. The Green 
Bay Packers drafted Ryan in the 
fourth round, while Gardner — 
who will switch to wideout in the 
pros — was signed by the New 
England Patriots as an undrafted 
free agent.

“I’m very excited for this oppor-

tunity,” Gardner said at the Bob 
Ufer Quarterback Club banquet on 
Monday. “It’s a dream that I’ve had 
since 1998. I remember being in 
class, and the teacher said, ‘Write 
down what you want to be when 
you grow up.’ And I said, ‘NFL 
football player.’ And she laughed at 
me. And everybody else laughed.

“They didn’t believe it would be 

a possibility because so few people 
get a chance to do it. But like I said, 
I’m about to get a chance to do it, 
and I’m going to take full advan-
tage of it.”

Three 
other 
Wolverines 

earned invitations to rookie 
camps as undrafted free agents. 
Defensive end Brennan Beyer 
will join the Baltimore Ravens, 
defensive back Delonte Hollow-
ell signed with the Detroit Lions 
and kicker Matt Wile will join 
Funchess in Carolina.

Though still unsigned as of 

Wednesday, defensive back Ray-
mon Taylor remains a candidate 
to join the league, garnering inter-
est from a handful of teams.

Michigan topples 
Central in extras

By ZACH SHAW 

Daily Sports Editor

After being shut out in back-to-

back games for the first time in Erik 
Bakich’s three-year tenure as head 
coach, the Michigan baseball team 

was 
relieved 

to finally score 
with two outs 
in 
the 
first 

inning of Wednesday’s game.

But the Big Ten’s top offense 

didn’t stop there. The Wolverines 
(12-9 Big Ten, 29-20 overall) plated 
five two-out runs in the first two 
innings, then converted a suc-
cessful squeeze bunt to score the 
winning run in the top of the 10th 
inning to defeat Central Michigan.

“It’s always good to get the posi-

tive result that you’re chasing,” 
Bakich said. “The last couple games 
have kind of been a fluke offensive-
ly. We weren’t able to scratch any 
runs across, but you knew it was 
coming. It’s good for the momen-
tum heading into the weekend to 
play well and get better and move 

our team in the positive direction.”

The win came after ugly losses to 

Iowa and Illinois-Chicago on Sun-
day and Tuesday, respectively. The 
team hit just .167 as a team in those 
games, well below its season aver-
age of .300. Despite the alarming dry 
spell, Bakich was impressed with his 
team’s ability to bounce back.

“They’re smart kids,” he said. 

“They know that it was just a cou-
ple days where we didn’t get the 
bounces and find the holes that 
we normally find. But that doesn’t 
change the fact that we still have 
a confident offense full of capable 
hitters.

Though the top of the order 

has carried the flag for Michigan’s 
offense most of the season, it was 
the bottom half that did the talk-
ing. The Wolverines’ bottom five 
hitters went a combined 7-for-18 
and drove in four of six runs.

Despite the balanced effort, it 

was pinch-hitter and senior infield-
er Eric Jacobson who proved to be 
the hero. With junior outfielder 
Cody Bruder on third base with the 

game tied in the 10th inning, Jacob-
son laid down a flawless squeeze 
bunt to drive in the go-ahead run.

“He’s our most selfless player,” 

Bakich said. “He’s the consummate 
teammate, grinder, guy that you 
cheer for. He loves Michigan, he 
loves representing Michigan … all 
he cares about is the team and help-

ing the team win more than person-
al statistics. More than anything, he 
is just 100 percent in it for the team.”

The win was a welcome sight to 

the Wolverines, whose chances of 
attaining an at-large NCAA Tour-
nament bid effectively ended with 
the two losses.

Returning home for the final 

seven 
regular-season 
games, 

Michigan knows it faces an uphill 
battle to rebuild momentum in 
time for the Big Ten Tournament, 
set to begin May 20.

“We know we’re going to take 

some blows, we know we’re going 
to trade punches, and we look for-
ward to that challenge.”

Softball racks in big awards

By TYLER SCOTT 

Daily Sports Writer

It should come as no shock that 

when the 2015 Big Ten softball 
awards were announced Wednes-
day, several players from the Michi-
gan softball team were among those 
honored.

Sophomore right-hander Megan 

Betsa was named the Big Ten Pitch-
er of the Year, an achievement she 
and Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
both attribute in part to the work 
she put in during the offseason. In 
total, seven Michigan players were 
honored.

Hutchins was hardly stunned.
“I vote, and I’m allowed to nomi-

nate eight (players), and I did,” 
Hutchins said. “But the numbers 
are the numbers and there were 
some pretty fat numbers in our con-
ference this year, so it was tough to 
be considered. I thought for the 
most part it fell the way it would.”

Along with Betsa, junior second 

baseman Sierra Romero, sopho-
more left fielder Kelly Christner and 
senior left-hander Haylie Wagner 
were all First-Team Big Ten honor-
ees. Betsa, Romero and Christner 

were unanimous selections.

Junior centerfielder Sierra Law-

rence, sophomore shortstop Abby 
Ramirez and senior catcher Lauren 
Sweet were Second Team All-Con-
ference. Christner, Wagner and 
Lawrence received All-Defensive 
recognition as well.

The players weren’t the only 

ones to be honored for their contri-
butions to the Wolverines’ eighth 
consecutive Big Ten championship 
season. Hutchins reeled in her 15th 
career Coach of the Year award, 
her eighth since 2004.

Michigan is highly dedicated to 

Hutchins’ softball philosophies. The 
players believe in what their coach 
has to say. That belief is a monumen-
tal testament to Hutchins’ coaching, 
and it gets results.

“(Betsa’s award) is a real credit 

to the work she put in. From our 
last pitch in Tallahassee last year, 
she stayed here this summer, she 
worked really hard,” Hutchins said. 
“The greatest growth for her has 
been her ability to stay one-pitch 
focused. She really bought into the 
one pitch tougher mentality. It’s 
worked really well for her. It’s excit-
ing to see her have such success.”

Before Betsa, Wagner was the 

last Michigan hurler to earn Pitch-
er of the Year honors in 2012, which 
is hardly a coincidence. Betsa is 
aware of the changes she’s made on 
her approach to the game this sea-
son and the success it has brought.

“I was obviously really excited 

(about the award),” Betsa said. “I 
feel really lucky and blessed to be 
here at this University doing this 
every single day. It’s something I’ve 
worked really hard for. I felt that I 
deserved it in the way that I worked 
in the offseason, bettering my men-
tal toughness was a big aspect of 
that. I’ve grown to be a student of 
the game in that aspect. I really like 
where I’m at.”

After a day of recognition and 

accolades, Hutchins continued to 
challenge her players in preparation 
for the post-season, echoing Rome-
ro’s focus on what is next to come.

“To me the test is, ‘Can you do it 

now carrying that trophy around on 
your shoulders?’ ” Hutchins said. 
“(Betsa) might be the Big Ten Pitch-
er of the Year, but that’s not going to 
get her a strike. It’s not going to get 
her a pitch. She’s going to have to go 
out there and work hard.”

2015 Men’s lacrosse in review

By BRANDON CARNEY 

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan men’s lacrosse 

team was in control of its own 
postseason destiny heading into its 
regular season finale against Penn 
State.

A win would have secured the 

Wolverines a fourth-place regular-
season finish in their inaugural 
year of Big Ten lacrosse.

But Michigan was unable to 

overcome a five-goal deficit, and 
eventually fell one goal short of 
extending its season. The Wolver-
ines (1-4 Big Ten, 5-8 overall) fin-
ished fifth in conference play.

Despite the season’s premature 

ending, there are many positives 
that the young Wolverines can 
take away from the 2015 campaign. 
Michigan finished with a 5-8 
record, tying the program record 
for wins in a season. The Wolver-
ines also made huge strides defen-
sively, allowing the lowest goals 
against per game average in team 
history with 11.54, while causing 
8.92 turnovers per game, good for 
fourth in the country.

Keeping the good and the bad in 

mind, the Daily breaks down the 
fourth season of Michigan men’s 
lacrosse.

MVP: Gerald Logan
The 
Wolverines’ 
first-choice 

goalie was sidelined with a shoul-
der injury for the entirety of 
the 2014 campaign. But Logan 
returned and showed his tough-
ness in the net throughout the 2015 

season, as he helped transform the 
Michigan defense.

The redshirt sophomore ranked 

fifth nationally with 12.85 saves 
per game. Early in the year, Logan 
consistently bailed out his back 
line nearly every time it made a 
bad play or allowed an easy look 
at goal.

As the defenders around him 

grew in ability and confidence, 
Logan found his job became eas-
ier. Harder shots forced by his 
defensemen increased his save 
percentage.

Logan will surely headline as 

one of the nation’s top goalies in the 
next two years if he can continue to 
anchor the Wolverines’ defense the 
way he did this season.

Most Improved: Chase Young 

and Stefan Bergman

Both Young and Bergman start-

ed the year on the bench, awaiting 
the opportunity to break into the 
first team.

Bergman slipped into the start-

ing lineup when junior defender 
Chris Walker suffered a midseason 
injury. The sophomore defender 
played a key role in the evolution of 
Michigan’s off-ball defense, while 
shutting down some of the Big 
Ten’s most prolific scorers in con-
ference games.

Young struggled to break out 

of the Wolverines’ deep attacking 
midfield unit early in the year. The 
freshman was forced to change 
positions when injuries began to 
take their toll on Michigan’s defen-
sive midfield.

And that’s when Young’s raw 

talent and speed became noticeable 
on the field. Opposing attackers 
found it difficult to outrun Young in 
transition, and his hustle and quick 
hands were an important addition 
on the defensive end.

Bergman and Young ended up 

being the key ingredients in the 
renaissance of the Wolverines’ 
defense, and both are expected to 
grow steadily in the years to come.

Best Win: 9-8 (4OT) at St. 

Joseph’s, March 14

Michigan had struggled to win 

both on the road and in games 
that went down to the wire in 
its first three years as a Division 
I program. So few thought the 
Wolverines would be able to hang 
on to a fourth-quarter lead when 
they played the Hawks in Phila-
delphia.

Despite traveling without their 

top goal scorer, sophomore attacker 
Ian King, the Wolverines were able 
to pull out a gutsy win when King’s 
replacement, junior attacker Peter 
Kraus, scored the game-winning 
goal in the fourth overtime.

Michigan could have folded 

when St. Joseph’s went on a 6-1 run 
to tie the game with 29 seconds 
remaining. After all, the Wolver-
ines had collapsed in similar situa-
tions in past seasons.

Yet, Michigan recovered and 

showed mental toughness, primar-
ily on the defensive end, through 
four sudden-death overtime peri-
ods until Kraus finally came up 
with the game-winner.

Five things we 
learned: Softball

By CHRIS CROWDER 

Daily Sports Writer

The No.3 Michigan softball team 

has lived up to expectations this 
year, winning its eighth-consec-
utive Big Ten title. In some ways, 
the Wolverines have also exceeded 
expectations, as several players 
have made drastic improvements 
from last year.

With the Big Ten Tournament 

beginning Thursday, the Daily 
breaks down five things we learned 
from Michigan’s regular season.

1. Megan Betsa is the go-to 

pitcher

After a stellar freshman cam-

paign last season, in which she tal-
lied 18 wins and a 2.15 earned-run 
average, Betsa has become one of 
the top pitchers in the nation in her 
2015 campaign. She now leads the 
Big Ten with a 1.46 ERA and has 24 
wins — second best in the confer-
ence.

Betsa has also thrown two no-

hitters this year against Michigan 
State and Maryland, giving her 
a slight edge over her teammate 
and senior pitcher Haylie Wagner. 
Toward the beginning half of the 
season, Betsa got the Wolverines out 
of tough games in relief for Wagner. 

2. Haylie Wagner needs to be 

consistent to earn a national 
championship

After Wagner had some struggles 

toward the beginning of the season, 
including a 3-0 loss to Kent State, 
she has been on top of her game. Her 
faults were minimal, but she has 
returned to her All-American form 
as of late.

Hutchins describes her pitch-

ing staff as not having an ace, but a 
deuce in Betsa and Wagner. After 
senior right-hander Sara Driesenga 
was lost for the season due to injury, 
it was up to Wagner to be the sole 
senior in the circle. Her ERA is not 
as good as last year, but at 1.76, it’s 
still something to celebrate.

Wagner has gained more confi-

dence and consistency in the circle 
as the season has gone on. The Wol-
verines will need that trend to con-
tinue because if both pitchers are 
playing their “A” game, the national 
championship may be in reach.

3. Sierra Romero is as good as 

advertised, again

Going into the season, Romero 

was once again highly touted as one 

of the best players in the country, 
and she has not slowed down.

She may be in a bit of a slump late-

ly, but Romero still remains at the 
top of most Big Ten hitting catego-
ries. Her batting average, slugging 
percentage and on-base percentage 
are still far and away best in the con-
ference. Until two weeks ago, her 
slugging percentage was over 1.000 
— one of just a handful of players in 
the nation to do so.

4. Hitting is contagious, for 

better or for worse

Hutchins has credited Michi-

gan’s spectacular hitting to the idea 
of hitting being contagious. It seems 
like when one person is on top of 
their game, the rest of the lineup fol-
lows suit. But at the same time, the 
whole lineup can go through a funk 
for a game. The Wolverine lineup 
puts runs across the plate much 
more often than not, but has had 
some moments where the offense 
could not get going.

Michigan leads the nation in 

home runs with 101 — two shy of the 
program record set in 2005. From 
the leader in homers, Kelly Christ-
ner, to the only slap hitter in the 
lineup, Abby Ramirez, everyone is 
capable of hitting the ball hard and 
out of the park.

5. This team is one of the deep-

est in the nation

Michigan has dealt with plenty 

of injuries this season and has still 
outperformed nearly every team 
they’ve faced. The injuries have just 
provided an opportunity for oth-
ers to step up. When senior catcher 
Lauren Sweet went down, freshman 
Aidan Falk played well behind the 
plate in her absence. Recently, when 
junior left fielder Kelsey Susalla had 
to take some time off, freshman util-
ity player Taylor Swearingen played 
admirably when she was needed.

Out of the starting nine, six are 

batting over .325. Those coming off 
the bench to pinch-hit or run play 
well when they are called upon. 
And again, the Wolverines have 
two of the best pitchers in the Big 
Ten. And freshman first baseman 
Tera Blanco will likely see time in 
the circle next season.

Michigan is has a lineup in 

which everyone can contribute, 
for now and for the future. As long 
as they play like they have been all 
season, a national title is not out of 
the question.

Previewing the Big 
Ten Tournament

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

With the 2015 Big Ten Softball 

Tournament 
beginning 
Thurs-

day, the Michigan Daily examines 
what the top teams must do to hoist 

the champion-
ship 
trophy 

on Saturday at 
Buckeye 
Field 

in 
Columbus, 

Ohio.

Given 
the 

outcome of the 
regular season, 
it appears that 
the 
tourna-

ment will be 
two-horse race 
between Michi-
gan and Min-
nesota. 
Both 

teams 
domi-

nated Big Ten 
play with little 
resistance, but 
nothing is guar-
anteed to either 

team in their pursuit of the 
 

championship.

No. 1 MICHIGAN WILL WIN 

IF … it doesn’t try to fix what isn’t 
broken. The third-ranked Wolver-
ines (21-2 Big Ten, 48-6 overall) 
are on a roll heading into tourna-
ment play, boasting a 17-game win 
streak and a regular season con-
ference title.

With sophomore right-hander 

Megan Betsa — the Big Ten Pitcher 
of the Year — in the circle, it’s hard 
to believe that many teams are capa-
ble of scoring enough runs to topple 
Michigan from its current throne. 
Even if Betsa finds herself in trou-
ble, senior left-hander Haylie Wag-
ner is another ace who can pitch 
shutout softball for the Wolverines.

On the offensive end, Michigan 

has a dominant lineup bolstered 
by junior second baseman Sierra 
Romero and sophomore left fielder 
Kelly Christner. Romero leads the 
Big Ten in runs batted in with 63 
and Christner is tied for second in 
the conference with 18 home runs.

Realistically, if the regular sea-

son is any indication, Minnesota 
is the only threat to the Wolver-
ines. The Golden Gophers handed 
Michigan its most recent loss on 
April 3, a 9-1 six-inning run-rule 
victory.

No. 2 MINNESOTA WINS IF 

… right-hander Sara Groenewegen 
pitches lights-out from the circle. 
Groenewegen, who boasts a 1.52 
earned-run average, trails only 

Betsa in the Big Ten standings in 
the category. Groenewegen also 
excels at the plate, leading her 
team in home runs and finishing 
second on her team in both bat-
ting average and hits. Despite, 
her presence at the plate, Groe-
newegen’s pitching is still more 
vital for her team’s success.

The 
12th-ranked 
Golden 

Gophers (20-3, 46-8) will likely 
reach the championship game with 
ease, given that they have only lost 
three conference 
matchups: 
two 

against Michigan 
and one against 
Nebraska.

In those loss-

es, 
Groenewe-

gen allowed 15 
hits and 10 runs 
in 9.2 innings 
pitched. Howev-
er, in Minneso-
ta’s most notable 
conference win against the Wol-
verines, she posted 10 strikeouts 
while allowing just four hits and 
one run in six innings.

With the likelihood of both 

Minnesota and Michigan reach-
ing the final, Groenewegen will 
need to put together an elite per-
formance. Because in the Wolver-
ines’ 54 games this season, their 
six losses have come when they 
were held to four runs or less.

Shutting down a high-pow-

ered, home-run-hitting Michigan 
lineup is no easy task, but if Groe-
newegen can rise to the occasion, 
Minnesota has an opportunity to 
steal the tournament hardware.

THE 
UNDERDOG 
TO 

WATCH FOR IS… Nebraska, but 

“underdog” may be an overstate-
ment. Though the conference 
has been primarily dominated 
by Michigan and Minnesota, the 
Cornhuskers are still the No. 3 seed 
of the tournament.

To pull off an upset, Nebraska 

(17-6, 32-20) will need to thrive at 
the plate. An ace hasn’t emerged 
during the regular season, as right-
hander Emily Lockman is statisti-
cally the best option in the circle 
for the Cornhuskers with an unim-

pressive 
4.21 

ERA.

But Nebraska 

has players in the 
top four of four 
individual 
Big 

Ten 
categories: 

batting average, 
on-base percent-
age, runs scored 
and hits.

Specifically, 

third 
baseman 

MJ Knighten will need to have dom-
inating performances and continue 
to record numbers consistent with 
her .427 batting average and 76 hits. 
Centerfielder Kiki Stokes will need 
to contribute as well, as she was 
second in the Big Ten in on base per-
centage and fourth in runs scored.

Both Knighten and Stokes gar-

nered First-Team All Big Ten hon-
ors, but it will be tough for Nebraska 
to succeed if its mediocre pitching 
corps matches up with Michigan 
and Minnesota’s aces.

It would be unexpected for 

Nebraska to come out on top in 
a pitching duel, so its only hope 
is to outscore opponents and give 
its pitchers a cushion to work 
with.
