Time capsule

Sig Ep to move into

Amid the construction at s
Memorial Christian Church, v
located on the corner of Tap- b
pan and Hill Streets, members
of its former congregation and of t
the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity i
essentially heard its walls speak g
when a time capsule embedded in p
the building's cornerstone from f
1914 was opened yesterday as part t
of a decommissioning service at
the church. s
Among the contents of the i
dented copper box were a Bible,
a map of Ann Arbor, a history of a
the church with names of mem-
bers and officers and an American 1
flag with only 48 stars. The occa- g
sion was bittersweet for members o
of the Disciples of Christ, some in
of whom had attended services a
held at the church for more than t
30 years. The event symbolized a a
parting and a meeting as Sig Ep is
renovating the church to become o
its new University chapter house.

Goodness Day

Members of the student group
Do Random Acts of Kindness
offered free hugs, high fives, faux
tattoos and the chance to jump in
an inflatable castle on the Diagyes-
terday for the group's annual Good-
ness Day.
Engineering junior Sarah Khan,
* the event's co-coordinator, said
DoRAK planned the event to
help students reduce stress from
upcoming final exams and inspire
them to do good deeds in their daily
lives. The group organizes various
activities on campus to spread and
encourage kindness among stu-
dents.
In an effort to turn the day into
a school-wide event, Goodness Day
featured performances by two local
bands and 36 student organizations
that campaigned for philanthropic
causes. Members of DoRAK also
passed out pins that students can
take to Pita Kabob, Silvio's and
Middle Earth to take advantage of
deals offered by businesses for the
event.

their criticism of Adidas when
the company inexplicably shut

action violated Adidas' contract
with the University because the
company disregarded the Uni-

of conduct that requires that all

LSA junior Tessa Fast, a USAS

the event, said Adidas made $13
billion in revenue in 2011, which
included the severance it failed
to pay its Indonesian workers.
Fast added that the company
made an additional $1.8 million

The organizers of Maize Day participate insa flash mob on the Diag yesterday.
Maize Day unites campus

Inaugural
event promotes
achievements of
students
By ALICIA ADAMCYZK
Daily StaffReporter
University students pass-
ing through the Diag last night
were treated to impromptu
dance performances, free
T-shirts and ample school spir-
it at the University's inaugural
Maize Day celebration.
Maize Day 2012 was orga-
nized by LSA senior Jessie
Baker and Kinesiology senior
Ben Cronin to recognize and

celebrate the accomplishments
of various student organiza-
tions across campus. Baker
said she was inspired to orga-
nize the event after attending
similar celebrations at other
universities, and was surprised
the University didn't already
host an event honoring stu-
dents' achievements.
"We were talking about
how there's an absence of cel-
ebration for everything we do,"
Baker said. "There's a lot of
spirit but no celebration."
Cronin said he felt it was
important for the graduating
class to show underclassmen
how much the seniors had
enjoyed their time at the Uni-
versity, noting that he wanted
his class to "go out with a

bang."
Maize Day featured a capel-
la and dance performances,
as well as speeches by student
leaders on campus and appear-
ances by varsity athletes. Stu-
dent groups ranging from the
LSA Student Government to
the University's Quidditch
Team set up information
booths that attendees could
visit while enjoying the eve-
ning's festivities.
After a flash mob perfor-
mance lured spectators in
and a signed men's basketball
poster was given away to the
most spirited attendee, LSA
senior DeAndree Watson, the
Central Student Government
president, gave the first speech

Chair ousted amid
controversy over
leadership
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
DailyStaffReporter
Just weeks after a seem-
ingly uneventful election,
members of the University's
chapter of College Republi-
cans have recently been caught
in a power struggle between
the group's executive board
and the chair, as both sides are
claiming legitimate leadership
of the group.
LSA junior Rachel Jankows-
ki, the newly elected chair,
said the executive board does
not have the constitutional
right to remove her, but the
executive board alleges that it
unanimously voted her out of
her position.
According to an source affil-
iated with the College Repub-
licans who wished to remain
anonymous, the four voting
members of the newly elected
executive board attempted a
clandestine coup of Jankows-
ki.
"Several members of the
voting executive board tried
to suppress that they were
having these meetings," the
source said.
Jankowski said the execu-
tive board did not give her

notice of their intentions to
remove her before Sundayjust
weeks after the group's March
15th elections. She added that
she did not formally assume
office until April 3.
"I was given no reason for
the proceedings," Jankowski
said. "I was in office for five
days when the proceedings
were brought."
A previous version of the
College Republicans' consti-
tution allows for members of
the executive board to remove
the chair without obtaining
approval from the group at
large if the executive board is
united in its decision.
However, a constitutional
amendment passed at the
group's Wednesday night
meeting requires a vote by the
general membership to remove
a member of the executive
board.
LSA sophomore Russ Hayes,
a voting member of the execu-
tive board, wrote in an e-mail
interview that the board had
several legitimate reasons for
removing Jankowski.
Hayes alleged that she com-
mitted funding to an event
without consulting other
members, prevented members
from using the College Repub-
licans' social media accounts,
invited a speaker to a College
Republicans' meeting against
the wishes of other members

Snyder allocates
funds to train
more troopers
Gov. Rick Snyder has signed
a supplemental budget bill that
includes money to train more
state troopers and fight crime.
The measure includes $6.8 mil-
lion to start a new Michigan State
Police trooper recruit school in
June. The state plans to start with
132 candidates and aims to gradu-
ate 110 new troopers in October.
Also included in the bill signed
yesterday is $3 million to help the
city of Flint deal with a jail bed
shortage by obtaining jail space
* from other counties.
To help in high crime areas of
the state, the measure sets aside
$1.5 million to provide additional
police assistance and $900,000
for additional prosecutorial ser-
vices.
ORLANDO ,Fla.
Anthony civil case
will go to trial
early next year
A Florida judge says a defama-
tion lawsuit filed against Casey
Anthony can go to trial early next
year.
Judge Lisa Munyon released
her ruling yesterday. Zenaida
Fernandez-Gonzalez claims she
was damaged by Anthony telling
detectives that ababysitter bythe
same name kidnapped Anthony's
2-year-old daughter Caylee.
The detectives were investigat-
ing the 2008 disappearance of the
girl, who later was found dead.
Last year, Anthony was acquitted
of Caylee's murder.
Anthony's attorney said details
offered by Anthony did not match
Fernandez-Gonzalez and clearly
showed Anthony wasn't talking
about her. Gonzalez's attorneys
say she still was damaged as the
only person with that name inter-
viewed by investigators.
MOSCOW
Russia to spend
$1 billion on new
cosmodrome
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
said yesterday his nation will
* spend about $1 billion this year
alone to build a new space launch
pad in the far east that should
ease the Russian space program's
reliance on ex-Soviet neighbor
Kazakhstan.
Putin told government officials
in televised remarks yesterday
that the first rocket launch from
the Vostochny cosmodrome is
set to be conducted by 2015, and
in 2018 it should launch a first
manned mission.
Officials have put the total cost
of the project at about $10 billion.
Putin said Russia will continue

to use the Soviet-built Baikonur
launch pad it leases from Kazakh-
stan, but added that a new launch
facility of its own is needed to
secure the national space pro-
gram's independence.
ROME
Italian party
expels official in
funds scandal
The Northern League, an
anti-immigrant, anti-corruption
movement in Italy, expelled from
its ranks yesterday a top Senate
official implicated in an investiga-
tion of suspected embezzlement of
party funds.
A League statement yesterday
said Rosy Mauro, vice president of
the Italian Senate, had repeatedly
rebuffed pleas to resign his par-
liamentary post, including from
party founder Umberto Bossi. The
League's leadership then ordered
her expulsion from the party.
Mauro has insisted she will clear
her name.
Bossi himself quit last week as
secretary, the League's top post,
after denying using party funds
for personal use. His support had
kept media mogul Silvio Berlusco-
ni in power in three governments.

MAIZE DAY
From Page 1
of the night. In his address, he
reflected on the importance of
celebrating the University com-
munity.
"We talk about how great
Michigan is, but we never stop as
a community to reflect on what
we do," Watson said. "Having a
forum to celebrate students is a
great thing, and I hope it's a tra-
dition that carries on."
Amid all of the maize-clad
attendees, four daring Wolver-
ines decided to showcase their
school spirit in banana costumes,
drawing a significant amount of
attention.
"As graduating /seniors, it's
important to show our spirit,"
Avery Robinson, LSA senior and
banana enthusiast, said. "And
we're so 'a-peeling."'
Tandem bike in tow, Taylor
Lewan, the Michigan football
team's left tackle, took to the
stage to announce the many
accolades of the University's
varsity sports teams, highlight-
ing the football team's Sugar
Bowl victory.
"I don't know if you guys were
there or not, but I was," Lewan
told the applauding crowd. "I'm
a Sugar Bowl champion, and
that's awesome."
Nick Willis, 2008 Olympic sil-
ver medalist in the 1500 meter
run and University alum, also
made a special appearance at
the event and spoke about the
University's continued excel-
lence.
"When I was here, there was
only one Mexican restaurant,"
Willis joked. "But what hasn't

changed here is the reputation
of excellence."
As a native New Zealander,
Willis noted that he will always
be proud of being a University
alum.
"I'm from another country
over there on the other side of
the world, but I'm still a Wolver-
ine," Willis said.
Other campus leaders gave
speeches espousing the many
accomplishments of the Uni-
versity's multicultural affairs,
Greek Life system, performance
arts community and Engineer-
ing program. The marching
band also made an appearance
to lead the crowd in "The Vic-
tors."
At the end the evening, Direc-
tor of Athletic Counseling Greg
Harden spoke about the bond
he's made with the University
and its students over the years.
"I love Michigan," Harden
said. "I love what it stands for.
I love the fact that it had a pro-
found impact on my life."
Harden encouraged stu-
dents to attend as many sport-
ing events, beyond just men's
football, basketball and hockey
games, as possible during their
collegiate years.
"I need you to experience
Michigan and get out of your
comfort zone," he said. "You
need to make sure you don't
waste your time ... I need you to
live life to the fullest."
As the night came to its con-
clusion, Baker said the evening's
events exceeded her expecta-
tions.
"I would have loved to see
more people," Baker said as
the crowd dispersed. "But that
comes with more time."

Victims found

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP)
- Two Coast Guard members
were fatally shot yesterday at a
communications station on an
island off Alaska in what offi-
cials said appeared to be a dou-
ble homicide. They said they
have yet to identify a suspect.
The victims were found at
their work areas inside the
Kodiak Island station early
yesterday by another Coast
Guard member, spokeswoman
Sara Francis said.
While the roughly 60 enlist-
ed personnel and civilians

was involved in the shooting.
The base, about 8 miles
from the island's largest city of
Kodiak, and an adjacent school
were on lockdown. Officials
called on the city's 6,300 or so
residents to remain calm and
vigilant.
Francis said added security
was in place at the base and the
school. She declined to provide
specifics.
The station listens for radio
transmissions from mariners
and aircraft, Petty Officer
Charly Hengen said. The staff
is responsible for relaying dis-
tress calls to other Coast Guard
stations and offices.
The station has "secure
front doors," Hengen said,
and requires staff and visitors
to show identification. Fran-
cis said visitors and those not
actually working at the station
are usually provided escorts.
The Coast Guard said the

victims' identities would be
released after family members
were notified.
The FBI said agents were
headed to Kodiak from Anchor-
age, about 250 miles away.
Rear Adm. Thomas Oste-
bo, the commander of Coast

Santos.

Missile failed
during ascent,
no impact on Japan
PYONGYANG, North Korea
(AP) - North Korea fired a long-
range rocket early today South
Korean and U.S. officials said,
defying international warnings
against moving forward with a
launch widely seen as a provoca-
tion.
Liftoff took place at7:39 a.m.
from the west coast launch pad
in the hamlet of Tongchang-ri,
South Korea's Joint Chiefs of
Staff in Seoul said, citing South
Korean and U.S. intelligence.
However, the launch may
have failed, U.S. officials said in
Washington. South Korean offi-
cials said they could not confirm
that.
Japan's Defense Minister
Naiki Tanaka said, "We have
confirmed that a certain flying
object has been launched and
fell after flying for just over a
minute." He did not say what
exactly was launched.
He said there was no impact
on Japanese territory from the
launch.
In Pyongyang, there was no
word about a launch, and state
television was broadcasting
video for popular folk tunes.
North Korean officials said they
would make an announcement
about the launch "soon."
North Korea had earlier
announced it would send a
three-stage rocket mounted
with a satellite as part of cel-

ebrations honoring national
founder Kim Il Sung, whose
100th birthdayis being celebrat-
ed Sunday.
Space officials say the rocket
is meant to send a satellite into
orbit to study crops and weather
patterns - its third bid to launch
a satellite since 1998.
The United States, Britain,
Japan and others, however, have
called such a launch a violation
of U.N. resolutions prohibiting
North Korea from nuclear and
ballistic missile activity.
Experts say the Unha-3 carri-
er is the same type of rocket that
would be used to launch a long-
range missile aimed at the U.S.
and other targets. North Korea
has tested two atomic devices
but is not believed to have mas-
tered the technology needed to
mount a nuclear warhead on a
long-range missile.
Secretary of State Hillary
Rodham Clinton has warned
that the launch would be a
direct threat to regional securi-
ty and said the U.S. would pur-
sue "appropriate action" at the
U.N. Security Council if North
Korea goes ahead with it.
According to projections, the
first stage of the rocket is due to
fall into the ocean off the west-
ern coast of South Korea, while
the second stage of the rocket
was due to fall into waters off
the eastern coast of the Philip-
pine island of Luzon.
North Korean space officials
have dismissed assertions that
the launch is a cover for devel-
oping missile technology as
"nonsense."of Kodiak.

Don't judge cabook...
Skill, not appearance, must dictate employment
besity is an endemic public health issue in the United States. A
new controversial policy at a hospital in Victoria, Texas bans
people with a body mass index greater than 35 from being
hired in an attempt to tackle the issue of obesity. The hospital argues
that its hiring policy was implemented to promote a professional,
health-conscious image of the employees working at Citizens Medical
Center. Though obesity is a growing problem in the United States and
needs to be addressed, Citizens Medical Center's actions only further
an underlying bias against those who are overweight. Using discrimi-
natory methods to prohibit a group of people from seeking employ-
ment is neither a viable nor fair solution to this problem.

Reduce, reuse, re-educate

love recycling.
I have a purse and an
umbrella made from recycled
water bottles, a collection of recy-
cled-newspaper
pencils and each
fall I'm excited
by the prospect
of purchasing
new recycled
notebooks.
I pick up water
bottles from the KRISTEN
street and stoop KILEK
down to rescue
paper tumble-
weeds on my way to class - but I
have to admit that I don't always
rinse the residue from my peanut
butter jars.
I didn't realize this mattered until
last week when I took a tour of Ann
Arbor's Materials Recovery Facil-
ity. This is where our milk cartons,
condiment jars, soon-to-be-banned
water bottles and all other accept-
able recyclables are delivered, then
sorted out and sent off for a new pur-
pose in life.
Though I thought I was well
versed on Ann Arbor's recycling
prior to my visit, some of my small
oversights have been burdening the
system. Materials received with
food residues, for example, must
be hauled to a landfill. They don't
accept plastic caps or lids either. The
Materials Recovery Facility must
pay to dispose of these items due to
my occasional error.
Education and clarity are key to
any successful recycling program
- but are they really enough? No
matter how hard a busy American
citizen works to keep up with their
local facility's changing and detailed
requirements, many still miss the
fine print. Some won't ever be moti-
vated to self-educate themselves
about recycling.
With consumer-driven recycling
limited by these constraints, I have
to wonder: Would it be more appro-
priate for manufacturers to facili-
tate recycling programs given their
much greater knowledge base, direct

interest and ability to provide con-
sumer incentives?
Many writers, politicians and
industry leaders have tinkered with
this concept. William McDonough,
author of "Cradle to Cradle: Remak-
ing the Way We Make Things" is
fervent about the benefits of urging
manufacturers to take responsibil-
ity for their products at life's-end.
McDonough's ultimate and lofty
ideal is to completely eliminate the
idea of waste by restructuring man-
ufacturing to cut out practices that
necessitate third-party recycling
services in the first place.
Countries including Sweden
and the Netherlands have devel-
oped policies regarding automobile
disposal, which embody some of
McDonough's values. In the 1990s,
the Netherlands introduced a "dis-
posal fee" into the cost of new cars
purchased in the country to cover
expenses for dismantling, transport-
ing and recycling old autos.
Sweden has used a "deposit-
refund" system since the 1970s. This
system necessitates that the produc-
er or importer of a car pays a "recy-
cling fee" to the vehicle Disposal
Fund. The fund pays the final owner
to extract materials from their car
once it's deregistered at the end of
its life.
In Japan's Fuji-Xerox plants, a
longer-range economic perspective
is adapted than in the United States.
Its assembly facilities include prod-
uct take-back and disassembly units.
The products are broken down into
component parts and then manufac-
tured for future sale. Though their
disassembly processes aren't com-
pletely cost effective yet, the com-
pany aims to make its system more
efficient and anticipates benefits
from future legislation that will help
drive down its costs.
Companies shouldn't be able
to profit without paying the com-
plete costs. Legislation should
require more manufacturers to take
responsibility for their end waste.
Of course, these systems still
involve consumer education and

compliance. The main difference
from municipal or separate, priva-
tized materials recovery programs,
though, is that a recycling process
managed by the manufacturer can
be more standardized, with clearer
consumer incentives explained on a
more palatable scale.
It's in our
financial interest
to support
recycling.
In Michigan, the trash disposal
fee, or tipping fee, has been notori-
ously low for years, making our state
a dumping ground and particularly
difficult region for profitable recy-
cling. In September 2011, a motion
to increase Michigan's $.07 per ton
tipping fee to $.12 per ton was signed
by Republican Gov. Rick Snyder. But
according to a study conducted by
Columbia University's Earth Insti-
tute and Biocycle, a waste industry
jounral, the average U.S. tipping fee
in 2010 was $44.09/ton. Michigan's
fee is a pittance.
Considering how well money
speaks in the United States, higher
tipping fees could also be part of
the waste disposal puzzle. It could
increase recycling volumes and also
present an incentive for industries
to use materials that can be profit-
ably recycled.
For the time being, though, the
Ann Arbor community is paying for
the city's materials recovery ser-
vices. It's our civic duty and direct
financial interest to educate our-
selves and support the most efficient
recycling system we can.
So, excuse me while I go review
its guidelines.

According the Texas Tribune, the hos-
pitals policy states that "(an employee's)
physique 'should fit with a representational
image or specific mental projection of the job
of a healthcare professional,' including an
appearance 'free from distraction' for hospi-
tal patients."
Opponents are reaching out to the federal
Equal Employment Opportunity Commis-
sion and looking to the federal Americans
with Disabilities Act for protection from the
provision. Their main issue with the law is
its specific assertion of "appearance" as the
reason for a policy change. In places such as
Washington, D.C. for example, there is a law
against discrimination based on any surface
level characteristic - otherwise known as
the "ugly law."
It's wrong for any employment policy to
discriminate based solely on an individual's
outer appearance. There is not implicit cor-
relation between how a person looks and
their ability to perform their'job. Employers
make decisions on how well an individual is
able to do the job, not on how they look. Some
opponents also believe that the hospital's
policy may be illegal. While Michigan is cur-

rently the only state in the nation that explic-
itly bans weight discrimination explicitly,
and other equal employment laws through-
out the nation may raise concern about the
hospital policy.
An unnecessary stigma against overweight
individuals already exists in society. Taking
extreme actions - such as barring employ-
ment - to further discriminate against those
who are overweight will only perpetuate the
negative stereotypes. Obesity is a problem that
needs to be addressed in a more positive man-
ner. Promotinglhealthier food options, encour-
aging nutrition education and highlighting
physical activity are all ways to better edu-
cate people on how to live a healthy life. The
actions taken by this Texas hospital don't solve
the problem; instead, they only create a larger
stigma against obese people.
Obesity is considered a chronic disease
by the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention and it must be taken seriously. Still,
companies shouldn't bar qualified potential
employees based solely on weight. Obesity
in the United States is a growing epidemic,
but discriminatory practices should not be
instilled as a means to an end for this problem.

Order article violates
Journalistic stGndards
TO THE DAILY:
As the former editor in chief of The Michi-
gan Daily, I am deeply disappointed by The
Statement story published in Wednesday's
edition of the paper. When approached about
the story in January, I was told the story
would discuss what Order of Angell has done
on campus since the organization has become
more transparent and would include inter-
views with several members of our organiza-
tion. The writer did neither of those things
in her article. Instead, the reporter misled
me and other sources by misrepresenting
what her story was about. While I know from
experience that story angles often evolve
before publication, it is against journalistic
ethics to mislead sources about the angle of a
story. Seven other current members of Order
of Angell were interviewed for the article and
told the reporter about work the organiza-
tion has done this year - including fostering
leadership development for students in the
third annual Leaders for Life event, start-
ing an annual scholarship for campus lead-
ers and raising more than $3,000 for Relay
for Life. And though the reporter told several
individuals that the story would focus on this
work, the writer only included one sentence
about some of the initiatives toward the end
of the piece.

I do not deny that Order of Angell has
a controversial past. However, by simply
rehashing that past and not providing any
new facts or infortmation about the group, the
story fails to offer any real value. In addition,
the article was clearly biased. By omitting
several interviews from members who dis-
cussed their involvement in the organization
and what the group does today, the writers
and editors framed the story in a way meant
to discredit the organization.
While the piece also personally attacks me
by questioning my ethics and editing prac-
tices, I would like to point out the conflict of
interest for those who wrote and edited the
story. Dylan Cinti, a co-managing editor of
The Statement, has been an outspoken critic
of Order of Angell in the past. Though this
vocal criticism demonstrates a bias against
the organization, he edited and contributed
reporting to the story. This is a clear viola-
tion of journalistic ethics, and other editors
who knew of his bias should have intervened.
I will always hold the Daily in high regard,
and I do believe it's very important to have rig-
orous debates about potential conflicts of inter-
est, but I am saddened to see that one of the
best college newspapers in the country overtly
ignored the journalistic principles of objectiv-
ity and fairness in publishing this piece.
Stephanie Steinberg
LSA senior and former editor in chief of The
Michigan Daily

As graduation looms just
around the corner for
seniors, I can't help but to
think, "I'm so
glad I'm not one
of them."
Like most stu-
dents, I change
my idea of what I
want to be when
I "grow up"
more times than ADRIENNE
is probably sane. ROBERTS
After listening
to career panels,
I can usually eliminate three differ-
ent jobs I once thought I might have
had an interest in. Internships have
taught me more about what I know
I don't want in a job than what I can
actually envision myself doing in
the future.
I have a high and definitely unre-
alistic expectation that my first job
out of college will be my dream job.
And I know it's unreasonable think-
ing. But I view a career as finding
something similar to a soul mate.
The thought of never finding a career
that's fulfilling and exciting scares
me more than never finding a human
companion. Many other students feel
the exact same way.
MTV recently released a study
called "No Collar Workers" (ouch),
which surveyed 509 people in the
millennial generation, who they
defined as people in their twenties
and thirties. The results proved
that people my age are feeling the
same way I am, even if comes at the
cost of actually having a job. Half
of those surveyed would rather not
have a job than have one they hate.
Eighty percent of millennial work-
ers want regular feedback and rec-
ognition at their workplace.
The study also finds that millen-
nial workers believe their bosses
can learn something from them,
and many want to decide how to

do projects at work. The results
painted a picture that made my
generation seem self-absorbed, ide-
alistic and, well, quite possibly out
of touch.
It's unsettling to read studies
like these because there's such a
dichotomy between what we want
and what we can reasonably expect.
We're still feeling the effects of a
recession. We crave creative oppor-
tunities. Jobs are scarce. We need
a career that fulfills us. The list,
unfortunately, goes on.
But really, it's more than just
thinking we're intellectual won-
ders. We want something out of our
careers that previously hasn't been
discussed. It's not about working
9 to 5 and bringing home a decent
paycheck anymore. We want to form
connections with our work. We crave
collaboration with others, including
our supervisors. And we don't want
to blindly follow calling orders.
Many of us have been raised to
embrace our uniqueness, and most
of the classes at the University sup-
port this. Many are theory-based,
emphasizing critical thinking and
writing. Even this week, the Uni-
versity was praised for its teaching
style on The Colbert Report. But,
this kind of learning doesn't always
translate to technical and specific
skills needed for many jobs.
It's not impossible to reconcile
these competing interests. The big-
gest thing I think we can do as stu-
dents soon entering the workforce
is to realize that our first job may
not be our dream job. And that's a
little difficult to imagine for some.
I've always had this romantic idea
of finding an entry-level job at a
company or government agency
I loved and then working my way
up. That's just not the case for most
people, nor is it practical.
We need some sort of income,
thus we need jobs. We can't afford

to be selective to such an extent
that we inhibit ourselves from
gaining valuable experience, wher-
ever it may come from.
We crave
creative input in
our jobs.
Employers need to understand
that we have valuable skill sets that
can be intentionally enhanced in
certain ways. Collaborative work-
ing and creative input are what we
desire, thus making the results of
our work much richer and, conse-
quently, more valuable.
Post-college life is frightening.
Even though I still have plenty of
time left to decide where my life
is heading, I consider more career
prospects than I probably should.
We, as a generation, are much more
active in obtaining internships and
preparing for careers early on. So
it's intimidating to hear that what
we yearn for in a job may not exact-
ly match reality.
Ultimately, it's important to
remember that with any story of
happiness, you have to go through
a few - or many - bad relation-
ships to eventually find it. It's just
as important to remember that in
the end, there is a career out there
for you, and now is the time to take
the classes and participate in the
extra-curricular activities you love.
Because if you are indifferent to
the career path you will soon be on,
you may be stuck in a bad marriage
with no escape in sight.

"I apologize to Ann Romney and anyone
else who was offended. Let's declare peace
in this phony war and go back to focus on
the substance."

Wednesday that Ann Romeny has "never worked a day in her life."

of the group and made "slander-
ous, offensive remarks" about
the organization
As for the event that she sup-
posedly committed funding to,
Jankowski said the executive
board knew that she been talking
to a member of the Washtenaw
GOP about hosting an event
tomorrow, but that no money
was ever given to the county-
wide organization.
"I never committed any
unauthorized use of funding,"
Jankowski said. She added that
even if she had, "it's common
practice for us to be reimbursed
by the Washtenaw GOP."
Jankowski also refuted the
claims that she blocked other
members from using the Col-
lege Republicans' social media
accounts.
"I have no access to the Face-
book or Twitter accounts cur-
rently and I have not had it since
they claim to not have had access
to it," Jankowski said.
Furthermore, Jankowski said
the she originally planned on
bringing the speaker in question,
Gary Glenn, a candidate for the
Republican nomination for the
U.S. Senate to the meeting with
Hayes.
"(Hayes) approved the event
and he was actually the one who
said we should go along with it,"
Jankowski said. "It's incredibly
funny that now I'm the only one
that was planning it."
University alum Sarah Led-
ford, now youth vice chair of the
Michigan Republican Party, met
with Jankowski in Ann Arbor
and advised her on "parliamen-
tary procedure" regarding the
situation.
"(There was) an attempted
power grab by two members of
the executive board ... Two mem-
bers of the e-board bullied two
other members of the e-board
into attempting to oust another
member of the e-board who was
voted by a vast majority of the
general membership," Ledford
said. "(They) attempted to oust
her literally within five days ofher
chairmanship."
In an e-mail obtained by The
Michigan Daily, Hayes informed
Jankowski that she was being
impeached on Sunday, and he
requested she attend a meeting on
Monday to discuss the impeach-
ment. The e-mail stated that she
was being removed for violating
the constitution, and failing to
perform her proper duties.
Jankowski replied that she

would not be able to meet Mon-
day or Tuesday, so they decided
to meet on Wednesday, follow-
ing the organization's regularly
scheduled meeting.
Jankowski said she went to the
Center for Campus Involvement
for advice regarding the situa-
tion on Wednesday morning, after
which she decided to attempt to
amend the constitution to ensure
decisions about her impeachment
involved all members of the orga-
nization.
At 9:45 p.m. on Wednes-
day, after the amendment was
approved, the four voting mem-
bers of the executive board met
with Jankowski to discuss her
removal.
Less than an hour later, the
College Republicans held an
executive board meeting that
Jankowski did not attend. During
the meeting, which was adjourned
at 1:50 a.m., the board formally
removed Jankowski from office.
Jankowski said an e-mail call-
ing for the meeting was sent out at
10:29 p.m. and that the meeting in
the Michigan Union was called to
order six minutes later. She added
that she was not aware of the
meeting until after 11 p.m.
"How do they read their e-mail
immediately and get over to the
Union?" Jankowski said. "It just
seems a little ridiculous, a little
bit fishy and a little bit premedi-
tated."
Regardless, Jankowski said she
plans on fulfilling her term.
"I remain committed to serv-
ing as chair for this organization
which democratically elected
me," Jankowski said. "(I) will not
allow four power hungry indi-
viduals to override the rule of the
vast majority of the club."
While the newly amended con-
stitution prevented the executive
board from removing Jankowski
without a general membership
vote, Hayes said the amendment
didn't abide by the organization's
constitution because it was not
publicized before the meeting,
a process required by Robert's
Rules of Order, a general body of
laws for governing an organiza-
tion.
"Essentially, without notice
or call to order as clearly defined
in Robert's Rules of Order ... Ms.
Jankowski and Mr. Koziara (a
senior advisor for the College
Republicans) tried changing the
Constitution fraudulently," Hayes
wrote.
Ledford, however, contended
that the meeting had no legiti-
macy.
"They're literally sitting in a
room and talking to each other
and raising up their hands with

no parliamentary authority to do
so," Ledford said.
Ledford said she advised
Jankowski "to maintain the
integrity of the College Repub-
licans," and added that execu-
tive board members harassed
Jankowski, stalked her outside
her classes and sent her hostile
e-mails.
While Ledford said she
involved herself in the dispute
because she felt it was her duty
to do so, Hayes wrote she has no
place in the issue.
"Quite honestly, I believe that
she was only invited to serve as
parliamentarian for the attempt
to fraudulently change the con-
stitution at the meeting earlier
today," Hayes wrote. "Sarah Led-
ford holds no power or sway over
any (College Republican) chapter
in the state of Michigan and it
is, frankly, inappropriate for her
to once again insert herself into
these situations."
Before the executive board
formally voted to remove her,
Jankowski said they had already
begun the impeachment process.
She added that her name was
removed from the College Repub-
lican's Student Organization
Accounts Service list - a six-per-
son list that allows the group to
book rooms for its meeting at the
University and use club funds -
on Tuesday at 3 a.m.
Ledford said this internal fight
within the College Republicans is
unprecedented.
"This is a very extreme situ-
ation in regards to a power grab
and just complete lack of con-
sideration for the wishes of the
general membership of the Col-
lege Republicans," Ledford said.
"Particularly across the state,
there is nothing like happening
at all in other College Republican
groups."
Despite the intense internal
strife, Jankowski said public
knowledge of the issue is good for
the organization.
"We are trying to give trans-
parency and legitimacy to the
organization," Jankowski said.
"If there is an impeachment of
an executive board member, it is
only fair that the general mem-
bership knows about it."
Despite the leadership kerfuf-
fle, Hayes wrote that he is opti-
mistic.
"I'm proud of this organiza-
tion's standards and the awesome
potential we have to broaden the
political dialogue on campus,"
Hayes wrote. "I'm disappointed
Ms. Jankowski was not able to
live up to those standards, but I'm
excited for the year ahead with
such a dedicated group of people."

someone like myself, as we've
occupied this building for so
long and it feels like a part of our
identity of who we are," she said.
"We are located close to the Uni-
versity for that purpose of being
a prophetic voice to speak to the
University in the matter of our
Christian faith."
Though nostalgic, she said she
is accepting of the new occupants.
"But with times and circum-
stances changing and because of
having to give up the building, I
feel very good about what I hear
are plans for the building," she
said.
Congregation member Jack
Walls attended the ceremony

she told her husband to make sure

the fact that Adidas did not inten-
tionally shut downthe factory, it is
responsible for paying the workers
under stipulations of the code.
"When we spoke with (Adidas
representative) Gregg Nebel he
acknowledged that the workers
have not received $1.8 million, but
believes it is the factories respon-
sibility," Fast said. "They openly
admit that these people have not
receivedtheir money,butthey will
not pay."
Upon entering the office of
Gary Krenz, special counsel to the
University president, USAS mem-
bers began reading paragraphs of
their letter aloud to Krenz, who
followed along with a straight
face.
Krenz waited until the end
of the recitation, after which he
asked, "We do share your con-
cerns, how do we achieve the
years ago.
Walls said Sig Ep is an appro-
priate occupant because of the
building's location near other fra-
ternities on Hill Street.
"I think I'm all for it, sim-
ply because this whole street is
becoming Greek," Walls said.
"And why not? We've outlived it,
and so it's logical that it remain
Greek."
It is this sentiment that has
eased the arduous task of find-
ing a new Sig Ep house for Jerry
Mangona, president of Sig Ep's
Michigan Alpha Alumni Board.
Mangona has headed this proj-
ect from its conception through
a gamut of funding and zoning
issues.
"There were six weeks where
we had to let go of our old lease,
but this transaction wasn't yet
secured, and we had a lot of pres-
sure in having 44 of our members
wonder where they were goingto
live," Mangonasaid. "Askingthem
not to sign a lease somewhere else
(was) a little dicey."
After enduring four housing
relocations over 12 years, SigEp is
ready to settle down, according to
fraternity officials.

dent and current Interfraternity
Council executive vice president,

According to USAS members,
their goal isto inspire the Univer-
sity to pressure Adidas to pay the
$1.8 million in severanceby releas-
ing a public statement condemn-
ing Adidas's failures to respect the
basic labor rights of the workers
who make Michigan apparel. So
far, the University's committee of
human rights has reviewed the
issue, confirmed that the workers
have notbeen paid and is working
toward a strategy to compensate
them.
"Adidas talks about how they
are giving humanitarian aid to
the workers but that is really
bogus because what they are giv-
ing them is hardly anything com-
pared to what they owe them,"
Varilone said. "Some people have
called it cutting off someone's leg
and giving them aband-aid."
will better unite the brothers.
"The current house that we're
at right now, it's more like abunch
of apartments so the brotherhood
is kind of separated through a
lot of doors, and I feel like a new
house here is goingto open every-
thing up, especially with the com-
mon space."
Before the stone was removed
to retrieve the time capsule dur-
ing the ceremony yesterday, Rev-
erend Martinson said a prayer in
thanks of the congregation's time
in the church, closing with a nod
to the new caretakers of thebuild-
ing.
"Bless the young men who will
be living and working here and
bless them in their journey as you
blessed us in ours," she said out-
side the church yesterday.
The stone was removed after
two attempts, and the box was
opened with a saw from the ren-
ovation project going on inside,
which is being handled by Phoe-
nix Contractors.
"Because there is no exterior
construction to be done, every-
thing is moving very quickly, and
in fact, we are ahead of schedule
right now," Mangona said. "Inte-
rior demolition is already com-
plete and studding and framing
are almost complete. Soon we'll be

GOODNESS
From Page 1
from DoRAK's emphasis on the
importance of genuine kindness.
"Just because somebody made
you mad doesn't mean you can't
hold the door open for somebody
else, or you can't give somebody
else a smile or a high five," Khan
said.
Claire Baker, DoRAK co-
director, said the organization
has plans to continue hosting
further Goodness Day events in
the future.
"It's an event that's growing
It's been getting bigger every
year, and we're really excited to
keep working on it," she said.
Todd Sevig, director of
Counseling and Psychological
Services and chair of the Uni-
versity's Mental Health Work
Group, wrote in an e-mail that
he applauded DoRAK's efforts in
hosting Goodness Day.

"By definition, only good can
come of this for our campus," he
wrote.
Sevig said the event is benefi-
cial because it can help students
manage stress during the end
of the semester amid numerous
exams and projects. He added
that CAPS advises students to
"stay in balance and keep per-
spective ... keep realistic expec-
tations, manage your stress,
manage your time and take
breaks."
DoRAK was originally part of
the service organization Circle
K, but has grown to become an
independent organization with
about 200 members. Members
plan random acts of kindness and
spend approximately one hour
of their week making an effort
to brighten the other students'
days.
Recently, the 10-year-old stu-
dent organization made place-
mats for children at C.S. Mott
Children's Hospital, cheered for

students entering exams and
wrote encouraging chalk mes-
sages in the Diag, according to
DoRAK's February 2012 news-
letter.
LSA junior Alyssa Engstrom
said DoRAK has had a positive
impact on her experience at the
University.
"One day I was having a really
bad day, and some random guy
offered to give me a hug, and it
brightened up my day," she said.
Khan said she appreciates the
diversity she experiences within
the group and enjoys working
with English majors, nurses,
pre-med students and pre-law
students - people she said she
would rarely interact with oth-
erwise.
LSA sophomore Kevin Bur-
khart added that he enjoyed the
free high fives on the Diag, and it
helped improve his spirits.
"It makes me feel great it
brightens up my day and gives
me a good boost," Burkhart said.

The 'Machinal' life UMS to bring diverse

Rude Mechanicals
to present dystopian
story at Mendelssohn
By JOEY STEINBERGER

Wake up. Go to class. Eat.
Study. Go to bed. Repeat. Some-
times, life in college can feel like
a mechanical
repetition of Machinal

days on end. Tonight and

daily routine to Teatre
go see someone Theatre
else's in the From $3
Rude Mechani-
cals' production of"Machinal."
An expressionist work written
by playwright Sophie Treadwell,
"Machinal" follows a woman
stuck in a post-industrial society.
She works as a secretary, per-
forming the same repetitive tasks
day after day. Eventually, she
breaks from her ritualistic exis-
tence by murdering her husband.
"The main character goes to
work as a secretary, and every-
one around her has one job," said
Education junior Grace Hawkins,
one of the producers of the show.
"There is the telephone girl who
says the same things over and
over and the lawyers who are
mechanical in nature. You think
of the 'It's a Small World After
All' ride. "
Last semester, the Rudes per-
formed "Hamlet" as inspired
by "Mad Men." They updated
the troubled Danes' looks with
1960s-style men's suits and wom-

en's cocktail dresses. For each
show, they try to pursue a differ-
ent creative direction.
"(We're) using video projec-
tions of footage the director took
in Japan over Christmas break,"
Hawkins said. "It represents ... a
society where you are a cog in the
machine."
These video projections are
meant to set the mood of the play,
but they also serve a more uocon-
ventional function: as elements
that interact with the set and
characters in the play.
"Machinal" is Music, Theatre
& Dance senior Sango Tajima's
directorial debut. The show's
producers chose Tajima out of
a pool of five other applicants.
Once chosen by the producers,
the director auditioned actors
and actresses.
"We selected Sango because
we felt really good about it. There
is something very original and
interesting about her approach,"
Hawkins said.
In her application to the pro-
ducers, Tajima wrote: "The
mechanical aspect will not
only be overstated. The actors

play their characters as zombie
robots. I want to have characters
who are as real as possible, but
their actions and speech are very
mechanical. This balance will be
chilling."
The Rude Mechanicals is
entirely student-run. They
receive funding for their shows
from the University Activities
Center. UAC works with the
group to schedule performance
dates as well, since the Rudes
perform in the University-owned
Mendelssohn Theatre.
To make the most of the money
they receive, the students in
the Rudes often help with show
essentials, such as set design.
"One thing the Rudes require
is that the actors and the produc-
tion team have to help build the
set," Hawkins said. "Literally all
the actors will be hammering on
Sunday. They won't be acting;
they will be organizing the cos-
tumes - it's very hands-on."
Now: Read article. Go to class.
Eat. Study. With the mechanical
nature of our own daily routine,
"Machinal" could ring especially
poignant.

SPRING FOOTBALL GAME PREVIEW

by Zach Helfand I Daily Sports Editor

ERIN KIRKLAND/Daily
Fifth-year senior center Ricky Barnum is trying to fil the shoes of Rimington Award-
winning center David Molk.
Ricky Barnum: The center of attention
Expect fifth-year senior Ricky Barnum to be the Goldilocks of Michigan
centers.
Then-redshirt junior Rocko Khoury was too erratic in three forgettable
plays as the emergency center in the Sugar Bowl in early January. And in all
likelihood, Rimington Award-winner Dave Molk's performance last season
was too strong to replicate.
That means Barnum will likely fit in somewhere in the middle - just
right.
Barnum converted to center after Molk's departure left the depth at the
position alarmingly thin. Last season, Barnum started in three games and
played in nine, at both guard and tackle.
Hoke praised Barnum's development on Thursday but said he still had to
work on the consistency of his snaps. As Molk's three-play injury during the
first drive of the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans made painfully clear, a liability
at center can derail an offense.

Junior quarterback Devin Gardner might get
a chance to see time at wide receiver.
Gardner planted at
wide receiver?
Michigan coach Brady Hoke was
wracking his brain for a name on Thurs-
day. He was asked about the develop-
ment of his receivers and his answer
came quick. He rattled off the names of
four wideouts who all saw action last
season. But for 10 seconds, a fifth name
escaped him.
He wasn't actually going to say it, was
he? Was he about to put junior backup
quarterback Devin Gardner in the list?
"Who am I missing?" Hoke asked.
Someone in the press corps helped
him out - the name in question was that
of redshirt sophomore Jerald Robinson.
So for the moment, one of the worst-
kept secrets in the history of worst-kept
secrets remained exactly that. Still, the
major question heading into the Spring
Game is whether Gardner, still listed as
the backup to senior quarterbackDenard
Robinson, will see time at wide receiver.
Though Hoke said he has experi-
mented with Gardner in spring prac-
tices, Hoke and offensive coordinator Al
Borges likely won't want to reveal much
on Saturday.
Still, the 6-foot-4 Gardner has the
speed and athleticism required to make
the switch. And if he does split out wide
for a few plays, that could signal more
consistent time in the fall. So keep an eye
out for No. 7 along the line of scrimmage
on Saturday.

Junior defensive tackle Jibreel Black made the movefrom the defensive end position
into the interiorof the defensive line in the off-season.
Jibreel Black: Michigan's inside man
Can junior defensive lineman Jibreel Black transition to the interior
alongside senior defensive tackle Will Campbell?
The undersized Black, who will move from the edge to tackle after the
graduation of three starting defensive linemen - Ryan Van Bergen, Mike
Martin and Will Heininger - is listed at 260 pounds. Compare that to Mar-
tin, the nose tackle last season, who was listed at 304. (And analysts still
consider Martin undersized entering the NFL Draft.)
Hoke said he likes the speed that Black injects into the defense, but he
concedes that he will be more effective in the fall after adding more weight
and strength. Black substituted in at defensive end in 13 games last season
during which he collected 18 tackles and a sack and a half.
Black gets his first test against upper-echelon Big Ten talent on Saturday,
when he tries to clog up the middle against redshirt junior running back
Fitzgerald Toussaint. Up next after that? Alabama on Sept. 1. Better to get
your reps in early.

Michigan coach Brady Hoke likes what he has seen out of his three early enrollees this
spring during their first spring camp.
Early enrollees as Michigan's prom kings
Michigan's early enrollees can't bring a date, but Saturday will have to
substitute for a high school rite of passage.
"If you think about it, they'd be going to prom," Hoke said.
Hoke was referring to freshmen Joe Bolden and Jarrod Wilson - listed
as four-star recruits - and Kaleb Ringer, a three-star.,
Each graduated early for a chance to join the Wolverines this semester.
Each arrived in Ann Arbor in early January, began taking classes and have
joined the team for the duration of spring camp.
Hoke said that he is "proud" of the way each has transitioned, but Satur-
day will be the first real test for the freshmen. Bolden and Ringer each play
linebacker, and Wilson will take reps at safety.
The early enrollees will be joined by the rest of their freshman class dur-
ing the summer and early fall. The class was a top-five class nationally, and
will bring plenty of attention and talent to town.

Sophomore defensive end Brennen Beyer is battling sophomore defensive end Frank
Clark for the starting weakside defensive end position.
Competition at weakside defensive end
With Black moving to the interior and senior defensive end Craig Roh
playing the strongside end, sophomore defensive linemen Brennen Beyer
and Frank Clark have been fighting to earn the starting spot at weakside
defensive end.
Clark appeared in 12 games last season but didn't make much of a splash
until he intercepted a pass from Virginia Tech quarterback Logan Thomas
in the Sugar Bowl, which led to the Wolverines' second touchdown of the
game.
Beyer played in11games, flip-flopping between defensive end and reserve
linebacker, and collected 11 tackles.
The two have remained relatively even in spring practice. Hoke said one
player has the edge one day, then it switches the next. The Spring Game will
be an opportunity for one to establish himself as the presumptive starter
over the summer.

The Spring Game is just one
event of what Hoke has termed
Victors' Weekend. The program
will be welcoming back about
350 former players, beginning
with a gathering on Friday
night.
Before the scrimmage on
Saturday, about 100 of those
players will be participating in
the annual alumni flag-football
game.
Later, the program will hold
what it has termed Victors'
Night, where former coach Gary
Moeller will be honored.
If it were up to Hoke, though,
the weekend might look a little
different.
Some college coaches have
floated the idea of scrimmag-
ing other teams in the spring
instead of just playing against
themselves, believing it would
be more beneficial for those
involved.
Hoke said he'd prefer an NFL
model.
During training camp every
summer, NFL teams are per-
mitted to bring in an opponent
for multiple days, during which
they practice and scrimmage
with each other.
"I think it would be a great
idea, to be honest with you,"
Hoke said. "I don't know (if it's
feasible) from a budget stand-
point and all those things, if
you're traveling and doing those
kinds of things, (or) who you
would do it with. (But) I like
that model."
In lieu of intersquad competi-
tion, the Wolverines will have to
make due with their own roster.
With the offseason ahead, Sat-
urday marks the last real chance
for Hoke and his staff to assess
that roster before fall camp
comes around.

hander Bobby Brosnahan - the
Wolverines (2-4 Big Ten, 15-19
overall) will need to see produc-
tion from unexpected sources if
they want to leave State College
with a series win.
"Somebody's going to have to
step up," said Michigan coach
Rich Maloney. "Some guys are
going to have to take advantage of
the opportunity - an opportunity
that theyusually don't get."
And after Wednesday's 6-2 loss
to Toledo, you can now add fresh-
man left fielder Will Drake to the
list of infirmed. Just three days
after O'Neill went to the bench
with a bruised left hand, Drake
came up limping after grounding
out to second base. Though Drake
hasn't been officially ruled out for
any of the three games against the
Nittany Lions (2-4, 13-19), Malo-
ney isn't too optimistic.
"I don't know the extent of it
because I haven't talked to the
trainer, but he was hurting pretty
bad when he was coming off,"
Maloney said. "I have a feeling
that he will be out for a while.
I don't know that for a fact, but
that's just my guess."
Adding insult to injury, Michi-

Michigan coach Rich Maloney is dealing with a rash of injuries on his team.

gan enters the weekend on a
three-game slide, having scored
just three runs in its last two
games. Though the injuries to
O'Neill and Drake have had a sig-
nificant impact on the lineup, the
Wolverines' offensive woes have
been a problem all season. In the
past 10 games, they have scored
more than four runsjust twice.
"We're going to have to pitch
really well, play good defense and
scrap at the plate," Maloney said.
"We're going to have to scrap at
the plate and make the most of our
opportunities."
Michigan will lean on its pitch-
ing staff to get it through the
weekend. Fifth-year senior right-
hander Brandon Sinnery will be
handed the ball on Friday, tasked
with snapping the skid. In his
last start, a 4-0 victory against
Michigan State, the right-hander
allowed nine hits but didn't give
up a run in 8.1 innings of work.
Freshman left-hander Trent
Szkutnik is scheduled to start on
Saturday, and the Sunday starter
has yet to be determined.
Penn State will also be looking
to bounce back from a nonconfer-
ence loss this weekend. The Nit-
tany Lions fell to Pittsburgh on
Wednesday, 5-3, which snapped
their six-game winning streak.

But since losing 14 of their first 17
contests, Penn State has turned
around its season and is now 8-2
at home.
The Wolverines will look to
limit the production of first base-
man Jordan Steranka. Steranka
is the only Nittany Lion batting
above .300, and he leads the team
in batting average (.358), RBIs (22)
and home runs (4). Besides Steran-
ka, the batting order is barren. As
a team, Penn State ranks near the
bottom in the Big Ten in almost
every major offensive category.
On the mound, Penn State will
likely throw out Joe Kurrasch,
Steven Hill and John Walter.
Kurrasch's 2.49 ERA and .217
opposing batting average rank in
the top five in the conference, and
Walter's 44 strikeouts place him
third.
Though the roadtrip will con-
clude a stretch of eight games inl10
days, redshirt sophomore second
baseman John DiLaura doesn't
think weariness will be a problem
for the Wolverines.
"(Fatigue) is a little bit of a fac-
tor," DiLaura said. "I think more

in Ann Arbor
with a double-
header.
Though Michigan State is
winless in conference play,
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins
won't let that deter her game
plan and preparation.
"I think Michigan State plays
up to the competition well,"
Hutchins said. "They'll be
extremely hungry, and hopefully
our kids don't think it's a gimme
because they're winless."
Despite Michigan State's will
to win, the Spartans will have to
overcome a glaring weakness in
its pitching staff.
Michigan State possesses
a 6.81 team ERA - more than
two runs behind the next clos-
est school, Indiana - while the
Wolverines lead the Big Ten with
a 1.96 ERA.
Sophomore Cassee Layne and
freshman Carly Nielsen are the
two pitchers who will most likely
take the circle this weekend for
the Spartans.
Layne has still made 20 starts
for Michigan State this season,
recording a 7.43 ERA.
Due to such a high ERA, she
has managed to throw just two
complete games. In her latest
start, against Eastern Michigan
on Wednesday, Layne went one

Senior first baseman Amanda Chidester is leading the offensive charge.

inning and gave up five runs.
Nielsen relieved her and pitched
the remainder of the game while
only allowing one run.
Nielsen, who owns a 5.81 ERA
this season, has started 12 games
while posting a 3-11 record.
Things look better in the
circle for the Wolverines' two
freshmen. Right-hander Sara
Driesenga and left-hander Hay-
lie Wagner have combined to
pick up all but one of Michigan's
27 wins this season, throwing 23
complete games and five shut-
outs between them.
The duo is a big reason why the
Wolverines are on top of the Big
Ten standings with an 8-1 record.
"They definitely workveryhard
and they need to continue to work
to get better," Hutchins said ear-
lier this season.
"They've done a nice job of
picking each other up - they
both had to come in and save each
other, and I think they work very
well together."
Another reason for Michigan's
success has been the team's abil-
ity to get extra-base hits - espe-
cially home runs. After hitting a
season-high four home runs in last
Friday's game against Ohio State,
the Wolverines are now tied for

second in the conference in the
category.
The two big bats for Michigan
have been senior first baseman
Amanda Chidester, who has seven
home runs and 33 RBIs, and junior
second basemanAshley Lane, who
leads theteamwith 10 home runs.
On the other hand, Michigan
State ranks ninth out of 12 teams
in the Big Ten in home runs with
14.
A bright spot in the Spartan
lineup comes from their No. 2 bat-
ter, junior center fielder Kylene
Hopkins, who leads the team in
hits (44) and batting average (.411).
On paper, Michigan seems
to have the upper hand in this
weekend's series, but following
Wednesday's shutout loss against
Western Michigan, anything is
possible.
"We need to show up and play
our game and not worry who we're
playing and what their record is,"
Hutchins saidbefore Wednesday's
loss.
But after that game, Hutchins'
attitude on the Michigan State
series changed.
"If they think they're going to
show up and win, they're going to
get their butts kicked," Hutchins
said.

There's a joke floating around
the Stephen Ross Academic
Center these days. Some of the
counselors frequently suggest to
Michigan coach Joe McFarland
that the Zeerips are a superhuman
breed.
"They have seen what kind

ful they are, how polite they are,
that they're very successful on the
wrestling mat and in the class-
room," McFarland said. "They're
not sure what the parents are
doing, but they want to send their
own kids up there for a summer."
Justin was never too far out-
side his comfort zone at Michigan.
While he redshirted his freshman
year, he grew acclimated to the
University's academic rigors, later
becoming a two-time Academic

But the elite level of Division-I

Rose lashes out about banners


Ex-Fab Five
member opposes 'U'
President Coleman's
banner decision
By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
During her fireside chat with
students on Tuesday, Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Coleman
declared that she does not want to
re-raise the four Michigan men's
basketball team banners that were
removed in 2002.
"From my point of view, tak-
ing the banners down was the
right thing to do because it was a
very difficult time for the univer-
sity and we were ashamed of what
happened because the university
has higher standards than that.
We're the University of Michigan
- that shouldn't happen," Cole-
man said.
When the news hit the public
after the Michigan Daily exclusive
was released Thursday, ex-Fab
Five member Jalen Rose lashed
back.
"I saw that U of Michigan has
no plans to put back up our hoops
banners," Rose tweeted early
Thursday afternoon. "Should I do
like most of its former BBallers &
never return?"
He followed with another post

Ex-Fab Five memberJalen Rose has been an outspoken advocate of re-raising the four removed banners in

a few minutes later.
"Or should I ask for the $250k
I donated for my Endowed Schol-
arship back & move it to another
school? Stay tuned."
The four banners, which were
removed from the Crisler Arena
rafters in the wake of the Ed Mar-
tin scandal and have been stored
at Bentley Historical Library for
the past decade, memorialize the
1992 and 1993 Final Four appear-
ances, the 1997 NIT championship
and the 1998 Big Ten Tournament
championship. Rose, now an NBA

analyst for ESPN, was a member of
the 1992 and 1993 Final Four runs.
In her fireside chat, Coleman
said that the banners represented
a shameful era in the University's
and basketball program's history.
"What happened was not good,
and I don't think they'll ever go
back up. I don't," Coleman said.
"Some day, I won't be president
anymore, and maybe someone else
will have a different view. But I
think you have to reflect on the
larger meaning and that we want
to hold ourselves to a higher stan-

dard."
As part of the NCAA-imposed
sanctions in the wake of the Mar-
tin case, Michigan has had to dis-
sociate itself with four players
- Chris Webber, Maurice Taylor,
Robert "Tractor" Traylor and
Louis Bullock - for 10 years.
That 10-year separation ends in
2013.
Rose finished his Twitter com-
mentary with a single quote from
Frangois de La Rochefoucauld:
"We all have the strength to
endure the misfortunes of others."
