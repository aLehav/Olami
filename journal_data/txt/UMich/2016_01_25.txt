The streak continues

College conducts 
surveys, forums 
to gauge student 

experiences

By CAMY METWALLY

Daily Staff Reporter

In coordination with diversi-

ty initiatives on campus, LSA is 
reviewing the impact of the cur-
rent race and ethnicity require-
ment.

In September 2015, Univer-

sity President Mark Schlissel 
announced goals for individual 
units to collaborate with facul-
ty, staff and students to design 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
plans, which in turn would be 
used to create a comprehensive, 
University-wide strategic plan.

LSA is currently in the pro-

cess of gathering and analyzing 
data to better guide its DEI plan, 
which is due in mid-March. 
Angela Dillard, associate dean 
for undergraduate education, 
said the college is focusing on 

reviewing the race and ethnic-
ity requirement and the Com-
prehensive Studies Program, 
in particular, to improve access 
and equity on campus.

LSA junior Sean Pitt, CSG 

chief of staff and member of the 
R&E review committee, said 
the description of the require-
ment, where it addresses class 
focus, is vague.

“It provides a space in which 

faculty may be able to devi-
ate from the intention of the 
requirement,” Pitt said.

The LSA website describes 

the R&E requirement as a 
course that “addresses issues 
that arise from racial or eth-
nic intolerance.” The classes 
must also satisfy two criteria: 
required content and required 
focus. The required content 
encompasses specific guidelines 
for the class, and the required 
focus calls for R&E courses to 
“devote substantial, but not 
necessarily exclusive, attention 
to the required content.”

Clinton, Sanders vie 

for voter support 
in days leading to 
nation’s first caucus

By SAM GRINGLAS

Daily Staff Reporter

During the past weekend, Mich-

igan Daily journalists spent three 
days in Iowa covering candidates 

from both parties as they prepare 
for the state’s Democratic and 
Republican primaries on Feb. 1, the 
first in the nation. Look for con-
tinuing coverage from the Daily in 
the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses.

CLINTON, Iowa — There 

were two town halls. The first 
occupied an elementary school 
cafeteria; the other filled the 
basement of a Masonic Center 
about a mile away. On Saturday, 
in a town called Clinton, the two 
Democrats leading the race for 

their party’s presidential nomina-
tion convened separately to rally 
supporters and, with just days 
before the Iowa caucuses, draw 
contrasts between two platforms 
that are in many ways similar.

“As we go through this cam-

paign, and especially now in this 
last eight, nine days, we are draw-
ing contrasts, and I think that’s 
appropriate,” 
Hillary 
Clinton, 

former secretary of state, told 
a crowd of 500 gathered in the 
Eagle Heights Elementary cafete-

ria. 

But for much of her 30-min-

ute stump speech, which ticked 
off policy positions on topics like 
clean energy, health care and job 
creation, Clinton avoided direct 
mention of Vermont Sen. Ber-
nie Sanders, who according to a 
recent CNN poll has gained a lead 
in the state. An average of polling 
conducted in January has Clin-
ton with a six-point lead. Martin 
O’Malley, former Maryland gov-

Entrepreneurship 

407 hosts 

competition based 

on “The Voice”

By REBECCA SOLBERG

Daily Staff Reporter

Last 
week, 
Entrepreneur-

ship 407 was turned into a game 
show. T-shirts were flung into 
the crowd and “Eye of the Tiger” 
blared through Stamps Audito-
rium as students took their seats 
in the audience, as part of The 
Startup, an entrepreneurship 
event on campus.

The Center for Entrepreneur-

ship created The Startup, an 
opportunity for undergraduate 
and graduate students to com-
pete for $18,000 to launch their 
own startup business. The com-
petition consists of four rounds 
that each emphasize different 
aspects of starting a business, 
and is run by the class. Students 

from across campus can enter 
products into the competition. 
Auditions to be in the competi-
tion happened on January 12 and 
13, where 50 teams were whit-
tled down to the 21 who partici-
pated in the first round.

“Every round of the competi-

tion stresses something else,” 
Engineering junior Robert Levy, 
who took the class last year, said. 
“One round will stress product 
development, one will stress 
customer discovery, so I learned 
a lot about the steps necessary 
to grow a startup, not just from 
the back end of building a prod-
uct that is valuable but also going 
out and making sure that your 
product has value to other peo-
ple other than yourself.”

During the first round on Fri-

day, the judges had their backs to 
the participants, but if they were 
interested in their idea, they 
turned around and then became 
the team’s mentor for the rest of 
the rounds. If a judge didn’t turn 
around, then the team was elim-

A hundred students, alumni 

and faculty gathered in Keene 
Auditorium on Friday for the 
#WhatIDidThen panel, com-
posed of student-activist alumni 
from various backgrounds and 

professional fields who have 
experience in community ser-

From various backgrounds

lyn, was a founding member of 
Fighting Obstacles Knowing 
Ultimate Success, also known 
as FOKUS, a student advocacy 
group for diversity, creativity 
and unity in a variety of art dis-
ciplines.

When he first arrived on 

campus, Edwards said, he felt 
there was something missing at 
the University, but didn’t know 
what it was. He said he did not 
feel like the University was a 
true community and it was dif-

Talk discusses 

current movement, 

cites need for 

progressive agenda

By EMILY DAVIES

Daily Staff Reporter

About 30 people gathered 

Friday to listen to and engage 
with Matthew Platt, assistant 
professor of political science at 
Morehouse College, on the state 
of Black politics in the modern 
world.

The event emphasized what 

Platt described as a need to con-
tinue to think critically about 
the strategy the Black commu-
nity employs to fight for change.

Throughout his lecture, Platt 

argued that holding protests and 
drawing on Black representation 
in politics both fail to effectively 
advance the “Black-issue agen-
da,” which he defined as matters 
pertaining to anti-racism, cul-
ture and social welfare.

As part of a research project, 

Platt examined every bill intro-
duced in Congress from 1947 to 
1998 and concluded that the vast 

majority of Black-issue bills have 
been introduced by non-Black 
representatives. At the highest 
point, he said, only five Black 
members of Congress chaired 
committees. He said due to this 
statistic, among other factors, 
the power of change falls to non-
Black representatives.

Platt also touched on two 

popular strategies the black 
community has used to gain rec-
ognition from non-Black mem-
bers of Congress: protests and 
politics. Since the passage of the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965, Platt 
said there has been an inverse 
relationship between the num-
ber of protests and legislative 
impact.

“Representation has become 

weaker post-political empower-
ment in terms of getting Black 
issues recognized by Congress,” 
Platt said. “After Black enfran-
chisement, both protests and 
politics are less effective tools 
for gaining white recognition of 
Black issues. This is what I call 
the normalization of Black poli-
tics.”

Platt added this lack of con-

gressional impact has little to do 
with the Black candidates elect-
ed. Even those Black members 

of Congress who Platt labeled 
as “ambitious” in his research, 
meaning those who formed 
an exploratory committee for 
higher office or ran for a higher 
office, are no more likely to fur-
ther a Black-issue agenda.

In a similar vein, Platt said 

the most important part of pro-
gressive politics is not about the 
votes, but rather about pushing 
an agenda to make change.

“If you are defining Black pol-

itics by how many white people 
you can get to vote for you, I fail 
to realize what is Black about 
that,” Platt said. “Instead we 
need to think about Black poli-
tics in terms of how you move 
forward a Black policy agenda.”

Platt did acknowledge, how-

ever, that even if race does not 
matter in Congress, it does mat-
ter in terms of ideology — his 
research demonstrates that in 
general, Black people in Con-
gress are extremely liberal.

After his remarks, Platt’s 

audience, a mixture of under-
graduate students, graduate stu-
dents and professors, engaged 
critically with him on several 
points.

Lecturers talk civil 
rights, activism in 
hopes of exploring 
diverse identities 

By BRANDON SUMMERS-

MILLER

Daily Staff Reporter

On Saturday, the South Asian 

Awareness 
Network’s 
annual 

conference hosted two keynote 
speakers and held multiple semi-
nars to discuss activism, inter-
sectionality and civil rights.

While 
the 
first 
keynote 

focused on South Asian heritage 
and its links to the Civil Rights 
Movement, the second empha-
sized the importance of the 
intersectionality of racial and 
cultural identities. Both lectur-
ers aimed to shed light on social 
entrepreneurship.

LSA senior Fatema Chamak, 

co-director of SAAN, said the 

group’s main aim wasn’t just to 
create a conference that acted 
as a singular event, but rather to 
create one that acted as an exten-
sion of all the events the organi-
zation hosts throughout the year.

Of the conference’s many 

goals, Chamak said she hoped 
participants learned how to 
explore the intersectionality and 
fluidity of their identities. Inter-
sectionality refers to the way 
different identities connect and 
overlap. 

“I want them to walk away 

with the idea that activism isn’t 
over,” Chamak said. “And that 
social identity is something that 
always needs to be reflective and 
explored.”

American 
Culture 
prof. 

Manan Desai, who gave the first 
keynote speech, focused on the 
relationships 
between 
South 

Asian identities and the U.S. 
Civil Rights Movement of the 
1960s.

Desai said African American 

social activists influenced anti-

imperialist activists in Southern 
Asia, exploring the history of 
South Asia and subsequently to 
activism.

“It was not only the case that 

South Asians who came to the 
U.S. were often drawn to the 
conflict fighting injustice,” said 
Desai. “But the history of Afri-
can American struggle had long 
influenced activists back home.”

Desai also told the crowd 

that he wanted to speak at the 
SAAN conference because dur-
ing his time as an undergraduate 
at the University, there wasn’t a 
space for students of South Asian 
descent to discuss the issues that 
faced their community.

Overall, he said he hoped 

participants could learn where 
South Asians fit into the nation’s 
history from his keynote.

“I was trying to say something 

inspiring about people before 
who showed solidarity towards 
African Americans or civil rights 
movements,” Desai said. “I also 
wanted us to think about where 
South Asians fit historically in 
the larger picture.”

Naya 
Jeevan 
CEO 
Asher 

Hasan presented the second 
keynote speech, focusing on his 
own racial and social identities. 
Using his own life as an example, 
he noted how participants could 
make a positive impact on the 
world.

Hasan’s company, Naya Jee-

van, is based in Pakistan and is 
dedicated to empowering mar-
ginalized communities by giving 
them access to health care, edu-
cation and financial inclusion.

While Hasan spoke specifi-

cally to his South Asian heritage, 
he explained he was more com-
fortable now as a person who 
views himself as all his identi-
ties simultaneously, whereas he 
used to think of himself in terms 
of only one or another at a single 
time.

“We can all have multiple iden-

tities,” he said. “It’s just trying to 
get them to converge together 
into an integrated whole.”

Hasan said he wanted to speak 

at SAAN’s conference because he

36 YEARS AGO THIS WEEK (JAN. 24, 1980)

Greek life loses pet policy

After five former members 

of fraternity Alpha Delta Phi 
were involved in killing their 
house cat, the local chapter of 
the Humane Society decided 
to temporarily stop giving 
house pets to University fra-
ternities.

At the time, fraternities 

could put in a request for a 
house pet at the Humane 
Society of Huron Valley. 
Although the Humane Soci-
ety would not grant the 
majority of the requests, sev-
eral fraternities had house 
pets they adopted from the 
organization. After the cat 
killing occurred in early 
December and the five stu-
dents had been expelled from 
Alpha Delta Phi after their 

plea on January 17.

Diane 
Allevato, 
then-

director of the Humane Soci-
ety of Huron Valley, said at 
the time the brutal killing of 
the cat served as a catalyst for 
reviewing the organization’s 
policy.

The 
Humane 
Society 

would 
be 
“committing 

organizational suicide” if it 
allowed fraternities to adopt 
animals so soon after the cat-
killing incident, Allevato said.

Mark Nehmer, non-act-

ing fraternity president of 
Delta Chi, said his fraternity 
sought to adopt an animal 
but though they had a good 
record of taking care of house 
pets and had a recommenda-
tion from an LSA assistant 

dean with their request for a 
new dog, the request wasn’t 
granted. According to Nehm-
er, a Humane Society worker 
said his fraternity would not 
be able to adopt a dog right 
away but may be able to adopt 
one in two months.

Nehmer was disappointed 

that all of the fraternities 
were being punished for the 
actions of a few members.

Nehman claimed that his 

fraternity could appeal to 
the state level of the Humane 
Society and receive a more 
sympathetic response, but 
he did not think it would be 
appropriate to go over the 
local chapter’s head.

Bernstein said the University 
should pay less attention to 
standardized test scores and 
more to skills that “contribute 
to society.”

Newman added the Uni-

versity works closely with the 
Detroit Public Schools and 
will continue its presence in 
the city. Recently, many teach-
ers have spoken out againstthe 
poor conditions of DPS schools 
and how they limit K-12 stu-
dents’ success.

LSA freshman Peter Pujols 

asked what the regents plan to 
do to curb the increasing cost 
of attendance at the Univer-
sity, which experienced a 2.7 
percent and 3.7 percent hike 
in tuition to in-state and out of 
state students, respectively, for 
this year. 

lenged Platt on his research 
surrounding protests, citing the 
success of the Black Lives Mat-
ter movement and the harsh 
backlash surrounding the sick-
outs in Detroit, when teachers 
called in sick in protest of the 
poor school conditions.

Hakeem Jefferson, Ph.D. can-

didate in political science, said 
he didn’t fully agree with Platt’s 
stance on Black politics.

“Matt’s work is provocative. 

It is a re-telling of a story about 
Black politics that many of us 
are familiar with,” Jefferson 
said. “Much of the work in rep-
resentation suggests that rep-
resentation matters, that a sort 
of descriptive representation 
matters. Of course what Matt is 
suggesting is that it doesn’t mat-
ter all that much. We can quibble 
about the parts I agree with and 
disagree with, but at least for 
me it reminds me that move-
ments like Black Lives Matter 
and other radical progressive 
movements, despite Matt’s pes-
simism, are really useful.”

wished to share his experienc-
es with young people, and help 
them navigate the world of 
entrepreneurship from hear-
ing his experiences.

“I always enjoy engaging 

millennials because they’re a 
generation that don’t just want 
to do good for themselves,” 
Hasan said. “They also want 
to do good for others.”

LSA senior David Schafer, 

who attended the conference, 
said he came because he he 
thought it was important to 
discuss social justice issues 
within the South Asian com-
munity.

“Even though we do come 

from a variety of backgrounds 
and identities, we have shared 
lives and experiences,” he 
said. “We need to help each 
other and we need to set out to 
stand in solidarity with each 
other.”

the northeastern United States on 
Saturday, shutting down both New 
York City and the nation’s capital.

The storm deposited up to three 

feet of snow in some areas and 
affected nearly 80 million people, 
with hurricane-like winds reaching 
speeds of 50 mph in New York to 
Virginia and topping out at 75 mph 
in Delaware.

Northeast state officials warned 

citizens to remain inside and off the 
roads in the days leading up to the 
storm’s development.

In New York City, officials 

banned travel in an effort to 
keep people inside and off the 
treacherous roads.

The storm reached parts of 

lower Appalachia, stranding some 
travelers on Pennsylvania, West 
Virginia and Kentucky highways.

Thousands of homes and 

businesses lost power because of 
the storm and over 6,000 weekend 
flights were cancelled.

Despite the warnings, 18 deaths 

have been blamed on the inclement 
weather and thousands of travelers 
were forced to remain in the 
affected region.

Ann Arbor teachers 
frustrated with new 
district evaluation 
system

A group of Ann Arbor teachers 

and parents claim the new 
evaluation system developed by 
the district to coincide with new 
state standards are drastic and 
unnecessary.

Ann Arbor Public Schools 

administrators developed the new 
evaluation system to conform to the 
state government’s 2011 law, which 
revised Michigan’s teacher tenure.

Before the district’s evaluation 

reform, supervisors worked 
closely with teachers to examine 
individualized topics including the 
teacher’s instuction abilities and 
classroom management.

Now, every teacher will be 

evaluated on 76 objectives, which 
the superintendent claims will 
help both students and teachers. 
However, the teacher’s union 
claims it will only hurt both.

While teachers and parents are 

upset and voicing their concerns 
with the new evaluation system, 
administrators say they are 
following the law and the Michigan 
Department of Education’s 
guidance.

However, the Department of 

Education claimed it was up to each 
individual district how the new 
standards are met.

19th Century music 
to be digitized by 
University

Over the next two years, the 

University will digitize a large 
collection of sheet music collected 
by the Edison Phonograph Co. 
during the early 20th Century.

After amassing the music 

collection to record for the 
American public, the company 
closed in 1929 and the sheet music 
changed hands several times.

After making its way to the 

Henry Ford family and several 
other parties, the Univeristy of 
Michigan Library acquired the 
collection in 1989.

The University plans to digitize 

just over 30,000 of the collection’s 
titles — only a third — over the 
course of the next two years.

The Council on Library and 

Information Resources made 
the project possible with a grant 
through their Digitizing Hidden 
Special Collections and Archives 
program.

The project will yield the largest 

online collection of pre-1870 sheet 
music, and will allow people to 
explore music that was composed 
during an era of distinctly 
American music.

The digital collection will be 

accessible through the University’s 
library catalogue, Mirlyn, in 
addition to Google Books and the 
Digital Public Library of America.

tigating the R&E requirement 
and making recommendations 
— consists of nine faculty mem-
bers, four staff members, two 
undergraduate 
students, 
one 

graduate student and one post-
doctoral researcher. The goal is 
to understand students’ experi-
ences and assess their learning 
within R&E courses, according 
to Dillard.

Dillard said the taskforce is 

conducting 
quantitative 
and 

qualitative research to inform 
recommendations. 
She 
cited 

focus groups, surveys, evaluation 
and administrative data, histori-
cal research and discourse anal-
ysis as examples of the research 
involved in such a process.

“We can’t make any recom-

mendations about what to add 
until we have more data and 
evidence, and that’ll help to 
shape some of the things that 
we think we know,” Dillard said. 
“And sometimes what you think 
you know is just not born out in 
the data itself and you have to 
change your assumptions.”

This year, LSA also imple-

mented several other methods 

to collect feedback and evaluate 
students’ 
experiences 
within 

R&E classes. On Jan. 11, students 
who fulfilled their R&E require-
ment in the fall received an 
e-mail from Dillard inviting 
them to participate in an online 
Canvas-based discussion of the 
race & ethnicity degree require-
ment.

As well, about 70 students 

attended two forums this fall 
to provide feedback on the R&E 
requirement. Pitt noted that 
most attendees spoke in favor of 
maintaining and strengthening 
the requirement. Their feedback 
largely fell into three main cat-
egories: course content, course 
structure and course support.

In terms of reforming course 

content, Pitt said many stu-
dents at the forums expressed 
a desire for greater relevancy in 
their R&E classes. They favored 
content and courses focusing 
on issues of race and ethnicity 
applicable to society today.

“Our country and our campus 

is facing major issues with race 
and ethnicity, and it’s impor-
tant that we’re able to take what 
we’re learning in a class dedicat-
ed to R&E and apply it to be able 
to interact in the society we’re 
living in today,” Pitt said.

The forums also brought to 

light issues of course structure, 
particularly course size. Pitt said 
participants preferred smaller 
courses to large lectures, but 
they were open to lectures if 
discussion sections adequately 
facilitated honest dialogue and 
nurtured a comfortable environ-
ment.

However, students also point-

ed out that GSIs may not always 
be properly able to lead such sen-
sitive dialogues. Some suggested 
inviting a professional from 
Intergroup Relations to facilitate 
the initial discussion section if 
GSIs are not trained or prepared 
to do so.

“It’s important that if we are 

transitioning to a discussion-
based format, then they need to 
be able to make sure that stu-
dents are feeling comfortable 
and willing to speak on behalf of 
their experiences,” Pitt said.

Pitt also stressed a need 

for 
greater 
outside 
support 

for students, faculty and GSIs 
involved in R&E courses, pro-
posing a concept similar to the 
Sweetland Writing Center.

ernor and the third Democratic 
presidential hopeful, was also in 
the state Saturday and is polling 
at 5.8 percent in Iowa.

Throughout the event, Clin-

ton emphasized the pragmatism 
of her policy platform, saying 
her approach to everything from 
regulating the financial sector to 
creating green jobs was simply 
better. Better than who? For a 
while, Clinton didn’t say. When 
she did hit Sanders by name, 
the former secretary told the 
audience he would rip up the 
Affordable Care Act in favor of 
a single-payer program, whereas 
she would build on the existing 
policy.

“Getting from zero to 100 is a 

lot harder than getting from 90 
to 100,” she said, referencing the 
failed fight for universal health 
care she spearheaded as first 
lady in 1993.

Clinton, who is relying on the 

image of a candidate cloaked in 
experience, particularly in for-
eign policy, also played up her 
diplomatic and national security 
prowess.

“Remember, when you go to 

caucus on February first, you 
are choosing a president and a 
commander in chief,” she said. 
“When the new president walks 
into that White House on Janu-
ary 20, 2017, there are some 
things we know we’ve got to do, 
but there are a lot of things we 
can’t predict are going to be fac-
ing our country.”

Like Clinton, Bernie Sanders 

spent Saturday making distinc-
tions. In the dreary basement 
of the Masonic Center, Sand-
ers touted his poll numbers and 
made a case not only for the via-
bility of his candidacy, but also 
for the viability of his policy pro-
posals — proposals many critics 
have deemed overly idealistic or 
impractical.

“You can tell when a cam-

paign gets nervous — like the 

Clinton campaign — I think 
they’re getting a little nervous. 
What do you think?” Sanders 
asked the 700-person crowd that 
filled the hall’s sweaty basement.

The crowd peppered the 

senator’s remarks with shouts 
of “That’s right, Bernie!” and 
lengthy outbursts of “Feel the 
Bern” chants.

“Obviously I need your help in 

the next few days, to help us win 
here in Iowa. I need your help to 
win the Democratic nomination, 
but here’s the truth, I’m going to 
need your help the day after we 
get into the White House,” he 
said. “And the reason for that, 
everybody in this room knows 
who has studied history, change 
never comes about from the top 
on down. It only comes about 
from the bottom on up.”

Sanders, like his campaign, 

drew from the energy of his sup-
porters, engaging directly with 
the assembled crowd. The point 
he stressed: The Bernie Sanders 
campaign is really a movement 
of people calling for change. 
Before launching into the Sand-
ers stump speech which has by 
now become notorious for his 
use of terms like “oligarchy” and 
“bottom 99 percent” spoken in a 
distinctly Brooklyn accent, the 
candidate drew on the history 
of social movements — like the 
struggle for LGBTQ and civil 
rights — that were once deemed 
impossible.

“Let me give you one more 

example, which you guys made 
happen,” he said. “Eight years 
ago, all over this country, peo-
ple said, ‘An African American, 
becoming president of the Unit-
ed States, you’re nuts, that can’t 
happen?’ You made it happen, 
you made history. So my point 
is — that what history is about 
— it’s not a few people on top, 
coming up with clever ideas, it is 
when millions of people begin to 
stand up and say that the status 
quo is not good enough.”

inated. After the first round, 
the audience — the students 
of Entrepreneurship 407 — 
voted to determine which team 
would advance.

The competition is a valu-

able learning experience for 
both the competitors and the 
students of in the class, Rich-
ard Smith, a Ross School of 
Business alum, who has been 
attending the class for five 
years, said. He said the men-
tors help students to not only 
improve their businesses, but 
also improve the way they pres-
ent their ideas amid a heated 
competition. Mentors are indi-
viduals associated with the 
Center for Entrepreneurship, 
who work with each team to 
improve their ideas.

“The first round, the stu-

dents are rough,” he said. “But 
by the end of the semester they 
were smooth and polished and 
have content and have done 
work on developing the busi-
ness plan, the marketplace or 
the product itself. They are 
always magnitudes better at 
the end.”

Additionally, Levy said men-

tors played a critical role in the 
development of the team’s ideas 
and businesses.

“In any venture you do in 

life you need people with more 
experience to help guide you,” 
he said. “And the mentors are a 
great tool for the people trying 
to make their companies really 
profitable.”

Maite 
Iribarren, 
Art 
& 

Design and Engineering fresh-
man and a participant in the 
competition, said while she has 
a jewelry collection created 
and ready to be put into pro-
duction, she was “here to learn 
something about the business 
side of it.”

Matt Gibson, director of 

undergraduate programs at the 
Center for Entrepreneurship 
and co-founder of The Startup, 
said the judges become very 
invested in the participants 
they are guiding — they defend 
their teams and encourage the 
audience to vote for them to 
advance.

“The judges become your 

biggest supporters and fans,” 
he said.

Thomas Frank, executive 

director for the Center for 
Entrepreneurship and co-cre-
ator of the competition, said 
students benefit from hearing 
the different pitches and ideas.

“This gives students in this 

class an opportunity to go on 
a entrepreneurial journey with 
a bunch of different startups,” 
he said. “They get this real 
sort of first-hand chance to see 
how people succeed, how they 

struggle, how they make prog-
ress, how they don’t, and it is 
not the kind of experience you 
can get any other way.”

Engineering 
sophomore 

Nick Morris, an instructional 
assistant for the class, agreed 
that the competition is a great 
learning experience as they are 
able to analyze and critique the 
different pitches. He said he 
was excited to learn about the 
various companies and differ-
ent ideas.

LSA freshman Rachel Ordan, 

a student in the class, said she 
was excited to learn about the 
creative ideas of her peers.

“I’m excited to see the differ-

ent ways that groups are inno-
vative in finding new solutions 
to things that I can relate to,” 
she said.

The competition had a wide 

variety of startups. Iribarren, 
the jewelry designer, show-
cased products that she said 
take a different approach to 
how people wear jewelry.

“It’s for more than just 

accessorizing,” she said, “It’s 
kind of like something you have 
with you always, like a toy or a 
mechanism that can entertain 
you.”

Engineering senior Tristan 

MacKethan presented a web-
site called MSell that he said 
is a platform for people who 
want to buy and sell items in a 
market where items are sold in 
high volume around a particu-
lar time period — like football 
tickets in the fall or textbooks 
in the beginning or end of the 
semester.

LSA freshman Kyle Zaoitell, 

another competitor, created a 
website called Wage Pit which 
allows League of Legends play-
ers from around the world 
to make wagers against each 
other when they are playing 
the game.

The Startup finalists in years 

past have been very success-
ful now after the competition, 
Frank said.

“The team that won (last 

year) went from having an 
idea for how to help ALS 
(amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) 
patients communicate through 
puffs of air to bringing all of 
these medical factors out of 
their advisory board filing a 
provisional patent,“ Frank said.

During the first round on 

Friday, Gibson said the judges 
were looking for ambitious and 
confident teams that they think 
will be able to go the distance.

“They want something that 

can be a viable business,” he 
said “But maybe even more 
than that they are looking for 
students that are really ambi-
tious and looking to make 
something happen. They want 
to see that commitment and 
willingness to take it to the 
next level.”

in one of the art programs.

 FOKUS started as a way 

to bring together individuals 
of multiple backgrounds and 
interests under one organiza-
tion. Much of his decision to 
start the program, Edwards 
said. stemmed from his Brook-
lyn roots.

“Along the way, the whole 

idea was figuring out how to 
connect with communities,” 
he said. “Growing up where 
I come from, in Brooklyn, my 
sense of community was very 
different than the sense of 
community in the circles I’ve 
passed through.”

He added that his involve-

ment in FOKUS inspired him 
to continue a career in com-
munity involvement and edu-
cation in Brooklyn, where he 
is currently the director of 
operations for Brooklyn East 
Collegiate.

“My time here has got me 

into a lot of things I’ve con-
tinued on into to this day,” he 
said. “The biggest thing I want 
to do is make connections and 
allow people to realize that 
those connections are real and 
possible. Building relation-
ships within communities is 
highly important to me and 
one of the important things 
is the idea of, not necessarily 
creating a homogenous com-
munity, but looking at it more 
so as an assembly of indi-
viduals — we are all different 
humans in the room for a com-
mon purpose.”

Martinez attended the Uni-

versity as a transfer student 
and lived off-campus her first 
year — an experience she said 
was very isolating from much 
of the student activity on cam-
pus.

I

f you were anywhere near the 
Michigan League over Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day weekend, 

you likely noticed 
hordes of high 
school 
students 

running around 
in suits. What 
was going on? 
Had the career 
fair come early? 
Was the Univer-
sity 
of 
Michi-

gan 
promising 

admission to the 
best-dressed 
minors?

Not quite. That weekend, more 

than 600 high school students trav-
eled to Ann Arbor to participate in 
a Model United Nations conference 
called MUNUM. For four days, they 
assumed the roles of diplomats and 
world leaders from different coun-
tries, and debated and attempted 
to resolve some of the world’s most 
pressing issues.

The day after the conference 

ended, dozens of rightfully angry 
people gathered in Ann Arbor to 
demand justice for Flint. In the eyes 
of the protesters, justice seemed to 
imply that Michigan Gov. Rick Sny-
der (R) be recalled due to his com-
plicity in the Flint water disaster. 
Other calls for justice have included 
reparations for the damage to the 
property and people affected by the 
lead-tainted water.

But money and personal conse-

quences for the officials deemed 
responsible are necessary — but 
insufficient — components of justice 
for the nearly 100,000 people who 
were poisoned by their government. 
Justice is a dubious concept when so 
many people have been subjected to 
immeasurable long-term harm.

The closest thing to justice that 

our state can deliver to the city of 
Flint, aside from monetary compen-
sation — aid in dealing with long-
term consequences of lead poisoning 
and punishment for the complicit 
officials — certainly includes policy 
reforms to prevent a similar situation 
from happening in the future. That’s 
where our government officials 
would be best served by taking a les-
son from the idealistic high schoolers 
who flooded Michigan’s campus for 
the MUNUM conference.

At MUNUM, I directed a com-

mittee of about 80 high school 
students, and challenged them to 
reform a global trade agreement 
that requires almost every country 
in the world to adopt and enforce 
copyright, trademark and patent 
protection laws. If that issue sounds 
a bit dense, that’s only because it is. 
International trade law isn’t exactly 
a topic of casual conversations — 
especially among high schoolers.

But there is an important reason to 

discuss this issue — the law in ques-
tion often restricts low-income coun-
tries’ abilities to provide affordable 
life-saving drugs to their citizens 

during health crises. Powerful, devel-
oped countries claim the agreement 
is necessary for economic reasons. 
Low-income countries often counter 
that it prioritizes company profits at 
the expense of human health.

The students in my committee 

debated this issue as if it affected 
them personally. They came to a 
resolution far more comprehen-
sive than anything I’ve seen sug-
gested elsewhere, least of all by 
the U.S. government.

The reason they were so effec-

tive in representing the interests of 
other people affected by an issue they 
probably hadn’t thought about before 
seemed to be their ability to empa-
thize. Empathy is a skill Model UN 
tries to cultivate, prompting students 
to totally assume the mindset of dip-
lomats with a national identities dif-
ferent from their own.

If there’s any single thing I could 

point to as a cause of the Flint water 
crisis, it’s the complete failure of 
Michigan leaders to empathize with 
the people they were appointed to 
serve. But this lack of empathy doesn’t 
necessarily stem from a personal fail-
ure on the part of our leaders (though 
that certainly may have played a role).

Rather, this total failure to 

understand and advocate for the 
interests of Flint residents is sys-
temic, and therefore susceptible to 
repetition. It’s called Public Act 4, 
a 2012 law that strengthened the 
power of emergency managers. In 
2012, Gov. Snyder remarked that 
“these new laws recognize the vital 
importance of financially stable, 
economically vibrant communities 
to Michigan’s future.”

But by enhancing the authority of 

leaders far removed from the people 
they serve, it lowered the likelihood 
that these leaders would adequately 
value the interests of the people they 
were appointed to represent.

Failure to empathize may sound 

like a pretty squishy explanation for 
what has surely become one of the 
most costly and highest-profile gov-
ernment-made catastrophes of the 
Snyder administration. But the entire 
concept of American democracy is 
derived from the idea that the most 
effective and just leaders are those 
most able to understand, relate to and 
advocate for the people they serve.

Emergency managers almost by 

definition don’t fit these criteria. 
They are supposed to override local 
interests with the goal of taking 
tough but necessary austerity mea-
sures that elected officials are some-
times too fearful to impose. This 
is deemed necessary, and may be 
appropriate for addressing budgetary 
concerns in a strictly financial sense. 
Public Act 4 gave emergency manag-
ers power over most noteworthy city 
operations, and even the authority to 
renegotiate contracts.

In Flint, the state had far more 

power than should’ve been neces-
sary to restore fiscal solvency. This 
power is, in the most direct and fun-

damental sense, what caused the 
Flint water crisis.

It’s hard to imagine local leaders 

who wouldn’t react promptly to yel-
low water flowing out of sinks, show-
ers and fire hydrants throughout their 
city. It’s even less likely that local gov-
ernment would have failed to respond 
immediately to concerns over lead poi-
soning, the effects of which will con-
tinue to impact their city for decades, 
long after state officials have turned 
their attention to other issues.

But for nearly two years, more than 

8,600 children in Flint have been 
exposed to water with elevated lead 
levels, irrevocably raising their risk 
of learning, behavioral and attention 
disorders. Despite knowing about the 
issue for months, the state failed to 
acknowledge or resolve the problem.

They continued to deny the lead 

concerns until 38-year-old Flint 
pediatrician Dr. Mona Hanna-Atti-
sha studied data on the blood lead 
levels of child Medicaid beneficia-
ries in Flint, and repeatedly alerted 
state officials that the numbers 
were extremely high.

The Flint water crisis has since 

become a national controversy. Every-
one from Cher to Ben Carson has 
weighed in. President Barack Obama 
has declared a state of emergency. Sny-
der himself has even admitted that he 
and his administration had failed the 
people of Flint.

The state has promised money 

and profusely apologized for their 
mismanagement of the water cri-
sis, but state leaders have yet to 
produce adequate solutions to 
the problems they created. The 
city still lacks adequate plans and 
funding to compensate victims 
and create special education and 
juvenile corrections programs for 
the more than 8,600 children now 
statistically more likely to need 
these facilities.

I’ve seen no evidence that those 

plans are in the works. Soon, the 
24-hour news cycle will find some-
thing new to talk about. Cher, Bernie 
Sanders, Ben Carson, Michael Moore 
and the other celebrities who have 
thrust Flint into the national spotlight 
will focus their attention elsewhere.

But the people of Flint will be liv-

ing with the impacts of this govern-
ment failure long after the bottled 
water donations and news trucks have 
stopped showing up in their town. 
The state officials, reporters and out-
of-town advocates can all move on as 
soon as it’s convenient for them to do 
so. Those affected by the poisoned 
water don’t have that luxury.

No amount of restitution or ret-

ribution can change that basic fact. 
Justice for Flint requires that the 
state honor the legacy of the city and 
people it so monumentally failed by 
preventing a repeat incident else-
where. To do that, our legislators 
must reform Public Act 4.

“H

istory is written by the vic-
tors” was perhaps Winston 
Churchill’s most well-known 

quote. Like many great 
quotes, 
it’s 
one 
that 

expresses a grand idea 
succinctly and elegantly: 
Those who win write not 
only their own history but 
also everyone else’s. While some apply this 
only to war, it extends to any type of conflict. 
When any two groups engage in competition, 
there are, by default, always winners and los-
ers. From sports, to grades, to social situations, 
someone always has an edge.

These competitions are often construed as 

being completely fair, as all participants engage 
in the same task, meaning one shouldn’t, hypo-
thetically, confront any more difficulty than 
another during the task. However, this doesn’t 
take into account that people are shaped by 
their previous experiences, which are different 
for each person. These experiences are often 
dependent on social identity, with privilege 
and social capital playing a large part in life. 
The challenges I have faced as a white male of 
high socioeconomic status are profoundly dif-
ferent (and overall, lesser) than those faced by 
any person of color.

In certain aspects of society throughout his-

tory, privilege has resulted in overrepresenta-
tion of certain groups over others, one of the 
most privileged groups being males in leader-
ship positions. We can see this effect across a 
number of professions: in education, business, 
the military and often government as well. 
This overrepresentation in the present leads to 
overrepresentation in history, and contributes 
to the prevalence of buildings and monuments 
dedicated to men.

While you can see this all over, on gov-

ernment buildings or sports stadiums, it is 
especially apparent in institutions of higher 
learning. Regarded as a bastion of liberalism, 
you might think the University of Michigan 
wouldn’t hold true to this common practice. 
And to a degree, it doesn’t, with four residence 
halls named after women (Martha Cook, Alice 
Lloyd, Mary Markley, Helen Newberry, Betsy 
Barbour) and one academic building named 
after a heterosexual couple (Betsy and Bob 
Beyster Building). However, there is current-
ly no academic building named solely after 
a woman. And given that the University has 
more than 500 buildings spread over North, 
South, Medical and Central campuses, the 
buildings listed above constitute a paltry sum.

Many feminists know too well the ways 

in which women have been erased from his-
tory, and in response, they have created the 
aptly named “her-story,” in opposition to “his-
story.” However, you can’t really construct 

buildings for the express purpose of naming 
them after women, which would be the physi-
cal equivalent of writing her-story. While you 
could rename current monuments and build-
ings, this is met with fierce resistance.

That being said, three members of LSA Stu-

dent Government — budget allocations com-
mittee chair Nicholas Fadanelli, President 
Jason Colella and Vice President Reid Kloot-
wyk — may have found an opportunity to rem-
edy this problem. With construction underway 
for the new Biological Sciences Building, and 
no name currently assigned to it other than 
“Biological Sciences Building,” there is an 
opportunity to have an academic building at 
the University named after a woman. Colella, 
Klootwyk and Fadanelli sought to bring about 
this change by writing a resolution and trying 
to pass it through student government. What’s 
more, they have a perfect candidate to name 
the building after: our former University Presi-
dent Emerita Mary Sue Coleman, one of only 
two former University presidents who do not 
have a building named after them.

Mary Sue Coleman has been one of our 

most respected and distinguished former 
presidents. She earned many awards while in 
office, including being named one of the top 
10 college presidents in the country by TIME. 
And even after leaving her job as president 
of the University, Coleman has continued to 
give the school a good name. Since her depar-
ture, she has served as the president of the 
Association of American Universities and 
was appointed by President Barack Obama to 
help launch one of his initiatives. And these 
are just a few of the accomplishments she has 
achieved so far.

As Fadanelli stated in an e-mail exchange 

with the Daily, “The fact that the University of 
Michigan does not have an academic building 
named solely after a woman is not only shock-
ing, but it is also shameful. We, here, strive to 
push for diversity and inclusion in every field 
of study, and the lack of an academic building 
named after a woman does not send the image 
or the message that I believe the University of 
Michigan should.”

LSA Student Government will be voting at 

their Jan. 27 meeting on this resolution that 
would put pressure on the University to name 
the building after Coleman. Following LSA 
Student Government’s consideration of the 
resolution, they will urge Central Student Gov-
ernment to do the same.

I believe naming a building after a distin-

guished woman such as Mary Sue Coleman 
will start the University on the right track, and 
maybe even rewrite a little history itself.

When news of the Flint water 

crisis broke national headlines, I 
couldn’t believe the reports I was 
reading. The citizens of Flint had 
been drinking river water con-
taminated not only by lead, but 
also with E. coli and trihalometh-
anes, for more than an entire year. 
Worse yet, they essentially were 
poisoned in order to save the city 
money. Every article brought new 
testimonies — new tragedies — 
from victims of the crisis.

This isn’t something that fami-

lies in Flint can simply recover from. 
There is no bouncing back: Lead poi-
soning, at any threshold, will cause 
irreversible damage to the body. 
Children from Flint are the biggest 
victims, given that lead exposure 
results in effects reduced IQ, anti-
social behavior or immunotoxicity, 
to name a few. The most haunting 
images from this catastrophe are 
those featuring “elected” officials 
proudly toasting with cups of tap 
water to celebrate the switch from 
the Detroit water system to the Flint 
River. It’s so haunting because it is 
the same people captured in those 
photos who would turn a blind eye 
the next week to an unending stream 
of public complaints, jugs of putrid 
brown water brought to city council 
meetings and widespread outbreaks 
of skin lesions/hair falling out.

Returning to Ann Arbor after 

Winter Break, I hesitated briefly 
at the thought of drinking a cup of 
water from the faucet. I kept ask-
ing myself whether or not I could 
trust the tap water after reading 
about the tragedy unfolding just 
a one-hour drive away — a ridicu-

lous thought in hindsight. Review-
ing the depravity and failure of the 
Flint city government and Michi-
gan state government didn’t give 
me any sense of reassurance. It only 
made me more skeptical and cyni-
cal about whom to trust. Never-
theless, I’m very certain my water 
isn’t contaminated (to the extent 
of Flint’s), but the question still lin-
gers in my mind: What if the water 
here is poisoned, and I just continue 
to drink?

The University of Michigan is Gov. 

Snyder’s alma mater; he received 
not only his bachelor’s degree, not 
only his master’s degree in business 
administration, but also his juris doc-
tor degree here nearly 33 years ago. It 
is disturbing — no, humiliating — to 
know that the man at the epicenter of 
the Flint water crisis walked through 
the Diag, sat in one of the Angell Hall 
auditoriums or took a stroll through 
the Law Quad.

Why do I mention his attendance 

at the University of Michigan? Well, 
to be frank, it boggles my mind that 
someone like him could come from 
this school — my school. The evi-
dence for Gov. Snyder as an active 
villain of the crisis couldn’t be any 
more clear or well documented: 
Unconscionable 
shortcuts 
were 

taken, warnings were ignored or 
even refuted, and action was, and 
still has been, limited. Believe it or 
not, part of the University’s mission 
statement is “to serve the people of 
Michigan … and in developing lead-
ers and citizens who will challenge 
the present and enrich the future.” 
Though he is not completely to 
blame, Gov. Snyder, as an alum, has 

failed the mission of the University 
of Michigan, given what has unfold-
ed in Flint. The community of Flint 
has been devastated from his admin-
istration’s inaction and negligence. 
There is simply no excuse for what 
has happened.

As a current undergraduate stu-

dent here at Michigan, I can’t help 
but wonder how Gov. Snyder came 
to be able to make the unfortunate 
decisions he makes today. Was it 
during his first four years at Michi-
gan that he began valuing money 
over the lives of children, was it 
when he began to work at Irvine 
or was it when he returned to Ann 
Arbor to create Ardesta LLC?

The 
University 
of 
Michigan 

shouldn’t be attributed to the mis-
takes of our governor. However, if 
men like Gov. Snyder can come from 
schools like the University, perhaps 
our degrees should begin requiring 
all students to take a course in eth-
ics and morals. This might make it 
more difficult later on to devalue 
human life. While I recognize it 
is idealistic to say starting salary 
shouldn’t matter, our institution 
needs to reaffirm that our degrees 
mean we are not only educated, but 
also committed to the public good. 
If the world of money after college 
will try to corrupt us, our education 
should serve as a deterrence. Some-
where along the way, Gov. Snyder 
forgot about what it means to be an 
alum of the University of Michigan. 
Somewhere along the way, he began 
to drink poisoned water.

Zwilich concerto 
evokes emotions

USO to perform 

classical program at 

Hill Auditorium

By DAYTON HARE

Daily Arts Writer

Classical music has long been 

justifiably accused of being the 
genre of dead white men. It 
comes out of 
a 
European 

tradition, and 
like almost all 
professional 
fields, it has 
historically 
been 
domi-

nated by men. 
But over the 
past 50 years 
or so, classi-
cal music has 
been 
diversi-

fying, mirror-
ing the overall 
transforma-
tion of society. This certainly 
isn’t happening quickly or eas-
ily — the classical music world 
is notorious for its intransigent 
and traditional nature — but 
more and more women and 
minorities have started landing 
jobs in major orchestras and 
taking the stage as featured 
soloists.

One area of classical music in 

particular that has been slow to 
evolve is the field of composi-
tion. With a few notable excep-
tions — Barbara Strozzi, Fanny 
Mendelssohn, Clara Schumann, 
Ethel Smyth, Nadia Boulanger 
— there have been nearly no 
famed female composers until 
very recently. Today, numerous 
female composers of great tal-
ent and skill are active — such 
as Joan Tower, Shulamit Ran, 
Augusta Read Thomas, Kaija 
Saariaho, Julia Wolfe and many 
others — but there is still a 
noticeable disparity between 
the number of male and female 
artists in the public eye.

Another 
such 
success-

ful woman composer is Ellen 
Taaffe Zwilich, who — along 
with Joan Tower — is one of the 
earliest contemporary female 
composers to establish a large 
reputation. Still active today, 
Zwilich will have her latest 
work, Concerto Elegia — for 
flute and string orchestra — 
performed on Wednesday by 
flutist Amy Porter and the Uni-
versity Symphony Orchestra 
under the direction of Kenneth 
Kiesler. Also on the program 
will be Verdi, Wagner and 
Ravel.

“I’ve been a musician since 

I was — I don’t know — old 
enough to climb under the 
piano bench,” Zwilich said in 
a phone interview with The 
Michigan Daily. “I had the very 
good fortune to go to a high 
school that had a wonderful 
music program … I was a trum-
pet player and a violinist, and 
wrote music for the band to 
play ... it was quite a wonderful 
high school music experience I 
had, and I lament the fact that 
that’s not available to all kids 
today.”

Zwilich began her collegiate 

musical studies at Florida State 
University — where she is now 
a professor — and following 

her graduation, moved to New 
York.

“One of my big reasons [for 

moving to New York] was to get 
better as a violinist … shortly 
after I got [to New York] I began 
to work as a violinist,” Zwilich 
said. “I had seven years in the 
American Symphony Orchestra 
under Leopold Stokowski — 
which was quite interesting — 
and at one point I really wanted 
to go further with my composi-
tion … I had never quite written 
a piece I was satisfied with.”

Zwilich then began pursu-

ing a degree in composition at 
the Juilliard School, studying 
with the renowned compos-
ers Elliott Carter and Roger 
Sessions. In 1975 she became 
the first woman to ever earn 
a doctorate in composition 
from Juilliard, an event which 
marked the beginning of her 
many triumphs as a composer.

“Eight years later I had an 

overnight 
success,” 
Zwilich 

said, alluding to her winning of 
the Pulitzer Prize for her Sym-
phony No. 1. She was the first 
woman to win the prestigious 
prize, and her ensuing popular-
ity allowed her to compose full-
time, secure in the assumption 
that commissions would be 
regular enough.

“I’ve been lucky.” Zwilich 

said. “Writing has been part of 
my life really since I was ten 
years old. I love what I do, and 
it’s a great honor to write for 
some of the people I’ve written 
for.”

Concerto Elegia, the piece 

which 
will 
be 
performed 

Wednesday by the USO, was 
commissioned by a group of 
eleven universities, including 
the University of Michigan. 
It was completed last year, in 
response to a personal tragedy 
which also caused a dry spell 
for Zwilich preceding its com-
position.

“I had a commission for flute 

and string orchestra … and my 
husband [Erik Lamont] died,” 
Zwilich said. “And I was real-
ly not able to write much for 
a time after that, and it really 
just turned into a memorial for 
him.”

The piece is in three move-

ments, the first Elegy the sec-
ond Soliloquy and the last 
Epilogue, to which Zwilich 
affixed an inscription of impor-
tance to her.

“I’ve put in the score a quote 

from [the ancient Greek play-
wright] Sophocles, saying ‘One 
must wait until evening to see 
how splendid the day has been,’ 
” Zwilich said. “ The odd thing 
about it was that this is the next 
piece I was supposed to write, 
and when I wrote the Elegy — 
which was very different from 
all the thoughts I had about the 
piece — I found out after I’d fin-
ished it that in ancient Greece 
the flute was the instrument of 
elegy. It was really quite amaz-
ing.”

Concerto Elegia is a concer-

to, which means that it is for a 
soloist and orchestra. Tradi-
tionally the orchestra has been 
regarded as accompaniment 
to the soloist, but many more-
recent composers — including 
Zwilich — have come to regard 
the form as a dialogue.

“I really love to balance 

the weight of the solo instru-
ment against the weight of the 
orchestra,” Zwilich said. “For 
me a concerto doesn’t mean that 
the orchestra is lying down like 
a doormat. It involves interac-
tion — almost everything that 
moves me in music and what 
I want to write is really a lot 
like chamber music. Where 
there is support and interaction 
between the ensemble and the 
soloist.”

The piece also gives ample 

opportunity for the soloist to 
display their skill, artistry and 
individuality.

“There’s a little room for 

the performer to put their own 
stamp on it,” Zwilich said. 
“And I like that, because for me 
music doesn’t exist until some-
one breathes life into it.”

“It’s a piece left open for 

many chances of interpreta-
tion,” said flute soloist Amy 
Porter, a professor at the School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance. 
“I also feel like because it’s in 
memory of her late husband, 
it’s putting life and death expe-
riences into my performance, 
because I’ve suffered loss as 
well.”

Porter described the piece as 

being extremely fluid, lyrical 
and emotionally engaging. For 
an open listener, the concerto is 
designed to touch strong emo-
tions. When asked if there was 
anything she would like audi-
ence members to know before 
hearing the piece, the compos-
er had some specific advice.

“One of the saddest things, 

in my experience, is when 
somebody comes up to me and 
asks ‘what should I listen for?’ 
” Zwilich said. “And my answer 
is always ‘open your ears and 
your heart and your mind, your 
soul — the whole thing — and 
just listen.”Zwilich said. “And 
my answer is always ‘open your 
ears and your heart and your 
mind, your soul — the whole 
thing — and just listen.”

Allure of journalism

HBO

You know what they say about small hands.

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Music & Blog Editor

I love journalism porn. I’m not 

talking about Playboy editorials, 
nor am I talking about the most 
sleekly 
designed, 
well-written 

publications available today.

Specifically, I’m referring to 

the second dictionary definition 
under “porn”: television programs, 
magazine, books, etc. that are 
regarded as emphasizing the sen-
suous or sensational aspects of a 
nonsexual subject and stimulating 
a compulsive interest in their audi-
ence.

In this scenario, the keywords/

phrases are “television, books, 
etc.” (film), “sensational aspects” 
and 
“compulsive 
interest 
in 

their audience.” The sensational 
aspects are the dedication, ideal-
ism and honesty of the upward-
looking depictions in my favorite 
Journalism porn go-tos: HBO’s 
“The Newsroom,” the 2015 film 
“Spotlight” and the 2007 FX 
series “Dirt” — more different 
than similar, all three pieces of 
media fluff up the cloudy ped-
estal on which I’ve placed The 
Fourth Estate.

“The Newsroom” is an often-

criticized portrayal of an elite 
newsroom basked in Sorkin-
esque idealism and crisply engi-
neered banter: often-criticized 
in that many media sources find 
the show’s tone preachy and ide-
alistic in the way that it offers an 
otherworldly example of journal-
ism. It pays no attention to balance 
for balance’s sake, gives facts and 
asks only knowledgeable guests to 

weigh in. But in today’s political 
culture where political television 
more often than not resembles ide-
ological MMA fighting rather than 
intellectual discourse, maybe 2016 
could use a little Atlantis Cable 
News. Or maybe I just watch “The 
Newsroom” too much. I don’t think 
that’s anyone’s call to make.

As “The Newsroom” is idealis-

tic, “Spotlight” is raw. “Spotlight,” 
one of this year’s least flashy 
“Best Picture” nominees, tells 
the story of a Boston investiga-
tive journalism team uncovering a 
widespread child sex abuse in the 
Boston archdiocese of the Catho-
lic Church. It shows the grueling 
work — the fact-checking, the 
busy work, the frustration and 
even the anger and shame that 
can accompany aspects of the 
job. “Spotlight” gracefully bal-
ances the heavy content with brief 
moments of humor that didn’t 
detract from the story being told, 
as well as highlighting the often-
forgotten origin of journalism: 
truth. Not because it’s easy or nec-
essarily what people want to hear, 
but because it’s right.

“Dirt” — if the name didn’t give 

it away — is lower brow than the 
aforementioned and puts more of 
its emphasis on the “porn.” The 
short-lived FX drama centers on 
ruthless gossip magazine editor-
in-chief Lucy Spiller (Courteney 
Cox, “Friends”). It’s the epitome 
of guilty pleasure. It’s lurid in its 
portrayal of both journalism and 
celebrity: the nittiest and the grit-
tiest aspects of both played out 
over a season and a half of out of 
control cover stories including a 

beheaded R&B star, fake pregnan-
cies, real pregnancies and (clearly) 
a “Sexxx Issue,” polybagged and 
loaded with celebs’ private mate-
rial.

While the dirtier aspects of 

“Dirt” do offer as much pleasure 
as they do guilt, Lucy Spiller 
offers a moral compass to a rather 
immoral show. Sure, she’s a tab-
loid queen (a business that the 
world would be much better off 
without), but her commitment to 
the truth and always getting “the 
scoop” is not only infection, but 
in some ways it’s reminiscent of 
“The Newsroom.” At D!rt Now, 
they are above publishing lies — 
instead they just do whatever it 
takes to get to the dirtiest truths. 
 

“The Newsroom,” “Spotlight” 

and “Dirt” exemplify the porni-
fication of the journalist. More-
over, these quickly paced, highly 
addicting dramas point to some-
thing bigger. Think of the average 
television drama ... each of them 
has a journalist or quasi-journal-
ist character. “Scandal” is filled 
to the brim, “House of Cards” has 
Zoe, “Orange Is The New Black” 
has Larry (bleh), “Parks and Rec” 
has talk show hosts and many 
more, to name a few.

Journalism is pervasive, rep-

resentationally, in today’s media, 
even if only through the use of 
minor characters. When the media 
elite do take the focus of a project, 
I can only liken that product to the 
most addicting of addictions. Jour-
nalism porn leaves me with what it 
admits to: sensationalism. But sen-
sational is something to aspire to, is 
it not?

T

here was once a point 
in my life when I 
called Bob Dylan a 

prophet, like a literal prophet, 
and thought I meant it.

I 

dropped 
out 
of 

organized 
religion 
around 
age 14, but 
even if the 
Catholic 
Church 
doesn’t 
neces-
sarily 
fit 

with what’s in your heart, that 
doesn’t mean all your spiri-
tual questions are immediately 
satisfied. At the same time, 
though, that doesn’t mean it’s 
easy to just up and join another 
religion. I think there’s a cer-
tain amount of belief you’re just 
born with, but if you lose that, 
then something really crazy has 
to happen for you to regain it. 
In other words, I couldn’t just 
choose something because it 
made sense; I had to feel it.

So I turned to music. The 

closest thing I could get to reli-
gious ecstacy or a connection 
with something greater was 
screaming the lyrics to “Like 
a Rolling Stone” while driving 
home, or pacing my basement at 
3 a.m. to Elliott Smith and The 
National, or sitting in my back-
yard listening to Astral Weeks. 
I got caught up with the art-
ists whose voices touched my 
soul, got obsessed and started 
to take my relationship with 
music 
incredibly 
seriously. 

I wanted to believe that just 
‘cause I cried when I first heard 
Jeff Buckley’s “Hallelujah” it 
meant he could save my soul, 
and that Dylan held the secrets 
of the universe in his tightly 
knotted verse and if I could just 
untangle them I’d know exactly 
how to live. I needed these guys 
with guitars to be my preach-
ers. Their albums were so spe-
cial to me that I wanted them 
to be scripture. I felt like their 
songs should be able to fix me 
whenever I felt broken.

And I still feel that impulse 

more than I wish I would. I 
have stomachaches that I try 
to medicate with acoustic gui-
tar, confrontations that make 
me long for David Bowie or 
existential problems I want 
to resolve with Van Morrison. 
I mix playlists like cocktails 
— one part Paul Simon, one 
part Paul McCartney, one part 
Townes Van Zant — and drink 
them hoping they’ll make me 
feel the way I want. Instead, 
they’ll usually just feed into 
the feelings I’m already hav-
ing. I’ll be on my couch listen-
ing to a song over and over and 
over again, and I won’t be able 
to stop, like I’m trapped and 
keep hitting the l<< button on 
my iPod but I can’t explain to 
myself why, and I’ll just be frus-
trated that the music isn’t help-
ing anything.

But other times it just clicks. 

And when it does, it’s with 
weird artists. Like, there’s a 
song by A Flock of Seagulls — of 
all the bands — called “Space 
Age Love Song” and it’s one 
of the most beautiful things 
I’ve ever heard not because it 
“speaks to me” or because it 
even knows I exist and am lis-
tening, but because it just is. 
I love it because the singer is 
hopeful and the guitar feels like 
it’s propelling me on a fantastic 
journey and sometimes that’s 
all I need more than anything.

And then out of nowhere I’ll 

get mesmerized by something 
like the intro to John Cougar 
Mellencamp’s “I Need a Lover,” 
just this piano sprinkled over 
hard drumming and heavy 
riffs. I start smiling because 
the cowbell that just came in 
feels like it’s being hit to the 
exact same pace as my heart. 
And then everything starts to 
quiet down for just a second 
after about two minutes, only 
to return with about 10 times 
as much force — the fireworks-
blasting, jump-up-and-hit-the-
ground-in-unison 
full-band 

moment that makes the whole 
track perfect. And then I real-
ize the main part of the song 
hasn’t even started yet.

Honestly, as anticlimactic 

as it might be, I think the dif-
ference is as simple as expec-
tations. I want Van Morrison 
to make me fly and give me a 
life where everything’s per-
fect, and of course he’s not 
gonna be able to manage a task 
like that. I just want A Flock 
of Seagulls and John Mellen-
camp to deliver something I 
can enjoy, and when they do, I 
don’t try to make the song into 
anything holy. Music is special, 
but it’s not magic, and digging 
for answers by listening to old 
albums is more often an exer-
cise in self-conscious nostalgia 
than an action that will get you 
anywhere new.

So I’ve been listening to Seu 

Jorge’s David Bowie covers, 
and honestly, as I’m writing 
this, I feel really good, because 
every time I finish a paragraph 
I’ve just been sitting back and 
taking deep breaths and just 
kind of laughing to myself, 
because there’s a very strong 
part of me that actually wishes 
I could solve life by throwing 
my entire being into all kinds 
of music — whether it’s with a 
record as huge as My Beauti-
ful Dark Twisted Fantasy or 
with the recordings of a dude 
with an acoustic guitar just try-
ing to wrap Portuguese sounds 
around 
“Queen 
Bitch” 
and 

“Five Years.”

I’m really just trying to clear 

my head and breathe and not 
try to think or feel or force any-
thing, to just let these songs 
flow through me and cleanse 
me without directing them to 
the problem areas of my brain 
and forcing music to fix them. 
And I love it, and I feel so much 
better now — not because the 
artists I love have mystical 
healing powers, but because I 
realize they don’t and can still 
love their work with all my 
heart anyway.

‘Anomalisa’ explores 
oddity and tragedy

PARAMOUNT PICTURES

Is this pre or post-puppet sex?

By MADELEINE GAUDIN

Daily Arts Writer

How good can a puppet movie 

with an R rating for sexual con-
tent and graphic nudity be?

Really, really 

good. 
Good 

enough to be 
the best animat-
ed (and possibly 
best all-around) 
movie 
of 
the 

year. 
Char-

lie 
Kaufman’s 

(“Synecdoche, 
New 
York”) 

latest follows apathetic self help 
author Michael Stone (David 
Thewlis “Macbeth”) through a 
daylong visit to Cincinnati, Ohio. 
But Kaufman cracks through 
this simple plot to ask (and not 
answer) some of the world’s most 
impossible and important ques-
tions. Unlike previous Kaufman 
films, “Anomalisa” isn’t a maze or 
a puzzle. Its plot can be summa-
rized on a line rather than a page. 
By keeping his narrative taut, 
Kaufman allows himself to create 
a world full of stunning visuals 
(remember, everything is puppet 
sized!) and complex characters.

“Anomalisa” didn’t need to be 

a puppet movie, but it succeeds 

because it is one. The oddities 
and tragedies of human behavior 
are magnified when acted out by 
3D-printed puppets. There is no 
conflation of actor and character 
because there isn’t any acting. So 
in a way, “Anomalisa” becomes 
more human. But, it doesn’t want 
its audience to confuse the pup-
pets for humans, leaving seams 
across the cheeks and hairlines. 
Part of Michael’s face even falls 
off at one point, revealing its 
mechanical interior.

After a failed reunion with an 

old flame, Michael meets Lisa, 
brought to life by the glowing 
voice of Jennifer Jason Leigh 
(“The Hateful Eight”). Lisa is 
the anomaly after which the film 
is named. And she is the only 
character besides Michael not 
voiced by Tom Noonan (“Man-
hunter”), so when she appears on 
the screen, giggling nervously in a 
hotel bathrobe, the audience sees 
and hears her as Michael does — 
a refreshing burst of novelty and 
originality.

The pair end up in Michael’s 

room 
and 
before 
the 
infa-

mous puppet sex scene, Lisa, at 
Michael’s request, sings “Girls 
Just Wanna Have Fun.” It’s one 
of the most beautiful moments in 
the entire film. It’s one of the most 

beautiful moments in any film. I 
never thought a puppet singing 
Cyndi Lauper would make me 
cry, but the scene is “Anomalisa” 
at its rawest — it’s the simplicity 
of having a favorite song and the 
odd honesty of singing it to some-
one you barely know.

Then there’s puppet sex. And 

it’s uncomfortable. But it’s also 
honest. Michael and Lisa fum-
ble awkwardly with each other, 
each action made deliberate by 
their insecurities and the worry 
that this could be their last (and 
maybe even only) chance to 
“get it right.” The scene — like 
the whole film — is heavy, but 
not so heavy that it isn’t funny. 
Kaufman manages to find humor 
within the tragedy of banal-
ity and urgency of middle age. 
“Anomalisa” is heartbreaking, 
but to have your heart broken by 
a movie like this is its own kind 
of pleasure.

During the film’s climatic 

scene Michael asks a room full 
of puppets, “What is it to be 
human?” Yes, there’s some irony 
there, but there’s also a whole lot 
of honesty. Because, ultimately, 
“Anomalisa” is the best thing any 
piece of art can strive to be: hon-
est.

Paul Dano, where is that wig from?

Tolstoy’s classic novel 
retold by the BBC

By DANIELLE YACOBSON

Daily Arts Writer

Bring on the vodka and fur 

coats: BBC is taking us to Rus-
sia circa 1805, and we will never 
want to come 
back. The net-
work takes on 
an 
ambitious 

project 
when 

producing 
a 

four-part mini-
series 
based 

on 
Leo 
Tol-

stoy’s 
“War 

and Peace,” one 
of the world’s 
most renowned 
literary 
epics 

that 
would 

inevitably spur 
rampant criticism with any cin-
ematic interpretation. But, as 
the low basses of Russian sing-
ers echo through the astonishing 
landscape of the opening scene, 
it’s clear that the undertaking 
is well worth the risk. Backed 
by an award-winning cast and a 
grandiose budget to match the 
large-scale production, “War and 
Peace” is unlike anything else on 
television: powerful and thrill-
ing, the miniseries is an artistic 
masterpiece.

Tolstoy’s “War and Peace” has 

stood the test of literary time by 
capturing the complex stories 
of the characters in a way that, 
however far removed from the 
modern day, is never truly for-
eign. The miniseries is able to 
bring the universal themes of 
love, power and glory to life in 
part due to the fantastic cast. 
Lily James (“Downton Abbey”) 

perfectly embodies the lively 
and outspoken Natasha Rostova, 
the daughter of a well-off aris-
tocratic family whose hopelessly 
romantic endeavors lead her to 
a messy love triangle. Beautiful 
and strikingly optimistic, James’s 
performance makes it impossible 
to look away. Meanwhile, Paul 
Dano (“Little Miss Sunshine”) 
captures the affections of the 
audience from his first, clumsy 
appearance on screen as Pierre 
Bezukhov, and James Norton 
(“Happy Valley”) shines as the 
brooding 
and 
philosophical 

Prince Andrei Bolkonsky.

Yet what truly sets “War and 

Peace” apart from other well-
regarded period dramas like 
“Downton Abbey” is the one-
of-a-kind cinematography. To 
stay true to the authenticity of 
the novel, the production was 
filmed in various Eastern Euro-
pean locations, including Russia, 
Latvia and Lithuania. As a result, 
the early 19th century blooms on 
screen. The viewers feel acutely 
present as the Russian forces 
battle against the Napoleonic 
armies, risking their own lives as 
the soldiers are bombarded with 
fire. Inside the lavish palaces of 
the aristocratic Russian fami-
lies, the sumptuousness oozes 
and spills over into a glamorous 
visual. Gold-plated ballrooms 

and exquisite costumes decorate 
the screen, and the real world 
slips away. Rarely is a TV series 
so aesthetically beautiful that it 
is able to capture the audience’s 
attention with such unbreak-
able strength that reality, for a 
moment, ceases to exist.

Embellishing the visual com-

ponent is a wonderful musi-
cal score developed by Martin 
Phipps (“Woman in Gold”), able 
to create passion and heartache 
in the smallest nuances of the 
series. The viewer is instantly 
placed in the story’s virtual 
reality as Russian folk melodies 
are perfectly synched with the 
pounding of war drums, and 
despair is mimicked with just 
a few precise notes. While Tol-
stoy’s saga was able to capture a 
culture through words, the BBC 
miniseries takes advantage of all 
the aesthetic capabilities of the 
screen arts.

Inevitably, developing a near-

ly 1,500 page novel into an eight-
hour series loses some of the 
great nuances that fill the origi-
nal masterpiece. Perhaps, some 
of the overarching themes that 
distinguish 
Tolstoy’s 
famous 

work from the rest are not as 
developed in the miniseries, 
an aspect that loyal fans to the 
literature will find disappoint-
ing. Yet the striking cinematog-
raphy makes the eight hours of 
screening, despite the inaccu-
racies, better than not having 
a show at all. While the mini-
series doesn’t replace the novel 
in its importance or cultural 
relevance, its powerful visual 
impact is an accomplishment 
on its own.

Michigan earns two 

more victories to 
run dual-meet win 

streak to six

By JORDAN HERBSTMAN

For the Daily

It is not often you use the term 

“frustrating” to describe a win, but 
that is how Michigan coach Joe 

McFarland felt after a victory over 
Central Michigan. 

Still, the Michigan wrestling 

team kept rolling this weekend, as 
it took down an in-state rival in the 
19th-ranked Chippewas (2-1 MAC, 
5-3 overall) and a conference foe 
No. 21 Indiana (3-2 Big Ten, 6-2 
overall). Though the Wolverines 
were victorious both Friday and 
Sunday, the two meets could not 
have been more different. 

Friday, Michigan (4-0, 9-1) 

jumped out to an early 9-3 lead, only 

to find itself trailing 12-9 with only 
three matches left. The Wolverines 
suffered two tough losses, as junior 
Brian Murphy gave up a takedown 
in the last 45 seconds of his match 
before redshirt freshman Davonte 
Mahomes lost in a similar fashion. 

Down three points, Michigan 

turned 
to 
junior 
Domenic 

Abounader 
to 
regain 
the 

momentum. Abounader, ranked 
13th in his weight class, dominated 
his opponent and won by technical 
fall, helping the Wolverines regain 

the lead, 14-13. 

“I was really just focusing on 

pushing the pace and finding a 
style of wrestling,” Abounader 
said. “A hard-nosed style where I 
was pushing the pace, being tough 
on top and getting to my boots. 
(That) ended up giving me eight 
points, so that was a difference 
maker in the match.” 

Abounader 
gave 
the 
team 

the momentum it needed, and 
Michigan secured the match,

I tried out for the Michigan football team

Y

ou’ve all heard it before. 
The Michigan football 
season ends, either in 

victory or 
defeat, and 
the team’s 
seniors, after 
playing their 
final game 
in maize and 
blue, talk 
about what 
a privilege 
it is to wear 
the uniform 
of one of the 
most storied programs in college 
football.

Saturday, I found out it has 

nothing to do with tradition 
or a history of excellence. The 
jerseys are just impossible to get 
over a human head.

I put on my No. 6 Michigan 

football jersey Saturday morning 
at 9:15, right before I tried out 
for the Michigan football team 
in Al Glick Field House. Any 
full-time student at Michigan 
could try out, and I was one 
of about 55 to take up the 
opportunity.

I figured putting the jersey 

on would be the easiest part 
of the event. But it turns out 
the bottom of the uniform is 
actually some sort of elastic 
contraption that is almost 
impossible to stretch. My head 
is enormous (physically, but 
I’ve been told metaphorically as 
well), and it took me a minute or 
two to figure out how to actually 
get the jersey 
over my head 
and onto my 
body.

I tried to 

look cool and 
play it off 
afterward, 
and I don’t 
think anyone 
else noticed. 
They were too 
busy discussing their chances of 
actually making the team. I was 
just hoping to survive the tryout.

Playing football has never 

really been on my radar. In 
elementary school, I was 
usually picked last in recess. 
But now that I’m a second-
semester senior and have more 
NCAA eligibility than college 
newspaper eligibility, I thought 
I’d give it a try.

In practicality, it probably 

wasn’t a wise decision. I’m 
5-foot-7 (and one quarter-
inch, according to the official 
measurements at the tryout) 
and 150 pounds. I’m basically 
Dennis Norfleet without speed, 
dance moves or any semblance 
of hand-eye coordination. (For 
full disclosure, I’m not even 
exaggerating about the hand-eye 
coordination issue: I recorded 
a grand total of zero hits in my 
final season of Little League 
when I was in sixth grade.)

My last foray into organized 

athletics came in eighth grade, 
when my friend Zach and I 
decided to join the middle 
school track team. We thought 
it would be a good way to stay 
in shape and hang out with 
our friends. We ran the mile at 
every meet, and it was a rare 
occasion when the two of us 
didn’t finish last.

During the final race of the 

season, our coach gave us a pep 
talk for the ages as we finished 
our third out of five times 
around the track: “Don’t get 
lapped!”

I figure the most practical 

purpose I could serve on the 

Michigan 
football team 
would be as a 
third-string 
long snapper. 
Starter Scott 
Sypniewski 
got hurt last 
season and 
also had to 
play through 
a 103-degree 

fever against Indiana. The 
Wolverines only have one 
true backup at the position in 

Andrew Robinson. What if both 
of them get hurt? Michigan 
will have a new starting center 
next season with Graham 
Glasgow gone, and you can’t 
have his replacement worrying 
about snapping the football on 
special teams.

However, I didn’t see long 

snapper as an option on the 
tryout list, so I opted to try out 
as a fullback. With Joe Kerridge 
and Sione Houma out of the 
picture, maybe Harbaugh would 
be so desperate for a sixth-string 
fullback that I could make the 
cut. With an offseason to get 
ready, I could definitely turn 150 
pounds into 210 pounds.

But first I had to make it 

through the tryout.

We were informed early on 

that we couldn’t use footballs, 
per NCAA rules. Since I struggle 
to catch a football and run at the 
same time, it was welcome news.

We started the tryout by 

warming up with strength coach 
Kevin Tolbert. But warming up 
like a Michigan football player 
isn’t a casual hobby. If you’re 
even so much as a few inches 
out of position, you’re promptly 
called out and told to even out 
the lines. I, somehow, avoided 
scolding.

It turned out that some 

freshman and sophomore walk-
ons who were already on the 
team participated in the tryout, 
so I just looked at what they 
were doing during stretching 
and hoped I wouldn’t look like a 
complete idiot. I only partially 
looked like one.

That changed a few minutes 

later. We started doing high 
knees for 20 yards, and I 
struggled to correctly keep the 
pace. One second I’d be going 
too slow, the next I’d be going 
too fast. We were supposed to be 
perfectly in sync, and I wasn’t.

Next, we had to run 20 yards 

at 75 percent in large groups. 
The problem was, I could tell 
immediately that my 75 percent 
would be nothing compared 

to everyone else’s 75 percent, 
so I ran at 100 percent. I still 
finished last.

I was already panting, before 

the actual drills had even 
started. Just the fact that we 
had to jog every time we moved 
was enough cause for heavy 
breathing.

At some point in the middle 

of all of this, Jim Harbaugh 
appeared, seemingly out of 
nowhere. I mean, he probably 
came from somewhere, but I was 
too tired to notice.

Of course, the first thing 

Harbaugh talked about was 
a competition — the 40-yard 
dash. He invited the guys 
already on the team to run first. 
Then he asked attendees who 
thought they were fast enough 
to keep up to step forward. I 
stayed put.

Harbaugh personally 

administered the 40-yard dash, 
blowing the whistle and telling 
his assistants to pick out the 
fastest guys in each heat.

Mind you, some of the top 

recruits in the country were in 
town this weekend. And yes, 
Jim Harbaugh was watching a 
few of his players and a bunch 
of random students run the 
40-yard dash.

I believe I ran it twice, but 

it could’ve been three times. It 
doesn’t really matter. If worms 
had machine guns, then birds 
would be afraid of them, right?

Sadly, I performed poorly. 

I’m pretty sure I finished last 
in all of my races, but I was 
too focused on not completely 
embarrassing myself to take a 
full look around.

Harbaugh gave the group 

some advice, too. He said you 
can play football by being one 
of three things: fast, tough or 
smart. I know I’m not fast or 
particularly tough (I stood and 
watched the last time I saw a 
brawl at Rick’s), but I figured 
there’s a slight chance I could 
be smart.

That notion was quickly 

dispelled when we broke into 
position groups and took a 
water break. I couldn’t figure 
out how to spray the hose 
contraption we were supposed 
to drink out of, so I just went 
without water until I could 
figure out how to get the water 
out of the hose (I ended up not 
drinking until much later in the 
tryout, so maybe I am tough 
after all).

The next portion of the 

morning wasn’t so torturous. 

We went around to four stations 
in our position groups. At the 
first station, we completed 
lateral high-step drills. I made 
it through without major 
incident, just like I did in the 
second station, where we ran 
around cones. I was slower than 
everyone else, but I didn’t fall 
flat on my face. Huge win, and 
a little bit closer to becoming a 
Michigan football player.

I really starred in the third 

station, where we ran the 
40-yard dash again. We got to 
run it twice. The first time, I 
ran a 5.7. I could hardly breathe 
afterward, but I must’ve 
recovered nicely. I didn’t even 
hear them call out my time after 
my second rep, so I assume 
they must’ve been extremely 
impressed and didn’t want to 
embarrass everybody else. I 
probably ran a 4.2.

Some problems arose in 

the fourth and final station. 
Running backs coach Tyrone 
Wheatley stood in the middle of 
two sets of cones. He motioned 
for us to either run forward or 
backward or to hit the ground 
and pop back up. I tried it three 
times, but messed up horribly on 
each try. He motioned for me to 
go off to the side, where another 
staff member asked if I was 
feeling OK.

I told him I was just bad at 

football. I think he tried to 
reassure me for a second that I 
wasn’t bad, then realized there 
was no point in lying.

I knew I’d have to impress 

in the final stage of the on-field 
portion of the tryout: position 
drills. I was hoping that as a 
fullback, I’d just get to smash my 
head into things, but that wasn’t 
the case.

We did a bunch of offense-

defense drills in which the 
runner had to evade the 
defender in a small area. I wasn’t 
exactly Drake Johnson. I was 
two-hand touched down every 
single time. Once, the defender 
decided to throw me to the 
ground. I should’ve gotten up 
and punched him in the jaw, but 
I was just too worn out. He also 
probably had 60 pounds on me 
and would’ve destroyed me in 
a fight.

My highlight of the day, for a 

moment, came on the defensive 
side of the drill. On one rep, late 
in the drill, I two-hand touched 
my opponent perfectly in the 
shoulders. If I had been allowed 
to tackle, I probably would’ve 
bodyslammed him.

The glory only lasted for a 

moment, though. Wheatley 
immediately started coaching 
the kid on how the running back 
should always win one-on-one 
every time when a defender 
stops moving his feet, which I 
apparently did. Whoops.

After the position drills, 

Harbaugh gathered us as a 
group. He had the walk-ons who 
were already on the team stand 
up, and said they probably stood 
out throughout the tryout. He 
then added they would likely 
take a few other kids from the 
tryout, too.

I’m pretty sure he wasn’t 

talking about me.

Harbaugh rhetorically asked 

us if we would be ready to jump 
right into winter conditioning 
if we were selected. I nodded 
vigorously, figuring that could 
definitely increase my chances.

Then, he had current players 

stay out to evaluate the punters, 
kickers and quarterbacks with 
footballs since the coaches 
weren’t allowed to. He sent the 
rest of us to take more physical 
tests, and we were told we 
would likely hear if we made the 
team by the end of the weekend.

I don’t think I helped my 

chances in the long jump. I 
failed to stick the landing on 
my first two tries, so I went 
conservative on the third try. 
I didn’t hear the final number, 
but I jumped 4-foot-something. 
I didn’t hear any other results 
under 6-feet.

Then they tested how high we 

could jump. I jumped 14 inches, 
which is why my friends call 
me the Jewish Jordan (Editor’s 
note: Nobody calls him that).

Finally, I could see the finish 

line. For the final drill of the day, 
we went into the weight room 
to bench press. I figured I could 
easily bench the bar, maybe a 
little more.

Unfortunately, the only test 

was to see how many reps you 
could do of 225 pounds, so I sat 
off to the side with another kid 
who also couldn’t bench 225 
pounds.

He commented that this 

probably wasn’t good for our 
chances. I don’t know about 
him, but I still haven’t gotten a 
call that I made the team.

I’ll probably stick to writing.

I was just 
hoping to 
survive the 

tryout.

winning by double digits for the 
eighth time this season. Though 
the 
Wolverines 
came 
away 

victorious, they were not pleased.

“I’m 
disappointed,” 
said 

sophomore Alec Pantaleo. “I look 
at my guys, and they have the most 
potential out of any guys I’ve ever 
met. Sometimes you don’t see 
that out on the mat. Don’t get me 
wrong, we came out with a win, 
but I was looking at it and that 
should have been a shutout dual. 
We made careless mistakes.” 

“A few of those guys got beat 

tonight in some close matches, 
they let some guys off the hook 
and it’s tough,” added McFarland. 
“It’s frustrating to see. I mean, it’s 
always nice to get a win. I thought 
we did enough to win. I know I 
wasn’t pleased.” 

After 
a 
frustrating 
win, 

Michigan needed to turn the page 
and refocus for Sunday’s match 
against Indiana. 

But the Wolverines did not start 

the match the way they wanted, 
and it looked as if Sunday’s meet 
was going to be a continuation 
of Friday night’s, when redshirt 
junior Conor Youtsey lost his 
match on a takedown with less 
than 10 seconds remaining. Down 
3-0, Michigan looked to senior 
Rossi Bruno to get the match going. 

Bruno looked strong Sunday 

and beat his opponent handily, 
15-2, earning four points for the 
Wolverines. Michigan continued 
to dominate the match, but the 
highlight came in the 174-pound 
match, when Mahomes defeated 
his opponent on a hard-fought bout, 
9-8. Mahomes’ victory crushed 
any hopes of a Hoosier comeback, 
building the lead to 16-6. 

“174 was a huge match for us,” 

McFarland said. “I knew that 
was gonna be a tight one. We’ve 
been talking to him a lot about 
staying on his offense. When he 
is offensive and scoring points, 
he is hard to beat. He wore 
that kid out at the end and took 
advantage of that third period. 
He had a strong third period, so 
it was fun to see.” 

Michigan could not have asked 

to be in a better position with their 
top three wrestlers yet to wrestle. 
The so-called “Murderer’s Row” 
of Abounader, sixth-year senior 
Max Huntley and junior Adam 
Coon outscored its opponents, 
35-6, with two of the three 
matches ending early by pin.

The Wolverines ended the 

weekend with two wins, though 
they weren’t completely satisfied. 
Still, not being satisfied with 
winning is a pretty good spot for 
the Wolverines find themselves, 
especially this late in the season.

WOMEN’S GYMNASTICS
‘M’ earns first Big 
Ten road triumph

By MATTHEW KENNEDY

Daily Sports Writer

After 
easily 
defeating 
No. 

25 Ohio State a week ago, the 
Michigan women’s gymnastics 
team repeated its dominating 
performance Saturday against No. 
17 Illinois in Champaign.

The third-ranked Wolverines 

(2-0 Big Ten, 5-0 overall), who fell 
from their No. 1 national ranking 
last week, led from the get-go 
and 
never 
relinquished 
their 

lead to defeat the Fighting Illini, 
196.900-195.150. The victory gave 
Michigan its first Big Ten road win 
of the year.

Regardless of whatever event 

was going on, though, one thing 
was always notable: The team 
seemed to be having fun. The 
gymnasts were cheering each 
other on, smiling and doing 
the routines with each other. 
During the floor routine, even the 
normally stern judges cracked 
smiles 
while 
watching 
the 

Michigan gymnasts.

“This is a fun team, this is a 

fun group of girls,” Plocki said. 
“We focus a lot on, the more fun 
we’re having, the more successful 
we’re going to be because having 
fun means you’re relaxed. And 
if you’re relaxed, you’re going to 
go out there and do what you’re 
capable of doing. Typically, if 
you’re nervous and stressed out, 
that’s really not a performance-
enhancing kind of thing.”

The battle for the all-around title 

was significantly closer than the 
meet itself, though with one caveat: 
It was between two Michigan 
gymnasts. Freshman Olivia Karas, 
competing in her home state of 
Illinois, narrowly edged out junior 
All-American Nicole Artz, 39.550-
39.425, to take home the all-around 
crown. Sophomore All-American 
Brianna Brown finished fifth in the 
all-around standings with a score 
of 38.975.

Brown, who was Big Ten 

Co-Freshman of the Year last 
season, had to fill in for senior 
Briley Casanova, who had a minor 
injury, on the vault. Artz also had 
her shin wrapped due to soreness, 
though Plocki said the wrapping 
was there to prevent the soreness 
from turning into an injury.

Michigan started off the night 

extremely strong, with sophomore 
Nichelle Christopherson and senior 
Lindsay Williams both sticking 
their landings on the uneven 
bars. Artz had great extension 
throughout her routine to tie for 
first in the event with a 9.900.

The 
Wolverines 
continued 

to set the night’s dominating 
mood on the vault, where Karas 
propelled herself to a career-
high 9.950. As the Wolverines 
were competing on the vault, two 
different Illinois gymnasts fell off 
the uneven bars, all but spelling 
doom for the Fighting Illini.

Surprisingly, Michigan’s worst 

event of the night was on the floor, 
where it is ranked second in the 
nation. A strong performance on 
the beam, though, guaranteed the 
Wolverines a 47th consecutive 
win against the Illini.

With Illinois, the next-highest 

ranked team in the Big Ten after 
the Wolverines, out of the way, it 
appears that Michigan is in the 
driver’s seat to repeat as Big Ten 
champions. To Michigan coach 
Bev Plocki, though, the victory 
doesn’t change the team’s mindset.

“Our 
goal 
from 
the 
very 

beginning of the year — and for 
several years — has been not only 
to win the Big Ten, but to win a 
national championship,” Plocki 
said. “I really like where we are, 
and we have made improvements 
in all four events. It’s just a matter 
of putting that all together and 
having all of that show up in the 
same competition. That’s when 
we feel like we’ll be really hitting 
our stride.”

Michigan wins twice 
at home tournament

Wolverines rout San 
Francisco, slip past 
No. 23 Kentucky in 

ITA Kick-Off

By TOR THORNE 

For the Daily

The No. 14 Michigan women’s 

tennis team clinched its seventh 
consecutive trip to the ITA National 
Team 
Indoor 
Championships 

this weekend, as the Wolverines 
defeated San Francisco and No. 23 
Kentucky en route to winning the 
ITA Kick-Off.

In Michigan’s sixth consecutive 

year hosting the event, home-
field advantage at a particularly 
noisy 
Varsity 
Tennis 
Center 

helped the Wolverines breeze 
through San Francisco by a score 
of 4-0 on Saturday. In prior weeks, 
Michigan coach Ronni Bernstein 
pressured 
the 

Wolverines 
to cheer each 
other 
on 

to 
create 
a 

louder, livelier 
atmosphere.

Sunday, key 

victories 
by 

freshman Kate 
Fahey at No. 
3 singles and 
senior 
Ronit 

Yurovsky at No. 1 singles gave 
Michigan a 4-3 match victory over 
the Wildcats.

In doubles, aggressiveness at 

the net propelled No. 1 doubles 
pair freshman Brienne Minor and 
sophomore Mira Ruder-Hook and 
No. 2 doubles pair Yurovsky and 
sophomore Alex Najarian to easy 
6-2 victories to earn the doubles 
point for the Wolverines.

In singles, Kentucky grabbed 

the first two points, taking a 2-1 
match lead as Michigan’s No. 4 
and No. 5 singles each fell in two 
sets, 6-1, 6-1, and 6-1, 6-4.

The Wolverines tied the score 

at 2-2 as freshman Brienne 
Minor won the No. 2 singles 
match, 6-2, 6-3.

The bottom of Michigan’s lineup 

continued to struggle, as junior 
Sara Remynse fell in the No. 6 
singles match, 1-6, 5-7, to relinquish 
the team’s lead to the Wildcats.

With the Wolverines down, 

2-3, in the meet, Fahey displayed 
mastery in painting the line, 
taking victories in several long 
vollies and finishing off her 
opponent in the No. 3 singles 
match, 6-3, 6-4.

“It was definitely more pressure 

than I’ve ever felt,” Fahey said. 
“But I was thinking, ‘It’s either 
you or her, and it’s either Michigan 
or Kentucky going to indoors,’ so I 
had to step up and take it.”

After winning the first set, 6-0, 

Yurovsky found herself locked in 
a 6-6 tiebreaker in the second. 
With all eyes on her, Yurovsky 
outlasted 
Kentucky’s 
Aldila 

Sutjiadi to take the set and the 
match for Michigan.

Despite the pressure at the 

end, Yurovsky emphasized the 

importance 
of 
finding 

success 
in 

those 
types 

of 
situations 

going forward.

“I 
was 

shaking 
on 

the 
court,” 

Yurovsky 
said 
with 
a 

laugh. 
“But 

I think what 

got me through this match was 
how I fought and stayed in it and 
competed for every point.”

Despite not getting wins from 

every 
player, 
the 
weekend’s 

tournament 
was 
crucial 
for 

developing a sense of community 
among the Wolverines.

For 
Bernstein, 
finding 

accountability in a multitude of 
places as they did Sunday will be 
key for Michigan’s success going 
forward.

“For 
Brienne 
(Minor) 
and 

Kate (Fahey) to come through 
as freshmen in that situation, 
and Ronit (Yurovsky) clinching 
it when she knew it was on the 
line, that’s what we need to do,” 
Bernstein said.

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Walton earns double-double in win

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Editor

With 2:49 left in the Michigan 

men’s basketball team’s game 
against Nebraska on Saturday, 
junior guard Derrick Walton Jr. 
stepped up to the free-throw 
line. Michigan fans wouldn’t 
have wanted the ball in anyone 
else’s hands. 

After trailing the Cornhuskers 

(4-4 Big Ten, 12-9 overall) for 
less than a minute the entire 
game, Michigan (5-2, 15-5) was 
given a run for its money in the 
final minutes. So, when Walton 
was fouled late in the game, fans 
gave a sigh of relief. He sank 
both free throws, giving the 
Wolverines a more comfortable 
four-point cushion. 

Michigan hung on and then 

some, hitting its final 10 free 
throws in Lincoln to beat the 
Cornhuskers, 81-68.

“When (Walton) had the key 

turnover and all of a sudden it’s a 
two-point game and they fouled 
him and now he goes to the line. 
… I mean those babies hit nothing 
but the bottom of the net,” 
Michigan coach John Beilein told 
reporters. “That shows another 
step in him in just being another 

leader of this team and a guy he 
can look to.”

Walton scored 19 points on 

5-for-8 shooting, grabbed 12 
boards and had six assists — 
three of them coming in the first 
four minutes — to get Michigan 
running right out of the gate. 

He 
first 
found 
freshman 

forward Moritz Wagner, who was 
the first big man off the bench 
following junior forward Mark 
Donnal’s early foul. 

He was there again 26 seconds 

later, feeding it to redshirt 
sophomore 
guard 
Duncan 

Robinson for Robinson’s second 
3-pointer of the night. Another 
26 seconds later, Walton was at 
it again, giving it to sophomore 
forward Aubrey Dawkins from 
beyond the arc. 

All of a sudden, Michigan was 

out to a 12-4 lead. The Wolverines 
made six of their first eight shots. 

“We got off to a really good 

start, and I think that helped 
us a great deal,” Beilein said. “A 
couple of our away games we lost, 
we got off to a very bad start. It 
just wears on you, fighting back. 
I think we had early confidence.”

Though 
the 
Wolverines’ 

defense 
seemed 
impenetrable 

in the first five minutes, the 

Cornhuskers quickly figured out 
how to fight back. They hacked 
away at Michigan’s lead all the 
way up until halftime, when 
they headed into the locker room 
trailing by just three, and again 
in the middle of the second half, 
bringing the game within two 
points in the final two minutes. 

“We 
withstood 
a 
charge 

at the end of the first half, a 
charge during the second half 
— a couple charges during the 
second half,” Beilein said. “I’m 
really proud of the way these 
kids responded to a great college 
atmosphere in Nebraska.”

Walton scored 13 points in the 

second half, including a 3-pointer 
in the game’s final seconds. 
Walton claims he didn’t shoot 
the ball to be disrespectful, even 
though 
the 
Nebraska 
crowd 

booed it, but his teammates and 
coaches told him to shoot it to 
avoid the shot clock violation. 

Walton tends to listen to his 

coaches and teammates, and 
Saturday, he wanted to give most 
of the credit to them. 

“Our coaches did a really good 

job of preparing us,” Walton said. 
“The things that were happening 
out there were things we really 
emulated in practice the last 

couple days. The way we prepared 
really helped me see the floor a 
little easier today and think my 
plays through a little better than 
I usually do.”

Though 
Walton 
earned 
a 

double-double and started his 
team’s rally in the final minutes, 
he seems to be happiest about the 
Wolverines’ ability to play without 
senior captain and guard Caris 
LeVert, who is still recovering 
from a lower-leg injury.

Walton isn’t a captain, but 

with both LeVert and co-captain 
Spike Albrecht cheering from 
the sidelines, he’s shouldering 
most of the responsibility. On 
the road against Nebraska, he 
looked like one. 

“My freshman year at home, we 

had a really good stretch against 
Nebraska, we shot the ball really 
well,” Walton said. “Tonight, it 
was a little different. It was a 
little more special because we 
were down without one of our 
brothers; our leader, Caris, and 
guys were just making some plays 
that he wouldn’t normally make. 

“Looking over and seeing him 

happy for the guys who were 
getting the opportunity with him 
being out, I think it made it a lot 
more special.”

Wolverines top Nebraska

Even without 

LeVert, Michigan 
holds on for fifth 
Big Ten victory

By LEV FACHER

Daily Sports Writer

It took a shout of desperation 

from Derrick Walton Jr. for 
Aubrey Dawkins to realize his 
predicament. Dribbling in the 
wrong 
direction, 
seemingly 

unaware that just three seconds 
remained on the shot clock, 
Dawkins was forced to rise, 
simultaneously fade away and 
perform a 180-degree twist, for 
an impossible shot. 

It was the culmination of yet 

another defensive triumph for 
Nebraska, which refused to the 
bow in the face of Michigan’s 
16-3 
second-half 
run. 
The 

Cornhuskers put the Wolverines 
on lockdown, chipping away at a 
lead that had reached 18 points 
minutes earlier.

Dawkins’ 
shot, 
however, 

found bottom, and the packed 
house at Pinnacle Bank Arena 
in 
Lincoln 
fell 
silent. 
The 

backbreaking 
jumper 
put 
a 

damper 
on 
Nebraska’s 
run, 

which eventually wasn’t enough 
to 
change 
the 
outcome 
in 

Michigan’s 81-68 win Saturday.

The win, which the Wolverines 

opened on an 18-6 run, was the 
opposite of Michigan’s last road 
trip, an 82-71 loss at Iowa last 
Saturday. That game saw the 
Wolverines 
immediately 
fall 

victim to a 9-0 burst from the 
Hawkeyes, but this time, the 
Wolverines came prepared.

“We just have the mindset 

that when we got off the bus, 
we’re down (by) 10,” junior 
forward Zak Irvin told reporters 
after the game. “Against Iowa, 
we had a sluggish start, and that 
hurt us as the game went on. So 
going into today’s game, we just 
wanted to stay together. We had 

a great start to both halves.”

The first-half start was keyed 

by Michigan’s specialty: 3-point 
shooting. The Wolverines stayed 
true to their reputation of a team 
that lives and dies from beyond 
the arc, shooting 52 percent 
from long distance.

Nebraska, on the other hand, 

found no such success from 
the perimeter, especially in the 
face of the 2-3 zone defense 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
employed in the first half. The 
Cornhuskers shot just 6-for-22 
from 3-point range for the game, 
including a 2-for-8 outing from 
Andrew White III.

Instead, 
the 
bulk 
of 

Nebraska’s scoring came in the 
paint, much of it in transition. 
The Wolverines’ 12 turnovers 
prevented them from putting 
the nail in the coffin until the 
final minutes.

“We mishandled the ball, 

(sophomore forward Kameron 
Chatman) had one go through 
his hands — you’re gonna have 
stuff,” Beilein said. “But you’ve 
got to be under 10 (turnovers). 
I really think you’ve got to be 
under 10, or shoot the way (we) 
did tonight.”

As well as it shot, though, 

Michigan changed tacks in the 
second half to take advantage 
of the room it had created in the 
interior, as redshirt sophomore 
guard Duncan 
Robinson 
found himself 
on 
the 

receiving end 
of 
multiple 

backdoor 
passes. 
Robinson, 
leading 
the 
nation 

in 
3-point 

shooting 
percentage, finished consistently 
at the rim, and finished with 
more points scored inside the 
arc than outside for the first 
time as a Wolverine.

“What he’s realizing now is 

that people are going to play him 
a certain way, and his movement 
without the ball is going to be 
really important,” Beilein said. 
“He’s learning — all the video, 

all the synergy 
— that people 
are going to 
sit 
on 
him 

different 
ways, and he’s 
got to do more 
than 
stand 

and wait for 
people to get 
him open.”

Robinson’s 

21 
points 

on 6-for-12 shooting led the 
Wolverines, and Walton added 
19 points of his own while 
cementing his status as the 
team’s 
leading 
rebounder, 

pulling down 12 boards on the 

afternoon.

As they did in Wednesday’s 

74-69 win over Minnesota, the 
Wolverines found success from 
the free-throw line down the 
stretch. Michigan shot 20-for-23 
as a team, including an impressive 
6-for-8 performance from junior 
forward Mark Donnal.

Beilein said in his postgame 

press 
conference 
that 
the 

Wolverines have been practicing 
their 
free-throw 
shooting 

“religiously,” 
in 
end-of-

practice drills wherein players 
have to contend with loud, 
piped-in music to simulate an 
intimidating road environment.

Redshirt freshman guard D.J. 

Wilson did not appear in the 
game, as Beilein opted to use 
only Donnal, freshman Moritz 
Wagner and sophomore Ricky 
Doyle at the ‘5’ spot.

‘M’ falls to Cornhuskers

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Editor

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team has had its fair 
share of surprises this season, 
especially 
its 17-point 
comeback 
against 
Iowa two weeks ago.

But 
this 
time 
around, 
a 

comeback appeared to be out of 
the question no matter how hard 
the Wolverines played.

In Sunday’s game against 

Nebraska, Michigan led for just 
22 seconds after the opening 
basket 
by 
freshman 
center 

Hallie Thome. But within five 
minutes, the Wolverines trailed 
by 15. The Cornhuskers’ offense 
was unstoppable in the opening 
stanza, and Michigan did very 
little to stop it.

Midway through the second 

quarter, the Wolverines (3-5 Big 
Ten, 11-8 overall) brought the 
game to within three points but 
couldn’t finish down the stretch 
as the Cornhuskers (5-3, 14-5) 
escaped with a 93-81 victory in 
Ann Arbor.

“We can’t be giving up 93 

points a game,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico. “That’s 
like the NBA here. … Twenty-
eight points in one quarter is 
just way too much. We gotta get 
better.”

After 
just 
three 
minutes 

in the second half, Michigan 
never cut the deficit to single 
digits. Against forward Jessica 
Shepard 
and 
center 
Allie 

Havers, the Wolverines were 
outscored and outrebounded. 
Though Havers only flirted 
with a double-double, Shepard 
finished with 35 points and 
collected 20 boards.

Meanwhile, Thome — who 

scored 24 points alongside just 
six rebounds — fouled out of 
the game in the fourth quarter 
as Nebraska continued to pack 
the paint. In fact, three other 
Michigan players reached three 

fouls and just junior guard Siera 
Thompson and sophomore guard 
Katelynn Flaherty hit double-
digit scoring otherwise, with 12 
and 14, respectively.

Without 
their 
ability 
to 

drive in the paint, guarded by 
the 
Cornhuskers’ 
best 
bigs, 

Thompson — who reached 1,000 
career points — and Flaherty had 
to shoot from the outside and 
rely on guard-to-guard screens.

“They 
double-teamed 
at 

times, which is an area where 
(Katelynn’s) gonna get better at 
being able to pass out of those 
situations,” Barnes Arico said. 
“But she pretty much, from an 
offensive standpoint, handled 
their pressure and did a decent 
job against them. But we gotta 
get multiple people that are able 
to do that.”

The difference between a 

win and a loss was the opening 
minutes of the game, which 
spelled disaster for Michigan 
right from the start. Smart ball 
movement and crisp passing 
gave Thome the ball inside the 
paint on the first possession 

for a layup. But soon enough, 
Nebraska showed its offense 
was untamable.

In the opening four and a half 

minutes, the Cornhuskers didn’t 
miss a shot from anywhere on 
the court. En route to a 15-point 
lead, they went 8-for-8 from 
the field and 5-for-5 beyond the 
arc. Nebraska quickly jumped 
to 21 points, while Michigan 
added a pair of free throws by 
Thome and just one basket from 
Flaherty — prompting Barnes 
Arico to call a timeout.

The 
Wolverines’ 
original 

plan was to lock down Shepard, 
but guard Kyndal Clark quickly 
emerged as the Cornhuskers’ 
star. She scored all five of her 
team’s 3-pointers in the first 
half and finished the game with 
15 points.

She was the crucial element 

for the Cornhuskers’ huge start, 
forcing Michigan’s defense to 
instead limit Clark’s chances — 
she didn’t score in the second 
half. 
That 
change, 
though, 

opened up Shepard.

“It’s kind of like we’re at the 

point now, it’s ‘pick your poison,’” 
Barnes Arico said. “Totally, our 
whole defensive responsibilities 
and being able to get a stop, being 
able to get multiple stops, we gotta 
become better as a unit on the 
defensive end.”

Michigan strung together two 

scoring runs — a 30-second 8-0 
run in the first quarter and a 7-0 
run in the second — to bring to 
the game within 10 points by the 
break, but the defense couldn’t 
hold the Cornhuskers.

Nebraska had made a large 

enough statement at the start of 
the game to prove they wouldn’t 
give this one up. The damage had 
already been dealt.

“At spurts, we play hard, 

and sometimes it’s too late,” 
Thompson said. “I think that’s 
been the case the last few games. 
We come out, dig ourselves a hole 
and try to fight back, so we just 
have to start playing hard from 
the beginning of the game.

“We always say, ‘We’re never 

out of it,’ but I think we’re at the 
point where we don’t wanna fight 
back anymore.”

Nebraska’s Shepard 
dominant in victory

Cornhusker star 
wins post battle 

with Thome

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan’s 
women 

basketball team’s 93-81 loss to 
Nebraska on Sunday featured 
a notable one-on-one matchup 
down in the paint, where two 
freshman centers duked it out for 
post dominance.

Michigan’s Hallie Thome and 

Nebraska’s Jessica Shepard met 
for the first time in their careers, 
and the latter came out on top.

The Wolverines (3-5 Big Ten, 

11-8 overall) needed Thome to 
be at her best against Nebraska 
(5-3, 14-5), and even though she 
has been a reliable source of 
points and rebounds this season, 
Shepard dominated her in every 
facet of the game.

At first glance, the similarities 

between the two are striking. 
Thome is 6-foot-5, and Shepard 
is 6-foot-4. Both were Gatorade 
High School Player of the Year 
recipients in their home states, 
and both are on pace to have the 
best freshman seasons in their 
schools’ histories.

Thome won the opening tipoff, 

but she didn’t win anything else.

Shepard 
decisively 

outrebounded 
Thome, 
20-6, 

outscored her, 35-24, and also 
managed to stay out of foul 
trouble. The Cornhuskers’ center, 
who has scored over 25 points in 
three other Big Ten games this 
season, put up a performance 
impressive even for someone of 
her caliber.

Shepard’s 20 rebounds were a 

career high, and she is the first 
freshman in Nebraska history to 
have been named to the Naismith 
Player of the Year watch list.

Just six Nebraska freshmen 

have ever scored 400 points in 
one season, and Shepard is just 
two points away from that mark 
— not even midway through the 
Big Ten season.

“Today, 
you 
had 
the 

opportunity to see one of the 
best players in the country,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico, 
referencing 
Shepard. 

“Hallie (Thome) might be a top 
freshman in the country. This 
young lady (Shepard) happens to 
be a freshman and is one of the 
best players in the country.”

The Wolverines did a decent 

job defending Shepard in the first 
quarter — she still scored seven 
points in the first 10 minutes, 
but she went for 23 in the second 
half, and Michigan could not 
slow her down.

Eleven 
of 
Shepard’s 
20 

rebounds came on the offensive 
glass, leading the Cornhuskers to 
23 second-chance points, while 
Michigan had just 13.

“We gave up a lot of offensive 

rebounds for them,” said senior 
guard Madison Ristovksi. “They 
missed shots, but (Shepard) was 
able to just put them back up.”

Once Thome chalked up her 

fourth foul, the Cornhuskers 
found it easier to exploit the 
mismatch in the post. Barnes 
Arico subbed her out, and 
Michigan 
senior 
forward 

Kelsey 
Mitchell 
replaced 

Thome down low. 

Even Ristovski made an effort 

in the paint, but neither found 
success.

Thome eventually fouled out 

of the game in the fourth quarter, 
but by then Nebraska had sealed 
the win.

Barnes Arico couldn’t hold 

back with how impressed she 
was by Shepard.

“She 
is 
an 
unbelievable 

player. We didn’t have an 
answer for her. Shepard is just … 
she’s a monster.”

Oklahoma routs Michigan

By COLE ZINGAS

Heading into the final event, 

the 
No. 
1 
Oklahoma 
men’s 

gymnastics team had done almost 
everything right. The defending 
national champions had scored 
higher than No. 10 Michigan 
in every event, asserting their 
ranking in every way to the crowd 
at Cliff Keen Arena. 

The Wolverines were already 

out of contention for the match 
when 
senior 
Nolan 
Novak 

approached the high bar to 
attempt the event for the second 
time in his career. Yet behind 
him, the team yelled and chanted 
“Let’s Go Blue” in unison with 
the crowd. Novak hit his routine, 
as did his teammates redshirt 
freshman 
Marty 
Strech 
and 

junior Jonathan Chin, earning 
ecstatic cheers from the crowd.

The crowd recognized a solid 

effort by the Wolverines — the 
team improved its season-high 
parallel bar score by 6.05 points 

and its high bar score by 4.8 — at 
the end of a blowout loss.

Michigan (0-4 Big Ten, 1-5 

overall) fell by a score of 444.400-
428.350 to the Sooners (5-0 
overall) on Saturday, but after the 
meet, the attitudes of the players 
and Michigan coach Kurt Golder 
were more positive than negative. 
 

“Overall, I was pretty pleased,” 

Golder said. “As long as we’re 
getting better with every meet, 
we can keep climbing the ladder 
and see how high we can get by 
the end of the year.” 

But 
many 
improved 

performances were overshadowed 
by Oklahoma’s dominance. 

Junior Anthony Stefanelli hit 

both of his routines, including 
an impressive 15.150 on the floor, 
good for third place. Stefanelli, 
however, was the only Wolverine 
in the top seven in that event. 
All-American sophomore Dmitri 
Belanovski scored a career high 
on the pommel horse with a 
14.750, but didn’t even place in the 
top three in the event. 

Oklahoma took first place in 

all six events, as well as in the all-
around. Belanovski had a chance 
to compete for the all-around 
title going into the final event, the 
high bars, which he calls his “best 
event,” but he fell and scored a 
13.800. 

“I’ve got to learn to finish,” 

Belanovski said. “I hit the first 
five, but you’ve got to go out there 
and hit the sixth event. I can’t 
make a mistake like that.”

Meanwhile, Yul Moldauer from 

Oklahoma scored an incredible 
16.000 in his final routine to take 
the meet by more than a point. 
Belanovski finished tied for third 
in the all-around.

Michigan is pleased with its 

improvement of 15 points from its 
performance at the Windy City 
Invitational on Jan. 17, but after 
facing Oklahoma, it knows how 
much work is left to do.

Saturday, the Wolverines hit 

75 percent of their routines, up 
from 50 percent the previous 
weekend. Golder wants to get 

that number up to between 80 
and 85 percent, which he says is 
championship form. Golder is 
looking for Michigan to increase 
the degree of difficulty in its 
routines as well.

“The routines these guys are 

doing may not look easy, but by our 
championship standards, some of 
them are easy,” Golder said.

For the athletes, the key 

to 
achieving 
Golder’s 
goals 

will be keeping energy high 
and 
maintaining 
confidence 

throughout meets. When the 
Wolverines rallied behind Novak 
on the high bars, that mindset was 
on full display.

“It’s all about keeping the 

energy up,” Belanovski said. “If 
the team’s not behind you, you’re 
going to go out there and you 
know you’re going to flop, you’re 
gonna fall.”

“I truly believe that this team, 

when it’s six up six count, can go 
36 for 36. And I think this year 
especially, that’s what it’s going to 
take. This team can do it.”

MEN’S TENNIS
Wolverines drop 
first dual match

By KATIE CONKLIN

Daily Sports Writer

Alex Knight was a comeback 

kid this Sunday at the Boone 
Indoor Tennis Center, where 
Michigan 
faced 
Kentucky.

After 

dropping 
the 
first 
doubles 

match of the day, 6-2, alongside 
freshman Myles Schalet, the 
redshirt sophomore entered his 
single match ready for revenge.

Down in the first set, Knight 

eventually 
brought 
it 
to 
a 

tiebreaker, pulling out a 9-7 
win. Taking advantage of this 
momentum, he wrapped up the 
second set with a 6-4 victory to 
take the match. 

Knight’s 
matchup 
against 

Trey Yates was the seventh 
match of the day for Michigan 
and acted as the turning point 
for the Wolverines, leading 
to their three-match winning 
streak.

The streak, though, only 

brought the Wolverines within 
one, resulting in a 4-3 loss in 
their first dual-match play of the 
2016 season.

Michigan junior Kevin Wong 

added to the streak, coming 
out on top against Kentucky’s 
Charles Minc in two consecutive 
7-6 tiebreakers.

“(Kevin) 
played 
really 

aggressively 
today,” 
said 

Michigan men’s tennis coach 
Adam Steinberg. “I really liked 
the way he struck the ball.”

The third and final point 

for the Wolverines came from 
Schalet in his first official 
season match in the maize and 
blue. Playing in the No. 6 singles 
position, Schalet captured a 
narrow victory against Enzo 
Wallart in the only three-set 
match of the day.

Winning the first set, 7-5, 

Schalet went into the second 
unscathed. 
Wallart, 
though, 

pulled out a win in a 9-7 
tiebreaker, evening the match.

Because 
the 
team 
match 

was 
already 
decided, 
as 

Michigan was down, 4-2, it was 
determined that Schalet and 
Wallart would play a 10-point 
superbreaker rather than a third 
and final set.

Though there was no team win 

in sight for Michigan, Schalet 
made 
sure 
the 
Wolverines 

traveled back to Ann Arbor with 
one final point, winning the 
deciding tiebreaker, 13-11.

“There were a lot of positives, 

but overall, we’re all competitors 
and we want to win,” Steinberg 
said. “We came here for one 
reason, to be successful. We 
wanted to get a win to start the 
year.”

Michigan 
was 
down 
1-0 

from the start, losing both of its 
doubles matches — 6-2 at the No. 
3 spot and 6-4 at the No. 1 spot. 
The third match was stopped 
after Kentucky had won two 
of the three doubles matches, 
clinching the doubles point.

Steinberg’s 
solution 
for 

disjointed doubles play was 
simple: “Our intensity at the 
beginning needs to be much 
better, and we need to play as a 
team more.

“I didn’t think we played 

with that fight and passion 
that we do in practice. We’re 
disappointed.”

Such 
disappointment 

continued 
into 
the 
first 

three singles matches, as the 
Wolverines dropped matches 
in the first, second and third 
singles positions.

But Michigan is taking its 

final three-game stretch as a 
positive, despite the debacle 
against the Wildcats.

“The guys showed a lot of 

character by fighting like that 
until the end,” Steinberg said. 
“It gives us good momentum 
going into next week.”

And it is this momentum 

that the Wolverines are going 
to need, as this past weekend 
marked the start of what they 
hope will be a successful season.
