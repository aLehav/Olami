CELEBRATING OUR ONE-HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Higher education, 

K-12 programs 
slated to receive 
funding increases

By SHOHAM GEVA 
and JACK TURMAN

Daily News Editor and 

Daily Staff Reporter

Despite a projected short-

fall in Michigan both this fiscal 
year and next, higher education 
received a funding increase in 
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder’s 
budget announcement Wednes-
day morning.

In 
a 
presentation 
to 
the 

state’s lawmakers, the governor 
announced the state budget for 
the 2016 fiscal year as well as revi-
sions to the 2015 fiscal year bud-
get. Those changes are intended 
to account for a deficit, which was 
announced at the state’s biannual 
revenue estimating conference in 
January. Administration officials 
have attributed the deficit to an 

unprecedented number of busi-
nesses recently cashing in on tax 
credits issued over the past sev-
eral years.

Snyder proposed a 2-percent 

increase to university funding 
and 1.4-percent increase in com-
munity college funding, a move 
similar to his previous budgets. 
Nonetheless, the overall level 
of state higher education fund-
ing remains lower than it was at 
the start of his tenure, due to a 
15-percent cut the governor rec-
ommended in 2011.

Even with the unexpected 

shortfalls, Snyder told reporters 
at a press conference Wednesday 
afternoon he was pleased with 
the budget proposal.

“We should be very proud of 

the economic outcomes of our 
state so far and the future of our 
state looks very bright,” Snyder 
said.

Last month, the House Fis-

cal Agency projected a $454.4 
million deficit, but State Budget 
Director John Roberts updated 
that number in a recent report to

‘U’ community 

remembers victims 

of shooting

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

Members of the University 

community gathered Wednes-
day night for a candlelight vigil 
on the Diag to honor the memory 

of three Muslim students shot 
and killed in Chapel Hill, North 
Carolina.

Dental student Deah Shad-

dy Barakat, 23; his wife, Yusor 
Mohammad Abu-Salha, 21; and 
her sister Razan Mohammad 
Abu-Salha, 19, were all found 
dead in their apartment Tuesday 
evening.

Police linked it to a dispute 

over parking, but are also inves-
tigating the incident as a poten-

tial hate crime. All three of the 
victims were Muslim.

Holding cups containing can-

dles, roughly 200 people gath-
ered around memorial candles 
placed on the ground to spell out 
“CHAPEL HILL” before listen-
ing to several speeches and reci-
tations made by students, faculty 
and community members deliv-
ered from the steps of Hatcher 
Graduate Library.

The 
University’s 
Muslim 

Student Association hosted the 
hour-long event.

Barakat was a second-year 

dental student at the Univer-
sity of North Carolina. His wife 
was planning to enter the same 
school in the fall. Razan Moham-
mad Abu-Salha was an architec-
ture and environmental design 
student at North Carolina State 
University in Raleigh.

60 students vote 
to donate funds for 
foster care support 

program

By PAIGE PFLEGER

Daily Staff Reporter

A crowd of 60 students slurped 

soup and raised money for 
Detroit-based charities Wednes-
day evening as part of The Soup, 
the second event of the Univer-
sity’s first-ever Detroit Week.

Organized by the Detroit Part-

nership, the Black Student Union, 
the Black Volunteer Network, 
Semester in Detroit and the LSA 
Student 
Government, 
Detroit 

Week is hosting three events to 
examine problems the facing the 
city as well as promote communi-
ty outreach. The week kicked off 
Monday with a panel on race and 
food in the city and will conclude 
Saturday with a volunteer project 
at the Franklin Wright Settle-
ment in Detroit.

Inspired by Detroit SOUP, a 

monthly dinner that funds micro-

grants for Detroit-based projects, 
The Soup raised $325 for charity 
by providing students with a $5 
soup dinner and an opportunity 
to vote for the charity who would 
receive the proceeds from the 
event.

All the participating organi-

zations, including Detroit Urban 
Debate Education, Society of 
Hispanic Professional Engineers 
and the Loud Voice Movement, 
are campus groups with the mis-
sion of empowering youth in the 
Detroit community.

“I love this event because it 

continues the engagement with 
Detroit, and allows the Detroit 
Partnership to collaborate with 
other groups,” said Public Policy 
junior Blair Sucher, education 
director for the Detroit Partner-
ship. “To me, that’s so important, 
because it’s awesome to see peo-
ple from all areas of study come 
out and support Detroit.”

Each organization presented 

their mission and service goals 
while students ate their soup.

Oregon governor decides against 
leaving post amidst controversy Washtenaw County hit 

hard by influenza this year 

Experts tie 

increased number 
of illnesses to low 
vaccine efficacy

BY ANASTASSIOS 
ADAMOPOULOS

Daily Staff Reporter

As flu season continues, 

Washtenaw 
County 
has 

experienced 
a 
spike 
in 

influenza cases, as well as 
several deaths.

According 
to 
Shantell 

Kirkendoll, 
senior 
public 

relations representative for the 
University of Michigan Health 
System, UMHS has reported 13 
flu-related deaths for the 2014-
2015 season as of Wednesday.

At University Health Service, 

Chief Health Officer Robert 
Winfield said physicians have 
seen 156 flu-related cases.

The 
number 
of 
patients 

in December alone was 89. 
Winfield said the number of 
cases in January is not yet 
available, but noted the figure 
was lower than December’s.

Last 
month, 
UMHS 

implemented 
a 
policy 

encouraging people with flu-
like symptoms to avoid visiting 
patients at the hospital.

Eden 
Wells, 
clinical 

associate 
professor 
of 

epidemiology, said recent flu 
seasons have been unusually 
mild, unlike the current cycle. 
She said many people weren’t 

accustomed to the flu posing a 
serious problem.

The effectiveness of this 

year’s vaccine for the H3N2 
virus — about 23 percent — 
presents 
a 
unique 
element 

to the current flu season. 
According 
to 
the 
Centers 

for Disease Control, this is 
approximately 50 percent less 
effective than in usual years.

In Washtenaw County, eight 

patients have died from the 
flu this season. The death toll 
is lower for the county than 
at UMHS because the health 
system treats patients from 
several counties.

According to the CDC, this 

year has been the most fatal 
flu season nationally for people 
older than 65 years old since 
the CDC began collecting data 
on influenza in 2005.

Wells said the vaccine is 

designed to address several 
different 
virus 
strains 

compared to the previous year’s 
version. She said flu experts at 
the World Health Organization 
conduct a number of studies 
around the world based on 
those strains to try and predict 
which strains will circulate in 
the fall.

“You 
start 
making 
the 

vaccine, 
and 
it 
takes 
six 

months to make the vaccine,” 
she said. “Sometimes that (flu) 
virus loves to kind of slightly 
mutate throughout the year 
— that what ended up finally 
circulating this fall was not-
quite matched to the vaccine 
that was made in February”.

In 
an 
e-mail 
interview, 

Epidemiology 
Prof. 
Arnold 

Monto wrote that the disease 
changed 
in 
the 
Northern 

Hemisphere 
during 
the 

summer.

“A lot of work is going on to 

develop a vaccine that does not 
have to be redesigned for each 
vaccine strain,” Monto wrote. 
“This past year’s experience 
shows why that is important.”

He noted that Ann Arbor 

residents tend to vaccinate 
more than national average, but 
said that’s been less effective 
this year because the vaccine 
hasn’t worked as well.

“We are involved in several 

studies which look at the 
occurrence of influenza in 
the Ann Arbor area, and how 
well the vaccine is working,” 
Monto wrote. “This has been 
a bad influenza season in our 
area, with a lot of illnesses and 
hospitalizations with type A 
(H3N2) influenza”.

Still, Wells said vaccination 

remains the best tool to prevent 
the flu. She noted the message 
has been well-received locally 
due to the intensity of this 
year’s influenza season and 
the 
recent 
return 
of 
the 

measles. In recent weeks, the 
reappearance of measles has 
sparked 
discussion 
on 
the 

merits of vaccination.

“We 
are 
hearing 
more 

now 
from 
people, 
parents, 

community members who are 
actually taking up the banner 
for vaccine,” Wells said. “So, I 
think that’s a good thing.”

John Kitzhaber 
faces scrutiny for 
fiancée’s policy 
work, office use

SALEM, Ore. (AP) — Embat-

tled Oregon Gov. John Kitzha-
ber had reached a decision to 
resign because of an ethics 
scandal surrounding him and 
his fiancée, but he changed his 
mind, three people with direct 

knowledge of the situation said 
Wednesday.

They said the Democratic 

governor informed some of his 
aides on Sunday that he was 
going to resign and on Tues-
day he asked his would-be 
successor, Secretary of State 
Kate Brown, to rush back from 
a conference in Washington 
D.C. They spoke to The Associ-
ated Press on condition of ano-
nymity because they were not 
authorized to talk about private 
discussions.

Brown’s abrupt and unex-

plained 
return 
to 
Oregon 

sparked 
speculation 
that 

Kitzhaber 
planned 
to 
quit. 

Hours later, Kitzhaber issued 
a statement saying he would 
stay put. It was not clear why 
Kitzhaber changed his mind.

“Let me be as clear as I was 

last week, that I have no inten-
tion of resigning as Governor of 
the state of Oregon,” Kitzhaber 
said in a statement. “I was elect-
ed to do a job for the people of 
this great state and I intend to 
continue to do so.”

The governor told KGW that 

he asked Brown, a Democrat, to 
return from Washington so he 
could tell her he was not resign-
ing.

Newspaper editorial boards 

and Republican political opera-
tives 
have 
been 
criticizing 

Kitzhaber and calling for him to 
leave office over allegations that 
his fiancée, Cylvia Hayes, used 
his office to land contracts for 
her consulting business. She’s 
accused of advocating policies 
that she was paid to promote.

Hayes 
has 
been 
under 

increasing scrutiny since Octo-
ber, when a series of reports 
chronicled her work for orga-
nizations with an interest in 
Oregon public policy, which 
came as she served as an unpaid 
adviser in the governor’s office.

The focus led Hayes to reveal 

that she accepted about $5,000 
to illegally marry an immigrant 
seeking immigration benefits in 
the 1990s. Later, she acknowl-
edged purchasing a remote 
property with the intent to ille-
gally grow marijuana.

Kitzhaber, meanwhile, has 

denied wrongdoing, saying he 
and Hayes took steps to avoid 
conflicts of interest. Attorney 
General Ellen Rosenblum has 
launched a criminal investiga-
tion.

Kitzhaber was re-elected by a 

wide margin in November, eas-
ily defeating Republican state 
Rep. Dennis Richardson.

Goofy, competitive mix for Michigan

Wolverines mix 
sharp focus, fun 

antics on game days

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

It’s a common misconception 

that the recipe for winning only 
includes competitiveness. You 
also need a pinch of humor.

The ingredients seem like 

they wouldn’t work, but for the 
Michigan softball team, they 
do. They coexist, and neither 
outweighs the other.

On the bus ride to any game, 

the Wolverines are dancing and 
having fun. But when their foot 
gets off the last step of the bus 
and onto the pavement, they flip 
a switch.

“Off the field we have a 

blast, but when it’s time to get 
serious, we definitely get down 
to business,” said senior catcher 
Lauren Sweet.

Added junior shortstop Sierra 

Romero: “(Sophomore infielder 
Lindsay Montemarano) and I go 
back and forth, like she makes 
an error and I’ll be like ‘I won’t 
make that error,’ so we joke 
about it, but it brings out our 
competitive side.”

The ability to remain relaxed 

and focused at the same time 
helps the team, especially in 
tough situations. With a team 
full of best friends, they love 
to compete for each other and 
strengthen their connection on 
and off the diamond.

“If you’re tense and worried 

about it, you’re obviously not 
going to play your best,” Sweet 
said. “But the fact that we have 
that bond and can mess around 
with each other and have fun 
before the game, I think it’s an 
awesome thing. When we’re on 
the field and we’re all down, 
someone can make us laugh in 
the game and get us back up.”

The 
team’s 
traditions, 

especially cheers in the dugout, 
keep the Wolverines loose while 
they’re at the plate. Sweet could 
be hailed as the team DJ, making 
the beats and laying down 
the foundation for upcoming 
chants. She embraces this role, 
but thinks that outsiders might 
not fully understand what’s 
going on.

“Our cheers are kind of out 

there and people probably think 
we’re really weird,” Sweet said. 
“For (Romero), we have one like 
‘give her the Kool-Aid.’ It’s an 
inside joke.”

The inside jokes don’t stop 

there, though, but continue with 
the Wolverines’ obsession over 
pizza.

“We view going around the 

bases — getting to first, second 
and third — as making a pizza,” 
said junior Kelsey Susalla. “So 
our goal is to make a pizza (and 
eat it) once we get home. On 
second base, we sprinkle the 
cheese.”

The team loves to have fun, 

but coach Carol Hutchins knows 
that her team is locked in on 
its goals and is most certainly 
disciplined.

“Kids like to have fun, but 

it’s not the goal,” Hutchins said. 
“The goal is to play games and 
win them. The goal is to get 
better every week. That doesn’t 
mean you won’t have fun — fun 
is a sidebar.”

Hutchins quipped that rec 

leagues are the place where fun 
is the main focus. Of course, with 
the Michigan softball program, 
championships are in the front 
of team’s mind. She likens 
defending something — such as 
a Big Ten championship, which

Hutchins 
wants 
her 

players’ personalities to work 

well 
together 
and 
achieve 

one collective duty: making 
Michigan 
softball 
great. 

According to her, that’s the only 
reason to put on a maize and 
blue uniform.

Still, Hutchins does enjoy her 

team’s goofy side when it isn’t a 
detriment to the team.

“I think this team is very 

passionate 
about 
Michigan 

softball and they care about 
each 
other 
as 
teammates,” 

Hutchins said. “We talk about 
team 
chemistry, 
and 
team 

chemistry isn’t about caring 
about each other and being 
friends. Team chemistry helps 
you win games.”

This weekend, the Wolverines 

play Florida State, the team that 
knocked them out of the NCAA 
Super Regional last season. They 
aren’t looking back on the walk-
off home run that ended it all, 
but they’re remaining goofy and 
competitive as always. When 
their feet hit the pavement 
in Tallahassee, Florida this 
weekend, they will have already 
flipped the switch.

And when they make pizza, 

the 
toppings 
are 
always 

goofiness and competitiveness. 
Extra cheese.

$325 million.

The 2016 budget also faced a 

projected shortfall of $532 mil-
lion. To address both shortfalls, 
the governor made cuts to mul-
tiple state agencies. Most severely 
impacted were the State Police, 
the Department of Corrections 
and the Department of Commu-
nity Health, which will see cuts of 
more than $23 million, $17.8 mil-
lion and $16.55 million, respec-
tively.

However, for the state’s schools 

and universities, the news was 
more positive. During his address, 
Snyder emphasized the impor-
tance of investing in education, 
along with skilled trades and pub-
lic safety

“The same time when we’re 

cutting a number of programs, 
we’re making investments, invest-
ments in critically important 
things,” Snyder told reporters.

Citing both K-12 schools and 

higher 
education 
institutions, 

Snyder said maintaining invest-
ment in education was one of the 
administration’s key consider-
ations when making cuts to state 
agency budgets.

“The way I viewed it is we’re 

going to protect students,” he 
said. “We’re not asking for sacri-
fices from any of those groups.”

Last year, Snyder’s executive 

budget proposal totaled $52.1 bil-
lion and featured a 6.1-percent 
increase for higher education 
funding. The 6.1-percent increase 
was the largest increase to higher 
education funding since 2001. In 
2012, he recommended a 3.1-per-
cent raise; in 2013, a 2.2-percent 
raise.

“Going back to the increased 

education budget, I think that’s 
been validated multiple times that 
we’ve been investing in education 
and we continue to invest in edu-
cation,” Snyder told reporters.

Cynthia Wilbanks, the Uni-

versity’s vice president for gov-
ernment 
relations, 
said 
the 

University plans to work closely 
with state officials as the budget 
proposal progresses through the 
legislature.

“We certainly appreciate the 

governor’s recommendation for 
additional state funding, espe-
cially in the constrained budget 
environment this year,” she wrote 
in a statement. “This maintains 
the momentum of increased state 
investment in higher education.”

Don Grimes, senior research 

associate for the University’s 
Institute for Research on Labor, 
Employment and the Economy, 
said given the deficit, he was sur-
prised to see the higher educa-
tion funding increase, along with 
the proposal to elevate wages for 
skilled trades students.

“They seemed to have been able 

to make good use of their revenue 
that they have been able to find,” 
Grimes said. “I didn’t expect that 
large of increase in university 
appropriations.”

However, Grimes cited the 

continual need to reform corpo-
rate business firms cashing in on 
tax credits, which was a major 
contributor to this fiscal year’s 
budget deficit.

“They shouldn’t be allowed to 

do that all in one period,” Grimes 
added. “In other words, they 
should be forced to get those tax 
credits spread out over a number 
of years.”

Similar to budgets from the 

past three years, the governor’s 
recommendation also set aside 
additional funding for univer-

sities that meet performance 
metrics or cap tuition raises at a 
certain percent. Last year, the cap 
was 3.2 percent, which the Uni-
versity met by raising tuition 1.6 
percent. This year, the cap will be 
2.8 percent.

Additionally, the proposal allo-

cated $500,000 for sexual assault 
prevention on college campuses. 
Over the past year, two universi-
ties in the state — Michigan State 
University and the University 
of Michigan — have come under 
federal investigation for how they 
address sexual assault reporting.

Snyder didn’t cite specific cir-

cumstances prompting the fund-
ing during his announcement.

“I believe it’s appropriate to 

make an investment,” he told law-
makers.

According to budget docu-

ments released by Snyder’s office, 
the $500,000 will be a one-time 
allocation to “provide a system 
wide approach to develop com-
prehensive prevention best prac-
tices, assessment strategies, and 
effective response efforts.”

Education Prof. Betty Over-

ton-Adkins said she was pleased 
overall that the budget proposal 
included an increase to higher 
education funding.

“If Michigan is going to con-

tinue to keep pace with the rest of 
the nation in terms of continuing 
to provide a very strong program 
of higher education for its citi-
zens, we certainly need it to have 
a contingent consideration for 
increases to our budget,” she said.

Overton-Adkins added that the 

increase of funding could lead to 
additional funding from other 
outside sources.

“When the legislature and 

governor signaled their support 
for higher education, it also is a 
catalyst for other agencies and 

organizations also to support us,” 
Overton-Adkins said. “I think in 
some ways it also helps to attract 
additional dollars, because we can 
point to the support that the state 
provided the institution.”

Along with higher education, 

K-12 programs and skilled trades 
programs also received a boost. 
The governor proposed a 75-per-
cent increase from the amount 
currently spent on skilled trades 
programs — from $47.6 million 
to $83.2 million. He also recom-
mended $25 million in support for 
a new initiative to increase third-
grade reading scores in the state 
and $75 increase in per-pupil 
funding for K-12 schools.

After 
the 
budget 
presenta-

tion, Lt. Gov. Brian Calley briefly 
discussed an upcoming ballot 
proposal, which would increase 
Michigan’s sales tax to pay for fixes 
to the state’s roads. The 2016 fiscal 
year budget doesn’t assume pas-
sage of that proposal, Calley said.

Snyder told reporters later in 

the day that the road legislation, 
which was signed last year but 
goes before voters in May, simpli-
fies the use of the fuel tax and the 
sales tax.

“Fuel taxes go to local govern-

ment roads,” Snyder said. “It’s a 
straightforward, comprehensive 
tax structure … that provides both 
certainty and adequate resources 
that can go both to (the) trans-
portation system that our people 
deserve and the education system 
is protected in the meantime.”

If passed, the restructuring 

would impact the way universi-
ties are funded. A percentage of 
a university’s overall state alloca-
tions would stem from the gener-
al fund instead of the School Aid 
Fund, which would be restricted 
to community colleges and K-12 
programs under the proposal.

had a lasting impact on women of 
color who are involved in the arts 
during the opening portion.

Robin Wilson, the 2013 recipi-

ent of the Shirley Verrett Award 
and also a member of the steering 
committee, presented Goodison 
with the award. Wilson said the 
award honors women of color in 
the arts who are often considered 

an outlier, and are interested in top-
ics not always valued by the major-
ity of scholars.

“When you look around this 

campus, when you look things 
that are named after people, 
there are no Black people,” she 
said. “This (award) is something 
we could create that would have 
longevity and would signify our 
presence on this campus. Being 
a woman of color and in the arts 
who had a special interest in 
women who were in the arts and 
in particular women of color.”

Throughout 
the 
ceremony, 

Goodison was recognized for 
encouraging and inspiring female 
faculty and students from diverse 
backgrounds.

Robert Sellers, vice provost for 

equity, inclusion and academic 
affairs, said Verret’s spirit and 
influence lived on through Goodi-
son’s 
teaching, 
performance, 

scholarship and service.

The award ceremony included 

a musical performance by Ver-
rett’s former opera students and a 
poetry reading in tribute to Goodi-

son by University alum Zilka Joseph, 
one of Goodison’s former students 
and distinguished poet.

In an interview after the event, 

Joseph said while she was a stu-
dent, Goodison was an incredibly 
welcoming and caring professor.

“(She) was present and so kind 

and made you feel like home — 
someone who embraced you,” 
Joseph said. “We need people like 
Lorna in an environment which 
becomes almost like a machine. 
Sometimes we forget we are just 
human beings.”

shooter as 46-year-old Craig 
Stephen Hicks, who also lived in 
the apartment complex. While 
the suspect’s wife said in a press 
conference that her husband 
was not motivated by religion, 
members of the victims’ families 
have argued the incident should 
be characterized as a hate crime. 
No motive has yet been officially 
identified.

The Daily Tar Heel, UNC’s 

student newspaper, reported 
large crowds had gathered to 
attend a vigil on campus Mon-
day night.

At the vigil in Ann Arbor, 

many students addressed Islam-
ophobia in the United States. 
They expressed anger over what 
they called the U.S. media’s 
biased coverage of the Cha-
pel Hill shooting, and said the 
deaths should be seen as a hate 
crime.

“We’re doing this ceremony 

because we think it’s important 
to bring the awareness that this 
was done because of hate crime,” 
said Education senior Sheza 
Mansoor, a member of the MSA.

Mansoor also stressed the 

importance of the vigil for 
bringing together students of all 
different identities on campus.

“We shouldn’t be differenti-

ated by our religion or race or 
culture,” he said. “We all stand 
together because it’s part of 
humanity to stand against injus-
tice, and this is complete injus-
tice.”

Faculty and staff members 

also attended the vigil to dem-
onstrate support for Muslim stu-
dents on campus.

Trey Boynton, director of the 

Office of Multi-Ethnic Student 
Affairs, who spoke during the 
ceremony, expressed the impor-

tance of coming together in 
times of tragedy in an interview 
with The Michigan Daily after 
the event.

“Vigils like this allow us to 

come together in community, 
and mourn together, and be 
sad together, and ask for jus-
tice together,” Boynton said. “I 
think that that’s important when 
you’re feeling deeply saddened 
by an act of violence like this.”

Engineering graduate student 

Andrew Lynch, who partici-
pated in the vigil, said the event 
was representative of the Uni-
versity’s diverse community and 
growing atmosphere of accep-
tance.

“The fact that we are at Mich-

igan means that we always are 
willing to make space for every-
body at the table, and that every-
one’s welcome to express who 
they are,” Lynch said.

However, in terms of the Uni-

versity’s atmosphere of inclusiv-
ity, Lynch said there was still 
some improvement to be made.

“We’re working on it,” he 

said. “I think we’re better off 
than a lot of places, but we still 
absolutely have a lot of work left 
to do.”

LSA senior Saher Rathur, who 

spoke during the ceremony, said 
she was happy to see both Mus-
lim and non-Muslim students 
gathered at the vigil.

“I think it was really impor-

tant for the Muslim community 
on campus to see that solidar-
ity from people who aren’t Mus-
lim,” Rathur said.

However, Rathur added that 

Islamophobia is an ongoing issue 
for the Muslim community, and 
both the Muslim and non-Mus-
lim community have to work 
together to combat it.

“A lot of times we’re told 

that whatever we’re feeling, in 
terms of when people say hei-
nous things to us, or do heinous 

death, as well as more general 
concerns about law enforce-
ment in Ann Arbor. The groups 
included Ann Arbor to Fer-
guson, Ann Arbor Concerned 
Citizens for Justice, the Uni-
versity’s Trotter Multicultural 
Center and Black Lives Matter.

An HRC subcommittee has 

been organized to examine 
the potential organization of a 
civilian oversight board for the 
police, City Council announced 
last month. The subcommittee 
members will present propos-
als and findings based on their 
research. More specific charac-
teristics of the oversight board 
would be detailed during the 
process of its formation.

Pamela Dent, another mem-

ber of the HRC, noted that the 
HRC would be able to establish 
the civilian oversight board 
because it is already in the 
charter’s commission, but it 
would still need to be approved 
by City Council. She stressed 
that the creation of the com-
mittee has not yet been agreed 
upon.

“We have a history of doing 

exhaustive research to support 
whatever we may ultimately 
recommend so that we don’t 
sustain any push back, if you 
will, and we are successful 
with what we ultimately deter-
mine,” Dent said.

Mohammad Issa, one of the 

oversight subcommittee mem-
bers, said he 
has been 

in contact with other cities to 
find out how their own over-
sight boards work, including 
their role and limitations.

The commission has set Feb. 

23 as a deadline for the sub-
committee to submit propos-
als on the potential oversight 
board. The subcommittee will 
meet again on Feb. 25.

Along with the proposed 

oversight board, Wilson said 
he and fellow HRC member 
Linda Winkler have met with 
Ann Arbor Police Chief John 
Seto and discussed the train-
ing received by officers, as well 
as racial composition for the 
police force according to rank 
and in proportion to population 
breakdown.

Wilson said Seto is aware of 

the negative perceptions sur-
rounding Ann Arbor police 
officers and wants to change 
that.

“He said that he is open to 

doing more things to make 
people understand that they 
are human beings,” he said. 
“And more fun things with the 
community.”

The report for the civilian 

police oversight subcommittee 
will include the information 
Seto gave the two members, 
Wilson said.

“We made it clear that this is 

more than Aura’s death,” Wil-
son said. “Right now we’re talk-
ing about prevention because a 
life has been lost. And it shall 
not, cannot come back. And 
that where we are in our soci-
ety, is that police officers sup-
posedly are employees.”

throughout the Detroit area to 
teach debating techniques, form 
debate teams and send debaters 
to national tournaments. Since its 
establishment in 2009, the group 
has grown to include more than 250 
students from 18 high schools, and 
boasts a 100-percent graduation 
rate for its participants.

The Society of Hispanic Pro-

fessional Engineers created a 
program called SHPE Jr., an out-
reach campaign at Western Inter-

national High School in Detroit. 
SHPE aims to inspire Hispanic 
youth to pursue careers in sci-
ence, technology, engineering and 
math.

Attendees ultimately voted for 

the donation to go toward the 
Loud Voice Movement, an organi-
zation seeking to empower indi-
viduals in the foster care system 
in Detroit. The money will go 
toward recruitment and bringing 
in speakers for workshops, as well 
as help fund the group’s overall 
functions.

As a Detroit native who spent 

time in the foster care system, LSA 

senior Kamille Tynes, the Loud Voice 
Movement founder, emphasized the 
importance of providing advocacy, 
leadership and professional devel-
opment training for foster youth 
during her presentation.

“Right now, only 2 percent of 

the national population of foster 
youth make it to college,” Tynes 
said. “One of the issues that is so 
near and dear to my heart is edu-
cation, because I know like you 
guys know, that’s the way to suc-
ceed in life. But if you don’t have 
the support system, or the skills or 
the resources to do it, you won’t be 
able to achieve it. No matter how 

smart you are.”

Tynes created the Loud Voice 

Movement three years ago when 
she was struggling academically 
in her first year at the University. 
She said she knew that if she was 
struggling, other foster kids were 
probably struggling, too. She took 
a class about community organiz-
ing to research the best ways to 
get the group on its feet, and last 
year she formally launched the 
program.

“I am so grateful that people 

could hear the passion, and that 
they want to support what we’re 
doing in Detroit,” Tynes said.

W

omen are taught to be 
disgusted by their bodi-
ly functions. They are 

taught not to burp, 
fart or hiccup in 
public. When men 
experience 
natu-

ral cycles of the 
human body that 
occur throughout 
the day, farts are 
often funny, burps 
are loud and spit-
ting shows a sign 
of true manliness. 
In a human body, 
the same two acts 
can be received in completely dichoto-
mous ways depending on gender.

A more subtle yet arguably more 

destructive societal construction that 
distinguishes the sexes is the percep-
tion of personal genitalia. I began 
the article with the discrepancies 
between reaction to bodily functions 
because it is often much easier to con-
ceive how these differences have been 
constructed by our male-dominant 
culture. However, the general idoliza-
tion of the penis and revulsion of the 
vagina begins at an early age and car-
ries all the way into adulthood.

Often, when a little boy plays with 

his penis, he is “adjusting it.” When a 
little girl touches her vagina, nearby 
adults laugh in discomfort and scold 
her to stop. Boys in middle school draw 
penises all over the walls and on each 
other’s faces. Girls in middle school 
pretend vaginas don’t exist. Kids in 
high school join the “pen15” club. Girls 
in high school don’t even learn about 
the clitoris in basic sexed.

When you or a woman you know 

first experienced her period, was it 
a moment of acceptance and peace, 
or was it a weird secret that people 
around her whispered about? Was 
putting in a tampon the first time you 
explored your own vagina? Was it the 
first time you felt acceptable doing so?

We are taught to be disgusted by 

the blood coming out of our bodies. 
We are told to hide our tampons on 
the way to the bathroom so passersbys 
won’t dare know we have to stick cot-
ton up our canals to absorb the blood. 
We are taught to shame girls who are 
experiencing that time of the month 
by asking if their emotions are being 
influenced by PMS.

We are taught that we must stick 

a plastic applicator up our vaginas to 
insert a dry piece of cotton into our 
vaginal canals so that we don’t have to 
touch anything that might be “gross.”

Well, here’s the truth: your body is not 

gross. It is natural and real. Your vagina 
is not a secret. If boys can draw penises 
on the walls, we can create vagina sculp-
tures to display in the art school.

It’s time for a revolution, and the 

revolution has arrived — DivaCups, 
MoonCups, Ruby Cups. They’re all the 
same, and they’re here to stay. Men-
strual cups are a blood-catchment 
system that is inserted into the vagina 
and rests below the cervix. A person 
simply empties the cup of blood into 
the toilet when it is full, and boils the 
cup at the end of her cycle. The cup can 
be reused for up to 10 years.

Why is this so amazing? First of all, 

menstrual cups are much healthier for 
your body. They don’t have chemicals 
or perfumes, they avoid dryness by 
catching your menstrual flow rather 
than absorbing it, and there is no risk 

for toxic shock syndrome because they 
are made out of 100 percent medi-
cal silicone. Plastics and chemicals in 
pads and tampons can cause unwant-
ed problems. The cup can be worn for 
up to 12 hours, and therefore allows for 
much more constant physical activity 
and traveling comfort.

Secondly, the cost savings with diva 

cups are incredible. In one year if you 
spend around $100 on tampons, then 
in 10 years you are saving $1000 (some 
simple math)!

Third, landfills are benefitting so 

much from the menstrual cup revolu-
tion. In one woman’s lifetime, she will 
use around 12,000 tampons or pads, 
all of which (hopefully) end up in 
landfills. Ruby-cup.com estimates that 
about four diva cups in one’s lifetime 
can equate to about 12,000 tampons. 
They also report that about 170,000 
plastic tampon applicators are found 
along U.S. coastlines in a single year, 
each of which takes about 500 years to 
break down.

Ruby Cup is a special brand of men-

strual cup that works a bit like TOMS 
Shoes: buy one, give one to a schoolgirl 
in a developing country. This means 
that she has more flexibility to go to 
school all year round, stay healthy and 
contribute to her society. Girl by girl, 
we can change the world.

The menstrual cup revolution can 

remodel our relationships with our 
vaginas, our blood, our earth and, 
most importantly, ourselves. We are 
reclaiming our rights to our bod-
ies and our blood. The cup may seem 
small, but it’s changing the flow.

L

ast Friday, U.S. Supreme 
Court Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg answered ques-

tions from com-
mentators 
at 

Hill 
Auditorium 

during the Uni-
versity’s 
annual 

Tanner 
Lecture 

on Human Val-
ues. The audito-
rium was packed 
to capacity, with 
thousands 
of 

political 
nerds 

drooling in their 
seats simply for 
getting the chance to lay eyes on the 
“Notorious R.B.G.”

R.B.G. 
has 
been 
celebrated 

across the country for the past few 
decades as a monumental leader 
in the women’s rights movement. 
Her popularity has been elevated 
to that of a classic cultural icon 
among America’s youth. Affection-
ately nicknamed Notorious R.B.G. 
(a moniker inspired by deceased 
rapper Notorious B.I.G.), Ginsburg 
has entered the minds and hearts 
of thousands of young nerds across 
the nation, becoming an iconic 
leader in the battle for equality 
among all human beings.

During the lecture, Ginsburg 

spoke about several topics including 
law, women’s rights, professional-
ism, famous SCOTUS cases and giv-
ing advice how to best help others.

With all eyes glued to her small, 

shockingly 
fashionable 
81-year-

old frame, Ginsburg noted, “If you 
think of yourself as a professional, 
well you’re not just going to get a 
job so you can turn over a buck … 
You’ve got a skill, and you can earn 
a living from it. But if you think 
of yourself as a true professional 
armed with a skill, you could help 
someone who is less fortunate.”

Even before Ginsburg began work-

ing in the public sphere, she embod-
ied this sentiment. When she began 
law school in 1956, she was one of 
nine women in her class of over 500 
students. She graduated at the top 
of her class in 1959 from Columbia 

Law School after attending Harvard 
Law for her first two years. However, 
gaining employment after excelling 
in law school was nearly impossible 
for our beloved idol. Ginsburg men-
tioned during her speech that there 
“weren’t many legal employers who 
were willing to take on a woman.”

R.B.G. was eventually offered 

a position as a law clerk. After her 
initial struggle in the workforce, 
Ginsburg steadily built an admirable 
career as a law professional and an 
advocate for human rights — specifi-
cally gender rights.

Her list of accomplishments is 

almost unnerving. She taught at the 
Rutgers University Law School. She 
became the director for the Ameri-
can Civil Liberties Union’s Wom-
en’s Rights Project, winning five of 
the six cases she argued before the 
Supreme Court. She was the first 
tenured female professor at Colum-
bia Law School. She was appointed 
to the District of Columbia’s U.S. 
Court of Appeals by President 
Jimmy Carter and wrote more than 
300 opinions for the court. And in 
1993 — the year I was born — Presi-
dent Bill Clinton nominated Gins-
burg to replace SCOTUS Justice 
Byron White. After her confirma-
tion, she became the second female 
justice in our nation’s history.

R.B.G.’s 
popularity 
began 
to 

increase after her ferocious dissents 
in the affirmative action case, Fisher 
v. University of Texas at Austin, and 
the voting rights case, Shelby County 
v. Holder. When alternatives to affir-
mative action were offered during 
oral arguments, Ginsburg famously 
responded in her dissent with, “only 
an ostrich could regard the suppos-
edly race-neutral alternatives as 
race-unconscious.”

Shortly after the dissents were 

released in June 2014, New York Uni-
versity law student Shana Knizhnik 
created the “Notorious R.B.G.” tum-
blr, propelling Ginsburg to Internet 
immortality among America’s young, 
tech-savvy demographic.

The creation of this tumblr 

turned into something devoted 
R.B.G. fanatics have only dreamed 

about since 1993. A Jan. 6 post from 
the site summarizes this notion 
and Ginsburg’s year in two simple 
sentences (emphasis mine): “This 
year, the Notorious R.B.G. had 
heart surgery, celebrated her 81st 
birthday, and served her 21st year 
on the Supreme Court of the United 
States. But most of all, 2014 was the 
year that everyone realized that she 
is a total badass.”

In 2003, only nine percent of 

respondents in a poll by FindLaw.
com were able to identify Ginsburg 
as a Supreme Court justice; in 2012, 
that number increased to 13 per-
cent. It’s safe to say that in 2015, 
more Americans (especially more 
young Americans) are able to iden-
tify R.B.G. as a Supreme Court jus-
tice and a passionate advocate for 
human rights.

But is it really accurate to deem 

Ginsburg “notorious?”

According to Merriam-Webster 

online, the definition of notorious 
is “generally known and talked of; 
especially: widely and unfavorably 
known.”

Oxford dictionary online has a 

similar definition for notorious: 
“famous or well known, typically for 
some bad quality or deed.”

The nickname “Notorious R.B.G.” 

is funny, amusing and clever, yet, 
it’s not actually a good description 
of Ginsburg, her work or her ideol-
ogy. While Ginsburg dissenters may 
deem her “notorious” for her liberal 
beliefs about human rights, in my 
book she is anything but.

Ginsburg is renowned, esteemed, 

illustrious, 
astounding, 
influen-

tial, preeminent — but she is never, 
 

ever notorious.

In everything she has done, Gins-

burg has worked for the betterment 
of humankind. She is an incred-
ible person, and I can only hope to 
accomplish a mere sliver of the good 
that she has done in the world.

For now, I will follow Ginsburg’s 

parting advice: “Pursue — whatever 
it is — your passion.”

Investing in your future

O

ur country’s income inequality is sim-
ply colossal. The top three percent of 
wealthy families own 54 percent of 

our wealth. The top 10 per-
cent owns 85 percent of our 
wealth. This unequal dis-
tribution has been growing 
since the late 1990s.

We can all agree that 

income inequality sucks, but 
that isn’t going to get us any-
where. We need to talk about 
initiatives that each of us can 
begin to help bridge the gap 
between the wealthy and the 
rest of us.

While a variety of fac-

tors meld together to create a person’s wealth, 
one of the most influential and unused tactics 
involves good stock investment. The wealthi-
est 10 percent own 81 to 94 percent of financial 
assets — stocks being one of them.

I’m sure you’ve heard that investing in 

stocks is a wise decision, but not until you 
understand the mechanics behind compound-
ing interest do you realize how crucial invest-
ment in your 20s can be.

To make sure we’re all on the same page 

with definitions, interest is the amount of 
money you receive for letting someone bor-
row your money. A lot of financial institutions 
provide interest — including stocks, bonds and 
banks. Let’s take banks as an example. If you 
put your money in a bank, you’re doing them a 
favor by giving them money. They actually use 
this money to invest in other projects to make 
money. To reward you, they provide compen-
sation by depositing a fraction of your account 
holdings. This compensation is the interest 
that is added into your account.

However, not all financial institutions pro-

vide the same interest rates, and some institu-
tions provide interest that’s pitifully low. Banks, 
for example, have historically only provided a 
0.17 percentage annual average. That means 
you’d only make 17 cents per year for every $100 
you have deposited in the bank.

Stock averages are much greater. Though 

the stock market is extremely volatile, it aver-
ages a six to seven percent interest rate per 
year. This is the highest average return of all 
forms of investment.

It’s in this percentage change that you could 

become a millionaire while depositing around 
one-tenth of that money.

The key lies in the idea of compounding 

interest for long periods of time. Compound-
ing interest is similar to the idea of regular 
interest except that your interest accrues 
interest in the next year. Let’s use stock 
returns to elaborate on this. Say that you 
invest in a stock that costs $100 and, with 
interest, it increases by the average seven per-
cent to $107. Then, if your stock rises by seven 
percent in the following year, it’ll be worth 
$114.49. Notice that the increase in the price 

was 49 cents more than the first year. That’s 
due to the fact that the seven percent interest 
in the second period applied the seven-dollar 
increase in the first period.

Now, this may not seem like a significant 

amount of money, but over decades of time, it 
is. If at age 20 you invested $1,000 in a stock, 
it grew by the average compound interest rate, 
and you took the money out when you were 
50 years old, you would have $7,612.26. If you 
pulled it out at age 60, you would have almost 
$15,000. That’s almost 15 times the amount of 
money you originally invested.

Let’s make it clear that this isn’t a get-rich-

quick scheme. Compound interest requires 
decades of time to invest, but think of how 
revolutionary this could be for people with 
low income.

Saving $1,000 in a year only requires putting 

$83.33 away each month. That can be difficult 
for those living on a low yearly income, but it’s 
possible for almost anyone.

If you saved $1,000 every year in your 20s 

and 30s, you’re estimated to end up retiring 
in your 60s with slightly more than a quarter-
million dollars. And if you want to invest more 
money, you have the ability to retire with even 
more money.

Having this nest egg leads to an infinite 

amount of possibilities. You could allow the 
stocks to continue gaining value each year 
and sell off the extra value, allowing your-
self a multi-thousand dollar endowment each 
year. You can use the money as a retirement 
account to have a financially sound retire-
ment. You can will your children some of the 
money and allow them to spend what they 
want and invest the rest.

Now, this process isn’t as easy as picking a 

stock and waiting 40 years. The stock market is 
extremely volatile, and investing in bad stocks 
could lead to you losing a lot of money. If you’re 
going to invest, you need to put a lot of time 
into understanding the process and identifying 
valuable stocks.

But the time is worth it. It’s the way for 

the single mother putting $50 in her savings 
account to take control of her and her child’s 
financial future. It’s how the 20-year-old flip-
ping burgers at McDonald’s has a chance at a 
secure future.

So go on Amazon and buy a highly regarded 

beginner’s investment book. Take advantage of 
online websites dedicated to helping investors. 
Ask friends for advice on getting into invest-
ment, and tell other friends about the power of 
compound interest. Research companies until 
you find ones you want to invest in. Invest, 
invest, invest.

Don’t avoid the stock market because you 

don’t know much about it. Though it’s not an 
immediate remedy for poverty, it’s the system 
that can diminish it.

Reconsider the honor code 
 
 

TO THE DAILY: 

I graduated from this University in 1995, 

and during my years on this campus, the stu-
dent body protested the implementation of 
the Statement of Student Rights and Respon-
sibilities (SSRR), which the administration 
had introduced via a mass mailing to students 
in the spring of 1992. Of those students who 
voted in the November 1992 Michigan Student 
Assembly elections, 86 percent voted against 
the SSRR; sadly, the Regents implemented it 
the very day after those elections.

Monday’s announcement by Central Stu-

dent Government about creating task force to 
look into drafting an “honor code” to supple-
ment the SSRR surprised me. Now, as I did 
then, I have to ask, “Why?” Aren’t there local 
and state laws against what the fraternities and 
sororities in question did? Don’t they have gov-
ernments (the Interfraternity Council for fra-

ternities and the Panhellenic Association for 
sororities)? Don’t those fraternities and sorori-
ties themselves already have honor codes that 
apply to all chapters across the country? And 
why are University student leaders interested 
in the very sort of “in loco parentis” utopian 
stuff that their early-1990s Michigan Student 
Assembly counterparts were fighting and vot-
ing against?

I am well aware that students at this Univer-

sity, as at other colleges and universities world-
wide, are at this crossroads. They are adults, 
but at the same time, they are just beginning 
to learn about life in the real world. However, 
there are already laws in place for those who 
do not behave responsibly. Therefore, I implore 
CSG’s leadership to reconsider their decision to 
look into creating yet another “honor code.”

So 
you’re 
alone 

on 
Valentine’s 
Day. 

Maybe you’ve just gone 

through a breakup, maybe 
you’re perpetually single 
or maybe you have the mu-
tant cold currently trav-
elling through the dorms 
and everyone refuses to 
get 
anywhere 
close 
to 

you, let alone touch you.

But the college student’s 

best friend, TV, is here to 
comfort you and drown out 
the noises of your neighbor 
and her boyfriend who got 
inspired by the premiere 
of “Fifty Shades of Grey.” 

So, in keeping with the 

theme of love and com-
memoration of the day 
St. Valentine was mar-
tyred and buried in Ita-
ly, here are the episodes 
you should watch while 
you’re not getting laid:

“30 Rock”

Anna Howard Shaw Day

To elude the pressures of 

Valentine’s Day, Liz (Tina 
Fey) schedules a root canal, 
forgetting that she needs 
someone to drive her home.

Watch if: You want to pic-

ture all your ex’s lined up in 
dental hygienist uniforms.

“Parks and Recreation”

Operation Ann

Leslie 
(Amy 
Poehler) 

tries to find love for her 
best friend, Ann (Rashida 
Jones), by enlisting her 
co-workers to bring blind 
dates to the department’s 
Valentine’s 
Day 
dance. 

The real star of the epi-

sode is the recently bro-
ken-up-with 
Chris 
(Rob 

Lowe), the morbid DJ of 
the event who continu-
ously tells a room full of 
couples that love is fleeting.

Watch if: Seeing Ron 

Swanson get excited by 
puzzles will get you out 
of your break-up funk.

“Buffy the Vampire 

Slayer”

Bewitched, Bothered, and 

Bewildered

Xander (Nicholas Bren-

don) decides to get back at 
Cordelia (Charisma Car-
penter) for breaking up 
with him by casting a love 
spell on her. However, this 
plan goes terribly awry 
when every girl in Sunny-
dale except Cordelia falls 
madly in love with him.

Watch if: You’ve been 

considering the dark arts 
as a source of revenge. 
Trust me, it’s not worth it.

FILE PHOTO/Daily

“Orange is the New Black”

You Also Have a Pizza

This episode focuses 

on the loves of Litchfield, 
which will both warm 
and break your icy heart. 
As always, the rest of the 
cast has very different 
opinions on love and Val-
entine’s Day. There is a 

sex contest, betrayal and 
the description of love as 
intense pain. You might 
cry when Suzanne looks 
at Morella with those cra-
zy eyes and says “I know 
something about loving 
people who aren’t smart 
enough to be loved back. 

I learned a secret that 

I can tell you. They don’t 
deserve it.” For all the 

eye rolling over Valen-
tine’s Day, the inmates at 
Litchfield still need any 
kind of love they can get.

Watch if: Even after 

everything 
that’s 
hap-

pened, you still want to 
believe in all this stuff. 

When 
Crazy 
Eyes 

tells 
you 
that 
that’s 

brave, 
you 
won’t 
feel 

quite so alone anymore.

Why Valentine’s Day 
rocked in grade school

By CARLY NOAH

Weekend Roundup Contributor

You were guaranteed 
a heap of valentines by 

placing a shoebox on your 

desk

Back in the day, you re-

ceived many Valentine’s Day 

well-wishes sim-
ply by making a 
cardboard 
mail-

box. You didn’t 
have 
to 
worry 

about graciously accepting a 
gift you weren’t crazy about 
(read: boxes of raisins) be-
cause gifts could be given 
anonymously. Also, you left 
Valentine’s Day with a pile of 
free candy and adorable cards.

It wasn’t hard 
work, either.

The giving pro-

cess wasn’t very 
difficult. All you had to do 
was head to your local dol-
lar store and buy a pack of 
festive CatDog- or Sponge-
Bob-themed cards. After 
signing your name on them, 
you were free to accept the 
rewards for your hard work.

To sign “From” or “Love” 
was the hardest decision 

you had to make. 

With that being said, 

it could get tricky when 

it came how you wanted 
to sign your name. From 
personal 
experience, 
I 

usually 
reserved 
“Love” 

for 
my 
closest 
friends, 

and if I was feeling par-
ticularly brave, a member 
of the opposite gender.

And of course, the food 

(read: FREE food). 

Valentine’s Day 

class parties used 
to be a huge deal. 
Cupcakes, 
cook-

ies, chocolate, punch and 
candy hearts were gener-
ously provided by the moth-
ers of kids in your class. A 
heart-shaped paper plate 
filled to the brim with sug-
ary treats, accompanied by 
a plastic cup of red punch, 
was the best part of Val-
entine’s Day celebrations.

Today, the story has 

changed. You’re responsi-
ble for selecting a cute and 
funny — but still personal 
and meaningful — present 
for your significant other. 
You’re also tasked with 
picking the perfect outfit, 
restaurant and ambience 
to celebrate the holiday. 
Or, there is the alterna-
tive problem: no plans. 

When you find your-

self saddened or stressed, 
remember 
the 
glo-

ry 
days 
of 
elementary 

school 
Valentine’s 
Day.

Michigan coach Red Berenson has been impressed with the quality of Big Ten hockey, despite the conference’s struggles.
Wolverines maintain 
hope for conference

By JEREMY SUMMITT

Daily Sports Editor

For the old diehards of the 

Central 
Collegiate 
Hockey 

Association, this year might be as 
good as any to wish for its return, 
even if only as a replacement for a 
lackluster Big Ten season.

It isn’t the drama and intensity 

that has held back the Big Ten, 
but rather its teams’ combined 
poor showings in non-conference 
games paired with plenty of 
inconsistency that has kept it 
in the lower echelon of college 
hockey leagues.

Even with what has been 

a 
season 
of 
underachieving 

for many Big Ten teams, the 
spectacle of Big Ten hockey 
hasn’t faded for Michigan coach 
Red Berenson.

“I just think it’s a new level,” he 

said. “I can’t tell you all the teams 
are better than the teams in the 
CCHA, but the venues are. And 
it just seems like it’s a big-league 
environment, so that’s what I like 
about the Big Ten.”

Berenson might be a man of 

few complaints this year, as his 
12th-ranked 
Wolverines 
and 

No. 19 Penn State hold the top 
two spots in the conference 
standings. But even with two 
ranked teams and Minnesota on 
the verge of breaking into the 
national polls, the Big Ten still 
might send only one program to 
the 16-team NCAA Tournament.

“These programs, just because 

they’re in the Big Ten, (it) 
doesn’t give them an automatic 
entitlement to be, you know, a 
top-10 or top-20 (program),” 
Berenson 
said. 
“We 
all 
go 

through cycles.”

Wisconsin has been stuck in 

an infinite loop of disastrous 
proportions this year, winning 
just two games — the fewest 
of any team in the country. 
Ohio State has been plagued by 
injuries, Michigan State is just 
now starting to find a groove 
with a month left in the season, 
and Minnesota had been in a two-
month slump before sweeping 
the Buckeyes last weekend.

“Minnesota is better than 

their record,” Berenson said. 
“They’re going to surface, they’re 
going to be there, and we’re 
hoping to be there. And we’ll see 
if Ohio State and Michigan State 
get something going. It could be 
a down year, but wait until it’s 
over.”

In the meantime, it’s best to sit 

back and enjoy the ride.

“We just have really good 

programs, really good recruiters, 
really good coaching, and it’s a 
really 
good 

league,” 
said 

senior forward 
Zach Hyman.

When 
the 

CCHA 
still 

existed, games 
were 
rarely 

televised. 
Now, the Big Ten Network 
carries games every weekend 
throughout conference play.

“I think that playing against 

big name schools every night, 
I think that’s huge,” Hyman 
said. “I think Big Ten Network 
is awesome, being on that and 
getting that kind of publicity. We 
didn’t have that in the CCHA.”

Along with publicity come 

new rivalries, too, and those 
rivalries become amplified with 
a larger viewership. Berenson 
and Hyman admitted that the 
games against Miami (Ohio) and 
Notre Dame were notable losses 
that came with Big Ten hockey, 
but those games rarely reached 
the same levels of regional and 
national audiences.

“It’s too bad we don’t play 

those teams,” Berenson said. 
“Now, maybe we will in the 
future in some non-conference 
games, but that’s the way it is.

“In the meantime, we get to 

play Minnesota and Wisconsin 
every year, and Penn State will 
become a rivalry, Ohio State is 
getting better and Michigan 
State is Michigan State, so they’re 
always going to be a rival.”

And 
without 
conference 

realignment, a team like Penn 
State might not have had the 
chance to prove itself on the 
biggest stage. In just their second 
year as a Division I program, the 

Nittany Lions have tripled their 
win total from last year and rank 
22nd out of 59 teams in RPI.

The Big Ten has been a sound 

base for recruiting and has held 
an instrumental role in garnering 
more interest around college 
hockey. Conference expansion 
might not be in the immediate 
future, and the six current 
programs will have to cope with 
a significantly smaller conference 
than the rest of the leagues. But 

the 
Big 
Ten 

region 
offers 

just as much 
opportunity 
for growth.

Nebraska, 

Iowa 
and 

Illinois 
offer 

logical choices 

for expansion opportunities in 
the next decade. All three schools 
currently 
have 
club 
hockey 

programs and reside in regions 
with strong hockey fan bases.

Sure, 
Iowa 
and 
Nebraska 

don’t have NHL franchises, but 
Iowa does boast seven teams in 
the USHL, a recruiting hotbed 
for top programs around the 
country. Michigan sophomore 
defenseman Michael Downing 
was a product of the Dubuque 
Fighting Saints before enrolling 
at Michigan.

Nebraska, 
too, 
has 
three 

USHL 
teams, 
including 
the 

Omaha Lancers, who have a 
league-record seven titles. If they 
became a Division I program, the 
Cornhuskers would have a natural 
rival in Nebraska-Omaha, a team 
enjoying great success this season 
as the No. 4 team in this week’s 
USCHO.com poll.

Much work must to be done 

to bring the Big Ten into the 
realm of the CCHA’s dominance 
throughout its 42-year history. 
Big Ten hockey might never 
reach the prominence of Big Ten 
basketball and football, either. 
It’s a work in progress and stands 
as a reality many hockey fans will 
have to accept.

It’s not hard to tell that Big Ten 

hockey remains in its infancy, but 
don’t sleep on its potential just 
yet.

‘M’ heads to Illinois 
on three-game skid

By DANIEL FELDMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Spike 
Albrecht 
had 
been 

thinking about holding a players-
only meeting. The Michigan 
men’s basketball team’s 72-54 
home 
loss 

to 
Iowa 
last 

week gave him 
the 
perfect 

opportunity.

In addition 

to the junior 
guard, 
senior 

forward 
Max 

Bielfeldt, 
junior 
guard 

Caris 
LeVert, 

sophomore 
guard Derrick 
Walton Jr. and 
sophomore forward Zak Irvin 
each spoke up as well, delivering 
a simple message.

“(Make) sure everyone knows 

the expectations here,” Albrecht 
said. “And don’t fall into that 
trap of (thinking) what we’re 
doing is acceptable.”

With Michigan (6-6 Big Ten, 

13-11 overall) fresh off three 
straight losses and traveling to 
Champaign on Thursday to take 
on Illinois, a lot is on the line. 
Expectations are still high, and 
an NCAA Tournament bid is still 
the goal.

At ninth place in the Big Ten, 

Michigan’s chances of climbing 
back into the top half of the 
standings with six games to go 
in conference play are slim to 
none. Still, Michigan coach John 
Beilein remains hopeful his team 
can make some noise.

“This is a year where you 

could be in the middle of this 
pack and still get into the NCAA 
Tournament, because you look 

nationwide, and also just look at 
our league,” Beilein said. “What I 
love about our opportunity is we 
have the opportunity now with 
Illinois — who we’re fighting 
with somewhere in that pack 
— Michigan State, Ohio State. 
All (are) opportunities that you 
wouldn’t get at another level to 
really increase our résumé if 
we’re going to have any chance 
at the postseason.”

The focus of Wednesday’s 

practice was Illinois (6-5, 16-8), 
which is led by guards Malcolm 
Hill and Kendrick Nunn. In the 
last nine games, Hill and Nunn 
have accounted for 52.9 percent of 
the Illini’s scoring. The purpose 
of Tuesday’s 
practice, 
though, 
was for the 
Wolverines 
to 
improve 

on 
the 

basics, 
even 

if 
it 
meant 

practicing 
drills usually 
reserved for September, like ball-
handling drills.

“We’ve got to keep working, 

but at the same time, if you saw 
(Tuesday’s) practice it was about 
catching on two feet,” Beilein 
said. “You can do all the game 
planning you want for Illinois, 
but if we still drop a two-on-
one fast break and bobble it, it 
doesn’t work.”

Michigan could have been 

in a different position if a 
couple of possessions had gone 
differently in recent games. 
According to Bielfeldt, despite 
mental 
mistakes 
from 
the 

younger players and injuries to 
LeVert and Walton, expectations 
remain just as high for the 

Wolverines. And the NIT is not 
part of such plans.

Whether Michigan eventually 

makes the NCAA Tournament 
or the NIT, one priority will stay 
constant for the Wolverines: 
improve every day and take it 
game by game.

“That’s the most important 

thing right now,” Albrecht said. 
“It’s 
just 
making 
Michigan 

better. … We’ve got to work out 
some kinks, and as we continue 
to develop and figure that out, 
we can look more into other 
teams and their tendencies.”

While the next couple games 

will reveal if Michigan has 
even the slightest chance for an 

at-large 
bid 

to the NCAA 
Tournament, 
there 
are 

other 
implications 
as well.

“It’s 

important 
that we see 
this part of 

the future,” Beilein said. “I’m 
looking so forward to that, but in 
the meantime, I’m not giving up 
on today.”

NOTES: Beilein said Walton 

has “been getting every day, but 
certainly (is) not ready yet” to 
return to action. His hope is for 
the sophomore to come back 
before the season ends, but he 
does not have a timetable.

“When he can run pain-free, 

he’s going to get back out there,” 
Beilein said. “Now obviously 
there’s some rehab involved for 
him to get his cardio back up — 
he can’t do that yet, but when 
he can, I would say two to three 
days later we would put him in a 
game.”

Michigan in the final countdown

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Writer

It has become a rocky road 

for 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team.

Two 
weeks 
ago, 
the 

Wolverines (6-7 Big Ten, 14-10 
overall) lost to both Nebraska 
and No. 5 Maryland. Then, last 
Thursday, Michigan narrowly 
defeated Michigan State despite 
allowing the Spartans to trim a 
22-point lead to six.

Sunday, against then-No. 21 

Rutgers, the Wolverines almost 
grabbed their second lead of the 
game with 3:10 left, when senior 
guard Shannon Smith pushed 
through three defenders under 
the basket, made a layup and 
narrowed the deficit to two. But 
even a nearly impossible play by 
a 5-foot-7 guard wasn’t enough 
to ignite Michigan to an upset.

Two days later in Columbus, 

Smith continued to spearhead 
the offense. With a layup, she 
topped off a 13-point lead over 
the Buckeyes for the Wolverines’ 
largest of the night, but they 
squandered that cushion in the 
final nine minutes, ultimately 
losing by four points.

Michigan 
has 
just 
five 

opponents to face before Big 
Ten Tournament — three below 
the Wolverines in the standings 
and one that they have already 
defeated once this year. But 
even then, a lot is coming into 
question.

It’s 
hard 
to 
say 
which 

Michigan squad will show up 
on any given night. It’s hard to 
say if the Wolverines’ lights-
out shooters will be lights-out. 
It’s hard to say if this team’s 
defense can hold steady and not 
allow two different players on 
two different teams to score 19 
second-half points.

And given the inconsistencies, 

it’s hard to say if Michigan will 
reach the NCAA Tournament. 
With a question mark hovering 
over the Wolverines’ postseason, 
the Daily breaks down this year’s 
team as it approaches the end of 
the regular season.

THE 
FULL 
40: 
Though 

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico has stressed to her team 
that it needs to put together a 

full 40 minutes of basketball, the 
Wolverines haven’t done so in 
their past two games.

Michigan ran out of gas when 

it nearly upset Rutgers and held a 
large lead over Ohio State before 
giving it away. Winning one or 
two of those would have been a 
much-needed résumé booster. 
Instead, the Wolverines let both 
teams stomp on them as their 
defense shut down, and allowed 
Buckeye guard Kelsey Mitchell 
to score 26 total points.

The defense is going to need 

to better pinpoint and eliminate 
the main scoring threats before 
it’s too late. Michigan will also 
need to fight past the fatigue 
with time winding down and its 
season on the line.

DOWNTOWN SHOOTING: 

At the beginning of the season, 
Barnes Arico said freshman 
guard 
Katelynn 
Flaherty 

doesn’t play like a freshman. But 
recently, she has started look 
like one.

In the last two games, Flaherty 

has gone a combined 6-for-28, 
with only one 3-pointer, missing 
all of her open looks against 
Rutgers. Meanwhile, sophomore 
guard Siera Thompson hasn’t 
been able to make up for the loss 
in scoring, as she too has been on 
a cold streak, going 7-for-31 in 
the last two games.

Though 
Flaherty 
and 

Thompson combined for 21 
points from beyond the arc 
against Michigan State, they 
have gone downhill since. For 
Michigan to win out, it’s going 
to need its best shooters to be 
efficient from long range.

THE 
BOARD 
GAME: 

Though the Wolverines shot 
26.2 percent against the Scarlet 
Knights, 
double-digit 
leads 

were hard to come by as a result 
of Michigan’s efforts on the 
glass.

Senior 
forwards 
Cyesha 

Goree 
and 
Nicole 
Elmblad 

have 
been 
getting 
batted 

around in the paint, but they’ve 
been 
important 
contributors 

nonetheless. Elmblad posted her 
second double-double (14 points, 
15 rebounds) against Ohio State 
alongside Goree’s 14 boards.

Elmblad’s 
aggressiveness 

allows her to draw fouls often, 
and Goree’s toughness fares well 
against almost any matchup. If 
both can stay out of foul trouble 
late in the game, they will 
continue to be the staples for a 
team trying to keep its NCAA 
Tournament dream alive.

HOT OFF THE BENCH: 

While some of Michigan’s better 
players have had to come off the 
court due to foul trouble, Barnes 
Arico has been getting a lot of 
production from her bench.

Freshman 
forward 
Jillian 

Dunston has played 30 minutes 
in the last two games, collecting 
12 total rebounds. She played a 
big role against Rutgers, filling 
in for Goree, who had to leave 
the game with four fouls.

Against Ohio State, junior 

guard 
Madison 
Ristovski 

replaced 
sophomore 
guard 

Danielle Williams, who has been 
scoreless in four of her last five 
starts. Ristovski finished with 
five points against the Buckeyes, 
including one triple.

If necessary, Barnes Arico has 

efficient options to fall back on.

ROBERT DUNNE/Daily

Katelynn Flaherty has gone cold from 3-point range in the past two games.

“I just think it’s 

a new level.”

Unable to reach wider 
audience, Every Three 
Weekly featured in The 
Michigan Daily

 
As students walk through the Diag in the 

middle of the day, they may come across a familiar 
scene of two or three figures holding newspapers. 
The figures are saying something, and as you get 
closer, you begin to make out their voices, shouting 
“Every Three Weekly!”
 
Some students ignore them and walk right 

by. Others approach them and take a copy — they’ve 
eagerly awaited the newest edition of the Univer-
sity’s student-run newspaper that specializes ex-
clusively in humor and satire. They chuckle at the 
clever headlines and stuff the newspaper in their 
backpacks, looking forward to reading the full ar-
ticles after class. Regardless of how the students on 
the Diag respond, the Every Three Weekly staffers 
never complain as they stand in the sometimes blis-
tering cold, presenting the beautiful copy they’ve 
been working so hard on for three weeks.
 
No other University publication makes use of 

such a direct method of distribution — one way the 

Every Three Weekly separates itself from the pack.
 
“We like to have this opportunity to interact 

with our readers,” said the E3W’s Editor in Chief, 
LSA junior Marie Michels, when asked why they 
used this method. “It’s a time when we can talk to 
them face to face. We can often tell jokes as we’re 
passing out the issue, which is exciting.”
 
This personal method of distribution is 

smart, as many students may not have the time or 
energy to seek out copies on their own. And, ulti-
mately, it is a testament to the Every Three Weekly 
staff’s pride in their work.
 
“After we’ve spent three weeks putting to-

gether an issue, we’re so excited about the content 
we’ve produced, and we’ve worked so hard to put it 
all together,” Michels said.
 
The Every Three Weekly was founded in 

1997 by a group of students in the College of Engi-
neering who hoped to create a medium for humor 
about life at the University. Inspired by The Onion, 
the newspaper format is easily digestible for read-
ers. But learning to write in that style requires a bit 
of a learning curve.

“You can’t just write some-

thing 
that’s 
funny,” 
said 

Engineering freshman Peter 
Flanagan, 
a 
recently 
hired 

E3W writer. “You have to write 
something that’s funny and fits 
the guidelines of a standardized 
paper, so we’re actually parody-
ing something. It’s difficult in 
that regard, getting used to it, 
but all the editors are really tal-
ented, so they all know how to 
reformat a joke to fit the guide-
lines, so they’re really helpful to 
new writers.”

The combination of humor 

and a standardized format is an 
ideal one for students for whom 
writing is usually not one of 
their favorite activities.

“It’s a good experience,” Fla-

nagan said. “Engineers have to 
take a couple of English classes, 
so might as well get it in a club, 
too.”

While 
the 
Every 
Three 

Weekly does have a distin-
guished and recognizable style, 
it’s not immune to innovation. 
The publication is constantly 
trying to think of other ways to 
reach out to students and gain 
new readers. In addition to pub-
lishing its articles on a website, 
the paper has recently unveiled 
The Click House, a section of 
the website that satirizes online 
click-bait articles, similar to 
The Onion’s ClickHole.

“(New formats for the Every 

Three Weekly) are still up in the 
air and being debated,” Flana-
gan said. “With any form of web 
content, there’s also the oppor-
tunity to create videos, which 
is vastly out of our realm and 
scope right now. But it’s been 
talked about, because there’s a 
lot of joke opportunities to be 
made there.”

The writing process at the 

Every Three Weekly begins 
with a meeting between the 
writers and editors where they 
pitch concepts for articles.

“We all just bring ideas to the 

table,” said Flanagan, describ-
ing the writing process. “We all 
listen to each other’s ideas, and 
we all vote on which ones are 
good.”

Verbally pitching ideas is 

essential in to determine which 
ideas seem to work the best.

“It’s just which one gets the 

most laughs,” Flanagan said. A 
week later, the writers and edi-
tors meet to edit the articles. 
The paper does not publish 
every article the writers pres-
ent to them, both due to the 
paper’s insistence on quality 
and the physical limitations of 
the newspaper format.

“I’ve submitted two (arti-

cles),” said Flanagan. “I feel like 
both of them have an OK shot of 
getting in the paper.”

Any given issue of the Every 

Three Weekly brings a variety 
of laughter, from the “Oh yeah, 
that’s something silly that I can 
relate to,” chuckle to the “I can’t 
believe I just read that!” guffaw. 
Topics range from personal 
relationships 
and 
fraternity 

antics to serious social issues 
such as Ebola and the Keystone 
XL pipeline. Given the publica-
tion’s predilection for subver-
sive humor and controversial 
topics, one might wonder if 
there are any topics the Every 
Three 
Weekly 
won’t 
write 

about. The answer is yes.

“We’ll never approach rape 

jokes, under any circumstanc-
es,” Michels said.

But humor based on race and 

political issues is fair game, 
with a condition.

“We try to always make sure 

that the joke is pointed at the 
system of oppression and not 
the victims of oppression,” 
Michels said.

A recent example of that 

tenet is the article “Unarmed 
white teen gets brutally slapped 
on wrist,” which was written in 
response to the Michael Brown 
shooting and subsequent con-
troversy.

“We wanted to make a joke 

on something as newsworthy as 
these murders,” said Michels, 
“but we knew that under no 
circumstances could we alien-
ate the victims. So instead we 
pointed the joke at this oppres-
sive system and the controversy 
surrounding it.”

By setting up a fictional sce-

nario and writing about it in a 
mock-outraged tone, the Every 
Three Weekly managed to use 
humor to deliver their com-
mentary on a tragic, controver-
sial event and draw attention to 
the absurdity of the situation. 
The publication is dedicated to 
insightful political commentary 
in addition to laughs.

Not everybody appreciates 

the joke, however, which has led 
to moments of controversy for 
the publication throughout the 
years. In 2005, the paper pub-
lished an article titled “Phelps 
to major in pussy,” which led 
to an associate athletic direc-
tor appealing to the Univer-
sity Activities Center executive 
board to limit the newspaper’s 
funding. Briarwood Mall took 
objection to the paper when 
it accidentally referenced the 
mall by name in an article about 
a pedophilic Santa, titled “Mall 
Santa tells child exactly what 
he wants for Christmas.” The 
paper was repeatedly protect-
ed from censorship by various 
Supreme Court precedents and 
University initiatives.

While satire can be protect-

ed on paper and through laws, 
there are some things that can-
not be protected against, as 
made terrifyingly plain after 
the Charlie Hebdo attack in 
France. As proponents and 
practitioners of satire, the 
Every Three Weekly staffers 
were shocked and saddened.

“In 
our 
meetings, 
we’re 

constantly laughing,” Michels 
said. “We’re constantly joking 
about things that, honestly, we 
shouldn’t be joking about. In all 
of our discussions about Charlie 
Hebdo, there wasn’t the usual 
joviality.”

However, this did not slow 

the paper down, and they com-
mitted themselves to paying 
tribute to the victims of the 
attack through humor. The 
result was an infographic titled 
“How satirical newspapers are 
dealing with the Charlie Hebdo 
tragedy.” The infographic per-
fectly captures the paper’s per-
fect mixture of humor, social 
commentary and sense of mor-
als.

The Every Three Weekly’s 

agenda is not a political one, but 
a populist one, seeking to reflect 
the opinions of the student body 
and show there is someone out 
there who understands their 
concerns, while the University 
administration may not. One 
of the paper’s most notable 
achievements in that regard 
occurred beyond the scope of 
the newspaper format.

“We created a fictional can-

didate to run in the CSG elec-
tions,” Michels said. “He won. 
He could not be installed in the 
student government because 
he didn’t exist, but we created 
a little bit of a wave there.”

The candidate for the 2011 

elections was Karlos Marks, 
with Joseph Stallone as a run-
ning mate. Even though the 
fictional candidate couldn’t be 
installed, students saw Karlos 
Marks as a symbol of their dis-
satisfaction with the student 
government, and the numerous 
votes for him were a clear state-
ment of that. Moreover, the stu-

dent support of Karlos Marks 
illustrated the Every Three 
Weekly’s ability to establish a 
meaningful connection with 
University 
students 
through 

its combination of laughs and 
truth.

Above all else, the Every 

Three Weekly represents the 
idea that humor can be a very 
valuable aspect of life.

“My 
favorite 
thing 
that 

humor does is allow us to take 
a second look at the things that 
surround us, the choices we 
make, the ways that we act and 
the cultures we participate in,” 
Michels said. “We can take a 
second look in a way that doesn’t 
startle or offend. It’s a humor-
ous look, and we can challenge 
ourselves and challenge the way 
we perceive things, all while 
sharing this humor that we can 
all really relate to.”

Sharing his perspective on 

the topic, Flanagan described 
the experience of seeing ComCo 
perform in Angell Hall.

“They filled one of the Angell 

Hall rooms, and they were 
charging admission, too,” Fla-
nagan said. “College students 

on a budget, who could do any-
thing else on a Friday night, 
decided to go to ComCo. So 
clearly, University of Michigan 
students value humor.”

“And there are so many dif-

ferent forms of it,” Flanagan 
continued. “The Every Three 
Weekly and ComCo are com-
pletely 
different 
types 
of 

humor. But you go to the source 
that you find to fit yourself bet-
ter, so we’re filling that void if 
you will.”

It is true that there are many 

humor-based 
organizations 

throughout 
the 
University, 

each with its own style. While 
one person may prefer the 
structure of the Every Three 
Weekly, another may be taken 

by the rapid-fire unpredict-
ability of ComCo, the inspired 
weirdness of the Gargoyle or 
the straightforward jokes of 
the LOL ROFL Comedy Club. 
Whatever a student may prefer, 
the Every Three Weekly exists 
to provide its unique version of 
humor, and the writers’ dedica-
tion to their craft has ensured 
that they will remain an insti-
tution for as long as University 
students want a laugh.

Nobody 
can 
predict 
the 

Every Three Weekly’s next 
move, what subjects it will 
tackle and what new formats 
it will explore. But there is 
one thing people can be sure 
of: sometime within the next 
three weeks, another issue of 
the Every Three Weekly will 
be completed, rife with fake 
news and laughter, and the 
staffers will once again set out 
into the Diag to try and get the 
paper in as many hands as pos-
sible.

“We figured just being in 

people’s faces, being loud and 
aggravating is the best way to 
do that,” Michels said with a 
smile.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

The rodeo-centric “Liv-

ing for Love” video features 
Madonna as matador sur-
rounded by a 
flock of bulls, 
however these 
aren’t just any 
kind of bulls. 
They are ripped 
male 
danc-

ers 
rocking 

rhinestoned 
facemasks 
and 
horns. 

Throughout the video she 
is circled by these glamor-
ous horror-film reminiscent 
creatures, 
tempting 
them 

with her cape and fending 
them off with awkward cho-
reography. She rides one in 
typical bull fashion, fights 
one in plank position and 
finally dances in tandem 
with them.

The message here is clear: 

The rhinestone-masked bull-
dancers represent unhealthy 
relationships. 
They 
may 

appear shiny, but in the end 
they are only destructive. 
Madge tempts these relation-
ships and struggles with their 
allure (see her near make-out 
with a horned man). In the 

ends she dances with a group 
minus their masks, embraces 
positive relationships and is 
“gonna carry on” while “liv-
ing for love.”

Great song, but an overly 

stylized video. Several outfit 
changes for a single-scene 
video, well because a Madon-
na video cannot simply have 
one or two outfits. The red 
and black tones work in the 
first half of the video, but they 
eventually digress into some-
thing similar to an Instagram 
filter everyone avoids.

Upon defeating the final 

bull-dancer, roses fall to the 

ground and Madge throws 
her cape. The video closes 
with a Friedrich Nietzsche 
quote: “Man is the cruelest 
animal. At tragedies, bull-
fights and crucifixions he has 
felt best on earth; and when 
he invented hell for himself 
that was his very heaven.”

Ultimately, the video takes 

what is a phenomenal, uplift-
ing song, twists it around and 
shoves it into a metaphorical 
box. Consequently, the song 
loses much of its original 
glory by the video’s attempts 
to be more than a music video.

EPISODE REVIEW

This 
week’s 
episode 
of 

“Archer” saw the spy gang 
stuck in an elevator on their 
way to an early 
morning meet-
ing. This meant 
that we got one 
of the few times 
in 
the 
series 

where 
all 
of 

the 
principal 

cast with the 
exception 
of 

Malory (Jessica 
Walter, “Arrest-
ed 
Develop-

ment”) were together for the 
entire episode. The idea was 
a novel approach — relying 
on dialogue while maintain-
ing a single setting. Even if it 
wasn’t exactly ground-break-

ing or original, the characters 
brought a flavor and humor 
that was enough to carry the 
episode. 
Particular 
high-

lights were Pam (Amber Nash, 
“Frisky Dingo”) channeling 

Omar from “The Wire” while 
drinking malt liquor early in 
the morning. In short, another 
entertaining installment in the 
excellent espionage comedy.

TRAILER REVIEW

It’s those eyes, those big, 

crazy eyes — when you look 
into them, they don’t so much 
as look back, 
but stare deep 
into the soul. 
You’re 
trans-

fixed, lost in 
an 
abyss. 
It 

doesn’t 
mat-

ter that one of 
them 
might 

be lazy, or they often appear 
puffy; rather, it’s what the 
eyes, those big Buscemi eyes 
stand for. They’re the eyes 
of a man who knows what 
he wants, who thinks big, 
who, when he orders coffee, 
demands it be filled no less 
than six times. But how many 
secrets do they hide? How far 
must we wade to get to that 
most base layer, that darkest 
shade of Mr. Buscemi?

It’s most refreshing to see 

a more fleshed out charac-
ter in Mr. Grey, as portrayed 
in supercut by Mr. Buscemi. 
He’s now less a cardboard 
cutout, barely able to stand 
on his own, than a round-
ed character with faults, 
desires, even limits to that 
dark, erotic nature. When the 

going gets rough, he demands 
it stop. This Mr. Grey oozes 
power, maybe not the kind of 
power you were expecting, 
but a greater power all the 
same. Just look into his eyes, 
they’re calling … “Mr. Busce-
mi will see you now.”

Midnight Book Club prepares for a long-form improv performance.
Midnight Book Club 
stays off the script

By ALEX INTNER 

Daily Arts Writer

As the members of the Mid-

night Book Club arrived at Mason 
Hall for one of their biweekly 
rehearsals, they were talking to 
one another about their weekends 
and the day’s snowy weather. As 
one member went to find an open 
room for rehearsal, five others sat 
down around a table to talk to me.

The Midnight Book Club is a 

long-form improv group on cam-
pus that started three years ago by 
“a group of friends who just cared 
about improv and each other,” 
according to Business junior Lau-
ren Barrett. Its style of improv is 
different from what you’d see on 
“Whose Line Is It Anyway” in that 
they use suggestions and ideas to 
build 30- to 40-minute sketches, 
much longer than their short-form 
counterparts.

Barrett went on to describe 

what attending their one-hour, 
free shows is like. “You’d sit in 
a room. And then you’d hear 
‘Uptown Funk.’ And then we’d 
run in and dance. And then 
we’d turn off ‘Uptown Funk’ 
and introduce ourselves. Then 
we’ll take a suggestion from the 
audience that could literally be 
any word. And then we’ll kind 
of do an opening … It can be 
anything we want it to be.”

When doing a show, they always 

take the first word they hear from 
the audience. It leads to com-
pletely different results each time. 
“There’s no scale of goodness on 
suggestion ’cause it’s, if someone is 
like ‘McDonalds,’ it doesn’t neces-
sarily need to be set in McDonalds, 
it’s whatever you take from the 
word,” said LSA sophomore Anna 
Garcia. “So, if it’s like ‘playpen,’ 
‘coke,’ whatever.” She recalled one 
scene they did where the first sug-
gestion was “balls.” Barrett added 
that the suggestions are “more of a 
jumping-off point than a sticking-
to point.”

Music, Theatre and Dance 

junior Graham Techler compared 
improv to playing basketball. Bar-
rett advanced the parallel by say-
ing, “You never know what basket 
you’re gonna shoot. Also, you miss 
100 percent of the shots you don’t 
take.”

They also strongly consider 

their 
relationship 
with 
the 

audience.

“The 
relationship 
between 

audience and improviser is differ-

ent in that it’s not like traditional 
theater 
with 
them 
expecting 

this performance,” Barrett said. 
“They’re part of the creation pro-
cess. They’re watching us create 
this show on our feet. It’s more 
inclusive. They’re let in on an 
inside joke.”

One of the highlights of their 

semester so far has been attending 
the Chicago Open Regional tour-
nament for the second time. They 
competed against teams from all 
over the Midwest, including teams 
from Bowling Green State and 
Grace College.

LSA sophomore Joe Ambrose 

was very impressed by the cali-
ber of schools that were on the 
trip. “There was such a range of 
schools,” he said. “Some kids, like 
us, this is a student org for us, it’s 
an extracurricular … For some, like 
at the Columbia College of Art in 
Chicago, their major was comedy 
and writing. They had a group of 
75 people.”

Garcia continued the subject, 

adding, “They took classes such as 
Improv 101 and they get credit for 
that ... They all have coaches. They 
have someone to ground everyone 
and continuously check in.”

Emily Bice, an LSA and Music, 

Theatre and Dance freshman who 
attended the tournament for the 
first time, was interested in the 
highs and lows of delivering such 
intense performances.

“It was cool to see people who 

were at their peak, well not the 
peak, but who have really finessed 
and worked really hard on improv 
and people who were just learn-
ing. Decide where we fall on that. I 
thought it was an amazing experi-
ence.”

The group has a lot coming up in 

the semester. Garcia said they have 
plans to perform with Michigan 
State University’s ROIAL Players 
in East Lansing. She also men-
tioned that the group is planning 
on increasing their partnership 
with Basement Arts, a student-run 
theater group.

“They have these slots called 

late nights. Basically at 11 p.m. at 
Walgreen Drama Center,” Garcia 
said. “They give you an hour to do 
whatever you want. We’ve done 
a couple of those and they want 
to work closer in partnership, so 
hopefully we’ll be doing more late 
nights.”

Since everything for each show 

is made up, there are a host of 
humorous moments from rehears-

als that never see the light of day. 
Ambrose shared one of his favor-
ite scenes: “(I) had a really fun 
one with Anna where we were at 
the zoo. We were a couple dating. 
It became so real to me that for a 
second I thought there was some 
potential. That was fun. I was like, 
not single for a second.”

Techler added that he liked 

one “when Lauren (Barrett) was 
the mother whose son had fallen 
into the gorilla pit so she had mad 
PTSD.” Barrett continued, “I was 
basically playing Rafiki from ‘Lion 
King.’ I was just shaking.”

Garcia recalled a scene from 

the tournament where Barrett 
was a math teacher about to be 
laid off and lame-duck President 
Riley Taggart was the principal 
laying her off. Barrett discussed 
the scene by saying, “I wanted to 
be this variable in a linear equa-
tion that was greater than zero so 
I was worth something, or even a 
constant, but he thought I was a 
variable that was equal to or less 
than zero and that I needed to go.”

“They were dropping formu-

laic equations … the audience was 
like ‘ah, what?,’ ” Garcia added.

Each member at the table 

clearly enjoys performing in this 
manner, but each enjoys different 
aspects of improvisation. Techler 
started by saying, “What I like 
about improv is trying to find, 
trying to discover what’s going 
on in a group of people without 
getting to debrief on it. Every 
improv scene feels like you’ve 
been caught by police with friend 
and you have to make up a story. 
You have to seem like you’re on 
the same page even when you’re 
not necessarily.”

Garcia spoke to the aspect 

of improv called “group mind”: 
“When we have that on stage, in 
rehearsal, it’s the most incred-
ible feeling, to have your partner 
understand you, know where you 
want to be going (and) support 
you in getting there.”

Bice continued, “I feel like 

college, so much of it is so for-
mulaic … The cool thing about 
improv is for two hours twice 
a week you go and there’s noth-
ing you have to formulate ... You 
get to go big and wild and forget 
about everything you have to 
think about and achieve.”

The Midnight Book Club’s 

next show is Feb. 13 at 8 p.m. at 
the Michigan League Hussey 
Room. Tickets are free.

‘Mockingbird’ sequel 

raises questions 
about authorship

T

he University declar-
ing a snow day last 
Monday. Thoroughly 

enjoying Katy Perry’s halftime 
show (shout out to left shark). 
The return 
of crushed 
velvet 
as an 
acceptable 
material 
to make 
cloth-
ing out 
of. There 
are some 
things in 
life you 
just don’t see coming. And last 
week, the literary community 
was thrown quite a curveball.

Last 
Tuesday, 
it 
was 

announced 
that 
reclusive 

author Harper Lee was going 
to publish her second novel, a 
sort-of sequel to her magnum 
opus, “To Kill a Mockingbird.” 
The new book, titled “Go Set 
a Watchman,” will feature an 
adult Scout and is set to be 
released in July of this year. The 
single-work author of one of the 
greatest novels of American lit-
erature announcing a new book 
after half a century’s worth of 
refusal? Yeah, it’s a big deal.

Most initial reaction to the 

news was, rightfully, stunned 
elation. The fervor, however, 
has slightly cooled over some 
troubling 
allegations, 
name-

ly that Lee, now 88, is being 
exploited by her lawyer and 
publishers.

Lee’s only published novel to 

date, 1960’s “To Kill a Mocking-
bird,” won the Pulitzer Prize, 
and to this day continues to be 
taught in schools around the 
country. The book focuses on 
tomboy Scout Finch, who along 
with her brother Jem and wid-

owed father Atticus, live in the 
small town of Maycomb, Ala-
bama in the 1930s. Atticus, a 
lawyer, is tasked with defend-
ing Tom Robinson, a black 
man accused of raping a white 
woman. The trial and subse-
quent aftermath forces Scout to 
come to terms with the racial 
inequalities of her society, espe-
cially within the justice system.

Like her famous character 

Boo Radley, Harper Lee has 
long been known as something 
of a recluse. Since her initial 
skyrocket to literary fame, Lee 
has refused almost all inter-
views and speaking engage-
ments, and published only a 
few essays in the past 50 years. 
And, up until last week, she had 
never expressed an interest in 
releasing another book.

The timing of “Go Set a 

Watchman” is somewhat puz-
zling. Last year, Lee lost her sis-
ter Alice, who was 103. Alice, a 
lawyer, had staunchly protected 
Lee’s privacy and estate until 
her death. And Harper Lee has 
been in relatively poor health 
since having a stroke in 2007. 
She resides in an assisted living 
home where she is wheelchair 
bound, nearly blind and deaf 
and suffering from memory 
loss.

Attempts to exploit Lee’s 

fragile state have been made 
before. In 2007, Lee signed the 
rights to “To Kill a Mocking-
bird” to a literary agent because 
her eyesight was too weak to 
read the contract. The case was 
settled out of court.

Frustratingly, the only input 

we’ve heard from Lee about 
this new book has always been 
vetted 
through 
her 
lawyer 

and publisher. Even her editor 
admitted that he didn’t think 
anyone spoke directly to Lee.

Lee recently released a pre-

pared statement saying, “I’m 
alive and kicking and happy 
as hell with the reactions to 
Watchman.” And, of course, 
no one should attempt to dis-
credit Lee’s sentiments simply 
because of her age and health 
history. But these statements 
all go through a variety of chan-
nels before they reach the pub-
lic. Lee doesn’t just tweet out 
her thoughts like some authors. 
All her communication with the 
public is vulnerable to manipu-
lation by third parties.

And no one, not lawyers, 

publishers or even Lee herself, 
has come forward to explain 
the why. Why is she deciding to 
publish a novel that was origi-
nally turned down and that she 
has seemingly had no interest 
in releasing until now? Sure, 
people can, and do, change their 
minds all the time. But Lee’s 
entire life has been a study in 
deliberate and vigilant privacy.

The fact of the matter is 

many people stand to make 
a lot of money off “Go Set a 
Watchman.” And people often 
do horrible things, including 
exploiting the elderly, in pursuit 
of a windfall.

Whether “Go Set a Watch-

man” lives up to the literary 
prowess of “To Kill a Mocking-
bird” isn’t really the question 
here. Lee’s legacy as a canoni-
cal American author is almost 
untouchable. 
However, 
the 

entire situation brings up some 
important questions about the 
rights of artists and the pub-
lic’s sense of entitlement to our 
favorite writers.

SINGLE REVIEW

Fresh off of announcing 

albums set to drop later this 
year, French producer Madeon 
and Passion Pit 
join forces on 
“Pay No Mind” 
– a pop-fueled 
single 
that 

unfortunately 
delivers exactly 
what 
listeners 

would 
expect. 

The track plays 
heavily on both 
artists’ general 
soundscape. For 
Passion Pit, this 
means cloaking not-so-pretty 
subject 
matter 
with 
lead 

singer Michael Angelakos’s 
charming indie-pop falsetto. 
Madeon provides his typically 
funky beat, which does a good 
job of highlighting Angelakos’s 
vocals. The beats are bouncy 
and the chorus is repetitive, 
playing more like a Passion 

Pit remix than an original of 
either artist.

While both Madeon and Pas-

sion Pit, when working individ-
ually, have created great works, 
their combination falls rather 
flat. The single is a fun pop tune, 
but doesn’t go any further than 
that – it is something to nod 
along to but not to be remem-
bered. Passion Pit only scratch-
es the surface of their ability to 

capture complex human emo-
tion and package it as dynamic 
indie pop, as they did on Gos-
samer, and Madeon’s melody, 
while bubbly, lacks the pungen-
cy of some of his other tracks. In 
an attempt to not step on each 
other’s artistic toes, the pairing 
does little more than produce a 
radio-ready reworking of their 
signature sounds.

By CAROLYN DARR

Daily Arts Writer

Someone who describes lines 

as gorgeous and certain writing 
as a miracle can only be a poet. 
Surprisingly, 
Linda 
Gregerson 

didn’t start writing poetry until 
her early twenties, after she 
had finished her undergraduate 
education.

“Of course I loved reading 

poetry and especially my scholarly 
period of 16th and 17th-century 
poetry,” Gregerson said. “I’ve 
always read Shakespeare, read 
Dunn. Dunn was probably how I 
first learned how to be in love with 

poetry, but I did not feel confident 
reading contemporary poetry. It 
was just something I was very 
frightened of.”

Thankfully, a poet friend took 

Gregerson aside and insisted that, 
as an avid scholar of poetry, she 
must begin to write herself, and so 
began to teach her the basics of the 
form. Gregerson wrote on her own 
for awhile, but once she became 
more serious about writing she 
started applying to MFA programs 
and ended up attending University 
of Iowa Writers’ Workshop.

Today Gregerson values poetry 

as both a written, read and lived 
experience. She believes poetry 

allows its readers and writers to 
slow time and truly experience the 
beauty of living.

“It’s 
a 
very 
important 

instrument for encouraging us to 
really inhabit this very fleeting 
present 
tense, 
which 
mostly 

goes by without our noticing,” 
Gregerson remarked. “We’re so 
busy with something that just 
happened and what we’ve got to 
get done next that this moment 
mostly suffers from oblivion and 
neglect, and yet of course it’s all we 
really have.”

During 
her 
MFA 
studies, 

Gregerson honed her craft under 
such poetic greats as Bill Matthews 

ARTIST
PROFILE

IN

VIRGINIA LOZANO/Daily

Poet Linda Gregerson has published five books and teaches creative writing at the University. 

and 
Louise 
Glück. 
Despite 

associating 
with 
these 
heavy 

hitters, Gregerson’s style is wholly 
that of her own. Her poems do 
not follow traditional or received 
form, but rather exemplify those 
of her own creation. A common 
technique running through a 
multitude of her poems is a tercet, 
or three line stanza.

“For me two durable compo-

nents always, always are the line 
and syntax, and I begin by need-
ing them to resist one another,” 
Gregerson stated. “It doesn’t begin 
to be written until it’s lineated, so 
I don’t do some crazy drafts that 
then start going into lines. It’s 
about pacing, units of sense. It’s 
about how much light and air is 
going to be around the words.”

Gregerson has authored five 

books of poetry, and has won 
numerous awards for her writing, 
including the prestigious Kingsley 
Tufts Poetry Award and the 
Pushcart Prize. It should be noted, 
however, that creative writing 
was never her original scholarly 
pursuit. Hired by the University 
in 1967, she originally began as a 
scholar of early modern England, 
a field that she is still very active 
in through both teaching and 
scholarly criticism. Today, while 
still introducing students to the 
lengthy beauty that is Edmund 
Spenser’s “The Faerie Queen,” 
Gregerson has become involved in 
the creative writing department 
and mentoring the University’s 
up-and-coming poets.

Unsurprisingly, 
due 
to 
the 

length and breadth of her poetic 
scholarship, Gregerson found it 
hard to name a poet she adores 
above all others.

“You know I have a million of 

them,” Gregerson said. “Well, of 
all time I can tell you Shakespeare, 
Dunn and Herbert, but (there are) 
also 20th century poets who are 

very important to me. Lately I’ve 
been reading Maryanne Moore a 
lot and a lot more seriously. We all 
adore Elizabeth Bishop, and learn 
a lot from her. Bishop’s villanelle 
‘One Art’ never ceases being 
revelatory to me. There’s (also) just 
a world of wonderful poets coming 
up now in America. There’s just 
hundreds actually, but on the dear-
to-me list at least scores really. I 
feel very lucky to be living at a time 
I’m living where there’s this much 
that’s good being written.”

I find it shocking that Gregerson 

manages to find time to commit to 
reading new work as she balances 
writing 
and 
teaching. 
Upon 

expressing my disbelief, Gregerson 
merely laughed and conceded that 
though time is difficult to find, she 
succeeds.

“It’s a sort of gift in disguise 

when you’re required to read 
on 
assignment,” 
Gregerson 

pronounced. “Most of us at a 
certain point start serving on 
prize committees and panels 
and judge and so forth. I chaired 
a committee for five years that 
called for me to essentially read 
the year in poetry. That’s what you 
do and it’s fabulous. You know, you 
read yourself to sleep at night, you 
get up early and read, you read on 
trains, on busses, you just read all 
the time.”

Reading as much as possible 

is the primary piece of advice 
Gregerson hopes to give to young 
poets. Reading and experiencing 
life to find new subjects to write 
about. Gregerson worries that 
those who have only focused 
on creative writing their entire 
academic careers are missing out 
on the lived experience that adds 
the grain and color to great poems.

“You 
need 
more 
world,” 

Gregerson exclaimed. “You need 
other stuff. Go do anything else. 
Poetry also needs the texture of 

other things, it needs not simply 
to be a closed circle. I find even for 
people who’ve been writing very 
early and know that’s what they 
want to do that sometimes the 
leaps and bounds forward happen 
when there’s a time away.”

As for Gregerson, there is 

no halt. Her next collection of 
new and selected poems will be 
released this coming September. 
Its title poem “Prodigal,” an 
excerpt of which is printed above, 
was originally released in her 
collection Magnetic North and 
may be her favorite poem ever 
penned. All of the new poems in 
her collection have a touchstone 
in Ovid’s “Metamorphoses” and 
those stories of change.

“There are only two subjects, 

right? I mean love and death and 
the way we try to absorb the fact 
that we live in a world founded 
on death, that we are radically 
mortal as is the world we live in,” 
Gregerson commented. “Love 
is probably our big argument 
both against death and our 
consolation for death and that 
inevitable sentence. I think it’s 
a business of poetry to help us 
navigate that both as writers and 
as readers.”

Gregerson 
believes 
poetry 

opens our eyes to the temporality 
of the world.

“I think poetry is about 

focus,” 
she 
observed. 
“It’s 

about trying to be attentive to 
the world so we won’t have to 
live in complete regret that it 
was lost on us while we had it. 
I really think it’s to give us an 
opportunity to actually say at 
some future point that we will 
have been here, we will have 
noticed what happened. That 
we took it in somehow, that we 
honored this very fleeting gift 
of consciousness, physical life, 
companionship, daylight.”

Finding palatable 
classics in Rome

T

o walk through Rome 
is to walk through an 
architectural timeline. 

From Archaic foundations of the 
Forum, to Fascist-era govern-
ment build-
ings, Rome’s 
constant 
inhabitation 
for over a 
millennium 
is palpable. 
But the linear 
progression 
of styles 
is far less 
interesting 
than the rela-
tionships between them. Notions 
of “old” and “new” are revised, 
renamed, recycled— quite literally, 
sometimes. For example, there 
is a beautiful, Early Renaissance 
church near my apartment, San 
Pietro in Montorio, whose facade 
may have been built using traver-
tine harvested from a crumbling 
Colosseum. This is all to say, Rome 

is a city with many different “clas-
sic” eras, each of which reject and 
reinvent the others, and each of 
which is still visible today.

But Roman cuisine, the food 

I identify as “classic,” is a seem-
ingly stable pantheon of dishes. 
Carbonara, fried artichokes, tripe 
… they’re found on most menus 
in Rome, and don’t seem to be 
going anywhere. How I judge 
restaurants in Rome is usually by 
their execution of these classics, 
both in comparison to others and 
some platonic ideal that I pretend 
to have tasted. Most people don’t 
go to Rome to taste “new” food. In 
fact, Rome is one of the few places 
where you could eat on your hon-
eymoon where your parents ate 
on theirs.

I have found something “new” 

in Rome though. Not “new” as in 
undiscovered, for Trapizzino, in 
the Testaccio neighborhood, has 
earned praise and profiles from 
major newspapers in both Italy 
and America. Trapizzino is “new” 

because they have invented a new 
dish which already seems headed 
toward canonization.

The namesake of the restaurant, 

a trapizzino is a sandwich, but it’s 
unlike any other in Rome. The 
name is actually a portmanteau 
of tramezzino, a small sandwich 
served as a snack in Italian cafés, 
and pizza. A “trapizzino,” predict-
ably, is a combination of both. A roll 
made out of pizza dough is cut on 
the diagonal, and the spongy inte-
rior of each triangle is squeezed 
open to form a pocket and filled 
with braised meats or vegetables.

This marriage of two Roman 

classics was officiated by Stefano 
Callegari, a former flight attendant 
turned-pizzaiolo. He opened his 
first pizzeria, Sforno, in 2005, fol-
lowed three years later by 00100, 
named for the zip-code of Rome. 
It was at 00100, in Testaccio, that 
Callegari invented the trapizzino, 
and where I first tasted it two sum-
mers ago.

I was living across the river in 

GIANCARLO 
BUONOMO

Trastevere, and would often stop 
at 00100 for lunch or a snack. I 
savored their potato and speck 
pizza and their suppli, fried 
balls of leftover risotto. I viewed 
00100 as the place for classic 
Roman pizza, and would sneer at 
any other place that I viewed as 
less authentic. Then, one humid 
Saturday afternoon, I stopped 
in for a quick bite. As I grabbed 
a cold Coke from the fridge and 
turned with a practiced motion 
to point at the small pile of suppli, 
the earringed young man behind 
the counter said, “Today, you try 
a trapizzino.” Not knowing what 
he meant, I said yes, and he hand-
ed me a still-warm triangle of 
bread, stuffed with warm tongue 
and salsa verde.

I can only resort to cliché, and 

say that I’ll never forget that first 
bite. The bouncy, fatty tongue, 
cut by the acidic, cool salsa verde, 
all that zesty flavor soaking into 
the chewy, robust bread. I ate 
the whole thing in one continu-
ous, hungry, hungry hippo-like 
motion, and then, without letting 
my mouth rest, called my father 
and ranted to him for 10 minutes 
about this eighth wonder of the 
world.

In the two years between that 

bite and right now, I often pon-
dered the trapizzino. There must 
have been something beyond 
flavor that made me enjoy that 
sandwich so much. And I was 

surprised how much I had liked 
it, because it was “new,” and I 
had come to Rome determined 
to eat nothing but the most text-
book, traditional cucina romana .

People must have had the 

same reaction as me, because 
within the last two years, 00100 
was renamed Trapizzino, the 
pizza discarded, the space reno-
vated and the whole place is 
now dedicated to the titular tri-
angle. I visited the other day, 
and immediately thought, “this 
place would do so well in Brook-
lyn.” An eclectic mix of Soul 
and Motown emanated from the 
kitchen, along with the aroma of 
slow-cooked meats and yeasty 
bread. The restaurant has a faux 
fast food feel to it — the trapizzini 
are served in customized card-
board triangles, which them-
selves rest in between the rungs 
of small metal racks, so that in 
between bites you can rest your 
sandwich filling-side up. They 
make their own beer. Even the 
neighborhood is hip. Testaccio 
was a commercial neighborhood 
in ancient times, whose epony-
mous hill is actually composed of 
hundreds of years worth of dis-
carded amphorae fragments. For 
most of the modern era, it was a 
meat-packing district, until the 
inevitable influx of young people 
and businesses repurposed the 
old houses and factories.

Part of me originally wanted 

to not like Trapizzino. I wanted 
tradition, not gentrification, old-
school, not hip. But Trapizzino is 
actually all of these things, and 
because of that, is actually more 
“Roman” than most places. Let 
me explain. Trapizzini are not 
“traditional,” in the sense that 
no one ate them back in 1930. But 
what they’re filled with — oxtails, 
tongue, lamb innards, boiled beef 
— is. There’s nothing really “new” 
about them, other than the way in 
which they’ve reinvented and rei-
magined Roman cuisine. Like the 
church of San Pietro in Montorio, 
they’re a new icon formed out of 
old ones.

I’m tempted to call these lit-

tle sandwiches a metaphor for 
Rome itself. But then again, part 
of Rome’s charm is that it resists 
metaphor in favor of unadulterat-
ed joy. After I finished one trapiz-
zino of chicken braised in vinegar, 
I ambled inside to give back my 
metal rack. I didn’t need another 
— I had just come for research. 
As I placed the rack on the coun-
ter, the pony-tailed mod behind 
the counter looked at me, pointed 
to the steaming pot of braised 
oxtails and gingerly picked up a 
hot triangle from the oven. He 
was right — there was no way I 
could leave after just one.
