Lecturers' Employee Organization President Bonnie Halloran, a lecturer at the University's Dearborn campus, leads a protest for equal pay on Friday'
O rallies or equal pay

Protesters also
decry right-to-
work legislation
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
As contract negotiations
with the University began last
week, about 40 members of the
Lecturers' Employee Organiza-
tion and other union support-
ers gathered at the entrance
to Palmer Commons on Friday
afternoon to rally in support of
LEO.

LEO, which represents
about 1,500 non-tenure track
lecturers at the University's
Ann Arbor, Dearborn and Flint
campuses,.also announced the
publication of a report alleging
a significant gap in pay between
professors and lecturers. LEO's
current contract is set to expire
in April and LEO president
Bonnie Halloran spoke to the
crowd about the current labor
situation faced by lecturers,
amid outbursts of chants and
cheers.
"(The report) shows that
while we are doing the lion's
work, we're only being paid

half as much to teach a class
as our fellow professors on
campus," Halloran said. "They
get twice the amount of dol-
lars to basically teach the same
amount of class, so we need to
see a change."
Speakers at the event, which
came a day after anti-union
legislation passed the state
Legislature, also addressed
Michigan's progression to a
right-to-work state.
"This has an impact on us
here at the University while
we're bargaining our contract,"
Halloran said. "We're an exam-
ple of an outstanding union

that works with our employer
to make better working condi-
tions and to create better con-
ditions at the University itself
and for the students."
Several members of the
Graduate Employees' Organi-
zation also attended, including
Rackham student Katie Frank,
the president of GEO, who also
spoke at event.

Ann Arbor-based

By TYLER BAILEY
Daily Arts Writer
In a town like Ann Arbor with
a large restaurant scene, what
do you do when you want to
try somewhere new to eat? You
could ask a friend or someone
you know for a recommenda-
tion, or you could checka review
website to get the scoop on the
best places in town.
Both of these have their ups
and downs, but a group of stu-
dents have formed a start-up
company that combines the
interactivity of social media
with the spot-on recommen-
dations of restaurant reviews.
With their site, MyFabS, the stu-
dents hope to add a new twist
to the monotony of sites such as
Yelp and Urbanspoon.

Mascot will stop hunting with rifle

The man who plays the West
Virginia Mountaineers mascot
will no longer hunt with his mas-
cot rifle after online videos of him
killing a bear surfaced last week,
the Daily Athanaeum reported.
Jonathan Kimble, who plays the
mountaineer, did not violate any
laws or University codes in hunt-
ing with the university's rifle, and
WVU defended his actions as part
of the persona of the Mountain-
eer mascot. However, the videos
sparked outrage from students,
who questioned the hunting meth-
ods, the age of the bear and wheth-
er Kimble should be hunting with
the university-distributed rifle.
Kimble defended his actions
by telling the newspaper that past
Mountaineers have hunted with

the rifle and called hunting part of
West Virginian culture and tradi-
tion.
He said he would continue
hunting with his own rifles, but
agreed with WVU officials that
doing so with the mascot rifle was
inappropriate after meeting with
them in the wake of the backlash.
MARYLAND PRES. FORMS
COMMISSION TO SMOOTH
BIG TEN MOVE
Wallace Loh, the president of
the University of Maryland, will
form a commission to study how,
the College Park-based institution
can maximize the benefits of its
move to the Big Ten Conference,
the Diamondback reported.

The commission, officially
named the President's Commis-
sion on UMD and Big Ten/CIC
Integration, will look for the best
ways to support student-athletes
during the transition and the best
practices to use the conference's
revenue sharing.
"This is not just something the
university administration should
closet in a room and do by itself,"
Loh said in an announcement last
week, according to the newspa-
per. "There's never going to be
100 percent agreement, so what
you want is as open, as transpar-
ent, as broadly represented con-
versations as you can possibly
have."

Senator gets bag of
coal after right-to-
work vote
A Republican state senator has
received a bag of coal from union-
rights demonstrators protesting
her vote to make Michigan a right-
to-work state.
About 60 people sang Christ-
mas-themed protest songs and
carried picket signs Sunday out-
side the Kalamazoo office of state
Sen. Tonya Schuitmaker.
The state Senate and House
voted Thursday's for bills that
would bar unions from collecting
mandatory fees from workers they
represent under collective bar-
gaining agreements.
Mlive.com reports that one pro-
test sign said Gov. Rick Snyder is
"tearing Michigan apart." Others
said "Right 2 Work Hurts Work-

Romney's '47
percent' chosen as
year's best quote
Former Republican presiden-
tial candidate Mitt Romney's
comments about 47 percent of
the population dependent on the
government and "binders full of
women" topped this year's best
quotes, according to a Yale Uni-
versity librarian.
Fred Shapiro, associate librar-
ian at Yale Law School, released
his seventh annual list of the most
notable quotations of the year.
"Debate remarks and gaffes
actually seemed to play an impor-
tant role in the ups and downs of the
election campaign and may even
have affected the ultimate outcome
ofthe election," Shapiro said.
Romney, who lost the Novem-
ber election to President Barack
Obama, made the 47 percent com-
ment at a private fundraiser in
May that was secretly recorded
and posted online in September by
Mother Jones magazine.
MONTEREY, Mexico
Singer feared dead
in plane crash
The wreckage of a small plane
believed to be carrying Jenni Rive-
ra, the U.S-born singer whose soul-
ful voice and unfettered discussion
of a series of personal travails made
her a Mexican-American music
superstar, was found in northern
Mexico on Sunday. Authorities said
there were no survivors.
Her family said they were in
mourning and Rivera's brother
would travel to Mexico on Mon-
day to identify what they pre-
sumed were her remains.
Born in Long Beach, Califor-
nia, Rivera was at the peak of her
career as perhaps the most suc-
cesaful female singer in grupero,
a male-dominated regional style
influenced by the norteno, cumbia
and ranchero styles.

Chavez faces new cancer
battle, surgery in Cuba

Venezuelen
president heads into
third surgery
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP)
- Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez was heading back to
Cuba on Sunday for a third can-
cer surgery after naming his vice
president as his choice to lead the
country if the illness cuts short
his presidency.
Chavez's announcement on
Saturday night unleashed new
uncertainty about the coun-
try's future, and his supporters
poured into city plazas across
the nation to pray for his recov-
ery from what appears to be an
aggressive type of cancer.
Some wiped tears, while oth-
ers held photos of him and chant-
ed in unison: "Ooh-Ah! Chavez
isn't going away!"
Chavez acknowledged the
seriousness of his health situa-
tion in a televised address, say-
ing for the first time that if he

suffers complications Vice Presi-
dent Nicolas Maduro should be
elected as Venezuela's leader to
continue his socialist movement.
Several outside medical
experts said that based on
Chavez's account of his condition
and his treatment, so far, they
doubt the cancer can be cured.
Chavez said he hasn't given up.
"With the grace of God,
we'll come out victorious," said
Chavez, who held up a crucifix
and kissed it during his Saturday
night appearance.
The 58-year-old president is
still scheduled to be sworn in for
a new six-year term Jan. 10. He
has been in office fdr nearly 14
years, since 1999.
"There are risks. Who can
deny it?" Chavez said, seated at
the presidential palace beside
Maduro and other aides. "In any
circumstance, we should guar-
antee the advance of the Bolivar-
ian Revolution."
Chavez, who won re-election
on Oct. 7, said he would undergo
surgery in Havana in the com-

ing days. Lawmakers on Sunday
voted unanimously to grant him
permission to leave the country
for the operation.
During the session at the
National Assembly, opposition
lawmakers agreed to Chavez's
request and also said that Mad-
uro should take on his duties
during his temporary absence, as
the constitution specifies. Oppo-
sition lawmaker Julio Borges
criticized the incomplete infor-
mation that has been released
about Chavez's cancer, saying:
"Venezuela has a right tb know
the truth."
Throughout his treatment,
Chavez has kept secret various
details about his illness, includ-
ing the precise location of the
tumors and the type of cancer.
He has said he travels to Cuba
for treatment because his cancer
was diagnosed by doctors there.
National Assembly President
Diosdado Cabello said there are
no plans at this time for Chavez
to cede power, even temporarily,
as president.

Man attacks family
members; suspect
shot by police
PORTERVILLE, Calif. (AP)
- The church bell that rings out
to announce the deaths of tribal
members on the Tule River Indi-
an Reservation tolled repeatedly
Sunday after a man killed his
mother and her two brothers
in a shooting that also fatally
wounded his daughter. Authori-
ties said the suspect also died in
a shootout with police.
Authorities cornered Hector
Celaya, 31, on a country road in
the middle of citrus orchards 30
miles away from the reservation
and about six hours after the
shootings Saturday night, that
also left two of his other chil-
dren wounded.
In the car with him were two
daughters, 8-year-old Alyssa
and 5-year-old Linea. One had
life-threatening injuries; the
other did not.
Authorities said Celaya was
fatally wounded by deputies
after he opened fire on them.
By Sunday night, authorities
confirmed thatAlyssa died of her
injuries. Police said Celaya had a
tattoo of her name on his right leg.
Authorities have not disclosed
what motivated Celaya to kill his
relatives, who lived in a travel
trailer on a family compound on
the reservationof about 800peo-
ple. But tribal members said the
former custodian at the reserva-
tion's casino had a troubled past.
"He had a real hard life," said,
Rhoda Hunter, the tribal council
secretary."But all of usdo, we all
have a hard time. But we try not
to let it get the best of us."
Hunter said that Celaya's
mother was a friend of hers. The
Tulare County sheriff's depart-
ment, which is investigating the
case, identified her 60-year-old
Irene Celaya.

The killings stunned the
tightknittribal community
"We've had a lot of deaths
here, but nothing like this. Not
murder. No, not murder," Hunt-
er said.
The remote reservation relies
on the Eagle Mountain Casino
for revenues. Each tribal mem-
ber receives $500 a month, but
Hunter said most of the profit is
invested into educational pro-
grams for the children.
The compound where the
shooting took place is on a dirt
road in a scenic canyon lined
with oaks and sycamore trees.
Herds of horses graze the hill-
sides, and modular houses sit on
hilltops.
The 911 call came to the Tule
River Indian Reservation fire
department at about 7:45 p.m.
Saturday, said Shelby Charley
Jr., an engineer and supervisor.
He said his crew, which most
often attends to people who fall
ill at the casino, was shocked by
the carnage.
"This is a once in a lifetime
kind of deal," Charley said. "It's
one of those calls you could go
your whole career and not walk
into. This is one of those calls
that will stick with you for the
rest of your life."
Charley said his crew imme-
diately discovered a woman and
man dead of gunshot wounds,
then quickly discovered a young
boy with critical wounds. Thick
fog grounded helicopters in
Fresno and Bakersfield, so res-
cue workers had to drive the
gravely injured boy 40 minutes
to the nearest hospital in Visalia.
Minutes later, sheriff's depu-
ties found a third body in an out-
building thathad been set up as a
makeshift bedroom. Authorities
said the bodies of Irene Celaya
and her 61-year-old brother
Francisco Moreno were found
in the trailer. The body of their
53-year-old brother, Bernard
Franco, was in the shed.

around 80 percent of the roughly

draft statement seen by reporters,
the opposition said it would con-
test the results.
"This situation, if allowed to
go unchallenged and uncorrect-
ed, would seriously damage the
essence of the electoral process
and the substance of democracy in
Ghana," the New Patriotic Party
said in a draft statement that was
emailed to reporters.
"To accept this result is to dis-
credit democracyin Ghana and, in
the process, distort the process of

polling stations, forcing officials
to extend voting into a second day.
Akufo-Addo's party has accused
the ruling party of using the dis-
order causedby the technical fail-
ure to rig the election.
Ghanaians are deeply attached
to their tradition of democracy,
and international observers are
already calling Friday's election

country's history. No other coun-
try in the region has had as many
free and fair votes. However, ana-
lysts point out that Ghana's his-
tory and its record of democratic
progress is not that different from
that of nearby Mali, a nation also
considered a model democracy
until a coup this spring.
The outcome of the election will

"We won, they are sore losers.
They wanted (the electoral com-
mission) to postpone announce-
ment of the results and (the
chairman) said there is no reason

Tony Aidoo. He added that the
opposition's allegation of vote rig-
ging "was a plan to create may-
hem, and mayhem will come....

of coming back to power."
Earlier on Sunday, police fired
tear gas and stun guns to fight,

them to withhold announcing

"Considering the closeness of
the polls this error is very sig-

sebi-Lamptey, chairman of the
opposition party.
Despite the allegations, inter-
national observers endorsed the
elections, callingthe vote credible

failure of the voter identification

precincts. The election was also
plagued by delays due to the late

Consequences for unions may be dire
After the defeat of Proposal 2 - which would have enshrined
union rights on the state constitution - on the November
ballot, state Republicans smelled an opportunity and decid-
ed to push through legislation that would make Michigan the 24th
right-to-work state. The circumstances of this legislation can be
described as shady, to say the least. Protesters outside the Michigan
Capitol were sprayed with mace last week. Some were locked out of
the building on the grounds that it was "at capacity," a claim that
was later shown false. This controversy surrounding the protests
outside the State Capitol underlines the controversial nature of the
right-to-work legislation itself.

ance to oppose the DIA in a mis-
guided attempt to protect taxpayers.

like plaintiff, Simon Haddad to tell

Detroit's cultural centers.

The MTA - along with many
other anti-tax raising organizations
- frequently oversimplifies issues
and looks solely at the bottom line
when passing judgment. It is impor-
tant to not join the other extreme
and blindly support proposals that
require tax increases, but to con-
sider the entire implications of an
issue. If the DIA was to fail, Detroit
would lose a cultural landmark that
draws tourists, educates and inspires
thousands of local residents. It has
been the center of Detroit's revival
by sponsoring shows from local
artists and documenting the city's
recovery. The Michigan Taxpayers
Alliance should accept its loss from
this summer, drop this petty lawsuit
and move on to protecting taxpay-
ers instead of attacking Detroit icons
such as the DIA.

As one of the most unionized states in
the country, the workers of Michigan have a
vested interest in this legislation. The argu-
ment at the core of the right-to-work debate
is whether or not workers should be required
to join a union in their industry. Almost all
right-to-work states are states in the South
or Southwest and passed their right-to-work
legislation decades ago. The most recent state
to pass such legislation was Wisconsin after
extreme contention, and Gov. Scott Walker
faced a recall election as a result of the legis-
lative battle. Currently, 23 states have right-
to-work laws that allow workers to opt out of
union membership, including both the dues
and the benefits of membership.
Efforts to make Michigan's debate more civil
than Wisconsin's were unsuccessful. Pretend-
ing that the Capitol building is at capacity sim-
ply to keep protesters out is ridiculous. Lying
and misleading protesters for whatever reason
is unacceptable. Though the bill receives almost
universal Republican support, six Republican
state representatives and four Republican state
senators refuse to support the bill, citing their
party's expedience as a primary concern.

Evidence regarding the claim that right-
to-work will increase economic growth
usually isn't favorable. The Economic Pol-
icy Institute, a liberal think tank based in
Washington D.C., published an analysis of
economic growth in Oklahoma that was con-
ducted over the past decade. The state, which
introduced right-to-work laws in 2001, has
seen jobs in the highly unionized manufac-
turing sector fall. This is consistent with
opponents who insist that passing this legis-
lation will result in a net decrease in wages
for both union and non-union members in
their respective industries.
Furthermore, union membership in Michi-
gan has declined significantly over the past
six decades, according to the Detroit Free
Press's interview with Michigan State Eco-
nomics Prof. Charles Ballard. This means that
the economic impact of the legislation will be
minimal, if not negligible - it will only accel-
erate an already established trend. Hopefully,
the chaotic circumstances surrounding the
passage of this legislation will be rectified and
right-to-work's consequences for the state's
unions won't be too dire.

fStand up for fairness.

Mark Bernstein, a newly elected mem-
ber of the University of Michigan's Board of
Regents, campaigned on the slogan "Make Col-
lege Affordable." However, for some students
who've lived in Michigan the majority of their
lives, affordable University tuition is a foreign
concept. The University is denying in-state
tuition to undocumented students who know
Michigan as their home and have graduated
from the state's high schools. After earning
admission by merit, the steep price of out-of-
state tuition, which is nearly $25,000 more per
year than the tuition paid by in-state admits,
effectively prohibits potential students from
accessingthe higher education they deserve.
The University prides itself in enrolling the
leaders and the best. However, its residency
policy says otherwise. The UM American Civil
Liberties Union Undergraduate Chapter seeks
to reform this disturbing policy. The ACLU
strongly supports the efforts of the Coalition
for Tuition Equality and its efforts to advocate
fair tuition practices for all students.
An undocumented student is typically
brought to the United States at a young age
with his or her parents and played no part
in his family's choice to immigrate. Michi-
gan is where these students have grown up
and where they call home. In total, there are
currently an estimated 11.2 million undocu-
mented immigrants in the United States.
Undocumented immigrants represent a
diverse section of the American population.
They come from all parts of the world, fre-
quently to flee oppression or economic hard-
ship and explore the opportunities presented
in America. Yet the University's tuition poli-
cies are barriers that prevent undocumented
Americans from realizing their dreams.
In most senses, undocumented Michigan
residents are faced with the same set of gov-
ernmental obligations as any other Michigan
resident. They are subject to the same laws,
send their children to the same schools and pay
the same taxes that all Michigan residents pay.
In 2010, according to the Service Employees
International Union, state and local taxes paid
by families headed by undocumented immi-
grants totaled $141,662,286 in Michigan. Their
taxes, in part, finance the University, yet out-
of-state tuition prevents them from benefitting

fairly from those taxes.
In a legal brief supporting the DREAM Act,
federal legislation that remains in political
limbo, the ACLU cites tuition equality as an
effective policy to help undocumented Ameri-
cans contribute productively to the American
economy. The brief applauds states that have
adopted tuition equality and asserts, "... a well-
educated population leads to increased earning
power which then generates higher income,
sales, and property taxes. This in turn stimu-
lates economic growth for all participants in
the states' economies, while increasing the
nation's competitiveness in the global econ-
omy." The benefits of tuition equality extend
beyond deserving undocumented students to
society as a whole by producing a well-educat-
ed, productive and highly skilled workforce.
In 2010, the California Supreme Court
upheld a widely adopted form of tuition
equality, which requires qualifying students
to attend a California high schoolfor at least
three years. California adopted tuition equal-
ity in 2001. Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, New
Mexico, New York, Utah and Washington are
in another group of 12 states with similar pro-
visions. The University needs to adopt tuition
equality to ensure that these talented, undocu-
mented students have equal access to the high-
er education they deserve.
The ACLU Undergraduate Chapter of the
University of Michigan is a partner in the
Coalition for Tuition Equality - a collec-
tion of student organizations on campus that
fight for in-state tuition for undocumented
students. We believe that tuition equality is
a fundamental right that the University of
Michigan is denying undocumented Michi-
gan residents. To get involved in CTE, you
can attend the rally for tuition equality this
Thursday, Dec. 13 at 3:30 p.m. in the Kuenzel
Room of the Michigan Union.
I'm proud to attend a college that is so vocal
for its promotion of diversity and social justice
on campus. We must continue to push for what
is fair, what is right, and what is just. Tuition
equality will bring the University closer to pro-
viding students who merit admission an equal
opportunity for abright future.

ne of my friends (let's call
him Bill) loves talking
about stocks, entrepreneur-
ial ideas and politics with me. Bill
is one of those
guys who is
always thinking
of a new busi-
ness idea and
someone you just
know will make
it big one day.
Although a few
of Bill's business PATRICK
ideas are ques- MAILLET
tionable, the vast
majority of them
are solid and well thought out.
Over the weekend, Bill and I
were hanging out with some friends
when he asked for my opinion on
a new investment he was planning
to make. His plan was to short sell
U.S. Treasury bills. For those of you
who may not know, short selling
is used by traders who believe the
share price of a stock, or in this case
a Treasury bill, will decline. With-
out going through all the economic
details, short selling U.S. treasury
bills is basically like betting against
the American economy.
Bill said he had been watching
the fiscal cliff talks, or lack thereof,
and couldn't help but believe that a
compromise was unachievable and
that America would be tossed off
the fiscal cliff.
Traditionally, those who bet
against America usually lose. Even
after America's credit rating was
downgraded two years ago, inves-
tors still flocked to U.S. treasury
bills as an economic safe haven. I
tried telling Bill this age-old "rule
of thumb" but I couldn't help get-
ting a little depressed about the
very distinct chance that his invest-
ment strategy might actually work.
Without massive compromises
from both sides, our economy may
be in some serious trouble.
In 21 days, America falls off the
proverbial "fiscal cliff" unless an

agreement is reached. Both Demo-
crats and Republicans appear to be
holding fast to their principles as the
clock keeps ticking down. Whether
they want to or not, everyone in
Washington needs to be prepared for
some pivotal changes.
First off, taxes on the wealthiest
Americans must go up. Government
revenue is at a 60-year low, making
it impossible to justify the extension
of tax breaks for the wealthiest 2 per-
cent of Americans. Also, let's not for-
get the tax rate for millionaires and
billionaires will rise from 35 percent,
the rate set by President George W.
Bush's tax breaks, to 39 percent, the
rate that was set during President
Bill Clinton's tenure. This isn't class
warfare, and it certainly isn't social-
ism. Returning the tax rate for the
wealthiest Americans to that of the
1990s - a time of massive economic
growth - is the most logical way to
begin raising government revenue to
where ithas to be.
In order to raise taxes on the
wealthiest Americans, the Demo-
crats are going to have to compro-
mise on a social program spending
cut. The age of eligibility for Social
Security benefits must be raised
from 65 to at least 67. I'm sorry Mom,
Dad, and every other fellow liberal,
I know it seems like I've betrayed
you. But people, we need to face
the facts: Republicans simply won't
agree to tax raises unless we give
them a social benefit cut. Men and
women who retire today at age 65 can
expect to live on average to 83 and 85,
respectively. The original purpose of
Social Security was to support those
who retire at 65 for a decade, not for
two. If life expectancy rises as much
as it has, why shouldn't the retire-
ment age be slightly raised?- Also,
with an enormous aging population,
the entire program seems to be on
the brink of bankruptcy. Without
a serious change, our parents will
bankrupt Social Security and leave
us with nothingto depend on.
Most importantly, America

needs to drastically cut its defense
spending. In 2011, America spent
$695.7 billion on national defense.
This is not only the most expen-
sive defense budget in the world,
but larger than the next 12 nations
following us combined. Ever since
9/11, American defense spending
has been out of control. Unfortu-
nately, increasing military spend-
ing is just like gaining unwanted
weight - it's a hell of a lot easier
putting it on than losing it.
Washington
needs to
compromise to
prevent calamity.
If politicians act to reduce this
mammoth budget, they're threat-
ened with losing their campaign
support from huge corporate
donors such as Boeing, Lockheed
Martin and various other defense
contractors. America has become a
military empire with more than 662
foreign bases in more than 38 other
countries. Yes, cutting defense
spending may result in the loss of
jobs, particularly some employees
of the corporations listed, but with-
out drastic cuts American defense
spending will never be curbed and
will continue to rise uncontrollably.
These three proposals are far from
unique and, will certainly not cure
our fiscal problems alone. Instead,
they should be considered stepping
stones for compromise. Without a
serious agreement, particularly in
these three fields, I fear that Amer-
ica may be driven off the fiscal cliff.
Sorry Bill, you're a good friend, but I
pray that your bet is wrong.

CSG ELECTIONS
From Page 1A
"In the past, even in the smaller
November elections, we've had
way more candidates than there
are seats," he said, attributing the
lack of candidates to poor adver-
tisement of the election.
Walser argued that voter turn-
out for the CSG elections could
be attributed to other student
governments on campus rather
than to CSG itself.
"A lot of the turnout was the
result of the work of the LSA
Student. Government and other
student governments across
campus," Walser said. "It was
really embarrassing to me to
have CSG do virtually nothing
to advertise the election - that's
just a terrible precedent going
into the March election."
Walser said he also tried to
find an application a few days
before the election and couldn't.
"I imagine for students not
well versed with CSG, (getting
registered) would have been
virtually impossible unless they
were involved with a party," he
said.
In addition to problems cre-
ated by a lack of time, issues
concerning the Rackham and
LSA-SG representative ballots
were "unexplainable," Walser
said.
The Rackham ballot only
allowed voters to vote for one
person, despite eight seats being
up for grabs. That problem even-
tually led organizers to extend
the election 48 hours and release
an entirely new ballot for Rack-
ham students.
The LSA-SG representative
ballot allowed voters to choose
three candidates when only two
seats were open. In the end, the
third place finisher lost 531 to
436 total votes and 1,321 to 1,196
weighted votes, which are cal-
culated based on how students
ranked a candidate.
"I think it's a terrible prec-
edent because this election was
clearly not really fair and demo-
cratic," Walser said.
Wasler said staff from the Uni-
versity's Information and Tech-
nology Services assured student
government officials that tech-
nological problems with the bal-
lot didn't affect the results, but
argued that the ballot still had
errors.
"ITS claiming that (problems
with the LSA ballot) didn't affect
the election results to me is not
sufficient because there was
clearly a mistake on the ballot,"

Wasler said.
Walser said ensuring a proper
election needs to a be a higher
priority for CSG president Man-
ish Parikh and CSG vice presi-
dent Omar Hashwi.
"These ideas of longer library
hours, a 24-hour cafe are great,
but the administration also has to
focus onthe basics and getting the
fundamentals down," Walser said.
"I think they need to reflect on
their priorities and make sure that
they're getting the fundamentals
down as well as the external stuff
they're working on."
Wasler is a member of MFor-
ward, which supported candi-
dates in the election in which
Parikh and Hashwi were elected.
Walser added that it is impor-
tant that CSG start looking for
a director and election commis-
sion position for the upcoming
March election immediately to
avoid similar problems in the
spring.
Law student Jeremy Garson,
CSG's November election direc-
tor, acknowledged the problems
with the elections, but said they
lived up to the necessary bench-
marks, especially if the time con-
straints placed on the election
are taken into consideration.
"The election went about as
well as it could under the cir-
cumstances," Garson said. "The
importantthingwith anyelection
... is you need to make sure every-
one who has the right to vote is
able to vote, everyone who wishes
to run can run and when the votes
are counted, there is no fraud."
Garson also disagreed with
Walser's point, affirming his
belief that the LSA elections
were an accurate reflection of the
wishes of LSA students.
"From talking to ITS, from
talking with other people that
have more experience, I'm con-
fident that we were able to get
the wishes of the electorate to be
properly represented," he said. ,
Garson explained that his own
health. caused additional chal-
lenges into an already tumultu-
ous election.
"I tip my hat to my team," Gar-
son said. "I was sick on the night
of the election; I had to go to the
hospital next day."
Garson credited CSG student
general counsel Lukas Garske, an
LSA senior, in particular for the
election's success.
"Everything that went right,
went right because of (Garske),"
he said.
With the March election now
ahead, Garson said the lesson
learned from this election is that
time is invaluable.

"Going into the future, it's
just a matter of getting all the
pieces into place so that we can
do advertising in a more system-
atic way rather than having to
scramble against the firm clock,"
Garson said.
Garske echoed- Garson when
he wrote in an e-mail that sev-
eral factors affected CSG's abil-
ity to hold a timely and efficient
election. Because the all-campus
constitution maintains that the
elections must be held in Novem-
ber, the election dates chosen
were placed as late in November
as possible in order to facilitate
the difficult time constraints CSG
faced, Garske wrote.
"The presence of the Thanks-
giving break added another ele-
ment of complication to this," he
wrote. "Overall this meant that
when the Election Code passed
we had 28 days to prepare for the
elections if you include holiday
time and weekends; if you remove
holidays and weekends we were
left with 15 days. "
Despite these missed dead-
lines, Garske said the only per-
son who could file a complaint
alleging injury from the election
would be a candidate and even
then the statute of limitations on
filing that complaint has already
passed.
Garske also highlighted the
new election code, saying that
while it added stress to this elec-
tion, it would ease tension in
upcoming elections.
"The creation of a new, com-
prehensive Election. Code is the
most important development here
as it will ensure elections run
smoothly in the future," Garske
wrote. "We could have rushed to
put an Election Code in place as
quickly as possible, but believed it
was more important that a strong
framework be built upon which
future elections could rely consis-
tently."
Rackham Student Government
President Michael Benson said he
too had problems with CSG's han-
dling of the election. Benson said
he called the CSG front office sev-
eral times throughout September
and October to find out when CSG
had scheduled its elections so
that RSG could schedule its elec-
tions to coincide with CSG's.
"Given how not put together
CSG was this-time-around with
their elections I'm not sure if
we're going to overlap with them
truthfully," Benson said. "If they
can't hold one of their smaller
elections to the quality and stan-
dard that they have in the past ...
I'm not sure if I feel comfortable
leaving those details to them."

educating the future of the
state of Michigan and we know
who is doing that here; it's our
lecturers doing the bulk of this
work."
LSA senior Ian Matchett, the
founder of the Student Union

of Michigan, also spoke at the
event and said that a good edu-
cation isn't the result of "fancy
buildings" or "administrative
pay." While SUM is dedicated to
freezing tuition costs, Matchett
said that shouldn't come at the
expense of lecturers.
University lecturer Lila
Naydan, a LEO spokeswoman,
said in an interview after the

event that raising the wages of
lecturers does not automati-
cally mean that tuition will
rise.
"It would be very easy for the
University of Michigan to do
this without raising tuition,"
she said. "Tuition for (stu-
dents) would not have to go up.
We don't want tuition for (stu-
dents) to go up."


MYFAB5
From Page 1A
ni Omeid Seirafi-pour, Calvin
Schemanski and John Gulbron-
son, MyFab5 utilizes a restau-
rant ranking system instead of
the typical star-rating system
used by other similar sites.
"With a typical star system,
you give a business a rating from
bad to good," Seirafi-pour said.
"One star is really bad, five stars
is really good. On our system
you don't ever rate a business. In
fact, on our platform you never
talk about bad businesses. All
you do is talk about your favorite
businesses."
Users select their "Fab Five"
in different categories of restau-
rants and bars, and the possi-
bilities for rankings are endless
because, unlike other sites,
MyFab5 has an infinite selec-
tion of subcategories in which to
rank different establishments.
Instead of a generalized blan-
ket ranking for one type of res-
taurant, MyFab5 allows users to
get specific,-for example giving
them the option to rank certain
types of dishes.
"You go to any number of
websites to find a great restau-
rant, but then you have to do
some research to figure out why
it's so great," Seirafi-pour said.
"With us, we can give you that
information much quicker.
"It also gets quirky and ran-

dom because people can create
their own categories," Ruff said.
"If you want to find a place for
good pickles, we actually have a
category for that."
MyFab5 seeks to open up the
restaurant website to be more
socially oriented and to give
users more control. In turn,
they'll get a better view of what's
going on in their city. With the
design, people will be able to
show other users what they like
about a business, along with
each business's unique style and
qualities that keep them coming
back to their favorite spots.
MyFab5 hopes to make the
restaurant-hunting experience
more organic, as users can see
what makes each restaurant
special - from the street-food
inspired burgers of Frita Bati-
dos to the late-night magic of a
slice of South U Pizza.
With Ann Arbor's bustling
restaurant scene and tech-savvy
population, the city seems like
a natural choice to be MyFab5's
first city of operation - not to
mention its University con-
nection, Seirafi-pour said. The
project is based out of TechArb,
a University start-up accelera-
tor supported by the Center for
Entrepreneurship that aims to
help University students bring
their ideas to life and build via-
ble ventures in an educational
experience.
Seirafi-pour said Ann Arbor's
start-up environment was a

draw to the city.
"There's access to people to
collaborate with (and) access to
socially engaged students," he
said. "The one thing that Ann
Arbor can do right now is really
show that we are a community
that supports people."
That's not to say that creat-
ing a start-up company from
scratch didn't have its obstacles.
"I enjoy- running into dif-
ficulties, because if you don't
run into difficulties ... you're
probably not pushing yourself
hard enough," Seirafi-pour said.
"We fail a lot, but the important
thing is we've been learning a
lot. If you ask us why we're the
most excited, it's because we
know this next month is going
to be the best month and the
month after that is going to be
even better."
He added that failure is part
of the start-up formula.
"You have to learn from your
mistakes, you have to adapt," he
said.
The developers don't plan to
stop at just ranking Ann Arbor
restaurants. With the goals for
expansion, they hope MyFab5
could eventually rank every-
thing from sushi places to Gucci
laces.
"The long-term mission could
be - imagine ranking your top
five rap songs, top five albums in
2012, top five places for suits,"
Ruff said. "The opportunities
are endless."

police.
Small said he plans to use the
grant money to help outsource
development or design elements
of the app if he can't do them
himself.
"I had this idea, I've been
wanting to make it happen, and
I figured hey, I may as well enter
it into the competition," Small
said. "It was nice to see how
other people felt about it."
The Web & Software award
went to LSA junior Jessica
Ruiz, the creator of Family
First, a social networking-type
website where users can con-
nect to family members across
the nation, in the vein of Google
Plus.
Ruiz said she plans to apply
for more grants in order to
finance her endeavor, as well
as put a team together. She said
she was required to apply to the
competition as part of an entre-
r-

preneurship class and didn't
initially give much thought to
winning.
"I'm happy I won, obvious-
ly," Ruiz said. "It's a good foot
in the door for future entrepre-
neurial activities."
LSA sophomore Max Gilles,
the marketing director of
MPowered, said the event
showcased exceptional Univer-
sity talent and that he's looking
forward to continuing the com-
petitions next year.
"It was really great to see the
enetgy and the passion from
the students here," Gilles said.
"It was really great to see all
the speakers too, the past win-
ners."
Student entrepreneurs will
have at least two more chances
to win grant money to further
their startup ideas. At the end
of the ceremony, Thomas Zur-
buchen, the University's asso-.
ciate dean of entrepreneurial
programs, announced he will
host another entrepreneur-
ial competition this coming

March, with a payout of $5,000
to one winner.
MPowered also announced it
is hosting another competition
in January in association with
Start Garden, a $15-million'
fund that invests in two busi-
ness propositions each week.
During the competition, select-
ed students will participate in
a live "Shark Tank"-style pitch
contest - a format based on
the' ABC reality show "Shark
Tank". Two students will each
win a prize of $5,500 for their
enterprise.
1000 Pitches is one of several
annual events held by MPow-
ered. The club also hosts career
fair, a Startup Weekend where
students pitch and develop a
business plan in 54 hours, and
a two-week trip to Kenya in
which University students aid
Kenyan high school students to
develop businesses.
All pitchvideos and addition-
al information on the winners
can be found on MPowered's
website.

cy room at the University Hospi-
tal.
University Police spokeswoman
Diane Brown said the man was
"significantly" injured, but has
since been released from the Uni-
versity Hospital. Due to privacy
laws, the man's name is not being
released at this time, and his cur-
rent condition and specific inju-
ries sustained during the incident
are unknown.
The man was visiting from
Ohio, Brown said, and University
Police believe that his hosts may
have been sleeping in the room at
the time of the incident.
Brown noted that police do not
think there were any witnesses

and are investigatinghow the man
fell from the window.
"It's a personal injury inves-
tigation to determine what hap-
pened including if there was a
crime committed, but at this point
we have no evidence to indicate
anything other than this being an
accident," Brown said.
The campus community was
not notified because the incident
did not pose a public safety risk,
she added.
Brown said window ,limiters,
which prevent a window from
opening fully, were in place and
functioning at the time of the inci-
dent. University students com-
monly keep windows open, even
in winter, as it allows-for tempera-
ture control without individual
thermostats.
"It's a veryunfortunate circum-

stances but there have been a lot
of people who have lived in these
residence halls and stayed in these
residence halls and sometimes
these accidents will happen,"
Brown said. "(We) try to minimize
those and try to prevent them."
In a similar incident in 1998,
then-LSA freshman Courtney
Cantor died when she fell out of
her sixth floor room in Markley.
Cantor had allegedly been
consuming alcohol at a Phi Delta
Theta fraternity party prior to
the fall, and an autopsy report
revealed traces ofGHB, a Schedule
I controlled substance, The Michi-
gan Daily reported at the time.
Cantor's family suedthe fraternity
and the University, which eventu-
ally agreed to pay $100,000.

"So we're best friends now, right?"
No surprises in
lazy, tired 'Keeps'

McDreary.
Time for 'Grey's' to die

Butler, Biel star
in typical, cookie-
cutter rom-com
By CONRAD FOREMAN
For the Daily
If you absolutely need a date
movie or you just have an undying
love for romantic comedies, "Play-
ing For Keeps"
is exactly what (_
you need (and
just in time Playing for
for Hanuk- Keeps
kah!). For any-
one missing At Quality 16
"SportsCen- and Rave
ter" to see this
movie, there's FilmDistrict
the addedbonus
of an on-set Stan Verrett cameo
(But don't be afraid, American
sports fans: ESPN's expansion of
soccer coverage is completely fic-
tional).
"Playing" has a solid cast
infused with plenty of Hollywood:
beauty, but it's just another in a
never-ending string of products
from the industry's assembly line
for love stories.
George (Gerard Butler, "300")
and Stacie (Jessica Biel, "I Now

PronounceYouChuck and Larry")
were the loves of each others'
lives, but his past immaturity and
unfaithfulness drove them apart.
A retired soccer superstar fallen
on hard economic times, George
has moved to be closer to her and
their son, who desperately wants
to have fun with his dad.
When a movie like this is done
well enough to stand out, the con-
nection the audience feels to the
relationships on screen makes
it appealing. Unfortunately, this
isn't one of those stand-outs.
"Playing for Keeps" has too much
going on to allow for any one inti-
macy to develop into more than a
cliche.
Butler is somewhat charm-
ing (and shit, accents are sexy),
but he isn't quite able to capture
the heart of the audience (a little
"300"-style shirt-popping could
have helped here). Biel is convinc-
ing enough as a concerned moth-
er, but her character has little
more depth than being George's
"one that got away." Dennis Quaid
("Parent Trap") and Uma Thur-
man ("KilFlBill") are the best of
the supporting cast, turning in
charismatic performances as a
philandering and wealthy couple
that takes a special interest in
George. And only Dennis Quaid

can turn a group of soccer moms
and dads into a crowd hyped for
fttbol sharpshooting.
What makes "Playing For
Keeps" an underwhelming
film is lazy screenwriting. For
example, George, the coach of
his son's soccer team, is run-
ning along the sidelines engaged
in the game and he's suddenly
interrupted by a phone call
from a player's mom. Of course,
he answers his phone, missing
his son's first career goal. The
idea that any phone call must be
answered serves well in creat-
ing awkward, problematic and
sometimes humorous situations
on screen. However, it also takes
away from the film's realism,
adding drama to the story where
there would have been none in
real life. The film's few attempts
at one-liner comedy are giggle-
some, not hilarious.
That being said, "Playing For
Keeps" is exactly what viewers
should expect it to be - cute. Yes,
you've seen this movie before. Yes,
you know how it ends. But let's
be honest, that's why you would
want to see this movie in the first
place. Because just like a kayak
on Christmas mo-ning, you know
what you're getting before you
unwrap it.

By PAIGE PFLEGER
For the Daily
Humans seem to have a pretty
rocky history when it comes to
knowing when to call it quits,
and America's television indus-
try isn't exempt. Some excellent
TV shows have gotten the end
date just right: "Buffy the Vam-
pire Slayer" retired precisely
when it was about to exceed the
apocalypse quota for one televi-
sion show, and "The West Wing"
respectively retired Jed Bartlet
and left the presidential legacy in
the hands of the likable Matthew
Santos.
Then, on the opposite end of
the spectrum, there are those
shows that ended way too quick-
ly, existing as one-season gems
everyone regrets not paying more
attention to. "Freaks and Geeks" .
is almost a perfect '90s TV show
equivalent to "Breakfast Club,"
dealing with angst-ridden teens
and the relatively trivial difficul-
ties they face in high school. The
show, lasting only one season,
featured such notables as James
Franco, Seth Rogen and Jason
Segel in some of their first televi-
sion roles, and its disappearance is
a television travesty. Along those
lines, there is also the genius and
quirkily morbid show, "Pushing
Daisies," about a pie maker who

can bring dead people back to life tragic scene in which Izzie cries
to solve their murders. The show over the dead body of patient
had an almost Wes Anderson-like Denny ... mostly there was alot of
qualityto it - odd, but in the most dying, and a lot of crying. Howev-
endearing and likable way. er, slowly but surely these deaths
beganto compete with each other
for the most ridiculous, or the
most impactful. And the creators
ran out of people to kill and ways
youjustnee tokill them, resulting in a string of

pull the plug. the shooting/massacre and then,
most recently, the plane crash.

TV REVIEW
Gloomy ending for 'Girl'

Charaters are losing
their grip, the plot
is losing its sanity
By KELLY ETZ
Daily TV/New Media Editor
Way back in 2007, the world
was welcomed to the Upper East
Side (thanks, Kristen Bell) and
the most love-
able group of C
spoiled society
darlings this Gossip Girl
TV generation
has ever known. Season Six
"Gossip Girl" Midseason
is based way too Mondays at 9 p.m.
loosely - where
are Jenny's TheCW
huge breasts? -
on the best-selling series of nov-
els. It's like an upper-crust version
of "Friends," only these six love
nothing more than to secretly (or
not-so-secretly) backstab, lie and
fornicate all over each other. In
the midst of an economic banking
crisis, who knew watching self-
indulgence at its highest caliber
would be so satisfying?
As the "Gossip Girl" gang has
matured from lusty teenagers
with daddy issues (lots and lots
of daddly issues) to college-bound
freshman with bigger dreams
and bigger schemes, to a dysfunc-
tional group of misfits - who all
awkwardly stopped going to col-
lege without explanation - we've
loved them at every step. But
even the love of a guilty pleasure
can't withstand everything that
is wrong with "Gossip Girl" 's
farewell season.
The plot is holier than a cheap
pair of nylons (or anything Serena
wears, ever), while characters are
so far out of character that we
don't even recognize them. Not
even the Brooklynites are making
sense anymore.
Chuck (Ed Westwick) and
Blair (Leighton Meester) can't be
together because they made an
all-important pact in Monte Carlo
after hot hotel sex? That's even
worse than Blair's season five pact
with God. For God's sake (sorry,
Blair), the two have been dancing

THE cw

"Didn't the dress code specifically say 'no safari chic?'"

around each other since the infa-
mous deflowered-in-a-limo scene,
and yet they still can't put their
neuroses aside and make it work.
If anything is going to hold them
back, it should be sturdier than a
nebulous threat from a back-from-
the-dead (really, why?) Bart Bass
(Robert John Burke).
Then there's Serena's (Blake
Lively) - can she commit to any-
one? - fling with Steven (Barry
Watson! What are you doing
here?), a guy who's old enough to
have a 17-year-old daughter and
who has slept with Serena's moth-
er. Gross, even for Serena stan-
dards. At least Serena and Dan
(Pen Badgley) might find a way
to be together if Dan would quit
mooning over Blair and wasting
his writing talents on alienating
exposes. As if you weren't lonely
enough already, Dan. If the two
kind-of-step-siblings - does this
relationship strike anyone else as
a little incestuous? - can make it
work, they might just end upbeing
the Ross and Rachel of the series.
Take that, Chuck and Blair.
Poor old Nate (Chace Craw-
ford) is having money problems at
the Spectator, the tabloid that he
runs (really believable, especially

since he never went to college),
and inevitable relationship prob-
lems with the terribly written and
useless Sage (Steven's daughter!
Even more believable). Nate hasn't
been in the forefront of the show
since season one, and it doesn't
look like things are changing any-
time soon. For a main character,
he really doesn't get to do any-
thing except the requisite man-
whore and best friend duties.
At least the parents' lives are
even more fucked up than their
kids, with Lily (Kelly Rutherford)*
morphing into a semi-villain pit-
ted against Chuck and manipulat-
ed by Bart. Come on, Lily, we had
more faith in you than that, even
with the whole you-sent-Ben-to-
prison-when-you-knew-he-was-
innocent-the-whole-time thing.
Then there's the not-that-con-
vincing arc during which "kept"
husband Rufus (Matthew Settle)
supposedly fallsvictim to atotally
inappropriate affair with the may-
be-she's-evil Ivy (Kaylee DeFer).
Side note: That whole Ivy/Char-
lie/Lola kid swap was so poorly
executed it wasn't palatable inthe
show or in real life, though it's still
unclear whether the writers actu-
ally fell asleep on the job.

And William (William Bald-
win) is just all over the place, per
usual. At least Jack Bass (Desmond
Harrington) is still the loveably
terrible carouser who steals every
scene, even though he might be
Chuck's maybe-father. Better than
the overblown Bart in any case.
It seems "Gossip Girl" couldn't
keep up with all those interweav-
ing plot threads and tied itself
into one too many knots to be
salvageable. With the upcoming
two-hour series finale almost here
- we can't believe it either - the
answers will supposedly be sup-
plied, along with the spectacular
unveiling of the real Gossip Girl.
Why the network decided to
do an abbreviated season for the
show's final farewell we'll never
know, besides the fact that abbre-
viated seasons seem to be wildly
popular this year. It feels insuffi-
cient for a series that walked the
line between drama and soap so
perfectly to go out without the
requisite fanfare. One can only
hope that the last episodes of the
season manage to turn every-
thing around, pull out all the
stops and end on a high. "Gossip
Girl" fans deserve no less.
RIP XOXO.

that read "The Blind Pig."
I hadn't anticipated doing
my homework at the Blind Pig,
but the. fact remained that it
was finals week and I had some
downtime before my band - our
band - Palisades, went on for
Showcase Night. Of course, my
bandmates and I had had our
giddy moments of holy shit, we're
playing at the Blind Pig - famous
people have played here! But the
venue was pretty much empty
except for the other three bands
there for Showcase Night.
The first group that went on
was a folk band with a healthy
dose of facial hair, quaintly cute
dresses and banjos. It involved
two female leads that sang with
grace and confidence, one of
whom apparently accompanies
Ann Arbor's Violin Monster as
Little Red Riding Hood. Their
set was fantastic, but I still
didn't have the lyrics for our new
song - which remains entitled
"New Song," or "Newson" if you
announce it really quickly under
your breath to the audience - so
unfortunately I had to spend the
majority of their set huddled in a
corner, directing my cell phone
light toward my chest as I typed
out lyrics.
Then it was our turn to play,

rock out.
We started off the show with
our sunniest song - a surfy
thing called "Float Away" that
was initially inspired by the
Great Pacific Garbage Patch but,
as most of our stuff tends to do,
ended up turning into a love
song. When I began singing, my
voice was stiff and shaky, and I
grabbed the microphone as if to
stabilize myself - which prob-
ably just made me look absolute-
ly terrified. I've sang this song
plenty of times, so I was able
focus on things like what thefuck
do people in bands do with their
hands when they sing? rather
than remembering the words.
After that show, the audi-
ence (read: my friends) cheered
madly, and I was extremely
pleased to see that we had a
legitimate crowd who came to
see us play. I introduced us as
Palisades, and asked if Michael
Ho, our friend/roadie was in the
crowd. He was.

John Beilein stressed the impor-

fast-paced attack - something
Michigan struggled with in a
two-point loss to the Razorbacks
last season - with a good transi-
tion game of its own.
The third-ranked Wolverines
proved their endurance in Tues-
day's win over Western Michigan,
but on Saturday, they didn't have
to rely as much on transition as
Beilein predicted. Instead, Michi-
gan outmuscled Arkansas in the
post to secure an 80-67 win.
Redshirt junior forward Jor-
dan Morgan scored six of the
Wolverines' first nine points and
finished with his second career
double-double - 12 points, 10
rebounds, both season-highs - to

lead a complete all-around game
by Michigan's big men.
Freshman forward Mitch
McGary and redshirt sophomore
Jon Horford filled in nicely off the
bench for Morgan, adding a com-
bined six points, nine rebounds
and four blocks.
Morgan, who had arguably
his best game of the season on
Saturday, had a similar perfor-
mance against Arkansas last
season, when he put up 16 points
and six rebounds. His energy
and physicality was unmatched
by the Razorback bigs. Arkansas
was outrebounded by Michigan,

Beilein and his boys have staying power

John Beilein has always built
his teams to maximize the
talent on the roster. He's
just never had this much to work
with before - never this much

game to a
dominating
performance on the boards.
Beilein, a teacher-firstkind of
coach, is known for finding raw
role players and cultivatingthem
into legitimate college ballplayers.
But now, thanks to a blockbuster
freshman class and the return
of sophomore guard Trey Burke,
Beilein isn't looking down the
bench at walk-ons or overachiev-
ers; he's got talent stockpiled.
There's somethingspecial
going on down at Crisler Center.
Michigan is off to a 9-0 start for
the first time since 1988-89 - the
Wolverines' last and only national
championship season - and the
third time in program history. In
five of those wins, Michigan has
led from start to finish.
Michigan hasn't lost at home -
or anywhere, I suppose - this fall,
and is 21-1 at Crisler in the last
two seasons.
It doesn't look anything like
a traditional Beilein team. But
that's fine by him.
Gone are the days of living

two of those high scorers are true
freshmen.
Not easy.
Beilein has always been a coach
hell-bent on rotating players to
keep a fresh five on the floor. In
the past, the depth hasn't been
there. Today, there's plenty of it.
And even better: nobody is a one-
dimensional player.
Instead of defensive specialists,
3-point threats or ball handlers,
Beilein has a litany of steady, well-
versed options. Just look at the
five freshmen. If they were one-
dimensional players, they'd be
riding through a redshirt season.
But Beilein burned any possible
redshirts - he knows they're
ready.
Nik Stauskas is a dead-eye
shooter, No. 4 nationally at 60.5
percent from 3-point range, but he
can get to the rim. Spike Albrecht
can dribble around you, but he
can beat you from deep. Mitch
McGary might be raw offensively,
but he's a monster on the glass.
"With Michigan, just about
every guy who gets minutes can
do it all," Titus wrote. "It not only
makes them damn near impos-
sible to stop, it also makes them
fun to watch."
Fun to watch - not a roller-
coaster, not an adventure. Fun.

By CINDY YU
For the Daily
On Friday, the No. 10 Michi-
gan women's gymnastics team
proved that this year's team was
ready for redemption after barely
missing the NCAA Champion-
ships last season.
With
an entire- MSU 191.100
ly healthy UM 195.375
squad, no
graduated seniors and four new
freshmen, the Wolverines beat
Michigan State in an exhibition
meet, 195.375-191.100.
"Our team chemistry and
energy that we have on the team
this year is phenomenal," said
Michigan coach Bev Plocki. "I
think that the adversity that we
went through last year definitely
made us stronger, made us closer
and made us better."
Michigan swept the podium in
the all-around and the individual
events. Senior co-captain Katie
Zurales won the all-around title
with a 39.225, sophomore Sachi
Sugiyama took second in the ill-
around with a 39.200 and junior
co-captain Joanna Sampson fin-
ished third with a 38.500.
"It's great to get out in Crisler

Arena," Zurales said. "It's a good
confidence booster. You know
at the beginning of the season
knowing that our routines are
together and they're there, just
little perfection things here on
out."
In the first rotation, the Wol-
verines earned a 49.300 on vault
to take the lead over Michigan
State's 47.875 on bars. Sampson
tied her career high for the event
with a 9.950 and Zurales contrib-

On uneven bars, all six Michi-
gan competitors scored above
a 9.775. Zurales and Sugiyama
tied for first, scoring 9.850. After
both the vault and bar rotations
finished, Michigan increased its
lead over the Spartans to 98.450-
96.275. Freshman Lindsay Wil-
liams also made her debut on
Friday and scored a 9.775 on bars.

from four inches wide down to
about two inches wide when you
go under pressure."
Michigan finished the meet on
floor with a 48.825 and Sugiyama
won another title with a 9.850.
The loudest applause of the night,
though, went to senior Natalie
Beilstein when she electrified
the audience with an upbeat rou-
tine that marked her comeback
(though she did compete on the
uneven bars earlier in the night,
floor was her signature event)
from a season-ending Achilles'
injury last season. Beilstein took
second with a 9.800 and junior
Stephanie Colbert finished third
with a 9.775.
"I think we did really well,"
Sugiyama said. "We still have
some room for improvement. We
just need to work under pres-
sure more inside the gym but I
thinkthis year was a much better
improvement from last year."
Added Plocki: "I think we're
goingto see a lot of pay-offs from
that this year. I've got a great
group of young women and I'm
very proud of them."

in intrasquad opener

By ALEX TAYLOR
Daily Sports Writer
The slogan is omnipresent for
the No. 2 Michigan men's gym-
nastics team, located on banners,
signs and past championship
rings.
"Handle Everything," it reads.
And it might have been on best
display on Friday night.
With two of its top gymnasts
dealing with injuries, Michigan
still performed well at its annual
Maize and Blue intrasquad meet.
"I was pretty pleased with it,"
said Michigan coach Kurt Golder.
"They showed me something that
I've known all along,that they can
be a really, really good team this
year."
The Maize team came up on
top, winning 330.20-328.80.
Fifth-year senior Syque Caesar
and sophomore Adrian de los
Angeles led the Maize team while
sophomore Stacey Ervin, junior
Sam Mikulak and senior Rohan
Sebastian highlighted the Blue
squad. Ervin turned in one of the
best performances of the night on
floor exercise. An All-American

on floor and vault last season, he'
scored a 15.75, beating his per-
sonal best of 15.600 fromlast year.
"I was stoked," said Ervin. "I've
been working real hard all sum-
mer and it's been great training
for this. Warm-ups were a little
shaky so I went extra hard in the
competition and it definitely paid
off."
Ervin logged the highest score
of the night on vault with a 14.88.
Even more impressive, though,
was the fact that these perfor-
mances were done while nurs-
ing injuries. Also hampered by
injuries was Mikulak, who only
participated in the rings. Even
with his balky ankle, he scored
a 14.15, the second-highest score
on the night for rings. Mikulak
had ankle problems over the sum-
mer that had recently healed, but
shortly after returning, he tore a
calf muscle in practice.
If this intrasquad meet was a
small precursor for the season,
the Wolverines might find them-
selves having to stare at the words
"Handle Everything" for a very
long time - on new championship
rings.

off strong for the Wolverines,
earning a technical fall to give'
Michigan five points. A pin by
165-pound Michigan freshman
Taylor Massa gave the Wolver-

Apland's pin in under three min-

Apland said.
"I can go out there and have
fun like I try to do and I'm going

Michigan continued after a
15-minute intermission as it hit
the mat against the Eagles. After
a technical fall by 149-pound
redshirt junior Eric Grajales, the
Wolverines took a commanding
14-0 lead. Many new and differ-
ent faces scored for Michigan,
with redshirt sophomore Chris

Heald winning his first match

Apland's second pin of the day in
just 53 seconds capped off a 32-3

Although the final scores
showed that the Wolverines won
with ease, the coaching staff
wanted the wrestlers to focus as
if the dual meets were tight.
"Whether we've got abig lead
in the dual or whether it's a tight
dual, we need to be focusing on
the same things from match to

Whether Michigan has a big

knows it will have Apland avail-
able in the 285-pound position,
ready to close the door on more
Wolverine victories.

his way. When he's got that, we're
a much better team."
The Wolverines didn't plan to
look inside for offensive produc-
tion but the frontcourt provided
more than half of Michigan's
offense. The Wolverines tallied
42 points in the paint even though
Morgan took just nine shots and
McGary six. Many of Michigan's
points came from put-backs.
Not typically a rebounding
team, the Wolverines pulled down
a season-high 18 offensive boards
and scored 15 second-chance
points. Morgan had six of the 18
offensive rebounds and was often
found in position under the basket
for an easy lay-in.
"With the ball screen offenses
that everybody employs there's
pressure on the rim a lot of dif-
ferent ways and there's rebound-
ing angles," Beilein said. "You're
going to have some muckers that
are going to go get the loose ones.
Mitch and Jon and Jordan make
a huge difference in that. It's rare
for one of our teams to do that....
You need guys to get in there and
attack the rim and get offensive
rebounds."
The most important part of the
forwards' game, though, was lim-
iting the Razorbacks' extra pos-
sessions. Beilein said Michigan's
defensive rebounding slowed
down Arkansas' transition, saying
the energy Morgan and McGary
brought to Saturday's game was
integral in slowing down the
Razorbacks' fast-paced game plan.
Michigan hasn't had a signifi-
cant post presence in past years
and that was a hole that needed
filling if Beilein wanted to have a
complete team this season.
With the addition of a taller
McGary to complement a strong
Morgan, the Michigan coach is
happy with how the frontcourt is
developing.
"Most of the big guys we've
found there's a steady progress
until they really get it and then
they'll make a bigger jump,"
Beilein said. "You've seen it with
Jon, you've seen it with Jordan,
and (now Mitch is) just making
steady progress."


MICHIGAN

sas outside an arm's reach, but
Mike Anderson's team swung
back. A fast start to the second
half shrunk a 10-point halftime
deficit to one by midway through
the frame.
"What I really like, is that we
did respond during that time,"
Beilein said. "And we didn't
respond with some pretty play.
We got gutty, garbage buckets
that made the difference and
then hit a big three."
The game mirrored last year's
contest in Fayetteville when it
was the Razorbacks to jump out
to a fast start. Michigan chipped
into the lead throughout the
second half before falling short
at the end, 66-64.
But whereas the Wolverines
kept it close until the final pos-
session last year, they shut down
the Razorbacks' comeback
emphatically on Saturday.
FINAL FOUR
From Page 1B
only unseeded team remaining
in the Elite Eight, the Wolverines
were never expected to mount a
comeback, but they did.
Both teams came out aggres-
sive in the set, but it was the
Cardinal's blocking that caught
Michigan off-guard. Sophomore
setter Lexi Dannemiller followed
her game plan, isolating Erwin
and junior outside hitter Molly
Toon. But the pair continually
found themselves stuffed at the
net on several swings. When they
did manage to hit it around the
wall, there was a Stanford defen-
sive specialist waiting to pass.
The Wolverines, benefitting
from a strong freshman squad,
met an equally impressive fresh-
man group from Stanford. With
the score tied at eight, a balanced
Cardinal front led by freshman
middle blocker Inky Ajanaku
went on a 6-0 run to grab a com-
fortable lead and eventually close
out the set.
The Wolverines refused to
stop challenging Stanford's
blocking scheme in the second
set and raced out to a 16-10 lead,
capped by a kill from right-side
hitter Claire McElheny. Four-
teen of the Wolverines' first 16
points came on kills.
Despite the Cardinal's two
errors in the set, Michigan con-
tinued to score, winding up for
kill after kill. The Wolverines
coasted through the remainder
of the second set, even as Stan-
ford fought them off.
"We're a very balanced team
and that's something we pride
ourselves on," Cross said. "It was
really about attacking the quick
tempo and then spreading out
and giving our outsides an open
space to hit."
Cross finished second on
the team with 15 kills after her
strong effort the previous night.
Toon followed with 12 kills and
McElheny with 1L
Following back-and-forth play
from both teams in the third set,
Michigan opened up a lead on a
6-1 run. Stanford took a timeout
but it was ineffective at slowing
down a team that had no trouble

responding to a powerful Car-
dinal. defense. The Wolverines
cruised through the remain-

"I think that's a sign of a good
team," said sophomore point
guard Trey Burke. "It got down
to aone-possessiongame,butwe
never broke, we never cracked
and we stayed together."
With just under four minutes
left, Burke was fouled while
shooting a 3-pointer as the shot
clock expired. He made two of
the free throws to give Michi-
gan a comfortable 68-59 edge.
From there, it was easy. The
Wolverines continued to stifle
the Razorbacks (4-4) on defense
and flourished in transition late
in the game, turning that one-
point lead into a 17-point advan-
tage. Burke made a difficult,
falling-down bank shot in the
final minute and followed that
with a ferocious fastbreak, two-
handed dunk - one in which he
was assessed a technical foul for
hanging on the rim.
."I haven't seen that in a long
time," Beilein said about the
call.
Redshirt junior forward Jor-
der of the set, riding a wave of
momentum into the final.
With a two-set lead to boot,
Michigan looked like the team
that had been in this situation
before, the team that knew how
to close out big games in the
fourth set. Trailing 10-9, the
Wolverines put together a 5-0
run, leaving Stanford looking
drained and sullen.
Leading 15-13, Michigan
needed one final run to crush
anythought of a comeback in the
fourth set. The Wolverines did
so with a 4-0 run, which ulti-
mately allowed them to cruise to
a match point, which Erwin fin-
ished off with an emphatic kill.
The Wolverines, the team that
wasn't predicted to be celebrat-
ing, celebrated. They smiled as
they had all season, as even the
coaches knew they had accom-
plished somethingspecial.
Freshman libero Tiffany
Morales, playing in front of
friends and family in her home
state, bailed out Michigan when
it needed her most. The Redondo
Beach, Calif. native tallied 22
digs on a night where she was all
over the court.
Erwin, too, found herself
doing more than hitting, contrib-
uting 16 digs of her own.
"Tiffany's progression has
been great," Rosen said. "I
thought last night she did an out-
standing job of just positioning
herself and making great defen-
sive plays, and she definitely car-
ried that through tonight. She's
been a huge defensive force for
us."
It's likely Michigan, a team
without a real star, will once
again be underdogs when it trav-
els to Louisville to face the Long-
horns.
But that underdog mindset
- doesn't exist anymore.
"It doesn't matter because
we're such a great team," Erwin
said. "We don't need our names
out there because no matter what
teams throw at us, 14 people are
coming at them."
They've done it to No. 9 Louis-
ville and No. 2 Stanford, so why
not again?
"We might not be the biggest
names or the highest profile, but
I think this a team that is playing
as well as anybody in the country

right now," Rosen said. "And I'm
excited aboutthat."

dan Morgan was the Wolver-
ines' rock early. With no one on
Arkansas to match his physical-
ity, he scored six of Michigan's
first nine points, drew a charge
and was a menace on the offen-
sive, glass all game.
He finished with 12 points
and 10 rebounds - six of them
offensive - to rack up his sec-
ond double-double in a week.
With the help of the rest of
the frontcourt, the Wolverines
outrebounded the Razorbacks
42-26. Eighteen of those came
on the offensive glass.
"They were so good in transi-
tion, we wanted to limit them,"
Morgan said. "By getting offen-
sive rebounds, they weren't get-
ting defensive rebounds to get
out and run."
Morgan was a big part of
the Wolverines' stout interior
defense that kept Arkansas from
evening up the game in the sec-
ond half. Redshirt sophomore
Jon Horford was also instru-
mental in shutting down the

Arkansas frontcourt, racking up
three blocks.
BJ Young and Marshawn
Powell accounted for all of the
Arkansas scoring early. It wasn't
until six minutes remained in
the first half that a third Razor-
back scored, when walk-on
Kikko Haydar took command
of Arkansas's offense. His 9
points - he had scored six com-
bined this season until Saturday
- kept the Razorbacks within
shouting distance to finish the
half.
"We didn't know who he is,"
Beilein said about the 5-foot-
10 junior. "I thought he walked
in off the street. What a great
story."
Beilein was happy about his
100th win, and he hopes that the
worst has passed with his time
at Michigan. With a team like
he has this year, those wins may
come faster.
"I certainly hope the next 100
at Michigan are easier than the
first 100," Beilein said.
