On Saturday afternoon, more 
than 50 high school students, 
residents and local politicians 
gathered in Liberty Plaza in 
downtown Ann Arbor to demand 
legislative 
action 
against 
gun 
violence. The Washtenaw Youth 
Initiative, a local group led by and 
composed of high school students, 
organized the rally. They invited 
U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., 
and state Rep. Yousef Rabhi, D-Ann 
Arbor, to speak at the event, as well 
as activists from the gun violence 
advocacy groups Moms Demand 
Action for Gun Sense in America 
and Physicians for the Prevention 
of Gun Violence.
The 
Washtenaw 
Youth 
Initiative is composed of students 
from 12 different high schools in 

Washtenaw 
County 
according 
to the website. The group meets 
weekly in the Neutral Zone, a 
teen center in downtown Ann 
Arbor, and has approximately 50 
members.
Claire Robinson, a junior at 
Pioneer High School and an 
active WYI member, said the rally 
was primarily aimed at bringing 
together high school students.
“No one else has honestly 
been bringing about change,” 
Robinson said. “But we’ve been 
working really hard and still have 
high schoolers across the country 
(organizing), like March For Our 
Lives and Parkland, and I think 
that that’s starting to bring about 
change.”

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer will 
be delivering the University of 
Michigan’s spring commencement 
address 
for 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 
campus. Additionally, Nobel Prize 
winner Randy Schekman will 
be delivering the address for the 
Rackham Graduate School events. 
The Board of Regents will approve 
the honorary degree recipients 
for spring commencement during 
their upcoming March 28 meeting.
Whitmer 
is 
a 
lifelong 
Michigander who was elected 
as Michigan’s 49th governor in 
November 2018 after previously 
serving in the state House of 
Representatives 
from 
2001-06 
and state Senate from 2006-
2015. Her address will make 
her the sixth sitting governor 

to speak at a commencement in 
the past 40 years. Her legislative 
achievements included an increase 
in the minimum wage with a cost-
of-living adjustment and health 
coverage expansion to more than 
680,000 residents.
Additionally, 
Whitmer 
has 
taught at the University, as well as 
at Michigan State University. 
Kellie Lounds, Public Policy 
senior and former chair of College 
Democrats, 
told 
The 
Daily 
Whitmer’s presence could send a 
powerful message.
“Personally, I’m thrilled that 
Governor Whitmer will be our 
commencement speaker,” Lounds 
wrote in an text message. “College 
Dems campaigned hard for her 
in the fall and it’s been incredible 
to see her hit the ground running 
in her efforts to set Michigan 
on the right track and make it a 

state that works for everyone. 
Governor 
Whitmer’s 
presence 
at our commencement also has 
the potential to send a powerful 
message about how critical our 
public universities are to the 
success of our state and about the 
importance she places on making 
Michigan a state where college 
graduates want to stay and grow 
for the long term.”
Along with receiving the Nobel 
Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 
Scheckman is also a professor 
of 
cell 
and 
developmental 
biology at the University of 
California, Berkeley. His research 
investigates the mechanism of 
protein traffic in the secretory 
pathway in eukaryotic cells. 

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer outlined 
her plan to increase funding for 
education and repair Michigan’s 
roads with a hike in fuel taxes in 
her 2020 budget, an effort to follow 
through on her campaign promise 
to “fix the damn roads.” The 
recommendation, which Whitmer 
presented to the state legislature 
on Tuesday, calls for raising the 
motor fuel tax by $0.45 per gallon, 
increasing an estimated $2.5 billion 
a year.
Whitmer told state lawmakers 
the tax hike was necessary to fund 
the repairs but recognized the cost 
was “too great to bear in one fell 
swoop,” instead opting for three 
subsequent $0.15 increases to be 
implemented from Oct. 1, 2019 to 
Oct. 1, 2020. 
“There’s no doubt that the 
enormity 
of 
this 
problem 
is 
staggering,” Whitmer said. “If 
we’re going to solve these problems, 
if we expect anyone to invest in 
Michigan, we’ve got to invest in 
ourselves, and I have a plan that will 
get us to 90 percent of state roads in 
good or fair condition by 2030.”

control rally

ANN ARBOR

The Washtenaw Youth Initiative held 
the event, invited U.S. and State reps

MARIA SOBRINO 
Daily Staff Reporter

By its own admission with data 
from 2017, the University of Michigan 
consumes a “substantial” amount 
of energy, making a net-zero carbon 
footprint a tall order, especially given 
the University’s relatively late arrival 
to tackling climate change. 
After announcing plans to pursue 

a path to carbon neutrality in 
October, University President Mark 
Schlissel launched a commission on 
Feb. 4 to develop recommendations 
for achieving sustainability. Campus 
climate activists welcomed the 
commission, which is composed of 
faculty, students and administrators, 
as well as local officials and 
environmentalists.
Engineering junior Logan Vear, 
president of the Climate Action 
Movement, supported the creation 

of the commission, but worried 
about conflicts of interest presented 
by the involvement of certain 
members of the newly selected 
group. Vear, who was named 
to one of the commission’s two 
student spots, expressed concern 
about the inclusion of Brandon 
Hofmeister, senior vice president 
of governmental, regulatory and 
public affairs at CMS Energy and 
Consumers Energy, as well as Camilo 
Serna, vice president of corporate 

strategy at DTE Energy.
“(It was) highly disappointing 
that DTE and Consumers Energy 
were given spots on the commission 
itself instead of potentially in an 
advisory panel, given their history of 
fighting against climate policy, their 
advocating for natural gas expansion 
and 
particularly 
their 
direct 
conflict of interest being financially 
dependent upon U of M,” Vear said.

Beginning in fall 2019, the 
University of Michigan’s Ross 
School of Business will launch a 
part-time, online MBA program, 
making the school the first top-10 
business school in the country to 
offer an online degree alternative.
The Business School currently 
runs weekend and evening MBA 
programs for professionals who 
are unable to commit to the full-
time MBA track. These part-time 
programs allow students to both 
work full-time and earn their 
degrees but require students to 
be in close proximity to the Ann 
Arbor campus.
Wallace Hopp, the director 
of part-time programs at the 
Business 
School, 
said 
the 
increased accessibility will enable 
the program to reach a wider and 
more diverse cohort of students. 
The program is currently only 
offered to students in the U.S. but 
can accommodate travel or study 
abroad plans more easily than the 
weekend or evening MBA tracks, 
which demand more face-to-face 
contact between professors and 
students.
“We’re not backing away from 
(the weekend MBA program) 
at all,” Hopp said. “We’re not 
replacing that program. (The 
online program) is for the people 
who don’t have a family situation 
or a career situation where they 
can get to Ann Arbor every 
other weekend. They might be 
traveling, they might be doing 
their study from South America 
or wherever — it doesn’t matter, 

because they’re able to access 
this.”
According 
to 
Hopp, 
the 
business school faculty officially 
voted to approve the creation 
of the online MBA program in 
February 2018. Hopp said prior 
to the vote, the business school 
administration had been lobbying 
to create the program for nearly 
two years. 
“To get to that point, of course, 
we had done a lot of work to 
have a concrete proposal for the 
faculty to evaluate,” Hopp said. 
Although the online MBA 
program 
will 
not 
require 
students to convene in Ann 
Arbor every other week for 
class, Anne Schoen, the associate 
admissions director for part-
time MBA programs, said the 
admissions committee will hold 
applicants to the same standards 
as all of the Business School 
programs. Schoen said the ideal 
student would have between 
five and seven years of working 
experience in the business field, 
an average undergraduate GPA of 
3.4 and a GRE score between 158 
and 160 out of 170 possible points 
for both the quantitative and 
verbal sections. 
“From 
an 
admissions 
standpoint, application is the 
same, requirements are the same 
and standards are the same,” 
Schoen said. “So there’s nothing 
different that we’re looking for 
from this population of students 
that we wouldn’t normally look 
for in a traditional student.”

University carbon neutrality effort 
features allies with cloudy records 

Two members in the new commission are executives at DTE and Consumers Energy

DESIGN BY ALICE HUTH


University spokeswoman Kim 
Broekhuizen said the commission 
sought 
to 
include 
diverse 
perspectives from various fields of 
expertise in its mission to achieve 
carbon neutrality, noting DTE and 
Consumers’ pledge to incorporate 
more renewable energy sources into 
their portfolios.
“It is absolutely critical for the 
energy industry to be a part of 
U-M’s exploration of scalable and 
transferable solutions given the 
fact that these companies are the 
number one energy providers/
sources for our region and state,” 
Broekhuizen wrote in an email. 
“In addition, they have each made 
their own renewables commitment 
and 
are 
engaged 
in 
strategy 
development that will be useful to 
our own efforts.”
The first town hall of the 
President’s Commission on Carbon 
Neutrality on is expected to draw 
a capacity crowd at Rackham 
Auditorium on Monday night. 
Broekhuizen said the commission is 

intent on getting feedback from the 
University community.
“Community 
input 
also 
is 
critical to the development of the 
recommendations,” 
Broekhuizen 
wrote. 
“The 
commission 
is 
creating several advisory panels 
– representing students, faculty, 
university partners and external 
stakeholders – to provide various 
perspectives and expertise, and 
to serve as a forum for connecting 
with key stakeholder groups.”
Hofmeister and Serna, on the 
other hand, see their roles on the 
commission in a positive light, 
saying they feel they can work to 
ensure the commission is able to not 
only plan but achieve and carry out 
their carbon neutrality goals. 
Both are well-versed in the 
energy 
industry.A 
former 
law 
professor at Wayne State University, 
Hofmeister published an article 
in 
the 
Michigan 
Journal 
of 
Environmental and Administrative 
Law in 2012 discussing the benefits 
and drawbacks of state energy 
regulators acting as “potential 
climate change regulators.” 
Serna 
was 
previously 
vice 

president for strategic planning 
and policy for Eversource Energy, 
New 
England’s 
largest 
utility 
company, and before that, Serna 
worked for Oliver Wyman’s Energy 
& Utilities management consulting 
practice, consulting utility and 
energy companies in Europe, Latin 
America and North America. 
Serna 
said 
the 
University’s 
relationship with DTE would 
enable the utility to be a crucial 
partner 
in 
achieving 
carbon 
neutrality. 
He 
said 
Schlissel 
recognized this dynamic.
“As I understand, the President 
was thinking about this goal of 
carbon neutrality and what that 
might mean for the University 
when he started interacting with 
different folks here within DTE,” 
Serna said. “He understands that 
we as an energy provider to the 
University are going to be a critical 
partner as he thinks through how to 
reach this goal of carbon neutrality, 
so in those discussions he solicited 
for help through DTE.”
Serna said his experience in the 
energy industry perspective would 
offer the commission a valuable 
perspective.
“I can imagine we’ll provide 
our perspective on where we as 
a company, DTE, (are) headed, 
what type of programs we have 
now or we might have in the 
future that could support the 
University in achievement of 
this goal,” Serna said. “I see my 
role … as being able to provide 
that industry perspective as to 
what’s happening in the energy 
landscape, what’s happening 
with DTE and how those could 
be of help to the University in 
achieving its ultimate goal of 
achieving carbon neutrality.”
Hofmeister said Consumers’ 
drive 
for 
environmental 
sustainability is one of the 
forces behind his motivation to 
aid the Commission in its goals 
for carbon neutrality.
“The 
University 
is 
an 
important stakeholder in the 
state of Michigan,” he said. 
“Consumers Energy cares a lot 
about the state of Michigan; 
we care about our customers ... 
Whether it’s greenhouse gas or 
other sustainability missions, 
we want to work as partners 
to enable the customers vision. 

We ourselves have a pretty strong 
commitment 
to 
environmental 
sustainability and are pretty well 
versed in energy related issues to 
the extent we can help partner 
with any customer or stakeholder, 
particularly a great Michigan 
institution like the University, 
achieve whatever its goals are.”
According to a 2015 report 
from the President’s Greenhouse 
Gas Reduction Committee, the 
University purchases more than 60 
percent of its electricity needs from 
DTE. CAM founder Julian Hansen, 
an LSA junior, said the utilities 
had a financial stake that could 
negatively affect the outcome of the 
commission.
 “A swift transition to U of M 
carbon neutrality would most likely 
decrease this reliance that we have 
with DTE and therefore that causes 
DTE and Consumers Energy to 
have a financial incentive to slow 
down the transition to carbon 
neutrality,” Hansen said.
Financial 
incentives 
have 
played a major role in power 
utilities’ responses to clean energy 
across the country, which have 
varied from lukewarm to outright 
opposition. In Michigan, DTE 
and Consumers Energy have a 
mixed record on their approach 
to renewable energy. Both have 
pledged to get 25 percent of their 
energy from renewable sources by 
2030, with Consumers announcing 
plans in February 2018 to stop using 
coal to generate electricity by 2040, 
by which time DTE plans to retire 
all of its coal-fired plants.
DTE aims to reduce carbon 
emissions by 80 percent by 2050, 
while Consumers Energy intends 
to cut its emissions by 90 percent 
by 2040, in addition to getting 
40 percent of its energy from 
renewable sources and energy 
storage by the same year. However, 
despite 
these 
commitments, 
environmental groups see room 
for improvement when it comes 
to DTE and Consumers Energy’s 
track records on clean energy, 
taking issue in particular with the 
utilities’ reliance on fossil fuels.

COMMISSION
From Page 1A


I come from an Indian 
family with lovingly obsessive 
parents who will continue 
to baby me even when I’m 
living on my own. One day 
over 
Thanksgiving 
Break, 
my mom drove me to my 
ophthalmologist’s office for 
an annual check-up. She sat 
with me before the doctor 
walked in, and interestingly 
enough, found that it was 
the perfect time for my daily 
career 
counseling 
session. 
We sat there having a ten-
minute 
tête-à-tête. 
She 
constantly prodded me about 
how I would be spending my 
summer, and I constantly 
deflected her questions with 
half-baked placations.
 Our doctor walked into the 
room soon after, saving me 
from the interrogation. Dr. 
Bhatia is a second generation 
Punjabi – he went to college 

in New Orleans, medical 
school in Toledo, and now 
lives in Dallas with his wife 
and two kids. In pretty 
much every respect, he was 
just 
as 
Americanized 
as 
the 
generation 
of 
Indian 
Americans I grew up with. In 
his slightly rolling accent, he 
asked me to give him updates 
on my life. I knew the ultimate 
question was coming, and 
it eventually did after a few 
minutes of small talk. “So… 
any special guy?”
 My laugh was instinctual 
and lasted slightly longer 
than it should have. “Nope, 
you’ll be the first one to know 
if I ever do,” I joked. I heard 
a small sound escape my 
mother’s mouth, but I didn’t 
expect her voice any of her 
concerns. Luckily, my parents 
have always understood my 
career-focused 
future. 
Dr. 
Bhatia, on the other hand, 
seemed 
more 
concerned 
about what he called my 
“biological reality.” I was 

shocked when I heard these 
words come from a man who 
has spent his entire life in the 
States. I almost expected him 
to align with my culturally 
progressive mentality, but he 
approached the topic from 
what he described as a purely 
scientific perspective, though 
he 
was 
obviously 
tinged 
cultural bias. He proceeded 
to discuss how Indian women 
face a specific disadvantage 
because they don’t typically 
seek 
arranged 
marriages; 
men usually approach women 
first, and on the basis of their 
own timelines. While he 
accepted the generalization 
that men usually mature and 
want to settle down later 
than in life that women do, 
he claimed that men who 
seek relationships and focus 
on marriage prospects much 
later than women interfere 
with 
women’s 
biological 
timelines, making it difficult 
to have healthy children at a 
“reasonable age.” Secondly, 

he felt that if women waited 
until they were ready to get 
married (usually, once they 
have settled in their careers), 
there 
would 
realize 
that 
there was a dearth of eligible, 
available men.
 My response to these 
claims: why should we women 
worry about conforming to 
the timelines of men? Dr. 
Bhatia’s assertion came with 
the expectation that we are 
constantly 
stressing 
about 
adhering 
to 
stereotypical 
age ranges to fulfill certain 
life goals, and that some 
goals are always prioritized 
over others. How are Indian 
women supposed to carry 
the onuses of studying well, 
finding lucrative jobs, while 
simultaneously finding a life 
companion, having children, 
and securing their futures as 
well? Why do our overbearing 
parents teach to focus on our 
studies and avoid boys like 
the plague, but then expect 
us to effortlessly navigate our 

relationships when we reach 
the age for marriage? South 
Asian elders seem to instill in 
us a fear of disappointment 
that causes us to act like our 
lives are in pristine order; 
in reality, however, we are 
faced with this paradox that 
hinders our ability to live 
life on our own terms. As an 
Indian American woman – I 
told Dr. Bhatia –I shouldn’t 
have to obligated to take 
on societal commitments I 
am not prepared for, and I 
shouldn’t have to shoulder 
the burden of measuring up 
to such demanding biological 
realities.
 I realized for the first 
time, a little dejectedly, that 
concepts of love, dating, and 
marriage don’t necessarily 
progress through generations. 
Traditional 
family-based 
values 
are 
perpetuated 
regardless of whether we are 
first 
or 
second-generation 
individuals. While I grew 
up learning the importance 

of unity and family, I never 
expected 
that 
the 
idea 
of 
getting 
married 
and 
having kids within a certain 
timeframe would be imposed 
upon me by other second-
generation adults. Hearing 
Dr. Bhatia tell me “Don’t lose 
sleep over it, but just keep 
in in the back of your mind 
because your responsibilities 
will creep up on you” made 
me question the extent to 
which we pride ourselves 
on progress. His comments 
made 
me 
see 
the 
stark 
disparity in the way South 
Asian 
communities 
treat 
females in comparison males 
– it is a disparity that has 
crossed continental borders 
and embedded itself into the 
roots of our society. Its ability 
to permeate diverse cultures 
is not restricted by the soil 
we are on, and that should be 
something we consider in our 
feminist efforts!

Romance and the hidden paradox of second-generation dating

We’ve seen her belt at the top of her lungs to Beyonce’s “Love On 
Top”. We’ve witnessed her serve witty comebacks as Diane in the 
popular hit series “Blackish.” Now we finally get to see this little 
queen achieve greater feats. As if Black History Month couldn’t get 
any better, Marsai Martin is shining a light and reminding us of the 
power, fearlessness and ambition that Black Girl Magic was born 
from.
Not too long ago, Marsai took the internet by storm when it was 
revealed that she officially made history as the youngest Executive 
Producer in Hollywood. For this young queen’s upcoming 
film Little, fourteen years old isn’t looking too shabby.
As if this isn’t enough to give Marsai her well-deserved accolades, 
the entire concept of the film was her idea. When she was only 
11-years old, she pitched her idea to “Blackish” writer Kenya Barris, 
which was all it took for the next door to open. Marsai reported 
that Kenya Barris made the phone call to Will Packer, producer of 
“Girls Trip”, and told him just how dope her idea was.
Tracy Y. Oliver revealed further details from behind the scenes 
regarding the highly anticipated film and its Executive Producer 
on her Instagram. She said, “I went in Universal to do a joint pitch 
with a then 11-year old @marsaimartin for this movie that she 
dreamt up. So young, but so confident. Way more than me. Thank 
you for the honor of writing this movie. Proud of you, girl”. So, not 
only is our beloved Marsai Martin an amazing actress, it seems like 

she’s now a triple threat with more to add to her resume.
Marsai has also managed to successfully nab a production deal 
with Universal Pictures. Her company Genius Productions just 
recently signed a deal with Universal in which she’ll be developing 
her own scripted projects for the company. Her first project with 
Genius Productions is set to be a film called “StepMonster,” which 
is a comedy film similar to her upcoming movie, “Little.” As if it 
were any surprise, Genius Productions already has a few fans 
excited and fellow celebs congratulating Marsai on her astonishing 
accomplishments. Marsai is definitely giving Hollywood what it 
needs as far as comedy, creativity and representation.
Overall, Marsai is not wasting time or even dabbling with the 
idea of limitations. The triple-threat actress is making her mark 
and letting it be known that, despite her age, her boundless spirit 
and talent is a force to be reckoned with. More importantly, this 
deal is not only significant to fellow young actresses or even 
young girls, but it’s an eye-opener for the Black community. This 
young queen represents that regardless of size, we’re capable of 
extraordinary feats. In truth, her accomplishments show that as 
a people, we naturally connect and we’re only scratching the very 
surface of what lies beyond the sky, we have several infinities 
to conquer before we even utter the word “done.” Marsai even 
told Teen Vogue about her high hopes of what we can accomplish 
by saying, “I hope that in 21 years, we won’t even have to be a first 
anymore: First black woman to do this, or first black male, or first 
woman to do that… I hope that we always have diversity, that we 
have equality and representation every step of the way.”

I think that student orgs offer an important 
opportunity for students from different 
backgrounds and perspectives to come together 
to do work they are passionate about. As part of 
my work for a student org, I have been helping to 
organize social justice workshops for high school 
students. These workshops are aimed not only 
at helping the students learn about their own 
identities, but teaching them how to accept people 
with different identities. One of the workshops 
focused on stereotypes and microaggressions. 
This workshop was meant to portray the dangers 
of making assumptions about people based 
on stereotypes and the negative effect that 
microaggressions can have on individuals that are 
subjected to them. When asking the students

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

The change is part of a 

larger effort by the Trump 
administration to push more 
conservative 
regulations 

surrounding abortion, and 
many pro-choice advocates 
have denounced it as a gag 
rule that prevents doctors 
from 
being 
candid 
with 

patients about their options. 
Overall, the Michigan Daily 
Editorial Board finds the rule 
inhibits doctors from doing 
their jobs, prevents patients 
from receiving the full-range 
of family planning services 
available 
and 
indicates 

the 
Trump 
administration 

prioritizes 
the 
evangelical 

agenda over the health and 
economic outcomes of its 
citizens.

The 
Title 
X 
revision, 

first and foremost, poses an 
ethical problem for medical 
professionals. Dr. Leana Wen, 
the 
president 
of 
Planned 

Parenthood, 
expressed 
in 

an interview with NPR that 
“it’s 
unconscionable 
and 

unethical for politicians to 
restrict doctors like me from 
speaking 
honestly 
to 
our 

patients.” The doctor-patient 
relationship 
is 
supposed 

to be built on trust and 
communication, but how can 
this be achieved if doctors 
feel compelled to withhold 
their honest advice? Women 
seeking advice about their 
options in the event of an 
unwanted pregnancy deserve 
to know about all available 
courses of action.

Though 
the 
gag 
rule 

specifically targets abortion 
referrals, it impacts more 
than just abortion services. 
The policy defunds every kind 
of health care these centers 
provide, 
including 
STI 

testing, 
cancer 
screenings 

and forms of contraception. 
For the women who rely on 
these 
other 
services, 
the 

loss of federal funds can be 

devastating. This new rule 
penalizes all who use this 
care, regardless of if they 
actually went for an abortion.

As 
this 
policy 
strips 

federal funding from medical 
facilities 
like 
Planned 

Parenthood, it would help 
finance faith-based women’s 
health 
centers. 
Associated 

with the church and often 
referred to as crisis pregnancy 
centers, these clinics provide 
inadequate health care by 
misleading 
women 
into 

making poor health decisions. 
While Planned Parenthood 
typically informs its patients 
of every option available, 
including abortions, CPCs do 
not mention the possibility 
of a pregnancy termination. 
When it comes to future 
family 
planning, 
normal 

clinics will provide various 
forms of contraception, while 
CPCs 
preach 
abstinence. 

Furthermore, 
these 
CPCs 

are often modeled to look 
like actual health centers, 
which 
confuses 
women 

into thinking they are in a 
medical clinic, rather than a 
religious facility. The policy’s 
endorsement of these faith-
based health centers is a step 
back in women’s reproductive 
health and medical care.

The 
Trump 

administration’s 
support 

of 
these 
abstinence-only 

centers over organizations 
like Planned Parenthood also 
ignores extensive empirical 
research on the improved 
socioeconomic 
outcomes 

associated 
with 
increased 

access to family planning. 
In 
2013, 
the 
Guttmacher 

Institute conducted a review 
of 
66 
studies 
exploring 

the 
social 
and 
economic 

benefits of women’s access 
to contraception. The review 
found in states where women 
were 
given 
early, 
legal 

access to contraception, they 

were more likely to achieve 
post-secondary 
education 

and 
higher 
employment 

rates. Women also earned 
higher salaries, had greater 
purchasing 
power 
and 

narrowed the gender pay gap 
when they had more control 
over 
their 
reproductive 

health. 
In 
the 
realm 
of 

mental health, a growing 
number of studies point to 
a link between unplanned 
childbirth and depression.

As problematic as this 

new policy may be, there 
are ways for both health 
clinics and patients to work 
around it. First, institutions 
like 
Planned 
Parenthood 

can set up specific locations 
where they would perform 
abortions. 
However, 
those 

individual facilities would 
not be eligible for federal 
funds, nor would regular 
health clinics be able to refer 
patients to those other sites. 
On the other hand, patients 
can still ask about abortions 
and doctors would be able 
to answer their questions. 
This means women who are 
educated about their options 
will still have their questions 
answered, but women who 
are not as aware of their 
options can no longer rely 
on doctors to be transparent 
with them.

The overarching impact 

of this gag rule is detrimental 
toward any woman or man 
who relies on these centers’ 
services, not just those who 
need abortions. We hope for 
the sake of these citizens this 
initiative will be blocked in 
court. In the event it is not, 
one such way to mitigate 
these 
detrimental 
effects 

will be to promote education 
of women’s health and the 
clinics 
that 
actually 
and 

effectively promote women’s 
health.

Threats to the rule of law

R

ussian author Leo Tolstoy 
once said, “Wrong does not 
cease to be wrong because 

the majority share in it.” This wisdom 
has obviously been lost on a growing 
number of counties across the 
U.S., where localities are declaring 
themselves Second Amendment 
sanctuaries and thereby exempting 
themselves from obeying certain 
state-level gun control laws. The 
trend started nearly a month ago in 
Quay County, New Mexico, where 
Sheriff Russell Shafer submitted 
a resolution to affirm his right “to 
not enforce any unconstitutional 
firearms law against any citizen.” 
The Quay County Commission 
voted unanimously in favor of the 
resolution . 

In a week, six more New 

Mexican counties had adopted 
similar measures, and by last week 
most of New Mexico’s counties 
were on board. The growing body 
of Second Amendment sanctuary 
counties joins the coalition of 
sheriffs in Washington state who, 
in early February, made a similar 
commitment to not enforce new 
state-level gun controls. Moreover, 
the trend has emboldened sheriffs in 
Colorado, Nevada and Oregon to defy 
recently passed gun control laws in 
their respective states as well.

This trend marks a disturbing 

departure from the Washington 
sheriffs’ 
disobedience, 
which 
I 

previously reflected on, in that it 
demonstrates a widespread appeal 
for illegitimately seditious conduct 
before now implausible. In upending 
the respect for the law crucial to 
robust governance — what James 
Madison referred to as the ability 
of “the government to control the 
governed” — Second Amendment 
sanctuary counties invoke a false 
analogy for legal justification. In 
doing so, they also exemplify the 
tendency 
of 
extremist 
Second 

Amendment ideology to ignore 
norms critical to the rule of law.

The resolutions’ nomenclature 

is a tongue-in-cheek jab at the 
sanctuary city (and state) measures 
adopted by numerous localities 
and states in recent years, aimed at 
protecting illegal immigrants from 
the specter of federal immigration 
authorities. To the sheriffs and 
counties defying state gun control 
measures, their “opting out” of 
statewide gun policy is legally and 
morally akin to the cities and states 
that “opted out” of the Trump 
administration’s 
nationwide 

enforcement of federal immigration 

law. Policy aside, the subtext of 
partisan divide is readily apparent.

This argument, however, is 

flawed at its core. There is little 
equivalency between disobeying 
state gun control laws and allowing 
for sanctuary cities. For one, there 
is no “opting out” of statewide 
policy for local law enforcement. 
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee stated 
in regard to his state’s disobedient 
sheriffs, “No one has the ability 
to pick and choose which laws to 
follow.” Sanctuary city laws, on 
the other hand, command state or 
local law enforcement officers to 
not comply with requests by federal 
immigration officers to go above 
and beyond normal police duties 
in pursuing detained immigrants. 
In the former case, subordinates 
are ignoring direct commands 
from superiors to enforce laws on 
the books. In the latter, authorities 
are made not to assist agents who 
enforce a completely separate set of 
laws.

To reiterate: State legislatures 

and the laws they pass displace local 
authorities and their prerogatives. 
By way of example, last month, the 
largely pro-gun Montana House 
passed bills prohibiting certain gun 
controls from being enacted by local 
governments. Should these bills 
become law, would pro-gun control 
sheriffs in Montana be justified 
in labeling their counties as gun 
control sanctuaries, where new gun 
control laws would be allowed in 
violation of higher, state law? The 
answer, for anyone who recognizes 
the prerogative of any state over its 
constituent counties, would be no.

Furthermore, 
the 
growing 

acceptance of Second Amendment 
sanctuary counties demonstrates 
a worrying dismissal of the rule of 
law in America. America’s system 
of governance is revered because 
judgments are dictated by laws, as 
opposed to the whimsical biases or 
selfish preferences of those at the 
top. And the only thing that makes 
these laws durable is the respect 
the people have for them. Women’s 
suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton 
recognized that a republic should 
find it “very important the people 
… respect the laws.” Likewise, laws 
must be universally applicable to 
engender respect. Former U.S. 
Supreme 
Court 
Justice 
Felix 

Frankfurter remarked, “If one man 
can be allowed to determine for 
himself what is law, every man can.” 
Viewing state laws as somehow 
subservient to authoritative decree 

or county-level vote rejects both 
these fundamental tenets.

This 
is 
not 
to 
say 
that 

civil disobedience is under no 
circumstances 
justified. 
Martin 

Luther King, Jr. himself spoke of 
disobeying unconscionable laws 
as “expressing the highest respect 
for law.” But the justifications for 
defiance put forth by sheriffs in 
Second 
Amendment 
sanctuary 

counties offer nothing compatible 
with this exception. In Quay 
County, 
where 
the 
movement 

started, the sheriff intended to 
resist 
“unconstitutional” 
gun 

control laws. Yet, he provided no 
explanation for how New Mexico’s 
new mandatory background check 
laws, legal in many other states, were 
unconstitutional.

In 
Washington 
as 
well, 

no measures included in the 
opposed gun control law violated 
the 
standing 
Supreme 
Court 

interpretations 
of 
the 
Second 

Amendment, rendering invalid the 
argument for disobedience of the 
law. Klickitat County Sheriff Bob 
Songer’s demand that the Supreme 
Court first declare the statewide 
gun control measure constitutional 
before he enforces it was equally 
ludicrous, contradicting concepts 
as fundamental and entrenched 
in 
American 
governance 
as 

preemption and judicial review. The 
sheriffs’ respect for the rule of law 
clearly does not match their bravado.

What can we as Americans 

take away from the rise of 
so-called 
Second 
Amendment 

sanctuary 
counties? 
At 
first 

glance, 
the 
sanctuary 
county 

trend demonstrates a misplaced 
faith in the power of superficial 
analogy. By implying via namesake a 
justification for disobedience, sheriffs 
in four states communicate their 
inability to understand the nuanced 
difference between failing to follow 
a direct order and choosing to assist 
authorities of separate jurisdiction.

But there are more troubling 

problems 
illustrated 
by 
the 

trend than mere ignorance. The 
sheriffs and counties in question 
have trampled on laws, passed by 
legitimately elected officials, by 
non-judicial means and without 
moral justification. Their dereliction 
of duty demonstrates a greater 
disregard for the rule of law than was 
previously imagined in America.

Title X revision will limit adequate health care
I

n 
late 
February, 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s 

administration announced its final rule on a revision 
of the Title X family planning program that could 

potentially divert millions of dollars from Planned 
Parenthood to faith-based health care organizations. 
Under the revision, health care providers hoping to 
receive Title X funding will no longer be able to “refer 
for abortion as a method of family planning, or to 
perform, promote, or support abortion as a method of 
family planning.”

The real emergency for conservatives

I

n season two of Netflix’s 
original series “House of 
Cards,” the show’s main 

character, fictitious U.S. President 
Frank 
Underwood, 
tells 
the 

audience, “The road to power 
is paved with hypocrisy, and 
casualties. Never regret.” In the 
past few weeks, President Donald 
Trump has shown he is taking a 
similar approach in his quest to 
fund his most sought-after agenda 
item: a wall on the southern border.

On Feb. 15, Trump declared 

a national state of emergency 
for the current situation on the 
United States border with Mexico. 
Amid his fears of increasing 
illegal immigration, the president 
has continuously proposed the 
construction of a wall on the border 
in an attempt to dissuade unlawful 
crossing of the U.S. border. After 
weeks 
of 
partisan 
deadlock 

in Congress and the ensuing 
government 
shutdown, 
Trump 

announced he intends to use this 
national 
emergency 
to 
direct 

federal funds toward building the 
border wall he has championed 
throughout his presidency.

The move drew expected 

criticism from those who have 
been opposed to the construction 
of the wall, with many of those 
critics 
being 
outside 
of 
the 

president’s core base. Critics like 
newly-elected 
House 
Speaker 

Nancy Pelosi, most of whom 
come from liberal opposition and 
conservative skeptics, have long 
cited both their moral concerns and 
questions about the effectiveness 
of the wall as justification for their 

stance. However, aside from any 

humanitarian concerns, questions 
about both the character of the U.S. 
as a country and doubts about how 
effective a wall would be in stopping 
illegal 
immigration, 
Trump’s 

decision to use an executive order 
to declare a national emergency 
is cause for a different type of 
opposition.

Some 
conservatives 
see 

Trump’s use of an executive 
order to achieve his political goals 
as a harmful precedent. Some 
are especially concerned for a 
future when a liberal executive 
occupies the Oval Office and 
wishes to implement his or her 
policies without going through the 
constitutional procedure. In a Feb. 4 
conversation with CNN, Sen. John 
Cornyn, R-Texas, noted, “The whole 
idea that presidents — whether it’s 
President Trump, President Warren 
or President Sanders — can declare 
an emergency and somehow usurp 
the separation of powers and get 
into the business of appropriating 
money for specific projects without 
Congress being involved, is a serious 
constitutional question.” For a 
president to simply push a desired 
political accomplishment into action 
via executive order to influence 
the outcome in the constitutional 
process, is a vast and sweeping 
use of executive power. And to 
disregard the power of Congress, 
one of whose main functions is to 
decide the budget of the country, 
is equally as alarming. Political 
motions such as the appropriation 
of government funds are intended 
to pass through both houses. 
The potential use of this case in 
justifying authoritarian measures 
is certainly concerning to many 
conservatives. Even Democratic 
leaders have openly addressed such 
a possibility in their criticism of the 
president’s decision.

Furthermore, the use of this 

precedent by a leader of any party 
is at the very least a constitutional 
question — if not a nightmare — 
for conservatives like me who are 
wary of the powers of government. 
Trump’s national emergency serves 
as an example of a gross misuse of 
federal power and an especially 
grand overreach by the executive 
branch. This implementation of 
an executive order, especially for 
the rapid redirection of funds that 
can occur under a national state of 
emergency, is troubling. It bears 

resemblance to the monarchical 
orders and decrees our founding 
fathers sought to abolish in order 
to create a free country with free 
citizens.

A national state of emergency, 

and the executive power that 
comes with it, should be used in 
the event there is truly a pressing 
problem Congress does not or 
will not have the time to address. 
Former President George W. Bush’s 
declaration of a state of emergency 
following the terrorist attacks on 
Sept. 11, 2001, is a proper example 
that meets such qualifications. In 
this case, though Trump may not 
be happy with the settlement that 
was reached, Congress has taken 
steps to at least temporarily address 
the issue at the border. As Jonah 
Goldberg, author of “Suicide of the 
West” and a writer for National 
Review, wrote, “the lack of a 
political triumph for a president 
isn’t a national emergency,” and it is 
inappropriate for Trump to use this 
last-resort measure to force “his 
desired policy through the political 
system.”

What 
is 
also 
concerning 

is 
the 
president’s 
willingness 

to employ this order to direct 
military personnel and funding 
towards the construction of the 
controversial barrier. Trump has 
publicly discussed the idea of not 
only utilizing military supplies 
and funding, but deploying active 
military as construction workers 
to build the border wall. These 
measures 
would 
take 
funds 

intended for military relief in places 
with natural disasters and other 
true emergencies such as California 
and wwPuerto Rico, as well as 
projects designed to improve the 
infrastructure of our national 
defense, like Navy SEAL training.

MUSIC REVIEW

RUBYWORKS

Remember 
Hozier? 
It’s 
hard not to. For the past five 
years, his has been one of the 
names most often brought up 
in conversations along the 
lines of, When on Earth is that 
artist’s next album going to be 
here?
Five years isn’t the most 
extreme gap in the grand 
scheme of things, but the 
eponymous debut album of 
the Irish singer-songwriter, 
formally known as Andrew 
Hozier-Byrne, 
shook 
the 
world in a way that few debut 
albums are privileged 
to do. Hozier’s unique, 
seamless, heart-driven 
blend of folk, soul, rock 
and blues has left an 
indelible mark on the 
musical world, sparking 
many imitators but few 
who have risen to meet 
his level of talent and 
vision. 
A 
follow-up, 
naturally, was and has 
always been a tall order.
Luckily, 
Wasteland, 
Baby! delivers on every 
front and then some. 
It’s 
a 
comprehensive 
dive (album-cover-pun 
intended) into some of the 
depths of Hozier’s personality 
and values left unexplored on 
Hozier. Hozier gave us tender 
affection, sardonic accusation, 
campy friendship and druggy 
poetry. The new sophomore 
record 
builds 
on 
these 
strengths with its offerings 
of well-considered lyricism, 
thoughtful tribute, immersive 
rock 
and 
thoughtful, 
referential 
appreciation 
of 
music itself.
One of the traits that makes 
Wasteland, Baby! shine is the 
fact that Hozier knows how 
to 
compartmentalize. 
He’s 
aware that he’s borrowing 
from the libraries of many 
different genres, and although 
he doesn’t let this awareness 
guide him too strongly or 
box him in, he does use it to 
concentrate his genre fluencies 

in the areas where they’ll 
serve him the most effectively. 
His penchant for roiling rock 
surfaces on “No Plan” and 
“Dinner & Diatribes,” while 
other tracks like “Shrike,” 
“Almost (Sweet Music)” and 
“Wasteland, 
Baby!” 
recall 
his 
folksy 
sensibilities. 
A 
thread of natural expertise 
runs 
beneath 
everything, 
reaffirming Hozier’s position 
as a virtual chameleon among 
the adjacent and overlapping 
worlds of the genres he’s 
choosing to explore.
In many ways, the album as 
a whole adds up to a love letter 
to music. It opens, of course, 
with “Nina Cried Power,” the 

title track and lead single off 
of last September’s EP, the 
official mark of Hozier’s first 
release since 2014. An earth-
shaking 
collaboration 
with 
Mavis Staples, “Nina Cried 
Power” is a tribute to the 
anthemic and, yes, powerful 
protest work of musicians like 
Nina Simone, Billie Holiday, 
B.B. King, Bob Dylan and 
more. A thank you note turned 
up several notches, the opener 
shouts 
out 
Staples 
while 
benefiting from her inimitable 
vocals, and it places Hozier 
in a distinct and personable 
position: His music has never 
been anywhere near meek, 
but it can still be modest and 
grounded in a way that helps 
it locate its place amid a much 
vaster expanse of influence, 
history and musical mastery.
“Almost (Sweet Music)” is 

an apt follow-up, thanking 
musical masters like Duke 
Ellington and Chet Baker while 
providing a suitable segue into 
Hozier’s 
later 
explorations 
of his personal relationships 
and the ways in which they 
intersect 
with 
music 
in 
general. This is perhaps one 
of the most consistent veins 
characterizing 
the 
rest 
of 
the album. In addition to 
explicitly 
illustrating 
his 
artistic 
appreciations 
in 
songs like the celebratory, 
yet moderately low-key, “To 
Noise 
Making 
(Sing),” 
he 
demonstrates their existence 
in tandem with his own more 
personal 
preoccupations. 
His fusion of various 
alternative genres with 
odes to the past and 
present, and lyrics so 
good you could read 
them without the music 
and still fall in love, 
is by turns seductive, 
introspective, 
modern 
and 
wholly 
mythological.
The more personal 
elements 
of 
Hozier’s 
characteristics 
as 
an 
artist that made his 
debut so successful — 
his unapologetic anger, 
his ready weirdness and 
affinity for careful, unique 
lyrics that veer between the 
sensitive and the violent — 
are all still there on this new 
album, just engineered along 
different paths, which is the 
main crux of what makes 
Wasteland, Baby! so fitting and 
interesting. These 14 tracks 
are the proof we may have 
been waiting for, whether 
consciously or unconsciously, 
that 
Hozier 
hasn’t 
gone 
anywhere. He’s been here all 
along, thinking and listening 
and working and writing, and 
waiting, like the shrike, for the 
perfect time to pounce. True 
to the album cover indeed, 
Hozier is ready to submerge us, 
to tug us along the depths of a 
place fully understood by no 
one and illuminate something 
for us amid a shipwreck. We 
should be so lucky.

Hozier’s sophomore album 
proves he’s here to stay

Snow 
still 
blows 
over 
Michigan 
in 
March, 
but 
Detroiters can now enjoy a 
day at “The Beach,” an art 
installation designed as a ball 
pit beach.
“The Beach” is indoors but 
thematically emulates a real 
beach, with sloping shorelines, 
umbrella-shaded 
lounge 
chairs, a lifeguard and blow-
up beach balls. But instead of 
water, “The Beach” is filled 
with 400,000 plastic balls.
Located in the heart of 
downtown, one can go for a 
swim at “The Beach” right 
after ice skating across the 
street at Campus Martius. It’s 
free and open to the public, 
accepting both walk-ins and 
online reservations.
The exhibit quietly debuted 

on Friday, Mar. 1 with pictures 
of Detroiters enjoying “The 
Beach” hitting Instagram. By 
Saturday, reservations for a 
swim were booked for the next 
two weeks. When I went Sunday 
afternoon, the line for walk-ins 
wrapped all around the lobby. 
Surprisingly, 
it 
wasn’t 
just 

kids and their parents. Trendy 
young adults were swimming 

too, Snapchatting their entire 
experience.
The 
artists 
behind 
“The 
Beach,” Alex Mustonen, Daniel 
Arsham and Ben Porto, are 
partners at the New York 
design studio Snarkitecture. 
The firm is best known for 
designing unique brick and 
mortar stores for KITH, 
a high-end footwear and 
clothing retailer. Many of 
their art installations and 
architecture 
projects 
are 
collaborative, 
immersive 
designs, 
often 
built 
within existing spaces or 
architecture.
“The Beach” debuted in 
Washington D.C. in 2015 and 
has since been installed in 
cities all across the world, 
including 
Paris, 
Sydney 
and 
Bangkok. 
Detroit’s 
installment was produced 
in collaboration with Library 
Street Collective, a Detroit art 

gallery. The local contemporary 
art gallery is behind many 
art installations in Detroit, 
including the Rainbow City 
Roller Rink that previously 
occupied “The Beach”’s space 
at 1001 Woodward.
A ball pit may conjure up 
memories of a colorful Chuck 
E. 
Cheese 
nightmare, 
but 
“The Beach” is sleek, cool and 
inviting. A wide open space 
with mirrors along all the walls 
make it feel even bigger. It’s 
lively, but by no means crowded. 
The plastic balls are recyclable 
and antimicrobial, so it’s both 
environmentally friendly and 

sanitary (as sanitary as a ball 
pit can be, anyway). Like many 
of 
Snarkitecture’s 
projects, 
“The 
Beach” 
is 
all-white, 
including the “shore” and the 
sea of balls. The only pops of 
color come from blow-up toys 
such as a pink flamingo or a 
striped inner-tube.
Two piers reach out into the 
pit where swimmers can jump 
into the pit, and there’s an island 
in the middle that visitors can 
swim to. Moving around in the 
pit is surprisingly difficult. It’s 
very relaxing to lay immersed 
in the balls — perhaps even 
more so than being in the water 

at a real beach. My 45-minute 
swim session was mostly spent 
lounging in the ball pit. Partly 
because it was so comfortable, 
partly because I ran out of 
breath every time I tried to 
get off my back. Both visually 
cool and physically soothing, 
“The Beach” is a unique, fun 
exhibition.
For modern art appreciators 
that enjoy an immersive and 
interactive experience, “The 
Beach” Detroit will remain 
open Wednesday to Sunday 
each week through Apr. 14th — 
so get your swim in while you 
can.

There’s 
an 
art 
to 
trash 
television. The idiosyncrasies, 
the poorly veiled intervention 
by producers and the staged 
emotional 
outbursts 
are 
a 
delicate formula. Its raw and 
repugnant power comes with 
great responsibility that only few 
can weild. “Mexican Dynasties” 
appears to have all the makings 
of the new best-worst 
show on television — 
come on, it’s produced 
by 
Bravo. 
Somehow, 
though, 
this 
show 
no one wanted falls 
triumphantly 
flat 
of 
being 
anything 
noteworthy.
“Mexican Dynasties” 
follows three families 
of 
self-proclaimed 
Mexican royalty living 
it up to the fullest 
in Mexico City. The 
three families are the 
Allendes, the Bessudos 
and 
the 
Madrazos. 
They each made their 
fortunes in different ways: luxury 
cars, soft drinks and just being 
handsome, respectively. While 
they’re each different, I really 
couldn’t tell you which is which. 
The plot is simple: Rich people 
are weird. The Allendes have 
zero boundaries. Their son Adán 
is 27, still lives with them and 
spends each morning in their bed 
for “cuddles.” He had a beloved 
parrot who died, so they stuck 
it in the freezer for two weeks 

until the rest of the family got 
back from vacation in Istanbul. 
Again, rich people being weird. 
Occasionally, a well-placed crack 
about Trump’s tweets or the 
wall sneaks its way into their 
conversation, which is fun.
One of the best parts of the 
show is the help. Maids, cooks 
and the like are featured in the 
“interview” segments of the 
show to dish on the strangeness 
of the families. When I say “best,” 
it’s really telling because the 

servants don’t really dish all that 
much. Their comments amount 
mostly to saying the families are 
weird. Which we knew and could 
see.
There are lots of really great 
bad television shows. “Little 
Women: LA” is not only bad, 
but hilarious and borderline 
fetishized. It at least presents a 
moral quandary to ponder and 
forget about when the women 
start fighting. Likewise, “90 

Day Fiancé” is a smorgasbord of 
awkwardness and cringe in the 
most wonderful and alarming 
ways. “Dance Moms” is a travesty 
of pure genius. The cutthroat 
“Lord of the Files” atmosphere 
that surrounds these moms, as 
their kids flail about to terrible 
music is simply a thing of beauty.
But that is not “Mexican 
Dynasties.” This is a show 
whose only aim seems to present 
the 
strangeness 
or 
general 
ordinariness of rich Mexicans. It’s 
not really exciting or 
fun. It’s not so strange 
that it makes its viewers 
uncomfortable, 
with 
the flair and stumbling 
of “Married at First 
Sight.” No, “Mexican 
Dynasties” simply is. It 
just exists. Not a whole 
lot happens in this 
show, which is fine. As 
the families announce 
in the opening of the 
show, 
“Americans 
don’t know shit about 
Mexico.” 
Which 
is 
fair. I certainly don’t. 
I also don’t know who 
this show is meant 
for. Are we supposed to see rich 
Mexicans just existing or being 
odd? Because if that was the 
aim, they’ve done it. I see these 
rich Mexicans. They are pretty 
normal, 
with 
idiosyncrasies 
here and there. It plays out more 
like “The Truman Show” than 
a reality show. It doesn’t make 
good television, but it does make 
a point. Mexicans and rich people 
are pretty normal. Nothing to see 
here.

‘Mexican Dynasties’ is 
poorly crafted trash TV

Welcome 
back

to 

school

While 
I 
have 
written 
previously about music from 
the 
Anglosphere 
for 
this 
column, I try to reserve my 
attention 
towards 
foreign-
language 
music. 
Exceptions 
occur when even something 
from 
the 
Anglosphere 
is 
distinctly 
inseparable 
from 
a time and place outside of 
the United States. Grime, for 
example. Mike Skinner’s (going 
by the name The Streets) 2002 
album Original Pirate Material, 
an album that has gripped me 
and intrigued me from my very 
first listen, is one of those.
An album more readers will 
likely be familiar with that 
closely resembles the anecdotal, 
slice-of-life stories of nights 
out and spurned romance is 
The Arctic Monkeys’s 2006 
debut 
Whatever 
People 
Say 
I Am, That’s What I’m Not. 
Though the album lacks Alex 
Turner’s unmatched wit and 
the 
creativity 
of 
American 
hip-hop’s greatest storytellers, 
Skinner, a Birmingham native, 
managed to make a thoroughly 
engaging, unique album that 
influenced music in the U.K. for 
years to come.
I 
personally 
wouldn’t 
characterize what Skinner does 
on this album as “rapping” per 
se, at least not in the sense that 
we’re used to. Sure, there’s 
rhyming and wordplay, but 
frankly, Skinner’s lines are 
awkwardly wordy at several 
points and purely clumsy at 
others. He sounds more like 
an 
overzealous 
beat 
poet 
than a rapper. And it fits. The 
instrumentals are metallic and 
precise — think the opposite 
of the unquantized drums J 
Dilla made a specialty. There’s 
definitely more two-step and 
garage influence rather than 
jazz and soul, which makes 
complete sense, as those were 
the 
genres 
that 
ruled 
the 
dancefloors of the U.K. at the 
time.
Skinner 
tells 
stories 
of 
the mundane and the mind-

numbingly boring and somehow 
makes them seem grand all 
at once. “Cause this is our 
zone, videos, televisions, 64s, 
playstations, weigh up Henry 
with precision, few herbs and 
a bit of Benson,” he raps on one 
of the album’s standouts, “Has 
It Come To This?” He later 
mentions, 
“My 
underground 
trains run from Mile End 
to Ealing, From Brixton to 
Boundsgreen” 
and 
“Deep 
seated urban decay, deep seated 
urban decay, Rip down posters I 
like from last week’s big garage 
night.” Skinner describes and 

references areas of the young 
and working class, far from the 
glamorous locales Americans 
often associate with the U.K. 
These garage nights serve as 
the respite from the urban 
blight caused by the repressive 
austerity policies of politicians 
past and present.
“Weak Become Heroes” is 
Skinner’s personal reflection 

on raving culture, but serves 
as 
a 
surprisingly 
poignant 
reflection on youth in general, 
easily divorceable from the 
context of the album and just 
as prescient today. Describing a 
drug-fueled night out, he raps, 
“Same piano loops over, arms 
wave, eyes roll back, And jaws 
fall open, see in soft focus…
Yo, they could settle wars with 
this.” He later reflects, “Then 
the girl in the café taps me 
on the shoulder, I realize five 
years went by and I’m older/ 
Memories 
smolder, 
winter’s 
colder/ But that same piano 
loops over and over,” himself 
rapping over a looped piano. 
It’s an ode to those magical 
moments 
of 
eternal 
youth, 
freedom from the drudgeries 
and pain and stresses modern 
capitalism inflicts. It’s an ode to 
feeling, truly feeling. Ironically, 
I myself shudder at the prospect 
of realizing five years went by 
and memories smoldering, but 
Skinner’s assertion that the 
same looped piano remains 
somewhat comforting.
Despite 
being 
heavily 
influenced by the American art 
form of hip-hop, Original Pirate 
Material 
is 
unapologetically 
English. 
Skinner’s 
regional 
accent shines through, and he 
makes a point to mention he’s 
talking about “geezers” and 
“birds.” The influence it has 
to this day is remarkable. A 
short while later, Dizzee Rascal 
released arguably the Illmatic 
of the young genre of grime, 
Boy in da Corner. Nobody could 
deny how much it, and all the 
music that followed, owed to 
Mike Skinner’s masterpiece.
Original Pirate Material is 
an album about being young 
and bored. However, youth is 
not admired; age is not feared. 
Skinner just describes being 
alive, being stupid, being aware 
that the present-day routine 
will one day become nostalgia 
fodder. 
At 
the 
beginning, 
his words, and the album 
in general, actually kind of 
depressed me. But now, having 
listened to it more times than 
I can count, I understand the 
comfort underlining it all.

Another dive into grime: 
‘Original Pirate Material’

DAILY WORLD MUSIC COLUMN

SAYAN GHOSH
Daily World Music Columnist

Original Pirate 
Material is an 
album about 
being young and 
bored. However, 
youth is not 
admired; age is 
not feared. 

If “Capernaum” had a thesis, it 
would be the reason 12-year-old 
protagonist Zain El Hajj (Zain al 
Rafeea, debut) gives for taking his 
parents to civil court: “Because I 
was born.”
Out of context, Zain’s request 
may register as absurd. How could 
giving life to someone ever be seen 
as a crime? Why would a child 
criminalize his own existence? 
And what court of law would hear 
such a claim? But in the context 
of Nadine Labaki’s (“Where Do 
We Go Now?”) unabashed film 
depicting life on the bottom 
socioeconomic tier in Lebanon, 
she unveils the traumatic blows 
Zain has sustained from every 
angle by age 12, so that by the 
end, it is hardly Zain’s testament 
that seems absurd. Instead, it is 
the life his family and his society 
have left him with, as well as the 
so-called justice system intended 
to protect the wounded like him, 
that we are called to interrogate.
Labaki 
skillfully 
navigates 
these 
commentaries 
with 
the 
episodic 
construction 
of 
“Capernaum.” She punctuates 
the chaos of her protagonist’s life 
with scenes from the court case 
in which Zain sues his parents, 
making almost loyal returns 
from Zain’s turbulent existence 
to that space of alleged law and 
order. This juxtaposition creates 
a tension in the middle of which 
Zain 
suffers 
immensely 
but 
shines resiliently.
In the episodes of the chaos, 
we encounter a triad of parental 
figures: 
Zain’s 
impoverished, 
downtrodden 
parents 
who 

neglect their many children; 
Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw), an 
undocumented migrant worker 
from Ethiopia and single mother 
of 
infant 
Yonas 
(Boluwatife 
Treasure Bankole); and, although 
he is only 12 years old, Zain. This 
trio is structured around the 
parental neglect and absence — 
the kind that stems from adverse 
social conditions and selfishness 
— from putting one’s own survival 
in front of that of your children. In 
moments of self-sacrifice, these 
parental figures move to the apex 
of the trio; Labaki represents 
selflessness as the cornerstone of 
love rather than the antithesis of 
survival.
But when we ask that sacrifice 
of a child, when we ask someone 
who needs nurturing of their 

own to be a self-reliant nurturer, 
we see how a boy begins to see 
lifegiving as a crime. Zain is 
unguarded. He has an extensive 
repertoire of obscenities. He 
knows what could happen to a 
young girl like his sister once she 
starts menstruating and is seen 
as a woman. Zain knows what 
could happen to a child like Yonas 
if he is not fiercely cared for. He 
shouldn’t, but he does, and he uses 
that knowledge to care for the 
vulnerable when no one else will.
In the commission of this tall 
order of care and protection, Zain 
breaks the law. We learn that the 

courtroom scene is not Zain’s 
first appearance in court, that 
he is serving a five-year sentence 
for stabbing his sister’s husband, 
roughly triple her age. The same 
way Labaki complexifies Zain’s 
explanation for the suing his 
parents, she does the same with 
Zain’s carceral status. It sounds 
acceptable, if not prudent, that 
Zain do time for his violence. 
Taken with the episodes of 
trauma, however, it is the legal 
system that begins to seem 
absurd. The prospect of removing 
crime from its circumstances and 
deciding what individual gets 
to atone for societal ills and of 
looking at a child offender with 
the same removed contempt 
as one would look at an adult 
offender 
are 
absurdities 
in 
Labaki’s 
book. 
Children 
like 
Zain stand and flinch in their 
crosshairs.
Zain is the heart and the 
heartbreak 
of 
“Capernaum.” 
Through 
the 
mature, 
foulmouthed, 
brave, 
selfless, 
strong character of twelve-year-
old Zain, Labaki unabashedly 
shows us how what we expect 
from 
children 
measures 
up 
to what we give. At the same 
time, we entrust children with 
the 
cross-generational 
hope 
for change, we expect them to 
fend for that without laying the 
groundwork for that change. We 
repeat our parents’ mistakes, 
we resign to flawed institutions, 
and yet somehow still expect 
change. That is why we need to 
see Labaki’s Zain. We learn from 
his stories and his crimes, his 
unlikely triumphs and his naïve 
failures. We need the painful 
reckoning of “Capernaum.”

FILM REVIEW

Everyone has a routine. For 
me, it’s listening to an episode 
of “The Daily” podcast while 
I eat a slice of banana bread 
and drink my Ceylon black tea 
every morning.
For the narrator of Samantha 
Downing’s “My Lovely Wife,” 
it’s stopping at the the EZ-Go 
gas station two miles from 
his home to get a cup of 
coffee. It’s having a movie 
night with his family every 
week. It’s cheering at the 
sidelines for each one of his 
daughter’s soccer game.
The 
narrator 
sounds 
pretty 
much 
like 
your 
everyday man. A loving 
father. A doting husband. 
He’s the kind of guy that 
would have a nice word for 
everyone.
He also kills with his wife.
Their routine is like this: He 
would meet his women at bars, 
acting as a non-threatening 
deaf man. They’d chat. They 
might share some more drinks. 
By the end of the hour, he’s 
invited to spend the night. The 
next day, he lets his wife know 
if the woman is “right.” If she 
is, the events progress rapidly. 
His wife would capture the 
aforementioned woman, then 

murder her. It’s a delicious, 
sexy secret between them. 
Who would suspect a duo? 
But when one of the victims is 
discovered, something doesn’t 
add up. She was supposed to be 
dead for over a year. Instead, 
the autopsy reports that she’s 
been dead for only a few 
weeks. The narrator realizes 
that his wife has been keeping 
secrets from him. Gradually, 
the picturesque suburban life 

that this couple has built up is 
starting to crumble.
Written 
in 
first-person, 
“My Lovely Wife” makes it 
difficult not to get attached to 
the narrator. Despite his role 
as an accomplice, it’s tempting 
to absolve him. Some men buy 
chocolate and roses to please 
their partner. He kills for her. 
You almost want to cheer him 
on and you certainly don’t want 
him to get caught. Think of the 

children! Due to the limitations 
of first person, the tensions 
are higher. The wife who had 
once seemed like an alluring 
woman shifts into the role of 
a 
cold-hearted 
psychopath. 
It’s hard to pinpoint if the 
reason is due to Downing’s 
masterful revelations as the 
novel switches from past to 
present, uncovering more and 
more details that had seemed 
benign at first glance, or if the 
reason is more sinister. Has 
the 
unreliable 
narrator 
clouded our perception? 
Has he weaved a persona 
of a wife that doesn’t exist? 
The readers can only rely 
on the husband to get each 
answer. By the last quarter 
of the book, the mound 
of questions start getting 
answered. Somehow each 
reveal is more shocking 
than 
the 
last. 
With 
mounting, almost morbid 
horror, the novel is impossible 
to put down.
“My 
Lovely 
Wife” 
is 
marketed as your “Mr. and 
Mrs. Smith” meets “Gone Girl,” 
but it’s more than that. It’s a 
twisty, psychological thriller 
that has your blood pumping, 
your sympathy awry and an 
ending so satisfying that I’m 
already looking forward to 
Samantha 
Downing’s 
next 
book.

I

n observance of Women’s 
History Month, The Daily’s 
sports section kicks off its 
second annual series aimed at 
telling the 
stories of 
female ath-
letes, coaches 
and teams at 
the University 
from the per-
spective of the 
female sports 
writers on 
staff. Former 
managing 
sports editor 
Laney Byler starts the series 
with this column.
I called Nicole Auerbach 
on Friday morning, ready to 
talk about the numbers behind 
women in sports journalism. 
I wanted to talk about her 
experiences, her role covering 
national college football for 
The Athletic and how much 
importance she placed in 
women setting up other women 
for success in a field dominated 
by men.
At some point, the conversa-
tion landed on an internship 
she did the summer after her 
freshman year of college. It 
was 2008, and Auerbach got an 
internship with 
The Trentonian 
in New Jersey. 
She’d spend the 
summer cover-
ing the Yankees’ 
AA team, the 
Trenton Thun-
der, and jump 
into her career 
as a sports-
writer.
When she 
was younger, she’d read Sports 
Illustrated cover-to-cover. She 
loved writing, and she loved 
sports, but she didn’t know 
where to start — until she 
found The Daily. She ended up 
covering sports ranging from 
club ultimate frisbee to wom-

en’s gymnastics. For someone 
who thought that reporting 
sports would be an ideal job, 
that internship with The Tren-
tonian had potential to really 
assist her in becoming a sports 
journalist. 
Then she found out she 
was barred from entering the 
Thunder’s locker room. In 
2008. 
Games ended around 10 p.m., 
and she’d have to wait outside 
the locker room for players that 
she asked for (or sometimes, 
she wouldn’t get the oppor-
tunity to speak with players 
at all). She realized she was 
missing out on the raw answers 
players gave immediately after 
their games. Then she had to 
race against deadline after 
her interviews, hoping to get 
her story in on time despite 
not having the same access as 
other people. 
As far as obstacles go, not 
being allowed to enter the 
locker room was a pretty big 
one. 
“I brought it up to my edi-
tor — one thing I’ve always 
been very fortunate to have 
is editors that have really had 
my back on this stuff — so my 
editor made it happen,” she 
told me on Fri-
day. “He called 
them, and they 
tried to tell him 
that the rule 
was because I 
was an intern 
and not a full-
time employee 
at a newspaper 
— not because 
I was a woman. 
And he said 
‘That’s ridiculous. She’s on 
deadline, she has a job to do, 
and you need to let her in.’”
And then?
“And then they did.”
For women in sports jour-
nalism, barriers to entry can 
range from being barred from 

a locker room to facing a lack 
of female role models in higher 
positions. In a sphere his-
torically dominated by men, 
Auerbach’s story 
shows just how 
far some women 
have to reach to 
level the playing 
field. 
Of course, 
that playing 
field was lev-
eled with a push 
from her and her 
editor. The next 
summer, when 
a baseball coach asked her, 
“Did you understand every-
thing I said?” she received the 
same amount of support from 
her editors, who gave her the 
choice to cover that team or 
move on to a different one.
Having allies in the room — 

male allies, specifically — was 
one way to crunch that barrier.
“I think that every woman 
in this field has stories like 
that, where you 
have to figure 
out how you’re 
going to navi-
gate something 
and whether 
or not you’re 
going to tell 
your bosses,” 
Auerbach said. 
“Because you 
don’t want them 
to think that 
you’re not capable of handling 
yourself in the field and in 
these situations, but you also 
want them to know so they 
have your back, in exactly the 
way my editors did in both of 
those situations. Because they 
100 percent went to bat for 

me.”
Now Auerbach covers 
national college football for 
The Athletic, along with Chan-
tel Jennings — 
both of whom are 
alumni of The 
Daily’s sports 
staff. For them, 
support networks 
of women in the 
industry have 
been vital to han-
dling their role 
as sports journal-
ists. 
But these 
examples preach the impor-
tance of having allies for 
women in a world dominated 
by barriers. While having net-
works for female support are 
necessary, having support from 
both men and women would 
close the gap even further. 

 “Everyone deserves a spot 
at the table,” Jennings said 
on Saturday, “and if it’s only 
women who are bringing 
women to the 
table, or if it’s 
only people of 
color who are 
bring people 
of color to the 
table, we’re not 
going to have 
an accurate 
representa-
tion. Or, it’s 
just going to be 
really, really 
slow. 
“It needs to be everyone. 
Everyone has to look out for 
everyone.”

Minnesota Massacre

Michigan’s season ends at hands of Golden Gophers with Big Ten Tournament sweep punctuated by 4-1 Saturday blowout

MINNEAPOLIS — It was 
over before it even started. Rem 
Pitlick made sure of it.
With a goal to his name 
already and up 3-0 with three 
minutes left in the second 
period, Minnesota’s star center 
gathered a pass from Tyler 
Sheehy in the right circle and 
without hesitation knifed the 
puck into the top of Michigan’s 
net, ending whatever small 
pulse the Wolverines’ season 
clung to.
“They came out to play and 
we didn’t,” said junior forward 
Jake Slaker. “It showed on the 
scoreboard.”
At times this season, the 
Michigan hockey team looked 
like the lethal, fast-skating team 
that most pegged it to be coming 
into the season.
Others moments weren’t as 
rosy. The Wolverines would 
often come out and win a 
Friday game, and outshoot their 
opponent on a Saturday, only to 
be outdone by costly turnovers 
in games they largely had a 
chance to win.
Saturday’s 
4-1 
loss 
to 
Minnesota was neither. Call it 
a season-ending loss or call it 
a decisive nail 
in the coffin to 
a season once 
rife with hope. 
But either way, 
by the time the 
buzzer sounded, 
Michigan 
was 
nothing 
but 
a 
shadow 
of 
its 
once-lofty 
potential.
“They jumped 
us,” said Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson. “We weren’t ready to 
play. That’s been an issue from 
time to time this year. Other 
games we’ve been able to claw 
ourselves out of it. The last time 
we were in here, we were down 
three-zip and we had to claw 
our way out of it. At this time of 
year, when teams are desperate, 
you can’t do that.”

Pearson always mentioned 
the Wolverines’ fourth line as a 
group that he was comfortable 
matching up with any line in the 
country. But just five minutes 
into the game, the Golden 
Gophers’ Tommy Novak burned 
freshman forward Nolan Moyle 
past the boards, letting the 
127-game veteran waltz into 
Michigan’s crease unguarded 
and flip in Minnesota’s first goal 
behind 
freshman 
goaltender 
Strauss Mann.
Junior 
forward 
Will 
Lockwood 
responded 
by 
shaking 
Minnesota 
goaltender Mat 
Robson 
out 
of his net but 
missed a golden 
opportunity 
to 
tie the game by 
sending the puck wide of the left 
post.
And after cutting down on 
defensive zone turnovers, senior 
defenseman 
Joseph 
Cecconi 
mishandled a centering pass 
into the hands of Scott Reedy. 
Seven minutes after Minnesota 
notched its first goal, Reedy 
danced around every Wolverine 
on the ice and doubled the 

Golden Gophers’ lead.
Michigan’s 
power 
play 
remained inconsistent, if not 
dormant, as it had been for the 
series and most of the season — 
the Wolverines didn’t convert 
either of their two tries in the 
first two periods and leave 
Minneapolis 0-6 with a man 
advantage. 
With an early exit after last 
year’s run, Michigan has more 
questions than answers on its 
plate.
Will Quinn Hughes leave? 
If he does, how will the 
Wolverines replace him and 
senior 
defenseman 
Joseph 
Cecconi’s 53 points?
What 
about 
Josh 
Norris 
and his injury? Can this year’s 
underclassmen step up and 
provide more consistent offense? 
Will next year’s recruiting class 
get to campus and contribute?
“(We need) good recruiting,” 
Pearson said. “We gotta hit the 
recruiting hard. We’ve got some 
good pieces, but we’re a ways 
away from being the team we 
need to be.”
“I think there’s a lot of 
things that can change,” Slaker 
added. “It’s just one of those 
things where we get back to 
work and work on ... just about 
everything.”

MINNEAPOLIS 
— 
Seven 
minutes 
into 
practice 
on 
Thursday afternoon, Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson gathered his 
team at center ice.
The Wolverines, a day away 
from the first game of a best-
of-three Big Ten Tournament 
series at Minnesota, lacked the 
focus and attention to detail 
Pearson wanted to see. After 
a quick reminder, the effort 
level improved, and Michigan 
carried momentum into Friday 
night’s game.
“They’ll 
show 
up 
and 
compete tomorrow,” Pearson 
said on Thursday. “But it’s — 
as a coach, you’ve watched the 
tapes. You’ve seen the team, as 
our staff has. We understand 
how good Minnesota is. Players 
just want to play. They don’t 
watch all that. They don’t 
understand, how — maybe at 
times how good (a team is). You 
can tell them that, but — we just 
wanted to get their attention 
today.”
Though 
the 
Wolverines 
eventually lost in overtime, 
Michigan 
entered 
the 
first 
period with energy and focus 
and lit the lamp first on Friday 

night. Pearson got his team’s 
attention.
But 
on 
Saturday, 
in 
a 
season-ending 4-1 loss, the 
Wolverines started the game 
about how they started practice 
on Thursday. And this time, 
Michigan wouldn’t be saved 
by the fact that how it started 
didn’t truly matter.
“I’m a firm believer (in) you 
play as you practice, for the 
most part,” Pearson said. “For 
the most part. You just want to 
make sure that you’re — we don’t 
play tonight. Thank goodness 
we didn’t play tonight, we’d be 
down 5-0, first period. It just — 
we’re sloppy.”
Saturday’s game mattered 
more than any other game had 
all season. The Wolverines were 
60 minutes away from the end 
of their season, but they didn’t 
start the game like a team that 
was so close to elimination.
While it wasn’t quite the 
5-0 deficit Pearson mentioned 
Thursday, Michigan was in a 
deep hole and trailed, 3-0, after 
the first period. The Wolverines 
played better in the ensuing 
40 minutes, particularly in 
the second stanza. But by that 
point, the hole was too deep.
“They came out ready to 
play in the first and we were on 
our heels,” said 
junior 
forward 
Jake Slaker. “It’s 
tough to go down 
three 
in 
the 
first period and 
chase. I think 
we did it last 
time 
we 
were 
here and we had 
a 
little 
better 
comeback 
than 
we did tonight 
but, like I said, they came ready 
and we didn’t. And at that point, 
it was too late.”
Just as Pearson had warned 
his team before the series 
started, a slow start led to a 
deep deficit.
Michigan started better in 
the second period, outshooting 
the Golden Gophers 10-6 in 
the frame. The majority of 

Minnesota’s shots came on the 
power play late in the period 
after the Wolverines had spent 
the majority of the stanza 
putting pressure on goaltender 
Mat Robson.
“We 
were 
embarrassed,” 
Pearson said. “We played with 
a little bit more pride in the 
second 
period. 
We 
worked 
hard.”
Despite Michigan’s efforts in 
its best period of the game, none 
of the shots were close enough. 
None of the Wolverines’ scoring 
chances were truly ‘Grade-A’ 
chances. 
And 
when 
you’re 
down 3-0 in a game that could 
end your season, close isn’t 
good enough.
“We’ve had trouble scoring 
goals,” 
Pearson 
said 
on 
Saturday. “We really have all 
year, and that’s why we’ve 
been in so many tight overtime 
games and come out on the 
wrong end of those. But that 
wasn’t the case tonight. They 
were the better team.”
A late goal by junior forward 
Adam Winborg did little more 
than 
prevent 
Robson 
from 
getting a shutout. It was too 
late, way too late. Michigan 
knew it.
The 
Wolverines 
couldn’t 
clear the mental hurdle that 
comes 
along 
with 
getting 
in such a deep 
hole 
in 
an 
elimination 
game. 
Not 
starting on time 
put Michigan in 
a spot it couldn’t 
come back from, 
and it ended the 
Wolverines’ 
season.
“Mentally, it’s hard,” Pearson 
said. “It’s hard when you’re one 
game down and all of a sudden 
you’re down 1-0, 2-0. The mind 
is a powerful thing and I just 
don’t know if we were in the 
right frame of mind or believed 
we could come in and win this 
game tonight.
“If you’re in that spot, it’s a 
bad spot to be in.”

Junior forward Jake Slaker said that the Michigan hockey team didn’t come to play in Saturday’s season-ending loss.

They came 
to play and 
we didn’t. It

We’ve had 
trouble scoring 
goals. We really 
have all year.

Wolverines 
collapse in 
second half, 
lose 75-63

EAST LANSING — With 13 seconds 
left in the game, Cassius Winston 
traveled.
Normally, it would be a quick play 
stoppage — a few substitutions and then 
an inbound. But this was no normal 
timeout. Rather, it was more of an 
extended flex.
The PA announced the seniors, wing 
Matt McQuaid and forward Kenny 
Goins. Both got down on the floor and 
kissed the Spartans’ logo as they pumped 
up the crowd.
No. 7 Michigan (26-5 overall, 15-5 Big 
Ten) could only sit and watch as No. 9 
Michigan State (25-6, 16-4) milked every 
last moment of its 75-63 win on the way 
to a Big Ten title.
For 30 minutes, it seemed like the 
Wolverines could do what seemed 
unthinkable two weeks ago.
After 
losing 
to 
Michigan 
State 
at Crisler Center two weeks agoo, 
Michigan’s Big Ten hopes were on life 
support. But when the Spartans lost to 
Indiana the next weekend and Purdue 
lost to Minnesota, the door was once 
again wide open. Win at the Breslin 
Center, win the Big Ten.
But when the clock ran out, it was 
Michigan State cutting down the nets.
“We weren’t poised when we needed 
to,” said Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“We needed to be poised at the time and 
we weren’t. We didn’t show.”
It started out well for the Wolverines. 
Junior guard Zavier Simpson grabbed 
steals on back-to-back possessions to 
open the game, which led to five quick 
points.
Michigan didn’t trail the rest of 
the half. But freshman forward Ignas 
Brazdeikis and sophomore forward 
Isaiah Livers each picked up two fouls, 
sitting on the bench for much of the 
period and thrusting the bench into 
action. All of them played well for 
patches, but the Breslin Center is not a 
conducive environment for freshmen 
with scarce playing time.
The Spartans closed the half on 
a 6-0 run that coincided with a 3:12 
scoring drought for the Wolverines. The 
crowd rose to its feet multiple times 
as Michigan seemed more and more 
flustered. Though the Wolverines led by 
six at halftime, there was a sense it might 
not last.

After a few minutes of trading baskets 
with Michigan, Michigan State found 
a little bit of separation. With 11:39 left 
in the second half, Goins got the ball on 
a fast break and was left wide open for 
three, hitting it to cut the lead to two.
“(We had) a couple possessions of 
miscommunications,” Livers said. “ 
… Just getting them easy shots, easy 
buckets. Just, they didn’t have the 
pressure that we were supposed to give 
them.”
After taking the lead on a Winston 
3-pointer, the Spartans systematically 
suffocated the Wolverines. Michigan 
missed 
eight 
consecutive 
shots 
as 
Michigan State hit 10 in a row, starting 
with Goins’ triple.
When the Wolverines finally took a 
timeout with 7:45 left, the Spartans were 
up seven and had a lead they wouldn’t 
relent. Winston, meanwhile, bullied 
Michigan into submission. He drew 
several fouls and got what he wanted 
at the rim, finishing with 23 points and 
seven assists.
Everything 
the 
Wolverines 
tried 
came up empty. Everything the Spartans 
tried found the net. Michigan’s scoring 
drought ballooned to 4:15 and Michigan 
State’s run to 20-2. Brazdeikis, who 
scored 20 points in just 22 minutes, 
fouled out with just over five minutes 
left.
“It started from the defensive end,” 
said freshman guard David DeJulius. 
“Because the first half, a lot of our 
defensive end translated to offense and 
we were able to get down a lot and then 
the second half we just couldn’t get no 
stops.”
The rest was a mere formality.
For 30 minutes, the title was within 
the Wolverines’ grasp. But for the last 
10, the Spartans played like conference 
champions, and Michigan played like 
a team that had already lost.

E

AST LANSING — Jordan 
Poole stood in a back hall-
way that snakes around the 
Breslin Center talking to a scrum of 
reporters that went three deep. You 
could barely hear him over the sound 
of Queen’s We Are 
the Champions.
“They were just 
able to get runs 
and make shots in 
the second half,” 
he said. “And we 
didn’t answer.”
Fifteen minutes 
later, the Wolver-
ines left the build-
ing. The Spartans 
had yet to leave 
the court. As one team boarded its 
bus lamenting what could — what 
should — have been, the other 
climbed ladders and cut down nets, 
milling around to take in the scene, 
wanting to stay and take it in.
Well over an hour after the 
final buzzer, they stayed — family 
members and players and coaches 
and people who had some type of 
indiscernible tie to Michigan State 
basketball — because the Spartans 
beat Michigan, 75-63, 
taking a champion-
ship trophy straight 
from the Wolverines’ 
hands.
This was supposed 
to be Michigan’s 
celebration and 
Michigan’s trophy. 
If things went the 
way they were sup-
posed to, this game 
wouldn’t have been 
played for anything 
but pride.
Fourteen months ago in the same 
building, Poole walked down the 
tunnel jawing at the Izzone after 

a win. On Sunday, he chewed on a 
towel with a sullen look on his face, 
walking to the losing locker room as 
the celebration started behind him, a 
reminder of an opportunity lost.
Michigan played the first half with 
two of its stars in foul trouble and a 
third, Charles Matthews, sitting on 
the bench with an injury. It took a 
six-point lead into the break anyway. 
That was supposed to be the disaster 
it averted on the way to a title.
In the second half, though, with 
Ignas Brazdeikis and Jon Teske 
back on the floor, the Wolverines fell 
apart. Up 50-45 with 12 minutes to 
go, they let up a 20-2 run, looking 
shell-shocked and lost as Breslin’s 
pressure-cooker burst.
“I think we imploded a little bit on 
a couple of occasions,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein. “They blocked 
a couple shots during that time, and 
that was huge. And then we missed 
some shots. We even had a couple 
airballs. That’s really tough for us.
“Now, they’re out and they didn’t 
miss on their end. We lost some cov-
erages in transition. They put you 
in great rotations. We tried to stay 
on that more than we did last time. 
They got to the foul-
line like crazy.”
That implosion 
cost the Wolverines a 
regular-season cham-
pionship. But really, it 
shouldn’t have come 
down to Saturday in 
the first place.
Seventeen games 
into the season, 
Michigan was 17-0. 
Had it won the 18th, 
the Wolverines would 
have likely ascended to the top rank-
ing in the country.
And 10 games into Big Ten play, 
Michigan was 9-1, firmly in the 

driver’s seat. The lack of a banner 
commemorating it has less to do with 
Saturday than Jon Teske getting into 
foul trouble in Iowa, the entire team 
coming out flat at Penn State and a 
blown lead against the Spartans the 
first time around.
“It’s a missed opportunity,” said 
assistant coach DeAndre Haynes. 
“But the better team won.”
He was talking about Saturday’s 
game. He might as well have been 
talking about the last six weeks.
Right now, this isn’t the same 
team that went to Villanova and ran 
the national champions off their 
home floor, and it isn’t the same team 
that made Roy Williams stand at a 
podium in November and rant that 
his Tar Heels “sucked.”
Michigan started this season 
by messing with every opponent’s 
psyche, winning with style. As 
Saturday’s game wound down, the 
Wolverines needing buckets in the 
biggest moment of their season, they 
had nobody to go to, no consistent 
answer. Across the floor, the Spar-
tans’ bench whooped and hollered 
as Cassius Winston played just that 
role, scoring 16 points with four 
assists in the last 20 minutes, putting 
the whole building on a string.
There are flashes that Michigan 
can be the same team again. Just 
look to the first 28 or so minutes of 
both games against Michigan State. 
The potential for a deep NCAA Tour-
nament remains. “We’re pretty good 
at winning,” Beilein said Saturday, 
and even after a crushing loss, he has 
a point.
But as good as the Wolverines 
started — this game and this season 
— it’s the finish that counts.

NATALIE STEPHENSN/Daily
 Michigan coach John Beilein said the Wolverines “imploded a little bit,” losing poise late in Saturday’s 75-63 loss at Michigan State.

Winston 
bests 
Simpson, 
leads MSU

EAST LANSING — Zavier Simpson 
sat on the bench with a blank stare. 33.9 
seconds remained in Saturday’s game and 
Cassius Winston stood at midcourt, egging 
on the crowd as Aaron Henry walked to 
the free throw line to put the final touches 
on a championship season.
When the buzzer sounded, Michigan 
State beating Michigan 75-63 and winning 
a share of the Big Ten regular-season title, 
Winston found Spartan guard Foster Loyer 
and jumped straight into him. Simpson 
stood in the handshake line stoically, 
watching the scene unfold.
Two weeks ago in Ann Arbor, Winston 
got the best of Simpson, playing all 40 
minutes, scoring 27 points and putting 
up eight assists, leading Michigan State 
to an upset win on the road. On Saturday, 
Winston threw a pass out of bounds as the 
Wolverines held a four-point lead with 
15:30 to go and his face locked up like a kid 
getting bullied on the playground.
That was Winston’s third turnover, 
after a first half in which he scored just 
seven points, shot 1-of-5 from the field 
and sat eight minutes after getting into 
foul trouble. The seesaw in this one-on-
one rivalry, it seemed, had tilted towards 
Simpson.
Five minutes later, it tilted right back.
With the game tied and the Breslin 
Center reaching a fever pitch, Winston 
pulled up for three. It banked in. That was 
Michigan State’s first lead of the game — a 
lead it would never squander, as Winston 
held the rest of the game in the palm of his 
hand.
“I believe it was a confidence thing,” said 
freshman guard David DeJulius. “First 
half, we kinda got under his skin a little bit. 
Big runs. And then second half, he kinda 
got a little groove going. When you let good 
players get a groove, sometimes it can be 
difficult to stop.”
Winston was all but impossible to stop. 
He found passing lanes through traps 
and impossible angles, hit floaters over 
the 7-foot Jon Teske and meandered his 
way into the lane at will, wreaking havoc. 
The Wolverines tried committing every 
defender they had to bumping Winston 30 
feet from the basket, fully in desperation 
mode down by 10 with a minute to go. He 
kept the ball on a string, refusing to turn 
it over, then, from an impossible angle, 
hit a wide-open Matt McQuaid under the 
basket for a dunk.

By that point, Simpson had left the 
game for good. Winston didn’t want to sit, 
calling for the ball to dribble out the clock 
and, when Tom Izzo called timeout with 13 
seconds left to honor the Spartans’ seniors, 
Winston stayed on the floor with the walk-
ons and reserves.
He wanted to savor this win — one in 
his building, for his team, over his rival, 
for a championship he earned. Winston 
scored 16 points with four assists in the 
second half, playing all 20 minutes as the 
deciding force, capping a season that will 
likely culminate in a Big Ten Player of the 
Year award.
“Boy, like the reason he is, to me, the 
most valuable player in this league, is 
because when it was winning time, he 
made some winning plays,” said Michigan 
State coach Tom Izzo. “That’s what great 
players do. He did it, and I’m really proud 
of him.”
In the Michigan locker room, Simpson 
stood up and took the blame. “I gotta do 
better guys,” DeJulius recalled him saying. 
“It’s my fault.”
Simpson has been the Wolverines’ ethos, 
and the personal rivalry with Winston one 
of the linchpins by which his character 
has been constructed, for the last two 
seasons. He doesn’t get beat on defense, 
and certainly not by Winston.
And yet, twice in two weeks, that’s 
exactly what’s happened. Otherwise, it 
might be Michigan celebrating a Big Ten 
title right now.
“We didn’t do a good job of stopping 
(Winston) from turning the corner,” said 
assistant coach DeAndre Haynes. “Even 
Zavier being the defensive guy that he 
is, we couldn’t stop him from turning 
the corner. He turned the corner at will, 
anytime he wanted to on our bigs or our 
point guards.
“He was just a problem to deal with 
tonight. Best player on the floor.”

‘M’ blows title chance

Spartans will their way to 75-63 comeback win

EAST LANSING — Isaiah Livers 
paused. Then he shook his head.
A reporter had just asked how it felt 
to get so close to winning the Big Ten 
regular-season title. The sophomore 
forward was understandably at a loss.
But the Michigan men’s basketball 
team wasn’t just close in the sense 
that, in the last game of the season, 
it was competing for a conference 
championship. With three minutes left in 
the first half, the Wolverines were up 12, 
the title firmly within their grasp.
And 
then, 
methodically, 
their 
championship 
hopes 
collapsed 
as 
Michigan State took over. What began 
with two steals by junior guard Zavier 
Simpson and an ice-cold 3-pointer from 
freshman forward Ignas Brazdeikis 
ended with chants of “Little Sister,” 
a postgame playing of “One Shining 
Moment” and a litany of Spartans still on 
the floor an hour after the buzzer, little 
pieces of the net tied in their “Big Ten 
Champions” hats.
Michigan State officially took the lead 
with 10:47 left in the second half. But the 
problems began before then.
“What won the game for us was 
only being down six at halftime,” 
said Michigan State coach Tom Izzo. 
“Because it could’ve been 16, and that was 
a big difference in the game.”
At times, Michigan seemed on the 
verge of running away with the game, 
but it never quite broke through. The first 

crack was foul trouble.
Livers, Brazdeikis and junior center 
Jon Teske all picked up fouls in the first 
eight minutes. Teske was sent to the 
bench. Livers and Brazdeikis stayed in, 
but two minutes more and they forced 
Michigan coach John Beilein’s hand by 
picking up a second.
The rest of the half, a mishmash of 
freshmen and seldom-used bench players 
rounded out the rotation. All held their 
own, but their inexperience prevented 
the Wolverines from building their lead 
— and by the end of the half, when the 
Spartans had whittled the deficit to six, it 
seemed the lid was about to blow off the 
pressure cooker.
And when the starters came back in 
after the half, they were no longer in the 
same perfect sync.
“You get in foul trouble, it messes up 
your rhythm,” Livers said. “You finally 
get back in the game, so when you sit 
out a long time in the first half, there’s 
no excuse but we get out there, it’s just, 
you’re not in the same rhythm as when 
you left.”
Michigan never got back in its groove. 
The Wolverines scored 13 points in the 
first eight minutes, then went seven 
minutes and 20 seconds without another 
field goal. It was eerily similar to Feb. 24 in 
Ann Arbor, when a five-minute field goal 
drought let a Michigan lead slip away.
In each game, sophomore guard 
Jordan Poole sunk a few shots to keep 
things slightly interesting — but both 
times, it was too little, too late.
With five minutes left on Saturday, 

Michigan State was up 10. Brazdeikis, 
the Wolverines’ only reliable scorer, had 
fouled out just seconds before.
“We haven’t scored (a field goal) in 
seven minutes,” Livers said. “So I kinda 
just, it was kinda bad and I feel like at that 
point, a couple guys started cracking and 
that’s, can’t do that … against your rival.”
As Michigan struggled to find the 
basket, Spartan guard Cassius Winston 
went off, dribbling through defenders 
and dazzling at the rim en route to 23 
points. Forward Xavier Tillman blocked 
five shots, wreaking havoc when the 
Wolverines’ smaller guards tried to get to 
the rim. Michigan’s early energy had fully 
transferred to Michigan State.
The Wolverines aren’t a team that 
frequently loses their composure. As 
Beilein was quick to point out, they’ve 
won 
in 
tough 
road 
environments 
before — Villanova’s Finneran Pavilion, 
Minnesota’s 
Williams 
Arena 
and 
Maryland’s Xfinity Center, to name a 
few. But none of those had the stakes, or 
the sensory overload, of Saturday’s game 
at Breslin. And none of those teams were 
the caliber of the Spartans, who showed 
in the last matchup just how quickly they 
can suck the life out of you.
“We did not lose our poise in all seven 
of our road wins,” Beilein said. “We lost 
some poise today.”
Michigan was that close, leading the 
game it needed to win with just over 10 
minutes to go. But as the Wolverines’ 
poise crumbled in the Breslin Center 
whiteout, what remained of their title 
hopes slipped through their fingers.

Lack of composure haunts Michigan on road

We needed to 
be poised at the 
time and we 
weren’t.

(Winston) was 
just a problem 
to deal with 
tonight.

I think we 
imploded a little 
bit on a couple 
occasions.
