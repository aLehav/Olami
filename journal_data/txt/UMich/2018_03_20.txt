BUSINESS

Less than two weeks after 

the mass shooting at Marjory 
Stoneman Douglas High School 
in Parkland, Fla., more than a 
dozen corporations, including 
Delta 
Airlines, 
MetLife 
and 

Hertz cut ties with the National 
Rifle Association. Ann Arbor 
businesses 
like 
Bivouac, 
an 

outdoor clothing and supplies 
store, are following suit. These 
companies will no longer offer a 
discount to NRA members, and 
many asked for their information 
to be removed from the NRA 
website.

After the outdoor clothing and 

equipment company REI released 
a statement announcing it would 
no 
longer 
carry 
CamelBak 

products in its stores after it 
discovered CamelBak’s owner, 
Vista Outdoor, is a major firearm 
and ammunition manufacturer 
and failed to make a statement 
following the Parkland shooting. 
Local 
Ann 
Arbor 
business 

Bivouac decided to follow suit 

and agreed to stop carrying 
CamelBak 
products 
after 

concerned customers of Bivouac 
emailed Bivouac Vice President 
AJ Davidson, demanding they 
confront the gun control issue.

“It’s not so much that they 

sell guns — that’s not the issue,” 
Davidson said. “It’s just that after 
these mass shootings, they refuse 
to put out any kind of statement 
or make any kind of change that 
would help prevent these mass 
shootings, and as a company, 
they’re in a prime position to do 
something, or at least issue some 
kind of statement to show that 
they actually care.”

Jerry Davis, associate dean for 

Business and Impact at the Ross 
School of Business, has written 
several 
books 
on 
corporate 

activism, and most recently, an 
article for The Conversation. 
Given the speed and volume of 
companies severing ties with the 
NRA, Davis said he found this 
wave of corporate activism to be 
unprecedented.

boycott, it took two days (for

City Council appoints members 
to local police review task force

Controversy arises over Mayor Taylor’s omission of task force member at meeting

Monday 
night, 
in 
the 

culmination of years of the 
public 
calling 
for 
increased 

accountability of the Ann Arbor 
Police Department, Ann Arbor 
City Council finalized a roster 
for a task force to develop a police 
review board.

In response to recent racist 

incidents in Ann Arbor, including 
the shooting of Aura Rosser by a 
white police officer in 2014 and 

the Blake Transit Center incident, 
where a Black teen was dragged 
into the bus station and put in 
handcuffs, Transforming Justice 
Washtenaw has continued to 
press for increased transparency 
and accountability for the AAPD. 
Amid pressure from TJW, the 
council had previously decided to 
assemble a task force in order to 
establish parameters for a police 
review board with the perspective 
of everyday citizens, especially 
those with unique insights such 
as affected minorities and social 
workers.

With a list of 13 recommended 

members from the Human Rights 
Commission and two alternates, 
the council settled on 11 members 
for the task force. Among the 11 
individuals, the council selected 
HRC member Dwight Wilson, 
high school student Keyshon 
Cotton as well as three task force 
members who have Ann Arbor 
addresses, but reside in Pittsfield 
Township, Scio Township and 
Ypsilanti.

Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher 

Taylor emphasized the diversity 
of the task force, saying the force 

includes active HRC members, 
a member from the LGBTQ 
community, social workers, public 
defenders, civil rights attorneys 
and community educators.

“The 
resolution 
asked 
for 

increased diversity, and I believe 
that we have it,” Taylor said. “The 
task force is majority women 
which I believe is a good thing and 
majority-minority which I also 
believe to be a good thing.”

Though the council seemed 

to accept many of the HRC’s 
recommendations, taking nine of

Parties running for executive 

positions 
on 
University 
of 

Michigan 
Central 
Student 

Government met Monday night 
and discussed their platforms 
in a debate hosted by CSG in the 
Rogel Ballroom of the Michigan 
Union. The presidential and vice 
presidential 
candidates 
from 

MVision, 
MomentUM, 
True 

Blue, eMpower, aMplify, Let’s 
Keep Michigan Time, Defending 
Affirmative Action Party and 
Serfdom USA discussed their 
party platforms and their goals 
for the upcoming year. CSG’s prior 
successes and failures, issues 
of discrimination, and campus 
affordability were some of the 
topics addressed at the event.

The debate began with each 

party 
introducing 
themselves 

and their platforms. Engineering 
freshman 
Noah 
Tappen, 

Let’s Keep Michigan Time’s 
presidential 
candidate, 
began 

by thanking CSG for inviting 
all the parties to participate in 
the debate. His comment was 
in reference to The Daily only 
hosting five of the larger parties 
to participate in the debate held 
last Thursday.

“I want to thank you for having 

me at this event, as you may know, 
me and two of the other running 
parties weren’t invited to the first 
debate — it’s a shame,” Tappen 
said. 

The first half of the debate 

consisted of questions formulated 

by CSG, and each party was 
allotted one minute to formulate 
a response.

Another one of the parties who 

was not at The Daily’s debate on 
Thursday was the Serfdom USA 
party. 
Presidential 
candidate 

Liam Stewart, an LSA junior, 
explained the parties platform to 
establish a “feudal society” at the 
University.

“I 
support 
diversity,” 

Stewart said. “I want nobles 

to be representing the LGBTQ 
community, I want nobles to be 
representing ethnic and racial 
minority communities, I want 
nobles to be representing non-
gender binary communities. I 
want nobles to be representing 
every single aspect we have on 
campus.”

The first question posed to 

each party asked what they 
saw as CSG’s biggest successes 
and disappointments this past 

year. MVision praised last year’s 
CSG for demonstrating what 
diverse leadership looked like. 
However, LSA sophomore Izzy 
Baer, MVision vice presidential 
candidate, 
pointed 
out 
the 

continued need to talk about 
“invisible identities” in order to 
create a campus supportive of the 
student body.

“I think one of the biggest 

improvements we can draw on is

The University of Michigan’s 

Academic Reporting Tool released 
its grade distribution feature over 
the weekend, allowing students 
to explore grade distributions of 
courses before registration. The 
new feature caters to the voices 
of many students, according to 
Innovation Advocacy Lead Amy 
Homkes-Hayes.

“As you can imagine, students 

have asked for us to show course 
information 
in 
a 
University-

sanctioned tool,” Homkes-Hayes 
said.

The 
Office 
of 
Academic 

Innovation created ART 2.0 in 2016 
and has been adding new features 
and mechanisms to aid students 
ever since, listing 9,273 University 
courses. The Office of Academic 
Innovation works closely with the 
Office of the Provost, individual 
schools and colleges, the Senate 
Advisory Committee on University 
Affairs 
and 
Central 
Student 

Government to identify what kind 
of academic data would be most 
helpful to the student body.

University Council assembled 

Monday night to discuss the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 

academic calendar and Election 
Day.

The meeting started with 

a 
presentation 
from 
Sarah 

Daniels, 
associate 
dean 
of 

students, Lisa Emery, senior 
associate 
registrar, 
and 

Christine 
Gerdes, 
special 

counsel to the provost. They 
spoke about the possibility 
of 
starting 
the 
2020-2021 

academic year before Labor 

Day. Without this revision, the 
last day of the fall semester 
could be as late as Dec. 24, 2020, 
creating travel difficulties as 
students scramble to get home 
before Christmas.

The 
conversation 
then 

turned to whether it would 
be better to have a longer Fall 
Break or a longer Thanksgiving 
Break. Daniels asked the group 
about their uses of Fall Break. 
Public Policy senior Sammi 
Lawrence, representative for 
the Ford School of Public Policy, 
spoke about how especially 
as a freshman, Fall Break was 
incredibly important.

“Thinking back to when I 

was a freshman, that natural 
break in the middle, where 
everything is so hectic: starting 
new classes, new environment, 
massive school … To have just 
a couple days was incredibly 
beneficial,” Lawrence said. 

For 
freshman 
and 

upperclassmen alike, Fall Break 
is vital for students’ mental 
health. CSG Vice President 
Nadine Jawad, a Public Policy 
senior, emphasized this point.

“There is an extra push during 

those two days for students to 
take care of themselves,” Jawad 
said. 

Business senior Grace Nasr, 

representative for the Ross 

School of Business, and 
Rackham student Kirstie 
Hostetter, representative for 
the School for Environment 
and 
Sustainability, 
also 

noted the importance of 
Fall Break from a career 
standpoint, as both schools 
utilize those two extra days 
to find internships and use 
them as a career check.

Daniels 
ended 
the 

presentation by highlighting 
the fight to fit everything 
into the calendar.

“It’s all part of one big 

puzzle,” Daniels said. “We 
are not in a place where 
it’s a kind of ‘We’ll give you 
this if we get this’ situation. 
It’s not that give and take 
per se, it’s kind of all these 
things are on the table … 
It’s (seeing) how we can 
fit the pieces together so 
that it fits the needs of all 
constituents.” 

The 
second 
half 
of 

the meeting focused on 
Election Day, with Law 
School student Tom Allen, a 
representative for Promote 
the Vote. The Fall Break 

debate was revisited, since it 
had been previously noted that 
Election Day should potentially 
be a day off, instead of one of 
the two Fall Break days. Allen 
 

noted the “pathetically low 
voter turnout” among the age 
group 
composed 
of 
college 

students.

The Council came to the 

consensus this low turnout was 
largely due to the three-hour 
wait at the Michigan Union 
or other local voting centers, 
which interferes with classes 
for students and professors 
alike.

Allen said students are often 

put in a situation where they are 
“deciding between going to class 
or waiting in line.” Allen further 
spoke about other reforms to 
Michigan election laws, which 
he noted are some of the most 
restrictive in the country.

“Students, for their first time 

voting, have to be in person,” 
Allen 
said. 
“This 
revision 

would allow anybody to get an 
absentee ballot for any reason, 
even if it’s just that you are 
working all day and don’t have 
time to get to the polls. It’s all 
sort of common sense reform 
… To make it as easy as possible 
for everyone to vote.

For the Daily

There is an extra 
push during those 

two days for 

students to take 

care of themselves


talking about and creating policies 
for invisible identities on campus 
— survivors of sexual assault, 
students of low (socioeconomic 
status), members of the LGBT 
community,” Baer said. “These 
identities 
are 
not 
as 
seen 

within our assembly right now 
because they aren’t talked about. 
Something we can improve on is 
talking about policies and cultures 
surrounding these groups on 
campus and with that, that’s how 
we create platforms and policies 
that positively affect them.”

MomentUM 
lauded 
voter 

registration as one of CSG’s 
greatest successes from the past 
year. However, vice presidential 
candidate 
Charlie 
Bingham, 

an LSA junior, pointed out the 
tokenization of minorities as one of 
the largest failures in CSG.

“I think the biggest failure of 

CSG is we still, in this organization, 
have a culture that makes students 
of color feel that they are only 
wanted because of the color of 
their skin,” Bingham said. “We still 
have representatives sitting on this 
assembly right now who have done 
incredible work who feel they have 
been used in this election to get 
votes — that is not acceptable.”

The debate went on to focus 

on what each party viewed as the 

most relevant issues facing the 
campus, which were also within 
CSG’s power to control. 

Let’s Keep Michigan Time 

called on CSG to use their influence 
on campus to speak out against 
issues like gun control through 
forms of organized protests.

“CSG has so much power, CSG 

can organize protests not just at 
the University but of Washtenaw 
County and the area to keep us 
safe,” Tappen said. “Gun control 
isn’t a huge issue just for school 
shootings but suicides too. Gun 
control is by far probably one of the 
biggest issue affecting us and CSG 
has the power as an organization 
to be protesting, going against the 
norm and saying what we really 
want.”

The Defend Affirmative Action 

Party followed on the theme of 
national issues and emphasized 
their stance on raising awareness 
about issues of discrimination, 
immigration and sexism with CSG 
influence.

“The school needs to send out 

a warning if ICE (Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement) is 
on campus, they need to protect 
our profs, they need to protect 
our students that are remanding 
residence,” LSA senior Lauren 
Kay, 
the 
Defend 
Affirmative 

Action Party candidate, said. “It’s 
unacceptable that they do not 
already do things like this.” 

The next question asked about 

the kind of relationship each 
party sought to have with the 
University 
administration 
and 

Board of Regents. Law School 
student 
Matthew 
Williams, 

vice presidential candidate for 
aMplify, discussed their party’s 
hope to leverage their ties with 
the administration in order to 
establish a partnership, which 
would then allow them to pass 
resolutions.

“If 
we’re 
going 
to 
move 

forward, we’re going to move 
forward in partnership with the 
administration,” Williams said. 
“They have power to block our 
initiatives, and we have to be able 
to partner with them.” 

However, Kay had a less 

diplomatic approach to dealing 
with the administration. The party 
emphasized their desire to ensure 
the University complies with the 
wishes of the student body, and not 
vice versa.

“How are we going to work with 

the administration?” Kay said. 
“The administration has to work 
for us first. We do not deny our own 
power, the anti-war movement, the 
civil rights movement, the various 
campus protests of the 1960s and 
1970s the students took action and 
power into their own hands and 
didn’t ask for the administration to 
give them permission.”

corporations to sever relationships 
with the NRA),” Davis said. 
“Amazing. Nothing happens in 
two days, but two dozen companies 
basically cut ties with the NRA on 
the threat of a boycott, not even an 
actual boycott. So that just seemed 
pretty remarkable.”

While Davis said corporations 

typically shy away from political 
statements, it becomes increasingly 
difficult to avoid taking a stand 
in 
2018. 
With 
social 
media, 

consumers have a louder voice, 
making corporate practices and 
partnerships much more visible 
and subject to scrutiny.

“The speed of concerns or 

grievances to go viral or to become 
really 
well-known, 
that’s 
the 

biggest one,” Davis said. “The fact 
that Applebee’s fires a hostess 
because she posted something 
funny 
about 
a 
customer 
on 

Instagram, and this becomes 
some (issue of controversy) with 
thousands 
of 
people 
flooding 

Applebee’s 
with 
negative 

comments. That couldn’t happen 
before social media.”

Though social media has had a 

monumental effect in corporations 
renouncing the NRA recently, 
several 
mass 
shootings 
have 

occurred in the age of Twitter 
and Facebook without the same 
response from businesses. This 
time is different, as Stoneman 
Douglas students have gone viral 
for their videos, speeches and social 
media posts for the #NeverAgain 
movement, challenging powerful 
adults in Washington, D.C. and 
the NRA. Davis noted the role of 
the Parkland survivors has likely 

changed the conversation.

“The narrative seems to be that 

this is an unusually well-spoken 
group of kids that were clearly 
victims of this life-changing event, 
and they were speaking from an 
untarnished place,” Davis said. “It 
wasn’t that they came in with an 
agenda. They did not choose to be 
in this situation, and now they’re 
trying to find a way out of it. And 
that just has a moral clarity that’s 
hard to find.”

In the wake of the Parkland 

shooting, 
Dick’s 
Sporting 

Goodsannounced that it would no 
longer sell firearms or ammunition 
to anyone under 21 and that it 
would also end its sales of assault-
style rifles.

Though LSA junior Ryan Roose 

said he was encouraged to hear 
about Dick’s Sporting Goods’s 
statement, this same act can turn 
other customers away.

“My brothers and I talked about 

how Dick’s is doing that, we thought 
it was good, and we just supported 
that, and we want to shop more at 
their stores now,” Roose said. “We 
had friends that they didn’t want to 
shop there anymore because they 
didn’t think that Dick’s should be 
making political stances.”

While Davidson said Bivouac 

vocally supports environmental 
nonprofits, such as the Leslie 
Science and Nature Center and the 
Conservation Resource Alliance, 
they do not make overtly political 
statements or support political 
candidates as a business. Davidson 
echoed Roose’s concerns about 
deterring individuals with differing 
political opinions from purchasing 
products from Bivouac and said 
there’s a balance businesses have 
to strike to be competitive but also 
speak out on issues.

“It’s always a fine line of, once 

again, we feel like we know there 
are two beliefs on some things, and 
as a business you don’t want to do 
too much to discourage a group of 
people from shopping in the store,” 
Davidson said.

Part of toeing the fine line for 

Bivouac is giving customers the 
option to support different social 
causes. At the checkout line, 
customers can buy a Pincause pin 
for causes such as the National 
Student Walkout, the Women’s 
March and animal rescue. Though 
some consumers want companies 
to tread lightly on politics, Roose 
said he wants corporations to be 
openly political because he wants 
to align his shopping choices with 
his ideology.

“I 
definitely 
prefer 
when 

companies come out and make 
political statements,” Roose said. “I 
think users, for one, should know 
what their company stands for, and 
I think companies should be able to 
stand for what they want.”

While some consumers, like 

Roose, enjoy forthright political 
stances from companies, Davidson 
said Bivouac tries to support its 
values without being too “in your 
face.” However, he also said U.S. 
gun violence is not an issue in 
which to remain silent.

“I think there are certain issues 

that are so important and so big and 
so crucial to the future of America 
that at some point you got to say 
something, and you’ve got to take 
a stand somewhere,” Davidson 
said. “And I think this is one of 
those issues where it’s getting out 
of control. We need to start making 
change, so we’re going to do what 
we can do, as small as it might be, 
to show where we stand and where 
our values are.”

representative 
elections. 

Six assembly members were 
nominated to fill the three 
seats being vacated at the end 
of April by SACUA members 
Dave 
Wright 
and 
Stefan 

Szymanski, and SACUA Chair 
Robert Ortega. All nominated 
assembly members presented 
a short speech to the Assembly 
immediately 
preceding 
the 

vote. 
Currently, 
only 
two 

women sit on SACUA, but 
beginning April 30, five of the 
nine members will be women.

At the close of the meeting, 

assembly members were given 
the opportunity to vote, and 
after the ballots were counted, 
Colleen Conway, Sarah Lippert 
and Deirdre Spencer were 
awarded the three seats.

Conway, professor of music 

education, noted in her speech 
that she works in the School 
of Education as well as in 
the School of Music, Theatre 
and Dance, which broadens 
her 
understanding 
and 

connections across the school. 

She 
also 
has student 

teachers working in schools 
across the area, which she 
attributed to her knowledge 
of the region and offering her 
additional perspectives.

“I also believe that my work 

specifically 
with 
education 

crosses over the boundaries,” 
Conway said. “Most of my 
colleagues in the School of 
Music, Theatre and Dance are 
in the creative arts areas only.”

Lippert, associate professor 

of art history, and the only 
nominee from the U-M Flint 
campus, spoke to the lack 
of representation from her 
campus.

“As 
a 
matter 
of 
fair 

representation, it is time for 
Flint to have a seat at the 
table,” Lippert said.

Lippert is the chair of the 

Tri-Campus 
Task 
Force, 
a 

board 
of 
representatives 

from all three University of 
Michigan campuses aimed at 
improving faculty governance.

“Recent 
newsworthy 

events means that our place 
within the institution needs 
to be heard, and we hope that 
(SACUA) contact will help us 
overcome our challenges that 

are unique to the Flint campus, 
as students and as community 
partners,” Lippert said.

Deirdre Spencer, librarian 

for History of Art, emphasized 
in her speech she always 
lobbies for resources for the 
Flint and Dearborn campuses, 
and highlighted racial tension 
and bigotry on campus. All 
three campuses have suffered 
spates of racist vandalism and 
bias incidents in year following 
the 2016 presidential election. 

“Historically, the University 

of Michigan is a champion for 
cause of humanity and social 
justice,” Spencer said. “This 
has led to the creation of new 
areas of scholarship, and new 
programs and services, which 
have benefitted many. As a 
university, we have come so far 
and done so much. But progress 
is cyclical. Each generation 
fights new versions of the 
same battle. For excellence to 
continue during this period 
of 
escalating 
uncertainty, 

representative leadership is 
needed.”

Conway, 
Lippert 
and 

Spencer will serve three-year 
terms on SACUA.

to bust myths that students cannot 
do well in certain classes. With 
this data, students can evaluate the 
difficulty of courses and evaluate 
when they should take a course 
and how to best build a schedule 
that works for them.

“When we talk about ART 

2.0, one of the things we talk 
about is myth-busting,” Homkes-
Hayes 
said. 
“Our 
intent 
to 

show (grade distributions) was 
because students demonstrated 
they wanted to see it and we can 
de-mysticize 
any 
information 

about how grades are distributed.”

The ART 2.0 team worked 

directly 
with 
Vice 
Provost 

James Holloway’s office in order 
to develop the tool and utilize 
accurate data. For example, they 
will only show substantiated data 
in classes with enough information 
to do so in regards to instructor 
ratings and scores so in a class 
with fewer grade samples, the 
distribution doesn’t deter students 
from registering for certain classes 
with smaller class size caps.

“We are being really intentional 

about what has been shown and 
we will follow the guidelines of the 
Provost’s office in order to do so,” 
Homkes-Hayes said.

The 
Office 
of 
Academic 

Innovation continually engages 
with students and faculty to 
identify the future areas where 
they can help students. Homkes-

Hayes 
mentioned 
potential 

alumni data for showing students 
pathways they can take following 
degree completion as an idea for 
future ART 2.0 updates.

Engineering 
junior 
Kevin 

Zheng works with the program, 
analyzing the data ART 2.0 collects 
and comparing the grades between 
schools, subjects and courses. He 
also works to improve interfaces 
for instructors to get feedback 
from students. Zheng pointed out 
the workload metric could provide 
skewed results because students in 
difficult, lower-level courses have a 
high proportion of students rating 
it as “high workload” but higher-
level, more self-selective courses 
are less likely to have this workload 
rating.”

“Providing grade distributions 

is 
especially 
useful 
because 

students can use it in conjunction 
with the workload metric,” Zheng 
wrote. “In some situations, the 
workload metric is less useful 
under the assumption that students 
in different levels of a subject may 
perceive 
workload 
differently. 

Grade distributions help to reduce 
some of this uncertainty.”

Zheng uses ART 2.0 during 

backpacking and registration and 
said the new grade distribution 
element helps him evaluate which 
courses to take. He checks ART’s 
student evaluations, instruction 
evaluations, class size outputs and 
which courses students take before 
or during this course.

“I use ART during backpacking 

and registration all the time,” 

Zheng wrote. “Grade distributions 
would fit nicely into my workflow 
using ART to evaluate whether 
a course is a good fit for me. I 
imagine myself looking at the grade 
distributions to help balance my 
workload so that I don’t overload 
myself.”

Despite 
excitement 
from 

students, faculty members have 
historically had some concerns 
about 
the 
tool, 
which 
was 

originally only available to faculty 
members. 
When 
the 
original 

tool premiered in 2016, SACUA 
member and Kinesiology Professor 
Stephen Symanski said he was 
worried the effectiveness of ART 
2.0 would change when it opened 
to user input. 

“Among people of goodwill, 

there are never problems really,” 
Szymanski said. “But sadly, we are 
not 100 percent goodwill.”

According 
to 
Tim 
McKay, 

LSA professor and director of the 
Digital Innovation Greenhouse, 
some faculty members also think 
making grade distribution data 
available may lead students to 
chose classes based solely on that 
information. 

“There is little evidence, on any 

campus, that this actually happens, 
but I think it’s a well intended 
concern,” McKay wrote in an email 
to The Daily. “Personally, I trust 
students to consider information 
like this wisely — at least as wisely 
as anyone would.

the 13 recommended members, 
TJW 
continued 
to 
press 

for changes in the council’s 
resolution.

In a press release, TJW 

called the council to task, 
demanding the council establish 
TJW member Lori Saginaw as 
chair of the task force. Several 
Ann Arbor citizens called for 
Saginaw’s instatement as chair, 
including Amory Vhou, who 
praised Saginaw’s leadership 
abilities.

“As chair, she will elicit and 

synthesize 
everyone’s 
best 

contributions,” Vhou said.

In 
a 
last-minute 
change 

prior to the meeting, Taylor 
attempted to appease TJW by 
placing Saginaw as a co-chair 
with University of Michigan 
Law School professor Richard 
Friedman.

Amid contention over the 

selection process for the task 
force, 
Taylor 
explained 
his 

selection process by saying not 
only was it a difficult process, 
but there were many factors the 
council took into consideration 
throughout.

“There 
are 
more 
people 

in Ann Arbor with skills and 
abilities than there are places 
to serve and that was the case 
with the task force,” Taylor 

said. “There will be other 
opportunities to serve. Even if 
you weren’t selected your role is 
not done.”

Taylor’s statement, which was 

in reference to the contested 
omission of Shirley Beckley, 
was met with controversy from 
residents as well as council 
members. Councilmember Jack 
Eaton, D-Ward 4, attempted to 
amend the resolution to include 
Beckley by arguing for Beckley’s 
vast experience as an activist in 
Ann Arbor.

“One of the things that have 

driven the process from the very 
beginning is our friend Shirley 
Beckley,” 
Eaton 
said. 
“Ms. 

Beckley has a historical grasp 
on why this community needs to 
have a civilian review process. 
She needs to be a part of the task 
force.”

Despite cheers from the crowd 

at Eaton’s declaration as well as 
support from Councilmembers 
Sumi Kailasapathy, D-Ward 1, 
and Anne Bannister, D-Ward 
1, Eaton’s amendment did not 
pass. 
Taylor 
explained 
his 

reasoning in excluding Beckley, 
referencing an incident from 
more than two years ago when 
Beckley called the council out 
regarding a lack of consequences 
for Officer David Ried after he 
shot and killed Rosser.

“If you won’t at least fire 

officer Ried, then … Let’s string 
him up,” Beckley said in a quote 

to MLive during a previous 
meeting.

Taylor 
said 
Beckley 

disqualified herself from the 
task force through her statement 
of violence towards Ried.

“This drew applause from the 

audience,” Taylor said regarding 
Beckley’s previous statement. 
“A call for violence against an 
officer or a call for violence 
against city staff is unacceptable 
in my view and a disqualification 
for participation.”

Even after the council passed 

the finalized roster for the 
task force — one that excluded 
Beckley 
— 
TJW 
members 

continued to call for Beckley’s 
reinstatement in the task force. 
Saginaw argued Beckley was 
not only a valuable member of 
the task force, but her words and 
anger were understandable.

“We know that Officer Ried 

is not, nor will ever be in danger 
of being lynched by Shirley 
Beckley,” Saginaw said.

Beckley even came to the 

podium to defend herself and 
her statement from more than 
two years ago during the public 
comment session, refusing to 
apologize for her words towards 
Ried.

“Back then it was very hurtful 

to see a Black woman killed and 
not helped, especially when 
she was a mental health patient 
and you all know that,” Beckley 
said. “My ancestors have been 

strung up, lynched, run over, 
babies cut out of their bellies, 
families separated. We’re still 
looking for families. I’m not 
going to apologize for my anger. 
Yes, I’m angry. Yes, I’ve been 
here 75 years. No, I haven’t seen 
any progress. We have made 
progress to have a task force and 
I’m happy about that. It doesn’t 
really matter if I’m on there or 
not. The fact that you did it is a 
plus, and I’m very happy about 
that.”

Despite 
tension 
regarding 

the selection of task force 
members, citizens and council 
members agreed the assembly 
of task force members was a 
long-awaited step in the right 
direction. 
Councilmember 

Graydon Krapohl, D-Ward 4, 
said the AAPD is ready for a 
change.

“I’ve spoken to many within 

the force who are looking 
forward 
to 
this 
process,” 

Krapohl said.

Councilmember Julie Grand, 

D-Ward 3, went on to say the 
next police chief would be 
chosen in line with this vision of 
racial justice in the AAPD.

“We are putting off our search 

for our police chief because we 
respect this process,” Grand 
said. “It will be such a key part 
of the role that we will not even 
post the position until we know 
what this commission will look 
like.”

An open letter to the French Department

RISHABH KEWALRAMANI | COLUMN

E

very time I log on to 
my 
Facebook 
feed, 

I 
usually 
click 
on 

roughly four or five articles 
from publications like Vox or 
Politico. They’ve made it easy 
for me and practically every 
news consumer to read the 
news. With the development 
of the Instant Article on 
Facebook, I can now click 
on specific articles and they 
will open without a load time. 
While traditional outlets have 
tried to adapt by using many of 
these same methods, it’s clear 
that the tide is changing for 
these news sources like our 
local newspaper and national 
media outlets like The New 
York Times. One doesn’t need 
to turn to the “newspaper 
death watch” to know that 
newspapers are in trouble 
from increased competition 
and a changing readership.

Perhaps 
you’re 
one 
of 

the younger millennials like 
myself, who, until recently, 
never had the opportunity 
to pay for news. Like every 
generation before us, we’ve 
grown up reading or watching 
whatever our parents did — 
whether that was the local 
news, CNN or perhaps nothing 
at all. Unlike our predecessors, 
however, when we have earned 
the opportunity to actually 
pay for the news, we have been 
inundated with free media 
options. One could easily be 
informed without ever having 
to pay for a news story. The 
internet dramatically shifted 
how we consume our news on 
top of the websites we visited 
to do so.

With 
the 
change 
from 

print, radio and TV to the 
internet came a dramatic shift 
in ad revenue services. In the 
newspaper industry, it’s fairly 
obvious: The company would 
make money by having you pay 
a nominal subscription fee and 
make more money by selling 

advertisements and space in 
the classified ads. The goal, 
at least theoretically, was to 
write a product so well that 
consumers would pay for it and 
view 
advertisements 
inside 

it. “Page One: Inside the New 
York Times” is a documentary 
about 
the 
newspaper, 
and 

it shows the rollout of the 
paywall online. Before 2010, 
individuals could access the 
news freely, without having 
to pay for an article at all. 
In order to make up for the 
decreasing 
revenue, 
The 

Times decided that making 
readers pay for their articles 
online was paramount to their 
survival, but many consumers 
simply decided to change their 
news source.

This 
phenomenon 
of 

changing news sources came 
from the expectation of not 
having to pay for anything on 
the internet. Because of the 
expectation that consumption 
would be free, users pushed 
back against the idea that 
they would have to pay for a 
news source that could easily 
be 
found 
somewhere 
else. 

And this trend is growing. 
Individuals are increasingly 
turning to social media to get 
their news. A survey from 
Pew Research Center showed 
that the gap between people 
who consume news online 
and those who read print is 
closing dramatically. Another 
statistic from that same survey 

suggests this trend isn’t going 
anywhere either: A majority of 
individuals ages 18 to 29 get 
their news online as of 2017; in 
2016 it was 50 percent.

The concern regarding the 

changing news landscape is 
how critical newspapers have 
been over the past 100 years. 
A segment on “Last Week 
Tonight with John Oliver” 
covered the importance of 
newspaper journalism. In this 
piece, he includes a hearing 
against Google’s ad revenue 
service in 2010, where you 
hear from a public official: It’s 
a great time to be a corrupt 
local politician. And the host 
John Oliver is right to say 
that a large share of coverage 
for the news is derived from 
the 
newspaper 
industry. 

But all over the country, 
newspapers are closing down 
or restructuring. Over the 
past 
10 
years, 
newspaper 

employment has dropped by 
37 percent. This means there 
are fewer journalists to cover 
the perhaps mundane — but 
important — local proceedings 
that oversee the day-to-day 
workings of political life. And 
without that watchdog role 
of those proceedings, it can 
be reasonably assumed that 
corrupt political maneuvers 
could be happening without us 
ever knowing about it.

There 
is 
hope 
for 

newspapers, though. Despite 
these 
closings, 
online 

subscriptions have gone up 
for The Times. No one knows 
exactly where the news is 
heading 
if 
the 
newspaper 

industry collapses, but they’ve 
adapted 
before 
and 
will 

hopefully adapt again. I can 
only hope that the newspaper 
industry finds a way to coexist 
with the digital world.

I

’m writing today because 
I am a good student, but 
I am scared. I’m writing 

today because in all my time 
at the University of Michigan, 
I 
have 
believed 
that 
my 

classes follow the tenets of an 
effective meritocracy where 
one can be successful if he or 
she puts in the work. However, 
that is not the case for one 
program here. Every day when 
the clock turns to 4 p.m., I 
transform 
from 
a 
student 

who thrives to a student who 
struggles to survive. I don’t 
think it would come as any 
surprise to you that French 231 
is my 4 p.m. class. Last week, 
my classmates and I got the 
opportunity to do a midterm 
course evaluation, and we 
relished 
the 
opportunity 

because so many of us honestly 
dread 
walking 
into 
that 

classroom on a daily basis. 
However, when our lecturer 
recapped the review, it quickly 
became clear that nothing 
would change when it came 
to the terrifying structure of 
the French language program 
at this University. However, 
it is important to note that 
the lecturers have very little 
autonomy when it comes to 
the curriculum. Thus, they 
do not bear the brunt of 
the responsibility for these 
shortcomings. 
Nevertheless, 

here are just a few of the 
grievances my classmates and 
I described:

1. 
Workload: 
We 
were 

told at the beginning of the 
semester to expect to spend 
two hours outside of class for 
every hour in class, which 
brings us to an expected eight 
hours a week of just French 
outside of the classroom. On 
most days, my classes go from 
8:30 or 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. With 
the amount of French work 
allotted, that would mean my 
day does not effectively start 
until 7 p.m. At a university 
that aims to create a well-
rounded student and person 
after college, this leaves little 
precious time to do those 
things that would enrich my 
education. Not to mention 
that 
if 
every 
four-credit 

class had the same amount 

of coursework, that would be 
32 hours of outside work, or 
almost a full-time job.

2. 
Flipped 
Classroom: 

A 
flipped 
classroom 
can 

be described as an inverse 
of 
traditional 
learning 

environments, 
where 

students 
learn 
through 

hands-on activities at home 
instead of through lecture. 
I understand that there are 
teaching theories that say 
that a flipped classroom is 
better for learning. However, 
they are without a doubt 
inherently 
unequal 
when 

grades are involved. Just like 
in economic terms where the 

rich can get richer because 
they can invest their wealth, 
students who are “better” at 
French going into the course 
get more out of a flipped 
classroom, because a flipped 
classroom puts the onus on the 
students to learn the language 
themselves. I have no doubt 
in my mind that if you were to 
give a test on the first day of 
class and one on the last day 
of class, the distribution of 
scores would remain the same, 
meaning the highest achiever 
on the first day would most 
likely be the highest achiever 
on the last day. When you take 
grades into account, you could 
tell who was going to get an A 
based on the first day of class.

3. Harsh Grading: When 

compared to other University 
courses and other language 
courses at the University, the 
French grading system comes 
across as truly draconian. In 
French 232 during the Winter 
Semester of 2015, 60 percent 

of students got a B or higher. 
That same number was 87 
percent, 74 percent and 86 
percent for the same level 
class in Italian, Spanish and 
Latin, respectively, and the 
comparison looks worse when 
looking at the number of As 
and A-s. From looking at this 
data, you could reach one of 
two conclusions: either French 
students are objectively worse 
students 
than 
their 
peers 

or the French program as a 
whole is too harsh. In fact, 
in that same semester, only 5 
percent of students received 
an A, or one in 20. That means 
that fewer than one person 
per section got an A. It takes 
a special amount of arrogance 
on the part of a whole program 
to believe nobody in your class 
has earned an A. By requiring 
language courses, for students 
who wish to continue their 
study of French they started 
in high school, the University 
has essentially required me to 
get something less than an A.

I 
am 
a 
high-achieving 

student 
with 
big 
dreams. 

Just the other day, I sat in 
my academic adviser’s room 
discussing my law school plans 
where every 100th decimal 
place 
of 
my 
grade 
point 

average matters. I have found 
this University to be more 
than fair to me in almost every 
respect, except for the French 
program in the Department 
of Romance Languages and 
Literatures. 
That 
program 

stresses me out, causes me to 
panic and makes me honestly 
furious. I am generally a 
content 
person, 
but 
when 

someone needlessly messes 
with my future, I am inclined 
to speak out. So, this is me 
saying something: Stop being 
the reason for my stress, and 
make it fun to learn a language 
again. Finally, to students 
choosing which language they 
want to learn here, I strongly 
advise you to stay away from 
French until real changes are 
made. Though the language 
is 
beautiful, 
the 
program 

couldn’t be more ugly.

 Pending doom of the newspaper industry?

G

rowing up, my family 
had a lot of different 
animals, but perhaps 

one 
of 
the 
most 

memorable to me 
was the big ram 
we called Evander. 
Evander 
was 
a 

mean old ram and 
wouldn’t 
hesitate 

to let you know it. 
My brothers and I 
were 
terrified 
of 

Evander, as we had 
all been run down 
on more than one 
occasion. When we were 
feeling 
especially 
brave, 

we would play a game of 
chicken with him, but these 
games almost always started 
with a dare (who can back 
down from a double dog 
dare?) and ended with one of 
us in tears and an unhealthy 
amount of bruising. While 
we liked to think of it as a 
game, it didn’t do much to 
change the fact that we were 
still scared to death of him.

One day, all the sheep 

had managed to get loose, 
probably by some negligence 
involving the chain keeping 
the gate in place (hey, don’t 
look at me, I wasn’t the last 
one to lock them up). They had 
meandered down into one of 
the neighbor’s fields and after 
several hours we had rounded 
up all of them but Evander, so 
we split up and had a search 
party for him. After a couple 
hours, I stumbled into a field 
a couple miles from home and 
sitting at the edge of the field 
was my brother, lying on top 
of a sheep. As I approached, 
I could see he was covered in 
sweat and breathing pretty 
heavily — both he and the 

sheep were. I will never forget 
the look of pride he had, 
and when I asked why he 

sat there instead 
of bringing the 
sheep home, he 
simply replied: “I 
wanted to savor 
this moment.”

Upon 
being 

found, 
Evander 

had 
apparently 

charged 
my 

brother (didn’t see 
that one coming), 
and 
having 
few 

other choices, my brother was 
forced to fight back. After 
what was recounted as an 
epic battle, my brother had 
managed to down the big guy 
and then lay on top of him 
to keep him down. Or maybe 
it was to teach him a lesson. 
The story depended on if my 
mom was listening or not and 
definitely had nothing to do 
with the fact that she might 
have loved those sheep more 
than she loved us. After the 
incident, Evander’s pride was 
so hurt he never bothered my 
brother again. Shortly after, I 
too downed Evander in order 
to partake in the benefit of not 
getting run down anymore. 
This was my first experience 
that I can remember stepping 
out of my comfort zone and 
ultimately becoming a better 
person for it.

Flash forward to when 

I was accepted to attend 
the University of Michigan, 
and I found myself feeling 
a very familiar fear. I was 
terrified of going so far from 
the place I called home and 
leaving behind everyone and 
everything I knew. When it 
came down to making the final 

college decision, I liked to tell 
people it was a money matter. 
With the scholarship help from 
the University, it simply made 
sense. Deep down, I knew 
it had a lot more to do with 
facing my fears and forcing 
myself to dive headfirst into 
something about which I knew 
very little. This allowed me to 
take a huge step outside of my 
comfort zone.

I remember thinking about 

the story of Evander whenever 
I 
began 
to 
doubt 
myself, 

thinking about the pride and 
feeling of accomplishment I 
saw in my brother and later 
experienced myself. As a first-
generation student, I have had 
to step out of my comfort zone 
time and time again. Many 
times I have found myself in a 
very unfamiliar situation and 
each time I take that extra 
step, I become a slightly better 
person for it.

As 
evolving 
students, 

we must always try to push 
ourselves. We need to face 
our fears, try new things 
and step outside that comfy 
circle we often find ourselves 
becoming complacent in — and 
not just when it’s convenient 
for us, but whenever we have 
the 
opportunity. 
Without 

challenge, there will be no 
growth, and without growth, 
how can we possibly expect 
to create and contribute to 
the change and progress we 
wish to see? Because I faced 
my fears and stepped outside 
my comfort zone, I was able to 
achieve a new sense of pride I 
wouldn’t change for the world. 
A Wolverine pride.

On Wed., March 14, Maize 
Collective — in partnership 
with Universal Music Group 
and Innovate Blue — hosted the 
first of a series of three music 
business panels titled “Industry 
Insight: Songwriters, Producers 
and Studio Musicians.” Held 
at the University of Michigan 
Museum of Art’s auditorium, 
the panel provided aspiring 
Ann Arbor artists with tips for 
success in the music business 
and 
featured 
an 
array 
of 
musicians, including Yungblud, 
a new signee to Geffen Records 
and rising hip-hop star, Evan 
Haywood, 
a 
musician 
and 
multimedia 
artist 
based 
in 
Ann Arbor, Kasan Belgrave, 
a 
Jazz 
Studies 
sophomore 
concentrating in clarinet and 
alto sax and DeNero Montez, 
a Detroit native singer and 
songwriter who has written for 
Justin Bieber.
The panel, moderated by 
Veniece Session of Ann Arbor’s 
Neutral 
Zone, 
addressed 
songwriting 
techniques, 
royalties, musical influences 
and the overall daily life of a 
career musician. Yungblud, who 
performed a few hours later at 
the Majestic Theatre in Detroit, 
was given the most immediate 
attention before leaving early 
for his show. His charismatic 
persona and unfiltered stream 
of consciousness was enticing, 
providing an example to the 
many aspiring musicians in 
the crowd of a young and fresh 

musician 
who 
successfully 
“made 
it” 
in 
the 
music 
business while maintaining his 
rambunctious attitude. When 
asked by Session — who herself 
has experience working with 
independent artists — if signing 
to a major label has hindered 
his creative process, Yungblud 
replied, “To be honest, I figured 

out who I was before I got 
signed. And, if you know that 
and you deep down know who 
you are, then how are they going 
to change that? They signed you 
for a reason, because they like 
you and like your sound.”
Next, Session asked Montez 
to elaborate on the songwriting 
process. He offered an easy-
to-comprehend explanation of 
songwriting and the business 
of 
copyright, 
stressing 
the 
importance of submitting your 

work to BMI (Broadcast Music, 
Inc.) 
or 
ASCAP 
(American 
Society of Composers, Authors 
and Publishers) as well as 
registering your lyrics with the 
Library of Congress. Haywood 
also interjected, advising the 
crowd to always run paperwork 
by a lawyer before signing, 
avoiding any chance that you 
as a songwriter would lose the 
rights to your masters.
Later, after Yungblud left for 
his show and the panel grew 
more intimate, the floor opened 
for audience questions and the 
panel was asked to speak on 
how they remain original in 
their music while having artists 
they admire. Belgrave raised a 
point that was met with nods 
of agreement from both the 
panelists and the audience, 
saying, “Automatically, we 
are 
subject 
to 
music 
that 
comes before us so we are 
automatically paying homage 
to music before us. Music is 
always moving, always evolving 
so I think you have to hear 
things from the past to create 
new sounds.”
The 
panel 
closed 
with 
Haywood 
offering 
young 
musicians a word of advice: 
“Keep 
making 
music, 
keep 
putting it out in any way,” he 
said. “No one will hear it at 
first and eventually you’ll start 
getting traction and building a 
fan base. Those fans will stick 
with you if you’re a nice person. 
Be kind and open and caring. 
Support your friends and make 
a community. Then, when you 
get that success, you will have 
friends holding you up.”

“Tomb Raider” may very 
well be the greatest video 
game movie ever made. Of 
course, I say this as someone 
who believes that there has 
never, in the history of the 
medium, been a good video 
game movie and as someone 
who is about to give the film 
at 
hand 
a 
predominantly 
negative review. But the basic 
competency on display here 
places “Tomb Raider” head 
and shoulders above dreck like 
“Assassin’s Creed,” “Warcraft” 
or “Resident Evil: The Final 
Chapter.” Only rarely could 
such baseline mediocrity be 
something to be celebrated, 
but that’s the state of the video 
game movie genre.
“Tomb Raider” takes most 
of its inspiration from the 2013 
reboot of the popular series, 
following 
adventurer 
Lara 
Croft (Alicia Vikander, “Tulip 
Fever”) as she goes on a search 
for her father years after his 
disappearance. 
After 
being 
shipwrecked on a mysterious 
island, she becomes a prisoner 
of 
Mathias 
Vogel 
(Walton 
Goggins, “Vice Principals”) 
and must fight to finish what 
her father started: Sealing a 
tomb that, if opened, could 
bring about the end of the 
world.
Most of the watchability of 
“Tomb Raider” comes down 
to Vikander’s performance in 
the titular role. From the first 
scene, she brings to life the 

independence 
and 
strength 
of the character with relative 
ease, and her dedication to 
performing many of her own 
stunts pays off during the 
action scenes. While the script 
gives her increasingly little 
to do as the film wears on — 
by the third act, she’s been 
reduced mainly to grunting 

and screaming — she still 
anchors much of the movie 
around her, even as it commits 
the cardinal sin of wasting 
Walton Goggins as a one-note 
villain.
It’s 
in 
the 
storytelling 
department 
where 
you’ll 
find most of “Tomb Raider”’s 
shortcomings. 
At 
different 
points, 
it 
plays 
like 
a 
combination of “Indiana Jones 
and the Last Crusade” and “The 
Lost World: Jurassic Park,” 
and while that may sound fun 
at first, Roar Uthaug (“The 
Wave”) is no Steven Spielberg; 
his film lacks the sense of 
wonder and discovery that 
both of those films brought 
to bear at their best. There’s 
some fun to the treasure hunt, 
but many scenes feel like a 
non-interactive video game, 
denying 
the 
audience 
the 
opportunity to feel like they’re 
solving the puzzles along with 

Lara. That’s most of the fun 
of any movie like this, and it’s 
completely missing here.
For all Vikander’s talents 
as a physical performer, the 
action falls prey to Uthaug’s 
mishandled direction, as well. 
They aren’t potential health 
hazards like the action of a 
“Resident Evil” movie, but 
the fights in “Tomb Raider” 
are 
still 
wildly 
overcut 
and 
incomprehensible. 
It’s 
impossible to have any sort 
of 
appreciation 
for 
what 
Vikander is pulling off when 
you can’t tell what on Earth 
she’s doing in the first place. 
Even when the editing slows 
down, scenes like an extended 
bike chase through London 
or a foot chase through the 
docks add nothing to the 
story and instead simply pad 
the runtime. Again, this sort 
of thing might be fun with 
a controller in your hands 
— your average video game 
campaign runs about 10 to 20 
hours and thrives on smaller 
scale action like this — but in 
a movie, it’s just a distraction 
from the plot.
Uthaug’s fumbled direction 
is 
ultimately 
what 
dooms 
“Tomb Raider” to the purgatory 
between good and bad. There’s 
nothing 
to 
outright 
hate 
here, but there’s also little 
that’s memorable. Given that 
most video game movies are 
memorable only for their awe-
inspiring lack of quality and 
apathetic performances and 
writing, “Tomb Raider,” in all 
its normality, may represent a 
small step forward.

‘Tomb Raider’ is a shining

EVENT REVIEW

SETH ALLEN / MAIZE COLLECTIVE

Is it really a dog-movie 
if it fails to make us cry? 
Throughout 
the 
years, 
cinematic portrayals of the 
unbreakable bonds between 
humans and dogs have, without 
fail, included a moment or 
two — if not an entire plotline 
— dedicated to tugging at 
audiences’ 
heartstrings. 
“Benji” is no exception. The 

most 
recent 
of 
numerous 
adaptations of the original 1974 
picture, this 2018 remake is 
proof of the perception that the 
storyline of a loyal dog and an 
endangered human companion 
is 
timeless. 
Though 
the 
instances of innocent cuteness 
in “Benji” will illicit more than 
a few “aww” reactions from 
viewers, 
the 
unexceptional 
characters 
and 
predictable 
plotline make everything else 
in the film come off rather dull.
Consistent 
with 
its 

predecessors, 
the 
storyline 
that “Benji” adheres to is 
fairly simple. Two spirited 
and 
independent 
middle-
school-aged siblings, Carter 
(Gabriel 
Bateman, 
“Lights 
Out”) 
and 
Frankie 
(Darby 
Camp, “Big Little Lies”), find a 
stray dog on the New Orleans 
city streets, forming a special 
bond with their newfound 
friend and naming him Benji. 
Matters 
escalate 
quickly, 
however,

‘Benji’ will make you cry

SAMANTHA NELSON
Daily Arts Writer

visiting a local pawn shop, a 
place they frequent in hopes 
of 
purchasing 
back 
their 
deceased father’s old watch. 
Carter 
and 
Frankie 
find 
themselves victim to a robber’s 
stupidity, which transforms 
a plain, economically-driven 
act of theft into a full-blown 
kidnapping. One of the only 
witnesses 
to 
the 
incident, 
despite his being a dog and 
an inferior to the — ironically 
— consistently clueless adults 
around him, Benji must lead 
the mission to save Carter and 
Frankie and prove his loyalty 
and devotion. 
The shining moments that 
emerge from “Benji” are not 
those that add to the forward 
momentum of the plot, which 
becomes 
quite 
foreseeable 
within the first 30 minutes of 
the film. Given the repeated 
remakes that this storyline has 
undergone, without significant 
adjustment to plot, character 
or tone, it can be surmised 
that director Brandon Camp’s 
intentions are not to shock 
audiences or push boundaries. 
Instead, “Benji” finds another 
way to grab viewers’ attention 
by evoking pity on Benji’s 
behalf. 
The 
interspersing 
of sequences that show an 
unwanted Benji trotting along 
with sad eyes and a hunched 
back are especially effective 
in puncturing even the coldest 
of hearts, warming any viewer 

up to the canine protagonist 
and giving viewers a reason 
to connect with the events 
unfolding on the screen before 
them.
In the opening sequence, 
audience members observe in 
distress as Benji’s mother and 
littermates are discovered by 
a dog-catcher, locked up and 
taken to the pound, leaving 
puppy-Benji helpless and alone. 

Stunned with pity for Benji, it 
becomes virtually impossible 
for viewers not to emotionally 
gravitate towards and invest 
in the poor, lonesome puppy 
before their eyes. Thus, even 
once the main, uninventive 
plotline of the film kicks in, 
audiences 
find 
themselves 
rooting for the rescue of the 
detained children, not out of 
complete, 
genuine 
concern 
for Carter and Frankie’s fate, 
but rather out of a desire for 
Benji to finally find the home 
and the love that he has been 
searching for. 
Empathy felt for Benji’s 
pure intentions of finding a 
family aside, viewers cannot 
help but impatiently await the 
arrival of the end of the film, 
an end that from the start, was 

far too obviously set-up to be a 
happy one. Though audiences 
are blatantly aware of where 
the children are and how to 
find them, “Benji” proceeds 
to include segments in which 
the authorities take stabs at 
detective work, attempting to 
solve a mystery that audiences 
already know the answer to 
for what feels like a painfully 
boring 
and 
frustrating 
eternity.
What 
is 
fundamentally 
problematic 
with 
“Benji” 
is that, though it is able to 
evoke temporary emotional 
responses 
from 
audience 
members, that is all it is able 
to do. The mixture of pity 
and hope that moviegoers 
experience 
simply 
is 
not 
enough to sustain attention-
spans for the duration of the 
film. 
Unlike 
contemporary 
dog-movie genre flicks such 
as, “Marley and Me,” “Hatchi” 
and even “A Dog’s Purpose,” 
“Benji” is not a film that can 
be 
thoroughly 
enjoyed 
by 
everyone. 
Though 
younger 
audience members will almost 
certainly find entertainment 
through this family-friendly 
adventure, 
no 
amount 
of 
commiseration or desire for 
redemption for “Benji” can 
induce any viewer beyond 
the age of 10 to ignore the 
tedious nature and severe lack 
of imagination that “Benji” 
possesses.

BOOK REVIEW

I have a theory that all 
good books fall into one of two 
categories. Some are good like 
Oreos or Amanda Bynes movies: 
They probably won’t win a Pulitzer 
Prize anytime soon, but they’re 
compelling and comforting and 
impossible to put down. Others 
are good like quinoa and Oscar-
winning 
documentaries: 
They 
might be a little bit less accessible, 
but they offer something real and 
sustaining, and they change the 
way you move through the world. 
And then there are the rare, best 
books that can do both, making you 
a better person in painless, wildly 
entertaining ways. That’s Marisa 
de los Santos’s gift. Her books are 
consummate page-turners, imbued 
with all the mystery twists and 
will-they-or-won’t-they 
tension 
of a beach read, but they’re also 
beautifully crafted, deeply felt and 
consistently life-affirming. While 
de los Santos’s latest novel, “I’ll Be 
Your Blue Sky,” might not shine 
quite as bright as those that came 
before it, it still has that signature 
cocktail of wit and wonder that 
makes de los Santos great.
“I’ll Be Your Blue Sky” revisits 
the characters of de los Santos’s 
earlier novels, “Love Walked In” 
and “Belong to Me,” a few years 
down the road. Clare Hobbes is 
all grown up and about to marry 
Zach, a man who is, “So generally, 
generically marriageable it was 
almost funny.” Zach is smart, 
handsome and determined to be a 
good person despite his troubled 

past, but Clare can’t shake the 
feeling that their relationship 
isn’t quite right. On her wedding 
day, she serendipitously meets 
Edith Herron, an old woman who 
gives her the courage to follow 
her instincts and break off the 
engagement. Weeks later, Clare 
discovers that Edith has died and 
left her a New England beach 
house, a safe haven where Clare 

can pick up the pieces of her broken 
heart. But everything at Blue Sky 
House isn’t what it seems, and 
Clare and her childhood friend 
Dev set out on an adventure to 
unveil the mysteries of Edith’s past.
It would be easy to pigeonhole 
this book into the ill-defined and 
commonly maligned category of 
“women’s fiction,” where so many 
good stories go to die. Ignoring for 
the moment the larger problem 
of how our society values content 
aimed at women, “I’ll Be Your 
Blue Sky” does conform to some of 
the clichés of the genre. It’s clear, 
within the first few chapters, who 
Clare will end up with (which 
points to another cliché — the 
idea that the heroine has to end 
up with anyone at all). The female 

relationships 
are 
lovely 
and 
supportive and aspirational, but 
they struggle to pass the Bechdel 
test. The story is interested in love 
— its complexities and paradoxes 
and purities — more than anything 
else, at the expense of hard-hitting 
social criticism or intellectual 
theorizing.
But 
within 
that 
“women’s 
fiction” framework, de los Santos 
works magic. She’s a sharp observer 
of the details, “All the small, 
scattered pieces of the precious 
and luminous ordinary,” and as a 
result her world and its characters 
buzz with life and authenticity. If 
the relationship-centric subject 
matter seems cliché, it’s executed 
with such clear-eyed sensitivity 
as to be completely irresistible, 
even to a card-carrying cynic. 
De los Santos writes fiction like a 
poet, every word lovingly chosen, 
and in her capable hands even the 
simplest things sparkle.
Rather than “women’s fiction,” 
it might be more accurate to 
categorize this book as magical 
realism. The parameters of Clare 
and Edith’s world are certainly 
different than our own: No mystery 
is unsolvable, no coincidence is 
impossible and happy endings 
are guaranteed. But does it really 
matter if this fantasy world she 
creates, where the people are all 
a degree better than we know 
ourselves to be, isn’t as realistic as 
realistic fiction would like? It’s still 
delightful, clever and emotionally 
resonant in a way that continues to 
echo long after the final page. I’ve 
had enough of reality. Bring me 
more magic, please.

‘I’ll Be Your Blue Sky’ is a 
magical, resonant read

If the weeks in the wake 
of 
Parkland 
have 
taught 
us anything, it’s that high 
schoolers are a lot sharper, 
a lot cooler and a lot tougher 
than they’re given credit for. 
That’s probably not news to 
Netflix, which has quickly put 
together an impressive arsenal 
of 
original 
programming 
featuring 
young 
characters 
— from smash hits “Stranger 
Things” and “13 Reasons Why” 
to sleeper favorites “Everything 
Sucks!” and “American Vandal.”
“On My Block,” a new half-
hour 
comedy-drama 
from 
“Awkward” 
creator 
Lauren 
Iungerich, 
is 
a 
welcome 
addition to the lineup. It’s a 
sharp, moving series set in 
South Central Los Angeles 
and centered around children 
of color, who — though pop 
culture might lead you to 
believe otherwise — actually 
come of age, too.
The 
show 
follows 
four 
lifelong best friends as they 
navigate their freshman year of 
high school. There’s headstrong 
tomboy 
Monse 
(newcomer 
Sierra 
Capri), 
high-strung 
Jamal (Brett Gray, “Rise”), 
suave Ruby (Jason Genao, “The 
Get Down”) and sensitive Cesar 
(Diego Tinoco, “Teen Wolf”). 
The quartet is joined later by 

Olivia (Ronni Hawk, “Stuck 
in the Middle”), who moves in 
with Ruby’s family when her 
parents are deported.
There are story beats that feel 
familiar — drama surrounding 
the school dance, complicated 
love triangles, the pressure of 
family expectations. But there 
are also plenty of elements we 

don’t often see on television 
that keep the show original 
and fresh. Cesar struggles to 
break away from the gang life 
men in his family are forced 
into; Olivia is crushed that her 
parents won’t be around for her 
quinceañera.
It all makes for a show that’s 
tonally interesting. Storylines 
that are full of laughs, like 
Jamal’s madcap quest for buried 
treasure stolen from a roller 
rink, find themselves alongside 
much heavier arcs, like Monse’s 
search for her biological mother. 
Fortunately, for the most part, 
the show’s young stars have the 
acting chops to pull it off.
It’s largely thanks to them 
that “On My Block” manages 
that emotional whiplash quite 
well. The constant teetering 
between comedy and drama 
gives rise to some exposition-
heavy 
writing 
and 
stiff 
performances at first, but the 

show’s ambitions pay off by 
the season’s final episodes, 
when everything really falls 
into place. And the initially 
disparate 
narrative 
strands 
converge and crescendo in a 
genuinely shocking finale that 
begs for a second season.
The show’s real strength 
lies in its characters, who feel 
immediately real and lived-in, 
as if they’re old friends we’ve 
known our whole lives. It makes 
every triumph they experience 
a little sweeter and every 
disappointment 
a 
bit 
more 
heartbreaking. Monse, Jamal, 
Ruby, Cesar and Olivia aren’t 
the types of characters whose 
stories usually get told on 
television, but they’re each so 
compelling that it’s impossible 
not to fall in love with them. And 
though the show doesn’t make 
any mention of politics, there’s 
something 
about 
watching 
teenagers of color take up space 
and speak their mind that feels 
almost revolutionary.
It’s no surprise that some of 
the most affecting, enjoyable 
works on screen in the past 
year — from “Lady Bird” to 
“Dear White People” to “Love, 
Simon” — have been modern 
portraits of young adulthood 
in all of its joy and confusion 
and awakening. “On My Block” 
brings more needed diversity 
to the coming-of-age canon, 
and does so with a charm 
and charisma that’s simply 
irresistible.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

Last Thursday, folk fans from 
Ann Arbor and beyond gathered 
at The Ark and settled into the 
seats closely surrounding the 
stage. The scene was a familiar 
one for anyone who has spent 
time at The Ark in the past: People 
chat with each other and sit down 
with drinks and popcorn, the 
lights go dim. It’s a special kind of 
atmosphere, whether or not you’re 
very familiar with the artist of 
the night, because it’s easy to feel 
the community for the evening 
already beginning to take hold.
That night, the performance in 
question was that of Langhorne 
Slim, with an opening set by 
Christian Lee Hutson. And while 
the usual feelings of an Ark 
folk show were all there — the 
community, the emotion and the 
attentiveness — these particular 
artists seemed to extend their 
talents into other modes of 
entertainment 
as 
well. 
Both 
performances were punctuated 
by 
storytelling 
and 
comedy 
that had almost everyone in the 
audience cracking up at one point 
or another.
Hutson took the stage first, 
wearing a bright, retro orange 
shirt indicative of his Los Angeles 
origins. 
Hutson 
warmed 
up 
the crowd with a wide variety 
of songs from his repertoire, 
ricocheting easily and naturally 
between 
moody 
love 
songs, 
folksy reflections and alt rock 
irony. One of the highlights was, 
unquestionably, the humorous 
post-breakup song, “The Kid,” 
with a refrain that just about made 
everyone present laugh: “It doesn’t 
matter what you did / I think 
that we should have a kid.” The 
charismatic carelessness of this 
song was perfectly reflective of 
Hutson’s persona between songs: 
Candid and vulnerable, good-
natured and shameless. There 
were also moments that dug a 
little deeper, like his performance 
of “I Just Can’t Fucking Do It 
Anymore,” a toned-down ode 
to the bittersweet nature of 

resignation and closure.
Slim took the stage next, with 
a range of songs just as eclectic. 
What’s more, each new song 
seemed to hint at a new facet of 
Slim’s personality; even after 
the entire concert was over and 
people were starting to file out, 
it was difficult to know what to 
make of him, how to sort all of the 
different scraps and fragments 
he’d shown us into a picture that 
felt complete.
One thing that can definitely 
be said about Slim is that he was 
social. Like Hutson, he was able to 
command the entire venue easily, 
despite having no band behind 
him. He was just a single man 
with a guitar, yet it didn’t take long 
before the audience was hanging 
on to his every word and chord. 
He even brought it up at one point, 
remarking, “This is a listening 
room.” He praised the audience 
for listening so respectfully, but 
also encouraged everyone not to 
feel suppressed, to know they were 
more than welcome to sing along 
if they knew the words. People 
laughed at this; undoubtedly 
nobody had realized they were 
being so quiet — we’d been so 
hooked on the performance that 
we didn’t notice.
And people did sing along; 
the 
soft 
voices 
of 
audience 
members filled the room during 
the hits “Changes” and “Life is 
Confusing,” and rose in volume 
for more exuberant numbers like 
“Wild Soul.” But they also fell back 
into pools of captivated silence 
during some of the broken-up 
periods between songs, when Slim 
would tell lengthy, varied stories 
about his life and experiences, 
interspersed with jokes. He joked 
about Graham Nash, who had 
performed at The Ark recently 
and left his setlist behind; Slim 
would often consult the setlist (on 
the back of which he’d written his 
own) and wonder aloud how his 
performance was likely living up 
to Nash’s.
He also told the room about 
his childhood summers in Ocean 
City and the love he had for his 
grandparents. 
He 
then 
sang 
“Ocean City (For May, Jack 
& Brother John),” a short but 

poignant song about growing up 
that resonated so much more due 
to the context. Above all else, he 
had an astounding capacity to 
switch abruptly from one mode 
to the next. One minute, he would 
be giving a moving performance 
or telling a story about his 
grandparents that could make 
half the people in the room tear 
up, and the next he would swivel 
into a cheerful, exciting new song, 
and pull the audience right along 
with him.
Each second was just as soul-
baring as the one that came before 
it, with honest, poetic lyrics that 
made it feel as though we were 
almost having a conversation with 
Slim, rather than simply being 
entertained by him. Lines like, “If 
I had somebody to love me / Then 
I’d have somebody to love,” from 
“Funny Feelin’,” were so playful, 
poetic and relatable that it was 
impossible not to be immersed in 
the moment.
All of this reached its peak at 
the very end of the concert. For 
his encore, Slim had The Ark turn 
the lights on. We’d been engulfed 
in pitch-darkness for the entire 
performance, and it felt a little 
jarring to suddenly see each other 
in all the light. Then he did the 
encore while walking around the 
aisles between the rows, making 
eye contact with everybody and 
nodding and singing, high-fiving 
people and grasping their hands. 
Artists do sometimes walk around 
with the crowd while performing, 
but for him to do it with all of 
the lights on — everyone able to 
clearly see each other as if it were 
daytime — felt much more bizarre, 
unique and oddly touching.
From what he showed us 
that night, Langhorne Slim is a 
musician, as well as a storyteller 
and a comedian. He has a great 
love for the people around him, 
singular thoughts and (more 
importantly) 
the 
ability 
to 
articulate them, and an awed, 
specific memory. It is difficult to 
understand him fully based on 
these pieces, but we don’t need to; 
maybe it is enough, as an audience, 
to value what he has given us, and 
to hope that we have given him 
something back.

Season, careers come to an end for Wolverines

Like father, like son, the old 

cliché goes.

And this was never more true 

for Michigan wrestling coach 
Joe McFarland than it was 
Saturday night.

The Wolverines capped a 

wildly successful regular season 
Saturday night in Cleveland, 
finishing 
tied 

for fourth place 
at 
the 
NCAA 

Wrestling 
Championships 
with 
80 
team 

points.

Although 

the 
team 

failed 
to 
take 

home any first 
place 
finishes, 

Michigan placed 
five 
wrestlers 

on the podium, all of whom 
garnered All-American honors. 
Among them were redshirt 
sophomore 
133-lb 
Stevan 

Micic and fifth-year senior 
heavyweight 
Adam 
Coon, 

each the runner-up at their 

respective weight class.

But 
for 
McFarland, 
the 

magnitude of the night went 
far beyond the team’s success. 
For McFarland — who retired 
following the championships 
— the story began in Cleveland, 
many years ago.

Joe 
McFarland 
Sr., 

McFarland’s father, settled in 
Cleveland 
following 
service 

in World War II. He retired 

there following 
33 years as a 
firefighter.

Saturday, 

his 
son, 
Joe 

McFarland 
Jr., retired in 
Cleveland — the 
city where he 
was raised — 
after 33 years 
as a wrestling 
coach 
in 
a 

pseudo-tribute 

to his father.

While 
recounting 
the 

similarities, McFarland could 
not help but get nostalgic, and 
said the parallels to his father’s 
career made the moment all the 
more special.

Also special — as he has been 

all season — was Coon, who 
steamrolled his way through 
the preliminary rounds before 
falling to Olympic gold medalist 
Kyle Snyder of Ohio State in the 
championship round.

In the wake of McFarland’s 

retirement, Coon sang praises 
of his coach and mentor.

“Coach 
McFarland 
has 

definitely given me lots of 
opportunities,” 
Coon 
said. 

“He 
gave 

me 
the 
great 

opportunity 
to 

wrestle 
here 

at 
Michigan, 

so I’m forever 
grateful for that 
and this great 
opportunity he 
gave me. And I 
just 
appreciate 

everything he’s 
done 
for 
the 

program, as well as helping me 
grow as an athlete.”

For Coon, the night was 

nostalgic, 
too. 
Following 

his 
dual’s 
completion, 
the 

curtain closed on his Michigan 
wrestling career. But despite 

his impressive collection of 
accolades, Coon, rightfully so, 
wanted to be known as more 
than simply a great wrestler.

“What I’ll be known for 

I hope is for my work ethic 
and just what I brought to the 
team in being a leader and just 
working hard every day to give 
everything I had,” Coon said. 
“I hope I’ll be remembered 
as a good person and a man of 
faith, and that’s all I can hope 

for, that people 
will 
remember 

my 
personality 

and what it was 
like rather than 
all the accolades 
and stuff like 
that.” 

McFarland 

recognizes 
Coon’s 
importance, too. 
Back in October, 

when his star heavyweight was 
just returning to form following 
a 
year 
off 
due 
to 
injury, 

McFarland complimented Coon 
by saying “he leads by example 
more than anything.” 

In addition to leading by 

example, 
Coon’s 
personality 

was a huge factor in the team’s 
growth throughout the season, 
and enabled the team to mesh as 
a collective unit.

“This was a different team 

because it was such a close-knit 
bond between everybody on 
the team,” Coon said. “It was 
great to see how everyone grew 
with their technique and their 
work ethic in the practice room. 
Individually everybody knew 
how to step up their game to get 
more out of practice and out of 
competitions than I’ve seen in 
all these guys’ recent past so it 
was great to see everybody pick 
it up one more level.”

It speaks volumes to Coon 

as a leader that he is more 
concerned with his legacy off 
the mat than on it. Then again, 
Coon is just following the 
example set by his legendary, 
and now retired, coach.

‘M’ beats in-state rival 
to start Big Ten season

The No. 8 Michigan men’s 

tennis team (11-2 overall, 1-0 
Big Ten) got to four points so 
quickly against Michigan State 
(6-9, 0-1) that the coaches let the 
Wolverines play out the rest of 
the matches on court, resulting 
in a 7-0 senior-led sweep of the 
Spartans.

Riding a seven-match win 

streak into the conference play, 
the Wolverines had the Spartans’ 
number right from the get-go. 
Using their own boisterous chants 
of “GO…BLUE” and suffocating 
doubles play, Michigan won the 
first point in twenty minutes 
with 6-0 wins at No. 1 and No. 3 
doubles.

“I 
think 

third 
doubles 

was a big lift 
for 
us,” 
said 

Michigan head 
coach 
Adam 

Steinberg. 
“They 
got 

off to a great 
start and just 
lit the fire for 
everybody else. 
We needed that.

“We’ve been up-and-down 

(in doubles). We’ve had some 
good moments and some bad 
moments, but we are not going 
to be a great team until we start 
dominating the doubles point. 
That was great to see.”

But the Wolverines were not 

done, as senior Carter Lin used 
the energy of the home crowd to 
propel himself to a 6-1, 6-2 win at 
No. 4 singles.

“Carter Lin has been fantastic 

this year,” said senior Alex 
Knight. “We always go into a 
match thinking we are already 
up because he does such a great 
job. He battles super hard and 
he’s a great team guy. We look to 
him to lead on the singles court 

and he always does that.”

With 
Michigan 
up 
2-0, 

Knight was locked in a grueling 
first set at the No. 2 singles spot 
with 
Michigan 
State’s 
Josh 

Mukherjee, squeaking out a 7-5 
win before making adjustments 
and asserting his dominance 
with a 6-0 second set to close out 
the Wolverines’ third point.

“I had so many deuce points 

and I was a little anxious going 
into it. We had a big crowd,” 
Knight said. “Once I realized, 
‘Hey, you’re getting the balls 
you worked for. You’re just 
getting them a lot earlier than 
the players you typically play 
against,’ then it was easy from 
there.”

Senior Davis Crocker followed 

up 
Knight’s 

triumphant effort 
with one of his 
own at No. 5 
singles, winning 
the fourth point 
and 
sealing 

the win for the 
Wolverines 
6-2, 

6-3.

However, 
the 

most 
special 

moment of the day 

occurred when senior Runhao 
Hua — who normally competes 
at No. 2 singles — cranked out a 
gutsy three-setter, 3-6, 6-3, 10-8, 
at the No. 1 position to start off 
his final season.

“(Hua) has had a great year. 

He’s on a big winning streak. I 
felt like he’s a senior. Let’s give 
him a chance to play one before 
he graduates,” said Steinberg. 
“He’s earned it. He’s been 
playing unbelievable, so we felt 
like this is a time we can make a 
change and give him a chance. I 
think he’s deserving of it.”

Michigan 
isn’t 
getting 

complacent as there is a long 
Big Ten season ahead. But the 
Wolverines 
will 
enjoy 
this 

rivalry win for now.

Michigan sweeps Iowa, Nebraska

Michigan can breathe a sigh of 

relief.

After weeks of struggling on 

the court, the women’s tennis 
team snapped a five-match losing 
streak to start its Big Ten season 
with two straight wins.

“We’ve talked all week that 

really our season is starting 
again,” said Michigan coach 
Ronni Bernstein. “We’re just 
going to take it one match at a 
time and see what we can do, 
there’s still a lot to play for.”

The Wolverines were on the 

road against Iowa and Nebraska, 
winning 6-1 and 4-3, respectively.

Friday evening saw Michigan 

(2-0 Big Ten, 5-8 overall) revert 
back to typical form. It clinched 
the doubles point easily with 
No. 1 and No. 3 doubles earning 
victories and dropping just four 
games between them.

Braced with the 1-0 advantage, 

sophomore 
Brienne 
Minor 

took the court for her singles 
match and defeated Hawkeye 
Zoe Douglas — earning her first 
singles win at No. 3 since her 
NCAA Championship victory and 
subsequent knee surgery. While 
she has been back to full health 
for some time, her confidence 
was lacking. This may have been 
the breakthrough she needed, 
a sentiment the rest of the 

Wolverines can understand.

“The thing we talked about 

is just forgetting what’s in the 
past,” Bernstein said. “We can’t 
go back to any of those matches. I 
think the biggest thing was to just 
change our presence.

“When things are difficult, 

what 
are 
we 

gonna do — be 
tough and fight 
through 
it 
or 

are we gonna go 
away.”

With the Iowa 

victory under its 
belt, 
Michigan 

took its newfound 
toughness 
and 

put it to the test 
against a strong 
Nebraska (13-3, 2-1) squad.

At 
first, 
it 
appeared 
the 

Wolverines were lost once again. 
Senior Mira Ruder-Hook was 
locked into a cross court rally, 
but in her attempt to keep the ball 
away from the net player Ruder-
Hook’s inside-out forehand sailed 
wide. Michigan had dropped the 
doubles point.

While not ideal, it wasn’t the 

nail in the coffin. But then the 
first singles match to finish was 
a 6-0, 6-2 loss from Ruder-Hook. 
The Wolverines were in a 2-0 
hole.

But their confidence didn’t 

waver. The next four Michigan 
players were victorious, with 

junior Kate Fahey securing the 
team win. Fahey’s consistency 
was the guiding light through 
the Wolverines’ rough patch, but 
Sunday, she didn’t have to carry 
the team alone.

“It’s unbelievable at the top 

spot to know that Kate is going to 

come 
through,” 

Bernstein 
said. 

“But I think the 
biggest thing is all 
the pressure can’t 
be on her all the 
time. We needed 
other people to 
step up. … That’s 
going to help us 
play looser and 
freer and that’s 
how we’re going 

to get better as a team.”

With the rest of the team 

catching up to Fahey, the team 
chemistry may just be starting 
to 
click 
for 
Michigan. 
The 

Wolverines 
have 
chosen 
the 

perfect time to get their season 
back on track, and the hopes of 
winning the Big Ten no longer 
seem so far-fetched.

Maybe 
Michigan’s 
season 

really is just beginning.

Robinson takes on mentorship role for blossoming Livers

Duncan Robinson heard the 

whistle and knew just what that 
meant.

He walked off the court with 

2:07 left and the score tied 
against Houston on Saturday 
night — fouling out for just the 
fourth time in his career — 
knowing it could be his last time 
doing so in his Michigan career. 
But Robinson didn’t sulk or let 
the moment get to him.

He had one specific message 

for one specfic person: Isaiah 
Livers.

“Duncan told me when he 

fouled out, ‘Isaiah, there’s a 
reason why we’re both out here, 
why we both play the game,’” 
Livers recalled in the aftermath 
of Michigan’s second-round win 
over the Cougars. “ ‘You have 
talent, so believe in yourself. 
Have all confidence.’ ”

This has become a theme 

between the fifth-year senior 
on his way out the door and 
the freshman just scraping the 
surface of what he can become. 
It’s 
hardly 
an 
uncommon 

phenomenon for a veteran to 
take a younger player under his 
wing, to share words of wisdom 
and help guide what’s to come.

But 
even 
for 
two 
mild-

mannered players, this close-
knit relationship is one bred of 
unusual circumstances. 

Robinson started the season 

the clearcut starter at the ‘4’ 
far more out of necessity than 
fit. He’s vascillated between a 
starter and an offensive bench 
threat 
his 
entire 
Michigan 

career. Never known for his 
defensive 
prowess 
against 

quicker 
and 
more 
athletic 

opponents, the ‘4’ was a peculiar 
fit borne out of positional 
scarcity after D.J. Wilson left 
unexpectedly for the NBA Draft.

“We 
all 
know 
Duncan 

Robinson is a mismatch ‘4,’ that 
we don’t have another answer 
right now, right?” said Michigan 

coach John Beilein after an 
early January game in Iowa. 
“D.J. Wilson was the answer 
this year, and he’s not here.”

So why not Livers?
“I 
mean, 
if 

you 
saw 
some 

of our practices 
(early 
in 
the 

season), 
you 

would 
question 

why we gave him 
a 
scholarship,” 

Beilein said.

But Livers was 

on 
scholarship, 

and 
the 
only 

scholarship 
player with a natural fit at the 
‘4’ at that. If circumstances had 
been different, the freshman 
likely would have seen limited 
minutes, if any at all. Instead, 
his opportunity blossomed into 
real growth quicker than Beilein 

could 
have 
imagined. 
Real 

growth led to real minutes. Real 
minutes led to real production.

In a six-game stretch in 

January, Livers shot 10-of-16 

from 
3-point 

range, averaging 
9.3 
points 
per 

game 
in 
that 

span 
while 

providing 
a 

physical upgrade 
defensively.

This, coupled 

with 
prolonged 

shooting 
struggles 
from 

Robinson, 
soon 

sparked a competition for the 
starting role. It was a team 
captain fighting the demons of 
a disappointing senior season 
up against a freshman starting 
to figure out how he could help 
right away.

Livers was the “stretch-four” 

of the future and the stopgap of 
the present.

On Jan. 13 against Michigan 

State, 
Livers 
offically 
won 

out. 
Beilein 

inserted 
him 

in the starting 
lineup at Breslin 
Center 
in 
an 

83-73 upset win 
over 
Michigan 

State. 
And 
he 

hasn’t left the 
starting 
lineup 

since, aside from 
a minor ankle 
injury that kept 
him out of a January win at 
Wisconsin. 

For Robinson, the benching 

was 
rock-bottom, 
further 

sending 
his 
senior 
season 

spiraling out of control. Until it 
wasn’t.

Since that Wisconsin game, 

Robinson 
has 
re-discovered 

his shot, shooting 49 percent 
from 3-point range and scoring 
in 
double-figures 
in 
seven 

of 
11 
games. 

Despite 
Livers’ 

regular 
role 

in the starting 
lineup, Robinson 
has 
regained 

the bulk of the 
minutes, earning 
more 
playing 

time than Livers 
in 14 consecutive 
games.

But 
through 

it all, the relationship between 
sage veteran and eager youngster 
has only strengthened.

“I always try to be in his 

ear,” 
Robinson, 
increasingly 

introspective by the week, said 
early Sunday morning. “His 

biggest thing is, he doesn’t 
realize how good he is, how 
talented he is. Once he can tap 
into that, his whole career will 
take off. He’s been so good for 
us already, but he’s just getting 
going. He’s got to continue to 
chase it, chase it, like he was 
when he was coming for the 
starting spot that he ultimately 
ended up winning. I’m happy 
that I’ve got a guy, when I foul 
out, that can go in there and 
battle the way he can.”

Added 
Livers 
after 
the 

first round of the Big Ten 
Tournament: “I don’t know 
why, I don’t know what it is, but 
people were just saying, ‘Maybe 
they don’t get along. Maybe they 
do.’ No way. We get along. It’s 
his senior year. I wanna do it 
big for him. … All love. We talk 
all the time, he helps me all the 
time. Just a great leader and a 
great veteran.”

Either could have let the 

competition breed resentment. 
Robinson could have sulked 
after 
being 
benched 
for 
a 

freshman, just as Livers could 
have questioned his decreasing 
role as the season winds to a 
close.

Neither happened, and now 

both are better off for it. 

Which brings us back to 

Saturday night and the moment 
the mentor needed the mentee 
to help prolong his career. 
Livers, throwing the inbound 
dart right on the money to 
senior guard Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman, certainly did 
his part in the miraculous win.

“I didn’t want Duncan to go 

out that way,” Livers said after 
the game. “That’s my guy. Senior 
fouling out like that, I couldn’t 
(let it) go.”

That wasn’t Isaiah Livers’ 

response 
to 
helping 
save 

Robinson’s career or how he felt 
coming into a tight game with 
the season on the line. That was 
Livers’ 
answer, 
unprompted, 

on how it felt to be going to Los 
Angeles.

Fifth-year senior forward Duncan Robinson and freshman forward Isaiah Livers have grown a relationship despite competing for the same position.

“His biggest

doesn’t realize 
how good he is.”

Three keys to Michigan’s first round matchup with Northeastern

On 
Sunday 
afternoon, 
the 

Michigan hockey team celebrated 
an NCAA Tournament bid in year 
one of the Mel Pearson era.

The 
Wolverines 
(20-14-3 

overall), 
the 
third-youngest 

team in college hockey, won just 
13 games a season ago. In mid-
January this year, they were just 
27th in the PairWise rankings. 
Just reaching the dance is a 
monumental accomplishment in 
and of itself.

But if Michigan has learned 

one thing from playing in the Big 
Ten, arguably the nation’s best 
conference, it’s that success — no 
matter how unexpected — that 
only has so many rewards.

With that said, the Wolverines’ 

first-round draw against No. 3 
seed Northeastern (23-9-5) seems 
almost preordained. On paper, 
the Huskies, PairWise’s ninth-
ranked team, are a brutal matchup 
for Michigan. They possess a 
dangerous offense and a staunch 
defense, ranking fifth and sixth 
in the country, respectively. Their 
power play is better than all but 
two teams nationally. And stud 
freshman 
goaltender 
Cayden 

Primeau is the owner of a pristine 
.932 save percentage.

Much of this might sound 

familiar to Wolverine fans. In 
fact, Northeastern is a team 
constructed like the last team they 
played.

Ohio State earned a No. 1 seed 

in the NCAA Tournament with 
an efficient offense, lockdown 
defense 
and 
goaltending 
and 

terrific special teams play — like 
the Huskies. Michigan played the 
Buckeyes five times this season 
and lost all five.

There 
are 
still 
positive 

signs, however. On Mar. 10, the 
Wolverines, riding a seven-game 
winning streak at the time, took 
Ohio State to overtime in the 
Big Ten Tournament semifinal, 
by 
far 
their 
best 
showing 

against the Buckeyes. If that 

performance showed anything, 
it’s that Michigan is peaking at 
the right time. But to take down 
Northeastern, that must continue.

The Daily looks at three things 

the Wolverines must do this 
Saturday to advance to another 
national championship.

Better defense against the 

Big Three

The 
Wolverines 
may 
have 

the ‘DMC’ line — the dynamic 
forward combination of seniors 
Tony Calderone and Dexter Dancs 
and junior Cooper Marody. But 
Northeastern has the Big Three.

Hobey Baker finalists Adam 

Gaudette and Dylan Sikura as well 
as captain Nolan Stevens make 
up the Huskies’ top forward line, 
a lethal combination of speed, 
skill and power — and a possible 
nightmare for an ever-fluctuating 
Michigan defense.

Gaudette, the Hockey East 

Player of the Year and newly-
announced Walter Brown Award 
nominee, led the nation with 30 
goals, 60 points and eight multi-
goal games. The junior also 

notched 11 power play goals, two 
shorthanded tallies and two hat 
tricks.

Not far behind is Sikura, whose 

52 points — 20 goals and 32 assists 
— rank third-best in the country. 
He’s also tied for second in college 
hockey with 5.09 shots on goal per 
game. Stevens rounds out the trio 
with 24 goals and 17 helpers in 37 
games.

Tied 
for 
seventh-worst 

nationally in goals allowed per 
game with 3.35 and ranked 35th in 
team defense, the Wolverines will 
need a stalwart backline to combat 
the Huskies’ offensive juggernaut.

While Pearson was quick to 

point to Northeastern’s top line, 
he stressed the overall importance 
to lock down defensively.

“D-zone coverage, a lot of back 

pressure and tracking, just getting 
ready to play hard without the 
puck,” Pearson said. “We’ll play 
hard with it, we just have to make 
sure we have the mindset that 
we have to play extremely hard 
without the puck.”

More robust scoring

In the first round of the Big 

Ten Tournament, the Wolverines 
swept Wisconsin in a masterful 
showing 
of 
offensive 
output, 

tallying 13 total goals over two 
nights.

Where 
that 
output 
came 

from, however, was different 
both nights. In game one of the 
quarterfinals, Calderone scored 
four times to lead Michigan to a 
6-5 victory.

But the team that took the ice 

the next night looked nothing like 
the team from a night before.

Michigan found twine from 

all over the ice in that fateful 
second matchup, as skaters like 
sophomore defenseman Griffin 
Luce 
made 
it 
past 
Badgers 

goaltender Jack Berry.

From the forwards, freshmen 

Jack Becker and Dakota Raabe 
alongside junior Brendan Warren 
all contributed as well, proving 
that the Wolverines boast an 
eclectic front line.

However, a week later in the Big 

Ten semifinal matchup against 
Ohio State, Marody netted both of 

Michigan’s goals.

While there’s nothing wrong 

with the Wolverines’ two best 
scorers doing what they do best, 
if Michigan wants to make a run 
deep in the NCAA Tournament, 
it will have to exude the versatile 
style of play from the second 
matchup against Wisconsin rather 
than the first.

After all, if Calderone and 

Marody are the only two skaters 
that can produce, powerhouse 
teams 
like 
Northeastern 
and 

Cornell will figure out how to shut 
down two of five.

“Everyone on the roster has to 

work hard” — which stands as the 
perennial sentiment from coaches 
around the country — may just not 
be enough in the Tournament.

Killing penalties and blocking 

shots, which Wolverines such 
as 
Raabe 
and 
Becker 
have 

championed, is just the tip of the 
iceberg.

Everyone needs to produce 

results in the scoring summary if 
Michigan wants to see its name 
slated for the Frozen Four.

Stay out of the box
This 
might 
be 
the 
most 

important key — because it doesn’t 
only apply to Saturday’s game.

Michigan’s penalty kill — in the 

kindest possible language — is a 
mess, and has been all year. The 
Wolverines rank 57th out of 60 
teams in the country when down 
a man. Their timid approach to 
killing penalties has constantly 
left shooters open and sophomore 
goaltender Hayden Lavigne out 
to dry. Even last weekend at Ohio 
State, that showed no signs of 
changing, as the Buckeyes’ two 
goals in regulation came with the 
extra man.

Northeastern’s 
power 
play, 

meanwhile, has scored on 27.2 
percent 
of 
its 
chances 
this 

season. Sikura and Gaudette have 
combined to score 24 goals with the 
man advantage themselves — for 
comparison, the Wolverines have 
scored 26 as a team. The power 
play might be the Huskies’ biggest 
strength, and it feeds straight into 
Michigan’s greatest weakness.

The 
Wolverines 
have 
two 

options here. One is to unleash 
the speed of players such as 
Jake Slaker, Warren and Raabe 
to create havoc and possibly 
even 
shorthanded 
scoring 

opportunities. Michigan caught 
a glimpse of what that might look 
like back in February against 
Wisconsin, where Raabe was a 
one-man wrecking crew, drawing 
two penalties against the Badgers 
in their own zone.

The second option is not to 

commit penalties in the first place. 
In this regard, the Wolverines have 
been fine — ranking 24th in the 
nation in penalty kill attempts per 
game — barring four preventable 
penalties last weekend against 
the Buckeyes. Obviously, staying 
out of the box is the best option, 
but it’s one of those things that is 
much easier said than done.

While the Wolverines’ roster 

might have the talent to be at 
least an effective penalty kill, 
that ship sailed a long time ago. 
With at most four games left in 
the season, Michigan is what it 
is. If the Wolverines are to beat 
Northeastern, it almost certainly 
will come in spite of their special 
teams, not because of it

Freshman defenseman Quinn Hughes and the rest of Michigan’s defense needs to be clicking on all cylinders in order to stop Northeastern’s dynamic offense.
