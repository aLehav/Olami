This year’s Central Student 

Government 
elections 
saw 

significantly 
lower 
numbers 

of 
voter 
participation 
in 

comparison to recent years. 
According to an email interview 
from 
Public 
Policy 
senior 

Jacob 
Pearlman, 
the 
CSG 

election director, a total of 
7,989 students, or 17.9 percent 
of the student body, voted in 
this 
year’s 
presidential 
and 

vice-presidential 
election. 
In 

2016, voter turnout came in at 
19.1 percent of the student body, 
while in 2015, 20.1 percent of 
students voted.

Engaging with the student 

body has been a priority for 
CSG in recent years, especially 
considering 
the 
fact 
that 

many students attribute their 
decision not to vote to a lack of 
knowledge of what CSG is and 
what specific actions the body 
takes throughout the year. For 
LSA sophomore Chang Yang, 
this year’s CSG elections were 
not something she felt was very 
prevalent around campus.

“I just felt very disconnected, 

to be honest, from the CSG 
campaigns to begin with,” Yang 
said. “They were just some 
things that kind of happened in 
the background. I would have to 
see more of how much CSG plays 
in the roles or the effects it has 
on the actual student body, or 
how effective it is in doing things 
for me, to care more about voting 

in their elections.”

Pearlman agreed that this sort 

of unfamiliarity from students 
with their governing bodies has 
provided reason for them not to 
take part in elections. He also 
highlighted instances in which 
students made their decisions 
not to vote based on issues they 
may have encountered with 
previous administrations.

“Low 
turnout 
could 

be 
attributed 
to 
students’ 

disenchantment 
with 
the 

outgoing CSG leadership,” he 
said. “I’ve talked to countless 
students who felt as though 
the promises made last year 
to bring more transparency 
and inclusivity to CSG went 
unfulfilled — and it made 
students feel as though their 
voice and vote did not matter 
this year.”

When it came to the voting 

process 
itself, 
Pearlman 

explained that a campus-wide 
email was sent to students to 

let them know the polls had 
opened. These polls, which 
were available at vote.umich.
edu, were open for 48 hours. 
Once they closed, results were 
automatically 
tallied 
online 

and CSG members filtered out 
ballots from unenrolled students 
and, according to Pearlman, the 
ballots “which were deemed 
vulgar or inappropriate.”

The 
University 
is 
home 

to about 45,000 students of 
different genders, races and 
religions, but these differences 
are not discussed on a daily 
basis. With the intention of 
addressing 
this 
issue 
and 

creating a campus fostering 
the inclusion specifically of 
people of all genders, the Sexual 
Assault Prevention Awareness 
Center 
has 
partnered 
with 

the LSA Student Government 
to create a dialogue series. By 
fostering a safe and “brave” 
discussion space, the first of 
this series, held Wednesday 
night, hoped to normalize the 
use of gender-neutral pronouns 
and the explain stigma that 
surrounds them.

Led by two coordinators — 

LSA sophomore Eve Hillman, a 
SAPAC peer educator, and LSA 
junior Elaina Rahrig, an LSA SG 
member — the discussion group 
reflected the diverse campus 
environment.

Examining the ties between race and tenure:

underrepresented minority faculty count remains stagnant

DESIGN BY OLIVIA STILLMAN

DEI strategic plan proposes change in hiring and recruiting practices, as candidates of color still encounter implicit bias

Along with efforts to increase 

student diversity on campus, the 
42-page Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion plan outlines the need to 
increase diversity among faculty. As 
of the plan’s launch last October, the 
percentage of underrepresented-
minority tenured faculty at the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
has 

not changed from 2011 to 2016, 
according to records compiled by 
University Public Affairs.

In a headcount of total tenured 

and tenure-track faculty between 
2011 and 2016, the total percentage 
of all minorities increased by 2 
percent—from 24 percent in 2011 
to 26 percent in 2016, according to 
the Faculty Headcount report from 
the Office of Budget and Planning. 
The percentage of female tenured 
faculty also increased: from 30 
percent in 2011 to 34 percent 
in 2016. While these numbers 
appear to show a gradual increase 
in 
faculty 
diversification 
that 

the DEI plan can improve upon, 
Alec Gallimore, the dean of the 
College of Engineering, said Asian 
populations account for a large 

percentage of University faculty 
and can warp diversity statistics.

“I knew that we could not 

have 
20-something 
percent 

underrepresented minorities on 
the faculty at the University of 
Michigan,” he said. “That didn’t 
make sense. Asian-Americans, in 
any field like engineering … are 
often overrepresented in terms 
of percentage of students and 
faculty versus underrepresented 
minorities, which are obviously 
underrepresented.”

The 
underrepresented 

minorities included in the data 
— composing categories of Black, 

Hispanic, Native American, Pacific 
Islander, and two or more races — 
show a more flatlined percentage 
between the years the data covers. 
From 2011 to 2016, the proportion 
of such faculty stayed at 10 percent. 

In an interview, Chief Diversity 

Officer Robert Sellers, vice provost 
for equity and inclusion, said the 
data shows more work has to be 
done to increase diversity among 
faculty, but also noted figures 
from individual colleges may look 
different.

“I think it’s very complex,” 

Sellers said. “I think we have a ways 
to go to diversifying our faculty to 

look broader and look like the larger 
society and larger community. 
That’s one of the reasons why 
we’re doing our DEI work. At the 
same point in time, those numbers 
themselves, while important, don’t 
tell the whole story. They look 
different in different contexts and 
different spaces.”

According to an excerpt from 

the 
College 
of 
Engineering’s 

annual Office of the Provost report 
provided by Gallimore, women 
make up 20 percent of engineering 
tenure and tenure-track faculty and 
underrepresented minorities make 
up 6 percent. Advance gathered 

data from 2016 on LSA and the 
Medical School, which reported 
an LSA tenure and tenure-track 
underrepresented-minority 
percentage of 6 percent and a 
Medical School (Basic Sciences) 
percentage of 5 percent.

Tabbye Chavous, the director 

of 
the 
National 
Center 
for 

Institutional 
Diversity 
and 

Education and a professor of 
education and psychology, said 
the larger data for all minorities 
and women should not give a false 
sense of security in the University’s 
efforts to improve diversity. The

class times come up so fast 
like where did that 2 and a half 
hour break go 

Squirrels are a 

prominent facet of the 
University of Michigan 
campus. From the 
University’s Squirrel 
Club, which meets 
twice a week to feed the 
squirrels, to the regular 
postings of pictures of 
these friendly rodents to 
social media— there is no 
question that squirrels 
are a staple of the 
University experience.

Corey Seeman, 

director of Kresge 
Library Services at the 
Ross School of Business, 
is no stranger to this 
population.

Since beginning 

photography as a hobby 
in 2007, Seeman has 
taken tens of thousands 
of images of squirrels, 
he told The University 
Record. He said he has 

taken at least one picture 
of squirrels every day for 
the past nine years.

All of his 

photographs can be 
viewed on his Flickr 
photo gallery, which 
displays these furry 
animals inhabiting all 
parts of the Michigan 
campus.

Squirrels in the snow, 

squirrels in trees and 
even squirrels enjoying 
peanuts are all on 
display in his 321-page 
photo gallery.

There is no question 

that Seeman’s “got 
squirrels,” so it only 
seems fitting that the 
introduction to his 
gallery reads “Got 
Squirrels? I do.”

National Center for Educational 
Statistics reported in 2013 the 
national 
underrepresented 

minority percentage of all faculty 
as roughly 11.8 percent. When 
calculated, Stanford University’s 
2015 underrepresented-minority 
faculty statistic was roughly 11 
percent. 

“It think it reflects progress 

and, unfortunately, data that are 
often stronger than other higher 
education 
institutions,” 
she 

said. “That said, I don’t think we 
should be satisfied. … We have a 
lot of work to do to increase those 
numbers.”

Through 
the 
DEI 
rollout 

and 
public 
statements 
this 

year, President Mark Schlissel 
has stressed the importance of 
diversity in academia multiple 
times. In October, he said he wants 
everyone to be able to work and 
improve the quality of education 
at the University.

“We cannot live up to our full 

potential as a university unless 
everyone has an equal opportunity 
to contribute and to benefit,” he 

said.

Sellers said this current lack of 

diversity for tenured faculty limits 
the ability of the University to 
expand its pedagogical horizons 
to truly innovate.

“It’s not just diversity in terms 

of the demographics, it’s diversity 
with respect to the nature and 
the content of the scholarship and 
pedagogy that’s being delivered 
then is really important,” Sellers 
said. “We know that having 
diverse perspectives leads to more 
creative problem solving, leads to 
more problem-solving solutions 
and ultimately to more effective 
problem solving.”

Sections of the DEI underline 

the 
consequences 
a 
lack 
of 

diversity has on the University. 
The overarching plan also created 
a working group under the Office 
of the Provost to investigate how 
best to incorporate faculty DEI 
contributions in tenure reviews.

“Women and underrepresented 

minority faculty are more likely 
to report experiences of bias and 
exclusion and are more likely to 
report not having influence and 
voice within their departments,” 
the plan reads.

While 
the 
DEI 
mentions 

plans in place at the University 
and new initiatives to increase 
faculty diversity, Chavous said 
concrete action and visible results 
are different than simply listing 
resources.

“The elements are in the plan,” 

she said. “There’s real attention 
and resources to support units in 
recruiting faculty and developing 
better practices for recruitment … 
and attention to issues of retention, 
but I think the magic will come in 
the implementation. The plan, the 
elements are there, the resources 
are there, accountability is there 
but I think it will be critically 
important to pay attention to 
implementation.”

After 
working 
on 
and 

researching the tenure track 
for a number of years at the 
University, the actual process 
for being promoted to tenure is 
another hurdle limiting a diverse 
faculty body. The number of 
panels formed and decisions 
made to award tenure ultimately 
involve 
dozens 
of 
University 

faculty: department professors, 
department chairs, deans, the 
president and the regents are 
all consulted in the decision. 
Because of the large number of 

people involved in promotional 
decisions, 
Gallimore 
argued 

implicit bias can stifle diversity 
of tenured faculty, according to 
University sources.

Bias in the hiring process, 

he said, is a large cause of the 
University’s lack of diversity and 
colleges’ administrators should 
try and work to acknowledge 
bias 
and 
improve 
hiring 

practices.

“We 
all 
suffer 
from 

unconscious bias,” Gallimore 
said. “That’s what part of being 
human is about, and the question 
is how do we recognize that we 
all suffer from unconscious bias, 
how do we recognize that people 
who, for example, write letters 
also suffer from unconscious 
bias and how do we compensate 
for that when we’re evaluating 
potential 
faculty 
members, 

having 
discussions 
about 

faculty members, frankly about 
promotion and tenure, etc.”

Stop asking Black boys 
why they don’t play sports

What being in “The Vagina 
Monologues” taught me

20 questions about 
DEI GSSAs answered

We are currently in the thick 

of March Madness, a time of 
year when it seems as though 
everyone is an expert in all 
things basketball. People are 
filling out brackets, making 
bets and anxiously watching 
as many games as they possibly 
can. This time, more than 
ever, I am reminded of one of 
the things that annoyed me 
most during my childhood, 
along with being the cause of 
a lot of anxiety and decreased 
self-esteem. When I met new 
people, usually adults, or saw 
family members whom I did 
not see on a regular basis, they 
would ask me, “Do you play 
any sports?” Now this in itself 
is harmless. Every given year, 
I was one of the tallest people 
in my grade. After my awkward 
pre-teen 
phase, 
I 
slimmed 

down and started to work out 
at my mom’s gym occasionally. 
It was not unusual for people 
to comment on my “athletic” 
physique, and the affirmation 
was a positive reinforcement. 
It really was no surprise that 
people thought I would be an 
athlete.

In 
reply 
to 
the 

aforementioned 
question, 

“Do you play any sports?” 
I would simply say no and 
smile. However awkward, all 
of this is fine and completely 
normal. Sports are a big part of 
American culture and most of 
my peers played them. So what 
was the issue? It lay in one 
word: Why?

Now this always seemed like 

a very loaded question, and 
I never knew exactly how to 
respond. I would say, “I’m just 
not into them,” or something 
of the sort. If I was lucky, they 
would leave it at that; however, 
sometimes they would say some 
pretty 
demoralizing 
things. 

One 
family 
member 
even 

told me that I was “a waste of 
height and size.” This comment 
bothered 
me 
for 
obvious 

reasons, but mostly because 
it seemed like people were 
never interested in all of my 
other qualities and interests. 
I enjoyed reading books on 
presidential history, catching 
up on politics and cooking new 
foods.

For a short period in middle 

school, I played baseball and 
ran track. Though I liked the 
challenge and opportunity to 
spend time with my friends 
outside of school, I knew that 
I was not an athlete. I actually 
fractured my ankle sliding into 
home base and was forced to 
wear a cast and then a boot 
for the better part of a year. 
Nonetheless, this piece is not 
at all my attempt at criticizing 
athletes or organized sports. I 
am not oblivious to the many 
positive effects that sports 
can have on youth: the ability 
to bond as a team, have a 
sense of responsibility and 
opportunity to compete with 
peers by constructive means 
are just some of the benefits. 
In more urban communities, 
specifically, 
sports 
can 
be 

pivotal 
in 
establishing 
a 

relationship between a coach 
and his players where many of 

them may not have a paternal 
figure in their lives. Sports can 
also give an out to students 
looking 
to 
escape 
violence 

and 
other 
disadvantageous 

situations.

However, 
in 
the 
Black 

community, 
sports 
are 

sometimes viewed as the only 
way to prosperity. This could 
be because the entertainment 
industry 
has 
for 
so 
long 

capitalized 
on 
the 
athletic 

ambitions of Black boys in 
conjunction with the general 
public’s appetite to consume 
such media. This, all the while 
collecting the lion’s share of 
multi-million 
dollar 
profits. 

For example, about three in 
four NBA players are Black; 
however, owners in the league 
are almost exclusively white.

I want my point to be clear: 

Stop asking Black boys why 
they don’t play sports because 
it is in turn reducing them to 
your entertainment. Instead, 
start seeing Black boys as 
intellectuals. Start seeing Black 
boys as artists, public servants 
and CEOs.

Let’s encourage more Black 

youth to code, draw and write 
columns for their school paper. 
The world needs more Black 
leaders, and today’s kids have 
to be inspired to chase those 
dreams. And with all of that 
being said, it is crucial to still 
acknowledge that kids can be 
whatever they want in life. So, 
if after you’ve encouraged him 
to be ambitious, and that Black 
boy wants to be a basketball 
player, go to the bleachers and 
cheer him on.

During the intermission after 

the student-written portion of 
“The Vagina Monologues” on 
Friday night, I was walking 
through the audience to find my 
friends and ask them if they were 
enjoying the show. Along the way, 
I was stopped by a girl I didn’t 
know.

“That 
was 
amazing,” 
she 

said, “Thank you so much for 
producing this show.” I thanked 
her right back for the praise. As I 
walked away, she and her friend 
starting 
discussing 
“Beauty 

in Color,” a piece I casted and 
wrote with a Black girl (shout-
out to Aaliyah Jihad at New York 
University) about white beauty 
standards affecting our love lives.

I still remember writing that 

poem. We were both still in high 
school, both had never had serious 
boyfriends, both still virgins. And 
yet, somehow we had stories. Men 
shouting about wanting “to fuck 
an Asian / Black girl like you.” 
Saying that we were pretty for 
an “Asian / Black girl.” Calling us 
“unique” and “different” because 
of our skin. Though we had barely 
ever spoken before, our stories 
poured out of us — of being left at 
school dances, in cars, abandoned 
for someone lighter, blonder, 
feeling insecure, inferior, ugly, 
undesirable, alone. And here, 
where we felt the most alone, we 
looked at each other, strangers 
at first, and realized we were not 
alone.

Stories are very important to 

me. They’re how we share and 
hold memories. They’re how we 
learn more about people. They 
can be passed down through time, 
keeping languages and traditions 
alive. They can make you cry. 
They can make you laugh. They 
can help you learn how to care 
about people and sympathize 
with a struggle that may not be 
your own. They can help you feel 
less alone.

I’ve 
been 
attending 
“The 

Vagina 
Monologues” 
since 

freshman year. The first year, I 
was in the crowd. While watching, 
I realized that I had lost my 
virginity before I even touched 
my vagina. It never occurred to 
me that the vaginal canal could be 
a space for me and not him. The 

second and third years, I was in 
the cast. When I performed “The 
Village,” a piece created from the 
stories of Bosnian women who 
were raped during the Bosnian 
War of the 1990s, I had difficulty 
connecting to the subject matter. 
I did not even know where Bosnia 
and Herzegovina was on a map, 
let alone know anything about 
war or assault or any theme 
covered in the piece. What made 
me learn empathy was realizing 
that the events discussed were 
not isolated to just that war. 
Learning about the Rape of 
Nanking in an Asian Studies 
course made me realize that I was 
naive to think that rape as a war 
tactic was unique. It’s disgusting, 
inhumane, 
painful, 
real 
and 

common. Maybe it’s dumb that 
I started to understand once the 
victim was Chinese. But with a 
familiar face, I started being able 
to imagine myself there. Learning 
that story is how I learned to 
sympathize.

And this year, I produced the 

show with Clare Fairbanks, an 
LS&A junior, as the director. 
I 
wanted 
to 
produce 
“The 

Vagina Monologues” because I 
wanted to change “The Vagina 
Monologues.” The show had been 
receiving criticism for being a 
cis-white-feminist show. I can’t 
really deny the accuracy of that 
statement. But I felt like there was 
something there to save. There is 
value in a name and a brand with 
draw and power. The year prior 
the director, Angelle Antoun, 
an LS&A senior, started to add 
student-written monologues to 
the show. These were the stories 
that I wanted to see on the stage. 
Real 
representation 
of 
who 

we are as a campus, in all our 
diversity, tragedy and comedy. 
Yes, I wanted there to be more 
racial diversity. Yes, I wanted 
more than one token trans piece. 
Yes, I probably rejected a lot of 
great, fantastic, white actresses 
who deserved parts to get the 
faces I wanted to see. I wanted 
people in the audience to be able 
to look up and feel like they were 
being heard when listening to 
someone else speak. The girl who 
complimented the show during 
intermission, she was Asian. I 
hope she liked “Beauty in Color” 
because she saw herself in the 
story and saw that people were 
fighting for her.

And oh my god, is fighting 

tiring. I cried six times in one 
day last week. I couldn’t stay 
in class. When asked, “Why do 
you think Asians do not appear 
as often in racial protests?” I 
replied, 
“Because 
it’s 
easier 

to ignore the pain than feel it 
when it’s not your own,” and 
ran out of the room. Honestly, 
I wish I didn’t feel as intensely 
as I feel. I wish I could look at a 
listicle trivializing the events 
in our pre-show on a University 
of Michigan-sponsored website 
and write off as a joke. Just a bad 
review. But it’s not about a bad 
review. It’s not just one dumb guy. 
It’s the fact that I’m well aware 
that all I did with all my time, 
the hours of rehearsal, casting, 
sourcing material, worry — was 
to put on one little show — a drop 
in a bucket. All I wanted was for 
people to listen. I forgot how 
people can sit their ass in a chair 
for two hours and hear every 
word but not listen at all. It’s 
the fact that I know the review 
probably won’t be removed, even 
though we were misquoted and 
he never asked us if he could use 
the words we wrote, even though 
we clearly stated that he had to. 
That the material was sensitive, 
private. That even when you do 
the best job you can and things 
go better than you thought they 
would, of course — of course — 
it’s never enough. That there 
are many people who think I’m 
crazy for being mad at all. That 
people think I’m crazy to think 
that anything would change. 
That I think I’m crazy sometimes 
that I even try. That you can 
watch someone telling you about 
something 
deeply 
personal, 

something the people closest to 
them may not know, just because 
they want to feel understood, just 
because they hope that hearing 
them will help you be understood, 
and you can still push them down. 
How can you look them in the 
eye and not feel something too? 
It’s the fact that there is so much 
fighting left to do.

I am so tired.
But I have to. But we have to. 

The pain must be felt and shared 
until it fucking stops. There must 
still be hope that one day it’ll stop, 
and that every little performance 
pushes us in that direction.

That is what “The Vagina 

Monologues” has taught me.

During contract negotiations 

this year, the Graduate Employees’ 
Organization issued a proposal to 
create 23 paid, unionized graduate 
student positions dedicated to 
implementing 
Diversity, 
Equity 

and Inclusion strategic plans at the 
University of Michigan. This plan 
to create DEI Graduate Student 
Staff Assistants was developed by 
campus leaders involved in DEI 
organizing 
and 
represented 
a 

grassroots, bottom-up, initiative to 
align the University’s DEI values 
with real-world practice. GEO is 
committed to seeing the proposal’s 
acceptance because it directly 
contributes to equity on campus in 
a systematic way.

Last month, Academic Human 

Resources rejected the proposal 
during bargaining sessions with 
GEO, and our communities have 
responded: So far, 42 organizations 
and more than 1,100 students, 
faculty and staff have expressed 
their endorsement of our campaign 
to Pay Students for Diversity Labor.

Despite broad support for the 

creation of DEI GSSAs, many 
UM 
administrators 
are 
still 

unwilling to discuss the merits 
of the proposal with us. We 
believe this may be because of 
confusion about the specifics of 
our proposal. Here we respond to 
20 frequently asked questions and 
common misperceptions regarding 
the 
creation 
of 
DEI 
GSSAs, 

some of which were generated 
through conversations with the 
administrators who were willing 
to speak with us. We invite anyone 
in 
the 
community, 
especially 

administrators, to reach out to us 
directly if you would like to see 

additional 
questions 
answered. 

Please share this with faculty, staff 
and student leaders engaged in DEI 
work. Our objective is to work with 
administrators to fairly compensate 
graduate student DEI labor, but 
without your help, UM leadership 
will not seriously consider our 
proposal.

1. How do we know that unpaid 
student diversity labor actually 
exists?

We believe the University’s 

priority should be to create paid 
student positions, and not to collect 
more data on whether this is an 
issue. Student-led organizations 
from across the campus community 
have 
endorsed 
our 
campaign 

because 
their 
membership 
is 

aware of unpaid diversity labor 
as a problem in their schools. We 
have also collected anonymous 
stories and examples from graduate 
students who have engaged in 
diversity labor by helping their 
schools or departments implement 
DEI strategic plans. Members of 
our organizing coalition know 
from experience that students are 
routinely asked by administrators 
to help with DEI planning and 
implementation. 
This 
labor 

tends to be informal, ad-hoc and 
uncompensated.

2. 
The 
University 
already 

provides space for student input 
in the form of town halls and the 
DEI student advisory boards. 
Why is it necessary to create 
formal positions for students 
when an existing mechanism for 
feedback exists?

Our petition, and our statement 

we published in The Michigan 
Daily, are also a source of student 
feedback; graduate students see 
the value of officially recognized 
and compensated roles within the 
DEI implementation infrastructure 
that adequately value their time 

and expertise. Hiring GSSAs to 
play a key role in implementation 
would integrate student voices into 
strategic planning at a level equal to 
that of faculty and staff.

3. Why should students carry 
the burden of doing DEI labor 
at all? Faculty and staff should 
be implementing these strategic 
plans, not students. 

In 
order 
for 
the 
strategic 

planning process itself to be 
both 
equitable 
and 
inclusive, 

students must be part of the DEI 
implementation 
infrastructure. 

Students deserve an opportunity 
to be involved in a greater capacity 
than simply sharing feedback in 
town hall settings. The real value 
of DEI planning lay in the details 
— details that students need to 
understand 
intimately. 
When 

student 
engagement 
is 
absent 

from the implementation process, 
mistakes are made that force 
students to respond reactively. By 
allowing students to help execute 
programs, DEI GSSAs would serve 
a proactive role in ensuring policies 
and programs address students’ 
needs.

4. Students’ role is to receive 
services from the University, 
not provide them. It is not 
their responsibility to do DEI 
work. Shouldn’t we reduce or 
eliminate the student diversity 
labor burden altogether instead 
of paying for it?

Students are already providing 

DEI labor. This work should be 
recognized, valued and formalized. 
Students often find themselves 
doing 
DEI 
labor 
because 
it 

contributes 
to 
their 
survival, 

and because they (and their 
departments) know they are the

T

here has been a great 
deal 
of 
justifiable 

outcry from graduating 

students with regard to the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 

decision to replace a traditional 
commencement address with a 
multimedia presentation that 
stitches together past speeches. 

This deviation from the status 

quo on the University’s 200th 
birthday feels counterintuitive. 
Why break from tradition for 
a celebration that is steeped in 
it? Though it may not be the 
University’s intention, replacing 
the big-name speaker with a 
video compilation makes a major 
milestone (for the class of 2017 
and the University alike) seem 
like an afterthought.

There are myriad reasons 

members of the graduating class 
are disappointed and angry, but 
the crux is that the University’s 
administration largely ignored 
our voices en route to designing 
the commencement ceremony. 
The 
finalized 
lineup 
comes 

after more than 1,000 students 
signed a petition protesting the 
elimination of a traditional 
commencement 
speaker, 

and 
after 
the 
Bicentennial 

Office received survey results 
revealing 
that 
97 
percent 

of 
respondents 
expressed 

negative 
opinions 
about 

replacing the commencement 
address with a video.

University spokeswoman Kim 

Broekhuizen wrote in an email, 
“The university has worked for 
the last year to gather student 
input 
on 
the 
bicentennial 

commencement 
and 
involve 

students 
in 
planning 
this 

special occasion.” But multiple 
student leaders raised concerns 
to members of the University 
administration to no avail.

Engineering 
senior 

Clare 
Hyde, 
who 
served 

as a representative on the 
Bicentennial Commencement 
Student Advisory Committee, 
said in a statement to The 
Tab that when she brought 
up the survey results showing 
student 
resistance 
to 
the 

multimedia 
presentation, 

a staff member responded, 
“We’re going to try to focus on 
the graduating students, but 
that’s going to be hard.”

Similarly, LSA senior Aaron 

Cahen, who led Central Student 
Government’s 
liaison 
efforts 

with the Bicentennial Office, 
said in an interview that even 
though he and several others 
told the administration the video 
presentation wasn’t a good idea, 
“It doesn’t appear that pretty 
much any of it (our suggestions) 
was incorporated in any way, 
shape or form.” 

Systems were put in place 

for student involvement here, 
so where was the disconnect? 
Why was it that students were 
sought out and asked for their 
input, only to produce results 
that don’t reflect that input? 
Clearly, 
the 
Bicentennial 

Office and the graduating 
class 
had 
different 
ideas 

about the role bicentennial 
celebrations should play in 

commencement.

Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 

Prof. Malcolm Tulip, who is 
responsible for creating the now-
infamous video presentation, 
previously said in a press release 
the video will allow graduates 
and their families to “gain 
a sense of their place in the 
university and nation’s history.”

Understanding the greater 

context of one’s experiences 
is important — who are we to 
face and attempt to tackle the 
problems of this world without 
understanding 
how 
they’ve 

come to exist in the first place? 
In this sense, a compilation 
video of past speeches actually 
has the potential to be great by 
weaving a unique narrative from 
the combined voices of others.

To be fair, the forthcoming 

“multimedia presentation” is 
something we’d be excited to 
see on YouTube or Facebook. 
But we’re just not interested in 
watching a historical hype video 
on the jumbotron at graduation 
in lieu of a live address. Our 
frustration is that the University 
seems 
to 
have 
abandoned 

making 
commencement 

a 
reflective, 
standalone 

experience for graduates in 
favor of creating a reusable, 
promotional sizzle reel.

The 
administration 
had 

an opportunity to integrate 
bicentennial 
celebrations 

into our commencement in a 
way that highlighted the best 
aspects of both. The concern 
now is that the bicentennial will 
overshadow our commencement 
and, consequently, devalue the 
accomplishment of graduating. 
So much for a positive send-off.

In her statement to The Tab, 

Hyde speculated that getting rid 
of the traditional keynote speaker 
was a move by the University to 
control the message given at 
commencement, and claimed 
that the decision is “merely an 
attempt to be non-controversial 
after some previous speeches.”

This may refer to Michael 

Bloomberg’s 
address 
at 
last 

year’s commencement, which 
generated 
national 
headlines 

for 
criticizing 
university 

administrations that “bow to 
pressure and shield students 
from 
(controversial) 
ideas 

through 
‘safe 
spaces, 
‘code 

words’ and ‘trigger warnings.’ ”

University President Mark 

Schlissel 
has 
previously 

espoused the importance of 
engaging with “the conflict of 
discordant ideas and opinions.” 
If Hyde’s allegations are true, 
few decisions could be more 
contrary to this practice than 
refusing student requests for 
a graduation speaker in an 
effort 
to 
prevent 
potential 

controversy on the University’s 
200th birthday.

Some 
students 
have 
also 

suggested that the University 
may have had difficulty finding 
a 
big-name 
speaker 
and 

therefore decided not to have 
one at all. The irony is that 
the administration had ample 
opportunity to hire an amazing 
keynote speaker — and we know 

this because some incredible 
people will be in attendance at 
commencement anyway.

Academy Award- and Golden 

Globe-winning composers will 
perform a song they wrote for 
“La La Land,” and no fewer than 
10 incredible alumni will also be 
at the event to receive accolades. 
We’d prefer a keynote speech 
from any one of these extremely 
accomplished graduates to not 
having one at all — even if these 
folks aren’t as famous as former 
President Barack Obama or 
ex-Twitter CEO Dick Costolo.

However, without a keynote 

speaker or an alternate way to 
tailor the event to the graduating 
class, 
the 
alumni 
awards 

seem jarringly out of place. 
The heavy focus on alumni at 
commencement has led some in 
the graduating class to believe, 
even if it’s not true, that the event 
is primarily focused on building 
alumni relations and bolstering 
fundraising efforts.

It feels like the University 

has 
appropriated 
our 

commencement 
ceremony 
to 

organize a fundraising ploy 
that honors its most successful 
previous 
graduates. 
That’s 

hard to swallow when some 
current graduates-to-be have 
just finished paying tuition and 
others haven’t begun paying off 
student loans. We’re proud of 
our alumni, and believe these 
inspiring people more than 
deserve 
the 
awards 
they’re 

receiving. But, as many students 
have expressed, commencement 
isn’t the time or place.

Ultimately, 
CSG 
President 

David Schafer, an LSA senior, 
said in an interview that he’s 
learned “things don’t end well” 
when students aren’t consulted 
on the issues that directly affect 
them. “Students have their finger 
on the pulse in ways that no 
other constituent or stakeholder 
at this University has,” he said. 
We overwhelmingly agree.

Commencement is case in 

point. Even if the ceremony still 
has the power to be meaningful 
and memorable (which it does), 
it was not handled in a way 
that reflects our constituency’s 
feedback. The reality, then, is 
that the University is leaving 
a bad taste in the mouths of 
the people it was supposed 
to celebrate — and that’s an 
unfortunate way to culminate 
our experiences here.

Most University graduates 

remember who delivered their 
commencement address, even 
if they don’t remember the 
minutiae of the speech itself. 
At this school, we’ve come to 
understand 
commencement 

as a defining moment of our 
education, something we all 
work toward and a memory 
meant to last a lifetime. The 
University 
prides 
itself 
on 

grooming the Leaders and the 
Best; this decision fails to meet 
that standard. It’s not too late 
to fix it.

I

f there’s one thing that 
I 
can 
recommend 
to 

incoming 
University 
of 

Michigan students, it would be 
to eat your macaroni 
straight out of the 
pan (no extra dish 
to clean — life hack). 
After that, though, I 
would say everyone 
should 
understand 

that there is a really 
good 
chance 
that 

you will be victim of 
some sort of horrible 
administrative 
nonsense at least once, 
and that handling it with some 
flexibility and humor is definitely 
going to save you some grief.

This university is huge and 

most of us have at least one 
instance of special circumstances 
that 
mess 
with 
transcripts, 

schedules, living situations or one 
of myriad bits of minutiae that 
compose the everyday experience 
of college life.

This 
extends 
outside 
of 

school too; our world can seem 
like one long stream of random 
administrative annoyances. And, 
while there are plenty of online 
resources to check in with to 
figure things out, ultimately, it’s 
up to the individual to make sense 
of it and figure out how to handle 
it without losing his or her mind.

To 
illustrate 
this, 
I 
was 

a transfer student after my 
freshman year, and I can point to 
approximately 6 million personal 
examples 
of 
administrative 

nuances that have tried to screw 
me over. There was a mistake in 
sending my transcripts first, then 
my prerequisites were jumbled 
in the system, then I found out 
that when my credits from my 
quarter-system 
school 
were 

moved to the semester system, 
it gave my transfer classes odd 
thirds of credits that I had to 
figure out how to distribute neatly 
to stay on track for graduation.

Possibly the most frustrating 

thing that I went through, though, 
was when I had to petition for my 
honors writing course from my 

previous university to 
count as my first-year 
writing requirement 
here. The non-honors 
writing course that 
I could have taken 
at 
my 
old 
school 

was 
automatically 

accepted 
at 
the 

University as counting 
for 
this 
freshman 

requirement, 
but 

the more advanced 

alternative wasn’t. I had to 
submit paperwork, syllabi and 
an extensive write-up about that 
writing course for the school to 
even consider that this honors 
course could count.

That’s ridiculously frustrating, 

right?

As irritating as that whole 

thing was, though, I can’t say that 
it was completely unexpected 
since, in my experience, living in 
an organized society sometimes 
just means dealing with series 
of unfathomable oddities. In 
essence, a lot of life is just one long 
“what the hell?” feeling followed 
by 
resigned 
sighing. 
What 

actually counts is how we handle 
these moments of frustration.

It might be easiest to write 

these things off as meaningless 
confusions, 
things 
that 
we 

just might have to live with as 
unchangeable, but these same 
points of annoyance could also be 
opportunities to prove to yourself 
that you are an agile person, 
willing to roll with the punches. 
Stress can lead to anxiety, or it 
can be viewed as a chance to rise 
to the occasion.

For instance, with my transfer-

credit petition, was I annoyed 
and confused about why I had 
to do it? Absolutely. That saga 
was an unprecedented amount 
of nonsense and hurdles, even 

for me (and I go out of my way to 
seek out more nonsense). But I 
also decided that, because it was 
a necessity that I had to power 
through, I at least had the power 
to decide how to view the process.

For me, I’d like to look at 

that undertaking as being both 
an average tale about being 
prepared 
to 
wade 
through 

some paperwork to get things 
completely straightened out — 
the more traditional view on such 
an event — and also a tale of my 
new school challenging me to be 
the proactive, assertive person 
it wanted me to be and to fight 
for my desired result — the less 
traditional way of looking at this.

As someone who is about to 

graduate and move onto a new 
step in my life, this outlook on 
nonsense as an opportunity for 
interpretation or reflection can 
be very comforting. I don’t know 
what’s waiting for me out there, 
but I know that, for the most part, 
I can take life how I want, and 
decide what lessons to take away 
from what I find.

Assuming that there’s a whole 

lot of nonsense waiting for me out 
there to tease apart and analyze, 
I have full confidence in myself to 
work these things out, largely from 
my chance to prove I can whenever 
things get strange and annoying. If 
I can deal with all of the obstacles 
that transferring presents and 
choose to find a positive lesson in 
that, then I can almost definitely 
deal with whatever gibberish I 
encounter outside of school in a 
meaningful way.

Really, though, the little bits 

of annoyances in life can add up 
to an overwhelming amount if 
you let them. But not only will 
you be happier — the people 
around will thank you if you 
take life with a grain of salt and 
roll with the punches.

Roll with the punches

onday, March 20, was 
the International Day 
of Happiness, a day 

that would’ve gone otherwise 
unnoticed to me had 
I not serendipitously 
stumbled 
across 
a 

“Happy Acts” wall 
that asked me how 
I would go about 
spreading happiness. 
The answer came to 
me with surprising 
ease: “I will share 
happiness 
by: 

showing people that 
life gets better.” I 
was 
surprised, 
because 
a 

little more than a year ago, I 
would’ve thought that I had 
no happiness to give.

I’ve long been known as 

the happy girl, with a smile 
ever-present on my face and a 
penchant for laugher but few 
people know that, for a period of 
about two years at the end of high 
school, the smiles were more of a 
facade. I’m not sure exactly when 
it began, but there became a time 
when I would dread waking up 
and facing the day, and trudge 
through it with complete apathy. 
I was filled with self-loathing, my 
self-esteem was at an all-time low 
and thoughts of suicide pervaded 
my life on a daily basis. It was a 
miserable way to live — if it could 
even be called living.

Although 
I 
was 
never 

diagnosed, a subconscious part 
of me recognized my symptoms 
for what they were. I didn’t dare 
tell anyone, because I was the 
happy girl, and happy girls who 
grow up in the lap of privilege 
don’t get depressed — at least, 
they don’t have any reason to be. 
Of course, I was plagued with 
many of the problems commonly 
faced by teenage girls — high-
school drama, a severe lack of 
sleep and the stress of school 
— but in a world full of “real” 
problems so much more serious 
than mine, it felt silly to think 
that my problems warranted 
sadness and depression. My diary 
took the brunt of my private 
dark thoughts, while I pasted 
on a smile and forced laughter 
in public, because that was what 
was expected of me.

The end of my senior year 

of high school was a dark time, 
as anxieties about college built 
on top of existing anxieties, but 

things started to turn around 
at my high school’s all-night 
senior party, when an astrologist 
saw my depression in the stars. 

“You have been in a 
dark place since the 
winter of 2014,” she 
read with startling 
accuracy, “but things 
will 
turn 
around 

this fall.” Somehow, 
those words were 
the ember of hope I 
never knew I needed. 
Critical 
as 
I 
was 

about astrology and 
fortune telling, I was 

also desperate for some divine 
sign that there was light in my 
future. When one unexpectedly 
presented itself, I took it. Clinging 
to the hope that my stars were 
right, I gave life a chance, and 
it’s carried me through the 
aforementioned fall into a spring 
full of life and happiness.

I still don’t know if I believe 

in astrology, but that astrologist 
undoubtedly saved my life. It 
was not grand nor life-changing 
to anyone besides myself, but 
through the smallest pinch of 
hope, she gave me a lifeline. If I 
had followed through every time 
I seriously considered suicide, 
I never would’ve seen today, 
when I am finally content and 
at the pinnacle of my happiness. 
Again, I’m not exactly sure when 
my perspective on life began 
to change, but some time along 
the way, it felt like a curtain was 
lifted, revealing the beautiful 
world 
that 
depression 
had 

hidden. It’s difficult to describe, 
but the whole world seems 
clearer, and even the simplest of 
things, such as a sunny day or a 
Diag squirrel, can put a genuine 
smile on my face for the rest of the 
day. I lived for so long in a dark 
haze that it is important to me 
to treasure each and every day of 
clarity. If anything, I’m grateful 
for that period of darkness, 
because it gave me a much greater 
appreciation for life.

My journey to where I am 

today was a slow one, which 
involved lots of self-reflection and 
journaling, an attempt at fixing 
my sleep schedule and the gradual 
declaration of independence of my 
self-worth from arbitrary things, 
such as grades, other people’s 
opinions or a number on a scale. 
Tyler Knott Gregson’s poetry 

about chasing the light helped me 
in realizing that happiness is not 
something that simply happens; it 
must be sought, even in the darkest 
of times. It has been arduous, 
but being patient is well worth 
it, because the clarity that comes 
with a healthy state of mind is 
exhilarating. Positivity is the best 
lens through which to view life. Of 
course, I still struggle with putting 
things into perspective sometimes 
and sadness strikes everybody, but 
now, I can finally say that I’m a 
happy girl and mean it.

I do not tell this story for 

attention or sympathy; I tell it 
because I see so many people 
around me dealing with similar 
struggles, and I pledged on a 
“Happy Acts” wall that I will 
share happiness by showing 
those people that life gets better. 
Sharing my testimonial is the 
best way I know how. If just one 
person reads this and decides 
to live another day — a day that 
could potentially offer a glimmer 
of hope or a hand of help — I’ll 
be happy. It’s so easy to tie one’s 
self-worth to things like school 
and develop tunnel vision as 
the semester hurtles toward 
its end with astonishing speed, 
but it’s best not to forget that 
life is beautiful and very much 
worth living, worth persevering 
in the midst of depression. It’s 
important to remember that there 
are a number of resources that 
Counseling and Psychological 
Services offers for those who 
are struggling — resources I 
would’ve loved to have access 
to as a high school junior — 
and 
that 
many 
university 

students 
experience 
feelings 

of inadequacy, depression or 
anxiety. You are never alone.

Perhaps 
my 
method 
of 

spreading happiness is not quite 
as affectionate as others’ — most 
of the responses on the board 
proclaimed 
that 
they 
would 

spread happiness by hugging 
more people, smiling at strangers 
and telling people that they are 
loved — but I believe that it is 
effective. After all, the clichéd 
saying that life gets better is a 
cliché because it’s true and offers 
hope. And hope is why I’m here 
today, the happiest I’ve been in a 
long time.

Seeking light in the darkness

ASHLEY ZHANG | COLUMN

ZHANG


Oh, how we love old stories: 

The fairytales, children’s books 
and movies of the past carry a 
fondness that we have developed 
towards 
these 
cherished 

characters, scenes, images and 
songs. I can vividly remember 
dance parties with my sisters, 
as my mom videotaped and 
the soundtrack of “The Lion 
King” played as we danced. 
I also recall our excitement 
toward watching “Cinderella,” 
“The Little Mermaid” and of 
course, “Beauty and the Beast.” 
I deemed Belle to be my favorite 
of the princesses, for I saw a 
resemblance of myself in her — 
namely her long brown hair and 
her love for books.

So here we are years later, 

remembering how much we 
adored these stories. We cannot 
keep them locked up in the past, 
nor do we desire to because 
little by little, they find their 
way back into our world. When 
they arrive, they come in many 

forms of adaptations — they 
have moved to Broadway or 
new films or even emerge in 
new literature. We then remind 
ourselves of the themes and 
lessons that fill these stories, 

and we are eager to enjoy them 
again.

We don’t just come across 

these “new” versions of beloved 
tales by accident. We rush to 
see the revivals or the remakes 
because we are so eager to 
consume what we love about 
the past.

We want to see what we once 

saw.

In his recent film review 

in 
Variety 
Magazine 
of 

“Beauty and the Beast,” Owen 
Gleiberman writes: “I keep 

comparing ‘Beauty and the 
Beast’ to the animated version, 
which raises a question: Is 
that what we’re supposed to be 
doing?”

I don’t know if we can really 

pinpoint any one way we’re 

supposed 
to 
be 
consuming 

art, but I do wonder about 
the question he poses. Do we 
approach these “remakes” to 
old stories with the expectation 
that they will mirror the stories 
we once loved? Or should we 
alter our expectations to accept 
the inevitable differences that 
come across the window of time 
between the old story and the 
creation of the new?

Gleiberman goes on to write: 

“We’re drawn in to see the old 
thing … but we want it to be 
new.”

We hope to find a way to 

recognize the changes when 
they come, while also hoping 
we can willingly greet them. 
We wish to “approve” this new 
form of characterization or 
added scene and accept that it 
is one more way to enhance the 
already wonderful story.

We 
consume 
art 
within 

a culture that is addicted 
to nostalgia. We look to old 

fairytales or movies, thinking 
about how we can recreate our 
first experience with it, how 
the new film, Broadway revival 
or adaptation reconstructs that 
old, or how I now sit in a movie 
theater 
watching 
the 
new 

“Beauty and the Beast,” and it 

makes me remember the five-
year-old girl who is dancing in 
the home videos. 

Rarely do I find anyone 

who prefers the remake to the 
original. We want something 
new from stories like “Beauty 

and the Beast,” “Cinderella” 
or “The Lion King,” but we 
also want to keep the feelings 
that were evoked from the 
original 
versions. 
When 

“The Lion King” moved to 
Broadway, I remember seeing 
it and still imagining that it 
was the film. It wasn’t that the 
Broadway version had reduced 
the brilliance of the film; it 
was just different. I think the 
differences are difficult to fully 
accept in exchange for what 
once was. 

There is a bit of danger that 

comes while seeking nostalgia, 
as we try to remake a feeling or 
a time that is long in the past. 
Though art can bring about 
its memory, it also reveals 
the striking reminder of the 
inherent impossibility of such 
recreation. Perhaps, the revival 
or remake of that once loved 
story reveals to you the changed 
nature of your own self — and 
it’s up to you to accept it.

‘Hotel Dallas’ conjures up 
Cold War era Americana 

COURTESY OF HOTEL DALLAS

“Hotel Dallas,” a fantasy-

laden documentary by Livia 
Ungur and Sherng-Lee Huang, 
is 
made 
for 
that 
strange 

intersection of Cold War buffs 
and fans of “Dallas,” 
an American soap 
opera 
about 
a 

wealthy Texan oil 
family 
that 
ran 

throughout 
the 

’80s. The show had 
been broadcast in 
state 
socialist-era 

Romania because its autocratic 
ruler, Nicolae Ceaucescu, had 
hoped to use its melodrama 
to propagandize the harms of 
capitalism. The plot backfired, 
as Romanians grew to watch the 
show in admiration; the wealth 
of the fictional Ewing family 
proved too tantalizing for state 
socialism’s restrictions and the 
wide viewership hastened the 
regime’s collapse.

Ungur 
and 
Huang’s 

documentary revisits Romania 
to explore how the TV series 
shaped the country’s fabric. 
Narrating 
and 
participating 

in much of the film is Ungur, 
a Romanian, alongside Patrick 
Duffy, who played Bobby Ewing 
(the 
righteous, 
handsome 

brother 
to 
ruthless 
baron 

J.R.) in the television show, 
though for a non-viewer of 
the show like myself, that fact 
isn’t entirely clear. As Duffy 
meanders through Romania, 
Ungur longs for an artists’ life 
in New York, while sporting 
the denim clothes and cowboy 
hat her viewership of “Dallas” 
has precipitated.

“Hotel Dallas” begins with 

a set tour of the show, noting 
that the rodeo ring built for 
the 
hundredth 
episode 
is 

only a third of the size of a 
standard one, but with wide 
anamorphic lenses, the space 
appears larger. This may be a 
determinative metaphor for the 
film — “Dallas” had an outsized 
impact on Romanian society in 
a way none of its producers or 
its American consumers could 
have 
ever 
imagined. 
After 

Ceaucescu was deposed in 1989, 
Romanian private enterprise 
exploded; many of its leaders 
adopted J.R. Ewing’s cowboy 
aesthetic to build credibility 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
Romanian 

customers. One such baron 
is a Mr. Ilie, “the Sunflower 
King of Slobozia,” who built a 

replica of the 
Ewing 
estate, 

Southfork, 
as well as a 
replica of the 
Eiffel 
Tower. 

It’s all a bit 
ridiculous, 
especially 

as Ilie, in his Kool-Aid red-
colored 
aviator 
sunglasses, 

sings an extended folk song to 
explain his riches.

Ungur and Huang also take 

care to recreate scenes from 
fictional and actual history 
(with children) — the television 
show’s 
famous 
sequences 

and 
Ceaucescu’s 
execution 

— to continue a trend that 
has been proliferating among 
recent 
documentaries. 
The 

reenactments join “The Look of 
Silence” and “The Wolfpack.” 
I’m 
not 
as 
convinced 
by 

the appeal of this brand of 
filmmaking. The reenactments 
are 
sometimes 
cute 
and 

sometimes strange, but never 
quite leave an impact that this 
TV show meant something 
to all Romanians, past and 
present, in a way a talking 
head interview would. That 
being said, some sequences are 
delightful to watch, including 
a reenacted scene in which 
Bobby dies and calls out, “Don’t 
move to the countryside. The 
future is rapid urbanization,” 
over a sorrowful requiem.

After about 30 minutes, the 

film begins to trail with a full-
throated discussion of space 
and time. The importance is 
clear: that “Dallas,” a uniquely 
American soap opera could 
have such meaning in a country 
like 
Romania 
and 
would 

foreshadow its transformation, 
is a clear example of this 
collapsing of space and time. But 
must it be literally debated and 
explained by dining Romanian 
philosophers? 
Or 
must 
we 

witness 
Ungur 
be 
placed 

inside a box by her mother, 
transporting bread to her 
cousin? These sequences seem 
pointless, and at the very least 
over the top. Still, an extended 
sequence as Ungur sits in the 
box, illuminated by a camera 
obscura telling the story of a 
New York artist remains one 
of the most stunning natural 
cinematic effects I’ve ever 

seen; Ungur looks to physically 
exist in the theater, her curled 
body seemingly popping off the 
screen.

Immediately preceding the 

film was a six-minute short 
film, 
“La 
Madra 
Buena,” 

directed by Sarah Clift. It 
was bright and fun, a brief 
tale of a mother searching 
far and wide to fulfill her 
son’s birthday wish: a Trump 
piñata. The film is incredibly 
timely, given the President’s 
calls for strict border security, 
especially with our southern 
neighbor, 
and 
contains 
a 

plethora of wonderful visual 
gags. It may not be a treat to 
everyone (though in an Ann 
Arbor theater crowd it received 
an 
overwhelmingly 
warm 

welcome), but the dreariness 
imparted by the pouring rain 
outside has no cure like good 
‘ole political bashing.

Remaking the original

‘The Encounter’ is where 
dreams and reality collide

COMPLICITE

He is speaking behind you. 

No, he is right next to you, 
whispering into your ear. No, 
he is standing directly in front 
of you, just a few inches away.

This Thursday, Friday and 

Saturday, UMS will present 
“The Encounter” at the Power 
Center, a show performed by 
Complicite company. The show 
is a unique performance that 
relies solely on audio.

Simon 
McBurney, 
the 

director 
and 
performer 
of 

the one-man show, uses a 
binaural microphone, which 
is a 3D audio technology that 
recreates audio as it is heard 
by the human ear instead of 
artificially splitting sound into 
right and left channels. The 
audience wears headphones 
during the entirety of the 
performance, 
and 
Simon 

speaking into the microphone 
is 
the 
only 
theatrical 

component to the show. 

“The microphone projects 

the direction of the sound, so 
to the audience, it could sound 
like he’s right behind them … 
or they could hear twigs in 
the jungle,” said Mallory Shea, 
UMS Marketing and Media 
Relations 
coordinator. 
“It 

really transports the audience 
into a different space and 
time.”

The 
performance 
follows 

the true story of National 
Geographic 
photographer 

Loren McIntyre in 1969. Loren 
got lost in a rainforest in 
Brazil and ended up spending 
time with the people of Javari 
Valley. 
Simon 
recreates 

Loren’s experience using the 
binaural microphone, delving 
deep into the limits of human 
consciousness.

“You don’t really feel like 

you’re in reality anymore,” 
Shea said. “Dreams and reality 
are going back and forth and 
in-between to the audience … 
it’s about the power of sound in 
forming imagination.”

The show is inspired by the 

book “Amazon Beaming” by 
Petru Popescu, which features 
McIntyre’s journey. From this 
starting point, Simon began 
brainstorming ideas to piece 
together the show. As part 
of this process, he traveled 
to 
Brazil, 
where 
he 
met 

descendants of the Mayoruna 
people, documenting his trip 
through a video diary. After 
this journey, Simon used his 
experiences to finish his work.

“The Encounter” ran for 

three months on Broadway, and 
it is set for its California debut 
in April and May after being 
performed in Ann Arbor. This 
is not the first performance 
Ann Arbor has experienced by 
McBurney, who has performed 
three other shows in the city 
since 2004.

“Simon loves coming back to 

Ann Arbor because he really 
believes 
in 
our 
audience’s 

ability 
to 
understand 
and 

grasp his work,” Shea said. 
“Our audiences have forward-
thinking people who are open 
to things that are different, 
and he really appreciates that 
about our audience. We still 
hear from people about how 
much they really loved the 
experience, more than 10 years 
later.”

Simon 
co-founded 
the 

show’s company, Complicite, 
in 1983. The company is based 
in London, and has played in 
over 40 countries across the 
world, winning over 50 awards 

for its productions.

Complicite is well-known 

for the extensive research and 
development that goes behind 
its productions. The company 
has also become famous for 

its distinctive stage language, 
which 
they 
develop 
using 

a combination of creativity 
with sound, lighting and video 
design. Complicite continues 
to 
experiment 
with 
new 

technology to bring compelling 
ideas to the stage.

“The Encounter” itself has 

won 
several 
awards 
since 

its debut in 2015, including 
the Herald Angel Award at 
the Edinburgh International 
Festival, The Evening Standard 
Award for Best Design, The 
Knights Illumination Award 
for Best Production and most 
recently, The Stage Award for 
Innovation.

in second-person perspective, 
making 
it 
a 
perfect 
mix 

between the postmodern Italo 
Calvino and the magical realist 
Gabriel Garcia Marquez. What 
at first seems like a fragmented 
mosaic of disparate lists is 
expertly weaved into a cohesive 
narrative that is simultaneously 
self-aware and poetic.

The film is centered on two 

travelers, Adela and Jorge. At 
first, the narration focuses 
on Adela’s perspective, but it 
shifts to Jorge as he relates his 
experiences in the fictional 
city 
of 
Emelina. 
Emelina 

looks 
like 
any 
other 
city; 

there are signs and parks and 
crosswalks and tall buildings. 
Yet, Emelina feels more like 
a lucid dream than a present 
reality. Jorge falls asleep one 
place and wakes up in another. 
Hernandez takes footage from 

urban and rural landscapes to 
create a fictional land from real 
places — a painterly spectacle 
of wanderlust and wistfulness.

The city is both familiar 

and foreign. Jorge, a character 

taken 
on 
by 

a 
number 

of 
actors 

throughout 
production 
, 

is lost within 
the clutches of 
Emelina. 
He 

finds 
himself 

only through exploration and 
interaction with the city, an 
expedition into the self as 
reflected by the overwhelming 
skyline of Emelina. Through 
Jorge’s 
eyes, 
Emelina 
is 

an 
unanswered 
question, 

therefore its existence remains 
a mystery to the audience. After 
Jorge’s description of Emelina, 
the narrator goes on to tell a 
sequence of events focused on 
what Jorge forgot to say about 
Emelina. This blatant self-
awareness is reminiscent of 
something out of the mind of 
Spike Jonze, turning even more 
meta with every frame.

While the film highlights 

the beauty of the journey, it 
also provides an insightful 
critique on urbanization and 
abuse of surveillance by the 
government. Emelina is both 
a paradise and a prison — to 
escape is harder than it seems.

Emelina 
communicates 

habitat 
in 
connection 
to 

humans in the 21st Century, not 
the clichéd 4th Grade science 
fair diorama with which we 

so often associate the word. 
Emelina’s habitat refers to the 
places we occupy, the spaces we 
find comfort in and the way we 
learn to define “home.”

“Emelina” 
is 
a 
visually 

stunning, innovative approach 
to storytelling through film. 
The film itself is bursting with 
creative energy and lyrical 
intrigue. Hernandez creatively 
captures 
the 
mystery 
of 

Emelina, leaving the audience 
craving more. “Emelina” feels 
like a dream within reality 
while offering a refreshing new 
take on the tasteful cocktail of 
fiction and fantasy.

Portugal. The Man show 
enthralls Detroit audience

ATLANTIC

It was hazy — in the good 

way. It was the type of hazy 
that 
masks 
certain 
sights 

under layers of lights and 
smushes certain sounds into 
a wall of indistinguishable 
goosebumps. The type of haze 
that acts as an overarching, 
sensory-activating 
blanket 

that primes a crowd to notice 
the 
details, 
subtleties 
and 

quirks that define a band, even 
if they don’t know every song 
on the setlist.

Portugal. 
The 
Man 
was 

engulfed 
in 
that 
haze 
on 

Saturday, as the band kept the 
sold-out crowd of Detroit’s 
Majestic Theater captivated 
for the entirety of the fog-
filled set. Body to body, from 
the front row to the bar in the 
back, the audience grooved 
along, 
varying 
pace 
and 

intensity with the band, jigging 
to playful opener “Creep in A 
T-Shirt,” pounding out angst to 
hit single “Hip Hop Kids.”

Throughout the show, lead 

singer 
and 
guitarist 
John 

Baldwin Gourley was stationed 
on the far left side of the 
stage, rather stagnant beneath 
the shadows of the stage 
lights, while bassist Zachary 
Carothers 
energetically 

commanded 
the 
right. 

Carothers acquired much of 
the crowd’s attention, taking 
shots and jumping around, 

even 
as 
Gourley’s 
falsetto 

propelled each song with his 
urgent but floating tone.

Behind the two frontmen, 

a giant LCD backdrop oozed 
psychedelic 
images, 
similar 

what you’d expect at a slightly-
creepy Tame Impala concert. At 
times it looked like a lava lamp 
— fluorescent, multicolored 
paint dripping down a wall in 

patterns that neglected the 
laws of gravity. Other times, 
these visuals flashed twirling, 
androgynous 
mannequins, 

interspersed with what looked 
like an intricate pinwheel of 

grey, blank corpses.

Introducing 
their 
most 

popular 
hits, 
the 
band 

cultivated hype by displaying 
the title on the screen, letting 
the 
crowd 
prepare 
itself 

just before. Three songs in, 
“Modern Jesus” fizzled onto 
the screen in turquoise block 
letters, while red and yellow 
paint strokes swirled in the 
background.

But 
there 
were 
striking 

moments in the haze too, 
particularly 
as 
the 
crowd 

gradually 
recognized 

Portugal’s instrumental cover 
of The Beatles’ “(I Want You) 
She’s So Heavy.” “Heavy” is 
truly the most accurate word to 
describe it, as three minutes of 
syncopated cymbal smashing, 
organ 
wailing 
and 
guitar 

screeching built to a warping 
crescendo.

The people just couldn’t get 

enough, loudly resisting after 
the group closed the show with 
their iconic “Purple Yellow 
Red and Blue.” Predictably, 
the audience stuck around, 
chanting for an encore. Their 
voices were heard as the band 
returned, 
perpetuating 
the 

electricity for just two more 
songs. Displaying remarkable 
endurance 
in 
delivering 

their signature edgy energy, 
Portugal. The Man lit up the 
Majestic Theatre; and their 
intoxicating haze lingered as 
fans flowed onto the moonlit 
sidewalks of Detroit after the 
amps unplugged.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

Riff Raff is apparently still 
attempting to do rap things, 
so to remind us all of his 
one-time relevance in the 
sphere of music, Jody High-
roller released the music 
video Tuesday for “Root 
Beer Float Ghost,” a single 
off January’s Aquaberry 
Aquarius.
Within the first 30 seconds 
of the video, its overtly 
introspective theme becomes 
clear. Each shot of the Hous-
ton-raised rapper shows him 
alone in a bathroom either 
facing a mirror or despon-
dently comforting himself.
Seemingly outdated warp-
like transitions direct our 
attention to Tommy Girl 
(real name: Tomi Dibiase), 
who belts a phony hook, one 
that definitely isn’t made 
better as the camera repeat-

edly focuses on her for a few 
seconds too long.
Still, comfortability (or a 

lack thereof) defines a video 
that can’t establish any 
semblance of it. Before Riff 
Raff talks up his “Attempt 
to stay sober with syrup in 
soda,” he’s spewing some-
thing about “Phoenix Suns, 
Scottsdale / I broke blocks at 
Harvard, shook dive at Yale.” 
He somehow keeps a straight 
face amid spitting something 
that many might have ini-
tially thought was a joke, and 

it’s all just a bit off.
Riff Raff built a (temporary) 
legend out of his virality. In 
past releases his character — 
which really isn’t a character 
— played as something of at 
least amusing entertainment 
value, resonating with the 
overly-ironic and overly-
branded masses because of 
it. Here, however, we get 
three minutes and 41 sec-
onds of confusion that really 
just falls short of everything, 
entertaining, somewhat 
serious or not. In title alone 
a single named “Root Beer 
Float Ghost” would’ve 
seemed to organically lend 
itself to an interesting novel-
ty of a music video. It didn’t.

BASEBALL

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Wolverines’ bats overpower Central Michigan

For 
a 
moment, 
the 
air 

evaporated from Ray Fisher 
Stadium. 
Fans 
stared 
at 

sophomore left-handed pitcher 
William Tribucher laying on the 
mound covering his face with 
his glove. A hard-hit line drive 
appeared to have ricocheted off 
his head. 

Fortunately, prior to hitting 

Tribucher in the chin, the ball 
was deflected by his shoulder 
and he was able to get up and 
finish off the last batter of the 
inning.

“He’s tough,” said Michigan 

coach Erik Bakich. “I didn’t 
know what I was going to see 
when I went out to the mound. 
I was expecting to see at least a 
little blood, but I saw no blood. 
He took it off the chin, got back 
up and said ‘I’m fine.’ ”

In two innings of relief, 

Tribucher allowed one unearned 
run on three hits.

Besides this scary instance, 

there was nothing but smiles for 
the No. 22 Michigan baseball 
team (1-2 Big Ten, 19-6 overall) 
in 
its 
13-4 
victory 
against 

Central Michigan (0-0 MAC, 
10-14 overall). The Wolverines’ 
offense accumulated 15 hits 
and scored 13 runs – the team’s 
second-highest 
run 
total 

of 
the 
season. 
Additionally, 

every starter reached base for 
Michigan.

“It’s just been (the team’s) 

approach,” 
said 
junior 
first 

baseman Jake Bivens on the 
team’s recent offensive surge. 
“Sticking to the plan and getting 
quality at-bats and that carries 
over to the next guy and the 
next guy. Everybody doing their 
job and trying to play in their 
comfort zone.”

The 
Wolverines 
had 
a 

complete 
team 
performance 

in which they put runs on the 
board early and often.

After producing a run in the 

first inning off a bloop single to 
center by junior third baseman 

Drew 
Lugbauer, 
Michigan’s 

offense exploded with four runs 
in the second.

The 
Wolverines 
quickly 

loaded the bases after senior 
catcher Harrison Wenson was 
hit by a pitch, 
an infield single 
legged 
out 
by 

sophomore right 
fielder Jonathan 
Engelmann 
and sophomore 
second baseman 
Ako 
Thomas 

singled to right.

In 
the 

following at-bat, 
with 
senior 

centerfielder 
Johnny Slater up 
to the plate, Central Michigan 
catcher Blake Cleveland gave up 
a passed ball – allowing Wenson 
to score. In the same at-bat, 
Slater blasted an RBI triple to 
right that narrowly stayed in the 
ballpark – he leads the team with 

four triples on the season. After 
an error from Chippewa first 
baseman Evan Kratt allowed 
another run to score, Michigan 
led 5-0. 

Upon adding an additional run 

in the fifth off an 
error by Central 
Michigan 
shortstop 
Alex 

Borglin, 
the 

Wolverines’ 
offense 
again 

erupted in the 
seventh.

An 
inning 

that 
featured 

seven runs was 
highlighted 
by 

a monster two-
run 
homerun 

by Lugbauer. The ball sailed 
over the right fielder’s head, 
out of the stadium and over the 
neighboring indoor track and 
field facility.

Bakich credits his team’s 

recent offensive firepower to 

“quality at-bats” in which guys 
are fighting off pitches and 
working the count.

While Michigan’s offense was 

on a tear, the team’s pitching 
was also impressive – allowing 
only one earned run.

Despite a successful outing 

from the game’s starter Alec 
Rennard – in which he allowed 
no walks, no runs and three 
hits on just 47 pitches – Bakich 
pulled the junior right-hander 
after just four innings. The 
decision was made in order to 
make Rennard available either 
Saturday or Sunday against 
Penn State.

Heading into their first Big 

Ten home series of the season, 
the Wolverines are coming off 
three straight wins, in which 
they 
have 
outscored 
their 

opponents by 25 runs. This 
type of run differential should 
give Michigan the confidence 
it needed as it goes into its 
upcoming weekend series. 

CLAIRE MEINGAST/Daily

Junior right-hander Alec Rennard pitched four scoreless innings against Central Michigan in the Wolverines’ victory.

Versatility proves
X factor in ‘M’ win

Senior centerfielder Johnny 

Slater stepped up to the plate in the 
second inning with two runners 
on base. Slater had been moved 
to the ‘2’ spot in the batting order 
and in his second at-bat of the 
game, he launched a ball deep into 
the outfield for a triple, sending 
leadoff hitter and sophomore 
second baseman Ako Thomas and 
sophomore right fielder Jonathan 
Engelmann home. 

The No. 22 Michigan baseball 

team routed Central Michigan, 
13-4. The win comes a day after 
the Wolverines shut out another 
MAC team, Toledo, 12-0.

The offensive surge for the 

team is a new development as 
over the course of the 24-game 
season so far, it has recorded 223 
hits and 152 runs.

The success of the team over 

the past weeks raises some 
questions: What could be the X 
factor? How is Michigan going 
into its long home stretch on such 
a hot streak?

One of the answers is its 

versatility. In the game against 
the Chippewas on Wednesday, 
the Wolverines switched up 
their batting order to gain a 
competitive edge over their foe.

Among the notable changes 

were Slater moving up to hit 
second and junior third baseman 
Jake Bivens moving to hit sixth in 
the order.

And clearly, it worked.
“(I) just wanted to get Slater 

up, (more at-bats),” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “He’s got a lot 
of confidence and hitting a lot of 
balls hard.”

Slater produced a multi-RBI 

triple, and Bivens dropped two 
singles and picked up a run. 

“I try not to change my 

approach too much, honestly,” 
Bivens said of moving to sixth. “I 

know I have good guys in front 
of me and they’re going to get on 
base, so I just try to drive them in 
and do my job.”

One 
thing 
that 
Bakich 

emphasized throughout the season 
has been committing to quality 
at-bats, no matter the outcome. 

“We had 30 quality at-bats 

yesterday and 31 quality at-bats 
today,” Bakich said. “… Obviously, 
everyone looks at batting average 
and 
slugging 
and 
on-base, 

but we look at quality at-bat 
percentages.”

This versatility was evident in 

the latter innings of Wednesday’s 
game as Bakich made several 
substitutions. Sophomore first 
baseman Jimmy Kerr entered 
the game for Bivens and redshirt 
freshman 
designated 
hitter 

George Hewitt entered the game, 
both producing hits.

“If you go in our indoor cages 

you’ll see a weekly winner for 
highest quality at-bat percentage 
guy,” Bakich said. “We just 
want to look at who has the 
most 
productive 
team 
plate 

appearances, who’s hitting the 
ball hard, who’s having the most 
competitive ABs.”

This 
top-down 
approach 

to creating a culture in which 
quality at-bats are king is one of 
the reasons why the team can 
switch around the lineup so 
easily and explains the recent 
success.

The outlook from the game 

against Central Michigan is that 
the Wolverines are a versatile 
team that have a multitude of 
players who can hit anywhere in 
the lineup. 

As quality at-bats are the 

hot commodity in the locker 
room and on the field, the game 
against the Chippewas put that 
on display. Michigan takes an 
approach to the game that quality 
at-bat 
percentage 
should 
be 

another column on the stat sheet.

Struggles at the plate continue for ‘M’

Players were crossing the plate 

like pedestrians at a turnstile in a 
New York subway station. 

Eleven different players had 

hits and eight had tallied RBIs — 
including the first career hit for 
freshman catcher Abby Skvarce 
and first RBIs for freshman 
shortstop Madison Uden. 

After five innings Sunday, the 

game against Penn State came to 
a merciful ending, with a crooked 
number on the scoreboard (17) 
and a ubiquitous sense of relief 
permeating the team. 

But Michigan coach Carol 

Hutchins still kept her guard up. 
She wasn’t ready to declare the 
“tightness” that she believed to 
have been plaguing the offense all 
year a thing of the past.

“We’ll see,” Hutchins said. 

“Certainly in a game like that, 
when you jump on them and 
you’re up by five, you’re not tight. 
And when you’re not tight, you do 
play better… you’re going to face a 
lot of good pitchers. Good pitching 

in softball means you have to 
persevere until you get some 
timely hits.”

The offensive renaissance was 

much-needed for a team that has 
struggled mightily at times this 
season, but the blowout and sweep 
against a team it has traditionally 
dominated — with this being the 
28th straight victory over the 
Nittany Lions — didn’t mar the 
inconsistencies that have plagued 
the Michigan offense.

The win didn’t change one 

troubling fact: the Wolverines’ 
offense has struggled against the 
top-quality pitching it has faced 
this season.

Michigan 
has 
faced 
eight 

starting pitchers this season with 
an earned-run average below 
2.00. In those games, the team has 
averaged just 1.625 runs, including 
three 
shutouts. 
The 
problem 

is made more apparent by the 
Wolverines’ current 2-6-1 record 
against ranked opponents.

On 
Tuesday 
against 
an 

overmatched Central Michigan 
team, Chippewa pitcher Rachael 
Knapp — who has a 1.66 ERA — 

held Michigan’s offense down. 
Knapp surrendered just two runs 
on the day, keeping the game 
competitive.

Hutchins thinks the offensive 

disparity stems from more than 
just physical difficulties.

“We’ve got a lot of kids who can 

really swing bats, we have some 
kids that can swing well, and when 
we’re on we’re all on — we’re very 
contagious,” Hutchins said. 

“And when we’re off we’re all 

off. So in my mind (the struggles) 
are from the neck up. We need to 
get a little bit tougher, we need to 
get feisty and fight. We’re going 
to have to fight for what we want, 
and to be a good offense they’re 
going to have to fight to be a good 
offense.”

To some extent, these struggles 

are to be expected; good pitchers 
are harder to score against. But 
they also shed some light on the 
room for improvement that still 
exists. For a team that will need 
to beat good pitching in the Big 
Ten and NCAA Tournaments if it 
hopes to accomplish its goals, its 
success will largely be predicated 

on improvement in that area.

No. 
6 
Minnesota 
— 
the 

Wolverines’ prime competition 
in 
the 
uncharacteristically 

competitive Big Ten — carries 
one of the best pitchers in the 
country in right-hander Sara 
Groenewegen. The senior boasts 
a 0.57 ERA in her 85 innings this 
season.

No. 22 Wisconsin will also be 

a potential foe in the Big Ten this 
season. They have a duo of starters 
with ERAs below 1.50.

No. 2 Florida — the team that 

has served as the primary thorn in 
Michigan’s post-season side — has 
a tandem of dominant pitchers, 
including Kelly Barnhill, who 
already shut the Wolverine lineup 
down in a 2-1 defeat earlier this 
season.

The list could, and will, go on.
The Michigan softball team 

has its anchor atop the rotation — 
senior Megan Betsa will always 
be the backbone of this team. But 
if it continues to struggle against 
quality pitching, Michigan will 
have troubles when it matters 
most.

Rebounding guides 
Michigan past Nova

Normally, if the Michigan 

women’s basketball team shot 
just 26 percent from behind the 
arc, the Wolverines would be in 
trouble. 

Wednesday night was not the 

case of normal circumstances, 
as Michigan still topped the 
Wildcats, 65-61, and advanced to 
its first ever WNIT championship 
game. The Wolverines can thank 
their performance on the glass 
for their victory, as they out-
rebounded Villanova, 40-33.

“(Rebounding) was something 

we spent a lot 
of time talking 
about,” 
said 

Michigan 
coach 
Kim 

Barnes 
Arico. 

“We needed to 
give 
ourselves 

second-chance 
points. 
We 

thought we could 
have 
an 
edge 

on the offensive 
glass, and we really tried to have 
our team crash. Given our team’s 
second-chance opportunities, we 
didn’t have to defend through the 
entire shot clock.”

The 
rebounding 
disparity 

between the two teams was most 
notable on offense, as Michigan 
nabbed 
10 
offensive 
boards 

to the Wildcats’ three. The 
Wolverines outscored Villanova 
in the paint, 34-14, and scored 10 
second-chance points while not 
surrendering a single such point 
to the Wildcats.

In the last three minutes of the 

third quarter, Michigan nabbed 
three offensive boards — two by 
sophomore center Hallie Thome 
and one by sophomore guard 
Nicole Munger. Thome scored 
six 
second-chance 
points 
in 

that stretch, including a buzzer-
beating layup that gave the 
Wolverines a 52-38 edge.

“I know that my teammates 

are going to put me in the right 
position to score,” Thome said. 

“If they’re not passing me the 
ball that means they’re packing 
the paint. We have a good enough 
team where other people can step 
up.”

It was defensive rebounding, 

though, that proved critical in the 
waning moments of the contest. 
With 
32 
seconds 
remaining, 

Villanova had cut what was a 
52-36 Michigan lead into just a 
five-point deficit. The Wildcats 
had made seven of their last nine 
shots and looked poised to make it 
a one possession game.

But Villanova guard Adriana 

Hahn missed a 2-point jumper, 
and 
junior 
forward 
Jillian 

Dunston 
pulled 

down a rebound. 
Dunston 
then 

found 
senior 

guard 
Siera 

Thompson, who 
quickly drew a 
foul and made 
one free throw, 
stalling 
the 

Wildcats’ 
late 

momentum.

“We work on 

rebounding every day,” Dunston 
said. “I think we knew that they 
were a bigger team than us, so 
rebounding was a big thing for 
us.”

The Wolverines’ next opponent 

— Georgia Tech — knows a thing 
or two about winning with boards. 
Despite shooting just 18 percent 
from long range, the Yellow 
Jackets 
defeated 
Washington 

State, 69-61, in large part because 
they out-rebounded the Cougars, 
50-35.

And indeed, winning the battle 

on the glass was key to Michigan’s 
92-52 win over Georgia Tech 
on Dec. 1. The Wolverines out-
rebounded the Yellow Jackets, 
44-38 and nabbed 29 defensive 
boards to Georgia Tech’s 15. If 
Michigan can repeat that success 
against the Yellow Jackets, the 
Wolverines will have an excellent 
chance to win their first ever 
WNIT championship and raise a 
banner in Crisler Center for the 
first time.

Wolverines defeat Villanova, 65-61, advance to finals of Women’s National Invitation Tournament

“Woo-whee!”
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 

Arico has said it many times in 
postgame interviews this season, 
but none of those instances had the 
bravado like the exclamation she 
made when she entered the media 
room Wednesday night.

It was the emotion of a coach 

whose team has been put through 
the wringer, but is inches from 
getting a taste of salvation.

The Wolverines’ WNIT semifinal 

matchup against Villanova was 
perhaps the most significant game 
in Michigan women’s basketball 
history, and the Wolverines made 
it look like clockwork to advance to 
their first WNIT title game.

The contest wasn’t without its 

hiccups. Up 15 at one point in the 
final quarter, Michigan saw its 
margin dwindle to as little as four, 
but Barnes Arico’s team willed its 
way to maintain a 65-61 victory. 
At the final buzzer, the team was 
hopping and skipping in jubilation 
before it waved to the crowd and 
entered the tunnel.

Regardless of what happens 

in the Wolverines’ championship 
matchup Saturday, they have had 
their best season in program history, 
and are riding the momentum of 
their biggest win to date. But even 
if you were at Crisler Center on 
Wednesday, you would hardly know 
just how important it was for them 
to get over a hump that has halted 
them in the past.

Michigan has fallen short the 

previous two seasons in the WNIT 
semifinals, with losses to UCLA and 
Florida Gulf Coast. Disappointment 
is something that has been all too 
familiar for the Wolverines this 
season — headlined by missing out 
on the NCAA Tournament — but as 
junior forward Jillian Dunston put 
it, “determination” trumped nerves 
to overcome the semifinals hurdle.

“It was absolutely incredible,” 

Barnes 
Arico 
said. 
“For 
the 

disappointment 
that 
we 
have 

gone through, and for our kids 
to rally and get past the game 
and the opportunity to play in a 
championship game — It’s really 
special.”

Determination 
and 

disappointment beget the litany 
of goals that Michigan has sought 
since the March 13 selection show: 
proving 
the 
NCAA 
selection 

committee 
wrong, 
and 
most 

importantly, winning for the seniors.

“The NCAA selection committee 

made a mistake,” Barnes Arico said. 
“We thought that on the night of the 
selection show and hopefully we are 
showing them that they did.

“Our team has rallied behind 

(senior guards Danielle Williams 
and Siera Thompson). They have 
raised the level of their game 
another notch. They’re going out 
with everything they have. One 
more day, one more opportunity to 
put on that Michigan uniform. … It’s 
really special for our seniors and it’s 
special for our whole program. Each 
year they’ve been able to do things 
that haven’t been accomplished the 
year before.”

On Saturday, the Wolverines will 

face a familiar opponent in Georgia 
Tech — who they beat on the road by 
40 points on Dec. 1 — in unfamiliar 
championship territory. History 
tells us that Michigan will have no 
trouble against the Yellow Jackets, 
and if the Wolverines do become 
WNIT champions, then they could 
look ahead to next season having 
written a new chapter of history.

“If you look around Crisler there 

is not one (banner) in there for 
women’s basketball. And that has 
been one of our goals,” Barnes Arico 
said. “To all our alumni, to anyone 
who’s been involved in our program, 
for them to walk into Crisler and see 
a banner for women’s basketball’s 
success would just be a special 
moment for our entire program.”

Senior 
guards 
Danielle 

Williams and Sierra Thompson, 
junior guards Jillian Dunston and 
Katelynn Flaherty and sophomore 
center Hallie Thome walked onto 
the court before tip-off, ready to 
push through a barrier that the 
Wolverines have faced before: 
the Women’s National Invitation 
Tournament semifinals. 

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team (11-5 Big Ten, 26-9 
overall) was in this exact position 
a year ago — and the year before 
that — making this the third-
straight attempt 
at crossing over 
into the finals of 
the WNIT. 

And 
finally, 

this year, they 
did 
just 
that 

— 
beating 

Villanova, 65-61. 

“This 
is 

the third time 
we’ve been in 
the final four,” 
Dunston 
said. 

“So (the mentality) was more of 
determination than nervousness. 

“It feels awesome. We felt 

like we’ve come so far, just to 
do the same thing again. It feels 
great what we actually got to 
accomplish. But we’re not done 
yet.” 

The Wolverines hosted the 

Wildcats (11-7 Big East, 20-14 
overall) at Crisler Center for 
the semifinal of the WNIT on 
Wednesday, where Michigan has 
gone 19-1 on the season.

In the first quarter, with a little 

over five minutes to go, the score 
stood locked at seven. Thompson 
had managed a 3-pointer and 
Thome and Flaherty had both 
secured layups. After bringing 
the ball downcourt, Thome stood 
underneath the basket struggling 

against a pair of Villanova post 
players — a position she typically 
finds herself in. Dunston swooped 
in and grabbed the ball from her 
teammate’s hands and quickly 
extended up, easily placing the ball 
in the hoop. 

“It’s 
definitely 
frustrating,” 

Thome said, who finished with 
a team-high 22 points. “But I 
know my teammates are going 
to put me in a position to score, 
and if they’re not passing the ball, 
they’re packing the paint. I just got 
to trust my other teammates, like 
(Dunston).”

With 1:30 left to go in the 

opening quarter, Michigan was 

frustrated 
with 

the 
back-and-

forth 
nature 
of 

play 
— 
neither 

team 
ever 
held 

more than a two-
point 
advantage 

— 
but 
Flaherty 

changed that by 
stepping back and 
burying a deep 
three, pushing her 
team to a four-
point lead. 

To finish out the quarter, the 

Wolverines were having trouble 
creating space in the paint. With 
time ticking down and only one 
second left, Dunston again made 
a play for Michigan and took a 
jumpshot from the right of the 
post, beating the buzzer. The 
game entered the second quarter, 
17-11. 

The 
Wildcats 
responded 

with quick threes by guards 
Alex 
Louin 
and 
Adrianna 

Hahn. The duo was expected to 
make impressive 3-point shots 
entering the matchup, as it makes 
up the majority of the team’s 
backcourt. Freshman guard Kysre 
Gondrezick could have assisted in 
staving the duo off, but was still 
absent due to personal reasons. 

Heading 
into 
halftime, 

Michigan and Villanova had each 
attempted 28 field goals, but the 
Wolverines held the slight edge 
— going 11-for-28 to the Wildcats’ 
10-for-28. 

The second half started off with 

back-to-back deep 3-pointers by 
Villanova’s Hahn, tying the score 
at 32-32. In response, Michigan 
quickly posted six points, two 
each from Flaherty, Dunston and 
Thome. 

Similar to Dunston’s buzzer-

beater a period before, Thome 
managed a quick bucket just before 
the third quarter ended. The play 
left the Wolverines up, 48-36, after 
a quiet buildup of breakaway point 
accumulation. 
Michigan 
had 

held the Wildcats 
to 
four 
total 

points 
in 
the 

quarter, while the 
Wolverines went 
on a 16-point run. 

“(Michigan 

coach 
Barnes 

Arico) just told 
us to have fun,” 
Dunston 
said. 

“She said, ‘You got 
to do it now more than ever; there’s 
20 minutes left,’ and that hit us all 
pretty hard.” 

Villanova 
didn’t 
give 
up, 

though, and went on a 10-0 run 
in a 1:44 span within the first half 
of the final quarter. Michigan 
had given up its 15-point lead and 
was left leading by just five. The 
momentum was threatening to 
turn the into an awful reminder of 
its previous semifinal contests. 

But Barnes Arico called a time 

out with 5:23 left between her and 
a possible WNIT Championship 
appearance. 

The atmosphere at Crisler 

was tense. Nobody was ready to 
witness the third-straight year of 
Wolverine devastation. Nobody 
wanted 
to 
miss 
Michigan’s 

opportunity to show the NCAA 

Tournament selection committee 
exactly what its snub meant to the 
Wolverines. 

“I think the NCAA selection 

committee 
made 
a 
mistake,” 

Barnes Arico said. “Hopefully we 
are showing them that they did.” 

The rallying cry that the 

Wolverines 
have 
made 
their 

mantra is to do it for their seniors, 
Thompson and Williams. The 
latter, who has been referred to 
as the “mom” of the team even 
though she has not seen the 
minutes that Thompson has, made 
an impact on the defensive end of 
the game with some key rebounds.

“(Williams) has worked her butt 

off,” Thome said. 
“So, it’s definitely 
exciting to see … 
(she) has always 
put the team first, 
and is one of the 
best 
teammates 

you 
can 
have. 

To see all of her 
hard work pay 
off, and to see her 
able to play these 
minutes is just 
really exciting. 

“It’s 
a 
great 
moment 
for 

Danielle, and I’m very proud of 
her.” 

The final minutes of the game 

were 
touch-and-go, 
eventually 

leaving Michigan in the bonus. 
Thompson went 1-for-2 on her free 
throws, giving the Wolverines a 
63-57 lead with 23.5 seconds left. 
Then she repeated the process, 
putting Michigan up, 64-61, with 
11.1 seconds left. 

Flaherty took the next bonus. 

She swished the first, but missed 
the second. It was 65-61 with 
seven seconds remaining. 

Finally, a collective breath was 

let out by the crowd. Villanova 
couldn’t overcome the gap. 

The 
clock 
hit 
zero. 
The 

Wolverines had finally done it. 
Michigan was in the WNIT finals.
