CELEBRATING OUR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Panel explores 
connections 

between health and 

social justice

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

Agriculture, food access, race 

and social justice were all topics 
of conversation during a panel 

discussion held Monday to kick 
off the University’s first-ever 
Detroit Week.

Detroit Week examines a vari-

ety of barriers in the city, includ-
ing racism and poverty and 
encourage community service in 
the city, according to Public Poli-
cy junior Blair Sucher, education 
chair of the Detroit Partnership 
and recruitment coordinator for 
the Semester in Detroit.

Several student groups includ-

ing the Detroit Partnership, the 

Black Student Union, Black Vol-
unteer Network, Semester in 
Detroit and LSA Student Gov-
ernment sponsor Detroit Week, 
with features two more Detroit-
focused events scheduled for 
Wednesday and Saturday.

Titled the “Race and Food 

Justice Panel,” Monday’s lecture 
examined food and agriculture 
in terms of their historical and 
current impacts on the city. The 
lecture also explored how food 
helped shaped present racial 

relationships within the city.

The 
panel 
included 
local 

activist Oya Amakisi; Kami 
Pothukuchi, professor of Urban 
Studies at Wayne State Univer-
sity; and Anthony Hatinger, gar-
den production coordinator for 
the Central Detroit Christian 
Community Development Cor-
poration.

Sucher said the panel aimed 

to look at social justice from a 
unique lens and to push stu-

Guidelines to 

simplify current 
policy for student 
responsibilities

By TANAZ AHMED

Daily Staff Reporter

Central Student Government 

has commissioned a task force 
to establish a University-wide 
student honor code. The code 
would stand in addition to the 
pre-existing Statement of Stu-
dent Rights and Responsibilities 
— a set of standards to which 
students agree to adhere by 
upon accepting admission to the 
University. 

Established by CSG President 

Bobby Dishell, a Public Policy 
senior, the task force is designed 
to create an honor code covering 
academic integrity, individual 
behavior and student rights.

“The aim of the task force, 

and eventually the honor code, 
will be to encourage and moti-
vate students to hold ourselves 

to a higher standard,” Dishell 
wrote in a press release. “Cur-
rently there is not one place 
where students can turn to in 
order to know what our commu-
nity stands for. It’s important 
that, as students at Michigan, 
we understand our roles as the 
leaders and best both on and off 
campus.”

In an interview with The 

Michigan 
Daily, 
CSG 
Vice 

President Emily Lustig, an LSA 
senior and chair of the task-
force, said the University lacks 
a clear, institution-wide honor 
code.

“Only certain colleges or 

schools within the University 
have honor codes and they are 
adhered to at different levels,” 
she said.

The Statement acknowledges 

this decentralization, noting 
that numerous entities have 
individual conduct policies and 
mechanisms for sanctioning for 
violations of standards. In addi-
tion, Lustig said, the Statement 
is sometimes too long to be com-
prehensive. Lustig said short-

Body discusses 
Fitness for Duty 

policy during 

executive session

By CARLY NOAH

Daily Staff Reporter

At their weekly meeting 

Monday afternoon, the Senate 
Advisory Committee on Uni-
versity Affairs discussed the 
reorganization of several Senate 
Assembly committees.

SACUA also reviewed proce-

dures related to the University’s 
Office for Institutional Equity 
and the Fitness for Duty and 
Professional Standards for Fac-
ulty. Both were discussed dur-
ing a private executive session, 
which are not open to the public 
or the press.

The Fitness for Duty policy 

offers protocals for situations 

when faculty are deemed physi-
cally or mentally unable to 
perform their jobs. The policy 
provides for the possibility of 
financial 
compensation 
dur-

ing a University investigation 
of competency and one year of 
severance pay if their employ-
ment is terminated due to their 
condition.

Last year, SACUA considered 

revisions the policy to mediate 
conflicts between provisions of 
the Americans with Disabilities 
Act and the University’s current 
policy.

The ADA does not require 

faculty state the reason they 
are unable to perform their job. 
SACUA concluded that the Uni-
versity could rework the lan-
guage of the policy to make that 
provision explicitly applicable 
to faculty with physical or men-
tal illness.

The committee also dis-

cussed restructuring the body’s 
committees 
to 
reduce 
the 

number of committees under 
SACUA.

“We’re looking to economize 

SACUA,” said SACUA Chair 
Scott Masten, a professor in 
Public Policy and Business Eco-
nomics.

He said the meeting did not 

finalize any decision, but deter-
mined what matters would be 
taken up in the next Senate 
Assembly meeting.

For example, a merger of the 

Tenure Committee with the 
Rules Committee was suggest-
ed during the meeting.

The Rules Committee cur-

rently works with bylaw chang-
es within the Senate Assembly. 
It was recommended that the 
Rules Committee be granted 
the responsibilities of looking 
at University Standard Practice 
Guides and technology infor-
mation before proposals are 
sent to SACUA.

Analysis shows 
existing studies 
employ imperfect 

methods

By SAMIHA MATIN

For the Daily

Though expanding biofuel 

production is often lauded as 
a key strategy for decreasing 
carbon emissions, a University-
based analysis found that the 
benefits might not be so exten-
sive.

John DeCicco, a research 

professor at the University’s 
Energy 
Institute, 
reviewed 

existing studies that evaluated 
the effectiveness of biofuel as 
an alternative energy source. He 
discovered that the variety of 
computer models used does not 
accurately represent the amount 
of carbon dioxide absorbed from 
the atmosphere when biofuels 
are produced.

Though biofuel, an energy 

source composed from organic 
or food waste products, has gen-
erally been deemed a leading 
eco-friendly option for reducing 
gasoline consumption, DeCicco 
said many of the studies are mis-
leading.

“The government has spon-

sored computer models which 
have made a very basic account-
ing mistake,” he said. “Particu-
larly, they count carbon dioxide 
uptake as it happens. They com-
pletely offset the carbon dioxide 
admitted when the biofuel is 

burned.”

In recent years, scientists and 

researchers have debated the 
advantages and disadvantages 
of biofuel compared to petro-
leum production.

DeCicco, 
however, 
said 

his work takes a step back to 
research fundamental mistakes 
made when measuring carbon 
dioxide uptake throughout the 
decades. His research argues 
against the assumption that bio-
fuels decrease net carbon diox-
ide emissions.

Using a field of soybeans as an 

example, DeCicco talked about 
how these models fail to recog-
nize that lands are constantly 
being 
used 
for 
production. 

Fields previously used to grow 
food are now providing for bio-
fuel production.

“The 
computer-analysis 

methods forget to check what 
land is doing before it is used to 
grow soybeans for biofuels,” he 
said. “They think that the land is 
completely barren. That’s a very 
big mistake.”

Consequently, there has been 

no increase in the removal of 
carbon dioxide from the atmo-
sphere as a result of increased 
biofuel production because the 
fields were already being used to 
grow food.

The research paper also high-

lights the use of carbon foot-
print models and their incorrect 
calculations that carbon diox-
ide emissions are lower with 
biodiesel than petroleum. The 
results are inconsistent with 
the realities of the carbon cycle, 

Despite CDC 

recomendations, 
doctors continue to 
prescribe antibiotics

By PARISHA NOVA

Daily Staff Reporter

Researchers from the Uni-

versity, the London School of 
Hygiene and Tropical Medicine 
and the University of Alabama 
have found that Oseltamivir — 
an antiviral medicine marketed 
as “Tamiflu” — shortens the 
duration of influenza symp-
toms by about a day.

When treated with Tamiflu, 

researchers observed a 44 per-
cent reduction in the develop-
ment of respiratory infections 
or other infectious complica-
tions.

Epidemiology Prof. Arnold 

Monto, a researcher from the 
School of Public Health, said 
the study confirms the success 
of antiviral medication in treat-
ing the flu.

“We decided to conduct this 

study as antibacterials are often 
prescribed on grounds that 
antivirals are not as effective,” 
Monto said.

Antivirals typically inhibit 

the development of pathogens, 
whereas 
antibacterial 
treat-

ments kill bacteria.

Monto added that despite 

the recommendations from the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention to use of Tamiflu for 
treating influenza, doctors tend

Negotiations with bailout 
creditors move forward

In Greece, prime 
minister pledges to 
reach compromise

ATHENS, Greece (AP) — 

Greece put a brave face on 
its fraught negotiations with 
European 
bailout 
creditors, 

with the new prime minis-
ter voicing confidence Mon-
day that a compromise can be 
reached at high-stakes meet-
ings in coming days.

Alexis 
Tsipras’ 
comments 

came as Greek stocks and bonds 
took a drubbing after the radical 
left-led government renewed a 
pledge to seek bailout debt for-
giveness and dubbed the coun-
try’s rescue package — with its 
conditions of strict austerity — a 
“toxic fantasy.”

“I don’t believe there is a seri-

ous reason for there not to be 
an agreement ... with our part-

ners — just political reasons,” 
Tsipras said after a meeting in 
Vienna with Austrian Chancel-
lor Werner Faymann.

“If we are brought to an 

impasse due to such politi-
cal reasons, then I think that 
would be a decision to torpedo 
our common European future,” 
Tsipras added. “And I think 
nobody harbors such inten-
tions.”

Tsipras’ 
government 
won 

Jan. 25 elections promising 
relief for Greeks who have 
suffered through six years of 
recession and a dramatic drop 
in living standards. It’s under 
intense pressure to work out a 
deal with bailout creditors in 
coming weeks or days, which 
would unlock funds and secure 
cheap 
financing 
for 
Greek 

banks — five of which suffered 
a one-notch downgrade Mon-
day by Moody’s ratings agency.

In the radical left Syriza 

party’s first week in power, 
Greece has suffered a ratings 
downgrade and a decision by 
the European Central Bank not 
to accept its bonds as collateral 
for credit to Greek lenders. A 
flurry of visits to key Euro-
pean partners earned Tsipras’ 
government little more than 
expressions of sympathy.

Greece faces a grilling at an 

emergency meeting of euro-
zone 
finance 
ministers 
in 

Brussels on Wednesday, with 
fears of a chaotic currency exit 
returning.

German Chancellor Angela 

Merkel said Monday that Ber-
lin wants Greece to stay in the 
eurozone, but any agreement 
must be based on existing bail-
out commitments.

“I think what counts is what 

Greece will put on the table at 
(Wednesday’s) meeting or per-
haps a few days later,” she said 
after talks in Washington with 
President Barack Obama. “I’ve 
always said I would wait for 
Greece to come with a sustain-
able proposal and then we’ll 
talk about this.”

Tsipras’ government, which 

ousted the less-confrontation-
al conservatives, argues that 
Greece’s 320 billion euro ($360 
billion) debt will be increas-
ingly unsustainable unless it 
receives generous repayment 
relief that would allow its bat-
tered economy to recover.

Finance 
Minister 
Yanis 

Varoufakis dismissed the 240 
billion 
euro 
($270 
billion) 

bailout packages crafted by 
Greece’s lenders after the coun-
try nearly went bust in 2010 as a 
“toxic fantasy” that had always 
been doomed to fail.

“The time has come to say 

what officials admit when the 
microphones are turned off and 
say out in the open. ... At some 
point someone has to say ‘No’ 
and that role has fallen to us, 
little Greece,” he told parlia-
ment.

Justice Thomas objects to 
ruling on gay marraiges

Dissent criticizes 
Supreme Court 
for overlooking 

state laws

(AP) — The Supreme Court 

is 
inappropriately 
signaling 

it intends to clear the way 
for gay marriage across the 
nation, 
Justice 
Clarence 

Thomas complained Monday 
in a stinging dissent to the 
court’s refusal to block the 
start of same-sex marriages in 
Alabama.

Bitterly objecting to Monday’s 

action, 
Thomas 
provided 
a 

rare insider’s perspective on 
the widely held view that the 
court’s embrace of gay marriage 
is a done deal.

Thomas filed a dissenting 

opinion after his colleagues 
rejected Alabama’s plea to put 
a hold on same-sex marriages 
in the state until the Supreme 
Court 
resolves 
the 
issue 

nationwide in a few months.

He 
criticized 
his 
fellow 

justices for looking “the other 
way as yet another federal 
district judge casts aside state 
laws,” rather than following 

the customary course of leaving 
those laws in place until the 
court answers an important 
constitutional question.

“This 
acquiescence 
may 

well be seen as a signal of the 
court’s intended resolution of 
that question,” Thomas wrote 
in an opinion that was joined 
by Justice Antonin Scalia. “This 
is not the proper way” for the 
court to carry out its role under 
the Constitution, he wrote, 
“and, it is indecorous for this 
court to pretend that it is.”

The opinion was remarkable 

less for the legal result it 
suggested than for its open 
criticism of fellow justices.

After 
all, 
many 
legal 

commentators have predicted 
not only the case’s outcome this 
spring (in favor of same-sex 
marriage), but the vote (5-4) 
and the author of the majority 
opinion 
(Justice 
Anthony 

Kennedy).

The number of states in 

which gay and lesbian couples 
can marry has nearly doubled 
since October, from 19 to 37, 
largely as a result of terse 
Supreme Court orders that 
allowed lower court rulings to 
become final and rejected state 
efforts to keep marriage bans in 

place pending appeals.

“If 
you 
read 
the 
tea 

leaves the Supreme Court is 
leaving, the bans on same-sex 
marriage can’t be permitted. 
They’re 
unconstitutional,” 

said University of California-
Berkeley law professor Jesse 
Choper.

Alabama became the 37th 

state in which same-sex couples 
can 
marry, 
following 
U.S. 

District Judge Callie Granade’s 
ruling in January that struck 
down 
as 
unconstitutional 

the 
state’s 
statutory 
and 

constitutional bans.

Granade had put her order 

on hold until Monday to let the 
state prepare for the change, 
and State Attorney General 
Luther Strange had asked for 
the delay to be extended for at 
least a few months.

Monday morning, probate 

judges in Alabama began issuing 
marriage licenses to same-sex 
couples, some of whom had 
been lined up for hours.

“It’s 
about 
time,” 
said 

Shante Wolfe, 21, as she left 
the courthouse in Montgomery 
with wife Tori Sisson. They had 
camped out in a blue and white 
tent to be the first in the county 
given a license.

IMPRINTING

Santiago Colas, associate pro-

fessor of comparative literature, 
has taught at the University since 
1992. In 1991 he received a Ph.D 
in Literature from Duke Univer-
sity. This semester, he is teach-
ing “The Cultures of Basketball,” 
a course in the Residential College 
and “Writing the Sporting Body,” a 
comparative literature course.

What inspired you to become a 

professor?

It’s hard to know. It’s not 

something that had ever been 
a dream of mine growing up. I 
think that I went to grad school 
basically to avoid engaging the 
real world when I finished col-
lege, and I thought that might 

be a good way to stave off reality. 
But once I started grad school, I 
found that I was really interest-
ed in what I was learning and 
interested in what professors 
were doing. I think for the first 
time, (I) had an understanding 
that that was a career path, a 
possibility. And the more I did it, 
the more I realized it seemed to 
be the best combination of what 
I like to do with little of what I 
don’t like to do and viable as a liv-
ing. And that’s turned out to be 
the case.

Are most of the courses 

you’re teaching involved with 

sports?

They are now. Over the last 

few years, I’ve kind of shifted 
my area of interest in research 
and teaching from more nar-
rowly literary topics to topics 
related to the culture of sports 
and especially basketball. That’s 
another good thing about being 
a professor, is that you can 
change directions and find sup-
port for that and in that way get 
to stay young, in a way.

What is your favorite part of 

teaching?

Favorite part of teaching is, 
without question, open-ended 
discussions in the classroom.

when you start adding all 
of that extra responsibility, 
the jurisdiction expands and 
it becomes a big burden,” 
Lehman said.

While it was decided that 

the Tenure Committee would 
not be recommended for 
merger with the Rules Com-
mittee, it will be recommend-
ed that the Rules Committee 

be renamed the Rules, Prac-
tices and Policies Commit-
tee. This change would give 
the committee more leverage 
to deal with policy related 
issues.

SACUA also recommended 

the addition of two commit-
tees.

The 
Information 
Tech-

nology Committee was pro-
posed to address technology 
issues. SACUA also proposed 
the Buildings Facilities and 
Infrastructure Committee to 
confront matters within the 
University’s facilities.

to prescribe antibacterial medi-
cation.

Dr. Robert Winfield, chief 

health officer at the University 
Health Service, said e-mails are 
sent to UHS caregivers encour-
aging prescribing Tamiflu.

“Influenza peaked in the first 

week of January, and anybody 
coming in within 48 hours of 
getting sick will be treated with 
Tamiflu,” Winfield said. “Tami-
flu is a useful drug, but after 
four hours it tends to be inef-
fective.”

This 
research 
has 
been 

underway for the past several 
years and trials were conducted 
on more than 4,300 patients 
globally. The study employed 
a placebo-controlled design, 
where patients with placebo 
medication experienced their 
flu symptoms alleviated within 

123 hours — whereas those who 
took Tamiflu were remedied in 
98 hours.

“Observational studies were 

conducted 
with 
a 
double-

blind approach,” Monto said. 
“Neither the patients or the 
researchers were aware of the 
placement of placebo. It was 
done to reduce bias from the 
nature of observations.”

Researchers found the drug 

to be ineffective when admin-
istered to patients not carry-
ing the influenza virus, even if 
they show similar symptoms. 
The study also showed that use 
of pain-relief medications with 
Tamiflu reduced its success.

Though the study demon-

strated Tamiflu’s usefulness, 
Monto stressed the need for 
new 
antiviral 
medications 

that could shorten the dura-
tion of symptoms. He said it 
could be possible to combine 
different antivirals to achieve 
this goal.

ening the Statement to make 
it more “digestible” would 
allow 
students 
to 
“fully 

understand” their expecta-
tions as members of the Uni-
versity community.

While drafting the code, the 

task force plans to consult mem-
bers of the student body — in 
part by holding at least one open 
forum — as well as University 
administrators. Lustig said the 
task force would like to speak to 
members of Greek life and large 
student organizations like the 
Black Student Union, as well as 
the deans of different colleges 
and eventually, University Presi-
dent Mark Schlissel.

CSG representative Steven 

Halperin, an LSA sophomore, 
will serve as the task force’s vice 
chair.

“I wanted to become involved 

in the task force because I want-
ed to be a voice for students,” 
Halperin said. “I feel that it gets 
a little complicated and students 
sometimes get a little confused 
about what is permissible and 
what is not.”

The task force is also com-

prised of students outside of 
CSG.

“We reached out to large 

organizations 
and 
different 

schools within the University 
and tried to get students that 
represent the entire University,” 
Lustig said.

Kyle Lady, a member of Rack-

ham Student Government, will 
also serve on the team.

“I think there’s value in work-

ing on what’s out there and 
where shortcomings might be,” 
Lady said.

Violations of the Statement of 

Student Rights and Responsibil-
ities have garnered significant 
attention this semester. In Janu-
ary, six University Greek chap-
ters were suspended by their 
nationals for reportedly caus-
ing thousands of dollars worth 
of damage at two Michigan ski 
resorts. Sigma Alpha Mu, who 
attended a retreat weekend in 
Gaylord Mich. with Sigma Delta 
Tau, reportedly caused upwards 
of $100,000 in damage to several 
of the hotel’s rooms and com-
mon areas.

If 
found 
responsible 
by 

University disciplinary pro-
cedures, they could face sanc-
tions based on violations of the 
Statement.

However, 
DeCicco 
remains 

optimistic for the future and 
believes that scientific critical 
analyses will help to remove these 
assumptions.

“I, alongside many research-

ers around the world, have

dents to look at race and hunger 
in Detroit from an angle they 
might not have thought about 
before.

“We just really wanted to 

focus on different areas of food 
justice,” she said. “Social justice 
doesn’t just happen one way, 
you can look at the same prob-
lem and have a lot of different 
solutions for it.”

Growing up, Hatinger, the 

garden coordinator, said he was 
the only biracial resident in a 
small Lansing suburb. He said 
he moved to Detroit to learn 
about a new culture that might 
subsequently help him learn 
more about himself. With his 
work in spirituality, agriculture 
and community development, 
he strives to bring together 
larger issues in the city like 
health, education and nutri-
tion.

Pothukuchi, who was raised 

in Mumbai, India, employs her 
work in architecture and com-
munity planning to find links 
between 
communities 
and 

their food systems. Similar to 
Hatinger, Pothukuchi noted 
the importance of address-
ing Detroit’s larger problems 
including water shutoffs, hous-
ing shortages and poor land 
quality.

“We don’t really plan for 

food, that thinking is shift-
ing partly due to the work my 
colleagues and I have done in 
raising 
awareness 
between 

the links between community 
planning and food systems 
and how integral those links 
are and how many community 
goals you can advance by inter-
vening in the food system,” she 
said.

A 
self-described 
activist 

since the age of 11, Amakisi 
became involved in food access 
work after noticing the mini-
mal knowledge Detroit resi-
dents had of cooking healthy 
meals and finding adequate 
ingredients to feed their fami-
lies.

Growing up in a family of 

farmers from the South, Amak-
isi said she realized the neces-
sity of relating to the Detroit 
residents she was trying to 
serve. To do so, she shifted 
the conversation to focus on 
the ways in which problems 
related to food access shaped 
other problems within the 
city.

“By growing food and these 

basic issues I’m also able to 
also get them involved in water 
rights, I’m also able to talk to 
them about neoliberalism and 
privatization and issues that 
relate to relate to their basic 
needs first,” she said.

The dialogue brought in the 

panelists’ 
backgrounds 
and 

their wide array of experienc-
es to help explain barriers to 
food accessibility within the 
city.

Pothukuchi, speaking from 

her experience as an urban 
planner and architect, used 
history and city development 
to help understand these bar-
riers.

She explained that though 

Detroit once housed various 
local, 
independently 
owned 

grocery stores, they were sold 
out by larger corporations like 
A&P, Kroger and Walmart — 
stores with buying power to 
bankrupt local growers and 
local sellers.

Furthermore, as aid from the 

federal government declined, 
the city took money from 
local elites and corporations 
while ignoring and neglecting 
exploited residents.

“You can talk about the cor-

ruption that politicians, about 
Kwame, you can talk about 
Kwame buying SUVs and the 
corruption, but Detroit did not 
cause the problems it experi-
ences,” Pothukuchi said.

Amakisi 
described 
the 

hardships residents face in 
the context of food accessibil-
ity, pointing to the way public 
schools take away food stamps 
if children miss too much 
school and the long distances 
residents often walk to reach 
gas stations that only sell pro-
cessed food.

Amakisi also mentioned 

the lack of knowledge resi-
dents in and out of the city 
have about growing and cook-
ing food, saying that training 
people to build their own gar-
dens and cook their own food 
can have a direct impact on 
developing and supporting 
the city.

Hatinger said power-holders 

like politicians and corpora-
tions oppressed residents by 
controlling the distribution and 
access to food and thus limit-
ing the resources of the general 
public. He added that learning 
about the dynamics of power 
and giving food resources back 
to the people is what propels 
him to do his work with agri-
culture in the city.

“It’s natural, it’s natural to 

every person on the globe and 
it’s more so about getting peo-
ple back in touch, letting them 
learn how to foster and sustain 
life”

The panel continued the dis-

cussion to help identify the con-
fluences of food and the city’s 
racial history.

Hatinger touched on the 

stigma of agriculture and farm-
ing Black residents may feel due 
to its historic connection with 
sharecropping and slavery.

Amakisi spoke on the way 

that the construction of free-
ways cut through thriving 
Black communities within the 
cities and the arrival of big 
businesses demolished exist-
ing homes and agricultural 
land.

LSA freshman Elena Mosher, 

who attended Monday’s panel, 
said the biggest takeaway was 
the larger role food accessibil-
ity plays in the more publicized 
problems within the city.

“One 
thing 
that’s 
really 

important is just realizing that, 
like one of them said, these 
problems aren’t the fault of the 
people in Detroit, it’s really part 
of the bigger food system and 
we need to work with educa-
tion and proactive movements 
to combat the oppression that 
has already occurred,” Mosh-
er said.

Public Policy junior Hattie 

McKinney said she felt a larger 
responsibility as a college stu-
dent to lead the movement 
to improve food resources 
and spread awareness of the 
potential harms that food 
consolidation brings to inner-
city residents like those in 
Detroit.

“Basically, 
what 
every-

one should know is that we 
should take more interest in 
where our food comes from, 
as well as what we can do 
to make it healthier, and to 
share with those who don’t 
have access to food at all,” 
she said.

Millersville University students attend a candlelight vigil for slain student Karlie Hall. 
Boyfriend charged for 
college student’s death

Freshman arrested 

for homicide 

following autopsy

MILLERSVILLE, Pa. (AP) — 

The boyfriend of a college fresh-
man found dead in her dorm 
room was charged Monday with 
homicide after an autopsy found 
she had been severely beaten 
and strangled, during a struggle 
in which a prosecutor said she 
“fought for her life.”

Police officers responding to 

a 911 call early Sunday from the 
boyfriend, Gregorio Orrostieta, 
19, said they found him trying to 
administer CPR to Karlie Hall, 
18, his own face, hands and 
jeans smeared with blood, his 
shirt ripped, his chest scratched 
and his forehead cut, a police 
affidavit said.

Authorities believe the CPR 

was “completely fake,” and that 
Hall had already been dead for 
hours when Orrostieta called 
them to Millersville Univer-
sity, claiming the young woman 
had suffered a heart attack, 
said Lancaster County District 
Attorney Craig Stedman.

Questioned by police, Orros-

tieta said he shoved Hall, caus-
ing her to fall and hit her head 
on a chair, and then gave her a 
“back hand” to the face, the affi-
davit said. But he made no men-
tion of choking her.

“He’s responsible and we’re 

going to hold him accountable,” 
Stedman told a news confer-
ence to announce the homicide 
charge. He had been charged 
only with aggravated assault 
pending the autopsy.

“She fought for her life,” the 

prosecutor said.

The dorm’s video surveil-

lance confirmed that no one else 
entered or left the room during 
the time when a struggle was 
heard in the dorm room.

The couple, both from the 

Philadelphia suburbs, had been 

dating about 11 months.

Orrostieta, 
of 
Kennett 

Square, is not a Millersville stu-
dent. He was being held without 
bail. The prosecutor said he did 
not have a lawyer on record, and 
no one answered the door at his 
residence Monday afternoon.

Orrostieta told police that he 

and Hall, 18, of Chadds Ford, 
had argued at a party Saturday 
night and she had hit him, the 
affidavit said. They made up 
before returning to the dorm 
at around 1:30 a.m. and arguing 
again, the affidavit said. Sted-
man declined to say if there was 
a history of abuse.

Stedman 
said 
witnesses 

reported hearing yelling and 
the sound of furniture moving 
between 2 and 2:30 a.m., about 
the time authorities believe Hall 
was killed.

The dorm’s resident assistant 

knocked on the door, but no one 
answered and no further sound 
was heard, authorities said.

Police found Hall unrespon-

sive when they arrived at Bard 
Hall after getting the 911 call at 
about 5 a.m., authorities said.

Asked about the resident 

assistant not calling police, 
Stedman said: “They’re not 
criminal investigators. Their 
responsibility is ... to make sure 
there’s no more disturbances 
going on.”

“It’s something that we’ll 

look at,” he said while adding: 
“I don’t want in any way any-
body taking out of this press 
conference today that any-
body’s responsible for her death 
other than the defendant who’s 
charged.”

University 
spokeswoman 

Janet Kacskos said the RA was 
awoken by other residents who 
heard the noise. After knocking 
and not getting any response, 
she figured they had “quieted 
down,” Kacskos said.

In a note to students, Millers-

ville President John Anderson 
called Hall’s death “unfathom-

able.” “We’ve never had this 
happen. We’re a pretty bucolic, 
rural campus. Very safe,” Kacs-
kos said.

Hundreds of students attend-

ed an outdoor vigil for Hall 
Monday night at Millersville, an 
8,000-student state-owned uni-
versity. Standing in the rain and 
holding candles, many of them 
wept as they sang two hymns 
and campus minister Dwayne 
Netzler prayed, the Reading 
Eagle reported.

Friends said Hall was a 

finance 
major 
who 
always 

appeared happy and often spent 
her free time going to the gym 
or feeding ducks at a campus 
pond.

“I knew that the relation-

ship wasn’t that great,” said 
Hall’s friend, Trisha Faust, 19, of 
Emmaus. “It was on-again, off-
again.”

Molly Gaetano, 19, of Pitts-

burgh, who lived two doors 
down from Hall on the second 
floor of the three-story dormi-
tory, said she last spoke to her 
Friday.

“She never talked bad about 

anyone. She was always smiling 
and cheerful,” Gaetano said.

A memorial with flowers and 

cards was set up at Hall’s dorm 
room.

Hall and her twin sister, Kris-

tin, graduated from Unionville 
High School last June and went 
to Millersville together, Princi-
pal Paula Massanari said. The 
girls also have an older sister.

Hall was a member of the 

school rugby club and gay-
straight 
alliance, 
and 
she 

volunteered at an animal shel-
ter, Massanari said. She was 
described in a college recom-
mendation letter as a “hard-
working” student, who was 
working a part-time job to help 
offset the cost of college.

“This has certainly hit our 

school community very hard,” 
Massanari said. “We are devas-
tated by the loss.”

MOUNT PLEASANT, MICHIGAN 
CMU head coach 
plans for long career 

Like so many schools in the 

Mid-American 
Conference, 

Central Michigan faces a real 
challenge maintaining continuity 
in its football program.

Everyone wants a coach who 

wins — but win too much, and 
your coach becomes a candidate 
for other jobs pretty quickly.

In John Bonamego, CMU may 

have found someone who can buck 
that trend.

“I plan to win, win now, and 

be here for a very, very, very, very, 
very long time,” Bonamego said.

Bonamego 
was 
introduced 

as the Chippewas’ new coach 
Monday, his voice cracking with 
emotion 
almost 
immediately 

as he described his connection 
to the school where he was a 
player during the mid-1980s. 
The question now is whether his 
passion for CMU will translate to 
victories on the field in his return 
to college football after a lengthy 
stretch as an NFL assistant.

BOSTON, MASS.
Cities struggle after 
record snowfall 

More than 2 feet of fresh snow 

piled up in parts of New England 
on Monday, breaking records set 
during the Blizzard of 1978 and 
testing the patience of officials 
and commuters as forecasters 
warned of more winter misery 
later in the week.

The latest onslaught forced 

the cancellations of hundreds 
of flights, tested transit systems 
and tempers, and collapsed roofs 
straining beneath the weight of 5 
feet or more of snow that has fall-
en in less than two weeks.

“It’s awful. I’m done with it. It’s 

ridiculous,” said Priscilla Medina, 
a sandwich shop worker in West-
borough, 
Massachusetts, 
suf-

fering from a nasty case of snow 
fatigue.

KABUL, AFGHANISTAN 
Drone strike kills 
Islamic State Leader

The top recruiter for the Islamic 

State group’s affiliate in Afghani-
stan was killed by a drone strike 
Monday, local officials said, mark-
ing the first such attack on the 
extremist group in a volatile coun-
try where it has a small but grow-
ing following.

U.S. officials said a total of eight 

people were killed in the drone 
strike, but could not confirm the 
Islamic State recruiter’s death.

The deputy governor of the 

southern Helmand province iden-
tified the recruiter as Abdul Rauf, 
saying he and others were killed 
when a drone-fired missile struck 
their car.

The attack would appear to deal 

a blow to the Islamic State group’s 
efforts to develop a local affiliate to 
challenge the long-dominant Taliban.

Last month, Afghan tribal lead-

ers and Western intelligence ana-
lysts told The Associated Press that 
Abdul Rauf was the top Islamic 
State recruiter in Helmand. Rauf 
had been held in the Guantanamo 
Bay detention center in Cuba for 
his involvement with the Taliban.

CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA 
Prime minister 
maintains powers 

Australia’s beleaguered Prime 

Minister Tony Abbott emerged 
politically wounded after with-
standing a leadership challenge 
from within his own party Monday, 
with many analysts doubting he can 
survive to lead his conservative gov-
ernment to next year’s elections.

The polarizing leader’s grip on 

power has slipped since last month 
when he drew widespread criticism 
for making Queen Elizabeth II’s 
93-year-old husband, Prince Philip, 
an Australian knight on Australia’s 
national day. Many saw it as an 
insult to worthy Australians. 

Abbott, in office less than a year-

and-a-half, survived a move by dis-
gruntled Liberal Party members 
calling for a secret ballot to decide 
who would be prime minister.

4 — Tuesday, February 10, 2015

T

wo weeks ago, Jonathan 
Chait, an alumnus of the Uni-
versity and The Michigan 

Daily, published a 
much-clicked essay 
on political correct-
ness, his pen intent-
ly focused on the 
popular topic of free 
speech on campus. 
Chait’s piece argues 
that the left has 
employed a strategy 
of censorship, espe-
cially within aca-
demia and social 
media, stifling free 
expression in order to win debates 
about race, gender and sexuality. 
But what Chait misses, and what so 
many commentators and politicians 
miss talking about this issue, is the 
ability for free speech to stifle other 
free speech — an Outrage/Silence 
Roundabout. Here’s how it works:

One person, person one, starts 

talking. Another person, person 
two, interprets something about 
their argument as so preposterous 
and hurtful that person two feels 
offended. Person two can respond 
in a number of ways: they can label 
the idea as offensive and attack the 
other person’s argument, they can 
label the idea as offensive and out-
right dismiss it without explanation, 
or they can say nothing at all.

In Chait’s article, the typical 

response from person two is choos-
ing to publicly take offense without 
explanation. The events play out 
 

as such:

Person one denies their bigotry 

and asks for explanation. Person 
two could explain, but instead they 
push the outrage further, claim-
ing it isn’t their responsibility to 
educate someone on how to not be 
an asshole. Moreover, person two 
argues the fact that person one can’t 
see the ignorance behind what they 
say shows just how bigoted they 
are. Person one, feeling personally 
attacked and otherwise bewildered, 
shuts down and learns nothing.

That scenario is a nightmare for 

the future of education. However, 
Chait hugely ignores the other, far 
worse scenario that often plays out:

Person one says something that 

person two finds as deeply offensive, 
and person two — in fear of being 

called too sensitive or having their 
identity attacked — says nothing.

This scenario and others like it 

have driven a great deal of “P.C. 
policing” at the University, from 
the adoption of a Race and Ethnic-
ity requirement to the #BBUM cam-
paign. This is all an attempt to grow, 
not stifle, free speech and promote 
intellectual growth. None of us are 
entitled to feel comfortable at all 
times, and being educated requires 
us to even avoid comfort. But there 
is a difference between comfort and 
what has come to be called “safety.”

Creating a “safe space” (terminol-

ogy I personally loathe to no end) is 
nothing more than setting ground 
rules for conversation and debate, 
largely to avoid the Outrage/Silence 
Roundabout. The typical rules of 
a safe space are far from oppres-
sive: speak for yourself and not oth-
ers; attack ideas, not people; don’t 
over-generalize. This requires a 
great deal of patience for everyone 
involved, and different spaces have 
different focuses and hence, dif-
ferent rules. No one can seriously 
expect the world at large to ever 
become one giant safe space, and 
screaming accusations of threats to 
one’s “safety” are rarely construc-
tive if missing an explanation.

Ironically, Chait is calling for 

exactly the same thing he is attack-
ing: the adoption of ground rules 
for how we debate, so that no one 
feels silenced — in his case, non-left 
wingers. I would agree with Chait 
that zealous outrage is, if anything, 
stifling toward the free exchange of 
ideas that is necessary for education.

Unfortunately, this rather simple 

idea finds itself muddled in Chait’s 
equating of political correctness 
with flat-out oppression of demo-
cratic free speech. Chait ends his 
article with a gushing review of 
non-left wing American liberalism, 
whose “glory rests in its confidence 
in the ultimate power of reason, not 
coercion, to triumph.”

Aaron Sorkin would be proud, 

but I have a feeling most historians 
would disagree.

Coercion has in fact been the 

driving force behind most of Amer-
ica’s great leaps forward when it 
comes to race. Slavery saw its end 
thanks to the sword, not the pen. 
Roosevelt didn’t desegregate mili-

tary contracting because he loved 
racial equality, but because A. Philip 
Randolph threatened a massive, 
crippling march on Washington, 
D.C. The Supreme Court may have 
been convinced of school desegrega-
tion, but the South certainly wasn’t. 
Perhaps Jonathan Chait’s memory 
failed him, but the Freedom Rid-
ers, the Little Rock Nine and Vivian 
Malone didn’t win an argument — 
they were surrounded by soldiers.

Chait wants people to fight for 

justice by creating agreement with 
strong argument and reason. But 
what happens when the people who 
need to be convinced are unreason-
able? The movement for political cor-
rectness has no doubt overreached 
at times, but quite often the anger of 
left-wing groups is fueled by liberal 
apathy or resistance to progress. 
Michigan is no stranger to this phe-
nomenon, as Chait detailed in a 2001 
American Prospect article.

During the late 1980s, Chait 

wrote, left-wing groups — most 
notably 
the 
United 
Coalition 

Against Racism — controlled Mich-
igan’s campus. The left-controlled 
student government pushed the 
school to adopt an unconstitutional 
speech code and even invalidated 
elections when their majority in the 
student assembly was threatened. 
This is the kind of blind, unrea-
sonable climate colleges want to 
avoid, and it led to a large conser-
vative backlash. Michigan’s cam-
pus is in a far better position now, 
but it is because, not in spite, of the 
demands of the left wing.

While the speech code was an 

abysmal failure, the late 1980s and the 
1990s saw the creation of the Race and 
Ethnicity requirement and the Pro-
gram on Intergroup Relations. It also 
cemented a legacy of anti-racism at 
Michigan, one that continues to this 
day. There are occasional missteps and 
overreaches — some much worse than 
others — but left-wing demands that 
began in the ‘60s have consistently 
driven colleges to new heights of inclu-
sion and scholarship. Chait and others 
may be living in fear of “P.C. culture” 
ruining free speech, but that same cul-
ture is to thank for countless students 
having any kind of voice at all.

M

easles is back. The much-pub-
licized storyline drips of the 
ironic: the outbreak began at 

Disneyland in Anaheim, 
California 
in 
Decem-

ber, yet it was an entirely 
 

preventable outbreak.

When John Enders began 

his investigation of measles 
in 1953, the disease infected 
some four million children 
per year. 50,000 were hospi-
talized annually. According 
to a biography published by 
The Royal Society, Enders 
hardly came from a calami-
tous background.

Born in 1897 in West Hartford, Connecti-

cut, with a successful banker for a father, 
he attended private boarding school and 
then Yale. An English major early on, and a 
failed real estate investor later, he was finally 
exposed to the laboratory under the influence 
of René Dubos. Eventually earning a Ph.D. 
with a concentration in microbiology, he 
began much of his work with vaccination dur-
ing World War II. His “unceasing insistence 
on truth … (and) his sense of wonder … at the 
great mystery that exists and surrounds all 
of God’s creation” led to much success. After 
earning a Nobel Prize for his discoveries that 
facilitated the development of the Salk vac-
cine, Enders refocused on “the rash diseases 
of childhood.”

By the early 1960s, he cultured the proto-

type Edmonston strain used in the first inoc-
ulations. The measles vaccine cocktail was 
introduced in 1963. With its contemporary 
permutation deemed “MMR,” (effective for 
measles, mumps and rubella) the vaccine has 
effectively eliminated the single most infec-
tious disease on the face of the Earth since. 
In 2000, the disease was considered eradi-
cated from the United States. The vaccine is 
a miracle of modern science. Enders is esti-
mated to have saved 113 million lives since 
its introduction.

Back to Disneyland: it seems insidiously 

suitable that only in such a fantasy land would 
parents ignore scientific reality in favor of fore-
boding oldwives tales. One disproven, “fraud-
ulent” study in particular continues to fuel the 

fire of anti-vaccination movements. Autism is 
the malicious antagonist of a paper published 
(and later rescinded) from prestigious medi-
cal journal The Lancet. The novelist, one Dr. 
Andrew Wakefield, has since been banned 
from the profession for a “callous disregard” 
for children participating in his research stud-
ies, as well as his having “brought the medical 
profession into disrepute.”

Yet, the implications of his sensational fic-

tion endure. Anecdotes, such as that of for-
mer Playgirl and anti-vaccine activist Jenny 
McCarthy, stoke the emotional flames inciner-
ating the medical rationality of parents every-
where. Such scientific negligence disrupts 
public health by opening holes in the herd 
immunity of the population. In other words, it 
leads to a snowball effect. That’s how, in two 
years, measles cases jump 13 times.

The outbreaks have led to much polar-

ization in the political arena. A conflict of 
free will versus governmental mandate has 
erupted. Perhaps the most concerning is 
the passivism of the GOP response. Political 
agendas convolute what is a tremendously 
clear issue here: vaccinate your kids. Plat-
forms, it seems, take precedence. Arguments 
over the aisle put children’s lives at risks. 
Brainwashing via waxing poetic over consti-
tutional rights is as much a contagion as the 
virus itself.

No. To me, there is no debate, nor confu-

sion: medical realities and the preservation 
of human wellbeing, as based in scientific 
fact, should not be perverted into a philo-
sophical, partisan, “patriotic” stalemate. 
It is myopic and malignant, uninformed 
and irresponsible.

Legislatively, Congress ought to take 

action on this. Exemption systems need to 
be overhauled. School districts must enforce 
vaccination requirements. Simple.

A broader point worth making here is this: 

remain wary of the floating heads. As future 
colleagues, neighbors and parents, we ought 
to stay educated on fact over fantasy. Use your 
freedom to make the obvious, uncomplicated, 
correct decisions. Sometimes that can be a 
matter of life and death.

Vexation and vaccination

ELI
CAHAN

R

ecently, outbreaks of measles — a disease which was 
formerly classified as eradicated — have emerged in areas 
throughout the country, including Grand Traverse and 

Leelanau counties in Michigan. The resurgence of preventable 
diseases, like measles and pertussis, corresponds with a disturbing 
trend in which an increasing number of individuals are refraining 
from vaccinations for themselves and their children. Cases of 
measles are now beginning to infiltrate college campuses with 
occurrences of the disease reported at institutions, such as Bard 
College, Moorpark College and California State University, Channel 
Islands. The recent rise of measles, along with other diseases, has 
prompted considerable concern and stresses a dire need for the 
University and the state to re-evaluate and reform their current 
vaccination policies.

In reaction to the outbreaks, the state has 

made some strides to protect public health. 
Instituted by the Michigan Department 
of Community Health, a new policy that 
commenced on Jan. 1 mandates that parents 
who wish to refrain from getting their 
children vaccinated for “philosophical or 
religious reasons” are now required to obtain 
certified waivers from their local health 
department. According to Jennifer Smith, a 
spokeswoman for the Michigan Department 
of Community Health, the institution of this 
provision “will help ensure that those who 
may choose to sign the waiver have accurate 
information 
and 
education” 
regarding 

immunization measures.

Though the state has made some progress, 

Michigan continues to possess a high vaccine 
exemption rate. Vaccination policies on the 
state level contribute to the creation of more 
lenient standards at institutions of higher 
education. The University doesn’t require 
the general student population — with the 
exception of those enrolled in the Medical 
School — to be vaccinated before enrolling, nor 
does it require an accurate record of a student’s 
immunization history. University Health 
Services notifies students of recommended 
immunizations and requests students submit 
their immunization history before starting 
classes. However, no consequences exist for 
those who don’t comply. Similar policies are 
in effect at Michigan State University, but 
all students are, at least, required to submit 
 

their vaccination record.

While the University should not immediately 

mandate vaccinations for the student body, it 
should move in that direction. In doing so, a 
more rigorous process needs to be instituted 
to ensure students’ safety as well as their 
individual and religious freedoms. Rather than 
using an opt-in stance toward the University’s 
immunization policy, an alternative opt-out 
procedure should be adopted. Doing so would 
aid in creating procedures that increase the 
number of vaccinated students but still allows 
individuals to opt out for religious reasons.

In addition to policy measures, vaccine 

education efforts must be increased to combat 
the reappearance of infectious diseases, such 
as measles and pertussis. The recent decline 
in immunizations can be attributed to an 
anti-vaccine movement fueled by fears and 
myths regarding immunization side effects. 
Subsets of the population express concern that 
vaccines are unnatural or contribute to the 
development of autism, though no evidence 
exists to support these claims. Studies linking 
autism and vaccines were disproven.

The state — as a measure to contain 

the disease — should specifically institute 
education reforms in areas already affected 
by outbreaks. To guard against more 
avoidable outbreaks, factual information 
regarding vaccines should be integrated 
into class curriculum to allow students to 
better understand the preventative measures 
available to them.

I 

am an English major liv-
ing in a hall of future NASA 
engineers, Wall Street inves-

tors and hospital 
presidents. 
It’s 

often intimidating 
to be surrounded 
on a daily basis 
by such talented, 
intelligent 
peers 

— not only as an 
LSA student, but 
an LSA humanities 
major among Engi-
neering, Ross and 
Nursing students.

Just one look at 

your homework already confirms 
that 
whatever 
coding-calculus-

chemical language you’re speaking 
flies right over my head. Although 
I can’t even remotely comprehend 
your work, I can relate to your work-
load struggles as I sit down to write 
papers and read hundreds of pages 
each night. When you bemoan the 
loss of your social lives and the loss 
of the light of day, I get that.

What I don’t understand, how-

ever, is why in your eyes, I will never 
“truly” understand. My work is so 
easy in comparison — I can never 
really be “busy.”

The word “difficult” has become so 

elusive. What exactly does a “tough” 
major entail? According to colloquial 
standards at this University, “hard,” 
by default, equates directly to the 
STEM or business fields — more 
specifically, majors alienated into 
exclusivity in separate University 
schools with lower acceptance rates 
and higher rankings. It is commonly 
known that majors in the fields of 
engineering, medicine, business and 
the like lead to high-stakes, high-sal-
ary careers in the future — and thus, 
they are notoriously assumed to have 
heavier course loads.

I don’t deny the fact that your 

classes are fast-paced, your fields 
rigorous and your homework time-
consuming. I truly admire the dedi-
cation you must put into academics, 
and I have no doubt you are some of 
the most hard-working students at 

this University. So, in my pronounce-
ment of liberal arts, I do not mean 
to denounce STEM field majors. 
However, where does the vehicle for 
comparison come in? How can the 
challenges of any two vastly differ-
ent fields be likened to one another?

The term “difficulty,” in the 

scholarly sense, should mean men-
tal strain and effort. To get a dic-
tionary with it: Merriam-Webster 
defines it vaguely as “something 
that is not easy to do or to deal 
with” — thus, something that 
requires acute intellect, arduous 
toil, demanding devotion. If this is 
the case, as LSA majors, we put in 
the same abundance of hours as any 
engineer, nurse or businessperson. 
Our work all transpires an equiva-
lent degree of difficulty, but just 
for different reasons.

STEM is “flashy” and so highly 

regarded in our society because it 
requires innovation far exceeding 
the mundane. STEM is our fore-
seeable future. The techniques and 
abilities 
engineers, 
economists, 

physicians must use — coding, 
multi-syllabic 
molecular 
terms, 

advanced calculus — are usu-
ally fields most pedestrians (even 
college-educated ones) have never 
dabbled in or even looked at.

However, with reading and writ-

ing — at least in our developed West-
ern world — the majority of people 
begin accumulating this skill from 
age three or four. Communication 
remains a fundamental skill that we 
are all required to master in order to 
survive in society. From a myopic, 
superficial standpoint, the liberal 
arts offer no “innovation” beyond 
anything we all already know. Read-
ing and writing — most of us can do 
that. But coding, calculus, chem-
istry — that jumble of numbers we 
don’t understand — that’s impressive. 
Rocket science is breathtaking to all 
of us who don’t possess that knowl-
edge behind the scenes. We find most 
formidable what we don’t under-
stand — a realm much higher than 
anything we have seen before.

However, there is quite a flaw in 

this idea. Though reading, think-
ing and writing may be the most 
fundamental, universal skills — it 
is the most difficult to master the 
basics. As English, psychology, his-
tory majors, we are the future con-
tent creators of your print, your 
screen and the very mobile devices 
you design. To be able to make read-
ers feel something — to illicit real 
tears, to stimulate love or heart-
break, or resentment in their souls, 
or pity in their hearts — that is an 
ability unlike any other. Words 
and thoughts have the capacity to 
inspire further thoughts — to incite 
revolutionary ideas that provoke 
social action and galvanize global 
progression. This ability to under-
stand human nature, to evoke 
emotion through communication, 
to control human emotion and 
thought, is what we are in training 
to do in college. That is our course-
work where we put all our time and 
effort. And that is powerful.

Again, I do not say this in 

denouncement of your field, but 
rather in admiration for your equal 
but different significance. To com-
pare such diversity would be like 
comparing apples to oranges.

So, the next time I talk about an 

essay I have to write, don’t scoff 
because you think my toil is play in 
comparison to yours. I respect your 
field, your whole-hearted devotion 
and ambition. I’m next to you each 
night when we’re both still in the 
library at 3 a.m. Now please, respect 
the time I must take in order to craft 
an argument that is clear in syntax, 
concise in craft, pleasant to the ear 
— one that entertains readers and 
also moves them with poignancy. 
I’m crafting an argument that prac-
tically proves a point and simulta-
neously speaks eloquently. Writing, 
thinking, analyzing: these are skills 
critical to our society, albeit not in 
the same way that creating the next 
rocket ship, investment corporation 
or cancer medication is.

Red carpet recap: 
Trends of 2015

Grammys fashion 

showcases boob cages 

and metallics

By KATIE CAMPBELL

For The Daily

The top trends at the Grammys 

this year spanned all across the 
fashion spectrum. Some were new 
(shoutout to colored metallics) 
and some were beyond old (take 
a shot for every silver dress stum-
bling down the red carpet, you’ll 
be drunk enough to headbang to 
AC/DC’s opener). Sirens played 
peek-a-boo 
with 
cutouts 
and 

floundered with volume. Unfor-
tunately, simplicity was tossed out 
of the metaphorical window, with 
the exception of the gorgeously 
sleek Jennifer Hudson in a white 
column dress by Tom Ford. Boob 
cages, calf-length hemlines and 
dangerously over-the-top fabrics 
overwhelmed on the red carpet 
this year. Let’s pray the stars learn 
from the following mistakes and 
take a note from the scarce tri-
umphs in time for Oscar night.

Metallic

Metallic was seen on almost 

every typically risk-taking starlet 
this year, most notably Lady Gaga 
and Katy Perry. Both were disap-
pointing, but for different reasons. 
Gaga’s custom design from stylist 
Brandon Maxwell looked like an 
ill-fitted, low-budget Broadway 
costume. The deep v-cut neckline 
made a mockery of her endowed 
chest and the high slit only served 
to emphasize her short stature. 
Gaga could have pulled it off with 
more classic styling, perhaps a 
softer smoky eye and a cleaner 
blow out. However, no one wants 
to look like a bar crooner that was 
kicked out at 4 a.m. It was the 
ultimate contrast to Nicki Minaj’s 

stunning low-cut fringed num-
ber, courtesy of Tom Ford. Minaj’s 
dress nailed the metallic look with 
a play on texture with a soft, spar-
kling sheen.

Luckily, a new variety of metal-

lic made its way onto the scene 
from the good graces of couture 
designer Elie Saab. Taylor Swift 
took on the carpet with a beauti-
ful, shimmering aqua structured 
gown. The dress featured cutouts 
on the shoulders and a blink-and-
you’ll-miss-it high-low hemline. 
It was like a futuristic, mermaid 
Marie Antoinette — and it rocked. 
I’ve seen this look be knocked 
around for having prom dress ten-
dencies, however, with great risk 
comes great reward and Swifty 
knocked it out of the park with this 
look.

Cutouts

Cutouts have been a trend since 

prom girls decided they wanted 
tighter dresses and higher heels, 
which is to say they’ve been 
around for the last four years. This 
trend is becoming its own worst 
enemy. When it was scarce, it was 
a playful and flirtatious look, worn 
only on risk-taking women who 
flirt with danger. Now, the trend is 
becoming more and more unflat-
tering with each snip of the fabric. 
Highlights from this game were 
Chrissy Teigen in a white Gucci 
number with symmetrical square 
cutouts highlighting her figure. 
Teigen gets bonus points for hubby 
John Legend’s Dolce & Gabbana 
sleek gray suit and gentle soul. 
I’m hesitant to add Miley Cyrus 
in Alexandre Vauthier to the mix 
since the whole showing off the 
pelvic bone thing is generally 
unflattering. However, it was a risk 
that stood out on the carpet, and 
she looked radiant with soft styl-
ing, seemingly low-impact make-
up and a pulled back hairstyle. 
Lowlights go to “American Idol” 

star Katharine McPhee in Emilio 
Pucci and Miranda Lambert in 
Gabriela Cadena for the unflatter-
ing boob cages. 

Volume

The sheer amount of exuber-

ant volume that fluffed its way 
down the carpet was enough to 
cause an uproar online. Rihanna 
in Giambattista Valli Haute Cou-
ture was a specifically hot topic. 
Ciara, however, was not. RiRi 
has proven to be able to pull off 
pretty much anything, from the 
oversized men’s suit-jacket she 
wore in her performance with 
Kanye West and Paul McCartney 
later in the night to her nearly-
nude mesh dress at last year’s 
CFDA Awards. Yes, Rihanna 
looked like a super buoyant pink 
cloud combined with an eight-
year-old’s Barbie pink cake dress, 
but she had so much fun with it 
and brought some much-needed 
enthusiasm to the carpet. She 
made fashion fun and she made 
the dress hers and that’s what is 
so great about it. Ciara, though, 
looked like she was dragging a 
trash bag down the aisle, which 
was neither fun nor enthusias-
tic. There’s a difference between 
wearing the volume and working 
with it and letting it overwhelm 
you. 

That being said, I’d like to 

remind everyone of Anna Win-
tour’s red carpet commentary 
from last summer: “(Celebrities) 
have all these teams of people 
telling them what to do, what 
to wear, how to do their hair, 
make-up. And they’re so scared 
of being criticized, whereas, you 
know, what’s wrong with looking 
different? How many mermaid 
fishtail strapless sequin gowns 
can we see?”

Taking this into consideration, 

let’s hope the stylists bring their 
all for Oscar night.

Don’t criticize Kanye 
for Beck comments

By ADAM DEPOLLO

Managing Arts Editor

I’ll come right out with it 

— I didn’t watch most of the 
Grammys. 

That might be a bold admission 

to make for the Co-Managing 
Editor of the Daily’s Arts section, 
but I honestly don’t think you 
can blame me for it. I mean, let’s 
be real, any organization that 
was still nominating the Dave 
Matthews Band for Album of 
the Year in 2010 clearly exists in 
some sort of dystopian mytho-
poetic realm where — as they say 
in “Whose Line Is It Anyway?” 
— the rules are made up and the 
points don’t matter. 

Every 
single 
year, 
the 

nominations for the myriad 
Newspeakian 
Grammy 

categories 
are 
announced 

(“Urban 
Contemporary” 

anyone?), 
the 
public 
makes 

known its revulsion toward 
the various irrelevancies that 
invariably make their way into 
those categories, and we then 
let loose a paradoxical torrent 
of blind rage and complete 
dejection when the awards go to 
the wrong people. 

So why do we keep watching? 

I ask myself that question every 
year, and I struggle to find any 
answer other than that, at this 
point, we’re just in the habit of 
doing it. Or, even worse, maybe 
we like it.

But I’m not really here to talk 

about why we keep engaging 
in the sadomasochism that is 
watching the Grammys. That’s 
a question for psychologists, or 
maybe E. L. James. 

I’m here to talk about the one 

interesting thing that did happen 
at the awards show on Sunday 
night, which, unsurprisingly, 
came from one of the few 
consistently interesting people 
in the constellation of modern 
pop culture: Kanye West. 

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the 

Grammy 
Award 
for 
Album 

of the Year went not to the 
obvious winner in that category 

Beyoncé), 
according 
to 
any 

possible criteria by which to 
judge it, but to Beck’s Morning 
Phase. 

The incredulity in the room 

was palpable as the 44-year-
old rocker walked on stage, his 
eyes darting nervously from the 
audience to the presenters — he 
would later state that he thought 
Beyoncé was going to win the 
award — when, suddenly, Kanye 
walked up in front of him, 
reached his hand toward the 
microphone and then stopped 
short. He held up his hand in a 
gesture of pause, flashed a smile, 
turned around and went back 
to his seat. It was over almost 
as soon as it began, but those 
brief moments (and Beyoncé’s 
stunning homage to “Selma” 
and, by extension, the entire 
“Black Lives Matter” campaign) 
were without question the most 
memorable, the most real things 
that might be drawn from such 
a vapid and out-of-touch affair. 

I would think that the beauty 

of 
Kanye’s 
“interruption” 

should speak for itself, but the 
response from social media and 
a good number of pop culture 
commentators — the real reason 
why I’m writing this piece — has 
astonishingly focused on the 
supposed audacity of doing what 
every halfway honest consumer 
of pop music wanted to see 
happen in the first place. 

In an interview with E! after 

the awards show, Kanye clearly 
explained his motivation for the 
silent outburst: 

“I 
just 
know 
that 
the 

Grammys, if they want real 

artists to keep coming back, 
they 
need 
to 
stop 
playing 

with us. We ain’t gonna play 
with them no more. And Beck 
needs to respect artistry and 
he should’ve given his award 
to Beyoncé, because when you 
keep on diminishing art and 
not respecting the craft and 
smacking people in their face 
after they deliver monumental 
feats 
of 
music, 
you’re 

disrespectful 
to 
inspiration. 

And we as musicians have to 
inspire people who go to work 
every day, and they listen to 
that Beyoncé album and they 
feel like it takes them to another 
place.”

To me, that’s not a speech that 

smacks of egotism and privilege 
(Kanye does, after all, give up his 
awards when he feels he doesn’t 
deserve them). He points out, 
correctly I think, that creating 
a piece of artwork that sells 2.2 
million copies in 2014, going on 
to become a global pop culture 
phenomenon in the process, 
is an act of transcendence, 
something that only a handful 
of people have ever been able 
to achieve. No matter what 
might be said about Morning 
Phase, Beyoncé did something 
Beck can not do and will never 
do in his musical career. Kanye 
simply demanded that we be 
honest with ourselves and own 
up to that fact. 

Sure, 
I’ll 
concede 
that 

there 
might 
be 
something 

presumptuous about ordaining 
oneself as the universal arbiter 
of pop culture. But isn’t it 
obvious that getting caught 
up on Kanye’s egotism ignores 
the bigger picture here? Aren’t 
we missing the forest for the 
trees? And, again, he didn’t say 
anything we weren’t already 
thinking ourselves:

“I’m 
here 
to 
fight 
for 

creativity tonight,” West said. 
“That’s why I didn’t say nothing, 
but y’all knew what it meant 
when Ye walked on that stage.”

You knew what it meant, 

don’t blame him for doing it.

Not ‘The Americans’

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

If only “Allegiance” didn’t pre-

miere after “The Americans.” Ever 
since teasers first debuted on NBC 
for the George 
Nolfi-helmed 
spy 
thriller, 

comparisons 
have been made 
(in some cases 
rightly so) to 
FX’s 
critically 

acclaimed show. 
It’s 
relatively 

easy to see why 
– both shows focus on entangling 
acts of espionage between the 
United States and Russia, mainly 
through the eyes of a single fam-
ily who happens to spy for Rus-
sia. “The Americans” ’s success 
in depicting ’80s Cold War ten-
sions has created a seemingly 
insurmountable 
mountain 
for 

the modern-day “Allegiance” to 
scale. While “Allegiance” is able 
to differentiate itself from its cable 
rival, it still borrows other tropes, 
creating a straightforward, pre-
dictable product with glimmers of 
promise.

Opening with an execution by 

furnace, “Allegiance,” immedi-
ately tells viewers what to think: 
“Russians are the bad guys.” As 
sinister-looking men dressed in 
black trench coats watch a man 
be incinerated, the show draws a 
line in the sand labeling the Rus-

sians as villains on one side and 
the Americans as the good guys on 
the other. This oversimplification 
of international conflicts contrasts 
with “Allegiance” ’s more chal-
lenging family dynamic.

At the center of the show is the 

O’Connor family. The family’s only 
son, Alex (Gavin Stenhouse, “Per-
son of Interest”), is a rookie CIA 
analyst assigned to help determine 
if a Russian defector is legitimate 
or not. Likable, yet overly famil-
iar, Alex is an investigative savant 
who can read through hundreds of 
pages of information in a night and 
has expert-level knowledge about 
seemingly any subject, including 
how industrial furnaces work. 
Simultaneously, he is somewhat 
awkward and painted as an out-
sider. In short, he’s a relative run-
of-the-mill genius with a quirk or 
two that is all too common on TV. 
Alex isn’t alone in his convention-
ality, with most of the CIA charac-
ters feeling generic. This includes 
no-nonsense boss Sam Luttrell 
(Kenneth Choi, “Sons of Anar-
chy”) and tough female agent/
definite love interest Michelle 
Prado (Floriana Lima, “The Mob 
Doctor”).

However, 
unbeknownst 
to 

Alex, the majority of his fam-
ily is Russian spies. His parents, 
Russian-born Katya (Hope Davis, 
“The Newsroom”) and Mark 
(Scott Cohen, “The Carrie Dia-
ries”), an American brought in by 
Katya, are retired and want noth-

ing to do with their former lives. 
But their past comes to haunt them 
in the form of walking evil Rus-
sian archetype, Victor Dobrynin 
(Morgan 
Spector, 
“Boardwalk 

Empire”) who works for the SVR, 
the modern KGB. He insists that 
the pair recruit Alex to be a spy as 
well. When the two protest, men-
tioning a deal made years ago, Vic-
tor says there is new management: 
“They don’t care about deals made 
with the old management.” 

The dilemma faced by the 

O’Connors is the strongest part of 
the episode, as Katya and Mark try 
desperately to not bring Alex into 
a fate that has already claimed his 
older sister, Natalie (Margarita 
Levieva, “Revenge”). Natalie pres-
ents some compelling narrative 
possibilities considering her bit-
terness about the life her parents 
reluctantly forced her into, say-
ing “You move Heaven and Earth 
for Alex, what did you ever do for 
me?”

“Allegiance” goes through sev-

eral of these plot points in its pilot, 
never quite settling on one long 
enough to reach maximum effect. 
This is unfortunate, because there 
are strong sources of tension over 
what Katya and Mark should do 
and whether Alex will find out 
the truth, but they’re never given 
enough time to fully grow. Hope-
fully, as the show moves forward, 
it will allow promising threads to 
develop further and coalesce into 
a distinct identity for “Allegiance.”

does hint at 
how the uni-
verse handles 
paradoxes: by deleting the wit-
nesses. 

That’s the anthropic principle 

at work – the philosophical con-
sideration that observations of 
the physical universe must be 
compatible with the conscious life 
that observes it. This is why the 
future-version of our protagonist 
David (Jonny Weston, “Chasing 
Mavericks”) is annihilated at the 
end (beginning?), but the future-
version of the camera remains 
intact.

“Project Almanac” takes off 

in the style of “Chronicle”. It’s a 
found footage film where irre-
sponsible kids come into an 
unreasonable degree of power. 
The content of the movie is pre-
sumably found by the protago-
nists on the second iteration of 
their adventure, at the end of the 
movie.

The cast is cute. David is cut-

out geek, and his posse is equally 
“Breakfast Club.” Their group’s 
camaraderie separates “Project 
Almanac” from time travel clas-
sics like “Back To The Future”. 
For the first half of the movie, the 

whole group goes back in time 
together. The conflict arises when 
David takes it on himself to solve 
the butterfly effect consequences 
of previous time trips by himself. 

In “Butterfly Effect” (another 

time travel flick) there was a 
supernatural aspect to justify 
why everything always went 
wrong. In “Donnie Darko” there 
was only one version of actions 
Donnie could ever take, and the 
mood of the movie was predis-
posed toward metaphor rather 
than science; the prime mover of 
films like those is a supernatural 
overmind. Whereas, in “Project 
Almanac” the prime mover is the 
vulnerable protagonist himself, à 
la “Doctor Who.”

Because the time travel in 

“Project Almanac” is supposed 
to be pure sci-fi rather than some 
crystallized narrative tapped 
from overdrawn wells of Greek 
pathos and “human condition” 
pablum, there’s no scifi-compat-
ible reason for why things can’t 
actually go perfectly in this plot. 
David says there are no second 
chances, but he’s totally wrong. 

In proper wish-fulfillment time 
travel, 
there 
are 
arbitrarily 

many chances. 

The frantic jostle of a found-

footage film works well within 
the cast of Instagram-age teen-
agers, but the group’s reaction 
to finding a time machine in 
their friend’s basement doesn’t 
quite match the hugeness of 
the moment, and the pseudo-
scientific babble is transparent 
and reductive. Weston is charis-
matic enough to carry the movie 
regardless, but there are kinks, 
and they are noticeable.

Though it lacks the infectious 

magic of “Back to the Future,” 
“The Time Traveller’s Wife” 
or “Harry Potter and the Pris-
oner of Azkaban” and though 
it doesn’t mindfuck with the 
intensity of “Donnie Darko” or 
“Source Code,” this movie is 
every bit on par with “Primer,” 
“Looper” and “Groundhog Day” 
and it’s a much stronger package 
than “Chronicle.” Time travel 
movies are a special brand of 
enjoyable, and this one fits into 
the genre like a cog in a watch.

Ridiculous ‘Son’

“Seventh Son” is 
dumb fantasy 

done badly

By JACOB RICH

Daily Film Editor

Dumb fantasy, much like dumb 

action and dumb romantic com-
edy, can be a surprisingly viable 
genre 
when 

done right. In 
the age of abun-
dant blockbuster 
trash-mongers 
like Michael Bay, 
it has become 
increasingly 
apparent 
that 

stratification 
exists between the “good” (“Pacif-
ic Rim,” “Live Die Repeat: Edge of 
Tomorrow”) and “bad” (“Trans-
formers,” “Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles”) popcorn movies. “Sev-
enth Son,” based on a UK young-
adult fantasy novel, is a shining 
example of the latter, a soulless 
fantasy/action movie that seems 
to have spent its $95 million bud-
get in somehow convincing Oscar-
nominated actors Jeff Bridges 
(“True Grit”) and Julianne Moore 
(“Still Alice”) to grace it with their 
presence.

Of that we can never be sure, 

but it certainly seems evident that 
very little money went towards 
the film’s CGI. “Seventh Son” has 
blurry, muddy visual effects, the 
kind that aren’t concerned with 
the viewer catching its imperfec-
tions. This philosophy of hiding 
mediocre filmmaking pervades 
many aspects of “Seventh Son,” 
especially in the film’s terrible 
fight choreography, which is most-
ly hidden by close-ups and a shaky 
camera. Even though the film’s 
post-production team clearly did 

its best to make “Seventh Son” pre-
sentable, the ugly parts of the film 
frequently stick out; for example, 
a Chewbacca-esque Orc charac-
ter’s terrible mask and makeup are 
barely veiled by a layer of CGI, and 
the “magical” death animation for 
several witch characters seems 
(unintentionally) slightly different 
each time one dies.

The only thing the film is con-

cerned with is lead actor Ben 
Barnes’s (“The Chronicles of Nar-
nia: Prince Caspian”) face. His 
stupid, dumb Hollister-ass face. 
And his mysteriously Southern 
Californian accent (especially for 
a British actor). A farm boy who 
becomes a knight’s apprentice 
thanks to a prophecy or some-
thing, Ben Barnes’s Tom Ward is 
without a doubt the least interest-
ing film protagonist in the history 
of fantasy movies. 

Magic amulet. Evil witches that 

turn into dragons. Witch hunt-
er Jeff Bridges. That’s the plot, 
explained with equal effort and 
ambition as the film’s script puts 
forth. 

You’d think the addition of Kit 

Harington (“Game of Thrones”), 
a seasoned veteran of onscreen 

medieval brooding, would at least 
somewhat compensate for direc-
tor Sergei Bodrov’s choice to cast 
a department store mannequin 
as the protagonist. Instead, he 
dies in the first five minutes of the 
film. The fourth billed cast mem-
ber dies in the first five minutes 
of the movie. Harington’s casting 
is an act of pure deception to lure 
“Game of Thrones” fans into this 
trainwreck. Don’t be fooled. 

Jeff 
Bridges 
and 
Julianne 

Moore are awful. Moore acts like 
the film is a dental appointment; 
Bridges at least has more fun with 
it, but still doesn’t put in any real 
acting, instead hamming it up with 
exaggerated mouth movement and 
a bizarre accent that’s part Gan-
dalf, part Bane, all terrible.

According to numerous online 

sources, the film is a very loose 
adaptation of the novel it’s based 
on, so it didn’t even get that right. 

The best thing that can be said 

about this film is that it has a quick 
pace and a short length. 

Yet, “Seventh Son” has been 

given a “D-” instead of an “F” 
because dragons and swords and 
stuff are still pretty cool things to 
put in movies.

“I need a shower soooo bad, dude.”

The best and worst 
of Grammys fashion

By Daily Style Writers

BEST:
Pharrell: 
Besides 
nabbing 

three statuettes Sunday night, 
Pharrell exercised his recent 
collection of Adidas, a crisp gray 
shorts suit — one in which he 
could probably exercise. Though 
nothing revelatory at first blush, 
when a light hits it, the suit’s 
grey goes white, matching his 
suede, buck lace-ups. Williams 
doesn’t need the Smokey Bear 
hat to distinguish himself: An 
Adidas collab, an unadulterated 
eye for color and accolades that 
never stop raining will suffice 
for now.

 — Andrew McClure
Aloe 
Blacc: 
Though 
Aloe 

Blacc’s 
music 
contributions 

have been afterthought-ish for 
a few years now, the 36-year-
old hyphenate still swags out, 
leaving any flaws at home. On 
the carpet, he teamed up with an 
indie fashion label to rock a rich 
navy suit, complete with a snow-
white pocket square to light up 
his shirt. Some think the south-
of-knee taper is key on the pants, 
but Blacc opts for the slim-cut, 
straight leg, which barely kiss 
his baby-blue suede loafers. 
Smart. A blacked-out pork pie 
cap levels out the vibrancy of 
everything below. 

— Andrew McClure
Kanye West: Kanye doesn’t 

smile in photographs because 
people “back then” didn’t. Even 
his nearly punking Beck for the 
artist’s Album of the Year win 
wasn’t funny. What is funny is 
that Ye seldom looks like shit, 
and when he “does,” you always 
end up commending his almost-

transgressive 
look. 
He 

wended down the carpet, chin 
up, tits out, in a clean velvet 
Balmain suit. Bespoke to his 
distinctive taste, the pant legs 
stack, unstreamlined, like the 
money he made from Yeezus. 
A gilded necklace and velvet 
cowboy boots — Ye likes boots 
— say, “I only need one color to 
trump all of yours, bitch.”

 — Andrew McClure
Beyoncé: Two things I know 

for certain: 1. Bey is impossible 
of looking anything other than 
flawless. 2. If anyone’s going 
to convince us all to convert to 
veganism, it’s her. This form of 
human head-to-toe perfection 
is high-key scary at this point, 
but when her goddess-like body 
is donning a beaded, custom, 
body-hugging Proenza Schouler 
gown, it’s clear we’ve found the 
eighth world wonder. Long live 
the queen. 

— Caroline Filips
Gwen 
Stefani: 
Thankfully, 

Gwen has graduated from the 
days of donning Harajuku on the 
red carpet, and it’s a beautiful 
thing — especially when it 
led her to an Atelier Versace 
jumpsuit. Harem-style bottoms 
and a ruffled bustier only added 
to her edgy style repertoire, but 
it’s clear she’s taking a more 
refined, minimalist approach. 
The little black jumpsuit is on 
the rise, people. 

— Caroline Filips
Taylor Swift: As a perpetual 

skeptic of the high-low trend, 
Taylor 
took 
a 
unique 
spin 

on it with a teal, halter mini 
dress within a ball gown that 
converted me into a full-fledged 
believer. Elie Saab is always 
perfectly feminine and elegant, 
and when it’s topped off with 
Lorraine Schwartz — killing 
it. 

— Caroline Filips

Kim 
Kardashian 
West: 

Hair and makeup alone, Kim 
Kardashian 
owned 
the 
red 

carpet. But then, she slipped on 
her robe and she stole the show. 
And by robe I mean golden-
sequined Jean Paul Gaultier 
Haute 
Couture 
gown. 
Kim 

was too petite for the dress; it 
would have looked better on say, 
Beyoncé, but it also wasn’t black, 
so Mrs. West gets major kudos. 
She was the best shiny, gold thing 
Kanye could hold since he didn’t 
walk away with a Grammy. 

— Mara MacLean
Childish Gambino: The men 

definitely surpassed the women 
this Grammy season and the 
male forerunner was none other 
than Donald Glover. His tux was 
tailored to perfection, matching 
his optimal amount of facial hair. 
Glover’s cuff stopped just above 
the ankle to accentuate his sharp 
slippers. The ladies need to step 
up their game in order to keep up 
with ’Bino. 

— Mara MacLean
John 
Mayer: 
Mr. 
Mayer 

looked as dapper as can be on 
the Grammy red carpet. When 
he started playing the guitar in 
the same getup, you could hear 
swoons. He paired a classic 
tuxedo, though a little shiny, with 
a great bowtie. His tortoiseshell 
glasses 
and 
sweeping 
‘do 

completed the look, completely 
outshining Katy Perry. 

— Mara MacLean
WORST:
Nick Jonas: I don’t listen to 

Nick Jonas and, to be frank, I 
thought he was part of the Naked 
Brothers Band for like, well, 
until yesterday. And because the 
Internet is big I am probably not 
the first to say he embarrassed 
himself last night, in a plaid 
Versace suit with blinding white 
high-top kicks. First, Versace 
sucks. 
Their 
ready-to-wear 

menswear line, in all of its gold-
jewelry-printed-on-a-bomber-
only-$3K!-ness, is by and large 
meant for one of two people — a 
Saudi prince who discovered 

high fashion today or a not-
real person. There’s a stark line 
between 
sartorial 
risk-taking 

and 
wearing 
expensive 
shit 

because it’s expensive and the 
creative directors must “know 
what they’re doing.” Jonas, tsk. 
 — Andrew McClure

Sam Smith: Sam Smith won 

four Grammys this year. I have 
a hunch that these shows are 
scripted enough for Smith to 
know that he was going to surely 
win at least two awards last night, 
so I expected more out of him. 
His sort-of-annoying pompadour 
aside, his sharp Armani tux had 
potential, but all went to hell 
when his white bowtie existed 
and his shirt cuffs nearly hit his 
southernmost thumb knuckle, 
like me in my dad’s swag back 
at the homecoming dance. I 
liked the stacked-leg, tapered-
below-knee 
pants,w 
but 
his 

Lego-like hyper-glossed Oxford 
lace-ups make me want to chuck 
my phone. I did. 

— Andrew McClure
LL Cool J: I remember when 

someone, for the first time, 
mentioned LL Cool J, and me 
asking, “So what’s his real stage 
name?” The name hasn’t gotten 
any cooler, even if he is hosting 
music’s “biggest” night for the 
fourth time. The moment I saw 
that he and Seacrest were wearing 
the 
same 
Armani 
made-to-

measure suit, I was disappointed 
in Seacrest, unfazed by LL Cool 
J. In an electric, navy suit jacket 
with black lapels, black trousers 
and his typical limo-driver lid, 
things got worse with a droopy, 
oversized Mickey Mouse bowtie. 
I’m convinced that hue of blue 
looks good on nobody, except 
maybe the store rack. It’s a good 
home for any style piece not 
worth exposing to your friend, 
let alone millions of wine-sipping 
judges in their living rooms. 

— Andrew McClure
Madonna: So Madonna is 

definitely having a midlife crisis 
as seen right on the Grammys’s 
red carpet last night. Dressed in 
a Givenchy trainwreck, she tried 
to embrace her inner cabaret/
yodeler/naughty maid and it 
was an epic fail. Madonna, you 
are 56 years old (the age of my 
grandmother), for the love of all 
that is right in the fashion world 
please dress appropriately for 
your age. 

— Mariam Sheikh
Rihanna: RiRi showed up on 

the carpet in a huge, pink, poofy 
disaster of proportions that I 
have not seen since I played with 
princess barbies. However, she 
redeemed herself during the 
awards when she skipped the 
pink ruffles and went for a more 
sleek and cool look, a black pant 
suit. Sometimes you just can’t 
win ‘em all RiRi. 

— Mariam Sheikh
Katherine 
McPhee: 
Maybe 

cutting your own hair works 
for 
you, 
Kath, 
but 
please 

refrain 
from 
cutting 
your 

dresses … and please, please 
#StopRandomMetalBars2k15. 

— Caroline Filips
Iggy Azalea: I too questioned, 

“who dat?” at first glance of 
Ms. Azalea herself, but was 
confused as to why one of the 
von Trapp children would be at 
the Grammys. Iggy, you can wear 
anything, but please, check the 
mane. 

— Caroline Filips
Charli XCX: Moschino is hard 

to get right on the red carpet, 
and unfortunately Charli XCX’s 
attempt was a failure. Her white 
tuxedo looked like it could use a 
good steam, and her red carpet 
stance did not work well with 
the sheen. The hair and makeup 
added to the pink bowtie and 
fur; it all had a very Alice in 
Wonderland feel, somewhere 
between the Mad Hatter and 
White Rabbit. 

— Mara MacLean
Katy Perry: Perry’s hair and 

makeup were all wrong, from the 
lavender tresses to cat eyeliner. 
Her 
nude, 
beaded 
Zuhair 

Murad dress appeared ill-fitted 
and hit a really bad part of the 
leg. It was interesting and eye-
catching, but not necessarily 
for the right reasons. The dress 
was stunning, as is Perry, but 
it didn’t come together this 
time.

Ten women and 

two men to serve as 
jurors for the trial 

STEPHENVILLE, 
TEXAS 

(AP) — Carl A jury was seated 
Monday in the trial of a man 
charged with killing the for-
mer Navy SEAL depicted in the 
Oscar-nominated movie “Amer-
ican Sniper,” after extra efforts 
to keep publicity about the case 
and the movie from preventing 
a fair trial.

Ten women and two men 

will serve as jurors for the 
trial of Eddie Ray Routh start-
ing Wednesday. Routh, a for-
mer Marine, is charged with 
capital murder in the deaths 
of 38-year-old Chris Kyle and 
Kyle’s friend, 35-year-old Chad 
Littlefield. Opening statements 
are Wednesday.

The movie based on Kyle’s 

memoir as a celebrated sniper 
who served four tours in Iraq 
has grossed nearly $300 mil-
lion. In response to the attention 
paid to the Kyle case, officials 
called in more than four times 
as many potential jurors as they 
would for a regular trial.

The county’s top prosecu-

tor and the judge overseeing 
the case both told prospective 
jurors they would only insist 
that jurors who have seen the 
movie or read the book set their 
prior knowledge aside when 
they hear evidence. The movie 
ends with a depiction of Kyle 
meeting Routh, followed by 
footage from Kyle’s funeral.

“It’s hard not to have knowl-

edge of this case,” Erath County 
District Attorney Alan Nash 
said. “It’s pervasive.”

Nash asked potential jurors 

Monday morning if they were 

unable to set aside what they’d 
already heard. No one among 
about 130 potential jurors in 
court raised their hand.

State District Judge Jason 

Cashon estimated that no more 
than two dozen potential jurors 
had been dismissed from serv-
ing due to pretrial publicity. 
Cashon denied defense motions 
to delay the trial or move it to a 
different county.

Routh’s attorneys plan to 

pursue an insanity defense. 
Prosecutors won’t seek the 
death penalty. He faces life in 
prison without parole if con-
victed.

Family members have said 

Routh, 27, struggled with post-
traumatic stress disorder after 
leaving the Marines in 2010. 
The small arms technician 
served in Iraq and was deployed 
to earthquake-ravaged Haiti. 
Kyle took Routh to the shoot-

ing range after Routh’s mother 
asked if he could help her son.

Kyle made more than 300 

kills as a sniper for SEAL Team 
3, according to his own count 
and earned two Silver Stars for 
valor. After leaving the military, 
Kyle volunteered with veterans 
facing mental health problems, 
often taking them shooting.

About two hours after Kyle, 

Littlefield and Routh arrived at 
Rough Creek Lodge and Resort 
on Feb. 2, 2013, an employee dis-
covered the bodies of Kyle and 
Littlefield at the remote range.

Authorities say Routh drove 

to his sister’s house in Kyle’s 
truck, telling her and her hus-
band that he had killed Kyle and 
Littlefield.

His sister told police that 

Routh “was out of his mind, 
saying people were sucking his 
soul and that he could smell the 
pigs.”

Both candidates 
wish to benefit the 
wealthy, according 
to opposition party

WASHINGTON (AP) — Mitt 

Romney opposed the govern-
ment’s rescue of U.S. automakers. 
So did Jeb Bush.

Both worked in finance and 

backed the Wall Street bailout. 
Both are advocates of tax cuts 
that Democrats contend only ben-
efit the wealthy and big business.

While the first actual votes of 

the next presidential campaign 
may be a year away, Democrats 
already are drawing such com-
parisons between the former 
Florida governor and the GOP’s 
2012 White House nominee — 
and they don’t consider them flat-
tering.

Democrats 
are 
unwilling 

to let Bush define himself as a 
reformer who aims to close the 
gap between the rich and poor, so 
they are trying to paint him as this 
campaign’s Romney. The ex-Mas-
sachusetts governor struggled 
in 2012 against criticism related 
to his work in private equity and 

his portrayal by President Barack 
Obama’s allies as a cold-hearted 
plutocrat.

“We don’t need to try to show 

that Jeb is like Romney. He pretty 
much is Romney,” said Eddie Vale, 
vice president of American Bridge 
21st Century, a liberal group set 
up to conduct opposition research 
on Republicans. “When it comes 
to any ideas or policies, he’s the 
same as Romney.”

That line of criticism was 

noticeable this past week after 
Bush gave his first major policy 
speech as a potential presiden-
tial candidate. His remarks to the 
Detroit Economic Club empha-
sized an upbeat economic mes-
sage and touched on overhauling 
the nation’s immigration system 
and trying to improve the lives of 
children underserved by public 
schools.

Democrats countered by cir-

culating the transcript of a 2012 
interview in which Bush cited his 
opposition to the auto bailout. In 
the interview, Bush said the auto 
rescue, a key issue in Michigan, 
was “driven by politics” and he 
noted the Obama administration’s 
role in shuttering car dealerships 
and providing the United Auto 
Workers union with an equity 

stake in Chrysler.

Obama’s team successfully 

used that bailout as a wedge 
against Romney in Michigan 
and Ohio, repeatedly referring 
to a 2008 Romney op-ed with 
the headline, “Let Detroit Go 
Bankrupt.” Although Romney 
did not write the headline and 
advocated a managed bankrupt-
cy for the industry, it created the 
impression that he was willing 
to forgo thousands of U.S. auto 
jobs.

Bush’s early approach to his 

potential campaign signals a 
desire to avoid such pitfalls, as 
well as Romney’s most notable 
gaffe — his behind-closed-door 
dismissal of the “47 percent” of 
Americans who, he said, don’t pay 
income taxes. 

Lisa Wagner, Romney’s 2012 

Midwest fundraising director, 
said that once voters meet Bush, 
“they see his head and his heart 
are connected” and they are “very, 
very taken” with his “sincerity.”

During a question-and-answer 

session after the Detroit speech, 
Bush said losing his first bid for 
Florida governor in 1994 taught 
him that winning campaigns 
requires building an emotional 
attachment with voters. 

Forensic report 
shows blunt force 
injury to the neck 

 HOUSTON (AP) — An 

autopsy has found that a metal 
disc from a defective air bag 
sliced into a Texas man’s neck 
and killed him after a low-
speed car accident last month 
near Houston.

The Harris County Insti-

tute 
of 
Forensic 
Sciences 

concluded that Carlos Solis 
had suffered no other serious 
injuries, and his death was 
accidental. The report, which 
became public late last week, 
listed the cause of death as 
blunt-force injuries to the 
neck.

Solis, 35, a father of two, 

died Jan. 18 in the Houston 
suburb of Spring. His 2002 
Honda Accord had a driver’s 
air bag made by Takata Corp. 
of Japan. Those can inflate 
with too much force, causing 
them to blow apart a metal 
inflator canister and send 
shrapnel into the passenger 
compartment.

Solis is among six people 

killed and 64 injured by the 
inflator mechanisms, which 
have caused the recalls of 19 
million vehicles worldwide 
and touched off investigations 
by the U.S. Justice Depart-
ment and safety regulators.

Takata 
offered 
condo-

lences to Solis’ family and 
said it’s committed to work-
ing with the U.S. government 

and automakers to “take all 
actions needed to promote 
public safety.” Honda offered 
its condolences, saying it is 
“currently in communication 
with representatives of the 
family in an effort to further 
investigate the situation and 
to address their concerns.”

The white metal disc was 

2¾ inches in diameter and 
weighed 
about 
13 
ounces, 

according to the report. It 
caused a gaping cut in Solis’ 
neck that severed an artery 
and vein. “Appearance con-
sisted of a slightly distorted 
air bag inflator component,” 
the report stated. The disc 
lodged in the right side of 
Solis’ neck near his shoulder, 
according to the report.

Pictures 
of 
the 
crash 

showed it did little damage to 
the left front bumper, fender 
and hood of Solis’ car.

Solis bought the car in April 

from an independent dealer in 
the Houston area. It was part 
of 2011 recall to fix a defec-
tive driver’s air bag inflator, 
but neither the dealer nor 
two previous owners had the 
recall repairs done. Honda 
has said it mailed recall noti-
fication letters to a previous 
owner of the Accord starting 
in 2011, but it had not yet sent 
a letter to Solis. The company 
urged anyone with a vehicle 
recalled for air bag problems 
to take the cars to dealers as 
soon as possible.

Solis’ 
family 
is 
suing 

Honda, Takata and the dealer 
who sold Solis the car.

American views 
have improved 

slightly, according 
to recent poll finds 

WASHINGTON 
(AP) 
— 

Americans’ views of Presi-
dent Barack Obama have 
improved slightly in the past 
two months, and opinions 
are more positive about the 
direction of the country and 
the health of the economy, 
an 
Associated 
Press-GfK 

poll finds.

A 
slim 
majority 
now 

approves of the way Obama 
is 
handling 
unemploy-

ment, according to the poll, 
conducted before Friday’s 
release 
of 
a 
surprisingly 

strong jobs report.

Forty-seven 
percent 
of 

those surveyed approve of 
how Obama is doing his job, 
compared with 41 percent 
in December, and 51 percent 
approve of his handling of 
unemployment, 
compared 

with 44 percent before.

Nearly half say the econ-

omy is good now, while 41 
percent 
thought 
that 
in 

December. 
In 
December 

2013, only one-third called 
the economy good.

Approval 
of 
the 
way 

Obama is handling the econ-
omy improved slightly, 41 
percent to 45 percent, over 
the past two months.

Friday’s 
report 
showed 

that U.S. employers added 
257,000 
jobs 
in 
January, 

and the average hourly wage 
grew by 12 cents to $24.75, 
the biggest gain since Sep-
tember 2008. Hourly pay has 
increased 2.2 percent in the 
past year.

“We’ve come a long way 

these past six years since we 
suffered the worst financial 
crisis since the Great Depres-
sion,” Obama said Friday in 

Indianapolis. “In 2014, our 
economy created more than 
3.1 million jobs, and that’s 
the best year of job growth 
since 
the 
1990s,” 
adding 

that “America is poised for 
another good year.”

Despite the increase in 

jobs, the unemployment rate 
rose to 5.7 percent from 5.6 
percent, 
largely 
because 

more people began look-
ing for jobs. An increase in 
the number of job hunters 
can indicate that people are 
more confident in their abil-
ity to find work, even if the 
official unemployment rate 
goes up.

But people still feel that 

their own recovery is lag-
ging, the poll shows, with 
only 35 percent saying their 
own family has completely 
or mostly recovered from 
economic downturn.

Just 27 percent see the 

job market where they live 
as being most of the way to 
recovery, far less than the 
number that thinks big busi-
nesses (55 percent) and the 
stock market (53 percent) 
have bounced all the way 
back.

People also fear the pos-

sibility of another down-
turn. 
Three-quarters 
say 

the government has not put 
the right rules and regula-
tions in place to stop another 
recession from occurring.

Obama has been keen to 

take credit for the improving 
economic landscape, arguing 
that new financial regula-
tions, an early boost in gov-
ernment spending and the 
bailout of the auto industry 
under his watch were essen-
tial to the recovery.

Economic 
concerns 

remain at the top of Ameri-
cans’ minds, the AP-GfK 
poll shows, with 9 in 10 call-
ing the economy a very or 
extremely important issue, 
significantly more than any 

other issue asked about in 
the poll.

The poll finds that people 

are slightly more likely to 
trust Democrats than Repub-
licans on handling economic 
issues, 33 percent to 28 per-
cent.

Improving views of the 

president also came with a 
small increase in the per-
centage 
that 
thinks 
the 

country is headed in the 
right direction — 39 percent 
compared with 33 percent in 
December.

Much of that improvement 

was among Democrats, two-
thirds of whom now think 
the country is headed in the 
right 
direction. 
Improved 

ratings 
among 
Democrats 

appeared to boost Obama’s 
approval rating.

Bolstered by lower unem-

ployment, greater consumer 
confidence and evidence of 
a rise in his approval rat-
ings, Obama has made an 
aggressive start to his final 
two years in office even 
after 
November’s 
elec-

tions gave control of Con-
gress to Republicans. The 
White House hopes a stron-
ger recovery gives Obama 
the credibility to confront 
Republicans with his own 
economic pitch.

In spite of growing opti-

mism 
about 
politics 
and 

the economy, 8 in 10 people 
questioned have little con-
fidence 
that 
Obama 
and 

Republicans in Congress can 
work together to solve the 
country’s problems.

Americans 
blame 
both 

sides 
for 
the 
perceived 

impasse. About half thinks 
Obama doesn’t compromise 
enough 
with 
Republicans 

to get things done, while 6 
in 10 say Republicans don’t 
compromise 
enough 
with 

Obama. Fewer than 2 in 10 
think either side compro-
mises too much.

WATER POLO
‘M’ finishes 3-1 on weekend

By JESSE KLEIN

Daily Sports Writer

This 
weekend’s 
Triton 

Invitational in San Diego put 
the Michigan women’s water 
polo team in many different 
situations, 
allowing 
coach 

Marcelo Leonardi to see how 
his team would respond. And it 
responded well.

The Wolverines proved they 

were ready for high-pressure 
situations 
in 
their 
second 

tournament of the season by 
winning games in overtime, 
coming from behind and holding 
onto one-goal leads.

The weekend started out rough 

with a loss to No. 15 Long Beach 
State, 6-5, in the closing seconds. 
Junior attacker Ali Thomason 
scored a hat trick, but her feat 
wasn’t enough for the Wolverines 
to win. The game wasn’t a total 
loss, however, according to senior 
goalkeeper Emily Browning.

“Even though Long Beach State 

didn’t go the way we wanted, it 
was a good close game,” Browning 
said. “It’s good preparation for the 
tough games we will be seeing 
later in the season.”

Losing the first game of a 

tournament by one could have 
weighed down the morale of a 
team. Leonardi saw his team 
come back with extra motivation, 
proceeding to win all of the 
remaining games. They downed 
Cal State East Bay, 10-5, as 
freshman 
attacker 
Caroline 

Anderson followed Thomas’ lead 
and completed her first hat trick.

Attacking and goal scoring has 

not been a problem for Michigan 
so far, as the Wolverines have 
averaged eight goals per game. 
However, their defensive play 
has been confused and sporadic, 
with the new system imposed by 
Leonardi only now starting to 
click after four months of work. 
This tournament showed vast 
improvement on defense of the 
Wolverines.

“We were finally all on the 

same page,” Leonardi said. “We 
are trusting each other and the 
system.”

After dominating the Pioneers, 

Leonardi 
got 
to 
experience 

another 
novel 
situation, 
an 

overtime win. No. 16 UC Davis 
came back from an early 3-1 deficit 
to tie the game at nine. Browning 
held off the the Aggies’ attack, 
making double-digit saves. She 
cited the cohesiveness of her and 
her teammates for the success.

The weekend came to a close 

with a come-from-behind win 
against No. 18 UC Santa Barbara. 
Michigan trailed 1-0 after the 
first quarter and 3-2 at the half, 
but in keeping with the weekend’s 
previous 
performances, 
the 

Wolverines fought against the 
odds, winning 6-4.

“We learned that even if we 

are down by a couple goals, we 
can still get back in the game and 
come out with a win,” Browning 
said.

Bigs use size advantage

Doyle, Donnal 
combine for 22 
points on 8-for-9 

shooting vs. Indiana

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team matched up 
Sunday with an Indiana team 
that was more athletic with 
better shooters and probably 
quicker as well.

But the Hoosiers weren’t 

bigger. And it’s a rare day when 
the Wolverines can say that.

Though Michigan fell short in 

the end, both freshman forward 
Ricky 
Doyle 
and 
redshirt 

freshman forward Mark Donnal 
turned in strong performances 
at 
the 
‘5’ 
position. 
Doyle 

finished with 15 points and six 
rebounds, while Donnal added 
seven points, including an early 
3-pointer that helped keep the 
Wolverines afloat at Assembly 
Hall.

Sunday was just the fourth 

time this season, and the second 
since Nov. 17, that multiple 
big men scored at least seven 
points each. Michigan also had 
significant size advantages in 
each of the previous occasions: 
Nov. 15 against Hillsdale, Nov. 
17 against Bucknell and Dec. 22 
against Coppin State.

“It was good to see them being 

productive,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach John Beilein. “Ricky really 
gave us a lot of good minutes out 
there. Mark was coming in after 
the sickness, and we wanted to 
really give him a shot, and he 
made the most of it in the second 
half.”

The success down low came 

after a 72-54 home loss to Iowa 
on Thursday in which Doyle, 

Donnal and senior Max Bielfeldt 
combined for just four points 
and five rebounds on 1-for-4 
shooting.

The Wolverines reaped the 

benefits of playing one of the 
smallest teams in the Big Ten. 
While Michigan ranks below 
average at No. 195 nationally 
in effective height, a height 
measure weighted based on 
playing time, Indiana is even 
further down at No. 260.

With junior forward Hanner 

Mosquera-Perea 
limited 
to 

four 
minutes 
by 
an 
ankle 

injury, Indiana started 6-foot-
7, 215-pound sophomore Collin 
Hartman at the ‘5.’ Freshmen 
Max Hoetzel (6-foot-8, 220) 
and Emmitt Holt (6-foot-7, 225) 
spelled Hartman, but the three 
Michigan big men were bigger 
than all three of their Indiana 
counterparts.

So 
the 
Wolverines 
got 

unexpected 
production 
from 

their frontcourt, which has been 
competitive but not consistent 
this season. Doyle, Donnal and 
Bielfeldt have not been immune 
to the midseason spell of injuries 
and illnesses. Donnal played just 
two minutes Thursday against 
Iowa and missed the previous 
two games with an illness, and 
Doyle hadn’t scored in double 
figures since Jan. 10 as he battled 
an upper respiratory infection.

“With their total numbers, 

they were really good today,” 
Beilein said. “And I loved that 
Mark could come in and get 
the offensive rebounds. Once 
again, (Indiana is) not a great 
rebounding team, but it is a step 
for us to go, and (for) Ricky to get 
the rebounds.

“When people switch screens, 

like they do, we weren’t going to 
do anything else. We were just 
going to throw it to those two 
guys as much as we could. We 
would like to have more success, 

but they’re making big steps.”

When the Wolverines lost 

junior guard Caris LeVert and 
sophomore 
guard 
Derrick 

Walton Jr. to foot injuries last 
month, among the production 
they lost was 3-point shooting. 
LeVert and Walton were two of 
the team’s top three long-range 
shooters, so in recent weeks, 
Michigan has had to redirect the 
game plan to penetration and 
paint touches.

Sunday, that meant finding 

Doyle 
and 
Donnal, 
who 

combined to shoot 8-for-9 from 
the floor.

“I was just doing what I’ve 

practiced — using my leverage, 
keeping the ball high, just score 
the easy bucket,” Doyle said.

That easy bucket might not 

be as easy when the Wolverines 
face Illinois, Michigan State and 
Ohio State in their next three 
games, but they continue to 
reshape their offensive attack 
to rely more on getting the ball 
inside.

“In 
the 
Michigan 
State 

game, we scored two points a 
possession when we put two 
feet in the paint,” Beilein said. 
“We’ve been working on this in 
practice, driving the ball. We 
have a lot of shooters that aren’t 
shot-fakers or drive-fakers.”

That won’t change overnight, 

and the size advantage will 
disappear soon as well. But 
Michigan’s crop of big men 
put on a much-needed show of 
strength when given the chance 
Sunday.

Nagelvoort thriving 
in latest opportunity

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Writer

For much of the season, it 

hasn’t seemed to matter who is 
in net for the Michigan hockey 
team.

The 12th-ranked Wolverines 

have scored more goals than any 
team in the country, but behind 
the 
curtain 

of goals lies 
a 
problem 

that concerns even one of the 
nation’s hottest teams. Despite 
having won 14 of 17 games, 
Michigan 
has 
struggled 
to 

find consistent play from its 
goaltenders: sophomore Zach 
Nagelvoort and junior Steve 
Racine.

In the past three games, 

however, Nagelvoort has looked 
as good as he has at any time this 
season, bringing some much-
needed stability to a team in 
the midst of an eight-game road 
stretch.

After making 31 saves to 

earn the win in net Saturday, 
Nagelvoort is now 6-2-0 in 
Big Ten play. He sports a 
conference-leading 1.74 goals-
against average and .938 save 
percentage in eight conference 
games. Since returning to the 
starting role two weeks ago, the 
sophomore is surrendering just 
one goal per game, earning the 
starting gig for now.

“It’s 
been 
a 
big 
debate 

just about every week,” said 
Michigan coach Red Berenson. 
“Racine started to lose his 
focus or gain a little bit of (over)
confidence, so we put Zach in 
there, and his next start is a 
shutout (against Wisconsin on 
Jan. 24). If you look at his last 
three games, it’s pretty good on 
the goals-against side. We were 
giving up four goals a game 

(before).

“I like both of them, but right 

now, Zach’s in a good spot.”

While Nagelvoort has the job 

for now, this season indicates 
that in goal, one’s job security 
is only as good as their last 
performance. For Nagelvoort, 
this means he has to carry a 
consistent mentality regardless 
of position.

“I always approach games 

like I’m going to play them, 
whether I’m the starter or not,” 
Nagelvoort said. “I feel like 
in my position, you have to be 
prepared to go every single night 
as we’ve seen. You never know 
when you’re going to get thrown 
in there.”

WINDY CITY PIPELINE?: 

There was a lot to be excited 
about in Michigan’s win over 
Michigan State, but beyond the 
experience of an outdoor game, 
Berenson is hoping for one long-
term benefit of the trip.

With nine Big Ten players 

from the Chicago area and 
more than 40 playing Division 
I hockey nationwide, the Windy 
City has become something 
of a hockey hotbed in recent 
years. The surge is especially 
intriguing given that no team 
calls Chicago home, with Notre 
Dame (96 miles) the closest 
team.

Sophomore 
forward 
JT 

Compher 
and 
freshman 

defenseman Sam Piazza have 
come from Chicago to Ann 
Arbor, and Berenson hopes a 
big win at Soldier Field can help 
that contingent grow down the 
road.

“I think it’s huge for us,” he 

said. “We’ve had some good 
players from Chicago before we 
were even in the Big Ten, we 
have some now, and hopefully 
we are going to get more.”

Michigan travels to Columbus 
for second rivalry showdown

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Writer

Tuesday’s game against Ohio 

State will be the Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team’s 

fourth contest in 10 days.

With the addition of two 

teams to the conference, not 
only 
do 
the 

Wolverines 
have to combat 
a 
fatiguing 

schedule, 
but 
also 
a 

much 
more 

competitive 
one.

“We played 

two less games 
in the Big Ten 
last 
year,” 

said Michigan 
coach 
Kim 

Barnes Arico. “You go and add 
Maryland, who’s No. 5 in the 
country, and Rutgers, who’s 
a top-20 team in the country, 
to our league, and we have to 
play them three times. So that 
drastically changes what we 
had to do last year. … I think the 
NCAA committee will take that 
into consideration.”

But it won’t be challenging 

for Michigan (6-6 Big Ten, 14-9 

overall) to find the energy it needs 
to put up a fight in Columbus, 
despite obvious fatigue.

On top of being a major 

rivalry game for the Wolverines, 
when the teams met on Jan. 
11, the Wolverines edged out 
the Buckeyes (8-4, 16-8) in 
an overtime thriller, 100-94. 
Michigan pulled out a win by 
holding the nation’s leading 
scorer, guard Kelsey Mitchell, to 
just 13 points.

For a player who averages 25.5 

points per game, Mitchell was 
largely shut down by Michigan’s 
defense.

Unfortunately 
for 
the 

Buckeyes, that defense is as 
strong as it has been all season. 
In Sunday’s loss to Rutgers, 
defense was the only thing that 
kept the Wolverines in the game. 
Michigan shot just 26 percent 
from the field, but its zone 
formation held Rutgers to just 57 
points, a dramatic improvement 
from when the Scarlet Knights 
dropped 81 on Michigan in their 
first matchup on Jan. 7.

Mitchell will have to find a 

way around senior forwards 
Cyesha 
Goree 
and 
Nicole 

Elmblad. Both shut Mitchell 
down, and led the Wolverines in 
rebounds, grabbing 19 and nine, 

respectively. With their help, 
Michigan outrebounded Ohio 
State, 45-31.

After coming so close to 

victory, it’s safe to assume that 
Mitchell and the Buckeyes will 
be set on revenge in Columbus 
after leaving Ann Arbor as 
losers. Additionally, a large part 
of the earlier loss was because of 
Ohio State’s lack of experience, 
and the Buckeyes will be better 
prepared this time around.

Michigan’s biggest problem 

is still its road woes. The 
Wolverines have just a 2-6 
record away from Crisler Center 
and can’t seem to get open shots 
to fall while on the road. If they 
want to have any hope of a win 
in Columbus, none of Michigan’s 
three leading scorers — Goree, 
freshman 
guard 
Katelynn 

Flaherty 
and 
senior 
guard 

Shannon Smith — can afford to 
take the night off.

Goree, Flaherty and Smith all 

scored in double digits against 
the Buckeyes in January, with 
the most notable performance 
going to Smith, who scored a 
career-high 36 points.

Michigan made a marked 

improvement against Rutgers 
this week, and it hopes to do the 
same against Ohio State.
