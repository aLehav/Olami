Fundraising efforts
likely to coincide
with bicentennial
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Editor in Chief
After raising $3.2 billion
through the Michigan Differ-
ence capital campaign from
2004 to 2008, officials are start-
ing to plan the University's next
major fundraising program.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman, Provost Philip
Hanlon and other officials,
in conjunction with deans of
schools and colleges at the Uni-
versity, are currently in the pro-
cess of establishing campaign
goals that fulfill their vision for
the University as it moves into
its third century.
"We're not ready to launch or
anything like that, but we're in
the planning phase. We're talk-
ing to our deans, we're trying
to identify the needs," Coleman
said in an interview with The
Michigan Daily last month.
Jerry May, the University's
vice president for development,

explained that a capital cam-
paign is essentially "fundrais-
ing on steroids." Tom Baird, the
executive director of the cam-
paign, added that while the Uni-
versity continuously fundraises,
a campaign provides more sus-
tained and nuanced fundraising
efforts.
"Year in and year out, we
raise money, but there's always
needs. What a campaign does
is it really focuses you and revs
everyone up and sustains us
and provides a context to raise
money for more sp'ecific goals,"
Baird said.
The construction of 22 new
campus buildings was financed
by money raised from the
Michigan Difference campaign,
including now-iconic campus
fixtures such as the Ross School
of Business building, the Ford
School of Public Policy's Weill
Hall and the new C.S. Mott
Children's and Von Voigtlander
Women's Hospital.
Also, the Michigan Difference
funded 1,969 new scholarships
and 185 new professorships.
While the University hasn't
released the specific date that

Cancer clinics, infusions,
radiology and phlebotomy ser-
vices are expected to resume

today as parts of the University
of Michigan Health System re-
open after a water line break
forced certain departments in
the Cancer Center to close on
Tuesday.
While cleanup and accommo-
dations were made to minimize
damage within 24 hours of the
leak; the cause of the flooding
has not been determined and
will not be for at least another
week, UMHS spokeswoman

Kara Gavin said.
"Everything is almost back
to normal," Gavin said. "Shar-
ing information and deciding
quickly what to do really helped
get this cleaned up and get
things up and running again."
Gavin said the University
Hospital is well prepared for
unforeseen circumstances that
require relocating patients,
and that decisions on further
displacements will be faculty-

based.
"The respiratory therapists'
area still needs some cleanup,
but that doesn't affect patients
or where they're located,"
Gavin said.
Level B2 of the University's
Comprehensive Cancer Center,
the clinics and infusion areas
are scheduled to open today.

Cafe Habana, which shares an

UMHS study says

Eighty percent
of pharmacies
nationwide report
scarcities
By MARY HANNAHAN
Daily Staff Reporter
to recent years, medical
patients have had a difficult
time securing prescription
drugs. Based on the results of
an October University study,
patients in the University
of Michigan Health System
haven't been spared from the
challenge of obtaining medi-
cation.
University researchers
quantified the personnel
resources needed to manage
drug shortages nationally and
defined the impact of drug
scarcities on health systems
across the country. After sur-
veying 353 pharmacy direc-
tors in hospitals across the
country, the study concluded
that the estimated labor costs
associated with managing
drug shortages is about $216
million nationally.

Burgunda Sweet, direc-
tor of drug information and
investigational drug ser-
vices at UMHS and one of
the authors of the study, said
there are additional labor
costs because clinicians have
to search for drugs that are
similar to medication that is
inaccessible to their patients.
While drug shortages have
been prevalent for the past
decade, Sweet said the prob-
lem has continued to worsen,
especially in the past two
years as the number of drugs
in short supply has continued
to grow.
"The numbers have gone
up considerably and the rate
of increase continues to be at
a pretty steep incline," Sweet
said.
The study found that 80
percent of health systems
nationwide reported a short-
age of three specific drugs
- dextrose syringes, epi-
nephrine injection and suc-
cinylcholine injections.
According to the Food and
Drug Administration web-
site, there were shortages
of 178 drugs in 2010, 132 of

Official: Florida terror
suspect met with radicals

25-year-old plotted
to attack night clubs,
sheriff's office
PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) -
The man accused by U.S. authori-
ties of plotting to bomb Florida
nightclubs and a sheriff's office
met with radical Islamists dur-
ing visits to his native Kosovo, a
senior official in the country said
yesterday.
International agencies had
alerted Kosovo authorities that
Sami Osmakac could be linked to
Islamist extremists, the official
told The Associated Press. He
said the 25-year-old, an ethnic
Albanian and naturalized U.S.
citizen, discussed "issues in sup-
port of radical elements" with the

individuals he met.
The official spoke on condi-
tion of anonymity because of the
issue's sensitivity. He declined to
disclose further details.
U.S. authorities say Osmakac
planned to use a car bomb and
other weapons in an Islamist-
inspired attack in the Tampa area
of Florida.
He was arrested Saturday
- the day officials said he was
planning his attack - after he
allegedly bought explosive devic-
es and firearms from an under-
cover agent. The items were
disabled prior to the sale.
Before his arrest, Osmakac
recorded an eight-minute video
explaining why he wanted to
bring terror to his "victims'
hearts," according to a federal
complaint. The complaint said

he asked the undercover agent to
videotape the explanation.
Online videos have also
emerged that show Osmakac rail-
ing against Christians, Jews and
Western living.
Osmakac lived with his par-
ents in a tan stucco home in Pinel-
las Park, Fla., a small city west of
Tampa. He worked occasionally
at the Balkan Food Store and Bak-
ery in St. Petersburg, a small store
owned by his parents.
He also occasionally visited his
Kosovo, where he still has rela-
tives.
Osmakac's aunt, Time Osman-
kaj, told the AP on Tuesday that
Sami Osmakac was last in Koso-
vo in October 2011, but that she
learned ofhisvisit from neighbors
and that he did not contact her or
other relatives. Kosovo authori-
ties also recorded earlier visits,
one of them in May 2011.
U.S. officials have used a dif-
ferent spelling for the suspect's
last name - Osmakac - than
the one his family uses here in
Kosovo.

of a young Peruvian woman he
met at a Lima casino who was
killed five years to the day after
the unsolved disappearance in
Aruba of an American teen in
which he remains the main sus-
pect.
"Yes, I want to plead guilty. I
wanted from the first moment
to confess sincerely," he told
the panel of three judges that
will decide his fate, hoping for
a reduced sentence. "I truly am
sorry for this act. I feel very
bad."
Prosecutors are asking for a
30-year prison sentence under
charges that carry a 15-year
minimum.
The 24-year-old Dutch citi-
zen did not show emotion during
his brief confession in fractured
Spanish and did not call on the
services of a Dutch translator
provided for the proceeding.
He bowed his head later when
his lawyer, Jose Jimenez, argued
that he killed Stephany Flores,
21, as a result of "extreme psy-
chological trauma" he suffered
from being "persecuted" over
the disappearance of Natalee
Holloway on the Caribbean
island of Aruba, "something he
says he never did and for which
no evidence at all exists."
He said judges, in sentencing,
should consider the "post-trau-

matic stress" his client suffered.
Conferring privately with
Jimenez before leaving the
courtroom, Van der Sloot briefly
smiled.
The judges have 48 hours to
render a sentence and the pre-
siding magistrate, Victoria Mon-
toya, said it would reconvene
Friday to do so.
Van der Sloot's trial opened
last week but was adjourned to
yesterday after he asked for more
time to decide how to plead. He
said then that he was inclined
to confess but did not accept the
aggravated murder charges the
prosecution sought.
Van der Sloot, who wore faded
jeans and an untucked light-blue
button-down shirt, had con-
fessed to the May 30, 2010, kill-
ing long ago.
He told police shortly after the
murder that he killed Flores in a
fit of rage after she discovered
his connection to the disappear-
ance of Holloway on his laptop
while they played poker online.
His lawyer argues it was man-
slaughter, for which the mini-
mum sentence is 5 years.
Police forensic experts disput-
ed that claim and the attorney for
the victim's family contends Van
der Sloot killed Flores, a business
student from a prominent family,
in order to rob her.

Senate Democrats
developing plan for
new college grants
Democrats in the Michigan
Senate said yeste they're develop-
ing a proposal that would allow
Michigan high school graduates
to get grants of up to roughly
$9,500 a year for attending col-
lege by ending some business tax
credits and other revenue chang-
es.
The grants could be used to pay
tuition or associated costs at pub-
lic universities and community
colleges in the state. The money
would be raised by closing what
Democrats call tax loopholes and
ending some business tax credits,
collecting sales tax from out-of-
state Internet retailers and saving
money on state contracts.

Almost.500,000
minivans, SUVs
recalled by Ford
Ford Motor Co. said yesterday
that it's recalling nearly half a mil-

of a pair of mechanical issues.
The Dearborn, Mich.-based
automaker is recalling 205,896
Freestar and Mercury Monterey
minivans made during the 2004
and 2005 model years, because
their torque converter output
shaft may fail. If that happens,
there could be a sudden loss of
power that could cause a crash,
Ford said.
Ford is also recalling 244,530
Escape SUVs made during the
2001 and 2002 model years,
because their brake master cylin-
der reservoir cap could leak brake
fluid. If the fluid leaks, it could
corrode electrical connectors in
the vehicle's breaking system and
lead to melting, smoke, or a fire,
Ford said.
Ford said that with both
recalls, it will inform the affected
owners, and dealers will replace
the parts for free.

Murder not a top

For the first time in 45 years,
homicide has fallen off the list of
the nation's top causes of death.
U.S. Health officials say the
murder rate fell enough in 2010
to drop it out of the top 15 causes.
Criminologists have not reached a

years.
Meanwhile, death rates have
been rising for diseases that kill
the elderly. Moving up to take to
homicide's place on the list was a

kills people 75 and older. The top
two causes of death are heart dis-

ease and cancer, which account

cameraman killed

A French cameraman was
killed yesterday in Syria during
a government-authorized trip to

Western journalist to be slain
since the country's uprising began
10 months ago, officials said.
' The killing of Gilles Jacquier,
43, who worked for France-2
Television, was likely to become
a rallying cry for both sides of
the conflict, as President Bashar

blame each other for arecent spate
of mysterious attacks.
According to a reporter who
was on the media trip, the group
was hit by several grenades. As

were killed, but the figure could

"France-2 Television has just

Crisis between
government,
military escalates
ISLAMABAD (AP) - Paki-
stan's prime minister fired the
defense secretary yesterday in a
dispute over a memo sent to Wash-
ington that has enraged the army,
escalating a crisis pitting the
civilian government against the
powerful military leadership.
The army warned darkly of
"grievous consequences" as a
result of the standoff, which is
hampering U.S. efforts to rebuild
shattered ties with the nuclear-
armed nation that are needed to
negotiate an end to the war in
neighboring Afghanistan. The
tensions have consumed the rul-
ing elite in a country that is
struggling to overcome economic
turmoil and a bloody al-Qaida
fueled insurgency.
The developments were a sign
of near-open conflict between
the army, which has often seized
power in the country's six-decade
history. Relations between Presi-
dent Asif Ali Zardari and the
generals have never been good,
but have soured dramatically in
recent months..
Instability has dogged the.
government since it took office
in 2008 after a 10-year army dic-
tatorship, and there have been
frequent, wrong predictions of
its demise. While unpopular, the
government has a solid majority in
parliament and it's unclearwheth-
er the army or the Supreme Court
have the stomach to unseat it.
The unsigned memo sent to
Washington asks for its help in
reining in the power of the mili-

tary in exchange for favorable
security policies. It was allegedly
masterminded by Pakistan' envoy
to Washington, who resigned in a
failed attemptto stem the fallout.
The affair has outraged the
army, which has portrayed it as
a treasonous threat to national
security.
Acting under army pressure,
the Supreme Court ordered a
probe to establish whether the
memo had been sanctioned by
Zardari, a prospect that could lead
to impeachment hearings. As part
of the investigation, army chief
Gen. Ashfaq Pervez Kayani and
the head of the main spy agency,
Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, said
in statements submitted to the
court that the memo was genuine
and part of a conspiracy against
the army.
Prime Minister Yousuf Reza
Gilani said in an interview to a
Chinese newspaper this week
that Kayani and Pasha had violat-
ed the constitution by submitting
the statements. The interview
was also published by Pakistan's
state-run news agency. The
army denied the men's actions
were illegal, and said in a state-
ment that Gilani's allegations
had "very serious ramifications
with potentially grievous conse-
quences for the country." It did
not elaborate.
Gilani's office later said that
Defense Secretary Naeem Khalid
Lodhi, a retired general and army
loyalist seen as a bridge between
the high-command and the civil-
ian government, was dismissed
for "gross misconduct and illegal
action." He was replaced with
Nargis Sethi, who is close to
Gilani, the statement said.

ident in the fall, Obama's visit
home was all about summoning
his backers' enthusiasm for the
fight ahead.
"If you're willing to work
even harder in this election than
you did in the last election, I
promise you, change will come,"
Obama said at the first of three
evening fundraisers, a large
event at the University of Illi-
nois at Chicago.
"You can't back down - not
now. We won't give up - not
now," Obama said. "We've got
to send a message we are going
to keep pushing and fighting for
the change that we believe in."
Obama used the trip to
restock his re-election finances
while making a surprise visit
to his campaign headquarters
for the first time. A few hun-
dred staffers listened as Obama

reminisced about the early days
of his Senate campaign and
thanked campaign aides for
their hard work. But publicly,
the president was beginning to
offer a contrast with Romney.
Obama's team has castigated
Romney at every turn as a politi-
cal opportunist willing to alter
his views - on abortion, the
environment and gay marriage
- to serve his political purpose.
Without naming Rom-
ney, Obama said he had led an
administration of principle that
has tried to invigorate the econ-
omy and kept its promises.
"I'm not a perfect man. I'm
not a perfect president, but I
promise you this - and I've kept
this promise - I will always tell
you what I believe and I will
always tell you where I stand."
"If you stick with me, we're
going to finish what we started
in 2008," Obama said.
Obama's campaign has
hauled in more than $150 mil-
lion through September, but
Democrats say they will need to
compete with Republican-lean-
ing outside groups that can raise
and spend unlimited amounts
of money to back specific candi-
dates.
Obama's event at the Univer-
sity of Illinois had ticket prices
starting at $44 per person and
he attended a pair of pricier fun-
draisers with tickets ranging
from $7,600 for one event and
$35,800 per couple for the other.
At the Lincoln Park home of
Fred Eychaner, a Chicago media
mogul, Obama joined with some
financial backers who had sup-
ported him since he served in

the Illinois state senate. The
president said he had stayed
true to the vision he had laid out
as a local candidate long ago and
his agenda as a presidential can-
didate four years ago.
"The reason I was successful
was not because I was a flaw-
less candidate or I ran a flawless
campaign but it was because
together we were able to give
voice to this shared vision of
what America should be. And
I want you to know that I have
kept faith with that vision all
these years," Obama said to a
dinner audience that included
former Senate colleagues Dick
Durbin of Illinois and Claire
McCaskill of Missouri and Illi-
nois Gov. Pat Quinn.
Obama arrived in Chicago
Wednesday on an unseasonably
warm early evening, and his
motorcade zipped along a bar-
ren Lakeshore Drive, cleared of
rush-hour traffic, to his down-
town campaign headquarters.
The White House said Obama
wanted to show his apprecia-
tion to his campaign staff with
the surprise visit - the presi-
dent's first to the headquarters
- but the White House kept the
moment private. Reporters trav-
eling with the president were not
allowed to witness the visit by
Obama, who has insisted he is
focused on governing, not cam-
paigning.
A White House statement said
Obama thanked his staffers for
their hard work and encouraged
them, saying that he hoped to
run "a campaign that embodies
the values we're fighting for."

Israeli leader hints at
involvement in attacks

Typically mum
military leaders
comment on Iran
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli
leaders typically greet word of vio-
lent setbacks to Iran's nuclear pro-
gram with a wall of silence. Now
a throwaway comment by Israel's
military chiefhas hinted of possible
Israeli involvement in attacks like
the explosion that killed an Iranian
nuclear scientistyesterday.
The car bombing in Teh-
ran was the latest in a string of
murky mishaps for Iran's nuclear
program caused by computer
worms, explosions and assassi-

nations of top experts. Israel,
which has identified a nuclear
Iran as an existential threat, is
widely suspected of involvement.
While officials never com-
ment on covert military activi-
ties, testimony by Lt. Gen. Benny
Gantz to a closed parliamentary
committee on Tuesday appeared
particularly prescient.
The Israeli military leader told
the Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee on Tuesday that
"2012 is expected to be a critical
year for Iran." He cited "the con-
fluence of efforts to advance the
nuclear program, internal lead-
ership changes, continued inter-
national pressure and things
that happen to it unnaturally."

Romney hopes to turn South
Carolina into rivals' last stand

#MICHLINKS

Jan. 21 primary
a crucial election
contest
COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -
Republican presidential hopeful
Mitt Romney braced for a bru-
tal 10-day onslaught in South
Carolina as he looks to turn the
first-in-the-South primary into
the last stand for his Republican
rivals.
Coming off twin victories in
Iowa and New Hampshire, the
former Massachusetts governor
was already trying Wednesday
to lower expectations that he'll
win in a state defined by notori-
ously nasty politics, conserva-
tive Christians and an active
tea party - elements his rivals
hope they can use to slow what's
beginning to look like a sprint to
the nomination.
"Clearly I face more of an
uphill battle in South Caro-
lina than I have here in New
Hampshire," Romney said as
he boarded his campaign plane
in Bedford, Mass., en route to
Columbia. He lost in South Caro-
lina in 2008.
"Last time I came in fourth,"
he said, "so, you know, our team
recognizes this is going to be a
challenge."
Among those challenges:
fighting against attacks on his
time at Bain Capital, keeping
his campaign on message after
verbal missteps about pink slips
and liking to fire people, and
staying vigilant for any whisper

campaign about his Mormon
religion.
Rivals Rick Perry, Newt Gin-
grich and Rick Santorum were
scramblingto break through and
become a viable conservative
alternative to Romney. The early
contests scrambled the field,
with Santorum nearly winning
in Iowa but falling back in New
Hampshire. Gingrich led polls
in December but faded in the
face of withering attacks from
Romney's allies on the airwaves
in Iowa.
"We have everybody now
gunning with full-time despera-
tion. For most all of them, there
is no life after South Carolina,"
said Warren Tompkins, Rom-
ney's strategist in the state.
"Desperate people do desperate
things."
Most important, Romney
aides say, is trying to ensure
no single conservative oppo-
nent emerges so he can move
into Florida from a position of
strength. Romney is the only
candidate with a full operation
there, with calls, mail and TV
ads - and his top advisers now
see it as the place where Romney
can prove he's the only candidate
able to go the distance.
Florida's sizable Hispanic
population means it's also an
opportunity for Romney to
look ahead to the general elec-
tion. He's now on the air with a
Spanish-language ad featuring
his son Craig, who speaks Span-
ish. And on the trail, Romney is
dropping hints that he'll focus

his general election efforts on
Latino voters.
, "I need to get 50.1 percent of
Americans behind me," Romney
said during a speech in Nashua,
N.H. If he can win over Latino
Americans, "I can do well pretty
broadly."
First, he'll have to face down
SouthCarolina -,nd the mil-
lions in super PAC advertising
that will be directed at him. Gin-
grich allies plan to spend mil-
lions on ads hitting Romney's
record at Bain.
Romney advisers say they'll
start to point out where profits
from venture capital firms often
go: charitable foundations, uni-
versity endowments and pension
and retirement funds.
More helpful may be a grow-
ing conservative backlash
against what many on the right
say is an anti-capitalist atti-
tude. South Carolina Sen. Jim
DeMint, who backed Romney
in 2008 but isn't endorsing any
candidate this time, defended
Romney's time at Bain during a
radio interview. Radio talk show
host Rush Limbaugh also stood
up for him.
Romney learned anew in
New Hampshire how his rivals
will use his own words against
him. His reference to worrying
about receiving a pink slip as a
freshly minted Harvard MBA
and his comments about liking
to fire people gave his opponents
an opening to claim he's out of
touch with ordinary Americans
and a cold-hearted businessman.

A fair shot
Campaign contributions shouldn't sway elections
Jt takes a lot to win a presidential election in the United States.
Candidates need a platform, supporters and a staff - but most
of all they need money. The 2010 Supreme Court ruling Citizens
United v. The Federal Election Commission removed any and all lim-
its on contributions from businesses to Political Action Committees.
These super PACs permit corporations to indirectly fund political
campaigns limitlessly, they threaten to drown out the voices of the
people and allow companies to manipulate politicians and influence
elections. The ruling hurts many of the quality candidates who don't
have enough cash to keep up with other candidates, and the citizens
of the U.S. deserve an election that isn't impacted by finances.

Presidential candidate, former Utah Gov.
Jon Huntsman's financial moderation may
be hurting him in the polls. Huntsman has
suffered several attacks from former Massa-
chusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the GOP front-
runner, and he finished a distant third in
the New Hampshire primary. Former House
Speaker Newt Gingrich's PAC, Winning Our
Future, just received $5 million to finance
negative advertising against Romney in
South Carolina. Huntsman isn't in the same
type of financial position to further his own
campaign.
The upcoming presidential election will
be the first impacted by the Citizens United
ruling, and its effects are already visible. It's
no coincidence that Romney was the biggest
spender. His Restore Our Future super PAC
spent more than $700,000 on attack ads. Rom-
ney's attacks on Gingrich, who finished fourth
in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire Pri-
mary, significantly affected the former front-
runner's campaign. Gingrich also spent more
than $700,000 less than Romney. It seems
that the winning candidate won't necessarily
have the most appeal or best ideas, but he will
have the largest bankroll. A significant portion
of these funds come from support of the gas,
tobacco and casino industries.
It's unfortunate that the Supreme Court has
allowed such pervasive corporate influence to
affect our political system. The court's deci-
sion was based on the theory of "corporate
personhood," which dictates that corporations

are individual entities deserving of representa-
tion. The Citizens United decision was made
to protect political speech, but it has effec-
tively diminished it. The electoral process has
become decentralized from theneeds of the
voter and is focused on corporate interest.
Corporate personhood drowns out the average
voter and amplifies the voice of a single organi-
zation, giving it the-powers that a single person
alone does not have.
The Citizens United decision changed the
culture of campaigning. Before 2010, a provi-
sion of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance
law prohibited private companies from spon-
soring advertisements advocating for a spe-
cific issue. However, the new Supreme Court
decision overturned this aspect of the Act. The
Democracy is Strengthened by Casting Light
on Spending in Elections Act, a 2010 effort
of the congressional Democrats that never
passed, would have created greater transpar-
ency in campaign funding and expenditures.
Such a measure would not fix the problem, but
would be a way to further provide Americans
with the information they need to make an
informed voting decision.
The responsible course of action is to repeal
corporate personhood and abolish super PACs.
Monetary gifts may translate to an unfair
advantage in the polls. Campaigns shouldn't be
bidding wars. Elections should reflect the dem-
ocratic ideals upon which the United States
was founded. The American public deserves an
election free from the bias of the pocketbook.

The Iowa caucuses serve
as an early glimpse of the
front-runners of the non-
incumbent presidential nomina-
tions. Theytell us
a lot about what's
on the minds
of Americans,
including young
voters. Like in
2008 when then-
senator Barack
Obama received SARAH
a whopping 66 ROHAN
percent of the
vote from people
ages 18-29, this
year the pivotal youth voters have a
strong preference - Rep. Ron Paul
(R-Texas). Receiving 48 percent of
the youth vote in Iowa, Paul beat
out overall victor Mitt Romney and
runner-up Rick Santorum by a mar-
gin of 35 percent and 25 percent,
respectively. In Tuesday night's New
Hampshire primary, Paul received
47 percent of the youth vote.
Paul's considerable margin of vic-
tory among the youth tells us more
about America's young voters than
simply their preference of nominee.
The results illustrate emerging atti-
tudes and trends in young voters.
As a libertarian, Paul' promotes
the idea of a limited government,
even more so than do his conserva-
tive opponents.
At the Conservative Political
Action Conference in 2010, Paul
stated that, "Personal liberty is the
purpose of government; to protect
liberty, not to run your personal
lives,not to runthe economy and not
to pretend that we can tell the world
how they ought to live." In congru-
ence with this statement, Paul advo-
cates reduced federal interference in
issues of civil liberties such as gay

marriage and drug use.
Young Americans tend to equate
the idea of diminished government
interference with increased inde-
pendence, making Paul an alluring
candidate. Paul's non-intervention-
ist foreign policy ideals also appeal
to voters raised in a culture of "do
what's best for you." In recent gener-
ations, enlightened self-interest has
come to replace communal respon-
sibility, and it's demonstrated by
the 48 percent of young voters who
chose Paul at the caucuses.
Unlike his counterparts, Paul
extends the idea of scaling back
government to the U.S. military,
where he wants to cut both size and
spending. Since the vietnam War
and onward, the military has been
a source of great concern to young
Americans as they come of age to be
citizens of service. And, as a costly
and controversial decade-long war
comes to a close, Americans are
even more inclined to advocate for a
smaller military role.
America's youth also greatly
admire Paul's willingness to halt
excessive spending. As the federal
debt stands at $15 trillion, younger
generations become increasingly
aware that they are the ones who.
will be responsible for stabilizing
America's spending and control-
ling the debt. One way of doing so,
according to Paul, is to cut spend-
ing on Medicare and Social Security
- two programs that do not benefit
American citizens until their later
years. "Stabilizing the budget
should be atop every candidate's
list," LSA freshman and first-time
voter Beatrice volkmar told me in an
interview. "Of the Republican nomi-
nees, Ron Paul is the most willing to
cut spending that America cannot
afford. His cuts might be extreme,

but so is the debt."
What makes Paul such a viable
candidate to young adults is that he
represents radical change. You don't
need to look further than Obama's
2008 campaign to understand that
as optimists, and perhaps even ide-
alists, the youth believe in the ben-
efits and possibility of change. While
more weathered voters view Paul's
These voters
believe in the
need for change.
positions as unrealistic, extreme and
risky, the young see them as quick
and effective fixes to festering prob-
lems.
Though endorsements by the
youth alone are unlikely to carry
Ron Paul all the way to GOP nomi-
nation, Obama serves as an example
of the impact young voters can have
on an election. In 2008 he received
66 percent of the youth vote. With-
out it, he could very well have lost
the race. Ron Paul - though accru-
ing a smaller percentage of young
votes - potentially stands in a simi-
lar position. If Americans can learn
anything from their youth in the last
election and so' far in the Republi-
can primaries, it's that the young
like radical change, even if it may be
unrealistic to achieve. Political risk
takers of today enjoy support from
the generations that do not yet have
much to lose.

It's been 5,908 days since I
have eaten a fruit or vegetable.
This isn't a joke. This talent may
not be super-
hero-worthy,
but that's likely
because the.
Justice League
clearly hasn't
gotten around
to my applica-
tion yet.
Mind you,
5,908 is a fairly YONAH
exact number. LIEBERMAN
The proof is in a
picture from my
third birthday party. It's pretty clas-
sic, as photos go - a child holding a
banana, mouth wide open, probably
smiling but possibly crying. The jury
is still out on that one.
Another awkward confession
- the majority of my life before 16
is extremely hazy. So what I know
about childhood, I've learned by
watching a few Gerber commer-
cials and Discovery Channel docu-
mentaries. I tend to think that kids
might not even like eating fruits or
vegetables.
Shocking, I know. For some reason
- on the eighth day - God created
phrases like "here comes the choo-
choo train" and "open up for the air-
plane." It's kind of interestingthat we
are supposed to open our mouths for
motorized vehicles. There must be
some sort of hidden meaning there.
As a history major, I'm inclined to
think this has something to do with
capitalism and the Industrial Revolu-
tion, but my friend studying psychol-
ogy swears that Freud would make
some sort of phallic analysis. I'll
spare you all the jokes. '
Apparently I came to some bril-
liant realization after my third
birthday party and joined my peers
by resisting the oppressive fruits

5,908 days
and vegetables. What separates me
from the pack - or the berry bunch,
if you will - is that I never caved to
the pressure.
To this day, when I see salad I
can feel my stomach shrink up like
a raisin in the sun. Luckily Langs-
ton Hughes isn't around; just a lot of
chopped vegetables next to an imag-
inary Pillsbury Doughboy, willing
me not to make his past nutritional
mistakes. I never listen. But I always
rub his belly.
These days I avoid fruits and
veggies at any cost. I've boiled my
diet down to five main food groups:
bagels, cheese, eggs, tortillas and
cheese, again. New federal guide-
lines may force an end to my streak
before it hits 6,000 due to my love
of pizza. However, 'I am confident
the rule was only changed because
someone in our big government was
jealous of Herman Cain's pizza-
infused smile.
This isn't information I readily
share, because when I tell people,
their quizzical reactions are .more
predictable than my Facebook news-
feed before a football game. They
always ask, "Why?"
. My first reaction is to shake them
and scream, "Just because!" I don't
do this, of course. The tipping point
was probably when my grandmother
took out a restraining order on me.
There mustbe some sort of double
standard at play. How come Gushers
and Fruit by the Foot don't count?
The word "fruit" is literally in the
title. Where is big government when
I actually need it?
In reality, the answer to the pre-
dictable question is actually quite
simple. Fruits and veggies freak me
out.Imagine if you picked the earwax
flavored jellybeans like Dumbledore
did or if a serial killer kidnapped you
and locked you in his basement (and
then gave you the jellybean).

In a world where most of my food
can be processed to taste better, how
can I enjoy anything natural? Fruits
are sticky, and vegetables are dirty.
Not my cup of tea. Butgive me a little
sour cream and a few cheese quesa-
dillas and I'm in heaven.
I love nature just as much as the
next person - probably even more.
I just don't want to eat it. I'd rather
enjoy it on a full stomach of Kraft
Macaroni & Cheese and a bag of
Doritos.
Don't hide from
the quirks that
define you.
Seventeen years without fruits or
vegetables hasn't been so bad, I've
learned a lot about myself and about
the world. For example, I've deduced
that either scurvy does not exist or
that I would have made a damn good
pirate back in the day.
I realize that this entire column
has been hard to swallow. For many
of you, fruits and veggies are simply
parts of your day. For me, though, it's
a struggle to even write about them.
But in the end, this is me. Each of
us has these strange things we seek
to hide from the rest of the world. I
encourage you all to not hide from
the weird quirks that make you who
you are.
Tomorrow will be my 5,909th day
without eating any fruits or vegeta-
bles, but hey, who's counting?

CAMPAIGN
From Page 1A
the campaign will start, May
said in an interview with the
Daily last fall that the campaign
will launch sometime "during
this decade."
May said the University has
embarked upon a' major fund-
raising drive every decade since
the 1940s, except the 1970s. With
the University's 2017 bicenten-
nial approaching, May said it's
likely that the campaign will
overlap with the celebrations on
campus.
"One of our greatest distinc-
tions in this new campaign is
that we're going to start the
third century," May said. "That's
a pretty good thing. One of the
things about campaigns is that
you want to appeal to tradition."
Though the campaign's official
launch maybe years inthe future,
University's deans have held dis-
cussions regarding specific goals
and have also met with Coleman,
Hanlon, the University's Board of
Regents and other officials over
the past year, May said.
Coleman said a new cancer
center at the University Hos-
pital and further collaboration
between the Ross School of Busi-
ness and the College of Engi-
neering have been discussed, but
noted these are just preliminary
ideas.
"There are all sorts of ideas
bubbling up right now, and
that's what's so exciting about
planning the campaign. We're
not there yet, but I'm just hear-
ing all these great ideas," Cole-
man said..
As goals for the campaign are
being established, the Univer-
sity's Office of Development is
laying the groundwork for the
campaign's fundraising infra-
structure. May, Baird and the
rest of the fundraising team have
begun to train the deans and
development staff in preparation
for the campaign.
Several new deans - includ-
ing Alison Davis-Blake, dean
of the Business School, and
Marie Lynn Miranda, dean of
the School of Natural Resources
and Environment - that have
joined the University since the
last campaign ended, will need
to start developing relationships
with donors, May said.
"When (deans) come in, they
need to be trained in the Michi-
gan culture," May said. "Some
need to be shored up in fund-
raising, others need to come in
and understand how Michigan

want," Shore said. "But we want
to make sure that we're not put-
ting something in there that
somebody might not really use."
At the session held at Blake
Transit Center on Fourth Ave-
nue - Ann Arbor's main hub for
AATA buses - bus riders were
surveyed about what features
they would like in a newly built
transit center.
The surveys included dis-

cussion on improved technol-
ogy - such as a touch-screen
trip planning service with func-
tionality similar to Google Maps
and real-time arrival and depar-
ture signs. Other topics included
customer amenities like vending
machines, a USB charging station
and a food and beverage cart.
Another survey asked for rid-
ers' thoughts on a proposed floor
plan for the center. Riders who
aren't available to attend either
session may complete an online
survey to give their feedback.
Terry Black, project manager
for the construction of the new
Blake Transit Center, said the
replacement of the center is long
past due. He said the sessions will
help builders fine-tune their cur-
rent designs to meet the needs of
Ann Arbor residents.
"I think we're close to where

works."
Baird said he's the "details
guy" in terms of fundraising
training and preliminary plan-
ning for the upcoming capital
campaign. He formerly served as
a vice chancellor at the Univer-
sity's Dearborn campus and was
hired in September to lead the
campaign.
"It's really a lot about process
and strategic planning," Baird
said. "On any given day, I could
be consulting on an issue with
units to bolster their fundraising.
teams. It's very much an internal
planning and strategic planning
process and role."
May and Baird agreed that
there were areas that the Uni-
versity could improve on from
the previous campaign - most
notably in donor stewardship.
According to Baird, in order for
donors to feel like they're actual-
ly making a difference with their
contributions, it's critical for the
University to ensure that they're
involved with finding a perfect
cause to donate to the University.
"They want to provide help
and support," Baird said. "That's
another thing that campaigns do
- they help organize and galva-
nize the volunteers because they
have this sense of urgency."*
More than 365,000 donors
contributed to the last campaign,
but May said the University will
need to identify individuals who
have not previously donated to
the University. He added that the
University will continue to seek
pledges from international and
non-alumni donors.
Though the economic outlook
of the country is uncertain, May
said economic conditions aren't
his top concern when deciding
when to launch the effort.
"Truthfully, some of the
richest people who went to the
University of Michigan are not
hurting, and those are the people
we'll ask for (contributions),"
May said.
Coleman said the University
is constantly in need of donors
and is always looking to improve
itself, regardless of the state of
the economy.
"The two most important
contributions made to this Uni-
versity were made during the
depth of the Depression - the
Law Quadrangle and the Rack-
ham Graduate School," Cole-
man said. "Those gifts - and
they were huge gifts at the time
- were made at a time when
the prospects of this nation
looked horrible at the time. You
can't stop. You can't predict the
future."
we need to be with the design
of (the center), but we're look-
ing to get some input on minor
tweaks we could make," Black
said. "We've had a high level of
(input) ... we've had it internally
and we've done a customer sur-
vey before, but we want the rid-
ers' input as well."
Ann Arbor resident Jamie Lee,
a regular bus rider who often
uses the Blake Transit Center,
said she thinks an upgraded cen-
ter was definitely needed.
"It could be more accommo-
dating," Lee said. "I think that

there's a lot of things that are
missing."
Lee said the current center
isn't sufficient for a city like Ann
Arbor.
"I feel like it doesn't neces-
sarily meet up with Ann Arbor's
expectations of what a bus cen-
ter should be like, especially
since it's such a moving city," Lee
added.
At yesterday's session, Lee
offered several ideas for the new
center.
"I would definitely recom-
mend it having more room for
people - it's really cramped
and crowded in here," Lee said.
"There should be more accessi-
bility because there are disabled
people that take the bus and the
one door on the far side of the
building isn't enough. It should
also have extended hours, with a
safer place for people to sit."

Haiti still struggling *
following earthquake

Officials say ailing
country is misusing
funds
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)
- The billions of dollars in aid that
flowed into Haiti after its shat-
tering earthquake were meant to
build a new nation with thriving
farms, apparel factories, modern
hospitals and paved roads in the
countryside.
Ambitious plans call for $500
million to build 50 new grade
schools, $200 million to give Port-
au-Prince its first wastewater
treatment plant, and $224 million
to create an industrial park for
65,000 garment industry workers
- all aimed at laying the ground-
work for a new Haiti.
But as the hemisphere's poorest
country marks the second anniver-
sary of the earthquake that killed
some 300,000 people, only about
half of the $4.6 billion in promised
aid has been spent. Half a million

people are still living in crowded
camps. And only four ofthe 10larg-
est projects funded by internation-
al donors have broken ground.
The optimistic rallying cry
promoted shortly after the earth-.
quake, to "build back better," has
turned out to be much harder to
achieve than anyone imagined.
Reconstruction efforts have been
stymied by the same problems
that impoverished Haiti in the
first place: chronic political insta-
bility, a lack of a robust central
government, and a tattered infra-
structure in a nation where, even
before the earthquake, half the
children did not attend school and
more than half the population was
unemployed.
Former U.S. President Bill
Clinton, the U. N. Special Envoy
to Haiti, said in an interview
Wednesday that the reality of
Haiti and its complicated history
made the hoped-for reconstruc-
tion difficult.
"We had massive, massive
problems in Haiti before the

earthquake," Clinton told The
Associated Press. "A lot of this
stuff we're not trying to rebuild -
we're actually trying to do it right
for the first time."
Haitian President Michel Mar-
telly also acknowledged that
achievements have fallen far
short of expectations, describing *
progress so far as "definitely, not
enough," in an interview with the
BBC.
"But lately, since I have been
in power, I will say that we have
shown strong signals that things
are changing and movingin Haiti,"
said the president, who took office
in May and whose squabbles with
parliament have contributed to the
delays.
The previous administration
of Presiden t Rene Preval was
crippled by the collapse of govern-
ment buildings and showed little
leadership in the aftermath. The
election that brought Martelly to
power was marred with irregu-
larities and riots that paralyzed
the capital.

OGDEN, Utah (AP) - A Utah
police officer killed in a gunbat-
tle last week with a suspected
pot grower was buried in a tear-
ful ceremony Wednesday that
itcluded a 21-gun salute, the
release of about a dozen white
doves and a statewide broadcast

callout.

patcher called three times, the
radio cracking. "Whiskey 12,
Agent Jared Francom may no
longer be with us, but he will not
be forgotten."
Thebroadcastwas heard atthe
Ogden City Cemetery, where it
drew tears and audible sobs from
family, friends and as many as
1,000 police officers. Afterward,

uniformed .officers streamed
pasted Frankom's casket, some
leavingbehind their white gloves
and patches from their respec-
tive agencies.
A seven-year veteran of the
Ogden police force, Francom was
killed as he and about a dozen fel-
low members of the Weber-Mor-
gan Narcotics Task Force tried to
serve a search warrant on Jan. 4.
The graveside services fol-
lowed an emotional public
memorial attended by more
than 4,000 at Weber State Uni-
versity's arena. The vast major-
ity of mourners were uniformed
officers, who stood and silently
saluted as the flag-draped casket
was wheeled in by members of
Francom's unit.
"What a sight to see," Tra-
vis Francom told mourners
while looking around the arena.
"I know my brother would be
proud, because we all are his
family."

Jared Francom, 30, loved his
job so much that he found it hard
to take a night off, said Shane
Keyes, a strike force colleague.
When he did, he checked in with
team members by phone and
text to see if they were safe and
if he was missing a big or excit-
ing case.
"That saying - 'a cop's cop'
- that was made for a guy like
Jared," Keyes said.
Another brother, Ben Fran-
com, said Jared was an "adrena-
line junkie" who loved skydiving
and had a "go big or go home
attitude." But he was also a light-
hearted person.
"He loved to crack jokes or to
smile, just to keep the mood light
and keep everyone around him
less stressed," he said.
Francom was also remem-
bered for his passion for the Dal-
las Cowboys, and for the wife and
two young daughters he called
each night he was on duty.

Death count totals 47,000

Two bodies found
decapitated outside
shopping mall
MEXICO CITY (AP) - Two
decapitated bodies were found at
the entrance to one of Mexico's
most luxurious shopping malls
on Wednesday and prosecu-
tors announced that more than
47,000 people have been killed
in drug violence in the five years

since President Felipe Calderon
launched a military crackdown
against drug cartels.
The bodies were found before
dawn inside a burning SUV just
off a toll highway at the entrance
to the shopping mall in the heart
of the Santa Fe district that is a
haven for international corpora-
tions, diplomats and the wealthy.
The heads and a threatening
message were dumped nearby,
Mexico City prosecutors said in
a statement.

Local media published images
of the charred car and reported
the note written on hot pink
paper was signed by the drug
gang "Mano con Ojos," or "Hand
with Eyes." The gang was once
part of the Beltran Leyva drug
cartel.
The victims, a man and a
woman in their 30s, have not
been identified, prosecutors said..
They said the SUV with license
plates from the neighboringState
of Mexico had been stolen.
Mexico's sprawling capi-
tal had been something of an
haven from the brutal car-
tel violence along the border
and in outlying states. But
gangs have been fighting for
an increasingly lucrative local
drug market for more than a
year, mainly on capital's work-
ing class outer neighborhoods
and suburbs.
The Santa Fe district, built
atop a former landfill on the
western edge of Mexico City,
houses the Mexican headquar-
ters of major corporations and
the Iberoamerican University,
one of Mexico's top private
schools, as well as modernis-
tic, heavily guarded high-rises
where wealthy Mexicans and
foreigners live.
Most of the violence had
escaped Santa Fe, which had
been seen as a sterile oasis dis-
connected from the hubbub of
most of the capital.
But as the fight among splin-
tering drug cartels intensi-
fies, the brazen attackers have
reached even into the country's
most guarded districts.
In October, the same Manos
con Ojos gang claimed respon-
sability for leavingtwo severed
heads on a street across from
the nation's top military base
in Mexico City.

Did Robinson learn anyhin at all

Michigan's season ended
with the sight of
Denard Robinson rac-
ing across the field, mouth com-
pletely agape, screaming at the top
of his lungs.
At that point - even having
led his team to a 11-2 season and
Sugar Bowl win - Michigan fans
may have
wanted to yell
at Robinson
as much as
they wanted to
scream with
him. Though
his two touch-
down tosses
to Junior TIM
Hemingway ROHAN
were crucial,
his few mis-
takes were costly. Had Virginia
Tech not struggled itself, Robin-
son could've been the scapegoat.
What other player could evoke
such dichotic confusion?
Two reasonable people could
have a conversation about Robin-
son's Sugar Bowl performance -
one could argue Michigan won the
game because of him, the other
that Michigan won despite him -
and neither would be wrong.
The same conversation could've
been had after a miracle comeback
win over Notre Dame in Septem-
ber, or after a close - but not so
close - road win at Northwestern
in October, or after November
games against mediocre Big Ten
teams: a nail-biting loss at Iowa
and a sluggish win at Illinois.
After each game, the Michigan
brass pounded the table in defense
of Robinson. He was improving,
they said. Yet after Robinson ran
across the field at the Superdome,
once what happened had been
digested, one couldn't help but

wonder if he had learned anything
at all.
Every Tuesday duringthe
season, offensive coordinator Al
Borges met with the media. And
every Tuesday, he defended Rob-
inson, offering assurances that
there was growth.
First, Robinson dragged Michi-
gan down against Notre Dame,
throwingthree interceptions.
Then, he willed 28 fourth-quarter
points - his receivers simply
started catching the risky jump
halls he kept launching- and,
ultimately, a win. That Tuesday,
Borges diagnosed a problem that
would become reoccurring.
"Generally, when he throws the
ball bad, it is because of his foot-
work or rushing throws," Borges
said. "When he got his feet set, he
made some really good throws. He
threw just a gorgeous corner route
to Kelvin Grady - right on time,
perfect trajectory.
"He's very capable, but he's still
learning all the nuances of the
offense, and in a pressure-packed
game like that, there's a lot of stuff
going on. It's easyto forget about
some little things."
A month later, Robinson threw
three more interceptions against
Northwestern's 71st-ranked pass
defense, and Michigan fell into a
huge first-half hole. Again, Robin-
son jump-balled his way out.
Robinson said he got too
excited early on. That Tuesday,
Borges said his accuracy was
off because he wasn't following
through with his hips. Still, the
identified problems persisted:
inaccuracy, hurried throws, poor
decision making. Robinson's mad-
ness boiled over at Iowa, where
he marched Michigan to Iowa's
three-yard line late in the game -
all the Wolverines needed was a

Junior quarterback Denard Robinson must improve in Borges' second year.

touchdown to tie. In theory, he did
his job. But he went 4-for-13 on the
final drive. This time, he couldn't
convert, and he wasn't the hero.
The next week, Borges refused
to throw into the wind at Illinois.
Robinson ran for two scores,
threw a pick and left the game
with an injury, all while playing
second fiddle to an emergent Fitz
Toussaint.
That Tuesday, Borges defied
the statistics and nearly every
outsider's opinion, declaring:
"Denard's growing in our offense.
Nobody wants to hear that."
Borges' vague claims that Rob-
inson was gaining a better overall
feel for the offense were justi-
fied in season-saving wins over
Nebraska and Ohio State. Robin-
son finally looked comfortable,
finding a balance between run-
ning and passing, and his precise
passingscreamed improvement.
Without linebackers breath-

ing down his neck, it was easy to
stand at a podium and say he was
improving. He said he knew when
to run, when to throw, and who to
throw to. The other side of a tran-
sition year seemed in sight.
But that would've been too neat
an ending for the kind of year Rob-
inson had.
Instead, he regressed to mid-
season form in the Sugar Bowl
- not quite as bad as his worst
(Michigan State) but nowhere
near his best. He reopened the
conversation: is Michigan's suc-
cess because of him, or despite
him? The Hokies' athletic defense
and early lead neutralized Robin-
son's legs, so the game rode on his
arm. When Virginia Tech blitzed
and Robinson felt pressure, which
was often, his progress was most
.questionable.
Flushed out of the pocket,
where it seems lie forgets his
throwing mechanics, Robinson

lofted a jump ball - off his back
foot - towards Hemingway. The
ball should've been intercepted.
Instead it was a 45-yard touch-
down. Earlier, as an unblocked
blitzer approached, he lofted aball
towards a well-covered Heming-
way (while Roy Roundtree had
a step on his man further down-
field) which resulted in an inter-
ception. It reassured logic - not
every miracle jumpball would
go his way. Later, staying true to
the madness, Robinson - with a
clean pocket and time to survey
the field - dialed up a perfect
pass to Hemingway in the back
of the endzone, where only he
could grab it. Michigan took a 17-6
lead, but it could've been more.
On back-to-back plays early in the
game, Robinson missed adding
another touchdown. The first was
a pass - intended for a wide-open
Hemingway - batted at the line of
scrimmage, and the next was an
off-balanced, underthrown screen
pass to Vincent Smith, who had
a host of blockers set up and no
tacklers in sight.
Borges often referred to Rob-
inson as a 3-point shooter, who
needed to make a few shotsbefore
he caught fire. Then, Borges said,
the basket would look like a hula-
hoop, and Robinson could keep
firing. Rarely this season did Rob-
inson string together.consecutive
drives fueled by his passing.
For that, and the up-and-down
Sugar Bowl, Borges is as much
to blame as Robinson. The play
calling didn't give Robinson easy
warm-up passes, and Robinson
didn't get hotter as the game went
on - "luckier" may have applied;
though. Robinson's mechanics
proved as reliable as his passing
statistics: a mixed bag.
To quell the criticism at his

Tuesday press conferences, Borg-
es pointed to how quarterbacks
typically performed better in their
second season in his system. His
famous example is UCLA's Cade
McNown, who he said rose from
last in passer efficiency in the con-
ference in year one, to first in the
country in year two. Borges hopes
to see the same jump in Robinson.
Considering thatbowl games
are viewed as starting points for
next year's team, and how Rob-
inson played Jan. 3, that maybe a
stretch. What Robinson did after
four weeks of preparation - 9-of-
21 passing for 117 yards - is alarm-
ing, and should open some eyes, no
matter how respected the Hokies
defense is.
What's scarier is that Robinson
opens his second season under
Borges versus defending national
champion Alabama. Albeit, their
defense will be without Courtney
Upshaw, the championship game's
defensive MVP, and likely without
future pros Dont'a Hightower and
Dre Kirkpatrick, among others.
Though if Robinson doesn't find
a consistentbalance and comfort
inside and out of the pocket, and
in Borges' playbook, it wouldn't
matter if the season opener was
Alabama or Northwestern.
Soon after Robinson's yell,
Borges was asked what went
through his head as Robinson con-
tinued to blindly throw up jump
balls to Hemingway. The man
who had coached Robinson for
the past year, who taught him the
intricacies of the offense and built
a toolbox of mechanics, let his
guard down: "Probably prayers,"
he admitted. After 13 games, even
he didn't know what to expect.

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Junior forward Chris Brown missed his shootout attempt against Lake Superior State on Saturday. He admitted that he didn't have his approach planned out.
'M'over-thinking shootout approach

By ZACH HELFAND
DailySportsEditor
After some thinking, junior
forward Chris Brown declared
that over-thinking has plagued
the Michigan hockey team dur-
ing shootouts this year.
The Wolverines' ineffective-
ness in that category has hurt
them in the standings this year
especially, but it's a decade-old
struggle.
"It's not like it's a lack of tal-
ent," Brown said. "I think we're
just screwing ourselves over in
our heads."
Shootouts, or, penalty shots in
general, have a habit of making
players over-think.
Forty-one years add 17 days
ago, the St. Louis Blues found
themselves in a battle against
the Minnesota North Stars in
an important game. The contest
came down to a late-game pen-
alty shot.
The shooter: a St. Louis for-
ward named Red Berenson. The
goalie: Cesare Maniago, Beren-
son's former teammate with the
New York Rangers.
"(Maniago) knew that I liked
to come in and fake the shot and
go to my backhand and roof it,"
Berenson said. "And of course, I
knew that he knew that, so I'm
thinking about this when I got
the penalty shot.

"So I'm thinking, 'Well, Cesare
knows that I'm gonna do that,
so he knows I won't do it. So
if he knows I won't do it, then
I'm gonna do it.' And so I went
through this whole thing in my
mind, so when I did it, I beat him.
He guessed that I wouldn't do it.
He was on the other side of the
net, it was an easy goal."
Got all that?
Berenson knows he took at
least one penalty shot in a 17-year
NHL career, plus three years
playing for Michigan. He thinks
he took a second one at some
point. When he played, there
were no shootouts.
Still, the level of detail he pro-
vides about a brief moment that
happened over four decades ago
shows he has a strong apprecia-
tion for what ashootout requires.
Not that that makes any differ-
ence.
"You can't coach it," Berenson
said.
The Wolverines simulate a
shootout in practice every week,
yet they dropped to 1-3 in shoot-
outs on Saturday after regulation
and an overtime period couldn't
decide a game against Lake Supe-
rior State. Sophomore forward
Luke Moffatt scored on Michi-
gan's first attempt, but the next
five skaters didn't even put the
puck on cage.
Berenson explained that the

goaltender holds a clear advan-
tage in shootouts.
"In a normal game, the average
goalie has a save percentage of 90
percent on his shots," Berenson
said. "Now he's not going to have
that same save percentage on
breakaways, but it's not going to
be under 50 (percent)."
Michigan is 2-for-15 on shoot-
out attempts. Do the math: that's
an 87-percent save percentage.
On average, the Wolverines
score 11 goals per 100 attempts in
game situations. They're on pace
for just two more goals per 100
attempts in shootout situations
than they score skating five-on-
five.
You don't need to know any-
thing about hockey to know that
that's not good.
A player can approach a penal-
ty shot from any number of mind-
sets, and each player has his own
personal style and preference.
Some players prefer to shoot
from the slot. Those with better
hands may prefer to deke. There
are skaters who come in fast.
Some try to lull the goalie to sleep
by advancing very slowly. Nei-
ther move is any more effective
than the other. The key, Brown
said, is to keep the goalie moving
and to make him uncomfortable.
And what happens when he
gets uncomfortable? Many, like
Brown, simply react to what the

goalie gives him.
"Hopefully, by the top of the
circle, you know what you're
going to do," Brown said. "If you
don't, you're kind of just throw-
ing it at the net and praying it
goes in."
Moffatt takes a different
approach. He scored in his first-
career shootout attempt on Sat-
urday, and he said he knew all
along that he would deke twice
and finish with his backhand.
"I have a few moves that I'm
very confident in," Moffatt said.
"I picked one beforehand, and
that's what I was doing the whole
time, and I stuck with it, and it
worked out."
Eventually, all of the planning
and styles, all of the machina-
tions and mental poker, can just
devolve into absurdity.
Brown said the team is simply
thinking too much - in shoot-
outs most notably, but also just in
general.
Berenson recalled someone
who once asked him why he
made the move on Maniago.
"They said, 'Well, why did you
make that move?'" Berenson said.
"And I said, 'Because he knew
that I would do it, but he knew
that I was smarter than that, so
he guessed that I wouldn't do it.'
"So there's a little bit of think-
ing in that one. Yeah."
I think so.

when Luka Mirkovic, the starting
center for the Wildcats, was kept
on the bench at the beginning of
the game - Northwestern coach
Bill Carmody had decided to go
with a smaller lineup. Beilein
also pointed to senior guard Zack
Novak's extended absence - he
picked up two early fouls - as
a factor in his team's first-half
defensive struggles.
"We didn't have a plan for

"He's got incredible numbers,
one of the best in the country.
When that came at us, they got
out to an early start on us, and
then Zack goes down. I was really
proud of the way we foughtback."
A 10-0 Wolverine run with
13:38 left in the second half -
punctuated by a fast-break, two-
handed dunk by Novak - gave
Michigan its first lead, 46-44,
since early in the first frame.
But the Wildcats didn't go
away, quickly regaining their
composure and retaking the
lead. From there, it was a defen-
sive battle, as neither team could
manage to get many open looks
nor hit the ones they did get.

Hardaway Jr. was the only one
keeping Michigan in it as North-
western threatened to break
away in the first frame, making
four of his five 3-point attempts
and finishing the half with 14
points. He saved his biggest
3-pointer for late in the game.
Hardaway Jr. hit the shot with
a hand in his face with just over
two and a half minutes remain-
ing, tying the game at 54-54 and
setting up the frenetic finish.
While the Wildcats got open
looks in the paint with ease in the
first frame, the Wolverines got
nothing out of their frontcourt.
When redshirt sophomore for-
ward Jordan Morgan wasn't los-
ing his man on cuts on defense, he
was getting swarmed in the paint
and failing to put the ball in the
basket on offense. And sophomore
forward Evan Smotrycz struggled
even more - Beilein was forced to
sit him at the 11-minute mark of
the firsthalfafterSmotrycz picked
up his second foul.
Morgan nearly crippled Mich-
igan in overtime when he picked
up a technical foul with just over
two minutes left for throwing an
elbow after a Wolverine basket.
But Michigan recovered and did
just enough to hold on to win.

If the rebounding effort of
the Michigan men's basketball
team on Wednesday night could
be described in one word, it'd be
offensive. But in
a good way. NOTEBOOK
The Wolver-
ines pounded the offensive glass
throughout the second half and
overtime, which helped them to
13 second-chance points in their
66-64 victory over Northwestern.
In fact, Michigan had just two
fewer offensive rebounds than
defensive rebounds on the game.
Twelve second-half offensive
rebounds and four more in over-
time were instrumental in keeping
Michigan's possessions alive and
overcoming an eight-point deficit.
"It helped give us extra pos-
sessions out there on the court,
and we really needed those
because we really weren't crash-
ing the offensive glass in the first
half," said sophomore forward
Tim Hardaway Jr. "So just get-
ting those extra opportunities
on offense and getting key plays
down the stretch really helped us
with the victory."
Michigan's 10-0 second-half
run, which erased the deficit and
gave Michigan a brief lead, was
sparked by an offensive rebound.
Senior guard Zack Novak followed
his miss on a 3-pointer, which gave
the Wolverines' possession new
life and culminated in an easy
layup from Hardaway Jr.
And with the Wildcats clinging
to a four-point lead with less than
five minutes remaining, Michi-
gan scrapped for three offensive
rebounds on the same possession.
Eventually, sophomore forward
Evan Smotrycz buried a jumper
to end a stretch of eight-straight
Wolverine misses.
In overtime, with the game
tied at 58, freshman point guard
Trey Burke rebounded his own

miss, then rebounded senior
guard Stu Douglass's miss and
buried a leaner to give Michigan a
lead it would not relinquish.
"Trey Burke," said Michi-
gan coach John Beilein. "I don't
want him ever getting offensive
rebounds because I always want
him rotating back. I'm glad he got
that one. Because that was a big
point in the game."
In the final minute of the game
with Michigan up a point, Hard-
away Jr. missed a 3-pointer, but
the Wolverines recovered it and
Burke knocked down two free
throws to give Michigan its final
margin of victory.
BURKE WORKS OVERTIME: It
was a tale of two halves for Burke.
But both halves were disappoint-
ing, so he used overtime to get the
happy ending.
The Columbus native went
4-for-15 in regulation and con-
tributed to the Wolverines' dis-
mal first half.
But in overtime, Burke put the
last 40 minutes behind him and
carried Michigan to its fourth Big
Ten victory. He scored eight of
the Wolverines' 12 points in the
extra frame and was unfazed at
the line, knocking down all six of
his free-throw attempts.
In the final minute, Northwest-
ern sent Burke to the line twice.
Both times, the Wolverines were
up by a point and needed two
makes to ensure thatthe Wildcats
could do no better than tie.
With the crowd of 12,605 qui-
eting to a hush on each attempt,
Burke stayed cool and found
nylon each time.
"Thank God we have him,"
Hardaway Jr. said. "That's what
I'm saying. Trey Burke is just
growing as the season goes on,
blossominginto agreatplayer and
a nationally ranked player. Him
knocking down these big free
throws just gives him more con-
fidence going down the stretch of
the season."

Michigan has held the bulk of

-RYBODY D ANCE N
'U' student groups keep diversity in motion
- Proma Khosla, Daily Arts Writer -

Diversity It's one of the most recurring
words in the University's literature. It's
a word thrown around in promotional
pamphlets or for applicants to define in
their admissions essays. The 'U' is home
to students from all walks of life, but be-
yond basic demographics, where is this
represented? On campus, as in the world
at large, one of the most prominent mani-
festations of cultural diversity is in the
arts - in this case, dance.
"People who are from all over can enjoy this one type of ac-
tivity," said LSA junior Jackie Davis, of the Arabian Dance En-
semble. "It's not limited to a certain type of people ... and we get
to show off that kind of dance that people aren't usually exposed
to and we can show them how cool it is.n
While history books and classes can educate people about
culture, dance is a firsthand way of immersing oneself in those
worlds. Dozens of teams at the 'U' perform and compete, each
as distinct and varied as steps in a dance.
SHUFFLE, BALL CHANGE
As of 2000, RhythM Tap Ensemble has been the foremost
tap dance group on campus. It's one of the core groups for
Dance Mix, an event that showcases different teams' dancing
near the end of each winter term.

"I think Dance Mix is probably the best show on campus for
dance because we try to ... include a lot of variety and diversity
in the show in terms of different dance styles," LSA senior and
RhythM president Chelsea Kimball said. "I think that we try to
show the audience something new every year."
Since tap requires precision with complex footwork, most
RhythM members have prior tap experience.
"There are people who have tapped every day since they
were three and there are some people, like me, who stopped
tapping once they were in high school and picked it back up in
college," Kimball said. "So most people have had tap experience
but everyone has their different levels of experience.'
Though tap is a commonly known style of dance, RhythM
dancers keep it fresh for audiences, introducing new genera-
tions to the world of tap dance. This includes guest perfor-
mances with groups like Impact, which fuses popular American
dance styles, and the lyrical ballet group, Salto.
RhythM also performs full-fledged collaborative pieceswith
fusion group PURE Dance Xtreme in the annual PureRhythM
show. RhythM performs with other groups in the show, while
PURE simultaneously performs in a more noticeably lyrical
style.
RhythM also collaborated with musical group Groove last
semester.
"That was also really cool because tap dance fits pretty well
with percussion," Kimball said.
The collaborations are among Kimball's favorite things
about RhythM, and in her opinion, the main thing that sets it
apart from other groups.
"Our numbers with PURE are ... something that we try to
always keep in the show," she said. "I think it's important and
I think the audience enjoys it too because it's something differ-
ent. It's not the same type of number (that people)see from both
of us individually."

"You have to make some compromises to incorporate both
styles," Kimball added. "There are some things that you can't do
in tap shoes and some things that the PURE dancers can't do.
It's kind of a blend."
Dance represents a constant to many students involved in
campus dance organizations. According to Kimball, it remains a
priority to RhythM members as they choreograph and contrib-
ute song ideas together.
"I think dance took up most of the girls on our team's lives
before coming to college, but I think it's still a huge part of ev-
"People who are from
all over can enjoy this
one type of activity.
It's not limited to a
certain type of people."
Jackie Davis, LSA junior
eryone's life," Kimball explained. "There are a couple girls on
the team who still teach regularly at their dance studios that
they used to go to. For others of us, we only do the RhythM
practices and performances, but it's still a big part of our college
experience as well!'

or "World on a Wire." Influenced by Kubrick, Vonnegut
and Phillip K. Dick, this three-and-a-half-hour sci-fi epic
has only recently been made publicly available. For a
night of supercomputers, simulations and cybernetic
conspiracies, swing by at 10 p.m. Tickets are $10.

MUSIC
Vusi Mahlasela, aka "The Voice," hails from South
Africa and will grace UMMA tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. He
performed at Nelson Mandela's 1994 inauguration and
now he's here in Ann Arbor. With music that addresses
social issues like apartheid, audiences will be reminded
of the importance of the arts in the struggle for human
right . Admission is free.

"Twelfth Night"
William Shakespeare
Jan. 5marked the official feast of Twelfth Night
- so why not read the Shakespeare masterpiece it
inspired? True love, intrigue and cross-dressing
make for a delightful storytelling combination.
Too busy to read it? See the 1996 film adaptation.
A young Helena Bonham Carter and Ben Kingsley
make it totally worth it.
"Wag the Dog"
It's election year and headlines are filled with
news of who the Republicans will put up against
Barack Obama come fall. In theaters, too, politics
pervade. 2011 gave us "The Ides of March." But
political deception can't top the duo of Robert De
Niro and Dustin Hoffman in "Wag the Dog." What
beats a fabricated war for the sake of covering up
some presidential sexual harassment?

Apocalypse When?
The Arts of the Apocalypse
ENGLISH 313
Whether you're preparing for the
Maya's supposed prediction or the
newest Rapture guess, no survivalist
would be safe without proper knowl-
edge of the "Arts of the Apocalypse."
Taught by the legendary Prof. Ralph
G. Williams (who had a role in 2010's
"Answer This!"), the required reading
features such heartwarming tomes as
"Left Behind: A Novel of the Earth's
Last Days," "The Late Great Planet
Earth" and a veritable classic - the
Bible itself!

answer to your pleas: He'll be giv-
ing a few brave souls a peek into the

Creative Adaptation
RCHUMS 242
This semester, the Residential Col-
lege is offering a creative writing class
focused on the idea of adaptation.
"Creative Adaptation" is centered not
around the commonly held idea that
you should write what you know, but
rather on the concept that you should
write what you learn. The class,
taught by Prof. Laura Thomas, seeks
to help writers find their voices and
effectively combine their stories with
the messages they wish to impart.

STEP INTO THE SALON 'TITANIC' (1997), PARAMOUNT
Does 'Titanic' sink or sail?

Here's hoping
for Hollywood

Like in the salons of 17th
and 18th century France,
this weekly installment
will feature two Daily Arts
writers discussing the finer
points of arts mediums
from at least 10 years ago.
Of course James Cameron
has found a way to make more
money without making a new
movie. Of course. This April,
Cameron's romance-disaster
drama "Titanic" returns to the
big screen ... this time in 3-D.
As the acclaimed epic sud-
denly re-emerges, I'm forced to
remember that this movie is still
undeservingly heralded as a cin-
ematic masterpiece.
"Titanic" is over three hours of
stock characters, swelling music
and sudden passion, capped with
a tear-jerking ending. Sure, the
stunningAmerican socialite with
the overpowering fiance and the
poor artist lover-boy are played
by the undoubtedly talented Kate
Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio,
but this duo didn't become
dynamic until starring side-by-
side in "Revolutionary Road" in
2008. Their acting in "Titanic"
is wooden at best, barely capable
of bringing life to their formulaic
characters.
Cameron is a wizard of spec-
tacle - he can masterfully sink
a ship or take you to a whole
new world populated with blue
people and rocks of a much-too-
obvious moniker, but in his many
years as an action-film director,
he still hasn't learned how to
write a script. This matters less-
so in his more action-packed
films, where the explosions are
exciting enough to let lines like
"I may be synthetic, but I'm not
stupid" slide.
But in "Titanic," things don't
get action-y (i.e. the ship doesn't
hit the iceberg) until about 100
minutes in. Uh-oh, Cameron has
to write real-life dialogue. And
surprise, he fails! The utteranc-
es between Rose and Jack might
DANCE
From Page 1B
Connection to
classic Indian styles
As for the multiplicity of
groups with experienced danc-
ers, another group trying to
integrate different styles is
Michigan Sahana, which spe-
cializes in Indian classical music
and dance.
India has eight recognized
forms of classical dance that
Sahana tries to represent in its
repertoire. The group's goal as
dancers is to stick to the tradi-
tional techniques and style as
much as possible.
"I feel like nowadays in the
Western world ... the modern
Indian styles are coming up,"
said LSA sophomore Vertika
Srivastava, Sahana's dance chair.
"I feel like in the Western view
when they think Indian dance,'
they think 'Oh, Bollywood.' And

that's not really what it is."
"And then also at the Uni-
versity there's a lot of (Indian)
fusion groups," she added. "We
have TAAL, Maya, which are
cool ... I think a lot of us also
do those types of dances. But I
think (for) all of us, ... our pas-
sion lies in retaining the authen-
ticity of the classical forms."
Indian classical dance forms
can be traced back hundreds of
years; many find their origins in
ancient Hindu stories. Watch-
ing classical pieces immediately
exposes the audience to char-
acters and themes prevalent in
Hinduism.
A topic often discussed at
Sahana board meetings is how
to keep the dance exciting when
the styles have been watched
and performed for centuries. At
December's performance, "Sat-
kala," one of the pieces, blended
the styles of Kathak and Odissi.
Kathak emphasizes footwork
and is performed in large, swirl-
ing skirts, while the East Indian
Odissi focuses on isolation of the
torso.
Though the forms and styles
have been adapted over time, the

"This door isn't big enough for the two of us."

elicit an emotional response
from the audience, but their
words are flat and romanticized,
solely intended to force out those
emotional responses and make
you forget these characters are
like the unfinished, underdevel-
oped outlines in Jack Dawson's
sketchbook. It's OK if you were
tricked into thinking the script
was substantive - the Academy
obviously was too, as evidenced
by Cameron's nomination for
Best Screenplay.
I do recognize that "Titanic,"
like most of Cameron's films, is
visually incredible, but let's be
real: Give anyone a $200 mil-
lion budget and they will make
a damn aesthetic masterpiece.
Disaster films are known for
breaking the bank, but a few
standout productions within
the genre, like the classic "The
Towering Inferno," managed
to succeed on more fronts than
"Titanic" while operating on a
fraction of Cameron's budget.
"Titanic" is a lazy amalgama-
tion of spectacle and romance. It
takes a catastrophic event and
reduces it to a love story backed
by a poor script. The rich girl
breaks class barriers for the
free-spirited boy, they pretend
they can fly, do it in the back-
seat of a car and then an iceberg

stories behind them tie modern
dancers to ancient traditions.
"We're living in this Western
world where there are ... differ-
ent cultures all around us," Sriv-'
astava said. "We don't all have
a class to go to in order to learn
about these stories. Through
dance ... you're just forced to
understand these on a new level
when you're asked to portray it
through your face, through your
body. And every part of your
body has to be feeling the emo-
tions of the person you're trying
to show."
Acting out the stories of
ancient Hindutexts with expres-
sive dance gives dancers a direct
connection to characters and
situations they might otherwise
have difficulty understanding.
"I feel like that makes you
connect so much more, even if
you don't believe in it," Srivas-
tavaexplained. "I have Christian
friends who do Bharatanatyam
who are equally good, and I don't
think there's any correlation ...
in that moment when you are
dancing to this music and you're
expected to be another per-
son. I feel like in that moment,
you have to believe what you're
doing."
"Those little moments, they
add up," she added. "And it's this
connection you have with this
' classical form."
Belly dancing for one and all
While Sahana appeals mostly
to students of an Indian origin,
Jackie Davis said the Arabian
Dance Ensemble provides begin-
ner lessons for students from all
over the globe.
"We don't have any interna-
tional students that have joined,"
she said. "I'm not sure why. We
get people from all over the U.S.,
like California and Chicago, and
we just all found the group and
liked belly dancing."
Routines are set to traditional
Arabic music and use recogniz-
able movements such as shim-
mying and figure eights. Dancers
wear scarves and coin belts to
accentuate the hip movements.
Davis believes that the diver-
sity of its members makes the

Arabian Dance Ensemble's rou-
tines easier for the audience to
connect with.
"It is harder to connect when
it's belly dancing just because
it isn't as mainstream," Davis
added. "Something like hip hop
is really easy because it's so
integrated in our culture today
... I think it's nice that we can
expose a dance that isn't typical
to people and maybe hope that it
would be easier to connect with
it."
Davis feels that the ensem-
ble's work is even more impor-
tant given the recent negative
attention to Arabic countries
in the media. Oftentimes, such
artistic aspects of the culture
are overlooked in light of the
global political climate.
"Especially with everything
that's happened nowadays, ...
here is something interesting
and good that you can see about
this culture," she said.
The art of Congolese dance
one of the youngest perfor-
mance groups on campus is
Amala, which performs Western
African dance, mainly of Congo-
lese influence. The word amala
means "grace" in Igbo, a Nige-
rian dialect.
"The goal of Amala is to let
our campus as a whole see the
type of dancing that is done,"
LSA sophomore Karen Coker
said. "They can see the culture
of West African dance and music
and see how exciting and fun it
is. When we perform, we're able
to show ... a bit of our culture.
You can enjoy the experience
and also learn more about it."
Coker added that dance is a
form of expression and that Afri-
can dance culture, for most audi-
ence members, is different from
anything they have seen before.
"I guess with Amala, you
don't have to be African. When
we're dancing, the people who
are watching are people who
would want to dance. It's like,
'You can do it too. You don't have
to be African in order to learn to
dance, to learn to do what we're
doing.' "
Amala aims to promote what

Coker described as "self-love
and pride and unity."
"In Amala, ' not everyone
is from the same region," she
explained. "People in Amala are
from Nigeria or Ghana or Cam-
eroon or the Congo. The mission
with Amala is to promote pride
for our different countries and
where we're from and our love
for ourselves and to show how
united we are, coming together."
The African continent is
diverse in itself, with dozens
of countries and subcultures.
Coker believes that Amala show-
cases how people from these dif-
ferent backgrounds can enjoy
themselves together and be
proud of where they are from.
Dance also provides Coker
and her peers with a respite
from academic life.
"I joined second semester of
freshman year, so it was really
helpful. It was ... a good stress
reliever, just having something
fun and being able to meet new
people," she said. "Now I always
look forward to going to practice
... after classes and everything,
I'm able to go and just have fun."
The arts promote culture
and diversity, but with dance,
simply viewing the art form is
not enough. Dancers sometimes
engage with foreign concepts
and must actively seek cultural
enrichment.
"I feel like anyone can dance.
You just have to practice," Coker
explained. "You have to practice
and get good at it and be excited.
If you have the passion and the
excitement to learn how to do it,
then you'll get it."
"You don't have to be African
in order to do African dance,"
she added. "I guess that's part
of diversity because with that
you're ... immersing yourself in
that culture. even if you're not
from there. It doesn't matter
where you're from or what your
culture is. It's just about enjoy-
ing the dance."
There is no dearth of cultures
and ethnic groups to choose
from at the University or ways
to actively engage with diversity.
Dance is one such form - a way
of learning about other cultures
even if one is not part of them.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
'Watch the Throne'is
not the king of 2011

ByANDREW ECKHOUS
Daily Arts Writer
When the media's tectonic
plates form mountains of hype
and awards are handed out pre-
maturely, there looms the possi-
bility that expectations won't be
met. We can look at the 2011-12
Philadelphia Eagles as a caution-
ary tale. Dubbed the "Dream
Team" by trigger-happy writers
and players prior to the season,
they finished at a-a, missing
the playoffs and inspiring pure,
spring water fresh schaden-
freude among haters.
Watch the Throne was granted
the same "Dream Team" treat-
ment from the moment of its
conception. Honestly, I drank
the Kool-Aid. I was sure that
Watch the Throne would beam
rap into another galaxy and
begin a renaissance. I expected
the explosions of "Armaged-
don" mixed with Hitchcock
creativity. Unfortunately, what
I got was Michael Bay direct-
ing "Avatar." Kanye and Jay-Z
didn't change the game so much
as they just rubber-stamped
what 2011 gave them. You like
dubstep? They've got dubstep.
You like Frank Ocean and Lex
Luger beats? Look no further!
I'm not trying to completely
discredit WtT as an album. The
flashy lyrics are quality and the
bombastic production comple-
ments Ye-Z's penthouse boasts
nicely. But I just can't brood
silently as WtT earns album of
the year accolades over and over
and over again. It's a well-made
album, but lacks the innovation
that both artists are known for.
Kanye's rap-opera, My Beauti-
ful Dark Twisted Fantasy, had
an artistic vision rarely seen,
and Jay-Z is a legend, in musical
prowess and business acumen,
meaning they should be held
to a higher standard. The gold-
plated album cover is appropri-
ate, but more apt might have
been a picture of them patting
each other on the back.

'U' course allows
students to design
original exhibits
By EDITH FREYER
DailyArts Writer
Most students don't normally
find themselves in laboratories
painting faux toads and casting
molds of vegetables for credit,
but the story is different for stu-
dents in an increasingly popu-
lar museum methods course. In
addition to reproducing objects
like these, students get to learn
about broader exhibit design
and even practice writing dis-
play labels.
Museum Methods 406, titled
"Special Problems in Museum
Methods," is a class more than
a quarter of a century old that
has become a University favor-
ite of many University students,
from freshmen anthropology
