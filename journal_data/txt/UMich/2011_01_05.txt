ARE RICH RODRIGUEZ'S DAYS NUMBERED?
A look at
Rodriguez's
potential
successors

Harbaugh, Hoke
among possible
replacements
By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily Sports Writer
Names of football coaches
from all over the country have
been mentioned as possible
replacements for current Michi-
gan football coach Rich Rodri-
guez if he is fired. But who are
these candidates? And are they
even interested in Michigan? A
quick breakdown of the biggest
rumored names:
Jim Harbaugh, current
Stanford football coach:
Harbaugh is the hottest name
in the football world at the
moment - at both the colle-
giate and professional levels.
It's understandable. Four years
ago, Stanford finished its sea-
son 1-11. Monday night, under
Harbaugh's tutelage, the fourth-
ranked Cardinals demolished
a red-hot Virginia Tech team,
40-12, to win the Orange Bowl
and finish the season with a
12-1 record. Stanford's only loss
of the season came to Oregon,
4 team that will play for the
national championship.
Harbaugh is an attractive
candidate to Michigan fans. He
played for legendary coach Bo
Schembechler in the mid-1980s.
He has repeatedly expressed

interest in coaching the Wolver-
ines, and over the past month,
many Michigan fans assumed he
was the front-runner to replace,
if he was fired. In the early parts
of the week, however, reports
surfaced that Harbaugh was
more interested in moving to the
NFL or remaining at Stanford.
Brady Hoke, current San
Diego State football coach:
Hoke also has some Michigan
ties, which automatically links
his name to the potential coach-
ing vacancy in Ann Arbor. He
was a defensive line/associ-
ate head coach at Michigan for
eight years under head coach
Lloyd Carr, most notably dur-
ing the 1997 national champion-
ship season. Hoke then became
a head coach at Ball State, his
alma mater, and he has coached
at San Diego State for the past
two years.
He's a defensive-minded
coach - a phrase that should
sound nice to Michigan fans -
and he has a history of making
the most of the limited talent on
his teams. He turned Ball State
into a MAC power, and after
going 4-8 last season at SDSU,
his Aztecs finished 9-4 this year
with a Poinsetta Bowl victory.
If reports taking Harbaugh out
of the equation are true, Hoke
could be the new favorite.
Les Miles, current Loui-
siana State football coach:
Miles was the big name circling

Rodriguez, Brandon
to meet again today
to talk job status
By TIM ROHAN
Daily SportsEditor
One by one, those close to Mich-
igan coach Rich Rodriguez filed
out of Schembechler Hall yester-
day afternoon as reports circulat-
ed that Michigan Athletic Director
Dave Brandon decided to fire the

embattled coach.
The Detroit Free Press and Fox
2 Detroit reported .that Brandon
had already decided to fire his
coach who had a15-22 record in his
three seasons inAnn Arbor.
So the flood of questions began
in an attempt to get to the bottom
of Rodriguez's status. By the end of
the day, though, everyone was still
left without any firm answers.
First it was his wife, Rita, who
walked in and out, managing a
smile as she told reporters that she
had not been told anything regard-

ing her husband's job - that was
before nightfall.
The snowflakes started falling
and fluttered throughout the after-
noon and into the evening-- at just
as frequent a pace as the differing
reports Rodriguez's future.
Then Michigan offensive coor-
dinator Calvin Magee, who has
been an assistant under Rodriguez
for the past 10 seasons, refused to
comment as well.
"I am not talking to you guys
today," he said. Then ,when asked
if he had a minute, Magee tersely

responded: "NoI do not."
Minutes later, Michigan defen-
sive coordinator Greg Robinson
left the building, also refusing to
take part in the talk of the day.
"I've got all day, but not today,"
Robinson said with a smirk. "See
ya guys."
But the whirlwind of news is
not done yet. The Associated Press
reported that Brandon has not yet
made up his mind on whether to
keep Rodriguez or fire him. Bran-
don met with Rodriguez for more

Moving toward a cure

With a joint appointment in the
School of Kinesiology and LSA,
Rachael Seidler, a University pro-
fessor of movement science and
psychology, is taking her work
outside the classroom to improve
medical treatment for the elderly
and those afflicted with Parkin-
son's disease.
Seidler's research focuses on
understanding how the brain con-
trols movement. She said she works
with elderly people to determine the
effects of aging on structural chang-
es in the brain.
"What my work is showing is that
as people age, that structure that is
bridging the two sides of the brain
breaks down and you actually get
more interference between the two
sides of the brain and what they're
trying to do," she said.
Though numerous studies are
required to make an impact in
the field, Seidler said her current

research on how the brain changes
with Parkinson's disease aims to
identify whether medications for
the disease help patients or actu-
ally worsen the condition. With this
identification, Seidler said she hopes
to discern which areas of treatment
need to be improved.
As an undergraduate, Seidler
majored in exercise science and
minored in biology at the University
of Oregon. She continued her edu-
cation at Arizona State University,
completing a master's in biomechan-
ics and a doctorate in motor control
before going to the University of
Minnesota for post-doctoraltraining
in neuroscience.
Seidler said she came to the Uni-
versity of Michigan in 2001 because
of its reputation for research. She
said she enjoys the multi-faceted
nature of her job, which includes
working on her own research and
teaching students.

"Focusing on my research allows
me to hopefully make a difference in
people's lives, people with movement
disorders, or to better understand
changes with age," she said. "At the
same time Ireally enjoy teaching and
trying to impart this knowledge on
students and helping them to achieve
their own career goals and even to
help them identify what their career
goals are."
Seidler added that she appreciates
working as a professor in the School
of Kinesiology and in the Depart-
ment of Psychology because it allows
her to interact with people who have
different interests.
"I really like having the joint
appointment because I get exposure
to lots of different colleagues, and
a large number and wide range of
students in comparison to probably
what most faculty interact with," she
said.

House Republicans .
ask Obama to trim
federal spending

Obama challenged
to join GOP push to
make budget cuts
WASHINGTON (AP) - On the
brink of power, House Republi-
cans challenged President Barack
Obama yesterday to join them in a
drive to cut federal spending, ban
earmarks for favored projects and
overhaul the nation's tax code.
At the same time, incoming
House Majority Leader Eric Can-
tor, R-Va., conceded the new GOP
majority intends to bypass its own
new rules when it votes next week
to wipe out the health care law
approved by Democrats in 2010.
"We just need to repeal it,"
Cantor said of the effort to fulfill
one of the party's main campaign
promises from last fall.
Republicans, their ranks
expanded by tea party-backed
freshmen, take control of the
House when the 112th Congress
convenes at noon today. One of the
first orders of business will be the
election of Ohio Republican John
Boehner as speaker, replacing
Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
In a celebratory mood, House
Republicans met for nearly three
hours during the day as they
looked ahead to their two-year
term of office. GOP freshmen have
emphasized the need to reduce
the deficit, but there are limits to
how far the caucus is willing to go.
Ten-year veteran Rep. Jeff Flake,
R-Ariz., said his colleagues defeat-
ed his proposal to use savings
from spending cuts only for deficit
reduction, as opposed to shifting
some money to other government
programs.
Across the Capitol, Demo-
crats retained their majority in
the November elections.. But the
60 Senate seats they controlled
two years ago - enough to push
through much of Obama's agenda
- will fall to 53.
That will make it harder to
enact legislation Obama still

seeks. But it gives them more than
enough clout to block passage of
bills like the health care repeal
that House Republicans desire.
Obama, speaking with report-
ers aboard Air Force One as he flew
home from a year-end vacation in
Hawaii, predicted Republicans
would "play to their (political)
base" initially.
He added, "But I'm pretty con-
fident that they're going to recog-
nize that our job is to govern and
make sure that we are delivering
jobs for the American people."
He said the two sides can build
on the lame duck session of Con-
gress in December, when they
agreed on a compromise to pre-
vent income taxes from rising, to
extend unemployment benefits
and to enact a Social Security tax
cut that took effect on Saturday.
Cantor challenged and chided
Obama by turn in a news confer-
ence in which he said the GOP
envisions a "cut and grow major-
ity" to reduce government spend-
ing and regulations and benefit the
economy.
The first spending cut vote
is set for tomorrow, a 5 percent
reduction in the amount ticketed
for lawmakers' and committees'
offices as well as leadership staff.
Aides estimated the savings at $35
million over the next nine months.
Republicans have pledged to
vote on bills that cut spending at
least once a week.
Obama is expected to deliver his
State of the Union Address before
a joint session of Congress on Jan.
25, and Cantor said he was "look-
ing to see some significant spend-
ing cuts proposed by the president
that we can work on together."
He also said he hopes Obama
will prevail on Senate Democrats
to ban earmarks, which are funds
dedicated to specific pet projects
of individual lawmakers.
He added, "Tax reform could be
a significant boost. and I'm hope-
ful and expecting the president"
will speak on that subject as well.
Cantor also said he was "hopeful

the president will re-evaluate his
position on regulations."
Republicans argue that the
economy suffers from over-reg-
ulation by the government, high-
lighting the health care bill as one
example.
Cantor's comments under-
scored the change that has
occurred in the political land-
scape since the last election.
Instead of merely opposing
Obama's every proposal, as they
did in 2009 and 2010, Republicans
must compromise with him if they
are to show results in their drive
to cut spending.
Yet their eagerness to vote
quickly on repealing the health
care bill is in line with a no-com-
promise position articulated by
the tea party forces that helped
propel many GOP challengers to
victory.
Republicans have the votes to
pass the health care repeal bill
though the House. Yet the action
is largely symbolic, since Demo-
cratic leaders have already pro-
nounced it dead on arrival in the
Senate.
And Democrats made it clear
they intend to make the House
vote as uncomfortable as possible
for Republicans, too.
"Under the Republican repeal
effort, insurance companies
would once again be able to drop
people when they get sick.. Chil-
dren with pre-existing conditions
would be denied coverage," said
Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz,
D-Fla. "Young people will not be
able to stay on their parents' insur-
ance until they're age 26. Pregnant
women and breast cancer survi-
vors could be denied coverage.
Seniors will face an increase in
their prescription drug costs, mil-
lions thrown back into the Medi-
care Part D doughnut hole."
One of the first votes on
Wednesday will be enactment
of a series of rules changes that
Republicans crafted to increase
openness in Congress' proceed-
ings.

Hundreds of dead birds lie along the side of the Morganza Highway in Pointe Coupee Parish, La.
Thousands of blackbirds
eris in Southern U.S.

According to experts,
mass bird deaths are
not uncommon
NEW ORLEANS (AP) - It
isn't easy being a blackbird in
the South.
First, New Year's Eve fireworks
were blamed in central Arkansas
for making thousands of black-
birds confused, crashing into
homes, cars and each other. Then
300 miles to the south in Loui-
siana, power lines likely killed
about 450 birds, littering a high-
way near Baton Rouge.
It's almost certainly a coinci-
dence the events happened within
days of each other, Louisiana's state
wildlife veterinarian Jim LaCour
said yesterday. "I haven't found
anything to link the two at this
point."
Mass bird deaths aren't
uncommon. The U.S. Geological
Service's website listed about 90
mass deaths of birds and other
wildlife from June through Dec.
12. There were five deaths of at
least 1,000 birds, with the larg-
est near Houston, Minn., where
parasite infestations killed about
4,000 water birds between Sept.

6 and Nov. 26.
In Louisiana, the birds died
sometime late Sunday or early
Monday in the rural Pointe Cou-
pee Parish community of Labarre,
about 30 miles northwest of Baton
Rouge. The birds - a mixed
flock of red-winged blackbirds,
brown-headed cowbirds, grack-
les and starlings - may have hita
power line or vehicles in the dark,
LaCour said. Two dozen of them
had head, neck, beak or back inju-
ries.
About 50 dead birds were near
a power line 30 or 40 feet from
Louisiana Highway 1. About
a quarter-mile away, a second
group of 400 or more stretched
from the power line and across
the highway, he said.
Dan Cristol, a biology professor
and co-founder of the Institute for
Integrative Bird Behavior Studies
at the College of William & Mary,
said the Louisiana birds may have
been ill or startled from their
roost, then hit the power line.
"They don't hita power line for
no reason," he said.
In Beebe, New Year's revelers
spent the holiday weekend clean-
ing up dead red-winged black-
birds. Some speculated that bad
weather was to blame. Others said

one confused bird could have led
the group in a fatal plunge. A few
spooked schoolkids guessed the
birds committed mass suicide.
Officials acknowledged,
though, they may never know
exactly what caused the large
number of deaths.
Cristol was skeptical of the
fireworks theory, unless "some-
body blew something into the
roost, literally blowing the birds
into the sky."
Wildlife officials in both
Arkansas and Louisiana sent
carcasses to researchers at the
National Wildlife Health Center
in Madison, Wis. and the Univer-
sity of Georgia.
LaCour said he didn't expect
results for at least two or three
weeks.
In 1999, several thousand
grackles fell from the sky and
staggered about before dying
in north Louisiana. It took five
months to get the diagnosis: an
E. coli infection of the air sacs in
their skulls.
"I hope things go faster than
that," said Paul Slota, branch chief
for the National Wildlife Health
Center in Madison, Wis. He said
necropsies of the Arkansas birds
beganyesterday afternoon.

NEWS BRIEFS

Texas man declared
innocent after 30
years in prison
A Texas man declared innocent
yesterday after 30 years in prison
had at least two chances to make
parole and be set free - if only he
would admit he was a sex offender.
But Cornelius Dupree Jr. refused
to do so, doggedly maintaining his
innocence in a 1979 rape and rob-
bery, in the process serving more
time for a crime he didn't commit
than any other Texas inmate exon-
erated by DNA evidence.
"Whatever your truth is, you
have to stick with it," Dupree, 51,
said yesterday, minutes after a Dal-
las judge overturned his conviction.
Nationally, only two others
exonerated by DNA evidence spent
more time in prison, according to
the Innocence Project, a New York
legal center that specializes in
wrongful conviction cases and rep-
resented Dupree. James Bain was
wrongly imprisoned for 35 years in
Florida, and Lawrence McKinney
spent more than 31 years in a Ten-
nessee prison.

New law labels
interns 'highly

Civil rights advocates are blast-

interns as "highly qualified" teach-
ers and regularly assign them to
schools with mostly poor, minority
students.
The measure, which remains in
effect until the end of the 2012-13
school year, was signed Dec. 22 by
President Barack Obama as part of
an unrelated federal spending bill.
The legislation nullifies a Sept.
27 decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, which ruled that
California illegally classified thou-
sands of teachers in training as
"highly qualified" inviolation of the
federal No Child Left Behind Act.
Under that law, all students are
supposed to be taught by "high-
ly qualified" teachers who have
earned state teaching credentials,
but a 2004 Bush administration
policy allowed states to give that
status to interns working toward
certification.
WASHINGTON
On her last day as
speaker, Pelosi says
she has 'no regrets'
Democrat Nancy Pelosi said she
had no regrets on her last day as
House speaker yesterday, a reign
that lasted four years and is end-
ing after the November elections.
Pelosi said yesterday she looks
forward to leading a loyal but tena-
cious opposition in the House. She
started by calling Republicans hyp-
ocrites for trying to repeal Presi-
dent Barack Obama's health care
overhaul, saying it would add to the

federal budget deficit.
Republicans won the House
majority in the November elec-
tions and John Boehner of Ohio
will be sworn in as the new speak-
er today. Pelosi - the first female
speaker - will be demoted to
minority leader.

Australian city
receives emergency
food, supplies after
devastating flood
A military flight rushed Monday
to restock an Australian city before
it was cut off by floodwaters that
have turned a huge swath of the
Outback into a lake, while police
confirmed two more deaths in the
crisis.
Drenching rain that started
before Christmas has flooded an
area the size of France and Ger-
many combined in northeastern
Queensland state. Rivers are over-
flowing and at least 22 towns and
cities in the farming region are
inundated.
In the coastal city of Rockhamp-
ton, waters from the still-swelling
Fitzroy River closed the airport
and cut the main highway to the
state capital of Brisbane. Scores of
families abandoned their homes for
relief centers on high ground.
By Monday night, floodwaters
had inundated the last route into
the city, Queensland Premier Anna
Bligh said.

U.S. not invited to see
Iranian nuclear sites

AS

State Dept. jokingly
calls event 'magical
mystery tour'
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - Iran
said yesterday it had invited the
European Union and some other
world powers - but apparently
not chief critic the United States
- to tour nuclear sites before the
next round of international talks
in late January on its disputed
nuclear program.
The Associated Press reported
the invitation to tour the facilities
on Monday, citing a letter from a
senior Iranian envoy that suggest-
ed Jan. 15-16 for the visit. A diplo-
mat familiar with the letter said
Iran invited Russia, China, Egypt,
the group of nonaligned nations
at the U.N.'s International Atom-
ic Energy Agency, Cuba, Arab
League members at the IAEA, and
Hungary, which currently holds
the rotating EU presidency.
Iran's economy appears to be
struggling under the weight of
four rounds of international sanc-
tions over its nuclear program,

which the West suspects is aimed
at producing weapons though
Tehran denies that. Iran returned
last month to nuclear talks with
the so-called 5+1 countries - the
United States, Britain, France,
Russia and China, plus Germany
- which hold sway over the sanc-
tions. And the invitation to visit
nuclear sites may also be a sign
that Tehran is looking for ways to
ease its financial pain.
The State Department mocked
Iran's offer, calling it a "magical
mystery tour." Spokesman P.J.
Crowley said the offer is no sub-
stitute for Iran fully cooperating
with the U.N. nuclear watchdog to
prove that its nuclear program is
strictly for peaceful purposes and
not to build a bomb.
Asked by reporters how the
U.S. felt about being excluded
from Iran's invitation, Crowley
responded sarcastically by saying:
"We're just crushed." While he
did not urge others to decline the
invitation, he did say there is no
reason for any country to attend.
Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Ramin Mehman-
parast confirmed the invitation

yesterday, saying it went to "the
EU, the nonaligned movement
and representatives from 5+1
countries." He said Iran would
name the countries later and
added that the invitation was
a sign of Iran's "good will" and
greater transparency about its
nuclear program.
Mehmanparast did not give a
firm date, but said the tour would
take place before the January
round of nuclear talks.
An Iranian official speak-
ing from a European capital said
facilities to be visited include the
uranium enrichment facility at
Natanz and the Arak site where
Tehran is building a plutonium-
producing heavy water reactor.
Both facilities are considered
suspect by the West because they
could be used to make the fissile
core of nuclear warheads; Teh-
ran's refusal to shut them down
has triggered U.N. Security Coun-
cil sanctions.
The new round of negotiations
is meant to explore whether there
is common ground for more sub-
stantive talks on Iran's nuclear
program.

Israel focuses on clean e nergy

As country moves
away from oil,
"Clean-tech" sector
on the rise
JERUSALEM (AP) - After a
successful run of high-tech and
computer-related innovation,
Israel is focusing its ambitions on
the next big thing - preparing the
world for life without coal and oil.
Israel is driving to become a
world leader in alternative energy,
with the government throwing
its support to encourage cutting-
edge technologies. The number
of private entrepreneurs entering
the so-called "clean-tech" sector
has swelled dramatically.
Already, a number of firms are
moving to roll out new ideas. Per-

haps the country's best known
clean-tech company - Project
Better Place - aims next year to
activate a network of charging sta-
tionsforelectric cars across Israel,
which would be one of the most
extensive such grids in the world.
Others are still in early stages.
On a 10-meter (yard) stretch of
a north Israel highway, the firm
Innowattech tested out its system
of tile-like generators, which are
installed under roads and convert
the wgight and motion of passing
vehicles into electricity. It is now
looking to expand, claiming that a
kilometer-long (0.6-mile) lane of
its generators could power more
than 200 households.
Alex Klein, an analyst at
Emerging Energy Research, a
Cambridge, Mass., research firm,
said Israel - a country of fewer
than 8 million people - has in a

way benefited from its small size,
forcing it to develop products for
export.
"Given that it has a small mar-
ketlocally, its role will continue to
be innovating new next-genera-
tion technology. Pound for pound
it is a pretty keyincubator of tech-
nologies," he said.
Israel already has a formidable
track record. Bolstered in large
part by veterans of shadowy high-
tech military units, the country
helped develop such innovations
as instant messaging, Internet
telephony and wireless computer
chips.
The government is now push-
ing for that entrepreneurial drive
to be directed into environmen-
tally clean technologies, not only
as an economic opportunity butas
a necessity for an arid, resource-
poor nation.

MANAGING EDITOR

Unsigned editorials reflect the official position of the Daily's editorial board. All other signed articles
and illustrations represent solely the views of their authors.
Revitalizing activism
New editors' objectives for 2011 editorial page
hile The Michigan Daily is historically known as a lib-
eral newspaper, many fail to remember its progressive
- and albeit controversial - era. Throughout the 1950s
and 1960s, the Daily's editorial page was characterized by strong
student activism. The Daily heavily questioned not only the Uni-
versity administration, but also the federal government. Its radical
statements were so controversial that the paper received coverage
from national media outlets. Michigan currently has one of the
worst economies and job markets in the nation and, just this past
weekend, the federal government had a large shift in political party
power. But in spite of all this, the spirit of activism both on campus
and in the Daily has been somewhat subdued. Our plan is to reverse
this trend.

Not enough course guidance

S

The Daily is an entirely student-run news-
paper. But that doesn't mean our stories
exist exclusively on campus. Between an
expansive alumni base and national media
attention, the voice of the Daily has been
widely heard. When the Daily first broke the
news of assistant attorney general Andrew
Shirvell's hateful blog against Michigan Stu-
dent Assembly President Chris Armstrong,
the editorial staff called for Shirvell's remov-
al from office. The Daily coverage preceded a
string of national news coverage of the issue
and Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox
later relieved Shirvell from his duties.
The editorial page, as demonstrated, has
a realistic potential to promote concrete
change on campus. And this power is not
taken lightly. The opinion section exists to
argue the positions of all types of students on
campus. Whether it's calling for the reason-
able protection of a campus leader, support-
ing the implementation of an open housing
option in the residence halls or calling for
the repeal of the future campus-wide smok-
ing ban, the editorial page serves as a voice
for diverse and divisive issues. Our goal is to
continue to check the University's decisions
while also stirring debate on campus.
Along with members of the Daily's edito-
rial board, we will examine what issues are
most important to students - both on a local

and national level - and use editorials to
discuss realistic ways of approaching these
different topics. While Daily precedent will
always be taken into account, we will also
consider new circumstances and our unique
perspective as students in the 21st century.
But the only way the editorial page can be a
relevant forum for discussion and new ideas
is if students throughout campus contribute
their opinions. We encourage students from
all types of backgrounds to submit letters
to the editor or viewpoints, so that the page
communicates all the different facets of an
issue and not just one side.
Throughout our tenure as the editorial
page editors, we will strive to return the edi-
torial page to its progressive roots. The Daily
made a name for itself by not being afraid to
stir up controversy and by strongly defend-
ing and standing by its views. In the midst
of economic despair and social conflicts, our
goal is to make the page an outlet for a voice
that is young, informed and eager to create
change.

T helastthing allofus didbefore
leaving for break, other than
take a few finals, was select
our courses for
the coming semes-
ter. For freshmen
it was infuriating,
for sophomores it
was disappointing,
for juniors it was a
joy and for seniors
it was bittersweet.
While the pro-
cess isn't perfect JEFF
and doesn't allow WOJCIK
everyone to take
what they want
and when they
want, for the most part it's received
as fair. But most students don't enjoy
the surprise of Professor Schreier's
Psych 111 course filling up four days
before their registration time.
If you're like me, you left freshman
summer orientation vexed over your
upcoming fall semester schedule and
rushed home to pick the courses you
would take for the rest of your under-
graduate career. Before you even
moved into your residence hall, you
took great time and care in finding
courses that you would select in your
sophomore and junior (and maybe
even senior) semesters, when you
would have higher priority.
Unfortunately, once you achieve
the prized honor of registering before
seemingly everyone else, you will.
continue to find frustration in course
selection. You will most likely not be
disappointed in the professor or the
curriculum, but you might be frus-
trated about your expectations of the
course. Currently, the course guide
only allows you to search by depart-
ments, distribution requirements,
credit totals, keywords and other
tags. While the technology works and
people typically find the courses they
need to take to complete their degree
and fulfill their academic curiosity,

the information in the course guide is
arguably limited.
Unless it's included in the brief
course description, students are usu-
ally left clueless as to the number
of papers in the course, the style of
exams, the necessity of attendance
and a host of other factors that would
be helpful in fleshing out their next
semester. Some students use older.
siblings, sorority sisters or other
sources of course information to
select classes based on unique criteria,
but not everyone has these resources
available. With this in mind, LSA
Student Government thinks instruc-
tors should, and likely want to, pro-
vide more information and details in
the course guide about the courses
they're teaching. The information will
help students select courses based
on factors beyond distribution and
upper-level writing requirements,
and instead look for courses based on
teaching style, time commitment and
instructor expectations.
Whether you select your cours-
es because they're not on Fridays,
because they complete your humani-
ties requirement, because the title
sounds appetizing or because you
read every description of the GEOS-
CI electives - and this one really
spoke to you - LSA-SG is working
to improve the course guide to bet-
ter help you find the classes that fit
your needs and wants. We're work-
ing with LSA to indicate when some
gateway courses will be offered in the
future, so that you can plan when to
take a course you cannot get into this
semester. We're petitioning for the
incorporation of Michigan Student
Assembly's Advice online right into
the course guide, so you can make
informed choices about how helpful
and difficult your professors might
be. Above all, we're striving to attach
draft syllabi to course descriptions
so that you can know how you will
be evaluated over the next 16 weeks

of class and how your grade will be
determined. These efforts will help
you find the options you want more
quickly and prevent you from choos-
ing courses that don't meet your
expectations.
We need your help in making these
improvements. In the November 2010
LSA-SG election, 1,846 of 2,031 (91
percent) LSA students who voted in
the election said they would like to
use a draft syllabus when choosing
their courses. Though LSA students
voted to tell us what things should
be altered, we still want to hear from
you to know what tweaks and chang-
es can be made to make your course
selection experience better.
We probably won't be able to

is frustrating.*
make freshmen register any earlier,
and we can't make Orgo any easier.
What we can do is collect all the sug-
gestions from students and partner
with the dean's office to improve the
course guide and help you pick the
best schedule possible. Please e-mail
us at academics@umich.edu, so we
can forward your thoughts and con-
cerns about the course guide to those
responsible for changing it. College
administrators, faculty and staff
all want students to have the best
resource to find course options, so
please tell us how you would like to
search for classes.

Don't drink the water

January 12, January 18, January 24, February
1. These dates comprise the spectrum of when
my friends return to school for the start of sec-
ond semester. When I mentioned to them that
my winter break ends on January 5, my friends
were aghast by how little time I had at home
with my family. They all wondered how their
breaks could be four, five, even six weeks long
when mine barely cracked three weeks.
I could easily complain about this problem.
My family friend, who teaches high school
math, and my sister, a high school sophomore,
both complain incessantly that their breaks are
too short. Even my 8-year-old neighbor whines
that her break from the third grade is way too
short for her liking. So instead of complaining
about the length of our winter break, I chal-
lenge the University to explain the reasoning
behind the schedule. I implore administrators
to explain why our winter break is at most three
weeks, why spring break is in February or even
why the school year ends in April - resulting
in a four-month summer. If the University is
going to operate on such an odd schedule, then
it's only fair that the student body is privy to the
calendar's motivating logic.
Before I began writing this piece, I did some
research on the University website to see if I
could find any information that explained our
schedule. No luck. Even on the various message
boards and third-party pages on the Internet, I
could not find a succinct explanation of the for-
mation of our schedule. one of the most amaz-
ing things about the University that I noticed
during my first year here was the vast amount
of resources available to the student body. From
e-mail crime alerts, to the career development
office, to even the arrows in the Barnes and
Noble book store pointing where to pick up pre-
viously purchased books, the University does an

incredible job making a wide variety of informa-
tion available to the student body. All this makes
the lack of an explanation of the formation of
the academic calendar seem incredibly counter-
intuitive to the University's existing state of
resourcefulness.
I hesitate to use the word "arbitrary" when
discussing the University's academic calendar.
"Arbitrary," better describes my ideas surround-
ing the University's schedule. For example, why
can't we have an extra week during winter
break and tack that class time on to the end of
the winter term? Or, why can't the spring and
summer terms be consolidated into one term,
which would allow the winter term to end later
and allow for longer breaks? But again, those
are completely arbitrary ideas, formed off the
top of my head with little knowledge of how a
large University actually functions. Though it
would likely be a laughable Saturday Night Live
skit, I'm confident that the University Board
of Regents doesn't sit around and hypothesize
about the dates for our academic calendar.
For a school of the University's size to operate
smoothly, no decision the University of Michi-
gan makes can truly be arbitrary. There has to
be a definitive reason behind the dates of our
academic calendar. Given that the only infor-
mation the University publishes on the online
schedule is the academic calendar for the next
three years, there is clearly a pre-existing sys-
tem. Instead of allowing the student body to
wonder, and therefore conjure their own ideas
as to what the schedule should be, the Univer-
sity should make its reasoning transparent. If
there is in fact a method to the madness of our
academic schedule, students and professors
have every right to know.

t's required by law that tobacco
products bear the U. S. Surgeon
General's
warning, which
offers a friendly
reminder: If you
use tobacco, you ;
will get cancer and
you will die. Well, , . '
maybe the pack-
ages don't say that
exactly, but they ---
might as well. The JOE
warning is there
to make users fully SUGIYAMA
aware of the health
risks and allows
each person to
make his or her own decision about
tobacco use.
But what would happen if the same
label was put on something that you
had no choice but to use - something
like water. If every water faucet, drink-
ing fountain and showerhead bore a
skull and crossbones label, it might
be a little disconcerting. But it seems
as though this severe course of action
might be necessary after a well-known
carcinogen was found in tap water in
Ann Arbor, along with 31 other cities
around the United States.
According to the Environmental
Working Group - a non-profit organi-
zation dedicated to public safety from
toxic chemicals - there are alarming
amounts of hexavalent chromium (Cr-
6) in the drinking water of many U.S.
cities. Hexavalent chromium is a toxin
that, if ingested, increases a person's
risk of gastrointestinal cancer and
increases concentrations of chromium
in body tissue.
The group's study tested unfiltered
water samples - from places like
libraries, homes and hospitals - in 35
cities for Cr-6. California is currently

the only state requiring water com-
panies to test for the toxin and. the
state has determined that 0.06 parts.
per billion should be the safest maxi-
mum allowable concentration. But
the 35 cities tested averaged about
three times this amount. Ann Arbor
had the 12th highest concentration
among those tested at 0.21 ppb.
This is a surprising result after the
same chemical made such a big splash
in the mid-1990s. Hexavalent chro-
mium is the toxin that the California
company, Pacific Gas & Electric, was
sued $330 million for having in their
water. The toxin was deemed respon-
sible for the devastation to the health
of the residents in Hinkley, Calif. The
case was the basis of the 2000 movie
"Erin Brockovich," which brought
even more awareness to the topic.
As a result of the national expo-
sure to this issue, the Environmental
Protection Agency tested Cr-6, and
found it to have carcinogenic effects.
But even with this classification as
a threat to humans, the EPA has not
seen fit to regulate - or even require
testing for - the amount of Cr-6 in
tap water.
There is a federal limit of 100 ppb
of total chromium for tap water, but
this means that any form of chromium
- including the toxic Cr-6 - counts
toward this total sum of 100 ppb. So if
a sample of water meets the EPA regu-
lation for chromium concentration
with Cr-6 only, the water would have
over 1600 times the suggested amount
of the carcinogen. It's almost like the
EPA is playing Russian roulette with
toxic chemicals. Only the study by the
EWG has uncovered that the cylinder
is full about 90 percent of the time.
One might think that the Safe
Drinking Water Act of the 1970s
would help with this predicament

we're facing. But adding to the list
of chemicals to be regulated by the
SDWA isn't the speediest process,
primarily because of all the research
that must occur before a chemical
is deemed a toxin. I guess that call-
ing something a "likely carcinogen
to humans" isn't enough for the EPA.
Cr-6 has been proven to have toxic
effects on people and animals, so
what is stopping it from becoming
blacklisted by the EPA? Making Cr-6
a federally regulated chemical could
save countless lives.
Carcinogen was
found in Ann
Arbor's tap water.
If the EPA won't step in at the fed-
eral level, the state of Michigan or
even the city of Ann Arbor must do
something. It's both disturbing and
embarrassing that our city is men-
tioned in this report. It's even more
disturbingthat we were listed as hav-
ing three times the suggested limit
of a known carcinogen in our drink-
ing water. Ann Arbor needs to attack
this issue head on. Not just for the
safety of its own citizens, but to cre-
ate a path for cities all over the U.S.
to follow. We can't wait on the EPA
to show us the way out of this poten-
tially deadly situation. Cr-6 should be
strictly regulated by the city of Ann
Arbor and the state to avoid any last-
ing repercussions.

City to review ordinance on Jan.18

From Page 1A
Arbor City Council Member Sabra
Briere (D-Ward 1), who played a
significant role in proposing the
revisions, explained the coun-
cil's reasoning behind the three
most significant revisions. Briere
said she supports the increase in
the number of dispensaries and
cultivation facilities since they
can result in economic growth
throughout the city.
"There's a lot of economic
potential in this business," Briere
said.
The second revision involves
removing a section from the ordi-
nance that would have required
home growers to register with the
city.
Briere said this requirement
would likely have done more
harm than good, since it would
have deterred home growers from
applying for city inspections for

fear of having their information
recorded on an official list.
"We felt making it possible
for people to be inspected by city
building inspectors but not have
their name appear on a list ... was
agood idea," Briere said.
The final revision would make
it possible for people charged
with drug-related misdemeanors
to open a dispensary. This change
was especially important, Briere
said, since she expects some peo-
ple who will be qualified to open
dispensaries won't have spotless
legal records.
"We are talking about some-
thing that isn't 100 percent legal,"
Briere said. "We can't expect the
people doing it to be 100 percent
law-abiding."
However, the proposed ordi-
nance still prohibits people
charged with any felony from
operating a cultivation facility or
dispensary. They also wouldn't be

able to serve as home growers.
The current ordinance also
states that all cultivation facilities
and dispensaries must have secu-
rity cameras and alarms in the
areas, in addition to an overnight
system that secures .the medical
marijuana. In adherence to the
guidelines in the current ordi-
nance, the cultivation facilities
would have to prove there is a ven-
tilation system in place that deters
marijuana fumes.
The revised ordinance will
appear before City Council for a
first reading at its Jan. 18 meeting,
Briere said.
If approved at that meetifig, the
ordinance will advance to a pub-
lic hearing and a second reading
before being voted on. If passed,
the ordinance will followa tempo-
rary moratorium expiring Jan. 31
that regulates medical marijuana
in the city, according to a Dec. 7,
2010 Michigan Daily article.

than three hours on Tuesday after-
noon, according to reports, to dis-
cuss Rodriguez's future with the
program. But no official announce-
ment came down from Brandon.
According to the AP, the two will
meet again today.
Their first meeting came just
three days after the worst bowl loss
in Michigan history - the 52-14
throttling at the hands of Mis-
sissippi State on New Year's Day.
Leading up to the game, Rodriguez
didn't mention the elephant in the
room - his uncertain status as
head coach - until the day before
the Gator Bowl. Junior defensive
tackle Mike Martin said he really
hasn't seen it wear it on Rodriguez.
"He never mentioned it or talked
about it because he felt that we as
a team, we were working," Mar-
tin said after the Gator Bowl. "It
didn't seem like it was affecting
us in practice and things like that.
But he's a human. He's a man. Put-
ting constant stress on someone is

going to naturally wear down on'
someone. He's such a strong man.
All of these coaches are strong
people. That wasn't something we
could see. ... They've been in the
fire. I give it to them."
By yesterday evening, the Uni-
versity's Athletic Department
released a statement deflecting any
of the reports about Rodriguez's
status and deferred to Brandon's
forthcoming official announce-
ment.
"Everything that is being
reported is media speculation
at this point," Michigan Associ-
ate Athletic Director Dave Ablauf
wrote in the statement. "The
definitive voice on this matter is
Dave Brandon and he has not and
will not speak publicly until a final
decision has been made. I will let
you know when Dave is prepared
to comment."
Sources, who wished to remain
anonymous, told the Daily that a
team meeting originally scheduled
for 7 p.m. yesterday was re-sched-
uled to 4 p.m. today. Any deci-

sion regarding Rodriguez's future
could be announced during the
meeting with the entire team.
Former Michigan quarterback
and current Stanford coach Jim
Harbaugh may be out of the run-
ning to replace Rodriguez if he
is fired. Multiple reports said
Harbaugh would prefer to stay at
Stanford or bolt to the NFL before
returning to his alma mater. And,
John Harbaugh - who coaches the
Baltimore Ravens - doesn't think
his brother will coach the Wolver-
ines if a spot is open.
"I don't know what he's going
to do," John Harbaugh said on his
radio show on WBAL yesterday. "I
think the Michigan thing is done
now. I don't think he's interested
in doing that, which is hard for him
because he loves Michigan. But it
says a lot about Stanford and we'll
just see what happens.
But for now, Rodriguez is still
the coachofthe Wolverines despite
conflicting reports as to whether
Brandon has already made his
decision.


SALARY REPORT
From Page 1A
and deans declined merit-based
salary increases. At the time, fac-
ulty wages increased on average
by 2.3 percent and staff wages
increased by 0.7 percent, which
was reported by a 2009 University
press release on the salary report
as one of the lowest increases in
the past decade. However, from
2008-2009, faculty and staff not
belonging to a union earned wages
that increased by 4.4 percent and
,3.2 percent, respectively.
The increases are detailed
in the University's Faculty and
Staff Disclosure Report, which is
released on a yearly basis, and was
made public for the 2010-2011 aca-
demic year on Dec. 20, 2010.
The University's salary report
listed Ora Pescovitz, executive
vice president for medical affairs
at the University, as having the
highest base compensation for the
second year in a row. Pescovitz
will earn $721,000 for 2010-2011,
which is a 3-percent increase
'from her previous year's salary of
$700,000. She could also receive
$100,000 in deferred compensa-
tion each year, in addition to a
performance bonus, according to
a Dec. 24, 2009 Michigan Daily
article.
Douglas Strong, chief execu-
tive officer of the University's
Hospitals and Health Centers,
now holds the second highest base
salary at the University. Strong
received a raise of 9.8 percent
over his salary last year to earn
$600,000, according to the salary
DREAM ACT
From Page 1A
University Consortium for
Political and Social Research,
said the DREAM Act is one part
of immigration reform that would
allow people to see the issue as
having a larger scope than border
security and law enforcement.
The bill would permit illegal
immigrants who graduate from
U.S. high schools to stay in the
country if they complete two
years of military service or two
years at a higher education insti-
tution. In order for the DREAM
Act to apply, they would have had
to enter the U.S. before the age of
16 and reside here for five years.
Garcia said in late December
that he believes the DREAM Act
will now be difficult to pass since
Republicans take the House this
month and there were few con-
servative representatives who
voted for the bill on Dec. 8. Eight
Republicans voted in support of
the bill when it went for a vote
in the House on that date, and 20
chose not to vote, according to a
Dec. 9 Michigan Daily article.
Garcia said in an interview in
late November that the DREAM
Act should be passed because it
would produce a new generation
of workers and highly-educated
citizens to fill vacant jobs as the
current workforce moves toward
retirement.
Citing America's history as a
nation comprised of immigrants,
Garcia said the nation relies on
immigrant workers in service
jobs like agriculture as well as in
the high-tech worlds of science
and engineering.

Lynn Shotwell, executive
director of the American Council
on International Personnel and
a University Law School alum,
echoed Garcia's sentiments. She
said the future workforce needs
access to all the talent available,
which may come from people
who were born outside the U.S.
According to Shotwell, more
than 50 percent of graduates at
the masters and doctoral levels
are from foreign nations. How-
ever, because green cards are lim-.
ited, she said it is vital to promise
green cards to people who are


report.
Staff at the University of Michi-
gan Health System - a finan-
cially independent institution
- received a 3.3-percent salary
increase in 2010-2011, accord-
ing to the press release. The year
before, they didn't receive a base
salary increase.
"These staff have helped us
maintain stable financial health
despite a highly challenging
health care environment over the
past two years," Strong wrote in
the press release.
Erik Lundberg, the University's
chief investment officer, formerly
earned the second-highest base
salary but lost the position this
year after a 0.7-percent decline in
his base salary. He is currently the
fourth-highest paid at the Univer-
sity with a salary of $575,000. Last
year Lundberg had the largest sal-
ary increase at 18 percent, accord-
ing to the Daily article.
Royster Harper, the Univer-
sity's vice president for student
affairs, is the executive officer
with the highest salary increase
for 2010-2011 with a 16.2-percent
raise -2.8 percent of this increase
is based on merit. The difference
represents a salary adjustment,
accordingto the salaryreport. Her
base salary is currently $293,822.
With $577,360, Athletic.Direc-
tor David Brandon has the third-
highest base salary, earning a
52-percent increase over what his
predecessor Bill Martin earned.
After accepting her 3-percent
raise this fall, University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman now
receivesabasesalaryof $570,105-
not including other bonuses and

compensations. Coleman's salary
is the fifth highest of University
employees, according to the sal-
ary report.
Coleman's total compensa-
tion last year was $783,850. Like
the University's deans and other
executive officers, Coleman
abstained from receiving a merit-
based increase for the 2009-2010
academic year. Coleman's salary
increased by 4 percent, or about
$21,000, in 2008-2009, according
to a Nov. 17, 2008 Michigan Daily
article.
The Chronicle of Higher Edu-
cation listed Coleman as the
sixth-highest paid public univer-
sity president in 2009.
University Provost Philip Han-
Ion wrote in the press release
that he thinks this year's staff
and faculty salary increases are
necessary incentives to keep
"high-performing" faculty at the
University.
"It is important that we work
hard to retain our high-perform-
ing and internationally competi-
tive faculty and staff members,"
Hanlon wrote in the press release.
Hanlon added that budget-
ary decisions are made with the
University's relationship with
the state and Southeast Michigan
area in mind.
"The budget choices we make
are tied to important princi-
ples, including maintaining and
enhancing our ability to contrib-
ute to the state and the region,"
Hanlon said. '"We continue to
make reasonable investments in
our extraordinary faculty and
staff so we can fulfill this respon-
sibility."

graduating in order to guarantee
a solid workforce.
If changes aren't put into
place, Shotwell said America will
be forced to further outsource
domestic work.
"If the United States doesn't
adapt to immigration polices that
facilitate international business
that allow global companies to
move people around the world
expeditiously, then companies
are going to be forced to find
other ways to get that business
done - whether that means open-
ing facilities abroad or moving
workers abroad," Shotwell said.
Silvia Pedraza, a University
professor of sociology and Ameri-
can culture, said the DREAM
Act would reduce the need for
people to come to America ille-
gally, which is vital for progress
on immigration reform.
Immigration allows the U.S.
to "benefit from the talent that
comes from the rest of the world,"
Pedraza said.
But LSA sophomore Brian
Koziara, vice chair of external
relations for the University's
chapter of College Republicans,
said the DREAM Act provides an
incentive for illegal immigration
by promising citizenship to the
children of illegal immigrants if
they fit the criteria.
"The purpose and intent of the
act is good ... (but) the way (the
DREAM Act) goes about it is fun-
damentally flawed,"Ktiziara said.
Koziara added that he's glad
the legislation didn't pass in
its current state, as he said he
thinks the federal government
needs to enforce and strengthen
the nation's current immigration
laws before implementing the
DREAM Act.
Sherrie Kossoudji, an associ-
ate professor in the University's
School of Social Work, said the
DREAM Act does have its ben-
efits, but also said the country's
immigration policy should be
changed generally because peo-
ple who live their whole lives in
the country can still be deported.
"Someone can grow up in the
United States, go all the way
through college in the United
States, only know the United
States as home, and be deported
because they were brought here

without papers as a baby," Kos-
soudji said.
Garcia said he believes oppo-
nents of immigration reform
often have hostile arguments
because the issue is often tied to
domestic concerns like competi-
tion for American jobs and ter-
rorism.
"When we think about terror-
ism, we think about people who
may be immigrants who are com-
ing from other parts of the world,
so immigration and terrorism
gets intertwined," he said.
Garcia said he would like to
see the United States reform its
immigration policy by allowing
people from other countries to
fill the allocation of nations that
don't have as many people apply-
ing to live in America. For exam-
ple, countries like Switzerland
have fewer immigrants to the
U.S. than the reserved capacity
allowed - leaving unused spots
that could be given to other immi-
grants.
Garcia acknowledged that
immigration reform is a tough
issue for politicians like President
Barack Obama, but criticized
the president for putting more
emphasis on enforcement, secu-
rity and workplace raids rather
than worker programs and other
similar initiatives.
"He's getting hit on both
sides," Garcia said. "It's a no-win
situation."
Immigrants applying to
become legal U.S. citizens may
wait 10 to 12 years after they file
their initial petition. Given this
wait time, Garcia said he would
like to see the United States
implement a naturalization pol-
icy for people who have become
established in America and are
paying taxes and supporting their
communities.
Garcia continued by saying
that this would be a more rational
approach to the matter because
even if illegal immigrants are
caught, the deportation pro-
cess isn't solving all the current
issues. In 2008, only 390,000
immigrants were deported out of
the 10 to 12 million who lived in
America, he said.

grants in the departments of inter-

The objective of the SPORE
grants, according to the NCI web-
site, is "to reduce cancer incidence
and mortality, and to improve sur-
vival and quality of life for cancer
patients."
The NCI website states that
funding can be applied toward
researching17 different organ sites,
including the brain, lungs, skin
and, in the case of the University's
department of otolaryngology, the
head and neck.
Toby Hecht, the associate direc-
tor of the NCI's Translational

between 35 and 40 medical depart-
ments across the country apply for
SPORE grants each year. Currently,
there are 67 active grants distrib-
uted to academic institutions across
23 states, according to the NCI's
website.
Hecht added that the selec-
tion process for grant applicants is
based on determining which insti-
tutions will perform the best scien-
tific work with the funding.
"We don't particularly try to bal-
ance the organ sites," Hecht said.
"We do it based on science - the
best science rules."
Once the funding for the Uni-
versity's gastroenterology SPORE
grants ceases in 2015, the Medical
School will have the opportunity to
apply for another if it wishes, Hecht
said.

Snyder sworn in as state's governor

48th governor
talks unity,
transformation in
inaugural address
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily News Editor
LANSING - Republican Gov.
Rick Snyder ushered in a new era
in Michigan's government today,
as he was sworn in as the state's
48th governor here on the Capitol
steps.
In his inaugural address, Sny-
der said Michigan has a "bright
future."
"This election was a point of
realization," Snyder said. "The
old ways don't work. It's time to
start a new era in the state's his-
tory."
Instead of mentioning specif-
ics, Snyder spoke grandiosely,
imploring Michiganders to stop
fighting among themselves and
instead work together.
"We need to put party and
geography aside and come
together as Michiganders to rein-
vent our state," Snyder said.
Snyder outlined his four key
objectives to reinvent Michi-
gan. He said the state needs to
increase innovation in the glob-
ally competitive market, create
new jobs, ensure a better future
for the youth and not leave its cit-
izens behind in the reinvention.
"Let ,today be the birth of a
new chapter in Michigan's histo-
ry," Snyder said. "Let today be the
birth of the era of innovation and
the reinvention of Michigan."
Snyder continued on to say
technology isn't the only neces-
sity for innovation. He said the
right mindset is needed, adding
that he purposefully set high
expectations for himself.
"It is time to solve problems
and create opportunities," Sny-
der said. "It is also time to be
bold.I've been cautioned by many
that expectations are already too
high. We shouldn't walk away
from high expectation. It's time
to deliver on high expectations."

can who has never held elected

vention of Michigan," Calley said.
In their remarks, Johnson
and Schuette each spoke with
a more partisan tone. Johnson
quoted former President Ronald
Reagan's first inaugural address,
while Schuette said the day
marked "Morning in Michigan"
- playing on Reagan's "Morning

ment from the 1984 presidential
campaign.
"The people want asafer Mich-
igan," Schuette said. "A safer
Michigan with less government,
less taxes, less spending, more
pay checks and more freedom."

Newman and Richner - who
will serve their third and second
terms respectively - were sworn
in by Kelly at the same time as
the Trustees of Michigan State
University and the Governors of
Wayne State University.
After being sworn in, Richner
shouted "Go Blue!" - earning a
hearty chuckle from the crowd.

Store owner
attributes closure
to competition and
changing industry
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily StaffReporter
Students may have to venture
farther from campus if they need
to repair their shoes or ice skates,
since a long-standing campus
shoe repair shop closed its doors
last week.
After 70 years of business at
607 E. William Street, College
Shoe Repair stopped operations
on Friday. Store owner Dorothy
Brown cited skate repair com-
petition and an increased use of
plastics in the shoe industry as
problems that prevented the store
from making enough profit to stay
in business.
Major shoe manufacturers are
producing more shoes with plastic
soles, which the store is not able.
to repair. Brown said this could
cause problems for the shoe repair
industry in the future.
"If the soles are plastic, you
can't repair them," Brown said.
The opening of the Ann Arbor
Ice Cube, a sports complex in the
city, also caused a significant loss
of profit for Brown's business due
to its skate sharpening services,
she said.
College Shoe Repair had sharp-
ened skates since its opening,
Brown said, and had a "kind of a
monopoly" on the service when
the business began selling and
repairing skates and other hockey
equipment in the 1980s.
Brown said the shoe store's

closing has been an unfortunate
event for her and her family.
"I'm very sad. My husband died
in July, and it's like a part of him
that we're getting rid of," Brown
said.
Shortly after her husband died,
Brown's co-owner of the build-
ing in which College Shoe Repair,
White Market and several apart-
ments reside proposed selling the
building. Brown said she couldn't
afford to buy out her associate's
stake of ownership.
The space vacated by College
Shoe Repair currently has three
potential buyers, but Brown said it
has not yet been sold.
When asked where her clients
would go for shoe repair in the
future, Brown said she had been
referring customers to Park Shoe
Repair located on North 4th Ave-
nue. According to Brown, Park
Shoe Repair is one of the few shoe
repair shops left in the downtown
Ann Arbor area.
"I imagine they'll be busy,"
Brown said.
Todd Roberts, co-owner of
Park Shoe Repair, said he 'was sad
to see College Shoe Repair close.
"It's a shame when a family
business goes under," he said.
Roberts also said he expects
to gain business from the store's
closing, though he added that the
increase in profit comes from an
unfortunate event.
Speculating on the future of
the shoe repair industry, Roberts
stressed the need for customers
to understand that shoe repair
promotes sustainability. The shoe
repair business could continue to
make a profit "if people are edu-
cated that shoe repair is an act of
recycling," he said.

abbing salaciousness of "All she throws herself in front of a
Eve" and the melancholy car, Anna Karenina-style, and

becomes a ragged cripple.
Theoretically, then, Aronofsky
has created the flawless master-
piece he set out to create. Yet for
all of its adherence to form and
feminine signifiers and dual-
ity, "Black Swan" doesn't seem to
mean anything important. Almost
every work, whether high or low,
has a message, and its success is
largely dependent on whether the
audience is receptive to it.
"Requiem for a Dream" worked
because we walked out the theater
vowing never to do drugs again.
"The Wrestler" worked because
we felt our hearts shudder every
time we watched the battered,
bruised Randy the Ram catapult
into another punch. But if the
only thing we can come up with
after a screening of "Black Swan"
is, "Man, Natalie Portman really
freaked me out," does this mean
that the film failed to achieve its
message? Or does it mean that it
never had a message to begin with?
In reality, watching "Black Swan"
is nothing more than an experi-
ence - a blistering, fevered, errat-
ic one; It has no lasting power, no
higher concept reigning over the
slow, winding fouettes and reflec-
tive surfaces.
The strangest thing of all is,
this epiphany carries little weight.
The experience of watching Nina's
formidable slide into mania is
equivalent to a long, slow intake of
breath, and all we yearn for is that
jittery aria of a climax. When it
finally comes - a cadenza of beat-
ing wings and pooled blood, where
gilded flesh merges with bone and
sinew - the moment nonetheless
burns fabulously. Even if "Black
Swan" really is all style and no
substance, the style is so bruis-
ingly embedded into the film that
whatever the substance lacks
hardly matters.

ing and safe.
Created by Christopher Lloyd
("Frasier") and Steven Levitan
("Just Shoot Me!"), "Modern
Family" tells the story of three
factions of an extended family in
Los Angeles through a "mocku-
mentary" format. There's Jay (Ed
O'Neill, "Married with Children"),
the old-school patriarch, who's
married to Gloria (Sofia Vergara,
"Madea Goes to Jail"), his beauti-
ful, exotic and much younger wife
from Colombia. Gloria's son, and
Jay's new stepson, is the inquisi-
tive young Manny (newcomer
Rico Rodriguez). Jay's daughter,
Claire (Julie Bowen, "Happy
Gilmore") has three kids of her
own with eccentric husband Phil
(Ty Burrell, "Damages"). Finally,
there's Jay's son Mitchell (Jesse
Tyler Ferguson, "The Class") and
his partner Cameron (Eric Stones-
treet, "CSI"), who have adopted a
Vietnamese baby, Lily.
This dynamic made for hilari-
ous storylines during its first
year on the air. Claire's jealousy
of her very young stepmom, Jay's
rough adjustment to what he often
referred toas "Little Colombia" in
his house, Phil's absurd approach
to parenting and the way Mitch-
ell and Cam struggled to raise a

child. But a show must rise above
its original premise in order to
stay afloat and maintain original-
ity.
Unfortunately, the most recent
episodes have fallen victim to for-
mulaic plot points and preachy,
overly sentimental concluding
speeches, which overshadow the
quality elements that are still
there. So let this serve more as a
warning to the writers than any-
thing else.
The second season started off
strong. The premiere, "The Old
Wagon," dealt with themes of
change and getting older through
the metaphor of an old family
station wagon that Phil refused
to sell. While the three different
families didn't intersect as much
as they had in the previous season,
it was nevertheless an important
reminder of the dysfunctional
yet close familial bond that first
appealed to viewers and critics
alike. "Strangers on a Treadmill"
- a nice little nod to the classic
Hitchcock film - had Claire and
Mitchell conspiring together to
tell each other's spouses the faults
that bother them. This is the kind
of screwball comedy the show
should stick with.
But somewhere around the
Halloween episode it became
clear that this season lacked
imagination. In an effort to get
everyone in the family to play
along with her plan for a haunted
mansion, Claire bemoans the fact
that Halloween is the one holiday
that belongs to her, laying a guilt
trip on the other family members
in the process. Fast-forward to
the most recent episode, "Dance
Dance Revelation," and we can
see an eerily similar storyline.
Once again Claire complains, this
time only to Gloria, that planning
her children's school dance is the

"one thing" that belongs to her.
Coupled with other overly tout-
ed plotlines and repetitive charac-
ter quirks, "Modern Family" is ina
slump halfway through its second
season. Despite powerful acting
from the main cast, aswell as excel-
lent guest performances (Nathan
Lane as Pepper, Mitchell and Cam-
eron's larger-than-life friend; Celia
Weston as Cameron's overly touchy
mother and Danny Trejo as the
janitor atthe school dance, to name
a few) the show's foundation is in
danger of crumbling.
Luckily, Sofia
Vergara is still
really hot.
One might ask how the creative
forces can fix this. For starters,
they could do a bit more showing.
The grand monologues about life
and what it means to be a fam-
ily with which the episodes still
sometimes conclude are out of
place and only hinder the show's
progression. One only needs to
look to other examples of the
"mockumentary" genre (like
NBC's "Parks and Recreation"
and "The Office") to see that this
formula works best when used
to enhance the storylines, not
to bash the viewer over the head
with sentiment.
These are merely suggestions
for a show that has already proven
its worth. It's hard to predict how
the remainder of the season will
pan out. Fans can only keep their
fingers crossed that the train will
get back on the tracks and that
"Modern Family" will rediscover
the spark it once had.

Her dogged, fiery resolve runs
through all of "True Grit," giving
the film a continuous, headlong

The filmbegins in an accurate, if

Ghostface Killah, in his latest
record, emerges from the muddled
debris of a previous R&B-tinged
attempt to put it
on the line once
more. On Apollo
Kids, the 40-year- ApolloIKids
old calls upon Iu
fellow Wu-Tang Ghostface
members, friends Killah
and even family to Def Jam
contribute. In the
process, he hap-
pens to produce a genuine hip-hop
success. All of the components for
failure are present: He should be too
old for rap and his last album was a
departure from his usual style. Still,
Apollo Kids manages, above it all, to
be sincerely entertaining.
The lyrics are intelligent (most
of the time) and the beats are
unique. But what makes Apollo Kids
a triumph is Ghostface's ability to
blend grit and finesse. He's 40, but
he knows it, and this knowledge is
reflected in the music. In "Drama,"
Ghostface raps, "It's not a code of
La Cosa Nostra to roast ya / I get a
little closer." Instead of the juvenile
gang violence referenced by most
modern rappers, he's graduated to
the maturity of the mafia - a theme
that is echoed in other tracks
("Black Tequila"). Likewise, the
music has grown up - he doesn't
just rely on a beat and tired, ste-
reotyped rhymes, but he manages
to create varied and nuanced verse.
"2getha Baby" is instantly
noticeable among the other tracks
on Apollo Kids. Though the lyrics

are rather ordinary, the song inte-
grates them in a way that makes it
unique. It begins with a sample of
"Together" by '60s soul band The
Intruders, which repeats through-
out the song and brings to mind the
era of theTemptations. It is a fusion
of old and new, of romantic love
and superficial pursuit. Beyond its
contrast, it is one of the most blunt-
ly enjoyable tracks on the album.
Occasionally, Ghostface Killah is
upstaged by one of the many guests
he brings in - though this actually
benefits the album. In the Latin-
themed "Black Tequila," Ghostface
combines culinary allusions with
self-aggrandizing claims ("I'm
half black, half oregano / That's
half Italian, who he I'm from that
island"), but it's protege Trife Die-
sel who steals the song. As the third
Gangsta rapping
is not just for
the young.
and last rapper on the track, he tells
the typical rise and fall of a pro-
claimed "gangsta disciple." Trife's
segment is brief but effective, and
is eventually more memorable than
Ghostface's contribution.
"Purified Thoughts" is easily the
album's pinnacle. Though it may not
be obvious initially, listening to the
rest of Apollo Kids provides a cer-
tain context that makes the song all
the more deep and meaningful. It's
intense, rugged and strangely con-

templative. The song draws upon
Them Two's soulful "Am I A Good
Man," as Wu-Tang Clan members
Ghostface Killah, GZA and Killah
Priest discuss, among other things,
God, death, heaven and success. It
is unsettling in all the right places
- after Ghostface Killah's verse,
the sample asks, "Am I a good man?
Am I a fool?" to which Killah Priest '
replies, "Don't know" and "We'll
see," respectively.
The song feels like a hip-hop
judgment day as each contributor
shares his finalthoughts. Ghostface
Killah fantasizes about his influ-
ence on his death day, as he is left
"wishin' they could bury me next
to the prophets." Killah Priest navi-
gates his vision of the afterlife with
skillful and precise diction, going
through "hell's cavity" to "where
the jackals be." GZA finally leaves
us off with a heavy appraisal of life
and moral compromise: "Where
the youths kept comin' back with
they life earnings / Ready to make
a deal, soul and pipe burning." Each
line is deep in meaning and it goes
to show that Ghostface Killah is
still a force to be reckoned with.

Amid coaching rumors, Gator Bowl loss full of
'M' demolished in bowl familiar struggles

By RYAN KARTJE
Daily Sports Editor
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - With
months of practice to prepare for
the Wolverines' season opener
against Connecticut, Michigan
took the field in September and
proudly debuted one of the nation's
most explosive offenses in a 30-7
blowout win.
And with the same amount of
time to get healthy and 15 valuable
practices at their disposal before
their Gator Bowl matchup, the
Wolverines said last week that they
expected the same fresh explosion
that vaulted them to a 5-0 start, the
best in coach Rich Rodriguez's ten-
ure in Ann Arbor.
"If we look at the UConn game
when we first came out, we had
four weeks to prepare for that
game, and we had great execution
as a defense for that game," red-
shirt junior defensive end Ryan Van

Bergen said earlier thisweek. "It's a
similar situation here. We have the
exact same amount of time to pre-
pare for another big game."
But after Mississippi State ran
Michigan out of EverBank Field,
handing the Wolverines their
worst loss in 40 bowl tries, 52-14,
Michigan left the field exposed,
plagued by the same execution
problems that followed them after
their quick start to the season.
With them walked their embattled
coach, who, after months of specu-
lation and drama, may have paced
his last sideline as the Wolverines'
head football coach.
"Well, if I had the golden answer
to why sometimes 18-, 19-, 20-year-
old kids don't always execute
perfectly, well, it just happens
sometimes," Michigan coach Rich
Rodriguez said at a press confer-
ence after Saturday's game. "Some-
times you press a little bit, and I
think that probably may have hap-

pened a little bit today ... I don't
know, but it happens sometimes ...
They played well, we didn't. End of
story."
But Saturday's loss isn't the end
of the story for Rodriguez, who met
with Athletic Director David Bran-
don on Tuesdayto evaluate his team
and discuss his future. And after
a three-season record of 15-22, a
lone bowl appearance and the pro-
gram's firstmajor NCAA violations,
many have reported Brandon will
cut ties with the coach - though
a decision hasn't been announced
yet. On Saturday, Rodriguez's con-
tract buyout dropped from $4 mil-
lion to $2.5 million.
"RichRod is gone," ESPN ana-
lyst Adam Schefter tweeted after
Saturday's game. "And it's up to
the NFL to prevent Jim Harbaugh
from going there."

both of which havebeen associated
with the Wolverines during the
past three seasons.
Mississippi State put up 485

being a prolific passer, threw for
three touchdowns. The Bulldogs
converted more than half of their

they missed, it usually didn't mat-

never really liked the guy.

said about Rich Rodriguez. He was

But we were skeptical. And we
were scared. We were looking at
the end of Michigan football as
we knew it. Lloyd Carr, the last in
the Schembechler coaching line,
was retiring. And Les Miles, his

heir apparent, said thanks but no
thanks. To Michigan! What was
the world coming to? After 40
years of championships with three
yards and a cloud of dust, we were
going to run an offense that looked
more like three plays and a touch-
down.
There was a good number of
fans who were excited for the
change and wanted to see what
he could do. They were there, but
I guess they just weren't quite as

'M' secures 14th
GLI title with
offensive surges

Coaching gossip Brandon's
indecision hurting Blue

Captain Glendening
named Tournament
MVP after three-
point tourney
By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
DETROIT - While the stage
for the Great Lakes Invitational
wasn't quite as grandiose as the
outdoor hockey game at Michi-
gan Stadium earlier this month, it
was still Joe Louis Arena - home
of the legendary Detroit Red
Wings.
And
in just its COLORADO COLL. 5
second MICHIGAN 6
game
after
playing MICHIGAN TECH 2
in the MICHIGAN 4
record-
setting Big Chill at the Big House,
the No. 7 Michigan hockey team
showed its flare for the dramatic
once again on Dec. 30.
Michigan finally secured its
14th MacInnes trophy with a 6-5
win over No. 20 Colorado College
in the Great Lakes Invitational
championship game after relin-
quishing the lead three times.
While the Dec.29 4-2 semifinal
victory over Michigan Tech fea-
tured a stagnant first two periods
before a combined four goals in
four minutes in the third period,
the title bout was a different kind
of chaotic.
Senior forward Ben Winnett
got the Wolverines (12-5-4) off to
a hot start, scoring his third goal
of the season just 39 seconds into
the first period. Winnett banged
home a rebound after a scrum in
front of the Colorado College net
for the early 1-0 lead.
When junior forward Luke
Glendening scored a shorthanded
goal - his fourth goal of the sea-
son - 10 minutes into the first
period to put Michigan up 2-0,
the majority of the fans at Joe
Louis Arena erupted, as the GLI
was virtually a home game for the
Wolverines.
"You can't plan things like
(Winnett's goal)," Michigan
coach Red Berenson said. "That
was an important goal. And the
next goal, the shorthanded goal,
that was another important goal.
You've got the lead, you've got
some confidence, and you're hav-
ing at least a good start Our team
is a team that really thrives on
good starts."
But unfortunately for Michi-
gan, it was the Tigers who got
started next.
Michigan's penalty kill let up

its first goal of the night just 34
seconds after Glendening's score
in the first period.
Colorado College scored four
power play goals on the night.
Their first two man-advantage
goals came just over three min-
utes apart in the first, as the
Tigers (12-9-1) tied the game at
two heading into the first inter-
mission.
Associate head coach Mel
Pearson called the Wolverines
"resilient" after the game one
victory, and it was a characteris-
tic that Michigan had to embody
even moreso to come away with a
victory against Colorado College.
The Wolverines couldn't hold
on to a lead in the second period
and beginning of the third period.
Michigan goals by senior forward
Louie Caporusso and Glenden-
ing were quickly equalized by a
strong attack from the opposi-
tion.
The Tigers scored just over four
minutes into the third period to
tie the game at four. And this time,
Michigan didn't have a quick-fire
response ready.
The Wolverines gave up their
first lead of the game to Colorado
College less than six minutes into
the third period.
"That's where games are won
and lost - the end," Berenson
said. "But still, you can make a
big momentum shift by a good
start. Our team, I think they're
confident they can come back in
a game."
Taking on the resilient per-
sona, the Wolverines found the
puck-luck they needed late in the
third period.
Sophomore defenseman Lee
Moffie netted his first goal of the
season to tie the game up at five
with six minutes to play in the
third.
And as if it was on cue, sopho-
more forward A.J. Treais took
advantage of some good luck to
net his second game-winning
goal in two days to cement the
Wolverines' 14th GLI Champion-
ship.
"I lost the draw pretty clean,
really clean, actually," Treais
said. "I went into the corner,
took a peek over my shoulder and
threw it at the net and hoped that
it would go in. Lucky bounce, I
guess."
Treais's goal came less than
two minutes after Moffie's equal-
izer, but this time, the goal put
the Wolverines up for good.
"Our team battled hard,"
Berenson said. "We battled hard
at the start of the game to get the
lead (but) they came back.
"It was a great game. ... That
third period was really an excit-
ing period."

fter nearly a full day (or
week or month) of specu-
ation, reports, rumors,
anonymous sources, inklings, best
guesses and gut feelings, the hap-
penings of Rodriguez-Brandon-
Harbaugh-gate seemed to be
coming to a crescendo.
That escalation centered around
the parking lot of Schembechler
Hall on a blustery, bone-chillingly
cold Tuesday afternoon, where
media - some as early as 11 a.m.
- waited on
anything with
a pulse that
could tell them
whether Rich
Rodriguez was
no longer coach
ofthe Michigan
football team.
But for all RYAN
the sure bets KARTJE
and things
we know (or
say we know), there seems to be
only one painfully obvious thing
that I took from that parking lot:
We have absolutely no idea what
Athletic Director Dave Brandon is
thinking.
The natural thing, we all said,
would be to part ways with the
embattled, three-year coach
before the Wolverines' Gator Bowl
matchup. That way, the Athletic
Department could focus all of its
efforts on a coaching search - one
that didn't feel rushed and didn't
result in the school's third, des-
perate choice.
When that didn't happen, it
all suddenly made sense again.
Brandon must have wanted Stan-
ford coach Jim Harbaugh. It was
a match made in heaven for any
Michigan fan: an athletic direc-
tor hoping to settle the debacle
of unsuccessful, unpopular'head
coach and a former "Michigan
Man" quarterback who coached
a bad team into a national power.
The pairing had Michigan fans
salivating, and for a while, it
looked like it was going to happen.
Then, Harbaugh wasn't an
option and Rodriguez was still
there. Two hours later, Rodriguez
was fired and there was no Plan B.
Shortly after, Rodriguez was back
and maybe Harbaugh too. And so
on, and so forth.
By now, I'm sure, Lou Holtz has
been rumored to be the next coach
of the Wolverines, while Greg Rob-
inson is rumored to get a pay raise
- who knows. I stopped following
Twitter updates on this hours ago.
The point is, no matter what the
media may have reported so far on
this, it's not 100 percent either way
right now. And it probably won't be
until sometime on Wednesday.
That kind of time and specula-
tion, whether spent sitting in the
parking lot of Schembecher Hall
or googling and re-googling Rich

Michigan Athletic Director Dave Brandon will makea decision in the coming days regarding Rich Rodriguez's future.

Rodriguez's name to check on his
job status, is damaging to a college
football program, and it's espe-
cially damaging to the fans' public
opinion of said program.
Remember, Michigan fans have
gone through this once before -
when Rodriguez was hired and
Les Miles wasn't - and all that
did was turn the Wolverines into
a laughingstock. Three years and
22 losses later, Michigan will not
be able to brave that kind of public
humiliation in the same fashion.
Whatever Brandon's solution is, it
better work.
But no one knows what that
solution will be. Will Brandon cut
ties with Rodriguez? Probably. But
again, that's not much more than
a gut feeling and a host of specula-
tion.
After all the gossip and the
waiting and the awkward ques-
tions, bringing Rodriguez back
would be a shameful admission of
failure. We couldn't get that Har-
baugh guy, soI guess you'll do.
Sure, he could've put his
embattled coach out of his misery
after the Ohio State game. But the
further speculation and multiple
media sources citing his dismissal .
leave Rodriguez in an awfully
awkward position if he were to
return to the helm of the program.
This has the peculiar feel of an
on-and-off high school relation-

ship. And if any of us have learned
anything from a handful of those,
it's that they're never the same
after the first time you break up.
So if that does indeed happen
as planned, if Rodriguez is on the
first train out of town tomorrow
night following the team's 4 p.m.
meeting, then that leaves Brandon
with an overqualified candidate
who will probably forgo the Wol-
verines for the NFL and ... Brady
Hoke, San Diego State's head
coach.
That's an obviously disappoint-
ing position to be in today, after
sources earlier this week might as
well have spotted Harbaugh wear-
ing a Denard Robinson jersey and
singing Hail to the Victors on his
front porch.
But the truth here is that Michi-
gan fans may have out-Michigan-
ed themselves this time. And
the media may have proven that
speculation is a drugbest used in
moderation. Maybe Jim Harbaugh
was never going to coach the
Wolverines. Maybe Brandon has
a legitimate backup plan. Maybe
Urban Meyer is back out of retire-
ment and on his way to Ann Arbor.
I'm sure you could find an anony-
mous source for all three of those
claims.
or maybe Michigan just isn't
as great of a job as it used to be.
Maybe a lateral move from Stan-

ford to Michigan doesn't make
sense for Harbaugh and his fam-
ily. And maybe, just maybe, the
Wolverines aren't above hiring
coaches from smaller FBS schools
like San Diego State - after all,
Bo Schembechler was a coach at
Miami (Ohio) before he carne to
Ann Arbor.
Now, because of this Michi-
gan centrism, the long decision-
making process and the gossiping
Twittersphere, any candidate not
named Harbaugh is going to have
a tough time garnering support in
Ann Arbor. That is, until he wins.
Either way, the speculation
needs to stop Wednesday. Bran-
don needs to announce a decision
- one that's taken much too long
already - and the Wolverines need
a coach within a week, whether
it's Harbaugh, Hoke, Miles or my
roommate Dillon. Because every
day that Michigan's coaching
troubles remain the talk of college
football is another day we all look
stupid.
Whatever happens, Black
Wednesday is upon us. And I cau-
tion you, follow Twitter at your
own risk.

GATOR BOWL
From Page 1B
Wolverines, since a change to Har-
baugh or any other coach would
probably mean a change from the
zone-read spread offense that
Rodriguez brought to Ann Arbor.
Asked after the game whether
he would play for Michigan next
year if Rodriguez doesn't return as
the program's coach, sophomore
quarterback Denard Robinson
said, "No response."
"That's my coach. That's who
recruited me, so that's it."
It was Robinson who gave the
Wolverines a chance in the game's
opening minutes, pioneering an
impressive 10-play, 78-yard drive
to open the scoring in Jacksonville.
Then, after a 3-and-out and a sti-
fling blocked punt, Robinson again
marched his offense down the

field, lobbing a perfect touch pass
to a healthy Martavious Odoms
in the corner of the endzone. The
touchdown gave Michigan a 14-10
lead at the end of the first quar-
ter, as Robinson remained perfect
through the air - 7-of-7 for 98
yards and two touchdowns - and
electrifying on the ground - aver-
aging12.8 yards per carry.
But the next three quarters,
which yielded 42 unanswered
Bulldog points, ended the Wolver-
ines' season on a sour and frustrat-
ing note.
"I guess we didn't take our level
of preparation seriously," sopho-
more defensive end Craig Roh said.
Not known for his passing
prowess, Mississippi State quar-
terback Chris Relf torched Michi-
gan's young, struggling secondary
for 281 yards and three touch-
downs on 18-of-23 passing. His

dominance in the passing game
and threat to convert first downs
with his legs had the Wolverine
defense reeling, as the Bulldogs' 52
points were the most they scored
in a game all season and the sec-
ond-most Michigan has allowed.
With so much time to prepare
for the New Year's Daybowl game,
redshirt freshman lineman Tay-
lor Lewan agreed the loss was "an
embarrassment."
"7-5 was a great turnaround,"
Lewan said. "We were in a Janu-
ary 1st bowl game. And yeah,
it was embarrassing ... but this
team's going to come together and
we'll be just fine."
Added Roh: "It's not the end
of anything. It's the beginning of
something new."
For the program, however, this
loss could certainly mean an end -
the end of the Rich Rodriguez era.

our trust, our confidence in his
system. He had to earn that by
winning, of course. But even
before he got to Ann Arbor, before
he even had a chance to win, it
seemed to us like he'd already lost.
From there, starting without
the support of a sizeable portion
of the fan base, winning consis-
tently was difficult at best.
And he didn't win. Three wins
in the first year? Are you kidding?
Michigan became the laughing-
stock of the Big Ten and the coun-
try. Mighty Michigan, reduced to
a shell of what it once was. And
he just kept losing. Even when he
won, we remained skeptical. Sure,
he beat rival Notre Dame twice,
but they were struggling, too; in
shootouts, we worried about the
defense and whether the spread
could work consistently in the Big
Ten.
"He just isn't a Michigan man."
Rodriguez would have to earn
that title - but could he, really?
Because doesn't that title imply
more than just success on the
football field? We like to think it
does, because if it doesn't we're
exactly how we believe almost
every other fan base is - winning
is everything.
For us, it's supposed to be about
more. If he had won eight games
his first year and Michigan had
played in the Rose Bowl instead
of the Gator Bowl on Saturday,
would Rich Rodriguez be a
Michigan man? If so, doesn't the
term "Michigan Man" mean "A
Man Who Wins?" And if not, was
Rodriguez ever going to be able to
become a Michigan Man?
During this past season, in the
midst of our excitement about the
high-scoring offense and Denard
Robinson, we knew. We knew
the defense was still suspect. We
knew Robinson wouldn't stay
healthy. We watched the wins,
but did we ever really believe
them? It's hard to say. Some of us
AUERBACH

Will Hagerup handled kickoffs.
Michigan stopped attempting field
goals after Brendan Gibbons missed
amissed a 35-yarder early in the sec-
ond half. That meant the Wolverines
had to keep going for it on fourth
down, which didn't work, because
as Rodriguez put it, "When you can't
kick field goals, it hampers you a
little bit."
Then, throw in the media circus
surrounding the man. Pick a topic:
Rodriguez's job security, whether
he's a "Michigan Man" (whatever
that means), his rumored potential
replacement, Jim Harbaugh, the
NCAA violations or his buyout from
West Virginia.
It's a cloud of scrutiny that con-
stantly hangs over the guy. Even
in Jacksonville, where it was 72
degrees and sunny, that dark cloud
loomed over Saturday's game.
At the postgame press confer-
ence, when Rodriguez addressed
questions about his job performance
and the past three years, he slipped
into past tense. It wasn't necessarily
defeatist, but it was interesting.
"(My coaching staff and I are)
paid to do a job, and we did it as hard

DEFEND RODRIGUEZ
From Page 1B
outside the team's locker room
answering questions about what
might have been his last game as
coach of the Wolverines. He talked
about the lack of offensive execu-
tion after the first quarter and the
defense's inability to stop the Bull-
dogs on third down. But there was
one proud moment for the coach -
he said his players' approach didn't
change even with the cloud hang-
ing over the program.
"They knew the speculation and
all that," Rodriguez said. "But we
wouldn't let our guys talk about it,
think about it. So I don't think that
was an issue."
It wasn't until the night before
the game that Rodriguez finally
addressed the elephant in the
room in a team meeting.
"Everyone's thinking about it,"
junior nose tackle Mike Martin
said. "He just addressed it say-
ing, 'I know you guys are think-
ing about it, but nothing was ever
said because our attitude never
changed or anything. We just kept
on playing and practicing well.' He
just basically said we don't know
and it's not in his control."
Rodriguez may not be in control

probably did. Most of us did not.
Watching Michigan's 52-14 loss in
the Gator Bowl, Rodriguez's only
bowl as coach of the Wolverines,
our suspicions appeared to be
confirmed.
If it is over for Rodriguez, per-
haps we have to question whether
he ever had a chance. He wasn't
from the Midwest. He didn't run
an offense we were comfortable
with. He wasn't a Schembechler
protege. All reasons for skepti-
cism and doubt. ButI wonder if
he'd come in with the trust and
confidence of nearly all the fans
like his potential successor might,
would he have had that fighting
chance?
In the end, if Rodriguez is
fired, it will be for not winning
enough football games, plain
and simple. It won't be because
he's not a "Michigan Man," or
anything else. Let's take a look at
how Rodriguez's likely successor
is received. He, of course, will be
immediately named a "Michigan
Man" and enjoy all the support
and love from a united fan base in
a way Rodriguez never did.
Junior nose tackle Mike Martin
- a more ideal Michigan football
player would be hard to find; he's a
smart guy who plays through inju-
ries and eats up running backs and
goes hard every single play. He had
this to say after the game when he
was asked about what he thought
of people saying Rich Rodriguez
wasn't a "Michigan Man?"
"I think that's bull. Whatever
a Michigan Man is. Since I've
been here, I've been called a good
Michigan Man. He's been here as
long as I have and he's been there
for me and the rest of my team-
mates," Martin said. "The whole
staff and him, they're Michigan
Men. They're great men. (He is)
someone I'll look to in ten years.
I'll call him up and say, 'Hey
coach. Thanks for being there for
me.'"

and as well as we could with some
obstacles, butceverybody is going
to have obstacles," Rodriguez said.
"That's the one thing that, even
though the season certainly didn't
shape out the way we wanted it to
and there's a lot of things thatchap-
pened, we fought through it, and the
team got closer. This team is closer
today than it was a week ago and
three weeks ago, and sometimes
there's some hard lessons to learn
for all of us."
Rodriguez left the podium and
walked his brisk walkback to the
locker room. He exitedbthe stadium
after all his players. As I watched
Rodriguez walk away in maize and
blue apparel for potentially the final
time, I stood in thatchallway for a
moment, thinking.
What will those lessonsbe? And
what will we ultimatelycthink of the
Rich Rodriguez era?
Saturday's game could be the
start ofbthat discussion. I don'tknow
if "fitting" is the right word, but
it's strange that reaching this bowl
game was the pinnacle of Rodri-
guez's time at Michigan. The
outcome was the perfect repre-
sentation of it, too.

of his situation anymore, but soph-
omore quarterback Denard Rob-
inson was during the first quarter
against the Bulldogs - racing
around the right and left edges for
24-and-22-yard runs and throwing
for two touchdowns. But the Mis-
sissippi State defense adjusted and
after 150 first-quarter yards, Rob-
inson and the Michigan offense
was held scoreless.
After the game, Robinson's
quarterback coach Rod Smith
understood the situation that he
and the rest of the coaching staff
faced.
"Yeah, we're all worried about
that," Smith said of his job secu-
rity. "That'll be someone else's
decision. We're just going to keep
doing our jobs."
The sentiment among the play-
ers was that the coaches had done
their job in preparing the Wolver-
ines to play Mississippi State, that
this was a case of a lack of execu-
tion. And the family atmosphere
that Rodriguez tried to encourage
has his players coming to their
coaches' aid when nothing seems
certain about their future together.
Martin said he needed to talk
to his teammates first, but that he
could go with a group to meet with
Brandon to defend Rodriguez, if

basketball
team has on
its resume
so far this CHANTEL
season. JENNINGS
There
were just
five days between the two
games. No one gained weight,
grew a few inches or altered
their shot.
But the Wolverines that
played in those matches were
completely different.
The team that took the floor
against the Boilermakers looked
outmatched. Twenty of Purdue's
80 points came off Michigan's
14 turnovers. The Wolverines
looked frazzled facing Purdue's
suffocating man-to-man defense
and were unable to attack the
gaps that are created when a
team stretches its defense that
far.
Yes, Purdue beat Michigan
soundly. But the Wolverines had
a hand in it.
Against Penn State, the Wol-
verines came out and found
themselves down at halftime
once again. But this time, they
rallied, held it together and
closed out a game against an
experienced Nittany Lion crew
led by senior and preseason
all-everything nominee Talor
Battle.
So where was this squad less
than a week earlier? Maybe
Michigan wasn't better than
Purdue, but they definitely
weren't 23 points worse.
But that's what Michigan
coach John Beilein has been
struggling with all season - the
upswing of talent on his young
squad. He recruited kids that
can play the game, but that
doesn't mean sometimes their
hands or brains don't retreat
back to the speed they played at
in high school.
In the second half of Michi-
gan's game against Penn State,
with the Wolverines down four,
sophomore Darius Morris drove
the right side of the lane, draw-
ing three defenders and forcing
Tim Hardaway's player to sag
off him. Morris threw a beauti-
ful scoop pass while flying out
of bounds, and the crisp throw
went right through Hardaway
Jr.'s hands. He looked up in dis-
belief, down in frustration, then
turned and walked down the
court. All the while, his hands
were perched in front of his body

short holiday break - just two
days off - it doesn't mean that
they've completely adjusted to
the pace of Big Ten.
There will be glimpses of the
team's youth in every Big Ten
win. In every loss, it will probably
be a driving force. It's when those
errors pile on and the Wolverines
lose their calm and poise that
they begin to beat themselves,
like they did against Purdue.
In the late John Wooden's
autobiography, "They Call Me
Coach," Wooden wrote about
his 10 national championships
and some advice he gave to his
players.

"I constantly cautioned our
teams: 'Play your game, just play
your game. Eventually, if you
play your game, stick to your
style, class will tell in the end,'
" he wrote. "This does not mean
that we will always outscore our
opponent, but it does insure that
we will not beat ourselves.
"It always seemed to me that
more games are lost than are
won."
The Wolverines cannot allow
Michigan to beat Michigan.
There are 10 other teams in the
Big Ten that will do everything
they can to put Michigan away
- the Wolverines can't allow
another name to be added to the
list.
So, for the rest of the season,
the eight or nine names on the
statistics sheet will remain pret-
ty familiar. But the team's fate
will depend on which players
decide to show up.

it came to that point. And Martin
wasn't shy to speak for the rest of
the team, saying they all support
Rodriguez.
The Michigan community, in
Martin's opinion, hasn't given him
a chance since he left West Virgin-
ia for Ann Arbor in 2008.
"Since he walked in the door,
there was criticism just because
of he's switching to the spread,
and the defense is playing a three-
front, a 3-3-5," Martin said. "I
don't think since he got here there
was agreement with what he was
doing. Some of the losses didn't
help, didn't help his case. I totally
give it to those coaches. They're
great men. They're great coaches."
Redshirt junior defensive end
Ryan Van Bergen said earlier this
month that he had spoken to Bran-
don previously about the football
program but not about the coach-
ing staff. On Saturday, he said he
hasn't talked to the athletic direc-
tor in the past month.
"Obviously, there has to be some
adjustments made to improve our
team," Van Bergen said.
After all, the unit allowed 485
yards and 42 unanswered points
against Mississippi State.

on how to alleviate the suffering of
mankind. My aim was simple: I just
wanted to make a friend.
I was nervous when meeting my
first patient, a boisterous 82-year-old
woman with dementia, disorienta-
tion and an oxygen tube affixed to
her nose.
"I'm here to visit Gertrude," I
announced to nobody in particu-

"They're trying to get rid of me,

patient, Ruth, likes to tell me. Ruth
has a pretty severe form of demen-
tia, and on most visits she can't rec-
ognize me from the week before. But
we've gradually fallen into a routine:
I introduce myself. I compliment her

the salon every Thursday at 2 p.m.).
We talk about poetry.
There are days where I come in and
she is so full of pain that it hurts her

pull out my copy of William Word-

calm her down. But sometimes, she
can't even bear to listen.
Geriatrics presents a different sce-
nario than conventional medicine.
Usually, a person who comes to the
hospital is suffering from an "illness,"
which the doctor can deal with by fun-
nelingthese symptoms into a "disease"
and treating that disease with a "cure."
The heart of geriatric care is about
follow-up. Palliative care is fashioned
not in order to treat symptoms, but to
look at the big picture: morphine drips,
psychological and spiritual treat-
ment, pain management, anything
that makes their lives a little easier.
If a 20-year-old is sick, that illness is
treated as an abnormality, a battle tobe
vanquished. If an 8O-year-old displays
those same symptoms, the symptoms
are attributed to the natural processes
that gradually wear the body.
Past a certain age, doctors can't
stop the inevitable deterioration of a
human body - blood vessels harden,
arthritis sets in, bodily functions
decay. But a hospice can make the
transition more manageable.
Within the few short months I've
been a part of the hospice commu-
nity, I haven't figured out anything
about myself or what I'd do in the
event of an emergency, and I still
have no idea what the "suffering of
mankind" is. But I know one thing:
On the last day of training the hos-
pice volunteer coordinator told me,
"Your job as a volunteer is not just
to provide care and support for your
patient in their last months of life,
but to be a new friend."

James Duderstadt, a former
University president and current
University professor, also echoed
Hanlon's sentiments on the impor-
tance of professorial work.
Duderstadt arrived at the Univer-
sity 42 years ago, in the fall of 1968,
as an assistant professor of nucle-
ar engineering. He subsequently
served as the University's dean of
the College of Engineering from 1981
to 1986, provost from 1986 to 1988
and president from 1988 to 1996.
Duderstadt is currently a Uni-
versity professor with an appoint-
ed position in all the University's
schools and colleges, but he teaches
mainly in the School of Public Pol-
icy.
"When I was a dean or provost or
a president, most of my agenda and
calendar involved doing things that
everybody else thought were really

important - like trying to make the
University better, handling our rela-
tionships with Lansing and Wash-
ington, raising money of course,"
Duderstadt said. "When I'm a fac-
ulty member, I primarily work on
things that I think are important."
The history of the University and
shifts in the campus climate, partic-
ularly generational changes in stu-
dent activism is the most important,
Duderstadt said.
Though Duderstadt believes the
student body is talented academi-
cally, he misses the activist energy
that was present during his tenure.
Ann Arbor was the birthplace of the
Peace Corps, Students for a Demo-
cratic Society and the Black Action
Movement, during which students
protested the University's lack of
diversity.
"The Black Action Movement,
the teach-ins - although they hap-
pened shortly before I arrived here
- and students at Michigan were
very much playing a role as not only
the conscience of the University, but
in many ways the conscience of the
nation. You know, their fight against
the war in Vietnam, their fight
against racial injustices - and that
continued during my presidency."

Today, Duderstadt still keeps pho-
tographs from his presidential ten-
ure of students taking over his office
and "bearing their student rights"
by digging graves in the front lawn
of the President's House on South
University Avenue. Duderstadt
deems activism like that of the past
as a healthy part of campus life that
helped shape his curriculum.
In addition to the campus activ-
ism seen in his students, Duderstadt
emphasized the University's rich
history of academic excellence and
worldwide influence that has kept
him in Ann Arbor and helped him
decide to accept his first position as
assistant professor.
"I have become absolutely con-
vinced that this University from its
very founding has not only been one
of the most influential, but perhaps
the most influential university in
America," Duderstadt said. "It was
the first true university when it was
founded back in the early part of
the 19th century, and throughout its
history Michigan has always been a
pathfinder, an institution that tried
to do new things. Sometimes they
succeeded, sometimes they failed,
but when they succeeded, they
changed the world."

" More flexibility: with online and
lunch hour classes.
" More for your money: with one
of the lowest tuitions in the
greater Chicago area.
" More access:with 8 convenient
locations.

' I think it's incredibly valuable for academic leaders at the
University to really stay grounded in the core missions of
teaching and reSearCh at the Unive rSity - Provost Philip Hanlon

The Mayor
Hieftje's class, Opportunity for
Activism, which he designed six years
ago, outlines the operation of local
government by examining the efforts
of activists in Ann Arbor and the cur-
rent affairs of the city. According to
Hieftje, who emphasizes activism as
a definitive feature of campus life,
about one-third of the class sessions
have activists as guest lecturers.
"One of the things that I can bring
to it - it's not theory, it's real-time
activity in a real city and we get to
look at things as they're happening,"
Hieftje said.
Hieftje, an Ann Arbor native with
a long history of environmental activ-
ism, also provides students with
perspective on the shift in activism
in Ann Arbor since the draft days of
Vietnam and the Civil Rights Move-
ment of the 1960s.
"I think you see (students) volun-
teering to work in Detroit, I think
you'll see them volunteering to do
things in Ann Arbor ... I think they're
still very active," Hieftje said. "It's

a different kind of activism, it's sort
of an activism that says, 'I'm an indi-
vidual and what can I do to make a
change?"'
Opportunity for Activism focuses
on the potential for students and citi-
zens to shape local government and
become involved in Ann Arbor issues.
"I really feel that there's much
more opportunity for activism in local
government ... you can have a much
more direct effect than you're going
to find at a state level or a federal level
because you can go right and talk to
people who are making decisions,"
Hieftje said.
While the class focuses strongly on
issues pertinent to Ann Arbor, lessons
regarding local government apply
problems - like economic strains
- that other cities face. Such les-
sons help prepare students for future
careers in the government.
"You've got to be engaged in it,"
Hieftje said. "Be engaged with your
local government, your state govern-
ment, your national government. Be
aware. They're public policy students.
That's probably notgoingto be a prob-
lem in their lives, that's why they're
interested in it. We talk about ways

that you can petition and actually
have an effect on government."
Discussed in class are issues like
homelessness and affordable housing
in Ann Arbor, as well as the future of
sustainability in cities - topics stu-
dents find attractive because of their
national applicability.
"It's helped me to get more involved
in Ann Arbor," said Rackham student
Chad Cookinham, a Cleveland, Ohio
native.
"It's focused on what's actually
going on and what's happening in the
city. And I feel that because of that
I've gotten myself way more involved
in the city and what's going on here
and know way more about the place
that I live than I would have had I
taken just a kind of purely academic
class on whatlocal government means
in theory," Cookinham said.
While students enrolled in Oppor-
tunity for Activism can gain an appre-
ciation for the mayor's experience in
local government, Hieftje stresses
that he gets just as much from the
course, particularly in observing gen-
erational differences between current
students and older generations of citi-
zens.

By Rachel Brusstar
In an era when academic scheduling relies heavily on word-of-mouth reputation and the smiley face hierarchy of ratemyprofessors.com, students are
fortunate to have courses taught by tried and true Ann Arbor figureheads and some of the University's leaders and best, including the mayor of Ann
Arbor, a former University president and the current University provost.
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieft je, former University President James Duderstadt and Provost Philip Hanlon teach a range of graduate and undergraduate
courses at the University, providing students with an engaging perspective on pertinent campus issues.
During the fall semester, Hieftje taught Public Policy 456 Local Government, Opportunity for Activism in the School of Public Policy and Hanlon taught
Calculus I. Because of Duderstadt's position on a special congressionally-appointed committee on the future of the University, he did not teach during
the fall semester, but will teach two courses on national science policy in the School of Public Policy during winter semester.

The Provost

University Provost Philip Hanlon cited the potential of the stu-
dent body to change the world asone of the mosterewarding aspects
of his role asa professor and administrator.
Hanlon, a native of New York, completed his bachelor's degree
at Darmouth College, majoring in math and minoring in history. In
1981, he earned a doctoratefrom the California Institute of Technol-
ogy and taught applied mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology before returning to Cal Tech to pursue a fellowship.
In1986, Hanlon came to the University of Michiganto take a posi-
tion as an associate professor.
"I've been here 24 years, so it seems like home," Hanlon said.
Hanlonhas also maintained along-standingrelationship with the
U.S. National Security Agency, with which he works on cryptology,
the study of writing and solving codes.
"Some of my research is in very abstract mathematics - what's
called algebraic combinatorics. The more applied things that I've
worked on are computational genetics and some theoretical com-
puter science and ... quite a bit of work on randomizing lists, which

is equivalent to card shuffling," Hanlon said. "SoI know a lot about andaleft Riemann sum, students inthe class were receptive to Han-

About 214 of these students have life expe-

the wartime, they are reintroduced into the life of

Since the U.S. is currently involved in two

these vets have served overseas in combat zones.

to full-time student isn't easy.
A different experience
In the winter of 2007, Eric Fretz, a lieutenant
commander in the Navy Reserve and a Ph.D. can-
didate, was involuntarily recalled to serve a year-
longtour in Iraq.
"Seven days before Christmas, I was working
at my wife's medical clinic. Seven days before
Christmas," said Fretz who was in his 19th year in

the military and was planning to retire. "The guy
on the phone - he had this British accent, it was
the funniest thing - he said: 'This is Petty Offi-
cer so-and-so, from New Orleans. Are you sitting
down, sir?'
I said, 'Uh, I'm standing, Petty Officer, but go
ahead. Pass your traffic, what do you got?'
'Well, I've got orders for you, sir. You're being
involuntarily mobilized. We're sending you to
Iraq.'
I remember sitting down, looking out at that
snow fall ... and I said, 'When do I leave?'"
After that conversation, Fretz had 20 days
before he would spend at least one year in Iraq. "I
couldn't tell my wife for two days," Fretz remem-
bered.
During his tour in Iraq, Fretz served with the
Army's 18th Airborne Corps. He explained that
though he was in the Navy, he was assigned to
work with the Army because the Marine Corps
were so strained.
Fretz has made the transition from sailor to
student several times: he alternated from active
duty to reserves and obtained two bachelor's
degrees, a master's and a Ph.D. along the way.

"It's always a significant thing," said Fretz, who around here all the time. So you may still tend to
