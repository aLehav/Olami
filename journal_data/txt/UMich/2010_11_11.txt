Violations like
handling ice with
bare hands have
been corrected

By MICHELE NAROV
Daily StaffReporter
Each game day, in stainless steel
kitchens and concrete concession
stands, University health inspec-
tors work to protect Michigan
sports fans from potential food-
borne illnesses.
Stadiums across the country
rely on county-run inspectors to
investigate potential health code
violations, but the University has a
unique team of inspectors from the
Occupational Safety and Environ-
mental Health department. This is
a self-contained bureau within the
University that monitors health
practices at Michigan Stadium,
Crisler Arena, Yost Ice Arena and
all food venues on campus.
Before eachseasonstarts, OSEH
inspectors evaluate all permanent
stadium vendors. Each game day,
they inspect temporary food ven-
dors before the concessions begin
selling products to fans.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said temporary vendors

who fail inspections before games
aren't allowed to open their stands.
"There is a strong incentive to
do things right," he said. "Because
if they can't open on a game day,
they miss an entire day of revenue."
Inspectors also examine per-
manent stadium vendors during
games, monitoring employee prac-
tices and possible equipment mal-
functions.
According to health officials,
one of the advantages of separat-
ing University health inspections
from Washtenaw County inspec-
tions is that inspectors are able to
fix most violations immediately.
For example, when employees do
not wear hair restraints, they are
corrected on site.
Eastern Michigan University
uses county inspectors to check its
stadium, and according to Larry
Gates, director of EMU Dining
Services, the inspectors come a
few times a season.
Gates said even when dealing
with a smaller venue, he can relate
to the stress felt by the health
inspectors.
"The worry can cause you to
have a heart failure," he said.
"We've got 8,000 people, food
everywhere and 6,000 hot dogs
that need to be cooked at the exact
right temperature. It's a food ser-

By ANT MITCHELL
Daily StaffReporter
Students looking for a "black-
out in a can" may soon have to
take their search to Ohio.
The Michigan Liquor Control
Commission banned the alcoholic
energy drink Four Loko and other
alcoholic energy drink brands
earlier this week. Manufactur-
ers now have a month to get the
drinks off the shelves. Though
Four Loko has become a popu-

lar beverage choice on campuses
nationwide, it garnered much
negative attention after nine
Central Washington University
students were hospitalized last
month after consuming the drink.
Sharon Martin, the director
of Licensing for the Michigan
Liquor Control Commission, said
concerns over the beverage stem
from two major problems - its
misleading label and the oppos-
ing effects of mixing stimulant
and barbiturate, a depressant.
"I don't think (if) a law
enforcement person or a layman
... saw someone walking down the
street with one of these products,
they would know if it was one that
contained alcohol or one that did

not," Martin said.
Martin added that she
wouldn'tbe surprised to see more
states ban the drink in the future.
The state of Washington, where
the drink first garnered media
attention for its health risks, has
already followed suit banning the
drink.
"There are other states that I
see (which) are starting to step
forward and are looking at the
same course of action that Michi-
gan has," Martin said. "In fact, a
number of universities across the
nation have specifically banned
the alcohol energy drink from
their campuses."

Blood Drives United

Though many students
won't have the opportunity
to see the Ohio State Univer-
sity game on the gridiron in
Columbus during Thanksgiv-
ing break, Blood Drives Unit-
ed is offering an alternative
way to support the University
in its longstanding rivalry
against the Buckeyes.
Now in its 29th year, the
UM/OSU Blood Battle is col-
lecting blood for the Ameri-
can Red Cross and pitting
rival schools against one
another in the process. Blood
Drives United - along with
other campus organizations
including Alpha Phi Omega,
the Red Cross Club and Circle
K - is encouraging students
to show their school spirit
through friendly competi-
tion and help those in need of
healthy blood.

Last year and the year
prior, the Wolverines won the
battle, and LSA senior and
Blood Drives United chair
Mary Rock said she expects
this year to be no different.
"Blood Battle is off to a
great start," Rock said. "We've
had a lot of excited first-time
and returning donors, and
we're looking forward to see-
ing even more people come
donate in the next week and
a half."
With 20 more blood drives
left this month support-
ing Blood Battle, Rock said
her organization is trying to
incorporate all parts of cam-
pus into the competition. To
register to donate blood at a
variety of locations on cam-
pus including the Michigan
Union and Yost Ice Arena,
students can log on to www.

redcrossblood.org and enter
goblue into the sponsor code
field.
"Our numbers (of partici-
pants) have been increasing,"
Rock said. "We were able
to raise our goal this year to
2,500 pints."
In addition to focusing on
recruiting donors, Rock said
she and others in the orga-
nization want to make the
drives fun and safe for all
involved.
She added that it's impor-
tant for donors to eat prior
to giving blood, stay hydrat-
ed throughout the day and
expect to be in a donation
appointment for up to an hour
and a half.
"I know students are busy
but ... you could be saving
three lives," she said.

Q3 ahead of stock

Thousands of students march during a protest against plans to increase tuition fees and cut university funding. Violence broke out
against police during the march.
Thousands of students in
UK protest tuition hike

Violence erupts
amidst plans to
triple university fees
LONDON (AP) - Tens of thou-
sands of students marched through
London yesterday against plans to
triple university tuition fees, and
violence erupted as a minority bat-
tled police and trashed a building
containing the headquarters of the
governing Conservative Party.
Organizers said 50,000 stu-
dents, lecturers and supporters
demonstrated against plans to
raise the cost of studying at a uni-
versity to 9,000 pounds ($14,000) a
year - three times the current rate
- in the largest street protest yet
against the government's sweeping
austerity measures.
As the march passed a high-
rise building that houses Con-
servative headquarters, some
protesters smashed windows as
others lit a bonfire of placards out-
side the building.
Office workers were evacuated
as several dozen demonstrators
managed to get into the lobby,
scattering furniture, smashing
CCTV cameras, spraying graffiti
and chanting "Tories Out," while
outside police faced off against a

crowd that occasionally hurled
food, soda cans and placards.
"We are destroying the building
just like they are destroying our
chances of affording higher educa-
tion," said Corin Parkin, 20, a stu-
dent at London's City University.
The violence appeared to be car-
ried out by a small group as hun-
dreds of others stood and watched.
Anarchist symbols and the words
"Tory scum" were spray-painted
around the building, and black and
red flags flew from atop an office
block beside the 29-story Millbank
Tower.
Rooftop protesters threw down
water, paper - and in one case a
fire extinguisher, to boos from the
crowd below.
Police said eight people, a mix of
protesters and police officers, were
taken to hospitals with minor inju-
ries.
The Metropolitan Police said, "A
small minority of protesters have
taken it upon themselves to cause
damage to property, whilst the
vast majority have peacefully made
their point."
Nearby, the headquarters of
Britain's MI5 spy agency, Thames
House, was sealed with heavy
metal doors as police guarded the
rear exits. I
Organizers condemned the vio-

lence. Sally Hunt, general secretary
of faculty group the University and
College Union, said "the actions of
a minority, out of 50,000 people, is
regrettable."
Elsewhere, protesters were
peaceful but determined.
"I am here because it is impor-
tant that students stand up and
shout about what is going on," said
Anna Tennant-Siren, a student at
the University of Ulster in Coler-
aine.
"Politicians don't seem to care,"
she said. "They should be tak-
ing money from people who earn
seven-figure salaries, not from stu-
dents who don't have any money."
Frances O'Grady, of the Trades
Union Congress, said the hike
would make colleges "no-go zones
for young people from ordinary
backgrounds."
"This is about turning colleges
and universities from learning
institutions into finishing schools
for the rich," she said.
Britain's Liberal Democrats,
who are part of the coalition gov-
ernment with the Conservatives,
pledged during the country's elec-
tion campaign to abolish fees.
Protest leaders said they would
attempt to use recall powers to oust
lawmakers who break campaign
promises on the issue.

Detroit auto giant
reports third straight
profitable quarter
DETROIT (AP) - Strong prof-
its on new cars and trucks helped
General Motors Co. earn $2 billion
in the third quarter, enhancing the
company's appeal as it nears next
week's initial public stock offering.
The third-quarter earnings of
$1.20 per share nearly match what
GM made in the first two quarters
of the year combined, aided by
profits from overseas and healthy
revenue from North America, the
company said yesterday. The earn-
ings were boosted by higher prices
from newly introduced models
such as the Buick LaCrosse, a mid-
size luxury sedan.
"I think the results of the third
quarter clearly point to the amount
of progress that GM has made,"
GM CEO Dan Akerson said in a
conference call with analysts and
media. He said GM is on track to
make 2010 its first profitable year
since 2004.
The results were another indi-
cation of a widespread recovery,
among global automakers. Toyota,
Honda, Nissan, Chrysler and Ford
all reported improved results in
the most recent quarter as auto
sales slowly rise.
The strong quarter meant that
GM met projections it made a week
ago that net income for the quarter
would be $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion.
It was the third-straight profit-
able quarter for GM, which needed
$50 billion in U.S. government aid
to make it through bankruptcy
protection last year. The com-
pany has repaid or plans to repay
taxpayers $9.5 billion, and the
government hopes to get back the
remaining $40 billion with the
Nov.18 common stock offering and
several follow-up sales.
Also yesterday, a person briefed
on the matter said that Swiss bank
UBS is no longer working on the
IPO because one of its employees
leaked information about it in an
unauthorized e-mail. The per-
son didn't want to be identified
because the bank had not been
publicly named as the source of the
e-mail.

The latest results reversed
a $908 million loss, or 73 cents
per share, in the third quarter of
last year, a short quarter for GM
because it spent the first nine days
in bankruptcy protection.
The Detroit automaker posted
$34.1 billion in revenue for the
July-through-September quarter,
up 35 percent from the $25.1 bil-
lion in the shortened period last
year. GM had said last week that
revenue could reach $34 billion for
the quarter.
Revenue has been steadily
increasing this year, largely due to
gains in North America and explo-
sive sales growth in China. !
For the quarter, GM reported
strong profits in all of its regions
but Europe, where it lost $559 mil-
lion. The company reported $2.1
billion in profits from North Amer-
ica, and its international opera-
tions, including Asia and Latin
America, made $646 million.
GM said better pricing in North
America contributed $600 million
to its bottom line. The company has
cut back on costly incentives and is
earning more per vehicle on some
new products. In an Internet pre-
sentationforpotential investors last
week, GM said it's making $7,500
more per car for the 2011 Buick
LaCrosse compared to the previous
model. LaCrosse sales have more
than doubled so far this year.
The earnings per share figure
for the quarter was adjusted for a
three-for-one stock split approved
by GM's board last week in advance
of the initial public offering.
The third-quarter earnings
come in the middle of a two-week
"road show" in which GM execu-
tives are fanning out to U.S. and
European money centers to sell
investors on the upcoming IPO.
The positive third-quarter per-
formance should help them make
their case.
But investors likely will have
questions about the losses in Europe
and how GM will handle increasing
competition that's coming in the
U.S. for several key GM models. For
example, the new Chevrolet Cruze
compact now is the newest car in
its class in the U.S., butFord, Honda
and others soon will unveil strong
new products.
"We know we have much more

Loffering
work to do. We still need to fix
Europe. We continue to be vigilant
in reducing costs in the enterprise,
and we have just started doing a
better job in marketing our brands
to consumers," Akerson said.
GM warned that it expects a
lower pretax profit in the fourth
quarter as it ramps up spending
for the launches of the Cruze and
the Chevrolet Volt electric car. The
company made a pretax profit of
$2.3 billion in the third quarter.
The company also said it made
a second-quarter accounting mis-
take involving devalued Venezu-
elan currency, reducing cash by
$199 million. GM says doesn't con-
sider the error to be material. GM
has been plagued by accounting
errors and has listed lax financial
controls as a risk factor in its IPO.
Another problem that surfaced
in GM's earnings report: its global
market share fell to 11.5 percent
from 11.9 percent in the third quar-
ter of 2009. The company said its
share partly declined because it
saw fewer sales to rental, corporate
and government fleets. Fleet sales
accounted for a little more than a
quarter of the company's sales in
the latest period, compared with
34 percent of its sales in the second
quarter.
GM said it ended the quarter
with $35.8 billion in cash, up from
$33.6 billion in the previous quar-
ter, and $8.6 billion indebt, up from
$8.2 billion. GM said the increase
in debt was primarily due to unfa-
vorable fluctuations in currency,
including a stronger Canadian dol-
lar and a weaker British pound.
The company didn't answer
questions during a conference call
with analysts and the media, cit-
ing rules that limit communication
before public offerings.
In the stock sale, three of GM's
four owners - the U.S. govern-
ment, Canadian and Ontario
governments and a union health
care trust - will sell 365 million
shares, or about a quarter of the
company's outstanding common
stock, for between $26 and $29 a 4
share. The IPO will raise about
$10 billion for the three owners
and allow the largest, the U.S.
government, to reduce its stake
in the company from 61 percent to
just over 40 percent.

ALBION, Mich.
College takes action
after students burn
gay pride flag
Albion College says it has taken
"appropriate action" after con-
firming that students burned a gay
pride flag last month at the school.
School President Donna Ran-
dall says in a statement yesterday
that the private four-year liberal
arts college was contacted Oct.
19 by a student who claimed that
other students had burned the flag.
The Michigan school's Cam-
pus Safety department investi-
gated and identified the students
involved. Randall says investiga-
tors determined that the students
found the flag in a trash can and
decided to burn it.
Randall says "appropriate action
has been taken to address the con-
duct of the students involved," but
says privacy laws prohibited her
from providing additional details
about that action.
Randall says the school "con-
demns harassment."

Arizona authorities say they've

TEHRAN, Iran
Iran to test new
missile system
Iran is building its own
advanced anti-aircraft missile
system, after Russia wouldn't sell
it one, a top commander of Iran's
elite Revolutionary Guard said
yesterday.
Gen. Mohammad Hasan Man-
sourian said Iran will soon test its
own version of the S-300 missile
system, which is still heing devel-
oped at military industrial sites, the
official IRNA news agency report-
ed.
Mansourian's comments come
after Russia banned all sales of
S-300 missile systems to Iran, cit-
ing the latest round of tough U.N.
sanctions.

.Russia signed a 2007 contract to
sell the sophisticated systems that
would have dramatically boosted
Iran's ability to defend against air
strikes. Israel and the United States
objected to the deal.

investigates student
death at party
Georgia prosecutors said yes-
terday they are searching for
more suspects in the killing of an
18-year-old who was stomped to
death in an apparently random
attack at a house party over the
weekend, even as three of the four
men charged with the teen's mur-

Douglas County District Attor-
ney David McDade said witnesses
have indicated there may have
been others involved in the death of
Bobby Tillman, who was stomped,
kicked and punched to death early
Sunday at a house party while doz-
ens of bystanders watched.
"With so many young people
in the crowd you can imagine the
difficulty we are having in sorting
out the numerous varying versions
of what took place," McDade said.
"We are working on identifying
everyone involved if we can."
Tillman and about 80 others had
descended on a house party Satur-

ing-class suburb west of Atlanta,
that spilled out on the street when
the crowd grew unruly.

tour in the city of Qazvin about 90 miles west of the capital Tehran, Iran.
Iran declineitSI to di4scu-ss
litin nuclear program

Ahmadinejad says
country will discuss
more collaboration
with other nations
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - Iran's
president said yesterday that his
country wants to discuss coopera-
tion to resolve global issues and
to promote peace and security at
nuclear talks with world powers,
but won't talk about what it insists
is its right to continue nuclear
activities.
President Mahmoud Ahma-
dinejad spoke a day after Iran
offered to resume nuclear talks
this month with six nations -
the United States, Russia, China,
Britain, France and Germany.
The talks collapsed last year and
Ahmadinejad's comments raise
further questions about whether
Iran is willing to reopen the dia-
logue on its nuclear program.
In Washington, a senior U.S.
official said that the U.S. and
its allies are willing to discuss
a range of issues with Iran, but
chief among them is Tehran's
nuclear activities.
"Iran's nuclear program is on-
top of our list but we will come
to the meeting prepared for talks
on a range of subjects," the U.S.
official said. He spoke on condi-
tion of anonymity in order to dis-
cuss the sensitive issue.
The U.S. and its allies suspect
Iran's nuclear program is aimed
at producing weapons, though
Iran denies this and says it only
wants to generate power.
The president's remarks were
among the many conflicting and

ambiguous messages from Iran
over the years about its willingness
to enter into nuclear negotiations.
it has also sent counterproposals
and used delaying tactics that have
brought talks to an impasse.
Addressing a group of people in
Qazvin, in northern Iran, Ahma-
dinejad said Tehran is ready to
discuss "global challenges" and
help global peace based on mutual
respect but won't discuss its right
to continue nuclear activities.
"We've said repeatedly that the
Iranian nation will never discuss
its basic rights with anybody,"
Ahmadinejad said. "Iran is ready
for talks on equal conditions to
cooperate to resolve global issues,
ease international concerns and
help global peace and security."
Adding to the uncertainty of
Iran's offer, different officials
suggested different dates: Nov.
15 or 23 or Dec. 5. Iran wants the
talks to take place in Istanbul,
where it would have its Turkish
allies on the sidelines.
Iran says it has a non-negotia-
ble right under the Nuclear Non-
proliferation Treaty to enrich
uranium for producing nuclear
fuel.
The international community
has sought to persuade Iran to
give up enrichment because the
technology also offers a poten-
tial pathway to weapons devel-
opment.
"The Iranian nation will wel-
come any hand extended to it
with honesty but will cut the
hand if it is with deception and
conspiracy," Ahmadinejad said,
prompting chants of "Death to
the U.S." from the crowd.
Addressing the six nations, he
said, "If some of you have the men-

tality of selfishness and arrogance,
the response of the Iranian nation
will be the same it has given until
today and will disappoint you from
the continuation of your life."
"We are ready for talks under
these conditions," he added.
Iran has called on the U.S. and
its European allies to explain
in the talks their position on
Israel's nuclear program, which
is widely believed to include an
undeclared arsenal of weap-
ons. Iranian officials have also
sought to discuss what they see
as U.S. interference in the Mid-
dle East and the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan.
Ahmadinejad appeared to refer
to these demands again yesterday.
"We in the past said you must
declare your views about some
global issues," he said. "If you do,
we will discuss them with you on
that basis. If not, we will deter-
mine the answers for you and will
talk to you on the basis of your
past behavior."
Iran has ruled out any discus-
sion of a nuclear fuel exchange
deal that it balked at last year
and which was meant to ensure it
could not divert material to nucle-
ar weapons production.
That U.N.-drafted proposal
would have at least delayed
Iran's ability to potentially
go down the weapons path by
requiring it to ship nearly all of
its stockpile of enriched ura-
nium abroad to be returned as
reactor-ready fuel.
Iran refused, but later accept-
ed a similar fuel swap proposal
from allies Brazil and Turkey.
The six nations, however, said
that offer fell short of their
demands.

LSA-SG
From Page 1A
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the survey eventu-
ally led to a technical showdown
between the top two vendors -
Google and Microsoft - to pick
which one would be implemented
at the University.
"The survey that was offered
to students, faculty and staff was
meant to really help better under-
stand what tools people use and
how they use them, and then that
was narrowed down to (Google
and Microsoft), who were invited
to campus and made presenta-
tions," Fitzgerald said.
Beginning in late September,
Google and Microsoft held pre-
sentations at the University to
introduce the collaborative tools
that they said could improve the
quality of IT services for the cam-
pus, giving students, faculty and
staff the opportunity to better
understand the future of IT ser-
vices.
Fitzgerald said he's not sure
exactly when the University
would officially announce the
new IT collaborative system, but
he speculates that the decision
will come before the end of the
calendar year.
Steven Benson, LSA-SG Presi-
dent, said his organization first
looked into the University's adop-
tion of new collaborative tools
when Google and Microsoft held
their presentations on campus in
late September and the beginning
of October.
"Right when Microsoft and
Google were coming to campus
was when we started to take a
personal interest in this," Ben-
son said. "A lot of our members of
government were really person-
ally interested in seeingthe direc-
tion of (the University) in terms
of e-mail systems, calendars and
what system they would use."
Following the presentations,
LSA senior Jeff Wojcik, academ-
ic relations officer of LSA-SG,
stressed the potential of the col-
laborative tools to improve both
the academic and extracurricular
lives of students.
Initially, Wojcik, who spon-
sored the resolution, said he sent
an e-mail to all of the members of
the studentgovernmentto receive
feedback on whether they pre-
ferred Google or Microsoft for the
new University system.
"I encouraged people ... to go to
the presentations for both Micro-
soft and Google to learn about
the products, so that they could
be better educated when they
weighed in about which (collabo-

ration tools suite) they wanted to
push for," he said.
By urging other members of
LSA-SG to attend the presenta-
tion, the government was able to
gather an array ofviews regarding
differences in the presentations of
the two companies, Wojcik said.
Wojcik explained that before
determining whether LSA-SG
was going to formally endorse
one product suite or the other, the
group collectively decided that
it was necessary to research the
two options and allow a variety of
opinions within the government
to be expressed.
Despite the widespread use of
Google products within the LSA-
SG community, some members
voiced concerns regarding the
privacy policies of Google.
"There were concerns brought
up in our most recent meeting
about Google's ability to preserve
the privacy and security of stu-
dents and really faculty and staff
data at the University," Wojcik
said.
In response to the apprehen-
sion about the security of the
campus community, members of
the student government exten-
sively researched the security
policies of Google and talked with
University students about their
feelings of security when using
Google products.
The United States government
under the Federal Information
Security Management Act has
certified the security policies of
Google, Wojcik said.
After many members of LSA-
SG attended the presentations
by Google and Microsoft, Wojcik
said the consensus was that more
students were in favor of the
collaboration tools offered by
Google.
"I think both Microsoft and
Google's products are ... really
useful collaboration tool suites,
but ... Google was the best choice
for students," Wojcik said.
Benson echoed Wojcik's senti-
ments, adding that "there were
definitely some members of gov-
ernment, too, that supported
Microsoft, so we had a really
healthy discussion."
Wojcik said many student orga-
nizations across campus includ-
ing LSA-SG often use various
features offered by Google, like
Gmail, Gchat and Google Docs,
adding that LSA-SG's resolution
to endorse Google has been in the
works for the past few weeks fol-
lowing the presentations of the
companies.
"We thought it would be a good
ideato lobbyfor whatthe students
were interested in seeing in their
collaboration tools," he said.

Vivek Pande, Charles Maddox and
Ajay Goyal of Jindal Global Law
School.
According to Khanna, the long-
term goal of the partnership is to
gain a deeper understanding of
legal issues in a global society.
"(The aim is) to enhance under-
standing of law and legal issues in
India and obtain a deeper under-
standing of legal issues related to

development and the role of the
law in an increasingly heteroge-
neous society and world," Khanna
wrote in an e-mail interview.
The center will focus on
research and legal policy analy-
sis, while working to develop col-
laborative teaching and research,
officials said.
According to the press release
the centre will focus on studying
"the regulation of financial mar-
kets and corporate governance in
the United States, India, and other
jurisdictions."
"Michigan Law has a long and
proud tradition of global law, and
today, most areas of the law have
international aspects," Caminker
said in a press release. "We look
forward to working with O.P.
Jindal Global University to estab-
lish new initiatives and exchanges

of benefit to our students and fac-
ulty in this global context."
Khanna said in the same press
release that building relationships
with Indian institutions is vital to
the University because of India's
growing role in a global society.
"India is the world's largest
democracy, second most popu-
lous country, and one of the fast-
est growing economies," Khanna
wrote. "Studying legal issues
related to India and the US is
important and fascinating and
helps to better understand the
role of the law in a heterogeneous,
fluid, and increasingly global
environment."
As a first step in this partner-
ship, the Jindal Global Law School
has invited Khanna to serve as a
visiting professor this upcoming
semester.

The purple state.
Snyder must encourage bipartisanship in Lansing
fter eight years of being a blue state, Michigan residents
will have a Republican governor come January. Rick
Snyder - who won last week's election by sticking to a
platform based on moderation - is an interesting politician in an
era with rigid party lines. It appears that Snyder is delivering on
his promises. On Monday, he announced that he would appoint
current Speaker of the House Andy Dillon - a Democrat - as his
treasurer. By appointing a prominent Democrat to his cabinet,
Snyder has made an effort to instill an atmosphere of bipartisan-
ship in Lansing. Snyder must continue to display his moderate
stance and the legislature should follow his example.

s I think about the results of
lastweek's election, I've found
myself in a sort of haze trying
to piece together
where we stand as
a society. It's not
that I'm surprised
that the political
pendulum swung
to the right last
Tuesday, Anyone
who's picked up a
newspaper in the
past few months MATTHEW
could've seen that GAE E W
coming. But what's GREEN
troubling is that
this post-election
political atmosphere has left us with
fewer answers - and more confusion
- about our identity as a nation,
There's an African American in the
White House, but come January there
won't be a single person of color in the
U.S. Senate. Women will constitute
roughly the same proportion in Con-
gress as they do now - slightly fewer
than twenty percent. But with more
Republican women than before, the
already tenuous legislative support
for reproductive rights will probably
wane. And with the election of David
Cicilline (D-R.I) to the U.S. House of
Representatives, there will be more
openly gay congresspeople next Janu-
ary than ever before. Nevertheless,
our next Congress will be even less
likely than our current one to support
the rights of the LGBTQ community.
Contradictions have certainly been,
part of American politics ever since
our slaveholding forefathers tried to
ingrain freedom and equality as part
of our political discourse. But as we
enter into another chapter of democ-
racy, the contradictions before us are
particularly confounding.
And it's not just in terms of civil
rights. The New York Times reported
last week that while the wealthiest

1 percent of Americans controlled
9 percent of all income in 1976, that
same 1 percent controls 24 percent
of income today. Times columnist
Nicholas Kristof went on to say that,
"From 1980 to 2005, more than four-
fifths of the total increase in Ameri-
can incomes went to the richest I
percent." Yet, in spite of this back-
drop, our current lame-duck Congress
seems poised to extend the Bush-era
tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.
And a more conservative Congress
will probably continue to neglect this
extraordinary income inequality,
focusing instead on creating new tax
breaks for the upper crust.
it doesn't matter that the motives of
these politicians are perfectly plain to
see. The point is that as a nation, we're
constantly pulled right and left and
the divisions between us are wide and
confusing. It's increasingly difficult to
say who's right and what actions our
politicians ought to take. If there was
any question before the election, Pres-
ident Barack Obama now officially has
the hardest job in the country, as the
head of a democracy that can't figure
out who or what it is.
As I ponder today's 92nd anni-
versary of the end of World War I, I
have to wonder how far we've come
since that time. It was during that
era - another period of confusion
and gross contradiction - that Presi-
dent Woodrow Wilson enunciated
his dream "to make the world safe for
democracy." And ever since, Wilson's
words have hung like a self-awarded
medal on the breast of American for-
eign policy. But let's not forget that
when Wilson uttered those words,
no women and only some black men
could actually participate in the
democracy that the president had
hoped to bring to the world.
In the past century, we've fought
wars - which continue today - for
the stated purpose of defending free-

dom and popular rule. And for this
column at least, I'll give our govern-
ment the benefit of the doubt that
their campaign for democracy was
well intentioned. Yet, it seems rather
obvious by now that at least part of the
reason why we've failed at promot-
ing democracy abroad is that our own
democratic ethos at home is so ambig-
uous. We act on preferences rather
than principles. The result is a culture
of contradiction.
Recent elections
have left us once
again confused.
In the face of such inconsistency,
exemplified by this most recent elec-
tion, it would be easy to grow disil-
lusioned about politics or about our
ability to bring about social change.
Indeed, our politicians have largely
failed us. And even if you're happy
about this past election, you're proba-
bly not optimistic about political prog-
ress following anytime soon.
As students at the University,
we're presented with the inspiring
and daunting reality that in a couple
decades or sooner, we - or at least
our contemporaries - will replace the
current ineffectual generation of poli-
ticians. Rather than getting turned
off from politics, we need to pay more
attention than ever. It will be up to us
to answer the complex questions that
our parents' generation have created
or ignored. And as we form our opin-
ions and consider different careers,
more than ever, we have a responsibil-
ity to do just that.

According to a Nov. 9 article in the Daily,
governor-elect Rick Snyder announced two
appointments to his cabinet on Monday at
the Ford School of Public Policy. He appoint-
ed Dick Posthumus - the Republican who
served as lieutenant governor under for-
mer Gov. John Engler - as his senior advi-
sor and Andy Dillon as treasurer. Dillon
ran in the 2010 gubernatorial election as
a Democrat and was defeated by Lansing
Mayor Virg Benero in the primaries. bur-
ing the announcement of the appointments
on Monday, Snyder stressed that Posthumus
and Dillon were chosen on the basis of their
experience, not their party affiliation, say-
ing, "Let's stop fighting over the extremes
and recognize Michigan is ina crisis."
Botl Posthumus and Dillon have signifi-
cant experience in state politics. Posthumus
has already spent four years in the gover-
nor's office during Engler's term. He has
also served as the Michigan Senate major-,
ity leader and held the position longer than
anyone in the state's history. Dillon has
spent six years in the state House of Rep-
resentatives and has been speaker for the
last four. These individuals bring necessary
public service experience to the table that
Snyder should make full use of - especially
considering his lack thereof.
Snyder's appointment of a Democrat to

his cabinet is almost unheard of. It cer-
tainly hasn't been done in recent memory.
By appointing Dillon, Snyder demonstrat-
ed his willingness to reach across party
lines to achieve progress. When he takes
office, Snyder shouldn't get caught up in
bureaucratic politics and lose sight of the
importance of cooperation., He needs to
maintain his moderate platform and apply
this spirit of bipartisanship to the legisla-
tion he proposes.
Members of both political parties know
that drastic change is needed. As Dillon said
on Monday - and Snyder enforced by his
appointments - the only concrete way to
enact structural changes is to get rid of party
labels and work together. Snyder and Dillon
have demonstrated that they are willing to
put aside their political differences in order
to make dynamic changes for the state's
recovery. The state legislature should follow
their example.
Snyder's choice for treasurer has shown
his commitment to moderation and bipar-
tisanship. He should continue to utilize the
experience of both parties. But the true test
of a cooperative spirit will come when poli-
cies are brought before the legislature and
the governor's desk. Lansing should create a
custom of bipartisanship to produce legisla-
tion that will strengthen Michigan.

No excuse for drunk driving

n one of my first days in the
sixth-grade classroom where
I'm observing this semester as
part of the School
of Education's cer-
tification program,
I was mildly sur- .
prised to see that
the children say
the Pledge of Alle-
giance each morn-'
ing. I raised my
eyebrows at a cus- 4
tom that I thought RACHEL
had gone out of VANGILER
style, but dutifully
got to my feet,
placed my hand
over my heart and joined in.
Many of the children stood up
and recited the Pledge with me. But
at least a third of the students in the
room remained seated during the
Pledge. The amount of students that
remained seated really surprised -
and annoyed - me.
There's been controversy over the
words of the Pledge for about as long
as I can remember. Most of the debate
has focused around the inclusion of
the words "under God." It's a debate
that gets people pretty fired up - as
most debates about religion do. To
pacify the masses, many schools have
said that saying the "under God" part
is optional when reciting the pledge
- which seems reasonable, since com-
mitment to the U.S. should have noth-
ing to do with one's religious views.
In more recent years, some of the
controversy has shifted to focus on
whether or not schools can require
students to say the Pledge at all, and
if it can require them to stand. The
argument is that schools shouldn't
force their students to swear loyalty to
anything, especially considering that
students can come from a wide variety

of ethnic, national or religious back-
grounds that may prohibit them from
saying the Pledge.
There are good reasons to not say
the Pledge. There are even good rea-
sons to make the choice to remain
seated. But I don't believe that the
sixth graders were making some sort
of grand gesture to protest against
injustice or that most of them had a
religious obligation that prohibited
them from reciting the Pledge. At
their age, their conceptions of moral-
ity just haven't developed enough to
truly understand the implications of
devotion to a nation. Rather, it seemed
that they were exercising their right
to stay seated simply because they
could and without real consideration
of what remaining seated meant.
The discussion of the Pledge in
schools is more often one of why stu-
dents have the choice to say it and
to stand, rather than a discussion of
the meaning of the Pledge - both in
the words it includes and the impor-
tance it carries. Once students are old
enough to understand that the Pledge
is a solemn oath to remain loyal to the
nation, they should also understand
that they should have the common
courtesy to respect others' choice to
make that oath - even though they
are not required to make it them-
selves. Standing up during the Pledge
is a sign of that courtesy.
It's not just the Pledge. It ticks me
off when people at football games
in the Big House can't shut up long
enough for the band to play the
National Anthem as the Tri-Service
ROTC Color Guard raises the flag -
and that's only a few minutes. I glare
when people don't take off their caps.
At times like these, fans are offered
the opportunity to extend their loy-
alty to a team to loyalty to a nation
- which I guess makes particularly

good sense at a publically-funded uni-
versity. But I digress.
The point is that standing up while
the Pledge is recited or taking off your
cap and remaining silent during the
National Anthem is, if nothing else, a
sign of respect for something that so
many people hold so dear.
It's disrespectful-to
remain seated just
because you can.

If you've ever visited a house of
worship for a religion that you don't
belong to, you might get where I'm
coming from. in these cases, during
services, outsiders remain in a posture
of reflection and respectful silence.
They stand when the rest of the group
stands, they sit when the rest of the
group sits. They don't need to - and
probably shouldn't - recite prayers
they don't understand or believe in.
But they do need to recognize that
what's happening is fundamental to
their friends'belief system.
For a lot of people, the Pledge hasan
importance similar to the importance
of a prayer. Granted, few people treat
patriotism exactly like a religion. But
many do treat it as a guiding principle
of life. And it's a slap in the face to
these people to simply disregard the
belief that they hold so strongly. Stu-
dents and adults alike have the right to
not say the Pledge if they don't believe
in it. But they should have the respect
to stand up.

Michigan has just put into place a new law per-
taining to drunk driving that creates a category
of penalties for drivers operating a vehicle with
a blood alcohol content of .17 or higher. Under
the new law, a BAC level that is twice the current
legal limit will lead to penalties that are twice as
harsh. If drivers are caught with a BAC of .17 or
higher, their jail time and the duration of their
license suspension doubles. I'm thrilled to see
these higher penalties and would like to see even
more in the future.
Drunk driving is a civil offense that I find
unforgivable. It is a motorist's responsibility to
keep him or herself and others safe. I simply can't
understand why anyone would ever choose to
operate a vehicle while under the influence and
deliberately take such a huge risk. They're not
only endangering their own lives, but also taking
the lives of others around them into their own
drunken hands.
I know that this has been said to all of us a
million times before. Yet, people still continue to
drink and drive. And until someone in your fam-
ily has been affectedby drunk driving, it's impos-
sible to understand the consequences.
When my mom was 18 years old, she was a vic-
tim in a motorcycle accident. While driving down
M-40, a main county road on the west side of the
state, she was hit by a drunk driver. Though her
recollection of the events isn't clear, she knows
what happened from what others have told her.
The drunk driver was leaving a wedding recep-
tion and failed to look before pulling out of the
reception hall, causing the collision. My mom
was thrown from the motorcycle. After that, all

she can remember is waking up in the hospital
bed. She suffered a broken leg, a broken arm and,
essentially, a broken face. All of her facial bones
and her jaw had to be reconstructed. She suf-
fered through three weeks in a hospital, six more
weeks of recovery at home and three additional
months before making a full recovery. The ordeal
caused her to miss her senior year of high school
and countless other opportunities.
I'm sharing this story to show people just how
much one person's irresponsible decision can
affect someone else's life. Knowing what hap-
pened to my own mother has made me adamant-
ly against drunk driving. I will forever refuse to
drive after having even one drink because that
one drink still impairs your driving ability.
Michigan's new law is one I fully agree with.
If someone has consumed more than twice the
legal limit of alcohol, their judgment and motor
skills are severely depleted. In this condition,
they are basically incapable of doing anything.
While any level of alcohol in your system
makes it dangerous to drive, I'm happy to see that
the state has recognized that the level of intoxi-
cation corresponds with the severity of a driver's
impairment. obviously, it is far more dangerous
to drive at a BAC level of .17 than at a level of .08.
I support the state's decision to have different
levels of punishment. But I would like to see an
increase in the severity of consequences across
the board for drunk driving offenses. Mixing
alcohol and driving is a far more risky and dan-
gerous combination than many people think.

HEALTH CODE
From Page 1A
vicer's nightmare."
At Ford Field, home of the
Detroit Lions, the stadium is also
under county jurisdiction.
Eva Yusa, director of communi-
cations at Levy Restaurants - the
company that runs concessions at
Ford Field - wrote in an e-mail
interview that Ford Field vendors
appreciate the sporadic inspec-
tions.
Training and certification for
University health inspectors is
the same as the process for Washt-
enaw County inspectors, and the
University health code is the stan-
dard health code throughout the
state of Michigan. Rather than
issuing a letter or number grade
for inspections, inspectors deem
violations as critical or non-crit-
ical.
David Peters, OSEH repre-
sentative and stadium health
inspector, said practices that can
contaminate food and cause ill-
ness are considered critical viola-
tions. Practices that do not cause
disease or illness are non-critical.
According to 2009 OSEH
reports, Michigan Stadium
received eight violations during
last football season but only three
were critical:
EMPLOYEES DRINKING
FROM UNCOVERED
BEVERAGE CONTAINERS
Stadium employees drinking
from beverage containers are
required to do so with a lid and a
straw. Employees found drinking
from open containers are correct-
ed on site, and the stand is issued
a critical violation.
Peters said uncovered contain-
ers offer an opportunity for the
contamination of food.
"If (employees) go to handle
food, they can potentially con-
taminate it with something that
came out of their mouth, like a
germ or saliva," Peters said..
Jennifer Nord, OSEH repre-
sentative and a Michigan Stadium
health inspector, is present at
every game to ensure employees
are complying with regulations.
Nord said just seeing an open cup
would be a reason to hand out a
violation.

is "still not universally followed."
The report states that the policy
should be better implemented the
following season.
Peters said that since the
report, a more stringent policy
regarding hair restraints has been
put in place, and the issue has not
been a problem this season.
GRILL SANITIZER STRIPS IN
NEED OF REPLACEMENT
Grill stands are required to
have sanitizing strips that mea-
sure the concentration of ammo-
nia in the sanitizer, Last October,
the chemical strips of two grills
got wet and were no longer able to
determine ammonia concentra-
tion, and the concession stands
were cited with non-critical vio-
lations.
In order to correct the issue,
new test strips were affixed to the
grills that same day.
According to University offi-
cials, minor equipment issues like
this are fixed as quickly as pos-
sible.
EMPLOYEES SERVING ICE
WITHOUT GLOVES
Employees are required to
serve ice while wearing gloves
in order to avoid contamination.
Employees found serving ice
without gloves are cited with a
critical violation.
During the first three football
games last season, employees
were found serving ice while not
wearing gloves, according to the
2009 OSEH report.
These employees were provid-
ed with gloves by inspectors at the
time of inspection.
Chris Waldrop, director of the
Food Policy institute at the Con-
sumer Federation of
America, said food safety vio-
lations often occur during times
when employees are quickly serv-
ing spectators who want to return
to the athletic event - such as at
halftime and the moments before
a game starts.
"Employees are rushing to
serve lots of people in a short
amount of time, and they have less
time to address good food safety
practices," Waldrop said.
According to Peters, employees
have not been reprimanded for
not wearing gloves this season.

In October, one stand's employ-
ees brought in portable light fix-
tures for more lighting, and they
were cited with a non-critical vio-
lation.
To fix the problem, fluorescent
light fixtures were installed to
provide more light to workers and
the temporary light fixtures were
removed.
The second violation during the
stadium's construction involved
ice bins, which are required to be
cleaned in between home games.
On a few occasions, items like
soda bottles were stored in ice
bins during construction, and the
bins were not cleaned.
V/Gladieux Enterprises, Inc. -
the company in charge of stadium
concessions at the time - was
informed of the error and received
a critical violation. In response, a
new policy was put into place to
ensure ice bins were sanitized for
the remainder of the season.
According to Peters, neither of
these issues has caused repeated
violations this season, largely
because the construction has
ended.
HAND WASHING SIGNS
MISSING
Hand washing signs were not
present at two grill stands last
season. OSEH inspectors noticed
the health code infraction and
cited the concession stands with
non-critical violations.
To solve the issue, signs were
mounted above the sinks at both
stands before the next home
game.
According to Peters, the issue
has been resolved and hasn't been
repeated this season.
HOT WATER INSULATION
LINE SOILED
Papers used for hot water insu-
lation were found soiled with hot
chocolate powder last season and
were unable to be cleaned. As a
result, the concession stand was
given a non-critical violation.
While the violation was issued
last year, Peters wrote that the
problem still hasn't been fixed.
"The stadium maintenance
staff would ultimately need to
make this correction as opposed
to the concessionaire them-
selves," he wrote. "We would like
the paper insulation pipe wrap
replaced with PVC (plastic) pipe
wrap so that it can be easily wet
cleaned when hot chocolate pow-
der residues accumulate on it."
DESPITE VIOLATIONS,
CITATIONS HAVE BEEN
MINOR
As a result of the completion
of the renovations in August,
the stadium now features big-
ger kitchens, walk-in freezers,
food carving stations and private

suites.
In the past, only four types of
protein were offered to custom-
ers - hot dogs, chicken breasts,
hamburgers and bratwurst.
Now, nearly 15 types of proteins
are offered, according to health
inspectors.
"It's not just hot dogs any-
more," said Pam RKoczman, OSEH
manager and health inspection
supervisor.
While fans enjoy the wider
selection of food, Peters said the
variety requires more inspections
of the stands.
Koczman added that additions
to the stadium means a larger
number of health inspectors need
to be present at games.
While two inspectors - Peters
and Nord - were present at each
home game last season, at the
start of the season, there were
four inspectors present at the
stadium each game. Later in the
season the number was reduced
to three.
In addition to changes to the
venue, concessionaire manage-
ment has switched from V/Gla-
dieux Enterprises to the Sodexo
group - an international food
services and facilities manage-
ment group based in Gaihers-
berg, Md.
Nord said Sodexo imposes
stronger regulations to catch vio-
lations preemptively. Nord cited
increased use of temperature logs
- which document food tempera-
tures - and more frequent clean-
ing of counters as examples of the
company' s rigorous policy.
She said Sodexo does not allow
employees to use drinking cups
outside designated areas because
it eliminates the possibility of
receiving critical violations for
uncovered cups. This effort also
helps to maintain the stadium's
initiative to be "green" by elimi-
nating the need for plastic lids
and straws.
Nord said inspectors don't
know how this year's violations
will compare to those of previous
years because new service prac-
tices are still being put in place.
"It's a whole different ball
game," she said.
But University health inspec-
tors say the secret to the success
of the stadium health practices
is emphasizing education about
good health.
Designated stadium employees
participate in food safety training
before University stadiums open
for games. These leaders attend
annual training sessions and are
expected to educate their workers
- often volunteer groups - about
health policies.
"It's about teaching the profes-
sional food service staff, finding
what's wrong and correcting it,"
she said." It's not about delivering
a letter grade, which we believe
takes away from the education
component."

EMPLOYEES NOT WEARING IMPROPER LIGHTING AND
HAIR RESTRAINTS UNCLEAN ICE BINS

All Michigan Stadium employ-
ees are required to wear hats,
bandanas or other forms of hair
restraints while preparing and
serving food. Employees who
don't abide by the policy receive a
non-critical violation.
An OSEH report last October
stated that the majority of con-
cession stand employees wear
hair restraints, but the practice

Michigan Stadium underwent
construction last season, which in
part caused two health code viola-
tions.
Because the press box and cor-
porate suites were being built
above concession stands located
at the West side of the stadium,
workers did not receive adequate
natural daylight while preparing
and serving food.


FOUR LOKO
From Page 1A
ty's Alcohol Policy and Community
Initiatives Program administra-
tor, said she feels alcoholic energy
drinks pose a significant danger
to students on campus. She added
that the effect of the mixture of
caffeine and alcohol can make it
difficult for consumers to deter-
mine their levels of intoxication.
"I think it removes one of the
tools that people use to gauge
when they've had enough, because
it sends the brain that mixed mes-
sage," Desprez said.
She said based on student anec-
dotes with the drink, she believes
that students will understand the
reasons underlying the ban.
"Most of them have said, 'I've
tried it and I wouldn't try it again'
or I think for most people they
see the harm that has happened
to their friends," said Desprez.
"They're actually seeing what's
going on, and that actually has
been more powerful than anything
else."
In a statement issued by Phusion
Projects - manufacturer of Four
Loko - the company expressed its
intent to "pursue all legal options
and vigorously challenge the
Commission's action as procedur-
ally and substantively deficient
well before the ban would go into
effect."
Phusion Projects criticized what
it called the commission's "precipi-
tous and ill-conceived"vote, which
was made by three of the five com-
missioners. The manufacturer
added that the ban will be detri-
mental to many businesses in the

state.
Martin said should the ban be
challenged, the final verdict will
likely depend on the United States
Food and Drug Administration's
analysis.
"If they revisit the ban ... then
the commission can also look to
its labeling rules and possibly
force the manufacturers to change
their packaging and labeling of the
product," she said.
Phusion Projects stated that the
amount of alcohol present in Four
Loko is comparable to that of some
beers and wines and that the caf-
feine content is similar to that of
a tall Starbucks coffee. The state-
ment also addressed Four Loko's
label, saying all "products fea-
ture prominent labels that clearly
show that the beverages contain
alcohol and can only be sold to
adults of legal drinking age."
The statement added that the
labeling of Four Loko is no dif-
ferent from that applied to hard
liquor containers, saying that
"even alcoholic beverages with-
out caffeine come in flavors and
brightly colored cans. Today
bubble gum, raspberry and blue-
berry vodkas - which have sev-
eral times the alcohol content of a
Four Loko - are all on the mar-
ket."
Dick Sheer, owner of Village
Corner, which closed down its
South University Avenue location
on Nov. 6, said he did not recog-
nize at first that Four Loko was
alcoholic.
"I work on the invoices and
bookkeeping, and the first time I
saw some on an invoice I had to
ask the rest of the staff whether
this was alcoholic or not, because

it's just like another energy drink,
and some of the beer distributors
carry some non-alcoholic bever-
ages," Sheer said.
Sheer added that alcoholic ener-
gy drinks have gained popularity
as of late.
"It languished for a little while
and then just exploded," Sheer
said. "I guess word just got around,
and then it became a big, big deal.
But still, it's such a small percent-
age of the overall alcoholic bever-
age business, but I don't know, if
it had been allowed to grow, who
knows?"
Sheer said he expects a rush of
customers following the ban, com-

ing in to stock up on drinks like
Four Loko, and said "some cans
may never get opened."
LSA sophomore Mary Rodri-
guez said she is a huge fan of Four
Loko and drinks it all the time
despite health risks.
"It's really bad for you ... but, I'm
only young once," Rodriguez said.
Rodriguez said she is very dis-
appointed that irresponsible con-
sumption of the drink has been the
impetus behind the ban on Four
Loko.
"I went and I bought like 60 of
them," Rodriguez said. "I'm really
sad that it's not going to be there
anymore."

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.cam

On 2009 ticket form, no line for employees
to agree to NCAA ticket distribution rules


From Page 1A
violations, University spokesman
Rick Fitzgerald said in a recent
interview.
"There were no violations,"
Fitzgerald said. "(The memo) was
in response to what is a routine
annual audit that the University
Audits does in Athletics. It was a
follow up to that routine audit."
The memo - written by Carol
Senneff, executive director of Uni-
versity Audits, Senior Audit Man-
ager Jennifer Vitale and Senior
Auditors Lisa Beymer and Megan
Mackson - states that tickets for
individual games were erroneously
excluded from employees' taxable
income.
"Presently, the value of season
tickets provided to staff members
is included in an employee's taxable
earnings," the memo stated. "Tick-

ets for individual games, how-
ever, are not included. University
Audits and the Tax Director have
determined that the value of these
tickets should be included with an
employee's taxable earnings."
in an e-mail to the Daily, Fitzger-
ald clarified the policy by writing
that all complimentary individual
tickets to sold out games are con-
sidered taxable earnings.
"When something is being given
away, it intrinsically does not hold
the same value as something for
which there are limited quantities
in high demand," he wrote. "Since
the value of each is significantly
different, the tax liability is as well.
So, when there are a number of
tickets, there is no value. But when
a game is sold out, the ... market
value is different."
For over 40 years, all Athletic
Department employees have had

the option of receiving compli-
mentary Michigan football or bas-
ketball tickets. Approximately 275
employees elected to receive com-
plimentary season football tickets,
while about 90 employees received
complimentary season basketball
tickets, Fitzgerald reported.
Athletic Department staff mem-
bers who don't want to get full-sea-
son basketball tickets can choose
to take part in an individual game
ticket pool, Fitzgerald wrote in
the e-mail. As a part of the pool, a
select number of tickets are given
away on a first-come-first-serve
weekly basis for all home games.
Though football tickets are com-
plimentary to all Athletic Depart-
ment employees, those who are
not on the football program's staff
and receive the tickets are required
to pay a Preferred Seating Dona-
tion - a required donation which

individuals who are interested in
purchasing select football, basket-
ball and hockey season tickets must
make for the right to purchase the
season tickets.
To receive the tickets, Athletic
Department employees are also
required to sign a form recogniz-
ing that their use of the tickets will
comply with University regula-
tions, Fitzgerald said.
However, the management advi-
sory memorandum identifies an
error in the form. The contract did
not include a signature line for the
employee to declare compliance
with NCAA ticket distribution reg-
ulations.
"The form used to track employ-
ees who sign up for these tickets
includes an attestation statement
acknowledgingthat the employees'
use of the tickets will comply with
NCAA regulations," the memo-

randum states. "The statement
begins'with my signature, Ihereby
affirm...' However, there is no sig-
nature line included on the form.
The form should be modified so
employees can document account-
ability for their tickets."
The policy requiring employees
to sign the form is, in actuality, a
University policy - not an NCAA
policy - Fitzgerald said.
"That's an internal University
policy," Fitzgerald said. "None of
this constituted any violation of
NCAA regulations."
The policy was enacted by the
University to ensure that Athletic
Department employees are not giv-
ing or sellingtheir tickets to athlet-
ic boosters or recruits, Fitzgerald
wrote in the e-mail.
"The recommendation from
University Audit to change the
form was to simply reinforce the

awareness of the ticket policy and
ensure all staff members read the
document," Fitzgerald wrote. "The
policy has always remained the
same."
Prior to the memorandum's
release, "virtually all" of the
forms went unsigned, according
to Fitzgerald. A copy of the new
form released to the Daily which
was introduced in 2009 after the
memo was written, states that Ath-
letic Department employees can't,
in accordance with NCAA rules,
give their complimentary tickets to
student-athletes, recruits and their
family members or agents.
The form also lays out the Uni-
versity policy that prohibits the
sale of complimentary tickets. Vio-
lation of this policy, according to
the form, could result in termina-
tion of employment or loss of sea-
son tickets.

With bowl game comes
valuable practice time

Rust brothers to face
off in weekend series

ractice? We talkin' 'bout
practice?
Well...yes.
The word "practice" has sort of
defined the Michigan football team
over the past
year and change,
due to a thor-
ough NCAA
investigation
that followed
from allegations
that the team
violated limits
on mandatory NICOLE
practice, among AUERBACH
other offenses.
At the con-
clusion of its own investigation last
May, the University instituted self-
imposed practice limitations: 130
fewer hours than the allotted time
over twoyears.During aNov.4press
conference following public release
of the NCAA's sanctions - one more
year of probation, bringing the total
to three, and no additional practice
time cuts - Rodriguez said the team
had thus far cut 32 hours.
That's a lot of talk about practice.
There's also been buzz around
campus about this little thing we
call bowl eligibility. For the first time
in three years, Michigan is going to
have a postseason.
"We talked about it and thought
about it," Michigan coach Rich
Rodriguez said after the Wolverines'
sixth win of the season. "That was
important for us, and it's important
for us now to understand that every
game after this is even more impor-
tant."
But the bowl appearance itself is
not the most important part of the
bowl-eligibility package. This sea-
son will be Rodriguez's first chance
to run practices past November, as
Michigan will get 15 extra practices
to prepare for its bowl game.
Each week, Rodriguez says he
sees improvement from his young
players in practice. He better - eight
freshmen and sophomores played
last Saturday.
And each game gives these young
players experience, but so does
each practice - more time to learn
schemes, understand the playbook,
work on fundamentals, all that good
stuff. And, of course, more bond-
ing for what already appears to be a

By MARK BURNS
Daily SportsEditor
When Michigan hockey senior
Matt Rust skates around in warm-
ups this upcoming Friday at Yost Ice
Arena, he'll see his little brother at
the opposite end of the rink - no,
not Michigan State.
Instead, freshman forward
Bryan Rust will be donning Notre
Dame's blue and gold, a team cur-
rently atop the conference, one
point ahead of the Wolverines (4-1-
1-0 CCHA, 5-2-3 overall).
It will be the first time besides
last year's game against the U.S.
National Team Development Pro-
gram Under-18 squad - in which
the younger Rust played for the Ann
Arbor-based program - that the
two brothers have faced each other.
Prior to playing for the USNTDP,
Bryan skated for Honeybaked, a
AAA program based out of metro
Detroit. While playing for the elite
program, Michigan assistant coach
Mel Pearson observed Bryan's
game. But Pearson and the Wolver-
ines didn't successfully secure the
younger brother's commitment.
"We talked to Bryan, and he was
a very good hockey player," Pearson
said. "We were well aware of him
when he played atcHoneybaked, and
then over at the U.S. program. He
made an early decision and unfortu-
nately, he wanted to get it out of the
way, and we didn't get a chance to
really talk to him a whole lot about
coming to Michigan."
Up until now, Bryan has played
in all nine games for the Fight-
ing Irish (4-1-1-1, 6-2-1), tallying
a goal and an assist while play-
ing on coach Jeff Jackson's third
line. And even though the broth-
ers have different styles of play
- with Matt playing a more defen-
sive brand of hockey compared to
Bryan's power-forward style -
both have something to prove in
the two-game series.
According to Matt, it's been the

ARIEL BOND/Daily
Senior forward Matt Rust will face off against his brother, Bryan, this weekend.

State. He, as well as the other freshmen, will benefit from extra bowl practices.

close-knit team.
"That bond you have with your
team is pretty tight, and being able
to extend that another month for a
bowl game I think is really impor-
tant for our seniors," Rodriguez said
Monday.
But while everybody's talking
about how great it is for the seniors
and coaches that Michigan will be
going to a bowl, don't forget about
the freshmen and sophomores.
They receive something invalu-
able from the extra time on the prac-
tice field - the potential to improve.
After all, isn't that what the coaching
staff has said all season?
That it's painful to play with youth
now, but man, next year they'll be
good?
Throw in extra practices and a
high-profile (or maybe not so high-
profile) bowligame, andthat can only
help. This is especially important as
the team looks to cutback on regular
practice time this year and next.

Why do some freshmen (like
quarterbacks Tate Forcier and
Devin Gardner) enroll early? It's not
because they're sick of high school or
want to miss prom.
It's for those extra 15 spring prac-
tices at Michigan. The extra time to
learn the system. The opportunity to
develop chemistry with teammates.
That kind of practice is invaluable
when, especially for a team so young.
Forcier earned the starting job
last year in large part because of that
extra practice time. He knew the
playbook best, and he'd worked with
the running backs and wide receiv-
ers more than Denard Robinson did
when he arrived in August.
Fifteen practices makes a huge
difference.
That's why the bowl game is
important - for those December
practices, not just the game itself.

younger brother who's been "talk-
ing a little bit of smack."
"He sent me a little text, 'Matt,
you better be ready'," the older
Rust said. "I think he's a little
scared."
Matt added that he thinks that
in the back of Bryan's mind, "he
wants to make sure everyone knows
he did this himself" and didn't navi-
gate his way to Division I college
hockey because of his brother's suc-
cess or the name on the back of his
jersey.
And while it certainly sounds cli-
ch6, Matt admitted after Wednes-
day's practice, he thinks it's natural
for ayoungerbrothertobeovershad-
owed by an older sibling.With Bryan
finally making it to South Bend, he
could vault himself out of his older
brother's shadow and cement his
own identity in the CCHA.
"I personally think my brother is

a better player than me," Matt said.
"He's got a lot of skills and smarts,
and his hard work has paid off. The
kid has changed completely from
when he was younger until where
he is now."
As Michigan coach Red Beren-
son said Wednesday, both the Wol-
verines and the Fighting Irish are
trying to bounce back from a year
in which they finished in the lower
half of the conference, with Michi-
gan in seventh place and Notre
Dame in ninth. Both teams are
"looking to prove something" after
the less-than-stellar regular-season
finishes last season.
Just don't let the big brother fool
you - he won't be taking it easy on
Bryan.
"I've been letting him have it a
little bit this week and definitely
making sure he knows his role out
there."


A hot start for club golf team

Three months after
its founding, team
has won its first two
tournaments.
ByZACH HELFAND
For the Daily
It started in March with a
handshake over lunch in Prague
between two University stu-
dents studying abroad. There,
LSA seniors Roger Sauerhaft and
Kevin Buzard decided between
bites that the idea that they had
been floating around would
become a reality.
They would bring a club golf
team to Michigan.
Some 4,400 miles away and
four months later in Ann Arbor,
incoming freshman John Gordy
and sophomore Ryan Alger had
the same idea. They began mov-
ing forward.
"About a couple weeks into it,
we realized that two other kids
were doing the exact same thing,"
Gordy said. "So we just teamed up
with them."
Now, just three months since
its inception, the team has earned
a trip to the National Colle-
giate Club Golf Association Fall
Championship at Bryant Park
golf course in Greensboro, North
Carolina by winning its first two
tournaments. Coincidentally, this
course was the site of senior var-
sity golfer Lion Kim's victory in
the U.S. Amateur Public Links
Championship, which earned him
a berth in the Masters.
"At the beginning of the school

year, Roger was saying his goal
was for us to win a National
Championship, and I thought that
was kind of far-fetched," senior
Paul Sefcovic, who made the all-
tournament team at the second
event, said. "But once we won
those first two regional tourna-
ments, I was kind of thinking,
'We've actually got something
pretty good going here.' .. So I
think we've definitely got a shot."
The team won the first regional
tournament by six strokes, beat-
ing club teams from Wisconsin,
Dayton and Miami (Ohio), among
others, and later cruised to a
15-stroke victory in the second.
The team is currently undefeated
in tournament play, despite not
even existing long enough to be
included on the NCCGA website.
"Because it's our first year,
when we went to the Midwest
Regional Tournaments, the other
teams were kind of surprised that
Michigan was even there, because
they'd never heard of our team
before," Gordy said.
Perhaps the biggest reason for
the team's success is its depth.
During the summer, Sauerhaft,
the team's president, who is also
a member of the Daily's editorial
staff, worked to recruit members to
the newly formed club. With help
from the other original four, he sent
mass e-mails, talked to golfers that
he knew, and worked on getting
range times and sponsors.
Eventually, the pieces started
falling into place.
"Our biggest event was when
we were at Festifall, and we
brought out a golf bag, and just
seeing a golf bag out there, so
many people just came up to us,"

Buzard said. "We had alot of kids,
a lot of upperclassmen who came
up and they just said to us, 'Final-
ly, Michigan finally got a club golf
team.'"
As the club was getting off the
ground, golf company TourEdge
signed as a sponsor, and a local
golf facility called Miles of Golf
gave the team discounted rates.
"I really commend (Sauerhaft)
for the effort and the energy that
it's taken to follow through with
it, and obviously they've been
extremely successful," said Doug
Davis, vice president and co-
founder of Miles of Golf.
By the start of the season, the
team had enough talent to com-
pete with the best club teams in
the region.
"I know personally a lot of the
guys on the team that I played
with in high school," Gordy said.
"A lot of them were All-Staters in
high school and got offers to go
play in college, but just for one
reason or another wanted to go to
the University of Michigan."
While talented, the club of
about 30 members is not limited
to scratch golfers.
"We're really hoping ... that
someday we can actually work
with other clubs, other organiza-
tions and also less skilled golfers
on our team and really help them
in terms of their game and help
them fall in love with golf. It's
really to improve your game of
golf witha bunch of friends," said
Buzard.
For now, the team is concen-
trating on making sure that the
idea that began in Prague leads
to some nice hardware in Greens-
boro.

Young Wolverines to rely
on last season's nucleus

ByEVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan women's basketball
coach Kevin Borseth sat alone at a
table during Big Ten Media Day on
October 29. All around him, some of
the best players and coaches in the
country answered questions about
the upcoming season. Borseth's
table was empty for most of the day,
with the exception a former beat
writer or two coming over to talk
every so often. He knows his team
doesn't enjoy the fanfare as the pro-
grams at Ohio State and Iowa do.
But the lack of visitors doesn't faze
Borseth, as he pulls out a crossword
puzzle and goes to work.
It would be an understatement
to say that Michigan is flying under
the radar entering this season. The
Wolverines are not ranked in the
top three in either of the Big Ten
preseason and media polls and have
no players named to the preseason
All-Big Ten teams.
Borseth was the first coach to
speak during Big Ten media day,
and he started off his press confer-
ence by saying, "It's my job to make
sure these microphones work soyou
can hear everyone else afterwards."
Borseth seems to relish the lack
of attention. He breaks out of his
crossword-induced bubble when he
begins to talk about his team, one
with a scary dearth experience. The
team's youth is a major reason for its
low profile early on, somethingthat
Borseth understands completely.
"Jury is always out on young
teams," Borseth said. "And we cer-
tainly are young."
The Wolverines return only one
senior, but if one is all you get then
guard Veronica Hicks is a good one
to have. She was named Michigan's
most valuable player last year and
was an All-Big Ten Honorable Men-
tion. Hicks will be the go-to scorer
this year, but her role goes beyond
just offense. Borseth calls Hicks the
leader and rock of the team, a role
that she embraces.
She bears the responsibility of

showing a green roster the right
way to do things, and so far, she
has led the team through offseason
workouts by being vocal and work-
ing hard.
"I think everybody knew what
they wanted to work- on this sum-
mer, and instead of just talking
about it we all went out and did it,"
Hicks said. "We have seen improve-
ments all around as a team."
The other two returning starters
are junior guard/forward Carmen
Reynolds and sophomore guard
Jenny Ryan. Reynolds was also an
All-Big Ten Honorable Mention,
mostly because her three-point
percentage was the 10th best in the
country. For this team to be success-
ful, Reynolds must continue to be a
shooting threat to take some of the
offensive pressure off of Hicks. But
her impactgoes beyond that.
"I definitely want to step up
vocally because we are a younger
team, and if I carry myself with con-
fidence everyone else will follow,"
Reynolds said.
The team will need its players to
shoot consistently from the outside
in order to succeed on the offensive
end. If Reynolds can shoot like she
has in past seasons, the Michigan
offense will be in good shape.
On the other side of the spectrum
is Ryan, Michigan's defensive play-
er of the year last season. Known
for her rebounding abilities, Ryan
understands that she has to step up
offensivelyas well this year.
"I'm not saying I don't need to
continuetoimproveonmydefense,"
Ryan said at Michigan Media Day
last month. "But this year from an
offensive standpoint, I need to be a
threat because last year I felt that
people could relax on me defen-
sively."
As far as experience goes, that's
it. Besides those three players,
Michigan does not have anyone on
its roster who played more than 10
minutes agame lastseason.
"We have three players coming
back fromlastseason with consider-
able experience and other than that

we have a bunch of greenhorns,"
Borseth said."They have ability, but
you just don't know until you see
them on the court."
While the Wolverines won't
know exactly what they have in
their arsenal until the season is
underway, there are several young
players predicted to get signifi-
cant playing time. Junior Courtney
Boylan is the team's projected start-
ing point guard and will see a lot of
the court this season. Boylan is list-
ed as a generous 5-foot-7, but plays
with an aggressive style that makes
up for her lack of size.
Sophomore Sam Arnold and
freshman Val Driscoll will likely
split the playing time at center,
unless Borseth decides to go with
a smaller, quicker lineup. Arnold
didn't get a lot of playing time last
year, but has put in plenty of offsea-
son work and has been praised for
her improvement by both Borseth
and Hicks. She is 6-foot-4, but runs
the floor better than Driscoll and is
more of a threat from the outside.
Driscoll plays like a true cen-
ter and should bring an element
of toughness to the post. There is
a chance she could be one of the
team's leading rebounders this sea-
son, depending on how quickly she
can pick up the college game.

about Hicks and the answer will
sound familiar - she is always

Hicks's disciplined mental-
ity comes through in the class-
room, too. She has taken classes
every summer since she's been
on campus so that she could
graduate this spring with a
degree in industrial and opera-
tions engineering.
It might seem odd that a play-
er would have a poster of her
SAMANTHA TRAUBEN/Daily own teammate in her locker.
But get to know Hicks, and you
just might consider grabbing
one for yourself.

Junior guard/forward Carmen Reynolds brings a 3-point shooting spark to the Wolverines.
Stiff competition in the Bil

grade and soon after began
playing AAU basketball. That's
when her commitment to bas-
ketball started to get serious -
she played on an AAU team that
featured players now playing
at Notre Dame, Ohio State and
Indiana.
"Competing with them every
day, you had to get better,"
Hicks said. "I just loved to play,
and I played whenever I could."
Hicks quickly began to utilize
her potential. By the end of her
freshman season in high school,
she was on the varsity team at
Thornwood High in suburban
Chicago.
"(Getting moved up to var-
sity) really showed me that I
could compete at a high level,"
Hicks said. "Just being able to
see the competition and what
it's like in the playoffs was
huge."
Two weeks into her sopho-
more year, she had taken hold
of the starting point guard posi-
tion. By the end of that year, she
already had offers from 39 dif-
ferent universities, including
some Division-I programs. But
Michigan was not one of them.
At the beginning of her senior
year, she finally received a let-
ter from the Wolverines, and it
was different from the others.
"They sent us more than just
a regular envelope," Luther
recalled. "They sent her a big
manila envelope, and in it they
wrote things that they appreci-
ate about her character, her ath-
letic ability and her academics.
It was a very nice package."
Just a couple of months later,
Veronica signed her letter of
intent to play for Michigan.
Luther, a Northwestern grad,
was ecstatic that his daughter
would be playing in the Big Ten.
With a little faith, the decision
was a no-brainer for the Hicks
family.
"Everyone recognizes the
block 'M'," Veronica said. "It's
a big symbol both athletically
and academically, and I knew I
wanted to play in the Big Ten. I
really wanted to go somewhere
where I could thrive and not
really have to be at odds with
teammates over certain things.
We're a praying, playful family,
and we prayed about it. It was
just meant for me to be here.
God sent me to Michigan so I
just came."
And when she came to Ann
Arbor, she made sure that she
didn't leave her faith behind.
LIVING THROUGH FAITH
It's a pretty common sight to
see an athlete listening to his or
her iPod before a game.
But take a look at what Veron-
ica Hicks is listening to, and you
might do a double take.
"It's funny because she's
pretty quiet before games,"
Boylan said. "She always listens
to this one Christian song that
gets her super pumped up. She
just goes to the corner of the
locker room and starts rockin'
out to her Christian music."
For Hicks, "Rain Down on
Me" by Lonnie Hunter serves
more of a purpose than to just
pump her up.

"When I'm on the court,
sometimes I just feel like I don't
even want to be the one in con-
trol," Hicks said. "It's kind of
like, 'You know God, if you want
to take over from here and just
do what you do through me, go
ahead.' So it just kind of gets my
spirit into it."
It's faith that motivates
Hicks every day. Growing up
in a tight-knit family, religion
was always important, as her
parents, Luther and Brenda,
made sure that she was exposed
to faith at an early age. Veron-
ica began going to church with
her family as soon as she could
walk, and she attended a Chris-
tian grade school through sixth
grade.
"She keeps her eye on God,"
said Tasha Harris, Veronica's
older sister. "That helps us stay
grounded and loving. She fin-
ishes what she starts and she is
a woman of God.
A similar tone rings true in
the locker room, as Hicks leads
the team in prayer before each
game.
"I know that where I am right
now is because of God," Hicks
said, "and that's why I'm always
very confident and optimistic
because I have a strong faith
that everything is going to turn
out for my good."
A CONFIDENT LEADER
Michigan coach Kevin Bors-
eth experienced Hicks's confi-
dence the first time he met with
her in the fall of 2007. Borseth
knew little about her because
he, too, was new to Michigan.
He was hired at the start of
Hicks's freshman campaign.
"Roni set up a meeting with
me, and I just thought, 'Oh boy,
here comes another meeting
where the player's going to tell
me that they deserve to play,"'
Borseth recalled on Monday.
"But she just said, 'Coach, all I
can tell you is that one of these
days you're gonna look down on
the bench and you're gonna say,
'I need to get her in the game.''
And that kind of brought a smile
to my face."
That confidence has only
grown since Hicks's arrival at
Ann Arbor. She has improved in
nearly every statistical category
in each of her first three years
at Michigan. But this year,
Hicks still has some unfinished
business.
"I'm grateful for the stage
I'm at right now, but there's still
things that we haven't accom-
plished," she said. "There's
some championships I'd like
to get, some goals I'd like to
achieve on and off the court. I
haven't graduated yet, so I've
still got to do that. I'd like to 4
bring a championship to Michi-
gan before I leave it, and since
it's my last year, it has to be this
year."
Because of its youth and the
fact there is only one senior on
the team, many will question 4
Michigan's chances for success
this season.
But that one senior is Veron-
ica Hicks.
And sometimes you just gotta
have a little faith.

Daily Sports Writer
Preseason predictions have the
Michigan women's basketball team
in the middle of the conference
heap. Of course, as a late-season
tournament spark showed lastyear,
the Wolverines are capable of rising
above expectations.
This season, it will take passion-
ate play to compete in a Big Ten that
should be solid from top to bottom.
The league is arguably stronger
than ever, and it's considered one of
the toughest in the nation.
No team in the Big Ten can be
taken for granted.
The Wolverines return only
three players with considerable
experience, including just one
senior, guard Veronica Hicks. But
according to Hicks, Michigan does
not look at that as a disadvantage.
"Having new players, having
a new look, having a new way of
playing is really gonna show when
wegetout on the court," Hicks said
two weeks ago at Big Ten Media
Day in Chicago.
The Wolverines are optimistic,
but they will face still competition
in the conference, especially from
Ohio State, Iowa, and Michigan
State, the top three teams in both
polls, respectively.
Ohio State remains a domi-
nant competitor, returning all five
starters from last year - including
powerhouse senior center Jantel
Lavender. Last season, Lavender

averaged a double-double, with2l.4
points and 10.3 rebounds per game.
Those numbers ranked ninth and
25th in the nation. Lavender, the
three-time reigning Big Ten Player
of the Year, earned the preseason
honor for the third straight season.
Lavender, along with junior
guard Samantha Prahalis make a
dominant duo. Prahalis, earned a
spot on the preseason Big Ten team
along with Lavender, and was sec-
ond in the nation with eight assists
pergame last season. Lavender and
Prahalis were two of three Big Ten
standouts selected to the Wade and
Wooden award watch lists for the
nation's best player this summer.
Last season, this Buckeye com-
bination led the team to its sixth
straight Big Ten Championship.
Ohio State also claimed the 2009-
2010 Big Ten Tournament title.
"We most definitely have a tar-
get on our back," Lavendar said
during Big Ten Media Day. "I
mean, I would if somebody was in
my conference and they kept win-
ning. Thatd be my focus for the
whole season. But it's fun being on
top, it's fun being the target, it's fun
being the ones that everyone wants
to beat. It makes you that much
tougher."
Even Northwestern, a program
that traditionally hasn't had suc-
cess, is expected tobetough. Coach
Joe McKeown, going into his third
season, has installed new systems
and feverishly recruited top ath-
letes. McKeown could cturn the

Wildcats into the surprise team of
the Big Ten, building around super-
star senior center Amy Jaeschke.
"There are so many good teams
in this conference," Iowa coach
Lisa Bluder said. "It used to be
where maybe you look at the bot-
tom of the conference and think,
'Oh, there's a 'W,' there's a 'W.' But
there are no 'W's' on our schedule
anymore."'
Iowa, besides Ohio State, is
the only other team to return all
five starters. That includes senior
guard Kachine Alexander - who
was selected to both the Wade and
Wooden Award watch lists and
earned a spot on the preseason
All-Big Ten team - and last sea-
son's Big Ten Freshman of the Year,
Jaime Printy. The Hawkeyes are
slated to finish second after ending
last season tied for third and mak-
ing a run to the Big Ten Tourna-
ment final.
The Big Ten should be a battle
to the end. The conference has 17
All-Big Ten performers returning
to their respective teams, includ-
ing four first-team members and the
Big Ten Player and Freshman of the
Year. With dominant teams return-
ing and typical underdogs coming
out swinging, it's impossible to pre-
dict whowill come outontop.
"Inthepast,notalloftheseteams
were able to contest," Lavender
said. "Before you could say, 'Well,
Ohio State is going to win.' But now
everybody is in the dog fight to be
thenext BigTenchampion."

A NATURAL GIFT
From the get-go, Luther Hicks
could tell that his daughter had
talent. When Veronica was only
three years old, he took her out
to a parking lot near their Chi-
cago home with a little ball -
the type that you would find
in a basket at the end of the toy
aisle at Target. He told her to
bounce the ball in front of her-
self and try to dribble. Luther
leaned against the nearest tree
and just watched. The rest was
up to Veronica.
"As soon as I told her, she
took off running on what I
guess would be her first fast
break," Luther said in an inter-
view with the Daily. "She drib-
bled with one hand in front of
herself on a dead sprint and did
not lose the ball. I was stunned,
because I never showed her
anything. It was just natural."
Veronica downplayed the sig-
nificance of the event.
"I'm always just like, 'Well
Dad, I'm pretty sure there's
some energetic three-year-olds
running around,' " she joked on
Monday. "But you got to love
that he's proud of me, and I
really appreciate his support."
Natural ability or not, Hicks
played a variety of sports
growing up. She took up ten-
nis, swimming and karate, and
even had a brief stint in cheer-
leading. But by sixth grade, she
knew which sport was hers.
She started playing competi-
tively at her school in seventh

nstage at the Power Center, three of the
starring actors in the upcoming Music, The-
atre & Dance opera "The Elixir of Love"
rehearse a scene. Dressed in plainclothes in
front of an imitation-stucco archway, they
belt out the same several measures repeatedly. A guy twirls
a girl once, twice, then attempts to sit her on his knee -
which she misses. The three actors laugh, and the director
sitting in the center of the audience chuckles and explains
the proper motion.
Behind a curtain stage right, stage manager Michelle Elias,
an MT&D senior, watches the goings-on from a small col-
ored TV screen. Next to it is another screen, this one in black
and white and displaying the pit, currently home to just one
rehearsal pianist. It's the second night oftech week for "Elix-
ir," and, though the chorus has yet to arrive and the stage is
sparsely populated, behind the arch is another drama.
Murmuring into her headset, Elias communicates with her
assistant stage managers and the sound and lighting techni-
cians over two radio channels while viewing the onstage
action. She cues members of the run crew - the backstage
hands in charge of sets and props during a show's run - non-
verbally, using a system of switches and lights.
"I can flip the switch on, and that's the warning, and flip-
ping the switch off is the 'go.' And so when the light goes off,
you pull the rail," Elias said. Backstage, the "rail" refers to the
system of ropes that raise set pieces, lights or curtains.
Elias will be behind the scenes at every performance of
"Elixir of Love," as she has done as stage manager for several
other plays and musicals before it.
"I'm there through the entire process, from beginning to
end," she said. And by this point, though an audience has yet
to see it, Elias's show is nearing the end of a long road to its
debut.
"What you see onstage, that's the design, that's the final
product," said MT&D senior Corey Lubowich, who designed
the costumes and scenery for StarKid Potter's "A Very Potter
Sequel" in May.
Though they themselves remain invisible to most theater-
goers, designers have labored over every aspect of how their
shows will look, and opening night represents the culmina-
tion of their jobs.
"It's the process of it being in your head, to being in the
shop, to being in the rehearsal room and then being onstage,"
said MT&D senior Shawn McCulloch, the costume designer
for last month's musical "Into the Woods."
And for Elias, Lubowich, McCulloch and the students
behind the scenes of any 'U' production, this process of
bringing the script to life begins months before the show
opens its doors.
Creating a world
Being picked to design a mainstage production at the Uni-
versity is no small honor.

"Within the University shows, you work your way up to
actually designing a mainstage," Lubowich said. "You work
backstage, you work in the shop, you sort of get assignments
along the way before you're allowed."
Student mainstage designers tend to come from the MT&D
Design & Production program, and their classes are often
like mock productions.
"You do it all hypothetically," McCulloch said. in his
courses, he designs the costumes for made-up shows and
then finds the sample fabrics that best match each character.
But of course, classwork for designers is very different
from the real thing. Before "Into the Woods," McCulloch was
used to having a professor constantly looking over his shoul-
der. For that show, he was on his own to design after meeting

of it, and I get to play

you are paid to create
fake worlds and
entertain people.
-Michelle Elias, MT&D senior
with his director in April to discuss the basics.
Fifth-year MT&D senior Adam McCarthy, the lighting
designer for "Pentecost," also started out by meeting with his
director. But from the very beginning, lighting is defined and
differentiated from scenic and costume design by its lack of
physicality.
"The director and I had a couple of meetings (and) talked
about more, sort of, the abstract qualities of the show - what
it's about, how it 'works,' " McCarthy said.
"In particular with the school productions, what gener-
ally happens is the scenic designer and the costume designer
meet with the director far before the lighting designer and
sort of create the world, the theme and the concept of the
play," he added. "And at that point the lighting designer sort
of responds to their work."
Since "Pentecost" was set in an abandoned Eastern Euro-

pean church, McCarthy spent his summer doing research on
churches, but he didn't start making actual designs until fur-
ther along in the process.
McCulloch had to approach the physical costume designs
for "Into the Woods" much earlier, but his work still began
with a mad hunt for information.
"A lot of designers, when they design a show, they don't
wantto see other productions," he admitted. "With this show,
there's a DVD recording of when Bernadette Peters was in it
on Broadway, in the original production, and I saw that years
ago. SoI kind of owned up to the fact that I've already seen it
and know about it, soI looked at lots of productions."
Once McCulloch had finished his research - which
included learning the traditional garb of the princes and
peasants who roam the woods of his show - he began to
render his ideas. A costume designer's renderings are tra-
ditionally done in watercolor on paper but nowadays can
extend into any medium, including Photoshop. A rendering
is a detailed portrait, with the subject standing in a typical
pose and dressed in the most accurately colored and textured
clothing possible.
"I really tried to have fun with the stepmother and stepsis-
ters," McCulloch said. "The two princes are pretty directly
related to research of Prince Albert and Napoleon...(but) I've
never seen a wolf that looked like mine."
McCulloch's Wolf wore fur-covered pants but was bare
from the waist up. Since designers often make their render-
ings before a show is cast, making sure the ors fit the gen-
eral concept behind their costumes is important.
"One of the things I talked (about)with the director very
early on was that he wanted the Wolf to be dangerous yet
sexy," he said. "So one of the big concerns with the Wolf was,
do we have a guy who has the goods? And we did."
For Lubowich, specific actors weren't a concern when con-
ceptualizing the set design for "A Very Potter Sequel." Work-
ing on an adaptation of a well known series, he had his show's
underlyingmaterial right in front of him, and the "Harry Pot-
ter" books themselves were his inspiration: The set for the
sequel was based on the American cover of the first book.
"I really loved the art style of the cover of the book, so I
wanted to do something inspired by that," Lubowich said.
From rendering to reality +
As the costumes and set are laid out, the props come in.
Elena Garcia, a junior in MT&D and LSA, was hired as co-
propsmaster for MUSKET's upcoming production of "Aida"
and immediately met with both the set designer and direc-
tor. Garcia's work is less about artistic creation and more
about realization of what the designers and directors want.
"It's their vision for the show that it's our job to make
happen in the way that is the most artistic and the most in
line with their vision that we can," she said of taking on
props.

EPISODE REVIEW

This week, "Glee" bounced back
from its "Rocky Horror" tribute
with an episode exploring sexual-
ity and returning
to the good old ***
days of boys vs.
girls mash-ups. Glee
In true season NeverBeen
one style, Kurt
(Chris Colfer) Kissed
doesn't pass up FOX
the chance to spy
on a rival glee club from an all-
boys academy, but stumbles upon
a friend, mentor and potential
boyfriend in the club's lead singer,
Blaine ('U' alum Darren Criss).
Criss's performance was the
highlight of the episode, with an
RTESY OFFOX all-male a cappella rendition of

Katy Perry's "Teenage Dream"
that will remain stuck in heads for
a while, along with his courageous
advice for Kurt.
"Never Been Kissed" stands
out in a truthfully rocky season.
Still, the episode contained only
four musical numbers, which is
too few for a show that people
watch mostly for song and dance.
It made these four numbers count
with a memorable hair band mash-
up from the glee club girls and a
tuxedo-clad girl-power mix from
the boys, and the a cappella num-
ber was a refreshing treat that the
show should take more advantage
of. More Darren Criss would be
much appreciated.

TRAILER REVIEW

cOURTESYoFWARNERBRO

Just when you thought it was
safe to join the boy scouts again,
along comes Jane Leslie Conly
with her psychological thriller
"Crazy Lady."
What started as a harmless
campout becomes a struggle
for survival when Loretta Von
Kidnapsalot sneaks up on Troop
666. Our protagonist Jimmy
Littlekid doesn't stand a chance,
it seems. But with a little help
from his Converse sneakers and
some flying flowers, he manages
to make a fight of it.
Conly's mastery of suspense
is most evident in this narra-
tive. The way Kidnapsalot's
stalk is portrayed truly evokes
the image of a dementor with a
fixation for gaudy hats and cos-
tume jewelry. And just when the
stakes get high, Conly provides

some comic relief to lighten the
mood in the form of Littlekid's
conveniently inconvenient flat-
ulence. No wonder he always
looks so embarrassed.
But the true pinnacle of the
story comes in a final battle.
Without giving too much away,
suffice it to say that you'll tip
your hat to that final battle
scene. Wait, no, you'll say, "Hats
off to that!" Wait, no, you'll put
on your thinking cap at the drop
of a hat to try to figure out this
clever tease at what the final
battle entails. ... ... They fight
with their hats. It's pretty epic.
Sorry, I couldn't resist giving
it away. But at least I didn't tell
you who wins.
Jimmy wins.
Fuck.

Finding comedy
at the bottom of a
magic wine bottle
By JOEY CADAGIN
DailyArts Writer
A magic potion that makes a
guy irresistible to women - it's the
dream of many an awkward suitor.
Like a lot of typi-
cal bachelors, the
leading man of The Elixir
Gaetano Doni- of Love
zetti's beloved
opera "The Elixir Tomorrow
of Love" finds at 7:30 p.m.,
his own "liquid Friday and
courage" in a Satudayat 8
cheap bottle of p.m., Sunday
red wine that at 2 p.m.
he's convinced Power Center
contains magic Tickets from $10
powers. The Uni-
versity Opera
Theatre will present a double-
casted production of this vivacious
work starting Thursday.
First premiered in 1832, "The
Elixir of Love" takes place in a
small town in rural Italy. The
main character, Nemorino, is a
kind yet naive country bumpkin
who falls in love with the beau-
tiful Adina. When Adina rejects
Nemoino's romantic advances,
he visits the traveling salesman
Dr. Dulcnamara and purchases

what he believes is an elixir of
love. In reality, the potion is a
cheap bottle of Bordeaux, and
Nemorino makes a drunken fool
of himself. After a series of lucky
coincidences and chance events,
however, Nemorino finally wins
Adina's heart.
"It's an absolutely charming and
spirited work, and that's what I
love about it," said director Joshua
Major, a clinical assistant profes-
sor of opera in the School of Music,
Theatre & Dance.
For this production, Major has
chosen to set the action in the
1950s, a change he hopes will bring
a fresh perspective to the work.
"I think the '50s capture the
spirit of the work, and it keeps
the work fresh," Major said. "it
enhances it and makes it fun.
There's an innocence that we proj-
ect on the period that works well
with this piece."
He went on to say that the
change in era does not interfere
with the opera's plot and that it
even allows for some exciting new
elements, such as an onstage pick-
up truck.
Major also has high praise for
the young and fresh-faced student
musicians with whom he has been
working as director.
"They're open, they're eager,
they have energy," he said. "They're
experiencing the joys of the work
process for the first time. I love
working with college students."

One of these young singers is
soprano Amy Petrongelli, a sec-
ond-year master's student in the
School of MT&D, who will portray
Adina at Thursday's and Satur-
day's performances. Last spring,
Petrongelli sang University Opera
Theatre's production of "Armide,"
but Adina is the soprano's first lead
role in Ann Arbor.
"She's a very headstrong
woman," Petrongelli said of her
character. "She knows exactly
what she wants, and she knows
how to get it, too.... And I appreci-
ate that in her. So many times (in
opera) you get lead women charac-
ters who aren't ready to stand their
ground."
In the tenor role of Nemorino on
Friday's and Sunday's performanc-
es is School of MT&D second-year
master's student Kyle Tomlin.
Tomlin, who has been preparing
for the opera since the summer,
said that it was daunting at first to
take on such an enormous role, but
he has now slipped comfortably
into his character.
"He's really genuine, and it's
really easy to relate to this guy,"
Tomlin said. "It's everything you
could ask for in a character: You
end up getting the girl and you get
to sing all the arias. ... You really
want to do this role, because it's
something that will come back for
sure throughout my career. So it
really pays to learn it now."

BEHIND THE SCENES
From Page 1B

Working with the set designer,
Garcia and her co-propsmaster
wrote out a "master props list" of
everything they'd need. From there,
gathering the props was mostly a
matter of trips to the Salvation Army,
Michael's and the Internet tofind the
items on the list. But props-collect-
ing is not a decision-free endeavor.
"There's a bunch of fruit that
makes several appearances
throughout the course of the show,"
Garcia explained, "and the fruit that
would have been common in ancient
Egypt is not necessarily going to)
read like decadent fruit to a modern
audience."
"They would have had pome-
granates and dates, things that
read as fruit, but they don't neces-
sarily make the same statement as
having a pile of grapes that someone
feeds someone else."
For McCulloch, bringing his
"Into the Woods" costume designs
to fruition also required some hunt-
ing around.
"The show's so specific, because
it's kind of a 'period-less wonder-
show,' " McCulloch said. Besides
creating 15 brand-new costumes, he
-rented, bought and altered existing
garments to match the details of his
"Into the Woods" renderings.
But, like any costume designer at
the 'U,' McCulloch began his search
by digging through the costume
stock on North Campus.
"Here at the University, we have
a really fantastic costume stock,"
Lubowich said. "(It's) sortedby time
period, by size, by color. So it's racks
and racks of suits, and dresses, and
there's, like, a 1920s aisle - so that's
the starting place."
"Within the shop, there's the
community," McCulloch explained.
"There's drapers who make the pat-
terns and there's stitchers who put
the things together, and those peo-
ple have been working together for
a long time; we have a holiday party
and all of that stuff."
It's a community that has nur-
tured both McCulloch and Lubo-
wich in the theater, and their
costume upbringing sometimes
spills over into other areas of their
work.
"Since I have this background in
costumes, I use a lot of fabric in my
set designs," Lubowich said. When
building the "Potter Sequel" set, he
decided to paint on a large sheet of
fabric instead of actually building
his book cover scene.
"When you hang it up and stretch
it tight, it looks like it's solid," he
said.
As a show's set materializes, its
lighting designs follow suit. For
"Pentecost," McCarthy photo-
graphed the set designer's "model
box" - a miniature construction
of the set - four times. Each photo
showed the same set at a differ-
ent point in the play, under specific
kinds and colors of light. One cov-
ered the scene in bright red, another
bathed it in white from a spotlight
emanating from a hole. McCar-
thy also mapped out a "light plot"

describing the type and location for
each light. All this work was duejust
a few weeks before his show moved
into the Arthur Miller Theatre.
"The director arranges all the
performers a certain way, but in a
rehearsal it can look one way, and
then with lights it changes totally."
he said. When a production moves
into the theater, the designers come
too for their last step.
The final product
The crew takes a day to nove
the set from the set shop to the the-
ater. For "The Elixir of Love," in the
Power Center, the set shop is right
downstairs, and for "Pentecost," in
the Arthur Miller Theatre, it's locat-
ed next door. Once all the pieces are
in the theater, designers can fiddle
with the small things - or in some
cases, alter more general aspects of
the design concept.
"Before we went into the the-
ater, the director and I talked, and
I'd gotten the sense that he want-
ed a more naturalistic approach,"
McCarthy said. "Then we got in the
theater and based on what he liked
... he was interested in a more paint-
erly quality to the lights."
At the time, McCarthy was
studying neoclassical French paint-
ing, and he incorporated that into
his revisions.
"(It) has a lot of color, strong angle
in the light and contrast, it's very
sculptural," he said. "I think that I
was more specific than the direc-
tor was thinking about (when lie
said) 'painterly,' but for me it really
helped translate what was going on,
and it lined up with what he meant,
so it worked really well."
After four days of tech rehears-
als with the set and lights in place,
the costume designer arrives to add
another piece to the puzzle, and
dress rehearsals begin.
The "Into the Woods" dress
rehearsals marked McCulloch's
chance to see his costumes under
the lights and decide if they needed
last-minute modifications. Ulti-
mately, he made some subtle chang-
es - like adding to the outfit of
Cinderella's Prince in order to mix
up the color-blocking.
"I wanted to break it up a little

more because lie was all red and
gold and then white pants, and so
I decided to add these little white
bows on his shoulders," McCulloch
said. "They were kind of froofy,
and when lie ran they kind of flew
behind him, so it added to his char-
acter."
once the curtain rises on open-
ing night, McCulloch, Lubowich,
McCarthy and Garcia can see their
finished product -- and so can the
public. in some cases, the design-
ers get feedback: Like its predeces-
sor, "Potter Sequel" went viral on
YouTube, and Lubowich wasn't
ismmune to the attention.
"It was iostly fanss (saying), 'It
looks just like the cover of the book,
was that an accident?' " he said.
"No,"'
But barring emergency repairs,
the designer can rest easy and watch
the onstage action from a padded
audience seat.
"A great part of being a designer
is once it opens, it's done," McCar-
thy said.
During a show's run, any glitches
in costumes, set and lighting will be
taken care of by backstage hands
like the wardrobe crew, run crew'
and deck electrician. And all of
these players work under the stage
manager, whose job won't be done
until the show closes.
"We've got actors and dancers
and musical theater msajors," Elias
said of the crew for "The Elixir of
Love." "They're the ones control-
ling it and they've never worked a
rail in their life."
Besides making sure all these
new-to-crew students know what
they're doing, Elias has been fol-
lowing the director and overseeing
all the coiplexities of the produc-
tioi, from design meetings'to audi-
tions to actor safety.
"I like the more organizational
side of it, and I get to play make
believe every day," she said.
Like many theater designers and
managers, Elias started her stage
life as an actor. But these artists all
found the dramsa behind the scenes
more engaging.
"Its a job where you are paid to
create fake worlds and entertain
people," she said, "and I don't have
to get onstage and do it."

was more likely to become the poet. If poetry allows
us access to capital-T Truth, it does it through the
sounds of language. But this doesn't mean we should
ignore whatever truths those sounds allow us. Auden
knew that too, and I think this knowledge was gnaw-
ing on him when he wrote these lines from "Septem-
ber 1,1939":
May I, composed like them
Of Eros and of dust,
Beleaguered by the same
Negation and despair,
Show an affirmingiflame.
Though it stares down the German invasion of
Poland and the inevitability of the Second World
War, the poem was circulated widely after the ter-
rorist attacks of Sep. 11, 2001. Its most famous line
- "We must love one another or die" - showed up
Providing a poetic
answer to my wise and
persuasive friend.
in one e-mail forward after another, though Auden
himself had struggled with the "truth" of the line.
He revised it obsessively, eventually cutting the
entire stanza, then disowning the whole poem for
being "dishonest."
But the poem had become necessary in a way art
rarely does. People had found comfort, however slight
or fleeting, in the words of this poem just when much
of the world seemed so suddenly unfamiliar and ter-
rible. While it has been omitted from many editions
of Auden's work, a poem people feel has laid claim on
truth - even if the poet doubts that claim - is not so
easily disowned. What was said could not be unsaid.
So the poem survives in anthologies and memories
and, in the autumn of 2001, in countless forwarded
emails.
Every cultural institution struggled to find what to
say that September. The first issue of The New Yorker
after the attacks included a single poem, by the Pol-
ish poet Adam Zagajewski, printed on the magazine's
last page. The poem must have been accepted by the
editors months earlier and was probably written and
translated years before that. Nevertheless, I cannot
imagine a work of art more relevant in that awful fog
that followed the 9/11 attacks, a poem to remind us
beautifully and without pretension how to live our
lives. To "Try to Praise the Mutilated World" (trans-

lated from the Polish by Clare Cavanagh):
Try to praise the mutilated world.
Remember June's long days,
and wild strawberries, drops of wine, the dew.
The nettles that methodically overgrew
the abandoned homesteads of exiles.
You must praise the mutilated world.
You watched the stylish yachts and ships;
one of them had a long trip ahead of it,
while salty oblivion awaited others.
You've seen the refugees heading nowhere,
you've heard the executioners sing joyfully.
You should praise the mutilated world.
Remember the moments when we were together
in a white room and the curtain fluttered.
Return in thought to the concert where music flared.
You gathered acorns in the park in autumn
and leaves eddied over the earth's scars.
Praise the mutilated world
and the gray feather a thrush lost,
and the gentle light that strays and vanishes
and returns.
Lower Manhattan lay in chaos and ruin, but even
this world, we are reminded - especially this world -
must nevertheless be praised.
of course, not everyone agrees that poetry reveals
truth, and by not everyone, I mean Plato. Before going
into business selling gently used clothingto teens and
20-somethings, Plato kept busy by expelling poets
from his Republic. Poets, by creating images of virtue,
lead people toward illusion instead of the truth. With-
out the allure of their language, poets "are like faces
which were never really beautiful, but only blooming;
and now the bloom of youth has passed away from
them."
That Plato uses the poetic device of the simile to
condemn poets is a note of irony I cannot resist men-
tioning. But Emily Dickinson has already answered
Plato far better than Iever could. If poetry diverts
us from the truth, it's only so that we getthere by the
scenic route. In other words, poetry tells the truth
slant. I doubt if anyone has ever told it more beauti-
fully than she:
#1129
Tell all the Truth but tell it slant-
Success in Circuit lies
Too bright for our infirm Delight
The Truth's superb surprise
As Lightningto the Children eased
With explanation kind
The Truth must dazzle gradually
Or every man be blind-
Dickinson and Plato both remind us that any truth
is always mixed up with the way it's told - which
is why Plato thoughtpoets so dangerous, and why I
think poems are so important. It's good to have a wise
and persuasive friend to remind you just how impor-
tant they are.

IASA: Bhangra, Bollywood and hip hop


Cultural show
celebrates its 23rd
year in style
By KAVI SHEKHARPANDEY
DailyFilmEditor
Now in its 23rd year, the exorbi-
tantly energetic, fiercely entertain-
ing cultural show
put on by the
Indian American Samiasti:
Student Associa- Elements
tion (IASA) ranks
among the most
iconic of Univer- Tomorrow
sity experiences, at 7 p.m.
Like painting Hill Auditorium
"The Rock" and Tickets from $12
attending a game
at the Big House,
watching the IASA show - the big-
gest student-run production in the
country, according to its coordina-
tors - should be an essential part of
the University curriculum.
The performance, boasting 250
participants this year, is an annual
showcase of Indian culture through
song and dance. Tomorrow's show,
titled "Samasti," is paired with the
thematically significant tagline
"Elements of Illusion."
"We wanted to portray how
the different styles and dances of
India represent the many cultures
in India and how they all come
together as one to form the overall
national identity," said Engineer-
ing senior Rohan Agarwal, the
show's co-coordinator alongside
LSA senior Nina Davuluri. "And we
thought that using elements kind of
as a metaphor would help describe
that whole process."
For the uninitiated, India is
about as culturally diverse as some
entire continents. The country has
more than 20 distinct regional lan-
guages, several major religions and
dozens upon dozens of unique eth-
nic groups. Native Hindi speakers
from Delhi could take a trip to the
southern state of Andhra Pradesh,
where the dominant language is
Telugu, and find themselves unable
to read signs or communicate with
the locals.
States in southern India even

According to the show coordinators, the IASA Cultural Show is the largest student-run production in the country.

tries with songs and styles very dis-
tinct from those of Bollywood, the
Hindi film industry based in Bom-
bay. Accordingly, the IASA show
includes a South Indian dance, fea-
turing songs from those industries.
Other dances drawn from specific
subcultures include Bhangra, a
dance native to the northern region
of Punjab, and Raas, a dance from
the region of Gujrat that uses sticks
called "dhandia" that the dancers
twirl and bang together.
"(Raas relies) heavily on forma-
tion - it's a very energetic dance
that requires precision," Agarwal
said. "It all depends on the partner
and the hitting of the dhandia. (The
dancers) are never still in dancing,
always moving from one formation
to another, or around their partner
and back and forth."
More returning favorites to
"Samasti" includethe sultry, seduc-
tive Gypsy dance; the Bollywood
dance, which uses popular songs
and dances from the Bombay film
industry; and Village, a traditional
dance that represents the customs
of rural India. The all-girl Classi-
cal dance, which is choreographed
with ancient Indian dances styles,
is also back. But this time, the
dance has been tweaked to make it
more accessible.
"In this year's Classical they

are blending more modern, main-
stream songs than just the classical
songs," Davuluri said. "There's a
Bollywood song in there and Amer-
ican songs in there, so it makes it
easier to interact with the audi-
ence."
"Samasti" features the addition
of two new dances, titled "Fusion"
and "Elements."
"The Elements dance was
sparked by the theme. ... People
wanted to do a fire-themed dance,
so we decided to turn it into to a
dance that would incorporate all
the elements, which worked out
really well," Davuluri said.
The dance features songs that
make reference to the four classical
elements: air, water, earth and fire.
Earth, for instance, is represented
by a thunderous bhangra dance and
fire by a passionate, highly viva-
cious routine.
Each dance is performed to a
medley of songs, and the choreog-
raphers of the brand-new Fusion
dance decided to mix up their
selection, choosing songs from
bhangra, Bollywood and American
hip hop. Fusion embodies the flat-
tening of the world and the subse-
quent blending of American and
Indian culture. The influence of the
West's cultural dominance has long
left a mark on India, but the past

few years have seen Indian culture
pervade into mainstream Ameri-
can culture like never before - just
look at "Slumdog Millionaire" and
"Outsourced," which regularly fea-
tures Bollywood music in its epi-
sodes.
"Kids these days over (in India)
don't just listen to Indian music or
American music, but kind of a mix
now," Davuluri said. "There are
also a lot of Indian people doing
hip hop, and there's a lot of remix-
es between Indian and American
songs."
The Fusion dance was actually
pitched to the show coordinators
by its choreographers, Engineering
junior Ankur Agrawal, Business
junior Divya Toshniwal and LSA
junior Sanjay Kataria.
"We like bhangra, Bollywood
and hip hop, and IASA didn't really
have any hip hop, so we thought it
would be cool to combine all three,"
Agrawal said.
"(We) are big Bollywood people
and we were on the Bhangra Team,
so we know a lot of those songs,"
Toshniwal said.
Agrawal, Toshniwal and Kataria
have been choreographing their
dance for months, song by song,
through a combination of free-
styling and planned moves. Their
dance is a true fusion - not only
do the song choices vary between
the three genres, but audiences
should plan to see unconventional
pairings of song and dance style:
for instance, a bhangra dance
style performed to a hip-hop
song and hip-hop dance moves

set to a Bollywood song. As for the
American selection, the choreog-
raphers promise the audience will
hear "That Girl" by Frankie J and
"A Milli" by Lil Wayne, along with
other surprises.
That exhaustive list of dances
has been in the works since the
beginning of the calendar year,
when Agarwal and Davuluri were
chosen by the IASA executive
board to be the coordinators for the
cultural show. After holding inter-
views, the duo then chose seven
IASA members to form the show's
core. These unsung heroes accom-
plish all the gritty work behind the
scenes to make the show a mon-
strous success.
Collectively, the group then
interviewed choreographers and
assigned them dances in the spring.
Then, in mid-September, dance
participants entered a lottery that
sorted them into their dances. This
year, the show received an incred-
ible 350 applications for the dances,
which had to be pared down to just
250.
Then began the intensive two-
month period during which the
time commitment to IASA expo-
nentially increases and anyone
with friends in the show starts to
think, "Why the hell are my IASA
friends so busy all the time?"
Until the night of the perfor-
mance, participants put in six to
nine hours a week, practicing their
dance moves into the wee hours
of the morning, with sprinkled-in
dress rehearsals and events build-
ing a tight community.

"We want there to be chemistr
in the dances so that they becom
a better product on stage," sai
show core member and Busines
sophomore Nikhil Kulkarni. "Bu
also this year, we wanted to tr
to emphasize one dance gettin
to know another dance. So tha
would mean they would go sho
each other each other's dances an
critique them, or by going to differ
ent IASA events, they get to mee
people outside and that just help,
everybody all around."
This two-month commitment i,
merely a supplement to the enor-
mous workload already bestowed
upon many University students
But all the time invested is abso
lutely crucial to the show's promi
nence.
"It's notjust students and friend
and family that go to the show,'
Agarwal said. "It's residents fro
Ann Arbor and southeast Michigan
that actually come to see a profes-
sional show put on by students."
"They don't look at it like a stu-
dent activity or anything, they
look at it as a legitimate show," he
continued. "So we have to make
sure we put on a professional show,
which means our choreographers
have to make really good dances,
and our dancers have to put in a
lot of practice so that they give off
the appearance that they are pro-
fessional dancers on stage - even
though a majority of them have
never danced before, or done any
sort of training in any of the dances
that we're teaching. So that's what
takes hours and hours for the past
two months to do."
This dedication to maximizing
the professionalism of the show
is what carries "Samasti" into the
upper echelon of great University
productions. And on top of all the
effort, the money earned from the
performance is going to charity. All
the proceeds from tickets are going
to OneWorld Health, a nonprofit
that develops inexpensive medi-
cine for people in the third world.
As demanding as the process can
be, the participants have an abso-
lute blast throughout the show.
"You learn how to do this dance
with a lot of other people, and it's
a good experience," said LSA junior
Akhil Kher, a first-time participant
in the Village dance who has been
waiting since he came to the Uni-
versity to have time to do the show.
"You have to put ina lot to the prac-
tices but even though it takes a lot
of your time it's definitely a lot of
fun."

"Out of the Through June 26

showcases
contemporary
woodturningworks alongside 19th-
and 20th-century folk art pieces.
The exhibition space is divided into
the Bohlen and Fusfeld collections,
both of which, according to Senior
Curator of Western Art Carole
McNamara, were donated before
UMMA's renovation and expan-
sion.
According to art history Ph.D.
student and guest co-curator Kris-
tine Ronan, the exhibition's title
reflects the collaborative vision of
co-curators Joseph Proctor (associ-
ate curator of modern and contem-
porary art), Ruth Slavin (UMMA
director of education) and McNa-
mara.
"Part of that title - for these par-
ticular collections especially - is
that these aren't the kinds of works
that are traditionally seen in a
museum," Ronan said. "Contempo-
rary woodturning art is a very new
collecting field, and it also has only
in the last five to 10 years actually
been in exhibitions and large muse-
ums, and so in that sense it's not the
ordinary museum show you would
potentially see. And American folk
art has a similar kind of story."
In woodturning, artists place
wood on a lathe - a machine that
spins material on an axis - and
use pressure to apply a tool (which
can range from a chisel to a chain-
