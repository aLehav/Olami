Texas congressman
receives 48 percent
of under-30 vote
By RAYZA GOLDSMITH
Daily News Editor
DES MOINES, Iowa - On
Tuesday night, Valley High
School senior Trey Herbert had
to detide between ttending his
school's football game or voting
in the Iowa caucuses.
He those the caucus.
"There's a big game today,but
I don't really care about it, so I'm
gonna go to (the caucus)," Her-
bert said.
Herbert was one of 800 stu-
dents at Valley High School
here to attend 'Rock the Cau-
cus,' a campaign event hosted
in the school's gymnasium, and
one of 18,000 Iowans under the
age of 30 to cast a vote in Tues-
day's caucuses, according to
the Center for Information and
Research on Civic Learning and
Engagement.
Herbert, who said it was dif-
ficult to choose between Rep.
Ron Paul (R-Texas) and former
House Speaker Newt Gingrich,

said he thought Paul could bet-
ter represent young people, but
he said he was unsure of what
Gingrich had to offer America's
youth.
The uncertainty in candidate
alignment appeared to be a com-
mon theme among other young
voters in
Iowa. Paul
received
from cau-
cus attend-
ees under
age 30, or
48 per-
cent of the youth demographic,
according to CIRCLE. One-third
of Paul's total vote came from
young people, and he has con-
sistently proven to be the most
popular Republican contender
among young voters despite
being the oldest candidate in the
race for the nomination.
At 'Rock the Caucus,' Paul
received the loudest applause
out of the three candidates who
spoke - Paul, Rep. Michele
Bachmann (R-Minn.) and for-
mer Pennsylvania Sen. Rick San-
torum.
Herbert said the enthusiasm

In study, 300
gallons of natural
water analyzed
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
For the past few months, an
unknowing student may have
been surprised to stumble upon
150 miniature rivers in the base-
ment of the Dana Building.
The experiment, known as
the "Flume Room," began in

late August and officially ended
on Dec. 24. Bradley Cardinale,
an assistant professor in the
School of Natural Resources
and Environment, oversaw the
experiment and said many tests
allowed his research team to
simulate environmental stress-
es on water quality and examine
many different variables that
affect watersheds.
"We've got invasive species,
we've got erosion, we've got
nutrient pollution, chemical
pollution, biodiversity loss, the
list goes on and on," Cardinale

said. "The goal of this project
is to figure out what are the
most pressing environmental
problems that are facing the
streams."
Caridinale said he and his sev-
en-person team took about 3,000
gallons of sediments and water
from the Huron River and circu-
lated the water in 150 containers.
To compare the effects of dif-
ferent hazards, they introduced
variables such as chemicals or
invasive species into separate
mini-streams. The group also
replicated incidents of erosion

and sedimentation in other
mini-streams. Each river's
health was assessed through its
water quality and ability to pro-
duce oxygen.
While the mini-rivers are not
currently running, Cardinale
said he doesn't expect data from
the experiments to be analyzed
until April.
Nonetheless, Cardinale said
some results could be visibly
observed. Mini-rivers that had
been treated with the herbi-
cide Roundup showed increased

University President Mary
Sue Coleman's Christmas letter
to President Barack Obama was
abitmore pointed than the aver-

Following the release of an
open letter to Obama lastmonth,
in which Coleman outlined sug-
gestions for making higher edu-

expressed appreciation for her
efforts. Though Occupy U-M

By BRANDON SHAW and
HALEY GLATHHORN
DailyStaffReporter
andDaily News Editor
Despite former Pennsyl-
vania Sen. Rick Santorum's
late surge to finish second
in Tuesday's Iowa caucuses,
President Barack Obama's
re-election campaign specifi-
cally attacked former Massa-
chusetts Gov. Mitt Romney,
who won the caucuses by
eight votes, in a conference
call with senior campaign
officials yesterday.
During the call, Obama's
national press secretary
Ben LaBolt, campaign man-
ager Jim Messina and chief
strategist David Axelrod

discussed Romney's slim vic-
tory, particularly focusing on
Romney's policyinconsisten-
cies and Obama's continuing
campaign efforts.
Axelrod addressed
Obama's campaign strategy
moving forward, frequently
criticizing former Romney's
varying stances on major
political issues. Ultimately,
he said Romney's wavering
positions would hurt him if
he enters the general election
as the Republican nominee.
"(He has) a huge credibil-
ity issue, which has created a
great deal of anxiety among
Americans, among even
his supporters last night,"
Axelrod said. "This is the
fundamental point. Taking
two positions on every issue
doesn't make you a centrist,
it makes you a charlatan - it
makes you unreliable."

New store to

By ANNA ROZENBERG
Daily StaffReporter
Food markets specializing in
organic and specialty foods on
campus have traditionally strug-

gled to compete with the low
prices at chain stores like Meijer
or Kroger, but a new student-
friendly co-op is attempting to
attract student customers.
The co-op - tentatively
titled the Ann Arbor Student
Food Co-op - is still in its plan-
ning stages and co-founder
Alex Green, a Business School
graduate student, said his goal
is to develop a store located

near campus that provides
both healthy food options and
employment opportunities for
students. Green said the co-op's
organizers are still unsure as to
when the store will open.
Green said while grocers like
the People's Food Co-op in Ker-

sustainable foods, he wants to

What classes are you teach-
ing right now, and which one is
your favorite?
I'm teaching Atmospheric
Thermodynamics and Engineer-
ing Design. I like both sections,
but this is the first time I'm
teaching Atmospheric Thermo-
dynamics.
You won the Arizona Gov-
ernor's Innovator of the Year
award in 2007 and 2008 for
helping the scientists who
found water on Mars. What
was it like to play a role in this
discovery?
It was completely unexpected.
I thought that it was possible, I

knew that because of my under-
standing of thermodynamics. No
one was thinking about that. The
goal of the Phoenix mission was
to go there and sample the ice,
not to look for water.
Your page on the College of
Engineering website includes
the quote, "The truth never
triumphs, their opponents
die." Why did you pick this
quote?
Because you make progress
in science. People think that
it's really straightforward, you
come up with a new theory and
everyone's going to accept it, but
people in all sciences have a lot
of baggage - they don't change

their mind very easily. The way
things change in science is by
new people coming into science
with new ideas, the newest idea
being better, and the old ones
changing their minds.
What's your favoritenmovie?
The Star Wars series.
How do you like the current
weather in Michigan?
More than Mars. I like the
change - today was a beautiful
day with some snow and some
sun. I wish the winter were a bit
shorter, I like the seasons.

he wanted to "liven up Japan"

The tuna was caught off Oma,

Bepablican Presidential candidate, former Utah ov. Jon Huntsman gestures daring a campaign stop in Manchester, N.H.
yesterday.
Huntsman: Republican race
is wide open in Iowa's wake


Candidate "smells
victory" despite
skipping Iowa
MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP)
- Former Utah Gov. Jon Hunts-
man rallied campaign volunteers
yesterday by saying he can smell
success in New Hampshire -
and by showing off his presiden-
tial campaign's first television
ad.
The ad features Huntsman
declaring, "We are getting
screwed as Americans." The
spot, which goes on to offer him
as a strong leader, will be airing
in New Hampshire ahead of the
state's Jan. 10 primary. The cam-
paign said the ad buy is at least
$100,000.
Previewing the ad at Hunts-
man's Manchester headquarters,
campaign manager Matt David
said the nation's first primary
will help Huntsman exceed
expectations here and in South
Carolina and push him onward
to Florida. David predicted
Florida will be a turning point in
Huntsman's campaign.
Huntsman, who skipped the

Iowa caucuses and is count-
ing on a strong showing in New
Hampshire to remain in the race,
spent Wednesday joining sign-
waving supporters in Concord
and speaking to workers at sev-
eral businesses. His audiences
at both were more polite than
enthusiastic, but Huntsman was
buoyant when surrounded by his
campaign volunteers.
"Ladies and gentlemen, I can
smell success," he said, then
added a new twist to his stan-
dard joke about a food item he
considers a New Hampshire
favorite. "I'm not going to say
it smells like a lobster roll, but I
can sense a little NH in it."
Earlier in the day, Huntsman
toured a company that makes
firefighting suits, where he tout-
ed one of his key endorsements
and dismissed front-runner Mitt
Romney's latest catch.
Joining Huntsman at Globe
Manufacturing was former
Homeland Security Secretary
Tom Ridge, who noticed the
Romney signs dotting the roads
and took issue with their slogan
"Believe in America."
"All Republican candidates,
and even President Obama,

believe in America," said Ridge,
a former Pennsylvania gover-
nor. "The question is, who do we
want to lead America? Who's the
principled leader we can trust?"
Though Huntsman was happy
to tout Ridge's endorsement,
he told reporters that "nobody
cares" about Sen. John McCain's
endorsement of Romney. Hunts-
man backed McCain's 2008 pres-
idential bid and campaigned for
him in New Hampshire in 2007.
"I have great regard for Sen.
McCain. I love the man. But it's
another example of the establish-
ment piling on. And it seems the
more the establishment 'piles on
- (Bob) Dole, McCain, all the rest
- nobody cares," Huntsman said.
"None of the endorsements
Romney's picked up have meant
a thing in terms of how people
respond, because people are
looking for a new generation of
leadership," he said.
Huntsman has been hop-
ing to follow in the footsteps of
McCain, who won the 2000 and
2008 New Hampshire primaries
after skipping Iowa's contest. He
calls himself the underdog and
insists that New Hampshire vot-
ers love underdogs.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
ACLU to challenge
domestic-partner
healthcare law
The American Civil Liberties
Union announced yesterday that
it will file a lawsuit to challenge a
new Michigan law that bans pub-
lic health insurance for domestic
partners of some government
employees.
The ACLU said it would discuss
the case at a news conference last
Thursday in Detroit. Republican
Gov. Rick Snyder signed the law
on Dec.22.
The ban mostly affects local
governments and public schools
and applies to health insurance
and other benefits for unmarried
partners of the employees, same
sex or not. The ACLU has called
the law "mean-spirited and cruel."

An Arizona sheriff whose office

part in discussions with federal
officials about ways to correct the
alleged violations.
Maricopa County Sheriff Joe
Arpaio said that his office first
needs the U.S. Justice Department
to provide facts to back up its alle-
gations that his office racially pro-
files Latinos, bases immigration
enforcement on racially charged
citizen complaints and punishes
Hispanic jail inmates for speaking
Spanish.
"I have a suspicion that politics
might be involved in this, but we
want to resolve (the case)," Arpaio
said.

Cuba criticizes
Twitter for rumor
of Castro's death
State media yesterday accused
the social networking site Twit-
ter of helping spread a rumor that
former Cuban leader Fidel Castro
had died, and criticized anti-Cas-
tro expatriates it dubbed "necro-
philiac counterrevolutionaries"
for jumping on the story.
An article on the state-run
Cubadebate Web site accused
Twitter of allowing an account
holder with the sign-on "Naroh"
to start the rumor on Monday
from an Italian server, possi-
bly after it was taken over by a
"robot." It says the account was
then quickly deactivated.
It said Twitter then helped
spread the disinformation by
allowing the hash tag "fidelcas-
tro" to become a trending topic.
It briefly became the fourth most
popular in the world as it drew
many more people to the subject.
The site also accused Twitter of
censoring subjects in the past that

were in favor of the Cuban govern-
ment.

Swiss central bank
defends president
amid controversy
Switzerland's central bank
sought yesterday to quash criti-
cism of its president by releasing
an independent auditors' report
which concluded that currency
deals from his private account
were "delicate" but did not break
the bank's internal guidelines.
The Swiss National Bank pub-
lished the report by auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers amid
growing pressure on bank chief
Philipp Hildebrand to reveal
details of the deals that saw his
family earn 75,000 Swiss francs
($83,000) from dollar currency
swaps at a time when his central
bank was acting to depress the
value of the Swiss franc.
The central bank also released
its previously secret guidelines
for senior officials and said Hil-
debrand would hold a news con-
ference Thursday.

Santorum hopes
to appeal to
conservative voters
MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -
Mitt Romney eagerly pocketed an
endorsement from two-time New
Hampshire primary winner John
McCain yesterday and bid to con-
vert a single-digit victory in Iowa
into a Republican presidentialcam-
paign juggernaut. Unimpressed,
Newt Gingrich ridiculed the for-
mer Massachusetts governor as a
liberal turned moderate now mas-
queradingas aconservative.
Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick
Santorum sought to rally conser-
vatives to his side after coming
achingly close to victory in Iowa,
saying he "hoped to surprise a
few people just like we did" in the
campaign's first contest.
"This is a wide-open race still,"
added former Utah Gov. Jon
Huntsman, who skipped the Iowa
caucuses in hopes of making his
mark in next Tuesday's first-in-
the-nation primary.
Romney is the odds-on favor-
ite to win the New Hampshire
primary, though, and it is unclear
how much campaign cash any of
his rivals has available to try to
slow or even stop his momentum.
Additionally, in a measure of his
establishment support, the former
governor announced he would
campaign with South Carolina
Gov. Nikki Haley on Thursday, as
he was joined by McCain in New
Hampshire.
"The time has arrived for
Republicans to choose a presi-
dential nominee, a new standard
bearer who has the ability and

determination to defeat President
Obama," said McCain, the 2008
Republican presidential nominee,
and a man with a demonstrated
appeal to the state's independent
voters.
Already, the Republican field of
challengers was dwindling.
Minnesota Rep. Michele Bach-
mann ended her campaign after a
dreary 5 percent showing in Iowa,
the state where she was born.
After suggesting he, too, might
withdraw, Texas Gov. Rick Perry
decided otherwise. "Here we
come, South Carolina!!!" he tweet-
ed. That primary is Jan. 21, and
will mark the first balloting in the
South as well as in a state that is
part ofthe Republican Party's con-
servative, political base nationally.
Iowa, for months ground zero
in the Republican race, yielded an
almost impossibly close finish.
Romney emerged with an
eight-vote victory over Santorum,
whose grass-roots campaigning
produced a late surge that fell just
shy of victory. Texas Rep. Ron
Paul finished third, followed by
Gingrich, Perry and Bachmann.
A survey of Iowa caucus-goers
highlighted the internal divisions
in the GOP as it sets out to find a
challenger for President Barack
Obama in the general election
campaign.
Romney, who campaigned as
the man best positioned to defeat
Obama, was the favorite by far
amongcaucus-goers who said that
goal was their priority. Paul was
preferred by those who said what
mattered most was backing a true
conservative. Santorum ran par-
ticularly well among those who
said they were looking for a candi-
date with strong moral character.

Suleiman said the decision

before the most violent day of
the 18-day uprising that forced
Mubarak to step down on Feb.

kill enough protesters to force
the rest to disperse.
Another prosecutor, Mustafa
Khater, told the court that spe-
cial police forces armed with
automatic rifles targeted the
heads, chests and eyes of pro-
testers.
The prosecution also showed
video of the violence taken
by TV stations. They showed
police officers loading up their
weapons with live ammuni-
tion and police and fire engine
trucks chasing protesters and
running them over. One video
showed a police officer perched
on top of a police car and killing
a protester with a gunshot to
the head.
"The defendants before you
in the cage are the actual insti-
gators and are the ones who
gave police officers the order to
shoot," said Suleiman. He also
said that the prosecution has
evidence that the regime used
"thugs" against the protesters.

Felix could face
up to 25 years in
prison
SAN DIEGO (AP) - Mexi-
can drug kingpin Benjamin
Arellano Felix pleaded guilty
yesterday to racketeering and
conspiracy to launder money,
avoiding the spectacle of a trial
for the leader of a cartel that
once smuggled hundreds of
tons of cocaine and marijuana
into the United States and dis-
solved bodies of its rivals in
vats of lye.
Under an agreement with
federal prosecutors, Arellano
Felix, 58, can be sentenced
to no more than 25 years in
prison - a lighter punishment
than ordered for lower-ranking
members of his once-mighty,
Tijuana-based cartel.
Prosecutors agreed to dis-
miss other charges that could
have brought 140 years in pris-
on if he was convicted.
The half-hour hearing was an
anticlimactic finish to the U.S.
government's pursuit of one of
the world's most powerful drug
bosses during the 1990s. His
cartel, with its iron-tight grip
on the drug trade along Cali-
fornia's border with Mexico,
was portrayed in the Steven
Soderbergh film "Traffic" but
has struggled in recent years as
other cartels have become more
ruthless than ever.
Laura Duffy, the U.S. attor-
ney in San Diego who built

much of her career on the case,
said Arellano Felix will likely
spend the rest of his life in U.S.
prison but did not elaborate on
the reasoning for the plea deal.
"Today's guilty plea marks
the end of his reign of murder,
mayhem and corruption, and
his historic admission of guilt
sends a clear message to the
Mexican cartel leaders operat-
ing today: The United States
will spare no effort to investi-
gate, extradite and prosecute
you for your criminal activi-
ties," Duffy said.
Arellano Felix stood atten-
tively in court, acknowledging
his guilt as U.S. District Judge
Larry Burns recited parts of
a 17-page plea agreement. He
told the judge that he has been
suffering migraine headaches
almost daily but that the prob-
lem didn't impair his judgment
to accept the plea agreement.
Anthony Colombo Jr., Arel-
lano Felix's attorney, said his
client could be released from
U.S. prison in 20 years if cred-
ited for time served in this
country and good behavior,
assuming he gets the maxi-
mum 25-year sentence. As a
Mexican citizen, he would then
be deported to Mexico, where
he still has nine years left on a
sentence for related crimes.
Colombo said the govern-
ment may have agreed to the
deal to avoid having to bargain
with 21 potential government
witnesses for reduced sen-
tences in exchange for their
testimony. They also may have

wanted to avoid a lengthy trial.
"They have to consider years
and years of litigation, plus the
expense, is avoided by this res-
olution," Colombo told report-
ers.
John Kirby, a former fed-
eral prosecutor who co-wrote
the 2003 indictment against
Arellano Felix, said the case
rested entirely on cooperating
witnesses, instead of wiretaps
or physical evidence. He said
those cases weaken over time
as witnesses die, get into more
trouble or change their minds
about testifying.
"This kind of case is based
solely on witness testimony,
and it slowly disintegrates,"
Kirby said. "Maybe from the
time when we put it together
and now, it's not such a great
case anymore."
The cost of a trial was
unlikely to have influenced
prosecutors, Kirby said.
"The government doesn't
care about the expense, the
government cares about win-
ning," he said.
Francisco Javier Arellano
Felix, a younger brother who
led the cartel after Benjamin
was arrested in Mexico in
2002, was sentenced in San
Diego to life in prison in 2007,
a year after he was captured
by U.S. authorities in interna-
tional waters off Mexico's Baja
California coast. Jesus Labra
Aviles, a lieutenant under Ben-
jamin Arellano Felix, was sen-
tenced in San Diego to 40 years
in prison in 2010.

OccUpV real ideas
Congress should enhance campaign finance laws
When the Occupy protests began in September in New York
City, the grassroots movement against corporate greed
and rising income inequality seemed poised to become a
liberal equivalent to the Tea Party. Critics noted the movement's lack
of central leadership, organization and a legitimate political agenda.
Months after spreading from Wall Street to cities and college campus-
es worldwide, the mostly peaceful protests have fallen from the media
spotlight. As 2012 begins, Occupy supporters are still looking for tan-
gible results. But the movement may be able to turn to Congress for
action, as a Constitutional amendment has been proposed to limit the
influence of corporations. Congress should pass the proposed amend-
ments introduced in the spirit of Occupy and work toward limiting

underneath their skis. Over time,
gravity pulls more and more skiers
into the same waves, which become
carved into the landscape. Small hills
form around the paths where the
snow remains untouched. Without
conscious intention, the process con-
tinues until the hill becomes a mogul
field - small, white islands in a lat-
tice of riverbeds.
Moguls are hard to ski. They
require quick knees and more than
a bit of tenacity. From the chairlifts,
watching unskilled skiers tumble in
them is a pastime for all.
Caucuses have a bit in com-
mon with mogul fields - they're an
antique pattern states have fallen
into. The meetings to pick presiden-
tial nominees are supposed to be
used as times for grassroots dialogue
and debate before each individual
votes. Caucuses are usually reserved
for experts, but they each have a sig-
nificant population that thinks being
headstrong is enough to take them
on.
On Tuesday, I attended a caucus
at Drake University in Des Moines,
Iowa hoping for some students to talk
to. Not surprisingly, there weren't
many in the crowd of about 200
because they're still on break.
The frenzyofa nonstop press cycle
fooled me into believing the caucuses

themselves are exciting. I thought
the buildup would culminate in intel-
ligent debate from Iowans. While sit-
ting behind the red rope separating
observers from caucus-goers, I real-
ized how wrong I was.
It began a little after 7 p.m. The
caucus chair, a Drake sophomore,
asked for nominees to speak on
behalf ofreach candidate. Speakers
representing former Massachusetts
Gov. Mitt Romney, former Pennsyl-
vania Sen. Rick Santorum, Rep. Ron
Paul (R-Texas) and former House
Speaker Newt Gingrich emerged. of
those who spoke, only the Gingrich
and Paul representatives seemed
prepared - the woman caucusingfor
Romney admitted she hadn't planned
on being the speaker that evening.
A bowl was passed up and down
the rows filled with votes written on
slips of paper. The caucus organiz-
ers took the makeshift ballots to a
corner and counted. An older orga-
nizer accidentally announced inac-
curate resultsbefore the caucus chair
stopped him.
The real results were announced,
and within minutes the room was
down to about twenty people in
seats and a handful more trapped in
the room by pouncing reporters. My
watch read 7:45.
There was no debate. Not a word
about Rep. Michelle Bachmann (R-
Minn.), Texas Gov. Rick Perry or for-
mer Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman. Their
fewsupporters at the Drake were left
without any voice in the proceedings.
Those who did speak didn't even use
all of their five-minute slots and had
little substance or hard facts on their
candidate's platform. There was
no chance that predecided voters
heard anything to change their vote.
More importantly, undecided voters
weren't given convincing arguments
to choose a candidate. And isn't that
the whole point?
For a country obsessed with elec-

tronic and manual election fraud,
caucus-goers are given a lot of trust.
Anyone could have dropped in more
than one paper slip. The count took
place in the corner by people who
had just declared their allegiance to
a candidate. There are no recounts in
the Iowa caucuses - what happens,
happens.
Those I spoke to at the Drake
caucus said how great caucuses are
because voters get to mingle and
talk to each other. The press loves
that story. It's part of the caucuses'
charm. I'm not sure, however, what
they were referring to besides the
speakers.
Primaries are
less quaint, but
better for voters.
Yes, it was quaint, personal and
definitely grassroots. But, the pro-
ceedings were unprofessional and,
more importantly, not educational
for voters.
Caucuses exclude voters who aren't
available at a certain time instead of
the relative freedom of primary elec-
tions. The early Iowa caucus excludes
students and those serving overseas.
A study from the University of Texas
concluded caucuses do worse than
primaries in ensuring proper demo-
graphic representation.
The anecdotal continuance of
caucuses isn't beneficial to voters -
that's why a majority of states have
gotten rid of them. We've acciden-
tally builtthem into mogul fields, and
each year we pound the snow down
tighter.

corporations' political influence.
In homage to too-long acronyms, Rep.
Ted Deutch (D-Fla.) introduced the Outlaw-
ing Corporate Cash Undermining the Pub-
lic Interest in our Elections and Democracy
Amendment on Nov. 18. The amendment is
one of several proposals aiming to reverse the
Supreme Court's opinion in Citizens United
v. Federal Election Commission, which ruled
that the First Amendment protects political
donations by corporations as a form of free
speech. The Citizens United decision forbade
the government from limiting political dona-
tions by corporations.
Though American democracy is far from
ideal, ashortage of corporate dollars is notpart
of the problem. Despite former Massachusetts
Gov. Mitt Romney's August statement that
"corporations are people," U.S. citizenship
should not be diluted to include for-profit cor-
porations. Corporations are set up within the
bounds of written law and should be regulated
as such.
Businesspeople can and should promote
their business interests by donating to cam-
paigns and political action committees.
Allowing corporations unlimited campaign
spending, however, enhances businesses' abil-
ity to influence political campaigns. Corpora-
tions should not be able to use profitsto support
or oppose candidates or legislative initiatives.
The OCCUPIED Amendment states that
"the rights of natural persons ... do not extend
to for-profit corporations." The amendment

would disallow the unlimited corporate
spending that has flooded elections since the
landmark Citizens decision in January 2010.
Corporations' political influence should be
subject to government regulation, and this
amendment reaffirms that.
Regulation guaranteeing that donors and
candidates maintain transparency in cam-
paign expenditures is vital. Non-stop elec-
tion cycles have created a never-ending need
for campaign contributions, which can lead
to clientelism that harms true representative
democracy. The amendment, along with sim-
ilar legislation introduced in the Senate, is an
important step toward returning the control
of government to living, breathing citizens
instead of resource-rich corporations.
National, city and campus officials have
spent significant energy containing the
Occupy movement's momentum. Police pep-
per-spraying peaceful protesters on the Uni-
versity of California-Davis campus displays
these efforts at their worst. Occupy's message
that the widening income gap is harmful to
democracy has started important conversa-
tions worldwide. It has direct implications for
students - President Barack Obama widen-
ing federal student loan forgiveness is one of
the few tangible results of the movement. The
OCCUPIED Amendment should move for-
ward through Congress, and dialogue about
negative implications of income inequality
and corporate influence should continue.

Perfecting our elections

PATRICK MAILLET I
Kim Jong Un's North Korea

While many students were in the basement
of the Shapiro Undergraduate Library strung
out on caffeine cramming for finals or already
home for the holidays, a major event in world
politics occurred that could have detrimental
effects on the United States. On Dec. 19, North
Korean state media announced that Supreme
Leader Kim Jong Il had died after ruling for
17 years. Through absolute dominance of state
media, military, government and nearly every
other facet of North Korean society, Kim
thought of himself himself as a divine leader
who treated his country and his people with
great morality. Call it brainwashed, call it fear-
induced loyalty or call it whatever you'd like -
the people of North Korea viewed their leader
as a god. But what happens when a god dies?
Throughout winter break, the world
watched North Korea mourn its fallen leader
with spectacular parades and other - some-
times bizarre - displays. We watched count-
less North Koreans sobbing in the streets over
Kim Jong Il's death. And soon after he passed,
the North Korean government declared Kim's
son, Kim Jong Un, the country's new leader.
Every worldwide media outlet scrambled in an
effort to find out who this 20-something real-
ly is. Most sources don't even know when or
where he was born, and usually report his age
as "28 or 29." We don't know exactly who the
heir is, what his intentions are or how North
Korea will change under his leadership. We do
know, however, that like his father, Kir Jong
Un will be very unpredictable.
Perhaps the most unpredictable element of
this new leader is whether he will be able to
lead at all. Considering his young age and inex-
perience, it's unclear whether military leaders
will respect Kim Jong Un's power. According
to a 2010 article in The Guardian, some of the
military elite were noticeably upset when Kim
Jong Un was appointed by his father as a 4-star
general in 2012 though he hasn't served a single
day in the military.
The military could possibly see the new
leader as a threat to their power and stage a
coup. This option could result in violence,
intervention from China or many other plau-

sible scenarios - including South Korean
involvement. The possibility that Kim Jong
Un fears his ability to rule is being questioned
not only by North Koreans, but also the entire
world. In a rash, desperate maneuver to earn
respect, he could act with catastrophic con-
sequences. Considering that this young - and
possibly reckless - new leader commands a 1.2
million-troop army, and is likely in control of
a nuclear arsenal, this possibility is incredibly
frightening.
About one month prior to Kim Jong Il's
death, President Obama announced the
deployment of 2,500 marines in Darwin, Aus-
tralia where they will further support our
nation in the Asia-Pacific region, as reported by
The Telegraph. Few deny that this was a proac-
tive military move in preparation for possible
conflict with China. Beijing immediately made
their discontent with the deployment public,
and insisted that America was inappropriately
involved in foreign territories. Unfortunately
for both China and the U.S., North Korea's
recent shift in power could put these Marines
in action much sooner than anyone imagined.
China's alliance with North Korea and the
United States' with South Korea could poten-
tially have disastrous effects throughout the
Asia-Pacific region. If North Korea - led by
Kim Jong Un or another military leader - was
to attack South Korea or Japan, the U.S. would
have little choice but to begin military engage-
ment against North Korea. Similarly, if North
Korea got involved in a war against the U.S.,
China would have little choice but to support
their ally.
While this World War III scenario may seem
oversimplified, it is terrifyingly realistic.
As America continues to pull its troops out
of the Middle East, be prepared for their pos-
sible relocation. Unfortunately, this change in
power could have massive global reverbera-
tions. For now, we can only sit back and watch
with unease as North Korea adjusts to its shift
in leadership.

M ost Republicans with
whom I have discussed
the Republican primaries
say they would
like anybody
but former Mas-
sachusetts Gov.
Mitt Romney to
be the Repub-
lican nominee. '
But with so
many other can-
didates splitting MATTHEW
the vote, Rom- ZABKA
ney narrowly
won the Iowa
caucuses and seems poised to walk
away with the nomination. Assum-
ing most Republicans have this "any-
body but Romney" attitude, it seems
unfair that he should represent the
Republican Party in the general
election. This raises the question
of whether different voting sys-
tems exist that would better reflect
Republican - and more generally
society's - preferences.
In a ranked voting system, voters
rank candidates in order of prefer-
ence. The voting system then tells
us society's preferences. Note that
the plurality rules voting system by
which Michigan elects its officials
is a ranked voting system: Voters
rank candidates (in their heads)
and then vote for their first choice.
Plurality rules tells us that the can-
didate with the most first choice
votes is society's preference.
For example, suppose Charlie,
Snoopy and Woodstock run for gov-
ernor of Michigan. In the election,
Charlie receives 40 percent of the
vote, Snoopy receives 35 percent of
the vote, and Woodstock receives 25
percent of the vote. Using a plurality
rules voting system, Charlie would
win the election.
But what if every person who
voted for Woodstock preferred
Snoopy over Charlie? That is 60 per-
cent of voters who would rather have
Snoopy as governor than Charlie.
But Charlie won the election. There
would seem to be a problem with this
voting system.

A runoff voting system, in which
more than one round of voting can
take place to find a winner, seeks
to rectify this problem by choosing
society's preference in a different
way. For example, in Louisiana's
gubernatorial elections, if no candi-
date receives more than 50 percent
of the vote in the first round of vot-
ing, a second round of voting is held
between the two candidates who
received the most votes in the first
round. The candidate who wins the
second round is elected governor.
Another example of a runoff sys-
tem follows: In each round, the can-
didate with the fewest number of
votes is eliminated. The next round
of voting has only candidates who
were not previously eliminated.
Rounds of voting continue until a
candidate receives more than half
of the vote, and this candidate wins
the election. This runoff system
is used for city elections in Min-
nesota's Twin Cities and Duluth.
Ann Arbor also used it for its may-
oral election in 1975. Using either
of these runoff systems, Snoopy
would win the above election.
Readers may now ask: What is
the best voting system, and why
isn't it used in all elections? Before
answering the question, one must
first define what "best" means.
Mathematicians say a perfect vot-
ing system must have the following
three properties: First, there is no
dictator. That is, there is no voter
whose vote completely determines
the outcome of the election. Second,
if a majority of voters prefer candi-
date X over candidate Y, then the
voting system should tell us society
prefers candidate X over candidate
Y. Third, the voting system is inde-
pendent of irrelevant alternatives.
This means that if the majority of
voters prefer candidate X over can-
didate Y and voters change their
preferences for other candidates A,
B, C without changing their prefer-
ences for X over Y, then the voting
system still tells us society prefers
X over Y.
We've seen above that the plu-

rality rules system fails the sec-
ond property, so it is not a perfect
voting system. But what about the
two runoff systems? They also fail
the second property, so these run-
off systems aren't perfect either. In
fact, the mathematical economist
Kenneth Arrow proved in his Ph.D.
thesis the amazing 'result that, as
long as more than two candidates
run in an election, one can find a
problem with whatever voting sys-
tem is used. No perfect voting sys-
tem exists. Both a plurality rules
system and the runoff systems have
their merits and problems.
An ideal
voting system
doesn't exist..
I hope readers walk away with
two thoughts after reading this col-
umn. First, many questions - espe-
cially in public policy - often have
no perfect solution. Competing solu-
tions can be suggested and it may be
that neither is wrong. This is a theme
I hope to explore in my remaining
columns - disagreement and debate
on such issues should be expected
and encouraged. It might sound pow-
erful when a politician labels his or
her opponent's position as "simply
wrong," but without further infor-
mation and a competing position,
intelligent citizens should . ignore
such empty rhetoric.
Second, mathematicians often
work on and find answers to very
interesting questions that, one
would think, have nothing to do
with mathematics. Question: Does a
perfect voting system exist? Math's
answer: No. You'll never invent one.
Stop looking.
Isn't that neat?

drew attention to the state of
Michigan - where Romney's
father served as governor in the
1960s - by mentioning Rom-
ney's controversial decision to
withdraw his support for gov-
ernment aid in the bailout of the
Detroit auto industry in 2008.
"Mitt Romney has a lot of
explaining to do in Michigan,"
Axelrod said. "He let Detroit go
bankrupt. The President took a
different view, which was that
we shouldn't cavalierly dismiss
the auto industry. Romney is
going to try and seize on the fact
that he's from Michigan, but
the question is whether he's for
Michigan."
Axelrod added that he
believes Romney is misguided
in his belief that productivity
can be equated with financial
stability in his economic policy
stances.
"(Romney) talks about a meri-
tocracy, but what he means is
that if you have all the advan-
tages, you should have all the
advantages and everyone else
should be left to fend for them-
selves," Axelrod said.
Messina echoed Axelrod's
sentiments and said Obama's
campaigning leading up to the
caucuses was reminiscent of the

"ground-up" movement built by
Obama's campaign in 2007 and

he has proven time and time
again (that) he's (going to) say
whatever he wants."
Levine, who has been cam-
paigning for Paul for a few
months, said he also believes
Paul could be viable in the gen-
eral election.
"I think he could blow Obama
out of the water," he said.
When deciding who to sup-
port, Valley High School senior
Clara Shoemaker said she seeks
candidates that share similar
values to her, particularly in
regard to religion.
"What I look for is people who
have the same beliefs as me,"
Shoemaker said. "My faith is
really important to me, so I'm not
for abortion, and then Republi-
can views (are also important to
me.)"
While young voters in Iowa
hold varying values and come
from a variety of backgrounds,
they seemed to hold one prin-
effects to other things we care
about," Cardinale said. "We will
not know until the data is ana-
lyzed."
Cardinale said environmen-
tal studies scientists have com-
monly believed testing Roundup
was ineffective, but his study
may disprove the idea. Scientists
have also previouslythought that
the active compound in Roundup
would break down easily, but he
said the increased algae growth
may suggest otherwise.
Thus far, the study's findings
apply strictly to the Huron River,
but Cardinale plans to test other
rivers in Michigan this summer.
Cardinale cited the Rouge
River in metro Detroit as a body
of water that is similarly in need
of environmental improvement,
adding that the Huron River is
2008. He added that the Obama
campaign is attemptingto recre-
ate its past success by mimicking
previous tactics.
"(The campaign) has con-
tinued to reach out to voters
through cafes and coffee shops,
just like the caucuses in 2008,
building from the ground up,
despite our running uncontest-
ed," Messina said.
Obama ran unopposed in this
year's Democratic caucuses and
secured a victory with 98 per-
cent of the vote, according to the
Iowa Democratic Party.
Thus far, Obama's campaign
has held 1,435 training and plan-
ning sessions, house parties and
phone banks, according to Mes-
sina.
Sixty two field team leaders
were sent to Michigan, and 71
were sent to Colorado, both of
which are battleground states in
2012, Messina said.
Despite the Obama cam-
paign's attention to Romney's
platforms, University Political
Science Prof. Vincent Hutchings
said in an interview before the
caucuses that policy may not be
the most important issue to vot-
ers. *
"(The caucuses) appear to
have generated into kind of a
popularity contest based on
perceived personality traits,"
Hutchings said. "The voters
don't appear to be primarily

focusing on the policy implica-
tions of their choices."

ciple in common - a belief in
the importance of voting among
America's youth.
"I think it's good just to be
responsible and to be involved in
the process," Hall said. "In the
last election, we saw what a lot of
young people could do in really
rallying behind Barack Obama
and really, you know, helping
him surge to the nomination ... so
I think that young people have a
huge part."
Levine agreed, addingthat the
United States is at a critical point
in its history, making it critical
for young people to get involved
if they want a say in where the
country goes.
"We're really at a point where
you have two options: You can go
down the same path or you can
switch gears," Levine said. "And
if students don't realize that, and
they don't get involved ... you're
not (going to) have the same
country we have now."
healthier because it is aided by
extensive bidiversiy and con-
tains healthy levels ofynutrients.
"The goal ultimately is to build
on our case study of the Huron
River to include pretty much all
the watersheds in Michigan that
would be flowing into the Great
Lakes."
Cardinale, who previously
lived in California, sampled riv-
ers in Los Angeles and through-
out southern California before
comingto the University.
He said syringes, body parts
and other medical waste in some
California rivers required him to
get vaccinations before testing
them.
"(It's) unbelievable in a devel-
oped country thatyou have to get
vaccinations before you go into a
stream," he said.
Axelrod said Romney entered
and emerged from Tuesday's
contest as a "kind of weak front
runner," due to his unstable lead.
Amanda Caldwell, chair of the
University's chapter of College
Democrats, said in an interview
before the caucuses that all of
the candidates appear toube lack-
ing strong support, which she
said was evident during events
leading up to the caucuses.
"They don't have a candidate
who a lot of people are getting
behind, who's getting a lot of
movement," Caldwell said.
Though Axelrod only dis-
cussed his thoughts on Romney,
he said the president's campaign
is prepared to face any nominee,
regardless of whether or not
Romney proves victorious.
Looking forward, Brian Kozi-
ara, external vice-chair of the
University's chapter of College
Republicans, said Romney could
strengthen his campaign in New
Hampshire if he emphasizes his
economic experience.
"I think it all comes down
to the candidate's background
and experience," Koziara said.
"Romney is seen as more adept
when it comes to the economy.
He's able to handle economic
issues a lot more easily and he
has more widespread appeal to
most independents."

Mount Rainier National Park
to re-open after ranger death

Memorial service
to be held next
Thesday
SEATTLE (AP) - Mount
Rainier National Park will
reopen to the public on Satur-
day, nearly a week after a park
ranger was shot to death trying
to stop a vehicle inside the park.
A public memorial service
has been scheduled Tuesday at
a Tacoma university for Mar-
garet Anderson, a 34-year-old
mother of two who was married
to another park ranger.
Anderson had set up a road-
block on New Year's Day to stop
a vehicle that blew through a
checkpoint that Mount Rain-
ier rangers use to determine
whether vehicles are equipped
with chains for winter driving.

The driver of that vehicle shot
Anderson in her car and fled on
foot.
Searchers found the body of
the suspect, Benjamin Colton
Barnes, in a snowy creek Mon-
day with a handgun and rifle
nearby. An autopsy showed he
had hypothermia and drowned.
Police say Barnes, a 24-year-
old Iraq war veteran, had been
involved in an earlier shooting
at a party early on New Year's
Day in Skyway, south of Seattle.
Both shootings were under
investigation Wednesday.
The family of Barnes extend-
ed condolences and asked for
privacy in a statement published
by The Seattle Times.
"Please know that our
thoughts and prayers are with
you and your families as well
during this difficult time,"
the statement said. "We are as

shocked as anyone concerning
the events of the last few days
and while we in no way condone
or excuse Ben's behavior, he was
a beloved member of our fam-
ily and we are saddened by his
loss."
Mount Rainier National Park
receives 1.5 million visitors each
year. In a statement, the park
said that all services would be
available Saturday except for
snow play.
An incident management
team brought in by the Nation-
al Park Service was helping
plan the memorial service for
Anderson, who had worked at
Mount Rainier for three years.
She is survived by her husband
and two young daughters. The
memorial will be at 1 p.m. Tues-
day at Pacific Lutheran Univer-
sity, park spokeswoman Patti
Wold said.


LETTER
From Page 1A
In the letter, Coleman dis-
cussed four ways to keep higher
education affordable and acces-
sible for more American fami-
lies, including an increase in
private donations to universi-
ties, increased partnerships
with private businesses, greater
philanthropic donations and
further budget restraints at the
institutions.
"Higher education is a pub-
lic good currently lacking pub-
lic support," Coleman wrote.
"There is no stronger trigger for
rising costs at public universities
and colleges than declining state
support."
White House Director of
Social Media Shin Inouye wrote
in a Dec. 28 statement to The
Michigan Daily that the Obama
administration "appreciates"
Coleman's commitment to the
issue and will continue to work
with university presidents in the
future to manage costs.
"The President and his
administration have already
taken many steps to make col-
lege more affordable, including
acting to reduce monthly pay-
ments for students, double fund-
ing for Pell grants and creating a
$2,500 tax credit to help pay for
school," Inouye wrote.
Coleman also wrote in the let-
ter that the state cut 15 percent
of the University's funding last

year-amounting to a 30-per-
cent reduction over the last
decade. She added that the cuts
are not unique to Michigan, and
that many public universities
and colleges across the country
share similar problems.
Specifically, she noted how
underfunding of the higher edu-
cation system in California has
led to the rapid "dismantling" of
institutions admired around the
world.
The University has tried to
follow the principles outlined
in Coleman's letter in recent
years, University spokesman
Rick Fitzgerald said in a Dec.
22 interview. He added that the
University has tried to shield
student costs as much as pos-
sible in the face of budget cuts.
"The University has a com-
mitment to increase financial
aid by at least the same per-
centage that tuition increased,"
Fitzgerald said. "In six of the
last seven years, financial aid
has increased at 10 percent or
more. In this year's budget, cen-
trally awarded financial aid was
budgeted at $137 million, which
was a record amount."
Fitzgerald added that Cole-
man, who also serves as presi-
dent of the Association of
American Universities, sent the
letter to Obama in mid-Decem-
ber because she was unable to
attend a meeting of university
presidents hosted at the White
House earlier in the month.
Art & Design senior Ian

Matchett, spokesman for occu-
py U-M, said he views the let-
ter as a valid start, but doesn't
agree with all of Coleman's
positions.
Specifically, Matchett said
he believes Coleman's goal of
increased state funding is the
most effective way of maintain-
ing college affordability, add-
ing some of the other goals are
unhelpful or even antithetical to
Occupy U-M's beliefs.
"Philanthropy is something
that is nice - it happens, but you
can't build a policy around the
sporadic goodwill of a minority
class," Matchett said. "You have
to build a policy that's sustain-
able, whether Bill Gates feels
like giving you a million dollars
this year or not."
To showcase its feelings on
the issue, last month, the Occu-
py U-M movement protested
against tuition costs atthe Board
of Regents meeting.
While Matchett said he sup-
ports University interaction
with businesses, he also believes
that the state should increase
funding with tax revenue gener-
ated from businesses, whether
or not the businesses directly
benefit from such partnerships.
"You can't have a business
only pay for public education
when it benefits (the business)
specifically or (when) it sees a
direct personal benefit from it,"
Matchett said. "Businesses are
benefiting from a socially-creat-
ed wealth."

Libyan military aims to
protect desert borders


Mangoush makes
disarming former
rebels top priority
TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) - Lib-
ya's new military chief of staff
said yesterday his first missions
are to protect the desert nation's
vast borders and help disarm
thousands of former rebels who
took part in the overthrow of
longtime leader Moammar Gad-
hafi.
Speaking to reporters in the
capital, Tripoli, Gen. Youssef
Mangoush said the country's
fledgling military faces huge
obstacles, including rebuilding
its bases and purchasing new
equipment.
"Many of the military com-
pounds are partially or totally
damaged, most of the gear and

equipment is destroyed and the
army before the revolution was
neglected by the old regime," he
said.
One of the most serious and
immediate problems facing
the interim leaders is disband-
ing disparate armed groups
of former revolutionary fight-
ers, divided among the regions
where the operate. The regional
militias, which played a main
role in bringing Gadhafi down,
are in charge of security in their
areas in the absence of a strong
and unified national military
force. Clashes are frequent.
Fierce gunbattles between the
militias erupted this week in the
center of Tripoli, leaving at least
four fighters dead.
Mangoush said unifying the
militias is a top priority.
"We hope to integrate the
rebels and have life go back to

normal, and keep things under
control," Mangoushsaid. He said
that in the first phase of recruit-
ment, some 25,000 soldiers will
be trained.
"Our long term plans are to
build a modern army," he said.
The Libyan military, still
recruiting fighters and under-
going an overhaul, has also yet
to establish itself as the central
authority on the ground.
Mangoush said that brigades
that once protected Gadhafi,
who was captured and killed in
October, are still armed.
Mangoush was once a spe-
cial forces commander under
Gadhafi, but he resigned from
the military 10 years before the
uprising. He joined with the
opposition in its battle to over-
throw Gadhafi's regime shortly
after protests erupted in Febru-

CO-OP

centrally located to campus.
The planning committee for the
co-op is currently looking at
property in the South University
Ave. area, as well as the former
Border's property on East Lib-
erty Street, Green said.
A major initiative of the co-op
is to develop a place where stu-
dents can be educated about
local food sources, while learn-
ing more about choosing healthy
food options, Green said. Ulti-
mately he said he hopes that the
co-op will become an educa-
tional tool for students, since the
University doesn't have a large
agricultural program like Michi-
gan State University.
"Michigan has had a need for

a large-scale food program,"
Green said.
Green said the group has also
received help from organiza-
tions that have expressed inter-
est in collaborating with the
initiative to brainstorm ideas on
how to start the co-op.
Yoni Landau, co-founder of
the Cooperative Food Empow-
erment Directive - an organi-
zation that helps establish food
co-ops on college campuses -
said his group helped the Ann
Arbor Student Food Co-op get
off the ground.
"We've just started support-
ing their young endeavor and
they're doing great," Landau
said.
Landau said CoFED, a recent-
ly developed company, wishes to
create a formal membership sys-
tem in which co-ops like the Ann

Arbor Student Food Co-op work
collaboratively with its organi-
zation.
LSA senior Ellyn Guttman
said she usually shops at markets
away from campus because she
has a car.
"I don't think there are very
many options on campus and I
think it tends to be a little pric-
ier," Guttman said. "You usually
can't get everything you need."
Guttman added that it is often
difficult for students without
cars to obtain fresh meat and pro-
duce, and she said she believes
the new co-op would provide a
more convenient option.
"I like to get fresh fish, fresh
meat," Guttman said. "I think
for people who don't have cars,
a co-op can provide food to kids
who are on campus ... it would be
extremely beneficial."

Explosions in Baghdad kill
six, wound at least 16 others

Bombs detotonated
30 minutes apart at
bus stop, tea shop
BAGHDAD (AP) - Two
explosions in a Shiite neighbor-
hood of eastern Baghdad killed
six people and wounded at least
16 others today, Iraqi officials
said.
In the first and largest attack,
police officials say a motorbike
bomb went off near a bus stop
where day laborers gather look-
ing for work in the Sadr city
neighborhood, killing six people
and wounding10.
The explosion took place
while some of the workers were
having their breakfast sand-
wiches and tea and others where
trying to board a minibus, offi-
cials said.

Half an hour later, a roadside
bomb exploded near a small tea
shop in the same neighborhood,
wounding six people.
Medical officials at nearby
hospitals confirmed the casual-
ties. The officials spoke on con-
dition of anonymity because
they were not authorized to
release the information.
Iraqi leaders have warned of
a resurgence of Sunni and Shi-
ite militants and an increase in
violence following the U.S. troop
withdrawal, which was complet-
ed last month.
The early morning blasts fol-
lowed a series of deadly attacks
yesterday that targeted the
homes of police officers and a
member of a government-allied
militia. Those attacks, in the cit-
ies of Baqouba and Abu Ghraib
outside Baghdad, killed four
people, including two children,

officials said.
The latest violence comes as
Iraqi politicians remain dead-
locked in a festering political
crisis that threatens to re-ignite
simmering sectarian tensions in
the country.
Prime Minister Nouri al-
Maliki's government, dominated
by Iraq's majority Shiites, issued
an arrest warrant for the coun-
try's top Sunni politician last
month.
The Sunni official, Vice Presi-
dent Tariq al-Hashemi, is cur-
rently holed up in Iraq's Kurdish
north - effectively out of reach
of state security forces.
Al-Maliki's main political
rival, the Sunni-backed Iraqiya
bloc, is boycotting parliament
sessions and Cabinet meetings to
protest what they say are efforts
by the governmentto consolidate
power and marginalize them.

Finland grants transit permit for

Lack of support
in Iowa cited as
cause of campaign's
termination
DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -
Minnesota Rep. Michele Bach-
mann said yesterday she's ending
her bid for the Republicans presi-
dential nomination after her
last-place finish in Iowa's leadoff
precinct caucuses.
"The people of Iowa spoke with
a very clear voice, so I decided
to stand aside," Bachmann said
at an emotional news confer-
ence, flanked by her family, hours
after the caucus results were
announced. "I have no regrets,
none whatsoever. We never com-
promised our principles."
The conservative Minnesota
congresswoman's decision, widely
expected following her dismal
Iowa showing, leaves her support-
ers up for grabs by the other can-
didates in the race and could be
a boost for former Sen. Rick San-
torum. Santorum narrowly lost

the caucuses to front-runner Mitt
Romney and is trying to emerge
as the clear conservative alterna-
tive to the former Massachusetts
governor.
Bachmann's decision gives San-
torum a clear shot at consolidating
the conservative vote heading into
the next round of contests, though
former House speaker Newt Gin-
grich and Texas Gov. Rick Perry
still draw support from that pool.
Bachmann, 55, had told a small
group of supporters Tuesday
night that she was staying in the
race as the only true conservative
who can defeat President Barack
Obama.
But hours later, she announced
her departure from the race, cap-
ping a deep and long slide for a
candidate who entered the cam-
paign last summer with very high
expectations.
There was great excitement
among Republican activists when
she began her campaign and she
translated that into a solid win in
the Iowa straw poll.
But as the campaign moved for-
ward, Bachmann ran into a series
of organizational and financial

hurdles. She had a big shake-up in
her campaign staff, with key back-
ers leaving to join Ron Paul's cam-
paign, and her fundraising trailed
virtually all of her rivals. That
slide was capped Tuesday night
with her sixth-place showing in
the leadoff precinct caucuses.
Bachmann did not take ques-
tions after her announcement nor
did she talk about her future plans,
including whether she would
endorse another Republican for
the presidential nomination or
seek re-election to Congress.
"I look forward to the next
chapter in God's plan," Bachmann
said. "I'm grateful to have been a
part of this presidential contest."
Her campaign manager, Keith
Nahigian, told The Associated
Press, that Bachmann has "no
time frame or person" in mind for
an endorsement.
She blamed her demise on her
straight-shooting, uncompromis-
ing approach to the issues. She
campaigned as a hard-liner on
social issues like abortion and gay
rights, as well as arguing for a
massive shrinking of the federal
government.

Authorities found
surface-to-air
missiles, explosives
on ship last month
HELSINKI (AP) - The
Finnish government yesterday
authorized the transport of 69
impounded Patriot missiles en
route to South Korea from Ger-
many on a British-registered
cargo boat.
The M/S Thor Liberty, which
arrived in Finland last month
from Germany to load a ship-
ment of anchor chains and paper
machine parts for China, was

held in port after authorities dis-
covered the surface-to-air mis-
siles and 160 tons of explosive
picric acid.
Police impounded the cargo
and launched an investigation
after port handlers reported
that the explosives, also headed
for China, were inadequately
packed and that the missiles did
not have the required transit
documents.
Government officials yester-
day said they had studied the
case and decided to grant the
Korean Defense Acquisition
Program Administration a re-
export license. It has until the
end of August to ship the mis-
siles from Finland.

"There was no reason to delay
anymore," Finnish Defense Min-
ister Stefan Wallin said. "Every-
thing is in order."
Earlier, the German Defense
Ministry said the cargo of mis-
siles was an official shipment
that was fully declared and had
all necessary clearings from
German authorities.
Also, Finnish officials have
said that the picric acid could be
shipped once it is safely packed.
However, despite the govern-
ment decision yesterday it was
not clear when the boat would be
able to sail pending the outcome
of the police investigation. Police
declined comment on the inves-
tigation.

Michigan looks to slow down
resurgent Hoosiers on road

Blue drops tenth

day night to
square off
with the 12th-ranked Hoosiers,
who opened their season with
12 straight wins before drop-
ping their first game of the sea-
son last week at Michigan State.
Indiana's success is no fluke
either, which the team proved
when it knocked off then-No. 1
Kentucky on Dec. 10 and then
toppled then-No. 2 Ohio State
on New Year's Eve.
Significantly, both of those
upsets were home games for
the Hoosiers - Assembly Hall
is notorious for being one of the
most difficult road environments
in college basketball.
"(Assembly Hall) holds a lot of
people," said sophomore guard
Tim Hardaway Jr. "And a lot
of people are down your neck
every time you're shooting. It's
going to be very hostile, like last
year when we went there. We're
used to it now. ... You've just got
to block everything out and just
focus on what (Michigan coach
John Beilein) wants you to do out
there."
The Wolverines have been
particularly susceptible to the
horrors of the building. Last sea-
son, Michigan (2-0 Big Ten, 12-2
overall) got blown out in Bloom-
ington, 80-61, by an Indiana
team that ended up finishing last
in the Big Ten.
And three seasons ago, when
the Wolverines made the NCAA
Tournament for the first time
under Beilein, they had to claw
their way back from a 20-point
deficit to defeat the Hoosiers in
* overtime. That team went just
6-25 for the season.
But for all the unique chal-
lenges that Assembly Hall poses,
playing on the road in general is
tough for any team, particularly
in the Big Ten. And in its only
true road game of the season so
far, Michigan played poorly in a
disjointed 12-point loss to Vir-

EAST LANSING - The Michi-
gan women's basketball team
struggled_
to find MICHIGAN 55
its stroke MSU 60
early and
often in Wednesday's game
against Michigan State, but a
3-pointer from junior guard
Jenny Ryan turned the tide for
the Wolverines, giving them a
27-24 halftime lead.
Michigan coach Kevin Borseth
wished the game could've ended
there, which would've ended his
team's nine-game losing skid to
its in-state rival.
But thanks to a one-two punch
early in the second half from their
pair of post players - redshirt
senior Lykendra Johnson and
freshman Jasmine Hines - the
Spartans went on to win, 60-55.
The two combined for a total of
18 points, puttinga passive Michi-
gan back line in atight space.
"You got a choice - you have
to play those big kids in front
or behind, and when we played
behind, they buried us," Borseth
said. "When they buried us, they
would just turn and score. We
struggled to get in front, found
ourselves on the side of them and
they used their leverage against
us."
The Wolverines (1-1 Big Ten,
12-3 overall) made a few in-game
adjustments to try and subdue the
duo - everything from a double-
down to a three-two zone - but
they could not be stopped. Strong
pins led to easy lay-ins and com-
plete control of the weak-side
glass, two things Michigan des-
perately needed to hold on to its
first-half momentum.
To compound an already-
gloomv situation for the Wol-

verines, the changes ended up
exposing two new weaknesses in
Michigan's defense - poor rota-
tion to the corners and trouble
gettingthrough screens.
Though Michigan State (2-0,
10-5) didn't have a very impres-
sive nightfrombeyondthe arc,the
wide-open looks created through
screens and ball movement led to
Michigan scrambling defensively,
resultinginevenmoreopportuni-
ties for the Spartans to score.
"We addressed Michigan
State's tendency to screen on the
ball before the game, but it was
an area we did not execute well,"
Borseth said. "They were getting
the high-low every time, and that
really hurt us."
Aside from the tough defen-
sive match-ups, the Wolverines
proved early on that they were
capable of competing offensively
with their in-state rival.
Junior center Rachel Sheffer
led the charge with 20 points,
including a 3-of-5 performance
from beyond the 3-point line.
Senior guard Courtney Boylan
added 11 points and Ryan finished
with eight.Borseth pinpointed his
team's loss to a lack of offensive
production during a three-minute
stretch of the second half.
"In that stretch in the middle
of the second half, we didn't know
what we were doing offensively
and it cost us the game," Borseth
said. "If we were able to answer
or have some fluidity, I believe it
would have been a different out-
come."
The game marked the 10th
straight loss for Michigan against
the Spartans. Though the game
will fall in the "L" column for the
Wolverines, Sheffer remarked
that there is a lesson to this loss,
in particular, that Michigan is
sure to carry with it for the rest of
the season.

Senior guard Zack Novak returns to his home state when Michigan travels to Indiana.

ginia on Nov. 29.
"Road games, they're tough,"
Beilein said. "There is an ele-
ment there. You've really got to
play well. You can't have an off
game and win on the road very
often. As a result, you've really
got to have a special day to (win),
and it's hard to do that in those
atmospheres.
"If we don't (win), we learn
from it, we get better for the next
time. We do (win), we learn from
that, and try to do it again."
Perhaps the most surprising
thing about the Hoosiers' turn
around is that, for the most part,
it's the same group of players
that scuffled all season long last
year.
That's except for one notable
addition. Indiana (1-1 Big Ten,
13-1 overall) is led by freshman
sensation Cody Zeller, who paces
the team in both scoring (14.2
points per game) and rebounding
(6.7 per game).
The center was a five-star
recruit, rated No. 15 in the coun-
try by Rivals.com. Zeller was
expected to provide an early
boost, but so far he has exceeded
even what Hoosiers headman
Tom Crean could have antici-
pated.
Zeller's emergence is particu-
larly troublesome for the Wol-

verines, who are still thin on
the interior with the continued
absence of sophomore forward
Jon Horford due to the stress
fracture in his foot.
So far, redshirt sophomore
forward Jordan Morgan has
done a solid job of keeping out
of foul trouble in Big Ten play.
He'll have to maintain that trend
against Indiana for Michigan to
have success.
"(Zeller)'s really a tremendous
player," Beilein said. "He can
pass, he rebounds, he's tough.
He's been a big difference maker
in their team from last year....
Maybe in the past, when they
threw it in (the post), you didn't
have to worry about a scorer in
there.
"They have a scorer in there
right now in the post."
But Beilein was quick to
point out that the Hoosiers are
far from a one-man show. Indi-
ana has four other players that
average double figures in points
(though one of them, forward
Will Sheehey, likelywon'tplay on
Thursday night due to alingering
injury in his lower left leg).
In fact, Crean's squad has been
nearly unstoppable on offense
this season, tied for eighth in
the country in scoring with 82.6
points per game. The Hoosiers

have been particularly lethal
from deep, ranking second in the
nation with a 44.7 3-point shoot-
ing percentage.
Forward Christian Watford
- who hit the game-winning
3-pointer over Kentucky - and
guard Jordan Hulls are both
shooting 50 percent or higher
from long range, as is bench play-
er Matt Roth.
Beilein noted Michigan itself
will have to play well offen-
sively to limit Indiana's attack,
so that the Hoosiers can't take
advantage of misses and get out
quickly on the break. Beilein
also said that there have been
stretches in recent games where
he's been very pleased with the
Wolverines' defense, but that
they haven't put it all together
yet.
Against Indiana, Michigan
may need a standout defensive
performance to steal one on the
road.
"We pride ourselves on play-
ing some defense," said senior
guard Zack Novak. "We know
they're going to score and go on
runs. There's going to be times
when we'll probably have to
push the pace a little bit, and
score and keep up with them.
But we're going to try to slow
them down a little bit."

Moffatt reshaped into two-way player for 'M'

ByMATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Editor
The admissions are tough. The
grading is harsh. The esteemed
professor meticulously molds his
pupils.
The Red Berenson School for
Two-Way Forwards is an Ivy
League-caliber institution. And
the Michigan coach has gained a
* reputation for developing some of
the most intelligent forwards in
the sport, or "complete players" as
Berenson puts it.
Sophomore forward Luke Mof-
fatt has earned his fair share of
gold stars this season. Berenson
sees him as one of the more dedi-
cated skaters on the team.
"He's always been a hard work-
er," Berenson said. "You couldn't
work harder than Moffatt."
Freshman forward Zach
Hyman added: "He's one of the
hardest working guys on the
team."
But Moffatt hasn't always been
the type of forward that best fits
in the program. In fact, he was a
very raw talent coming in - he
possessed mediocre skating skills
but was brilliant with the stick.
"He's had a lot to learn like
all other young, good players,"
Berenson said. "I think Moffatt
is much improved this year. He's
getting more confidence with
the puck and (is) working harder
without the puck. He's bought
into it, he's trying and he's doing a
much better job."

And far more often than not,
it's what players do without the
puck that determines games,
something Berenson constantly
stresses. He has team meetings
about how to play good, two-way
hockey. He sifts through game
tapes looking for examples of
when the Wolverines skated well
without the puck - or when they
didn't. When they did, chances
are that senior captain Luke Glen-
dening was instrumental.
Glendening and his fellow
seniors take the responsibility of
adapting their own playing style
to the system and then teaching it
to younger players. Their efforts
have had a clear influence on Mof-
fatt.
"(Playing both ways is) some-
thing I've been working on since I
got here," he said. "It's just being
more defensively reliable and
knowing my positioning."
Watch him this weekend at
Yost Ice Arena, even when he
doesn't have the puck. Moffatt
has learned from two-way players
like Glendening, and he in turn is
expected to help out the newest
players to the program - mostly
his linemates, freshmen forwards
Hyman and Andrew Sinelli.
"On the backcheck, (Moffatt)
comes back really hard," Hyman
said, noting that those are quali-
ties he loves to see in a linemate.
"He's a great two-way player."
But the most encouraging part
about Moffatt's recent surge -
he's scored twice in the last three

---OOI

games - is that he's an extremely
adept scorer, too. That's what
caught Berenson's eye when he
first observed the Arizonan's raw
talent. Though Moffatt has just
four goals this season, they've
all been timely - each has been
scored with the game in a tie or
one-goal differential. He has ten
points with an impressive six
plus-minus rating.
"He's always been an offensive-
minded player," Berenson said.
"That's one of the hardest things
for a good offensive player, to
learn how to work hard without
the puck."
And what should the Wolver-
ines do when they aren't skating
with the puck?

"You better play your posi-
tion and get (the puck) out of the
zone," Berenson said. "You bet-
ter back-check. You better watch
your man. You better play the
game."
Moffatt knows how important
this two-way style of play is to
Berenson.
And if his fellow players don't
buy into it quickly like he did, they
won't see the ice.
"If you're not playing both ways
... you're not going to be playing,"
Moffatt said. "You're going to
be practicing. That's one of the
things that's just absolutely man-
datory if you want to play."
Sounds like someone wants to
be a straight "A" student.

Spartans pull away late against 'M,'
take advantage of sloppy turnovers

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Writer
EAST LANSING - When it
comesto playing rivalry games,
records don't seem to matter.
Boasting its best start in pro-
gram history, the Michigan
women's basketball team came
into the Breslin Center hop-
ing to extend its record to an
impressive 13-2.
But Michigan State and its 9-5
record - regarded as an under-
achievement compared to past
seasons - wasn't going to win
on talent alone like in years past.
"You can't
afford not to be
tough in a game
like this."
So the Spartans stole it for
themselves.
Michigan State went on a 10-2
run to go up by 4 with 13:33 left
in the game, while Michigan
broke down offensively.
The Wolverines committed
four turnovers in the four-min-
ute stretch and came up empty
from behind the three-point
line, giving the Spartans all the
momentum they needed to win
the game.
To Michigan coach Kevin
Borseth, that sequence was the
game's deciding factor.
"We turned the ball over and
they hit shots," Borseth said.
"That was the game.
That was the whole game,
that stretch right there.

outcome.
"We turned the ball over,
they came back with a couple of
shots and I thought that was the
swaying difference."
The Wolverines' struggles
during those four minutes con-
tinued for the rest of the second
half.
Michigan committed 12 turn-
overs, reading to 15 Michigan
State points.
Though the Spartans had
more turnovers, recording 18,
the Wolverines struggled to
convert their opportunities into
points and momentum.
Michigan shot just 38 per-
cent from the floor, and junior
forward Rachel Sheffer was the

only Wolverine with a hot hand.
Sheffer scored a game-high
20 points, while senior guard
Courtney Boylan added 11.
Michigan's bench was nowhere
to be found, scoring just 14
points - the Spartan substitutes
scored 25.
Michigan State's size advan-
tage in the post gave the Wolver-
ines some issues as well. Sheffer
was in foul trouble for most of
the game, while her backups -
redshirt sophomore forward
Kendra Seto and junior for-
ward Sam Arnold - struggled to
match up against the Spartans'
stronger, tougher interior play-
ers.
"You can't afford not to be

tough in a game like this, espe-
cially when you're going to the
basket," Borseth said. "We had a
lot of opportunities down inside
that lane."
Michigan State's dominance
inside wasn't obvious from the
final points-in-the-paint totals
- Michigan was outscored by
just six points, 30-24.
But all night long, the Spar-
tans dominated the boards,
winning the rebounding battle,
44-29.
The Wolverines were espe-
cially hurt by Michigan State's
second-chance opportunities.
The Spartans pulled down 14
offensive rebounds, leading to
10 points.

course records in multiple con-
tests.
Freshman Richard Funk
claimed victories in both the
50-meter backstroke and 100-
meter backstroke at Jacobs
Aquatic Center on Tuesday.
The Ortiz brothers, freshman
Bruno and junior Miguel, had
impressive showings, as the
two paired with junior Roman
Willets to finished the 200-
meter medley with a time of
1:14.32.
They day ended with a
50-meter freestyle victory by
junior Evan Gregg with a time
of 23.25.
"What makes those wins hap-
pens is details," said Michigan
coach Mike Bottom. "Finishes,
breakouts, lane placement -
these are the things that are
tough to practice."
Set approximately halfway
through the season, the Orange
Bowl Classic signifies the begin-
ning of Michigan's postseason
run. When they return to Ann
Arbor, the Wolverines will face
a tough Indiana team at home on
Saturday.

"Alot ofthese guysget totrain

As far as goals for the season,
Bottom would like to see the
team win the remainder of its
dual meets and then battle for
a Big Ten Championship once
again.
"We were successful two of
the last three years," Bottom
said. "I can promise we'll be
there to fight for it."
Michigan will meet the Hoo-
siers at Canham Natatorium
for their second meeting this
season. Michigan won the first
meet, 216-84, on Nov.5.

The ostentatious, Rolly-on-my-arm, Bentleys-and-broads rap - ubiq-

separates Jay and Ye from the other McMillionaire clowns is the scope and
vision that propelled them to their Beyonce-shaped winner's circle in the

Throughout their careers, Ye-Z have succeeded by eschewing rap stereo-
types rather than attachingspace-shuttle-sized engines to the back of them
and blasting that shit into outer space.
Watch the Throne is no different. Ye-Z plant their Yves Saint Laurent flag
everywhere, conquering foes like dubstep, Lex Luger and Frank Ocean with
German shepherd snarls and Genghis Khan cries. And they probably aren't

Best TV Shows
1. Game of Thrones
In its heyday, HBO created programs that transcended genres and
offered something for everyone. With "Game of Thrones," HBO has
worked its magic again, turning George R.R. Martin's fantasy saga into a
refreshingly audacious program with incredible mass appeal.
The show's set in a world where seasons last for years and dragons
used to fly around. But that's largely ignored. Instead, HBO presents a
delightfully dark tale full of political and military intrigue. Armies move
at the behest of lords manipulated by seemingly minor players, such as
Littlefinger and the Imp - Tyrion Lannister - who truly run the show.
Illusions of chivalry and grace are shattered by pragmatism and horror.
Elaborate plots and wry wit are a credit to the writers room. The cin-
ematography and production design are a testament to HBO's attitude of
"Budget? Psh, we can pay for it with Skinemax." And of course, there's
that final, shockingbeheading.

1. Drive
A guy supplements his income by getaway driving for the Los Angeles
underworld and becomes trapped between the mafia and the woman he
loves. It sounds utterly conventional, yet somehow, "Drive" defies expec-
tations, an example of everything Hollywood's missing.
Director Nicolas Winding Refn's masterpiece is more arthouse than
blockbuster, but it isn't the arrogant wish-fulfillment of "Midnight in
Paris," nor is it Terrence Malick's, "I studied philosophy at Harvard"
brand of condescension. Refn takes us back to a time when filmmakers
cared about how their films looked, designing the composition of each
frame, each action set piece, each incredibly choreographed outburst of
white-hot violence, with meticulous detail. With the help of lead actor
Ryan Gosling, who turns in his best performance, Refn's filnmreinvigo-
rates the crime-action genre, breathing new life into a tired field.

4. Harry Potter and the Deathly
Hallows: Part 2

5. Midnight in Paris

When director David Yates joined the "Harry
Potter" franchise, he was under a lot of pressure.
The series was four movies and three directors in,
with notoriously expectant fans. But Yates rose to
the challenge, culminating in a dark finale more
rewardingthanthis year's alleged Oscar contenders.
"Harry Potter" is a fantasy bildungsroman: a
coming-of-age story for the characters, the film-
makers and us. "Deathly Hallows: Part 2" boasts
some of the best ensemble acting of the series, rely-

Best Albums of 2011

2. The Black Keys
- El Camino
The boys have done it again. El Camino, the lat-
est album from bluesy-rock duo The Black Keys,
sounds pretty much like the rest of their six
albums - and for that, you may thank them.
Hardly pausing to catch a breath after 2010's
bold and brazen Brothers, the band's El Camino is a
loud and crunchy riff-ridden album that continues
to satisfy.
El Camino revs up with the single "Lonely Boy,"
a tireless hymn about - what else is new - love
and loneliness. The album combines the noise and
grit of the boys with melodic chiming and a few
la's and whoa's of a chorus - few surprises, but
endless delights.
It's difficult to have too strong of a reaction to
El Camino. It isn't groundbreaking, but it is clas-
sic Black Keys. Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney
have been at it for a decade now, and don't worry
- they know what they're doing.
-KATIE STEEN

FOSTERTHEPEOPLE
COLUM B A
3. Foster the
People - Torches
It's hard to believe Foster the People just
released Torches last spring. In just seven months,
the album has soared to the top of pop and rock
charts and the group has accumulated a variety of
music award nominations.
But there's a reason for all the hype - Torches
has enough electrifying synth lines and static-y
vocals to nourish the hippest Urban Outfitters
playlist.
While it may be tempting to get caught up in
the hit single "Pumped Up Kicks," the rest of the
album is just as tantalizing. Each track stands out
from the others with its own catchy twist. It's live-
ly and unpredictable while still sounding polished
and cohesive: There is never a boring beat, yet
nothing sounds out of place. And to think - this
is only Foster the People's first shot at releasing an
album.

4. The Roots -
Undun,
Young men dealt an impossible hand in drug-
worn, forgotten neighborhoods aren't exactly few
and far between in hip hop. But The Roots manage
to bring an old theme back to life - a plaintively
melodic, literally backwards life - on Undun, the
group's second album since shacking up with Jimmy
Fallon's show. Nothing makes protagonist Redford
Stevens (musically related to Sufjan, whose song
"Redford" makes an appearance) unusual, which is
precisely what makes the album out of the ordinary.
Undun is the concept-album version of "The
Wire," a hard look at reality on the streets, as Red-
ford's story is traced from death to birth in the pres-
ent tense. The album highlights Roots ringleaders
"?uestlove" and Black Thought in equal parts: The
former funneling soul, classical and indie harmonies
into his gently rolling downtempo journey, the latter
poignantly recalling a narrative he grew up along-
side - a narrative that could have been his.

5. Cut Copy -
Zonoscope
At times, dance records can be annoyingly
functional, made solely with the intent of being
played at a club or party.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, bands
like LCD Soundsystem and Hot Chip have cre-
ated a whole new genre of ironic dance tracks
with snarky and sarcastic lyrics as easily enjoyed
on personal headphones as they are pumping
through loud speakers.
Cut Copy straddles this line as well as any band.
Neither planting its tongue too firmly in its cheek,
nor blindly escaping to a DJ booth, the Australian
quartet have been refining their craft for eight
years now, and Zonoscope - the band's third effort
- is hands down its finest to date.
Zonoscope is a truly versatile album with slight
hints of wit sprinkled across shameless dance
tracks, making it an appropriate selection for
many occasions.

Best TV Shows of 2011

NBC

2. Parks and Recreation

3. Community

The greatest thing about NBC's "Parks and Recre-
ation" is how easy it is to adore every character. And
now, "Parks" has become one of the most beloved TV
comedies.
Season four represents what "Parks" is all about.
The relationship between Ben and Leslie gets direct
attention. It's refreshing to see them face the music
and answer for the office romance instead of finding
some sitcomm-y loophole.
And how on earth can we pick the finest hour of

Ron Swanson? Maybe it's when he gives his Paw-
nee Rangers a handbook with just one instruction:
Be a man. Maybe it's when his mustache "falls off"
courtesy of Tammy One, or when he throws away
the invasive and satanic device, AKA his computer.
Whatever it is, the man can do no wrong.
The fact that "Parks" has yet to win any big-name
awards is shameful. Still, it has cemented itself a
place with the comedy greats of our time.
-PROMA KHOSLA

2011 has been rough for cult hit "Community,"
which is on indefinite hiatus. But creatively, the
show has been brilliant.
While the first half of the second season was a
little uneven, the part that aired in 2011 was insane
in the way only "Community" can be. The Christ-
mas claymation psychodrama in 2010 led into a
sequence of episodes in which the show's self-
aware mode of joke-telling supplemented the deep
characterization and became a part of it.

The best episodes of "Community" are gimmick
episodes: a bottle episode that calls itself a bottle
episode and episodes with multiple timelines. But
what "Community" does with these gimmicks is
more than just clever. The show's tricks help us
understand the characters and has become excel-
lent at balancing sharp writing, clever references
and character moments. Treasure it while it's still
here, because "Community" might not last long.
-SAM CENZHANG

4.Breaking Bad

5. Downton Abbey

Having concluded its heartstoppingly suspenseful
fourth season, "Breaking Bad" has evolved from its
"Weeds"-esque premise into something utterly differ-
ent: A life-or-death competition full of shock value and
brutality, an elaborate chess game tempered by guns,
organizedcrime and of course, methamphetamine.
Walt's struggle with his drug-lord boss Gus comes
to a head. After Walt packs yet another victim of
Gus's pragmatic, throat-opening rage into a barrel
of acid, the writing's on the wall - Walt's a dead

man. As Walt plots his survival, and ostensibly, that
of his loyal underling Jesse, Gus runs into his own
problems - the Mexican Cartel is hijacking his ship-
ments and daringto declare war.
The pressure exerted on all parties slowly comes to
a boil until it finally explodes, literally, in the season
finale. For the moment, the formerly benign Walt, as
he says, "is the danger." Whether he maintains this
status as the show continues is a different story.
-DAVID TAO

"Downton Abbey" is the runaway hit of the
year. The lavish series proves that a period piece
can still kick ass. Produced by the BBC, each epi-
sode is soap-y, yet totally refined.
The series has managed to mix delectably dishy
drama with an in-depth look at the English class
system. It provokes real intellectual effort while
sparking up deadly arcs and delicious intrigue. It
follows the twists of the well-off Crawley fam-
ily and their considerably less well-off servants.

The first season starts off after the sinking of the
Titanic, exploring the ins-and-outs of the caste
system and rules of society.
The drama is a resounding achievement as the
most successful British costume drama in almost
30 years. Collecting a bundle of awards for its first
season, including several primetime Emmys, the
series doesn't appear to be slowing down anytime
soon. Bring on the fancy hats!

Fifth-year senior David Molk got injured in pregame warm-ups and wasn't supposed to play. He missed three snaps.

Daily Sports Editor
NEW ORLEANS - David Molk
only had one leg, but that couldn't
stop him.
Michigan's fifth-year senior
captain, All-American center and
Rimington Awad winner was held
out of the starting lineup after
sustaining a foot injury during
pregame warm-ups before the
Allstate Sugar Bowl.
"Something popped," said
Michigan Athletic Director Dave
Brandon.
"Freak little thing, it just
slipped out," Molk said.
Slip, pull, pop or twist, the
outcome was the same - the
Wolverines were forced to start
little-used redshirt junior backup
Rocko Khoury under center in the
biggest game in recent memory.
"I thought, 'Where's the Rim-
ington award winner guy?' " said
redshirt sophomore offensive
tackle Taylor Lewan. "Then I
found out he was hurt."
Molk's final bill of health from
the team trainers prior to the
game cast a sobering shadow over
the All-American's final game at
Michigan: "I wasn't a go."
"It was something where I had
to get the feelingback - I couldn't
move on it," Molk said.

Molk tried to get loose on the
sideline during Khoury's first
series, watching his replacement
send a pair of errant snaps back to
junior quarterback Denard Robin-
son. The offense went nowhere.
The coaches and trainers had
left the decision up to Molk. After
watching the first series, he made
his decision. He was back under
center for the second drive. He
didn't miss another snap.
"David is a warrior," said Mich-
igan coach Brady Hoke. "He's a
captain on this football team. He
has a lot of pride in Michigan, he
has a lot of pride in this offense.
It means a lot to see him come out
there and perform like he did."
The offense struggled from
start to finish. The dynamic rush-
ing attack of Robinson and red-
shirt sophomore running back
Fitzgerald Toussaint combined
for just 43 yards, by far their low-
est total of the season. But the
players couldn't deny the effect
Molk's return had on stabilizing
the offense early in the game. Rob-
inson found the ball in his hands
on every snap and had more time
in the pocket for his throws.
"I don't know if the offense
needed me, but obviously I wanted
to be out there and help my team,"
Molk said. "I knew I could be a
positive force no matter if I was

50 percent, 40 percent or 100 per-
cent.
"It's something that's within
me - I can't stay off the field, I
muscle through injuries."
It isn't the first time Molk
has battled injury. As a redshirt
sophomore, Molk started four
games before being knocked out
of a matchup against Eastern
Michigan with a foot injury. He
returned for the Penn State game
and suffered a season-ending knee
injury in the first series. This time,
in the Sugar Bowl, it was bearable.
And the team drew a clear line
between hurt and injured.
"We said unless we see bone,
we're not coming out," said fifth-
year senior defensive tackle Ryan
Van Bergen.
The trainers thought Molk was
injured. He decided he was just
hurt.
"Dave Molk has more heart
than I expected," Lewan said.
"At the end of the day, the kid
had a heart. Molk knew. He loves
this team, he loves this university,
and he's going to play for them no
matter what."
As Molk stepped away from
the crowd of teammates celebrat-
ing the overtime victory, he gazed
around the massive Mercedes-
Benz Superdome. It was worth it.
It was worth everything.

His career began inauspi-
ciously, with a historic upset loss
to Appalachian State at Michigan
Stadium. It ended gloriously, with
an overtime epic in New Orleans.
"How we came in and how my
first four seasons went, I thought
we were the stain on Michigan tra-
dition," Molk said, walking slowly
toward the winner's podium on
the turf. "But the reality is that we
came back from everything and
we're back to where Michigan is."
The stoic Molk couldn't wipe
the smile from his face. Michigan
strength and conditioning coach
Aaron Wellman swept his arms
around the fifth-year senior.
Molk only had one leg, but
that's all he needed.
His Michigan career came
to an end on Tuesday. His foot-
ball career is moving to the next
chapter - Molk will now begin
training for the NFL. The scope
of Molk's journey couldn't be cap-
tured better than his final words
after the Wolverines topped Ohio
State on Nov. 26.
"It's been a lot and it's been a
rollercoaster that for some reason
has seemed like it would never get
good," Molk said, his voice rising.
"But we kept fighting.
"It's just like the old saying
goes: Those who stay will be
champions."

Van Bergen's foot, and defense, bend but don't break

By KEVIN RAFTERY
Daily Sports Ediotr
NEW ORLEANS - Ryan Van
Bergen limped off the field, with
trainers under each arm helping
him make it to the sidelines.
He and the Michigan defense
had just made a critical third
down stop in overtime, forc-
ing Virginia Tech to settle for a
37-yard field goal, which Hokie
kicker Justin Myer would miss
wide right just moments later.
Van Bergen had been battling
a foot injury since the second
quarter, when he got caught up
awkwardly in a pile of players.
"My foot just feels like rub-
ber," Van Bergen said after the
game. "I couldn't plant on it or
anything like that.
"It actually went down, like
parallel to my chin when I was
in a pile.
"The next time I was tryingto
plant, I was trying to overcom-
pensate for it, and I put it the
other way and got chopped, so
my toe was coming up to like the
top of my ankle."
Van Bergen's foot was bent,
but it wasn't broken - just like
the Michigan defense in the
Wolverines' 23-20 overtime vic-
tory over Virginia Tech in the
Sugar Bowl on Tuesday night.
The Wolverines gave up sev-
eral key third-and-long plays on
the night. Third and 20. Third
and 12. Third and 8.
"Third-down defense, we
weren't very good at all," defen-
sive coordinator Greg Mattison
said. "A lot of it was missed tack-
les. We had the right defense, we
had guys in the right place, you
just had to get them down."
For most of the game, the
Hokies had little trouble mov-
ing the ball downfield. Yet, the
Michigan defense gave up just
one touchdown all game.

The key? Red-zone defense.
"We didn't play our best game
defensively," Mattison said, "but
we played our best game as far
as keeping them out when you
had to."
No play exemplifies that more
than one that came early in the
second quarter.
After having driven 72 yards
to the Michigan 4-yard line,
the Hokies were faced with a
fourth-and-1.
The Wolverines had already
given up a couple big plays on
the drive, including a 16-yard
completion on third-and-8 and
a 32-yard rush by running back
David Wilson.
Feeling confident, Virginia
Tech coach Frank Beamer elect-
ed to go for it. The Michigan
defense had already bent hard
on the drive.
But as the Hokies lined up,
Van Bergen and fellow lineman
Mike Martin saw something
they recognized. And it paid off.
"Me and Mike called that
play, because we had seen it on
film," Van Bergen said.
"I don't know who ended up
making the play because we just
dove down, but we were ready
for that."
Bend, don't break. The Michi-
gan defenders swallowed up
Virginia Tech quarterback
Logan Thomas, stopping him
just a few inches short of the
first down marker.
"We had to adjust real quick,
last thing," said redshirt junior
linebacker Kenny Demens. "We
just came through. Those guys,
those front four players, they do
a great job."
And on the Wolverines' ensu-
ing offensive drive, they scored
their first touchdown of the
night on a miraculous pass from
junior quarterback Denard Rob-
inson to fifth-year senior receiv-

er Junior Hemingway.
Early in the third quarter, it
was another defensive play that
helped spark the offense.
On first-and-10 from the Vir-
ginia Tech 49, Thomas dropped
back out of the shotgun and
looked left.
He didn't see freshman defen-
sive end Frank Clark.
Clark read it the whole way.
"I saw the quarterback pull
out and try to scramble," Clark
said. "He threw the hitch, and I
jumped up and caught it."
For the defense, it was the
first and only interception of the
night. For the offense, it was just
what the doctor ordered.
"When Frank intercepted
that ball, that was a shot in the
arm for us offensively," said
Michigan offensive coordinator
Al Borges.
The interception gave Michi-
gan the ball at the Virginia Tech
35-yard line and set up the Wol-
verines second touchdown of
the game to give them a 17-6
lead.
But the Hokies continued to

push the Michigan defense to its
breaking point.
Midway through the fourth
quarter, Virginia Tech was faced
with a fourth-and-11 at the Wol-
verines' 35-yard line and elected
to go for it. A stop and Michigan
would be in the driver's seat.
Thomas had other plans.
Noticing that most of his receiv-
ers were covered downfield,
he scrambled left, gaining just
enough yards for the first down.
Moments later, Thomas con-
nected with Marcus Davis for
the score. After the Hokies con-
verted on a two-point attempt, it
was a tie ball game.
But the Wolverines remained
poised.
"We knew it was gonna be a
back and forth game," Martin
said. "We knew they were gonna
step up and make plays, but we
knew that we were gonna step
up and make plays, too."
And make plays they did.
With Virginia Tech driving
and down by three with the
clock winding down, Michigan
had to at least hold the Hokies

The Michigan defense struggled early, but tightened in the redzone, forcing the
Hokies to three field goals and keeping the Wolverines in the game.

to a field goal.
On third-and-7 from the
Michigan 13, the Wolverines
allowed Thomas to complete
another pass - but only for five
yards.
Bend, don't break.
Virginia Tech hit the field
goal and sent it to overtime.
But it didn't matter. When it
needed to most, the Michigan

defense got it done, forcing a
Hokies' three-and-out on their
only overtime possession.
And as Michigan kicker
Brendan Gibbons hit the game
winner, Van Bergen no longer
needed trainers to help him get
on the field to celebrate with his
teammates.
Suddenly, that once-bent foot
felt a whole lot better.

Daily Sports Editor
NEW ORLEANS - Jareth
Glanda was to suffer the same
fate as nearly every other long
snapper in college football. He
would be lost to history.
Long snappers don't have stats
or hero moments. Unless they
mess up, they are rarely men-
tioned by announcers or shown
on television. The only proof
Glanda would've had of him
being on Michigan's now-famed
Team 132 would be the redshirt
sophomore's name on the roster
and his face in the team photo.
Then, at the end of the second
quarter, Glanda struck a victory
for what may be the sport's most
anonymous position. In what
was undoubtedly the strangest
play of Tuesday's Sugar Bowl,
Glanda caught a tipped pass off
a fake field goal for an 11-yard
gain.
"It was the greatest thing
ever" said redshirt sophomore
kicker Brendan Gibbons.
Better than his game-winning
kick?
"Way better."
He made it into the box score.
Nestled between redshirt sopho-
more running back Fitzgerald
Toussiant and senior receiver
Kelvin Grady, Glanda finished
tied as the team's third-leading

bounced off Fuller, over Hokie
defensive tackle Derrick Hop-
kins and into Glanda's hands.
Gain of 11. First down, Michigan.
"I was trying to make a cou-
ple blocks and saw the ball go
over my head and get deflected,"
Glanda said. "I came down with
it. It was pretty cool.
"This is definitely the biggest
catch of my life."
There wasn't much competi-
tion. Glanda got a "little bit of
time" at tightend as asophomore-
- in high school. In college, he
hasn't had much opportunity to
make a play. He only took over
as the team's long snapper this
season. Glanda was thoroughly
unprepared.
"I never do catching drills,"
Glanda said. "I snap all the time,
that's what I do."
The catch didn't mean much,
other than providing Glanda his
first catch and Dileo a comple-
tion on his first collegiate pass.
Michigan stalled at the Virginia
Tech goal line and had Gibbons
hit a field goal anyway.
But it mattered to Glanda. For
a fleeting moment he was living
the dream of all offensive line-
men. He had the ball, rumbling
towards the endzone. When the
historians look back at the 2012
Sugar Bowl, they'll see it in the
box score. Glanda, J., receptions:
one, yards: 11.

receiver.
Glanda said he doesn't
remember much about the play.
Everyone else does.
Michigan had lined up for a
field goal with less than a min-
ute to play in the second quar-
ter. Before the snap, sophomore
receiver Drew Dileo heard
another call from the sideline:
Fire Right. It was a fake. Dileo

had a run-pass option. If he
threw, it was a two-man route,
though he was supposed to be
looking for senior tight end
Kevin Koger running a corner
route.
But there was problem. Dileo
had to relay the call to his line in
the noisy Mercedes-Benz Super-
dome. Half of the line didn't hear
him.

"I get it, I roll out, and Koger's
blocking," Dileo said. "Then I see
(fifth-year senior backup tight
end Steve) Watson and I just
throw it up."
Launching the ball off his
back foot just before getting hit,
Dileo overthrew Watson. Vir-
ginia Tech cornerback Kyle Full-
er jumped for the interception,
but ran into a teammate. The ball

Clark will describe the biggest
play of his Michigan career, a key
interception that set up a touch-
down. Mattison will tease Ryan
about how long his hair used to
be, then smile, remembering how
Ryan rewarded his trust after
Will Heininger went down.
The others make jokes, but
Blake Countess, back then an

ly every Hokie receiver.
Michiganfootball looks like
Countess did after the game.
Smiling and upbeat, he chose to
remember how he stayed step-for-
step with Hokie receiver Danny
Coale, as he caught a would-be
overtime touchdown pass just
inches toofar out ofbounds.
They all find it funny how
soon people forgot the dark
years, what Molk called "The
Mess."
After the Sugar Bowl - after
they had broke the streak, beat-
ing Ohio State - after they won
11 games for just the fifth time in
modern Michigan football histo-
ry, everyone declared Michigan
football "back."
Ten years after the game,
going to make that kick. I knew
he was going to make that kick."
Defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison knew Gibbons had it
in him since he first saw him
kick in spring camp in Ann
Arbor.
"Gibby, the first day I got here
and saw him kicking, I heard his
track record and said, 'No way.
This guy's a good kicker,' "Mat-
tison said.
"I knew he was goingto make
it. That's what we do here."
Even fifth-year senior safety
Troy Woolfolk couldn't help
but smile at the mention of Gib-
bons's turnaround.
"I'm glad you asked about

Hoke will remind them what he
said at the time: "Michigan never
left."
He'll remember they played
Michigan football with an errati-
cally spectacular quarterback,
relentlessly powerful line play,
and a cast of characters who
filled roles: like Fitz Toussaint,
the sidekick, or Hemingway, the
big-play savior.
How fitting, he'll say, it was for
the seniors to go out that way -
overcoming and winning when
all logic said they should've been
lying and dying.
The players make Michigan
football what it is. And Team 132
never left.
After the Sugar Bowl, when
the ride stopped and everyone
looked for someone to hug, Van
Bergen turned to Molk and
joked, "I don't know when the
movie is coming out."
"It's a fairytale," Van Bergen
said. "It doesn't happen like that
in real life all the time."
There's time to sort out the
future, to see if Hoke caught
magic in a bottle or if this is
just the beginning. Is this what
that," Woolfolk said.
He had something to get off
his chest.
Last season, after backup
kicker Seth Broekhuizen missed
a kick to put Michigan at 1-for-5
on the season, Woolfolk - then
out with an ankle injury - sent
out a tweet that read: "Kickers
wanted."
The tweet no longer exists.
No longer does Michigan's need
for a competent kicker.
"Gibbons really put my foot
in my mouth," Woolfolk said.
"I won't doubt a Michigan Man
again.
"When he went up there
tonight I knew he was going to

Michigan football is supposed to

Lucky and skilled. We'll find out,
but it's how Team 132 played
Michigan football.
Athletic Director Dave Bran-
don has three Big Ten Champi-
onship rings from the time he
played at Michigan. But he never
won 11 games at Michigan. He
doesn't have a Sugar Bowl ring.
"I know how important (that
feeling) is," Brandon said. "It's
even more important years from
now than it is tonight."
Knowing all too well, Brandon
imparted a piece of wisdom to
the seniors.
"You're goingto wear that

make it. There was no doubt in
my mind."
Gibbons's three field goals
proved crucial in a game in
which the offense mustered just
184 yards - fewer yards than
the Hokie offense accumulated
in the first half alone.
But that just might make
sense. Because just like the
resurgent Wolverines had the
odds stacked against them, so
did Gibbons.
"Brendan's a microcosm of
this team - he proved everyone
wrong," said junior defensive
end Craig Roh.
It just took time. Time and

BRENDAN GIBBONS: Brendan
Gibbons has redeemed himself on
the biggest stage possible. After
going 1-for-5 a season ago, it raised
some eyebrows when Michigan
coach Brady Hoke named him the
starter at the beginning of the
season. He's been solid all season.
That didn't change in the bright
lights of the Superdome. He hit
three field goals in the game, a
24-yarder and a 39-yarder before
hitting the 37-yard game winner.
It was a fitting ending: one of the

with him about what to think
about as he kicks. So what was he
thinking about before the biggest
kick of his career? Brunettes. It
worked, he made the kick and found
himself at the bottom of giant post-
game dog pile. Those brunettes?
I'm sure Brendan is going to get

DARRYL STONUM: After being
suspended and forced to redshirt
this season due to a drunk driving
charge, all Darryl Stonum could
do in the Sugar Bowl was stand
on the bench, wave a towel and
watch Junior Hemingway, his
roommate, win the MVP award.
Sure, Stonum isn't feeling totally
blue: his boys just won the Sugar
Bowl. But there is the bittersweet
feeling, wondering what he could
have done on the big stage. "It was
pretty hard," Stonum said. "But
everything happens for a reason.
I'm just glad coach Hoke kept me
around to be a part of this. And
I'm back - I'm back now." Stonum
will be back to play Alabama in his
native Texas. He'll have a chance
to get his 'M' ring for graduating
from Michigan. He'll have a chance
at the NFL. He'll have a chance
to live out his senior year. But he
has to be wondering, was ita year
too late? Should his last game in
a Michigan uniform have been
in New Orleans, bringing about
the return of Michigan football?

NOTABLE
QUOTABLE
It shows our fight. It shows our determination.
It shows everything we've been through, because
we've been through a lot. We've been through
a lot. We've been through so much.
Nobody understands that. But to come out here and
win this football game today with these people I've
worked hard with from day one,
it feels so good.

Lewan's comedy and confidence invigorates Team 132

*I

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily SportsEditor
NEW ORLEANS - Taylor
Lewan never lost faith.
With the Virginia Tech foot-
ball team facing a third-and-2
from the Michigan 8ayard line,
Lewan stood up from the bench
and put his helmet on. The red-
shirt sophomore offensive tack-
le wouldn't watch the next play.
At stake was the Allstate
Sugar Bowl crown. Michigan
was clinging to a 3-point lead in
the final minute, and the Hokies
were 8 yards away from a game-
winningtouchdown.
Lewan strapped the helmet
tight and walked to the right of
the benches.
"Nothing to worry about,
friend," he said with a smile,
patting a team spokesperson
on the shoulder. "No reason to
worry."
He looked back to the field in
time to see a referee toss a flag.
False start on Virginia Tech.
One 5-yard pass later, the Hok-
ies were lining up for a field

goal. Crisis averted, Lewan and
the Wolverines were on the
brink of overtime.
Lewan started toward the
bench, then looked back and
winked.
"Told you," Lewan said.
It's the implicit confidence
Lewan has shown since he broke
onto the scene as a redshirt
freshman starter at tackle last
season.
How can he be so confident,
especially in a game of that
magnitude? Fifth-year senior
center David Molk doesn't like
putting the game in the hands of
the defense, calling it "the worst
feeling ever as a football player."
He likes control.
Lewan might not watch the
play, but he has trust. Trust
in a defense that one year ago
allowed 52 points to Mississippi
State in the Gator Bowl.
That kind of confidence
seems almost irrational. But
maybe it isn't. For Lewan, it's
about history.
"Did you watch Notre Dame
last year?" Lewan asked, limp-

The defense burst through to
knock down Fighting Illini
quarterback Nathan Scheel-
haase to seal the win.
So the Sugar Bowl finish
wasn't unprecedented.
"This team knows what
they're doing," Lewan said.
"This team does not quit."
But that confidence says as
much about Lewan's personality
as it does the Wolverines' track
record. Regardless of time or
place, the 6-foot-8, 302-pound
lineman is armed with his quick
wit, off-the-wall commentary
and, of course, tattoos.
Standing outside the locker-
room door after the game, he
could only think of one way
to describe his emotions after
winning the Sugar Bowl. Out of
the 64,512 fans in attendance,
hundreds of credentialed media
members and the entirety of
Michigan's Team 132, Lewan
made the comparison no one
else could.
"Have you ever seen a box of
kittens? It's the feeling you get
when you see a box of kittens,"

Lewan told AnnArbor.com
Moments later, he charged
into the locker room and inter-
rupted a few teammates, includ-
ing fellow redshirt junior
offensive lineman Patrick
Omameh.
"Hey guys, tell me this,"
Lewan shouted. "Who would
win this fight: A turkey or a wol-
verine?"
The presentation was good,
drawing a few chuckles. (Hint:
The wolverine wins.)
But Lewan has his serious
moments. He sprained an ankle
in pregame warm-ups, tweaked
his thumb in the first quarter
and battled through the pain on
the line of scrimmage.
And as he slowly limped
off the field, Lewan offered a
thought he'll keep with him for
the next few months - it's the
motivation that will carry next
season's Team 133.
"Look at the confetti around
you," Lewan said, gesturing
back toward midfield. "Nobody
wants to be here one year and
not the next."

Sugar Bowl. It is a tradition between the quarterback and his blindside protector.
