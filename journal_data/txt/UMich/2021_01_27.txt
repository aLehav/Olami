The University of Michigan’s 

Senate Assembly met virtually 
Monday afternoon to provide an 
update on the work of the Faculty 
COVID-19 Council, specifically 
discussing 
how 
to 
improve 

messaging from administration 
to students. Senate Assembly 
also heard from Kevin Hegarty, 
the executive vice president 
and chief financial officer, who 
will be retiring at the end of 
the semester, and voted for the 
Senate Advisory Committee on 
University Affairs’ nominating 
committee.

Luke Hyde, a professor of 

psychology and member of the 
Faculty 
COVID-19 
Council, 

said 
conversations 
between 

members of the council and 
administration 
revealed 
that 

members 
from 
across 
the 

University community should be 
offering their input on COVID-
related changes. The COVID-19 
Faculty Council was established 
in October to serve as a faculty 
voice in administrative decisions 
after the Faculty Senate passed 
a vote of no confidence in U-M 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel’s 

leadership in September.

“The faculty COVID Council 

has met five times bi-weekly on 
Friday mornings,” Hyde said. 
“The 
President 
and 
Provost 

have expressed that they have 
found it helpful for them to get 
feedback from sort of average or 
non-COVID medical and public 
health-related faculty.”

Hyde assured faculty that 

Schlissel and Provost Susan 
Collins have been addressing 
all issues and ideas brought 
forth by Senate members. Hyde 
said Schlissel and Collins have 
been responsive to concerns, 
though 
he 
admitted 
that 

faculty members have differing 
views on how issues should be 
addressed.

“Some of the major topics that 

we’ve addressed so far have been 
messaging and communication 
both about COVID broadly but 
also vaccine rollout, and also 
sort of messages to students,” 
Hyde said.

Hyde said he was disheartened 

to hear that the University has 
the capacity to vaccinate more 
than 25,000 students a week but 
is not receiving enough vaccines 
from the state to do so.

“I will be honest, probably 

the hardest thing that I had in 
the last meeting was learning 
that even if things go really well, 
they may not be vaccinating 
undergrads until the fall,” Hyde 
said. “And for whatever it’s 
worth, this is not U-M’s fault.”

All University of Michigan 

athletics will be paused for 
two 
weeks 
starting 
Sunday, 

Jan. 24 in accordance with a 
recommendation from the state 
health department according to 
messages obtained by The Daily 
and confirmed by a source close 
to the athletic department. The 
order, which halts all athletic 
activity 
including 
practice, 

is limited exclusively to U-M 
athletics after a recent influx 
of positive cases within several 
Michigan teams. 

According 
to 
a 
statement 

released 
by 
the 
athletic 

department Saturday night, the 
Wolverines have been following 
Big Ten testing and reporting 
protocals, 
but 
the 
Michigan 

Department 
of 
Health 
and 

Human Services is taking a more 
stringent approach to the novel 
COVID-19 B.1.1.7 variant.

A source told The Daily that 

there were five confirmed cases 
of the new variant, with 15 more 
presumed positives throughout 
the athletic department. The 
novel strain was first introduced 
to Michigan at the beginning of 
the semester by a U-M athlete 
traveling 
from 
the 
United 

Kingdom. All members of the 
athletic department are expected 
to quarantine for 14 days.

“Canceling 
competitions 
is 

never something we want to do, 
but with so many unknowns 
about this variant of COVID-19, 
we must do everything we can 
to minimize the spread among 
student-athletes, coaches, staff, 
and to the student-athletes at 
other 
schools,” 
said 
athletic 

director Warde Manuel in the 

statement 
released 
Saturday 

night.

An 
MDHHS 
spokeswoman 

confirmed that five cases of the 
variant were found on Michigan 
athletic teams. An MDHHS 
memo provided to The Daily laid 
out the state’s recommendations 
for the next two weeks. Those 
include:

- 
 
Immediate 
14-day 

quarantine for all Michigan 
athletes, household members 
and close contacts starting from 
Jan. 23

- A review of all positive test 

results in the past two weeks

- Immediate PCR testing of 

all team members, including 
genetic 
sequencing 
of 
any 

positive tests

- Thrice-weekly PCR testing 

during quarantine

- The assumption that all 

cases linked to the outbreak 

are variant infections, pending 
confirmation

The 
memo 
also 
provides 

campus-wide recommendations, 
saying that if the variant is 
detected in an organization, 
there should be twice-a-week 
PCR testing for all members 
of that organization. It also 
recommends ramping up testing 
for the entire community, and 
a 10-day quarantine for any 
students returning to campus 
from out of state or abroad.

This past week 22 student-

athletes 
tested 
positive 
for 

COVID-19 per release, 13 more 
than the week prior. No coaches 
or staff tested positive.

a Bulldog tested positive the 

day after the game, leading to 
two missed games.

The 
Michigan 
Daily 
sat 

down 
with 
University 
of 

Michigan 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel to discuss COVID-19 
vaccinations, the University’s 
climate goals, racial equity on 
campus and the Jan. 6 events at 
the U.S. Capitol. This interview 
has been edited and condensed 
for clarity.

Mark Schlissel: First of 

all, welcome back and happy 
New Year. The inauguration’s 
tomorrow, and I know there’s 
some anxiety among many, 
or at least some people — 
students or faculty and staff 
— because of all the violence 
that occurred in D.C. and 
threats of violence in the 
statehouse, so I just wanted 
to reassure you and students 
that our public safety folks 
have been in communications 
with all the other security 
partners 
around 
the 
state 

and around the country, and 
we’ve increased staffing and 
set up contingencies. We don’t 
expect problems on campus, 
but we just encourage the 
community if they’re anxious 
to talk about it. Talk about it 
with one another and try to 
stay balanced as we watch this 
change in the administration.

The Michigan Daily: What 

is the biggest challenge facing 
the University of Michigan in 
2021?

MS: The biggest challenge 

remains the pandemic, and 
it’s the challenge of, how do 
we continue to deliver on 
the mission of the University 
while keeping people healthy 
and safe, and having a good 
Michigan experience to the 
extent 
possible 
given 
the 

limitations of the disease, the 
virus.

TMD: So on that note, 

some health professionals are 
raising concerns over the more 
contagious coronavirus strain 
from the United Kingdom, 

which 
was 
discovered 
in 

Washtenaw County Saturday. 
What does this development 
mean for the University?

MS: I think it is of concern. 

If there’s any good news so far, 
there’s no indication that it 
produces a more severe disease, 
so it’s not more dangerous for 
your health. The other bit of 
good news is it still remains 
susceptible to the vaccine. 

But the report of cases 

in Washtenaw County isn’t 
surprising. I think all of us 
have to presume that if it’s in 
Washtenaw County, it’ll be in 
our campus community. It’s 
hard to imagine it wouldn’t 
since we have so many people. 
We’re really one community, 
so I think we have to treat one 
another and presume as if the 
strain’s around. 

And so far as best we 

know, the methods to prevent 
transmission are the same — 
social distancing,

U.S. Rep. tackles bipartisanship, climate change & more

GABRIEL BOUDAGH

Daily Staff Reporter

U.S. 
Rep. 
Debbie 
Dingell, 

D-Mich., 
gave 
her 
annual 

State of the District address 
Monday morning to an audience 
of 
about 
700 
people 
via 

livestream. The event, hosted 
by the Southern Wayne County 
Regional Chamber, updated the 
community on Dingell’s recent 
work.

To start off her annual address 

Dingell discussed the pandemic’s 
impact on the daily life of her 
constituents.

“The most important thing 

for us right now is to stay safe,” 
Dingell said. “We are using 
technology to touch each other, 
stay close and talk about the 
issues we care about. There’s 
nothing normal about the year 
that we’ve been in. Because of all 
the chaos and the uncertainty, 
traditions are something that we 
actually hold on to tighter to give 
us a sense of normalcy and hope.”

Dingell also discussed the 

riot at the Capitol Building that 
occurred earlier this month and 
her experience during the attack. 
Dingell, who is a member of the 
U.S. House of Representatives 
Problem 
Solvers 
Caucus, 
a 

bipartisan group with equal 
numbers 
of 
Democratic 
and 

Republican lawmakers, said the 
attempted insurrection on Jan. 6 
strengthened her commitment to 
fighting for democracy.

“I didn’t envision the depths 

of 
division 
that 
we 
would 

experience over these last few 
weeks,” Dingell said. “Never 
in a million years did I think I 
would find myself sheltering in 
an undisclosed location in the 
United States Capitol, while 
my fellow citizens attacked a 
sacred building that gives young 
democracies around the world 

hope. … All of us have to be 
engaged for democracy to work. 
This needs to be a wake-up call 
for everybody.”

During her address, Dingell 

discussed her early commitment 
to combating the spread of the 
coronavirus.

“Confronting and combatting 

COVID has been my priority for 
the last year,” Dingell said. “I 
was one of the first members of 
Congress that wrote to anybody 
about it. I wrote to the CDC and 
said, ‘Why are we screening at 
some airports and not ones like 
Detroit?’”

In 
early 
January, 
Dingell 

requested that the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention 
provide an update on the steps 
they were taking to ensure all 
travelers coming from China — 
the early epicenter of the virus 
— were safe from COVID-19. 
The CDC expanded additional 
screening facilities at some major 
U.S. airports but some, including 
the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne 
County Airport, still had direct 
flights to areas where COVID-
19 cases were being reported. 
COVID-19 screenings were first 
introduced at DTW on Jan. 28, 
2020.

Dingell also discussed the 

bills she plans to introduce in 
Congress this year, including 
legislation to help strengthen 
personal protective equipment 
supplies in hospitals and to 
ensure underserved communities 
are provided with clean water.

“We’re introducing legislation 

to 
strengthen 
the 
Strategic 

National Stockpile, but we’re 
going to make sure we don’t get 
stuck flat-footed the way that we 
did last time where we didn’t have 
PPE equipment for our frontline 
workers,” Dingell said. “We’ve 
got to increase access to home & 
community-based care. I will be 

introducing legislation, this week, 
that will prohibit water shutoffs 
nationwide and provide financial 
assistance 
for 
low-income 

households to pay for drinking 
water.” 

Dingell, who is on the House 

Committee 
on 
Energy 
and 

Commerce said she plans to 
protect jobs at auto plants while 
introducing new technologies to 
this sector.

“Last year, I talked about 

the undeniable shift towards 
electric vehicles that is gaining 
momentum 
and 
self-driving 

vehicles,” Dingell said. “Even 
with a pandemic that upended 
our daily lives, this shift is 
continuing … I want to make 
sure that we’re bringing in newer 
technology and newer products 
to the plants that we have down 
here and that people think that 
our communities are a good place 
to live.” 

Dingell said she plans to work 

with the Biden Administration to 
remove PFAS and other chemicals 
from local waters, as well as fix 
local infrastructure and introduce 
a renewable energy plan. After 
her address, Dingell answered 
questions about student debt and 
renewable energy incentives. 

The first audience question 

touched on the student debt crisis, 
to which Dingell replied that it 
is important to find a balanced 
solution. 

“I think some of them are 

going to be viable because I think 
our students are really hurting,” 
Dingell said. “The question is 
what’s the right formula … We 
have to figure out how to lower the 
cost of education to young people 
and make it more affordable to 
everybody on an equal playing 
field.”

La Casa releases statement on Victors 

Award following drop in Latinx enrollment

The University of Michigan’s 

central 
Latinx 
student 

organization, La Casa, released 
a statement on Jan. 19 speaking 
out 
against 
the 
Office 
of 

Enrollment 
Management’s 

decision to change the amount 
of financial aid offered to 
out-of-state 
students 
with 

demonstrated need. 

The Victors Award, which 

replaced the Provost Award in 
April 2020, will be available for 
incoming out-of-state students 
in 
the 
class 
of 
2024 
and 

beyond. The Provost Award, 
last distributed to members 
of the class of 2023, met the 
full demonstrated need of out-
of-state students and did not 
include a merit component. 
The Victors Award offers a 
flat $8,000 per year award and 
includes merit consideration.

La Casa’s statement outlines 

the 
organization’s 
concerns 

about the change. They say the 
new award disproportionately 
impacts the Latinx community 
and resulted in a 16% decrease 
seen in first-year Latinx student 
enrollment for the Fall 2020 
semester. 

Public Policy junior Juliana 

Collado, who recently finished 
her term as La Casa’s lead 
director, stated that though 
they 
know 
the 
COVID-19 

pandemic may be a contributing 
factor, the decrease in Latinx 
first-year enrollment provoked 
La Casa to write the statement. 

“What 
we 
know 
is 
the 

numbers,” Collado said. “What 
we also know is that Latinx 

students are particularly loan 
adverse. Because the transition 
from the Provost Award to 
the Victors Award (provides 
students with a) significantly 
(smaller) amount of money, 
it 
just 
is 
inaccessible 
for 

students that can’t afford (the 
University). ”

La Casa has discussed the 

change with OEM. According to 
La Casa Internal Director Xalma 
Palomino, an LSA sophomore, 
La 
Casa’s 
discussions 
with 

administrators at OEM were 
responsive, yet brief.

“They were answering our 

questions but it was only a 
30-minute meeting so there 
wasn’t much that we could 
cover,” Palomino said. “The two 
main things that we took away 
from that meeting is one, they 
said that they weren’t going to 
change the policy this year, and 
two, that they wanted … other 
colleges across the University 
to pick up on that funding.”

La Casa External Director 

Rebeca Yanes, an LSA junior, 
was also at the meeting and said 
she thinks OEM did not seem to 
have any plans to make changes 
to their decision to implement 
the Victors Award.

“They made it clear that 

this was a decision that was 
already made and that they 
were planning on continuing 
it for the next year,” Yanes 
said. “It makes it seem like the 
University of Michigan isn’t 
reachable. It’s not accessible. 
We talked about members of 
the Latinx community being 
loan adverse (and) not receiving 
sufficient 
aid 
from 
the 

University is sending a message 
that (this University may not be 

accessible for them).” 

Rick 
Fitzgerald, 
assistant 

vice president for the University 
of Michigan’s Office of Public 
Affairs, stated in an email to 
The Daily that the decision to 
switch to the Victors Award 
came from the fact that the 
Provost Award was no longer 
financially sustainable.

“While the Provost’s Award 

meets full demonstrated need 
for eligible continuing non-
resident students, the amount 
awarded changes from year 
to year as individual financial 
need is determined annually,” 
Fitzgerald 
wrote. 
“It 
was 

important 
not 
to 
adversely 

affect the affordability of a 
Michigan education for non-
resident students who were 
already 
here 
despite 
the 

unsustainable finances of this 
award in the longer term. The 
introduction 
of 
the 
Victors 

Award is intended to continue to 
support non-resident students.”

Fitzgerald also noted that 

the University and the Office 
of 
Enrollment 
Management 

share La Casa’s concerns with 
the enrollment decrease, but 
suggests that further analysis 
is needed in understanding 
the factors that may have 
contributed to this decrease, 
including 
the 
COVID-19 

pandemic.

“The university is aware of La 

Casa’s concerns and shares La 
Casa’s goals of greater college 
affordability and diversity in 
our student body,” Fitzgerald 
wrote. “While La Casa points 
to the changes in financial 
aid awards as the reason, we 
believe more analysis is needed 
to fully understand how many 

factors — most notably, the 
COVID-19 pandemic — may 
have 
influenced 
enrollment 

decisions … rest assured that 
the university is committed to 
doing this analysis.”

As a part of La Casa’s efforts 

to challenge the Victors Award, 
the 
organization 
has 
asked 

community 
members 
who 

previously received the Provost 
Award to prepare testimonials 
explaining its impact on their 
educational experience.

La 
Casa 
Undergraduate 

Advisor Tania Zaragoza, an LSA 
junior, was one of these Provost 
Award recipients.

“It’s 
actually 
through 

(receiving the Provost’s Award) 
that I’m able to attend the 
University,” Zaragoza said. “It’s 
pretty straightforward. If you 
don’t have the money, then it’s 
just not a possibility, no matter 
how much you want to be here.”

Moving forward, La Casa 

hopes 
to 
continue 
their 

conversations 
with 
the 

University 
to 
help 
further 

support not only the Latinx 
community, but all low-income 
first-year students affected by 
the new aid policy.

“We’re 
not 
just 
here 
to 

protest (and) be angry at the 
University,” Collado said. “We 
have actively engaged with the 
University (and) we want that 
partnership reciprocated to us. 
The University has shoveled out 
millions of dollars to different 
DEI 
initiatives 
(and 
that) 

shows the value that they see in 
diversity, equity and inclusion. 
Here’s another way that they 
can show that they care about 
DEI, about having accessible 
education.”

CAMPUS LIFE

Organization claims new award disproportionately impacts the Latinx community

masks, avoiding large groups, 
spending time outdoors when 
the weather allows, washing 
hands more frequently, those 
kind of things, and I think if we 
can remain vigilant about those 
things a very high percentage of 
the time, I think the campus will 
do okay despite the presence of 
this more transmissible strain. 
If we let our guard down more 
people will get infected if the 
strain is around.

TMD: Can you talk about what 

the 
slower-than-anticipated 

vaccine 
distribution 
and 

administration means for U-M?

MS: The good news is, having 

a vaccine that works as well as 
these two existing vaccines is just 
remarkable. 95% effectiveness 
is about as good as it gets for a 
vaccine. The challenge is the 
supply, you know, can we make 
enough of it and how quickly can 
we make it? It’s a novel kind of 
vaccine … and so it’s complicated, 
and ramping up the production 
to the level of hundreds of 
millions of doses has never been 
done before, and it’s challenging. 

Michigan Medicine has gotten 

our campus to the stage where 
we can deliver between 12,000 to 
25,000 doses a week. So, if we had 
enough vaccines now, it would 
take us two weeks to vaccinate 
the entire student community in 
Ann Arbor. So, that’s great. The 
problem is we don’t have enough 
vaccines.

We put in a request each week 

for how many doses we want, 
and in the last couple of weeks, 
we haven’t gotten nearly the 
number of doses. And it’s not the 
state’s fault — they don’t have the 
supply. So, we’re ready to very 
aggressively vaccinate everyone 
in the order of their eligibility as 
soon as we have the supply. 

TMD: We know you don’t 

gamble — you’ve told us that 
before — but what do you 
think the chances are that the 
University will be administering 
vaccines to the general student 
population this semester?

MS: I think it’s rather unlikely 

that we will get to have enough 
supply and work our way through 
all the other priority groups 
to be able to begin vaccinating 
students before the end of the 
semester. I would love to be 
proven wrong. So the priority 
is to give the vaccine to people 
for whom the disease is even 

more dangerous. And because 
the students are in an age group 
that is least likely to have a 
lethal outcome, on average, your 
priority is the lowest. 

However, amongst the student 

body there are people that have 
high risk. People with certain 
underlying diseases that put 
them in a high-risk group, they 
might get vaccinated before the 
end of the semester. But healthy 
students that are typical — no 
unusual health issues — I would 
hope 
that 
vaccine 
becomes 

available by the summer. 

My hope for next fall is that we 

can have a high enough fraction 
of everybody in our community 
vaccinated that we can have a 
semester that looks a lot more 
like a normal semester. I don’t 
think it’ll look like a completely 
normal semester — we’ll still 
have to be careful. If you want 
to be realistically optimistic, I 
think next fall we’ve got a shot at 
a much higher sort of quality of 
experience with much more stuff 
in person.

TMD: 
The 
President’s 

Commission 
on 
Carbon 

Neutrality released its draft 
recommendations in December, 
and 
after 
opportunity 
for 

public comment it will deliver 
its 
final 
recommendations 

to 
you 
in 
February. 
We’re 

wondering what’s the process 
you’ll use to evaluate the final 
recommendations 
and 
decide 

which parts to act on?

MS: The University has been 

continuing to work on its carbon 
neutrality goals and its other 
sustainability goals while we 
wait for this commission to tell 
us a timeline and a prioritized 
set of things we can do to get to 
neutrality, so I’m pretty excited 
that it’s coming up to its stage of 
making recommendations. All 
along, I’ve been meeting with 
the co-chairs of the process, 
Professor Forrest and Jennifer 
Haverkamp. 

What I can guarantee is the 

report won’t be taken and put on 
a shelf. The report, we’re going 
to address the things that are 
straightforward and simple to 
address immediately. And then, 
we’re going to spend enough time 
to really understand the bigger 
and more complicated things 
and then focus on those as well. 
The response is meant to be an 
action-oriented response. 

The biggest thing in that report 

that I’m most interested in and 
then we’re going to need to study 
is to convert how we heat and 

cool all the buildings on campus. 
To go from steam heat generated 
by fossil fuels to geothermal and 
electric heat pumping, which 
would require literally tearing 
up every pipe and replacing every 
pipe that goes through every 
building on campus and digging 
these boreholes into the ground, 
tens of thousands of them, to do 
this geothermal heat exchange. 

Other things they’re going to 

propose are likely to be shorter-
term, 
more 
straightforward 

and 
well-justified 
and 
we’ll 

just do them. So those are the 
extremes, a decades-long, multi-
billion dollar project. And you 
can imagine with a multi-billion 
dollar project, we’re a university 
that has lots of resources, we 
surely do, but everything we do 
has an opportunity cost. So the 
question would be if we spent 
billions of dollars on one thing, 
what are the things we’re not 
going to do to balance that out. 
And that’s the discussion we 
need to have with the faculty, 
with the students, with the deans 
and with the regents. 

TMD: 
Carbon 
offsetting, 

according 
to 
the 
draft 

recommendations, is when an 
organization counterbalances its 
direct emissions by investing in 
or purchasing credits associated 
with 
verifiable 
emissions 

reductions 
or 
sequestration 

efforts somewhere else on the 
planet. Proponents argue that 
because climate change is a global 
problem, it makes sense to reduce 
emissions wherever it’s cheapest 
and 
easiest. 
But 
opponents 

argue that carbon offsetting 
allows wealthy institutions to 
externalize emission reduction 
while continuing to burn fossil 
fuels. What is your view on the 
proper role of carbon offsetting 
in carbon neutrality efforts?

MS: 
You’ve 
laid 
out 
the 

problem. So, the leadership team 
and I and the regents need to 
understand it better. So it really 
is a dilemma. I understand where 
the advocates are coming from, 
it is a global problem. Of course, 
everyone in the world can’t buy 
offsets, because at the end of the 
day, what everyone in the world 
has to do is stop emitting so much 
carbon. We’ll run out of offsets. I 
also don’t want the purchase of 
offsets to compete financially 
with the investments it’s going 
to take for us to reduce our own 
carbon release. 

So, if we buy offsets for X 

number of millions of dollars a 
year, I don’t think that relieves 

us of the obligation to diminish 
our own carbon output. But, it 
gets rid of a lot of the resources 
that we would be using to invest 
in things like the geothermal 
system for example. So we have 
to study, that’s going to be a 
hard one. And from what I’ve 
heard, the committee itself is 
not of one mind about offsets, 
and then they’ve been getting 
comments 
back 
from 
the 

broader community of experts 
and advocates. So I think it’s 
something we’re going to have 
to look hard at, but I’m willing 
to consider anything that gets 
recommended.

TMD: We wanted to follow 

up about the MLK symposium 
yesterday. In light of nationwide 
protests for racial justice, you 
said in June that “The important 
movements and calls for action 
we are seeing emphasize the 
need for us to do more to end 
systemic racism in our society 
and on our campuses.” What has 
the University done to address 
systemic racism on its campuses 
since then?

MS: To put it in context — and 

this came up yesterday at the 
symposium — this is a marathon, 
racism. It’s been around almost 
forever in various forms — 
certainly throughout the history 
of our own country. And as hard 
as we work at it, I think we have 
to have a commitment to work on 
it basically forever. However, in 
the context of the awful events 
of the last year, particularly the 
multitude of police killings of 
Black people, most of whom were 
unarmed, it has focused societal 
attention on the issue in a way 
that gives us an opportunity to 
push harder. 

So amongst the things we’ve 

been doing on campus, most 
recently, we launched the task 
force that the provost and I set 
up around public safety at the 
University. I’ve spoken with 
many people of color, not just 
African Americans, but many 
people 
who 
don’t 
feel 
safe 

around the police. We need to 
understand how we do policing 
on our campus and how people 
feel about how we do policing, 
and try to make ourselves best in 
class. That effort just launched 
within the last couple of weeks. 
There 
will 
be 
preliminary 

reports during the semester, and 
then a final report at the end of 
the semester.

President 
Joe 
Biden 

was sworn in as the 46th 
president of the United States 
Wednesday afternoon, taking 
office at a moment of deep-
rooted political polarization 
in America following the Jan. 
6 insurrection at the Capitol 
Building.

“This is democracy’s day,” 

Biden said in his inaugural 
address, reflecting upon what 
he called the “cascading crises” 
of the past year — including the 
COVID-19 pandemic, economic 
crash and racial inequity, along 
with 
the 
insurrection 
that 

led to then-President Donald 
Trump’s second impeachment 
on Jan. 13. 

Prior to the ceremony, Biden 

tweeted “It’s a new day in 
America.”

The tweet came minutes 

after Trump left the White 
House for the last time as 
president. 
Trump 
did 
not 

attend 
the 
inauguration, 

though former Vice President 
Mike 
Pence 
did. 
The 
last 

president to intentionally skip 
a successor’s inauguration was 
Andrew Johnson in 1869 due to 
animosity between him and his 
successor, Ulysses Grant, after 
being on opposing sides during 
the Civil War.

In his inaugural address, 

Biden thanked his supporters 
and 
acknowledged 
his 

commitment to all Americans, 
including those who did not 
support him. Biden emphasized 
the democratic right to dissent 
peacefully while maintaining a 
union.

“I will fight as hard for those 

who did not support me as 
those who did,” Biden said. “We 
must end this uncivil war that 

pits red against blue … We have 
never failed in America when 
we have acted together.”

LSA junior Ryan Fisher, chair 

of the University of Michigan’s 
chapter of College Republicans, 
reiterated Biden’s call for unity 
in an email to The Michigan 
Daily.

“We wish for a peaceful 

transition 
to 
the 
Biden 

Administration, 
one 
that 

hopefully will be characterized 
by 
the 
unity 
and 
cultural 

healing that Biden spoke of so 
frequently,” Fisher said.

During his speech, Biden 

also 
denounced 
extremism, 

white supremacy and domestic 

terrorism, saying the country 
will 
confront 
these 
issues 

during his tenure.

“We must reject the culture 

in 
which 
facts 
themselves 

are 
manipulated 
and 
even 

manufactured,” Biden said.

LSA 
sophomore 
Kenny 

Larson, a director of research 
and 
operations 
for 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan’s 

chapter of Students for Biden, 
said watching the inauguration 
was 
a 
surreal 
moment, 

particularly as Biden took his 
oath.

“I think really the most 

impactful moment was just 
hearing him sit down and say 

the words of oath,” Larson 
said. “It was really impactful 
for me not only as a citizen and 
a voter, but as an American 
and Joe Biden supporter, to 
hear someone that I genuinely 
believe 
will 
actually 
live 

up to the presidential and 
constitutional oath that he’s 
taking.”

Biden closed the speech with 

a silent prayer for the over 
400,000 American lives lost to 
COVID-19 and with an oath to 
the country.

“I give my word that I 

will always level with you,” 
Biden said. “I will defend 
the constitution, I’ll defend 

our 
democracy, 
I’ll 
defend 

America.”

This transition of power 

came after Kamala Harris was 
sworn in as vice president, 
making history as the first 
female, Black and South Asian 
American vice president in 
American history.

Michigan 
Gov. 
Gretchen 

Whitmer, who was appointed 
co-chair of the Presidential 
Inaugural Committee, attended 
the inauguration.

“The country is ready for a 

leader who listens to medical 
experts to lead our country’s 
COVID-19 response and works 
on 
behalf 
of 
hard-working 

Americans,” 
Whitmer 
said 

in a Tuesday press release. 
“I am honored to attend the 
inauguration … and ready to 
begin working closely with 
each of them to fight this virus, 
save lives, and put the country 
back on track.”

Prior to the inauguration, 

LSA 
sophomore 
Julia 

Schettenhelm, a representative 
from the University’s chapter 
of College Democrats, said she 
was proud of the new leadership 
but said there is more work to 
be done.

“We are looking forward 

to the next four years under 
the leadership of President 
Joe Biden and Vice President 
Kamala Harris,” Schettenhelm 
said. “While today is a day to 
celebrate, we also acknowledge 
that there is a lot of work 
that needs to be done going 
forward.”

Following 
the 
ceremony, 

Biden 
signed 
17 
executive 

orders, more than any other 
modern president on his first 
day. These sweeping executive 
orders 
seek 
to 
unwind 

policies 
issued 
by 
Trump 

administration, 
including 

halting construction of the wall 
along the Mexican-American 
border, reversing travel bans 
that target Muslim-majority 
countries and imposing a mask 
mandate on federal property. 
Biden 
also 
announced 
the 

U.S. 
would 
be 
rejoining 

international agreements like 
the Paris Climate Agreement 
and realigning with the World 
Health Organization.

Larson said he felt Biden’s 

plan for the first day set a 
promising precedent for the 
months to come.

“I think that Joe Biden’s 

gonna have a very bold plan and 
that that agenda will hopefully 
hit the ground running in the 
first 100 days,” Larson said.

Kamala 
Harris, 
former 

Senator from California, was 
sworn in as the 49th vice 
president of the United States 
Wednesday afternoon, breaking 
barriers as the first woman, the 
first Black American and the first 
South Asian American to serve 
in the position. The swearing-in 
ceremony was conducted by U.S. 
Supreme Court Justice Sonia 
Sotomayor, the first Hispanic 
and Latina woman to serve on 
the Supreme Court.

Two bibles were used for the 

ceremony, at Harris’s request. 
The first belonged to Regina 
Shelton, a family friend Harris 
viewed as a second mother, and 
the second belonged to the late 
Justice 
Thurgood 
Marshall, 

the first Black member of the 
Supreme Court. 

LSA junior Jasmine Williams, 

a member of the University of 
Michigan’s chapter of Alpha 
Kappa Alpha — a Black sorority 
of which Harris was a member 
at Howard University— said she 
is doubly inspired by Harris’s 
milestone. Williams is also a 
member of the executive board 
of the Black Student Union, 
which helped make food boxes 
for those voting on campus back 
in November.

“Yes, we have had our first 

African 
American 
president, 

but to see a Black woman be the 
second most powerful person 
in 
the 
world, 
most 
people 

would say, it is almost surreal 
sometimes,” 
Williams 
said. 

“That representation and just 
(thinking) you could be there 
one day if you work hard and set 
those goals (is possible), because 
you now have that example of 
someone who is there.” 

Public Health junior Subarna 

Bhattacharya, a member of the 
Indian dance group Michigan 
Sahana, said this year’s election 
stuck with her and her family 
because they could relate to 

Harris.

“I 
definitely 
saw 
more 

engagement from my parents 
because 
there 
was 
someone 

similar to our identity on the 
ticket, so it was exciting to see 
my mom talk about what she read 
on the news,” Bhattacharya said. 

Bhattacharya 
said 
even 

though she disagreed with some 
choices Harris made as senator, 
she believes her appointment 

sets an important precedent and 
gives her hope for more women 
of color holding office in the 
future. 

“Even though I may not 

agree with a lot of the things 
Kamala Harris has done in her 
past political career, I do think 
that it is still a step forward 
(for Indian Americans) to see 
someone whose parents had 
similar immigrant experiences 

as ours and who was able to 
reach a platform this high,” 
Bhattacharya said. “I think she 
definitely has created a very 
strong name for herself and 
hearing her say ‘I may be the first 
but I won’t be the last’ is very 
momentous for me, because in 
the future when I have children 
and they mention Kamala Harris, 
by that time hopefully it will be 
a normal thing to see women of 

color in office.”

Bhattacharya’s 
hope 
that 

more women of color will enter 
political 
office 
was 
echoed 

in 
remarks 
made 
by 
Sen. 

Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., at 
Wednesday’s inauguration. In 
her speech, Klobuchar noted the 
significance of Harris’s role as 
the nation’s second in command.

“When she takes the oath 

of office, little girls and boys 
across the world will know that 
anything 
and 
everything 
is 

possible,” Klobuchar said. 

Michigan 
Gov. 
Gretchen 

Whitmer 
attended 
the 

inauguration 
with 
her 
two 

daughters. In an interview after 
the event, she said despite the 
restrictions placed on the event 
by the COVID-19 pandemic and 
recent security concerns, she 
“will never forget” seeing Harris 
sworn-in. 

“To 
see 
(Vice 
President) 

Harris take her oath of office 
and to be sitting with my two 
daughters as that happened is a 
moment that I will never forget,” 
Whitmer said.

Williams 
said 
she 
hopes 

the Biden administration will 
put more fuel into funding 
and 
supporting 
historically 

Black colleges and universities, 
something Biden has previously 
promised to do.

“It would be really awesome 

to see more of an initiative to 
fund HBCUs and get them onto 
the same level as universities 
like the University of Michigan 
when it comes to funding and 
resources,” Williams said. “It is 
something (Harris) could use her 
platform to do.” 

As Kamala Harris is sworn in as 
first woman of color VP, students 
reflect on historic inauguration

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
News
4 — Wednesday, January 27, 2021 

University 
of 
Michigan 

social 
media 
experts 
are 

studying 
the 
influence 
of 

social 
media 
over 
politics, 

particularly through the rapid 
spread of misinformation and 
increased 
access. 
According 

to these experts, social media 
played a pivotal role in the riot 
at the U.S. Capitol last week.

Sarita Schoenebeck, a School 

of 
Information 
associate 

professor, 
said 
former 

President 
Donald 
Trump’s 

presidency fueled the sharing 
of misinformation on social 
media by exploiting algorithms 
designed to reward content 
that’s popular, even if it’s fake 
or wrong.

“Clearly 
the 
election 
of 

President 
Trump 
increased 

divisiveness 
in 
the 
U.S., 

and that kind of alignment 
increased social media use 
and misinformation, so these 
things can’t be disentangled,” 
Schoenebeck said.

She 
said 
the 
future 

impact of large social media 
organizations banning Trump’s 
accounts is that more sites 
might take a second look at 
posts and filter out harassment. 
Following the Jan. 6 Capitol 
riots, multiple social media 
platforms — including Twitter, 
Instagram 
and 
Facebook 

— 
announced 
they 
were 

banning the former president’s 
accounts to prevent the further 
incitement of violence.

“I think the banning of 

President Trump was a reactive 

decision, it was too little too 
late,” Schoenebeck said. “But, 
it was the right decision given 
the violence and I think going 
forward sites need to consider 
people and the content they 
share in the broader context.” 

Josh Pasek, an associate 

professor 
of 
communication 

and media, said social media 
provides an opportunity to meet 
people with similar ideologies, 
resulting in incidences like 
joining together to attack the 
Capitol building.

“It makes it easier to do good 

things, and it makes it easier to 
do bad things,” Pasek said. “One 
clear role that social media had 
(in the riots) was in helping 
a group of people that might 
not otherwise find each other 
easily get more coordinated.” 

Because 
politicians 
and 

elected officials have more 
prominent 
platforms, 
Pasek 

said 
their 
endorsement 
of 

falsehoods 
helps 
further 

spread untrue information on 
social media. 

“In addition, you have an 

elite situation where a number 
of 
elites 
— 
in 
particular, 

the 
president 
— 
have 
not 

been 
particularly 
devoted 

to ensuring that the official 
information coming out was 
accurate,” Pasek said. “So the 
willingness of elites at various 
different levels to buy into the 
big lie that the election was 
stolen and that there was fraud 
and irregularities gives that 
claim more power and makes it 
far more pervasive.” 

Pasek 
also 
acknowledged 

the effects of the pandemic, 
saying it has led to many people 

wanting to take action at a time 
when they feel out of control 
and more dissociated from 
society than usual. 

LSA 
freshman 
Anna 

Wilentz, an attendee of the 
event, said she feels social 
media influences young voters’ 
opinions before they are able 
to fully process monumental 
political events in the country, 
such as the 2020 election and 
the Capitol riot.

“Social media has caused 

individuals to take their peers’ 
point of views on political 
issues, which prohibits them 
from 
forming 
their 
own 

educated opinions,” Wilentz 
said. “This is one factor that 
has led America to become 
more polarized, and has led to 
Americans speaking freely on 
social media and expressing 
extreme political beliefs and 
attitudes.”

With the constant evolution 

of social media, Cliff Lampe, 
a 
School 
of 
Information 

professor, discussed the major 
increase in the number of users 
on platforms over the past 
years. 

“I think the biggest change 

over time has been the number 
of types of people who have 
started using social media,” 
Lampe said. “As the population 
of use has grown, so has the role 
of social media in society. It’s 
easy to spread misinformation 
on social media because there 
are fewer gatekeepers.”

Historically, Lampe said the 

general 
population 
received 

their 
information 
from 

established news organizations, 

which have strict fact-checking 
procedures. 
With 
the 
rise 

of social media, Lampe said 
the media landscape is less 
regulated, which has resulted 
in quick and easy access to 
spreading false information.

“In 
a 
traditional 
mass 

media 
environment, 
there 

would be editors, and there 
was 100 years of development 
of 
professional 
journalistic 

practices that determined how 
you could tell if (information) 
was true or not,” Lampe said. 
“Social media does not have 
the same kind of gatekeepers 
and same kind of history that 
mass media does, so anybody 
can 
share 
anything. 
Social 

media also tends to flatten 
hierarchies, so there’s no such 

thing as expertise anymore.”

To 
fight 
misinformation 

and 
harassment 
online, 

Schoenebeck suggested social 
media sites carefully monitor 
a user’s collection of posts 
instead of evaluating posts 
individually. 
According 
to 

Schoenebeck, 
they 
should 

consider the information in 
the context of the person’s 
past history and the history of 
people who are targeted by the 
post. 

Pasek said he has debated 

whether social media is a 
completely negative influence 
in our society. While it has 
caused many problems, he said 
he believes it also has many 
positive effects.

“What’s become increasingly 

clear this year is that we’re 
still working on figuring out 
the right norms for how to 
deal with social media,” Pasek 
said. “The way it interacts with 
our psychology is something 
that makes that a particularly 
pressing question, because (we 
tend to believe) information is 
more credible when you hear 
it from friends than when you 
hear it from somebody who you 
don’t particularly know.”

Looking ahead, Lampe said it 

is a vital and monumental time 
for social media in our society 
because… . 

“It’s 
an 
interesting 
time 

for social media right now, 
especially 
as 
we 
see 
the 

platforms’ converging power,” 
Lampe said.

RESEARCH

U-M study reveals lack of coronavirus 
aid for Black-owned businesses

A 
national 
study 
on 

coronavirus 
aid 
for 
small 

businesses led by University of 
Michigan 
researchers 
found 

that Black business owners were 
about 30 times less likely to 
receive government assistance 
than white business owners 
since the pandemic began in 
March 2020. The study was 
led by Felix Kabo, an assistant 
research 
scientist 
at 
the 

Institute for Social Research’s 
Survey Research Center. 

In 
March 
2020, 
Congress 

passed the $2.2 trillion dollar 
coronavirus relief bill (known 
as the CARES Act) in an attempt 
to help working families, small 
businesses, people paying off 
loans and a health care system 
staggered by COVID-19. The 
bill gave over $600 billion to 
businesses, 
states 
and 
other 

municipalities 
without 
much 

instruction on how to distribute 
it, leaving workers unsure of how 
to collect unemployment benefits. 

The University’s study was 

nationally administered from 
May through June 2020 and 
surveyed approximately 6,300 
small 
business 
owners 
and 

entrepreneurs from around the 
country. The business owners 
were asked whether or not they 
had received government aid 
between March and May 2020. 
While 6.9% of the total number 
of 
entrepreneurs 
surveyed 

reported receiving federal aid, 
only 0.3% of Black entrepreneurs 
said they received money from 
the government. 

The study does not examine 

why this disparity between 
Black-owned 
and 
non-Black-

owned 
businesses 
occurred. 

However, in an interview with 
The Michigan Daily, Kabo said 
he suspected that pre-existing 
barriers and unequal access to 
credit might contribute to Black 
business owners struggling to 
receive funding. 

“I’ve looked at work that’s 

emerged 
that’s 
showing 
a 

phenomenon where business 
owners and entrepreneurs were 
much more likely to receive 
stimulus funds when they had 
pre-existing relationships with 
financial 
institutions,” 
Kabo 

said. “A Black business owner 
or entrepreneur is … less likely 
to get credit, and if they do, they 
are more likely to be charged 
higher interest.” 

Kabo 
said 
Black-owned 

businesses are often denied 
loans because they sometimes 
lack 
the 
financial 
and 

accounting structures necessary 
to receive, process and account 
for stimulus funds. 

Many 
Black 
business 

owners in Washtenaw County 
expressed similar frustrations 
with 
accessing 
financial 

relief due to bureaucratic and 
systemic obstacles. In the fall, a 
group of local business owners 
created 
the 
Association 
of 

Businesses of Color to provide 
aid to businesses run by people 
of color. 

Melvin Parson, the executive 

director of We the People 
Opportunity Farm, a nonprofit 
farm based in Ypsilanti that 
mainly 
employs 
formerly 

incarcerated individuals, said 
there are a lot of bureaucratic 
obstacles 
that 
grassroots 

organizations and nonprofits 
face when trying to receive 
grants. 

“The more you can cut out 

the bureaucracy, the better 
off things will be in terms of 
money getting to organizations 
that have the potential to really 
make an impact,” Parson said. 
“And (money won’t) just make 
it into the hands of the few 

organizations that are able to 
dot their i’s and cross their t’s.” 

Brian 
Jones-Chance, 

co-founder of the 734 Brewing 
Company in Ypsilanti and one 
of the founders of the ABC, 
said while he applied for and 
received Paycheck Protection 
Program 
loans 
as 
part 
of 

the CARES act, he has seen 
firsthand how many Black-
owned businesses struggle to 
access financial aid. Like Kabo 
said, the lack of relationships 
between Black business owners 
and financial institutions deters 
some 
businesses 
from 
even 

applying for aid, Jones-Chance 
said.

“We are finding that one of 

these issues is not having those 
banking relationships,” Jones-
Chance said. “You just go and 
you deposit your money, you 
maybe run your payroll through 
there, but there’s no actual 
personal relationship.” 

Other local Black business 

owners said they chose not 
to apply for coronavirus aid 
because 
they 
weren’t 
sure 

exactly what it entailed. Robyn 
McCoy, a partner at McCoy 
and Associates, a law firm in 
downtown 
Ann 
Arbor 
that 

specializes in estate and trust 
law, chose not to apply for 
the PPP because she found it 
unclear whether or not the 
program functioned as a loan or 
a grant. 

The PPP provided loans to 

small businesses during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, though it 
was initially unclear whether 
it would be classified as a grant 
or loan when filing taxes. The 
CARES Act, which the PPP is 
part of, also includes programs 
for small businesses grants, 
such as advance payments for 
the Economic Injury Disaster 
Loan program. 

In an email to The Daily, 

McCoy 
called 
for 
greater 

education on the state, local, 
and national levels to increase 
transparency in the aid process. 
 
 

“There 
were 
concerns 

because it was set up as a loan 
and I’m not eager to incur any 

more 
debt,” 
McCoy 
wrote. 

“I wouldn’t rule out possibly 
applying for something in the 
future, I would just want it to be 
clear — that if it’s a grant then it 
says it’s a grant.” 

Janice Johnson, the owner of 

Clothes Mentor Ann Arbor, said 
the responsibility of providing 
aid to small businesses should 
be shared by local, state and 
national 
governments. 
She 

said there were local grant 
opportunities that could have 
prevented her from having to 
use personal savings to pay 
her bills that were not well 
marketed.

“There were other grants 

available that I missed out 
on that have since expired,” 
Johnson said. “So even if Ann 
Arbor did handle it directly, how 
would they spread the news that 
these (grants) were available?”

Kabo 
proposed 
several 

solutions 
to 
the 
disparities 

between 
white 
and 
Black 

business owners’ access to aid. 
He 
said 
local 
governments 

in Pittsburgh and Cincinnati 
have 
begun 
initiatives 
to 

provide critical funding for 
debt financing, such as using 
government agencies to provide 
information 
to 
businesses 

owned by people of color. These 
strategies can be adopted in 
Ann Arbor and by other local 
governments across the country, 
Kabo said.

Music, Theatre & Dance 

freshman Maya Boyd, whose 
father owns Boyd Beauty in 
downtown Ann Arbor, said it 
was more important to support 
local Black-owned businesses 
rather 
than 
large-scale 

corporations. She encouraged 
U-M 
students 
to 
explore 

Black-owned 
businesses 

outside of campus and around 
Ann Arbor. 

“I think that students have 

a lot of knowledge on how to 
spread information and support 
people,” Boyd said. “(They can 
help) just by going and exploring 
other businesses that aren’t the 
classic white-owned businesses 
and corporations.”

Daily Arts Top Five: 

What to read, watch & 
listen to this weekend

Each week, Daily Arts writers evaluate 

the latest movies, shows, books, music, 

games and more. They watch, read and 

listen for the next standout artistic trends 

and then write about what that means 

for us in the art world and beyond. Come 

Friday, we highlight what Daily Arts 

loved most — here’s what will keep you 

captivated this weekend. 

— Zoe Phillips and Elise Godfryd, 

Managing Arts Editors 

Watch: “Pieces of a Woman”

In her review for the Daily, Daily 

Arts Writer Mary Elizabeth Johnson 

commends the new Netflix film release 

“Pieces of a Woman” for its willingness 

to explore one woman’s experience of 

motherhood in a way that doesn’t shy 

away from the “often overlooked parts” 

of it. The film approaches pregnancy, 

childbirth and the post-partum period 

with empathy, honesty and openness. 

Though the film’s reception has been 

somewhat polarized, Johnson promises 

“it’ll make you want to call your mom, 

check up on her and thank her.” 

Listen to: Two Saviors

Two Saviors, Buck Meek’s new 

album, is, in the words of Daily Arts 

Writer Rosa Sofia Kaminski, “like a love 

letter written upon waking up from a 

dream.” With this collection of songs, 

the Big Thief guitarist has created a 

breakup album that is as melancholy 

as it is danceable. Two Saviors, “tinged 

with sadness” and “suffused with light” 

all at once, considers large, universal 

themes like nostalgia and sadness 

through a “loving observation” of the 

small things. 

Read: “On the Way Out, Turn Off the 

Light” by Marge Piercy

In her review for The Daily, writer 

Emilia 
Ferrante 
describes 
Marge 

Piercy’s poetry as boldly introspective. 

The collection meditates on love 

and loss, sex and politics, family and 

religion. Within each, Ferrante notes 

that Piercy’s writing “thrives in small 

sentences and phrases.” The result is a 

book of poems that deserves to be kept 

close by, available for revisiting when in 

need of comfort. It is, as Ferrante writes, 

“like a friend giving gentle advice” — a 

carefully arranged collection of words 

that “most people screaming into the 

void can’t express.” 

Watch: “WandaVision”

“WandaVision,” the latest Disney+ 

endeavor into the Marvel Cinematic 

Universe, is, according to Daily Arts 

Writer Jessica Curney, a solid and 

exciting beginning to Phase Four of 

the Marvel franchise. The TV series 

examines what happened to Wanda 

Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen, “Sorry For 

Your Loss”) and Vision (Paul Bettany, 

“Uncle Frank”) after the explosive 

events of 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame.” 

Curney assures us that any viewer, 

regardless of their experience with 

Marvel, can enjoy the “wild ride” that is 

“WandaVision.”

When we think of what defines 

good art, nationality and language 
are generally not the first factors 
that come to mind. Yet, in reality, 
the celebration of the arts is often 
heavily influenced by outdated ideas 
dictating what stories are deserving 
of recognition. 

The British-Japanese pop singer 

Rina Sawayama stands as one 
of the clearest examples of this 
phenomenon. When BRITs and the 
Mercury prize were released back 
in July, the 30-year-old musician’s 
critically-acclaimed 
album, 

SAWAYAMA, 
was 
noticeably 

missing from the lineup. Sawayama 
sat down with Vice following the 
news, describing her exclusion 
from nominations, and even the 
possibility to enter for consideration, 
as “othering.” Despite having lived 
in London for 25 years, Sawayama 
was not considered “British enough” 
according 
to 
stringent 
award 

guidelines, ones that she labeled as 
“border control.” 

Sawayama was born in Niigata, 

Japan, where she lived for five years 
before moving with her family to 

London. She currently holds an 
indefinite-leave-to-remain 
visa, 

which grants Sawayama stay in the 
U.K. for an indefinite period of time 
and allows her to study and seek 
employment. Most of Sawayama’s 
family still lives in Japan, one of 
the few countries that prohibits 
dual-citizenship. She explains that 
“getting rid of my Japanese passport 
genuinely feels like I’m severing 
ties with them.” The situation 
shines light on a flawed definition 
of Britishness and the persistent 
view that non-European voices are 
unwelcome in British culture. 

But it’s not just a British issue; 

the Grammys are notorious for 
excluding Latin and other foreign 
language albums from their Album 
of the Year nominations. An album 
in a language other than English 
has never won Album of the Year, 
and for 2021 alone, there are only 
two nominations for Latin artists 
outside of the Latin categories. It’s 
yet another explicit example of 
the music industry’s tendency to 
pigeonhole foreign talents. 

The 
recently 
released 
film 

“Minari” (2020), which follows the 
story of a Korean-American family 
living in rural Arkansas, faces a 
similar barrier. Although “Minari” 

was directed by American filmmaker 
Lee Isaac Chung and produced 
by American companies A24 and 
Plan B, the film was categorized 
as a foreign language film in the 
Golden Globes by the Hollywood 
Foreign Press Association. The 
HFPA guidelines stipulate that a 
film’s dialogue must be at least 50% 
English to be considered for Best 
Picture 
nominations. 
“Minari,” 

which features both Korean and 
English dialogue, as well as Korean 
and 
Korean-American 
talents, 

apparently didn’t make the cut. 

This exclusion comes on the 

tails of two similar cases at last 
year’s Golden Globes. The Oscar-
winning film “Parasite” (2019), 
which was entirely in Korean, and 
“The Farewell” (2019), a film with 
both English and Chinese dialogue, 
were also ineligible for Best Picture 
nominations 
despite 
receiving 

overwhelmingly positive reviews 
from critics. Lulu Wang, director 
of “The Farewell,” tweeted in 
response to this year’s Golden Globe 
nominations, “I have not seen a more 
American film than #Minari this 
year. It’s a story about an immigrant 
family, IN America, pursuing the 
American dream. We really need 
to change these antiquated rules 

that characterize American as 
only English-speaking.” So often in 
American pop culture immigrant 
stories, especially those of people 
of color, are labeled as outsider 
experiences despite their central 
importance 
to 
the 
American 

identity. So, is the only requirement 
for artistic recognition to speak 
English? 

As 
evident 
from 
past 
Best 

Picture nominations at the Globes, 
it’s not that simple. The 2009 film 
“Inglourious 
Basterds,” 
which 

prominently 
features 
dialogue 

in German, French and Italian, 
was nominated in the Best Drama 
category despite large portions of 
its story transpiring in a language 
other than English. Many of its stars, 
including Christoph Waltz, Mélanie 
Laurent and Diane Kruger, are not 
American, calling into question 
why “Inglourious Basterds” and 
“Minari” have faced such different 
treatment 
despite 
their 
many 

commonalities. 

The problem that remains is that 

works in the Foreign Language 
category do not receive nearly as 
much attention as those in the 
Best Drama or Musical/Comedy 
categories. The Golden Globes in 
particular nominate Best Actors 
and Actresses exclusively from 
these two groups, nominations 
which are not afforded to actors 
in foreign language films. They’re 
treated as an afterthought — never 
truly equivalent to their “domestic” 
counterparts. It’s disheartening, to 
say the least. 

The experiences of Sawayama 

and 
“Minari” 
point 
to 
an 

overarching issue with xenophobic 
microaggressions in Western pop 
culture. When the recognition of 
art is overshadowed by arbitrary 
percentages and passport statuses, 
it is abundantly clear that English-
speaking cultures are still unwilling 
to view foreign works as equal. 
These works are often placed inside 
the box of their “foreignness” and 
treated as some kind of novelty, a 
completely separate entity from 
mainstream American or British art. 

It is difficult to imagine 

myself on the path I might be on 
had I not read the books I have 
read. I have often heard about 
“the moral of the story,” but life 
is rarely so straightforward. 
Few stories have a lesson, but 
every story can be learned 
from. In lieu of a dissertation 
on 
one 
book, 
expounding 

interpretations 
pulled 
from 

subtext so deep it may as well 
be imagined, here is a tour of a 
few subtler points I have picked 
up on a problematic and elusive 
topic: consciousness. 

Picture: The sun is setting 

behind my childhood home. I 
am sitting with my back against 
the window facing southwest. 
I look up from my book to see 
delicate yellow light on the wall 
and turn around to see a heavy 
gold pouring through the trees. 
I realize that the sun will set 
tomorrow, but that I will not 
be here for that sunset. I will 
be somewhere else. Basic facts, 
invincible tenets of life emerge: 
The sun rises and sets every day. 
The setting sun will light up this 
room tomorrow + I will not be in 
this room tomorrow = I will not 
see the setting sun light up this 
room tomorrow. 

This seems like a pretty 

obvious observation, but the 
difference is that I can still 
picture myself sitting on that 
couch, 
watching 
the 
light 

change. It won’t happen, but 
I can see it as clearly as I see 
myself in that room as my 
mind wanders through this 
line of thought. I can also see 
myself sitting at my desk in 
my apartment in Ann Arbor, 
watching an entirely different 
version of the same sunset. 
Initial 
circumstances 
entail 

conclusions.

I’m thinking in this strange, 

almost 
mathematical 
way 

because at the moment I am 
reading a stunning short story 

called “Story of Your Life” by Ted 
Chiang, the basis for the movie 
“Arrival.” In the story, aliens 
land on earth and the narrator, a 
linguist named Louise, is tasked 
with communicating with them.

As Louise learns the aliens’ 

language, she begins to see 
time differently. The aliens 
perceive 
time 
non-linearly 

— they view their entire life 
simultaneously, each moment 
a predetermined scene in a 
play. As Louise becomes more 
proficient in the alien language, 
she gains memories of her 
future. The reader gradually 
comes to understand that the 
memories are not presented 
in the expected chronological 
order, despite Chiang using the 
present and future tense to relay 
them. As the reader learns about 
the unique abilities provided by 
the alien language, they realize 
that the perceived past is really 
the future. The use of tense 
makes perfect sense.

“Story of Your Life” has an 

almost magical effect on the 
reader — it feels as though 
Chiang has broken a secret 
rule of storytelling, that of 
chronology. But this technical 
rebellion is perfectly welcome, 
as it brings me to that delicious 
event we all hope for in a book: 
the “a-ha!” moment. 

Great stories spark novel 

thoughts 
in 
their 
readers. 

The iconic quote from Dr. 
Ian 
Malcolm 
in 
“Jurassic 

Park” springs to mind: “Your 
scientists were so preoccupied 
with whether or not they could, 
they didn’t stop to think if they 
should.” Hearing this delivered 
in Jeff Goldblum’s impeccably 
stuttered 
cadence 
prompts 

legitimate consideration: How 
should we treat bioengineered 
animals? It seems like a distant 
question, one that our great-
great-grandchildren will face, 
not us. And while we may not 
resurrect 
dinosaurs 
anytime 

soon, 
Michael 
Crichton’s 

original “Jurassic Park” novel 
does raise relevant questions 

regarding 
consciousness 
and 

life.

Consider the velociraptor, a 

creature artificially created by 
geneticists in “Jurassic Park.” 
Does it have rights? Should 
we protect it, or let it roam 
free? The point that Crichton 
emphasizes in the novel is 
that nature can never truly be 
controlled, that life will escape 
any cage, will “find a way.” 
But when we do play God and 
create an animal, there is an 
undeniable implication: that we 
owe our offspring protection. 

Creation is paternal in the 

world of “Jurassic Park,” yet 
protection necessitates a certain 
amount of control. However, 
if we can never control nature, 
then it follows that we can never 
truly protect it. Crichton asks 
us to question our treatment of 
animals, an issue that is further 
complicated when we consider 
the role of consciousness in 
other forms of life.

But 
how 
about 
another 

perspective, 
one 
where 
an 

animal is not created, but 
altered? In Stephen Baxter’s 
novel 
“Manifold 
Time,” 

scientists send a rocket to 
examine an alien object that has 
appeared in the solar system. 
It’s a one-way trip, so they 
can’t send a human to pilot the 
vessel. They opt instead for a 
non-traditional pilot: Sheena 5, 
a squid, biologically enhanced 
to have the intelligence of a 
human. Sheena can control the 
rocket, perform all the scientific 
functions necessary and inhabit 
a much smaller space than a 
human. 

This seems like a perfect 

solution, one that eliminates 
a loss of human life while 
mimicking 
the 
creative 

problem-solving abilities of a 
conscious person. But of course, 
if Sheena is conscious, then isn’t 
sending her on a suicide mission 
just as immoral as sending a 
human? To further complicate 
things, Sheena is — unknown 
to the scientists — pregnant 

when she begins her voyage. 
Her 
offspring 
inherit 
her 

mental abilities, and a family 
of newly-conscious beings is 
created. The story unfolds like 
a logical extension of “Jurassic 
Park” 
as 
the 
squids 
find 

ways to survive in space and 
eventually reproduce to form a 
generational society. 

Reading “Manifold Time” led 

me to unexpected emotional 
leaps; I began to consider a 
squid the same way I would 
consider 
a 
person. 
Sheena 

thinks in the same internal 
monologue as myself, she feels 
the same fear of death that I 
feel and she turns out to be very 
similar to any other person, 
with the exception of certain 
tentacular 
differences. 
She 

leads me to wonder, is the gap 
between people and animals 
really all that big?

Stephen 
Godfrey-Smith’s 

newest 
book 
“Metazoa” 

explores this topic in the same 
way that Sheena explores the 
solar system. Both a philosopher 
and 
a 
biologist, 
Godfrey-

Smith 
observes 
animals 

the 
way 
an 
anthropologist 

observes humans. He describes 
encounters 
with 
octopuses 

and 
shrimp 
like 
they’re 

simply other people, as if the 
difference in species is no more 
than a language barrier. One 
passage stuck out to me: “Two 
weeks later I went back again, 
implausible as it seemed to be 
driving three hours up the coast 
to visit a shrimp … He looked 
tired, very much on his own, 
and probably near the end of his 
days.”

What Godfrey-Smith seeks 

to prove in “Metazoa” is that 
consciousness 
cannot 
be 

strictly delineated. It’s not as if 
there is a switch, as if the lights 
are on in one animal and off in 
another. More complex animals 
like 
octopuses, 
dolphins 
or 

house 
cats 
certainly 
feel 

emotions similar to ours. They 
also form memories the way we 
do, remembering locations and 
routes and feelings associated 
with different places. Most 
importantly, they use language.

There was a moment over 

winter break when I sat in my 
living room and my family’s 
cat, Lily, started pawing at 
the door, wanting to be let in. 
She saw me stand up through 
the glass, and when I walked 
over 
she 
stopped 
pawing, 

looked at me and meowed. It 
wasn’t an empty utterance, 

there was an intention behind 
it, a conveyance of meaning: 
Open the door, Julian. In that 
moment, it certainly seemed 
that 
there 
was 
something 

behind her eyes that resembled 
my own consciousness.

But then the moment was 

over, and I sat back down and 
picked up my book, which 
brings us back to “Story of Your 
Life.” The other books I’ve 
mentioned here all brought me 
to think about consciousness 
differently in other beings, in 
animals. 

But “Story of Your Life” 

brought me to think differently 
about my own mind. I saw 
tomorrow as something half-
certain, as if today were a 
snapshot of a ball, just released 
from a hand, waiting to fall. I 
couldn’t tell exactly, but some 
present information entailed 
some future events. The sun will 
set, the room will glow, I will be 
there or I will be somewhere 
else. Fill in that last blank, and 
the future is not all that hard to 
see in my mind. 

It’s a little thing, a tilt of the 

lens rather than a full pan, but 
it’s important. Stories make us 
think; great stories change the 
way we think.

Dreams submerge one into an 

altered state of consciousness. So does 
music. The two become one in Two 
Saviors, Buck Meek’s new album. 
It is tinged with sadness and regret 
but suffused with light. Steeped in 
nostalgia and setting, Meek invites 
you into a slice of his memory. The 
album feels like a love letter written 
upon waking up from a dream: a 
little confused, a little unclear in its 
language but thoughtfully done — that 
is, if it is not the dream itself.

The Big Thief member’s solo album 

begins with a daydream. “Pareidolia” 
is a breath of summer on an album 
released in the dead of winter. It is 
a vessel filled with clouds, a finger 
trailed lazily over a lover’s skin. 
Literally, “Pareidolia” is defined as the 
phenomenon of finding myths and 

patterns in random stimuli, like seeing 
figures in the clouds. These stories 
we seek to find in the accidental 
nature of our lives, this search for 
meaning, is compressed here into 
a relaxed love song. Like the rest of 
the album, it is not eager to explore 
complicated, profound ideas. It does 
not desire purpose on an intellectual 
level. Instead, it finds purpose in all 
the small, human patterns of everyday 
life. Purpose is found through a loving 
observation of the details.

Details are what give this album 

personality. Lines like “Thank God 
for coffee / and apple pie” from 
“Pocketknife” and “Well, did your 
eyes change? I remember them blue 
/ or were they always hazel?” from 
“Candle” and all the specific names on 
“Cannonball! Pt. 2” welcome you into 
Meek’s world, one filled with birds 
and guitar twinges.

Although the lyrics are difficult 

to understand at times, Meek does 

a good job convincing the listener 
that this is due to their highly 
personal, interpretive nature, rather 
than a failure on his part to fully 
communicate his meaning. He tends 
to write with snippets of images, 
leaving the listener to sew together a 
quilt of meaning from them, allowing 
each person to adapt the images to fit 
into their own lives. 

Nostalgia and sadness are universal 

experiences. Meek, using these as 
his tools of empathy, does not write 
explicitly. That is, he does not force 
the listener to interpret his work in a 
certain way. Tunes such as “Dream 
Daughter” and “Two Saviors” drift 
in the lukewarm lake of memory, 
addressing someone directly. It feels 
like a photograph in which the subject 
smiles radiantly at the person behind 
the camera.

6 — Wednesday, January 27, 2021

After the past year, the phrase 

“these unprecedented times” and 
the nonstop messages of “we will get 
through this” have become, quite 
frankly, annoying. Yes, we know that 
pandemics are unpredictable, but 
these seemingly heartfelt remarks are 
constant reminders of our complete 
lack of control. They prompt us to 
question if our life and our time serve 
any greater purpose. 

Now, imagine if you have all the 

time in the world and a never-ending 
life. How would you spend your life? 
How would you use your time? “The 
Invisible Life of Addie La Rue,” a book 
by V.E. Schwab, follows the story of 
Addie and her 300-year struggle to “be 
remembered” and define her legacy. 
Desperate to escape a mundane, 
passionless existence in 1700s France, 
a young and naive Addie makes a 
deal with a dark, mysterious god for 
freedom and time. No deal, however, 
comes without a price. Though Addie 
will live forever, no one will remember 
her. 

Soon after making her deal, Addie 

realizes that her life is meaningless 
without anyone to remember her. She 
cleverly finds a way to leave behind 
a legacy, influencing artists and 
their works. These artists attempt to 
illustrate and bring to life a mysterious 
female presence whom they can’t 
quite put their finger on. Of course, 
art is timeless, everlasting pieces of 
culture and conversation. 

So, Addie goes through the years, 

living as a ghost and spending her 
nights with lovers, only for them 
to forget her in the morning. She 
whispers into the souls of artists, 
writers and musicians, causing them 
to embody her in their work. She lives 
like this until she meets Henry, who 
remembers her.

Her entanglement with Henry is a 

beautiful love story — a boy and girl 
who find what they long for in each 
other. Henry’s history is tumultuous, 
highlighting the contrast between 
love and validation. He struggles 
to find emotional balance and 
satisfaction with his friendships, 
family and romantic partners, going 
through life without a solid anchor 
or purpose. When he meets Addie, he 
is able to journey towards emotional 
balance, learning what satisfaction 
and contentment with one’s self truly 
entails. For Addie, she is finally able 
to find someone who remembers her 
for everything she is. For a moment, 
everything is perfect, our characters 
living in bliss. Then, things go awry 
and Addie has to make a difficult 
decision. The ending leaves readers 
guessing and questioning if what they 
read was a love story, or something 
else. 

Having read some of V.E. Schwab’s 

previous works, I was confused by 
the focus on emotional character 
exploration and the “coming of age” 
vibe to the chapters leading up to the 
climax. “A Darker Shade of Magic” 
and her other series attempt to analyze 
themes such as morality, justice and 
human desires. But it all clicked when 
I read the last chapter. The ending 

reaffirmed Schwab’s trademark style 
and changed my interpretation of the 
book drastically. 

The prose is full of figurative 

language and allegories. The flowery 
descriptions are so vivid, you can see 
the years falling like leaves. I was very 
suspicious of the writing, however, 
almost as if the author specifically 
chose to write so elegantly to give 
readers the wrong impression. If you 
look past the allure of the language, 
you might uncover a different story. 

Addie sought to leave a legacy for 

herself, for people to remember her 
name. She took the company of artists, 
writers and musicians at night, letting 
them immortalize her in their art. 
When the fog clears, I see a character 
struggling between validation in the 
eyes of others and oneself. Like the 
language, art is often used as a symbol 
of the more alluring attractions and 
superficial desires of the world. Addie 
chose to create her legacy through 
superficial means. 

When she finally does meet 

someone who remembers her, the 
emotional journey that ensues results 
in character growth for one, but does 
it change the other?

The blurring of dreams and 
reality: Buck Meek’s ‘Two 
Saviors’ dives into memory

“One Night in Miami” 

brings icons to life

What would Malcolm X, Sam Cooke, 

Muhammad Ali and Jim Brown say to 

one another?

While this sounds like the prompt 

for a history essay, the movie “One 

Night in Miami” imagines these 

icons meeting on the 1964 February 

evening that Cassius Clay, later known 

as Muhammad Ali, became a world 

boxing champion.

Based on the 2013 play of the same 

name, it’s almost impossible to believe 

that this is Regina King’s (“Watchmen”) 

directorial debut. Using every cinematic 

tool to her advantage, she brings 1964 to 

Technicolor life with evocative staging, 

fitting musical choices (the song 

“Blowin’ in The Wind” is a highlight) 

and reimagined historical imagery.

The film starts off with Ali fighting 

an Englishman in Liverpool, where the 

almost completely Caucasian crowd is 

uniformly hostile. This sense of conflict 

is threaded through the next three 

introductory scenes, as Sam Cooke 

performs at a glitzy, sneering L.A. venue; 

a Southern elite patronizes Jim Brown 

and Malcolm X agonizes over leaving 

the Nation of Islam and threats to his 

family.

“One Night in Miami” sets the 

historical stage through character, 

rather than relying on setting. This 

makes the ensuing character-focused 

story all the more thrilling because 

the audience understands on an 

emotional level what the four icons 

are up against in a white-dominated 

America.

It is difficult enough bringing 

one momentous historical figure 

to the screen, let alone four. Yet 

the cast of “One Night in Miami” 

makes it look easy. The men are 

humanized enough to be relatable 

as characters, but they also bring 

history to blazing life when it’s right 

for the story — Malcolm X geeks 

out over his new camera and, just 

a few scenes later, exclaims “we’re 

fighting for our lives” in a furious 

cadence that feels like watching the 

man himself.

While both Aldis Hodge’s (“The 

Invisible Man”) Jim Brown and Eli 

Goree’s 
(“Riverdale”) 
Muhammad 

Ali are utterly convincing, Kingsley 

Ben-Adir’s (“The OA”) Malcolm X and 

Leslie Odom Jr.’s (“Hamilton”) Sam 

Cooke eclipse the other two characters. 

Throughout the night, Malcolm X and 

Sam Cooke draw one another into an 

intensifying conflict over their views on 

America. Malcolm X is appropriately 

severe in his outlook, pushing Cooke 

to stop singing love songs and to start 

fighting for social change. Cooke calls 

out Malcolm X for demonizing people 

who, in his view, could be won over 

through song. Muhammad Ali and Jim 

Brown try and put out the fires.

Since Kemp Powers, playwright 

and screenwriter of the original 

play and now the film, the movie 

sticks closely to its theatrical roots. 

Most of the narrative takes place 

inside a motel room, where the four 

characters 
converse 
about 
their 

historical moment and what it meant 

to be a Black celebrity in 1964. For a 

2021 audience, the themes explored 

concerning 
race 
and 
American 

oppression are arrestingly relevant. 

However, since the bulk of the movie 

takes place in one room, with everyone 

talking almost non-stop, even the 

best-acted and most well-written 

conversations begin to drag.

Thankfully, whenever “One Night in 

Miami” begins to lose its momentum, 

an emotional moment or a cutaway 

rips one’s attention back. The restraint 

in setting and plot, while occasionally 

one-note, gives the scenes of excitement 

a sublime air, like Muhammad Ali 

pulverizing a boxing opponent or Sam 

Cooke performing to a crowd that 

explodes with joy.

“One Night in Miami” is a thrilling 

piece of historical imagination with 

great performances, and establishes 

Regina King as a director to watch.

La Rue:” darkness, time and 

contentment

Those 
familiar 
with 
Samuel 

Beckett’s magnum opus, “Waiting for 
Godot” will immediately recognize 
the dramatic setting presented in 
Antoinette 
Nwandu’s 
absurdist 

tragedy “Pass Over.” Set “now, right 
now / but also 1855 / but also 13th 
century BCE,” the radio play features 
two men standing, eating, talking 
about nothing in particular and 
awaiting something that never comes 
to pass. Nwandu, however, adds a 
pivotal new dimension to the theatre 
of the absurd through his integration 
of the poignant and painfully relevant 
realities of racism and police brutality.

We the PROUD, We the People 

Representing 
Our 
Unifying 

Diversity Polycultural Productions, 
is 
a 
polycultural 
student 

organization here at the University. 
Their radio play “Pass Over,” 
presented via YouTube, serves as 
the final product of a semester-long 
investigation into the play, primarily 
focusing on the themes of police 
brutality, racism and the importance 
of everyday Black narratives. School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance senior 
Miguel Aviles-Elrod and LSA senior 
Bryce Foley star as both Moses and 
Kitch, switching roles from night 
to night to accurately encapsulate 
the multitudes their respective 
characters contain. 

The play opens with Moses and 

Kitch standing on the block of an 
unnamed ghetto, from which they 
hope to escape. The two are shown 
counting the ten wishes they will 

receive when they “pass over” into 
the promised land. This grocery 
list of dreams spans everything 
from collard greens and pinto 
beans to the return of a brother 
from the dead. 

Their shared dream of getting 

off of the block is inextricably 
intertwined with an ever-looming 

fear of death, which Nwandu 
illustrates through the constant 
surveillance of the “po-po,” or 
police, who were responsible for the 
murders of dozens of Kitch and Mo’s 
friends.

Memories of my dad watching golf 

(or napping through it) go back as 
long as I can remember. He brought 
me and my brother to driving ranges 
since we were little and that “fore!” 
means duck. He’s shown us how to 
hit out of a sand trap. Yet, he’s never 
been a fan of Tiger Woods. In fact, 
he admits that he usually cheered 
against him. But despite all of this, 
through every point of the man’s 
career, through the record-shattering 
highs and the gut-punching lows, my 
dad has maintained the same mantra: 

“Golf is more exciting when Tiger’s 

on the green.”

The sentiment rings true in the 

two-part, HBO Max documentary 
“Tiger.” No matter the shortcomings 
of the filmmakers, delving into the 
sometimes admirable, and often 
controversial, life of Tiger Woods can 
never be anything short of fascinating. 

At a time when many of the clubs 

didn’t even allow Black people on 
the course, Tiger ripped through 
old Masters like they were children. 
In a sport known for its quiet 
meticulousness, 
Tiger 
pummeled 

his competition with vigor. He was 
the first and only golfer to become a 
pop culture icon, and the world could 
not get enough of him. In the eyes 
of his best friend and former Green 
Beret father Earl Woods, Tiger was a 
God-like prophet sent down to unite 
humankind. Of course, according 
to the documentary, these absurd 
expectations are precisely what led to 
his downfall. 

The end of the first part teases an 

interview appearance from Rachel 
Uchitel, a woman who has unfairly 
come to be known by the world 
for one thing and one thing only: 
Tiger’s mistress. From here on out, 
the series picks up, and it picks up 
quickly. 

Part two begins with the first 

rumors of Tiger’s infidelity and 
follows him through all of his vices, 
poor decisions and the over-the-
top backlash he received for it. It 
notes that with just about every 
Tiger Woods cheating scandal, the 
women involved never described the 

encounters as casual. Many of them 
loved Tiger, and most felt he loved 
them back. 

As the documentary clearly frames 

it, Tiger didn’t simply go out and 
have sex. This was a tortured man, 
and he needed help. At all points of 
the episode, the filmmakers remain 
empathetic to Tiger, his ex-wife Elin 
and even the mistresses — an aspect 
I really appreciated. Many women 
have been relentlessly crucified and 
slut-shamed for being with Tiger. 
Elin specifically was unable to escape 
paparazzi following the controversy. 

It’s important to note that there 

doesn’t have to be a single “bad guy” in 
the story. We can remain empathetic 
to 
Tiger’s 
uniquely 
difficult 

upbringing while having sympathy 
for those he hurt. Or, at the very least, 
that’s what the documentary tries to 
show us.

But as interesting as “Tiger” 

can be, it is certainly not the most 
impartial. The documentary feels 
both too neat and too superficial 
to tell this story with justice. 
Relying primarily on the word 
of ex-girlfriends and former best 
friends, the series has moments 
that feel blatantly gossipy. For a 
project that often criticizes the 
way Tiger had his life forced upon 
him without his say, it feels pretty 
hypocritical to watch it do just 
that.

Based on the book of the same 

name, it’s clear that the people 
behind this knew exactly the story 
they wanted to tell. There’s no 
input from Tiger himself, nor from 
anyone who remains close with 
him today. Interview footage is 
often used to supplement the pre-
crafted ideas and guesses that old 
acquaintances have speculated, 
rather 
than 
to 
challenge 
or 

enrich them. In other words, it’s 
uninventive filmmaking. And at its 
worst, cheap journalism. 

Nonetheless, it’s exciting. Because 

at the end of the day, Tiger Woods 
is exciting. He’s an athlete unlike 
any other in history, and his story 
is so ripe with debate, it’s nearly 
impossible to not be intrigued. 
“Tiger” is a compelling guess at a 
man who lived a life like no other. I 
just want more. 

Regardless of what’s been going 

on in the outside world, 2020 was a 
pretty major year for games. “Animal 
Crossing: New Horizons” came out at 
the perfect time to help everyone get 
through the start of lockdown (check 
out The Daily’s Dylan Yono’s coverage 
here), Sony dominated the summer 
with the one-two punch release of 
“The Last of Us Part II” and “Ghost of 
Tsushima” and the next PlayStation 
generation began with a running start 
just last month. 

Despite the great games released, 

I didn’t expect to fall in love with not 
one but two games centered around 
Greek mythology. 

I love Greek myths. I spent 

my childhood buried in “Percy 
Jackson” novels and will steadfastly 
tell you I am a child of Athena. So I 
felt blessed by the gods when two 
high-profile, polished but vastly 
different games came out within 
months of each other. 

“Hades” by Supergiant Games 

concerns itself with Zagreus, the child 
of Hades and Persephone, as he tries 
to escape from the Underworld to 
find his mother. He can choose one 
of six powerful weapons to fight his 
way through the demon soldiers that 
inhabit Hades. (Note: Hades is both 
the name of the god of the dead and 
his realm — it’s confusing, I know.) 
When you die — and hoo-boy will you 

die often — you get sent back to the 
start to try again. 

No run is ever the same: Each 

room, enemy and treasure are chosen 
at random. The gods may assist you, 
but the game relies on skill, so the 
more you play, the better you get and 
the more you can upgrade Zagreus 
and go further before you die again. 
Tie this addicting gameplay loop with 
a thoughtful, carefully paced story in 
a world full of compelling characters, 
and you come out with something that 
many are calling Game of the Year 
material. 

Oh my god this game is good. I was 

obsessed with “Hades” for a good 
two months and I know that I will be 
revisiting the land of the dead as soon 
as I’m finished writing this article.

One important thing to note about 

the game is that it sets out to decolonize 
Greek history and mythology. It is 
admittedly silly to believe that the 
ancient Greeks were as white-bread 
as modern entertainment portrays 
them — Greece was a sailing society 
smack dab in the middle of the 
Mediterranean, indicating a darker 
skin tone like their Italian neighbors. 
Supergiant Games set out to present 
the gods as a much more diverse, and 
frankly attractive, group of immortal 
beings. I truly believe it is impossible to 
view the portrait work of this game and 
not come out crushing on at least one 
character. The writing also elevates 
these static (but again, beautiful) 
portraits into complex, entertaining 
characters brimming with personality. 

“Hades” is a wonderful first step in 

the direction of retracting the white-
washing of history, and hopefully 
sets a precedent within the games 
industry as a whole going forward. 

Another game, “Immortals Fenyx 

Rising,” from the team at Ubisoft 
Quebec, is much more standard, 
which is by no means a bad thing. 
Typhon the Titan has arisen once 
again and captured all the gods, so 
Zeus turns to Prometheus for help. 
Prometheus offers help, but only if 
the hero he creates fails. Thus, players 
get to create and control the titular 
Fenyx as they try to rescue the gods 
of Olympus and defeat Typhon. As 
soon as players are off the leash, the 
entirety of the Golden Isles is at their 
disposal. 

Do you want to save Aphrodite 

first? Or maybe Ares or Athena and 
oh, what’s this chest doing here? The 
world of “Immortals Fenyx Rising” is 
littered with enemies to fight, goodies 
to collect and vaults of Tartarus 
— essentially bite-sized themed 
dungeons — to explore. 

The exploration often feels great; 

being able to climb anything or glide 
anywhere helps make traversing the 
rather large world an easier task than 
it initially seems. 

Possibly the best part of the game is 

its comedic tone. Whether it’s Hermes 
and Aphrodite gossiping about the 
clothing of the other gods or Zeus 
and Prometheus bickering over the 
exact way an event happened, the 
game is full of laughs. However, that’s 

not to say everything is a joke. I was 
happily surprised to find moments of 
sincerity and self-reflection mixed in 
with the light tone. Ten hours deep 
into the game, I was just getting to the 
second exploration area, so I can say 
I was thoroughly enjoying my romp 
through the Golden Isles.

The comparison between how the 

two games use specific characters is 
interesting to examine. In “Hades,” 
Achilles is a friend and mentor to 
Zagreus, providing him with the 
weapons needed to help slay the 
hordes of the underworld. Achilles is 
compassionate, slightly reserved and 
holds a mysterious past, bristling at 
the mention of his former friend and 
probable lover Patroclus. 

Conversely, in “Immortals,” 

Achilles is a wraith, one of four 
great heroes who failed to stop 
Typhon and has been corrupted 
into serving the Titan. He haunts 
the land, a literal shadow of his 
former self and is another thing 
for Fenyx to help set right on their 
path to save the gods. The Greeks 
gods’ 
characterizations 
also 

have interesting similarities and 
differences, always benefitting 
the tone and story of the game 
they are in. Much like Arachne, 
the 
gifted 
weaver 
in 
Greek 

mythology, the developers took 
the same starting material and 
weaved two startlingly different 
tapestries. 

“Hades” and “Immortals Fenyx 

Rising” are two sides of the same 
drachma: the former using its 
Greek mythology for a story driven 
rogue-lite and the latter for open-
world checklist game that Ubisoft 
is known for. These two approaches 
are nothing alike beyond their 
shared mythos. “Hades” limits 
player exploration in favor of 
randomly generated maps, skill-
based combat and a slowly doled 
out story, while in “Immortals” 
the player can go anywhere, climb 
anything and do whatever their 
demi-god heart desires. 

‘Tiger’ is a cheap, but 

riveting, guess at the world’s 

most sensational golfer

A love letter to my nose

With your defined curve, a 

bump at the bridge followed 
by a downward plunge, you 
took over my face, never 
fitting into what I thought 
was beautiful. All around me 
were those cute button noses, 
slender with a gentle slope 
into a neat point. Even now, 
as I assess men, my eyes zero 
in on their noses, my mind 
telling me my future children 
deserve a chance to inherit a 
nose they’ll love. 

I look in a mirror and my 

hand immediately migrates to 

your tip, index finger pushing 
up gently and wondering “what 
if?” — the same hand whose 
thumb hovers over Snapchat 
stories of ‘non-surgical nose 
jobs’ whenever they (quite 
targetedly) show up on my 
feed. I often joke with my 
mom, cursing her for the genes 
that plopped you on my face.

My mother — who has an 

identical copy of you on her 
face, adorned with a light 
dusting of freckles. When 
have I ever looked at her and 
thought she was anything 
less than the most beautiful 
person in the world? Have 
my eyes once seen her nose 
consume her face, as you do 

the more I look at you? And 
why should I not afford you 
the same consideration?

When I look in the mirror 

and my eyes inevitably zero 
in on you, I’ll try to see my 
mom. I’ll see her father, a 
man who passed away when 
she was 9 but whose pictures 
could easily be those of an old 
Egyptian movie star. 

A lifetime of self-scrutiny 

imposed by deeply ingrained 
white, 
Eurocentric 
beauty 

standards will be hard to undo. 
But you are my inheritance — 
a direct link to generations 
of my family before me. How 
could I look at you now with 
anything but love?

The inherent politic of STEM: 
The weaponry of the DNA test

Perhaps family is a set of 

relationships 
characterized 

by DNA or “blood,” as age-old 
proverbs may indicate. But this 
definition may not be so all-
encompassing; for one, it would 
render adoption illegitimate and 
negates what some of us consider 
our “chosen families.” When we 
shift our lens to Southeastern 
Asia, specifically Tibet, this 
rigidity surrounding the ways 
we define familial relationships 
becomes more complex.

In Carole McGranahan’s essay 

“What is a Family? Refugee 
DNA and the Possible Truths of 
Kinship,” she discusses the story 
of Tashi, a Tibetan man who 
traveled as a refugee to Canada, 
leaving his wife and four children 
in a refugee camp in south 
Asia to await the legal process 
for later family reunification. 
The 
Canadian 
government, 

which employs DNA testing to 
verify claims of family relations 
(on the inaccurate basis that 
refugees are prone to lying 
and deceiving legal systems), 
asserted that Tashi would need 
to take a DNA test to prove that 
he was his childrens’ father, as 
he had claimed he was. When 
the results of the test returned, 
it was discovered that he was 
not the biological father of his 
children, indicating that his wife 
had an extramarital affair. This 
was the first time he had heard 
of this infidelity; yet, because 
the genetic father had never 
claimed nor met the children, 
Tashi had always been the father 
of his children. According to the 
Canadian immigration process, 
Tashi was untruthful and not 
the father of his children. But in 
Tibet, this test indicates nothing 
about the truth — or lack thereof 
— of Tashi’s fatherhood.

The familial structure in Tibet 

can be described as patrilineal 
and 
sometimes 
polyandrous. 

Perhaps, 
though, 
assigning 

Western names and concepts 
to this may lead us astray in 
our understanding of Tibetan 
society. 
Non-genetic 
fathers 

may claim children that are not 
genetically related to them and, 
if not bound by marriage, genetic 
fathers 
can 
choose 
whether 

or not to claim their children. 
Whether or not children are 
absorbed into the patrilineage 
determines their roles in society 
and within the family. In a 
polyandrous family, wherein a 
Tibetan woman is married to a 

set of brothers, all husbands are 
equally considered father by all 
her children. It is worth noting 
as well that extramarital affairs 
are not accepted in traditional 
Tibetan society and often result 
in physical punishment. But, 
knowledge of infidelity does not 
cancel out a father’s paternity 
of his children. Thus, family in 
Tibet much more than a biological 
marking — it is a system of care, 
kinship beyond blood and mutual 
understanding and service. 

DNA testing in the Western 

world is often the ultimate truth 
of fatherhood. TV shows, such 
as “Maury” and “The Jerry 
Springer 
Show,” 
have 
their 

premise entirely based on testing 
paternity 
genealogically. 
The 

moment that the test results 
are revealed, fathers (or non-
fathers) jump for joy, revel in an 
I-told-you-so moment, or hang 
their heads in despair. And in 
that moment, they choose how 
to define their relationship with 
the child they may or may not 
have previously known — or at 
the least, they begin to wonder 
what they will do. This is a 
significant determinant of their 
fatherhood and their relationship 
(or lack thereof) with the child. 
Understanding DNA testing as 
truth requires a rigid, medicalized 
lens, wherein the concept of 
family has entered the purview 
of medicine and is therefore 
intrinsically 
biomedical; 
in 

this 
medicalized 
perspective, 

family is defined strictly by 
genetic and biological indicators. 
Immigration 
processes 
in 

Canada, which require the use of 
DNA testing, are thus completely 
closed off to those who view their 
families and communities as 
anything other than biological. 
And as McGranahan argues, DNA 
testing relies on “categories of 
belonging that do not necessarily 
belong to the group being tested.” 
Canada’s 
family 
reunification 

process is more than simply 
a matter of truth versus lie; 
instead, it is a carefully exacted 
aim at determining worthiness 
based on Western conceptions 
and an actualization of harmful 
stereotypes and misconceptions 
about 
immigrants 
through 

biological tools.

In Tashi’s story, family is 

medicalized, 
and 
institutions 

— in this case, the Canadian 
government and its immigration 
process 
— 
employ 
biopower 

(biological 
methods 
used 
to 

exert sociopolitical control over 
populations) to decide who is 
worthy of entry and livelihood. 
The 
biomedical 
perspective 

employed by the immigration 
forces 
directly 
opposes 
the 

systems of collective care, family 
structure and lineage that exist 
in Tibet. The results of Tashi’s 
test were more than the results 
of 
paternity; 
they 
provided 

immigration officials a claim of 
power—a false notion that they 
had determined the absolute truth 
about Tashi’s family and that only 
they had the ability to determine 
this 
truth. 
As 
McGranahan 

notes, if DNA testing shows that 
a Tibetan parent and child are 
not genetically related as such, 
the Canadian government is not 
required to follow up on this 
claim. It becomes a burden that 
the applicant must take on to 
appeal the results of the test and 
provide 
substantial 
evidence 

through 
documentation 
that 

proves the familial relationship. 
But, in the case of Tashi and 
other Tibetan refugees, such 
documentation may not exist. 
In Tibet, birth and marriage 
certificates are not traditional 
processes; 
the 
legitimacy 
of 

birth, marriage, and identity are 
not determined by documents, 
as they are in Canada and in 
many cases, the Western world 
altogether. If these documents are 
unavailable to appeal the decision 
of the immigration office, the 
appeal process becomes reliant 
upon 
telling 
one’s 
narrative 

through an immigration attorney 
and from the letters of friends, 
acquaintances, and even Tibetan 
government 
officials. 
This 

process is often long and arduous, 
and requires notions of “proof” 
that may be inconsistent between 
these two nations across the 
globe from one another. Indeed, 
this truth in and of itself is 
inconsistent between Tibet and 
Canada. In Tibet, family is not 
so clear-cut; the truth of familial 
relationships is determined solely 
by those involved and is not a 
decision for the government. 
The lines between family and 
not-family are blurred within 
the system of community care 
and mutual aid that Tibetan 
society renders of utmost value. 
As the Canadian government 
and Western immigration offices 
define, family is a “yes” or “no,” 
a “true” or “false” determined 
by genealogical testing. When 
these worlds meet, with existing 
anti-immigrant 
rhetoric 
and 

bias on the part of the Canadian 
government, the Western refugee 
system is likely to employ its 
many loopholes that have been 
carefully constructed to restrict 
individuals and families from the 
lives they seek.

Black Art and Spirituality

The irony of the Black arts being 

one of the most widely reproduced, 
shared and appropriated forms 
of art in the modern era — 
despite centuries of exploitation, 
maltreatment 
and 
oppression 

— serves as a testament to the 
universality it possesses, as well 
as its inherent spiritual nature. 
Looking closely at the intersection 
of Black arts and spirituality can 
give us a better appreciation for 
the profound beauty of art in 
itself and for our shared lived 
experience as human beings. 
Author Christine Valters Paintner 
defines spirituality as the “search 
for meaning in life.” She states that 
meaning — or what psychologist 
Victor Frankl refers to as the 
“primary motivational force” in 
a person — allows us to develop a 
relationship to the unanswered 
mysteries of life, and enables us 
to cultivate values, direction and 
hope in a world of suffering and 
pain. 

While religion, according to 

Encyclopedia Britannica, refers to 
a specific and particular set of faith 
and worship, spirituality refers 
to the quality of the human spirit 
or soul. Evidently, spirituality is 
often an integral part of religion 
and vice versa. As we see in the 
U.S., religion and spirituality play 
a pivotal role in Black culture, 
with 79% of Black Americans 
identifying 
with 
Christianity, 

2% identifying with Islam, and 
3% identifying with other non-
Christian faiths. A. Wade Boykin, 
an African American education 
scholar, describes spirituality as 
being one of the nine interrelated 
dimensions of African American 
(and African Diasporic) culture 
and expressive behavior — the 
others being harmony, movement, 
verve, 
affect, 
communalism, 

expressive 
individualism, 
oral 

tradition and social time... all key 
aspects of art as well. It’s no wonder 
why artistry, which implores us to 
exercise our primal urge to bring 
something new into being or to 
partake in the act of creating, 
remains a key aspect of religions 
which establish faith in a Creator. 
Paintner states that the arts are 
“rooted in the existential capacity 
of the imagination to transcend 
literal reality, they present us 
with alternative ways of being 

and present insights only available 
through non-cognitive means.” In 
a society where Black people have 
historically had to find alternative 
ways to subsist, survive, and thrive 
in our daily lives, this notion of 
transcendence carries with it 
powerful implications. 

Tricia 
Hersey, 
a 
Black 

performance artist and activist, 
states, “At the heart of us as human 
beings, I believe that it’s our 
divinity to create and invent. In the 
seat of our creativity is spiritual 
practice.” She recognizes that “our 
energy as spiritual creatures is to 
live, survive, connect, thrive, get to 
our highest self, and to remember.” 
Hersey’s work as an artist and 
community healer is rooted in that 
of Black liberation theology, which 
James Cone, author of “Black 
Theology 
and 
Black 
Power,” 

defines as “a rational study of the 
being of God in the world in light 
of the existential situation of an 
oppressed community, relating the 
forces of liberation to the essence 
of the Gospel, which is Jesus 
Christ.” By viewing Biblical texts 
as a redemptive means — one that 
liberates the oppressed — Hersey 
was able to connect her artistic 
creative practice as being one that 
fostered her inner divinity and 
relationship to God.

This idea of the arts as a 

means for restoration is explored 
by author Stephen K Levine in 
“Art Opens to the World.” He 
asserts that the sensory-affective 
experience inherent in art-making 
helps us reestablish our ability to 
respond effectively to the world 
around us. 

To Levine, the process of 

making art requires us to give up 
control and transcend our barriers 
through faith. He insists that we 
must put ourselves in a state of 
“non-knowing” in order to achieve 
mastery. 

It’s easiest to see these notions in 

the realm of theatrical expression. 
In Sharrell D. Luckett and Tia M. 
Shaffer’s anthology “Black Acting 
Methods,” 
Shaffer 
discusses 

how actors must develop their 
capacity to respond organically 
to stimuli, or in other words, 
maintain a “sense of unpredictable 
aliveness.” She reinforces how 
this idea of “non-knowing” is 
prevalent 
in 
improvisation, 

which is characterized by an 
acceptance of the unknown. In 
the chapter, Biggs also examines 
how specifically Black actresses 

are able to use improv as a means 
for cultivating their ability to 
survive 
in 
an 
unpredictable, 

fundamentally unstable world. 
Like Hersey states, “You have to 
be creative in a place that wants to 
see you dead.” 

Black actor Freddie Hendricks 

developed an acting practice 
known as the Hendricks Method 
which explores several aspects, 
including devising, spirituality, 
and the hyper-ego, the latter 
of which Luckett and Shaffer 
define as the “seat of the soul” 
of the method itself. His work is 
mounted on the belief that the 
Spirit will lead the way, and that 
it is crucial for the Black actor to 
draw upon this spiritual power in 
performance.

This idea of the soul is a critical 

aspect of the Black musical 
experience as well. As African 
American jazz guitarist Bobby 
Brown once said, “Any great art is 
a transfer of emotion. Musically, 
soul is what we speak of as being 
transferred from the player to the 
listener, as in soul-to-soul.” As 
we saw in “Soul,” Pixar’s latest 
movie, singers, rappers, dancers 
and musicians put themselves 
in a state of optimal flow while 
performing when they allow 
themselves to be fully present in 
the moment in which their sense 
of time is altered. Black artists 
during performance reach this 
state of flow by establishing a 
connection with the internal 
rhythm of life, that in turn 
produces a profound emotional 
effect on the listener and observer. 
We can see this in gospel, soul, 
jazz, hip-hop, rap and a variety of 
other genres of Black music. Na’im 
Akbar, a clinical psychologist and 
University of Michigan alum, 
states that “the energy system 
of Black personality is rhythm.” 
Feeling the flow of rhythm unites 
us with the universe and the 
natural world around us. 

While these examples only 

begin to scratch the surface, 
it’s clear that the connection 
between Black art and spirituality 
continues to serve as a means of 
connecting with that which is 
transcendent. It reminds us that 
even in a time of great instability, 
uncertainty 
and 
tension 
in 

which many of us are feeling 
trapped, 
disenfranchised 
and 

marginalized, we can always look 
within to find something deeper 
than ourselves that can set us free.

Patriotism is overrated

D

uring a three-hour drive 
through 
the 
disastrous 

Bombay 
highways, 

my mom relayed the story of her 
citizenship ceremony. My parents 
became American citizens in 2005, 
but it came at a cost: They had to 
renounce their Indian citizenship. As 
“The Star-Spangled Banner” played 
in the courthouse, my mom grew 
misty-eyed as an integral aspect of 
her identity was replaced by that of 
a post-9/11 country where she felt 
uncomfortable wearing her cultural 
clothing in public. My sister and I 
exchanged glances of confusion as my 
mom continued by explaining that the 
Indian national anthem brought on a 
wave of patriotism in her, even today. 
Neither of us could imagine feeling 
so tied to our home country, nor 
the feeling of loss when unclasping 
yourself from your roots. 

I primarily think of myself as 

American. I was born less than 
20 minutes from the University of 
Michigan campus and spent my 
childhood in small towns across 
Michigan. This is my home, and it 
always will be. 

Nevertheless, the feeling of 

intense patriotism that my mom 
feels for the place she was born 
has never resonated with me. At 
football games, I stand up out 
of respect for others and fear of 
retribution, not necessarily for the 
flag or because I feel the loyalty that 
sweeps the crowds. This country 
was not made for or by myself or 
my ancestors.

It’s possible that this lack of 

patriotism is generational. Only 
32% of millennials believe that the 
United States is the greatest country 
in the world — a 16% drop from 
Generation X. Thus, it stands to 
reason that Generation Z would be 
even less patriotic than every previous 
generation. However, in America, 
Gen Z’s lack of patriotism may be 
due to its greater racial and ethnic 
diversity, as well as the higher number 
of immigrant families. 

Or, perhaps the growing criticism 

of the U.S.’s policies and institutions 
has contributed to a decreased sense of 
national pride. Nevertheless, it seems 
counterproductive to assimilation that 
a first-generation American like myself 
would feel such a deep disconnect with 
this increasingly diverse, melting pot of 
the world. 

Many would consider a lack of 

patriotism to be a fault of myself, my 
parents or even my education. Patriots 
are seen as the backbone of the 
country, the lifeblood of government 
and the basis for national pride. 
Naturally, patriotic sentiment has 
long been intertwined with wanting 
a country to succeed. Since the Cold 
War, patriotism has been considered 
necessary to be a true American. It 
was a tool to distinguish between 
those who belong in America and 
those who were threats. 

However, this crude, outdated idea 

of patriotism fails to recognize that it 
is no longer a dichotomy, but rather a 
spectrum of ideas about how people 
interact with their country and with 

their fellow citizens. Patriotism no 
longer has any bearing on who does 
or doesn’t belong in America and 
shouldn’t be used as any measure of 
worth for an American. 

Over the past few years, members 

of my generation have had their eyes 
opened to the misdeeds of the U.S. It 
has become increasingly apparent 
that the financial freedom and 
“family values” for which America 
was once revered by its people were 
actually tools of oppression, designed 
to only uplift certain groups of people 
— namely wealthy white people. 

As people have come to these 

realizations, there have been calls 
for change across the country. But 
political parties on both sides of the 
aisle have co-opted patriotism as the 
way to restore unity to the country, 
which has only led to increased 
polarization as Republicans and 
Democrats alike believe that their 
definition of patriotism is the correct 
one. This tool of division is only 
doing what it was intended to do, and 
intense feelings of patriotism have not 
helped in restoring any sense of unity. 

Without 
this 
overwhelming 

allegiance clouding our collective 
vision, we would be able to look at 
this country through a more objective 
lens. Our love for this nation would 
be defined only by virtue of this 
being our home, the place where 
we have chosen to build our lives 
and not by some sense of American 
exceptionalism. Criticism of U.S. 
institutions and policies would be 
more poignant, and sensible foreign 
ideals might be able to permeate our 
unnecessarily thick skin. 

As a first-generation American, I 

am somewhere in the middle of the 
vast spectrum of patriotism. I see this 
country for what it is, but moreover, 
for what it can be. My parents came 
to this country for a better life, for 
education and for the promise of a 
bright future. 

And as an American, I am deeply 

invested in helping this country 
reach its full potential, regardless 
of my apparent lack of patriotic 
sentiment. I would not die for this 
country as it is now; I probably 
wouldn’t even mildly inconvenience 
myself for it. 

But I would die to make it better.

Democrats should avoid sweeping 

progressive policy changes

W

ith 
the 
victories 

of 
Democratic 

candidates 
Jon 

Ossoff and Raphael Warnock 
in the Georgia Senate runoff 
elections on Jan. 5, the Senate 
majority now belongs to the 
Democrats. Since the Democrats 
already 
control 
the 
House 

of 
Representatives 
and 
the 

presidency, the Democrats now 
have a unified government for 
the first time since 2011. 

Naturally, 
Democrats 
are 

excited about this prospect — 
especially having a Senate with 
a Democratic majority, which 
makes legislating far easier. 
They can bring bills to the Senate 
floor that otherwise wouldn’t 
have received a vote now that 
Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is 
no longer the Senate Majority 
Leader, and they also should have 
the votes to pass such legislation.

However, 
it’s 
easy 
for 

Democrats to dream of the 
policy that could be rather 
than the policy that should be. 
This election was a rejection of 
Donald Trump, not a rejection of 
conservatism or the traditional 
values of the Republican Party. 
By no means was it a vote for 
sweeping progressive policies. 

Although 
the 
Democrats 

maintained their majority in the 
House of Representatives, they 
lost seats, making this majority 
much slimmer than in the last 
session of Congress. The fact 
that Republicans gained seats in 
the House but lost the presidency 
is important because the House 
is the body that more closely 
represents individual voters. 

Voters have not abandoned 

conservatism or the Republican 
Party; 
they 
abandoned 

Trumpism. Individualism, limited 
government and republicanism 
are still valued by many American 
voters, 
especially 
those 
who 

split their ticket, voting for Joe 
Biden for president and for the 
Republican candidate for their 
congressional representative.

Similarly, in the Senate, the 

Democrats lost seats that they 
were expected to win, including 
seats occupied by Sen. Susan 
Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Thom 
Tillis, R-N.C., who both won their 
reelection campaigns. While the 
Democrats did successfully flip 
four seats, gaining a net three 
seats in the Senate, all of the 
flipped seats came from senators 
who were closely aligned with 
Trump: Martha McSally, Cory 
Gardner, Kelly Loeffler and 
David 
Perdue 
all 
embraced 

Trump 
in 
their 
campaigns, 

and all lost to their Democratic 
challengers. In the Senate, ties 
to Trump in moderate or even 
center-right 
states 
doomed 

campaigns. 

The Senate, like the House, 

also has a small margin of 
dominance, 
the 
smallest 

possible: a 50-50 split with 
Vice President Kamala Harris 
as the tiebreaker. Should the 
Republicans vote unanimously, a 
single “no” from the Democratic 
side would result in a “no” vote 
for that bill in the Senate. Sen. 
Joe 
Manchin 
III, 
D-W.Va., 

would likely vote against any 
progressive legislation, as he 
comes from a deep red state and 
has voted with Republicans on 
consequential matters before. 

Progressive 
legislation 

would harm House Democrats 
who represent swing districts. 
Because House representatives 
are up for election every two 
years, they face an electorate that 
remembers their specific votes, 
especially votes on controversial 
bills and issues. 

If 
Democrats 
embrace 

far-left policies now, it will 
be at their peril come 2022. 
Representatives from moderate 
districts will almost certainly 
face strong challenges from more 
conservative, that is, Republican, 
candidates. Additionally, party 
members don’t always vote with 
their party — already this year, 
five Democrats voted against 

reelecting 
U.S. 
Rep. 
Nancy 

Pelosi, D-Calif., as Speaker of the 
House. 

This is not to say that 

Democratic control of Congress 
isn’t a major win for the party. 
With McConnell out as Senate 
Majority Leader, the Democrats 
will be able to bring legislation to 
the floor for a vote that a Senate 
with McConnell would never 
have brought up. 

The most relevant example 

of this is the stimulus package, 
as McConnell refused to allow 
the Senate to vote on the 
Caring for Americans with 
Supplemental 
Help 
Act 
to 

give a $2,000 stimulus check 
to Americans, even though 
the bill was passed by the 
House. With a Democrat as 
the Majority Leader, the CASH 
Act will receive a vote in the 
Senate and will likely pass. 
Other actions a Democratic-
controlled Senate can take are 
appointing liberal judges to 
the courts, passing legislation 
to fight climate change and 
furthering former President 
Barack Obama’s health care 
law. 

The elections of Ossoff and 

Warnock are, without question, 
excellent for the Democrats. A 
Democrat-controlled 
House, 

Senate and presidency allow 
Biden to set the policy agenda 
and allow Congress to execute it. 
But just because the Democrats 
have the power to execute 
sweeping legislative change does 
not mean they should use it. 

Progressives 
in 
Congress 

will likely endorse major policy 
proposals such as Medicare 
for All and a Green New Deal, 
but these policies cannot be 
considered if Democrats want 
to maintain their congressional 
majorities in 2022 and keep a 
Democrat in the White House 
in 2024.

How a pair of sneakers represents American identity

B

eing 
the 
first 
to 
do 

something is a feat; it makes 
the accomplishment that 

much greater. For Vice President 
Kamala Harris, being a “first” can be 
considered one of her specialties. 

She is the first South Asian 

American senator in U.S. history, the 
first African American and South 
Asian American vice president in 
U.S. history and the first female vice 
president in U.S. history. Another 
topic in the recent discourse, 
however, is that she is the first 
politician to wear Chuck Taylors in 
the West Wing, boldly reinvigorating 
traditional political dress. 

To Harris, a sense of purpose 

and the means to accomplish it is 
epitomized by her Converse All Stars. 
In October 2020, Harris famously 
showcased her embellished white 
high-tops with badges pinned to the 
sides of her trainers. The messages 
included “Black Joy,” “Stop Hate” 
and “Love 2020,” nodding to the 
feelings of those in attendance to 
her Florida rally and the millions 
back home suffering from the loss 
of American lives as a result of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, as well as acts 
of racial injustice. 

Throughout 
her 
grueling 

campaign, Harris stood wearing 
her self-titled “power pearls” and 
sneakers, confident that her political 
initiatives would soon take full stride. 
Yet the critics fixating on her clothing 
choices rather than policy proposals, 
assailing her style as distracting and 
trivial, make her Chuck Taylors all 
the more meaningful. Talking about 
her shoe choice is neither sexist nor 
distracting; it is instead a recognition 
of the sexism and judgment she 
pledges to overcome.

Female politicians’ wardrobes have 

been a frequent topic of discussion 
and scrutiny, and are one thing that 
their male counterparts usually avoid 
press coverage about. While First 
Lady Jackie Kennedy was idolized 
for her iconic hats and colored sets, 
Michelle 
Obama 
was 
criticized 

for her inexpensive gowns and 
exposed arms. Whether praising or 
condemning, there is an inescapable 
gaze and assessment of women in 
politics’ physical appearance.

Glass ceilings and the chains of 

fashion expectations are there for 
us to smash. Small acts of rebellion 
recognized by our nation’s biggest 
figures turn the initial fracture 

into a successful breakage of these 
confinements. Harris’s shoes do 
matter, and what they represent 
is why she was elected as another 
“first.” 

They are not the traditional high 

heels common of a politician. They 
are not meant for presentation or 
special occasions. They are a new 
symbol. They are meant for action, 
productivity and doing. Although 
a pair of sneakers does not seem 
revolutionary at first glance, they are. 

The beauty of Chuck Taylors is 

that they evoke an authentic feel 
because they’re affordable sneakers 
etched in American history: a canvas 
sole with a rubber base, worn from 
the early 20th century until the 
modern-day. 
Converse 
sneakers 

were even exempt from the rubber 
rationing during World War II, as the 
American people viewed the iconic 
shoes as a central component to the 
American identity and protested 
against the ration. The growing 
influence of television and celebrity 
endorsements beginning in the 
1950s was responsible for creating 
new sneaker archetypes: the athlete, 
the celebrity and the rebel without a 
cause. 

Despite the famed sneaker’s shift in 

audience, its origin remains rooted in 
youth culture that has now moved to 
the mainstream. When speaking in an 
interview, Harris notes that “Chucks 
— whatever your background is, 
whatever language your grandmother 
spoke — you know, we all at some point 
or another had our Chucks.” Shedding 
light on American culture, Kamala 
Harris’s feet are firmly planted in our 
nation’s history. 

I myself own a pair of high-top 

Chuck Taylors and wear them 
frequently on campus. Prior to 
this year, I had not been aware of 
their history, nor that the shoes I 
had bought as a fashion statement 
would now be looked at as a part 
of a political revolution. Their 
significance is not limited to Election 

Day but instead applies to anyone 

seeking to be a “first” in their school, 
community or country. 

Adam Cohn, vice president of 

global brand design for Converse, 
shares, “The star chevron has 
been in use since the ’70s and we 
wanted to make it a major part of 
our identity — that part of the brief 
was clear: Let’s leverage an icon 
that’s part of our heritage that’s 

also representative of moving 
forward.” 

Moving forward is representative 

of all genders, races, beliefs and 
orientations, 
of 
which 
Kamala 

Harris is the exemplar. It is time to 
lace up.

“

Poor kids are just as 
bright ... as white kids.”

When Joe Biden made 

this gaffe on Aug. 9, 2019, in 
response to a question about 
his education policy, I felt 
my skin crawl. While I think 
this was a genuine mistake in 
word choice, Biden’s comment 
had real resonance because it 
reflects an America where 
your race and socioeconomic 
status are inextricably linked. 

Since schools are largely 

funded 
through 
property 

taxes, 
many 
majority-

minority 
urban 
areas, 

especially Black and Hispanic 
ones, tend to have lower-
quality 
schools 
and 
more 

financial 
hardship, 
which 

decreases 
their 
likelihood 

to obtain a postsecondary 
degree. This is a major reason 
why 54% of associate’s degrees 
and 63% of bachelor’s degrees 
conferred in 2018 belong to 
white graduates, while 36% of 
associate’s degrees and 25% of 
bachelor’s degrees belong to 
Hispanic and Black graduates 
combined. 

However, 
attainment 

disparities do not only fall 
on 
racial 
lines. 
Regional 

factors, especially the rural-
urban divide, exacerbate the 
opportunity gap. As of 2015, 
16.7% of rural families lived 
in 
poverty 
and 
therefore 

experience 
increased 

hardship in attending college. 
Thus Michigan, a state with 
significant 
proportions 
of 

urban 
Black 
communities 

(13.4%) 
and 
rural 
white 

communities 
(24.1%), 
has 

many institutional barriers 
for its citizens to attend 
college, contributing to only 
44% of Michiganders between 
ages 16 and 64 having a 
postsecondary 
degree 
or 

equivalent certificate as of 
2016.

Enter 
Gov. 
Gretchen 

Whitmer. In her State of 
the State address on Feb. 
12, 2019, she announced the 
MI Opportunity Initiative, 
which seeks to increase the 
percentage of Michiganders 
with a postsecondary degree 
to 60% by 2030. One of the 
main methods of her three-
pronged approach is the MI 
Opportunity 
Scholarship, 

which 
guarantees 
every 

Michigan 
graduating 
high 

schooler two years of free 
tuition at any community 
college in the state, regardless 
of means. It also provides 
a two-year scholarship of 
$2,500 per year to any public 
or private non-profit four-
year university in Michigan, 
provided that the student 
averaged at least a 3.0-grade 
point average and is from a 
household making less than 
$80,000 per year. 

This 
policy 
is 
modeled 

off of the Oregon Promise 
and 
Tennessee 
Promise 

scholarship 
programs, 

which 
both 
guarantee 

free community college to 
graduating high schoolers, and 
their success signals that the 
MI Opportunity Scholarship 
could have similar success 
in 
increasing 
enrollment 

at 
community 
colleges. 

According to Gov. Whitmer, 
the 
target 
population 
is 

Michigan adults as a whole, 
so the scholarship will likely 
serve that population well 
since the Oregon Promise 
increased 
across-the-board 

enrollment between 4% and 
5% at community colleges. 

Similarly, the Tennessee 

Promise increased enrollment 
4% in its first year and 
sustained that rate in the 
following year. Additionally, 
the Tennessee Promise shows 
an increase, albeit small, in 
enrollment 
for 
minorities. 

While they are not the stated 
targets of this scholarship 
program, 
increasing 
the 

attendance of minority and 
rural 
students 
should 
be 

of 
paramount 
importance 

to 
lawmakers, 
and 
these 

programs alone do not seem 
to accomplish this goal to a 
large extent.

Economically, 
the 
MI 

Opportunity 
Scholarship 

will cost $80 million to $100 
million, but the upfront cost 
will be offset by the future 
economic benefits of having 
more educated professionals 
in 
the 
state. 
These 

professionals will be paying 
more 
taxes 
because 
they 

make larger sums of money 
and they will stimulate the 
economy because of more 
entrepreneurship, disposable 
income 
and 
community 

involvement. 
This 
benefit 

may 
be 
deferred, 
but 
it 

ultimately 
mitigates 
the 

upfront costs. 

The most salient argument 

against this policy is that 
political support is going to be 
difficult to gather in the state 
legislature, especially when 
Democrats 
control 
every 

statewide elected office while 
the Republicans control both 
houses of the legislature. This 
legislature has already made 
life exceedingly difficult for 
Whitmer’s 
administration, 

having 
blocked 
her 

environmental 
executive 

order and bringing the state 
to the brink of a government 
shutdown in her first year in 
office. 

This partisan environment 

is not particularly conducive 
to 
deal-cutting, 
but 
this 

bill could garner bipartisan 
support in the near future, 
taking 
inspiration 
from 

the 
Tennessee 
Promise 

program, which was passed 
by a Republican legislature 
with 
bipartisan 
support 

and signed by a Republican 
governor. If Gov. Whitmer 
and the Democrats make this 
a chief legislative priority, 
they 
could 
likely 
bring 

Republicans along, because 
everyone should be able to 
agree on educating our state’s 
children. It is just a question 
of expending political capital 
to pass the policy.

Now, while I recognize 

that 
the 
MI 
Opportunity 

Scholarship has perils, it is 
nevertheless a step in the right 
direction toward mitigating 
harmful impacts of economic 
inequality 
and 
increasing 

educational 
achievement 

across the board. 

If 
this 
law 
passes, 

Michiganders 
will 
see 

the positive effects in the 
foreseeable 
future, 
which 

will make it easier to pass 
legislation further expanding 
funding 
for 
community 

colleges 
and 
incentivizing 

achievement 
in 
four-year 

programs. These laws can 
finally help Michigan close 
the opportunity gap, because 
all kids really do deserve just 
as much of a chance as the 
white kids.

Whitmer is fighting to 

create more opportunities 

for Michiganders

Don’t let Biden forget about universal pre-k
I

n the wake of a contentious 
“culture war” election, it is 
easy for important policy 

promises to be forgotten. Much 
of President-elect Joe Biden’s 
appeal to many of his supporters 
was that he is not Donald Trump. 
Still, Biden came with his own 
array of policy promises. Some of 
them were simple and required no 
apparent capital investment, such 
as Biden’s promise that his team 
will lead with “science and truth.” 
Many of the president-elect’s 
proposals, however, will require 
significant capital investments 
and political will. 

Biden’s promise of providing 

universal 
prekindergarten 
for 

all 3 and 4-year-olds falls in 
the latter category. A universal 
preschool program would be 

highly beneficial to American 
families; it offers lifelong skills, 
an immense societal benefit and 
dramatic financial opportunities 
for parents. Unfortunately, this is 
a promise that may be obscured 
by 
other, 
more 
politically 

advantageous issues. 

To understand the importance 

of a universal prekindergarten 
program, we must understand 
how many of our preschool-aged 
children are currently enrolled 
in 
prekindergarten 
programs. 

As of 2018, only 68% of 4-year-
olds and 40% of 3-year-olds 
were enrolled in some sort of 
pre-primary program. These are 
worryingly low metrics and leave 
the United States far behind other 
developed nations. Less than 70% 
of Americans between 3 and 5 
years old were enrolled in some 

sort of pre-elementary program, 
compared to over 90% of children 
in France, Israel, Germany and 
11 other countries in the same 
age group. This disparity could 
have significant consequences 
for 
America’s 
place 
in 
the 

international order. Biden himself 
has claimed, “Any country that 
out-educates us is going to out-
compete us.”

Many children are deprived of 

a preschool education because of 
the cost — the median yearly price 
of child care in the U.S. has been 
calculated to be approximately 
$8,320. For a family living below 
the federal poverty line, up to a 
fifth of a family’s yearly income 
can be consumed through child 
care expenses. The benefits of 
universal preschool are not only 

present for the poorest Americans 
— child care costs consume 
between 7% to 12% of a family’s 
income for most middle-class 
Americans as well. 

The 
benefits 
of 
preschool 

programs for 3 and 4-year-olds 
are significant. Children who are 
enrolled in preschool programs 
have been observed to repeat 
grades significantly less often, 
enroll in more honors classes and 
score better on standardized tests. 
The prevailing theory for why 
preschool is so important is that 
it offers an extra opportunity for 
children to become accustomed 
to the school environment while 
receiving beneficial stimulation 
at the same time. These gains are 
much harder to make up later in a 
student’s education. 

Aside from the developmental 

advantages a preschool education 
confers, universal pre-K also has 
economic benefits for the people 
who are not sitting in those 
little plastic seats: the parents. 
When preschool is taken care 
of for parents, they have greater 
freedom to fully participate in 
the American labor market. In 
Michigan alone, there are over 
49,000 parents who had to quit 
their jobs or make significant 
cutbacks in participation because 
of child care problems, according 
to a 2016 survey. Losing this 
many workers has real economic 
implications. Over 49,000 fewer 
workers means that there are 
fewer people who are able to 
contribute to the economy in the 
forms of manufacturing capacity, 
a healthy labor market, state tax 

revenues and more.

There is also the matter of 

efficiency. Researchers estimated 
that every dollar spent on the 
city’s near-universal preschool 
yielded about two dollars worth of 
societal benefits. The development 
of self-regulation skills during the 
ages of 3 to 5 is crucial and is more 
costly to compensate for later 
in life. In the midst of economic 
calamity, and with an enormous 
federal deficit, it is a critical time 
to invest in policies that pay for 
themselves several times over and 
lay the foundation for a stronger 
next generation of Americans. 

Michiganders 
in 
particular 

should 
be 
at 
the 
frontlines 

of 
advocating 
for 
universal 

preschool. 
Many 
educators 

and legislators look fondly on 
Michigan’s Great Start Readiness 

Program, which has provided for 
the second year of kindergarten 
for many Michigan children. 
Michigan has seen the benefits 
for educating most of their 
4-year-olds, but the end goal 
for preschool education should 
still be to provide for all 3 to 
5-year-olds. While Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer is pushing for universal 
preschool for 4-year-olds by the 
end of her term, Michiganders 
will still benefit from a broader, 
federal approach to universal 
preschool. 

Biden and his administration 

may need an additional push to 
put universal pre-K front and 
center. Neither Biden nor Vice 
President-elect Kamala Harris 
have tweeted (an arbitrary but 
still important metric) on the 
topic of universal preschool since 
July 2020. This topic has been 
obscured by many meritorious 
causes, but nonetheless should not 
be overlooked. 

Since the President-elect and 

Vice President-elect’s tweets last 
summer, the weakness of our 
nation’s child care infrastructure 
has been highlighted as millions 
of students fall behind in math, 
reading, etc. However, a president 
has a limited number of things 
that they can achieve. Though 
Biden comes into office with 
a clear mandate to captain a 
systemic recovery, his political 
purse nonetheless has a bottom. 

Former 
President 
Barack 

Obama, 
for 
instance, 
was 

very interested in expanding 
preschool, yet was met with a 
stony face from an unenthusiastic 
Congress. Biden will have a 
much 
better 
opportunity 
to 

affect change in pre-elementary 
education — unlike during the 
Obama years, universal preschool 
has many ardent supporters in 
Congress, such as U.S. Rep. Rosa 
DeLauro, D-CT, the chair of the 
powerful House Appropriations 
subcommittee.

Universal preschool has been 

demonstrated as a sound policy 
that will save Americans money 
in the long run while caring for 
our nation’s children. Even with 
Democratic control of both the 
House of Representatives and 
the Senate, universal preschool 
legislation is unlikely to be 
enacted in the absence of strong, 
focused leadership. It will take 
passion from both the right and 
the left to ensure, amidst the 
ocean of change Biden hopes to 
enact, that this policy will stay in 
the spotlight.

O

n the overcast day of 
Nov. 22, 2020, like 
most 
occupants 
of 

the University of Michigan’s 
residence halls, I stuffed my 
belongings 
into 
cardboard 

boxes and dragged them to my 
mother’s car outside Bursley 
Residence 
Hall’s 
entrance. 

Once finished, I began the 
journey back home. 

Typically, college freshmen 

would be distraught at the 
prospect of leaving campus, 
their friends and newfound 
freedom. 
However, 
all 
I 

felt was relief. I especially 
took comfort in the fact 
that I wouldn’t be receiving 
the 
dreaded 
daily 
emails 

informing me that my building 
had multiple COVID-19 cases. 

The emails came at about 

10 a.m. Often, they arrived 
during 
classes, 
with 
the 

“Notification 
of 
Positive 

COVID-19 Case in Bursley” 
subject 
line 
making 
me 

involuntarily 
grimace 
on 

Zoom calls. While reading 
the emails, I’d pray under my 
breath for no more cases to be 
found within my hall. 

Every time I left my room 

to get meals, I felt anxious 
knowing the virus was found 
at multiple locations in the 
building. Even going to the 
bathroom felt terrifying. If I 
saw someone brushing their 
teeth at the same time as me, 
anxiety spiked. Wanting to 
keep safe, I strictly adhered 
to 
COVID-19 
restrictions, 

making it difficult to get to 
know people in my hall, which 
made the entire experience 
more taxing — it felt like 
our health was in strangers’ 
hands. 

According 
to 
the 

University’s 
Campus 

Blueprint, there have been 
687 reported cases in the 
residence halls since March 
8, 2020. Bursley Hall had 38 
reported cases, while South 
Quad Residence Hall and 
Mary 
Markley 
Residence 

Hall had 158 and 160 reported 
cases, respectively. 

Over the summer, when 

I was deciding whether to 
live on-campus in the fall, 
it seemed obvious to stay in 
the residence halls. Everyone 
in my family was fighting 
for space at home and online 
classes felt incredibly taxing 
from my childhood bedroom. 
Although I was nervous about 
COVID-19, I convinced myself 
that 
University 
Housing’s 

plans would be safe — I was 
desperate 
to 
move 
after 

staying 
in 
isolation 
with 

my family for so long. If I 
followed housing rules and 
used enough hand sanitizer, I 
would be fine. Right? 

Wrong. The University’s 

seeming lack of a public health 
plan with little to no regular 
COVID-19 testing caused a 
public health disaster in the 
residence halls, jeopardizing 
students’ 
and 
community 

members’ 
physical 
health. 

In fact, another side effect 
of the housing situation was 
extremely 
strained 
mental 

health, both for myself and 
many other college students. 

The 
regular 
freshman 

feelings of loneliness and 
confusion 
were 
magnified 

— in a study conducted by 
Texas 
A&M 
University, 

71% of students indicated 
increased stress and anxiety 
due to a COVID-19 outbreak. 
Such stress and anxiety can 
only be exacerbated by being 
confined to a tiny, enclosed 
room while trying to finish 
difficult online classes. LSA 
freshman Ayden Makar notes 
that “(residence hall life) was 

often lonely … and it got much 
worse once it got cold and 
dark outside.” 

While leaving my room 

felt horrifying, staying inside 
was the opposite — hollow. I 
was completely alone — like 
many others, I was assigned 
to a double, but my intended 
roommate chose to remain at 
home. I spent my days entirely 
by 
myself, 
hiding 
away 

from the chaos outside and 
repeating my days in a hazy 
blur. I spent all of my time 
trying to pass difficult yet 
intellectually 
unstimulating 

online classes. People only 
existed on a screen. I was 
lonely and unhappy.

Towards the end of the 

fall semester, the University 
announced that they wouldn’t 
reopen residence halls for 
the winter semester except 
for students with necessary 
circumstances. 
Residence 

halls would only be single 
residences. Additionally, the 
University finally decided to 
start mandatory COVID-19 
testing for all residents once 
a week. 

However, 
their 
efforts 

were too little, too late. The 
University 
is 
now 
known 

for its poor public health-
based decisions made by both 
the administration and its 
students that resulted in a 
massive outbreak. Many first-
year students moved back 
home with distrust in the 
institution. 

First-generation 
and 

low-income 
students 

will undoubtedly feel the 
results of this emotionally 
isolating 
and 
physically 

dangerous 
experience 
the 

most. According to a report 
by Ruffalo Noel Levitz, a 
higher education consulting 
firm, COVID-19 has changed 
the ability of at least 22% of 
families to pay for college. Due 
to the pandemic’s economic 
effects, 
many 
people 
are 

struggling 
to 
provide 
for 

themselves, 
let 
alone 
pay 

hefty increased tuition and 
room and board bills. More 
families are in a financially 
vulnerable 
position, 
and 

when the college experience 
received is of such low quality, 
many feel discouraged from 
going back to college. 

Lastly, 
the 
“freshman 

experience” is often discussed 
as a shared experience where 
people experience their first 
taste 
of 
freedom, 
attend 

parties and start discovering 
their identities. The current 
freshman class won’t get to 
enjoy this experience, and 
our entire college experience 
will be significantly changed 
because of COVID-19 — to us, 
the University of Michigan 
has 
started 
to 
symbolize 

something 
different. 
The 

Class 
of 
2024 
knows 
of 

the University not for its 
stellar 
academics, 
student 

life or sports, but rather 
its public health disasters, 
poor treatment of Graduate 
Student 
Instructors 
and 

difficult online classes. 

The 
University 
is 
in 

uncharted 
territory, 
and 

their recent policies — or lack 
thereof — have had terrible 
effects. It’s impossible to rely 
on the University to assure 
one’s safety and well-being. 
Now, it is the University’s 
job to earn back student and 
community trust by ensuring 
that our health and mental 
wellbeing is being addressed 
and supported to their best 
ability.

A

s we enter the new year 
of 2021, there is a unique 
energy in the air. It feels 

like the entire universe and cosmos 
are 
collaboratively 
wishing 
for 

concerts, crowded planes to faraway 
places 
and 
intimate 
reunions 

with loved ones devoid of this 
overarching 
fear 
of 
contraction 

and spread of disease. With the 
hope of widespread vaccinations 
and eventual development of herd 
immunity, this future has become a 
much more tangible reality; escaping 
the confinement of a quarantined, 
TikTok-heavy summer of wishful 
thinking, the new year resurrects 
the possibility of a return to a pre-
COVID-19 
yesterday, 
or 
better 

yet, a COVID-19-free tomorrow. 
This concurrence with a dawn of a 
new year introduces something in 
desperate need of analysis: New Year’s 
resolutions. 

New 
Year’s 
resolutions 
are 

commonly 
considered 
the 

opportunity to change your way of 
life; when a new year begins, it creates 
a faux blank slate on which new 
habits or hopes can be established. 
A great majority of resolutions 
are 
wellness 
or 
fitness-related, 

which sparks controversy among 
some who argue that a goal to lose 
weight or adopt a “healthy lifestyle” 
is merely a manifestation of the 
societally-perpetuated skinny ideal 
— something that has been shoved 

down our throats since the beginning 
of time. 

However, I argue that it is time 

to normalize wanting to change 
your habits as long as it is for a 
justifiable reason far beyond that of 
conforming to a societal standard. 
Arguably even more important than 
a person’s motivation is their chosen 
methodology for achieving this goal. 
Further, if it is a matter of choosing 
healthier foods, striving to workout 
and increasing daily hydration, that 
should not be shunned by hardcore 
#BodyPositivity 
influencers. 

However, if the chosen method even 
minorly involves excessive restriction 
or disordered eating, that reflects a far 
different problem than just resolving 
to lose weight. 

While 
#BodyPositivity 
and 

#Fitspiration aim to empower their 
largely female audience to be proud 
and confident in their own skin, there 
lies severely harmful rhetoric within 
the less prevalent communities like 
#thinspiration or #proAna internet 
bases. This must be underscored and 
understood. 

Thinspiration and Pro-Ana (pro-

anorexia) groups on the internet are 
extremely harmful and social media 
platforms like Instagram have taken 
steps to ban hashtags and block posts 
that perpetuate this movement. 
However, the mere existence of these 
communities represents deep-seated 
problems that society has propagated 

through many different vessels. The 
problem lies here: #BodyPositivity 
should be the freedom to choose how 
to feel in your body. Stretch marks, 
loose skin and all — it should not be a 
matter of comparison to determine 
your 
self-worth. 
Frankly, 
the 

underlying message is an important 
reminder I have to give myself as 
I traverse the artificial world of 
Snapchat filters that reduce the size 
of my nose and editing applications 
that can clear any imperfections on 
my skin. 

While I would argue the majority 

of #BodyPositivity members are 
aligned 
with 
these 
“healthier” 

ideologies, there are members of this 
community who judge and degrade 
other women who post their weight 
loss goals and results. They are told 
that you cannot be body positive 
and simultaneously want to change 
something about yourself. This is 
inherently untrue. Every time I 
enter the gym, I do so with the goal 
of gaining strength and endurance. 
However, I would be lying if I said I 
did not also leave the gym with the 
hopes that my efforts will provide 
me comfort in my clothes and a toned 
appearance. 

The 
imperative 
nature 
of 

differentiating between health and 
aesthetics must be emphasized. 
In a world where people strive to 
look like celebrities, we must first 
acknowledge that beauty media icons 

like the Kardashians or Jenners did 
not achieve the results we see on their 
Instagram feed with merely a hard 
workout or a good facial. 

We cannot resolve to achieve 

these results without recognizing 
that they were obtained through 
expensive 
and 
time-consuming 

means. Having said this, there is 
nothing wrong with getting plastic 
surgery as long as it is medically 
safe. This fits within my belief that 
the ability to change something 
is a part of what #BodyPositivity 
really means. I strive to argue on 
a moral basis that the ability to 
change something about yourself is 
not mutually exclusive from loving 
who you are. It is human nature to 
want to better yourself and it is your 
choice alone how or if that applies to 
you. 

As we enter this new year, it is the 

choice of each individual what they 
opt to leave behind in 2020 and how 
they choose to enter 2021. Whether 
that means you are content as you 
are, or you want to get Botox or you 
want to swear off makeup altogether, 
#BodyPositivity should allow and 
encourage the freedom to choose. As 
long as the methods taken are healthy 
and the justification is for more than 
conforming to a societal norm, why 
should anybody else have a say? 

T

his past summer marked 
a period of time in which 
support of the Black Lives 

Matter movement reached a focal 
point. We all saw the outpouring 
of support on Twitter, Instagram 
stories and news platforms, but fast 
forward to today and Black Lives 
Matter has simply become a slogan 
for many young people.

Black and minority populations 

in 
the 
United 
States 
have 

historically been both oppressed 
and suppressed. Many of these 
injustices came to light during 
the summer, leading many young 
people to take to the streets and 
demand 
equality 
— 
especially 

when it came to police brutality. 
However, many people neglected 
to acknowledge there was anything 
deeper than the injustices these 
groups face at the hands of the 
police. While police brutality is an 
important and legitimate part of the 
structural racism in this country, 
there are other factors that are just 
as important. 

Much of the overlooked inequity 

lies in redlining, Jim Crow laws, 
education policy, food deserts, 
gentrification, 
criminal 
justice 

discrepancies and, most currently, 
COVID-19 and the treatment of 
Black people within the American 
health care system. 

It is no secret that Black 

people in this country have been 
discriminated against in health 
care due to various individual 
biases and structural issues. A 
study conducted by The Health 
Care Financing Review found 
that there have historically been 
inequities in the health care system 

which have contributed to systemic 
racism, 
highlighted 
by 
higher 

rates of morbidity and mortality 
among Black people than among 
white people for most indicators of 
physical health. 

These 
inequities 
have 
been 

accentuated 
by 
the 
ongoing 

pandemic. Researchers at the Mayo 
Clinic found that Black Americans 
are 4.7 times more likely to be 
infected with the coronavirus than 
white Americans, putting them 
at an increased risk of serious 
illness or death, not to mention 
disproportionately exposing them 
to long term impacts and economic 
insecurity. This increased risk 
derives from the inequities in care 
traditionally afforded to Black 
patients versus white patients, such 
as denying pain medication and 
rushing through their care, as well 
as the comparatively high rate of 
Black Americans who suffer from 
preexisting conditions. 

Remember last summer when 

your friends posted a black square 
on their Instagram feeds to show 
their support for the movement, 
followed by maskless selfies with a 
new friend every day? The irony is 
evident. 

The same people who would 
preach about the importance 

of protecting Black lives often 
had no intention of taking any 
substantive action to accomplish 
that goal. Instead, they were putting 
the people they purported to be 
advocating for in grave danger. 
Those who continue to disregard 
the pandemic can no longer claim 
to be allies to the movement when 
they play a key role in perpetuating 

structural racism in this country. 

When we returned to school 

in August, the problems only 
worsened. It is no secret that 
the University of Michigan has 
struggled to contain the virus — 
numerous articles have highlighted 
the role of both students and the 
University in this failure. Once 
students came back to campus, 
massive parties quickly ensued. 

Under normal circumstances, 

this would merely be another 
weekend at the University. However, 
this semester, those parties were 
superspreader events which led 
to a surge in cases, some of which 
ended up permanently harming 
members of our community. I’m 
sure we can all name at least one 
individual who posted “Black Lives 
Matter” over the summer on their 
Instagram story and then, just three 
months later, posted pictures in a 
jam-packed living room kicking 
CDC guidelines to the curb in 
exchange for a little bit of fun with 
their friends. While they may not 
suffer any hardship from the virus 
themselves, many minorities in 
the community do not have this 
privilege and are more susceptible 
to negative outcomes. 

This begs the question, do 

individuals actually support this 
movement? Or is it merely a slogan 
to them, one that they can flaunt so 
they look good on social media? One 
of the biggest actions individuals 
can take right now, if they truly 
believe that Black lives matter, 
would be following CDC guidelines: 
Stay 
away 
from 
large 
social 

gatherings, wear a mask and allow 
health care professionals to allocate 

resources to the communities who 
need it the most. 

Since the advent of social media, 

the prevalence of performative 
activism 
has 
been 
pervasive. 

Because of this, the events this 
summer rubbed me and many 
others the wrong way. Performative 
activism is loosely defined as being 
an advocate on social media or in 
conversation, but not following 
through with those platitudes in 
their actions. 

It was almost universally agreed 

upon among people our age that 
police brutality and racism have 
no place in this country. However, 
when it was time for many to 
finally step up for the minority 
communities 
disproportionately 

affected by COVID-19 by following 
CDC guidelines, they prioritized 
themselves and their own pleasure 
over the pain of others. This is 
textbook performative activism and 
selfishness. 

It is time for people to realize that 

when they disregard guidelines, 
they are endangering human life, 
deepening the racial divide in this 
country and saying that Black lives, 
in fact, do not matter to them — all 
so they could get drunk in a dimly 
lit room with people they will never 
see again after four years. 

The question one must ask 

themselves is whether their support 
for Black Americans stops when it 
inconveniences them, or if they truly 
intend to be an ally to a historically 
marginalized community. If so, 
then they should act accordingly.

EW HAMPSHIRE | Seven people, 
clad in sleeping bags and down jack-
ets, are gathered in the tiny cabin 

atop Mt. Cabot, an elevation of 4,170 feet. Outside, 
the White Mountains roll for miles, sliding in ev-
ery direction after hours of rain. Inside, there’s one 
picnic table, four large plywood bunks and clothes 
drying on every available surface. The conversa-
tion drifts from directions to the nearest water 
source to hypothermia to poetry. Each student was 
instructed to bring a few poems, found in the camp 
library, that address the concept of the unknown. 

Four miles and three summits ago, the group 

had camped at Unknown Pond. They’d spent the 
evening reading short stories over the fire, fan-
ning it with a frisbee to ensure its smoky survival 
in the damp forest. Now, the seven crowd around 
the picnic table, journals open and headlamps on. 
After someone pulls the instant hot pack from the 
first aid kit so one student can warm his hands, 
class begins.

Tonight, the students are far from Ann Arbor, 

Mich., the quintessential college town home to 
the University of Michigan, and instead are deep 
in the New Hampshire wilderness. Sitting in this 
cabin is a privilege. They submitted essays, sat for 
interviews, paid tuition and drove across the coun-
try to be here. I suppose I should say “we” because 
the student peeking out of a sleeping bag reading 
poetry by David Budbill is me.

We were the 45th class spending our spring 

semester on the shores of Lake Winnipesaukee 
for the New England Literature Program. The 40 
of the 53 of us (40 students, 13 instructors) were 
there to earn nine English credits in six weeks. 
Former Facebook interns bunked with medical 
school hopefuls and creative writing majors; the 
instructors ranged from published authors to a 
hairdresser, a law school applicant and an English 
professor. We filled our days with Emerson and 
Thoreau, Dickinson and Glück, Frost and Freder-
ick Douglass — and with scrubbing toilets, baking 
bread, splitting wood, building fires, pitching tents, 
skinny dipping and writing of this world we’d cre-
ated, our newfound love.

Absent from this world was any form of mod-

ern technology, recorded music, alcohol or com-
munication with the outside, other than through 
letter writing. It might be odd, but the recipe 
has proven successful and remained largely un-
changed for 45 years.

What is alternative education?
The term “alternative education,” which can be 

“broadly 
defined as educational activities that fall 

outside the traditional K-12 curriculum” according 
to National Center for Education Evaluation and 
Regional Assistance, has typically been reserved 
for students who are at risk of failing school: 35 
states associate it with students who have behav-
ioral problems. While such programs, who focus 
on the outdoors as a method of rehabilitation, ex-
ist, this reservation implies a correlation between 
“alternative” and “problem” — that those who 
don’t thrive in a traditional classroom are the issue, 
instead of questioning how everyone could pos-
sibly succeed in the same classroom. But NELP 
requires an entry fee, literally and figuratively, 
and every admitted student counts themselves as 
lucky.

So, there’s a huge spectrum of alternative edu-

cation, and the terminology can be confusing. But 
as the definition explains, it can really be anything.

NELP is only one of the hundreds, maybe thou-

sands, of alternative education programs in the 
United States, and it’s not even the only one at the 
University of Michigan. The University also of-
fers Camp Davis, a geological station just outside 
Jackson Hole, Wyo., and the Biological Station in 
Pellston, Mich. Both programs provide Michigan 
students a break from the traditional classroom 
structure and pull them across the country to-
wards their subjects’ source: Walden pond for 
Thoreau readers and the Teton peaks for geolo-
gists. 

Camp Davis operates on a rolling basis, mean-

ing that classes drive out west from Ann Arbor 
one at a time, and periodically leave camp for one 
to three-day field trips into Yellowstone or City of 

Rocks, Idaho. The professors, many of whom have 
been making the trek for years, bring their fami-
lies and dogs, and every so often a graduate stu-
dent instructor’s significant other will turn up for 
a weekend. One evening in July 2018, there were 
over a hundred people — more than the mess hall 
could hold — so the kitchen staff threw an outdoor 
barbecue. A few weeks later, at the end of the sea-
son, only half of one class remained at the camp 
(the other half had gone camping), so the kitchen 
donned freshly-cleaned aprons and cooked a 
three-course French dinner. Though the kitchen 
staff was mostly U-M students looking for an ex-
cuse to live in the mountains (I know because I 
worked there in 2017 and 2018), meal flexibility is 
representative of the camp’s ethos.

The alternative education umbrella is wide. 

At the Alzar School, high school sophomores and 
juniors spend half their time at the Alzar cam-
pus in Cascade, Idaho and the rest in Patagonia, 
Chile, kayaking, backpacking and skiing their way 
through a fully accredited semester. Kristin Bierle 
founded Alzar with her husband, Sean, in 2004. 
The couple started out running one to three-week 
programs in the U.S. and Chile as they worked to-
ward their vision.

“When we sat down looking at the school, 

and what we need, what we wanted education 
to mean, we saw tremendous opportunities for 
growth and leadership development at the inter-
section of really engaging academics with cultural 
exchange,” Bierle said in a phone interview with 
The Daily. 

The school typically has 40 students per se-

mester, many of whom haven’t spent much time in 
the outdoors (in fact, all three programs don’t em-
phasize previous outdoor experience upon entry, 
though enthusiasm for leaving your comfort zone 
is a requirement). Alzar instructors teach the regu-
lar high school classes — honors and Advanced 
Placement math, science, English, Spanish and 
history — but are also leading expeditions, travel-
ing internationally with the students and pairing 
the outdoors with the class material to teach lead-
ership skills. 

“We’re not an organization where you’re go-

ing to have someone with a Ph.D. in physics from 
Harvard, who has been teaching the AP physics 
class for 25 years,” Bierle said. “I think that’s a tre-
mendous educator, and there’s tons of space in the 
educational landscape for that educator to exist 
and it’s really important, but for our model, that’s 
not where our power comes from.”

Her ideology is echoed in most alternative edu-

cation programs, but specifically at Deep Springs 
College, which calls itself a “unique institution of 
higher learning.” L.L. Nunn, an electricity mogul 
turned philanthropist and education experiment-
er, founded the school in 1917 around three pillars: 
academics, manual labor and student self-govern-
ment. Total student enrollment caps out at 
30 
, and 

the school isolates itself in Deep Springs Valley, 
Calif.

There is no set form for what an educator looks 

like. Kristin Fisher, who led the Unknown Pond 
trip, has taught at NELP for the past five years and, 
like most of the instructors, is a program alum her-
self. She’s been in almost every kind of classroom 
throughout her teaching career.

“When I’m planning a class, especially when 

we’re outside, I’m planning for a five-hour chunk 
of time. And I have to scout where we’re going and 
I have to know about the weather and I have to 
make sure that students are prepared with gear,” 
Fisher said in an Ann Arbor coffee shop, in Febru-
ary of 2020. “This is stuff that I don’t need to do in a 
classroom. I’m taking care of bodies. And in a class-
room, I’m taking care of minds a little bit more.”

But what does it 
look l 
ike?
T

he NCEE’s study found four criteria 
to measure alternative education pro-
grams by: “whom the program serves, 

where the program operates, what the program 
offers, and how the program is structured.” Be-
tween Camp Davis, Deep Springs College, Alzar 
School and NELP
, there were a few important 

similarities: Class sizes are small and instructor-to-
student ratios are high. They’re structured more 

like a community than a classroom, and the goal 
is to offer more than educational learning. They’re 
selective, and students 
want 
to be there.

***
U.S. Highway 191 winds its way north through 

the rolling Gros Ventre wilderness, toward Jack-
son and the sharp peaks of the Teton range. It’s 
punctuated by turn-offs to ranches with names 
like Bourbon Whiskey, Broken Arrow and Spot-
ted Horse. Like NELP
, the trip to Hoback, Wyo-

ming begins in a U-M van, five students each. 
Camp Davis’ driveway is signaled by its hanging 
wooden sign, emblazoned with the University’s 
block ‘M,’ but anyone will tell you it’s the large 
metal moose, property of Bourbon Whiskey, that 
declares the geology students have made it. From 
above, the driveway looks like someone draped a 
ribbon across the land. It’s a full mile of packed dirt 
and gravel road with a 15 mph speed limit. On the 
group’s third day of driving west, a caravan of tired 
strangers inches their way toward Mt. Anne and 
the small camp tucked in at the base.

Even though all four programs are housed in 

the realm of alternative education, they operate 
differently. Camp Davis, Alzar and Deep Springs 
have campuses designed for educational use, 
meaning they have classrooms, labs and comput-
ers for some lessons. The rest take place wherever 
the instructors deem appropriate. At Alzar, that 
means anything from English class on the banks 
of the Payette River, though an empty classroom is 
nearby, to learning about environmental steward-
ship in the woods with a drill in hand. Camp Davis 
students chatter about their upcoming Yellow-
stone trip over the morning’s scrambled eggs and 
bacon. An hour later, they’re running across the 
driveway, towing tents and hiking boots and the 
occasional floatie for relaxing after class. 

Unlike the other three, NELP doesn’t have a 

permanent space. All of its materials — tents and 
camping equipment, kitchen utensils and hun-
dreds of books for the camp library among other 
things — are packed into a shipping container for 
the winter. All 53 members of the community par-
ticipate in Work Day, where the camp transforms 
into a working, educational space. In my six weeks 
there, I attended class on three different docks, in 
the woods, in a tent on a backpacking trip, in the 
camp kitchen and taught my optional, student-led 
elective class in a treehouse.

All four programs also emphasize isolation. 

Though Camp Kabeyun had perfect cell service 
and sat only a few miles from two towns, NELP’s 
world rarely extended beyond the camp’s grounds. 
Just across Lake Winnipesaukee sat our flashing 
green light of civilization, visible and audible all 
hours of the day. We were self-isolating. 

“ 
We value hard work and simple living at 

NELP
,” the educational philosophy explains. “As a 

way to build a solid foundation for our intellectual 
explorations during the program, free of unneces-
sary distractions.” As it turns out, reading that sen-
tence and living it were two very different things.

During the seven-week academic semesters 

at Deep Springs, no one is allowed 
 
in or out of the 

campus, except the student driver. Camp Davis 
students are allowed to leave only on their off days 
and at their professors’ discretion. NELP students 
can drive into town once a week for supplies or 
stop on the way back from a backpacking trip. Al-
zar students live and study on campuses on two 
continents, but the focus rarely leaves those two 
places unless it’s an expedition. And, of course, 
physical isolation is just the first step. Such small, 
remote communities are key to tight-knit, high-
functioning ones. 

“You just have to have higher expectations of 

your students. They’re embedded in it. They don’t 
get to go home,” Fisher said. “And that’s a privilege. 
That’s a privilege to be able to do without — some 
people need to go home.”

During the last week of NELP
, I attended Maya 

West’s class on Thoreau’s “Civil Disobedience” in 
the art room. Maya has been teaching at NELP for 
years and was probably in the double digits with 
this text, but because this wasn’t a lecture, the les-
son changed every time. A handful of us sat on the 
freshly stained porch, frustrated with each other 

and with what felt like a book devoted to contra-
dictions. Across the camp, another instructor rang 
the bell to signal that class was over, and the group 
split off into different directions to unwind. Maya 
and I walked to the kitchen together (for week five, 
we both worked for the lunch crew). 

“Honestly, where does Thoreau get off?” I 

asked, exasperated. “He comes from a huge seat of 
privilege to be able to refuse government services 
on the grounds that he, himself, is in a position of 
not needing it.”

Maya swung open the screen door as Sayali 

Amin, a fellow student, walked in from the mess 
hall. A rising junior in LSA who splits her time 
between studying neuroscience, English and 
working in The Daily’s newsroom, she’d taped the 
NELP flyer to her refrigerator weeks before she 
applied. 

As we went through the walk-in fridge for 

leftovers, heated-up stew and washed lettuce, 
our frustration with Thoreau’s essays spilled over 
into the cooking. We kept poking at his ideas, ask-
ing questions while chopping vegetables, until we 
plated the food and I felt like I’d finally cracked 
open the meaning of his writing.

“Learning never ended,” Amin said months lat-

er on the couches of The Daily newsroom. “Which 
was really cool. It just kind of bled through ev-
ery part of your day, like into your meals and into 
cooking and into cleaning and everything that I 
really appreciated where it just never felt isolated. 
It never felt super concentrated and it never felt 
overwhelming.” 

The emphasis on community in alternative 

education landscapes is essential to the entire 
operation. NELP and Deep Springs thrive on a 
co-op style of living, where everyone contributes 
and cultivates the living environment. At Deep 
Springs, work shifts divide up the farm, ranch and 
everyday chores. Each rotation typically lasts for 
two months. “The labor pillar is valued most for 
its pedagogical function,” the college explains. It’s 
designed to harbor responsibility, trust, leadership, 
and appreciation for everything in your commu-
nity. NELP conducts interviews during the appli-
cation process, but I didn’t realize until after that 
it was mostly to see who would — and wouldn’t 
—thrive in such a small community. There is no 
invisible janitorial or kitchen staff to ensure camp 
runs smoothly and food appears when the dinner 
bell is rung.

“There’s an obvious necessity to the work we 

do here,” Michael Leger, a 2016 Deep Springs 
graduate, explained about the school. “Cows need 
to be fed. The garbage needs to be taken out. Eggs 
need to be rinsed so that they can be used for 
breakfast. You need to take your responsibilities 
seriously because there are immediate and urgent 
consequences if you don’t do your job well.” These 
programs are framed as educational experiences, 
with the understanding that education doesn’t 
come solely from classes. 

At Deep Springs, current students choose the 

next class, and about 200-300 people apply for 
12-15 spots. After writing six essays and sitting for 
interviews, a small portion of the pool spends a few 
days at the school. They mimic Deep Springs life to 
see if it’s the right fit for them. Maybe, more impor-
tantly, it’s a test to see if they’re the right fit for Deep 
Springs. All of these programs assemble a class of 
strangers, place them into an isolated area, add on 
pressures like academics, a new environment and 
shared responsibilities, then use whatever hap-
pens as teaching moments. 

With that community comes redesigned rela-

tionships, specifically between students and teach-
ers. Sometimes, own the third day of a backpacking 
trip, an instructor gets tired. They’re hungry, some-
one in the group twists their ankle and everyone’s 
frustrated. The instructor is only human, and that’s 
just as much of a learning opportunity as when a 
professor lectures to a roomful of scribbling hands. 
It’s just different material.

risa Lico grew up in Ra-
vonik, Albania in a tiny vil-
lage surrounded by moun-

tains. For the first eight years of her 
life, she lived on a farm, in a two-
bedroom house with 12 other fam-
ily members. They grew their own 
food and produced their own milk 
and cheese, traveling to the nearby 
city of Korçë only in the wintertime 
when they needed groceries. Until 
moving to the United States in 2008, 
Irisa had never met a Black or Asian 
person. She had never been exposed 
to any culture other than her own.

“In my village, we only had one 

shade of (makeup) foundation be-
cause everybody looked the same,” 
Irisa told me during a Zoom call last 
week. 

It was a Tuesday afternoon, and 

Irisa and I were chatting about cul-
ture — hers, Albanian; mine, Bul-
garian. As she called in from her 
parents’ house in Westland, Mich., 
and I from my college apartment in 
Ann Arbor, Mich., we laughed over 
our loud families, the bowl-cuts we 
endured as children and the cryptic 
recipes our mothers have shared 
with us. (What does “adding a fin-
ger” of something even mean?)

As a child of immigrants, I have 

recently been contemplating which 
parts of my cultural background I 
can claim as my own and how my 
identity will change as I move out 
of my parents’ home. While I’m bi-
lingual and consider myself in touch 
with my Bulgarian side, I’m not sure 
if I will choose to reside in Bulgaria, 
let alone have children with another 
Bulgarian. And though starting my 
own family is still very much a dis-
tant event, I feel a pressure looming: 
Will my family’s Bulgarian heritage 

— in language, tradition, identity — 
end with me?

I wondered if other first- or 

second-generation Americans feel 
the same. For those who immigrat-
ed here, was facing assimilation a 
choice between remaining loyal to 
old traditions or fully adapting to 
American values? Did they have to 
pick one culture to reign over the 
other, or do they exist in perfect bal-
ance? For those like me, who are 
born and bred in the U.S., do they 
worry they are too far removed from 
their parents’ culture to properly 
pass down that legacy?

Irisa, who has lived in the U.S. 

for over a decade, described how 
changing her political and social 
mindset was necessary evolution, 
albeit one that took a number of 
years to accomplish.

“I was eight years old (when I 

moved to the U.S.). I remember be-
ing so anti-everything. I think I was 
even a Republican in 2008,” she said 
with a laugh. She explained that like 
many rural Albanians, her conserva-
tism was largely borne out of a lack 
of exposure to anything different 
from what is expected.

“Racial issues, issues within the 

LBGT community — I was not ex-
posed to those kinds of conflicts,” 
she said. “I was just in Albania 
where ‘race wasn’t a thing’, and 
‘sexuality wasn’t a thing’.”

As she spoke, I had a hard time 

envisioning Irisa as a child eagerly 
waving around a McCain flag. Irisa, 
an LSA Junior majoring in Inter-
national Studies and Middle East 
Studies, describes herself today a 
democratic socialist, mentioning 
that “liberal isn’t left enough”. But as 
she explained moving from an Alba-

nian village of about 1,000 people to 
metro Detroit, that juxtaposition of 
past and current beliefs made a little 
more sense. 

“I understand why Albanians 

think the way they do back home,” 
Irisa said. “But coming to the U.S. 
and learning, and going to a super 
diverse school... having my best 
friends from all different cultures — 
they taught me so much about their 
identities and the issues that they 
face in their own communities.”

It’s an inspiring point, and while 

listening to her, I felt within me a 
small twinge of patriotism. Indeed, 
the U.S. is a melting pot, a salad 
bowl, a meeting point — whatever 
you want to call it. We are a nation 
built by immigrants and home to 
nearly 45 million of them. There are 
over 350 languages spoken within 
our borders. Our economy depends 
on the contributions of immigrants. 
Despite the hateful and exclusion-
ary rhetoric of former U.S. President 
Donald Trump and his followers, a 
majority of Americans still believe in 
a diverse, welcoming nation.

For Irisa, that diversity is one of 

the few tethers that make her feel 
connected — and even proud — to 
be an American.

“I appreciate America in terms 

of the different cultures that I’ve 
learned about, and that makes me 
proud to be an American,” Irisa said. 
“But with anything else — I don’t 
have a strong connection to the U.S... 
I don’t want to live here for the rest 
of my life.”

I wondered if that was an easy 

conclusion to come to. Were there 
other aspects of American culture 
that would be hard to leave behind? 

“There’s no culture,” she said. 

“What is the American culture? 
Like, McDonald’s?”

***
One of the things Batuhan Akçay 

misses most from home is getting 
together with his friends for “cry 
sessions.” 

Batuhan, a first-year master’s 

student studying computer science, 
moved to the U.S. from Turkey four 
years ago to attend the Univer-
sity of Michigan as an undergradu-
ate. When we spoke over Zoom, it 
was nighttime, and he laughed as I 
probed for more information about 
the aforementioned “cry sessions.” 

“Turkish people like to listen to a 

lot of sad songs,” Batuhan said. “We 
have these kinds of cry sessions with 
friends — some people do cry, some 
people don’t. But like, we love being 
in a really romantic, depressing en-
vironment sometimes, listening to 
music.”

I think I would love Turkey, I 

thought to myself — I am also a fan 
of creating romantic, depressing en-
vironments. But as our conversation 
progressed, and laughter turned 
into seriousness, I noticed parallels 
between Batuhan’s perception of 
the U.S. and those of the other first- 
and second-generation Americans I 
had spoken to.

“When I was in Turkey, I never 

thought about cultures that much, 
because Turkey is very mono-cul-
tured,” Batuhan said. “A lot of the 
people are very similar and act in 
certain ways, but when I came to 
the U.S., when I saw people from 
many different backgrounds, many 
cultures, then I realized the impor-
tance of cultures and how (culture) 
affects people’s lives.”

Like Albania, Turkey is relatively 

homogenous, with the majority of 
the population being Muslim and 
ethnically Turkish. For this reason, 
Batuhan explained, many people 
share similar ideologies and have 
trouble understanding issues faced 
by minorities.

Again, this struck me. When I 

had been thinking about my Bul-
garian culture, and how to main-
tain it, I figured this would be an 
attempt done in spite of the U.S., 
not by way of it. But talking to Batu-
han and Irisa made me wonder if 
culture is best celebrated when it 
evolves — not when it is carefully 
polished and delicately handed 
down to the next generation. May-
be, I thought, my hybrid version of 
Bulgarian-American culture is ac-
tually a necessary one.

“The way I view life and people 

and cultures is that some of them 
are better in some ways, some of 
them are worse in some ways,” 
Batuhan said. “To be able to survive 
in a different environment with 
people from different cultures, dif-
ferent mindsets, you have to adapt 
yourself … some of the things that 
come from your culture — you will 
have to let them go.”

Batuhan said that one aspect of 

Turkish culture that he rejects is a 
patriarchal mindset.

“Turkey is very patriarchal,” 

Batuhan said. “I would say like a 

typical Turkish man, they would 
want their wife to be at home, just 
cooking or cleaning, taking care of 
the kid.”

He said that the general Turkish 

population also has a problematic 
mindset surrounding sexuality.

“They believe that being gay, 

or bisexual or transgender are not 
good things and they think of them 
as like, ‘Oh you’re committing a sin,’” 
Batuhan said. 

Batuhan explained that even be-

fore moving to the U.S., he mostly 
rejected this mindset because he 
had exposure to different cultures 
through travel and education. Still, 
like Irisa, moving to the U.S. helped 
him learn more about and solidify 
his views on equality, whether it be 
through talking with LGBTQ+ peers 
or women in his STEM classes.

This is not to say that Batuhan — 

nor myself, nor should you — views 
Turkey as a wholly close-minded 
place and the U.S. as a haven for 
acceptance. It was clear from our 
conversation that Batuhan is deeply 
proud of his Turkish identity, and 
that while he aims to raise his family 
in the U.S., this decision is not based 
on some fairytale ideal of the Ameri-
can Dream. Like many immigrants, 
his is rooted in factors that tran-
scend abstract feelings of belonging 
and homeland. 

“The reason I would like to live 

in the U.S. in the future is that the 
politics and economy in Turkey is 
not that great,” Batuhan said. “And I 
don’t think I’ll be able to have a de-
cent life out there, both ideologically 
and financially... In the future, if it 
was the case that the politics change, 
the economy changes, and Turkey is 
back again as a vibrant country, then 
I would actually like to go back.”

Indeed, the diversity that Batu-

han and Irisa mentioned ranks low 
on the reasons immigrants choose 
to move to the U.S., according to a 
study conducted by the U.S. Depart-
ment of State. Economic and edu-
cational opportunities clearly rank 
higher, and more so, the fact that 
there is diversity in the U.S. doesn’t 
necessarily mean it is celebrated. 
When Irisa told me about the mi-
sogyny that women in Albania face, 
she didn’t note the U.S. as its inverse 
of perfect equality. She noted it as a 
step up. When Batuhan mentioned 
the diversity of cultures in the U.S., 
he didn’t indicate celebratory, com-
munal potlucks. He actually later la-
mented how individualistic Ameri-
cans can be.

In an age of increasing national-

ism, it is dangerous to inaccurately 
categorize people and places into 
binary camps: the “backwards, left-
behind” nations of the East versus 
the “modern, progressive” West. 
It also made me realize that my 
search for a strong sense of Bulgar-
ian identity could play into this trib-
alist sorting. Trying to “pick a side” 
or determine which culture is better 
to identify with is not merely impos-
sible, but destructive to any move-
ment towards inclusion.

I 

was sitting at my kitchen 
counter with my mom 
when I got the notification 

that my “Year in Review” on Snap-
chat had been uploaded for 2020. 
With not much else to do on that 
December morning, I opened the 
application, excited to relive both 
favorite and forgotten memories 
that made up an unparalleled year. 

The review began with a video 

of my uncle on New Year’s Day 
wearing 2020 glasses from the 
night before and dancing with 
strangers on a pool deck — all for 
the entertainment and embar-
rassment of my cousins and me. I 
showed my mom and we laughed. 

“Oh, simpler times. Little did 

we know what was coming,” she 
chuckled. “Show me more.”

After I exhausted the curated 

slideshow of moments, I scrolled 
through other pictures and videos 
from deep within the Snapchat 
memory vault. And so we sat tap-
ping through the entirety of 2020: 
Kobe Bryant’s helicopter crash in 
January, videos of my classroom in 
February on what were then just 
average high school days. Con-
tinuing to tap through, we reached 
March 12, which showed a video 
of my friend screaming at the caf-
eteria table. 

“This is literally not a big deal,” 

he yelled. “All the scientists are 
saying they don’t know why every-
one’s freaking out. Everyone needs 
to calm down!” 

At the counter, my mom and I 

laughed and shook our heads at 
the irony and naivete in his con-
fident, assertive voice. Little did 
my friend know what was coming 
either. A video from the next day 
records the dean’s voice coming 
over the high school’s loudspeaker 
announcing we would not be re-
turning to school until a week af-
ter spring break. 

Ah, the beginning of the end. 

We kept watching — it was like a 
movie.

But as my mom and I observed 

my life unfold in pictures and vid-
eos, I began to think about the 
medium through which we tell 
stories and recall memories. I re-
alized that my understanding of 
my family members’ lives before I 
came into them are based primar-
ily on their words, rather than re-
corded images.

This is especially true for my 

grandfather. For as long as I can 
remember, I’ve listened to him 
outline scenes from his life with 
humor, wit and great detail. His 
most colorful stories take place 
during the Great Depression. He 
tells of his days as a peanut sales-
man when he and his dad stood on 
the corner trading nuts for nickels. 
Other favorites include the year he 
refused to go to school because he 
was scared of the garbage man — 
after watching his father beat the 
guy up in his driveway for catcall-
ing his mother, he hid under the 
couch every time the truck ar-
rived. There was the time he made 
his “ma” pick him up from Camp 
Freedom after they forced him to 
catch bologna sandwiches flung 
from a truck. He also frequent-
ly details his performances as a 
Vaudeville dancer and how he tap-
danced on stage with his graceful 

mother and father in glory. He 
tells the story of when he was held 
up at gunpoint while working the 
cash register at his dad’s currency 
exchange, and of the first time 
he saw my grandma in Eli’s Deli, 
though she was uninterested in his 
introduction at the time. 

From his words, my mind con-

cocts its own videos. Characters 
since passed away come to life in 
my head through his anecdotes. 
My grandfather’s stories make me 
laugh without fail, usually because 
of the plot or his word choice. But 
what stands out to me the most is 
the ambiguity surrounding the line 
between what actually happened 
during those harrowing times and 
what he relays, because the truth 
of it all is so unknown. Only my 
grandfather was at the scene of 
the hysterical, terrifying or beau-
tiful stories he tells — there’s no 
other documentation of the man’s 
colorful life. I just have to take his 
word for it.

Meanwhile, my mom and I are 

able to visually witness a moment 
from almost every day of my past 
year. We reach the end of win-
ter: a video of my family crowded 
around puzzles in the dining room, 
a picture of me on the couch, my 
prom dress stretched over my 
sweatpants and my hair in a tan-
gled bun. We watch spring turn to 
summer: a video of me pressing a 
button, committing to the Univer-
sity of Michigan. There’s us walk-
ing my dog and us in the backseat 
of our car on rides to nowhere. We 
see us at a Black Lives Matter pro-
test, chanting with thousands of 
strangers. There’s my dad sweat-
ing in my residence hall room suf-
focated by layers of masks as he 
attempts to loft my bed during my 
move into college. 

There are more stories to tell 

my children or grandchildren one 
day about the year 2020 than in 
the entirety of an ordinary decade. 
Maybe my grandfather would say 
the same about his experiences 
during the Depression. But unlike 
my grandfather’s past, my experi-
ences will never boil down to my 
word alone. Many of my genera-
tion’s experiences are document-
ed, and I think that’s fascinating. 

Moments that might become 

stories, along with moments that 
might have otherwise faded from 
my mind, remain pristine and 
permanent on my phone: videos 
of me sitting in my residence hall 
room with fear in my eyes as John 
King outlines the beginning of the 
election returns, of my friends 
and I screaming in our pajamas 
as we read the email announcing 
that freshman housing contracts 
would be canceled for winter se-
mester, of the moment Biden won 
the presidency. I have smaller 
moments too: the (masked) faces, 
Zingerman’s sandwiches, break-
out rooms and Zoom shenanigans. 
It’s all there, in living color. 

Not only is Generation Z’s ev-

eryday life documented, it’s shared 
and 
it’s 
communal. 
Through 

memes on Instagram, Twitter and 
many TikToks, Gen-Z has the abil-
ity to bask in shared experiences. 
We have the benefit of processing 
and coping together — often with 
humor — in the moment. Wheth-

er videos record a person’s funny 
conversation with their therapist, 
tragic relationship stories or the 
miseries of quarantine, I watch 
and know that millions of people 
are watching (and often laughing) 
with me. In that, there is vulner-
ability, connectedness and under-
standing. 

I wonder what this means for 

our generation. Something about 
it makes me hopeful. I believe, un-
like previous generations, we have 
a heightened understanding of 
what makes us human, what pains 
us, what gives us joy and how 
we’re more similar than differ-
ent. Hopefully, we’ll grow up with 
these shared sentiments in mind 
and become leaders who make de-
cisions based on them, not blind to 
them. 

Yes, perhaps, with our experi-

ences documented we will lose 
the magic of storytelling. When 
I’m able to pull up a video for my 
kids of my friends’ cars parked in a 
circle while we yelled at each oth-
er across an empty parking lot af-
ter being locked in our homes for 
three months, the aforementioned 
line between what actually hap-
pened and the way they perceive 
it will be less blurred. The possi-
bility of the extinction of imagina-
tion, embellishment and freedom 

to concoct pictures in the mind is 
upsetting. This begs the question: 
Would my grandfather recall his 
childhood stories the same way if 
he had documentation of them? 

Something tells me the answer 

is no. Memories change with age, 
and there is something to be said 
for revisionist history. From living 
through 2020, I understand how 
surviving the Depression would’ve 
been traumatic and painstak-
ing, yet my grandfather’s stories 
sometimes seem romantic. I fear 
his Camp Freedom story wouldn’t 
follow quite the same plotlines or 
have the same colorful commen-
tary if he had a Snapchat memory 
of it. But I also think about what 
I’d give to see footage of a 15-year-
old version of my 90-year-old 
grandfather tap dancing on a stage 
or standing on the street corner 
selling peanuts with his dad whom 
I’ve never met. 

For the sake of knowledge, un-

derstanding and truth, I think our 
generation and those to follow 
possess something powerful. As 
we’ve seen through recent times, 
blurry lines, as magical as they may 
be, can also be dangerous, and fact 
is important. Perhaps storytelling 
according to memory will be sac-
rificed for tangible documentation 
of others’ different realities. May-

be that’s a positive sacrifice to be 
made. People may no longer be as 
ignorant about the lives and histo-
ry that came before them, or about 
the lives, feelings and sentiments 
of people surrounding them at 
the moment. People may not have 
the ability to dismiss others’ reali-
ties, either. After all, a viral video 
documenting the truth of George 
Flloyd’s death sparked the BLM 
protests this year.

For better or for worse, as I 

scrolled through my 2020 on 
Snapchat, I was acutely aware that 
the way we relay experiences has 
changed forever. For 2020’s sake, 
I’m glad. I don’t think I’d have 
the energy to rehash the year in 
words alone. I’ll need the help of 
all Snapchat memories, TikToks, 
videos and memes I can get.

I closed out of the applica-

tion and took a picture of my 
mom at the kitchen counter. My 
half-finished smoothie, her dai-
ly crossword puzzle and a Time 
magazine with President Joe 
Biden and Vice President Ka-
mala Harris as its “Person of the 
Year” on the cover cluttered the 
table. Behind her on the televi-
sion, NBC covered the distribu-
tion of the first vaccines. Now 
that’s a good one, I thought. I 
saved it for the memories.

For the 
memories

ILLUSTRATION BY MAGGIE WIEBE

L

ike many milestones that 
make their anticipated en-
trance throughout adoles-

cence — among them the first kiss, 
first date and the other usual sus-
pects — my first time driving was 
awkward 
but 
wholesome. 
After 

months of tedious driver’s education 
coursework and haphazardly pre-
pared traffic sign note cards, I was 
finally ready to take to the road. Per 
Indiana law, I was required to sup-
plement my online driver’s ed with a 
handful of driving lessons — the last 
step before I would finally be able to 
make the coveted march into the De-
partment of Motor Vehicles and take 
my driver’s test. 

Most of the kids in my grade took 

driver’s ed from the same online 
academy, so the program’s pool of 
driving instructors had become a 
sort of cast of characters often gos-
siped about between the drivers-
to-be. In geometry or English class, 
I would hear the latest tale of the 
frizzy-haired instructor who spent 
the majority of the lessons ranting 
about her relationship problems, or 
about the pale-faced man who kept 
his clammy hands gripped around 
his clipboard during each drive. As I 
listened to my peers exchange lesson 
anecdotes like cigars in a boys’ club, 
I was eager to graduate into this 
sphere of driving adventure.

And then my time finally came. My 

mom offered me a swift “good luck!” 
before dropping me off in my high 
school parking lot, where my instruc-
tor would soon take me out for my 
first lesson. I was met by a friendly 
older man clad in a gray windbreaker 
and black slacks, standing in front of 
a silver car plastered with driver’s ed 
logos. He had a wispy mustache, the 
kind that reminded me of my grand-
father. After firmly shaking my hand 
with the seriousness of a business 
deal, he gestured me towards the 
driver’s seat — the seat. The star of 
today’s outing. 

“You can call me Clarence,” he 

said, buckling his seatbelt and fidg-
eting with the paper and clipboard in 
his lap. I glanced at his handwriting, 
which was scribbly and hurried, like 
a substitute teacher’s. 

“Ready to finally take to the open 

road?” he asked. 

I offered a reluctant nod before 

turning the keys in the ignition, 
prompting a low, growled rumble 
from the vehicle and a pang of ex-
citement in my chest. 

I was driving. 
***
Often heralded as the epitome of 

freedom in a country long claiming 
to be the land of the free, we’ve come 
to believe there is something sacred 

about the first time an American gets 
behind the wheel. The sensation of 
taking the open road, hands gripped 
onto a leathery steering wheel, bask-
ing in the power of utter control: 
We’re driving towards an idealistic 
future only American-born individu-
alism can breed. 

Surrounding media has branded 

this kind of experience as one of “ad-
venture” and “exploration,” supple-
mented by commercials of sleek Jeep 
Wranglers and beastly SUVs shown 
conquering rocky terrain. And to-
wards the end of each advertise-
ment, a gritty, all-American narrator 
tells you this automobile is for trail-
blazers, the American pioneer — the 
white-colonial, anti-indigenous nar-
rative blazes red, white and blue in 
the advertisement’s final remarks. 
To own a car is to assume the tropes 
that have long defined what it means 
to be American: To charge (or drive) 
boldly in the direction of the Ameri-
can dream, and a rugged conquest 
awaits. 

The archetype carries into liter-

ary manifestations as well: Arthur 
Miller’s 1949 stage play “Death of a 
Salesman” casts protagonist Willy 
Loman’s American-made Chevrolet 
as the principal symbol of his endur-
ing struggle to realize the American 
Dream. In the climax of the piece, 
Loman drives the car out into the 
darkness, ultimately leading to the 
termination of his life and the figu-
rative death of his ambitions. And in 
F. Scott Fitzgerald’s 1925 novel “The 
Great Gatsby,” the titular character’s 
Rolls-Royce is drooled upon by nar-
rator Nick Carraway, who prizes the 
“rich,” “triumphant” vehicle as the 
ultimate sign of luxury, wealth and 
success.

It wasn’t until I purchased my first 

car that I began to truly reflect on 
how these tropes of car ownership 
as freedom, as American individual-
ism, as wealth deeply affected me as 
a teenager.

I was a young person with the li-

cense to drive but nothing to drive 
with.

The process of changing that title 

started a few days into this winter 
break. My best friend from home had 
just driven me from Ann Arbor to In-
diana, and I was soon due back up to 
northern Michigan, where I would 
purchase a well-loved Chevy from 
my uncle. 

Like most used vehicles, the car 

was bestowed upon me along with 
a list of imperfections, including a 
leaky gas tank that needed to be ex-
amined right away. My first few days 
of car ownership were littered with 
trips to AutoZone and my dad en-
dearingly poking at parts of the en-

gine to ensure everything functioned 
properly. Finally, after substantial 
analysis, I was cleared to drive the 
car back home, where I was eager to 
accessorize her with all the essential 
features: an aux chord, a pine-scent-
ed air freshener and feminist bumper 
stickers. (To my dismay, my mother 
vetoed my “Keep Your Laws Off My 
Body” sticker for a fear of it provok-
ing other drivers on the road against 
me).

Almost immediately, I formed an 

oddly admirative connection with 
this car-turned-friend, and I knew 
I wanted to name her. Her slightly-
dented black exterior and silver de-
tailing inspired me to go with some-
thing mysterious, like a wise old 
witch who had lived a hundred lives 
before this one. After lots of delib-
eration with friends and family, she 
was named Svetlana.

After the arduous process of trans-

ferring the title of the car then reg-
istering it in my name, I was finally 
able to take to the open road in my 
own car. I quickly classified myself 
as a car owner as if I’d been promoted 
to some imagined, glistening sphere 
of superior beings. But why I felt so 
prideful to be cruising with the Gats-
bys of the world, I did not yet fully 
recognize.
I

n the weeks following Svet-
lana’s adoption, when I would 
drive around the streets of my 

hometown — a picture-perfect sub-
urb tucked north of Indianapolis — 
I found myself surveying the same 
flurries of Jeep Wranglers and BMWs 
I was once so accustomed to seeing. I 
remembered high school: countless, 
dewy mornings vibrating with the 
excitement of these sleek vehicles 
buzzing through the parking lot. And 
the dreaded seventh-period-bell that 
emancipated those lucky license-
carriers to their same cushy wagons, 
with me pitifully departing on foot. 

I remembered all the weekdays 

that began with one red-nosed walk 
to school — in rain, snow, slush, sleet 
and sun. That one, short commute 
felt hours long as I fixed my gaze 
towards the ground, attempting to 
avoid eye contact with anyone who 
might pass by and pity the upper-
classman with no car to drive. 

The end of the school day proved 

more difficult; the street parallel to 
my high school was always immedi-
ately flushed with a parade of stu-
dent traffic in the minutes following 
the final bell. This meant crossing 
a stampede of student drivers, all 
with their car radios blaring, win-
dows down, sitting cool with a kind 
of eased cockiness all upper-middle-
class kids seem to inherit. My task 
was simple: stay on the sidewalk and 

wait patiently for an opening in the 
mass of vehicles to make my pattering 
escape to the other side of the street. 
But in high school, in front of those 
drivers, the endeavor seemed disas-
trous, fatally embarrassing even. 

I then thought of my junior year, 

when my brother and I shared a 
used 1995 Ford Mustang during its 
last months before it broke down. I 
thought of all of the times I sheep-
ishly avoided driving friends so 
they wouldn’t see my rickety pair of 
wheels, the small convertible cower-
ing in comparison to my town’s bri-
gade of SUVs. During after-school 
hours, I made sure to borrow my 
parents’ nicer, newer car when visit-
ing friends’ houses, my body tensing 
at the thought of my decrepit Mus-
tang acting as the sore spot of some 
Crest-white neighborhood made up 
of brick mansions and money-green 
lawns.

Recalling these things meant con-

fronting a brutal classist ideation I 
had long carried since high school: 
a fear that my peers would know my 
family wasn’t as wealthy as theirs.

In retrospect, I feel a little ashamed 

knowing that I grew up in this cushy 
suburb, went to a well-funded pub-
lic high school, had a loving family, a 
warm home and so many other privi-
leges yet still engaged with the hall-
marks of class envy, treating a stroll 
to school like a walk of shame. 

And truthfully, acquiring my first 

set of wheels proved to be as under-
whelming as anything my adolescent 
self once treasured, the first kisses 
and the prom dances and the home-
coming games. The transaction was 
not magical; It did not grant me some 
kind of divine confidence I once 
thought was only earned via a breezy 
drive to high school. It didn’t make 
me prettier or richer or more of an 
adventurer. 

And therein lies the issue cre-

ated when American-brand indus-
trial efforts are intensely amplified 
by streams of literary and media 
messaging. To me, to us, a car has 
always been more than a car. It is a 
vessel with which we conquer new 
terrain, like colonizers on wheels. 
It is a throne on which we display 
wealth. It is a launchpad from which 
we reach for some vastly unattain-
able version of ourselves. And for 
whatever reason, it took finally sit-
ting behind my own wheel to see that 
all of these things a car is ‘supposed’ 
to represent fizzle down to nothing. 
The view beyond the wheel is no 
grander than it was before. The only 
thing that’s changed is the girl who 
once took her first driver’s lesson, 
who grew up a little bit the day she 
bought her first car.

uly 1st, 2019. The morning was 
bright as I hiked with my dad, my 
aunt and her family on the coast 

of Northern California — the so-called “Lost 
Coast.” The day was warm and only a few wisps 
of clouds were visible in the blue sky along the 
edge of the coast. The smell of salt filled my 
nostrils. The shushing sound of the powerful 
Pacific Ocean toiling against the rough, dark 
rocks and sandy shore joined with the soft 
whistle of the wind to create a soundtrack of 
white noise, punctuated by the seagulls’ harsh 
cries. 

We arrived at the Punta Gorda Lighthouse, 

a lone figure standing along the wild west 
coast, not long after detouring around a rattle-
snake sunning itself in the middle of the trail 
along the top of the beach. 

Just past that lighthouse, lying out on the 

fine gray sand of the beach, were a colony of el-
ephant seals. They didn’t appear to be the most 
graceful of creatures with their enormous stat-
ure, blubbery bodies and huge bulbous noses. 
And while I typically can identify most animals 
quickly, I was at first puzzled because I had 
never seen these creatures in person before. 
The Northern Elephant Seal makes its home 
off the coast of Mexico and Southern Califor-
nia, while its larger Southern cousin makes 
its home in the cold waters of Antarctica. The 
Northern Elephant Seal, a colony of which I 
found before me, can weigh over two tons and 
can easily crush a human. Growing up on the 
coast of Northern California and hiking there 
now, the only marine mammals I had ever 
encountered were sea lions, which are much 
smaller with sleeker bodies, longer flippers 
and cute, pointy noses. Yet, as I realized what 
I saw in front of me was in fact the Northern 
Elephant seal out of its natural habitat, I found 
myself drawn to these majestic creatures, de-
spite the clownishness of their appearance. 

With a demanding curiosity, I crept closer 

to them, keeping a large log between myself 
and the mostly slumbering giants. One indi-
vidual seal close to me opened her eye, then 
closed it again, deeming me too small to be a 
threat. My family watched the seals from a safe 
distance away, warning me warily to stop being 
reckless. I waved away their concern as I cir-
cled cautiously around the colony. These giants 
can move quickly over land when they want to, 

their blubber rippling like water as they lum-
ber forward. I was slower on the loose, dry 
sand, my shoes dragging no matter how lightly 
I tried to step. I watched in fascination from 
around the curve of a grassy hill as two males 
fought, their sharp teeth gouging into each oth-
er’s already-scarred flesh. I counted around 40 
individual seals, in awe of their presence and 
large quantity. 

What were they doing there, far away from 

where they were supposed to be? I remem-
bered when a Great White Shark washed up 
on the beach and how it’s not uncommon to 
see sea lions, but I couldn’t recall ever hearing 
of elephant seals this far north. And when I had 
backpacked this same trail with my father and 
brother in the past around the same time of 
year, they certainly weren’t there. 

Later that day, we talked to a park ranger 

who said they in fact had come farther north 
from their usual beaches and began showing 
up in Punta Gorda “around a year ago.” 

While this statement may appear insig-

nificant to some, its implications stayed with 
me. Later that summer while studying at St. 
Peter’s College at Oxford University for an 
abroad program, I did some research. The 
most helpful source I found on the subject 
was a book titled “Elephant Seals: Popula-
tion Ecology, Behavior, and Physiology.” One 
map in it showed the locations of rookeries, 
or elephant seal breeding colonies, as of 1991 
and their alleged historical locations. The his-
torical rookeries extend south to Mexico and 
north past San Francisco, but not to Punta 
Gorda. 

Within the 28 years between 1991 and 2019, 

the elephant seals migrated about 280 miles 
north of their historical northernmost rookery, 
about 10 miles a year. 

But why was this so? 
I guess the circumstances were right for me 

to be thinking about this question, as my study 
abroad program that summer focused on an-
thropogenic climate change. At some point, I 
made the connection that it is climate change 
that is affecting the patterns of these animals. 

It’s well established that climate change is 

causing rising atmospheric temperatures. But 
oceans absorb a lot of the heat that would oth-
erwise be absorbed by the atmosphere. The 
Environmental Protection Agency shows a re-

cent rise in ocean heat content above the 1971-
2000 average, which is consistent across differ-
ent measurement sources. 

There is evidence that distributions of ma-

rine mammals are changing as climate chang-
es. It is possible that as ocean temperatures rise, 
the elephant seals are moving farther north to 
waters that are more comfortable or which 
provide better access to food sources. 

And while this one instance may serve as 

a key indicator of the significance of climate 
change, its impact on living organisms is not 
confined to the oceans, nor is it confined to ani-
mals. Plant distributions can also be affected by 
climate change as temperatures and precipita-
tion levels change. 

Even the smallest of creatures can be af-

fected by temperature changes, as shown 
by one of the EPA’s climate change indica-
tors, Lyme disease. Occurrences of Lyme 
disease have been rising steadily since the 
1990s. Lyme disease is caused by a bacteria 
called Borrelia burgdorferi, which can be 
carried in a certain species of tick called a 
deer tick. Ticks infected with this bacteria, 
when biting a human or animal, can trans-
mit Lyme disease. The illness causes skin 
rash, fatigue and joint pain; if left untreat-
ed, the illness can cause Lyme arthritis and 
nervous system complications. Deer ticks 
are active when temperatures are above 45 
degrees Fahrenheit and prefer areas with 
85% humidity. Global warming is expand-
ing the range of deer ticks, increasing the 
prevalence of health hazards in humans 
and animals by spreading Lyme disease to 
new populations and areas. 
T

his occurrence has important im-
plications for the state of Michi-
gan. In July 2020, it became 

clear that Lyme disease is becoming more 
prevalent in Northern Michigan and other 
parts of the state. 

Unlike humans, who regulate the envi-

ronment to survive, animals and plants and 
even bacteria rely upon climate to provide 
hospitable conditions. If the environment 
in which they can live expands, so will their 
distribution patterns, and if the 
environment is no longer hospita-
ble, they will move to a place that 
is hospitable. As shown by the el-

ephant seals I encountered a year and a half 
ago, the results of climate change are hap-
pening right before our eyes. 

Climate change does not only affect the 

climate; it has the potential to affect species 
of animals and plants and as a result, the dis-
tributions of diseases like Lyme disease. By 
paying attention to such signs and not dis-
missing them as unexplained coincidences, 
we acknowledge the impact that we as hu-
mans have on the natural environment.

When I think of the far-reaching conse-

quences of anthropogenic climate change, I 
think of the time I saw the elephant seals. 
The changes that are occurring are far more 
than changes in the weather — they affect 
the ecology of the places we live. And re-
gardless of what we consider ourselves to 
be, we are animals, too. We can brace our-
selves for the impact of climate change by 
recognizing when our actions have affected 
the environment, and respond adequately 
by anticipating what other consequences 
climate change may have. 

Our disconnection from the environment 

ends when we encounter animals where 
they’re not supposed to be, when the plants 
that grew in a place before don’t grow there 
as well anymore because of drought, when 
a disease spreads to a new region. We are 
not as separate from the environment as we 
may think, and the consequences are ap-
parent in strange, seemingly innocuous oc-
currences — like the elephant seals on the 
beach. 

After lunch on the hill above the el-

ephant seals, we headed back the way we 
had come, the lighthouse being the prede-
termined turning-back point of our hike. It 
was almost as if, without knowing it, we had 
come all this way just to see the elephant 
seals: an anomaly of climate change that 
may become a norm in the years to come. 

Signs like these are a lighthouse, guiding 

our ship through treacherous waters so that 
we don’t hit the sharp rocks of the coast and 
sink. It is our decision whether to pay atten-
tion to them or not.

At 9:01 p.m. on Friday night, 

Chaundee Brown stood near 

halfcourt, dribbling out the 

waning seconds of the Michigan 

men’s basketball team’s decisive 

victory over Purdue in West 

Lafayette. 
His 
teammates 

danced on the sidelines behind 

him, serenading themselves with 

a chorus of cheers and high-fives. 

The final buzzer blared. Players 

and coaches bounced diagonally 

across the court, faces clad in 

smiles and disappeared one-by-

one up the tunnel. 

We don’t know when we’ll see 

them again. 

Saturday, news broke that 

all Michigan athletic teams 

would enter a two-week pause, 

beginning on Jan. 24, due to an 

influx of positive cases of the 

novel COVID-19 B.1.1.7 variant 

amongst 
several 
Michigan 

programs. At a minimum, the 

men’s basketball team will miss 

four games — against Penn State, 

Indiana, 
Northwestern 
and 

Michigan State. It could miss 

more. 

“We all just tell each other 

you gotta be grateful for every 

game we play because you 

never know, the next game can 

get canceled,” senior forward 

Isaiah Livers said on Dec. 

9, following Michigan’s win 

over Toledo. “Last year, the 

tournament stuff got taken 

away from us, so we just try 

to be grateful for each day. Be 

blessed, wake up, be excited to 

come to practice, be excited to 

see your brothers because that 

can all go away with three or 

four tests.” 

The 2020-21 college basketball 

season was always going to be 

like this. Making it through 

the schedule unscathed, with 

COVID-19 continuing to ravage 

the nation, would have required 

a near-miracle. 

Michigan now becomes the 

fourth Big Ten team to go on an 

extended pause, joining Penn 

State, Nebraska and Michigan 

State. Penn State went 18 days 

between games. Nebraska has 

been on hiatus since Jan. 10; 

Michigan State last played Jan. 

8. 

Michigan’s 
situation 
is 

unique. As of Saturday, the 

men’s basketball team didn’t 

have any active COVID-19 cases, 

according to David Jesse of the 

Detroit Free Press. Its pause is 

entirely preemptive, indicative 

of 
heightened 
concern 
over 

the novel B.1.1.7 strain, which 

is more contagious than other 

variants of the virus. 

“Health is always number 

one with me,” Michigan coach 

Juwan Howard said on Dec. 

9. “Basketball is last. And I’m 

speaking health as well as 

mental health. … Our guys are 

doing a phenomenal job of doing 

whatever they can — wearing 

their 
masks, 
washing 
their 

hands, staying away from social 

gatherings. They want to play 

basketball. They wanted to have 

a season.” 

In a best-case scenario, the 

Wolverines will return for their 

scheduled Feb. 11 contest with 

Illinois. Should that occur, 20 

days will have passed since 

Michigan last played a game. 

The earliest the team could even 

return to the court for practice is 

Feb. 7. 

The Wolverines previously 

endured a 12-day scheduling 

break 
between 
games 

in 
December, 
making 
a 

prolonged 
absence 
not 

entirely unprecedented. Still, 

unprecedented or not, a hiatus 

creates a new set of problems for 

a team that hasn’t looked like it 

had many.

“When you play a lot of games 

in a row, I feel like you kinda get 

into it a little bit,” sophomore 

forward Franz Wagner said on 

Dec. 23. “The practices before 

the games, the way you prepare. 

And now we didn’t have that 

playing rhythm … that’s the 

difficulty, maybe at the start of 

the game we’ll see that, maybe 

not. But you kinda get out of your 

rhythm if you don’t play for a 

couple days.” 

Again, this break is markedly 

different and all the more 

daunting. All Michigan athletic 

programs, 
men’s 
basketball 

including, are abiding to a strict 

quarantine: No drills, no weight 

room sessions, no scrimmages. 

The 
pause 
occurs 
at 
an 

inopportune 
time 
for 
the 

Wolverines, who climbed to No. 

4 in the nation in the most recent 

AP Poll. They sit alone atop the 

Big Ten — 1.5 games ahead of 

Iowa — and have obliterated 

their 
opponents, 
registering 

double-digit victories in seven 

of their last eight games. A 

conference title is not outside the 

realm of possibility, nor is a long 

run in the NCAA Tournament, 

provided it happens. 

Michigan has operated with 

an unspoken sense of urgency 

this 
season, 
COVID 
aside. 

Five of the eight prominent 

rotation players are seniors. 

Additionally, Wagner seems a 

good bet to enter the NBA Draft 

come May. This season posed 

as a final hurrah for a group 

largely in the twilight of their 

collegiate careers, a chance 

to atone for the crushing 

cancellations that truncated 

last season. 

COVID-19 
always 
ran 

opposite 
to 
those 
plans, 

ominously looming as a threat to 

upend them. Now, in the heart of 

the season, it has. 

Powerless, all Michigan can 

do is wait. 

The entire University of Michigan 

athletic department is on lockdown.

This 
comes 
after 
a 
Michigan 

Department of Health and Human 

Services 
recommendation 
Saturday 

that the University 

suspend 
athletic 

activities as a result 

of the introduction 

and ongoing spread 

of the newest B.1.1.7 

variant of COVID-19 

within the athletic 

department.

The variant — first 

discovered in the United Kingdom — is 

estimated to be around 40-70% more 

infectious than the current SARS-CoV-2 

strain that is COVID-19 as we know it. It 

was brought to Michigan (both the state 

and university) by a Michigan athlete 

traveling from the United Kingdom at 

the start of the winter semester.

Now, with all athletics suspended and 

the entire program subjected to a full 

14-day quarantine, questions arise about 

how this could have happened.

What it comes down to is exactly 

what’s being done right now — two entire 

weeks of isolation.

Currently, the United Kingdom is on 

the CDC’s list of countries with high 

risk travelers, and travel from the UK to 

the United States is prohibited — with a 

few exceptions. Included within those 

exceptions are F-1 student visas and US 

citizens returning to the states, one of 

which the U-M athlete almost certainly 

fell under.

Now, I’m not saying people should 

not be able to return home to the United 

States or that a student should not be 

able to visit their family in the UK and 

come back. That’s not what inherently 

caused the B.1.1.7 outbreak in the athletic 

department. Instead, it’s the inability to 

enforce quarantining on individuals.

The CDC requires a negative COVID-

19 test result one-to-three days prior 

to traveling back to the United States, 

and although that is a good procedure, 

it is the only enforceable step and not 

impervious to the transmission of the 

virus, as proven by the U-M athlete. The 

CDC recommends a 14-day quarantine, 

but at every level, it has no power to 

actually enforce it. 

A lot of the things CDC recommends 

during travel can only be enforced 

by the privately owned, for-profit 

operating airlines who wouldn’t do 

anything to discourage travel because 

they’re already struggling as is. And 

once a passenger lands, they can only 

be regulated by state protocols, which 

have a huge degree of variation from 

mandatory quarantine to not even 

requiring masks.

In Michigan? No travel restrictions. 

No required quarantine. 

At the University of Michigan, we 

can assume the athletic department 

requires a quarantine until a negative 

PCR test after arrival. Unfortunately, 

tests can come back negative despite 

the person being infected with the 

virus. For three to five days after being 

exposed, a PCR test can still turn up 

negative, meaning if a student athlete 

contracted it on any part of their 

journey back to Ann Arbor and tested 

negative up to five days later, it is not 

guaranteed they are virus-free.

But how much difference could a 

full 14-day required quarantine make? 

Honestly, quite a bit.

Just look at Australia, one of the 

more COVID-conscious countries with 

stringent policies:

“All 
international 
travelers 
are 

required to quarantine for 14 days at 

the first point of entry, unless they’re 

granted an exemption upon request,” 

per the Australian health department. 

“Quarantines 
take 
place 
in 
state-

designated facilities and fees depend 

on the state, ranging from $2500 for 

one adult in the Northern Territory 

to $3000 for one adult in New South 

Wales.”

This requires quarantine in a state 

facility, meaning it is truly mandated. 

And though it doesn’t account for the 

entire scope of reduced cases, the 

numbers speak volumes.

Per one million people, Australia has 

1,128.08 cases and 35.65 deaths. The 

United States has 74,868.97 cases and 

1,251 deaths per one million people. 

That’s 67 times the cases and 35 times 

the deaths after being adjusted for 

population.

Quarantining 
and 
other 
COVID 

protocols work, but we don’t have them 

in the state or majority of the country.

There was never a way to prevent 

the B.1.1.7 strain from coming to the 

US, and Michigan for that matter, with 

the current system we have in place. 

It’s unfortunate it came to Ann Arbor 

and is making its way through the 

athletic department, but it was almost 

inevitable.

Michigan 
followed 
all 
Big 
Ten 

protocols and violated no federal or 

state regulations, it’s just that none of 

them were — or are — enough. If the 

athletic department implemented its 

own 14-day mandated quarantine after 

the return, a system-wide pause could 

have been avoided with just one athlete 

taking a pause. 

Now, in a last ditch effort by the 

MDHHS to contain the B.1.1.7 variant, 

Michigan 
shut 
down 
the 
athletic 

department for 14 days. 

If the right regulations were in place 

and enforced, it never would have had to.

 One way or another, a two-week quarantine was necessary

Men’s swim and dive sends off 

Spartans in dual meet win

Implications of 14-day pause 
for the men’s basketball team

Before Friday night’s dual 

meet against rival Michigan 

State (0-1), Michigan coach Mike 

Bottom lectured his team about 

gladiators:

“We talked a little bit about 

in the amphitheaters when they 

used to battle man-on-man, the 

old warrior coming in and the 

new warrior coming in; the old 

warrior knowing that this is his 

last round, the young warrior’s 

going to beat him up,” Bottom 

said. “We talked about what that 

warrior would have said. What 

a true gladiator would have said 

was ‘Give me your best.’ ”

That story played a heavy hand 

in the No. 9 Michigan men’s swim 

and dive team’s (2-1) final regular 

season bout against the Spartans 

due to Michigan State cutting 

the program. During the meet, 

the Wolverines concentrated on 

honoring more than a century of 

competition with their in-state 

foe, focusing not on their 159-77 

victory but rather the meaning 

of the last meet against the 

Spartans.

“I think anybody that looks 

at the Michigan State program 

over the years has got to respect 

them,” Bottom said. “We’re far 

beyond selfish in understanding 

that we wouldn’t be where we are 

without Michigan State.”

That respect took centerstage 

as Michigan put its best efforts 

forth for Michigan State. While 

midseason dual meets can see 

lighter competition, the meet 

had the air of a championship 

grudge match.

For a program devastated by 

transfers, the Spartans came 

close to victory early in races. 

The thinness of their roster 

showed 
down 
the 
stretch, 

though, as Michigan swimmers 

took more commanding leads.

Michigan, in an effort to avoid 

running up the score against an 

undermanned opponent, chose 

not to score many of its racers, 

having them enter as exhibition 

instead. The Wolverines often 

only counted their victor in each 

event, all of which were won by 

Michigan.

“We want to make sure that 

we’re playing on a level playing 

field,” Bottom said. “And when 

Michigan State has lost some of 

their best because of the decisions 

of their administration, we want 

to be able to respect that.”

Winning 
the 
200-yard 

butterfly, junior Jared Daigle 

raced an event he hadn’t swam 

since he was 16. Michigan 

State’s Cristofer Gore pushed 

for victory, coming close to 

overtaking Daigle at the third 

turn 
but 
falling 
behind 
in 

one of Michigan State’s best 

performances of the night. 

Daigle also swam on the 

second-place team in the 400-

yard medley relay. The team that 

won that race included junior 

Will Chan and freshman James 

LeBuke, two swimmers who 

made a significant impact in the 

meet.

Winning the 50-yard freestyle 

and contributing to a victory 

in the 200-yard freestyle relay, 

LeBuke gave a sneak peak 

of Michigan’s future as the 

swimmer flexed his adjustment 

to American swimming.

“(LeBuke) is just getting his 

feet under him right now and 

learning,” Bottom said. “He’s not 

a yard swimmer. From Canada, 

he’s 
a 
meter 
swimmer. 
It’s 

important for him to learn how to 

swim in the short pool and enjoy 

his time here.”

While LeBuke gave Michigan 

a first glimpse at what he could 

do, Chan seemed to be one of 

the Wolverines’ best swimmers 

overall with a victory in the 200-

yard breaststroke.

“(Chan) has already made such 

a huge impact in his freshman 

and sophomore years,” Daigle 

said. “I think this year a lot of 

our breaststrokers … are going to 

have a huge breakout season.”

Michigan sophomore Danny 

Berlitz made the NCAA “B” 

cut in the 400-yard individual 

medley, meaning he can enter 

the 
NCAA 
Championship 

once all “A” cuts are in. Other 

swimmers came within striking 

distance of the cuts in their 

own races, including freshman 

Wyatt Davis and LeBuke.

The Wolverines may have 

vanquished the Spartans in the 

arena, but like the gladiators 

Bottom referenced, that did not 

affect their respect for their 

foes.

“I know all these last meets, 

everything they go to — their 

last home meet, their last away 

meet, their last time in the 

University of Michigan pool — 

it’s special for them,” Daigle 

said. “And it’s special for all the 

teams that came before them.”

Members of the Michigan 

team threw their full support 

behind their visiting rivals, 

chanting “Go green, go white” 

across the pool to close out the 

meet. The Spartans also brought 

masks emblazoned with “Save 

our Sport” for the Wolverines to 

wear.

“We 
told 
them 
to 
keep 

fighting at the end,” Daigle said. 

“We know they will.”

With its third meet under 

its belt, Michigan made key 

steps in its ability to hold leads. 

While the end to the in-state 

rivalry brings intense feelings of 

sorrow, the Wolverines seemed 

to leave it all in the pool for the 

Spartans.

The Michigan men’s basketball team had won seven of its last eight 
games prior to the shutdown by double figures.

STOLL


On Friday night, the Michigan 

hockey team was celebrating 
its win over Notre Dame and 
looking ahead to its next game. 
On Saturday night, the team 
suddenly had no idea when its 
next game might be. 

On Jan. 23, the University of 

Michigan announced all athletic 
activities would be paused for 
two weeks following confirmed 
cases of the COVID-19 B.1.1.7 
variant 
within 
the 
athletic 

department. The hockey team 
has had no positive cases since it 
began practicing in October. 

“I guess my initial reaction 

was a little bit of shock, a little 
bit of surprise, a little bit of 
disappointment, a little bit of 
anger.” Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson said. “But here we are 
and we’re looking to spin this 
into a positive.”

Pearson also understood and 

supported the administration’s 
decision and instead turned 
his focus to how he could help 
his team through the next two 
weeks. Following the news, 
the Wolverines held a couple of 
team meetings to discuss the 
next steps.

“The main point of the calls 

was just to reinforce the message 
from our athletic director in our 
department as to what this means 
and what our responsibilities are 
as 
student-athletes,” 
Pearson 

said. “And to make sure that they 
were all OK and (the coaches) are 
going to be a resource available 
to them.”

After the players got over 

the initial disappointment, a 
big concern they expressed 
was how they would be able to 
practice during the pause with 
the team required to quarantine 
and practices prohibited. They 
want to continue to train, but 

without being able to gather in 
large groups or use indoor ice 
rinks, that may be difficult. 

“They’ve got a regiment 

from 
our 
strength 
and 

conditioning coach,” Pearson 
said. “We’ll do a lot of zooms 

and stay in touch with them, 
give them different games to 
watch just to make sure that 
we’re keeping them mentally 
into the game; and then they 
have to do what they can 
physically to stay ready.”

Michigan had been playing 

some of its best hockey since 
it returned from winter break. 
The Wolverines won five of their 
past six games and are currently 
the seventh-ranked team in the 
country. 

Following the Notre Dame 

series, 
they 
were 
already 

scheduled to have a 12-day 
break before facing Penn State 
at home on Feb. 3 and 4. As of 
now, those are the only games 
to be postponed. Pearson also 
mentioned it would probably 
take the team 4-5 days to get 
back into game shape and they 
currently are scheduled to play 
Michigan State on Feb. 9 — just 
two days after the shutdown is 
supposed to end. 

“We’ve had past experience 

with this almost every year with 
the (Great Lakes Invitational) 
tournament,” 
Pearson 
said. 

“Normally we have a two and a 
half week break, we reconvene 

after Christmas, maybe have 
three and a half, four days of 
practice and then we play. And 
we’ve been able to manage that.

“Now the only difference 

here is are our kids going to have 
access to ice somewhere? And 
when you’re in a quarantine, 
that answer is no.”

The Wolverines are faced with 

a lot of uncertainty, but that was 
expected with a season being 
played amid an ongoing pandemic. 
When players returned to Ann 
Arbor, they didn’t know when 
their season would begin and 
what health and safety protocols 
they’d be under. The shutdown 
is just one more challenge they’ll 
have to overcome. 

“We’re 
all 
dealing 
with 

adversity in our lives,” Pearson 
said. “It’s how you handle that 
adversity. We’ve got to come 
up stronger on the other side 
whenever we’re allowed to come 
back.”

Cliff Keen grew up on a farm in 

Oklahoma. In college, he was an 
undefeated wrestler, a football player 
and a track athlete for Oklahoma 
A&M, which is now Oklahoma State. 

He came to Ann Arbor to attend 

the University of Michigan Law 
School, from which he earned his law 
degree in 1933. He then stayed in the 
community, working at a small law 
firm in Ann Arbor while coaching the 
wrestling team. Just a few years after 
he became the head varsity wrestling 
coach, he left his law job to focus on 
coaching full-time.

During his time as the wrestling 

coach, Keen was also part of the 
football coaching staff for 33 years 
and was an assistant coach under 
the helm of Michigan greats: Fritz 
Crisler, Fielding Yost and Bennie 
Oosterbaan. 

Keen was also the head coach of 

Michigan’s 150-pound football team 
during the 1947 and 1948 seasons 
— the only two seasons in which 
the team existed. He won national 
titles both years and brought the 
T-formation into Michigan football. 

As a wrestling coach, Keen had 

the longest tenure of any coach in 
University athletics history and holds 
the record for the longest career of 
any collegiate wrestling coach. He 
was the head coach at Michigan for 
42 years, spanning from 1925 to 1970, 
with a three-year break during World 
War II where he spent his time as a 
naval commander.

During his tenure as the head 

coach for Michigan, Keen led many 
teams to outstanding success. His 
accomplishments include 12 Big 
Ten 
Conference 
Championships, 

11 
individual 
NCAA 
champion 

wrestlers, 68 All-Americans and 81 
Big Ten Champions. 

In 1977, Keen was inducted into 

the National Wrestling Hall of 
Fame. A few years later in 1980, he 
was inducted into the University 
of Michigan Hall of Honor. In 1981, 
he was inducted into the State of 
Michigan Sports Hall of Fame.

Statistically speaking, Keen is 

one of the greatest coaches of all-
time at Michigan in any sport. But 
what makes him truly a legend is his 
value in building the character of his 
wrestlers and those around him by 
setting a positive example with his 
coaching style.

“You know he was quite a task 

master, but he had a unique style that 
he used to motivate people,” Rick 
Bay, a former Michigan wrestler and 
Keen’s assistant coach from 1970-
1974 and successor, said. “His way 
was really to always let you know that 
he thought you could do better, but 
at the end of the day, his philosophy 
was even if he had been getting on 
somebody during practice for one 
reason or another, at the end of each 
practice if that had been the case he 
would take that person aside and say 
something positive. He always felt 
like you should leave any coaching 
situation each day with something 
positive.

“He was inspirational in a way that 

was sort of quiet and philosophical 
… he wasn’t much into chewing 
anybody out, especially in front of the 
team,” Bay said. “He would say, ‘You 
know, it takes a long time to build up 
someone’s confidence, but a person 
with authority can tear it down 
pretty quickly,’ and so he coached in 
a positive way. You know there are 
coaches who coach negatively that 
works too for some but not for him.” 

Jesse Rawls Sr., an All-American 

wrestler for Keen during the last 
years of his coaching career, spoke 
about the impact that positive 
coaching and reassurance can have 
on an athlete through an experience 
he had with Keen. 

“He said to me one day, came up 

to me (after) I won the match. I did 
something, I don’t know what, I 
was losing, I ended up winning and 
I didn’t quit. I can remember sitting 
beside him, and he hit me on my 
knee and he said, ‘Boy you’re one hell 
of a guy, one hell of a wrestler.’ And 
that just did a lot for me as a person, 
because when a coach says you did 
a fine job and you know that, deep 
down inside, you tried to do a fine job. 
That really gave me a big plus sign. 

“I went on that year and won the 

Big Ten Championship without a 
doubt, and he was very proud of that.”

Keen believed in coaching the 

fundamentals and he often taught 
wrestlers by stepping on to the mat 
and giving demonstrations himself — 
even at the end of his career, when he 
was in his late 60s. Even at matches, 
Keen would sometimes demonstrate 
a move that he thought would be a 
good strategy.

“Even though at that moment 

he’d be in coat and tie and I would 
too because we were the coaches, we 
would take our team out and heck, 
he’d take off his suit coat if it popped 
into his mind, he’d get down on the 
mat (and say), ‘Rick jump on top of me 
I wanna show this,’ ” Bay said. “He 
was wearing a coat and tie and he was 
demonstrating on me for the sake of 
the wrestlers trying to make a point, 
and of course he’d mess up my shirt 
and he elbowed me in the ribs while 
he was demonstrating all this, but 
that was kind of the way he did it. It 
was sort of off the top of his head, but 
he had a lot of experience.”

Even after his retirement, Keen 

continued to influence Michigan 
wrestling. In his career as a 
wrestling coach, Bay incorporated 
many coaching techniques that he 
learned from Keen when he became 
Michigan’s next head coach.

“I used everything I learned from 

him,” Bay said. “I mean I talked about 
positive reinforcement, I was not a 
screamer, I did not swear at my team 
or individuals on the team, I always 
tried to treat everybody with respect. 
I tried to be more organized than I 
thought (Keen) was, but that was just 
my own personality.”

Rawls also incorporated many of 

the coaching techniques he learned 
from Keen when he coached at 
Harrisburg University after his 
playing days. 

“If you talk to any of my wrestlers, 

I would always say, ‘Son do this, son 
do that’ and I always prepared them 
for the next step,” Rawls said. “I said 
that ‘cause coach Keen used to always 
use these terms.” 

Keen’s coaching style also led to a 

close-knit team atmosphere that was 
commended by those who wrestled 
for him.

“We’re going out here, the A boys, 

and we’re gonna act like men and 
we’re gonna wrestle and we’re gonna 
be tough,” Rawls said.

Bradford Stone — my grandfather 

and a class of 1950 wrestler for Keen 
— had similarly positive memories 
from his time competing with the 
Wolverines. He especially enjoyed 
the camaraderie of the team. 

“That’s what separates wrestling 

from a lot of other team sports is that 
you have no one,” Stone said. “Look 
to your left, look to your right, there’s 
nobody there, (but) they would 

always root for you and so forth and 
you would root for them.” 

Jerry Hoddy, an All-American 

wrestler for Keen who wrestled 
during the last years of Keen’s 
coaching career, also spoke about 
how close the team was and how the 
team had each other’s backs even in 
difficult times. 

“One of his favorite sayings, 

particularly under duress when we 
were traveling, was when something 
would go wrong … (he) had his boys 
and if we got anywhere and there was 
some sort of snafu — and about 9 out 
of 10 times there was — Cliff would 
get into a dither and you’d hear this 
booming voice say well I got my boys 
here,” Hoddy said. “He was just an 
immense father figure for everybody 
that came through that program for 
years and years and years. Everybody 
cherishes that time and I think most 
people would say (they) unabashedly 
loved Cliff Keen dearly.” 

That team dynamic not only led 

Keen’s wrestlers to want to win for 
themselves, but also win for Keen and 
the University. 

“You wanted him to be proud of 

you,” Bay said. “That was always a 
dynamic that was pretty pervasive, 
so you wanted to win for yourself, but 
you (also) wanted to win for coach 
Keen.”

Keen was a man who was true 

to his word and who highly valued 
integrity, hard work and old school 
sportsmanship.

“I first met him in 1968, 

when he came to Lawrenson, 
Minnesota 
(where) 
we 
had 

the 
Junior 
College 
National 

Wrestling Championship,” Rawls 
said. “That’s when I met him 
and that’s when he offered me a 
scholarship at the University of 
Michigan. And his words to me — 
that I will never forget — was that 
he had never recruited a Black 
wrestler. 

“And he came to Minnesota 

to recruit the best wrestler in the 
tournament. And I happened to be 
the best wrestler in the tournament 
and happened to be Black. So, 
we recruited. And he said ‘If you 
come to Michigan, I’ll give you a 
full scholarship,’ and my whole life 
changed. That stuck with me and I 
will always remember that. And he 
was true to his word.” 

Stone also spoke about the values 

and integrity that Keen had.

In the Big Ten dual meet, 

Michigan’s Larry Nelson won his 
previous round, but not without 
cost. Nelson was injured and with it, 
Michigan’s chances of a championship 
lowered. Stone, who was standing 
nearby, 
suggested 
Nelson 
make 

an appearance despite his injury 
— the appearance would help the 
Wolverines’ chances of making the 
conference championships. However, 
Keen refused.

“And he said, ‘I would not take 

a chance on injuring a young boy.’ 

Sports didn’t matter as much as the 
health of his boys, in other words.”

Keen also believed strongly that 

being a student came before being 
an athlete. Hoddy spoke about the 
importance of academics to Keen.

“He took great pride in his rate of 

graduation, of the people that went 
through the wrestling program 
there at the University of Michigan.” 
Hoddy said. “He was always talking 
about (how it’s) not so much what you 
do while you’re here in Ann Arbor, it’s 
what you do after you leave.”

Keen also believed that lessons 

learned on the mat could be used in 
the athletes’ lives outside of sports as 
well.

“There was one time when there 

was a guy named Byron Dean in my 
weight class and we would wrestle 
off to see who gets to represent 
Michigan and who was going to go 
down and wrestle Illinois,” Stone 
said. “I actually won the match 
internally. And I really wanted to get 
this, now he would beat me 6-3 or 
8-4, so that night I couldn’t sleep half 
the night and I was so charged up, 
went out there and I beat him 5-0. 
And I found out that if I just put forth 
regular effort, I’m sort of average, 
average at a high level of course, 
not off the street, but if I really 
wanted something and really put my 
effort into it without reservations, 
how much better I could be. And I 
carried that over the years. I learned 
that from Keen while wrestling. 
Multitudes of us were made better 
people for having wrestled under 
Keen.” 

Keen cared about his athletes 

very much and still had strong 
connections with his wrestlers 
after they graduated

In 
1975, 
Rawls 
needed 

somewhere to train for the 1976 
Olympics. Where else but with an 
elite program at Michigan? There 
was just one problem: He had 
nowhere to live, but Keen looked 
after his wrestlers.

“He said, ‘Let me see what I 

can do for you.’ I got there Labor 
Day, which was September 1975,” 
Rawls recalls. “I called him, and 
that … Tuesday or Wednesday I 
had an interview, and Friday I was 
moving into housing. Just that 

fast. That’s how much pull that he 
had.”

At his retirement party after 42 

years of coaching, wrestlers decades 
apart in age came together to share 
their well wishes.

“And all his former wrestlers that 

were still living all came back to pay 
him homage upon his retirement.” 
Stone said. “It was an evening just full 
of love and full of respect and that was 
a remarkable evening.”

“He was an immense father figure 

for everybody that came through 
that program for years and years 
and years.” Hoddy said “Everybody 
cherishes that time and I think most 
people would say, unabashedly, 
they loved Cliff Keen dearly and 
everything that he did to represent 
the University of Michigan was a 
proper thing.”

Keen’s legacy lives on through 

the University and the sport of 
wrestling. The wrestling supply 
company he founded in 1958, Cliff 
Keen Athletic, is one of the premiere 
companies in the business and 
wrestlers across the country use 
the signature Cliff Keen headgear 
designed by the coach.

Keen positively impacted many 

people’s lives during his coaching 
career and his legacy will live on. 

“You gotta say he is one of the 

great Michigan coaches of all time 
in any sport,” Bay said. “He was 
a unique individual. Nothing one 
dimensional about him. He was 
dignified. He was a gentleman 
coach. He coached the way I always 
felt you should coach. I think the 
principles he stood for are still 
important today.”

Even now, Keen commands a 

high degree of respect in wrestlers 
of all ages, including those too 
young to remember his time at 
Michigan. 

“Last year at a shopping mall in 

Livonia, we saw a teenager wearing 
a Cliff Keen Wrestling Club shirt.” 
Stone said. “We asked him about 
it. He was a high-school wrestler. I 
told him that I had wrestled for Cliff 
Keen. He said, with an expression 
of awe, you wrestled for Cliff Keen? 

“I realized, (as) if I didn’t already 

know, that his influence spanned 
generations.”

Michigan coach Mel Pearson reflects on what pause means for season


In the wake of the Michigan 

Department of Health and Human 
Services’ directive to shut down 
all Michigan athletic department 
activities late Saturday night due 
to detection of the B.1.1.7 COVID-
19 strain, Christian Hubaker began 
reaching out to fellow student-
athletes. Hubaker, a senior on the 
track and field and cross-country 
teams, felt especially aggrieved 
by the decision, as it prevents the 
Wolverines from competing in 

this week’s Big Ten Cross Country 
Championships. In turn, that will 
leave Michigan athletes ineligible 
for NCAA Championships.

The 
source 
of 
Hubaker’s 

frustration, though, was a sense 
that the MDHHS directive was 
poorly aimed.

“It’s foolish to think that the 

variant isn’t gonna be around in 
two weeks and it’s probably gonna 
be a bigger deal,” Hubaker told 
The Daily. “Because we’re the only 
sector of the community that’s 
being shut down right now. And 
we’re, in my opinion, the safest 
and have the strictest guidelines 
of anyone else in the community. 

“So if we had it, the community 

definitely has it. And we’re 
worried, a lot of us are worried … 
and we’ve heard this two-week 
period thrown around a lot before 
and we’re worried that this isn’t 
gonna be a two-week thing.”

As soon as Hubaker began 

reaching out to athletes from other 
programs, he realized he wasn’t 

alone. Hubaker said he and Joe 
Pace, a sixth-year utility player 
on the baseball team, were the 
leaders in crafting the statement 
and petition that were eventually 
posted to social media Monday 
afternoon. The letter, though, 
was signed off by a “coalition of 
student-athletes,” which Hubaker 
said 
includes 
athletes 
from 

nearly every program on campus, 
including the men’s basketball and 
football programs.

“We’ve been trying to have 

it be a big, collaborative effort 
because we really want to have a 
unified voice out there between 

all athletes,” Hubaker said. As of 
late Monday afternoon, that goal 
had succeeded, with the petition 
receiving over 2,880 signatures in 
just six hours. Pace said that over 
100 athletes were in a GroupMe to 
help collaborate on the petition.

Additionally, Pace said that 

athletic director Warde Manuel 
and the rest of the administration 
“support us voicing our opinion 
and standing up for what we 
believe in.”

The athletes in charge of 

creating the petition stopped 
short of involving coaches, who 
Hubaker acknowledged are in 
a “tricky spot” as the bridge 
between athletes and the athletic 
department. 
Hockey 
coach 

Mel Pearson said on Monday 
that his “initial reaction (to the 
shutdown) was a little bit of 
shock, a little bit of surprise, a 
little bit of disappointment, a 
little bit of anger. Our players 
have done a great job. We’ve been 
negative since early July.” 

That’s a sense shared by teams 

who have been affected by the 
shutdown.

“We heard about the new 

strain and they gave us all the 
information,” Pace told The 
Daily. “And the initial thought 
process is, OK, (most teams) 
on the campus have no COVID 
cases, how does this make any 
sense?”

As of Saturday night, there 

were no positive tests on the 
men’s 
basketball, 
women’s 

basketball 
or 
hockey 
teams. 

Hubaker, meanwhile, said that 
the 
cross-country 
program 

has had one positive case since 
returning to campus in the fall. 
The case occurred approximately 
two weeks ago and was not the 
B.1.1.7 strain. The athlete who 
tested positive was quarantined 
and no other members of the 
team tested positive.

Also as of Saturday night, 

there were five known cases and 
15 presumed positive cases of 
the B.1.1.7. strain in the athletic 
department. 
Michigan 
chief 

medical 
executive 
Joneigh 

Khaldun said in a Monday press 
conference that there were 13 
known cases of the variant in 
Washtenaw County.

Because cases of the B.1.1.7 

variant have been limited to a 
handful of programs, athletes and 
coaches alike have struggled to 
come to grips with the shutdown 
being enacted throughout the 
athletic department.

“The 
consistency 
of 
the 

mandate to have a quarantine 
when we’ve all been testing 

daily and the team was testing 
negative, people feel like it hasn’t 
been a consistent application 
when it’s only Michigan athletics 
that’s chosen to kind of be in this 
position,” volleyball coach Mark 
Rosen told The Daily. Currently, 
he said, his program does not 
have any cases of COVID-19. “So 
I think there’s frustration and 
disappointment in our coaches 
right now.”

Paul Juda, a sophomore on the 

men’s gymnastics team, shares 
Rosen’s frustration. Juda was 
among a group of Wolverines’ 
gymnasts in Lincoln for a 
meet with Nebraska that was 
scheduled for Sunday when he 
found out about the shutdown. 
Due to the requirement that 
athletes 
enter 
a 
two-week 

quarantine as soon as possible, 
he and his teammates had to 
abandon plans to return to 
Michigan on commercial flights, 
instead taking an 11-hour bus 
ride back to campus.

“Not something our team 

was very happy about knowing 
our team is completely COVID 
free so that wasn’t fun at all,” 
Juda told The Daily, adding that 
neither the men’s nor women’s 
gymnastics teams have had any 
positive COVID-19 tests of any 
variant in the past two weeks.

“Given the fact that it is not 

only up to 50% more contagious, 
and the fact that it’s already here 
… I don’t see (the shutdown) not 
being extended past two weeks,” 
Juda said.

In light of that concern, the 

primary goal for the coalition 
of student-athletes is now for 
the two-week mandate to be 
revisited.

“We think that on a team-by-

team basis, if there are teams 
that have had no contact with the 
variant strand, if there are teams 
that have all healthy people 
right now, then they should 
be allowed to resume athletic 
activity immediately,” Hubaker 
said. “If that doesn’t happen, 
we’re mostly looking to get more 
transparency from the health 
department to athletes. Because 
as these things continue to be 
ruled out, these requirements of 
us, and as they have been all year, 
we haven’t had a good line of 
communication with the health 
department.”

Michigan defense needs 

improvement after first loss

Defense wins championships.
It’s an old adage that the 

Michigan women’s basketball 
team (10-1 overall, 5-1 Big Ten) 
struggled to adhere to in its loss 
to Ohio State on Thursday. It was 
a game that exposed one of the 
Wolverines’ biggest weaknesses 
— defense.

This season, Michigan has 

prided itself on holding teams 
to low scoring, a product of 
controlling defense. Typically 
switching from man to zone 
looks effortless, and scrappy 
defenders like fifth-year senior 
guard Akienreh Johnson and 
sophomore guard Maddie Nolan 
make opposing teams’ offense 
look sloppy.

But in the Wolverines’ closest 

win against Nebraska, winning 
by only two points, and their 
first loss of the season against 
the Buckeyes, defense was the 
difference.

As the number one team 

in the Big Ten conference in 
both offensive and defensive 
rebounds, 
Michigan 
doesn’t 

allow 
many 
second-chance 

points. But against Ohio State, 
it allowed 14. For reference, 
in 
their 
first 
match-up 

with Wisconsin (where the 
Wolverines beat the Badgers 
by 43 points) they allowed only 
three second-chance points, 
dominating the boards by a 
large margin.

Most 
of 
these 
second-

chance points occurred early 
in the first half, but kept the 
Buckeyes in the game as they 
grew a lead they wouldn’t 
relinquish. Even in a game 
where junior forward Naz 
Hillmon 
scored 
a 
school-

record 50 points, Michigan 

couldn’t 
overcome 
their 

defensive struggles to win.

“Our defense, I mean first-

half defense, was not our best,” 
said Hillmon after the Ohio 
State game on Jan. 21. “So there’s 
definitely something that we 
want to work on. We really try 
to pride ourselves on being great 
on the defensive in transitioning 
into offense, and in the first half, 
we didn’t really do that.”

Fast-break points are another 

area the Wolverines need to 
contain. These points happen in 
transition defense, something 
Michigan 
struggles 
with 
at 

times. 
Against 
Ohio 
State, 

the Wolverines allowed nine 
fast-break points, and against 
Nebraska, they allowed four. 
While nine and four may seem 
like small numbers, in two games 
where the score was within four 
points, those nine points made all 
the difference.

“They are also a team that … 

scores well in transition and I 
thought that’s how they got their 
run early on was on transition 
and off of our turnovers,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico after the Ohio State game. 
“We’ve got to get better at the 
transition (defense), especially 
against them.”

The continued loss of junior 

wing Leigha Brown due to 
COVID-19 protocol has also 
posed its challenges on the 
defensive 
end. 
Brown’s 
an 

aggressive defender that adds 
another layer of depth to the 
defensive end. Her lanky frame 
closes passing lanes and helps 
Hillmon down low with double 
teams and rebounding.

As conference play becomes 

increasingly 
competitive, 
the 

Wolverines can’t just rely on their 
offensive production but will 
need a cohesive defense to propel 
them to victory.

How Michigan’s student-athlete coalition formed in the wake of 

athletic department shutdown

‘How does this make any sense?’

THEO MACKIE
Daily Sports Writer

MADELINE HINKLEY/Daily

After a weekend of uncertainty, a group of athletes took to social media on Monday to express their frustration over 
the athletic department’s pause. 

JULIA SCHACHINGER/Daily

Against Ohio State, Michigan gave up the most points it had all season.

If shutdown derails the season, let’s take a moment to appreciate it

It’s around 10 a.m. on Sunday, 

and Katelynn Flaherty is call-
ing. We’d set this up on Saturday 
afternoon, before the news of a 
department-wide shutdown for 
Michigan athletics hit. I wanted to 
ask Flaherty, the 
leading all-time 
scorer for Michi-
gan 
basket-

ball (men’s and 
women’s), about 
this year’s team, 
which 
looks 

like it might do 
something spe-
cial. 
My 
plan 

was to talk to her, to get on the 
postgame Zoom call after Mich-
igan-Purdue in the afternoon 
and to write a column about the 
arc of the program’s growth.

Then news got in the way. 
The women’s basketball team — 

along with every other Michigan 
athletic program — is in quaran-
tine until Feb. 7. This quarantine 
means no games and no practices, 
so it is unlikely that they can return 
to play immediately after it ends. 
Right now, there are six games 
left on the Wolverines’ schedule, 
with the status of eight postponed 
games unclear. Exactly if or how 
those games get made up, or what 
it means for the Big Ten standings 
if they can’t be played, is unclear (a 
Big Ten spokesman didn’t return a 
text asking how standings would be 
decided if games can’t be made up).

It’s worth noting as well that this 

is the best-case scenario. As of Sat-
urday night, there were no COVID-
19 cases in the women’s basketball 
program (or men’s basketball or 

hockey, for that matter). As per-
tains to everything else regarding 
the pandemic, that could change. 

The University, and the Michi-

gan Department of Health and 
Human Services, aren’t playing 
around with the B.1.1.7. variant 
of the virus. It’s thought to be up 
to 50% more transmissible and, 
according to Matt Hancock, the 
health secretary in the United 
Kingdom, 10-50% more deadly. If 
this two-week shutdown doesn’t 
halt the spread of the variant, 
it’s unclear what happens next.

But even this best-case scenario 

is a shame, for the reasons Flaherty 
was calling me for in the first place. 
The Michigan women’s basketball 
team is 10-1, their first loss coming 
this week after a record 50-point 
performance from junior forward 

Naz Hillmon wasn’t enough to get 
past Ohio State. They look like a 
team that could get to the second 
weekend of the NCAA Tournament 
— which would make them the best 
team in the history of the program.

“I do think that when we are 

100%, we can compete with any-
one,” Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico said after a win over Wis-
consin took them to 10-0. “I think 
our team really believes that.”

“That’s what coach (Barnes) 

Arico has talked about when she 
was recruiting me initially and 
then from the time that I was 
there,” Flaherty said. “Just to 
see it all happen, it’s incredible.”

To put that into context, when 

Flaherty came into the program 
as a freshman in 2014, Michigan 
had made the NCAA Tournament 

four times in program history. 
The Wolverines finished eighth in 
the Big Ten that year, and they’ve 
steadily climbed upwards since. 
In Flaherty’s junior year, they won 
the WNIT after an unexpected 
snub from the selection commit-
tee. “But I think after that, it kind 
of was the expectation. ‘OK, make 
the NCAA Tournament,’ ” she said.

The next two years, they did. 

Before COVID-19 canceled last 
year’s tournament, they were 
expected to make it again. And 
it seemed like — barring another 
act of God — they’d be in a posi-
tion to do so again this year.

Problem is, no one accounted 

for an act — or to use their phras-
ing, a recommendation — of 
the 
Michigan 
Department 
of 

Health 
and 
Human 
Services.

“No. Not at all,” Flaherty said 

when asked whether she could 
imagine being in this situation. 
“Just because I’m someone that 
wanted to be out there individu-
ally, working out all the time. 
That’s something that I did every 
single day when I was at Michigan. 

“But also the team aspect. Being 

able to run, just communicate, talk 
about everything, it’s definitely dif-
ferent if everyone has to quarantine. 
And then like you said, not being on 
the floor, just staying in shape and 
having that connection with your 
team. That’s really what’s going so 
well for Michigan right now, just 
how they’re playing together out 
there. I think that’s hard and it’s 
just hard not doing that for two 
weeks and then (coming) back and 
(being) expected to go out there 
and pick up where you left off. 

“I don’t think that’s fair to 

put that expectation on these 
athletes just because it’s very, 
very 
different 
if 
you’re 
not 

doing anything for two weeks.”

The program declined to 

make Barnes Arico and players 
available for questions on Sun-
day morning, which is under-
standable given they’re still 
processing the news. Suffice it 
to say, though, they have every 
right to be upset even if they 
believe the decision to be cor-
rect. So does every other ath-
lete, coach and administrator 
at the University who’s been 
trying since October to pull 
off games and practices safely.

This might have been the 

year the Michigan women’s 
basketball program took the 

next step. It still could be. 
But 
the 
questions 
hanging 

over it now are much bigger 
than just a couple of days ago.

This team may no longer be 

defined by Hillmon setting pro-
gram records, winning the Big 
Ten or an NCAA Tournament 
run. If that’s the case, it’ll be 
hard to swallow. Getting the pro-
gram to this point hasn’t been 
easy. Having it ripped away for 
reasons beyond the team’s con-
trol would border on tragic.

So, to make sure someone 

gives Barnes Arico and the pro-
gram 
that 
credit, 
we’ll 
give 

the last word here to Flaherty.

“She wanted to build up the 

program, she wanted to compete 
with the UConn’s, the Kentucky’s, 
whoever was at the top at that 
time,” Flaherty said. “And she 
wanted to pick people to come to 
Michigan that believed in that 
vision and wanted to be different 
than going to those high-caliber 
schools. To kind of be the start of 
something special, make a name 
for yourself. So I think that just 
attests to who coach (Barnes) 
Arico is, how far the program 
has come, but also all of the girls 
that have been recruited, every-
one there, just for a bigger mis-
sion. Everyone’s working together. 

“So 
I 
think 
that’s 
really 

important to note. She told me 
that however many years ago 
and here it is coming to frui-
tion a few short years later.”

Michigan releases a statement that the first case 
of the COVID-19 B.1.1.7 variant in the state was a 
member of the University of Michigan community 
and that two more members of the community 
with ties to that person were confirmed cases of 
the new strain. In total, seven cases were linked 
to the first positive test, though five were not yet 
certain to be the B.1.1.7 variant.
“Women’s gymnastics is the most fun I’ve had shooting a 
sporting event. Despite limited fans the chemistry between the 
teammates was electric. Knowing that this is the last sport I may 
be shooting for a while makes it so much more meaningful.”

Shooting the Notre Dame hockey game was one of the most 
unique experiences I’ve had as a member of the Daily’s pho-
tostaff. Between driving three hours away from Ann Arbor in 
the middle of the first week of school and navigating my way 
through an unfamiliar campus, it was certainly an adventure. 
I’m glad to have had this opportunity during my last semester in 
Ann Arbor, and I hope I get another chance to feel the cool air of 
the ice rink before I leave.

A sense of finality already surrounded last weekend’s swim and 
dive meet against Michigan State – It marked the last time that 
the two teams would ever face off due to the ending of Michigan 
State’s program, and the respect for this was plainly clear across 
the entire team and coaching staff. This energy made for a special 
meet to see, especially before a short-term break from the pool.
