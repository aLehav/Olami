The Washtenaw Health 
Initiative 
Opioid 
Project 
hosted 
the 
Washtenaw 
County Opioid Summit on 
Tuesday, 
where 
various 
state and local stakeholders 
came 
together 
for 
the 
discussion focused on the 
county’s high, but declining, 
rate of opioid overdoses and 
the link between trauma 
and addiction. Participants 
learned 
about 
opioid 
use in the county, heard 
testimonials and attended 
breakout sessions relating 
to 
primary 
prevention, 
pain 
management, 
harm 
reduction, treatment and 
recovery.
U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, 
D-Mich., 
shared 
a 
few 
words 
on 
her 
personal 

relationship 
to 
opioid 
addiction, 
discussing 
how her father suffered 
from 
prescription 
drug 
addiction, and her younger 
sister died from a drug 
overdose. Dingell stressed 
opioid 
addiction 
affects 
many people and said it is 
necessary to reduce the 
stigma associated with the 
illness.
“This is really real to me. 
It’s not easy for me to talk 
about. I talk about it more 
than I did, because you 
look at me and think I’ve 
got this great life,” Dingell 
said. “And I am lucky, I’ve 
got a lot of friends, I’ve got 
a lot of family, they keep me 
going. But I do talk about 
it, because it happens in 
every family, it happens 
in 
every 
community, 
every neighborhood, and 
you cannot imagine the 
desperation.”

As 
the 
warm 
weather 
continues, areas of Michigan 
are increasingly at risk for 
Eastern Equine Encephalitis 
(EEE) virus, according to the 
Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention. This rare brain 
infection is spread through 
mosquitoes and approximately 
one third of people infected die 

from the disease. There is no 
cure or vaccine for the virus.
Nine 
people 
have 
been 
infected in Michigan, including 
three fatalities. Thirty-three 
animal cases of EEE have also 
been confirmed in 15 Michigan 
counties, 
including 
Allegan, 
Barry, Berrien, Calhoun, Cass, 
Genesee, Jackson, Kalamazoo, 
Kent, 
Lapeer, 
Livingston, 
Montcalm, Newaygo, St. Joseph 
and Van Buren. 
Katherine 
Spindler, 

professor of microbiology and 
immunology at the University 
of Michigan, explained that 
though EEE is not a particularly 
new virus, it has been more 
prominent this year.
“Is this going to become an 
epidemic?” Spindler questioned. 
“I suspect that’s not the case … 
We’re approaching winter, and 
a hard frost is going to kill off 
many, if not all, mosquitoes that 
are fostering this virus.”
LSA sophomore Nicole Lin 

of Grand Rapids, a recently 
affected area in Kent County, 
said in light of the virus, she 
has growing concerns for her 
family and friends. 
“It’s been pretty scary hearing 
about it,” Lin said. “I have a lot 
of friends and family there, and 
my mom is worried. I’ve talked 
to my friends to make sure 
they’re staying safe, especially 
since a lot of them get out late 
from work and school.”

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Author of the New York 
Times best-selling trilogy 
“Divergent” 
Veronica 
Roth spoke at the Ann 
Arbor Public Library about 
her 
new 
book 
Tuesday 
night. Residential College 
lecturer 
and 
author 

Alexander Weinstein led 
the conversation in front 
of a crowd of nearly 200 
people. 
Roth’s new book, “The 
End and Other Beginnings,” 
published Tuesday, is a 
collection 
of 
dystopian 
short stories. In addition 
to the “Divergent” trilogy, 
Roth 
has 
written 
other 
dystopian novels including 

“Carve the Mark” and “The 
Fate Divides.”
The night began with a 
reading of a selection from 
Roth’s book and Weinstein’s 
new 
book, 
“Universal 
Love.” They then opened up 
a conversation surrounding 
the topics of writing and 
dystopian novels. 
Roth and Weinstein both 
said growing up in the 

Midwest had a significant 
impact on their writing. 
“I feel like when I try to 
write about other places, I 
don’t feel like I know those 
places,” Roth said. “I’m 
always a visitor in those 
places. I’ve lived in the 
Chicago area since I was six 
years old and this is home.”

The City of Ann Arbor Planning 
Commission convened Tuesday 
night to discuss several zoning 
projects for the city. 
The first proposal brought to 
the table was the Hideaway Lane 
Planned Project, which asks the 
commission members to amend a 
previous site plan. Originally, the 
plan was to build an additional 
17 single-family homes, but the 
designers of the complex want 
to convert them to two-family 
homes in order to make them more 
affordable for first-time owners. 
This would increase the number 
of homes on this site from 29 to 45. 
Community 
member 
Mike 
Gustafson asked the commission 
to reject the proposal. He cited 
safety hazards regarding narrow 
streets, traffic and a lack of 
sufficient room for fire trucks in 
the case of an emergency. 
“As members of the community, 
as citizens of Ann Arbor, as your 
constituents, we urge you to reject 
this petition,” Gustafson said. 
“Traffic per day is substantial 
given the very tight quarters 
there… Many of us are concerned 
about fire engines getting in there 
in the event of an emergency. We 
feel that, given those dimensions, 
this could be very irresponsible 
and very dangerous.”

Government officials, community

State Rep. Steven Johnson, 
R-Wayland, introduced a bill last 
week that would allow the sale of 
20mg or less of flavored nicotine 
in the state, undercutting the 
ban Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 
placed on flavored e-cigarettes 
in early September. 
Whitmer 
declared 
the 
ban after Joneigh Khaldun, 
Michigan’s 
chief 
medical 
executive 
and 
chief 
deputy 
director 
for 
health 
at 
the 
Michigan 
Department 
of 
Health and Human Services, 
determined youth vaping was a 
public health emergency.
However, critics of the ban 
believe this will only push 
children and those who are 
trying to quit smoking to start 
smoking cigarettes again. In 
an interview with The Daily, 
Johnson said he agrees this is 
a problem for young people, but 
explained that he does not think 
this ban properly addresses the 
issue. 
“The governor identified a 
legitimate problem that there 
is a youth vaping problem,” 
Johnson said. “Now as far as 
how do we address that, I don’t 
believe that her unilateral ban 
on flavored vapes is the right 
solution.”

With 
National 
Coming 
Out Day just over a week 
away, 
the 
Ross 
School 
of 
Business’s 
LGBTQ 
organization, 
Out 
for 
Business, hosted OUTx on 
Tuesday evening as part of 
Ross Coming Out Week. OFB 
sponsors Ross Coming Out 
Week annually, featuring 
events 
highlighting 
and 
supporting 
the 
LGBTQ 
community 
within 
the 
Business School. Michigan 
Business Women and the 
MBA Council cosponsored 
the TEDx-style event.
Business 
graduate 
students 
James 
Lee 
and Laura Malecky, the 
co-presidents 
of 
OFB, 
began 
the 
event 
with 
introductions. 
Malecky 

said she wanted the event 
to bring together LGBTQ 
individuals and allies to 
normalize 
conversations 
about coming out and help 
promote LGBTQ culture.
“The goal of today’s event 
was for people to share their 
stories to help others better 
understand 
beyond 
the 
label of LGBTQ, and to help 
build solidarity and build 
inclusive 
communities,” 
Malecky 
said. 
“And 
obviously this is the first 
step.”
The 
keynote 
speaker, 
Nathan Manske, discussed 
I’m From Driftwood, the 
non-profit he founded based 
on his experiences growing 
up as a queer individual in a 
small Texas town. 
I’m From Driftwood, now 
in its 10th year, is an online 
archive of stories from the 

LGBTQ community and its 
allies. The website features 
both 
written 
accounts 
and video stories, some of 
which Manske highlighted 
during the event. Manske 
attributed the name of his 
non-profit to Harvey Milk’s 
sign featured in the 1978 San 
Francisco Gay Pride Parade. 
Manske said he wants I’m 
From Driftwood to serve 
as a reminder to LGBTQ 
individuals 
everywhere 
they are not alone.
“One 
remarkable 
characteristic 
of 
spoken 
stories is that they actually 
synchronize the brains of 
the speaker and listener,” 
Manske said. 
Manske also spoke about 
I’m From Driftwood’s 50 
State Story tour, during 
which he traveled to all 50 
states to collect stories from 
LGBTQ people. Manske 
believes the importance 
of I’m From Driftwood 
lies in the essence of 
the shared community 
that’s created through 
the telling and sharing 
of stories. 
Following 
Manske’s 
presentation, 
three 
speakers 
took 
the 
stage 
to 
share 
their 
coming 
out 
stories. 
Each 
story 
received 
a 
standing 
ovation 
from the audience of 
around 
150 
students, 
faculty 
members 
and 
local 
community 
members. These stories 
highlighted the diverse 
experiences of coming 
out as LGBTQ as well 
as the importance of 
having a network of 
support both during and 
after the coming out 
process.
Business 
graduate 
student Georgia Cassady 
told The Daily after the 
event that she came to 
OUTx as an ally of the 

LGBTQ 
community 
and 
hoped to better understand 
some 
of 
the 
challenges 
LGBTQ 
individuals 
face 
when they decide to come 
out. 
“(It was great) to hear 
about the different ways 
that people came to terms 
with who they are, how 
they figured it out and 
then the different tactics 
and strategies they had for 
actually deciding it was 
time to come out and who to 
come out to,” Cassady said.
Much of the discussion 
during the panel focused on 
the importance of breaking 
down labels in order to make 
the Michigan community 
and society at large more 
inclusive. Steven Feder, vice 
president of events for OFB, 
also 
pointed 
to 
LGBTQ 
resources on the University 
of Michigan’s campus, such 
as the Spectrum Center, 
which seeks to promote a 
diverse, collaborative space 
on campus. 
Feder told The Daily he 
wanted Ross Coming Out 
Week to include more events, 
such as conversation-based 
events like OUTx. Feder 
added that events focusing 
on sharing stories are a 
better way to bring together 
the LGBTQ community and 
its allies, especially within 
the business world.
“I think that the people 
in this room will be future 
CEOs, CFOs, CMOs, heads 
of non-profits,” Feder said. 
“And for them to have a 
better 
understanding 
of 
the emotional intensities 
(of coming out) and what 
you deal with as a member 
of the LGBT community, I 
think that will make them 
better leaders.”

Gay rights advocates question ROTC ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ 

October 1, 1993
Big changes could be in store for 
campus attitudes and policies this 
fall, in ROTC as well as
gay activist circles, as students 
face the first academic year under 
President Clinton’s “don’t
ask, don’t tell” military policy.
As a branch of the U.S. military, 
ROTC, which is responsible for 
recruiting more than 70 percent
of today’s military personnel, is 
subjected to the new rule affecting 
the armed forces. Under the new 
policy, students are no longer 
required to sign a form stating they 
are heterosexual in order to join 
ROTC. However, as in the military, 
the ban against homosexual activity 
is still in effect, and “if someone 

is engaged in direct homosexual 
type of activity, that actually could 
result in their being removed from 
the service,” said Robert Shepherd, 
the public affairs officer for the U.S. 
Army ROTC Cadet Command.
Clinton’s policy - a compromise 
of his original campaign promise 
- is affecting ROTCs on college 
campuses nationwide for the first 
time, and gay rights groups are 
not satisfied. The American Civil 
Liberties Union (ACLU) is unhappy 
with the policy’s implications for 
ROTC, and it is prepared to fight.
National ACLU spokesperson 
Alexander Robinson contends that 
ROTC should be removed from 
campuses because it violates many 
universities’ 
non-discrimination 

policies. The nationalACLU is 
currently involved in a legal battle 
supporting 
several 
plaintiffs 
against the “don’t ask, don’t tell” 
policy, citing the equal protection 
provision, First Amendment and 
right to free association under the 
Constitution.
The question of discrimination 
in ROTC is not a new one. A 
national 
debate 
escalated 
on 
campuses about five years ago, 
when 
student 
demonstrators 
called for the ban of ROTC based 
on discrimination against gays 
and lesbians. Several institutions, 
including 
Harvard 
University, 
Colby 
College 
and 
Rutgers 
University, abandoned their ROTC 
programs altogether. Bonnie Nix, 

president of the University ACLU, 
is hesitant about calling for any 
drastic action.
“I really think that at this point 
we need some kind of small, slow, 
incremental-type change,” she said.
Local gay rights activists plan 
to focus on changing policies 
within the ROTC system, rather 
than banning the program. But 
neither the University Lesbian Gay 
Male Bisexual Program nor the 
University ACLU have immediate 
plans to challenge the policy.
Nix said she is opposed to 
Clinton’s policy, and said University 
policy that forbids discrimiation 
on the basis of sexual orientation 
“brings into question a lot of what 
ROTC is doing.”

University regent’s Bylaw 14.06 
-- a non-discrimination policy -- 
was amended at last Friday’s Board 
of Regents meeting to prohibit 
discrimination based on sexual 
orientation.
LSA senior Chad Beyer, an active 
member of Queer Action, said he 
is against ROTC’s presence on 
campus because “gays and lesbians 
share this community with them 
and they have an explicit rule that 
the discriminate against us.”
“I really think that if the 
University wants to prove that it is 
committed to fostering diversity, 
that it really has to hold the 
ROTC accountable to the same 
standards… that gays and lesbians 
are not discriminated against on 

this campus.
David 
Schwartz, 
a 
campus 
ACLU officer, asked, “Is the ‘don’t 
ask, don’t tell’ policy a policy against 
discrimination on the basis of 
sexual orientation? I think it is. But 
I don’t know what the University is 
going to be able to do about it.”
But University ROTC students 
said they are satisfied with the 
policy.
“If it doesn’t compromise what 
we’re trying to do here in the ROTC 
program, then I’m all for it. If (gay 
recruits) do what they’re supposed 
to do and do it right, and do it with 
honor and they work hard, I have 
no problem wuth it at all,” said a 
Navy ROTC member, who spoke on 
the condition of anonymity.

After 
a 
discussion 
about 
potential water erosion from the 
creek nearby, traffic analysis, 
concerns 
about 
mushy 
land 
and fire safety hazards, the 
commission amended two aspects 
of the motion by changing the 
bike parking location and adding 
traffic 
calming 
mechanisms, 
and then approved the motion to 
council.
The commission then moved 
on to discuss two new companion 
projects: 
a 
multi-family 
residential six-story building next 
to the Michigan Theatre and a 
19-story high rise next door on 
East Washington that will feature 
240 residential units. 
Ann Arbor resident Ethel Potts 
attended the meeting and spoke 
out against the projects due to 
the fact they won’t have parking. 
Potts said she already struggles 
to find parking in the State Street 
area, and adding large housing 
complexes will only make it more 
difficult. 
“We have before us all the 
State Street character overlay 
zoning district with a 6-story 
building and no parking,” Potts 
said. “Major problems will result 
since the adjacent public parking 
structure is full with very limited 
hours open to the public. I try to 
use it regularly and can’t.”
However, seven community 
members spoke in favor of the 
State 
Street 
building. 
Doug 
Kelbaugh, 
professor 
at 
the 
Taubman College of Architecture 
and Urban Planning, addressed 
the environmental benefits of Ann 
Arbor residents living further 
downtown.
“The more people that live 
downtown, the more that walk 
and bike, and the less that 
commute by car,” Kelbaugh said. 
“They also live in smaller spaces 
which take less energy to heat and 
to cool, and there are just lots of 
advantages for urban living.”
According to the presenters, 

the East Washington high rise 
requires the demolition of five 
current buildings, it will meet 
LEED silver standards and it will 
have onsite parking. 
Commission members voiced 
concerns regarding room for 
Amazon deliveries, rideshares 
and 
food 
delivery 
services, 
solar energy and the amount of 
affordable housing, but ultimately 
the commission voted to approve 
both buildings.
The last item of business on 
the agenda was an amendment to 
create a new zoning designation 
called a T1 Transit Support 
district. The designation will 
allow 
for 
more 
mixed-use 
development further outside of 
downtown Ann Arbor, creating 
space for a transit corridor. 
City planner Alexis DiLeo said 
the T1 district will be the first 
Ann Arbor district to require both 
residential and commercial areas. 
It is designed to lower energy 
costs and needs for residents. 
She said there is a mixed-use 
requirement, and half of the 
floor area in all buildings, but no 
more than 66 percent of it must 
be used for household living. 
DiLeo added the current target 
area for the district is between 
Washtenaw Avenue, South State 
Street and East/West Eisenhower 
Boulevard. 
Meeting 
attendee 
Joan 
Lowenstein spoke for the board of 
the Washtenaw Housing Alliance. 
She said she is strongly in favor 
of the T1 district because it could 
help the environment and, in turn, 
create affordable housing options.
“I think we have two primary 
crises that are going on right now 
that affect local government: 
the first is climate change and 
the other is affordable housing,” 
Lowenstein said. “If we can 
reduce the need to use cars, that 
will go a long way towards helping 
us with climate change… I think 
this T1 district has great potential 
to increase affordability, not the 
least of which is making sure 
someone doesn’t need to have a 
car.”

Community 
member 

Adam 
Goodman 
said 
he 
“enthusiastically supports” the 
new zoning district. He echoed 
what 
Lowenstein 
said 
and 
discussed how allowing people 
to live close to where they work 
eliminates the need for driving 
everywhere .
“Simply put, we have to find 
ways to get people to be able to 
live closer to where they work, 
where they go to school and 
so on,” Goodman said. “What 
I see here is the beginning of 
a recognition that we need to 
work on housing for people and 
not for cars. This has more of 
an effect than you might think 
because if you remove the 
requirement for developers to 
build space for cars, that makes 
their costs go down, which 
means that the cost of the 
housing also goes down.”
Audience member Julie Ritter 
was not as enthusiastic about 
the T1 district. Ritter is on the 
committee for the Master Plan 
project, which sets Ann Arbor’s 
long term goals for growth and 
development, and has consulted 
nationally recognized groups for 
this work. She said if a T1 zone 
was a good idea, these groups 
would have suggested it. 
“Every 
single 
consultant 
group that we have interviewed 
has 
been 
a 
nationally 
recognized 
group,” 
Ritter 
said.“They are professionals, 
they have wide experience. Do 
you think they have not heard 
of T1 transit support districts? 
Do you think they would not 
recommend them? My other 
concern is the transit piece. 
Ann Arbor has no transit. We 
have a bus system that struggles 
mightily to provide service… 
to get into Ann Arbor you have 
to drive a car. Where are those 
cars going to go? The University 
is proposing a new hospital and 
a college of pharmacy with no 
new parking spaces. Where are 
these cars going to go? Until we 
get transit, why have a transit 
corridor?”

Weinstein shared how his 
first-hand experiences with 
Midwesterners helped him 
structure his stories.
“There is kind of that 
part of the safety that the 
way that people are very 
friendly in the Midwest, but 
also very distant internally,” 
Weinstein said. “And that 
creates 
this 
wonderful 
irony.”
Since 
Roth 
writes 
for 
an 
audience 
of 
primarilyteenagers 
and 
young adults, she has often 
been asked if she feels like 
she’s trying to teach a lesson 
through her readers. Roth 
said she doesn’t feel like 
her writing is supposed to 
teach — it’s meant to be an 
escape from the real world. 

Ultimately, Roth wants her 
writing to be a safe haven 
for young people. 
“I think that it’s pretty 
clear now that the youths 
don’t really need me to 
teach them things.” Roth 
said. “They have access to a 
lot more information than I 
ever did. They are way more 
aware of the world. They’re 
starting climate strikes and 
marching for our lives and 
I think what they need is 
a safe place to go and I can 
create that and a quiet place 
to think, then that’s all I can 
do.”
When asked about her 
process of writing dystopian 
novels, 
Roth 
mentioned 
she is usually a pessimistic 
person, but that changes 
when she starts writing. 
“I have a lot of pessimistic 
impulses, but when I write, 
I tend to challenge my own 

thoughts about the world 
and about people,” Roth 
said. “I’m a little pessimistic 
about people too, but when 
I write I find myself by 
having hope instead and … 
that’s why I do it.”
LSA 
freshman 
Molly 
Duplaga attended the event 
and was excited to hear 
from a successful female 
author. She thought both 
Roth and Weinstein had a 
lot of valuable information 
to share about writing and 
their own life experiences.
“I really enjoyed listening 
to Roth and Weinstein speak 
and hearing both of their 
thoughts on the process 
of writing,” Duplaga said. 
“They were fun to listen to 
and relatable. I liked how 
they both appreciated the 
Midwest and were able to 
put into words what it’s like 
to live here.”

LSA junior Alyssa Cutter is 
from Battle Creek, where two 
wolves were infected with 
EEE. Cutter said she wonders 
if the emergence of EEE is a 
result of climate change. 
“It will be interesting to 
see if this is something that 
emerges again next year and 
the year after that as we see 
the environment for mosquitos 
shifting with climate change,” 
Cutter said.
In 
addition, 
Cutter 
explained she has noticed 
the effects of EEE in her 
hometown, as Battle Creek 
has announced new safety 
measures. The measures have 

received 
some 
pushback, 
though, Cutter said. 
“Public 
health 
officials 
have put out information in 
the last few days that they’ll 
be doing aerial sprays with 
organic pesticide, and there’s 
actually been a lot of push 
back from those counties to 
get aerial spray taken off the 
agenda,” Cutter said. “People 
are worried about what it will 
do to their pets, inhaling the 
residue and the effects it will 
have on pollinators.”
According to their website 
as of Sept. 26, Washtenaw 
County Health Department 
will also participate in the 
aerial spraying of a small 
portion of Washtenaw County 
to combat the spread of the 
virus. It notes residents can 

opt out via email, but affirms 
aerial 
spraying 
does 
not 
carry any significant risks 
to human health, pets or the 
environment.
Since 
climate 
generally 
refers to a long period of time 
and this has been the only 
large 
occurrence 
of 
EEE, 
Spindler suspects weather is 
the source of the spread and 
reaffirms the importance of 
staying informed.
“People can always inform 
themselves by going to the CDC 
site, and there’s a really nice 
EEE virus page that has things 
about prevention, symptoms, 
transmission, statistics, links 
and references,” Spindler said. 
“For any infectious disease 
that you hear about, go to 
some reputable source.

Dingell’s 
late 
husband, 
former 
U.S. 
Rep. 
John 
Dingell, D-Mich., also used 
opioids to treat his pain 
from cancer. Dingell said it’s 
important not to stigmatize 
people with real pain and 
emphasized the need for 
alternative pain medication.
“We 
have 
to 
develop 
alternative pain pills, so that 
people get pain relief without 
becoming addicted, and we 
need to not stigmatize those 
who have real pain, or not 
give them the pills that they 
need, while at the same time, 
keeping our kids, keeping our 
neighbors, our families, from 
ever starting them,” Dingell 
said.
According 
to 
keynote 
speaker Adreanne Waller, an 
epidemiologist and author 
of the Washtenaw County 
Opioid 
Report, 
the 
first 
five months of 2019 have 
shown a decrease in opioid 
prescription and emergency 
overdose visits. 
Waller 
detailed 
a 
number 
of 
factors 
that 
contributed to the epidemic, 
including 
untreated 
mental 
health, 
corporate 
greed, unemployment and 
disabilities.
“There’s a number of — 
and I keep adding to this 
list — big issues that have 
become much more crystal 
clear over the years within 
this 
epidemic,” 
Waller 
said. “The historic, unjust 
responses to the crack and 
cocaine epidemic and how 
that 
injured 
generations 
of families. We’ve learned 
so 
much 
about 
other 
substance abuse disorders… 
the incredible, high profit 
margins 
of 
marketing 
addictive 
substances, 

untreated 
mental 
health, 
mental 
illness 
affects 
changes 
in 
healthcare 
delivery, deepen social ties, 
employment and disability 
challenges, as well as linked 
with 
lacking 
economic 
opportunity. This list gets 
longer and longer.”
Waller also said 2,100 
of 
300,000 
emergency 
department 
visits 
from 
January 2011 to May 2019 
in Washtenaw County were 
related to opioid poisoning, 
and those with Medicaid 
seem to exhibit higher rates 
of visits to the ER concerning 
repeat opioid overdoses.
Waller, along with others 
at the summit, said she 
believes treating childhood 
trauma 
may 
be 
key 
to 
preventing opioid addiction.
“I 
really 
feel 
that 
understanding more about 
the link between trauma 
and opiate overdoses might 
enable us to identify trauma 
as almost the preventative 
test 
— 
mammography, 
if you will — that will 
prevent ultimately an opiate 
overdose,” 
Waller 
said. 
“It helps us to see things 
much earlier than we would 
otherwise. And if that pain, 
that that person has, is 
covered up with a chemical 
euphoria, like opioids, it can 
delay treatment until the 
cancer has spread.”
Adverse 
Childhood 
Experiences, or ACEs, is the 
terminology for measuring 
childhood 
trauma. 
According 
to 
the 
World 
Health Organization, ACEs 
is the most important health 
discovery of the century. 
Zaire 
Totty, 
project 
coordinator for the System 
for 
Opioid 
Overdose 
Surveillance at the University 
of 
Michigan 
Injury 
Prevention Center, said this 
event is a good opportunity 

to bring together people 
from different fields.
“I 
think 
it’s 
a 
good 
opportunity for a lot of the 
different stakeholders to get 
together as well, especially 
because this is an epidemic 
that comes from so many 
different 
parts 
of 
public 
health,” Totty said. “With 
prescribers and recreational 
use, I really think it’s a good 
time to get individuals from 
different disciplines that are 
working on this topic.”
Amy 
Rucker, 
project 
coordinator 
for 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
Injury Prevention Center, 
acknowledged 
the 
importance 
of 
bringing 
together the community to 
discuss the issue.
“I 
think 
it’s 
really 
important to bring different 
stakeholders and providers 
from 
across 
Washtenaw 
County and across the state 
… to an event to talk about 
something 
so 
important,” 
Rucker 
said. 
“Yet 
even 
within 
organizations 
within the University of 
Michigan, we have a lot of 
different projects and and a 
lot of different centers and 
institutes working on the 
opioid epidemic … So just 
bringing everyone together 
in one space, we get to learn 
what 
everyone’s 
doing. 
We can collaborate, make 
meaningful connections.”
Sarah 
Khan, 
a 
student 
studying 
social 
work 
at 
Eastern Michigan University, 
emphasized the importance of 
the opioid crisis in relation to her 
career path.
“As 
somebody 
who’s 
majoring in social work, I think 
it’s really important to know 
different things that affect 
your community,” Khan said.

Johnson 
said 
the 
ban 
ignores the true reason kids 
vape. 
“What we found out is that 
kids aren’t really attracted 
to the flavors, they’re not 
opposed,” Johnson said. “But 
what they’re attracted to is 
the buzz that they’re gonna 
get 
from 
these 
nicotine 
products, 
and 
they 
are 
usually buying the highest 
nicotine level out there — 
usually around five to seven 
percent.”
After speaking with small 
shop vape owners, Johnson 
said the largest sales come 
from those trying to quit 
smoking, 
who 
typically 
buy products that contain 
nicotine levels at 2 percent 
or lower. 
“If you allow for the low-
level nicotine products that 
are flavored for e-cigarettes, 
the kids aren’t going to be 
gravitating 
towards 
them 
because they don’t get that 
same buzz,” Johnson said.
“The fact of the matter is 
that 65 percent of the kids 
are using mint-flavor vaping 
products,” 
Johnson 
said. 
“The reason they’re using 
mint is because that’s what 
the common flavor for is for 
those 
high-nicotine-level 
products.” 
Rep. 
Beau 
LaFave, 
R-District 
108, 
also 
introduced a bill that would 

overturn the ban. He spoke 
to The Daily about what 
his bill would do, primarily 
restricting 
Whitmer’s 
abilities to declare this as a 
health emergency.
“House Bill 4996 removes 
the governor’s ability to ban 
e-flavored nicotine products 
for adults in the state of 
Michigan and would remove 
her ability (to do so) under 
the emergency health crisis 
act,” LaFave said. 
He said the emergency 
health crisis act was meant 
to address highly contagious 
illnesses. 
“When 
we 
drafted 
the 
statute that gave the governor 
the ability to declare a state of 
emergency for emerging health 
crises, we were thinking about 
things such as bird flu or HIV 
or any other communicable 
disease that could theoretically 
spread as an epidemic,” LaFave 
said. “What (it’s) not designed 
for is things that the governor 
doesn’t like.” 
LaFave said the ban does not 
even address the actual issues, 
which he says are marijuana 
vaping products that contain 
vitamin E. 
“The governor’s ban does 
not affect the actual substances 
that are causing these illnesses,” 
LaFave said. “A study out of 
one of our sister states found 
that over 85 percent of those 
who reported illnesses using 
vaping products were using 
black market marijuana vaping 
products.” 
LaFave told The Daily about 

a vape shop owner in Hope, 
Michigan, who has an 87-year-
old customer who quit smoking 
cigarettes by vaping. He said her 
favorite flavor is Fruity Pebbles 
and believes she is an example 
of how flavored products are not 
geared toward children. 
“That’s what got her to quit 
after 50 years of smoking,” 
LaFave said. 
LSA junior Caroline Nelson 
said she supports Whitmer’s 
ban because she feels it is clearly 
aimed toward protecting the 
younger generations. 
“I agree with it,” Nelson said. 
“I don’t think people should be 
selling things or smoking that 
are so fruity. It’s clearly targeted 
towards younger kids.” 
Nelson said she used to 
vape, but after recent reports of 
vaping-related illnesses, she 
has tried to stop using the 
product. 
“I started Juuling probably 
two years ago and I’m now 
starting to wean off,” Nelson 
said. “It’s so bad for you and 
all these articles are coming 
out and people are having 
seizures, it’s really scary.”
Nelson does not think 
Whitmer’s ban should be 
undercut in any way. 
“It 
makes 
me 
think, 
‘Who do these e-cigarette 
companies and Juul have 
in 
Congress 
that 
they’re 
paying 
to 
overturn 
(this 
ban)?’” Nelson said. “There’s 
no reason people should be 
pushing to allow people to 
smoke.”

The University of Michigan 
Sustainable 
Food 
Systems 
Initiative held its 6th annual 
Fast Food For Thought event 
Tuesday night. Nine speakers 
presented on a range of topics 
surrounding sustainable food 
to over 200 students. 
The speakers each had five 
minutes to present their topic, 
creating a fast-paced series 
of lectures. Topics ranged 
from 
childhood 
obesity, 
presented 
by 
Assistant 
Professor Katherine Bauer, to 
Professor John Vandermeer’s 
discussion of sustainability 
in Puerto Rico during the 
current political climate. 
Students 
in 
attendance 
appreciated the short format 
of the talks. LSA junior Mark 
Castaneda said he felt the 
talk was easier to absorb than 
other longer, more research-
heavy events. 
“When you’re talking about 
research, it gets really hard 
to keep people’s attention 
for a long time, so having 
[the presentations] be five 

minutes is really effective,” 
Castaneda said.
Some 
other 
topics 
covered 
included 
analysis 
of whether meal kit services 
can 
be 
environmentally 
friendly. 
Program 
in 
the 
Environment 
director 
Shelie Miller discussed her 
research surrounding meal 
kit services, and whether the 
excess packaging prevents 
sustainability. Miller found 
that, though grocery stores 
have less packaging, using 
meal kits is actually more 
sustainable than shopping at 
the grocery store due to the 
amount of waste emitted in 
each scenario. 
Ultimately, 
Miller 
concluded 
the 
packaging 
wasn’t the deciding factor. 
Instead, it was what was 
in the package that made 
something sustainable or not. 
“It doesn’t matter how you 
get your food,” Miller said. “It 
matters what the protein is.” 
Other speakers, such as 
School 
for 
Environment 
and Sustainability research 
fellow Martin Heller and 
School 
of 
Public 
Health 
research 
fellow 
Katerina 

Stylianou, also focused on 
the issue of protein. They said 
beef was a huge outlier when 
it came to food consumption’s 
effect on the environment. 
Stylianou 
attempted 
to 
answer the question “should 
we all become vegan?” and 
found replacing beef and 
processed meats with more 
sustainable foods such as 
nuts and fruits could lead 
to a 40-percent reduction 
in our carbon footprint, and 
add 50 minutes per day to 
that 
person’s 
life. 
Heller 
stressed the importance of 
institutional change when 
looking 
at 
food 
system’s 
effects on the environment, 
pointing out altering what 
kind of foods universities and 
other large institutions serve 
could have a huge impact on 
the way food consumption 
affects the environment. 
LSA senior Caroline Hall 
told The Daily she thought 
the event was a great way to 
be introduced to numerous 
topics 
surrounding 
food 
systems.

E

very semester, after my last 
final exam, I have a ritual: 
tidy up my living space and 
pack my bags for a trip home while 
Michael Jackson’s 1979 Off the Wall 
album plays in the background. I 
like to pull up the album’s YouTube 
playlist so that its music videos 
display on my laptop screen. The 
opening track, “Don’t Stop ‘Til You 
Get Enough,” is the perfect end-
of-term song. “Lovely, is the feelin’ 
now,” belts Jackson, as his tuxedoed 
figure dances superimposed over a 
series of abstract shapes and colors. 
This song was Jackson’s leap into 
independence as an adult recording 
artist — he penned its lyrics and 
composed its driving groove himself, 
and the single was released just after 
his 21st birthday. The tune creates an 
aura of exuberance — it feels good to 
listen to.
Off the Wall has a shimmering 
airiness that masks the power with 
which it propelled Jackson’s career 
forward. Over the next decade, 
Jackson would moonwalk, zombie-
dance and “hee-hee” his way into 
a superstardom that seemed to 
transcend reality. The album also 
masked a concerning development: 
the descent of a deeply troubled 
mind whose owner would come to 
destroy the personal lives of young 
boys and their families.
In January 2019, HBO released 
“Leaving Neverland,” a two-part 
documentary covering the stories of 
two men who made startling claims 
about sexual abuse they suffered 
at the hands of Jackson as children 
in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 
Their allegations were the biggest 
brought against Jackson since his 
child molestation lawsuits in 1993 
and 2003, neither of which he faced 
charges for. Their depictions of 
abuse and the way Jackson used 
his celebrity to manipulate families 
make one’s stomach turn. Unlike 
previous cases against Jackson, 
the details in this documentary 
are 
cohesive, 
compelling 
and 
hard to ignore. Its release created 
shockwaves that threatened to 
finally defame the King of Pop’s 
legacy and banish his body of work 
into oblivion.

These 
threats, 
however, 
are 
illusory. Michael Jackson cannot 
be erased from society. His cultural 
mark is too deep. Since his death 
in 2009, Thriller (1982) has sold 
millions of copies, and despite the 
initial backlash against Jackson, 
online streaming traffic for his music 
increased following the release of 
“Leaving Neverland”. In the past 
month alone, I have heard his songs 
played at Maizie’s in the League and 
Computer Showcase at the Shapiro 
Undergraduate Library. Michael 
Jackson isn’t going anywhere.
How, then, do we deal with the 
legacy of someone whose work is so 
invaluable but whose deeds are so 
unforgivable?
Legacies are built on what 
we know – concrete facts and 
memorable events. Impressive feats 
associated with Michael Jackson 
as 
a 
professional 
entertainer 
are innumerable. He won an 
unprecedented eight awards at the 
1984 Grammys and broke MTV 
racial barriers with Thriller, one 
of the best-selling albums of all 
time. In 1993, he became the first 
major musical star to headline the 
Super Bowl Halftime Show. His live 
performances of “Billie Jean” were 
clinics in solo excellence: a man with 
a microphone and an empty stage, 
working song and dance magic.
Jackson’s public life as an artist 
was captivating. His precocious 
talent and demanding father forced 
him into the recording industry as 
a young child, depriving him of a 
normal childhood. He was aware 
of his immeasurable gifts as an 
entertainer and worked tirelessly 
at perfecting his craft. He had 
ambition and lofty professional 
expectations for himself. From his 
mind came timeless musical hits 
and groundbreaking music video 
concepts. In his prime, he was one 
of the most famous and beloved 
figures in the world, taking stages 
globally with charm, authority and 
electrifying energy. This is the side of 
Jackson the public knew and adored.
Yet behind every spin, every glide, 
every “cha-mone,” was a man who 
seemed to be facing internal turmoil. 
The most obvious manifestation was 

written on his very face – Jackson was 
never satisfied with his appearance 
and 
consequently 
destroyed 
it 
with dozens of misguided plastic 
surgeries, looking like a different 
person every decade. His behaviors 
became more eccentric and unusual 
as his career arc descended in 
the late ’90s and early 2000s. He 
identified with Peter Pan and shared 
his bed with young boys even after 
his first child molestation lawsuit, 
calling his practice “the most loving 
thing to do.” He was, in short, a very 
sick man.
Because of the stark contrast 
between Jackson’s famous stage 
persona and the reclusive, troubled 
human behind it, the public has never 
had a strong grasp of who Michael 
Jackson truly is. His personality, 
lifestyle and the numerous child 
abuse allegations against him are all 
subjects of mystery. It is challenging 
to attribute aspects of Jackson’s 
backstage life to a physical person 
because we don’t feel we know who 
that person is. As a consequence, 
what is forever associated with 
Jackson are things we do feel we 
understand – his music, videos and 
live performances. This, ultimately, 
is what keeps Jackson immortal. 
His artistry was phenomenal and 
therefore will withstand the test of 
time.
If we will not erase Jackson from 
our culture, then it is important for 
us to make sure that nobody with 
power like Jackson’s is able to use it to 
cause the kind of harm that he did in 
the future. Jackson’s legacy is saved 
from further harm partly because 
he is deceased – he cannot be put 
in jail and suffer the reputational 
injury that comes with a sentencing. 
The #MeToo movement has been 
instrumental in bringing awareness 
to and increasing reporting of 
sexual misconduct. Its trajectory 
should continue so that everybody 
is held accountable for their actions 
regardless of status. This will help 
ensure that moving forward, those 
who use their power for harm are 
not idolized by future generations.

Michael Jackson’s complicated legacy

On impeachment: It was all this, or a woman

DIPRA DEBNATH | COLUMN

L

isten, I really don’t want to 
relitigate the 2016 election. 
It was heart-wrenching, 
frightening 
and 
all-around 
anxiety-inducing. The most vivid 
memory I have from the day after 
the election is walking into school 
and collapsing into the arms of 
friends, all of us weeping and 
disillusioned. But it is important to 
examine the outcome of the 2016 
election through the lens of what 
we know now. 
On Tuesday Sep. 24, House 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced 
a formal impeachment inquiry 
into President Donald Trump. 
Pelosi, 
who 
has 
previously 
expressed hesitation on the topic 
of impeachment, cited a recent 
whistleblower account of Trump 
asking 
Ukrainian 
President 
Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate 
former Vice President Joe Biden as 
a “favor” for U.S. defense support. 
In 
the 
announcement, 
Pelosi 
stressed Trump must be held 
accountable for soliciting foreign 
governments to investigate his 
political opponents in an attempt 
to gain an advantage in the 2020 
election. 
Though 
impeachment 
investigations are ramping up, 
this is certainly not the first 
controversy of Trump’s presidency, 
nor is it the first potentially 
impeachable 
investigation 
into 
his administration. There was a 
Department of Justice investigation 
by special counsel Robert Mueller 
into whether Trump and his 
campaign conspired with the 
Russian government in the 2016 
election. In this investigation, the 
former FBI director and his team 
indicted, convicted or received 
guilty pleas from 34 individuals 
and three companies involving top 
Trump advisers, Russian actors 
and hackers associated with the 
Kremlin, which can be found in 
the full report. There are also 
several 
ongoing 
congressional 
investigations of Trump, including 
obstruction of justice and his tax 
returns. 
Of 
course, 
the 
Trump 
administration is also involved 
in 
almost-daily 
scandals 
that 
are not explicitly illegal. A non-
comprehensive 
list 
includes 

separating children from their 
parents at the border, calling 
majority-people of color countries 
“shitholes,” nominating a man 
credibly accused of sexual assault 
to the Supreme Court, being 
credibly accused of sexual assault 
himself, attempting to ban Muslims 
from entering the U.S., calling 
white supremacists “very fine 
people” and denying the existence 
of climate change.
It was all this and more, or a 
woman. 
And not just any woman. If not 
the most, she was one of the most 
qualified people to run for president 
ever. She was a Yale-trained lawyer, 
first lady of the United States, U.S. 
senator and secretary of state. 
Yes, she was connected with 
controversy throughout her public 
life. And yes, she was slightly more 
moderate than my own personal 
politics. But running against a 
man so unqualified and immoral, 
she undoubtedly should have been 
president of the United States.
While 
Trump 
and 
his 
Republican 
supporters 
may 
believe Democrats are frothing 
with delight at the thought of 
impeaching Trump, it does not feel 
good to be reminded of what could 
have been. Sure, I’m comforted 
by the fact that our efforts in the 
2018 midterms will not be all for 
nothing, but I’m certainly not 
thrilled at the fact that we have to 
go to such extreme lengths to stop 
Trump from committing crimes 
and trying to use foreign assistance 
to win the next election. Really 
though, it feels terrible that had we 
elected her we may have extended 
health insurance to millions more 
Americans, passed laws to stop gun 
violence and began appropriately 
responding to the crisis of climate 
change among several other issues. 
As much as we all have the right 
to be angry on her behalf and on 
behalf of every single person who 
has been hurt by Trump’s policies, 
there is no justice for 2016. There 
is only redemption in 2020, but 
impeaching Trump for his crimes 
will ensure he goes down in history 
with a scarlett asterisk next to his 
name, forever indicative of his 
illegitimacy. 
While 
I 
am 
content 
with 

watching 
this 
administration 
explode in its own incompetence 
and 
criminality, 
it 
is 
worth 
considering how our failure in 2016 
has the potential to fail us again in 
2020. And to be clear, coming back 
from as low as we’ve gone will take 
an incredible amount of individual 
and collective self-reflection. With 
2020 in full swing as the Democratic 
caucuses and primaries are mere 
months away, the impeachment 
inquiry serves as a stark reminder 
of the consequences of 2016 and 
our inability to stop Trump’s 
ascendancy.
Right now, the leading contender 
for the Democratic nomination, Joe 
Biden, campaigns heavily on his 
electability — that he has a unique 
ability to beat Trump in the general 
election because he can appeal 
to the white working class and 
moderate independent voters, two 
essential demographic groups to 
Trump’s win in 2016. One can think 
he is the best person for the job, 
but one should choose him for that 
reason and not some biased notion 
of electability, which often favors 
the most privileged among us and 
marginalizes candidates who don’t 
look like 44 of the 45 total former 
U.S. presidents.
To make an electability argument, 
we have to rely on our instincts about 
what a president looks like, sounds 
like and feels like — who inspires 
us, who we can relate to, who we 
can imagine as the most powerful 
leader in the world. But our instincts 
failed in 2016. We were wrong; all 
of us, despite who we voted for, are 
implicated in the election of Donald 
Trump. Some of us — specifically, 
about 43 percent of the country — 
may not want to admit it, but we’ll 
all look back at this grave error in 
history with consternation and 
shame, just as we do with Andrew 
Jackson and Andrew Johnson and 
Richard Nixon. The only question 
left is whether we will continue to 
vote with the same impulses that 
gave us an impeachable president 
in the first place — fear, bigotry and 
nationalism — or we will redeem 
ourselves by voting with courage and 
aspiration.

Trudeau and progressive white 
hypocrisy

O

n Sep. 18, photos surfaced of Canadian Prime Minister Justin 
Trudeau wearing brownface, followed by the news of two 
more instances in blackface. Trudeau, the Leader of the 
Liberal Party, immediately apologized for his past actions, stating he 
did not consider them racist at the time but should have known better. 

These photographs come 
at a crucial point for Trudeau 
and the Liberal Party of 
Canada, as they are currently 
less than one month away 
from Parliamentary elections. 
Considering Trudeau has 
portrayed himself and his 
Parliament as a beacon of 
progressive 
politics, 
these 
harmful 
acts 
exhibit 
a 
profound level of hypocrisy. 
This is not limited to past 
offenses but shows itself in 
many of his behaviors and 
policies during his time as 
prime minister. Though he 
has championed himself as 
enlightened, 
the 
privileges 
he holds as a wealthy, white 
man 
make 
him 
blind 
to 
the truly damaging effects 
of 
his 
transgressions. 
If 
re-elected this fall, Trudeau 
has 
a 
responsibility 
to 
support policies and focus 
on 
communities 
he 
has 
previously 
neglected. 
In 
order to uphold his own and 
his country’s reputation as 
progressive leaders, he must 
demonstrate his commitment 
to equality through actions, 
not just through words.
To 
many, 
revelations 
about Trudeau’s racist past 
have 
shaken 
an 
idealized 
view of the prime minister. 
However, these are not the 
only instances in which he has 
contradicted his purported 
ideals. He has long held a 
contentious 
relationship 
with 
Canada’s 
indigenous 
persons, demonstrated by his 
approval of the controversial 
Trans 
Mountain 
pipeline 
expansion 
that 
threatens 
native lands. Trudeau has 
also 
been 
criticized 
for 
sarcastic comments he made 
toward an indigenous activist 
advocating 
for 
mercury 
poisoning 
compensation. 
Beyond his poor track record 
with Canada’s First Nations 
population, Trudeau has faced 
accusations of violating ethics 
laws by trying to pressure 
his former justice minister 
and Attorney General Jody 
Wilson-Raybould 
to 
drop 
charges against a company 

based in Quebec. As Canada’s 
first 
Indigenous 
Justice 
Minister, Wilson-Raybould’s 
resignation was viewed as a 
setback in the reconciliation 
process by many Indigenous 
leaders. 
The 
damages 
of 
Trudeau’s ignorance are not 
limited to Canada; during 
an official visit to India in 
February 2018, Trudeau and 
his family drew criticism for 
overdoing 
their 
traditional 
attire, 
entering 
“costume 
territory” and appropriating 
Indian culture. These offenses 
while in office indicate his 
past 
racist 
behaviors 
are 
part of a larger pattern of his 
privilege and ignorance.
World leaders must be held 
to the ideals they promote, 
and Trudeau is no exception. 
It’s true that Trudeau has 
taken some actions reflective 
of his liberal ideals while in 
office. Upon entering office in 
2015, he named Canada’s first 
gender-balanced cabinet. He 
has been a vocal advocate for 
refugees, though amid recent 
pressures 
from 
Canada’s 
right wing, he has supported 
a far less welcoming policy 
regarding asylum seekers at 
the U.S.-Canada border. Under 
his leadership, his parliament 
has made a concerted effort 
to fix the environmental laws 
implemented by the previous 
Conservative administration. 
However, in order to continue 
promoting 
himself 
as 
a 
forward-looking frontrunner, 
he must adhere to these ideals 
consistently in his policies 
and his personal life. A mere 
image of progressiveness is not 
enough; this progressiveness 
must be reflected in Trudeau’s 
actions. Like any leader, he 
has a duty to stick to his 
promises.
As students at an elite 
university, 
we 
are 
being 
primed to become leaders 
in our respective fields. For 
many, this includes politics 
and business. Trudeau’s racist 
wrongdoings 
demonstrate 
that we have a responsibility 
to 
thoroughly 
educate 
ourselves on other cultures 

and 
communities. 
It 
is 
imperative to acknowledge 
how our privilege and actions 
impact others. Otherwise, we 
are contributing further harm 
to our environment as well as 
depriving ourselves of a well-
rounded education. As future 
members of the workforce, 
we 
must 
understand 
the 
histories of harm and violence 
inflicted upon other cultures. 
This includes understanding 
why blackface still causes 
damage. Progress cannot be 
made when we don’t do the 
necessary work of confronting 
our biases and the impact of 
our privilege. 
However, 
broadening 
cultural 
understanding 
and appreciation does not 
mean adopting cultures as 
our own. Even when well-
intentioned, 
the 
racist 
fashions 
of 
appropriation 
further violate communities. 
Cultural appropriation erases 
histories, distorts diversity 
and promotes stereotypes. It 
is the very mistake Trudeau 
made when he intentionally 
chose to wear brownface and 
blackface. However, this does 
not mean Trudeau should 
be 
immediately 
dismissed. 
Instead, 
his 
actions 
can 
serve 
as 
a 
reminder 
for 
self-reflection 
and 
change. 
Especially as students, we 
should 
embrace 
expanding 
diversity 
and 
inclusivity, 
not in fear of being caught 
but because of our inherent 
eagerness to learn. 
It is clearly disheartening 
when a beloved politician’s 
racist past is revealed. Justin 
Trudeau has been commonly 
viewed as a champion of 
progressivism, but with each 
racist act our trust in him 
continues to falter. Trudeau 
faces a long road of re-earning 
respect and trust, especially 
from Canadians. Yet, it is 
important we do not demonize 
Trudeau, 
but 
rather 
take 
time to reflect and educate 
ourselves. We cannot change 
Trudeau’s past, but we can 
learn from him and strive for 
improvement.

The sprawling gray highways will attempt 
to convince you that the most direct route 
is the best one. These concrete trails are 
hypnotic, tiring, blending into each other. 
You think you’re making progress, getting 
closer. But somehow you’re still so far away. 
You keep driving. This is how they get you. 
Please don’t fall for it.
Roads seem like they’ll lead you anywhere. 
You can take I-94 eastbound from Chicago 
to Canada. Detroit has roads spitting off 
directly in every direction. Roads named 
after the towns they pass through. Roads 
named after people. Roads to turn you back 
around.
“I’ll be taking any beauty I see / And I’ll 
try to give it to ya.” So shouts Max Kerman 
on the titular track of Arkells’ 2011 album, 
Michigan Left. These lovely Canadians from 
Hamilton may have written a song about 
Detroit, but these words don’t lead me there. 
Not yet, at least.
To make a left turn, you have to go right. 
Then you make a u-turn at a median. This 
is the Michigan Left. It’s Detroit’s own 
special concrete conundrum. It takes a little 
longer. It’s not a direct route. It’s managed 
to infuriate Michigan consistently since one 
popped up in 1960. (It’s universally despised, 
I promise.) But we’ve gotten really good at it. 
I don’t mean that we’ve gotten good only at 
taking Michigan Lefts. I mean we’ve gotten 
good at taking the long way home.
The Midwest is slow. Our towns are small. 
Most of it is covered by trees. A good chunk 
of it borders Canada. The chunk that doesn’t 
is surrounded by golden walls of corn. This is 
all to say, we have a lot of time on our hands. 
A good thing, too, because it’ll take you seven 
hours to get from Detroit to Marquette. But 

even if you take the most direct route there 
— I-75, to M-123, to M-28 — what will you 
pass through? Through Flint and around 
Saginaw. Though Grayling and Wolverine. 
That’s all before you crest the Mighty Mac 
over the Straits of Mackinac. If miss any of 
it, all you’ve seen is distant white pine and 
worn highway.
Wherever you go, you may make a 
Michigan Left or ten. Stopping to get gas, 
being robbed of your sense of direction or 
chasing a bear through the woods in your 
Jeep because you want to hang out with him 
(highly discouraged, leave bears alone — I 
had fun, the bear did not). Without these 
things, a journey isn’t a journey at all. It’s 
you, stuck in a box for hours while the world 
revolves past you. Just because you arrive 
somewhere doesn’t mean how you got there 
didn’t matter. That time’s lost if it’s not 
cherished.
There’s a combined total of over 425 miles 
of Michigan Lefts stretching across each of 
these pleasant peninsulas. Their purpose 
is safety. But their function is humility. 
Taking a Michigan Left isn’t an impediment. 
It’s an opportunity to slow down, to ease 
the highway’s beating on your temples and 
patience. Every Michigan Left and diversion 
is the prospect to take in the beauty of a 
Michigan that’s sprawled out in front of you.
We are all going somewhere. There’s a trail 
we’ve each been following. Maybe you need 
to go see your father because he really does 
love you, even if he has trouble showing it. 
Maybe you need to meet up for coffee with a 
friend who’s a little more like a stranger now. 
Maybe you’re trying to remember how to love 
someone who’s hurt you. Maybe you’re just 
trying to get better. Wherever you’re going, 
you’ll get there. I only hope you’ll remember 
your Michigan Lefts. Take all the beauty you 
see and try to give it to yourself — for real 
this time. Please remember to take the long 
way home.

Michigan Lefts, or taking
some beauty for yourself

If “Judy” doesn’t rocket Renée Zellweger 
(“Bridget Jones’s Diary”) to the top of the Oscar 
shortlist, there’s no point in even holding the 
ceremony. Her performance as Judy Garland 
is a triumph and the towering foundation 
upon which the movie rests. It’s no simple 
impersonation or prosthetic guise. Zellweger’s 
work is a marvel of research, empathy and 
bravery. This is the performance of the year, 
one worth all the hype surrounding it.
Though now considered a screen legend for 
her role as Dorothy in “The Wizard of Oz,” 
Garland and her career were in trouble in 1968, 
when “Judy” begins. Garland and her young 
kids are living in hotel rooms as she plays any 
venue that will take her — Garland’s unreliable 
reputation has blacklisted her in Hollywood. 
Substance abuse is also evident; there’s a 
particularly cutting moment when Garland’s 
daughter begs her not to “go to sleep” as she 
takes pills after a show. When Garland’s 
ex-husband, played by Rufus Sewell (“The Man 
in The High Castle”), takes her to court for 
custody of their children, she goes to London 
to perform dinner theatre so she can pay her 
debts.
While intriguing, the plot isn’t what makes 
the movie so phenomenal. It’s who personifies 
it. Zellweger elevates every scene she’s in with 
her unbelievable dedication and craft. She fully 
inhabits Judy Garland in a way few actors ever 
do. From the accent to the physicality to the 
classic contralto, she nails it. Her Garland is 
arresting, and never lets the viewer go until the 
final cut to black. It is a character both iconic 
and sympathetic, both exalting and tragic.
The cinematography is bracingly intimate and 
perfectly captures the polarities of Garland’s 
life, from sunny Hollywood parties to a cold 
bathroom floor after a bender. Most recent 
musical biopics like “Bohemian Rhapsody” 
and “Rocketman” have been nostalgia trips, 
glossing over issues or complications in favor of 
sparkling musical numbers and heartwarming 
epiphanies. While “Judy” sublimely channels 
Judy Garland’s beauty and talent, it never shies 
away from what made her so complex.

The nostalgia, mostly present in the lavish 
costumes, 
music 
and 
production 
design, 
never overshadows the complicated reality 
of Zellweger’s life. “Judy” veers away from 
mythologizing, presenting the star’s troubles 
with brutal, unflinching honesty. Garland 
was an icon, but also suffered from severe 
psychological issues. Exploring this idea, the 
film ingeniously blends together moments 
from Garland’s past during the production of 
“The Wizard of Oz,” with the main story. These 
flashbacks aren’t a gimmick — they carry 
vital narrative weight. Throughout, Garland’s 
childhood traumas parallel their consequences 
in her later years, to crushing effect.
Because Zellweger’s Garland is so utterly 
fantastic, the other characters can’t help but 
be dimmed by her gigantic star. Certain plot 
threads, especially concerning Garland’s final 
husband, played by Finn Wittrock (“American 
Horror Story”), either fall flat or end without 
resolution. Michael Gambon (“Harry Potter 
and the Prisoner of Azkaban”) appears, but the 
legendary actor never has much to do. A plotline 
with two gay fans who take Garland in for a 
night does tread the line with sentimentality, 
seeming a little too sweet, but is tied up in a way 
that doesn’t threaten the realism of the main 
story. None of this really matters, though —not 
when Zellweger is on screen. Judy Garland was 
a star for the ages, and Zellweger has given her 
an immortalization to match.

‘Judy’ is simply phenomenal

OIL OF EVERY PEARL’S UN-INSIDES is an 
audioscape odyssey. Whether it’s the oppressive, 
raunchy noise of “Ponyboy” or the syrupy, electric 
buildup of “Is It Cold In The Water?,” SOPHIE 
weaves a unique sound on OIL drawn from so 
many different ideas that it nearly renders her 
music labelless. Nebulous titles like “avant-garde” 
or “experimental” don’t do justice to the respect 
SOPHIE pays to art pop, glitch, industrial and 
ambient music. Fans of any or all of the above can 
find beauty in how they culminate in OIL.
OIL doesn’t hesitate to draw out raw emotion. 
It begins with a call for vulnerability on “It’s Okay 
To Cry.” SOPHIE’s heartfelt whispers speak to the 
soul. She introduces a motif she carries throughout 
the album, a ‘world inside.’ The concept climaxes 
on “Whole New World/Pretend World,” a nine-

minute monster of a finale that evolves and 
deepens with every passing minute. On this track 
she builds the world inside, but she chases that gap 
between physical expression and inner being all 
across OIL, like on “Infatuation” and especially 
“Immaterial.”
“Immaterial” is a powerhouse pop cut embedded 
in a project full of eccentric industrial compositions 
and swanky ambient soundscapes, but it’s no less 
evocative. The lyrics are provoking: A meditation 
on the relationship between physicality and 
identity, SOPHIE challenges her listeners to 
contemplate divorcing the two. Cowriter Cecile 
Believe sings with visceral emotion, “I was just a 
lonely girl / In the eyes of my inner child … I don’t 
even have to explain / Just leave me alone now.”
The lyrics speak to a criticism levied at SOPHIE 
earlier in her career, encapsulated by a 2014 article 
in The Fader that argued she was intentionally 
obscuring a male identity and appropriating 
femininity in her artistry. SOPHIE would later 
come out as transgender. The position she takes on 
“Immaterial” is reminiscent of a groundbreaking 
essay published on Medium challenging the 
idea that the only real transwoman is an out 
transwoman. The song’s ultimate declaration? 
SOPHIE owes her listeners nothing. It’s a 
message that resonates.
“Faceshopping” is a similar exploration 
of personal expression and invention. The 
percussion screeches and sputters, clanks 
and clatters, drilling and drumming and 
whirring and humming a cacophony of facial 
construction. Over two minutes are spent 
manufacturing, the tools voiced in a low 
rumble: “Artificial bloom / Hydroponic skin / 
Chemical release.” Then the beat switches and 
for a moment, all the faceshopping culminates 
in dazzling brilliance, twinkling keys and a 
stunning falsetto. Only 45 seconds later it’s 
gone, the shimmer of radiance is scrapped, the 
factory returns. The face is back in the shop.
A 
theme 
of 
formed 
and 
constructed 
expression draws an interesting parallel to 
SOPHIE’s production style. It might be more 
accurate to call her a sound designer than a 
record producer. For much of her production, 
the gloss and polish isn’t made of instrumental 
samples, but literally built from waveforms. 
OIL is in-your-face artificial, and expertly 

sculpted to sound like it. She embraces her style 
on the ambient track “Pretending,” building an 
awe-inspiring and ear-embracing resonance full 
of richness and lucidity. Sandwiched between 
the spine-chilling synths of “Not Okay” and the 
bubblegum pop of “Immaterial,” SOPHIE throws 
in twist after twist for listeners on OIL.
Records 
composed 
at 
such 
a 
high 

calibre don’t come around often — OIL is 
positioned to be inspiring the producers of the next 
decade. SOPHIE is glitzy, SOPHIE is glamorous, 
and her masterpiece OIL OF EVERY PEARL’S 
UN-INSIDES 
is 
consistently 
unpredictable, 
organically artificial. It’s a landmark in music 
production and it’s heart-heavy with agony and 
ecstasy.

My 2019 New Year’s resolution was to only 
purchase books written by women. Given the 
beyond-scary statistics of male authors being 
published around eight and a half times more 
frequently than their female counterparts, I 
recognized the only way to beat the statistic 
is to support female authors and share their 
books. Ironically, I’d read Peg Alford Pursell’s 
debut collection “Show Her A Flower, A Bird, 
A Shadow” in 2017, prior to realizing she was 
joining us at Literati to celebrate her newest 
collection of fables and stories, titled “A Girl 
Goes into The Forest.” 
Pursell is known for her lyrical prose and 
imaginative world building. Although she’s an 
advanced, published writer, she did not think of 
becoming a writer as a young person. 
“I grew up in a small town in the Allegheny 
Mountains where there was no bookstore, not 
even in the two closest cities, and I’d never met 
a writer and was unaware of anyone who wrote 
— practical occupations were encouraged. Yet, I 
always wrote,” Pursell said in an interview with 
The Daily. Pursell’s prose writing is extremely 
visceral and poetic — it builds worlds around 
you as you read. As a young person, she won 
awards for her poetry, and in her adult writing 
career, she’s honed her poetic expertise in her 
prose. 
Despite her recent success, Pursell wasn’t 
always confident in herself as a writer. Even 
after her MFA graduation from the Warren 
Wilson College program for writers, she claims 
she suffered a “crisis of confidence.” Her first 
book was featured by Poets & Writers magazine 
and was also named the INDIES “Book of the 
Year for Literary Fiction.” Though she had a 
few slow moments in her early career, she has 
since thrived in the literary world. Her most 
recent collection was published in July of 2019, 
and she just finished putting the final touches 
on the manuscript for a novel. Despite the non-
traditional trajectory of her career and not-
straightforward, she hit a stride within the vein 
of story collections and magical, mysterious 
world building. 
She specifically hones this craft in “A Girl 
Goes into the Forest,” which features 78 
imaginative stories broken down into nine 
sections. The sections each introduce a line 
from “The Snow Queen,” a fairy tale by Hans 
Christian Andersen, a favorite of hers. 
“His fairy tale is significant to me because it’s 
one of the few in which the girl has agency — 
Gerta rescues the boy, little Kaye, whose been 
corrupted and who everyone else has given up 
on. The stories in “A Girl Goes” were written 
over a number of years and collected for their 
shared thematic investigations into the mythos 
of the American girl, nature of consciousness 
and human connections to wildernesses without 
and within,” Pursell said. The book grapples 
with the complexity of female agency and 
feminine protagonists. 
“It’s essential that female and female-
identifying writers tell our stories and share 
our perspectives, for though most readers are 
female, the largest number of authors continue 

to be male. This continues to make no sense, 
though it does reflect the reality of patriarchal 
capitalism, a system that hurts everyone, 
regardless of gender,” Pursell said. As a woman 
writing female characters into mainstream 
published literature, Pursell is aware of her 
place as a female writer and uses her status to 
tell stories about this narrative and experience. 
“The book endeavors to offer readers new ways 
for seeing the familiar American metaphoric 
landscape, in ways that I hope speak to each 
reader, in their own unique way,” Pursell said. 
It is not an easy feat to accomplish — rewriting 
and rediscovering the American landscape in a 
metaphoric and inventive way. However, Purcell 
takes on and executes this feat with a descriptive 
prose voice and stunning imagery. 
As a young woman aspiring to go into a similar 
field as Pursell and hoping to meet similar 
success, I asked her what her advice would be to 
her 20-year-old self regarding her career path. 
Her advice was poignant, and something I will 
personally remember as I begin to understand 
my desire to be a writer. 
“The most important thing I’d want any young 
self to know is there’s no one pathway, especially 
when it comes to writing and publication 
readership. It’s a twisting and turning route, 
with surprises and luck and disappointments 
to navigate. That it’s important to protect the 
writing self, especially from the publishing 
author self (two very different selves, oftentimes 
at odds), and to cultivate that solitude from 
which one writes and creates,” Pursell said.

The lawyers of “Bluff City Law” want to change 
the world. Unfortunately, their show writers are 
not as keen on making this courtroom drama pilot 
any different from its peers. 
NBC’s new fall procedural “Bluff City Law” 
follows former corporate shark Sydney Strait 
(Caitlin McGee, “Grey’s Anatomy”) as she moves 
back to her hometown of Memphis following 
the untimely death of her mother. With much 
reluctance, she accepts her father’s invitation to 
rejoin his law firm — a cozy office full of smiling and 
polite Southern stock characters — and handle civil 
cases instead of continuing to work on “the dark 
side” of large corporations. 
Sydney’s father, Elijah Strait (Jimmy Smits, 
“NYPD Blue”), in between moments of mourning 
his wife and accepting praise for being a legendary 
civil-suit lawyer, seeks to win back his daughter’s 
affections after a lifetime of cheating on her mother. 
Upon Sydney’s return to her father’s firm, she 
happily greets her supporting characters and learns 
of her next case: A high school custodian, Edgar 
Soriano, and his family claim his terminal cancer 
is the direct result of exposure to popular fertilizer 
produced by a conveniently evil conglomerate, 
Americorp.
Through some calculated grandstanding and 
some dramatic violations of courtroom and social 
etiquette, the Straits win the case, secure over 
$45 million in damages for the Soriano family and 
establish precedence for a pending class action suit 
against Americorp. Sydney and her father start to 
get along better, one of the firm’s partners has begun 
an appeal for a wrongfully convicted prisoner and 
some romantic tension is brewing between Sydney 
and her ex-husband, the chief of detectives.
On paper, “Bluff City Law” has all the components 
of a good courtroom drama. It has snappy dialogue, 
a fresh case every week, some moral introspection 
about good and evil in the American justice system. 
But in practice, the show falls flat. It’s major issue 
is its focus. The sympathetic clients exist only 
to be defended and pitied. The lawyers drive the 
emotion of the show and are the only ones shown 
suffering from corporate greed. Suffering by being 

in proximity to actual victims, of course. 
The storylines of horrific injustice simply serve 
as a backdrop to play up the rather uninteresting 
personal issues of the Straits and their partners at 
the firm. The warped focus results in a shocking 
lack of heart or emotional stakes for the audience. 
Rather than demonstrating the hard work involved 
in these cases ripped from the headlines, characters 
just talk about their already sterling reputations and 
inexplicable talents ad nauseum. Any emotional 
conflict is expressed by how tragic it would be for 
the lawyers to fail by co-opting the actual hardship 
of their clients.
Yes, the system is broken. Yes, victims of the 
system deserve justice. But focusing on beautiful 
attorneys winning sanitized, simplistic cases gives 
the wrong people attention they don’t necessarily 
deserve. For every Erin Brockovich securing a 
guilty verdict and getting a movie made about 
her, there are hundreds of people and towns that 
continue to suffer without media coverage or a 
team of Sydney Straits to break the rules and save 
the day.
The lawyers of “Bluff City Law” are good 
people. Great people, if you ask them. In fact, every 
scene of the show’s pilot episode revolves around 
the moral superiority of its main characters and 
how wonderful they are for being humanitarian 
lawyers. Yet, despite their lofty rhetoric and good 
intentions, the show’s premiere relies on tired 
courtroom drama tropes and petty personal feuds 
while failing to come through on its promise to 
“change the world.”

‘Bluff City Law’ gets off to

TV REVIEW

NBC

Humans are entitled creatures. Our superiority complexes 
prevent us from acknowledging our relationship with the natural 
world to be one of mutualism, not parasitism. Though a cynical 
thought, it seems ingrained in our psyche to take as much as 
possible with minimal reciprocation. A prime example of this 
greed is found in our treatment of bees, one of the most central 
species to sustaining our environment.
Bees embody balance, buzzing behind the scenes to maintain 
the agricultural life-cycle through pollination. Despite their 
centrality to the flow of our daily lives, society rarely witnesses 
the magic of bees, and thus fails to respect it. The sole female 
beehunter in Europe, Hatidze Muratova’s world revolves around 
bees, a dynamic that is jeopardized when a new family disturbs 
the peace in Honeyland, seeking to learn the craft of beekeeping 
under the incentive of pure profit. Though the plot revolves 
around beekeeping, at the core of the film, “Honeyland” is a much 
deeper message about greed, solitude and human connection, a 
message that pushes us all to reflect on our interactions with the 
world around us and the ways we treat one another.
A concept the film reiterates again and again is harmony. Before 
the arrival of the Sam family, Hatidze’s circle was relatively small, 
consisting of her sick mother, a few animal companions and, of 

course, her bees. Whenever she makes the long journey up to 
the beehive, it is so clear from the way that she gently lifts away 
the rockface and coaxes the bees off of the honeycomb, that her 
attitude toward the insects is one of honor and understanding. 
Among the swarms of bees, Hatidze appears at peace, unbothered 
by buzzing and fearless of stings.
With the arrival of the Sams, the atmosphere of peace and 
symmetry is instantaneously interrupted. The family is loud, 
unruly and eager to learn the ways of beekeeping, which Hatidze 
willingly teaches them. Though she enjoys the companionship that 
the Sam family brings, her tone soon changes when she realizes 
that the patriarch, Hussein Sam, has no intention of cultivating 
a give-and-take relationship with the bees. The evolution of the 
relationship between Hatidze and the family from neighborly to 
hostile is exemplified through the change in behavior of the bees. 
Under Hatidze’s care, the bees are calm and behaved, whereas 
under Hussein, they are feisty, stinging Hussein and his children 
left and right. This juxtaposition hints at the film’s larger theme 
of the bonds people form with their environments. While Hatidze 
regards the bees as companions and business partners for selling 
honey, Hussein only perceives them as temporary resources, 
meant to be used and then discarded.
Through the differing attitudes of these two characters, 
directors Tamara Kotevska and Ljubomir Stefanov prompt 
audiences to consider their own ties to the world around them. Do 
we treat the planet with respect, with an approach of reciprocation, 
or do we simply view the world as an asset, destined to be used up?

Wolverines value chance to compete, with 
exhibition against Windsor approaching

With more than 30 regular 
season games slated from fall 
to early spring, the college 
hockey season can be long and 
strenuous. 
Opportunities 
to 
pause and fine-tune during 
games are few and far between.
For the Michigan hockey 
team, there are two chances 
for 
such 
contemplation. 
Sunday’s exhibition against the 
University of Windsor marks 
the first, while the second is 
an exhibition in late January 
against the U.S. National Team 
Development Program. 
To 
the 
Wolverines, 
exhibitions matter. Sunday will 
be the team’s first contest since 
losing in the first round of the 
Big Ten Tournament nearly 
seven months ago.
“(Exhibitions give) you a 
good indication where some 
players are at,” said Michigan 

coach Mel Pearson. “You know, 
you’re just playing someone 
else and it doesn’t count in any 
of those statistics, so it’s good. 
You try some things, you work 
on some things.”
Such 
a 
baseline 
assessment can 
be quite valuable 
for a team. This 
is especially true 
for 
Michigan, 
considering the 
changes it has 
seen since last 
year 
and 
the 
questions 
that 
still must be answered. 
The Wolverines added eight 
new players to their roster — all 
of whom are seen to be viable 
options. Kris Mayotte and Matt 
Hunwick recently joined the 
program, too, as an assistant 
coach and volunteer assistant 
coach, respectively. 
Understandably, it’s not yet 

perfectly clear what role all 
the incoming players will fill. 
It’s still not even certain how 
all the returners will fit in. 
For instance, the goaltender 
position 
still 
seems 
up 
for 
grabs 
between 
sophomore 
Strauss 
Mann 
and 
senior 
Hayden Lavigne.
Thus 
an 
opportunity 
to 
try 
different 
things 
is 
beneficial. 
In 
fact, 
Pearson 
notes he wishes the team had 
more exhibitions.
Sunday’s trial run will be 
meaningful for players, such 
as senior defenseman Luke 
Martin. He injured his left arm 
last February and had to miss 
the rest of the season.
“Anytime you get to put 
on the ‘Block M’ you gotta be 

thankful for (the opportunity),” 
Martin said. “Especially after, 
you know, it’s been a long time 
coming this one. We were done 
pretty early last year, so we’re 
excited. We’ve been practicing 
for a long time, ready to get after 
somebody that’s not ourselves.”
Pearson plans on having 
a 
wide 
focus 
Sunday. 
He 
mentions his team has practiced 
pretty much all its systems and 
that he wants to see how that 
practice translates against real 
competition. 
Pearson notes that he will 
likely start the regular season 
with the same lines that play 
during the exhibition, but that 
the exhibition could make clear 
things that must be improved 
before 
the 
opening 
series 
against No. 10 Clarkson the 
following weekend.
“First and foremost you want 
to win,” Pearson said. “I mean, 
I don’t care if it’s exhibition or 
whatnot. You want to win, but 
more importantly, I think, is to 
get as many players involved in 
the game and you want to see 
them execute the things that 
we’ve been working on.”
With 
experience 
comes 
understanding. 
Entering 
his 
final year, Martin is no stranger 
to growing pains. What he 
wants 
most 
from 
Sunday’s 
exhibition 
is 
for 
his 
new 
teammates to show effort. If 
that comes, the rest will follow.
“It’ll be a little bit sloppy to 
start, I would imagine, they 
always are — you know, systems 
and everything,” Martin said. 
“Guys are going to be nervous, 
you know, first time wearing 
the jersey, everything. But it’s 
a good game to get your feet on 
the ground.
“I’m 
excited. 
We’re 
all 
getting tired of beating each 
other up everyday in practice. 
Ready to take it out on someone 
else.”

Michigan draws with Indiana, 0-0

The Michigan women’s soccer 
team (8-2-1, 3-0-1 Big Ten) tied 
Indiana, 0-0, on Sunday behind 
a strong defensive performance 
anchored by sophomore defender 
Sydney 
Shepherd 
and 
junior 
defender Alia Martin. 
“It was a tough game,” said 
Michigan coach Jennifer Klein. 
“They’re difficult to play against, 
to break down. We had 22 shots 
to their eight and we just have to 
have more production in the final 
third to give ourselves a better 
chance.”
The Wolverines got off to a 
somewhat slow start. The first few 
minutes saw some sloppy passing 
from 
Michigan 
that 
allowed 
Indiana to put together some 
attacks deep in the Wolverines’ 
defensive third. 
Though a solid performance 
from Michigan’s defense saved 
any 
damage, 
the 
Wolverines 
struggled to find rhythm in their 
attacking third. While at halftime, 

though Michigan had outshot 
the Hoosiers, nine to four, the 
score remained tied at zero. The 
Wolverines just barely controlled 
possession at 51 percent and 
spending only 19 percent of their 
possession time in their attacking 
third.
Michigan’s play cleaned up 
significantly after halftime. The 
Wolverines’ passing was much 
smoother, and they moved the 
ball well, spending more time 
in their attacking third. They 
still struggled to finish, though. 
Michigan took ten more shots in 
the second half to Indiana’s three, 
but at the end of regulation time, 
the scoreboard still showed a 0-0 
tie.
“We’re still doing a good job 
defensively,” Klein said. “Moving 
forward, going into next week, 
we need to continue to have a 
strong and aggressive attacking 
personality to give ourselves a 
chance to be better once we get in 
and around the goal.”
Both of the overtime periods 
were much of the same. Though 

Michigan put together a few 
runs in their attacking third, the 
Wolverines were still unable to 
find the back of the net.
It wasn’t as if they weren’t 
taking shots – they totaled 22 on 
the match, and they’ve had similar 
shot totals in several games this 
season. But as the sun set on 5779 
and the Jewish New Year began 
anew, Michigan still could not put 
the ball past the goal line.
The dreary weather seemed at 
times to put a damper on the pace 
of play. Rain drizzled throughout 
the match resulting in more than a 
few slips on the field. Despite this, 
both teams played a fairly physical 
match, contesting on the 50/50 
balls and staying attached to their 
marks.
“Anytime the ground is as slick 
as it is, the ball is going to slip a 
little bit,” Klein said. “I think from 
that sense, that’s really what it 
was as far as bounces. I thought 
we moved the ball really well and 
were good in possession. We just 
didn’t have enough production in 
the final third.”

Beall holds key to Michigan season

Hillary Beall came to Ann 
Arbor typifying what it means 
to be a highly-touted prospect. 
The No. 1 goalkeeper in the class 
of 2017 according to Top Drawer 
Soccer, Beall was expected to 
become an elite keeper for the 
Wolverines. After all, the shot-
stopper was a five-star prospect 
and had already accumulated an 
impressive junior international 
resume as an 18-year-old.
When prospects come with 
the kind of laundry list of 
accolades that Beall did, people 
view them as a sure thing. 
Consequently, everyone hears 
the stories of uber-talented 
busts: 
four- 
and 
five-star 
prospects that plateau, that get 
beat out by competition, that 
can’t shake the injury bug. Blue-
chip prospects don’t always pan 
out. 
Hillary Beall did.
After 
making 
a 
solid 
impression as a freshman and 
an injury-shortened sophomore 
year, Beall is proving in her 
junior year exactly why she 
earned that high ranking.
“She’s 
been 
great,” 
said 
coach Jennifer Klein. “I mean 
she’s been really solid for us. I 
think she’s done a great job as 
far as, you know, being a great 
goalkeeper and keeping the 

ball out of the back of the net 
and helping in our defensive 
organization.”
This season, Beall has started 
all 11 games and given up just 
six goals. This while putting up 
as many clean sheets — five — as 
the team recorded last season 
and not allowing more than one 
goal in any game.
“You 
can 
tell 
that 
she’s 
continuing to grow and mature,” 
Klein said.
Beall’s 
numbers prove 
her 
coach 
correct as she 
has 
made 
an 
impressive 
leap 
in 
save 
percentage from 
.756 in 2018 to 
.854 
in 
2019, 
along 
with 
a 
significant goals 
against average 
drop from 1.06 to .52.
This impressive improvement 
on already solid numbers begs 
the question: What changed?
“I went home,” Beall said. “I 
played a lot, worked a lot on my 
confidence to make sure that 
every game I’m locked in and 
here for the back line. I trained a 
lot during the summer.”
As she continues to put on 
great performance after great 
performance, including a four-
save, 110-minute clean sheet 

in Sunday’s 0-0 draw against 
Indiana, Beall’s work continues 
to show itself. The improvements 
she sought to make are plainly 
visible, as Klein recognized.
“The big thing is just the 
confidence that she has,” Klein 
said. “She’s making really good 
saves, she’s keeping us in good 
games. She’s just doing a good 
job all-around.”
Beall’s play has propelled 
Michigan to an 8-2-1 record and 
its first coaches 
poll votes since 
2017, even with 
the 
offense 
managing 
to 
score more than 
two goals only 
once thus far.
With 
the 
offense 
scoring 
1.78 
goals 
per 
game 
through 
September 26th, 
a number that ranks 101st in the 
NCAA, Beall’s exceptional play 
has been all the more important. 
She has stolen game after game 
for Michigan.
If the expectations for a five-
star prospect are to be the team’s 
X-factor, it’s pretty safe to say 
Beall has reached that level. 
Beall is the lynchpin of her team, 
and the Wolverines’ aspirations 
to end a 20 year Big Ten title 
drought draw life largely from 
her skill as a backstop.

Film breakdown: How Michigan’s first drive set tone for Gattis to follow

Of all the contrasts to draw 
between Michigan’s first three 
games and its win over Rutgers 
on Saturday, the most striking 
was also the first.
For the first three games of 
the season, the Wolverines put 
the ball on the ground on their 
first drive. And all three times, 
it foreshadowed a disappointing 
offensive performance.
Against Rutgers, Michigan 
came out firing. The Wolverines 
played mistake-free football to 
start, stuck to their guns and 
scored in five plays. Then they 
marched down the field again 
on the second drive, going up 
14-0 before 10 minutes of game 
time had passed. Call it a result 
of Josh Gattis calling plays from 
the field or a result of simply 
playing a defense as porous as 
Rutgers’. But, as the Wolverines 
worked off their script for the 
opening 
drive, 
the 
offense 
looked the way it was advertised 
for the first time all season.
The Daily dove into the tape of 
that drive to find out why.
First-and-10: 
Zach Charbonnet 6-yard run 
In the wake of last week’s loss 
at Wisconsin, we heard a lot about 
offensive identity. Specifically, 
the Wolverines wanted to run 
the ball more after throwing 
more than 40 times against the 
Badgers.
Against Rutgers, Michigan 
starts by running a counter, 
clearly with establishing the 
run in mind. But this play has 
jet motion attached, so the 
linebackers get caught going the 
wrong way. In theory, senior 
quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson 
could turn this into an option 
with receiver Ronnie Bell, the 
player in motion, as well. 
Second-and-4: Ronnie Bell 
14-yard catch
This is a slight tweak to the 
way Gattis ran things for the 

first few weeks. It’s a run-pass 
option, but instead of Patterson 
standing 
back 
in the pocket, 
the play turns 
into 
a 
naked 
bootleg, as the 
offensive 
line 
goes left while 
Patterson 
goes 
right, 
without 
any protection.
Patterson 
has 
looked 
uncomfortable 
running RPOs with dropbacks 
attached. Rarely had he gotten 
to break the pocket and throw 
on the move, an area in which 

he excelled in 2018. Here, Gattis 
puts Patterson in a position to 
do that without 
compromising 
his 
own 
philosophy.
First-and-10: 
Christian 
Turner 2-yard 
run
Gattis 
keeps 
it basic on first 
down again, this 
time with a pin-
and-pull. 
Like 
the first run of the game, it 
seems to have an RPO attached 
with 
Bell, 
but 
Patterson 
hands the ball off and Rutgers 

linebacker Avery Young makes a 
nice play on the stop.
Second-
and-8: Christian 
Turner 10-yard 
run
This is the first 
run of the game 
that 
appears 
to be a straight 
give, 
with 
no 
read of any kind 
attached. It’s just 
inside zone, hat 
on a hat — the 
kind of thing Michigan excelled 
at doing last season, which is 
apparent here.
The 
line 
moves 
people, 

Turner hits the hole and it goes 
for a considerable gain. This is 
just as you draw 
it up.
First-
and-10: 
Nico 
Collins 
touchdown, 
48-yard catch
There’s 
nothing 
complicated 
going on here, 
and 
that’s 
the 
beauty 
of it. Collins is matched up 
against a smaller, less athletic 
cornerback. Gattis isolates him 
with a flat route while freshman 

tight end Erick All runs the 
other way. It’s what everyone 
clamored for Collins to get — a 
chance to win a 1-on-1 matchup 
with his physical ability.
And 
he 
does 
just 
that, 
getting initial separation on 
the route, then runs right by 
the defensive back and has a 
clear path to the end zone.
Gattis’ problem for the first 
three weeks of the year was 
that he couldn’t find a way to 
imprint his philosophy onto 
Michigan’s 
personnel. 
For 
all the talk about identity, all 
you had to do to see what the 
Wolverines wanted to be was 
go on Twitter at any point in 
the last six months. Actually 
doing it in a game, though, is 
a different matter altogether.
On Saturday, from the first 
play, Gattis seemed to have it 
figured out.
That all comes with the 
asterisk that it was against 
Rutgers. But the emphasis 
on 
getting 
Patterson 
out 
of the pocket was obvious 
throughout. So was using their 
best receivers in the passing 
game. 
Collins, 
Donovan 
Peoples-Jones and Tarik Black 
were noticeably more involved. 
More than that, Gattis put 
them in positions to use their 
physical skill, like that throw 
to Collins, or a fade to Peoples-
Jones on the next drive.
The first drive set a tone 
that went on for the rest of 
the game — Gattis’ ideology 
tailored to this roster. It’s no 
coincidence 
that 
Michigan 
scored 52 points once the 
coaching staff started to think 
about how those two elements 
could work in tandem instead 
of forcing one on the other.
Whether 
the 
Wolverines 
can replicate it against Iowa 
or Penn State is another story. 
But for now, they at least know 
what the plans should look 
like.

ETHAN SEARS
Managing Sports Editor

RUCHITA IYER/Daily
Senior quarterback Shea Patterson displayed his ability to make a bevy of different throws and rushes, scoring four total touchdowns in a 52-0 win over Rutgers.

The first drive 
set a tome that 
went on for 
the... game.

Against 
Rutgers, 
Michigan came

Nico 
Collins 
leaned 
back 
against the ledge at Schembechler 
Hall and smiled. His semi-
sarcastic laugh didn’t nullify the 
validity of his answer, though.
“I’m always open,” he joked, 
before the next question came 
flying in.
It’s a phrase many players 
say, with varying degrees of 
seriousness. But it’s easy to get 
the sense that the 6-foot-4 Collins 
believes it.
“I feel like as a receiving 
corps, 
we’re 
always 
open,” 
Collins reiterated. “I believe in 
our guys, and Shea believes in 
us. And I believe he can give us 
opportunities to go make a play.”
Collins’ answer, though basic, 
stripped down the essence of a 
potentially potent passing attack 
to its bare bones. It underscored 
the 
optimism 
that 
was 
so 
pervasive around this unit before 
the season, and even offered a hint 
of what Collins and others believe 
could still be coming.
Collins himself posted 632 
yards and six touchdowns in 2018, 
seemingly a sign of an impending 
breakout year before a legitimate 
NFL 
decision 
would 
arrive. 
Then Michigan hired offensive 
coordinator Josh Gattis, who 
brought a history of producing 
current and future NFL talent, 
like Chris Godwin, DaeSean 
Hamilton, Jerry Jeudy and Jordan 
Matthews, among others.
He brought a concept of “speed 
in space”, which was quite an 
appealing vision. Put your best 
players in the best position to 
make plays. 
By any measure, Collins is one 
of Michigan’s best players. And by 
those same objective measures, 
his 10 catches though four games 
tell the tale of scant usage in what 
was supposed to be a defining 
year.
In the Wolverines 35-14 loss 
at Wisconsin, Collins was among 
those who outwardly displayed 
signs of frustrated On one 
particular route in the fourth 
quarter, Collins’ cornerback fell 
down mere yards past the line of 
scrimmage. Collins, hand raised, 

watched with the entire crowd as 
Patterson’s pass sailed well over 
the intended receiver, draped in 
double-coverage. 
“We were losing — there’s 
always going to be frustration 
when you lose,” Collins said. “Not 
really, it was just open, it’s alright, 
it is what it is, next play. I’m not 
going to hold a grudge. There were 
times I was open, but I know Shea 
is going to find me next time.”
Late in that game, Collins 
started to become more involved. 
On one drive in the fourth quarter, 
he caught three targets for 79 
yards, though one of the catches 
was nullified for pass interference. 
Still, the downfield sequence left 
fans wondering where that was 
two hours prior.
That loss led to a week of 
introspection, both with the 
receiving corps and with the 
offense writ large. Collins said 
the group honed its emphasis 
on attention to detail, which 
translated to a clean 52-0 win 
against Rutgers. The win included 
a 48-yard touchdown for Collins, 
who caught a seven-yard out 
route, turned upfield and sprinted 
down the sideline for the score. 
It looked easy. Speed met space. 
Almost as though finding your 
best players is both simple and 
smart.
Still, Gattis has been adamant 
that this offense, at its best, does 

not force-feed anybody. When 
it’s 
humming, 
everyone 
and 
everything will be an option, he 
emphasized.
“We talk about being balanced; 
balance for us is not run or pass,” 
Gattis said. “Balance is how many 
guys touch the ball. We want to 
be balanced from that standpoint; 
that the ball is being distributed 
to all of our playmakers and all of 
our skill guys.”
But when a player of Collins’ 
caliber only has 10 catches, there 
is a reasonable question as to 
whether everything has been 
over-thought. Collins and juniors 
Donovan Peoples-Jones and Tarik 
Black are among the three best 
weapons — if not the three best — 
this team has. 
To not use them repeatedly, 
particularly 
amid 
offensive 
troubles, would be to self-restrict 
this group’s ceiling.
Asked where this offense can 
still go, Collins started down a 
laundry list.
“Trusting the play-calling,” 
he said. “Receivers working on 
our details. Watching film from 
Wisconsin, what can we do 
better? We can always improve 
as a receiving corps, and Shea can 
always improve as a quarterback. 
We can always improve.”
What 
wasn’t 
said, 
though 
seemingly implied: He’s always 
open.

Christian Turner staying level 
after first career touchdown

Ten months removed from the 
hype of the Peach Bowl, in front of 
an emptying stadium as a blowout 
took hold, Christian Turner finally 
scored.
He emerged from the pile, a 
grin visible from inside his helmet 
and briefly celebrated before 
jogging back to the sideline as 
Michigan’s lead over Rutgers grew 
to 31. He didn’t want to bask in it. 
Still doesn’t. “Don’t want to make 
that some spectacular moment I 
think about for the rest of my life,” 
Turner said Tuesday evening.
Turner, a sophomore running 
back, has already experienced the 
fleeting nature of these things. In 
Michigan football’s ecosystem — a 
fan base yearning for the next hit of 
serotonin and a roster constantly 
churned by competition — hype 
doesn’t last long. High praise 
about practice performance is met 
with wariness until anybody sees 
it in a game.
In the run-up to last year’s 
Peach Bowl, Turner was the 
subject of that spotlight. He heard 
it from Jim Harbaugh, from his 
fellow running backs, from the 
rest of the offense. “He’s been 
tearing it up all Christmas camp,” 
Jon Runyan Jr. said in the days 
before, echoing general sentiment.
In the game, for a brief moment 
before everything fell apart, he 
delivered on it, darting across 
the formation, taking a handoff, 
cutting 
upfield, 
hugging 
the 
boundary, going into the end zone 
untouched. Then the touchdown 
got called back on a penalty, and 
Turner finished the game with 
32 yards — less than he would 
have gotten on that play alone had 
it stood. As spring approached, 
conversation turned to a new 
offense and a new running back, 
Zach Charbonnet. It stayed there 
this fall, as Charbonnet racked up 
48 carries, even as Turner notched 
more touches in four weeks (34) 
than the 21 he did all of last season.
On Tuesday, Turner was put 
in front of the media and gave 
a rush of cliches in a low voice. 

Buried underneath them, a quiet 
confidence simmered.
“It took some pressure off,” 
Turner said of his touchdown. 
“I finally got to the end zone, but 
now I just want to get comfortable 
scoring. I don’t want to just get 
complacent.”
Turner said his pass protection 
is still developing, a lingering 
product of the 
transition 
to 
college. 
He 
stressed that he 
didn’t get down 
last year when 
he sat nor when 
he got hurt. He’s 
staying 
level 
now, too, as the 
Wolverines try to 
develop a more 
steady 
rotation 
of carries. All the right things.
In 
high 
school, 
Turner’s 
coach stressed the importance of 
keeping things steady. Turner was 
splitting carries with Anthony 
Grant, now a sophomore at Florida 
State, and Derrian Brown, a Texas 
signee in the 2019 class. They 
had a great backfield, but Turner 
played a lot less than most three-
star recruits who get high-major 
offers. He kept his coach’s advice 
in mind last year. It’s not far from 
his mind now, either.
“You can’t control everything 
that’s gonna happen to you in your 

life, but you can control how you 
react to it and how you respond 
to it,” Turner said. “That’s the R 
factor.”
Still, when he got to Michigan, 
Turner got caught trying to run 
straight forward. Asked Tuesday 
about what he carried into this 
year from those bowl practices 
in December, Turner mentioned 
complacency 
twice. 
“Or 
just 
thinking 
I’m 
already 
there 
when 
I 
hadn’t 
really 
done 
anything yet,” he 
said.
To be clear, he 
knew there would 
be 
a 
learning 
curve, and still 
acknowledges 
that there’s aways to go. Last 
year, Karan Higdon told him to 
be patient. Turner brought it up 
in the context of running the ball 
and waiting for a hole to open up. 
It was hard not to see a bigger 
picture coming into focus.
“I was just trying to outrun 
everybody,” Turner said. “He was 
the one that told me, if you keep 
trying to do that, you’re gonna 
get hit pretty hard.”
On Saturday, instead of going 
down when he got hit, Turner 
moved the pile and crossed the 
ball over the plane.

Sleeping in the cell


F

resh off the plane back from my study abroad 
experience in Paris, and standing in front of the 
mirror in my mother’s bathroom, I took a pair of 
kitchen scissors and haphazardly cut a fringe, framing 
the front of my forehead. The bangs were uneven, a 
little too thick on the right side of my forehead, and very 
clearly an amateur job — but they immediately made me 
feel transformed, like a new woman.
When my mom saw my handiwork later that evening, 
her knee jerk response was, “Oh god, Meghann, what 
have you done?” My friends had a similar response (I’d 
consulted with very few people prior to my decision). In 
general, the theme seemed to be one of cautious support 
with a wary undertone of, “Are you sure you’re OK?” I 
reassured them that I was, in fact, doing well, and that 
the bangs were a conscious fashion decision and not 
the product of a mental breakdown — perhaps trying to 
convince myself as much as them.
I didn’t think it would take much convincing because, 
for the most part, I felt like I was doing well. I returned 
from Paris feeling more confident, independent and 
solid in my identity. This was a year of change and new 
experiences, and I was going to embrace it fully — hair 
and all. Cutting my bangs was another exciting change in 
an era of my life where things seemed to be constantly in 
flux, and I was completely OK with that. 
This was the dominant narrative I was telling myself. 
There was one big “but” to this, however — I didn’t have 
a summer internship lined up. That was something I was 
enormously insecure about, and perhaps the anxiety 
surrounding that aspect of my life manifested itself into 
enough liquid courage to pick up the kitchen scissors.
Bangs on women tend to fall into one of two categories: 
5-year-olds on their first day of kindergarten or “artsy 
girls” with film cameras and Monet paintings on their 
walls. I’d flirted with the “artsy girl” identity before 
(having both a film camera and Monet prints on my dorm 
wall), but was wary to commit to it. 
As a high school senior, I was deciding between the 
University of Michigan and University of California-
Berkeley. One of the appeals of the University of 
Michigan was how many different types of people I 
would be surrounded with. But being from California 
meant Berkeley was the easier option. It was in-state, I 
would know people there, and I’d spent a fair amount of 
time in Berkeley. 
I also felt that everyone that went to Berkeley was the 
same in a familiar way — “artsy” political activists who 
cared about the environment and were vegetarian. I was 
afraid it would be too easy for me to fall into that identity 
without really trying to be different, without actively 
surrounding myself with people who didn’t come from a 
liberal Californian town.
So I came to Michigan, and I surrounded myself 
with new people. Freshman year, I definitely made 
some friends that were familiar artsy political activist 

types, but also spent a fair amount 
of time in circles that were more 
“mainstream”— and tried to make 
myself as palatable as possible to as 
wide a range of people as I could. I 
dressed relatively unobtrusively, I 
tailgated for every game day, I went to 
frat parties on Friday nights. 
And it was great — I felt like I was 
getting the full “college experience.” 
It was also completely necessary, I 
think, for me to try different things 
and throw myself into that scene. The 
thing that I eventually began to come 
to terms with over the next few years, 
however, was that I wasn’t always 
being quite myself in these situations. 
I was trying to be neutral, to be 
whatever and whoever was expected 
of me in any given setting — whether 
that was the (pseudo) sorority girl 
who wore bedsheets to themed 
toga parties, or the political science 
student who wouldn’t shut up about 
John Locke. I wasn’t necessarily being 
untrue to myself. I was just trying, 
really hard, to be the stereotype of a 
million different things at once. 
So, I cut my bangs. I figured that if I 
was going to live a life of stereotypes, 
I might as well pick one and run all 
the way with it. And while the new 
haircut was in part maybe just a 
manifestation of a need for change, it 
also simultaneously symbolized me 
letting go of the Meghann who would 
try to blend into every social group.
I am a stereotypically artsy liberal 
political activist girl from California 
who now lives in Kerrytown, and I 
am fully ready to embrace that aesthetic 
in the most obnoxious, cliché way possible. Cutting the 
bangs also gave me courage in the way haircuts tend to 
do. The bangs made me feel new and shiny, and view 
myself in a different light. I felt more confident in my own 
skin than I had in a long time, and the feeling lasted. 
My bangs and I have been together for almost four 
months now, and we’re doing great. 
It might just seem like a haircut — and it totally is just a 
haircut. I still look more or less like the same person I did 
a few years ago. Even my own father, who is notoriously 
unobservant about these things, didn’t notice my bangs 
until I pointed them out to him an hour into our dinner. 
I’m well aware that there are much more dramatic 
changes people can make to their lifestyle — yet, bangs 
still feel like they hold a special spot as a tried and true 

classic of self-reinvention. 
Bangs tend to get a bad rap as a product of mental 
breakdowns and low periods of someone’s life. This 
narrative, however, overlooks the reality that changing 
one’s personal appearance (even if it’s through bangs) can 
be immensely cathartic — changing the filter through 
which the world perceives you is so empowering and in 
my case, made me feel more like myself than I had in a 
long while. And I did eventually find an internship that 
summer. Which probably can’t be entirely attributed to 
the bangs, but I’d like to think that they get at least some 
credit. Or at least some credit goes to the confidence and 
subsequent wave of motivation they gave me.
So if you’re considering bangs, my advice is to just 
do the damn thing. Just maybe invest in some sharper 
scissors than your mother’s kitchen pair.

In defense of bangs

I 

remember the exact moment in sixth grade when I 
realized an essay didn’t need to be five paragraphs: 
Intro, body, body, body and conclusion. It didn’t 
need to have topic sentences and transitions. I was always 
taught an essay should be concise and clean. It must be 
easy on the eye and straightforward — beautiful, even. 
Those were the rules, but I remember when I realized 
I was allowed to break them. I think this was one of the 
moments that made me want to be a writer. I understood 
how wonderful it is to write freely; how hallowed is a page 
of words that breaks the rules, how terrifying and how 
lovely. 
Granted, I’m the copy chief at The Michigan Daily and I 
spend six hours a night making sure each piece that comes 
in adheres to our rules. I double check names and triple 
check facts; truth is a rule of journalism we don’t break. 
Truth is not easy on the eye, and it’s not always beautiful. 
Like the rain, we can wish it away and it comes anyway. 
Without warning, it removes that final layer of dust, part-
ing those last clouds in the sky. Sometimes, the sun shines 
through. 
I try really hard to do my job right. Ask me a question 
about grammar, and 
I’ll know the answer. I know 
the name of every 
city councilmember. I 
know the way each 
reporter writes. I 
know 
the cadence of 
the 
newsroom. I 
try to make 

sure what we publish is truthful, that we’re answering 
the questions correctly. But I’m still looking for my own 
answers, learning how to write the truth for myself. If 
you’re reading this, I’ve probably lied to you. I’ve probably 
told you I was okay when I wasn’t. I’ve probably said I’ll 
be there soon, and never came. But who hasn’t? What are 
the rules of telling our own truth? When do we know when 
we’re holding too much back, or taking it too far?
You want my truth?
I’ll confess: I spend Monday night playing with words, 
but can’t push past “Hey, how are you?” on Tuesday night 
at the bar. Sometimes I still skip meals. I chew an entire 
pack of gum a day. Am I really a writer if these are the first 
words I’ve put on a page in months? I’m recovering from 
an eating disorder — what do I know about breaking the 
rules? What do I know about living the truth?
Is it as simple as just being myself? What is simple about 
breaking our own rules, about ignoring the command-
ments we’ve laid out for ourselves? Don’t eat until you have 
to, always say, “No, thank you.” Don’t ask for help. Don’t 
take up too much space. Intro, body, body, body and con-
clusion. Do you know how hard it was to eat when I was 
hungry? Do you know how hard it was to fill a blank page 
with words? 
Here’s my real topic sentence: Let’s break all the rules 
and put them back together again. Every time I correct 
your grammar, what I mean is thank you for your truth. 
When I leave a note in your article, what I mean is that I 

hear you. Journalism is about truth. Healing is about truth. 
Topic sentence. … Transition. Loving yourself through 
the rain is so hard. I’m tired of not talking about the hard 
stuff. Am I allowed to write in metaphors? I can’t breathe 
when I look at pictures of myself from a year ago. When I 
ask you if you’re okay, you can tell me the truth. I’m telling 
you to write as many paragraphs as you want. I’m telling 
you to speak your truth. I’ll be there to break the rules with 
you. I’ll be there to fix your commas and let you scream at 
the top of your lungs. 
I’m going to remind you to eat. I’m going to remind you 
you’re a writer. Say, “Yes, thank you.”
I love what I do at The Daily.
I’ll confess: sometimes I complain to my friends, some-
times the work is so tedious and my name is so small in the 
fine print. They’ll tell you no one reads the newspaper just 
like they’ll tell you that skinny means beautiful. They’ll tell 
you to skip the metaphors and just get to the point. Stop 
writing about yourself; stop writing. These are the rules 
I’m happy to break. 
If I’ve learned anything at all — from being sick, from 
healing, from copy editing, from writing, from sixth grade 
— it is this: Make your own rules and break them.
How terrifying and lovely it is to tell the truth now. How 
beautiful, even.

S

eymour’s last meal had been overcooked, 
which, at least to him, ruined what 
should’ve been a perfectly civilized 
execution. There was no reason for it not to be 
civilized, after all. He had confessed right out to 
those “despicable acts of human indecency” of 
which he was accused. No sense in lying about it, 
anyway. He was unsure whether it was delusion, 
hellish rage, or straight up boredom that drove 
someone to murder, but whatever it was he had 
quickly figured out that people can smell it on 
you. And so, he offered little protest to anything 
brought up in court, with the exception, of 
course, of when his lawyer — his own lawyer! — 
had claimed that Seymour himself was insane. 
Honestly, how rude must a person be to insult a 
man on his way to death row like that? Even the 
decision to put him to death had elicited no such 
objection from Seymour. He knew he deserved to 
die; at least, in an objective sense. As he lay down 
in his small, rectangular cell, he thought about 
this and about how there was no reason for this 
transaction to be anything less than pleasant. 
However, after enduring the blatant disrespect 
with which the prison chefs had handled his 
meatloaf, all courteousness on his end was out 
the window. Now he was determined to raise as 
much hell as possible on his way down there.
He stared into the small TV buzzing in the 
corner of the death watch cell. It was one of three 
luxuries that Seymour was offered to indulge in 
for his remaining hours on earth. The other two 
were listening to a radio or reading, both of which 
he would’ve traded in for an earlier sentence 
without hesitation. The TV was alright — the 
reception was bad, but he was watching a weather 
report about the massive snowstorm set to hit 
early tomorrow morning, and how it was likely 
that many people would lose power. He would’ve 
laughed at the poor bastards, but he caught 
himself when he remembered the three guards 
who were watching him through the two-way 
mirror at his back. He loathed that he was being 
observed, and had actually protested to it when 
the idea was first brought up. It seemed to him 
a form of cruel and unusual punishment to take 
a man whose utter hatred of people had driven 

him to murder quite a few of them and then force 
that man to spend his final hours surrounded by 
a bunch of strangers. He could almost hear the 
guards on the other side of the glass — one of 
them had made a snide comment over his sub-
par meatloaf, expressing relief that he “hadn’t 
asked for people-meat instead.” That was just 
childish, honestly, and very disrespectful. As if 
just because he was a murderer, all his standards 
went right in the shitter. He had half a mind to 
inform the guard that he probably had a more 
refined taste in meat than she did, but he kept his 
mouth shut. After his meal, he wished he hadn’t.
The worst of all, however, must’ve been the 
priest; a thin, nasally man who came into the 
chamber around nineish to ask Seymour all sorts 
of questions about Jesus and hell and people-
meat and the Bible. God, Seymour thought he’d 
never shut up. It took a threat to “personally waltz 
up to heaven and castrate St. Peter” to convince 
the priest that Seymour wasn’t interested. He 
was far more concerned with the few hours of 
rest that he were permitted from 6 p.m. to 11:30 
p.m., when they would start going about the 
myriad of “preparations” that apparently had to 
be done. He looked to the bottom corner of the 
TV screen for the time. He couldn’t make out the 
last number, but it was 11:20-something. With a 
sigh, he repositioned himself and wondered, for 
his last few minutes of pseudo-solitude, whether 
that time the priest had stolen from him really 
made that much of a difference. He concluded, 
just before one of the guards came in, that it really 
didn’t, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t be upset 
about it. It was a matter of principle, y’know?
The guard laid out a new pair of denim jeans 
and a blue collared shirt on the bed before 
giving him a few minutes to change. He stripped 
himself of his jumpsuit and dressed himself for 
execution. The jeans, he reluctantly admitted, 
were comfortable, though he wished he didn’t 
have to wear so much blue all at once. Talk about 
tacky. It was ironic, he thought, how many times 
he had expressed distaste in an outfit by saying 
he “wouldn’t be caught dead in that.” He made 
a mental note to mention to one of the guards 
that they should probably stop using that phrase 

as well, on the off chance they end up in his 
situation.
At about midnight, the three guards entered 
the cell and escorted Seymour to the execution 
chamber. It was even smaller, with a big gurney 
— to which he was probably supposed to be 
strapped — taking up most of the cell, and the 
entire room was a gaudy lime green color that 
didn’t much compliment all his blue at all. He 
peered into the two-way mirror on one of the 
walls, beyond which he guessed about 50 people 
were seated to watch him die. He laughed at the 
irony. After all, wanting to watch people die was 
most likely what got him in this situation. Had 
he known there were free showings down here, 
maybe things would’ve turned out differently.
The guards laid him down in his chair and 
spent about five minutes strapping his arms 
and legs down, which Seymour thought was 
perfectly purposeless. Coming from someone 
who knew very well how to murder a person, 
they weren’t doing too great. He’d never heard 
complaints from his victims, and they’d certainly 
never been bored about it. It had always been a 
quick, clean, easy ordeal. After securing him, 
the guards left and the medic came in to insert 
the needles into his forearms. There were two of 
them, complete with long transparent tubes that 
coiled their way back behind him and into the 
wall, from where, Seymour assumed, the death 
would be coming. The first needle, inserted with 
an entirely pointless swab of rubbing alcohol, was 
quick and easy, but the medic had a little trouble 
locating the vein on Seymour’s right arm. After 
about eight minutes of searching accompanied by 
Seymour’s demands to “see your medical license 
to make sure you don’t accidentally kill me,” 
the needle was inserted and the medic went to 
work wiring him up to a heart monitor. After he 
finished, he scuttled out of the room. Seymour 
counted to a hundred before the warden came in, 
wearing a black suit and tie instead of his usual 
pompous uniform. He then stood a few feet away 
from Seymour, his arms crossed behind his back 
to make sure everyone knew just how highly he 
thought of himself, and looked him over.
“Do you have any last words?” the warden 

asked.
Seymour thought for a few seconds before 
replying.
“You should really let me live so I can teach 
you how to properly kill someone,” he said. “The 
system you have in place here isn’t very efficient 
at all. If I were in charge, I could’ve had this 
whole bitch finished before lunch.”
The warden grimaced and shook his head.
“May God have mercy on your soul,” he said.
The warden then turned and exited the room, 
shutting the door behind him and leaving 
Seymour, apart from his invisible spectators, 
alone at last. He laid back in his chair and let the 
fluorescent lights wash over his closed eyelids, 
indulging in the silence. For the first time in 
many years, he felt comfortable — completely 
separated from all these people whom he had 
grown to hate so sincerely, freed from all worries 
of the future and ready to embrace whatever 
isolation death had in store for him. With a smile 
on his face, Seymour fell asleep.
Seymour’s sleeping was, of course, not of his 
own volition. It was the result of the five grams 
of sodium pentothal, a barbiturate that had, at 
the touch of a small plunger, run from the back 
room through the intravenous lines connected 
to Seymour’s forearms and, finally, into his 
bloodstream, to make him lose consciousness in 
less than 30 seconds. This alone would almost 
always kill a person, just as any overdose of 
opioids would. However, over the following 
five minutes or so, the lines were flushed with a 
saline solution, and a second plunger was pushed. 
This one injected 50cc of pancuronium bromide, 
a neuromuscular blocking agent that relaxes 
the skeletal striated muscles during tracheal 
intubation and surgery. In this case, it was 
being used to paralyze Seymour’s respiratory 
system. Then, in an act of security which would 
have elicited from Seymour an endless tirade of 
ridicule, the lines were flushed again and, with 
the press of a third plunger, filled with 50cc of 
potassium chloride, which would stimulate 
cardiac arrhythmia and, eventually, stop his 
heart.

VISUAL STATEMENT

BIOLOGICAL STATION

I SPENT MY SUMMER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN 

BIOLOGICAL STATION BOTH AS A STUDENT AND AN INTERN. MY 

TIME WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN MY GENERAL ECOLOGY CLASS 

AND MY JOB AS A MEDIA AND COMMUNICATIONS INTERN, 

WHERE MY MAIN ROLE WAS TAKING PHOTOS. IT WAS A COMBI-

NATION OF TWO OF MY FAVORITE THINGS, NATURE AND PHO-

TOGRAPHY. IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT ALLOWED ME TO BE 

CREATIVE, LEARN MORE ABOUT ECOLOGY AND PHOTOGRAPHY 

AND MAKE LIFE LONG FRIENDSHIPS.
