University hosts 

30th annual 
campus-wide 
symposium

By BRANDON SUMMERS-

MILLER

Daily Staff Reporter

The University hosted a 

series of events across campus 
for the annual Martin Luther 
King 
Jr. 
Day 
symposium 

Monday to honor the life and 
social 
activism 
of 
Martin 

Luther King Jr. Monday. In its 
30th year, the 2015 symposium 
was titled “#WhoWillBeNext,” 
and focused on addressing 
modern day racism, generating 
proactive social attitudes and 
encouraging racial inclusion.

The symposium featured 

a variety of events outside of 
the annual keynote memorial 
speech in Hill Auditorium, 
including the annual Youth Day, 
campus-wide watch parties, 
the Circle of Unity, West Quad’s 
Connector Forum and the Law 
School’s symposium event titled 
“#YourLifeMatters.” While the 
events were unique in what 
they offered their audiences, 
each 
posed 
questions 
of 

modern incarnations of racism 
and shared sentiments of social 
justice, collective responsibility 
and community awareness.

Beginning Monday’s events 

was the 18th Annual Children 
and Youth Day, hosted by 
the University of Michigan 
School of Education as a part 
of the Martin Luther King Jr. 
Symposium.

In 
an 
interview, 
Molly 

Green, a graduate student in 
the School of Public Health 
and an event organizer, said the 
event aims to educate about the 
legacy of Martin Luther King 
Jr.

“This is a day of service 

and to come together as a 
community,” Green said. “It’s 
a chance to think more about 
civil rights and equality.”

Throughout the day, local 

youth 
from 
schools 
and 

churches in the Washtenaw 
County area participated in 
small group activities and 
workshops, such as musical 
chairs to teach inclusion and 
fairness, civil rights poetry 
readings, 
open 
discussions 

about equality and justice and 
a viewing of King’s “I Have a 
Dream” speech.

The event included remarks 

from 
Elizabeth 
James, 

program 
assistant 
for 
the 

Department of Afroamerican 
and African Studies, as well 
as performances from the 
Detroit School of Arts’ Ladies 
Achievers Ensemble, Detroit’s 
Reverend Jones, acapella group 
58 Greene and more.

I will be completely 

honest in saying that 
this is one of the hardest 
things I’ve had to write 
— mainly because I know 
that, as my mother, you 
are my biggest supporter 
and encourager. I can 
always count on you to 
be my number one fan 
— except when it comes 
to my natural curls. 
From the age of 10, I can 
remember only negative 
comments 
from 
you 

when I tried to wear my 

hair in its natural state — 
without any chemicals, 
heat or manipulation.

I 
admire 
your 

simplicity when it comes 
to beauty, which is why I 
wonder why there seems 
to be so much distaste 
toward 
my 
natural 

hair. But as I’ve grown 
to recognize that the 
negativity surrounding 
Black 
women 
and 

natural hair has to do 
with race and many 
underlying 
historical 

reasons, I have gained 
a better understanding 
of the inherent racism 
that drives us as Black 

women to desire the 
universal standard of 
beauty — which is that of 
the European aesthetic. 
I wonder, though, if 
you understand that? I 
wonder if you understand 
the underlying teachings 
of self-hate toward our 
own race that have been 
inflicted on both you and 
me growing up. Because 
this is what America 
teaches us — that we 
must conform to the 
ideal image of the white 
race or else we are not 
considered “beautiful.”

At Hill Auditorium, 
activist challenges 
audience to become 

involved

By ALYSSA BRANODN and

Daily News Editor and Daily Staff 

Reporter

Nontombi Naomi Tutu, South 

African race and gender activist 
and daughter of archbishop 
Desmond Tutu, joined the ranks 
of renowned social activists who 
have delivered the University’s 
annual Martin Luther King Jr. 
Symposium keynote memorial 
lecture 
Monday 
afternoon. 

Addressing a packed audience at 
Hill Auditorium, Tutu charged 
the audience to hold themselves 
individually 
responsible 
for 

taking 
action 
against 
the 

injustices they see in the world. 

The 30th annual Martin 

Luther King Jr. symposium, 
which featured multiple events 
across 
campus 
including 

Tutu’s keynote address, aimed 
to 
engage 
the 
University 

community in dialogues about 
King’s legacy. This year’s theme 
is 
#WhoWillBeNext, 
which 

seeks to prompt the campus 

community to consider both 
who will fall victim to and who 
will lead the escape from hatred 
in the world, according to the 
sympoisum’s website. 

For Tutu however, this theme 

was problematic. She began 
her remarks by challenging the 
University’s theme, criticizing 
the theme for highlighting the 
negative associated with Martin 
Luther King Jr. She said she was 
told by the University the theme 
would be in the context of both 
“who would be the next to 
lead?” in addition to “who would 
be the next to suffer the injustice 
of racism by being killed?”

Tutu said she prefers to focus 

on the positive potential of the 
future, 
instead 
encouraging 

audience members to take a 
more proactive approach to 
injustice, challenging them to 
consider themselves the next 
generation of social activist 
leaders. 

“Maybe what we should be 

saying is ‘We are all next, and we 
refuse to allow anyone else to be 
next,” Tutu said.

Veering from praising only 

Martin Luther King Jr., she 
emphasized instead that like 
all great leaders, King was no 
different from any person sitting 
in the audience.

Students and 
faculty reflect 

on legacy of local 

activist

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily News Editor

At the School of Social Work 

Building 
Monday 
afternoon, 

more than 100 students and 
faculty convene to discuss one 
of the most influential activists 
of the 20th century, Grace Lee 
Boggs.

Boggs, who died last year, was 

an activist, writer and speaker 
with seven decades of experience 
advocating for civil and women’s 
rights. The event was part of the 
University’s Martin Luther King 
Jr. symposium.

Stephen 
Ward, 
professor 

of Afroamerican and African 
Studies, 
is 
writing 
a 
dual 

biography of Boggs and her 
husband James, titled “In Love 
and Struggle: The Revolutionary 
Lives of James and Grace Lee 
Boggs,” is a board member of 
the James and Grace Lee Boggs 
Center to Nurture Community 

Leadership 
and 
helped 
to 

organize the event.

Ward said the language used 

to 
describe 
Boggs’ 
activism 

doesn’t give a full picture of her 
work because she doesn’t fit into 
traditional classifications of an 
activist.

“In some ways most of those 

are only partially accurate, or 
there’s some ambiguity there,” 
Ward said. “Grace doesn’t seem to 
fit our own categories.”

In particular, Ward said an 

Asian American woman was 
anomalous in the civil rights 
movement when Boggs began 
her work, and it would be more 
fitting to refer to her as a human 
rights activist. He said those who 
call Boggs a revolutionary would 
hit closer to the truth, but are no 
closer to identifying her.

“I think in the use of ‘civil 

rights’ 
we 
sometimes 
lazily 

use to describe Black people or 
other types of struggles without 
properly recognizing what it 
takes to make a movement,” Ward 
said.

State residents hold 
governer responsible 
for Flint water crisis

By MARLEE BREAKSTONE

Daily Staff Reporter

A group of Michigan residents 

from across the state gathered in 

Ann Arbor on Monday to call for 

the arrest of Gov. Rick Snyder, one 

of wave of Monday protests held 

in past weeks over the Flint water 

crisis. 

In April 2014, the state of 

Michigan decided to temporarily 

switch the supply of Flint’s water 

from Lake Uron to the Flint River 

as a way to save money. However, 

lead from the service lines in 

Flint began to leak into the water 

supply. As a result of the switch, 

researchers warned city and state 

officials of the toxic lead in the 

water, when the city changed 

the water source in October 2015 

— 18 months later — and Snyder 

declared a state of emergency on 

Jan. 5.

President 
Barack 
Obama 

also issued a federal emergency 

declaration in response to the 

Flint 
water 
crisis 
Saturday, 

allocating $5 million in federal 

aid to immediately assist the city. 

Several democratic canidates for 

president highlighted Flint during 

Sunday night’s debate, calling the 

situation deplorable. 

Novi resident Colleen Crossey, 

alum of the University School of 

Social Work and co-organizer 

of the protest, said she chose to 

hold the march on Martin Luther 

King Jr. Day to coincide with the 

University’s annual symposium 

aimed at highlighting modern-day 

social justice.

“Many of the speakers on 

this day will encourage their 

audience members to organize 

and 
fight 
back 
against 
the 

unethical activities that oppress 

others,” Crossey said. “This rally 

and march will give them the 

opportunity to do just that.”

ADEA associate 
director Jeanne 
Sinkford gives 
annual address 

By NICOLE SKEHAN

For the Daily

While other Martin Luther 

King Jr. memorial lectures on 
campus charged students to ponder 
#WhoWillBeNext in sparking social 
activism, the Joint Health Schools 
MLK 
Symposium 
Committee 

lecture Monday asked who would 
be next specifically in increasing 
diversity in health care systems. 
Jeanne 
C. 
Sinkford, 
associate 

executive director of the American 
Dental Education Association and 
director of the Association’s Center 
for Equity and Diversity, delivered 
the annual health sciences lecture 
at Dow Auditorium in the Towsley 
Center.

Sinkford 
is 
nationally 
and 

internationally renowned as a dental 
educator, administrator, researcher 
and clinician, and served as the 
first woman dean of a dental school 
at Howard University College of 
Dentistry from 1975 to 1991.

She opened her lecture by 

stressing 
the 
importance 
of 

Martin Luther King Jr.’s role 
toward the pursuit of unity and 
peace throughout the nation. She 
highlighted his message of gaining 
equity, social justice and peace for 
all, including women and students, 
through non-violent actions in 
particular. 

“The strife of the ‘60s is 

remembered as racial, but it was 
much more than that because it 
galvanized the nation because of 
the growth in equity we had at that 
time to civil rights, to poverty, to 
education, to jobs and to gender,” 
Sinkford said.

In addition, Sinkford discussed 

a change in today’s struggle for 
civil rights. She said she believes 
that while the church used to be 
the control center for American 

civil rights activism — teaching 
the traditional values of hierarchal 
leadership and respectable politics, 
as well as principles of reconciliation 
and nonviolence — students and 
activists today work without the 
church’s 
leadership 
and 
reject 

conservative values.

She also touched on her beliefs 

that students today have managed 
to describe the experience of feeling 
isolated on campus ude to race and 
used that to launch many successful 
events, including town hall meetings 
and teach-ins across the country.

Sinkford said she believes that 

if King were alive today, he would 
not only applaud these students in 
their efforts to better the learning 
environment on campus, but would 
continue to serve as the inspiration 
toward non-violence.

“He would continue to link 

justice 
with 
both 
equity 
and 

equality, and he would advocate for 
the elimination of disparities in the 
health system,” Sinkford said.

Speaking to healthcare, she 

noted the importance of King’s 
recognition that the most inhuman 
inequalities are those that exist in 
our health care systems, and praised 
President Barack Obama’s work 
toward better incorporating equity 
into health care decisions today.

She also spoke of the positive 

attributes that have been made to 
health services, specifically citing 
those made in dental health, and 
several that she helped to create. 
Her efforts include participating 
in changing the academic policies 
for the American Dental Education 
Association and helping create 
the 2004 Sullivan Commission 
on Diversity in the Healthcare 
Workforce, an effort that aimed 
to increase diversity in America’s 
health 
professions 
education 

training programs.

Sinkford ended her speech by 

stating that she believed academic 
institutions will continue to invest 
in goals that lead toward better 
access to health care.

“I really think our academic 

institutions will lead across the 
health spectrum,” she said. “They’ll 
move toward more efficient patient 
care, greater use of onsite facilities, 

Students discuss 

different response to 
personal and social 

disagreement

By CAMY METWALLY

Daily Staff Reporter

Participants in the “Conflict 

Monologues,” an annual Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day event organized 
by the Student Conflict Resolution 
Advisory Board, addressed ways to 
handle various levels of conflict — 
from roommate problems to issues 
of identity — in their lives Monday.

About 15 students sat in a 

circle at the Michigan Union for 
the event to reflect on the idea 
of conflict and how to instigate 
resolution 
and 
restoration. 

Students 
and 
facilitators 

discussed whether conflict and 
confrontation 
are 
mutually 

exclusive, how identities are 
reflected in the ways different 
individuals handle conflict and 
whether all conflicts are solvable.

Engineering sophomore Suzy 

Haupt, who participated in the 
dialogue, said King’s experience 
with conflict — and his choice to 
confront it with nonviolence and 
love — was unique,

“I think that this is a really 

good event to have during MLK 

symposium,” Haupt said. “While 
it’s not the traditional racism talk 
during MLK day, I think it’s a really 
important issue that needs to be 
discussed.”

Though the open forum attracted 

a diverse group of students, many 
attendees were resident advisers 
who were interested in learning 
more about this particular subject. 
Haupt, an RA, said she sometimes 
struggles handling conflict among 
the residents in her hall.

“I was really looking forward to 

this event to help me broaden my 
understanding of different ways to 
confront them and how different 
people think about conflicts, so I’ll 
better be able to help my residents 
and manage my hall,” Haupt said.

Though the word “conflict” 

typically 
carries 
a 
negative 

connotation, the group emphasized 
how dispute plays a vital role in 
progress. LSA sophomore Austin 
Fregene argued that a community 
cannot grow without discussing 
contradictory opinions.

“Conflict doesn’t have to be 

negative,” Fregene said. “It can be 
constructive, and it doesn’t have 
to happen right away; it can take 
time. Conflict is the cornerstone 
of growth and genesis, of positive 
things.”

Fregene also said he appreciates 

events such as this one, where 
ideas are respectfully challenged, 
because he believes everyone gains 

from honest discussion.

“Beliefs 
are 
meant 
to 
be 

challenged,” Fregene said. “Ideas 
are meant to be talked about and 
things are meant to be discussed. 
I don’t feel that we get the most 
out of our lives if we don’t have 
moments where our beliefs and 
our ideas are challenged or thought 
about because that’s how you know 
that they’re strong — they’ve been 
tested.”

Echoing Fregene’s sentiment, 

LSA junior Lauren Shepard, a 
member of the SCR Advisory Board, 
said the annual event served to 
facilitate dialogue and strengthen 
interpersonal relationships in an 
open, safe space.

“Without discussion, nothing is 

going to happen,” Shepard said.

Education junior Samantha Suh 

said she respected the differences 
among the group members during 
the dialogue. She added that she 
thought participating in candid 
conversations 
and 
empathizing 

with different perspectives gives 
participants a level of respect 
necessary in all situations of 
conflict.

As an RA at East Quad, Suh said 

she hopes to educate her residents 
on the diverse ways to approach and 
understand conflict.

“I think in certain situations, 

some people just have no idea how 
another person can act like that or 
say something like that,” Suh said.

LSA SOPHOMORE JARED HEDDINGER

LSA sophomore Jared 
Heddinger talks about his 
experiences making the 
most of cooking resources on 
campus.

Can you tell me about your 
cooking adventure?

It was an adventure with 
college apartment cooking. 
My friends called me over 
one night and were like “Hey, 
do you know anything about 
cooking ribs?” So I walked 
over to their apartment — 
which we affectionately call 
the “trap house”— and they 
have a slab of frozen ribs just 
sitting on their table. My 
first instinct was to ask them 
where they got them, and 
apparently they got them 
from a friend who had had 

them in their apartment for 
a couple months just in the 
freezer. They were having 
this internal conflict to 
figure out if they wanted to 
make these ribs that could 
or could not be edible. So 
we spent over twenty-five 
minutes googling whether 
or not it was safe to eat these 
ribs. We eventually did eat 
them. Then my friend asked 
me if I wanted to make 
some banana bread because 
they had a couple overripe 
bananas just sitting out. 
So I was like “Sure, do you 
have flour and eggs and 
stuff?” and they had none of 
that. So basically, the night 
culminated with us eating 
ribs that were like fours 
months old, some banana 
bread that was made with 

protein powder, peanut 
butter, oats, and moldy 
bananas, and chips and 
salsa.

What do you think your 
experience says about the 
college lifestyle?

I think it definitely says a 
lot about the adaptability of 
college students and how we 
make do with what we have.

Do you see yourself 
having this sort of 
adventure in the future?

Yeah, I think it’s always fun 
to stay on your toes and try 
and make do with what you 
have.

Rackham to Snyder’s Ann Arbor condo 

at 211 S. Main St. where they formed a 

moving circle and cheered loudly.

Chants from the protest included 

“Justice for Flint, arrest Rick Snyder” 

and “Democracy, democracy, that’s our 

right; Snyder stole it, that’s our fight.” 

Buttons were also passed out that said 

“Arrest Rick Snyder” and featured an 

image of Snyder, handcuffed, wearing 

a black and white striped prisoner’s 

uniform.

Jan BenDor, Ypsilanti resident 

and another organizer of the event, 

helped organize another attempt to 

fire Snyder in 2011. Her complaint 

at the time was that Snyder was 

promoting 
privatizing 
all 
public 

services. Some Michigan residents 

have filed petitions to recall Snyder to 

the Board of Canvassors. Though most 

of the petitions were denied, two are 

currently pending approval. 

BenDor said Snyder should be taken 

out of office and charged with federal 

crimes for his responsibility in the 

water crisis. She said she saw Snyder’s 

neglect of the water conditions in Flint 

as akin to an act of terrorism.

“Snyder managed to do what ISIS 

could never do,” BenDor said.

The organizers of the protest also 

created a GoFundMe account to raise 

money to buy bottled water and filters 

for the people of Flint. They said other, 

more permanent fundraising efforts 

are in the works.

Several University students in 

attendance declined interviews.

Katie Oppenheim, a registered 

nurse and president of the University 

Nurse’s Union, agreed that Snyder 

should be held responsible for his 

dishonesty about the severe levels of 

lead in Flint water leading up to the 

city’s state of emergency.

Oppenheim recently visited Flint 

and said the tap water was the color of 

mustard and essentially toxic, barring 

citizens from access to clean water to 

live.

John Armelagos, a registered nurse 

from Ypsilanti and an officer of the 

Michigan Nurse’s Association, said at 

the event Flint residents who drank 

the public water are susceptible to 

lifelong illnesses. Armelagos noted 

that children and infants are prone 

to developmental issues affecting 

all parts of their bodies, including 

their brains, and risk being unable to 

reach their full intellectual potential. 

Adults may also suffer various kinds 

of illnesses, including those impacting 

reproductive health.

space for people of color interested 
in making radical social change. 
LaGrand said for Boggs, it was 
important to view issues as people 
and not politics.

“We need to embrace the idea 

that we are the leaders we’ve been 
looking for,” LaGrand said.

In speaking about the biases of 

the individual that inhibit social 
change, LaGrand highlighted how 
important it is that students learn 
about groups and communities 
different from their own through 
the process of practice-based 
evidence.

“When we solely rely on 

research and evaluation we’re not 
really giving voices to the people 
who need them,” LaGrand said. 
“As students, education doesn’t 
necessarily make us experts, but 
because we have education we 
must advocate certain things that 
communities want.”

She added that increasing 

attention to social justice is a 
double-edged 
sword. 
While 

it draws awareness to social 
issues, she said, it skews who is 
responsible for social change

“Education and money doesn’t 

give (students) a free pass to go 
wherever we want,” LaGrand 
said. “When we stop buying into 
what is done, that’s when we 
become radical.”

Activist 
Jim 
Toy, 
who 

co-founded the Spectrum Center 
at the University and worked with 
Boggs, said during the workshop 
each individual has their own area 
of the world, their corner, that 
they are responsible for making 
more socially aware.

“Grace had a corner and she 

brightened that corner where she 
was and we each I think are called 
to brighten our own corner,” Toy 
said.

Sharon Howell, an Oakland 

University 
professor 
of 

communication and journalism, 
met Boggs in 1973, and said she 
worked with Boggs and her 
husband on a daily basis for 
decades.

Howell said Boggs believed 

Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a 
time to think and talk about how 
civil movements can progress, 
especially given her relationship 
with 
King, 
which 
Howell 

described as contentious at times.

She noted that because she 

was not a worker and came from 
a privileged background, Boggs 
had difficulty fitting in when she 
moved to Chicago, and Howell 
said it was not until Boggs married 
and moved to a Black community 
in Detroit that she was able to find 
a home. Howell said there was no 
safer place for anyone at that time 
than within the Black community.

“If a Black family moved into 

say, Livonia, we’re gonna hear a 
lot more about it than we do the 
gentrification that’s happening 
in Detroit,” Howell said. “Grace 
loved Detroit not just because of 
its people but because in Detroit 
an evolution is happening of a 
profound scale.”

University 
alum 
Chase 

Cantrell, 
who 
attended 
the 

workshop, said he has participated 
in the symposium every year since 
2001. He said he saw Boggs speak 
at a meeting of the Michigan 
Progressives and was impressed 
and inspired by what she had to 
say.

“I’ve 
been 
contemplating 

starting a nonprofit organization 
in Detroit,” Cantrell said. “Being 
here it makes me want to move 
forward with that goal.”

Social 
Work 
student 
Liz 

Zhang, an international student, 
said because of her background 
as a Chinese woman, she related 
to the story of Bogg’s life and her 
struggle to fit in.

I came to college, and I saw so 
many beautiful Black women 
embracing 
their 
“Blackness” 

by 
participating 
in 
student 

organizations celebrating Black 
women, activism in the Black 
Lives Matter Movement and more. 
As I saw others celebrating their 
Blackness, I began to think about 
my identity as a Black woman in a 
different, more positive and visible 
light. I began to notice a growing 
group of “naturalistas” that were 
on campus. Naturalistas, curly 
heads, curlies — whatever you want 
to call it — have become the names 
for women, specifically women of 
color, who embrace their natural 
hair pattern. For me, it was my 
curls. For others it may be waves 
or kinks. For others, it might mean 
protecting their natural hair in 
styles like box braids, Senegalese 
twists, locs, crochet braids and 
much more. There was this drive 
among many to recreate the 
conceptions of beauty, especially 
when it came to hair. Embracing 
these nonstandard forms of beauty 
has become a way of making a 
statement. 

Take Angela Davis, for example. 

Davis, a woman strongly associated 
with the Black power movement 
in the 1960s, is as famous for her 
activism as she is for her afro. Often 
times, she is even referred to as “The 
Afro.” This image of her natural 
hair became a historical symbol 
that served as both a negative and 
positive representation throughout 
the decades. As a radical Black 
revolutionary, she was portrayed 
as a communist and anti-white, 
and her afro became a negative 
representation. She was sought 
out by the FBI because of her 
membership with the Communist 
Party, and soon the stigma of 
criminalization became strongly 
associated with Black women 
who — like Angela Davis — wore 
their hair “natural.” Black women 
began to be harassed, arrested 
by the police and discriminated 
against simply because of the way 
they wore their hair. These women 
became targeted, their hair seen 
as an object of suppression, rather 

than being a positive, unique and 
celebrated part of them. Women 
began to feel self-conscious toward 
their 
hair, 
causing 
increasing 

feelings of self-hate because of the 
negative stigmas surrounding race 
and ethnic features. Women began 
to revert back to the belief that, the 
closer they were to looking “white,” 
the better.

Though this was back in the 

‘60s, this self-hate has manifested 
itself throughout generations and 
is still inherent in many Black 
women today. It’s Black women’s 
use of makeup to make themselves 
appear of a lighter skin tone. It’s 
little girls asking their mothers 
to put bleach in their bath water. 
It’s the assumption that any Black 
woman who is considered beautiful 
cannot possibly be fully Black, 
that there must be some trace of 
another race that contributes to 
her beauty. It’s me thinking that I 
am only presentable when my hair 
is straight. It’s you telling me that 
when I go into work for you that 
I can’t “wear my hair how it is,” 
insinuating that my curly fro isn’t 
professional. All of these instances 
are sending the message that Black 
women are only beautiful when 
they conform to the standard 
image of the white woman.

But this natural hair movement 

is about way more than race. It is 
a stand to challenge the limits of 
beauty. It’s promoting self-love. It’s 
about celebrating health — healthy 
body, healthy hair and in return, 
healthy mind. When I wear my 
natural curls, I feel free in a way 
that challenges me to redefine 
beauty. It took me about two to 
three years to fully feel confident 
in wearing my curly fro, as I had 
to train myself in seeing the beauty 
in my natural curls. Even now, I 
still have my moments of feeling 
self-conscious that my hair is too 
big or draws too much attention to 
my Blackness. It’s a constant battle 
between my own perceptions and 
what I see in society.

I often think about how I will 

teach my daughter this broadened 
definition of beauty. For me, 
encouraging her to have confidence 
in her natural beauty is the first 
step. For a young girl, being able 
to be comfortable in her raw 
beauty without comparing herself 

to societal standards is essential 
for her growth into a confident 
woman. And I’m not saying that 
you did not teach me these things. 
I appreciate the lessons you taught 
me throughout my childhood. You 
taught me humility, discipline, 
obedience, independence and so 
much more. But one thing I hoped 
we could have learned together is 
self-love. And by self-love, I don’t 
necessarily mean us as individuals, 
but us as Black women. I am so 
grateful that this natural hair 
journey allowed me to not only 
grow in loving myself, but to love 
the diverse array of beauty that I 
see in Black women. It’s allowed 
me to become part of this growing 
community of “naturalistas” who 
all celebrate and uplift each other. 
Being able to embrace myself, 
while celebrating the beauty of 
other women who look like me, 
creates such a liberating feeling.

I think this is why I’m writing 

this letter to you, as well as making 
it public. It’s not to embarrass you, 
or expose you for anything. But I 
wanted to address this problem 
many of us have of not thinking 
critically and questioning what 
have we been fed. What’s really 
so wrong about wearing an afro 
or cornrows in the workplace? 
What makes it unprofessional? I’d 
challenge you to give me a logical 
answer to these questions. I bet 
not many can. I’m confident in 
this statement because it’s clear 
that many of us fail to look beyond 
what society “says” and decide 
for ourselves what is acceptable, 
or beautiful. By not doing this, 
we are tricked into believing that 
our brown skin isn’t beautiful, 
or that our wild, kinky curls are 
unacceptable.

I want to feel truth in waking 

up every morning in seeing my 
beauty — whether my hair be 
straight or curly, whether I put on 
makeup or I don’t. I want every 
little girl, and especially every little 
brown girl, to look in the mirror 
and see the beauty in the physical 
features that make her unique. It’s 
time to encourage each other and 
challenge each other to see beauty 
in all different colors, shapes and 
sizes.

community based programs and 
patient centered care.”

She added that she believes 

that working toward being more 
diverse in our health care systems 
and having more equity within 
our nation will take constant 
vigilance.

Nursing senior Madeline Dahl, 

who attended the event, said she 
thought Sinkford’s message of 
working toward being a diverse 
community within all the health 
care fields will be a lifelong 
struggle and goal.

“We are constantly going to 

be having to update how we feel 
about it and what we think about 
it and stretching our minds as 
things change in the world and as 
things change in health care,” she 
said.

HEALTH CARE

“Who will be next is asking 

you what is it that you see that 
others may not,” she said. “What 
is it that you hear that others may 
be ignoring? The world doesn’t 
need the next Martin Luther 
King Jr. The world needs the 
next you.” 

Speaking 
to 
recent 
police 

shootings of unarmed Black men 
and deaths of Black individuals in 
police custody, Tutu said the first 
step in achieving social justice 
is acknowledging injustice. She 
referred to Tamir Rice, who was 
shot by police officers in Cleveland, 
Ohio who mistook his toy gun for a 
real one. 

“We start in recognizing that it 

is not right that a twelve year old 
can be playing in a playground and 
thirty seconds later he is dead,” she 
said. “It is not right that a young 
woman is stopped at a traffic stop, 
and a few days later is dead. It is not 
right. It is not right that children in 
Syria live in fear.” 

Tutu said making social and 

political 
improvements 
that 

work to combat these instances 
of injustice does not require a 
global platform. The contributions 
individuals make on a smaller, local 
level are equally as impactful, she 
said.

“We are not all going to be Nobel 

Peace Prize winners. Believe me, I 
know because I’ve been nominated 
about 15 times,” Tutu said. “We can 
all be community peace activists.”

Tutu 
also 
acknowledged 

what 
she 
called 
the 
hugely 

overwhelming feeling individuals 
experience when aiming to address 
issues of injustice society.

“We see all these things that 

are not right. And it’s easy to 
look at all those things and feel 
overwhelmed,” she said. “But if we 
look at all of those who when the 
question was asked during their 
lives, “who will be next” If we look 
at those who stepped up, we will 
see that they didn’t let the extent 
of the problem to overwhelm 
them.”

Despite hearing accounts of 

extreme injustice in the media 
regularly, 
Tutu 
said 
she 
is 

encouraged by the grassroots 
activism that has formed as a result.

“I hold on to hope by the skin 

of teeth and I’m able to hold on to 
hope because I see so many not 
waiting to be asked who will be 

next,” she said. “I see so many 
being courageous enough to put 
out their hands to those who will 
dehumanize them. I see so many 
who say I know our world can be 
better. And here where I am is 
where I will make a difference.”

Tutu ended her remarks with a 

challenge.

“I stand here as one who knows 

that injustice can be turned to 
justice, who knows that oppression 
that can be moved to freedom, who 
knows hate can be conquered by 
love,” Tutu said. “And I stand here 
asking each one of you, please, will 
you be next?”

After Tutu’s remarks Robert 

Sellers, Vice Provost for Equity, 
Inclusion, and Academic Affairs, 
stressed 
#WhoWillBeNext 
is 

also about reflecting upon the far 
reaching effects of individual acts 
of injustice.

“If you replace the picture of Dr. 

King with Trayvon Martin, Tamir 
Rice, or the kids, children and 
people of Flint, who will be next 
means something quite different,” 
he said. “It’s a clear warning that if 
one of us is not safe, then none of us 
are safe. It is a clear warning that 
injustice for even one of us means 
there is no justice for any of us.”

In University President Mark 

Schlissel’s opening remarks at the 
address, he said the symposium 
serves as a chance for the University 
community to come together and 
reflect on racial issues.

“Our University is a place 

where traditions live and thrive 
with influence that spans decades, 
unites generations, and enlightens 
our nation,” Schlissel said. “This 
symposium is one such tradition 
at the University of Michigan. It 
gives us the cherished opportunity 
to come together as a community 
to discuss important ideas and 
issues regarding race, inclusion and 
justice and embrace the core of our 
nation to serve society.” 

The event also featured a choral 

performance 
from 
the 
Men’s 

Glee Club, who sang a tribute to 
the innocent young lives taken 
as a result of police brutality 
called “Seven Last Words of the 
Unarmed,” arranged by composer 
Joel Thompson.

The 
group 
also 
performed 

“Glory” which was arranged by 
popular artists Common and John 
Legend. The song was featured in 
the critically acclaimed film Selma, 
a chronicle of Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr.’s struggle to gain the right 
to vote for Black Americans. 

Before beginning her lecture, 

Tutu praised the Glee Club for their 
performance, saying it caused her 
to feel a range of emotions. After 
their performance, Tutu joked, “I 
now know the meaning of cruel 
and unusual punishment, and that 
is to follow your University Men’s 
Glee Club!”

In an interview with the Daily 

after the event, LSA sophomore 
Amber Browder said she felt a close 
connection to Tutu during her 
lecture.

“What she was saying really 

hit home for me because I have 
younger siblings who will one day 
be adult black males,” she said. 
“When she was talking, I felt like 
I was just having a one on one 
conversation with her. She made 
me feel like she was talking to me 
directly.”

School of Music, Theatre & 

Dance senior Marcus Peterson, 
who was a soloist in the Glee 
Club’s performance, said Tutu’s 
remarks 
encouraged 
him 
to 

further pursue his career in vocal 
performance.

“It makes me want to pursue 

my career even further seeing that 
there aren’t many opera singers of 
my color out there in the world,” he 
said. “This has made me want to go 
even further and reach the whole 
world.”

Jacob Belardo, LSA freshman 

and Glee Club member, said he 
was affected by Tutu’s cadence and 
language as well as her emphasis 
on personal accountability and 
potential.

“The way she spoke – you listen 

to every word she said. It was like 
poetry,” Belardo said. “I liked that 
she emphasized that we’re all 
human beings and that we all came 
from a space where we’re equal, 
but we all have the opportunity 
to change things – even if it’s just 
here, even if it’s just going onstage 
and singing a song.”

Glee club performer Michael 

Chrzan, a senior in both LSA and 
the School of Education, said the 
emotionally charged content of the 
group’s repertoire brought him to 
tears on stage.

“For me, as someone who 

identifies as an African American 
male, it’s always emotional,” 
Chrzan said. He added, “I know 
people that could be these 
people… and so every time we 
sing it I think of that and it gets 
to me, but I also center on the 
idea that this is a message that we 
need to get out.”

H

is 
rhetoric, 
passionate; 

his rallies, electric; his 
supporters, eclectic. Sen. 

Bernie 
Sand-

ers has captured 
the hearts and 
minds of exas-
perated 
voters 

across the coun-
try who want to 
restructure our 
economy to bet-
ter enfranchise 
people 
of 
all 

classes, 
colors 

and creeds. This 
makes him the 
best available candidate for secre-
tary of labor.

Now, I know, Americans don’t 

actually vote for secretary of labor. 
The secretary of labor is nominated 
by the president and then approved 
by the Senate. That being said, Sen. 
Sanders, with his impassioned focus 
throughout his political career on 
leveling the economic playing field, 
makes an excellent appointee.

Sen. Sanders is, in fact, running 

for president. I wholeheartedly 
agree with his goals of “a progres-
sive economic agenda that creates 
jobs, raises wages, protects the 
environment and provides health-
care for all.” I also agree with 
his desire to advance the social 
services that our global partners 
have had for years, allowing for 
lower rates of incarceration, lower 
income inequality and better health 
outcomes for less money. Many of 
these goals fit within the mandate 
of a secretary of labor, however, 
more so than that of the president.

The president has a greater 

responsibility. In addition to cul-
tivating an environment in which 
all Americans have the tools and 
opportunity to live up to their 
potential, a president needs to 
maintain America’s image abroad. 
To do so, a president of the United 
States must demand respect on the 
world stage. They must have intri-
cate knowledge of both how to 
make our country a better place to 

live in and how to tackle problems 
that involve a diverse set of global 
stakeholders with vastly different 
histories, cultures and social envi-
ronments.

Now, I understand that as a 

child of immigrants who has lived 
abroad, I may approach this issue 
with a slightly different perspec-
tive. It is a perspective, however, 
that I feel is important when con-
sidering your choice for our next 
president.

Growing up in South Africa, my 

friends and I saw the United States 
in its best light. We saw a country of 
plenty with the resources to provide 
its citizens with the opportunity to 
achieve their dreams. Moving to 
the United States, and the accom-
panying experiences, has slowly 
exposed the naiveté of my idealistic 
fantasy, but I still hold that how the 
United States is portrayed abroad 
is important strategically and a 
responsibility of the president.

President George W. Bush’s 

years in office exposed some of 
the worst sides of America to the 
world at large. We saw unchecked 
military oversteps and govern-
ment-endorsed — or at least not 
government-condemned 
— 
sci-

entific denial. Conversely, Presi-
dent Obama, in my opinion, has 
restored some trust in the United 
States through his global leader-
ship. He negotiated the Iran deal 
and played a pivotal role in the 
recent climate change COP21 con-
ference. While not everything he 
has done has worked to restore 
global trust in the United States 
(for example, his use of drones), 
there have been concrete steps 
taken in the right direction.

In this respect, I feel that Sen. 

Sanders is unprepared. While his 
nuanced grasp of our stacked deck 
of an economy is admirable, his 
failure to demonstrate any desire to 
take on foreign policy questions is 
concerning.

The advantages of a healthy glob-

al image, while it may seem unim-
portant to an average American, 

provides us with not only increased 
security and an increased ability to 
shape global affairs, but also with an 
inflow of migrants who propel our 
economy forward — drawn, like my 
parents, to the opportunity of better 
lives for their children. Creating and 
nurturing that image takes time, and 
given Sen. Sanders’s lack of global 
name recognition and experience, I 
am not yet sure he is the best candi-
date to continue President Obama’s 
progress on this front.

Secretary Hillary Clinton cer-

tainly has the poise and expertise to 
effectively maintain and strength-
en our image abroad. She is, howev-
er, not without her drawbacks. The 
Clinton name, for one, is haunted by 
past controversy. Her association 
with Establishment American poli-
tics may be as much of a liability as 
it is an asset in our current political 
climate. Lastly, her trustworthi-
ness rating among potential voters 
is frighteningly low.

That being said, it seems presi-

dential elections are as much about 
persona as they are about grasp of 
the issues. Judging by Secretary 
Clinton’s most recent debate perfor-
mance, in addition to her mastery 
of both domestic and international 
issues, she can successfully weave 
together policy and emotion to 
make a succinct argument for how 
to move forward as a country.

At this point in the election sea-

son, I am highly conflicted. While 
I recognize the importance of Sen. 
Sanders’ domestic message, his 
seeming lack of interest in global 
affairs discredits him on the world 
stage and makes him a better candi-
date for secretary of labor than for 
president. Secretary Clinton has a 
complete grasp of the responsibili-
ties of the presidency, but she needs 
to prove that her missteps will stay 
in the past.

The primary is not until March, 

though; plenty of time to start feel-

T

hursday night’s GOP primary debate 
was business as usual. “The Donald” 
was loud and off the cuff, squab-

bling with Ted Cruz over 
poll numbers in Iowa. 
We were reminded of the 
real challenges facing the 
United States, like The 
New York Times and Hill-
ary Clinton. As a proud 
son of New Jersey, every 
fiber in my being wanted 
to disown Chris Christie 
when he spoke, and Ben 
Carson seemed to hover 
somewhere 
between 
a 

casual nap and the deep-
est of REM cycles.

To the naked eye skimming headlines Fri-

day morning, the contest on Fox Business 
Network was standard operating procedure. 
With one big exception — moderators Neil 
Cavuto and Maria Bartiromo offered the most 
unabashedly biased performance in the pres-
idential primaries to date. They asked ques-
tions that played to Republicans’ strengths, 
they neglected to ask follow-ups and kept 
the conversation centered on the candidates’ 
strengths — national security, gun rights and 
Obama-bashing.

The softballs started early with a ques-

tion to Gov. Christie regarding appropriate 
use of military action 
by a president, a ques-
tion worthy of any pri-
mary debate. That is, 
if the question had not 
been so loaded. Bar-
tiromo 
prefaced 
her 

inquiry 
with 
discus-

sion of Iran’s capture 
of 
American 
sailors, 

North Korea’s nuclear 
ambitions, “an aggres-
sive China,” a deterio-
rating Middle East and 
a stronger ISIS. “Some-
times,” she continued, 
teeing it up for Christie. 
“It seems the world is 
on fire.” Offering a clearly alarmed summa-
ry of evil in the world, coaxing Christie into 
his bread and butter of fear mongering and 
“no-nonsense” statements, Bartiromo’s ques-
tion simplified the complexities of national 
security and military engagement beyond 
all reason. How do we keep Americans safe? 
Strengthen the military. Talk to our allies. It’s 
that easy!

Later, Trump was asked about whether 

or not, if he should win the White House, he 
could unite the Republican Party. The mod-
erators waited politely as the front-runner 
chose to dance around the question, reciting 
a slice of his stump speech on incompetence 
and anger. Time constraints then (supposed-
ly) forbade Bartiromo’s follow-up that anyone 
at home might have phrased, “Did you even 
try to answer the question, or were you dis-
tracted by a bumblebee while I asked it and 
decided to just spout your usual nonsense?”

To be fair, Cavuto spoke up and asserted, 

“That wasn’t my question” before Marco 
Rubio picked up too much steam when 
attempting to pivot from a question on the 
Common Core to national security. I was 
ready to chalk this one up to seven politicians, 
whose bad habit of not answering questions 
was exacerbated by the pressure and fanfare 
of the approaching Iowa caucuses. The mod-
erators were struggling, but maybe ascribing 
too much of the blame to them was unfair. 

But then came the most ridiculous question 
of them all.

Introduced through the question of wheth-

er or not Bill Clinton’s past indiscretions are 
a legitimate topic in this election, Ben Carson 
was asked, “What do you think of the notion 
that Hillary Clinton is an enabler of sexual 
misconduct?”

Ignoring how irrelevant this question 

should be to Republican primary voters 
(though the question was met with applause) 
and bypassing the ridiculously misogynistic 
notion that a woman is somehow respon-
sible for a man’s misconduct, consider this 
question for what it really says — Ben Car-
son, would you like to take a free shot at the 
Democratic front-runner, who we view as 
the devil incarnate? Here, let me provide you 
with some ammo. Fire away with condescen-
sion and platitudes about values.

Through loaded questions, softballs and a 

strange aversion to ask follow-ups, the jour-
nalistic failures of the moderators allowed 
the candidates to play to their strengths of 
grandstanding and fear mongering. Trump 
spoke about “bombings all over,” and predict-
ed “many to follow” in the footsteps of Paris. 
Christie told us how, if you want to keep your 
homes and your families safe, “you cannot 
give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack 
Obama’s leadership.” Carson summoned up 
images of cyberbombs, attacks on our elec-

trical grid and “dirty 
bombs,” (shortly before 
he misused the word 
existential, 
which 
is 

another story entirely). 
Why? Because the basis 
of these campaign strat-
egies is fear. Fear of who 
in the world wants to 
attack us, who is coming 
to take your guns and 
the apocalyptic post-
American society that 
will exist if a Democrat 
wins.

Just 
like 
Burgess 

Meredith in “Rocky II,” 
the 
moderators 
were 

clearly in the GOP’s corner, introducing Hill-
ary Clinton as some sort of Clubber Lang in a 
pantsuit, egging them on in a less than subtle 
way. But don’t take my word for it. Count the 
number of follow-ups. Go back and read the 
questions asked. Hear how they were set up. 
Listen to the tone and bias. Hear how it has 
no place in political journalism. Fox Business 
did its job Thursday night. Unfortunately, 
that job apparently was not to present the best 
form of argument to the American people, but 
to insulate the GOP contenders and drum up 
a few soundbites along the way. Look no fur-
ther than the litany of topics omitted from 
the conversation.

Issues from the minimum wage to the 

skyrocketing cost of higher education, from 
income inequality to campaign finance 
reform and women’s reproductive rights 
were not deemed important enough to grace 
the stage. However, the cardinal sin may have 
been that just a 15-minute drive away from 
the site of the Charleston AME Church shoot-
ing, the role of race in criminal justice was 
mentioned once, by Jeb Bush.

Why? Because Republicans are much bet-

ter at talking about ISIS, immigration and Bill 
Clinton’s sex life.

Fear mongering and softballs

S

low down, you crazy child. So 
you’ve finished final exams. 
But the stress doesn’t stop 

there. It just piv-
ots from those 
dreaded 
test 

scores to sum-
mer internships, 
job hunts or per-
haps larger existential crises. We 
each have our own ways of dealing 
with the burdens of college life, and 
Winter Break is surely a good start. 
For me, the best method of escape 
is a pair of noise-canceling head-
phones.

A timely release by Larry Fish-

erman, rapper Mac Miller’s pia-
no-playing alter ego, reminds me 
of what’s most important when 
the pressures of school feel insur-
mountable. Miller reworks the Billy 
Joel record “Vienna” with darker, 
pitch-shifted vocals. This stripped-
down cover, absent of any drums or 
bass, is a sign of Mac Miller’s matu-
ration as an artist, but also a sign 
that he faces the same problems that 
college-aged, entry-level job appli-
cants face today.

Miller asks, in the first verse, “If 

you’re so smart, why are you still 
so afraid?” The reinvigorated lyr-
ics ring just as true today for any 
University student feeling moti-
vated, yet demoralized at an unclear 
future as they did on the release of 
the 1977 album The Stranger. It’s 
not surprising that Miller chose to 
recreate this Joel classic. The rap-
per has experienced quick success, 
but at 23, he has the world ahead of 
him, and that can be intimidating. 
Miller is like any of us. Studying at 
Michigan is a great start, but that 
doesn’t make the road ahead any 
less treacherous. The overwhelm-
ing sense of uncertainty is partly 
what I’m afraid of.

The song raises several difficult 

questions — difficult because we 
may not want to answer them:

“Where’s the fire, what’s the 

hurry about? / You’d better cool it 

off before you burn it out / There’s 
so much to do and only so many 
hours in the day.”

It’s easy to get caught up in the rat 

race of Ann Arbor. And it’s even eas-
ier for me (or Joel or Miller) to tell 
you to slow down before you burn 
it out. But I think it’s important to 
remember that career goals are only 
half of the picture. Setting personal 
goals to spend time with those close 
to you, being outside more or help-
ing others can put things in per-
spective. New York Times writer 

David Brooks raises an interest-
ing point in his book “The Road to 
Character.” We focus a lot of our 
attention on “resume virtues” to 
further our careers, rather than 
“eulogy virtues,” the traits we’d like 
to be remembered for. When you’re 
sprinting toward a target, you may 
be going too fast to realize you’re 
aiming in the wrong direction. So, 
really, what’s the hurry about?

Recently, I’ve been contemplat-

ing what’s next for me as a second-
semester senior. What jobs should I 
be applying for? Is law school a good 
decision for my long-term career 
goals? The choices I make now will 
dictate the path I head down, and 
that’s a lot to digest. It’s unrealis-
tic to think that where I want to be 
in 10 years is where I will actually 
end up. It’s fun to dream, though 

— maybe I could be an indie record 
label executive, or maybe I could 
manage a talented, emerging musi-
cian. We have no choice but to take 
a blind leap toward a career we’re 
passionate about and hope for the 
best. Joel’s four-decade-old lyrics 
sum up my feelings towards dream 
chasing:

“You’ve got your passion, you’ve 

got your pride / But don’t you know 
that only fools are satisfied? / Dream 
on, but don’t imagine that they’ll all 
come true”

There’s a sense of complacency 

in satisfaction. To set lofty goals 
is healthy, even if we never quite 
get there. It requires reinven-
tion. Eight years ago, Miller began 
releasing mixtapes in high school 
and then moved on to producing 
his own independently distributed 
chart-topping albums. Since, Miller 
has released music using several 
aliases, including Larry Fisher-
man, Delusional Thomas and jazz 
frontman Larry Lovestein with the 
Velvet Revolver. Miller continues 
to redefine his sound as a musician, 
instrumentalist and producer. In 
an industry packed with a surplus 
of artists, it can be hard to stay rel-
evant.

We are all trying to break into 

industries flooded with talented 
candidates. That alone can be a lot 
of pressure to keep your foot on the 
gas. So when your tank’s on empty 
and the grind has taken its toll, don’t 
hesitate to turn the lights down, put 
on your headphones and take a step 
back.

But if I haven’t persuaded you, it 

may sound more convincing in lyri-
cal form:

“Slow down, you crazy child / 

Take the phone off the hook and 
disappear for a while / It’s all right, 
you can afford to lose a day or two / 
When will you realize, Vienna waits 
for you.”

‘Good Wife’ makes 
a disjointed return

With showrunners 
on the way out, CBS 
drama needs to go 

back to basics

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

One of the big pieces of news to 

come out of the Television Crit-
ics Association 
Press Tour this 
past week was 
that Robert and 
Michelle 
King 

(“In 
Justice”), 

the 
showrun-

ners 
of 
“The 

Good 
Wife” 

since the begin-
ning of its run, 
are leaving the 
show to pur-
sue other projects. There’s still 
a chance the show will continue 
for a season eight, but it will be 
without its two key voices. Hon-
estly, their leaving might be the 
best thing that could happen to 
the show. The pair has done a lot 
of great things with these charac-
ters and this world, but the Kings’ 
contributions are starting to feel 
long in the tooth as the show 
pushes weaker political storylines 
and artificial character separa-
tion. The mid-season premiere of 
the drama has a little bit of both 
sides: a fantastic opening scene 
followed by an episode of political 
bullshit.

The mid-season finale closed 

with Eli Gold (Alan Cumming, 
“Strange Magic”) revealing to 
Alicia (Julianna Margulies, “ER”) 
that he deleted a voicemail from 
her former partner Will Gardner 
where he declared that he loved 
her and would leave everything 
for her. Alicia tells Eli to “get out” 
in the premiere, but he doesn’t 
leave. Instead, he tries to talk to 
her. Alicia reacts slowly, taking 
some plates out of a cabinet and 
painstakingly sorting through 
the pile. As Alicia goes through 
each one, the tension builds, espe-
cially because Margulies shows 
little emotion. But when Alicia 
starts throwing the plates at Eli, 
there’s a release. In that moment, 

Margulies is legitimately terrify-
ing, bringing up a groundswell of 
anger and sadness which comes 
from grief and a wonder for what 
could have been. It reminded me 
of the show at its best, when the 
emotional impact of the charac-
ter’s decisions produced unparal-
leled drama. 

If only the rest of the episode 

lived up to its opening, as it spends 
the rest of its time following Peter 
Florrick’s (Chris Noth, “Sex and 
the City”) campaign, as he tries to 
visit every county in Iowa before 
the caucus. The Kings’ interest 
in politics has existed since the 
beginning, but it fails to justify 
why they took the time to have 
Peter run for president. It seems 
like the writers only included this 
arc in order to be timely and have 
sharp conversations about the 
issues and primaries, but overall 
it was just boring. The episode 
attempted to build drama from 
Peter’s mistakes and whether or 
not he’d be viable, but I felt noth-
ing watching the artificially-built 
turmoil. Even having “Charac-
ter Actress” Margo Martindale 
(“Justified”) isn’t enough to make 
the story viable. It’s OK for a show 
to experiment, but the show has 
dug its head in and kept going 
with a story which just doesn’t 
work.

The biggest reason why the 

political stories haven’t worked 
is that they keep Alicia separate 
from the lawyers at Lockhart, 
Agos & Lee. They are stuck in 
their own world, and it’s hurting 
the show. The artificial obstacles 
and stupid misunderstandings 
seem like the Kings are road-
blocking the characters into the 
separation, leading to storylines 
like David Lee (Zach Grenier, 
“Fight Club”) and Lucca Quinn 
(Cush Jumbo, “Getting On”) 
negotiating a prenup for How-

ard Lyman (Jerry Adler, “A Most 
Violent Year”) and Jackie Flor-
rick (Mary Beth Piel, “Dawson’s 
Creek”) a plotline which appears 
to exist only so contractual obli-
gations can be filled.

Every time I think the Kings 

are running out of steam, they 
pull out a scene like the epi-
sode’s opening. Still, it seems like 
they’ve forgotten what made the 
show great. It wasn’t the tackling 
of relevant issues or the political 
intrigue — it was the characters 
and the drama that came from 
their interactions. By throwing 
Cary and Diane into their own 
show and putting a heavy focus 
on a useless 2016 election story, 
it undermines those character 
moments. The Kings leaving could 
be a breath of fresh air should the 
show continue, as it would allow a 
new showrunner to return to the 
basics and put the focus back on 
the characters. However, it could 
also dig the show even deeper into 
the muck, and at that point the 
show might as well disappear.

A fantastic 

opening scene 
followed by 
political BS.

Gibson and EJ Womack helped 

lead 
the 
Washtenaw 
County 

elementary school kids through 
each activity. In an interview, 
Gibson said she wanted the 
children to think about why King 
is still celebrated today.

“I ask them to tell me about 

the person Dr. King was,” Gibson 
said. “Why is he so famous? One 
first-grader said ‘he went to jail 
a lot for breaking the law but he 
was doing it for the right reason.’ 
I was impressed. My mission is 
with the students, helping them 
understand why they are here.”

When asked what he had 

learned, 
10-year-old 
Amari 

Stevens from Bishop Elementary 
said he learned that he can do 
anything.

“I learned that anything is 

possible, and we are not afraid,” 
he said.

While 
Youth 
Day 
was 

underway, 
Nontombi 
Naomi 

Tutu 
delivered 
the 
annual 

keynote memorial speech in 
Hill Auditorium, which, for the 
first time, was broadcasted live 
to several watch parties across 
campus.

Several watch parties, hosted 

by campus groups such as the 
National 
Council 
for 
Negro 

Women (NCNW) and University 
Housing, offered a live broadcast 
for students and community 
members who were unable to 
attend the event in person at 
Hill Auditorium or wished to 
experience the lecture in a smaller 
setting.

Engineering 
junior 
Sindhu 

Sreedhar said the watch parties 
presented a unique opportunity 
for student discussion in a more 
comfortable setting. Sreedhar’s 
sorority, Delta Theta Psi, hosted 
a watch party at the Michigan 
Union. She said the symposium 
was especially meaningful to her 
as a member of a multicultural 
sorority.

“Issues of racism affect us too, 

and it kind of hits closer to home,” 
Sreedhar said.

Sreedhar 
added 
that 
she 

hopes students are able to make 
connections 
between 
Tutu’s 

speech and life at the University.

“Racism is very alive,” Sreedhar 

said. “But you don’t often see it, 
especially if you’re not the one 
being affected.”

While Delta Theta Psi hosted 

their watch party at the Union, 

the University’s section of the 
National Council of Negro Women 
hosted their own viewing at the 
Michigan League.

LSA senior Lania Robinson, 

a member of the University’s 
NCNW section, said the council 
helped organize the watch party 
because they were approached by 
the University and the event fits 
with the council’s mission.

“Based on our identities as 

African American women, MLK 
day is like something that’s really 
important for us to celebrate,” 
Robinson said.

Robinson added that she hopes 

that those who attended the 
watch party learned about the 
historical significance of racism 
and how it continues to affect the 
African American community on 
campus and across the nation.

“I hope that they kind of learn 

who has suffered in the past, 
and what that means for us as a 
community,” she said.

Across campus at the School 

of Public Policy, the Students of 
Color in Public Policy hosted their 
own watch party.

Public Policy graduate student 

Jacqueline 
Barocio 
said 
she 

decided to attend SCPP’s watch 
party because it offered a way to 
step out of the everyday routine 
and to examine how racism 
operates in modern society.

“You kind of forget that 

you exist in a larger social and 
political context,” Barocio said. 
“And 
re-examining 
my 
life 

opportunities and choices are 
a deep reflection of history and 
future social justice.”

Barocio said regardless of how 

society memorializes King, his 
work continues to this day.

“Such work still continues 

and is very apparent, and is 
still a primary goal for future 
generations, including myself,” 
she said.

Following 
the 
memorial 

lecture, several groups held events 
stretching into the afternoon. 
A seminar-based forum led by 
Honors Program residential staff 
in West Quad’s Connector sought 
to offer a space where students 
could reflect on Tutu’s remarks.

The 
discussion 
focused 

on 
inquiry-based 
prompts, 

asking 
participants 
to 
think 

about areas in which they felt 
social justice was important to 
them. Responses ranged from 
workplace experiences of racial 
discrimination to student stories 
of their peers’ micro-aggressions.

Discussion facilitator and LSA 

junior Lauren Tassone, an Honors 
Program 
residential 
advisor, 

said she and her peers wanted 
to facilitate a discussion that 
addressed issues of social justice 
and what an individual’s role is in 
social change.

“Today we really wanted to 

draw on what the speaker brought 
up, and we want to make sure we 
are a part of that conversation,” 
Tassone said.

Tassone said they wanted 

students to think about how they 
could become more active in 
social change, and how to address 
social issues for people of certain 
identities.

“How can we be allies to 

those who are victims of social 
injustice?” she asked.

LSA sophomore Cooper Agar, 

who attended the discussion, said 
he came because he was interested 
in how he should articulate ideas 
of social change.

Agar said though he had his 

own ideas on racial justice, he 
wasn’t sure how to express what 
he meant to say and thought the 
forum would provide a space 
where he could share his ideas.

“I thought that it would be a 

good way to continue that internal 
dialogue,” Agar said. “But also 
start an external dialogue.”

Agar added that he he hoped 

open dialogues like the West Quad 
forum would broaden student 
understanding of racial injustice 
and discrimination.

“I think what comes out of these 

discussions is an awareness,” he 
said. “And I think that awareness 
is what’s most important.”

After West Quad’s Connector 

Forum, 
over 
100 
supporters 

gathered in the Diag for the 10th 
annual 
Michigan 
Community 

Scholars Program’s Circle of 
Unity 
in 
commemoration 
of 

Martin Luther King Jr.

Largely facilitated by students, 

the event featured song and dance 
performances from members of 
the University and Ann Arbor 
community. The Michigan Gospel 
Chorale sang a rendition of “We 
Shall Overcome.” Local artists 
Joe Reilly played the guitar and 
performed self-compositions, one 
of which was titled “Unity Circle.”

Wendy 
Cortes, 
School 
of 

Social Work graduate student, 
also delivered a speech on how to 
effectively support the civil rights 
movement.

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Music Editor

I was lying in bed last night 

trolling through my phone’s 
songs on shuffle. My clock 
doesn’t move because it’s bro-
ken, but track by track, my 
phone reminded me it was 2 
a.m., 3 a.m., 4 a.m., and, now, 5 
a.m., when the roughly 1/5924 
chance of the unmistakeable 
banjo strums of “FourFiveSec-
onds” came through the speaker, 
filling my apartment.

The word “throwback” came 

to mind, but it stuck there with a 
tinge of bitterness. Throwback. 
“FourFiveSeconds,” 
the 
lead 

single for Rihanna’s forthcom-
ing album Anti was released on 
Jan. 24, 2015. Next Friday’s date 
is Jan. 22, 2016 (more on this 
later…).

Two months after “FourFi-

veSeconds,” we were blessed 
with “Bitch Better Have My 
Money,” and then came lacklus-
ter-at-best “American Oxygen.” 
Spring of last year, it felt like 
the world was Rihanna’s oyster. 
With three singles and rumors 
of a joint tour with Kanye West, 
it felt like it was going to be rain-
ing RihRih all summer long. 
Nonetheless, it has been a (his-
torically un)cold, long, Rihanna-
less winter.

She hasn’t left her fans all the 

way behind: a faint trail of videos 
alluding to a concept album have 
been laced throughout an online 
“AntiDiary.” 
Underwhelming 

in content, the site offers exclu-
sive tidbits for Samsung users 
and other videos, clues, etc. for 
the general public. I have yet to 
meet someone who knew about 
this before I told them. (Read: 
It’s going well. Everyone is on 
the edge of their seats.)

The rooms of the site are 

labeled “R1” through the “R8 
Bedroom,” the latter of which 
just so happens to be the only 
one left locked. That, combined 
with the excessive hashtagging 
of #R8 for the past year as a ref-
erence to Rih’s eighth album, 
leads to the conclusion that once 
the R8 Bedroom is unveiled, as 
will Anti.

Flashback to 5:21 a.m. on Sat-

urday Jan. 16, 2015.

Rihanna won’t be releasing 

her album tonight for its sur-
prise drop. The Sun feels too 
close, ya know? Next week, Jan. 
22, seems like the most viable 
option. Unreality UK added 
some backbone to the notion — 
however, it was also supposed to 
drop on Nov. 6, and then maybe 
again on Dec. 24.

On Jan. 29, Sia, writer of 

Rihanna’s 
“Diamonds,” 
and 

transcendent 
songstress 
of 

would’ve-been Anti track “Reap-
er,” releases her album This Is 
Acting. Rihanna won’t release 
hers the same week — that’d be 
a dick move.

There’s nothing inherently 

unlikely about Feb. 5 other than 
the fact that I want the release 
to be Jan. 22. The next week we 

will see Yeezy’s Swish, so that’s 
out. And if we get to Feb. 19, 
a mere 7 days before Rihanna 
embarks on her 69-show Anti 
World Tour, so help me God.

Rihanna 
wants 
her 
next 

album to be “timeless.” Do the 
singles feel timeless? Is Travi$ 
Scott to blame? Are they dat-
ing? Does this article read like a 
lot of fluff without much payoff? 
You now feel what it’s like to be 
a Rihanna fan on Jan. 16 at 5:35 
a.m.

On Nov. 23, 2014 a Michi-

gan Daily headline read, “Dear 
Rihanna, where are you?”

On Jan. 17, 2016, it reads: 

“What the hell, Rihanna?”

UPDATE: Rihanna shared a 

CBS promo on Jan. 16 for “Three 
Big Events” in which she and the 
NFL flip a coin (one side with the 
Super Bowl 50 logo, the other 
with a Grammy) to see who 
will go first on Feb. 7; she loses 
and says “I’m worth the wait.” 
Super Bowl 50 will be immedi-
ately followed by a live edition of 
“The Late Show” with Stephen 
Colbert. The 58th Grammys air 
Feb. 15. Will Rihanna release her 
album on Colbert? Possibly at the 
end of the show à la Miley Cyrus 
& Her Dead Petz at the VMAs? 
With Rihanna 8.0, one thing 
is for sure: without an album 
release prior to her seems-to-
be appearance at the Grammys 
(considering she isn’t nominated 
for a Grammy this year), it may 
just feel like another door open-
ing with nothing behind it.

When will Rihanna 
actually drop ‘Anti?’

NO FILTER

“

Children don’t know the 
meaning of yesterday, of 
the day before yesterday, or 

even of tomorrow, everything is 
this, now: the street is this, the 
doorway 
is this, the 
stairs are 
this, this is 
Mamma, 
this is 
Papa, this 
is the day, 
this the 
night.” 

Elena 

Fer-
rante, an 
acclaimed Italian author who 
writes under that pseudonym, 
intoned these words in “My 
Brilliant Friend,” the first story 
in her series the “Neapolitan 
Novels.” The series follows two 
girls, Lila and Elena, growing 
up in an impoverished neigh-
borhood of Naples, as they 
struggle for an education, are 
daunted and then intrigued by 
boys and yearn for a life outside 
of their community — really, 
as they come to grips with the 
complex truths of growing up 
as a girl.

I’m only on the second book, 

but what I’ve read has been lumi-
nous, quietly potent as Ferrante 
meanders through complicated 
lives — as a review in the Guard-
ian stated, “Nothing quite like it 
has ever been published.”

As important as I find these 

stories, I would have to disagree 
that they are the first of their kind.

I was a freshman in high 

school when I first learned the 
term “Bildungsroman,” coming 
from the mouth of an English 
teacher I idolized. A German 
word, clunky and unromantic, 
it’s used to describe a story sur-
rounding a character’s coming-
of-age. A story in which the 
greatest plot point is the main 

character changing and growing 
over the course of time. I was 
disappointed that such an unin-
spiring, sticky word described 
what was the most important 
genre to me when I was growing 
up, and to this day.

These were the books that 

had always captivated me: ones 
of slow growth and rich details, 
ones that allowed readers to 
dive into a character’s mind and 
watch as they changed and grew 
up. I had my favorites, the classic 
novels listed in the Bildungsro-
man Wikipedia entry: “Catcher 
in the Rye,” John Knowles’ “A 
Separate Peace,” even “Harry 
Potter.” Stories about boys, and 
about boyhood.

But two Bildungsromans in 

particular had entranced me 
from fifth grade on. I felt I was 
their girl protagonists, as they 
grew into women I dreamed of 
becoming. Both published in the 
early 1900s, neither “Anne of 
Green Gables” nor “A Tree Grows 
in Brooklyn” were lauded at the 
time of their release, but they 
sold well, and they still sell today. 
Stories of smart, sincere young 
girls growing up and navigating 
two distinct worlds. Both struck 
a chord with readers. Almost a 
century later, they struck a chord 
with me. I connected intimately 
with Anne and Francie, despite 
living very different lives from 
them — I saw shades of myself 
and the women I loved in them as 
they grew up.

So despite the Guardian’s 

pronouncement, Ferrante’s 
stories are not the only in their 
class, though the group is small. 
Anne from small town Canada, 
who over the course of 11 novels 
finds a family, a vocation, falls 
in and out of love, has children 
and loses one, is very different 
from “Brooklyn” ’s Francie — a 
girl growing up in impover-
ished Williamsburg, who has 

to face the dichotomy of honor-
ing her heritage and leaving 
the pain and poverty behind. 
Like Ferrante’s Lila and Elena, 
“Brooklyn” relays rarely repre-
sented expressions of girlhood 
as it makes its jumbled way into 
womanhood.

Books (or Bildungsromans) 

like “Gables” and “Brooklyn,” 
like the “Neapolitan Novels,” 
find ways to get inside the minds 
of young girls — laying anew the 
aching insecurities, the unwin-
nable competitions we are placed 
in, the sad importance men and 
boys have in shaping our self-
esteem. However, these stories 
go farther than just the univer-
salities of girlhood, using pains-
taking details to create fully 
developed lives. In the scope of 
great literature they may seem 
small, or irrelevant — relegated 
to the category of young adult lit, 
or worse, “women’s,” whatever 
that means. But their stories 
are inherently unique in how 
they create fully realized female 
characters rather than general-
ized tropes or bit parts. And 
unlike much of great literature, 
they are not focused on the cli-
maxes, on great acts of valor, on 
powerful figures, on sweeping 
virtuosos. They are about the 
daily walk to school, the boy 
met on a beach and then never 
seen again, the fight with a best 
friend, the small, unimpressive 
stories that fill the lives of girls 
and that are rarely given value. 
The little moments that create a 
life that make a person.

I haven’t finished Ferrante’s 

books yet, but I can’t wait to see 
what happens to Lila and Elena. 
That’s really all that great books 
are supposed to do to you.

Gadbois is inspired but skeeved 

by the term “Bildungsroman.”

In campus talk, prof. 
defends narcissism

By MARIA ROBINS-SOMER-

VILLE

Daily Arts Writer

Laura Kipnis, Northwestern 

University Communications Prof., 
told a crowd at the University 
today that she’s unafraid to ven-
ture into dialogue about touchy 
subjects — from pornography to 
what she has coined as “sexual 
paranoia,” which she says has 
washed over college campuses 
across the country.

Kipnis has published six books 

that mostly focus on discourse 
about gender/sexuality politics, 
love, sex, American popular cul-
ture and aesthetics through essays 
and anecdotes on her extensive 
experience and research as a 
video artist and cultural critic. 
Her recent essay “Sexual Para-
noia Strikes Academe” garnered 
uproar among the student body at 
Northwestern, resulting in a Title 
IX claim filed against her.

Kipnis spoke at Rackham Tues-

day to an audience composed 
partially of past and present 
members of the Michigan Soci-
ety of Fellows, a group that grants 
individuals who have demon-
strated excellence in various aca-
demic disciplines with three-year 
fellowships. During the event, 
she read from an excerpt of her 
upcoming book about narcissism.

“There is a rampant level of 

accusation about other people’s 
narcissism, and I guess it irks me 
in a certain way,” Kipnis said in 
an interview with The Michigan 
Daily. “I often find myself writing 
about things that irk me.” 

She added that narcissism had 

persistently come up in her travels 
and conversations, prompting her 
to write about it.

“At a certain point I just started 

thinking that everywhere I went 
and lots of conversations I was 
having and cultural criticism I was 

reading had to do with accusations 
about other people’s narcissism,” 
Kipnis said. “It’s always someone 
else who is a narcissist, not you.”

In the lecture, Kipnis excavated 

the rich history of narcissism in a 
way that touched on the evolution 
of the concept throughout history. 
She asked questions that would 
provoke the audience to revisit 
their attitudes toward the phrase 
and any aversion to identifying 
with it. She spoke about classifica-
tion of a narcissist in terms of self-
love; some say narcissists have an 
excess of self-esteem, where oth-
ers have argued that the narcis-
sist emerges from having too little 
self-esteem.

“There’s this really interesting 

history of who first gets diagnosed 
as a narcissist, who the term first 
gets invented about, which ends 
up interestingly being indepen-
dent women,” said Kipnis.

She explored the work of 

cultural historian Christopher 
Lasch, who wrote extensively 
on the ways in which American 
culture has the tendency to nor-
malize narcissistic behaviors. He 
saw himself as exempt from his 
own critique of narcissism, which 
was characterized by the blame 
of individuals for collective faults 
and bottomless repressed rage.

Kipnis also lectured on Sig-

mund 
Freud, 
unpacking 
his 

idea of primary narcissism — 
the innate self-involvement of 
infants that turns into secondary 
narcissism, an infatuation with 
the ego—now coined a narcis-
sistic personality. Kipnis posed 
the question of whether this 
increased self-love has devalued 
the ability to love others.

She additionally dove into dis-

cussion of the Narcissism Per-
sonality Inventory (NPI) — a test 
meant to measure quantity of 
narcissism in one’s personality. 
She suggested that the test was 
controversial as in what it truly 

measures, unclear, hard to agree 
upon and overused. Kipnis said the 
varying types of narcissism clas-
sifications she encountered in her 
research, from the “aggressive” to 
the “paranoid” to the “craving”, to 
the “phallic” to the “exhibitionist,” 
supported her claim that narcis-
sism in our world takes a myriad of 
forms and functions that encom-
pass more of our cultural identity 
than we’d like to admit.

Kipnis asked her audience to 

consider whether rampant narcis-
sism was a problem of competition 
for limited resources or simply the 
way we construct our character, 
summing up her points when she 
asked, “What are we entitled to?”

“Everyone’s ex is a consum-

mate narcissist,” she joked when 
exploring narcissism in the con-
text of romantic relationships.

In the Q&A portion Kipnis was 

questioned on the notion of “enti-
tlement” which she referred to as 
“demand on steroids” and a term 
that the right side of the political 
spectrum liked to throw around 
to describe those who expected 
different forms of government aid.

Kipnis’s tricky past of express-

ing discontent with the sexual 
politics 
on 
college 
campuses 

resurfaced when she responded 
to a question that asked whether 
entitlement came as an expecta-
tion to be protected from harm.

“I have to think more about 

that,” she said. 

Kipnis 
raised 
interest-

ing points and with thorough 
research, broadened the scope of 
the ways in which our culture has 
given in to self-interest.

“Rather than just point fingers 

at every one else, just take a look in 
the mirror,” she said on Tuesday.

Her statement, albeit jaded, 

held some truth yet left me hoping 
for a further investigation of the 
empathy, justice and compassion 
that any definition of narcissism 
fails to encompass. 

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

Stunning visuals and 
tense plot in ‘Theeb’

By JOE WAGNER

For The Daily

Theeb. Wolf. “(In Bedouin cul-

ture,) if someone calls you a wolf, 
you have earned their respect as 
a man of daring 
and cunning, a 
person who can 
achieve impos-
sible feats,” Naji 
Abu 
Nowar, 

director of the 
Jordanian film 
“Theeb,” wrote 
in his statement 
for Minnesota St. Paul Film Soci-
ety. “The wolf is an ambiguous 
creature both revered and feared, 
it is both a pack animal, loyal to 
its tribe, and a strong individual 
capable of existing by itself.”

Nowar’s directorial debut is a 

compelling, sometimes confusing 
reinterpretation of the western 
genre, interlaced with a Bildung-
sroman narrative. The cast is 
composed entirely of nonprofes-
sional actors with the exception 
of Jack Fox (“Blood Moon”). The 
film, set in 1916, takes place in the 
beautiful Arabian landscape of 
the Wadi Rum desert, which at 
times seems to evoke the classic 
Western location of Monument 
Valley.

Theeb (Jacir Eid Al-Hwietat), 

the protagonist of the film, is 
given his name at birth, which 

means that greatness is expected 
of him. At its core, “Theeb” is a 
story of boy who must live up to 
these high expectations. A boy 
who must become a man.

Theeb and his brother Hus-

sein (Hussein Salameh Al-Swei-
lhiyeen) have recently lost their 
father, the leader of their tribe. 
When Edward (Jack Fox), an 
Englishman, and Marji (Marji 
Audeh), an Arab, visit Theeb 
and 
Hussein’s 
encampment 

seeking refuge and guidance 
through the desert, the brothers 
accept the request out of honor 
for their deceased father. Hus-
sein, an expert navigator of the 
area, is asked to guide them to a 
well along a pilgrims’ trail near 
the Ottoman railroad. The trail 
is rumored to have more raiders 
than pilgrims.

Despite the complaints of 

Edward and Marji, Theeb joins 
the group, eager for adventure 

and wanting to spend time with 
his brother. The rumor of dan-
ger comes to fruition when they 
arrive at the well, where they 
are ambushed. During an intense 
Western-style shoot-out, lives 
are lost and Theeb must work 
together with one of the murder-
ous raiders to survive the treach-
erous Wadi Rum desert.

“Theeb,” with its stunning 

landscape shots and anxiety-pro-
voking story, is an adventure film 
that is, at the least, entertaining. 
The skeleton survival tale of the 
plot is easily accessible with its 
primal urgency. However, the 
details, which make films real-
ly come alive, lack clarity. For 
example, why does the English-
man travel alone? Why is he visit-
ing different wells? Perhaps, with 
greater knowledge of the Middle 
Eastern theatre of World War I 
or a better understanding of Bed-
ouin culture, the film’s subtleties 
would be more comprehensible. 
Yet for the lay-viewer, these ques-
tions are left unanswered.

Still, the story of a boy becom-

ing a man is timeless and relat-
able. In a year riddled with 
survival films (like “The Rev-
enant,” “The Martian” and “Mad 
Max: Fury Road”), “Theeb” man-
ages to hold its own by playing 
with genre and telling a story 
from a people whose views are 
rarely depicted on the screen.

Michigan comeback, 

postgame fight 
culminate series 

split with Buckeyes

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Editor

If an opposing team gives the 

Michigan hockey team’s offense 
opportunities to score, chances 
are the Wolverines will make 
them pay.

And 
that’s 
exactly 
what 

Michigan did Sunday evening.

With just 52 seconds gone in the 

third period and the Wolverines on 
a two-man advantage and down by 
two goals, freshman forward Kyle 
Connor received a cross-ice pass 
from junior forward Tyler Motte 
and buried the puck past Ohio 
State goaltender Matt Tomkins.

Just 50 seconds later, Motte 

was on the receiving end of a big 
rebound from Tomkins and slid 
it under the netminder to even 
the game.

Less than two minutes after 

that, Motte scored again for his 
third goal of the game, and the 
Wolverines 
didn’t 
look 
back, 

cruising to an 8-6 win Sunday at 
Yost Ice Arena that saw 84 penalty 
minutes handed out after the final 
buzzer sounded.

As soon as the game ended, 

a brawl broke out in front of 
Michigan goaltender Steve Racine 
that saw sophomore defenseman 
Cutler Martin sucker punch Ohio 
State forward Brendon Kearney.

Martin 
was 
handed 
a 

disqualification, which means 

he will be suspended at least 
one game.

Sophomore forward Dexter 

Dancs 
was 
also 
given 
a 

disqualification 
while 
junior 

forward Alex Kile was given a 
game misconduct for leaving the 
bench.

The brawl ended what was an 

exciting game from start to finish. 

Unlike Friday’s game, when 

Michigan went down 3-0 before 
mounting 
a 
comeback, 
the 

Wolverines came out of the gate 
strong.

It paid off just 1:45 into the 

game, when sophomore forward 
Tony Calderone found freshman 
forward Brendan Warren all 
alone in the slot. Warren took 
Calderone’s pass and one-timed 
the puck past Tomkins for his fifth 
goal of the year.

“It was good to see Brendan 

Warren score a goal tonight,” 
Berenson said.

Ohio State tied the game up 

when Buckeye forward Dakota 
Joshua grabbed his own rebound 
and put the puck past senior 
goaltender Steve Racine.

But as they have done all 

season, the Wolverines answered 
quickly.

Just 36 seconds after the 

Buckeyes’ equalizer, freshman 
forward Kyle Connor found junior 
forward Tyler Motte on an odd-
man rush. Motte’s first attempt 
was saved, but Tomkins could not 
deny Motte and he roofed it over 
the netminder’s left shoulder.

Ohio State responded, though, 

winning another scrum in front 
of Racine. This time, Racine was 
on his back without his stick as 
trailing Buckeye forward Tyler 

Lundey chipped the puck over the 
sprawling netminder to knot the 
game at two going into the first 
intermission.

But as well as Michigan came 

out in the first period, Ohio State 
came out even faster in the second.

Just three seconds after the 

puck was dropped to start the 
beginning of the second period, 
senior forward Justin Selman went 
to the penalty box for high sticking 
and the Buckeyes capitalized.

After some nice passing down 

low, Ohio State forward Matthew 
Weis found David Gust across the 
crease, where Gust tapped home 
his sixth goal of the year.

But it didn’t stop there for the 

Buckeyes. Two minutes later, Ohio 
State defenseman Sasha Larocque 
found himself wide open in the 
slot and buried a shot past Racine.

Michigan got a goal back when 

Connor collected his own rebound, 
rounded the net and beat Tomkins 
glove side, but the Buckeyes 
answered with another power-
play goal from forward Mason 
Jobst to restore the two-goal lead.

“(Ohio State) skated well,” 

Berenson said. “I thought they 
played really well. They attacked 
well with the puck. They’re a good 
hockey team, and they’re a fast 
hockey team. They had us on our 
heels for half of the game.”

After the Wolverines’ scoring 

spree to start the third period, 
sophomore forward Dexter Dancs 
added his fifth goal of the year and 
Compher scored on an empty net, 
while Ohio State forward Kevin 
Miller tacked one on late to round 
out the scoring.

While Racine allowed six goals,

Fan provides sendoffs to remember

T

he physical act of going on 
the road, generally, creates 
little fanfare for Michigan 

teams. Sure, the football team’s 
fans frequently fill opposing 
stadiums, but the team departs 
Schembechler Hall the day before 
games with a police escort devoid 
of much of the rah-rah “Go Blue” 
fandom exhibited in Michigan 
Stadium. The men’s basketball 
team doesn’t have a fan presence, 
either, as it departs the William 
Davidson Player Development 
Center for road trips. 

The Michigan women’s 

basketball team, however, has a 
very different experience. It has 
Chuck Raab. 

To call Raab — a recently 

retired special needs teacher who 
lives in Ann Arbor — a Michigan 
fan would be an understatement. 
He is the most diehard of the 
diehards, a guy who bleeds so blue 
a smurf would be impressed. 

He grew up watching Red 

Berenson and Cazzie Russell 
play for Michigan, and at times 
over the years, he has been a 
fixture at different Michigan 
sporting events, from football to 
women’s rowing. But now, Raab 
puts most of his time and energy 
into supporting the women’s 
basketball team. 

For most, supporting any 

athletic team is a part-time hobby, 
reserved for watching games 
and keeping up to date with 
news involving the team. Raab’s 
support goes well beyond that. 

He stood on Stadium 

Boulevard on Saturday, right by 
the Player Development Center, 
Crisler Center and Michigan 
Stadium as the team began to load 
its bus to the airport for its game 
against Penn State. 

He was armed with a large 

Michigan flag and a sign that 
read, “Michigan Wolverines never 
stop.” When the bus prepared to 
leave the parking lot, Raab placed 
the handle of his flag in a cone 
sitting nearby. He grabbed his 

sign as the bus passed by, jumping 
up and down to show the players 
and coaches. Then, as the bus 
headed down Stadium toward the 
Big House, Raab dropped his sign 
and snatched the flag. 

He sprinted alongside the bus 

until it was completely out of sight. 
He yelled words of encouragement 
the entire time. He does the same 
thing every time the Wolverines go 
on the road.

 “I want to support the team as 

it’s leaving for an away game just 
to show them that we the fans 
support them wherever they’re 
playing, wherever they’re going,” 
Raab said.

His support and steadfast 

encouragement don’t go 
unacknowledged by the team. 
The players and coaching staff 
waved to Raab as he executed 

his sendoff, and many of the 
players give him high-fives as 
he screams and hollers when 
they run onto the court for home 
games. At games, Raab is a ball 
of enthusiasm, 
using his front-
row seat as a 
way to be close 
to the action 
and constantly 
yell words of 
support.

If Raab’s 

excitement 
about Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
seems unusual, it’s because it is.

Historically, the program 

hasn’t enjoyed a great deal of 
success. The Wolverines have 
never reached the Sweet 16 in the 

NCAA Tournament, and black 
curtains rope off the upper-level 
seats for home games. The team 
has drawn more than 3,000 fans 
to a home game only once this 

season, despite 
an 11-6 record 
in a year when 
rebuilding 
was the sole 
expectation.

Those 

facts do not 
dampen Raab’s 
enthusiasm. 
He has long 
been a fan 
of Michigan 

women’s basketball, but his 
current level of devotion began in 
2003 with the arrival of former 
coach Cheryl Burnett. 

Raab remembers Burnett 

pleading with the team’s fans 
to be more passionate about the 
team. He took it as a call to action.

He decided he would support 

the team in every way he possibly 
could. He bought a season-ticket 
courtside seat that he holds to 
this day, decked himself out in 
Michigan clothing and started 
making signs to hold at games. 
He’d show up when the team 
went on road trips, too, cheering 
them on the entire way.

He hasn’t looked back, 13 

years later. His repertoire of 
signs is constantly changing 
and growing. He showed up to 
Thursday’s home game against 
Maryland with nine handwritten 
signs, all giving his favorite team 
messages of encouragement. 
He even shows up sometimes 
when the team gets back to Ann 

Arbor after road games, like 
he did Sunday night after the 
Wolverines downed Penn State 
in State College.

Raab sees a program on the 

rise, one led by what he believes 
is the best coaching staff in the 
country. If the team is working 
so hard, Raab believes, then the 
fans should be working hard to 
support them. 

“I want to help create this kind 

of atmosphere around the court 
to give our women — which they 
richly deserve — the best home-
court advantage in the country,” 
Raab said.

Raab hardly ever misses a game 

or seeing the team off for a road 
trip, estimating that he misses 
seeing the team bus depart once 
a season, but only if he has a very 
important conflict.

He was slowed down by a 

battle with stage IV Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma for a couple of years 
after 2011, and then again with 
a more recent melanoma scare. 
He was disappointed, even in 
the midst of extremely serious 
health problems, that he couldn’t 
support the team the way he 
wanted to.

 “It’s my passion,” Raab said. “I 

just want to do whatever I can to 
support the team. It’s not about … 
it’s nothing about me. It’s about 
the team, the team, the team. I’m 
just trying to support the team, 
the team, the team.”

For now, Raab may very well 

be the team’s most passionate fan. 
But if someone surpasses him one 
day, it seems like Raab wouldn’t 
mind. He might even prefer it. 

“Every year, I just dream about 

the day when we can fill this 
whole arena up and everybody 
(can) be that passionate and give 
us that home-court advantage,” 
Raab said before Thursday’s 
game. “That is my main goal.”

‘M’ holds on at Penn State

Wolverines hit free 
throws down the 
stretch, rebound 

from Thursday loss

By LELAND MITCHINSON

Daily Sports Writer

Though the Michigan women’s 

basketball team seemed to be 
in control for most of its game 
against 
Penn 
State 
(1-5 

Big 
Ten, 

6-11 overall) on Sunday, it took 
everything the Wolverines had 
to hold on for a 91-87 victory on 
the road.

Composure from the free-

throw line and the team’s ability 
to get the ball into the hands 
of sophomore guard Katelynn 
Flaherty, who was 9-for-10 from 
the stripe on the night, kept 
Michigan (3-3, 11-6) a step ahead 

in its first win in State College 
since 2001.

Despite allowing Penn State 

to close the gap, Michigan 
turned in a strong defensive 
performance in the first half, 
limiting the Nittany Lions to 
just 37-percent shooting from 
the floor. The Wolverines turned 
it up a notch to begin the third 
quarter, stretching their lead to 
15 at one point, in large part due 
to the fact that Penn State had 
no answer for Thome in the post 
and in transition.

Freshman 
center 
Hallie 

Thome finished the contest with 
18 points, five rebounds and four 
blocks, though she fouled out 
with 2:03 left in the game.

Fouls were a problem for 

both teams as junior guard 
Siera Thompson joined Thome 
in fouling out, committing her 
fifth in the last minute of the 
game, and the Nittany Lions also 
had three players reach the foul 
limit.

Flaherty found her groove 

in the second half to make up 
for it, leading the Wolverines in 
scoring with 23 points for the 
game, which included 4-for-5 
shooting from 3-point range.

Penn 
State 
made 
it 

uncomfortable 
for 
Michigan 

late, going on a 7-0 run with 
four minutes left in the fourth. 
The Nittany Lions continued to 
claw their way back, cutting the 
Michigan lead all the way down 
to five with only a minute left. 
The charge was led by guard 
Teniya Page, who finished the 
game with 31 points, though the 
Wolverines were able to avoid a 
big collapse on the road, relying 
on late free throws to shut Penn 
State’s window of opportunity.

“I thought Penn State did a 

tremendous job of fighting and 
fighting and battling back,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “Every time we got up 10 
or 12 points they would make 
another run.”

“We’ve lost three games that 

have come down to this and we 

didn’t make our free throws 
down the stretch, so tonight it 
was great to see.”

After the game began with 

a nearly two minute scoreless 
streak 
by 
both 
teams, 
the 

Wolverines found their stride, 
benefitting from strong first-
quarter performances by Thome 
and Thompson, who combined 
for 15 points on the way to a 23-14 
lead for Michigan.

Leading by nine to start the 

second quarter, the Wolverines 
turned 
to 
their 
bench 
as 

starters Thome, Thompson and 
Flaherty each picked up two 
personal fouls.

The foul trouble, along with 13 

turnovers, allowed the Nittany 
Lions to cut their deficit to four 
at the half.

“Our 
turnovers 
were 
so 

unforced at times,” Barnes Arico 
said. “They were in transition 
when we had numbers and we 
had opportunities … so that 
will be something that we’ll 
definitely emphasize.”

Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico’s team pulled out a close victory over Penn State on Sunday, led by sophomore guard Katelynn Flaherty’s 23 points.

WOMEN’S TENNIS
Michigan rolls in 
first tournament

By ORION SANG

Daily Sports Writer

The No. 14 Michigan women’s 

tennis 
team 
struggled 
with 

injuries during the fall season, 
with 
many 
lineup 
regulars 

unable to play.

But 
this 
weekend, 
with 

everyone healthy and back in 
the mix, the Wolverines showed 
little sign of rust, competing in 
their first tournament since the 
end of the fall season as they 
hosted No. 23 Georgia Tech, 
North Florida and Tennessee for 
the Michigan Invitational at the 
Varsity Tennis Center.

Led by strong performances 

from sophomore Alex Najarian 
and freshmen Brienne Minor 
and Kate Fahey, Michigan was 
able to win the majority of both 
its singles and doubles matches 
over the weekend.

Both Najarian and Minor won 

all three of their singles matches, 
while Fahey won each of her 
doubles matches.

“We got a lot of quality, tough 

matches,” Bernstein said. “They 
were put in a lot of difficult 
situations — you saw a lot of 
tiebreakers today and big points. 
Overall, I think it was the 
perfect weekend to get us ready 
for next weekend.”

Friday, the Wolverines got 

off to a sluggish start in doubles 
play, dropping three out of four 
matches against the Yellow 
Jackets, 
but 
Bernstein 
was 

unconcerned with her team’s 
slow start.

“With 
the 
new 
doubles 

(rules), 
everything 
happens 

pretty quick, so we just need to 
be ready,” Bernstein said. “We 
had new teams — a couple of the 
kids in doubles hadn’t played in 
the fall. After that first round, I 
had a feeling that we would be 
OK and that we’d settle down. I 
think as the weekend went on, 
the doubles definitely picked up.”

Michigan proved Bernstein 

right 
by 
improving 
from 

their inauspicious start to the 
tournament. 
The 
Wolverines 

swept Tennessee in three doubles 
matches before later winning all 
seven singles matches against 
North Florida to close out the 
first day.

Michigan 
continued 
its 

success from the previous day 
on Saturday, winning three of 
four doubles matches against 
the Volunteers and all three 
of its doubles matches against 
the Ospreys. The Wolverines 
continued 
the 
momentum 

forward, winning five of their 
eight singles matches against 
Georgia Tech.

The last day, though, proved 

to be the toughest competition 
for the Wolverines in singles 
play, as they split eight matches 
with Tennessee.

Minor was broken several 

times in the first set of her 
match against Sadie Hammond 
at the third singles position, but 
came back to win the first-set 
tiebreaker. She went on to win 
the second set, 6-3, to finish off 
her perfect performance over 
the weekend.

“I thought I did well in singles 

and doubles overall,” Minor said. 
“I’m feeling pretty good going 
into season.”

Both Fahey and Najarian 

were in similarly tough matches, 
as Fahey dropped a highly 
contested first set en route to 
a 5-7, 1-6 loss. Najarian, on the 
other hand, battled her way to a 
7-6, 7-5 victory.

Bernstein was pleased with 

the mental toughness her team 
showed.

“You don’t always feel your 

best or play your best,” Bernstein 
said. “But you have to figure out 
a way to compete, and I think we 
did a good job of that.”

The Wolverines will look to 

continue their hot start next 
week at the ITA Kick-Off.

“I 
definitely 
think 
(this 

weekend) 
gave 
us 
some 

momentum,” Minor said. “I 
thought our whole team has been 
playing well, even though some 
of us lost. I think we’re all ready 
for the season.”

he stopped 43 Buckeye shots to 
earn his eighth win of the season.

The first line of Compher, 

Connor 
and 
Motte 
finished 

with a combined 12 points and 
accounted for six of Michigan’s 
eight goals.

“They’re playing the right 

way,” Berenson said. “They’ve got 
confidence, they’ve got chemistry, 
and they’re leading our team.”

Earlier this year, Compher 

said Michigan didn’t want to be 
known as the “comeback kids.” 
But the team’s inconsistent play 
has forced it to be just that.

And somehow, they’re getting 

by quite well.

“It’s 
old 
time 
hockey,” 

Berenson said. “We’re trying 
to play better defensively, but 
that’s what you get tonight. They 
had too many shots, too many 
chances. We had 40 shots against 
after two periods tonight. That’s 
unacceptable, but that’s the way 
the game is played.

“If it snows out, you have to 

deal with it.”

Top line dominant vs. Buckeyes

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan hockey team 

entered Value City Arena in 
Columbus on Friday night as close 
to perfect as it had been all season.

The Wolverines were coming 

off 
back-to-back 
weekends 

that featured a Great Lakes 
Invitational title and a series 
sweep against Michigan State.

Michigan notched its two 

victories against the Spartans in 
a commanding fashion, recording 
its largest series goal differential 
of the season — finding twine 15 
times while conceding just five 
goals on the defensive end.

But the Wolverines’ two-game 

stint against Ohio State ended in 
a different fashion: with players 
from both sides trading blows at 
Yost Ice Arena in a fight that is 
rare in college hockey.

The brawl was emblematic 

of 
Michigan’s 
experience 
all 

weekend. The Buckeyes repeatedly 
put the Wolverines on the ropes, 
mercilessly landing shots that 
would reduce most teams to an 
embarrassing two-loss weekend.

Each time Ohio State had 

seemingly locked down an upset 
victory, though, Michigan was 
saved by the play of its first line.

That line — comprised of 

junior forward JT Compher, 
junior forward Tyler Motte and 
freshman forward Kyle Connor 
— combined for nine of the 13 
goals the Wolverines scored this 
weekend, leading them to a tie 
Friday and a victory Sunday.

“I don’t have to give them a 

message,” said Michigan coach Red 
Berenson. “They’re leading our 
team, and good for them. You need 
somebody, or a group, to really lead 
your team — particularly when you 
get behind.”

The sheer total of goals the first 

line scored isn’t even what’s most 
impressive about its performance 
this weekend. Instead, Motte, 
Compher and Connor seemed to 
have the clutch gene in their DNA 
against the Buckeyes, lighting the 

lamp just when Michigan needed 
it time and time again.

Just over a minute into the 

third period Friday, Connor 
sniped a one-timer past Ohio 
State netminder Matt Tomkins to 
extend Michigan’s unanswered 
scoring run to three.

After allowing three straight 

goals to open the game, Connor’s 
finish was a key one — providing the 
Wolverines with an opportunity to 
play the third frame as if it were a 
brand-new game.

Though Michigan went on to 

let a win slip through its fingers 
on a defensive zone faceoff with 
seven seconds to play, Connor’s 
goal was the spark that allowed 
the Wolverines to be in a position 
to steal three points from the 
Buckeyes.

The freshman rounded out the 

weekend with two more goals 
Sunday, both of which trimmed 
Ohio State’s lead to one. Connor’s 
second goal of the night came just 
52 seconds into the third period 
and led to the four consecutive 
finishes 
that 
left 
Michigan 

standing on top.

With his three-goal weekend, 

Connor is now tied for first in the 
NCAA in goals this season with 18.

As if an offense that scores an 

NCAA-high 4.86 goals per game 
isn’t scary enough, Motte is one 
of the three players Connor is 
tied with in the category.

The Buckeyes had no answer 

for Motte on Sunday, as the 
junior forward notched his first 
career hat trick to close out the 
series, and had an assist to go 
with it.

Like Connor, Motte found the 

back of the net at moments that 
entirely shifted the momentum of 
the contest — tallying a go-ahead 
goal in the first period before 
burying an equalizer and another 
go-ahead in the third.

“For me, it’s just working with 

these guys,” Motte said. “They 
make it pretty easy on me, getting 
me the puck in prime scoring 
areas. The timing of them just 
happened to be (go-ahead and 
tying goals) tonight.”

And then there’s the captain.

Compher 
didn’t 
endlessly 

pepper the back of the net like 
his two line partners, but he did 
add a pair of goals for himself. 
The more important of those two 
came Friday.

With the score sitting at 4-3 and 

just 2:41 remaining on the game 
clock, Compher held the puck 
behind the goal line searching 
for an opening before cleverly 
banking a shot off the goaltender’s 
back and into the net.

And while Motte and Connor 

may be leading the NCAA in 
goals, they can largely thank 
Compher for that.

The junior has been the 

maestro behind the offense all 
year, racking up 25 assists in 21 
games — good for second in the 
NCAA in that category.

“I think since (our line has) 

been put together, we just move 
the puck well,” Compher said. 

This weekend, the Wolverines 

were very far from perfect.

But with the first line they 

have, maybe, imperfection will 
do for now.

Wolverines rally, 
knock off Illinois

Michigan leans on 
back end to beat 

second consecutive 
ranked opponent

By NATHANIEL CLARK

Daily Sports Writer

Once 
again, 
the 
No. 
10 

Michigan wrestling team found 
itself trailing a ranked opponent 
in the second half of a meet. And 
once again, the Wolverines rallied 
to win. 

Michigan 
defeated 
No. 
13 

Illinois, 25-14, and erased a 14-8 
deficit with four matches to go. 
The Wolverines’ victory comes 
directly on the heels of a 21-11 
triumph over then-No. 6 Ohio 
State on Jan. 9 — a meet in which 
Michigan trailed, 11-9, after the 
sixth bout.

“If we’re coming in at 184 

(pounds) and the dual is tied, 
we’re going to win the dual,” said 
sixth-ranked, 197-pound, sixth-
year senior Max Huntley. “There 
was no way that we were going to 
lose two of the three (matches) at 
that weight class.”

It all started in the 174-pound 

class when redshirt freshman 
No. 
16 
Davonte 
Mahomes 

earned a 12-3 major decision 
over Emery Parker. Mahomes 
scored 
five 
takedowns 
and 

accumulated 1:39 of riding time 
during the bout.

“At the 174 (pound) match, 

I looked at the scoreboard 
and said, ‘we have to win this 
match,’ ” said Michigan coach 
Joe McFarland. “It was good to 
see (Mahomes) go out there and 
really take control and dominate 
that match.”

The Wolverines took the lead 

when No. 10 junior Domenic 
Abounader 
earned 
two 

takedowns in the third period en 

route to an 8-2 victory over Jeff 
Kopke at 184 pounds. 

But it was Huntley who sealed 

the match for the Wolverines. 
He pinned Jeff Kopke 2:39 into 
the match to give Michigan an 
insurmountable 21-14 edge. No. 4 
junior heavyweight Adam Coon 
put the cherry on top, earning an 
11-2 major-decision win against 
No. 19 Brooks Black.

“We’re getting the work done 

in the practice room and it’s 
showing up on the mat,” Coon 
said. “We’re definitely happy 
with our performances, but we’re 
never satisfied.”

Yet 
Michigan’s 
final 
four 

wrestlers were not the only ones 
to shine Friday. No. 19 redshirt 
junior Conor Youtsey opened the 
meet with a 25-10 technical-fall 
victory over Francis Edelen at 125 
pounds. The performance gave 
the Wolverines a 5-0 lead at the 
time.

In spite of the win, there were 

a few moments Michigan would 
probably like to forget. 

In the 157-pound class, No. 5 

junior Brian Murphy suffered 
a technical-fall defeat at the 
hands of No. 1 Isaiah Martinez 
4:44 into the bout, turning 
an 8-6 Wolverine lead into 
an 11-8 deficit. Also, redshirt 
sophomore George Fisher lost 
his match against Brock Ervin, 
8-6, which gave the Fighting 
Illini a 6-5 edge.

With a matchup against No. 1 

Penn State on Jan. 31, as well as Big 
Ten and NCAA championships 
looming, McFarland was quick to 
point out areas where Michigan 
needs to improve.

“In some cases, we allowed 

guys to slow us down,” McFarland 
said. 
“We 
want 
high-paced, 

inspired wrestling. We have guys 
who are capable of doing that, 
but right now we don’t have all 10 
guys doing that. We need to get 
there.”

Wolverines fall short at Windy City Invite

Michigan finds room 

for improvement 
after Big Ten foes 
dominate meet

By COLE ZINGAS 

Daily Sports Writer

At the Windy City Invitational 

in 
Chicago 
on 
Sunday, 
the 

Michigan men’s gymnastics team 
lined up against five top-16 teams, 
hoping to establish legitimacy as a 
national contender. 

But 
after 
the 
meet, 
the 

Wolverines’ first of the year, 
they returned to Ann Arbor 
dissatisfied. For Michigan, a fifth-
place finish in a six-team field did 
not sit well. 

The fifth-ranked Wolverines 

(1-4, 0-4 Big Ten) ended up 
behind four other Big Ten teams 
— No. 2 Ohio State, No. 6 Illinois, 

No. 8 Minnesota and No. 9 Iowa 
— finishing with a 413.700 team 
score. That put them 12.250 
points behind the Fighting Illini, 
who edged out Ohio State by .250 
points to win the meet. 

Senior captain Nolan Novak 

addressed the team after the meet, 
telling them to remember the 
feeling they had at that moment. 

“We need to attack each 

practice with that feeling in our 
gut and say, ‘I don’t want to feel 
that way ever again,’ ” Novak said.

But the end result was not 

representative of the beginning 
of 
the 
competition 
for 
the 

young Michigan squad. To start 
the meet, freshmen Anthony 
MacCallum and Emyre Cole and 
junior Anthony Stefanelli took 
to the vault and finished second, 
third and fifth, respectively. 

They all scored a 15 or higher, 

and in Michigan coach Kurt 
Golder’s opinion, the routines 
should have been scored even 

higher.

“The first team up normally 

gets lower scores, then the judges 
get loosened up as the meet goes 
on,” Golder said. “I think they 
were real tight on us in some 
vaults.” 

Nevertheless, the Wolverines 

won the vault team event by 1.5 
points, a wide margin for a single 
event.

But after that, the team was 

shaky, showing its inexperience 
and youth in events such as the 
pommel 
horse, 
parallel 
bars 

and high bar. Michigan finished 
second to last in all three of those 
events. 

Part of the reason could be 

because 
several 
Wolverines 

had to face new challenges in a 
meet Novak called a “learning 
experience.”

Novak competed in the high 

bar for the first time Sunday. 
Freshman Matt Whitaker, an 
alternate, was slotted for the 

parallel bars at the last minute. 
Sophomore 
Marty 
Strech 

competed in the all-around for the 
first time in his Michigan career 
and seven freshmen competed in 
their first collegiate meet. 

But to Golder, having an 

inexperienced team means there 
is much more potential to improve 
than other top-10 teams. 

“If (Michigan) met Utah in 

football at the end of the season, 
we would have beat them,” Golder 
said. “Hopefully that will happen 
with our team.”

Though the Michigan football 

team never got another crack at 
the Utes, the men’s gymnastics 
team will face the top two teams 
from Sunday, Illinois and Ohio 
State, again later in the season. 

“We’ve got some pretty darn 

talented 
guys,” 
Golder 
said. 

“They’re certainly going to be 
scoring a lot higher at the end of 
the year than they are right now.” 

Golder said the vault team is 

already realizing its potential, but 
the floor team is also very talented 
and did not show what it’s capable 
of Sunday. He also foresees 
improvement 
in 
the 
parallel 

bars, which was the Wolverines’ 
downfall this weekend. 

Michigan is now determined to 

make these improvements. After 
falling to three teams ranked 
below them, the Wolverines know 
they need to perform better in 
order to reassert themselves as 
one of the nation’s teams to beat.

“This is going to fuel the fire 

for the rest of the season,” Novak 
said. “We have more motivation 
than anyone else because we have 
a lot more to prove.”

Michigan hopes to ignite that 

fire very quickly, as five days of 
preparation is all the Wolverines 
have before their next meet. 
Saturday, they will have a prime 
opportunity to prove themselves— 
they will take on No. 1 Oklahoma 
at Cliff Keen Arena.

‘M’ falls at Iowa

By LEV FACHER

Daily Sports Writer

IOWA CITY — The Michigan 

men’s basketball team provided 
further nightmare fodder Sunday 
for 
one 

former 
secretary 
of 
state, 

proving repeatedly that leads in 
Iowa are never secure, even for 
hometown favorites.

Twice, 
the

allowed themselves to fall behind 
substantially 
and 
seemingly 

for good in front of 15,400 at 
Carver-Hawkeye 
Arena. 
But 

twice, Michigan brushed its past 
Hawkeye State woes aside and 
refused to let the game slip out of 
reach until the final minutes of its 
82-71 loss at No. 16 Iowa.

The Wolverines (3-2 Big Ten, 

13-5 
overall) 
weathered 
the 

Hawkeyes’ 9-0 run to open the 
game and again recovered from 
a deficit that ballooned to 12 
midway through the first half, 
even taking a two-point lead with 
15:24 remaining in the game. 

“We 
were 
really 
happy 

with 
this 
(performance),” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
John 

Beilein, 
citing 
the 
daunting 

road environment, which was 
impressive especially given the 
sub-zero temperatures outside. 
“They did show a lot more than 
they did in a couple other games.”

The 
third 
blow, 
however, 

proved too hard to recover from, 
as a 3-pointer from Peter Jok with 
8:55 remaining put the Hawkeyes 
(5-0, 14-3) up by 11. The Wolverines 
threatened once again, trimming 
Iowa’s lead to as little as five, but 
ultimately left their comeback 
trifecta incomplete.

Michigan 
struggled 
to 

contain Jok and Jarrod Uthoff 
throughout, in no small part due 
to its shooting ability and knack 
for 
consistently 
finishing 
in 

transition. Uthoff finished with 
23 points, and Jok added 16.

“Transition defense is really 

hard when you have five shooters 
(on offense),” Beilein said. “There 
were a couple of times there when 
we had bad matchups. (Junior 
forward) Mark Donnal all of a 
sudden is over on Jok. That’s 
bad anyway, let alone if you’re 
running down the court trying to 
identify him.”

The Wolverines’ transitional 

woes proved a consistent thorn 
in their side, but the root of the 
problem — their inability to 
handle Iowa’s defensive pressure 
— seemed to bother Beilein more. 
Michigan turned the ball over 13 
times, including three consecutive 
possessions once Iowa began 
applying a 2-3 zone press.

The 
Hawkeyes’ 
pressure 

was hardly a surprise, and the 
Wolverines 
even 
used 
their 

press break to their advantage 
in Tuesday’s win over No. 3 
Maryland, taking the opportunity 
to 
find 
redshirt 
sophomore 

guard Duncan Robinson alone 
on the perimeter. Robinson even 

expressed excitement prior to 
the Iowa game that Michigan 
could replicate the performance 
— 
provided, 
of 
course, 
the 

Wolverines could get the ball up 
the court.

All in all, the Wolverines did 

well to pick off one game in their 
10-day devil’s row — a visit to 
then-No. 20 Purdue, a matchup 
with No. 3 Maryland and, finally, 
the visit to No. 16 Iowa. Playing 
without senior guard Caris LeVert, 
the centerpiece of their offense, 
the Wolverines nonetheless kept 
things close in both of the losses 
and manufactured more than 
enough offense to finish the upset 
over the Terrapins.

But in January, when it came 

to Big Ten standings and NCAA 
Tournament resumes and the 
harsh reality of back-to-back road 
losses setting in, Walton provided 
no excuse.

“We didn’t really want to do 

moral victories,” Walton said. “It’s 
not what we do.”

Lineup changes not 
enough for Michigan

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Editor

IOWA CITY — With Caris 

LeVert still sidelined with a lower 
left leg injury, the Michigan 
men’s basketball team searched 
hard for a winning combination 
against No. 16 Iowa on Sunday. At 
times, the Wolverines even used 
redshirt freshman forward D.J. 
Wilson and true freshman Moritz 
Wagner — two big men who don’t 
often see the court, let alone see 
it at the same time — to get some 
momentum going after falling 
into an early 11-0 hole. 

Michigan coach John Beilein’s 

meddling was to no avail, though, 
and the Hawkeyes (5-0 Big Ten, 
14-3 overall) handily beat the 
Wolverines, 82-71. 

“They 
were 
the 
better 

team than us tonight, without 
question,” 
Beilein 
said. 
“We 

fought hard; we had three really 
bad spurts during the game. At 
the beginning of the first, three 
quarters of the way through the 
first half and three quarters of the 
way through the second.” 

Beilein orchestrated multiple 

comebacks from Iowa’s spurts, 
including a 13-0 run in the first half 
that was a result of lineup changes. 

 Redshirt sophomore guard 

Duncan 
Robinson 
started 

Michigan’s (3-2, 13-5) run by 
driving to the basket rather than 
hitting his signature 3-pointer. 
After Robinson led the way, 
Wagner and sophomore forward 
Aubrey Dawkins followed up with 
inside layups of their own. 

The 
run 
was 
accentuated 

further by back-to-back dunks 
from Wagner and Wilson. 

Wagner grabbed a defensive 

rebound after the Wolverines’ 
nine-point spurt, gave it to junior 
guard Derrick Walton and ran 
to the other side of the court. 

Meanwhile, Walton dribbled it all 
the way around the perimeter and 
passed to Dawkins, who dished it 
back to Wagner in the paint for a 
two-handed slam.

 Dawkins did such a good 

job with his assist that he was 
beckoned over to the sideline with 
the clock still running to give 
Beilein a hug. 

The play was part of a vital 13-0 

run that gave Michigan a one-point 
lead, 21-20, with 8:11 left in the first 
half. The lineup for a majority 
of the run included Walton, 
sophomore guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman, Dawkins, 
Wilson and Wagner. 

“The length that we tried to get 

to get a bigger hand up on a few 
of their guys, but they ended up 
going with four or five shooters 
out there,” Beilein said. “We’re 
just trying to find ways to get D.J. 
on the floor.” 

Added junior forward Mark 

Donnal: “Overall, I think they did 
a good job of playing their role,” 
Donnal said. “We run (Wilson 
and Wagner) at that position 
during practice all the time. It’s 
not something that we’re not used 
to seeing, but I guess in games you 
don’t necessarily see it (often).” 

Michigan started off the second 

half with a Robinson 3-pointer 
less than a minute in. Robinson 
jumpstarted a 13-6 run at the start 
of the second that led Michigan 
to regain a lead after heading into 
halftime down 38-33. 

Abdur-Rahkman proved he 

could work the inside against 
the Hawkeyes in the second 
frame, 
consistently 
breaking 

through the zone and laying the 
ball in while still under the net 
— sometimes while in reverse 
and without looking — but also 
proved himself as a perimeter 
threat. A little less than four 
minutes into the second half, he 

stepped back and hit a three to 
put Michigan within one point of 
the Hawkeyes, 47-46.

“We 
saw 
how 
deflated 

(previous opponents’ runs) looked 
or felt,” Walton said. “We really 
wanted to make that adjustment 
that even though teams are gonna 
make runs, don’t hang your head, 
the game is full of runs. Today, 
Iowa made their run and nobody 
on this team watched. We were 
just really eager to make the next 
play for our teammates.” 

But after the spurt at the start of 

the second half, it was hard to keep 
up with the Hawkeyes. Beilein 
tried the combo of Wagner and 
Wilson again, along with Walton, 
Dawkins and junior forward Zak 
Irvin, but fault lines were more 
noticeable this time around.

Ten minutes into the second 

half, a ball hovered around the 
rim, and after Wilson grabbed the 
offensive rebound, he should have 
tipped it in but couldn’t. Thirteen 
seconds 
later, 
Beilein 
pulled 

Wilson and Wagner. Beilein’s 
experimenting was over.

The missed tip-in was part of a 

12-0 Hawkeye run that stretched 
over four minutes. It ended when 
Donnal made a layup, but the 
game was too far gone.

Though the contest in Iowa 

City was full of small Michigan 
achievements, 
moral 
victories 

aren’t enough anymore for the 
Wolverines. 

“Of course, we don’t really 

want to do moral victories, that’s 
not what we do,” Walton said. 
“But as a good basketball team 
in this conference, we gotta pay 
homage to this team, it’s really 
good. This three-game stretch 
to play some of the top teams in 
this conference, we stood toe-to-
toe some stretches, we never let 
down, but I think we can only get 
better from this point.”

SWIMMING AND DIVING
Wolverines show 
depth in the pool

By ANNA HARITOS 

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
men’s 
and 

women’s swimming and diving 
teams 
opened 
the 
semester 

Saturday with a sweep of the 
competition at a quad meet against 
Indiana, Duke and Georgia Tech, 
held at Georgia Tech.

The 
meet 
offered 
the 

Wolverines 
a 
particular 

advantage for later in the season. 
The Yellow Jackets will host the 
NCAA Championships this year, 
so Michigan will be familiar with 
the site when the event comes 
around.

“Coach (Mike) Bottom went 

out of his way to set up a meet at 
Georgia Tech so we could get a 
feel for the pool before we went 
to nationals,” senior Ali DeLoof 
said. “It’s really great he did that 
because we can work on turns, 
starts and really get a feel for the 
pool before we get to nationals.”

The victory was well earned by 

both teams, as they each kicked 
off the meet by dominating the 
200-yard medley relay. Indiana 
proved to hold some of the 
toughest competition, but the 
Wolverines were better.

“Indiana won their share of 

events, but the events that they 
won, we were able to take second, 
third, fourth and add up points 
that would take away some of 
their advantage for the overall 
win,” Bottom said. “It was a great 
team win on both sides.” 

On the women’s side, DeLoof 

and sophomores Clara Smiddy 
and Gillian Ryan as well as 
freshman 
Siobhan 
Haughey 

each claimed wins in two events. 
Smiddy finished with two ‘B’ cut 
times in the 100-yard backstroke 
and the 200-yard backstroke. 
Meanwhile, Ryan dominated the 
field in the 1,000-yard freestyle, 
winning by more than 10 seconds.

They were not the only ones 

who led the team to victory, as 
the Wolverines (4-0 Big Ten, 6-1 
overall) showed depth in many 
events, especially the 200-yard 

freestyle, in which they took first, 
third, fourth and fifth. 

The men’s team continued 

to uphold its undefeated dual-
meet record this past weekend, 
as it has not lost a dual since 
November 2010. 

Much like the women, the men 

(4-0, 7-0) showed strong depth 
in their events. Sophomore PJ 
Ransford won the 1,000-yard 
freestyle with junior Cameron 
Stitt taking second and sophomore 
Ian Rainey placing fourth. 

The 
500-yard 
freestyle 

also provided points for the 
Wolverines. Senior Anders Lie 
Nielsen took first followed by 
Ransford in second, while their 
teammates, Stitt and Rainey, took 
fourth and fifth, respectively. 

Among the standouts was 

sophomore 
Paul 
Powers, 
a 

Georgia native, who won the 
50-yard freestyle.

“That was my home pool where 

all my state championships were,” 
Powers said. “Along with a bunch 
of other important meets as well. 
The pool itself carries a lot of 
really good memories, and I think 
just swimming there once before 
nationals is going to be such a help 
to the entire team.”

Though 
the 
scores 
show 

Michigan’s dominance, skill and 
focus, the Wolverines fought hard 
until the last athlete touched the 
wall in the 400-yard freestyle to 
end the meet. Both the men and 
the women claimed first in the 
event and the meet overall — but 
for the men, the final race was a 
huge determining factor in the 
outcome.

“A lot of times in a dual meet, 

it comes down to the last race,” 
Powers said. “That relay carries 
so many points with the win that 
it can be a crucial point, especially 
if you’re a lot closer than you 
think it is. We were really close 
with Indiana pretty much the 
whole meet. Going into the 400-
yard relay, we knew that we had 
to win it in order to win the meet. 
We ended up pulling through, 
and that was incredible.”

Freshman Olivia Karas earned her first all-around title Saturday against Ohio State with a dominant performance and an overall score of 39.425.
Newly crowned No. 1 Michigan wins

Wolverines top 
Ohio State in 

Autism Awareness 

Meet at Crisler

By ETHAN WOLFE

Daily Sports Writer

In its first meet ranked at 

the top of women’s college 
gymnastics, No. 1 Michigan had 
no problem proving it deserved 
the ranking.

The 
Wolverines 
(1-0 
Big 

Ten, 4-0 overall), who hosted 
their second annual Autism 
Awareness Meet on Saturday, 
beat Ohio State (0-1, 1-1) handily, 
196.950-195.275. Michigan has 
lost just once to the Buckeyes in 
its last 48 meetings.

Freshman 
Olivia 
Karas 

headed 
the 
Wolverines’ 

dominant performance with a 
score of 39.425 and her first all-

around victory as a collegiate 
gymnast. Karas also claimed the 
best score on the vault, 9.875, 
and scored no lower than 9.825 
in any event.

“We put in a lot of hard work 

this week, and I think it really 
showed,” Karas said. “It’s great 
to win all-around, but our team 
won and that’s the bottom line. 
We put out a great performance.”

Junior captain Nicole Artz 

continued 
her 
fantastic 

season, 
winning 
the 

floor 
exercise 

with a score 
of 9.900. That, 
alongside 
stellar 
performances 
in 
her 
other 

events, 
gave 

her a score of 39.375, putting her 
right behind Karas for the best 
all-around score.

But Karas and Artz weren’t 

the only ones who shined for 
Michigan.

Senior 
captain 
Briley 

Casanova had a career day, 
tying career highs of 9.825 and 
9.850 on the bars and vault, 
respectively. Freshman Emma 
McLean tied her career high for 
the vault with a 9.775.

Junior captain Talia Chiarelli 

received the honor of Big Ten 
Event Specialist of the Week 

for the third 
week in a row. 
She 
posted 

the 
highest 

score in any 
event for the 
meet, earning 
a 9.950 on the 
beam.

In all four 

events, 
the 

Wolverines 

earned more than 49 total points 
out of a possible 50.

Michigan coach Bev Plocki 

believes the Wolverines’ success 

is a result of the team becoming 
more comfortable and confident 
with each meet.

Artz 
agreed, 
adding 
that 

being ranked first in the country 
is no surprise to her.

“We know that we are where 

we belong, and that we are No. 
1,” Artz said. “To finally have 
that recognition is awesome.”

Added Karas: “I think this 

is 
(a 
championship 
team). 

Everyone on this team has what 
it takes to contribute, and we’re 
definitely going to be contenders 
for nationals this year.”

Plocki 
also 
thinks 
that 

Wolverines 
can 
win 
a 

championship. 
When 
asked 

if 
Michigan 
is 
a 
national 

contender, 
Plocki 
answered 

without hesitation.

“Absolutely,” she said. “I say that 

with absolutely no reservation at 
all. This team has shown so much 
resiliency and grit. This is going to 
be a team that will be able to go all 
the way for sure.”

“We know that 
we are where we 
belong, and that 

we are No. 1.”
