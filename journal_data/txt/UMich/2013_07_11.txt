.M' could make millions after dynamic pricing

Because they stand to make $5
million.
Any more questions why the
Michigan athletic department
shouldn't implement dynamicticket
pricing for football tickets?
Last week, Michigan announced
that all single-game football tickets
would be subject to a new dynamic-
ticket pricing policy - which will
determine the price of the ticket
based on the demand for the ticket.
The policy will only affect single-
game tickets and not season tickets
or student tickets.
"Dynamic pricing is a practice
that hasbecome standard across the
sports and entertainment industry
after gaining acceptance through
airlines and hotels," said Hunter
Lochmann, chief marketing officer
for Michigan Athletics, in a state-
ment to the athletic department.

But just how much of a difference
will the policy have on ticket prices?
Endzone tickets for games
against Notre Dame or Ohio State
are already projected to cost more
than $100 from a standard $65 tick-
et and could go for more. The esti-
mated total revenue for the athletic
department is $5 million, according
to Jesse Lawrence, a contributor to
Forbes and founder of TiqIQ - a
live-event ticket-pricing aggrega-
tor and search engine that provides
flexible buying and selling options.
Nearly 80 percent of ticket
sales go to students and alumni,
according to Lawrence, leaving
21,700 available seats, or 20 percent.
Michigan estimates that intial
dynamic price of tickets could range
from no increase - like Sept. 14
against Akron - or a $130 increase
- like Sept. 7 against Notre Dame.
"They (the consumers) are going
to pay more anyways," Lawrence
said. "It's just a auestion of who's

making the money? Is it the school
or is it the broker?"
The athletic department is set to
release tickets on July 31to the pub-
lie, at which point it could decide to
withhold a percentage of those tick-
ets for a later time. Lawrence said he
estimates that the athletic depart-
ment could make up to another mil-
lion dollars should they hold on to
the tickets while the price goes up.
"If they wanted to be as greedy as
possible, they probably would have
jacked it up higher than that," Law-
rence said. "The market would have
dictated that the demand would be
enough to absorb the prices."
Both Lochmann and the athletic
departmentdid notestimateon new
revenue, since the number of tickets
available is unknown. However,
Lochmann said in an interview
with Crain's Detroit Business that
he expects less than 10,000 single-
game tickets to be available.
"We'd be happy if we netted
over $1 million," Lochmann said to
Crain's.
Dynamic pricing was used origi-
nally by entertainment and hotel
industries before it expanded into
sports, where teams from the NFL
to Major League Soccer make use of
the computer program's input.
Michigan will use QCue, a
computer program that "determines
what drives sales using variables
such as start time, opponents, etc.
to set more accurate prices from the
onset and maximize demand across
the house."
Professional sports teams like
the MLB's New York Mets or the
NBA's Atlanta Hawks, among many,
use QCue to capture opportunities
to raise prices.

The University of California, one
of the first collegiate programs to
implement dynamic pricing, also
uses QCue to suggest ticket prices.
The University of South Florida and
Georgetown Universityuse dynam-
ic ticket pricing as well.
On Monday, Purdue University
announced that it too would use
dynamic pricing for football season.
"One of our guiding principles is
to drive change and innovate and in
this case, it's a win-win," Lochmann
said to The Daily. "Creating extra
value for our season ticket holders
and also creating mre revenue
to support our 900-plus student-
athletes across 31 teams."
The use of dynamic pricing is
expected to help athletic depart-
ments, much like professional
teams, recuperate profits lost to sec-
ondary ticket markets like StubHub

or Ticketmaster. According to the
athletic department, an aggregate
of secondary market average ticket
prices for the same endzone seats
against Notre Dame cost as much as
$133 more as of June 26.
Michigan is the second most
valuable football program accord-
ing to Forbes, worth a $120 million.
Only Texas, worth $133 million, is
valued to be more. Lawrence said
he believes the additional revenue
would be enough to make the Wol-
verines the most valuable program.
"There's so much money to be
made in the whole college football
ecosystem that to think that they
would not maximize revenue is
a bit naive frankly," Lawrence
said. "It is business, even though
it's a collegiate program. They're
obviously dedicated to making as
much profit as possible."

Supreme Court
to rule on cases
involving 'U'
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily Staff Reporter
This fall, the U.S. Supreme
Court will hear a new case
regarding affirmative action
in Michigan, Schuette v.
Coalition to Defend Affirmative
Action. The case, to which the
University is a party, has the
potential to have sweeping
effects for both the standing
of popular referendum and
affirmative action policies
across the nation.
The Michigan Civil Rights
Initiative, a state constitution-
al amendment that outlawed
the use of race, gender, and a
number of other factors in col-
lege admissions, was adopted
with 58 percent of voters for
the measure. However, the
Michigan Civil Rights Corm-
mision, then chaired by now-
re gent Mark Bernstein (D -Ann
Arbor), alleged a campaign of
disinformation and deception
by proponents of the MCRI. In
Augiut 2006, a District Court
judg - ruled that supporters
of th MCRI had "engaged in
systematic voter fraud by tell-
ing voicr, that were signing a
petition ,upporting affirma-
tive acti:!,,' but refused to
remove it from the ballot since
the MCRI's supporters had not
technically violated the Voting
Rights Act of 1965.
After the passage of the ini-
tiative, a group of University
students and faculty filed a suit

Starbucks and Au
Bon Pain will join
other Union eateries
By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
Daily News Editor
On Monday morning, Univc'r-
sity Unions announced that cafs
Starbucks and Au Bon Pain would
replace Amer's Mediterranean Deli
and the University Club, respective-
ly, at the Michigan Union.
In late April, University Unions
announced the final list of tenants
that would occupy the Michigan
Union's ground floor court, Michi-
gan Union Grill. While Wendy's,
Subway and Panda Express would
continue to serve the Union - with
Wendy's and Subway expanding -
Pizza Hut, Mrs. Fields, Freshens
and Auntie Anne's faced expiring
leases. Ahmo's Gyro and Deli would

also be moving into the MUG.
Changes hit above ground as well.
As the winter semester wound down
to a close, so did Amer's tenancy
in the first floor of the Michigan
Union. The announcement also
marked the close of the University
Club, a sit-down restaurant located
also on the first floor.
The University Club began
operation in 1937, providing
students with healthy alternatives
to fast food lunch options. In a
University press release, Susan Pile,
director of the Michigan Union,
cited a diminishing customer base
and faltering revenues as reasons
for the Club's closing.
Pile said she believed that the
Club no longer met "the needs
of today's students," because
sit-down lunches did not appeal
to the contemporary student
lifestyle. Moreover, she noted that
the University Club model did not
"allow the spaceto be more used

by students," as the Club space was
primarily limited to lunch hours
and other selective events.
"We really feel thatthis is actually
going to allow for a much more
interactive and engaging kind of
space through all hours of the day
than we've had in the past," Pile said.
She added that the cafe would
maintain a performance area so
programming and events - such as
weekly poetry slams and acoustic
performances - could continue to
take place.
The Michigan Union Board
of Representatives, the selection
committee for the prospective
Union tenants, was impressed
by Au Bon Pain's success around
other college campuses and their
provision of detailed nutritional
charts. The Boston chain is
known for its fast-service soups,
sandwiches and breakfast entrees
and its ready-made deli selections.

Classes provide
opportunity for
public access to
higher education
By WILL GREENBERG
Daily Staff Reporter
While the average student
'raverses the Diag between classes,
a new generation of students can
simply navigate with a mouse and
a keyboard.
In April of 2012 the University
announced its partnership with the
online course company Coursera
and in July of that year began
offering free 'massive open online
classes' to individuals seeking an
:ducation without the University
price tag.
The courses are not intended
to serve as a replacement for the
traditional education experience
and thus do not offer credit but
instead award a certificate of
completion.
Coursera currently offers 395
online courses and has a total
enrollment of over four million.
The website has partnered with 83
educational institutions including
Northwestern University,
University of Maryland, University
of Minnesota, Ohio State

Jay-Z falls short a
mediocre 'Grail'

like he's struggling to keep up.
But overall, the consistency just
isn't there. While Kanye West's
perfectionist approach clearly
pushed Jay-Z to his pinnacle
on the joint venture Watch The

seem to leave a deep impression
on Hov, tempting the mainstream

waterfalls along the way. But
without Kanye's guiding hand,
Jay trades the risk of greatness
for widestream acceptance.
Because of this, MCHG is
a very good, very traditional
hip-hop album. It falls short,
however, because today's Jay-Z
lacks the emotional investment
pervading his previous work.
Despite a life of pure luxury,
Jay tries to convince us that he's

demonstrate Jay-Z's strained
attempts to stay relevant.
But this strain makes more

But at the end of the day,
Jay had to stop listening to the

some lyrics down.
And with a contented bravado

ultimately moving onto the next

that Jay-Z is perfectly content to
just make a run for it every now

back by his utter complacency.

as more and more questions pile
up, Korsyn will post response

"I think that instructors need

also true for live lectures that have

Professor aids in carbon-dating project
to monitor illegal elephant poaching

By STEVEN TWEEDIE
Daily TV/New Media Editor
Jay-Z's 12th studio album,
Magna Carta... Holy Grail, has
arrived with the polished sheen
of a birthday present you enjoy
for a few months and then quickly
forget.
"We should make like four
more, since we've got time,"
Jay-Z says in a Samsung promo
for MCHG, suggesting to
contributing producer Timbaland
that they should crank out some
more tracks. "I think I'm ready
now - like before was just the
warm-up."

Well, not exactly.
The best part of MCHG is
its grounded production, and
unfortunately the worst part
is Jay-Z. Glimmers of intense
effort from the album's producers
thankfully make up for the sheer
lyrical laziness on Jay-Z's part,
and somehow this unbalanced
cocktail results in a host of good
- but not great - tracks.
Jay-Z has both the influence
and money to enlist the help of
hip hop's most celebrated sound

Research requires
more funding
to have forensic
applications
By TUI RADEMAKER
Daily NewsEditor
New research by a team that
includes Paleontology prof. Daniel
Fisher could apply carbon-dating

methods used to study prehistoric
animals to fight modern-day
elephant poaching.
Using standard carbon-14 dating
methods on seized ivory tusks,
Fisher and his colleagues can now
predict the date of an elephant's
death, indicating whether or
not the material was extracted
before the ivory trade was banned
in 1975. Kevin Uno, a former
researcher at the University of
Utah, is the lead author of the
paper detailing the discovery.

The illegal ivory trade is one that
has seen significant growth in the
past several years as demand in
Asiahas increased. Thure Cerling, a
geology professor at the University
of Utah who worked with Fisher
on the project, said some estimates
predict that the illegal trade
could amount to a billion-dollar
underground market.
"There are now something
like 30,000 African elephants
a year that are being killed by
poachers," Fisher said. "'It's really

a serious problem. And that's from
a population of only a fewhundred
thousand and so at this rate they
could be in really dire straits."
The carbon-dating used by
the research team relies on
changing carbon-14 levels in the
atmosphere. Cerling said that in
the 1950s and 1960s the U.S. and
the Soviet Union both engaged in
numerous above-ground nuclear
weapons tests which doubled the
atmosphere's carbon-14 levels.

Former Borders Books building
to welcome many new tenants

Self-titled album
finds R&B star at her
shimmering best
By KAYLA UPADHYAYA
Managing Arts Editor
For some reason, Ciara has
never received .the commercial
success her talent warrants -
whether from
mismanage- -
ment, poor tim-
ing, adverse pop 1"a
trends or, most Ciara
likely, all of the
fucking above. Epic
But through it
all, Ciara's self-confidence has

always been the cornerstone of
her music.
Clara's latest eponymous
release - her most concise and
coherent album to date - oozes
with the confidence that has
yielded some of her best work. A
three-word review of Clara might
look something like: "Needs.
More. Ballads." "Body Party"
- the best R&B slow-jam since
Usher's "Climax" - is the obvious
crowning jewel, and it's hard not
to crave more of the trickling,
electro-backed ballads we fell in
love with back in 2006 when CiCi
gave us "Promise."
But still, it's hard to complain
about an album so full of intoxi-
cating spunk. CiCi's at her best
when she's at her most self-pos-

sessed, and on Clara, she knows
exactly who she is. She occasionally
shows her more tender side, as on
the shimmering lead single "Body
Party." Other tracks explode with
her ferocity, and sometimes both
sides collide. On the super-layered
"Super Turnt Up," synths trill
and steely beats pound, and Ciara
throws smooth, swaying vocals on
top of it all, only to transition three
minutes in to a snarling rap that'll
have you gettingyour stank face on.
Ciara's self-assurance gives
way to girl-power anthems, like
in the male-gaze rejection "Keep
On Lookin"' or "Read My Lips,"
a buoyant summer jam entirely
dedicated entirely to cunnilingus
(!!!). CiCi enters full HBIC-mode
on the swagger-filled revenge ode

Several restaurants
to occupy vacated
Liberty St. corner
By WILL GREENBERG
Daily StaffReporter
Though the building that
housed Borders Books on East
Liberty Street now features
boarded-up windows and ongoing
construction, the space will soon
be home to several new restaurants
and offices.
Five new restaurants will move
into the first floor, while Prime
Research and the University's
School of Information will occupy
the second floor.
The 44,000 square-foot building

is currently undergoing extensive
interior and exterior renovations
to accommodate the new tenants,
including the addition of an
entrance on Maynard Street and
walls to divide the newbusinesses.
Brendan Cavender of Colliers
International - the company
representing the building owner
- said construction would be
completed in time for tenants to
move in September.
5,296 square-feet of the
property have been leased to
Takashi Yagihashi, a chef who
fuses Japanese and French cuisine
and has owned and run multiple
restaurants across the country.
Yagihashi, who spent nine years
in Ann Arbor, will open another
location of the Slurping Turtle, a
sit-down ramen restaurantbased in

Chicago.
Joining the Slurping Turtle will
be Knight's Steakhouse, which
is opening its second Ann Arbor
location. Owner and manager Don
Knight said he looks forward to
sharing the space with Yagihashi
and other restaurants within the
complex.
"(It's) a win-win for both of us,"
he said. "Think of the car industry:
they put everything right next
to each other and people tend to
flock to places where there's more
options."
The last three restaurants that
will join Knight's Steakhouse and
the Slurping Turtle have yet to be
named.
Prime Research, a strategic
communication research firm, will
take 20,000 square-feet on the

second floor. Cavender said the area
has become a popular location for
technology companies as they are
able to find a large pool of young
talentcomingoutof the University.
Despite Prime Research
predominantly operating remotely
through the Internet and news,
Julie Beach, senior accounting and
human resources manager, said
Ann Arbor was chosen as a strategic
location for the business.
"Here at Prime Research, having
a good education is important and
so. obviously having our business
in a town that is located nearby the
University of Michigan was one of
the big pushes for us to originally
choose Ann Arbor for our North
American operation," Beach said.
East Liberty Street has seen 10
businesses close in the last two

years, raising the question of the
viability of openingabusiness there.
Cavender said he is not worried
about these new businesses seeing
success, as many of the recent
closures were due to factors besides
location.
"We track volumes of sales
figures of all the other restaurants
down there and all of them are very
healthy," Cavender said. "It was
easx to blame Borders when they
closed for the decline but in my
opinion that's not what closed these
otherbusinesses."
Don Knight said he was
enthusiastic about the location, as
the area has been making a come
back.
"More people are getting up
there," Knight said. "They don't just
stick to Main Street anymore."

Decreasing dumping
State should protect environment by increasing fee
M ichigan is known for its many lakes and dense for-
ests - and to some, its remarkably cheap landfills. At
the moment Michigan's tipping fee -the cost the state
charges to dump trash in Michigan landfills - is only 21 cents per
ton, which is remarkably low when compared to its neighbors. The
corresponding fee in Wisconsin is $12.99, and just over the Canadian
border Windsor charges a whopping $64. Michigan's low tipping fee
is a cause for concern, as it encourages other states and Canada to
shunt their trash into Michigan. Since so much of Michigan's iden-
tity as a state is based in its natural beauty and the state is always
in need of more money, Governor Snyder and the state legislature
should raise the tipping fee in order to preserve the environment.
Moreover, they should also take a variety of steps to ensure that as
little recyclable material as possible finds its way into landfills.

Two years ago, after the verdict
was released in the infamous
Casey Anthony trial, Facebook
and Twitter
suddenly exploded
with millions of
newly minted
criminal justice
experts writing
things like, "Well,
our justice system
certainly has a JAMES
lot of flaws," and BRENNAN
asking questions
like, "What kind of
country are we where someone who is
clearly guilty walks free?" The same
will probably be said of some other case
where the jury ends up disagreeing
with whatever decision the media lays
down before all the facts are en, but that
is criminal justice in America.
One of the most vital aspects of our
criminal justice system - as defined
through hundreds of 'years of both
English and American common law -
is the presumption of innocence until
guilt is proven. In a criminal trial, the
judge will instruct the jury that, unless
the prosecution has proven guilt of
the defendant beyond any reasonable
doubts, the defendant can't be found
guilty. In our criminal justice system,
the entire burden of proof rests on the
prosecution - the defense does not
have to prove innocence. Our culture
outside of the courtroom, however, is
far different.
In a world of perp walks, Court TV,
talking heads and social networks -
where everyone finds their inner legal
expert - all the key aspects of the
greatest justice system developed are
tossed aside in favor of sensationalism
and mistruth. Sir William Blackstone,
in his 1765 work "Commentaries on
the Laws of England," wrote the now
famous expression, "the law holds it
better that 10 guilty persons escape,
than that one innocent party suffer."
Blackstone's "Commentaries" is one
of the single most influential pieces of
writing when it comes to American
law, as many of our founding fathers
and earliest judges and lawyers were
trained under the ideals he expressed.
The very foundation of criminal law is
that justice should be served, but under
no circumstances should a punishment
be served to an innocent person. This
means every so often, a guilty man
may walk free. Our justice system isn't
perfect, but neither are any others.
The criminal justice system doesn't
become an abysmal failure when some-
one like Casey Anthony or O.J. Simpson
walks free. The criminal justice system
truly fails when millions of young men

and women are sent to jail for petty, non-
violent crimes, ruining their chances of
regaining a normal life. The criminal
justice system truly fails when the death
penalty remains in existence despite
hundreds of innocent people being put
to death or scheduled to be put to death
based on shaky evidence. The criminal
justice system trul fails when those
who are rich and powerful regularly
skirt justice while the poorest in society
are given underpaid, overworked public
defenders and forced into guilty pleas.
Everyone finds
their inner legal
expert.
In the U.S., the number of incarcer-
ated citizens per capita is higher than
anywhere else in the world - even more
so than China, Cuba and Iran. The only
country that may come close to the U.S.
is North Korea, where the numbers are
unknown. Even then, some estimates
still have the U.S.-as number one when
it comes to prisoners per capita - even
ahead of the most notoriously abusive
communist regime in the world. Fur-
thermore, the only three countries in
the world with a higher number,of exe-
cutions in 2011 than the U.S. are China,
Iran and Yemen. Even Saudi Arabia - a
country under Sharia law- executes
fewer people than the U.S.Ourcriminal
justice system, on paper, should be the
brightestbeaconof freedom and democ-
racy that we have to offer, built on a
fair and balanced system of laws and a
refusal to convict the innocent. Instead,
it has been transformed into a menac-
ing, horrific monsterwillingto imprison
the poorest and weakest among us.
In the next year or two, National
Football League player Aaron Her-
nandez may go to trial for the murder
charges he currently faces, and if he
does,itwiflcertainlybe oneofthe most-
covered cases in recent memory. If,
by some chance, the man is acquitted,
save your fingers the typing - it's not
because he's famous. If anything, his
ability to afford a good lawyer, the fact
that he appears white, and weak evi-
dence - not his celebrity - is what may
acquit him. A football player getting off
on murder isn't the crux of what's wrong
with criminal justice in the U.S., despite
what your aunt says on Facebook. The
real problem is, well, everything else.

01' Dirty Maste of a1Es
Reflecting on
'Tears for O'D.B.'

With the current tipping fee,
about 20 percent of the solid
waste disposed of in Michigan
landfills last year came from
out of state. Since it's so low to
begin with, raising the tipping
fee would likely increase the
amount of revenue the state
gets while simultaneously act-
ing as a disincentive for other
states (or countries) to cart
their trash all the way to Mich-
igan for disposal. This would
not only lengthen the life of
Michigan's existing landfills,
but could also encourage other
state governments - includ-
ing our own - to consider pro-
grams that would reduce the
amount of trash produced in
the first place and in the future.
One way to do this would be

to expand the bottle deposit
program. Currently, there are
no deposits on disposable water
bottles and other beverage con-
tainers - such as energy drinks
and Arizona iced tea cans -
that are as large or larger than
the 12oz cans and 20oz bottles
that currently have deposits.
Seeing as Americans consume
about 38 billion disposable
water bottles each year and
only 38.6 percent of disposable
water bottles were recycled in
the U.S. in 2011, such a measure
is sorely needed. Additionally,
the state should encourage cit-
ies and local governments to
provide recycling receptacles
for public use alongside trash
receptacles, akin to the ones
found on campus in the Diag

and elsewhere. Placing recy-
cling cans next to trashcans
makes recycling incredibly
easy. The state could also con-
sider incentivizing businesses
- particularly those that sell
canned beverages - to provide
recycling containers for their
customers' use.
Allowing trash to be import-
ed into Michigan puts the
quality of one of this state's
greatest assets - its environ-
ment - at risk. By raising the
tipping fee for garbage, offer-
ing a deposit for a larger vari-
ety of drink containers and
making recycling receptacles
more commonly available, the
state would both make money
and lessen the need for more
landfills in the long run.

POACHING
From Page 2
Since the testing was
discontinued, the levels have been
declining due to the balancing
effect of the world's oceans and
ecosystems. These trackable
changes give researchers like Fisher
'd'd Cerling clues as to when layers
of ivory were formed.
"What we do is take a small
sample of that material bordering
the base of the tusk (and) measure
the amount of carbon-14 in that
sample using accelerator mass
spectrometry," Fisher said.
"In certain circumstances that
measurement all by itself may be
enough to determine the date of
death of the animal."
The individual testing of samples
from seized ivory shipments costs
about $500, Cerling said. However
he said this is a small price to pay,
considering both the magnitude
of the poaching problem as well
as the millions of dollars that are
associated with the illegal industry.
However, cost is also what is
preventing the research from going
any further. Cerling said a lack
of funding has stopped the team
from applying their carbon-dating
method to suspect ivory outside the
laboratory.
-Yet Cerling says they must
continue to pursue funding as the
poaching problem persists. Just
last week, five tons of ivory worth
$20 million in the Philippines was
seized, he said.

Fisher said up until now, it's been
nearly impossible to convict ivory
smugglers because they can claim
that the ivory was extracted before
the bans in 1975 and 1989. But
this carbon-dating method could
provide evidence against them.
"You find the shipper and you say
'so what's up with these tusks in the
clothing (shipment)' and they say
'oh oh yeah yeah well we had some
space in the shipment. No need to
worry aboutthatthat's old ivory....so
it's perfectly legal' and we say'hmm
we'll see about that'," Fisher said.
George Wittemyer, a professor
of ecology at Colorado State
University who is involved with the
study and has conducted extensive
research on African elephants in
the past, said this new method has
the potential to ease the poaching
problem by providing precise data.
He said one of the main questions
that this research could answer is
exactly how illegal ivory is being
obtained. If the tests indicate that
the seized ivory is from elephants
who have died in the last few years,
they will have evidence of current
and active poaching. Likewise,
if the ivory appears to be taken
from animals killed within the last
20 years, the researchers will be
able to infer that it is coming from
storehouses.
"We're very interested in how
this ivory being is procured,"
Wittemyer said. "This is an
important technique to help us
identify the mechanisms of the
trade."

FACULTY

against the state of Michigan
defending the right of higher
education institutions to use
affirmative action policies in
their admissions procedures. The
case, Cantrell v. Granholm was
later combined with Coalition
to Defend Affirmative Action v.
Granholm by the U.S. District
Court of Eastern Michigan. The
District Court ruled summarily
in both cases in favor of the state.
The CDAA successfully appealed
to the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court,
which reversed the District
Court's ruling. In November
2012, a 15-judge panel ruled
S to 7 to uphold the reversal
of the District Court's ruling.
However, it stayed its own ruling
from taking effect pending the
Supreme Court's review, which
it granted on March 25.
The nation's highest court
will hear the case in its autumn
session of this year.
The coalition argued that
MCRI is a violation of the
14th Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution since it allegedly
prevents minority students
from fully exploring and using
their experiences with race
in the college admissions
process. Their argument also
relies on precedent set in
Grutter v. Bollinger and Gratz
v. Bollinger, historic cases in
which the University was the
party - and bearing the name
of former University President
Lee Bollinger - which defined
the legality and parameters of
affirmative action programs
across the nation.
In their initial filing with
the Supreme Court, Michigan
Attorney General Bill Schuette
and the associated petitioners
rebuffed both the reasoning
of the coalition and the Sixth
Circuit Court, writing, "It is
exceedingly odd to say that a
statute which bars a state from
"discriminat(ing) ... on the
basis of race" violates the Equal
Protection Clause because it
discriminates on the basis of
race and sex. Yet that is precisely
what the en bane majority held
here."
While the future of
affirmative action hinges on the
outcome of the case, the court is
expected to be equally interested
in determining what power
courts can have in overturning
popular referendum. While the

Sixth Circuit Court, sitting en
bane, upheld overturning the
MCRI, the Ninth Circuit Court
did not support a challenge
to California's Proposition
209 in 1997 - another ban on
affirmative action.
Reconciling these two
conflicting circuit court
precedents will be one of the
chief tasks of the Supreme Court
as the eight justices consider the
case. Justice Elena Kagan, an
appointee of President Barack
Obama, recused herself from the
case due to perceived conflicts
of interest from her time as
Solicitor General.
As the case's hearing draws
closer, both the University and
other parties are considering
preparing briefs for submission
to the court. After the passage
of the MCRI, University
President Mary Sue Coleman
publicly promised to challenge
the initiative in court in a
dramatic speech on the Diag.
In a December interview with
The Michigan Daily, when
asked whether she would have
any concerns about reinstating
a policy the majority of voters
opposed, Coleman said she
would not commit herself to any
course of action before the court
ruled.
"There's a pretty robust
argument going on in the legal
community about constitutional
amendments and what this
means," Coleman said. "I
wouldn't want to opine on that
yet until we're faced with it."
As Coleman is stepping down
from her role as president next
year, the decision of whether
or not to reinstate affirmative
action programs will likely fall
to her successor, pending the
court's ruling.
Because the University is
listed as a respondent in the
case, University spokesman
Rick Fitzgerald could only
offer limited comment on the
administration's legal strategy
in approaching the case. He
emphasized that though the
University continues to support
affirmative action, it cannot take
any action as long as the MCRI
remains in effect.
Michigan State University,
also a party in the case, is
currently preparing its brief
for submission to the Supreme
Court. MSU spokesman Jason
Cody said the school would
likely be filing its brief some
time in August but was unable to
comment further since it is still

being written.
Though the University has
not made a move to file a brief,
Philosophy Prof. Carl Cohen,
one of the University's most
senior tenured faculty and an
outspoken critic of affirmative
action policies, has filed a joint
amicus curiae brief with other
opponents from across the
country.
While the brief draws heavily
on reasoning from the Texas
Association of Scholars in its
opposition to affirmative action
policies, Cohen said he focused
his portion of the brief more on
the constitutionality of popular
referendum - which he sees as the
most important issue of the case.
"I was amazed at the decision
of the Circuit Court," he said.
"The people of the state of
Michigan have the right to
determine policy of the state of
Michigan within the frame of
the United States Constitution.
The Sixth Circuit Court of
Appeals denied them that right
and decided on their own view
of the matter that this was not
appropriate decision making for
the people of the state."
Citing James Madison's
Federalist Papers, Cohen also
said the Sixth Circuit Court had
exercised its "will" rather than
its "judgment," and that popular
referendum must be answerable
only to the strictures of the
Constitution itself in judicial
review.
Since the central question is
the power and legal standing of
a popularly adopted referendum,
Cohen said he could see some
of the court's liberal justices
supporting overturning the
Sixth Circuit Court's decision
in the interests of popular
sovereignty.
"I don't think people fully
understand what's at issue here,"
Cohen said. "People think 'are
they for affirmative action or
are they against it?' But that's
not the issue here - the issue is
the right of the people to make a
decision against certain policies
whether you like that policy or
don't like that policy."
He added that he saw it as
likely that the court will, in the
end, reverse the Sixth Circuit
Court's ruling.
"An honest of the intellectual
or civil community will say,
'Look, whatever I may think
about affirmative action, I think
it's reasonable for the people to
decide whether they want it or
don't want it.'"

A remedy abroad

n the plane to Buenos Aires
I had no idea what was
in store for me. A million
emotions darted
through me
while I nervously
sat on my 11-hour,
flight. I had
never been south
of Mexico ever in
my life, let alone
without my par- SARA
ents. Was I crazy SHOUHAYIB
for going to a
country where I
didn't know a single soul? It was too
late to turn back. I reclined my seat
and closed my eyes. I woke up to a
flight attendant telling me we were
preparing for landing. I looked out
the window and saw greenery, and
thought to myself, "Hey, this really
doesn't look any different from
home." Man, was I wrong.
I instantly felt like an alien when
I tried to catch a cab at the airport.
My Spanish definitely was not as
good as I thought. Argentinians
have a distinct accent where they
pronounce all words with a "Y" or
a double "L" as a "J". So words like
"ella," meaning "her," would sound
like "eja". It tripped me up a lot.
Eight years of Spanish only got me
here? Sheesh.
I was scared and I was worried.
I didn't know if I could muster the
courage to make mistakes and risk
looking like an idiot while trying to
speak a foreign language. I remem-
bered a quote by Eleanor Roosevelt
that I had framed on my night-
stand back home in Michigan. It
said, "Believe in yourself. You gain
strength, courage and confidence by
every experience in which you stop
to look fear in the face ... you must do
that which you think you cannot do."
I carried this quote in mind for
the first few weeks of my five-month
journey. It slowly became a part of
my everyday actions and me. I tried
things I normally wouldn't try and
I experimented with my limits. I
was able to travel to Chile, Uruguay,
Colombia, Bolivia and Peru during
my stay. I never imagined I would
be that fortunate to backpack with
my friends like that. It changed my
life and how I viewed the world
around me. It made me feel free and
powerful, like I had the world at my
fingertips.
For my fellow Wolverines - or
any college students for that matter
- who are interested in studying
abroad, I have a few words for you:
Take the path less traveled.
Most people choose to go to Spain

or Europe to study abroad. Try
something different.
Studying abroad opens your
eyes, and as cliche as it sounds, it
truly does broaden your horizons.
If you didn't have the opportunity
to grow up in an ethnic home it's
your chance to adopt a new culture.
Live at a home-stay if you have the
opportunity - you won't regret it. I
lived with a 70-year-old seamstress
whom I grew to love like my own
grandmother. I owe my Spanish
proficiency to her - she didn't
know a lick of English. By studying
abroad you can connect to the
native people of the country you're
in and most importantly it helps
teach you about yourself. It teaches
you about your fears and how much
you're willing to push the limits of
your life.
It's a big world
out there. Go
explore it.
I was afraid I wouldn't make
friends. In retrospect, I was silly
for thinking that. I made three
extraordinary friends from all over
the U.S. during my program, from
Washington D.C., Texas and North
Carolina - all of whom I have visited
after my abroad experience. They
became my family away from home.
I will love and cherish them for the
rest of my life. They're the kind of
friends I want at my wedding.
Truthfully, before Argentina, I
felt lost. I had gone through some
things leading up to my departure
and I wasn't the happiest meI could
be. The beautiful city of Buenos
Aires was the remedy I needed. I
finally felt like me again. I fell in
love with South America and it will
alwaysbe aregionoftheworldthat I
hold close to my heart. It helped me
discover who I was and what I was
capable of. My college experience
never would have been the same if
it weren't for study abroad. It was
the time of my life still to this day. I
wish there was a way I could pay it
back, because Iam forever indebted
to the happiness and fulfillment it
gave me.
Regardless of where you choose
to go, it's a big world out there. Go
explore it.

"That approach fits right in with
the values that are important to our
community: sustainable practices, a
large, varied menu and easy-to-find
nutritional information," Pile said.
Unlike other eateries operating
out of the Union, Au Bon Pain will
be open throughthe Union'shours of

operation - till 2 a.m. during the fall
and winter semesters. Pile said, based
on recent memory, she could not
recall another eatery that remained
open through the Union's hours.
LSA senior Adam Kleven, chair
of the Michigan Union Board of
Representatives, noted that the new
cafes were "a positive change" from
the student perspective. Despite an
anonymous Facebook campaign and
efforts to discuss lease extensions,

University Unions requested that
Amer's vacate their Union location at
the expiration of their lease - after
19 years of service.
"Au Bon Pain wants to ensure
student needs are met in terms
of food selection and social
space," Kleven said. "Starbucks
is undeniably popular and will
increase the number of students who
come into the Union."
Architectural renovations will

accompany the incoming tenants as
they move into the spaces. Though
specific details regarding interior
changes are unavailable, Pain
said the Union would maintain
its historic elements - such as its
brick walls, arches and windows.
Renovations will commence at the
end of August.
Starbucks and Au Bon Pain have
both signed binding 10-year leases
with the University.

"In a sense, (private
universities) got the early
visibility but I think it will be
the large public universities
that, if this outreach really is
as successful as many people
hope it will be, I think the
lead will rapidly shift to public
universities like Michigan
and University of California,"
Duderstadt said.
However, he added that the
online classes are only courses,
not a "college education".
Duderstadt said there was
an "enormous" difference
between online and traditional
classes, noting factors like the
high level of self-motivation
needed to complete online
"Most of the learning in true
universities, like Michigan, is
an endeavor that depends very
heavily on people-to-people
and human interaction,"
Duderstadt said. "That's not
something you can replicate at
a distance."
Business Prof. Gautam Kaul,
who recently added a finance
class to Coursera, said the goal
of MOOCs is not to replace the
classroom. The three goals
are to provide public access,
experiment with the current
technology and to advertise the
University.
"We don't want to be in the
game of making education a
commodity," Kaul said. "We
want to be in the game of
being known to experiment
with technology to enhance
learning."
He said as a professor,
creating a curriculum for an
online class has helped him
become a better instructor,
since he had to reconsider the
different ways students learn.
Duderstadt said as the
University continues to learn
from experimenting with
MOOCs, it is difficult to
determine the future of online
material due to the rapidly
changing technology they are
faced with.
"What we don't want to do
is say, 'Five years from now
every classroom on the campus
will have taped all the video
lectures that our faculty gives
and that's how you go to class,'
because we would be terribly
wrong." Duderstadt said.

MWireless will
replace UM Wireless
in August
By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
DailyNewsEditor
Starting in the fall, choosing
which wireless networkto connect
to will be simpler. Information
and Technology Services has
announced that they will be
disbanding the UM Wireless
Network - curbing the options
for networks to MWireless and
MGuest.
According to the ITS website,
MWireless provides University
affiliates with greater security
when connecting to the wireless
network, as compared to other
networks. MWireless encrypts
all data transmitted between the
wireless device and the Access
Point, whereas UM Wireless
encrypts only the uniqname and
password entered during login.
Andy Palms, ITS executive
director of communication systems
and data centers, said the high
encryption standards of MWireless
are important to students, as the
old network allowed hackers to
access all information transmitted
wirelesslyapartfromthepassword.
Although MWireless was
implemented in 2008 in
accordance with the latestsecurity
standards atthat time, ITS decided
to retain the dated UM Wireless
Network for nearly five years.
Palms said he understands
that University affiliates were
accustomed to authenticating to
the network via the UM Wireless
network splash page and that the
additionaltimerequiredto initially
set up MWireless discouraged
users from transitioning to the
new technology.
"The downside of MWireless is
that it is just not what people are
used to," he said.
However, after initial
authentication, MWireless

automatically connects wireless
devices to the network when
in a University Wi-Fi hotspot
- eliminating the need to
periodically input uniqname and
password.
To promote MWireless,
ITS began an advertisement
campaign that included displaying
informative posters throughout
campus. Furthermore, the UM
Wireless Network splash page and
the ITS webpage encouraged users
to switch over to the new network
as their default choice.
"I think it's been up in front
of people for quite a while,"
Palms said. "We're really trying
to encourage people to (use)
MWireless."
The reason for choosing to
disband the dated network now
was twofold, Palms said. Firstly,
he said ITS wanted to provide
users to with a "transition period"
to adjust to new technologies.
Although the exact number of
users remains unclear, Palms said
he believed that roughly 60 to 70
percent of University affiliates
used MWireless as their primary
network.
Additionally, the transition
allowed ITS to prepare its
systems for the introduction of
Eduroam - a worldwide network
access implemented to facilitate
educational interaction among
institutions. By choosing to
retire the UM Wireless Network,
additional network capacity could
be allocated to Eduroam.
Eduroam will likely be
introduced by October2013, Palms
said.
Currently, the MGuest network
serves asanalternative for wireless
users without a unigname and
Kerberos password. Palms said
the purpose of each authentication
method became more confusing
with the number of networks that
remained available.
"There's no particular need that
the UM Wireless meets for people
anymore that can't be met by
(MWireless and MGuest)," he said.
