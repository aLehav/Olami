UNIVERSITY RESEARCH
New drug could reduce death
rates of bone marrow disease

Amid scandal,
Yaron Eliav forced
to step down from
committee posts
By CAITLIN HUSTON
Daily News Editor
Yaron Eliav, an associate pro-
fessor of rabbinic literature at the
University, has finished his court-
ordered probation after pleading
no contest to the charge of using
a computer to commit a crime
in 2008. However, e-mail con-
versations and court documents
obtained by The Michigan Daily
show the University initially
imposed restrictions on his pro-
fessorship after the incident.
Eliav was involved in an inci-
dent in April 2008 when he
responded to advertised sexual
acts on Craigslist that were post-
ed by a 22-year-old University
Law school student. Eliav paid
the student $300 for sexual acts.
During the incident, the student
allowed him to slap her buttocks
but became concerned when he
slapped her twice on the face. The
student pursued Eliav in court
after their encounter.
Eliav received a deferred sen-

tence on Dec. 30, 2008 after
pleading no contest to the charge
of using a computer to commit a
crime.
The student involved also
received a deferred sentence after
pleading no contest to the charge
of using a computer to commit a
crime.
Steve Hiller, deputy chief pros-
ecuting attorney for Washtenaw
County who was not involved
in the lawsuit, said the case was
dismissed in November 2009.
He added that Eliav and the Law
student successfully completed
their probationary periods and
"no longer have a public record of
conviction."
Eliav wrote in an e-mail inter-
view this week that he and the
Law student currently have no
legal repercussions as a result of
the situation.
"I wish to emphasize that the
incident concluded without any
legal consequences, for me or the
woman involved; the only charge
that was eventually brought to
court against us - illegal use of a
computer - was dismissed with-
out conviction and without any
criminal record," Eliav wrote.
"In other words, I was not found
guilty of any wrongdoing."

In mice, drug
prototype prevents
graft-versus-host
disease
By RACHEL BRUSSTAR
Daily StaffReporter
University researchers have
developed a prototype drug that
may positively impact the future
of bone marrow transplants and

the treatment of autoimmune
diseases.
The collaborative research of
Gary Glick, the Werner E. Bach-
mann Collegiate Professor of
Chemistry at the University, and
James Ferrara, director of the
Blood and Marrow Transplant
Program at the University's
Comprehensive Cancer Center,
focuses on the metabolism of
cells and aims to stop the devel-
opment of graft-versus-host dis-
ease known as GVHD.
GVHD can be a major com-

plication during bone marrow
transplant procedures, Ferrara
said. According to a Jan. 26 Uni-
versity press release, the new
findings could potentially create
new ways to fight immune dis-
eases.
Glick and Ferrara, among oth-
ers, recently co-wrote a study on
the effectiveness of the proto-
type drug Bz-423 in stoppingthe
onset of GVHD, accordingto the
press release. The findings of the
study, which was performed on
mice, was published in Science

Translational Medicine maga-
zine on Jan.26.
Ferrara explained that the
research on Bz-423 initially
began with Glick's "long-stand-
ing interest in the bioenergetics
or the metabolism of cells."
According to Ferrara, Glick
first discovered Bz-423 through
the screening process of com-
pounds and also found it could
"get activated cells to die in a test
tube," preventing the contrac-
tion of GVHD in the test animals.

Monkeying around in the classroom

Q:Where did you go to school?
Sm a Californian. I grew up in
California, and I was an undergrad-
uate at University of California,
Berkley. I did my graduate work at
the University of California, Davis.
Also, I did postdoctoral research at
Rockefeller University in New York.
Q: When did you come to the
University?
I came to the University in 1990.
Q: What courses are you cur-
rently teaching?
Currently, I am on sabbatical
leave. However, I usually teach a
cross-disciplinary course between
the anthropology and psychology
departments. I personally call it
"Monkey for the Masses," but the
name of the actual course is Pri-
mate Social Behavior.

Q: Do you like it here at the
University?
When I look out my window and
Isee the snow, Isometimes ask why
I'm here. But the college and the
people ... are supportive. It's been
good. I'm a Michigan Man, despite
my roots.
Q:What is your researchabout
and where has it taken you?
I have studied the behavior of all
five species of apes: gibbons, orang-
utans, gorillas, bonobos and chim-
panzees. I've studied in Indonesia,
Rwanda, the Democratic Republic
of Congo and Uganda. I started off
doing field research on AIDS in
Asia. Currently, I study a communi-
ty of wild chimpanzees in Uganda.
Q:What is your teaching style?
I teach in a big lecture setting

with over 200 students. When I
first started teaching, it was like I
was looking at a sea of anonymous.
faces. I wanted to get to know as
many students as possible. So at
the top of the hour of each class, I
would work the room. I would just
walk around and talk to the stu-
dents. I try to start dialogue with
the students also. I try to get them4
to ask questions.
When I think students seem
interested in the subject, I like to
play "Stump the Chump." This is a
game where students are ableto ask
me questions, and if I get the wrong
answer, the students get a prize. I
really like to engage the students.
I want to make it a little more per-
sonal for me and the students. Anthropology Prof. John

In stability effort, U.S. funds
electricity project in Sudan

Civil war left most
of Southern Sudan
in the dark
KAPOETA, Sudan (AP) - The
power lines, electricity poles and
street lamps that now dot the red
dirt roads of the Southern Suda-
nese town of Kapoeta seem out
of place next to the rusting tanks
and shot-up buildings.
The electrification project,
which was funded by U.S. gov-
ernment aid, is one sign that the
U.S. is intent on helping bring
development and stability to
what will soon be Africa's new-
est country.
The final results from South-
ern Sudan's January inde-
pendence referendum were
announced Monday, with nearly

99 percent of ballots cast for
independence. Southern Sudan
is slated to become a new coun-
try in July, and it will need all the
help it can get.
Southern Sudan President
Salva Kiir, in his first com-
ments since the results were
announced, said Tuesday that
the vote was the "crowning
moment of all the sacrifices made
during our long struggle."
More than 2 million people
died during the nearly two-
decade war that ended in 2005.
"It is a glorious day for Africa
and the world," Kiir said. "You
exercised your inalienable right
to self-determination freely, fair-
ly and peacefully."
Decades of civil war between
the mainly Christian-animist
south and the mainly Muslim
north mean most of Southern

Sudan has no electricity, roads or
other infrastructure, despite the
south's oil riches. .
In the barren scrubland of
Eastern Equatoria state, where
the U.S. has just funded the elec-
trification project in Kapoeta,
semi-nomadic herders from
the Toposa tribe carry spears

tion and wear leopard skins and
feather headdresses for celebra-
tions.

Polish publishing house defends
controversial Holocaust book

Authors claims
Poles dug up Jewish
graves in search for
valuables
WARSAW, Poland (AP) - A
Polish publishing house defended
its decision yesterday to publish
a book that has sparked contro-
versy with its argument that Poles
actively profited from Jewish suf-
fering duringthe Holocaust.
"Golden Harvest," by Jan Gross
and Irena Grudzinska Gross,
argues that rural Poles sometimes
sought financial gain from Jewish
misfortune in a variety of ways,
from plundering Jewish mass
graves to ferreting out Jews in
hiding for reward.
Gross said the starting point of
the book is a photograph show-
ing Polish peasants digging up
A

human remains at the Treblinka
death camp just after the war in a
search for gold or other treasures
that Nazi executioners might have
overlooked. Scattered in front of
the group are skulls and bones.
The thesis challenges a wide-
spread view among Poles that
their nation, which was occupied
by Germany throughout World
War II, by and large behaved hon-
orably during that time. Six mil-
lion Polish citizens - half of them
Jews - were killed during the
war and memories remain strong
of Polish suffering and sacrifice.
Heroic Polish deeds - like the
Warsaw Uprising of 1944 against
Nazi rule - are a foundation of
the national identity, while the
state in recent years has regularly
bestowed honors on Christian
Poles who risked their lives to
hide Jews from the Nazis.
Henryk Wozniakowski, the
head of publishing house Znak,

said the book aims to make the
public aware of "cruel and often
difficult facts."
The book "challenges our col-
lective memory" and is an attempt
to seek some justice for Holocaust
victims, he said.
Speaking by phone from the
United States, Gross told The
Associated Press that he seeks to
"tell the story of the war as it hap-
pened" and show that the Holo-
caust is an integral part of Polish
history.
"Non-Jews were subjected to
a horrible degree of violence by
the Nazi occupiers and there is a
very prominent phenomenon of
resistance on a unique scale," he
said. But "alongside the heroism
there was also malfeasance, and
one finds that these stories run
in parallel. There was a signifi-
cant degree of collusion and per-
secution of Jews when it proves a
material advantage."

Activist released
after 12 days of
secret detention
CAIRO (AP) - A young
Google executive who helped
ignite Egypt's uprising ener-
gized a cheering crowd of hun-
dreds of thousands yesterday
with his first appearance in
their midst after being released
from 12 days in secret detention.
"We won't give up," he promised
at one of the biggest protests yet
in Cairo's Tahrir Square.
Once a behind-the-scenes
Internet activist, 30-year-old
Wael Ghonim has emerged as an
inspiring voice for a movement
that has taken pride in being
a leaderless "people's revolu-
tion." Now, the various activists
behind it - including Ghonim
- are working to coalesce into
representatives to push their
demands for President Hosni
Mubarak's ouster.
With protests invigorated,
Vice President Omar Suleiman
issued a sharply worded warn-
ing, saying of the protests in
Tahrir, "We can't bear this for
a long time, and there must be
an end to this crisis as soon as
possible," in a sign of growing

impatience with 16 days of mass
demonstrations.
For the first time, protest-
ers made a foray to Parliament,
several blocks away from their
camp in the square. Several
hundred marched to the legis-
lature and chanted for it to be
dissolved.
In Tahrir, the massive,
shoulder-to-shoulder crowd's
ranks swelled with new blood,
including thousands of uni-
versity professors and lawyers
who marched in together as
organizers worked to draw in
professional unions. The crowd
rivaled the biggest demonstra-
tion so far, a week ago, that drew
a quarter-million people.
Some said they were inspired
to turn out by an emotional
television interview Ghonim
gave Monday night just after
his release from detention. He
sobbed over those who have
been killed in two weeks of
clashes and insisted, "We love
Egypt ... and we have rights."
"I cried," a 33-year-old
upper-class housewife, Fifi
Shawqi, said of the interview
with Ghonim, who she'd never
heard of before the TV appear-
ance. She came to the Tahrir
protest for the first time, bring-
ing her three daughters and her

sister. "I felt like he is my son
and all the youth here are my
sons."
Yesterday's huge turnout
gave a resounding answer to the
question of whether the protest-
ers still have momentum even
though two weeks of steadfast
pressure have not achieved
their goal of ousting 82-year-old
Mubarak, Egypt's authoritarian
leader for nearly three decades.
Suleiman rejected any depar-
ture for Mubarak or "end to
the regime. He told a gather-
ing of newspaper editors that
the regime prefers to deal with
the crisis using dialogue, add-
ing, "We don't want to deal with
Egyptian society with police
tools." He warned that the alter-
native to dialogue was "a coup"
- a possible hint of an imposi-
tion of military rule. However,
editors present at the meeting
said he then explained he didn't
mean a military coup but that
"a force that is unprepared for
rule" could overturn state insti-
tutions.
U.S. Vice President Joe Biden
spoke by phone with Suleiman,
saying Washington wants Egypt
to immediately rescind emer-
gency laws that give broad pow-
ers to security forces - a key
demand of the protesters.

research tool innovations like
the electron microscope and

in manufactured products like

"Nanotechnology just isn't
about measuring and seeing,"
Banaszak-Holl said. "Nano-

In response to Maynard's
question about whether nan-

Nanotechnology has faced
criticism from a number of

have raised questions about
the health risks incurred from
using nanotechnologies. Phil-

other similar materials, has
positive and negative effects,
depending on the amount
used.
"Everything is both, in and

Nanotechnology is simi-

ogy use is only one of many
issues addressed in scientific
public policy, Parthasarathy
said.
"The challenge of gover-
nance here is not restricted
to the challenge of nanotech-
nology," she said. "We have a
challenge with dealing with
emerging technologies and
how do we go about regulating
them."
The debate on nanotechnol-
ogy often centers on the differ-
ences between science-based
problems and value-based

ing Rep. Kyle Summers, chair
of the Rules Committee, and
Interim Vice Speaker Sean
Walser. The amendment calls
for a process of directing com-
plaints about student organi-
zations through the Student
General Counsel and MSA's
Central Student Judiciary, the
judicial branch of the MSA.
"I doubt it will be much of an
issue, but it'sjust a wayto make
sure we stay socially just and
true to our constitution," Bek-
kers said in an interview after
the meeting. "It's an obligation
anyway, but this sets up a pro-
cess to work through the SGC
and CSJ."
LSA Rep. Brendan Fried-
man, chair of MSA's Resolu-
tions Committee, voted against
the resolution and said he was
concerned the amendment to
MSA's Compiled Code gave too
much power to the SGC, who
is appointed by the MSA presi-
dent.
Under the new Compiled
Code, the SGC can suspend

student organizations pending
a judgment from CSJ.
"I see no reason to give
such a vast power to the SGC,"
Friedman said at the meeting.
Another resolution amend-
ed MSA's Compiled Code to
require the MSA treasurer
to present a report on MSA's
financial budget status at the
beginning of each semester
before the new semester's bud-
get is compiled.
The resolution - written
by Finance Committee Chair
Matthew Eral and Finance
Committee Vice Chair Anne
Murkowski - states that the
status report must include the
amounts delegated for and
spent by each committee and
the balance that will roll over
to the next semester's budget.
A second resolution, related
to finance oversight, passed
by the assembly amends the
standing rules to codify the
guidelines that MSA's trea-
surer must follow when pre-
senting a new budget to the
assembly.
The resolution, also drafted
by Eral and Murkowski, will
require MSA budget resolu-
tions to note the total amount
of funds available, include a
summary of where funds are

problems, Parthasarathy said.
Nanotechnology poses a val-
ue-based problem in the public
policy arena, she said.
In response to Parthasara-
thy's remarks, Banaszak-Holl
said only a few members of
Congress hold degrees in the
sciences. Therefore, scientists
themselves aren't able to dic-
tate policy on a national level.
Though legislators may
not be scientific experts, Par-
thasarathy said they do look
to scientists for guidance on
issues like the safety of nano-
technology.
"The infrastructure of how
we make regulatory decisions
is one that is based heavily on
what we call scientific adviso-
ry committees," she said.
Philbert disagreed with
Parthasarathy, saying politi-
cians are often influenced by
public perception rather than
science.
"There is almost no connec-
tion, frequently, between the
science and the ultimate deci-
sion-making because the deci-
sion makers have the direct
imperative to get re-elected,"
Philbert said.
Paula Lantz, chair of the
Department of Health Man-
agement and Policy in the
School of Public Health,
asked the panelists later in
the discussion what they
thought about the capabilities
of agencies like the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration or
Environmental Protection
Agency to regulate nanotech-
nologies.
Philbert responded by say-
ing though regulatory agen-
cies have lost funding, new
technologies have allowed
them to make better deci-
sions. The enforcement of
nanotechnology is difficult
considering the risks and ben-
efits associated with its use,
he added.
"We're always engineering
toward the perfect, and there
is no perfect environment,"
Philbert said.
currently allocated and refer-
ence the financial status report.
Additionally, the treasurer
must have a detailed break-
down of the budget available
for MSA members with ques-
tions about funding allotments.
MSA Treasurer Ambreen
Sayed wasn't in attendance at
last night's meeting and didn't
return several inquiries from
The Michigan Daily as of last
night.
MSA also passed a resolu-
tion supporting the creation of
a student organization panel
during the University's new
student orientation to help
students learn about opportu-
nities available to them before
they arrive in Ann Arbor in the
fall.
"Many students adjusting to
campus life either fail to gain
awareness of student organiza-
tions or become overwhelmed
by the number of student orga-
nizations on campus," the reso-
lution states.
The resolution, written by
Friedman and LSA Rep. Peri
Silverman, will be sent to Ann
Hower, director of the Univer-

sity's Office of New Student
Programs, and James Brown,
assistant director of the Uni-
versity's Office for Student
Activities and Leadership.
Another resolution passed
last night will create a task
force to "investigate the feasi-
bility of getting North Campus
resources on Central Campus."
Written by Engineering Rep.
Crissie Zuchora and Kunal
Mehta, president of the Univer-
sity of Michigan Engineering
Council, the resolution calls
for the creation of a task force
chaired by Zuchora. The group
will look into the possibility of
improving Central Campus's
access to resources used by
College of Engineering, School
of Music, Theater & Dance,
College of Architecture and
Urban Planning and School of
Art & Design students.
The resolution cites inad-
equate Computer Aided Engi-
neering Network computers,
printing, practice rooms and
studio space on Central Cam-
pus as examples of things to
be improved. The task force
will present its analysis of the
cost and potential effects of
providing these resources and
an implementation plan on or
before MSA's March 8 meet-
ing.

SANCTIONS
From Page 1A
campus in fall 2009. As an asso-
ciate professor in the Depart-
ment of Near Eastern Studies,
Eliav is teaching two courses this
semester - "The Land of Israel/
Palestine through the Ages" and
"Introduction to Rabbinic Litera-
ture."
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said Eliav currently
holds a tenured position and is
under no additional restrictions
from the University other than
what was originally enforced.
Eliav said he "deeply regrets"
that the incident happened and
hopes to continue to serve his stu-
dents and the University to the
best of his abilities.
"People make mistakes," Eliav
wrote. "Thankfully, as humans,
we can take responsibility for our
mistakes, learn from them, take
the necessary steps to correct
them and hopefully be allowed to
move on."
Around the time of the trial, the
University conducted an inves-
tigation to see if Eliav utilized
University resources while using
a computer to commit a crime.
A Dec. 28, 2008 letter from LSA
Dean Terrence McDonald to Eliav,
which was obtained by the Daily,
outlined the findings of the inves-
tigation.
The letter cites police records
in which Eliav confessed to using
the alias Mark Tegels inhis online
exchanges with the Law student.
The University's investiga-
tion found that Eliav also used
University computers to view a
Craigslist posting and to com-
municate with other Craigslist
members about their personal
advertisements.
The letter states that these
actions were inviolationof several
University policies, including that
faculty members should view their
access to resources as a "privilege"
and must use the resources "with
respect for the public trust." The
policies also state that a member
of the University cannot "assume
another person's identity or role
through deception without proper

authorization."
According to the letter, Eliav
violated these policies and vio-
lated conduct required by faculty
under University policies, state
and federal laws. Along with
bringing negative media atten-
tion to himself, the letter states
that Eliav's conduct "damaged the
reputation of the University and
College."
Eliav agreed to the University
sanctions, according to the letter.
He was required to resign from
the Jean and Samuel Frankel Pro-
fessorship in Rabbinic Literature
and give up all salary and research
funds gained from that position.
Eliav also gave up his leadership
position with search committees
for new faculty in the Department
of Near Eastern Studies and the
Frankel Center for Judaic Studies
at the University.
According to a Dec. 9, 2008
e-mail sent by Gary Beckman,
chair of the Department of Near
Eastern Studies, to LSA Associate
Dean Derek Collins, the Depart-
ment of Near Eastern Studies
received signed letters and peti-
tions from faculty members of
Judaic Studies and Near East-
ern Studies demanding Eliav's
removal from the search commit-
tees.
Eliav added that he thought the
conduct of the University and the
Department of Near Eastern Stud-
ies regarding the incident was
"fair and measured."
Fitzgerald said if an incident
like this happened with another
professor in the future, the Uni-
versity would respond to the situ-
ation depending on individual
circumstances.
"Ithinkin anysituationlikethis
the University would approach
those unique set of circumstances
and try to do what is best in those
unique set of circumstances," he
said.
Other University sanctions
included ineligibility for any
chairmanship at the University
for five years and Eliav's resigna-
tion fromtheexecutive committee
of the Frankel Center for Judaic
Studies and his head fellow posi-
tion in the Frankel Institute for
Advanced Judaic Studies. His

resignation from the institute also
meant he had to teach full time
during the 2009-2010 school year
in order tofulfill his professorship.
Eliav was officially removed
from the Frankel Endowed Chair
position on Jan. 26, 2009, and his
appointment was relocated to
Near Eastern Studies, where his
salary was supported through the
University's general fund.
In a Jan. 30, 2009 e-mail, Col-
lins wrote to Eliav that due to his
resignation, Eliav would no lon-
ger be identified as "head fellow"
of the research group on Jewish
Material Culture nor as Jean and
Samuel Frankel Associate Profes-
sor for Rabbinic Literature. Alater
e-mail clarified that Eliav would
still be able to identify his sub-field
areas of expertise.
Eliav requested a leave of
absence unrelated to the sanctions
for medical reasons, he wrote in
the e-mail interview. He returned
to teach at the University in fall
2009 after his leave of absence
during the previouswinter semes-
ter.
Collins's letter also noted that
this was the second time Eliav was
brought before the University due
to an incident of sexual miscon-
duct. In 2006, an undergraduate
employee of Near Eastern Studies
filed a complaint against Eliav for
inappropriate speech and physical
contact, which was later decided
to be unfounded.
While Eliav was on leave, the
Program on Judaism and Chris-
tianity in Antiquity replaced the
Program in Judaism and Christi-
anity in the Greco-Roman, until
both were eliminated in March
2009. Both department programs
were replaced by individual pro-
grams in the Department of Near
Eastern Studies and advised by
faculty members, including Eliav.
Eliav wrote that the set up of
the programs was always infor-
mal and their dissolution was due
to uncertainty in the department
as well as his courtcase.
"At the time, with all the uncer-
tainty involved, we felt it would
be better to let it go and allow
students to pursue their stud-
ies according to their individual
interests," Eliav wrote.


FLU
From Page1A
virus last year resulted in the flu
season beginning in September
and peaking in November, Ernst
said. This meant that UHS had to
adapt its procedure to cope with
the increase in students visiting
the clinic. This flu season, how-
ever, is more similar to previous
years, he said.
"Normally, we expect to see
an increase in activity between
NovemberthroughMarch ... If you
look at what's happening over the
last few weeks, we've been seeing
a steady increase in cases of both
confirmed and suspicious activity
attributable to influenza," Ernst
said.
Carol Chenoweth, clinical pro-
fessor of epidemiology and a Uni-
versity Hospital epidemiologist,
said the number of influenza cases
at the hospital has been increasing
since January and that there have
been 37 confirmed cases at the
hospital in the past week.
UHS has continued to adopt
some of the strategies for handling
fluvaccines this year asit didwhen
dealing with the HIN1 virus like
encouraging people to wash their
hands and insisting that infected
students remain isolated.
When individuals are experi-
encing symptoms like fever, aches
and coughing, they shouldn't be in
public places, Ernst said.
"If people are sick with the flu,
they should not be in their class-
room until their fever breaks,"
Ernst said. "We do not want sick
kids in the classroom ... That's

what's going to cause the spread of
the virus."
Ernst also said requiring stu-
dents to get a doctor's note from
UHS to miss class without penalty
is problematic, as it could increase
the risk of the virus spreading.
"If it's required for a student to
have a note, then that creates a bit
of a problem in that the students
are coming here just for getting a
note," Ernst said. "Students should
not be out and about if they are
sick. They should not be conva-
lescing in public."
Brian Porter-Szucs, an asso-
ciate professor of history at the
University, said he has a strict
attendance policy for his classes
and doesn't accept notes from
UHS. However, he does allow stu-
dents one absence.
"One thing you learn very
quickly in this job - that when
finals come around, a lot of people
get sick," Porter-Szucs said. "So I
don't know whether it's legit or
not, and I don't want to be in the
position of being the jerk who
says to somebody who was really
sick, 'I don't believe you' or be the
sucker who says to somebody who
really wasn't sick that they could
get free credit."
However, other instructors like
Rostom Mesh, a graduate student
instructor in the Department of
Comparative Literature, have a
different approach as Mesli said
he accepts doctors' notes from stu-
dents who were sick.
Chenoweth said though stu-
dents aren't as likely to contract
the flu as the elderly, they are more
at risk than the of contracting the
HNIvirus.

"Older people seem to have
irmmiunity to the HINT virus..."
Chenoweth said. "That is the
primary virus that is circulating
this year. Unless people start get-
ting vaccinated, I would expect
that it's probably going to be
affecting the younger people and
children."
Engineering sophomore Ben
Brelje said he decided not to get
the flu vaccine this year.
"Last year I got vaccinated
because I was in the dorm and it
was convenient," he said. "This
year I haven't gotten an e-mail
or anything about it, so it's not
immediately apparent, and I've
never gotten the flu - even when
I (don't) get vaccinated - so it's
never really been a problem for
me."
Rackham student Andres
Pletch said he decided to get the
flu shot since he couldn't afford
the time wasted if he were to
become ill.
"It would be awful if I got sick,
considering how much work I
have to do," Pletch said.
LSA freshman Sophia Park said
she was sick last semester and was
required to get a note from UHS
for one of her classes. She said she
was frustrated that she had to get
a new note for every day she was
sick.
"The only problem with UHS
is that if you're sick one day, then
you have to go the next day and get
another note and it would just be
the same diagnoses over and over
again," Park said.

DISEASE
From Page 1A
"The drug affects activated
lymphocytes, and it drove them
to suicide," Ferrara said. "These
are the cells that are continuously
activated and attacking the tis-
sues of the animal or the patient,
and so this is able to arrest this
disease ... called graft-versus-host
disease."
Bone marrow transplantations
are currently reserved for the
most life-threatening hematolog-
ic malignancies, or cancers that
affect blood and bone marrow,
according to Ferrara.
Ferrara said though Glick has
been working with research on

Bz-423 for about five years, it
wasn't until about three years ago
that they began their collaborative
research.
Drawing on his extensive expe-
rience with bone marrow trans-
plants, Ferrara assisted Glick in
devising an experimental system
that would track the effects the
drug has on the individual cells.
The findings of the study "show
that only the activated ones that
were causing disease were the
ones that this drug killed, whereas
other normal cells would not be
killed," Ferrara said.
He said he believes it will be at
least one year before clinical tri-
als of the drug will be released to
patients. According to Ferrara,
the drug will provide a treatment

different from others currently on
the market because it's being test-
ed on mice instead of in a test tube.
Rackham student Daniel Wahl,
a third-year medical student
and one of the co-authors of the
recently published paper, echoed
Ferrara's sentiments about the
significance of the new drug and
wrote in an e-mail interview that
the drug will provide more effec-
tive treatment for patients.
"This research is very excit-
ing for the future of bone marrow
transplantation," Wahl wrote.
"If the beneficial effects we have
observed in animal models can
be translated into the clinic, this
new drug could be an important
new tool to treatthe side effects of
bone marrow transplantation."

A hole in the 'ridge'
Students and legislators must stop welfare abuse
Bridge Card abusers, beware - an end to fraudulent food assis-
tance may be near. State Rep. David Agema (R-Grandville),
chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees fund-
ing for the Department of Human Services, is looking to end Bridge
Card abuse among college students. But legislators should be cautious'
when placing restrictions on a program that helps more than 1 million
Michigan residents annually. While the state should further inves-
tigate the consequences of alleged Bridge Card abuse, students and
retailers must act responsibly and stop abusing the welfare program.

Lt y the way, these are just
theories," my economics
professor casually noted,
implying that the mathematical rela-
tionships on the
lecture slide may
not reflect real-
ity. I imagined
myself stand-
ing up in my
lecture hall of °
300, exclaiming:
So why are we
spending all our ERIK
time learning the TORENBERG
ins and outs of
these theories?
Why aren't we also analyzing the
frameworks from which they rest?
A conversation with an alumn
exacerbated my intellectual discom-
fort. He told me he never used any
specific thing he learned from eco-
nomic classes. But don't worry about
that, he implied. Economics taught
him how to solve problems. I see the
relation - if he meant solving more
types of economic problems. But if
he meant solving typical problems
he may confront at work, I don't see
a clear connection. Although, some-
times it's nice to imagine myself
gaining four problem solving points
on my 0 -100 problem solvingmeter,
ready to tackle all sorts of problems
as I exit Lurch Hall every other day.
Now, I don't question the impor-
tance and applicability of quantita-
tive abilities. But such a justification
for a concentration hides the fact
that we economics majors have little
use for the theories we work so hard
to ingrain in our minds.
Most economics majors don't
mind. The reality is that many stu-
dents major in economics because it
ostensibly provides instant credibil-
ity for future employers. Financially,
it's practical.
But besides serving as a stepping-
stone to professional success, the
economics department also prides
itself on imparting to its students a
valuable framework for evaluating
the world around them. And it cer-
tainly does. But students will get an
even more nuanced understanding
of economic matters if they supple-

ment this lens with others.
For example, we study the Laf-
fer Curve - the tradeoff between
equality and efficiency - without
debating how much efficiency, how
much equality and why? The soci-
etal costs of inequality cannot easily
be quantified. Analyzing economic
issues from multiple lenses would
providea more complete picture. But
we don't discuss or debate this infor-
mation - we just consume it. Upper
level classes may offer comprehen-
sive analysis of these issues, but stu-
dents have to clear high hurdles to
access them.
While hammering in economic
theories, introductory classes actu-
ally disillusion many students who
care about economic problems. So
these students take social science
classes, typically heavily based on
content. It seems that these stu-
dents are more interested in eco-
nomic issues than actual economics
majors, even though they some-
times wallow in the anecdotal. They
claim that the dry and conservative
nature of the introductory classes
repelled them, but the heavy math
may have been the real reason. If so,
they are committing the same ideo-
logical error but in reverse: They're
prescribing social medications to
economic events without under-
standing the underlying economic
conditions.
There's one group of people pro-
posing solutions without an under-
standing of business and statistics.
There's another group of people
trying to quantify and model every-
thing without a moral framework to
prioritize their results. Comprehen-
sive analysis requires both of these
skill sets. Students typically only
have one.
An interdisciplinary programthat
evaluates events through economic,
philosophical and historical lenses
will instill these qualitative and
quantitative tools in its students.
Bringing together these depart-
ments might be bureaucratically dif-
ficult, but that shouldn't be a major
roadblock. Such a bridgingcan actu-
ally send a message: The Univer-
sity promotes an interdisciplinary

approach to solving interconnected
problems.
One model already exists: Philos-
ophy, Politics and Economics. Origi-
nating at the University of Oxford,
PPE - which seeks to combine these
areas of study and examine the areas
where they intersect - is offered at
several leading universities around
the world. This University has flirt-
ed with implementing this program
before, but nothing has come to frui-
tion yet. Departments may respond
if its students demonstrate interest,
so e-mail your department if you'd 4
like to see such a program.
Economics

is more
than math.

Reports released by the DHS state that
10,000 to 18,000 Michigan college students
were receiving up to $200 a month in food
assistance from the state during the 2009-
2010 school year, according to a Feb. 1 article
in the Lansing State Journal. Agema and other
legislators are growing concerned that a large
portion of Bridge Card users have found loop-
holes in the application and are cashing in on
unneeded state assistance, though lawmak-
ers don't know the exact number of abusers.
Other proposals capping welfare benefits have
been introduced in the last month in an effort
to decrease the $1.8 billion budget deficit the
state faces the next fiscal year.
Before students apply for a Bridge Card,
they should remember that the purpose of
the program is to assist low-income fami-
lies, not to pay for unnecessary products.
Just because a loophole exists, doesn't mean
that it should be exploited. When students
take advantage of the program, they're tak-
ing money away from one of the most eco-
nomically depressed states in the country. In
addition to wasting tsaiernE dollars, abuse
destroys the credibility of a Bridge Card pro-
gram that millions of Michigan residents rely
on to pay for essentials.
Retailers must also be responsible when
it comes to Bridge Card use and shouldn't

view the program as a way to gain custom-
ers. According to state Rep. Rashida Tlaib
(D-Detroit), grocery stores across Michigan
are encouraging college students to apply for
the program simply to boost their own sales.
While this may seem like a harmless promo-
tion to retailers, urging students who may not
need the card to apply comes at the expense of
the less fortunate who will suffer if the pro-
gram is slashed.
While legislators plan their sting operation
against fraudulent card users, they should
consider changing the procedure to apply for
the Bridge Card. According to Agema, allow-
ing applicants to apply online instead of vis-
iting a local DHS office makes it easier for
students to get Bridge Cards they don't need.
Other lawmakers have claimed that the sim-
plicity of the application allows students to
lie about their financial situation. Lawmak-
ers should consider adding eligibility criteria
for the program. There needs to be a system
in place that limits abuse, while still allowing
those who need the card - including college
students - to have access to aid.
When it comes to putting an end to Michi-
gan's food fraud, students, retailers and law-
makers need to act ethically and make sure
that those who need help - not those who can
work the system - are getting it.

I don't envision unrelated intro-
ductory classes in the three different
departments. I envision interdisci-
plinary courses where students use
economic and philosophical lenses
to analyze problems - where they
converse as well as calculate.
Those who want to go into finance
or academia will still get the full
dose of economics. We certainly
need economics specialists. But
generalists are important, too. PPE
may foster more socially conscious
economists like Joseph Stiglitz and
Jeffrey Sachs. Or thinkers like Adam
Smiths and David Hume. There was
a time when our economists were
also our philosophers.
Perhaps a future alumnus will
come back and tell students that in
addition to learning how to evaluate
data, she also learned how to evalu-
ate texts and ideas. She understood
economic affairs in political and his-
torical contexts, cultivating a genu-
ine interest in the process. She'll
recommend PPE wholeheartedly,
redefining what it means to think
practically about one's major.

Well played, Mr. President

Americans disagree on virtually every
political topic. We, as a country, don't see
eye to eye on abortion, gun control, govern-
ment spending, gay marriage, immigration or
practically an infinite number of other divid-
ing issues. We don't agree on what the role
of government should be or how the Con-
stitution should be interpreted. Short of an
absolute tragedy, Americans have never been
in complete universal agreement on certain
political matters. Yet when it comes to China,
we can all agree on one thing: It scares the
hell out of us.
It's no secret that China is growing at an
unprecedented rate. Within just a couple
decades, China has reinvented itself and has
become a global superpower. Recently sur-
passing Japan as the world's second largest
economy, China has begun to encroach on
America's international dominance, leaving
many to believe that China will soon be the
world's major economic power. According
to a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll,
38 percent of Americans believe that China
will be the world leader in 20 years or less.
This statistic, compared to only 35 percent
of Americans who believe that the United
States will remain in power as the global eco-
nomic leader, causes many to show concern.
Those who are most concerned are unde-
niably our elected officials. Politicians from
both sides of the spectrum are desperately
seeking ways that we as a country can ensure
our continued dominance over China. Few
people understand this more than President
Barack Obama. Perhaps it's because of this
universal fear that Obama brought up China
on four separate occasions in his 2011 State of
the Union address, while also speaking about
growing Asian countries an additional three
times. This wasn't an accident. Obama wants
to make sure no one forgets about China's
growing dominance anytime soon.
As he embarks on the second half of his
first term as president, Obama has made it
readily apparent that he plans on heightening

America's investment in technology, educa-
tion and renewable energy. Unfortunately for
him, with the Republican-dominated House
of Representatives, funds for these expensive
endeavors won't be easily approved. Obama
has realized that the Republicans will never
approve the spending that he wants, so he has
to think of drastic ways to garner the support
that he needs. By reminding America of Chi-
na's threat, Obama is in effect trying to scare
Republicans into approving his spending in
order to keep up with China's continuous
growth. "China is building faster trains and
newer airports. Meanwhile, when our own
engineers graded our nation's infrastructure,
they gave us a D," he said in his address.
Obama knows just as well as the Repub-
licans do that to save American jobs and to
ensure our continued dominance, Republi-
cans will be willing to approve spending that
they normally would be hesitant to sign off
on. This is a brilliant political ploy because
this may very well be Obama's only chance
to gain the support he needs to approve the
projects he wishes to enact.
In reality, no one loses from this under-
taking. We as a country desperately need
improvements such as a high-speed rail transit
system, improved broadband speeds and fur-
ther investment in renewable energies. China
will surpass us very soon unless we make cer-
tain investments. As Obama reiterated in his
speech, "Just recently, China became home to
the world's largest private solar research facil-
ity, and the world's fastest computer."
America must act soon because if we wish
to ensure our continued global dominance, we
have to not only keep up with China's advance-
ment, but also surpass them in investments for
the future. The president's focus point in his
State of the Union was that "We need to out-
innovate, out-educate and out-build the rest of
the world." This was Obama's way of saying:
We need to catch up with China.

Supporters of a University-sponsored study abroad
program in Israel argue that programs would pro-
vide greater academic opportunities for students
and enhance the University's global competitiveness.
While it's refreshing to see University students taking
an interest in the Middle East, there are several poten-
tial concerns that deserve consideration.
Steven Zuckerman, a Public Policy representative
for MSA and supporter of the initiative, insists that the
program is "not a political statement," according to a
Jan. 24 Michigan Daily article. But the petition's spon-
sor, WolvPAC, is "a strictly political group committed
to strengthening the US-Israel relationship through
dialogue and lobbying," according to its constitution.
The lack of consistency on the part of the sponsors is
especially concerning given the growing national move-
ment calling for an academic and cultural boycott of
Israel. To be clear, there are certainly those whose criti-
cisms of Israel reflect nothing more than thinly veiled
anti-Jewish prejudice. But this doesn't imply that there
can be no legitimate and morally grounded criticism of
Israeli policy and behavior.
One of the foremost proponents of boycott is a man
whose human rights record is unassailable: Nobel
Laureate, South African anti-apartheid advocate and
Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The same man in 2008
was honored with the University's Wallenberg Medal,
which requires "unmatched heroism, courage and
self-sacrifice in the protection and rescue of the per-
secuted."
"Israeli universities are an intimate part of the
Israeli regime," Tutu said in an article in Times Live.
"While Palestinians are not able to access universities
and schools, Israeli universities produce the research,
technology, arguments and leaders for maintainiigthe
occupation."
Many of us - myself included - may find it difficult
to reconcile the idea of academic boycott with our com-
mitment to academic freedom. A stronger rationale for
opposing University-sponsored study abroad in Israel
is that such programs may unintentionally further dis-
crimination and violate the University's commitment
to equal opportunity.
Last month, for example, Human Rights Watch
reported, "Palestinians face systematic discrimination
merely because of their race, ethnicity and national ori-
gin, depriving them of electricity, water, schools and
access to roads." The situation within the Jewish state, of
which around 20 percent of citizens are Muslim, is even
worse. According to Haaretz.com, "segregation of Jews
and Arabs in 2010 Israel is absolute."
Supporters argue that University-sponsored study
abroad in Israel would offer many academic and cultural
opportunities. Under Israel's current border policy, how-

ever, thousands of University students would risk being
effectively barred from these opportunities.
Accordingto the U.S. State Department, "U.S. citizens
whom Israeli authorities suspect of being of Arab, Middle
Eastern, or Muslim origin ... may face additional, often
time-consuming, and probing questioning by immigra-
tion and border authorities, or may even be denied entry
into Israel."
It gets worse: "U.S. citizens have been detained and/
or arrested at the airport and at other border crossings
on suspicion of security-related offenses... In some cases,
Israeli authorities have denied American citizens access
to U.S. consular officers, lawyers, and even family mem-
bers during temporary detention."
These are very real concerns. Last January, an
American. Harvard University law student of Egyp-
tian descent was detained upon landing in Israel and
eventually deported after she refused border officials'
requests to search her e-mail. A similar case involv-
ing a Wayne State University student occurred a few
months later.
Will all University students - regardless of race, reli-
gion or political beliefs - have equal opportunities to
participate in the proposed study abroad program? What
measures will the University take to ensure that certain
segments of the student body aren't disenfranchised in
the new program?
The proponents of the initiative, thus far, have failed
to demonstrate sensitivity to these concerns. In his let-
ter to the editor, LSA Junior Jacob Steinerman speaks
of Israel as an idyllic tourist hotspot. "Where else can
you go skiing, hiking, scuba diving," he wrote (Study
abroad in Israel, 1/26/2011).
If we truly wish to enhance the learning experience
outside the classroom, we must transcend such sugar-
coated views of the region. It's also likely that University-
sponsored study abroad in Israel will be perceived as a
political statement and may result in our inadvertently
endorsing segregation and de facto discrimination.
The opportunity to study in Israel and Palestine
would provide an unparalleled learning experience.
Why not a joint Palestinian and Israeli study abroad?
Surprisingly, the idea isn't as novel as it may seem -
American University and George Mason already have
similar programs up and running.
By partnering with a Palestinian as well as an Israeli
university, the University would signal its commit-
ment to promoting dialogue as opposed to monologue.
Moreover, we will move one step closer to realizing
the promise of the University's mission - "developing
leaders and citizens who will challenge the present
and enrich the future."

NGP needs a home

MothUP takes off again

Sony's newest toy
might not have
an audience
By SHIN HIEFTJE
Daily Arts Writer
Sony's recently announced
new portable Playstation device,
codenamed "Next Generation
Portable," is an absolute beast
of a machine. With a bright
five-inch OLED touchscreen, a
quad-core computer processor
and graphics processor, the NGP
lends itself to nearly PS3 level
graphic capabilities.
Sony showed off a fully-
fledged version of "Metal Gear
Solid 4" on the portable to give
an example ofwhat was possible.
Unlike the original PSP, the NGP
also has two analog sticks for
better control methods. There
is a touch pad on the back of
the device as well, much like a
laptop mouse pad. On top of all
that, there are also two cameras,
motion sensors, a gyroscope and
accelerometer, GPS capabilities
and 3G wireless support built in.
All of this sounds incred-
ible, and from a technological
1 perspective it is incredible. But
 stepping back to a consumer's
perspective, one can't help but
wonder who it's actually for.
Sony's main pitch seems to be
of the console's ability to play
PS3 games, touting the power
and graphics of franchises like
"Uncharted" and "Killzone" on
their small screen.
But wait - don't those people
who want to play PS3 games

already have a PS3? Though
Sony hasn't announced a price,
most industry veterans are spec-
ulating the price between $300
and $400. Are PS3 owners really
willing to spend the amount
they paid for their PS3 for a por-
table version of the same thing?
Wouldn't a consumer deciding
between a PS3 and an NGP favor
the version that could be played
on a big screen TV? Considering
most Americans travel by car,
few are in a position where it
would be convenient to play on-
the-go.
The NGP would certainly
make sense for Japan - people
commute bytrain constantly and
over long distances, and often
have tight livingspaces. An NGP
might be preferable consider-
ing the Japanese might not have
room for a large TV and a PS3.
But on the American front, there
aren't that many people taking
public transportation outside
those in major cities. Perhaps
kids riding in back seats would
be an ideal demographic, but
that doesn't seem like the market
Sony is targeting, since the most
prominently featured titles are
shooters.
.Of course, there is the touch
screen functionality, which adds
a new element of gameplay. Sony
has saidthatthe games will come
on "new media," but hasn't been
clear on the kind of flash mem-
ory the device has. Regardless,
digitally downloadable games
are now possible, meaning we
could now see low-price touch
games in the vein of the iPhone.
But it comes back to the origi-
nal question: Who is it really for?

COURTESY OF SONY
Don't the people who like touch
games already have an iPhone
or iPod Touch? Why would they
buy the NGP when their primary
device already has so much func-
tionality? And it's not even like
the NGP would be able to replace
the iPhone - while the NGP
does have 3G capabilities, Sony
has explicitly stated that it can-
not be used as a mobile phone.
Despite this, maybe all this
negative speculation will ulti-
mately be irrelevant. The fact
remains that the NGP could be a
worldwide hit for years to come.
Perhaps developers will cre-
ate incredible new games using
motion sensors, cameras and
great dual joystick controls all
at the same time. The problem is
that Sony hasn't really shown off
many games that utilize all the
interesting parts of the console.
The touch pad on the back can be
rubbed in the new "Uncharted"
game to climb vines - which is
neat, but not especially exciting.
Like everygame platformever
released, it will all come down
to the pricing and the software.
If it's affordable and companies
come out with top-of-the-line
creative games, it's easy to see
this device doing gangbusters.
But if it's $400 and there are
mainly iPhone games or portable
versions of PS3 games, then it's
not hard to imagine consumers
saving their money.

MothUP, an initiative encouraging

more voices to be heard. Tomorrow,
MothUP will hold its third story-

"missed connections."
The Moth is a non-profit orga-

While in New York, Green wanted
to recreate the evenings when
moths would be drawntothe lights
where he and his friends shared
stories in Georgia. Green's Moth

such as Moth Mainstage, which is
a national tour, and the Moth Sto-
rySLAM program, an open-mic
storytelling competition in Los
Angeles, Chicago, Detroit and New

York. The rules are fairly simple
at each event: A theme is given at

are drawn from a hat. No notes are

Little 'Vision' in nun biopic

By MACKENZIE METER
For the Daily
At the time of the Crusades,
corporal punishment in religious
orders was commonplace. This self-
punishment
sometimes **
consisted of
wearing a Vision: From the
tight, spiked Life of Hildegard
belt called
a cilice, the Von Bingen
barbs of At the Michigan
which dug
into the flesh Zeitgeist
and caused
excruciating pain. Without liken-
ing "Vision: From the Life of Hil-
degard von Bingen" to exactly the
kind of agony that a cilice would
elicit, suffice it to say the film's
length and meandering plotline

bring forth a similar sense of inter-
minable, unbearable discomfort.
"Vision," a subtitled German-
language film written and directed
by Margarethe von Trotta, intri-
cately and listlessly weaves the
account of real-life Catholic abbess
and canonized saint Hildegard von
Bingen (Barbara Sukowa, "The
Invention of the Curried Sausage").
Set in a German monastery about
900 years ago, the film provides a
glimpse into the daily lives of some
of the most pious people in the
world without assuming the role of
a documentary. However, the film
never provides any background-on
von Bingen or why she deserves to
have a movie made about her in the
first place, so the result is a dark,
drawn-out picture without any
sense of purpose or resolution.
Hildegard von Bingen is

acknowledged in real life as a ven-
erable philosopher, Christian mys-
tic, composer, writer and visionary.
But the film instead focuses almost
entirely on the visions she experi-
enced since early childhood - com-

There's a difference between communicating ideas and experiencing them. It's the
difference between memorizing a foreign language and thinking in one. Between
studying ruins and excavating them. Between analyzing dreams and living them. The
difference is huge. And it's the very essence of the University of Chicago Summer
Session. Where students are engaged at every level-intellectually, socially, personally,
and professionally. Where you can benefit from the value of taking university courses

From Page 5A
entrusted to be the mother of
another young girl, also named
Jutta. Years pass and Jutta Sr.
eventually dies, leaving von Bin-
gen to the post of abbess, which
she accepts with chagrin. Mean-
while, Jutta Jr. (Lena Stoltz, "Ein
Teil von mir") spends her time
being jealous of the success of her
"sister" within the religious com-
munity, seemingly forgetting the
lesson that their "mother" taught
them: "Envy is ugly and misshap-
en."
Envy may be ugly and mis-
shapen, but to von Bingen, nar-
cissism certainly is not. She is
obsessed, somewhat creepily, with
a young nun named Richardus
von Stade (Hannah Herzsprung,
"The Reader") who comes to the
monastery with the sole purpose
of dogging after von Bingen until
the day she dies - something she

does extremely well. Besides her
selfish attachment to von Stade,
von Bingen's self-serving behavior
continues after one of her visions
tells her to write down all she sees
and hears, which soon turns into
an all-consuming obsession which
takes up everyone's time. From
here, the movie continues in its
forward march of drudgery, teas-
ing the audience with the promise
of von Bingen's death and a conclu-
sion to the film, only to zoom in on
a flutter of an eyelid, resurrecting
her for another 45 minutes. At this
point, the only saving grace for the
film might be the performances,
but even those fall disappoint-
ingly flat. The only breaks from
the monotony are the interactions
between von Bingen and her monk
"friend" Volmar (Heino Ferch,
"Run Lola Run"), even if their
mouth-kissing is a little uncom-
fortable to watch.
However, the film does have
some surprising relevance to mod-
ern times. Von Bingen is often

called the "devil" because of her
visions and her reliance on pagan
modes ofhealingsuchas herbs and
crystals, demonstrating humani-
ty's unfailing fear of the unknown.
Moreover, the double standard
set against women that still exists
today is embodied in a scenario
between a few canoodlers in the
cloister: After a young nun breaks
her vow of chastity with a certain
young monk and subsequently
takes her own life when ordered
to leave the hermitage, the monk
in charge of the monastery damns
her to hell, whereas he holds no
grudge against the boy who got
her in trouble. Some things never
change.
All in all, audience members
might leave the theater asking
themselves if they've actually just
seen a movie. Only saint aficiona-
dos will be able to connect with
the story in a religious sense at
all - save for drawing a metaphor
between the lengthy, interminable
plotline and Purgatory.

with the Moth's message. This
past fall she received permission
to start her own chapter of the
club and hold competitions at the
University. She brought together
a few of her friends and with
the help of some advertising, the
groupbegan to take form.
LSA senior Alex Green, a
friend of Smith who's lived with
her for the past two years in a
co-op, felt particularly connect-
ed to The Moth's agenda.
"Everyone has a story," Green
said. "Maybe not everyone is
going to write a poem, tell a poem
or write a story, but everyone has
a story."
MothUP has already had two
successful events. The first, held
at the Work Gallery on South
State St., had the apropos theme
of "first time," while the second
was "out of the ordinary" and

gathered in the UMMA com-
mons.
These evenings featured sto-
ries whose topics ranged from
"The first time I thought my
dad was gay" to "The first time
I thought I was going to die" to
"Meeting up with people that I
met through the Internet."
"There is something special
about how the events happen,"
Green said. "They are very hon-
est. You get an extremely raw
window into someone's life. The
best stories - whether they are
funny, sad or just true - are the
ones that have a deep emotional
component. And people find
ways to confess such that you are
put into their shoes, and you can
really feel what they are feeling
no matter the emotion."
These events have signifi-
cantly begun integrating the
Ann Arbor populace - provid-
ing a place for both University
students and locals to share
their stories.

"Part of our vision of bring-
ing (MothUP) to Ann Arbor was
to create community engage-
ment between U of M students
and the Ann Arbor community,"
Smith said. "I noticed that there
is a riff between U of M students
and the larger community, so
this is a way to bring everyone
together."
As this newly assembled group
looks onward, it hopes to hold
story workshops as well so that
people can continue to expand
and develop their stories. In
addition, MothUP plans to hold a
grand slam competition in April,
which will consist of the win-
ners from the previous events4
throughout the year.
Smith hopes that tomor-
row's MothUP competition will
encourage people to continue lis-
tening to their neighbors.
"People don't go to the events
because there is someone famous
or important there; Instead, they
go to hear each other," she said.

International addition
making strides for'M'

Male practice players help Blue
prepare for stronger opponents

By MATT SPELICII
For the Daily
In recent years, there's been a
major influx of international stu-
dents into collegiate men's tennis.
This year, the top three teams
in the preseason - Virginia, USC
and Tennessee - each boast a
roster nearly half filled with top-
tier international players. With
the exception of Antarctica, every
continent is represented among
these international additions, all
wielding rackets.
While the Michigan men's ten-
nis team has traditionally been
comprised mostly of Americans,
this year the Wolverines made an
international addition of their own
- New Zealand-born freshman,
Barrett Franks.
Though Franks has provento be
a strong addition to the team, win-
ning four of his last five matches,
Michigan coach Bruce Berque still
has confidence that his team can
remain competitive with mostly
American players.
"The problem is that a lot of the
international players are border-
line legit when it comes to ama-
teurism," Berque said Monday. "A
lot of them are older, failed profes-
sionals who come to America to
use this system to get an educa-
tion. I feel there are enough good
players in this country, and if you
are willing to take the time to work
with them, they can learn to be
competitive at a high level.
"When we recruit internation-
ally we look for the best players
that are also true amateurs, and
Barrett fits that perfectly."
Playing tennis at Michigan has
given Franks the opportunity to
study economics and to get a taste
of life in America, which for him
almost exclusively revolves around
the Green Bay Packers. Franks has
been a cheesehead since the Pack-
ers' playoff win over the Bears
in 2008, during his first visit to
America. But he is adamant about
not being called a bandwagon fan,
especially after Sunday's Super
Bowl win over the Steelers.
Outside the Packers and his eco-
nomics homework, Franks's life
is all about tennis, a sport he has
been playing since the age of four.
But in his hometown of Christ-

church, men's tennis is relatively
obscure in comparison to rugby,
New Zealand's premier sport.
While Franks is the first to
admit that he's not built for rugby
with his 6-foot-4, spindly frame,
he says he didn't seek out tennis
as an alternative. His start in the
sport was actually quite an acci-
dent.
"My dad loved playing squash,
but he realized that it was too hard
of a game to play at four years old,
so in the meantime he decided
to introduce me to tennis until I
could grow up and play squash,"
Franks said. "I'm pretty positive
he also did it to tire me out. But
overall, the more I won, the moreI
began to really love the sport."
Unable to find suitable com-
petition in Christchurch, Franks
joined the junior national team to
"The more I
won, the more I
began to really
love the sport."
fill that void and compete in the
international circuit.
"Being on that team allowed me
to see the world," Franks said. "As
I grew older, I would travel farther
and farther away from home for
tournaments. It was a great expe-
rience that both made me more
competitive as well as more trav-
eled."
Despite Franks's early success
in the preseason, Berque has been
helping to improve some critical
elements of his game to get him
ready for the regular season.
"Coming from New Zealand,
where he was probably the best
player in his area, it's good for him
to be out here competing against
people as good as him every day,"
Berque said. "We're currently
working on his backhand and
how he handles adversity dur-
ing a match ... but he has already
improved a great deal. He is just
scratching the surface of what he
can do here at Michigan."

By KEVIN RAFTERY
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan women's basket-
ball coach Kevin Borseth holds
a tryout at the beginning of each
year - but it's most likely not the
type of tryout most people think
of when they think women's bas-
ketball.
It's a tryout for male players
who are interested in helping out
at practice, running drills against
the team.
"Guys give you a look because
they're quicker, stronger, more
athletic," Borseth said after prac-
tice on Tuesday. "We're just look-
ing for players that understand
basketball, that have some skill.
We might need a big guy to stand
behind (our players) and defend,
or maybe some little guards who
can penetrate."
Playing against bigger oppo-
nents has become the norm for
the undersized Wolverines (7-4
Big Ten, 14-9 overall), whose tall-
est starting player, sophomore
forward Rachel Sheffer, is only
6-foot-1.
Having practice players around
to imitate players like Ohio State's
6-foot-4, three-time defending
Big Ten Player of the Year Jan-
tel Lavender or Michigan State's
rebounding machine Lykendra
Johnson, has paid dividends this
season.
Michigan has beaten a multi-
tude of bigger teams this season,
and part of that success has to be
credited to the effort of Borseth's
practice players. Phil Wendland,
the team'sgraduate manager, is in
charge of the practice players.
"(Borseth) scouts the upcom-
ing opponent, and he'll see if
there's a girl who drives left, (for
example)," Wendland said Tues-
day. "If she can drive left, we
have some of our practice players
come in and drive left. They're
important to simulate other
players on other teams."
But Borseth hasn't always
been an advocate of a male
practice squad. During his first
year as coach at UW-Green Bay,
his team started off the year
3-8. After the eighth loss, he
decided to get rid of the prac-
tice team.
The Phoenix went on to fin-

Sophomore forward Rachel Sheffer is Michigan's tallest starting player at 6-foot-t.

ish 19-10 that year and earned a
berth to the NCAA Tournament.
"I was never really a major
advocate of using men's players,
because I thought that it came at
the expense of your other play-
ers," he said. "I think (that year
with UW-Green Bay) is really
where my opinion came from.
"You want your players to get
as many reps in practice as you
can get, and sometimes when you
have male players, they don't get
that."
But this year, with a depleted
squad that now features just 10
active players on the roster, a
male practice squad is about as
important for the Wolverines.
Borseth and his staff have

found 12 male players who rotate
days throughout the week in
which they practice with the
team. The players are asked to
perform different roles in prac-
tice, depending on who Michigan
will be playing in its next game.
"We use them for individual
workouts, skill drills," Borseth
said. "We'll put them in to defend
five-on-five, and sometimes we'll
run the otherteam's plays. We use
them in alot of capacities."
But the players are more than
just robots doing what they're
told on the court. For many of
them, playing on the practice
squad gives them the opportunity
to continue playingthe sport they
grew up with. All of the players

played varsity basketball in high
school.
"They bring so much more to
practice (with) their intensity,"
Sheffer said. "They shove me,
they push me, they're not afraid
to get at me. They're not afraid
to hurt you or do anything to you
- and that makes you a better
player."
And there might be a little
extra motivation for the guys,too.
"I think their mindset coming
into practice is a lot different than
a girl's (mindset)," Sheffer said.
"(To) them, going against girls is
just like, 'Well, we can't get beat.'
"So just knowing that they
don't want to get beat, we want to
go at them hard."

Defensive stalwart Plunkett
explodes on offensive end

Senior earns
CPWA Player of the
Week honors after
11-point weekend
By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Writer
Her teammates call her
Grandma.
But during Michigan's six-
game sweep at the two-day
UC-Santa Barbara Winter Invi-
tational tournament, senior
Ryley Plunkett didn't exactly
1 conjure up the image of a sweet
old lady. Instead, she was an
offensive force, racking up five
assists and six goals, including
the game-winner against San
Diego State.
Her efforts earned her the
CWPA Western Division Player
of the Week title.
Not too bad for a defender.
Forgive her teammates if they
sound a little surprised at Plun-
kett's offensive explosion.
"It was crazy because she
really is ... a great defender,"
senior Lauren Orth said. "But
then she literally just came right
out of her shell and was scoring
goals left and right."
Plunkett has always been an
* important piece of the puzzle
for the Wolverines.
Her contributions, though,
have almost always come in
Michigan's half of the pool, not
in the offensive zone. According
to Michigan coach Matt Ander-
son, Plunkett is the team's best
defender.

In three seasons with the
Wolverines, Plunkett has played
in over 40 games each of her sea-
sons at Michigan, and totaled a
career-high 12 goals last year.
She produced half of that total
in just two days in California.
So what happened at the Invi-
tational?
"She's a senior, and I think
she realizes that she wants to be
out there not just for defensive
purposes only," Anderson said.
"Showing that she's not afraid
to score the ball will allow me to
play her more."
According to Anderson, she
showed her willingness to score
before the team played then-No.
11 San Diego State on the second
day of the tournament. The day
before, Plunkett recorded her
second career hat trick against
UC San Diego. With time wind-
ing down and the team going on
a power play, Anderson called a
timeout. Then, he decided to do
something he had never done
before.
He kept Plunkett in the game
for the power play.
"In the UC-San Diego game
... she stepped up and scored
that first goal, and ... we had the
(UC-San Diego) coach yelling
for them to go guard (Plunkett),
which opened up our other
players," Anderson said. "That
showed enough confidence that
against San Diego State, when I
called a time out with 2:30 left, I
had (Plunkett) in for the power
play. The previous three years
that wouldn't have been the
case."
The decision paid off, as
Plunkett netted the game-win-

ner that gave Michigan a 12-11
victory.
According to Orth, Plun-
kett actually has one of the
best shots on the team. But for
an Anderson-coached team,
defense always comes first, and
Plunkett best serves the team
when she is defending.
"(Plunkett) definitely puts
the team first no matter what
she does," Orth said. "Every-
thing she does in the water is to
help a teammate or to cover for
a teammate, and she's always
thinking about the team."
Some of her teammates,
though, might ask her for just
one more thing: a later bedtime.
During freshman year, when
practices ended at nine, Plun-
kett would be in bed as soon as
possible, earning her "grandma"
moniker.
"Riley would be in bed, cov-
ers - she wears an eye sleep-
ing mask too, so she'd have that
on - sleeping by 10," Orth said.
"Every night. She would never
hang out late with us."
The nickname caught on and
spread throughout the team.
And how does Plunkett feel
about being called "Grandma?"
"I just got used to it and it
ended up as just a big joke now,"
Plunkett said. "I like it. It's a
funny nickname."
But Plunkett said that she
didn't always feel so positive
about the moniker. She was
worried that people would think
she's boring.
But with the way she's been
keeping busy on both sides of
the ball, that shouldn't be a
problem.

Michigan looking for payback, pivotal home win

By CHANTEL JENNINGS
Daily Sports Editor
It's been three weeks since the
Michigan men's basketball team
faced off against Northwestern.
That means it's been three
weeks since the Wolverines (4-7
Big Ten, 14-10 overall) played one
of their worst games of the season.
But since that game, Michigan,
despite going 3-5, has found itself
with an opportunity to win in the
final five minutes of each game.
When playing the Wildcats in
Evanston last month, the Wol-
verines allowed Northwestern to
take a commanding first-half lead
before being outscored by just one
point in the second half.
The Wildcats' first-half surge
was led by junior forward John
Shurna. Despite suffering a high

ankle sprain, he scored 22 points
in the first stanza, which allowed

ern's cushion Northwestern

heavily to the
Wolverines' inability to mount
a successful comeback in what
ended up being one of the worst
games the youngteam has played.
"I think we're a better team
than we were amonth ago, there's

no question about it," Michigan
coach John Beilein said Tuesday.
"But they are too."
In the past three weeks, Michi-
gan has gone 3-2 with its only
losses coming to then-No. 15 Min-
nesota and No. 1 Ohio State. But
most important, the Wolverines
have reestablished themselves
in the middle of the Big Ten pack
with their three victories, and a
victory over the Wildcats could
prove to be a defining moment
come March.
And if there's one thing the
Wildcats (4-7, 14-8) are synony-
mous with, it's executing a quick
offense. Northwestern is known
for running the traditional Princ-
eton offense - a strategy that
consists of constant motion and
cutting - that most teams have
trouble keeping up with, let alone

defending, the offensive motion.
"If every team could get their
team to run their cuts like North-
western, all the scoring, every-
where in the country would go up
because they run their offense at
a high, high speed," Beilein said.
"It's the exact opposite of what
the perception would be, that this
Princeton (style) offense is run for
guys who can't play."
Junior guard Stu Douglass,
who had a team-high 17 points
against Northwestern last month,
said no matter how many times
he watches game tape, it's still
difficult to not get caught up in
the constant action of Northwest-
ern's offense. But he's not worried
about the younger guys on the
team keepingtheir poise this time
around.
Recently, Shurna hasn't been
as effective as he was against
the Wolverines. After suffering a
concussion in the Wildcats' game
against then-No. 16 Minnesota,
the junior sat out against No. 1
Ohio State. He returned to the
floor against Illinois on Saturday,
where Northwestern scraped by
the Illini in a one-point win, but
only contributed eight points.
The Wolverines have been
explicit about their intentions to
only look at the game in front of
them, but with just seven games
left in the regular season, Michi-
gan knows that it stands on the
bubble of the Big Ten - arguably
the most competitive conference
in the country.
Just one and a half games sepa-
rate fourth-place Illinois and the

JAKE FROMM/Daily
Junior guard Stu Douglass scored 17 points against the Wildcats last month.

ninth-place Wolverines, mean-
ing every game from here on out
could be the difference between a
tournament berth and a very long
offseason.
"We've said it out loud in the
locker room, there's no hiding
from it at all but maybe a little dif-
ference from last year, we've been
able to take it one game at atime
and still not get too scared about
the big picture," Douglass said of
Michigan's postseason chances.

"But this week is crucial for us."
But the first step this week for
the Wolverines is tonight against
Northwestern, which offers a
chance to get ahead in the Big Ten,
but also a chance to redeem them-
selves after what many consider
to be Michigan's worst showing of
the season.
"It's payback and a whole lot of
combinations of things," Douglass
aid. "But payback is maybe the big-
gest."

"Your legacy is your career,
but the senior year is the icing
on the cake. I think (he's) giving
himself a chance to be right up
there with the best players that
have played here."
Those were the exact words
iterated by coach Red Beren-
son at the midway point of the
Michigan hockey team's 2007-
08 season. If a team-leading 33
goals, CCHA Player of the Year
honors and a Hobey Baker award
is any indication, then the icing
was pretty darn good for former
Michigan standout Kevin Porter.
"I think everyone is finding
out who Kevin Porter is," Beren-
son added.
Take a glance at the hardware
and accolades Porter took home
that season, and you'd see a Divi-

But Porter opted to return to
the friendly confines of Yost Ice
Arena for one more go-round,
one more shot at winning a
national title.

BERENSON WORSHIP
IN SECTION 17 AT YOST IC
HOCKEY BECOMES A RELI
BY JOSH HEALY

For me, visits to Yost Ice Arena
are reminiscent of a religious
experience. This sort of phe-
nomenon is difficult to wrap your
head around if you've never been
a very churchy or religious person,
but most people have at least felt
the emotions that I, as a Catholic
atheist, happen to associate with
"religion." So connecting with what
I say might be easier than it seems.
For some years now, I have been
enjoying the hedonistic lifestyle of
a Catholic atheist, yet from time
to time I must admit a slight urge
for an outlet through which to
dispense my religious yearnings.
Mostly, these yearnings are akin to
"Catholic" practice, as they are tied
to my irrepressible love for ritual,
song and consistency in mass gath-
erings. Twelve years of a mostly
happy Catholic education has that
effect on some of us.
For slightly fewer years, I have
been struggling to pinpoint exact-
ly why I love the environment at
Yost so much. I finally connected
spirit with sport at last month's

With the protests in Tahrir
Square and elsewhere still raging,
nothing monumental happened
during Ward's exodus from Egypt.
"It was pretty eventless," Ward
said. "We took a school bus and
waited in traffic forever. Once we
got to the airport, our plane was
delayed for an hour, but nothing
really happened. The military was
in control of everything by that
point."

After Michigan's firstgoal, I was
basking in my post-goal excite-

our classic goal count chant. I find
myself always wanting more goals
and prepared to say so with much
gusto. However, as I stood, some
jackass behind me barked for me to
sit down, reminding me that "You
aren't at Yost!"
Indeed, that was my come to
Berenson moment, as I realized
that it was the first instance when
I had put my "religion" above the
objections and preferences of
those around me, and felt that it
didn't matter since standing up for
a cause I believe in became more
important than the judgment of
others. Call me a jerk or say that
I should've sat down - both are

as uncertain as Egypt's.
Since he graduated, Ward said
he's going to look for a job in Ann

the University, adding he wants to
continue studying Arabic to fulfill
the Flagship Program's require-
ments.
"I'll probably just stay in Ann
Arbor," he said. "I'm waiting to
hear back from graduate schools,
so I'm kind of in an in-between
stage right now."

random student interview by stephenostrowski

Welcome to the Ran-
dom Student Inter-
view, where the line
between journalistic integ-
rity and personal boundaries
becomes blurred. Hello there!
What are your Valentine's Day
plans?
Probably going to hang out with
my girlfriend.
You have a girlfriend?
I do.
How long have you been dating?
About a little over two months.
OK. How did you guys meet?
Uh we met on the snowboard club.
Very cool. Very cool.
In Canada.
Is she a better snowboarder
than you?
Uh no, I don't think so.
So it's good to be cocky?
Uh, S think so.
OK. What are you going to do
for your girlfriend?
Um it's in the process, things are
getting figured out.
The process?
Yeah it's a process.
Sounds like you're going to kid-
nap her.

Uh no, I'm not going to kidnap
her. Maybe. Special kidnap. It's
being worked out in my head.
Are you a presents guy or a date
guy?
A date guy.
OK. So like, roller derby, laser
light show, what kind of date?
Probably dinner.
Dinner?
'm very simple. Old fashioned,
not very original. Probably dress
up in a tuxedo.
What's your idea of dressing
up?
A plaid tuxedo.
Where do you get that?
Salvation Army. Salvation Army
has a large stock of tuxedos.
Really?
They're brilliant.
What size are you?
Medium. Medium and a half.
What size is your girlfriend?
I'm not sure.
Doe she wear a tuxedo too to
these dates or do you change
it up?
Gosh it's in the making. I don't
know.
You don't know? Does this girl-

friend exist?
Yeah she does.
Sounds like she's a blueprint in
your head.
No I just really haven't thought of
plans yet. Dinner is planned. The
plan.
Do you think Valentine's Day
is kind of a Hallmark holiday
or do you embrace it with open
arms?
I think Hallmark is a pretty good
way to talk about Valentine's Day.
Have you thought about going
to Egypt for Valentine's Day?
No. Why would I think that?
There's a lot of crowds over
there. I think there's a concert
going on.
Something going on. Who's play-
ing?
I don't know.
What's his name?
Norah Jones? Might be. I don't
know there's a ton of people
over there.
There's a big guy over there
they're all kind of surrounding.
Really? What's his name?
He's ....
Denzel Washington?

Pharaoh. The Egyptian pharaoh.
Wow, they're getting up in
their pharaoh count. A lot of
pharaohs. Last few questions.
Did you see "Inception?"
I have not. Issit good?
I'm not going to tell you. Have
you seen "Toy Story 3?"
I have not.
Damn. Not even "The Social
Network?"
Not even "The Social Network."
So you don't plan on watching
the Academy Awards?
I guess not. It wouldn't be worth
much to me.
Who's your best picture nomi-
nee for the year?
I have no clue. I'm not up on ...
Last question: Am I dreaming?
Because this is a great inter-
view. Am I dreaming?
Is that a philosophical question?
Are we living in the matrix right
now? Is this all just a dream?
Is that your best picture nomi-
nation - "The Matrix?"
Yes.
OK.

other states. Weltman said she thinks the location of where stu-
dents are fromshould have no effect on their chance of admission.
"I think it should take the best students that apply, no matter
where they live," Weltman said.
Sanders maintained that out-of-state students add diversity to
the student body.
"Though in-state students are very important to the University,
our campus community is rich because it encompasses students
from around the world, which helps to create a rich academic
community of scholars," Sanders wrote.
The College Essay - More than 500 words
Application essays can be repetitive and tedious. Most ask how
you'll use your past experiences to succeed in college, and some
simply askfor a "personal statement." However, some colleges are
using their application essay prompts to attract certain students.
Applicants to the University of Chicago face non-traditional
questions. This year an essay question simply stated: "Find X."
Tufts University applicants can send in video essays. Accord-
ing to an article in The Huffington Post, admissions officials there
said the optional prompts are used to "evaluate student creativity
and originality."
Officials at both colleges said their offbeat essay questions are
used to find unique students.
The University of Michigan asked two questions of their
undergraduate applicants this year:
"Everyone belongs to many different communities and/or
groups defined by (among other things) shared geography, reli-
gion, ethnicity, income, cuisine, interest, race, ideology, or intel-
lectual heritage. Choose one of the communities to which you
belong, and describe that community and your place within it."
And:
"Describe the unique qualities that attract you to the specific
undergraduate College or School (including preferred admission
and dual degree programs) to which you are applying at the Uni-
versity of Michigan. How would that curriculum support your
interests?"
The first question - which asks applicants about what "com-
munities" applicants belong to - has been a prompt for sev-
eral years, The question is usually asked in different forms and
inquires about students' experiences with diversity.
The University added the question in response to an injunction
from the U.S. Supreme Court that ordered the Admissions Office
to cease its affirmative action program.
Several groups - including the Center for Individual Rights
- have raised questions as to whether the application prompt
intends to determine the race of a student in an attempt to find
minority applicants.
Though Sanders would not comment on the concerns of the
question, she wrote that essay questions are an essential part of
a student's application.
"Our essay questions are evaluated each year with input from
the University's president and individual schools and colleges,"
Sanders wrote. "The essay questions provide applicants an oppor-
tunity to share more about who they are and what they will lend
to the University community."

Recruitment gets creative
You probably remember the countless letters, booklets and
e-mails from colleges all over the country. Envelope after enve-
lope, college recruitment mail probably didn't amuse or surprise
you, but some universities are taking a more creative approach to
get noticed.
In order to reach potential students, the University of Chi-
cago sends a series of postcards showcasing the most interbsting
aspects of student life.
According to a recent report in the Chicago Maroon, the post-
card campaign has attracted new students. According to the
report, the university experienced a 10-percent increase in early
action applications after implementingthe program in 2006.
Timmis is a potential applicant who received postcards from
the University of Chicago. He said the postcards were attractive,
and if he met the academic standards of the university, the post-
cards would have encouraged him to apply.
"If I had a 4.0 (GPA) and a35 (ACT score), I would have applied
to Chicago, and I would have wanted to go there," Timmis said.
Weltman also said she received interesting marketing materi-
als from the University of Chicago.
"It almost made me apply," she said.
In an attempt to reinvent the "usual, dull college admissions
video," students at Yale University - as well as alumni in the
Yale undergraduate admissions office - created a 16-minute long
musical video called "That's Why IChose Yale."
The video - whose cast is comprised entirely of Yale students,
faculty and alumni - has had more than 800,000 hits on You-
Tube.
According to a Jan. SO Yale press release, the video is the brain-
child of Andrew Johnson, who is the senior assistant director of
undergraduate admissions at Yale. Johnson wrote in the press
release that he and his team created the video "in the search for a
fresh way to present the college to today's applicants."
In the press release, Johnson wrote that though the video is
intended to be somewhat "cheesy," it shows the many opportuni-
ties Yale has to offer in a way that's more entertaining than the
usual campus information session.
While Yale and the University of Chicago use innovative mar-
keting campaigns, the University of Michigan doesn't partake in
similar endeavors.
And though it doesn't appear that the University does anything
out of the ordinary in its recruiting efforts, Sanders said the Uni-
versity is constantly considering new possibilities for its recruit-
ment campaigns.
"The University continues to evaluate and consider new mar-
keting opportunities," Sanders wrote. "Where we determine the
campaigns may potentially produce a positive impact, we incor-
porate new ideas."
Jeweler-Bentz said some colleges are utilizing social media
like Facebook and Twitter in order to attract students. She said
Universities will successfully increase the number of applicants if
they take advantage of those channels.
"They're really trying to become more tech-savvy and go
through all the channels in order to connect with students," Jew-
eler-Bentz said.

Remember senior year of high school when you got more
mail than ever before in your life? One day's mail would
contain at least one postcard from the armed forces
and several letters from colleges - many you didn't even know
existed.
Hundreds of thousands of students apply to the University of
Michigan every year. Of those, only a fraction gain acceptance
and end up matriculating atthe Ann Arbor campus. But how do
those students decide they want to bleed maize and blue? How
does the University sell itself to bright high school seniors?
Attracting true Wolverines
When most people think of advertising, they think of mass
mailers, widespread e-mails or nationwide television ads.
While the University sends recruitment materials to hun-
dreds of thousands of students, according to a former admis-
sions officer, they're not sending those materials out to just
anyone.
Brie Jeweler-Bentz is an education consultant at the School
Counseling Group in Washington, D.C. Considering that her
job title isn't exactly self-explanatory, she says you can think
of her as a "private guidance counselor."
Jeweler-Bentz is hired by families with children entering
their junior year of high school who need extra help with their
college search. She helps her clients throughout the applica-
tion process, from choosing where to apply to editing their
application essays.
Jeweler-Bentz, the self-described "college matchmaker,"
said not everyone is a perfect fit for the University of Michi-
gan.
When matching students to the University, Jeweler-Bentz
noted that in order for students to stand out among the thou-
sands of applicants, they have to make an effort.
"It's not a school for an introvert," Jeweler-Bentz said. "You
need to be an initiator."
Jeweler-Bentz added that though the University does tend
to have large classes and an exceptionally large student popu-
lation - this year 6,900 freshman are enrolled - it is possible
to have relationships with professors. You just have to try.
"It's one of those big schools that feels smaller to me," Jew-
eler-Bentz said, reflecting on her time as an undergraduate
student here.
In an e-mail interview, Erica Sanders, director of recruit-
ment and operations in the Office of Undergraduate Admis-
sions at the University of Michigan, wrote that prospective
students should embody the characteristics of well-rounded
individuals.
"Students most interested in the University of Michigan
recognize the importance of academic excellence, commit-
ment to service learning and community engagement, interest
in the creative arts and school spirit," Sanders wrote.
Jake Timmis - a senior at Groves High School in Beverly
Hills, Mich. and an applicant this year - said he thinks most
high school students see Wolverines as students of high aca-
demic caliber.
"It's a really respectable school," Timmis said. "Anyone that

goes to Michigan is thought to be a smart kid."
Students want Michigan ... does
Michigan want them?
If the reputation of a Michigan student is so prestigious, does
this world-class university - one that is sometimes referred to as
the "Harvard of the West" - really need to advertise to attract
students?
Timmis said he thinks advertising is unnecessary and that
student recruitment played no role in his decision to apply to the
University. He added that he's never been to a college fair, nor has
he attended an official campus visit.
Considering the already overwhelming demand for the Uni-
versity and increase in applicants after the University switched
to the Common Application last fall, Timmis said he doesn't
believe there's a need for the University to reach out and recruit
students.
However, Jeweler-Bentz said the University does desire stu-
dents, just as students desire the University.
"Michigan wants to attract high-quality students," Jeweler-
Bentz said.
Jeweler-Bentz said the University tries to target specific
groups of students - citing high school visits as an example.
"Michigan knows that they're competing with the top schools
in the country for these amazing applicants," Jeweler-Bentz
said. "Theyneed to make areally good first impression and try to
connect and have that personal relationship."
Admissions officers at the University conduct outreach and
recruitment in-state as well as out-of-state. They do this mainly
through school visits and other types of marketing.
According to Sanders, University admissions officers desire
students who contribute to a "unique campus culture."
"Sharing the experiences of current students regarding their
U-M experience is the best way to help prospective students
understand the Michigan campus community culture," Sanders
wrote.
Sanders added that the University uses multiple mediums -
including e-mails, mailings, phone calls and alumni recruitment
- to reach out to prospective students who match that culture.
The out-of-state Michigan student
Being an in-state student, Timmis was aware of the Univer-
sity before he applied. But out-of-state students have to do alittle
more research to learn aboutthe AnnArbor campus.
Julie Weltman, a senior at Plano Senior High School in Plano,
Texas, said she wouldn't have known much about the Univer-
sity if she didn't have relatives in Michigan. Admissions offi-
cers didn't visit her school, and she never attended a college fair
where University officials were present.
"I already know about Michigan because I have a lot of family
up there," Weltman said. "If I didn't, then I would really have no
idea and probably wouldn't have applied."
Some Michigan residents argue that the University - being a
public university in the state of Michigan - should feel an obliga-
tion to admit more in-state students over students who apply from

coURTESY OF ABC
Confiscating pets from dormitory residents was never explicitly stated in
their job description. The South Quad Residence Hall in 1982 had to deal
with exactly that. As described in The Michigan Daily article, "Sorry, Rover
must stay home," (10/24/1982) RAs had problems with students bringing ani-
mals to live in their close quarters - advisors actually confiscated a rabbit and a
tarantula during the academic school year. Excessive attention and whispers gave
away the secret pals.
One resident successfully got away with a 20-gallon aquarium with two tropical
fish. One of the fish, an 8-inch Oscar, actually ate live goldfish. The anonymous
resident cleverly placed the aquarium in a strategic way as to avoid prying stares
from passerby. Those who want to have a companion - either in their dorm or off-
campus housing - will have little to no luck, as most off-campus landlords forbid
critters. Sorry Rover, you're just not allowed.

University alum Eim Michalik, also a Flagship Program participant, arrived at
Cairo International Airport at about 3 am after g three-hour bus ride traveling
south from Alexandria.
Michalik had just finished her final exams at the UniverityofAlexandria and
was headed home to Husron, Texas to visit her fiaonce Her trip to the airport that
Friday morning,she said was nothing out of the ordinary.
"Everythingwas veycal at that point," Michalik said. "On the trip there
waant anything differenr from any other trip I took to the airport. There weren't
manypeople out because it as the middle of the night. The airportwas notvery
crowded. The onlydifferent was that there was no Internet this time."
- Though H'Mihlk didn't know it at the time, the Internet wasn't working
bease the governmentrhad shut offlnernet acess throughour the countrymian
ill-fated attempt to preventthe protests from coninuing.
The attempt failed, as thousands of protesera again took to rhe streets, but
Miyhalik was unaware of any of this until she landed backin the United States.
"My flight made it out, and I didn't hear anything until I saw my fiancde at the
airport, and he was telling me that there were alot of flights that were cancelled
so everyone was worried about me," she said. "That's when I heard about all the
protests breaking out."
Now at home in Houston, Michalik acknowledges how lucky she was to make
it outofthe tounry, but she said she feels abitguiltyknowingher friends and the
host family she was staying with are still potentially in danger.
Michalik said she's been calling her host family daily to heck on them. They're
sfe, she said, but every night the boys and men patrol the streets to protect the
neighborhood from looters and criminals.
"The first day I called was very traumati- ecause they were telling me that
therewere criminals who were released from prison, andtheyweregoinginto the
houses and stealing from them and killing people," Michalik said. "So, was very
worried about everyone I knew there."
While Michalik had returned to the U.S., Ward and his friends in Alexandria
weresoping with the protsts that had gripped te city. The miliar had been
deployed, butrthe protesters cont'nued to demonstrate.
Ward decided to stay hoe and not participate becuse he was worrled aout
v olence, but he said some of his friends ventured toth western end of the r4r
