Officials say that
$200,000 could be
cut from budget
By ANNIE THOMAS
Daily StaffReporter
University of Michigan Hillel,
the campus organization famed
for its Friday night Shabbat din-
ners and free "Jewish Penicillin"
matzah ball soup deliveries for
the sick, has caught its own case
of the nation's economic blues.
Officials from the organiza-
tion said they might need to cut
as much as $200,000 from their
annual budget. They are now
starting a grassroots fundraising
campaign in hopes of avoiding
staff and salary cuts or poten-
tially ending popular programs
before the end of the fiscal year
on June 30.
Hillel's . Executive Direc-
tor Michael Brooks wrote in an
e-mail that like many non-profit
organizations in the country, the
University's Hillel is experienc-
ing some tough economic times.
BrookssaidtheBernieMadoff's
Ponzi scheme didn't affect Hillel

as much as it affected many other
Jewish non-profit organizations.
But funding is down because par-
ents and alumni have been less
able to contribute because of lost
jobs and tight financial times.
"Last year we had 3,500 annual
donors, but we expect that num-
her to be down this year," Brooks
wrote in an e-mail. "The students
conductingour annual phonathon
campaign this year have spoken
with many of our supporters who
are facing their own financial
challenges and in some cases who
have lost their jobs."
Hillel officials recognize that
part of the problem may be that
the organization spread itself too
thin, Brooks said, by supporting
so many student groups and pro-
viding a variety of services.
"It's also a function of Hillel
havingover the past several years
sodramaticallyextendeditsrange
of services not only to the Jewish
community but to the entire cam-
pus community," Brooks wrote in
the e-mail. "There are now about
50 student groups and organi-
zations formally affiliated with
Hillel and the number increases
each year."

University president
says it's too early to
know if there will be
a tuition increase
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily StaffReporter
At an intimate meeting yester-
day, University President Mary

Sue Coleman told students how the
University will help them cope with
financial hardships over the next
year, but admitted it was too early
to tell whether a tuition increase
was on the horizon.
Coleman met with approximate-
ly 40 students yesterday in her last
fireside chat of the year. Coleman
hosts an invitation only fireside
chat with students each month to
discuss any concerns they have
about the University.

Coleman focused a major part of
the chat on explaining the budget
process and responding to student
concerns about University finances.
Vice President for Student Affairs
Royster Harper also fielded ques-
tions from students.
Coleman said the budget process
begins by examining expenses that
are expected to rise - like energy
and utility costs, unionized employ-
ee salaries and supply costs - and
then reviewing individual schools'

budgets. At the same time, Coleman
said expected revenue levels are
considered to make sure they will
cover the budgeted expenses.,
Coleman said pinpointing rev-
enue levels has been very difficult
this. year because of several vari-
ables that are still up in the air.
"That's been particularly chal-
lenging this year because we don't
know what's going to happen with
the state (appropriations)," she

Sobering news: Beer tax may rise

By ESHWAR

Daily StaffReporter
For commercial producer Mat-
thew Grocoff, living green with
a geothermal system has meant
sustained comfort at a fraction
of the original cost. And, with a
global drive toward sustainabil-
ity, Grocoff believes geothermal
energy may no longer be taking
a backseat in the discussion of
energy alternatives.
Grocoff said he and his wife,
Kelly, moved to Ann Arbor from
Santa Monica, Calif. bringing
with them a Californian con-
sciousness about water and ener-

gy efficiency. Still in the ongoing
process of renovating their home
in the Old West Side of Ann
Arbor, the Grocoffs have retrofit-
ted a 110-year-old Victorian-style
house with the latest eco-friendly
technology.
After insulatingthe house, buy-
ing energy-saving light motion
sensors and installing Energy
Star appliances, the couple set
its sights on a geothermal unit to
heat and cool their new home.
Referring to the Envision - a
geothermal system created by
WaterFurnace - as "green hling,"
Grocoff was eager to share the

Tax would help
fund child abuse
prevention programs
By DEVON THORSBY
Daily StaffReporter
Beer pong tournaments could get
more expensive if a Michigan state
task force gets its way.
The Michigan Child Welfare
Improvement Task Force plans to
recommend a higher tax on beer in
Michigan, raising the tax from two
to five cents per 12 ounces of beer,

or about one can, i"shars,'grocery
stores and wholesale stores. The
money from the tax rate increase
will go toward prevention pro-
grams for child abuse and neglect
and to help children in the foster
care system.
Patrick Babcock, a co-chair
of the task force, said raising the
taxes on beer would have a large
impact on child abuse prevention
programs.
"If the legislature were to adopt
the five-cent proposal, we could
raise as much as $110 million per
year," Babcock said. "And for five
cents on the bottle, we think it's a

small amount to be able to protect
our children."
Babcock added that the group
chose to tax beer because of high
trends of alcoholism among abusive
or neglectful parents.
"There is a relationship between
the ingestion of alcohol and child
abuse and neglect," Babcock said.
"Though it is not always the case,
there is often alcohol involved in
cases of child abuse and neglect."
But University students
shouldn't get too worried yet
because the proposal is likely to
face opposition once it reaches the

The art of temperature

Sometimes the Fishbowl feels like a
sauna, and sometimes the Mason Hall
classrooms feel like freezers. But if
you've ever wondered who controls the
thermostats around Angell Hall, you're
not alone.
The Angell Hall thermostats can be
adjusted by almost anyone who is using
the building's facilities, although it is not
recommended to fiddle around with the
thermostats, according to Jim Almashy,
an energy engineer in the College of Lit-
erature, Science and the Arts.
"Thermostats in offices andclassrooms
do not respond in the same way they do at
home," Almashy wrote in an e-mail inter-
view. "It may take an hour to change the
temperature two degrees in a large class-
room".
He added that LSA controls the spe-
cific temperatures at which its buildings
should be kept.
"Ideally, LSA wouldlike all thermostats
to be set at 74 degrees in the summer and

68 degrees in the winter," Almashy wrote.
"As the LSA EnergyfEngineer, I try to visit
all classrooms, offices, and common areas
twice a year makingthis adjustment."
Almashy said this temperature range
is consistent with practices at other uni-
versities and complies with the Univer-
sity's Planet Blue Program, which was
launched in Fall 2008 and is designed to
increase energy efficiency.
"When that program is complete, LSA
might consider mandatingthe above tem-
perature settings," Almashy wrote.
Though temperatures' generally stay
within a certain range, Almashy added
that common areas are usually kept cool-
er than the rest ofthe building inthe win-
ter and warmer in the summer.
To regulate the change inbuildingtem-
peratures, Almashy said part of his job is
to "review classroom schedules, as well
as office schedules, and turn off heating,
ventilating, air conditioning, and exhaust
systems when buildings are unoccupied."

The reason students sometimes feel
like the rooms in Angell Hall, especially
the Fishbowl, are too warm is due to
the unusual warm days in the middle of
spring or fall, accordingto Almashy.
"The Plant (Operations) cannot just
turn large air conditioning systems on
and off for a day," he wrote. "It typically
takes a team of skilled trade Plant employ-
ees weeks to fill the chilled water air con-
ditioning systems and ready them for
operation during the spring, and equally
as longto drain them in the fall."
Almashy said states' varied weather
and temperature patterns make this espe-
cially difficult.
"Turning these systems on too soon
in the spring or running them too long
in the fall could result in catastrophic
failures if temperatures drop below
freezing for any length of time," he JDMOCH/Daiy
wrote. "And that's a real possibility in Oneof many thermostats in Angell Hall The
Michigan." thermostats are controlled by the LSA energy
- DIYA WADHWA engineer.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Detroit man sues to
block demolition of
rail depot
A Detroit man wants to derail
the possible demolition of the
Michigan Central Station.
Stanley Christmas filed suit
Monday against the city and City
Council, contending the 96-year-
old building is protected by the
National Historic Preservation Act
of 1966.
The council on April 7 approved
a resolution seeking emergency
demolition of the decrepit 17-story
building long considered a symbol
of Detroit's decay. Mayor Ken Cock-
rel Jr. wants to use $3.64 million in
federal stimulus funds to raze the
station, which closed in 1988.
City attorneys will outline the
process to the council on April 28.
Mayoral spokesman Daniel Cher-
rin says the city has made no firm
plans regarding the depot's fate.
Christmas ran for mayor in 2005
and in the Feb. 24 special mayoral
election, drawing 103 votes.
HILLSDALE, Mich.
Hillsdale's youngest
mayor won't seek
re-election
The city's youngest mayor is
ready to move on.
Michael Sessions was 18 when
he won a 2005 write-in campaign
in Hillsdale, a city of 8,200 located
85 miles southwest of Detroit.
The 21-year-old announced yes-
terday he won't seek re-election be-
cause he is to graduate from Hills-
dale College in 2010 and his career
plans may prevent him from com-
pleting a second four-year term.
Sessions registered to vote one
day after his 18th birthday in Sep-
tember 2005 and signed up as a
write-in candidate the day after
that. He financed his campaign
with $700 earned by working at a
french fry wagon at local fairs and
carnivals.
After defeating the incumbent
by two votes, Sessions appeared
on national news programs and on
the "Late Show with David Letter-
man."

Somali pirates on
hijack spree since

A Somali pirates were back to
business as usual yesterday, defi-
antly seizing four more ships with
60 hostages after U.S. sharpshoot-
ers rescued an American freighter
captain. "No one can deter us," one
bandit boasted.
The freed skipper, Richard Phil-
lips, will return home to the United
States today, after reuniting with
his 19-man crew in the Kenyan port
of Mombasa, according to the ship-
ping company Maersk Line Ltd.

and hostages to show they would
not be intimidated by President
Barack Obama's pledge to confront

the high-seas bandits, according to
a pirate based in the Somali coastal
town of Harardhere.
"Our latest hijackings are meant
to show that no one can deter us
from protecting our waters from
the enemy because we believe in
dying for our land," Omar Dahir
Idle told The Associated Press by
telephone. "Our guns do not fire
water. I am sure we will avenge."
MONTPERLIER, Vermont
Vt. may set aside
harshest penalties
for 'sexting'
Parents, school districts and
law enforcement have been grap-
pling with what to do with teen-
agers who take sexually explicit
photos of themselves with their
cell phone cameras and send them
to friends.
Vermont legislators are moving
to get rid of one option: child por-
nography counts that result in life-
time listings on the state's Internet
sex offender registry.
Legislation passed by the Ver-
mont Senate and pending in the
House would remove the most seri-
ous legal consequences for teenag-
ers who engage in "sexting." The
bill would carve out an exemption
from prosecution for child por-
nography for 13- to 18-year-olds
on either the sending or receiving
end of sexting messages, so long as
the sender voluntarily transmits an
image of himself or herself.

N. Korea set to
restart nuclear
programs

Officials oust U.N.
inspectors, pull
out of negotiations
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -
North Korea said yesterday it was
restarting its rogue nuclear pro-
gram, bootingU.N. inspectors and
pulling out of disarmament talks
in an angry reaction to U.N. Secu-
rity Council condemnation of its
April 5 rocket launch.
Pyongyang ordered U.N. nucle-
ar inspectors to remove seals
and cameras from its Yongbyon
nuclear site and leave the country
as quickly as possible, the Inter-
national Atomic Energy Agency
said.
North Korea told the IAEA
it was "immediately ceasing all
cooperation" and "has decided
to reactivate all facilities and go
ahead with the reprocessing of
spent fuel," according to a state-
ment from the U.N. agency.
White House spokesman Rob-
ert Gibbs condemned the decision,
saying the international commu-
nity will not accept North Korea
until it abandons what Washing-
ton calls its pursuit of nuclear
weapons. The North must "cease
its provocative threats," he said.
Russia also deplored the move
and urged its neighbor to rejoin
six-nation talks, which have been
held since 2003 in an attempt
to get Pyongyang to give up its
nuclear program in exchange for
aid and other concessions. Brit-
ain's Foreign Office said the break
with the IAEA was "completely
unjustified."
China - Pyongyang's main ally
and the host of the talks - called
for calm on all sides.
Despite its defiance, ana-

lysts say North Korea, one of the
poorest countries in the world,
is unlikely to abandon the talks
altogether. They suggested North
Korea could be trying to draw the
United States into direct negotia-
tions, which it has long sought.
Hajime Izumi, a North Korea
expert at the University of Shizuo-
ka in Japan, said the North Kore-
an reaction was designed to "bring
the United States to the negotiat-
ing table and squeeze maximum
concessions from it."
All 15 members of the Security
Council, including China and Rus-
sia, agreed Monday to condemn
the April 5 launch as a violation
of U.N. resolutions and to tighten
sanctions against the regime. The
U.N. statement was weaker than
the resolution Japan and the Unit-
ed States had pursued.
North Korea claims it launched
a communications satellite as
part of a peaceful bid to develop
its space program as Kim Jong
I embarked on his third term as
leader. The U.S. and others call the
launch an illicit test of the tech-
nology used to fire an interconti-
nental ballistic missile, even one
eventually destined for the U.S.
A Security Council resolution
passed in 2006, days after North
Korea carried out an under-
ground nuclear test, prohibits
Pyongyang from engaging in any
ballistic missile-related activity
- including launching rockets
that use the same delivery tech-
nology as missiles mounted with
warheads, Washington and other
nations say.
Under a 2007 six-party deal,
North Korea agreed to disable its
main nuclear complex in Yong-
byon north of Pyongyang in
return for1 million tons of fuel oil
and other concessions.

In this May 14, 2008 file photo, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich testifies in front of the Senate on Capitol Hill
Gingrich considers run
for White House in2012

Former Speaker of
the House's media
blitz raises suspicions
about potential run
ATHENS, Ga. (AP) - More than
a decade after he stepped down
as speaker of the House into what
seemed like almost certain politi-
cal oblivion, Newt Gingrich is back
and seemingly more relevant than
ever.
Gingrich seems to be every-
where these days, headlining an
endless circuit of GOP dinners,
popping up on TV news shows,
authoring yet another best-selling
book and acting as a policy guru to
out-of-powercongressionalRepub-
licans on how to do battle with the
Democratic White House.
As beleaguered Republicans
look for a standard bearer after last
year's disastrous election, they've
been tossing around the names of
flashy new stars like Alaska Gov.
Sarah Palin, the 2008 vice presi-

dential candidate, and Louisiana
Gov. Bobby Jindal, young and
Indian American in a party that's
increasingly identified with older
white men.
But could the GOP's savior
instead be a wonkish, twice-
divorced throwback to the
fiercely partisan Republican rev-
olution?
Gingrich has managed to keep
himself in the public eye since
leaving the House, but the blitz
of public appearances in recent
months is reminiscent of the run-
up to 2007, when he toyed with a
presidential run only to abandon it
before the primaries began. Now,
some are speculating that the for-
mer congressman from Georgia is
laying the groundwork for a White
House bid in 2012.
Grover Norquist, a prominent
conservative and president of
Americans for Tax Reform, said
Gingrich is on nearly every Repub-
lican short list of possible White
House prospects.
"One of the ways you judge these
guys is how hard they're working,

and Newt is out there hustling,"
Norquist said.
Gingrich does not exactly dis-
courage such presidential specu-
lation. Instead he argues he is
busy with work for a pair of think
tanks - American Solutions and
the Center for Health Transforma-
tion - that give him a platform to
speak on a dizzying array of issues:
from childhood obesity and nucle-
ar weapons i North Korea to off-
shore oil exploration.
"I really love trying to solve
problems. I get very excited about
it," Gingrich, 65, said after teach-
ing a law school class recently at
the University of Georgia.
With Gingrich, a former college
history professor, the ideas some-
times come so fast and furious that
even supporters say they can feel
overwhelned by a conversation
with him.
Rich Galen, a Washington-
based Republican strategist and
former Gingrich aide, called him
the GOP's "intellect-in-chief."
"He's always been the idea man,"
Galen said.

Ex-Il. governor
pleads not guilty

Blagojevich denies
charges of fraud
and racketeering
CHICAGO (AP) - Ousted Gov.
Rod Blagojevich pleaded not guilty
to racketeering and fraud charges
yesterday, defiantly embarking on
a long journey to clear his name but
facing serious money problems and
without ateam of lawyers in place.
"I'm glad this process has finally
begun," the impeached former gov-
ernor told the media throng that
spilled into the street in front of the
courthouse afterhe andhisbrother,
Robert, were arraigned on corrup-
tion charges.
"It's the end of the beginning
in one respect but it's the begin-
ning of another aspect" of the
case, Blagojevich said. "That is
the beginning of me being able
to prove and clear my name and
be vindicated of what are inaccu-
rate allegations."
Blagojevich, 52, is charged
with scheming to sell Presi-
dent Barack Obama's former
U.S. Senate seat, attempting
to extort campaign money
from companies seeking state
business and plotting to use
the financial muscle of the
governor's office to pressure
the Chicago Tribune to fire
editorial writers calling for
his impeachment. The accu-
sations led to his ouster as
governor, but he repeated
yesterday what he has been
saying for months - that he is
not guilty.
The former governor
appeared to be in his element
as the focus of a major political
story yet again. He chatted ami-
ably with reporters, and when
one television cameraman stood
atop a concrete pillar outside the
courthouse to get a shot from
above, he obligingly looked up
and smiled.
Blagojevich was arrested
Dec. 9 after authorities said
he was heard on FBI wire-
taps discussing swapping the
Obama seat for a Cabinet post,
a new job or campaign money.
A federal grand jury returned
a 19-count indictment April 2
that alleges corruption begin-
ning before Blagojevich even
took office.
At the 10-minute arraign-
ment, Blagojevich and the only
attorney currently on his case,
longtimefriendSheldonSorosky,
entered a plea of not guilty.

U.S. District Judge James B.
Zagel then started a sequence of
legal maneuvers that attorneys
said would most likely lead to a
Blagojevichtrial ayear ortwo down
the road. Blagojevich faces charges
including racketeering conspiracy,
wire fraud, extortion conspiracy,
attempted extortion and making
false statements. Most of the charg-
es carry a maximum sentence of 20
years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
Prosecutors must give the
defense team mounds of documents
and recordings made over years of
investigation. Defense attorneys
can then be expected to ask Zagel to
throwoutmuch of it.
"The circumstances of these
wiretaps hasn't been flushed out
yet," said DePaul University law
professor Leonard Cavise. "We
can expect all kinds of motions to
suppress evidence. They will chal-
lenge the warrants. They will chal-
lenge whether the government had
probable cause" to tap Blagojevich's
home and campaign office phones.

Chrysler debtholder talks
pick up pace; M stalled

Banks and creditors
hold $6.9 billion in
secured debt
from Chrysler
DETROIT (AP) - The pace of
negotiations between Chrysler
LLC and its debtholders picked
up this week, but talks at General
Motors Corp. have slowed as both
companies face looming govern-
ment deadlines to cut their debt
in order to stay out of bankrupt-
cy.
Banks and other Chrysler
creditors that hold $6.9 billion
in secured debt are preparing a
counteroffer after they rejected
a proposal from the automaker
and the government to erase the
loans for $1 billion, according to

a person briefed on the negotia-
tions.
At GM, a group representing
bondholders is still waiting for a
counteroffer from the company,
according to another person with
knowledge of the talks.
Both people spoke on condition
of anonymity because the negotia-
tions are private.
The Treasury Department
is getting involved in the nego-
tiations with GM and Chrysler's
debtholders after the companies
failed to finalize their restruc-
turing plans by the government's
original March 31 deadline.
President Barack Obama gave
the automakers more time, but
with instructions to make even
tougher cuts.

Last week, the Treasury
Department was pressing GM
to offer bondholders a small
amount of its stock in exchange
for their $28 billion of GM debt,
according to published reports.
That would be much less gener-
ous than a similar offer GM made
two weeks ago.
There'smore urgency atChrysler
because the Auburn Hills-based
company is a little more than two
weeks away from its new April 30
deadline to get concessions from
its creditors and unions and ink a
deal with Italian automaker Fiat
Group SpA. If the Fiat alliance isn't
finalized by then, the government
has threatened not to provide any
more aid and let Chrysler be sold
off in pieces.

MSA must make funding decisions more transparent
Jn the most recent Michigan Student Assembly elections,
the student body narrowly elected the Michigan Vision
Party presidential candidates to run the assembly. Or at
least that's what roughly 13 percent of students who actually
voted did. But despite low turnout, MSA still has a responsibil-
ity to the entire student body and the Michigan Vision party
needs to act quickly to implement some long-overdue changes.
With a new party in charge, it's finally time for MSA to fix its
transparency issues. The assembly should start by making sure
that the rationale behind how funding is allocated to student
groups is better understood - and such information should be
readily available to students on MSA's website.

Life, death and lists

MSA managed to give out more money
to student groups this year than in pre-
vious years. In difficult economic times
- when financial backers may be willing
to spend less on student groups - MSA's
role in allocating funds to these groups is
more important than ever. And the pro-
cess to apply for funding from MSA was
made easier in response to complaints that
the previous system was too complicated.
Initiated at the beginning of last semester,
the new procedure for requesting funding
from MSA's Budget Priorities and Commu-
nity Service Committees requires students
to fill out only one form.
Though the process for receiving fund-
ing is simpler, the reasons for why some
funding decisions are made can still be
mysterious. This can be an issue for newer
groups who may not have the institutional
knowledge that comes with applying for
funding several times. To assure that stu-
dent groups aren't surprised and confused
by funding decisions, MSA needs to make
sure an explanation of the decision-making
process is readily available to all students.
With a better understanding of this, stu-
dents won't have to wonder how funding
decisions are made.
Being clearer about funding decisions
is one way that MSA can start solving its

transparency issues. But the assembly
has struggled for years to keep students
informed about what it's doing, and there
are plenty of other things the assembly
needs to fix. While the new administration
has displayed a willingness to combat this
problem, more can be done.
A glaring example is the recent disclo-
sure of MSA's attendance record. On aver-
age, 30 percent of MSA representatives
were absent at each meeting last semes-
ter. This number of absences certainly
impacted the assembly's ability to govern
effectively and students should have been
aware before heading to the polls. For the
sake of accountability, students need to
know which of their representatives are
showing up to meetings.
A good place to list such information
would be MSA's website. The website
should ideally be MSA's best method of
informing students about its decisions
Sadly, it has been neglected by the assem-
bly for years. The Michigan Vision Party
must make good on its campaign promise
to present students with a better one so
that students can effectively check up on
their representatives.
While progress is being made on issues
like simplifying the funding process, MSA
still has a long road ahead of it.

T here comes a time in people's
lives when they reflect on
lost opportunities, forgotten
childhood dreams and what truly
makes them happy.
Most die before
this happens.
As the school
year dwindles=
down, however,
existential crises
are on the rise.
Life choices are
being called intoW
question. Intended WILL
majors are fall- GRUNDLER
ing under intense
scrutiny. All over
campus, students
are asking themselves if they actu-
ally want to graduate with a degree in
Choral Music Education.
Youmightfeel alittle overwhelmed.
Maybe you don't even have a major
in mind. Maybe that "Undecided"
T-shirt you bought as a joke to make
your parents laugh is still in your
closet, only now they're not laughing
anymore. But your friends are. Only
they're not your friends - they're
weird voices inside your head.
I might be of help. The answer -
like most answers - lies in list mak-
ing. List making is a process that
condenses incredibly complex issues
into simple, manageable steps. The
entire American way of life - the
Declaration of Independence, weight
loss, etc. - relies on making lists with
specific resolutions in mind.
If you're worried about choos-
ing the wrong career and leading an
existence of utter- boredom, it might
be beneficial to make a "life list" of
all the amazing goals you would like
to accomplish before you die and are

forgotten about forever. A good plan
is to start with modest goals and then
increase in complexity, assuming
future technology improves.
Here is a brief example of one of my
lists to get your ideas going:
1. Buy more toothpaste (with fluo-
ride).
2. Box out weird guy with beard
during next pick-up game. He is short
but quick.
3. Grow beard.
4. Start to read the news and hold
opinions.
S. Join the Squirrel Club.
It's always a good idea to have your
first few goals be relatively frivolous
and/or unambitious. Thus, if you
don't accomplish them you'll know
you're not really cut out for this sort
of thing. Subsequent goals should
start to become more difficult.
6. Pass Calculus II at a community
college.
7. Run for president of the Squirrel
Club.
8. Print lots of little colored pieces
of paper with nothing on them and
pass them out on the Diag. See if any-
one notices the difference.
9. Abolish something.
10. Teach my friend from Ohio how
to operate indoor plumbing.*
*I recommend placing a star by any
goal that you feel is especially chal-
lenging. After ten or so goals, you
have to start predicting what your
life will be like in the future so you
can continue to be spontaneous. Odds
are after ten goals and about ten years
you'll be stuck in a boring job, so mix
it up a little. To continue...
11. Sell the house, car and kids and
get a boat! Sail the world.
12. Do not sail the world near
Somalia.

13. Better just get a personalized
license plate instead.
14. Start drinking wine. Learn how
to swish it around and smell it with-
out looking silly.
15. Run for the president of my
kids' school board, then dismantle
it because school boards are plain
annoying.
There's always the
Squirrel Club. You
could be president.
At this point in your life list, any-
where from fifteento thirtyyears may
have passed. Amazing, I know! Under
no circumstances are you required to
continue - you may find that fifteen to
twenty goals is enough. However, by
the period 2025 to 2040, impressive
technology may emerge. Feel free to
get creative. Here are my ideas:
16. Own some sort of futuristic
device that includes a phone, camera,
e-mail, calculator and girlfriend.
17. Clone it.
18. Contact extraterrestrial civili-
zations to see if they have any extra
oil to spare.
My list goes on, but the general
idea should be apparent by now. It's
important to remind yourself of what
matters - to think critically about
your goals before it's too late, even
if you are majoring in Ceramics. So
make your list. And good luck.

$22,729.00. This should be a number familiar to stu-
dents across campus as we roll steadily through the sec-
ond semester. This particular number is the 2008-2009
estimated cost of tuition for in-state first and second year
students at the University. It's a dauntingly high number
for those struggling to pay for both credit hours and a
roof over their heads. Unfortunately, it's not an uncom-
mon circumstance as colleges and universities across
the country continue to raise the numbers on their price
tags.
As anyone who needs to keep textbook costs and
electricity bills on their mental list would know, a col-
lege degree in today's world is becoming an increasingly
difficult undertaking for the average middle-class stu-
dent. Many students need to worry about issues other
than classes. I know that I am among the lucky students
attending the University with a relatively stable financial
situation at home, but regrettably, this isn't true for far
too many other prospective and current college students.
The prospect of earning a University degree is even more
disheartening if feels out of reach at an early age.
Rewind to your middle school days. If you were any-
thing like me (and probably plenty of others who won't
admit it), you were thinking about prospective colleges
five or six years ahead of time. In retrospect, what felt
like an extra load of stress to place on my 13-year-old
shoulders now seems more like a luxury. I had assumed
that college was in my future. It was an unquestioned
undercurrent that affected every aspect of my academic
life. Now, years later, I realize that this is far from the
experience that many kids had growing up.
Without the assurance of further education waiting

in the future, it's easy for young minds to lose focus on
school even if there may have been initial enthusiasm. At
the University, a branch of the organization InnoWorks,
of which I am a member, is one group on campus dedicat-
ed to sparking an interest for the sciences in financially
disadvantaged middle school students.
According to Anudeep Mukkamala, Executive Direc-
tor of the University's InnoWorks chapter, InnoWorks
strives to increase middle school students' interest in
attending college by making the opportunities provided
by the University more accessible. InnoWorks tries to
connect middle school students with University experi-
ences by organizing visits to facilities like the Medical
School and meetings with University faculty. The goal is
to prompt middle school students to consider careers in
math, science and engineering.
InnoWorks's immediate goal is to start current middle
school students down the path of scientific discovery,
connecting them with opportunities available only at a
major research university like the University of Michigan.
In the long run, InnoWorks will become more involved
in the process of making higher education a reality,
especially for socioeconomically disadvantaged stu-
dents.
We've all jumped through the hoops and hurdles to
get here, with or without help. As obtaining an education
from a college or university increasingly becomes a lux-
ury of the upper class, keep an eye out for InnoWorks as
this summer approaches, and with it, the organization's
second annual science camp.

'U' researchers, local business
owners tout geothermal energy

From Page 1A
ment. To first cover the upfront cost
of the system, the Grocoffs took out
a rehabilitation loan to be paid back
over the 30-year life of the geother-
mal system, adding $40 to their
monthly mortgage payment.
"The payback was immediate,"
he said. "As soon as the geothermal
started running in March (of2006),
it cut our utility bill by 200 bucks."
What may be more remarkable,
however, is that the Grocoffs paid
$350 for heating, cooling and hot
water for the month of January
prior to installing the system. After
the geothermal system became
operational, the Grocoffs spent
around $550 in total for 2007 - a
monthly average of about $45.
With the savings in mind, Gro-
coff said everyone looking to pur-
chase a new furnace in the next
five years should instead invest in
a geothermal system. Grocoff cited
the 30 percent tax credit incen-
tive guaranteed for implementing
a geothermal system as outlined
in the energy rebate section of the
recent stimulus plan as one major
reason to install one.
In its simplest sense, geothermal
energy relies on extracting heat
from the Earth's interior to gen-
erate power. Current geothermal
systems come in two types.
In one form, deep boreholes are
drilled into the ground and fluids
are run through a system for direct
exchange of heat. Generators
that use this form often rely upon
hydrothermal resources like hot
springs to produce electricity.
The second type of geother-
mal systems, like the one in Gro-
coff's home, take advantage of
the Earth's static temperatures at
shallow depths of 20 feet or more
where seasonal variation is not
felt. At about 50 degrees Fahren-
heit year-round, the ground is an
effective heat sink in the summer
and a heat source in the winter.
Consideringhis original motiva-
tions to pursue green renovations,
Grocoff echoed the sentiments of
environmental pundits, saying that
current levels of energy consump-
tion are unsustainable.
"It has become obvious with
automobiles, and it's soon becoming
obvious with our homes," he said.
Henry Pollack, professor emeri-
tus of geological sciences, said the
new appeal for geothermal systems
has come from the rising price of
carbon-based fuels. The initial
installation cost of the system is
paid back over a number of years,
and the savings have always been
relative to the cost of natural gas.
"When carbon-based fuels

MSA

uniting to urge the U.S. Senate to
pass the Development, Relief and
Education for Alien Minors Act to
help undocumented young people,
who arrived to the United States
as children, become citizens by
either completing two years of
military service or attend college
for two years. The bill would also
allow universities to offer these
students in-state tuition at state
schools and make them eligible
for financial aid. Currently, it is
unclear if state universities can
offer in-state tuition to undocu-
mented immigrants.
At itsweekly meeting last night,
the Michigan 'Student Assembly
passed a resolution supporting a
federal DREAM Act in a vote of
17-5-10. It was authored by Rack-
ham Rep. Kate Stenvig and LSA
Rep. Robby Saldafia.
The resolution includes sup-
porting a march for the act that
will be held on May S in southwest
Detroit. The march will begin in
Patton Memorial Park at 10 a.m.
and end at Clark Park with a rally
at noon. Organizations contribut-
ing to the march and rally include,
Migrant and Immigrant Rights
Awareness, By Any Means Neces-
sary and Latinos Unidos/United
de Michigan.
"Many of these (undocumented
immigrants) have attended ,U.S.
schools for most of their lives,
but their immigration status bars
them from opportunities that
make a college education afford-
able, including in-state tuition
rates, loans and grants, most pri-
vate scholarships and the abil-
ity to work legally," the resolution
reads.
The resolution states that MSA
will send a copy of the resolu-
tion to President Barack Obama,
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelo-
si, The Michigan Daily, The Ann
Arbor News and the Detroit Free
Press.
Several supporters of the
DREAM Act addressed the
assembly about the issue at both
last night's and last week's meet-
ings, encouraging representatives
to vote in favor of the resolution.
Laura Sanders, a lecturer in
the School of Social Work and
founder of an interfaith coalition
for immigrant rights, stressed the
importance of the cause at MSA's
meeting last week.
"The whole issue of immigra-
tion is really at the forefront of
our human rights and civil rights
movements right now," she said.
"We don'treally realize how under
attack our immigrant community
is, and you can really change that.
You can really have a voice as
Michigan students."
The proposal was originally
brought before the assembly last
week but was tabled until this
week because the meeting ran too

Wednesday, April 15, 2009 - 7A
long.
The DREAM Act applies to
students with "good moral char-
acter" who arrived in the United
States before turning 16, lived in
the country for at least five years
and graduated from high school
or earned a General Education
Development diploma. After high
school graduation, individuals are
required to serve in the military
or attend college for at least two
years, according to the Library of
Congress website.
LSA senior Christine Rhee,
president of Migrant and Immi-
grant Rights Awareness (MIRA),
said the DREAM Act would help
to provide financial relief for
undocumented immigrants.
"So far a lot of undocumented
students are just stalling or are
deferring their acceptance let-
ters or aren't even considering
going to higher universities just
because of the fact that they have
undocumented status and the fact
that they can't pay for out-of-state
tuition, granted their whole lives
were practically in the states that
they wanted to apply to," she said.
Mohammed said if the DREAM
Act were to pass, it would help him
finish college and earn a degree in
social work.
"The one personal thing is that
it would enable me to go to school
and finish my degree, my master's
and bachelor's, and then actually
be able to give back to the commu-
nity that I've pretty much grown
up in my whole life," he said.
Mohammed said he believes in
students' potential to make a dif-
ference in the passage of the leg-
islation.
"One big role is just as a sign of
unity. Everybody coming together
and voicing support for it is one
big definite step," he said. "And
another one would be going and
actually lobbying on behalf of it
as students and as people from the
community."
Stenvig echoed this sentiment,
saying that universities play a
critical role in passing this legis-
lation.
"In particular, universities can
play a big role because students
are coming to administrations,
who can say, 'We need to do this
to make it possible for (undocu-
mented) students to be able to
come here,'"she said. "And I think
that's really important."
Even though several repre-
sentatives who spoke against the
resolution said they favored the
overall concept of the DREAM
Act, there was opposition due to
the unstable nature of the bill.
Rackham Rep. Michael Benson,
who did not vote in favor of the
resolution, said he would encour-
age the assembly to follow the bill
as it might change and to read-
dress the act in the fall.
"My main objection was the
fact that we just approved some-
thing that we don't know what the
final form will be," Benson said.

were cheaper, the payout [for geo-.
thermal] was eight, 10 or even 12
years," he said. "Now, with the
payoff in seven or fewer years,
geothermal has become an attrac-
tive alternative."
Pollack has spent most of his
research career measuring sub-
surface temperatures across the
globe in an effort to map heat loss
from its interior.
He said the expense of drilling
boreholes and the scarcity of loca-
tions with "hot rocks" puts deep
mining for heat far behind wind
power as an established source of
energy. And despite the low effi-
ciency of solar panels, Pollack said
the Earth's interior only generates
four-thousandths of the sun's heat.
"I just don't think we'll see the
mining of the heat as a large-scale
replacement for other sources of
energy," he said.
While deep mining for heat may
not be viable in the near future,
shallow heat exchangers have
already made their way into more
than 15,000 Michigan homes,
according to the Michigan Geo-
thermal Energy Association.
Pollack's only concern with the
personal geothermal system is that
a large amount of fluid exchange is

Both Gov. Jennifer Granholm
and many Republican senators
are opposed to raising taxes after
recently increasing the state
income tax, according to The
Associated Press.
Matt Marsden, spokesman for
Republican Senate Majority Lead-
er Mike Bishop, said that after the
recent income tax raise, any pro-
posal to raise sales taxes the Sen-
ate would likely reject.
"We've made it clear, and the
governor made it clear back in
February, that revenue through
fees and taxes is not something
we are willing to support," Mars-
den said.
Marsden said that while he
thinks it is a hearty attempt at
raising funds for their cause, tax-
ing various goods will not solve
the state's economic issues.
"We have a $1 billion debt and a
nickel of beer is not going to cover

the organization's base of donors

larger sums to the Hillel. Students
are also being asked to reach out
to family and friends who have
University connections and set-

the organization.
Neal Ashinsky, chair of Hillel's

Though it's possible Hillel may

"It's thus been all the more

Mike Lashbrook, president
of the Michigan Wine and Beer

state taxes on beer are already rel-
atively high. He said an increase
would not only hurt the beer
industry in Michigan, but also
consumers.
"The current tax on beer is
already significantly higher than
neighboring states," he said.
Lashbrook said he believed the
proposed tax increase is simply
an attempt to find financial sup-
port the state government will not
provide, though the ramifications
of such a tax could reach everyone
in Michigan.
"Right now the tax increase is
just a suggestion from a private
task force to find funding," he
said. "But an increase that more

said. "That's a moving target right

When Coleman opened the floor
for questions, students asked her
whether she expected a tuition
increase next year and how much
the increase could be. Coleman
told students it was too early to
know whether an increase would
be necessary, but said she would
know what the tuition rates would
be in June, when the budget is sub-
mitted to the University Board of
Regents.
Several students asked Coleman
what the University was planning
to do to help students deal with the
burden of rising tuition levels that
have made it difficult for some stu-
dents to afford tuition.
Coleman didn't offer specifics on
any new programs at the Univer-
sity, but told students that several
federal initiatives will help make
tuition more affordable next year.
Coleman said the American
Opportunity Tax Credit, which
will offer a $2,500 higher educa-
tion tax credit to individuals nak-
ing less than $80,000 a year or
couples making less than $160,000
a year, will help to make tuition
more affordable.
Additionally, Coleman said
increases to work study programs
will create 440 new job opportu-
nities for University students and
give an additional $1.6 million to
students over the next two years.
Finally, Coleman said the $619
increase to individual Pell Grants
would benefit as many as 3,300
students on campus. The increase
will make the average Pell Grant
award $5,050 for the year.
Several students also asked
Coleman what the University is
doing to cut costs or increase rev-
enue streams so that tuition rates
don't need to be increased.
Coleman responded that every
year the deans of each school
submit budget plans that would
eliminate 1 percent, 3 percent and

in our climate and especially dif-
ficult in retrofitting situations, but
we keep trying to push toward that
goal."
An attendee of annual green
building conferences, Grocoff, the
homeowner with the geothermal
unit, admitted it is difficult to find
resources to make decisions about
insulation, heating, cooling, light-
ing and water conservation.
"Even with all of the talk of
green, there's not a really good
resource where homeowners can
go to and learn how to do this," he
said.
To address the issue, Grocoff
has started an Internet TV channel
project called GreenovatinnTV.com.
Set to launch on Earth Dav next
week, the website will offer free
on-demand access to videos about
green building and renovation with
support from social networking
sites like Facebook and Twitter.
Grocoff said he hopes Greenova-
tionTV will serve as "a space where
homeowners can come together
and share ideas." And given his
recent success with implement-
ing a personal geothermal unit, he
anticipates the site will attract an
audience looking to both live green
and save money.

University President Mary Sue Coleman discusses financial issues with students during her fireside chat yesterday.

5 percent of their budget. Based on
the plans, administrators can then
determine how much to cut from
each budget.
"My own office, I've got to cut
1 percent out of my budget this
year," Coleman said. "I don't know
yet how I'm going to do it, but I'm
going to do it because we have to."
One student raised concerns
that with that process, deans may
have an incentive to pad their
budgets with extra money, so
that their cuts aren't as fully real-
ized. Harper told the student that
because of the process in place
and the level of detail required in
budget proposals, that wouldn't
be possible.
A different student recom-
mended to Coleman that she and

other University executives take
pay cuts to help cut expenses at
the University. Coleman didn't say
she was planning to take a cut, but
avoided the question by saying she
couldn't speak for other Univer-
sity executives. Though she has
donated pay increases back to Uni-
versity causes, Coleman accepted
the salary boost she was awarded
by the regents in September. At
about $760,000 in total compen-
sation, Coleman currently ranks
fifth among the highest-paid pub-
lic university presidents, according
to The Chronicle of Higher Educa-
tion.
She continued byexplainingthat
competitive salaries are required
to attract quality employees, both
for administrators and faculty

members.
Students raised other concerns,
including the amount of money
spent on faculty retention incen-
tives and the lack of transparency
in the University budget. Students
also gave Coleman recommenda-
tions, which ranged from more
socially responsible investment
practices to higher payouts from
the endowment.
Before the meeting ended, Cole-
man told students a new web-
site will launch Monday that will
include information about the Uni-
versity's budget, in an effort to bet-
ter inform students and members
of the University community about
what the University is doing to pre-
vent additional financial burdens
on students and their families.

ig Goku, Bulma, Piccolo and Much of the appeal ofthe cartoon
in live-action form. What it was the intricate storyline coupled

with the unique personalities each
character brought to the manga.
The movie should have focused on
just a few important characters and
taken the time to really flesh them
out. That could have eliminated
many of the half-assed introduc-
tory scenes, thereby siphoning the
extra time into a deeper, more lin-
ear storyline.
But the movie's biggest letdowns
are its action sequences. Fans of the
series know the frequent encoun-
ters in the TV show between the
forces of good and evil were epic
and surprising. Contrastingly, the
film contains few battles, and the
battles it does have repeat them-
selves. They all involve the same
moves and CGI effects, neither of
which look polished. The only thing
missing as the characters fly across
the screen is the wire suspending
them in the air. The heavy green-
screen usage is extremely apparent
(like a certain instance when Goku
hops across a very "real" lava flow),

leaving many scenes looking doc-
tored and amateur.
Because there are only a hand-
ful of real fighting scenes, much of
"Dragonball" is boring filler. Each
new line of uninspired and unnec-
essary dialogue makes the hour-
and-a-half long flick feel much
longer than it rightfully should. The
only slightly redeeming qualities of
the movie are the striking Emmy
Rossum ("The Day After Tomor-
row") and relative newcomer Jamie
Chung. Given the rest of the movie's
shortcomings, it's not surprising
that it uses the age-old technique
of hiring charming starlets to com-
pensate for its lack of substance.
"Dragonball" will probably
appeal to very few people - the
fanboys, children under the age
of 11 and most likely some randy,
single men over 40. Future anime-
based movies should learn from the
atrocity that is this film, and hope-
fully evolve into something worth
watching.

Rashida Jones, was featured
prominently in the third season
of "The Office."
So for television critics and
average Joe television junk-
ies alike, "Parks" presents an
intriguing question: Can a show
that borrows so much establish its
own identity? The answer to this
question can't be communicated
in black-and-white absolutes.
While "Parks" unquestionably
sports the feel of "The Office,"
the new faces - save Jones - help
remind us what we're watch-
ing. And at the forefront is dis-
tinguished "SNL" alum Amy
Poehler. As the main attraction,
Poehler convincingly portrays the
wonderfully oblivious optimist
Leslie Knope, a low-level govern-
ment official working at a Parks
and Recreation Department inthe
cradle of Midwestern boredom:
Pawnee, Ind.
Yes, "Parks" mostly takes place
in an office, but this office is set
up differently from the Scranton
branch of Dunder Mifflin - and
that's not a reference to the fur-
niture, but the web of palpable
personal relationships that per-
vade it. The bread and butter of
"The Office" is the clashing of
signature personalities, whether
it's between Dwight and Andy
over the love of cat-aficionado
Angela, or Michael and Stan-
ley over Michael's stupidity. But
the dynamic of "Parks" differs:
Being a part of the Parks and
Recreation Department is a joke,
and everyone understands that

Not quite
'The office.
Yet, when asked, Tom doesn't
actually write down anything
Leslie says. He merely scribbles
on a piece of paper to appease her.
Similarly, the hunk at the work-
place who Leslie thinks she's in
a relationship with wants little
to do with her. There's also the
always-angered boss and the
always-bored college intern, who,
despite their differences, share a
powerful disdain for the forever-
cheery Leslie. So all that's new.
Still, that pesky feel of "The
Office" never quite goes away
during "Parks," reminding us
that while the show is no clone,
it certainly isn't a beacon of
originality. That's probably OK,
though, and it almost doesn't
matter; "Parks" is pretty much
assured to get relatively high rat-
ings. Its placement within NBC's
Thursday night comedic jugger-
naut lineup - which includes
"My Name is Earl" and "30 Rock"
as well as "The Office" - gives it
a boost most television shows
would kill for. So for the time
being, the soul searching can go
on hold, even though it seems
"Parks" is already on its way to
making a name for itself. At least
as much as it possibly can within
its restraints.

'Krod' is nothing but crud

By TOMMY COLEMAN

In 2007, "Epic Movie" topped the box office charts.
A year later, "Meet the Spartans"
achieved the same feat. Both mov-
ies were shoddily cooked up by
throwing scenes from recent popu- Krod

a scoop of potty humor and a few and the
tablespoons of pop culture refer- Flaing
ences. And despite being ripped
apart by critics, they enjoyed unde- SWord

Seeking to capitalize on the rat-
ings that an epic-fantasy parody Thursdays at
TV show could bring, Comedy 10:30 p.m.
Central unveiled its newest addi- Comedy Central
tion, "Krod Mandoon and the
Flaming Sword of Fire."
Like its predecessors, "Krod" doesn't seem too wor-
ried about its critical success. In fact, it's like "Epic
Movie" and "Meet the Spartans" in every way (except
there aren't any scenes pulled directly out of "Lord
of the Rings" or "Harry Potter" - or any other refer-
encestopopculture, forthatmatter). Otherwise it'sthe
same go-for-every-gag-possible routine, with the same
sometimes-it's-funny-but-usually-it's-not result.
In "Krod," a team of fighters is assembled to bring
down an evil empire against impossible odds. Unfor-
tunately, the actors playing the rebellious gang are
lackluster at best. Krod (Sean Maguire, "Meet the
Spartans"), plagued by a lack of self-confidence, is
expected to lead the battle against evil. But when
Maguire's unconvincing forehead-wrinkling look
of concern never changes, it's apparent that he will
bring little comedic value to the show.
The legion of actors Maguire commands is
equally lifeless. India de Beaufort ("Run, Fatboy,
Run") plays Aneka, Krod's on-and-off girlfriend

and a skilled Pagan warrior who gets Krod and his
pals out of several hairy situations. But her contri-
butions to the "humor" are nothing special, and it
seems that she may have been brought on purely as
eye-candy.
One of the show's few comedic bright spots is the
evil-but-incompetent Chancellor Dongalor (Matt
Lucas, "Little Britain USA"), leader of the Meconian
Empire. Whether he's sentencing those who doubt
totalitarianism to torture or plotting to destroy a vil-
lage with a weapon of mass destruction (known as
the Eye of Gulga Grymna), his conviction that he's the
best villain ever upstages even the most conceited evil
rulers. There's something brilliant yet simultaneously
disturbing about a man with this strength and will
power prancing around like a schoolgirl and asking
his assistant for fashion advice, occasionally showing
off his blindingly pale thighs in his favorite feathery
undergarment.
Bringing another much-needed dose of humor to
"Krod" are the British accents employed by Donga-
lor and his minions. British accents are classically
humorous, as seen with comedian Russell Brand and
in other epic fantasy comedies like "Monty Python
You'll laugh at the
name, but that's it.
and the Holy Grail." But the accents are pretty much
the only genuinely funny element of the show apart
from the villainous Dongalor. Everything else, like
Krod walking into a support beam, feels forced and
has been done before.
"Krod Mandoon and the Flaming Sword of Fire" is
plagued by a limp cast and an overuse of old and tired
gags. When it's all said and done, the show's name
may just be the funniest thing about it.

Malkovich shines in a sub-par film

By TIMOTHY RABB
Daily Arts Writer
Sometimes a film comes along
that can amuse an audience with
just a little bit of everything (a few
laugh-worthy
moments, a few
sighs in the the- 7k*
ater), but ulti-
mately has no The Great
lofty ambitions Buck Howard

predictability. At the Michigan
A ripple in the Bristol Bay
ocean of cine-
ma, "The Great
Buck Howard" ends, as T.S. Eliot
might say, "not with a bang but a
whimper."
The plot follows a young law
school dropout named Troy (Colin
Hanks, "King Kong"), who takes
a job as an assistant to the Great
Buck Howard (John Malkovich,
"Burn After Reading"), a washed-
up mentalist who seems to be igno-
rant of his own shameful state. In
spite of Troy's initial misgivings,
which stem primarily from Buck's
volatility, he perseveres and even-
tually witnesses Buck's resurgence
to fame by way of an awe-provok-
ing spectacle.
Though a comedy shouldn't be
expected to resort to ridiculous
measures to elicit laughter, the

movie doesn't make much of an
effort at comedy at all, nor does it
succeed in its attempt to adhere to
the "inspirational" genre. In fact,
the only cinematic aspect that
even seems to indicate a moment's
significance is the film's accompa-
nying score.
One need look no further than
the production credits to see why
the movie feels so familiar and
overwrought. The film is produced
by Tom Hanks, Colin Hanks's
real-life father (Tom even cameos
as Colin's father in the story). If
you've seen "Shawshank Redemp-
tion," "The Green Mile" or "For-
rest Gump," expect this movie to
be nothing more than a diluted
version of these landmark produc-
tions, with the all-too-familiar voi-
ceover to boot. Colin Hanls plays
his role satisfactorily, but does not
venture beyond the constraints of
the film or forge his own individ-
ual personality as a character. It's
unfortunate he didn't take advan-
tage of his prominent role and
showcase his acting talent.
In spite of the movie's promi-
nent flaws, the weight of the film's
redundancy is countered by the
superb theatrical abilities of its
lead performer, John Malkovich.
His obnoxious elitism manifests
itself vividly onscreen to inject life
and humor into what otherwise

may have been a deadpan disap-
pointment. Malkovich's personali-
ty undergoes a seamless transition
from the real world to the big
screen whenever he appears in a
movie; it's this genuine, raw dis-
play of humanity that lends an
endearing trademark to many of
his films.
Though totally forgettable due
to its homogeneity, "The Great
'Howard' is a
homogenous,
deflated 'Gump.'
Buck Howard"features alandmark
performance by John Malkovich
that is certainly worth your time.
Malkovich proves he can bear
the burden of a lead acting role in
addition to compensating for the
shortcomings of his more inexpe-
rienced co-stars. The movie also
alludes to Colin Hanks's poten-
tial as an up-and-coming actor,
though it certainly won't assure
his stardom. If you're a fan of the
inspirational comedy genre, "The
Great Buck Howard" will keep you
sufficiently entertained, albeit not
amazed.

The realRT

lying faster than the speed of
sound, replying "YES SIR!"
to every command, training
earlier in the mornings than the
average student wakes up for class.
Is this what you think of when you
hear R-O-T-C? Well, you're right...
sort of. You have definitely seen
us, the ones who walk around in
our "blues" every Thursday with
shiny black shoes and meticulously
pressed uniforms. You definitely
have some ideas about the kind of
people who call themselves cadets
do and stand for. Let me tell you a
little bit about why we do the things
we do and who we really are - and
then you can decide if your notions
are correct. .
No, we are not the Army. Yes,
we are students. No, we do not
fly for the Air Force... yet (and
that's only some of us). We are not
ultra-conservative, card-carrying
members of the National Rifle
Association. We did not join the
Air Force because we like or enjoy
war. We live in the dorms and off
campus, just like you-not in North
Hall, the Reserve Officer Training
Corps (ROTC) building between
the Natural History Museum and
the Dental School. We belong to
various campus organizations
including fraternities, sororities
and varsity athletics. We DO see
you staring at us - but it's OK,
we're used to it.
The purpose of Air Force ROTC
is to utilize the knowledge and
technical abilities of college stu-
dents and turn those students into
leaders who will serve to protect
the interests of the United States of
America. Have you ever seen the
"Bourne" trilogy? In the movie,
Matt Damon's character undergoes
intense training as an assassin to
become "better" in every way. That
is not at all what we do. We have
engineers, political science majors,
nursing students and movement
science majors. We are represented
in each of the University's under-
graduate programs. Everyone has a
personal and diverse level of exper-
tise that he or she brings to the
Air Force, and through ROTC, an
essential foundation is instilled and
practiced. These students will all
move into what we call the "active
duty" Air Force. We will be officers
first and our particular specialty
second, so we need to go through
a common training program - not

Jason Bourne training. Some of our
"training" is surprisingly very sim-
ilar to leadership and management
courses offered at the Ross School
of Business. We learn how to prob-
lem solve in high-intensity envi-
ronments so as cadets, we can keep
our cool and make sound decisions
when under a great deal of pres-
sure. Then we take it a step further
and complete in-depth, specialized
training such as small team tactics,
cyber warfare simulations and cul-
tural immersion programs in places
like Brazil and South Africa.
All of these complimentary
experiences and the professional
development we get from being
part of Air Force ROTC really is
awesome. In fact, it is the best edu-
cation I've had. But the best part
of Air Force ROTC is the connec-
tion that is developed between all
of us. Nothing brings people closer
than enduring a common hardship.
Working with driven, goal-orient-
ed, funny-as-hell individuals cre-
ates a bond that will only continue
to grow when we join the Air Force
upon graduation.
Yeah, we wake up early and work
out, do all this extracurricular
training and wear uniforms once or
twice a week. But we are students
just like everyone else here. We will
graduate with a degree and com-
mission into the Air Force, just as
you will graduate and begin work-
ing as professionials in your field.
What separates us is the amount
of responsibility we will have from
the get-go and the enormity of
our pursuits. About 10 percent of
us will fly a $130 million aircraft.
Note, also, that not everyone in the
Air Force flies. Some of us will head
up multi-million dollar acquisition
projects, while others will lead
the world's finest warriors into an
austere environment to secure ter-
ritory for extracting civilians from
a war zone. When we decide it is
time to leave the military, whether
that's after four years or 24 years,
we will have acquired a long list
of accomplishments that would be
unattainable for those who didn't
wake up at the crack of dawn for
four years.
That's what Air Force ROTC is.
What are you doing next year?

FITNESS
From Page 6B
ELLIPTICAL INEQUITY
Canning said that the philoso-
phy in creating modern fitness cen-
ters demands more natural lighting
and larger windows in order to
make the space seem more open.
He added that .the state-of-the-
art technology for cardiovascular
machines includes individual mul-
timedia stations with each piece of
equipment so that users can enter-
tain themselves without worrying
about dropping iPods or balancing
textbooks.
If you'd like to see a modern
weight room and gymnasium for
students on campus, venture to the
basement of the new Ross School
of Business. The center features
brand new equipment and nine
large flat-screen TVs lining the wall
in front of the elliptical machines.
Of course, you can only go here if
you're in the business school and
pay the $100 membership fee. Kine-
siology students must be scratching
their heads in frustration. r
At the three facilities open to
all students, the atmosphere of the
weightrooms is thesame. No televi-
sions, music playing or windows -
just musty air filled with the smell
of sweat and the sound of weights

dropping on the rubber floors,
punctuated with a few grunts. At
many times during the day, people
wait in line to use 25- and 30-pound
dumbbells while heavier weights
remain untouched.
Cardiovascular rooms at cam-
pus's main buildings differ a bit
more. At times in the IMSB, a pleas-
ant breeze and the sound of birds
permeates from outside. But the
main room at the CCRB resembles
a sweaty, windowless dungeon,
and many of the cardiovascular
machines are in a former racquet-
ball court. The NCRB is perhaps
the most pitiful - space is so lim-
ited that elliptical machines stand
in the front hallway.
For some of the common use
equipment, it's only a matter of time
until upgrades will be unavoidable.
Canning said that some tread-
mills in the IMSB are approaching
120,000 miles of usage. He estimat-
ed that the lifetime of the average
treadmill is roughly a third of that
and credited an outstanding main-
tenance crew for getting the most
from the machines.
Although the . maintenance
workers should be commended for
lengthening the lifespan of equip-
ment, the statistics from the report
scream for the revamping of fitness
centers across campus. With ellip-

tical machines on their last legs,
campus gyms exemplify the "high
school gymnasium and weight
room" atmosphere that the task
force alluded to in its report.
The task before the administra-
tion, should they choose to go for-
ward with the recommendations,
is immense. But the University
of Michigan is a massive institu-
tion with excellent resources, and
many smaller schools with fewer
resources have been able to pro-
vide top-notch facilities for their
students.
Listed in the report as schools
with admirable, contemporary
facilities were nearby Oakland Uni-
versity, Miami University in Ohio
and Saginaw Valley State Univer-
sity, a Division III school.
"In terms of lifting and total
workout space, it was actually larg-
er at Miami, a school less than half
the size of Michigan," said Kend-
all, who spent his freshman year at
Miami.
While the endowment is not
where funding would come from
for new facilities at the Univer-
sity of Michigan, it is worth not-
ing that its endowment of $6.5
billion is approximately 20 times
that of Miami - which illustrates
a huge disparity in overall financial
resources between the schools.

The pool in the CCRB is open for lap swimming during set hours

IS IT FEASIBLE?
Allocating more funds toward
recreational facilities as outlined
in the report recommendations
would mean either cuts to depart-
ments or a tuition hike, Provost
Sullivan told The Michigan Daily
in an article published Mar. 31.
Because of that, Sullivan wasn't
sure to what extent the adminis-
tration would adopt new projects
for improving facilities.
On the other hand, the task force
,seemed to already have found the
answer.
"A majority of students said they
would easily pay a $100 fee for new
recreation facilities at U of M," the
task force wrote in its Recreation
Feasibility Study after consulting
their focus group.
Within the same study, one
student was also quoted saying,
"This is Michigan, and we don't do
things halfway! We have the Big
House; we should also have the Big
REC!"
Still, with the national economy
in shambles, there is the question
of whether taking on more proj-
ects at this time really the respon-
sible thing to do.
While many schools have cut
new projects and spending, Can-
ning proposed that conditions are
actually quite favorable for the
University to take on such a proj-
ect.
"There are lots of people -
architects, planners, suppliers,
trade skill workers - who are look-
ing for work right now," Canning .
said. "That becomes a very advan-

tageous time to have a project go
out for a competitive bid."
Even if prices for such a project
don't come at much of a discount,
there is also the positive external-
ity of creating jobs through the
project.
The University applied this New
Deal strategy with the $108 mil-
lion purchase of the Pfizer facility
in January, where it aims to cre-
ate more than 2,000 jobs over the
course of a decade.
Sullivan also told the Daily that
the proposals to fund recreational
facilities do fit wellwith recent Uni-
versity initiatives. She described
one as promoting "active lifestyles
for students and faculty," appar-
ently referencing the MHealthy
campaign begun in 2005 by Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman.
The link between new fitness
facilities and more active lifestyles
doesn't need too much explaining.
Sullivan also saw new facilities
helping admission, another aim of
MHealthy.
Improving recreational sports
and fitness facilities is something
students and faculty both want.
The studies presented also show
that students are willing to pay for
it, and it's something that lines up
perfectly with the priorities of the
University's administration while
aiding the economy. In short, the
time is now.
"The statement that keeps ring-
ing in my hear is, 'Why can't our
facilities be better?"' Canning said.
"Because we have the leaders and
best. And that's an expectation."

THE CCRB IS OUT OF SHAPE
Campus fitness facilities are weak compared to colleges with fewer resources.
It's time that the University listens to students and whips campus gyms into shape.

By Roger Sauerhaft
Daily Staff Writer
When LSA junior Jeff Kendall
first stepped foot in the Central
Campus Recreational Building
(CCRB), his first impression was
that the facilities appeared dated,
reminding him of the shabby com-
munity center in his hometown of
Midland, Mich.
"They really should reconsider
how they put it together," Kendall
said. "I think we have a lot of work
to do in terms of our recreational
facilities, especially at theCCRB. It's
just so dated for such a large school
with such great resources."
Common gripes with the rec-
reational facilities on campus are
what led to the creation of the Rec-
reational Sports Task Force, which
issued a 91-page report in March
recommending major changes to
campus recreational facilities. Data
was compiled from a survey con-
ducted by the task force starting in
fall 2007.
The task force most strongly
advocated changes to the CCRB, the
North Campus Recreational Build-
ing (NCRB) and the Intramural
Sports Building (IMSB).
The recommendations made in
the report, commissioned hy Pro-
vost Teresa Sullivan and Vice Presi-
dent of Student Affairs E. Royster
Harper, undoubtedly added to
the administration's lengthy list
of needs amid financial strife. But
many say this call to action is well
overdue, especially given the prog-
ress made by institutions that com-
pete with Michigan for students.
As a measure of comparison,
the task force surveyed the fitness
facilities of 11 other universities -
seven other Big Ten schools, Stan-
ford, Maryland, Texas and Virginia.
To put it lightly, the University of
Michigan didn't measure up.
From the list of 11, only Purdue
and Penn State had a lower ratio of
square footage per student. Iowa,
which plans to open its new $69
million facility later this year, will
have well more than double Michi-
gan's space (17.13 ft. to 6.97 ft.) per
student.
The new Ross School of Business
boasts a shiny new fitness center
which is only available to business

VIDEO OF
THE WEEK
Intro to dancing
On weekend nights, many students
flood the dance clubs near campus to
let loose and have a good time. Some
of those students are experienced
dancers who are confident in their
skills on the floor. Others might do
well to watch this video.
Titled "How to Dance Without
Embarrassing Yourself," this video
comically lists nine steps to improve
your dance moves and avoid making
a fool out of yourself. As the narra-
tor says, "It's easier than you think to
shake your moneymaker, even if you
happen to be a maniac on the floor."
The subject of the video is a stocky
man dressed in drag, wearing red
lipstick, a dress and a blonde wig. As
he's awkwardly dancing in the back-
ground, the narrator says that you'll
need music, a place to dance and a
mirror. In learning how to dance,
there are apparently two optional
parts: alcohol and a dance partner.
The narrator proceeds to list the
nine seeps. In one of the steps, the
narrator advises you to stand next to
someone who is drawing a lot of atten-
tion, which would deflect any criti-
cism of yourbad dancing. You are also
told to avoid emulating other dancers
because "that's creepy." Most impor-
tant, don't break dance, "krump,"
attempt any Justin Timberlake moves
or scream "Ooh, ooh."
Keep these steps in mind for the
next time you're at Necto.

THEME PARTY SUGGESTION
The final hoorah - With classes ending on Tues-
day, you've got one last weekend to throw a blowout
before finals start. You better make it good. That
means no Natty, no Five O'Clock Vodka and no
Boone's Farm. Even if the party gets raucous, you
still need to say goodbye to the '08-'09 school year
with class. The first nice day, host a spring whites
luncheon. Good music, fresh belinis and dank weed.
Stay classy.
Throwing this party? Let us know. TheStatement@umich.edu
STUDY OF THE WEEK
Brown fat in adults can burn calories
Almost every adult has little pockets of brown fat that can burn
many calories when triggered by the cold, according to several stud-
ies published last week in The New England Journal of Medicine that
examined the presence of brown fat in humans.
Inone of the studies, researchers looked at 1,972 people who had
undergone PKT-CT scans for different reasons. After analyzing the
scans, they concluded that brown fat existed in 7.5 percent of the
women and 3 percent of the men. In another study, researchers had
five healthy adults sit in one room with a normal temperature and one
room that was cold. After scanning the subjects in each room, those
who were in the cold room showed signs of brown fat.
After conductingthe studies, the researchers concluded that brown
fat consumes calories and produces heat when someone is sitting in a
chilly atmosphere, like a room that has a temperature between 61 and
66 degrees.
