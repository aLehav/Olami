David 
Blaauw 
and 
Dennis 
Sylvester, 
electrical 
engineering 
and 
computer 
science 
professors 
at 
the 
University of Michigan, are 
this year’s recipients of the 
2019 Distinguished University 
Innovator Award, an honor 
given to University faculty 
who have both developed and 
marketed innovative ideas or 
technologies.
The two professors will 
be recognized on Oct. 22 
at Celebrate Invention, an 
event 
honoring 
inventions 
and 
entrepreneurship 
from 
University staff members.
Blaauw and Sylvester first 
began doing research together 
at the University in 2001, 
focusing on the development of 
low power integrated circuits. 
Blaauw said the award is an 
appreciated acknowledgement 
of the work the researchers 
have done and recognized 
students as a major factor in 
moving the research forward.
“We 
don’t 
think 
about 
awards very much,” Blaauw 
said. “It’s nice because we’ve 
been working for a long time 
together … It’s a nice milestone 
to mark, and I can reflect on all 
the work that (our) students 
have done.”

Sylvester also echoed the 
importance of students in 
transformative 
research. 
He said he has worked with 
multiple students who believe 
in a technology and have the 
ability to take it to the market. 
Though he and Blaauw play 
a role, Sylvester said, the 
students become the key driver 
in the success of the product.
“It’s a testament to the 
area of work that I’ve been 
investing a lot of my time and 
career into, Sylvester said. 
“Between David and I, we’ve 
worked with probably 100 
Ph.D. and master’s students 
over the last 15 to 16 years on 
these topics. All of them play 
a role in moving the research 
forward and eventually getting 
into commercialization and 
impact and industry.”
When they first began 
working 
together, 
Blaauw 
and Sylvester focused on 
computer-aided 
design 
which generated software to 
create computer chips. They 
later decided to design and 
build the chips themselves 
and 
have 
been 
working 
closely ever since, Sylvester 
said.

Hundreds 
of 
students, 
faculty and local community 
members gathered in Rackham 
Auditorium Friday to hear former 
United States Secretary of State 
Condoleezza Rice discuss life, 
career and her reflections on 
several specific points of policy. 
Rice served as Secretary of 
State under President George 
Bush from 2005 to 2009. She was 
the first Black woman to hold 
the position, after working as 
Bush’s national security advisor 
from 2001 to 2005. Currently, 
she is the Denning Professor in 
Global Business and Economy at 
the Stanford Graduate School of 
Business.
The 
event 
was 
held 
in 
conjunction with then opening 
of the Weiser Diplomacy Center. 

The 
Center 
was 
established 
with funding from University 
of Michigan Regent Ron Weiser 
(R) and his wife Eileen Weiser 
in order to institute a leading 
school of international policy in 
the Midwest. Since its launch, 
the center has been committed 
to bringing in speakers from the 
world of international diplomacy 
within a wide range of viewpoints.
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel introduced Rice and 
pointed out her unique position 
as a figure both in the worlds of 
policy and academia.
“It would be hard to imagine 
someone 
who 
typifies 
the 
confluence 
of 
academia 
and 
international affairs better that 
Secretary 
Condoleezza 
Rice,” 
Schlissel said. “Her extraordinary 
career has furthered both, always 
fueled by her deep commitment to 
public service.” 
Rice began her undergraduate 

career as a student at the 
University of Denver with the 
intention of becoming a classical 
pianist. After attending the Aspen 
Music Festival the summer after 
her sophomore year, she realized 
she was underprepared compared 
to her classmates. As a result, 
she happened to take a course in 
international politics at the end of 
her junior year, and immediately 
felt a calling to a new career path. 
 “I wandered into my course 
at the end of my junior year in 
international politics that was 
taught by a man named Josef 
Korbel — who happened to be 
Madeleine Albright’s father,” Rice 
said. “He opened up this world of 
diplomacy to me ... and I knew all 
of a sudden what I wanted to be.” 
 
LSA 
senior 
Kate 
Westa, 
co-president of WeListen, an 
organization aimed to foster 
bipartisan 
conversation 
on 
political 
topics 
attended 
the 

event. She explained to The 
Daily that while she had always 
looked up to Rice, she specifically 
appreciated 
the 
ideological 
diversity of the speakers the 
Weiser Center brings, as it 
allowed 
her 
to 
understand 
diplomacy in a comprehensive 
way.
“I 
have 
looked 
up 
to 
Condoleezza Rice since I was 
probably 8 years old—I used to 
write to the White House about 
her,” Westa said. “I think hearing 
all aspects of the foreign services 
and everything related to foreign 
policy is very important—we’ll 
hear 
from 
former 
Secretary 
(Hillary) Clinton as well. I 
think it’s so important to hear 
the different aspects of the job 
and the different perspectives 
because there is so much going on 
in international relations.”

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

The Michigan Community 
Scholars Program celebrated 
its 20th anniversary at Palmer 
Commons on Friday night with a 
dinner, sing-alongs and remarks 
by community members. Over 50 
people attended the celebration. 
MCSP 
is 
a 
learning 
community founded within LSA 
in 1999, focused on community 
service and social justice. Like 
other 
living-and-learning 
environments at the University 
of Michigan, MCSP students live 
and take classes together in the 
West Quad Residence Hall. 
David Schoem, founder and 
director of MCSP, opened the 
event by welcoming everyone 
back to Ann Arbor. He explained 
he created MCSP to be a force of 
good among competing social 
tensions.
“The challenge facing MCSP, 
today and in 1999, is in the face 
of despair and violence and 
hate in the broader society, how 
can we embrace and put all our 
positive and good together in an 
educational setting?” Schoem 
said. “In a community that 

actually lives and breathes and 
learns the values of dialogue 
and diversity … this has been the 
great opportunity of MCSP.”
In 
his 
speech, 
Timothy 
McKay, LSA associate dean for 
undergraduate education, called 
MCSP one of the signature 

successes of LSA. According to 
McKay, the program exemplifies 
how 
higher 
education 
institutions 
should 
teach 
students the ability to engage in 
civic and public life. 
“The work of MCSP rests at 
the very heart of the purpose of 

liberal arts education,” McKay 
said. 
“It 
aims 
to 
cultivate 
precisely this kind of full-fledged 
participatory readiness … and it 
helps the rest of the college see 
how that might be done.”

RESEARCH


Rice delved into a discussion 
of pivotal points of foreign policy 
she influenced while in office 
— namely the war in Iraq. She 
acknowledged the controversial 
nature of the decision and 
conceded that policies were 
largely influenced by the context 
of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
“We were a lot more on edge 
about what could happen by the 
time of the Iraq evasion than we 
would have prior to 9/11,” Rice 
said. “I wish the intelligence 
would have been better. I still 
think the Middle East is better 
off 
without 
(Former 
Iraqi 
President) Saddam Hussein. But 
we made mistakes in the post-
war period ... It’s very difficult to 
understand a system that’s that 
opaque.” 
Reflecting 
on 
domestic 
economic policy, Rice discussed 
how the so-called ‘American 
dream’ often feels inaccessible 
to 
many 
Americans. 
She 
cited symptoms of late-stage 
capitalism, such as growing 
inequality 
and 
stagnant 
mobility, as the point of growing 
frustration 
among 
a 
large 
portion of the public. 
“Particularly for a country 
where we are not united by 
ethnicity, nationality or religion, 
but by idea: You can come from 
humble 
circumstances, 
you 
can do great things,” Rice said. 
“That better be true! And for too 
many people it isn’t true.”
 In order to help mediate this 
growing achievement gap, Rice 
called on academic institutions 
such 
as 
the 
University 
to 
ensure the stepping stones to a 
brighter future are continuously 
available to students in lower 
socioeconomic classes. 
 “If you’re a great university 
like Michigan … the one thing 
you’ve got to do is to make sure 
that these places are open to 
the entire bottom of pyramid, 
so that people have a way to the 
top of the pyramid,” Rice said. 
“Because if it’s ever the case that 
you get to places like this from 
the top of the pyramid, you’re 
toast.”

When 
asked 
to 
give 
advice to the current Trump 
administration and members of 
Congress, Rice noted how the 
current administration faces an 
obstacle she said she did not have 
at the time: Twitter protocol. 
Rice noted the decision-making 
process can be corroded if 
politicians 
automatically 
go 
to social media to try to push 
policy ideas. 
“If I would say one thing to 
both ends of 1600 Pennsylvania 
Avenue — the Congress and 
the White House — before you 
tweet, think,” Rice said. “If 
you are absolutely responsible 
for our democracy and you say 
whatever comes to mind, do 
you know how that’s not a good 
thing?”
After the discussion, Public 
Policy junior Brett Zaslavsky 
explained he appreciated Rice’s 
positive outlook on America’s 
role in international diplomacy. 
“I think the most inspiring 
thing about the lecture today 
was that Dr. Rice outlined a 
fairly optimistic view of foreign 
policy and of America’s place 
in the world going forward,” 
Zaslavsky said. “I think getting 
the opportunity to hear that 
from a career diplomat and 
somebody who has so much 
experience with the foreign 
service was hugely insightful.” 
Rice advised students the 
career 
paths 
and 
personal 
passions they take up may 
not perfectly align with the 
preconceived notions society 
hold may hold. She challenged 
students to find something 
they love despite what outside 
individuals may deem suitable 
for them. 
“Nobody 
would 
have 
looked at me, a Black girl from 
Birmingham, 
Alabama, 
and 
said ‘you’re going to be a Soviet 
specialist,’” Rice said. “So, your 
passion might turn out to be 
something that doesn’t look 
like you. I was fortunate to find 
something I really loved, so once 
you’ve done that, things have a 
way of working out.”

For 
a 
majority 
of 
the 
celebration, more than 20 
individuals 
currently 
and 
formerly involved with MCSP 
spoke for two minutes each, 
sharing their memories of 
the program and how it 
shaped their undergraduate 
experience.
Danny 
Lambouths 
III 
was part of MCSP’s first 
class. Because of the positive 
influence the program has 
had on his life, Lambouths 
III said he was compelled to 
help create a similar living-
and-learning community at 
the University of Illinois at 
Chicago where he now works. 
“Through MCSP, I learned 
the value of service and the 
power 
of 
student 
voice,” 
Lambouths said. “I witnessed 
firsthand that when you put 
good into the world, goodness 
comes back.”
Gilbert 
Nuñez, 
another 
MCSP alum, explained the 
close-knit 
quality 
of 
the 

program was key to helping 
him adjust to a large campus 
as a first-generation student. 
Even post-college, Nuñez said, 
MCSP still plays a significant 
role in his life.
“When 
I 
moved 
to 
Washington, D.C. eight years 
ago, it was MCSP people who 
met us at our new apartment 
and helped us unload boxes,” 
Nuñez 
said. 
“It’s 
MCSP 
people that we still have 
friendsgiving 
with 
every 
year. When I moved jobs a 
year-and-a-half ago, it was to 
work at an organization with 
another MCSP person. And 
of course, the person I get to 
spend every day with, I met 
through MCSP in Couzens 
Hall sixteen years ago.” 
Though 
the 
program 
emphasized diversity from 
the beginning, Schoem said 
he is especially proud MCSP 
has developed into one of the 
most diverse programs on 
campus.

ILLUSTRATION COURTESY OF THE AUTHOR

When you miss the dining hall 
hours, delivery apps are there for 
you. Scrolling through sandwiches, 
burritos and pizzas, I decided to go 
for dumplings today. Everything 
was fine until I received the plastic 
bag from the delivery man, who 
then put his hands together and 
said “xiexie.”
First, I’m Korean, not Chinese. 
Just because I’m Asian and I 
ordered dumplings doesn’t make 
me Chinese. And second, putting 
hands together while bowing is an 
outdated Asian stereotype that not 
all of us do. Such experiences are 
actually not quite new to us. When 
an Italian vendor did the exact 
same thing to me last summer, I 
corrected him: “Thank you, but 
I’m not Chinese. I’m Korean.” 
When a French guest at a museum 
passed me a Chinese floor guide, 

I thought it wasn’t even worth 
reacting. These instances can be 
considered as microaggressions, 
and here’s why.
Misidentifying 
non-Chinese 
Asians as Chinese is more than 
just an insensitivity. It contains a 
context of reducing each diverse 
and distinctive Asian culture into 
one, which in this case is China. It 
is the selective indifference toward 
non-Western cultures displayed 
without any consciousness. Most 
white Americans – and even people 
like me – are able to distinguish 
and specify Western cultures, 
but they tend to lump all Asian 
cultures into one category. In their 
perception, Western cultures are 
recognized on the national level, 
such as French or Italian, while the 
rest at the continental level, Asian.
Such 
tendencies 
are 
well 
reflected in my experiences in the 
Western world. In the media, it is 
not hard to find Asian characters 
with 
random 
stereotypes 

adopted 
from 
everywhere 
in 
Asian countries. An Australian 
comedian dressed in Kimono 
to parody the trademark North 
Korean news anchor is the epitome 
of this. At a design critique, no one 
pointed out what was wrong about 
the cover of a Japanese folk tale 
with Chinese porcelain patterns. 
Such examples of false mix-ups 
reflect their selective indifference 
to distinct Asian cultures. This 
is not a matter of knowledge or 
intelligence, but a matter of lacking 
the willingness to show respect 
and 
acknowledge 
differences 
among Asian cultures. I do not 
intend to disdain those who fail 
to distinguish between different 
cultures. 
However, 
displaying 
selective ignorance toward certain 
cultures does reflect how they 
regard Asians in Western society.
The 
diversity 
within 
us 
deserves recognition. Our cultures 
deserve as distinctive attention as 
the Western ones. Just because 

someone orders pizza, doesn’t 
mean that person is Italian or 
speaks Italian. If that sounds like a 
nonsense, so is saying “xiexie” to a 
Korean.

Though I don’t believe that 
being a doctor is for me, I do hold 
the belief that more Black doctors 
are needed. The question is, how 
do we motivate young Black 
people interested in medicine to 
actually pursue it? Growing up, I 
was completely set on becoming a 
doctor. I thought that I was going to 
become the next best pediatrician. 
However, as I grew up and began to 
explore my passions and interests, I 
realized that medicine may not be 
for me. I know that many people 
feel the pressure to become a doctor 
throughout their childhood, and 
once they actually try it, are unable 
to carry on due to lack of motivation. 
However, I do believe that there 
are many young Black people who 
genuinely hold an interest of being a 
doctor but unfortunately something 
happens to push them out of it and 
they eventually stop their journey. 
I often feel guilty about holding 
such a strong belief that we need 
more Black people in the medical 
field, but choosing not to pursue 
it myself. Recently however, I had 
an experience that made me feel 
validated in my beliefs.
About three weeks ago I was 
rushed to the hospital due to some 
physical issues that I have been 
dealing with for a while now. I 
ended up having to be admitted to 
the hospital and was there for three 
days. During those three days I 
counted three other Black people 
who weren’t my parents or other 
patients: a maintenance woman, a 
police officer, and a resident medical 

student. While all of these roles are 
helpful to the general public, I felt 
joy when I saw the resident student. 
It was interesting because I feel like 
I have never wished more success on 
someone I’ve literally never talked 
to before. I hoped so badly that the 
student would successfully finish up 
her studies and become a doctor. 
I had that feeling of hope when 
I saw the Black medical student 
because during my three days in 
the hospital I had to talk to many 
doctors which was very stressful 
and honestly fueled my anxiety. 
But when I was around the Black 
student doctor, something changed. 
I began to feel much more calm and 
comfortable when telling my story. 
I learned during my three days 
in the hospital that having Black 
doctors take care of Black patients 
is so essential because it just makes 
us feel more at home. Even though 
I didn’t know the student at all and 
never even exchanged words with 
them, just having them there made 
me feel reassured that someone 
was actually there to take care of 
me. It is difficult to describe but 
when someone who shares an 
aspect of your life as close to you 
or important to you tries to explain 
something that is happening, you 
truly understand the impact and 
the passion that they share with 
you. I did end up having a doctor 
of color while I was in the hospital 
and though she was extremely 
straightforward 
with 
me 
and 
honestly did not try to beat around 
the bush at all, I felt so comforted 
after she left. I knew for sure that 
she was on top of the issue and was 
going to do everything she could to 
help me get better.

My tequila on the rocks
Because rough edges make a 
real man.
 
Sin trabajo no se ase.
 
So… even my drunk I work
For. Sober I’m stuck, so I want 
more.
Lately, my garden’s fought 
droughts and weeds,
And we must thrust ourselves 
forward
If we want to succeed.
 
Planta la semilla y la flor no 
tarda en venir...
 
Those damn lilac soft lips,
Wide promiscuous hips,
And eyes that scorch me crisp
A description of an angel that 
feels so devilish,
it’s an eclipse.
 
Una vibra no cambia aunque la 
pintes.

 The bar’s reeking of a wretched 
liquor settles,
Instead,
A fragrance of a magnificent 
meadow.
Promising so much,
I can almost feel her petals.
 
Pero en la fortuna, existe la 
inconsecuencia, no como la luna

 
Brown eyes are simple,
But yours are comforting
Honey chocolate melting pots.
When we saw each other, I was 
shot…
With shocks and lots of knots.
 
You’re right I need to shut up, I 
talk a lot.
Talking to kissing, if this isn’t 
love
Then what is missing?
With an invitation to my dorm, 
a thought was sinking.
Seductive thoughts, they must 
drown to avoid imagining the not-
yet-existing.
 
Ahora no más es darle sol y 
pasión.
Así es como el romance de la rosa 
canta su canción.
 We’ve finally made it into my 
environment,
but I’m losing my flow.
I’ll pour one in that streams
like a fiery rain.
 
“You’ve had me waiting, are you 
just gonna stand there?”
 
A stare so rare that I must 
beware,
but if I’m being honest, I really 
don’t care.
Asking you if you were ready… 
my lasered sight was steady.

You had me breathing heavy, 
who knew oxygen was so scarce 
in heaven.
And I have a confession, the 
seven butterflies in my stomach 
became eleven.
If you were a poison, I’d want 
it prolonged like a slow killing 
venom.
 
Ahora hasta las flores brillan 
con tu amor. Cuando estoy a tu lado 
hasta siento el color.
Nada tan encantador como ese 
olor… Y entiendo que tus espinas te 
protegen,
te acaricio sin sentir el dolor. 
 
I woke up and you were up 
changing, well here’s my number, 
I’ll see you soon,
same arrangements?
“You are the cutest. Everything 
good doesn’t need to last forever, 
ya know?”
 Wait — What? I mean, I guess 
so.
But you know, I meant what I 
said, and more so
I would’ve done it all over again, 
if I knew there’d never be another 
hello.
Man wait, hell no, you know 
what? Thank you.
Even the rose that withers 
too soon, still gave a beautiful 
experience when it bloomed.

I’ve been staring at the 
checkbox labeled “African-
American” for 20 minutes 
now. I can’t seem to look past 
the dash which separates 
these two worlds. To be 
Nigerian-American is to be 
the Atlantic Ocean, to be 
divide, to have two houses 
but no home. I am constantly 
crossing the Atlantic. Some 
days, I slave trade my accent 
for whitewashed inflections 
still stained enough to prove 
I don’t belong. Some days, 
I whitewash reflections of 
the slave trade, say them, 
not us, just to prove I don’t 
belong. Other days, I pick 

a side, bring the trade to 
an end. Tired of seeing my 
people pretend and stuff our 
meaning 
behind 
western 
culture and call it posh, call 
it bougie, call it right. It’s not 
white- I mean, it’s not right if 
the cream leaves you cream if 
your knuckles are still Black. 
But is this my fight?
Melanin needs to come 
back. I’m tired of seeing 
skinny 
white 
women 
on 
TV. I don’t know why but 
something about it irks me, 
something about it hurts me 
to see how media doesn’t 
believe my Black body is 
enough. My Black body is 
enough. I’m tired of having 
to yell that while watching 
House of Cards. Tired of 
Black bodies playing second-

fiddle to the stars, we deserve 
the applause and the main 
role too. We can be president, 
front stage, with natural hair 
too. But is this my right? 
Other days, I can’t fight. No 
common ground in sight I 
resolve to be white. To be a 
blank canvas, not colored by 
either side, hoping to find a 
balance, I silence the parts of 
me which carry rage. I silence 
the parts of me which hope to 
engage in the war that is my 
skin, in the battle that is my 
tongue, in the struggle that 
is my hair. I resolve to not 
care, pretend to be fair, but 
this only lasts for a while... 
20 minutes to be exact, the 
question brings me back, are 
you African or are you Black?

T

he nearly three years 
of 
Donald 
Trump’s 
presidency 
have 
been 
an absolute whirlwind. From 
sexual assault accusations to the 
Sharpie scandal, there hasn’t 
been a second for us to catch 
our breath. Every time a scandal 
happens, people call for Trump’s 
impeachment. Yet, he seems to 
get past each scandal relatively 
unharmed. 
That 
was 
until 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, 
D-Calif., who had previously been 
hesitant to bring impeachment 
to the table, decided enough 
was enough and announced a 
formal 
impeachment 
inquiry 
into President Trump (though 
he is still relatively unharmed). 
This came after a whistleblower 
complaint 
that 
Trump 
had 
allegedly pressured Ukrainian 
President Volodymyr Zelensky 
into investigating former Vice 
President Joe Biden and his son 
Hunter Biden. He also allegedly 
threatened to withhold aid to 
Ukraine should Zelensky not 
comply. While the impeachment 
inquiry should be exciting news 
to many Democrats, they should 
also be concerned.
There are two main reasons 
Democrats are excited about the 
news of a possible impeachment, 
with the first being their pure 
disdain for Trump. More than 
200 House Democrats have a 
burning desire to see Trump 
kicked out of office. Presidential 
candidate 
former 
Rep. 
Beto 
O’Rourke, D-Texas, hammered 
Trump as being “sick” and 
“unfit for this office.” The only 
problem is that calling someone 
unfit isn’t a good enough reason 
for impeachment. Each party 
will claim that a president of 
the opposing party is unfit — 
that is party politics. However, 
pressuring a foreign leader to dig 
up dirt on a presidential candidate 
and his son may be the straw that 
breaks the camel’s back, and it 

ultimately made Pelosi fold on 
pushing off impeachment. 
The 
other 
reason 
many 
Democrats want to see Trump 
impeached 
is 
because 
doing 
so would set a precedent. If 
Democrats 
do 
not 
pursue 
impeachment, 
then 
Trump’s 
illegal 
actions 
will 
become 
commonplace. One of the most 
dangerous 
things 
in 
politics 
is precedent. If Trump can do 
something illegal, what stops the 
next president from taking the 
same course of action? 

While many Democrats may 
be gung-ho about impeachment, 
they should be extremely wary 
of pushing ahead. I believe it 
is incredibly important for the 
Democrats to not allow a precedent 
to be set, but there is a much more 
present danger of impeachment. 
Should the Democrats in the 
House succeed in bringing up 
charges of impeachment, Sen. 
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and his 
colleagues in the Senate would not 
convict Trump and remove him 
from office. It would be totally off-
color for McConnell. He blocked 
President 
Barack 
Obama’s 
Supreme Court appointee and has 
blocked numerous bills that have 
recently passed in the U.S. House, 
including election security bills 
and gun control legislation. In 
order for the Senate to convict 
Trump and remove him from 
office there would need to be a 
two-thirds majority in the Senate. 
In this political era, it’s rare to 

get senators on the same page 
for simple things, so it would be 
virtually impossible to get enough 
of them to agree on something as 
polarizing as convicting Trump. 
What 
would 
a 
failed 
impeachment 
mean 
for 
Democrats? Well, for starters, 
the public appearance of the 
Democratic 
party 
would 
be 
tarnished. 
An 
impeachment 
without 
conviction 
would 
validate Trump’s claim that the 
continual calls for impeachment 
were a giant witch hunt. The 
bigger problem for Democrats 
would be the energy boost that 
Trump’s base would receive: His 
rallies would be bigger, and his 
donations would skyrocket. It is 
not hard for one to imagine the 
rhetoric Trump would come up 
with after not being convicted. 
There would be endless name 
calling 
and 
hateful 
Twitter 
rants in all caps. Giving Trump 
momentum into an election year 
would be a very costly mistake 
for the Democrats. It could end 
in disaster for the party with 
Trump getting elected again 
in 2020. All it takes is to go on 
Twitter to already see how his 
base is reacting. Many of them 
are claiming that it’s all a lie 
and the Democrats are trying to 
steal the election, including the 
presidency.
Democrats have consistently 
said the main goal of 2020 is 
defeating Trump. While many 
see impeachment as one of the 
possible avenues to do that, I do 
not view it as the ideal pathway 
to Democratic success. If the 
Democrats really want to turn 
the country around, they should 
beat Trump outright in the 
2020 general election and avoid 
the chaos of a failed Trump 
impeachment, and the inevitable 
division that will arise with it.

Impeachment isn’t all fun and games

The importance of color in our world

JONATHAN VAYSMAN | COLUMN

D

uring a meeting for a 
student 
organization 
I’m involved in, we had 
an icebreaker activity 
that asked, “Would 
you rather be color-
blind or lose your 
taste 
buds?” 
After 
pondering the idea for 
a couple of seconds, I 
walked to the side of 
the room representing 
the latter, where the 
minority 
of 
people 
stood. 
I 
justified 
losing my taste buds 
because 
theoretically 
losing 
my ability to see color was 
unimaginable. For me, there’s a 
powerful emotional significance 
to the various colors that I see 
every day. Colors reflect mood, 
purpose and the uniqueness 
of living and nonliving beings. 
I believe it’s ultimately our 
responsibility to recognize that 
diminishing color from our lives, 
such as in the natural spaces 
around us and in the people 
among us, means diminishing 
our ability to mold a society 
whose functional potential can 
be powerfully multidimensional 
and far-reaching.
The presence of color in our 
surrounding 
environments 
serves as an untold essential 
contributor 
to 
our 
mental 
health. A 2006 study confirms 
that spending time in nature 
can counteract the toxic stress 
that occurs in our daily lives 
because 
viewing 
stimulating 
natural scenes can create a 
pleasurable experience for the 
brain. Another study discovered 
that plant life can have similar 
biological influences on the body 
as aromatherapy, a phenomenon 
essentially 
built 
on 
the 
collective leverage of the visual, 
olfactory and touching senses 
with each other. When placed in 
a workspace with a multicolored 
personality in its greenery and 
abundant sunlight, employees 
demonstrated 
a 
15-percent 
increase in reported well-being. 
Unknowingly, we are uplifted 
by the dynamic structure and 
presentation of nature in ways 
that are generally unobservable 
on a minuscule level, yet we 
would likely feel a dramatic 
change if these characteristics 
of nature ceased to exist.
While ensuring the presence 
of green space can be the first 
step towards using nature to 

improve 
our 
livelihood, 
it’s 
worth noting that the green 
space must be well kept in 
order to have these 
positive 
influences 
on 
our 
behavior. 
In 
other 
words, 
the 
pleasurable 
and 
therapeutic 
effects that viewing 
nature 
can 
have 
are 
best 
conveyed 
when 
the 
nature 
looks 
natural 
and 
unaffected by man-
made 
destruction. 
A Time Magazine article about 
the psychological effect of green 
spaces mentions Dr. Andrew 
Lee’s 
commentary 
on 
their 
functionality as social spaces: 
“If a green space is difficult to 
get to, has poor lighting or is not 
clean, it may be seen as unsafe 
or inaccessible and probably 
wouldn’t 
boost 
a 
visitor’s 
mood.” With that being said, it’s 
important to let the behaviors 
of diverse and flourishing plant 
life carry on naturally and that 
we minimize drastic alterations 
to allow them to fulfill their 
abstract healing potentials.

Not only can dynamic natural 
spaces be attributed to the health 
of the people who experience it 
every day, but these spaces can 
also be indicative of the health 
of the environment these people 
live in. When the color of an 
area is changed from natural, 
earthy tones to a modern white, 
eccentric slate or abysmal black 
alongside human intervention 
in the area, this more often than 
not suggests the poor quality of 
the environment in this area. 
For instance, a Rice University 
review of marine life in the 
Caribbean comments on the 
importance of the multicolored 
coral reefs for the quality of 
their 
surrounding 
marine 
ecosystem. The varying vibrant 
colors of the coral reefs are able 

to reflect sunlight differently 
to protect them from damage. 
In 
addition, 
their 
colors 
attract 
various 
species 
of 
fish for mating and shield 
them from predators, which 
ultimately contributes to the 
livelihood of all surrounding 
sea life. 
As a result, these coral reefs 
are contributing to the quality 
of their surrounding marine 
environment by allowing the 
many organisms within this 
environment to carry forth 
their every day behaviors that 
contribute to their survival 
and future evolution. In the 
many areas around the world 
that are suffering from coral 
bleaching, the loss of color in 
these natural spaces suggests a 
loss of ability for these spaces 
to provide for the evolution 
of the organisms in them, 
and thus the distress that is 
placed on the quality of these 
environments.
It’s 
also 
important 
to 
realize that almost nothing 
functions as well as it could 
when the parts of the system 
don’t think or act diversely 
and don’t represent different 
functions that ultimately allow 
the multidimensional system 
to perform. It’s not surprising 
that 
some 
connoisseurs 
of 
capitalism 
and 
exploitation 
neglect 
the 
importance 
of 
diversity in nature, just as 
they neglect the importance of 
diversity in people. However, 
it’s imperative to acknowledge 
and act upon the idea that 
diversity in function and in 
representation is essential to 
the progression of mankind. 
While we waste time debating 
if these marginalized groups 
— 
naturally 
and 
socially-
constructed — of our world 
are important enough to care 
about, we are ignoring a slow 
obliteration that is curtailing 
the outcome of their future 
permanently. The expansion 
of diversified characteristics 
is 
inevitably 
beneficial 
for 
our health, the health of our 
environment and the health 
of our society. We shouldn’t 
choose to ignore our ability to 
acknowledge color in its many 
visual and metaphysical forms 
if we have the choice.

Prison reform in America is far overdue
I

n October 2013, The Vera 
Institute of Justice organized 
a tour of prisons in Germany 
and the Netherlands 
with 
the 
intent 
to 
educate 
American 
delegates 
about 
the 
systems of incarceration 
in other countries. The 
condition 
of 
prisons 
in these countries was 
surprising to Americans 
because they were so 
different from our own. 
The guards treated the 
prisoners with dignity 
and respect by talking with them 
out of a genuine interest in what 
they had to say. The policies of 
those prisons also generated a 
culture of independence and 
self-reliance: 
Prisoners 
were 
allowed to make their own meals 
and wear their own clothes. In 
addition, to give prisoners a sense 
of purpose and to prepare them 
for life outside the prison, every 
incarcerated person was required 
to have a job.
Those are practices prisons 
in the United States should seek 
to emulate. The treatment of 
inmates in our detention centers 
is abhorrent. Last year, the 
American Civil Liberties Union 
called three prisoners to testify 
in a federal case against the state 
of Mississippi. The inmates, who 
were held at East Mississippi 
Correctional Facility, described 
horrifying 
sanitary 
conditions 
and decrepit facilities, such as 
plumbing problems so severe that 
fecal matter would come out of 
showerheads in bathrooms and 
drains in cells, and the kitchen 
would be infested with roaches. 
Prisons in the U.S. are also 
severely 
understaffed. 
Every 
position from guards to mental 
health specialists are in short 
supply. In St. Clair Correctional 
Facility, an infamously violent 
prison in Alabama, a mentally ill 
inmate said his monthly check-ups 
were usually only about five to 10 
minutes long. Guards are few and 
far in between, allowing ample 
time for violence and injustice 
to proliferate. Sometimes, to get 
guards’ attention, inmates will 
create emergency situations like 
lighting fires or cutting their 
wrists. 
The lengths to which prisoners 
will go to access a corrections 
officer demonstrate that America 
does not have enough guards 
keeping prisons functional. Since 
prison staff are the sole authority 
over prisoners’ wellbeing, they 
ought to be reasonably accessible, 

but because there are so few of 
them — the South Mississippi 
Correctional Institution has an 
inmate-to-guard 
ratio of 23 to one — 
and 
because 
they 
only respond to the 
most desperate calls 
for 
help, 
inmates 
are largely left to 
deal with problems 
themselves. 
There 
are a few reasons 
why there are so few 
guards. The first is 
that 
most 
people 
simply do not want to work in 
prisons because guards are paid 
low wages for brutal work, like 
breaking up fights. The average 
salary is $44,000 per year, and 
correctional 
officers 
are 
the 
second most likely profession to 
be non-fatally assaulted on the job. 
In addition, many prisons house 
inmates far above their capacity — 
in 2013, more than 17 states were 
holding inmates above capacity. In 
Illinois, for instance, prisons were 
at 151 percent capacity.

Another reason for the harsh 
conditions in prisons stems from 
their design. The belief that all 
criminals must be isolated from 
society has lead to prisons being 
some of the most secluded parts of 
civilization, from their geography 
to their architecture. Prisons are 
often built in remote locations, 
where few people ever travel. 
This is mainly for public safety, 
but it also leads to a startling lack 
of oversight. The most interaction 
many Americans have with prisons 
is passing them on the highway, 
so few people ever see what lies 
beyond the barbed wire fences. 
Even when government agencies 
inspect prisons, they sometimes 
warn prisons in advance of their 
arrival, giving the staff time to 
prepare. This startling lack of 
oversight has to be addressed. By 
instituting policies that would open 
the system up to more scrutiny, we 
can ensure that prison guards do 
not mistreat inmates.
This obviously does not mean 

dangerous, 
violent 
offenders 
should be in close contact with 
the general public. But any 
effective reform would, however, 
entail fundamentally changing 
the structure of detention centers 
to offer inmates more agency 
and 
autonomy, 
thus 
helping 
the incarcerated acclimate to 
conditions similar to those they 
will be released into. That will 
make the transition to life outside 
of prison easier, helping them stay 
out of trouble.
At the center of prison reform 
is ending mass incarceration. 
The morality of unnecessarily 
incarcerating 
people 
aside, 
having fewer people in prisons 
would make the job of prison 
guards easier because they would 
have fewer inmates to watch, and 
it would prevent more violence 
from breaking out.
These changes would not just 
improve the living conditions 
of prisoners, they would make 
the entire corrections system 
far 
more 
effective 
because 
emphasizing 
rehabilitation 
over punishment would bring 
down our recidivism rate, which 
is 
when 
released 
prisoners 
reoffend. Studies demonstrate 
that vocational programs and 
educational 
opportunities 
in 
prisons decrease the likelihood of 
rearrest after release by over 50 
percent. Since the criminal justice 
system 
should 
help 
inmates 
become productive members of 
society, the recidivism rate ought 
to be one of the most telling 
statistics of its success. As such, 
rehabilitation programs should 
be at the forefront of prison 
reform.
The issues in U.S. prisons are 
not just a problem for prisoners, 
they are a reflection of our 
country’s morals. We as a society 
are collectively responsible for 
their treatment, meaning the 
despicable state of corrections 
facilities is a failure on our part. 
As a nation that cherishes liberty, 
we ought to treat the removal of 
our esteemed freedoms with the 
utmost seriousness. We should be 
deeply disturbed at the current 
conditions of those we incarcerate 
and take actions for change. By 
decreasing the incarceration rate, 
increasing the number of guards in 
prisons and investing in education 
and vocational programs, our 
corrections centers can become 
better for inmates, prison staff 
and the country.

“You can never publish my love,” Rogue Wave chants, in the 
song that the title of this series riffs on. Maybe that’s true, and we 
can never quite account for our love on paper or in print, but we 
sure can try. That’s what this series is devoted to: publishing our 
love. Us, the Arts section of The Michigan Daily, talking 
about artists and their work, some of the people and things 
we love the most. Perhaps these are futile approximations 
of love for the poet who told us we deserve to be heard, the 
director who changed the way we see the world, the movie 
with the script we’ve memorized. But who ever said futile 
can’t still be beautiful?
In maybe the most vulnerable stage of my life, I had 
clear, simple mantras. Sometimes I embraced the simple 
truth: “I’ve got some issues that nobody can see / And 
all of these emotions are pouring out of me.” When I was 
hopeful, “One day / This will be my world.” When I was 
hopeless, “All along / I guess I’m meant to be alone.”
My pursuit of happiness was spent in the Cudi zone.
Few artists have had a footprint so large on our current 
era of hip hop, or an influence so quick to manifest — 
other sad rappers began following in his footsteps just 
as soon as he’d paved the path. Kanye West’s 808s & 
Heartbreak is often credited with ushering in an era of 
melancholic songwriting over glamorous production. 
However, A Kid Named Cudi came first — and just as 
it began making waves, West brought in Cudi to give 
creative input on the upcoming 808s. The superstardom 

of artists like Drake and Travis Scott were to follow.
The reason I give Kid Cudi the title “Man On The Moon” is 
to make it clear for whom my love is published. Not the 2013 
Cudi releasing the middling Indicud and disappointing my 
14-year-old self when he put on an appalling performance at my 
first-ever concert. Not the 2015 Cudi tweeting “Poopé Fiasco” 
is a dweeb. Not even the 2018 Kid Cudi co-creating KIDS SEE 
GHOSTS with Kanye West, although I do have unpublished love 

for that collaboration. This is about Cudi of A Kid Named Cudi 
mixtape and Man On The Moon album series fame, hip hop’s 
heartfelt superstar in ’08, ’09 and ’10. Kid Cudi, lord of the sad 
and lonely.
When I was in eighth grade, all was doom and gloom. My 
main schtick was bad posture and having no friends. Instead of 
other people, I made eye contact with my sneakers as I walked 
through school, shoulders hunched, memorizing every crease 
and stain. I look back on that time the same way I look at an 
episode of “South Park”: funny to watch and talk about, but 
alarming when you start to think about it. I’m happy now, all 
smiles and surrounded by good people. Still, there was a time 
when Cudi was the only voice I let in.
As a lover of clever rhymes and writing, I am all about the 
roundabout: I could dissect the dual meaning in lyrics from MF 
DOOM or Del the Funky Homosapien forever. I wasn’t always 
like that, though. Being a troubled teenager struggling to make 

sense of the puzzling social dynamics at play, I wished so badly 
for a presence I could understand, someone to understand me. 
Only Kid Cudi could capture my despair and lay it bare on the 
mic. People confused me. Cudi didn’t. I found comfort in his 
clarity. “They all couldn’t see / The little bit of sadness in me” 
spoke to me so lucidly.
Man On The Moon: The End Of Day and Man On The Moon II: 
The Legend Of Mr. Rager were not critically hailed on release, 
and some of the writing has not aged well. “Dudes who 
critique your clothes are most gay” and “I want to kiss 
you on your space below your navel at / The place that 
you keep neat, so moist, like a towelette” were always 
terrible lines. Even so, much of the lyricism on Man On 
The Moon will remain iconic. The direct lyrics envelop 
an intrinsic loneliness. For me, “I’m trapped in my mind, 
baby / I don’t think I’ll ever get out” resonated with my 
sustained sadness. But “They gon’ judge me anyway / 
So whatever” can also touch someone that’s just going 
through a low moment.
Raw lyrics alone are not the key to Cudi’s charm. 
It’s also the work of the production talent surrounding 
him: Emile, Plain Pat and of course Kanye West (among 
others). The glitzy beats backing his voice are a key 
component in conjuring Cudi’s musical mood. But if 
there were a standout element of his sound to credit for 
becoming hip hop’s hero of sadness, it’s Cudi’s voice. 
His humming has been featured on every Kanye project 
since 808s for good reason: Cudi’s voice is an instrument 
no less powerful than a drum or a synth.
Since I’ve grown older, separated by years from my 
eighth-grade affliction, Cudi fell out of rotation for 
me. Listening to his music brings back frightfully vivid 
memories. Tears staining my pillow every night. Staring at my 
phone wishing anyone would text me. The creases and stains 
of my sneakers over the ugly tile of my middle school hallway. 
The thing about mental illness, though, is that once you’ve 
developed one, it becomes a part of you forever — even when 
it’s dormant, the looming risk of relapse remains. It wasn’t until 
I left for college, and that soul-sucking monolith of depression 
began bearing over me once again, that Cudi would return to 
regular listening. “All along / I guess I’m meant to be alone” hit 
me harder the second time around.
Now, feeling better than ever before but barely a year removed 
from my last low phase, listening to Kid Cudi feels like treading in 
dangerous waters. The electrifying Cudi connection clicks back 
nearly instantaneously when I hear “The Prayer” or “Heaven At 
Nite.” I’ll always have love for the Man On The Moon, gratitude 
for the years keeping me company when nobody else did. I’ve 
just accepted that love might best remain at a healthy distance.

PUBLISH OUR LOVE

The cover of Angel Olsen’s newest record 
All Mirrors defines its mythology well: Olsen 
stares at the viewer intently, against a hazy 
grey background swathed in dark fur. She 
looks like she’s about to speak, but is holding 
her words. There’s something in her eyes, but 
it’s hard to tell quite what it is. It’s like we’re 
looking at her through a movie camera, some 
blurred glass of emotion and context that isn’t 
easy to put a finger on. The music of All Mirrors 
is just as pleasantly evasive — cinematic, 
even. Each song seems like you’ve heard it 
before somewhere, as if it was playing in the 
background all along only to be pulled to the 
forefront of the listener’s mind. The album is 
Olsen at her best, capturing the nostalgia of a 
time in the past, all the while looking forward 
into the future. 
For those familiar with Olsen’s music, it’s 
clear she is already a luminary in the indie 
music scene, merging the traditions of her 
genre with a taste for innovative production 
and arrangements. All Mirrors embodies 
these traits at their highest function, bringing 
everything listeners have always loved about 
her to a new level, one that echoes the chaos 
and confusion of our time. She somehow 
makes the deepest sadness beautiful without 
watering down its importance. Olsen is a 
master of emotion in the purest sense. She 
harnesses the power and vulnerability of 
losing a lover, losing your grip and losing 
your mind with thoughtful deliberation, 
never allowing the listener to bask in their 
preoccupations for too long before turning 
onto another path. 
The two lead singles released ahead of the 
record are perfect examples of this attention 
to detail and mood. “All Mirrors,” the album’s 
title track, is a ballad full of phantasm and 
intensity, one that could easily be hummed in 
the darkness of a listener’s room or screamed 
out of a car on the freeway all the same. That 
duality is what makes Olsen’s music so intense 
in the first place; the fact that it captures the 
power of interiority without bringing it all 
the way outside, instead offering that choice 
to the listener themselves. It’s a reclamation 

of emotion as something more than weakness. 
No, emotion isn’t weakness in Olsen’s hands 
— it’s a tool to wield the utmost strength. In 
her eyes, in her music, feeling is the thing that 
makes us powerful, lets us take control of our 
lives and narratives in a way that plain logic 
never could. 
“Lark,” the other single, captures this 
reclamation in plain terms. The accompanying 
video shows Olsen as she leaves a relationship 
only to walk through the night into the sunset, 
a metaphor for renewal and loss all at once. 
With a hushed tone, the songwriter begins 
with an admittance of hope: “To forget you is 
to hide, there’s still so much left to recover.”
If only we could start again, pretending we 
don’t know each other,” she sings, breaking the 
listener’s heart only to build it up again as she 
breaks out into a loud and triumphant chorus. 
“All we’ve done here is blind one another,” 
Olsen offers to a lover no longer there. It’s 
impossible to get through All Mirrors without 
finding lines like this scattered throughout 
each song, to feel her words reach inside you 
and twist your heart with careful hands. 
Both “Lark” and “All Mirrors” show the 
sharp intensity of Olsen’s capabilities, but she 
is also adept at the softer side of expression, 
as seen in one of the record’s closing tracks, 
“Endgame.” This song follows the rest of 
the album like a sneak attack on the already 
vulnerable listener, soothing them with 
Olsen’s soft and classically beautiful voice 
after the exertion of earlier tracks. “I needed 
more, needed more, from you,” she whispers, 
like a lounge singer in an old movie hidden 
behind curtains. 
You can just imagine her on a stage in a 
velvet gown, the strings of her arrangement 
playing in the background with a hazy glow. 
It’s the cinematic quality of each song that 
makes them so special, like her album cover 
and her approach in general. For Olsen, songs 
are not just songs — with each word, each 
lilting string, each blast of synthesized sound, 
she is creating an encapsulated experience for 
her listener. She doesn’t need to make a movie 
to express what she wants to with her music, 
because each track does it for her. Listening 
to All Mirrors is like watching a million little 
films in your head, as each note, heavy with 
meaning, plays on.

ALBUM REVIEW

There’s a scene early on in the pilot for “Almost 
Family” where Julia Bechley (Brittany Snow, 
“Crazy Ex-Girlfriend”) meets up with some 
random from a dating app. The date isn’t going so 
well. She has to think quick. She just goes for it. She 
tells him she wants to have sex. It works and they 
do. Later on in the episode, she finds out he might 
actually be her brother. 
So, she hooks up with him 
again. That’s kind of all 
you need to know about 
how the pilot went.
The 
premise 
of 
“Almost Family” is both 
serious 
and 
unsettling. 
Overworked 
lawyer 
Edie 
Palmer 
(Megalyn 
Echikunwoke, “House of 
Lies”) is having marriage 
problems. Former child-
athlete 
superstar 
Roxy 
Doyle 
(Emily 
Osment, 
“Young & Hungry”) has anger problems. Julia 
is the ignored assistant to her father, the world-
renowned fertility doctor, Dr. Leon Bechley 
(Timothy Hutton, “Leverage”). But all of those 
problems pale in comparison when it’s discovered 
that Dr. Bechley fathered hundreds of children 
by secretly using his own sperm to impregnate 
patients. At least they should. But somehow they 
don’t, which only makes the basis for “Almost 
Family” that much more disgusting.
Once 
Dr. 
Bechley 
gets 
confronted, 
he 
conveniently has a heart attack and is put in the 
hospital. As her father’s assistant, Julia hands out 
hundreds of DNA test kits to calm the scandal 
down. Edie and Roxy both come in to get one. 
They quickly realize that they’re probably sisters. 
What’s strange is that this isn’t explicitly said, 
but implied. It’s as if the show forgot to confirm 
that the three women are sisters. Which is even 
more bizarre, because that’s half the plot of the 
show. None of the women really engage with this 

information. It isn’t talked about except in one 
scene and is bypassed quickly.
What makes “Almost Family” most difficult to 
watch is that it seems to want to be a character-
driven show. This is a huge problem because the 
premise is so compelling. What Dr. Bechely does is 
so heinous and awful that the characters ought to 
be more furious. But when the news breaks, Julia 
dismisses it as media gossip. Edie is more confused 
than angry when she finds out. Roxy’s parents 
don’t seem to be too concerned about their familial 
situation, 
but 
instead 
hire a lawyer to ensure 
they’ll be compensated. 
The 
characters 
aren’t 
even 
very 
interesting. 
Despite having a talented 
cast, each character feels 
archetypal and flat.
The 
biggest 
problem 
the show runs into is that 
it’s premise is horribly 
revolting. A man violated 
the privacy of hundreds 
of 
women. 
He 
ruined 
families. It’s a very big 
deal. But the show doesn’t seem to want to engage 
with the problem very much. I can’t tell if it 
wants to be a comedy or a drama — or if it’s just 
a very poorly executed dramedy — but the show 
demonstrates a clear lack of consideration given 
the severity of its premise. The way the fertility 
scandal takes a backseat to unfulfilled character 
development makes me question how dedicated the 
show is to its plot. If the show is not committed to 
this plot, they probably shouldn’t be trying it at all.
Each step of the way, “Almost Family” is 
conventional and predictable. Yet it still manages 
to fall short of meeting the most basic expectations. 
It can’t even seem to follow through on the promise 
of its plot. Ultimately, the show is weighed down 
by uninteresting characters and a confused sense 
of self. If the show were more self-aware — or 
even more organized — there may be something 
slavagable here. However, there’s no “almost” about 
any of this. “Almost Family” is most definitely off 
to a confounding and disappointing start.

‘Almost Family’ is banal and
unfulfilling and also strange

6A — Monday, October 7, 2019

Lately I’ve been haunted by Her’s.
The haunting started at second 28 of their Paste Studio’s 
Performance; there’s this seamless moment of chemistry when 
the duo leans forward, synchronizing their body movement. The 
unity of their oscillation is both serious and full of jest. Stephen 
Fitzpatrick takes on a Donald Duck-like nature in his voice 
while Audun Laading (bass) goes for this wicked credit-card-
swipe-move with his head. These dichotomous, “bromantic” 
mannerisms are characteristic of their debut album: Invitation to 
Her’s, a project that dapples in both the real and the fictitious, 
moving from an overtly melodramatic farewell for Fitzpatrick’s 
cat to exploring love and loss through the perspective of made-up 
characters. 
As Daily writer Jonah Mendelson covered in April 2019, Her’s 
died in a car crash while driving to Santa Ana for their North 
American tour. Fitzpatrick was 24, Laading was 25. At this brief 
moment when they drop into the bass line, it felt like they were 
alive. I watched their souls at the control booths of their physical 
bodies as they bop away to the bass — and they’re exuberant. In 
the video, they’re performing the track “What Once Was,” a song 
written in reference to a family member who passed. As these 
spine-chilling lyrics left the space of the screen and soaked into my 
brain, I found myself seeking explanations for the artist instead of 
myself. I can’t help but think they are now what once was instead 
of what is, as if they spoke their own fate into existence.
And so the haunting began. This following has nothing to do 
with ghosts (although the eerie connotations are certainly there). 
Her’s showed up everywhere, refusing to let go of me. 
My roommate and I were dancing in our shabby, compact 
kitchen. We leaned towards each other to bounce with the music. 

She looked up at me, all five feet 
of her, and scrunched her face 
to the bass. We’re a dancey duo, 
bouncing like Her’s did with 
these little idiosyncrasies that 
come alive with the music. The 
dancing continued across the 
kitchen tile and I thought about 
how duos develop and wonder if 
our duo gives, receives, teaches 
and grows just like the duo of 
Her’s did. 
My days seemed touched 
by Her’s. It’s a curious and 
confusing notion, that listeners 
seem 
to 
unite 
in 
phony 
solidarity 
when 
an 
artist’s 
creativity is cut short, only 
listening once an artist has 
died, as if we seek that specific 
post-death obsessing. Attaching to artists like Her’s after their 
death, I feel like everything is liable to higher penalties. Any sort 
of polarization seems to drop away from the comments section. 
Perhaps Her’s now displays a vulnerability in their music that isn’t 
preferential to a certain type of listener. It might be a universal 
woe that they were only permitted a launching pad, and nothing 
more. 
I don’t intend to reconcile the repercussions of Her’s tragedy. 
I don’t know how to do that. But I think by situating music as a 
beseiging of the mind, I suddenly create a creature that has a lot 
to teach me about the persistency, magnetism and unification of 
music. 
The personal, spine-chilling lingering of Her’s jangle pop 
sound took me over, and in doing so it presented lessons for the 

experiential roots of listening. I listened to the bop and it showed 
up, braiding itself into my things, my people, and my objects. And 
we lean into music’s supernatural ability to draw parallels into our 
own realities. That unearthly quality of music showed up while 
dancing in my shitty kitchen, while swinging on the porch with 
my friends, while walking up to my apartment after an awful 
day. And simply put, Her’s ability to hit a bass like Johnny Cash 
and then seamlessly soothe the listener with an Ariel Pink sound 
deserves to be carried and weaved. 
With Invitation to Her’s we were invited to only glimpse Her’s 
potential. But now more than ever, music seems nostalgic and 
nagging, as if Stephen and Audun have invited me to feel music’s 
most gripping traits. October is the month of haunting, so let the 
music creep in.

WHAT I’M LISTENING TO

HEIST OR HIT

Even 20 years after its heyday, the rallying call “junglist 
massive” is sure to raise hell in certain circles. One of the 
main appeals of jungle music is the variety of its appreciators 
(colloquially known as “junglists”) beyond the London youth 
who first championed and created it. From (fictional) Irish 
priests to many more beyond the British Isles, thanks to the 
internet and a brief revival, the manic energy that jungle 
can still conjure today is one of the main reasons behind its 
enduring popularity.
Jungle, like the hundreds of genres all sprouting up in 
the early and mid-1990s in North America and Europe, can 
loosely be traced back to house music, invented by black 
DJs in Chicago in the mid-1980s. Eventually, house jumped 

the pond and grew in popularity in the United Kingdom, 
especially among youth in urban centers such as London and 
Bristol. Already existing in these urban music scenes was 
the influence of Jamaican musicians through the form of 
dub reggae and dancehall. Jungle was the result of natural 
crossovers between the nascent House-influenced scene and 
these existing genres.
While house is characterized by familiar repetitive 4/4 
beats, jungle redefined what it viewed as a rhythmic focus. 
Pioneers of the genre took breakbeats from a variety of 
genres and sped up, chopped and transformed them beyond 
recognition to lay the foundation for the aggressive raves 
where their tracks would be played. Combined with these 
breakbeats was heavily distorted, earth-shaking bass. This 
was a genre made for DJs to play around with at the (mostly 
illegal) raves in which the genre was first introduced to the 
public. And unlike a lot of music from the era, the genre still 
sounds fresh and futuristic, with much room to revive and 
experiment with today. Even fans of Aphex Twin, ostensibly 
someone who makes a widely differing form of music, can 
appreciate and recognize the unpredictable, intoxicating 
percussion of jungle in tracks such as “Flim.” 
Moreover, jungle retains a sort of utopian aspect to it, in that 
it is inseparable from a political ethos of multiracial equality, 
unity and anti-austerity against the Tory (conservative) 
government that held power in the United Kingdom in the 
1990s and today. Ben Murphy of DJ Mag notes, “Jungle, 
though occasionally peppered with funk, reggae and euphoric 
rave samples, tends to be moody and dark … it’s a heads-down 
sound that revels in hypnotic or sometimes fearful vibes.” 
Jungle practitioner Dead Man’s Chest, in the same feature, 
says, “That it should be back at the fore when America is run by 
a bigoted businessman and political uncertainty reigns across 
the globe, propagated by duplicitous governments through 
social media, makes a certain kind of sense.” Jungle at its core 

is a form of rebellion against the divisive, harmful politics 
that the Trumps and Boris Johnsons of the world peddle 
against the increasingly multiracial societies their countries 
have been and are becoming. Part of the genre’s decline in 
popularity was its dogged refusal to become commercialized 
and to be used in peddling advertisements. 
Even though jungle is long past its prime, its influence 
has reached far and wide. The even more chaotic energy of 
drum and bass comes out of the original jungle sounds, not 
to mention the early works of grime pioneers such as Dizzee 
Rascal and Wiley as well as more modern practitioners such as 
Skepta, who have gained worldwide notoriety. Encouragingly, 
small revivals have been popping out. Producers who never 
actually lived through the scene are trying their hand at 
making jungle, and younger DJs are themselves introducing 
the classics into their own sets, proving the timeless nature of 
the genre as well as its uniting power.

Part of the genre’s decline 
in popularity was its 
dogged refusal to become 
commercialized and to be used 
in peddling advertisements

The University of Michigan School of Music, Theater & Dance’s Jazz 
Showcase by undergraduate and graduate jazz music students was 
presented at Hankinson Hall in the Moore building Thursday night. 
I was blown away. I was absolutely elevated to a more professional 
level of artistry than I have ever experienced at this University. 
(Actually, seeing Audra MacDonald at Hill Auditorium was the very 
top, but these students gave her a run for her money.) 
When I asked trumpet player/vocalist Ben Green from the 
band Sabbatical Bob why these showcases are so important at the 
University, he said the showcase “gives people perspective on where 
90 percent of pop music they listen to is coming from. America’s entire 
music tradition is built on Black music, and ... that’s super important. 
Like what we were playing, the funk music and the big band music, 
everything we were playing tonight, it all stems from Black music.”
Upon walking in, I was greeted with big band number “Without 
A Song,” with lyrics by William Rose and Edward Eliscu and music 
by Vincent Youmans and arranged by Rick Stitzel. My attention was 
immediately transfixed on the conductor; faculty member Ellen Rowe. 
Her back turned to the audience, Rowe reminded me of Edna Mode 
from Pixar movie “The Incredibles,” with her petite yet fiery frame 
commanding the Jazz Ensemble to an unmatched vibrancy. 
This was immediately followed 
by a performance of “Old Folks,” 
with lyrics written by Dedette Lee 
Hill and music by Willard Robison. 
The song, performed by music 
faculty members Ellen Rowe on 
piano and Dennis Wilson on a 
bluesy trombone, demonstrated 
a simple sense of humor and 
confident mastery of the artists’ 
craft. 
Original 
composition 
“Milkshake Boy Est Mort” by 
senior 
Mohan 
Ritsema 
was 
the 
most 
traditionally 
“jazz” 
composition, and it was really 
intriguing to see a brand new piece 

of music on its feet for the first time. I’m excited to see how it evolves. 
The most enthralling performance of the evening had to be Horace 
Tapscott’s “To the Great House” with graduate jazz student Zekkereya 
El-magharbel leading the piece on trombone. Even counting my time 
in jazz clubs in New York City, I have never witnessed a performance 
quite like his.
El-magharbel played the trombone like it was a true extension of his 
body, like he was giving his entire human will to perform with; to say 
I’m eager to see where he goes next is an understatement. He elevated 
the room, and fellow jazz students also performing the number around 
him were lifted up due to his professional artistry which provided an 
all around fabulous performance. 
Another standout was a bluegrass number titled “As Yet Untitled” 
written by Grant Flick and performed by jazz students Grant Flick 
on violin and Matt Davis on banjo. The complexity of the music and 
upbeat nature of bluegrass which I have only heard before in Nashville 
gave great variety to the show. 
“There’s something special about U-M, especially, that doesn’t really 
hold true in other places. You’ve got a funk band, a bluegrass band, a 
Bill Evans style piano trio, and a free improv group all in one set,” Cole 
Abod, a senior studying Jazz piano, said.
The final numbers of the night were performed by funk band 
Sabbatical Bob. Jazz was originally my uncle’s favorite musical 
medium that he passed down to me, and he has since passed away. 
The majority of my childhood was spent following him in and out of 
jazz clubs near his home of New 
York City. When I met Ben Green 
of band Sabbatical Bob, it felt like 
a wink from the universe that the 
University’s Jazz ensemble is a 
program to be remembered.
The name Sabbatical Bob came 
out of “the spirit of Bob (Jazz 
faculty member and acclaimed 
bassist Bob Hurst) on sabbatical.” 
Originally a band primarily playing 
small gigs and house parties, 
Sabbatical Bob are now performing 
at venues like The Blind Pig and 
Ziggy’s (their next show is there on 
Nov. 22) in Ypsi and have music on 
all streaming platforms.

 Jim Harbaugh felt no need to wait 

for questions.

Walking into the press room Saturday 

afternoon, he had a “special guest” 

beside him and a message to deliver.

The “special guest” was junior 

cornerback Ambry Thomas, a man who 

he introduced with a few laudatory 

sentences. The message didn’t need any 

introduction.

“Obviously, that was a defensive 

masterpiece,” 
Harbaugh 
said, 
still 

adjusting his seat at the podium.

As 
Harbaugh 
ran 
down 
the 

masterpiece’s exemplars — Don Brown’s 

game plan, the pass rush, the run 

defense, the secondary — his confidence 

in Michigan’s defense emanated.

And after dispatching No. 14 Iowa 

in a 10-3 slugfest that moved the 

19th-ranked Wolverines to 4-1 overall 

and 2-1 in Big Ten play, it’s easy to see 

where the confidence comes from.

All week, the Hawkeyes were lauded 

as a replica of the Wisconsin team that 

routed Michigan, 35-14, two weeks 

ago. That game prompted wholesale 

dismissal of the Wolverines’ once-

vaunted defense. Michigan’s response: 

not so fast.

“Don called a great game, they were 

very well prepared,” Harbaugh said. 

“And player-wise, it was just obvious 

from play one to the last play of the 

game that everybody was hustling and 

running and playing with great effort.”

Brown’s challenge to his defense 

in this prove-it week was to intercept 

Iowa 
quarterback 
Nate 
Stanley 

twice. Through four weeks, Stanley 

had been among the best statistical 

quarterbacks in college football, with 

eight touchdowns and no interceptions.

He finished Saturday with three.

“They’re not really comfortable 

passing the ball, they’re not really a 

spread team or anything like that,” said 

senior linebacker Khaleke Hudson. 

“So (it was) just stopping the run and 

doing whatever we can for them to be 

uncomfortable.”

Beneath 
Stanley’s 
stats, 
the 

Wolverines knew he couldn’t carry their 

offense without an efficient ground 

game. So Brown’s preparation focused 

on the run, snuffing out the Hawkeye’s 

ISO and power schemes in a way that 

Michigan’s defense failed to against 

the Badgers’ counter-heavy scheme in 

Madison.

“Don, during the week, he said he 

might jump off a tall building if some 

of those (ISO) plays worked cause 

they really thought they had them,” 

Harbaugh said.

Rooftops around Ann Arbor, consider 

yourselves safe. Iowa’s final rushing 

totals: 30 carries, one yard.

“We knew it’s the power Iowa, the big 

dogs who just run it down your throat,” 

said sophomore defensive end Aidan 

Hutchinson. “So we showed them what 

kind of run defense we have.”

Michigan needed every part of its 

defense’s dominance.

Early on, it looked as if the offense 

might be able to follow up its 52-point 

showing against Rutgers with a repeat 

against an opponent with a pulse. After 

an early field goal off a fumble recovery, 

Shea Patterson led off the next drive 

with a 51-yard post route to Nico Collins, 

showcasing the downfield passing 

ability that has only fleetingly popped 

its head above water all season.

Five plays later, freshman running 

back Zach Charbonnet ran for his fourth 

touchdown of the year.

That was with 8:33 to play in the first 

quarter. Michigan didn’t score again.

“Sometimes, it’s gonna be like 

that,” Patterson said. “We were really 

fortunate that the defense came out and 

played the way they did, kept us in the 

game the entire time. … We left a lot out 

there. Gotta start finishing in the red 

zone.”

Yet, among it all, the Wolverines kept 

their advantage on the scoreboard.

For that, they had their defense 

to thank. Each time Iowa entered 

Michigan territory, it was stymied on 

the edge of field goal range. Sometimes 

it came as a result of their own undoing, 

with penalties and questionable play-

calling. At others, it was an unavoidable 

consequence of the Wolverines’ eight 

sacks against an offensive line that 

was touted as a poor man’s version of 

Wisconsin’s. Poor indeed.

“I’m not gonna lie, it felt pretty 

smooth on the field,” Hutchinson said. 

“It felt like everyone was doing their 

thing.”

Still, kept afloat by Michigan’s 

anemic offense, the Hawkeyes had one 

final chance, taking over at their own 

43 with 1:35 to play. After a fourth-

down conversion on the first set of 

downs paved the way for three straight 

incompletions, Brown dialed up a blitz 

on fourth-and-10 with the game on the 

line.

In the huddle, Hutchinson knew it 

was going to work as soon as he heard 

the playcall. Hudson was just excited for 

his shot at the quarterback.

Seconds later, that’s exactly what he 

got, storming Stanley and forcing an 

emergency left-handed dump off that 

amounted to a hope and a prayer.

The answer: Not today.

W

hen I walked into 
U-M Soccer Sta-
dium 45 minutes 
before the first game on Sunday, 
nobody was in the stands yet 
but “Dancing Queen” blared 
over the speakers. So, I guess 
there were never any plans to be 
subtle.
That’s 
somehow 
both fitting 
and ironic, 
and it can fill 
both boxes 
because the 
Venn Dia-
gram of gays 
and sports is 
usually just 
two circles 
bumping up against each other. 
It’s fitting because it’s Pride 
Day here, for the first time 
ever, and we aren’t exactly shy 
about things like this. It’s ironic 
because we’re at a sporting 
event and athletes still swing 
heavily towards a muted, non-
emotive way of carrying them-
selves. It’s still abjectly weird 
to break that mold, especially 
in the way LGBTQ folks stereo-
typically break it. 
That’s why there are exceed-
ingly few openly gay athletes in 
collegiate or professional sports. 
It’s why those who come out 
stress for years about it, and it’s 
why I spent the first 20 minutes 
after I got there thinking about 
the social dynamics of playing 
“Dancing Queen” while some 
soccer players warmed up.
There’s a deep-seated ele-
ment of self-consciousness I 
still have about things like this. 
It’s not as bad as it was in high 
school, but it lingers now as my 
head goes in circles about this 
song. Nathan Brechd, the man 
who organized this day, seems 
to have shaken that element of 
himself a while ago. When I 
asked where to find him before 
the game, I was told by someone 
in the press box, “He’s the tall 
guy dancing near the table with 

the Pride flag.”
It turns out that Brechd is not 
gay himself, but an ally. That’s 
somewhat beside the point. If 
you’re working in sports and 
dancing around with a Pride 
flag, your level of unease with 
breaking norms is below zero.
Brechd started research-
ing last spring about whether 
other Big Ten teams had done 
something like a Pride Day, 
and the conversations started 
to heat up about three months 
ago. Sometime in between, the 
Athletic Department heard 
from the Department of Equity 
and Inclusion that some student 
athletes had asked about doing 
a pride day in an anonymous 
survey.
Soccer — especially women’s 
soccer — has natural ties to the 
LGBTQ community, so it made 
sense to do it here. Brechd went 
on Maize Pages and reached 
out to every LGBTQ-affiliated 
group he could find.
“I just wanted to be as 
authentic as possible,” Brechd 
said. “I didn’t want this to be a 
day that members of the LGBTQ 
community came out to and felt 
like we were being gimmicky or 
inauthentic.”
They hung pride flags of 
various LGBTQ groups over the 
press box, gave away rainbow 
flags to fans in attendance, and 
set up face paint and chalk. At 
halftime, they 
played a video 
highlighting 
the Athletic 
Department’s 
inclusivity. It all 
felt somewhat 
understated and 
quaint, but in a 
comforting way.
“I think it’s 
pretty great,” 
said Cyvvie 
Barton. She was in the stands 
with her partner, Laurel Hanna. 
“There are a lot of kids here. 
A lot of families here, which is 
cool. I haven’t been to a soccer 

game before, so I don’t know 
if the crowd compares or if it’s 
bigger or smaller than it usu-
ally is.”
Both of them work at the 
University, for DEI. They heard 
about the event on social media 
and came any-
way, sitting 
with a pride flag 
draped between 
them.
I explained 
to them that I 
wasn’t quite sure 
how to write 
this story, how 
much I wanted 
to talk about my 
experience as a 
gay man and that I didn’t really 
know how to navigate these 
waters. Truthfully, I was hoping 
they’d help me find some coher-
ence to this story, but as you’ve 

figured out by now, that didn’t 
quite happen.
“We were just talking about 
how many Pride events that 
we’ve been to this summer and 
stuff like that, so this is kind of 
like a great cherry on top of the 
year,” Barton said. “But yeah, I 
think women’s sports in general 
are more open to people being 
different than the standard. So 
LGBT initiatives kind of fit well 
into that narrative, I guess. Or 
people in general. 
“Whereas I think in a lot of 
men’s sports, especially profes-
sional sports, it’s not good to 
be different unless you’re the 
best person on the field. So it’s a 
little easier in some ways with 
women’s sports.”
She was surprised that Pride 
Day wasn’t just for the women’s 
team. Neither of them saw men’s 
sports as being particularly wel-

coming to LGBT communities 
because, empty rhetoric aside, 
they’re not. That’s not meant to 
imply that there aren’t people 
trying to fix the problem or say 
that there hasn’t been marked 
progress being made. It’s not 
meant as a dra-
matic statement 
either. It’s just 
a fact.
That shows 
itself in big ways 
— there’s no 
hiding the fact 
that through-
out the four 
major profes-
sional leagues in 
America, there 
somehow isn’t a single openly 
gay man — and small ones, too. 
When the men’s soccer team 
took the field for warmups on 
Sunday, rap music played. 

Nitpicking things like that 
belies the point, though. Some 
people like to dump on any 
progress that isn’t both whole-
sale and done in completely 
their way, going out of their 
way to find reasons things are 
still bad or will 
never be good. 
I hate those 
people, because 
underscoring all 
of those issues, 
however big, is an 
undercurrent of 
progress.
On Sunday, 
thanks to Brechd, 
Michigan took 
a small step for-
ward.

SportsMonday Column: Why Pride Day matters

The minute-long review of 
Johnny Beecher’s power-play 
goal was the only thing that 
caused doubt at Yost Ice Arena 
on Sunday afternoon.
The 
freshman 
forward 
appeared to have kicked the puck 
into the net, but upon review, 
the referees determined that 
the contact with his foot was 
unintentional and Michigan was 
awarded the goal.
The tally gave the Wolverines 
a 2-0 lead over Windsor heading 
into the first intermission, and 
the game didn’t get much closer 
from there. Michigan poured in 
six more scores to win, 8-2, in its 
season-opening exhibition.
All the usual caveats about 
this being an exhibition game 
against a team in a lower division 
apply, but the Wolverines showed 
flashes of the team they could be 
this year.
From the opening moments 
of the game, it was clear that 
one team had an advantage. 
Michigan 
didn’t 
allow 
the 
Lancers into the offensive zone 
for the first three minutes, and 
Windsor finished the first period 
with just three shots, all of which 
sophomore goaltender Strauss 
Mann stopped. 
“I thought there was a lot of 
good things that came out of that 
game, and that’s what we look for 
out of one of those games,” said 
senior forward Will Lockwood. 
“We kind of looked at it like it 
was a regular season game, so 
we came out hot. We didn’t score 
right off the bat, but pucks started 
to go in. I think we let off the gas 
a little bit which is what we want 
to focus on not doing, but overall, 
I thought it was good.”
Sophomore forward Garrett 
Van Wyhe opened the scoring 
on a tipped pass from senior 
defenseman Luke Martin, and 
Michigan didn’t look back from 
then on out. Beecher’s power-
play score left the Lancers in a 
2-0 hole to close the opening 
stanza, 
and 
the 
Wolverines 
picked up where they left off in 

the second.
Freshman defenseman Cam 
York lit the lamp for his first of 
two times on the afternoon when 
sophomore 
defenseman 
Nick 
Blankenburg fired a shot from 
the top of the right circle that 
caught York’s stick and snuck 
behind 
goaltender 
Jonathan 
Reinhart. 
Minutes 
later, 
freshman defenseman Keaton 
Pehrson unleashed a slapshot 
from the left circle that Reinhart 
didn’t have a chance of stopping.
“I 
liked 
our 
freshmen, 
especially our two defensemen,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Mel 
Pearson. “You can see that 
they’re both good defensemen. 
We’ve really got some potential 
on offense with them.”
By the time Windsor got on 
the scoreboard, the hole had 
already been dug. After York 
went down behind the net, 
forward Mel Melconian picked 
up the puck and passed it to 
teammate Ryan Shaw. Shaw’s 
shot went over senior goaltender 
Hayden Lavigne’s right shoulder 
for the Lancers’ first tally of the 
night, but Michigan still led by 
three.
Michigan quickly extended 
the lead once again in the closing 
minutes of the second period on 
a highlight-reel backhander from 
York and another power-play 
tally, this time from sophomore 
forward Jimmy Lambert.
Lambert’s power-play goal 
was the second of three for 
the Wolverines — out of six 
opportunities. 
Pearson 
made 
some changes to the power play 
this offseason, giving associate 
head coach Bill Muckalt the reins 
of the unit.
“You have systems but then 
you have to have players that can 
just read off of that,” Pearson 
said. “Not everything’s going 
to go tic tac toe, so you have to 
take what they give you and then 
create some things offensively. 
And I thought we didn’t score on 
some of our best chances on the 
power play, but it looked good.”
The biggest question mark 
of the night was Lavigne, who 
allowed two goals on 14 shots 

for a save percentage of .857. 
Lavigne entered last season with 
the starting job, but he quickly 
started splitting time with Mann, 
as was the case Sunday. Mann 
faced fewer shots than Lavigne, 
but the second goal Lavigne 
allowed came on a play where he 
didn’t get his pad across in time 
to make what could’ve been a 
straightforward save.
“(Lavigne) was good,” Pearson 
said. “He made some tough saves. 
You know, I’m sure he’d like the 
second one back but when you 
haven’t played for a long time, 
it’s just a fluky thing. He made 
some real hard saves. I liked 
his alertness. I liked the way he 
moved the puck. I thought he 
was good, too.”
Coming 
into 
Sunday’s 
exhibition, 
Michigan 
wasn’t 
worried about getting the win. 
It was almost expected, and the 
biggest things Pearson hoped 
to learn were about this team’s 
potential.
After putting up eight goals 
on a goaltender with a career 
save percentage above .900 and 
allowing just two, the Wolverines 
look poised for a better year 
than last year. It was only an 
exhibition, but the pieces seem to 
be there for a strong season.

When it comes to college 
athletics, 
no 
matter 
how 
talented a recruit is, there is 
always uncertainty as to how 
well the skills will translate.
The Michigan hockey team 
was no stranger to that this 
preseason. 
The 
Wolverines 
brought in a freshman class of 
five — including first-round 
NHL draft picks in defenseman 
Cam York and forward Johnny 
Beecher — hoping to find some 
key contributors.
It takes more than one game 
to rid uncertainty. Regardless, 
Sunday’s exhibition win against 
Windsor shed some light on 
what the underclassman can 
bring to the program. 
York, 
Beecher 
and 
defenseman Keaton Pehrson 
were the three freshmen who 
saw the ice in Sunday’s 8-2 
victory — with forwards Eric 
Ciccolini and Nick Granowicz 
ruled healthy scratches — and 
all three notched tallies on the 
box score.
Of the three, York’s presence 
shined brightest. Six minutes 
into the second period, he 
received a quick pass near the 

left circle and delivered the 
puck past Lancer goaltender 
Jonathan Reinhart. That goal 
marked the first of his college 
career — one he’s thought about 
for a while.
“I’ve 
been 
dreaming 
of 
playing out there for a long 
time,” York said. “Just to have 
that opportunity to put it in 
the back of the net was a dream 
come true.”
Less than 10 minutes later, 
York was back in the spotlight. 
This time, though, he flashed 
more showmanship. Streaking 
down the right wing, York 
collected the puck and moved it 
through his legs with a creative 
ease before scoring his second 
goal of the night.
“In practice every now and 
then, I’ll get a pass that’s a little 
bit behind me and I’ll do that,” 
York said. “It’s just kind of an 
‘in the moment’ type of thing. 
It worked out, so that’s pretty 
cool.”
Though 
Beecher 
and 
Pehrson didn’t show quite as 
much craft, they still made 
their names heard. In the 
final minute of the opening 
frame, Beecher strategically 
positioned himself in front of 
the crease, and a deflection 

off his foot led to Michigan’s 
second goal.
With all the energy and 
emotions built up leading into 
their first game, the Wolverines 
scrapped with opposing players 
after whistles were blown, a 
few times. Beecher got in the 
action at one point, after taking 
a hit near the boards. Though 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
hopes for more discipline out 
of those situations, the play 
proved Beecher is not afraid to 
get involved.
“Johnny got hit up high, but, 
again, you have to be able to 
take that,” Pearson said. “You 
have to turn the cheek and play 
hard and let the referees call the 
game. It’s a physical game and a 
physical sport and sometimes 
you don’t like getting bounced 
around a little bit, but you 
have to understand, we have 
to control that. Johnny’s a big 
strong guy, so he can handle 
himself. He’ll be fine.”
Pehrson had his moment 
in the middle of the second 
frame. 
Sophomore 
forward 
Luke Morgan sent the puck his 
way from the right to left circle, 
and Pehrson showed off his 
strength, rifling the puck past 
Reinhart.
The Lancers aren’t at the 
caliber of opponents Michigan 
will face here on out. They 
normally 
don’t 
compete 
in 
the NCAA, so it was easy for 
Pearson to give the newcomers 
substantial ice time. That said, 
he was pleased with their 
performances and is keen on 
keeping the freshmen involved. 
And if their adjustment to 
the college game continues 
to go smoothly, it could pay 
dividends moving forward.
“I’m not surprised they’ve 
got the skill, it’s just a matter 
of learning what it takes every 
night and how hard you have 
to play and how much quicker 
the pace is and stronger. And 
it’ll even go up a notch or two 
from tonight to the next game,” 
Pearson said. “But like I said, 
they’re good hockey players 
and you could tell that tonight.”

Michigan’s OL and what could have been

As 
Michigan’s 
offense 
stalled to a halt on Saturday, 
prompting worry and disbelief 
from everyone except coach Jim 
Harbaugh, one area emerged 
without widespread critique — 
the offensive line. 
Shea Patterson was sacked just 
twice, and any pressure on him 
usually felt like a result of his 
standing in the pocket too long. 
Michigan’s run game vacillated 
between solid and slightly below-
average with 3.6 yards per carry. 
On the few drives where the 
Wolverines moved the ball, the 
line got a noticeable push. AJ 
Epenesa, the Hawkeyes’ stud 
edge rusher, had a relatively quiet 
day, with two tackles — albeit a 
sack and a TFL.
All of this is to say that the 
line wasn’t much of a story in 
Michigan’s 10-3 win over Iowa. It 
played just fine — a line that has 
held firm for most of the year. It 
did for most of last year, too. An 
area that, during a week one loss 
at Notre Dame in 2018, seemed 
poised to halt any progress the 
Wolverines had made, is now the 
least of anybody’s concerns.
Saturday was an apt time to 
think about this, because an 
alternate history came with it. 
Alaric Jackson, a 6-foot-6 junior 
from Detroit, lined up in an Iowa 
uniform. Jackson will be in the 
NFL one day — if not next year, 
then in 2021. If Michigan’s line 
hadn’t figured itself out in the last 
year, he might have been standing 
there on the sideline Saturday as 
one of the most glaring recruiting 
misses of the Harbaugh era.
As 2016’s recruiting cycle came 
down to the wire, Harbaugh had 
Devery Hamilton, a four-star 
tackle from Baltimore, signed, 
sealed and delivered. He was 
supposed to be the next big thing. 
Then he got into Stanford late in 
the process.
Hamilton flipped. Michigan, 
suddenly, was left with a spot to 
fill. “It looked like a need,” Steve 

Lorenz, a recruiting analyst for 
247Sports, said this week.
Jackson was local and well-
regarded, a high-level 3-star 
prospect. Michigan kept an eye 
on him in case this scenario came 
to pass, though it hadn’t extended 
an offer. That’s the luxury of being 
the biggest program recruiting a 
kid in-state. Jackson would have 
gone to Michigan with an offer, 
and Michigan knew it.
After 
Hamilton 
flipped, 
Michigan offered Jackson. Then, 
at the last second before signing 
day, the Wolverines pulled the 
offer.
“It’s still up to (Michigan),” 
Lorenz said. “They still have to 
send the letter in for him to be 
able to sign with them. 
“... I suspect it was much 
more of a numbers type thing 
(than Jackson’s ability). Not that 
they were full, necessarily, but 
sometimes the decision is, do we 
bank a scholarship for next cycle 
or do we take this guy? And there 
were a couple (players) at a couple 
different positions that Michigan 
did not send a letter to that same 
day.”
There’s nothing particularly 
untoward 
about 
Michigan’s 
behavior. The Wolverines likely 

told Jackson of the situation 
ahead of time, knowing he had 
an Iowa offer in his back pocket. 
It comes down to the reality of 
recruiting, and the reality of 
where Michigan thought it was at 
that point — in the second year of 
the Harbaugh era and ascending.
Judging by the next class when 
it signed, you wouldn’t have 
batted an eye at the decision. On 
the line, it featured center Cesar 
Ruiz, tackles Andrew Stueber 
and JaRaymond Hall and guards 
Joel 
Honigford 
and 
Chuck 
Filiaga — all highly-touted. Of 
that group, only Ruiz starts now. 
Stueber got hurt before this 
season. Filiaga and Honigford 
are backups, though there still is 
a notable optimism around the 
former. Hall is no longer with the 
program. 
On the first day of the 2017 
season, Michigan started a group 
that lacked in experience. It didn’t 
go well. The Wolverines finished 
that season 117th in adjusted sack 
rate, and the problems seemed to 
carry over into the 2018 opener 
against the Fighting Irish.
It’s easy to imagine a scenario 
where Jackson grabs a starting 
tackle job from Jon Runyan Jr. or 
Juwann Bushell-Beatty after that 

game, then runs with it. It’s easy 
to imagine he does so before then.
“You 
go 
across 
the line, 
Runyan’s (class of ) ‘16, Bredeson’s 
‘16, Ruiz is ‘17, Big Mike (Onwenu) 
is ‘16 and then Mayfield is ‘18, 
right?” Lorenz said. “So, you look 
at that, it’s hard not to imagine 
Jackson wouldn’t be one of the 
starting tackles right now.”
Instead of Jackson starting, 
Runyan flipped a switch and 
turned himself into one of the 
most dependable tackles in the 
conference. 
Bushell-Beatty 
had a fine senior year and now, 
Mayfield seems to be a long-term 
starter.
On Saturday, Mayfield sat at 
a Crisler Center podium taking 
questions following Harbaugh 
who, minutes earlier, went out of 
his way to highlight the line.
“I thought our offensive line 
played really good. Played really 
physical,” Harbaugh said. “And 
played against some really good 
players, too. They got some 
really — they got guys who can 
put pressure on the quarterback. 
That showed up a few times.”
So, hypotheticals, what-ifs and 
future NFL tackles passed over 
aside, Michigan is pretty happy 
with what it has.

ALEXANDRIA POMPEI/Daily
Michigan’s offenive line continued its consistent play, allowing just two sacks against Iowa on Saturday afternoon.

‘M’ cruises over ‘Cats

Persistence pays off.
It’s an old adage that constantly 
finds modern applications.
The Michigan men’s soccer 
team (5-2-3 overall, 2-0-2 Big Ten) 
found the truth of that on Sunday 
as it beat Northwestern (5-5-1, 1-2-
1) by a score of 3-0.
The game got off to a slow start, 
but picked up in intensity in the 
second half. Both teams struggled 
to create scoring opportunities in 
the first half, and failed to turn 
any of the sparse chances into 
goals.
The best opportunity of the 
first half came in the 23rd minute, 
when 
Wildcat 
goalie 
Miha 
Miskovic came out to clear a long 
throw by junior defender Austin 
Sweich but was beaten to the ball 
by fifth-year forward Nebojsa 
Popovich. But Popovich’s header 
harmlessly struck the crossbar 
with the open goal gaping.
The Wolverines began to ramp 
up the pressure in the second half, 
coming out of the locker room on 
the front foot and staying there 
throughout the rest of the game.
Nine minutes into the second 
half, junior defender Jackson 
Ragen headed a corner from 
senior forward Jack Hallahan 
back across the goal to the near 
post, where it was smashed home 
by junior midfielder Carlos Tellez 
to break the deadlock. Three 
minutes later, junior defender Joel 
Harrison played in Tellez through 
the right hand side, but Tellez’s 
chip past the goalie drifted just 
wide.
Tellez 
had 
a 
breakout 
game off the bench, playing a 
very influential role after his 
introduction in the middle of 
the first half. His high work rate 
and ability to read the game kept 
Northwestern pinned back for 
all of the second half and kept 
chance after chance coming for 
Michigan.
“(I’m) doing everything for 
the team, whatever role that 

takes,” Tellez said. “Whether it’s 
starting, coming off the bench, 
coach knows I am always there 
for whatever role needs to be 
played. So I am just happy to come 
off the bench and help the team in 
whatever way I can.”
The Wolverines doubled their 
tally with 33 minutes left in the 
game after a fantastic driving run 
by Popovic with the ball, where 
he drifted past several defenders 
before unleashing a shot into the 
top left corner.
A 
beautiful 
give-and-go 
between sophomore midfielder 
Kevin Buca and Tellez with 13 
minutes left allowed Buca to put 
a cross in to the far post, where 
senior midfielder Umar Farouk 
Osman was waiting unmarked. 
Osman calmly settled the ball 
and slotted it past the charging 
Miskovic 
and 
into 
the 
net, 
increasing the lead to three and 
effectively sealing the game for 
the Wolverines.
Hallahan 
was 
his 
usual 
influential 
self, 
continually 
providing a threat to score. He 
had two assists on the night, 
and 
proved 
instrumental 
as 
a 
playmaker 
and 
facilitator 
throughout.
“Jack is a difference maker 
… he’s a special player … most 
importantly, he’s a great team 
guy,” said Michigan coach Chaka 
Daley. “He really is a selfless 
player who works hard for the 
team.”
The defense held strong again, 
limiting Northwestern to just 
six shots and recording its third 
consecutive clean sheet. Ragen 
led the way with a stout defensive 
performance, 
and 
senior 
goalkeeper Andrew Verdi had a 
good game as well. 
“Our first half performance 
was pretty solid,” Daley said. 
“Defensively, we gave our team a 
chance to win the game and that 
just stayed contagious throughout 
the game. The first goal … created 
confidence within the group for 
all the positive soccer that we 
were going in the right direction.”

MEN’S SOCCER

Wolverines’ pass rush proves worth

Early this week, Don Brown 
offered his defense a challenge.
Iowa 
quarterback 
Nate 
Stanley 
had 
thrown 
eight 
touchdowns 
and 
zero 
interceptions on the season. 
The 
Michigan 
defensive 
coordinator told his guys to try 
for at least two picks.
But 
when 
sophomore 
defensive 
end 
Aidan 
Hutchinson dug into the film, 
he noticed something else: 
Stanley rarely got hit. With 
ample time in the pocket, of 
course his throws were clean. 
So Hutchinson and the rest of 
the pass rush vowed to pressure 
Stanley and force him to make 
plays.
Eight 
sacks, 
three 
interceptions 
and 
a 
10-3 
Wolverines win later, it was 
clear: Stanley failed the test.
“After today, we smacked 
him,” Hutchinson said. “And 
that showed what happens 
when you apply 
pressure on that 
guy.”
In 
a 
game 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh called 
a 
“defensive 
masterpiece,” 
it 
was 
the 
Wolverines’ 
vaunted 
pass 
rush 
that 
provided 
the 
most 
luster. 
Brown frequently called blitz 
packages, and no matter who 
was tabbed with chasing down 
Stanley, they got to him.
Five 
different 
players 
— 
Hutchinson, junior defensive 
end 
Kwity 
Paye, 
fifth-year 
senior 
linebacker 
Jordan 
Glasgow, sophomore linebacker 
Cam McGrone and fifth-year 
senior defensive end Michael 
Danna — had at least one sack. 
Michigan’s eight sacks were 
not only the most in one game 
since 2016, they were more than 
Stanley had been sacked in the 
Hawkeyes’ previous four games 
combined.
Brown knew that Iowa was 

a bruising, run-it-down-your-
throat type of team. He saw 
how much the Wolverines had 
struggled against a similar style 
against Wisconsin two weeks 
ago. But the Hawkeyes didn’t 
have 
a 
Heisman-candidate 
running back like Jonathan 
Taylor, so Brown predicated 
his game plan on one thing: 
stopping the run.
And as senior viper Khaleke 
Hudson put it, “the results 
talked for themselves.” Iowa 
finished 
the 
game 
with 
one 
rushing 
yard. Michigan 
forced Stanley 
to 
pass, 
and 
when 
he 
dropped back, 
the Wolverines 
brought 
the 
blitz. 
They 
constantly 
forced 
the 
Hawkeyes 
into 
third-and-
long situations, making Iowa’s 
offense as one-dimensional as 
the Badgers made Michigan’s.
“They’re 
not 
really 
comfortable passing the ball,” 
Hudson 
said. 
“They’re 
not 
really a spread team or anything 
like that. So just stopping the 
run and doing whatever we can 
for them to be uncomfortable.”
Iowa was so uncomfortable 
that, in an effort to stop 
the 
Wolverines’ 
rush, 
they 
committed 
two 
consecutive 
holding penalties on one drive 
in the fourth quarter. That, 
combined with a false start, set 
up third-and-19 at Michigan’s 
39 — at which point Stanley was 

unceremoniously sacked again.
“That’s 
huge,” 
Harbaugh 
said. “That’s how you get the 
one yard rushing, when you 
can get those big plays, those 
big tackles for losses and sacks. 
Brought a lot of pressure, plus 
it led to a lot of penalties. Our 
guys were getting held quite a 
bit and that showed up in the 
game.”
The Hawkeyes had one last 
shot to win the game in the 
fourth quarter. They drove into 
Michigan’s territory with the 
clock winding down, and on 
fourth-and-10, Stanley dropped 
back. The Wolverines brought 
the blitz. Some tried to strip the 
ball out while others aimed to 
bring Stanley down.
Somehow, Stanley escaped, 
throwing the ball with his left 
hand to an open receiver who 
seemed to have lots of space 
in front of him. But Michigan 
still stopped the play for a loss, 
mostly due to the pass rush 
pushing Stanley back so far 
even a catch had little chance. 
Then, the offense kneeled out 
the clock for a win.
“Everybody 
had 
to 
do 
their 
jobs, 
stick 
to 
their 
assignments,” Danna said. “We 
didn’t need any Supermans or 
any superheroes.”
He was referring to the 
defense, and how it was a team 
effort that led to the win. But 
really, the Wolverines — with 
a paltry offensive showing — 
did need a superhero, and as 
Stanley faltered under pressure 
again and again, the pass-
rushers might as well have been 
wearing capes.

Cazzie Russell on Howard’s next steps

As he sat there embracing both 
old and new fans of Michigan 
basketball, Cazzie Russell didn’t 
miss a beat. Despite not having 
donned a Michigan jersey since 
1966, 
the 
Wolverine 
legend’s 
presence loomed just as large.
Signing autographs as part of 
the release of a line of Michigan 
basketball memorabilia on Friday, 
Russell sat there as a beaming 
fan regaled him with a tale of his 
first Michigan basketball game 
— a rousing affair in which the 
legendary 
guard 
dropped 
48 
points. 
Next up was a woman who 
clung onto a framed old newspaper 
article 
portraying 
Russell 
headlining that year’s All-America 
team — a squad that included 
current Miami Heat President and 
NBA legend Pat Riley. 
Russell, sitting at a table with a 
20-foot photo of himself standing 
in the midst of a construction 
site that would become Crisler 
Center in the background, was as 
chipper as ever. His presence in 
Ann Arbor harkens back to the 
early chapters of the basketball 
program’s successes and calls for a 
moment of reflection before it’s set 
to enter a new era — one marked by 
freshly minted head coach Juwan 
Howard.
Recognizing 
the 
potential 
impact a visit with a program 
legend could have on his team, 
Howard brought Russell in to talk 
with his players last week. While 
Russell’s drop-in may have been 
more of a formality, a nod to the 
two-time consensus first team All-
American player, there is no doubt 
his mere presence elicited ideas of 
the heights to which a Michigan 
player can soar.
After all, this is the No. 1 overall 
pick in the 1966 NBA Draft, the 
1966 College Player of the Year and 
the man who led the Wolverines 
to three consecutive Big Ten 
titles and two Final Fours. When 
the Crisler Center construction 
was eventually completed, they 
dubbed the new stadium, “The 
house that Cazzie built.”
With 
that 
pedigree, 
it’s 
unsurprising that Russell has kept 

up with the program.
Following the team since his 
departure to the NBA in 1966, 
Russell was quick to share his 
thoughts on the decision to bring 
on Howard to stand at the helm. 
And judging by his questions, 
Russell is just anxious as the rest 
of us to see what Howard’s squad 
is going to look like.
“I think that it’s a great hire for 
several reasons,” Russell told The 
Daily. “It always was a dream of 
mine to come back and coach at 
my alma mater. It’s gotta be a great 
feeling, having played here.
“He seems to be well aware, 
very cognizant of where he is in 
terms of this program. So it’s good. 
I think he’s going to do well, of 
course we need to wait and see 
what type of game would he like 
to play. Up-tempo, how his team’s 
gonna be defensively? Will they do 
a good job of implementing some 
inside and outside stuff and not 
just specifically one facet?”
Perhaps Russell’s time with the 
program could lend some answers 
to his own questions. But he’ll be 
the first one to tell you that that 
was then, and this, as it goes, is 
now.
It may be an understatement 
to say that college basketball and 
the Michigan program specifically 
have changed since the ‘60’s. The 
three-point line wasn’t even added 
to NCAA courts until 1986.
“I drove around to look at even 
the great improvement down by 
the athletic department,” Russell 

said. “I mean, that’s a city within a 
city. A lot of things have changed, 
and you look at the impact of the 
changing of time, and what things 
are necessary to keep up with the 
program and keep up with other 
teams. 
“There’s a lot of things you have 
to do to stay competitive, so I get 
a chance to look at all this. I mean 
your own catering service. I mean, 
man, please!”
Now, all Russell can do is sit 
back and see the manifestation of 
the blood, sweat and tears he left in 
Ann Arbor.
After 
the 
signing 
session, 
Russell got up and went over 
to a reunion dinner with the 
remaining members of that 1966 
team — a tradition upheld since 
their graduation. And among 
the shared laughs, food and 
drink, it was inevitable that the 
conversation turned to legacy and 
how those players have left their 
mark on Michigan history.
“It’s fascinating to me to see 
this progression and then to think 
back on 1962 up until now, but 
you’re part of that history,” Russell 
said. “You look at everything, and 
maybe, just maybe, you might’ve 
had an impact or influence on 
things getting started in this 
direction. So you think back about 
how blessed you are to reflect 
about this history. 
“No matter what anybody says, 
they can’t take away from the 
fact that you were a part of this 
history.”

I 

don’t know about you all, but 
I’m exhausted.
Saturday, a pretty-good-
but-flawed 
Michigan 
team beat a 
pretty-good-
but-flawed 
Iowa team, 
10-3, in a game 
that clearly 
highlighted 
both team’s 
merits and 
shortcom-
ings. The Wolverines were favored 
by 3.5 points — and that seems 
about right. Their defense shone, 
their offense sputtered. The for-
mer outlasted the latter, and so 
Michigan is now 4-1 instead of 3-2. 
It was the fifth top-15 win of the 
Jim Harbaugh era, none of which 
have come away from Michigan 
Stadium. That’s a game Michigan 
wins at home and might not on the 
road.
And that’s all it was.
We’re five years into Harbaugh’s 
tenure now, and all of these narra-
tives follow a remarkably consis-
tent path. It’s time to stop treating 
every “big” game as a referendum 
on the Harbaugh era. This Iowa 
game, that coming Notre Dame 
game. Hell, even this Ohio State 
game. In all likelihood, none of 
it will bring about the “breaking 
point” that so many in the national 
media ecosystem seem to clamor 
for.
Some, like Fox Sports analyst 
Joel Klatt, billed this Iowa game 
as such. “I believe that Saturday is 
the defining moment of the Har-
baugh era,” Klatt said on The Herd 
with Colin Cowherd. “… If they do 
(win), there’s at least hope. If they 
don’t, they’re in trouble. I think 
it’s in-defendable if they lose this 
weekend.”
This is not to pick on Klatt 
specifically, who is merely one in 
an assembly line of analysts who 
recite similar tropes.
This specific team has some real 
flaws, no matter if its coach wants 
to acknowledge them, publicly 

or otherwise. Asked to assess his 
offense — which gained 267 yards, 
totaled under four yards per carry 
for the fourth consecutive game 
and failed to score in the final 53:33 
of the game — Harbaugh said: “I 
really do think they’re hitting their 
stride. Got great faith in our play-
ers and our coaches.” 
Some diagnosed the charac-
terization as wrong and tone deaf 
or — undoubtedly worse — correct 
and indicting. Others dismissed 
it as a defense mechanism for his 
players, who will face the brunt of 
criticism this week for an offense 
that looks lost.
Criticism is wholly warranted 
right now. This offense, billed as a 
bale of goods has, instead, been a 
bundle of mediocrity. No spin will 
change that. But what the head 
coach says publicly doesn’t matter 
if the actions behind the scenes 
dictate otherwise.
What it shouldn’t be, as every-
thing seems to funnel back to 
these days, is a commentary on the 
future of the Michigan football 
program, and specifically on the 
Harbaugh era.
Michigan is a top-10-to-15 
football program in the nation. 
It is a good program that almost 
always wins the games it should 
and almost never wins the games 
it shouldn’t. The latter is what 

prohibits upward ascension. That 
boils down to recruiting, execution 
and, yes, coaching. No, the momen-
tary satisfaction of removing the 
head coach would not be the salve 
to vault this program into that elite 
upper-echelon. 
This doesn’t seem to be the year 
that move happens, if it ever does. 
As it turns out, that leap is quite 
rare and quite difficult to sustain 
— particularly when your primary 
rival is among the best programs in 
the nation.
We’re five years in now. This 
is what it is. Not every game is 
“Harbaugh’s breaking point.” Most 
are not. When Michigan goes to 
Penn State, it will have a chance 
to win a road game of the ilk it has 
yet to do under Harbaugh. Take it 
to the bank that some commenta-
tors — national media, in particu-
lar — will bill it as some form of a 
breaking point. An inflection point. 
A moment of truth. Choose your 
cliché.
Win or lose, there will be some 
wildly reactionary narrative that 
will stray to one polar end. Then, 
we’ll gear up for Notre Dame 
weekend to do it all again. 
Sometimes a mid-season home 
win over Iowa is just that — no 
more, no less. Let’s stop pretend-
ing otherwise. Because I’m getting 
pretty tired of it.

End the Harbaugh whiplash
Defense puts together ‘masterpiece’

With 1:35 left in the fourth 
quarter, 
Michigan’s 
offense 
asked its defense to step up one 
more time. 
The unit had been bailed 
out all afternoon — the offense 
mired in a bewildered mess, 
the 
defense 
responding 
emphatically. 
Rinse, 
repeat. 
The whiplash hadn’t hindered 
defensive 
coordinator 
Don 
Brown’s unit. To that point, 
Iowa had a single rushing yard. 
Its quarterback, Nate Stanley, 
had been picked off three times. 
The Wolverines were flying. 
Eight sacks. Twelve tackles for 
loss.
Up 10-3, they just had to do it 
one more time. And, really, was 
there ever a doubt?
“When the game’s on the 
line, that’s what we want,” 
said 
senior 
defensive 
end 
Mike Danna after the game. 
“We wanted the defense up. 
Everybody on the sideline had 
juice. The coaches had juice. It 
was all about energy, and that’s 
what we want. We wanted our 
backs against the wall. We had 
the opportunity and came out 
on top.”
Despite advantageous field 

position and a fourth-down 
conversion to keep their brief 
hopes 
alive, 
the 
Hawkeyes 
succumbed to the Wolverines’ 
swarming defense one last time. 
With Iowa’s hopes growing 
ever 
fleeting, 
faced 
with 
a 
fourth-and-10 
from 
the 
Michigan 44-yard line, Stanley 
dropped back once more and 
quickly felt the heat of multiple 
incoming 
pass 
rushers. 
He 
somehow managed to release 
a left-handed prayer to his 
checkdown 
back, 
who 
was 
stopped well short of the line 
to gain. It was a fitting capper 
to one of the best defensive 
showcases of the Jim Harbaugh-
Don Brown era.
“Obviously 
that 
was 
a 
defensive 
masterpiece,” 
Harbaugh said. “Our defense, 
Don Brown, the coaches, the 
players. Don called a great 
game. They were very well 
prepared. Player-wise, it was 
just obvious from play one to the 
last play of the game, everybody 
was hustling and running and 
playing with great effort.”
Michigan’s 12 TFLs marked 
the 
18th 
time 
in 
Brown’s 
tenure the defense registered 
double-digit TFLs in a single 
game. Perhaps most notably, 
the 
Wolverines 
held 
Iowa’s 
purportedly vaunted bruising 
rushing attack to one yard, just 
the fourth time in recorded 
history the Hawkeyes had been 
held to one or fewer rushing 
yards in a game.
The latter point underscores 
the progress this defense has 
made since the 35-14 drubbing in 
Wisconsin two weeks ago, when 
the Badgers marched through 
this defense with remarkable 
ease. The 358-yard disparity 
between those outputs tells the 
entire tale.
The players knew coming into 
the week that Iowa would try 
to mimic some of the looks that 
gave them fits two weeks prior. 
Brown challenged his defense to 
rise to the challenge. There’s no 

parsing the obvious: Challenge 
accepted.
“I think we all just played 
our asses off on the defense. 
We knew it was power Iowa, 
the big dogs who just run 
it down your throat,” said 
sophomore defensive end Aidan 
Hutchinson, with a noticeable 
chide when rehearsing those 
cliches. “We showed ’em what 
kind of run defense we had.”
Added 
Harbaugh: 
“Don, 
during the week, he said he 
might jump off a tall building 
if some of those isolation plays 
work. They really thought they 
had them, and really thought 
the players had a great week of 
practice, and knew exactly what 
to do, how to do it, and did it 
with great intensity and great 
effort. 
“To hold a team to one yard 
rushing, that’s a masterpiece.”
The running game wasn’t the 
only facet which the defense 
emphasized in the lead up 
to the game, though. Stanley 
came into the game without 
having thrown an interception 
all season — and having been 
sacked more than four times 
only once in his career. Brown’s 
defense picked off Stanley thrice 
and sacked him eight times.
“We knew Stanley, coming 
into this game, didn’t throw any 
picks,” Hutchinson said. “After 
watching all the film, you see 
he never really got hit. After 
today, we smacked him and that 
showed what happens when you 
apply pressure on that guy.”
And still, in spite of a 
thoroughly-dominant defensive 
effort, 
Michigan’s 
defense 
stepped onto the field with just 
over a minute and needed a stop. 
They’d been on the field for 32:27 
to that point. They’d allowed just 
six of 17 third- and fourth-down 
conversions. They’d played 13 
drives and allowed 17.6 yards 
per drive and three points.
In short, they’d done all 
they’d been asked. So what was 
one more?

Harbaugh: Offense is hitting stride

An hour after a game in which 
Michigan scored just 10 points, 
averaged just 4.5 yards per play 
and gained less than 300 yards 
total, Jim Harbaugh sat behind 
a microphone and declared that 
his team’s offense was “hitting 
our stride.”
There are a lot of ways to 
deflect criticism after a game 
like Saturday’s. Harbaugh might 
have pointed to Iowa’s defense. 
He might have said things are 
still working into place under 
offensive 
coordinator 
Josh 
Gattis, that even in the second 
month of the season, it’s OK to 
be working out kinks in a new 
system. He might have reiterated 
what he had said five minutes 
prior — that the Wolverines 
took what was there against 
an 
opponent 
whose 
games 
always look like Saturday’s 10-3 
Michigan win.
It’s hard to sell that the 
offense actually played well. It’s 
harder to sell that this was some 
kind of peak.
Because if there’s even an 
inkling of truth to it, then the 
Wolverines have a long eight 
weeks ahead.
Whatever good will built up 
since Michigan’s 52-0 demolition 
of Rutgers a week ago — the first 
time Gattis’ offense seemed 
to have a clear, well-executed 
plan of attack — evaporated into 
confusion 
and 
consternation 
against Iowa. After a solid first 
few drives in which the run game 
seemed to get some momentum, 
senior 
quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson found junior wideout 
Nico Collins on a jump ball and 
freshman Zach Charbonnet ran 
for a two-yard score, Michigan 
failed to string together another 
coherent set of plays until the 
start of the fourth quarter.
When that finally happened, it 
ended in Jake Moody missing a 
34-yard field goal.
While the defense played to 
the moment, showing the kind of 
urgency needed to win against 
a top-20 opponent, the offense 
looked listless and disinterested. 

Patterson finished 14-of-26 for 
147 yards with an interception 
and no touchdowns. It added 
up to a 93.6 rating — worse than 
every game he played last season 
in an offense that was accused 
of being antiquated and out of 
style.
“Once we hit that (pass to 
Collins), they started to back 
off a little bit and we started 
to take our underneath reads,” 
Patterson said.
In other words, the Hawkeyes’ 
defense dictated what Michigan 
could and couldn’t do. Gattis 
has 
said 
he 
wants 
exactly 
the opposite to happen in his 
system, 
one 
predicated 
on 
putting players in conflict, so no 
matter what choice they make, 
it’s wrong. And yet, his unit 
has been the one forced into 
impossible choices repeatedly — 
and it happened all day long on 
Saturday.
“I thought Shea in particular 
took 
what 
was there and 
sometimes 
there 
wasn’t 
anything there,” 
Harbaugh 
said. 
“And 
managed 
the 
game 
extremely well.”
But Harbaugh 
didn’t 
recruit 
Patterson as a 
game-manager. 
The nervous tension in the 
building when Patterson took 
a seat next to Harbaugh at 
Crisler Center for a basketball 
game two years ago, and the 
explosion of joy in Ann Arbor 
when he eventually committed 
wasn’t because Michigan had 
secured another Brandon Peters 
or John O’Korn. Patterson came 
here to fix an offense that, in 
2017, looked a whole lot like the 
offense we saw on Saturday. One 
that couldn’t keep a drive going, 
get opponents to respect the 
passing game or take advantage 
of the talent on the field.
For 
a 
year 
in 
between, 
Patterson’s first under center 
in a Michigan uniform, things 
were not perfect, but they were 
markedly better. The run game 

hummed as the offensive line 
overperformed 
expectations. 
Patterson proved to excel at 
creating 
something 
out 
of 
nothing, running around out 
of the pocket with a knack 
for 
finding 
whoever 
would 
inevitably break open. It didn’t 
look great against Ohio State, and 
Florida stopped the Wolverines 
in their tracks, but it’s hard not 
to acknowledge that Michigan 
might have spent this offseason 
trying to fix something that 
wasn’t broken.
The first five games of this 
season are the result. The 
Wolverines managed to win 
four of those on the back of their 
defense. But every opponent left 
is either on the road or ranked, 
and most of them won’t commit 
the comedy of errors Iowa fell 
victim to at times on Saturday.
“That’s just kinda football. 
That’s how it goes sometimes,” 
Patterson said. “You’re gonna 
have days like 
that. And when 
the defense is 
playing 
lights-
out like that, just 
stay patient.”
It would be 
much 
easier 
to buy that if 
Michigan hadn’t 
waded the last 
five 
games 
of 
the season like 
a team searching for an answer. 
Or if they seemed any closer to 
finding one against Iowa than 
they were before.
“I really do think they’re 
hitting their stride,” Harbaugh 
reiterated when pressed on his 
answer. “Got great faith in our 
players and our coaches.”
He was asked in exactly what 
ways that might be the case.
“In every way,” he said. Then 
he repeated himself. “In every 
way. That’s what I see.”
Harbaugh knows far more 
about football than most people 
on this planet. But it doesn’t take 
a genius to realize what anyone 
can see with two plain eyes.
If this is Michigan’s stride, 
then 
Michigan’s 
offensive 
reclamation has failed.

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh’s program has yet to make the leap so many national commentators expect it to.

FOOTBALL

I really do think 
they’re hitting 
their stride. ... 
In every way.
