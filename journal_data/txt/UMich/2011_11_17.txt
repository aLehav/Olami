Former U.S. senate
majority leader
praises insurance
created at 'U'
By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily Staff Reporter
When provisions of the
Affordable Care Act go into
effect in 2014, health insurance
will undergo a drastic change in
its methodology - part of which
was developed at the University.
As the keynote speaker of
the symposium on "The State of
Value Based Insurance Design"
yesterday, former U.S. Senate
Majority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-South lakotaaddrhssed.tai
crowd of about 150 insurance
industry leaders, University stu-
dents and faculty. At the Univer-
sity's North Campus Research
Complex, Daschle discussed the
necessity of changing the health
care perspective from being ill-
ness centric to wellness centric.
Daschle noted that some cur-
rent issues with health care are
quality, access, cost and trans-

parency. However, he lauded
Ann Arbor for excelling in these
areas.
"We have islands of excel-
lence; Ann Arbor's a good
example in a sea of mediocri-
ty," Daschle said. "We haven't
addressed the quality challeng-
es that we face effectively in our
country today."
Value Based Insurance
Design, or V-BID, which is
used in the national health
care reform bill and the public
and private insurance sectors,
was created by University fac-
ulty. The University's Center for
Value-Based Insurance Design,
which is housed in the School
of Public Health, was formed in
2005.
The goal of V-BID is to bal-
ance health carp 'co ts with
quality. In order to do this,
health care services are equated
based on their different val-
ues, and patients' out-of-pocket
costs are adjusted in accordance
to the value of the service.
The University also uses
V-BID in MHealthy, which
offers wellness programs,

Students share
personal stories
about effects of
repressive regime
By PETER SHAHIN
For the Daily
When Zanah Ghalawanji
logged onto Facebook one day,
she was met by a chat detailing

her friend's torture at the hands
of the Syrian government.
Ghalawanji, a freshman at the
University of Michigan-Dear-
born, said herfriend hadwritten
a poem promoting democracy
in Syria and was subsequently
arrested and tortured by Syrian
intelligence agents. His father
then paid a large sum of money
for his son's release, according
to Ghalawanji.
Last night, Ghalawanji joined
the campus group Students

Allied for Freedom and Equality
as members held a candlelight
vigil on the Diag to commemo-
rate those who have lost their
lives protesting against the
current Syrian government.
The crowd of about 50 stu-
dents, mostly SAFE members,
observed a moment of silence in
remembrance, while individu-
als shared personal views and
experiences with the uprising.
The Syrian uprising began
in March as part of the larger

Arab Spring movement across
the Middle East. However, the
regime of SyriaPresident Bashar
al-Assad has cracked down on
protesters, and Syrian armed
forces have remained loyal to
the government. According to
the United Nations, more than
3,500 people have been killed
since the uprising started, but
many more may be unaccounted
for. The Arab League suspended
Syria's membership on Nov. 12,

STATE LEGISLATION
Second bridge to Canada
on hold after Senate vote


Senate committee
votes down bills
due to taxpayer
funding concerns
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
After years of struggle, the
battle over a second bridge that
would link Detroit and Wind-

sor took a new turn.
The state Senate ended an
argument between Repub-
lican Gov. Rick Snyder and
Manuel Moroun, the owner of
the Ambassador Bridge, after
members in the Senate Eco-
nomic Development Commit-
tee voted to kill bills 410 and
411, which would allow for the
creation of a second bridge to
Canada. The Oct. 19 vote was
made based on senators' belief
that the bills lack protections

against public funding, Sny-
der's projections of the bridge's
economic impact were overly
ambitious and the likelihood
that the project's cost will
exceed estimates.
While Snyder proposed that
Michigan and Canada co-own
the new bridge, Moroun wants
to privately construct and own
the potential second bridge.

Obama:1i pyto 2,500 Marines
will deploy to northern Australia

Move aimed to
counter Chinese
influence throughout
Pacific region
CANBERRA, Australia (AP)
- Signaling a determination to
counter a rising China, President
Barack Obama vowed today to
expandU.S. influence intheAsia-
Pacific region and "project power
and deter threats to peace" in
that part of the world even as he
reduces defense spending and
winds down two wars.
"The United States is a Pacific
power, and we are here to stay,"
he declared in a speech to the
Australian Parliament, sending
an unmistakable message to Bei-
jing.
Obama's bullish speech came
several hours after announcing
he would send military aircraft
and up to 2,500 Marines to north-
ern Australia for a training hub to
help allies and protect American
interests across Asia. He declared
the U.S. is not afraid of China, by
far the biggest and most powerful
country in the region.
China immediately ques-
tioned the U.S. move and said it
deserved further scrutiny.
Emphasizing that a U.S. pres-
ence in the Asia-Pacific region is
a top priority of his administra-
tion, Obama stressed that any
reductions in U.S. defense spend-
ing will not come at the expense
of that goal.
"Let there be no doubt: in the
Asia Pacific in the 21st century,
the United States of America is
all in," he said.
For Obama, Asia represents
both a security challenge and an
economic opportunity. Speaking
in broad geopolitical terms, the
president asserted: "With most
of the world's nuclear powers
and some half of humanity, Asia
will largely define whether the
century ahead will be marked by
conflict or cooperation, needless
suffering or human progress."
Virtually everything Obama is

doing on his nine-day trip across
the Asia-Pacific region has a
Chinese subtext, underscoring a
relationship that is at once coop-
erative and marked by tensions
over currency, human rights and
military might.
China's military spending has
increased threefold since the
1990s to about $160 billion last
year, and its military recently
tested a new stealth jet fighter
and launched its first aircraft
carrier. A congressional advisory
panel on yesterday said China's
buildup is focused on dealing
with America's own defenses and
exploiting possible weaknesses.
The panel, the U.S.-China Eco-
nomic and Security Review Com-
mission, urged the White House
and Congress to look more close-
ly at China's military expansion
and pressed for a tougher stance
against what it called anticom-
petitive Chinese trade policies.
The U.S. and smaller Asian
nations have grown increasingly
concerned about China's claims
of dominion over Pacific waters
and the revival of old territorial
disputes, including confronta-
tions over the South China Sea.
China says it has sovereignty
over the vast sea.
Responding to questions at a
news conference yesterday with
Australian Prime Minister Julia
Gillard, Obama said, "The notion
that we fear China is mistaken."
While stressing his intent to
increase'influence in the Asia-
Pacific region, Obama avoided a
avoided a confrontational tone
with China in his speech to the
Australian parliament.
"We've seen that China can be
a partner, from reducingtensions
on the Korean Peninsula to pre-
venting proliferation," he said.
"We'll seek more opportunities
for cooperation with Beijing,
including greater communica-
tion between our militaries to
promote understanding and
avoid miscalculation.
In a note of caution, however,
he added: " We will do this, even
as continue to speak candidly
with Beijing about the impor-

tance of upholding international
norms and respecting the univer-
sal human rights of the Chinese
people."
China was immediately leery
of the prospect of an expanded
U.S. military presence in Austra-
lia. Foreign Ministry spokesman
Liu Weimin said there should be
discussion as to whether the plan
was in line with the common
interests of the international
community.
With military bases and tens of
thousands of troops in Japan and
South Korea, the United States
has maintained a significant mili-
tary presence in Asia for decades.
Australia lies about 5,500 miles
south of China, and its northern
shores would give the U.S. easier
access to the South China Sea, a
vital commercial route.
The plan outlined by Obama
will allow the United States to
keep a sustained force on Aus-
tralian bases and position equip-
ment and supplies there, giving
the U.S. ability to train with allies
in the region and respond more
quickly to humanitarian or other
crises.
About 250 U.S. Marines will
begin a rotation in northern Aus-
tralia starting next year, with
a full force of 2,500 military
personnel staffing up over the
next several years. The United
States will bear the cost of the
deployment and the troops will
be shifted from other deploy-
ments around the world. Having
ruled out military reductions in
Asia and the Pacific, the Obama
administration has three main
areas where it could cut troop
strength: Europe, the Middle
East and the U.S.
All U.S. troops are being with-
drawn from Iraq by the end of
this year, and a drawdown in
Afghanistan is underway. But the
Pentagon has said recently that
the U.S. will maintain a major
presence in the greater Middle
East as a hedge against Iranian
aggression and influence. A more
likely area for troop reductions
is Europe, although no decisions
have been announced.

Clinton announces
$10 million aid
package for
ravaged nation
BANGKOK (AP) - U.S. Sec-
retary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton announced a $10 million
aid package for flood-ravaged
Thailand yesterday during a visit
to express solidarity.
Clinton met with Prime Min-
ister Yingluck Shinawatra as
flooding continued to plague
areas around Bangkok, the capi-
tal.
Thai authorities announced,
however, that water in the capi-
tal is receding and all main
streets will be dry in two weeks,
providing good news after
months of floods that have killed
564 people nationwide.
Some 20 of Thailand's 77
provinces have been hit by
floods since late July, mostly
in northern and central areas,
and more than one-fifth of the
country's 64 million people have
been affected. The flooding has
scared away tens of thousands of

tourists.
Thailand is a long-standing
U.S. ally. Clinton is in the region
to attend a Southeast Asian sum-
mit in Bali, Indonesia.
"During the past century we
have stood by each other in times
of challenge and we are proud to
stand by you now in this time of
challenge, as you contend with
the worst floods in your nation's
history," she said in a news con-
ference with the Thai leader.
She said the U.S. was provid-
ing both military and civil assis-
tance "to save and restore lives
and to support Thailand's long-
term rebuilding and recovery,"
and that teams were currently
assessing how best to help.
The U.S. is already providing
medical assistance and the U.S.
Navy ship Lassen is in a Thai
port with crew and helicopters
to help relief efforts, Clinton
said.
She said the U.S. would help
reopen Bangkok's inundated
Don Muang domestic airport
and rehabilitate flooded police
stations.
Washington is also consult-
ing with the Thai government
on how to restore important cul-

tural sites, such as the ancient
capital of Ayutthaya, which is in
one of the mostbadly hit areas.
Clinton is to visit a flood vic-
tims evacuation center today.
Also in town was U.N. Secre-
tary-General Ban Ki-moon,
who visited some flood-affected
areas yesterday.
Many areas remain flooded,
especially those to the west and
east of Bangkok, and it is still
expected to take weeks for all
that water to reach the Gulf of
Thailand. The runoff spread
to some sections of Rama II,
a major road in Bangkok, but
vehicles were still able to drive
through, officials said.
But the government appears
to have averted a worst-case sce-
nario in which the densely pop-
ulated and economically critical
center of Bangkok would have
succumbed.
The Bangkok Metropolitan
Authority said the overall situ-
ation in the capital is improv-
ing quickly, especially in Don
Muang, where the domestic air-
port is located, and Lad Phrao, a
district studded with office tow-
ers, condominiums and a popu-
lar shopping mall.

64 percent without

of attorney
WASHINGTON (AP) - Most
people don't want to think about
death, much less plan for it -
especially when they feel healthy
and young in their middle-age
years.
And that, some baby boomers
say, is one of the big reasons so few
of them have end-of-life legal doc-
uments such asa living will.
An Associated Press-Life-
GoesStrong.com poll found that
64 percent of boomers - those
born between 1946 and 1964 -
say they don't have a health care
proxy or living will. Those docu-
ments would guide medical deci-
sions should a patient be unable to
communicate with doctors.

said Mary McGee, 53, of Archbald,
Pa. "So, death and dying isn't on
my mind alot."

mer, exercises five to seven days

to kickboxing, and her parents are

The same goes for 57-year-old
Sandy Morgan in Richmond, Va.
"You know when they say,
'Sixty is the new 40,' I really
believe that," said Morgan, a
retired teacher who is working
part time for an executive search
firm.
Morgan's parents are still
healthy intheir early 80s. She says
she runs three miles a day twice a
week, practices yoga twice a week
and takes partin a rigorous fitness
boot camp twice a week. End-of-
life decisions aren't on her radar.
"I just feel like it's something I'll
probably think about in my late
60s or 70s," said Morgan.

A living will spells out a
patient's wishes for medical care
if he or she is unable to communi-
cate with doctors.
The health care proxy, also
known as a health care power of
attorney, allows an individual to
select a person he or she trusts
to make decisions about medical
care should the patient become
incapacitated.
Kathy Brandt said living wills
and health care proxies are agood
idea for everyone whether they
are healthy and young or older and
not so healthy.
Brandt, a senior vice president
at the National Hospice and Palli-
ative Care Organization, said the
two documents can spare fami-
lies a painful fight and ensure
that patients receive - or don't
receive - the medical treatment
they wish should they end up in a
situation where they can't speak
for themselves.
The living will is not "all or
nothing," said Brandt. A person
could say he or she wants every-
thing, something or nothing. For
example, one person may want
heroic measures taken to prolong
life, while another may want to
be resuscitated but decide against
being dependent on breathing
machines long-term.
Brandt pointed to high-profile
cases such as the Florida family
fight over Terri Schiavo as a smart
reason to draft a living will and
health care proxy.
At 26, Schiavo collapsed at her
St. Petersburg home in 1990 with
no end-of-life care instructions
in writing. Her heart stopped and
she suffered what doctors said
was irreversible brain damage
that left her in a permanent veg-
etative state. Her husband said
his wife would not have wanted to
live in a vegetative state; her par-
ents wanted her kept alive.

Students pitch
tents at Berkeley
despite policy that
forbids camping
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Police arrested a number of
Occupy protesters and students
yesterday who stormed into a
downtown San Francisco bank
and shouted slogans as they
tried to set up camp in the lobby.
The arrests came after more
than 100 demonstrators rushed
into a Bank of America branch,
chanting "money for schools
and education, not for banks
and corporations."
Police officers in riot gear
cuffed the activists one-by-one
as hundreds more demonstra-
tors surrounded the building,
blocking entrances and exits.
Deputy Police Chief Kevin
Cashman said 80 arrests were
expected for trespassing. Sus-
pects were taken to jail, cited
and released.
Elsewhere, students and anti-
Wall Street activists settled into
a new encampment at the Uni-
versity of California, Berkeley,
and visited the state Capitol to
demand the restoration of fund-
ing for higher education.
At Berkeley, police watched
over about two dozen tents that
were pitched Tuesday night on

a student plaza despite a cam-
pus policy that forbids camping.
Police warned that protesters
could be arrested if they didn't
leave.
Seth Weinberg, a 20-year-
old cognitive science major,
said he slept in a tent on Sproul
Plaza to press the university to
lobby for more public educa-
tion funding.
"There should be a way for
anyone who wants to go to col-
lege if they choose to," Wein-
berg said. "What the university
doesn't understand is that we
are not camping out. This is a
constant protest."
In Sacramento, about 75 stu-
dent leaders and a few admin-
istrators from UC Berkeley and
the University of California,
Davis lobbied lawmakers and
the governor to allocate more
money to education.
Adam Thongsavat, stu-
dent body president at UC
Davis, called on lawmakers
to be "more courageous, more
aggressive and more thought-
ful."
"Come to our campuses and
see how your actions affect
us," he said. "I want you all
to tell us why prisons deserve
more spending than universi-
ties."
University of California
President Mark Yudof issued
a statement of support for the
students' "passion and convic-

tion" in support of public higher
education.
"We also suffer together the
strains caused by what has been
a long pattern of state disinvest-
ment in the University of Cali-
fornia," he said.
Protesters in San Francisco
marched through downtown
in a demonstration partly orga-
nized by ReFund California, a
coalition of student groups and
university employee unions.
The group bused in protest-
ers from UC Berkeley, the Uni-
versity of California, Merced
and other schools to join Occu-
py San Francisco activists as
they marched to the bank and
the state building.
The marches in support of
higher education came as police
in San Francisco and San Diego
cleared encampments in those

Supercommittee
hopes to cut $1.2
trillion before
Thanksgiving
WASHINGTON (AP) - Lob-
byists for a day, a band of mil-
lionaires stormed Capitol Hill
yesterday to urge Congress to
tax them more.
They had a little trouble get-
tingin. Itturns outthereare pro-
cedures, even for the really rich.
But once inside, their message
was embraced by liberals and
tolerated by some conservatives
- including the ideological lead-
er of anti-tax lawmakers, who
had some advice for them, too.
"If you think the federal gov-
ernment can spend your money
better than you can, then by all
means" pay more in taxes than
you owe, said Grover Norquist,
the head of a group that has
gotten almost all congressio-
nal Republicans to pledge to
vote against tax hikes. The IRS
should have a little line on the
form where people can donate
money to the government, he
suggested, 'just like the tip line
on a restaurant receipt."
In the silence left by the pri-
vate efforts of the "supercom-
mittee" to find $1.2 trillion or
more in deficit cuts by Thanks-

giving, free advice flowed in
public.
And not just any advice: pie-
in-the-sky suggestions from
those not connected to the
talks, mostly to reopen debates
that have led nowhere. The mil-
lionaires want the panel to raise
taxes on people who earn more
than $1 million, even though
most Republicans are commit-
ted against the idea. And 150
House member and senators
urged a much bigger debt-and-
deficit deal, even as a small-
scope agreement is proving
elusive.
While they were at it, the
lawmakers insisted that bipar-
tisanship was not, in fact, dead.
This group of House mem-
bers and senators shared a stage
and some jokes and signed a let-
ter urging the supercommittee
of Republicans and Democrats
to find the required $1.2 trillion
in cuts - plus about $2.8 trillion
more. They all want the panel
to avoid triggering automatic
cuts as a penalty for failing.
"Congress working together,"
read posters behind the group.
So this uneasy alliance of 150
Republicans and Democrats
will vote for whatever deal the
supercommittee strikes?
"No," said House Democratic
Whip Steny Hoyer. "Nobody's
going to commit to the deal
until they see the deal."

A motivational speaker
Karman brought important message to campus
The University hosted a talk by Tawakkul Karman, one of the
three 2011 Nobel Peace Prize winners, on Monday. Her mes-
sage of peace and equality was powerfully communicated to
the students, faculty and Ann Arbor residents who attended and it
was an honor to have her as a campus speaker. Karman - the first
Yemeni to win a Nobel Prize - is an inspiration to minority com-
munities and women, and she proves that diplomatic measures can
produce results. The University made a strong statement by inviting
Karman to speak to the community, and should strive to continue
bringing powerful speakers to campus.

f you are a college senior, pro-
fessor or an alum, I'd like to
ask you for a gift.
I'd like you
to write a brief
essay about your
college experi-
ence - an evalu-
ation of what
went well, what
didn't and what
you learned
along the way. ERIK
Feel free to TORENBERG
write this as a
short paper or
divide your experience into cat-
egories - intellectual exploration,
relationships, self-knowledge and
life preparation - and grade your-
self in each area.
In exchange for sending these
to erik.torenberg@gmail.com, I'll
send you a personal thank-you note
and write a column synthesizing
the results next semester.
This gift request is inspired by
David Brooks' column, The Life
Report, which made the same
request of people over age 70 for
two main reasons.
First, our culture does not pro-
vide enough opportunities for self-
appraisal. Sometimes we stumble
across a moment to contemplate
how we got here, how we're doing
and how we can do better, but there
is no specific tradition prompting
us to do so.
Second, a collection of personal
essays would benefit young adults.
"Young people are educated in
many ways" Brooks writes, "but
they are given relatively little help
in understanding how a life devel-
ops, how careers and families
evolve, what are the common mis-
takes and the common blessings
of modern adulthood." Additional
perspectives would inform young
adults as they begin to make impor-
tant life decisions.
I ask for this gift - specified to
your college experience - for the
same two reasons.

College students, too, can learn
from people who've navigated the
University terrain before, whether
by learning from their example or
merely using their story as a means
to reflect upon their own.
College students also have few
opportunities for self-evaluation.
Our grades tell us how well we
understand cert iipaits of a sub-
ject, but they don't tell us if we are
developing lasting relationships,
challenging our beliefs or becom-
ing the person we want to become.
These essays will encourage us to
address our personal goals and eval-
uate our progress in achieving them.
Such introspection is fundamen-
tal: How can we evaluate how we're
doing if we don't know what we're
trying to accomplish? Rarely do we
think about what it means for us
to make the most out of our educa-
tion. The thoughtful ones who do
ask the tough questions, receive, at
best, insufficient answers - "Get
involved! Get connections! Get
laid!" - and, at worst, potentially
contradictory ones - "Do what you
love, but be practical!"
What does it mean to make the
most out of an education? There are
a myriad of answers, of course, and
these essays will illuminate many
of them. While an answer to such
a question can neither be complete
nor universal - there are always
unexpected opportunities that we
can't foresee and no one account
can work for everyone - such intro-
spection is still valuable, even if all
it does is personalize the rubric to
which you evaluate yourself and
your projects.
So no, these essays won't pro-
vide the exact blueprints to making
the most out of an education, but
they may indicate that most people
believe in striving for some com-
bination of A, B and C things, and
they went about achieving them in
D,E and F ways. There might not,
though, be such an overlapping
consensus.
At the very least, your essays will

provide valuable source material to
help us think about what we'reaim-
ing to accomplish and how we're
doing.
Write an essay
about your 'U'
experience.
If you're an alum, I'm curious to
read about how what you learned in
college applies to what you're doing
now and perhaps how you feel you
could have better prepared your-
self. Briefly note to college seniors
how you thought about post-grad-
uation plans and how you might
think about them differently today.
If you're a professor, I'm curious
to read how you think you could
have gotten more inside of - and
outside of- the classroom and how
professors could have played more
of a role in your undergraduate
experience.
If you're a college senior, we'll
be curious to hear what you think
you did well and what you think
you could have done better. It will
be interesting to compare these
answers with those by people who
graduated many years ago. I'd also
like to hear what your plans are for
the remainder of college in light of
what you've learned.
These essays could change our
perceptions of college success. In
addition to providing valuable per-
spective to the incoming freshmen,
the departing senior and everyone
in between, these essays will also
benefit those curious about living
well and life-long learning.
Those who will receive the most
benefits from these essays, how-
ever, will be the people who write
them.

Karman was invited to speak as part of the
University's Arabic Language Flagship Pro-
gram. Her speech discussed the changes in the
Arab Spring, which is a series of recent demo-
cratic uprisings against governments across
the Middle East. As ajournalist and a member
of the Al-Islah political party, the opposition
party in Yemen, she believes in the importance
of women's involvement in politics and peace-
ful protests.
The University should be commended for
bringingKarman to Ann Arbor and promoting
the event. Rackham Auditorium was packed
with an attentive audience. The speech cre-
ated a forum for students to think about race,
religion and gender in different ways, and fos-
tered more open and receptive thoughts. After
her speech, there was an intelligent dialogue
between Karman and students who asked
questions.
Karman suggested that people are citizens
of theword and stressed a general loyalty to
humanity. She discussed her belief in peaceful
protests, which is a message that should reso-
nate with students. In the wake of the protests
of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.)
who spoke on campus last month and the riots
at Pennsylvania State University, students
should take notice that the most powerful way
to get their message across is through non-
violent protests.
Karman stressed that the power of women

is growing. In Yemen, women are taking con-
trol of protests and becomingmore involved in
revolutions. Karman is an example to the rest
of the world that women can have consider-
able influence. When women across the world
develop similar goals to Karman's, gender
equality will have made significant progress.
The other 2011 Nobel Peace Prize winners
were Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf
and peace activist Leymah Gbowee. Each of
the three female Nobel Prize winners exem-
plifies an overall trend toward gender equal-
ity in developing worlds. These women play an
important role in pushing social change for-
ward in developing countries and serve as an
example of the role all women should strive to
take in working for social progress.
In an interview after the event, Karman told
The Michigan Daily that students also have a
positive impact on the world. "Student-led
movements have always been a part in chang-
ing history and fulfilling people's dreams of
achieving freedom and dignity," she said.
Students have the opportunity to rally for
what they believe in, and following the wise
words of Karman, they can make their goals
a reality. Speakers like Karman demonstrate
to the student body that constructive change
is possible for anyone willing to dedicate
themselves to a cause they believe in, and the
University should work to bring more motiva-
tional individuals to speak to students.

ALLISON SHERMAN I
Put the Arts in LSA

Study abroad struggles

A liberal arts education gives students
the opportunity to achieve personal growth
and to expand their intellectual capabili-
ties. The College of Literature, Science and
the Arts offers courses in the humanities,
social sciences and natural sciences with the
aim of providing the liberal arts experience.
Though the distribution requirements gener-
ally encompass classes relevant to the liberal
arts experience, focus has consistently been
on the "Literature" and "Science." Quite
often, the "Arts" have been neglected.
This week, students in LSA have the
opportunity to change this. In addition to the
10 elected representative seats on the ballot
for LSA Student Government's Fall 2011 elec-
tion cycle, there will be three ballot ques-
tions that students will be asked to answer.
These questions help LSA-SG prioritize our
various initiatives, poll student opinions and
provide us with data that we use when lob-
bying the college administration for change.
This semester, there are three ballot ques-
tions: one regarding the installation of new
water bottle filling stations across campus,
another asking students if they would like to
receive automatic grade notifications from
Wolverine Access when professors post final
course grades at the end of the semester and
a question regarding the creation of a minor
in the School of Art & Design that would be
available to LSA students.
I will be the first to say that my stick fig-
ures will not live up to the legacy of Monet or

Picasso. But I am also certain that students in
LSA will benefit from the opportunity to pur-
sue a creative minor in the fine arts. Many
students have a passion for the arts, and
while the bulk of their academic interests lie
in their LSA concentration, they should also
have the opportunity to receive a minor in
the School of Art & Design. As an executive
board member of LSA-SG, I strongly support
the creation of a minor in the School of Art &
Design available for LSA students. Whether
students pursue the minor asa supplement to
their LSA concentration because they need
a creative outlet, or simply because they are
passionate about the arts, a minor in the fine
arts will benefit the lives of LSA students.
In the past, various minors and majors
were developed, presented and implemented
as a result of LSA-SG's campaigns. These
include the international studies major and
minor, the peace and social justice minor
and others. With the support of students,
the same can happen for an LSA minor in the
School of Art & Design.
As a student in LSA, if you vote inthis elec-
tion, not only do you fulfill your civic duty,
but you also voice your opinion on an impor-
tant college matter. By voting in this election,
LSA-SG can make student interests become
a reality. Simply go to www.vote.umich.edu
and cast your vote right now. Today is the last
day to vote. Make your voice heard!

Within the last month,
I've gone from being
excited about study-
ing abroad next
year to feeling
like the experi-
ence has become
quite a chore. In
my search for
programs, I've
become disap-
pointed in the EAGHAN
University's DAVIS
resources for
students poten-
tially studying abroad. Sure, the
University boasts that it has sent
thousands of students abroad on
University-sponsored programs, but
how do Michigan's programs com-
pare to those of other universities?
In my experience, the University's
outreach and willingness to accom-
modate arange ofstudy abroad inter-
ests is less than satisfactory. Though
this topic is far less controversial
thanothers I've covered, I'm sure I'll
receive a few scathing e-mails from
former study abroad students, ask-
ing me how I could possibly speak
against a program that I have yet to
participate in. It's a valid concern,
but while the University's programs
may be numerous, they're too nar-
row. Do you have plans to studying
abroad in Dublin next semester? I
hope you're an engineer, or else your
dreams of the Celtic Isle aren'tgoing
to be fulfilled by the University..
I know you may think it's a bit
ridiculous to hold a grudge against
the University for not allowing me
to study in Ireland, but the prob-
lems don't end there. When scroll-
ing through University-sponsored
programs, you may be confused as
to why the range of places and pro-

grams are so fragmented. There are
many programs that are only.avail-
able one semester, and many only
occur during spring and summer
terms. Aside from fragmentation,
the way for selecting study abroad
programs appears to have been
designed and implemented in 1995.
The interface is hardlyuser-friendly,
and you may spend a few hours try-
ing to calculate the cost of your trip.
Perhaps I'm analyzing this a bit too
much - Michigan does offer more
programs than many other state uni-
versities, but then again, we aren't
just another state university.
A majority of the University's
programs are offered through the
Center for Global and Intercul-
tural Study, and I attended one of
the mandatory introductory ses-
sions last month for students plan-
ning on studying abroad through
CGIS. Aside from beingterribly bor-
ing and hardly relevant, it is clear
the University has capitalized on
its large number of students who
wish to study abroad. When I asked
about a program that wasn't offered,
the speaker promptly told me that
though they did not have program,
many regions of the world are simi-
lar, and I may be able to experience
the same way of life despite the dis-
tance of nearly 500 miles between
the two cities. Perhaps I shall stand
corrected, but I think the aforemen-
tioned statement was fairly ignorant
for a person employed by the Center
for Global and Intercultural studies.
After becoming disillusioned
with the University's programs,
I researched other programs not
sponsored by the University. There
is an abundance of additional pro-
grams, some less than impressive
and some that mimic the Univer-

sity's format. Programs vary in their
structure - some are sponsored
by American institutions and are
open to all eligible undergraduates.
Clearly, there are many programs
that may look less than impressive,
but are heavily advertised. Look past
these flashy programs and instead
search for programs that are estab-
lished and allow direct enrollment
into a foreign university (which
includes transcripts not from the
program, but from the university.)
The CGIS office
isn't as helpful
as it should be.
After many hours of research
and consulting former participants
of the program, I've found a study
abroad solution. My chosen pro-
gram is comparable to CGIS - but
includes airfare - and will enroll
me in the same university in Spain
that the University program would.
The difference between the two
programs is the thousands of dol-
lars that will remain in my pockets.
If you attend a CGIS workshop, the
speaker will most likely discour-
age non-University sponsored pro-
grams because "they don't offer the
support of the University." But from
what I've experienced, the Univer-
sity's study abroad support is worth
much less than the aforementioned
dollar amount.

BRIDGE
From Page 1A
White Lake), said Kowall voted
against the bill because he could
not be sure that taxpayer dollars
would not be used to fund the
bridge.
"While the supporters are
absolutely sincere in their belief
that taxpayers will not be on the
hook for any of this ... it could be
changed quite literally tomor-
row by simple majority vote,"
Murray said.
Pointing to the Mackinac
Bridge, built in 1957, and the
Zilwaukee Bridge just north of
Saginaw, Murray said it is not
unprecedented for lawmakers
to shift the burden of funding
public projects from their origi-
nal private sponsors to taxpay-
ers. Murray said the evidence
suggests that the costs of build-
ing bridges as large as the pro-
posed New International Trade
Crossing are often higher than
expected.
"Ballparking it, instead of
$2.4 billion, this thing may cost
upwards of $4.5 or $5 billion
when all is said and done," Mur-
ray said.
Estimations for "cost over-
runs" of the proposed bridge
ranged from 16 percent to 108
percent, according to Murray.
He added that because of the
decline in traffic on the Ambas-
sador Bridge over the last 10
years, it is likely that the new
bridge would not be as profit-
able as Snyder projected, and
the state would therefore resort
to charging tolls for entry.
,Snyder and other proponents
of the project, who have attrib-
uted the decline to the economic
downturn and citizens' fear of
terrorism, have remained opti-
mistic about the future of the
proposed bridge.
State Sen. Rick Jones (R-
Grand Ledge) said the project is
central to improving the state's
economy, citing the fact that
one out of seven jobs in Michi-
gan is a result of commerce with
Canada. Jones said this statistic
indicates the bridge's potential
effect on Southeast Michigan.
"It has to be built," he said.
"There's no choice."
COFFEE

lose its charm. It's such a great
place to be."
Comet Coffee's "coffee-
focused" mentality sets the
shop apart from competitors,
Saborio said.
"All our selections are based
on taste and quality of the cof-
fee," he said.
While Saborio said he pre-
fers Costa Rican coffees, the
most popular drinks at his
caf6 include cappuccinos and
espresso.
Though Comet Coffee is not
a Fair Trade Certified organi-
zation, Saborio said he believes
in the ethics of coffee so his
cafe only buys from roasters
committed to treating farmers
fairly.
"We have focused on find-

ing roasters that tie their own
success to the success of the
farmers," Saborio said. "I really
want to deal with the roasters

Snyder and other advocates of
the project have also pushed for
the construction of the bridge
due to the flourishing commerce
between Michigan and Canada,
which has proposed to pay a
$550 million share of any inter-
national bridge project. Accord-
ing to a report Snyder released
in September, Canada is Michi-
gan's largest trade partner with
$62 billion in trade in 2010 - a
40-percent increase over 2009.
The project would also create
10,000 temporary construction
jobs and would generate or pre-
serve 25,000 jobs in Michigan
through 2035, according to the
report.
"Reinventing Michigan to
become a world trading center
means developing an infrastruc-
ture that will meet the modern
day demands of an international
economy," Snyder wrote in the
proposal to the senate. "This
project has the potential to
return Michigan to the promi-
nence it held for most of the last
century."
However, Jones said he is
concerned about the age of the
Ambassador Bridge - which
opened in 1929 - and Moroun's
ownership of it.
*"He could decide to sell it
next week, and he could sell it
to somebody who's very friendly
with China or Iran," he said.
"That really concerns me. What
if they decide to shut it down for
six months and cut off all of our
commerce?"
Moroun has offered to fund
an addition to the Ambassador
Bridge, which Murray supports
since it comes at no risk to tax-
payers. But Snyder has insisted
on the bridge construction being
a public project since he first
endorsed the New International
Trade Crossing in January.
Despite the Senate's appre-
hension, Snyder spokesman
Ryan Kazmirzack said the
governor would continue to
push for the project, though he
declined to comment on how
Snyder would do so.
"We're still committed to
working on this," Kazmirzack
said. "We've had a setback, but
we are looking for quick action.
This is a project that is very
important."
who are focused on quality."
Saborio said this can some-
times be difficult to attain
because the Fair Trade certi-
fication sets high standards -
like forming cooperatives - for
farmers. However, he said find-
ing roasters who are committed
to assisting farmers is neces-
sary since they often produce
higher quality coffee.
Saborio said Ann Arbor is the
perfect city for Comet Coffee,
and many of his regular cus-
tomers are University students
and faculty.
"It's a lot of graduate stu-
dents (and) professors - not

HEALTH CARE
From Page 1A
members quit smoking and fol-
low a healthy nutrition plan for
University employees.
In his speech yesterday, Dasch-
le praised the V-BID methodology
for its emphasis on wellness.
"I think it's critical that we
remain innovative," Daschle
said. "V-BID is probably the best
illustration of extraordinary
innovation, and therein lies our
secret. We've always been inno-
vative people."
After Daschle's speech, Uni-
versity President Mary Sue

Coleman gave a few remarks
about the University's Center for
V-BID and its influence.
"I look forward to all sorts of
innovations in how we approach
health services research and
translate that research into
real health policy for all Ameri-
cans," Coleman said. "The con-
cept of Value-Based Insurance
Design is a Michigan idea born
through collaboration between
our schools of public health and
medicine."
To ensure equality in health
care systems, Daschle said the
public needs to be more aware of
what is going on in Washington.
Specifically, he said constituents

should know who their senators
and representatives are so they
can give their input to changes
in health care policy.
During a brief period for
questions that followed Cole-
man's and Daschle's speeches,
Coleman asked Daschle about
universal insurance forms,
which will begin in 2013, that
are designed to help streamline
health care costs.
"We might be able to get rid
of the millions of people we have
trying to figure out the insur-
ance forms and fill them out,"
Coleman said.
Daschle said he wants Univer-
sity students to know that they

need to educate themselves on
the issues of health care reform
so they can actively participate
in policy discussions.
"Your generation is by far the
most effected by what happens,"
Daschle said. "It may seem dis-
tant, and it may seem unrelated,
but it is a very serious mistake to
think that you're not going to be
affected by these decisions."
On Monday, the United States
Supreme Court decided to hear a
challenge to President Obama's
2010 health care overhaul law.
The Supreme Court slated oral
arguments to be finished by
March and a decision tobe made
in late June.


GALAXIES

The two galaxies are the far-

any dwarf galaxy previously dis-

Bell and Slater's findings are

to find, but writing the paper and
verifying their findings took sev-
eral months.

not following its agreement of
ending the violence against dem-
onstrators.
At the beginning of the vigil,
crowd members tied their hands
and covered their mouths with
tape to symbolize the repression
of Assad's government.
LSA senior Abbas Alawieh,
education chair of SAFE, said
the protest was designed to show
support for the Syrian protest-
ers and recognize the sacrifices
that the "martyrs" have already
made.
"The people of Syria are upris-

is quite fast," Bell said. "We had
some other candidates, too, that
were a lot less obvious, and we're
still actually trying to chew on
those and figure out what's going
on."
The discovery of the galaxies
is aiding the analysis of dark mat-
ter in the night sky. Because dark
matter does not emit or scatter
light, it has mass but is not detect-
able by the human eye.
Models indicate that there
should be thousands of dark mat-
ter halos surroundingAndromeda,
and dwarf galaxies are indica-
ing for increased freedoms,
demanding justice, demanding
that they have a say in determin-
ing who governs them and what
goes on in their country," Abbas
said. "We're here to show our
solidarity with those cries for
freedom."
After the moment of silence,
the group formed a circle in the
center of the Diag to share per-
sonal experiences and feelings
about the protest. Many attend-
ees had stories like Ghalawanji's
and were from Syria or have fam-
ily members in the country. How-
ever, a majority of those present
were not of Syrian descent.

tors of those halos. With Bell and
Slater's discoveries, only 29 halos
have been found - suggesting that
some of the halos don't have stars
in them or that the models are
wrong.
"This is one of the big reasons
why one does this," Bell said. "If
none of those models can fit the
observations, you may be backed
into the corner where you have
to accept that there are just a lot
less dark matter halos than you
imagined, and then you've learned
something very exciting about
dark matter halos."
power in Syria and how he once
viewed it. When Kherallah was 9
years old and still living in Syria,
Bashar al-Assad's father, Hafez
AI-Assad, died.
"My entire life I had been
brought up with a picture of
(Hafez) in front of me," Kheral-
lah said. "So when (Hafez) died, I
went up to my dad, and I was like
'How is it that (Hafez) has died?'
I had seen so many pictures of
(Hafez) that I thought he was a
prophet."
Alawieh said SAFE has been
mainly focused on Palestine, but
in light of the Arab Spring, they
have broadened their goals to
supportjustice, freedom and self-
determination worldwide.
"We recognize that wherever

stars. Scientists predict that the
sun will become a Red Giant at the
end of its life when it no longer has
a hydrogen-burning core.
Once a cluster of stars is found
it must be verified as a dwarf gal-

oppression and tyranny, it is
obligatory on us to make sure we
add our voice to their voices ... to
make sure their cries for justice
are heard," Alawieh said.
Both of Ghalawanji's parents
were born in Syria, and she has
traveled to Syria every year to
visit family and friends. But for
the moment, Ghalawanji is trying
to keep abreast of news on her
friend who wrote the poem.
"I'm trying to get more infor-
mation from him, but I'm trying
to keep him as safe as possible
because everything is monitored
there," Ghalawanji said.

Bing says concessions vital*
to avoid financial takeover

State may appoint
Detroit financial
manager if fiscal
problems not solved
DETROIT (AP) - Detroit
Mayor Dave Bing yesterday urged
municipal unions to accept wage
cuts and Michigan leaders to pay
the city millions stemming from a
decade-old tax agreement, saying
Detroit needs the money to avoid
an emergency financial takeover.
The city faces a $45 million
cash shortfall by the end of its
fiscal year in June, Bing said in a
TV and radio address. If Detroit
doesn't fix its fiscal problems,
the state could appoint a finan-
cial manager to make sweeping
changes.
Bing's administration has said
Detroit has an accumulated defi-
cit about $150 million in its $3.1

billion annual budget.
"Simply put, our city is in a
financial crisis and city gov-
ernment is broken," Bing said.
"That's not new. That's not an
opinion. That is a fact. I prom-
ised when I ran for this office that
I'd tell you the truth, even when
it wasn't pretty or popular. The
reality we're facing is simple. If
we continue down the same path,
we will lose the ability to control
our own destiny."
A state law passed in March
gives state-appointed financial
managers more power when fix-
ing the finances of municipalities
and school districts. Michigan
already has emergency manag-
ers in place in the Detroit public
school system as well as the cit-
ies of Pontiac, Ecorse and Benton
Harbor.
In his address, Bing repeated
his call for unionized workers to
accept a 10 percent wage cut, al10
percentincrease in employee pay-

ments for health insurance and
changes in work rules. He said
the worker concessions would
save Detroit $40 million for the
fiscal year.
"This is not an attack on labor
or our dedicated employees," he
said. "The private sector, includ-
ing the auto industry was forced
to accept tough cuts to survive."
Bing also wants $220 million
from the Legislature and Gov.
Rick Snyder that stems from a tax
agreementwiththestate. Bingsaid
the state failed to keep a bargain
to maintain state revenue sharing
in exchange for the city's cut in
income tax rates a decade ago.
Snyder, a Republican, said he
remains committed to reviving
Detroit's fortunes, in cooperation
with Bing, a Democrat elected in
a nonpartisan race. Snyder said
he continues to seek to avoid the
appointment of an emergency
financial manager for the city of
713,000 "if at all possible."

Two bullets shot by
21 year old struck
White House
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
man with an apparent obsession
with President Barack Obama
has been arrested in Pennsylva-
nia after the Secret Service dis-
covered two bullets struck the
White House while the presi-
dent was away, authorities said
yesterday.
One bullet smashed into a
window of the living quarters of
the executive mansion but was
stopped by ballistic glass.
The arrest of Oscar Ramiro
Ortega-Hernandez, 21, came
days after reports of shots fired
on Friday night near the White
House while Obama and his wife
Michelle were on a trip to Cali-
fornia and Hawaii. The president
has since traveled on to Austra-
lia, second stop on a nine-day
Asia-Pacific tour, and the White
House had no comment on the
unfoldiggevents.

The U.S. Secret Service said it
discovered Tuesday that the two
bullets hit the White House. U.S.
Park Police had earlier linked
Ortega, a 21-year-old man from
Idaho Falls, Idaho, to the reports
of gunfire.
A U.S. Park Police crime bulle-
tin issued before Ortega's arrest
said he is known to have mental
health issues, adding "Ortega
should be considered unstable
with violent tendencies."
Authorities are investigating
his mental health and say there
are indications he believed his
attack on the White House was
part of a personal mission from
God, according to a law enforce-
ment official. There are also
indications the man had become
obsessed with Obama and the
White House, according to two
officials, who spoke on the con-
dition of anonymity because the
investigation is ongoing.
Authorities said the bul-
lets discovered Tuesday by the
Secret Service have not been
conclusively connected with
the reports of gunfire near the

White House on Friday night.
On Friday, authorities found
an abandoned vehicle with an
assault rifle inside.
Ortega, 21, was arrested yes-
terday afternoon at a hotel near
Indiana, Pa., some 55 miles east
of Pittsburgh, the Secret Service
said. He was in Pennsylvania
State Police custody. A tip from
someone who saw and identified
Ortega led to his arrest, Secret
Service spokesman George Ogil-
vie said.
Ortega did not resist arrest,
said Pennsylvania State Trooper
Lt. Brad Shields. State troopers
said Ortega had visited the hotel
in recent days, and investigators
believed he was back in the area
yesterday. The Secret Service
passed out photographs, and a
desk clerk recognized his pic-
ture and stalled him while noti-
fying police.
Ortega's first court appear-
ance is scheduled Thurs-
day afternoon in Pittsburgh,
according to the staff of U.S.
Magistrate Judge Cynthia Reed
Eddy.

standards.

Elmblad, Ryan emerge
as unheralded heroes

TODD NEEDLE/Daily

Sophomore forward Evan Smotrycz has scored a total of 27 points as a starter in Michigan's first two games of the 2011-12 campaign.

Blue looks for complete effort

By MATT SPELICH
Daily Sports Writer
While the game of basketball
would be nothing without the
stars that helped shape it, there
is something to be said for the
complemen-
tary players Utah at

For the
Michigan TV/Radio:
women's bas-
ketball team,
those players are junior guard
Jenny Ryan and freshman guard
Nicole Elmblad.
Ryan is a returning starter
renowned by teammates and
coaches as a hard worker who
has the talent to create oppor-
tunities for her teammates.
On Monday in a game against
Florida Atlantic, Ryan racked up
nine steals, eight assists and four
rebounds to lead the Wolverines
to victory after trailing in the
first half.
"Jenny makes a lot of things
happen," said Michigan coach
Kevin Borseth. "She's got really
fast hands, always tryingto make
her teammates better, and she's
got the ability to shoot it. She's a
tough kid, a tireless worker and I
think the kids feed off of that.
"I think good players create
and do things for themselves,
but great players make the play-
ers around them better. I think
Jenny is one of those players."
While Ryan had the steals
and assists locked down, Elm-
blad led the team in rebounding,
grabbing a total of seven boards
for the Wolverines. While her
four points and three assists
went relatively unnoticed, Elm-
blad filled a very important role
for the Wolverines on the glass.
This complementary style of play
seem st tb e miut watBorseth

ordered.
"(Elmblad) really melds in
well with the other players,"
Borseth said. "Everything she
does seems to flow with the rest
of them. If her teammates aren't
where they are supposed to be,
she knows to get to that spot.
She knows how to move offen-
sively, and defensively she is very
smart, and makes great deci-
sions. She's a strong-willed kid,
which is hard to teach."
Borseth is a huge advocate
of rebounding and going hard
after the ball. It's clear that he's
imparting these skills well onto
his young players, who see these
skills as a top priority going into
Thursday's matchup against
Utah.
"We're planning to go out
and not let up on the boards,"
Elmblad said. "We can't afford
to take any possessions off. This
game is going to come down
to everyone making the effort
to grah rehounds, hoth on the
offensive and defensive ends."
Aside from its strong rebound-
ing, Utah demonstrated its abili-
ty to put points on theboard with
its 74-60 victory over Southern
Utah last Monday. Borseth and
Ryan are convinced that the
game will come down to much
more than justrebounding.
"Defensively, Utah is very
stingy and offensively they are
very pointed," Borseth said.
"They know exactly what they
want to do, they take care of the
ball, they are spreadbutstrategic
at the same time. They are ateam
that really controls the pace on
offense and mucks it up with
their great one-on-one skills on
defense. It's going to be a chal-
lenge for us."
Those inside looks will likely
go to the hot hands of the team's
leading scorers, junior center
Rachel Sheffer and senior guard
Courtney Boylan, but it's impor-
tant to remember where those
passes are coming from. Those
players - the Ryans and the
Elmblads of the program - are
who Michigan will rely on when

first few contests have been "When we drive, good things

happen," said sophomore for-
ward Evan Smotrycz. "We've got
guys who can get to the rim and
plenty of guys who can shoot it. I
think the game will get a lot eas-
ier if we don't just start shooting
threes right away.
"We've got to get the easy
baskets, the transition baskets,
(and) work on getting two feet in
the paint."
But Smotrycz hasn't been the
problem. The Reading, Mass.
native has put his added weight
to good use this season. In a
stark contrast from last year,
just nine of his 27 points so far
have come from 3-pointers. Last
season, Smotrycz was often con-
tent to hang on the perimeter
and fire from deep - this year
he's shown an affinity to scrap
around the basket and score off
cuts, adding new dimensions to
his game.
"Evan's points (against Tow-
son) were a great step," said
Michigan coach John Beilein. .
"None of them were pretty, but
he just found ways to get the ball
in the basket. That's a big step
for him."
Beilein said that the team
needs to score more points from
"just executing our offense,"
as much of Michigan's produc-

tion has come from transition
opportunities off defensive
stops. Those fast-break chances
won't come with as much con-
sistency against tougher oppo-
nents, meaning the Wolverines
have to develop more flow to
their offense - particularly
with freshman point guard Trey
Burke now poised to run the
team full-time.
Western Illinois, which
Beilein called a solid defensive
team, presents a good oppor-
tunity to do so. The Fighting
Leathernecks fell at Dayton,
87-58, making the coach's words
ring a little hollow, but the team
was down just three points at
halftime.
Again, though the team may
not say it, Michigan should have
no problem dispatching Western
Illinois on Thursday. The true
challenge for the Wolverines is
to come through with a complete
effort in preparation for what
lies ahead.
"(It's about) just playing the
whole 40 minutes on the defen-
sive end," Hardaway Jr. said.
"Trying to be a top-ranked
team, or trying to be up there
with the top-ranked teams,
you can't you do that. You can't
slack off."

Hoke addresses Robinson's fumbles at QB

By KEVIN RAFTERY
Daily Sports Editor
According to Michigan offen-
sive coordinator Al Borges,
there was one way the Michi-
gan football team could have
"screwed it up" against Illinois
last Saturday - by fumbling the
ball.
For the most part, the 22nd-
ranked Wolverines held onto
the ball just
fine en route NOTEBOOK
to a 31-14 vic-
tory. But there was one player
Borges noted - junior quarter-
back Denard Robinson - who
fumbled twice in the first half.
Often this season, Borges has
been asked about Robinson's
difficulties throwing the ball.
During his Tuesday press con-
ference, it was a different story.
"The issues with Denard, I
think, were pretty much ball
security deals," Borges said.
"Other than that, he didn't real-
ly throw the ball too bad."
On a 2nd-and-5 play late in
the first quarter, Robinson kept
the ball after play-action, run-
ning into a swarm of Illinois
defenders. The three Fighting
Illini just ripped the ball out of
his hands.
"There was a lot of pulling
and scratching, all that kind
of stuff," said Michigan coach
Brady Hoke of the play. "The
guy hits the ball right and you're
trying to get some extra yards or
you're trying to make a play, and
you lapse a little bit in your ball
security."
Later in the second quarter,
Robinson dropped back to pass
and was pancaked by a pair of

Illinois defenders, sending the
ball flying in the air and squash-
ing an opportunity for Michigan
to build on its 14-0 lead.
Borges said Robinson needs
to be more aware of when he's
about to get hit in the pocket.
"We have to keep the ball
inside the perimeter of your
shoulders, so that you naturally
brace when you get hit," Borges
said.
Robinson also had a costly
fumble two weeks ago in the
24-16 loss to Iowa when he
held the ball with one hand as
a Hawkeye defender pressured
him. Falling to the ground, Rob-
inson tried to keep his balance
but lost the ball as his hands hit
the turf.
"He got the ball away from his
body one time when he was run-
ning," Borges said. "You usually
fumble when you're fundamen-
tally bad.'You don't keep the ball
with five points of pressure, and
it gets away from your body and
somebody strips it."
Robinson's struggles to hold
onto the ball also played a fac-
tor in deciding to keep him on
the bench in favor of sophomore
Devin Gardner with Robinson
hurt.
Borges said he would have
"put (Robinson) back in a min-
ute," but he and the coaching
staff were concerned Robinson
would have even more trouble
holding onto the ball with his
injured wrist.
Despite Robinson's three
fumbles in two games, Borges
and the coaching staff remain
confident in Robinson - who is
healthy and will start this Sat-
urday against Nebraska - and

his ability to run and hold onto
the ball.
"He's featured as a runner in
our offense and will continue to
be featured as a runner," Borges
said. "He's been pretty good
running the ball, taking care of
the ball."
BRADY HOKE, QUARTER-
BACK: On Saturday, Michigan
will be facing one of the bet-
ter mobile quarterbacks in the
nation in Nebraska's Taylor
Martinez, who is third in the Big
Ten in total offense, behind only
Robinson and Wisconsin quar-
terback Russell Wilson.
Luckily for the Wolverines,
they have the perfect scout team
quarterback to prepare for the
speedy Martinez - Brady Hoke.
"I become the scout team
quarterback on walk-throughs,"
Hoke said. "I run the offense.
We'll have a walk-through Sat-
urday morning. I'll be a big part
of that.
"I was a really good quarter-
back at one time."
Says who?
"Ido," Hoke said. "But I never
played quarterback. I was a
blocking fullback."
Though Hoke will lead
the offense in vigorous walk-
throughs on Saturday, Michigan
does indeed have the perfect
quarterback to prepare for Mar-
tinez in practice this week.
Statistically, Robinson is one
spot ahead of Martinez in nearly
every offensive category, and
features a similar skill set.
CARR TO BE HONORED:
Former Michigan coach Lloyd
Carr is set for induction into the
National Football Foundation
and College Football College

Football Hall of Fame on Dec.
6, and he will be honored with
a pregame ceremony in Michi-
gan Stadium on Saturday.
Hoke, who was an assistant
coach under Carr from 1995-
2001, had nothing but praise
for the former coach.
"I thought Lloyd handled
the team as well as anybody
I've been around," Hoke said.
"I think that's probably the big-
gest thing. (He) wasn't always
(that) nice - there's some
tough love in there.
"I think that's always been
a part of who I am, but I think
you get some affirmation when
you see the success that some-
one else has doing it that way."
Saturday is also Military
Appreciation Day at the Big
House, and Carr's ceremony is
one of several events planned
before the game, including a
card stunt that will involve the
fans.
Because of the pregame
plans, the Athletic Department
is asking that fans get to the
game early.
NOTES: Redshirt junior
offensive lineman Ricky Bar-
num, who has missed the last
two games with an ankle inju-
ry, will be available on Satur-
day, but Hoke said he's unsure if
Barnum will play. ... Fifth-year
senior safety Troy Woolfolk,
who hurt his leg last week, will
play at full strength against the
Cornhuskers. ... If Michigan -
which is 4-2 in conference play
- wins on Saturday, it could
help 5-1 Michigan State win
the Legends Division of the Big
Ten. "Doesn't matter," Hoke
said. "We care about winning."

Fifth-year senior defensive end Ryan Van Bergen has exploded with 13 tackles, five tackles for loss and 2.5 sacks in Michigan's past three games.

hand out the scouting reports.
Van Bergen usually finds the ten-
dencies and play consistencies
watching film on his own. Some-
times he's right, and sometimes
Montgomery has to straighten
him out. The answers are always
in the binder. In practice, the
scout team gives the defense
simulations of what they'll see in
the game.
"It goes from there to the
game," Montgomery said. "'Hey
Coach, this holds up. Every time
they do this, it's accurate.' Then
they start to believe."
One of Montgomery's first

disciples was Van Bergen. He
bought in early on, took the time
to study and took it upon himself
to know where everyone else was
on the field and what his role was
in the grand scheme. Montgom-
ery calls it knowing where he
"fits" in the defense.
Van Bergen knew Iowa was
going to sneak its quarterback
when it hurried up to the line on
a fourth-and-1 two weeks ago -
he and Martin snuffed it out.
The past three weeks in par-
ticular, Montgomery said, Van
Bergen has been well versed in
the opponent's "meat and pota-

toes" (Hoke's term for tenden-
cies and key plays). No wonder
they've been his best three
weeks of the season - 13 tackles,
five tackles for loss and 2.5 sacks.
Van Bergen didn't know if the
free-wheeling audibles would
continue, but it wouldn't be sur-
prising, considering how com-
fortable everyone is with the
defense now. As Martin put it,
"It's something that, it'll come
with time. And the time has
come."
It took time to get here. The
technique drilled during fall
camp is used to beat opponent's

specific strategies. Film study
was emphasized, and Van Ber-
gen's now yelling out opposing
team's plays. The engine is hum-
ming.
"Sometimes, you've got teams
and they've got to be thinking,
'Man, how do they know what
we're going to do before we even
do it,' " Martin said. "And I can't
imagine as an offense how that
would even feel. If the defense
knows what you're doing and
they're able to execute it, that's
got to be disheartening.
"We can do that because we
put in the time."

Second line provides offensive spark behind pair of Clydesdales

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan hockey team's
top-scoring line pairs freshman
forward Phil Di Giuseppe with
two Clydesdales.
Bear with Michigan coach Red
Berenson as he gets a little meta-
phoric.
"They had these Clydesdale
horses, and they said they could
each pull 10,000 pounds," Beren-
son said. "But together they
could pull 30,000 pounds. Now
how could that be? But it's true,
it's a fact. It's a little bit like hock-
ey players. If you get two players
really playing well together, they
could be much better than they
were as individuals."
The identity of the unnamed
"they" - the ones conduct-
ing these horse experiments
- remains unclear. But the two
Clydesdales on the hockey team?
That's easy: junior forwards
Chris Brown and A.J. Treais.
So what's Di Giuseppe? Well,
he's a little harder to peg.
"Phil's in his own world,"
Treais teased.
Added Brown: "Phil's Phil.
He's kind of doing whatever he
needs to do to get by right now."
Whatever he's doing is work-
ing. Berenson said that his sec-
ond line - consisting of Treais,
Brown and Di Giuseppe - has
become the "offensive spark" for
the team.
They rank second, third and
fourth, respectively, on the

man back there," Di Giuseppe said.
Like the Clydesdales, the line
has pulled more than its own
weight because of chemistry.
Treais and Di Giuseppe say that
they know where the other will
be on the ice at all times. They've
become familiar with each oth-
er's routes, to the point where if
they just call the other's name,
they can expect a puck on the
tape.
The level of chemistry is a bit
surprising - for one, the three
don't exactly come from typi-
cal hockey backgrounds. Treais
is Filipino, Brown is a Texan
and the pair will tell you that Di
Giuseppe is Italian, though he's
actually from Canada.
And Di Giuseppe doesn't seem
like he'd jell with the pair of
jovial roommates he plays along-
side.
Brown and Treais speak well
and are prone to joking when
they're together. Di Giuseppe
isn't comfortable in interviews.
He says all the right things -
about trying to improve and
becoming a two-way hockey
player - but his mind often
seems to be elsewhere.
Once, Di Giuseppe started
chuckling in the middle of a ques-
tion, for reasons unknown even
to him.
"It's easy," Di Giuseppe began
one answer. "What was I going
to say? I don't know what I was
going to say."
Not so easy, eh?
"Speak, man!" Brown inter-

jected.
"I forgot what I was going to
say," Di Giuseppe said.
Berenson hesitates to crown
the line as the go-to unit when
the team needs to score - he said
that once he does that, the line
will probably hita dry spell.
Though the trio does score
frequently, the goals often come
from deflections, rebounds and
just putting the puck onnet - not
what you'd expect out of a talent-
ed scoring line.
"The goals they've scored are
kind of lucky goals," Berenson
said. "It's not like they're flashy
goals or real skilled goals, even
though that line is pretty skilled."
But maybe that's not a bad
thing. Di Giuseppe said the line
tries to do the simple things,
and that often leads to positive
results.
At Miami (Ohio) on Saturday,
a Treais check created a turnover
and allowed Di Giuseppe to get
off a shot. He didn't score, but
Brown converted onthe rebound.
"(It) wasn't the prettiest goal,"
Di Giuseppe said. "Most of our
goals aren't highlight-reel goals.
All of our goals, I think, have
been hard work down in the cor-
ners, working it out."
True, it wasn't the prettiest
goal, and the three don't make 0
the typical trio.
But together, they've become
Michigan's main source of
offense, greater than the sum of
its parts - just like those Clydes-
dales.

FOOD WARS
Each week, one Ann Arbor staple menu item becomes a
battlefield as Daily Arts editors butt heads over
which restaurant makes it best.
SOMETHING PUMPKIN

PUMPKIN PIE LATTE
Espresso Royale
324 South State Street
This isn't just some paltry pumpkin
spice latte - no, this is the real McCoy.
The coffee crafters at Espresso Royale add
condensed milk to lend a certain thick-
ness to the drink. With sweet aumtumnal
tones blending into the creamy texture,
this is the only pumpkin pie you can drink
through a straw.
PUMPKIN BAGEL & CREAM CHEESE
Bagel Fragel
1760 Plymouth Road
A short walk from the Bursley bus stop
on the last frontier of campus lies a quaint
bagel shop. Bagel Fragel houses a pump-
kin flavor explosion so intense that fallout
shelters are required nearby. A pumpkin
bagel base poses no threat to anyone's
canine teeth while pumpkin cream cheese
melts away like ice on an Arctic glacier.

PUMPKIN PECAN CHEESECAKE
CafieAmbrosia
326 Maynard Street
A bite of Cafe Ambrosia's pumpkin
pecan cheesecake is a treat no matter what
it includes - the moistly bready crust, the
cinnamon-topped sweet pecans or that
unbelievably pumpkin-y, cheesy interior.
Anyone staying in Ann Arbor for Thanks-
giving need only stop here fortheir squash-
spiked dessert.
PUMPKIN PIE ICE CREAM
Ben &T Jerry's
304 South State Street
Close your eyes and taste it: A frozen
treat served in thick scoops, rich with
pumpkin-y flavor. The signature Ben &
Jerry's treat has liberal amounts of pie
crust morsels folded into the creamy
mixture, and each bite inspires satisfac-
tion. This flavor is a limited edition - it
only comes out once a year. So there's no
excuse not to get it while you can.

If the E3W and the Gargoyle were involved in a gladiator fight,
who would win?
Probably the Gargoyle because it has the meat.
"Cabaret" is happening this weekend.
I know, I'm going.
Have you seen the show before?
This will be my first time, so I'm excited.
Do you enjoy anything that's pumpkin flavored?
Pumpkin spice lattes at Starbucks are the bomb. They can't be
beaten, except by their white chocolate peppermint mochas.

D T- VAT 'LET'S GET FREE' (2000), DEAD PREZ
Occupying the airwaves

By CASSIE BALFOUR
Daily Community CultureEditor
Dead Prez's album Let's Get
Free isn't easy listening. The
beats aren't polished, the pro-
duction isn't incredibly inno-
vative, the duo's rhymes aren't
approachable and they don't give
a shit about swag. But stic.man
and M-1 wouldn't want to be
radio friendly or become part of
the hip hop-industrial complex
they so aggressively disdain.
Let's Get Free isn't just a hip-
hop record. It's a manifesto for
the amateur revolutionary look-
ing to overthrow the capitalist
pigs standing in the way of the
struggle for freedom. At the turn
of the millennium, the rap group
was mad as hell and screaming
about structural inequality.
When I first listened to Dead
Prez, I was struck by the group's
militancy, unapologetic anger
and complete rejection of the
commercialism - not just of hip
hop (which is just a symptom of
something deeper) but of Ameri-
can culture in general.
Maybe it's just because my
least favorite holiday, Black Fri-
day, is fast approaching - that
great tradition of mouth-breath-
ers stampeding fellow humans
in order to continue on that
never-ending quest for another
flat-screen television. Or maybe
because Jay-Z hustled to capi-
talize on Occupy Wall Street
by selling "Occupy All Streets"
T-shirts (with none of the prof-
its going to the cause), but Dead
Prez seems to have the antidote
to vapid hip hop.
On perhaps the most suc-
cessful trock, "It's Bigger Than
Hip Hop," Dead Prez raps over
a scrambled beat about the
restraints of the music industry
and the "fake thug, R&B, rap
scenario all day on the radio."
It almost seems prophetic that
Dead Prez is condemning the
glamorization of the thug life
and decadence pervading the
radio from over a decade ago.
The group's thesis statement
seems to be contained in this
track: "You would rather have

a Lexus or justice? / A dream or
some substance? / A Beamer, a
necklace or freedom?"
The album has gritty tracks
that should be played in a dingy
basement. Even the most stoic of
hipsters won't be able to resist
the uncomfortable frankness
and infectious camaraderie the
rap group manages to create on

According to Brenna Field, cur- -I8
rent Editor in Chief of the Every

the most effective ways to raise
awareness about important issues
in the college community because
many young adults don'thave time
to read straight news stories or

"It does make them think about

name on something that repre-
sents an opinion that you don't
have," she said.
In this way, writers can take
their pieces to any and all extremes
without worrying about the arti-
cle being connected with their
personal views. The anonymity
allows them to reach a large audi-
ence through fictitious personas.
According to Rosen, The Gar-
goyle is also making an effort to
cater to a larger portion of the
student population, a motion
aided by the publication's recent
expansion from eight staff mem-
bers to nearly 40.
"We've definitely gone through
some changes in the last few
years," Rosen said. "We've moved
away from esoteric, weird humor
- god, I sound like a fucking ass-
hole - to 'campus humor. (The
Gargoyle) used to be in a rut -
frankly the Every Three Weekly
was more relevant then. We used
to be a niche humor market, but
that's changed a lot."
Contributions from a diverse
staff for the Every Three Weekly
allow the publication to be acces-
sible to many University students.
Petrich said the publication's pop-
ularity and humor have triggered
mfnyto join itssadff.
"Wehave jocks and frat bros,we
have Kerrytown-type RC kids, we
have totally normal, meat-eating
sports fans and music nerds," Pet-
rich said. "We hadsorority girls
applying but we also have people
who abhor sorority girls applying."
The commitment to the acces-
sibility of humor will allow pub-
lications like the E3W and The
Gargoyle to continue cracking
jokes students will want to read
because there are simply less limi-
tations and more ways to whack
the funny bone ofthe student body.
"I think we'll stick around,"
Field said. "As long as we keep
thinking of ways to engage the
campus community and not recy-
cle jokes, we'll be funny and we'll
be here."

VINYL VICTORY

Encore Records survives on second chance

How the A2 record store
staple is keeping up
after ownership shuffle
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily Arts Writer
Nowadays, the moment a new song or
album is released, the natural instinct
is to log on to iTunes, download it and
enjoy. But listeners still need some-
thing real to hold, something tangible,
something timeless. They need a vinyl
record.
Ann Arbor's record store community
nearly lost a member last summer when
the owner of Encore Records on East
Liberty retired, leaving music aficiona-
dos unsure of the shop's future.
But then two employees stepped up
and took over ownership in order to
ensure the store's continued existence.
Back in July, Bill McClelland and Jim
Dwyer decided they couldn't let Encore
disappear after the original owner
announced his retirement. This deci-
sion might seem like quite an undertak-
ing, but surprisingly McClelland and
Dwyer didn't think it was a big deal at all.
Records had become their life and they

couldn't imagine doing anything else.
What started as a learning experi-
ence quickly became a way of life for the
employees, who are passionate about
keeping vinyl alive within the music
community.
"You can feel the grooves," employee
Michael Dykehouse said. "(Records are)
a piece of history in some ways. It's tan-
gible, and I think there will always be a
place in the market for them-- they're
tiny art objects."
Employee Dustin Krcatovich said it
was unfortunate that more record stores
don't stick around for both the custom-
ers' and employees' benefit.
"You learn so much right away (work-
ing in a record store), and you learn that
you'll never know everything," he said.
"It knocks any know-it-all tendencies
out of you. It may be trivial, but it can be
enriching, too."
Dwyer said having a store like Encore
disappear would be detrimental to the
community because the store establish-
es a powerful connection between the
music and the customers, newcomers
and regulars alike.
"Musical memories are one of peo-
ple's strongest memories," Dwyer said.
"Maybe music is about more than just
the song itself, it's the whole culture of

the people who follow music."
McClelland said there are customers
who bring their children into their store
to "start them young," hoping they'll
catch the vinyl record bug. He said
when he was a kid, he loved being able
to stare at the covers.
"It's more visual," McClelland said.
"It's something you can hold. It's like art
you can hold in your hands."
Encore is also home to regulars who
stay loyal to the store to find certain
records or just to spend hours talking
with the staff about music.
Amy Stillman, a longtime customer,
has been shopping at Encore since she
moved to Ann Arbor in 1998 and became
a self-described "hardcore vinyl collec-
tor" in 2004. Stillman comes into the
store roughly four to five times a year,
usually leaving with an irreplaceable
sense of satisfaction and $100 worth of
records.
"(Encore) is a record collector's nir-
vana," Stillman said. "It's just a lot of
fun to come in and look at all of this and
the potential it represents."
Regardless of modern technologies,
the power of the Internet and easy
access to digital media, employees at
Encore feel these options can't replace

Encore Records faced the prospect of closing in July, before employees took ownership of the shop.

ch said music becomes a part of the Ann
Arbor community.
"A record store is like a field you can
run around in and go from place to
place," Krcatovich said. "I think that's

why a town like Ann Arbor, or any town
at all, benefits from having stores like
(Encore). You can look around, find
what you like and in a way, that's more
organic and ultimately more satisfying."


The fictional Kit Kat Klub sets the scene for the 1966 musical "Cabaret."

CABARET
From Page 1B
cabaret in the late 19th century in Mont-
martre - then a small town outside Paris.
At first the cabaret acted solely as a gath-
ering place for Salis's bohemian friends to
share their poetry and songs. But cabarets
eventually spread throughout Europe,
evolving into more elaborate political
shows and having a big impact on Berlin.
DePuit said these Berlin cabarets were
political and satirical, blending an eccen-
tric fantasy life with what was going on
at the time in the country. Intellectuals
and liberals would attend these shows not
only to learn about what was going on in
Berlin in the early 1900s, but also to poke
fun at the political climate.
MT&D senior Roman Micevic, who
is directing the MUSKET performance,
said "Cabaret" actually parallels the cab-
arets of the past because there would be
performances with a dialogue and a song
or skit that would relate to that scene.
In cabarets, an emcee, or master of
ceremonies, "bookends, transitions and
presents everything" like a narrator,
according to Ryan, who plays the omni-
present, provocative and anonymous
Emcee in the musical.

Cabarets have also evolved into the
simple singer-and-pianist show, in which
the singer takes on the role of the enter-
tainment and the emcee. The lavish cab-
arets of the past were made up of large
orchestras, full ballets and even lantern
shows.
The costumes were made of sequins
and glitter, makeup was heavy but col-
orful and women were scantily clad in
fishnet stockings, garters and bustiers.
The show halls were decorated with
wealthy show-goers in the finest of suits
and dresses. Though cabarets may seem
kitschy and vulgar, they were actually an
elegant place to be.
The musical operates on a similarly
grand scale.

"I think the repercussions of Nazi
Germany and World War II is obviously
something we are still living with," Reed
said. "The mindset of pushing away the
problems of the world and choosing to
ignore it is absolutely relevant today."
She added, "We're always sort of faced
with that choice of accepting who you
are and going with the flow and not wor-
rying about it. ... Or choosing to open our
eyes and view the world and the mess
that it may be."
Devon Perry, MT&D junior and musi-
cal director of "Cabaret," said not only
does the setting of the show cross over to
today, but the music does too.
The composers, John Kander and
Fred Ebb, wrote the music after World
War II, but it reflects the sounds of the
'30s. European oompah-pah horns and
jazzy vocal runs grace the score.
"As soon as you hear it you'll realize
it's not contemporary by any means," she
said.
Perry is planning to bring modernity
to the show while harking back to its era
by using a keyboard to play instruments
that are either out-of-date or hard to
find, like the accordion. The accordion
was one of the main instruments used
in 1930s Berlin, but it was too expensive
and difficult to find one to play for the
production.
Micevic found not only musical rele-
vancy in "Cabaret," but also a connection
to today's politics and economic state.
"It's a timeless tale," he said. "There
are so many parallels to Weimar Germa-
ny and today."
According to Micevic, there's also a
correlation between the rise of the Nazis
in post-World WarI Germany and rise of
the Tea-Party today - he claims a simi-
lar economic situation and scapegoating
tendency.
The musical is also notable for break-
ing the fourth wall and directing com-
mentary toward the audience. This style
is very imitative of the way cabarets are
performed today and were performed in
the past.
"At the end of the evening, the audi-
ence feels that they know you as a person
as well as a performer, so there's no hid-
ing behind a character," DePuit said. "A

good cabaret performer really makes you
feel that you've been sung to directly and
you really know them by the end of the
act. It's a very personal art form."

Maybe This Time
Though it's a social commentary,
"Cabaret" is still a show with lights,
cameras and action. It still involves
deep, fictional characters, direction and
talented actors.
Actors need to dig deep to find a con-
nection to their character. Reed latched
on that connection - and she loved it.
"I sort of feel like Sally is absolutely
this side of me that exists and that I'm
getting to explore," she said. "I was sort
of surprised at how similar we were in
some ways, so I'm just having a lot of fun
playing her."
Ryan, too, feels a personal connection
to the Emcee.
"I have been singing this show in the
shower since I was seven," he said. "It's
really the reason I wanted to be an actor.
... It has been a dream of mine to play
this role forever."
Actors leaving their real lives to
transition into fictional, entertaining
characters resembles how the cabarets
transcribed real life into engaging num-
bers. For the MUSKET actors, this is
just something they do for fun - block
out real life and live in a fantasy world.
But for some, it's a way of living.
"There's this idea of this decadent
sort of dream world that we're living in
today," Micevic said. "We're all plugged
into our own music with our iPods, we
can choose to follow the news, we have a
lot more information through the Inter-
net. It's so much easier for us to ignore
this sort of news, and that's exactly
what this cabaret is all about."
Cabarets put on an air of lightness,
and some people, like Sally Bowles, get
swept up in its charm. But Micevic said
we should open our eyes to what is going
on in front of us and not ignore it.
"We should be aware of this dream
world, this happy-go-lucky place that
we can go to," he said.
This is the essence of "Cabaret," a
show that embraces history and glitzy
escapism but also grounds itself in reali-
ty. This is the life, old chum, of a cabaret.
