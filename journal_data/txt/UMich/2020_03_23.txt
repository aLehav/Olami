All undergraduate courses at 

the University of Michigan will 

transition to an alternative grade 

policy, according to an email sent 

to students from Acting Provost 

Susan Collins on Friday evening. 

In place of a letter grade, students 

will now receive a “Pass” or “No 

Record Covid” on their permanent 

transcripts.

Students who receive a “Pass,” 

or “P,” on their transcript will get 

full credit for the course, with a 

grade cut-off of C-, the traditional 

grade minimum for a student to 

earn course credit. Additionally, 

students who wish for their “P” 

to be converted to a letter grade 

will have the option to do so if 

they submit a request by July 1. 

According to Collins, more details 

regarding the “P” to letter grade 

conversion will be communicated 

in the coming weeks.

Students 
who 
receive 
“No 

Record Covid,” or “NRC,” on their 

transcript will not receive course 

credit, 
but 
their 
grade 
point 

average will not be affected.

Collins wrote the University 

will 
also 
implement 
a 
more 

flexible course withdrawal policy. 

The new policy allows students 

to withdraw from a class up 

until April 21 without the course 

appearing on their transcript. 

The new grading policy will 

also 
apply 
to 
undergraduates 

enrolled 
in 
graduate 
classes; 

however, classes graded before 

March 10 will not be subject to this 

policy. In the email, Collins wrote 

the University plans to share 

additional 
information 
about 

graduate and professional classes 

within the coming week.

“While 
other 
institutions 

across the nation have adopted 

similar policies on grading, it is 

undoubtedly 
an 
unprecedented 

step 
for 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan,” Collins wrote. “But 

these are unprecedented times, 

and I appreciate your flexibility.”

After the first week of transitioning 

to remote learning platforms, some 

University of Michigan students and 

faculty faced scheduling adjustments, 

particularly related to difficulties 

with time zones.

LSA 
sophomore 
Sydney 
Lum 

moved back to her home in Kailua, 

Hawaii. She shared her experience 

with transitioning to online courses 

in Hawaii-Aleutian Standard Time, 

which runs six hours behind Eastern 

Standard Time, the time zone in 

Michigan.

“With the time difference, I’ve 

had to start my classes at four in the 

morning,” Lum said. “So on Monday, 

I had my (sociology) midterm at 

4 (a.m.), and the teacher was like, 

‘Yeah we have to do it all at the same 

time, there’s no exceptions.’ So that’s 

definitely a negative, like waking up 

really early, especially trying to have 

time with my family at night, because 

I have to go to bed really early.”

Lum’s courses currently include 

live discussion sessions, in which 

students call into class through 

online platforms like BlueJeans or 

Zoom. Lum said she thinks these live 

sessions pose challenges in creating 

a similar environment to traditional 

classroom settings.

“I think it’s a bummer for me 

because I love going to classes, and 

I love going to discussion, and it’s 

been really difficult trying to have 

those discussions,” Lum said. “I 

think a lot of people are less likely 

to participate in Bluejeans or Zoom, 

because you can kind of hide behind 

a screen in many ways, so a lot of 

discussion hasn’t been as enjoyable, 

to be honest.”

French professor Sabine Gabaron 

teaches four classes this semester 

and has been testing out various 

platforms this past week to adapt to 

the changing situation. She said the 

department had a discussion about 

how to accommodate students living 

in different time zones.

“Should we change our class time 

to accommodate everyone and try 

to find a middle ground that works 

for everyone?” Gabaron said. “And 

we all came to the conclusion that 

it was impossible because all of our 

students are taking different classes. 

And so as everybody starts moving 

class time all over the place, then 

it becomes more hectic in terms of 

getting organized for everyone. So 

then we decided that it made more 

sense for us if we wanted to teach 

live to teach at our class time, and 

then try to offer other options for 

those who could not join.”

Beginning 
Wednesday 

morning, 
University 
of 

Michigan 
students 
will 

be able to vote for the 

LSA Student Government 

president and vice president. 

The Michigan Daily spoke 

with the candidates of each 

ticket to learn more about 

their past work and their 

platforms.

Ticket 
#1: 
Jordan 

Schuler 
(President) 
and 

Sai Pamidighantam (Vice 

President)

Jordan Schuler is a junior 

majoring in Organizational 

Studies 
and 
Philosophy, 

Politics 
and 
Economics. 

Schuler has been a part of 

LSA SG since his freshman 

year. He said he has used his 

time on LSA SG to build a 

community within student 

government.

Sai 
Pamidighantam 

is a junior majoring in 

Biopsychology, 
Cognition, 

and 
Neuroscience 
with 

minors in applied statistics 

and Gender and Health. 

Pamidighantam has been 

part of the LSA SG for 

three years. She served as 

an associate representative 

and then moved up to be the 

vice chair of the Diversity 

Affairs Committee.

The theme of Schuler and 

Pamidighantam’s platform 

is 
being 
relationship-

driven 
and 
inclusivity-

focused. They said their 

goal 
is 
to 
be 
able 
to 

collaborate with a variety of 

multicultural organizations 

and 
politically-focused 

organizations on campus.

According 
to 
Schuler, 

diversity 
and 
inclusivity 

are at the center of their 

campaign.

“I 
think 
the 
most 

important 
piece 
of 
our 

campaign is that we don’t 

want things like diversity 

and inclusivity to just be 

buzzwords, but to be a 

promise 
and 
something 

that we follow through on,” 

Schuler said. “Something 

that 
we’re 
committing 

to doing for the year to 

come is making people on 

our campus, regardless of 

their background or their 

identities, feel welcome in 

our government and have a 

commitment to projects that 

show that we mean it.”

If they win the election, 

Schuler and Pamidighantam 

hope to create a General 

Learning 
Center, 
where 

students could go to get 

free tutoring in any subject. 

They 
hope 
to 
promote 

transparency with students 

about the costs of courses, 

and would like to continue 

working with the Maize & 

Blue Cupboard. 

Ticket #2: Selena Bazzi 

(President) 
and 
Josiah 

Walker (Vice President)

Selena Bazzi is a junior 

studying 
biomolecular 

science 
with 
a 
double 

minor in Art & Design 

and 
Community 
Action 

and 
Social 
Change. 

Bazzi has been part of 

student government at the 

University for three years. 

Josiah Walker is a junior 

studying political science 

and has not previously been 

involved with LSA SG. 

Bazzi said her time in LSA 

SG working with student 

groups and administration 

has helped her gain a lot of 

knowledge about various 

groups 
and 
institutions 

within the University. 

“I feel like I’ve gained 

unique 
institutional 

knowledge to understand 

how 
the 
University 

functions, where it’s lacking 

and where things are going 

well,” 
Bazzi 
said. 
“And 

my three years of student 

government 
experience 

have given me insight on 

how to make the changes 

that I want on campus.”

Walker chose to take his 

experience throughout his 

three years on campus and 

apply it to the LSA SG.

“I decided to run because 

I’ve been heavily involved 

in other organizing spaces 

on campus,” Walker said. 

“I think merging student 

government 
efforts 
with 

efforts 
made 
by 
other 

organizing 
spaces 
on 

campus will have a much 

more tangible impact on the 

causes that both groups care 

about.”

Bazzi and Walker said 

their platform focuses on 

fostering a more affordable 

university 
through 

resources such as free test 

prep and cheaper textbook 

costs. Bazzi said their goal 

is for finances not to be a 

barrier for students.

“So, in terms of academics, 

we want to promote a 

textbook 
affordability 

initiative,” Walker said. “We 

know that a lot of textbooks 

from some of the upper-

level classes or some of the 

STEM classes and even 

the language classes can 

be costly. I want to work 

with the dean and other 

university 
resources 
to 

figure out how to make the 

material more affordable for 

students.”

COURTEY OF JORDAN SCHULER & SELENA BAZZI 

LSA juniors Jordan Schuler and Sai Pamidighantam are running against LSA juniors Selena Bazzi and Josiah Walker for the positions of president and 
vice president for the LSA Student Government.

Gabaron 
said 
several 

language 
departments 

decided to offer students 

the opportunity to tune into 

live lectures or discussions 

at different section times 

other than their original 

time. This offers students 

who live in different time 

zones a chance to engage 

in 
live 
discussions 
at 

reasonable hours of the day, 

Gabaron explained. 

“As 
the 
schools 

were closing it became 

challenging 
for 
people 

to work from home with 

a new family situation,” 

Gabaron said. “So that was 

also a little bit difficult 

but I think it was great 

because students were very 

much 
understanding 
of 

the instructor’s situation 

and the instructors were 

very understanding of the 

student situation. So I really 

felt that what happened 

this week was very strong 

in terms of emotions, but 

also in terms of bonding 

and understanding of each 

other. ”

LSA 
freshman 
Neil 

Kapadia is from Mumbai, 

India. He said his professors 

have been understanding 

and accommodating for his 

math classes. 

“So far, the transition has 

been quite smooth, it hasn’t 

been as bad as I thought 

it 
would 
have 
been,” 

Kapadia said. “I mean, this 

is obviously not an ideal 

situation, but professors 

are at least trying their best 

to make it the same. For my 

math class, they’ve shared 

the 
worksheets, 
they’ve 

extended 
deadlines, 

and they’ve given us the 

opportunity to collaborate 

with everyone else because 

that’s what math class is 

about.”

However, Kapadia said 

there still remains a barrier 

to attending online office 

hours 
with 
professors 

whose time zones are in a 

country across the globe. 

Eastern Standard Time is 

10 hours and 30 minutes 

behind the time zone in 

Mumbai.

“The only thing I find a 

little tough with the time 

zone is with office hours 

and all, because the timings 

are not going to change,” 

Kapadia 
said. 
“They’ll 

probably 
be 
around 

midnight, but that will be 

okay I guess, for like one or 

two nights to stay up.”


Amidst the chaos of the world, I 

looked up to the sky and witnessed 

a flock of birds carelessly soaring. 

To them it was just another day. The 

outbreak of a virus, cancellation 

of classes, disruption of routine 

meant nothing to the birds as 

they remained unfazed. The birds 

didn’t have to worry about grocery 

store stocks running low, or the 

possibility of losing their jobs. They 

found their versions of toilet paper 

and hand sanitizer in nature. They 

didn’’t worry about how the virus 

would hinder their ability to have 

financial security. The birds placed 

their trust in nature and continued 

to live in unison with it. The only 

structure they followed was that of 

the Earth, and their routine relied 

on the conditions of nature. 

I admired the birds’ autonomy. 

It showed me that a reliance on 

systems had stripped me from my 

ability to live confidently with 

nature. I depended so heavily on 

manmade structures like school 

and work to feel fulfilled. I was so 

out of touch with nature that when 

something natural like a virus 

prevented 
certain 
institutions 

from functioning, I too, felt unable 

to function. I felt that if I was 

not going to school everyday and 

working from morning to night 

that I would not feel satisfied. I 

felt that success was quantified by 

the amount of work I produced for 

those systems and anything that 

stopped me from producing was a 

problem. 

My feelings are foreign to birds 

as the only structure they subscribe 

to is nature. They eat from nature, 

find 
shelter 
in 
nature, 
work 

with nature, and live as nature. 

Though structure and routine 

are necessary for human life, I 

still wish people depended more 

on nature and less on structure. I 

wish manmade systems were more 

prepared for the wild capacities of 

nature. I wish that people could 

live 
independently; 
live 
more 

like birds. Birds are aware of the 

structures around them, yet they 

do not depend on nor are they 

controlled by them. Some have 

even taken the liberty of building 

nests on stores, houses, and power 

lines.

Humans 
have 
developed 

far more than birds and have 

surpassed other species in every 

way possible, yet in the wake 

of something as natural as a 

virus, we are subject to complete 

destruction. All our developments 

and structures were shaken by 

nature and if the coronavirus has 

proven anything to me, it is that 

in the face of nature, man does not 

stand a chance. With the future 

dependent on the course of the 

virus, the Earth will remain in 

control and there is no manmade 

structure, object, or system that 

can withstand its strength.

This 
pandemic, 
though 

unfortunate and chaotic, has shown 

its value. People are learning to 

live while connected with nature. 

Enabled to be productive, people 

are prioritizing their physical and 

mental wellness. Worried for the 

health of the elderly, people are 

caring for and connecting more 

with their parents and neighbors. 

Encouragement of self-isolation 

has led people to travel within 

their 
own 
minds, 
meditating 

and contemplating their lives. 

These times are uncomfortable 

and stressful, yet humans have 

managed to thrive. We will come 

out of this situation, stronger and 

wiser, leading a life more like the 

birds.

Heads Up

MichiganDaily.com

For years, Cosmopolitan has been 

the biggest female-focused millennial 

brand in the world, influencing and 

shaping the lifestyles of women. 

Cosmopolitan’s captivation of society 

essentially created this idea of a 

“Cosmo Girl,” a bold, independent, 

fashion forward woman — an idea 

which consequently inflicts harm 

on society, because we can’t all be a 

cosmo girl.

Meet Amani Badran, a trailblazer 

for 
Arab 
and 
Muslim 
women, 

Dearborn native, Ross MBA, an 

engineer at DTE and someone who 

lives in a cosmo world but is not 

exactly a cosmo girl. Badran is bold, 

independent and fashion forward, 

just like a cosmo girl. Her boldness, 

independence and style choices are 

not a result of the Western standards 

that Cosmopolitan champions, but 

rather what she likes to call “a happy 

medium” between her Muslim and 

American 
heritages, 
which 
she 

describes as “not exclusive.” 

This happy medium is nonexistent 

in Western brands, and causes many 

Muslim girls to feel displaced, less 

beautiful and discouraged; Badran 

was one of those girls growing up, and 

now wants to create a brand and space 

where Muslim girls are able to feel 

beautiful, inspired and empowered. 

Badran is currently in the works of 

creating an online magazine where 

Muslim women are able to share their 

stories and interests on topics ranging 

from 
fashion, 
family, 
fun/travel, 

finance/career and food/fitness. 

“Every Muslim girl is unique in her 

own way—each of us coming together 

in this platform like a perfectly, 

imperfect mosaic,” Badran said.

Badran’s 
personal 
experiences 

led her to want to create this space. 

Growing up, Badran loved reading 

lifestyle 
magazines, 
and 
had 
a 

goal of becoming editor in chief of 

Cosmopolitan, despite its complete 

disregard 
for 
her 
identity. 
She 

internalized what Western media 

propels is beauty and decided her 

hijab strays too much from the set 

precedent. However now, Badran is 

unapologetically 
comfortable 
and 

proud of her identity, and realizes the 

unnecessary struggle she endured 

getting there. 

“I wish I had embraced my hijab 

for what it was—unique and different, 

and a symbol of strength, rather than 

trying to morph it into something that 

others would understand,” Badran 

said. “I wish I had a platform, a space, 

where I saw the beauty of being a 

Muslim girl, where I saw how to style 

my dress in a way that aligned with 

my values, where I saw more Muslim 

women succeeding in education and 

career.”

For Muslim girls like myself, this 

brand representation is much needed 

and long over due. It is time for us to 

make seeing people that look like 

ourselves and lead similar lives a 

normal occurrence, instead of an 

anomaly. More importantly, it is time 

for us to have a platform to showcase 

our art, our writing, our voices and our 

accomplishments in an authentic way 

with no adaptations made or questions 

asked. It is time that we make sure 

the next generation of Muslim girls 

do not have to grow up looking at 

Western norms and thinking this is 

what could be, and instead, embrace 

their identity. Soon it will become 

necessary that we as a society reinvent 

our understanding of what it means to 

be and to look American. We will no 

longer have room for exclusivity.

Muslim Disney Princesses

Dearborn Youth Theater’s Production of Frozen Jr. and the Importance of Representation

HIBA DAGHER

MiC Columnist

In Reel Bad Arabs, Jack Shaheen 

explored the portrayals of Arab and 

Muslim characters in film. After 

analyzing a thousand different films 

from 1896 to 2000, he found that 12 

films had positive depictions of Arabs 

and Muslims, 52 neutral, and 936 

negative. And representations of Arabs 

and Muslims haven’t gotten better in 

the past twenty years. There may be 

crumbs of decent representation since, 

but Shaheen’s work is still relevant. 

Nestled in Dearborn, Michigan, a 

town with the largest concentrations 

of Arabs and Arab Americans outside 

of the Middle East, the Dearborn Youth 

Theater program, is trying to change 

all of that. Director Rashid Beydoun, 

musical director Vanessa El-Zein and 

assistant director Lisa Cronin work to 

encourage and include students of all 

backgrounds in their productions.

In January, I attended the Dearborn 

Youth Theater’s production of Frozen 

Jr. Sitting there, in the thousand-

and-some-change seat auditorium, I 

was fixated as a cast of more than 60 

students performed the classic Disney 

story. Coming in, I didn’t expect to fall 

in love with the show as much as I did 

— like many older siblings and cousins, 

I fell victim to constant reruns of “Let 

It Go” for a good four years after the 

movie was released in 2012. My love for 

the show didn’t come from the music 

or the dancing but from the cast. For 

the first time in forever (get it!) Anna 

and Elsa were played by two incredible 

Muslim, Arab American actresses.

It was then that the story took on 

a completely different meaning for 

me. I loved seeing such strong female 

characters played by Arab, Muslim 

women. It created a reality and 

possibilities that I had only dreamt of. 

Dearborn High School junior Nadia 

Gellani, who played Elsa, and Fordson 

High School senior Jenna Kobeissi, 

played their respective characters 

as funny, angry, ditzy, free-spirited, 

temperamental, reserved, silly, hurt, 

excitable, optimistic, awkward, calm, 

regal and most importantly — normal. 

It’s rare for Arab, Muslim American 

women, and especially Arab, Muslim 

American women who wear the hijab, 

to be portrayed like this.

Even now I find it kind of silly 

with how much I resonated with this 

show. Like, it’s Frozen, of all things. 

But as someone who has loved the 

theatre — pretty much for as long as 

I can remember — it was jarring to 

actually see two Muslim teenage girls 

perform on such an enormous stage. 

Throughout High School, I watched 

as the other (and conveniently non-

majority PoC) high schools in the 

district performed Into the Woods and 

Little Shop of Horrors and be afforded 

with opportunities to attend state-wide 

theater conferences, while my group of 

friends performed Shakespeare in the 

French classroom because it was the 

cheapest, and therefore only, thing we 

could do (which, by the way, no hate 

at all to Shakespeare, I was the one 

pushing us to do all his plays in the first 

place). I was never able to “see” myself 

on stage — which is probably why 

seeing this show meant so much to me. 

“The best part,” Gellani told me 

after the show, “is when the kids come 

up to you and they’re like ‘Hi Anna’, ‘Hi 

Elsa’ that’s really special.” Speaking to 

the Gellani and Kobeissi, they really 

asserted how comfortable they felt 

working on this production, and it 

was unlike any other productions 

that they’d ever worked on — even in 

Dearborn. Kobeissi said working with 

Rashid was “the first time that I’ve 

ever felt included, where things like 

where my parents came from or my 

religion didn’t matter.” 

Anna and Elsa weren’t the only 

stars of the show. Hans was played in 

the Glacial cast by Edsel Ford senior 

Jameel Baksh and in the Arctic Cast 

by Edsel Ford sophomore Amen 

Salha. And both actors have been 

with Rashid since his very first shows 

at Stout Middle School: Jameel with 

Schoolhouse Rock, and Amen with 

Hairspray. When asking both of them 

about what it was like working on a 

show with Baydoun, Amen had this to 

say: “You feel pushed. Rashid pushes 

us to our limit, and he knows that we 

can give even more than we think can.”

Jameel similarly had this to say: “We 

learn so much about acting, I think it 

shows — I’ve never taken a dancing 

class, I’ve never taken a singing class, 

I’ve never taken an acting class, all of 

my experience comes from Baydoun 

and after 4-5 years of doing it I can tap 

into these wells of experience.” 

It’s not only representation that’s 

important, though.It’s the space where 

representation is created. And director 

Rashid Baydoun has dedicated his 

life to creating brave, generative and 

most importantly, inclusive spaces that 

allow for folks from all backgrounds to 

participate. A show is composed of so 

many people working behind scenes, 

and it’s their support — the costume 

designers that designed the modest 

yet faithful transformation dress for 

Elsa’s “Let It Go” number, the “drama 

mamas” that helped along the way, 

the backstage crew, composed of Arab 

and Muslim students — that make the 

show. 

“Casting should be inclusive of all 

people,” Baydon said. “Period. Don’t 

tell me you can’t do something. ‘I can’t’ 

is not in my vocabulary.” 

It’s easy to be consumed by all the 

negativity that surrounds our lives. 

It’s even easier for the nicer things 

about the world around us — the 

people striving to make real change, 

the innovators and artists constantly 

at work, the communities that band 

together — to fall through the cracks, 

but that doesn’t mean they don’t 

exist. The Dearborn Youth Theater 

company, as small or inconsequential 

it may be in the grand scheme of the 

universe, is a perfect example.


T

he 
newspaper 

endorsement, 
like 

the appendix, is a 

relic of a simpler 

time 
that 
is 
not 

particularly useful 

today. 
However, 

like the appendix, 

the 
endorsement 

persists. 
Before 

looking 
at 
the 

history 
of 
the 

endorsement, 
it’s 

worth 
considering 

its efficacy in recent 

years. In 2016, The 

Michigan 
Daily 
endorsed 

former Secretary of State 

Hillary Clinton and then Ohio 

Gov. John Kasich in their 

respective 
primaries. 
The 

Daily then endorsed Clinton 

in 
the 
general 
election. 

Impressively 
enough, 
all 

three 
of 
these 
endorsees 

lost their race — Clinton lost 

Michigan in both the primary 

and the general and Kasich 

barely managed to come in 

third place in his primary. 

In 2020, The Daily endorsed 

Sen. Bernie Sander, I-Vt., in 

the primary and from looking 

at the results, it appears the 

Midas touch continues apace. 

For the sake of Vice President 

Joe 
Biden’s 
campaign, 
I 

would suggest he avoid the 

endorsement if he hopes for 

success in this year’s general 

election.

The ostensible point of 

an endorsement is to swing 

voters by successfully making 

a 
case 
for 
a 
candidate. 

However, 
voters 
are 
not 

always willing to listen to 

these outlets, especially when 

trust in the media is low. 

As a result of this, it might 

make sense to stop endorsing 

candidates until public trust 

is reestablished. 

The 
history 
of 
the 

newspaper 
endorsement, 

unlike an actual endorsement, 

is fascinating. While there 

may be other papers that 

did it sooner, The New York 

Times has been endorsing 

candidates for President since 

1860. The Times is one of the 

bigger newspapers that still 

endorses 
candidates 
today 

— the Wall Street Journal 

formally stopped the practice 

after 1928. USA Today has 

done it only once in its 30-odd 

year history (and 

even 
that 
was 

more of an anti-

endorsement 

than 
an 

affirmative one).

Though 
the 

process 
for 

the 
Times’ 

endorsement 

has 
changed 

throughout 

the 
years, 
its 

most significant alterations 

came this year. For one, the 

discussions were no longer 

off the record — instead, 

they were on HBO. And when 

the Times actually decided 

on endorsing, rather than 

picking one candidate, they 

sensibly picked two because, 

as we all know, everyone 

gets two ballots. Of course, 

the endorsement was about 

as helpful as a white crayon 

and both of their endorsees 

saw respectable third- and 

sixth-place finishes in the 

primaries prior to dropping 

out of the race.

So 
why 
do 
these 

endorsements persist? It is 

because 
newspapers 
and 

similar types of institutions 

have been unable to reckon 

with their recent loss of 

power. However, continuing 

to 
endorse 
candidates 
is 

unlikely to address this and 

will instead exacerbate the 

problem. The lack of trust 

discussed earlier is partially 

because people believe the 

media has its thumb on 

the scale for some candidate 

or cause. Though people can 

scream until they’re blue in 

the face that there’s a line 

between editorial and hard 

news, there appears to be 

bias on both of those angles 

to many readers. Thus, an 

endorsement is both unlikely 

to 
sway 
voters 
and 
also 

likely to continue to burn 

trust, neither of which are 

admirable goals. 

However, 
some 
might 

say that the point of an 

endorsement is more than 

getting a candidate elected. 

John McCormick, editorial 

page editor for the Chicago 

Tribune, 
has 
said 
that 

the electoral side is one 

part of the reason for the 

endorsement but it is not the 

whole point. In his view, the 

point of an endorsement is to 

“explain to the world what 

that publication is, what it 

advocates, how it thinks, 

what 
principles 
it 
holds 

dear.”

However, McCormick and 

those who think like him 

might reflect on the 2016 

election a little bit more 

carefully before continuing 

on with these proclamations. 

If 
it 
is 
true 
that 
the 

endorsement 
represents 

what 
publications 
think, 

what they advocate and what 

they hold dear, the fact that 

the American public decided 

to vote against all of that 

might be a cause for concern. 

Beyond this, 2016 should 

have been the death knell for 

the idea that endorsements 

matter. Trump stacked up a 

total of only 19 newspaper 

endorsements and was still 

elected president.

If endorsements are about 

values 
and 
not 
politics, 

that’s fine. It’s not good, 

however, for our democracy, 

as we need a press that the 

populace believes in. Since 

endorsements 
can’t 
get 

votes, it is worth considering 

whether or not they should 

amble on — the appendix in 

black in white.

O

ur environment is under 

attack 
by 
the 
Trump 

administration. 
Through 

the repeal of critical environmental 

regulations and the systematic actions 

that have been taken to weaken the 

Environmental Protection Agency, 

the federal government is failing the 

American people and the planet. It is 

more important now than ever that 

people raise their voices and push for 

environmental protection at every 

level of government. 

Since winning the presidency, 

President Donald Trump and his 

administration have boasted about 

slashing environmental regulations 

that they viewed as restricting the 

abilities of businesses to grow. 

However, many of the regulations 

that 
have 
been 
repealed 
were 

vitally 
important. 
The 
Trump 

administration ended a requirement 

for oil and gas companies to report 

methane emissions, even though 

methane is a greenhouse gas that 

contributes 
greatly 
to 
climate 

change. It has also scaled back a rule 

designed to limit toxic emissions 

from major industrial polluters and 

reversed a rule that prevented coal 

companies from dumping mining 

debris into local streams.

There have also been many changes 

to regulations specifically designed to 

help prevent catastrophic situations. 

The Trump administration repealed 

an Obama-Era rule that required 

braking system upgrades for trains 

hauling flammable liquids. It also 

scraped 
regulations 
on 
offshore 

drilling put in place after the 2010 BP 

oil spill. This catastrophic oil spill 

killed 11 people and spewed over four 

million barrels of oil into the Gulf of 

Mexico.

The Trump administration has 

even 
cut 
regulations 
that 
were 

widely accepted and agreed upon. 

Recently, it was announced that the 

administration would change the 

way health benefits from regulations 

are calculated. This step will help 

pave the way for power plants to 

release large amounts of mercury 

and other toxins. Even major energy 

companies have disagreed with this 

change, saying they do not want the 

Trump administration to change this 

rule, arguing that it is not necessary 

and will be detrimental to the 

environment. Despite this opposition 

for the groups this rule is supposed to 

help, the Trump administration has 

pushed ahead with this dangerous 

policy change.

In addition to cutting regulations, 

the 
Trump 
administration 
has 

worked to significantly curtail the 

power and resources of the EPA. 

Trump’s two EPA directors have 

had deep ties to energy lobbyists. 

Additionally, Trump has continued 

to chip away at the EPA’s budget, 

proposing a 31 percent cut in 2019.

Each of these actions taken by the 

president and his administration 

endangers the safety of all Americans 

and the safety of our planet. It is 

ludicrous that they are putting the 

interests of big business ahead of the 

interests of everyday Americans. We 

want clean water, we want to be safe 

from oil spills, we want to curtail 

climate change. Yet the president is 

ignoring all of that so he can claim 

a 
pro-business, 
anti-regulation 

approach. 

Given the federal government’s 

total disregard for environmental 

protection, it is more important than 

ever that we look to other levels 

of government to help protect our 

environment.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 

recently put out a proposed 2021 

budget, which calls for critical 

funding for environmental programs 

and protection. The proposal asks 

for $40 million for climate-resilient 

infrastructure grants, $4 million 

for legal efforts under the Attorney 

General to protect residents from 

chemical contamination of drinking 

water and commercial pollution and 

$20 million for rapid environmental 

contamination response.

This funding is critical to help 

ensure 
the 
protection 
of 
our 

environment and the safety of all 

Michiganders. The money for the 

rapid environmental contamination 

response is imperative for dangerous 

situations, like when earlier this year 

a green liquid containing cancer-

causing chemicals began leaking 

onto I-696 in Madison Heights, 

MI. Climate resilience funding can 

help prepare cities for the impact 

of climate change, such as flooding, 

which is likely to get more severe. 

The money to the Attorney General’s 

office helps to demonstrate the 

state’s commitment to fighting for 

clean 
drinking 
water, 
especially 

following the discovery of lead that 

led to the Flint water crisis.

We all have the power to help 

promote 
important 
policies 
and 

funding, especially on the local and 

state level. If you are appalled by the 

actions of the Trump administration 

and are terrified of the looming 

threat 
of 
climate 
change 
and 

environmental 
degradation, 
then 

make your voice heard. Call your 

local and state legislators, advocate 

for policies that you believe in 

and vote in all elections. Through 

these actions, we can help hold our 

leaders accountable and help put 

our nation on a path toward greater 

environmental stewardship.

J

ust over a month ago, 

I 
contributed 
to 
a 

Michigan Daily Editorial 

Board article on the COVID-19 

outbreak, a piece which primarily 

warned the community not to 

panic. In light of recent events, 

it’s almost surreal to think about 

sitting in that room now, jokingly 

passing around hand sanitizer 

and casually discussing what I 

then believed to be a novel issue 

that would not have any major 

impact on life at the University 

of Michigan. And coverage did 

die down, for a time. But now, 

COVID-19 seems to be the only 

thing anyone is talking about — 

and for good reason. 

On 
Wednesday, 
March 
11, 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel announced on Twitter 

that all classes on the University’s 

three campuses would be canceled 

for March 12 and 13 and would 

move to an online format from 

March 16 through the end of the 

semester. Events of more than 

100 people were canceled, along 

with all spring and summer 

study 
abroad 
programs. 
This 

announcement followed similar 

decisions by schools across the 

country, including the University of 

Washington, Harvard University 

and Michigan State University. 

Also on Wednesday, the World 

Health 
Organization 
declared 

the coronavirus outbreak to be a 

global pandemic as it continues 

to spread rapidly. Sporting and 

cultural events — including the 

2020 NCAA men’s and women’s 

basketball tournaments — are 

continually being postponed or 

canceled, and on March 12 Gov. 

Gretchen Whitmer announced all 

Michigan K-12 schools will close 

through at least April 5. All of this 

demonstrates how COVID-19, a 

story I and many others thought 

would be lost to the 24-hour news 

cycle, has rapidly developed to 

impact life on campus, in Ann Arbor 

and across the world in a massive 

and seemingly unprecedented way.

Despite 
everything 
that’s 

happened in the past few days, 

however, I stand by the original 

message the Editorial Board 

published in February — don’t 

panic. This is easier said than 

done when it feels like the world 

is crumbling around you. It 

certainly seems that way for me. 

As a junior transfer, my limited 

time at the University has been 

cut even shorter and the social 

network I was growing has 

been blunted. My spring study 

abroad is canceled and I won’t 

be spending this March making 

brackets or watching games. 

Of course, COVID-19 is much 

greater 
than 
any 
individual 

biography. With this outbreak 

playing out on such an expansive 

— indeed, global — scale, broad 

actions must be taken. Likewise, 

something widespread is being 

revealed. This viral event is 

highlighting the fundamental 

errors in the way we live and the 

way our societies are structured. 

If we pay close attention to what 

is being uncovered and respond 

with meaningful action, the 

COVID-19 outbreak can be a 

learning opportunity.

The development of COVID-

19 has coincided with the 2020 

presidential primaries, and one 

of the key talking points in the 

goal to unseat President Donald 

Trump is health care reform. 

Editorial 
Board 
endorsed 

candidate Sen. Bernard Sanders, 

I-Vt., argues this outbreak has 

shown America the necessity of 

adopting Medicare for All. When 

a health crisis has the potential 

to impact everyone, it becomes 

clear 
that 
everyone 
should 

have 
access 
to 
high-quality 

care. While some insurers have 

pledged to cover the cost of the 

coronavirus test, the expense of 

further testing and treatment 

that will accompany a positive 

result may prevent individuals 

from seeking the care they need. 

Moreover, not everyone has 

access to health insurance — in 

2018, 27.5 million Americans 

were 
uninsured. 
And 
many 

of those with insurance have 

prohibitively expensive barriers 

to accessing coverage, such as 

high deductibles, copays and 

out-of-network costs, all factors 

which are especially salient 

given the current economic crisis 

that has accompanied COVID-19. 

Even long before the outbreak 

began, the American health 

care structure has been shaping 

how this or any other public 

health 
concern 
would 
play 

out. Millions of Americans are 

denied the preventive care and 

knowledge that could support 

improved outcomes in a crisis, 

such 
as 
regular 
check-ups 

and diagnoses of chronic or 

underlying conditions. Health 

care is a human right and no one 

should be denied the opportunity 

to achieve their best health — or 

survive a pandemic — based 

on their socioeconomic status. 

COVID-19 has fully exposed 

the flaws of a largely private 

insurance 
market 
and 
an 

overpriced medical system. It has 

given us evidence of an urgent 

need to entirely restructure how 

we design and distribute health 

care. 

Beyond treating coronavirus, 

the 
wide-scale 
preventative 

measures 
enacted 
to 
slow 

the disease’s spread provide 

a chance at a re-evaluation 

of how we work in America. 

Several of the world’s largest 

companies, including Michigan-

headquartered Ford and General 

Motors, tech giants Amazon 

and Google and financial firms 

JPMorgan, Chase and Goldman 

Sachs, have instituted work-

from-home policies for at least 

some 
employees. 
Like 
the 

University, a substantial number 

of academic institutions are 

transitioning 
to 
remote 

learning. It seems COVID-19 

has finally motivated the world’s 

largest and most influential 

institutions to consider policies 

that disability advocates have 

been pushing: more expansive, 

accessible 
work-from-home 

policies. These remote policies 

can 
spur 
innovation 
which 

will shape a more accessible 

working 
landscape 
for 
all 

people of varying abilities. We 

can discover that it is entirely 

possible to be productive from 

home — for some, it may be far 

more productive than sitting 

in an office. We can build a 

more flexible schedule in which 

productivity 
is 
not 
limited 

from nine-to-five. We can even 

reconstruct 
the 
concept 
of 

productivity, acknowledging the 

importance of work across the 

gamut of pay grades and pushing 

for living wages. 

Of course, not all work can 

realistically be done remotely 

— retail and customer service 

are notable examples. For these 

roles, we must mandate paid 

sick leave, as illness should not 

prevent one from making rent or 

putting dinner on the table. In 

customer-facing roles, especially 

those involving food, people 

should not be working when 

sick — for their own health and 

for the health of others. Across 

the board, we must normalize 

the often-chastised concept of 

taking a sick day. Our current 

working environment pushes 

for self-sacrifice for the goal 

of productivity, but a rapidly 

spreading and potentially deadly 

virus is a grave reminder of our 

limited time and the importance 

of prioritizing the well-being 

of ourselves and of others over 

material gains. This outbreak is 

a call to reconsider how we view 

work in our global society and to 

rediscover a healthier work-life 

balance.

COVID-19 is having radical 

impacts on both local and 

global communities, and the 

ramifications will be felt for 

years to come, fundamentally 

changing the way we live. And 

where there is change, there 

is opportunity. It’s absolutely 

justified to feel like the world 

is falling apart and to have the 

associated panic for a period of 

time — my now-private Twitter 

feed is a primary example. 

But if we adopt a mindset of 

acknowledging the flaws of 

modernity which COVID-19 has 

brought center-stage and strive 

to take action in response, we 

may emerge from the chaos on 

the path to a society that is more 

fair and equitable than the one 

we had before. In this period 

of temporary social distance, 

it’s especially critical to keep in 

mind that it’s not me, it’s us. Let’s 

capitalize on this opportunity 

to think and act radically for a 

better future. This contemplative 

approach 
is 
imperative 
to 

emerging 
successfully 
from 

COVID-19 — along with washing 

our hands for at least 20 seconds.

S

ince 
the 
2020 
presidential 

primary season kicked off almost 

two months ago with the Iowa 

caucuses, millions of Americans have 

carefully watched as the Democratic 

candidates fight for the chance to face 

off against President Donald Trump in 

November.

With 
an 
original 
field 
of 
23 

candidates, the race on the Democratic 

side has proven to be turbulent and 

unpredictable. 
While 
Sen. 
Bernie 

Sanders, 
I-Vt., 
a 
self-proclaimed 

“Democratic 
socialist,” 
enjoyed 
a 

considerable lead early on, former 

Vice President Joe Biden has managed 

to emerge as the frontrunner after 

impressive performances across the 

country. And though Sanders remains 

in the race for now, Biden — who has 

marketed himself as a moderate well-

positioned to defeat Trump in the 

general election — now has a clear, 

undeniable path to the nomination.

But amid all of the action playing out 

between the Democratic candidates, 

few have taken note of the trend on the 

Republican side that points to major 

problems for the Democratic standard-

bearer in November. While Biden, 

Sanders and the rest of the field have 

constantly tried to trample each other 

and make their pitches to the American 

people, the most impressive candidate of 

all remains the current president.

Many 
Americans 
consider 
the 

Republican primaries to be dull and 

uninteresting. After all, for all practical 

purposes, the current president is 

running unopposed for the Republican 

nomination. However, the truth is 

that regardless of what happens on 

the 
Democratic 
side, 
Trump 
has 

consistently stunned political pundits 

who see his performance as a “red flag 

for Democrats.”

From the beginning of the wearisome 

primary 
process, 
the 
current 

president has racked up a tremendous, 

unprecedented amount of support from 

Republican voters in both red and blue 

states who are energized to reelect the 

president for a second term. Democrats 

have great reason to be concerned about 

how this enthusiasm will translate to 

the general election later this year.

The mainstream media wouldn’t 

bother to report on this, but Trump’s 

support at the polls this election season 

is unprecedented on multiple levels. We 

all know that former Presidents George 

W. Bush and Barack Obama were 

relatively popular incumbents who went 

on to secure second terms. In particular, 

we have more recent memories of the 

level of support that Obama received 

from all corners of the country. What 

most of us don’t know, though, is that 

voters are turning out in higher numbers 

for Trump than Obama, Bush and other 

successful incumbents in their own 

primary races.

In the New Hampshire Republican 

primary this year, Trump received 

about 130,000 votes, more than double 

the number that both Obama and Bush 

captured in their respective reelection 

bids. In Vermont, a traditionally left-

leaning state, Trump beat every past 

Republican and Democratic incumbent 

in the last 40 years. Additionally, 

in 
Tennessee, 
early 
indications 

revealed that voter turnout from the 

competitive 2016 Republican primary 

dipped only 3 percent, a clear display 

of the level of support the president 

has been able to maintain throughout 

his first term.

At the same time, while the 

president 
continues 
to 
perform 

exceptionally well compared to past 

incumbents, his total number of votes 

in inconsequential races threaten 

the levels of support that the current 

Democratic candidates have secured 

amid a divisive primary process. 

In the Texas primary, nearly 1.9 

million voters cast their ballots for 

Trump, while Biden, who won that 

state’s Democratic competition, only 

captured about 700,000 votes. Texas 

may be a state that is typically friendly 

to Republican candidates, but nobody 

can deny the fact that the president, 

during a pointless primary, captured 

almost triple as many votes as the 

Democratic frontrunner did. What 

makes this even more significant 

is the fact that Texas is considered 

by many to be turning increasingly 

purple.

Trump has extended this impressive 

performance to other states as well. In 

Alabama, Trump won almost 700,000 

votes, while Biden only managed to 

collect roughly 290,000. In fact, only 

about 450,000 turned out to cast a 

vote for any Democratic candidate 

at all in the state. The numbers tell a 

similar story in Arkansas.

In the end, it has never been so clear 

that Americans across the country 

want four more years of Trump. The 

remarkable energy and enthusiasm 

the president — who ran on a platform 

to “Make America Great Again” — has 

gathered is truly unrivaled in modern 

political history and should deeply 

worry the Democratic Party. 

Ultimately, we shouldn’t be paying 

attention to the daily movements of 

the Democratic race, because at this 

point, it couldn’t matter less whether 

Biden or Sanders emerges as the 

standard-bearer. The real story is the 

unprecedented political movement that 

Trump began when he first announced 

his candidacy, the movement that 

propelled him into the presidency in 

2016 and the movement that will win 

him a second term this November.

I first happened upon Conan Gray’s 

music as I would any great discovery: on 

a YouTube binge. An e-boy poster child 

with a mess of hair and a killer pout, 

I immediately wanted to dislike him. 

Instead, I clicked on music video after 

music video, impressed that he could 

be so melodramatic yet extremely self-

aware. Gray’s debut album Kid Krow feels 

like staring at a glowing laptop screen — 

dizzying and addictive.

It’s no surprise, then, that Gray got his 

start as a YouTuber. A video titled “Let Me 

Introduce Myself” shows a young, 2013 

Conan innocently waving at the camera; 

by 2016 he hit 

millions 
of 

views, and has 

since 
followed 

a 
similar 

trajectory 
to 

fellow YouTuber-

turned-popstar 

Troye 
Sivan. 

Unlike 
Sivan, 

however, 
Gray 

has stayed rooted 

in 
the 
culture 

he’s 
helped 

cultivate. 
His 

recent 
videos 

highlight 
him 

making 
art, 

getting his ear 

pierced 
and 

shopping, 
all 

activities 
that 

further his brand as not only a vulnerable 

singer-songwriter, 
but 
as 
someone 

accessible enough to be thought of as a 

friend. 

The hours he has spent building an 

audience shows up most explicitly on 

Kid Krow’s interludes “(Online Love)” 

and “(Can We Be Friends?).” Vignettes 

of internet love, these soft, breezy tracks 

treasure the careful kindling of long-

distance relationships. On the latter, Gray 

sweetly threatens to “knock (the) teeth 

out” of anyone who messes with his fans. 

It’s charming.

The rest of Kid Krow lives in the gray — 

the almost love, the chase of an unreachable 

crush, the understanding that you’re being 

led on, the terrifying acceptance that you 

like it. On “The Cut that Always Bleeds” 

Conan pleads for a on-again off-again lover 

to leave, then ends up begging them to 

stay. “Comfort Crowd” acknowledges the 

lonely, melancholic ache that comes with 

adolescence. Every track feels a bit delicate 

and unsure.

By way of capturing that uncertainty 

of adolescence, Kid Krow feels like the 

second you’ve shut your bedroom door: The 

record is a soundtrack to the movie reel of 

memories your mind plays when you’re 

alone. It’s intimate enough to know all of 

your insecurities on “Heather.” It’s petty 

enough to understand your outlandish 

dreams of revenge on “Checkmate.” Gray’s 

lyricism feels close in a way that only a kid 

raised by the Internet can be. It’s obvious 

that he’s scrolled through years worth of 

oversharing — Kid Krow is his opportunity 

to contribute. 

According to an interview with People, 

Gray’s 
best 

friend 
told 

him 
he 
was 

like 
a 
crow: 

mysterious, 

watching, 

knowing. 

“Kid 
Krow,” 

therefore, 

became 
Gray’s 

superhero 
alter 

ego. 
On 
“The 

Story,” 
for 

example, Conan 

narrates the sad 

endings of kids 

whose “parents 

were evil” from 

a bird’s eye view. 

Gray 
worries 

that “that’s just 

the 
way 
the 

world works / it ain’t funny, it ain’t pretty, 

it ain’t sweet,” but he stays hopeful. He 

doesn’t trivialize brooding, he embraces it.

But Gray’s music isn’t constrained to 

moody 3AM listen. On “Maniac,” he has 

fun calling out an ex who’s told everyone 

that he’s the crazy one. “Wish You Were 

Sober” is intoxicatingly bouncy. The flip 

side to the hours I picture Conan laying 

in bed overthinking, is lots of dancing. 

Thankfully, being emotional doesn’t always 

have to be so sad and lonely. Besides, Gray 

recognizes that all of this drama is kind of 

funny. 

A week before the album’s release, 

Conan tweeted that he “wrote this whole 

entire album about someone (he) never 

dated and never kissed.” Speaking for a 

generation that Internet-stalks, Snapchats, 

and texts as much as we talk in person — if 

Conan’s tweet isn’t upsettingly relatable, I 

don’t know what is.

about love in the digital age

If you ever say something and then find 

yourself thinking, “Was that racist?”, odds 

are, it probably was. That self-awareness of 

prejudice and microaggressions may seem 

reflexive to some in 2020, but in 1997, that 

may not have been the case for everyone. 

And it certainly isn’t for the characters of 

“Little Fires Everywhere.”

Set in the Shaker Heights suburb of 

Cleveland, 
“Little 
Fires 
Everywhere” 

follows two families separated by class and 

race. In the summer of 1997, the wealthy, 

white Richardson family begins renting 

one of their properties to struggling 

artist Mia Warren (Kerry Washington, 

“Scandal”) and her daughter Pearl (Lexi 

Underwood, “If Not Now, When?”). Elena 

Richardson (Reese Witherspoon, “Big 

Little Lies”) immediately seeks to befriend 

Mia, whom she rented to in a moment of 

white guilt after accidentally reporting 

her to the police 

for trespassing. 

Despite 

Elena’s fumbling 

attempts 
at 

gaining 
her 

friendship, 

Mia 
resists 

making 
ties 

with anyone in 

the exceedingly 

planned 

community, 
as 

she 
has 
spent 

her entire life 

moving 
from 

city to city every 

few 
months. 

While 
tensions 

heighten 

between 
Mia 

and Elena, their 

children, 
now 

attending 
the 

same 
school, 

become close friends and bring their 

families together. Soon, Mia agrees to take 

a job as the Richardsons’ housekeeper in 

order to protect Pearl and study the hidden 

rifts in the seemingly perfect family’s 

relationships.

The first few episodes released of “Little 

Fires Everywhere” have been a lengthy 

flashback meant to set up the eventual 

arson of the Richardson’s mansion months 

after Mia and Pearl’s arrival in Shaker 

Heights. With this knowledge in mind, 

the audience is left wondering who would 

set a house on fire with a family of five 

still inside and what would drive them 

to such violence in what appears to be a 

picturesque community?

“Little Fires Everywhere,” while full 

of artful suspense and beautiful writing, 

also places viewers in a constant state 

of discomfort with dialogue rife with 

awkward attempts at political correctness. 

Elena, insecure in her internalized racism, 

frequently brands herself as accepting 

despite her intense distrust of Mia and 

inherent biases as a highly privileged 

white woman.

Based on the best-selling novel of the 

same name, this miniseries examines not 

only the racial tensions of the late 1990s 

but also the very American tragedy of 

suburban living. Mia, who prides herself 

on going with the flow and remaining 

unattached, finds herself in the middle 

of a neighborhood so orchestrated and 

organized that it feels as if the oh-so 

permanent walls are closing in. Despite her 

resistance to embrace the Shaker Heights 

philosophy 
of 

complete control 

over chaos, her 

love 
for 
her 

daughter tethers 

her to what she 

sees as a prison 

of tranquility.

Because of this 

commitment, 

Mia and Pearl 

are stuck inside 

a 
system 
of 

weakening 

social strata as 

the threat of the 

eventual 
fire 

looms over the 

audience. 
With 

each 
strained 

interaction 

between 

them 
and 
the 

Richardsons, 

“Little 
Fires 

Everywhere” shows how the build-up of 

intense pressure can lead to a destructive 

explosion.

This show, while only beginning, has 

already constructed an intricate web of 

personal relationships and largely owes 

its success to the incredible performances 

of Washington and Witherspoon. As 

the series continues to unfold and the 

characters further unravel, Elena and 

Mia’s 
complex 
dynamic 
will 
remain 

the center of a thrilling story and pose 

questions to viewers about how even 

sparks can start wildfires.
