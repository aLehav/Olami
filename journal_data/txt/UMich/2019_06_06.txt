Researchers hope 
work sheds light 
on experiences of 
LGBT workers

LGBT 
federal 
workers 
reported worse experiences at 
their offices compared to their 
non-LGBT colleagues, reports 
a study conducted by assistant 
professor of sociology Erin Cech 
and Rackham student William 
Rothwell. This disparity tends 
to lead to higher turnover 
intentions, Cech and Rothwell 
claim.
In an email to The Daily, 
Rothwell said he and Cech 
started 
the 
study 
in 
2014 
because they were inspired by 
data from the Federal Employee 
Viewpoint 
Survey. 
Rothwell 
hoped 
their 
work 
would 
bring light to the unobserved 
discrimination 
of 
LGBT 
individuals.
“We knew that there were 
likely important and interesting 
stories that we could tell with 
this data,” Rothwell wrote. “I 
think that these findings, in 
general, are especially daunting 

given that federal agencies and 
workers are actually protected 
under 
non-discrimination 
legislation meaning that these 
results may provide a somewhat 
conservative estimate of the 
extent 
of 
LGBT 
workplace 
inequality more broadly.”
According to the Federal 
Trade Commission, the Equal 
Employment 
Opportunity 
Commission enforces laws that 
make it unlawful for federal 
agencies to discriminate against 
employees and job applicants.
Rothwell said it is rare to 
come across data on LGBT 
populations, 
but 
they 
were 
able to work with the FEVS 
data of 300,000 respondents 
because about 11,000 of those 
respondents identified as LGBT. 
Cech also noted their study uses 
the “LGBT” acronym because 
the FEVS survey contained 
questions that captured LGBT 
status. She added the “LGBTQ+” 
acronym is more fully inclusive 
of gender nonbinary and queer 
persons and was disappointed 
these 
identities 
were 
not 
accounted for.
The researchers also found 
LGBT workers reported feeling 
their work was less respected by 
their supervisors and non
LGBT 
peers. 
Cech 
and 
Rothwell 
concluded 
these 
processes 
are 
intersectional 

with LGBT women and people 
of 
color, 
as 
they 
reported 
significantly 
more 
negative 
experiences than LGBT men 
and white workers.
Although 
equality 
for 
LGBT-identifying persons has 
increased over the last three 
decades, Cech said she has 
seen greater instances of hate 
speech toward LGBT persons 
within the last five years. She 
added this study took place in 
a federal workforce with non-
discrimination policies in place, 
so their conclusions may have 
been equal or worse in other 
employment sectors.
“Little research, up until 
this point, has been able to 
systematically document how 
LGBT persons are impacted 
by 
more 
subtle 
day-to-day 
experiences of devaluation and 
marginalization at work,” Cech 
said. “We hope this study gives 
visibility to these issues and 
voice to LGBT persons who 
encounter these issues at work.”
LSA and Music, Theatre & 
Dance senior Dylan Genouw, 
a 
member 
of 
the 
LGBT 
community, said in an email to 
The Daily he noticed gender and 
sexuality-based discrimination 
in his restaurant job.

Former priest 
 
charged with 
sexual assault 
of minor in A2

Ex-St. Thomas priest 
Timothy Crowley
faces up to life in
prison if convicted 

Timothy M. Crowley, a former priest at St. 
Thomas the Apostle Catholic Church in Ann 
Arbor, was arrested on May 23 in Tempe, AZ, 
according to Maricopa County jail records. 
The next day, Michigan Attorney General 
Dana Nessel announced Crowley was one 
of five Michigan Catholic priests her office 
charged with criminal sexual misconduct.
Crowley, 69, was charged in Washtenaw 
County with four felony counts of first-
degree criminal sexual conduct, with a 
maximum sentence of life in prison, and four 
counts of second-degree criminal sexual 
conduct, with a maximum sentence of 15 
years in prison. He is accused of assaulting 
a minor boy for about eight years while at St. 
Thomas from 1987 to 1990.
The charges come after months of 
investigation into sexual abuse by Michigan 
clergy inside the Catholic Church. The 
investigation was started in August 2018 
by Nessel’s predecessor, former Attorney 
General Bill Schuette, following a report 
exposing widespread sexual abuse in the 
Pennsylvania Catholic Church.
All charges against Crowley fall within 
the statute of limitations because he 
has not been a Michigan resident since 
1995. Prosecutors will move ahead with 
proceedings.
According to Nessel, all five cases began 
as tips from the Attorney General’s sexual 
abuse hotline, which she said has received 
more than 450 tips. The tips were then 
corroborated by interviews with victims 
and information found in the hundreds 
of thousands of documents seized from 
Michigan’s seven Catholic dioceses last 
October.

City Council talks 
rezoning projects

Council examines 
affodability, scale
of proposals

On Monday evening, the Ann 
Arbor City Council discussed 
several 
rezoning 
requests, 
voting to deny rezoning for the 
Brightdawn Village development 
and to approve rezoning for the 
Broadway Park development.
Gil-Ad Schwartz, one of the 
developers behind the Brightdawn 
Village proposal, explained the 
land on Burton Road is private 
property. 
Thus, 
according 
to 
Schwartz, he is allowed to build a 
120-unit apartment building.
Rezoning a land parcel would 
assign different permissible uses 
and restrictions on the property. 
The 
proposed 
conditional 
rezoning 
would 
allow 
the 
Schwartz family to build 160 
units, under the stipulation that 
the additional 40 be affordable 

housing 
units. 
Twenty 
units 
would be restricted for people 
earning 60 percent of the area 
median income or below, and 
20 units would be restricted for 
people earning 80 percent or 
below.
Tom Covert of Midwestern 
Consulting, the civil engineering 
firm behind the project, also 
emphasized the development will 
will be equipped for residents with 
disabilities and senior residents.
In its report to the council, 
the city’s Planning Commission 
recommended a denial of the 
rezoning request.
During the public comment 
sections, 
many 
residents 
at 
the 
meeting 
also 
spoke 
in 
opposition 
to 
the 
rezoning. 
Residents 
expressed 
concern 
over the density of the units 
and 
additional 
traffic 
the 
development could bring, which 
they said would be dangerous for 
children in the area.

Locals head 
downtown for 
annual festival

On Sunday afternoon, the 
annual Taste of Ann Arbor 
festival brought live music and 
over 30 local restaurants serving 
an array of entrees, drinks and 
desserts to South Main Street.
Restaurants, like Gratzi, Palio 
and Aventura, had tents set up 
with a couple of signature plates 
available for patrons to sample. 
From 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., unique 
Indian, 
Italian 
and 
Spanish 
cuisines were readily made for 
each hungry passerby.
The six-hour event provided an 
opportunity for residents from all 
over Michigan to taste a variety 
of local restaurants for a much 
lower price. Community member 
Vince Pope said the wide range of 
selections is part of what makes 
the festival so enjoyable. 
“It’s my first time here, and 
I just tried octopus for the first 
time,” Pope said. “That’s what 
I like about it. You get to try 
different things that you would 
normally never try.”
Unlike Pope, Cassie McAllister 
from Troy has attended the 
festival before.
“I love that I can try a lot of 
different places that I normally 
would not go for a full dinner, 
but I can get a little sampling, so 
I can see if it’s a place I want to 

go to in the future,” McAllister 
said. “I also just love getting a ton 
of different foods at once rather 
than one thing.”
In 
addition, 
there 
were 
options for those with dietary 
restrictions. 
Karissa 
Urban, 
Eastern 
Michigan 
University 
student, was surprised by the 
variety of food.
“There are a lot more vegan 
options than I expected, so that’s 
cool,” Urban said. 
Jessie Kinney, the head baker of 
French bakery Le Bon Macaron, 
said it was Le Bon’s second year 
participating in the event. Kinney 
said she returned to Taste of Ann 
Arbor because it is a great way to 
meet more potential customers 
and work alongside other Ann 
Arbor businesses.
“It’s just good to get exposure 
for people that might not be 
walking around Fourth Street 
or don’t know as much about 
macarons,” 
Kinney 
said. 
“Hopefully more people know 
about us now.”
Kinesiology sophomore Eliya 
Gelb said the event introduced 
her to local businesses she had 
not known about previously.
“It’s really nice you get too see 
all of these places here,” Gelb 
said. “I didn’t know half of these 
restaurants existed.”
With food priced between 
$1 and $4, Engineering junior 
Lindsay Llende said the price 
allowed her to taste dishes from 
multiple restaurants.

More than 75 Washtenaw 
County residents made the 
trek from Ypsilanti to Ann 
Arbor 
Saturday 
morning 
during the second annual 
Bridging 23 Unity Walk.
Organizer Robin Stephens 
said the 8-mile walk was cre-
ated to unify the east and 
west sides of Washtenaw 
County, which faces dispari-
ties in job access, economics 
and education.
“I think it’s so important 
for us to really connect as an 
entire community so we’re 
all responsible for each other 
and we have to help each 
other,” Stephens said. “If it 
means we have to get out 
and walk … so that we really 
get to know and understand 
each other, then I am willing 
to put these walks together 
for the rest of my days.”
Stephens, an Ann Arbor-
based 
criminal 
defense 
attorney, said she attended 
an event at the Dispute Reso-
lution Center that challenged 
her to create unity within 
her community. Inspired by 
her past participation in the 
Susan G. Komen Race for 
the Cure, Stephens decided 

to create the Unity Walk to 
encourage dialogue between 
county residents who may 
not have met otherwise.
“I had done the Susan G. 
Komen breast cancer walk 
three times prior, and I knew 
from my own experiences 
walking with thousands of 
people that I did not know, 
that by the end of that walk 
I knew some of them much 
more intimately,” Stephens 
said. “We were walking and 
we were bonding and we 
were talking, and … I really 
built a bond with those peo-
ple.”
Participants began the 
day at the Ypsilanti District 
Library. They took Washt-
enaw Avenue all the way to 
Ann Arbor and concluded 
at the Ann Arbor African 
American Downtown Festi-
val.
A rally with multiple 
speakers from the com-
munity preceded the walk. 
Stephens began the rally by 
introducing Jeff Gabrielson, 
vice president of the Asso-
ciation for Youth Empower-
ment.
Gabrielson said the goal 
of the Unity Walk was to get 
to know other community 
members on a personal level.

“What we see is that when 
we get to know each other as 
human beings, there’s a third 
wave that occurs,” Gabriel-
son said. “Our intent with 
Bridging 23 is to look at dif-
ferent ways to bring people 
together.”
Ypsilanti 
Mayor 
Beth 
Bashert also spoke to partici-
pants about fixing income, 
education and health care 
disparities within the coun-
ty.
“We all know that, in our 
area, we have disparities, 
and we talk about them all 
the time; disparities from 
one side of our county to the 
other,” Bashert said. “We 
know what the problems 
are, and I’m going to tell you 
what the solutions are. The 
solutions are right here.”
Bashert said solutions to 
issues of disparity must be 
solved regionally and that 
unification helps the county 
grow stronger.
U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, 
D-Mich, commended par-
ticipants on their work in 
bringing both sides of the 
county together.
“This walk is a symbol of 
people caring, and we need 
to get a lot more people 
engaged because we are one 

community,” Dingell said. 
“Together, we can make a 
difference.”
Stephens closed the rally 
by challenging participants 
to meet at least two people 
during the walk they did not 
previously know. During the 
walk to Ann Arbor, partici-
pants conversed with those 
around them and did not use 
their cell phones.
Eastern Michigan Uni-
versity senior Sarah Khan 
said she was encouraged by 
a friend to take part in the 
Unity Walk. She said the 
walk let her see Ypsilanti 
and Ann Arbor from a new 
perspective and helped her 
meet people from across the 
county.
“I think it’s really cool to 
see people come together for 
things like this,” Khan said. 
“I would like to see a little 
more diversity, like genera-
tional diversity, but as far as 
the people that I met, they 
were all really cool.”
In the future, Stephens 
said she hopes to extend 
the walk to reach other sur-
rounding Washtenaw Coun-
ty communities.

On Jan. 23, after nearly a 
year of deliberation among 
University 
of 
Michigan 
administrators, Duo Two-
Factor Authentication was 
introduced 
for 
student 
employees, faculty and staff. 
Duo, a program that aims 
to protect a user’s data by 
requiring they log in to web-
sites like Canvas and Wol-
verine Access using both a 
password and an alternate 
device, is mandatory for 
those employed by the Uni-
versity on all three campuses.
 LSA sophomore Charlotte 
Weisman, a former employee 
at Maizie’s Kitchen and Mar-
ket in the League, said she 
was accustomed to programs 
that use dual-factor verifica-
tion and found the process of 
setting it up fairly simple. 
“There are a lot of plat-
forms that use dual-factor 
authentication, like Facebook 
and Instagram where they 
text you a code or some-
thing,” Weisman said. “Ini-
tially, I was a little annoyed 
because I was like ‘Oh, I have 
to set this up, I don’t know if 
this is going to be a hassle,’ 
but I found it pretty straight-
forward and they kind of 
walk you through the steps.”
Duo Security, an internet-
safety provider with offices 
in three states and the Unit-
ed Kingdom, was founded 
in 2010 by University alumi 
Dug Song and Jon Oberhe-
ide. According to the Duo 
website, the company serves 
over 14,000 customers in 100 
countries, including larger 
brands like Yelp and Face-

book. In August 2018, Cisco 
Systems Inc. acquired Duo in 
a $2.35 billion deal.
According to Ravi Pendse, 
vice president of information 
technology and chief infor-
mation officer, multi-factor 
authentication has existed in 
some form at the University 
since 2005. Pendse said Duo’s 
2FA provides more extensive 
security coverage than pre-
vious verification programs 
because it is based in a smart-
phone app rather than an 
external hard drive.
“In 2005 and even before, 
when people used other 
forms of verification, they 
would not use most of the 
modern tools that we use 
today — tools that we carry in 
our pocket or purses,” Pendse 
said. “A lot of the things that 
we do, we do them through 
smartphone … so smartphone 
has replaced many things, 
including the two-factor veri-
fication that can be used for 
using Duo.”
Most 2FA users verify their 
identity using the Duo Securi-
ty app and their smartphone, 
Pendse said. Student employ-
ees and faculty, however, 
can also request a hardware 
“token” from the University 
that plugs into their computer 
for when they are traveling or 
do not have reliable service.
“One of our challenges 
was communication — let-
ting people know that while 
smartphone is the most pop-
ular way to use Duo, that’s 
not the only way, there are 
many ways you can use Duo,” 
Pendse said.

RAMISA ROB | OP-ED
A 

common post revolving 
around the internet right 
now 
that 
condemns 
the near total abortion ban in 
Alabama states, “Men shouldn’t 
be making laws about women’s 
bodies” has been flying around 
the internet recently. But the 
deadlocked 
abortion 
debate 
is much more complex than 
old, white men versus women 
when it results in a concerted, 
national 
effort 
to 
get 
the 
Supreme Court to overturn Roe 
v. Wade. Missouri also recently 
established anti-abortion laws, 
and female state Sen. Kim 
LaSata, 
R-Sturgis 
proposed 
abortion bans in her state and 
heartlessly 
said 
abortions 
“should be painful.”
Governor 
of 
Alabama 
Kay 
Ivey, 
also 
a 
woman, 
signed Alabama’s bill citing 
Alabamians’ deeply held belief 
that every life is precious and 
that every life is a sacred gift 
from God.” Pew finds that the 
gender 
difference 
between 
those for and against abortion is 
trivial. To then say the pro-life 
movement is indicative of men 
pushing opinions on women 
would 
prove 
unproductive. 
Instead, “God” seems to be the 
point of focus for most pro-life 
campaigns. But it is ridiculous 
that such abortion bans can be 
passed by a majority of senators 
in a nation that has a ‘free 
exercise clause’ enshrined in 
its constitution, fundamentally 
prohibiting Congress and states 
from furthering or deterring 

religious beliefs or practices.
The juxtaposition between 
anti-abortion state laws and the 
First Amendment produces a 
self-contradictory legal system. 
However, the abortion state 
laws are not yet in effect, and 
will likely reach the Supreme 
Court, where Brett Kavanaugh 
will get a chance to prove his 
competence 
in 
safeguarding 
inclusive justice. Regardless, 
American 
society 
needs 
to 
engage 
in 
a 
constructive 
conversation about abortion.
Conservative pundits are fond 
of saying “Facts don’t care about 
your feelings.” It seems that 
they presume exemption from 
their own statement. Pro-life 
conservatives ignore a number 
of scientific facts because, in 
reality, they “view” and “feel” 
that 
abortion 
constitutes 
murder. The assertion that a 
two-week-old fetus amounts to 
the same humanness of a full 
grown baby is contradicted” by 
medical evidence that suggests 
fetuses cannot live unsupported 
without a respirator, even at 21 
weeks. Pro-life campaigns argue 
fetuses can feel pain, although 
scientific evidence tells us that, 
until at least 24 weeks, fetuses 
cannot 
feel 
anything 
like 
pain. With the lack of science, 
banking on a strict perception of 
morality to criminalize abortion 
casts infeasible restrictions on 
fertile women, especially rape 
victims, and ironically becomes 
unjust and immoral.
The solution is actually quite 

simple: If you don’t support 
abortions, don’t have one. You 
don’t have to dig your fingers 
into strangers’ lives and provide 
unsolicited 
virtue 
signaling. 
Considerations of what should 
be criminalized by law must be 
logically based on human rights, 
economic standards and ethical 
or 
unethical 
conduct 
that 
endangers or ensures public 
safety. You can be a Christian, 
Muslim, 
Jew, 
Buddhist 
or 
Scientologist, but your religion 
shouldn’t 
matter 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
your 
“advocacy” 
pertaining 
to 
policies 
and 
politics. That only makes sense 
if your nation ratifies religious 
jurisdiction, 
but 
the 
U.S. 
Constitution explicitly does not. 
So, I challenge conservatives 
to 
explain 
why 
abortion 
should 
be 
banned 
without 
unconstitutionally bringing God 
into the conversation.
When 
navigating 
through 
what has today become the dead-
end abortion debate, we must 
highlight that pro-choice means 
you can choose to and choose 
not to have an abortion. Pro-
choice not only aims to protect 
those who choose abortion, but 
also those who do not, while 
pro-life attacks the choice of 
those who have abortions. I 
understand that many women 
hold religious convictions and 
will 
not 
pursue 
abortions. 
What I cannot respect is when 
individuals disparage women 
who have had abortions for very 
personal, complex reasons only 

to validate their anti-abortion 
viewpoints.
Though abortion affects a 
woman’s 
body, 
reproductive 
rights concern both sexes. But 
the fact is that men can easily 
escape the responsibility of 
being involved in a pregnancy or 
raising a child, as the law does 
nothing to ethically counter 
that. Many single mothers raise 
children 
through 
financial 
challenges, 
and 
oftentimes 
children end up in foster homes. 
And I’m sure many rapists 
would not like to raise children. 
So if the law forces a 11-year-
old rape victim to deliver a 
child, a fair bill should also be 
passed that requires rapists 
to finance and account for the 
entire pregnancy, along with 
their prison sentence. If nothing 
is done in that regard, we are 
legalizing vile misogyny.
A rapist can now face a lesser 
sentence than a doctor who 
performs an abortion on a rape 
victim, a woman who became 
pregnant without her consent. 
No 
one 
should 
inhumanely 
force 
victims 
to 
physically 
carry what happened to them 
against their will. So, to those 
diehard pro-life advocates who 
believe they’re doing the right 
thing with these laws that 
marginalize vulnerable people, 
it’s time to refresh those ethics 
lessons.
Pennsylvania 
Rep. 
Tim 
Murphy has been “pro-life,” and 
recently resigned after reports 
found that he had asked his 

extra-marital partner to get an 
abortion, highlighting a clear 
hypocrisy. The tragedy here 
is that abortion has become a 
partisan issue — a denominator 
in the clash of the liberals and 
conservatives — which, in this 
case, seems to mean abandoning 
the sense of logic and morality 
to fit oneself into a political 
tribe. Maybe I’m wrong, but 
where’s the logical consistency 
for conservatives who are pro-
life, pro-death penalty and pro-
gun?
Pope Francis himself has 
recently 
argued 
the 
death 
penalty is a violation of the 
right of life. How can Alabama 
be pro-murder and anti-murder 
at the same time? Shooting 
incidents 
have 
been 
killing 
youths across the nation for 
decades, 
and 
teenagers 
are 
arguably “more living” than 
fetuses. Yet, lawmakers cannot 
implement 
common-sense 
gun laws because Americans 
need to bear arms for “self-
defense.” How many people 
have used guns for self-defense 
and 
how 
many 
have 
used 
them to murder innocents? 
I challenge conservatives to 
straightforwardly explain the 
contradictions 
with 
“facts.” 
It’s time for conservatives to 
answer these questions and to 
apply their logic and humanity 
to the abortion debate.

t’s officially June, which means 
two things: The Peony Garden 
in Nichols Arboretum is due to 
bloom any day, and it’s time to cel-
ebrate Pride. LGBTQ+ Pride month 
has gone through many evolutions 
since its origins in New York in 
1970, where the first Pride was held 
to commemorate a year since the 
Stonewall riots. The Stonewall riots 
are a historical moment often cred-
ited as the beginning of the mod-
ern gay rights movement, and were 
bravely led by transgender women 
of color, including famous activists 
such as Sylvia Rivera and Marsha 
P. Johnson. The impact of these 
women and other gay rights activ-
ists was the harnessing of LGBTQ+ 
individuals’ political power, which 
translated into the creation of 
LGBTQ+ Pride month. 
Pride began as a political dem-
onstration, where the voices of the 
LGBTQ+ 
community 
demanded 
equal rights and protections. Pride 
still serves as a crucial political tool, 
pushing the importance of LGBTQ+ 
freedoms and safety — and this is 
especially salient when acknowl-
edging the tangible barriers still 
stand in front of LGBTQ+ Ameri-
cans. Political and social threats still 
exist. An individual can still be fired 
in 26 states because of sexual orien-
tation or gender identity. According 
to 2017 FBI hate crime statistics, a 
surge in hate crimes has dispropor-
tionately affected LGBTQ+ individ-
uals, and even more so those with 
intersectional marginalized identi-
ties. These issues are deserving of 
political attention and advocacy, 
but gradually this political focus of 
Pride has expanded into what it is 
widely viewed as today: a celebra-
tion.
This isn’t a plea to turn every 
visible moment as an LGBTQ+ 
individual into a rally cry against 
oppression. Pride can and should 
be used to celebrate queer life. 
Pride can and should be enjoyable. 
It exemplifies the importance and 
impact of LGBTQ+ people across 
the spectrum, and brings the com-
munity together in a way that allows 
individuals to praise their own and 
each other’s identities. What Pride 
shouldn’t be promoting, however, 
is the commercialization of these 
identities to benefit corporations 
and promote half-baked awareness 
of the issues.
Something 
that 
I’ve 
learned 
in my time as a Communications 
Studies major is that any aspect of 
your identity can and will be uti-
lized as a market. During Pride, the 

LGBTQ+ community becomes easy 
to tap, with newseeds and store-
fronts flooded with rainbow flags, 
while marketers clearly know that 
the community’s buying power has 
exceeded $1 trillion. 
At first glance, the idea of brands 
incorporating products that support 
LGBTQ+ visibility into their lines 
is commendable. Oftentimes, these 
products come with some social ben-
efit. For example, H&M’s Pride col-
lection “Stay True, Stay You” donates 
10 percent of the global sales price 
to the work of the United Nations’ 
Free & Equal campaign. Again, this 
is seemingly mutually beneficial: 
I get a cool new rainbow bodysuit 
while simultaneously donating to a 
significant cause. But the implica-
tions of this type of consumerism 
get a bit dicey when considering 
that H&M has several high-volume 
factories in China, a country with 
historic 
anti-LGBTQ 
legislation 
(despite very recent promises to the 
United Nations to address LGBTQ+ 
rights). This type of commercial 
social blindness is consistently seen 
throughout Pride, like when the 
biggest sponsors of city-wide Pride 
events are contributing greatly to 
issues such as income inequality, an 
issue affecting marginalized (espe-
cially those that are intersectional) 
identities at disproportionate rates. 
With the growth of positive senti-
ment regarding the LGBTQ+ com-
munity, brands frequently attempt 
to jump into these celebrations to 
make a profit with little found inter-
est in the actual issues.
Wearing or purchasing Pride 
merchandise from a big corporation 
is not something to be intrinsically 
ashamed of. Sometimes, corpora-
tions have a piece of clothing that 
you feel represents your version of 
Pride, and it’s okay to indulge that 
purchase. The issue arises when 
Pride becomes a market compe-
tition for who can earn the most 
LGBTQ+ dollars without consis-
tently supporting the community. 
Consumers need to hold companies 
accountable for their political and 
monetary actions, and the impact 
of these decisions on the LGBTQ+ 
community. While Pride should 
be a time to celebrate, the political 
origins of the holiday and the ongo-
ing needs of the community should 
remain at the forefront of one’s 
thoughts. Now, go buy a rainbow 
t-shirt from a local LGBTQ+ sup-
porting business, and happy Pride.

PHILIP EIL | OP-ED

W

hen I was a junior at the 
University of Michigan, 
I experienced the worst 
panic attack of my life. At the time, I 
was on spring break from a semester 
abroad in Scotland, midway through 
a long-planned trip through Spain, 
France and Italy. It was, in theory, 
the highlight of my semester. But 
symptoms that I had begun to 
experience back at school in Ann 
Arbor had gotten worse. And on this 
trip they boiled over, culminating 
in a moment in Florence when I 
became convinced I was dying, 
which sent my heart racing and my 
mind whirring out of control. That 
moment was followed by aftershocks 
in the following weeks, including one 
day back in Scotland where I asked 
my dorm administrator to call an 
ambulance because I thought I was 
having a heart attack. The EMTs 
arrived and determined that I was 
fine, which added a big dose of 
embarrassment to my distress.
I share this story now as a 34 year-
old who only recently started taking 
my mental health seriously. Despite 
flare-ups of anxiety and depression 
in my twenties, I spent the decade 
after college burying myself in my 
work as a journalist and teacher 
and ignoring these issues when they 
arose. It took another crisis in 2017 — 
a case of burnout and depression that 
left me unable to work for weeks — to 
really wake me up. I’ve since spent 
a lot of time taking better care of 
myself, and also writing about men-
tal health topics, including anxiety, 
depression, burnout, therapy, toxic 
masculinity and suicide. The brain is 
now one of my beats, as a journalist.
Part of this journey has involved 
realizing just how much the college-
aged me could have benefited from 
the knowledge I have now. If I had 
a time machine, I might send it back 
to Bursley or the Brown Jug or the 
Big House, circa the mid 2000s, to 
whisper a few words in my own ear, 
and save myself a lot of future misery. 
Alas, I can’t do that. But I can write 
something for The Daily, and per-
haps be a bit of help to you.
The first thing I would share with 
the younger me — and to you, my 
fellow Wolverines — is the simple 
message that you are not alone. As 
a reporter on mental health, I’ve 
learned that anxiety disorders affect 
some 40 million adults in the U.S. 
and that, worldwide, so many people 
struggle with depression that the 
World Health Organization calls it 
the world’s leading cause of disabil-
ity. While mental health struggles 
can feel intensely isolating, that feel-

ing is an illusion. This is a huge part of 
being human, and there is much sol-
ace to be found in remembering that, 
and hearing other people’s stories.
I would also add that there is 
absolutely nothing to be ashamed of 
about struggling with your mental 
health. You wouldn’t be down on 
yourself for getting the flu or pull-
ing a muscle during a pickup basket-
ball game, because neither of those 
things would mean you’re a bad or 
a weak person. And the same idea 
applies to your brain. Having anxi-
ety or depression means that you’re 
someone with a human body that is 
prone to occasionally malfunction. 
It also means that we live in a world 
with countless mental health-aggra-
vating triggers, from social media 
to climate change to racism to mass 
shootings to dating apps to political 
chaos and so much more. 

If your mind is telling you that 
there is something to be ashamed 
of because of a mental health issue, 
that is a symptom of the issues them-
selves — or perhaps an outgrowth of 
our culture’s pervasive and totally 
unnecessary stigma. Confronting 
that stigma in yourself and others is 
a huge step toward becoming a men-
tal health-literate and overall good 
person.
College, for me, was the first time 
when mental health symptoms real-
ly started to affect my quality of life. 
And if you’re experiencing similar 
turbulence, the good news is that 
there is help for you. There are sup-
port groups, medications, therapists, 
self-help books, TED Talks, mindful-
ness apps — the list goes on. Every-
one’s mental health regimen is going 
to look a bit different, according to 
their schedule and needs and budget. 
And it may take you some time to fig-
ure out what works best for you. I’m 
still tweaking mine, years after first 
seeking help.
But the basic fact is you are sur-
rounded by time-tested, research-
backed, highly-accessible (and fully 
anonymous) ways for you to feel 
better. The University of Michigan 
isn’t just an athletic and academic 

powerhouse; it’s also a major center 
for mental health treatment. At Uni-
versity Health Service’s online hub 
for mental health, you’ll find links 
to all kinds of options and resources, 
including the office of Counseling 
and Psychological Services, well-
ness coaching, the MiTalk and 
Campus Mind Works databases and 
info about on-campus counseling. 
Taking steps to invest in your own 
mental wellbeing in college will 
place you so far ahead of the game 
here at school, and in the post-col-
lege “real world.” Plenty of people go 
their whole lives without doing this, 
and it’s something I wish I’d done 
years sooner.
There is a quote I like from the 
pioneering Swiss psychoanalyst Carl 
Jung: “Until you make the uncon-
scious conscious, it will direct your 
life and you will call it fate.” After my 
experiences in the last couple years, 
I now look back at college (and many 
years after) as a time when my life 
was significantly steered by fears and 
insecurities and depressive spells 
and unacknowledged pain from 
my childhood and adolescence. The 
choice to finally meet these issues 
head-on and start unpacking that 
unconscious was a way of taking 
more control over my own life.
Far from being an admission of 
weakness, addressing my mental 
health in recent years has been one 
of the biggest sources of strength 
and growth and wisdom and 
authenticity and happiness in my 
life. I go to therapy every two weeks. 
I’ve cut down on drinking. I take 
more frequent breaks from work. 
I’ve cultivated new hobbies and self-
care practices, and taken countless 
other large and small measures. In 
the process, I’ve become a better 
teacher, a better journalist, a better 
friend and a better member of my 
family and community. I’m simply a 
better version of me. (Note that “bet-
ter” isn’t “perfect.” I still have bad 
days, and weeks, and even months, 
and that is OK).
I hold the University of Michi-
gan professors in the highest 
regard. And yet, while you’re in 
Ann Arbor, the work you do in 
a therapist’s office, or support 
group, or mindfulness practice, or 
any other mental wellness-focused 
space, is just as important as any-
thing you’ll learn in a classroom. 
After all, your college education is 
only as useful as the health of the 
mind that holds it.

Rocketman

Paramount Pictures

Ann Arbor 20 + 

IMAX, GT6 Quality 
16, the State Theatre

Taron Egerton (“Kingsman: The 

Golden Circle”) doesn’t consider 
“Rocketman” a biopic. While the 
story revolves around the life and 
music of Elton John, Egerton himself 
filling John’s (platform) shoes, he has 
a point: “Rocketman,” with its all-out 
musical numbers and its elegant bal-
ance of fantasy with realism, isn’t like 
the other biopics.

At the same time, it seems impos-

sible to discuss “Rocketman” without 
invoking another biopic in particu-
lar. Yes, you (probably) guessed it: 
“Bohemian Rhapsody.” Its subjects, 
Queen and their legendary frontman 
Freddie Mercury, have hardly left 
the musician-biopic limelight since 
the film’s Nov. 2018 release, though 
they’ll soon be forced to share the 
space with an increasing number of 
artists. To that end, we have films 
highlighting the lives and/or music 
of Boy George, Aretha Franklin, Judy 
Garland and Céline Dion lined up in 
the near future. In spite of the critical 
and popular success of “Bohemian,” 
however, I would urge the filmmakers 
in charge of telling these beloved art-
ists’ stories to look instead to “Rocket-
man,” if they’re interested in pulling 
off more than their artist’s highlight 
reel.

Where “Bohemian” had trouble 

deciding if Freddie Mercury or 
Queen’s songs were the point of the 
film, “Rocketman” never took the 
man behind the music or his story for 
granted. Where “Bohemian” reduced 
Mercury’s queer identity to a plot 
point, “Rocketman” treated John’s 

homosexuality like it was, oh, I don’t 
know, part of his being a person. In 
short, Dexter Fletcher (“Eddie the 
Eagle”), who took over direction of 
“Bohemian Rhapsody” after Bryan 
Singer was accused of sexual assault 
and was on board for all of “Rocket-
man,” seems to have learned from the 
former’s errors. 

But make no mistake: “Rocket-

man” is not “Bohemian” 2.0. Return-
ing to Egerton’s sentiment, the film 
should not be defined strictly in the 
ways it holds up against other biopics. 
Its innovative employment of musi-
cal and fantasy genre techniques and 

its confident foregrounding of queer 
sexuality are due singular praise.

The musical lended them inge-

nious transition scenes, hinging on 
overlapping lyrics, and at best com-
mendable, at worst forgivable flashes 
forward in the film’s timeline. It’s 
extraordinary how much time they 
covered without oversimplifying any 
events in John’s life (the most notable 
exception being his marriage former 
wife Renate Blauel, but I’m not going 
to gripe about a film that respected a 
queer character refusing to dwell on 
his brief collapse under the weight of 
heteronormative pressure). 

It is also extraordinary what the 

fantastical elements managed to rep-
resent. Each song is magically trans-
ported into the era of its making. 
Gravity is suspended during John’s 
first performance at The Troubadour, 
as John levitates above the piano 
bench and the enthused crowd rises 
along with him. Never have I seen 
those imprecise feelings — the ill-ease 
that comes with revisiting our bygone 
work, the floating sensation you expe-
rience when a musician just moves 
you — so precisely captured on screen.

What excels the most about “Rock-

etman,” however, is not its visual 
splendor or “La La Land”-caliber 
song-and-dance. It’s that the movie 
treats each of its characters fairly. 
How many films could say the same? 
Villains and heroes are formulaic for 
a reason. For a completely different 
reason — above all, its abiding belief in 
the goodness and subsequent redeem-
ability of all people — “Rocketman” 
pays no heed to these formulae and 
dares to criticize its protagonist while 
being sympathetic about why we end 
up hurting the people we’re supposed 
to love. We see this in another of the 
film’s innovations: Remaking solos 
into duets, trios and the like. Picture 
this: John sings the opening lyrics to 
“I Want Love,” when suddenly, the 
people he’s singing about claim some 
of the lines. His flawed mother (Bryce 
Dallas Howard, “Jurassic World”), 
his cold father (Steven Mackintosh, 
“Urban Hymn”), his steadfast grand-
mother (Gemma Jones “God’s Own 
Country”). These thoughtful recre-
ations remind us that we sing along to 
songs about real people.

When I received Ocean Vuong’s 

debut novel “On Earth We’re Brief-
ly Gorgeous” in the mail, I read the 
jacket description to my mother 
immediately. It began, “‘On Earth 
We’re Briefly Gorgeous’ is a letter 
from a son to a mother who cannot 
read.” She stopped me there, ask-
ing if the book was a first edition, 
and told me to keep it safe. Even 
from that one sentence, not even 
having read the book, my mother 
knew that Vuong’s writing was 
special. Having read it, I know 
that is true, and 
that his writing is 
beyond special — 
it is a distillation 
of emotion that 
only a poet could 
achieve, 
captur-

ing the intensity 
of 
familial 
and 

romantic love in 
a way that’s near-
ly impossible to 
explain. From the 
first words of the 
jacket to the last of 
his acknowledge-
ments, Vuong has 
created a world of his own within 
the confines of a novel, pushing his 
readers so deeply into the experi-
ence of his characters that it feels 
like they’ve lived it themselves. 

“On Earth We’re Briefly Gor-

geous” is a book about the immi-
grant experience, and it is also a 
book about the queer experience. 
It is a book about a son’s love for 
his mother, for his grandmother, 
for his family’s homeland and the 
home they built away from it. In 
another writer’s hands, this would 
surely be too much to address in 
one novel. But Vuong, in his first 
foray into fiction, is more than 
capable of handling all of these 
things. In truth, the realities of 
being human are not easily swal-
lowable, and certainly more com-
plicated than we wish they were. 
Vuong knows this well and weaves 
each aspect of his semi-autobio-
graphical story through the lens 
of personhood, making the big 
picture distinguishable among its 

million puzzle pieces. 

The book begins at the onset of 

narrator Little Dog’s childhood, 
as he collects scattered memo-
ries of his mother to share with 
her. Vuong’s skill as a poet (hav-
ing won the T.S. Eliot Prize in 
2017) is immediate in these first 
pages. Through a mix of abstract 
description and fleeting emotion, 
he stabilizes memory despite its 
ephemeral nature and invites the 
reader in to remember with him, 
his mother and his younger self. 

“I am writing because they told 

me to never start a sentence with 
because,” Vuong writes, “But I 
wasn’t trying to make a sentence 
— I was trying to break free.” 

“On Earth” is cen-
tered around the 
confusion of this 
search 
for 
free-

dom, revealing the 
interplay between 
the 
“why”s 
and 

“because”s of a dif-
ficult life. He can’t 
start 
a 
sentence 

with 
“because,” 

but Vuong is a mas-
ter of explanation; 
even if it isn’t in 
the way a reader 
expects. 

Though 
Little 

Dog is not exactly Vuong, or vice 
versa, the intimacy between the 
author and character is palpable. 
It’s almost like Vuong is trying to 
describe how his reflection looks 
in a foxed mirror; there are some 
parts of Little Dog that are the 
author completely, but the others 
are somewhere in the middle of 
them both.

It’s this foggy quality of mem-

ory that colors the entirety of “On 
Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous,” 
almost like a character of its own. 
Of course, it affects Little Dog’s 
memories of his mother, but also 
her own recollections of her life 
and those of her mother, too. In a 
narrative heavy with their family’s 
story of immigration from Viet-
nam, this emphasis on memory is 
also tied to Little Dog’s relation-
ship with a heritage fraught with 
trauma.

Amid earth-shaking thunder-

storms and sweltering heat, New 
York City’s Governors Ball start-
ed and ended with a bang — liter-
ally. The third and final day of the 
outdoor music festival on Ran-
dall’s Island came to a close with 
performance cancellations, a tor-
rential downpour and hundreds 
stranded as they awaited a break 
in the storm. But before Mother 
Nature arrived in all her won-
drous fury (some cosmic karma, 
perhaps, for all the littered beer 
cans), there was Saturday night. 
And Saturday night at the Gover-
nors Ball was glorious.

With several stages and an 

extensive list of performances 
to choose from, the Governors 
stage in particular beckoned with 
promises of Kacey Musgraves’ 
sweetheart country, The 1975’s 
techno rock ‘n’ roll and Florence 
+ the Machine’s otherworldly 
performance. 

Musgraves took to stage first, 

adding a dose of country flair to 
the evening lineup. Dressed in a 
matching floral top and pants, 
her outfit was reminiscent of the 
rhinestone-studded 
glamor 
of 

previous country icons. Standing 
atop the Governors stage, Mus-
graves put on a show, the crowd 
eagerly singing along to her mel-

low tunes. As she serenaded the 
sizable audience with her hit 
“High Time,” fans could be seen 
“swimming” through the crowd 
in an amusing display of misheard 
lyrics, mistaking the line “It’s 
high time” for “It’s high tide.” 

Musgraves’s songs, although 

beautiful, were ill-suited for an 
outdoor festival; much of her per-
formance lacked the electricity 
and energy needed to amp up a 
crowd. However, Musgraves put 
forth a good effort to engage with 
fans, throwing in some admirable 
(but flat) remarks about the start 
of Pride mMonth. Her heart of 
gold, too, was on full display as 
she reflected on promoting posi-
tivity and love — the belief that 
love can find a way fueling her 
music-making. But as fun as it 
was to “yee-haw” and “hell -nah” 
alongside Musgraves as she tried 
to add a spark to an eager but 
stifled crowd, the performance 
itself was ultimately lackluster. 

Where 
Musgraves 
failed, 

however, British pop-rock band 
The 1975 succeeded. The band 
rolled in like thunder and struck 
the crowd with lighting. Every-
thing about the performance 
was 
energetic 
and 
colorful: 

Behind the band, a kaleidoscope 
of lights and images played on 
stage, mirrored by the setting 
sun, which illuminated the sky 
with rainbow hues (a natural 
phenomenon that seemed a cos-

mic salute to Pride month). 

The smell of stale beer and 

press of sweaty bodies aside, as 
The 1975 played the crowd in an 
almost sinful display of musical 
mastery, everything was over-
whelmingly beautiful. A “New 
York moment” is what I would 
call that Saturday night: a rare 
experience of the intimate, innate 
connection between strangers in 
New York City. 

Lead singer Matt Healy was a 

sight to behold, dancing, grinding 
and gyrating like a pro — at risk of 
offending the king of rock ‘n’ roll, 
Healy could have given Elvis Pre-
sley a run for his money. About 
three songs into the band’s hour 
long set, Healy stripped some lay-
ers off to the animalistic cheers 
of the audience. “I know, we 
keep getting better, right?” Healy 
called out, at once arrogant and 
delightful. The second half of the 
set saw Healy’s swagger on stage, 
accompanied by a cigarette in one 
hand and a cocktail in the other: a 
true man of the people. 

What was most enthralling 

about The 1975 was the deep 
sincerity with which they per-
formed each song. Nothing about 
their performance suggested they 
were going through the motions. 
No, Healy and the rest of his 
beloved band made every song an 
independent, emotional experi-
ence. By the time the band finally 
left the stage, the audience vis-

ibly deflated, a mix of disappoint-
ment and utter exhaustion. It was 
like The 1975 had held the crowd 
in some hypnotic state, where 
release was only granted when 
the band was good and done. 

The 
1975, 
without 
doubt, 

improved upon Musgraves’s ear-
lier performance by leaps and 
bounds. As the clock ticked on 
and the final rays of sunshine 
flickered out, Governors Ball 
came to a quiet pause. Or, more 
accurately, it was the calm before 
the storm.

Then, out of the darkness came 

Florence + the Machine.

Florence herself arrived bare-

foot, dressed in a sheer gown 
like a heroine from a gothic 
novel. Her fiery red hair swung 
unbound behind her. The night 
was dark, but not fearful; there 
is never room for fear in the pres-
ence of Florence. As the beat 
dropped, she raised her arms up 
to the sky as if in offering, and 
then, there was light — literally, 
it wasn’t until 30 seconds into the 
first song that any lights turned 
on at all. 

The entire experience was 

otherworldly. Florence + the 
Machine always have a dreamlike 
style, with songs that are lyri-
cally beautiful and complex. But 
to see Florence perform in person 
is something else entirely. She 
seemed almost ethereal; a wild, 
beautiful creature, running and 
dancing across the 
stage. Her move-
ments sharp, then 
suddenly soft and 
flowing. 
With 

every song, every 
note, every word, 
Florence 
chan-

neled the energy 
through 
her, 
as 

if her body was a 
mere conduit for 
some greater power. Take the 
music away, and Florence could 
have been a body possessed in a 
horror movie — not horrifying, 
but as if there was something else 
present on stage with her. 

Her 
music, 
powerful 
and 

strong-willed, seemed a comple-
ment, rather than a contradic-
tion, to Florence’s sweet, gentle 
personality. As she spoke for the 
first time to the audience, Flor-
ence gently admitted her own 
anxiety about speaking to such a 
large crowd. In response, jubilant 
cheers and cries of love erupted 
almost violently from the audi-
ence. It was like a harsh, demand-
ing tug on your soul: No, Florence, 
do not apologize or be afraid! It 

seemed divinely unjust for a per-
son so beautiful (both inside and 
out) to be humbled by the masses 
that often weep and whisper her 
name like a prayer in their dark-
est moments. 

And really, it was as if Flor-

ence was a goddess. Every word 
she spoke, the audience strained 
to hear, catch and hold within 
their hearts; every request was 
treated like a commandment. 
Florence asked us to turn to one 
another and embrace each other 
— so we did. She asked us to give 
words of love and positivity to 
each other — a girl yelled in my 
ear that she liked my scarf, and I 
hugged her and waxed poetic on 
her earrings. Florence asked us to 
put away our cell phones — every 
screen switchedblinked off. 

The magnificence of Florence 

+ the Machine was a combination 
of evocative music and a power-
ful stage presence. Audiences 
react and take their cues from 
the artists on stage; an engaging 
artist makes for an engaging per-
formance. Florence, more so than 
Musgraves or The 1975, gave her-
self utterly and completely to the 
moment, to the music. Her scant 
dress and bare feet heightened 
the connection between musi-
cian and audience member. It 
was as if Florence rooted herself 
to the stage, to the very ground. 
It was watching Florence on the 
jumbo screen kiss the forehead of 

a young man at the 
front of the crowd; 
desperately 
clasp 

hands 
with 
the 

arms that reached 
out to touch her; 
sing 
among 
the 

audience with a 
flower-crown a fan 
gave her that made 
Florence 
seem 

both larger-than-

life, but also closer and more inti-
mate than any artist before. 

Florence told the audience 

that she wanted everyone there 
to share and indulge in an expe-
rience. She wanted to create 
something that would stay with 
us — with her — and mark the 
moment. Together, we did. No 
one who cheered for an encore 
at near-midnight will ever for-
get the evening of Saturday, June 
1, 2019, spent sweaty, tired and 
cramped on Randall’s Island, 
awaiting that moment we would 
never forget. The moment we 
would tell our friends, our family 
and maybe one day our children, 
and grandchildren, and nurses at 
the senior living facility.

Then, out of the 
darkness came 
Florence + the 

Machine.


Democratic 
presidential 
candidates Jay Inslee and Elizabeth 
Warren both visited Detroit on 
Tuesday. Inslee has been governor 
of the state of Washington since 
2013 and has focused his campaign 
on environmental issues. Warren, a 
Massachusetts senator, has created 
a progressive campaign focused on 
rebuilding the middle class and 
fighting 
corruption. 
According 
to Real Clear Politics averages, 
Warren and Inslee currently poll 
at 8.3 and 0.5 percent, respectively.
On Tuesday morning, Jay Inslee 
spoke with three environmental 
justice leaders in the 48217 zip 
code of Detroit, which has been 
referred to as “most polluted zip 
code in Michigan.” The event was 
composed of a walking tour around 
the Kemeny Recreation Center 
and the neighboring Marathon 
Petroleum refinery.
Inslee’s campaign has been 
focused on combating climate 
change and he highlighted the 
progress Washington has made 
under his leadership in combating 
climate change. When asked about 
why he was visiting Detroit, Inslee 
emphasized 
the 
environmental 
impact of the fossil fuel industry on 
the communities they operate in.
“I’m in Detroit to see the 
problems that the fossil fuel 
industry, specifically the oil and 
gas industry, causes the residents 
of this area,” Inslee said. “I have 
proposed a plan to wean us off of 

fossil fuels so that these families 
don’t have to breathe these fumes 
and their children don’t have to 
be exposed to asthma and cancer, 
which appears to be a higher rate 
here.”
Theresa Landrum, a Detroit 
resident who has been working 
since the 1980s to clean up 
pollution, lead most of the walk. 
She said she has lived in the area 
her whole life and remembers what 
the community center looked like 
before the refinery moved in.
“Marathon and I-75 have taken 
up wetlands; we had possum, the 
fox, the raccoons, the gardener 
snake, the turtles. We used to 
play there as children,” Landrum 
said. “Every home had a garden, 
every home had five to six fruit 
trees. They have all died out, and I 
contribute that to the emissions in 
the air. If the vegetation dies out, 
what is that doing to human life?”
Landrum 
talked 
about 
the 
impact the Marathon plant has had 
on the surrounding community, 
which she said has been widely 
felt.
“We need doctors to be to be 
trained to be able to identify more 
environmentally-related diseases,” 
Landrum said. “We know that 
we are a vulnerable community. 
We should not be compared to a 
healthy community when it comes 
to national standards. You have to 
compare a vulnerable community 
with a vulnerable community.”

Pride month feature: “Not my binary”

When I was five years old, I found myself 
on a muddy, cold football field. I was in kin-
dergarten playing flag football in Saginaw, 
Michigan. I was the only girl. That day, I 
didn’t think about being the only girl on the 
field, I only remembered being forced onto 
my back by an illegal tackle and scoring a 
touchdown the following play. My anger 
seemed to propel me to the end zone, my 
father screaming for joy when I crossed the 
threshold unscaved.
From five years old, I’ve loved the rug-
gedness of contact sports and the masculin-
ity associated with such sporting events. I’ve 
found solace in the volatility of a basketball 
game, the ebb and flow of organized sports. 
I fell in love with the way my father com-
municated with me through the analysis of a 
turnover or a missed shot. Sports was my lan-
guage, my love. But, as I became older, I real-
ized that my masculinity was only supposed 
to be regulated within the lines of a basketball 
court or flag football field.

Growing up, I always felt more like one 
of the “boys” than the “girls.” Back then, I 
thought my masculinity was weird and wrong. 
It was often times critiqued by the extremely 
heterosexual, feminine Christian women 
that I grew up around. I was not girl enough. 
To them, my body language screamed mas-
culine, while my body screamed feminine. To 
them, my actions screamed man, while my 
words screamed woman. 
At that age, I didn’t 
understand the magni-
tude of the restrictions 
being placed on me, of 
the incorrectness asso-
ciated with those state-
ments, and how they 
would affect me in the 
future. It took me sixteen 
years to perform the mental gymnastics to 
evade the language spewed to misinform my 
true identity, and it may take me many more 
to stick the landing.
At twenty-one years old, I can say with 
complete assurance FUCK THE BINARY! 
The binary system that we’ve created within 
our society is trash. In this regard, it focuses 

on gender, but we’ve done ourselves a great 
disservice in every aspect of binaristic life. 
We live in a world where there are usually 
two choices: right or wrong, good or bad, 
straight or gay, man or woman. We restrict 
our mobility so much that our muscles begin 
to atrophy into binaristic semblances of once 
healthy tissue. Life cannot be a binary wheth-
er you’re talking about gender or anything 
else. The shades of grey 
that we live within are so 
vivid, yet society hates to 
admit that they exist.
My biological female 
frame does not inform 
how I must live my life; 
I don’t have to reside 
within the confines of 
a socially constructed 
binary to fit the aesthetic of “woman.” I am 
womxn because I feel innately womxn. I 
am womxn with the coarse hair that grows 
throughout my body, with the wide hips that 
extend back to generations of Black bodies. I 
am womxn with my snapback and my baggy 
shorts. I am womxn with my tight black shirt 
and my close-fitting denim. I am womxn with 

oversized hoodies and loose-fitting denim. I 
am womxn with a constant sweater-to-boot-
to-tennis shoe ratio.
I am womxn without a fresh face of the lat-
est foundation. I am womxn without groom-
ing my eyebrows or shaving my armpit hair. 
I am womxn with my stud earrings. I am 
womxn with my thick 4c hair. I am womxn 
with braids extending from the front of my 
head to the very back. I am womxn with mini 
twists that morph into gorgeous locs. I am 
womxn without manipulating my tight curls 
after I arise from my slumber. I am womxn 
with a freshly shaven bald head. I am womxn 
with my arms wrapped around another 
womxn, she/them lying on my chest in the 
warmest embrace, our heartbeats producing 
a melodic symphony of revolutionary love 
and anti-binaristic, holistically-loving badas-
sery.
I AM WOMXN BECAUSE I SAY I AM.
And however my masculine and femi-
nine energies decide to reside in my biologi-
cally female frame, I’ll let them. Since I was 
five years old, my body restricted the binary 
because it was never made to live within it, 
but wherever it wanted to.

I AM WOMXN 
BECAUSE I SAY I 
AM.

Michigan hires Phil Martelli, Howard Eisley as assistants

John Beilein was the veteran 
coach 
who 
filled 
his 
bench 
with 
younger, 
up-and-coming 
assistants. For new coach Juwan 
Howard, it was the opposite for 
his first hire.
It had long been rumored that 
Howard, a young coach with 
no college or head coaching 
experience, was looking for a 
veteran head coach to join his 
staff, and Howard has now found 
that person in former St. Joseph’s 

coach Phil Martelli, according 
to a report from NBC Sports 
Philadelphia.
At 64, Martelli is old for an 
NCAA assistant. He spent the 
last 24 years coaching the Hawks 
in the Atlantic 10 conference, 
where he led them to seven NCAA 
Tournaments, including a Sweet 
Sixteen appearance in 1996 and 
an Elite Eight run in 2004. That 
year, St. Joseph’s went undefeated 
in the regular season and Martelli 
won the Naismith and Associated 
Press Coach of the Year awards.
However, the Hawks made the 

tournament just twice in the past 
11 years, with five losing seasons 
in that span. In March, in the 
wake of several disappointing 
seasons, Martelli was let go, and 
as a former mid-major coach 
whose best days were behind him, 
he did not receive much interest 
for open head jobs.
But Martelli fit perfectly the 
assistant role Howard was looking 
to fill. Martelli was beloved in 
Philadelphia, and six of his former 
players went on to play in the 
NBA — including three first-round 
draft picks. He has also been an 

assistant before, holding that 
position at St. Joseph’s from 1985-
1995.
Michigan also has decided to 
complete its assistant coaching 
staff with the hiring of Howard 
Eisley, according to The Athletic. 
Eisley comes from a very different 
background than Martelli but 
his pedigree is similar to that of 
Howard instead.
A former teammate of Jalen 
Rose, Eisley is a Detroit native, 
graduating from Southwestern 
High School before playing at 
Boston College. Playing 12 seasons 

in the NBA and retiring in 2006, 
he entered the coaching realm 
in 2010 as an assistant for the 
Los Angeles Clippers. He also 
spent time as an assistant for the 
Washington Wizards and New 
York Knicks.
With the hiring of Martelli and 
Eisley, Howard has no more spots 
left to fill in his coaching staff. 
Saddi Washington, an assistant 
under Beilein, is staying on staff, 
but Luke Yaklich left to become 
the associate head coach at Texas 
and DeAndre Haynes was not 
retained by Howard.

Win or go home.
That was the scenario for the 
Michigan baseball team Monday 
after missing out on a chance 
Sunday to advance to the Super 
Regional. After losing to Creighton 
11-7, they faced the Bluejays once 
again 
for 
another 
chance 
to 
advance.
In the top of the fifth inning 

with no outs and the bases loaded, 
redshirt 
freshman 
right-hander 
Isaiah Page stepped onto the 
mound. 
The 
Wolverines 
were 
clinging to a 6-4 lead, but Page 
cooly forced the first two batters 
he faced to pop out and struck out 
the final batter swinging to get out 
of the jam.
Michigan didn’t seemed phased 
by the sudden-death atmosphere, 
eventually winning 17-6.
Freshman left-hander Walker 

Cleveland was on the mound for the 
Wolverines. But he didn’t last long. 
Creighton drew first blood in the 
second inning. Leadoff hitter Will 
Robertson took the 0-2 pitch deep 
for a solo-shot down the right-field 
line. The Bluejays added another 
run in the top of the third off an 
RBI triple which ended Cleveland’s 
day. Sophomore right-hander Blake 
Beers replaced him and retired the 
side.
The Wolverines responded in 

the bottom of the third with the 
bases 
loaded. 
Senior 
infielder 
Blake Nelson earned a walk to 
score sophomore outfielder Jesse 
Franklin, cutting the deficit to 2-1.
Creighton’s 
leadoff 
hitters 
continued their hot batting in the 
fourth with another solo home run 
down the left-field line, this time 
by Jack Strunc. Beers continued to 
struggle giving up a double to the 
next batter and later an RBI single 
to make it 4-1 after the top of the 

fourth.
But for each punch that the 
Bluejays landed, Michigan had a 
counter.
Two consecutive walks to open 
the bottom of the fourth forced 
a pitching change for Creighton 
as John Sakowski replaced Evan 
Johnson. But that didn’t stop the 
Wolverines’ bats. Sakowski gave up 
back-to-back runs after a double by 
Franklin scored two and a single 
by junior outfielder Jordan Brewer 
allowed two more to cross the plate. 
Brewer also scored when Nelson 
grounded out to third base, giving 
Michigan a 6-4 lead.
In the bottom of the fifth 
inning, a solo home run came from 
sophomore catcher Joe Donovan 
who had hit only six all year prior 
to Monday to extend the Michigan 
lead to 7-4.
The Wolverines blew the game 
wide open in the sixth and seventh 
innings, scoring ten runs and 
allowing only one to take a 17-5 lead.
The most satisfying play of the 
game for Michigan came in the 
sixth inning when sophomore 
infielder Jack Blomgren laid down 
a suicide squeeze to perfection. 
The Creighton infield was unaware 
of the large leadoff the runners on 
second and third had, allowing 
both to score. The timely play call 
by Michigan coach Erik Bakich 
put the Wolverines firmly in the 
driver’s seat.
Junior 
right-hander 
Jack 
Weisenberger entered the game 
in the ninth inning and closed the 
game out for the Wolverines.
The win propelled Michigan 
to their first Super Regional in 12 
years. They will face the winner of 
Loyola Marymount and UCLA.

For Howard, recruiting 
will be biggest challenge

When Jimmy King came home 
from high school practice as a 
highly-touted recruit, he wasn’t 
just greeted by his mother but 
often another call from Juwan 
Howard.
With only one phone attached to 
a cord that stretched through the 
house, as King recalled, he would 
mouth to his mom the moment it 
rang.
“I’m not here, I’m not here,” 
King would tell her while she 
responded to How-
ard.
As 
the 
first 
signee of the Fab 
Five, Howard took 
it 
upon 
himself 
to recruit his fel-
low 
teammates. 
Relentless in his 
pursuits, Howard 
is well-known for 
not only courting 
King to Michigan 
but also Chris Webber, Jalen Rose 
and Ray Jackson.
“Think I recruited you, right?” 
Howard said on Thursday as he 
looked at King from the podium 
at Crisler Center. “Told Jimmy I’m 
coming, you better come with me.”
Twenty-eight years later, How-
ard was introduced as Michigan’s 
basketball coach, and his focus 
toward recruiting will be more 
than just a one-time ordeal. His 
biggest priority as a recruiter is to 
find players who uphold the Michi-
gan culture of brotherhood within 
the team, similar to what he expe-
rienced during his playing days in 
Ann Arbor.
At the same time, though, he 
will need to learn the rules of the 
NCAA before doing so — a stark 
contrast from his predecessor, 
John Beilein, who knew the rule-
book like the back of his hand.
“Brotherhood is big with me,” 
Howard said. “The relationship 
that we built over the years — that 
will never leave us. They are family 
and I know how supportive Jimmy, 
Chris, Jalen, Ray (have been), and 
do you want me to name the other 
teammates? But I know how sup-
portive they all will be in helping 
to continue this Michigan winning 
tradition on and off the floor.
“Recruiting is going to be the 

challenge because I have to first 
understand all the rules. I want 
to continue to make sure that 
this culture does not take a step 
back. I will learn and get into 
that rulebook of NCAA rules as 
far as what you are allowed to 
do and what you’re not allowed 
to do. That’s gonna be one of the 
biggest challenges, and to my 
understanding, there are a lot of 
rules out there.”
As a former five-star, McDon-
ald’s All-American recruit with 
AAU ties through his children, 
Howard is expected to expand 
the Wolverines’ recruiting pipe-
line to players 
Beilein might not 
have considered. 
He affirmed that 
on Thursday, but 
made it known 
that 
he 
also 
wants 
to 
find 
pieces that best 
fit the puzzle.
“I’m all eyes, 
I’m all ears to 
talent,” Howard 
said. “I haven’t just pinpointed 
exactly like, I’m going after the 
five-star, one-and-dones or I’m 
going to recruit three-star kids. 
As a staff, we will meet. We will 
figure out, what is the best solu-
tion moving forward to give us 
the best chance to win?”
Current players are also eager 
to see how Howard’s pedigree, 
both as a player and coach, will 
drive the direction of recruiting. 
But they are confident that he 
will continue to bring in recruits 
that fit right in with the current 
roster.
“If I was a recruit, that would 
definitely catch my eye,” said 
junior forward Isaiah Livers. 
“You’ve got a guy who was in 
the NBA, played in the Fab Five, 
coached in the NBA. He’s got a 
lot of experience under his belt. 
That’s definitely going to draw 
my attention to Michigan.
“As long as he brings in peo-
ple that wanna play defense, 
is gonna work hard and just 
gonna be a great guy off the 
court, I have no problem. We 
all have no problem. We all 
want the same kind of guy. We 
want a guy we can hang out 
with on the court, off the court 
and a guy who works hard. And 
they’ll fit right in.”

“We want a guy 
we can hang 
out with... who 
works hard.”

Howard’s emotion, zeal for ‘M’ on 
display at intro press conference

As Juwan Howard approached 
the podium for his introductory 
press conference at the Crisler 
Center, he looked around the 
arena and into the rafters, trying 
to gather himself.
With his head down and his 
back towards to the podium, he 
was overtaken by his emotions. 
When he finally turned again to 
face the crowd seated on the court, 
he leaned into the microphone.
“It’s tears of joy,” Howard said.
As he battled back tears on the 
same floor where he once donned 
maize and blue to battle his 
on-court opponents, Howard left 
no doubt as to whether his passion 
had waned for the program.
His tears eventually became 
a smile as he seemed to come 
to terms with the gravity of the 
moment. According to Howard, 
this accomplishment is second 
only to earning his Michigan 
degree.
“It just made us even more 
excited, man,” said junior forward 
Isaiah Livers. “You got your head 
coach up there crying walking 
up, before he even gets called up 
there. That just shows that he’s 
going to put a lot of work in. He’s 
really going to push for his players 
to be great. He’s going to make –– 
even off the court, he mentioned 
that earlier –– he just wants our 

players to be good people on and 
off the court. No matter what you 
do, he’s going to support us.”

guard 
Adrien Nuñez: “That’s cool as 
well that he cares enough to even 
have that emotion. There’s not 
a lot of guys that would even go 
up there and have that emotional 
attachment to this university. So 
he’s definitely going to put his best 
foot forward in bringing the best 
assistant coaches, having us be as 
prepared as possible, so I’m really 
excited.”
Howard had been here before 
–– 
participating 
in 
a 
press 
conference at the then-Crisler 
Arena –– but the circumstances 
were quite different. The last time 
he was in a press conference in 
that building, he was declaring for 
the 1994 NBA Draft.
That moment was bittersweet 
for Howard. A promising NBA 
career beckoned, but fresh off an 
Elite Eight loss to Arkansas in the 
NCAA Tournament, he couldn’t 
help but feel a sense of guilt.
“I didn’t do what I came here 
to do,” Howard said. “And that 
was to bring a championship to 
this university. A university that I 
cared so much about. ... Now let’s 
fast forward 25 years later. I’m 
back.”
Over two decades removed 
from his last attempt to bring a 
national championship to Ann 
Arbor, 
Howard 
gets 
another 
chance –– a chance he could not 

pass on.
Howard said Thursday that 
he could’ve stayed in the NBA. 
He received an offer to be the 
associate head coach for the 
Minnesota 
Timberwolves, 
but 
his mind was fixated on only one 
vacancy: Michigan’s.
Despite spending the week 
preparing for the Timberwolves 
interview, news of John Beilein 
leaving the Wolverines for the 
NBA allowed Howard’s mind to 
wander. Friends and family asked 
Howard if he would consider 
coaching in college.
“My answer has always been, 
there’s only one job, only one 
school I would look back and 
pursue at a collegiate level,” 
Howard said, “and that’s the 
University of Michigan.”
For Howard, becoming the 17th 
head coach in program history is a 
dream come true. His zeal for the 
Michigan basketball program was 
on full display from the time he 
walked onto the court Thursday. 
For the current players and 
former teammates in attendance, 
Howard’s fervor spoke volumes.
“No, 
I’m 
not 
(surprised) 
because Juwan is not afraid to 
show –– you know, he’s a strong 
man –– he’s always been a strong 
person to show his emotions,” 
King said. “... None of that was 
fake, that was all real. He’s happy 
to be back. He even got me to tear 
up a little. I gotta keep my rep, but 
he’s killing me right now.”

Warde Manuel spoke directly, 
with certainty and confidence.
“We looked at many,” Manuel 
said. 
“Broad 
scope. I stand 
here today with 
my choice.”
Before 
Juwan Howard 
had 
stepped 
to the podium 
as 
Michigan’s 
new basketball 
coach 
and 
before 
a 
question had been asked, Manuel 
answered the day’s biggest one. 
Since John Beilein left, a coaching 
search unfolded and ended last 
week with Howard, there has 
been a not-so subtle implication of 
nepotism that has come with the 
discussion of Howard.
Howard 
has 
the 
requisite 
qualifications, it starts, but would 
he be in this position if not for his 
association with the Fab Five? 
Manuel, who has never had a 
hiring of this magnitude in his 
hands completely, must be under 
pressure 
from 
donors. 
From 
regents. From Jalen Rose and 

Chris Webber; LeBron James and 
Dwyane Wade.
The 
athletic 
director 
acknowledged as much seconds 
later, noting Howard’s resonance 
with the university, its fans and its 
donors.
But, outside pressures being 
as they may, this decision was 
Manuel’s to make. His choice. His 
gamble.
“There’s a whole lot of bunch 
of adjectives like that, that have 
already been used, and that’s fine,” 
Manuel said. “If I’m gonna take a 
risk for somebody, they’ll see why 
I took the risk and the gamble — 
and all the things you all say about 
what could possibly happen — 
with Juwan Howard.”
To be clear, it is a gamble and it 
does run a risk of failure. So would 
any other. That is beside the point.
Beilein left the Wolverines 
with little warning in mid-May — 
when the coaching carousel had 
already slowed. The candidate 
pool, inherently, was thinner than 
it might have been a month or 
two earlier. And, even if Manuel 
had his pick of the lot, it would be 
impossible to hire another Beilein.

The best coach in the history of 
the program doesn’t come around 
often. Particularly not when that 
coach is Beilein, who ran things in 
a way unique throughout college 
basketball.
Howard hasn’t been in college 
basketball. He isn’t familiar with 
a world where a slip of the tongue 
can be a recruiting violation, and 
admitted as much 
on Thursday. Even 
without his ties to 
the Fab Five, the 
likelihood that he 
recruits programs 
like Mac Irvin Fire, 
the way his name 
alone makes heads 
turn — that makes 
him 
inherently 
antithetical 
to 
Beilein.
And that is fine.
Juwan Howard isn’t here to 
build on John Beilein’s legacy. He’s 
here to make his own. There are 
no shortage of basketball reasons 
to think he can.
Howard 
comes 
with 
endorsements 
from 
Pat 
Riley 
and Erik Spoelstra, two names 

that should carry more weight 
than his former teammates. He 
succeeded as an assistant in 
Miami, unequivocally so. The 
Heat won titles when they had the 
requisite talent, and outperformed 
expectation anyway when they 
didn’t. Howard was a repeated 
candidate for NBA job openings 
for a reason — he’s developed 
a 
well-earned 
reputation 
as 
a 
good 
basketball 
mind, and someone 
who connects with 
players.
There’s also the 
intangible — which 
was on full display 
Thursday 
when 
Howard 
stepped 
to the podium and 
wiped tears from 
his eyes, needing to gather himself 
before he started speaking.
Yes, it’s concerning that it may 
take some time for Howard to get 
a grasp on the NCAA’s rulebook. 
And yes, it should raise eyebrows 
that he answered a question about 
his basketball philosophy with, 
“Well, it remains to be seen, fellas, 

right?”
The rest of his answer, though, 
speaks to the qualities that got him 
hired.
“But I can tell you this,” Howard 
said. “One thing about me, I’m 
humble. And I don’t have all the 
answers. We’re gonna try to figure 
out solutions together. … Players 
have to be active participants in 
finding solutions. We will create 
this identity together. And we will 
have fun doing it, too.”
All that — the emotion and the 
attitude, the acknowledgements 
that he isn’t perfect and the 
willingness to work on it — makes 
it believable that Howard will put 
in the hours to fill the gaps. This 
is no reunion tour or nostalgia trip, 
nice as those side benefits may 
be. Howard was hired because 
Warde Manuel thinks he can 
win basketball games, first and 
foremost.
But don’t get it wrong. This 
is Manuel’s gamble. The right 
gamble.
