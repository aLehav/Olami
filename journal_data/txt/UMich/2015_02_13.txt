CELEBRATING OUR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Proposal to make two 
years of community 
college free could 
impact University

By ANASTASSIOS 
ADAMOPOULOS

Daily Staff Reporter

Last week, President Barack 

Obama outlined the specifics of his 
plan to provide two years of tuition-
free education to community col-
lege students — a program which 
could affect student enrollment at 
the University.

The plan, expected to cost the an 

estimated $60 billion over 10 years, 
will be funded by closing tax loop-
holes and increased taxation for 
high-earning tax brackets. The fed-
eral government will pay for three-
quarters of the program and the 
states will pay the rest.

Additionally, 
the 
proposal 

includes certain stipulations for eli-
gible students, including having a 
GPA of 2.5 or higher and be enrolled 
at least half time. Community col-
leges must also fulfill several con-

ditions. Their academic programs 
must be eligible for transfer to local 
four-year institutions or they must 
have high graduation rates in career 
and technical programs.

According to the White House, 

should the proposal be imple-
mented in all states, around 9 mil-
lion students would annually save 
approximately $3,800 each.

Higher education officials have 

identified two potential impacts of 
the plan: a boost in the number of 
community college students and 
fluctuations in the transfer rate 
between four-year institutions and 
community colleges.

Jason Morgan, director of gov-

ernment relations at Washtenaw 
Community College, said the plan 
could potentially increase the num-
ber of community college students, 
but noted that it is still just a pro-
posal.

“Our first impression is that the 

plan sounds extremely positive,” 
Morgan said. “As we learn more 
details we’ll hopefully learn how, 
exactly, it is going to impact com-
munity colleges.”

Along with increasing the num-

ber of community college students

Rackham student Jae Beom Bae speaks with student entrepreneurs at the ICE Winter Blast innovation event at the Michigan Union Thursday. 

Innovate Blue, 

CSG bring together 

students from 

different schools

By LINDSEY SCULLEN

Daily Staff Reporter

The ICE Winter Blast, an 

event for entrepreneurs, got a bit 
hot Wednesday.

Hosted by Innovate Blue, the 

University’s unifying body for 
innovation and entrepreneur-
ship, and the Central Student 
Government’s Commission on 
Student Innovation, the event 
brought together several hun-
dred innovators from multiple 
University schools, as well as the 
Ann Arbor community — before 
kicking them out briefly to the 
tune of a fire alarm and a faint 
smell of smoking popcorn.

Held 
Wednesday 
evening 

in the Michigan Union’s Rogel 
Ballroom, the blast was halted 
briefly but resumed after a quick, 
impromptu tour of the Union’s 
front steps and the event’s ice 
sculpture being carved on the 
front lawn.

Kristen Kerecman, Innovate 

Blue communications manager, 
said the purpose of the event was 
to showcase campus-wide inno-
vation and to bring more students 
into the University’s entrepre-
neurial “ecosystem.”

“This is the way to show stu-

dents what’s happening, like 
some of the ventures that stu-
dents are working on, and the 
resources to help them get there,” 
she said.

But pulling in new students 

was not the event’s only purpose.

“The Commission was cre-

ated to connect and unify all of 
the 
various 
entrepreneurship 

entities on campus and to have 
this big celebration of what we

Founder says he 
will personally 
speak at CSG 

meeting next week

By TANAZ AHMED

Daily Staff Reporter

The organizers behind a pro-

posed Michigan spirit song have 
pulled a funding resolution pro-
posed during Tuesday’s Central 
Student Government meeting.

First introduced during the 

meeting 
Tuesday, 
“Hail 
and 

Unite” sparked debate over the 
future of the University’s fight 
song, “The Victors.”

However, LSA senior Mike 

Weinberg, one of the project’s 
main founders, said the song 
would be a pump-up song and is 
not intended to replace the long-
standing fight song.

“During third down, instead 

of having that generic pop song 
that every other school has, we’re 
going to have our own song that 
we created, that we were a part 
of,” he said in an interview with 
The Michigan Daily on Wednes-
day evening.

Project organizers officially 

launched the initiative’s website 
Thursday morning.

Tuesday’s initial announce-

ment generated criticism from 
alums and students, who saw the 
project as an attempt to replace 
“The Victors.” Weinberg said 
the project was not explained 
thoroughly at the CSG meeting. 
Because the project was mis-

understood, Weinberg said the 
resolution has been pulled and he 
plans to personally present on the 
project at CSG’s meeting on Feb. 
17. He also said the resolution will 
also likely be reintroduced.

The 
organization 
initially 

asked CSG to appropriate $2,750 
from its Legislative Discretionary 
Fund. The funds would support 
a promotional video campaign to 
raise additional donations for the 
project as well as provide accom-
modations to visiting contribu-
tors to the project.

Several CSG representatives 

asked for a more detailed project 
budget and the proposal was later 
sent to the finance committee for 
review.

Weinberg stressed the impor-

tance of student, alumni and fan 
involvement in creating the song.

The group working on “Hail 

and Unite” is composed of 22 
students from several University 
schools and colleges, including 
LSA, Art and Design, Business 
and Music, Theatre and Dance.

Weinberg expressed interest in 

partnering with MUSIC Matters, 
the University group that orga-
nizes an annual benefit concert, 
as well as the marching band and 
local organizations based in Ann 
Arbor.

“Everyone is coming together 

to create this amazing project 
that is going to revolutionize what 
it means to have music, sports and 
entertainment,” Weinberg said.

Author Jonah Goldberg speaks about his book on “Liberal Fascism” at Rackham Amphitheater Thursday. 

Jonah Goldberg 

considers ties 

between liberalism, 

fascism

By WILL GREENBERG

Daily News Editor

It was with attention-grab-

bing language and crowd-pleas-
ing wit that Jonah Goldberg 
discussed his views on Ameri-
can history and politics — offer-
ing a perspective rarely seen at 
the University.

Goldberg, author of the 2008 

bestseller 
“Liberal 
Fascism” 

and 2013’s “The Tyranny of 
Clichés,” talked misinterpreta-
tions of world history, debunk-
ing liberal heroism and political 
correctness in the Rackham 
Amphitheatre 
on 
Thursday. 

Goldberg is also a frequent col-
umnist for National Review 
Online, and it appeared he had 

many in fans in the crowd.

During the lecture, he dis-

cussed the arguments of his 
books — that fascist movements, 
contrary to popular belief, are 
left wing at their core, and how 
liberals profess to be pragmatic 
problem solvers when they, in 
fact, have an ideological agenda.

Goldberg walked through 

his argument of liberal fas-
cism by elaborating on the Nazi 
party in Germany. He asked: 
“Except for the murder, big-
otry, genocide and war, what 
is it, exactly, about Nazism you 
don’t like?” He argued that the 
Nazi’s support of nationalism, 
condemnation of consumerism 
and denouncement of religion 
exemplified how “fascism” and 
“communism” were not oppo-
sites.

Additionally, going deeper 

into “The Tyranny of Cliches,” 
he discussed how clichés tend 
to “do our thinking for us,” and 
cited a favorite of his: “Violence 

never solves anything.”

“Violence 
is 
very 
useful 

is some specific situations — 
they’re called violent situa-
tions,” he said, adding how he 
feels the phrase is too often 
addressed at the respondent to 
violence and not the original 
aggressor.

Goldberg 
also 
addressed 

political dialog and political 
correctness more generally. In 
an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily before his speech, he 
said he took issue with the idea 
that liberal students see them-
selves as “sticking it to the man” 
when they are surrounded by 
mostly liberal professors and 
peers.

He said it’s problematic how 

students assume college is a 
time to join protests and social 
movements when they have 
no knowledge of the conflict 
they’re involved in.

28 students and six 
professors receive 
grants for global 
research projects

By NABEEL CHOLLAMPAT

Daily Staff Reporter

The University will continue 

to boast the highest number of 
Fulbright recipients of any pub-
lic institution in the country.

For the 2014-2015 academic 

year, 28 University students 
received Fulbright grants. Six 
faculty members were also 
awarded grants through the 
program.

The Fulbright U.S. Student 

Program 
distributes 
fellow-

ships for students to pursue 
studies, research, training or 
teaching abroad.

The U.S. State Department 

announced the list Thursday 
morning, with only Harvard 
University, which earned 33 
grants, receiving more than the 
University.

Last year, 33 University stu-

dents were named scholars.

In a release, University Pres-

ident Mark Schlissel said the 
28 scholars represent the Uni-
versity’s commitment to global 
affairs.

“U-M is thrilled that our 

young scholars are once again 
so 
well-represented 
in 
the 

Fulbright Program,” Schlissel 
said. “These 28 students are a 
testament to our strong aca-

‘U’ students launch series of 
events to answer 36 questions 

DELANEY RYAN/Daily

Participants spent 45 minutes in the Michigan League Wednesday evening asking each other a series of 36 personal 
questions to see what kind of bond they could form. 

Agenda includes 
health care plan 
renewals, possible 
dam gate contract

By ANASTASSIOS 
ADAMOPOULOS
Daily Staff Reporter

The Ann Arbor City Council 

is set to discuss a number of top-
ics during Tuesday’s meeting. 
The body will address a number 
of potential street closings, the 
renewal of its health care pro-
vider contract, the signing of a 
new contract to replace a dam 
floodgate at the Geddes Dam and 
the relocation of sewage system 
resources to affordable housing.

Street closings

The council will discuss the 

approval of more than seven dif-

ferent street closings to accom-
modate a variety of events.

The resolutions include three 

street closings in April for the 
Take Back the Night rally and 
march on April 2, the Fool Moon 
Festival on April 10 and the Fes-
tiFools Parade on April 12.

Two street closings in May 

will also be considered. If 
passed, they will accommodate 
the Burns Park Run on May 3 
and Ann Arbor Goddess 5K for 
the Michigan Ovarian Cancer 
Alliance on May 10.

East Washington Street and 

West Washington Street will 
also be closed, pending approval, 
for the annual Oktoberfest cele-
bration Sept. 11 through Sept. 13.

Blue Cross Blue Shield

Up for discussion is the 

approval of a contract renewal 
with Blue Cross Blue Shield, a 
Michigan-based health care pro-
vider.

Blue Cross Blue Shield pro-

vides health care coverage to 
city employees and retirees. 
Monthly costs of the plan are 
subject to changes in the num-
ber of employees and retirees as 
well as the number of submitted 
claims.

The estimated annual insur-

ance cost is $12,889,507.

Geddes Dam

The agenda also includes the 

proposal of awarding a contract 
to replace a tainter gate at Ged-
des Dam, which crosses the 
Huron River in southeast Ann 
Arbor.

According to the proposal, 

Gerace 
Construction 
Com-

pany was one of three compa-
nies considered for the project. 
They offered the lowest bid of 
$299,990.

The total cost of the projects 

amounts to $395,000, which 
provides for city staff inspection 
services and fees to hire a con-
sulting firm.

The contract proposal comes 

after the tainter gate suffered 
damage in January. The gate 
was damaged after the extreme 
cold caused the control respon-
sible for operating the gate to 
malfunction. Officials decided 
to replace, rather than repair the 
gate.

Sewage Funding allocations
Council will also discuss allo-

cating additional resources to 
affordable housing initiatives.

Specifically, it will hear a 

resolution to decommit fund-
ing from the Sewage Disposal 
System Fund Balance of the 
Near North Apartments and use 
this money to set up a budget 
for sanitary sewer expenses of 
the North Maple Estates, a low-
income family housing develop-
ment maintained by the Arbor 
Housing Commission. The funds 
total $153,611.

The North Maple Estates will 

have 42 new affordable rental 
apartments and four more that 
will be renovated.

New York Times 
column inspires 
new way to meet 
people, fall in love

By TANYA MADHANI

Daily Staff Reporter

Wednesday night, while more 

than 70 people asked complete 
strangers 
personal 
questions 

hoping to fall in love or make a 
new friend, two University stu-
dents sat together in a corner of 
the room, furiously coding a new 
website to set their movement in 
motion.

Inspired by a column in The 

New York Times, these two 
students are hoping to launch a 
nationwide movement to help 
students form relationships.

On Jan. 9, writer Mandy Len 

Catron posted a narrative called 
“To Fall in Love With Anyone, 
Do This,” for Modern Love, a 
rotating column in The New 
York Times. In the column, she 
describes how she fell in love 
with her current partner by 
mimicking a study conducted by 
psychologist Arthur Aron, who 

teaches at Stony Brook Univer-
sity.

In the study, Aron describes 

gathering two strangers in a lab 
setting to ask them 36 questions 
designed to accelerate intimacy. 
He reported he had successfully 
managed to make his subjects 
fall in love, and they married 
six months after the experiment 
was conducted.

Engineering 
junior 
Randa 

Sakallah and Engineering senior 
Natasja Nielsen hosted a “36 
Questions” session at the Michi-
gan League on Wednesday night 
with more than 70 participants.

After reading Catron’s Mod-

ern Love column, Sakallah’s first 
thought was to host an event at 
the University similar to Aron 
and Catron’s experiments.

“Going into this semester I 

had just kind of been thinking 
about what kinds of social events 
I can do with my friends that 
are different from just a normal 
party,” she said.

After posting an event on 

Facebook, they said it had com-
pletely sold out within three 
hours and more than 100 people 
had joined the waitlist.

“It happened really organi-

cally,” Nielsen said. “We just 

started inviting all of our friends 
and they started RSVP-ing and 
inviting their friends.”

Participants 
were 
sent 
a 

three-part survey three days 
before the event. The first part 
asked for the participant’s name, 
gender, sexual orientation and 
age, and the second was a series 
of questions asking them to rank 
their interest in topics concern-
ing organization, religion and 
theoretical physics. Nielsen and 
Sakallah said they enjoyed read-
ing the third segment of the 
questionnaire most, which asked 
what the participants were look-
ing to get out of the event.

“We were worried that some 

people would be going in with 
an expectation like ‘I’m going to 
find a date for Valentine’s Day,’ ” 
Sakallah said. “But most people 
had similar responses of ‘I’m 
coming in with an open mind. I 
don’t have any expectations.’ It’s 
really cool to see that perspec-
tive from students because … it’s 
kind of a vulnerable position to 
put yourself in.”

The depth of the event’s ques-

tions varied. Some were more 
benign such as how famous 
someone would like to be, and

overall, many students currently 
choose to finish their degree at a 
four-year institution after spend-
ing several years at a community 
college, meaning the proposed 
reform could have implications 
for four-year institutions like 
the University.

Michael 
Boulus, 
execu-

tive director of the President’s 
Council, State Universities of 
Michigan, said the plan could 
encourage potential students 
to enroll in community colleges 
rather than immediately enroll 
in four-year institutions.

“I would assume it would,” he 

said. “Just the simple dynamics 
of having a guaranteed free first 
two years of educations, assum-
ing that the 60 credits would 
transfer.”

Education Prof. Peter Bahr 

noted that though there could 
be a trend of students choosing 
community colleges, the effect 
probably wouldn’t be signifi-
cant for four-year institutions 
given the great imbalance in 
tuition costs that already exists 
between the two options, which 

determines college choice for 
many students.

“I think we will see some-

what more students in the com-
munity colleges for the first two 
years, but I don’t think it will be 
an enormously greater number 
of students because community 
colleges are already substan-
tially less expensive than pub-
lic four-year institutions,” Bahr 
said.

Boulus said he thought the 

number of transfer students 
from community colleges to 
four-year 
institutions 
would 

likely to increase. However, he 
noted that he would like to see 
the plan go even further than 
two years of free community 
college.

“Frankly, it ought to be a free 

two years regardless of what 
post-secondary institution you 
attend, whether it be the two 
year or the four year,” he said.

Bahr agreed the implemen-

tation of the proposal could 
potentially increase the number 
of transfer students.

He said the proposal pro-

vided a good incentive for insti-
tutions to work on changing 
their student transfer policies 
and establish clear agreements 

between four-year institutions 
and community colleges.

“There is the aspect of which 

of the credits will even count as 
credits at the four-year institu-
tions,” he said. “But then there 
is the more complex challenge 
of which course at the commu-
nity college has a parallel at the 
four-year institution.”

Morgan also acknowledged 

that transfer policies needed to 
be easier for students to under-
stand, though he pointed out the 
Michigan Transfer Agreement, 
which ensures that universities 
accept certain number of cred-
its from community colleges.

He noted that many students 

who come to WCC already 
know they want to go to the 
University, which has a spe-
cialized transfer process for 
WCC students, and therefore 
the school can advise them on 
which courses to take so credits 
can transfer.

“However the challenge, that 

there isn’t a solution for at this 
point, is that not every student 
comes into the community col-
lege knowing instantly that they 
want to transfer to a university 
afterwards,” Morgan said.

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald said it was too soon 
to speculate the effect the 
proposal would have on the 
University. He noted that the 
University has programs that 
work with community colleges 
to facilitate transferring.

Whether or not the White 

House’s plan will pass a GOP-
controlled House and Senate is 
also unclear.

Boulus said under the current 

circumstances, there does not 
appear to be Congressional sup-
port and the proposal probably 
won’t be taken up for vote.

However, 
Morgan, 
who 

met with various members of 
Congress and members of the 
Department of Education this 
week, said he came away with 
the impression that the goal 
wasn’t simply to get the propos-
al passed.

“The reason … is to start a 

national dialogue and a conver-
sation about how do we support 
community colleges and get 
students in the door of higher 
education,” he said. “The goal 
is not just to pass this. The goal 
is to throw out there something 
really big and see if we can get 
something small.

his organization, but no official 
collaboration has been proposed. 
He also noted that more informa-
tion is needed before determining 
whether or not MUSIC Matters 
would play a role.

“Hail and Unite” also has a 

philanthropic component.

“One of the things that we want 

to do is when we’re raising this 
money is that we want to give a 
significant philanthropic contri-
bution,” he said.

Though musicians such as Emi-

nem and David Banner, a rapper 
and music producer, were men-
tioned at the CSG meeting, Wein-
berg said those are two names out 
of a list of 15 to 20 potential celeb-
rities participants. Organizers 
also hope to create a music video 
and a documentary showcasing 

the process of creating the song.

“We’re trying to combine stu-

dents with outside talent to cre-
ate something that’s bigger than 
a song,” Weinberg said. “It’s cre-
ating a movement and something 
that’s from the ground organi-
cally, something that’s never been 
done in music, college or sports 
ever.”

Cooper Charlton, president of 

the University’s Student Athlete 
Advisory Committee, said that 
though he can’t speak for student 
athletes as a whole, he sees the 
University as a place where new 
ideas should be welcomed and 
discussed.

“I personally support innova-

tion and creativity but I would 
need to hear more about this 
initiative before I gave a firm 
answer,” he said.

demic programs and commit-
ment to global engagement that 
nurtures a passion for creating 
positive impacts across interna-

At the University, students 

complete a multi-step process 
to apply for a Fulbright grant, 
guided by the International 
Institute. Perspective recipients 
meet with a faculty and staff 
fellowship team several times 
to discuss their application and 
prepare for further steps, such 
as an interview.

Pauline Jones Luong, director 

of the International Institute, 
said there are several benefits 
both for the students and for the 
campus in devoting staff and 
faculty time toward preparing 
Fulbright applicants.

“It’s 
incredibly 
valuable 

because it showcases both the 
quality of the students at the U 
of M, the international orienta-
tion of those students, the global 
interests those students have, as 
well as the commitment of the 
University to ensuring that its 
students have an international 
experience, international edu-
cation,” she said. “It’s a win-win 
both for students and the Uni-
versity.”

University 
alum 
Nathan 

VanderVeen, one of the Ful-
bright recipients, is currently 
stationed in Seropédica, Brazil. 
He is pursuing an English teach-
ing assistantship at the Fed-
eral Rural University, as well as 

using his science background 
to work on a water purifica-
tion project in the Brazilian 
favelas.

“The Fulbright Program in 

general does favor the humani-
ties and people who are inter-
ested 
in 
intense 
literary 

research,” VanderVeen said in 
a Skype interview Thursday 
from Brazil. “But we’d be kid-
ding ourselves if we thought the 
ambassadors of the world were 
all English majors or foreign 
language majors. Those people 
who are constantly liaising with 
other countries are also the sci-
entists, physicians, engineers of 
the world.”

VanderVeen first applied as a 

junior during his undergradu-
ate studies and was rejected, but 
then reapplied for a 2015 grant.

He said the University’s sta-

tus as a public school makes 
it unique in its amount of Ful-
bright grantees.

“Being a public institution, 

I think that’s just so admirable 
because it puts such an empha-
sis on embracing students from 
all walks of life and still helping 
them reach the highest level of 
academic and professional suc-
cess,” VanderVeen said.

He added that as a part of his 

experience, he hopes to draw on 
the diversity of people he will be 
exposed to abroad.

“For me, it’s really important 

to connect with a diverse array 
of people from different back-
grounds, people with differ-
ent belief systems, so that I can 
become the best teacher that I 
can possibly be.”

siveness and productive dialogue, 
Goldberg said while people gener-
ally support social change, they are 
not given the chance to be includ-
ed or else are condemned for not 
joining fully. He said liberals use 
“moral bullying” on conservatives 
to attack them politically rather 
than create discussion.

“The same people who say we 

need an honest dialogue on race, 
we need to have an open and frank 
conversation on race — the second 
anybody takes that bait and says 
something even remotely ‘un-PC’ 
or offensive in any way — or not 
even offensive but that can be used 
to pretend that they were offended 
— they get beaten over the head 
with it,” he told the Daily.

“In a culture, the majority 

owes tolerance and respect to the 
minority, but the minority owes 
tolerance and respect to the major-
ity, too,” he said. “What is not 
constructive is when the minor-
ity responds by simply shouting, 
by this sort of moral bullying and 
guilt tripping that says ‘you are a 
bigot’ for absolutely well-inten-

tioned language that was accept-
able five minutes ago.”

LSA freshman Grant Strobl, 

chairman and founder of the Uni-
versity’s chapter of Young Ameri-
cans for Freedom, said he was 
happy to have Goldberg on cam-
pus to bring different ideas to the 
forefront on campus.

Strobl mentioned Communica-

tions Prof. Susan Douglas’ Decem-
ber article in which she states, “I 
hate Republicans,” and describes 
conservatives as against change 
and social tolerance. The column 
resulted in backlash from Repub-
licans across the state. Strobl said 
Douglas’ piece was an example of 
the one-sided nature among Uni-
versity faculty and students.

“It kind of coerces people into 

a certain ideology and that’s kind 
of where ‘liberal thought police’ 
comes from,” he said. “It’s decid-
ing what gets heard rather than 
allowing for a fair discussion 
between viewpoints.”

Strobl also cited the Inclusive 

Language Campaign as an exam-
ple of how the University professes 
to promote positive discussion, but 
excludes conservative students. 
Having gone through the pro-
gram himself, Strobl said the ILC 

doesn’t highlight terms attacking 
conservatives — like “right-wing-
er” or “tea-bagger” — but it should.

While he said he agrees with 

the end goal of promoting diversity 
and inclusion, he said he took issue 
with the idea of the program try-
ing to manage the words students 
used, saying there are unintended 
consequences to that approach.

“I feel like we should be embrac-

ing the diversity rather than trying 
to be too politically correct about it 
because I think that almost makes 
us more divisive,” he said. “I think 
it all comes through education and 
I think we’re all adults here and 
I think we can all approach each 
other in an adult-like manner and 
discuss the real issues.”

ILC is part of the University’s 

larger “Expect Respect” cam-
paign. Amanda McLittle, asso-
ciate director of diversity and 
inclusion in University Housing, 
wrote in an e-mail interview with 
the Daily that ILC is not a political 
organization and does not focus on 
“conservative” or “liberal” terms.

“Students chose the words that 

we are highlighting in this first 
year of ILC,” she wrote. “Multiple 
student focus groups were asked 
which words they would like to 

see included this year. The list of 
words is not meant be exhaustive.”

The ILC drew national atten-

tion this week after “The College 
Fix” reported the campaign cost 
$16,000 to implement, confirmed 
by University spokesperson Rick 
Fitzgerald. He said it’s difficult to 
put the cost of the program into 
perspective with other programs, 
but that the money went to bro-
chures and other awareness mea-
sures, not staff.

LSA senior Derek Draplin, the 

editor in chief of the student pub-
lication The Michigan Review, 
has been vocal about the ILC and 
attended the speech Thursday 
night. He said speakers like Gold-
berg are important to creating 
opening people’s minds on campus.

“The frontlines of culture-wars, 

so to speak, is on college campus-
es,” Draplin said. “There is a lock-
step belief in opinions on campus 
so that’s kind of why I came (to 
the Goldberg lecture) to challenge 
those establishment-type beliefs 
and comments and movements.”

Strobl said YAF plans to bring 

more speakers by the end of the 
semester, though the schedule is 
not yet set.

do,” said Engineering junior Diego 
Calvo, chair of the Commission on 
Student Innovation.

He added that the Commis-

sion’s goal is to combine all of 
the University’s entrepreneurial 
groups into “one powerhouse.”

“We think that every student at 

the University of Michigan should 
have the opportunity to find a 
team of crazy people and work on 
some project that really gets them 
going — more than just in classes,” 
Calvo said. “We want to see engi-
neers and LSA students and art 
and designers coming together 
and coming up with these amaz-
ing projects.”

Representative of that mission, 

the ICE Winter Blast was packed 
with students from many of the 
University’s different academic 
units, including the School of Pub-
lic Health’s Innovation and Social 
Entrepreneurship program, the 
School of Information and the 
School of Nursing. Various student 
organizations and ventures were 
also represented.

“To make the best ideas and 

solutions come out of U of M, 
and to give students the best pos-
sible experience, you have to meet 
people who aren’t like you and 
you have to work with different 
people,” Calvo said. “And so the 
commission has brought all these 

groups together.”

Calvo said the ICE Winter Blast 

served as a sort of finale event for 
the University’s Month of Entre-
preneurship, which ran from Jan. 
15 to Feb. 15 and included events 
like Startup Weekend, MHacks 
and Makeathon.

He said this event, in particular, 

was organized with the hope that 
students would come and see that 
entrepreneurship was relevant to 
them, even if they thought their 
field of interest didn’t include an 
emphasis on innovation.

LSA freshman Evan Garfinkel 

also led the event as part of the 
Commission on Student Innova-
tion.

“Mainly, the Commission on 

Student Innovation wanted to 
promote and expose innovation, 
creativity and entrepreneurship,” 
Garfinkel said.

For that reason, they named the 

event “ICE.”

“We sat down as a commission 

of the student government and we 
said it’s really important to expose 
more students to these ideas and 
for the students that want to par-
ticipate in this type of stuff to be 
able to connect them with orga-
nizations and with startups that 
would really be meaningful to 
them,” Garfinkel said. “There’s 
just a growing entrepreneurial 
presence and interest on campus 
where a lot of students from a lot 
of different schools across campus 
— whether it be Ross, whether it be 

Engineering or LSA.”

Art and Design senior Nick 

Tilma ran the School of Art and 
Design’s booth at the event. On 
display in front of his table was a 
prototype of what he called “Study 
Buddy,” a multi-surface, swivel-
ing desk he designed in a class last 
semester.

The class’s prompt was to 

design furniture and accessories 
for college students.

“We did the whole process of 

researching what people need, 
what people want and choosing 
and developing our projects into 
full-scale, working models,” Tilma 
said.

With him was Art and Design 

senior Xiaoying He. She, too, dis-
played a prototype of her prod-
uct, “Squishy,” a pillow holder for 
iPads, glasses and other odds and 
ends.

Stationed at the A2Geeks table, 

a nonprofit entrepreneurial hub 
in Ann Arbor, was Roger Rayle, a 
venture catalyst at R2VIVE. One 
of A2Geeks’s notable events is the 
monthly A2NewTech event, an 
idea-pitching session where entre-
preneurs can share ideas and net-
work.

“Half of the students here have 

already presented (at the event),” 
Rayle said.

In line with the event’s mission 

to connect entrepreneurs, sets of 
partnered organizations — one 
from the University and one from 
the students — have also created 

an events list on Innovation Blue’s 
website.

By way of this “central hub” 

they hope to keep students of all 
different backgrounds connected 
to entrepreneurial opportunities 
on campus and in Ann Arbor, Gar-
finkel said.

In addition to events like ICE, 

Jeni Olney, student affairs special-
ist at the Center for Entrepreneur-
ship, said the University wants to 
extend entrepreneurial opportu-
nities to all students by way of the 
Minor in Entrepreneurship.

Motioning to the student-filled 

Rogel Ballroom floor, Olney said 
students are already passionate 
about entrepreneurship.

“The minor offers that curricu-

lar stamp, saying that the Univer-
sity acknowledges and recognizes 
the efforts of these students at a 
curricular level,” Olney said. “We 
want to further equip them with 
the skills and the tools that will 
assist them in their endeavors out-
side of class.”

Calvo said he believes the drive 

to involve students from all over 
campus in entrepreneurship is 
unique to the University because 
of its interdisciplinary nature.

“We’re the only school that I 

know of where we’ve made entre-
preneurship integrated into the 
most general, largest college at 
our school, to show people that 
hey, no matter what you are study-
ing, there’s opportunities here for 
you,” Calvo said.

other were pointed inquiries 
about topics like familial rela-
tionships and death. At the 36 
Questions event hosted at the 
University, participants were split 
into groups and then, from the 
groups, further divided into pairs 
to answer the questions.

LSA junior Nivedita Karki, 

who is a web editor at the Michi-
gan Daily, and Engineering senior 
Madhav Achar, who both said 
they attended because its gen-
eral premise looked interesting, 
had met two years ago at a South 
Asian Awareness Network con-
ference before being coinciden-
tally paired together.

“It was just interesting to me 

that someone would think just 
knowing another person would 
be enough to fall in love with 
them,” Karki said. “It was kind of 
like being a part of a social experi-
ment.”

Achar said he didn’t mind 

answering some of the more per-
sonal questions included on the 
list.

“I had more fun answering 

them than if I was to go on a 
date in general,” he said. “The 
first time you meet someone you 
might ask a couple of questions, 
‘what’s your major? Blah, blah, 
blah.’ I’m glad to see that major 
wasn’t on here, because that’s 
not the most important thing 
about someone.”

After answering all 36 ques-

tions on the list, the next step 
for participants is to stare into 
each other’s eyes for four min-
utes without looking away or 
speaking. When it came time for 
participants at the University’s 
36 Questions to move on to this 
part of the event, the room was 
filled with sporadic giggles and 
whispers.

“I have trouble making eye 

contact with someone when I’m 
talking to them,” Achar said. 

“It’s just a habit. So just four 
minutes of eye contact without 
talking? That was kind of hard. 
But we had a good time, I think. 
We’re survivors.”

Achar and Karki said they 

were both planning to stay in 
touch and meet up again this 
weekend.

Sakallah, 
the 
co-organizer 

of the event, said it was impor-
tant for her to host 36 Questions 
in a University setting because 
oftentimes college students have 
a difficult time being open with 
others, even with people they’ve 
known for years.

“Especially at Michigan, peo-

ple aren’t apt to be super vulner-
able,” she said. “I was reading 
through these 36 questions and 
for some people I would think I 
know really well, I wouldn’t know 
the answers to these questions. I 
think that’s important for college 
students specifically to have those 
kinds of relationships especially 
at this time because we’re all at a 
formative stage of our lives.”

Nielsen said she and Sakallah 

had discussed hosting 36 Ques-
tions as a way to offer an alterna-
tive to “hook-up culture.”

“On the romantic side, for 

people who are looking for that, 
on a college campus, you’re not 
really getting into these deep 
relationships,” she said. “A lot of 
times everyone’s so caught up in 
their classes that you miss a lot 
of opportunities to really get to 
know people that you’re suppos-
edly close to.”

Moving forward, Sakallah and 

Nielsen said they plan to make 
36 Questions a series of national 
pop-up events. Sakallah said she 
had a friend in San Francisco 
who had a similar idea and had 
held a successful event similar to 
36 Questions last week.

“We kind of decided that we 

were going to launch this whole 
thing and have a bunch of events 
all over the country,” Sakallah 
said. “Ann Arbor is just one out 
of a bunch.”

n Cuba, the walls of buildings are often 
only partially painted. There are swaths 
of yellows, pinks and blues before they 

taper off to reveal cold, 
blank chunks of stucco and 
stone. The unfinished aes-
thetic extends far beyond 
the paint jobs. It’s seen in 
the houses that haven’t 
changed since 1959 and 
the holes of the chalk-
boards that lie tilted on 
the walls of a University of 
 

Havana classroom.

Driving 
along 
the 

Malecón, 
the 
oceanside 

promenade that stretches 
along the coast for miles, 
one sees the silhouette of 
tall buildings — spread apart, dark and empty. 
There are no recognizable signs or shimmer-
ing lights along doorframes — just old, faded 
architecture on one side and the ocean erod-
ing a stone barrier on the other. The vision, 
written out, sounds bleak. But it’s beautiful 
for what it is — its hollowness, its singularity, 
its antiquity. It’s free from becoming a string 
of shops that all look the same, sell the same 
things and discontinue a culture dedicated to 
the scarcity of materialism.

My grandmother, originally from Roma-

nia, grew up in Mexico. Escaping the Nazis 
during World War II, she and her family 
moved from Bucharest to Paris to the south 
of France to Mexico City, where she lived 
until her studies brought her to the United 
States. Before she died, she wrote a collection 
of memoirs for her grandchildren — bound 
together in a spiral notebook consisting of 
150 pages.

When she writes about her adolescence 

spent in Mexico, she mentions the colors, 
the warmth, the dogs and cats and birds that 
nested themselves within her home. She writes 
about the city of fishermen, the beautiful, clear 
ocean from which they fished and the small 
group of cliff divers, known only by the locals. 
One would never guess that the city which 
she describes — idyllic and quaint — is in 
fact Acapulco, presently bustling with spring 
breakers, cheap hotels and A-line restaurants.

In her memoir, my grandmother men-

tions that she returned to Mexico City with 
my grandfather 30 years after leaving the 
country, only to be greeted by air thickened 
by fumes, severe economic disparity and the 
disturbing implications of tourism and time. 
She vowed never to go back after that, and 
never did.

When I returned home from Havana in 

May of 2014, after having studied there for 
four months, I had dreams about the embargo 
being lifted. I imagined that during the 2016 
presidential election, Hillary Clinton would 
win, would somehow make Congress lift the 
embargo and I’d go back to Cuba. I thought 
of how my Cuban friends and then-boyfriend, 
Alberto, would fare in a new Cuba — one 
that was no longer avoided by the free world. 
When I lived there, the majority of problems 
plaguing my friends were those associated 
with the economy — shortages, rations, the 
general lack of money — and ironically, the 
reason we were all probably friends in the first 
place. At the time, I hated the embargo, and I 
hated socialism even more, because in order 
to maintain a participatory workforce, it held 
those who I loved on the island captive.

After a formative four months, I came back 

to America and time went by. I went back to 
throwing all of my waste in the trashcan as 
opposed to reusing it, going to the grocery 
store only to let my tomatoes go bad a week 
later, shopping for T-shirts I’d wear three 
times. Back in Cuba, Alberto had two shirts 
and one pair of pants that he washed with a 
bar of soap and a bucket of water every few 
days. When in Cuba, I resented the system 
that made dispensability impossible. But back 
in America, once the small and painful daily 
realities of Cuban life faded away from my 
consciousness, I began to reestablish my faith 
in the functionality of socialism.

In the fall, I took a class on Latin American 

Revolutions, and when we studied the Cuban 
Revolution I thought, Damn. Che and Castro 
accomplished some serious shit. They made 
the country, previously rife with inequality, 
socialist within a matter of years. But my new 
opinions, formulated within an academic 
context, negated ones I’d formed while actu-
ally living amongst socialism — that humans 
are inherently too selfish, too individualistic, 
not to crave economic progress. That aside 

Cuba’s hollow beauty

O

n Feb. 8, Central Student Government President Bobby 
Dishell, a Public Policy senior, announced the creation of a 
task force to develop a student honor code for the University. 

This new code would serve as an addition to the University’s pre-
existing Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities with 
the goal of addressing academic integrity, individual behavior and 
student rights. While attempting to put the University community’s 
values in writing is a commendable effort, the creation of a new 
honor code is a misguided attempt to influence the behavior of 
students at the University.

Released in 1996, the Statement of Student 

Rights and Responsibilities incorporates 
aspects 
of 
“civility, 
dignity, 
diversity, 

education, equality, freedom, honesty, and 
safety” into its objective. It informs students 
on acceptable behaviors that the University 
values and the actions taken if they are 
violated. The final chapter of the Statement 
also provides sanctions and intervention 
plans for violations of any of its standards

In the press release, Dishell stated, 

“The aim of the task force, and eventually 
the honor code, will be to encourage and 
motivate students to hold ourselves to a 
higher standard.” He added, “Currently, 
there is not one place where students can 
turn to in order to know what our community 
stands for.” Since it is commonplace for 
large institutions to implement a wide-scale 
honor code, something the University is 
lacking, developing this code is worthwhile. 
However, it is naïve to believe a new honor 
code will achieve what Dishell hopes. A brief 
written statement on its own will simply not 
be successful in motivating positive behavior 
across campus.

If CSG is serious about taking steps to 

improve campus behavior, it should focus 
on more tangible initiatives. CSG should 
begin by convening forums throughout 
the year for student organizations that 

receive funding through CSG to facilitate 
open dialogue and discussion on positive 
behaviors. 
Participation 
in 
this 
forum 

should be mandatory, and in order to ensure 
members of the 1,000-plus organizations 
attend, yearly CSG funding totaling more 
than $300,000 should be withheld until 
they actively participate. By doing so, the 
student population that is involved in 
clubs will be directly engaging with the 
goals of the Statement and honor code. The 
generation of open dialogue within clubs 
will increase social pressure and incentivize 
students to abide by and respect the honor 
code and Statement. This plan of action will 
undoubtedly be more effective than having 
another document to read that will ultimately 
be tossed aside. And for those not involved 
in student organizations, the honor code 
should be heavily advertised and promoted 
around campus.

CSG must also address which social factors 

hinder the current ideals of the Statement 
from being integrated into students’ conduct 
on and off campus. By bringing relevancy, 
value and respect to the honor code through 
open dialogue, peer-led discussions and group 
intermediaries, CSG can impact the social 
atmosphere from which these behaviors stem 
and generate positive relationships between 
students and the honor code proactively.

A few weeks after 9/11, I remember 

walking 
down 
the 
playground 

with my best friends, Maureen and 
Kathleen, after a tiring day of first-
grade arithmetic and grammar.

I was a timid, skinny six-year 

old with large brown eyes and silky 
black hair cut to my shoulders; my 
only thoughts must have been about 
what food will be served during 
lunch, the latest episode of Arthur 
and my newborn sister.

As we walked, I remember sens-

ing Maureen and Kathleen being 
standoffish. I remember them walk-
ing a few steps in front of me, whis-
pering to each other and looking 
back at me.

As the three of us convened in 

our usual hangout under the slide 
and behind the monkey bars, I qui-
etly asked what was wrong. The two 
looked at each other, and then Mau-
reen, her usually gentle blue eyes 
glaring at me behind her glasses, 
her usually pale cheeks and ears 
a soft pink in the September chill, 
spat, “Allana, it was your people that 
killed everyone in New York.”

I don’t remember the exact 

events of what followed, but I do 
remember my vision going dark. I 
remember looking around the play-
ground and not seeing colors, only 
seeing the trees and sky in different 
shades of gray.

According to my father and faint 

memories, I cried throughout the 
rest of the day. Unable to articulate 
my shame and fear, and already 
over-sensitive, I took to quietly 
sobbing into my sleeve and sitting 
away from my peers, perhaps fear-
ing retaliation from the rest of the 
class, perhaps scared I would hurt 
one of them, too.

My teacher took me aside during 

class and asked me what was wrong. 
Repeatedly she asked, and I only 
responded with more furious cry-
ing. Exasperated, she sent me to the 
principal’s office and called my dad.

When he arrived, I quickly 

recalled what had happened as the 
tears continued to fall down my 
face. He went to go tell my teacher, 
and they both agreed to devote the 
last 20 minutes of the day explain-
ing to the group of first graders 
how not all Muslims are killers, 
how Islam is not synonymous with 
terror. Maureen apologized to me 
after class.

* * *
Years had gone by. Almost rou-

tinely we would hear stories from 
relatives, 
friends 
of 
relatives, 

friends of friends on their various 
Islamophobic attacks. One eve-
ning, my father told the story of my 
teenage cousins being taunted and 
assaulted by their neighbors while 
playing basketball outside; another 
day, my mother recounted how our 
mosque had been vandalized and 
racial slurs painted on the walls; 
soon after, my grandmother called 
my parents anxiously revealing that 
my uncle had been detained while 
visiting Chicago.

We were coming back from a fam-

ily vacation in Mexico. I aged about 
three years, but remained shy and 
gangly. My sister was now a ram-
bunctious toddler and my brother 
walked hand in hand with my mom.

As my family and I slowly made 

our way through the painfully long 

line in immigration, tired and hun-
gry from being on a plane for six 
hours, we ached to go home. Finally 
our turn had come, and we made 
our way to the singular glass booth 
where a large white man, balding 
and barely squeezing into his baby-
blue TSA button down, meticulously 
watched us approach.

He took our passports and began 

to analyze. We stood in front of the 
booth as three, four, five families 
behind us in line had been approved 
by other officers and went to 
retrieve their luggage. My mother’s 
arms grew tired carrying the weight 
of my sister.

More agents arrived at our cubicle. 

They looked over my father’s pass-
port, scrutinizing the profile of his 
tan skin and black mustache.

Without giving reason, they took 

us aside and said we needed to stay 
here a little bit longer than usual. I’m 
sure they assumed our dark hair and 
complexion, my parents’ accented 
English, and our last name “Akhtar” 
were reason enough for suspicion.

I then watched as my father, the 

top of all of his classes in high school 
and college, the first in our family 
to become a doctor, the owner of a 
thriving private practice devoted to 
treating patients with cancer and 
leukemia, lead away from us to be 
interrogated for suspected terrorism.

I remember my mom trying to 

pacify my agitated siblings while 
waiting patiently to hear back from 
the TSA. We sat on the floor of the 
airport (they did not offer us chairs), 
under the imperious gaze of a self-
proclaimed 
Homeland 
Security 

agent (didn’t he understand that this 
was my homeland, too?).

An officer returned with our lug-

gage. Immediately, he and his friend 
broke the locks and unpacked every 
item inside the bags. I watched a 
strange man pick apart the items 
in our luggage that my mother 
painstakingly organized for days; 
I watched his gloved hands touch 
her undergarments; I watched the 
others at the airport look over at us 
as they walked past, like we were a 
roadside accident or a circus act.

I watched in rage as they laughed 

amongst themselves, ignorant to 
the ostracism and humiliation of 
my family. Their decision to racial 
profile was thoughtless and I’m 
sure they forgot about it soon after, 
yet they will never know the years 
and years of shame and embarrass-
ment this inflicted on me.

Eventually my father returned, 

his search proving null and our lug-
gage of bathing suits and sunscreen 
verified as bomb-free. We returned 
home, my mother made us scram-
bled eggs, and we went to sleep.

* * *
Now I am almost 20 years old, no 

longer as gangly yet still timid.

As I watched stories unfold 

reporting the uptick in anti-Mus-
lim hate crimes after the Charlie 
Hebdo shooting in Paris, the surge 
in online threats upon the release of 
Clint Eastwood’s “American Snip-
er” and, perhaps most haunting, the 
killing of three Muslim-Americans 
in North Carolina, these memories 
of mine resurface and I am forced 
to reconcile the profound and last-
ing effects my exposure to Islamo-
phobia had on me.

Some of my most prized child-

hood memories have to do with my 
Pakistani-Muslim identity: putting 
henna on my palms with my cousin 
on the stairs of her condo for Eid, 
visiting my grandparents’ house in 
Pakistan and making roti with their 
housekeepers, and praying maghrib 
alongside my father every evening 
when he came back from work.

However, after 9/11 and into my 

adolescence, I turned my back on 
these features of my life that I felt 
separated me from everybody else. 
I yearned to escape from the endur-
ing shame after being told “my 
people” killed nearly 3,000 lives. I 
ached to forget the humiliation of 
having to sit on an airport floor for 
four hours because my dad’s skin 
was too brown.

I detested my parents’ strict “no 

dating, no sleepovers, no alcohol” 
policy. I hid the fact I volunteered 
at my mosque every Sunday from 
my peers and soon stopped going 
when I no longer wanted to associ-
ate with religion. I cringed at my 
mother’s thick Pakistani accent 
when she would speak to my teach-
ers, or the clothes she bought me 
that would cover up my legs and 
arms even in the summer.

With these instances of reject-

ing my culture, I blamed Islam for 
my own sense of estrangement in 
school and society. I felt that by 
following the culture of my peers, 
these instances of discrimination 
would cease to exist and that I could 
finally feel accepted. I thought that 
if I could use makeup to lighten my 
skin, wear more revealing clothing 
and party more often, I would stop 
feeling like the only brown girl in 
the room and being seen as such.

And now, with the onset of these 

larger attacks demonstrating the 
existing prejudice people harbor 
against my identity, I continue to 
struggle with trying to reconcile 
with my feelings of self-hate. How 
am I supposed to love my identity 
when people exist who vehemently 
express their rejection of it? How 
can I stop feeling like an “other,” 
like an outsider, when I’m constant-
ly being viewed as one?

The truth is I haven’t yet 

embraced my identity. I still feel 
the need to use an American accent 
when I pronounce my last name and 
disassociate myself from the larger 
Pakistani-Muslim community.

However, I hope that maybe 

through expressing my feelings of 
estrangement, I will one day be able 
to come to terms with the skin and 
heritage I was born with.

For me, the worst part about 

hearing of these racist attacks 
is knowing they will give rise to 
another generation of ashamed 
Muslim boys and girls, who too will 
cry years later at the humiliation of 
being stopped at an airport.

I hope through sharing these 

memories I can reach out to other 
outsiders who suffer similarly from 
Islamophobia. In sharing these 
memories, I hope I can receive 
guidance from others on how to 
fight my persisting shame, or so 
that we may help each other learn 
to stop hating ourselves.

“Your people”

from an aesthetic standpoint — 
one that favors a highly primitive, 
untouched visage — business that 
brings money and people and new 
life is needed.

Ironically, I found out that the 

United States would be restoring its 
relationship with Cuba during the 
final exam for my Latin American 
Revolutions course. During the last 
10 minutes, my professor rose up 
out of her seat, smiling, and on the 
chalkboard wrote giddily — “Obama 
has just restored diplomatic relations 
with Cuba.” I read this, scribbled 
down a few concluding sentences to 
an essay question, shoved the exam 
onto her desk, left the room and 
cried. That night I called Alberto on 
the phone — in the moment it was 
worth the million dollars a minute it 
costs to speak overseas to Cuba.

¿Como te sientes sobre todo? “How 

do you feel about all this?” I asked. 
Bien. “Fine,” he answered. “Listen, 
my love. Can you send some money?”

His apathy spoke mountains of 

truth — despite the exciting pros-
pect of dismantling an oppressive 

55-year-long 
blockade, 
Cubans 

aren’t going to see the positive 
implications for a while. The only 
people who’ll be benefitting now 
will be the travelers ooh-ing and 
ah-ing at 1950s-era cars. Until the 
embargo is, in fact, lifted, life for 
Cubans will remain the same — 
stagnant, poor, hopeless. Alberto 
will continue to ask me for money as 
he often does. What the opening up 
of Cuba will do, I fear, is the same 
thing that happens to all cities and 
countries that are overly accepting 
of the tourist’s dollar. Havana, I 
fear, will become to me what Mexi-
co City and Acapulco became to my 
grandmother — unrecognizable.

Scrolling through my Facebook 

newsfeed the other day, I saw 
pictures of a Cuba backdrop, clearly 
intended as a party theme, with a 
girl sitting in a beach chair, drinking 
out of a straw, captioned, “welcome 
to Cuba.” I shut my computer.

As my friend would say, “the hip-

ster reason” for my anxiety about 
Cuba’s future is in part due to the 
fact that everyone will soon be able 

to travel to the place that made me, 
me. For a week, they’ll lounge on 
beach chairs, drink out of coconuts 
and spin on dance floors with Cuban 
swingers at a salsa club. But, as tour-
ists, they won’t necessarily begin to 
understand the deep cultural, politi-
cal and anti-imperialistic history 
that cloaks the small and beautiful 
nation. Then, when more people 
visit for a week, everything — down 
to the coconuts — will get more 
expensive. It will create greater dis-
parity between Cuban citizens and 
tourists; it will convert it into the 
next Dominican Republic.

I drift between different lines of 

thought. This is what Alberto would 
want, I think to myself. This is what 
they need. But this validates that 
perfect socialism isn’t attainable 
there — a concept I’m reluctant to 
admit but finally do. Still, I hope 
that the hollow beauty along the 
Malecón remains the same. But I 
know it won’t.

Infra Eco Logi 
spans disciplines

Taubman installation 
explores renewable 

energy

By KATHLEEN DAVIS

Senior Arts Editor

Niched in downtown Ann 

Arbor, past the hustle and 
activity 
of 

Main 
Street, 

lies 
the 

Taubman 
College Liberty 
Research 
Annex, 
an 

impressive 
work 
and 

exhibition 
space owned by 
the University. 
Infra Eco Logi 
Urbanism, 
the current installation in the 
space, is a multi-year research 
project-turned-publication-
turned-traveling exhibit that 
highlights a proposal to unite 
the Great Lakes region in terms 
of infrastructure and energy 
resources. 

The project was created by 

research-based 
architecture 

studio RVTR, founded by Kathy 
Velikov, an assistant professor 
at the University, and Geoffrey 
Thün, an associate professor, 
who both work at the Taubman 
College of Architecture and 
Urban Planning. RVTR has 
locations in both Ann Arbor 
and Toronto, but the team is 
currently working locally to 
accommodate with the exhibit 
space. 

Infra Eco Logi Urbanism’s 

research spans over multiple 
disciplines, 
including 

urbanism, ecology and policy. 
The project is an exploration 
of the future of megaregions, 
defined as networks of cities 
and the sprawl between them, 
interconnected by topography 
and environmental systems. 

The exhibit itself is composed 

of several suspended screens, 
each featuring a different facet 
of the design process. The color 
scheme of black, white and 
fluorescent yellow is simple yet 
striking, bringing attention to 
the research more thoroughly 
than one could interpret just 
from the research manuscript. 

Velikov notes that the Great 

Lakes region, one of the most 
diffuse megaregions identified 
as 
the 
sprawl 
between 

Toronto, Chicago and Detroit, 
is rich in the promise of 
renewable energy, thanks to an 
abundance of water and wind 
provided by the lakes. Infra 
Eco Logi Urbanism explores 
how 
renewable 
resources 

could benefit the surrounding 
regions. The project focuses on 
the Great Lakes megaregion, 
and 
analyzes 
its 
potential 

based on a hypothetical United 
Nations-style 
agreement 

between the neighboring areas 
of Michigan and Canada. 

“Questions 
arise 
like, 

who is responsible for the 
algae in Toledo? Things like 
that change how we think 
about 
cooperation, 
politics 

and 
ecology 
regionally,” 

Velikov said. “Our research 
is, essentially, how can design 
approach this question?”

RVTR believes the creation 

of 
an 
area 
of 
suspended 

nationality between Canada 
and the United States would 
help solve these complicated 
issues of policy between the 
megaregion. Part of Infra Eco 
Logi Urbanism’s research was 
anticipating 
policy 
changes 

in 
a 
time 
of 
energy 
and 

technological changes.

“A 
big 
moment 
for 
us 

was 
when 
we 
decided 
to 

incorporate the politics and 
policy, and how that would 
effect 
things. 
It’s 
still 
a 

question that we keep working 
out,” Velikov said. “What is the 
relationship between design 
and politics and policy, that’s 
a really important challenge 
for us. We can conceptualize 
the new technologies, that’s 
almost the easier part, but 
reconceptualizing 
political 

situations 
and 
how 
that 

materializes 
becomes 
one 

of 
the 
more 
challenging 

questions of design and design 
exploration.”

What sets Infra Eco Logi 

Urbanism apart from many 
other urban planning designs 

is the focus on the places 
outside 
the 
city 
that 
are 

still heavily impacted by the 
metropolitan, rather than the 
cities themselves. These areas, 
Velikov 
notes, 
are 
equally 

important 
to 
tackle 
when 

discussing the urban sprawl. 

The process of beginning the 

exhibit began with analyzing 
these regions, which involved 
looking at urban systems as 
networks. The project involves 
a host of mapping, a visual 
resource for visitors to envision 
what 
these 
megaregions 

look like and how they’re 
connected. One of the main 
issues of interconnectedness 
RVTR tackles is the issue 
of current highways, which 
Velikov and her team feel very 
strongly against. 

“The highway is a terrible 

waste of urban space, it leaves 
these ‘orphan lands’ and leaves 
all these vast territories empty 
and useless,” Velikov said. “If 
we were looking at it as a space 
where we could have more 
modes of mobility, more places 
where, say, electric vehicles 
could 
refuel, 
these 
spaces 

could become something more 
for the region as a site for new 
institutions 
and 
resources, 

and could do more for the 
populations 
that 
live 
out 

there.” 

Taking into consideration 

how 
transportation 
and 

energy will change in coming 
years, a bulk of Infra Eco 
Logi 
Urbanism 
is 
focused 

on 
retooling 
intraregional 

highways 
to 
accommodate 

ecologically friendly modes of 
transportation, for example a 
wind-powered high-speed rail 
proposed by the project. 

Though 
inching 
into 
the 

utopian, Infra Eco Logi Urbanism 
does a fantastic analysis into how 
renewable energy development 
will change the landscape of 
urban spaces, and has opened a 
fascinating discussion. 

“What we’ve hoped that the 

exhibition would do is to open 
people up to these questions,” 
Velikov said. “When you put 
forth a speculative proposal, 
the goal is to allow people to 
imagine 
something 
different 

and something that might be 
possible. For us, that’s a really 
important aspect of this kind of 
work. It’s not to say this position 
itself as a singular solution, but 
it’s meant to foster discourse 
and debate.”

The 
Academy 
Award 
for 

Best Original Song is presented 
annually to songwriters who 
have written and composed 
an original piece for a film. 
This year’s awards ceremony 
contains 
an 
especially 

interesting 
array 
of 
talent. 

Ranging from a surprising Rita 
Ora ballad to Glen Campbell’s 
heart-wrenching 
“I’m 
Not 

Gonna Miss You” to Tegan 
and Sara’s adorably aggressive 
“Everything is AWESOME!!!” 
featuring the silly Lonely Island 
boys, 
the 
nominations 
are 

seemingly sporadic with a few 
possible winners. But who truly 
deserves the golden man? And 
who is the likely victor? Let’s 
break it down: 

“I’m Not Gonna Miss You,” 
written by Glen Campbell 

and Julian Raymond

The 
highly 
celebrated 

country 
singer 
and 
former 

television host Glen Campbell 
captured his final tour this 
past year in the documentary, 
“Glen Campbell: I’ll Be Me.” 
The nominated song describes 
Campbell’s 
last 
optimistic 

and conscious thoughts as he 
has begun to lose his mind to 
Alzheimer’s disease. “I’m Not 
Gonna Miss You” speaks to his 
wife, “the last person I will 
love,” and the unique last selfish 
act the disease provides him, 
because at least “I’m not gonna 
miss you.” As the relatively 
simple 
music 
protects 
the 

purity and importance of the 
song’s message, “I’m Not Gonna 
Miss You” is working to remove 
the negative, misunderstood 
stigma of the disease. While not 
the first pick of many for the 
Oscar, this song fully deserves 
the attention provided by the 
nomination. 

“Grateful,” performed 

by Rita Ora and written by 

Diane Warren

For Diane Warren, victory is 

an impassable road. This famed 
songwriter, having penned hits 
for J-Lo, Bon Jovi, Whitney 
Houston and the like, has hit 
her seventh Academy Award 
nomination with her addition 

to the “Beyond the Lights” 
soundtrack, “Grateful.” It was 
surely 
Warren’s 
acclaimed 

name and noted songwriting 
talents that allowed such a 
relatively 
uncelebrated 
and 

unimpressive pop song slip 
into the nominations. Nothing 
about this song is new or 
groundbreaking 
enough 
to 

be recognized as the best of 
its kind for the year 2014. If 
possible, could someone even 
scratch out the song title, plead 
forgiveness from Ms. Warren 
and add Lorde’s “Yellow Flicker 
Beat” from “The Hunger Games: 
Mockingjay” soundtrack? 

“Everything is 

AWESOME!!!,” performed 
by Tegan and Sara featuring 
Lonely Island and written by 

Shawn Patterson

Here’s another song that may 

not be a top pick to represent the 
music of the movies we enjoyed 
in the year 2014. Maybe it is for 
those who drank a Red Bull and 
chased it down with an entire 
box of Nerds, but otherwise 
the stimulation that this song 
provides is far too aggressive 
and, at times, frightening. Andy 
Samberg, the former Saturday 
Night Live stud and Lonely 
Island 
founder, 
spurts 
out 

random gibberish in between 
the recurring “Everything is 
AWESOME!!!” 
declaration 
of 

the 
chorus 
with 
comments 

like, “I feel like an awesome 
possum.” Comparing oneself to 
extraordinary mammals? I guess 
that’s relatable for the viewers 
of a cartoon film. Should it win? 
No. Could it win? Yes. Would it 
be incredibly amusing to see it 
take home the little golden man? 
Absolutely. 

“Lost Stars,” performed by 

Adam Levine and written by 

Danielle Brisebois and Gregg 

Alexander 

John Carney took his time 

in completing another musical 
drama. Following the 2007 hit and 
“Best Original Song” Academy 
Award win from his Irish film 
“Once,” high expectations were 
left for Carney’s most recent 
project. “Begin Again” was a 
subtle 
recreation 
of 
Carney’s 

well-conceived 
personal 
film 

landscape to create a movie where 
the storyline is fueled by the love 
or creation of music. “Lost Stars,” 
in its performance by pop star 
Adam Levine, exists as the musical 
and cinematic crescendo of this 
simple film. Yet its lyricism is at 
times awkward, i.e. “Yesterday I 
saw a lion kiss a deer / Turn the 
page, maybe we’ll find a brand new 
ending / where we’re dancing in 
our tears. ” This is concurrently 
too empty and too full. The 
songwriters, Gregg Alexander and 
Danielle Briesbois, are reflected 
in the growth of this four and a 
half minute song. Insertions like 
the climatic yelps of the Levine’s 
recognizably high-pitched vocals 
reflect the sonic inspiration two 
former members of The New 
Radicals can only provide. While 
the lyrics remain convoluted at 
parts, and though the popularity 
of the movie never mounted that of 
Carney’s previous work in “Once,” 
“Lost Stars” is another respectable 
option for the Academy this year. 

“Glory,” written and 

performed by John Legend and 

Common

Legend and Common’s R&B 

and slow jam rap creation rings 
up as not only the strongest 
contender 
for 
the 
Academy’s 

award, but the most likely and 
predicted winner. Their song, 
“Glory,” maintains a collaboration 
of current social emphasis and 
talented musicianship that should 
act as the proud musical marker 
of the Academy for the year 2014. 
While the musical dexterity of 
“Glory” is relatively limited, the 
lyrics and vocal emphasis that the 
distinct voices of John Legend and 
Common provide convey a level of 
fervor that was surely present at 
the Selma to Montgomery voting 
rights marches of 1965, and even 
more recently on the streets of 
Ferguson, Missouri.

AKSHAY 

SETH

M

arion Cotillard cries. 
She bends over, she 
presses her hands 

on her knees, she tilts her head 
down and 
she patiently 
awaits the 
shudders, 
which come 
in quick 
spasms like 
an alcoholic’s 
post-Denny’s 
nausea. She 
vomits emo-
tion. She 
wraps her 
arms around 
her shoulders to cradle each 
tremor. She teeters through 
every gulp of air. She weeps into 
a pillow. She gazes forlornly out 
of windows. She forlornly gazes 
the shit out of windows. She 
melts those goddamned win-
dows. Then, a few scenes later, 
she cries some more. 

And we’re still transfixed. 
Watching Marion Cotillard 

cry — with all those little tour-
niqueted tics and red-faced con-
vulsions and mascara-streaked 
paroxysms — is a mythical thing, 
kind of like witnessing Tom Brady 
connect on a 60-yarder while 
being thronged by three J.J.Watt-
sized tissue boxes. It’s the ham-
mer she uses while nailing any 
attention span to any frame the 
second she steps through it, and 

ultimately, one of the many rea-
sons her name, over the last 10 
years, has become synonymous 
with scene-stealing, bravura act-
ing. 

Scene-stealing can’t be the 

right word. Can it? Most of the 
parts she’s taken since 2007 have 
had first or second billing, so in 
every sense of the term, she is the 
consummate leading lady; you’d 
expect her to be the one with her 
hands on the reins. She doesn’t 
steal scenes so much as over-
power them, crushing whoever’s 
sharing screen time underneath 
the weight of a giant tear duct. 
They set her up, she spikes some 
snot right back in their blank 
face, probably whispering “watch 
what’s about to happen, bitch” 
in a soft French accent into their 
ears, right before the cameras 
start rolling. But when one takes 
a step back, when one distances 
oneself from the emotional water 
fountain that is Marion Cotillard, 
then one realizes that this woman 
is also, perhaps, the only screen 
presence — male or female — to so 
perfectly embody despair, in all 
its nuance, in over a decade.

She’s made a career of it, to 

the point that watching her per-
formances can be an interest-
ing dissection project — one that 
gives us a glimpse at the anatomy 
behind effectively playing sad-
ness on film. What lets great 
actors pull off weepy? What 

makes their emotional heft reso-
nate across the screen? And what, 
specifically, allows us to pin our 
own thoughts, as wide-ranging 
and ephemeral as they may be, to 
what’s often nothing more than 
just a brief closeup of another 
human being’s face? The first step 
to these answers lies in the role 
that earned Cotillard an Oscar, 
thrusting her into the Holly-
wood limelight from which she’s 
methodically slunk in and out of 
consideration ever since.

In “La Vie en Rose,” Cotillard 

plays 20th century musical icon 
Edith Piaf, and for most of the 
film, that’s all she does — perfect-
ly mimicking mannerisms, cap-
turing the singer’s slight posture 
or her imposing voice. She’s the 
sponge sitting at movie’s center 
in the way so many other actors 
have sat the center of so many 
other biopics about so many other 
celebrated luminaries: what Dan-
iel Day-Lewis was to “Lincoln” or 
David Oyelowo to “Selma,” Cotil-
lard is to “La Vie en Rose.” She’s 
there in virtually every single 
frame, the gravity around which 
the scenes coalesce and the script 
revolves. Still, I’m sure some 
corny acting handbook some-
where expounds the reasons why 
“mimicry can never mimic great 
acting” — you need vulnerability 
for that — and it isn’t until the lat-
ter half of the film that we get a 
thorough first stab at those ques-

tions I posed earlier. 

When Piaf, after years of 

attachment issues, learns of her 
husband’s 
death, 
she 
breaks 

down. It’s an obvious response to 
an obvious, time-tested develop-
ment, yet how Cotillard embod-
ies it is nothing short of brilliant. 
Basic logic suggests she could 
have gone one of two ways with 
it. A: balls to the wall wailing. B: 
catatonic sorrow. But Cotillard 
is smarter than that. She incor-
porates shades of the melodrama 
and confusion that have been col-
oring the film thus far, so what we 
see on screen is that much deeper, 
that much more poignant than an 
“obvious” choice.

It may seem like plain sob-

bing, but what’s truly intrigu-
ing about the portrayal are her 
hands, though more so, her big, 
doe-like eyes. The hands shud-
der, vibrate with an intensity 
that evokes a woman in maudlin 
shock, or to some degree, rifling 
through some long-lost collection 
of memories. Her eyes accompa-
ny this point and move through-
out the frame, searching for what 
they know is gone. The result is 
a potpourri of instinct that feeds 
on open nerve endings and raw-
ness, melodrama and confusion. 
It’s the work of someone not just 
pulling off weepiness, but owning 
it without even an inkling of res-
ervation. It’s as cathartic as act-
ing can hope to be.

Cotillard sheds the brashness 

of that performance five years 
later in “Rust and Bone,” a film 
in which she’s cast as an orca 
trainer who loses both her legs 
after an on-the-job accident. 
It’s the type of role you’d expect 
the actress to shine in. Impos-
sible odds? Check. Top billing? 
Check. Room to experiment? 
Check. Crying? Check, check, 
check. What you don’t expect 
is silence, and that silence is 
exactly what Cotillard uses to 
bookend each of her scenes.
In the hospital room, after she 
learns about the amputations, 
we see her sobbing, then lulled 
into a blissful, resigned sleep 
that carries over her demeanor 
across the movie. Sitting across 
from a friend, discussing what 
used to be her sex life, Cotil-
lard takes pains to ensure that 
same silence is evident — a sort 
of stressed fortitude that feels 
almost dozy next to her work in 
“La Vie en Rose.”

The scene works because 

Cotillard’s face feels blank. The 
half-open eyes, uncurved mouth 
and pupils that feel lost in rev-
erie are anything but — they 
click in harmony to let the audi-
ence project onto them. When 
watching the exchange, it’s not 
so much as waiting for the spe-
cific, delineated response we’ve 
been trained to look for as it is 
letting our own thoughts wash 

over the screen. 

The key to depression, and by 

extension the key to despair, is 
numbness, a vacuum of person-
ality that Cotillard can balance 
with virtuoso emoting seem-
ingly at will. That tight-rope 
strings together the entirety 
of “Two Days, One Night,” in 
which her character struggles, 
heaves between two worlds, the 
first marked by tearful sobbing 
and the second by an acceptance 
withheld until the film’s final 
moments. 

The movie is a conduit of 

dualities. The frames are often 
obviously divided down the 
middle by a line to separate 
Cotillard and the person she is 
talking to. The dialogue itself is 
repetitive so audiences can eas-
ily chalk out the delineations 
between “saying” and “feeling” 
that the filmmakers intend for 
us to cling to. The central per-
formance becomes a combina-
tion of the actress’s work in “La 
Vie en Rose” and “Rust” — we’re 
walking toward the silence, but 
through a minefield of instinct, 
a river of apathy. Our guide is 
Marion Cotillard, the woman 
who’s made a career out of this 
journey. The ambassador of 
despair.

women crying. To send him 

yours, email akse@umich.edu.

Cotillard cries 

“The exhibition 
will open people 

up to these 
questions.”
This year’s 

awards contain 
an interesting 
array of talent.

Climactic sounds

MUSIC REVIEW

“Fifty Shades of 
Grey” a sensuous 

soundtrack

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

I spent an hour this weekend sit-

ting in awe of my iTunes visualizer 
as per usual, but this time it was 
different. I was 
also sitting in 
awe of the amaz-
ing 
diversity 

and talent pres-
ent on the slow, 
sultry and ulti-
mately 
immer-

sive 
“Fifty 

Shades of Grey” 
soundtrack. 
I 

was in awe of the 
classic sounds of 
Annie Lennox, Frank Sinatra and 
The Rolling Stones as well as the 
freshness of Laura Welsh, Jessie 
Ware and Skylar Grey. A plethora 
of A-list musicians and up-and-
comers came together to form the 
soundtrack seamlessly, with each 
song leading perfectly into the 
next, leaving listeners with a true 
sense of the story of Anastasia 
Steele and Christian Grey.

The album opens with an Annie 

Lennox cover of “I Put A Spell 
On You,” which was originally 
released on her cover album, Nos-
talgia, this past fall. The opener 
does exactly as promised; its repet-
itive piano notes and Lennox’s 
smooth, soulful delivery reign 
listeners in immediately. Moving 
from the classic to the contem-
porary, newcomer Laura Welsh 
sails through a catchy up-tempo, 
“Undiscovered.” 
Its 
beat 
will 

immediately have listeners tapping 
everything: feet, fingers, truly any-
thing that isn’t nailed down.

Next comes the two lead sin-

gles, “Earned It” and “Love Me 
Like You Do,” which I have spo-
ken highly of previously. Wedged 
between the two is “Meet Me In 
The Middle” by Jessie Ware, this 
track gets its merit from the pro-
duction. Several instruments take 
turns and work together to lie 
perfectly beneath Ware’s vocals 
(which are fantastic).

Beyoncé has two tracks, remix-

es of “Haunted” and “Crazy in 
Love,” both of which have been 
teased in trailers. No amount 
of remixing or remastering can 
make “Haunted” better than the 
original. That being said, Michael 
Diamond did a nice job of turning 
the track into soundtrack materi-
al. It focuses on beats that slither 
above the original bass line, rath-
er than resting solely on it. The 
new version of “Crazy in Love” 
is unexpected. Even the snippets 
in trailers did not really allude 
to what the full version would 
be. The “uh ohs” are much more 
jagged and explicitly murmured, 
transforming 
seduction 
into 

blatant sexuality. The orches-
tra is overpowered at times by a 
hard-to-identify clicking sound. 
Not what was expected, but not 
entirely bad either. 

The soundtrack’s largest dis-

appointment by far was Sia’s 
contribution (or lack thereof). 
“Salted Wound” is completely 
forgettable. The power she is able 
to exhibit while maintaining such 
grace should have been an asset, 
but instead it was ignored. The 
lyrics are nearly unintelligible 
and lack any emotion within the 
crooning delivery.

The remastered versions of 

“Beast of Burden” and “Witch-
craft” by The Rolling Stones 
and Frank Sinatra, respectively, 
are simply fabulous. Neither 
song immediately shouts “Fifty 
Shades,” but in conjunction with 
their fellow tracks they flow 
seamlessly. “Beast of Burden” 
paints a picture of dinner inside 
Mr. Grey’s Seattle penthouse. 
With every listen, “Witchcraft” 
works its way deeper into the 
story. Lyrics like “I know it’s 

strictly taboo / When you arouse 
the need in me / My heart says yes 
indeed in me / Proceed in what 
you’re leading me to” narrate the 
story beautifully, while Sinatra’s 
finesse adds polish.

AWOLNATION’s 
“I’m 
On 

Fire” and The Weeknd’s encore 
“Where You Belong” fall amongst 
the 
more 
forgettable 
tracks. 

“Where You Belong” does not 
come close to the bar set by The 
Weeknd’s “Earned it” while the 
cover of Bruce Springsteen’s “I’m 
On Fire” simply never delivers. 
AWOLNATION, best known for 
“Sail,” deserved a more climactic 
(pun intended) track.

Finally, the two most recent 

iTunes-official tracks: “One Last 
Night” by Vaults and “I Know 
You” by Skylar Grey. “One Last 
Night” is reminiscent of a tiny sad 
piano on a person’s shoulder, but 
less sarcastic. It yearns for more 
and more, but never gets what it 
is asking for; however, it certainly 
gives listeners what they needed. 
Skylar Grey comes in strong on 
“I Know You”: She holds her own 
and leaves listeners wanting more.

Now, in the spirit of full dis-

closure, the soundtrack does 
end with two beautifully crafted 
scores by the amazing Danny Elf-
man. It is hard to really under-
stand these tracks without their 
visual counterparts, but they are 
indeed promising to say the least.

A soundtrack aims to be indic-

ative of a films story, and “Fifty 
Shades of Grey” does exactly that. 
It mesmerizes; it has a strong cli-
max; it’s saturated with smooth 
seduction. If the actors in the 
film match the talent present on 
its soundtrack, it will surely blow 
viewers away.

“This contract ... is binding.”
Movie theater merits

By REBECCA LERNER

Daily Arts Writer

“Do you want to go to the mov-

ies?” The phrase echoes through 
American culture, evoking imag-
es of awkward teenagers making 
date plans, friends organizing 
an outing and families having 
wholesome fun. For decades, a 
trip to the movies was a staple 
of the American experience. But 
lately, that staple has begun to 
come undone. 

Fewer Americans are seeing 

movies in theaters. While movie 
prices increase, the number of 
tickets sold has dropped nearly 11 
percent between 2004 and 2013, 
according to a report from the 
Motion Picture Association of 
America. Speculated causes for 
the jettison of the movie theater 
range from online streaming to 
rising prices to overall laziness. 

There is certainly something 

to be said for unwinding with a 
movie in bed or on a couch with-
out having to face weather or 
other people. After an exhausting 
day of dealing with the approxi-
mately 40,000 people on this 
campus, it can seem like a gift 
to fall into someone else’s world 
without even leaving your bed-

room. If I’ve learned anything 
from the enlightened reflections 
of my peers on the app Yik Yak, 
it’s that college students are more 
than happy to use sites like Net-
flix and Hulu as fodder for our 
procrastination. 

Theaters are hoping to prove 

there’s more to the experience 
they offer than meets the eye 
by making not the movie, but 
the actual theater, the center of 
attention. To distinguish them-
selves from the comfortable 
atmosphere of a home, many the-
aters are becoming increasingly 
high end with reserved seating 
and gourmet food. Over winter 
break, walking into the my child-
hood movie theater was a shock 
to my nostalgic system. It was 
transformed from my quaint, 
dirty and cheap theater to a bou-
gie hell with waiters serving your 
choice of prosciutto and melon 
balls or puff pastry kisses. Upon 
arriving and being introduced 
to the iPads that would be seat-
ing us as opposed to an actual 
human being, my technologically 
impaired parents were ready 
to get out their flip phones and 
reject the experience altogether. 
We decided against popcorn that 
cost almost as much as the tick-

ets and finally got into our seats, 
which the iPad had so kindly pre-
pared for us. 

But then came the most impor-

tant part– the unity of a theater. 
A bed or couch just can’t repli-
cate the experience of a room full 
of excited strangers who quiet 
down when the lights dim or the 
joy of an entire theater crack-
ing up at the same joke. When 
Seth Rogen’s newest movie, “The 
Interview,” was available for 
streaming, he described his ideal 
situation for it’s viewing with the 
tweet: “I need to say that a come-
dy is best viewed in a theater full 
of people, so if you can, I’d watch 
it like that. Or call some friends 
over.” The shared emotions of 
everyone in the theater contrib-
utes to the intensity of the highs 
and lows that film can achieve. 
While watching a movie in a 
familiar setting is nice enough, 
there is beauty in the anonymous 
cover of darkness of a theater 
where you can laugh, blush or cry 
if you need to. 

The coming years will decide if 

we stay in our cocoons, clutching 
at our laptops, or if we walk out 
blinking into the bright lights, 
marching to the beat of the songs 
playing in the credits.

What is love on TV?

By HAILEY MIDDLEBOOK

Daily Arts Writer

February is such an unsexy 

month. School is beginning to 

get in the “swing of things” 

if you’re the cheery type. More 
realistically, it’s slapping you in 
the face with exams and dead-
lines, and making you cry softly 
into your Ben & Jerry’s. On top 
of this, the weather — I’ll spare 
you more whining — can be 
described in three words: nasty 
black slush. It gets in your way, 
on your pants and into your not-
so-waterproof boots, making 
it impossible to wear anything 
remotely 
attractive 
(unless 

you’re secretly Blair Waldorf 
and have four layers of cash-
mere under your trench coat — 
in which case: way to shove it in 
February’s ugly face). 

If you’re me, it’s a slow trek 

to the gym in the mornings, 
sweatpants stuffed into salt-
stained boots and running shoes 
held aloft for balance. I make it 
my mission to hop on a tread-
mill closest to any TV showing 
Bravo, the lone drama network 
among a dozen ESPN screens. 
Without sound or even subtitles, 
it’s a stretch to call it watching 
TV — really I’m just making up 
the story while glammed-up 
housewives and sweaty chefs 
whirl about the set. My favor-
ites are the shows where body 
language is crucial and words 
aren’t necessary to know what’s 
happening — specifically, dating 
shows. Or perhaps better known 
as the greatest romantic feat of 
the 21st century: a play-by-play 
of “real” people falling in “real” 
love, for the entertainment (and 
even inspiration) of viewers 
everywhere. 

Our culture is obsessed with 

the idea of love — falling in it, 
hating it, making it and falling 
in it all over again. With every 
sarcastic column on how to plan 
the perfect anti-Valentine’s Day 
“fuck love” party, there’s an 
equally popular Tumblr feed 
called “Relationship Goals,” dis-
playing the kind of gooey cou-
ple pictures that would make 
Nicholas Sparks melt in his 
seat. Films like “The Notebook” 
teach us that our soulmates are 
out there somewhere, pining 
away and building the future of 
our dreams. “Hitch” dials back 
the romantic factor a bit, admit-
ting that maybe our soulmates 
aren’t already in love with us — 
but if we play the game right, we 

can win them over in just three 
dates. 

Then there’s the world of 

TV, where drama and real-
ity clash, and the line between 
true romance and acting the 
part becomes a hot, complicated 
mess. On Bravo’s “Millionaire 
Matchmaker,” now in its eighth 
season, Patti Stanger is the real-
life version of Will Smith’s char-
acter in “Hitch” — as CEO of the 
Los Angeles-based Millionaire’s 
Club, she offers her professional 
matchmaking services to the 
rich and single. Technically, 
Stanger doesn’t require her 
clients to be millionaires, but 
she charges $10,000 for an in-
person lunch date. For the more 
money-conscious, a one-hour 
Skype chat is just $3,000.

Once a client comes to the 

Millionaire’s Club, he or she is 
matched with various singles 
in the area that meet speci-
fied criteria (yes, “young and 
hot” are favorites among these 
love hounds), then the couples 
arrange to meet for several 
elaborate dates, testing the 
waters before one — hopefully 
— clicks. Stanger says, “We have 
an extremely high success rate; 
nearly four out of five clients get 
into a relationship with our ser-
vice.” 

So really, everyone is happy 

— the lonely, too-busy-to-date 
millionaires land relationships, 
Stanger and her Club rake in 
clients and cash and viewers 
nationwide get to watch the 
whole process of love unfold 
before them. My question to the 
audience, then, is if they real-
ly believe it. Do people watch 
shows like “Matchmaker” and 
ABC’s “The Bachelor” earnest-
ly, living vicariously through 
fairytale-esque dates, because 
they trust the pair’s onscreen 
confessions of love? Or are they 
the more cynical “anti-Valen-
tine’s Day” types who watch for 
the trainwreck encounters, like 
sports fans who secretly cheer 
for NASCAR collisions? 

I’d like to think it’s some of 

both. Maybe our feelings about 
love are like our feelings about 
February snow — beautiful and 
pure at times, then dirty and 
inconvenient at others. And like 
it or not, we all have to live with 
it.

Michigan opens with 
three games out West

By ISAIAH ZEAVIN-MOSS

Daily Sports Writer

For the Michigan baseball 

team, last season’s campaign 
focused 
on 

building 
strength 
and 

cohesion.

With a team 

composed 
of 
mostly 

underclassmen 
under 
the 

tutelage 
of 

second-year 
coach 
Erik 

Bakich, 
the 

Wolverines 
struggled 
to 
find 

consistency, falling to Nebraska 
in the fourth round of the Big 
Ten Tournament. Ultimately, 
they were not granted a bid to 
the NCAA Tournament.

As Michigan begins its season 

this weekend with a trip to Long 
Beach State for a three-game 
swing, hope abounds. And the 
Wolverines are excited about 
much more than the warm 
California sun.

For senior captain infielder 

Eric Jacobson, this is the year 
the Wolverines take a step 
forward.

“This is one of the more 

confident teams we’ve had in 
my time here,” Jacobson said. 
“We know the expectations 
of this program for this year, 
and we really want to fulfill 
those.”

After a season of agonizing 

defeats — 17 losses came by 
two runs or fewer, including 
five in extra innings — Bakich 
is confident that those days are 
behind the Wolverines.

“Being a year older has 

huge value because of the 
repetition that we’ve had in 
those moments,” Bakich said. 
“We’re not going to feel the 
pressure, we’re going to apply 
the pressure.”

Despite the confidence that 

permeates 
the 
clubhouse, 

Bakich stressed the importance 
of taking things as they come 
and not letting his players get 
too ahead of themselves.

“This is the most important 

interview 
that 
I’ve 
ever 

given in my life because it’s 
happening right now,” Bakich 
said. “We have to have our 
players 
having 
that 
same 

intensity and focus, playing 
pitch to pitch.”

The Wolverines will look for 

a strong start against a Long 
Beach State team that, despite 
making it to the fourth round 
of the NCAA Tournament last 
year, lost a great deal of the 
depth that got it there.

The 49ers lost seven of their 

nine positional starters and 
come into the season fielding 19 

newcomers. Their most highly 
touted player is sophomore 
shortstop Garrett Hampson, 
who was selected to Collegiate 
Baseball’s All-Freshman Team 
last season.

“We know a lot about them, 

we’ve studied them,” Bakich 
said. “But really, the focus will 
be on our team doing what 
we need to do. It’s going to be 
more about us than about any 
scouting report or anything 
else.”

The 
Wolverines 
will 

begin the season with six 
consecutive road trips, all in 
different parts of the country. 
Their first game at Wilpon 
Complex won’t come until 
March 24. Before then, they 
will have played 21 games.

For any team, this is a 

daunting task. Well, any team 
besides Bakich’s, apparently.

“We’ll 
go 
play 
anyone, 

anywhere, anytime, any place,” 
Bakich said. “Six consecutive 
road trips? So what? It is what 
it is.”

Amine cousins keep 
wrestling in the family

By SYLVANNA GROSS

Daily Sports Writer

Teams tend to become a 

family, but for the Amines, the 
family became the team.

Mike Amine (1986-1989) was 

an NCAA finalist and four-year 
letterwinner at Michigan, and 
his brother Sam Amine (1988-
1990) was an NCAA qualifier. 
Both were Olympic alternates 
in 1992, and both are considered 
to be among the top Wolverine 
wrestlers 
of 

all time.

For 
their 

respective 
sons, redshirt 
freshman 
Malik Amine 
and 
redshirt 

sophomore 
Jordan Amine, the pressure and 
expectations have always been 
high because of their coaches and 
dads. But as they have matured, 
that pressure is coming more 
from within.

“The pressure for me was an 

issue for a while, it kind of held 
me back,” Jordan Amine said. 
“I never perform well under 
pressure, but I’ve done some 
mental retraining and cleared my 
head. But I’m not really here for 
my dad or my uncle or to live up 
to their expectations or anything, 
I’m here to live up to my 
expectations. I’m here to wrestle 
because I want to wrestle.”

And his dad agreed, reassuring 

him that “You’re here for you, not 
for me.”

The younger generation of 

Amines went to different high 
schools and competed in different 
weight classes, meaning the only 
time they faced each other was in 
their basement wrestling rooms, 

where their dads would coach 
them.

Though Jordan and Malik had 

offers from other top schools, 
they always had a feeling that 
they were Wolverines.

“For my senior grad party, my 

mom and I looked through my 
old journals, and I always wrote 
about coming here even when 
I was a little kid,” Jordan said. 
“Michigan has been a part of me 
for forever.”

Jordan had a season-ending 

ankle 
injury 

at the start of 
his sophomore 
campaign, 
eliciting 
some 

frustration 
since 
he 

couldn’t 
start 

on the mat this 

year, and didn’t have the chance 
to watch his cousin on it either.

“I planned on redshirting 

this year to get stronger,” Malik 
Amine said. “My technique is 
there, but my strength could be 
better.”

Malik often turns to Jordan 

to help with the transition 
from high school to collegiate 
wrestling, and with the addition 
of a rigorous course load, they 
have agreed on one thing.

“Academics first,” Jordan said. 

“Wrestling can only take you so 
far. It can teach you a lot of things 
and it gets you in a lot of doors, 
but it’s not like there’s a pro 
league. You have to focus on your 
career and what you’ll do after 
wrestling. I’m not here to waste 
my time.”

Added Malik: “You have to get 

through school and be a great 
wrestler and use what you learn 
on the mats in life.”

And a lot of what they have 

learned is how important the 
family tie is. The two grew up 
together, wrestled together, came 
to college together and will be 
living together next year.

“Our dads were like us — they 

butted heads but at the end of the 
day, they were cool,” Malik said. 
“Me and Jordan are like best 
friends.”

Best friends who are cousins 

but act like brothers, the Amines 
enjoy the tight-knit wrestling 
community that they’ve found in 
Ann Arbor. Michigan coach Joe 
McFarland was a senior when 
Mike Amine was a freshman, 
and teammate Alec Pantaleo’s 
uncle, Joe Pantaleo, was there 
as well.

The cousins still maintain 

their 
own 
identity 
despite 

their connections. Jordan and 
Malik joke that they are almost 
complete opposites.

“He likes snow,” Malik said. “I 

like going to the beach.”

The 
Amine 
legacy 
will 

continue next year with Malik’s 
brother Miles, who signed back 
in November. Neither Jordan 
nor Malik have any doubt that 
Jordan’s younger brother, eighth- 
grader Cameron, will become a 
Wolverine.

“It’s a great opportunity that 

some people take for granted to 
train with family,” Malik said. 
“But I realize how lucky I am.”

The Amine wrestling dynasty 

in Michigan will stay strong 
with a an emphasis on personal 
excellence, 
strength 
and 

technique, and a penchant for 
competition.

Because at the end of the day, 

it doesn’t matter who you are, or 
what family you come from. It’s 
about beating the other person 
on the mat.

“You’re here for 
you, not for me.”

Tough pitchers await ‘M’

By TYLER SCOTT

Daily Sports Writer

With the first weekend series 

in the books, the Michigan 
softball team has had time to 
reflect on its performance — 
ultimately deciding that there’s 
plenty 
of 

room 
for 

improvement.

“We didn’t 

hit our best 
(at the USF 
Classic) as a 
team,” 
said 

senior catcher 
Lauren 
Sweet. 
“We 

just 
need 

to come out 
ready to go, 
and act like 
every 
game 

is a Regional, 
Super Regional or World Series 
game.”

This week No. 7 Michigan 

(3-1) travels to Tallahassee, 
Florida to compete in the 
Unconquered Invitational at 
Florida State (4-1), where it will 
play two games each against the 
No. 5 Seminoles and Georgia 
Tech (0-5), and one matchup 
versus Western Kentucky (4-1).

For Michigan coach Carol 

Hutchins, the lack of offensive 
production so far this season 
highlighted Michigan’s other 

strengths.

“Probably the biggest highlight 

of (last week’s) trip is that we 
really underachieved at the plate 
… and we were 3-1,” Hutchins 
said. “We were able to pull out 
games, and play defense and pitch 
well enough (to win) without the 
offense playing its part.”

The Wolverines belted four 

home runs last week, and scored 
nine runs against Hampton, but 
also have seven players batting 
at .200 or below.

The games against Florida 

State and Western Kentucky 
will undoubtedly provide a 
true early-season test for the 
Wolverines’ developing offense. 
The Seminoles return right-
handed pitcher Lacey Waldrop, 
the 2014 USA Softball National 
Player of the Year.

And the Hilltoppers have a 

pitching threat of their own. 
Left-handed pitcher Miranda 
Kramer was named the most 
recent ESPNW player of the 
week. She became just the 19th 
player in NCAA history to strike 
out 19 batters in seven innings 
for Western Kentucky during a 
game against Troy.

“I’ve been scouting (Kramer) 

out and she’s really good,” 
Hutchins said. “We need to 
pitch well and play defense until 
our offense gets going.”

In a young season, getting 

a chance to play meaningful 

games is also just as much about 
smoothing out the offensive 
wrinkles as it is about the 
competition.

“We have to get used to having 

each other out on the field, 
getting used to this new team,” 
Sweet said. “I think that having 
this first weekend is going to 
help us a lot, whether you’re on 
the bench or getting one at-bat 
a game, just embracing the role 
that you have.”

It’s 
a 
concept 
echoed 

throughout the clubhouse.

“We just have to focus on 

taking it one game at a time,” 
said junior utility player Kelsey 
Susalla. “Every team is going 
to get better from game one to 
game 50. We just have to focus 
on the next game ahead.”

Given 
that 
Florida 
State 

eliminated Michigan from the 
NCAA softball Super Regionals 
in 2014, one would expect 
some edginess to the game, but 
Hutchins doesn’t find worth in 
dwelling on past experiences. 
Instead she sees an opportunity 
to play a high-caliber team 
that can contribute to the 
development of her team early 
in the season.

“You play tough competition 

and hopefully it hardens you,” 
Hutchins said. “Every week 
we run into top five teams, and 
I’m hoping we get better from 
it.”

With tournament hopes in 
balance, ‘M’ faces must-win

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Writer

Michigan women’s basketball 

coach Kim Barnes Arico doesn’t 
label any game as “must-win.”

With Tuesday’s heartbreaking 

77-73 loss at Ohio State, the 
Wolverines’ 
game 
on 

Saturday 
against 
Northwestern 
at 
Crisler 

Center 
may 

be 
as 
close 

as 
it 
gets 

to 
a 
“must-

win” to keep 
their 
NCAA 

Tournament 
hopes alive.

But 

Michigan (6-7 
Big Ten, 14-10 overall) won’t 
be the only team on the court 
desperate for a win.

With Northwestern (8-5, 18-6) 

in fifth place and the Wolverines 
in seventh, both teams sit on 
the NCAA Tournament bubble, 
and a win for either team would 
raise its profile for entry into the 
tournament.

But for Michigan to pull out 

a win, it’s going to have to move 
past its late game meltdown at 
Ohio State.

With less than 10 minutes 

left in the game, the Wolverines 
led by 12. However, foul trouble 
plagued 
Michigan 
as 
senior 

guard Shannon Smith and senior 
forwards Nicole Elmblad and 
Cyesha Goree played a majority 
of the second half with more than 
three fouls.

And even when they were on 

the court, they had to soften up 
to avoid fouling out of the game. 
The first player to foul out of the 
game was Goree at the 5:12 mark.

“(Goree’s) 
a 
completely 

different 
player 
when 
she’s 

in foul trouble, so that really 
affected our team,” Barnes Arico 
said Tuesday on WTKA. “That’s 
tough when you have arguably 
the best player in your program 
on the bench in foul trouble, so 

that took a big toll on us.”

But Barnes Arico chose to 

look at the foul situation from a 
positive standpoint.

“It gave some of our younger 

kids some minutes,” Barnes Arico 
said. “Hopefully, that’ll help us 
down the stretch.”

After a tough three-game 

stretch 
in 
five 
days, 
the 

Wolverines got a much-needed 
day off on Wednesday.

“We had our first day off in a 

super long time,” Barnes Arico 
said. “It was the first time our 
kids got to be normal students, 
to study for exams, to regroup 
mentally, and I think we’re going 
to come back super excited, super 
energetic about the final stretch 
of our season.”

On the other side of the court, 

Northwestern will come to Ann 
Arbor on a four-game winning 
streak, including a 73-65 overtime 
win at Purdue on Wednesday.

“Northwestern is having a 

great season, “ Barnes Arico said. 
“I think one of the best seasons in 

program history. They’re coming 
off an overtime win over Purdue, 
and they’ve won a bunch in a row 
coming into our game, so they 
will be fired up.”

The Wildcats are led in 

scoring by forward Nia Coffey, 
who scores 15.3 points per 
game. Coffey, who was the first 
ever freshman in Northwestern 
history to earn All-Big Ten First 
Team honors last season, also 
leads the team in rebound with 
nine per game.

But less than a month ago 

in Chicago, Coffey was held to 
just six points in Michigan’s 
73-66 win at Northwestern. 
Stopping Coffey on Saturday 
will be key once again if the 
Wolverines want to walk away 
with a win.

While Barnes Arico might not 

want to call Saturday’s game a 
“must-win,” a loss would drop 
Michigan to two games under 
.500 in the Big Ten.

And that may be a hole too 

large to climb out of.

Wolverines look to solidify place in PairWise Rankings

By JASON RUBINSTEIN 

Daily Sports Editor

The last time the Michigan 

hockey team faced off against 
Minnesota, coach Red Berenson 
recorded his 800th career win. 
Though the milestone won’t be 
as monumental, if Michigan can 
steal two wins in Minneapolis, 
the 12th-ranked Wolverines will 

propel themselves into a very 
steady position in the PairWise 
Rankings.

But that won’t come easily. 

No. 14 Minnesota (5-2-3 Big Ten, 
14-9-3 overall) will be espe-
cially hungry for two wins con-
sidering the Wolverines sweep 
of the Golden Gophers in a two-
game series in January. And a 
win against Michigan would 

significantly further their cause 
in the rankings.

“I’d say this is the biggest 

series of my career so far,” said 
junior forward Andrew Copp. 
“We took care of them when 
they were here in Ann Arbor, 
but we know that they are tough 
to beat out there.”

Added Berenson: “This will 

be the biggest test thus far going 

on the road to play Minnesota.”

Berenson’s sentiment is par-

tially rooted in the fact that the 
Wolverines 
haven’t won in 
Minneapolis 
in seven years. 
The 
drought 

can be partial-
ly 
attributed 

to 
Michigan 

(8-2, 16-8) not 
playing 
the 

Gophers regu-
larly until last 
season, 
when 

the 
Big 
Ten 

conference 
was formed.

But 
per-

haps the los-
ing 
streak 

in Minnesota is rooted in the 
Wolverines’ inability to adapt 
to a bigger rink. The Golden 
Gophers skate on an Olympic-
size ice sheet — 100 feet by 200 
feet — whereas Yost Ice Arena is 
just 85 feet by 200 feet.

And the extra space has 

caused the Wolverines some 
trouble in the past. This sea-
son, though, Michigan is unde-
feated while playing on larger 
ice sheets. Back in January, the 
Wolverines swept Wisconsin in 

its Olympic-size rink, scoring 13 
goals along the way.

“This team is excited to be 

playing on the big ice,” said 
senior forward Zach Hyman. 
“You 
saw 
how 
we 
played 

against Wisconsin in the big 
rink and we were excited that 
weekend.”

To simulate the game condi-

tions this weekend, Michigan 
practiced at the Ann Arbor Ice 
Cube this week, which has an 
Olympic-size rink. The Wolver-
ines did the same thing prior to 
the Wisconsin series.

Heading into the weekend, 

Michigan still leads the nation 
in scoring, tallying 4.21 goals 
per game. The Wolverines are 
also accomplishing this feat 
without one of last season’s 
leading scorers filling the stat 
sheet in forward JT Compher. 
The sophomore has just four 
goals and 13 points this season. 
Berenson isn’t concerned.

“I think JT is coming into the 

best part his season right now,” 
he said.

Despite the offensive prow-

ess, it’s likely that special teams 
will determine a large part of 
this series. Minnesota boasts 
the nation’s best power-play 
unit, converting just above 29 

percent — 30 of 103 — power-
play opportunities.

The last time the two teams 

met, the Gophers converted 
two 
power-play 
goals 
after 

Copp took a five-minute major 
penalty.

“That game was interesting, I 

guess,” Copp said with a smirk.

In recent games, the Wolver-

ines penalty-killing unit, largely 
headed by Compher, has been 
solid. A big reason for that is 
that Michigan takes very few 
penalties — the Wolverines rank 
36th in the country in penalty 
minutes.

“Just 
not 
taking 
many 

penalties 
is 
the 
key,” 
said 

freshman 
forward 
Dylan 

Larkin. “The best penalty kill 
is staying out of the box. That’s 
our mentality. But if we do, we 
are going to have to sacrifice our 
bodies and block a lot of shots.”

Larkin went on to say how 

important this series is for the 
Wolverines, especially consid-
ering the PairWise implications. 
More notably, getting two wins 
on the road at Minnesota would 
considerably boost this team’s 
already high morale.

“It can push this year into a 

special year,” Larkin said, “and 
we are all looking for that.”

‘M’ falters in OT

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

CHAMPAIGN — The Big 

Ten championship trophy was 
inside the State Farm Center 
the last time the Michigan 
men’s basketball team played at 
Illinois.

On 

March 
4 
last 

year, 
the 

Wolverines 
traveled 
to 

Champaign and left with the 
trophy and an 84-53 win. They 
scored 35 of the last 52 points of 
the first half, culminating with 
Nik Stauskas’ deep 3-pointer 
just before the halftime buzzer.

Michigan was back inside 

the same building Thursday, 
but with no conference title 
trophy in sight, with assistant 
coach LaVall Jordan out sick 
at the team hotel and with 
injured guards Caris LeVert and 
Derrick Walton Jr. at home.

The Wolverines were in for 

much more of a fight this time. 
Just as they were about to come 
away with a solid road win, Illinois 
battled back from a late second-
half deficit to force overtime and 
eventually win, 64-52.

The two teams also played 

in overtime Dec. 30 at Crisler 
Center, but the Wolverines (6-7 
Big Ten, 13-12 overall) were 
victorious on their home court. 
They haven’t had much luck since 
then in three extra sessions in the 
past six games.

“This is what, our third 

straight overtime loss?” said 
freshman 
guard 
Aubrey 

Dawkins. “It’s tough.”

The Fighting Illini (7-5, 17-8) 

put together a nearly flawless 
overtime 
period, 
outscoring 

Michigan 14-2 and snapping an 
eight-game losing streak in the 
series.

“I think there was a huge 

let-down that we didn’t win 

that game,” Beilein said. “(Our 
kids) didn’t have that same zest 
that I think you need to go into 
overtime.”

The run started with two 

free throws by guard Kendrick 
Nunn on the first possession, 
and Illinois kept its foot on the 
pedal for all five minutes. The 
Wolverines didn’t score until 
freshman guard Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman’s free throws 
with 13 seconds left.

Very little of the rest of the 

setting carried 
over from last 
season, and the 
outcome 
was 

no exception. A 
sellout crowd 
at 
the 
State 

Farm 
Center 

on 
“Orange-

Out 
Night” 

couldn’t 
will 

the Fighting Illini ahead until 
the final moments, as Michigan 
sustained 
momentum 
swings 

throughout the second half.

“We thought we had it,” 

Dawkins said. “We’ve been 
in that situation a lot, so we 
thought we could figure it out 
enough to win the game, but 
obviously it didn’t happen.”

But Illinois made one final 

push in the last two minutes. 
After 
forcing 
a 
five-second 

violation on the sideline, the 
Fighting Illini scored a quick 
bucket, and Nunn added a 
3-pointer with 1:21 left to tie the 
game. The teams traded misses 
— with Illinois’ coming on a 
block by sophomore forward 
Zak Irvin — and Michigan held 
for the last shot.

The Fighting Illini, which had 

three fouls to give, committed 
all three, then intercepted the 
inbounds pass but just missed a 
buzzer beater from half-court.

The 
Wolverines 
rotated 

defenses throughout the second 
half 
to 
keep 
the 
Fighting 

Illini from stringing together 
anything serious. Illinois shot 
just 39 percent from the floor.

“We’re getting better at it,” 

Beilein said. “I think we’re 
getting better at understanding 
our coverages at what we have to 
do. It does open us up for some 
rebounding, which hurt us a little 
bit. We’re working at a lot of things. 
That’s why we have an issue right 
now — we’re trying to do anything 
we can to stay in the game. … 
We’re not great at anything right 

now, and that 
gets 
exposed 

sometimes 
in 

games.”

Still, Illinois’ 

guard Malcolm 
Hill ignited the 
crowd with a 
3-pointer at the 
8:20 mark, but 
soon Michigan 

junior 
guard 
Spike 
Albrecht 

lobbed the ball up, caught it and 
flung it in while falling over on the 
baseline. When the Fighting Illini 
drew within four, Albrecht came 
back with a long triple with just 
over five minutes to play.

“He’s playing with everything 

he’s got,” Beilein said. “He’s 
really upset right now.”

The 
Wolverines 
played 

almost even on the glass starting 
with the first few minutes, 
when both teams went without 
a field goal for the first 4:50. 
An early Illinois run made it a 
10-6 game, but senior forward 
Max Bielfeldt scored two quick 
buckets and Dawkins added a 
triple as Michigan swayed the 
advantage back in its favor.

Moments 
later, 
Dawkins 

silenced the crowd with a 
monstrous dunk over Illinois 
center Nnanna Egwu. Dawkins 
finished 
with 
nine 
points, 

following his career-high 20 
point showing on Dec. 30, the 
first time the two teams met 
this season.

Inexperience dooms Michigan

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

CHAMPAIGN — At risk of 

dropping its fifth Big Ten game 
in six chances, the Michigan 
men’s basketball team turned 
to its upperclassmen — all two 
of them — to stem the tide on 
Thursday night at Illinois.

“All 
those 
young 
kids 

shouldn’t be in those situations,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
John 

Beilein, referring to the three 
true freshmen he started against 
the Fighting Illini. “They’re 
forced to be. We’ve got to get 
better at it.”

Instead, it was senior forward 

Max Bielfeldt and junior guard 
Spike Albrecht who took the 
reigns for Michigan.

Albrecht, whose health has 

been less than perfect throughout 
the season, gutted out 42 minutes 
in Michigan’s third overtime 
game in as many weeks, scoring 
13 points and recording five 
assists in the process.

Bielfeldt, 
making 
a 
final 

homecoming to the school that 
boasts his family’s name on its 
athletic administration building, 
was equally impressive, scoring 
12 points and recording seven 
rebounds.

But 
the 
upperclassmen’s 

combined effort wasn’t enough 
for Michigan, which continued 
a consistent trend of forcing 
overtime against teams with 
the on-paper advantage before 
collapsing during the added five 
minutes.

On Jan. 24, the Wolverines 

were 
outscored 
12-7 
by 

Wisconsin 
after 
sophomore 

guard 
Derrick 
Walton 
Jr.’s 

3-pointer tied the game in the 
final seconds of regulation.

A 
week 
later, 
Michigan’s 

post-regulation result was much 
worse — Michigan State went 
on a 10-0 overtime run that the 
Wolverines 
never 
recovered 

from. 
Michigan 
was 
held 

scoreless in the added period, 
and ultimately fell, 76-66.

The final five minutes of 

Thursday’s game were a mirror 
image of the Feb. 1 rivalry clash. 
Having already stormed back 
from a 50-43 deficit in the final 
minutes, 
Illinois 
scored 
the 

first 14 points of overtime to 
take a commanding 64-50 lead. 
Freshman guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman’s pair of 
made free throws in the final 
minute was much too little, and 
far too late.

“These late-game adjustments 

that we have to make … we 
haven’t been able to work at 
those as much because we’re 
still trying to dribble the ball, 
and catch the ball on two feet, 
and shoot the ball with good 
spin and the fundamentals of 
the game,” Beilein said.

One of the fundamentals 

that was severely lacking was 
Michigan’s ability to inbound 
the basketball. Abdur-Rahkman 
failed three times at getting 
the ball past Illinois’ 6-foot-11 
center Nnanna Egwu, seeing his 
first two attempts swatted away 
and committing a five-second 
violation on the third.

With 4.5 seconds remaining 

in regulation, Michigan had 
another opportunity to inbound 
the ball and set up a game-
winning shot. Again, its youth 
posed a major roadblock.

“I 
would 
love 
to 
have 

(freshman forward) Ricky Doyle 
throwing it in, but we do not 
have that type of passing from 
our big guys right now,” Beilein 
said. “Spike’s got to be the one.”

Albrecht’s pass was deflected, 

ultimately ending up in the 
hands of Illinois guard Rayvonte 
Rice. The Fighting Illini couldn’t 
score on their final possession, 
sending the game to overtime.

Had the inbounds play worked, 

Beilein had every intention of 
leaving an upperclassman with 
the final shot.

“We were gonna go with 

(Bielfeldt),” Beilein said. “He 
didn’t play a lot in the last game, 
but he’s a senior, this game means 
a lot to him, and we sort of had a 
hunch that we’d go with him.

“If we’d had the fouls to give, 

he was taking last shot if we 
were allowed to run the offense, 
and might have had three of four 
seconds. I dialed up something 
for him.”

Though Michigan’s best hope 

of closing out the victory — 
which would have been its first 
of the month — was vested in 
Albrecht and Bielfeldt, the sparks 
of the Wolverines’ talented youth 
were 
still 
there. 
Michigan’s 

coaching staff wasn’t shy about 
making sure its underclassmen 
understood their roles.

At 
a 
particularly 
quiet 

moment, 
Michigan 
assistant 

coach 
Bacari 
Alexander’s 

instructions 
for 
Doyle 
rang 

through the State Farm Center. 
“Rick! Rick! You got one job, son. 
Rebound the basketball.”

Doyle came up with a rebound 

on the ensuing possession.

That 
wasn’t 
even 
the 

most promising sign of the 
Wolverines’ impending youth 
uprising — in the first half, 
Andrew Dakich found Aubrey 
Dawkins on a backdoor cut, 
allowing Dawkins to finish 
with a ferocious right-handed 
slam that stunned the record 
crowd of 17,087 at the State 
Farm Center.

Though Michigan’s simple 

lack of depth, which forced 
Albrecht 
and 
sophomore 

forward Zak Irvin to play 42 
minutes and Abdur-Rahkman to 
play 43, was an obvious factor, 
Dawkins 
wasn’t 
willing 
to 

chalk up the repeated overtime 
collapses to a lack of fresh legs.

“It could be that,” Dawkins 

said. “I mean, I’m not going to 
use that as an excuse. We’ve still 
got to come out and find a way to 
win every night.”
