Each Wednesday, Lecturer 

David Cho flies from his home 
in Portland, Oregon to Ann 
Arbor to teach his Thursday 
sports management course in 
the Kinesiology Department. 
A little over 24 hours later, he 
flies back to Portland Friday 
morning.

“What inspires me is my 

connection to this place,” Cho 
said. “I am a law school and 
business school grad, I met 
my wife here and I have such 
strong ties to the University 
that the opportunity to teach 
my first class at Michigan far 
outweighs the time and travel 
to get here. For me, I always 
thought that if I did have the 
opportunity to teach it would 
start at a smaller university or 
a less prestigious university. I 
never thought I would get my 
first opportunity at a place 
like Michigan.”

Cho earned a J.D./M.B.A. 

at the University of Michigan 
in 
2006 
after 
graduating 

from 
Harvard 
University 

with a bachelor’s degree in 
Biochemistry. Cho is currently 
the director of partnership 
activation and event retail at 
adidas America.

In this role, Cho manages 

a team that operates adidas 
retail programs outside of the 
approximately 200 traditional 
adidas retail stores. His team 
manages the NHL New York 

City store and partners with 
events including ComplexCon, 
the U.S. Open and the Boston 
Marathon. Cho felt teaching 
was a natural progression in 
his career and something he 
had always wanted to do. He 
even thought of a course and 
created a rough draft of a 
syllabus before he met with a 
University representative.

The 
course 
Sports 

Marketing, 
Sponsorship, 

and 
Branding: 
Leveraging 

Athletes, Teams and Leagues 
in Today’s Dynamic Sports 
Landscape is divided into 
two halves. The first half 
is an evaluation of sports 
marketing 
assets 
such 
as 

athletes, teams and leagues. 
The 
second 
half 
focuses 

on 
athletic 
footwear 
and 

apparel business and how the 
product is put into market and 
consumer communication.

The 
course 
culminates 

in 
a 
final 
project 
in 

which students identify a 
hypothetical issue faced by an 
athlete, team, brand or league 
and use their knowledge from 
the class to devise a way to 
address the issue. During his 
time at the University, Cho 
completed this same project 
and he said it was this project 
that propelled him into his 
sports management career, 
beginning with a position at 
Nike.

Board of Trustees meeting 
Wednesday night, protesting 
the appointment of former 
Michigan Gov. John Engler as

Faculty liaisons to the board as

In the midst of criticism 

regarding 
its 
Campus 

Affordability Guide, Central 
Student 
Government 
has 

undertaken 
the 
challenge 

to rework the manual to be 
more inclusive and realistic 
for low-income students at 
the University of Michigan. 
Updates include a town hall to 
be convened Monday evening 
and a revised guide. 

The Affordability Guide, 

which has since been taken 
offline after its release last 
week, received many critiques 
from the student body. Many 
claimed it to be unrealistic for 
those who come from a lower 
socioeconomic status — the 
individuals who would most 
likely use this type of guide. 
Suggestions within the guide 
included reducing spending 
on eating out, laundry services 
and impulse spending.

LSA junior Griffin St. Onge, 

a 
first-generation 
student, 

voiced 
her 
dissatisfaction 

with the guide, despite a 
general feeling CSG has made 
valid efforts to alleviate the 
wealth inequality on campus. 
According to a report from 
the Equality of Opportunity 
Project, 
66 
percent 
of 

students at the University 
are in the top 20 percent 
of the income distribution. 
This reality is mirrored in 
CSG’s representation — in its 
2016 
self-survey 
assessing 

demographic 
background, 

74.4 percent of its members 
have household incomes over 
$100,000 a year, and 37.2 
percent of these households 
make over $250,000.

“There are a lot of really 

good parts in the second half 
that outline the housing crisis 
in Ann Arbor and the available 
resources for finding more 
affordable housing and things 
like that. But I think that in 
the first half, they tried to 
make it a kind of thing that’s 
useful or applicable to the 
‘average Michigan student’,”

Effort highlights current, past policies creating unequal outcomes for residents

While 
Ann 
Arbor 
is 

consistently named the bestplace 
to live and known as the most 
educatedcity 
in 
the 
United 

States, the surrounding areas 
of Washtenaw County know a 
different reality.

Washtenaw County is the 

eighth 
most 
economically 

segregated metropolitan region 
in the country, according to a 
city press release. Moreover, 60 

percent 
of 
African-American 

residents 
live 
in 
“low-

opportunity areas with limited 
job growth” and there is a 10-year 
life expectancy gap between 
African-American 
and 
white 

residents –– 16 years between 
Latino and white residents.

Those statistics come from 

“One 
Community: 
Advancing 

Racial Equity in Ann Arbor 
and Washtenaw County,” an 
initiative 
launched 
Monday. 

The numbers reveal segregation 
and a racial divide in health, 
job 
opportunities, 
income 

and education throughout the 
community.

In an effort to address these 

inequities, 
One 
Community 

integrates government officials 
from both the city of Ann 
Arbor and Washtenaw County 
to 
discuss 
education 
and 

public policy reformation. The 
initiative is a joint effort with 
the Government Alliance on 
Race and Equity –– a nationwide 
network of governments that 
strives to achieve equity for all. 
GARE led a session Monday on 
anti-racism training for about 

80 elected officials and staff 
members from the city and 
county, and focused on educating 
officials and providing them with 
tools to begin to address inequity 
in Ann Arbor and Washtenaw 
County.

City Administrator Howard 

Lazarus said the city plans to 
continue 
educating 
officials 

and move the discussion from 
the philosophy of equity to the 
implementation 
of 
equitable 

practices in Ann Arbor and 
countywide.

While Scott DeRue, dean of 

Ross School of Business, has 
flown across the globe to host 
alumni gatherings known as 
“Ross Talks,” on Thursday night 
he only had to take the elevator to 
the sixth floor of the Ross School 
of Business.

Ross Talks, all of which 

are 
moderated 
by 
DeRue, 

are designed to offer alumni, 

current students and prospective 
students a forum in which to 
network and engage with panel 
discussions. The Ann Arbor 
event is one stop on a 18-city 
lineup the Business School has 
planned for the calendar year. 

Tom Lewand, the CEO of 

Detroit-based watch company 
Shinola, joined DeRue onstage 
along with Ross senior Kiva 
McGhee 
and 
Mike 
Barger, 

executive director for the Office 
of 
Strategy 
and 
Academic 

Innovation. 
DeRue 
led 
a 

discussion centered around a 
new Business course titled Living 
Business Leadership Experience.

The course is available for 

students enrolled in both the 
B.B.A. and M.B.A. programs 
at the University and offers 
an 
opportunity 
to 
engage 

with one of the seven partner 
companies who have agreed 
to allow students to help lead a 
project. Students are split up into 
functional teams emphasizing 
e-commerce, 
supply 
chain 

management, 
marketing 
and 

finance. 

DeRue 
emphasized 
how 

the 
course 
was 
inspired 

by the school’s history of 
innovation, citing how the 
Business 
School 
pioneered 

the Multidisciplinary Action 
Project, a program in which 
M.B.A. students spend two 
months working on location 
at companies across the globe, 
two decades ago.

DeRue 
worked 
with 

Lewand, who serves on the 
Business School’s Board of 
Advisers, to brainstorm what 
a “living business” experience 
could look like.

“We were at an advisory 

board meeting and we had this 
idea,” DeRue said. “And I said to 
Tom, ‘I imagine a world where 
we actually start building 
businesses within the business 
school in partnership with 
companies where our students 
actually run the business.’”

DeRue and Leward’s initial 

idea came to fruition with 
the 
first 
Living 
Business 

Leadership Experience class 
during the Fall 2017 semester. 

Now, the course is in its second 
semester, and current projects 
extend across industries, from 
affordable housing to education 
to technology development.

McGhee was a member of the 

inaugural class last year, and she 
has re-enrolled in the course 
this semester to continue her 
assignment as a Shinola team 
lead, contributing to the rollout 
of their headphones.

“We helped set the price 

point for the headphones. So I 
think we are actually listened 
to, and they take our advice, 
and I think there is a really 
great 
relationship 
that 
we 

established,” 
McGhee 
said. 

“Especially, we have made 
changes since last semester. 
A big change is that we go 
down (to Detroit) much more 
frequently and I think it is really 
great to have that cadence and 
actually feel a part of the team.”

As a lead organizer and 

faculty member for the course, 
Barger echoed the experience 
of 
McGhee, 
sharing 
an 

observation 
he’s 
witnessed 

among students taking the 
course.

“In every single one of the 48 

ten-page papers I read over the 
Christmas holiday, there was a 
situation where (the students) 
had asked for some data or 
asked for some help from 
someone and (the company) 
hadn’t delivered the data or the 
help,” Barger said.

Every Friday, one Daily staffer will give a behind the 
scenes look at one of this week’s stories. This week, 
Public policy junior Lydia Murray wrote a column on her 
disdain for the sport of football and its culture at the 
University of Michigan.

“The inspiration for my column was just writing my worst 
opinions that I have –– just all the really unpopular opinions 
that I have. This last week, I wrote one about how I think 
football is boring and overrated, and I went through and 
detailed what I thought were some really good points, 
including the fact that it is really dangerous to its players. 
And I got a lot of hate for it. I got a lot of angry comments, 
but I think it was worth it. It was a good time. I personally 
found it really amusing that people were hating on me. I was 
laughing a lot. Especially because I wrote a line in my column 
making fun of people who would be mad at me, and they did 
it anyway. So, for me it was just really funny, but I hope the 
angry white men are okay.“

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
The challenge I face is that none of us, including the 

Greek community, want the things that are unhealthy in 
the community to continue ... On the other hand, we don’t 
want to talk about the community as though there’s 
nothing good in the community. I am both encouraged by 
their own self-monitoring in saying that we need to stop 
the social activities because of all this going on, and that 
also frightens me because my experience has been when 
we self-correct, things are sometimes more dangerous 
than we know.“

“Going forward, the sessions 

will be similar inasmuch as 
there will be a lot of large group 
instruction,” Lazarus said. “But 
we will work more on providing 
tools to deal with inequity 
and 
they 
will 
move 
from 

philosophical to more practical 
discussions.”

Washtenaw 
County 

Commissioner Felicia Brabec 
said this inequity is not a new 
issue for the community and is 
something she has been working 
on personally since the county’s 
equity summit in 2015.

“What we are doing now 

is the culmination of years of 
work of a core group of us really 
working on bringing it to our 
region in a way that is accessible 
for 
folks 
and 
gets 
people 

excited and wanting to address 
inequities and move forward 
on these things,” Brabec said. 
“Sometimes that takes a while, 
but here we are.”

Many 
officials 
agreed 

inequity has been an issue in 
Ann Arbor and Washtenaw 
County for quite some time. 
Councilmember 
Chuck 

Warpehoski, D-Ward 5, said 
there was a time when housing 
policy in Ann Arbor allowed 
deeds that restricted ownership 
of the property to Caucasians. 
While city policies today may 
seem race-neutral, Warpehoski 
said there are still policies that 
drive inequity, one of which was 
a city mobile “A2 Fix It” app 
for reporting issues to the City 

Council.

“These type of policies, while 

they do not appear inequitable, 
cause a racial and digital divide. 
Some people have less access,” 
Warpehoski said. “These things 
need to be equally accessible for 
all people.”

Amid discussion of health and 

educational inequities, Lazarus 
touched on current racial issues 
and public distrust of the Ann 
Arbor Police Department and 
the council’s consideration of 
developing a police review board 
without 
investigative 
power. 

In response to the community 
criticism of the process, Lazarus 
said the police department had 
already gone through inherent 
bias training.

“They (the initiative and the 

review board) are definitely 
related,” Lazarus said. “I think 
part of the goal of the review 
of 
the 
police 
department 

community 
engagement 

practice is to identify the areas 
where the police department 
can 
communicate 
more 

effectively, build trust with 
the community and ensure 
that the way that we police the 
community is in large part the 
way the community wants to 
be policed which revolves on 
breaking down barriers and 
better 
educational 
practices. 

Which is similar to what we are 
doing with the initiative.”

Warpehoski also argued the 

idea of a police review board 
is an ideal that aligns with the 
initiative’s goals.

“While the design of the 

police 
review 
board 
and 

whether it will have police 
members is not established and 

is still an open question, having 
structures both internally and 
externally helps solidify our 
commitment to the people,” 
Warpehoski. “I want all our 
boards considering equity.”

Lazarus, 
Brabec 
and 

Warpehoski 
all 
agreed 
on 

several 
major 
issues 
the 

initiative must address: Health, 
education and housing. Brabec 
said during the session Monday 
she was asked what success for 
the initiative would look like.

“I 
came 
up 
with 
these 

four things right off the top 
of 
my 
head,” 
Brabec 
said. 

“Diminishing 
or 
no 
health 

disparities, 
integrated 

neighborhoods, schools with 
access to the same resources 
and developed transportation.”

While the initiative is still 

in its early educational phases, 
officials say they hope to begin 
making real changes in city 
and county policy soon. The 
initiative, 
Warpehoski 
said, 

is really about the city finally 
following through on its core 
principles.

“We talk a lot about a lot 

of things in this community, 
but for me success means we 
actually roll things out that 
address the inequities that are 
very real,” Warpehoski said. “I 
would really like this to not be 
a once and done type of thing. 
I want this to be an ongoing, 
consistent part of how the city 
and the county does business. So 
that we are always challenging 
ourselves to do better when 
it comes to equity and we are 
consistently year in and year out 
finding ways to address these 
inequities.”

she said.

In response to the initial 

guide, Public Policy junior 
Lauren Schandevel organized 
her own guide titled “Being 
Not-Rich 
at 
UM” 
that 
is 

specifically tailored to lower-
income 
students, 
as 
the 

original 
guide 
was 
geared 

vaguely toward “students from 
all backgrounds.” She said 
this new document would be 
beneficial for those who found 
themselves underrepresented 
in the original.

“I would have liked to see 

more stuff about ways to make 
money on campus because I 
feel like a lot of lower income 
students rely on a steady 
income and scholarships and 
grants and work-study and 
a job, and I felt like that was 
missing in the guide,” she said.

“This is a document in 

which we can be honest about 
the 
barriers 
lower 
income 

and first-gen students face on 
this campus,” the guide reads. 
“This guide is for anyone who 
has ever felt marginalized 
on 
campus 
— 
particularly 

students who are economically 
disadvantaged, and especially 
low-income students of color, 
whose racial oppression is 
often compounded by their 
SES.”

St. Onge, one of over 70 

students with editing access 

on the newer guide, voiced her 
appreciation for the over 10 
sections and 35 pages worth 
of material. These sections 
include general categories such 
as housing and employment, 
as well as specific categories 
that include places to look for 
scholarships, 
study 
abroad 

opportunities, where to shop 
for reasonably priced groceries 
and other necessities.

“If we’re going to have a 

section that’s like upper-class 
‘how to handle your allowance’ 
kind of budgeting that isn’t 
a hugely important part of 
the guide, we really need any 
guide on affordability to start 
with and focus on resources 
that 
actually 
help 
people 

afford to be here,” St. Onge 
said. 
“Understanding 
how 

your financial aid package 
works, how you can use it to 
your benefit, what kind of 
scholarships and employment 
opportunities 
are 
available 

to you, which jobs work well 
with student schedules and 
how you can compete in this 
really intense atmosphere that 
expects you to complete all 
of these incredibly expensive 
internships and study abroad 
programs.”

At 
the 
CSG 
meeting 

Tuesday night, Vice President 
Nadine Jawad, a Ford senior, 
addressed 
the 
controversy 

surrounding the original guide 
and committed to continuing 
to work on the project as a 
whole.

“I want to hold myself 

accountable 
for 
publishing 

a guide that has made some 
students 
feel 
marginalized 

or feel that it has excluded 
a demographic of students 
who think this guide was not 
made for them,” she said. “I 
do believe that all mistakes 
come with positives and I have 
met with many people who 
disagreed with the guide, and 
because of that we have a clear 
path on how to improve.”

Jawad has been actively 

contributing to Schandevel’s 
guide 
and 
made 
plans 

to 
convene 
with 
student 

representatives 
to 
continue 

workshopping 
ideas. 
This 

revised approach pools voices 
from 
students 
who 
have 

personally used resources cited 
in the new guide while adding 
the extensive research found 
by CSG in its development of 
the first copy.

“I believe that this guide can 

be something that represents 
many different backgrounds 
and I appreciate the dedication 
people have made to addressing 
some of the issues with the 
guide,” Jawad said. “As we 
work to get another version on 
the table, I hope more people 
will attend our town halls and 
conversations 
around 
these 

issues with the visibility of the 
guide now. I would love to see 
more people engaging in the 
work we do all years so we can 
hear feedback and continue to 
improve.”

According to LSA freshman 

Juan Orozco, his transition 

into the University as a HAIL 
Scholar 
eliminated 
many 

potential stressors and made 
the 
university 
experience 

much more achievable, but he 
still faces day-to-day struggles 
of living in Ann Arbor.

“I’m a low-income student 

(and) 
coming 
into 
the 

University, I had to rely a lot 
on scholarships and funds to 
actually get here – otherwise 
I wouldn’t be able to attend, 
my family wouldn’t be able to 
handle the debt,” he said.

He referenced the Go Blue 

Guarantee, 
which 
promises 

full tuition to any in-state 
student 
with 
a 
familial 

income of $65,000 or less, as 
a milestone for students in a 
similar situation as him, both in 
ideology and implementation. 
He reaffirmed steady progress 
from the student body and 
its 
student 
government 
is 

essential to continuing to make 
the University a welcoming 
campus and a life-changing 
opportunity for all students to 
learn and flourish.

“I just feel education should 

be equitable for everyone, and 
being able to budget for low-
income students to come into 
U of M and to be able to get an 
education here, and transfer 
that to a degree, and later a 
job, to provide for themselves 
later on, I think that’s the most 
important thing,” he said.

people see as Engler’s weak 
stance on sexual assault. A 
report from Bridge Magazine, 
published by The Center for 
Michigan ––a thinktank that 
analyzes 
and 
informs 
the 

public 
on 
Michigan 
policy 

issues –– recounted Engler’s 
role in a 1990s sexual assault 
case of female prison inmates 
in which he prohibited state 
prison officials from speaking 
to lawyers and United Nations 
investigators to discover the 
scope of the women’s claims. 
In 2009, the stated settled the 
lawsuit for $100 million on 
behalf of 500 women assaulted 
by prison guards.

In anticipation of Engler’s 

appointment 
Tuesday, 
MSU 

professor Rob DeLuca issued 
a statement on behalf of the 
faculty-comprised 
MSU 

Steering 
Committee, 
calling 

for a month- to semester-
long process to appoint a new 
MSU president and strongly 
suggesting it be a woman with 
extensive academic experience. 
He 
claimed 
the 
Board 
of 

Trustees would be ignoring the 
wishes of the MSU community 
by appointing someone with 
no 
academic 
leadership 

experience.

“We 
expressed 
in 
no 

uncertain terms that appointing 
a former Governor with no 
academic leadership experience 

as interim president would not 
be the best way to heal the 
wounds 
of 
our 
community 

in this politically polarized 
climate,” the statement read. 
“The Board of Trustees seems 
to have chosen to ignore major 
stakeholders 
of 
the 
MSU 

community in their rush to 
appoint an interim president.” 

In light of the sentencing of 

Nassar, Engler assured members 
of the community he plans to 
improve MSU communication 
and transparency.

“I will move forward as if 

my own daughters were on this 
campus and will treat every 
student as I would my own 
daughters,” Engler said.

Dan Martel, president of 

MSU’s 
College 
Democrats, 

wrote a letter to the Board 
of Trustees on behalf of the 
chapter calling for a sit-in until 
they are heard.

“The appointment of former 

Gov. John Engler shows a 
clear dismissal of the concerns 
and desires of the student 
body and alumni,” the letter 
read. 
“Instead 
of 
instating 

a clear, transparent process 
for determining the interim 
president, the trustees instead 
chose 
to 
appoint 
Engler 

through 
over-the-weekend 

backroom deals. Instead of 
appointing a uniting figure 
ready to repair campus and take 
on the complex issue of sexual 
assault, the board instead chose 
to appoint a partisan figure that 
would only further divide the 
MSU community.”

“I think it’s the ability to 

critically analyze what they 
see in the sports industry, 
what they see from the outside 
as an insider, and allows them 
to see beyond the messaging 
… and think about what the 
actual plan was, what was the 
problem, what the goal in the 
product (was),” Cho said. “The 
hope is that they can think 
at a level that would provide 
value to an actual company, 
see if they can get to that level 
of thought and analysis that 
would equal or add value to the 
actual people in the industry.”

While 
not 
a 
practicing 

lawyer, Cho is a member of 
the State Bar of California 
and said his legal background 
helps him in his position at the 
University.

“It has helped me more and 

more as my career has gone 
on, particularly in my last 
role at adidas, specifically in 
Basketball Sports Marketing. 
Our global partnership with 
the NBA involved a number 
of larger partnership legal 
agreements 
and 
smaller 

agreements,” Cho said. “It 
has always helped that I can 
approach those and review 
them and finalize them with 
our actual legal team. So not 
practicing law but being able to 
bring the business context with 
an agreement to a discussion 
with our legal team as we are 
finalizing amendments.”

Cho credits his mentors at 

and beyond the University for 
providing him with crucial 
knowledge and experience in 
his industry.

“I’ve 
been 
fortunate 
to 

work with a number of terrific 
mentors 
at 
both 
brands 

who have shared all of their 
previous experience with me 
and allowed me to span a larger 
time frame than my actual time 
in the industry,” Cho said. “So 
I’ve had the fortunate ability 
to work with a number of 
20-plus year veterans at Nike 
and adidas that have shared a 
lot of their experiences with 
me in addition to the direct 
first hand experiences that 
I’ve had and it’s a combination 
of those two that have allowed 
me to get this far.”

Cho’s 
dedication 
to 
the 

University and his newfound 
love of teaching inspires him 
to provide students the same 
wisdom he received as he 
worked in the sports industry.

“I love it,” Cho said. “I 

absolutely love teaching. It’s 
something I think I’ve been 
subconsciously preparing for 
my entire time in the sports 
industry that I have only 
consciously started to think 
about and now plan for but 
it’s incredibly rewarding. For 
me, it’s giving back to the 
students that same experience 
and wisdom that my previous 
mentors and colleagues gave to 
me as I was going through the 
industry. I have no idea if I’ll 
teach another class but even 
this one opportunity is more 
than I ever hoped or expected 
for.”

Kelli 
Donahue, 
associate 

program 
chair 
and 
senior 

lecturer 
at 
the 
Sport 

Management Program, first 
met with Cho to discuss the 
possibility of a lecture.

“It’s 
very 
exciting 
to 

have 
David 
teaching 
for 

us this semester in Sport 
Management,” Donahue wrote 
in an email interview. “David’s 
career working on NBA global 
partnerships and marketing 
for adidas is one that many of 
our students hope to emulate, 
and for them to learn from 
David first hand is immensely 
valuable.”

Kinesiology senior Cameron 

Dotson 
said 
in 
an 
email 

interview he has enjoyed being 
in Cho’s course this semester. 
Dotson was a former intern at 
Under Armour where he met 
one of Cho’s early mentors. He 
said he values Cho’s previous 
experience and the lessons he 
teaches in his course.

“I think the best thing 

I have learned from David 
is the value of being a good 
person and just looking to do 
the right thing when you can. 
Through our conversations, 
as well as personal examples 
that he’s spoken on in lecture, 
it seems as though he really 
prioritizes ethical work, and 
being altruistic in a fast-paced, 
exciting 
industry,” 
Dotson 

wrote. “I think I speak for all 
of my classmates when I say 
that I hope we stay in touch in 
the future!”

violence has been revised as 
well to emphasize that the 
University believes emotional 
abuse 
is 
a 
reoccurring 

behavior and not an isolated 
incident.

In an effort to improve the 

sanctioning 
process, 
cases 

that used to be heard by a 
voluntary board of OIE and 
OSCR-trained faculty, staff 
and student representatives 
will 
now 
be 
heard 
by 

professional OSCR staff. This 
approach 
will 
reportedly 

ensure 
professionals 
with 

significant training will be 
responsible for determining 
proper sanctions.

Rackham student Kamaria 

Porter, who currently serves 
on the sanctioning board, 
wrote in an email she found 
the volunteer board to be an 

unsustainable process due to 
competing schedules and the 
large time commitment of 
case review sessions.

“Being 
on 
the 
board 

is 
a 
huge, 
unpaid 
time 

commitment,” 
Porter 

wrote. “It includes reading 
sometimes hundreds of pages, 
deliberating for hours, and 
follow up emails. In addition, 
we had an 8 hour training. 
Sometimes things come up 
and board members can’t be 
available. That model doesn’t 
seem sustainable in terms of 
securing volunteers who are 
already deeply involved in a 
professional job, serving as 
faculty, or pursuing a degree 
full time. 

Finally, 
the 
option 
of 

mediation 
between 
an 

accuser and the respondent is 
now available in cases of non-
penetrative sexual assault.

I

t has been a few months 
since the initial Twitter 
storm of #metoo, but 

women aren’t done 
speaking out. Recent 
allegations 
have 

been brought against 
Aziz Ansari, James 
Franco and others. 
Art 
museums 
are 

grappling with how 
to treat artwork by 
artists 
accused 
of 

sexual assault, which 
was discussed by The 
New York Times in 
an article about artist Chuck 
Close. (Regarding separating 
the art from the artist, a 
column in The Michigan Daily 
by Sophia Kaufman addresses 
the issue excellently).

The movement has been 

likened to a witch hunt more 
than once. Maybe it seems 
like a witch hunt because 
many 
famous, 
well-known 

men are suddenly being held 
accountable for actions that 
had previously been protected 
by a status quo; maybe it feels 
this way because far more 
people than we expected have 
been exposed. Despite years 
of discomfort and whispered 
stories about dangerous men 
with the power to exploit, it 
still comes as a shock to some 
just how prevalent this issue 
is. The number of people 
finally 
being 
called 
out 

isn’t an indication that the 
movement has gone too far — 
it means that the movement 
was (and continues to be) 
incredibly necessary.

Beyond this, there’s more to 

why “witch hunt” is such an 
inappropriate phrase. Pacific 
Standard published an article 
breaking 
down 
why 
the 

movement isn’t a witch hunt. 
Specifically, the writer talked 
about how witch hunts are, 
historically, the oppression 
or exploitation of vulnerable 
minority populations by the 
powerful. That’s not what’s 
happening here. The men in 
question are not a minority 
group; they are not being 
systematically oppressed or 
prejudiced.

NBC News published an 

article about the struggles 

of the #metoo movement in 
France. A man quoted in the 
article discussed how he felt 

he wasn’t able to 
look at or speak to 
women 
anymore 

for 
fear 
of 

crossing the line 
between seduction 
and 
sexual 

harassment. 
If 

you’re able to look 
at this movement 
and see only your 
own 
concerns 

about being able 

to flirt with strangers, you’ve 
been lucky enough to live in a 
place of privilege.

I’ve seen from multiple 

Twitter accounts, articles, 
comments on social media, 
etc., people sharing their 
confusion about supposedly 
blurry lines. “Are we even 
allowed to talk to women 
anymore?” they ask.

If you have to ask that 

question, 
the 
answer 
is 

no. 
If 
your 
manner 
of 

approaching 
unfamiliar 

women or speaking to female 
colleagues is such that you 
think someone might call it 
harassment, that’s on you. 
That’s not a result of people 
being overly sensitive — it’s 
an issue that you should’ve 
corrected long ago.

I know plenty of people 

— men and women — who 
have been able to grapple 
with 
the 
movement, 
with 

the outpouring of pain, with 
the testimonies of survivors, 
without worrying about the 
hardships that being held 
to higher standards might 
entail. I’ve had innumerable 
conversations that never even 
got close to asking, “But how 

will this make my life harder?”

This is a long overdue 

reckoning. For each man who 
has fallen from grace (see 
Harvey 
Weinstein, 
Kevin 

Spacey, Louis CK—the list 
goes on) there are numerous 
victims who suffered. They 
were taken advantage of by 
those who had the ability 
to destroy their careers and 
publicly 
humiliate 
them. 

And while there might be 
some kind of spectrum of 
aggressions, 
that 
doesn’t 

change that each experience 
is painful and traumatizing. 
We shouldn’t approach change 
slowly. It’s not enough to go 
after only the most heinous of 
abuses and shrug our shoulders 
at 
workplace 
harassment. 

Every 
act 
of 
oppression 

perpetrated must be held as 
unequivocally impermissible. 

Of course the conversations 

around 
these 
topics 
are 

tense — grappling with our 
ideas of consent and assault 
is tricky. Being forced to 
reflect on our past behavior 
can be uncomfortable. While 
it’s 
the 
responsibility 
of 

individuals to be accountable 
for their actions, there’s no 
questioning that society has 
conditioned men and women 
to approach sexuality and 
relationships 
in 
different 

ways. But discomfort doesn’t 
mean that we shouldn’t have 
the 
conversations. 
Going 

through 
the 
process 
of 

reconsidering and relearning 
what is acceptable behavior is 
not too great a price to pay.

Powerful 
individuals 

having to face consequences 
is an important step forward. 
But 
the 
movement 
isn’t 

over. As long as people are 
resisting the breakdown of 
these 
misogynistic 
norms, 

there is more work to be done. 
The answer is not to run from 
the problem for fear of what 
confronting it will reveal. We 
owe it to every person who 
has been exploited, harassed, 
oppressed or any number 
of other verbs to work for 
change together.

O

ver the past few years, 
the 
NFL 
has 
faced 

increasing 
scrutiny 

for 
its 
growing 

concussion epidemic 
and 
domestic 

violence issues, both 
serving as evidence in 
the narrative that the 
NFL is a destructive 
professional 
sports 

league.

But the NFL did 

not 
always 
have 

this reputation.

In 2001, Vince 

McMahon created the XFL 
as 
a 
hard-hitting, 
working 

man’s alternative to the NFL, 
which he saw as “a league for 
pantywaists and sissies.” 

The 
following 
year, 

Neuropathologist 
Bennet 

Omalu 
revealed 
the 

groundbreaking 
discovery 

of 
chronic 
traumatic 

encephalopathy in former NFL 
player Mike Webster’s brain. 
 

Meanwhile, the XFL sought to 
captivate fans with a rhetoric 
of violence, sex and danger 
that the NFL seemingly did 
not possess, at least not to the 
extent desired by McMahon.

Despite positive ratings in 

its first week, support for the 
league fell as sloppy football 
and unskilled players detracted 
from its initial appeal, and it 
ultimately lost an estimated 
$70 million. Now, with the NFL 
falling 17 percent in TV ratings 
over the past two seasons, 
McMahon has announced the 
return of the XFL for 2020, 
albeit with drastically different 
rules and principles.

In addition to the removal 

of 
scandalous 
cheerleaders 

and 
inauthentic 
gameplay, 

McMahon 
has 
proposed 
a 

new rule that I argue will 
undoubtedly provoke the most 
controversy — banning XFL 
players from protesting or 
kneeling during the national 
anthem. Though the NFL has 

taken steps in its progress 
because of its growing public 
perception as dangerous, it 

has proven to be an 
arena for political 
protest and freedom 
of 
expression. 
By 

taking away the right 
of players to protest, 
the XFL will detract 
from the progress 
made by the NFL in 
pushing for social 
equality — and in 
doing so will fail to 
achieve the level of 

success at which McMahon is 
aiming.

McMahon’s newly proposed 

XFL is largely a manifestation 
of 
conservative 
American 

values. In addition to banning 
player protests, McMahon has 
stated that no former criminals 
will be allowed to participate 
in the league.

In 
response 
to 
these 

new rules, reporters asked 
McMahon 
whether 
or 
not 

former 
NFL 
quarterback 

Tim Tebow would be a good 
fit for the league, to which 
McMahon replied, “he could 
very well play.” Tebow, who 
became famous for his extreme 
expressions of religious faith 
both on and off the field, 
epitomizes the type of player 
McMahon wants in the XFL — a 
clean-cut, white Christian male 
with respect for traditional 
American values of patriotism 
and law and order.

However, 
the 
NFL 
has 

departed from the narrow-
minded 
values 
praised 

by 
McMahon 
and 
Tebow, 

exemplified by quarterback 
Colin 
Kaepernick 
being 

announced as a runner-up 
for the 2017 TIME Magazine 
Person of the Year for his 
efforts 
in 
protesting 
the 

national 
anthem 
and 
the 

system of racial inequality for 
which the flag stands.

Since Kaepernick began his 

public protests, he has faced 
his fair share of criticism, 
especially 
from 
President 

Donald Trump, who declared 
he wanted to “Get that son of 
a bitch off the field right now.” 
Unsurprisingly, the president 
and the founder of the XFL 
have a shared WWE history, 
with Trump making several 
appearances on the wrestling 
show and at one point acting in 
a stunt and at another shaving 
McMahon’s head.

Though McMahon recently 

stated he has not spoken with 
Trump at all with regard to 
the new XFL rules, it would be 
naive to ignore the connection 
between the two powerful men 
and the resulting similarities in 
their values — an appreciation 
for all things American and 
a strong distaste for those 
perceived as a threat to the 
existing structure of white 
male authority, especially in the 
realm of athlete protests.

So, as the political climate of 

the NFL has gravitated more 
toward progressive attempts 
at dismantling racial prejudice 
and inequality, the XFL is 
taking a large step back by 
banning the ability for players 
to protest the national anthem. 
Aligning with the ideology of 
Trump, McMahon is putting 
himself in a group categorized 
by 
racism 
and 
closed-

mindedness, and is certainly in 
no better of a position than he 
was circa 2001.

Ultimately, 
in 
trying 
to 

advertise the new XFL as a 
modern 
alternative 
to 
the 

dying 
NFL, 
McMahon 
is 

neglecting the positive strides 
professional football players 
have 
made 
toward 
social 

equality — and it won’t be long 
before football fans across the 
country realize what values the 
XFL truly stands for.

The XFL will not succeed

FROM THE DAILY

L

ast week, University of Michigan’s Central Student Government 
unveiled the latest in a series of controversial proposals this school 
year. Their Campus Affordability Guide sparked a fierce backlash from 

students for providing advice that was deeply irresponsible, negligent and out 
of touch. The guide, which has since been taken down and is in the process 
of being remade, reveals the larger problem within CSG: the lack of true 
representation of the student body.

The 
Affordability 
Guide 

had the purpose of supporting 
students, but, while with good 
intentions, it greatly missed 
the mark by including tips that 
were incompatible with the 
reality of being a student of 
low socioeconomic status. One 
tip included the suggestion 
that students pay off their 
credit card debt with another 
credit card. This is reckless 
advice that could lead to more 
financial difficulties and is 
highly discouraged by banking 
services 
such 
as 
Discover 

Bank. Other advice seemed to 
come from a place of outright 
privilege, 
exhibiting 
just 

how removed from campus 
life they were by issuing out 
“budgeting” tips such as firing 
one’s gardener or to stop using 
a laundry service.

While the guide offered 

some very useful information 
on using campus resources, 
much of it was overshadowed 
by the condescension of the 
problematic 
sections. 
The 

guide could have been an 
effective resource for students, 
but soon after its release, the 
out-of-touch sections and tone 
robbed it of any legitimacy.

Instead of prioritizing the 

quality of the information they 
provided, the authors seemed 
to have aimed to create a 
daunting, 84-page document. 
The lost time and effort in 
creating a visually impressive 
guide could have been spent 
on 
any 
number 
of 
other 

beneficial CSG programs or, 
more pertinently, on refining 
the information in the original 
product.

The tone and information in 

the CSG Affordability Guide 
is also indicative of a larger 
institutional 
problem: 
the 

body’s lack of diversity. CSG’s 
problem with diversity is well 
documented 
in 
their 
own 

2016-2017 Diversity Report. 
The information shows the 
organization is not reflective 
of the University’s population 
demographics, 
especially 

in the socioeconomic status 
category. 
Over 
35 
percent 

of CSG members come from 
a household income of over 
$250,000, 
whereas 
the 

median family income at the 
University is $154,000.

The 
evidence 
of 
the 

problems that arise when a 
group is overly homogenous is 
clear in the out-of-touch advice 
given 
in 
the 
Affordability 

Guide. The CSG environment 
runs the risk of becoming an 
echo chamber in which ideas, 
while good intentioned, are 
not evaluated in a way that 
ensures all of their projects 
will be substantially adding 
to the welfare of the students 
they represent.

An 
easy 
way 
to 
avoid 

similar 
problems 
from 

arising in the near future is 
by actively seeking out the 
help of students who come 
from different backgrounds 
in every step of a project’s 
process, including analyzing 
the finished product before 
publishing it. In a recent 
Facebook 
post, 
CSG 
Vice 

President Nadine Jawad, the 
director of the guide, wrote 
CSG 
was 
“taking 
student 

concerns and criticisms to 
the 
guide 
very 
seriously” 

in the process of recreating 
the guide. She also shared 
the opportunity for students 
to voice their concerns at a 
discussion Monday night. This 
is a step in the right direction 
to ensure that resources for 
students are created with all 
students in mind. However, 
on a more long-term scale, 
CSG needs to confront their 
problems with homogeny and 
find ways to make membership 
easier and more appealing to 
students of low socioeconomic 
status.

In its current state, CSG is 

perceived as an organization 
with 
a 
revolving 
door 
of 

members who put enormous 
effort 
into 
gaining 
the 

position but end up dropping 
the ball on the projects they 
start. This results in members 
serving 
their 
tenure 
and 

leaving 
without 
creating 

much lasting change. While 

there is no doubt that the 
endeavors they undertake are 
worthwhile and come from a 
place of kindness and support, 
the picture they have painted 
of themselves recently is that 
of a student group whose 
members 
prioritize 
their 

position in the organization as 
a résumé builder rather than 
their service to the University 
community. If efforts aren’t 
taken to rectify the perception 
of 
CSG 
in 
the 
upcoming 

semester, 
they 
could 
lose 

credibility with the students, 
which, as a representative 
body, 
will 
significantly 

decrease the clout they need in 
pursuing any future projects.

But all is not lost. With 

CSG elections on the horizon, 
there is room for change and 
improvement. We hope the 
upcoming candidates, when 
choosing their party, make 
a notable effort to include 
students of all backgrounds 
on their ticket. This will 
require the new candidates to 
be cognizant of the barriers 
to running for CSG that many 
low socioeconomic students 
will face, including the time 
commitment 
and 
campaign 

fees that some parties request 
from their members. We ask 
for candidates to accommodate 
students who may not be able to 
dedicate as much to the party 
as others due to these external 
factors. 
Oftentimes, 
these 

students’ voices are the most 
reflective of the experience of 
the majority on campus.

CSG 
is 
a 
powerful 

organization 
with 
the 

resources 
to 
make 
lasting 

change 
on 
the 
student 

experience at the University. 
It would be of great service 
to the University community 
if they would take effort to 
confront the problems within 
their institution, which have 
caused 
the 
recent 
string 

of unpopular projects, and 
prioritize 
rectifying 
these 

issues in the near future.

One of the most remembered 
records by the unparalleled 
Pavement, 
Brighten 
the 
Corners, is turning the big 2-1 
on Feb. 11. Amid the rise of 
teen idol pop bands like the 
Backstreet Boys and the Spice 
Girls, the four college students 
that 
made 
up 
Pavement 
were 
recording 
music 
in 
their friend’s basements in 
Stockton, Calif. and releasing 
lo-fi, melodic, raw-bone noise 
into the world
After 
releasing 
three 
records full of unexpected 
reverb and scratchy guitar 
strums, Pavement perfected a 
blend of classic rock and West 
Coast underground sounds on 
Brighten the Corners. I’ll name a 
few things you should listen to 
this week to celebrate Brighten 
the 
Corners’s 
influence 
on 
modern music of all types, 
from art pop and indie rock to 
lo-fi bedroom shoegaze.
The two introductory tracks 
on Brighten the Corners and 
two of the most well-known 
Pavement 
songs, 
“Stereo” 
and “Shady Lane,” epitomize 
the band’s ability to combine 
steady drum beats with deep 
bass hits and shaky guitar 
riffs. In each song, Stephen 
Malkmus’s double-edged voice 
spills wit into a rhythmic 
atmosphere. 
The 
resulting 
quick 
but 
relaxed 
groovy 
pace for the rest of the record 
creates 
a 
rooted 
balance 
between swift punk clashes 
and smooth rock ‘n’ roll tunes.
The 
diverse 
sound 
of 
Pavement’s music stems from 

their deep pool of sometimes 
unrelated 
influences 
that 
deserve just as much attention 
when remembering Brighten 
the 
Corners. 
In 
“Perfect 
Sound Forever: The Story of 
Pavement” by Rob Jovanovic, 
there is a list of albums and 

artists that each band member 
pinpointed 
Pavement’s 
creation on. The list jumps 
from the art rock sounds of 
The Velvet Underground to the 
ambient noises of Faust.
The shallow bass strums on 
Brighten the Corners bring us 
back to the sounds found in 
the song “A Can of Lemonade” 
off the album Remorse Code 

by The Desperate Bicycles. 
In the song “Walking Talking 
Channel,” Malkmus’s distinct 
vocals that hop with guitar 
hits 
are 
found 
in 
Danny 
Wigley’s jumpy and crooning 
voice. Remorse Code’s fuzzy 
and guttural guitar sounds 
were ahead of their time with 
its 1979 release, handing the 
world endless possibilities of 
exploration with the do-it-
yourself attitude.
Pavement 
was 
also 
influenced 
by 
one 
of 
my 
personal favorite records, Pink 
Flag by Wire. Pink Flag is full 
of chunky bass-lines, weepy 
vocals 
and 
heavy 
reverbs. 
The songs “Strange” and the 
record’s title track hit all of the 
right spots in your eardrums 
and commands your body to 
move with the drums, creating 
an experience that Pavement’s 
“We Are Underused” instills 
in listeners.
Other honorable mentions 
that made Pavement who they 
were, and that also made music 
what it is and what it can be, 
are (of course) “Rise Above” 
from Black Flag’s Damaged, “I 
Dreamed I Dream” from Sonic 
Youth’s Daydream Nation and 
“Dreams Never End” from 
New Order’s Movement.
Each 
of 
these 
songs 
showcases 
how 
broad 
the 
spectrum can reach in the 
worlds of lo-fi, punk and rock, 
and how each band’s distinct 
sounds 
can 
be 
borrowed 
and crafted into something 
like 
Brighten 
the 
Corners. 
At its release, Brighten the 
Corners was incredibly fresh, 
delivering individual sounds 
with honest lyrics, and now, it 
takes its own place on the list 
of eternal influential records.

21 to ‘Brighten the Corners’

‘Please Stand By’ lacks 
in its portrayal of autism

FILM REVIEW

MAGNOLIA PICTURES 

This past year, there have 
been many attempts to give 
proper 
representation 
to 
characters 
on 
the 
autism 
spectrum. “The Good Doctor,” 
starring 
Freddie 
Highmore 
(“Bates 
Motel”), 
found 
a 
receptive audience with its 
portrayal of a young surgeon 
on the spectrum. Highmore’s 
dedicated 
performance 
as 
Shaun Murphy earned him 
a Golden Globe nomination. 
On the other hand, Netflix’s 
“Atypical” 
received 
mixed 
reviews for its treatment of 
the sensitive subject. Keir 
Gilchrist 
(“It 
Follows”) 
wrongly 
transforms 
the 
emotional trials of a person 
with 
autism 
into 
a 
cold 
impression, 
disappointing 
fans with his characterization 
of a depressed teen akin to his 
performance in “It’s Kind of 
a Funny Story.” Add “Please 
Stand By” to the list of earnest 
attempts to destigmatize this 
mental condition in media. 
Unfortunately, like “Atypical,” 
“Please Stand By” lacks the 
caliber of a nuanced actor or 
quality script to succeed.
Wendy 
(Dakota 
Fanning, 
“Brimstone”), a young woman 

on the spectrum, lives in a 
group home. When she hears 
about 
a 
Star 
Trek 
script 
contest, 
she 
eagerly 
goes 
to work writing her own 
installment. She has a rigid 
schedule to help her through 
the day, including shifts at 
a 
nearby 
Cinnabon. 
Soon, 
the 
submission 
deadline 
arrives, but Wendy fails to 

deliver her script to the post 
office on time. In order to 
get her script to Los Angeles, 
Wendy must leave her group 
home and reliable schedule 
to embark on an adventure. 
Along the way, with only her 
429-page screenplay and pet 
Chihuahua for company, she 
meets some helpful and not so 
helpful people. Through her 
dedication, she hopes to show 
her older sister Audrey (Alice 
Eve, “Before We Go”) that she 
can be trusted to return home 
despite her past outbursts.
For a story that focuses on a 
character with an internalized 
condition, the lead actor must 
carry the film. Dakota Fanning 
gives her best effort but falls 
short. Sometimes, when bad 

actors 
portray 
characters 
with neurological disorders, 
the result is catastrophically 
offensive. Thankfully, Fanning 
avoids this fate through her 
earnest approach to Wendy. 
However, if it weren’t for her 
wide-eyed 
innocent 
look, 
Fanning’s performance would 
be an utter flop. She lacks 
the depth to really explore 
Wendy’s need to share her 
creative work or her struggles 
and the lackluster script does 
not help. Instead, a strong 
supporting 
cast 
bears 
the 
brunt of the heavy lifting.
The 
always 
spectacular 
Toni 
Collette 
(“The 
Way, 
Way Back”) adds warmth and 
thoughtfulness to her role as 
Wendy’s psychologist Scottie. 
Collette steals the spotlight in 
every scene, overshadowing 
the litany of plot holes and 
unresolved 
plotlines. 
Tony 
Revolori 
(“Dope”), 
playing 
Nemo, 
Wendy’s 
coworker 
at the Cinnabon, provides 
humor. His cheeky lines and 
energy 
upstage 
Fanning’s 
blank, deadpan look. However, 
the 
standing 
ovation 
goes 
to Wendy’s Chihuahua Pete 
and 
his 
perfectly 
timed, 
judgemental faces. The fact 
that the dog is the highlight 
of the film goes to show the 
mediocrity of “Please Stand 
By.”

‘Dirty Money’ documents 
the dark corporate world

TV REVIEW

NETFLIX 

Poisoned air. Drug cartels. A 
maple syrup heist. All of these 
equally 
heinous 
crimes 
and 

more are explored and exposed 
in Netflix’s latest docuseries, 
“Dirty Money.”
Produced by Oscar-winning 
documentarian 
Alex 
Gibney 
(“Going Clear: Scientology and 
the Prison of Belief”), “Dirty 

Money” is an in-depth and 
artistic look into the corporate 
greed and corruption that gave 
birth to some of the business 
world’s 
biggest 
scandals. 
It 
employs six different directors 
for six hour-long episodes, each 

Brighten the 

Corners was 

incredibly 

fresh, delivering 

individual 

sounds with 

honest lyrics, 

and now, it 

takes its own 

place on the 

list of eternal

records

SAMANTHA DELLA FERA
Daily Arts Writer

one 
stocked 
with 
sickening 
facts and first-hand accounts 
of exactly how far some people 
and corporations will go to turn 
a profit.
The series opens with “Hard 
NOx,” a look into the inner-

workings and manipulations that 
perpetuated Volkswagen’s diesel 
emissions scam. The German 
car company claimed to be 
producing a car that would help 
reduce the release of harmful 
emissions. Instead, Volkswagen 
cars actually contributed up to 
50 percent more than the average 
vehicle to emission levels. The 
company was able to lie to 
consumers by installing a device 
in cars that essentially allowed 
them to cheat on emission tests.
Though disgusting and cruel, 
this topic is admittedly not 
the most engaging. Yet Gibney 

uses his exemplary directing to 
turn a complicated and twisted 

scandal into something no one 
can peel their eyes away from. 
Most effective is his ability 
to personalize the storyline 
— Gibney himself bought a 
Volkswagen and was proud to 
be taking a step towards helping 
the environment. That is, of 
course, until news of the diesel 
scam broke. Gibney is visibly 
infuriated 
and 
claims 
that 
his wife was ready to “take a 
chainsaw to the dealership” (cue 
an episode highlight in which 
Gibney’s wife absolutely roasts 
a Volkswagen salesman. He will 
never recover.).
Things 
do 
get 
a 
bit 
sensationalized, 
as 
any 
documentary must be in order to 
engage viewers. Gibney recalls 
Volkswagen’s beginning as a 
Nazi project, and circles back to 
this point in order to enhance the 
malicious image he is attempting 
to accent. It is an effective 
strategy, and one that is rooted 
in fact. Still, the comparison 
reaches a questionable point 
when 
Volkswagen’s 
fumes 
were paralleled with “gassing.” 
Despite the at-times extreme 
measures taken to stress its 
message, “Hard NOx” remains 
an episode that is equal parts 
educational as it is engaging and 
infuriating.
The remaining five episodes 
follow a similar formula, with 
each new director adding a 
personal touch. Topics vary 
but the core moral persists: 
Corporations care more about 
money 
than 
they 
do 
their 
consumers, and the government 
is helping them despite this fact. 

The costs of a successful business 
vary — in “Hard NOx,” it comes at 
the expense of the environment, 
and in “Drug Short,” that cost is 
someone’s life.
Yet “Dirty Money” does not 
only concern itself with the most 
high-profile cases. “The Maple 
Syrup Heist” follows a storyline 
that is pretty self-explanatory, 
and not as silly as it sounds. 
Each 
episode 
highlights 
an 
aspect of the corporate world 
that is evil — be it ties with 
terrorist organizations or the 
legal loopholes used to trick 
consumers.
The series is by no means 
anti-capitalist 
propaganda. 
Rather, it effectively highlights 
the 
issues 
that 
a 
strictly 
capitalist society sustains in 
order to begin the conversation 
on proper reform. Should the 
government care more for 
corporations or consumers? 
How 
much 
regulation 
is 
too much? How much is not 
enough? Do we have a moral 

responsibility 
to 
expect 
more 
from 
the 
businesses 
we buy from? In this post-
Citizens United era, these are 
important questions that need 
to be asked, and “Dirty Money” 
is not holding back.

FILM

“Three Billboards Outside 
Ebbing, Missouri” is the latest in 
the recent trend of movies that 
bathe themselves in nihilism 
to the point of becoming a joke. 
“Three Billboards” is one of 
those movies. It is so depressing, 
so filled with anger and hate 
and death and destruction that 
one wonders what the point of 
it all is, or perhaps what the 
point of watching the movie is. 
It’s well-produced, well-acted 
and competently directed, but 
the picture tries too hard to 
be important and forgets to 
actually tell a compelling story.
To be sure, there is an 
interesting premise at the heart 
of “Three Billboards,” but it 
is one that is stretched thinly 
over the film’s tediously long 
running time. The main story 
runs out of steam somewhere 
around the 70-minute mark and 
never recovers. There’s only so 
much you can do with a premise 
in which the answers to the 
film’s central questions are 
known to not exist almost from 
the first frame of the film.
Much has been made about 
how the movie deals with issues 
of class and race. Your opinion 
may vary but many may find it 
hard to root for the racist cop 
we hear has tortured people and 
whom we watch throw a man 
through a second story window 
of a building. The film attempts 
to turn this character into an 
antihero or at least someone we 
should root for later on, but for 
many audience members, it may 
be a difficult reach. The movie 
already asks us to continue 
rooting for Mildred even after 
she blows up an entire police 
station, something that is barely 
addressed in the rest of the film.
“Three 
Billboards” 
was 
advertised 
as 
a 
Cohen 
brothers-y 
or 
Tarintino-like 
action comedy, yet the movie 
is nothing like that at all. The 
film has some of the most 
unlikeable 
protagonists 
that 
were put on screen this year, 
and we’re not really given a 
good enough reason to care 
about them. The initial violence 
at the heart of the story is offset 
by more violent actions across 
the board to the point where 
the film is so awash in horrible 
things happening to various 
people that the viewer begins 
to become detached from the 
actual story, and eventually 
ceases to care.
Some 
people 
might 
like 
movies that offer no hope 
throughout 
their 
entire 
runtime. Others will not. The 
world we are in is dark enough as 
it is without our movies needing 
to also be dark and depressing 
Missourian 
wastelands 
in 
crisis. The film never tries to 
get into the deeper complexities 
of why the town itself barely 
cares 
about 
the 
atrocities 
committed, or why a new Black 
sheriff doesn’t seem concerned 
by the horrible crimes the 
police force perpetrated before 
he got there. It’s a shock-and-
awe film, smaller in scale than 
the superhero blockbusters that 
fill multiplexes in the summer, 
but no more intelligent. 

— Ian Harris, 
Managing Video Editor

“Three 
Billboards 
Outside 
Ebbing, Missouri” is a raw, 
emotional tidal wave of a film 
that offers one of the most 
brutally honest depictions of 
grief to ever reach the big screen. 
Frances 
McDormand 
(“Hail, 
Caesar!”) gives the performance 
of a lifetime as Mildred Hayes, a 
woman tormented by a mixture 
of guilt and seething rage at 
the world that has taken her 
daughter from her. McDormand 
communicates Mildred’s pain 
so effectively that it seems 
to permeate her every word 
and action, from her sarcastic 
remarks to her biting vulgarity. 
In Mildred, we see a woman who 
has coped with the indescribable 
pain of loss by becoming tough 

and callous, a veneer that falls 
away only a few times throughout 
the film to reveal just how much 
she longs to have her daughter 
back. 
One of the film’s hallmarks 
is its focus on dichotomy. At 
times devastatingly tragic and 
at others laugh-out-loud funny, 
occasionally at the same time, the 
film’s performances serve as the 
cornerstone to bring audiences 
on the same emotional journey as 
the characters. Each character in 
the film is granted an extensive 
emotional range to explore, and 
it’s that same extensive array 
that makes the film so impactful; 
the tone shifts from serious to 
hilarious to tragic in a matter of 
minutes, but this juxtaposition 
never feels unnatural. In fact, 
it’s that very oscillation between 
emotional extremes that allows 
the film to depict the volatility 
of grief with such keen accuracy. 
“Three Billboards” knows that 
emotions are never cleanly tied 
with a bow; Mildred’s loss shows 
us that sadness is seldom just 
sadness, and Willoughby’s idyllic 
final day with his family shows 
us that joy is seldom just joy. It’s 
these conflicts that arise from 
the characters’ own emotions 
– coupled with the cast’s adept 
ability to portray them – that 
make the film so intensely human. 
“Three Billboards” seems like 
a film that would deliver a brutal, 
pessimistic view of humanity. 
The film is steeped in tragedy and 
shows people at their absolute 
worst, 
desperately 
clawing 
after love or power or control in 
whatever way they can. In spite 
of that, however, it never fails to 
come through to show people at 
their best, with their incredible 
capacity for kindness, empathy 
and ultimately, redemption. It’s 
a film that shows human nature 
for all that it is, and is one of the 
greatest films to come out in this 
decade. 

— Max Michalsky, 
Daily Arts Writer

“Three 
Billboards” 
is 
entertaining 
because 
it 
is 
ridiculous, which, I’m certain, 
is not what the filmmakers 
intended. If the objective is to 
convince an unassuming audience 
in less than two hours that 
people are selfish and evil, then 
the movie is indeed a smashing 
success. But if humanity is meant 
to be portrayed with any sense 
of subtlety or subtext, “Three 
Billboards” fails tragically on all 
accounts.
Perhaps “tragic” is the key 
word here, since the film is so 
preoccupied with shoving every 
imaginable tragedy down the 
throat of its audience. It collects 
just about all the Oscar-worthy 
buzzwords: rape, murder, suicide, 
homophobia, 
racism, 
police 
brutality, 
domestic 
violence, 
arson, depression, alcoholism, 
disability and misogyny, just 
to name a few. And if that isn’t 
enough, the script throws in a 
half-baked 
monologue 
about 
the Catholic Church for good 
measure. Surely, you must be 
feeling something now, right?
And then there’s the flashback 
scene, which is, in one word, 
infuriating. Just before the film 
goes 
into 
completely 
insane 
territory, from where there is no 
return, a standalone flashback is 
tucked into the otherwise linear 
story for the singular purpose of 
throwing another punch. And 
even though it’s supposed to hurt, 
it doesn’t even break the skin. In 
the only scene where we see her 
raped and murdered teenage 
daughter, 
Mildred 
(Frances 
McDormand, 
“Hail, 
Caesar!”) 
passionately yells, “I hope you 

get raped!” as she watches her 
daughter barge out the door in a 
way all strong-headed teenage 
girls supposedly do. Frankly, 
the flashback is insulting. Not 
only is the writing inorganic and 
reduces 
the 
mother-daughter 
relationship to a stereotypical 
caricature of petty drama, it 
presents a source of guilt for 
Mildred 
that 
is 
completely 
unnecessary and unrelated to the 
rest of the narrative. Isn’t losing 
a child enough? Clearly, “Three 
Billboards” follows the “more the 
merrier” approach to suffocating 
its audience.
On one point, I will concede: 
Across the board, the acting is 
superb. Frances McDormand is 
nothing short of fantastic and her 
supporting cast delivers exquisite 
performances that are indeed 
worthy of Oscar nominations. 
The meat of the film, however, 
lacks any sort of nuance, and 
therefore the film will meet its 
fate as “that sad Oscar film” in the 
not too distant future. All show 
and no follow-through, “Three 
Billboards” fails to say anything 
profound at all, even though it 
tries really, really hard.

Irreconcilable Differences:
debating ‘Three Billboards 
Outside Ebbing, Missouri’

COMMUNITY CULTURE
Bennett, Hirshfield and 
simply stunning writing

One of my favorite events to 
attend on campus has always 
been the Helen Zell Visiting 
Writers Series. So when I made 
my way over to the University 
of Michigan Museum of Art 
to hear Brit Bennett and Jane 
Hirshfield read their work, I 
had high expectations.
The 
writers 
did 
not 
disappoint. Held under the 
soothing lights of the Helmut 
Stern Auditorium, Brit Bennett 
and Jane Hirshfield delivered 
readings filled with genuine 
emotion and gorgeous writing.
Bennett received her MFA 
from the University. The last 
time she did a reading at that 
podium was when she read an 
early draft of “The Mothers.” 
On Thursday, she read from 
the final draft of the book, now 
a New York Times bestselling 
novel and set to be adapted 
into a film by Warner Brothers, 
with Kerry Washington as the 
producer.
Her prose was simple but 
moving. 
Reading 
from 
the 
middle of her novel, Bennett 
took us through the lives of her 
characters, Luke and Aubrey, 
after their friend Nadia leaves 
town to attend college. Nadia’s 
mother 
recently 
committed 
suicide and Nadia dates Luke, 
an ex-football player suffering 
from an injury. Nadia’s God-
fearing friend Aubrey meets 
Luke 
during 
his 
physical 
therapy, while Nadia is at the 
University of Michigan. Though 
I haven’t read her novel, I was 
completely immersed in the 
story after two sentences.
Bennett’s success with “The 
Mothers,” her debut novel, 
served 
as 
an 
inspirational 

moment for me and the many 
aspiring authors in the audience. 
Bennett’s lyrical writing is 
impressive yet effortless, and 

each sentence is packed with 
momentum: “So even though 
we hadn’t known where she’d 
come from, we’d understood 
why Aubrey Evans couldn’t stop 
crying when the pastor asked 
what gift she’d come forward 
to receive and what she’d 
whispered, salvation.”
I’m still wondering what 
happens to Nadia, Luke and 
Aubrey. If you’re looking for 
something new to keep you up 
at night, then Bennett’s novel 
may be the answer.
Jane Hirshfield, author of 
eight collections of poetry, 
also delivered an eloquent and 
uplifting reading. She stopped 
and took the time to talk 
through some of her concerns, 
ranging from politics to the 

environment to the everyday 
problems we face.
“One 
of 
the 
ways 
of 
navigating differences is being 
permeable to them. Walls don’t 
work,” she said.
Hirshfield’s 
poetry 
is 
a 
meditation 
on 
humanity. 
Though her poems initially 
seemed 
simple 
to 
me, 
looking back at them left me 
with 
questions 
and 
many 
interpretations. 
“Let 
the 
envious gods take back what 
they can,” from her poem “Each 
Moment a White Bull Steps 
Shining into the World,” is 
particularly chilling, and I can’t 
help but wonder who exactly 
Hirshfield is thinking about.
She 
talked 
about 
the 
background 
of 
her 
poem 
“Washing Doorknobs,” which 
appeared in The New Yorker 
in Oct. of 2010, explaining 
how every New Year’s Eve she 
thoroughly cleans her house, 
polishing each doorknob before 
ringing in the new year.
“Sometimes I go out and 
party too,” she said, jokingly.
Throughout her reading, it 
became clear that Hirshfield 
is an incredibly compassionate 
and gentle person, and finds 
herself 
deeply 
affected 
by societal issues such as 
environmental 
disasters. 
Many people in the audience 
hummed in agreement with her, 
appreciative of the opportunity 
to hear a discussion on these 
problems.
It’s always nice to see the 
growth of writers, and pairing 
Bennett with Hirshfield showed 
how far an author can progress 
with their initial passion for 
writing. 
Both 
Bennett 
and 
Hirshfield kicked off the series 
this semester on a high note, 
and I’m looking forward to 
seeing what comes next.

Behind Enemy Lines: Minnesota’s Jordan Murphy and Nate Mason

Michigan 
fans 
don’t 

particularly 
like 
Minnesota 

point guard Nate 
Mason.

After 
a 

near-double-
double 
and 

20-point outing 
in 
the 
Golden 

Gophers’ 
two 

games 
against 

the 
Wolverines 

last 
season, 

the 
resentment 

makes sense.

But when Mason took Big Ten 

first-team honors over Derrick 
Walton Jr. for the 2016-17 
season, the indignation reached 
another level.

After all was said and done, 

though, it was Michigan that got 
the last laugh. The Wolverines 
were catapulted to the Sweet 
Sixteen because of Walton’s 
elite play, while Mason and 
Minnesota suffered a first round 
upset to Middle Tennessee State.

Forward 
Jordan 
Murphy 

wasn’t discussed as much as 
Mason, but he still had his way 
against Michigan last year. In 
the first contest, especially, 
Murphy wiped the floor with the 
Wolverines, notching 16 points 
and 15 rebounds in an overtime 
victory.

The 2017-18 season has been 

a flipped script for the Golden 
Gophers (3-8 Big Ten, 14-10 
overall). Dealing with the loss 
of three key players, Minnesota 
is positioned at the bottom of 
the Big Ten standings. Golden 
Gophers will need more frequent 
All-American performances by 
Murphy and Mason to maintain 
a thread of hope to resurrect an 
already-disappointing season.

The Daily sat down with 

Murphy and Mason at Big Ten 
Media Day in October to talk 
about battling depth issues, 

their lack of roster turnover and 
what their expectations for the 
season were.

The Michigan Daily: The 

team didn’t face a lot of roster 

turnover 
from 

last year. What 
improvements 
are you hoping to 
see this season? 
Have 
any 
of 

them 
been 
on 

display after the 
offseason?

Jordan 

Murphy: 
Building off the 
chemistry 
we 

had last year is one of the biggest 
things I was looking forward to. 
Really one of my goals. We do a 

good job of hanging out off the 
court to build that chemistry. 
Just staying connected with 
each other, whether that’s a 
group chat or just talking. It’s 
one of the most 
important things 
that we’ve done.

Nate Mason: 

We’re definitely 
a 
little 
more 

connected. 
Our 

chemistry 
is 

there. But we’ve 
still 
got 
two, 

three new guys 
that we need to 
rely on to help us 
out. Isaiah Washington, Jamir 
Harris, 
Davonte 
Fitzgerald. 

Those are three new guys that 

are gonna play this year. We 
gotta get them on the same page. 
It’s gonna take a while, but it’s 
better now than before it’s too 
late.

TMD: Before 

the season even 
began, the team 
lost Eric Curry 
for 
the 
year 

because 
of 
an 

ACL tear. How 
do you plan on 
making up for 
that loss?

JM: 
We’re 

trying 
guys 

at 
different 

positions. We’re getting Davonte 
ready for when he’s ready to go 
full contact. Mixing it up a bit 

with the big men. Having guys 
step up in that position, knowing 
that there are rebounds to get, 
there are points and minutes 
to be had. Making sure guys 
understand that 
and making sure 
they step up is 
the biggest thing.

NM: 
Eric 

was 
a 
very 

good 
player 

for 
us 
coming 

off 
the 
bench 

last 
year. 
He 

primarily backed 
up 
Murphy. 

But 
we’ve 
got 

Davonte Fitzgerald. He’s gonna 
come in and take that spot. He’s 
getting healthy and he’s gonna 

be good. It’s just a matter of 
being healthy and being in sync. 
Also gotta keep Murphy out of 
foul trouble.

TMD: 
Winning 
eight 
of 

your 
last 
nine 

games 
last 

season propelled 
Minnesota 
to 
the 
NCAA 

Tournament. 
What was going 
well during that 
stretch 
that 

you 
think 
can 

continue 
into 

this season?

JM: 
Guys 

started 
to 
understand 
their 

roles more. As to the rest of the 
season, the guys started to really 
find their niches inside of their 
lineups. We started making good 
lineups that meshed well with 
each other. Guys started to get in 
the gym more and work harder 
and harder as it got towards the 
end of the season.

NM: I mean, it was just a will. 

We sat down as a team, had a 
team meeting, a players-only 
meeting. We just discussed the 
will. We put it out there and 
we wanted to fix it. We were 
focused, locked in and that was 
it.

TMD: Minnesota is projected 

to finish top three in the Big 
Ten standings this year. What 
are your expectations for the 
season?

JM: Our goal is always gonna 

be a Big Ten title. That’s the first 
thing on our mind. Always gotta 
think about the big goals that we 
have for our team and that’s the 
main thing: a Big Ten title. 

NM: We want to win the Big 

Ten title. That’s our goal: we 
want a Big Ten title. We’ve got a 
chance to do it, and the only thing 
that can stop us is ourselves. 
This is the most talented team 
I’ve ever been around, it’s crazy. 
If we pull all together and play 
as one, we have a chance.

Michigan set to face struggling Golden Gophers

To say that things aren’t going 

as planned for Minnesota would 
be an understatement.

Slated 
as 
the 
preseason 

consensus No. 3 team in the Big 
Ten, the Golden Gophers (3-8 
Big Ten, 14-10 overall) currently 
sit tied for 11th place in the 
conference standings with just 
seven games remaining. Their 10 
losses are as many as they had all 
of last season.

Minnesota’s plunge to bottom-

dweller status is largely a result of 
the roster hits it has taken — most 
notably center Reggie Lynch, 
who is under investigation by 
the university for multiple sexual 
assault allegations. Lynch was last 
season’s Big Ten Defensive Player 
of the Year, and without him, the 
Golden Gophers sit second to 
last in the conference in scoring 
defense.

Minnesota has also suffered 

from the absences of starting 
shooting guard Amir Coffey 

— who is day-to-day with a 
recurring shoulder injury — and 
sixth man Eric Curry with an 
ACL tear. Coffey played over 33 
minutes per game last season as 
the team’s best finisher, while 
Curry notched nearly 20 minutes 
per game as the team’s sixth man.

Amid injury and controversy in 

a disappointing year, the Golden 
Gophers enter Crisler Center on 
Saturday on a four-game losing 
streak and with little to play for 
except pride. A victory on the road 
over No. 24 Michigan (7-4, 18-6), 
though, would be significant for 
Minnesota.

Enduring what looks like a lost 

season, Minnesota coach Richard 
Pitino now views each tough 
game as an opportunity to flatten 
the learning curve.

“I equate it to when Nate 

(Mason), Dupree (McBrayer) and 
(Jordan Murphy) two years ago 
were in the game,” Pitino said on 
Jan. 18. “And as painful as it was 
at times, it was helpful to them in 
their growth.”

Despite Minnesota’s struggles, 

it’s been Murphy — not the 
bench or newcomers — who 
has picked up the most slack. 
The junior forward is having 
a banner year, averaging 17.7 
points, 11.9 rebounds, a block and 
a steal per game. Without Lynch, 
Murphy has spearheaded an 
impressive rebounding effort — 
the Golden Gophers are second 
in the conference in offensive 
rebounding and third in defensive 
rebounding.

And if Michigan coach John 

Beilein loves anything about 
his team, it’s how it keeps 
opponents off the glass. While 
the Wolverines don’t grab many 
offensive boards themselves — 
they’re last in the conference — 
they boast the highest defensive 
rebounding percentage in the Big 
Ten. 

“There’s one thing I care about 

on the glass: Don’t let them get 
offensive rebounds,” Beilein said 
on Jan. 12. “That’s all it is. You 
see numbers, (but) the number is 
what’s the percentage of offensive 
rebounds they got. And we’re one 

of the better ones in the country at 
not allowing offensive rebounds. 
… I don’t care about how many 
rebounds they get, we’re like No. 
1 in defensive transition. You’ve 
gotta pick your poison there.”

Added 
senior 
guard 

Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman 
after Monday’s game: “I like how 
gritty we were on the boards. 
Everybody was crashing the 
boards on (Northwestern), and 
we held them to seven offensive 
rebounds. Any time you can limit 
teams to less than 10, you’re gonna 
win the game.”

For a Michigan offense that 

has scored 27 points or less in 
the first half in four of its last five 
games, controlling the glass and 
exploiting one of the conference’s 
weakest defenses could likely 
foretell the final outcome.

With a chance to add one 

bright spot to its gloomy season, 
Minnesota will have to exceed 
expectations and rebound in 
more ways than one. Against the 
Wolverines, that opportunity may 
be hard to come by.

Collapse

With 0.03 seconds left on 

the clock, the score was tied 
at 72-72 in the annual “Pink 
Game” to honor breast cancer 
survivors.

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team had one last 
chance to take the victory 
against Purdue and expand on 
its six-game winning streak. 
The clock ticked down, as 
the 
Wolverines 
attempted 

an unsuccessful lob play to 
sophomore 
forward 
Kayla 

Robbins. But the referee stood 
with a fist in the air. A foul was 
called at the buzzer.

Crisler 
Center 
held 
its 

breath as the referees huddled 
together on the sideline to 
determine the outcome of the 
game.

The foul stood and Robbins 

walked up to the free-throw 
line. Crisler was silent again. 
The first shot bounced off the 
rim. Robbins had one more 
chance to secure the win.

She dribbled twice, bent her 

knees, and shot.

It didn’t go in. The game was 

going into overtime.

“A game doesn’t end up 

in the last play,” said junior 
forward Hallie Thome. “A lot 
leads to that so to put ourselves 
in that position, we definitely 
messed up.”

It was clear from the start 

this was going to be a tough 
game for the Wolverines when 
senior forward Jillian Dunston 
was thrown to the ground 
battling for the opening tip.

Soon after, junior guard 

Nicole Munger was sent flying 
into the photographers at the 
baseline at the eight minute 
mark.

Purdue opened the game at a 

fast pace and it took Michigan 
some time to adjust. The 
Boilermakers scored early and 

often and at seven minutes, the 
Wolverines called a timeout, as 
Purdue was up, 11-4.

Though the Boilermakers 

controlled the first quarter, 
the second was dominated by 
the Wolverines.

Led by aggressive play from 

Thome, Michigan battled it’s 
way to the lead and forced 
Purdue to call a timeout at 7:17, 
with the score at 31-26.

The 
Wolverines 
kept 

applying 
pressure 
though, 

finishing the first half with a 
42-36 lead.

They did not let up in the 

third quarter either. Freshman 
forward Hailey Brown led 
Michigan in points at the end 
of the quarter with 18 and 
helped Michigan keep its lead, 
66-54.

Though Purdue was down, 

it did not let up the aggression. 
It continued to fight and put on 
pressure until the very end.

And with 16 unanswered 

points in the fourth quarter, 
the 
Boilermakers 
tied 
up 

the game and pushed it into 
overtime.

“They continued to score 

and we weren’t scoring so 
closing the gap was the only 
thing 
that 
was 
happening 

and we couldn’t stop the 
bleeding,” Dunston said, “It’s 
harder to stop the other team’s 
momentum than it is to break a 
scoring drought.”

In overtime, every basket 

that 
Michigan 
scored 
was 

immediately 
answered 
by 

the 
Boilermakers 
resulting 

in a very tight game. Purdue 
eventually pulled ahead and 
the Wolverines were down by 
one with a chance to take the 
win, but fell just short.

Despite the loss, Michigan 

aims to learn from the game 
and prepare for the difficult 
schedule ahead of them.

“Every time you lose, it gives 

you an opportunity to improve 
and an opportunity to look 
at yourself, individually and 
collectively,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico.

Michigan blows lead in overtime loss to Boilermakers

Kim Barnes Arico stared at 

the ground and spoke into it.

“Well, that was a tough one.”
A true statement if there ever 

was one. The No. 13 Michigan 
women’s basketball team (8-3 
Big Ten, 19-5 overall) was up, 
72-56, cruising to victory over 
Purdue (15-8, 6-3), when the 
bottom fell out.

A 16-point lead became 14, 

then 11. Two minutes went by 
without either side scoring, 
and then the lead became eight. 
The tension started to build. 
Junior center Hallie Thome 
and freshman forward Hailey 
Brown — who scored 20 and 18 
points on the night, respectively 
— were both playing with four 
fouls. The Wolverines hadn’t 
scored in three minutes.

“We 
stopped 
being 

aggressive on the offensive 
end,” Barnes Arico said. “And 
we got really tentative.”

Instead of mere stops, Purdue 

started 
forcing 
turnovers. 

Lamina Cooper picked off a 
kickout pass to senior guard 
Katelynn Flaherty made from 
the post and was off to the 
races, cutting the lead to six 
with just over two minutes to 
go. Michigan hadn’t scored in 
four minutes.

“I think we were so timid,” 

Dunston 
said, 
stopping 
to 

search for the right adjective. 
“And 
then 
it 

was 
getting 

like, 
three, 

two, 
one 
on 

the shot clock, 
which 
isn’t, 

like, normal for 
us. We don’t try 
to run the shot 
clock 
down. 

And then, by 
then, we had no, 
like, there was 
no way we could have scored 
with the position we were in. It 
just continued to happen.”

Purdue’s Tamara Farquhar 

converted a driving layup to cut 
the lead to four, and the tension 
ratcheted up a notch. But with 
just over a minute to go and the 
Wolverines still holding a two-
possession lead, the odds were 
still in their favor — at 95.9 
percent, to be exact, according 
to ESPN.com’s win probability 
model. But yet, Michigan hadn’t 
scored in five minutes.

“I think we got comfortable,” 

Thome 
said. 
“And 
so 
we 

thought, with how we were 
playing on offense, ‘I mean, we 
got a big lead and so we didn’t 
need to score.’ So I think we 
were just too comfortable.”

Another possession, another 

turnover. The Boilermakers’ 
Dominique Oden stripped the 
ball from Flaherty, who fouled 
her immediately. Purdue was 
in the bonus, and two free 
throws later, within two points. 
Next time down, Flaherty cut 
backdoor and found a lane. She 

went for the layup and was met 
by the Boilermakers’ Ae’Rianna 
Harris, who spiked the ball out 
of bounds. On the subsequent 
inbounds play, Brown’s entry 
pass to Thome was stolen. 
Michigan hadn’t scored in six 
minutes.

“(Purdue) did a triangle-and-

two for a little bit on (Katelynn) 
and Nicole (Munger), and then 
they switched to a matchup 

zone,” 
Barnes 

Arico said. “And 
we just kinda got 
really stagnant. 
We didn’t really 
move the ball like 
we had been, and 
we got stagnant. 
And I think they 
took 
advantage 

of that.”

After forcing 

the 
turnover, 

Boilermakers’ 
coach 
Sharon 

Versyp 
called 
timeout 

immediately. The ensuing play 
— a 3-point look for Karissa 
McLaughlin 
coming 
off 
a 

screen — didn’t work, as the 
shot missed. Purdue didn’t win 
the ensuing scramble for the 
rebound either, playing it to a 
draw. The possession arrow 
rewarded 
the 
Boilermakers 

with the ball. From there, a 
baseline floater from Oden tied 
the game and sucked whatever 
life still existed out of Crisler 
Center.

Even with 0.7 seconds to 

work with, and even with 
sophomore 
forward 
Kayla 

Robbins at the free throw line, 
a loss felt preordained for the 
Wolverines. Robbins missed 
the free throws, but nobody 
can blame the loss on her doing 
so. When the second drew iron 
and bounced out, the buzzer 
sounded to mark overtime, but 
by then it was too late.

It had been six minutes and 

48 seconds since Michigan last 
scored.

Michigan women’s basketball coach Kim Barnes Arico categorized Thursday’s loss to Purdue as “a tough one.”

Wolverines set to face eighth-ranked Badgers in home weekend series

As the Michigan hockey team 

skated off the ice in Columbus 
last weekend with their heads 
hung low, the disappointment 
was evident.

After 
a 
strong 
start 
to 

the 
calendar 
year 
for 
the 

Wolverines, a poor showing 
by special teams and generally 
lackluster offense aided then-
No. 6 Ohio State in securing 
a series sweep. However, the 
sulking seems to have been 
short-lived.

“Actually, the mood’s been 

pretty good (in the locker 
room),” said Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson after Tuesday’s 
practice. “Especially this time 
of year because ... you can sort 
of see the end, see the finish 
line. And we like where we’re 

at.”

And for the Wolverines, this 

shift in mindset is a necessity. 
Eight games lie between No. 20 
Michigan 
and 

the first round 
of the Big Ten 
Tournament. 
Just six of those 
are 
Big 
Ten 

matchups, 
and 

just half of them 
are on home ice.

Two 
of 
the 

remaining 
matchups 
will 

take place this 
weekend at Yost Ice Arena, 
as Michigan (7-9-2-1 Big Ten, 
12-12-2 overall) hosts No. 18 
Wisconsin 
(7-8-2-1, 
13-12-3) 

in their second meeting of the 
season.

During their first encounter 

in Madison, the Wolverines 
had to settle for a loss and 
a 
tie. 
In 
the 
first 
game, 

Michigan allowed seven goals 

— the most it has 
surrendered 
in 

any outing this 
season — which 
was 
largely 

representative 
of its unresolved 
defensive 
troubles at the 
time.

But a lot has 

changed 
since 

November. 
For 

that reason, Pearson expects 
this series to play out a lot 
differently than it did in the 
fall, particularly when it comes 
to team defense.

“Tighter 
defensively,” 

Pearson said. “I don’t think 

you’ll see seven goals put up 
by either team on either night. 
I think you’ll see lower scoring 
games; I really believe that. 
I 
think 
you’ll 

see tight, hard-
fought 
games. 

I 
think 
the 

intensity is going 
to be good, it 
could get a little 
chippy.”

Though 

Michigan 
showed 
signs 

of 
reverting 

back to its poor 
defensive practices in the Ohio 
State series, over the past month 
things have generally been 
looking up for the Wolverines’ 
blueline. Michigan currently 
averages 14.58 blocked shots 
per game — good for seventh 
in the nation — a stat that was 
largely on display in its recent 
series with No. 12 Minnesota 
and No. 17 Penn State.

On the other side of the ice, 

though, the Wolverines and 
Badgers are top conference 
performers. Wisconsin comes 

in at second in the Big Ten, 
averaging 3.24 goals per game, 
while 
Michigan 
trails, 
just 

behind at third, averaging 3.19.

Pearson 

aptly described 
the 
Badgers’ 

attack unit as 
“balanced,” 
as 

nine 
players 

have tallied at 
least 16 points 
on the season. 
Wisconsin 
has 

shown 
that 
it 

not only has a 
powerhouse 

offense but also has one of 
depth.

“They like to play a puck-

possession 
skilled 
game,” 

Pearson said. “The forwards 
are as good as anybody in the 
league. I think one through 12 
they might have the deepest 
group, the best group, as far as 
guys who can put the puck in 
the net.”

Another 
factor 
that 

differentiates the Wolverines’ 
series with the Badgers this 
time around will be the weight 

it holds. Claiming the series this 
far along in the season could be 
decisive for either team.

“There’s a lot at stake,” 

Pearson said. “This is as big a 
series as they’ve had this year, 
and it’s as big a series as we’ve 
had.”

Added senior forward Tony 

Calderone: “I think they are 
a very similar team to us. It’s 
going to come down to who 
wants it more and who plays 
harder.”

And with few home games 

left, Michigan’s upperclassmen 
have 
been 
considering 
the 

legacy they want to leave in 
their final games at Yost.

“Yeah, it definitely hits home 

now,” Calderone said. As we get 
closer (to the end of the season), 
it’s kind of crazy how fast time 
goes. And Coach reminds us 
that we only have so much time 
left, so we have to make the best 
of it.”

With the home advantage, 

league standings on the line and 
a sense of urgency, Michigan 
looks eager to make these last 
games count.

Senior forward Tony Calderone and the Michigan hockey team is realizing that their opportunities are running out.

After a series in Columbus that put Mel Pearson’s team on the ropes, they return to Yost looking for redemption

“I don’t think 
you’ll see seven 
goals put up by 
either team.”

“They like to 
play a puck-
possessioned, 
skilled game.”

“We stopped 

being aggressive 

on the offensive 

end.”
