As immigration status has 
become an increasingly divisive 
political topic in recent years, 
student organizations and local 
activists are working to advocate 
undocumented 
students 
and 
Washtenaw County residents.
Local activist organization, 
Washtenaw Interfaith Coalition 
for 
Immigrant 
Rights, 
has 
addressed issues of immigration 
enforcement 
by 
advocating 
for and providing support to 
the families of undocumented 
individuals 
who 
have 
experienced raids or deportation 
orders by U.S. Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement.
WICIR was founded in 2008 

in response to a mobile home 
raid in Washtenaw County. Since 
then, ICE and local authorities 
have conducted several raids 
and local authorities, including 
a 2013 raid that displaced at 
least 15 individuals in Ypsilanti 
Township and a 2017 raid during 
which three employees at Sava’s 
in Ann Arbor were detained.
William 
Lopez, 
WICIR 
volunteer and Public Health 
professor, said the organization 
engages 
in 
anti-deportation 
campaigns, 
locates 
missing 
individuals and has implemented 
an urgent-response system for 
immigration-related 
issues. 
WICIR’s website also says the 
organization 
helps 
educate 
immigrants about their rights 
and resources.

According to Lopez, another 
main component of WICIR’s 
work is assisting the families of 
detained individuals. He said the 
families of detainees have basic 
needs that are often overlooked.
“People 
most 
often 
need 
food, they need diapers, they 
just need the stuff of everyday 
life,” Lopez said. “We focused so 
much attention on deportation 
that we forget the deeply human 
element.”
Immigration 
policies 
have 
shifted 
over 
the 
course 
of 
WICIR’s existence. Lopez said 
the Postville, Iowa raid of 2008, 
which led to the deportation 
of almost 400 workers, elicited 
such a negative public reaction 
that ICE began moving away 
from large-scale work raids. The 

Obama administration favored 
smaller raids and collaboration 
with 
local 
law 
enforcement 
officers, a decision that Lopez 
said decreased trust of police 
and led to a record number of 
removals.
Under 
the 
Trump 
administration, 
Lopez 
said, 
coordination 
between 
immigration officials and local 
police has continued. There 
has also been an uptick in 
workplace raids.

“With 
Trump, 
we 
see 
a return of these large-
scale work raids,” Lopez 
said. “In my opinion, very 
purposefully visible f lexing

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Approximately 
25 
students 
and 
faculty 
members gathered at Bert’s 
Cafe Monday night for the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
Library Cafe Shapiro’s first 
night of a weeklong poetry 
and 
short 
story 
reading 
event.
The 
event 
has 
been 
happening annually for more 
than 20 years, and this year 

there are a total of 55 student 
writers speaking over the 
course of 6 nights. Students 
are invited to participate 
in the event after they’ve 
been nominated by their 
professors.
Student 
Engagement 
Librarian 
Amanda 
Peters, 
a host of the event, said the 
event began in 1997 and has 
only grown since. She said 
one of the goals of the series 
is to expand the impact of 
creative writing on campus.

“It’s been going on for 22 
years, and it started as part 
of the University’s Year of 
the Humanities and Arts, 
so that was kind of a special 
thing that had happened that 
particular year,” Peters said. 
“It had a goal to explore the 
role of arts and humanities in 
civic and community life. It’s 
just become so much more 
than that over the years. 
It has become this really 
amazing event for students 
to come and share their work 

in this informal way, but it’s 
just really cool to see how it 
keeps growing and growing 
and we get more nominations 
every year from our faculty.”
Peters 
said 
the 
event 
is a great opportunity for 
undergraduate 
writers 
to 
gain confidence reading their 
work aloud to an audience 
and a chance for attendees 
to learn more about the 
University 
community 
through student voices.

The 
Senate 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
University 
Affairs 
held 
its 
weekly 
meeting Monday afternoon, 
discussing recent changes to 
the University of Michigan’s 
Standard 
Practice 
Guide 
and 
the 
introduction 
of 
electronic voting into Senate 
Assembly. SACUA also hosted 
University Provost Martin 
Philibert to speak on the new 
Biosciences Initiative.
SACUA Chair Neil Marsh, 
professor 
of 
chemistry, 
urged committee members 
to help with the nomination 
of candidates for SACUA 
in the upcoming election. 
According to the committee, 
only three out of the six 
needed 
nominations 
have 
been made.
“One 
engineering,” 
Director Tom Schneider said. 
“And two LS&A’s.”

Retired MSU professor presents five

Nearly 
every 
retrospective 
memorializing 
the 
late 
U.S. 
Rep. 
John 
Dingell, 
D-Mich., 
remembered the 92-year-old as 
a man of another era. Dingell, 
first elected to the House of 
Representatives in 1955, served 
in Congress for 59 years in a 
political career that spanned 11 
presidencies.
Dingell, the longest serving 
member of Congress in U.S. history, 
passed away in his Dearborn home 
Thursday evening after he entered 
hospice care just the day before. He 
was diagnosed with cancer earlier 
in 2018, yet remained a force to be 
reckoned with, often going viral 
on his Twitter account with sharp 
political quips and commentary.
A host of family and friends, 
political allies and adversaries, 
journalists 
and 
commentators 
are painting the congressman as 
more than a memory. Dingell’s life 
and death, they say, is of utmost 
importance for our politics today.

Lawrence 
Busch, 
professor 
emeritus 
of 
sociology 
at 
Michigan 
State University, spoke to 
University 
of 
Michigan 
students and faculty Monday 
evening about markets from 
an economic perspective in 
his presentation sponsored 
by the University’s Science, 
Technology 
and 
Society 
Program.
Busch 
began 
his 
presentation, titled “Back to 
the Future: An STS Approach 
to Markets,” by explaining 
three 
different 
ways 
of 
examining markets. He said 
markets can be examined 
as an economic transaction, 
as a place where politics are 
enacted and as an institution. 
According 
to 
Busch, 
mainstream 
economics 
firms focus on the economic 
transaction 
approach 
and 
ignore 
political 
and 
institutional examinations.
“(Mainstream economics) 
simply says those approaches 
aren’t 
economical. 
What 
this allows economics to do, 
I will argue, is to remove 
the political from markets,” 
Busch said. “At the same 
time, however, as economics 
does this, is that economics 

is performative. We need to 
examine how the theoretical 
treatment 
of 
markets 
actually influences actual 
markets.”
Busch 
discussed 
five 
propositions 
throughout 
the 
presentation. 
In 
his 
first proposition, “Markets 
are 
impure 
distributive 
systems,” Busch described 
the perfect image of markets. 
He said in actual markets, 
corruption is to be found and 
wages are typically biased 
in respect to race, ethnicity, 
gender and class.
“I want to argue that 
actual markets are always 
in 
perfect 
distributive 
systems, and that untethered 
markets 
lead 
to 
massive 
inequality,” Busch said. “I 
want to emphasize the point 
that the vast majority of the 
population still buy into the 
idea that markets are a pretty 
good distributive system.”
In the second proposition, 
“Markets do not differ in kind 
from 
other 
institutions,” 
Busch said economists are 
solely concerned with the 
efficiency of markets and 
are 
influenced 
by 
both 
human 
and 
non-human 
actions.

Students 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
received 
a 
total 
of 
24 
Fulbright grants for the 
2018-2019 academic year, 
according to the Chronicle 
of Higher Education. This 
is the highest number of 
Fulbright 
scholarships 
given 
to 
any 
public 
university for the 14th year 
in a row, according to the 
U.S. State Department.
The Fulbright Program, 
one of the most prestigious 
awards funded by the U.S. 
State Department, granted 
scholarships to University 
faculty members, alumni 
and students. The grants 
will be used to fund the 
scholar’s overseas research 
for six to 12 months.

In 
an 
interview 
with 
the 
University 
Record, 
University President Mark 
Schlissel 
commended 
the 
University’s 
newest 
Fulbright 
awardees 
for 
their dedication to making 
positive global impacts.
“U-M’s commitment to 
international 
education 
helps students and scholars 
gain 
new 
perspectives 
and 
higher 
levels 
of 
understanding that make 
our world a better and 
safer place,” Schlissel said.
There are two main types 
of 
Fulbright 
grants 
for 
students. English teaching 
assistantships provided by 
the Fulbright grant send 
students to other countries 
to work various jobs. There 
are 
additional 
academic 
Fulbright grants that can 
be used to seek a degree in 

another country or be used 
as an overseas research 
award. 
Beth 
Dutridge-
Corp, 
coordinator 
of 
International 
Institute 
fellowships and grants, and 
Heather Johnson, adviser 
of International Institute 
fellowships 
and 
grants, 

work 
with 
students 
and 
faculty 
members 
to apply for Fulbright 
scholarships.
Faculty 
members 
can 
apply 
for 
a 
separate 
Fulbright 
grant 
called 
Fulbright 
Scholars. 
This 
year, 
five University faculty 
received the Fulbright 
Scholar 
recognition. 
They 
include 
Yolain 
Civil, 
instructor 
of 
pediatrics; 
Seyed 
Mehdian, 
professor 
of 
finance at U-M Flint; 
Zora 
Longworth, 
research 
professor 
of 
family 
medicine; 
Jeffery 
Wilson, 
associate 
professor 
of 
paleontology; 
and 
Suleyman 
Uludag, 
interim 
associate 
professor 
of 
computer 
science at U-M Flint.
The 
University’s 
International 
Institute 
aides 
in 
advising 
Fulbright applicants and 
provides them with the 
resources to put forward 

a 
strong, 
competitive 
application. In an interview 
with 
the 
University 
Record, Johnson explained 
the University’s successes 
regarding 
the 
Fulbright 
grant.
“We have a seasoned team 
consisting 
of 
Fulbright 
Program 
advisers 
and 
faculty that is very invested 
in our applicants’ success,” 
Johnson said. “It also helps 
that 
U-M 
students 
are 
perennially impressive in 
their own right.”
Although 
the 
University’s 
Office 
of 
National Scholarships and 
Fellowships is not involved 
with the Fulbright grant, 
ONSF 
Director 
Henry 
Dyson 
highlighted 
the 
efforts 
put 
forth 
by 
Johnson 
and 
Dutridge-
Corp 
in 
the 
Fulbright 
application process.
“Beth and Heather are 
really fantastic at helping 
students 
find 
the 
best 
fit 
and 
articulate 
that 
through their applications, 
and it’s why I think it’s 
a 
huge 
advantage 
for 
us 
that 
we 
have 
these 
specialized 
advisers 
in 
the International Institute 
who dedicwate so much 
of their year to Fulbright 
advising,” Dyson said.
According to a video by 
Fulbright, 
scholars 
are 
considered to be current 
and future leaders who 
are committed to national 
engagement and open to 
new ideas.
 
“Above all, Fulbrighters 
exemplify the power of 
international 
academic 
exchange 
to 
transform 
lives, 
bridge 
geographic 
and cultural boundaries, 
and 
promote 
a 
more 
peaceful and prosperous 
world,” the video said.

U-M’s 
commitment to 
international 
education helps 
students and 
scholars gain new 
perspectives


“For some of them, it 
is their first time ever 
reading 
their 
work 
in 
front of an audience other 
than their classroom, and 
so we really like being 
able to give them that 
experience,” Peters said. 
“For the listeners, they’re 
just 
hearing 
so 
many 
interesting stories about 
the 
student 
experience 
because a lot of students 
are writing about their 
own life experiences or 
people they know.”
The 
event 
features 
students studying a wide 
variety 
of 
disciplines 
ranging 
from 
English 
and creative writing to 
psychology, public policy 
and computer science.
English lecturer John 
Buckley said he nominates 

his students to give them a 
chance to share their work 
in public.
“For the last couple of 
years, I’ve been privileged 
to 
teach 
through 
the 
Undergraduate 
Research 
Opportunity 
Program 
which enables me to pick 
three 
or 
four 
students 
to really do an intensive 
weekly 
workshop 
with 
and help them try to get 
published,” Buckley said. 
“Part of that always ends 
up being nominating them 
for Café Shapiro to give 
them publishing credit and 
give them a chance to read 
in public.”
Buckley 
said 
Café 
Shapiro really boosts his 
students’ 
confidence 
in 
their own abilities, and it is 
especially memorable and 
important for those who 
have never participated in 
an event like it before. 
“I think my students 
gain confidence,” Buckley 

said. “I think confidence 
is the big thing. Just like 
most things, the first time 
is the hardest. The first 
time is the scariest, so if 
we can get over this initial 
hump, that’s a big step.”
LSA 
junior 
Mahmuda 
Ahmed 
is 
an 
aspiring 
author 
and 
a 
student 
of 
Buckley. 
She 
was 
very 
flattered 
Buckley 
nominated her to share her 
work and said it would be 
her first time participating 
in a read in front of 
strangers.
“It was really cool (to 
be 
nominated) 
because 
I’ve never done anything 
like this before and my 
professor is really cool,” 
Ahmed said. “We’re in a 
creative 
writing 
group 
kind of thing so we work on 
our stories together, and 
this was one of the one’s 
they helped me edit and so 
this is the final product of 
it.”

In addition to providing 
a space for undergraduates 
to read their pieces, Café 
Shapiro 
publishes 
an 
anthology of all the work. 
Ahmed said she has never 
been 
published 
before 
and is excited about the 
opportunity. 
She 
added 
she 
appreciates 
how 
in addition to being an 
opportunity to share her 
own work, the event gives 
her a chance to listen to her 
peers and learn more about 
the campus community.
“I 
think 
I’ll 
gain 
experience,” Ahmed said. 
“Also, it will be published 
in the anthology too, right, 
so that’s also pretty cool. 
I’ve never had anything 
published before. And it’s 
just a really cool event, too 
— we get to hear readers 
and their stories, too.”

U.S. 
Rep. 
Debbie 
Dingell, 
D-Mich., John’s wife of 38 
years 
and 
congressional 
successor, wrote a Facebook 
post 
Friday 
evening 
recounting 
her 
husband’s 
final hours.
“He was lucid, visiting 
with 
friends, 
in 
charge 
until the end,” she wrote. 
“And trust me he knew 
exactly what he wanted, 
when he wanted it and we 
did it his way… Tuesday 
he had asked for a pad of 
paper he had things he 
wanted to say. Writing had 
become hard. Wednesday he 
started dictating to me, had 
thoughts he wanted shared 
when his time came.”

These 
words 
made 
up 
John Dingell’s last op-ed, 
published in The Washington 
Post Friday morning with 
the 
preface 
that 
“some 
occasions merit more than 
280 
characters.” 
Dingell 
espoused 
congressional 
action and policy on climate 
change, 
health 
care 
and 
racial 
discrimination, 
among other topics. Over 
the course of his career, 
Dingell helped pass or cast 
critical votes on the Civil 
Rights Act, Medicare, the 
Clean Water and Clean Air 
acts and the Endangered 
Species Act.
“My personal and political 
character was formed in a 
different era that was kinder, 
if not necessarily gentler,” 
he 
wrote. 
“We 
observed 
modicums of respect even 
as we fought, often bitterly 

and savagely, over issues 
that were literally life and 
death to a degree that — 
fortunately – we see much 
less of today.”

The 
late 
congressman’s 
last public appearance on 
campus was last February 
alongside 
Debbie, 
where 

the pair answered questions 
from students in front of 
more than 100 at the Ford 
School 
of 
Public 
Policy. 
The Dingells are longtime 

supporters of the campus 
community, and University 
of 
Michigan 
President 
Mark Schlissel offered his 

condolences to the family in 
a statement Thursday.
“I 
considered 
John 
a 
historically 
significant 
public servant and man of 
great gravitas,” he wrote.
Dingell 
was 
also 
a 
longtime 
feature 
in 
the 
pages 
of 
The 
Michigan 
Daily, as journalists over 
the course of four decades 
interviewed and profiled the 
congressman. 
“RIP 
@JohnDingell,” 
Stephanie Steinberg, former 
editor in chief of The Daily, 
tweeted 
Thursday. 
“Thx 
for sending paczki to the @
michigandaily when I was 
EIC & always supporting 
student 
journalists. 
You 
were 1 of a kind.”
“I 
interviewed 
him 
a 
handful of times in college, 
and he was always generous 
with 
his 
time,” 
Joseph 

Lichterman, 
a 
former 
Daily arts writer, added on 
Twitter Thursday. “He also 
made fun of me on Twitter 
once, which is probably the 
best thing that happened to 
me on here.” 
Fifteen years ago, just 
hours before winning his 
26th 
term 
in 
Congress 
back in 2004, Dingell told 
Daily 
reporter 
Margaret 
Havemann he would govern 
until he couldn’t any more.
“If I can do it, I will,” 
he said. “There are a lot of 
people who have a say in 
what I do, the people and 
my wife being some of them. 
And if the good Lord says 
come up here with me, then 
I guess I will have to.”

“Markets don’t differ in 
kind from other institutions, 
it’s 
just 
that 
people 
in 
mainstream 
economics 
decided that they were going 
to focus on this mathematical 
aspect of markets and ignore 
the rest,” Busch said.
In the discussion of his 
third 
proposition, 
“The 
histories of economics and 
of economics fail to take 
standards 
into 
account,” 
Busch 
explained 
the 
history 
behind 
economic 
institutions. He emphasized 
the importance of learning 
market history to understand 
the 
functions 
of 
modern 
markets.
“The histories of markets 
and economics fail to take 
standards 
into 
account 
because 
each 
former 
standard creates a different 
form 
of 
market,” 
Busch 
said. “The trend is towards 
greater concentration and a 
greater ability to manipulate 
thoughts.”
The 
fourth 
proposition 
was 
“Supply 
chains 
and 
financialization 
create 
inequalities.” 
Busch 
said 
there has been a massive 
increase in inequality in the 
United States within the last 
25 years.
“Banks used to invest in 
order 
to 
produce 
things, 
and 
now 
they 
invest 
in 
order to maximize return 
in investment,” Busch said. 
“They’re fickle with respect 
to firms but they are loyal 
with respect to capital.”
In 
Busch’s 
final 
proposition, “Economics lies 
behind changes in actual 
markets,” he explained the 
market 
standardization 
that 
makes 
economics 
predictable.
“At the same time that 

economics is performative, 
it is performative in two 
ways,” Busch said. “It is 
performative in the sense 
that it provides a model 
for performing firms and 
markets, 
and 
it’s 
also 
performative in the sense 
that it provides a model of 
public 
understanding 
of 
markets.”
John Carson, STS faculty 
member 
and 
associate 
history professor, explained 
the complex nature of the 
markets Busch described to 
The Daily after the event.
“Markets 
are 
not 
the 
simple, 
easy 
methods 
of 
allocation 
that 
they’re 
sometimes thought to be, 
but that they are complex 
social institutions that need 
to be seen in all the different 
functions 
that 
they 
do,” 
Carson said. “They need to be 
thought about as to how we 
can use them in ways that are 
good and what really are all 
the elements that are a part 
of them, not just the ways 
that prices are allocated.”

She 
said 
her 
greatest 
takeaway 
from 
Busch’s 
presentation was receiving 
a 
new 
understanding 
of 
the traditional supply and 
demand model.
“Abstract 
models 
shape 
market practice and shape 
public 
perceptions 
of 
markets,” 
Maloul 
said. 
“Probably 
the 
largest 
takeaway that I got was that 
the models that my students 
express in class when we 
talk about market systems 
— because we talk about 
market systems a lot — are 
still those very old models 
that have zero consciousness 
of contemporary models, the 
ones that he described.”

“With Trump, we see 
a return of these large-
scale work raids,” Lopez 
said. 
“In 
my 
opinion, 
very purposefully visible 
f lexing of muscle.”
The 
University 
of 
Michigan 
has 
also 
reacted 
to 
recent 
immigration 
policy 
changes. 
In 
response 
to 
travel 
restrictions 
imposed by the Trump 
administration, 
University 
President 
Mark Schlissel announced 
in 2017 the University 
would not disclose the 
immigration status of its 
students.
The 
University 
welcomes 
applications 
regardless of immigration 
status, 
according 
to 
a 
U-M 
website 
for 
undocumented 
students 
created 
by 
Student 
Community of Progressive 
Empowerment 
and 
the 
Office 
of 
Academic 
Multicultural Initiatives.
Noting 
none 
of 
WICIR’s anti-deportation 
campaigns 
have 
been 
successful since Trump’s 
election, 
Lopez 
said 
ICE appears to be less 
concerned 
with 
its 
image than in previous 
administrations.
“ICE’s 
public 
face 
used 
to 
be 
something 
that would cause them 
to change what they are 
doing. It’s no longer the 
case, generally speaking, 
anymore,” 
Lopez 
said. 
“They’re not ashamed of 
their violent immigration 
enforcement tactics.”
Because 
Washtenaw 
County 
is 
not 
located 
on a U.S. border, Lopez 

said 
most 
immigration 
enforcement occurs when 
an undocumented person 
gets a traffic ticket or 
an arrest. He said this 
makes 
undocumented 
immigrants less trusting 
of 
public 
services, 
especially 
since 
the 
Trump 
administration 
proposed 
a 
“public 
charge” rule in October 
2018. 
The 
law 
would 
deny 
legal 
status 
to 
undocumented 
people 
who use certain public 
benefits.
“There’s this ambient 
fear 
of 
the 
unknown 
and of the potentially 
catastrophic that shakes 
folks’ 
willingness 
to 
use 
medical 
care 
and 
social 
services 
and 
interact with government 
officers,” 
Lopez 
said. 
“I’m not in the business of 
encouraging folks to trust 
law enforcement if their 
judgement tells them that 
they shouldn’t.”
Jason Forsberg, deputy 
chief of the Ann Arbor 
Police Department, said 
Chapter 120 of the city 
code, 
which 
prohibits 
public 
servants 
from 
asking about immigration 
status except in cases 
such 
as 
a 
criminal 
investigation, warrant or 
federal order, is meant to 
encourage undocumented 
people 
to 
trust 
law 
enforcement.
“The 
spirit 
behind 
that ordinance is that 
we don’t want people to 
be afraid to call us when 
they need help, and so 
that’s why when people 
are witnesses or victims 
of 
crimes, 
we 
would 
never ask for immigrant 
status,” Forsberg said.
Forsberg 
added 
most 
of the county follows a 

similar policy. The Board 
of 
Commissioners 
of 
Washtenaw County has 
publishedwritten support 
for 
local 
immigrant 
communities.
“Most, if not all, of the 
agencies in Washtenaw 
County, law enforcement 
agencies, 
have 
gotten 
together and we’re all 
sort of in agreement on 
how we would handle 
these types of things,” 
Forsberg said.
The 
U-M 
Division 
of 
Public 
Safety 
and 
Security follows a similar 
policy by only inquiring 
about immigration status 
in the case of a security 
threat, warrant or felony. 
According 
to 
DPSS 
Deputy 
Chief 
Melissa 
Overton, 
however, 
the 
University rarely has to 
communicate with ICE.
“We rarely have to talk 
to them,” Overton said. 
“We have had things in 
the past, but I can’t tell 
you how long ago it’s 
been. It’s mainly when 
somebody’s been arrested 
under 
another 
warrant 
and it comes up that 
they’re not here legally.”
LSA 
sophomore 
Sandra Perez is league 
representative 
for 
the 
Student 
Community 
of 
Progressive 
Empowerment, 
an 
organization 
that 
supports 
for 
undocumented 
and 
DACA-supported 
students. 
Perez 
said 
she and her peers are 
still pushing for change 
at 
U-M. 
For 
instance, 
SCOPE will attend the 
next 
meeting 
of 
the 
University’s 
Board 
of 
Regents to discuss the 
University’s 
28-month 
policy, 
which 
states 

undocumented 
students 
only qualify as in-state 
students if they attended 
Michigan 
high 
schools 
and middle schools and 
matriculated 
to 
the 
University 
within 
28 
months 
of 
graduating 
high school.
Perez said the 28-month 
rule is unfairly stringent 
toward 
undocumented 
students, 
especially 
because 
undocumented 
students can’t apply for 
federal 
financial 
aid, 
making the cost of out-of-
state tuition particularly 
challenging. 
SCOPE 
is 
working 
to 
eliminate 
the policy or change its 
interpretation.
“It is a discriminatory 
policy for undocumented 
students, 
specifically 
because a way to prove 
in-state 
residency 
is 
providing 
(proof ) 
from 
middle 
or 
high 
school,” Perez said. “An 
undocumented 
student 
can 
provide 
all 
that 
information 
and 
more, 
and yet still be denied just 
because of the 28-month 
rule.”
Though there are no 
figures on the number of 
undocumented 
students 
on 
the 
University’s 
campus, Perez, who is 
under 
the 
protection 
of 
DACA 
herself, 
said 
SCOPE works with many 
undocumented students, 
helping 
them 
build 
leadership skills and find 
a community on campus.
“This 
is 
a 
very 
marginalized identity in 
a large university,” Perez 
said.

Marsh 
then 
updated 
the 
committee on the discussion 
he and Senate Secretary David 
Potter had with the Vice Provost 
for Academic and Budgetary 
Affairs Christine Gerdes regarding 
the committee’s concern and 
suggested revisions about the 
newFaculty-Student Relationships 
Standard Practice Guide.
“Those 
concerns 
were 
transmitted 
to 
the 
Provost’s 
Office,” Marsh said. “David and I 
also had a meeting with Christine 
Gerdes about some of the revisions. 
In general, most of those revisions 
are positively received.”
SACUA 
then 
welcomed 
University 
Provost 
Martin 
Philbert, 
who 
informed 
the 
committee 
about 
the 
new 
Biosciences 
Initiative, 
which 
aims to create better access to 
on-campus 
core 
researching 
facilities for students and faculties.

“This idea would be for all 
sorts of cores, instrumentation, 
capability and all sorts of expertise 
that’s 
distributed 
across 
the 
campus,” Philbert said. “Some of it 
rare, some of it relatively abundant, 
but not worth any individual 
investigator 
investigating. 
The 
intention is to make them more 
readily navigable and available.”
The committee then discussed 
the most recent SPG changes 
regarding felony charge reporting 
and faculty-student relationships. 
The committee expressed concern 
regarding their lack of involvement 
in the process of the creation and 
passing of these changes to the 
provost.
Committee 
members 
said 
they feel disappointed not having 
involvement or a voice every time 
a specially appointed committee 
is 
formed 
without 
their 
knowledge.

I

t is hard to recall any 

generally well-liked public 

figure who has so deeply 

or quickly damaged their own 

reputation as former Starbucks 

CEO Howard Schultz. It only 

took him a week, but he managed 

to piss off almost the entirety of 

the Democratic Party.

During an appearance on 

CBS’s “60 Minutes” to promote 

his new book, Schultz disclosed 

he is considering running for 

president in the 2020 election. 

He is just another in a long list 

of 
people 
announcing 
their 

intentions 
to 
run, 
including 

Sen. 
Elizabeth 
Warren, 

D-Mass., Julián Castro, former 

Secretary of Housing and Urban 

Development, 
Sen. 
Kirsten 

Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Sen. Kamala 

Harris, D-Calif., Mayor Pete 

Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., 

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., Former 

Congressman 
John 
Delaney, 

D-Md. and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, 

D-Minn. 
Despite 
an 
already 

loaded field, it is likely that even 

more candidates will join the 

race, especially given some of the 

prominent potential candidates, 

such as former Vice President 

Joe 
Biden 
and 
Sen. 
Bernie 

Sanders, I-Vt., have yet to declare 

their own decisions.

Unlike the rest of these 

candidates, Schultz does not 

intend to vie for the Democratic 

nomination for president, despite 

being a lifelong Democrat. He 

said, “I am seriously thinking 

of running for president. I will 

run as a centrist independent, 

outside of the two-party system.”

In deciding to run as an 

independent, Schultz has decided 

to skip the fight. The point of a 

party primary is for candidates 

to present their ideas to the party 

and convince voters that their 

plan for the country is the best 

one. A primary allows a group 

of people with similar values to 

debate and vote on policies that 

best fulfill those values.

“The way I’ve come to this 

decision is, I believe that if I 

ran as a Democrat, I would have 

to say things that I know in my 

heart I do not believe, and I 

would have to be disingenuous,” 

Schultz said.

He has decided that his 

policies are so unattractive that 

he will refuse to do the hard 

work of persuasion, and instead, 

risk the re-election of President 

Donald Trump. Unlike the other 

candidates who have declared 

their candidacy, Schultz can 

use his billions to get his name 

on the ballot in every state 

and hire the best pollsters 

and strategists. These billions 

allow him to skip the debate 

exactly when the electability of 

candidates is so crucial.

In doing so, Schultz poses 

a problem for the country. If he 

runs as an independent, he could 

shave off enough votes, even if 

it is just 3 to 4 percent of votes, 

from the Democratic candidate 

to deliver a fatal blow. As a 

fiscally conservative and socially 

liberal centrist, Schultz does 

not have a big enough coalition 

to win. He does, however, have 

a big enough coalition to ensure 

a Trump victory. See Ross Perot 

and Ralph Nader.

This is the Howard Schultz 

problem, but there is also a 

problem with Howard Schultz. 

In the time since he has mused 

about running for president, 

he has not actually presented 

a substantive plan for the 

future of the country. He has 

not offered one single positive 

policy to solve the myriad of 

problems the country faces. He 

has also not explained why he 

wants to be president or why he 

thinks he should be president.

Instead, 
Schultz 
has 

attacked 
Democrats. 
He 

called 
Elizabeth 
Warren’s 

new wealth tax “ridiculous” 

and said Kamala Harris’ plan 

to eliminate private health 

insurance was “not American.” 

All of these attacks do little 

to help the Democratic Party 

but do a lot to fuel Republican 

vitriol and talking points.

He has demonstrated the 

same egotism — the same “I 

alone can fix it” — attitude as 

Donald Trump in 2016. So far, he 

has predicated his presidential 

run on his business success. To 

be fair, he did implement several 

progressive 
policies 
while 

running Starbucks he could 

potentially base his candidacy 

on, such as intentionally hiring 

both refugees and veterans, 

as well as giving employees 

paid parental and sick leave. 

However, he has not cited these 

reasons for his announcement. 

And if one thing is clear from the 

past two years, it is that being 

the CEO of a company does not 

qualify you to be president of the 

United States.

Understanding the Polar Vortex

T

he recent polar vortex 
that swept through the 
Midwest trapped many 
inside as temperatures 
dropped 
dangerously 
low, resulting in the 
University 
canceling 
classes for just the third 
time in the past 40 years 
due to weather. Indeed, 
everyone bundled up 
and watched as the 
whole state seemed to 
shut down for a few 
days — stores closed 
early 
or 
altogether, 
schools canceled classes and only 
the bravest among us dared spend 
more than a few minutes outside at 
a time.
Now that we are safely on the 
other side of the winter storm, as 
we thaw ourselves and our frozen 
pipes, it is important to take a 
closer look at exactly what the 
polar vortex is, and what it means 
for us in the Midwest in the future. 
Unfortunately, as is customary by 
this point, some politicians took 
to Twitter and attempted to use 
the cold weather to attack the 
science of climate change among 
other environmental ideas. Apart 
from being wildly scientifically 
inaccurate, this kind of rhetoric 
is careless and dangerous to 
public interests.
Before delving into the different 
examples, we ought to establish the 
baseline in definitions. According 
to the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric 
Administration, 
“(W)eather refers to short-term 
changes in the atmosphere, climate 
describes what the weather is 
like over a long period of time in 
a specific area.” To put it simply, 
weather refers to the everyday 
fluctuations of the atmosphere 
— 
temperature, 
precipitation, 
humidity, etc. — and climate is the 
general average in an area over a 
long period of time. A great analogy 
is that weather is your mood, 
whereas climate is your personality.
Climate 
change 
is 
the 
scientific phenomenon of rising 
global temperatures on average 
over time due primarily to the 
addition of greenhouse gases to 
our atmosphere. While the data 
surrounding climate change is 
rather undeniable, it remains 
a political issue. Regardless of 
political views, however, climate 
change is happening and is already 
affecting the United States.
This 
doesn’t 
stop 
some 
politicians 
from 
taking 
every 
opportunity available to express 
disbelief. President Donald Trump 

tweeted out his thoughts about 
the polar vortex, suggesting it was 
connected to global warming. 
“In 
the 
beautiful 
Midwest, 
windchill 
temperatures 
are 
reaching minus 60 
degrees, the coldest 
ever 
recorded,” 
President 
Trump 
wrote. “People can’t 
last outside even for 
minutes. What the 
hell is going on with 
Global [sic] Waming? 
Please come back fast, 
we need you!”
This is not the first time the 
president used cold temperatures 
to try and sow doubt about climate 
change, nor is he the only politician 
to use this tactic. Famously in 
2015, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., 
brought a snowball onto the Senate 
floor in an attempt to prove global 
warming is a hoax.

In an even more bizarre move, 
political pundit Jim Hoft tried 
using the cold temperatures against 
renewable energy, tweeting, “It’s 
a bit cold outside this morning in 
middle America... Aren’t you glad 
you aren’t heating your home with 
a solar panel like nitwit Socialist 
@AOC is demanding?” What I 
believe was supposed to be an 
attack on U.S. Rep. Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal 
backfired on Hoft as many were 
quick to point out that the sun does 
indeed still shine when it is cold 
(in fact, solar panels can be more 
efficient in colder temperatures). 
It is clear that there is a severe 
misunderstanding of the climate 
science surrounding the polar 
vortex. Despite the dramatic name, 
the polar vortex isn’t anything out 
of the ordinary or all that unique. 
Moreover, 
our 
conversations 
surrounding it ought to reflect our 
scientific understanding.
As Simon Clark, an Oxford alum 
who has a doctorate in theoretical 
atmosphere and physics, points 
out in a recent YouTube video, the 
vortex is something that always 

exists and is constantly moving. 
“The polar vortex is a big, zonal 
circulation in the stratosphere 
that forms every year,” Clark says. 
“Usually, the circulation stays 
in a tight circulation around the 
poles, but every seven years or 
so the vortex weakens, causing it 
to dip further south, resulting in 
the arctic temperatures felt in the 
Midwest last week.”
Interestingly, climate scientists 
are studying the cycle of the 
vortex to see if there are any long-
run effects of global warming 
on the phenomenon. As global 
temperatures 
rise, 
extreme 
weather events are predicted to 
increase in frequency and volatility. 
While there is evidence to show 
changes in atmospheric jet streams 
due to rapid Arctic warming, 
there is inconclusive data thus far 
to prove a concrete connection 
between 
climate 
change 
and 
increased frequency of the polar 
vortex cycle.
While there is no conclusive 
evidence yet showing if or how 
the polar vortex cycle will be 
affected by climate change, it 
should absolutely not be used by 
politicians to try and contradict it. 
If anything, future observations 
and scientific study could prove 
the two to be linked — and that 
is 
something 
Midwesterners 
should pay close attention to. 
Reports show that during the 
three coldest days, the vortex cost 
the U.S. economy up to $5 billion 
due to closed businesses, schools 
and transportation. Additionally, 
effects 
of 
the 
dangerous 
temperatures claimed the lives 
of at least eight people, including 
a University of Iowa student. If 
there is a possibility that this is to 
happen more frequently as some 
researchers suggest, it could be 
very bad news for the Midwest.
It would be inaccurate to 
claim the polar vortex this year 
is directly a result of a changing 
climate. However, it does highlight 
that the Earth has an extremely 
complex 
climatic 
system 
and 
we ought to study it as closely as 
possible. Reducing it as something 
totally 
unique 
is 
a 
careless 
misrepresentation 
that 
could 
cost us in the future. By paying 
attention to climate scientists and 
the data, we can better prepare 
ourselves should this become a 
more commonplace occurrence 
and adapt accordingly if needed.

I 

will 
be 
the 
first 
to 

admit that I’m not the

or 

indeed, 
the 
most 

enthusiastic 
about 

the NFL. Growing up 

in San Diego, Calif., 

I was peripherally 

aware of the drama 

with Dean Spanos 

and 
the

culminating 
in 

their 
controversial

in

move

and 
his 
enormous

I’ve managed to obtain, by 

osmosis, a paltry collection 

of facts about the Detroit 

Lions thanks to many of my 

Michigan 
born-and-raised 

friends. 
Whether 
it’s 
the 

head trauma, the seemingly 

arbitrary scoring system or my 

lack of exposure to a winning 

team, I’ve just never been able 

to truly get into the world 

of professional football. My 

interest, however, was piqued 

when my boyfriend told me 

about Amazon Prime’s female

My 
view 
of 
football 

commentators 
and 
play-by-

play analysts is that they are 

meant to be a sort of default 

persona: They both explain the 

game to the viewer and are the 

viewer. They’re watching the 

game right along with you, 

they’re just as surprised as 

you are when someone runs 

30 million yards for a double 

touchdown or whatever, but 

also they have to show you the 

replay and explain how this 

man who probably has head 

trauma was able to exploit the 

weaknesses in the defense to 

score six points. Even so, this 

doesn’t seem like a difficult 

job, but it definitely seems like 

a man’s job: They have to be 

a default and have a normal, 

unassuming 
male 
voice 

because straight white men are 

seen as the default in American 

society. No woman is going 

to be seen as an everyman, a 

default in the eyes of the red-

blooded, 
male-dominated, 

football-watching public.

In September 2017, Beth 

Mowins called ESPN’s Monday 

Night Football game between 

the Los Angeles Chargers and 

the Denver Broncos, and she did 

it again this past year for the 

New York Jets and the Detroit 

Lions. I decided to meander on 

over to YouTube to listen to her 

commentate, just to get a feel 

for what that might have been 

like. In an interview 

with NPR, Hannah 

Storm 
describes 

NFL broadcasts as 

being 
“extremely 

technical, 
and 
to 

some … it kind of 

sounds like they’re 

speaking a different 

language.” I found 

elements of this to 

be true as I listened 

to Mowins; I had no 

idea what a “two-tight end set” 

was, but I felt the energy and 

excitement as she exclaimed, 

“Touchdown, Denver!” Though 

this 
may 
be 
subjective, 
I 

thought that Mowins was a 

really excellent commentator. 

She 
was 
knowledgeable, 

quick on the draw, and had 

a clear, audible voice that cut 

through the noise of the game. 

Though male is the default, her 

female voice did not feel out 

of place whatsoever. I found it 

refreshing and even assuring.

Sometimes when I watch 

football with other people, I feel 

stupid for not knowing what’s 

going on. Listening to Mowins, 

I didn’t. It was as though there 

was another woman in the room 

who made me feel less like an 

outsider, like I understood what 

it was like to be the default for 

once. I then made the mistake of 

scrolling down to the comments 

section of the video. “How to 

ruin a football game 101,” one 

said. “Made my ears bleed,” 

another 
complained. 
The 

comments continued in that 

manner, all of which seemed 

to be people complaining about 

her voice, an obvious code for 

“I hate that a woman is doing 

this.” One viewer even said, 

“wow... Between letting players 

disrespect our flag, including 

(f*ggy) 
male 
cheerleaders 

dancing like women and this 

abomination of an announcer, 

the NFL seems to really want to 

make sure people aren’t tuning 

into football anymore.” 

Beth 
Mowins 
is 
a 

consummate professional. She 

spends months preparing for 

each 
game. 
She 
researches 

not just the teams, but their 

divisions and their conferences, 

in order to paint a larger 

portrait of what’s happening 

in football. She handwrites 

and color-codes index cards 

and creates a game board of 

potential information she can 

use. She meets with her partner 

months ahead of time, and they 

watch old games and practice 

calling 
them 
together. 
She 

meets with players and coaches 

before games to get quotes and 

information she can use in a 

broadcast. She cares about her 

job, and it shows in the quality 

of her work and her commitment 

to detail. Furthermore, she 

has been lauded by industry 

professionals for her excellent 

work. The malicious comments 

on Twitter and YouTube come 

from a group so used to being 

the default, so used to football 

being 
“a 
bastion 
of 
male 

superiority” that they could 

not even begin to comprehend a 

woman being good at her job, let 

alone better than a man. Many 

criticized 
her 
broadcasting 

partner, 
former 
NFL 
coach 

Rex Ryan, for not being quite 

up to scratch. Though our dear 

friend from YouTube, who was 

so concerned about the NFL 

not wanting people to watch 

football, should be worried 

about a number of issues when 

it comes to the league, a woman 

broadcasting is not one of them. 

Accessibility 
and 
expanding 

to a wider audience is a huge 

focus for the NFL, and networks 

having female broadcasters on 

their teams have the potential to 

be that expanding factor.

My only gripe about Amazon 

Prime offering the option of 

Storm and Kremer commentating 

NFL games is that it is an option. 

Obviously, 
there 
is 
nothing 

Amazon can do about the Fox 

Sports and ESPN broadcasting 

crew when they offer those 

as 
well. 
However, 
it 
seems 

reductive to only make them a 

part of the company’s effort to 

“enable customers around the 

world to customize their viewing 

experience,” just as it feels 

reductive to relegate Mowins 

to a couple pre-season games 

and a single Monday Night 

Football doubleheader each 

season. All three of these 

women are seasoned sports 

journalists with more than 

enough credentials to call an 

NFL game. Though I, for one, 

will be tuning in to Amazon 

Prime to hear Storm and 

Kremer come autumn, I know 

many 
viewers, 
especially 

male viewers, will not. By 

giving 
these 
women 
the 

opportunity to do these jobs 

and do them well, we provide 

millions of other women the 

opportunity to truly feel a part 

of a national phenomenon, to 

hear themselves on a national 

stage, to know that there are 

opportunities for them in these 

fields. 
Male 
viewers, 
quite 

frankly, need to sit down and 

let these women do their jobs.

It’s apparent that the internet 
has shaped our culture in ways 
our grandparents couldn’t have 
imagined. The internet holds 
endless information that will take 
years to even brush the surface 
of, information that lends to the 
shaping of nations, of cultures, of 
racial oppression and destructive 
gender norms. The internet is a 
powerful force that has shaped 
the individual identities of all 
of us, whether or not we realize 
it. Growing up in the age of the 
internet has exposed us young 
people to endless content that 
has impacted the way we live 
and, more specifically, the way 
we create art. Juliana Huxtable, 
an 
American 
artist, 
writer, 
performer, DJ and co-founder 
of the New York-based nightlife 
project Shock Value, seems to 
understand it better than any of 
us. Huxtable’s performance at the 
Lydia Mendelssohn theatre last 
Wednesday invited the audience 
to “contemplate the power and 
powerlessness of the body as well 
as its dispossession in relation 
to 
technology, 
violence 
and 
blackness.” 
As soon as Huxtable began 
to speak, I immediately thought 
of a quote from the popular 
film, “Juno”: “You’re the coolest 
person I’ve ever met, and you 
don’t even try.” On days when I’m 
particularly lucky, I meet someone 
and think exactly this. There are 
people in this world that are so 
effortlessly cool that it seems to be 
a genetic trait they’ve inherited, 
like hair color or height. Huxtable 

is a perfect example of this 
effortless coolness. The energy of 
the Lydia Mendelssohn Theatre 
that night was that of a New York 
City nightclub. Huxtable and her 
entourage seemed to illuminate a 
swanky, “relax, enjoy and let me 
take you on a journey” vibe that I 
was excited to experience.
I had previously been exposed 
to Huxtable’s work in an art 
installation 
at 
the 
UMMA’s 
exhibit, “Art in the Age of the 
Internet, 1989 to Today.” After 
the exhibit, I was impressed by 
her understanding of the history 
of the internet and its impact on 
culture and art. I expected her 
performance to touch on similar 
themes. During this concert, it 
was apparent that these themes 
seemed to be a driving force in 
her work.
Huxtable 
has 
complex 
thoughts about the internet and 
the way it influences various — but 
particularly Black — identities. 
Rather than a performance, I’d go 
so far as to label this event as a live 
art installation. The evening was 
filled with mixed media, including 
lighting, projections, music and 
spoken word poetry that brought 
to light Huxtable’s thoughts on 
the perception and presentation 
of identity, history and online 
communities. I was immediately 
impressed by the lighting design 
created by Michael Potvin that 
was 
exploding 
throughout 
the theatre. Potvin’s lighting 
techniques were as complex as 
the words being spoken on the 
stage. With each different shade 
and varying projection, I was 
reminded of the brilliance that lay 
behind the lighting board.

In addition to the lighting, I was 
enchanted by the music of both 
Joe Heffernan and Ahya Simone. 
It was constructed in such a way 
that instead of overpowering 
Huxtable’s 
spoken 
word, 
it 
complimented 
it. 
Her 
words 
were an additional instrument to 
the music that was moving and 
reshaping the members of the 
audience. Huxtable’s rhythmic 
speaking voice over the equally 
rhythmic tunes allowed the music 
to be more than easy listening. 
It pushed audience members to 
question and analyze what they 
were hearing on stage, rather 
than accept the role of a simple 
bystander.
Yes, 
Huxtable 
and 
the 
rest of her entourage have a 
sort of untouchable coolness 
surrounding their art, but they 
also 
have 
a 
very 
accessible 
message that audience members 
need to hear. While the constant 
shaping and reshaping of our 
world 
by 
the 
internet 
and 
technology can be a very beautiful 
thing, there are also some dangers 
that lie within it. Remaining 
overly aware of every act you 
take on the internet, of your own 
privilege and of your art that the 
internet influences is immensely 
important. In times when the 
pursuit of truthful media is dire, 
it’s important that the media we 
contribute to is honest. There 
is no time to sit idly as forces of 
unknowable danger are forever 
shifting 
the 
information 
we 
consume. Huxtable is a great 
example of an artist that uses 
her talents and knowledge to 
not simply promote, but directly 
partake in positive social change.

crossroads of race, culture

EVENT REVIEW

ALIX CURNOW
Daily Arts Writer

Tim Johnston opens his book 
with a Hemingway quote: “He 
whispered this last so low that it 
was inaudible to anyone who did 
not love you.” It’s short. Poignant. 
Tinged with melancholy. The 
book is the same way. Slow and 
sure. If you mouth the quote, you 
almost want to elongate each 
vowel, to taste each word. Each 
word is like a snowflake, intricate. 
Each word you want to inspect.
The cover of “The Current” 
features 
big, 
blocky 
letters, 
encompassing a third of the 
space of the dark background 
and cracked with ice. It 
gives off the impression that 
“The Current” is an eerie 
book. Even the title itself 
has a shadow of something 
malignant — The Current. 
The simplicity has ominous 
connotations. The novel itself, 
however, never delivers on the 
cover’s implications. It moves at 
a snail’s pace for over half of the 
book.
The book is told in five parts, 
but it feels more like three. The 
first part reads like a chapter in 
its brevity (just over 20 pages). 
It concludes with the mysterious 
death of a girl in the river, an 
event then used as a springboard 
to investigate an eerily similar 
death of another girl ten years 
back. We’re offered a glimpse 
of Caroline’s perspective, the 
more recent of the two young 
women to plunge into the icy, 

black river. We’re able to watch 
her relationship blossom with 
Audrey, 
an 
ex-roommate, 
through relatable college scenes 
and rich prose. It culminates with 
an infraction between a Caroline 
and a professor that rings heavy 
under 
the 
recent 
#MeToo 
movement. 
The 
first 
part, 
exactly 23 pages, of Caroline and 
Audrey’s impromptu decision 
to visit Audrey’s father in small-
town Minnesota deceptively sets 
up the novel to be a fast-paced 
thriller that never delivers. I 
kept waiting — 100, 200 pages in 
— to return to that initial heart-
elevating rush.

Instead, in part two, I’m 
yanked out of my exhilaration, 
the gnawing curiosity of the 
young woman’s death — was it 
murder? — and sped back into the 
past. The second part is the story 
of the small Minnesota town. Its 
structure is confusing. A quarter 
of the way through, I realized the 
plot was alternating between past 
and present. The recent death 
of one of the aforementioned 
college girls revives memories of 
another girl’s mysterious death 
10 years earlier. The continual 
change in perspective, both in 
time and characters, makes it 

hard to immerse into the book 
completely. It’s a chore to pick 
the “The Current” up again after 
I’ve set it down, knowing that I 
have to acquaint myself with new 
characters and a new mystery.
The story is redeemed with 
lovely 
writing 
like, 
“I 
was 
underwater looking up at them 
from below. Like everyone was 
upside down. The sky, the water. 
Everything.” 
The 
repetition 
and sparse sentences have a 
rhythmic 
quality, 
mirroring 
the Hemingway quote in the 
opening. The lyrical prose makes 
it hard not to get attached to each 
character, to the small town — 
their stories and their lives and 
the difference that ten years 
make.
The third part attempts to 
tie the two deaths together. 
Despite the jarring difference 
between them, there’s a thread 
of coalescence that makes for a 
satisfying ending. It acts as an 
award for the readers that paid 
close attention from the start.
The book does not stand on 
its own as a thriller — the pacing 
is too slow, and the novel is 
stretched out unnecessarily to 
ever binge. Still, “The Current” 
differentiates itself from other 
suspenseful 
thrillers 
exactly 
because of that. Each character, 
however minor, plays a pivotal 
role in the small town. You can’t 
help but mourn the tragedy 
of another young girl 10 years 
before. You can’t help but cheer 
the characters on, reading the 
last few lines and wishing that 
everything will be OK.

‘The Current’ meanders 
with clear, certain beauty

‘The Current’

Before 10 minutes passed, 
“The Kid Who Would Be King” 
lets you know what it stands for. 
Dictators and strongmen have 
risen to power. People are more 
divided than they have ever 
been. The world is in danger 
not just from without but from 
within. The words “Brexit” and 
“Trump” are never spoken — the 
better for director Joe Cornish 
(“Attack the Block”) to ensure the 
timelessness of his film — but the 
ways in which the film mirrors 
the present couldn’t be more clear. 
It’s an unempathetic world, 
getting more so by the 
second and it would be easy 
for anyone, perhaps most of 
all children, to surrender to 
that cynicism and give up 
all hope for the future.
But 
that’s 
not 
what 
Cornish does with “The 
Kid Who Would Be King,” and 
it’s because of the optimism his 
film wields like Excalibur that, 
whatever its flaws, I believe it to 
be an important story — one that 
not only deserves to be told but 
needs to be told. The world can be 
unfeeling and cruel, but “The Kid 
Who Would Be King” explains to 
its young audience that they don’t 
have to be, and in its sincerity, it 
may remind adults of the same 
thing.
The movie follows young Alex 
Elliott (Louis Ashbourne Serkis, 
“Taboo”), a boy living in England 

who finds himself attacked every 
day by bullies while he does his 
best to just make it through the 
day. Everything changes when 
Alex finds and draws a sword 
from a stone, only to learn that 
it’s Excalibur — “The Kid Who 
Would Be King” plays it forgivably 
fast and loose with Arthurian 
mythology — and that he’s the 
descendant of King Arthur. No 
sooner has he discovered his 
heritage than he learns that he 
only has four days to prepare 
himself and his friends for the 
arrival of Morgana (Rebecca 
Ferguson, “Mission: Impossible – 
Fallout”), an evil sorceress bent on 

subjecting the world to her will.
Even setting aside the bracing 
optimism 
at 
its 
core, 
“The 
Kid Who Would Be King” is 
admirable for how it encourages 
its adolescent viewers to identify 
with its characters even at the 
darkest moments of their quest. 
No one on screen is portrayed as 
perfect and each of them wrestle 
with demons of their own, yet this 
doesn’t stop them from becoming 
heroes. It would have been all too 
easy to make Alex’s schoolyard 
tormentors into one-dimensional 
villains, but despite feints in that 

direction, Cornish keeps the 
humanity of each of his characters 
front and center.
This goes for the battle scenes 
as well; multiple times throughout 
the film, Alex and co. feel like 
they’re in real danger, thanks 
mostly to the superb design work 
on Morgana and her minions. 
The action suffers in other areas, 
particularly in its disappointingly 
mundane depiction of magic — a 
half-baked series of snaps and 
claps that actively drains the 
stakes the more it shows up — but 
it’s doubtful kids in the audience 
will pay these weaker parts much 
mind afforded the opportunity 
to see young people like 
themselves actually treated 
as heroes in their own right.
And as if the message 
couldn’t be any clearer, an 
elderly Merlin (a delightful 
Sir 
Patrick 
Stewart, 
“Logan”) all but says it 
outright: “It will eventually 
fall to today’s children to push 
society forward, and to do so, 
they’ll need to work together and 
to actively forge empathy where 
there otherwise is none.” So, 
would I argue that “The Kid Who 
Would Be King” could use maybe 
another pass or two on its script, 
that one of the characters exists 
solely to recount what’s already 
happened and that it’s about 15 
minutes too long? Yes, but that’s 
almost beside the point. If the next 
generation will be learning from 
films like this, then maybe there’s 
a reason to be optimistic.

‘The Kid Who Would Be 
King’ is imperfect, needed

FILM REVIEW

20TH CENTURY FOX

JEREMIAH VANDERHELM
Daily Arts Writer

‘The Kid Who 
Would be King’

20th Century Fox

I’ve got an idea for television’s 
next comedy sensation: Quirky, 
attractive, 
primarily 
white 
singles kind of struggling — 
but more often drinking — in 
New York (read: Manhattan 
or Brooklyn, NOT the Bronx). 
Now, if this sounds like every 
sitcom 
or 
comedy-
drama ever made, that’s 
because it is. The image 
of the college-educated, 
20-something trying to 
“make it” in New York 
is so ingrained in the 
American psyche that 
it has basically become 
the definition of what 
it means to be in your 
20s. This relationship 
between New York and 
the comedy genre has 
birthed so many nearly-
identical offspring that 
any show with these 
characteristics must be 
exceptionally special to 
pique my interest. “Will 
and Grace,” currently 
midway through the second 
season of its series reboot, is not 
proving to be interesting enough 
to distinguish itself from the 
pack 
of 
New 
York-centric 
content.
“Will and Grace” is like the 
middle child of the New York 
comedy — respected enough, 
but clearly holding onto the past 

in the hopes of one day being 
discussed in the same breath as 
the “golden child” of the New 
York comedies, “Friends.”
It would be unfair to make 
the claim that “Will and Grace” 
does 
not 
depart 
from 
the 
formulaic cliche of the “straight 
attractive singles” comedy, as 
two of the central characters are 
gay men. Sadly, the freshness 
stops there. Watching this show 

feels like watching off-brand 
“Friends” or “Sex and the City,” 
or the millions of other shows 
like it. There’s the proverbial 
laugh track for lines that can 
be funny, depending on who 
you ask. The environment looks 
flat because you know they’re 
shooting it in a studio, and worst 
of all, the characters are almost 

completely unrecognizable.
That’s the thing about New 
York comedies: The person they 
are trying to portray doesn’t 
really exist, and if they do they 
certainly don’t have nearly as 
much free time as the characters 
in these shows do. The honest 
truth is that being young and 
single in New York, or any big 
city, does not guarantee that you 
will live a quirky, romanticized, 
socially active life. It’s 
more mundane, sleep-
deprived 
and 
lonely 
than the media portrays. 
Yet, 
comedy 
can 
be 
found in this bleakness 
and real genuine humor 
can be made from these 
realities. However, in 
shows like “Will and 
Grace,” this humor is 
nowhere to be found. 
“Will and Grace” instead 
clings to a fantasy where 
studio 
apartments 
in 
Manhattan 
grow 
on 
trees. 
The 
relationship 
between New York and 
comedy isn’t a bad thing. 
There is a sliver of truth 
to the fantasy, but I just wish the 
content wasn’t so misleading. 
As I progress through college, 
imagining my life after school 
is becoming more and more 
pertinent. It’s not an easy 
transition for anybody, and right 
now, televised comedy is only 
building expectations that I 
know will let me down.

When I was 10 years old, my 
dad threw out our toaster. To 
replace it, he cleared about 80 
percent of our counter space for 
a large, steel industrial panini 
press. Suddenly, our kitchen 
felt less like our homey space 
and more like the industrial 
kitchens of restaurants. Growing 
up, my friends came over and 
ogled over the machine: the 
centerpiece of our kitchen, the 
shining star of our counter space, 
the replacement for the rusted, 
old toaster. From that day on, 
everything from toaster waffles 
to grilled cheese was made in 
the press, and thus began my 
training as a panini connoisseur. 
Initially, I was a bit intimidated. 
What could this panini press do 
that my old toaster or a skillet 
with some butter 
couldn’t have done? 
How would I use 
it? When would I 
approach it? 
A panini, or more 
authentically 
the 
“panino,” is a grilled 
sandwich 
made 
with Italian bread 
such 
as 
ciabatta 
or 
michetta. 
My 
parents 
never 
grocery 
shopped 
for 
snacks 
like 
Oreos and Goldfish, 
but they did always 
make sure we had 
ciabatta bread, an 
array 
of 
artisan 
cheeses and other 
accoutrements 
to 
engineer 
our 
perfect after school 
breakfast, 
lunch 
or dinner paninos. 
Paninos became a 
staple of my every 
day life, a constant 
challenge I looked 
forward to. I took 
to 
popping 
any 
odd 
combination 
or faithful classic 
in 
the 
press 
that 
I 
could 
engineer from the 
ingredients in our 
fridge, from fig jam, 
brie 
and 
turkey 
on 
cinnamon 
bread to braciole, 
parmigiana 
and 
honey 
on 
crispy 
baguette, to peanut 
butter, banana and 
jelly on a baguette 
— 
everything 
and 
anything 
was 
willing 
to 
transform 
magically 
and 
deliciously in the 
panini press. 
The panino dates 
back to 16th century 
Italian cookbooks; 
however, 
the 
sandwiches became 
trendy in Milanese 
bars in the 1960s. 
In the 1980s the 
term 
paninaro 
arose in Italy with 
the rise of youth 
culture represented 

by patrons of sandwich bars 
in Milan. With the addition of 
our panini press, my kitchen 
transformed 
into 
a 
Milano 
panini shop, and my brothers 
and I transformed into the young 
paninaros of suburban New 
Jersey. On any given weekday or 
weekend afternoon, you could 
find us huddled in our kitchen as 
salty cheese melted and spilled 
over the sides of homemade bread 
and hit the searing hot grill. 
When I say “panini,” the first 
thing that comes to your mind 
might be a toasted baguette, a 
thick slab of mozzarella cheese, 
juicy, slightly sweet tomatoes 

and slices of basil, all stacked 
and grilled to perfection and 
served with balsamic reduction 
or grassy pesto. While the typical 
“caprese” panini is for sure a 
fan favorite and always one I’m 
willing to have a bite or two of, it’s 
a bit basic. Ever since my father 
came home and ceremonially 
threw away our dingy toaster, 
I’ve been on the pursuit to the 
more unique, more idiosyncratic 
flavors that trump those of the 
mundane “caprese” sandwich. 
Through my panini journey, 
I hope you’ll feel inspired to 
ransack your fridge, hit the 
grocery store and start on your 
own unique paninis — there is so 
much more to the space between 
two slices of plain bread than we 
expect. A sandwich is typically 
seen as the lazy person’s meal, 
the regular, old lunch or the 
boring, easy snack. But the panini 
changes all of that — it transforms 
a cold, basic sandwich into the 
crispy, crunchy, warm handheld 
queen of all foods, kicking aside 
Wonder Bread, ham and cheese 
for a prosciutto, provolone and 
sweet pear panini on fresh, 
dream-like ciabatta. 
Good Italian bread is where 
it all starts. My father always 
told me that bread is the key to 
success in a panini: The minute 
the bread is soggy, slightly 
stale or just bad in general, the 
sandwich goes down with it. The 
bread is the anchor of the whole 
ship: It ensures that the juice and 
sauce stay soaked into the moist 
space in the puffy bread without 
turning it soggy. You cannot have 
panini success without ciabatta 
success. The key to good ciabatta, 
you ask? It’s actually quite 
simple, despite what one might 
think. It’s made from wheat flour, 

water, salt, olive oil and yeast. 
Paying good attention to how 
long it should rise and bake is 
important, but the rest is rather 
simple. If the bread is perfect, the 
other ingredients can take center 
stage and shine. 
My flavor muse is my uncle 
Bobby. He knows flavor like 
no other and can always pair 
the most unlikely ingredients 
together to make the most 
gastronomically pleasing dishes. 
While pondering the perfect 
sandwich to share with you all, I 
decided to call him. I knew that 
he would have had a homemade 
panini recently, as a fellow 
panini scientist, and I knew he’d 
immediately be able to speak on 
the most distinctive, individual 
sandwich possible. He said he’d 
get back to me, as the call took 
place early in the morning, and 
he hadn’t had lunch yet. 
The anticipation nearly killed 
me. 
When he called me back, the 
first thing he said was, “spicy 
pickled chicken panini,” and I 
was immediately intrigued. He 
told me the process of making the 
simple, spicy sandwich: 
Chicken thighs brined in spicy 
Grillo’s pickle juice. Trust him on 
this one. He is a flavor god. (“Plan 
ahead! A one day brine with dark, 
juicy meat is the best!”)
Bread and then pan fry the 
chicken thighs to a crispy, 
crunchy golden brown. (“Batter 
in 
eggs 
and 
Panko 
bread 
crumbs”)
Use a crusty roll with light, 
chewy insides for the perfect 
happy medium. (“Top secret, it 
holds all the juice in!”)
Top with mayonnaise, red 
wine vinegar, thin slices of red 
onion and Grillo spicy Italian 
pickle chips for added flavor. 
Press for five minutes — here’s 
where the press comes in! (“Half 
crunch, half chew!”)
After 
making 
it 
myself, 
the result certainly does not 
disappoint. This panini is a jack 
of all trades: It’s creamy, spicy, 
crunchy, chewy and salty all at 
once. While the flavors could 
seem distracting, they somehow 
come together in a serendipitous 
moment of crispy perfection. 
Bobby’s review seems to sum it 
up perfectly for me:
“Crunch… yes! Chew… yes! 
Salty… yes! Spicy… yes! Fatty & 
creamy & delicious… yes!”
The special thing about paninis 
is that they are so much more 
than just separate ingredients: in 
one bite you can have the whole 
world on your palate as flavors 
that you never imagined combine 
and blend. No other food in the 
world is at once so simple and so 
complex, so manageable and so 
high maintenance.
Like I said, the caprese is a fan 
favorite, but it is overdone and 
much too basic for the millions 
of possibilities that can nestle 
between two slices of perfect, 
fresh bread. Let that crunchy 
ciabatta try on some different 
dressings. Be creative — with 
a blank canvas of fresh, soft 
bread you are an artist. Once you 
open your fridge and turn that 
panini press on high heat, the 
possibilities are simply endless. 

The pursuit of the 
perfect panini

DAILY FOOD COLUMN

ELI RALLO

“Velvet Buzzsaw,” a hot mess 
of high art horror-satire from 
Netflix, is the absolute best 
kind of bad movie. Written 
and directed by Dan Gilroy 
(“Nightcrawler”), the film is 
such a nebulous rollercoaster 
of jumbled ideas and characters 
that there is not one dull 
moment throughout. It works 
so unintentionally well because 
it balances a viewer’s reactions 
between “What am I watching?” 
and “This is so ridiculous I can’t 
stop.”
Jake Gyllenhaal (“Wildlife”) 
plays a cynical, cheeky art 
critique with the meticulously 
lazy bangs and thin black wire-
rimmed glasses to match. To 
complete the caricature, 
think of the most over-
the-top art critique name 
you can. Do you have it? 
I have a better one: Morf 
Vandewalt. His character 
faces dark and paranormal 
consequences when an agent, 
Josephina 
(Zawe 
Ashton, 
“Nocturnal Animals”), steals 
the 
paintings 
of 
recently 
deceased artist Ventril Dease 
and begins to sell them. To be 
fair, the plot is hardly the draw 
of “Buzzsaw.” Every single line 
of dialogue in this movie is 
so breathlessly written that I 
actually started making a list of 
Morf’s most memorable verbal 
ruminations. You will discover 
some of them below.
To quote from Vandewalt, 
“A bad review is better than 
sinking into the great glut of 
anonymity.” He’s right. And as a 
staunch advocate for the power 
of bad movies, I cannot let this 
one go unnoticed. Truthfully, 
it would be easy to tear this 
movie apart for what it is. But 
I can’t. The reason is that, 
unlike in so many bad movies, 

the cast and crew of “Buzzsaw” 
seem completely genuine in 
their effort. Nothing is awarely 
awful about the movie, and 
yet everything is laughable. 
It’s a precarious Jenga tower 
of scenes that don’t at all cut 
together, 
two-dimensional, 
inexplicably fickle characters 
and perplexing plotting that 
appears to have even escaped 
the understanding of its author. 
For all these things “Buzzsaw” 
deserves 
far 
more 
than 
a 
rudimentary rant.
I’ll again allow Vandewalt’s 
wisdom to guide me: “Critique 
is so limiting and emotionally 
draining. I’ve always wanted to 
do something long form, dip my 
toes into an exploration of origin 
and essence. A metamorphosis 
of spirit into reality.” Whatever 
that means.

In the name of dipping my 
toes into an exploration of 
origin and essence, here are 
some of my most noteworthy 
observations 
from 
“Velvet 
Buzzsaw”: The most fitting 
metaphor to describe the film is 
that it centers around dumpster 
paintings for which the entire 
art 
community 
immediately 
clamors. 
“They’re 
visionary, 
mesmeric,” Vandewalt admits 
immediately after a once-over. 
While the Dease collection 
becomes 
the 
next 
hottest 
collection in the pretentious 
and stuffy world of art buyers, 
the group that Gilroy fails to sell 
on his own art is the audience of 
the film.
The movie frantically leaps 
around genres to such an extent 
that I’m not sure what was 
intentionally funny and what 
wasn’t. Although the finale 

does play out like the ending of 
a slasher movie and surely was 
not meant to evoke laughter, I 
couldn’t help but crack up at 
the entire sequence. At times, 
art gala owners turn into 
professional investigators on a 
whim and banal love triangles 
appear out of thin air. It’s 
glorious.
The 
denouement 
of 
“Buzzsaw” 
is 
intentionally 
open-ended, 
unwilling 
to 
divulge the specific mechanics 
of 
the 
ghostly 
apparitions 
that haunt its periphery. To 
me, the actual reason for this 
ambiguity was that there was 
no legitimate way to explain 
any of the events in the film to 
begin with. Oh yeah, and John 
Malkovich appears in the end 
credits drawing lines of sand on 
a beach with a wooden stick. He 
was in the movie at some 
point. I think.
Given 
my 
aforementioned 
belief 
in the importance of bad 
movies, I cannot stress 
how important it is to see 
this one. It is as fun to discuss 
with others as it is to watch, a 
hollow interpretation of high 
art that only reaffirms to me 
that bad movies can be art after 
all. But, alas, I cannot do my 
own words justice. There’s only 
one man who can. My favorite 
Morf quote describes both his 
own convictions and mine in 
reviewing this movie: “This 
is my life. How I connect with 
some sort of spirituality. I assess 
out of adoration. I further the 
realm I analyze.”
Say what you will about 
the forgettability of “Velvet 
Buzzsaw” in the vast abyss 
of Netflix misfires, but Morf 
Vandewalt 
is 
an 
inspiring 
idea of a man. His movie may 
have failed, but he did indeed 
convince me to further the 
realm I analyze. So thanks, 
Morf.

‘Velvet Buzzsaw’ is an 
enjoyable camp atrocity

Bench sparks Michigan

There are few things that 
can be the difference between 
winning or losing a basketball 
game. The Michigan women’s 
basketball team has one of 
them down: bench play.
“The 
way 
that 
they’ve 
been able to play has been 
the difference between us 
being successful, and early on 
in league play, us not being 
successful,” 
said 
Michigan 
head coach Kim Barnes Arico 
after the team’s 67-61 win over 
Nebraska on Thursday.
The Wolverines’ second unit 
has come through time and 
time again to help them win 
games late. Freshman forward 
Naz Hillmon, who is the 
team’s leading 
scorer 
with 
13.2 
points 
per game, has 
routinely been 
Michigan’s 
go-to 
scoring 
option late in 
contests, 
and 
junior forward 
Kayla Robbins 
continues to be 
a 
rebounding 
and defensive force. Junior 
guard 
Akienreh 
Johnson 
has also begun to emerge, 
highlighted by her standout 
performance against Nebraska 
in which she tallied 14 points 
and six steals.
 In Sunday’s win against 
Penn 
State, 
Barnes 
Arico 
turned to her bench once 
again. The team’s second unit 
would need to produce in 
the absence freshman point 
guard Amy Dilk and with 
senior forwards Hallie Thome 
and Nicole Munger already 
limited with injuries of their 
own. Freshman forward Emily 
Kiser, as well as freshman 
guards Danielle Rauch and 
Ariel 
Young, 
played 
solid 
defense during a late stretch 
at the end of the first half to 
help Michigan hold onto a 
slim one-point lead. Hillmon 
was her usual dominant self 

with a 19-point performance 
off the pine and Robbins 
dominated the glass with eight 
rebounds, including three on 
the offensive end.
On a night where just two 
Wolverines scored in double 
figures and senior forward 
Hallie Thome failed to register 
a field goal, the Wolverine 
bench was able to hold the 
Lady Lions in check and make 
enough plays to help keep its 
winning streak intact.
With Thome suffering from 
a lingering back injury and 
Dilk’s status uncertain after 
sustaining an injury against 
Nebraska, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
bench production has been 
more important than ever 
during its recent four-game 
surge. That’s especially so 
considering 
that the team 
is 
currently 
fighting 
for 
its 
NCAA 
Tournament 
life, 
currently 
projected as one 
of the first four 
teams to be left 
out, 
according 
to 
ESPN’s 
Charlie Creme. 
With little margin for error, 
the bench hasn’t always been 
perfect, but they’ve made the 
plays Michigan has needed to 
pull out four consecutive close 
wins. 
“Thank god for the depth,” 
Barnes Arico said. “Because if 
we didn’t have the depth that 
we did coming into the year 
we’d be in a predicament right 
now.”
While Michigan’s ultimate 
goal lies in March, it is 
currently focused on what it 
can accomplish in the month 
of February. Despite a slew 
of injuries, the team has 
continued to fight and take the 
season one game at a time, in a 
large part because its reserves 
have stepped up. The result? 
The Wolverines’ best stretch 
of the season thus far.
“February’s 
our 
month,” 
Akienreh Johnson said.

Wolverines perform well over weekend meets

Two weeks ago at Boston 
University, 
Chase 
Barnett 
and Ben Hill nearly broke 
four minutes in the mile. 
This weekend, they fell short 
again — only this time, the 
experienced distance runners 
didn’t come quite as close, 
with Barnett falling behind 
late to finish 4:05.14 and Hill 
at 4:08.26.
Barnett 
and 
Hill 
were 
among 
the 
distance 
runners 
of 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 
track 
and field team 
who 
traveled 
to Ames, Iowa 
for 
the 
Iowa 
State 
Classic, 
while 
the 
throwers, 
jumpers 
and 
sprinters went to Nashville, 
Tenn. for Vanderbilt’s Music 
City Challenge. While the 
Wolverines 
failed 
to 
meet 
their full potential in the mile, 
there were a host of strong 
performances and personal-
best records in both of the 
non-scoring meets to build 

off of as the team prepares for 
the upcoming Big Ten Indoor 
Championships, which will be 
hosted in Ann Arbor.
“We got done what we 
wanted to get done there in 
Nashville,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach Jerry Clayton. “And 
coach 
(Kevin) 
Sullivan’s 
group had some really good 
races there at Iowa State, so I 
thought that we’re where we 
need to be right now. But we 
still got to step it up at the Big 
Ten.”
Sophomore 
Jack 
Aho 
impressed 
on 
Friday at Iowa 
State 
as 
he 
competed 
in 
the 5000-meter 
race 
for 
the 
first time this 
season, coming 
in just short of 
the 
14-minute 
threshold at 14:02.28. Aho 
got off to a blazing start, but 
failed to keep pace with the 
leading pack the rest of the 
way. Finishing in 12th place, 
his performance earned him 
the 11th-best time in Michigan 
history in the event.
Freshman Will Landowne 
hung around in the middle of 

his heat in the 3000-meter 
race, catching up to finish 
in third place and earning a 
personal-best time of 8:17.14.
Two 
other 
Wolverines 
gained 
new 
personal-best 
times as well in the same 
event. 
Sophomores 
Lewis 
Tate and Christian Hubaker 
finished at 8:21.92 and 8:21.00, 
respectively.
While 
both 
meets 
were 
non-scoring, several Michigan 
athletes placed well in their 
events 
at 
the 
Music 
City 
Challenge. 
The 
throwers 
in 
particular 
left their mark 
on 
the 
final 
scoresheet, and 
very nearly in 
their 
school’s 
record 
books, 
against 
strong 
competition. 
Fifth-year senior Josh Ellis 
had the best performance of 
his season in the weight throw, 
launching the 35-pound ball 
23.56 meters, a throw that 
pushed him to second in the 
country in the weight throw. 
He finished second behind 
former Wolverine teammate 
Grant 
Cartwright. 
Senior 

Andrew 
Liskowitz 
finished 
third in shot put with a 19.62 
meter throw that was just two 
centimeters short of breaking 
his own indoor school record 
that he set in January.
“Of course Joe and Andrew 
have been pretty consistent 
all year,” Clayton said. “But 
for them to improve on their 
performances and then to do 
it under very good competition 
— that probably was the best 
weight competition of the 
weekend 
of 
anywhere 
in 
the nation, and 
the shot wasn’t 
far behind. And 
that’s why we 
wanted to get 
them there to 
get them that 
opportunity 
to go against 
those type of 
people.”
Hurdlers Roland Amarteifio 
and Sierra Hendrix-Williams 
were a potent duo in the 
60-meter hurdles. Both beat 
their own personal records 
in the finals, with respective 
times 
of 
7.91 
and 
7.97. 
Amarteifio finished in second 
— .18 seconds short of first 
place — and Hendrix-Williams 
came in fourth.
“I thought the hurdler races 
went really well,” Clayton said. 
“Those guys really dropped 
their 
(personal 
record) 
… 
really a lot of positive things 
there.”
The two weekend meets 
were the last major ones of 
the regular season, before 
Michigan 
brings 
a 
small 
squad to Notre Dame next 
week before the Big Ten 
Championships on Feb. 22-23. 
Most of the team will have 
a 
chance 
to 
recover, 
and 
the coaches will focus on 
finalizing their strategy for 
the conference championship 
and making sure their athletes 
are ready.
“It’s basically going back, 
tweaking things a little bit this 
week,” Clayton said. “And then 
next week it’s time to come out 
and showtime after that.”

Sophomores ready to lead in 2019

Last season was baptism by fire 
for the freshmen of the Michigan 
baseball team.
After the 2017 season concluded, 
seven of the Wolverines signed 
MLB contracts, a figure that led the 
nation, and thus created a void in 
the lineup. This year’s sophomore 
class was forced into action last 
season and is looking to build on 
that experience.
“The storyline of this team, 
I think, is guys who have been 
patient in our program that have 
waited their turn, so to speak,” 
said Michigan coach Erik Bakich. 
“I don’t envision a whole lot of 
newcomers emerging on the scene 
like we had last year. Last year the 
situation presented itself. We led 
the nation in draft picks the year 
before, after the 2017 season. We 
had 11 guys drafted, seven of them 
were juniors, all seven juniors 
signed. So the opportunity was 
there for freshmen to earn starting 
jobs.”
Last 
season, 
sophomore 
outfielders Jesse Franklin and 
Jordan Nwogu were two of the 
top batters in the lineup. Franklin 
batted .327 with a team-leading 47 
RBIs, while Nwogu was third in 
batting average at .349. Franklin 
had the best fielding percentage 
on the team at .991 (minimum 
50 attempts) last season. The 
Wolverines 
will 
need 
that 

production to return along with 
their stellar defense in order to win 
the Big Ten for the first time since 
2008.
“I see just a little bit of an older 
team, so I see a group of kids who’ve 
had another birthday, who’ve 
gotten stronger, who’ve become 
more physical,” Bakich said. “So I 
would like to think we’re capable 
of hitting for more power this year.”
Bakich clearly expects more 
from all of his returning players. 
The amount of playing time for last 
season’s freshman was unusual, 
not only for the program, but 
nationally.
“Looking around the field, those 
spots just aren’t quite as available 
because we do have some returning 
starters back. But every position is 
rented in our program,” Bakich 
said. “Just because they started 
there last year doesn’t mean they’re 
entitled to the position this year. 
They have to go out there and earn 
it again, and a lot of them have.”
The pair of outfielders may have 
been solid, but Michigan struggled 
with consistency all season. They 
started out 2-10 before rattling 
off 20 consecutive wins. The 
Wolverines then dropped five of 
their last six regular-season games 
before bowing out in the second 
round of the Big Ten Tournament.
On paper, the expectations are 
high because of the invaluable 
experience gained in the prior 
season. But, a lot can go wrong 
in a season, and the pillars of 

this program are its defense and 
pitching. Sophomore pitchers Jeff 
Criswell and Angelo Smith are 
expected to contribute more as 
starters this year after pitching in 
relief last year. This is partially due 
to the fact that sophomore pitcher 
Ben Dragani is out for the year 
after having Tommy John surgery. 
Dragani was one of Michigan’s best 
on the mound last season.
“Angelo Smith had a great ERA 
last year and pitched just in some 
relief roles and some matchup 
roles,” Bakich said. “He was a 
matchup left-hander pitching in 
some short relief appearances, but 
he’s a guy that could be pitching at 
the end of games for us because he’s 
a year better.
“A guy like Jeff Criswell, who 
pitched for us in relief last year, he’s 
been working as a starter this fall 
and preseason, he looks very good. 
He’s got one of the best arms on 
the team. He throws in the mid to 
upper 90s, he’s got a lightning bolt 
for an arm and he’s looking very 
good.”
After an up and down 2018 
season, 
the 
Wolverines 
seem 
poised for success in 2019 thanks 
to the return of a strong sophomore 
class.
“Everything feels right, in terms 
of what type of group this could 
be,” Bakich said. “It feels like a 
special group, so we’ll have to make 
sure we stay at the front end of any 
potential threats and keep these 
guys moving in the right direction.”

For ‘M,’ an enchanted performance

There was magic in the air.
The Crisler Center was full 
of magic Sunday, in part to the 
“enchanted” 
theme 
during 
the No. 10 Michigan women’s 
gymnastics 
team’s 
(4-0 
Big 
Ten, 8-2 overall) meet against 
Iowa (1-3 Big Ten, 2-5 overall), 
but also in part to the dazzling 
performance and heroic efforts of 
the Wolverines.
Along with the Disney sing-a-
longs and dance contests, there 
were plenty of impressive flips 
and feats to entertain the crowd.
Michigan defeated Iowa with 
a season-high score of 197.350 
to 195.350. Michigan was led by 
freshman Natalie Wojcik, who 
earned her fifth all-around with a 
39.550, followed by senior Olivia 
Karas with a score of 39.250.
The meet began with the 
Wolverines at vault and the 
Hawkeyes on bars. Freshman 
Abby Brenner posted the highest 
score of the meet with a 9.850. 
Wojcik and sophomore Anne 
Maxim were right there too with 
a 9.825 and 9.800, respectively. 
Karas and junior Maddy Osman 

rounded out the scoring with a 
9.775 and a 9.750, respectively, 
bringing the Wolverines to a 
49.000 to 48.950 lead.
The second event saw the two 
teams switch events. Michigan 
excelled at the uneven bars, 
posting two scores at 9.950, from 
Karas and Wojcik. There were 
also high scores of 9.875 from 
both freshman Maddie Mariani 
and Brenner in addition to a 9.850 
from sophomore Lauren Farley. 
At the end of the second event, 
the Wolverines had extended 
their lead to make it 98.500 to 
97.775.
Leaving the bars and the 
vault behind, the third event saw 
Michigan on the balance beam 
and Iowa on the floor exercise. 
Junior Lexi Funk shined on the 
beam, posting the meet-high 
score of 9.950. Wojcik and Farley 
weren’t far behind with scores of 
9.925 and 9.900, respectively, and 
Osman and Karas each earned 
a score of 9.825 to round out the 
scoring for the beam. 
Coming into the fourth and 
final event, chants of “Let’s Go 
Blue” could be heard from the 
crowd. Now up 147.975 to 146.875, 
the Wolverines encouraged the 

crowd to cheer more and joined in 
on the chants themselves. Coach 
Bev Plocki noted how important 
crowd energy is to Michigan.
“It’s been great this year, it 
really has been,” Plocki said. “I 
always want more, but I’ve been 
happy with our crowds and the 
event staff has been doing a great 
job of getting them involved in 
what’s going on and the energy 
has been great.”
Not only did the crowd bring 
energy, but the Michigan squad 
brought some energy themselves. 
Before the floor exercise began, 
the Wolverines huddled up to get 
amped and prepared for the final 
event.
“We just kind of remind 
ourselves to have fun and enjoy 
it,” Wojcik said. “Just go out there 
and be confident.”
With Michigan amped up, the 
team began the floor exercise. 
Karas finished for the Wolverines 
and posted the highest score of 
the meet with a 9.925. Senior 
Emma McLean, coming back 
from a shoulder injury, earned 
an impressive 9.900. Brenner, 
Wojcik and Osman had scores 
of 
9.875, 
9.850 
and 
9.825, 
respectively.

The Wolverines’ Quinn Hughes and the process of bouncing back

With 
17 
minutes 
left 
in 
Michigan’s game against Penn 
State at Madison Square Garden 
on Jan. 26, the Wolverines 
trailed 4-0.
But 
then 
sophomore 
defenseman 
Quinn 
Hughes 
fired a shot at goaltender Peyton 
Jones, and redshirt sophomore 
forward Luke Morgan was there 
to clean up the rebound and 
send it home. After 43 scoreless 
minutes, the Michigan hockey 
team was on finally the board.
A few minutes later, the 
Wolverines were on the power 
play with a chance to further 
cut into the deficit. Penn State 
was able to clear the puck down 
the ice, and Hughes was the 
defenseman assigned to bring 
the puck back into the offensive 
zone.
As the sophomore skated 
toward center ice, Hughes tried 
to send a backward pass to a 
teammate. But there was no 
one there, and forward Alex 
Limoges picked up the puck and 
sent it past a sprawling junior 
goaltender Hayden Lavigne. It 
was the Nittany Lions’ fifth and 
final goal of the night — and the 
second that came from Hughes 
giving up the puck.
“That game against Penn 
State, (Hughes) stood up in the 
locker room after the game and 
said, ‘Hey, I was Penn State’s best 
player tonight,’ ” said Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson on Saturday. 
“First, you have to own it. I 
think that’s the first thing is you 
have to own it to be able to move 
forward and make changes. And 
he’s a smart guy. He knew it, he 
knew it. I give him a lot of credit 
for standing up in front of his 
teammates and saying that.”
After completing the first 
step of taking ownership for his 
mistakes, Hughes’ next move 
was to talk with the coaching 
staff and watch film from the 
game.
Pearson 
and 
the 
rest 
of 
his staff like to watch film 
with their players early in the 
week. Hockey is a sport more 

dependent 
on 
the 
decisions 
of an individual than other 
team sports, so every Monday, 
Tuesday and Wednesday, players 
will individually file into the 
coaches’ offices for a personal 
film session.
Hughes 
sat 
down 
with 
both 
Pearson 
and 
assistant 
coach Brian Wiseman — who 
spends his time focusing on the 
defensemen — after that game 
in New York to look at Hughes’ 
performance.
“He’s a smart hockey player,” 
Pearson 
said 
Monday. 
“He 
understands the game. At times 
they weren’t — it’s nothing he 
doesn’t know and the beauty 
of it is, it’s nothing you can’t 
overcome or you can’t correct. If 
it’s something you can’t correct 
or the player continues to do it, 

then you have an issue.
“But the way he plays, we’re 
gonna let him play his game, 
just like we would any of our 
players. There’s a certain style 
we 
play 
with 
and we’re gonna 
let 
guys 
play. 
They just have 
to 
limit 
their 
major mistakes. 
You’re 
gonna 
make 
mistakes, 
but you have to 
learn from them 
and try to limit 
them.”
It’s 
easy 
to 
look at Hughes’ turnovers in 
New York and say they’re the 
result of a player trying to get 
too cute or attempting to make 
an eye-popping play.

But according to Pearson, it’s 
the exact opposite.
“The thing with him is he 
wants to win so bad,” Pearson 
said. “He’s trying to create 
opportunities 
for us. You have 
to 
understand 
that. I don’t think 
sometimes a lot 
of people maybe 
get 
that. 
They 
just want him to 
dump it in and 
stay 
back, 
and 
anybody can do 
that. But it’s not 
in his DNA, so 
now we have to work with him 
to manage the game.”
And 
since 
that 
game 
in 
New York, Hughes has clearly 
internalized what he talked 

about with his coaches and 
worked to limit his mistakes.
His effort level has visibly 
been higher, and he’s made 
impressive plays in all four 
games since. This time, his plays 
have made Michigan’s highlight 
reel — not the other team’s. 
Hughes is refocusing on the 
little things that make him 
successful, and it’s been effective 
thus far.
“As a competitor, when you 
don’t play that great, you want to 
follow up, trying to have a really 
good game and string together 
some good games,” Hughes said. 
“That’s what I think I’ve done, 
and I think that was my mindset. 
Just to — I think it was good for 
me just to refocus and get ready 
for the following weekend.”
Added Pearson: “I think he’s 

more aware defensively, more 
aware with the puck, more aware 
when he’s the last man, more 
aware when he can jump into the 
rush versus just putting himself 
in a bad position defensively. 
Being more physical, playing the 
body more. All those things.”
Bouncing back from a bad 
game is a process, and it’s not one 
that Hughes — the No. 7 overall 
draft pick in the 2018 NHL Draft 
and one of the top prospects 
in college hockey — has a lot of 
experience with.
But 
Hughes’ 
performance 
in the last four games shows 
that he’s moved on and come 
through to the other side, and 
his comments follow those same 
lines. 
“I haven’t thought about New 
York since New York.”

Jordan Poole: Don’t call it a slump

Don’t tell Jordan Poole he’s in a 
slump. At least not to his face.
“I personally don’t like to use 
the word slump. It’s a media thing,” 
the sophomore guard said last 
Monday after he shot 3-for-9 in a 
loss to Iowa. “But there’ll just be 
games where you don’t hit shots. 
… I bounce back. That’s all there is 
to it.”
Whatever term you use, it’s 
undeniable that Poole’s recent 
shooting numbers have been below 
his usual standards — something 
that 
has 
contributed 
to 
the 
Michigan men’s basketball team’s 
offensive regression in conference 
play.
Since a Jan. 3 game against Penn 
State, Poole has shot just 19-of-63 — 
30 percent — from beyond the arc. 
Though Poole’s dislike of the term 
“slump” may come down to just 
semantics, his shooting struggles 
go deeper than a simple blanket 
term.
“One of Jordan’s issues was 
where he was shooting,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
last week. “He was open, but he 
didn’t have — he didn’t need to 
be standing at the NBA line and 
shooting.”
In 
recent 
contests 
against 
Rutgers and Wisconsin, it seemed 

like maybe Poole was breaking 
through. But lost in the cheers 
after 
Poole 
drained 
a 
triple 
for Michigan’s first points of 
Saturday’s win against the Badgers 
was the fact that he still released 
the shot a few feet beyond the arc — 
the exact kind of NBA three Beilein 
wants him to avoid.
Beilein estimated that Poole has 
hit 45 percent of his shots from the 
college line in practice, but just 33 
percent from the NBA line. It’s a 
hard habit to break. After all, a shot 
is mostly muscle memory. Poole 
just gets himself open, takes the 
ball and shoots, the way he always 
has. These moments happen in a 
split second during a real game, so 
Poole has no time to look down and 
check his proximity to the arc.
Instead, to combat the problem, 
Beilein and the other coaches 
have been working with Poole to 
readjust. During a practice last 
Sunday, assistant coach DeAndre 
Haynes stood on the sideline 
behind Poole, watching to see if 
he drifted too far out. Every time 
he did, Haynes pushed him back 
toward the arc.
“It’s a hard thing,” Beilein said. 
“There’s some players with their 
GPS — it just takes time to adjust. 
I mean, they just have this feel of 
where they should be and it’s really 
hard. … And he’s not saying, ‘Heck 
with you, coach, I’m gonna stand 

over here!’ It’s the GPS thing that 
people will go through.”
The 
changes 
won’t 
come 
overnight, but if Poole continues 
to adjust his internal compass, it 
could pay dividends for him and 
the team. Meanwhile, there are 
other steps Poole has taken to put 
himself in better situations to get 
quality shots.
He’s talked to junior guard 
Zavier Simpson about how to not 
only keep passing lanes open, but 
also how to angle himself so that 
he’s in a good position to catch and 
shoot from an optimal location. 
And he’s also become tuned in to 
where his defenders are and how 
they might close out in different 
looks. That allows him to strike a 
balance between getting open and 
being as close to the arc as possible.
As for his depressed 3-point 
numbers, Poole’s just going to keep 
shooting. If there’s one thing he has 
in spades, it’s confidence, and he 
won’t let anything — whether it’s a 
few bad games or talk of slumps — 
faze him.
“Most of us shoot thousands of 
shots a day in practice and you’re 
working on shooting your shots 
and then you come to practice,” 
Poole said. “I mean, you shoot all 
the time. There’s gonna be days it 
ain’t going in and days it is. … You 
can’t change anything due to one 
game or two games.”

Storako starts season with a bang

After last weekend, one thing 
was cleared up for the No. 19 
Michigan softball team: who will 
back up sophomore left-hander 
Meghan Beaubien in the pitching 
rotation.
Alex Storako answered that 
question when the freshman 
right-hander made her collegiate 
debut in the first game of the 
season 
on 
Friday. 
Storako’s 
entrance at the top of the fifth 
inning, when the Wolverines 
were trailing North Carolina State 
by two, was a testament to the 
confidence she has earned from 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins. 
She didn’t disappoint, pitching 
the final three innings without 
allowing a single hit, which 
allowed Michigan to squeeze out 
a narrow 4-3 win.
“We were certainly excited to 
see what (Storako) was going to do 
for us,” Hutchins said. “She’s done 
nothing but get better for us.”
And from the looks of this 
weekend, Storako may be able 
to do a lot for the Wolverines. 
She gave up just nine hits over 
four games, seven of which were 
translated into runs. But things 

weren’t entirely smooth sailing for 
the freshman pitcher.
Just a few hours after her first 
collegiate pitch, the Wolverines 
started Storako in the circle in 
a game against No. 7 Arizona. 
Showing her first signs of faltering 
in the bottom of the third inning, 
Storako walked two Wildcats. 
This prompted Hutchins to visit 
Storako at the mound and provide 
some straightforward advice: Be 
confident out there.
“We want all pitchers to have 
command 
of 
their 
pitches,” 
Hutchins said. “In (Storako’s) 
case, she did a really nice job. She 
had a walk throw against Arizona 
and, more than anything, she 
needs to be very one pitch focused 
and really intense. Every pitch 
counts in this game. You can’t take 
a pitch off.
“I think (Sunday) she was 
probably a little tired. Everyone’s 
a little tired. Five games is a lot 
of games. It’s a long weekend, 
especially for a young pitcher.”
While Storako was later taken 
out of that game, she went on to 
play in games on both Saturday 
and Sunday.
Over the course of the weekend, 
Storako pitched a total of 15 
innings, just shy of Beaubien’s 18 

and far surpassing sophomore 
right-hander 
Sarah 
Schaefer’s 
single inning. Last week, Hutchins 
said she was looking for a pitcher 
to step up and allow Beaubien 
some rest. As a freshman last year, 
Beaubien pitched 217 of 371 total 
innings, a statistic that possibly 
accounted for the rise in her ERA 
towards the end of the season.
As Storako began to step into 
that role, Beaubien began to guide 
the younger pitcher.
“(Beaubien) is a great mentor,” 
Storako said. “I’m so excited to 
have her. She has such great poise 
and is someone that anyone would 
love to look up to. She’s really 
pointed me in the right direction 
at times and I love having her on 
the pitching staff with me.”
If the first weekend was any 
indication, it looks as though 
Storako will play a pivotal role in 
the pitching rotation alongside 
her mentor.
“I just want to improve on 
getting ahead of the count and 
attacking batters from the get-go,” 
Storako said. “Just staying loose 
throughout the whole game. I 
hope I can contribute to the team’s 
success because we just want to 
win and I will do whatever it takes 
to do that.”
