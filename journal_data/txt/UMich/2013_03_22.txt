Former UMHS
resident sentenced
at federal court in
child porn case
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
ManagingNews Editor
DETROIT - Stephen Jenson,
a former medical resident at the
University of Michigan Health
System, was sentenced Thurs-
day to 36 months in federal pris-
on for the possession of child
pornography.
The sentencing is the mini-
mum mandatory sentence for
possessing child pornography.
Jenson's attorney, Raymond
Cassar, argued that the nature
of his client's crime did not
require additional penalty.
Jenson was arrested by Uni-
versity Police in December 2011
after it was discovered that he
had viewed child pornography
in a University Hospital lounge.
A fellow resident found his flash
drive with obscene images on it
and later reported the discovery
to the attending physician.
An attorney in the UMHS ini-
tially told the resident that her
concerns about the flash drive
were' unfounded,' and neglected
to report the incident to Univer-
sity Police. It wasn't until six
months later that the incident

was re-reported by the attend-
ing physician and University
Police were notified. University
President Mary Sue Coleman
called the delay a "serious fail-
ure on the part of the institu-
tion." Communication problems
between University Police and
Hospital Security discovered
during an internal review of the
case prompted a reorganization
of campus security agencies,
which included the creation of
the Division of Public Safety and
Security, which puts all agen-
cies under an umbrella division
headed by UMPD chief Joe Pier-
sante, DPSS's interim executive
director.
Initial state charges were
dropped after the U.S. Secret
Service arrested Jenson on the
federal charges. Jenson was
found to be in possession of 97
images and four videos, some of
which he had viewed using hos-
pital computers.
Matthew Roth, the assistant
U.S. attorney prosecuting the
case, argued in a previous memo
that Jenson should be sentenced
to 48 months in prison because
the crime was committed on
a computer and the number of
images he possessed, among
other factors.
U.S. District Judge Avern
Cohn said though Jenson's
crime did meet such factors for
increasing the sentence, the

Anonymous gift
revealed to be from
Frankel family at
regents meeting
By JENNIFER CALFAS
and SAM GRINGLAS
DailyStaffReporters
The University Cardiovas-
cular Center will be named in
honor of the late Samuel and
Jean Frankel, whose family
donated a combined $50 mil-
lion to the center.
Coleman announced at the
University's Board of Regents

meeting Thursday that the
family added an additional $25
million to their previous anon-
ymous donation of $25 mil-
lion in 2007 when the center
opened. The Regents approved
the naming of the Cardiovas-
cular Center to recognize the
contributions.
The meeting marked the
first time the name of the
anonymous donation was iden-
tified. Coleman added that the
donation made the center "a
model in its approach to health
care."
The donation in 2007 sup-
ported a health-care model
focused on cooperation among
health-care providers and on

putting patients and families
first - a multi-disciplined
approach that has never been
attempted before.
Because of the success
of the first donation, the
Frankel family contributed
another donation to the cen-
ter to "build on successes
of the last six years," Ora
Pescovitz, the executive vice
president for medical affairs,
said. In an interview after
the event, Pescovitz said the
family's contributions have
made the University's Car-
diovascular Center an exam-
ple for others to follow and
has improved the U.S. World
& Report's rankings of the

center, where it ranks 12th in
the nation.
The center focuses on com-
bating cardiovascular disease
- the number-one killer of
Americans today - by pre-
venting, treating and studying
heart disease, blood vessel dis-
orders and stroke.
Pescovitz added the dona-
tions are a "transformational
gift" that alters how an insti-
tution functions, unlike small-
er gifts that may not have as
much of a dramatic impact.
In addition to contribut-
ing to the Center, Samuel and
Jean Frankel provided funding
in 2005 to create the Frankel

ADMINISTRATION
New dean of
Dentistry, vice
provosts OKed

Regents approve
Laurie McCauley
for Dentistry's
top spot
By JENNIFER CALFAS
and SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporters
The University's Board of
Regents approved several nomi-
nations for faculty and adminis-
trative positions at its meeting
Thursday.
Laurie McCauley was
approved as the new dean of the
University's School of Dentistry.
McCauley is a renowned expert
in the field of skeletal biology
and has a long history at the
University. She will begin her
five-year appointment on Sept.
1, succeeding current dean Peter
Polverini, who will step down
after serving two terms as dean.
McCauley earned her four
degrees from The Ohio State
University and began as an assis-
tant professor at the University
in 1992. She has been widely
published in a number of jour-
nals and written voluminously
on the effects of hormones on
bone growth and regeneration
and cellular function. She is cur-
rently on sabbatical and serv-
ing as a visiting professor at the
Harvard Medical School.

McCauley praised her prede-
cessors for the strong position
the school is in. The Dentistry
School is consistently ranked
among the top 10 dental pro-
grams in the country.
"I'm hoping to continue to
respect the clinicians as the
leaders and the best," McCau-
ley said. "I also want to provide
exceptional multidisciplinary
clinical care in our clinics and
sustaining the excellence we
have in our research mission.
McCauley reaffirmed her
commitment to teaching but
added that she would work to
sustain and increase the role
that research plays at the school.
"There's definitely pressure
with the government support
of research, but on the flipside,
we're really well positioned
with strength and outstanding
faculty," McCauleysaid. "I think
we can weather that storm.
We'll continue to be competitive
for our research."
She has also served on a
National Institutes of Health
advisory committee and is a
member of a number of profes-
sional associations, a statement
from the University said. She
has given over 150 presenta-
tions around the world on her
research and evidence-based
practice.
In a statement, Univer-
sity Provost Phil Hanlon said

Psi Upsilon
suspended from

By CHELSEA HOEDL
Daily StaffReporter
The University's chapter of
the Psi Upsilon fraternity was
suspended from activity March
15 and is currently under further
investigation for dangerous con-
duct with its pledges. The frater-
nity has also been expelled from
the University's Interfraternity
Council - the governing institu-
tion for fraternities on campus.
Several members of the Greek
community have received emails
from leaders suggesting that the
punishment is for an incident
that occurred the night of March
14. Messages allege that a pledge
was taken to the hospital after
registering a lethally high blood
alcohol content.
Tom Fox, executive director
of Psi Upsilon International Fra-
ternity, the fraternity's national
organization, said he was con-
tacted by William Atkins, assis-
tant director of Greek Life at the
University, regarding the inci-
dent.
"A young man was transport-

a location outside of the chapter
house on the evening of March

Students for Choice
put on 'Vagina
Monologues'
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily StaffReporter
"Myvagina is angry...No? It's
lonely," the actress exclaimed
under the bright lights of the
Rackham Auditorium stage.
"No! It's ... hungry!" She then
reached for a CVS bag under
her chair and poured a presum-
ably new bottle of Hershey's
syrup all over the girl sitting in
front of her, impersonating her
genitalia.
This was just one scene of

many in the vivacious perfor-
mance of "The Vagina Mono-
logues," a play that is made up
of skitsbased on over 200 inter-
views with real women and
their experiences with their
lady parts. "The Vagina Mono-
logues" were presented Thurs-
day by Students for Choice. The
organization said the show was
meant as a movement not just
to get students over the taboo
speaking about their body
parts, but to open a dialogue
about more serious issues fac-
ing women all over the world,
such as battery, rape and female
genital mutilation.
In between speeches about
discovering their feminin-
ity and embracing their sexu-

ality, the all-female student
cast raised awareness about
the 200,000 women who will
be raped and the one billion
women who will experience
violence worldwide in a year,
organizers said. Most proceeds
from the event went to Safe
House, a support center in Ann
Arbor for people impacted by
domestic violence and sexual
assault.
LSA freshman Connie Gao,
a Students for Choice member,
said while most of the audience
was open-minded and recep-
tive, she did receive some back-
lash while passing out fliers
outside the event.

Lecturers to
receive gradual
wage increases
By JENNIFER CALFAS
DailyStaffReporter
The Lecturers' Employee
Organization ratified their
labor contract with the Univer-
sity Thursday after creating a
tentative contract earlier this
month.
LEO - a union representing
1,500 lecturers across the Uni-
versity's Ann Arbor, Flint and
Dearborn campuses - voted
93.5 percent in favor of the con-
tract, which includes increased
wages over the next five years
and bolstered job security.
While lecturers from the
Flint and Dearborn campuses
will receive the same wages as
faculty on the tenure track, lec-
turers on the Ann Arbor cam-
pus will face a more gradual
increase in wages, starting at a
zero-percent increase the first
year of the contract and ending
at a 2.75-percent increase in the
fifth year.
Earlier this month, Univer-
sity spokesman Rick Fitzger-
ald said the University and
LEO reached a fair contract for
employees and the University
as a whole.
Bonnie Halloran, LEO presi-
dent, said that the agreement
for the Ann Arbor campus was
more difficult to reach than
for the Flint and Dearborn
campuses. Halloran said the
University worked conserva-
tively with its budget due to
the impacts of sequestration,
declining state appropriation
and a focus on tuition afford-
ability.
Although lecturers' salaries
will increase, they remain the
lowest-paid University fac-
ulty members, with annual
salaries of $33,300, $27,300
and $26,300 at the Ann Arbor,

Dearborn and Flint campuses,
respectively. The contract will
add an average of $1,100 to lec-
turers' starting salaries begin-
ning in the fourth year of the
agreement.
Despite the increases in sal-
ary, Halloran said LEO will
continue to advocate increases
in lecturer's salaries in the
future.
"No one with a master's
degree or a Ph.D. should be
starting with a salary as low as
that," Halloran said. "People
can't believe the salaries are
that low, so we're really goingto
work hard to improve that."
Earlier this month, LEO
spokeswoman Lila Naydan said
the current contract does not
allow University lecturers to
reach equitable pay structure
- equal pay for the teaching
portion of their work in com-
parison to tenured faculty and
faculty on the tenure track.
She added that LEO hopes to
achieve this in the future.
Michigan's so-called right-
to-work law - which makes it
illegal to require financial sup-
port of a union as a condition of
employment - goes into effect
on March 25 after a lame-duck
session of the Michigan legis-
lature at the end of 2012. Since
the new contract was ratified
Thursday, LEO and the Uni-
versity can still work under the
contents of the agreement.
While Halloran said there
was "tension" between LEO
and the University during
negotiations, she said the fact
that lecturers from all three
campuses voted with at least 90
percent in favor of the contract
shows its success.
She added that while the vot-
ing process for ratification only
requires at least two campuses
to approve, all three campuses
voted in favor of the contract.
"We worked hard and we
feel that we wrote the best
contract we could for the mem-
bers," Halloran said.

Governor signs bill
six years after voters
banned civil unions
DENVER (AP) - Civil unions
for gay couples got the gover-
nor's signature in Colorado on
Thursday, punctuating a dra-
matic turnaround in a state
where voters banned same-sex
marriage in 2006 and restrict-
ed protections for gays two
decades ago.
Cheers erupted as Demo-
cratic Gov. John Hickenlooper
signed the bill during a cer-
emony at the History Colo-
rado Center near the state
Capitol. Hundreds looked on,
with many chanting "Equal!
Equal!"
Some wiped away tears and
others hugged during the sign-
ing ceremony.
"There is no excuse that peo-
ple shouldn't have all the same
rights," Hickenlooper told the
crowd, which included doz-
ens of gay couples and others
watching from floors above.
The law takes effect May 1.
"It means I can change my
name finally," said 21-year-old
Amber Fuentes of Lakewood,
who plans to have a civil union
with Yolanda Martinez, 34.
"It's not marriage, but it still
gives us a lot of the rights,"
Martinez said.
Colorado will join eight
states that have civil unions or
similar laws. Nine states and
the District of Columbia allow
gay marriage.
The signing in Colorado
comes less than a year after the
proposal was blocked in the
House by Republicans.
"It's really meaningful. To
have the recognition of your
love and relationship just like
any other relationship by the
state is an important both legal
and symbolic thing," said Dem-
ocratic House Speaker Mark
Ferrandino, a sponsor of the

bill and the first gay lawmaker
to hold the title of speaker in
Colorado.
Supporters of civil unions say
the passage in Colorado also is
telling because in 1992, voters
approved a ban on municipal
antidiscrimination laws to pro-
tect gays. Four years later, the
U.S. Supreme Court said the
law, known as Amendment 2,
was unconstitutional - but not
before some branded Colorado a
"hate state."
Ferrandino said the shift
"shows how much through
hard work and through a very
thoughtful approach you can
change public opinion."
Civil unions grant gay cou-
ples rights similar to marriage,
including enhanced inheritance
and parental rights. People in
civil unions also would have the
ability to make medical deci-
sions for their partners.
Most Republicans opposed
the bill, saying they would've
liked to see religious exemp-
tions to provide legal protec-
tions for those opposed to civil
unions. Churches are shielded
under the new law, but Demo-
crats rejected protections for
businesses and adoption agen-
cies, arguing the Republican
suggestions were too broad and
could provide legal cover to dis-
criminate.
In May, Democrats said they
had enough votes to pass the bill.
But Republicans who controlled
the House by one vote prevented
debate on the measure.
Democrats took control of
the House in November and
retained the Senate.
Some Republicans insist the
bill is too similar to marriage,
and therefore violates the will
of voters in 2006. Because of
that constitutional amendment,
civil unions are the only option
for gay couples in Colorado for
now. That could change with a
U.S. Supreme Court ruling on
gay marriage bans in the com-
ing months.

Lawmakers pass
failing schools
oversight bill
The Republican-led House
approved legislation Thursday
that would give the state the go-
ahead to take control at some of
Michigan's lowest-performing
public schools, sparking a fiery
debate in the Legislature over
the course of action needed to
help persistently failing students
succeed in the classroom.
The bill passed 57-53 on a
mostly party-lines vote. It would
allow the Education Achieve-
ment Authority, currently in
place in 15 Detroit schools,
to take the reins at Michigan
schools in the bottom 5 percent
of achievement, based on student
test scores, for three straight
years.
Majority Republicans say the
program, which Republican Gov.
Rick Snyder has called one of his
top legislative priorities, is an
urgently needed way to give stu-
dents in failing schools a chance.

Cyrpus mulls, new

Cypriot politicians moved
Thursday to restructure the coun-

in place by Monday to avoid finan-

bank employees protested.
Cyprus has been told it must
raise 5.8 billion euros ($7.5 bil-
lion) if it is to receive iO billion
euros ($12.9 billion) from its fel-
low eurozone countries and the
International Monetary Fund. If it
does not find a wayby Monday, the
European Central Bank said it will
cut off emergency support to the
banks, lettingthem collapse.
That would throw the country
into financial chaos and, ultimate-
ly, cause it to leave the eurozone,

for the region.

That got him a standing ova-

Notebook: Regents give

CSG debate looks

approval for renovations at diverse issues

$55 million
Taubman library
renovation the
largest single item
By JENNIFER CALFAS,
SAM GRINGLAS AND
PETER SHAHIN
Daily StaffReporters and
Daily News Editor
At Thursday's meeting of
the Board of Regents, the Uni-
versity's top governing body
approved a number of renova-
tion and construction projects
and a number of honorary
degrees to be granted during
May's commencement ceremo-
nies and heard from University
President Mary Sue Coleman
about the selection of Dick
Costolo, CEO of Twitter, as the
speaker for the event.
Coleman began her remarks
by recognizing last month's
$50-million donation to LSA.
The donation, made by Univer-
sity alum Helen Zell, the wife
of real estate mogul Samuel
Zell, was used to establish 22
permanent scholarships for a
master's program in creative
writing. The contribution
marks the biggest donation in
the college's history and the
third largest to the University.
"Just as Helen Zell is a
thoughtful and engaged gradu-
ate of the University, so, too, is
Dick Costolo, the CEO of Twit-
ter - the speaker at this year's
commencement program,"
Coleman said. "This is a pow-
erful group of individuals that
are leaders inbusiness, arts and
humanities and philanthropy."
The big-ticket item on
the regents' agenda was the
approval of architectural
designs for a renovation to
the Taubman Health Sciences
Library. The Taubman Health
Sciences Library is one of the
largest medical libraries in the
United States and also holds
some of the oldest medical
records in the world - some
dating as far back as 1470. The
$55-million project was origi-
nally approved at the April
2012 meeting.
During the renovation, the
library will transfer parts of
its collection to an offsite loca-
tion to open up floor space for
academic use. The 137,000
square-foot renovation budgets
a smaller area for the actual
library collection and more
space for instructional needs.
New additions will include a
clinical skills and simulation
suite, more computing and
study areas, and space desig-
nated for faculty and student
service.
The Medical School will
bear the cost of the project,
scheduled to be completed in
fall 2015. There will be 72 on-
site workers employed during
the renovation process.
Twitter CEO Dick Costolo
and six others granted
honorary degrees
The regents approved six
honorary degree recipients in
addition to this year's spring
commencement speaker, Twit-
ter CEO and 1985 alum Dick

Costolo.
In an interview with the
Daily on Sunday, Costolo said
he was surprised by the Uni-
versity's choice of speaker.
"It's really the single great-
est honor I could ever imag-
ine receiving," Costolo said.
"When I grew up as a kid out-
side of Detroit in Troy, I always
wanted to go to Michigan.
It was the only university I
applied to, and I always knew I
wanted to go there."
The regents also approved
six other honorary degree
recipients, which will be pre-
sented in April.
University alum and philan-
thropist William Brehm will
receive a Doctor of Laws. The
co-founder and chair of SRA
International, a consulting
firm focused on national secu-
rity, Brehm previously worked
at the Department of Defense
during the 1960s and 1970s.
He has made significant dona-
tions to the University, nota-

bly an $8-million contribution
to renovate the Earl V. Moore
building at the School of Music,
Theatre & Dance.
The University will honor
ballerina and educator Suzanne
Farrell this spring with a Doc-
tor of Fine Arts. Farrell cur-
rently produces the dance
company she founded that's
produced at the Kennedy Cen-
ter in Washington, D.C.
Recipient Rosabeth Kanter,
former editor of the Harvard
Business Review and a business
professor at Harvard Business
School, has published multiple
books on business leadership
and sustainability. She will
receive a Doctor of Letters.
From University of Michi-
gan-Flint, former Democratic
Congressman Dale Kildee (D)
will receive a Doctor of Laws.
Kildee served in office for 36
years before his retirement last
year.
David McCullough, Pulitzer
Prize and Presidential Medal
of Freedom honoree, will
receive a Doctor of Humane
Letters.
He is a historian and the
author of several bestselling
biographies on U.S. presidents
and other historical topics.
Jeffrey Sachs, economist and
director of the Earth Institute
at Columbia University, will
receive a Doctor of Science at
the University of Michigan-
Dearborn. As a special adviser
to the United Nations Secretary
General, his work has focused
on international development
and poverty eradication.
Coleman lauded this year's
honorees for contributions that
align with future aspirations of
this year's graduates.
"Their accomplishments
speak well to the potential
and promise of our graduating
class," Coleman said.
Regents approve South
Quad and Moore Building
renovation
While South Quad sche-
matic renovation designs
were approved last month, the
regents approved construction
bids and contracts for the proj-
ect.
With a price tag of $60 mil-
lion, the project calls for reno-
vation of South Quad's ground
and first floors as well as bath-
rooms throughout the building,
encompassing nearly 106,700
square feet. The design calls
for an updated and enlarged
dining facility akin to the Hill
Dining Center, which serves as
a dining hub for the Hill neigh-
borhood.
Additionally, reconfigured
study spaces, music practice
rooms, and study lounges will
foster new spaces for student
interaction.
Along with prominent
changes to the space, infra-
structure improvements will
include new plumbing, fire
detection and suppression sys-
tems, wireless Internet and
accessibility improvements.
Generating 131 on-site con-
struction jobs, the project is
scheduled for completion in the
summer of 2014.
Regents also authorized
reconstruction of the Earl V.
Moore Building roof for an

estimated cost of $1.8 million
funded by investment pro-
ceeds.
The current roof has exceed-
ed its projected life span and
is now showing signs of wear,
Slottow said in a communica-
tion to the regents. The project,
which includes improvements
to roof walkway surfaces and
roofing systems, will be com-
pleted by the fall of 2013.
Regents approve softball
facility schematic designs
During the meeting, regents
also approved the schematic
design for the Softball Center
New Facility project. The agen-
da item included a revised bud-
get and a proposal to increase
allocated funds from $4 million
to $5.2 million with the assis-
tance of Athletic Department
resources and gifts.
In a communication with the
regents, Athletic Director Dave
Brandon and Timothy Slottow,

the University's executive vice
president and chief financial
officer, said the original project
budget presented in October
underestimated the true cost of
the facility.
Integrated Architecture will
complete the 10,200 square-
foot project, which will include
new player and coaching staff
locker rooms, new offices,
hydrotherapy pools, fitness
spaces and meeting spaces.
Slated for completion in
winter 2014, the project will
employ 19 on-site construction
workers.
Winter Classic may be
back on for January 1, 2014
Coleman also used the meet-
ing to announce that, despite
a cancellation this year, the
Big House tentatively plans
to host the NHL Winter Clas-
sic on Jan. 1, 2014. The Winter
Classic was supposed to take
place earlier this year, but was
canceled due to the National
Hockey League's lockout and
labor dispute.
While the regents affirmed
their support for hosting the
classic, associate athletic direc-
tor Dave Ablauf said the NHL
has not officially confirmed
the event and won't until they
announce the resolution of
their labor contracts.
"They haven't announced
any date yet. The regents con-
firmed the support for when-
ever the NHL announces it,"
Ablauf said.
The NHL was forced to pay
the University $100,000 last
year despite the cancellation.
The NHL will compensate the
University up to $3 million for
the use of the Big House during
the event.

Candidates spar
over diversity,
entrepreneurship
By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
and STEPHEN YAROS
Daily StaffReporters
Eighty minutes was all it took
for the five presidential candi-
dates to express their views on
issues that the Central Student
Government would face in the
follow academic year.
While Business junior Scott
Christopher appeared as an inde-
pendent candidate, all others
represented a party or an orga-
nization. These included LSA
junior Chris Osborn, forUM's
candidate and current CSG
treasurer; LSA freshman Nick
Swider, momentUM's candidate,
a CSG intern and the sole fresh-
man to run for the presidency
in CSG history; Business junior
Michael Proppe, youMICH can-
didate and CSG speaker; and LSA
sophomore Chene Karega, DAAP
vice presidential candidate and
running mate for Rackham stu-
dent Ashley Garrick.
During the previous CSG
assembly meeting, a controver-
sial resolution to support the
University's divestment from fos-
sil fuels failed to pass. Represen-
tatives for the Divest and Invest
movement, which supported the
resolution, were present at the
debate and questioned the candi-
dates on their views.
While Proppe believed that
divestment would not solve any
sustainability issues on campus,
other candidates affirmed its
importance and hoped to look
into renewing the resolution in
the next year.
Diversity was another prev-
alent theme throughout the
debate, and the issue reached a
head when a student in the audi-
ence addressed the issue. When
asked if they support affirma-
tive action, the answer from each,
candidate was a "yes."
All five candidates said minor-
ity student representation was
a problem at the University
and believed that affirmative
action was part of the solution.
Proppe admitted to having con-
flicted views on the issue not
long before. Daniel Morales, a
youMICH candidate and leader
of Coalition for Tuition Equal-

ity, helped convince Proppe to
change his views.
"I admit in the past I did not
support affirmative action in col-
lege admissions," Proppe said.
"But I think it is extremely impor-
tantto have that diversity of expe-
rience, to learn from people with
different backgrounds than you."
The other candidates echoed
Proppe's sentiments, agreeing
that the implementation of such
policies would promote a more
diverse studentbody.
Reflecting DAAP's role in the
University as an advocate for
minority issues, Karega spoke
out on the issue.
"We are all Americans and we
believe that everyone deserves to
go to school, everyone needs edu-
cation," Karega said. "We want
to double minority enrollment at
this University."
Under the leadership of CSG
President Manish Parikh and
Vice President Omar Hashwi,
CSG involvement with entrepre-
neurship has grown over the past
year. All candidates, except for
that runningunder DAAP, voiced
support for entrepreneurship.
youMICH's platform cur-
rently involves creating a resi-
dential learning community that
would provide students with a
5-year curriculum during which
they would earn a bachelor's and
master's degree in business while
creating small businesses.
Onthe other hand, Osbornsaid
forUM would work on developing
curricula already in the works,
such as the Flipped Semester,
rather than creating anything
entirely new. The Flipped Semes-
ter is a proposed nine-credit
entrepreneurship learning expe-
rience that would replace a tradi-
tional semester at the University.
Christopher's involvement
with Parikh's endeavors as the
chair of the ECommission and
president of MPowered has
placed him in the middle of
many entrepreneurial initiatives
this year. He said that this focus
would continue in the following
year under his presidency.
While the ECommission is the
most funded commission in CSG,
Karega thought that there were
more vital issuescthatthe CSG could
focus their energies on than sup-
porting business-minded students.
"Ijustwantto remind everyone
that there is the Ross School of
Business, so if anyone wants, they
can go there."

Give students asay
Selecting commencement speakers should be more inclusive
Trending news on campus is the announcement of the 2013
commencement speaker, Twitter CEO Dick Costolo. A gradu-
ate of the University with a degree in computer science, Cos-
tolo was invited to speak on May 4 by University President Mary Sue
Coleman. The selection of a new commencement speaker during Cen-
tral Student Government election season brings an important issue to
light: Students don't have an adequate say in deciding who the com-
mencement speaker will be. Regardless of the method it chooses, the
University should give students a more active role in choosing their

n Monday, a breath of fresh
air was blown into the
Republican Party with the
release of a new
mandate call-
ing for dramatic
reforms. The
Growth and
Opportunity
Project provided
a harsh, but
realistic, critique TIMOTHY
ofmanyissues BURROUGHS
that led to Mitt
Romney's failed
presidential cam-
paign. It focused on effective com-
munication of the party's platform
while avoiding any serious discus-
sion of changes in policy. When I
spoke with Ari Fleischer, co-author
of the report and press secretary
under former President George W.
Bush, said, "If you are goingto be a
growing, vibrant party, you need to
be able to learnfrom your mistakes."
The Democrats met the 2008
election with an open mind and pio-
neered social media campaigning. In
contrast, Republicans have consis-
tently been playing catch-up - using
Reagan-era rhetoric and appealing
to a consistently shrinking audience.
The report points out that Republi-
cans have lost five of the last six pres-
idential popular elections.
"The numbers speak for them-
selves," said Fleischer. "Republi-
cans need to be more inviting and
inclusive about what it means to be
a conservative."
The report stresses the impor-
tance of establishing a much stron-
ger youth base for future success.
Fleischer explained, "You get the
sense that young people think the
Republican Party is too old, too white
and too wealthy and that it is not a
home for them. Republicans need to
listen and welcome young people into
the party."
Getting this group engaged clearly
needs to be the party's top priority.

By motivating students, Republicans
create the next generation of party
members while bringing energy and
innovation to current campaigns.
Tea Party leaders have already
condemned the report. Jenny Beth
Martin, a co-founder of the Tea
Party Patriots, released a statement
saying we "don't need an 'autopsy'
report from RNC to know they
failed to promote our principles and
lost because of it." Other far-right
conservatives, such as radio host
Rush Limbaugh, have criticized the
report for making the party appear
weak and calling for unnecessary
reforms of Republican protocols.
This arrogance and resistance to
change has led to the major decline
in the Republican Party's influence
at the federal level. Its stubbornness
has caused voters to see Republicans
as outdated and unable to evolve.
Fleischer explained, "America is
changing. It's less white than it used
to be and more diverse than it used to
be. Republicans have to have policies
that are conservative and appeal to a
growingslice of the electorate."
Following the November cam-
paign, many criticized Republican
candidates' single-minded policy
approach. However, Fleischer said,
"We say here (within the commit-
tee) that our standards should not
be ideological purity, but invite
conservatism that recognizes if
someone disagrees with us on 20
percent of the issues, that doesn't
make them a 100-percent enemy, it
makes them an 80-percent friend."
A positive step came recently
when Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio)
announced that he supported gay
marriage after reevaluating his
views. The true strength of party
was apparent as many claimed,
that while they might not agree
with Portman, they respected him
and testified that he's still a good
Republican. Fleischer commented
that this is an example of how the
party really is a "big tent," where

many can feel welcome.
While the report outlines a stra-
tegic path to grow and strengthen
the GOP, the party is still far from
the White House. Following a presi-
dential term filled with unfulfilled
promises and continued economic
woes, noconservative candidate was
able to separate himself through the
primary process and defeat Barack
Obama. Additionally, many Republi-
cans, ranging from Tea Party mem-
bers to moderates, lost Senate and
House races that appeared to be
locks. Fleischer and the committee's
plan only works as well as its imple-
mentation, which will take signifi-
cant effort and funds. However, the
message and ideas are clearly there
to rejuvenate the party - its success
just depends on the party's willing-
ness to join the 21st century.
Their success just
depends on their
willingness to join
the 21st century.
With party leaders such as House
Majority Leader Eric Cantor and
former House speaker Newt Gin-
grich applauding the report as a
great first step, the future is bright
for the Republican Party. Clearly,
there are significantissues that need
addressing, but the platform and
principles appear as strong as ever.
Inclusivity and innovation could be
just the kick-starts the party needs.
If the party can become one of a
broader base by preaching accep-
tance, the Republicans will gain the
added boost they need to retake the
White House in 2016.

commencement speaker.
Commencementspeakers are chosen by the
Honorary Degree Committee. The commit-
tee is led by Coleman, and only two students
serve on the committee. There's an online
selection form that students can fill out and
send into the committee, but ultimately, the
committee makes the final decision. Also, the
speaker must be eligible to receive an honor-
ary degree from the University. Recent com-
mencement speakers include Sanjay Gupta,
Governor Rick Snyder and President Barack
Obama. There are, however, several faults
with this process. The option to submit a
request for a speaker isn't publicized well
enough, so students don't even know they can
influence the decision. The two students who
do get on the committee can't possibly speak
for the entire student body. Plus, one student
submitting a form has much less influence
than deans or higher-level officials. The com-
mittee must allow students to participate ina
broader and more unified way.
The lack of a student voice can lead to
conflict over the speaker. In 2011, when Sny-
der was selected to give the commencement
address, students protested the choice by
signing a petition and protesting a Board of
Regents' meeting. Students were upset that
he had recently cut 15 percent of the state's
higher-education funding, yet they barely had

a voice to choose someone else whom they
preferred. The Honorary Degree Commit-
tee must concede its power over choosing the
speakers, and students should be able to have a
strong influence on the process.
Finally, CSG candidates must have a stance
on this issue. Past CSG Presidents have prom-
ised to secure more student involvement in the
selection process, but they've failed to keep
those promises. CSG candidates can look to
other schools for ideas. For example, Syracuse
University has an online form open a year in
advance. An all-student committee organizes
every student submission, trimming it down
to a short list they send to the chancellor, who
makes the final decision based on availabil-
ity and cost, but overall, students are more
involved in the process.
The selection of commencement speakers
must be expanded to include the student voice.
The speech, after all, is meant for the students,
and the speaker is there to deliver an inspiring
message to the graduating class. The Univer-
sity needs to publicize the process of selecting
a speaker, and it could even create a shortlist
of eligible speakers for the students to vote
on. By making students valuable participants
in this process, the University can ensure that
the speaker, in some sense, is the voice of the
student body.

LAURA HOBBSI D
Sustainable divestment

On Wednesday, representatives of the LSA
Student Government voted overwhelmingly
in favor of a resolution supporting divestment
from fossil-fuel-industry financial assets.
Unfortunately, just one day earlier, the Cen-
tral Student Government failed to pass the
same resolution.
This failure highlights a serious contra-
diction here at our University. Michigan is a
leader in climate change research and sus-
tainability. Yet, the University directly invests
in the industry most responsible for the rapid
rate at which our climate is changing. Stu-
dents can't stand for this.
"If it's wrong to wreck the climate, it's
wrong to profit from that wreckage," as Bill
McKibben, an environmentalist and journal-
ist, has said. Divestment from fossil fuels is
a concrete step toward moving beyond fossil
fuels both here and on Capitol Hill. It sends a
clear message that we will not be passive sup-
porters of the status quo any longer.
The University is at the forefront of climate
science research, with 667 faculty members
across 13 schools and colleges all focusing on
sustainability. Furthermore, the administra-
tion has increased its funding for sustainabil-
ity research by 200 percent since 2003.
Student organizations are also at the fore-
front of campaigning for change. Histori-
cally, CSG has played an important role in the
sustainability movement on campus. They
have supported a number of issues for public
transportation and water-bottle refill sta-
tions. However, these steps are not enough.
The students here at the University want to
see systemic changes in the way we produce
and consume energy and a resolution in favor

of divestment.
A tentative analysis of university invest-
ments (pending further disclosure) shows at
least $900 million invested in the fossil fuel
industry. This nearly billion-dollar invest-
ment completely contradicts the University's
commitment to climate science. Let's use our
University's endowment, and the endow-
ments of other universities, to support solu-
tions to the crisis, and not add to the problem.
As a first step, the University must disclose all
current investments in the fossil fuel industry,
then move to divest. It's imperative that both
the University administration and CSG take a
stand for this. Furthermore, they should sup-
port more investment in sustainable sciences,
technologies and economic ventures.
As students and faculty members of this
great university, we cannot stand idly by and
indirectly support fossil fuel investments.
Our campaign asks that you get informed
on the issue, start a dialogue and show your
representatives how you feel about the issue.
Let's work to align our University's invest-
ments with its core values.
This is the time to speak up. These student
leaders represent us. Show your support for
divestment by visiting our website (dives-
tUM.org), signing the petition, volunteer-
ing with the campaign, signing your student
organization as a coalition partner and/or
voting next week for CSG candidates who
strongly support sustainability and want to
move forward with divestment, such many
candidates running on the forUM platform.
Take a stand, Michigan.
Laura Hobbs is an LSA freshman.

f I were a Republican, I would
be very concerned for the
future of my party. I would
question how
my party has
forgotten the
core elements b
that once made
it so appealing.
Presently, being
conservative and
being Republi-
can can mean PATRICK
two entirely dif- MAILLET
ferent things.
What hap-
pened to the party that stood firmly
upon the one core concept that the
government should stay out of peo-
ple's lives as much as possible?
This core concept has been com-
pletely disregarded by the GOP in
their vehement opposition to gay
marriage. Beyond party platform,
opposition to gay marriage has
become a reckless political agenda.
A 2012 Gallup Poll shows that 53
percent of Americans support the
legalization of same-sex marriage.
More alarming to the GOP though,
is that 73 percent of members of the
18- to 29-year-old demographic sup-
port same-sex marriage. Aside from
the complete hypocrisy of a "conser-
vative" believing that the govern-
ment can tell someone whom they
are allowed to love, the GOP's anti-
gay stance is one that will hurt them
in coming elections.
If I were a Republican, I would
question why a party founded
on staying out of people's lives is
obsessed with controlling the repro-
ductive rights of women. When will
the GOP realize that their war on
women is one that women will inev-
itably win? As we saw in this last
election cycle, it turns out women
actually get upset when prominent
Republicans mention "legitimate
rape," refer to women who defend
their right to take contraception as
"sluts," or promise that, if they were
elected president, they would only
nominate U.S. Supreme Court Jus-
tices who advocate on overturning
Roe v. Wade. Who knew? It's almost

like women actually took a stand to
the concept of a bunch of men tell-
ing them what's best for them and
their uteruses.
Maybe this has something to do
with the gender voting gap in the
presidential election rising from a
12-point difference between men
and women in the 2008 presidential
election to a staggering 18-point dif-
ference in 2012. As if that statistic
wasn't enough, swing states such
as Ohio, New Hampshire and Penn-
sylvania - all states that ensured
Obama's electoral victory - were
the states where the gender gap
was strongest. After all, when the
most well-known female members
of the GOP are Sarah Palin and Rep.
Michelle Bachman, can you really
blame women for running desper-
ately to the left?
The worst part about the GOP's
complete disregard for women in
the 2012 election is that they haven't
done anything to reverse this sui-
cidal trend. Along with countless
Republicans still opposing equal
pay for equal work - and when I say
"countless," I actually mean Repub-
lican senators voted unanimously
against the Paycheck Fairness Act in
2012 - many prominent Republicans
opposed the reauthorization of the
"Violence Against Women Act" last
month. Those Republicans included
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Sen.
Rand Paul (R-Ky.). These men are
widely considered the "rising stars"
of the GOP, and Rubio was even cho-
sen to give the Republican response
to this year's State of the Union. If
one of these men is on the presiden-
tial ticket in 2016, does the GOP real-
lythink womenwillsimplyforgetthe
egregious stances these men possess?
From suppressing voters to pro-
tecting tax cuts for the wealthy,
it's not surprising that the GOP has
gained the reputation of being the
party of rich, white men. Obviously,
this stereotype isn't entirely true,
but can you really blame the Ameri-
can people for giving Republicans
this typecast? After all, when men
like the Koch Brothers and Sheldon
Adelson - the three mega-donors of

the GOP - are treated like royalty
within the party, aren't the aver-
age Americans eventually going
to question where the GOP's alle-
giance lies?
Moderate
Republicans don't
stand a chance in
the GOP primary.
Unfortunately, the solution to
the GOP's grim and outdated future
doesn't seem very attainable. The
problem lies mostly in the ridicu-
lousness of the GOP's primary sys-
tem. As we saw in this past election,
any candidate who can even be con-
sidered for the Republican nomina-
tion has to throw him or herself so
far to the right that once the gener-
al election begins, most moderates
are turned off by the candidate's
radical views. Although candidates
certainly have to prove their liberal
credentials in the Democratic pri-
mary, it's not nearly as damaging as
the Republican counterpart. Due to
this extreme weeding-out process,
any socially moderate Republican
is kept far from ever gaining the
Republican nomination. Repub-
licans such as Jon Huntsman or
New York City Mayor Michael
Bloomberg - two men that would
probably bring in many moder-
ate voters - don't stand a chance
at surviving the grueling process
because Republican primary voters
will chastise any of their socially-
lenient stances.
The RepublicanPartyhasbecome
out of touch and outdated. It needs
to rethink what its core ideals are or
it will continue to lose presidential
elections. Unless it begins to ree-
ognize its faults, the GOP will con-
tinue to ostracize more and more
American voters.

own experiences. Together they
create a collaborative artistic
environment where anyone is
free to suggest the direction the
workshop takes or the prompts
they write on or the scenes they
perform.
"That's the point of PCAP, is
that everyone has this creativ-
ity," said LSA junior and English
310 and 319 student Talia Hor-
witz. "It's just that a space needs
to be created for that to come
out in. My creativity definitely
comes out through PCAP with
the boys in the workshop."
Alexander and Paul have put
on the exhibition for 18 years
now. The first exhibit had 72
paintings on display from 50 art-
ists. This year, the PCAP exhibi-
tion will host 428 works of art
from over 200 artists. All of the
pieces are up for sale, the prices
being determined by the artists
or with help from the curators.
Since the artwork, once it leaves
the prison, cannot go back inside
the prison to be with the artist,
PCAP makes sure that the art-
ist has named a family or friend
who they would like the art to go
to in the event that they cannot
sell the piece.
"We're very on top of mak-
ing sure this work has a home
that the artist wants it to go to
because it can't go back to stay
with them," Adelson said.
PCAP also encourages those
who attend the gallery during
its two-week display to write in
a guest book about their expe-
riences with the art and the
exhibit. The comments are then
sent back to the artists.
"We hear some of the guys
have said, 'I wait and wait until
that packet arrives because I
want to see the comments people
are leaving,' and they sleep on
it," Adelson said. "I know guys
who keep it under their pillow
and sleep on it at night because
that's the world to them reflect-
ing back on something that they
did. And for most of these men
and women, that kind of valida-
tion doesn't exist. It certainly
doesn't exist inside prison."
The exhibition, having out-
grown its original space at the
Rackham gallery, is quickly
requiring additional space
beyond the confines of the Dud-
erstadt. While PCAP originally
started with correctional facili-
ties within a 120-mile radius
of Ann Arbor, last year PCAP
received a grant to work on
expanding to correctional facili-
ties in the upper-part of the
Lower Peninsula and the Upper
Peninsula that usually don't
have access to PCAP; as always,
however, an artist from any
institution in Michigan may sub-
mit their artwork for the exhibit.
"For me, there's a palpable
energy when everything is
up," Adelson said. "One of my
closest friends who was in my
workshop when she was still in
prisons, who came home a few
years ago, she said 'I can hear
their voices. I know what it's
like to be every person on this
wall.' It's really special. I urge
everyone to have that moment.
To disconnect from the whole
law, prison, crime triangulation
to just come in and look at the
work."

It has to be pretty boring to

pus or battling in Valhalla for
all eternity.
Thankfully for A

Studio's entry
to the Mas-
sively Online Hi-Rez
Battle Arena
(MOBA) genre,
the recently out-of-closed beta
"SMITE," pulls gods from every
pantheon and puts their power
in players' hands.
"SMITE" stands out from its
peers by offering four different
game modes and an over-the-
shoulder perspective. The lack
of an overhead camera restricts
visibility, making Combat feel
more similar to "World of War-
craft" than "League of Leg-
ends" or "Dota 2." All attacks
are "skillshots," meaning they
must be manually aimed, adding
another layer of difficulty to the
frantic combat. Player accounts
level up as they play, unlocking
access to new game modes.
The standard three-lane,
tower-pushing extravaganza is
present in "SMITE" via the Con-
quest game mode, where two
teams of five gods fight for domi-
nance. Each base is protected by
three Phoenixes and a Minotaur,
powerful creatures who pun-
ish overconfident teams. Jungle
monsters provide buffs rang-
ing from reduced cooldowns on
abilities to team-wide multi-stat
upgrades. Organized teams can
play in unranked and ranked
modes, the latter offering bans
and favoring tactical god choices
and decision making to climb in
rank.
For those tired of game after
game of team-centric, base-
taking tedium, "SMITE" offers
three other modes - joust,
arena and domination. Joust is a
condensed version of Conquest,
where players face off one-on-

other's respective towers and

It's not only a

can trace back their roots. For
decades, the city was a melting
pot for European immigrants,
Southern sharecroppers, rich
and poor, black and white. But
long-standing segregation and
institutionalized racism within
the city led to one of the most
violent civil clashes in U.S. his-
tory.
Thick black clouds of smoke
billow from buildings; snipers sit
on rooftops; tanks of the Michi-
gan National Guard roll through
the city streets. These are the
images that come to mind when
talking about the 1967 Detroit
riot. However, the emotional
responses to these images vary
greatly from person to person. A
new play examines this riot vs.
rebellion point of view and also
the similarities that bind Detroi-
ters of all races.
"Spirit of Detroit," written
by native Detroiter and Univer-
sity alum Mercilee M. Jenkins,
examines the turbulent events of
1967, including the riot-rebellion
and the Algiers Motel Incident,
in which police murdered three

participate in
a cooperative-

opinions and suggestions are of
equal value.
School of Music junior Jake
Woollen is the founder and orga-
nizer of the group, with help
from Assistant Professor of Con-
ducting and Associate Director
of Orchestras Christopher Lees.
"The idea really germinated
this summer at the Aspen Music
Festival in Colorado," Woollen
said. "I was there as a cellist,
and several other Michigan peo-
ple were there too - Chris Lees
and several other string players
- and that's really where the
idealistic air of Colorado really
allowed these ideas to flourish."
Woollen further developed
his dream during the fall semes-
ter while he studied abroad in
Paris. He began planning and
organizing the group and was
heavily inspired by the art of
music-making as practiced in
Europe.

JENSON
From Page 1
guidelines are irrelevant to the
case. Cohn pointed out that com-
puters are universally used to
view child pornography and the
amount of images that Jenson
possessed was not large com-
pared to other cases.
Prosecutors have drawn
attention to the fact that Jen-
son was undergoing pediatric
training at UMHS, noting that
he would eventually be able to
treat children. However, Cas-
sar said he intended to be an
oncologist, not specializing in
pediatrics, and claimed that
his training was unfairly held
against him.
Cassar painted the picture of a
man who had a love for medicine
and a passion for cancer research
but would now likely not be able
to become a physician.
"He led an extraordinary life,"
Cassar told the court. "He spent
the last seven years (in medi-
cine). He's lost them. He's done."
Cassar asked the judge to
acknowledge that Jenson does
not present a risk to public safe-
ty, noting that not doing so would
prevent him from accessing pro-
grams like therapy in prison.
Cassar said the University
community "abandoned" Jenson
after his crime was discovered,
and therefore asked that Cohn
allow him to serve his sentence

in a prison near his hometown in
Utah.
Cohn confirmed that Jenson
is not a risk to public safety and
agreed to place him in a correc-
tional facility near his home-
town. The judge ordered that
Jenson surrender himself to the
court within 90 days of the sen-
tencing.
In a brief address to the court,
Jenson said he was aware of the
consequences of possessing child
pornography.
"I knew what I did was
wrong," Jenson said. "When
I was looking at the images, I
knew it was wrong."
Jenson told the court that he
would attempt to rehabilitate
himself, both in prison and in
therapy.
"I am trying to do what I need
to do to make myself a better
man," he said.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily after he was sen-
tenced, Jenson said he looks for-
ward to completing his sentence
so that he can work on a career in
medicine.
"My only is hope thatafterthis
chapter of my life with prison is
done, I will be able to be helping
people and practicing medicine,"
Jenson said.
Before attending medical
school, Jenson was a cancer
researcher. He said he would go
back to research if he is unable
to get a job practicing medicine
upon his release.

DONORS
From Page 1
Institute for Advanced Judaic
Studies - the largest ever gift to
LSA at the time.
"This is a family that really
cares passionately about phi-
lanthropy and giving back,"
Pescovitz said. "They pick areas
where they believe that they can
make a difference, both in the
quality of life and in the quality
of the community."
She added that their gifts
have transformed the Universi-
ty in the areas of health, culture
and education.
Speaking on behalf of his
family at the meeting, Stanley
Frankel, the son of Samuel and
Jean Frankel, said the center's
success should be attributed to
the medical team.
"We say but don't do much,"
Frankel said. "We're just the
facilitators. The doors are the
faculty and staff and leadership
in the CVC, and that's what's
important."
Several administrators -
including Jerry May, vice presi-
dent of development - thanked
the Frankel family at the meet-
ing for their contributions.
"The Frankel family have
added a great deal to the qual-
ity of education at the insti-
tution," May said. "We are
so honored and thankful for
(their) legacy."

NOMINATIONS
From Page 1A
McCauley's wide range of expe-
riences made her stand out as a
candidate for the school's high-
est position.
"Professor McCauley is a sea-
soned academic administrator
whose service to the School of
Dentistry, the University and
beyond is extensive," said Han-
lon. "She brings a unique blend
of clinical experience, research
achievement, pedagogical lead-
ership and administrative suc-
cess to the position."
Alfred Franzblau to succeed
Pollack as Vice Provost for
Academic and Budgetary
Affairs
Regents also approved Alfred
Franzblau, associate dean for
research at the School of Public
Health, as vice provost for aca-
demic and budgetary affairs.
Franzblau's term will begin in
May and conclude in June 2018.
The position is currently held by
Pollack, who will take over as
provost in May.
As vice provost, he will work
with the provost to maintain
policy in academic and budget-
ary issues and serve as a liaison
to deans and directors.
Franzblau worked as an
assistant professor inthe School
of Public Health when he joined

the University faculty in 1989.
He has also worked as an asso-
ciate research scientist in the
Center for Ergonomics in the
Department of Industrial and
Operations Engineering and as
a professor for Environmental
Health Sciences.
Franzblau was appointed as
associate dean for research in
the School of Public Health in
2011, where he has overseen
total research funding in 2011
to 2012 of more than $66 mil-
lion.
"Dr. Franzblau is an out-
standing mentor and an inspir-
ing teacher," Hanlon said. "I am
confident that he will provide
excellent leadership in academ-
ic and budgetary affairs."
James Holloway appointed
Vice Provost for
International Affairs
The regents also appointed
James Holloway as the nextvice
provost for international affairs.
Holloway is currently a profes-
sor of nuclear engineering and
radiological sciences and asso-
ciate dean of undergraduate
education.
In an interview with the
Daily, Holloway said he is excit-
ed about the opportunity to cre-
ate energy in how the University
engages on the global stage.
"I'm reallylookingforward to
this opportunity. It's a tremen-
dous honor to be asked to serve

in this capacity and I'm greatly
looking forward to growing
global scholarly impact the Uni-
versity of Michigan can have,"
Holloway said.
In his new role, Holloway
will oversee experiential learn-
ing programs across the Uni-
versity such as study abroad
opportunities or Semester in
Detroit. While units and col-
leges across campus have their
own departments that handle
these programs, Holloway's
office helps coordinate oppor-
tunities throughout the Univer-
sity.
Holloway hopes to bring
together faculty and students
across departments to create
the richest and broadest set of
programs.
Still, Holloway said deal-
ing with costs and creating a
culture that emphasizes the
value of these learning experi-
ences are two difficult tasks
for the job. He hopes study-
abroad opportunities and simi-
lar programs will be seen as an
expectation of an undergradu-
ate experience. Scale is also an
issue, as it will take a great deal
of coordination to potentially
expand the program to a level
that encompasses the majority
of University students.
Holloway hopes his office
will play the coordinating role
in removing these barriers and
extending programs to a wide
array of campus.


WOMEN

tain comments or glare at us, but
you just have to go with it," Gao
said. "Even when people respond
negatively and it's easy to dismiss
them, you have to try and educate
them about why choice is impor-
tant."
Gao added that it's been five
years since "The Vagina Mono-
logues" has come to campus and
she hopes its return will make
people more comfortable discuss-
ing these topics.
"It's okay to be uncomfortable
as long as you start talking," she
said. "I don't know how you can
claim to be progressive and open if
you can't have these conversations
and hopefully it will go a long way
to get rid of some of the miscon-
ceptions surrounding feminism
and sexuality."
Gao said some campuses choose

to have separate showings for men
and women, though the Univer-
sity's audience of about 700 people
was made up of both genders.
LSA junior Tammy Lakkis, a
cast member, said she joined pro-
duction following encouragement
of the members of her feminist
awareness club, What the F.
"I consider myself a feminist,
but I've never done anything big to
really advocate for it," Lakkis said.
"This was definitely something I
could do that would take me out
of my comfort zone and make an
impact."
Lakkis said she was "completely
happy" with the way the show
turned out, which she attributes
to their practice schedule, which
started once per week in January
and increasing up to four hours
each day in the weeks leading up
to the performance.
"Until recently, the show was
a little rough, but I was sure that
we would pull through," Lakkis

said. "Everyone has such a pas-
sion for what we do and the issues
they represent, and I knew that
the audience would be sympa-
thetic people, so I knew it would
be fine."
Engineering junior Karl Gen-
dler, who was invited by a female
friend, said the proliferation of
the word "vagina" throughout the
play - approximately 123 times in
75 minutes - did not make him
uncomfortable.
"It was a wide spectrum of
experiences, so I feel like every-
one took something different away
from it based on their personal
experiences," Gendler said. "Com-
ing into something called "The
Vagina Monologues," I felt like I
kind of knew what to expect, but it
ended up being a lot more power-
ful than I was expecting."
"I wouldn't trust myself to ade-
quately describe it to anyone, but
it's definitely one of those things
that I think everyone should see."

cated and the chapter suppos-
edly had supplied him with the
alcohol."
The person taken to the hos-
pital was a pledge of the fra-
ternity, but it is unclear at this
point whether or not he was a
victim of hazing, Fox said.
Fox visited the campus from
March 17 to 18 and continues to
investigate while the chapter
remains suspended from activity.

"The chapter is not allowed
to hold any events or activities,"
Fox said. "No recruitment, no
new member education, they
aren't even supposed to be
having chapter meetings. The
fraternity still has their meals
and people still live there, but
while this investigation is going
on and while we gather facts,
they're not supposed to be hold-
ing any additional activities."
Fox said the reason for activ-
ity suspension and investigation
is to ensure safety.
University spokesman Rick

Fitzgerald said the fraternity
has been expelled from the
Interfraternity Council. He
added that it maybe possible for
the fraternity to try to rejoin the
council and normal Greek Life
governance structure, but that
this usually requires a change
in leadership and significant
reform.
The IFC executive board
released a statement Thursday
saying the chapter was expelled
Wednesday for "recurring
safety violations and poor risk-
management."

Students protests Adidas contract

United Students
Against Sweatshops
hold Diag flash mob
By MICHELLE GILLINGHAM
Daily StaffReporter
On Thursday, crowds across
the campus protested Adidas, the
sporting goods giant that holds
a $60-million contract with the
University. In a flash mob, a crowd
in 1980s clothing traveled across
the Diag, blaring "I Like to Move
It" to protest the company.
United Students Against Sweat-
shops organized the event to call
on the company to pay $1.8 million
in severance pay to workers of a
Indonesian factory - which pro-
duced University-themed apparel
- that closed last year after its
owner fled the country. The clo-
sure put 2,800 people out of work.
"We focus on working with the
administration to make sure that
the people that the University has
relationships with are upholding
their end of the Student Code of
Conduct," said Engineeringsenior
Carolina Madrid, a USAS member.
"That's where issues with Adidas
arise because they are currently
in violation of our Student Code of
Conduct, and we have a huge con-
tract with them."
"Adidas apparently owes $1.8
million,legally,in severance to those
workers. Adidas just refuses that
and are taking a stance that they

don't have to pay it," she continued
If the University were to cut
its ties with Adidas, it would not
be the first school to do so. Eight
other schools have already decid-
ed to remove the brand from their
schools, including Cornell Uni-
versity, Oberlin University, Uni-
versity of Washington, Rutgers
University, Georgetown Univer-
sity, College of William and Mary,
Santa Clara University and Penn-
sylvania State University.
The group is tryingto convince
University President Mary Sue
Coleman to refuse to renew their
contract with Adidas as opposed
to dropping them immediately.
Madrid said dropping the con-
tract after it expires is the easiest
way to part ways with the compa-
ny without facing any legal rami-
fications.
While the contract extends
until 2016, USAS member Abigail
Williams, a Public Policy senior,
said "it's up for renewal in 2014."
"This whole year our messag-
ing has been 'Cut the Contract'
to try and get it to stop as soon as
possible," Madrid said. "But we
have discovered that that's prob-
ably not the best route to take
because of all of the legal issues
and clauses in our contract that
would make that extremely diffi-
cult to actually carry through. So
we've recently modified our goal
to be 'Drop the Contract' with
Adidas and just not renew it."
In addition to the protest,
which was called "Work Out for

Workers' Rights," the group tried
other strategies to address the
administration. Writing letters
to Coleman is a monthly task for
these 15 student members. They
like to keep Coleman informed
as to what they are doing to raise
awareness for students about the
issues as well as whether or not
Adidas is continuing to break the
Code of Conduct.
The goal of Thursday's protest
was not only to deliver another
letter to Coleman in the Fleming
Administration Building, but to
alert others about Adidas' wrong-
doings.
Although other schools have
dropped Adidas, it would be a big-
ger reaction if the University were
to remove them because of the the
contract's size.
"U of M is mainly an Adidas
school," Madrid said. "We have a
$60-million contract with them.
Other schools that cut Adidas
don't consider it a big deal, but it's
because Adidas isn't as big to them
as it is to us."
The group doesn't suggest
cutting out school apparel com-
pletely, just moving it to another
company that doesn't participate
in sweatshop usage. They recom-
mended that Alta Gracia, a sweat-
shop-free brand that pays workers
living wages instead of minimum
wage, as the University's new big
contract. The group said not only
would this company be the more
humane route, but that Alta Gra-
cia is an equally good deal.

is it adding to the campus and
showing that students have
pride in the school, but it is
outlining an area that is easily
recognizable, even by words, to
another local person.
"Public art changesthe phys-
ical landscape of the spaces in

"It adds value and contributes
to the well-being to the com-
munity. It speaks to more than
just art appreciators; it can be of
interest to the general public."
Art & Design freshman
Hayden Nickel, a student in
Graf's class, agreed that pub-
lic art was important to her.
With her project idea "Always

was interesting to experience
from start to finish.
Although all of the projects
that were presented represent-
ed the visual aspects of art, not
all art is visual. Since the art
is public, however, it is better
when it is something that could
be seen by people in all direc-
tions, such as a sculpture.
"Public art is a visual, while
traditional art can just be a
sculpture," Seagraves said.
"The visual component inter-
ests the aesthetics of the base
that it creates in a public place.
The public space is important
(to have public art)."
Though the project was for
the students to be able to learn
how to plan and organize apiece
of visual art and to calculate the
costs of building a piece, it also
served as an opportunity for the
students to be able to become
acquainted with the city and see
what types of art currently exist
here, Seagraves said.
"It was a great opportunity
for the city," he said. "It was a
great opportunity for the stu-
dents, too. There is a city of
public art program, so it really
was great to make ourselves
available to participate."

Behind the plate,
Michigan's rock

By ERIN LENNON
Daily Sports Writer
In a game of pure physics, the
blink ofaneye or amisread curve
could be the difference between
a win and loss for the Michigan
softball team. Just ask sopho-
more catcher Lauren Sweet.
Behind the plate, Sweet's
responsibilities go beyond catch-
ing a ball and throwing it back
to the pitcher. Catchers must
be able to keep the ball in front
of them at all times, even in the
case of a wild pitch. Sweet has
been a brick wall for the Wolver-
ines, committing just five errors
in her role as starting catcher
- just three all last season. She
completed her freshman season
with a Big Ten Freshman of the
Week award and a .988 fielding
percentage. Inside the batter's
box, she finished her freshman
campaign with a .277 batting
average.
And while she may have to
scream a little louder through
the face mask, Sweet has the
responsibility of calling out the
count and calming her pitcher
down when the opponents reach
base.
"I'll go out there (to the circle)
and remind (the pitcher), 'Hey,
it's just you and me. Just think
about it in the bullpen as if it
were just you and me,' " Sweet
said.
When sophomore pitchers
Sara Driesenga and Haley Wag-
ner hurl a softball upwards of
70 miles per hour towards home
plate, Sweet's glove has been
there to absorb the blow. In the
trio's freshman season, Sweet
started 56 games - 50 as catcher
for Wagner or Driesenga.
As one of Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins's smallest and
most exciting recruiting class,
Sweet, Wagner and Driesenga
carried the Wolverines to a
Big Ten Championship and an

appearance in the NCAA region-
al final.
"They're very different pitch-
ers," Sweet said. "I've gotten a
lot more used to them this year
because I've been playing with
them for a year now."
With Wagner's early-season
injury, Sweet has had an oppor-
tunity to catch Driesenga almost
exclusively. Driesenga - recent-
ly named NFCA National Player
of the Week - has excelled this
season, pitching her first career
no-hitter and boasting a 1.48
ERA.
"We both have great con-
fidence in each other and we
complement each other so well,"
Driesenga said.
The two California natives
began their pitcher-catcher rela-
tionship in high school. Four
years later, their comfort level
with one another is apparent on
the field.
Moving forward into the Big
Ten season, the challenge for
Sweet and her pitchers will be to
keep hitters on their heals.
"It allows the team day after
day to adjust to the other, so
it makes for a tough series,"
Hutchins said.
Added Sweet: "It takes a lot
of work when the hitters know
what the pitchers throw. It takes
a lot more effort from both the
pitcher and the catcher, and even
the coaches in calling the pitch-
es."
The Wolverines will face their
first Big Ten challenge in their
home opener against Purdue.
For Sweet, a second challenge
of the weekend may be the run-
ning game. Purdue junior out-
fielder Lindsay Rains - who
leads the Boilermakers in slug-
ging percentage - has stolen 25
of 27 bases this season, while
fifth-year senior infielder Molly
Garst leads the team in steals
with 28. Thus far, Sweet has
caught five runners in stealing.

tainst No. 18 Washington and a double against Maryland on
rng a complete game and Feb. 16. She even added a grand

slam to her resum6 the next day

Driesenga has the ability to
affect the game on both sides of
the plate - holding teams to few
or no hits while driving in run-
ners herself. This makes for a
dynamic player who is a night-
mare to face. It's why she's the
first Michigan player to be named
NFCA National Player of the
Week since former pitcher Jordan
Taylor in 2011 - and Big Ten play
hasn't even started.
Driesenga has even more
confidence when pitching, with
sophomore pitcher Haylie Wag-
ner returning to the lineup after
recovering from an injury.
"We both have great con-
fidence in each other, and we
complement each other so well."
Driesenga said. "We know that if
something would go wrong, the
other is going to come in and get
it done."

Since having Wagner back, Dri-
esenga has pitched without being
the only pitcher that the team is
relying on. This has helped take
pressure off of both Driesenga
and Wagner - two pitchers who
are both worthy of being the ace
for the Wolverines. This has cre-
ated what Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins calls a "deuce" at the
pitching position, where there's
no clear best pitcher.
In addition to having a "deuce"
in the circle, the team is also
focusing on playing what it calls
"one-pitch softball." The Wolver-
ines will emphasize taking every
series and every game of the sea-
son one play at a time.
Michigan will start Big Ten
play with its home opener against
Purdue this weekend, with Dries-
enga looking to add to her Big Ten
Pitcher of the Week and NFCA
National Player of the Week
awards.

Positional
Preview
By SIMON KAUFMAN
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan softball team's fate in
the Big Ten rests in one left hand and
one right hand - those belonging to
sophomore pitchers Haylie Wagner and
Sara Driesenga, who share duties in the
circle this year. Here's a look at who will
be behind them on the diamond:
Pitchers
Left-handed pitcher Haylie Wagner had a monster
freshman year, posting a 32-7 record - a Michigan
record for victories by a freshman. The six-foot south-
paw was unable to startthe 2013 season due to an injury
but has made a smooth transition since returning March
6. Wagner has posted a 1.52 ERA, while holding oppo-
nents to a.205 average.
Right-handed pitcher Sara Driesenga did most of the
pitching during Wagner's absence this season. Dries-
enga, a member of the All-Big Ten first team her fresh-
man year, has 124 strikeouts this season - averaging
just under one per inning. Offensively, she has hit in the
clean-up spot in every game she has appeared in and is
second on the team with 25 RBI.
./

continue to be used in such a role.
Doyle, Sappingfield and Crum-
mey are all perfect in the field this
season. Doyle and Sappingfield
hit first and second in the lineup,
respectively, and both are tied
with 26 runs scored - a team best.

In the outfield, junior Lyndsay
Doyle will cover center field while
freshman Sierra Lawrence plays
left and junior Nicole Sappingfield
patrols right. Senior captain Jac-
lyn Crummey has made some spot
starts in right field and will likely
Freshman shortstop Sierra Romero has
been spectacular since taking over the
position this season. She leads the team in
hits (33), RBI (26) and slugging percentage
(.731) while batting third in the lineup.
Senior Amy Knapp moves to
third base this year after playing
shortstop a season ago. Knapp
has made a solid transition to the
hot corner, owning a .955 field-
ing percentage in 28 games this
season. Knapp has hit primarily
out of the last spot in the order -
helping turn the lineup over with
a .380 average and .444 on-base
percentage this year.

Lawrence has contributed from the
bottom half of the lineup, hitting
.315 on the season. The freshman
has also showed off her speed on
the base path - stealing six bases
without being thrown out.
An All-American her sophomore
year, senior Ashley Lane worked hard
in the off-season to improve her field-
ing, admitting that she has always been
more comfortable in the batter's box
than the field. She has batted mostly
out of the seven-hole but will occasion-
ally hit higher up. Her .568 slugging per-
centage is second best on the team.
Junior Caitlin Blanchard appeared in just
21 games last year after suffering an injury
early in the season. The first baseman is
batting .316 with 14 RBI this year. At the
beginning of the season, first base was a
position that was up for grabs, with Michi-
gan coach Carol Hutchins trying out differ-
ent options, but Blanchard has solidified the
position as hers for the time being.

Completing the battery is sophomore Lauren Sweet.
Sweet caught Wagner in high school on a travel team
and has adjusted well to being behind the dish for Dri-
esenga, too. At the plate, Sweet has struggled though,
starting the season 3-for-42 after batting .277 with six
home runs last year.

CCHA Tournament
against Miami
By MATT SLOVIN
ManagingEditor
It took the Michigan hockey
team nearly the entire season to
come up with its slogan.
Last year, it was "burn the
boats."
The new motto is equally sim-
ple, and now
it's written
on the white- Michigan vs.
board in the Miami (OH)
locker room.
"Go blue or Matchup:
go home." Michigas t7-18-

square off
in Saturday's CCHA semifinal
at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit,
148 days will have passed since
the teams last met. And if the
Wolverines fail to extend their
unbeaten streak to nine games,
they will be going home - with-
out a spot in the CCHA title
game.
Freshman goaltender Steve
Racine was between the pipes
for Michigan's 4-2 win over the
RedHawks on Oct. 26 at Yost Ice

Arena. The next night, Miami
salvaged the split, and the teams'
years went in opposite directions
the rest of the way.
"That was a long time ago,"
Racine said. "Obviously, they've
gotten a lot better since then.
They've had a great year, so I'm
not really thinking much about
that (series)."
Michigan's recent resurgence
elicited RedHawks coach Enrico
Blasi to refer to the Wolverines as
the hottest team in the CCHA on
Tuesday's league conference call.
"Over the years, it's become a
pretty good rivalry between us
and Michigan," Blasi said on the
conference call. "We feel that
Saturday will be no different."
Miami (17-7-4, 24-10-5) has
already wrapped up an at-large
bid to the NCAA Tournament
that begins next weekend, but
the RedHawks would like noth-
ing more than to erase Michi-
gan's tournament hopes.
The Wolverines, who have.
reached Joe Louis Arena and the
CCHA Championships for the
24th straight season, must win
Saturday and Sunday to extend
their record NCAA Tourna-
ment appearance streak to 23
years. The winner of Michigan
and Miami will meet the winner
of Saturday's contest between
second-seeded Notre Dame and
fourth-seeded Ohio State on
Sunday.
Since Racine regained the
starting job in net, he's gone 7-0-1
with a 1.98 goals-against average
and a .922 save percentage.
But the goaltending edge like-
ly belongs to the RedHawks as

their two freshmen netminders,
Ryan McKay and Jay Williams,
have been key to Miami's suc-
cessful season.
Though Blasi played his cards
close to the vest when asked
which goalie would get the nod
Saturday, it would seem that
Ryan McKay, who has played
five straight games, is the favor-
ite. McKay is 12-5-2 this season
with an unbelievable 1.20 goals-
against average and a save per-
centage of .954.
Michigan coach Red Berenson
sees several similarities between
the RedHawks and Western
Michigan, the latest victim of
the Wolverines' hot streak. Both
teams typically limit the number
of scoring chances given up. And
though both have high-end scor-
ing talent, Berenson said players
like CCHA Rookie of the Year
favorite Riley Barber and Hobey
Baker Award finalist Austin
Czarnik make the RedHawks a
bigger threat offensively.
"Miami prides themselves
on being a blue-collar team, and
they work hard every night,"
Berenson said. "There's a lot of
similarities (to the Broncos)."
The Wolverines haven't ever
lost to Miami in the CCHA Tour-
nament, but the single-elimina-
tion format of the semifinals and
finals lends Michigan little room
for error.
"It's playoffs, so every game
counts," said junior defenseman
Mac Bennett. "You can't afford
to take a game off. Whether
we're playing a three-game
series or doing one game, we've
got to come to play."

gan coach Kim
Barnes Arico has experience
coaching against the Wildcats. At
St. John's, she won three straight
games against Villanova, includ-
ing a 69-49 victory in her last con-
test.
Given her win streak and
familiarity with longtime Vil-
lanova coach Harry Perretta,
Barnes Arico feels confident she
will be able to prepare her team
adequately before Sunday's game.
"I was in (that) league for 10
years, and he was always some-
one that was a tremendous coach,
but an even better person and
someone you could always turn to
in our league," Barnes Arico said.
"I've gone and sat down with him
to talk basketball. I've gone and
talked to him about his offense.
So yeah, I know Villanova really
well, coach Perretta really well. It
should be interesting."
Michigan will have to get used
to contesting the 3-point shot
more than it has all year. Villano-
va ranks seventh in the country in
3-pointers made per game, aver-
aging 8.3. The Wildcats attempt-
ed 256 shots in the season - also
enough for seventh in the country.
"They play a unique style, kind
of like Princeton men of old, they
play five out," Barnes Arico said.

PATRICK BARRON/Daily
Senior guard Jenny Ryan called Michigan "OK at defending the three," and said
the Wolverines would devote practice time to improving before meeting Villanova.

"They play five out, they shoot
threes like crazy, they probably
take 20 to 30 more threes than
anybody else per game," Barnes
Arico said.
It's no surprise, then, as to
what Michigan has devoted its
time practicing this week in prep-
aration.
"We're OK at defending the
three, and we'll work on it this
week and be ready," senior guard
Jenny Ryan said.
Added senior forward Rachel
Sheffer: "I feel like we've faced
Maggie Lucas, one of the best
3-point shooters in the game
right now. We defend (senior for-
ward Kate Thompson) in practice
every day, and I'm sure she'll be
shooting up a storm in the next
couple days. Knowing that they
are a 3-point shootingteam, that's
going to beone of our main focus-
es in the next few days in prac-
tice."
Though they're making their
second consecutive NCAA Tour-
nament appearance, the Wolver-
ines haven't advanced beyond the
first round since 2001 - their last
NCAA berth before 2012.
After falling to Oklahoma
in the first round last season,
Michigan returned five seniors
who have carried the team with
their experience and scoring. The
seniors led the team to its second
straight 20-plus win campaign.
With such experience in hand,
it's no surprise that Barnes Arico

and company envision bigger
things this post season compared
to last.
"You're not just happy to be
,there anymore, you want to be
successful once you get there,"
Barnes Arico said. "The senior
class really wanted to create
something special, and they've
been able to do that. We don't
want to end here, we want to keep
going forward."
To move beyond the first
round, though, the Wolverines
will have to deal with the senior
duo of Laura Sweeney and Rachel
Roberts, who are the only two
double-digit scorers for the
Wildcats, averaging 13.9 and 1L0
points, respectively. Sweeney also
leads the team in rebounding,
averaging 6.9 per game. No other
player averages more than 3.8 per
game.
Meanwhile, Michigan boasts
three double-digit scorers in
Ryan, Sheffer and Thompson. The
latter leads the Wolverines with
14.5 points per game and is sec-
ond in the country with 107 made
3-pointers.
On the defensive side of things,
Villanova ranks 18th in the nation
in points allowed per game, at
52.3. Michigan stands at 42nd,
allowing55 points per game.
While a date with top-seeded
Stanford more than likely looms
for the winner, the Wolverines
are still just focused on the game
at hand and not looking ahead.

SOFTBALL PREVIEW 013
Again, Michigan is early favorite in Big Ten

By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
Daily Sports Writer
As the only ranked team in
the Big Ten, the No. 14 Michigan
softball team is a favorite to win
its sixth consecutive champion-
ship. The Wolverines (21-7) look
in form as the conference slate
begins, having won eight of 10
games, including an upset of No.
2 Arizona State. But coach Carol
Hutchins' teamwill face stiff com-
petition this spring.
Wisconsin (22-3)
With only three losses
through their first 25
games of the season,
the Badgers could be Michigan's
biggest obstacle in its quest for
the conference title. Pitcher Cas-
sandra Darrah has shut down
opponents all season with a 1.65
earned-run average and has com-
pleted 11 of 14 games she started.
At the plate, outfielder Mary Mas-
sei has averaged an RBI a game,
as she streaked through the non-
conference schedule with a .451
batting average.
Nebraska (20-6)
The Big Ten's new-
comers didn't treat its
-new conference too kind-
ly in 2012, winning 14 games and
finishing third. The Cornhuskers

have historically been an elite pro-
gram, winning18 conference titles
in the 35 years they've been affili-
ated with a conference. The Husk-
ers will meet Michigan for the first
time as Big Ten foes on April 26 in
Lincoln. A two-time Pitcher of the
Week last year, Tatum Edwards
has continued her dominance this
season, winning 12 games with a
L76 earned-run average. Nebras-
ka has an experienced leader in
Rhonda Revelle, the only coach
besides Hutchins inducted into
the NFCA Hall of Fame.
Iowa (19-8)
The Hawkeyes barely
cracked .500 last sea-
son but finished as the
runner-up and just two games
behind Michigan in the Big Ten.
Thanks to Kayla Massey, Iowa
hasn't suffered from another slow
startthis year. The junior platoons
with Chelsea Lyon in the circle
and also terrorizes opposing hurl-
ers with the second-highest bat-
ting average and most home runs
on the team. The Hawkeyes have
toppled four ranked teams this
season, including a 6-2 win over
then-No. 11 Louisville that ended
a 37-game Cardinal home winning
streak that stretched back to April
13, 2011. Seeking its first regular-
season title since 2003, Iowa could
play more than just a spoiler this
year.

Ohio State (18-8)
The last team besides
Michigan to win an out-
right Big Ten title, the
Buckeyes returned five pitchers
from a squad that won 31 games
in 2012. But Melanie Nichols, one
of the top performers last year,
struggled in non-conference play
and has seen less time in the circle
as a result. A high-octane offense
doesn't hit for power, but it fea-
tures five players batting above
.300. Of them, Cammi Prantl has
perhaps impressed the most. The
freshman utility player boasts a
.400 clip and started all 26 non-
conference games.
Minnesota (17-10)
Even the Big Ten's
best sluggers might find
themselves swinging
at thin air against the Gophers'
pitching, which has already no-
hit three teams this season. With
a 1.18 earned-run average and 161
strikeouts through 22 appearanc-
es, Sara Moulton has flummoxed
opponents all year. Utility player
Kaitlyn Richardson has been on
fire in 2013 and leads the team
with an astounding .474 batting
average, but she's a bit of a double-
edged sword as she's committed
more errors (nine) than any other
Gopher. And besides Richardson
and shortstop Tyler Walker, no
Minnesota batter hits above .250.

Northwestern (14-10)
A perennial contender
for the Big Ten crown,
the Wildcats opened
the season with five consecu-
tive losses, but a win over then-
No. 4 Tennessee highlights their
improvement since then. Having
led Northwestern for 12 years
alongside her twin sister, coach
Kate Drohan recently earned her
400th victory with the program.
Drohan guided her team to back-
to-back Women's College World
Series semifinal appearances in
2006-07 and might have the talent
to do it again. The Wildcats are the
only team in the Big Ten with two
players on the Player of the Year
Watch List in shortstop Emily
Allard and third baseman Marisa
Bast, and Northwestern will keep
piling on wins if the sluggers heat
up at the plate.
Michigan State (14-13)
After struggling
through their non-con-
ference slate in 2012, the
Spartans didn't find themselves
on the positive end of the score-
board for the rest of the season
and went winless in the Big Ten.
But the Spartans should steal at
least a couple of games this year.
Michigan will recognize most of
its rivals' key players - outfielder
Kylene Hopkins and pitcher Kelly
Smith are both upperclassmen -

but Michigan State has added few
new faces. One of just three fresh-
man, Dani Goranson is the Spar-
tans' go-to reliever and gives them
a little extra depth on the circle.
IIJ Indiana (15-14)
The Hoosiers return
most of the key pieces
of a team that finished
fourth in the conference last year,
including infielders Amanda Wag-
ner and Shannon Cawley. But the
veteran experience hasn't trans-
lated into big non-conference
wins, as Indiana has struggled
against ranked competition. In
one five-game road trip to Cali-
fornia, the Hoosiers went winless
and were outscored, 36-7. Indiana
might have found a third weapon
in infielder Breanna Saucedo, who
has fully recovered from a foot
injury in 2012 and batted over .500
in her first six games this season.

a result, Shelese Arnold has seen
more time in the circle. Illinois is
solid defensively - nine players
boast a perfect fielding percent-
age - but has been uncompeti-
tive against Top-25 opponents
this year and will likely find itself
near the bottom of the conference
standings come May.
Purdue (11-15)
Pitching is key to a
team's success, and it
might be instrumental to
the Boilermakers' downfall. While
their lineup includes seven people
batting over .300, none of Pur-
due's pitchers have an earned-run
average below 3.40. Still, the Boil-
ermakers have quick-strike abil-
ity, having blasted 30 home runs
so far this year. Catcher Danielle
Fletcher's patience at the plate has
helped her knock eighthome runs,
and she also hits for average (302).

F Illinois (10-12) Penn State (7-16)
MIL S Despite a disappoint- Purdue should be glad
ing 2012 campaign, the (0 its pitching isn't as bad as
Fighting Illini made Penn State's. No hurler
history by becoming the first has an earned-run average below
conference team in 11 years to four, theunit as awhole allows 7.12
defeat Michigan twice in a sea- runs per seven innings and the
son in Ann Arbor. Pitcher Pepper Nittany Lions have surrendered
Gay shut down the Wolverines 10 or more runs seven times this
en route to earning All-Big Ten season. Don't expect Penn State
honors, but she hasn't repeated to finish in the top half of a tough
that success so far this season. As Big Ten.

With Burke struggling,
Hardaway answers call

By STEVEN BRAID
Daily SportsEditor
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. -
Eventually, it was obvious. Soph-
omore guard Trey Burke just
wasn't going to have his typical
offensive game Thursday against
South Dakota State. Without a
little help from someone else, the
Michigan men's basketball team
was Ilestined for another first-
roundupset and ashort trip home
from the Palace of Auburn Hills.
As the only starter with mul-
tiple years of NCAA Tournament
experience under his belt, junior
guard Tim Hardaway Jr. stepped
to center stage, and it was Hard-
away who single-handedly kept
the Jackrabbits at bay in the first
half.
Midway through the half,
South Dakota State had grabbed a
13-7 lead. Then something clicked
for Hardaway.WithSouth Dakota
State's point guard Nate Wolters
effectively shutting down Burke

from scoring opportunities, the
wings opened up. And, after
missing his first two shots early
in the game, Hardaway found his
stroke and gained a confidence
that never disappeared.
Hardaway scored three of
Michigan's next fivebuckets to
key an 11-3 run for the fourth-
seeded Wolverines.
"When Trey missed a few
shots, we didn't have many
answers at first," said Michigan
coach John Beilein. "Tim came
back and hit two huge threes,
deep, guarded threes and it
seemed to turn everything atthat
point."
Of Hardaway's 21 total points
- he tied with freshman forward
Glenn Robinson III for a game
high - 15 came from beyond the
arc for a 71-percent clip, and he
went 4-for-5 from deep in the
first half.
When Hardaway got hot, the
rest of the team seemed to fol-
low suit. Robinson and freshman

guard Nik Stauskas each made
crucial shots during the game.
Robinson took over in the second
half - 17 of his 21 points came in
the final 20 minutes - but Hard-
away's hot hand didn't disappear,
either.
Each time the Wolverines went
on a run to extend their lead in
the second half, Hardaway would
cap it off with an 3-pointer while
bringing the crowd to its feet.
"We see this in practice more
than we see it in games, and Tim's
always played with alot of confi-
dence, looking for scoring oppor-
tunities," Beilein said.
Added Stauskas: "This is huge
for (his) confidence. Anytime you
can see the ball go in multiple
times, that's great."
Hardaway isn't Michigan's
best 3-point shooter, and he's
been streaky from deep at times
this season, but on a night where
he'd go 5-for-7 from beyond
the arc, Hardaway could do no
wrong.
As one of three players in the
main rotation to return after
being shocked by Ohio in last
year's NCAA Tournament, Hard-
away understands the pressures
of a first-round game. And like he
was been able to do in New York
this season, Hardaway's confi-
dence shined through on the big
stage.
Hardaway credits his famil-
iarity with the arena - the Wol-
verines played at the Palace of
Auburn Hills in a game against
Oakland last season - for his big
performance on Thursday.
"Just coming in earlier today
when myself, Nik and (freshman
guard) Caris LeVert and some of
our bigs just come in here and get
extra reps out and just getting a
feel for the environment" helped
Hardaway get comfortable, he
said. "We played here before last
year so we kind of know what to
expect out of the court and out of
the rim. It feltgood."
Hardaway, and the entire
Michigan squad, hopes that con-
fidence won't falter.

After Burke scare, VCU
and Havoc defense await

AUBURN HILLS, Mich.
- With 11 minutes left in the
Michigan men'sbasketball team's
71-56 victory over South Dakota
State in the second round of the
NCAA Tournament, it looked like
the Wolverines were in trouble.
Michigan's star, its backbone and
floor general, sophomore point
guard Trey Burke, had fallen
hard to the floor, landing sharply
on the hardwood.
The initial concern, as Burke
lay on the court, was that he'd

After the
game, Burke said that he hit his
tailbone, elbow and a small por-
tion of the back of his head. He
never lost consciousness, he
insisted, and his head felt fine.
Before heading off to the cold tub
to try to remedy his sore tailbone
and elbow, Burke also mentioned
that he "got a little overdramatic."
The Wolverines held a com-
fortable eight-point lead, and, at
that point, Burke had only scored
four points on 1-for-10 shooting.
Out of necessity, the production
came from elsewhere.
Without Burke, the trouble
wouldn't have come on Thursday.
Instead, for Michigan, the trou-
ble would've been on Saturday,

to spark a 71-56 victory against
South Dakota State (13-3 Sum-
mit League, 25-10 overall) in the
NCAA Tournament Round of 64.
The Wolverines advance to
face VCU in the Round of 32 on
Saturday at the Palace of Auburn
Hills.
"The first shot gave me a boost
of confidence, and then I took the
next shot, and it kind of bounced
in - it got my emotions high,"
Robinson said. "Seeing the bench
jump up and down, I felt that I
couldn't miss. I've been getting up
extra reps, and they finally start-
ed to fall."
The freshman forward must
have gotten the message loud
and clear this week from Michi-
gan coach John Beilein, who had
stated quite emphatically that the
Wolverines (12-6 Big Ten, 27-7
overall) would need either him
or freshman guard Nik Stauskas
to be a consistent third scoring
option for the team to be success-
ful.
Robinson did more than that,
shooting 7-of-8 en route to a

team-high 21 points, including 17
in the second half, to go with six
rebounds. It was the first time
since the first week of the sea-
son that Robinson tallied three
3-pointers in a game, and Michi-
gan is now 18-1 when Robinson
scores in double digits.
"We say it to him every day in
practice: he's got to look at the
basket," said Michigan coach
John Beilein.
Junior swingman Tim Hard-
away Jr. also put in 21 points,
making five of Michigan's nine
3-pointers.
The highly anticipated match-
up between Burke and Jackrabbit
point guard Nate Wolters took a
backseat for much of the contest.
Burke finishedwithjustsixpoints
and seven assists, shooting2-of-12
from the field. Wolters didn't fare
much better, tallying10 points, six
assists and five rebounds while
connecting on just three of his 14
field-goal attempts.
Sensing that -the Wolverines
couldn't afford another slow
start, Beilein inserted freshman
forward Mitch McGary into the
starting lineup in place of strug-
gling redshirt junior Jordan Mor-
gan, and it paid dividends for the
young squad that has continuous-
ly struggled early in games.
McGary and Hardaway led
Michigan in the first half, taking
a 30-26 lead into the intermission.
McGary, who has been the
Wolverines' spark off the bench
all season, responded by provid-
ing energy to an otherwise lack-
luster start for Michigan. He
scored the first five points of the
contest for Michigan and entered
halftime with seven points and
four rebounds - two of which
came on the offensive glass. He
finished the game with 13 points
an nine ra dn

"Mitch brought energy, he
brought toughness, he brought
poise, and that's what we need out
of our bigs," Hardaway said.
While Burke sturggled to
produce on the offensive end,
Hardaway provided a nice boost
for Michigan. He led the team
with 12 points in the first stanza,
knocking down 4-of-5 shots from
beyond the arc.
Neither Burke nor Wolt-
ers could find much rhythm
in the first half. Besides a cou-
ple nifty crossovers by Wolt-
ers, neither player did much of
anything before intermission.
Burke entered halftime having
missed all seven of his field-goal
attempts, scoring just two points
to go along with three assists and
two turnovers.
"(Wolters) is a heck of a player,
he's very tough to guard because
he has a lot of length, he could
shoot and he's capable of getting
into the paint," Burke said. "I
think overall, we did a good job of
running him off the 3-point line
and making him take tough twos."
But while the Wolverines
were able to limit Wolters, they
couldn't seem to figure out a way
to stop Jackrabbits guard Bray-
don Carlson. Carlson repeatedly
knocked down open looks, tally-
ing 16 of South Dakota State's 26
first-half points. He connected on
six of his eight field-goal attempts,
including three 3-pointers.
Brayden finished the game
with a team-high 20 points and
eight rebounds, but with Wolt-.
ers struggling the Jackrabbits
had no counter for a Michigan
offense clicking on all cylinders.
The Wolverines shot better than
5o percent from the field and 4o
percent from beyond the arc, the
first time they've done so in nearly
tu mnthc

Sophomore guard Trey Burke was hurt in the second half but soon returned.

"Havoc" defense, a full-court
press employed after most made
baskets and dead balls. The goal
is to trap the ball in the corner or
pressurethe primary ballhandler
into turnovers.
It's not just a gimmick -
"Havoc" is for real.
VCU leads the nation in steals
with almost 12 per game, which
is more than a full steal ahead of
the next team, Louisville. Its 8.0
turnover margin also tops the
country. In their second-round
game - which took place at the
Palace of Auburn Hills directly
after Michigan's game - the
Rams forced 21 turnovers in an
88-42 victory over Akron.
And it's not like the Wolver-
ines have a ton of time to prepare,
either. The Rams' Thursday game
didn't end until after 11:30 p.m.,
meaning Michigan essentially
has only one day to prepare for
them.
The Michigan assistant coach-
es split up scouting for upcoming
opponents, a task which obvious-
ly gets a little more complicated
in the hypothetical world of tour-
nament seeding. LaVall Jordan
was tasked with VCU, preparing

for the matchup by focusing on
the Rams' win over Butler - a
game they won by 32 points.
"It's a team effort to beat it,"
Jordan said. "Multiple ball han-
dlers is the key.... It's not compli-
cated, but it's more than you can
simulate or talk about before we
actually get out there against it."
Jordan mentioned that fresh-
man point guard Spike Albrecht
will probably play a larger role
on Saturday, as Michigan wants
to pair him with Burke to get
two primary ball handlers on the
floor. Besides Burke, the Wol-
verines' other starting guards
- freshman Nik Stauskas and
junior Tim Hardaway Jr. - aren't
known for their ball handling, a
glaring issue, especially against
a team that lives off its full-court
press.
Still, the key matchup will like-
ly be Burke, one of the best point
guards in the country going up
against one of the best defenses.
The Wolverines didn't need him
as much against South Dakota
State on Thursday, but they will
on Saturday.
Michigan's just lucky he was
being overdramatic.
