Two lawsuits have been 

filed in the past month over 
an alleged sexual assault at 
a 
University 
of 
Michigan 

fraternity party in January 
2016.

The first lawsuit, from a 

now-former male University 
student, was filed against 
several 
employees 
of 
the 

University of Michigan for 
wrongfully 
causing 
the 

student leave the University 
following the alleged assault, 
according to court documents.

“The Appeals Board applied 

an unconstitutionally vague 

or legally incorrect definition 
of the term ‘incapacitated,’ 
applied incorrect standards 
of review, and arbitrarily 
and capriciously set aside the 
investigator’s findings and 
conclusions, 
thus 
denying 

Plaintiff due process,” the 
complaint reads.

The second lawsuit, filed 

Wednesday by the female 
University 
student 
who 

filed the claims of sexual 
assault 
against 
the 
male 

student, seeks to block the 
male student from gaining 
readmission to the University. 
It charges that he is not 
respecting the terms of an 
agreement 
reached 
during 

UM’s investigation of the 
female student’s complaint 

Faced 
with 
a 
changing 

city landscape and student 
anxiety 
about 
high 
off-

campus housing costs, Central 
Student 
Government 
has 

begun 
exploring 
options 

for 
cooperation 
with 
city 

government to address the 
issue.

However, it remains unclear 

which specific policies CSG can 
realistically coordinate with 
city and county government 
officials on tht would alleviate 
off-campus housing costs, or 
even to what extent off-campus 
student rental costs have been 
changing.

CSG President David Schafer, 

an LSA senior, told the Board 
of Regents at their September 
meeting he hopes to start a 
dialogue between students and 
local officials on off-campus 
student housing.

“The issue of increasingly 

costly 
off-campus 
housing 

for students is an issue that I 
believe we’d be well-served to 
tackle together,” Schafer told 
the Regents, adding preliminary 
meetings with city and local 
officials have already taken 
place, including with Ann Arbor 
Mayor 
Christopher 
Taylor 

(D) and Washtenaw County 
Commissioner Andy LaBarre 
(D).

The median rate for rent in 

Ann Arbor has increased 14 
percent to $1,075 per month 
from 2010 to 2015 — even as the 
amount of high-density housing 
has jumped by 32 percent — 
according to the U.S. Census 
Bureau. However, this data is for 
the entire city and may not be 
reflective of the cost of housing 
for students specifically, most of 
which are clustered downtown.

Nadine Jawad, CSG senior 

policy 
adviser 
and 
Public 

Policy senior, said CSG does 
not yet have concrete data on 

off-campus 
student 
housing 

costs or trends, noting they 
are 
conducting 
preliminary 

research to collect this data. 
She added, however, that the 
initiative began in response to 
numerous students approaching 
CSG with concerns pertaining 
to the cost of off-campus living.

“I strongly believe that when 

students come and talk with 
us, their concerns should be 
top priority,” she said. “We 
wanted students to have a better 
understanding of off-campus 

housing 
dynamics 
in 
Ann 

Arbor because a lot of students 
expressed that the current 
rental prices were an issue.”

A major hurdle for CSG’s 

initiative will be limits on the 
city of Ann Arbor’s ability to 
exert control on housing prices, 
which includes rental costs 
for students. State law bars 
municipalities from setting rent 
controls on private landlords, 
and while housing subsidies 
and incentives are possible, they 
cannot be made exclusive for a 
specific demographic, such as 
students.

Schafer acknowledged these 

challenges and that meaningful 
change may take well over a 
year to take effect. Nonetheless, 
he said he hopes to see greater 
student involvement in City 
Council decisions, especially 
ones about housing.

“I think students would be 

well served to know their innate 
powers as a state constituency,” 
said Schafer. “Making their 
voices heard is so important 
because when students come 
together, 
when 
students 

mobilize, when they make their 
voices heard — that can lead to 
tangible, positive results for the 
general constituency.”

CSG is planning to initiate 

public 
dialogue 
between 

students and officials at a panel 
Oct. 13 in the Union, with 
speakers from City Council, 
the University of Michigan 
and other officials. Executive 
members 
of 
the 
housing 

The average Central Student 

Government member is most 
likely to be a wealthy, white, 
heterosexual 
male, 
according 

to results of a comprehensive 
demographic 
self-survey 

released Wednesday morning.

The report, which breaks 

down the assembly by a number 
of factors including race, gender, 
sexuality and family income, 
comes after campaign promises 
from 
CSG 
President 
David 

Schaefer, an LSA senior, to bolster 
diversity 
efforts 
in 
student 

government. CSG assessed the 
makeup of its membership in 
comparison 
to 
Engineering 

Student 
Government, 
LSA 

Student Government and the 
University as a whole.

In 
the 
breakdown 
of 

demographics 
presented 
in 

the report, 69.8 percent of CSG 
self-identify as white. This is 
compared to 64.7 percent of LSA 
student government, 47.6 percent 
of Engineering representatives 
and 56.2 percent of the entire 
student body that claim the same 
identity, according to the report.

GRANT HARDY/Daily

LSA sophomore Chanelle Miles discusses how the recent events at EMU’s campus have impacted her at a speakout on the Diag Wednesday.

About 150 students gathered on 

the Diag Wednesday night for a 
speakout held in response to recent 
incidents of police brutality and 
racism both across the nation and 
locally.

The event was hosted by the 

University of Michigan chapter of 
the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People 
and the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

The speak out, emceed by 

University 
NAACP 
chapter 

president Travis Jones III, an LSA 
senior, began with a crowd reprisal 
of “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” 

referred to by event organizers as 
the Black national anthem.

“In this past week, we have 

witnessed on our campus, within 
this community, and in the country, 
that racism is alive and well,” Jones 
said. “This isn’t our first one, and it 
won’t be our last one.”

Organizers said they planned 

the speakout to commemorate the 

fatal shootings of three black males 
and recent incidents of racism 
at Eastern Michigan University, 
located in Ypsilanti.

The event specifically aimed to 

remember 40-year old Terrence 
Crutcher in Tulsa and 43-year old 
Keith Lamont Scott, who were 
killed by police officers this week,

Many 
environment-focused 

organizations 
from 
the 

University of Michigan and the 
broader Ann Arbor area set up on 
the Diag for the annual EarthFest 
Wednesday. 

EarthFest began under the 

name “Energy Fest” in 1996 and 
has since evolved, taking on its 
current name in 2010 with the 
establishment of the Planet Blue 
Initiative, an initiative from the 
University that aims to promote 
sustainibility. 

The 
University 
recently 

identified 
four 
campus 

sustainability 
goals 
around 

climate action, waste prevention, 
healthy 
environments 
and 

community awareness. These 
goals are both guiding principles 
for the University, as well as 
concrete objectives to be fully 
implemented by 2025.

For 
example, 
the 
Health 

Environments 
goal 
mandates 

that the University must protect 
Huron River water quality by 
working to minimize runoff.

Ford Motor Company’s new 

partnership with the Univer-
sity of Michigan aims to have 
self-driving cars ready for large 
scale commercial use by 2021, 
according to Ford’s website.

The 
Dearborn-based 
car 

company has worked with the 
University in the past on auton-
omous vehicle research, most 
notably with the driverless car 
testing site Mcity on North 
Campus.

The 
Board 
of 
Regents 

approved the design plan for 
a $75 million facility during 
their September meeting and 
Ford announced it will be leas-
ing the fourth floor of the new 
building. The project is set to be 
completed in September 2019, 
according to Jessy Grizzle, the 
University’s director of robot-
ics.

A major perk of the new facil-

ity is that professors, graduate 

students 
and 
undergraduate 

students can work together in 
one space. Currently, the robot-
ics faculty works in various 
departments and is located in 
five separate buildings, through 
a staff of approximately 20.

Grizzle said the new building 

will bring researchers together 
through 
collaborative 
spac-

es, encouraging group work 
and fostering communication 
among team members.

“We will have startup-style 

collaboration space, think Uber 
and Google, where faculty and 
students can mingle when they 
need a break,” Grizzle said. 
“That is where crazy ideas 
get bantered back and forth, 
sometimes leading to a break-
through.”

Designing 
technology 
for 

autonomous vehicles is one of 
several efforts that will take 
place at the robotics building 
in upcoming years. The robot-
ics team is also developing 
prosthetic limbs that have the 
potential to be controlled by the 

brain, an autonomous wheel-
chair that can sense obstacles 
and walking robots.

“The facility will be spec-

tacular,” Grizzle said. “Imagine 
a three story tall space where 
drones can fly. Imagine a large-
legged robot laboratory with 
access to an outdoor robot play 
pen that makes the Wave Field 
look like a piece of cake.”

Grizzle stressed the partner-

ship is extremely beneficial to 
both the University and Ford.

“Ford wants access to out-

standing 
graduate 
students 

and new research approaches,” 
Grizzle said. “Faculty want 
access to new research prob-
lems and industrial insight into 
what is really important.”

Overall, Grizzle said the 

building will be a massive asset 
to the robotics department and 
will contain two classrooms 
and office spaces for 25 to 30 
faculty, about 20 postdoctoral 
researchers and 150 Ph.D. stu-
dents.

University Assistant Profs. 

Matthew 
Johnson-Roberson 

and Ram Vasudevan will be co-
leading the Ford and UM auton-
omous vehicle research project.

The new building could help 

Ford reach the goal as soon as 
possible, 
Johnson-Roberson 

said.

“What we are going to be 

doing is figuring out more about 
the technology that currently 
exists and what still needs to 
be developed so that we can 
operate autonomous vehicles 
safely on public roads in 2021,” 
he said.

Charles Barto, a recent engi-

neering alum of the University, 
works as a research assistant 
for Vasudevan’s and Johnson-
Roberson’s lab, said he believes 
the partnership with Ford at 
the new robotics facility could 
lead to new opportunities for 
researchers in the field.

“It looks like it is going to be 

a good investment for the Uni-
versity,” Barto said. “There are 
a lot of new research groups 
that are looking into moving 
into that new facility.”

The Companion app, created 

last year by a group of University of 

Michigan students and launched 

to the public last year, is now 

beginning to receive international 

attention.

The app, created by a team 

of five Ross School of Business 

students, won the Michigan 

Business Challenge, including 

$25,000. Originally launched in 

November 2015 by now-Business 

alumni Danny Freed, Nathan 

Pilcowitz, Jake Wayne and Katie 

Reiner and now-Business senior 

Lexie Ernst, was created to assist 

students as they walk home late at 

night, allowing friends and family 

to virtually track them as they walk 

home and make sure they arrive 

safely. The app had a small launch 

last November with an iOS version 

for students at the University, and 

has achieved high popularity.

“I could never have possibly 

imagined Companion’s explosive 

hyper-growth in the past month, 

and I’m so excited to be a part 

of a thriving startup that aims 

to increase safety on college 

campuses,” Ernst said in a press 

release.

The app garnered 500,000 new 

users during the first week after its 

launch. The app works by asking the 

user to plug in their destination 

and then calculates the estimated 

time it will take the user to reach 

their destination. Should the user 

take a longer than normal time 

to walk, the app will contact the 

designated “companion” for the 

person walking back. Besides 

showing the path of the user 

walking home, the app utilizes 

built-in sensors in the phone to 

notice changes — such as a change 

in pace of the person walking or if 

the headphones come out. If these 

sudden changes happen, the app 

asks the user if they feel all right.

After initial success on the 

University’s campus, enough 

universities and colleges 

approached the Companion team 

about the app that they decided to 

make it public, offering it to any user 

through iOS and Android.

 

University faculty and staff have 

also taken notice of the possibilities 

the app could have, suggesting 

features such as why walkers 

pressed the “I feel nervous” button. 

Diane Brown, information officer 

for the University’s Department of 

Public Safety and Security, told the 

Detroit Free Press she wants to use 

the app to help improve campus 

safety.

affordability initiative, such as 
Jawad, are aiming to start with 
events that will then lead to other 
projects for the year.

Jawad said CSG also plans 

to talk to about housing issues 
associated 
specifically 
with 

high rises going forward and 
has contacted Tower Plaza and 
Zaragon West to ask questions 
about density.

Ann Arbor resident Ken Clein 

— who chairs the city Planning 
Commission — said there is no 
“silver bullet” to remedy high 
costs of living, but listed several 
options that are often discussed 
by the Planning Commission and 
city government.

These 
options 
include 

incentives for developers to create 
more low-rent housing, increasing 
the amount of property available 

for residential development and 
allowing the construction of low-
density accessory dwelling units 
on existing residential plots. Clein 
noted that these measures can 
only be applied to the city housing 
market as a whole, and cannot be 
specifically targeted at students.

The willingness of property 

developers to lower rents for 
students in response to external 
factors will also be crucial.

Craig Wack, public relations 

director at EdR housing, which 
manages several properties in Ann 
Arbor, said large student housing 
projects in college towns tend 
to compete based on proximity 
to other students and amenities, 
with price as a secondary factor, 
especially because many students 
receive rent assistance from their 
parents.

“In the surveys we’ve had... the 

one thing that came back first and 
foremost is that students want to 
live where their friends live, they 
want to have that community,” 

Wack said. “Price is probably 
number two, a number of our 
students are paying their own way, 
but there are a lot of students who 
get help from their parents.”

LSA junior Ellen Guerra, who is 

living in an off-campus apartment 
for the first time, wrote in an email 
that she’s found of the off-campus 
housing process frustrating.

“Figuring out student housing 

in Ann Arbor is outrageous: 
first, pricing is too high for what 
the homes offer. I know people 
who signed their lease 2 years in 
advance in order to secure a good 
home,” she wrote in an email to the 
Daily. “This makes finding housing 
extremely stressful if you don’t 
have connections to the people in a 
house you want or don’t have a set 
group of friends you want to live 
with.”

She added that pricing is often 

unpredictable, 
especially 
when 

utilities come into play.

“Finally, the prices are high 

and always become higher once 

you move in: I thought my place 
included all extra expenses but 
once I moved in I learned I needed 
to pay more for Internet, parking 
and electricity,” she wrote. “The 
idea of figuring out housing for 
next year stresses me out a lot and 
it’s a full year away (un)til move in.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Elizabeth 

Szeles echoed Guerra’s thoughts 
about off-campus housing.

“I think housing is expensive 

in general,” she said. “As a 
sophomore, I am thinking ‘let’s 
look at off-campus housing’ and I 
am doing that right now, and it’s 
still ridiculously expensive, and 
that’s with the meal plan included. 
I really wish there were more 
options.”

Szeles said she doesn’t know 

what to expect out of CSG’s 
plan to work with City Council, 
but added that she understands 
a project as big as one on the 
housing affordability might not be 
completed within her time at the 
University.

individuals in CSG and LSA SG 
identified as Asian, 9.3 percent 
and 14.7 percent, respectively. 
ESG, 
however, 
was 
42.9 

percent Asian.

A Michigan Daily analysis 

of CSG leadership conducted 
in 2015 found similar patterns 
in executive positions: seven 
men served as president in a 
row, a trend now continued by 
Schafer.

The gender gap in the full 

CSG assembly — 58.1 percent 
of members are male, 40.7 
percent female and 1.2 percent 
preferred not to answer — is 
slightly higher than that of 
the University’s breakdown of 
male students at 51.8 percent 
and females at 48.2 percent, 
according to the report.

The report also measured 

family 
backgrounds 
of 

representatives. 
Only 
9.3 

percent of CSG members are 
first-generation 
students, 

while 37.2 percent of the body 
comes from homes earning 
more than $250,000 a year. The 
University does not publish 
full statistics on student body 
income level.

On 
the 
whole, 
LSA 

and 
Engineering 
student 

governments 
were 
more 

diverse in every category on 
the survey compared to CSG, 

though both bodies are less 
than half the size of CSG.

Surveys of all three bodies 

were administered last week, 
and received a 95-percent 
response 
rate. 
A 
press 

release 
accompanying 
the 

report’s release emphasized 
transparency 
and 
accurate 

representation.

“Diversity 
is 
critical 
to 

ensuring that as a governing 
body, we are representative 
of every student on campus,” 
Schafer said in the release. 
“We look forward to analyzing 
the results of the report and 
conceptualizing ways in which 
we can better represent our 
various constituencies.”

Schafer 
made 
diversity 

a major cornerstone of his 
campaign 
platform 
with 

NewMICH, 
committing 
to 

extending 
the 
University’s 

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 
initiative into the assembly. 
The 
CSG 
executive 
team 

commissioned the report at the 
beginning of the school year 
as an initial assessment and 
benchmark for future growth.

“I think it’s not only going 

to hold us more accountable 
as an organization to improve 
our diversity in the long term, 
but it’s also going to allow us 
to possibly set objectives and 
measures 
going 
forward,” 

Schafer said at a meeting 
earlier this month.

Schafer was unavailable for 

further comment Wednesday 
afternoon.

Sustainability, said EarthFest was 
incredibly important in raising 
campus awareness.

“From our point of view we 

want to make students, especially 
new students, aware of the whole 
Planet Blue idea and what U of 
M is doing towards reaching its 
sustainability goal,” Keeler said.

Taylor Landeryou, a School 

of 
Natural 
Resources 
and 

Environment graduate student, 
was at EarthFest working at a table 
for her organization, UMBees. 
UMBees brings awareness to 
campus about the role of honey 
bees and other pollinators in the 

food systems. An estimated one-
third of all food is dependent 
on pollinators, according to the 
British Beekeepers Association. 
The group keeps six hives at 
the Campus Farm on North 
Campus and also hosts an urban 
beekeeping 
symposium 
in 

October.

Landeryou 
said 
she 
loves 

coming to EarthFest to bring the 
community 
more 
information 

about bees and other pollinators.

“We actually kind of use it as 

our Festifall,” Landeryou said. 
“We appreciate that opportunity 
and we also love being around 
all our neighborly Earth-driven 
groups.”

Members of the Food Recovery 

Network, 
which 
works 
with 

the University dining halls and 
other student organizations that 

serve food to reduce leftover 
waste, attended the event for the 
third year in a row. LSA senior 
Ryan Ouderkirk, in his second 
year as one of the Network’s 
representatives, said the group 
aims to find a more sustainable 
way to reduce leftovers.

“Essentially we are taking the 

leftovers and helping deliver them 
to the hungry,” Ouderkirk said.

During the event, students 

formed long lines to get their own 
succulent plants from the Matthei 
Botanical Gardens table and learn 
about 
volunteer 
opportunities 

at both the Gardens and Nichols 
Arboretum.

Jared 
Alexson, 
a 
Natural 

Resources 
and 
Environment 

graduate student, said EarthFest 
is a great way for the Botanical 
Gardens to connect with the 

student body.

“It’s a great way to promote the 

presence of the garden and the 
arboretum for U of M students,” 
Alexson said. “It’s this underlying 
theme of connecting people with 
plants and connecting people 
with nature.”

Students passed through the 

Diag throughout the day, checking 
out the different tables and being 
treated to apples and Washtenaw 
Dairy donuts in true fall in 
Ann Arbor spirit. Engineering 
senior Srivi Sridhar said she had 
never heard of EarthFest before 
Wednesday, but was pleased with 
the event.

“I 
really 
like 
EarthFest,” 

Sridhar said. “I didn’t expect it to 
be here, but there is so much. I’ve 
learned a lot.”

for him to voluntarily separate 
from the University.

The 
original 
case 
was 

investigated 
under 
UM’s 

previous 
sexual 
misconduct 

policy, which was modified 
in July 2016 to clarify several 
definitions, 
including 
on 

what constitutes consent and 
incapacitation, 
as 
well 
as 

change the sanctioning process.

The male student’s lawyer, 

Deborah Gordon, said Tuesday 
that she thinks the University’s 
choice 
to 
update 
the 
UM 

sexual 
misconduct 
policy 

acknowledges that the previous 
policy was unclear about the 
definition 
of 
incapacitation 

and intoxication. Because of 
that lack of clarity, she said, 
the original case against her 
client was unfair, because her 
client could not tell whether 
the 
female 
student 
was 

incapacitated.

“I 
believe 
I 
am 
going 

to prove the University of 
Michigan violated my client’s 
constitutional rights,” she said. 
“I cannot emphasize enough 
the University has admitted 
the [previous] policies are not 
viable under the law.”

According 
to 
the 
female 

student’s lawsuit, the male 
student agreed to a voluntary 
separation from the University 
during UM’s investigation of 
the female student’s complaint. 
Under a voluntary separation, an 
individual leaves the University 
but it is not considered an 
expulsion, and it does not show 
up as a disciplinary action on a 
transcript.

In a press release Wednesday, 

Jennifer Salvatore, a attorney 
from Salvatore, Prescott and 
Porter representing the female 
student, said the male student’s 
lawsuit breaks the terms agreed 
to by her client during UM’s 
investigation process.

“It’s unfortunate that my 

client had to turn to the courts 
to enforce an agreement that 
the defendant said he would 
honor,” Salvatore said.

Salvatore’s 
assistant 
said 

the attorney was unavailable 
for 
further 
comment 
on 

Wednesday.

The 
female 
student’s 

complaint alleges that during 
the January 2016 fraternity 
party, the male student took the 
plaintiff to his bedroom, where 
he removed all of her clothing. 
The female student states she 
told him, “No sex,” but that 
he both vaginally and orally 
assaulted her.

The female student’s victim 

statement, provided by her 
lawyers, says a female witness 
and her friends who walked into 
the male student’s room helped 
her home after the incident, and 
that later that night she went 
to the hospital, where doctors 
performed a rape kit.

In response to the female 

student’s lawsuit, Gordon said 
she thinks the female student’s 
claims have no value and are 
based on threats.

University 
spokesperson 

Rick Fitzgerald said he has 
nothing to add on the lawsuit 
filed Wednesday morning by 
the female student.

Employees named in the 

male student’s case against the 
University include David Baum, 
assistant dean of the University 
Law School, Rackham student 
Tabitha Bentley, Nadia Bazzy, 
assistant director of the Office 
of Student Resolution and E. 
Royster Harper, vice president 
for student life.

The 
connection 
of 
these 

individuals to the case is not 
specified in the documents, 
but the boards used to review 
sanctions in the University’s 
process of investigating sexual 
assault claims are typically 
composed of a mix of professors 
and students.

Under the University’s new 

policy, those review boards and 

the overall review process have 
changed in several ways.

In particular, the appeals 

process has moved from a sole 
representative responsible for 
determining the sanction to 
a separate board, composed 
of two faculty or staff and a 
student. Under both policies, 
the sanctioning occurs after a 
review board looked at the case.

The previous policy also 

stated that if the respondent 
and complainant agreed to a 
sanction without appealing, the 
agreement would be binding 
and the respondent would be 
required to fulfill the sanctions 
or 
interventions 
included. 

Neither 
complainant 
nor 

respondent would be permitted 
to appeal the sanction if the 
parties agree to the sanctioning.

Under 
the 
new 
policy, 

if either the respondent or 
claimant takes issue with the 
sanctions, they can appeal to an 
external, third-party reviewer, 
chosen by the office of the 
general counsel and the vice 
president for student life.

This 
story 
has 
been 

updated

responses 

from representatives for the 
University 
and

female 

student. This is a developing 
story, check back for more

as well as the death of 13-year 
old Tyree King, who was shot by 
police earlier this month.

“The purpose of The Speak 

Out is to uplift the community 
overall,” the NAACP wrote in 
an earlier email statement to the 
Daily.

Speakers also spoke on an 

incident at EMU early Tuesday 
morning, when staff members 
discovered 
racial 
slurs 
and 

the letters “KKK” painted on 
buildings. Later that day, more 
than 150 protesters marched 
to the home of EMU president 
James Smith, where he delivered 
a statement with other campus 
officials, according to the Detroit 
Free 
Press. 
EMU 
students 

present at the speakout claimed 
more graffiti was discovered 
Wednesday morning as well.

The 
University’s 
Black 

Student Union tweeted videos of 
its members standing alongside 
other community members at 
the protest Tuesday at EMU, 
and much of Wednesday night’s 
remarks 
centered 
around 

solidarity with Black students at 
EMU.

Darius Anthony, president 

of the NAACP chapter at EMU, 
addressed the crowd about the 
importance of protest on both 
campuses.

“We shut shit down, that’s 

what we do,” Anthony said, 
referring to a rally Tuesday that 
blocked traffic on Washtenaw 
Avenue.

During the speakout, Kyla 

Fordham, another member of 
the EMU NAACP, applauded 

University 
students 
for 

demonstrations 
on 
UM’s 

campus, and urged them to band 
together with EMU students.

“We 
have 
questions...how 

they always got security cameras 
to give us traffic tickets, but 
not to figure out who did that 
graffiti?” she said. “But we’ll 
encourage one another because 
y’all are right next door to us. It 
doesn’t take an organization to 
change things, it starts in your 
classrooms and it starts with 
yourselves.”

Speakers also discussed issues 

surrounding diversity at the 
University at large, including 
campus climate and resources 
afforded to Black students. In 
recounting racially insensitive 
remarks made by a professor 
earlier this week, LSA senior 
Dorian 
Ballard 
highlighted 

the current historically low 
enrollment of Black students at 
the University.

“We’re only 4 percent here, 

but we’re the best 4 percent,” she 
said.

Black Student Union speaker 

Diego Zimmerman, a Music, 
Theater & Dance junior, reflected 
on the recurring nature of fatal 
shootings of African-Americans 
at the hands of police officers. 
Above all, Zimmerman stressed, 
the Black community needs self-
love.

“What if I’m next?” he asked. 

“When I see you, with your 
melanin and natural hair...I am 
extremely happy. When someone 
tries to take our lives away from 
us without out permission, I am 
extremely angry. But...I love you 
and that anything you need, we 
are here for you.”

Breaking down oppressive period culture 

ASHLEY ZHANG | COLUMN

ANTHONY LABONTE | CARTOON

Entering my 22nd year of existence

ROLAND DAVIDSON | COLUMN

“I 

love girls,” my friend 
once proclaimed as she 
exited the bathroom. “I 

didn’t have a pad, and five girls 
offered me one.”

It’s a classic girl bonding 

moment and the best ice breaker 
there 
is: 
One 
girl 

bemoans the arrival 
of Mother Nature’s 
monthly gift, and she 
can generally expect 
myriad 
responses, 

ranging from groans 
of empathy to favorite 
cramp-eradicating 
tips to “Oh my gosh, 
me too!” from female 
acquaintances turned 
fast 
friends. 
All 

connected by shared pains and 
discomforts, 
“sisterhood” 
has 

never felt so real.

However, these conversations 

rarely stretch beyond the realm 
of sleepovers, dormitories and 
female restrooms. And perhaps 
that 
uncommonness 
is 
the 

reason heated discussions on 
menstruation bond us. When 
the media masks the messy 
reality of periods with smiling 
women in tampon commercials 
and a mysterious blue liquid 
that has little resemblance to 
crimson blood, the only people 
we can relate to are those who’ve 
experienced it themselves.

Enter Fu Yuanhui, the Chinese 

competitive 
swimmer 
who 

effortlessly shattered so-called 
“period taboo” at the 2016 Rio 
Olympics. “I just got my period 
yesterday, so I’m still a bit weak 
and really tired. But this isn’t an 
excuse for not swimming well,” 
she told an interviewer post-race 
with a frankness that garnered 
attention worldwide and instantly 
became hashtag relatable with 
girls all over the world.

The scrutiny was especially 

strong in her home country, 
where 
feminine 
hygiene 

product 
advertisements 
are 

banned during prime time and 
the tampon market is miniscule 
due to the misguided belief that 
tampons will break a woman’s 
hymen and take her virginity. 
Whether or not it was intended 
that way, Fu’s public admission 
of her period and the insinuation 
that she, an unmarried Chinese 

woman, uses tampons or some 
other internal sanitary product, 
was a Big Deal — not only for 
China, but also for me.

You see, I am 18 years old, 

and I have never used a tampon. 
It originated from a fear of 

potential pain and 
the unknown, but 
soon the years of 
avoidance 
flashed 

by until I was a 
legal adult, ready 
to 
embark 
on 
a 

camping trip into 
the vast wilderness, 
the dates of my trip 
coinciding 
exactly 

with the start of 
my monthly cycle. 

Images of bears picking up 
my bloody scent from miles 
away and coming to devour me 
in one mighty gulp haunted 
my dreams as I frantically 
conjured excuses for sitting on 
the beach while everyone else 
frolicked in the water.

The stress of breaking period 

taboo was enough for me to 
purchase my first trial pack 
of tampons and search up the 
“You’re going through puberty, 
now what?” websites I hadn’t 
touched since middle school. 
Unfortunately, my mother was 
not quite on board with the idea. 
“What are these?” she asked, 
picking up the Kroger bag I’d 
brought 
home. 
“Tampons,” 

I 
replied 
with 
nervous 

nonchalance. “Tampons?” my 
mother repeated, “You can’t use 
these; you’re not married!”

It was then I realized it wasn’t 

just my own fear preventing 
me from using tampons, but 
rather, the long history of a 
culture that heavily emphasizes 
sexual purity. As I argued 
with my mother on the innate 
sexism behind her statement, 
she countered with the closest 
thing to “the talk” (albeit full of 
euphemisms and uncomfortable 
avoidances) 
that 
I’d 
ever 

received. “There’s a … layer of 
skin in there that breaks when 
you use a tampon,” she said.

“Do you mean the hymen?” 

I replied. “Because that doesn’t 
break when you use a tampon, you 
know.” Still, she was adamant.

It was hard not to feel 

frustrated with my mother’s 
beliefs, but how could I blame her 
when she was raised in a country 
that turns married women away 
from the gynecologist, because 
pap smears and pelvic exams 
are considered too intrusive? 
The importance of virginity 
in China doesn’t stem from a 
particularly sexual or religious 
place. Rather, as Emily Wilcox, 
assistant 
professor 
in 
the 

Department of Asian Languages 
and Cultures at the University 
of Michigan, explains, “Chinese 
society tends to place greater 
emphasis on managing women’s 
bodily 
processes 
related 
to 

reproduction.”

According to Wilcox, Chinese 

women treat menstruation more 
seriously as a health issue and 
a limitation to their regular 
activities than women in the 
United 
States. 
Additionally, 

Chinese women take a month 
off after they give birth so their 
bodies can recover from the 
ordeal of delivery, a practice 
that translates to “doing the 
month.” And while traditional 
Chinese medicine has its merits, 
the attention to female virginity 
and the female body suggests an 
underlying sexism, as if the only 
thing the female body is good 
for is as a vessel for another 
human being.

In a country where virgins 

and unmarried women (who 
are assumed to be the former) 
are 
barred 
from 
receiving 

gynecological 
exams 
and 

discouraged 
from 
using 

tampons, Fu Yuanhui’s casual 
smashing of period taboo is 
somewhat of a statement, or 
even a catalyst for change. As 
innocuous 
as 
her 
comment 

may seem, it’s already opened 
conversations 
on 
Chinese 

forums about tampons and the 
misconceptions 
surrounding 

their ability to strip a woman 
of her virginity. Fu Yuanhui’s 
interview is a foot in the door, 
a centimeter crack between the 
secret realm of girls and the rest 
of the world.

A 

few weeks ago, I was in an 
Uber with a driver named 
Nick. He happened to be 

from Greece, but immigrated to 
Michigan with his family when 
he was a teenager. I brought up 
my interest in travelling there, 
and we talked about some of 
the best sites in the country, the 
rich culture and the fluctuating 
debt crisis. I said how amazing 
it would have been to live there, 
and he nodded, saying it was. But 
what struck me was when he then 
went on to say how America had 
done more for him and his family 
than Greece ever could. As we 
continued to talk, I soon realized 
his appreciation for this country 
outweighed 
my 
own. 
Nick’s 

sentiments, similar to many other 
foreign-born Americans, are at 
odds with many of the things 
Donald Trump has to say about 
immigrants in the United States.

Last 
week, 
Mr. 
Trump 

announced that President Barack 
Obama was, in fact, born in the 
United States. The Trump team 
blamed Hillary Clinton for the 
birtherism 
theories, 
accusing 

her 2008 campaign of starting 
the birther movement. However, 
history is not on Mr. Trump’s side. 
The Los Angeles Times traced the 
nominee’s opinion on Obama’s 
birthplace throughout the years, 
and up until his announcement on 
Sept. 16, Trump was anything but 
supportive of the president. Even 
after announcing his bid for the 
presidency in 2015, Donald Trump 
remained doubtful of Obama’s 
birthplace. The resurfacing of 
this issue, possibly another media 
ploy or (successful) attempt to 
cast the spotlight on himself, 
highlights a deeper problem: 
Trump’s immigrant discourse 
is dangerous to what the United 
States stands for. Within the 
past year, Trump has managed 
to alienate immigrant groups 
from all over the world. Now, Mr. 
Trump has again raised concerns 
regarding identity and origin and 
their collective place in American 
society. This continued disregard 
and severe lack of empathy for 
immigrant groups makes him less 
American than he once perceived 
our president to be. 

It has been said time and again 

that America is, at its core, a nation 
of immigrants. Our country’s 

motto, “E pluribus unum,” or 
“out of many, one,” highlights the 
nation’s diverse makeup. Trump’s 
words 
have 
continuously 

worked against this centuries-
old principle, disrespecting it 
instead of praising it. The irony 
of this lies in Trump’s appeal. His 
campaign has run on an “America 
First” mentality in an attempt to 
make him appear more patriotic. 
Well, “America First” includes 
the 42.4 million foreign-born 
immigrants who call this country 
home. Trump’s vision of “Make 
America Great Again” is a skewed 
one. His harmful rhetoric against 
immigrant populations like his 
“Build a Wall” slogan and plan to 
ban Muslims from entering the 
country is creating an outdated 
insider vs. outsider mentality that 
has no place in today’s globalized 
society. This hostile conversation 
between natural-born Americans 
and foreign-born Americans is 
destructive to the very ideals 
the country holds itself to. The 
nominee’s all-American image is 
disqualified by his refusal to see 
what makes America, America: 
its diverse population.

Statistically, 
immigrants 
in 

the United States, along with 
their U.S.-born children, equate 
to almost 26 percent of the 
population. As the daughter of 
two Indian immigrants, I’m part 
of that statistic, as are many other 
University of Michigan students. 
In a country with a substantial 
foreign 
population, 
Trump’s 

rhetoric is working against him. If 
Mr. Trump wants his campaign to 
be signified by strong patriotism, 
then 
estranging 
American 

immigrants is not the way to go. 
Immigrants, more often than not, 
embody the virtues that make the 
United States great: hard work, 
humility and a belief in America’s 
ideals. They come here to start 
over, to begin, to learn. America 
is opportunity, it’s hope, but for 
many of us, it’s just ordinary. I 
can admit that I take being an 
American for granted. But for 
immigrants living here, every day 
is a visible difference between 
where they came from and 
where they are now. This kind 
of perspective develops a great 
sense of gratitude, leading many 
immigrants to have a uniquely 
deeper appreciation for all that 
the United States has given them.

Donald Trump hasn’t outright 

insulted Greek immigrants like 

Nick the Uber driver, or Indian 
immigrants like my parents, but 
his anti-immigration rhetoric 
can make all ethnicities feel 
unwelcome in their own country 
— their own home. It’s important 
to note that Trump doesn’t 
often make the distinction in 
his comments between illegal 
immigrants who bring violence 
and crime to the United States 
and 
immigrants 
like 
my 

parents: educated, skillful and 
committed to giving their very 
best for their children and their 
adopted country.

Immigrants like the Khan 

family, 
whose 
roots 
are 
in 

Pakistan, are originally from 
another country but have lived 
a version of the “American 
Dream.” Trump’s words have 
grouped together all immigrants 
by continuously insulting them, 
showing a concerted effort to 
alienate those whose birthplace 
may be different, skin color may 
be darker or first language may 
not be English. In many cases, 
this simply means he is alienating 
those who tend to be the most 
appreciative of America. He has 
refueled the stigma surrounding 
immigrants and perpetuated the 
idea of a less tolerant America. 
The fact that their appreciation is 
being returned with racism and 
bigotry by a presidential candidate 
tears away at what actually makes 
America great: people who have 
come here seeking opportunity 
and who have lived it out.

The United States is a country 

of 
diversity, 
opportunity, 

freedom, hope and all those other 
adjectives that great leaders and 
great writers have continuously 
used to describe this singularly 
unique America. These are the 
ideals we hold ourselves to: 
accepting other cultures and 
religions, promoting tolerance 
and acceptance and realizing 
the vast contributions those 
with different backgrounds can 
bring to the table. Unfortunately, 
not all of us are promoting 
those words on the face of our 
currency, E pluribus unum. 
Trump is on a mission to “Make 
America Great Again,” but his 
own belittling words and blunt 
ignorance seem to be what make 
him all the less American.

I 

have a deep history of 
having social anxiety from 
totally innocuous things. 

One of my greatest fears is that 
the baristas at Espresso Royale 
will begin recognizing me and 
treating me better. 
Yes, this is extremely 
irrational. But at the 
very least, I can take 
solace in that I’m 
part of a great lineage 
of 
neurotic 
New 

York 
Jews 
(almost 

anything 
which 

draws comparisons to 
Woody Allen is a win 
in my book).

I have a similar 

relationship with birthdays. The 
idea of celebrating myself has 
always rubbed me the wrong 
way. It seems plainly narcissistic. 
(Whoopee, 
I 
don’t 
have 

debilitating, 
life-threatening 

arthritis from replaying Chrono 
Trigger! We’re one year closer 
to the inevitable heat death 
of the Universe!) I want to be 
celebrated, but not to be the 
subject of celebration (please 
someone objectify me). It’s a 
weird tension. Each year, another 
birthday passed and I grew a little 
more bitter that nobody threw 
me a birthday bash. I started 
to loathe birthdays and would 
tell friends this, so they stopped 
celebrating. The obvious loop of 
bad self-confidence formed and it 
showed no signs of stopping until 
a week ago.

This 
year 
was 
different. 

Over the past year, I’ve made a 
concerted effort to incorporate 
my coursework into my life 
outside the classroom. One of 
the most important things I’ve 
internalized through my classes 
on social justice is that nothing 
is given to you in this world. 
The future isn’t guaranteed to 
be better — we have to actively 
make it so. People need to fight 
against injustice to improve our 
communities. But this lesson 
goes beyond work as an activist. 
This year I invited a bunch of 
my friends to the Jolly Pumpkin 
for drinks and food. This was 

an anxiety-inducing process but 
at the end of the day, I made the 
right decision. I imagine there are 
a lot of people like me, wanting 
to be celebrated but not wanting 
to usher in the celebration. My 

advice: Think back 
to how you’ve gotten 
what you want in 
the past. I’ve never 
had a job fall into 
my lap; I’ve had to 
talk to professors, 
do 
research, 
send 

resumes, etc. Why is 
a birthday party any 
different? If you want 
people to celebrate 
you, you often have to 

make it happen.

While it’s possible to change 

some aspects of how your birthday 
is celebrated, others are totally out 
of your control. The way people 
wish you a happy birthday, for 
instance. I’ve noticed a gradual 
change in the electronic rituals 
which come with birthdays. I 
remember in high school waiting 
until midnight so I could wish 
my best friend a happy birthday. I 
remember drafting and redrafting 
birthday wall posts filled with 
inside jokes about “The Crucible” 
and trigonometry. That doesn’t 
happen 
anymore. 
Maybe 
it’s 

because of how Facebook has 
changed its interface. Back in 
the days of yore, Facebook’s chat 
feature was notoriously buggy, 
often 
deleting 
conversations 

midway through and having no 
ability 
to 
save 
conversations. 

These days, that doesn’t really 
happen. On the flipside, I’ve gotten 
some really nice handwritten 
notes from my friends (one year 
my housemate gave me an award 
for Most Times Attempted to 
Quit Compulsive Cough Drop 
Consumption). A lot of people 
extol 
written 
communication 

in our hyper-mediated world. If 
someone goes to the trouble of 
hand writing a letter, there comes 
a certain care, both about the 
contents of the letter but also about 
your relationship.

But to be totally honest, it’s 

hard not be nostalgic for that 

moment at midnight when the 
deluge of wall posts came in. 
Maybe it is part of how I’ve grown 
accustomed to the way that the 
internet has allowed for instant 
gratification. At the same time, 
it’s not as though those messages 
were shallow, and I have them 
forever, which is a definite plus. 
The internet rituals we associate 
with birthdays might just reflect 
larger patterns in how we use our 
computers and social media.

In the back of my head, I keep 

track of who has and hasn’t 
wished me a happy birthday on 
Facebook. This probably sounds 
neurotic. Spoiler — it is. Case in 
point: A girl who I had a fling with 
in the summer of 2014 wished me 
a happy birthday for the following 
two years and neglected to do 
so this year. (But she did like 
the following status: “the main 
reason im excited to turn 21 is 
that i can now disappoint a whole 
new set of women on tinder.”)

Maybe this represents the 

ways in which we’ve grown 
apart — which brings me to my 
last point: Birthdays are a chance 
to reminisce and reflect, both a 
singular, nondescript point and a 
check point. You see people fade 
in and out of your life (so-and-
so came to this sweet dinner 
with my family but didn’t even 
say anything this year). But at 
the same time, life doesn’t have 
an easy trajectory. People crest 
in and out of your life between 
those two poles; I’ve had really 
important relationships where my 
birthday plays no role. Birthdays 
are important but not the end all 
be all. A lot of people get worked 
up over them, justifiably so. It’s 
not as though it’s just another 
day. There are a lot of important 
markers in our lives ranging 
from the traditional holidays to 
graduations to initially random 
dates 
that 
acquire 
meaning. 

Perhaps the best way to describe 
them is to say that they’re just 
another important day.

Drevno, offense focus 
on correcting miscues

When redshirt sophomore 

quarterback 
Wilton 
Speight 

dropped back to throw on 
third-and-7 in the first quarter, 
the No. 4 Michigan football 
team showed a sense of urgency 
to redeem an early deficit. 

Instead, down 7-0 already, 

the Wolverines’ fate was about 
to get worse. Speight took a 
jarring hit to the right elbow 
from Colorado defensive back 
Chidobe Awuzie, fumbled the 
ball for a Buffaloes scoop-
and-score. Now, just over 
three minutes into the game, 
it was 14-0, and Speight had 
to slowly climb back up from a 
hit that kept him crumpled on 
the ground long enough that 
he didn’t see the touchdown.

“I was just like, ‘Wow, that 

hurt,’ ” Speight said. “I’ve 
never been hit like that before, 
because it was completely 
blind. I didn’t see it. I had no 
idea. I was kind of in shock too 
because I kinda realized what 
happened and they were in the 
end zone dancing.”

Though Speight did get 

back and played the rest of the 
game (minus one play on the 
following drive when redshirt 
junior John O’Korn was under 
center), he was shakier than 
he has been all season. He 
threw 16-for-30 for 229 yards, 
but came close to throwing a 
few interceptions as well.

After the game, he said he 

needs to work on his throw-
aways by making sure they’re 
“100-percent 
thrown away.” 
But from the 
looks of it, his 
biggest 
issue 

was getting hit. 

“Wilton 

is 
a 
true 

competitor, 
and 
he’s 
a 

tough 
guy,” 

said offensive 
coordinator 
Tim Drevno on Wednesday. “I 
think anybody who plays the 
quarterback position has got 
to be a tough guy. You have 
to take hits you don’t want to 
happen — we don’t want (it) 
to happen. But it’s how they 
respond. That was a tough hit 
on him and he bounced back 
up and led us the rest of the 
game and took us back from 
(being) behind and I’m just 
really pleased with what he 
did.” 

Speight 
was 
only 
one 

problem in a shaky offense on 
Saturday. Some of Speight’s 
issues were due to occasional 
lapses in the offensive line, 
and Drevno said that he 
needs to work with the line to 
make sure the blockers have 
strength to finish. Despite 
a few missteps, Drevno was 
pleased overall. Because the 

offensive line places a high 
intrinsic value on making the 
correct decisions throughout 
the game, the group has a high 
ceiling. 

“It’s important for them 

to be right, not to be wrong,” 
Drevno said. “They take it 
really, really personal when 
it’s not right. Really personal. 
Which is neat, that’s the neat 
thing as a coach. They take 
pride in their work.”

On 
top 
of 
rocky 
pass 

protection, the Wolverines’ 
two best receivers, fifth-year 
seniors Amara Darboh and 
Jehu Chesson, were hardly 
able to get open. Darboh had 
just two catches, one being the 
45-yard touchdown that gave 
Michigan the lead heading 
into halftime. Chesson didn’t 
have any receptions, though 
three of Speight’s passes were 
intended for him. 

Senior tight end Jake Butt 

ended up being Speight’s go-to 
guy, but even then, Butt was 
able to lead the game with just 
87 receiving yards. Because 
the passing game wasn’t up to 
speed during the first quarter, 
most of the Wolverines’ big 
plays came on the ground.

After 
struggling 
against 

Central Florida, averaging just 
2.9 yards per run, the running 
backs were able to help out on 
the ground with 168 yards and 
three touchdowns. 

Despite the increase in 

rushing 
efficiency, 
Drevno 

would like to see a more 
holistically 
stable 
offense 

overall. 

“I think it’s 

just, 
there’s 

different 
things,” 
Drevno 
said. 

“Protection 
was one issue, 
and you saw 
that. 
You 

know, 
maybe 

just a missed 
throw, maybe 
not the right 

position timing on the route, 
not being in the right spot. But 
you know, I’m pleased. Week 
before, we threw for 312 yards. 
There’s no finer throw than 
Wilton throwing the deep ball 
in college football. That’s hard 
to do.”

Luckily for Speight, he has 

some expert coaches in his 
corner. Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh and passing game 
coordinator Jedd Fisch both 
come from the NFL, where 
there’s no other choice but to 
fix the passing game so that 
deep ball can break free. 

“They 
understand 
the 

expectation level, and we’re 
going to get the passing game 
fixed,” 
Drevno 
said. 
“We 

will. With Jedd and Jim and 
myself, we’re going to make 
sure we get everything back 
up to speed.”

Brown not intimidated by 
Penn State’s spread offense

Don Brown would like to 

make one thing clear.

When Penn State and its 

spread offense visit Michigan 
Stadium 
on 
Saturday, 
the 

Nittany Lions shouldn’t expect 
to have their way. Not in terms of 
formations, not in terms of pace, 
not if Brown has anything to say 
about it.

“You’ve got to understand, 

these spread teams, what they 
want you to do is they want you 
to line up in one of two looks,” 
Brown said. “That’s what they 
want, and that’s exactly what I’m 
not going to do, OK? So let’s get 
that straight. We’re going to be 
extremely multiple, we’re going 
to stay on the aggressive side and 
that’s how we’re going to go.

“… These guys want you to line 

up in quarters and a static front 
and kick your you-know-what! 
We’re not doing that! And if it is, 
it’ll be over my dead body!”

Those are strong words, but 

right now, Brown is speaking 
from a position of strength. He 
heads the nation’s No. 19 scoring 
defense and No. 24 total defense, 
and if you take out the big plays 
that have so far burned the 
Wolverines, those numbers are 
even more impressive.

Brown’s 
reputation 
as 
a 

tinkering 
blitz 
master 
has 

proven apt so far. His unit is tied 
for third in the country in tackles 
for loss and tied for 10th in sacks. 
This week, he is expected to get 
an All-American back in senior 
cornerback Jourdan Lewis, and 
if Lewis does indeed return from 
a nagging injury that has kept 
him out all season, he could be 
a key boost to the man coverage 
Brown’s corners play.

Pro Football Focus’ college 

football tweeted Wednesday that 
the Wolverines’ current corners, 
senior Channing Stribling and 
fifth-year senior Jeremy Clark, 
are their top two at the position 
in the Big Ten, but Lewis’ return 
can help in an important way.

For all the success Michigan 

has had on defense, its opponents 
have found ways to beat it on key 
big plays. Central Florida did it 
on the ground. Colorado did it 
through the air. Lewis is one of 
the country’s best cover corners 
and, at his best, can virtually 
take away one side of the field.

Brown says, ideally, the big 

plays wouldn’t happen at all. He 
is confident that the unit will be 
better three weeks from now 
and even better three weeks 
after that.

“The arrow is pointing up,” 

Brown said. “Even on the couple 
run mistakes we talked about, 
right? It’s not like somebody 
was punching us in the mouth, 
now, and knocking us off the 
ball. It’s hit your gap, but when 
you’re moving, we’re subtly 
moving and grooving up front 
and learning how to deal with 
this block and that block and 
this guy is going from D gap to 
B gap to C gap. We’re doing a lot 
of that, and it takes a little bit of 
time to be right.”

Saturday, he’ll face a Nittany 

Lions team that plays with the 
same up-tempo style his last 
two opponents have used to 
occasional explosive success. 
But in both cases, the Wolverines 
have been able to regroup and, 
save for a handful of plays, shut 
down the spread.

Against 
Colorado, 
Brown 

said, he observed the Buffaloes’ 
tempo slow down based on the 
looks they saw from Michigan’s 
defense.

“When you’re coming enough 

they don’t want to get — it’s like 
hitting your head against the 
wall,” he said. “You don’t want 
to run a bad play into a tough 
look. And it’s not like we’re 
going to sit there.”

Normally, 
matchups 

involving 
a 
spread 
offense 

revolve around the question of 
how to defend its tempo.

But if Brown’s philosophies 

hold, the game breaks down to 
a whole other question, one the 
defensive 
coordinator 
posed 

rhetorically on Wednesday.

“Who’s 
controlling 
the 

tempo now?”

“We’re going to 

make sure we get 

everything back 

up to speed.”

Wolverines’ offensive struggles 
continue in fourth straight loss

With the clock ticking down 

and hopes of its first win of the 
season 
dwindling 
away, 
the 

Michigan 
men’s 
soccer 
team 
was 

desperately seeking a goal, with 
a corner kick in the final minute 
serving as its last chance to find 
an equalizer against Western 
Michigan. The ball flew into a 
crowded box and found the feet 
of sophomore forward Francis 
Atuahene, 
who 
deflected 
it 

toward an open goal. 

But the Wolverines’ first goal 

in more than 300 minutes was not 
meant to be, as the ball deflected 
off the inside of the left post and 
fell harmlessly into the hands 
of the Broncos’ 
goalkeeper Drew 
Shepherd.

“The hardest 

thing to do in 
soccer is score 
goals,” 
said 

Michigan coach 
Chaka Daley.

Right 
now, 

his team knows 
that better than 
anyone.

The loss, which sent the 

Wolverines to 0-5-3 on the season, 
was microcosmic of the season to 
date: close, just not close enough.

“We’ve 
been 
extremely 

unlucky in the past three games to 
hit the crossbar, have a last-ditch 
effort with 20 seconds against 
(Michigan) State and today hit the 
post again,” said senior defender 
Lars Eckenrode. “It’s extremely 
frustrating waiting for (luck) to 
turn in our favor.”

Early 
on, 
the 
Wolverines 

came 
out 
energetically 
and 

opportunistically, managing four 
shots — including several goal-
scoring opportunities — in the 
first seven minutes. 

But Michigan failed to muster 

another shot in the first half 
after that and allowed Western 
Michigan 
to 
become 
more 

comfortable in its possession and 
creativity. Stifling defense and 
physical play by the Broncos sent 
a visibly frustated and offensively 
out-of-sync Michigan team to the 
locker room with its fifth straight 
goalless half.

A 
rejuvenated, 
confident 

Western Michigan team came 
out of halftime with several 
chances before finally breaking 
through with the winner in the 
53rd minute. Midfielder Brandon 
Bye sped past the Michigan 
defense on the right side, finding 
fellow midfielder Diego Lopez in 

the box. Lopez 
calmly 
turned 

and slotted home 
the only goal of 
the 
game 
past 

sprawling junior 
goalkeeper Evan 
Louro.

“We just fell 

asleep 
on 
one 

moment in the 
game,” Eckenrode 
said. “And that’s 

what ended up costing us.”

For the seventh time in its last 

eight games, Michigan outshot its 
opponent, this time by a margin 
of 14-8. Yet for the third game in 
a row, and the fifth time this year, 
it failed to find the back of the net.

With 15 minutes left, Daley 

urged one final push, moving 
toward a three-defender, two-
attacker formation in search of 
that elusive goal. The increased 
attacking presence lacked fluidity 
in the final third, and despite 
scrambling to find seven second-

half corners, struggled to find 
goal-scoring chances until the 
last-ditch effort.

“I told (the team), ‘This is not 

easy,’ ” Daley said. “We’re not 
struggling soccer-wise, we’re not 
stuggling tactically, we’re not 
struggling technically. We have 
a little bit of a struggle going on 
mentally.”

But Daley remains confident 

in his team’s ability to turn 
things around. 

“There’s 
no 
quit 
in 
that 

locker room, there’s no quit 
in that coaching staff,” Daley 
said. “We’re proud people that 
represent Michigan. It’ll hurt 
tonight, but we’ll pick ourselves 
up and continue to work to get 
better and get to the next game.

“We fear no one. I’d be fearful 

if we got going.”
‘M’ stuck in search for elusive win

The Michigan men’s soccer 

team hoped to secure its first win 
of the season against Western 
Michigan on Wednesday night, 
but after another hard-fought 
battle and a 1-0 loss, a win still 
eludes them.

For most Wolverine fans 

who attend the games, the 
losing streak may be confusing. 
Some stats suggest Michigan is 
in the upper echelon of teams 
in the country, but the reality is 
much different.

Michigan (0-3-0 Big Ten, 

0-5-3 overall) is No. 1 in the Big 
Ten and No. 18 in the country in 
shots per game, averaging 16.14. 
It has outshot its opponents 
in seven out of its last eight 
games. 
Unfortunately 
for 

the Wolverines, their attacks 
haven’t translated into goals.

“I’d 
be 
very 
discouraged 

if we weren’t creating any 
chances,” said Michigan coach 
Chaka Daley. “This game could 
have been 3-0 in the first five 
minutes.”

The stats point to a serious 

issue 
with 
the 
number 
of 

chances and lack of goals.

Talent on the team does not 

seem to be the issue. Sophomore 
midfielder 
Francis 
Atuahene 

has 
23 
shots 
this 
season, 

and freshman forward Jack 
Hallahan has 19, and both have 
been standout players. But for 
some 
reason, 

these 
shots 

aren’t 
finding 

the net.

The 

Wolverines have 
a 
young 
front 

line, and their 
inexperience 
may be hurting 
their 
chances. 

And another loss 
in the books may 
be affecting the confidence of 
the team.

Every game has been close 

enough that one goal could 

have switched the momentum 
completely. In the first 30 
seconds of Wednesday’s match, 
Atuahene 
dribbled 
the 
ball 

at the top of the box and sent 
a through ball to sophomore 
midfielder Ivo Cerda, who shot 

it to the far post. 
All the Broncos’ 
goalkeeper 
Drew Shepherd 
could do was get 
a fingertip on it 
to push it away 
from the goal.

An 
early 

goal could have 
been 
exactly 

what Michigan 
needed 
to 

control the game, instead of 
getting stuck in the kick-and-
chase tactic. As soon as the 
Wolverines 
are 
down, 
they 

play some of their best soccer. 
However, they’ll need to come 
out with that fire from the 
beginning if they want to see a 
change in the final results.

“They came out with more 

energy and hunger than we 
did, which kind of caught us by 
surprise,” said senior defender 
Lars Eckenrode. “It’s safe to say 
that’s what got us in the end.”

Daley isn’t counting his team 

out yet, though. Michigan still 
has five Big Ten games to play, 
and he knows that if his team 
can peak at the right moment, it 
might have a chance to turn its 
season around.

“We’re 
proud 
coaches, 

we’re proud student-athletes 
to represent Michigan,” Daley 
said. “It’ll hurt tonight, but 
we’ll pick ourselves up and we’ll 
continue to work to get better.”

Student promoter lifts local talent

By: Christian Kennedy, Daily Music & Blog Editor


Over winter break of last 

year, 
while 
the 
University 

of Michigan was quiet in an 
empty Ann Arbor, LSA senior 
Ben Schechter was sitting on a 
sofa 8,308 miles away, in Cape 
Town, South Africa, listening to 
bluesy rock duo Abbey Grange 
play a set. Schechter was at The 
Waiting Room, a bar/balcony 
combination, which is the place 
to see live music in Cape Town. 
Situated 
on 
the 
building’s 

second level with a metal railing 
over which patrons can look at 
the street, the 60-ish-person-
capacity venue recalls Bourbon 
Street in New Orleans.

“I was the one of the only 

people there who were unrelated 
to the band. Just a random guy 
sitting on a couch, but I enjoyed 
every minute of it,” Schechter, 
a former photographer for The 
Michigan Daily, said. “I’m really 
looking forward to their future.”

He said that about every 

band during our conversation, 
but rather than coming off as 
rehearsed or customary, his 
words dripped with genuine 
excitement 
every 
time. 

Schechter, 
graduating 
from 

the University in December 
with 
a 
degree 
in 
General 

Studies as well as a certificate 
in 
Entrepreneurship, 
is 
the 

founder 
and 
sole 
employee 

of What The Sound, a music 
website dedicated to exposing 
up-and-coming artists to new 
listeners.

“I’m curious when I listen to 

bands what their story is, why 
they make music and whatnot,” 
he said. “I was on the East 
Coast visiting my sister, and I 
thought why not reach out to 
some bands.” Following that 
initiative, What The Sound built 
a catalogue with upwards of 30 
artist interviews over the course 
of the fall 2015 semester.

Interviewing Abbey Grange 

in Cape Town is far from What 
The Sound’s only international 
venture. The website’s homepage 
boasts a black-and-white world 
map with smatterings of yellow 
geotags congregated in South 
Africa, 
Australia, 
Western 

Europe and across the United 
States, signifying the locations 

of artists.

“One of the big things when 

I’m listening to these bands is 
that I want to see them live, 
but then, ‘Oh, they’re from New 
Zealand or from Russia.’ I think 
it’s really cool to lay out that 
information so when people go 
to What The Sound, they can 
think, ‘Oh, I wonder who he 
interviewed in L.A.?’ … press 
on L.A. pin, learn that way,” 
Schechter said.

An 
admitted 
lover 
of 

geography, 
Schechter 
hopes 

the visual guide to What The 
Sound’s 
interview 
archive 

encourages 
a 
boundaryless 

music scene:

“Depending 
on 
where 

people are from it can change 
assumptions about the area. If 
you didn’t think hip hop could 
exist in the middle of Australia, 
press on Canberra and check 
out these two female hip-hop 
artists, Coda Conduct. It’s a neat 
way of exploring new music, 
geographically and seeing it 
rather than pressing a drop-
down menu.”

Prior to What The Sound, 

Schechter was an intern at the 
Blind Pig after a semester of 
follow-ups with the Pig’s talent 
buyer, Jason Berry.

They 
still 
talk 
often, 

Schechter said, and two years 
after finishing his time at the Pig, 
Schechter finds himself working 
with Berry again, this time on 
“What The Sound Presents,” a 
series of showcases featuring 
local talent. The majority of the 
shows have happened at the Pig, 
save for singular shows in New 
York, Chicago and Hamtramck. 
What The Sound presented its 
first showcase in February and 
expanded to four showcases this 
semester, with the possibility of 
additional shows in November 
and January.

“In February I was like, OK, 

I know all of these musicians,” 
Schechter said. “Maybe not 
personally, but I listen to them 
and know their music. So, I 
figured I might as well reach 
out on a local level and put on 
shows.”

The criteria for landing a spot 

on a What The Sound lineup is 
simple: 1. Schechter’s got to dig 
your sound and 2. You’ve got to 
have the potential to grow. 

Last Friday, What The Sound 

presented a showcase of five 

hip-hop acts — four from Ann 
Arbor and one from Detroit, 
headlined by the rapper Munch. 
The first two acts of the night, 
Dude Madison and Broccoli, are 
both students at the University. 
The former earned his spot on 
the bill through hard work and 
being assertive and, of course, 
Schechter digs his sound. The 
latter, a buddy of Schechter’s, 
goes by many aliases and wore 
all black while serving up a cool 
Travis Scott cover. The third 
act, 
Awkward 
Theory 
from 

Detroit, played Ann Arbor for 
the first time.

The fourth act on the bill 

consisted of Ann Arbor rapper 
Isaac Castor and local band 
Arch Hotel. Friday’s showcase, 
Castor’s first with a live band, 
wasn’t the 21-year-old’s first set 
at the Pig.

“I’m 
trying 
to 
take 
my 

standard live rap set and do 
something different with it and 
make it creative and fun for the 
audience,” Castor said in a phone 
interview. “I think it went really 
well in that regard. Everybody 
brought out a lot of friends. I 
had a lot of fun. I definitely 
prefer to play with a live band. I 
don’t know if I’ll ever go back to 
performing without one again, 
so hopefully we can keep this 
ensemble going.”

After developing a taste for 

2Pac, Jay Z and OutKast as a 
child of the ’90s, Castor began 
writing music in Naperville, 
Illinois at the age of nine. He 
released his first mixtape six 
years ago and plans to release 
a new EP before the end of the 
year. In April he opened for 
rising rapper Lil Dicky (who 
played Hill Auditorium with Vic 
Mensa the same month).

But 
the 
highlight 
since 

dropping that debut mixtape in 
high school? A feature in XXL, 
one of hip hop’s most prominent 
magazines.

“That was a goal I’ve had for a 

long time that felt really good to 
accomplish,” he said.

Schechter discovered Castor’s 

music 
while 
SoundCloud 

surfing, and then the XXL 
write-up, which led to him 
eventually offering Castor the 
fourth slot in Friday’s show.

“(Ben) 
asked 
me 
a 
long 

time ago if I would perform 
at (Munch’s) headlining show 
and, Munch is the homie, so I 
was obviously down for that,” 
Castor said. “(What The Sound) 
definitely wanted us to do our 
part for promotion, but that’s 
cool because I would rather 
perform with people I know 
in the crowd, familiar faces 
who know my lyrics. That’s 
encouraging. What The Sound 
took good care of us, so shoutout 
to Ben for that.”

Castor met Munch (real name 

Maher Hachem) last year during 
Ann Arbor’s annual summer 
concert series, Sonic Lunch. As 
Castor played with a band for 
the first time, Friday was also 
a first for Munch — his first 
headlining show. A senior at the 
University, Munch grew up in 
the suburbs of Detroit, but his 
vibe is decidedly West Coast, a 
quality which carried into his 
2015 album, Beaches.

“A lot of inspiration for 

Beaches 
came 
from 
that 

weather, 
the 
energy, 
that 

laidback vibe,” he said in a phone 
interview earlier this week. “I 
really wanted to carry that over 
and add deeper meaning to my 
project — I didn’t want just a 
bunch of songs. I wanted a story: 
highs, lows, chill, upbeat songs.”

Friday’s 
showcase 
wasn’t 

Hachem and Schechter’s first 
time 
collaborating 
in 
the 

production of a live show; while 
Schechter interned at the Pig, 
he helped Munch gain exposure 
by getting him to open for 
Futuristic this past April.

“(Prior to last Friday’s show), 

Munch was really persistent 
about doing a big thing at a 
local venue, so I gave him the 
opportunity, and he did a great 
job,” Schechter said. “It was like 
a family reunion for Munch. He 
brought out his whole family, 
kind of seemed like a wedding 
at one point. I loved his energy; 
it was a good vibe.”

Munch’s 
tenacity 
toward 

exposure is also present in 
his artistry. In developing his 
upcoming eight-track album, 
expected out before the year’s 
end, Munch approached the 
project from a place of honesty, 
looking for his true self to come 
through in the music. In terms 
of Friday’s show, the “family 
reunion” 
vibe 
Schechter 

touched on was a direct result 
of Munch’s efforts to push 
the boundaries of his own 
marketing, seeing how many 
people he could get out to the 
show.

“(The turnout) was more 

than I was expecting,” Hachem 
said. “I didn’t go in with any 
crazy 
expectations. 
It 
was 

really amazing to have people 
who honestly support you. No 
one had to do that.”

“No 
one” 
encompasses 

not just fans who came out 
to the showcase to see local 
hip hop, but also Schechter. 
The 
admiration 
Schechter 

exudes toward the artists and 
bands he is passionate about is 
reciprocated by gratitude; both 
Castor and Munch had nothing 
but praise when it came to 
Schechter’s involvement in the 
showcase.

“He’s the biggest homie Ann 

Arbor has to offer,” Munch said. 
“The guy is creating amazing 
opportunities for local artists, 
committing 
his 
time 
and 

efforts to give them a chance 
to shine in the community. He’s 
so professional and appreciates 
the artists. And that’s the best 
part of working with What The 
Sound: he shows respect to 
everyone.”

On 
What 
The 
Sound’s 

promotional breadth, Castor 
praised the emphasis on a 
University-centric show: “They 

really came after the college 
crowd better than a typical 
hip-hop promoter would for 
an Ann Arbor show. Including 
University students on the bill 
such as Munch, Broccoli and 
Dude Madison so they can 
invite their friends and going 
after that college base is a 
smart move.”

Schechter has ambitions to 

push What The Sound beyond 
the city of Ann Arbor. After 
graduating in December, he 
hopes to find a job that allows 
him to continue What The 
Sound on the side. Interviewing 
more artists (when he has 
the time to transcribe) and 
continuing to promote shows 
locally 
while 
also 
looking 

to expand to other markets 
are key pillars of Schechter’s 
vision. 
Specifically, 
What 

The Sound is in the process of 
setting up a second Chicago 
showcase as well as one in 
Bloomington, Indiana, home of 
Indiana University.

The showcases go through 

a plethora of iterations before 
Schechter lands on the final 
version of a lineup. Two months 
before a show, he locks in the 
date with the venue and about 
half a month later, promotion 
begins. Moving beyond posters 
on campus, What The Sound’s 
third showcase of the semester 
will have a Snapchat geofilter 
Friday night.

“I feel like I learned a lot 

while interning for the Pig: 
which shows do well, which 
don’t and how to build a good 
lineup,” he said. “The last four 
years of learning about the 
music scene in Ann Arbor, the 
past artists who have played 
here and the artists currently 
becoming musicians here have 
taught how to formulate a good 
bill.”

As he did last Friday, before 

Munch performed, Schechter 
will 
walk 
onto 
the 
Blind 

Pig 
stage 
tomorrow 
night 

to introduce another What 
The Sound headliner. This 
week, that’s The Stellars, a 
two-person indie-rock band 
which will also consist of eight 
live band members for the 
showcase.

“I really enjoy saying this 

was my idea from the start; 
these are the bands I chose, 
and next thing you know there 
are 250 people at the show,” 
Schechter said. “Knowing that 
I’m the one who organized, 
promoted and advertised the 
show, it’s really rewarding to 
see the show happening, really 
great music being played and 
people really into it. A lot of 
people know that I do this, and 
they say it’s really cool, and I’m 
so appreciative of that, but to 
actually see the night go well 
and know that I put it together 
is really rewarding.”

Girl and the Goat: The toughest 

reservation in Chi-town

FOOD COLUMN

This 
summer, 
a 
friend 

managed to snag us a hot 
Monday evening rez at Chicago’s 
famed Girl and the Goat. “Top 
Chef” winner and University 
of Michigan alum Stephanie 
Izard opened up the lively spot 
in Chicago’s West Loop in 2010, 
and reservations there have 
been near-impossible to come 
by ever since. So when my 
friend offered up a chance to 
finally try out one of Chicago’s 
most talked about dining spots, 
I couldn’t pass it up.

At 5:45 on a weekday, the 

place was still packed. The 
rustic interior buzzed with the 
energy of diners eager to try 
Izard’s acclaimed dishes. This 
energy felt palpable as soon as 
we walked in and were warmly 
greeted by the hostess. She led 
us to a counter spot for two that 
was practically located inside 
the bustling open kitchen. 
While flustered at first by 
this oddly isolated yet invasive 
seating arrangement, we were 
compelled by our proximity 
to the flurry of kitchen staff 
gracefully plating an array of 
tasty-looking dishes. Though 
the spot placed us in the heart 
of the restaurant’s activity, it 
still felt cozy enough for an 
elevated dining experience. And 
I was especially grateful later 
when faced with the challenge 
of choosing from the wide 
selection of unconventionally 
appealing menu items. I was 
overwhelmed to the point of 
a near panic attack when our 
server showed up to take our 
order, until I glanced over 
and my attention was caught 
by a plate of hamachi crudo 
beckoning me to try it.

Luckily, the restaurant serves 

up small plates with big flavor, 
so my friend and I selected four. 
Unlike traditional menus, the 
categories were divided into 

vegetarian, fish, poultry and, of 
course, goat dishes. Rather than 
focus on size, plates are offered 
according to content and flavor 
— allowing guests to build a 
customized meal with diverse 
options.

One of the must-try options 

are the freshly baked breads. 
We started with the olive bread 
and were promptly served a 
warm, crusty loaf studded with 
green olives and accompanied 
by a tangy whipped feta spread 
and dish of garlicky olive oil 
to dip the bread in. Not only is 
the bread just plain good, the 
cognizant act of selecting it 
from among four different bread 
options speaks to the careful 
intent with which the menu 
is crafted. Izard deliberately 
pairs ingredients and presents 
them to us to consume wholly 
and consciously. No food item or 
ingredient is used imprudently 
— as should be the case. And 
even the bread is no exception. 

Now 
that 
I’ve 
spent 
a 

paragraph just discussing the 
bread, I’ll move on to the bulk 
of our meal, which included 
the hamachi crudo and roasted 
cauliflower. The cauliflower 
was roasted to perfection and 
paired nicely with crunchy pine 
nuts and pickled peppers. I’m a 
huge fan of mint, and though 
I’ve never thought to serve it 
with a roasted vegetable, I was 
pleasantly surprised at the pop 
of flavor in each bite.

This unexpectedness is one 

of the primary elements that 
draws praise from customers 

and 
critics 
alike. 
Izard’s 

ingenuity when it comes to 
combining flavors we aren’t used 
to trying together rejuvenates 
the dining experience by adding 
an element of surprise and 
subsequent pleasure. The tart 
caperberries and salty, crisp 
pork belly of the hamachi crudo 
were balanced by the neutral 
flavor and velvety texture of 
thinly sliced raw fish. Both 
the fish and pork belly, while 
seemingly rich, indulged our 
appetite with a delicate ease 
that exemplifies the culinary 
craft at its finest.

Without overwhelming our 

palates, Izard deftly transforms 
a variety of ingredients and 
flavors that please us because 
we’re 
so 
unaccustomed 
to 

enjoying them together. Her 
restaurant 
provides 
a 
safe 

space for us to explore our 
epicurean curiosities. And the 
results don’t disappoint. It’s no 
wonder that Girl and the Goat 
started out as successfully as 
it did and that it has retained 
its mass appeal since. While I 
rarely allow myself to buy into 
the hype of such places, Girl 
and the Goat’s buzz is well-
deserved.

Girl and the Goat is a true 

testament to what relentless 
hard work from a chef like 
Izard and a bold perspective 
can infuse into the dining 
experience and into the food 
industry. Even my practiced 
indifference, in the face of 
expectations built up to a 
near impossible standard of 
being met, was shattered with 
the first bite I took of Izard’s 
famed food. Though ordinary 
is far from what you get when 
you dine at Girl and the Goat, 
you’ll be easily transported 
into a world where even the 
most inconceivable dishes are 
presented and devoured with 
the utmost normality. Which 
is why, six years after the 
restaurant’s opening, I’m here 
singing its praise.

At 5:45 on a 
weekday, the 
place was still 

packed.


Situated comfortably among 

the name-brand shops that line 
the streets of downtown Ann 
Arbor lies a cafe that prides 
itself on originality. There are 
no chains in foreign cities nor 
a neon sign that electrifies 
the door — only a reputation 
that whispers across campus 
and city streets alike. With 
the lightest of touches, the 
country screen doors open into 
a coffeehouse like no other, 
as well as a place where the 
mainstream is turned away 
faster 
than 
decaffeinated 

coffee. 

At 
least, 
this 
was 
the 

establishment 
John 
Roos 

might have envisioned while 
he 
brewed 
his 
signature 

coffee from a job at a local 
car 
dealership. 
And 
when 

customers eventually started 
coming 
around 
for 
their 

daily caffeinated fix, the idea 
behind RoosRoast Coffee was 
birthed. Since its conception, 
RoosRoast has been operating 
on Rosewood Street, where 
they continue to brew their 
own coffee made with beans 
purchased direct from the 
origin.

However, this past March, 

the company took over a 
spot on East Liberty Street 
in downtown Ann Arbor and 
became a sort of successor 
to Elixir Vitae. With closer 
ties to downtown and the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

campus, RoosRoast has been 
the talk of the semester among 
coffee fanatics and caffeine 
addicts alike, and the company 
has enjoyed their newfound 
popularity under the stress of 
a city that never sleeps.

To 
learn 
more 
about 

the 
newly 
opened 
second 

establishment, The Michigan 
Daily spent a sunny Monday 
afternoon on a coffee date 
with 
Katherine 
Weider-

Roos, co-owner and wife to 
RoosRoast founder John Roos.

The philosophy at RoosRoast 

is simple — to brew the perfect 
cup of coffee. Whether through 
AeroPress, steeping, cold brew 
or a rigged nitro experiment, 
Roos is always looking for 
the perfect balance of natural 
flavors 
against 
caffeine 

intensity.

“People treat coffee a little 

bit 
different,” 
Weider-Roos 

said. “If you’re doing a lighter 
roast, it’s just a taste thing. 
You’re sipping it a little more 
like wine — it’s a little bit 
lighter. Especially if you have 
a really good quality cup (of) 
coffee.” This partially explains 
the reason their loud and busy 
cafe is set up in the style of a 
bar, sporting high-tops over 
quaint little tables. 

“You want to roast a coffee 

just the right amount so you 
don’t blow out all the notes. 
That’s why when we get single 
origins in, we usually have a 
more medium light treatment 
to it. It’s a delicate dance to do 
those delicate roasts right so 
they all don’t taste the same.”

As far as similar tastes go, 

RoosRoast 
has 
more 
than 

outdone themselves. With a 
selection of coffees and teas 
that range from the dark, 
electrifying 
“Portland 
in 

the ’90s” to the organically 
supplied 
“Spicy 
Ginger 

Lemon” tea, the cafe caters to 
all tastes and preferences. The 
detail that goes into catering 
to needs of their customers is 

down to a fine point, brewing 
their drinks organically and 
allowing patrons to customize 
their drinking experience to 
their own taste.

“We have a big thing about 

not making sweetened drinks, 
letting people add their honey 
or their sweetener. But when 
you go around to all the cafes, 
everything is sweetened — 
they 
hand 
you 
something 

sweetened,” Weider-Roos said. 
“We wanted to have something 
(where people) can add their 
(own) level of sweetness.”

This includes their one-of-

a-kind “AeroPress Bar,” which 
brews their specialty coffee 
faster than most other large-
yield means and in a way that 
really lets you taste all of the 
natural flavor that’s made their 
name in the coffee business.

“You can try any of our 

coffees with the AeroPress 
… and it just brews a more 
complex, rich cup of coffee 
than a drip would. It allows 
you to really taste our coffee.” 
Of course, their AeroPress is 
second only to the excellent 
cold brew that is produced 
by the gallon on a day-to-day 
basis at RoosRoast.

Over the past few years, 

cold-brew coffee has worked 
its way up into the hierarchy 
of 
caffeinated 
beverages, 

overtaking 
iced 
coffee 
in 

a debate that has sparked 
mixed opinions on both sides. 
Critically 
acclaimed 
and 

favored 
for 
its 
wholesome 

flavor and smooth finish, the 
cold brew is rapidly gaining 
popularity in cafes worldwide. 
However, since the process of 
steeping a cold brew can take 
up to 24 hours, iced coffee 
is often served as a quick 
alternative. 
Hailed 
for 
its 

strength and caffeine-to-water 
ratio, RoosRoast produces cold 
brew daily, and never seems to 
run out of the stuff that keeps 
us running.

“It’s 
like 
a 
concentrate, 

RoosRoast sets up shop 
in downtown Ann Arbor

MEGAN MITCHELL

Cozy new coffee shop delivers locally made beans, brews

so it’s meant to withhold the 
melting of the ice so you still 
have something drinkable after 
the ice melts. So it’s a really 
good cold brew,” Weider-Roos 
said with a smile, citing the 
numerous comments that their 
Instagram page has received 
regarding the sheer caffeinated 
strength of their cold brew.

“The cold brew kind of jacks 

you up. The whole process is an 
immersion … it never touches 
hot water. You let it soak in the 
water for almost 24 hours — 
cold water — so it never touches 
hot water. It cools out all the 
caffeine in this totally different 
way. It’s kind of like a drug.”

The opportunity to sample 

their brew only further proved 
that the rumors are, in fact, true 
— it’s strong as hell.

The experience of drinking 

the one-of-a-kind coffee and 
specialty 
drinks 
served 
at 

RoosRoast’s newest location is 
certainly memorable. With loud 
Cuban jazz playing through 
the speakers and the amicable 
barista-to-patron interactions, 
it’s easy to get lost in the good 
ambiance. 
And 
though 
the 

storefront has changed in the 
gutting 
process, 
what 
once 

stood as the second location of 
the Elixir Vitae coffeehouse on 
East Liberty is now RoosRoast. 
However, 
patrons 
of 
the 

previous venue would be remiss 
if they didn’t recognize the 
flavor.

“This was (Elixir Vitae’s) 

second location — he served 
RoosRoast,” Weider-Roos said. 

The rumor circulating around 

the 
coffee-addicted 
forums 

of Ann Arbor that RoosRoast 
supplied Elixir Vitae with their 
roasts is, in fact, true. So when 
the owner of Elixir gave up their 
second location, patrons were 
thrown for a little bit of a shock. 

“This was becoming too much 

for him to manage (the two 
places) I think,” Weider-Roos 
said. “So he wanted to get out of 

his lease … I think it was a great 
gift. Like saying, ‘Hey I want 
you guys to take over my lease, 
what do you think?’ So it was 
more sort of handing it to us, in 
a way.” 

It was, in a way, like choosing 

RoosRoast as the successor to 
Elixir; passing on the torch to a 
new generation of roasting and 
opening the door to the third 
wave coffee movement. “He 
was serving RoosRoast and that 
way (the people) can still get 
RoosRoast,” Weider-Roos said.

So far, business has been 

booming at the second location 
of 
RoosRoast, 
which 
is 

conveniently closer to campus 
and thus more readily accessible 
to students than their base 
location.

“It’s like your whole world 

changes, 
because 
of 
the 

complexity of it … almost like 
being in newborn crisis mode,” 
Weider-Roos said. “The vibes, 
the people and the demand for 
it — it’s like having a party. It’s 
so fun to be down here. It gives 
us exposure here to people 
who aren’t able to go out to 
Rosewood.”

Being this close to campus, 

coffee shops are often utilized as 
a fresh study space for students 
who need a caffeine fix to stay 
up that extra three or four hours 
to finish an assignment. So with 
its high stools and standing 
room only, RoosRoast carries 
the ambiance more of a grab-
and-go shop versus a hot study 
space.

“We wanted to be more like 

a neighborhood bar, it’s about 
having a meeting and talking. 
Stand and go … it’s not like a 
quiet little library. It’s like a 
moving thing: we’re going to 
be shouting, we’re going to 
be doing things. It’s kind of 
like a place — a social, vibrant 
community place rather than a 
library place.”

With a smile, Weider-Roos 

described their newest location 

as “a little bit like performance, 
crazy (and) social. It’s not like 
this all the time, but we’re just 
loud people and we also like to 
have a good time while we’re 
working. It’s like a neighborhood 
bar, but with coffee. Where 
people are getting jacked up, not 
drunk.”

Another feature of RoosRoast 

is commonly shared by cafes 
worldwide: food. Not just any 
food, but a specific brand of food 
that leans towards organic and 
healthy, kept across the move 
from Elixir Vitae.

“We wanted an element of 

light food. Not a full-service 
kitchen but something with 
your 
coffee: 
small 
bites.” 

Weider-Roos said. “You go to a 
lot of cafes and it’s just sugar, 
white flour — we have that too 
(laughs). But we also have other 
options: protein and things we 
would eat at home.”

So, even if you’re not in for 

an 
early-morning 
cramming 

session, RoosRoast is still an 
available stop to come in to get 
your most important meal of 
the day with some of the best 
coffee and service this side of 
Michigan.

Of course, we saved our most 

important question for last: “If 
you could have one item off of 
the entire menu, what would it 
be?” 

“Personally, we have to have 

espresso,” Weider-Roos said. 

“Our 
espresso 
blend 
is 

amazing right now. That’s a 
personal (choice). I would have 
to say, from a consumer point of 
view, I would be outvoted and it 
would be Lobster Butter Love. 
Maybe it has crack cocaine in 
it? It’s a bit of a cult; like, it’s 
50 percent of our sales. I send 
it to Portland, Ore. You’d think 
they’d have good coffee in those 
places, but I ship Lobster Butter 
Love there.”

If 
it’s 
good 
enough 
for 

Portland, it’s good enough for 
us.

 As if being bodied by Drake 
wasn’t enough for the man, 
Meek Mill finds himself in the 
midst of yet another one-sided 
beef, this time being served 
rapacious, insulting bars by 
L.A. rapper The Game. This 
comes after The Game accused 
Meek Mill of telling the police 
that The Game was involved 
in the theft of Sean Kingston’s 
jewelry. It’s a messy, dramatic 
and somewhat childish feud, 
but the material coming out of 
it all has been providing the 
rap zeitgeist plenty of fodder 
to feed on — and The Game’s 
latest escalation is no excep-
tion.
 “Pest Control” itself con-
tains verses targeting a variety 
of individuals besides Meek. 
On Beanie Sigel, a Philadelphia 
MC who hopped on Meek’s 
only diss track in the feud thus 
far, The Game harshly bellows 

“Take Beans 
back to 
rehab / On 
Instagram 
looking like 
a moth-
erfucking 
bean bag” — 
but he saves 
most of his 
airtime 
stringing 
together 
whatever 
insults he 
can to convey his superior-
ity over Meek. He raps “You 
jumped Quentin Miller and 
now you don’t scrap / It was 
time to go at Drizzy and now 
you don’t rap” in reference 
to his laughable “beef” with 
Drake; he cites that “This 
n***a taking Ls every time 
he go viral” and “Keep it 100, 
you a Nicki Minaj sideshow.” 
He spits fire and harsh truth 
alike, fostering Meek’s contin-
ued fall from grace. It isn’t a 
feud with much explanation or 
rationale, but out of it all, The 
Game is able to flex his bread 

and butter by verbally body-
ing those who cross him with 
finesse and mastery.
 There’s probably more to 
come out of this beef, but as 
time goes on, the spotlight 
shines brighter and brighter 
on The Game and his crew. 
“Pest Control” is one of many 
examples of The Game’s abil-
ity to convey his worth to the 
rap game, and if Meek con-
tinues to prolong this feud, it 
won’t be long until he’s fin-
ished digging his career’s own 
grave.

crack cocaine in

cult.”


With 
unruly 
gray 
hair, 

glasses and a short beard, it’s 
not hard to imagine Peter 
Kornbluh as he was in the Ann 
Arbor of his youth: picketing the 
Iran-Contra deal on the Diag, 
engaging in political debates 
with his Chilean girlfriend 
and her family — and writing, 
always writing.

Since leaving for college out 

east, Kornbluh has accumulated 
an impressive track record: 
he has published a handful of 
books, declassified thousands 
of intelligence files, met Fidel 
Castro and been on “Charlie 
Rose.”

But 
most 
recently, 

Kornbluh has been dealing 
with 
heightened 
fame. 
His 

latest book, “Back Channel 
to Cuba: The Hidden History 
of 
Negotiations 
Between 

Washington and Havana,” has 
proven popular. Along with 
co-author William LeoGrande, 
Kornbluh published the book 
shortly 
before 
President 

Obama announced his historic 
agreement 
with 
Cuba 
in 

December 2014.

“Most of the negotiations 

were quite secret, and that is 
why they never really became 
part of the public discussion 
over Cuba policy,” Kornbluh 
said. “In the end [President 
Obama] understood that the 
Cubans were not going to make 
concessions. So far, his strategy 
is working.”

“Back Channel” soon hit 

bestseller lists due to its relevant 
subject matter and surprising 
clairvoyance. After all, when 
Kornbluh wrote it, its story 
had no resolution — the United 
States and Cuba have been 
negotiating for a normalization 
of relations since Castro took 
power 
in 
1959. 
President 

Obama’s 
announcement 
and 

subsequent visit seemed like the 
fulfillment of a prophecy, the 
culmination of all the hidden 
political efforts Kornbluh and 
LeoGrande had revealed in 
their book.

Kornbluh returned to Ann 

Arbor last week amid this 
flurry of attention to speak to a 
full house at Literati, sign some 
books and go home — back to 
DC, that is. That didn’t keep it 
from turning into a sentimental 
hometown visit anyway.

He may be a Washington 

man now, with Latin America 
on speed dial, but you’d never 
guess it as Kornbluh sipped 
his espresso on the top floor of 
Literati. The only Washington 
outside these doors is the busy 
downtown street, and everyone 
stepping off that street and 
into the store seemed to know 
Kornbluh intimately. Remnants 
of his time here, old neighbors, 
colleagues and friends, come 
in one after another as I sit 
observing.

Friends of his mother — small, 

kind women in their nineties 
— gave Kornbluh bear hugs as 
he marveled that they went up 
that steep flight of stairs just 
to see him. History Prof. Jesse 
Hoffnung-Garskof, interviewer 

for the night, showed up in a 
crisp red guayabera his father 
got in Cuba in the 1970s. Even 
Kornbluh’s former mother-in-
law, the tiny Chilean madre of 
that girlfriend (now ex-wife) 
from all those years ago in Ann 
Arbor, came up to wish him 
well. She greeted him warmly, 
first 
with 
Spanish 
terms 

of endearment and then in 
affectionate, accented English.

“Oh, 
hello, 
Professor 

Langland, 
how 
are 
you?” 

Everyone got their espresso, 
cheerfully ignoring the setting 
sun outside the window, and 
took their seats. These were 
Latin Americans, after all — the 
coffee flows like water.

Kornbluh has plenty of tales 

to tell, and he’s happy to share 
them if only you ask. Now and 
then, the stories jumped out 
of casual conversation already 
clothed in technicolor and three 
dimensions: Henry Kissinger 
slams 
his 
office 
door 
and 

grumbles, “That pipsqueak!” 
at Fidel, the insolent punk 
leering at him across the Straits 
of 
Florida. 
Gabriel 
Garcia 

Márquez sits at a long wooden 
table in Cape Cod, the famous 
novelist acting as undercover 
link between Washington and 
Cuba. A bull-headed Cuban 
exile 
flies 
his 
two-engine 

into Cuban airspace, drifting 
closer and closer to Havana 
and sparking an international 
incident.

“I just hope the color of [these 

events] is transmitted through 
the book,” Kornbluh said.

(It is.)
At the core of his work, 

though, is not swashbuckling 
adventure 
but 
meticulous 

research, 
compellingly 
told. 

Kornbluh does more than just 
declassify, read and report. He 
has sifted through stacks, piles, 
libraries full of documents, 
somehow crafting a cohesive 
narrative out of the fragmented, 
often 
contradictory 
mosaic 

of U.S. intelligence efforts in 

Latin America. He sussed this 
information 
out 
of 
willing 

subjects, many of them former 
intelligence 
officers 
and 

government officials frustrated 
with the way things went all 
those years ago.

“The best source is the one 

with the grievance,” he said. 
He calls his technique “critical 
oral 
history” 
— 
declassify 

the documents, take them to 
the person who wrote them, 
received them or carried out 
their orders and ask them why 
they did what they did. “It’s an 
amazing feeling to meet these 
people,” he said.

He’s been doing this since 

college, when an article in 
“Penthouse” (he says he only 
read it for the articles) led 
him to the former Ambassador 
to 
Chile 
under 
the 
Nixon 

Administration. Weeks later, he 
was sitting in the man’s living 
room, listening to him read 
sheaths of top secret documents 
into Kornbluh’s tape recorder. 
The tape ran out after an hour, 
but let’s call it a victory.

The 
key 
to 
his 
major 

professional 
findings 
on 

Chile 
and 
Cuba 
is 
the 

National Security Archive, an 
organization with an ominous-
sounding name that’s actually 
a benign, inquisitive nonprofit.

“It’s an organization that 

tries to use history to make 
history. The goal is to release 
documents that can enhance 
our knowledge of history and 
provide 
closure,” 
Kornbluh 

said. 
“The 
declassified 

documents allow one to be a 
fly on the wall as U.S. officials 
from Kennedy to Kissinger to 
Oliver North discuss using U.S. 
aggression and influence, overt 
and covert, to assert control 
over the region.”

As Havana real estate prices 

rise and Americans clamor for 
Jet Blue tickets direct to Cuba, 
no one is quite sure what comes 
next. What’s certain, though, is 
that Kornbluh will be returning 
to the island, and so will his 
book.

“I spent considerable time 

arranging for the book to 
be printed also in Cuba,” he 
explained, “for a price that 
Cubans can afford.”

The Cuban edition comes 

out in December, while the 
snows batter Ann Arbor and 
Washington, and the sun beats 
down in Havana.

 Last week, Radiohead 
debuted their third video 
from A Moon Shaped Pool, this 
time for the song “Present 
Tense.” A sparse production, 
it features members Thom 
Yorke and Jonny Greenwood 
accompanied by a Roland 
CR-78, with Paul Thomas 
Anderson behind the camera 
as director. Yorke and crew 
previously worked with 
Anderson on “Daydreaming,” 
AMSP’s second video, which 
premiered back in August.
 But “Present Tense” is barely 
a music video. And Anderson’s 
presence is barely felt, with 

only hints of 
his creative 
hand 
appearing as 
the camera 
cuts between 
close ups of 
Yorke’s face 
and wider 
shots of 
Greenwood 
and Yorke 
performing 
together. 
Otherwise, 
the video serves more as a 
live performance. It’s dimly 
lit and intimate, as if you 
were watching it at the Blind 
Pig, rather than on YouTube. 
And if I’m being honest, this 
is the first Radiohead music 
video I’ve ever seen. I’d 
never really felt the need to 

give their music any visual 
representation; it’s already so 
hauntingly satisfying when it 
stands alone. But I have seen 
the band live, and this video 
feels a lot like that — except, 
lucky for you, it’s not as 
crowded.

Most recently, 
Kornbluh has 

been dealing with 
heightened fame.

For a few cold days in early 

1960, a group of documentari-
ans led by Robert Drew followed 
two presidential candidates as 
they campaigned against each 
other in the Wisconsin demo-
cratic primary. One candidate 
connected with the low-income 
white rural voter, one with the 
more diverse, upper-income cit-
ies. One candidate was a natural 
with large crowds; one worked 
better in intimate conversations 
with voters. One candidate had 
detailed policy proposals, one 
relied on sweeping rhetoric.

Sound familiar? This wasn’t 

Clinton and Trump or Clin-
ton and Sanders. It was John F. 
Kennedy of Massachusetts and 
Hubert Humphrey of Minne-
sota. The showdown between 
the two senators, captured in 
Robert Drew’s 1960 documen-
tary, “Primary,” is as civil as 
this election is uncivil, yet the 
demographic and representative 
divisions remain unchanged. 
As Election Day draws nearer, 
Humphrey continues to speak to 
people in their homes and on the 
street, while Kennedy attracts 
large crowds for speeches in cit-
ies. Humphrey rails against the 
newspapers and magazines that 
“laugh at the farmers.” Kennedy 
remains silent about his Catho-
lic faith until he appears in 
heavily Polish Catholic Milwau-
kee. Both fidget ever so slightly 
when they speak.

33 years later, another rising 

Democratic star received the 
documentary treatment, but the 
form and focus was completely 
different. “The War Room” fol-
lowed Bill Clinton’s campaign 
from the primaries to the gen-
eral election. Clinton, who was 
plagued by scandal even during 
the primaries, was an icon for 
a new generation in American 
politics. He and Al Gore, his 
Tennessean running mate, were 
both Southern Democrats who 
had tapped into the economic 
anxieties of their surroundings. 
“New Democrats” found a hero 

in the Arkansan Clinton. Mean-
while, to Clinton and his sup-
porters, George H.W. Bush, the 
sitting president, was a wealthy 
old fogey who had feigned soli-
darity for the working class on 
the campaign trail by promising 
to never raise taxes, only to do so 
once in office.

The story of “The War Room” 

isn’t about Clinton and Bush, 
though. It’s about Clinton’s two 
chief operatives who have since 
become major stars in the politi-
cal world. James “The Ragin’ 
Cajun” Carville, Clinton’s cam-
paign manager, is a rambunc-
tious visionary whose skills 
are matched in strength only 
by his Bayou accent. George 
Stephanopoulos, whose fame 
has grown since he began host-
ing ABC News’s Sunday show, 
was Clinton’s young and prep-
py communications director. 
Carville and Stephanopoulos, 
at first glance, are more suit-
able for a buddy comedy than 
a national campaign, but their 
adept political skills become 
apparent quickly.

Political media has trans-

formed, thanks to cable televi-
sion and, recently, the Internet, 
from basic reports of candidate 
positions in 1960 to fully-fledged 
war-zone 
correspondence 
in 

1992 to the present. One of the 
casualties of the 24/7 news cycle 
is brilliantly displayed by the 
entirety of Pennebaker’s docu-
mentary. While “Primary” fol-
lows two candidates, “The War 
Room” follows two campaign 
operatives. Bill Clinton barely 
appears in person; he’s often 
reserved to the small televi-
sion screen in the corner of the 
campaign office. But that’s pre-
cisely the point: in the postmod-
ern political era, candidates for 
elected office are merely pixels 
on a screen — television, com-
puter, phone or otherwise. Can-
didates are defined not by what 
is truly newsworthy (namely, 
their policy positions), but rath-
er on what brings in the most 
traffic (namely, their scandals, 
one of which, Jennifer Flowers, 
appears in “The War Room”). 
And rarely do those two overlap.

It’s appropriate, then, that 

there’s a narrator in “Primary” 
who enters the conversation 
periodically, 
detailing 
what 

each candidate is doing, what 
their strengths are and what’s 
on the agenda next. Akin to a 
reliable 1960 news media, raw 
material is contextualized and 
synthesized for the average 
viewer, though the audience for 
“Primary” was likely limited 
to those who closely followed 
politics. No documentary is 
entirely objective, but “Prima-
ry” is pretty close. There is no 
narrator in “The War Room” — 
with constant access to politics, 
we no longer need a distiller of 
information — but all informa-
tion comes from one side of 
the debate. Jennifer Flowers is 
something to be downplayed. 
“No New Taxes” is something to 
be given attention. 

There’s another story to be 

told: both films are equally 
about political messaging, but 
each clearly belongs to its own 
generation of the practice. Ken-
nedy and Humphrey have dif-
ferent messages and express 
them 
differently 
but 
each 

appears genuine. To the skep-
tical viewer, meanwhile, Bill 
Clinton, still pixelated on the 
corner television, is rendered a 
vessel for his operatives’ strat-
egies. The opponent, the estab-
lishment incumbent Bush, must 
have been equally, if not more, 
shaped by hired consultants 
than personal convictions.

“The War Room” asks and 

answers the question: has new 
political media helped us? Prob-
ably not. We still know pre-
cious little about candidates’ 
policy positions or about the 
issues over which they dis-
agree. Instead, endless ink is 
spilled on the horse race, the 
peripheral consultant class that 
shapes each candidate (though, 
arguably, that is becoming just 
as valuable) and the tangential 
scandals that reflect little to 
nothing about governing abil-
ity. To paraphrase one current 
presidential candidate, it’s time 
to make political media great 
again.

Old docs show new campaign tricks

‘The War Room’ and ‘Primary’ show how political media operates

I am twelve years old, and my 

mother, grandmother and I are 
traveling to the northern part of 
Iran. From my grandmother’s 
home in Tehran, we road trip for 
almost eight hours via one giant 
bus filled with people from all 
around the city. In early morning 
darkness and almost complete 
silence, we board the bus. The 
engine rumbles to life, and we 
depart. For the first 20 minutes, 
while the deep indigo of the sky 
slowly filters to grey, to orange, 
to sunrise, the inhabitants of the 
bus keep mostly to themselves. 
I am more than ready to spend 
this trip how I would normally 
spend an American bus ride to 
school: in complete, reserved 
silence. Our bus driver, however, 
has different plans. 

As soon as the first rays of 

sunlight reach through the fin-
gerprint-smudged glass of the 
windows, he decides he is tired 
of the inhibitions of his passen-
gers and flicks on the radio. Out 
blares loud Persian music, more 
appropriate for a late-night club 
scene than a dirty bus at 7 in the 
morning. I am sleep deprived, 
deeply confused and, most of 
all, desperately trying to keep 
out of the spotlight. So instead 
of trying to take apart the deep 
complexities of this strange situ-
ation, I burrow my head onto my 
grandmother’s shoulder, close 
my eyes and try to nap away the 
remainder of the trip.

When I awake groggily a few 

hours later, I seem to be in an 
entirely different world. What 
had been a relatively discreet bus 
when I had fallen asleep (despite 

the ostentatious music) is now 
a full-fledged dance party: peo-
ple dancing in the aisle, people 
dancing on top of the bus seats, 
their hands and arms and heads 
hanging out of the window 
while cheers, whoops and hol-
lers collide in the air. In the time 
I blissfully slept, strangers have 
become friends, sharing ther-
moses of tea and biscuits. In the 
time I blissfully slept, strang-
ers had become dance partners, 
shimmying up and down the 
narrow aisle to the encourage-
ment of the other passengers. 
Old, young, man, woman, it 
didn’t matter — if you were on 
that bus, you were aggressively 
pulled into the chaos. By the 
time the bus pulled into its des-
tination many hours later, I had 
learned two things. One: there 
is hardly anything more valued 
and preserved in Persian cul-
ture than music. It is such an 
essential aspect to the Persian 
identity that it often feels like 
the unifying bond that ties the 
entire culture together.

Two: there really ain’t no 

party like a Persian party.

In fact, my earliest memory of 

the Persian culture that my par-
ents tried to preserve even when 
they immigrated to the United 
States was music. I vaguely 
remember my mother picking 
me up and twirling me around 
our small kitchen to the viva-
cious beat of different Persian 
songs while my father cheered 
from the sidelines. Whenever 
we would visit family in Iran, 
house parties would never fail to 
pop up almost every day of the 
week, all set to a soundtrack that 
was both modern and inherently 
Persian.

In part, the reason why music 

holds such an importance in 
Persian culture is because lan-
guage holds such precedence 
in identity. From famous poets 
like Rumi to famous singers 
like Googoosh, all Iranian art-
ists handle their words like the 
language is an art itself. Tra-
ditional Persian songs are, in 
essence, poems layered over a 
simple instrumental tune; their 
purpose is not to entertain, but 
to tell a story. Even more modern 
dance jams still take inspiration 
from the iconic old songs, remix-
ing conventional melodies and 
adding more appropriate heavy 
club beats. But as Persian music 
grows and evolves, it never seems 
to lose sight of its origins, and 
neither have the Persian people.

When I was little, Persian 

music was all that I listened to, 
mostly because it was all my par-
ents would play in the house. But 
it was also because I felt a certain 
connection to the songs, even 
back then, when I didn’t know yet 
of the importance of music in my 
culture. Even now that my music 
taste has expanded and varied 
quite a bit, whenever I go back 
to the Persian classics I remem-
ber my parents playing, I gain a 
certain sense of sweet nostalgia. 
It makes me feel connected to 
an identity that I sometimes feel 
very disconnected from. No mat-
ter what is happening in my life 
here, I listen to this music and I 
remember there is a country, a 
city, a place where the people, my 
people, are as vibrant and beauti-
ful as the songs I hear through 
my headphones. I remember 
this and never fail to feel a little 
less alone.
