The smoke is beginning to
clear.
Afterbeingdeferred twice, the
Ann Arbor City Council passed
the first reading of an ordinance
that would prohibit smoking in
certain parts of the city.
The ordinance received eight
votes. Only Councilmembers
Jane Lumm (I-Ward 2), Sumi,
Kailasapathy (D-Ward 1) and
Jack Eaton (D-Ward 4) voted
against the ordinance.
The ordinance would prohibit
citizens from smoking within
20 feet of any bus stop or city
building as well as within certain
areas of specific city parks.
While the official penalty for
violating the ordinance is $50,
the new legislation would ensure
that offenders must first be asked
to extinguish anyoutlawed prod-
uct before receiving a citation.
Another pressing issue with

that only police otticers can write
citations and give warnings,
whereas the ordinance previous-
ly stated that any city employee
reserved such power.
Further, the bill's sponsors
Warpehoski and Christopher
Taylor (D-Ward 3) also allowed
an amendment by Councilmem-
ber Sabra Briere (D-Ward 1) that
added e-cigarettes to the list of
banned smoking products explic-
itly laid out in the ordinance.
Councilmember StephenKun-
selman (D-Ward 3) expressed
concerns about the lack of focus
on preventing smoke from wood
burning as well, and added that
smokers having the ability to
walk down the sidewalk while
smoking near buildings would be
cause for worry.
He added that he does not
believe there should be a fine for
violating the ordinance since the
ordinance will be "self-regulat-
ing." He instead asked council to
eliminate the fine and revisit the

New products
bring caffeine
to baked goods

University alum's
start-up expands
to campus cafes
By HILLARY CRAWFORD
Daily StaffReporter
Getting that caffeine fix has
become tastier and more con-
venient than ever before - no
coffee required.
For lack of a better alterna-
tive in the local market, Univer-
sity alum Chris Bogdan decided
to combine his favorite break-
fast items into one product,
called Get Up and Go. While it
is not necessarily uncommon
for bakeries to add espresso to
their offerings for taste, it is
rare that they do it to pack the
punch of a cup of coffee.
Bogdan said he used his Cel-
lular and Molecular Biology
major to combine the amount
of caffeine in a cup of coffee
and the baked goods com-
monly found in cafes. The
entrepreneurial path was a
sharp digression from Bogdan's
original plan to apply to medi-
cal school. However, he said the
long process to becoming a doc-
tor lost its appeal.
"I realized I had a good idea,
I'm still young and I really
didn't have anything to lose,"
Bogdan said. "The way I look
at it is that I could graduate and
get a job or I could start a busi-
ness."

During his busy schedule as
a student, Bogdan found him-
self stopping into local cafis
such as Espresso Royale to grab
a quick coffee and muffin.
"Basically I was spending $6
to $7 a day because I didn't have
time to make breakfast," Bog-
dan said. "I wanted something
that was convenient but also
that was a better price."
During his junior year at
the University, Bogdan's kitch-
en turned into a "lab," as he
experimented with crushing
and purifying caffeinated pills
to add into muffins. When this
combination didn't work out,
Bogdan began using coffee
bean extract- a natural form of
caffeine that does not require
the masking of any bitter taste.
"Thewholeideaisthatyou're
getting a cheaper product that's
kind of killing two birds with
one stone, but also something
that's convenient and quick,"
Bogdan said.
Until this past fall, Get Up
and Go items were only sold
online. The 7-Eleven at 1300
S. University Ave. underneath
Landmark was the first busi-
ness to sign on and agree to sell
the product.
"I've literally been in retail
for six months, so it's really
been the past six months that
have proved this is a viable
business," Bogdan added.
Get Up and Go products can'
now be found at twenty loca-

Keynote speakers
address methods
of attaining joy,
fighting depression
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Observe. Connect. Act. - This
is the motto of Own It, a fledgling
student movement in the College
of Engineering aimed to build
community awareness of mental
health issues since its inception
this fall.
In its second keynote event
Monday, titled "Leading Inclu-
sion: Ending Stigma Around
Mental Health," Own It host-
ed three speakers to address
the importance of combatting
depression among students in
engineering.
Engineeringsenior Luke Brus-
ki, executive director of Own It,
said the organization's main goal
is to foster academic success by
encouraging inclusivity within
the College of Engineering.
"Own It is a challenge to the
Michigan Engineering com-
munity to be our most authentic
selves and to support others in
doing the same," he said.
Bruski added there is a culture
of poor mental health awareness
at the University - an assertion
substantiated by data presented
by Public Health Prof. Daniel
Eisenberg Monday night.

Lecture examines possible
Medicaid expansion effects

Harvard Prof. says
current system fails
to meet needs of low-
income population
By AMABEL KAROUB
Daily StaffReporter
June 28, 2012, the Supreme
Court voted the U.S. govern-
ment could not require states
to expand Medicaid under the
Patient Protection and Afford-
able Care Act. Today, 26 states
and the District of Columbia

have chosen to expand Medic-
aid, and the other 24 have yet to
do so.
At the University's School of
Public Health Monday night,
Benjamin Sommers, assistant
professor of Health Policy &
Economics at Harvard School
of Public Health, discussed the
implications of the Supreme
Court's decision regarding
Medicaid expansion.
Sommers said a Medicaid
expansion is overdue because,
contrary to popular percep-
tions, Medicaid does not cover
most underprivileged individu-
als. Medicaid has traditionally

covered low-income people who
have a disability, are pregnant,
are under 18 or are parents of
children who live at home. But
these categories fail to capture
the majority of the low-income
uninsured.
"What's conspicuously
absent from those categories are
the bulk of uninsured - adults
between the ages of 19 and 64,"
Sommers said. "Because they
don't have a child who live in
the home and they don't have a
disability, they're not eligible."
The ACA proposed that Med-
icaid be expanded to every per-

Mario Mateo is a professor of
astronomy specializing in instru-
mentation and the spectroscopy
of stellar bodies in the universe.
He received his BA at Rice Univer-
sity and Ph.D at the University of
Washington. He completed Carn-
egie and Hubble fellowships at
Carnegie Observatories and has
worked at the University for 21
years.
What classes do you teach?
In the past couple of years I've
mostly been teaching an intro-
ductory astrophysics course
called "Aliens in the Sky," and also
in the last year I've been teaching
an advanced introductory course

for our potential majors. Also,
this semester I've been teaching
an introductory class on galaxies.
What kind of research
do you do?
My research is primarily in
observational astronomy. I do
work using spectrographs at the
Magellan telescope in the South-
ern Hemisphere, which is partly
operated by the University in
consortium with other universi-
ties. I've done two things that are
relevant to that in the past few
years. One, I've just actually fin-
ished building an instrument for
that telescope and in the past six
months we've began to use that

instrument effectively. A lot of
my research is devoted to looking
at fairly nearby galaxies that you
can actually see the individual
stars there and from that try to
study how the stars are moving
within their gravitational field.
Which one of your projects
or research are you
most proud of?
The main thing is the stuff that
we did with our earlier version of
this instrument, where we were
actually able to determine details
about how the mass is distributed
within these galaxies.

Student org. announces
theme for fall conference

Michigan Sports
Business Conference
to examine role of
game changers'
By EMILIE PLESSET
Daily StaffReporter
The Michigan Sport Business
Conference unveiled the theme
for their third annual event as
"Game Changers: Innovating
Today. Defining Tomorrow."
The conferennce will be Oct. 24,
though a has yet to be
finalized.
Founded in 2011 by Univer-
sity alumni Brandon Rhodes and
Dustin Cairo, MSBC aspires to
inspire future sports business
professionals and provide stu-
dents access to industry leaders
on campus.
Kinesiology junior David
Herman, MSBC co-president,
H-o

said MSBC is the only student-
run undergraduate conference.
While other professional busi-
ness events may be expensive to
attend, MSBC aims to provide
students with networking oppor-
tunities at alower cost.
"Our model is to bring that
same caliber of eager quality and
networking opportunity into a
student university environment
for a very affordable cost to our
students," Herman said.
Herman said that while the
themes of previous conferences
have focused on how the sports
industry has changed in the
past, this year the conference
will focus on how the industry
will innovate and progress in the
future.
"There are a lot of cool things
going on in the background of
sports that a lot of people don't
know about," said Kinesiology
junior Josh Kadden, MSBC brand
and website director. "We want
to focus this year on what the
5-.

next 10 years are going to be in
sports and how the game changer
are changing tomorrow."
The conference will host
about 500 people, including 30
to 40 speakers, sponsors, alum-
ni, industry professionals and
almost 400 students from the
University and other schools
throughout the country.
"We want to spread the great
work we're doing and give stu-
dents who are interested in the
industry opportunity," Herman
said.
MSBC will announce its
speakers for the upcoming con-
ference in the fall. Past speakers
have included ESPN President
John Skipper, Monday Night
Football announcer Mike Tirico
and real estate mogul Stephen
M. Ross, a donor to the Univer-
sity and owner of the Miami Dol-
phins, among others.
Herman said that this year's
speakers will reflect the confer-
ence's theme of innovation and
leadership.
"This year we really want to
try and find those people, those
companies, individuals, teams
who are looking for what the
next decade will bring in sports
business," Herman said. "We are
really looking for people who are
creating new things today and
are trying to change things up or
do something new."
The MSBC planning team is
looking into different ways of
speaker presentation to further
engage students and increase
networking opportunities. In the
past the conference was set up in
apanel format, butthisyearthere
may be more of a debate format.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Man found guilty
in family killings
A jury has found a 29-year-old
Detroit man guilty of first-degree
murder for gunning down his
7-year-old daughter, grandmoth-
er and aunt.
Police report that Ferdarius
Shine's mother told them he ran
from the house after the Feb. 15,
2013, shootings, screaming that
"the devil" made him do it.
He surrendered at a psychiatric
hospital the next day and under-
went a mental competency exam
before his trial in Wayne County
Circuit Court. A jury convicted
him Monday.
The victims were Shines'
daughter Amera Jones, his
49-year-old aunt Santangela Wil-
liams and his 68-year-old grand-
mother Geraldine Bates.
Investigators say he had a con-
cealed weapon license.
First-degree murder in Michi-
gan carries a mandatory penalty
of life in prison without the pos-
sibility of parole.
SAN FRANSISCO, Calif.
Several Smart cars
found vandalized
Four Smart cars were flipped
over in an apparent vandalism
spree Monday in two San Fran-
cisco neighborhoods.
Police said they didn't know
whether the attacks were a prank
or another episode in escalating
tensions among some residents
who blame the tech industry for
rising rents and cost of living.

without any suspects identified or
in custody," said Officer Gordon
Shyy, a police spokesman who
said the culprits would face felony
vandalism charges.
The first car was found flipped
on its roof around 1 a.m., and a
second was spotted on its side
around a couple of blocks away
about10 minutes later in the city's
Bernal Heights neighborhood,
said Shyy, a police spokesman.
WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.
Driver investigated
in train derailing
An engineer driving a speed-
ing commuter train that derailed
last year, killing four people, had
a sleep disorder that interrupted
his rest dozens of times each
night and said he felt strangely
"dazed" right before the crash,
according to federal documents
released Monday.
Asked if he was clearheaded
enough to realize he was enter-
ing a curve just before the-Dec. 1
derailment inthe Bronx, engineer
William Rockefeller told investi-
gators "apparently not."
The Metro-North Railroad
train hit the curve, which has aO30
mph speed limit, at 82 mph. More
than 70 people were injured.

CAIRO
Four prominent
activists convicted
An appeals court on Mon-
day upheld the convictions and
three-year prison sentences
handed down to three of Egypt's
most prominent political activ-
ists, a ruling that is likely to
revive opposition to a draconian
protest law they were accused of
violating.
It is also certain to deepen the
rift between the current mil-
itary-backed government and
Egypt's liberal and secular pro-
democracy campaigners, many
of whom participated in the
2011 popular uprising against
Hosni Mubarak.
The ongoing campaign
against dissent and pro-democ-
racy activists has been over-
shadowed by a much larger
crackdown against the Muslim
Brotherhood group and other
Islamists. That push has led to
the death of hundreds and the
jailing of at least 16,000 people
since the July ouster of Presi-
dent Mohammed Morsi.
The verdict swiftly drew con-
demnation from international
rights groups.

possible need for it after evalu-
ating the effectiveness of the
ordinance's self-enforcement for
one year.
Warpehoski responded to
Kunselman's concerns regard-
ing the penalty by stating the
proposed legislation was not
simply a suggestion.
"We have a code of ordinanc-
es," Warpehoski said. "Not a
book of suggestions."
Warpehoski also responded
to concerns of some council-
members - including Lumm
and Kailasapathy - that imple-
mentation of this ordinance by
law enforcement officers would
detract from their focus on more
pressing issues.
Warpehoski cited a study
regarding a similar smoke-free

ordinance as evidence that
such claims are unsubstanti-
ated. A 2014 study of municipal
costs stemming from Ontario,
Canada's smoke-free ordinance
found that no significant costs
were incurred as a result of the
ordinance.
Ellen Rabinowitz, Washt-
enaw County's interim director
of public health, spoke at the
meeting in favor of the legisla-
tion. She noted that of the 12
years that a similar smoke-free
ordinances have been in place
throughout the county, only
about 400 complaints have been
made - none of which were
complaints about repeat offend-
ers. Rabinowitz noted that
the bill has been "largely self-
enforcing."
UHS director Robert Win-
field, the University's chief
health officer, also attended
Monday night's meeting to give
imput regardingthe University's

smoke-free policy.
"This is a difficult subject,
but when we were considering
the issues for the University of
Michiganweunderstoodthatwe
wanted to behave ina respectful
way to smokers," Winfield said.
"But we also wanted to set up a
healthy campus."
Winfield added that a com-
bination of social pressure and
education has limited the num-
ber of smokers causing issues on
the University's campus.
"Our central campus is a very
nice example of a practically
smoke-free place with no heavy-
handed enforcement," Winfield
said.
The council also unanimous-
ly passed a resolution against
Michigan Attorney General Bill
Schuette and Republican Gov.
Rick Snyder's efforts to appeal
the March 21, 2014 decision of
DeBoer v. Snyder overturning
the ban on same-sex marriage.

Although the resolution is
largely symbolic, it follows the
on city council's precedent of
supporting rights for LGBTQ
citizens.
While Councilmember Tay-
lor is the sponsored the resolu-
tion, five other members of city
council signed on as co-spon-
sored including Mayor John
Hieftje, Margie Teall (D-Ward
4), Lumm, Briere and Warpe-
hoski.
Taylor criticized Snyder's
defense of the appeal and the
lauded Judge Friedman's deci-
sion.
"It does not advance any con-
ceivable legitimate state inter-
est," Taylor said.
Warpehoski also spoke on
the issue, and said he hopes
the resolution will move the
city and state forward to a day
where "marriage is just mar-
riage for everybody who loves
each other."


MEDICAID

son whose income is lower than
138 percent of the federal pov-
erty line. Sommers said such an
expansion would help the bulk
of low-income individuals, who
many assumed it was helping
already.
"The ACA essentially said
forget about these categories -
if you are low-income and you
meet legal residence qualifica-
tions, you can get Medicaid,"
Sommers said. "It essentially
gives the country the Medicaid
program many people think we
already have."
Sommers said the expanded
Medicaid program looks great
on paper. If a state chooses to
expand Medicaid, the federal
government promises to cover
costs of the newly eligible for the
first three years and at least 90
percent until 2020. For citizens
formerly eligible for Medicaid,
government contribution will
remain the same -60 percent or
less, on average.
Although this seems large,
Sommers said states that have
not expanded harbor important
concerns, such as the affect of
expansion on state budgets. Due
to the immense outreach sur-

rounding the ACA, many people
who were previously eligible for
Medicaid but had not signed up
would enroll after expansion.
The federal government will not
increase coverage for previously
eligible enrollees, and the states
could face high costs.
"There are actually about 10
million people in the U.S. who
were already eligible for Med-
icaid but just hadn't signed up,"
Sommers said. "It could drive up
costs for the states. They have to
pay 25-50 percent of the costs for
those people."
Sommers said a majority of
states also believe the federal
government will not follow
through on covering costs.
"Two-thirds of these states
that are expanding Medicaid
predict that the federal govern-
ment is.not going to hold up its
end of the bargain," he said.
"These officials have no more
insight into that issue than I do
or than you do - they're guess-
ing."
Sommers spent a large part
of the lecture discussing what
states can expect when they
expand Medicaid. He cited
states that expanded Medicaid
relatively early, meaning in 2010
or 2011, including Connecticut,
New Jersey, Minnesota, Wash-
ington and California, lessons
and examples for the program's

implementation.
Sommers listed a few lessons
of these early expansions. He
said states gained many more
enrollees than expected and
the states that were not politi-
cally divided encountered fewer
problems when implementing
the Medicaid expansion.
Some states are choosing to
expand Medicaid using alter-
natives to the federal system.
Arkansas was the first state to
implement the 'private option,'
which takes the federal Med-
icaid funding and puts all
would-be enrollees into private
insurance plans.
In an article published Mon-
day in the Journal of the Ameri-
can Medical Association, Public
Policy Prof. John Ayanian, who
co-authored the JAMA view-
point with two graduate stu-
dents, wrote that the level of
state autonomy with regards to
ACA implementation has led to
uncertainty over the law's effec-
tiveness.
"State flexibility is a dou-
ble-edged sword," the authors
wrote. "By shifting some diffi-
cult decisions from the federal
government, states can tailor
health reform to the needs of
their stakeholders. But imple-
menting reform through the
states increases the number of
elected officials able to influence

implementation."
The article notes that, across
the nation, Michigan is one of
only five states to accept a fed-
eral Medicaid waiver, which
provides federal funding for
expansion while allowing states
to maintain a larger degree
of self-governance. Arkansas,
Iowa, Indiana and Pennsylvania
are the others that have either
implemented or are in the pro-
cess of implementing similar
programs.
While this option uses private
health insurance companies,
it appears to experience less
resistance from conservative
lawmakers, who want to avoid
increasing Medicaid enrollment,
the authors noted that the state-
run plans could become "vul-
nerable to shifts in the political
climate at the state and federal
levels," especially after the 2016
presidential election.
Public Health student Lau-
ren Kuenstner said she finds it
regrettable that some states have
not expanded Medicaid.
"It's unfortunate that so many
uninsured people are essentially
political pawns." Kuenstner
said. "A lot of governors don't
want to expand Medicaid purely
for ideological reasons, and the
people who are uninsured are
the ones suffering the conse-
quences."

"The social network and the

Desprez said.
Hower spoke about the chang-
es the University is considering

due to concerns that newstudents
have easy access to parties and
alcohol, posing a high risk of irre-
sponsible drinking.
Another concern expressed
is the time students have before

moving to Ann Arbor. Several
speakers expressed concerns that

ly for new students.

ing an Indiegogo campaign on

ENGINEERING

Eisenberg presented results
from both nationwide and Uni-
versity studies on mental health.
According to a survey of 29
schools, 32 percent of students
face some type of mental health
challenge, and 9 percent suffer
from major depression.
However, Eisenberg said
engineering students at the Uni-
versity have a slightly higher
prevalence of mental health
problems, hovering around 40
percent of students surveyed.
He added that engineering
students have also proven to be
less likely to use mental health
services at the University, such
as Counseling and Psychological
Services. He said there is a rea-
son for this discrepancy.
"The first thing people usu-
ally think of is stigma and nega-

tive attitudes about seeking help
or about disclosing mental ill-
ness," Eisenberg said. "But we
actually see - and this is con-
sistent across, really, most of
the campuses - that very small
percentage of students actually
agree with the statement that's
intended to measure stigma: 'I
think less of people who receive
mental health treatment.'"
Following Eisenberg's pre-
sentation, University alum Blake
Wagner, a research specialist
in the School of Public Health,
screened a public service
announcement produced by Ink-
blots, an organization he started
with his father to address issues
of depression amongstudents.
The short film, "Treadmill,"
highlighted four major steps to
coping with stress and insecu-
rity: stop, breathe, reflect and
choose. Wagner said these are
a reflection of Inkblots' general
slogan: "Tiny shifts can lead to
big changes."

University alum Richard
Sheridan, the CEO of local Ann
Arbor tech company Menlo
Innovations, was the final
speaker at the event.
He said he founded Menlo
Innovations because he was
tired of the standard bureau-
cracy of software development,
which had at one point instilled
in him "a personal trough of dis-
illusionment."
According the Menlo Inno-
vations website, the company's
mission is to end human suffer-
ing in the world as it relates to
technology.
Sheridan said this concept
requires a unique working envi-
ronment with open workspace
that embraces "the serendipity
of noise" to maximize produc-
tivity. He added that this meth-
od is conducive to collaboration,
which is required of his employ-
ees.
Sheridan said students must
not be afraid to persevere in the

face of disappointment, because
fear of failure is an obstacle to
joy.
"I can tell you that in your
work lives, as you go forward,
most things you think about will
be shot down before you ever
try them," he said. "We pierce
through that at Menlo with one
simple phrase: 'Let's run the
experiment.'"
Angie Farrehi, the assistant
director of student affairs in the
College of Engineering and Own
It's faculty adviser, said this
mindset - fostering inclusion
and "running the experiment"
- is exactly what the student
movement seeks to encourage.
"Own It takes on the chal-
lenge of improving the climate
and connectedness of our com-
munity," she said. "Those two
pieces are integral to any key-
note event ... with the end result
of hopefully improving success
of our students."

Ships hunting for 'pings' in continuing plane search

Hunt reaches
critical stage as
beacon battery
nears depletion
PERTH, Australia (AP) -
Search crews hunting for the
missing Malaysia Airlines jet
have failed to relocate faint
sounds heard deep below the
Indian Ocean that officials said
were consistent with a plane's
black boxes, the head of the
search operation said Tuesday.
Angus Houston, the retired
Australian air chief marshal who
is heading the search far off Aus-
tralia's west coast, said sound
locating equipment on board the
Ocean Shield has picked up no
trace of the signals since they
were first heard late Saturday
and early Sunday.
Time may have already run
out to find the devices, whose
locator beacons have a battery
life of about a month. Tues-

day marks one month since the
plane vanished. Once the bea-
cons blink off, locating the black
boxes in such deep water would
be an immensely difficult, if not
impossible, task.
"There have been no further
contacts with any transmission
and we need to continue (search-
ing) for several days right up to
the point at which there's abso-
lutely no doubt that the batter-
ies will have expired," Houston
said.
If, by that point, the U.S. Navy
listening equipment beingtowed
behind the Ocean Shield has
failed to pick up any signals, a
sub on board the ship will be
deployed to try and chart out
any debris on the sea floor. If the
sub maps out a debris field, the
crew will replace the sonar sys-
tem with a camera unit to photo-
graph any wreckage.
Houston's comments contra-
dicted an earlier statement from
Australia's acting prime min-
ister, Warren Truss, who said
search crews would launch the

Bluefin 21 autonomous sub on
Tuesday.
The towed pinger locator
detected late Saturday and early
Sunday two distinct, long-last-
ing sounds underwater that are
consistent with the pings from
an aircraft's "black boxes" -
the flight data and cockpit voice
recorders, Houston said, dub-
bing the find a promising lead in
the monthlong hunt for clues to
the plane's fate.
Still, officials warned it could
take days to determine wheth-
er the sounds were connected
to Flight 370, which vanished
March 8 on a flight from Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing
with 239 on board.
"This is an herculean task -
it's over a very, very wide area,
the water is extremely deep,"
Defense Minister David John-
ston said. "We have at least sev-
eral days of intense action ahead
of us."
Houtson said finding the
sound again was critical to nar-
rowing down the search area

before the sub can be used. If
the vehicle went down now with
the sparse data collected so far,
it would take "many, many days"
for it to cover all the places the
pings might have come from.
"It's literally crawling at the
bottom of the ocean so it's going
to take a long, long time," Hous-
ton said.
Despite the excitement sur-
rounding the Ocean Shield's
sound detections, Houston
warned that the search had pre-
viously been marred by false
leads - such as ships detecting
their own signals. Because of
that, other ships cannot be sent
in to help with the underwater
search, as they may add unwant-
ed noise.
"We're very hopeful we will
find further evidence that will
confirm the aircraft is in that
location," Houston said. "There's
still a little bit of doubt there, but
I'm a lot more optimistic than I
was one week ago."
Finding the black boxes is key
to unraveling what happened

to the Boeing 777, because they
contain flight data and cock-
pit voice recordings that could
explain why the plane veered so
far off-course.
"Everyone's anxious about
the life of the batteries on the
black box flight recorders," said
Truss, who is acting prime min-
ister while Tony Abbott is over-
seas. "Sometimes they go on for
many, many weeks longer than
they're mandated to operate for
- we hope that'll be the case in
this instance. But clearly there
is an aura of urgency about the
investigation."
The first sound picked up
by the equipment on board the
Ocean Shield lasted two hours
and 20 minutes before it was
lost, Houston said. The ship then
turned around and picked up a
signal again - this time record-
ing two distinct "pinger returns"
that lasted 13 minutes. That
would be consistent with trans-
missions from both the flight
data recorder and the cockpit
voice recorder.

Recognizing gifted students
Developing academic talent is imperative to Michigan's future
Michigan is currently one of nine states that doesn't provide
any funding or support for accelerated education in local and
intermediate school districts. The 2015 budget proposed by Gov.
Rick Snyder allocates $1.8 million to support dual enrollment programs for
high school students. Though this would allow high school students to earn
college credits, money also needs to be allocated to programs and after
school activities that encourage gifted students to challenge themselves
academically and develop targeted interests from an early age.

Though accelerated education programs
funded by independent districts and high
schools exist, the range of gifted education
services available to students in the state is
extremely limited. The Michigan Department
of Education does provide information
concerning the "Talent Development"
programs offered by the state, however the
information hasn't been updated in the past
four years. It's worrisome that the state has
taken such a passive approach to developing the
academic talent of its young citizens.
Snyder's current budget proposal is a
constructive step toward recognizingthe needs
of gifted students. Additionally, providing
college credit to high school students is a
constructive way to reduce the cost of attending
college. Though Advanced Placement programs
offer college credit to students, high schools are
inconsistent in the range of AP courses they
offer. For example, the Three River's school
districtin Kalamazoo lacks sufficient resources
to offer AP programs to its students. By funding
dual enrollment programs, the state can ensure
that students get credit, while receive an
education on par with that of a college course.
Dual enrollment also enables students to pick
classes and take ownership of their education,
easing their transition into college life.
Though programs for high school
students require immediate attention,
Snyder's administration should also look
toward providing funding to programs that
encourage gifted students to actively pursue
their interests, especially at the elementary
NICOLE ROJAS I

level. Support for after-school activities
should be expanded at the elementary level
so that all students have equal opportunity
to pursue an accelerated education in the
future. This is especially necessary to avoid
creating a dichotomy between high- and low-
achieving kids. Challenging young learners
and inspiring interest early on can prevent
students from underestimating their abilities
and falling behind.
Expensive after-school programs that
currently exist don't receive state funding,
and therefore most students miss out on such
opportunities. The state should have mandates
in place that allow all students easy access to
such programs in their early development.
Since these programs would supplement their
education, students should also be allowed to
join or drop the program after a year.
As students move to middle school and
high school, gifted students can be identified
through already existing statewide exams
such as the MEAP and Michigan Merit
Examination. Using the results of these
tests, along with other academic indicators,
can help administrators of gifted programs
identify these students, and take a step toward
providing resources to foster development.
Though some private programs already
provide parents with information to help
their educationally advanced children, a
state mandate needs to be created in order to
implement programs in all schools. Snyder and
the state legislation must provide state funding
to make these programs a reality.

moment to set the record straight.
As this year's Election Director,
I'm a bit biased when I say this, but
I'll say it anyway: Winter 2014's
elections were the best I've seen in
my three years at the University of
Michigan. Yes, there were lawsuits.
Yes, some candidates and parties
were issued demerits for failing to
adhere to the rules.

But it's important that students
know the truth: no litigation resulted
in any altering of any election. Let
me repeat that: not one election
was won or lost this year due to
election-related litigation. Not one.
Nada. Zip. Zero. Every candidate
who swears an oath of office in the
coming weeks will do so because
he or she won the most weighted
votes, period.
Being something of an election-
insider, I agree that it can be
frustrating to see the Election Code
as it stands right now. I argued as
much in my dissent in Fernandez
v. ForUM, et al. (you can read the
UEC's opinions online). I agree
with Mr. Brennan that some of
the rules in the Election Code
are hypertechnical nonsense that
probably confuse more than they
elucidate. But consider this: even
if we designed the perfect Election

Code, the elections themselves still
wouldn't be perfect. Why? Because
the only way to ensure positive, fair
outcomes is to sit down with all the
candidates and talk things through
before campaigningbegins.
And that's exactly what we did this
year. We talked about how student
confidence in CSG declines when
people win because of lawsuits. We
discussed why it's not just whether
you win, but how you win, that mat-
ters. And we talked about respect-
ing other candidates, no matter how
fierce and heated the campaigngets.
I agree with Mr. Brennan that the
code must be reformed. But I hope
that he will also agree that while
no election is perfect, this year's
election is a step forward in creating
confidence in CSG elections.

HBO
"Did the president call?"
'Veep' continues to
roll in new season

Even they look bored
'Friends with Better
Lves raditnal fare

Hilarity ensues as
Selina begins her
presidential campaign
By CHLOE GILKE
Daily Arts Writer
Just like "Game of Thrones,"
the other returning HBO Sunday
favorite, "Veep," has always been
a show about
power. Vice
President Selina
Meyer (Julia Veep
Louis-Dreyfus,
"Seinfeld") often Season
misfires and
rarely seems to Premiere
have it together, HBO
but when it
comes down to
it, Selina is ruthless. She lives for
the moments when a higher-up
falls ill and jumps at the chance to
occupy a vacated post of authority.
She's the comedy version of Kevin
Spacey's Frank Underwood in
"House of Cards" - she'd do
anything to ascend the throne.
But thankfully, "Veep" isn't
just a show about angsty men and
political conspiracy. Its rapid-fire
jokes and sardonic humor point to
showrunner Armando Ianinucci's
well-honed British sense of humor.
It's dark without resorting to plot
contrivances and its biting satire of
American government is spot-on.
Selina is power-hungry and often
ridiculous, but underneath her
silly antics she is just really good
at her job. She's a master at playing

the game.
Season three brings us to Selina
on the campaign trail, promoting
her new book "Some New
Beginnings: Our Next American
Journey" (she comments on the
lame title, but says that the other
options she was given were far
worse) while also tryingto suck up
to the good citizens of the nation's
premier caucus state: Iowa. Selina
is usually at the top of her game
when faced with acrowd of people
(and an assistant at her side), but
with most of her staff attending
coworker Mike's wedding,
Selina is thrown. Replacing the
freakishly attentive Gary (Tony
Hale, "Arrested Development"),
who even at the wedding
continues to facilitate small talk,
is a less-skilled wannabe who tells
the long line of patrons at Selina's
book signing that she is helping
a senator with very important
and very dire problems. His weak
excuses are especially hilarious
because he seems to be the only
character on "Veep" who isn't
flawlessly successful at navigating
the political machine.
Even at the wedding (which
is between Selina's director of
communications and a reporter),
politics rule. Groom Mike (Matt
Walsh, "'The Hangover") requires
the attendees to place their
phones in a bowl so the guests
are not distracted, but when Gary
gets a call during his speech,
chaos takes over. Thanks to a leak
from everyone's favorite piece of
garbage, Dan Egan, (Reid Scott,
"My Boys"), everyone learns that

the president will not be running
for reelection, and even in the
midst of Mike's wedding, the
politicians and staff can't help but
reach for their phones and keep
up with the news. But even Mike,
who is often the butt of the joke
for obsessing over his boat and his
(probably fake) dog, is energized
by the news. He graciously allows
his guests to grab their phones
out of the bowl and even engages
in some calls and news briefs
himself. Just like everyone else,
politics is his life.
The urgency of the presidential
campaign gives the season three
premiere a much-needed jolt.
While past episodes were always
strong, the humor often derived
from the claustrophobic setting
of Selina's office and the stagnant
opportunities. Dan and Amy were
antsy for promotions that meant
little, White House liason Jonah
(the fabulous Timothy Simons)
marched around the place like a
dictator and Selina had nothing
better to do than spin around in
her office chair. But the ultimate
test of Selina's willpower and
political prowess comes from the
opportunity for real power. The
new sense of urgency is palpable
even in the premiere. This is
Selina's one chance at the throne,
and if she fails, the loyalty of Dan,
Amyand Garyis likelyto snap. But
as of right now, Selina's the golden
girl of D.C. and has the tenacity
and determination to make it
through this campaign. Whether
she succeedsor not, the results are
sure to be hilarious.

M' finds success despite new defense

Bakich makes
important
defensive changes

By BRAD WHIPPLE
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan baseball
team has been mixing up the
defensive alignment in the most
high-stakes moments.
The Wolverines (4-5 Big
Ten, 14-17-1 overall) have won
five of their last eight games
while constantly altering the
defense in the midst of heated
conference play. But the
experimentation is seemingly
working to Michigan's
advantage in the field.
"We've shuffled so many
lineups this season," said
Michigan coach Erik Bakich. "I

Rumors swirled about
whether or not the Wolverines
would play their third-ever
home night game in the 2014
season. The first two night
games, which took place in
2011 and 2013, were both
against Notre Dame. But with
Michigan facing the Fighting

in the programs' last scheduled
matchup, also scheduled to be
a night game, the primetime
opponent was in question. The
Wolverines won their first two
night games against the Notre

But after the Athletic
Department's announcement
Monday, the news is out and the

Wolverines will playthe Nittany
Lions at 7 p.m. in a nationally
televised game on ESPN or
ESPN2. It will be Michigan's
second night game of the season,
as its matchup against Notre
Dame, in week two, is slated for
a 7:30 start time.
"The night game atmosphere
created by our fans has been
electric and we expect that same
type of energy for our first-ever
conference night game against
Penn State," said Michigan
coach Brady Hoke on MGoBlue.

enjoy playing in primetime at
Michigan Stadium."
In the first two night games,
Michigan Stadium set the
attendance record with the

softball coach Where:
Carol Hutchins Alumni Field
and her
fifth-ranked'
Wolverines don't take games
against local competition lightly.
These games allow Michigan to
tinker with still-unrefined parts
of its game.
"When you get down to the
end of the season, you don't really
think about what happened to you
in February," Hutchins said on
Sunday. "It's all about May. We
play for May."
The biggest of those concerns -
the depth of the pitching rotation
has been largely laid to rest after
last weekend's Ohio State series.
Freshman right-hander Megan
Betsa, who struggled with nerves
in her first home game of the
season against Indiana, has since
allowed only one hit in her last
two games.
The turnaround has its roots in
a midweek game. Hutchins didn't
start Betsa during a weekend
series against lowly Penn State
on March28-29, instead optingto
instill confidenceinthe freshman
during a Wednesday game
against Detroit. Betsa responded
by throwing a no-hitter, and has
looked confident and poised ever
since.
It's exactly that kind of
development that Hutchins looks
for in these games against lesser
competition. The atmosphere
allows her to watch how the rest
of the Wolverines perform under
pressure. Michigan (9-0 Big .
Ten, 29-6 overall) even tries to
create these stressful scenarios in
practice, using full-count drills to
challenge both the pitchers and

the hitters.
But game scenarios don't just
build confidence, they demand it.
"You give me a player with
confidence and they're worth
way more than anybody who's
just their physical self," Hutchins
said. "That confidence makes you
twice the player."
Western Michigan (2-4
MAC, 11-23) won't threaten the
Wolverines often on Tuesday. The
Broncos have just two starters
hitting above .300 and both of
their pitchers are struggling to
the tune of losing records and
earned-run-averages over 3.5.
Still, the matchup against
the Broncos lets Michigan see
the in-game intensity they can't
recreate in practice.
The hope is that the more
in-game experience the
Wolverines get, the more cool
and collected they will be when it
counts. The team has come a long
way since February, but it's hard
not to think about Michigan's
late-innings collapse against
No. 6 Florida in the first game of
the year. It's exactly the kind of
scenario Hutchins is working to
eradicate before the postseason.
Since thatgame,the Wolverines
have improved their pitching
and made strides defensively,
but perhaps the biggest leap has
come at the plate in the form of
senior designated player Taylor
Hasselbach.
Hasselbach had never started
more than six games in a season,
but is now an integral part of
Michigan's lineup.
"I approached this season and I
said to myself, 'I have no regrets,'
" Hasselbach said. "I was just
waiting for my opportunity, and
once I got my opportunity to be
in the lineup permanently, it just
flowed from there.
"I'm just lost for words because
I didn't have any expectations
coming in. I feel extremely
blessed tobe in the position Iam."
Hasselbach racked up eight
RBI in Sunday's doubleheader
against Ohio State and has quickly
grown into an offensive force.
Against Western Michigan,
Michigan will look for yet another
player to emerge from its lineup as
Hasselbach and Betsahave, and in
the process, take one step closer
to being ready for May.

Michigan's Mr. Dependable: Matt Freeman

How the walk-on
turned captain
found his role
By CAROLYN KODIS
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan men's gymnastics
coach Kurt Golder was running
out of time.
Just an hour before his team's
flight left for the 2011 Big Ten
Championship, Golder was
thrown a curveball: one of his
gymnasts was sick and unable
to compete, leaving him short
a man for the meet. He went
through the entire roster before
his eyes finally landed on one
name, and a walk-on at that:
Matt Freeman.
Four years ago, asa freshman,
Freeman had only competed in
two meets during the regular
season and his scores weren't
anything special. On this
weekend, though, Golder
couldn't accept any non-special
scores - especially in a season
where Big Ten competition was
at an all-time high. One slip-up
could be the difference between
first place and second. Golder
needed someone who could
deliver a strong performance.
With a potential Big Ten

Championship on the line, the
decision was made.
Freeman had an hour to pack
his things. His team needed
him.
He was having a bizarre
day. Just hours earlier, he
was expecting to watch his
team compete at the Big Ten
Championship from his couch.
Now, he was on the roster
presumably as a back-up. It was
on the bus ride to the meet that
he learned the truth: he wasn't
going as a back-up, but instead
would be competing.
"It got a lot scarier," Freeman
said with a laugh.
Freeman's entire season
played out in his mind. He had
only competed twice, and his
most recent rings performance
at Arizona State ended poorly.
What was coach thinking,
giving him of all people, a
chance to compete at the Big
Ten Championship?
"It was kind of nerve-
wracking," Freeman said.
It wasn't just an ordinary
meet. Each movement was
scrutinized now more than
ever. Freeman earned a 14.55 on
rings, an impressive score and,
at the time, a career-best for
the freshman. Michigan would
finish second in the meet, and
Freeman would find his role.

One word comes to Golder's
mind when he describes the
current senior co-captain Matt
Freeman: dependable.
"He probably has one of the
higher hit-percentages of all the
guys on our team," Golder said.
In a sport of constant scrutiny,
where one slip-up can result
in a major point deduction,
dependability is everything. A
high hit-percentage is a sign
not of consistent excellence but
rather of talent.
Now, Freeman regularly
competes in two of the most
difficult events in men's
gymnastics - pommel horse
and still rings - where a strong
performance can result in major
points.
During Freeman's sophomore
year, he didn't suffer a single
major deduction in a pommel
horse routine all season. On
pommel horse, it's notuncommon
for even the best to slip off the
horse every once in a while. But
for Freeman, it's a rarity.
This season, Freeman has
competed in every meet on
both pommel horse and rings,
consistently scoring well. He
also competed on the high bar -
an event he seldom competes in.
In a critical situation yet again,
Freeman proved dependable
even in a different setting. He
scored acareer-high 14.25 against
Nebraska.
Dependability is a key
component of leadership and of
being a good teammate. And
Freeman isn't just reliable on the
mat, but also outside of the gym.
If someone needs a ride to Meijer,
he'll drive them. If they need to
be dropped off at the airport, he'll
take them. If they need a place to
stay on Thanksgiving, his house
becomes theirs.
"He's been = the most
dependable, most giving guy,"
Golder said. "Everybody knows
that Matt has their back."
When he first joined the
team, Freeman didn't know if
he belonged. It's hard to stand
out in an incoming class of 11
freshmen, especially when
you're a walk-on. Freeman
wasn't the best at any particular
event, so he decided that instead
of trying to stand out, he'd
try to fill in and help the team
wherever he could.
"I decided whatever event we

needed, I'd work on, and that
was (pommel) horse and rings,"
Freeman said.
He didn't make his
competitive debut until the end
of his freshman season against
Penn State, though. He got one
shot: the rings. His 13.90 score
wasn't stellar, but it was a start,
especially in an event that he
wasn't used to.
"He's extremely hard-
working, if not the most hard-
working person on our team,"
said Freeman's co-captain
Syque Caesar. "He came in his
freshman year a little bit out
of shape and then worked his
way through the entire season
and didn't compete a lot, but he
always kept himself ready."
But nothing could've
prepared him for his jump to the
lineup.
The story of walk-on-turned-
captain is not uncommon in
Michigan athletics. Remember
Jordan Kovacs, a safety on the
football team? In the case of
the gymnastics team, both of its
current captains are walk-ons.
Freeman isn't like most
captains, though. His lead-
by-example style trumps the
typical, verbal-leadership rout.
Freeman's work ethic helped
him earn his spot as a captain.
And now Freeman expects
his team to work just as hard.

Donnal was on the stout team
this season, and by seeing the
angles and nuances Morgan and
Horford played with in practice,
he was able to absorb the new
concepts.
"He's still learning the ins
and outs of the game," Morgan
said. "I don't even remember
what I knew in high school, but

Donnal's not sure when
exactly it was, just that it
came around the middle of the
regular season, but he turned
a corner. He'd found success

"I started to pick up

If it wasn't for the redshirt,
Morgan and Horford might

Morgan said. "He's hard to

and he's definitely come a long

"Over the past couple months,

The tentativeness that
plagued Donnal through the
season's first couple months
seemed to disappear.
"Now that I have my
confidence back, I know that
I can play with these guys,"
Donnal said.
The hallmark '5' of the John

Freshman center Mark Donnal has used this season to mature into a force under the hoop and beyond the arc.

Beilein offense is a guy that can
hang with the bestbig men under
the rim, but alsotake his defender
outside to shoot the 3-pointer.
West Virginia sensation Kevin
Pittsnogle was the paradigm for
the type of player Beilein wanted
at that position.
But since he came to
Michigan, Beilein's '5' has
looked less like Pittsnogle and
more like, well, Morgan. The
outside shot has never been a
threat from Beilein's center in
his Michigan days.
With Donnal, though, that

might change.
"He's told me that he's excited
to have a big man that can shoot
threes," Donnal said.
In a 50-minute open practice
at Lucas Oil Stadium a day
before Michigan's Sweet 16
bout against Tennessee, Donnal
showed fans for the first time -
outside of pregame warmups -
what he could do.
He had the most fluid jump
shot of Michigan's big men, he
finished around the rim with
both hands and he had perhaps
the most polished post game

behind Mitch McGary.
Asked if he's thought about
what the team might look like
if Donnal was on the court late
this year, Morgan sidestepped
the question, but made a point
with authority.
"I think about next year," he
said. "I think he's gonna make
a really big difference for this
team next year."
