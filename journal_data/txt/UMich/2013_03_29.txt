Wolverines advance
to the Final Four
for the first time
since 1993
By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
ARLINGTON, Texas - For
the first time in 20 years, the
Michigan men's basketball team
is headed to the Final Four.
Right out of the gates, the
Wolverines unleashed an offen-
sive onslaught on Florida, the
nation's No. 2 defensive team.
Michigan took the game's open-
ing tip and never looked back,
winning79-59.
The victory sends the Wolver-
ines to Atlanta, where they'll play
Syracuse on Saturday for a chance
to appear in the title game. It's
Michigan's first Final Four since
1993, but that run, as well as a
Final Four appearance in 1992,
have been wiped from the record
books. The program's last official
Final Four was the 1989 National
Championship team.
Michigan sealed the win with
its five seniors on the floor to the
chorus of "It's greatto be a Mich-
igan Wolverine" chants through-
out Cowboys Stadium.
"That was the highlight of
the day for me," said redshirt
sophomore forward Jon Horford.
"They deserved it. For them to
get in there and get an opportu-
nity, it was beautiful."
Senior guard Josh Bartelstein
was the first Wolverine to climb
the ladder and snip off a piece of
the nets, as Michigan coach John
Beilein looked on. It's the coach's
first Final Four in his 34 years
coaching.
"I didn't know how to act,
actually," Beilein said. "I just was
silent and in awe of trying to take
everything in."
Afterwards, in the locker
room, Beilein received the first
Gatorade shower of his career.
The Wolverines never trailed

and led by as many as 24 points
in the first half, entering halftime
with a 17-point lead. The eventu-
al 20-point victory was the larg-
est margin in an Elite Eight game
since 1999 until Louisville sur-
passed that margin in the second
Sunday game.
Michigan scored the game's
first 13 points, opening the con-
test on a 23-5 run. Freshman
guard Nik Stauskas broke out of
a recent 3-point shooting slump
in spectacular fashion, draining
his first seven shots including six
from long range.
Stauskas said that he knew
he'd have a big shooting night
after his first shot in pregame
warm-ups went down.
"I was due for one of these
games - it's been a while," he
said. "My teammates did a real
good job of finding me when I
was open. My shot felt good, so I
was just letting them fly."
Each of Stauskas's first four
3-pointers were from the left
corner, where the freshman pri-
marily operates in the offense.
Florida seemingly had no answer
for the spacing Michigan imple-
mented, as it repeatedly left
Stauskas unattended.
"Nik didn't have to do any-
thing, he was just standing in the
corner and we were finding him,"
said junior guard Tim Hardaway
Jr. "Our big men did a great job
of just rolling to the basket and
collapsing defense, and us guards
were just finding him on half
court and on fast breaks. So it
was easy for him."
Stauskas led all scorers with
19 first-half points, includ-
ing back-to-back triples with
five minutes left in the half to
extend the Wolverines' lead to
41-17. Stauskas finished with 22
points, tying his career high on
7-of-8 shooting.
Meanwhile, Florida (14-4
SEC, 29-8 overall) struggled to
connect on nearly anything, as
Michigan played some of its best
defensive ball of the year. The
Wolverines held the Gators to a
2-for-10 clip from 3-point range,

while forcing 15 turnovers.
Michigan, on the other hand,
had one of its most efficient
offensive nights of the year. The
Wolverines shot 52.6 percent
from long range, and outscored
Florida, 21-4, in transition.
Michigan (12-6 Big Ten, 30-7
overall) came out of the locker
room cold, allowing the Gators to
pullwithin12bythe secondhalf's
first official timeout, but the Wol-
verines never flinched. Fresh-
man forward Glenn Robinson
III jammed home a monstrous
dunk out of the break, and fresh-
man point guard Spike Albrecht
stole the ensuing inbound pass
and finished an acrobatic layup.
Florida couldn't muster enough
offense to ever cut the deficit to
less than 12 thereafter.
Albrecht said he's been making
plays like that since high school.
"Sometimes the inbounder
gets a little lackadaisical with
it and they just kind of throw it
out," Albrecht said. "I saw that he
wasn't really looking, so I kind of
faked liked I was going back on
defense and then I just jumped it.
"That was kind of arisk-reward
play. If I missed it, Coach Beilein
would probably have been pretty
upset with me, so I'm just happy it
went our way."
Sophomore point guard Trey
Burke, who was named the South
Region's Most Outstanding Play-
er, finished with 15 points, eight
rebounds and seven assists, while
turning the ball over only once.
Stauskas and McGary, who reg-
istered 11 points and nine boards,
joined Burke on the region's All-
Tournament team.
The Wolverines will take on a
fellow No. 4 seed in the Orange,
renewing a coaching rivalry
between Beilein and Syracuse
coach Jim Boeheim that dates
back to Beilein's days in the Big
East. But preparation for that,
Beilein said, is for another time.
"I know we've got our work
cut out for us, but I'm not going
to worry about that until tomor-
row or maybe the next day,"
Beilein said.

Greek Week to raise
money for charities

Fraternities,
sororities to face
off in competitions
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily News Editor
This week, the University is
going Greek.
During Greek Week - which
lasts for one week starting this

Monday - various fraternity and
sorority chapters across cam-
pus will partake in community
service and fundraising events
including benefit concerts, a step
show and a box car derby.
LSA junior Kelsey Kramer, a
Greek Week representative for
the Pi Beta Phi women's fraterni-
ty, said Greek Week is demonstra-
tive of the true purpose of Greek
life on campus: philanthropy.
"I think a lot of people have this

stereotype of Greek life being,
everyone's constantly partying,"
Kramer said. "But for me at least
that's not what it's all about."
A sorority will team up with
two to three fraternities during
the week to host affiliate events
and competitions. The teams will
compete to raise money for char-
ity, and this year there will be a
holiday theme.
Though there are typically
two to three affiliate events each

news for shippers
Water levels on the Great
Lakes are so low that shippers
are being forced to leave as
much as 15 percent of their cargo

who are working to find ways to
alleviate the problem.
Lakes Michigan and Huron
are about 26 inches below their
long-term monthly averages, and
Lake Superior is about 13 inches
lower, the U.S Army Corps of
Engineers has said. Even though
the lakes are expected to rise 2 to
4 inches in the next month, that's
small consolation for shippers
who are finding the waterways
difficult to navigate.
So officials gathered this week

University shifts focus

Oil spill planned

to non-resident students to overtake Diag

Lack of state
funding made up
for with higher-
paying students
By JENNIFER CALFAS
Daily StaffReporter
Thousands of University stu-
dents pack their bags each win-
ter and hop on an AirBus headed
toward the airport. Once they
arrive, they disperse to 50 states
and 127 countries.
Out-of-state students con-
stitute 38 percent of the stu-
dent population - quadruple
Michigan State's 9-percent
non-resident population, more
than triple University of Cali-
fornia, Berkeley's 10 percent
and exceeding the University of
Wisconsin's 25 percent non-res-
ident cap. Paying nearly $39,000
a year in tuition with room and
board, these students add $88
million to the University's gen-
eral fund annually.
Although the University's
non-resident population has
hovered around 35 to 38 percent
for the past 10 years, it's on the
rise. Due to financial contribu-
tions to the University and the
decliningnumber ofhigh-school
graduates in the state, non-
resident students are a growing
demographic on campus.
After a decade of state fund-
ing cuts for higher education -
over half of which have come
since Republican Gov. Rick Sny-
der took office in 2011- the Uni-
versity's general fund relies on
tuition fees to make up for fund-
ing lost from the state.
In 1970, state appropriation
served as 64 percent of the gen-
eral fund and tuition accounted
for another 26 percent. Now,
due to a decrease in state appro-
priation - which constitutes
$273,056,700, or 16.6 percent
of the University's budget -
tuition continues to increase
and provides 70.2 percent of the
University's current budget.
As the Board of Regents have
approved an average 5.09-per-
cent tuition increase each year
over the past decade, the impact
on non-resident tuition grows.
At the Mackinac Policy Con-
ference in May 2011, University
President Mary Sue Coleman
said she hopes to see more non-
resident students attend the
University.
"We have capacity, and
these students come paying
the full freight," Coleman said.
"They actually add tremen-
dously to the economy of the
state of Michigan."

In 2011, the entering fresh-
man class was 74 percent of
non-resident students from
families with $100,000 or more
income a year, while only 55
percent of in-state students hail
from families from the same
socioeconomic status.
Since non-resident tuition is
comparable in price to a private
university, the University has
less socioeconomic diversity
than it desires. Martha Pollack,
vice provost for academic and
budgetary affairs, said fixing
this issue is at the forefront of
the University's goals for its next
capital campaign.
While the University grants
nearly $190 million to students
for need-based and merit-based
scholarships, they do not meet
the full needs of non-resident
students. To create more eco-
nomic diversity and meet every
student's financial needs, the
goal of the University's next
capital campaign is to provide
full need-based financial aid to
non-resident students.
While the capital campaign
will not begin until November,
the University is already putting
programs in place to begin the
effort. Pollack said last year the
University took half a percent-
age of non-resident tuition to
use as financial aid for non-res-
ident students to meet full need
for students from "Zero EFC" -
zero expected family contribu-
tion - backgrounds.
While Director of Admissions
Ted Spencer said in an e-mail
that all admissions consider-
ations and decisions are made
blind to student need, Univer-
sity Provost Phil Hanlon said a
prospective student's decision to
attend the University should not
be hindered by a lack of financial
aid.
"The students' decision may
not be need-blind," Hanlon said.
"We try really hard to provide
financial aid to a student who's
admitted, depending on what
their need is. We're not where
we want to be; we have a ways to
go still."
While Pollack said the Uni-
versity doesn't purposefully
accept more non-resident stu-
dents due to their financial
contributions, the non-resident
population is at a high due to a
decreasing number of Michi-
gan's high-school graduates.
The state's population consti-
tutes 3.3 percent of the nation's
population, a decrease from
4.4 percent in 1970. Due to
this decrease, there are fewer
18-year-olds eligible for accep-
tance to the University and a
smaller applicant pool from
within the state. While there

were 190,000 18-year-olds in
the state in 1976, there will be
155,000 18-year-olds within the
next year. By 2026, the number
will decrease to120,000.
Pollack said that, accordingto
her calculations, the University
admits five percent of all high
school graduates from the state.
"We try to admit a class so
that the last student we admit
from in-state is just as quali-
fied as the last student we admit
from out-of-state," Pollack said.
"That's why as you see a drop-
off from in-state population,
you're seeing an increase in out-
of-state population."
Joe Greene, the principal
at North Farmington High
School in Farmington Hills,
Mich., said the students who
have equivalent grades to grad-
uates that have been accepted
to the University received more
deferrals and denials in early-
action decisions this year. The
school usually matriculates 40
to 60 seniors to the University
each year.
Greene said he believes the
University continues to enhance
its diversity by accepting non-
resident students, but should
consider "broadening its stan-
dards" to accept a wider variety
of students. He cited former Uni-
versity President James Angell's
belief that the University should
provide "an uncommon educa-
tion for the common man."
"This is a tough leadership
challenge for the University to
figure out," Greene said, adding
there's an intrinsic obligation
to seek a student body that's as
diverse as possible.
While he said the University
must meet full need-based aid
standards of its in-state stu-
dents, Greene acknowledged
thatprovidingaid to out-of-state
students would create a more
diverse student population.
As the next capital campaign
emphasizes providing full finan-
cial aid to its non-resident stu-
dents approachesthe University
plans to inspire donors to target
their donations to scholarships
and human capital rather than
buildings and renovation.
"We need to fashion this in
a way donors can get excited
about the difference they can
make in people's lives so a
lot of this will be storytelling
about what students have done
and what the impact of hav-
ing various scholarships has
been," President Coleman said.
"We need to describe for people
what the need is. They don't
necessarily understand our
unmet need, particularly for
out-of-state students. We can't
be need-blind."

CSG aims to raise
awareness about
sustainability with
week of events
By PAULA FRIEDRICH
Daily StaffReporter
The Central Student Govern-
ment's Environmental Issues
Commission kicked off their
celebration of Earth Week with
a potluck-style dinner in the
Dana Building Sunday night.
Representatives from various
sustainability focused student
organizations sat, ate and chat-
ted about plans for the com-
ing week. Most plans concern
the Diag, which become center
stage for events held this week
by multiple student and com-
munity organizations promot-
ing sustainability.
LSA senior Dana Rollison,
the commission's chair, said the
goal of the week is to increase
awareness of environmental
issues on campus. Relatively
new initiatives will be high-
lighted, such as the push for the
University to remove endow-
ment investments from the fos-
sil fuel industry, which will be
on the Diag Wednesday making
a "photo petition" to send to the
University's Board of Regents.
"The University is so involved
with sustainability research,"
Rollison said. "They have made
it clear in the past few years that
sustainability defines the Uni-
versity of Michigan, they have

made it a goal to decrease car-
bon emissions (and) decrease
waste."
Sunday's "Food Day on The
Diag," headed by the University
of Michigan Student Sustain-
ability Initiative and the CSG
commission, featured a collec-
tion of student organizations
and local businesses show-
casing local and sustainable
food practices alongside an art
installation.
"It's kind of like a papier-
mache tree that's lit up in the
middle of the Diag, and the
roots represent our member
groups which are all the student
groups that are working on sus-
tainable food initiatives around
campus," said Rackham student
Arielle Fleisher, a of member
the UMSSI. "The branches
represent our goals which are
focused on education, commu-
nity building and production."
Tuesday, the commission
will partner with conservation
groups Oceana and the Sierra
Club for a mock oil spill, an
art installation meant to raise
awareness for events like the
2010 oil spill in the Kalamazoo
River. The installation is one of
many events happening around
college campuses in April, said
LSA senior Lydia Geschiere, a
Oceana campus representative
and EIC board member.
"It's literally a giant, shiny,
slippery tarp with hazmat suits
just like an oil spill," Rollison
said.
Other events will focus on
sustainable transportation and
climate change.

Mandela rests in
hospital on Easter

Former president
recovers after
Pneumonia scare
JOHANNESBURG (AP) -
Former South African President
Nelson Mandela had a restful
day in a hospital Sunday and is
improving following treatment
for a recurrence of pneumonia,
the government said.
The office of President Jacob
Zuma thanked South Africans
who prayed for 94-year-old
Mandela at Easter church ser-
vices this weekend, as well as
people at home and around the
world who showed their "love
and support in various ways"
for the anti-apartheid leader
and his family.
"We also thank foreign gov-
ernments for their messages of
support," Zuma's office said in a
statement.
The government "is satisfied
that the doctors are providing
the former president with the
best medical care possible to
enable his recovery and com-
fort. They have reported a
further improvement in his con-

dition," the statement said.
Mandela was admitted to
a Pretoria hospital near mid-
night Wednesday. It was his
third trip to a hospital since
December, when he was treat-
ed for a lung infection and also
had a procedure to remove
gallstones. Earlier in March, he
spent a night in a hospital for
what officials said was a sched-
uled medical test.
"The whole world must come
together and pray for him,"
Zacheus Phakathi, a security
guard, said Sunday at an out-
door service on a hill overlook-
ing Johannesburg.
In Pretoria, the capital,
Henry Hyar, a restaurant wait-
er, standing by a hospital where
Mandela is believed to be, said it
was unfortunate that Mandela
could not be with his family at
home during Easter.
"I'm not happy about it,"
Hyar said. "We're praying for
him to get better as soon as pos-
sible."
On Saturday, Zuma's office
reported that Mandela was
breathing without difficulty
after having a procedure to
clear fluid in his lung area.

Petty politics
CSG should focus on serving students, not suits
From threatening e-mails to controversial campaign advertise-
ments, this year's Central Student Government elections took
a decidedly scandalous turn with students playing the one role
they should've avoided - politicians. Last week, a campaign video
posted by youMICH was removed after a number of students criti-
cized the video as racially insensitive over social media. On Wednes-
day, an e-mail sent by the forUM party chair attacking momentUM
presidential candidate Nick Swider bizarrely resulted in threats of
University Election Commission suits if momentUM made the e-mail
public. After voting ended, both executive candidates on the winning
forUM ticket, LSA juniors Chris Osborn and Hayley Sakwa, have been
disqualified because of suits that seemed soley intent on preventing
them from taking office, pending an appeal. Unfortunately, this year's
scandals are far from the exception. Following the contentious elec-
tions, CSG must refocus on serving the student body and quit wasting
time and money on petty political games.

Reflecting on DP day

n March 23,1,400 Uni-
versity students went to
Detroit
Partnership Day.
It was an amaz-
ing experience
to say the least.
Walking into
Crisler Arena
on Saturday at
8 a.m. to see
hundreds of stu- HARSHA
dents gathered NAHATA
to give their
time was a sight
I'll never forget.
I volunteered for DP Day, and
it was a truly tremendous experi-
ence. My group's site was Historic
Ft.,Wayne. To give a bit of back-
ground on this site, Historic Ft.
Wayne is a fort that dates back to
1840. It was built as reinforcement
in the aftermath of the War of 1812
when the threat of a territorial war
with Britain, and subsequently
Canada, was still a reality. But the
potential war never came to pass,
and the ensuing peace made the
fort a place to train and induct sol-
diers, the first of which arrived at
the onset of the Civil War.
The role of Michigan in the Civil
War is a significant aspect of histo-
ry we often forget. President Abra-
ham Lincoln is believed to have
said, "Thank God for Michigan."
And many of those troops, the ones
that rose to the occasion from the
start, came out of this fort. As a
guide told us, the fort was one of
the last things Michigan troops
saw before being deployed to fight.
Discovering that something
with so much significance and so
much history is less than an hour's
drive away was eye-opening. I'd
never even heard of this site, and
I've lived in Michigan my whole
life. That was a sentiment echoed
by many of the volunteers I went

with. Our site leader, Public Policy
sophomore Raeesa Khan, reflected
on her experience, "I was shocked
by the fact I had no idea this exist-
ed 30 minutes away from my home.
I learned that Detroit has such an
incredibly rich history and culture,
and that it's a shame, especially for
people who live in the area, to not
take advantage of all the city has
to offer."
It was another testament as to
how isolated and removed we've
been from the city of Detroit and
its historical and cultural roots for
the better part of ourlives, and just
how much we have to learn from a
city that's so close.
The work we did there was a
simple clean-up effort: cutting down
and burning dead, overgrown brush.
It wasn't anything spectacular, but
it was exactly what the site needed.
And it made a tangible difference.
Seeing that difference was perhaps .
the most rewarding thing of all.
Not only that, it taught me a
huge lesson. They say that while
a part of service is giving back, a
part of it is also selfish. We vol-
unteer our time, our resources,
ourselves, because we like the feel-
ing of helping and of learning. And
that's often subconsciously howI
approached service - with the atti-
tude of wanting to do something
"substantial." Of not just wanting
to complete mindless tasks, but
wanting to learn about the com-
munity and the people. I assumed
the only way to do that was if I was
performing tasks that I could find
meaning in, tasks that seemed sig-
nificant to me.
DP Day taught me that service
isn't about what you want to do
- it's about what the community
needs. And that if you seek to learn
about a community, even in the
smallest tasks, you'll walk away
having learned more than you can

imagine. I learned that no matter
what you're doing, simply being
there - physically and emotionally
- and witnessing a place, a people
and a community will teach you
eons about circumstances different
from your own.
Weytalked a lot on the bus ride
about community service and ser-
vice learning. I always divided the
two based on the type of work I
was given. Community service to
me was something short term, a
repetitive task I was told to do, me
putting in the hours needed and
then leaving. And service learning
seemed longer, going into a com-
munity, staying there, growing
with them and learning from them.

Service isn't about !
what you want,
but what the
community needs.
I still stand by much of that dis-
tinction, but DP Day has taught me
one important thing: No task is too
small and no time too short. That
service learning can happen in a
day or even a couple hours. That
it's not about what you're doing,
but the mindset you go in with. It's
impossible to ever fully experience
what another person's day-to-day
life is, but it is possible to go into
a community with a willingness
to learn, not impose. To not come
with a preconceived solution, but
with a desire to understand and
serve in whatever way they need.

An open letter to Tit Guy'

ast night I crossed a foggy
road and as the air's mois-
ture clung to the streetlights,
giving each lamp
an atmosphere
all its own, I
thought of you.
Our encounter
must have been
barely a blip in
your sensory
memory, so let EMILY
me remind you PITTINOS
of who Iam.
On the night
of the Michigan
v. Michigan State football game,
I rounded the corner onto Elm
Street to discover you sitting on
an up-ended trash bin with your
buddy smashing beer bottles on
the pavement. With the rest of Ann
Arbor sleeping off an afternoon
of face paint and victory, we were
the only ones around, and through
your own drunken haze you shout-
ed, "Show me your tits!"
I tell this like a funny story
sometimes. I'll be out for sushi
with friends and before I miracu-
lously navigate a spicy tuna roll
into my mouth without smudging
my lipstick, I'll exclaim, "and then
he was like, 'Show me your tits!"'
and people shake their heads and
smile as if to say, what a dick.
But I don't tell this story to make
men seem ignorant or perpetu-
ally rude. I have always fostered a
sure-footed love for guys, and have
realized that many men are like
lychee nuts, soft and sweet inside
their rinds.
So why do I keep telling people
about you, Tits Guy?
Maybe it's because I always get

a laugh, especially when I turn to
self-deprecation, pointing to my
unimpressive chest and adding, "I
don't know why he asked. There
wouldn't have been much to show."
Maybe I'm looking for sympathy,
creating a place for myself among
otherwomenwho have alsobeen
objectified by strangers on the street.
Most likely, I'm trying to prove
my bravery. No matter how viva-
ciously I tell the story, the truth is I
was afraid.
I was already nervous when I
turned onto Elm and surveyed the
situation - me: a five-foot two-
inch, mace-less girl in a short skirt,
and you: a big, wasted stranger
with a glass-breaking friend. When
I walked by, you were slumped
over but solidly planted on that
garbage can, and I instinctually
avoided your eyes. I came so close
you could've tripped me, and in my
pocket I held my keys between my
knuckles so you'd geta mouthful of
metal if you leapt for me.
Once you managed to mutter,
"show me your tits," I was already
past you and only steps from my
friend's front door, through which
cold PBRs and settling smoke and
men who I adore for their good
humor and sweetness were wait-
ing for me. I was nearly safe, but I
wanted to turn around. I wanted to
walk right up to you and yell some-
thing along the lines of, "You kiss
your mama with that mouth?" but
less clich.
I wanted to march my brave little
body over there to prove that women
don't have to fear unfamiliar men
on dark, empty streets and to teach
you about talking to ladies as equals
like I knew you could. "No human

should abuse their ability to make
another feel like an object," I'd say
calmly. You made me feel like a face-
less symbol for woman and sex and I
wanted to let you have it.
But fear kept my cowboy-booted
feet from moving in your direction.
I didn't want to know what would
happen if I approached you, so I
froze like a doe does at the first
sign of danger, and I'm still pissed
about it.
No matter how
I tell the story,
the truth is I
was afraid.
I imagine you years from now.
You come home to your family
after a long day of working with
your hands, and at sunset you say
goodnight to your small children
and crawl into bed with a woman
who both loves and fears you. You
fall asleep thinking about deadlines,
the blurry nights you had in college
and what you want for breakfast
in the morning. I never appear in
your mind's eye, and that's not fair
because on cold nights, when I'm
making my way down an eerily
empty street, I will think of how you
ate up all my confidence with a sin-
gle phrase and my anger will flood
back just as white-hot as it was when
I hurried away from you in the dark.

Chronic conditions
focus of new effort

UMHS looks to
improve palliative
medicine
By MOLLY BLOCK
Daily StaffReporter
With the scope of innova-
tive medical procedures and
treatments available today,
the average life expectancy of
Americans has increased dra-
matically. According to the Cen-
terforDisease Control, however,
nearly half of U.S. adults live
with chronic disease. Palliative
medicine works to help patients
combat these chronic, incurable
diseases.
The newly-formed Adult Pal-
liative Medicine Program at the
University of Michigan Health
System was created to provide
care for chronic diseases based
on interdisciplinary collabora-
tion and the training of doctors
in palliative medicine.
Adam Marks, associate direc-
tor of the UMHS Palliative and
Supportive Care Clinic, sees this
new initiative as building a bet-
ter future for America's aging
population.
"The overall goal of palliative
care is to reduce the symptom
burden and to improve the qual-
ity of life for those living with
chronic, incurable disease,"
Marks said. "The Adult Pallia-
tive Medicine Program, in addi-
tion to providing these services
to patients and their families,
also provides training for the
next generation of palliative
medicine providers."
Another important aspect
of the program is the oversight

steering committee, which will
include representatives from
multiple medical disciplines
and schools at the University
and will enhance the quality of
patient care. Raymond Yung,
chief of geriatric and palliative
medicine at the Medical School,
said this new structure will also
boost UMHS's reputation.
"The main goal is to create
the structure that will enhance
both coordination and national
reputation of clinical education
research for the adult hospice
and palliative medicine pro-
gram at the University," Yung
said.
Built on the spirit of collabor-
ative care, the oversightcommit-
tee for the program is comprised
of a wide array of representa-
tives from the internal medicine
department, including geri-
atric and palliative medicine,
oncology, radiology and general
medicine; the family medicine
department; the School of Nurs-
ing; the School of Social Work;
and the College of Pharmacy.
The program combines pal-
liative care specialists, nurses
and social workers from within
the hospital system, and differ-
ent schools at the University.
"It's beyond departments,"
Yung said. "It's across depart-
ments and across schools
because the School of Nursing,
the School of Pharmacy and the
School of Social Work are all
involved."
The program creates an aca-
demic home for the Hospice and
Palliative Medicine Fellowship
Program, a one-year program
to teach physicians the clinical
skills needed to treat palliative
conditions.

Phillip Rodgers, an assistant
professor in family medicine,
said the collaborative nature
of the program is particularly
important because palliative
patient care often requires
knowledge in multiple special-
ties. For example, he noted that
many patients are in need of
psychological care.
"What has grown over time
in the palliative medicine divi-
sion is that patients and families
have needs across their physical
domains of health - their psy-
chological domains that are in
interpersonal issues with fam-
ily members who are touched
by illness, and spiritual needs,"
Rodgers said.
The program has begun to
look into community engage-
ment as their next overarching
task, Rodgers said.
"In addition to the over-
sight steering committee, we
are in the process of convening
a community board to advise
the steering committee," Rod-
gers said. "What this group is
charged with is setting the stra-
tegic direction of the program."
UMHS and its physicians
have strong relationships with
patient care facilities in the
community - specifically Arbor
Hospice in Ann Arbor - but this
new program opens the door to
strengthen these relationships
in addition to increasing future
community outreach opportu-
nities, Rodgers said.
"Because we've been focused
primarily on building the pro-
graminternally, we haven't done
as much community outreach as
we would like," he said. "But it's
one of our strategic goals for the
new program."

A worker cleans up damage at a Walmart in San Jose, Calif., after a motorist drovethrough a store entrance and began assaulting
shoppers on Sunday.
Four injured in auto
crash at Wal-Mart

Driver assaulted
customers after
hitting Calif. store
SAN JOSE, Calif (AP) - Four
people were hurt Sunday when a
driver crashed his vehicle into a
Wal-Mart and then assaulted cus-
tomers inside, officials said.
Investigators have not deter-
mined how fast the driver -
described as a male in his 30s
- was going at the time of the
crash but the car went about 10
to 20 feet into the store in San
Jose. About 70 people were inside
at the time, police Officer Albert
Morales said.

After the crash at around 11:15
a.m., the unidentified driver got
out of his vehicle and used a blunt
object to attack people, Morales
said. The driver was arrested
when officers arrived.
One person suffered what
Morales described as serious inju-
ries. He did not know the extent
of the injuries to the three other
people but said they were not life-
threatening. One of the injured
included a store employee.
Customer Sharon Kaye told the
San Jose Mercury News the driv-
er sideswiped her car as he made
several runs around the parking
lot before driving between poles
at the entrance and crashing into
the store.

"At first, I thought I may have
done something to anger him
while driving," she said. "But then
I realized he was out to get into
the store."
After the crash, the entrance to
the Wal-Mart was roped off with
yellow police tape, and workers
put up large boards covering the
automatic doors where the car
had entered.
A Wal-Mart spokeswoman told
the Mercury News that the store
remained shut down for sev-
eral hours, and an employee was
among those hurt.
"We're obviously very con-
cerned about the associate who
was injured," spokeswoman Kory
Lundberg said.

Leader: Korean
Peninsula is in a
"state of war"
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - A
top North Korean decision-mak-
ing body issued a pointed warn-
ing Sunday, saying that nuclear
weapons are "the nation's life"
and will not be traded even for
"billions of dollars."
The comments came in a
statement released after North
Korean leader Kim Jong Un pre-
sided over the plenary meeting
of the central committee of the
ruling Workers' Party. The meet-
ing, which set a "new strategic
line" calling for building both a
stronger economy and nuclear
arsenal, comes amid a series of
near-daily threats from Pyong-
yang in recent weeks, including a
vow to launch nuclear strikes on
the United States and a warning
Saturday that the Korean Penin-
sulawas ina "state of war."
Pyongyang is angry over annu-

drills and a new round of U.N.
sanctions that followed its Feb. 12
nuclear test, the country's third.

Analysts see a full-scale North
Korean attack as unlikely and say
the threats are more likely efforts
to provoke softer policies toward
Pyongyang from a new govern-
ment in Seoul, to win diplomatic
talks with Washington that could
get the North more aid, and to
solidify the young North Korean
leader's image and military cre-
dentials athome.
North Korea made reference to
those outside views in the state-
ment it released through the
official Korean Central News
Agency following the plenary
meeting.
North Korea's nuclear weap-
ons are a "treasure" not to be
traded for "billions of dollars,"
the statement said. They "are
neither a political bargaining
chip nor a thing for economic
dealings to be presented to the
place of dialogue or be put on
the table of negotiations aimed
at forcing (Pyongyang) to dis-
arm itself," it said.
North Korea's "nuclear
armed forces represent the
nation's life, which can never be
abandoned as long as the impe-
rialists and nuclear threats exist

on earth," the statement said.
North Korea has called the
U.S. nuclear arsenal a threat to
its existence since the 1950-53
Korean War, which ended in a
truce, not a peace treaty, leaving
the peninsula still technically at
war. Pyongyangjustifies its own
nuclear pursuit in large part on
that perceived U.S. threat.
While analysts call North
Korea's threats largely brink-
manship, there is some fear
that a localized skirmish might
escalate. Seoul has vowed to
respond harshly should North
Korea provoke its military.
Naval skirmishes in disputed
Yellow Sea waters off the Kore-
an coast have led to bloody bat-
tles several times over the years.
Attacks blamed on Pyongyang
in 2010 killed50 South Koreans.
The plenary statement also
called forstrengtheningthemor-
ibund economy, which Kim has
put an emphasis on in his public
statements since taking power
after the death of his father, Kim
Jong II, in late 2011. The United
Nations says two-thirds of the
country's 24 million people face
regular food shortages.

CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's most
popular television satirist, who
every week skewers the Islamist
president and hard-line clerics
on his Jon Stewart-style show,
was released on bail Sunday but
could face charges of insulting
the country's leader and Islam.
Bassem Youssef is the most
prominent critic of President
Mohammed Morsi to be called in
for questioning in recent weeks,
in what the opposition says is a
campaign to intimidate critics
amid wave after wave of politi-
cal unrest in deeply polarized
Egypt.

issued for five prominent anti-
government activists accused of
instigatingviolence.
Deputy chief prosecutor Has-
san Yassin denied the nearly
five-hour interrogation was part
of an intimidation campaign and
said his department was enforc-
ing the law and seeking to estab-
lish some guidelines on freedom
of expression.
"The prosecution is the pro-
tector of social rights and we
work on implementing the law.
... There must be guidelines for
those working in the media to
observe so as not violate the
law," Yassin told The Associated
Press.
Morsi last week accused pri-
vate media of fanning violence
and argued that it was being
used for political aims.
But Yassin denied that the
prosecutor's office was operat-
ing at the behest of the presi-

dency to go after Morsi's critics,
saying it has also interrogated
and sentenced Islamists. Morsi
appointed the chief prosecu-
tor late last year despite an out-
cry from many in the judiciary
who accused him of trampling
on their right to choose the top
prosecutor.
A court ruling last week
declared Morsi's appointment
void, a verdict he will likely
appeal.
"There is no contact between
us and the presidency.... Just like
we moved against someone who
insults Christianity, we moved
against someone who is accused
of insulting Islam," he said.
Youssef is the host of the
weekly political satire show
known for his skits lampoon-
ing Morsi and Egypt's newly
empowered Islamist political
class. But he also mocks the
opposition and the media.

Harris County District Attor-

"I think district attorneys

crowd, kissing babies, smiling
constantly and patting children
on the head.
One admirer of both the pope
and his favorite soccer team
from his Argentine homeland,
Saints of San Lorenzo, insisted
that Francis take a team jersey
he was waving at the pontiff -
"take it, go ahead, take it," the
man seemed to be telling the
pope. Finally, a delighted Fran-
cis obliged, briefly holding up
the shirt, and the crowd roared
in approval. He handed the shirt
to an aide in the front seat, and
the popemobile continued its
whirl through the square.
In a poignant moment, Francis
cradled and kissed a physically
disabled boy passed to him from
the crowd. The child worked
hard to make one of his arms hug
the pope back, then succeeded,
smiling in satisfaction as the
pope patiently waited for the boy
to give his greeting.
Francis has repeatedly put
concern for the poor and suffer-
ing at the center of his messages,
and he pursued his promotion
of the causes of peace and social
justice in the Easter speech he
delivered from the central bal-
cony of St. Peter's Basilica, the
same vantage point above the
square where he was introduced
to the world as the first Latin
American pope on March 13.
The Roman Catholic leader
aimed his Easter greetings at
"every house and every family,
especially where the suffering
is greatest, in hospitals, in pris-
ons." Francis prayed that Jesus
would inspire people to "change
hatred into love, vengeance into
forgiveness, war into peace."
As popes before him have,
he urged Israeis and Palestin-
ians to resume peace talks and
end a conflict that "has lasted
all too long." And, in reflecting
on the two-year-old Syrian cri-
sis, Francis asked, "How much
suffering must there still be
before a political solution" can
be found?
The pope also expressed
desire for a "spirit of reconcili-
ation" on the Korean peninsula,
where North Korea says it has
entered "a state of war" with
South Korea. He also decried
warfare and terrorism in Afri-
ca, as well as what he called the
21st century's most extensive .
form of slavery: human traf-
ficking.

Two brothers and
their friend learn to
start from scratch
By JAMIE BIRCOLL
For theDaily
There's no shortage of film
expertise among LSA sophomore
Matt Birnholtz, his brother LSA
senior Jordan Birnholtz and Pub-
lic Policy sophomore Matthew
Gold. This group of Hollywood
hopefuls cited no less than 15very
different films, spanning from
1895 to 2012, to explain their take
on the horror genre with their
film, "Meshes of Dusk," which
revolves around a film crew that
goes up to a cabin to shoot a film
(sponsored by a mysterious art
patron). Shooting goes according
to plan until one of the crew dis-
appears.
"Throughout the rest of the
film, it gets very tense, very tight,
and by the end of the movie there's
this very shocking twist," Matt
said.
"Essentially, it's about the mak-
ing of a moviethat goes very badly
awry," Jordan said.
"One ofthe good and badthings
about working with Screen Arts
and Cultures majors ... they're
always asking me, 'Have you seen
this movie, have you seen that
movie,' and just the vast pool of
knowledge of them is just ridicu-
lous," said Gold, the producer of

the film.
That vast amount of knowledge
will only prove useful when Jor-
dan (writer) and Matt Birnholtz
(writer/director), and Matthew
Gold take 20 other University stu-
dents to a cabin in Oscoda, Mich.
this summer to film the bulk of,
whatthey call, their psychological
thriller.
The crew aims for the high-
est degree of professionalism and
independence, despite the lack of
influential connections, which
stands as a point of pride for the
filmmakers.
"It's a crew of students, but it's
not a student film," Matt said.
Matt and Gold had been mak-
ing movies for several years but
feel that this brainchild is their
best yet, and the time has come to
bring it to fruition.
"We really think we have the
right idea," Matt said. "The story
is really an awesome story; it's a
thrill ride. In terms of technical
skills ... I wanted to make sure I
knew enough to make this, and I
feel I'm finally ready asa director.
And I feel we need the right crew
and the right cast, and our crew
is incredible: sound guy, lighting
guy. Everyone is just so ready to
go."
Matt emphasized that "Meshes
of Dusk" seeks to be more than
today's standard gorefest horrors
- it's a film with a message, a cri-
tique of modern social media.
"It's a film about what horror
really is, which is people's emo-

tions getting the best of them in
very tense situations when you're
isolated. I mean, the whole con-
cept of horror is isolate, isolate,
isolate, and in the 21st century
that's nearly impossible to do."
Only through sufficient fund-
ing can these ideas be brought
to the big screen. The group
applied for and won the Screen
Arts and Cultures Department's
Alice Webber Glover Scholarship
Award, which funds students up
to $2000 to aid with special costs
in writing or producing a student-
led project. They also have taken
advantage of the SAC Depart-
ment's allowing majors to rent
much of the necessary equipment
directly from the University, sav-
ing a great deal of money.
The filmmakers hope the rest
of their funding will come from
their Kickstarter, the crowd-
funding website that allows users
to post their project goals online
and hope that an interested public
will donate to get that project up
and running. The team has calcu-
lated a fundraising goal of $4,250.
"We're paying not just for
transportation and equipment,
but for people to eat and subsist
for a month."
According to Gold, costs from
necessities including makeup,
props and a U-Haul truck, as
well as food and equipment, all
accumulate very quickly and sub-
stantially, despite the fact that no
member of the crew is paid.
The three expect the funds to

come from a network rooted in
their close group of friends and
family.
"You're drawing on your
friends, and you're drawing on
your family, and you're draw-
ing on people who just find you
interesting, who are very often
friends of family. That propor-
tion of random people coming
from, say, Uruguay, who are like
surfing the internet, is probably
relatively low," said Jordan, who
has had a past experience fun-
draising but never before for a
movie.
Regardless of how much
money they receive from Kick-
starter, however, the team
guarantees that the film will be
completed, albeit with less room
for comfort and leisure. The
crew demonstrates a great deal
of commitment.
"If it comes down to it, we end
up rationing food, we'll ration
rice and apples. And what's great
is our cast and crew are commit-
ted to this that they won't have
an issue doing that," Gold said.
The filmmakers have an idea
they want to bring to life, and
their dedication might drive
them to success. Every contri-
bution of money, time and ideas,
large or small, goes towards
making a winning film. As he
was putting on his coat at the
end of their interview, Matt
found $5 in his pocket.
"Awesome," Jordan said. "Put
it in the fund."

Learning from the lack of
morality in Tarantino 's movies

By SEAN CZARNECKI
Daily Film Editor
When it comes to the Oscars
and Quentin Tarantino, I've
heard a frequent complaint
levied toward the "Django
Unchained" director: He lacks
depth and insight. They love
him; they love his films; but he's
just not Oscar-worthy. And then
there's the film elitist belief that
because he ignores morality,
he should be discarded. Take
Armond White's quip on Taran-
tino's favorite genre, Spaghetti
Western: "For intellectually lazy
Americans, these films are just
cool, the birth of hipster cyni-
cism."
I am no expert. So, let me
proudly introduce myself as a
simple-minded fool, one of those
"Children throughout the Inter-
net express(ing) pants-wetting
anticipation." Let me tell you,
as purely a moviegoer, no more
or less, why Tarantino will con-
tinue to influence cinema and
how he's taught me to be a better
reader of film.
I believe Tarantino displays
enormous restraint in refusing to
puppeteer a character to present
his own voice, in hijacking per-
spective, in direct commentary.
He strips away morality as he
has intended because it wouldn't
work within the films he crafts.
Imagine a sobby epiphany in
"Kill Bill." Now, imagine one in
"Django" as the titular character
confronts the tyrannical Calvin
Candie.

movies, "Inglourious Basterds"
and "Django Unchained," I
learned something about mean-
ing: The success of those two
films lies in its provocation of
debate.
Tarantino knows that the dia-
logue of film endures beyond the
theater or the car ride home. It
endures in your lunch talks with
friends, in the way we think,
hell, in the way we write. He
places enormous faith in the
intellectual fiber of his audience.
Pretension absent. Preaching
none. It would be wrong to won-
der what he's telling us. It's not
what he thinks; it's what the hell
you think.
As for "Django," he took a
controversial subject people let
die in textbooks, a topic that
normally silences debate, and
produced white-hot noise. And
after 17 years in the business
of making ultraviolent content,
the filmmaker has received his
fair share of ire.
I learned that the aesthetici-
zation of violence is valid. True,
Tarantino has an ear for noise
and verbose wit - a universally
accepted staple of his repertoire
- but he also has an eye for
violence. He has no apologies
for his blood-soaked fantasies,
nor do I have any for watching
them. Violence is a fundamen-
tal component of experiencing
something Tarantinian.
But every once in a while, he

TARANTINO
From Page 7A
One of the things I object
to in Hollywood produc-
tion - the misrepresentation,
even beautification of reality
which I discussed previously
- gives Tarantino fluidity in
his craft. He builds worlds that
can only be realized in cine-
ma, using deep intertextuality
that dwarfs most film-lovers'
(read: my) cinema knowledge to
reflect on American culture.
But I should mention that
there are complicated problems
with Tarantino. "Django" cap-
tures both his artistry and his
irresponsibility, at once crack-
ling with his glee for violence
and controversial language,
and demonstrating his demo-
cratic, eclectic approach to cin-
ema. He clashes low and niche
culture, such as his notable use
of Blaxpoitation, with high and
mainstream art. It's a fierce
aesthetic.
He gave us Hans Landa
(Christoph Waltz), a Nazi fas-
cinated with America, then

casts Waltz as his slave-liber-
ating twin, Dr. King Schultz.
And though the famed director
affectionately follows the con-
ventions of Spaghetti Western
(he is indeed a Spaghetti-West-
ern master), he puts a black
superhero in a white-dominat-
ed genre.
Tarantino clashes culture
together. By doing so, he forc-
es us to question what license
storytellers should have when
it comes to painful histories,
and he makes slavery present
in a way otherwise impossible.
Because what separates the
past from the present is never
constant, they can sometines
be unified. I saw a revenge
fantasy, "Django," break that
boundary and show us how
slavery is relevant to our cul-
ture, even today.
And therein lies the last les-
son: American culture reveals
its constraints in its refusal to
confront the shameful chapters
of our history. I cannot condemn
a tradition out of reasons of per-
sonal taste, for those parts of
our culture we shun and silence
just may be our most important.

Shallow'Love and Honor

Ann Arbor-set
romance tries
too hard
By NATALIE GADBOIS
Daily Arts Writer
"Love and Honor" is a Nicholas
Sparks book masquerading as a
political commentary. Directedby
newcomer and
Michigan alum
Danny Mooney
and set in the Love and
hazy counter- Honor
culture that was
1969 Ann Arbor, At the
the film claims Michigan
to be a state- FC
ment about the
ambiguity of
political activism, but instead is
a pretty, empty caricature of the
time period. "Love and Honor"
doesn't seem to understand what
it is - a tender romance, a com-

edy of errors, a satire of activism
or a denouncement of war - and
spends an hour and 45 minutes
never getting there.
Mickey Wright (Liam Hem-
sworth, "The Hunger Games")
is a soldier whose vapid charm
and clean-cut good looks are
disconcerting in the despair
that is war-torn Vietnam. When
his dependable best friend, Dal-
ton (Austin Stowell, "Dolphin
Tale"), is abruptlydumped byhis
high-school sweetheart, Mickey
follows him back to Ann Arbor
on their week-long leave; Dalton
with the purpose of reconciling
with his love, and Mickey off to
chase tail. Both these characters
are Ken dolls, each definable by
one consuming characteristic
(Dalton's loyalty; Mickey's libi-
do), and once in hippie-dippy
Ann Arbor, their strong jaws and
army uniforms give the impres-
sion of frat boys dressing up like
G.I. Joe.
In an attempt to curry favor

with feisty left-wing Candace
(Teresa Palmer, "Warm Bod-
ies"), Mickey pretends that he
and Dalton are army desert-
ers instead of just soldiers on
leave for a week, sick and tired
of fighting a pointless war. This
is where Mooney attempts and
fails to stab at the political cli-
mate of 1969. Ann Arbor is,
and has always been, a liberal
mecca, but the portrayal of the
counterculture is stylized and
it barely touches the surface of
the conflicted furor the war in
Vietnam instigated. It's safe to
assume that political activists in
the 1970s didn't spend their days
wearing precisely mismatched
peasant tops as they swayed to
ukulele players outside Ulrich's,
but that's how the film portrays
their lifestyles.
Similarly, phrases and pick-
up lines that no one would ever
say fill the script. (No 20-year-
old has ever successfully picked
up two stewardesses by calling

them "the loveliest angels" and
winking. It just doesn't hap-
pen.) The romantic scenes are
laughably bland and lackluster,
and none of the relationships
have any chemistry. The actors
only function as mannequins for
groovy costumes, just as the city
of Ann Arbor is only a backdrop
for an idealized image of sum-
mer 1969. The characters all lack
dynamism, and any smidgen of
relatability is lost in the awful
writing, which makes everyone
come off as either a righteous
jerk or a brainless druggie.
Films are meant to entertain
- they don't have to be gritty,
exacting representations of real
life. But to relate, they must
contain some real human truth,
something that ties the audi-
ence in beyond the pretty people
and idyllic landscape. "Love and
Honor" never finds this nugget
of truth, and instead aimlessly
avoids difficult issues and com-
plex relationships.

The Michigan men's swimming team
won its 12th national championship on
Saturday.

The Michigan sports year started with
a crushing loss at Cowboys Stadium and
should've ended there too, writes Stephen
J. Nesbitt.


2B - Aprill1, 2013

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

At Cowboys Stadium, the ending that didn't come

t was supposed to end here.
The script was all lined
up, the pen readied to ink a
rather proper and realistic ending
to this season. Everyone loves a
circular narrative structure, and
this script even had those book-
ends right.
What first appeared a dream
Michigan year seemed destined
to end in one way: early, decisively
and painfully. The whole year had
felt that way.
The year,
you see,
started seven
months ago,
when, as stu-
dents arrived
on campus in
Ann Arbor,
the Michigan
football team STEPHEN J.
walked into NESBITT
the palatial
Cowboys
Stadium on Sept.1 for the season
opener against Southeastern Con-
ference powerhouse Alabama, the
eventual national champion.
Any overenthusiastic hopes of
a Michigan football champion-
ship were blown to bits right then
and there. And things didn't get
easier during the second semester,
either. The men's basketball team,
which entered the season with
everybit of hype and hoopla, fell
from as high asa No. 1 ranking,
lost a grip on the regular-season
Big Ten title and was bounced by
Wisconsin in the second round of
the conference tournament. Even
the hockey team, enduring its
worst season in over two decades,
collapsed this year - it nearly
made a historic run before it was
stopped a game short of extend-
ing its record streak of 22 NCAA
Tournament appearances.
Every ending this year: early,
decisive and painful.
All hopes for ahappy ending

hitched on the Big Dance.
The narrative said that the
year was supposed to end this
weekend, back in that exact same
venue it began in - Cowboys Sta-
dium - and against another SEC
power, Florida, this time. Well,
that's if the Wolverines even got
that far - they were supposed to
fall to Kansas, but fate somehow
tilted back in Michigan's favor in
the final moments.
Sure, the Wolverines had a
wealth of talent, but they came
wounded into the NCAA Tourna-
ment. They'd never hold together.
They were underdogs and lower
seeds againstboth one-seed
Kansas in the Sweet Sixteen and
third-seeded Florida in the Elite
Eight. Few realistically expected
them to survive the South Region.
It was supposed to end at Cow-
boys Stadium.
S-E-C, S-E-C, S-E-C
The chant started in the north-
west corner of Cowboys Stadium;
it spread rapidly through the
crowd of 90,413 until nearly every
crimson-clad fan was on his or
her feet. The chorus grew louder
and louder as the final seconds
ticked off the clock in Arlington,
Texas.
A season that held so much
promise, with Michigan coming
off a BCS bowl appearance and
with Denard Robinson at the
helm for one final season, began
with a face-washing: Alabama 41,
Michigan 14.
Juwan Howard watched from
field level. He, too, had hoped the
Wolverines could shock Alabama,
shock the world like he and the
Fab Five had proclaimed two
decades earlier. But he could only
shake his head at the outcome.
Howard didn't know Michigan
would be back seven months later,

playing a different sport this time.
He didn't know the Wolverines
would be fighting for their first
Final Four berth since the Fab
Five. He didn't know a different
Michigan team would shock the
world.
The parallels between the two
events - the beginning and the
supposed end - are striking. But
the opposites are even more so.
The seasonbegan with redshirt
junior left tackle Taylor Lewan,
flanked by a trainer, limping his
way off the painted turf and up
the tunnel at Cowboys Stadium.
He was hurt, insulted, defeated.
The season wasn't expected
to extend past this weekend
despite the everydaybrilliance of
sophomore guard Trey Burke. He
couldn't carrythe team alone, but
he'd been expected to do just that
all year. He, like Lewan, wasn't
himself. Burke battled a flu virus
in the Elite Eight, and as the clock
hit zeros, he lay on his back on the
court, exhausted. But then he was
picked up and lifted into the airby
freshman forward Mitch McGary.
They were hurt, at times insulted,
but not yet defeated.
Seven months ago, Michigan
athletic director Dave Brandon
followed Lewan up the tunnel
with his head bowed. But on Sun-
day, he beamed, shook Michigan
coach John Beilein's hand and
embraced everyone he could find
in front of the Wolverines' bench.
Seven months ago, the football
team lost 41-14, but on Sunday the
basketball team led 41-17 with
four minutes remaining in the
first half
And seven months ago, an
S-E-C chant rained down inside
Cowboys Stadium, but on Sunday
there was a different ring.
IT'S GREAT-

Sophomore guard Trey Burke saved Michigan tram ao esit io the Sweetl16 with a 30-last 3-painter at the enoa regulation.

It started softly.

The chant began to rise above
the cheers, buffeting the air inside
the House that Jerry Built.
A MICHIGAN WOLVERINE
This wasn't the sound they
expected in Arlington. Ovations
instead of tears. Victory instead
of defeat. A beginning instead of
an ending.
The Michigan men's basketball
team was never actually supposed
to reach the Final Four. The Wol-
verines weren't that good, right?
But, fueled primarily by a mot-
ley crew of underclassmen and
a superstar sophomore, they are
that good. And now they're on to
Atlanta and the program's first
Final Four appearance since 1993,
when most of the freshman class
wasn't even born.
It was supposed to end here.
But the end of this season, this
year, is yet to come.

A Nik Stauskas kind of day

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
After his first shot in warm-
ups, Nik Stauskas knew it was
goingto be a good shooting day.
Maybe the rest of the arena,
and the rest of the Michigan
men's basketball team didn't
know it, but the freshman guard.
did. By his standards, Stauskas
- the Wolverines' sharpshoot-
er - had been in a funk from
beyond the 3-point line, strug-
gling to find the form that had
him ascend from sixth man off
the bench to one of the best pure
shooters in the country.
In the earlier rounds of the
NCAA Tournament, Stauskas's
shots from deep looked flat. They
took hard bounces off the rim -
the soft, floating touch wasn't
there.
So on Sunday, Stauskas felt
what nobody else could've pre-
dicted because his shots in
warm-ups felt like his shots from
the beginning of the season. The
freshman knew he was in for
a big game, and it showed. He
scored a game-high 22 points and
didn't miss a shot on six attempts
from downtown, carrying Mich-
igan to a 79-59 win over Florida
to advance to the Final Four.
"I was calling it for the last
week - I was due for one of these
games," Stauskas said. "It's been
a while. ... My jumper felt real
good so I just let it fly."
For the majority of the first
half, it looked like Florida had
forgotten to scout the sharp-

shooting Stauskas. While Michi-
gan (12-6 Big Ten, 30-7 overall)
moved the ball around on offense
and in transition, Stauskas was
left open in the corner. Last
week, there was a good chance
he didn't connect on the open
attempts.
But on Sunday, he made the
Gators pay. Time after time,
Stauskas calmly sunk the open
looks from the corner, as he fin-
ished the first half with 19 points,
including five 3-pointers.
As has been the case for
most of the season, making the
first shot was key for Stauskas.
Known for his antics after mak-
ing big shots but also for strug-
gling late in games if his first
few attempts don't go in, a clean
swoosh on his first made 3-point
attempt proved crucial.
"Every time Nik makes that
first three, we call it popping off,"
said junior guard Tim Hardaway
Jr. "Nik gets excited and puts on
the goggles and everything. Once
he gets like-that, you can call it
quits."
After his third made 3-point
attempt - again, from the corner
- Stauskas went crazy, running
down the court, smiling and wag-
ging his tongue. The last time he
had shot more than 50 percent
from deep was in the beginning
of February against Ohio State,
which would be acceptable for
any Wolverine except for Staus-
kas.
On Saturday, he became the
first player in an NCAA Regional
final to finish 6-for-6 on 3-point-

"You know, I'm not going to

Nearly 30 years later, Syra-

Beilein recalled listening to the
radio call of Villanova winning

he'd reach.
"Absolutely not. I dreamed

In his first year at Michigan,
the 2007-08 campaign, a Final

two of three in

against Minnesota

The first-base umpire sig-
naled sophomore left fielder
Zach Zott out after Minnesota
pitcher DJ Snelten barely beat
him to first base for the final out
of the Michigan baseball team's
Saturday doubleheader.
At that moment, everyone in
the Michigan dugout knew the
team had squandered an oppor-
tunity to make a statement in
the first series of conference
play.
Despite MINNESOTA 3

that led to
an 11-3 victory over the Golden
Gophers (2-1 Big Ten, 17-12 over-
all), the Wolverines received lit-
tle offensive output in the other
two games of the series, losing
3-1 on Friday and 2-1 in the sec-
ond game Saturday.
"Hitting is contagious," said
Michigan coach Erik Bakich.
"Sometimes you string a bunch
of quality at-bats together, and
you get four or five hits in a row
and everything seems to fall
your way, and then other times
they don't."
On Friday, the latter hap-
pened as the Wolverines (1-2,
11-14) rarely got the ball in play
against Minnesota ace Tom
Windle. Windle recorded 13
strikeouts while allowing just
four hits and one run in his
fourth complete game of the
season.
Michigan's lone run of the
game came in the third inning
when freshman shortstop Tra-
vis Maezes's RBI groundout
scored freshman first baseman
Jack Sexton.
The lack of production in Sat-
urday's second game was even
more frustrating for the Wol-
verines because Minnesota's
starter Alec Crawford had a5.40
earned-run average entering the
game in his two starts on the
season. Crawford allowed one

unearned run and just four hits
in 5.1 innings. Michigan's only
run came in the second inning
as Zott scored after a throw-
ing error on Minnesota catcher
Matt Halloran as Zott he stole
third.
But sophomore left-hander
Trent Szkutnik kept the Wol-
verines in the game, giving up
two earned runs in 6.2 innings.
The strong start capped off a
consistent weekend of starting
pitching for Michigan, with the
Wolverine starters allowing just
four earned runs on the week-
end.
"(They were) throwing
strikes," said Michigan junior
catcher Cole Martin, "pounding
the strike zone."
Szkutnik's start, followed by
shutdown relief pitching from
senior right-hander Kyle Clark
and freshman right-hander
Jacob Cronenworth gave the
Wolverines an opportunity
to tie the game in the ninth
inning. After Maezes started
off the inning by grounding out
to second, Cronenworth sin-
gled to right field. Bakich then
inserted senior center fielder
Patrick Biondi - who hasn't
started in three weeks with a
sprained thumb - to pinch run
for Cronenworth. After a wild

pitch and a sacrifice fly, Biondi
reached third with two outs. But
that was the farthest he would
get as Snelten barely beat Zott
to first after he hita short infield
chopper.
The first game on Saturday
was a completely different game
for the Wolverines, as seem-
ingly nothing could go wrong.
Freshman left-hander Evan Hill
pitched seven innings, allowing
only one earned run while strik-
ing out five.
The offense also played its
role, led by Martin from the bot-
tom of the lineup. Though he has
struggled at the plate for much
of the season, Martin had three
hits, including his first career
home run, a solo shot to right.
His three RBI led the team,
but he was far from the only
Michigan player to produce
with the team collecting 16 hits
in the rout.
"I've hit a lot of balls right at
people all year," Martin said.
"The baseball gods kind of
repaid me a little bit."
With the opportunity to win
its first series in the Big Ten
squandered, the Wolverines will
look ahead and hope that future
wins won't depend on a run-
ner beating out a ball hit in the
infield.

For pitching staff, discouraging
answers in disappointing weekend

Students offered
$40 Final Four tix

By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Writer
Heading into this weekend's
series against Minnesota, the
Michigan baseball team had sev-
eral questions surrounding its
pitching staff.
The most basic of those ques-
tions was who would step up
alongside fresh-
man left-hander NOTEBOOK
Evan Hill in the
weekend rotation. Hill leads the
team in ERA (2.06), wins (four)
and innings pitched (43.2).
Fortunately for Michigan
coach Erik Bakich, he received
some much-needed answers
from junior left-hander Logan
McAnallen and sophomore left-
hander Trent Szkutnik, who both
earned the starting job for the
Minnesota series.
Bakich said he went with an all
left-handed rotation to counter
Minnesota's several left-handed
batters and in an attempt to con-
trol the Gophers' running game.
And it worked out in his favor,
as McAnallen allowed only one
earned run off four hits and
fanned six batters in 5.1 innings.
Szkutnik also flashed glimpses
of why he should stay in the rota-
tion, allowing just two earned
runs after scattering nine hits in
6.2 innings. Despite Szkutnik's
best start of the year, Bakich men-
tioned that only McAnallen will

be a sure bet to stay alongside Hill
in the rotation next weekend.
But McAnallen securing that
second spot is a step forward in
solving Michigan's lasting pitch-
ing dilemma.
(ALMOST) SLIPPING OUT OF
A FUNK: Coming into the Min-
nesota series, the Wolverines
had scored a paltry 22 runs in
seven games. But in the opening
game of Saturday's doubleheader,
Michigan exploded for 11 runs to
seemingly mark the end of a two-
week-long offensive rut. Unfor-
tunately for the Wolverines, that
wasn't the case, as they managed
to touch home plate just once in
the latter half of the doublehead-
er.
Michigan's 11-run, 16-hit per-
formance matched a season high
in both offensive categories, and
showcased a preview of what the
offense is capable of when firing
on all cylinders. The Wolverines
scored in every inning from the
third on, mixing in an impressive
display of fighting off pitches for
opposite-field singles along with
plenty of extra-base hits.
Friday's game was reminiscent
of the previous seven games that
saw the offense struggle, but to
be fair not many teams could hit
the stuff that Minnesota's starter,
left-hander Tom Windle, was
featuring. He threw a complete
game, allowing just one earned
run off four hits as he struck out

13 Wolverines along the way.
On Saturday, the Wolverines
simply couldn't carry over the
offensive success from game one
to game two, as they failed to
advance runners in scoring posi-
tion several times. The last game
of this weekend's series ended
eerily similar to the previous
weekend's finale.
With a runner on third and
two outs, sophomore left-fielder
Zach Zott failed to get the tying
run across the plate, just as junior
right-fielder Michael O'Neill
wasn't able to do so last weekend
against Western Illinois.
A bit more consistency at the
plate, along with clutch hitting,
will be the recipe for finally dig-
ging out of the offensive slump
that has plagued the Wolverines
lately.
BIONDI'S IMPROVEMENT:
Senior center fielder Patrick Bion-
di has been out of the lineup with
a left thumb injury for the past
three weeks, but Bakich has used
him sparingly as a pinch-runner.
Against Minnesota, Biondi made
his first appearance on defense
since March 10 at San Diego, and
he failed to disappoint.
Just as he replaced sophomore
Kyle Jusick at center field in the
eighth inning, Biondi made a run-
ning catch to record the second
out. It's pretty routine for Biondi
to run down incoming fly balls,
but this time Biondi wasn't wear-

ing his glove on his left hand like
he usually does. Due to the inju-
ry, he wore his glove on his right
hand to avoid further harming
his left thumb, but that change
hardly affected Michigan's cap-
tain.
While the timetable is still
uncertain for Biondi's return to
the lineup, an outstanding catch
with his off-hand in his first
defensive appearance in weeks
has the Wolverines hopeful.
"As soon as the good Lord will
allow it to happen, he's gonna be
in there," Bakich said. "We cer-
tainly need him back in there,
that's for sure."

The Michigan men's swimming team earned its first national championship since 1995. Junior Connor Jaeger won national titles in two different events; the 1,650-yard freestyle and the 500-yard freestyle, becoming the fifth Wolverine ever to win the event.

With the NCAA title finally in
hand, it was time for Michigan
head coach Mike Bottom to have
some fun of his own. Adorned in a
plaid maize-and-blue shirt, a blue
tie emblazoned with Wolverines
and dark brown pants, Bottom
leaped off the starting blocks and
into the diving pool, joining the
celebration of the newly crowned
Michigan men's swimming team.
"It's definitely time to cel-
ebrate," Bottom said. "This team
has worked hard all year at every
meet and has swam fast since they
got off on the block. They swam
fast all throughout the season,
and they got here and kept swim-
ming fast."

The meet spanned from Thurs-
day to Saturday at IU Natatorium
in Indianapolis - the exact loca-
tion the Wolverines won their last
title in 1995.
"We have a lot of great alumni
that have sent me pictures of them
swimming around in that pool,"
Bottom said, with a chuckle, in
his press conference. "And we put
some of those pictures up and had
some of them come in and talk to
us about that feeling."
With preparation, poise and
perhaps a little luck, the Wolver-
ines were ready to make their run
at a title.
The quartet of sophomore
Bruno Ortiz, graduate student
Zachary Turke, and seniors Sean
Fletcher and Miguel Ortiz got
Michigan its first points of the
meet, placing third in the 200-
yard freestyle relay. The Wolver-
ines would finish the night with
another third-place finish in the
400-yard medley relay event, as
the quartet of Miguel Ortiz, soph-
omore Richard Funk, Fletcher,
and Bruno Ortiz clocked in at

3:04.73, setting a school record.
Michigan's only win of the day
came by way of junior Connor
Jaeger in the 500-yard freestyle,
who became the fifth Wolverine
ever to win the event. Jaeger had
won the event outright for Michi-
ganthroughout the season, usual-
ly leading the race right from the
start. His record looked to be in
danger though, as Texas' Michael
McBroom wouldn't allow Jaeger
any separation. At the 150-yard
mark, Jaeger finally made his
move, holding off McBroom for
the event win, helping Michigan
take the day one lead with 153
points.
The second day followed a
similar script, with the Wolver-
ines' relay teams making head-
lines. In the first event final of
the night, the quartet of Miguel
Ortiz, Bruno Ortiz, Fletcher and
Turke took first-place in the 200-
yard medley relay with a time of
1:22.27, setting new NCAA, U.S.
Open, NCAA Championship and
school records. The win also
marked the first time a Michigan

relay team has ever won a nation-
al title in the NCAA Champion-
ship's 76-year history.
"We started out with one
recruiting class that we were
scrambling with because we came
in late," Bottom said at his press
conference. "And these are the
guys, you know, we had four of
them on that relay that broke the
national record and it's awesome
to see."
The Wolverines also received
significant contributions from
Fletcher and Funk, both placing
third in the 100-yard butterfly and
100-yard breaststroke, respec-
tively. With a second-place finish
in the 800-yard freestyle relay,
the team of junior Michael Wyn-
alda, Jaeger, freshman Anders
Nielsen and redshirt junior Has-
saan Khalik helped Michigan end
the night in first place with 336
points.
"We didn't have a real confi-
dence that we would win this,"
Bottom said to ESPN on March
30. "By the second day, I looked
at our team and I said, 'Alright,

we've gotten in the top three, now
what do you want to do?' They
looked at me like I was crazy.
They looked at me and said, 'We
came here to win."'
And with Jaeger's first-place
finish in the 1,650-yard freestyle,
Michigan inched ever closer to.
a national championship. With
the event win, Jaeger became the
first swimmer for Michigan to
win two individual events since
Tyler Clary - a gold medalist in
this summer's Olympics - accom-
plished the feat in 2009.
And surely enough, the Wol-
verines rounded out the event
with a second-place finish in
yet another relay. With a time
of 2:50.18, Miguel Ortiz, Turke,
Fletcher and Bruno Ortiz ensured
Michigan 34 points and a Nation-
al Championship.
"We never took our eyes off
the big show, but we went into
every meet and we wanted to win,
and we swam fast all year: swam
fast in dual meets, swam fast in
conference and we kept getting
better," Jaeger said. "We kept

believing, we kept following the
program we have set, and this is a
team fueled by passion.... Passion
for Michigan."
The title marks the 12th in the
history of Michigan swimming
and diving, but perhaps more
importantly, its recent triumph
breaks a tie between the Wolver-
ines and Buckeyes for the most
all-time championships. And to
top it all off, coach Bottom was
named Coach of the Year at the
culmination of the meet.
At the end, with his players still
celebrating in the pool, Bottom
sat alone on the side of the pool,
finally taking it all in.
The Wolverines finished the
season with an 8-0 overall and
6-0 Big Ten record, but Bottom
said the team needed to push
on for Big Ten Championships.
When Michigan won its third
straight Big Ten Championship,G
Bottom said the team needed to
keep swimming fast for NCAAs.
But now, with a NCAA title under
his belt, Bottom is finally ready to
celebrate.
