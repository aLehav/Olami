Race has been one of, if not 

the defining faultline at the 
University of Michigan. In 
the last five years, a slew of 
fatal police shootings of Black 
Americans 
coincided 
with 

a spike in anti-Black attacks 
at the University and in Ann 
Arbor. 
Protests 
engulfed 

campus 
following 
nearly 

every incident, and students 
organized movements spanning 
from #BBUM to Ann Arbor to 
Ferguson, Mo. to #StopSpencer.

Leading from behind each 

of these moments has been 
postdoctoral 
fellow 
Austin 

McCoy. 
McCoy 
arrived 
on 

campus in 2009 as a History 
Ph.D. student, and nearly a 
decade later, has become a 
hybrid 
adviser-activist 
to 

hundreds of student organizers. 
After completing a dissertation 
on the history of progressive 
organizing, he’s leaving Ann 
Arbor for Alabama, where he’ll 

be taking up a new post as a 
history professor at Auburn 
University. The Daily sat down 
with McCoy to reflect on his 
time on campus, and what’s up 
next.

TMD: So nine years later, 

how does it feel to be leaving?

McCoy: It feels weird … Ann 

Arbor is the second longest 
place I’ve lived. But it also feels 
like it’s the right time to go do 
something different.

TMD: You chose Auburn 

University, which is definitely 
warmer! But it’s also in the 
South, which is a new kind of 
forum for your work.

McCoy: I had a choice 

between there and a school 
in the Northeast and I chose 
Auburn. Part of it is I really 
like the department, I like the 
people, and I thought I would 
be able to have a big impact 
on students there — and even 
in politics possibly within the 
state. It’s the South. Auburn 
isn’t going to be like Ann Arbor; 
it’ll be less liberal and the 

Campus Mind Works, a wellness 

group that promotes mental health 
education and provides support 
groups through the University 
of Michigan Depression Center, 
spoke Tuesday night on the 
potentially harmful effects of a 
world increasingly dependent on 
technology.

This seminar, held in partnership 

with the College of Engineering 
and the Newnan LSA Academic 
Advising Center, was run by clinical 
staff affiliated with the University’s 
Department of Psychiatry. They 
provided 
information 
about 

practicing self-care in a digital 
world while allowing students to 
connect with others who may have 
shared similar experiences.

This seminar’s topic revolved 

around the harmful side effects 
of technology and not only how 
to combat these effects but how 
to limit and moderate the use of 

The 
National 
Center 
for 

Institutional Diversity hosted a 
discussion titled “Campus Inclusion 
and Free Expression: A Conversation 
with Higher Education Leaders” 
Tuesday night at the Graduate hotel 
in Ann Arbor. Tabbye Chavous, 
University of Michigan professor and 
director of the National Center for 
Institutional Diversity, moderated 
a four-person panel of university 
administrators 
as 
they 
debated 

the challenge of making campuses 
welcoming 
and 
inclusive 
while 

upholding the right to free speech.

About 50 audience members, 

including administrators and faculty 
from universities across the country, 
attended the event, which was the 
third in a series of dialogues that have 
taken place at various universities 
over the past academic year. 

After 
panelists 
introduced 

themselves, 
Chavous 
began 
by 

asking them to comment on the clash 
between free speech and inclusion, 
and to consider how the two ideas are 
often pitted against one another on 
college campuses.

Lorelle 
Espinosa, 
American 

Council of Education’s assistant vice 
president of the Center for Policy 
Research and Strategy, brought up 

a 2018 Gallup-Knight Foundation 
report, which found that students 
value inclusion over free speech.

John 
DeGioia, 
president 
of 

Georgetown 
University, 
also 

responded, suggesting the study 
didn’t capture the nuance of the 
issue. Though the results made 
headlines, the margin was small — 
only 53 percent of students chose 
diversity and inclusion over free 
speech — and, according to DeGioia, 

placing inclusion and free speech 
in direct competition is inherently 
problematic. 
DeGioia 
said 
that 

university administrators need to 
understand the complexity of free 
speech.

“We’re in a new moment in higher 

education where we’ve achieved a 
level of diversity across our campuses 
that requires a different kind of 
leadership, a different kind of 
engagement that respects the 

sheer newness of what we’re now 
wrestling with,” DeGioia said.

Chavous then invited the panel 

to think of how the country’s 
political climate has exacerbated 
issues 
of 
self-expression 
in 

academia. She cited a recent 
study from the Anti-Defamation 
League reporting a spike in 
white supremacist propaganda 
on college campuses, and asked 

On Tuesday, the University 

of 
Michigan 
released 
its 

Sustainability Progress Report, 
which provides data on the 
University’s progress toward 
its 
campus 
sustainability 

goals for 2025. The report 
includes updates within the 
categories of climate action, 
waste 
prevention, 
healthy 

environments and community 
engagement.

In the area of climate action, 

the University has reduced 
greenhouse gas emissions by 
5 percent and hopes to cut 
emissions by 25 percent by 
2025. The University has also 
cut vehicle carbon output by 
15 percent, halfway toward its 
goal of 30 percent by 2025.

Prominent campus leader talks activism,

RIYAH BASHA
Daily News Editor

Students expressed concerns they are unaware of exactly where tuition is being spent 

For 
LSA 
senior 
Madeleine 

Conrad, an out-of-state student 
from California, the differences 
in enrollment numbers between 
in-state and out-of-state students 
at the University of Michigan 
reflect the diverse perspectives 

brought by out-of-state students. 
Yet Conrad feels conflicted when 
she considers the role she feels 
the University should play in 
supporting in-state students.

“When you’re talking about 

diversity 
and 
perspective, 

obviously being in-state versus 
out-of-state is part of that,” 
Conrad said. “When you bring 
people from out-of-state, you bring 

people from, hopefully, different 
socioeconomic statuses, different 
communities. I think there is 
something to be said to that, to 
kind of value this perspective, 
(but) when considering the greater 
context this University has and 
should stand there for the people 
of Michigan.”

As a public flagship university, 

the University of Michigan was 

established 
upon 
principles 

representing the state — as well 
as an emphasis on providing 
education for in-state students 
who

the panel how institutions should 
address such problems without 
alienating students or faculty.

The speakers commented on the 

role of administration in responding 
to discriminatory actions. DeGioia 
stated universities cannot use the 
protection of the First Amendment 
as justification for remaining silent 
on hateful behavior. Espinosa 
agreed, saying universities can 
implement 
strategies 
such 
as 

counterprogramming, 
which 

is the scheduling of alternative 
activities for students during other, 
potentially upsetting events on 
campus. She said administrations 
need to be proactive and anticipate 
speech 
and 
identity-related 

conflicts.

“We’ve all been in such a 

reactive state over these last few 

years,” 
Espinosa 
said. 
“We’re 

trying to really hone in on what it 
means to be ready, and that really 
does come down, in a lot of ways, to 
institutional policy on a whole host 
of levels.”

Kevin 
McDonald, 
chief 

diversity officer and interim 
vice chancellor for Inclusion, 
Diversity and Equity at the 
University 
of 
Missouri, 

contributed to the panel by 
sharing an example initiative at 
the University of Missouri. The 
university uses music to create 
safe spaces in which students 
can discuss their experiences 
with discrimination and racial 
identity. McDonald also noted 
students have been instrumental 
in creating conversation about 
hate speech on the University of 
Missouri campus.

“It’s students who say, ‘No, 

this is the reality of the world 
we live in, this is what is shaping 
our national and global context, 
and we need to be aware of that 

and have hard conversations,’” 
McDonald said.

Continuing on the subject of 

hate speech and propaganda, 
the panelists discussed how 
many 
universities 
emphasize 

the 
importance 
of 
valuing 

“diverse 
perspectives,” 
but 

issues arise when those “diverse 
perspectives” are discriminatory 
or 
even 
challenge 
certain 

students’ humanity.

Panelist 
Sanford 
Ungar, 

director of Georgetown’s Free 
Speech Project, brought up white 
supremacist Richard Spencer, 
whose visits to college campuses 
have inspired multiple protests 
and who only recently suspended 
his college tours. Ungar said 
though speakers like Spencer do 
have First Amendment rights, 
universities are morally obliged 
to condemn hate speech.

“I’m just so troubled by this 

notion that a certain purist 
interpretation 
would 
say 

everyone must sit and listen to 

Richard Spencer and engage 
his ideas, as if there were no 
line, no limit, no anything,” 
Ungar 
said. 
“We 
have 
a 

responsibility to tell him that 
yes, of course, you have free 
speech rights, but we have 
a right to confront you and 
to tell you how heinous your 
ideas are.”

Lastly, Chavous asked the 

panelists for their thoughts on 
social media and its role in the 
debate on diversity, inclusion 
and free speech.

Chavous said social media 

can be problematic because 
institutions 
can’t 
regulate 

what students post online, 
but students who experience 
discrimination 
over 
social 

media may still associate the 
negativity with their college 
or university.

The panelists raised some 

of the other issues with social 
media, such as the fact that 
it 
often 
amplifies 
hurtful 

speech. Still, the panelists 
agreed 
social 
media 
does 

have the potential to provide 
a 
platform 
for 
productive 

community dialogue.

After about an hour of panel 

comments, the discussion was 
opened to the audience. Several 
university administrators asked 
questions of the panel. Meredith 
Raimondo, Dean of Students 
at Oberlin College, asked the 
panel how universities should 
respond to microaggressions 
and 
discriminatory 
actions 

which are below the threshold 
of formal discrimination or 
hate speech, but still harm 
students.

DeGioia said the Georgetown 

University administration is 
currently considering ways to 
match its harassment policies 
with 
hate 
speech 
policies. 

Historically, 
DeGioia 
said, 

the two have not been linked, 
but the administration wants 
to 
discuss 
a 
protocol 
for 

responding to more nuanced 
instances of harassment.

Suzanne 
Goldberg, 
an 

administrator and law school 
professor 
from 
Columbia 

University, asked the panel 
what classroom initiatives have 
been effective in addressing 
diversity 
and 
inclusion 
on 

college campuses. McDonald 
gave an example from the 
University of Missouri, where 
he spearheaded an initiative 
offering 
faculty 
$1,000 

stipends in exchange for their 
participation in a year-long 
professional 
development 

program centered on inclusion. 
According to McDonald, the 
administration was “floored” 
by faculty response.

A final question was posed by 

G. Christine Taylor, University 
of Alabama administrator, who 
asked the panelists what kind 
of actions universities can take 
to address discrimination on 
the interpersonal level. She said 
students have reported feeling 
deeply affected by small-scale 
aggressions that accumulate 
over time.

It is Wednesday, and there 

will be at least three University 
of 
Michigan 
graduates 

wearing 
pink. 
Ashley 
Park, 

Taylor Louderman and Erika 
Henningsen, all graduates from 
the School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance, are starring in the 
Broadway musical adaptation 
of the hit 2004 teenage comedy 

“Mean Girls.”

Louderman 
was 
cast 
as 

Regina George, the leader of 
the popular girl group known 
as “The Plastics.” She is joined 
onstage 
by 
loyal 
sidekick 

Gretchen Weiner played by Park. 
When “The Plastics” welcome 
new 
student 
Cady 
Stanton, 

played by Henningsen, a plot of 
gossip, blackmailing and high 
school antics ensue.

“Mean Girls” is not the first 

time any of these leading ladies 

have 
performed 
underneath 

the lights of Broadway. Park 
has starred in three shows 
on Broadway, most recently 
appearing in “Sunday in the 
Park with George” alongside 
Jack Gyllenhaal. Louderman’s 
Broadway 
credits 
include 

“Kinky Boots” and “Bring it 
On: The Musical.” Henningsen 
previously appeared in “Les 
Miserables” as Fantine.

The show premiered Sunday 

night at the August Wilson 

Theater in New York City 
after a two-month trial run in 
Washington, D.C. Tina Fey, 
who penned the iconic lines of 
the film version, also wrote the 
script for the musical. 

As Park, Henningsen and 

Louderman lead the cast of 
“Mean Girls” into the summer 
months, they will be making 
“fetch happen” and furthering 
the legacy of the “Michigan 
Mafia” on Broadway.

Fleming, Blacks Agree to 

Talks 

Demonstrators List Griev-

ances: Others March to Support 
Action 

By Marcia Abramson 
More than 100 black students 

yesterday locked the minis-
tration Bldg. from inside and 
refused entry for nearly five 
hours. The lockout ended when 
University President Robben W. 
Fleming met with the students 
and agreed to discuss their 

grievances next Monday. 

The students demands were 

duplicated and distributed to 
passers-by. They called for: 

Immediate appointment of a 

black man as assistant director 
of admissions.

Appointment of black men to 

the athletic staff. 

A Martin Luther King Schol-

arship fund and an endowed 
chair to be filled by a black 
man. 

Immediate implementa-

tion of the suggestions of the 
Defense Department Greene 
report, which labeled the 
University a place for “rich, 
white students” and called 
for measures to ensure more 
employment of black and non-
academic and academic staff. 

“University activity in the 

community” 

The statement did not 

elaborate on what was meant by 
“University activity.” 

The grievances concluded, 

“We the black students of this 
University do believe that un-
less these grievances are met, 
we will continue to live in a 
basically racist university. Im-
mediate restitution is necessary. 

The students entered the 

building at 7:15 a.m. and se-
cured all the doors with chains 
before most of the office and 
administrative staff arrived. 

Only Fleming and Dr. ALbert 
H. Wheeler, chairman of the 
Michigan NAACP, were allowed 
inside. The students left shortly 
after noon. 

A picket line of white stu-

dents began forming around 
8:30 a.m. in support of the 
protest. Some 20 or 30 students 
carried signs reading “Sup-
port Our Black Brothers” and 
“Ann Arbor- All-American City 
for All.” Supporters collected 
enough money to buy the pro-
testers’ lunch which was passed 
through a briefly unchained 
door. 

Fleming termed the demands 

“very reasonable and construc-
tive proposals” in a general 
statement.

freshmen hailed from in-state 
in the fall of 2017. This is an 8% 
drop from in-state freshmen 
enrollment in the fall of 2013. 
The decision of whether to 
pursue more national enrollment 
or continue emphasizing in-state 
enrollment remains an issue for 
public universities across the 
country, as the article reports 
11 flagship universities that had 
incoming freshman classes in 
2016 with over half of students 
being out-of-state.

Kedra Ishop, vice provost 

for Enrollment Management, 
explained in an email interview 
that the Office of Enrollment 
Management works to keep a 
majority in-state freshman class 
while also representing interests 
coming from the national and 
international scene.

Ishop 
stated 
high 
school 

populations in the state of 
Michigan are declining, and, 
likewise, the number of in-state 
applications remain lower than 
those from out-of-state students, 
with one-third of applicants 
coming from in-state and two-
thirds from out-of-state. She 
explained 
applications 
have 

increased 120 percent since 
2010, with a record number of 
applications in 2017. Yet the 
number of students admitted 
remains nearly the same. Because 
of this, seats for admission have 
become especially competitive, 
with in-state students having 
twice the admit rate as out-of-
state and international students.

“Generally 
speaking, 

residency 
determines 
the 

pool in which the applicants 
compete,” Ishop wrote. “Among 
the many qualities of a U-M 
education is the opportunity to 
experience a college education 
with students from different 
areas of the state of Michigan, 
all counties of the United States, 
and over 150 countries of the 
world. 
Educational 
diversity 

is 
important 
for 
the 
21st 

century educated student who 
is preparing to go out into the 
world to lead.”

LSA sophomore Alexandra 

Niforos, an in-state student, 
agreed in-state versus out-of-
state factors aren’t limiting to 
the University’s diverse aspect, 
as 
both 
resident 
and 
non-

resident students bring different 
backgrounds to the table.

“Michigan is pretty diverse 

in what backgrounds people 
can come from because they 
can come anywhere from rural 
Michigan to central Detroit,” 
Niforos said. “Everyone has a 
different background, but maybe 
bringing perspectives from other 
states, other school districts, 
other educational standards.”

When 
considering 
the 

financial aspect of enrollment, 
however, 
both 
Conrad 
and 

Niforos agreed the discrepancy 
between in-state and out-of-
state tuition cannot go unnoticed 
and expressed concerns that 
many students remain unaware 
of exactly where their tuition 
dollars are being spent. 

student body won’t be as wealthy 
as the student body here. It’ll be 
as homogenous in terms of racial 
demographics, but I anticipate the 
politics might be less progressive.

TMD: Take us through your 

journey here. Nine years ago, you 
weren’t as involved when you 
were beginning your Ph.D., then 
moving to the front lines with the 
megaphone in your hand after 
#BBUM and Aura Rosser, and 
now you’re more in the classroom, 
taking an academic or advisory 
approach. What was that like for 
you?

McCoy: 
I 
was 
always 

interested in getting involved, 
but didn’t know where to go or 
what to participate in. There 
was organizing and protests, 
but I didn’t see as much of it. I 
remember a professor asking me 
when I first got here like, “Austin, 
where are all the protests?” and I 
didn’t have an answer in my first 
month in Ann Arbor. I focused 
more on trying to fulfill our 
requirements.

In 
the 
summer 
of 
2013, 

when George Zimmerman was 
acquitted for killing Trayvon 
Martin, I was extremely upset, 
and it was one of the few times 
in the last few years I’ve cried. 
One of those nights where I cried 
myself to sleep thinking about 
it. But it also moved me to get 

involved in issues pertaining to 
racism.

That fall, a friend of mine 

named Garrett Felber, who was a 
Ph.D. student in the Department 
of American Culture, asked if 
I wanted to co-write an op-ed 
for The Daily about affirmative 
action and the history of Black 
student protest. He pitched is as 
relevant given the week before 
there had been a silent protest on 
the Diag around a lack of diversity 
and I said sure. That was October, 
and a few months later, #BBUM 
went viral. That was the same 
night the Black Student Union, 
We are Michigan and A New 
Trotter had a mass meeting. 
That was the first time I’d been 
in a room where there was an 
overwhelming majority of Black 
students. The days and weeks 
before, Garrett and I had been 
talking about what we could do 
as graduate students. So after that 
meeting, me, him, and a Latina 
Ph.D. student named Tatiana 
Cruz, 
began 
organizing. 
We 

created the United Coalition for 
Racial Justice, the point of which 
was to support #BBUM, but we 
also wanted to do an overnight 
teach-in. The organizing for the 
speak-out for racial justice the 
following year was the first time 
I had gotten involved on campus.

TMD: You’ve always been 

someone to invest in students 
and their organizing, wants and 
needs, and strategies. Where does 
that come from for you?

McCoy: Part of this comes from 

my own undergraduate years 
at (The Ohio State University at 
Mansfield), my hometown. The 
student body there was a lot more 
conservative, so it was me and a 
few other people who would do 
organizing 
around 
anti-racist 

movements and against the Iraq 
War. It was small things like 
panels and writing letters to the 
editors, anything that would raise 
awareness. We had support from 
a lot of professors and students, 
but there were few people around 
who I felt like I could talk to about 
organizing.

I believe in understanding 

when your role can change. I 
don’t think one person should 
always be out front, and I believe 
that if you’re an organizer, part of 
what you’re doing as an organizer 
is facilitating. You help connect 
people, and you support the 
people who will be on the front 
lines. It was once the organizing 
around Aura Rosser began to 
mature in 2015 — there were other 
people who were stepping up like 
Maryam Aziz who were doing 
a phenomenal job. There were 
other undergrads who would get 
involved around that, or student 
labor, and they began asking me 
to do teach-ins. People would 
come asking me to talk about 
diversity or the history of Black 
student protests or the history 
of UCRJ … The more I did that, 
the more people asked me to do 
teach-ins, the more undergrads 
would come to me asking about 
organizing and balancing life and 

school. It was a feedback loop. It’s 
important to be there for students 
as much as possible. In undergrad, 
if I saw a professor I liked at an 
event I organized, it was always 
energizing and comforting. I’m 
perfectly content with not being 
the face of everything.

TMD: The balance of academic, 

personal, political is hard. I know 
this has been a difficult year for 
you in many ways. How do you 
think you’ve changed?

McCoy: On the one hand, 

my life changed when I started 
getting organizing with UCRJ. 
Up until then, I was always 
interested, but was also rather 
content with finishing my Ph.D., 
graduating and leaving. Even 
with UCRJ, I thought we’d just do 
the speak-out and then be done. 
When we did that and we were 
successful, we began to get more 
people asking what we’d do next. 
There’s a next? And a we? Between 
UCRJ and Aura Rosser, my life 
totally changed. I went from being 
a graduate student interested in 
organizing to someone with a 
profile. I would run into people 
who knew who I was, and I didn’t 
know who they were. Since then, 
my life hasn’t been the same.

TMD: Is that hard? To have a 

profile, the constant demands on 
your time?

McCoy: The time, that can get 

difficult. You want to help as many 
people as possible. You want to do 
everything, and sometimes you 
feel like you can do everything. But 
it gets to the point where you look 

at your calendar and everything 
there is speaking, meetings or 
something 
else 
that’s 
related 

to politics. There’s less things I 
have scheduled for finishing my 
dissertation, or even myself. I 
had less energy to do dissertation 
work, let alone a social life.

One funny change is that I 

just watch more TV because I’m 
organizing all day. During UCRJ 
and Ann Arbor to Ferguson I’d 
be on campus all day and I’d get 
back home like, I’m going to work. 
But I’d turn on the TV and just 
knock out. My mind and my body 
were telling me that I couldn’t do 
anything right now.

That was a common theme with 

a lot of us here. Especially when it 
came to #BlackLivesMatter and 
the Aura Rosser killings, police 
seemed to be killing someone 
every month, no one got indicted, 
and there was just a constant 
cycle of vigils and actions. The 
violence is literally a matter of life 
and death, and that can happen 
to everyone who’s a part of a 
marginalized group anywhere. 
Recognizing that reality raised 
the stakes. And once the stakes 
were raised that high, I felt like 
I needed to be at every single 
protest, protesting every time 
something happened.

This past year, I knew this was 

going to be my last year no matter 
what, so it made more sense to 
serve in an advisory capacity. You 
can ask me to come speak and I 
would do that, but I was forced 
to 
juggle 
other 
professional 

obligations—I was away doing 
interviews every week—but then 
obviously with my mom passing, 
you just can’t. Something like 
that so personal happens that you 
have no option but to reprioritize. 
I had to grieve and be there for my 
family.

TMD: In the beginning of 

2016, it was Alton Sterling, 
then Philando Castile, one after 
another after another. There 
were so many vigils, I wondered 
if it was taking more from us 
than it was putting back in. How 
important are the protests?

McCoy: 
The 
vigils, 
the 

marches, going to City Council to 
confront political leaders, those 
things are very important. There 
were die-ins on the Diag, in the 
Law School after Baltimore and 
Sandra Bland. Are we focusing 
too much on reacting to the 
various shootings abroad versus 
Aura Rosser? Overlooking the fact 
that a 40-year old Black woman 
was shot right here in Ann Arbor, 
the mayor hadn’t apologized, the 
officer was never officially fired, 
her family had to deal with that 
trauma? There was a lot to focus 
on here, and we understood 
that. One the one hand, we 
felt compelled to respond to 
everything because other people 
here on campus had a desire 
to respond to Freddie Gray or 
Sandra Bland and #SayHerName. 

technology in life as well. 

Kristine Konz, a clinical social 

worker at the Depression Center, 
started the talk by explaining just 
how pervasive technology is and 
how we have molded our lives 
around it.

“We shape (our) environment 

and routines with devices,” Konz 
said. “When (we’re) tired and bored, 
(we) turn aimlessly to technology. 
(People) ages 18-24 check (their) 
phones 75 times per day.”

She explained how this addiction 

to technology also significantly 
impacts mental health as rates 
of depression and anxiety have 
increased by 70 percent in the past 
25 years in young adults. An increase 
in sleep problems, low self-esteem 
and eating disorders have also been 
noted with the growing presence of 
technology in our lives.

This 
phenomenon 
has 
also 

been linked to the increase in 
cyberbullying, doubling in the 
last seven years, with increased 
instances of self-harm, suicidal 
ideation and, occasionally, suicidal 
completion. Konz explained this 
correlation by connecting more 
time spent on social media to higher 
rates of social isolation.

“(With) less face-to-face contact, 

social circles become smaller, even 
though more time is spent on social 
media,” Konz said.

Konz also went on to describe 

the consequences of social media 
in particular. She discussed the 
concept of information overload, too 
many virtual friends to stay in touch 
with and growing concerns over the 

lack of privacy on social media.

“(You) become a target after 

sharing personal data and employers 
do watch (your profiles),” Konz said. 
 
 

The seminar then went on 

to highlight the positive impact 
technology has had. Connecting 
with people from around the 
world, 
easy 
and 
immediate 

communication, real-time news and 
a heightened access to information 
were some of the benefits listed. 

Konz ended the seminar on a 

more positive note by prescribing 
ways to counter the overbearing 
influence technology has on 
people. She advised to disconnect 
from 
technology 
and 
use 

unscheduled time to check in 
with yourself and essentially 
become more in tune with your 
surroundings.

“Take time to interact with 

the world around, especially with 
nature, people and pets,” Konz 
said.

LSA sophomore Julia Lauer 

explained how mindlessly using 
social media has been linked to 
a drop in overall well-being — 
especially when it is being used 
to passively consume others’ 
heavily-curated images and posts.

“Studies prove that simply 

scrolling through social media, 
passively, for 10 minutes can 
decrease one’s mood and well-
being in the following hours,” she 
said. “If you aren’t using social 
media actively then you’re at risk 
for putting yourself in a lower 
mental state by exposing yourself 
to an endless stream of others’ 
‘happiness.’ 
Definitely 
taking 

some time to realize this and 
adjust your social media habits 
to be an active user can help 
someone practice better social 

media engagement.”

Engineering junior Anna Learis, 

senior editor of Mentality Magazine, 
emphasized technology is actually 
not inherently bad in relation to self-
care. However, it cannot take the 
place of real-life practices.

“While 
it’s 
definitely 
clear 

that increased phone use, more 
importantly, 
increased 
social 

media use, is often harmful to one’s 
self-esteem and well-being due 
to comparing oneself to others, at 

the same time this instant access 
to technology can be extremely 
helpful,” 
Learis 
said. 
“From 

meditation apps to apps that allow 
you to text with a therapist, there are 
so many new resources at people’s 
fingertips 
that 
weren’t 
there 

before. I think utilizing self-care 
resources like the apps and websites 
I mentioned above are a great start, 
but without incorporating real-life 
self-care, there’s only so much that 
virtual self-care can accomplish.”

The University has met its 

goal of reducing chemical

protecting the Huron River 
through stormwater control 
strategies. The University

Opinion
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
4A — Wednesday, April 11, 2018

The 
Michigan 
Daily 
Editorial 
Board 
believes 
the 
Race 
and 
Ethnicity 
class requirement should be 
expanded to all of the schools 
for students in undergraduate 
programs at the University of 
Michigan. As it is currently 
only required in LSA, the Ford 
School of Public Policy and the 
School of Art & Design, this 
requirement should be for all 
students regardless of school 
and major. As of now, some 
schools within the University 
have their own requirements 
into 
which 
a 
Race 
and 
Ethnicity requirement could 
fit. For example, the College 
of 
Engineering 
 
requires 
16 credits of “intellectual 
breadth.” 
Requirements 
like these could be ample 
opportunities into which a 
Race and Ethnicity course 
could be fit into. Another 
way these courses could be 
implemented 
within 
each 
school would be for each 
college 
to 
create 
a 
Race 
and Ethnicity course which 
related to specific fields of 
study, which would allow 
students to understand how 
diversity can and does impact 
their future field.
The components of the 
requirement listed on the 
LSA website are also vague 
as it pertains to the structure 
of 
Race 
and 
Ethnicity 
courses. While the University 
mentions that, “Every course 
satisfying 
the 
requirement 
must devote substantial, but 
not 
necessarily 
exclusive, 
attention 
to 
the 
required 
content,” it does not define 
what could be considered 
“substantial.” 
This, 
along 
with the extent of classes 
which fulfill the requirement, 
provides 
too 
much 
room 

for 
vague 
connections 
to 
race 
and 
ethnicity 
rather 
than a structured focus. As 
the University focuses on 
its 
Diversity, 
Equity 
and 
Inclusion plan, we would hope 
that additional focus could be 
placed on strengthening this 
specific classroom experience.

In 
order 
to 
address 
concerns that students have 
with the current Race and 
Ethnicity requirement, the 
University 
should 
revise 
courses with the actual goals 
of the requirement as their 
focus. Currently, it appears 
as if the actual topics of race 
and ethnicity are an ancillary 
component of many courses 
given 
the 
label. 
Courses 
need to be crafted with the 
requirement in mind for it to 
actually serve its purpose.
There are certain elements 
that could be implemented in 
Race and Ethnicity courses 
which could cultivate fruitful 
discussion 
and 
awareness. 
Namely, 
a 
move 
towards 
smaller, 
discussion-based 
classes, 
rather 
than 
large 
lectures, 
would 
be 
more 
conducive 
to 
having 
deep 
conversations truly centered 
around race and ethnicity. 
Many of the classes that count 
for the requirement are larger 

classes, 
including 
History 
101: What is History? and 
Anthrcul 
101: 
Introduction 
to Anthropology. While these 
classes 
are 
important 
to 
majors and may have a race 
and ethnicity component to 
them, the large class size 
is not an effective method 
for 
having 
critical 
and 
introspective discussions.
Race and ethnicity topics 
from the past and the present 
should be the centerpiece 
of 
courses 
fulfilling 
the 
requirement, 
particularly, 
issues prevalent on campus. 
We feel that these issues could 
be best addressed through a 
possible one-credit required 
mini-course 
for 
freshmen 
that focuses on race and 
ethnicity on campus and in 
the lives of everyday students. 
Starting discussions of this 
kind early on in students’ 
college experience is key to 
promoting a campus climate 
all students feel welcome and 
safe in.
As the University campus 
functions as a place to grow 
in our intellectual niches, it is 
also a place to think critically 
about issues that inherently 
affect us outside of our majors. 
The 
Race 
and 
Ethnicity 
requirement, has not lived 
to its potential in fostering 
dialogue and awareness of 
pressing racial issues. As it 
stands now, it is more of a 
box to check off, instead of a 
course to think outside of the 
box. 
However, 
redesigning 
the structure and criteria of 
race and ethnicity could have 
profound effects in starting 
difficult conversations and 
shedding light on the topics 
we far too often gloss over.

The struggle for diversity in physics

ROBERT DALKA | COLUMN

MAGGIE MIHAYLOVA | COLUMN
I 

didn’t want to waste my last 
column on writing something 
sappy. With so many important 
issues in the world, I find it slightly 
irresponsible to solely muse on the 
self or to simply get deep. My goal 
for this column has been to provide 
my opinion on pertinent topics in a 
compelling, informed way. I want my 
voice to ring clear, loud and effective.
But as I scrolled through The 
Michigan Daily’s website for a 
lunchtime read, I found myself drawn 
to the reflective pieces that many of 
my peers had written in honor of the 
ending year or just contemplations 
on life. As nostalgia overcame me, I 
felt inspired to reflect on my own life 
and freshman year, so I sat down to 
write. I soon came to realize that 
writing passionately about a topic 
and writing passionately about 
yourself are two very different, 
contradictory things — even for a 
self-proclaimed narcissist.
Writing has always been my 
outlet. Since I was a kid, I would 
use my writing skills to persuade, 
move and entertain people. For 
example, I saved a lot of money on 
buying presents by writing songs or 
poems for my parents’ birthdays. In 
high school, I joined poetry club, the 
school newspaper and the literary 
magazine. I was constantly thinking, 
talking and writing, but always with 
careful calculation. I would agonize 
over words — tinkering and toying 
with language until I was sure I 
wanted to expose my work to an 
audience. I never let my words stand 
alone. I always stated a disclaimer 
before a reading. And I never, ever, 
wrote explicitly about myself — only 
characters with similar features.
A lesson I’ve learned in college 
is that vulnerability usually comes 

with hurt. To show real emotion, to 
allow yourself that honesty, will lead 
to pain. However, it is what comes in 
the fallout that is beautiful. There is 
a common conception that through 
suffering one produces the best art, 
and I can’t argue with that. I am 
grateful for my life and how smooth 
it has been for me, but my proudest 
creative works don’t come from a 
sunny summer afternoon or the 
smell of birthday cake, they come 
from a hospital waiting room or the 
floor of a public bathroom.
My freshman year has been 
contradictory — a combination of 
both exploding joy and forceful 
sadness. 
I 
often 
experienced 
isolation and togetherness within 
the same day. I felt impassioned in 
one class and resigned in another. 
I balanced finding myself with 
finding someone for me. In this 
constant limbo, I struggled to 
gain footing, and I seldom didn’t 
stumble. It wasn’t until a couple 
weeks ago that I realized that by 
stifling these feelings, by masking 
their intensity, I was doing a 
disservice to myself as a writer and 
human being.
I have always feared expressing 
my emotions liberally, without 
the guise of character or fiction. 
Because of this, not only did 
my writing suffer, but so did 
my relationships. I lacked the 
vulnerability to bear my soul 
to the world because of fear 
of 
judgment, 
inferiority 
and 
rejection, and in turn, I faced 
miscommunications, 
missed 
chances and made mistakes.
So recently, in the name of my 
newfound “college maturity,” I 
started being more emotionally 
honest, and what I have discovered 

is that if what you write or say is 
what you feel, regardless of quality, 
it will touch someone. We are all 
disordered spirits, yearning for 
validation while craving solace. We 
all feel hurt with the same intensity 
as we feel love. And yet, we shy 
away from expressing the depth of 
the everyday — the commonplace.
On the exterior, our daily lives 
follow the same simple pattern: We 
wake up, we go to work or school 
and go to bed. It is the moments 
within this simple pattern that 
fulfill us as humans — and it takes 
words to illuminate this truth. 
Writing provides us with the soul of 
existence. Life in words is a shared 
glance in a dark room, the hum of 
bass in your favorite song and the 
first snowfall of April. Life in words 
is touching someone you love, the 
pumping of legs on a bike and the 
smell of pine trees on a Sunday 
morning walk. But life in words is 
also a drunken argument, an IV in 
your left wrist and a Frank Ocean 
album on repeat.
Art and writing, in particular, 
remind us of the intensity of 
simplicity. I have been guilty of 
spending my life in phases of 
boredom or just going through the 
motions. My writing and my life 
have been predictable, organized 
and neat. It took me 18 years and a 
few bouts of pain to finally realize 
the beauty in existence, both from 
hurt and happiness. And as I finish 
off what ended up being a sappy 
column, I’m nervous for its reception. 
To quell that anxiety? I think I’ll go 
write a poem.

F

or much of its history, physics 
has been dominated by white 
men. 
Most 
well-known 
constants and equations are named 
after them, and when someone says 
“physicist,” what usually comes to 
mind is a white man. The stereotype 
is deeply rooted in the homogenous 
history of academia, but as our 
country and institutions become 
more diverse, shouldn’t the world of 
physics follow?
Sadly, this has not been the case. 
According to the 2016 population 
estimates based on the 2010 U.S. 
census, 17.8 percent of the population 
identifies as Hispanic or Latino 
and 13.3 percent of the population 
identifies 
as 
Black 
or 
African 
American. However, according to 
statistics from the American Institute 
of Physics, only about 3.9 percent of 
the bachelor’s degrees in physics were 
awarded to African Americans and 
only 7.6 percent to Hispanics.
To better understand the issue, 
I interviewed Brian Beckford, a 
presidential postdoctoral fellow here 
at the University of Michigan, to 
learn more about his own experience 
as a physicist of color, and an active 
advocate for diversity in STEM. 
His research concerns nuclear and 
particle physics.
When 
Beckford 
started 
as 
an 
undergraduate 
at 
Florida 
International University, he was 
initially interested in philosophy. 
Eventually, 
philosophy 
became 
limited in the answers it could 
provide him for the types of questions 
he had about how the universe works, 
and Beckford decided to switch his 
major to physics.
FIU boasts one of the most 
diverse student bodies in the country, 
but Beckford still found himself an 
outsider after switching majors.
“My friends and I joked that I 
was the best Black student in physics 
because I was the only Black student 
in the physics department at the 
time,” Beckford said.
While 
Beckford 
notes 
the 
department 
was 
never 
actively 
discriminatory, the idea of promoting 
diversity was never talked about. 
It was not seen as a priority of the 
department at the time.
Due to the fact that the traditional 
social and professional spheres of 
physics have not always strived to 
be inclusive, those who have been 
left on the outskirts have managed 
by creating their own spaces in 
which they could feel welcome in a 
community. The National Society of 
Black Physicists was formed in 1977, 
and since its inception has worked 
toward improving the experiences 
of Black physicists. Each year, 
NSBP hosts a national conference 
celebrating 
accomplishments 
by 
Black physicists from every field 
of physics. Beckford first attended 
this conference early in his graduate 
studies and goes back each year as his 

schedule allows.
“My faculty advisor at FIU 
and really good friend to this day, 
Professor Joerg Reinhold, German 
by descent, directed me towards the 
NSBP conference,” Beckford said. 
“(The conference) gave me some 
hope that there is a chance, and there 
is a space for physicists of color. I 
realized there would be a place for me 
in the field.”
Though 
conferences 
such 
as the NSBP meeting are well 
advertised 
at 
historically 
Black 
colleges and universities, they are 
not as talked about at institutions 
that are historically white. Helping 
to increase awareness of these 
kinds of opportunities is one way 
institutions such as ours can create 
a more welcoming, supportive 
environment for people from all 
different backgrounds.
“This year I am trying to 
encourage the department that we 
can attend the conference as a source 
of recruiting a more diverse group of 
students into the graduate program,” 
Beckford said.
In addition to his work as a 
researcher, as the department’s 
diversity, 
equity 
and 
inclusion 
committee chair, Beckford devotes as 
much time as he can to finding new 
ways the department can be more 
inclusive by bringing his experience 
as a project manager for the American 
Physical Society Bridge Program.
Many of Beckford’s proposed 
changes and improvements are 
focused on the recruitment of 
graduate 
students, 
including 
short-term projects, such as the 
new 
recruitment 
brochure. 
It 
highlights the inclusive ideals of 
the department. It is small, but 
represents 
an 
important 
step 
toward 
much-needed 
change. 
Long-term projects are in the 
works, but will take more time, 
as they require more cooperation 
and 
coordination 
among 
the 
department before these changes 
are seen as necessary in order to 
create a stronger, more diverse 
physics program at the University.
I was also curious about what 
Beckford thought could be done 
to increase representation among 
undergraduate students.
“Stronger discussions of career 
opportunities after an undergrad 
degree would be a great way to bring 
more diversity into the undergrad 
program,” he said. “Particularly 
among first-generation students and 
students of color, there is a feeling of 
a need to give back, not only to their 
community, but to their family that 
might be sacrificing a lot for them to 
be there.”
I agree with Beckford, and a 
physics degree is really what you 
make it. You can put it to use many 
different ways. You can work in 
industry, research the frontiers of 
science in academia, affect social 

change as a teacher or community 
leader and much more. This is what 
makes a physics degree so exciting.
Once a school succeeds in 
recruiting a diverse student base, 
the next challenge is retainment. 
According to the Office of the 
Registrar 
2016 
report, 
of 
the 
freshmen who came to the University 
in 2012, 14.1 percent of those from 
underrepresented minority groups 
have left the University without 
finishing a degree. When comparing 
this with the 8 percent from all 
other groups that have left without 
finishing a degree, one can see the 
lack of inclusion most certainly plays 
a role in the discrepancy. We must 
recognize we can make the campus 
and departments more welcoming 
for everyone.
“The hard part is we have to 
change people’s mindset, and that 
diversity and inclusion is important 
for science,” Beckford said. “It’s 
people who do the science, so it 
follows that if you want the best 
science, you get the best people from 
all groups, and not just one.”
Academia is not always known 
for its adaptability, and tradition still 
plays a major role in how institutions 
and departments run. It can be 
tough to get every decision maker on 
board, as not everyone believes that 
a change is needed at all. However, 
this way of thinking goes against 
what we are trying to do in science, 
which is to advance human thought 
and make new discoveries. So even 
though old styles of mentoring and 
teaching might have worked when 
there was one majority group, we 
need to make improvements on how 
we do things and take every new 
factor into account.
After 
my 
interview 
with 
Beckford, I began to think about 
how critical it is to be more inclusive 
in the sciences. I feel it is especially 
important in today’s political and 
social climate to ensure that science 
is a beacon of inclusivity, of higher 
thinking and unlimited possibility, 
where all are welcome to create, 
discover and succeed.
At the end of our talk, Beckford 
asked, “How many great ideas were 
lost to fear, hate, and intolerance?” 
Too many to count, I would 
imagine. As we are those who strive 
towards higher understanding, we 
must never let untapped potential 
be wasted because of the fear of 
change or the lack of willingness 
to allocate resources and time to 
undertake the challenge. We can 
spark this change, right here, right 
now, at the University.

Inclusion committee.

Revamp Race and Ethnicity

I

n 2014, the University of Michigan reformed the Race and 
Ethnicity requirement after student activists pushed to include 
an intersectional approach to the classes offered under the 
requirement. Recently, the Race and Ethnicity requirement has come 
under fire by students for its perceived inability to critically address 
race and ethnicity, racism and discrimination in domestic and global 
contexts. Additional scrutiny has been placed on the requirement, 
after bias incidents, such as a blackface Snapchat, represented for 
many a lack of understanding on campus. To address the pressing 
concerns of students and the campus climate, the University should 
design specific Race and Ethnicity courses with the true goals of 
the requirement in mind, putting a focus on engaging students in 
in-depth discussions about race and ethnicity.

Courses need to 
be crafted with 
the requirement 
in mind for it to 
actually serve its 
purpose.

Revisiting: U.K.’s ‘Skins’ 

“Skins.” A world where parents 
don’t care about their children, 
teachers have sex with their 
students, friends treat each other 
like shit and the 16-17 year old 
protagonists somehow have the 
money to fund the drug usage 
of an erratic Wall Street broker 
(How are the joints always so big? 
And always so perfectly rolled?). 
“Skins,” more than any other TV 
show or movie I’ve watched in 
the coming-of-age genre, asks its 
audience to suspend disbelief.
If there’s one accomplishment 
“Skins” should be praised for, it’s 
the ability of its co-creators, father 
and son duo Jamie Brittain and 
Bryan Elsley (“Dates”), to write 
dynamic and compelling teenage 
characters. Every two seasons, 
“Skins” switches its entire cast 
(save for a few adults that overlap 
stories) and the audience has 
to develop attachments to the 
characters all over again. It only 
took a few episodes at the start of 
each series to grow fond of the new 
cast that is a testament to the duo’s 
ability.
“Skins” often gets knocked for 
its slow decrease in quality with 
each new cast. However, this has 
nothing to do with the characters 
themselves. “Skins” seems to 
have a list of tropes that it glues 
to different people each season. 
There’s the brain, the pretty boy, 
the druggie, the loser, the party 
animal, the misunderstood girl, 
the one overshadowed by their 
peer — the list could go on and on. 
All of these are used every series, 

just in different combinations.
The show does its best to mix 
them differently enough to create 
characters that feel new, but one 
can see some obvious similarities 
in characters between seasons. 
Season 
three-to-four’s 
Cook 
(Jack O’Connell, “Godless”) is 
season one-to-two’s Chris (Joe 
Dempsie, “Game of Thrones”) 
with just a little more “I don’t 
give a fuck”; scorned, red headed 
twin Emily (Kathryn Prescott, 
“24: Legacy”) of seasons three-
to-four is the overshadowed, 
hopelessly romantic virgin — aka 
Syd (Mike Bailey, “We Are The 
Freaks”) of seasons one-to-two; 
and overly-hormonal Alo (Will 
Merrick, “Poldark”) of seasons 
5-6 has only one motivation: to 
get laid, which parallels Anwar 
(Dev Patel, “Lion”) of seasons one-
to-two. However, they’re almost 
always captivating individuals, 
similarities be damned.
The cast of the first series 
balances these tropes the best 
across 
characters, 
but 
the 
other series’ casts also contain 
fascinating personas. Cook and 
Effy (Kaya Scodelario, “Pirates of 
the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No 
Tales”) from the second series are 
my favorites of the entire show. 
They go beyond their tropes. 
Cook’s more than just a drugged 

out lunatic, and his past is both 
tragic and privileged. Effy, above 
all other characters, is the face of 
“Skins.” Nobody, including the 
audience, ever really knows what 
is going on her head. Frankie 
and Grace from the third series 
go beyond their tropes as well 
(although they grow a little too 
fast for the narrative’s own good).
The problem with “Skins” is that 
it has no idea how to insert these 
well-constructed characters into 
the real world. In the first series, 
the parents of the protagonists 
are present but not impactful; the 
teenagers go to school, but only 
when it is convenient for the story. 
The last two series only exacerbate 
this dilemma. The only relevant 
parents in the second series are 
those of Emily and Katie, and the 
only reason they’re relevant is to 
showcase the toll divorce takes 
on a family, which they already 
did with Tony and Effy’s parents. 
So I’m edged to ask — what is the 
point?
In the second series, there are 
points where school disappears 
altogether. In the first few episodes 
of series three, the protagonists 
are seen in school every day, 
seemingly more than during any 
point in the first two series, but this 
is only because it’s the convenient 
way to start getting them all to 
interact with one another. By the 
end of the series, Emily is living 
with Naomi and never going to 
school (where the fuck is Naomi’s 
mom, by the way?). Katie is dealt 
a head injury and can apparently 
never handle education again but 
can work for her mom. Effy and 
Freddie treat Effy’s house as a 
permanent love nest, and Cook is 

miraculously house jumping after 
having somehow escaped prison. 
The Cook storyline, in particular, 
is straight up lazy writing on an 
unforgivable level.
“Skins” can’t decide what it 
wants its identity to be. Half the 
time, it aims to be a dreamy are-
we-in-reality-or-not 
Lynchian 
commentary 
on 
the 
general 
absurdity of life. The other half, 
it aims to be a British teenage 
melodrama.
The show admirably attempts 
to comment on contemporary 
social issues. LGBTQ+ youth, 
mental health, divorce, misogyny, 
immigration, etc. are all brought 
to the surface, but it’s hard to 
relate to the characters when they 
don’t feel grounded in reality and 
everything works out for them in 
the end.
The only aspect of “Skins” that 
makes it often legitimately painful 
to watch is its obnoxious use of 
music. If you remove season seven 
from the equation, there are an 
average of 14.7 songs per episode. 
14.7! That’s insane! Not only does 
the music completely oversaturate 
the sound of the episodes, but 
the lyrics often parallel the exact 
action or emotion of the characters 
on screen. It’s like there’s an 
unnecessary narrator explaining 
to the audience exactly what is 

going on even though it’s obvious 
enough already.
Despite 
all 
its 
absurdity, 
“Skins,” at the very least, is 
entertaining from start to finish 
(excluding season seven). It has 
its share of problems, some larger 
than others, but the characters 
always pulled me back in. I wanted 
to know what happened to them. I 
cared about them, and that’s why I 
watch television.
Lastly, don’t watch season 
seven. Never have I watched 
something so pointless to the plot 
of a television show. When I think 
of “Skins,” I pretend that season 
seven doesn’t exist.
“Chris,” season 2, episode 5:
There’s a point in this episode 
where the entire group of friends 
is at a party. Chris is selling drugs 
and the first line of dialogue at the 
party comes from the leader of the 
group he sold them to. “I hate this 
conformist repressive society,” 
says the kid as he continues to go 
on a rant about how everyone has 
the same “plastic” job and wears 
the same “plastic” clothes. Then 
the camera cuts to a long shot 
and we see that the boy speaking 
and all his friends are wearing 
the exact same outfit and are all 
clearly high on what Chris sold 
them. Then, the boy looks at Chris 
and says “I mean, you’re cool cause 
you got drugs, but everybody 
else...” and then buys more drugs 
from Chris.
A hallmark theme of “Skins” is 
communicating that there is no 
such thing as “normal.” Everyone 
has traits that separate them 
from the crowd. Anyone who says 
everyone is the same is themselves 
a part of the culture they are 

judging and their eagerness to 
comment on others most likely 
stems from their own insecurities.
This episode also is a perfect 
example of “Skins” as a teenage 
melodrama. Chris and Jal take 
giant steps in their relationship. 
Chris gets a job at a real estate 
company, Jal is pregnant and the 
two decide to move in together. 
Keep in mind these people are the 
same age as an American senior in 
high school.
“Effy,” season 3, episode 8:
This episode, above all others, 
parallels my perception of “Skins.” 
It combines dreamlike absurdity 
and surrealism more than any 
other episode.
The gang decides to go camping 
in the woods for Katie’s birthday, 
and from the very beginning, we 
know that everything is going to 
go wrong. Why the hell would 
Katie let Effy, who’s tearing apart 
her relationship with Freddie 
(Luke Pasqualino, “Snatch”), come 
to the woods with them and the 
rest of season’s characters? Effy 
somehow finds magic mushrooms 
conveniently growing right next 
to their campsite and coerces all 
of her fellow campers to eat them. 
Secrets are brought to the surface, 
Effy hooks up with Freddie, 
Katie is hit over the head with a 
rock by Effy and Cook shows up

‘Country Dark’ is a largely 
unsatisfying, lacking read

“Country 
Dark,” 
Chris 
Offutt’s return to fiction, is 
an 
ultimately 
unsatisfying 
and disappointing tale. Set in 
rural Kentucky during the ’60s 
and ’70s, Offutt attempts to 
interrogate a number of social 
issues — poverty, post-traumatic 
stress disorder, incarceration, 
violence — but the result leaves 
much to be desired.
“Country 
Dark” 
follows 
Tucker, 
Rhonda 
and 
their 
five young children, four of 
whom 
have 
intellectual 
or 
physical 
disabilities. 
Two 
social workers investigate the 
family. Midway through the 
novel, Tucker murders one of 
the social workers because he 
threatens to put Tucker and 
Rhonda’s children in the state’s 
care. Tucker is subsequently 
sent to jail. He returns home, 
seemingly unchanged. Rhonda 
cares for their children, some 
of whom are eventually taken 
from her. Tucker comes home, 
and the novel ends. No one in 
this book is especially invested 
in what happens to themselves, 
and it’s that lack of interest and 
agency that ultimately sabotages 
“Country Dark.”
If there’s one thing “Country 
Dark” does well, however, it’s to 
create a sense of place. Offutt, 

who was born and raised in 
Kentucky, describes the setting 
of “Country Dark” with intimate 
attention to detail. “The world 
appeared for the first time 
beautiful,” Offutt writes. “The 

air scoured of dust by the rain, 
each surface holding a sheen 
of water like a tiny prism on 
every leaf.” That close, familiar 
description deposits the reader 
into 
an 
easily 
imaginable 
world. 
Unfortunately, 
it’s 
a 
world populated by people who 
resemble robots.
Offutt is certainly a talented 
writer in many respects, but 
he struggles to create three-
dimensional 
characters. 
His 
female characters are especially 
lackluster. Of Rhonda, Offutt 
writes: “She wondered if their 
children would have his eyes. 
She took his hand and silently 
vowed to stay near him forever. 
She would never forsake this 
man.” For context, this scene 
occurs the day after Rhonda and 
Tucker meet. The pace of the 
novel is arbitrary and confusing; 

even a traumatized 14-year-old 
girl seems unlikely to pledge 
her life to a boy she’s just met. 
There’s 
nothing 
surprising, 
lifelike or transgressive about 
Offutt’s characters. “The storm 
would pass,” Offutt writes. “And 
(Tucker) didn’t care one way or 
another.” Why doesn’t he care? 
He should care! For readers 
to care about characters, the 
characters 
themselves 
must 
care. One keeps hoping Offutt 
will give his characters some 
humanity, 
but 
instead 
they 
seem to float through their lives 
with no internal reasoning or 
complexities, 
their 
emotions 
simple 
and 
surface-level. 
Everything is as it seems.
It 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
“Country Dark” is a novel 
propelled 
by 
violence, 
an 
authorial choice that always 
puts the writer to task. If 
violence is to be a central theme, 
it must be justified — in the 
formal of social commentary, 
insightfulness or even character 
development. Unfortunately, the 
violence in “Country Dark” is 
simply a foreboding and often 
indiscriminate presence. The 
world is violent, certainly — 
but what do we do with that 
violence? How to we come to 
terms with it, or explain it, 
or understand it? These are 
questions raised by “Country 
Dark,” but not ones it offers any 
meaningful answers to.

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘BACK IN BROOKLYN’

 Brooklyn-based artist Nandi 
Rose Plunkett has been mak-
ing music for her project Half 
Waif for a little over half of a 
decade, but it feels that now 
more than ever she’s on the 
cusp of breaking through to 
a larger audience. Since the 
beginning, her focus has been 
on crafting a delicate blend 
of classically inflected vocal 
melodies and hyper-modern 
electronica. Someone will 
probably come for me for 
saying it, but I’m tempted to 
draw a comparison between 
Half Waif and Flume, or at 
least between some of the 
otherworldly textures and 
syncopation that characterize 
significant portions of their 
respective bodies of work.
 Conspicuously absent 
from “Back in Brooklyn,” 
the third and final single 
ahead of Lavender’s Apr. 27 
release date, are those same 

electronic features that popu-
late the vast majority of her 
discography to date. Instead, 
Plunkett’s vocals and piano 

are the main characters in 
a largely soft-spoken ballad 
that offers reflections on 
being away from home — love, 
separation and the interplay 
between the two. On the one 
hand, “It’s easy and it’s right 
/ It’s freezing and it’s bright 
/ It’s everything I like,” sings 
Plunkett, referring to the city 
she calls home. On the other, 
“It’s easier to stay / Half a 
world away / Forgetting every 
name.” In between, the men-
tion of someone, presumably a 

lover, whom the narrator calls 
upon her return. “‘Where 
have you been?’ / Don’t ask 
me that,” she anticipates their 
conversation.
 After lulling her listener 
into a daze, Plunkett silences 
herself to a whisper. But 
it’s when she makes this 
comparison that her voice 
crests, grating with emotion 
in the song’s most cathar-
tic moment: “Listen for me 
now,” she shouts. It’s hard 
to tell what exactly Plunkett 
means when she sings that 
she’s “Casting off (her) half-
empty shell,” but it’s hard 
not to believe her. Like her 
songs, Plunkett becomes more 
complex with every passing 
moment. Lavender could be 
any number of things, but it’s 
bound to be captivating.

out of nowhere. It’s predictably 
ludicrous.
“Freddie,” season 4, episode 5
“Skins” has a lot to say about 
love. The most memorable love 
story of the show also takes the 
longest to come to fruition. When 
they finally become a couple, Effy 
and Freddie take refuge in Effy’s 
house and turn it into a palace of 
sex and drugs, but the honeymoon 
doesn’t last forever. Effy’s mental 
health deteriorates to a point that 
Freddie has to seek help.
Like 
everything 
portrayed 
in “Skins,” the writers handle 
mental health in a paradoxically 

problematic 
and 
progressive 
way. As Effy’s well-being gets 
worse and worse, Freddie does 
the best he can to help her. He 
asks for advice, tells her mother, 
spends as much time possible 
with Effy and urges her to seek 
professional help. Yet when Effy 
is suffering from mental illness, 
she is portrayed as losing any 
grip on reality. She, quite literally, 
seems to go insane. This isn’t how 
mental illness should be thought 
of by the millions of teenage 
viewers watching. Mental illness 
is a spectrum, and its intensity 
is individual to each person who 

experiences it. To depict mental 
illness as something that pushes 
you beyond the bounds of reality 
for 
dramatizing 
purposes 
is 
irresponsible. However, making 
the subject of mental health a 
cornerstone of the plot is, by itself, 
quite progressive for 2010.
“Skins” tries so hard to be a 
progressive show that comments 
on the contemporary issues of 
the time, but it always pushes it 
a little too far. Regardless of its 
flaws, “Skins” remains a staple in 
the TV arsenal of youth today due 
to its well-written characters and 
addicting over-dramatization.

DOING GREAT 
AND WE 
know you 
can do it. 

Don't give up!

I’ve always liked board games. 
For as long as I can remember I’ve 
played Monopoly with my dad and 
Scrabble with my grandpa. My 
brother and I used to play round 
after round of Battleship, Sorry! 
and Stratego. Chess had a strong 
place in my life for a while, until 
I cost my middle school Chess 
team the state championship and 
Chess and I more or less parted 
ways. High school introduced 
me to my first true board game 
love, Settlers of Catan, which still 
plays 
a 
prominent 
role in game nights 
all these years later. 
College has brought 
about a renaissance 
in my board game 
playing, with party 
games and Catan itself 
seemingly becoming 
more prevalent across 
campus by the day. 
Over the course of 
the past two years 
I 
have 
surrounded 
myself with equally 
competitive 
mad 
men who take no 
greater pleasure than watching 
the terrible misery of a poor soul 
who loses at a game made out 
of cardboard and plastic. But in 
our endless quest to achieve total 
domination over each other in 
games of skill and chance, one 
question has slowly emerged, 
“What value is there in winning a 
game of luck?”
On first glance the value would 
seem obvious. It’s clear that in any 
contest, regardless of the amount 
of skill involved, one would 
always prefer to win than to lose. 
Certainly that is the case, but 
when your win is judged against 
the wins of others, do you not 
want your win to stand above the 
rest, in the eternal glory of having 
been truly earned? If you win a 
coin flip, did you really “win” if 
you had no control over the events 
that led to your “victory?” Would 
it really be worth bragging about a 
game of rock, paper, scissors? The 
answer is no, and therein lies the 
board game conundrum.
Take, for example, the card 
game known as Coup. It’s a simple 
game of bluffing, in which players 
hold two of a possible six cards 
at any given time, granting them 
access to two of a possible six 
abilities. The twist is that there 
is no penalty for using an ability 
you don’t actually have, unless of 
course an opponent calls you out 
on your bluff and you lose one of 
your two cards (or the game if you 
only have one card left). At first my 
friend group believed this game 
was mostly skill-less, and it was 
just random chance if you called 
someone else out on their bluffing. 
Soon however we began to develop 
strategies, as we noticed patterns 
in each others games and realized 
some cards were better to end up 
with at the end of the game than 
others. Over time these strategies 
grew even deeper as we began to 
bluff, double bluff and triple bluff 
our way into victory. Is that other 
guy doing the thing I think he’s 
doing? Does he know I think he’s 
doing it? Does that mean he’s not 
going to do it because he thinks I 
think he will do it? What does that 
mean? Does it mean anything? 
Coup eventually became a battle 
of the wits, like the famous poison 
scene in “The Princess Bride.” 
Once you’ve gone down the rabbit 
hole of bluffing strategy and come 
out the other side you arrive back 
at the same place you began. If 
every move ever made is being 
made in an attempt to throw the 
other players off the scent, then 
no strategy can truly be formed 
because every strategy is based 
upon players playing rationally, 
which they wouldn’t be inclined 
to do for fear of giving away what 
cards they have. And so the game 
is one of chance. And therefore it 
involves no skill. So whoever wins 
has no ability to use their victory 
as proof that they are better than 
everyone else, which is one of the 
main reasons people like to win. 
Winning in essence becomes 
meaningless.
We faced a similar predicament 
with Catan. What at first appeared 

to be a mostly skill-based game of 
trading and building, with some 
luck involved (the roll of the 
dice), eventually became mired 
in arguments over whether or not 
the inherent luck of dice-rolling 
superseded any level of social 
interaction that would otherwise 
seem to be the crux of the game. 
Winners again found themselves 
besieged by the notion that they 
only won because they rolled four 
threes in a row, which everyone 
knows is less than probable. It 
seemed we had sucked 
the fun out of board 
games. 
Winning 
had been rendered 
utterly 
pointless. 
No longer could one 
find any satisfaction 
in 
defeating 
one’s 
friends.
It seemed there was 
only one solution. Two 
weeks ago one of my 
friends and I entered 
Vault of Midnight, the 
game and comic store 
located on Main St., 
and asked an employee 
to direct us to the game that 
involved “the most skill, the least 
luck.” She sold us a game called 
“Century: Spice Road.” At first, 
we thought we had found our holy 
grail at last. The game was devoid 
of dice and although it featured the 
drawing of cards, it was unclear 
if there was much of a difference 
between the cards that could be 
drawn. The game consisted of 
exchanging various colored cubes 
until one had the right number of 
cubes to unlock “points” cards, 
which gave one a certain number 
of points. Certainly, the game was 
mostly strategy. Getting your cube 
exchange rates correctly required 
thinking many turns ahead and 
there was almost no chance of 

someone messing up your game 
by torpedoing you or ganging up 
on you with other players. At last 
we had found a game without 
any luck. In doing so, we had also 
found a game without any fun. 
It turns out that luck is actually 
pretty synonymous with thrill. 
It’s the thrill of rolling the dice, 
the thrill of the QB throwing up 
a deep pass, of letting the hands 
of fate guide the ball, the roll, 
the flip of the river. Take that 
away, and take away the need 
to interact with other players 
during a game, and you no longer 
have a game, but a math problem 
that four people are attempting 
to solve simultaneously. As my 
brother so succinctly declared 
upon playing Century for fewer 
than five minutes, “It’s like four 
people playing solitaire at once.” 
The day after this proclamation 
we returned to Catan. We played 
a few rounds of Coup. That old 
thrill has returned, regardless of 
whether or not any one of us is 
truly more skilled at the games 
than another. In the end, so long 
as you are enjoying yourself, it 
doesn’t really matter if you win. 
At least, that’s what I like to tell 
myself when I lose. Don’t get me 
started on Euchre.

FILM REVIEW
‘A Quiet Place’ is acutely terrifying

John Krasinski’s (“The Hollars”) 
“A Quiet Place” explores a world 
where noise is the most dangerous 
element of all, where even a small 
cough can invite the deadly wrath 
of sound-seeking creatures, and 
where humans must completely 
adapt their way of life in order to stay 
hidden in plain sight. Krasinski’s 
film, which he co-wrote, directed 
and starred in, is an extremely 
inventive and acutely terrifying 
foray into the tensions between 
silence and sound, survival and 
sacrifice. “A Quiet Place” is intensely 
stressful and wholly engrossing; 
Krasinski’s manipulation of the 
rules and the stakes of his quakingly 
silent world makes for something 
overwhelming and nerve-jangling 
and brilliant.
“A Quiet Place” is a fascinating 
cross between a survival narrative 
and a horror film. The movie 
centers around the Abbott family, 
led by Lee (Krasinski) and Evelyn 
(Emily Blunt, “The Girl on the 
Train”), who have completely 
adapted every aspect of their 
way of life to survive. The most 
impressive parts of the film are 
these adaptations — Krasinski 
employs a clever understanding 
of light, textures and materials to 
make daily life and communication 
possible. From feeling Monopoly 
game pieces to pathways lined with 
cornmeal, Krasinski shows a firm 
grasp on the details and nuances 
of a world where every sound must 
be muffled. Watching this family 
go about their daily routine is just 
as engrossing as the moments of 
bloody horror, because every detail 
is so meticulously thought out and 
creative. 
Along with its moments of 
paralyzing fear, “A Quiet Place” 
weaves a moving emotional arc 
about family, love and sacrifice. 
With almost no dialogue, the film 
relies heavily on close-up shots 
to express emotion and illustrate 
the ways in which this family is 

strained and bonded. The film is 
anchored by the genuine chemistry 
between Krasinski and Blunt, 
a married couple off-screen as 
well, who believably will give 
anything to protect their children. 
Their daughter Regan (Millicent 
Simmonds, 
“Wonderstruck”), 
more vulnerable to the monsters 

because of her deafness, struggles 
against the coddling of her parents 
while trying to prove her ability 
to take care of herself. She also 
holds herself responsible for the 
accidental tragedy that happened 
on a scavenging trip the year 
before. 
Simmonds 
delivers 
a 
great performance rooted in her 
actual disability that works as the 
emotional fulcrum of the film. “A 
Quiet Place” is successful for its 
portrayal of a loving family despite 
impossible odds and bone-chilling 
horrors. 
Communication is a central 
theme in the film. Because of Regan’s 
deafness, the family already speaks 

fluent sign language. “A Quite 
Place” reverses the stereotypical 
marginalization of deafness by 
showcasing sign language as a 
vital tool for communication and 
survival in a silent world. In this 
way, the film works as a piece of 
speculative fiction that reimagines 
an impairment as an enhancement.
Above all, Emily Blunt is the 
sensational focal point of this film. 
Her character is intricately layered 
and expertly performed — she is 
the capable matriarch, tenacious 
in survival, but committed to 
the impossible task of bringing 
new life into this anarchic world. 
Blunt shoulders the weight of her 
character with grace and strength, 
proving once again her place in the 
Hollywood elite as a true movie 
star. She endures an endless series 
of horrors in this movie, always 
managing to center the story on 
family and perseverance over 
superficial jump-scares.
“A Quiet Place” is a horror movie 
unlike any other, an imaginative 
and thrilling deep-dive into the 
limitless ways humans can adapt 
and exist in severely limiting 
conditions. The film is unconcerned 
with 
the 
complications 
of 
a 
monster-ridden world at large, and 

instead focuses successfully on 
the dynamics of a single family’s 
struggle to connect and understand 

one another. It is a must-see that 
adds a new dimension to the genre 
of horror.

Blanco notches no-hitter in Wolverines’ victory over Eastern Michigan

For anyone that knows Tera 

Blanco, it’s not surprising that 
the senior right-hander’s walk-
up song is “God’s Plan” by 
Drake. Blanco always listens to 
the song to pump herself up and 
got her teammates to play the 
Canadian rapper’s music in the 
locker room.

When 
Blanco 
threw 
the 

first no-hitter of her college 
career in a 4-0 win against 
Eastern Michigan on Tuesday 
afternoon, the constant blaring 
of the hit single was, in a way, 
poetic. Every time the No. 17 
Michigan softball team left 
a runner stranded on base, 
Blanco came in the next inning 
and answered the prayers of the 
Wolverines, either with one of 
her 12 strikeouts or a laser to 
catch a runner at first base. 

“We weren’t a real inspired 

group today, and Tera has just 
been such a steady force for us 
all year,” said Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins. 
“I’m 
proud 
of 

her, 
she’s 
so 

deserving.”

That’s 
not 

to say that the 
right-hander’s 
ride 
to 
the 

no-hitter 
was 

smooth by any 
means. On the 
first pitch of the 
second 
inning, 

Eagles’ 
outfielder 
Brandice 

Olmos launched a shot to deep 
center that threatened to end 
Blanco’s bid before it was even 
conceivable. 

Junior 
outfielder 
Natalie 

Peters, 
however, 
had 
other 

plans. As the ball sailed straight 
over 
Blanco’s 
head, 
Peters 

started 
running 
from 
right 

field and didn’t stop until the 
ball was in her glove, making a 
twirling catch. 

In 
other 

moments 
when 

Blanco’s mastery 
was in danger, 
the 
California 

native 
pushed 

through on her 
own. 
In 
the 

sixth 
inning, 

Blanco 
found 

herself facing a 
3-1 count with 
no 
outs. 
Just 

like that, Blanco battled back to 
strike out the Eastern Michigan 
batter. 

The next batter came up to 

the plate for the Eagles, and 
with that came a 3-0 hole for 
Blanco to climb out of. Blanco 
fired off three straight swinging 
strikes. 

“I was frustrated with always 

getting behind, and not getting 
ahead,” Blanco said. “You put 
yourself in a hole and you just 
want to get out. 
And I did.”

Eastern 

Michigan, 
though, 
seemingly 
tried 
every 

possible way to 
spoil 
Blanco’s 

masterpiece. 
Despite 
failing 

to capitalize on 
a deep fly ball, 
and multiple hitter’s counts, the 
Eagles still seemed destined to 
end the no-hitter. 

Freshman shortstop Natalia 

Rodriguez saw a ball bounce 
off the tip of her glove and into 
left field with two outs in the 
seventh inning, but the umpires 
around her ruled the play an 

error, keeping the bid alive long 
enough for Blanco to crush the 
next Eagles batter with three 
strikes. 

“I’m very hard 

on myself, so I 
expected 
that. 

It wasn’t really 
surprising, 
Blanco said. “As 
the game went 
on I was like, 
‘I need to do 
this more,’ but 
when the game 
finished, I could 
sit back and say 

that I actually did it, which was 
cool.”

Outside Blanco’s dominance, 

the 
Wolverines 
didn’t 
play 

particularly 
well 
— 
save 

for a few stolen bases. But 
perhaps the moment that most 
encapsulates the right-hander’s 
game came at the plate instead 
of the circle. Blanco corked a 
low hit off an Eastern Michigan 
fastball, which grazed the glove 
of an Eagles outfielder and 
gently whizzed past the right 
field foul pole for a home run. 

Like most of what happened 

during the game for Michigan, 
that hit could have gone against 
the Wolverines. 

It didn’t though. Call it good 

fortune or call it “God’s Plan,” 
but Blanco came through again 
for Michigan.

“Tera has just 
been such a

us.”

“I’m very hard

Though Michigan didn’t seem to play its best against the Eagles, Blanco’s strong perforance made all the difference

Keener secures starting catcher’s role midseason

For the Michigan baseball team, 

no position was more of a question 
mark coming into the season than 
catcher. Last year’s team had a 
program-high eleven draft picks, 
and one of them was senior catcher 
Harrison Wenson, who started 
126 games over the course of his 
Wolverine career.

The departure left a clear void 

in the lineup. Senior Brock Keener, 
sophomore Harrison Salter, redshirt 
freshman Marcus Chavez and 
freshman Joe Donovan battled for 
the position through the fall and 
winter. Teammates and coaches 
alike were impressed with all four 
players in the offseason.

“Harry, last year, was a fantastic 

catcher,” said senior pitcher Alec 
Rennard. “After he left, what I saw 
in the three guys that are returning 
— Brock, Harry Salter, Marcus and 

then the new kid, Joe Donovan 
— was just an absolute fire was lit 
from day one with them. I’ve just 
seen them all putting their best 
foot forward every day. I just think 
they’re pushing themselves to 
compete at their highest level.”

The competition lasted well into 

the start of the season. During the 
team’s spring break tour, they all saw 
time behind the plate, but Chavez 
was given the start in the first game 
of the season against Army.

“We had that pre-determined 

that Marcus was going to catch 
the first two and Salter was going 
catch on Sunday,” said head coach 
Erik Bakich at the time. “And Joe 
Donovan’s had mono for pretty 
much the entire preseason and 
Brock Keener (was) out for over a 
week with an illness as well.”

Bakich would continue to rotate 

through all four prior to returning 
to Ann Arbor. Chavez started six of 
the first 14 games, while Donovan 

and Salter started five and three, 
respectively. Keener, on the other 
hand, had seen ample time at first 
base during the trip, but had yet to 
make a start at catcher. The matchup 
against Lawrence Tech was that 
opportunity.

The senior, who may have been 

favored for the starting position 
coming into the offseason, has 
relinquished the position just twice 
since then.

Early 
on, 
Keener 
struggled 

defensively. He leads the other 
catchers in passed balls with nine 
and has the third-most errors on the 
team with four. Gradually, though, 
he 
became 
more 
comfortable 

behind the plate. His blocking has 
considerably improved as the season 
continues.

Offensively, Keener has also 

grown into his own. Of the four 
catchers, Keener’s .276 batting 
average is second only to Salter’s 
.314. He is also tied for third on the 

team in doubles and runs scored 
with four and 18, respectively.

Though it’s safe to say Keener 

has secured the starting spot for 
now, the other three catchers will 
certainly play a role as the season 
progresses.

Salter seems to be the go-to, 

second-string catcher during busy 
portions of the schedule. But if we 
know anything about this team, it’s 
that the coaching staff is willing to 
throw young players into the mix if 
necessary. The idea of playing the 
two promising freshmen, Chavez 
and Donovan, will not be abandoned 
entirely.

“I’d tell you that we have four 

legitimate catchers that could start 
at a lot of Division I programs,” 
Bakich said. “And instead of having 
competition where we are just going 
to pick one, we’re going to ask all 
four of them to contribute and add 
value every time their number is 
called.”

Despite big win, ‘M’ has 
room for improvement

In the first home meets of 

the spring season, the No. 6 
Michigan rowing team came 
out almost perfect for the 
weekend, winning 13 of 14 
events.

Facing No. 16 Indiana, No. 

11 Iowa and No. 18 Michigan 
State, 
the 
Wolverines 

performed to the expectations 
of 
Michigan 
coach 
Mark 

Rothstein, who, despite the 
dominant performance by the 
team, only saw room to grow.

“We 
are 

looking to get 
better each and 
every 
week, 

and 
I 
don’t 

think 
we 
did 

that this week,” 
Rothstein 
told 

MGoBlue.com. 
“In some events 
we did, and in 
some, we didn’t. 
We need to do it 
in every event, 
and we’ll get back to work on 
Monday.”

Though few, the areas that 

needed work were the most 
essential — the first varsity 
eight boats in both sessions. In 
the morning session, the first 
varsity eight boat took first 
with a time of 6:26.99, with a 
gap of just 1.82 seconds. In the 
afternoon session, however, 
Michigan took its first and 
only loss of the day with the 
first varsity boat against the 
Hawkeyes.

The performance by the 

first varsity eight boat wasn’t 
up to the Wolverines’ normal 
standards, as their boat not 
only performed slower than 
Iowa’s, but also both teams’ 
second varsity eight. With a 
time of 6:30.18, the first varsity 

eight boat was outdone by the 
6:17.80, 6:28.00 and 6:28.30 
posted 
by 
the 
Hawkeyes’ 

first varisty eight, Michigan’s 
second 
varsity 
eight, 
and 

Iowa’s second varsity eight, 
respectively.

“Today was good, up until 

the 
last 
race,” 
Rothstein 

told MGoBlue.com. “I didn’t 
think we raced really well, 
and Iowa is really, really 
good. That combination led to 
their victory by a substantial 
mark.”

However — outside of the 

subpar performances of the 

normally elite 
first 
varsity 

eight 
boats 

— 
the 
other 

boats 
carried 

their weights. 
Continuing 
from their tear 
the 
weekend 

prior, 
the 

first 
and 

second varsity 
four 
boats 

continued 

to dominate, sweeping the 
competition. With times of 
7:09.60 and 7:24.60 in the 
morning session, they won by a 
combined differential of 26.89 
seconds. The third varsity 
four additionally won with a 
time of 7:38.80, 15.61 seconds 
faster than the second-best 
Hoosiers finisher.

In the afternoon session, 

the Michigan varsity four 
boats found a way to top off 
their 
already 
commanding 

performance. Finishing with 
times of 7:18.20 and 7:18.1, 
the first and second varsity 
four boats beat Iowa’s by 
a combined 38.33 seconds. 
Both third varsity four boats 
for the Wolverines beat out 
Iowa to cap off a powerhouse 
performance.

“We are 

looking to get 
better each and 

every week.”

Coon weighing Olympics, NFL in life after a storied Michigan career

Over the past five years, it 

has been impossible to discuss 
the 
Michigan 
wrestling 

program without mentioning 
Adam Coon. Since his first day 
in Ann Arbor, the fifth-year 
senior has won over the hearts 
of the Wolverine faithful with 
his dominance on the mat 
and his genuine and strong 
personality off it.

Now, as he prepares to leave 

Michigan, Coon sifts through 
a world of opportunities. One 
of those opportunities, and 
arguably the most prominent, 
consists of sticking to what he 
knows and further developing 
his 
already-legendary 

wrestling career.

If Coon were to continue to 

wrestle, it would no doubt be 
in preparation for the 2020 
Olympic Games.

That preparation isn’t an 

unfamiliar process for the 
heavyweight, as he attempted 
to represent his country in 
2016. Dogged by a shoulder 
injury, Coon fell one match 
short of making the team. Now, 
with another year of collegiate 
wrestling under his belt and 
his health returned, this could 
be the chance for Coon to 
realize his Olympic dreams.

However, 
this 
time 
the 

road 
doesn’t 
lead 
through 

Ohio State’s Kyle Snyder — an 
Olympic gold medalist and 
two-time 
NCAA 
Champion. 

The 
wrestlers 
compete 
in 

different weight classes in the 
Olympics, as they sit 60 pounds 
apart.

Over the years, the Coon 

v. 
Snyder 
matches 
have 

been 
collegiate 
wrestling’s 

biggest gladiator showdowns. 
Wrestling three times in their 
last year of eligibility, the top-
ranked college heavyweights 
became familiar with each 
other on the mat. In their 
series, Snyder bested Coon, 
2-1, with Coon stealing a match 
from the Olympian in front of 

a record-breaking Michigan 
crowd.

Despite wrestling with a 

60-pound deficit, Snyder then 
stepped up when it counted 
most and defeated Coon to 
win the Big Ten and NCAA 
Championships. 
Now, 
Coon 
 

hopes to take the adversarial 
edge off their relationship.

After all, Coon has another 

foe to worry about if he wants 
to make it on the Olympic team: 
two-time 
NCAA 
Champion 

and 2017 World Championship 
bronze 
medalist 
Nick 

Gwiazdowski.

“I’d 
like 
to 
think 
that 

(Snyder and I) can be each 
other’s teammates rather than 
opponents,” Coon said. “But 
he’s most likely gonna make 
the team, and I have a really 
tough opponent in front of 

me to make the team. So, I’m 
hoping we can train together 
and learn from each other and 
we both get better. So, I hope 
we can be civil about it and 
stuff and not be each other’s 
opponent, but see how we can 
make each other better.”

Another option for the 285-

pound wrestler is football. 
Yes, you read that right. Full 
contact, professional football.

Due 
to 
his 
size 
and 

remarkable athleticism, Coon 
has been drawing the attention 
of some NFL teams who are 
interested in recruiting him to 
play offensive line.

While he didn’t play in 

college, Coon is no stranger to 
the gridiron. In high school, 
he was named an all-state 
linebacker his senior year and 
a two-time all-state honorable 

mention offensive lineman.

If he were to select the 

football route, Coon wouldn’t 
be the only collegiate wrestler 
to make the jump to the pros. 
Many NFL greats wrestled in 
either high school or college. 
Hall of Fame linebacker Ray 
Lewis was a two-time Florida 
state wrestling champion and 
all-pro fullback Lorenzo Neal 
was an NCAA Champion.

“It’s more just about seeing 

if there’s any interest, and then 
we’re gonna move forward if 
that’s the route I want to take,” 
Coon said.

Whatever he ends up doing, 

Coon 
will 
most 
definitely 

always 
have 
a 
home 
at 

Michigan. Departing as a two-
time NCAA runner-up and 
three-time All-American, it’s 
hard to imagine a greater face 

for the wrestling program. 
He has given wrestling fans 
plenty to smile about while 
serving as a role model for the 
next generation of Wolverines. 
As he leaves, he offers sound 
advice to the students who will 
occupy the Bahna Wrestling 
Center after him.

“Wrestling (in college) is a 

lot more mental than in high 
school,” Coon said. “It’s being 
able to put up with the grinds 
in the middle of the season 
and then just realizing that 
your life is not just wrestling. 
There’s a lot more to life than 
just wrestling and if your whole 
life is based on wrestling, then 
frankly, you’ve lived a sad life, 
in my opinion.”

Also beyond wrestling, Coon 

is an aerospace engineering 
student 
who 
is 
constantly 

trying to keep his mind sharp.

“I’d like to get into some 

kind of research or something 
just to keep the wheels going 
as well as develop stuff,” Coon 
said, “so when I do end up going 
for a career after this, that I’m 
not one of those guys that just 
wrestles or plays football, that 
I have those skills in place so 
that if I need to use them that 
I’m ready to go, that type of 
thing.”

Whether Coon decides to 

spend his next few years on the 
mat, on the practice field or in 
a cubicle, it is apparent he will 
give it everything he’s got. But 
for now, he just needs to pick 
a path.

“I know that what I want to 

do is finish up schooling here,” 
Coon said, “and then we’ll see 
where God takes me.”

With his Wolverines career behind him, Adam Coon graduates into an uncertain future, with multiple opportunities

After breakout year, tight ends primed for more

Sherrone Moore has never had 

this kind of depth in his meeting 
rooms.

The Michigan football team’s 

first-year tight ends coach went 
through a full season at Central 
Michigan with just two tight ends.

Now, he’s inheriting a position 

group chock full of talent.

“I’m extremely excited at the 

fact Coach Harbaugh loves tight 
ends that much,” Moore said

On last season’s offense that 

failed to impress in multiple areas, 
the tight ends were one of the 
Wolverines’ lone bright spots.

Junior Sean McKeon led the 

team with 31 catches and three 
receiving touchdowns and finished 
third on the team in receiving 
yards, with 301.

His position-mate, senior Zach 

Gentry, finished with 303 receiving 

yards and two touchdowns, both 
good enough for second on the 
team.

Needless 
to 
say, 
the 
pair 

combined to provide a spark to 
a passing game that otherwise 
struggled.

That duo returns for Michigan, 

and with questions and health 
issues surrounding other parts of 
the offense, Gentry and McKeon’s 
proven productivity will act as a 
safety blanket.

“Outstanding threats in the 

passing 
game,” 
Moore 
said. 

“Obviously, with Zach being (6-foot-
7), he’s a mismatch nightmare with 
his size, with his strength. And he’s 
265 right now, so he’s just getting 
bigger and bigger and stronger and 
stronger. And then Sean, he’s just 
so cerebral and strong … He’s so 
athletic.

“Both can play multiple positions 

in the group.”

Gentry and McKeon aren’t 

alone, either.

Junior Nick Eubanks looked 

promising in the Wolverines’ first 
game last season, catching two balls 
for 61 yards against Florida. But an 
arm injury sidelined Eubanks after 
just four games. Now, he’s back too, 
sporting a new accessory and all.

“Nick looks good,” Gentry said 

on Mar. 27. “Nick’s flying around 
and doing a lot of good stuff. Nick’s 
ready to go. He’s got the Gronk 
elbow brace on now.”

Senior Tyrone Wheatley Jr. 

is a bigger, more run-blocking-
oriented player, the foil to the rest 
of the unit’s finesse. Though he 
suffered a foot injury that has kept 
him out of spring ball, Wheatley is 
scheduled to return by the summer 
and provide a much-needed run-
blocking presence for an offense 
that struggled to pound the rock 
against good defenses last season.

That facet of the game is 

something all the tight ends have 

worked to improve. Gentry and 
McKeon, especially, have already 
proven themselves to be assets in 
the passing game. Now, especially 
for Gentry, the former quarterback, 
run blocking is emphasized even 
more.

“Really it starts with the run 

game,” McKeon said on April 
5. “When he switched over my 
freshman year, he couldn’t block 
anyone. I mean, honestly. But now, 
he’s bulked up. He’s 260 now. He’s 
moving people off the ball. So that’s 
been the biggest improvement with 
him. And he still has his speed too, 
his route running. He looks great 
out there.”

All the factors combine to give 

hope for improvement on a unit that 
didn’t leave much room to improve.

Moore joked Tuesday that he 

just learned the names of all the 
players in his meeting room.

It’s hard to blame him. It’s 

something he’s never seen before.

Turnovers, Rutgers ‘O’ 
kills Michigan’s hopes

Despite an inability to find 

the back of the net, the No. 18 
Michigan men’s lacrosse team 
looked like it could hold its own 
against a Big Ten powerhouse 
in No. 9 Rutgers. With three 
minutes to go in the first half, 
the Wolverines were down just 
3-0.

However, the game quickly 

unraveled. The Scarlet Knights 
scored five goals in the final 
three minutes, heading to the 
locker room with an 8-0 lead, 
which proved to be detrimental 
to Michigan as it fell, 16-8. Just 
as it did against 
No. 3 Maryland 
last 
weekend, 

Michigan 
dug 

itself a massive 
hole 
due 
to 

a lack of ball 
security 
and 

poor transition 
defense. 
The 

Wolverines 
turned the ball 
over 14 times, 
with seven of the giveaways 
coming before halftime. 

One 
particularly 
woeful 

sequence played out with 2:50 
remaining in the second quarter. 
Scarlet Knight Kieran Mullins, 
who scored eight goals in the 
contest, scored on a transition 
chance to put his team up, 4-0. 
Just eight seconds later, Mullins 
struck again, racing up the field 
after a faceoff win and rifling a 
shot to deflate a Michigan team 
that had looked full of life just 
moments earlier. 

“Rutgers, they go in spurts, 

and when you give a team, 
and such a talented team, 
opportunities like that, it can 
fuel their fire,” said Michigan 
coach Kevin Conry on Rutgers’ 
finish to the half. “They’re 
a very emotional team, and 

so they kinda felt their mojo 
going.”

The Wolverines didn’t fare 

much better after coming out of 
the locker room, with Rutgers 
scoring two more goals in the 
first 37 seconds of the third 
quarter to extend the lead to 
10-0. 

“Unfortunately we couldn’t 

come out of the locker room and 
hold off that blitz anymore,” 
Conry said.

While the game’s outcome 

was 
virtually 
decided 
at 

halftime, Michigan managed 
to find some bright spots in 
the game’s final frame, with 
freshman Kevin Mack and Alex 

Buckanavage 
spurring 
the 

offense late to 
lessen the deficit 
to eight.

“That’s 
who 

we are,” Conry 
said. 
“Those 

last 10 minutes, 
that’s the team 
that 
we 
know 

and love, and has 
potential to be a 

pretty special group.”

While 
the 
Wolverines 

showed promise with their late 
run, the team’s struggles with 
ball control and ball movement 
still 
remain 
a 
lingering 

issue, and Conry knows that 
Michigan must cut down on 
errors in one of the nation’s 
best conferences.

“If you make mistakes, the 

teams are gonna make you pay,” 
Conry said.

If Conry’s squad plays the 

way it did in the fourth quarter, 
the team could be the first in 
school history to clinch a berth 
in the NCAA Tournament. 
If the Wolverines play the 
way they did in the second 
quarter, though, this could be 
yet another season where fans 
wonder what could have been.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | APRIL 11, 2018

Students of theYear


T

he state of Michigan enacted a law requiring public 
high schools to give students CPR and automated 
external defibrillator, or A.E.D. training before 

they graduate, starting with the 2017-2018 school year. But 
LSA junior Tariq Mekkaoui is going one step further.

Mekkaoui views the state’s actions as a step in 

the right direction but knows they are missing an 
essential component: Mental health. He integrates this 
critical ingredient into Heal-Move-Shift, a nonprofit 
he co-founded in December 2017 that strives to teach 
students the three tenets of health: cardiovascular, 
mental and nutritional.

As an English and biomolecular science double major 

and an aspiring physician, Mekkaoui already had roots 
in the health science field. But a poorly-handled mental 
health incident involving a student in his hometown of 
Dearborn Heights is what actually sparked him to create 
Heal-Move-Shift.

“I was so upset, because I looked back at my own couple 

years in that community, and I was like, ‘No one spoke to 
me about mental health,’” Mekkaoui said. “No one spoke 
to me about how nutritional health can build on my mental 
health, or even cardiovascular health.”

Because of the incident, Mekkaoui realized it was time 

for change. With Heal-Move-Shift, he started working 
at Central Academy, a local Ann Arbor high school 
with a student body largely from immigrant countries. 
Mekkaoui, who is part Syrian, Lebanese and Palestinian, 
and his co-founder Ahmad Hider, a University of 
Michigan alum, wanted to focus particularly on this 
demographic group.

“We’re both from immigrant … populations,” Mekkaoui 

said. “So, we wanted to heal that community. We really 
wanted to shift the stigma away from mental health and 
these other health aspects and then move the conversation 
the correct way.”

Every Friday afternoon, when most students check out 

and prepare for the weekend, Mekkaoui heads to Central 
Academy to lead Heal-Move-Shift seminars for students. 
The programs range from CPR training to yoga lessons 
and meditation to discussions related to mental health. 
Students attend voluntarily, and Mekkaoui is pleased with 
the turnout.

“They’re all high-achieving students,” Mekkaoui said. 

“They’re phenomenal, and I love working with them. I 
honestly feel better when I go and teach these seminars, 
and I go ahead and relate to these students.”

With the guidance of the University’s Barger 

Leadership Institute, which Mekkaoui managed to get 
useful contacts and resources to help grow the nonprofit. 
Heal-Move-Shift earned a $10,000 grant from the 
institute, which will help it potentially expand into four 
high schools next year.

“We’ve moved fast, and we’re very proud of what we’ve 

done,” Mekkaoui said. “But also, it’s so important to pause 
and reflect and make sure that we’re doing this effectively 
and intentionally.”

Mekkaoui has big plans for the future. He hopes 

that one day, all high schools will offer mental health 
seminars for students since he feels it’s imperative for 
them to learn about mental health before graduating and 
being independent.

He also has goals for himself. Mekkaoui dreams of going 

to medical school, but he’s fine putting this off until later 
to focus on the organization. In fact, he plans to take a 
gap year after graduating to focus all his energy on Heal-
Move-Shift.

“I feel like I’m making a difference, and they’re 

understanding these high-level concepts without being 
forced to learn it,” Mekkaoui said. “It’s an easy introduction 
and they can carry this on with the rest of their lives. So, 
this is the work I want to do and I feel good doing it.”

STUDENTS 

of the 

YEAR

statement

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | APRIL 11, 2018

Activists. Innovators. Leaders. Community builders.

These three words can describe the seven students 

nominated by you — the University community — to 
be the Michigan Daily’s Student of the Year. But these 
words can hardly account for the countless hours of 
thought, the months of toil, the endless amount of 
passion each of these students have dedicated toward 
their work.

These are just a few of the students that push 

conversation and change within our university 
community and beyond. While their stories differ, 
each is driven by their own experiences to leave a 
positive mark on those around them. And for many of 
them, their work is just getting started.

These are your 2018 Students of the Year. Here are 

their stories.

Sincerely,

F

or LSA junior Meaghan Wheat, working with 
high school students was something she has 
wanted to do since she was in high school 

herself. So despite being a college student, Wheat spends 
a lot of time with high school students and teachers. 
In fact, she has facilitated conversations and leads 
workshops on social identities with about 430 teachers 
and many more students.

“High school students are at such a formative period in their 

lives,” Wheat said. “You can see their light bulb moments.”

Wheat was first exposed to the impact of dialogue when 

she was 16 years old. By participating in Summer Youth 
Dialogues through the University of Michigan, Wheat 
joined high school students from across the Detroit area 
for a series of conversations about race and ethnicity in the 
context of the city’s social systems and injustices. These 
conversations inspired her to create a dialogue-based course 
in her own school, Novi High School, which encouraged 
dialogues about gender, race, sexual orientation, class and 
religion among students.

Five years later, Wheat is now a consultant for Novi High 

School and will be a facilitator for Summer Youth Dialogues.

“Creating those types of spaces and being passionate 

about that work has sustained me,” Wheat said. “I’m really 
interested in the student voice — always have been.”

About a year ago, Novi High School reached out to Wheat 

because of her interest in these issues. They hired her to 
facilitate conversations between high school students 
and teachers through workshops. For the faculty, these 
workshops serve as part of professional development. For 
the students, they create a bridge between students and 
teachers by addressing disconnects between student needs 
and how teachers accommodate them.

Last summer, Wheat led 16 workshops in the span of two 

days for K-12 teachers. The workshops focused on lower 
socioeconomic status and cognitive ability.

“Novi is an upper-middle class suburb of Detroit,” Wheat 

said. “But not everyone in that community has a high 
economic status, so for teachers, how do we properly navigate 
that for students?”

Wheat has also worked with the Martin Luther King 

Children and Youth Program, helping middle school and 
high school students enact change in their own hometowns. 
She was nominated for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Spirit 
Award last semester. For Wheat, the most rewarding aspect of 
the nomination was getting to know other nominees.

“Meeting other people who do similar action-based and 

dialogue-based work was really fulfilling,” Wheat said.

Additionally, Wheat works with Metropolitan Youth 

Policy fellows to find out how the needs of young people in 
Detroit are, or are not, being met. The program serves to 
evaluate how well the city is supporting young people and 
whether young people feel they have a voice. Wheat has 
presented her findings at various conferences.

“We’re told we don’t know things that we know because 

of our age,” Wheat said. “I think that’s why I believe so much 
in students having a voice in their education system because 
we’re often left out of these conservations and these are 
conversations we deserve to be in.”

On campus, Wheat is also involved with Intergroup 

Relations, where she leads workshops on identities for student 
organizations and other groups. She is also a part of the group 
of students that is working to develop the Class and Inequality 
Studies minor.

Wheat is majoring in Political Science and Psychology, 

with a minor in Community Action Social Change. She has 
been pre-admitted to the School of Social Work, which she 
will attend after graduating next winter. In the future, Wheat 
wants to continue supporting student voices and social justice.

“I’m interested in both education and community organizing,” 

Wheat said. “So, I’m hoping to find a career path that does both, 
so maybe that’s consulting or maybe that’s teaching.”

DAILY STAFF REPORTER

“S

eeing inequality first hand and experiencing 
it, it brings your attention to these larger issues 
and it makes you sympathize with people who 

are going through different kinds of injustices,” Public Policy 
junior Lauren Schandevel said on her role as a student activist.

In just three years at the University of Michigan, 

Schandevel has created a money-saving survival guide, an 
organization dedicated to addressing the needs of low-income 
students and is in the process of creating a minor devoted to 
social class and inequality. Schandevel is a go-getter, not for 
herself, but for the community.

“I’m not a super ambitious person, in the sense that a lot of 

the work I do isn’t for my own gain,” she said. “I prefer to talk 
about it in the terms of the community and the specific policies 
that I’m tackling, and less about my role within facilitating that.”

Schandevel identifies as an activist by necessity. Having 

grown up in the Detroit suburb of Warren, a largely working-
class community, she is one of few students who come to the 
University from lower and middle-income backgrounds. At a 
university where 66 percent of the student population hails 
from the top 20 percent income bracket, Schandevel has had 
to navigate herself across situations that were uncommon in 
her hometown.

“A lot of the experiences that lower and middle-income 

students face kind of fall by the wayside when you have an 
overwhelmingly wealthy campus,” she said.

Schandevel 
created 
“Being 
Not-Rich 
at 
UM,” 
a 

comprehensive, crowd-sourced Google document on ways in 
which students and families can save money on campus. The 
document has gained widespread popularity with its large 
accumulation of student advice and comments.

“It’s been really cool seeing people coming together to 

write it because I feel like a lot of these resources are scattered 
throughout the University and it’s hard to find a place to 
centralize them,” she said.

As an expansion from the document, Schandevel and 

LSA junior Griffin St. Onge recently started the Michigan 
Affordability and Advocacy Coalition, a group dedicated 
to bettering the quality of life for low-income students 
by addressing issues ranging from renters’ rights, food 
insecurity and access to vaccines.

Seeing a need for resources that address individuals from 

lower socioeconomic statuses, Schandevel began to wonder 
why there wasn’t a space to study social class on campus. 
Together with LSA junior Meaghan Wheat, the two 
students gathered resources and support from University 
members to create a new minor called “Class & Inequality 
Studies.” The minor has yet to be approved, but according to 
Schandevel, it may be offered in fall 2019.

“Through the minor, I’ve talked to faculty who are really 

interested in the subject and don’t have a place to study it in 
a way that is interdisciplinary and intersectional,” she said. 
“When I’m gone, this minor will be a space for people to do 
that, something that will outlast me.”

Schandevel’s background has encouraged her to go into 

public service and politics, with the plan of helping others 
who have faced challenges similar to hers. She has even been 
nationally recognized for her work, earning a place as a finalist 
for the Harry S. Truman Scholarship.

Next year, Schandevel will graduate from the University 

and sees herself in the community. Schandevel said working 
alongside those whose passion for helping others will only 
amplify hers.

“Some of my biggest heroes are the community organizers 

and nonprofit managers,” she said. “People don’t even realize 
how much time, effort, energy and how much of themselves 
they put into it. That’s how you know they’re genuine and 
really care because they’re not working toward an elected 
office or a high paying job. They’re just doing the work because 
they think it’s the right thing to do.”

D

o you love being interrupted? 
Do 
you 
revel 
in 
people 

underestimating you? Does it 

warm your heart to see loud, aggressive 
or gross behavior? Then you are going to 
love this thousands-years-old concept: 
toxic masculinity!

The angry commenter
If you’ve been a loyal reader of 

this column, then you know that it is 
somewhat controversial. With that, I 
have a lot of haters, most of whom are 
unsurprisingly white men.

Here are some of my favorite comments 

posted on my previous columns:

“Here’s the summary: Blah, blah, 

whine, whine, blah, blah.”

“You’re 
very 
opinionated 
on 

something you admitted you don’t have 
any interest in, or know much about.”

“This 
is 
the 
most 
uninformed, 

unintentionally 
satirical, 
mind 

numbingly poorly thought out article I 
have ever read in my entire life.”

“While I mean to criticize your 

article I only mean to educate you on 
how misguided your article today was.”

And they say mansplaining is a myth.
The internal urge to correct someone 

on the internet always astounds me, 
especially when these comments are 
made by men. Who are these men? What 
causes them to feel the need to correct 
me? Do they not realize that this is 
satire? I await their answers to these 
questions in the comments.

It is also worth noting that many of 

these criticisms focus on what they think 
is my lack of knowledge or understanding 
on any given subject, when in fact I’m 
merely presenting my opinion on topics 
I’m well-versed in. Additionally, angry 
internet commenters are a weird (and 
personally amusing) part of a large issue 
of men feeling like they are smarter than 
women in the workplace, in academic 
settings and in life. It’s toxic, and not in 
a Britney Spears jam kind of way.

The man-child
I would like to kindly request that cis-

men stop doing the following in public: 
spitting, touching your crotch, peeing, 
other generally disgusting habits. Why 
is manhood associated with being dirty? 
How do body odor and poor hygiene 
prove that you are more of a man? Why 
is cleanliness a womanly thing?

Perhaps it is just my association with 

mostly college-age men, but the lack 
of household cleaning skills is really 
astounding. 
There 
is 
nothing 
less 

attractive than showing up at a man’s 
home to find dirty clothes on a floor 
that has definitely never been mopped 
or vacuumed. If you’re sitting or lying 
in a man’s bed, you are probably better 
off just not 
asking 
how 

long it’s been 
since they’ve 
washed their 
sheets. 
The 

lengths some 
men will go to 
avoid laundry 
both amazes 
and disgusts 
me.

I’ve 
heard 

horror stories 
about 
men’s 

bathrooms 
with 
toilet 

rings stronger 
and 
darker 

than the rings 
of Saturn. I’ve 
seen kitchens 
with 
dishes 

permanently 
encrusted 
with 
grime 

and 
living 

rooms 
littered with 
months-old beer cans.

Why does society allow men to be 

like this? Almost every college boy I 
met has an incredibly stunted maturity 
in terms of domestic tasks. Meanwhile, 
my parents had me doing dishes and 
sweeping since I could walk.

Next time you’re deciding between 

his place and yours, remember that no 
skincare routine can fix sleeping on 
that dirty-ass pillowcase.

I want, I want, I want
I once knew a white boy who was 

failing a class but was astoundingly sure 
that if he went to office hours he could 
cozy up to the professor and get his grade 
raised. Unsurprisingly, it worked.

Some days I wish I had the blind 

confidence of a white boy. To walk 
around not understanding the meaning 
of the word “no” must be freeing.

There’s a sort of indescribably yet 

subtle sense of entitlement that white 

men (especially rich ones) have. I do 
not know any women, people of color 
or members of minority groups who 
assume the way white boys do that they 
will, of course, land that internship or 
be selected for that position.

I have heard stories of a white man 

who lectured my female friend, saying 
that he has a superior understanding 
of what racism and sexism is because 
he is a white man.

One of the greatest embodiments 

of male entitlement is a made-up 
concept called the “friend zone,” in 
which men feel that all women they 
are nice to should have sex with them. 
The sense of entitlement to a women’s 
body ranges from the creepy, ruthless 

hitting on a girl 
to the nice boy 
“I talk to her 
and I am nice 
to her, how is 
she not in love 
with me?” ways 
of thinking. It 
even 
goes 
so 

far that women 
have repeatedly 
been 
attacked 

for 
rejecting 

men.

No 
woman 

should 
ever 

have 
to 
date 

you, have sex 
with 
you 
or 

even talk to you 
just because you 
are a man who 
did 
something 

you 
thought 

was 
nice. 
If 

you 
think 

otherwise, then 
you are part of 
the problem. 
I

t makes me happy that as a 
society we have mostly accepted 
the universal truth that men 

are 
trash. 
Women 
are 
constantly 

calling men out for their unacceptable 
behavior from humorous tweets to 
the more serious #MeToo movement. 
Men are no longer able to systemically 
adhere to problematic social norms 
like it’s the 1950s because they are only 
one viral tweet away from being the 
next meme. 

If you are a white man who believes 

you are not part of these issues as 
described, remember that there are 
many other reasons that men are 
toxic that I did not mention. If you 
still don’t believe that you are part 
of the problem, remember that the 
patriarchal system you are a part of is 
a legitimate issue and if you implicitly 
allow it to exist then you are still part 
of the problem.

actually going to coffee shops, I like 
writing this column because it forces me 
to think about place. What is “place” 
and its role in the way we perceive 
people, interact with space, document 
our 
experiences? 
I 
figure 
these 

abstract, impossibly rhetorical and 
pretentious questions are what I’ll be 
doing in grad school next year — here’s 
a test run, cheers.

I recently wrote a review for a 

performance by Nederlands Dans Theater 
and interviewed the artistic director. We 
spoke for about an hour in The Graduate 
hotel lobby, this choreographic genius 
and me, completely starstruck. He 
described the closing number of the 
triple bill, “Singulière Odyssée”, which 
is set in an art-deco European train 
station. He spoke about creating a dance 
with duets and partnering, relationships 
that tell a story without giving the 
whole story. That this was somewhat 
representative of life where you get a 
glimpse into someone else’s life without 
ever knowing the full story.

This got me thinking — coffee shops, 

airports, train stations, all the places 
we go to travel, to eat, to forget. I like 
to 
people-watch 
and 
catch 
myself 

eavesdropping, reading between the 
lines and filling in the blanks when I’m at 
coffee shops. It’s nostalgic in ways I can’t 
explain. It’s unfinished because we get 
such little information, but just enough 
to feel a part of something larger than 
ourselves, a part of a community.

A coffee shop, to me, is a window into 

the lives of people I would otherwise 
never interact with. I choose places, 
staying for hours on end, watching and 
listening, knowing that this feeling of 
uncertainty is where many of the best 
poets and novelists began their creative 
processes.

I think this is why I come to Literati. 

Above the Literati bookstore on East 
Washington, the coffee shop is a hub for 
writers, scientists, thinkers and lovers 
alike. I started coming to Literati the 
summer of my freshman year. I have a bad 
habit for wasting paycheck after paycheck 
on books that I could definitely rent from 
the library or borrow from professors 
for free. My parents got me a Kindle 
after paying $300 for my overweight 
luggage containing eight books for a 
three week dance intensive. From a 
logical perspective, I see the value of 
e-readers and appreciate their efficiency 
to some extent. But there’s something 
about flipping pages that defines a part 
of the reading experience. I’ve never 
been one to highlight, scribble in the 
margins, or even fold corners. My friends 
know I’m hesitant to lend books because 
my bookshelf is all unfolded, unmarked, 
unscathed. But that doesn’t mean I want 
to live paperless.

Literati Coffee sits above a bookstore 

which attracts readers of all types. 
The children’s books are on the second 
floor, right next to the espresso bar. 
Literati often brings in writers, local 
and nationally acclaimed, for readings 
and signings. The coffee shop houses 
many Michigan Daily reporters and 

columnists, 
myself 
included. 
I’ve 

had English professors advertise the 
events time and time again. Literati 
feels like a conduit of many sorts — 
connecting reader and writer, student 
and teacher, amateur and professional, 
person to person.

I’m convinced that a person is largely 

made up of their experiences. If reading is 
a highly condensed experience of another, 
then the more one reads, the greater 
one’s breadth of experience. Maybe it’s 

pretentious, but I find it impossible to 
be “worldly” or “empathetic” without 
having read the literature that is deeply 
embedded in our culture.

“A reader lives a thousand lives before 

he dies…the man who never reads lives 
only one,” George R.R. Martin said. I 
don’t usually like inspirational quotes 
because I feel like it’s a cop-out, but this 
is simply the truth.

Literati is a bookstore, primarily. They 

sell coffee and fresh pastries which makes 
it the perfect marriage — it’s delicious 
intellect. I choose Literati because I 
like to be surrounded by literature and 
espresso. I like the crowd it attracts and 
the way it makes me feel. The baristas are 
friendly and fun, well-spoken, what you’d 
expect from a place like this. It’s slightly 
disappointing that the coffee shop is now 
so popular that it’s hard to get a table on 
the weekends without coming when the 
doors open at 10:00 a.m. But I will say it’s 
worth it.

This place has been a passage, a train 

station, a launch pad for me. For the last 
four years, I have come to Literati to read 
and to write. It has seen me change, fall 
in and out of love, realize my passion for 
writing and healthcare, shape my future. 
It’s a place I can’t wait to come back to meet 
up with past professors, catch up with 
old friends, maybe my own book reading 
in the far future. It’s slowly dawning on 
me that I will be graduating, leaving Ann 
Arbor, and moving onto a new chapter of 
my life. I don’t know who, if anyone, reads 
this page in the Statement that I get to fill 
every other week, but thank you. I hope 
that if anything, you get to find places 
like this at-home feel, to think, feel, and 
process the ever-changing world we so 
temporarily occupy.

n her own words, Remi Murrey isn’t supposed 
to be at the University of Michigan. Born and 
raised in Detroit, her passion and sociability 

have driven her toward a career in broadcast 
journalism. As did many of her high school classmates, 
Remi set her eyes on historically black colleges and 
universities, specifically Howard University and its 
program in broadcast journalism.

“Howard was ‘that’ one,” Murrey told me, sitting, in 

a small meeting room in the basement of North Quad 
Residence Hall. But after acceptances to both Howard 
and the University of Michigan, scholarships made 
Ann Arbor an obvious choice despite the absence of a 
broadcast journalism program.

“When my mom and I did a tour here before 

Howard, I had a strong feeling that Michigan was the 
right place for me to be because it just felt at home,” 
Murrey said. “Howard was so far away.”

Despite a 21 on the ACT exam and a 3.5 grade 

point average in high school, Remi defied the odds 
of admissions. She eventually opted for a degree 
in communications studies in lieu of broadcast 
journalism.

“You know the credentials,” Murrey said with a 

wave of her hand. “However, I made it on the first 
round: boom, boom, boom. I wasn’t deferred — it was 
my essay and who I was as a person. I was like, ‘Ah-ha 
I made it!’”

And with her no-nonsense instincts and support 

from her parents, grandmother and her devout faith 
in God, Remi has continued to defy odds and “(make) 
boss moves,” both across campus and in her pursuit 
of broadcast journalism. Now, weeks away from 
graduation, she shares the anxious anticipation of all 
those with uncertain post-graduation circumstances, 

but when asked about her various roles during 
undergraduate career her expression asks, “You want to 
know it all?”

To be fair, there’s a lot to know. Remi has held 

secretary positions in Central Student Government 
and the Comprehensive Studies Program, The Inn at 
the Michigan League in addition to stints as a mentor 
for Pretty Brown Girl Club and a tour guide, all the 
while making pocket money in the University’s dining 
halls, first Bursley Residence Hall and then South 
Quad Residence Hall. But these are merely Remi’s 
side hustles. Her staying power is best displayed by 
her time at The Michigan Daily as a beat reporter, in 
Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., as a member and 
then as chapter president and, finally, as an intern 
with Detroit’s Local 4 News.

“Who can say they had an internship while taking 

classes and had multiple jobs and was the president of 
their sorority?” Murrey asked toward the end of our 
interview. “I didn’t let someone hold me back from my 
dreams, so I’m not going to let anyone hold me back from 
my future dreams because if I was able to make it here, I 
feel like I can make it anywhere. But, hey, that’s just me.”

Remi’s (well-earned) sense of pride is tag-teamed 

in and out by humility and a genuine appreciation for 
her opportunities and all those around her who make 
them possible.

“I just want to say thank you, that’s it,” Murrey said 

at the end of our interview. “Thank you to whoever 
nominated me. People may overlook this but I’m not. 
When I say I beat myself up sometimes … We all do. We 
compare ourselves to the next person who looks like 
they’re doing better, but if we just focus on ourselves 
and our own journey we can realize we are doing just 
as much, or even better, so thank you.”

hen I asked Akira Nishii, an LSA and 
Engineering junior, how it felt to be named 
a student of the year, he chuckled. He took 

some time to compile his thoughts before sharing that 
it felt good to be recognized for his efforts, but that he 
would not be where he is today if it was not for other 
people in his life — the professors and students who 
helped get him this far.

Nishii wants to build bridges between people and 

opportunities. Connecting people, both to resources and 
each other, is his passion.

Nishii’s motivation to build bridges can be traced back, 

at least in part, to his experiences as an international 
student from Japan. Like many international students 
on campus, he faces unique challenges. For instance, 
as an aspiring physician, he can only apply to certain 
U.S. medical schools. However, Nishii never wanted 
his citizenship to be a barrier to him so he got creative 
and built a bridge by beginning to translate Japanese 
into English. Now he translates TED Talks, and he 
guest lectures about audio-visual translation to Asian 
Languages and Cultures classes. Though it may not help 
him surmount the application barrier, he sees translation 
as a way to be proud of his roots while creating new 
opportunities.

When he started doing research in high school, Nishii 

treated his work as an intellectual venture. However, his 
feelings toward medicine and research changed after being 
diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, an incurable bowel disease.

“Even though being diagnosed with a disease isn’t a fun 

thing, at the same time, it gave me a new perspective,” he said.

Nishii understands research and development are 

expensive but also believes patients should not have to 
pay exuberant prices for treatment. Therefore, he is now 
interested in pursuing a medical degree and an MBA to 
bridge the gap between patients and the biomedical industry.

“I think I’m more interested in optimizing health care 

practices and research, more so than the research itself,” 
he said.

Nishii’s knack for building bridges is apparent upon 

examining the connections he has made while creating 
Perch, a platform that matches undergraduate students 
with research labs.

“It is very difficult for undergraduates to get into 

laboratories and so, currently, the primary means to 
reach professors is email, which can be discouraging to 
undergraduate students because either professors don’t 
check their emails or a lot of professors’ lab websites that 
currently exist are geared towards graduate students,” 
he said.

To facilitate the process, Perch uses an algorithm to 

match undergraduates and their skills to labs.

“So this is like LinkedIn meets eHarmony?” I asked.
“Kind of,” he admitted jovially.
Starting next year, the University’s Undergraduate 

Research Opportunities Program will be using his 
platform. Perch is also collaborating with the Chemistry, 
Biology and Chemical Engineering Departments 
to create a new research fundamentals classes for 
students. Nishii expects over 8,000 University students 
to be using Perch by next year. Perch has also been 
recognized as one of the top 32 student startups and 
has received attention from Sanjay Gupta, a prominent 
neurosurgeon and medical correspondent, and Jeff 
Arnold, the entrepreneur behind WebMD.

Bridges were even built during our interview as 

we discussed our shared interest in Orson Scott 
Card’s “Ender’s Game” and its much-maligned sequel 
“Ender’s Shadow.”

Nishii is building bridges, between students and 

professors, between Japan and America, between patients 
and medicine, and he is just getting started.

heyenne Travioli is more than just a leader in 
the University of Michigan’s Native American 
community. Though she’s a leader on Martha Cook 

Residence Hall’s Multicultural Council and a champion of 
underrepresented minorities, Travioli’s most remarkable trait 
isn’t just her academic and community excellence. Through 
her life, Travioli has shown a remarkable sense of wisdom.

Named after her reservation, Travioli is a member of the 

Cheyenne River Sioux tribe, part of the Lakota Nation. But for 
Travioli, like many other natives, these reservations aren’t a 
safe home.

“Not all reservations are the same, not all are as 

bad,” Cheyenne said. “There’s not many resources. My 
reservation, I haven’t gone out there since I was a little girl, 
because it’s pretty bad.”

As run-down as life on her reservation was, Travioli hasn’t 

forgotten because according to her, these poor conditions 
were due to a lack of awareness by the public.

“(Reservations) are put off in the corner,” Travioli said. 

“They were built that way so non-Natives wouldn’t have to 
interact with Natives.”

Because of her experiences, Travioli, an LSA senior, 

has designed her professional endeavors to further Native 
American causes. When she became chair of the Martha Cook 
Multicultural Society, Travioli used that opportunity to make 
a change.

“I decided to take hold of educating the girls within my 

dorm about Native American issues and the culture in general 
because I know Native Americans on campus,” she said. 
“We’re not really represented as much as I would like to see.”

With this goal in mind, Travioli threw numerous cultural 

and educational events in Martha Cook throughout November 
— Native American history month. She educated students on 
traditional regalia and served guests various teas with fried bread 
and “wojapi.” After gathering more people than she expected, 
Travioli fed her guests not just food, but also knowledge.

Outside of her roles at Martha Cook, Travioli is a board 

member of the LEAD Scholars program. Through LEAD 
Scholars, she collaborates with the Native American Student 
Association to further Native American representation on 
campus. With Martha Cook residents, LEAD Scholars, and 
NASA, Travioli organized a powwow — a Native American 
ceremony with feasting and dancing.

“I tried to advertise about this powwow, advertise about 

current Native American issues, and (raise awareness) for 
lectures through the American culture department,” she said.

Travioli’s efforts in educating students about Native American 

heritage has culminated in a History of Art major with minors 
in Museum Studies and Native American Studies. With these 
concentrations, Travioli is currently working on a project that 
fills in some of the blank pages of the University’s history.

“Under Professor Tiya Miles, we are looking through 

documents at the Bentley, and anything we can find in the 
Clements (William L. Clements Library) about Michigan’s 
Biological Station and it possibly being on stolen Native 
American land,” she said.

Travioli’s activism has extended outside of the University as 

well. She is a frequent contributor to Her Campus. Through Her 
Campus, Travioli supports not just Native American culture, but 
other cultures and “‘invisible” identities by sharing the wisdom 
she’s learned from her own tumultuous past. She teaches others 
to accept their damages and disabilities as a part of their identity.

After her time at the University, Travioli hopes to one 

day work at the National Museum of American History in 
Washington, D.C. where she’d like to expand upon Native 
American cultural exhibits.

“Throughout the years, if a museum featured Native 

American art, I always found myself a little disappointed 
because there’s only a number of artifacts compared to, say, 
the Islamic Department or African American Department,” 
she said. “What motivates me to be in the field is to make sure 
my people are represented well.”

J

ad Elharake has much to look forward to as a 
graduating LSA senior. He’s taking a gap year 
working at the University of Michigan Medical 

School, where he will look at health inequities through the 
Office for Health Equity and Inclusion. Next year, without 
the pressure of coursework, perhaps he’ll have more time to 
watch Real Madrid play soccer or practice dabke, an Arab 
folk dance he loves. But Elharake also has much to look back 
on, particularly within the communities he’s worked these 
past four years.

“It’s the communities that I’ve been a part of, it’s the 

support, it’s the going through the struggles with other 
students, that’s what I’ll miss the most,” Elharake said.

Being of an Arab-Muslim background, as well as being a 

first-generation student, Elharake has spent much of his time 
on campus devoted to empowering these communities.

“It’s the idea of one, the identities that I hold, but at the 

same time, it’s knowing that this institution is not built for the 
students who come from my communities,” he said. “That 
drive of changing this institution and changing campus for it 
to best fit my communities.”

Elharake was the host of Arab Xpressions, the Arab 

Student Association’s annual culture show, and is a diversity 
peer educator in West Quad Residence Hall. Another 
organization he’s part of is PILOT, a group focused on 
guiding students, primarily those who are first-generation or 
underrepresented, to become leaders on campus. Elharake 
serves as the undergraduate adviser in Pilot, where he works 
to inspire younger students on campus.

“Now, I’m empowering the next generation of students,” 

Elharake said. “It’s all about preparing for them for their next 
steps, what they will do on campus. What PILOT will do is 
prepare you to be a leader in your own community on campus.”

In addition to this work, Elharake has been active in 

working with the administration to help better support the 

Arab and Muslim communities. In 2015, Elharake and others 
pressured the University to acknowledge the Beirut terrorist 
attacks — an issue hitting close to home for Elharake, who 
immigrated from Beirut to Dearborn when he was seven. 
Eventually, Elharake, along with other students and faculty 
members, formed the Islamophobia Working Group, a group 
of students, faculty and administrators who meet monthly to 
address anti-Muslim and anti-Arab sentiments on campus.

Elharake is one of the main organizers of #WeExist, an 

initiative started in the Islamophobia Working Group. It’s a 
campaign to add a Middle Eastern/North African identity 
category to University documents. The team reached out to 
all three University campuses, meeting with administrators 
and garnering student support. Central Student Government 
eventually approved the category, and now Elharake is 
working with them to figure out implementation.

“We were thinking about how we have concerns and 

issues in our communities, but we don’t have data that 
backs that up,” Elharake said. “That’s where it all came 
about. The reason we don’t have data is because we’re 
not counted on campus.”

Though he will soon be leaving the University, he 

plans to continue his activist work through medical 
school and beyond.

“Taking this work, seeing how I can translate it into 

medical school, and then seeing how that can translate into 
my academic career,” Elharake said.

As an activist and a mentor, Elharake firmly believes in 

one’s duty to help and empower future generations. This is 
the advice he has for other students — more of which is to 
come in his commencement speech at graduation: 

“There are people who helped get you to where you are 

now, and played some type of role,” Elharake said. “It’s almost 
your responsibility for the next group of students. It’s the idea 
of paying it forward.”
