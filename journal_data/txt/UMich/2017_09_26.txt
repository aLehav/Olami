With a new initiative headed 

by Michigan first lady Sue 
Snyder, sexual assault on college 
campuses is set to face spirited 
bipartisan activism, as discussed 
at the third annual sexual assault 
prevention summit at Eastern 
Michigan University.

“We all must work together 

to create an environment where 
survivors feel safe and encouraged 
to be heard,” Snyder said.

Nearly 
500 
students, 

representatives 
from 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan 

Police 
Department, 
Title 
IX 

investigators, 
health 
care 

practitioners, university faculty 
and 
survivors 
attended 
the 

daylong summit that featured 
speeches and discussions by 
notable officials such as Gov. Rick 
Snyder and Rep. Debbie Dingell, 
D-Mich. Multiple small-group 
discussions were also offered to 
discuss topics such as masculinity, 
trauma and campus norms.

First lady Snyder released a 

handbook written by the sexual 
assault workgroup task force 
she organized in May. The 
handbook, which will also be 
released online, is geared toward 
survivors of sexual assault and 
aims to streamline the often 
tedious, overwhelming process 
of navigating options after sexual 
assault.

“Too often they don’t know 

what they can do, where to turn, 
what kind of help they can get, and 

this is going to be a great tool for 
them,” she said.

While prevention is often 

the focus of sexual assault 
activism, keynote speaker Dr. 
Rebecca Campbell, professor of 
psychology at Michigan State 
University, reiterated Snyder’s 
idea that post-assault care is 
important, but often neglected. 
She suggested everyone prepare 
positive social reactions that can 
help the survivor feel in control if 

ever trusted with the disclosure of 
a sexual assault.

“How 
you, 
me 
and 
we 

react to disclosures can have a 
profound effect on sexual assault 
survivors,” Campbell said. “It can 
affect if there will be any more 
disclosures made. Disclosures are 
like a stepping stone that could 
eventually lead to help seeking.”

First daughter Kelsey Snyder, 

an LSA senior, said Campbell’s 
words helped inspire her to 

become involved with sexual 
assault prevention. Kelsey Snyder 
expressed excitement for these 
education-based efforts. Having 
conducted many talks through 
the 
University’s 
Panhellenic 

Association, she found a large 
part of the sexual assault problem 
on campus stems from many 
students’ inability to recognize it.

“A lot of times, when I do 

presentations on the University 

Fifteen minutes away from its 

current location on Washtenaw 
Avenue, ground is breaking on 
the construction of the new 
Trotter Multicultural Center.

Students 
first 
began 

advocating for a new Trotter 
Center in 2013. In January 2014, 
the Black Student Union released 
seven demands to the University, 
requesting a space be made on 
central campus for students of 
color to gather and share their 
experiences at the University. 
After several years of meetings 
and proposals, in April 2017, 
the Board of Regents gave final 
approval for authorization to 
issue the project for contracts 
and bids.

Students at the Trotter Center 

thought the move presented 
both benefits and drawbacks. 
Information 
student 
Alieh 

Kimbeng said the move might 
bring a more diffused audience.

“People who make the walk 

actually want to be a part of 
Trotter,” she said. “You won’t

University Council, the body 

comprising representatives from 
each

on 

campus, convened its biweekly 
meeting Monday evening in the 
Michigan Union. Council members 
heard from guest speaker Efe 
Edevbie, Kinesiology junior and 
Central

Government 

Kinesiology 
representative, 
on 

recent racist incidents on campus.

“All of you are probably very well 

aware of some of the things that 
have been happening on campus in 
the last couple weeks, and I think 
that shows more than anything our 
responsibility as student leaders to 
take initiative and work on ways to 
remedy these situations,” he said.

He 
proposed 
a 
“Day 
of

which participants can discuss 
social issues and concerns. With a 
long-term goal of creating a more 
centralized

Edevbie 

encouraged the council to lead the 
initiative.

At 10:15 in the morning, the C.C. 

Little bus station was unusually 
empty.

In response to the racist 

graffiti on name tags in West 
Quad Residence Hall and recent 
responses from the University of 
Michigan administration, Black 
students associated with the 
#BBUM movement organized 
barricades on North University 
Avenue in an effort to halt the 
bus routes and disrupt the flow 
of a Monday morning at the 
University of Michigan.

The demonstration organizers 

posted non-Black allies at the 
intersections of Geddes Avenue 
and Church Street as well as 
Fletcher 
Street 
and 
North 

University 
Avenue 
just 
after 

9:30 am. Soon after, Ann Arbor 
police vehicles came to secure the 
barrier and redirect traffic away 
from the demonstration.

Black students camped out at 

the crosswalk in front of the C.C. 
Little bus station and the Natural 
History Museum with laptops 
ready to do homework.

LSA 
sophomore 
Travon 

Stearns, one of the three Black 
students whose dorm tags were 
vandalized with a racist slur, could 
not complete his assignments the 
day of the vandalism because he 
had to talk to campus police and 
respond to other inquiries from 
media and students. Because of 
this intrusion into his academic 
schedule, he said, he wanted to 
show the students who wrote the 
remarks and all students who are 
not involved with the cause what 
he felt like that day.

“Our mission statement for 

being here is they inconvenienced 
me when they wrote the N-word 
on my door deck,” Stearns 
said. “My plans for the day 
were completely ruined so the 
purpose for us being here is … you 
inconvenienced me for a day, I’m 
going to inconvenience you for an 
hour.”

Hundreds join Kaepernick-style kneel-in conducted by Rackham student Dana Greene

Responding to recent racist 

events on campus and a national 
controversy brewing around NFL 
players taking a knee during the 
national anthem, Rackham student 
Dana Greene kneeled at the block 
‘M’ in the Diag starting at 7 a.m. 
Monday morning. As of 9 p.m. on 
Monday, Greene remained on the 
Diag, with plans to complete a full 
24-hours of kneeling.

“I’ve been on this campus for five 

years, I did my undergraduate here 
and each year the campus climate 
has gotten worse and worse,” 
Greene said. “The recent election, 
the man who holds the highest 
office the land, the president of the 
United States (Donald Trump), has 
made this issue even worse.”

Close to 100 students, faculty and 

staff knelt with Greene throughout 
the day, with many more standing 
around the block ‘M’ on the Diag 
in solidarity. By the afternoon, 
protesters had two tents pitched 
above their heads and dozens of 

cartons of water bottles at their feet. 

University 
of 
Michigan 

President Mark Schlissel wrote in 
a statement that though he is off-
campus on University business, 
he supports Greene’s protest and 
will meet with him “as soon as he 
is back on campus.” Schlissel and 
Greene spoke by phone early in the 
afternoon. 

“I share with many the belief 

that our nation does not always live 
up to its highest ideals, including 
the equal rights we hold dear,” 
Schlissel 
wrote. 
“To 
me, 
the 

American Flag represents many 

things, including those very rights. I 
support (Greene’s) right to engage in 
peaceful protest.” 

Greene 
continued, 
adding 

Trump’s policies and responses 
have made it harder to be a Black 
person in the United States. 

“He’s made it harder for people 

who look like me and don’t look 
like me to walk this campus, to feel 
comfortable in our own skin and 
I’m here to tell him, and our own 
campus president that what we are 
dealing with is not OK,” Greene 
said. “It’s not right. If I have to sit

Students came to the 

University of Michigan earlier 
this month already excited 
for Oct. 7’s home football 
game against Michigan State 
University. But the buzz 
really picked up Monday 
morning when it was officially 
announced the game would 
have a 7:30 p.m. kickoff time, 
officially making it an “under 
the lights” game.

This is the first time 

Michigan has hosted a night 
game since 2014. There have 
only been three others in the 
Big House — one in 2011, one 
in 2013 and one in 2014. The 
Big 10’s new contract with 
TV networks gives control 
of game start times to the 
networks, rather than the 
schools involved. Before this 
change, the Michigan-MSU 
game was seen as immovable 
from its traditional afternoon 
start time.

Fans don’t seem to be upset 

about the change, though.

Engineering junior Rachel 

Fenberg said she was thrilled 
to find out it would be a night 
game, especially because the 
rest of her family are Michigan 
State fans.

“I’m very excited for the 

night game,” she said. “I grew 
up a State fan, so this was 
always a big game for me, 
with my family rivalry. And 
I’ve never been to a night 
game before, and I’m just very 
excited for the atmosphere.”

Although people are 

excited, many safety concerns 
surround the game. However, 
athletic director Warde Manuel 
told The Detroit News he’s 
confident in the University’s 
ability to host a safe night 
game.

“I think it’s different 

(than a day game) from the 
standpoint of increased staffing 

levels we need to have for the 
safety and fan experience of 
getting around,” Manuel said 
in August. “We add additional 
lighting to our parking lots. ... 
Obviously, the police forces, 
but the University, Ann 
Arbor, Washtenaw, the state 
of Michigan are in increased 
vigilance.”

There are other safety 

concerns besides the darkness 
and raucous fans, though.

“The longer people have to 

tailgate, you see more issues 
around alcohol and issues 
related to that, so that also is a 
concern,” Manuel said.

Fenberg agreed, saying 

she thinks her fellow students 
might get carried away in 
excitement.

“I think there will be 

more people who overdo it 
tailgating, because they’re 
probably going to start so 
much earlier than they’re 

used to,” Fenberg said. “Most 
students have never done it 
before and they won’t have a 
routine. But hopefully, things 
will go well.”

An additional concern 

affects many fans and students 
alike who are gearing up to go, 
but know it’ll come at a steep 
price. Twitter user LG posted 
a photo of his StubHub receipt 
for two tickets to the game. 
The total was $505.20.

Nov. 4’s Minnesota game 

was also rumored to be “under 
the lights,” but the networks 
can wait until 12 days before 
the game to decide on a kickoff 
time, so fans will be left 
speculating for a while.

“We’ll have to see how 

MSU goes,” Fenberg said. “But 
I think it would be really fun 
to have another (night game) if 
it’s not freezing out by then.”

ON THE DAILY: IT’S GONNA BE A NIGHT (GAME) TO REMEMBER

Matt Vailliencourt/Daily

Students block bus routes on North University Avenue in protest of recent racist incidents on campus Monday 

importance of bridging the gap 
between 
undergraduate 
and 

graduate students on campus.

“I think that in all programs, 

whether 
undergraduate 
or 

graduate, there’s something that 
I think we can benefit from from 
dialogue within our community or 
program,” she said.

Jawad gave voice to many 

students’ 
frustrations 
with 

racism and crime on campus, 
encouraging council members to 
facilitate conversation on possible 
solutions. Council members further 
discussed issues with the publicity 
of these incidents, examining how 
the University of Michigan goes 
about making students aware of the 

details of such incidents. 

Public Policy Rep. Samuel 

Lawrence, 
a 
Public 
Policy 

senior, 
expressed 
concerns 

with University officials not 
releasing information or alerts 
to 
students, 
specifically 
in 

regard to the issue of vandalism 
on the Rock.

“I would imagine that there 

are people higher up that don’t 
want that information being 
spread for a number of reasons, 
but I do think we as students 
have the right to know when 
things are defaced,” Lawrence 
said. “I wouldn’t have known 
about any of this (vandalism) 
had I not been at the right place 
at the right time, and I don’t 
think luck should determine 
how much you know about 
what’s going on on campus.” 

Pharmacy 
Rep. 
Kiran 

Vangipuram, 
a 
Pharmacy 

junior, expressed his hesitation 
with “politicizing events.”

“My dean at the College of 

Pharmacy did send out an email 
to the entire school,” he said.

Zingerman’s Deli hosts a paella party cookout Sunday.

was taking place in response to 
the racist graffiti written on his 
brother’s door in West Quad, but 
also to protest the name of the 
building, C.C. Little.

“We’re here today because my 

brother Travon, they targeted him 
because of his ethnicity. We’re here 
today because they stopped us from 
trying to learn so we’re … trying to 
study,” Felten said. “Another reason 
we shut down C.C. Little is because 
it’s a racist institution. It’s racist.”

The name C.C. Little has been 

hotly debated in recent months at 
the University. Earlier this month, 
a group of University professors 
and a student submitted an official 
request to change the name of the 
building.

“How would if you were going 

to say, if you were Jewish, and you 
say, ‘I’m going to Adolf Hitler bus 

stop.’ That’s not cool,” Felten said. 
“For Black people, this is not cool 
because if our great grandparents 
had to deal with him, we wouldn’t 
be here right now.”

Students attempting to board the 

bus lined up at the C.C. Little station 
en masse, waiting for a bus to take 
them to North Campus.

Postdoctoral 
fellow 
Austin 

McCoy, a veteran organizer and 
attendee at the blockade, said the 
students waiting for the bus were 
what made the protest so effective 
in spreading the cause of #BBUM 
and #SchlisselWya to the entire 
campus.

“I think (the halting of the bus 

routes) is part of the lesson: to 
get other students who may not 
be thinking about issues of racial 
inequality 
to 
understand 
how 

racism inconveniences Black people, 
especially on campus,” McCoy said.

While most MBuses and city 

buses could not gain access to the 
road, the protesters cleared the way 

for an ambulance halfway through 
the demonstration.

Felten discussed the number of 

Black students at the University 
and how he sees it as a problem, 
especially in a country with a much 
higher proportion of Black people.

“There’s not a lot of us here. We 

can go all day walking on campus 
and not see another Black person,” 
Felten said. “This doesn’t really 
affect us on a physical level but 
psychologically this does affect us 
and hurt us.”

Studying on campus can be 

difficult, Felten said, when there are 
so few students that look like him.

“You don’t want to study in a 

space with people that don’t look 
like you,” Felten said. “I don’t feel 
safe going to Shapiro because I don’t 
know how a white person might 
perceive me. They might just have 
the gut to say the N-word to me, but 
I’m going to stay strong. I’m here for 
a reason, I have a purpose in life.”

North Campus buses such as 

the Bursley-Baits bus changed 
their routes to pick up students on 
Church Street instead of North 
University Avenue so students could 
still get to class, but these students 
still felt Travon’s message and the 
point of the demonstration.

Engineering senior Dulce Rios 

was waiting at C.C. Little at the 
time of the protest for a bus to take 
her to North Campus. After talking 
with the Daily, she found out there 
wouldn’t be a bus coming to the 
C.C. Little stop.

“I mean, I think the point 

of protest is to disrupt other 
people’s daily lives, right?” Rios 
said. “Because they’re protesting 
because their daily lives are 
disrupted so I think they’re being 
pretty effective if you ask me.”

Other students waiting for 

buses weren’t as receptive to the 
action that disrupted bus routes. 

Engineering 
sophomore 

Bogdan Manga was waiting for a 
bus at the time of the protest to get 

to a class on North Campus.

“I respect what they’re doing 

but I don’t think the academic 
process 
should 
be 
impeded 

because I want to go to class,” 
Manga said. “I’m fine, I’m not mad 
or anything.”

Along with the ambulance 

and a few buses, the protesters 
also allowed LeRoy Whipple, the 
owner and operator of the Whips 
Dog Days hot dog stand, to pass 
through and set up his cart in 
front of the Chemistry Building. 
He said the protesters are allowed 
to demonstrate and would hold up 
city buses as well.

“They have the right,” Whipple 

said. “It’s definitely going to hold 
the bus systems up and put them 
behind schedule. The AATA, the 
ones that run through the city, 
they can’t get through here, so 
that’s going to impact the city 
too.”

About 
10:45 
am, 
students 

at the C.C. Little crosswalk 

stood up from their homework, 
gathered themselves in a circle 
and chanted and sang. After the 
main demonstrators dispersed, 
representatives 
were 
sent 
to 

relieve the allies blocking the 
major intersections with the 
police from their posts, signifying 
the end of the demonstration.

Stearns said the purpose of 

the protest was not to sit with no 
purpose and cause stress for those 
trying to use the buses. He said 
the constant roadblocks keeping 
students from classes and doing 
homework, such as the name tag 
incident, is what Black students at 
the University experience every 
day.

“We’re not just doing this to 

be jerks or things of that nature,” 
Stearns said. “We have an end goal 
in mind. We’re really doing this so 
you can hear us, hear the issues 
that we have on this campus. This 
is what it’s like to study at the 
University of Michigan.”

feel like if it’s on State Street it’s 
just going to be like ‘Hey, I’m just 
walking into Mason Hall’ and 
you’re not really going to have 
those conversations. But people 
who actually walk here (now), 
then they’re going to want to talk.”

LSA senior Catherine Daoud 

attested 
to 
the 
increasing 

importance of wanting to talk, 
especially with a number of 
racially-charged 
incidents 

happening on and around campus 
in recent years, including racist 
writing that occurred as recently 
as last weekend.

“The students that come here 

to organize these protests, they 

utilize our space to write down 
their demands, write down what 
they want to be done,” Daoud said. 
“People will host meetings on how 
to tackle this racist incident or this 
racist remark that just occurred, 
or they will just come in and 
have discussions and have that 
dialogue that needs to be done.”

She added the move could have 

made protests like Monday’s even 
more centralized.

“The (protests) on the Diag, 

if we were closer, we would be 
having a dialogue discussion 
about it,” Daoud said.

The move, though, comes 

with logistical implications. The 
new building is slated to be in 
front of the Betsy Barbour and 
Helen Newberry residences, just 
north of the Kelsey Archaeology 
Museum, 
the 
LSA 
building 

and 
the 
Michigan 
Union. 

Construction has closed half of 
State Street’s southbound lane 
and the sidewalk.

Susan Pile, senior director of 

University Unions and Auxiliary 
Services, said she thinks the 
construction on State Street, 
though a disruption, has made 
minimal impact.

“I 
don’t 
think 
(the 

construction) will really have an 
impact on the Union,” she said. 
“It’s far enough down the street 
that we’re not anticipating it’ll have 
any impact on pedestrian flow 
and parking and that sort of thing 
because the street is still open and 
the sidewalk is open, just kind of 
across the street.”

The Office of Public Affairs 

declined to comment at the time 
of publication.

of Michigan’s campus, especially 
to Greek life, I’ll go into a fraternity 
and say, ‘What is sexual assault?’ 
and a lot of them can’t tell me a 
definition of it because they’re 
unaware of certain things that fall 
into that category,” Snyder said. 
“Education is like the baseline of 
what we’re trying to do.”

Kelsey Snyder is the director 

of the Panhellenic peer educators 
who organize the Speak Out for 
Greek life that provides an open 
forum for survivors to share their 
stories.

“I am really proud of Kelsey 

stepping up and the role she’s 
played. As you’ve heard she’s gone 
to fraternities to talk to young 
men about this issue,” Gov. Snyder 
said. “I mean, that’s the kind of 
involvement we need.”

Some 
lawmakers 
were 

concerned when U.S. Secretary of 
Education Betsy DeVos issued new 
rules requiring a higher standard 
of evidence for sexual assault cases. 
Additionally, 
Trump 
recently 

removed a report of sexual violence 
from the White House website. 
The Obama-era report was often 
used as a resource for those doing 
research on sexual assault.

“I don’t have a fear and I hope 

it comes together well. I’ve talked 
to Betsy DeVos and I’ve shown 
her what we’ve done in the state 
and I told her we are a resource 

for whatever she may need,” Sue 
Snyder said. “I honestly don’t think 
it’s going to hurt. I think it will 
help.”

EMU sophomore Joheny Yanes 

agreed with Kelsey Snyder in that 
Campbell’s words hold a lot of 
weight.

“I think it is great to be able to 

listen to politicians’ words, but 
since Campbell is a researcher, she 
had like firsthand experience with 
survivors, and their stories are 
often the most moving,” Yanes said.

Many campus-level initiatives 

are taking place due to funding 
granted to the University by the 
state to prevent sexual assault –– 
Sue Snyder said Michigan is the 
only state which allocates general 
budget dollars to this effort. But 
additionally, the state legislature has 
introduced legislation with many 
of the same goals, largely due to 
the female representatives on 
the appropriations committee.

“We are making sure that 

survivors have access to their 
medical records when they do 
seek treatment and go through a 
rape kit,” Sue Snyder said.

State 
Rep. 
Kristy 
Pagan, 

D-Canton, said the legislation, 
known as the Sexual Assault 
Victims’ 
Medical 
Forensic 

Intervention and Treatment Act, 
will provide funding to medical 
care and forensics teams that 
work on sexual assault cases, 
while ensuring survivors have 
access to counseling.

Additionally, 
Rep. 
Debbie 

Dingell said they are working 

on funding a sexual assault kit 
tracking system that would 
allow survivors to know exactly 
where their kit is in the criminal 
justice process, whether it be 
the prosecutor’s office or a lab. If 
they are successful in allocating 
the funds, Michigan would be 
the first state in the country to 
provide kit tracking.

Campbell 
explained 
many 

victims of sexual assault refrain 
from disclosing the crime in fear 
that their inebriation during the 
assault would place blame on 
them or make them vulnerable 
to minor in possession offenses. 
State Sen. Tonya Schuitmaker, 
R-Van Buren, however, said the 
women on the panel wanted to 
rid survivors of as many worries 
as possible.

“We amended the law so that 

minors who had been drinking 
and were getting a sexual 
assault exams would not be 
getting a minor in possession,” 
Schuitmaker 
said. 
“Sexual 

assault is the top priority of the 
situation and we didn’t want 
survivors to have any barriers.”

With the support of attendees 

and 
bipartisan 
political 

leaders, Dingell said the state 
and federal governments will 
continue advocating for the 
safety of college campuses and 
empowerment of survivors.

“I remember what it was 

like to be on college campus. 
I remember the shame, the 
trauma. We cannot go back,” she 
said.

here until my knees bleed, then 
that’s what I’m going to do.”

In a letter addressed to Schlissel 

that circulated around the Diag, 
Greene traced his experiences 
with racism in his five years on 
campus. 

“I have crossed the fountain 

in Ingalls Mall as an incoming 
freshman and as a graduate,” he 
wrote. “I have watched as anti-
Muslim, anti-Black, anti-Latinx, 
and 
anti-immigrant 
rhetoric 

has raced across our campus 
and across our country...I am no 
longer numb but instead I will 
use this moment in time to make 
a statement.” 

E. 
Royster 
Harper, 
vice 

president for student life, said she 
was proud of the students who 
were protesting that morning. 

“I think that (I am proud of), 

not only the student who chose 
to take a knee, but also all the 
students — how they feel about 
equality in our country and 
also at our University. I am just 
glad to be here to be in support 
and make sure everything goes 
well. I couldn’t be more pleased, 
actually,” she said.

She also touched upon how 

the University is responding to 
student concerns. 

 “I feel like we’ve been 

responsive in terms of showing 
up and talking to students,” she 
said. “I think that what we do in 

the next two weeks is not really 
the answer, it’s what we do after, 
because this is long-term work, 
and it’s work we’re going to have 
to do as a community. There’s 
nothing you can do short-term 
about a long term problem, and 
racism is a long-term problem. We 
all just have to keep working on it. 
So this gives me hope that we can 
do that together.”

Last year, Colin Kaepernick, 

former quarterback for the San 
Francisco 49ers, was the first 
professional athlete to take a 
knee during the national anthem 
to draw attention to anti-Black 
racism and police brutality in the 
United States. Trump blasted 
Kaepernick in a speech this 
weekend, telling owners to “get 
that son of a bitch off the field 
right now.” 

“What Colin Kaepernick did 

last year, taking a knee, wasn’t 
to disrespect the troops. In fact, 
I think I’m honoring the troops 
right now because they gave me 
the right to do this. My father 
served in the military, and … this 
isn’t disrespecting the flag, this 
is honoring it,” Greene said. “If 
Black people can get killed in this 
country and not get any justice for 
their lives, for their murder, then 
that’s disrespecting the flag.”

Following the white nationalist 

groups protesting the taking 
down of the statue of Robert E. 
Lee, a Confederate general, in 
Charlottesville, 
Va., 
President 

Trump blamed “all sides” for the 
violence that occurred, which 

received a great deal of backlash.

“If the president of the United 

States 
can 
equate 
peaceful 

protesters with KKK members and 
the alt-right, that is disrespecting 
the flag,” Greene explained. “This 
is not disrespecting the flag, and 
I’m doing this for every student 
on this campus that has ever felt 
like they didn’t belong here, any 
person in this country who felt 
like they didn’t belong here.”

In the morning, Greene said 

he was surprised Schlissel could 
not come to the Diag. Throughout 
the 
afternoon, 
administrators 

including E. Royster Harper, vice 
president for Student Life; Provost 
Martin Philbert; Dean of Students 
Laura Blake Jones; and Chief 
Diversity Officer Robert Sellers 
stood at the edge of the Diag. 

“I’ve been out here since 7 

o’clock, it’s damn near 90 degrees 
out here, the president of the 
campus ain’t even showed up. 
So how much is my life worth?” 
Greene said. “He can come out 
here, but that’s not going to send 
me home. That’s a start.”

Many ordered rounds of pizza 

to the protestors, and Counseling 
and 
Pyschological 
Services 

distributed yoga mats to those 
kneeling. 

Central Student Government 

President Anushka Sarkar, LSA 
senior, tweeted solidatory with 
students protesting.

A

fter moments of impact, 
when 
experiencing 

a 
situation 
of 

uncomfortableness and physical 
unawareness, 
our 

thoughts 
directly 

affect our personal 
perspective on the 
world around us. 

It was sunny and 75 

degrees in Ann Arbor 
as I walked to Literati 
on a busy Wednesday 
afternoon 
to 

complete a professor’s 
requirement. I don’t 
usually 
make 
it 

down to that side of 
town, and the new places and 
faces I discover always amaze 
me. As I saw Literati in the 
distance, the little shops I had 
never seen before commanded 
my full attention. Enthralled by 
the figurines in the windows of 
a new-age vintage shop, without 
warning, I was shoved by an old 
man walking past me. He clearly 
saw me walking down the street, 
and instead of getting out of 
my way, he decided to disrupt 
my pleasant stroll and literally 
knocked me off my feet.

I immediately said, “Oh my 

gosh, I am so sorry!” as if it were 
my fault that we ran into each 
other. I looked back and saw him 
shaking his head in reaction to 
the stupid college student he 
perceived me to be. I will never 
be sure if I was the cause of this 
unpleasant physical encounter 
because I truly was not paying 
attention. I contemplated why 
this man did not step out of his 
way and was so frustrated that it 
shook me to my core. I felt awful 
walking away, thinking that it 
was my fault he ran into me.

Looking back, I can’t change 

the fact that he ran into me 
so abruptly. I found myself 
immediately thinking as I got to 
Literati, that I should not let this 
one man’s horrible action ruin my 
day. I realized that my response 
to this telling incident is far more 
important 
than 
overreacting 

about it. What could I do after 

the fact? Nothing. It wasn’t 
worth stressing over.

The experience I had that day 

on East Washington Street was 

a 
very 
culminating 

experience 
for 
me. 

Standing in the essay 
section 
at 
Literati, 

I found books that 
shared 
experiences 

of hurt, trauma and 
depression. 
After 

reading the blurbs 
about the authors’ 
experiences writing 
their 
books, 
and 

what 
they 
were 

about, things began 

to become very clear for me. 

These authors shared their 
wisdom about their journey 
through 
hard 
times. 
And 

the messages, no matter the 
background 
of 
the 
author 

or the genre of book, always 
came back to the same clear 
message: The only thing we 
have control over in this life is 
ourselves. We must take action 
and educate ourselves about 
making 
good 
choices, 
and 

reacting to tough situations in 
a way that is productive and 
meaningful.

College is a time when we 

often feel that everything we do 
is essentially for someone else. I 
have to study to do well, or else my 
parents will cut me off. I have to 
join at least two extracurriculars 
so that a job recruiter will think 
I am involved. I have to go to 
the career fair because if I don’t, 
Sally will get a better job than 
me, and she isn’t even smart! Do 

I go to the fraternity party so I 
can prove to my friends that I’m 
definitely not “lame” and can 
have a good time, or do I take 
care of myself and sleep?

A lot of the times I have to 

ask myself, “Is what I am doing 
what I really want to be doing?” 
Life is too short to live it for 
someone else. Doing things in 
spite of others wastes time and 
energy you could be devoting 
to a true passion. When you 
have the ability to control your 
life and still choose to focus it 
on pleasing others rather than 
yourself, you are going to walk 
away from these four years 
with regret.

Dwelling on the moments 

we cannot control is truly 
unproductive. So instead of 
getting frustrated by the student 
that just hit you on their bike, 
or took your seat in lecture, 
remember that our reactions 
to these situations are the only 
things we can control.

If we constantly react to 

things in a way that is outlandish 
and 
uncontrollable, 
we 
are 

doing a disservice to ourselves. 
Instead of consciously choosing 
to focus your thoughts in a 
productive way that brings 
awareness to the situation, you 
are choosing to instigate your 
opponent and, again, use your 
hard-earned energy on someone 
else that could be better spent 
caring for yourself.

We all came to college with 

the intent to leave here with 
a new set of skills and to be 
able to think critically is one of 
the many things we will take 
away from a college education. 
However, we have to remember 
to think critically even if we are 
not overtly prompted to do so. 
We must assess the situation, 
think about what is in our best 
interest and focus our thoughts 
on our own reactions. At the end 
of the day, the only person you 
can control is yourself.

 Walking with your thoughts

MICHELLE PHILLIPS | COLUMN

S

uicide. 
A 
word 
that 

is 
uncomfortable 
for 

many to say because of 

the associated stigma, so it is 
exchanged for other words, or not 
said at all. 

Suicide. A word that many 

people on this campus have a 
personal connection to, whether 
because a loved one has attempted 
or died by suicide, or because of 
their own struggles with mental 
illness.

Suicide. A word we need to 

stop avoiding and to start talking 
about more. A word around which 
we need to send silence packing.

For me, the word suicide 

hits close to home. I have been 
hospitalized twice in the past year 
for suicidal thoughts. One of these 
hospitalizations was nearby, at 
Michigan Medicine, Ward 7C. It is 
part of my memory of Ann Arbor. 
I clearly remember the locked 
doors, the 15-minute checks and 
the hospital food. I also remember 
the kind nurses and the bonds I 
formed with fellow patients.

Yet, I know I am not the only 

University 
student 
who 
has 

struggled with these thoughts 
or been hospitalized. Suicide 
and suicidal thoughts are all too 
prevalent on college campuses. 
Each year, 1,100 students die by 
suicide on college campuses. It 
should also be noted that you 
don’t need to be hospitalized or 
have made an attempt for your 
experience and pain to be valid. 
All suffering is suffering.

It’s well known that mental 

illness and suicide are huge 
problems on college campuses. 
So, what do we do to make a 
difference?

There are many ways everyone 

can 
make 
a 
difference 
in 

decreasing suicide. Here are just 
a few ways:

1. Say the S-word.
Suicide. 
Yes, 
it 
can 
be 

uncomfortable to talk about, 
but with practice it becomes 
less uncomfortable. There is a 
misconception that talking about 
suicide will give someone the 
idea. We can save lives by talking 
about it.

2. 
Be 
mindful 
of 
your 

language.

Think twice before saying, 

“That makes me want to kill 
myself,” when you really mean, 
“That makes me frustrated.” 
Offhand comments like this make 
light of suicide and diminish the 
gravity of when someone truly 
means they are suicidal. We 
become desensitized and as a 
result, when someone reaches 
out for help, we might mistake it 
as a joke.

If, of course, you are suicidal, 

then 
definitely 
express 
this 

to someone you trust or to a 
professional (see online).

3. Show respect with your 

choice of words.

It is outdated to say “commit 

suicide,” and it is preferred to 
say “died by suicide.” The phrase 
“commit suicide” stems from a 
past where suicide was a criminal 
offense. By changing how we talk 
about these tragic deaths, we are 
acknowledging that these laws 
have fortunately changed, and 
people with mental illnesses are 
treated with more dignity now.

4. Ask if someone is OK.
It can be hard to tell if 

someone’s comment is a joke 
or real. It is safer to ask if 
someone is OK and to do this 
every time you hear something 
concerning. Most people who 
attempt suicide communicate 
their plans to someone in 
advance. 
Your 
questioning, 

though it may be awkward, 
could save someone’s life.

5. 
Know 
the 
resources 

available (see online).

Familiarize 
yourself 
with 

what is available on campus and 
beyond. Put emergency numbers 
and hotlines in your phone. You 
may need these one day for a 
friend or for yourself. Taking care 
of yourself is just as important, if 
not more important, as taking care 
of others.

In addition to being mindful of 

language, mental health awareness 
events are also important. Active 
Minds, a student organization on 
campus I am proud to be a part of, 
is aiming to start a conversation 
about suicide on college campuses. 
We want to send silence packing, 
literally. On Oct. 10, from 9 a.m. to 
4 p.m., the Diag will be filled with 
1,100 backpacks, each backpack 
representing one of the college 
students who die by suicide each 
year. Several backpacks will also 
have personal stories attached to 
them, memorializing real students 
who have unfortunately passed. 
The project, Send Silence, is put 
on by the national Active Minds 
organization and tours college 
campuses across the country.

I encourage you to spend some 

time Oct. 10 walking through the 
Diag and reading these stories. 
Spend some time looking at the 
sheer number of backpacks and 
let the tragedy of those numbers 
sink in.

The 
Send 
Silence 
Packing 

event will likely be emotionally 
overwhelming for some. If that is 
the case, make sure you take care 
of yourself first and foremost. 
Practice self-care. Reach out for 
professional help, if necessary. 
And, most importantly, end the 
silence by talking to someone you 
trust.

In an ideal world, zero students, 

or people in general, would die by 
suicide each year. That may not 
be our reality yet, but through 
personal changes and events that 
raise awareness, such as Send 
Silence Packing, we can get closer 
to that reality every day.

FROM THE DAILY

 Prioritize and protect survivors
I

n an anecdote-laden speech on Sept. 7, Education Secretary Betsy 
DeVos outlined perceived problems in Title IX policies, including 
the lack of due process for those accused of sexual assault. On 

Sept. 22, DeVos announced the Department of Education would be 
rolling back on Obama-era policies addressing sexual assault on 
college campuses. Her remarks have been met with negative reactions 
from various politicians and organizations who consider her plans 
insensitive to survivors of sexual assault and misinformed on the 
prevalence of assault on campuses. The Michigan Daily Editorial Board 
believes that DeVos’s rollback unfairly shifts the conversation away 
from the survivors and detrimentally frames a humanitarian issue as 
partisan. We urge universities to prioritize the welfare of survivors 
when enacting sexual assault policies on their campuses.

Sexual 
assault 
on 
college 

campuses has been a focal point 
in policy and the news recently. 
Much of this focus is due to the 
increased risk of sexual assault on 
college campuses. According to a 
report by the Justice Department 
in January of 2016, one in five 
women are sexually assaulted 
while in college. Seven percent 
of men in the study reported 
being victims of sexual assault. 
In 2015, the University released 
the results of a campus climate 
survey, 
which 
showed 
that 

roughly 11 percent of students 
on campus — including female, 
male, graduate and undergradute 
students — reported “some form 
of nonconsensual sexual behavior 
during the past year.” University 
policies on sexual assault have 
been the target of increased 
scrutiny and revision following 
an increase in the number of 
complaints from survivors and 
the accused. 

In 
2011, 
the 
Obama 

administration 
attempted 
to 

make headway on the issue by 
releasing the “Dear Colleague” 
letter, outlining the standards 
universities 
should 
meet 

regarding sexual assault policy. 
The “Dear Colleague” letter also 
clarified how the administration 
intended to interpret Title IX 
legislation in regard to cases 
of campus sexual assault. It 
includes a section that calls 
for universities to require a 
“preponderance of the evidence” 
standard when analyzing sexual 
assault cases. Preponderance of 
evidence more likely favors the 
complainant, which DeVos has 
taken issue with.

In her speech, DeVos spoke 

at length of the violation of 

due process this clause causes, 
specifying 
it 
was 
unfair 
to 

those accused and that it leads 
to 
unjust 
judgements 
and 

defamation. Though DeVos used 
many anecdotes in her speech 
to depict the prevalence of false 
accusations of sexual assault, 
statistics show the percentage of 
reports that are classified as false 
are only about 2.1 to 7.1 percent. 
She also doesn’t acknowledge 
the fact few people report their 
assaults to the police, meaning 
many assaulters never receive 
punishment for their crime in the 
justice system.

The University has taken 

significant 
strides 
to 
help 

survivors. Following DeVos’s 
initial threat to roll back Title 
IX guidelines, University of 
Michigan 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel sent an email to 
the 
community 
citing 
the 

University would stick to its 
current sexual assault policies. 
In 2016, the University revised 
its sexual misconduct policy 
from 2013. It more clearly 
defines “consent,” stresses that 
past or current relationships 
do not constitute consent each 
time, and, for the first time, 
outlines step by step what was 
involved in reporting an assault 
to the University.

Still, Devos’s policy change will 

have dangerous ramifications. 
Despite 
our 
university’s 

commitment to standing with 
survivors 
of 
sexual 
assault, 

without federal pressure, it is 
likely not all college campuses 
will follow suit.

Many detractors of Title IX 

guidelines argue institutions of 
learning should not meddle in 
students’ legal affairs. Rather, 

they believe these cases should 
be reported directly to legal 
authorities. Doing so, however, 
removes the agency survivors 
have in choosing how to proceed 
with their case. By taking away 
the survivor’s choice about a 
highly personal and traumatic 
event in their lives, it will likely 
make the situation much more 
difficult. Furthermore, college 
administrators have a unique 
responsibility to deal with sexual 
assault 
given 
the 
proximity 

survivors are put in with their 
assaulters on a college campus.

Additionally, those who oppose 

the Title IX protections fear that 
those who are wrongfully accused 
of sexual assault on university 
campuses will have their lives 
ruined, despite clear evidence 
that few would end up convicted, 
or even tried. Universities do not 
levy criminal punishment for 
perpetrators; the worst thing 
that can happen to a student at 
the university level is expulsion, 
which, in the grand scheme of 
things, is a lot better than serving 
time for a felony offense.

In order to eliminate the 

prevalence 
of 
sexual 
assault 

on 
college 
campuses, 
the 

conversation 
must 
center 

around survivors. The federal 
government must work toward 
solidifying 
tangible 
solutions 

for students who survive sexual 
assault solutions so they, too, 
can work toward the future they 
dreamed of. But given that the 
current federal government is not 
going to hold them to the previous 
standards, the University, and 
universities across the country, 
must continue to set its own 
high standards to combat sexual 
misconduct on its campuses.

To call Godspeed You! Black 

Emperor’s music challenging 
is to scrape the surface of their 
20+ 
year 
post-

rock innovation. 
But 
it’s 
true, 

nonetheless. 
The 
collective’s 

approach 
radically 
differs 

from 
the 
two-

three 
minute 

structure 
that 

defines the 21st century pop 
hit. 
Interfacing 
orchestral 

instruments, 
arrangement 

and 
song 
structure 
with 

textures 
and 
progressions 

traditionally found in rock, GY! 
BE yearns for the age-old while 
simultaneously 
beckoning 

forth the distant future.

Here, 
Luciferian 
Towers 

is no different. The album 
is immense, at points nearly 
exploding. Yet, cooling off 
at 44 minutes, the album’s 
magnitude is found not in its 
length, but rather between the 
huge swaths of noisy ambience 
and fractured chaos it lugs you 
through.

“Undoing 
a 
Luciferian 

Towers” is a clamoring call 
to arms. The drum pattern 
evokes images of Civil War 
drummer boys leading marches 
down the battlefield. Waves 
of feedback pierce the empty 
space 
between 
whispering 

guitars. 
Woodwinds 
shriek; 

trumpets whimper; in jazz-
like fashion, the instruments 
compete for attention. For a 
burgeoning seven-off minutes, 
we approach Judgment Day.

One of Luciferian Towers 

distinctive 
footprints 
is 

its 
obsession 
with 
and 

manipulation of noise. While 
GY! BE has long been interested 
in inharmonious sound, what 
is striking about their most 

recent is its distorted, fuzzy 
timbre. At its most gentle, 
the instruments bear a slight 
whirr, while at its most intense, 
everything seems like it’s been 
run through a Bit Crusher. 
The sound of the pick running 
down an electric guitar string 
is manipulated into a dial-up 
crinkle in “Bosses Hang, Pt. 

II.” On “Anthem 
for No State, Pt. 
III,” 
clangorous 

feedback 
saturates 
the 

soundstage, only 
the guttural kick 
drums 
finding 

space to escape.

Now, Godspeed 

You! Black Emperor’s music 
has long drawn influence and 
been critical of the political 
sphere. Consider the album’s 
track 
titles: 
“Undoing 
a 

Luciferian Towers,” “Bosses 
Hang,” 
“Fam/Famine” 
and 

“Anthem for No State.” Even on 
its Bandcamp page, each track 
comes with a series of cryptic 
remarks aimed to contextualize 
the sound. On “Bosses Hang,” 
they write “Labor, alienated 
from the wealth it creates / So 
that holy cow, most of us live 
precariously! / Kicking at it, 
but barely hanging on!”and — 
“The proud illuminations of 
our shortened lives!”, also — 
“More of us than them!”, also — 
“What we need now is shovels / 
Wells, and barricades!”

While 
Luciferian 
Towers 

oscillates 
between 
densely 

packed 
pandemonium 
and 

gentle, minimal soundscapes, 
the album’s flaw lies in its 
dynamics. For one, the album 
seems 
engineered 
entirely 

around the strings. To be 
fair, this is the majority of 
the collective. Yet, even in 
those few occasions where 
electronics, brass or drums 
emerge 
in 
the 
foreground, 

the 
mastering 
seem 
more 

concerned in letting the strings 
breathe rather than focusing 
on their melodic complements. 
Where “Anthem for No State, 

Pt. III” has a brilliant drum 
section that could’ve exploded 
into a movement resembling 
“Providence”, guitar melodies 
overtake 
the 
composition. 

On “Fam/Famine,” the kicks 
and 
snares 
flail 
in 
every 

direction, but they sit so far 
in the distance behind walls 
of reverb-induced guitar and 
violin that their complexity is 
difficult to notice.

While 
this 
album 
is 

instrumental 
like 
the 
rest 

of their catalogue, there is 
a marked absence of field 
recordings and vocal samples 
that littered their earliest LP’s. 
So, even though the music is 
gripping and rife with conflict, 
the only contextualization of 
the sounds are the track titles. 
It’s clear that GY! BE wants to 
make contact with the political, 
but they seem to offer nothing 
more than emotional reprieve, 
which, of course, might be the 
point.

Luciferian Towers is one 

massive event — one single, 
cathartic 
release 
— 
rather 

than a series of less significant 
moments strung together in 
succession. Although distinct 
points do beg to be re-listened, 
these moments feel incomplete 
without the context of what 
comes before and after it.

Like the rest of Godspeed’s 

catalog, 
running 
through 

the 
entirety 
of 
Luciferian 

Towers comes with a sense of 
accomplishment. 
When 
the 

album’s main theme makes its 
final reprise on “Anthem for No 
State, Pt. III,” we feel resolved. 
Few artists today can make 
music as rich and cathartic, 
let alone without lyrics or 
field recordings. And this is 
ultimately what makes their 
music so challenging, because 
we can step away from the 
music and feel as if we gained 
something. But it’s nothing 
physical; it’s nothing we can 
point to and claim de facto.

Maybe it’s defying norms. 

Maybe it’s just learning to 
focus.

Godspeed You! Black 
Emperor stays mighty

Following up on 2014’s “The 

Secret Service,” the second 
“Kingsman” film spends most 
of its runtime trying and failing 
to justify its existence. Like the 
first film, “The Golden Circle” 
is filled to the brim with rip-
roaring action sequences, nifty 
spy gadgets and pretty people 
taking off their clothing. What 

this second film lacks that 
the first film so greatly had is 
originality.

Like the first film, “The 

Golden 
Circle” 
features 
a 

fantastic 
ensemble 
led 
by 

Taron Egerton (“Eddie the 
Eagle”) as Eggsy Unwin, now 
a 
world-saving 
superspy. 

Colin Firth (“Bridget Jones’s 
Baby”) 
and 
Mark 
Strong 

(“Miss Sloane”) also return to 
reprise their roles 
from the original 
film, 
joined 
by 

Halle 
Berry 

(“Kidnap”), Pedro 
Pascal 
(“Game 

of 
Thrones”), 

Channing Tatum 
(“Logan 
Lucky”) 

and 
Julianne 

Moore (“Maggie’s 
Plan”) as an evil 
drug 
trafficker 

out to destroy the 
world. As should be obvious 
from these names, the cast 
is superb, and watching this 
many 
talented 
people 
hop 

around the globe saying silly 
things is certainly fun. But 
we’ve seen this all before, and 

with a plot that feels strangely 
similar to that of “The Secret 
Service,” it’s hard not to wish 
that director Matthew Vaughn 
(“Kick-Ass”) had offered up 
something different with his 
sequel.

The 
thing 
that 
most 

differentiates this film from 

other sequels is 
the addition of 
the 
Statesman, 

a 
group 
of 

American 
spies 

that hides their 
organization 
behind a liquor 
business 
rather 

then 
a 
tailor 

shop. 
While 

the idea behind 
the 
Statesman 

is 
interesting, 

nothing much is really done 
with them. Other than a few 
cheap gags, the Statesman don’t 
add anything to the dynamic 
that the Kingsman already had.

The action sequences, which 

were a definite highlight of the 

“The Secret Service,” are still 
the main draw here. Vaughn 

employs a diverse use of slow 
motion, close ups and hyper-
stylized movement to create 

truly unique action sequences. 
The problem is that there 
are just so many of them. It 
rarely stops. By the time the 
characters are making a final 
stand set to “Country Roads,” 
the audience has long ago 
lost interest. “Kingsman: The 
Golden Circle” is at least a 
half-hour too long and could 
probably have done with two or 
three fewer action scenes.

Since 
the 
film’s 
release 

last week Vaughn has said 
in numerous interviews that 
he intends to complete his 
trilogy with another Kingsman 

film before moving on to 
spin-offs (possibly involving 
the Statesman or others). If 
he wants this series to be 
remembered 
he’s 
going 
to 

have to work harder to make 
the third movie feel different 
from 
the 
first 
two. 
Right 

now 
it’s 
hard 
to 
imagine 

this formula working a third 
time. “Kingsman: The Golden 
Circle” skates by on goodwill 
for the characters and the 
franchise held over from the 
first movie. “Kingsman: The 
Third Chapter” might not be so 
lucky. 

Star-studded ‘Kingsman’ 
sequel succeeds by chance

“It feels like only in my 

nightmares will I see my own 
body, dead and still. But when 
sleep paralysis cross-pollinates 
what is dreaming and what is 
real, the fears of seeing my own 
body, frozen and corpse like, is 
unfortunately so realistic.”

I wrote this immediately 

after waking up from my worst 
episode 
of 
sleep 
paralysis. 

But before I enter the truths 
of this hellacious experience, 
it’s important to see what’s 
happening, how to fight it and 
of course, how to prevent it.

Sleep 
paralysis 
can 
be 

defined 
as 
“a 
temporary 

inability to move or speak 
while falling asleep or upon 
waking.” 
As 
someone 
who 

suffered from chronic sleep 
paralysis, and after hours and 
hours of research, I finally have 
a decent explanation for what’s 
happening in our bodies. And 
it’s hauntingly fascinating.

Our brains go into REM 

cycle while we sleep, which is 
what produces vivid, internal 
dreams. When we are in REM, 
our bodily senses turn off and 
let us have uninterrupted sleep. 

By shutting off our senses, our 
body allows mental REM to 
safely take over, so you don’t 
actually attempt to jump off 
the building and fly (something 
you might be dreaming of in 
that moment).

Imagine your senses like 

light 
switches: 
When 
you 

sleep, they’re all turned off. 
Normally when we awake, 
all those switches turn on 
at once. We see the sunlight 
through our window, we hear 
the chipmunks chatter and we 
taste our oh-so-nasty morning 
breath. But in the instance of 
sleep paralysis, those senses 
turn on at different times, 
and eventually, they are all on 
except for one: your ability to 
feel.

You’re lying in bed, unable 

to move and usually unable to 
speak, but there is the window 
with the light and sound of 

the cars rushing by outside. 
It’s all there, but muscles and 
senses that are under voluntary 
control, like getting up out of 
bed, are not available. You’ve 
woken up before your REM is 
over; you’re paralyzed, and it’s 
freaking terrifying. 

Your mind has completed 

its REM; it’s ready for the day. 
Meanwhile, your body is still in 
it, longing for more sleep and 
relaxation. I imagine my nerves 
and my receptors firing at one 

another: Half of me needs to 
go to my 9 A.M. class, and the 
other half of me needs to keep 
sleeping. It paralyses me.

So one may question: how 

did I get to this moment and 
how the hell do I get out of 
it? Whether it’s one random 
episode, or four times in one 
semester (like myself), the 
reasons for sleep paralysis are 
all common and most likely 
preventable. Those who do 
experience this are usually 
under great stress, suffer from 
regular anxiety, have had an 
irregular sleep schedule, or 
they’ve simply been sleeping 
on their back all night. Other 
factors can include depression, 
drugs and alcohol and certain 
medications.

I’ve 
suffered 
from 
sleep 

paralysis quite a few times 
in my life, starting in my 
adolescence and in high school. 
But with the social, academic 
and emotional stress of college, 
and 
as 
someone 
who 
has 

anxiety, sleep paralysis has 
found a new place in my life.

My excerpt above reflects 

one of the terrors I had when 
trying to come out of my sleep 
paralysis. 
My 
nightmare 

showed my body in the exact 
position it was in my bed, and 
it was all from a birds-eye 
view. I wasn’t breathing in this 
image, my body was lifeless and 
I wasn’t asleep –– I have seen 
what I will look like when I die. 
The scariest thing about all of 
this is the utter lack of control 
that you have. Every day, we 

live in control of our minds, 
our bodies and our souls; every 
choice, every motion, that’s 
all up to us. And the instant 
we lose that ability to be an 
autonomous human is a fear 
that many, if not all of us, would 
not want to encounter.

To 
be 
quite 
honest, 
I 

thought that nightmare was 
the worst part of it all, but 
boy was I wrong. The moment 
I woke up from the paralysis 
and hallucinated a daunting 
black figure in my bathroom 
was something I had never 
experienced before. It was 
there when I decided that this 
cannot happen again, or at least 
not like this.

With a pretty consistent 

sleep schedule, no caffeine 
before bed, some melatonin, a 
happy episode of New Girl or a 
chapter of a good book, I have 
now been free of sleep paralysis 
since April. Making sure our 
bodies and our minds are 

relaxed before sleep is so vital, 
not just for sleep paralysis, but 
for our overall health. Take 
preventative 
action 
sooner 

than later, and that can even 
start by telling others. Tell 
your roommates, your family 
and your significant other. The 
more people aware of this, the 
more they can help you and the 
more they can be informed for 
themselves. 

If 
you 
do 
happen 
to 

experience sleep paralysis, do 
not fight it. What makes the 
dreams and the aftermath so 
horrifying is that our body and 
our mind are at war. To safely 
wake up, allow your body to 
sleep, let your mind dream the 
crazy dreams. And you will get 
out of it. I can promise you that.

‘Menashe’ is an authentic 
portrayal of fatherhood

Menashe is not perfect; in 

fact, he is anything but. He 
works a mediocre cashier job at 
the local grocery, 
fails to pay his 
bills and thinks 
a 
balanced 

breakfast 
consists 
of 

cake and soda. 
Menashe, played 
by real-life Hasidic Jew (and 
amateur actor) Menashe Lustig, 
just can’t seem to get it right. 
Recently widowed, Menashe 
vows to fight for the one thing 
in his life that he cares about: 
his son. His brother-in-law 
does not respect him, his boss 

thinks 
he 
is 
incompetent, 

even the Ruv (the community 
Rabbi) himself thinks Menashe 
can’t make it on his own. 
Menashe is given the choice 
to conform to the traditional 
two-parent home or fight a 
losing battle as a single father 
— an unfathomable idea in the 
Hasidic enclave of Brooklyn.

“Menashe” is a Yiddish film 

loosely based on the chubby, 
bearded 
lead 
actor’s 
own 

story in confronting a society 
that has expected him to fail. 
Within the Hasidic community, 
secular culture — including the 
English language — is seen as 
un-kosher. Such communities 
have cut themselves off from 
the rest of the world, so while 

the film is set in 
Brooklyn, it feels 
like 
a 
distant 

country 
where 

they 
dress 
in 

black and white 
and 
say 
things 

like 
“verklempt.” 

Although the community feels 
distant, the themes and story 
can feel personal for anyone, 
regardless of background. The 
film is just as much about the 
isolated Hasidic culture as it 
is about a father figuring it 
out and a son who loves him 
regardless of whether he wears 
a “streimel” or not.

Written and directed by 

documentary cinematographer 
Joshua Z. Weinstein (“I Beat 
Mike 
Tyson”), 
“Menashe” 

sometimes 
evokes 
the 

realism and authenticity of 
a documentary. This is only 
fueled by the fact that the film’s 
cast is made up of amateur 
actors 
from 
the 
Hasidic 

community. While the film is 
not a documentary, it certainly 
could be. The characters are 
inspired by real people and 
the story closely follows that 
of the experiences of Lustig 
himself. Trying to capture 
the Hasidic world from the 
inside is practically impossible 
due to the reclusive, insular 
nature 
of 
the 
community. 

Weinstein even had to use a 
Yiddish translator on the set 
in order to communicate with 
the cast. Weinstein manages 
to accomplish being both an 
informed insider, thanks to 
the authentic cast, and an 
objective 
outsider, 
looking 

in at the community like an 
anthropologist 
conducting 

ethnographic research.

“Menashe” is an emotional 

journey filled with an equal 
amount of laughs, cries and 
frustrated sighs. While we 

want to root for Menashe, it is 
challenging. Throughout the 
film he is called a “schlimazel” 
—one who is plagued by bad 
luck and shadowed by disaster 
after disaster — and he does 
not 
disappoint. 
No 
matter 

what Menashe does, it ends 
in misfortune. Yet, in the 
end, his son still sees him as 
a superhero, as his father. 
His son’s unconditional love 
makes the viewer want to love 
Menashe all the more.

NBC

When “The Good Place” 

premiered last fall, viewers 
were invited into the weird 
world 
that 
is 

creator Michael 
Schur’s (“Parks 
and Recreation”) 
unconventional 
take 
on 
the 

afterlife. 
The 

first 
season 

follows Eleanor 
Shellstrop, 
brilliantly 
played 
by 
Kristen 
Bell, 

(“Frozen”) as she maneuvers 
the ups and downs of a “good 
place” in which she did not 
rightfully 
belong. 
Why? 

Eleanor was a bad person 
in real life, and she knew it. 
Nothing she did on Earth 
warranted a place in this 
fro-yo heavy, hangover-less, 
soulmate inclusive utopia.

It was too good to be true. 
In the final moments of 

season 
one, 
viewers 
were 

left with a jarring twist: The 
Good Place is, in fact, The Bad 
Place. It is not a town of good 
people enjoying eternity, but 
rather, it is a town comprised 
of 
mid-level 
Bad 
Place 

employees who have taken the 
human form to torture four 
unknowing deceased humans. 
Those humans are Eleanor, 
her pedantic soulmate Chidi 
(William 
Jackson 
Harper, 

“Paterson”), 
materialistic 

frenemy 
Tahani 
(Jameela 

Jamil, “The Official Chart”) 
and the simple-minded D.J. 
Jason (Manny Jacinto, “The 
Romeo Selection”).

This 
twist 
completely 

rocked the boat. It flipped the 
entire premise of “The Good 
Place” on its head. Schur and 
his team spent the first season 
building an entire world just 
to break it down. And, finally, 

the time has come to see what 
“The Good Place” really is. 

The first episode of season 

two began by immediately 
pivoting the show from its 
expected protagonist-centric 
plot to a multi-faceted story 
for an ensemble cast. The 

revelation 
that 

“The Good Place” 
was 
not 
just 

created to be the 
torture pool for 
Eleanor, 
but 
in 

fact also Chidi, 
Tahani and Jason, 
opens 
up 
the 

possibilities 
for 

storytelling. This 

device has been used before, 
notably in “Orange is the New 
Black,” where the show moved 
from the singular story of 
Piper Chapman to the diverse 
stories of her fellow inmates. 
“The 
Good 
Place” 
hooked 

viewers with the unique story 
of Eleanor Shellstrop, but it 
will keep viewers with the 
colorful array of characters 
present in her world. 

To 
quote 
Taylor 
Swift 

(which, 
by 
Schur’s 
point-

system 
analysis, 
might 
be 

egregious enough to have me 
sent to the Bad Place), “The 
Good Place” is a nightmare 
dressed as a daydream. Now 
that the daydream is naked 
and the nightmare is revealed, 
the fun begins. The formerly 
hapless 
and 
uninteresting 

neighbors in The Good Place 
are 
now 
characters 
with 

wants, needs and quirks. A 
particular standout is Josh 
Siegel’s Glenn, a Bad Place 
worker intent on biting the 
humans. 
As 
Michael 
(Ted 

Danson, “Cheers”) revels in 
his role as the Architect of this 
hellscape, 
his 
subordinates 

struggle to come to terms with 
their unconventional role.

The bad version of “The 

Good 
Place” 
feels 
like 
a 

behind-the-scenes 
glimpse 

into 
the 
making 
of 
this 

world. With the veil lifted 
on 
Michael’s 
true 
nature, 

viewers follow his journey as 
he plots and engineers the best 
way to torture these souls. 
It’s interesting to see the 
amount of work which goes 
into creating the torture for 
our heroes. Michael reminds 
his subordinates of the fun 
they had creating chaos after 
Eleanor’s drunk shenanigans 
at Tahani’s welcome party (in 
season one). He encourages 
them to get her drunk again 
tonight, so they can have the 
same fun in the morning.

Only 
this 
time, 
Eleanor 

is wiser. She isn’t as easily 
swayed by her human vices. 
Although her memory has been 
re-set, the character of Eleanor 
grew too much over the course 
of season one to lose all that 
progress. It would have been 
foolish of the show’s writers to 
set the characters back exactly 
where they started. Similar 
to Michael’s decision to find 
new ways to torture these 
established characters, Schur 
and his writers have chosen 
to find new ways to advance a 
repetitive plot.

What made the first season 

of “The Good Place” so exciting 
and fun to watch was the fresh 
and 
clever 
storytelling. 
It 

didn’t feel like anything else 
on television, and kept the 
light-hearted tone of Schur’s 
previous successes “Parks and 
Recreation” 
and 
“Brooklyn 

Nine-Nine.” As season two 
moves forward, it will be 
interesting to see how the tone 
and storytelling is maintained. 
What it’s shaping up to be 
is an ensemble comedy with 
dynamically flawed characters 
who are lovable in their own 
right.

The Good Place may be The 

Bad Place now, but the TV 
show is still heavenly.

‘M’ grinds to draw against Golden Gophers

Sarah Stratigakis beat a defender, 

dribbled around the goalkeeper and 
slid a desperate left-footed attempt 
towards the empty net. 

All she could do was wait and 

watch as the ball trickled towards 
the goal for what seemed like an 
eternity. 

“If that hits the wrong piece of 

grass, it’s going to hit the post,” said 
Michigan women’s soccer coach 
Greg Ryan.

Fortunately for the Wolverines, 

it didn’t. 

The freshman midfielder’s shot 

found the back of the net with 
just 10 seconds left in regulation, 
salvaging a 2-2 draw for Michigan 
(1-1-1 Big Ten, 4-2-4 overall) at 
Minnesota.

Despite being jam-packed with 

tension, Thursday night’s contest 
was in many ways lopsided, and if 
all opportunities were equal, the 
Golden Gophers (0-1-1, 4-2-3) could 
rightfully say they dominated the 
match.

Against 
a 
shorthanded 

Wolverine 
squad 
missing 
five 

regular starters, Minnesota went 
on the attack early and often. The 
Golden Gophers fired off nine shots 
in the first 20 minutes, and outshot 
Michigan for the entire match by a 
whopping 39-7.

“We had hoped that we would be 

able to take care of the ball a little 
better and possess the ball a little 
more, but it just didn’t go that way,” 
Ryan said. “We definitely worked 
to keep it as tight as we can in the 
back and look for our chances on 
the break.”

In particular, the absences of 

defenders Brooke Cilley and Sura 
Yekka forced the Wolverines to 
adjust. Redshirt junior Taylor 
Timko, the usual starter at left 
back, had to move to centerback 
instead, which cost Michigan a key 
attacking threat.

“It’s her first game at centerback 

so it was a lot of learning for her 
on the fly,” Ryan said. “It’s a tough 
position to be moved into. We 

missed Taylor because she’s so 
good getting forward wide.”

For all its ammunition, however, 

Minnesota 
failed 
to 
seriously 

challenge Sarah Jackson early on. 
The Wolverines’ senior keeper had 
to make just three routine saves in 
the first half.

Meanwhile, the Wolverines’ two 

attempts were the two best chances 
of the first half. Just six minutes in, 
junior midfielder Reilly Martin sent 
a corner into the danger area. The 
ball bounced to redshirt sophomore 
midfielder Katie Foug, but her 
point-blank effort was swallowed 
up by Minnesota goalkeeper Kailee 
Sharp.

Twenty minutes later, though, 

Foug 
got 
a 
second 
chance. 

Stratigakis corralled a long ball on 
the break and sent a chip-shot over 
a Golden Gopher defender into the 
box. Rushing in from the left, Foug 
volleyed the ball off a bounce and 

coolly slotted it into the bottom-
right corner for her first goal of the 
season.

“It’s all about being clinical,” 

Stratigakis said. “Even though they 
did have more shots than us, it’s 
about how important it is to score 
that goal.”

In the second half, Minnesota 

continued its high-pressure attack 
but was much more precise. Four 
minutes in, Jackson sprawled to 
her right to deflect forward April 
Bockin’s wide-open effort in the 
box — one of five saves she recorded 
in the first 20 minutes of the half 
alone.

Despite the best efforts of 

Jackson and the Wolverines’ back 
line, maintaining a shutout while 
conceding over 20 shots isn’t 
exactly sustainable.

For Michigan, it was sustainable 

for 75 minutes, before Minnesota’s 
Julianna Gernes equalized on a 

rebound from close range.

The Golden Gophers continued 

to attack, looking to put away the 
scrappy Wolverines once and for 
all. And they very nearly did — with 
just over four minutes remaining, 
Gernes scored her second goal off 
a nifty back-heel assist from Sydney 
Squires.

With under a minute to play, 

Minnesota had one final possession 
to ice away the victory. But the 
Golden Gophers were unable to 
run the clock down completely, 
resulting in one last gasp for the 
Wolverines. Foug launched a ball 
downfield, Stratigakis caught up to 
it, and Michigan had new life.

“Just a great effort from Sarah,” 

Ryan said. “For a freshman to make 
that kind of effort to get your team 
back in the game is amazing.”

In overtime, Minnesota didn’t 

appear to show any signs of a 
letdown after conceding with just 

seconds left. The Gophers mostly 
dominated the two 10-minute 
periods, continuing to be aggressive 
in and around the box. Their best 
chance to win came six minutes 
into the first overtime when the ball 
dropped in front of a wide-open 
Athena Kuehn, but sophomore 
defender 
Jada 
Dayne’s 
clutch 

clearance extinguished the threat.

Looking for a game-winner and 

a hat-trick at the same time, Gernes 
took Minnesota’s final shot with 20 
seconds left, but it flew high over 
the crossbar, and Michigan escaped 
with a result.

“We gave game balls out to 

everybody,” 
Ryan 
said. 
“This 

was going to be a tough game 
and we knew it. We had a lot of 
inexperienced players and players 
playing out of position. We just told 
them how proud we were of their 
effort and just sticking together and 
fighting until the last second.”

ZOEY HOLMSTROM/Daily

Freshman midfielder Sarah Stratigakis scored with just 10 seconds left in regulation, locking the game at two and giving the Wolverines a tie aggainst Minnesota.

Coming into this weekend, the 

Michigan volleyball team knew 
it would be in for a tough test 
— one that would require truly 
tremendous play to pass. 

After losing in four sets at No. 

1 Minnesota (1-1 Big Ten, 12-1 
overall) on Friday, the Wolverines 
(0-2, 10-4) hoped to rebound in a 
nationally televised game against 
No. 5 Wisconsin in Madison.

With the second set hanging 

in the balance, Michigan looked 
poised to tie the match at one 
set each. The Wolverines took a 
pivotal 28-27 lead after a forceful 
block from redshirt sophomore 
Cori Crocker was slammed down 
to the floor for a point.

But then, sophomore setter 

MacKenzi Welsh fired a serve 
out of bounds and the Badgers 
(1-1, 10-1) took the next two points 
to seal the second set, before 
flattening the Wolverines in the 
final set, 25-13.

Suddenly, 
the 
20th-ranked 

Wolverines had an 0-2 Big Ten 
record.

Both 
losses 
came 
despite 

the Wolverines holding several 
considerable 
leads 
before 

eventually crumbling.

“I think we got a little 

undisciplined this weekend, and 
we didn’t really stay with the 
plan as much as we could’ve,” 
said Michigan coach Mark Rosen. 
“We weren’t able to stay with our 
normal, consistent execution.”

Inconsistency 
plagued 

Michigan through both matches, 
as it struggled to piece together 
a 
full 
set 
of 
well-rounded 

volleyball. The offense shined at 
times, but for long stretches, it 
sputtered. The Wolverines had 
an astonishing 48 attack errors 
while also posting six service 
errors. They appeared to be 
controlled by the blockers of both 
Minnesota and Wisconsin, who 
almost always seemed to know 
where Michigan was going to hit 
the ball. Both teams combined to 
stuff the Wolverines 30 times.

In short bursts, the defense 

appeared to be the mainstay. 
Junior libero Jenna Lerg finished 
the weekend with 26 digs and 
Skojdt had a solid defensive 
performance against Wisconsin, 
contributing 10 digs.

But even those performances 

were fleeting. On Friday, it 
conceded 
nine 
consecutive 

Minnesota points to open the 
fourth set. On Sunday, it allowed 
seven straight Wisconsin points 
to fall behind in the third set.

“We had periods of time where 

we executed very well,” Rosen 
said. “But you got to be able to do it 
over the length of the match, and 
we didn’t do that well.”

Though the first test went 

poorly, Rosen believes Michigan 
is prepared to face the next one. 
“We’re gonna be (ready),” he said. 
No question about it.”

Big 5 Challenge shows potential to repeat magic season

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

tennis team wrapped up its 
spring season with something 
the program never had before — 
a national singles champion in 
sophomore Brienne Minor. 

This weekend, the Wolverines 

dealt with the challenge of 
launching a new campaign after 
their 
unprecedented 
season. 

And though there is room 
for 
improvement, 
Michigan 

demonstrated its potential to 
duplicate the spring’s magic.

Freshman Bella Lorenzini’s 

collegiate debut epitomized this 
potential. Lorenzini stepped 
up in her first invitational, 
commanding three of her four 
singles matches and sweeping 
her three doubles sets.

“Bella 
did 
great,” 
said 

Michigan 
coach 
Ronni 

Bernstein. “She’s come in and 
really done a good job as far as 
her work ethic goes. She fits 
in well, works really hard and 

brings intensity every day. It 
was good to get her out there 
and used to the college format.”

Lorenzini 
got 
her 

introduction to the collegiate 
tennis climate at the Big 5 
Challenge, the commencement 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 
fall, 

individual-scoring 
season. 

Texas 
Christian 
University 

hosted Michigan, along with 
Texas Tech, Georgia, South 
Carolina, 
Virginia 
Tech, 

Virginia and Arizona State in 
the three-day invitational over 
the weekend.

Bernstein 
selected 
the 

invitational to kick off the 
Wolverines’ fall action because 
of the quality of the competing 
teams — the Red Raiders, 
Bulldogs and Gamecocks all 
finished 
their 
2017 
spring 

seasons ranked in the top 15 in 
the nation.

In addition to Lorenzini, 

junior Kate Fahey had a stellar 
outing of her own. It was a 
return for her, as a lower back 
injury hindered her ability to 

play throughout the summer, 
and Fahey picked up three 
of her four singles matches. 
She topped off her weekend 
successes with a dynamic 6-3, 
7-5 victory over her Georgia 
opponent.

“(Fahey) did a good job and is 

in great shape,” Bernstein said. 
“She just hasn’t had matches 
under her belt recently.”

Michigan didn’t have all 

of its ammo at the opening 
invitational, 
as 
Minor 
was 

unable to compete due to knee 
procedures. Though she will 
likely be out for the entire fall 
season, she will be back to 
compete when team scoring 
commences in January.

The Wolverines began play 

Friday, squaring off against 
South Carolina and Virginia. 
Michigan picked up five of its 11 
singles matches, and two of its 
five doubles matches.

The 
Wolverines 
upgraded 

their doubles game Saturday, 
sweeping both matches against 
TCU opponents. Senior Alex 
Najarian and sophomore Chiara 
Lommer combined for a 6-4 
victory, and Fahey and Lorenzini 
paired up for a 6-3 win.

Sunday was more of the same 

for Michigan, as the Wolverines 
went 2-0 on the doubles court 
again. 
Fahey 
and 
Najarian 

served their Vermont opponents 
a 6-1 defeat, while Lommer and 
Lorenzini combined for a 6-0 
rout.

Michigan’s 
singles 
play 

struggled on both of these 

days, as the Wolverines picked 
up a total of three wins. Fahey 
contributed 
heavily 
to 
this 

output, providing two of the 
three victories.

Bernstein emphasized that 

this weekend was a jumping 
off point and that there is 
room for growth even before 
Michigan’s Wildcat Invitational 
in Evanston next weekend.

“(The competition) gave us 

a good idea of where we are at 
the beginning of the season, 
and where we want to get to,” 
Bernstein said. “The whole 
weekend, the quality was really 
good and we were pushed. It 
shows us what we need to work 
on both individually and as a 
team.”

Harbaugh calling for 
league-wide changes

Jim Harbaugh didn’t mince 

words.

Michigan’s head coach was 

unhappy 
with 
the 
facilities 

provided to his team during 
Saturday’s game at Purdue. He 
wasn’t pleased with the visitor’s 
locker room, comparing it to 
a “hot box,” and he certainly 
wasn’t pleased with the medical 
equipment 
on 
hand. 
While 

speaking at his weekly press 
conference Monday afternoon, 
Harbaugh made it very clear that 
he believes there needs to be 
league-wide reform to prevent 
the type of situation his team 
encountered.

“We are going to look at 

everything 
we 
can 
do 
for 

the visiting team here at the 
University of Michigan as it 
relates to a standard of care 
for visitors,” Harbaugh said. 
“It’s 
become 
apparent 
after 

going around to all the visiting 
schools the last couple years that 
(there’s) a conscious effort of 
gamesmanship.

“It’s unsportsmanlike when 

you have locker rooms that are 
too small, (and) they’re not 
heated or cooled properly. In 
this case, (there was) no air 
conditioning.”

Part 
of 
Harbaugh’s 

frustration stemmed from the 
measures the Wolverines had 
to take to deal with the heat 
Saturday afternoon. According 
to Bruce Feldman of Fox Sports, 
Michigan staffers told him that 
“it was like 110-plus (degrees)” 
inside the locker room, while 
the temperature outside climbed 
to 89 degrees by kickoff. On 
Monday, Harbaugh confirmed 
that he had allowed players to 
wait onboard the team’s air-
conditioned bus before the game 
for a brief reprieve from the 
elements.

It 
appears, 
though, 
that 

the biggest sticking point was 
Purdue’s insufficient medical 
equipment. 

“I wish I’d have taken a 

picture of the actual table that 
was given to the visitors to put 
the players on when they’re 
injured,” Harbaugh said. “It 
looks like it was from the ‘20s. 
It was ripped. Just not good. I 
think that’s a pattern in the Big 
Ten.”

Harbaugh was particularly 

displeased with the fact that 
redshirt 
junior 
quarterback 

Wilton Speight — who suffered 
an injury in the first quarter — 
had to leave the stadium when he 
needed further medical testing.

“There needs to be a way to 

X-ray a player at the stadium,” 
Harbaugh said. “There needs 
to be a minimum standard of 
care for players. We put a lot of 
emphasis on health and safety 
of the players, but it didn’t even 
seem sanitary.

“... Injured players can’t get 

an X-ray. (Speight was) taken to 
a student health center in a van. 
We needed a brace for a player, 
and there wasn’t one at the 
facility we were taken to. A lot of 
things needed to be addressed. 
I would ask the rest of the Big 
Ten coaches to look into this as 
well. Make this a priority. We’re 
talking about all our players 
here.”

Harbaugh is no stranger to 

gamesmanship. It’s well-known 
that he searches for any way to 
gain a competitive advantage 
over opponents. But this is one 
area that he believes should be 
left alone — and he’s willing to 
take charge in leading efforts for 
reform.

“We’ll start first with us 

and make sure that when you 
have guests, when you have 
visitors coming in, their health 
and safety needs need to be 
addressed,” 
Harbaugh 
said. 

“... It needs to be addressed by 
the commissioner and I would 
hope it would be looked into 
immediately.

“... 
Gamesmanship 
should 

cease at the line of health and 
safety for the players.”

Michigan’s coach cites experience at Purdue in his plea for 
the Big Ten to establish standards for visiting locker rooms.

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh was vocal in saying that the Big Ten needs to establish standards for locker rooms. 

I would ask 
the rest of 
the Big Ten 
coaches to 

look into this 
as well. Make 
this a priority.

Notebook: Harbaugh talks MSU night game

In less than two weeks, No. 

8 Michigan and Michigan State 
will play under the lights for 
the first time in series history. 

Both athletic departments 

announced Monday that the 
annual meeting between the 
two in-state rivals will kickoff 
at 7:30 p.m. this year. It will be 
the first night game at Michigan 
Stadium since 2014 — an 18-13 
win over Penn State — and just 
the fourth in program history.

The University announced 

in a statement that the game 
is already sold out and warned 
fans 
it 
has 
already 
seen 

counterfeit 
tickets 
on 
the 

market.

Meanwhile, Michigan coach 

Jim 
Harbaugh 
reiterated 
a 

point that he has made clear 
in the past: he’s not a fan of 
night games — or later starts in 
general.

“I prefer if they’re kicked off 

at 12, 1 on a Saturday afternoon,” 
Harbaugh said. “It most appeals 
to my football sensibility.”

The 
contest 
against 
the 

Spartans may not be the only 
night 
game 
that 
Harbaugh 

will have to deal with this 
year, though. It’s likely the 
Wolverines will also have to 
play at night against No. 4 Penn 
State, which has already picked 
its Oct. 21 home contest against 
the Wolverines as its famed 
‘Whiteout’ game. A Nov. 18 road 
game at Wisconsin, meanwhile, 
could be a late start as well.

Winovich earns award, 

praise

With his new hair, Chase 

Winovich may remind some of 
Green Bay’s Clay Matthews, 
another fearsome pass-rusher 
with long, flowing blonde locks.

Yet on Monday afternoon, 

his coach made a different — 
and even more impressive — 
comparison.

“Chase is playing like JJ 

Watt,” 
Harbaugh 
said. 
“I 

thought he had his best game 
ever as a football player.

“... Constant hustle from him. 

He had a great game. It looked 
like he was in great shape. It 
looked easy for him, and it 
wasn’t. 
Those 

were 
tough 

elements.”

Harbaugh 

wasn’t the only 
one 
to 
take 

notice of the 
redshirt junior 
defensive end’s 
performance 
against Purdue.

Winovich, 

who tallied six 
tackles (four for loss) and three 
sacks in the 28-10 win, was 
named Big Ten co-Defensive 
Player 
of 
the 
Week 
along 

with Iowa linebacker Josey 
Jewell. Winovich also earned 
the 
Walter 
Camp 
National 

Defensive Player of the Week 
award on Sunday.

Through four games, he leads 

the conference and ranks third 
nationally in sacks.

Harbaugh calls hit on 
Speight “egregious”

When 
asked 

Saturday 
night 

for his thoughts 
on 
the 
hit 

that 
injured 

redshirt 
junior 

quarterback 
Wilton 
Speight, 

Harbaugh didn’t 
have much of a 
reaction.

He 
did, 

however, have a 

lot more to say two days later.

“Having 
seen 
it 
now, 
I 

thought 
it 
was 
egregious,” 

Harbaugh said. “If I had a 
stronger word to use, I would 
use it. With all the emphasis on 
protecting defenseless players, 
it appeared that the player knew 
what he was doing. He targeted 

the head and neck area when a 
player was on the ground and 
then accelerated into it.

“I was surprised you had two 

officials standing back there, 
both looking at it, plus a review 
in the press box and that wasn’t 
targeting and wasn’t a personal 
foul.”

After the hit, Speight was 

attended to by trainers for 
several minutes before leaving 
the game. He eventually left 
the stadium to receive X-rays 
at Purdue’s student health 
center.

Harbaugh was unwilling to 

delve into the specifics of his 
starting quarterback’s injury, 
so Speight’s status remains 
mostly unknown. One thing is 
clear though — he’ll need more 
than a week to recover.

“If we were playing a game 

this week he wouldn’t be able 
to play,” Harbaugh said. “And 
we’ll assess it as we go.

“... He’s a very tough guy. Very 

hopeful he’ll be back soon.”

Redshirt junior defensive end Chase WInovich drew praise from Jim Harbaugh on Monday for his play against Purdue.

Seniors shine for ‘M’

Behind strong performances 

from its seniors, the Michigan 
men’s golf team finished in 
fifth place at the Northern 
Intercollegiate at Sugar Grove, 
Ill. 
this 
past 

weekend. 

The 
first 

day 
of 
the 

outing — which 
contained 
two 
rounds 

— 
started 

rough for the 
Wolverines, 
as they shot a 
lackluster 
295 

(+7). But thanks 
in part to a 67 (-5) from senior 
Ian Kim, Michigan rallied for 
a final score of 284 (-4) in the 
second round. 

“The first day we started 

slow, but Ian really picked it up 
for us and had a fantastic second 
round,” said Michigan coach 
Chris Whitten.

The Wolverines carried their 

momentum into the second 
day, shooting a 285 in the third 
round to help 
them come back 
to even overall 
on 
the 
score 

card.

“We 
came 

out 
stronger 

today, 
and 

really got some 
good 
help 

from 
senior 

Kyle Mueller,” 
Whitten said.

Mueller isn’t 

new to Michigan, and his steady 
play isn’t either. Mueller was 
tied for eighth overall, and shot 
eight birdies over the weekend. 
When asked about Mueller’s 

play, Whitten said he wasn’t 
surprised by it.

“Kyle is capable of that,” 

Whitten 
said. 
“It 
wasn’t 

surprising, he actually could’ve 
done even better.”

Even with the solid showing 

at 
the 
outing, 
Whitten 

believes 
there 

is still room for 
improvement. 
The 
fifth-place 

finish isn’t what 
Whitten or the 
Wolverines 
want, citing that 
they believe that 
they

every outing.

“Our goal is to 

keep learning as a whole, and to 
keep eliminating the mistakes,” 
Whitten said.

Some of the Wolverines’ 

potential could be reached with 
the help of some new faces. 
Michigan is bringing on three 
freshmen this year, and it has 
just two seniors on the entire 
roster. Whitten believes this to 
be a sign that his team will grow 
with each outing.

The 

Wolverines 
do 
have 
a 

couple 
more 

opportunities 
this 
fall 
to 

improve, 
with 

invitationals 
at 

both 
Alabama 

and 
Texas 
in 

the 
month 
of 

October.

If 
Michigan 

can continue to 

get contributions from its upper 
classmen while the freshmen 
develop, then Whitten’s goals 
for his team may be within 
reach.
