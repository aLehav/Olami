Spaces on the first and sec-

according to Yurk. Additionally,
student rooms have received
mechanical and electrical
upgrades, such as new lighting
and flooring features, updated
fire suppression systems and air
conditioning.

Yurk said that during the
renovation process, the team
was able to create more student

some of which contain two

adding that they will be avail-

UNIVERISTY ADMINISTRATION
Regents slated
to discuss Wall
Street structure

* Similar plan was
highly unpopular
in 2008
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily StaffReporter
At its last meeting of the
school year, the University's
Board of Regents will take
another look at the possible
construction of a parking
garage on Wall Street, near the
Kellogg Eye Center, north of
the University Hospital.
The Regents approved con-
struction of the Wall Street
East Parking Structure in Sep-
tember 2008, only to cancel the
plans in July 2009 due to the
proposed Fuller Road Intermo-
dal Station project with the city
of Ann Arbor.
Now that the University has
scrapped plans for the Fuller
station due to funding com-
plications, Timothy Slottow,
the University's executive vice
president and chief financial
officer, is asking the board
to reconsider the Wall Street
plans.

Slottow requested in a com-
munication to the regents that
they approve the hiring of an
architect to restart the project
Slottow noted that the open-
ing of the C. S. Mott Children's
and Von Voigtlander Women's
Hospital has greatly increased
the pressure for parking in the
area. According to the com-
munication, 300 "prime" park-
ing places for employees were
repurposed for use by patients
and visitors.
"More employees are park-
ing remotely and traveling by
bus to work," Slottow wrote.
"On a typical day, we estimate
that 2,500 employees are park-
ing in remote lots and taking
a bus or shuttle to the medical
center. Additionally, there are
about 1,500 employees utilizing
alternative means of transpor-
tation, including riding the bus
from home, ridesharing, or van
pooling."
The resurrected project will
cost approximately $34 million
and will add 500 parking spaces
to the area. Slottow added that
environmental sustainability is
a focus for the project and the

Parikh, Hashwi
confirmed by UEC in
3-2 vote
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
Following a marathon hearing
that lasted through the night and
delayed the results of the Central
Student Government election by 10
hours, it appeared that the candi-
dates' weeks spent campaigning and
politicking were finally over.
Still, the events of that night,
nearly a month ago, did not truly
come to a close until Friday.
In a 3-2 decision, the University
Elections Commission prevented
the disqualification of the election's
winners, Business junior Manish
Parikh and his running mate, LSA
junior Omar Hashwi. The UEC's
vote was identical to how it ruled
on election night, when members of
youMICH and OurMichigan filed
the suit based on allegations that
Parikh abused an e-mail listserv.
After Business junior Shreya
Singh lost the election by only about
150 votes, youMICH appealed the
UEC's original hearing, which then

Last month, the Michigan

omore Brianna Porter sent a

chain e-mail to members of the
University's Greek community
alleging that acab driver sexu-
ally assaulted the out-of-town
guest of a Delta Delta Delta
sorority member.
On April 6, Porter sent an
additional e-mail retracting
the chain message with allega-
tions against van driver Samu-
el Pickard, known by many as
Big Wade. In the most recent
e-mail obtained by the Daily,
Porter wrote that police have

advised her that Pickard is no
longer suspected of sexually
assaulting the alleged victim,
known as Emily in Porter's
original e-mail.
"If Emily was sexually
assaulted by acab driver a few
weeks ago, the crime was com-
mitted by someone other than
Big Wade," Porter wrote. "I

WHAT'S UP, DOC?

Students fight for women's sports

39 years ago this week (April
19th, 1973): Education junior
Sheryl Szady and LSA junior
Linda Laird asked the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents to create
a varsity athletic program for
women during the public com-
mentary section of the regents'
meeting, accordingcto a statement
from Szady.
At the time, female athletes
could only conmpete in intercol-
legiate athletics through cluhs
sponsored hy the Recreational
Sports Department, according to
Szady.
The University implemented
a female varsity sports program
into its Athletic Department in
February 1974 under the direc-
tion of President Robben Fleming.

In an interview yesterday,
Szady said she's proud of the
progress made in female athletics.
"It's definitely moving in the
right direction, and the women
athletes now are having won-
derful experiences," Szady said.
"They get to travel to play, and the
type of competition is so much
different and so muchhbetter than
what we had. I know t speak for
hoth Linda and I, we're so happy
that the program has moved in
the right direction and is doing
well."
59 years ago this week (April
17, 1953): University officials
expressed disappointment over
a hill filed hy the State Senate
Finance Committee which cut
off 85 percent of the University's

hudget request, The Michigan
Daily reported.
While the University request-
ed $9.9 million, the Senate hill
only provided $1.3 million.
University Vice President
Marvin L. Niehuss said the Uni-
versity's funding request was
"entirely legitimate."
He added that all the projects
requested were of importance,
hut two especially important
items included plans for a Medi-
cal Science Building and an auto-
motive lahoratory on North
Campus.
The state authorized $90,000
for a new lihrary on the site of
the automotive lahoratory at the
time.

The potential shortage of a
key component used to make
fuel lines and brake lines could
force automakers in the U.S. and
around the world to close car and
truck plants as they run short of
parts.
Auto industry executives have
scheduled an unprecedented
meeting today in suburban
Detroit to talk about the prob-
lem. Officials from as many as
10 automakers and dozens of
parts supply companies are set
to attend.
A March 31 explosion at Evon-
ik Industries in western Germany
killed two workers and damaged
a factory that makes CDT. That
chemical is a key component in a
nylon resin called PA12, which is
used to make a specialized plas-
tic. The plastic is used in auto fuel
lines and brake lines. It is also a
component in solar cells, pipe-
lines, sporting goods and house-
hold items.

Aides soft-pedal
remarks Romney
made to donors
Mitt Romney's aides soft-ped-
aled his latest tax pronounce-
ments yesterday, insisting he
wasn't tipping his hand when
he told donors privately that he
might seek to end the tax break
for mortgages on second homes
and curb other deductions for the
wealthy as part of tax reform.
"He was just discussing ideas
that came up on the campaign
trail," said former Sen. Jim Talent
of Missouri, a frequent campaign
surrogate. The remarks, made at a
closed-door fundraiser in Florida
and overheard by reporters, did
not mark any "change in policy,"
Talent said on a conference call
with reporters.

Firing was over

A former computer special-
ist with NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory was laid off because
he was combative and didn't keep
his skills sharp - not because he
advocated for his belief in intel-
ligent design while at work, an
attorney said yesterday in a case
that plays on the tensions over
the controversial origins-of-life
concept.
David Coppedge, who worked
on NASA's Cassini mission
exploring Saturn and its many
moons, sued JPL for wrongful
termination in a case that has
generated intense interest among
i proponents of intelligent design
- the idea that life is too complex
to have evolved through evolu-
tion alone.

North Korean
rocket launch
The U.N. Security Coun-

cil strongly condemned North
Korea's rocket launch yesterday,
announcing it will impose new
sanctions and warning of further
action if Pyongyang conducts
another launch or a new nuclear
test.
Acting swiftly, the 15-member
council, including North Korea's
closest ally China, adopted a
presidential statement under-
scoring its united opposition to
Friday's launch - which violated
U.N. sanctions - and the mili-
tary policy being pursued by the
country's young new leader, Kim
Jong Un.
The council directed its sanc-
tions committee to expand the list
of North Koreans entities subject
to asset freezes and identify more
proliferation-sensitive technology

"The death of a student

Where the real danger is

By now, cuts to public educa-
tion aren't a shocker. In fact,
they're
expected.
Whetherit'spub-
lic universities or
K-12 schools, by
this point almost
everything has
been on the bud-
getary chopping
block - multiple HARSHA
times, especially NAHATA
in Michigan, as
of late.
You can only say one thing over
and over again until it gets tiring.
Every time there are cuts to educa-
tion, it's the same cycle of opposi-
tion. Arguments are made about
valuing teachers, building a solid
foundation for future generations
and becoming globally competitive
in the job market. But it's all in vain,
because in spite of all the rhetoric,
cuts to education are still passed
year after year after year.
It's a simple'fact: Cutting edu-
cational funding isn't good. Some-
where deep down, I'm sure everyone
- politicians included - knows
this. It's one of those no-hrainers.
Regardless of how you feel about
government involvement in public
education, it's easy to logically see
how taking money away from edu-
cating the next generation might
not be the best idea. Yet, education
is always the first to go. Not because
it's the least useful, but because it's
the easiest target, the simplest way
to enact short-term relief without
having to face immediate political
consequences. But it'll add up. It
already has.
As I mentioned, the arguments
against education cuts are over-
worn. They've been repeated to
the point where saying them again
seems pointless. Still, I'm going to
make the argument one more time.

we walked off to

Or, at least that's one way to justify
another spring break without expos-
ing yourself on camera.
You're really not supposed to
spend your journey feeling sick and
sorry inyour hostel. This is rule num-
ber one. Rule number two: Go outside
and do things that other white people
haven't done.
In retrospect, hiking may not have
been the best choice.
At any rate, the oriental rugs, the
threadbare couches, the faint scent of
patchouli and old meat -just enough
to remind you of Mom - really did
seem right. Tucked between the
scraggly intergalactic land turds
("historical rock formations") and
the abandoned cave monasteries,
the little den we carved out felt like
the answer. And yes, maybe draw-
ing our conclusions from a drug hut
was a bit tasteless, even ignorant. But
then the sun begins to set, and you
all - namely, us and ten Turkish men
- pass that bottle of wine and laugh
for reasons that don't transcend lan-
guage barriers, and you kind of feel
like this has to be the meaning you
came here to find.
According to the guidebook,
things began quite normally. At the
end of our block stood a small stone

house where we take off our clothes
and get sweaty for lots of money.
Right. Post-sauna, we were escorted
to the massage room, an aesthetically
pleasing fall-out shelter lined with
midget sinks. This was where Turk-
ish Susan Boyle waddled over to me,
and, without warning, heaves a bed-
pan full of water over my head. I sit,
soaked and stupefied. Meanwhile,
my companion, with the gentle mas-
seuse, was calmly laid on the stone
floor and slowly drizzled with water.
But my dearest Susan had her
own plans. Before I can clear the
water from my eyes, she's pelting
me with a pillowcase full of liquid
dish soap. And then she starts tak-
ing my top off. And flips me over on
the stone. And without even asking
for my name or if I prefer big spoon
or little spoon, she flops her hands
right over my lady lumps and mash-
es them into oblivion.
"Excuse me, was that, um, includ-
ed in the price?"
Shortly after the sloppy nipple
tweak, however, this first hypothesis
was scraped. The score - God and
tubby masseuse:1. Science and white
chicks: 0.
And our second hypothesis was
born: Perhaps the chubby scuttle-
turned-mating ritual shows what
happens when the Eastern egg meets
the Western sperm. You go in not
knowing a lick of Turkish, not under-
standing a morsel of their everyday
life and you think you'll be fine. And
then your boobs are turned into soup
and an extra 50 lira flies down the
midget drain.
We still can't figure it out, to be
honest. But really, how could we
have known? My parents always
skipped the hammams on our road
trips through the awe-inspiring
Buckeye countryside. "The Turkish
bathhouses can wait, Melanie - my

God, are you saying you don't want

Actually Mom, that's exactly what
I'm saying. But, sometimes all the
protesting in the world doesn't get
you out of smothered hash browns
and the subsequent diarrhea. Or, the
least seductive water-boarding in all
of human history.
But somewhere between 45
hours worth of bus rides, misplaced
blonde-haired fame - "Lady Gaga!"
- sleeping in tree houses and caves,
deciphering directions in a language
that quite honestly looks like the
alphabet regurgitated - between all
the hustle and bustle, eureka! We had
it! We had nothing! After two weeks
of meeting, seeing, loving, hating and
smelling oh, so terrible, we arrived
back in Spain with nothing but dusty
bags and existential woes. "How was
your spring break?" "IDK, I'm wait-
ing for my analyst to decide."
But you know, maybe that's all W
right. Or, at least, so goes hypothesis
three, the laziest one yet - shut up
about the human condition already.

last Wednes- Stadium
day.
After that
game, Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins was very adamant
about her disappointment with
her team. But after her team
posted 19 shutout innings against
Michigan State, Hutchins was
quick to praise the performance.
"Holding (Michigan State) to
zero was the name of the week-
end," Hutchins said. "It gives me
more confidence."
The two players responsible
for restoring Hutchins' confi-
dence were freshmen pitchers
Haylie Wagner and Sara Dries-
enga.
Due to Wagner's weekend per-
formance, which was highlight-
ed by a complete-game shutout
on Sunday, she was given the Big
Ten Pitcher of the Week award
for the fourth time this season.
"All my mechanics are work-
ing," Wagner said. "I'm just back
in my zone."
Wagner pitched 13.2 shutout
innings, earned two wins and
picked up her second save. She
also struck out eight Spartan
batters in the series and surren-
deredno walks over the week-
end.
In addition, Driesenga was
named Big Ten Freshman of the
Week for the second time as a
result of her all-around perfor-
mance at both the plate and in
the circle.
In the series, Driesenga batted
.600 with a home run and two
RBIs against the Spartans, and
she threw 5.1 scoreless innings
while striking out two.
Driesenga also played small
ball for the Wolverines, laying
two sacrifice bunts in the series
finale.
Hutchins, who does not like to
classify her players by the year
they are in school, had a lot to say

By BEN SEIDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
When junior Alec Stirton was
cut from Michigan's club lacrosse
team his freshman year, he was
devastated. But he didn't sit and
sulk. Stirton knew plenty of other
lacrosse players in the same posi-
tion, so he decided to start ateam
of his own.
Stirton's dream began when
four players showed up for a try-
out on a middle-school field with-
out lines or nets. Practices were
held in the gymnasium of Ann
Arbor's Angell Middle School.
In that first year, it was mostly
a ragtag bunch of misfits who
played pick-up lacrosse without
scheduled practices or a set place
to play.
Even though expectations
were bleak, Stirton - the captain,
founder and coach - knew there
was nowhere to gobut up.
"I reached out to the head
coach of the (former) Michigan
club team, John Paul, and met
with him to gain some insight as
to how to run a team and recruit
players," Stirton said. "He was
extremely helpful in giving me
a contact list of players that had
tried out for the team and were
cut, just like me."
In its first season, the club

team carried just a handful of
substitutes and remained com-
pletely self coached. Regardless,
it finished the 2011 season with
an improbable record of 8-5 in
the Great Lakes Lacrosse League,
playing against teams from Wis-
consin, Michigan State, Ohio
State, Holy Cross and Northwest-
ern.
The team emerged victorious
over the Spartans twice and took
fifth place ina league comprising
more than 30teams, playingtheir
home games on different local
high-school fields, depending on
availability.
This year, the program has
grown considerably in size, with
the roster filled with more than
50 players.
And this past Saturday night,
the team played under the lights
at Elbel Field in front of a crowd
of enthusiastic fans that packed
the bleachers. Even though
Michigan lost to Hope College,
the team saw the game as a vic-
tory in itself and a huge leap for-
ward.
"(That) night was the biggest
game our team has ever played,"
Stirton said. "Hope College is
an extremely talented squad, as
they compete in the Men's Colle-
giate Lacrosse Association."
In its first true home game,

Michigan brought the score to
within one goal with only a min-
ute left to play. In exciting fash-
ion, the Wolverines made it a far
closer game than anyone could
have predicted.
On Sunday, Michigan lost to
a tough Holy Cross squad - the
top team in the division - by a
score of 7-3. However, the Wol-
verines followed up their poor
performance with a clean rout of
Loyola, 10-0.
Now sitting at second in their
division, their final division
games will be decided next week-
end.
"The first home game was
awesome. Having people to play
for and having them encourage
the team throughout was great,"
said junior midfielder Jonathan
Sherman. "This game is very
useful going forward."
The league championship
will take place in Madison,
Wisc. The team's goal for the
season is to win that champion-
ship.
One onlooker, LSA junior
Holden Warriner, found the
team's progress remarkable.
"It is really awesome to see
people doing what they love to
do most and taking it as far as
they can," Warriner said. "That
is the true meaning of effort."

Freshman Sara Driesenga won her second Big Ten Freshman of the Week award.

Merklein gives student-athletes a winner's edge

By ALEX STEINHOFF
Daily Sports Writer
The year was 1994. Mark Merk-
lein had just clinched the first
set of the match against USC's
Wayne Black, 6-2. But Black, who
would eventually go on to win
four doubles Grand Slams, wasn't
going to let Merklein cruise to a
national championship.
Black and Merklein battled to
a second-set tiebreaker before
Black pulled it out, 10-8, to send
the championship match to a
third set. Merklein, Florida's all-
time leader in singles victories,
wasn't going to be denied. In
the third set, Merklein finished
strong to beat the Zimbabwean,
6-4, winning the national title as
a member of the Florida Gators.
Merklein accomplished a life-
long dream, and he was already
gearing up for his next goal of
becoming a successful profes-
sional tennis player.
College tennis players dream
of earning All-American status,
winning national championships
and some day playing on the pro-
fessional circuit. For many, this
dream is just that - a dream. But
for some members of the Michi-
gan men's tennis team, such as
junior Evan King, this dream
isn't so far-fetched. The fantasy
becomes more realistic when
somebody who lived it before
helps make it possible.
This past season, Michi-
gan shocked the college tennis
world when it hired Merklein as
assistant coach. Merklein, who
played his college tennis under
current Michigan head coach
Bruce Berque at Florida, gives
the Wolverines more than just an
experienced coach.
"I don't think our guys needed
(Merklein) to know they wanted
to play professional tennis and
win a national title," Berque said.
"But when you have somebody
who's done that and who's had
success coaching players who've

done that, I think that's really
meaningful."
The story starts eight months
before Evan King, the Wolver-
ines' oldest player, was even born.
Merklein and Berque were both
new to the Florida program in
1990. Merklein had just commit-
ted to play tennis for the Gators,
while Berque had just accepted
the assistant coaching position -
his first coaching gig in men's col-
lege tennis.
Berque and Merklein led the
Gators to their first SEC cham-
pionship in 25 years in 1994, but
Merklein's individual accom-
plishments were more astonish-
ing.
Merklein didn't waste any time
in his first two years, earning
All-American status as a fresh-
man and a sophomore. He fol-
lowed those accolades the next
two seasons by winning the dou-
bles National Championship as a
junior and the 1994 NCAA singles
title to close out his college career.
Almost immediately after
becoming the first Gator ever to
win a National Championship,
Merklein turned pro. Berque
jumped to the pro circuit one year
later to become Merklein's per-
sonal coach.
During his 11 year professional
career, Merklein learned the ups
and downs of professional tennis.
In singles, his ranking hovered
inside the top 200, reaching its
highest point of No. 160 in 1997.
But doubles was a different story.
Merklein was resilient.
Merklein won four doubles
titles. And in 2004 - one of Merk-
lein's last seasons as a profession-
al tennis player - he reached No.
37 in the world with doubles part-
ner James Blake.
Merklein retired from pro-
fessional tennis in 2005, but he
wasn't quite finished with the
game. Just a few months later, he
took a coaching position at the

day, up close and personal.
"The biggest thing he's helped
me with is, I think, the every-
day approach that, if you want
to become a successful college
player and go on to being a suc-
cessful professional, you have
to treat every practice intently,"
King said. "There's always some-
one working really hard out there,
so you just have to stay on track."
King is all-in when it comes
to the advice Merklein has for
him. For King, Merklein's suc-
cess as a player speaks for itself.
As a coach, Merklein has inspired
King to work towards winning a
national title. But, rest assured,
Merklein only wants King to
achieve the goals he has set for
himself.
King also spoke highly of
Merklein's tremendous resources
in the tennis community. Merk-
lein even hadhis formerpupil and
doubles partner Blake give Kinga
call. King had a hard time hold-
ing back his excitement and was
"giddy like no other" when he was
on the phone with the former No.
4 player in the world.
As Blake's coach, Merklein was
responsible for the intense fit-
ness program that helped get him
back into shape after his 2004
injuries. With King, Merklein is
implementing a similar training
program, hoping to elevate King's
game to the highest level.
"We've just got to start work-
ing harder, and we've done that
and worked on his fitness, getting
him stronger," Merklein said. "He
has come a long way, but for him
to go after what he really wants,
day in and day out, he has to be
the same player that he is when
he is at his best.
"That's tough for anyone to do.
But he's learning and working
harder to be more consistent now,
and I think he's going to do well."
When Michigan hired Merk-
lein last summer, it sent shock-
waves through the tennis world.

The thought of a USTA coach
moving from Florida to Ann
Arbor to become a college assis-
tant coach was beyond belief.
More than 15 years removed
from Florida, Merklein is happy
to be back in college tennis again.
But he was careful to stress that
he was happy to be back in college
tennis as a coach. While he cites
elbow pain and age as to why his
playing days are over, even King
isn't so sure.
"I've been playing with him in
practice, and he's stillgotit," King
said. "He can take some sets off
of people in practice, including
myself. It's cool to have that kind
of person around every day."
Whether it's bonding with the
team, drilling them in practice, or
playing practice matches against
the Wolverines' top singles play-
ers, Merklein is more than just
Michigan's assistant.
Merklein is a tremendous
resource in the tennis commu-
nity, a fantastic hitting partner
and a tangible example of what
college tennis players dream of
becoming.
But most importantly, Merk-
lein has been able to get the best
out of the Wolverines. Not by yell-
ing and screaming, but by helping
his players understand what it
is they want to achieve and how
they can get there.
"I think I have a good feel for
the guys, and what they want and
need, and I try to make this fun,"
Merklein said. "This is why they
started playing the game - they
love the sport. I am trying to get
every ounce I can out of each guy
and, at the same time, I don't want
guys walking out of the facility
not knowing what I am doing.
"We're going to work hard,
and some of it's going to be tough,
but I want them to have fun and
love this. This is as good as it gets
right now. The tour is a lonely
thing, but playing here with your
friends is fun, and hopefully I let
them enjoy it."

ALBUM REVIEW
Hopping aboard
the fee -ood Train
With 'California 37' ,

MUSIC COLUMN
Goodbye, but 'Call Me'

the pop-rock group
stays on track
By GREGORY HICKS
Daily Arts Writer
Train is a failure - a failure at
disappointing. Though the band
hasn't changed its style very
much, the years
have been kind
to the group's
likability. Save Train
Me, San Fran-
cisco put Train California 37
back on the
radar after its Columbia
three-year pro-
duction hiatus and California 37
proves that the previous album's
success wasn't just a stroke of
luck,but aresultofthe band's skill
to generate consistently catchy
material.
Perhaps this comes from the
merger of two undying quali-
ties: humor and love. Lyrics from
tracks such as "You Can Finally
Meet My Mom" have an air of
self-aware stupidity that can be
described as nothing less than
cute - forming an image that's
induced fainting from Pat Mona-
han fans since 1998. "(He'll) just
lie down and close (his) eyes and
think about stuff," sung with a
slight pause, as though he's put-
ting deep thought into the choice
of the word "stuff." One can't help
but giggle.
This album also wins the
award for most name-drops on a
single record - or even a single
song. The opening track on the
album, "This'll Be My Year," con-
sists entirely of a timeline filled

COLUMBIA

Looking for ourselves out here.
by brand-name inventions and.
movie, music, and locational allu-
sions. "In '85 ... Nintendo comes,
Live Aid too,'Back to the Future,'
where were you?" Many songs
tell a story, but Train is willing to
go so far as to include actual dates
to narrate the given events.
Lyrically speaking, the record's
lead single "Drive By" is one of
the weaker tracks on the album,
but not nearly weak enough to be
criticized. This Billboard Top-
20 hit also has a sister track, "50
Ways To Say Goodbye," which is a
sort of "Drive By" meets the Latin
fiesta of J. Lo's "Ain't It Funny."
"Drive By" was a brilliant
choice of a promotional single
for not being too stylishly silly
- and because "everything
is groovy" is in the melody -
but the group's second single
release, "Feels Good At First,"
might not be so brilliant. It has
that same medium-paced, gui-
tar-accompanied rhythm used
by the Plain White T's in all of
their popular songs. One might
call this the "Rhythm of Love."

Not that one group has any sty-
listic influence over the other,
but listeners have probably had
their fill of this type of song.
Breaking its former musical
pattern, Train collaborates with
country singer Ashley Monroe
on the album. A featured col-
laboration is a first for Train,
let alone one of a country style.
Though "Bruises" is the group's
first country number, Train is of
the pop-rock genre, so it isn't like
country is a complete 180 on its
sound. But a country duet does
combine a fascinating handful of
firsts into one track.
The album won't produce any
hits on the level of "Hey, Soul
Sister" or "Drops of Jupiter,"
but if this is a cause for disap-
pointment, drown it out with the
record's goofy, charming content.
It's sure to cure these bitter feel-
ings - though in an ironic sort
of way. Train shines with confi-
dence in California 37, blooming
heaps of lyrical originality and'
feel-good melody. The album is
more fun than fun. itself.

Every year, thousands
of dollars, pounds, yen,
rubles and wishes are
thrown into fountains. Some of
those wishes are dead serious,
some frivo-
lously flipped,
chucked or
tossed. And
inevitablythe
change piles
up, the coins
get dried out,
the dreams JOE
linger on. DIMUZIO
Carly Rae
Jepsen's "Call
Me Maybe" has torpedoed its
way to ubiquity over the last
couple months. It has sped under
the surface from its September
release last year toward a vol-
canic eruption of popularity
through Justin Bieber's Twit-
ter, radio play from Billboard
to Belgium and omnipresent,
speaker-decimating broadcasts
from every other open porch and
house party in Ann Arbor.
"I threw a wish in the well" it
begins - all typified, pop roman-
tic - barely cooed over a quiet
kick drum and synthesized vio-
lins, easily subsumed by crowds,
packed houses and pumped kegs.
As it skips toward that chorus, it
links arms with everybody who
hasn't caught on with it yet...
cheers, whoops, hollers, smiles,
groans. You hear that? "Call Me,
Maybe" is on. The refrain hits,
little else matters.
I've heard it blasted while
rolling around in the trunk of a
friend's pick-up truck, and leak-
ing out of more than a couple
earbuds on buses Iwill stop rid-.
ing soon. It became the de rigeur
topic of more than a few pre-
class, Michigan-time whispered
conversations. My Italian pro-
fessor was forced to hear it. I've
seen it inspire drunken whirling-
dervish hysteria, exasperated

moans and absolute confusion all
within a few square feet.
I've marked the last four years
of my time here with pop songs.
I've recalled memories that I'd
forgotten with the help of a few
treacly bars and refrains. I came
to Ann Arbor with some wishes,
songs and friendships. And I've
seen a lot of change.
If the phone ever rang on the
landline phone in my old East
Quad dorm in Prescott, I was
prone to stare in fear rather than
pick it up. Filling out my taxes,
I wasn't sure which home was
home, which phone number to
put down. The transience of
college - like a fantastic and
particularly expensive pop
song - confused, inspired and
changed me. Expressing that
growth, shift and desire over
the last four years has been the
toughest challenge of all.
Pop music is a
metaphor for
collegiate souls.
We have plenty of options for
communication now, each with
their individual sensitivities,
style and depth. We can reserve
quidk, angular hieroglyphics
for texts. Sprawling prose for
e-mails, massaging keyboards in
search of meaning. Breaking out
the archaic hand-written letter,
ever so rarely, to express perhaps
our most grave and heartfelt
feelings - with our hands press-
ing the pen, cramping the mus-
cles in our hand, driving ink into
paper, letting our mind change
in the course of a sentence hur-
tling toward a period that either
succeeds or fails to adequately
end it.

But Carly wants to be called.
She wants the intimacy of hear-
ing the voice, the extemporane-
ous speed and feeling - just
shy of commitment - of actual,
physical presence ... Is there
anything more typical of my
generation?
Carly's asking, sure, but she's
really demanding. That "maybe"
in the refrain is no expression
of doubt, but rather an acknowl-
edgement of possibility. It sug-
gests that sometimes promises
are not kept; that wishes have
that nasty opportunity of never
coming true. And that some-
times, the unexpected or mirac-
ulous can happen - whether
you recognize it now or after
four years, thousands of dollars,
friendships and late nights.
Carly's not throwing her coin
into the well without a little bit
of faith. "Before you came into
my life / I missed you so bad,"
she says, as the MIDI orchestra
swirls over and over, the kick
drum pulses harder and a shrill
guitar does acrobatic loops in the
background. Like a good roman-
tic, she knew he existed before
she met him. We sing along with
her, we watch old dreams die,
we blow out candles, we make
new ones. We change our phone
numbers, we lose our phones, we
try and choose the best words o
express ourselves and sing futile
jingles in the divide between
meaning and feeling.
You hit repeat. The town looks
a little different. Younger kids
take your place, throwing their
coins into the fountain. There's
always construction. You begin
to forget people, music, whole
years. Some pop songs come
along and help you remember.
You hit repeat.

Romne pursues
Possibilities

Soon-to-be
Republican
nominee proceeding
with caution
BOSTON (AP) - Don't look
for a vice presidential shocker
from Mitt Romney. His choice
of a running-mate - a search
he announced yesterday he has
begun - will be guided by both
his methodical, risk-averse corpo-
rate training and the lessons his
party learned from Sarah Palin's
selection.
Preparedness to serve and
loyalty to Romney are likely to
trump other credentials as the
all-but-sure. Republican nomi-
nee looks to avoid the blowback
John McCain faced four years
ago with his surprise choice of
the little-known, first-term Alas-
ka governor for the GOP ticket.
Questions about Palin's readi-
ness to serve, McCain's decision-
making and his advisers' vetting
came to define the Arizona sena-
tor's flawed campaign.
Mindful of that, Romney will
put experience at the top of his
list of .qualities as he chooses a
No. 2, according to senior advisers
and GOP operatives familiar with
his thinking. They spoke on the
condition of anonymity because
they were not authorized to speak
candidly about a process Romney
himselfis tryingto keep as private
as possible as he works to narrow
a field that may begin with as
many as a dozen prospective can-
didates.
"The hallmark for Governor
Romney's candidacy, and how
he would be as president, is that
he approaches these decisions in
a well-thought-out methodical
way," said Steve Duprey, a former
McCain adviser and current New
Hampshire-based member of the
Republican National Committee.
"It won't be like the McCain cam-
paign where there was a big sur-
prise and effort to create a game
changer.".
For all the secrecy surround-
ing the process, the former Mas-
sachusetts governor did give a
few hints about his plans yes-
terday, disclosing that he had
chosen his former chief of staff
and 2008 presidential campaign
manager, Beth Myers, to lead
the vetting and analysis of pro-

spective running mates. Several
other members of the tight-knit
cadre that has surrounded Rom-
ney for years also are likely to be
involved.
Romney was largely tight-
lipped beyond the staffing
announcement. He said the
selection would certainly happen
before the Republican National
Convention in late August. But
he wouldn't provide any more
guidance on any internal dead-
line his team has set. And when
asked about potential choices -
and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio,
specifically - Romney hedged,
as he has consistently in recent
months.
"Well I think he's one of the
terrific leaders in our party, but I
think it's way too early to begin
narrowing down who the poten-
tial vice presidential nominees
might be," Romney said in an
interview with Diane Sawyer:of
ABC News outside Fenway Park in
Boston. "Butwe're beginningthat
process, we'll talk about a lot of
folks, and then go through he kind
of vetting and review process that
you have to go through to make
sure whoever you select will pass
the evaluation that's required by
the American people.".
In addition to his running mate
being prepared to assume the
presidency, Romney has laid out
only one other public criterion:
that he or she oppose abortion
rights. The condition could help
reassure social conservatives that
Romney is serious about his oppo-
sition to abortion - a sore point
because he supported abortion
rights when he ran for the Senate
in 1994.
Several Republicans familiar
with Romney's thinking down-
play the importance of choosing
a running mate from a particular
battleground state or an impor-
tant voting demographic.
Romney also is expected to
avoid a candidate with the kind
of star power that might distract
too much attention from the
party's main campaign themes
- Republicans are working to
make the election a referendum
on President Barack Obama - or
overshadow the GOP presidential
nominee himself.
Rubio, 40, is one such celebrity
candidate. And the junior Florida
senator also has little experience,
in the midst of only his second
year on Capitol Hill.

HElKO JUNGE
Norwegian Anders Behring Breivik, who is facing terrorism and premeditated murder charges, reacts as a video presented by the prosecution is shown in court,
Oslo, Norway, yesterday. Breivik confessed to killing 77 people in a bomb-and-shooting massacre and went on trial in Norway's capital yesterday.
Norway's -mass killer cries at
hearing tears no'utofpity'

Unrepentant killer
denies authority of
judge in case
OSLO, Norway (AP) -Anders
Behring Breivik shed tears as he
went on trial yesterday for kill-
ing 77 people - but not for his
victims. The emotional display
came when prosecutors showed
his anti-Muslim video.
Dressed in a dark suit and
sporting a thin beard, the right-
wing fanatic defended the July
22 massacre as an act of "self-
defense" in his professed civil
war, and sat stone-faced as pros-
ecutors described how he killed
each of his victims.
But he was gripped by emo-
tion when they showed a video
warning of a Muslim takeover
of Europe and laden with cru-
sader imagery that he posted
on YouTube before the attacks.
Suddenly, the self-styled "resis-
tance" fighter's eyes welled up.
He cringed his face and wiped
away tears with trembling
hands.
"Nobody believes that he
cried out of pity for the victims,"
said Mette Yvonne Larsen, a

lawyer representing survivors
and victim's families in the
court proceedings.
Breivik showed no signs of
remorse on the first day of a trial
that is expected to last 10 weeks.
After being uncuffed, he extend-
ed his right arm in a clenched-
fist salute. He refused to stand
when the judges entered the
room.
"I don't recognize Norwe-
gian courts because you get your
mandate from the Norwegian
political parties who support
multiculturalism," Breivik said
the first time he addressed the
court.
The 33-year-old Norwegian
also announced he doesn't rec-
ognize the authority of Judge
Wenche Elisabeth Arntzen
because he said she is friends
with the sister of former Nor-
wegian Prime Minister and
Labor Party leader Gro Harlem
Brundtland.
Eight people were killed in
Breivik's bombing of Oslo's gov-
ernment district and 69 were
slain in his shooting massacre
at the left-leaning Labor Party's
youth camp on Utoya island out-
side the capital.
Breivik has said the attacks

were necessary to protect Nor-
way from being taken over by
Muslims and that he deliber-
ately targeted the governing
Labor Party, which he claims
has betrayed Norway with lib-
eral immigration policies.
"I admit to the acts, but not
criminal guilt," he told the
court, insisting he had acted in
self-defense.
While Norway has a legal
principle of preventive self-
defense, that doesn't apply to
Breivik's case, said Jarl Borgvin
Doerre, a legal expert who
has written a book on the con-
cept. "It is obvious that it has
nothing to do with preventive
self-defense," Doerre told The
Associated Press.
The key issue to be resolved
during the trial is Breivik's
mental state, which will decide
whether he is sent to prison or
into psychiatric care. Anxious
to prove he is not insane, Breivik
will call right-wing extremists
and radical Islamists to testify
during the trial, to show that
others also share his view of
clashing civilizations.
One mental examination
found him legally insane, while
another said he wasn't sick

enough to be committed to psy-
chiatric care instead of prison.
If deemed mentally competent,
Breivik would face a maximum
prison sentence of 21 years or
an alternate custody arrange-
ment under which the sentence
is prolonged for as long as an
inmate is deemed a danger to
society.
Breivik did not appear to
have any family or support-
ers in court. His parents, who
are divorced, did not attend the
hearing. His father, Jens Breivik,
answered when The Associated
Press called his home in France
onyesterday.
"I don't want to comment on
anything," he said before hang-
ing up:
Anne Marita Milde, a psy-
chology professor at the Uni-
versity of Bergen, said Breivik's
tears during the- video show
he's not completely "flattened"
emotionally - even though they
didn't come when you might
have expected them.
"He may in many areas be
emotionally flattened, that he
doesn't display emotion and so
on, but it's not all or nothing
here -there are facets within
behavior," she said.

Defense Department
says 86 percent
of sexual assaults
unreported
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Defense Secretary Leon Panet-
ta on yesterday announced new
steps to combat sexual assaults
in the military, with serious
offenses such as rape and forc-
ible sodomy subject to a court-
martial review at the authority
level of Army colonel or Navy,
captain.
"Sexual assault has no place
in the military. It is'a violation
of everything that the U.S. mili-
tary stands for," Panetta told a
Capitol Hill news conference
after a closed-door, meeting
with members of the House
Armed Services Committee
who have pushed for the Penta-
gon to take aggressive steps to
stop sexual assaults. '
The Pentagon said Friday
that the number of reported
sexual assaults had increased
slightly last year, with 3,192
cases involving service mem-
bers as either victims or per-
petrators. But the Defense
Department also has esti-
mated that 86 percent of sex-
ual assaults go unreported, a
reflection of the fear some have
for the prosecutorial system or
their own standing in the ser-
vice.
Panetta said that as Pen-
tagon chief he would issue a
directive changing the way
cases are handled. A higher

authority within the military
now will review the most seri-
ous cases, ensuring that cases
remain within the chain of the
command and leaders are held
responsible.
He said he would work with
Congress on legislation imple-
menting several other initia-
tives, including creation of
special victims units within
the services, allowing National
Guard' and reserve members
to remain on active duty after
they file a complaint and an
explanation of sexual assault
policies to all service members.
within 14 days of their entry in
the military.
These initiatives are likely
to be included in the sweep-
ing defense bill that the House
Armed Services panel will be,
craftig beginning next week.
"This is a strong package. It
is essential, we believe, to being
able to prevent and respond to
the crime of sexual assault,"
Panetta said. "There's no sil-
ver bullet when it comes to this
issue. But what is required is
that everyone, from the secre-
tary to the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs all the way down, every
the command level, be sensitive
to this issue, be aware that they
bear the responsibility to take
action on these cases. The most
important thing we can do is
prosecute the offenders."
Panetta, who was joined by
Army Gen. Martin Dempsey,
the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, mentioned the
steps the Pentagon has taken
previously, including the cre-

ation of a 24/7 hotline and the
selection of a two-star general
to head the Sexual Assault Pre-
vention and Response Office.
"Our men and women in
uniform should not fear their
fellow service members," Rep.
Mike Turner, R-Ohio, told
reporters at the news con-
ference. Rep. Niki Tsongas,
D-Mass., talked of a "renewed
commitment to address this
grievous issue." Rep. Loretta
Sanchez, D-Calif., focused on
treating victims with respect.
In its annual report to Con-
gress, the Defense Department
said there were 3,192 reports
of sexual assault involving ser-
vice members as either victims
or perpetrators at the end of
September 2011, a 1 percent
increase over the previous year.
The number of reported cases
in 2010 was 3,158 assaults, in
the previous year it was 3,230.
The report also found that
courts martial were used more.
frequently now in disciplining
offenders. Of the 791 military
sexual offenders punished last
year, 62 percent faced a court
martial. That compares with
52 percent in 2010 and 30 per-
cent in 2007. The proportion
of cases in which less severe
forms of discipline are pursued,
such as administrative actions
and discharges, has declined in
that same period.
"Sexual assault is a crime
that has no place in the Depart-
ment of Defense, and the
department's leadership has a
zero-tolerance policy against
it," the report said.

Trip marred by
allegations against
Secret Service
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi-
dent Barack Obama is returning
to his familiar agenda of righting
the U.S. economy and winning a
second term, wrapping up three
days of Latin American summitry
that yielded mixed results and
were clouded by a Secret Service
scandal
Domestic issues are imme-
diately on tap, with the Senate
scheduled to vote Monday on
Obama's proposal to increase
taxes on millionaires. The pro-'
posal stands little chance of pass-

ing Congress, but Obama has cast
it as an election-year theme as
he seeks to paint sharp contrasts
between himself and his likely
Republican challenger, Mitt
Romney.
Obama returned to Washing-
ton late Sunday with a key free
trade deal with Colombiaready to
be fully enforced next monthand"
with important face time with'
Latin American leaders that can-
not hurt his diplomatic outreach.
But the weekend trip to Carta-
gena, Colombia, for the sixth
Summit of the Americas also
underscored old and new fissures
that exist between the United
States and its southern neighbors,
from the U.S. isolation of Cuba
to calls by some Latin American

leaders to defang the violent drug
cartels by legalizing drugs.
The trip was clouded by
unseemly allegations against
Secret Service personnel and
military service members work-
ing on security in Cartagena
ahead of Obama's arrival. Obama,
at a press conference in Carta-
gena, said that if the accusations,
proved true "of course I'll be
angry."
The Secret Service sent 11
agents home and placed them on
leave for misconduct as the agen-
cy investigates what happened.
Five members of the military
working with the Secret Ser-
vice were confined to quarters,
pending an investigation into an
alleged prostitution scandal.

State Rep. Bob Genetski

ties "that will ill affect Michigan

"We envision an architectural-
ly-detailed facade withopenspace
at either end of the structure that
will contain park-like landscaping
with trees and water features for
storm water management which
may also be used for irrigation
and reducing storm runoff to the
river," Slottow wrote.
When the University proposed
the Wall Street structure in 2008,
residents living in Ann Arbor's
nearby Lower Town neighbor-
hood expressed concerns about
the structure's construction. At
the time, Ann Arbor Mayor John
Hieftje asked the regents to look
for alternatives to placing the
parking structure in the area,
which has high traffic.
"We would like you to work
with us, to step back - it doesn't
have to be for a long time - and
take a look," Hieftje said. "Is there
another way to get people into the
Wall Street area except creating
two new parking structures there,
in what could become a very con-
gested area?"
UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS
TO EXPAND INTENSIVE
CARE UNITS
In a communication with the
regents; Slottow and Ora Pesco-
vitz, the executive vice president
for medical affairs, wrote that the
vacated space in the former C.S.
Mott Children's Hospital allows
for expansion of the intensive care
unit to meet growing demand.
"This project will renovate
approximately 163,000 gross
square feet for a new adult oper-
ating room suite of eight rooms,
a new imaging suite, 95 general
patient care beds, and 25 intensive
care beds to serve primarily Neu-

Singh announced shortly after
Friday's vote that she will not seek
another appeal.
As per the CSG constitution,

Parikh and Hashwi will be sworn
in on April 23, 10 days following
the final decision.
Parikh said he is wary of the
work before him, but looks for-
ward to beginning his term.
"We won this in the eyes of the
students; we won this in the eyes
of the judicial process," Parikh
said. "I understand that I'm not
going to get much sleep this year,
but I'm really excited to work for
the students."
Parikh said regardless of how
students voted; he was glad so
many people participated in stu-

"Apparently, some sort of pro-
test or some sort of community-
organizing that was happening
with students there is what the
Legislature is reacting to," Staller
said.
Senate Assembly member Ed
Rothman, a statistics professor,
said a response from the faculty
body to the state government
should be broad and focus on the
University's independence rather
than a reaction to the specific leg-
islation.
"I hope that if we have a
response, it will not have too
narrow a focus on this particu-
lar issue; that we say we are an
autonomous unit, get off our
backs," Rothman said.
Rothman added that the
University should work with
other institutions in the state to
increase efforts to overturn the
targeted legislation.

"Perhaps we could have a big-
ger impact if we come together
with other schools and colleges
to formulate a particular posi-
tion that says we are indepen-
dent, autonomous organizations,"
Rothman said.
Barbara Garavaglia, chair of
the Senate Assembly's Govern-
ment Relations Advisory Com-
mittee, said the University is
working on publicizing its image
as a research institution to avoid
similar legislative issues in the
future.
"We have to be cognizant of
the fact that state legislature is
comprised of men and women
who are from Michigan - many
in smaller areas all around the
state - and one of the things we
are looking at is to discuss ways in
which we can have more of a PR
presence in the state," Garavaglia
said.


and Pescovitz wrote.
About 104,000 square feet
will also be repurposed for use as
office space in the new C.S. Mott
Children's and Von Voigtlander
Women's Hospitals. According to
Slottow and Pescovitz, renova-
tion work will primarily focus on
architectural and utility upgrades
to prepare the facility for its new
purpose.
Slottow and Pescovitz wrote
that the architectural firm Hobbs
will design the renovation. The
project is expected to cost approx-
imately $163 million.
LIBRARY RENOVATIONS
CONTINUE
In a separate communication
to the regents, Slottow request-
ed that the regents approve the
second phase of renovations to
the Law Quadrangle, which are
scheduled to focus on Hutchins
Hall and the William W. Cook
Legal Research Library, the Law
School's main library.
"Thescopeofthisprojectfocus-
es on the renovation and updating
of the vacated spaces as well as the
overall organization of the Law
School, encompassing approxi-
mately 30,000 gross square foot-
age of space," Slottow wrote.
The library, originally con-
structed in 1931, is due to undergo
a series of electrical and mechani-
cal updates. Slottow also wrote
that the approximately $7-million
project willbe completed in phas-
es to avoid disruptions duringthe
school year, and it is expected to
be completed during the summer
of 2013.
In another communication,
Slottow requested the approval of
a $55-million renovation to the A.
Alfred Taubman Health Sciences
Library.
"By moving a large portion of
less frequently used library col-
lections off-site, the University
is freeing up nearly two floors of
the building for higher priority

academic needs," Slottow wrote.
"The renovated building will
house a smaller library collection
and increased health sciences
instructional space, including
a clinical skills and simulation
suite, and space for computing,
study, and faculty and student
services."
The project will renovate
approximately 137,000 square
feet of the building focusing on
electrical, mechanical and archi-
tectural work to prepare the
library for academic use.
UNIVERSITY TO CREATE
NEW MASTER OF MEDICAL
SCIENCE GRADUATE PRO-
GRAM
Aside from construction and
renovations, University Provost
Philip Hanlon and Slottow also
wrote a communication to the
regents requesting their approval
to create a master's of Medical
Science program.
"The purpose of the degree is to
grant formal academic recogni-
tion by the Medical School to stu-
dents who successfully complete
and demonstrate competency in
the first two years of the medical
school curriculum, but are unable
to complete the requirements for
a Doctor of Medicine degree due
to personal or administrative rea-
sons," Hanlon and Slottow wrote.
Hanlon and Slottow wrote that
no student would be admitted to
the Medical School for the sole
purpose of obtaining the mas-
ter's of Medical Science degree.
If approved, the Medical School
plans to award the degree to two
currently disenrolled students,
and in the future, it would only
consider students who apply for
admission in the program within
12 months of disenrolling.
If approved by the regents, the
degree will need further approval
from the President's Council of
State Universities of Michigan
before it can be instated.

residence hall, has was also reno-
vated to make the space more
welcoming for student use.
Other common areas include
a laundry room, music practice
rooms, study rooms, classrooms
and student lounges.
University Housing spokes-
man Peter Logan noted that
students from nearby residence
halls, including as Couzens Resi-
dence Hall and Mosher-Jordan
Residence Hall, will have easier
access to Alice Lloyd through
a new entrance from Palmer
Field.
"By promoting more of the
entrance to the building on the
Palmer Field side, it builds on
that whole neighborhood expe-
rience that we've been work-
ing into the Residential Life
Initiatives," Logan said. "It's
not about a series of very dis-
tinct and isolated buildings, but
creating more of a flow among
residence halls that share a
neighborhood."
Logan said 520 students will
live in Alice Lloyd next year, 175
of which will be a part of the
Lloyd Hall Scholars Program,
which is a living and learning
community for students inter-
ested in literature and the arts.
Yurk said the design team
tried to use environmentally-
friendly products when pos-
sible, as it has done with other
recently renovated residence
halls such as Couzens. He said
the building also has motion-
sensor lighting throughout the
corridors, lounges, bathrooms
and other common areas.
The design team also
installed low water-flow appli-
ances and an energy recovery
unit, which harvests hot and
cold air from showers and bath-
rooms to limit the residents'
water consumption. Insulation
on the exterior walls has also
been added to further improve
energy conservation.
Yurk said University Housing
is looking forward to seeing stu-
dent reactions to the renovated
space.
"Every time we finish a proj-
ect, we're excited," Yurk said.

"We hope that we addressed the
concerns that we heard in the
focus groups and the surveys ...
(and that) the students find (the
changes) exciting, beneficial,
useful, both from a serious point
of view of studying, but also
from a leisure point of view."
Last night, the Housing
Design and Planning team
hosted an event to thank stu-
dents who live in Mosher-Jor-
dan and Couzens for tolerating
the inconvenience posed by the
construction in Alice Lloyd.
Students had the opportunity to
ask design team members ques-
tions about the changes.
LSA freshman Andrew Loeb,
a member of LHSP who lives in
Couzens, said there were only a
few instances in which the con-
struction directly affected him,
noting that sometimes loud
noises woke him up when he
tried to sleep in and occasional-
ly dust from the work blew into
his window.
Loeb will live in Alice Lloyd
next year as part of LHSP, and
said though Couzens has been a
great home for the program, he
is excited about moving into the
new Alice Lloyd.
"I'm reallylookingforward to
what it looks like," Loeb said. "I
was really happy to find out that
we would be going back there
next year."
Art & Design freshman Grace
Ludmer said the construction is
being done right outside of her
window but the negative effects
are minor.
"It was not nearly as bad as
I thought it would be," Ludmer
said. "It wasn't noisy; it never
woke me up, but it definitely
was an eyesore, and it made it
inconvenient to walk to Mo-Jo,
but nothing awful."
East Quad Residence Hall
will be the next residence hall
to receive major renovations,
Logan said. Designers plan
to improve the first floor and
ensure that student living cor-
ridors are private and separated
from Residential College facili-
ties.
"Now we have been able to
properly separate (the Residen-
tial College) but keep the com-
munity spaces contiguous and
open to the Residential Col-

lege," Logan said.
Logan added that designers
have been planning to revamp
the residence hall's mechani-
cal aspects and infrastructure.
There will be also be new wire-
less Internet, plumbing, elec-
trical, heating, cooling and fire
suppression systems.
Upon completion, Logan
said East Quad will be the final
upgrade to the University's
residential fire suppression sys-
tems. He also said East Quad
will contain similar sustainabil-
ity features to Alice Lloyd.
Yurk added that the complete
renovation planned for the din-
ing facility at East Quad will
most likely have the biggest
impact on students who live and
work in East Quad. Currently,
there are two separate dining
halls, but after renovations, they
will be integrated, with new
additions to variety of foods
offered, including a vegetarian
and vegan station.
Logan said renovations to
residence halls preserve exist-
ing character while updating
the buildings to meet students'
needs.
"It's a way of bringing a
new life to our Heritage Halls
and respecting the tradition-
al designs and architectural
uniqueness of those buildings,"
Logan said. "There is always
some new dynamic to this reno-
vation. It's not simply restora-
tion - that wouldn't serve the
purposes of contemporary and
future students."
Logan added that the hous-
ing team is aware that there are
more buildings that have yet to
be upgraded to keep up with
students' needs, but said plans
aren't official regarding the
next project.
"I know it won't end with
East Quad," he said. "But where
it goes after East Quad is yet to
be decided."
Yurk added that Baits II Resi-
dence Halls will also receive
additions and updates. The
halls will be renovated with
improved community learn-
ing centers, a new fire suppres-
sion system, additional music
and media rooms and updated
lounge facilities, house kitchens
and furniture.
Pickard argued that Porter
shouldn't have involved herself
in the matter.
"I don't think it's her respon-
sibility at all because the case
didn't even involve her," Pickard
said."
Though he believes he was
wrongly accused, Pickard main-
tained that he believes that the
girl mentioned in the initial
e-mail was a victim of sexual
assault.
"I want my name cleared, and
I hope the girl gets her justice,"
Pickard said.
In an interview yesterday,
Porter reiterated thatshe regrets
sending the e-mail.
"I'mvery sorry thatthis could
have any sort of negative effect
on him," Porter said. "It was a
mistake, and I am very sorry
about it, and I'm willingto admit
that"
Porter's e-mail was followed
by another Greek e-mail in late
March sent by LSA sophomore
Lauren Leibach, accusing LSA

junior Omar Hashwi, then a
candidate for Central Student
Government vice president, of
being homophobic and anti-
Semitic.
Porter said members of Greek
life and other people sending out
mass e-mails should be cautious
of the content of their messages.
"It's a matter of - myself
included, obviously - just being
aware of what you're sending
out there and realizing that it
could get to a bigger audience
than you originally intended,"
Porter said.


dent government. He added that
even if students did not vote, he
looks forward to engaging them
in future CSG activities and elec-
tions.
"Student government is irrele-
vant without the student, Parikh
said. "My focus is on returning
student government back to the
student."
He added that the election
commission should be lauded for
their dedication to ensuring the
election's results were fair and
accurate.
"(They) spent over five times
the hours they thought that they
would be putting in," Parikh said.
"Despite final examinations and
other commitments, their dedi-
cation to this university and the
ideals of justice is something I
personally admire."
Though elections ended in
March, the ongoing appeal did
not allow Parikh to take office
at the regularly scheduled time.

Exiting CSG President DeAndree
Watson said time to organize
before the end of the semester is
valuable for the CSG president,
which may present Parikh and
Hashwi with some challenges.
"I think he's going to have to
make some quick decisions in
the next few weeks to get some
things in place in order to be fully
functional and effective over the
summer," Watson said.
Watson added that he was
pleased his extended term was
coming to an end, if only to allow
Parikh time to prepare for the
work at hand.
"I'm glad that we finally got
some closure, and that we can
move forward (and) allow the
next administration to come in
and get busy," Watson said.
Parikh said he plans to stay in
Ann Arbor over the summer and
declined an internship to focus
on his presidential responsibili-
ties.

tor for philanthropic outreach
' and education, said it's important
to honor all students who consti-
tute the University's diverse com-
munity, including those who have
passed away.
"When I think about com-
munity ... I think about how all
these individuals come together
and share their talents and love to

create what is Michigan," Walsh
said. "I think it's really important
to take time to honor those stu-
dents, especially (those) who have
passed away while they were here
and part of this community."
Leroy Fleming Jr., Patrick
Fleming's father, said he was
thankful for the memorial service.
"We think that it is wonderful
that the University is doing this for
our family and for the other fami-
lies," Fleming said. "I'm sure that
Patrick and the other kids would

love this."
Patrick's mother, Linda Flem-
ing, added that the service assisted
in providingclosure and a support
system for all the families and
friends.
"I think it helped for the Uni-
versity to get all the families
together, and (it helps) to know
that we are all going through the
same thing, so it's not like we are
here all alone," she said.
Scott Boerma, director of the
marching band, showed his sup-

port for Fleming at the event, and
described how his death affected
the band's dynamic.
"A group like (the marching
band) shares so much, so many
hours and so much blood, sweat
and tears in their pursuit of excel-
lence," Boerma said. "It was an
occasion that reminded us the
importance of working together
with people and taking care of the
people around you."
Business graduate student
Tiago Godoi said he attended the

service in memory of his friend
Serrano, who he had not been
able to properly send off earlier.
"The service is important for
us because we never got to say
goodbye to him," Godoi said.
"They took his body to Brazil, so
we never got a moment - a cer-
emony - where we could actu-
ally gather and celebrate or honor
him."
LSA senior Stephanie Garbari-
no, a friend and former roommate
of Jordan Harris, said Harris will

be remembered in many ways,
including her ability to reach out
to others.
"If you knew her, you (would)
immediately fall in love with her
because she was probably the
nicest person you've ever met in
your entire life," Garbarino said.
"She was so generous, kind and
basically she'd change your life
... she didn't have a mean bone in
her body, and I think we'll always
remember her as the person who
taught us to love life."

University students celebrated
throughout campus after Barack
Obama was elected the 44th president
oftheUnitedStates.Withthecampaign
underway, the University's chapter of
the College Democrats quadrupled in
size during the fall semester in 2008
and was forced to turn down interested
students because it didn't have the nec-
essary capacity for the 300 who turned
out for the first mass meeting.
Smoking Ban
University administrators an-
nounced a smoking ban for all three
campuses. Reasons for the ban includ-
ed the hope of reducing health risks
from smoking. There was the addi-
tional benefit of reducing health care
costs for University faculty. The ban
triggered changes to the Statement of
the Student Rights and Responsibilities
handbook. Despite opposition, admin-
istrators stayed positive in light ofother
campuses that already implemented
similar bans with successful outcomes.

Students compare
action 50 years ago
with modern efforts
By STEPHANIE BERLIANT
Daily StaffReporter
Oct. 13, 2010 - Members of
the University community gath-
ered on the steps of the Michi-
gan Union at 2 a.m. on Thursday,
marking 50 years to the moment
and place that then-presidential
candidate John F. Kennedy deliv-
ered his speech that would even-
tually inspire the formation of the
Peace Corps.
There was evena slight drizzle
as the event got underway, just as
there was that night 50 years ago.
Despite the rain, about 1,500
students, faculty and other Ann
Arbor residents gathered for the
2 a.m. celebration Wednesday
night, officials said. The event
featured a variety of speakers
involved in the Peace Corps and
other community service orga-
nizations talking about what's
changed over the past 50 years
in regard to global service and
what's stayed consistent - mainly
the University's strong culture of
community service.
The origins of the Peace
Corps have become engraved in
the University's history, proud-
ly recounted by tour guides to
prospective students and their
parents in their first days on
campus. The story of Kennedy's
impromptu, middle-of-the-night
pit stop at the Union to address
students and his words encour-
aging students to serve develop-
ing nations abroad still resonate
within the University commu-
nity today, as they did with stu-
dents in 1960.
Less than a year after Kennedy
first proposed the idea, the first
group of Peace Corps volunteers
was sent to Ghana and Tanzania
in August 1961.
John Greisberger, director of
the University's International
Center who was involved in
II
s

planning the 2 a.m. event and
spoke at the start of the occa-
sion, said in an interview on
Monday that the story of Kenne-
dy's spur-of-the-moment speech
continues to captivate students
and encourage them to serve
abroad.
"Kennedy asked students 50
years ago to use education for a
higher purpose," Greisberger said
on Monday. "I believe that pur-
pose is serving others in develop-
ing nations to help bring a better
way of life. If we have more peo-
ple with the basics in life, that's
the foundation for peace in this
world."
Al Guskin, who heard Ken-
nedy speak on the Union steps as
a University graduate student 50
years ago, returned Wednesday
night to talk about how he went
from just another student in the
crowd to being a key member of
a team that put the Peace Corps
into action.
Guskin explained in his speech
why University students reacted
so strongly to Kennedy's proposi-
tion. He credited students inother
parts of the country participating
in Civil Rights Movement sit-ins
for bringing social justice to the
forefront of Americans' minds.
"I'm proud of what happened,
but it would not have happened
without four courageous students
in North Carolina," Guskin said,
referring to members of the 1960
Greensboro sit-in in North Caro-
lina.
Arriving in Ann Arbor straight
from a trip to Ghana last night,
Aaron Williams, director of the
Peace Corps, encouraged stu-
dents to serve, calling the Univer-
sity "Peace Corps territory."
"This bold experiment, the
Peace Corps, still calls out to you,"
Williams said. "Now this is your
time."
LSA senior Steven Weinberg,
co-founder of the national stu-
dent organization Will Work for
Food, spoke about the similari-
ties between students' attitudes
toward community service today
and 50 years ago.

Will Work for Food was estab
lished at the University in 2007
and has since spread to 30 col-
leges and high schools across the
country, Weinberg said in his
speech. Participants of Will Work
for Food collect monetary pledges
for charities around the world in
exchange for completing local
volunteer work.
During his speech, Weinberg
also highlighted the parallel of
the formation of Will Work for
Food after Bill Clinton spoke,
at the University's 2007 Spring
Commencement ceremony and
the formation of the Peace Corps
after Kennedy's inspirational
speech.
"Similar to the speech Kenne-
dy gave on these steps, President
Clinton's speech had an underly-
ing call to action for those in the
crowd to live as global citizens,"
Weinberg said.
Weinberg collaborated with
friends and faculty members to
form Will Work for Food and took
a year off from school to solidify
the organization. He said he is not
alone in his commitment to com-
munity service.
Pat Wand, a former Peace
Corps volunteer in Colombia dur-
ing the 1960s and a University -
alum, who was in attendance at
the 2 a.m. event, said the celebra-
tion made her think back to her
own experience volunteering
abroad.
She said she remembers not
only the excitement of the orga-
nization's establishment, but also
the criticism that it faced during
its beginnings.
"It reminds me of how tenu-
ous the whole program was and
for many years people were very
critical of it and how dangerous
it was for them to send young
people abroad because they'
would make the United States
look bad and we showed them
up and made it look better than
anyone has ever made it look,"
Wand said.

Students rejoice on the Diag after Obamas win in the
2008 presidential election.

Hanlon named provost
Phil Hanlon gave up his position as
Donald J. Lewis Professor of Mathemat-
ics when he was appointed the Univer-
sity's provost. Working his way through
University positions since 1986, Hanlon
climbed from an associate professor of
mathematics to a full professor before
shifting to administrative positions.
Former University provost Prof. James
Duderstadt said he thinks the key to
being a successful provost is in the rela-
tionship with the University president.
Porch Upholstery Ban
After much opposition from students
and multiple voting postponements, Ann
Arbor City Council unanimously passed
the ordinance banning upholstered fur-
niture from porches in October of 2010.
Those caught with upholstered furni-
ture on their porches could be fined up
to $1000. City Council explained the rea-
soning for the ban and the fine amounts
was about campus safety. Ann Arbor Fire
Marshall Kathleen Chamberlain said
violators would be issued warningbefore
an official fine was given to them.

Children's Hospital Opening
After $754 million were spent
and countless hours of planning and
construction were completed, 170
patients were moved to the new C.S.
Mott Children's Hospital building.
Three-hundred volunteers joined
thousands of staff members to help
transfer patients to the new building.
Before the transition to the new
building was completed, the new
building held its first birth on Dec. 4, Zv

Rick Snyder replaced Democratic pre-

Stem Cell Research

in a new stem cell research project in
collaboration with the U.S. National
Institutes of Health. The purpose of
the project isto research disease treat-
ments. The University has recently dealt
with potential obstacles for the pro-
gram from the House Appropriations
Subcommittee on Higher Education
- including potential budget cuts from
the state.
GSR A Debate
A bill preventing graduate student
research assistants from unionizing
passed in early March. The bill has
started a debate between state Repub-
licans and Democrats over whether or
not GSRAs at the University can vote to
form a union. The bill - which amends
the Public Employment Relations Act336
of 1947 to identify GSRAs as students,
instead of public employees - forced
Democrats to criticize Republicans for
their justification of immediate effect,
despite the former tactics of both Demo-
crats and Republicans.

The road to recovery
4/5/2009
A t this point, the auto industry's cries for help are nothing new. Chrysler,
Ford and General Motors are struggling and in desperate need of govern-
ment assistance. A few months ago, the federal-government promised to
help these companies if they meet certain conditions for revamping their business-
es. While the companies struggle to accommodate the government's demands, the
government continues to disparage the industry's progress, going so far as to force
out GM CEO Rick Wagoner. If the government is going to take such an active role
in the industry's management, then it must outline a clear vision to resuscitate the
industry while assuming the responsibility for seeing the crisis to its end.

Our American contradiction

10/12/2010
As I think about the results
of last week's election, I've
found myself in a sort of
haze trying to
piece together
where we stand
as a society.
It's not that
I'm surprised
that the politi-
cal pendulum
swung to the
right last Tues- MATTHEW
day. Anyone GREEN
who's picked up
a newspaper in
the past few months could've seen
that coming. But what's troubling
is that this post-election political
atmosphere has left us with fewer
answers - and more confusion -
about our identity asa nation.
There's an African American in
the White House, but come Janu-
ary there won't be a single person
of color in the U.S. Senate. Women
will constitute roughly the same
proportion in Congress as they do
now - slightly fewer than twenty
percent. But with more Repub-
lican women than before, the
already tenuous legislative sup-
port for reproductive rights will
probably wane. And with the elec-
tion of David Cicilline (D-R.I.) to
the U.S. House of Representatives,
there will be more openly gay con-
gresspeople next January than
ever before. Nevertheless, our next
Congress will be even less likely
than our current one to support the
rights of the LGBTQ community.
Contradictions have certainly
been part of American politics ever
since our slaveholding forefathers
tried to ingrain freedom and equality
as part of our political discourse. But
as we enter into another chapter of
democracy, the contradictions before
us are particularly confounding.
And it's not just in terms of
civil rights. The New York Times

reported last week that while the
wealthiest 1 percent of Americans
controlled 9 percent of all income
in 1976, that same 1 percent con-
trols 24 percent of income today.
Times columnist Nicholas Kristof
went on to say that, "From 1980 to
2005, more than four-fifths of the
total increase in American incomes
went to the richest 1 percent." Yet,
in spite of this backdrop, our cur-
rent lame-duck Congress seems
poised to extend the Bush-era tax
cuts for the wealthiest Americans.
And a more conservative Congress
will probably continue to neglect
this extraordinary income inequal-
ity, focusing instead on creating
new tax breaks for the upper crust.
It doesn't matter that the motives
of these politicians are perfectly
plain to see. The point is that as a
nation, we're constantly pulled right
and left and the divisions between
us are wide and confusing. It's
increasingly difficult to say who's
right and what actions our politi-
cians ought totake. If there was any
question before the election, Presi-
dent Barack Obama now officially
has the hardest job in the country,
as the head of a democracy thatcan't
figure out who or what it is.
As I ponder today's 92nd anni-
versary of the end of World War
One, I have to wonder how far
we've come since that time. It was
during that era - another period of
confusion and gross contradiction
- that President Woodrow Wilson
enunciated his dream "to make the
world safe for democracy." And
ever since, Wilson's words have
hung like a self-awarded medal on'
the breast of American foreign pol-
icy. But let's not forget that when
Wilson uttered those words, no
women and only some black men
could actually participate in the
democracy that the president had
hoped to bring to the world.
In the past century, we've fought
wars - which continue today - for

the stated purpose of defending free-
dom and popular rule. And for this
column at least, I'll give our govern-
ment the benefit of the doubt that
their campaign for democracy was
well intentioned. Yet, it seems rather
obvious by now that at least part of
the reason why we've failed at pro-
moting democracy abroad is that our
own democratic ethos at home is so
ambiguous. We act on preferences
rather than principles. The result is a
culture of contradiction.
We musts
participate in
politics.
In the face of such inconsistency,
exemplified by this most recent
election, it would be easy to grow
disillusioned about politics or about
our ability to bring about social
change. Indeed, our politicians
have largely failed us. And even if
you're happy about this past elec-
tion, you're probably not optimistic
about political progress following
anytime soon.
As students at the University,
we're presented with the inspiring
and daunting reality that in a couple
decades or sooner, we - or at least
our contemporaries - will replace
the current ineffectual generation
of politicians. Rather than getting
turned off from politics, we need to
pay more attention than ever. It will
be up to us to answer the complex
questions that our parents' genera-
tion have created or ignored. And as
we form our opinions and consider
different careers, more than ever, we
have a responsibility to do just that.
-Matthew Green is graduating
with the class of 2012.

Last Wednesday, GM's Wagoner resigned
at the urging of President Barack Obama after
a presidential task force claimed that GM had
not made significant progress in its attempts
to restructure. Wagoner was replaced by Chief
Operating Officer Fritz Henderson, granting
GM 60 more days of federal funding. At the
conclusion of this period, GM is expected to
have put forth significant plans to restructure.
The federal governmentwill cut off aid if these
demands are not met. The government also
told Chrysler it has only 30 days to complete a
merger with Fiat SpA before federal aid will be
discontinued.
While the possible side effects of the auto
industry's collapse have been widely discussed
for the state and the nation, students may not
realize just how much is at stake for the Uni-
versity as well. Automakers like Ford and GM
contribute to the many programs and schol-
arships at the University.In addition, many
parents of in-state students work for the auto
industry - or for businesses dependent upon
the auto industry - impacting their ability to
afford tuition. And University graduates often
go on to work for the auto industry, meaning
these car companies' troubles directly impact
students' ability to find jobs after college.
In light of the auto industry's importance
to the University - as well as the rest of the
country - it's important that the federal gov-

ernment make a concerted effort to rescue the
industry. And while the government did agree
to support these failing automakers, it needs
to do more than simply make demands and
threaten to cut off aid if the companies don't
restructure quickly enough. Having involved
itself in the problem, the Obama administra-
tion now has a responsibility to the auto indus-
try and to the people dependent upon the jobs
the industry sustains. Forcing out Wagoner
was onlyan acceptable move ifthegovernment
is prepared to offer better leadership for GM
and the industry.
But the government doesn't seem to have a
clear plan to fix the problem, instead placing
mandate after mandate on the companies that
won't necessarily create positive outcomes.
The auto industry needs a long-term solution
to its problems, and the federal government
has yet to produce such a solution.
The government knows what the stakes are
- it understands the dire repercussions for
leaving these companies for dead. It's evident
that millions of Michigan residents, including
University students are dependent on these
companies.
But just understanding the stakes isn't
enough. It's time forthe federal government to
offer a coherent plan. Having fired Wagoner,
Obama has implicitly agreed to do a better job
than he did.

OWS is socialist, so what?

10/18/2011
A ayoumayhaveheard,
some greedy low-
life punks inhabit
Wall Street
right now.
No, not
the execu-
tives and
bankers
who tor-
pedoed the
American
economy DAR-WEI
and caused CHEN
a global
finan-
cial crisis. Those people are
honest hardworking folks.
It's the Occupy Wall Street
protesters. According to
many in Republican circles,
these people are lazy social-
ists looking for government
handouts. Fox News pun-
dit and conservative media
ratings giant Sean Hannity
said this to an OWS pro-
tester: "You don't believe in
liberty, you don't believe in
freedom." He also threw in a
"Marxist" charge in there for
good measure and probably
said something about fas-
cism and socialism since he
and his Fox cohorts use all of
those terms interchangeably.
The funny thing is, Hanni-
ty and other conservatives
don't seem to realize that
OWS is actually similar to his
beloved Tea Party. Both are
angry about the various bail-
outs over the past few years -
albeit for somewhat different
reasons - and want to have
their voices heard in the polit-
ical process (the Tea Party
has since gotten off econom-
ics and decided to focus on
God, guns and gays, but stick
with me here). I know Tea
Party supporters are read-
ing this and thinking: "You
liberals slammed us for our
protests, so if our movements
are so similar, the OWS move-
ment should be slammed too!"
However, no one is criticiz-
ing the Tea Party movement
for the fact that the party's
supporters wanted to express
their opinions - the main

gripe people have is with its
policies and actions. TeaParty
folks are the ones that brought
guns to see President Barack
Obama and shouted racial and
gay slurs at Democratic law-
makers during the health care
reform debate. More recently,
they cheered Republican
Gov. Rick Perry's executions,
applauded the idea of letting
an uninsured sick man die
and jeered a soldier for being
openly gay.
So what does the OWS
movement want, anyway?
The message from OWS pro-
testers has not been stream-
lined into a few cliche talking
points because no leader has
emerged yet. Nevertheless,
the general complaints are
that corporate influence in
politics is too pervasive, the
financial system is rigged for
the rich and Wall Street is
not being held accountable
for its actions in destroying
the economy. Sounds popu-
list (or socialist, depending
on perspective) enough, but
top Republican presidential
hopefuls are already taking
their shots.
GOP presidential candidate
Herman Cain said this to OWS
protesters in an interview
with The Wall Street Journal:
"If you don't have a job and
you're not rich, blame your-
self." Hmmm ... maybe he's
right - people need to assume
more personal responsibility.
Wait, what if you're a public
school teacher in Wisconsin
who earns a starting salary of
barely more than $25,000 to
do the important work of edu-
cating the next generation?
Or how about a private who
has served in the Army for six
years and still receives annual
basic pay of less than $20,000
to defend our nation? Are they
at fault for choosing a profes-
sion that pays so poorly? Next
time I see a teacher or a sol-
dier, I will be sure to tell them
"blame yourself."
GOP frontrunner Mitt
Romney has also demonized
the protesters, saying they
are inciting "class warfare."

He is trying to say that the
lower and middle classes are
waging "class warfare" on the
upper class, butI got confused
because I thought the state-
ment makes more sense the
other way around. Check out
these statistics: The United
States has the 39th-most
unequal income distribution
in the world, behind almost all
Western countries - incomes
are actually more equal in
Iran. And it's no surprise
because the wealthiest 1 per-
cent in the U.S. earns almost
one-quarter of all income.
Remember, if you don't like
these numbers, you're fascist.
And socialist. And whatever
that last one is.
OWS wants
accountability
from Wall St.
The main point I want
to make is OWS is a move-
ment that almost everyone
should be able to appreci-
ate and that even some of the
richest (like Warren Buffet
and Dallas Mavericks owner
Mark Cuban) are supporting.
Conservatives will deride it
as socialist, but if you think
about it, who isn't a socialist?
Unless you are against every
form of government wealth
redistribution (like taxes
going toward roads, highways,
schools, police, firefight-
ing, military, environmen-
tal protection, health care,
food inspection, etc.), you are
socialist at some level. It's just
a label. The people at OWS
want the government and
Wall Street to be accountable
to the vast majority of people
in this country, not a ruling
elite class. If that idea makes
me socialist, sign me up.

Change will not come if we wait for
some other person or.some other time.
We are the ones we've been waiting for.
We are the change that we seek."

'U' supports Chris Armstrong

9

9/30/2010
Activity over the last few months has brought into
sharp focus the unwavering commitment of the Univer-
sity community to social justice and human rights for
all. Students, staff and faculty have rallied to supportthe
elected president of the University student body, who
has been viciously targeted by an individual because of
his sexual orientation.
The reaction by the University community has been
exactly what we would expect from the "leaders-and
best": overwhelmingly supportive of Chris Armstrong,
president of the Michigan Student Assembly.
Likewise, Armstrong and his fellow MSA members
have reacted to this unwanted attention by holdingtheir
heads high, ignoring the blogger's taunts and carrying
on with their ambitious MSA agenda for the comingyear.
We commend them for their responsible approach. An
important value of this campus is the free flow of ideas
and opinions. As a community of scholars we simultane-
ously preserve and create knowledge.
We ask difficult questions, challenge each others' best
thinking, sometimes change our minds and other times
agree to respectfully disagree. While living and working
together we also strive to create a campus environment
where civility, respect and inclusivity are of paramount
importance. This is a place where individuals' rights to
have their personal identities respected and understood

is as sacred as other constitutionally protected ideals.
As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. noted in 1963, "Injus-
tice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are
caught in an inescapable network of mutuality... What-
ever affects one directly, affects all indirectly."
Freedom of speech and expression do not include
behaviors that target, harass, threaten or defame oth-
ers. As a campus community we must continue to "Stand
Up, Step In and Speak Out" against the repeated vitri-
olic attacks on any one of us. Hateful speech can only be
effectively countered by different speech.
We applaud those individuals and student organi-
zations - on our campus and elsewhere - that have
taken the opportunity to counter hateful speech with
different speech and express support for Chris. A uni-
fied show of support demonstrating that acts of bigotry
cannot take root here is an important part of our com-
munity response.
We stand united to support all members of the Uni-
versity community, in many different ways, seen and
unseen. As the University's elected Board of Regents
said so clearly at its Sept. 16 meeting, "When one mem-
ber of our community is targeted, we are all attacked."
E. Royster Harper is the vice president for
student affairs. Laura Blake Jones is the associate
vice president and dean of students.

Those who stay will redeem themselves

Nov. 27, 2011-
hose who stay will
Iredeem themselves.
Ryan Van Bergen
stayed.
While his teammates mobbed
Courtney Avery, whose intercep-
tion for the
Michigan
football team
sealed the
40-34 win
over Ohio
State on Sat-
urday, Van
Bergen slowly
walked to the TIM
sideline, his ROHAN
hands on his
head.
He flipped off his helmet, col-
lapsed on the blue bench and
wept.
The crowd's roar was deaf-
ening as Jake Ryan pulled Van
Bergen close, whispering in his
ear. Then Craig Roh did the same.
They told Van Bergen how much
his leadership meant, how much
of an impact he had on them.
The fifth-year senior had to
answer for why the defense was
so bad for three years. Now, he
could stand proudly and boast
about one of the best units in the
country.
"Michigan probably needed
this win to solidify what we've
done this season as a program,"
Van Bergen said after the game.
"This game is more than a win in
the win column. It's bigger than
that. It encompasses way more.
Our team feels like we finished
the season.... We went out the
way we wanted to go out.
"We put Team 132 in the books
forever. I think this team will
always be remembered as the
team that set a new standard and
re-established what Michigan
is supposed to be about. I'm just
glad I was a senior, being a part
of it."
Denard Robinson stayed.
When the game ended, he led
the sprint to the student section
to sing "The Victors." His 337
total yards and five touchdowns
will be a part of history, but Team

132 will remember how he willed
Michigan to finally beat the Buck-
eyes.
Brady Hoke finally found bal-
ance for Robinson ina "make-
shift" offense, one that fit the
quarterback who once thought of
transferring before Hoke arrived
in January.
Now, the quarterback who had
been beaten up - by his critics
and by Big Ten defenses - smiled
wider than ever.
"I'm justglad I'm playing with
these guys because I wouldn't
rather be (anywhere) else," Rob-
inson said.
"I'm glad I stayed."
Mike Martin stayed.
The team's best defensive play-
er on a few of Michigan's worst
defenses finally was a part of a
true Michigan defense.
Martin, Van Bergen and fifth-
year senior defensive tackle Will
Heininger stepped back from the
mob that started to rush the field.
"We just kind of stood out
there and soaked it in - what this
team had done," Martin said.
David Molk stayed.
He anchored the offensive line
Robinson turned to in the fourth
quarter when the Wolverines
needed to ice the game.
"We're going to ride you guys,"
Robinson told them. "You're
goingto win this for us."
Molk, the center with a mean
streak, became the lifeline of
Hoke's offense, protecting Rob-
inson and guiding a powerful run
game. The injuries that plagued
his career became an after-
thought.
When it was done, the usually
even-keeled Molk laughed the
loudest.
"It's been a longtime," Molk
said. "I've been through a lot of
stuff. But then again, in the end,
you truly realize what this place
means.
"I love Michigan, there's no
doubt about it. I don't care what
we had to go through. I love this
school. I love this university. I
love this team. I love my team-
mates. I love my coaches. This is
great. This is what college foot-

ball is. (I'll) never forget it."
Senior receivers Kevin Koger,
Junior Hemingway and Martavi-
ous Odoms all stayed, and they all
caught touchdown passes against
the Buckeyes.
Those who stayed were around
long enough to see Hoke's count-
down clocks be reset - on Sun-
day, one of them read "zero" days
since Michigan lastbeat "Ohio,"
the other read "364 days" until
the next edition of The Game.
Many seniors watched the
finale unfold from the sidelines,
their reward for staying being a
kiss on the cheek from Hoke and
a personalized Michigan football
from the pregame senior day fes-
tivities.
Still, those who stayed will
forever be known as Brady Hoke's
first team - Team 132, as he calls
them - immortalized just like Bo
Schembechler's first team in 1969.
When Schembechler told that
team, "Those who stay will be
champions," he didn't inherit the
110th-ranked defense. His quar-
terback wasn't an enigma.
We've learned that sometimes
those who stay will have to
endure. They will be ridiculed.
They will be embarrassed, play-
ing through the worst three
years in the history of Michigan
football. They will represent a
dark age, one unknown to anyone
before their time. They will be
considered the children of a pres-
tigious program that just don't
fit in.
If Team 132 has taught us any-
thing, it's that there won't always
be championships for those who
stay, but there will be glory.
Those who stay will knock
off Notre Dame under the lights
at Michigan Stadium. They'll
demolish Nebraska, welcoming
Big Red to the Big Ten the way
Michigan teams of old would.
And, above all, those who stay
will beat Ohio State, completing
their journey from forgettable to
legendary.
Those who stay will bring back
Michigan football.
They immediatelybought into
a magical coach and didn't look

back. Hoke taught them how to
play "Michigan football," when
they admittedly didn't know the
meaning of the phrase.
He made sure the Ohio State
game would be the most impor-
tant of their lives. Molk said The
Game was emphasized "a thou-
sand times" more than during the
three-year Rich Rodriguez era,
and they'll remember this win -
the one that ended Ohio State's
seven-year win streak - forever.
Those who stay will love Brady
Hoke and all he stands for. They'll
play for him because he loved
them first.
"He is us; we are him," Molk
said. "I love him. I love how he
coaches. I love his leadership
ability and how he does it. I'd do
anything for him.
"If I ever (come) back, 20 years
from now, the first guy I would
find, I would call coach Hoke.
That's who he is."
When the fans rushed the field,
the seniors who stayed thought,
"finally," as Van Bergen did, and
the win over Ohio State brought
them to tears. They drenched
Hoke in water, then hugged him.
One student in the stands
stayed. She held a sign that read:
"Brady, thanks for making our
senior year."
Eventually, Team 132 left the
Michigan family on the field and
gathered in the locker room. An
emotional Hoke told them how
he's "proud of them and what
they've done for Michigan."
"Just to see them happy, that's
the neat part," Hoke said. "I
mean, the investment and com-
mitment they've made as a team.
It's special. It's special. It's one of
those good days."
Those who stayed huddled
together one last time in the Big
House.
Van Bergen shouted, "Team
132 'til the death.
For having stayed, they got to
sing "The Victors." And it will
never again sound so sweet.

Men's gymnastics wins national title over Stanford, first since 2005

By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
April 16, 2010 - After four
hours of competition and six
rotations of events, the No. 3
Michigan men's gymnastics team
was leading the NCAA Cham-
pionship finals by .3 points over
Stanford.
And the Wolverines wouldn't
need much more than that on
Friday night, as the men's gym-
nastics team took home the
program's fourth national title
and Michigan's first team var-
sity national championship since

2005. In the process, the team
avenged last year's 1.3-point
championship loss to Stanford.
Leading the way for Michigan
was junior Chris Cameron. He
was selected as the Big Ten Gym-
nast of the Year two weeks ago
and won the all-around competi-
tion at Big Tens. So winning this
year's NCAA all-around victory
came as no surprise to spectators
in Christl Arena.
Cameron posted a total score
of 90.5, which was good enough
to upend the defending champ
from Oklahoma - Steve Legen-
dre - by 1.55 points. Senior Mel

Santander placed third in the all-
around with a score 88.90.
"I usually grasp everything
I've done right away," Cameron
said. "Not this. This hasn't hit me
yet. "
Michigan coach Kurt Golder
said afterward that he thought
the experience of coming up just
short last season helped the Wol-
verines.
"Finishing second last year
gave us a lot of incentive," Golder
said. "They had a team meeting
last year after the NCAA Cham-
pionships, and they made a com-
mitment to do everything in their
power to win it. It's just great for
all of us that it worked out."
In the team's losses this year,
the pommel horse and the fifth
rotation were weak spots for
Michigan. These routines were
plagued with mistakes and falls.
With a score of 58.85 on the pom-
mel horse and a meet-high 59.50
on the rings during the fifth rota-
tion, victory was almost assured
for the Wolverines.
Placing first on Thursday
allowed Michigan to choose
its starting event on Friday.
Knowing they would end on the

- allowed the Wolverines to
remain confident, despite trailing
Stanford the entire meet. Going
into the last event, Michigan was
down by 3.05 points. After scor-
ing a 62.70 on vault, they looked
sure to win.
But it wasn't over. Due to a
broken ring, anybody who fell
on their dismount on the rings
was given a second chance to
compete. Oklahoma was a full
three points behind Michigan
at this point, so the likelihood
of them catching up was slim to
none, even with two competitors
left. And as it turned out, junior
Thomas Kelley was able to com-
pete again, increasing Michigan's
score, and sealing the deal for the
national championship.
The top eight scorers in each
event Friday were crowned All-
Americans and went on to com-
pete for individual event titles on
Saturday. Redshirt senior Kent
Caldwell was named All-Amer-
ican on the floor exercise and
vault and redshirt senior Ryan
McCarthy won the only event
title for Michigan on high bar.
"I had to focus on making sure
that I was aggressive on my high

thing came into place after that.
I caught my release move, did a
good dismount, and a clean land-
ing."
Following McCarthy on the
high bar, junior Ian Makowske
placed second and Santander tied
for third. Santander and junior
Thomas Kelley placed second
and fifth on the parallel bars.
Cameron and McCarthy were
also All-American on the parallel
bars, tying for seventh.

As the Wolverines hoisted the
national championship trophy at
the conclusion of the meet, they
began to chant: "It's great to be a
Michigan Wolverine." The voices
resonated all through Christl
Arena as everybody watched.
"With our last national cham-
pionship that we won, when
we got back on Monday it was
the best day of work in my life,"
Golder said. "So unfortunately,

"To be honest, I was a little "Merrill's been big all year,"
scared," Hunwick said about Berenson said. "He's been as

... For him to step up in a game
like this and an event like this
and score the first two goals is
pretty special. He'll never forget
that."
Through the second and third
periods, Michigan doubled its
lead with a pair of power play
tallies from Hagelin - the Wol-
verines were 3-4 with the man-
advantage. At the 8:57 mark of
the third period, Rust corralled
a loose rebound in front of the
Michigan State net, spun away
from a defender and feathered
a pass backdoor to a wide open
Hagelin. The Swedish native
made no mistake about it, bang-
ing home the puck past an out-
stretch Palmisano.
Merrill, who generally plays
on the first-power play unit,
cited "keepingthings simple and
getting pucks to the net" as two
contributing factors for the Wol-
verines' success on the power
play against the Spartans.
Berenson added: "We work
on our power play probably as
much or more than most teams,
and we've had minimal results.
And tonight, it clicked. So I cant
tell you if it was any one thing,
but it clicked it. Especially that
first one, that was a good start
for us."
And at 8 p.m. on Saturday
night, the lights were finally
turned off inside Michigan Sta-
dium after The Big Chill at the
Big House. The show has now
come and gone, but the memo-
ry of such a historic event will
certainly linger in the minds of
everyone who was apart of the
spectacle. As Berenson said, "at
some point, we'll realize this
was really, really something."
"Whether you see it again, the
NHL continues to do it, we'll see
where it goes with these outdoor
games," he continued. "But you
can see as a participant there's
something special about them,
and this was another one."

Jan. 3, 2012 - Brady Hoke
leaned in, hugged Junior
Hemingway and gave him a kiss
on the forehead. Hemingway's
Most Outstanding Player Tro-
phy sat on the table in front of
him, and Hoke wore a smile as
he took his seat.
Earlier, Hemingway cried on
his mother's shoulder while cel-
ebrating Michigan's 23-20 over-
time victory in the Sugar Bowl
over No. 13 Virginia Tech. Hoke
always said he'd lead with his
seniors, and a fifth-year senior
had capped the coach's blessed
first season with a win.
"You've got to have guys who
can make those plays, and when
(Denard Robinson and Heming-
way) are the ones doing it, you
feel pretty good about it," said
Hoke, whose team became just
the fifth in modern Michigan
football history to win 11 games.
On a day Michigan amassed
just 184 yards of offense, it
wasn't Denard Robinson or
Fitzgerald Toussaint that
saved the day, it was "Big Play"
Hemingway, as Robinson calls
him. No one will be quick to call
Michigan's win pretty, but the
few plays Michigan did make
came at the most crucial of
times, when the game was in the
balance.
The first half had belonged
to Virginia Tech, but Michigan
held the lead. The second half
belonged to the Hokies too, but
Michigan had overtime. When
overtime came, Virginia Tech's
third-string kicker - who had
was a perfect 2-for-2 to that
point - missed a 37-yard field
goal. Michigan's Brendan Gib-
bons made his 37-yarder.
After the game, Hemingway
found his place on the stage at
the 20-yard line, maize and blue
confetti falling, right near where
he initially caught in his first
touchdown catch-and-run.
At that point, right was left.
Up was down. And, still, Junior
Hemingway was celebrating in
the end zone.
Call it magic. Call it luck. But
Robinson and Hemingway rou-
tinely made plays like this all
season. Robinson had thrown
a pick on just his second pass
attempt of the game, when he
lofted a ball toward Hemingway,
who had a one-on-one matchup.
Earlier this week, Robinson said
he wouldn't second-guess him-
self when he looked towards
Hemingway.
"We had a lot of confidence in
that combination," Hoke said.
With Virginia Tech romping
and the half winding down, Rob-
inson had Kyle Fuller, Virginia
Tech's best cornerback, reach-

After three early wins, Russell
squared off against Ohio State's
Hunter Stieber in the semifinals.
The Buckeye was Russell's only
loss in 72 matches over the last
two seasons.
Russell reflected on that match
more than once. He knew his
focus wasn't there. But this time,
it was.
Stieberstruck first after scram-
bling to keep a hold on Russell's
left leg. But in the second period,
Russell started in the down posi-
tion and scored an early escape.
That's when he started to open up
and rally a 5-2 win. With a lead,
he drove Stieber's head into the
mat, riding him out to advance to
the finals, where he would face
Iowa's Montell Marion.
In a press conference before
the 141-pound final, someone
asked Russell's opponent a telling
question.
"Montell, you've got one more

But there are no fairy tales in

planned. Though Russell posted

the first takedown, Marion retali-
ated and kept the score close.
Russell aggressively drove
Marion into the mat while
the Hawkeye tried to earn an
escape. But Marion tied it up in
the middle of the second period.
And after trading escapes, at the
sound of the whistle, Russell was
a single second away from a win
off of riding time. But 59 seconds
was not enough, and Marion took

Russell into sudden victory.
"He kind of caught me sleeping
a little bit when he got that take-
down," Russell said. "Going into
overtime, I knew I had the upper
hand."
Again, Russell came out on
top. He took control and brought
Marion down to the mat with 23
seconds left on the clock.
Though his first national title
was an accomplishment in and

of itself, his second-consecutive
crown was just icing on the cake.
Russell's last match as a Wol-
verine finalized his career record
at 134-12 to share the eighth
place on Michigan's all-time win-
ningest wrestlers list. 1
After the championships
ended, the Scottrade Center emp-
tied and the wrestlers parted
ways. But Russell left a two-time
national champion.

Arresting TV habits

N ow, the column about
a boy who lost his
favorite TV show, and
the one event that gave him no
choice but to keep it together -
it's "Arrested

end, but once
you utter that vile word, you
actually have to accept the fact
that it's all over - be it precious
time spent with a friend or a
significant chapter of your life
(one semester of college left
- taste the sadness). As I bid
farewell with my final column,
here's the story of my struggle
to let go of "Arrested Develop-
ment."
With the help of a Blockbust-
er within biking distance, I was
already on top of my cinematic
game in middle school. A "Fight
Club" here, a "Desperado" there
- I could recite Ezekiel 25:17
with every Sam Jackson inflec-
tion when seventh graders
should be thinking of Tarantino
as the guy who made frozen
pizza rolls.
But when it came to televi-
sion, my viewing habits were
stuck in a perpetual state of
adolescence. One could call it
arrested development. (Hey,
that's the name of the show!) I
still clung onto Chuckie Finster
and Arnold of football-shaped
cranium lore, filling the rest
of my airwaves with Dis-
ney Channel powerhouses
"Even Stevens," "Boy Meets
World" and "Smart Guy," and
when I was feeling especially
bold, the occasional episode of
"The Simpsons."
Because of a friend's recom-
mendation, I started watching
"Arrested Development" mid-
way through its first season on
air (who knew middle school-
ers had such good taste?). One
episode in, and I was hooked
like Buster Bluth's seal-assailed
hand.
Beyond its own virtues,
the show was my gateway
drug, stronger than anything
uncle-father Oscar ever toked.
"Arrested Development"
showed me the world of pri-
metime network television,
shining, shimmering, splendid.
It was the springboard for
"Scrubs," "24" and the rest of
the obscene number of shows
I've seen since.
FOX dropped the guillotine

season, banishing the final

Farah brothers'
latest film arrives
at the Michigan
By MATT EASTON
Daily Arts Writer
Oct. 24, 2011 - Last night was
not the premiere of "Answer
This!" but it felt like one. As film-
makers Chris and Mike Farah
walked onstage to the sound of
raucous applause, one couldn't
help but get caught up in the
moment. The Farah brothers
gave shout-outs to local high
schools, which were received
with loud screams, and the two
actors in the audience, Chris
Parnell ("30 Rock") and former
University Professor Ralph Wil-
liams, stood up to receive their
dues.
Sitting in Espresso Royale last
Monday, Chris and Mike were
much calmer: Scenes from their
first feature film "Answer This!"
were shot near here.
"Moving out to L.A.... it's just
nice to come back to Ann Arbor,"
said Mike, producer of "Answer
This!" and "Funny or Die," in an
interview with The Michigan
Daily. "It feels very comfortable,
it's a comfort zone. Just walking
here from the car, just the smell
of leaves on the ground."
In the past year or so, film-
makers have come to Ann Arbor
- and Michigan in general -
for tax breaks and Midwestern
scenes. But have any of them
known this place well enough
to express the intimate simplic-
ity of "leaves on the ground?"
To have movies like "The Ides of
March" filmed here is not quite
the same as to see a film that
understands what it means to
be in Ann Arbor. "Answer This!"
doesn't use unmarked buildings
in a generic Midwestern town,
but instead celebrates the Diag,
the Big House - the things stu-
dents hold dear. We love Clooney
and Gosling, but do they love us?
"I'd tried writing a bunch of
broad scripts," said Chris, the
"Answer This!" writer and direc-
tor, in an interview. "(But) they
weren't anchored in things I
knew or connected with. So I
decided that for my next script
(I wanted) to do something that
was really rooted in something
that meant a lot more to me."
Few things are more ingrained
in people than their hometown,
the place they grew up and the
place they went to college. But
"Answer This!" doesn't just cel-
ebrate the University - it also
seems to transform it.
"Something about movies, and
this movie particularly, has the
effect of making these places
that are so familiar look incred-

ibly big and epic," Chris said.
He motioned down State
Street to Ashley's, the center of
most action in the film, and dis-
cussed how the movie made this
simple piece of sidewalk seem
like so much more. The brothers
hope the entire film can allow
University students to see our
campus and our city from a new,
epic perspective.
The two also enjoyed giv-
ing some shout-outs to some, of
the "traditions" around cam-
pus. Laughing, Chris discussed
a sex scene that takes place in
the Hatcher Graduate Library
"stacks."
"It was fantastic to see how
people here responded differ-
ently than people in Hollywood,"
he said with a slight smirk.
The talk ended with Chris
recalling how sometimes, when
driving to their parents' house
in Ann Arbor, Mike used to say,
"Let's take it downtown," get-
ting off at an earlier exit - not
because it's faster, but just to take
it all in. The Big House, Main
Street, the leaves on the ground;
Ann Arbor, their town, our town.
For 90 minutes during yester-
day's screening event, hundreds
of individuals were transformed
into a community of friends cel-
ebrating the triumph of a city.

Every new Ann Arbor locale,
inside joke and recognizable
actor brought laughter, cheering,
applause and excited chattering.
It wasn't about seeing a movie,
it was about knowing that after-
wards you would walk down the
street and pass Ashley's, and you
would be standing where trivia
jock Izzy threw up. Or it was see-
ing the theater you were inside
of, in the movie, while watch-
ing the movie. It was a moment
for happiness, a giant raising
of glasses to our city, to simply
enjoying what we know best.
The movie showing was com-
plimented by unreleased "Funny
or Die" shorts (so in a way it was
a premiere), and a Q&A session
with the brothers and Parnell.
They drew laughter in their
setup to "Answer This!" After
the film the brothers and Par-
nell answered questions, any-
thing from "Why was Professor
Williams's name changed in the
movie?" to "What kind of advice
would you offer young comedic
actors?"
The three exited behind the
red curtain to cheering and
unanswered questions, inform-
ing everyone that they would be
going to Ashley's - the locus of
the trivia battles in the film - for
drinks and food.

Ten thoughts on 'Countdown'

Iknow this is awfully peri-
natal of me, but I've had
Beyonce's "Countdown"
on the brain for weeks. So, with
natural numbers, I'm running
down some
thoughts on
a song that
has been
stuck in my
head and
whispered
out of my lips
while antici- JOE

scrubbing
my back and
pacing the kitchen, waiting for
the kettle to hiss.
Ten years of courtship later
and six years after "Crazy
in Love," Beyonce has pro-
gressed, to nutty-bordering-
incoherent - devotional with
one riff and defiant with the
next - in a kaleidoscope of
atomic vocalese. "Countdown"
gives her the canvas for it - in
mixed media - a patch-worked
roller coaster through which
no dominant melody or mood
can pierce. From that opening
melismatic "boy," (transcribed
loosely as buoyee-eh-eeh-yee-
hee-yee-hee-ee-hee-ee-yee-
ee! and yes, you call us "girl,"
we'll call you "boy!") Beyonce
is transfiguring/deconstruct-
ing (grammar?), tearing up
the damn place. Rather than
pie-ee-eece out her syllables
mechanically like Katy Perry
or faux-tropically via Rihanna,
Beyonce's (occasionally over-
achieving - but here, wholly
earned) aerobics massage
