A 
federal 
district 
court 

dismissed a lawsuit filed by an 
former University of Michigan 
student 
who 
violated 
the 

University’s 
Student 
Sexual 

Misconduct 
Policy. 
A 
final 

opinion dated Jan. 5 declared the 
plaintiff’s claim of a due process 
violation was inaccurate.

According to court records, 

U.S. 
District 
Judge 
David 

Lawson upheld the reasoning 
behind the appeals board’s 
decision to expel the plaintiff 
because it did not violate his 
underlying due process.

The incident in question 

occurred at a fraternity house 

in January 2016 when the 
victim was a freshman at the 
University. According to the 
version of events presented in 
the case of the former male 
student, indentified as John Doe 
in the claim, the woman was 
served a shot of vodka in the his 
room upstairs after they met 
earlier. After the shot, the pair 
went back downstairs, danced 
and eventually started kissing 
before they went back his room. 
The two then allegedly had sex.

The 
male 
and 
female 

students’ lawsuits differ in 
their description of the event. 
Though the male’s suit said the 
woman had no problem dancing 
or talking, her lawsuit described 
a witness who said she later 

The University of Michigan’s 

plans to renovate the Michigan 
Union, which include creating 
easier access to the building 
for 
patrons 
with 
physical 

disabilities, have so far received 
overall positive feedback from 
students.

The 98-year-old Union — a 

haven of student offices, dining 
areas and large rooms for 
meetings, traditionally regarded 
as a centerpoint of campus — 
will be under construction as 
part of a large infrastructural 
renovation in the spring of 2018. 
An $85.2 million budget will 
go toward improving student 
study and lounge space in the 
building, as well as historical 
restoration.

The plan was approved by 

the Board of Regents on July 
21, 2016 at its monthly meeting, 
a vote which approved the 
building’s 
most 
extensive 

renovations since its opening. 
The budget for the project 
comes from the $65 University 
Unions and Recreational Sports 
Facility Improvement Fee that 
all full time students started 
paying in 2014.

Susan Pile, senior director of 

University Unions and Auxiliary 
Services, said as of now there is 
no intention of increasing this 
fee due to additional funding 
from the University.

“That fee is set by the Board 

of Regents,” Pile said. “There is 

also funding coming from some 
other University sources such 
as Parking and Transportation 
and others to help shoulder the 
cost of the renovations but all 
that funding, all those funding 
sources are set at this point.”

LSA freshman Cindy Chu 

said she does not have a problem 
with the fee as it stands but 
expressed concern for lower-
income students having to pay 
the fee.

“Relatively, $65 isn’t much 

so right now; I don’t see too 

much of an issue but if you’re 
one of those students struggling 
to make ends meet, then of 
course it’s more difficult to 
them,” Chu said. “I feel like 
some people should be exempt 
from (the fee) if they’re under 
financial strain.”

The largest issue with the 

Union right now, according to 
Pile, is the lack of comprehensive 
compliance with the Americans 
with Disabilities Act of 1990, 
which mandates that buildings 
not discriminate against people 

with disabilities and provide 
equal opportunities for access 
and travel through the building. 
Issues such as ramp access and 
elevators that reach all levels of 
the building are scheduled to be 
improved in the renovations.

Currently, the main levels 

and the mezzanine levels of 
the Union are not connected by 
one main passenger elevator, 
making 
travel 
between 

floors difficult for those with 

About 50 students gathered 

Tuesday night inside the Ford 
School of Public Policy, where 
they ate pizza and chatted as a 
part of the “Pizza and President 
Obama’s Farewell Address” watch 
party organized by the University 
of Michigan’s chapter of College 
Democrats.

Though students in attendance 

said they were disappointed by 
the outcome of the 2016 election, 
many pointed to the importance 
of continuing to band together 
as a party. Public Policy junior 
Rowan Conybeare, explained the 
importance of continuing to fight 
for progressive ideals, even though 
the election results did not occur 
as she had hoped.

“(I) 
worked 
on 
Hillary’s 

campaign so we obviously thought 
tonight would be a little bit more 
exciting,” Conybeare said prior 
to the speech. “But I think (in 
Obama’s speech tonight) that 
he will create this picture again 
of hope for the future, and just 
that even though we didn’t get 
the presidential outcome that we 
want, we can still fight and we can

BAMN member Keysha Wall addresses the Central Student Government at a meeting in the Union on Tuesday.

A resolution asking President 

Barack 
Obama 
to 
support 

undocumented 
students 
— 

brought to the table by BAMN, 
the national coalition to Defend 

Affirmative Action, Integration 
and 
Immigrant 
Rights 
and 

Fight for Equality By Any 
Means Necessary — passed at 
Central Student Government’s 
first meeting of the semester. 
The body voted 26-4 with 7 
abstaining.

Last December, CSG passed 

a similar resolution — authored 

by 
CSG 
President 
David 

Schafer, CSG Vice President 
Micah Griggs and Chief of 
Staff Noah Betman, all LSA 
seniors. The resolution was a 
joint-statement by members of 
CSG expressing solidarity for 
undocumented 
students 
and 

need for a continuation of the 
Deferred Action for Childhood 

Arrival program, which allows 
undocumented immigrants to 
“apply for temporary deferrals 
of deportations and (for) work 
permits.”

Currently, according to a 

New York Times article cited by 
Shafer in his resolution, about 
741,000 individuals protected

Companies in Ann Arbor 

looking to increase foot traffic 
and sales can now advertise in 
nearby locations, serving the 
local small business community 
and college students looking for 
discounts. 

Spade, a mobile application 

launched in early December, 
aims 
to 
help 
local 
small 

businesses advertise for one 
another.

Spade serves as the middleman 

between businesses looking to 
advertise and locations looking to 
profit, according to Kinesiology 
sophomore Jake Fleshner, the 
company’s co-founder and chief 
marketing officer.

Fleshner’s older brother came 

up with the idea three years 
ago and developed it for about 
a year before handing it off to 
Fleshner, who saw the app as an 
opportunity to create a network 
of businesses.

“We thought ‘Why is no one 

doing this yet?’ ” Fleshner said. 
“Why aren’t businesses helping 
each other, cross-remoting and 
helping the local small business

Students concerned by rumors of 
illness outbreak on, around campus

Public Affairs verifies gastrointestinal illness not confirmed as norovirus

ON THE DAILY: DEVOS’ CONFIRMATION HEARING DELAYED

Betsy DeVos, U.S. Department of Education Secretary nominee, will wait one more week until she can officially be 

confirmed to begin her responsibilities under president-elect Donald Trump’s new administration.

The Senate announced a delay of Devos’ 

confirmation hearing late Monday evening; 
though the original hearing was scheduled 
for Jan. 11, the Michigan native, education 
activist and philanthropist will now seek 
confirmation next Tuesday. 

The 
Senate 
Committee 
on 
Health 

Education Labor and Pensions (HELP) 
postponed the hearing due to Devos’ 
incomplete financial disclosures and an 
unfinished ethics review with pending 
conflicts 
of 
interest. 
Such 
potential 

conflicts include DeVos’s status as the 
chairman of Windquest Group Inc. and 
her family’s philanthropic fund, which has 
donated heavily to education causes.

Committee 
Chairman 
Sen. 
Lamar 

Alexander (R–Tenn.) and Ranking Member 
Sen. Patty Murray (D–Wash.) said in a joint 
statement the delay was “at the request of 
Senate leadership to accommodate Senate 
schedule.”

Since Monday, there has 

been 
ongoing 
speculation 

regarding a recent norovirus 
outbreak in certain dorms, 
dining halls and off-campus 
locations.

One student tweeted about 

the virus on Monday morning, 
expressing concern over a 
possible outbreak happening 
on campus.

Another tweeted about the 

virus early on Tuesday.

However, 
University 

spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald 

said 
he 
verified 
with 

University 
Health 
Service 

today that in the past two 
days just 14 students have 
come into the clinic with 

gastrointestinal 
illness, 

something he said is normal 
during the winter months.

“It’s not concentrated in 

any area at all,” Fitzgerald 
said. “They always ask where 
students live and they said 
they’ve 
been 
scattered 
on 

campus and off campus — no 
concentration 
that 
would 

indicate any sort of outbreak. 
They’ll continue to watch this 
closely, and working with 
keeping track through — again 
this is normal practice, but 
they’ve reached out to Housing 
and Health Department.”

Fitzgerald 
also 
said 

representatives at Michigan 
Medicine 
— 
formerly 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan 

Health System — have seen 
no uptick in normal number 
of gastrointestinal illness at 

the emergency department, 
further indicating the number 
is normal for gastrointestinal 
illness 
in 
the 
winter. 

Fitzgerald added it will take 
time to confirm this through 
lab 
tests 
and 
there 
have 

been no confirmed cases of 
norovirus at this point.

Students have also heard 

rumors of the norovirus at 
Chi Phi fraternity located on 
Washtenaw Avenue, though 
the 
Daily 
was 
unable 
to 

confirm this as of Tuesday 
evening.

The most recent outbreak 

of norovirus was in February 
2016, when speculation about 
the virus on campus began 
when approximately 75 to 
100 students were confirmed 
to be experiencing symptoms 
of 
vomiting 
and 
diarrhea, 

according to an email 
sent by the late Dr. Robert 
Winfield, then-executive 
director of UHS. These 
instances were confirmed 
later in the week by the 
Office of Public Affairs 
as confirmed cases of 
norovirus. The norovirus 
remained on campus until 
early March.

According 
to 
the 

Centers 
for 
Disease 

Control and Prevention, 
the 
most 
common 

symptoms 
of 
the 

norovirus 
include 

diarrhea, throwing up, 
nausea 
and 
stomach 

pain, along with fever, 
headaches 
and 
body 

aches. Symptoms usually 
develop 12 to 48 hours 
after exposure to the 
virus. 
The 
CDC 
also 

states norovirus is the 
leading cause of illness 
and 
outbreaks 
from 

contaminated food in the 
United States, many of 
which occur in the food 
service industry.

community? We thought they 
should be working for each 
other — making more revenue 
and getting more foot traffic.”

Spade 
takes 
print 

advertisements from clients — 
local restaurants, for example 
— and places them in local 
apartment buildings such as 
Zaragon or University Towers. 
Consumers can download the 
app and take a photo of the ad 
to unlock the discount.

Fleshner said a small town 

can benefit from a company like 
this because small businesses 
are aware of where other small 
businesses fit in the market. 

“We thought Ann Arbor was 

the perfect place,” Fleshner 
said. “Everyone knows what 
each other’s gist is and what 
people are trying to do.”

According to LSA junior Ben 

Kriegsman, Spade’s regional 
manager, Ann Arbor also serves 
as a good place to develop the 
company 
before 
hopefully 

establishing 
it 
in 
other 

locations such as New York or 
Los Angeles.

“The beauty of this for us is 

we get to have our idea explored 
in our college town,” he said. 
“We get to have consumers who 
are also our peers, who are also 
students, use our products, use 
the app and get benefits from 
it. That way, we can adjust our 
business model and adjust our 
ideas going forward based on 
how that works.” 

Fleshner said he believes 

students will enjoy the app as 
it is easily accessible on their 
phones and offers desirable 
discounts.

“Students — everyone wants 

discounts, 
everyone 
wants 

content,” he said. “We’re always 
looking for stuff and we’re 
always on our phones. Through 
this app, you’re going to be able 
to unlock discounts to places 
that are local. For students it’s 
going to be great to unlock stuff 
and it’s also going to be great 
to see what other people are 
unlocking.”

The app consists of a feed 

that allows people to see what 
their friends and other local 
people are unlocking. They 

can like and comment on these 
items.

Overall, the company has 

more than 150 app downloads, 
22 
partnerships 
between 

businesses and 12 businesses on 
board overall.

Over the winter holiday, 

the 
company 
worked 
to 

improve the app, specifically 
by 
incorporating 
beacon 

technology, which will allow 
advertisers and partners to 
connect virtually.

This new form of technology 

works by way of a small device 
that can pick up signals from 
app users and instantly send the 
advertisement to their mobile 
devices. That way, store-goers 
can have access to discounts 
instantaneously.

Business 
junior 
Jordan 

Golshan said she saw several 
Spade ads in the elevator of her 
apartment — one of which was 
for 25 to 50 percent off for the 
rest of the day at Bivouac, an 
outdoor gear and apparel store 
on State Street.

Golshan said she followed 

the directions posted nearby, 
downloaded the app, took a 
picture of the ad and then 
proceeded to buy something 
from Bivouac. Golshan said she 
was pleased with how user-
friendly the app was.

She also said the app is 

ideal for a city like Ann Arbor 
because it makes popular places 
affordable to college students.

“I think this is a great 

college-town 
app, 
because 

there is already a community 
of these local restaurants that 
you can frequent,” she said. 
“Because Spade is able to 
conveniently place these ads in 
places that people go a lot and 
offers discounts to the places 
that people go a lot, I think that 
combination is really beneficial 
to college students who are 
interested in saving money.”

Golshan said she thinks the 

app would benefit other college 
towns as well.

Meanwhile, Fleshner said he 

wants to encourage students to 
check out their local favorite 
businesses for discounts.

saw the woman “crying, naked, 
swaying a lot, with slurred 
speech, vomit in her hair, a 
flushed face, and unable to 
stand or walk on her own.”

Later 
in 
the 
evening, 

the 
female 
went 
to 
the 

hospital, where a rape kit 
was administered by medical 
personnel. 
No 
criminal 

charges were made against 
the male at the time, though 
it 
was 
investigated 
by 

the University’s Office or 
Institutional Equity. The OIE 
initially concluded the male 
in question did not violate 
the sexual misconduct policy 
in April 2016, though the 
decision was overturned by an 
appeals board in May 2016.

Following the decision, the 

student was expelled from the 
University. 

The 
suit 
against 
the 

University 
by 
the 
former 

male 
student 
was 
filed 

on Sept. 1. He said he was 
forced to sign a permanent 
separation agreement with 
the University on June 27 
based on an “improper and 
erroneous 
determination” 

by 
a 
University 
appeals 

board made up of two faculty 
members 
and 
a 
student. 

Lawson’s decision references 
a preponderance of evidence 
considered by the appeals 
board, including the plaintiff’s 
inconsistent accounts.

“Nothing about the panel’s 

rationale 
for 
discounting 

Doe’s testimony suggests that 
it did so because of his sex or 
gender,” the opinion reads. 
“As to Doe’s own testimony, as 
noted previously, the appeal 
panel found his account of the 
sexual encounter significantly 

less 
credible 
because 
of 

his abrupt reversal during 
his 
interview 
with 
police 

wherein he conceded that 
his account was ‘wrong’ and 
the complainant’s was ‘right,’ 
with the exception that he 
continued to insist that he 
never heard the complainant 
say ‘no sex.’ ”

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald said he was pleased 
the federal judge ruled in favor 
of the University’s process for 
handling sexual misconduct.

“We 
are 
gratified 
that 

the federal court affirmed 
the 
University’s 
sexual 

misconduct 
process,” 

Fitzgerald said.

The 
sexual 
misconduct 

policy was updated July 2016, 
adding changes to definitions 
of consent, sanctions and the 
appeals process. An appointed 
appeals board consisting of a 
faculty member, staff member 
and student was replaced with 
an expert external reviewer 
with legal knowledge.

Though the policy change 

was not in effect at the time 
of the case, Deborah Gordon, 
his lawyer, said her client 
would have not been expelled 
under the updated appeals 
process 
and 
definition 
of 

incapacitation in the new 
sexual misconduct policy.

“My client did have a fair 

hearing in front of the OIE 
investigator,” she said. “That 
was all swept away by this 
appeals 
panel. 
I’m 
really 

surprised by the lack of due 
process rights provided to 
students whose lives are going 
to be completely changed 
forever.”

Gordon 
applauded 
the 

updates, 
though, 
which 

Fitzgerald 
said 
were 
not 

instituted in relation to the 
case in question.

“Like so much of the policy, 

we 
spent 
several 
months 

looking 
at 
other 
schools’ 

policies, doing outreach in our 
community with open forums 
and meetings,” he said. “Most 
of the changes grew out of 
that process.”

In 
response 
to 
Doe’s 

lawsuit, the female victim — 
identified as Jane Doe — filed 
a suit of her own in Washtenaw 
County Circuit Court on Sept. 
21, in which she claimed 
battery and assault stemming 
from 
the 
alleged 
sexual 

assault, as well as a breach 
of contract over the male’s 
decision to seek readmission 
to the University following 
his agreement to permanently 
withdraw. Jennifer Salvatore, 
the female student’s lawyer, 
welcomed the federal court’s 
decision.

“It has been very difficult 

for 
my 
client 
to 
come 

forward and go through the 
university’s 
process,” 
she 

wrote in an email interview. 
“Then with the respondent 
suing and attempting to get 
back into the university after 
he agreed to withdraw — it 
injected a lot of uncertainty 
into 
her 
life 
and 
her 

educational experience. She is 
relieved that his case has been 
dismissed and is grateful for 
the court’s swift decision.”

disabilities.

Pile 
also 
mentioned 
the 

handicapped 
ramp 
on 
the 

north end of the building 
needs renovation. After the 
construction, Pile said, the 
building will be much more 
accessible for all patrons.

“One 
of 
our 
challenges 

with a building that’s going 
to be 100 years old in 2019 
is that it was built in a time 
that really didn’t need to take 
(physical 
disabilities) 
into 

consideration,” Pile said. “And 
that’s a commitment that we 
have today, to ensure that 
we’re going to be able to better 
address those needs and make a 
more inclusive community.”

Engineering freshman James 

Surge said the direct passenger 

elevators will contribute to the 
Union’s plan of inclusion for 
everyone.

“I approve of that,” he said. 

“It makes it easier for everyone 
to get around. If there’s one 
elevator that goes to all the 
floors, then everybody has 
equal access to the space.”

LSA 
freshman 
Alexandra 

Niforos said the fact that the 
improvements to handicapped 
resources haven’t been a larger 
issue earlier is concerning but 
the renovations are better late 
than never.

“I don’t know why we don’t 

have elevators right now that go 
all the way up to all the floors,” 
Niforos said. “But anyways, it’s 
good that they’re doing this.”

One of the largest spaces 

slated for renovation is the 
courtyard in the middle of 
the Union. According to Pile, 
the outdoor courtyard behind 
Starbucks will be covered and 

converted into a larger study 
space for students.

Niforos said the plan to 

build the ceiling over the 
courtyard closes off the Union’s 
connection to fresh air in the 
warmer months.

“I 
think 
it’s 
cute, 
the 

courtyard,” Niforos said. “I 
mean I’ve never been into it 
but I feel like we have enough 
rooms in this place that we can 
have one outdoor space.”

As of right now, Pile said 

there are no further plans 
for 
renovations 
after 
the 

$85 
million 
is 
exhausted. 

Furthermore, she said as much 
will be done with the budget as 
possible.

“This isn’t a phased project,” 

Pile said. “This isn’t phase 
one of more to come. We’re 
spending the budget that we 
have and moving forward with 
that.”

under DACA in the United 
State.

BAMN returned to CSG 

to propose a resolution that 
would urge Obama to use 
his executive power to stand 
against President-elect Donald 
Trump’s 
future 
intentions 

to overturn DACA, an act 
that 
allows 
undocumented 

immigrants who were brought 
to the United States by their 
parents as minors to defer 
deportation. The resolution 
asked CSG to directly send 
a statement to the White 
House expressing support for 
students under DACA.

University of Michigan alum 

Kate Stenvig acknowledged 
the past resolution, hoping to 
now directly talk to the White 
House instead of merely the 
previous general statement of 
solidarity.

“The reason that we want 

you to take it a step further 
to 
specifically 
ask 
Obama 

to do this action is this is a 
real concrete thing that can 
be done, that can be a real 
victory against the threat of 
deportation,” she said. “If 
Obama does nothing to protect 
those people, the people who 
have DACA and the people 
who applied for DACA would 
be in a worse position than 
before 
they 
applied. 
That 

would be a real betrayal, and I 

think it would show the huge 
bankruptcy of principal in our 
whole political system.”

The 
new 
resolution, 

authored by CSG members who 
are also involved with BAMN, 
cites several problems left by 
the Obama administration.

“Applying 
for 
DACA 

required 
giving 
the 

government extensive personal 
and 
familial 
information, 

including 
school 
records, 

addresses, fingerprints and 
a DNA sample,” it stated. 
“DACA applicants relied on 
the 
promises 
of 
President 

Obama and his administration 
that the data they provided 
would never be used against 
them or their families, and 
took this risk in order to 
advance their own futures as 
well as their families and their 
communities.”

LSA senior Keysha Walls 

said protecting documented 
students 
was 
Obama’s 

obligation, since he was elected 
with the promise of protecting 
them. The resolution’s authors 
believed Obama failed to take 
appropriate 
action 
toward 

immigration 
rights 
during 

his final days of presidency, 
pointing to this as evidence 
of abandoning those under 
DACA.

Walls 
noted 
applying 

to DACA was a large risk 
for 
undocumented 
youth 

as 
it 
required 
personal 

information, including DNA 
samples, that could be used 
to identify and deport them. 

According to BAMN, this data 
should be protected through 
executive action because of 
his 
administration’s 
moral 

obligation 
to 
continue 

protecting immigrant youth.

“The 
safety 
of 
these 

undocumented 
immigrants 

is only promised under the 
Obama 
administration,” 

Walls said. “For Obama to 
know these things, and not 
take every cautionable step to 
ensure the continued safety 
of undocumented peoples in 
this nation is disgusting and 
inhumane … If he will not 
act on his own, then we must 
take action, in doing so set the 
example for him.”

Trump’s campaign has been 

controversial 
— 
especially 

in regards to immigration. 
Trump 
has 
promised 
to 

build a wall on the United 
States’ 
southern 
border, 

and claimed Mexico would 
pay for it — though recently 
Trump has asked Congress 
to do so instead. Trump has 
discussed a “Muslim ban,” and 
has suggested stopping those 
who practice the religion or 
come from Muslim-dominate 
countries from entering the 
United States.

CSG had a heated debate over 

whether to keep the political 
aspects 
of 
the 
resolution. 

Schafer asked the authors to 
remove references to Trump in 
order to keep CSG politically 
unbiased. This decision was 
contentious among the body, 
as a few members felt that the 

resolution should hold Trump 
to official statements he has 
made during his campaign and 
the impending prospects of his 
presidency.

“Understanding the ability 

and the responsibilities of 
this 
organization, 
I 
don’t 

feel 
comfortable 
the 
way 

in which it’s worded,” he 
said, explaining CSG should 
support students across the 
political spectrum.

Despite the debate, Schafer’s 

suggestion was included in the 
draft. Ultimately, with several 
modifications 
eliminating 

all mentions of Trump, the 
resolution passed.

Engineering 
senior 
Alex 

Brewster 
commended 

Schafer’s 
amendment, 

stating he feels University 
students 
could 
still 
show 

their support for immigrants 
without pointing fingers and 
implicating certain figures.

“As an immigrant myself, 

I think it’s really important 
to stress immigrants rights, 
but on the other hand, I think 
one thing that, even though 
I did vote for the resolution, 
I didn’t enjoy was that we 
were playing the blame game, 
and I do appreciate David for 
taking the names out,” he 
said. “I think the resolution 
that we passed still hammers 
home 
that 
University 
of 

Michigan students still care 
about immigrants … whether 
they 
are 
documented 
or 

undocumented, 
we 
accept 

them as human beings.”

still band together.”

Also prior to the start of the 

speech, LSA junior Ellen Endres 
echoed this statement, expressing 
her belief that Obama would 
deliver a strong farewell address.

“I really expect him to give the 

speech with the same amount 
of grace and intelligence that 
he’s carried out throughout his 
campaign,” Endres said. “I’m 
really not expecting anything less 
tonight.”

As President Barack Obama 

took the stage at McCormick Place 
in Chicago and began his speech, 
murmurs of “this is the last one” 
echoed throughout the room and 
faded into silence. Some students 
in the auditorium pulled out 
tissues to wipe away tears.

Obama framed most his address 

around urging his listeners to 
respect all American citizens, 
and fighting against the political 
division caused by issues such as 
terrorism, economic crisis and 
race relations. He said Americans 
must respect one another as equals 
and work to empathize with 
the immigrants coming into the 
country.

“So regardless of the station 

that we occupy, we all have to try 
harder,” Obama said. “We all have 
to start with the premise that each 
of our fellow citizens loves this 
country just as much as we do, that 
they value hard work and family 
just like we do. That their children 

are just as curious and hopeful and 
worthy of love as our own.”

The president also encouraged 

Americans to not be complacent 
and to exercise their full rights as 
citizens in a democracy.

“So you see, that’s what our 

democracy 
demands,” 
Obama 

said. “It needs you. Not just when 
there’s an election, not just when 
your own narrow interest is at 
stake, but over the full span of a 
lifetime. If you’re tired of arguing 
with strangers on the Internet, try 
talking with one of them in real 
life. If something needs fixing, 
then lace up your shoes and do 
some organizing.”

LSA junior Collin Kelly, College 

Democrats chair, said he thinks 
all of Obama’s speeches have been 
remarkable, including his farewell 
address. He explained he was sad 
to see his long-time role model 
leave office, but said he found 
Obama’s words both empowering 
and inspiring.

“He has a sense of optimism 

about the country that’s inspiring 
and that’s really all we can say 
about it because he makes us want 
to keep working hard to fight for 
the values that we believe in and 
that definitely accomplished it,” 
Kelly said. “It was bittersweet for 
sure to see someone that we all 
grew up with as our president, 
someone that we all adore and 
look up to as a role model, it’s sad 
to see him go in his final speech as 
president, but he left us with words 
to continue living and fighting by.”

WATCH PARTY
From Page 1A


I

n one of my classes, we 
had an opportunity to talk 
candidly 
about 
grades. 

One 
student 
humored 
the 

crowd: “The smarter 
you get, the worse 
grades you get!” He 
received 
a 
laugh 

from his audience, 
including me. It was 
a typical “talent” vs. 
“striver” debate.

Initially, I found 

some comfort in my 
classmate’s statement 
— it was a tempting 
way to justify the bad 
grades I have received. However, 
the utterance carried a belittling 
tone 
toward 
the 
“strivers,” 

which I found offensive. If you 
try to get good grades, are you 
not a true intellectual?

Researchers 
at 
Vanderbilt 

University have found that gifted 
people are more likely to hold 
top positions in all professional 
domains. On the other hand, 
Angela Duckworth, a professor 
of psychology at the University 
of Pennsylvania, finds that it is 
perseverance and passion for 
long-term goals — grit — that 
leads us to achievement. “Talent 
doesn’t make you gritty,” she 
corroborates the old adage that 
hard work does pay off.

According to Professor Chia-

Jung 
Tsay 
from 
University 

College 
London, 
however, 

it is human nature to prefer 
“talents,” or “naturals,” over 
“strivers.” His research shows 
that 
employers 
innately 

prefer the potential in those 
who are naturally talented to 
those who have demonstrated 
achievements 
with 
effort. 

The popularity of the college-
dropout-turned-mogul success 
story — think Bill Gates, Steve 
Jobs, etc. — illustrates the 
idolization 
of 
“naturals.” 
A 

friend once told me, “I wish I 
didn’t have to go to college so 
I can get rich quick.” Rather 
than small rewarding steps, 

we, as millennials, have come 
to only acknowledge success by 
glorifying the final product.

At a prestigious university 

like ours, there is 
a 
large 
sense 
of 

pre-professional 
culture created by 
competitive groups of 
students. Seemingly, 
there are three types: 
1) a 4.0 GPA student 
with an obsession 
over perfection, 2) 
a 3.8 GPA student 
working 
on 
an 

honors thesis and 

3) a 3.5 GPA student with an 
appetizing resume. However, 
I was a fourth type: a student 
with a fine GPA but with no 
career title attached to my 
introduction. I did not identify 
myself as “pre-med” or “pre-
law.” Perhaps I felt confined by 
this sense of identification that 
I don’t feel the need to perfect 
my GPA.

Reality 
hit 
me 
when 
I 

met with a professor at the 
University Medical School to 
ask for a research position. 
Her office had a scholarly aura 
with loose papers draped over 
her desk. “You need better 
grades,” she instructed me. “A 
bad grade can haunt you for a 
lifetime.” Her dissatisfaction 
with the 0.1-point difference 
in my GPA to her expectation 
of excellence felt massive. I 
had predicted her response, 
but rejection is always a head-
spinning experience.

Grades were not unimportant 

to me, but I found myself giving 
more importance to things 
outside of school: I chose 
to attend my friend’s mom’s 
funeral instead of preparing 
for an exam. I chose to spend 
my 
study 
nights 
providing 

company for my stressed father. 
And I chose to spend my last 
summer as a travel guide for my 
grandma’s first and last visit 
from Korea instead of getting 

an internship. Was I sacrificing 
my grades for the wrong things?

I held back my tears and 

soldiered 
forward 
with 
my 

integrity. 
After 
an 
hour 
of 

conversation, her push about 
good grades diminished. Instead, 
she 
emphasized 
building 

character and her appreciation 
of my own. “You remind me of 
my best student who now studies 
at Harvard Medical School,” she 
said. “Pursue what makes you 
happy and have fun.” This was an 
important puzzle piece for me.

I began to pick out courses 

that truly interested me, which 
were less lecture-based biological 
science 
courses 
and 
more 

discussion-based 
neuroscience 

and social justice seminars. The 
following semesters, I prioritized 
learning as a student and gave 
my best effort to be a present 
daughter to my parents and an 
exciting friend to others.

As a result, I became smarter, 

with better grades. I realized 
that 
emerging 
interest 
and 

effort produced the best work.

The professor’s message to me 

rings every day like a morning 
alarm. The message was not to 
simply get perfect grades, but to 
use them to show that you are 
responsible and to reflect your 
character as a motivated person.

Considering 
what 
my 

classmate had said in class, I 
find that sometimes we are so 
focused on the end results that 
we undermine the hard and 
grueling effort it takes in the 
process. Barbara Corcoran, a 
real estate mogul, reminds us, 
“I imagined every great thing 
that happened in my life. Then 
I worked like hell to make every 
detail come true.”

Stand on two feet. Focus on the 

person that you want to become 
and the characteristics that you 
want to build. Perhaps as a side 
effect, you can get smarter, too.

“Y

ou’re on Trump’s 
side,” 
a 
tall 

mother, 
hair 

pulled out the back of her 
baseball 
hat, 
told 

her young, bikini-
clad daughter. While 
we all waited in line 
for ice cream at the 
beach, the daughter 
asked 
her 
mother 

about the recent U.S. 
statements on the 
Israeli 
settlements. 

The 
settlements 

had 
become 
the 

focus 
of 
renewed 

public 
scrutiny 
after 
their 

condemnation 
in 
a 
United 

Nations resolution and a speech 
by Secretary of State John Kerry 
— and President-elect Donald 
Trump’s tweeted condemnation 
of those condemnations — in late 
December 2016.

I was impressed that the 

daughter — who looked like she 
was only in middle school — 
wanted to talk about the Israeli 
settlements at the beach. But 
the mother’s response struck 
me as well. Rather than attempt 
to describe the controversial 
and endlessly complex situation 
in Israel to her daughter, the 
mother simply told her which 
side to support. 

But 
in 
many 
ways, 
the 

mother’s 
response 
reflects 

media coverage not only of the 
Israeli settlements issue, but of 
all issues. Instead of describing 
and explaining issues, policies 
and events, the news media 
simply 
relays 
information 

about who is on each side of the 
issue and what they are saying 
about 
it. 
Political 
parties 

function similarly, providing 
ample information on which 
policies, 
ballot 
initiatives 

and non-partisan candidates, 
like judges, party adherents 
should support.

This is reflected in public 

knowledge 
of 
politics 
and 

current 
affairs. 
While 
the 

majority of respondents to 
a Pew survey conducted in 
2012 could correctly identify 
all major policy positions of 
the Republican or Democratic 
parties, 
barely 
half 
could 

determine the correct partisan 
composition of the Senate, 
even when shown a picture 
of the Senate. Only a third of 
respondents knew how many 
Supreme Court justices were 
men and how many were 
women. Roughly a third knew 
who the chief justice of the 
Supreme Court is; whereas in 
1986, about 43 percent did.

Understanding 
who 
is 

making policy is central to 
understanding that policy, but 
those details are often left out 
of media reports. The processes 
that produced those policies and 

how those policies actually work 
gets similarly little attention in 
the popular press.

Yet 
a 
strong 
public 

understanding 
of 

policy is critical to 
sound 
democratic 

governance. 
When 

constituents 
lack 

information 
about 

the economic, social 
and national security 
implications of policy, 
politicians and spin-
doctors are free to 
scapegoat the other 
party and its policies 

and win elections by promising 
policies with little potential to 
achieve their purported goals. 
When 
voters 
expect 
their 

leaders to explain how a policy 
works, rather than just tell 
them to support it, it becomes 
infinitely harder to prop up bad 
policy with partisan rhetoric.

We live in a tell, don’t show 

media landscape when a well-
functioning democratic society 
requires the exact opposite.

This 
trend 
is 
new 
and 

reversible. At the height of the 
Great 
Depression, 
Franklin 

D. Roosevelt pioneered the 
use of radio to explain policy 
developments 
to 
American 

citizens. 
FDR 
used 
radio 

to 
explain 
the 
economics 

of his policies designed to 
prevent banking panics and 
stem the financial crisis. He 
briefed average Americans on 
economic processes taught in 
college classrooms.

To 
be 
sure, 
the 
media 

landscape 
has 
changed 

since the Great Depression. 
Consumers have a broader 
range of news sources of varying 
quality. The vast quantity of 
available information makes it 
increasingly difficult for media 
leaders and political innovators 
to capture and sustain public 
attention. Experts at Harvard 
University predict that, going 
forward, success in media will 
go to the organizations that 
pioneer ways to best capture 
the attention of their audiences.

Explanations 
of 
the 

economics 
and 
political 

processes that undergird policy 
do not lend themselves well to 
the kind of Twitter outrage and 
meme cycle that candidates 
took advantage of in the last 
election. 
But 
that 
doesn’t 

mean 
that 
current 
news 

industry frontrunners can’t 
work to regain public trust 
and establish a new standard 
for quality political reporting 
by 
consistently 
publishing 

articles that explain rather 
than assert.

Some 
publications 
do 

this already. Nate Silver’s 
FiveThirtyEight blog explains 
the 
statistics 
supporting 

politics and sports for a lay 
audience. The Economist and 
the Financial Times tend to 
incorporate 
more 
analysis 

into their articles. However, 
none of these sources inform 
large swaths of the American 
electorate 
or 
command 

large enough lay audiences 
to change the standards for 
reporting writ large. That 
requires editorial changes at 
publications such as The Wall 
Street Journal and The New 
York Times.

It’s tempting to take the 

problems 
with 
American 

news 
organizations 
as 
an 

indictment of their quality 
and relevance in the digital 
age. These organizations face 
pressure to adapt by adopting 
the language, style, tone and 
content of the blogosphere to 
transform serious content into 
clickbait that will stand out on 
Facebook and Twitter feeds.

Others 
condemn 
media 

professionals as biased insiders 
who 
intentionally 
mislead 

their audiences. In a media 
environment 
that 
rewards 

speed — often at the expense 
of analysis and accuracy —
mistakes are all but destined to 
occur and personal biases are 
likely to emerge. This holds true 
for professional reporters and 
the Twitter commentariat alike.

Professional 
journalists 

governed by strict professional 
standards 
have 
proven 

themselves 
more 
adept 
in 

producing 
quality, 
accurate 

content in the face of these 
pressures 
than 
anonymous 

amateur bloggers and those 
working for media organizations 
whose business model revolves 
around creating content that its 
audience will agree with.

Professional journalism has 

the greatest potential to solve 
the problem of tell, don’t show. 
Doing so seems likely to address 
the problem of perceived media 
bias as well — showing readers 
how the facts of a situation 
interact to support a given 
conclusion seems more likely to 
engender neutral storytelling 
than 
reporting 
where 

journalists and experts simply 
tell readers what they ought to 
take away from the story.

Sound good? Then one of the 

best ways to make this happen 
is to embrace organizations 
and reporters that embrace 
this 
model. 
Reading 
and 

supporting 
explanatory 

journalism 
increases 
the 

likelihood that publications 
will expand their use of, and 
other organizations will adopt, 
this kind of storytelling.

Don’t ignore your entitlement

ALEXIS MEGDANOFF | COLUMN

E

very year, almost all the 
top students from my 
high school attend the 

University of Michigan, and I 
am no different. I had 
always been a student 
who excelled at my 
work, so naturally I 
knew I would go to 
this fantastic school 
with the rest of my 
equally 
excelling 

peers. Together we 
would be the best of 
the best. Because of 
this, I thought I would 
handle any challenges 
I may face with ease just as I had 
done previously.

My logic was simple, but 

extremely skewed: I was a top 
student in high school, so of 
course I would be a top student 
here because that is who I was. 
It took me a while to realize how 
wrong this mindset was, and 
when the work started building 
up, I pacified myself by thinking 
everything would work itself out 
just as it had before.

Where did I get this idea? 

Why did I believe I would 
maintain the honors standing I 
had in high school while finding 
leadership positions in student 
organizations, making a whole 
new set of friends and learning 
how to manage life on my own 
simply because I thought this was 
who I am as a person? Where did 
this entitlement come from?

One of the most popular 

criticisms of millennials is our 
sense of entitlement. We think we 
deserve recognition constantly, 
even demand it of employers, 
while never expecting to stay 
in a job position for more than 
a few years. Whether it is true 
from individual to individual or 
not, we all must become aware 
of any amount of entitlement 
we maintain and do our best to 
remove it from our personalities. 

Entitlement only makes it more 
difficult to work together, find 
happiness and reach our goals.

According to Neil Blumenthal, 

co-founder 
and 

co-CEO 
of 
Warby 

Parker, “Entitlement 
is the root of all 
evil 
within 
an 

organization.” 
This 
type 
of 

attitude 
degrades 

collaboration among 
co-workers, as shown 
by one psychological 
study, which found 
an increased sense 

of entitlement leads to increased 
aggression after an individual 
receives criticism. The inability 
to handle feedback from others 
makes it difficult for teams 
to function efficiently in any 
situation.

But the negative effects go 

further than the workplace. The 
truth is entitlement is disastrous 
not 
only 
for 
workplace 

community but also for personal 
happiness — the same study also 
found that higher entitlement is 
more likely to lead to a person’s 
emotional instability.

In a recent interview with 

Tom Bilyeu on the talk show 
Inside Quest, The New York 
Times 
bestselling 
author 

Simon 
Sinek 
discussed 

millennials in the workplace. 
While comparing the journey 
to affecting the world to a 
journey to the summit of a 
mountain, he said, “What this 
young generation needs to 
learn is patience. That some 
things that really, really matter, 
like love or job fulfillment, joy, 
love of life, self-confidence, a 
skill set — any of these things 
— all of these things take time. 
Sometimes you can expedite 
pieces of it, but the overall 
journey is arduous and long 
and difficult, and if you don’t 

ask for help … you will fall off 
the mountain.”

Our entitlement is preventing 

us 
from 
maintaining 
the 

patience needed to take lesser 
opportunities to make it to 
the ultimate goal. When we 
act entitled, we are unable to 
see the slow journey toward 
success, and if we try to forget 
about this timely process, we 
are never going to fulfill our 
dreams. We want change, and 
that is admirable, but change is 
not always sudden. The gradual 
advancement of society takes a 
long time and we need to admit 
that one generation cannot do it 
all before we hit 40.

Entitlement taken at face 

value 
is 
naturally 
viewed 

as 
negative. 
Someone 
who 

believes they deserve a raise, 
a promotion or a bonus simply 
for doing a mediocre job is 
bound to be disliked. Yet, Forbes 
came out with an article this 
past September that claimed 
millennials are punished for 
being anything but entitled. 
There are also many studies 
that 
show 
entitlement 
is 

not 
always 
negative. 
The 

confidence entitlement gives 
to individuals leads many to 
believe it is permissible.

Despite all of this, entitlement 

still damages relationships and 
discourages teamwork. If we 
have one group of people who are 
unable to work together and form 
meaningful relationships, they 
will be incapable of successfully 
working with the rest of society 
for the greater good. So rather 
than accepting our entitlement 
as fact, we need to begin taking 
responsibility for the results of 
our actions and stop ignoring 
the long journey of life ahead 
of us.

‘Portlandia’ fails to match 
past seasons’ offerings

While latest season delivers on signature humor, a dependence on 
guests takes away from potential success and originality

‘La La Land’ and ‘Swing Time’ have a penchant for 

dreaminess and nostalgia that brings love for art to life

Following its fifth season, 

“Portlandia” was renewed for 
not one but two new seasons. 
IFC can’t get enough of Fred 
Armisen (“SNL”) and Carrie 
Brownstein (“Transparent”), 
the 
dynamic 
duo 
and 

co-creators/
stars 
of 
the 

sketch 
series. 

And neither can 
audiences. 
The 

show’s 
quirky 

comedy 
lives 

on the edge of 
the 
primarily 

parodic 
sketch 

humor 
it 

employs, 
with 

characters 
and 

scenes 
ranging 

from 
affably 

satirical 
to 
grotesquely 

bizarre.

Yet after seven seasons, it’s 

become clear that Armisen and 
Brownstein have no shortage 
of crazy comedy to dole out 
within a structure that serves 
boundlessly as a vessel for 
their original content. Their 
sketches 
turn 
themselves 

and their audiences on their 
heads, 
employing 
every 

sharp tool of wit and over-
the-top 
performance 
to 

push the boundaries of their 
fictionalized 
version 
of 

Portland, Ore. 

While 
the 
miscellany 

of content and apt parody 
typically work to the benefit 
of the show’s inexhaustible 
writing and humor, the season 
premiere suffered under the 
lack of a cohesive tone. As 
we’re shuffled from scene 
to scene, one sketch swells 
from subtle, acute humor to 
slapstick visual comedy and 
subsequent 
disappointment 

for both its fictional characters 
and the audience at home.

Perhaps this last sketch 

is designed self-reflexively, 
poking fun at the difficulty 
of engrossing storytelling. In 
it, Armisen and Brownstein 
play a couple desperate to 
dazzle dinner guests with an 

impressive 
anecdote. 
After 

hearing their friends recount 
how Tom Hanks pretended 
to mug them in Venice, the 
couple 
goes 
to 
extreme 

lengths, soliciting the help 
of a performing arts teacher 
(Claire Danes, “Homeland”) 
to instruct them in the art of 
dramatic storytelling.

However, the result of their 

efforts is less art and more 

artifice. 
The 

couple 
shocks 

their 
guests 

with a dramatic 
retelling 
(drum 

beating 
and 

vibraslap ringing 
included) of what 
is likely the most 
anticlimactic 
story ever told, 
bringing 
the 

sketch’s 
short 

life to an equally 
unsatisfying 

end. Though it’s clear what 
the sketch is getting at, its 
predictable (albeit kind of 
funny) arc falls flat.

Another sketch that fails 

to fulfill its comedic promise, 
despite its amusing pretense, 
is Armisen and Brownstein’s 
depiction 
of 
a 
couple 
of 

another kind: the goth Vince 
and Jacqueline. As they flip 
back 
and 
forth 
between 

deceptively dark personas and 
Bed, Bath & Beyond-loving 
stock characters — sometimes 
abruptly though often too 
subtly — the two meander 
through what ultimately turns 
out to be a half-baked sketch. 
At each turn, it falls short of 
its promise to be funny. The 
Bed, Bath & Beyond employee, 
seems as unfazed by the 
characters’ bizarre behavior 
as we’re expected to feel, 
but the discrepancy between 
reality 
versus 
expectation 

just doesn’t achieve the full 
comedic impact the sketch is 
designed to accomplish.

In an even more pointless 

one-part sketch – a commercial 
selling children’s toys made 
out of “100 percent organic” 
men’s beards to expose them 
to germs early on – the strange 
humor falls short of making its 
point or making us laugh. It’s 

sly and it’s snarky, like much 
of “Portlandia” ’s best, but it’s 
a little too on-the-nose.

However, the series still 

benefits 
from 
the 
aid 
of 

returning 
guest 
stars 
like 

Natasha Lyonne (“Orange Is 
The New Black”) and Vanessa 
Bayer (“Saturday Night Live”), 
who help bring the show’s 
unconventional 
characters 

and scenarios to life with 
convincing dynamism.

After Bayer, playing a tired 

traveler, arrives at her hotel, 
she is met by the the bell boy 
(Armisen), who relentlessly 
explains the use and and 
function of every single hotel 
room item, from the light 
switches to the bathrobes. 
He 
even 
embellishes 
his 

demonstrations 
with 
little 

theatrical bits, much to the 
weary guest’s vexation. The 
simple play on conventional 
hotel 
check-in 
experiences 

taken to the extreme is a prime 
example of one of the show’s 
better 
executed 
sketches. 

The premise sets a perfect 
background 
against 
which 

Armisen 
demonstrates 
his 

idiosyncratic humor and Bayer 
plays the great sport that goes 
along with it all (that is, until 
she flings herself out her hotel 
window only to be caught by 
Armisen, who she’s trying to 
escape form in the first place).

Though the series premiere 

isn’t a shining example of 
Armisen’s 
and 
Brownstein’s 

distinct talents, it nonetheless 
delivers a compelling enough 
sequence 
of 
sketches 
that 

convey their keen awareness of 
the ingrained and unfortunate 
circumstances of our society. 
While 
not 
laugh-out-loud 

hilarious, it still entertains. 
I’m 
not 
convinced 
though 

that the comedic duo is by any 
means settling. The best part 
of “Portlandia” is that we never 
know what to expect, and that’s 
precisely the quality that a show 
nearing its end must hold on to 
if it’s to make a charming and 
memorable exit. Luckily, we 
have a full season to look ahead 
to and Armisen and Brownstein 
aren’t going anywhere anytime 
soon — except to Bed, Bath & 
Beyond, that is.

All Things Reconsidered:
Looking back on ‘FWN’

As we enter 2017, it seems 

only fitting to look back on 
some 
of 
the 
most 
pivotal 

albums from the year 2007, 
now shockingly a decade ago. 
As I was a mere eleven years old 
at the time, my music taste was 
still very questionable, and I’m 
not going to go into detail about 
the albums I listened to back 
then (Linkin Park, anyone?). 
Instead, a brief Google search 
tells 
me 
that 
the 
Arctic 

Monkeys’ sophomore album, 
Favourite 
Worst 
Nightmare, 

was released that year. At the 
time of its release, there was a 
lot of pressure on the band to 
produce something as strong 
as their record-breaking first 
album, Whatever People Say 
I Am, That’s What I’m Not. 
Of course, this pressure was 
unnecessary — the album has 
since gone triple platinum in 
the UK.

From the first chords of 

FWN, it’s loud, brash and very 
fast. This is the ‘classic’ Arctic 
Monkeys’ sound that so many 
people fell in love with, and 
it’s a defining album of indie 
rock in the mid-late ‘00s. The 
band is now a regular festival 
headliner, and it’s hard to 
imagine they were destined for 
anything else when listening 
to this album. The songwriting 
prowess has been there from 

the very start. If you stripped 
the album to just a single 
instrument, it would still be a 
great listen.

In stand out track “505,” 

a song about romance and 
distance — the remnants of 
the band’s long world tour 
before this album is clear. This 
is a more cultured band than 

they were in their debut, and 
it shows in nearly all of the 
tracks. Frontman Alex Turner 
seems more self-aware, and 
the 
instrumentals 
carry 
a 

wide array of influences, like 
The Smiths and Oasis. This is 
an album that was written on 
the fly, with nearly half the 
tracks performed and played 
live before the album was even 
released. But, for such a speedy 
release and apparently thrown-
together track list, there are 
no signs of sloppiness. With 
perfect production, there is 
no drop in quality from their 
debut album.

Although 
musically 
FWN 

still stands on its own, some of 
the lyrics are somewhat jarring, 
even ironic now. Turner has 

always written about “fakes” 
and “the industry” with an 
outsider’s 
perspective 
(see: 

“Fake Tales of San Francisco” 
from 
their 
debut, 
and 

“Brianstorm” from FWN). But 
considering where the Arctic 
Monkeys are now, that struggle 
with the concept of fame feels 
odd in retrospect — they’re 
now 
a 
major, 
mainstream 

band. Compared to their most 
recent album, AM, which has 
songs about Alexa Chung, and 
others inspired by Drake and 
Lil Wayne, this album is a large 
jump in tone. FWN era Arctic 
Monkeys were those cool indie 
kids from Sheffield who built 
a following on Myspace. On 
AM, Arctic Monkeys have all 
moved to Los Angeles and now 
ride motorcycles in the Mojave 
desert in their free time.

Clearly, artistic progression 

isn’t a bad thing, and the band 
is an example of that. With the 
several albums between FWN 
and AM, Arctic Monkeys have 
showcased all manners of style, 
and the individual members 
of the bands have explored 
their 
own 
voice 
(drummer 

Matt Helders played for Diddy 
under an alias). It’s a testament 
to just how good this band has 
been throughout their varied, 
decade-long existence. You can 
still go to an indie night club 
and hear “Brianstorm” sung 
back to the DJ, almost word 
for word, ten years later. That’s 
how you know you’ve written a 
classic.

A Technicolor World

Made Out of Music & Machine

In my elementary school 

music class, in addition to 
learning to play the recorder — 
and we played a lot 
of recorder — each 
year we watched 
one movie musical. 
In the third grade 
it 
was 
“Singin’ 

in the Rain.” It’s 
hard even now to 
describe 
what 
it 

felt like to watch 
something like that 
for the first time. 
Sitting on the choir 
risers, 
craning 

my neck to watch 
from the small VCR-only TV 
hanging from the corner of 
the ceiling. It reminds me of 
a poem by Marilyn Nelson, 
in which she recalls hearing 
poetry for the first time. The 
room melted away, and it was 
just me and Gene Kelly and 
Debbie Reynolds.

I have been looking all over 

for that feeling. And I have 
found it here and there, in 
moments of other movies. But 
rarely (almost never) as wholly 
as I did when watching “La La 
Land.”

Recently in my columns, I 

have praised a lot of movies 
for 
being 
“anti-referential,” 

which, in addition to being 
pretentious as hell, I defined as 
movies that exist on their own, 
without homage or reference 
to film history. Movies without 
acknowledgement 
of 
the 

base they were built upon — 
movies wholly unlike those of 
Tarantino, which exist, almost 
entirely, as a series of film 
references and homages.

“La La Land” isn’t “anti-

referential” (and really, nothing 
can 
be); 
it’s 
anti-cynical. 

It’s 
purely, 
unabashedly 

enthusiastic. It loves without 
embarrassment the foundation 
it was built upon. When Ryan 
Gosling slides around that light 
post I could feel in my chest 

the smallest of flickers, a little 
spark of love.

“La La Land” is a film built 

on a foundation of 
love, one that pulses 
through every shot, 
every beat and every 
note.

And it wasn’t just 

another movie about 
the magic of movies; it 
was a movie that was 
magic. 
That’s 
why, 

as I left the theater, 
I was overwhelmed 
with emotion. Movies 
like “La La Land” 
remind me why I love 

what I love.

Something I want to do 

more is give suggestions for 
companion pieces for recent 
movies I have loved. I have a 
pairing suggestion for “La La 
Land.” For maximum effect, 
read Zadie Smith’s latest novel, 
“Swing Time.” The book is 
about two girls, both dancers. 
One “has it” and the other does 
not. But Smith chooses to give 
voice to the one who is never 
going to make it as a dancer. 
Through her, the audience 
sees the world through the 
eyes of someone who loves 
dance, and more specifically 
movies about dance — the very 
same Fred Astaire and Ginger 
Rodgers-type thing that has 
its fingerprints all over “La La 
Land.”

Much like “La La Land,” 

“Swing Time” is interested 
in the way art, especially 
film and dance, shape our 
understanding of the world. 
Much of how the narrator sees 
and interacts with the world 
is shaped by the musicals she 
watched as a child. She talks 
about these movies in a way 
that mirrors how I found 
myself talking about “La La 
Land.” At one point she notes: 
“The opera-like comings and 
goings, the reversals of fortune, 
the outrageous meet cutes and 

coincidences.... To me they were 
only roads leading to the dance. 
The story was the price you 
paid for the rhythm.” This is, 
of course, the perfect rebuttal 
to the argument that the plot 
of “La La Land” is unrealistic. 
The plot is not the point! The 
point is the spectacle that the 
plot lets happen, the song and 
dance, the pure splendor of the 
whole production.

Another thing the two share 

is a certain self-awareness 
of their own nostalgia and 
the danger that that kind of 
dreaminess carries. It seems, at 
first, in “La La Land” that Mia’s 
is more enthralled in her own 
nostalgia — early shots of her 
stand out for their saturated 
colors and her final ballad is an 
ode to the “fools who dream.” 
But, 
it’s 
Sebastian’s 
brand 

of nostalgia, as well as the 
desperation that accompanies 
it, 
that 
becomes 
crippling. 

He’s so wedded to his own 
idea of what jazz needs to be 
that he can’t adapt his dreams 
to the reality of his world. His 
nostalgia becomes his ethos 
and Mia must leave him behind 
— surrounded, quite literally, 
by relics of the past — as she 
moves forwards toward her 
own success.

The 
narrator 
in 
“Swing 

Time” falls somewhere close to 
Sebastian’s breed of nostalgia, 
although hers is a little more 
complex. It’s nostalgia both 
for the art (in this case, movie 
musicals) of her childhood, 
but also the childhood itself 
and the friendship she has that 
colors most of that time.

Although 
perhaps 
more 

the darker cousin than “La 
La Land” ’s true companion, 
“Swing Time” is enhanced 
by and in turn enhances the 
viewing of the movie. I cannot 
suggest 
either 
one 
highly 

enough.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

Some 
might 
argue 
that 

OneRepublic’s 
“Apologize” 
is 

one of the most basic pop songs 
of the 21st century, but the piece 
possesses an instrumental and 
melodic genius that is difficult to 
find in many of the radio hits of 
the past 16 years.

My first experience with 

“Apologize” was just outside 
the smelly gates of the Detroit 
Zoo. I am a wee fourth grader, 
exhausted after a day long field 
trip filled with scorching sun 
and caged animals. My friends 
and I sit in the backseat of our 
parent chaperone’s car, fer-
vently discussing our favorite 
exhibits while the unassuming 
mother looks on, fiddling qui-
etly with the radio knobs of the 
slightly dusted dashboard. She 
finally settles on channel 98.7, 
leaning back as smooth pop rock 
swells to fill the slightly sweaty 
interior of the car. I’m silent 
within seconds, stunned by the 
beauty of the piece.

I 
listen 
intently, 
picking 

at the strains of golden cello 
that weave in and out of the 
piece, jumping a little bit as I 
am prodded back to life by my 
friend, who chuckles at me as 
she realizes I’m mouthing the 
lyrics to myself. Our attention 
slowly shifts from the end of 

our field trip to the song, and 
soon the car has transformed 
into a chorusing, slightly off 
key rendition of “Apologize,” 
with the mother even joining in 
at times.

For the longest time, I didn’t 

have a very personal connec-
tion with music. I never went 
out of my way to discover songs 

that I liked, and as a result, I 
didn’t have a clear idea of what 
I even enjoyed. If my classmates 
decided that a song was hip, I’d 
tag along too. It was a few years 
before I thought to explore 
music for myself; I started out surf-
ing YouTube in an avid search for 
songs to download onto my MP3 
player, then eventually graduated 
to the more streamlined process of 
Spotify. Discovering music that I 
loved was a gradual but reward-
ing process that not only made 
me happier but also cemented 
my shaky self esteem by helping 
me determine key aspects of my 
personality.

“Apologize” 
personifies 

everything 
I’ve 
grown 
to 

cherish about pop music: A 
slow buildup contrasted with 
an intense chorus, a catchy 
tune and dramatically heart 
wrenching, yet easily recogniz-
able lyrics. The combination of 
cello with the faster paced per-
cussion balance each other out 
perfectly, in a way that keeps 
the song mellow but ensures the 
melody never gets so slow that 
it drags. Tinkling piano notes 
add a lightness that helps the 
song move as it unfolds, lending 
the music a delicate, dancing 
nature that further flavor the 
complexity of the melody.

“Apologize” made me nostalgic 

for things I’d never experienced. 
Even though I was yet to have a 
relationship that was even remote-
ly romantic, I’d belt out lyrics with 
the grace and passion typical of 
an angsty teen drama. But what 
I loved most was the cello in the 
background. Back then, I had no 
idea that I’d be playing the cello 
in just a few short years, but even 
without prior string experience, 
I loved the rich resonance of the 
instrument and the depth it added.

Whenever I listen to “Apolo-

gize” today, I’m still struck by the 
artistry of the piece and the same 
cocktail of emotions I experi-
enced back in elementary school. 
It never fails to remind me of the 
way music can impact much more 
than just the present.

STYLE NOTEBOOK

In 2016, the fashion world 

partook in a giant game of 
hide-and-go-seek. 
Which 

designers left their respec-
tive brands? Where were they 
going? Would diversity ever 
emerge as anything more than 
an 
afterthought? 
Who 
was 

going to come forward to vol-
untarily dress First Lady-elect 
Melania Trump? Some of these 
scavenger hunts remain unre-
solved, but they have made one 
thing clear: 2017 will be a year 
of spectating, of observing the 
implications of 2016’s chaos.

Expect an onslaught ethical 

battles. Even in high fashion, 
widespread use of sweatshops 
has persisted into the New Year, 
forcing corporate giants like 
Kering (owner of Saint Laurent, 
Gucci and Puma, among oth-
ers), who have been accused of 
employing immoral labor tac-
tics, to reevaluate their manu-
facturing processes — and fast. 
Although 2016 saw the close of 
ethically-conscious label Suno, 
sustainable, 
sweatshop-free 

brands are infiltrating main-
stream consumerism at a break-
neck pace. Online boutiques 
like Reformation are reaching 
levels of ubiquity that sustain-
able fashion has never seen.

On the positive side of the 

coin, 2017 is bound to give way 
to some seriously revolution-
ary branding. Raf Simons will 
make his debut at Calvin Klein 
next month, which, knowing 
Simons, will likely erect a side 
of the brand that it didn’t even 
know it needed, one full of the 
raw, youthful energy both he 
and CK are known for. Ales-
sandro Michele (Gucci) and 
Demna Gvasalia (Balenciaga, 
Vetements), 2016’s key taste-
makers, are sure to bring even 
more outlandishly styled looks 
and unexpected collaborations 
to the upcoming fashion cycle.

This 
year, 
non-traditional 

models 
will 
continue 
their 

rise to the top. Kickstart-
ed by designer Rio Uribe of 
streetwear label Gypsy Sport 
several years ago, the move-
ment has slowly but surely 
gained speed, thanks in large 
part to exposure provided 
by Instagram. Bald-headed, 
gap-toothed 
beauty 
Simone 

Thompson 
has 
become 
an 

Instagram darling as of late, 

receiving features from the 
likes of Vogue and CR Fashion 
Book by the latter end of 2016. 
Thompson is but one of many 
models that has contributed a 
true sense of diversity to the 
high-fashion scene. Other new 
muses like Barbie Ferreira and 
Hari Nef add serious depth to 
fashion’s coolest band of out-
siders (who, might I add, are 
now surpassing the insiders in 
both numerical and abstract 
terms), paving the way for even 
more diversification in the 
months to come.

Despite all the recent guess-

work, the ever-dreaded fash-
ion cycle will remain chaotic in 
2017. No trillion dollar indus-
try can clean up its act in a 
matter of months, let alone one 
that has relied on an archaic 
system for far too long. Sure, 
more attempts at forging a see-
now, buy-now market will be 
made on an individual brand 
level, but such isolated changes 
cannot turn the entire indus-
try on its head unless they 
appear across the board (and 
they won’t — ahem, traditional 
Paris fashion houses).

Hide-and-go-seek is getting 

old. But something tells me 
we’ll be able to relax a bit this 
year. We should not push our-
selves answer fashion’s most 
abstract questions. 2017 is our 
time to sit back, let the indus-
try unfold as it does, and sim-
ply enjoy the show.

This year, the “Black-ish” star 

threw the notion of “dressing

she faltered.

Best Dressed: Ruth Negga

It takes a special kind of girl

finessed her way to an impec-
cably-cut sequin ensemble just 
a week after the New Year. 
The “Loving” actress’ closely-

her dainty-robot-warrior aura 
in a way that will never be

Janelle 

Monáe (Armani Privé)

I was shocked this was

10-year-old daughter whipped 
out a glue gun and added those 
spots.

Best Dressed: Evan Rachel 

Wood (Joseph Altuzzara)

Her suit not only comes as a 

nice change of pace from the 
usual dresses on the red car-

jacket, the flared trousers and 
the bow on the shirt all push 
the envelope of a traditional 
suit.

In addition to bringing home 

the award for best performance

Recapping the first half of the Michigan hockey season

Through 18 games, Michigan’s 

offense has failed to muster 
a 
consistent 
goal-scoring 

threat, relying on its defense 
and goaltending to keep the 
Wolverines 
competitive 
until 

the final seconds. This weekend, 
Michigan 
will 
face 
another 

challenging Big Ten opponent in 
No. 9 Minnesota, who it split the 
season series with last year.

Before the Wolverines resume 

conference play, the Daily recaps 
the first half of their season:

MVP: Goaltenders
It’s been the same story all 

season. 
Michigan’s 
offense 

struggles to control possession, 
and then the Wolverines must 
constantly defend the puck in 
their own zone. Fortunately for 
Michigan, its trio of netminders 
have 
proven 
themselves 
as 

a solid last line of defense. 
The Wolverines sit dead last 
nationwide in percentage of shots 
taken vs. opponent and as a result, 
Michigan’s 
goaltenders 
have 

faced a barrage of shots. However, 
the trio of Wolverines have 
earned a .924 save percentage, 
good for sixth best nationally.

Freshman goaltender Hayden 

Lavigne 
anchors 
the 
unit, 

ranking third in save percentage 
with a .937 clip. Before an illness 
forced him to miss a few games, 
Lavigne ranked first in goals-
against average. Though he hasn’t 
officially been named the starter, 
statistically, Lavigne has shined 
the most.

Lavigne isn’t the only freshman 

making himself known between 
the pipes. Even though he has 
four losses in seven starts, Jack 
LaFontaine ranks first in saves on 
the Wolverines. Senior forward 
and captain Alex Kile praised the 
young goaltender after a rough 
loss to Penn State last month.

“He’s tough,” Kile said. “He’s a 

freshman, it’s not easy during this 
game. We didn’t really give him a 
great effort tonight defensively. 
We gave up 50-plus shots, so 
anytime you’re a goalie and you 
see 50 shots, it’s tough to win 

games and stop all the pucks.”

Rounding out the goaltenders 

is senior Zach Nagelvoort. While 
not a regular starter, Nagelvoort 
has been called upon multiple 
times this season — like in the 
Great Lakes invitational with 
LaFontaine — when one of the 
two freshmen has faced problems 
early in the game.

The three goaltenders have 

nearly singlehandedly ensured 
that Michigan stays competitive 
late in games.

Most improved player: Sam 

Piazza

On Oct. 7 against Union, Piazza 

scored the Wolverines’ first goal 
of the season at the 8:54 mark 
of the first frame, coming off a 
power play attempt. The game 
against the Dutchmen would 
prove to be the first step in a 
season of tremendous growth 
by the junior forward. Last year, 
it took until the Great Lakes 
Invitational — Michigan’s 17th 
game — for Piazza to notch his 
first goal. It turned out to be 
Piazza’s only goal of the season.

Recognizing 
Piazza’s 

improvement, Michigan coach 
Red Berenson consistently places 
him on both the penalty kill 
and power play, along with the 
Wolverines’ other top scorers.

“He’s a player who hasn’t 

played regularly in his first couple 
years, but he’s shown signs of 
taking the next step,” Berenson 
said in October. “I thought he 
showed some of that last year, and 
we didn’t play him maybe as much 
as we should’ve in the stretch 
run. But we’ve seen moments 
and we have high regard for his 
offensive vision on the ice and his 
puck skills, and now it’s starting 
to pay off for him.”

Through 18 games, Piazza 

ranks third on the Wolverines 
with five goals, including a team-
high three on the power play. 
His continued success on special 
teams will prove essential to 
Michigan as it goes forward.

Top 
freshman: 
Will 

Lockwood

When 
Michigan’s 
offense 

needed a spark plug earlier 
this season, Lockwood would 

outsprint 
the 
opposition’s 

defensemen and attempt a shot 
on goal. For a team that lacked 
veteran 
presence, 
Lockwood 

immediately showed his ability 
to start games on the first line. 
Playing on a unit with Kile and 
fellow freshman Jake Slaker, 
Lockwood used speed to win 
pucks on opposite sides of the ice.

“My skating is one of my best 

attributes,” 
Lockwood 
said 

earlier this season. “It definitely 
helps to have my legs out on the 
ice. There’s also an aspect to it 
where you don’t want to overskate 
on the ice, (to skate) smart on the 
ice, but also use my speed in the 
right situation to my advantage.”

Currently, Lockwood ranks 

first in scoring on the Wolverines 
with seven goals and 13 points. 
He 
also 
leads 
Michigan 
in 

shooting efficiency with a .219 
clip. While many freshmen have 
had to step up in more extended 
roles and learn the Wolverines’ 
playing style quickly, Lockwood 
has demonstrated why he is the 
highest-drafted Michigan player. 
He regularly leads the power 

play and scored twice this season 
on special teams. He has also 
notched a team-high three game-
winning goals.

Though he found himself in a 

scoring drought over the past few 
weeks, he scored in the GLI third-
place game, showing promise as 
the season continues.

Top moment: Lockwood’s 

goal to defeat Michigan Tech

Michigan was in a familiar 

situation. 
Two 
weeks 
prior 

at home, the Wolverines held 
onto a slim lead against Union 
heading into the third period. But 
Michigan couldn’t hang onto its 
advantage, eventually falling to 
the Dutchmen, 4-3.

Against Michigan Tech, the 

Wolverines led 2-1 going into the 
final frame. Within 10 minutes 
however, the Huskies took a 3-2 
lead. Michigan seemed primed 
for a similar fate, but Lockwood 
would not permit it. With 52 
seconds 
remaining, 
senior 

forward 
Max 
Shuart 
passed 

the puck from behind the net 
to Lockwood, who had skated 
toward the middle of Michigan 

Tech’s 
zone, 
and 
Lockwood 

slapped it past the Huskies’ 
goaltender.

“When the game was on the 

line in the third, our team rallied,” 
Berenson said after the game. 
“Even though (Michigan Tech) 
tied the game on a weak goal on 
our part, our team rallied and 
played harder and gave ourselves 
a chance.”

Worst moment: Penn State 

series

In its Big Ten opener, Michigan 

traveled to State College as the 
underdog, but with hopes of 
surprising No. 6 Penn State. The 
Nittany Lions would jump out to 
a 5-0 lead before the Wolverines 
could find the net even once, and 
Michigan ended up losing the 
game 6-1.

The second game was similar. 

LaFontaine saved 53 shots, but 
the offense and special teams 
both struggled in a 5-1 loss. The 
attack mustered a measly 23 shots 
and its power play failed to take 
advantage of its three attempts. 
Defensively, Michigan’s penalty 
kill allowed two goals and 10 shots.

“I didn’t think our team had a 

good game in front of our goalie,” 
Berenson said after the Saturday 
game. “… But (Penn State) got 
behind us, they got through us, 
our forwards weren’t picking up 
men. I mean, give them credit. 
They won all the races, and they 
won all the battles and they got all 
the goals.”

Player to watch in second 

half: Cooper Marody

After a season watching from 

the bench and from the television 
while Michigan traveled, Cooper 
Marody is finally eligible to play. 
The sophomore forward was 
suspended until the Great Lakes 
invitational because of academic 
issues last winter. In just two 
games — a small sample size — he 
notched three assists. Berenson 
clearly 
believes 
the 
forward 

will continue his play from last 
season, inserting him on the first 
line against Michigan State in the 
GLI third-place game.

“The first game back, (it was) 

going to be a lot different than 
just practicing,” Marody said 

during the GLI. “It had been a 
while since I played a game and 
really got up to that speed.”

With Marody returning to the 

lineup, the Wolverines return their 
second-highest leading scorer from 
last season to a group that is lacking 
offensive firepower. In just two 
games, Marody has demonstrated 
his playmaking skills, and he will 
certainly be a player to pay closer 
attention to as Michigan continues 
conference play.

X-factor: Alex Kile
As the leading returning scorer 

of the Wolverines, many expected 
Kile to anchor Michigan’s offense. 
Through much of the first quarter 
of the season — much like the 
entire 
Wolverines’ 
offensive 

unit — he struggled to find any 
consistency. In his first 14 games, 
he tallied just two goals. Recently 
though, Kile has tabbed three 
goals in three contests.

“(Kile) really felt that this was 

not necessarily his team, but this 
was his time,” Berenson said last 
week. “He’d been part of a high-
scoring machine last year, but 
when we lost all of those guys, 
now he looks around and it’s just 
him. He embraced that.

“I can’t tell you it’s gone smooth 

for him — I think it’s been a 
challenge. Maybe he hasn’t had the 
supporting cast. He was playing 
with two freshmen for the first 
number of games, and playing 
pretty well but not playing as 
consistently and productively as he 
would like, or that I would like.”

For Michigan to make any run 

at the postseason, it will need 
its captain to rally his fellow 
forwards. During his recent three-
goal surge, the Wolverines have 
earned two wins and one loss.

It could be just the recipe for 

success that the Wolverines need.

With some signs of life in 

recent games against Wisconsin 
and Michigan State, and the 
return of Marody to the lineup, 
Michigan’s offense looks on the 
upswing.

This 
weekend’s 
matchup 

against Minnesota will provide 
the Wolverines with their first 
test of the second half of the 
season. 

ZOEY HOLMSTROM/Daily

The Michigan hockey team hopes its offense comes alive in the second half.

Michigan defeats Indiana, 78-74

Before the season began, the 

Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 

team 
set 
two 
goals. 
The 

Wolverines wanted to finish in the 
top four of the Big Ten and secure 
a berth in the NCAA Tournament.

Michigan (3-1 Big Ten, 14-4 

overall) took a big step toward 
those ambitions Tuesday night. 
The Wolverines rode a double-
double 
performance 
from 

sophomore center Hallie Thome 
to a 78-74 victory over Indiana 
(2-2, 
12-5). 
With 
Tuesday’s 

victory, Michigan avenged a 77-69 
overtime loss to the Hoosiers 
on Jan. 3, 2016 in which the 
Wolverines blew a nine-point 
lead with four minutes to go in 
regulation.

“That’s definitely something 

we talked about,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico. “We’ve 
definitely have shown growth. 
We’ve shown our ability to make 
free throws down the stretch and 
to take care of the basketball down 
the stretch and even just getting 
some stops.”

For a moment, though, it looked 

like the Wolverines might be 
stunned again.

Michigan 
led 
71-62 
with 

five minutes to go in the fourth 
quarter, a seemingly comfortable 
advantage. But Indiana center 
Jenn Anderson scored six points 
in three minutes, helping the 
Hoosiers narrow the gap to 74-72. 

Ensuring that the Wolverines 

would not be stunned again, senior 
guard Siera Thompson drew two 
fouls in the waning seconds and 
made all four of her free throws to 
ice the game. 

“I am very confident in my free-

throw shooting,” Thompson said. 
“I just went up there and shot like 
I always shoot in practice.”

The game was a back-and-forth 

contest throughout.

The first quarter appeared to 

be going the way of the Hoosiers, 

who led 16-13 with under a 
minute to go despite making just 
35.3 percent of their shots. But 
sophomore guard Nicole Munger 
broke through with three quick 
points to tie the game. She then 
made a baseline layup to put the 
Wolverines ahead, 18-16, as time 
expired in the frame.

“Munger is a scorer,” Barnes 

Arico said. “She’s a great kid. She’s 
one of the hardest workers we 
have in our program.”

Michigan began to open up 

a cushion in the second quarter 
thanks to a bruising performance 
by Thome. In just the first four 
minutes of the frame, she tallied 
seven points and drew two fouls 
as well. Junior forward Jillian 
Dunston contributed two layups 
off turnovers, and the Wolverines 
took a 37-25 edge with 3:09 to go 
in the frame.

“That’s 
definitely 
what 

separated us in the beginning,” 
Thome said. “We were able to get 
fouls on their key players, which 
took them out of what they wanted 
to do so they couldn’t really defend 
without worrying about picking 
up another foul.”

But the Hoosiers had no plans 

to go away quietly. Indiana 

proceeded to go on a 12-0 run in 
just two minutes before freshman 
guard Kysre Gondrezick nailed a 
three-pointer to stop the bleeding. 

Gondrezick scored eight more 

points in the third frame, which 
allowed Michigan to take a sizable 
64-55 lead into the fourth quarter. 
She finished the game with 17 
points and a career-high eight 
assists.

“I was just running within 

the offense,” Gondrezick said. 
“Whatever shot was open, I took. 
Luckily, they just went in.”

With the victory on Tuesday 

night, 
the 
Wolverines 
move 

to third place in Big Ten play, 
behind No. 3 Maryland and No. 
11 Ohio State, both of whom are 
undefeated in conference games. 
Michigan will face the Terrapins 
on Jan. 19, hoping to pull off an 
upset.

Before then, though, Michigan 

will 
have 
to 
contend 
with 

Minnesota on Jan. 15 at Crisler 
Center. 
Though 
the 
Golden 

Gophers are 0-3 in Big Ten play, 
they have had tough match-ups 
against Maryland, Ohio State and 
Indiana, all of whom are in the 
top 60 in the Ratings Percentage 
Index.

Thome shines again in crucial win

With 7:04 left in the first 

quarter, junior forward Jillian 
Dunston corralled a rebound off 
an Indiana 
miss 
and 

promptly 
threw 
it 

across the court to freshman 
guard Kysre Gondrezick at the 
top of the 3-point line.

As an Indiana defender began 

to charge at Gondrezick, she 
launched the ball to a gliding 
Hallie Thome down the middle of 
the court for a smooth transition 
layup.

Just like the layup, the rest of 

Thome’s game followed suit, as 
she finished with 21 points, 10 
boards and two blocks to help 
Michigan to a 78-74 win.

The sophomore center was 

the recipient of four more assists 
from Gondrezick, a connection 
that Thome has flourished from 
since Gondrezick was put in the 
starting lineup Dec. 28.

“That’s definitely something 

fun to play with,” Thome said. 
“We had Madison (Ristovski) 
last year so to have someone in 

that spot and take on her role is 
something special.”

Added Michigan coach Kim 

Barnes Arico: “Kysre is a great 
passer. She does a tremendous job 
of finding Hallie, so we try to keep 
them on the same side sometimes.”

Thome’s success against the 

Hoosiers can also be attributed to 
her physicality. Thome muscled 
her way down low at will, 
tallying three and-1 buckets and 
notching 
her 

second-highest 
rebound 
total 

for the season, 
including 
two 

on the offensive 
end. 
Thome’s 

forcefulness was 
instrumental 
in coercing the 
Hoosiers 
into 

foul trouble.

“That’s what 

definitely separated us in the 
beginning,” Thome said. “We 
were able to get fouls on their key 
players and take them out of what 
they wanted to do.”

When Indiana finally adjusted 

by doubling Thome, her game 
changed entirely from scoring to 
passing out of the low block to the 

wings.

“We were able to get the ball in 

early, and they weren’t ready from 
the start,” Thome said. “In the 
second half, they were doubling 
more in the post, so we were able 
to get the shots and knock them 
down.”

If Thome’s last two games 

didn’t already prove it, her 
performance 
against 
Indiana 

showed that her presence on 

the court makes 
the 
biggest 

difference for the 
Wolverines.

“She has great 

hands and such 
great 
touch,” 

Barnes 
Arico 

said. “Such a great 
finisher 
around 

the rim. When she 
touches it, good 
things are going 

to happen.”

While her double-double stands 

out, the most meaningful part of 
her stat line was her two fouls. The 
Hoosiers simply couldn’t match up 
with Thome, and she managed to 
stay in the game for 36 minutes to 
expose the mismatch.

In 
the 
Wolverines’ 
four 

losses this season, Thome has 
suffered from early foul trouble, 
a point of weakness that both 
Barnes Arico and Thome have 
previously acknowledged. With 
redshirt junior Abby Cole still 
out of commission, it is crucial 
that Thome maintains her recent 
run of play, as Michigan’s depth 
down low runs thin when she 
has to sit.

After giving up a nine-point 

lead last season in Bloomington 
and losing, 77-69, it is reassuring 
that the Wolverines were able to 
eke out a win at Crisler Center 
and pad their NCAA Tournament 
resume. What has become clear 
of late is how instrumental 
Thome will be in the effort to end 
Michigan’s three-year tourney 
drought.

Peppers leaves ‘M’ to 
declare for NFL Draft 

A 
decision 
that 
seemed 

inevitable for months is now 
official. After a season in which 
his versatility and explosive play 
landed him in New York as a 
Heisman Trophy finalist, redshirt 
sophomore 
linebacker 
Jabrill 

Peppers announced Tuesday that 
he will forgo his remaining two 
years of eligibility at Michigan 
and enter the NFL Draft.

Peppers 
informed 
Sports 

Illustrated of his decision Tuesday, 
later sending out a tweet thanking 
the Wolverines and Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh “for the 
memories and preparation.”

Immediately 
following 
the 

Wolverines’ Orange Bowl loss to 
Florida State on Dec. 30 — which 
Peppers was forced to sit out 
after suffering a hamstring injury 
the day before — a visibly upset 
Peppers had told reporters he 
would take as long as he could to 
make a decision about his future.

“It’s one of the hardest things 

I’ve ever had to do,” Peppers 
reiterated to SI on Tuesday. “I’m 
choosing 
between 
cementing 

my legacy as a college player 
and starting my pro legacy. It’s 
something you dream of when you 
were a kid. I was torn between the 
two.”

He finally came to a decision 

over the weekend while at home 
in New Jersey and informed 
Harbaugh on Monday.

Some 
questions 
linger 

about where Peppers will fit 
in at the professional level. He 
primarily played safety in 2015 
and linebacker in 2016, and he 
also took snaps as a slot corner, 
running back and punt returner, 
among other positions, but he 
figures to be a surefire first-round 
pick in April’s draft. ESPN’s Todd 
McShay projects him among the 
top 10 players available.

“All the questions will be 

answered,” Peppers told SI. “And 
they’re good questions. I think I’ll 
be able to show that I can play one 
position well when I focus all my 
time and attention to it. I’m really 
excited to focus on my back pedal, 
flipping the hips and my coverage. 
I’m going to really hone in on that 
and iron out my weaknesses. I 
know my weaknesses and I know 
what I’m good at and need to 
improve on.”

Peppers finishes his Michigan 

career with 125 tackles (21.5 for 
loss), four sacks, a forced fumble 
and an interception on defense. 
He also posted 239 rushing 
yards, 82 receiving yards and five 
offensive touchdowns, as well as 
993 kick/punt return yards with 
one punt return touchdown.

Dakich earns second-semester scholarship

They say good things come to 

those who wait. Andrew Dakich 
certainly knows that now.

Tuesday night, the Michigan 

basketball team posted a video 
on its Twitter account in which 
two 
officers 

from 
the 

Division 
of 

Public 
Safety 

and 
Security 

interrupted 
a 
team 
film 

session 
in 

Crisler Center.

They 

requested that 
Dakich 
leave 

the room and 
follow them to a compliance 
office, before revealing it was 
a prank devised by coach John 
Beilein to inform him that he 
would be receiving a scholarship 
for the winter semester.

The 
mood 
in 
the 
room 

took 
a 
distinct 
turn 
from 

uncomfortable anxiety to pure 
jubilation, as the senior guard’s 
teammates surrounded him in 
celebration. Freshman guard 
Xavier Simpson, however, was 
frozen in his seat. 

“They were in shock,” said 

Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“Xavier was trying to figure 
(it) out. I think once he thought 
(Dakich) was going to jail, he 
didn’t hear anything else. He still 
— at the end — said, ‘Yeah he got a 
scholarship, but he’s going to jail.’ ”

Added Dakich: “To be honest, 

there was one time I almost 
said, ‘Can we talk about this 
privately?’ I almost said, ‘Am I 
being punked?’ 

“But I was like I gotta let these 

guys talk because they’re just 
doing their job. And they came 
out with a document, some kind 
of warrant to get me out of there, 
so it was really scary for me.”

According to Beilein, the 

stunt was inspired by Eastern 
Michigan 
football 
coach 

Chris Creighton. Last August, 
Creighton surprised a walk-

on 
player 
with 
a 
full-ride 

scholarship in a prank that was 
nearly identical to Tuesday’s.

Beilein granted the same 

scholarship to senior forward 
Sean Lonergan last season but 
said it was a tough decision for 
the staff to choose between 
Dakich and Lonergan in 2015.

Dakich 
began 

his 
Michigan 

career 
as 
a 

preferred 
walk-

on in 2013. As a 
sophomore 
and 

junior, 
Dakich 

requested 
a 

redshirt in hopes 
of 
preserving 
a 

year of eligibility 
to 
be 
used 
as 

a 
fifth-year 

graduate transfer.

But when the Wolverines 

suffered season-ending injuries 
at the guard position in both of 
those seasons, Dakich decided 
to burn his redshirt for the good 
of the team.

Now, he has finally been 

rewarded for that selflessness 
with 
a 
second-semester 

scholarship 
worth 
roughly 

$30,000.

Dakich’s 
future 
is 
still 

uncertain, but he would like to 
use his final year of eligibility to 
take on a more significant role for 
another Division 
I 
program 

before pursuing 
his 
dream 
of 

coaching.

While 

Dakich 
won’t 

necessarily 
explore 
his 

options until the 
season is over, 
he said Tuesday 
that he ideally 
would 
like 
the 
opportunity 

to play for a team that runs a 
similar offense to Beilein’s with 
some opportunities to learn new 
concepts as well.

His motivation to become a 

coach is simple.

“When I’m out there on the 

court, or when I’m watching 
Coach Beilein or something 
like that, I find a passion that I 
don’t think about anything else,” 
Dakich said. “And I just think 
about these guys, and it’s just 
easy, to be honest.”

For now, though, the future 

can 
wait 
— 

Dakich has one 
final 
semester 

in Ann Arbor to 
enjoy.

“It’s 
fun,” 

Dakich said. “I 
came 
in 
with 

Zak, 
Derrick, 

Sean 
(and) 

Mark. I’m with 
(Xavier) all the 
time 
because 

I know this is going to be his 
team once Derrick leaves. But 
just enjoying it, and kind of just 
leaving some kind of legacy with 
wins. I don’t care if I score or 
play, being on a special team is 
what I really want to do.”

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Behind Enemy Lines: 
Illinois’s Tracy Abrams

After suffering two losses 

in three games to open its Big 
Ten season, the Michigan men’s 
basketball team will have a 
chance to turn its fortunes around 
on the road against Illinois on 
Wednesday. The Fighting Illini 
are powered by seasoned veteran 
guards Malcolm Hill and Tracy 
Abrams, who lead the team in 
scoring with 18.8 and 10.9 points 
per game, respectively. Despite 
missing the 2014-15 and 2015-16 
seasons after tearing his ACL and 
then his Achilles in back-to-back 
years, 
Abrams 

has come back 
strong 
and 

helped 
carry 

the 
load 
for 

Illinois.

The 

Michigan Daily 
sat down with 
Abrams at Big 
Ten Media Day 
in October to 
talk about his road back from 
injury and his excitement about 
returning to the court.

The Michigan Daily: How 

has your recovery from injury 
been, and how has the extended 
period of time off affected you as 
a player and as a person too?

Tracy Abrams: My rehab 

and stuff has been great. I’m 
pretty healthy right now. I can 
honestly say I’ve gotten stronger, 
I can run a little faster — I’ve 
improved overall — so it’s been 
a great experience for me so far. 
I’m definitely looking forward to 
the season, being out there and 
competing with my teammates. 
Right now we’re just building 
(and) trying to keep putting in 
hard work every day so it can 
translate to the court.

TMD: How excited are you 

to step back onto the floor to 
join your teammates again and 

compete at a high level on the 
college stage?

TA: I’m definitely, definitely, 

definitely excited to be back out 
there. Just using my experience 
and 
my 
leadership, 
most 

importantly, to help those guys 
out as well as them help me (and) 
just continue to grow. I think the 
sky’s the limit for our team so we 
just gotta have that mindset and 
put in that effort.

TMD: This is your sixth year 

of eligibility, so how do you 
think your vast experience at the 
collegiate level will help both you 
and the team this season?

TA: Just being out these last 

couple 
years, 

I was able to 
gain a different 
perspective. 
Learning 
my 

teammates, 
learning the game 
a little bit better, 
so I think just 
using what I’ve 
learned. And if I 
can translate that 

to the court, just knowing my 
teammates and their strengths 
and stuff like that, it would 
definitely, definitely be helpful 
for our team. So I’m just trying 
to keep remembering all that 
stuff and taking it and giving it 
back.

TMD: How do you think you 

will be able to handle the balance 
between a master’s program and 
the rigors of being a student-
athlete?

TA: One advantage with that 

is all my classes are online, so I 
wake up early and do that. That 
way I can have good balance, and 
when I go to practice, I don’t have 
to worry about schoolwork and 
stuff like that. It’s going pretty 
well. I’m in my second master’s 
program right now, so I would 
say I have a pretty good feel to 
how it works and what you have 
to do to be successful.

Wolverines travel to Champaign to take 
on Illinois and find some consistency

In the days since the Michigan 

men’s basketball team loss to 
Maryland on Saturday, the word 
“frustration” 
has been used 
relatively often 
around Crisler 
Center — and 
rightly so.

After 
all, 

the Wolverines 
(1-2 Big Ten, 
11-5 
overall) 

have dropped 
two of their 
last 
three 

games 
by 
a 

combined 
margin of just 
10 points.

Michigan 

isn’t getting blown out by any 
means, which arguably makes 
it even more frustrating. And it 
forces one to wonder what the 
team could be if a new defensive 
approach and new offensive 
weapons molded together into a 
polished product.

The games are there for the 

taking. The Wolverines just have 
been incapable of taking them 
recently.

“Now, we gotta get it, there’s 

no excuse,” said senior guard 
Andrew Dakich. “There’s no, 
‘OK you guys are young, you 
shouldn’t understand this.’ But 
we’re a veteran group.

“We’ve got seniors, juniors 

and a team that went to the 
NCAA Tournament last year. 
It’s time to step up. There’s no 
excuses anymore.”

On 
Wednesday 
night, 

Michigan 
will 
have 
an 

opportunity to back up Dakich’s 
words in a matchup with Illinois 
(1-2, 11-5).

The 
Fighting 
Illini 
are 

essentially in the same boat as 
the Wolverines.

Like Michigan, they are a 

veteran team that returned eight 
upperclassmen. But — also like 
Michigan — Illinois has yet to 
produce the results that could be 
expected from a roster hardened 
by Big Ten play for multiple 
seasons.

The Fighting Illini’s biggest 

threat is senior guard Malcolm 
Hill, who leads the team in points 
and rebounds with 18.8 and 6.2 
per game, respectively. Yet even 
that kind of production hasn’t 
been nearly enough to carry 
Illinois through the beginning of 
conference play.

Through 
their 
first 
three 

games, 
the 
Fighting 
Illini 

notched a win against Ohio State 
but also lost to Maryland and No. 
25 Indiana by 25 and 16 points, 
respectively.

The Wolverines haven’t fared 

much better themselves, as even 
some of their most promising 
players also contribute to their 
growing problems.

Individually, 
sophomore 

forward Moritz Wagner has 
enjoyed an uptick in production, 
as he is averaging 11.9 points 
while shooting 61.3 percent from 
the floor. Redshirt sophomore 
forward DJ Wilson’s newfound 
scoring ability has been an 
encouraging sign as well.

But with their emergence has 

also come a bit of confusion. In 
the past, there was no doubt that 
the offense would run through 
senior guard Derrick Walton Jr. 
or senior wing Zak Irvin. Now, 
though, that choice might not be 
so simple.

The matchup with Illinois 

could prove to be the first step 
toward some clarity in that 
phase.

“It’s good news and bad 

news,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein. “We have several 
guys that can score the ball now, 
especially with the emergence 
of DJ and Moe. We’re looking at 
that very much.

“That was a big part of our 

discussion today — what are we 
doing at shot clock time? We’re 
going to make sure the ball is in 
the right guy’s hands at shot clock 
time, and maybe it’s in nobody’s 
hands and we’re just playing ball 
and trusting what we do.”

The 
more 
pressing 
issue, 

though, is the ongoing struggle 
the Wolverines are having in 
attempting to adopt assistant 
coach 
Billy 
Donlon’s 
new 

defensive schemes.

After Saturday’s loss, Wagner 

was visibly frustrated, explaining 
that there are moments when 
Michigan seems to “fall asleep 
collectively.” And that is even 
more 
concerning 
given 
the 

simplicity of the system.

“(The defense) couldn’t be 

much simpler than it is right 
now,” Beilein said. “We’re doing 
a classic hedge. We’re tagging 
guys. We’re probably doing less 
than we’ve done before. We’re in 
the right places a lot of times, but 

we’re just not in there enough, in 
that right place.”

Through their first three Big 

Ten games, the Wolverines are 
allowing an average of 75.7 points 
per game. Yet back in November 
at Madison Square Garden — 
when Michigan arguably looked 
its best — it allowed an average 
of 57.5 against comparable teams 
such as Southern Methodist and 
Marquette.

The frustrations, then, as 

the Wolverines have alluded to 
plenty of times, boil down to the 
issues of consistency.

Illinois is the second-to-last 

team Michigan will face before 
the beginning of a month in 
which 
the 
Wolverines 
will 

play Michigan State, No. 18 
Wisconsin and No. 25 Indiana 
twice apiece.

Consistency 
has 
been 

preached since the beginning of 
the season. But the time to talk 
about it is running out.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | JANUARY 11TH, 2016


I 

learned the true meaning 

of benevolence in a flea 

market.

As 
a 
16-year-old 
American 

traveling in a place like Costa 

Rica, I didn’t know much about 

the culture, the way of living or 

its people. While there, I learned 

of the immense fighting the 

Costa Rican natives, called Ticos, 

had to suffer through for their 

independence. I learned of the 

consistent poverty the majority of 

Costa Rican communities battle 

every day. I had truly entered a 

universe unknown to me.

“¿520 años y dónde está la paz?”

Translation: “520 years and 

where is the peace?”

These words were spray-painted 

on a cement wall in the center of 

San Jose, the capital of Costa Rica.

As I stopped at a flea market in 

the city, I looked in many of the 

corners and crevices of the tent. I 

looked at wooden jewelry boxes 

for my best friend and wine holders 

for my parents. I found homemade 

candles and oddly shaped purses; I 

did my best to bargain prices with 

the Ticos.

But as I tried to lower prices, I 

was ignorant to the reality of these 

people. They sold handmade items 

for a living 
–– they stood every 

day in the heat trying to sell some 

sort of material, material they 

re-crafted with their bare hands. 

It wasn’t materialistic; it wasn’t 

bogus or cheap. It was someone’s 

precious work, their creation — 

their child, in a sense.

Strolling through, a ring maker 

caught my eye. He sat at a wooden 

table with a burning, iron rod in 

one hand, wrapping and twisting 

metal to shape rings. There was 

a pre-made ring in the shape of a 

treble clef that laid on the table.

“¿Cuánto?” I asked the man.

He proposed a price in colones 

(Costa Rican currency) that was 

equal to about five American 

dollars. Before I left the tent with 

the newly bought ring, the man 

told me to wait one moment.

He held up long piece of copper 

and cut it with pliers. He began to 

wrap the copper around the hot, 

iron wand.

“In Costa Rica, our motto is ‘Pura 

Vida’ or ‘Pure Life’ in English,” he 

said to me in broken English. He 

did not look up.

When he finished, he cupped his 

hands around the ring. Lifting it to 

my eyes, he showed me a hidden 

P in the middle of a V. The letters 

represented the words “Pura” and 

“Vida.” Sun rays filtered through 

the tapestry ceiling of his shop, 

and the copper ring illuminated 

slightly. I smiled, and once again 

asked how much.

“No, no. No money. It’s for you,” 

he answered. “Enjoy your time in 

Costa Rica, and remember, if the V 

points 

towards you, you give yourself the 

energy of pure life. If you point 

it towards others, you give them 

the energy to live pure and to live 

happy.”

My mind raced back to “¿520 

años y dónde está la paz?” I thought 

of the suffering the people of Costa 

Rica have faced. I looked at this 

man who wrapped metal for his 

life. This man had given me more 

than a free ring — in a sense, he 

gave me hope.

Pura Vida is more than a lesson; 

it’s a greeting, a healer and an 

overall way of life.

The piece of metal wrapped 

around my finger reminds me 

each day that I am grateful for 

my own life –– it reminds me 

to be fearlessly optimistic and 

continuously thankful. It reminds 

me 
that 
impoverished, 
kind-

hearted people live in this greedy 

world, but are still fighting for Pura 

Vida.

In that instance, I placed the ring 

on my finger with the V facing the 

ring maker.

I offered the man even the 

smallest tip. With a bright smile, 

he refused. He sat on his throne of 

creations in his kingdom of hope.

“

The last time I threw up, it was 1978. I was in the 
back of my buddy’s pick up truck and I had been 
drinking Seagrams 7 and 7up — we used to call 

those 7 and 7s. Anyway, I had eaten Cheetos before, so 
you can imagine what it looked like.”- My Dad

Almost any time someone in my family talks about 

throwing up, gin or the 1970s, my dad tells the story 
of the last time he puked. If it wasn’t so disgusting, it 
would almost be cute. 

I remember thinking about that story hunched over 

one of those robotic airplane toilets, about 35 thousand 
feet above rural Pennsylvania . I was projectile vomit-
ing the last of the coffee and Odwalla superfood that had 
been percolating in my stomach. My own puke-absti-
nence streak was over. 

I’d been going strong for 8 years until The Airplane 

Fiasco, though it pales in comparison to my dad’s 39-and-
counting streak.Still, it’s respectable in its own right.

I’ll back up. 
 I woke up the day after my grandfather’s funeral and 

my stomach felt like it was upside down. I am terrified of 
flying, so I filed my morning stomach pains under “anxi-
ety induced symptoms” and did my best to forget them. 
Still queasy when we got to the airport, I purchased a 
black coffee and an Odwalla Superfood, which, as you 
already know, would eventually come back to haunt me, 
and anyone between row 18 to 25 on my flight.

Among a set of mild to severe phobias and anxiety dis-

orders I have, Emethophobia — the fear of throwing up 
— is one of them. I’ve been pathologically afraid of vom-
iting for as long as I can remember. 

Throwing up is fucking crazy. I’m sorta surprised 

more people aren’t terrified of it. I mean come on, by the 
end, somehow, the inside of your body is on the outside 
of your body. Like what if humans had this weird kind 
of hiccup or cough that temporarily popped our eye-
balls out, and we had to plug them back in whenever this 
annoying and uncomfortable eye-jaculation happened. 
Its different, but not that different.

In truth though, Emetophobia is relatively uncom-

mon. According to Fear Of.net, it’s the 40th most com-
mon phobia, behind Triskaidekaphobia, which is the 
fear of the number 13, and Gephyrophobia, the fear of 
bridges.

I think someone without capital “A” anxiety could 

still relatively easily conceptualize why someone might 
have Emetophobia: Throwing up is uncomfortable. 
Being afraid of something really uncomfortable seems 
rational. But my Emetophobia is divorced from the actu-
al physical discomfort of throwing up, and more about 
my obsessive need to feel at least marginally in control 
of my own body. 

When you throw up, something which 99% of your life 

is under your control — your stomach — rebels against 
you. Emetophobia is not really about throwing up for me. 
It’s about everything else that could or might happen. If

I can wake up one day with my stomach turned inside 
out, why can’t I wake up one day with a missing eye, or 
a tumor behind my ear, or a loved one dead? Phobias are 
fueled by “what if’s” that worm their way into the con-
sciousness. What if it never ends, what if it gets worse, 
what if I caused it? What if I never stop throwing up and 
end up like that snapchat filter with the rainbows com-
ing out of my mouth forever except it won’t be rainbows 
or a snapchat filter it will be vomit and my real life?

I boarded the plane, and got settled next to a woman 

and her tweenage daughter. I have a window seat, and 
would have traded my kidney for a middle seat just so I’d 
have one less set of legs to bypass. The pilot informed us 
that, because of irregular wind patterns, my normally 5 
and half hour flight from Boston to San Francisco would 
be 6 hours and 15 minutes. Jesus.

We start to take off. I’m releasing enough Fight or 

Flight juices that maybe, with the right coaching, I could 
have moved things with my brain à la El from Stranger 
Things. The What Ifs are shooting out, each one increas-
ingly absurd, but convincing at the same time. It strikes 
me now how accurate the word “pang” is here. What if 
I throw up, what if I die, what if I throw up my left lung 
somehow, and die? What if I throw up Odwalla super-
food and coffee in this aisle right now, 15 seconds into a 6 
hour flight, and then die? I’m gonna throw up. The plane 
is going down. I’m definitely going to throw up. 

 Then suddenly, calm.
“May I go to the bathroom” I asked the mother-daugh-

ter combo to the right of me. The mother looked at me, 
then at the fluorescent seatbelt sign and shrugged.

“Umm, no.”
“Ok.” 
In some combination of resentment and delirium, I 

stood up and puked over both of them, into the aisle — 
gloriously and triumphantly — and then asked if I could 
please please please use the restroom. Stunned, she let 
me by. I power walked to the bathroom aware that I had 
made very few friends so far on this flight.

I puked a few more times, thought about my dad, apol-

ogized to the family I puked over — and on — and some-
how made it back to San Francisco.

I don’t really know where that wave of calm came 

from, but it’s the key to beating Phobias.

The mental and physical energy I spend worrying 

about puking is so much more unpleasant than the actual 
puking, even if it is a strange combination of coffee and 
green smoothie on an airplane.

The only moral of The Airplane Fiasco I can see: Don’t 

worry about things that are out of your control, which is 
a lesson I already vaguely and intellectually understood, 
and rarely adhere to in practice.

I’m still afraid of puking, but I’d estimate I’m 30% less 

afraid of puking than I was prior to the flight, and 30% 
of a diagnosed pathological fear of vomiting is nothing to 
scoff at. And If I don’t puke until 2056, I’ll even a shot at 
beating my Dad’s record. But I’m gonna try not to worry 
about it.

City Reckons with the
Decline of Newspapers

W

ashtenaw County Commissioner 

Conan Smith resigned his elected 

post in August of 2016, after 

accusations that he engaged in a self-serving 

conflict of interest surfaced.

In a letter to the County Board, Mary Morgan, 

former opinion editor of the now-defunct Ann 

Arbor News, alleged Smith was unethically using 

his position as an elected official to secure a position 

as Washtenaw County’s director of community 

and economic development. The position likely 

would have carried a 6-figure salary.

“The board of commissioners is not responsible 

for hiring county employees, other than the county 

administrator,” Morgan wrote. “So there’s no 

reason for commissioners to be involved in the 

hiring process for other county staff, much less a 

single commissioner acting alone.”

Although acknowledging he had been pursuing 

the position, Smith denied any wrongdoing in an 

interview with the Daily.

In October, Smith announced his intention 

to run for re-election to the county commission 

seat he had resigned from just two months 

earlier, taking himself out of consideration for the 

economic development position.

Faced with only write-in opposition — several 

protest candidates and his board-appointed 

interim successor — some of Smith’s former 

constituents said few voters seemed to be aware 

of his conduct, which they attributed to lax local 

media coverage of the issue.

“It’s kind of sad how many people don’t know 

about this situation,” Ann Arbor resident Judy 

Foy said in an October interview. “He’ll just be the 

name on the ballot.”

When Ann Arborites turned out en masse 

for Hillary Clinton on November 8th — Clinton 

carried 68 percent of the county — Smith’s write-

in opponents secured only 9 percent of the vote. 

Ninety-one percent of voters on Ann Arbor’s west 

side were either unaware of Smith’s resignation 

and waffling, or they were content to overlook it.

Some of Smith’s critics would blame a variety of 

factors, from straight-ticket voting to civic apathy.

“He had the luxury of turning his back on the 

people he’s supposed to represent for a couple 

months... knowing that he’ll get re-elected in 

November because of straight-ticket voting,” local 

resident Jeff Hayner told the Daily in October. 

Others — such as Morgan — attributed the 

scandal and Smith’s reelection to a more systemic 

problem: The deterioration of local news coverage’s 

ability to ensure government transparency, 

beginning with the Ann Arbor News’ 2009 closure 

amid flagging revenue.

“If I had not reported on (Conan Smith), it 

wouldn’t have been daylighted,” Morgan said. 

“In terms of things that are happening in our 

government that aren’t getting covered, that is a 

good example.”

On the Monday morning of March 23, 2009, 

Ed Petykiewicz, then-Ann Arbor News editor in 

chief, was seen walking out of his office visibly 

distraught, according to former News copy editor 

Domenica Trevor.

“(Petykiewicz) looked like somebody had 

whacked him in the face with a two-by-four, he 

looked shocked,” Trevor said.

Several minutes later, a staff meeting — with 

almost 100 attendees despite recent waves of 

buyouts — was called with little explanation. 

Many thought a new wave of cuts was about to be 

announced.

Instead of announcing more staff cuts, Ann 

Arbor News publisher Laurel Champion, with a 

pained expression, informed them the newspaper, 

with 174 years of history and 45,000 daily 

subscribers, would cease production that July.

The staff was stunned, and most would be out of 

work in four months.

In a letter to the public later that day, Champion 

wrote the decision by its owners — New Jersey-

based Advance Publications — to close the paper 

was due to declining print advertising revenue. 

Champion also announced the shift of the 

publication’s remaining resources to a soon-to-be-

launched platform, AnnArbor.com.

“We have shared with you before in our pages 

the extreme challenges that our industry and 

our newspaper have faced over the last couple 

years,” Champion wrote. “Out of those challenges 

has come a new opportunity. Our new strategy 

reflects shifting media consumption habits and 

advertising revenue in the newspaper business, 

and particularly in Michigan.”

Though few, if any, Ann Arbor News staff 

expected an outright closure prior to the 

announcement, warning signs of the paper’s 

troubles had been present for years.

The size of the print edition was reduced in 

2007 to cut newsprint costs, according to several 

former staff members. In 2008, Advanced 

Publications announced the News’ copy desk and 

several of its other production functions would 

be downsized and centralized to a Grand 

Rapids office. The size of the staff — including 

newsroom, distribution and business — was 

whittled through attrition and concurrent 

waves of buyouts, from 400 to 272 by 2009. 

Some left of their own accord in the period 

immediately before the closure. Morgan left 

as opinion editor in 2008, after 12 years at the 

News.

“At the time, you could see they were not 

investing in the newsroom and that when 

people left, they weren’t being replaced,” 

Morgan said. “Generally, it did not seem like 

there was a vision from the leadership.”

Trevor, seeing poor future prospects for her 

role as a copy editor at the News, accepted a 

buyout offer in late 2008, though she continued 

working through July 2009. She now works as 

a paralegal and freelance copy editor in Ann 

Arbor.

“A bunch of people were offered buyouts,” 

Trevor said. “Any copy editor with any sense 

took it because there was an ‘opportunity’ for 

employment in Grand Rapids, but we were 

being told it’s just not going to happen.”

The Ann Arbor News staff was promised an 

opportunity to apply for positions at the new 

publication, AnnArbor.com and about a dozen 

employees were retained, according to several 

former staff members. The rest moved to other 

publications, freelance positions or entirely 

new careers.

The market trends ending The Ann Arbor 

News were hardly confined to Ann Arbor. Until 

the advent of the Internet, most medium-sized 

cities could support at least one independent 

daily print publication that could reap healthy 

profit margins by holding a de-facto monopoly 

on local classified ad sales.

Although the Internet would begin eroding 

newspapers’ competitive advantage as a one-

stop shop for local advertisers in the 1990s 

and early 2000s, newspapers were largely able 

to weather the changing market. Total U.S. 

newspaper ad revenue would peak in 2005 at 

$49.4 billion — even when daily subscriptions 

had been in decline for years — according to 

Pew Research.

Freefall ensued during the 2007 financial 

crisis and the subsequent recession. Newspaper 

ad sales plummeted 60 percent below their pre-

recession peak to $19.9 billion by 2014 (the last 

year the Newspaper Association of America 

published figures), as advertisers realized they 

could target audiences more effectively online 

and slashed their print spending.

The employment prospects of newsroom 

staff have followed their employers’ tanking 

earnings. The number of U.S. newspaper 

employees plunged by 40 percent from a pre-

recession peak of 55,000 to 32,900 in 2014.

In the decade between 2004 and 2014 at 

least 126 daily papers closed, according to 

industry publication Editor and Publisher, 

and the approximate 1,300 that remained 

increasingly had to make do with less. The 

same year The Ann Arbor News ceased 

production, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer 

moved solely online, and both The Detroit 

News and The Detroit Free Press cut their 

print schedules to three times per week. With 

its stock price slipping below $5, the New York 

Times Co. was only dissuaded from shutting 

The Boston Globe — one of its properties — 

when the Globe’s employees agreed to $20 

million in concessions.

AnnArbor.com — which fully merged into 

the Mlive brand in 2013 — is a leaner operation 

than its predecessor. The print schedule was 

cut to twice a week and its copy desk, sales, 

production, circulation and sports coverage 

were consolidated into its parent company’s 

statewide operation alongside seven other 

local papers.

Individual reporters are saddled with greater 

responsibilities than their forerunners: They 

cover multiple beats, take their own photos 

and run their own social media, according to 

Jenn McKee, a former entertainment reporter 

at the Ann Arbor News and MLive .

“Really focusing on your writing and 

having that be your calling card isn’t enough; 

you really need to be a more well-rounded 

journalist and be able to offer all those things,” 

Mckee said. “That’s a pretty sharp shift for 

people who have been doing this for a while to 

make.”

John Hiner, vice president of content at 

MLive, said the economic realities of the news 

industry make the scale of old local newspapers 

financially unrealistic, and traditional media 

companies must increasingly explore alternate 

sources of revenue.

“We don’t dream about putting everything 

back the way it was,” Hiner said. “But I think 

you can find continued growth in digital 

revenue.”

Hiner further said MLive has prioritized 

preserving its reporting capacity, explaining 

that while about 25 staff members work in the 

Ann Arbor office — less than 10 percent of the 

272 who were in 2009 — most cuts have been to 

non-editorial positions, like those consolidated 

under 
MLive’s 
statewide 
functions. 
He 

estimated this means the reporting staff is 

The Twilight of 
Newspapers in Ann 
Arbor:

b y B r i a n K u a n g, D a i l y S t a f f R e p o r t e r

between 
one-third 
and 
half 
of its pre-

2009 headcount.

He also admitted not as much coverage is 

possible with fewer staff members, but argued 

that the web-based platform of MLive makes 

news more immediate to its audience.

“The Ann Arbor News used to be at every 

school board meeting, every city zoning 

meeting, every library meeting,” Hiner said. 

“We still go to those things when they’re 

newsworthy and important to the community, 

but we don’t babysit boards and council to 

the degree we used to when we had more 

resources.”

Jen 
Eyer, 
who 
held 
various 
editorial 

leadership roles at MLive’s Ann Arbor office 

until 2016 and is now communications director 

for gubernatorial candidate Gretchen Whitmer 

(D), described maintaining Ann Arbor coverage 

as a “constant struggle,” but expressed 

admiration for the dedication of the remaining 

staff in the face of challenges.

“It pains me to hear the criticism they 

sometimes get,” Eyer said. “That newsroom 

and the whole organization is still filled with 

journalists who believe in the mission of 

journalism.”

While acknowledging the efforts of MLive’s 

staff, many local residents say the consequences 

of large staff cuts and the reduction of printing 

to twice a week are difficult to ignore.

Vivienne 
Armentrout, 
former 
county 

commissioner 
and 
long-time 
Ann 
Arbor 

resident who actively blogs about city issues, 

said the loss of daily print distribution has 

steeply affected public awareness of local news.

“I was here when we actually had an 

afternoon paper … we could be sure that 

virtually every resident of Ann Arbor was 

reading the same news as you were reading,” 

Armentrout said. “There was sort of a common 

community memory, and now a lot of people are 

pretty ignorant of what’s going on.”

These sentiments were echoed by City 

Councilmember Jack Eaton (D–Ward 4).

“I have to tell you that (MLive reporter) Ryan 

Stanton covers City Council very well,” Eaton said. 

“But the public doesn’t necessarily read everything 

he writes because it’s only published twice a week 

and not very many people bother to subscribe to it.”

Both Eaton and Armentrout added that they 

see less long-form investigative reporting, and it is 

evident the smaller staff is spread thinner than its 

predecessors.

“A local person who’s involved, such as myself, 

kind of has to piece together the news,” Eaton said. 

“You need to listen to WEMU, because they do 

fairly good local coverage, you need to hunt down a 

copy of The Ann magazine.”

A year after the News’ closing, The Ann 

magazine, a monthly glossy magazine featuring 

long-form pieces on local news, was launched.

Jim McBee, creative director of The Ann, has 

worked at a variety of local papers in California, 

the Carolinas and Wyoming. However, he found 

himself increasingly disillusioned as long-term 

prospects soured.

“While I was still in newspapers, I just felt 

like I was just riding it out,” McBee said.

As The Ann Arbor News was closing shop, 

McBee’s former co-worker Kyle Poplin was in 

Ann Arbor on a Knight-Wallace Fellowship, an 

award for mid-career journalists to study at 

the University of Michigan for a year. Poplin 

saw an editorial void left by the News’ closure 

— a lack of in-depth longform reporting — and 

reached out to McBee, ultimately conceiving 

the magazine.

“Our desire editorially is to do the big 

projects newspapers used to do,” McBee said. 

“That’s the idea, to do the big in-depth story … 

that newspapers have a really hard time doing 

now because they’ve fired all their experienced 

reporters.”

In the past year, The Ann has featured 

stories on topics such as the local startup scene, 

emotionally heavy profiles of homelessness in 

Washtenaw County and a piece from Morgan 

outlining 
the 
circumstances 
surrounding 

Conan Smith’s resignation. A large portion of 

content comes from freelance writers, while a 

core team of four manages editing, production 

and advertising sales.

Each month, 18,000 copies are printed and 

distributed through direct subscriptions and 

a distribution partnership with The New York 

Times and The Wall Street Journal, which 

include The Ann as an insert in local deliveries 

to respective papers.

McBee readily admits, however, that no 

monthly publication can fully substitute the 

day-to-day 
and 
breaking 
news 
reporting 

capacity of a daily newspaper. By relying 

heavily on freelancers, the Ann cannot readily 

do follow-up coverage on recurring issues, 

particularly local government.

“I don’t know if I would structure beats the 

way a newspaper does, but the fact that I don’t 

have a staff of reporters … is a little frustrating,” 

McBee said. “Somebody needs to be keeping an 

eye on government officials, on businesses, on 

whatever. I think it’s a glorious golden age for 

graft and corruption.”

Some Ann Arborites were not daunted by 

the task of holding local government to task, 

though. When Morgan departed from The Ann 

Arbor News shortly before its demise, she and 

her husband, Dave Askins, launched The Ann 

Arbor Chronicle, a Web-based publication 

focused on local government, in September 

2008.

Aiming to increase civic awareness and 

participation, the couple sought to fill a 

vacuum left in local government coverage 

by the departure of the News. Their site 

primarily featured detailed chronicles of local 

government meetings and decisions, while 

also including original analysis of local policy 

issues, columns and cartoons from freelancers.

“By covering government the way we did, 

we could lower some of the barriers to entry,” 

Morgan said. “The idea was: If people want to 

know what’s happening so they can get more 

involved, we would provide them with that 

information.”

Raising revenue through advertising sales to 

local businesses and “voluntary” subscription 

fees — the Chronicle was a for-profit entity — 

Askins said their site drew between 30 and 40 

thousand unique users per month. The couple 

was adamant, though, that their success be 

measured not by their readership but by their 

impact on the functioning of civic life.

Though 
the 
Chronicle’s 
revenue 
was 

sufficient to cover its costs and the couple’s 

living expenses, Askins and Morgan found a 

fundamental challenge: Covering every public 

meeting could consume as much as 80 hours 

per week, even with freelancers’ help.

They determined it would not be possible to 

scale up the Chronicle’s revenue to hire full-

time staff without compromising key elements 

of their publication. In an August 2014 post, 

Askins announced the Chronicle would end 

publication.

“In past columns I’ve compared this kind 

of labor to running a marathon — with one 

key difference: There is no finish line,” Askins 

wrote. “You can never really finish. But as a 

practical matter you will quit running one day. 

And if you never decide to stop, then when you 

do stop, it will be because you are dead. So 

we’re setting an end date as a kind of artificial 

finish line.”

That September, a final post was made on the 

Chronicle: A heartfelt farewell from Morgan.

The Chronicle’s departure put residents 

in the same predicament they felt when the 

Ann Arbor News began downsizing — a lack 

of investigative city coverage. Many residents, 

including Eaton, still remember the Chronicle’s 

reporting fondly.

“The Chronicle wasn’t really traditional 

journalism, it was exhaustive journalism where 

you’d get 15,000 words on one meeting,” Eaton 

said. “It was a great resource for activists or 

board members like myself … and I don’t expect 

a daily newspaper like MLive or anybody else to 

do that kind of exhaustive meeting coverage.”

Now, Askins is on his way out of the city he 

has covered for so long. This week, he filled 

a U-Haul to move to Madison, South Dakota 

(pop: 7,258) to start again as a local journalist.

Despite having a population less than one-

tenth of Ann Arbor, Madison has maintained its 

daily print paper — the Madison Daily Leader — 

which he and Morgan credit to the publication’s 

ownership by the same local family for multiple 

generations.

Morgan plans to remain in Ann Arbor for 

the “medium term,” until she can transition the 

leadership of her civic engagement nonprofit 

— the CivCity Initiative — which she began 

after the Chronicle closed, before joining her 

husband in Madison.

While acknowledging he would miss Ann 

Arbor — which he has called home for the last 

two decades — Askins bristled with optimism 

for what new adventures would await him out 

west.

“The work of a local journalist, if you do it 

well … you make the place you live in better, 

because it allows more people to participate 

in the life of the community than otherwise 

would be able to,” Askins said. “That’s the work 

I want to do ... Ann Arbor’s clearly not the only 

place you can do it, and it’s not clear to me you 

can work as a local journalist in Ann Arbor 

anymore.”

In early 2016, the last two Ann Arbor News 

staff members to remain through the entire 

transition to MLive — McKee and Managing 

Producer Cindy Heflin — were laid off. Heflin 

is now a copy editor at the Detroit Free Press, 

while McKee works as a freelance reporter. 

Today, MLive continues to serve the Ann Arbor 

news market.

“I harbor no malice against MLive,” McKee 

wrote in a text message. “They’re just trying to 

make it through this era, as every news outlet 

is.”

M

y mother comes from a family 

of blonde Irish Catholics with 

smooth, compliant hair. Maybe 

she was blindsided by the delicate way 

my curls framed my head as a toddler, soft 

ringlets that formed a gentle puff of yellow 

around my head. It would become clear that 

I inherited the Jewish father’s hair: frizzy, 

twisted locks, thick and prone to expanding 

upon contact.

It’s not her fault that my mom didn’t know 

the rules of curly hair. She would brush it 

out, often resulting in abundant static and 

the dreaded “yield sign” effect christened by 

Mia Thermopolis of “The Princess Diaries.” 

I spent ages 4 to 7 with puffy bangs, and 

in a third-grade picture I wore an orange 

athletic sweatband as a fashion (?) accessory, 

brandishing a full Tweety Bird forehead and 

a sea of cowlicks parted down the middle.

When I was young, my hair frustrated 

me. My sister and I would cry when it got 

combed out. I envied my cousins’ pale blonde 

hair, cascading over their shoulders and 

swishing around their bodies when they 

walked. At infrequent haircuts I would tell 

the hairdresser that I didn’t want my hair 

to make me look like a triangle anymore, to 

which she would laugh and promise that 

things called “long layers” and “product” 

would solve those woes.

When she was done I would climb down 

from the chair, smile and thank her politely, 

feeling even more triangular than before.

During tweenhood a lot of curly girls I 

knew took to their straighteners, opting 

for sleek and flattened looks, especially for 

special occasions, and this left me torn. I 

grew up with other curly-haired women 

who praised costly chemical treatments and 

straightened their hair so frequently that it 

was hardly curly anymore. There was nothing 

wrong with this, but I knew deep down that 

process was time-consuming, and I was not 

patient enough. I knew deeper down that 

my curly hair was maybe a marker of my 

Jewishness. For me, straightening my hair 

was an attempt to make something different 

about me disappear.

When I was a shy 14-year-old, a boy 

I thought was cute touched my hair 

unexpectedly. I was flustered and flattered at 

first. Then he continued: “It’s so … coarse.” 

I blushed and shrugged it off without saying 

anything, but vowed to condition religiously, 

focusing on the ends. Nobody was going to 

call my hair coarse again, especially 

not cute boys. I grew more and more 

self-conscious of having hair that 

was 
unpredictable 
and 
somehow 

“different” — it felt like it was always 

taking up too much space, too much 

time or shedding onto someone’s 

carpet.

There have only been a few times 

I’ve had my hair straightened — the 

lengthy process takes up to two hours. 

When someone asks if I like my hair 

straight, I’m not even sure how to 

respond. I like the way it feels when it 

brushes against my shoulders. I like it 

the way I like a pet: The sleekness and 

smooth silky texture is all right for a 

night, but it has never been worth the 

effort for me.

I could tell them I seem to get more 

male attention with straight hair. Even 

friends have paused to say, “Maria, you 

look … different,” and something in 

the pause seems to be something of an 

admiration I didn’t know could exist. I 

could tell those who ask that it makes 

me look nothing like myself.

As I get older, I’ve started to make 

peace with my hair. I avoid brushes 

at all costs, and swear by minimal 

shampoo and maximum moisture. I 

like that I can be easily picked out of a 

crowd by it, and I like it as an accessory 

to my sub-par dance moves. People, even 

the occasional stranger sometimes, say nice 

things about my curly hair, and I don’t really 

know how to feel about it — I usually blush.

In “Paradise Lost,” Milton rewrites Adam 

and Eve, going into detail about Eve’s hair, 

a tangled mess that is somehow enticing and 

intoxicating. Milton describes her hair as 

“wanton” even, which suggests that Eve’s 

untamable mane is just one of the things that 

contributes to the babeliness that makes Adam 

want to kiss her and eat the fruit and disobey 

God and all that wild stuff. Amid objectively 

sexist 
undertones 
of 
women 
as 
mere 

promiscuous objects of the male gaze, I admit 

that I found the characterization somehow 

humorous, comforting and unnerving. What 

if this frizzy brown mess could be the seat of 

power?

This is not to say that I don’t sometimes wish 

for frizz-free hair that looks like a Pantene ad, 

or hair that would take nicely to all of these hip 

shoulder-brushing cuts so many of my friends 

have been getting, but I do think there is 

something more than hair here. For example, 

that boy who touched my hair without asking 

and said it felt “coarse” is definitely a jerk, and 

I can’t help but hope the tragic poofy bangs 

made me a little tougher on the inside.

Part of me wants to hold on to a complicated 

story I’ve let my hair tell, but another part 

wants to say, “it’s just hair, it doesn’t have to 

mean anything.” Couldn’t I just shave it off 

or ignore it or write about something more 

important?

In asking these questions, I resist the urge 

to let something as superficial and arbitrary as 

a collection of dead cells define me, yet maybe 

that choice isn’t even one that is up to me. I 

can’t ignore the fact that I have been exposed 

to constructions of female beauty that come 

in sleek and uncomplicated packages.

I joked to a curly-headed friend of mine a 

few weeks ago that our curly hair drew us to 

all things cozy — fluffy blankets, snuggling, 

semi-sloppy clothing, small animals. But it’s 

not even about texture. Maybe it’s the freedom 

that comes with letting something just be, in 

all its messiness and unpredictability.

I don’t mean to paint this as a picture of a 

purely “chill” girl who has come to complete 

peace with all parts of herself. Though I no 

longer have crippling fear of triangle head 

(and if you have a negative comment on my 

hair, I have cultivated some choice words 

for you), I still think that such in-depth 

contemplation and anxiety on something 

superficial is strange in a way I can’t seem to 

shake.

It continues to vacillate between feelings of 

importance and unimportance. It continues 

to contain the pieces of my parents, and their 

parents. My hair continues to take up space 

— to frizz, to tangle, to shed and to grow. My 

hope in all this tangly mess is to only do the 

same.

Wednesday, January 11 2017 // The Statement 
7B

A 

little under a month ago, I received a Facebook 
notification that the Regal Cinemas Bethesda 
movie theater in my Maryland hometown 

was shutting its doors after more than 20 years of busi-
ness. “Thank you, Bethesda. We will miss you” has now 
replaced the multiplex’s film titles that used to casually 
scroll across the marquee.

What was once a staple of downtown Bethesda slowly 

became a deserted theater with sometimes more employ-
ees than movie-goers milling about the concession stand. 
What was once a hotspot where the likes of boxer Mike 
Tyson, sportscaster James Brown and I — yeah, I’m feel-
ing I should be in the same category — would go to catch 
a movie on a Saturday night, is now merely a place to meet 
up with friends. The place where ushers once donned 
burgundy uniforms with ear pieces and perfect customer 
service turned into a place constantly plagued with air 
conditioning failures in the summer months and teen-
age workers who were too busy to clean up the popcorn 
crumbs and soda spills in Theater Eight.

I had two or three birthday parties at Regal Bethesda, 

as we referred to it. I don’t even remember what the mov-
ies were or how old I was, but I distinctly remember those 
birthdays as being some of the best. Going to the movies 
with a bunch of friends, passing popcorn down the row 
to make sure everyone got some. Racing over to the candy 
machines, sliding quarters into the slots and eagerly 
awaiting a handful of M&Ms to drop into my cup. After-
ward, heading next door to Uno’s Pizzeria (sadly, also a 
distant memory) to construct make-your-own pizzas.

What was once a special experience, from birthday 

parties to date nights, became a way to go out with others 
without having to talk to them for at least an hour and a 
half. What used to be appreciated by everyone had mere-
ly been demoted to satisfying middle schoolers enjoying 
their newfound independence, senior citizens attending 

10 a.m. screenings to ensure the matinee rate and small 
children mesmerized by the newest animated sensation. 
What used to be a place where people of all ages went to 
make memories became just a building with too many 
seats.

With the demise of Regal Bethesda goes the theater 

of my childhood, along with old-school aspects of movie 
theaters that have been lost in the shuffle and replaced 
by newer — but not always better — features. The spon-
taneity of movies has been replaced by expensive tickets 
that must be reserved at least a day in advance to claim a 
good seat. Yes, reserved seats in a movie theater is now 
the norm. No more pushing in line to grab a good seat to 
the latest box office hit. Just like everything in our lives 
nowadays, something as classic as going to the movies 
can be purchased without any human interaction needed 
at all. The adventure can be calculated and meticulously 
planned into our schedules.

But reserved seating aside, there is nothing like going 

to the movies. The lights dim, you sit back in your seat, 
brace for impact and delve into the storyline. And for the 
next two hours, you’re immersed in darkness and trans-
ported to another universe. Watching movies in a theater 
on a big screen will never change for me. From trailers to 
credits, I instantly become invested in the characters and 
the plot and the setting, the dialogue and the music and 
everything that encapsulates the story set before you.

For two hours, it’s a constant fight worth fighting — 

combatting the talkers, the texters and those who open 
their candy wrappers with such ferocity that it seems like 
they need to bring in the National Guard to open a stu-
pid bag of Skittles. It’s watching previews and mentally 
noting which films you want to see and others that you’ll 
take a hard pass on — including the requisite thumbs up 
or down motion you give to your friend sitting next to 
you.

For those fleeting hours, you forget everything that’s 

not in that one theater on that one screen — your bad day, 
your looming exams, your laundry list of things to do. 
Because for just this magical moment, none of that mat-
ters. The only thing that matters is what’s on the silver 
screen.

When I was 2 years old, I saw my first movie, “The 

Emperor’s New Groove.” When I was 3, I saw “Ice Age,” 
but walked — actually more like sprinted — out of the 
theater because the tiger scared the living hell out of me. 
When I was 5, I saw the new “Peter Pan” movie with my 
mom and was afraid to even step foot into a large, dark 
room and watch a movie with just four people in the the-
ater. When I was 6 years old, I saw “Because of Winn-
Dixie” and threw up 20 minutes into the movie because 
I had food poisoning. I never did find out what happened 
to that dog.

At Regal Bethesda, I saw my first PG-13 movie, “Shall 

We Dance” and my first R-rated movie, “The King’s 
Speech.” I also snuck into “22 Jump Street” even though 
it was R-rated and I was too young to buy a ticket and 
went to a “double-feature,” paying for one movie, then 
slipping into a second right after (I know, I’m sort of a 
badass).

Over winter break, my mom and I went to see the 

instant smash-hit musical “La La Land,” a genuine 
throwback to classic cinema. This film perfectly solidifies 
why films are so special, especially on the large screen. 
The surround-sound that grabbed me into a world full of 
song and dance, the bright colors pristinely displayed in 
high-definition quality that fully engrossed me into the 
plot, were electrifying. This is the power of coupling a 
wonderful film with an irreplaceable movie theater expe-
rience.

All these memories come from going to the theaters. 

Not sitting in bed watching Netflix on my laptop or 
streaming Hulu on my iPhone, but actually going out to 
the movies. And, yes, it’s well worth the investment of 
paying upward of $14 a ticket.

Not only do I have less time to see movies in theaters 

while I’m at college, but the rise of online streaming and 
television has unfortunately made going to movie the-
aters somewhat irrelevant and pointless. Unless you’re 
a film student or, in my case, have a parent in the film 
world, the luxury of sitting in plush theater seats sur-
rounded by the requisite popcorn aroma no longer feels 
so compelling to my generation.

I’m a film buff who demands no interruptions during 

my movies. Maybe I’m old-fashioned. Yes, I’m the same 
guy who also likes holding a newspaper in my hand and 
wandering around bookstores for hours upon hours. But 
the movies are sacred in theaters, more important than 
anything else in the world at that exact moment when the 
lights go down and the image spreads across the screen.

Sadly, I missed the opportunity to experience one last 

film at Regal Bethesda before its doors closed. But luckily 
I have endless childhood memories to help me move for-
ward. Thank you, Regal Bethesda, for doing your part in 
showing me the power of film in its truest form — across 
the theater’s largest screens. I will miss you.
