ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

UpRound, a new University of 

Michigan student organization 
for any undergraduate student 
interested 
in 
learning 
more 

about venture capitalism, hosted 
its first annual training and a 
competition on Saturday.

Engineering 
sophomore 

Jonah Erlich founded the group 
along with LSA junior David 
Silverman, Business sophomore 
Adarsh 
Rachmale 
and 
LSA 

senior Bradley Baum. Elrich said 
the group decided to start the 
organization 
after 
competing 

in a similar one competition at 
Carnegie Mellon University. 

“We need to teach the broader 

university about what venture 
capital 
is, 
and 
engage 
the 

community with what’s going on 
in the entrepreneurial ecosystem 
today,” Elrich said.

Erlich and Silverman are 

members of the Entrepreneurial 
Leadership Program and wanted 
to open up the world of venture 
capitalism and entrepreneurship 
to any University students.

“We founded this six months 

ago and it’s been a sprint ever 
since,” Erlich said. “(The Ross 
School of Business) ran a similar 
competition and we came in and 
said, ‘Look, we think we would 
do a great job at appealing to a 
wider audience and getting more 
students involved that aren’t in 
Ross,’ and they took a chance 
on us, and we increased the 

application numbers.”

The co-founders said they 

were 
expecting 
about 
50 

applicants, but received over 80.

“We 
hosted 
three 
open 

training 
sessions,” 
Silverman 

said. “Through those three, 
the dinner and tonight, we will 
have over 200 different students 
interact with UpRound in some 
capacity.”

To those involved in the 

organization, UpRound’s large 
applicant 
pool 
suggests 
the 

University might be a growing 

hub 
for 
entrepreneurial 

innovation and high growth 
potential investments.

“If you look at Silicon Valley, 

the model of it is that you have 
Stanford and Berkeley feeding 
San Francisco and here we have 
the power of (the University of) 
Michigan; we have the research 
powerhouse 
to 
fund 
Grand 

Rapids and to fund Detroit,” 
Silverman said.

The UpRound competition 

serves as a publicity event and 
training for students because 

it brings venture capitalists to 
the University to engage with 
students, witness the talent and 
expose students to successful 
businessmen and women, many 
of whom were University alumni.

“Bringing them here to see the 

Michigan ecosystem in addition 
to 
having 
this 
competition, 

they’re realizing that this is 
a place to start investing in,” 
Silverman said. 

Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
Areel 

Al-Lami, who was born in Ann 
Arbor but raised in Saudi Arabia, 
has seen immigrant communities 
in Ann Arbor struggle with 
language barriers, false cultural 
assumptions 
and 
a 
lack 
of 

technological 
literacy, 
which 

she believes could be alleviated 
through diversity initiatives. 

She attended the Traveling 

Innovation Hour’s fourth meeting 
of the year to discuss her ideas with 
a group of people who could offer 
diverse opinions and solutions.

The Traveling Innovation Hour 

met Friday morning to discuss 
initiatives in education with an 
intimate group of University of 
Michigan 
faculty, 
professors 

and students. The new initiative 
is co-hosted by the Office of 
Academic Innovation and seeks to 
start a conversation on the issues 
students and faculty face in the 
classroom.

Traveling 
Innovation 
Hour 

is open to the public and serves 
as preparation for the Academic 
Innovation Initiative Summit on 
November 14. Friday’s meeting

Each week, The Michigan Daily 

will be publishing a wrap-up of 
the most important bills proposed 
in Michigan Legislature over the 
past seven days:

SB 620: This bill would amend 

a 1976 law on sexual education to 
require the teaching of consent 
in sexual education programs in 
school, to address sexual assault, 
bystander 
intervention 
and 

dating violence.

State 
Sen. 
Curtis 
Hertel, 

D-East Lansing, proposed the 
amendment to the bill, calling it 
“Yes Means Yes” legislation in 
the press release on his website.

“College-aged women are four 

times more likely than any other 
age group to face sexual assault. 
When we send our kids off to 
college, we should worry about 
their grades and how they are 
going to pay for their books, not if 
they will be sexually assaulted,” 
Hertel said in the press release.

The bill aims to clarify the 

definition of consent, including 
what it looks like in a committed 
relationship.

SB 629: This bill seeks to 

modify the sexual education

Though many might think the 

future of mobility lies in flying 
cars and jetpacks, experts say 
the future entails dependence on 
equity of mobility companies and 
policy framework needed for a 
revolution. 

At 
least, 
that’s 
what 

professionals in transportation, 
economics, 
energy 
and 
the 

environment discussed Friday 
for the University of Michigan 
Energy Institute’s fourth TE3 
Conference. 

The 
conference 
featured 

multiple 
researchers 
who 

presented 
their 
work 
and 

conclusions before the crowd 
of roughly 150 faculty members 
and 
students. 
Following 
the 

presentation of research projects, 

there were panel discussions 
and Q&A sessions for audience 
members to have an exchange 
with 
the 
presenters. 
There 

were 
also 
frequent 
breaks 

where attendees had informal 
conversation and networked.

The 
conference 
brought 

scholars from other universities 
like Arizona State University 
and the University of Chicago 
to speak about their work in 
each field in order to present 
an interdisciplinary view of the 
future of transportation.

Engineering 
Junior 
Matt 

Jankowski spoke to The Daily 
about the benefits of having the 
conference include work from 
a wide array of fields saying, 
“I’m glad that attention is being 
devoted to looking at (autonomous 
vehicles) in an interdisciplinary 
way, 
because 
when 
new 

Conference 
touts future 
of mobility,

Charles Blow discusses role of 
media during Trump presidency

Over 1,000 gather for talk hosted by Humility by the Age of Self-Promotion organization

Discussing the role the media 

played 
— 
and 
continues 
to 

play — in Trump’s election and 
presidency was the central theme 
of The New York Times’s visual 
op-ed columnist, Charles Blow’s 

talk “President Donald Trump, 
Arrogance and Democracy,” Friday 
evening. 

Blow 
was 
greeted 
with 
a 

standing ovation by an audience 
of over 1,000 people in Rackham 
Auditorium 
after 
having 
been 

invited 
to 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan by the Humility in the 
Age of Self-Promotion Colloquium, 

in conjunction with many other 
local organizations such as the 
Michigan Radio and the Ann Arbor 
District Library.

Jamie Vander Broek, a librarian 

for the School of Art & Design at 
the University and one of the event 
organizers, explained she and 
her fellow co-workers felt it was 
important to invite Blow to speak 

because of his in-depth research 
on the Trump administration. She 
said she hoped it would allow the 
community a chance to discuss the 
importance of humility.

“We really wanted someone 

to talk about Trump because it’s 
something that last year has become 
an everyday news topic,” Vander

In an effort to increase 

awareness 
of 
opportunities 

within the communications 
field and to build alumni 
involvement 
with 
students, 

the University of Michigan’s 
Department of Communication 
Studies introduced its career 
exploration series event Friday 
at the Michigan Union.

Communication 

undergraduate 
students 

met 
and 
engaged 
with 

prominent 
alumni 
involved 

in the entertainment media 
industry. They shared their 
experiences for students to 
build future connections and 
understand what is needed to 
be successful.

Margaret 
Mason, 

undergraduate coordinator in 
the Communication Studies 
Department, said this year’s 
goal was to have more events 
and networking opportunities 
for students to attend.

“We strived to have more 

targeted career areas because 
we wanted the students who 
came to be really interested 
in 
the 
information 
being 

presented to them,” Mason 
said. “While this is smaller, 
which is what we expected, I 
think there will be continued 
consistent turnout for future 
events.”

Among 
those 
present 

to speak as panelists were 
Hillary 
Handelsman, 
a 

writer’s assistant for CBS’s 
“Life in Pieces,” and Rachel 
Schloss, a director of brand 

marketing at USA Networks. 
Others included Val Boreland, 
executive 
vice 
president 

of 
content 
strategy 
and 

acquisitions 
entertainment 

networks 
at 
NBCUniversal, 

and 
Alexandra 
Detwiler, 

an 
entertainment 
booking 

producer for NBC News.

Students were offered the 

opportunity to meet panelists 
face to face to ask personal 
questions they might not have 
been able to ask during the 
main event.

Some students, including 

LSA senior Flora Conley, were 
grateful this was included in 
the event.

“As a senior, I believe this 

is a great opportunity to learn 
more about the entertainment 
industry, especially since this 
is a profession I would like 
to get involved in,” Conley 
said. “To meet with alumni 
one on one, learn of their 
perspectives, in addition to 
receiving great advice is very 
helpful.”

In addition to students’ 

individual 
meetings 

with 
panelists, 
Melissa 

Bauernfeind, 
events 
and 

communications 
specialist, 

said 
it 
was 
helpful 
for 

students to hear how some 
panelists struggled to get to 
their current positions.

“I think what they are 

learning, especially if they 
are in the younger years of 
their studies is that they’re 
not quite sure what they want 
to do yet,” Bauernfeind said. 

Mason said this can help 

clear uncertainties looming 
after graduation.

“Most 
students 
do 
not 

have jobs lined up right after 
college,” Mason said. “This 
event showcases if you really 
want to be in a certain area, 
there’s a way to get there if 
you’re willing to work for it.”

IM AGINE DR AGONS

EVAN AARON/Daily

Imagine Dragons performs in Detroit last week.

Broek said. “We wanted someone 
who has done a lot of thinking about 
Trump and humility, or the lack of 
humility, to address the colloquium, 
but we wanted to open it up to the 
public.”

Blow’s presentation highlighted 

Trump’s 
continuous 
dispersion 

of 
false 
information 
to 
the 

public, 
emphasized 
how 
his 

grandiosity contributed to his 
ability to manipulate the public 
and expressed his exasperation 
at Trump’s lack of historical 
understanding. He also said even 
though the media contributed 
to Trump’s victory in the 2016 
election, their role was even more 
important now because of Trump’s 
constant sparring with the truth.

“One of the greatest threats 

we face by the bounty of lying is 
that is corrupts and corrode the 
absoluteness of truth,” Blow said. 
“We now have a president who 
wants absolute control over the 
flow of information and dictate 
his own version of it. Trump is in a 
battle to bend the truth.”

He ended his talk with a 

reminder about the value of the 
truth and how the media and 
public have a duty to continue to 
demand it.

“It may well be that the only 

thing that can protect America 
from its own president is a free 
press and the urgent insistence 
of the public to demand that the 
operation of our customs and the 
concept of accountability are not 
lost,” Blow said.

While much of the audience 

enjoyed 
the 
presentation 
and 

appreciated 
Blow’s 
opinions, 

some noticed the talk was missing 
crucial members of the community.

For instance, LSA freshman 

Julia Mati believed there was not 
much diversity in opinion present 
at the event. Mati explained 
though Blow’s message was well 
received by the audience, it may 
not have been the audience that 
needed to hear what he was saying.

“I agree with what he’s talking 

about, but I feel like people who 
were in there simply because 
they agreed with what he was 
presenting, not because they were 
looking for anything new,” Mati 
said.

Comprehensive studies lecturer 

Marcy Epstein pointed out another 
group that was lacking in numbers: 
the 
undergraduate 
student 

body. She felt the issues Blow 
discussed were relevant, and was 
disappointed the youngest group 
on campus was overshadowed by 
older audience members.

“I found it remarkable for 

the fact that we had an entirely 
packed 
house, 
we 
had 
the 

underrepresentation 
of 
the 

undergraduate body who goes 
here,” Epstein said. “It makes me 
feel that he had excellent things 
to say to an audience who was 
missing.”

On another note, Epstein praised 

Blow for his ability to speak beyond 
the people present at the talk and 
reach a nationwide audience. 

“One of the things I most enjoyed 

was the accessible way in which he 
could move between audiences — 
past the audience that was actually 
in the room — to the audience that 
is the greater American public who 

needs to consider their president 
and how he lies.”

LSA 
freshman 
Giovanna 

Bautista said she was interested in 
what Blow had to say about Trump 
and arrogance, and hoped to learn 
more about the issues at hand.

“The 
political 
climate 
that 

we’ve been in, especially here at 
a college campus, these problems 
aren’t invisible, and it’s something 
that we have to talk about,” 
Bautista said. “It’s an important 
conversation and I really wanted 
to be a part of it.”

Bautista also touched on Blow’s 

opinions on Trump’s attacks on 
minority groups and explained it 
was important for the University 
community to have more open 
conversations about these issues to 
create a more inclusive campus.

“It’s an issue here that everyone 

brings up, but no one has a solid 
answer,” Bautista said. “I do think 
that it begins with very simplistic 
conversations, brutal honesty and 
acknowledging intersectionalities 
and understanding that we all come 
from very different backgrounds. 
We can’t really know what the next 
step is until we start with listening 
to one another and acknowledging 
our differences.”

Vander Broek explained she 

was excited to see that audience 
members were still hopeful to 
create change in the years to come. 
She also praised Blow for his ability 
to encourage underrepresented 
groups to speak their minds.

“I was energized to see people 

thinking about 2020; he represents 
encouragement for getting more 
people to the table whose opinions 
have not been considered before,” 
Vander Broek said.

technology comes out it’s not just 
engineers who help make the 
transition.”

He also added the unique 

approach provided a broader view 
that adds meaning to projected 
impact autonomous vehicles will 
have.

“I think the transition has a lot 

of potential to make transportation 
more energy efficient, not just by 
getting better gas milage or using 
better materials but by changing 
the overall role of the car,” said 
Jankowski.

One 
speaker, 
Kenneth 

Gillingham, 
an 
associate 

professor of economics at Yale 
University, presented his research 
on how Corporate Average Fuel 
Economy standards — which 
are government standards that 
require car companies to have 
fuel economy weighted by sales 
to average 54.5 mpg by 2025 for 
better fuel economy — and how 
they affect vehicle safety.

Contrary to the belief that 

more 
fuel-efficient 
vehicles 

are lighter and therefore more 
dangerous, Gillingham’s research 
found CAFE standards actually 
increased safety on roads because 
vehicle weights became more 
equal — there were fewer big-car-
versus-little-car crashes, which 
are more dangerous.

Gillingham also attested to 

the importance of the conference 
taking 
an 
interdisciplinary 

approach, writing in an email to 
The Daily, “ I had the opportunity 
to speak with stakeholders from 
several 
audiences—academia, 

government 
regulators, 
and 

industry—providing 
useful 

perspectives and feedback for 
further improving the work in 
preparation for submission to a 
journal.”

Researchers 
grappled 
with 

the 
cumbersome 
nature 
of 

transportation data. Even data 
on the cost of vehicles is hard 
to pin down because car prices 
are often haggled down from 
the 
manufacturer’s 
suggested 

retail price. Vehicle attributes 
can be difficult to compare 
directly because of the often-
different problems cars may 
exhibit and their customizable 
nature. Additionally, consumer 
habits change based on many 
factors, such as region and owner 
demographics.

Many presentations and panels 

focused on the topic of subsidies 
for electric vehicles, as well as the 
infrastructure needed for their 
rollout, and political attention 
that 
transforming 
mobility 

systems — like designated lanes 
and charging networks — will 
need.

One panelist, Rod Lache, a 

managing director at Deutsche 
Bank Securities in the autos and 
auto parts sector, was optimistic 
about the onset of autonomous 
technology.

“They’re taking the safety 

driver out of (driverless test) 
vehicles in the next few quarters, 
not years,” he said.

Panelists referred to driverless 

technology being synonymous 
with 
shared 
mobility, 
saying 

personal ownership of vehicles 
may soon be obsolete. Instead, 
the future could look like 
subscribing to a vehicle service 
where people are driven to 
their destinations and the car 
would move on to others. Lache 
added urgency to this principle, 
too, stating: “Shared mobility 
is going to happen a lot sooner 
than people believe.”

More panelists detailed the 

gravity of shared mobility.

“If you think about the elderly, 

they don’t have (mobility),” said 
Neil Schloss, vice president 
and chief financial officer of 

mobility at Ford. He added this 
principle has a broader scope 
than 
convenience, 
saying, 

“Mobility really is a right as we 
go forward.”

TE3 co-chair Ellen Hughes-

Cromwick, a senior economist 
and interim associate director 
of social science and policy 
at the U-M Energy Institute, 
spoke about the work of Fellipe 
Balieiro, a senior consultant 
at IHS Markit, which is a 
London-based 
consulting 

firm that advises companies 
in transportation, energy and 
aerospace matters.

“They have just completed 

a study to look at what the 
dimensions are in terms of 
takeoff of electrified, connected 
and autonomous vehicles, and 
they’ve done studies of each 
of the different markets — 
Asia, Europe, the U.S., Latin 
America, et cetera — and 
what they’re trying to do in 
the study is look at what the 
capacity is for the physical 
production of these units and 
also what kind of regulatory 
and policy framework is being 
developed to either hinder or 
promote the development and 
adoption of these new modes 
of 
transportation.” 
Hughes-

Cromwick said.

Hughes-Cromwick 
also 

spoke more generally about the 
conference’s nature of joining 
the private and public sectors 
with academia.

“Academics and this research 

enterprise 
here 
combined 

with teaching provides a really 
important 
framework 
for 

furthering thought in many 
areas and it’s a very valuable 
and necessary part of any kind 
of analysis that somebody would 
do whether they’re in the private 
sector or government, we rely 
substantially 
on 
academic 

research 
in 
these 
different 

areas.”

ensure instruction includes 
medically accurate sexuality 
education 
that 
is 
age 

appropriate.

State 
Sen. 
Hoon-Yung 

Hopgood, D-Taylor, proposed 
the 
bill. 
The 
proposed 

curriculum seeks to better 
prepare 
adolescents 
to 

become 
sexually 
healthy 

adults.

“Research 
continues 
to 

show that comprehensive sex 
education, which teaches both 
abstinence and contraception, 
is most effective for young 
people. Youth who receive 
this kind of education are 
more likely to initiate sexual 
activity later in life and use 
protection 
correctly 
and 

consistently when they do 
become 
sexually 
active,” 

Hopgood said in a press 
release.

Currently, 
state 
law 

encourages an abstinence-
only 
approach 
to 
sex 

education, which, the press 
release said, has not proved 
to be effective in increasing 
rates of abstinence despite 
$1.5 billion spent during the 
past decade on abstinence-
only programs.

HB 5074: This bill seeks to 

amend the Income Tax Act 
of 1967 to allow for student 
loan tax deductions, which 
reduces the amount of taxable 

income. The bill would permit 
taxpayers to deduct up to 
$5,000 for single filers and 
$10,000 for joint filers.

State 
Rep. 
Abdullah 

Hammoud, 
D-Dearborn, 

proposed 
the 
amendment, 

stating in a press release this 
bill will give some relief to 
students repaying loans.

“The cost of a college 

education 
has 
increased 

exponentially throughout the 
years. In addition to providing 
much-needed tax relief, this 
bill would provide the state a 
tool to help retain our talent 
in a competitive market. In 
today’s economy, talent is the 
number one determinant for 
a major corporation selecting 
Michigan as a place to do 
business,” said Hammoud.

The bill only applies to 

those who attend college, both 
public and private, in the state 
of Michigan.

HB 5082: This bill sets 

the goal of a 25-percent 
improvement in water quality 
by 2025 by amending the 
1994 Natural Resources and 
Environmental 
Protection 

Act, which regulates the use 
of natural resources, permits 
people to hunt and fish and 
controls what is discharged 
into the environment, among 
other things.

State Rep. Robert Kosowski, 

D-Westland, 
proposed 

the 
amendment, 
which 

requires several government 
departments work together to 
reach this goal.

“The 
department, 

the 
Department 
of 

Environmental Quality, the 
Department of Agriculture 
and Rural Development, the 
Department of Health and 
Human Services, the State 
Transportation Department, 
and the Office of the Great 
Lakes shall jointly conduct a 
broad public and stakeholder 
engagement process across this 
state seeking input on how to 
achieve the goal established 
under subsection (1),” the bill 
reads.

The bill makes no specific 

mention of the water quality in 
Flint and improving the city’s 
water.

HB 5085: This bill earmarks 

liquor tax to go to local 
community 
mental 
health 

clinics to combat substance 
abuse. 
Earmarking 
money 

designates it for a specific use.

State Rep. Steve Marino, 

R-Harrison 
Township, 

proposed the bill, saying in a 
press release the taxes would 
address 
serious 
issues 
in 

substance abuse in the state.

“Substance 
abuse 
is 
a 

major problem in Michigan. 
Our local community mental 
health agencies are in the best 
position to identify and develop 
programs to fight the abuse 
of alcohol, opioids and other 
drugs. This bill will deliver 
more resources to agencies on 
the front lines of this fight,” 
Marino said in the press release.

The bill could provide more 

than $17 million each year 
to combat alcohol and opioid 
addictions.

problems faced by Ann Arbor 
immigrants such as creating video

“Ann Arbor is not the same as 

30 years ago. We need to show 
immigrants that you are part of

said. “We need to have classes to

Innovation 
has 
been 
helping 

the

students 
and 

faculty 
solve 
problems 
like 

Al-Lami’s for the past three 
years. 
Formerly 
called 
the 

Office of Digital Education and 
Innovation, the office has evolved 
to solve academic problems with 
technological solutions and with 
new approaches or processes to 
learning.

Elisabeth Gerber, an associate 

dean for research and policy 
engagement and one of the hosts 
of the Traveling Innovation Hour, 
turned to the office when she 
sought to find a way to engage her 
students with public policy using 
simulations.

“The challenge is that people 

disagree. That’s why we have public 
policy, that’s why we have politics,” 
Gerber said. “That situation lends 

extremely well to simulations. 
Students can get a hand on what 
it means to come to an agreement 
with someone even though you 
might disagree.”

Gerber has been developing a 

tool with the Office of Academic 
Innovation 
called 
Policymaker, 

which 
allows 
instructors 
to 

“experience strategy development, 
collaboration, 
advocacy, 
and 

communication,” according to the 
tool’s website.

Michael 
Bloom, 
a 
clinical 

assistant professor of law and the 
other host of Traveling Innovation 
Hour, also used the office to develop 
a tool called Praktio. According to 
its website, Praktio utilizes games 
and repetitions to “provide instant 
feedback and explanation” when 
learning about contracts.

As Facebook reported, within 

24 
hours 
of 
its 
resurfacing, 

#MeToo has started appearing on 
the social media feeds of nearly 
everyone in the nation, with 
approximately 4.7 million people 
posting, commenting and reacting 
over 12 million times. This range 
of visibility is reaching the breadth 
of even the most successful social 
media 
movements, 
including 

the 
similar 
#YesAllWomen, 

which gave women a space to 
discuss instances of misogyny 
and violence. #YesAllWomen has 
produced over a million tweets 
on its thread since beginning in 
2014, and #MeToo has quickly 
accumulated similar attention in 
only a few weeks.

Even further, this movement 

has sparked conversations among 
all generations. As an Editorial 
Board, we noticed posts not only 
from our college-aged peers, 
but also from those we know in 
generations above us, like our 
parents and former teachers. 
Seeing attention being given to 
#MeToo by all generations frames 
the issue in context: Sexual 
harassment and assault has 
affected, and still affects, people 
of all ages. And, by talking about 
the problem, we are giving it 
much-needed 
attention 
and 

providing crucial support for 
survivors.

#MeToo has been so successful 

in part because it allows people to 
recount their stories in a manner 
that necessitates very little detail. 
Experiencing sexual misconduct is 
traumatizing, and having to relive 
these moments can be very painful. 
Furthermore, the sheer volume of 
#MeToo posts provides survivors 
with a space where they know they 
are not alone in their experiences. 
In this sphere, survivors know that 
they are understood, supported 
and, most importantly, believed, 
because they see that there 
are so many others who have 
experienced 
similar 
traumas. 

Survivors can support one another 
and remind each other that they’re 
not alone. It is difficult to talk 
about sexual harassment and 
assault, but survivors feel more 
comfortable among others who 
truly understand.

Though #MeToo began to 

gain attention due to the recent 
Harvey Weinstein scandal, it has 
persisted as a strong movement 
because of the thousands of 
survivors who saw it as a good 
platform 
to 
discuss 
sexual 

misconduct. In the media, these 
issues can be presented with 
“storybook villains” like Harvey 
Weinstein — painting a picture 
of sexual assaults as isolated 
instances. Often, discussions of 
sexual assault concerning public 
figures are easier to rally around 
than instances of assault that 

involve everyday people in our 
lives who are not in the public eye. 
While it’s easy to rally against 
someone whom we do not have 
personal connection to, we must 
remember most perpetrators are 
not famous figures; rather, they 
can be anyone, perhaps even 
people we are close to.

It’s 
important 
we 
stand 

by and believe survivors of 
sexual assault and harassment 
regardless of the fame of the 
perpetrator. This is especially 
important 
considering 
only 

310 out of every 1,000 people 
who have experienced sexual 
assault report it to the police, 
illustrating the silence that 
is associated with assault in 
our society. #MeToo brings 
attention to, and solidarity with, 
those who have experienced 
assault and is a step toward 
breaking this silence.

#MeToo is a strong reminder 

that survivors are everywhere, 
and we must listen, understand 
and believe them. As an editorial 
board, we agree that sexual 
harassment and assault won’t end 
through a social media movement, 
but #MeToo is an important 
step in educating the public on 
the magnitude and effect of this 
issue. #MeToo provides a space 
for solidarity among survivors and 
sparks a conversation that we all 
need to be a part of.

B

lest are they / the poor 
in spirit / theirs is the 
kingdom 
of 
God.” 
I 

remember singing this line from 
Hymn #624 during Mass many 
times in my youth, and I continue 
to sing it when I am in St. Mary’s 
Student Parish. I am not one to 
quote Bible verses, so do not see 
this as proselytizing Catholicism. 
(In fact, this might be the first 
time I have ever done so publicly.) 
Nevertheless, it has been the 
verse that runs through my head 
when I ponder debate, protest and 
morality in this modern age. 

This 
past 
week, 
Charles 

Murray, a fellow at the American 
Enterprise 
Institute 
and 
the 

co-author of the “The Bell Curve,” 
came to the University of Michigan 
campus. People protested because 
of his highly debatable scientific 
rhetoric on IQ and race, where 
he claims that whites are simply 
intellectually 
superior. 
After 

passing by the event Wednesday 
evening and recalling the recent 
rise of racist incidents in the Ann 
Arbor community, I found myself 
thinking about debate and protest 
in a broader sense. Recognize that 
I am not questioning whether 
protesting 
such 
speeches 
is 

important, but rather asking how 
one protests illogical conclusions. 
As a logical person, how does one 
use rationale to overcome illogic? 
More importantly, how does one 
debate individuals such as Charles 
Murray for an “improved societal 
morality,” however ambiguous 
that might be?

Has the debate on morality 

— or lack thereof — added to the 
gridlock and divide we see today in 
the United States?

I previously wrote that my 

Catholic 
education, 
though 

somewhat 
divisive 
in 
today’s 

more 
secular 
society, 
was 

beneficial because it increased 
existential thought and improved 
introspection. 
I 
neglected 
to 

mention that as a result of this 
education, I have come to question 
morality more consciously, on 
which, I would argue, most of 
the faith is based. My biggest 
struggle as a Catholic is that I am 
constantly questioning the words 
in the Bible, and how they pertain 

to today’s moral standings. In this 
vein, I posit that most morality 
is based on faith — which, in my 
own definition, means suspending 
rationale in support of something 
that 
cannot 
be 
conclusively 

determined.

Therefore, when we attempt 

to 
engage 
with 
people 
like 

Charles Murray and other white 
supremacists, I am conflicted, as I 
might be in faith, on whether these 
individuals have morals. Just as my 
logical, “atheist” brain might say, 
“Their conclusions are unfounded; 
therefore, their pseudo-science 
is not worth engaging in.” But 
believing they have morals, I 
say in the same breath: “These 
influencers are not going away. 
These individuals have devout 
followers and advocates. Though 
they have not shown actions 
in the past which might yield a 
sense of morality, we must engage 
with them, sit down, try to ask 
how and why they came to such 
conclusions. We must believe they 
can change their ideas.”

So as to think about these 

opposing views, I would start by 
reasoning that protests in general 
lie on the fact that we find the 
person or group to be wrong: 
logically and, more frequently 
today, ethically. However, I also 
think that if we are motivated to 
change the mind of the opponent, 
we must begin to think about our 
own sense of morality.

Through some of my own 

introspection, I have realized that 
a large issue in our country is a 
“debate crisis.” One of my biggest 
questions is if humans possess 
an innate moral compass that is 
neurologically written into our 
genes and brain makeup. I think 
this “debate crisis” lies in the fact 
that our views on morality have 
shifted, without much notice, from 
a place of constant question in 
“average” society to subconscious 
definiteness. 

In other words, we have come to 

believe there is a rather subjective, 
but firm line of morality, and either 
you exist on the “good” side of 
that line or you do not. In popular 
society, I find people see very little 
gray area in this. As a consequence, 
people more frequently blame large 

and small issues not on poor logical 
conclusions, but rather a severe 
lack of moral reasoning. Moreover, 
our 
hyper-individualistic 

population has increasingly begun 
to define morality by one’s own 
standards. Though not a defined 
fact of nature, we have come to 
subconsciously declare that since 
you and I are human, we must 
have a sound moral compass.

Therefore, when we engage in 

the increasingly partisan politics 
of the modern era, regardless 
of what political leanings we 
might have, we individually deem 
ourselves morally superior. Since a 
sense of morality is fundamental to 
the justice and progress of society, 
some call those opposing us on 
a variety of different viewpoints 
illogical, corrupt and beyond 
reach. This is highly problematic 
since we have, without even 
realizing, declared there are no 
grounds to question and engage a 
viewpoint, nor do we wish to delve 
into why morally questionable 
rationales exist.

I 
completely 
understand 

and 
agree 
that 
people 
like 

Charles 
Murray 
and 
other 

white supremacists are morally 
problematic. There’s little debate 
there. And honestly, I don’t know 
the complete answer to debating 
morally 
questionable 
people. 

However, may I suggest the 
problem partially lies in that we 
don’t recognize such speakers and 
supremacists most likely believe 
they are morally superior, just as 
you and I might find ourselves to 
be morally superior. 

Call me optimistic, but pure 

logic must win when talking and 
engaging with individuals such as 
Charles Murray, simply because 
it has for millennia. In addition, 
I doubt that they are void of 
changing their perspectives. Are 
they “poor in spirit?” Certainly. Is 
“theirs the kingdom of God?” I’m 
not sure. However, by “graying” 
morality in our modern society, not 
ignoring why they came to their 
perspective and asking them to 
look inside themselves, hopefully, 
change will happen.

A

ctually, I don’t believe in 
God.” After three and a 
half years, the words still 

feel alien as they leave my mouth.

When people ask me about 

my background, I tell them I was 
“raised Catholic.” The Church 
has always been a defining 
feature of my life: I was baptized 
as a newborn, and I learned 
about the love of Jesus and Mary 
every week at Sunday school as a 
preteen. From ages 11 to 18, I went 
to Catholic school. Every day for 
seven years I attended religion 
class, prayed along with the 
school announcements and was 
surrounded by other Christians.

This experience shaped me 

to an extent I may never fully 
understand. The Catholic Church 
gave me my morals, my ethics, my 
sense of community, my desire 
to positively affect the world. I 
will forever respect the amazing 
people within the Church and 
the good they do, but I can’t call 
myself a Catholic anymore.

About my sophomore year of 

high school, my questions started 
outpacing the Church’s answers. 
The more I learned about science 
and the world around me, the 
more contradictions I saw within 
my religion. The Church asks 
believers to have faith, to embrace 
God’s mysteries. But why would 
God create the most intelligent, 
infinitely inquisitive creatures in 
the history of the planet, only to 
tell them that faith is enough? How 
could a single sin of Adam and Eve 
condemn all human posterity to 
suffer and die? Eventually, the 
lack of answers became too much. 
I finally acknowledged I didn’t 
believe during my senior year of 
high school.

I identify as agnostic: I accept 

I may never know if God exists. 
I bristle at the label atheist. I 
feel quite sure that no bearded 
Abrahamic All-Father guides the 
universe from above the clouds, 
but who’s to say no cosmic force 
exists at all? However, sometimes 
I think my aversion to atheism 
runs deeper than uncertainty. 
I grew up feeling connected 
to an ancient, global, spiritual 
community. Atheism feels so 

final, like cutting the last cord to a 
community I used to cherish. It’s 
a deep dive into the unknown.

I know I’m not the only one 

who has struggled with leaving 
religion. A third of Americans 
under 30 have no religion, and the 
number of religiously unaffiliated 
Americans has only grown in 
recent years. A great deal of 
physical and emotional strain 
has accompanied this growth in 
deconversion. Studies have shown 
that the religiously unaffiliated 
report worse physical health, 
more suicidal thoughts and less 
healthy behaviors. Psychologist 
Marlene Winell has even coined 
the term RTS, or religious trauma 
syndrome, to describe the negative 
health effects some undergo when 
losing their religion. 

I can understand why losing 

religion 
may 
be 
traumatic. 

For many, religion ensures a 
strong sense of community, an 
unshakeable sense of purpose 
and 
an 
assurance 
that 
all 

the struggles of this life will 
eventually dissolve into eternal 
joy in the afterlife. Who wouldn’t 
be devastated after losing these 
lifelong safety nets?

Although leaving Catholicism 

didn’t leave me with RTS, it did 
leave me with a bit of a void. I 
questioned my purpose in life, 
my moral system, my sense of 
community. 
Could 
I 
believe 

in 
Christian 
values 
without 

believing in Christ? Why be good? 
What’s the point of even living 
if it all ends? I sometimes found 
myself wishing I could force 
myself to believe, that I could 
turn off the part of my brain that 
never stops asking questions.

It took a while, but I came to 

cherish the freedom and joyful 
cognizance irreligion can bring. 
Losing my religion allowed me to 
live in the present. Catholicism 
perpetually trapped me outside 
the current moment. I was always 
preoccupied with either the past 
or future. The past held all the 
answers: the revelations of the 
prophets, the teachings of Christ, 
the sins of my ancestors that have 
been passed down to me — these 
all occurred thousands of years 

ago. The future was the only thing 
worth living for. All good deeds 
were done in preparation for an 
afterlife or out of love for God and 
his kingdom to come in the distant 
future.

I came to realize that the idea of 

a world without God may be more 
ecstatic and beautifully absurd 
than I could have imagined. How 
impossibly fortunate are we that 
the trillions of atoms that make up 
our bodies randomly combined in 
just the right cosmic combination 
that allows us to see and feel a 
sunrise, to taste ice cream on a 
warm summer night, to see art 
and to hear music? I’ve learned to 
find gratitude for the absurd fact 
that I’m alive at all, rather than 
despair at the idea of death.

I’ve also learned to find more joy 

and meaning in my relationships. 
I live for my friends and family 
rather than the idea of God. I live 
for the love of those around me 
and appreciate conversations and 
memorable nights as I’m having 
them. I feel free to do good deeds 
for others not out of fear of sin or 
respect for moral authority, but 
because I cherish the people in my 
life and want to help them.

I learned to find meaning in 

my everyday work. Catholicism 
teaches the idea of a vocation — 
a calling from God to a certain 
career or role in life. I’ve embraced 
the idea of a secular vocation, 
the idea that I can craft my own 
meaning 
by 
making 
positive 

impacts in my school life, in my 
career and in my everyday actions. 
I’ve focused on building a career in 
which I can benefit my community 
through 
practicing 
law 
and 

improving government policies. 
I’m trying to find purpose in the 
small accomplishments and day-
to-day victories.

I’m not saying I’ve reached 

enlightenment. Far from it — 
most of the time I have no idea 
what I’m doing. But, I’m learning. 
I’m learning to live without easy 
answers and hope in a higher 
power. It’s not easy, but I’m 
learning.

The importance of #MeToo

M

eToo has been tweeted over 800,000 times since Alyssa Milano 
brought it to the forefront of Twitter in the wake of the Harvey 
Weinstein sexual assault allegations. This movement originated 

with activist Tarana Burke over 10 years ago through her foundation Just 
Be Inc., with the aim of raising awareness of the magnitude of sexual 
assault. This gives survivors a community of support, and the reach of 
a social media campaign that has the ability to flood people’s timelines 
can effectively demonstrate the extent of the issue. The Michigan Daily 
Editorial Board believes that #MeToo functions as a strong solidarity 
movement, and though this campaign will not solve the serious problem 
of sexual assault, it is a reminder to be supportive of all survivors.

Mac Demarco performed at Hill Saturday night
Mac DeMarco is one of us

The singer gave a solo performnce at Hill this past Saturday night

Let’s just start with one very 

true statement: Mac DeMarco 
is a man for and of the people. At 
Hill Auditorium this Saturday, he 
walked onto the stage in his classic 
getup: A red t shirt, stonewashed 
vintage jeans and, of course, his 
trademark baseball cap. Watching 
DeMarco greet the audience was 
almost like seeing a good friend 
on the sidewalk after years of 
separation. There’s just something 
about the guy that soothes your 
soul, whether it be his warm 
friendliness 
or 
his 
smooth, 

virtually perfect singing voice.

This show was even more 

intimate 
than 
others; 
he 

performed sans band, armed only 
with an acoustic guitar and his 
goofy wit. “You may ask,” he said 
to the excited crowd, “Where’s the 
band?” The audience erupted into 
laughter, for what would certainly 
not be the last time during his 
hour-long set. While other artists 
may have been lackluster with 
such a minimal set-up, DeMarco’s 
inviting personality and huge 
stage presence made up for it 
tenfold. It became clear in the 
first minutes of his performance 
that the show wasn’t just about 
the music: It was a conversation 
between the musician and the 
audience, so comfortable it felt like 
the crowd was sitting on his living 
room couch. “Make yourselves 

comfortable,” Demarco offered all 
who sat in the auditorium, “enjoy 
this, be respectful, love each 
other.” That said, he continued 
into a show that could easily be 
deemed “legendary” by anyone 
who sat in Hill Saturday night.

DeMarco brought the house 

down song after song, playing 
old and new tunes alike, often 
relying 
on 
committed 
front-

row fans to feed him some of his 
earlier lyrics. It was clear that 
the audience felt at home, as 
they crooned out favorites like 
“Salad Days,” “Let Her Go” and 
“Ode to Viceroy,” with every 
lyric obviously loved. DeMarco’s 

solo 
guitar 
accompaniment 

allowed his crystal-clear voice 
to shine through, only enhanced 
by 
the 
auditorium’s 
world-

class acoustics. It was almost 
unbelievable to watch DeMarco 
stand there alone and knock 
out every song with impeccable 
showmanship; 
every 
note 

soared, and the crowd ate it up in 
amazement and admiration.

DeMarco made jokes about the 

Jamaican Jerk Pit (“I tell ya, the 
hot sauce: bellísima”), and Nirvana 
at the Blind Pig, playing to the Ann 
Arbor audience with a laugh at 
every turn. Crowd requests like 
“My Kind of Woman” and “Let 
My Baby Stay” echoed warmly 
through the venue, as hundreds 
of crowd members sung with him, 
turning each acoustic song into 
a fully fleshed out experience. 
As the show came to a close, 
DeMarco dedicated the last song 
to his girlfriend in L.A., and began 
to sing “Together,” making it 
easily the most touching tune of 
the night. The audience supported 
him in each word, as he began an 
encore solely based on their “la’s” 
and organized people closer and 
closer together. As voices filled the 
venue, DeMarco did what could 
only be the best show closer of all 
time: The man crowdsurfed. As 
Demarco’s joyful spirit meshed 
with the youth of his audience, 
the often classical Hill Auditorium 
morphed into something different 
for the night: A place for genuine 
fun. 

THE CW

‘Riverdale’ is the best show on television
‘Riverdale’ is absurdly 
engaging in new season

The hit TV show returns for another thrilling, shocking season

Fake blood either awards 

authenticity 
or 
warrants 

mockery. There is something 
about the believability of fake 
blood in TV shows that makes 
it corny or passable. Archie 
Andrews (K.J. Apa, “A Dog’s 
Purpose”), however, looks like 
he rolled around in some red 
paint and called it a day. I mean, 
it wasn’t even close to the right 
color.

This is how the season two 

premiere of “Riverdale” starts, 
and the ridiculousness of the 
show 
manages 
to 
maintain 

amusement throughout the rest 
of the episode.

Originally, the mystery that 

plagued the small town of 
Riverdale was who killed Jason 
Blossom (Trevor Stines, “The 
Fosters”). Now that the murder 
has been solved (spoiler — he 
was killed by his own father) 
the show must shift to a new 
plot and new set of riddles to 
unravel. The new focus appears 
to center around Fred Andrews 
(Luke Perry, “Body of Proof”): 
Why was he shot in the local 
diner, and by whom?

The focal point of this episode 

is Fred’s condition. There are 
many questions swarming in the 
viewer’s mind, but the concern 
is distracted from Fred’s life 
because of Archie’s clothes. 
They are a huge sore spot in 
the middle of the content of the 
episode. The clothes are covered 
in unrealistic blood (from his 
father’s wound), and in today’s 

market, with all the resources 
special 
effects 
offer, 
there 

should be no reason the blood 
is so unbelievable. Then, he 
doesn’t even bother to change 
out of once he returns home. I’m 
not sure what angle they were 
going for there — maybe, “My 
dad is dying, so staying in my 
bloody clothes will surely help.” 
Whatever the questionable logic 
may be, the phony blood seems 
to take up about 60 percent of 
the screen time.

There are many predictable 

side 
effects 
to 
TV 
shows 

broadcasting the improbable, 

like Veronica’s (Camila Mendes, 
“The New Romantics”) perfectly 
dry hair and untouched smokey 
eye after a steamy shower scene 
with Archie. I can get over that. 
It happens in basically every TV 
show and movie ever made. But 
I cannot seem to wrap my brain 
around 15 and 16-year-old high 
school students wearing five-
inch stiletto heels everywhere, 
including the hospital. Or that 
two teenagers can easily waltz 
into the scene of a crime, as 
Becky (Lili Reinhart, The Good 
Neighbor) and Jughead (Cole 

Sprouse, “The Suite Life on 
Deck”) do at the diner, without 
any caution tape or police 
officers in sight. Glamorization 
in Hollywood is expected, until 
it becomes so unrelatable that 
it forces me to lose interest in 
the show, which is exactly what 
“Riverdale” risks by continuing 
to incorporate far-fetched ideas 
of norms.

The plot complicates with 

many moving parts. At one 
end, 
Becky 
and 
Jughead 

have to face the reality of 
their relationship under Mrs. 
Cooper’s 
(Mädchen 
Amick, 

“Twin 
Peaks”) 
disapproving 

eye. Jughead struggles with his 
father’s imprisonment. Veronica 
accuses her mother of putting 
a hit on Fred. Cheryl’s mother 
suffered serious third degree 
burns as a result of the fire she 
started and is now in intensive 
care. Archie is plagued with 
the memory of the shooter and 
is distraught over his father’s 
condition. All of these subplots 
come across forced, arguably 
more so than the first season. 
The constant “looming danger” 
is exhausting to keep up with, 
and it’s as though the producers 
are jam packing all of these 
twisted plots into one episode, 
and it just doesn’t fit. Actually, it 
makes the show convoluted and 
rather unconvincing.

Fred Andrews unsurprisingly 

wakes up, but the heartfelt 
moment is inevitably ruined 
by the tacky and laughable 
dialogue. 
The 
fatherly 
love 

Fred feels for Archie isn’t 
appreciated in that moment — 
it loses all credibility because 
the writers wrote it in such a

CONCERT REVIEW

TV REVIEW

way that no genuine person 
would ever say. Mr. Andrew’s 
claim that he “came back” for 
his son is typical and cliche, and 
Perry’s delivery of the line was 
subpar at best. Not to mention 
Archie’s newfound duty to sit 
on the stairs of his home with a 
baseball bat every night in case 
the ski mask shooter comes back 
— really?

The one thing this episode 

did well was offer closure on 
two accounts. First, we finally 
got to see the elusive Mr. Lodge 
(Mark Consuelos, “The Night 
Shift”). The drama in that scene 
was justified, as his arrival was 
long awaited and anticipated. 
Mr. Lodge sits in the back of the 
room, rather Godfather-esche, 

with little lighting on his face 
so he is unrecognizable. Instead 
of a happy reunion between 
father and daughter, the scene 

is tense and uneasy. The second 
is the answer to what happened 
to the creepy music teacher, 
Ms. 
Grundy 
(Sarah 
Habel, 

“Atomica”). 
Episodes 
ago, 

Ms. Grundy had an extremely 
inappropriate relationship with 
Archie that was glossed over 
because attention centered on 
Jason. She simply disappeared 
and was never mentioned again. 
However, the final scene of this 
episode — and cliffhanger — 
reveals Ms. Grundy’s murder by 
no other that the man in the ski 
mask.

Although this show has it’s 

fair share of aspects to poke fun 
at, it ironically keeps viewers 
engaged. Mystery hooks people, 
and “Riverdale” has proven to 
capture a large-scale audience. 
While its acting is weak and 
lines are corny, the desire to 
know whodunit keeps viewers 
sticking around.

Watching 
the 
popularity 

of The Front Bottoms rocket 
over the past year has been 
downright jarring for me to 
watch. A band marked by 
their quirky and warm lyrical 
stylings, they were the last 
group I expected to end up 
opening for massively popular 
bands like Brand New and 
blink-182 when I discovered 
them nearly six years ago. I 
say this not out of malice, but 
rather because they felt like 
such a niche secret deeply 
nestled into my adolescent 
music taste. Now as a junior 
in college, I’ve seen The Front 
Bottoms grow from playing 

club shows to massive music 
festivals with thousands of 
people singing along.

Last 
Thursday, 
The 

Michigan Daily spoke with lead 
singer and songwriter Brian 
Sella about the band’s newest 
record, Going Grey, and their 
current headlining tour with 
diverse support from the UK’s 
best punk rockers in Basement 
and beautiful ambient indie 
rock from Bad Bad Hats.

The Michigan Daily: To 

start off, could you tell me a 
little bit about your experience 
with watching your crowds 
and fan base grow as you’ve 
transitioned 
from 
playing 

clubs 
to 
theaters, 
festival 

stages and opening for bands 
like blink-182?

Sella: 
Yeah, 
absolutely, 

it’s been incredible. It’s been 
sort of a slow build. It’s been 
easy kind of to adjust to. You 
know, you always get nervous, 
but like you said, we played in 
basements, in small clubs, in 
small bars. And then it was like 
we’d play those same stops for 
like years, years at a time, like 
four or five years. And when 
we first started playing them 
there would literally be one 
to 10 people there. And by the 
time we put out more material 
and came back a few times, all 
of a sudden there’d be a few 
hundred people. That kind of 
just feels great, you know, to 
make an art project and then 
go out and play it for people 

and have people appreciate it 
and respect it enough to like 
come out and take their time 
to enjoy themselves at a show. 
And now we’re playing today at 
the House of Blues in Boston, 
Massachusetts, and I think it’s 
a sold out show. It’s just like a 
total trip. I feel so lucky to be 
able to do it… it’s really insane. 
It’s sort of hard to explain, 
but it’s a very nice feeling. It 
feels very positive, and I feel 
very lucky that it’s grown to 
the level that it’s at. And it’s 
not like a ridiculous level, you 
know, it’s not like thousands 
and 
thousands 
of 
people 

coming to see us play. So, it’s 
nice, you know, it’s a nice sort 
of, it’s a good vibe still.

TMD: Are there any songs 

you’re excited to play live?

Sella: We’re going to open 

the set with the first song on 
the new album, “You Used 
to Say,” and we’re going to 
close the set with the last 
song (“Ocean”) on the new 
album, so I’m very excited to 
be able to sandwich the set. 
And in between that we’re 
going to play 20 songs from all 
the albums. I’m excited to do 
“Ocean,” “Holy Fuck” and then 
also I’m very excited to play 
“Grand Finale,” because it’s 
going to sound very big, and 
it’s going to fill up the room. 
So, I’m definitely excited about 
playing those.

TMD: 
Going 
off 
of 

bookending your sets, I noticed 
Going Grey is bookended with 
coastal sounds like waves and 
birds. Is there any overarching 
narrative or theme to the album 
that you feel isn’t immediately 
obvious?

Sella: I feel like it is pretty 

immediately obvious. I thought 
it was pretty punk rock to have 
a very long, sort of cinematic 
intro to the album. Basically 
the idea with that was like the 
themes of vacation: “Vacation 
Town” that whole idea… and 
how it ends with the song 
“Ocean.” So that was kind of 
the idea behind that, to do like a 
cinematic, kind of book end the 
front and back of the album. If 
you play it on a loop, it’ll sync 
up perfectly so it’ll be a perfect 
loop around. Also, the song 
“Vacation Town” has a little 
weird intro that if you play 
that song on loop it’s a perfect 
circle. You won’t be able to tell 
where the start and end is. So it 
was kind of just an artistic idea 
that I think kind of added a lot 
to the atmosphere of the album 
and kind of puts you in that 
mindset when you hear those 
seagulls squawk, and you can 
kind of like paint the picture 
in your own mind. That’s how 
you can listen to the album as 
an individual.

TMD: Were your goals for 

this album different than your 
first release (Back On Top) on 
Fueled By Ramen?

Sella: You know, I never 

really know what the album 
is going to sound like when I 
start recording it. So it’s sort of 
hard to have a vision or goals. 
I think I just wanted to keep 
expanding. I wanted to develop 
naturally. I didn’t want to force 
anything, and I wanted to make 
songs that we could come out 
and play live. That’s the most 
important part. That’s really 
the most important expression 
is playing it live. And I think 
that we did that.

TMD: Did you have any 

influences while writing Going 
Grey?

Sella: I listen to a lot of 

radio, like kind of top 40 radio. 
Some old school pop music. I 
was trying to make a modern 

pop album to be honest. That 
was kind of like the vibe and 
inspiration I was going for. 
The way we were recording 
it was in three day sessions. 
So that was kind of the most 
comfortable type of music 
to make. It was just kind of 
like fun and relaxed. It was 
good, and I liked it. I keep the 
lyrics freaky, that’s kind of my 
signature thing, but that’s kind 
of how it went.

TMD: To close out, if you 

could can you describe a 
Front Bottoms performance to 
someone who has never seen 
your band before?

Sella: I would say fun, and 

I would say loose. I think 
that 
nowadays 
with 
live 

performance, because a lot of 
people are using tracks, and a 
lot of “bands” quote-unquote, 
you know they’re not — it 
doesn’t seem like they’re really 
up there, whatever, having a 
good time. For us, when we 
get up on stage, we’re straight 
up. We’re up there. We might 
as well be in the audience, 
because that’s kind of the loose 
style that we have. If the song’s 
not going good, I’ll stop the 
song, and we’ll play a different 
one. It’s just very loose overall. 
We want to have fun. We want 
to have as much fun as the 
people in the audience. That’s 
the atmosphere that we try to 
create.

‘The Snowman’ did not experience box office success
‘Snowman’ disappoints in 
nearly every way & shape

New horror film fails to captivate the audience, melts in shame

If you’ve ever been in an 

airport convenience store then 
you’re probably familiar with 
the brand of Scandinavian 
crime-noir 
bestsellers 
from 

authors such as Stieg Larsson 
and Jo Nesbø. Adapted from 
Nesbø’s novel of the same 
name, 
Tomas 
Alfredson’s 

(“Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy”) 
“The 
Snowman” 
follows 

the 
unfortunately 
named 

Inspector Harry Hole as he 
chases a body-dismembering, 
snowman-building 
serial 

killer. At first glance, “The 
Snowman” has all the makings 
of a crime-thriller blockbuster; 
its cast is laden with talent, 
including Michael Fassbender 
(“12 
Years 
A 
Slave”) 
and 

J.K. Simmons (“Whiplash”). 
The source material is an 
international bestseller, and 
director 
Tomas 
Alfredson 

has proven capable on past 
projects. The result, however, 
is a two hour long mess that 
stumbles haphazardly through 
its story while managing to 
remain as turgid and lifeless as 
the icy landscapes it portrays.

The film’s cardinal sin is 

its dialogue and character 
interactions, 
which 
are 

uncomfortable 
and 
clunky. 

Fassbender 
plays 
Harry 

Hole, a grizzled, rules-averse 
detective 
with 
a 
penchant 

for sleeping on the ground in 
public and generally behaving 
like no other person in the 
history of the human race. 
In one particularly laughable 
scene, the solemn and stoic 
Inspector Hole walks to his 
ex-girlfriend’s place of work 
so he can stand outside her 
window and … stare at her? 
In another, a Bergen detective 
played by Val Kilmer (“Top 
Gun”) stares silently at a 

murder 
witness 
while 
she 

recounts 
her 
story. 
When 

Kilmer does reply, his voice has 
been dubbed over and the audio 
doesn’t quite match his lips. 
Just about every interaction in 
“The Snowman” is coated in a 
thick layer of awkward — and 
the cast, for all its raw talent, is 
unable to salvage the film.

If this weren’t enough, the 

story is a tangled mess of red 
herrings, loose ends and utter 
nonsense. The pacing feels 
as if there were 
entire scenes cut 
out from the film, 
which 
Anderson 

confirmed 
— 

nearly 10 to 15 
percent 
of 
the 

script was never 
filmed. 
This 

is 
made 
even 

stranger by the 
fact that much of 
what is present 
feels 
completely 

non-essential 
— most of the 
film is just people talking 
and 
Michael 
Fassbender 

trudging sulkily around Oslo. 
The actual “action” scenes 
are 
frustratingly 
deja-vu 

inducing as several women 
are marked for death with 
omens that, no matter how 
starkly portrayed, are more 
laughable than scary. These 
include building a snowman 
outside a victim’s house, or 
throwing a snowball at her 
as she walks home. The film 
seems unable to consistently 
follow its own story, often 
introducing characters only to 
have them never appear again, 
or having Harry Hole recieve 
cryptic riddles from the killer 
that are never solved. The film 
repeatedly 
makes 
massive 

jumps in logic and reason, 
leaving its audience in the dust.

Perhaps the only thing that 

can be said in favor of “The 

Snowman” is that it has one 
or two visually compelling 
moments, however even these 
feel stylistically out of place. 
The opening sequence features 
a chase scene with side shots 
of cars crossing a bridge that 
feels as if it were ripped from 
a Wes Anderson film. Later 
in the film, a conversation 
is shot from the outside of a 
moving train. Scenes like this, 
while 
impressive 
on 
their 

own, feel less like valuable 

additions to the 
film and more like 
reminders 
that 

cinematographer 
Dion Beebe (“Edge 
of 
Tomorrow”) 

would 
rather 

be 
working 
on 

something 
else. 

These scenes seem 
to jump out of the 
texture of a film 
that is otherwise 
visually 
bland. 

While there are 
occasionally 

pleasant shots of Norway’s 
fjords 
and 
mountains, 
the 

majority of the film is bogged 
down in a version of Oslo 
plagued by an omnipresent 
color palette consisting almost 
entirely of white and gray.

At 
its 
conclusion, 
“The 

Snowman” sees Harry Hole 
back on the Oslo police force, 
volunteering to take up a case 
that some poor, misguided 
producer likely hoped would 
turn into a sequel. Fortunately, 
the 
film’s 
underwhelming 

box office performance of $10 
million worldwide means that 
this is likely the last viewers 
will see of Fassbender’s Harry 
Hole; a fate that is decidedly 
for the best. Tomas Anderson’s 
perfect storm of disastrous 
storytelling and writing will 
at best be remembered as 
“hilariously bad.”

All week, Michigan’s vaunted 

defense was billed as a potential 
roadblock for one of the nation’s 
most electric players. 

Barkley stomped all over that 

notion on the second play from 
scrimmage.

On a play where he and 

Penn State quarterback Trace 
McSorley swapped spots in 
the backfield, Barkley made it 
clear the Wolverines wouldn’t 
dictate 
the 
terms 
Saturday 

night. He ran it right at them — 
and then blew right past them 
for a tone-setting touchdown in 
the Nittany Lions’ 42-13 win in 
Happy Valley. The loss dashed 

any realistic Big Ten title hopes 
for Michigan and closed the 
curtain on any pretense that 
2017 wouldn’t be a rebuilding 
year.

“They made the big plays,” 

said Wolverines’ quarterback 
John O’Korn, “and we didn’t.”

Michigan’s 
top-ranked 

defense 
entered 
Saturday 

having shut down any and 
all comers. But none of those 
teams had McSorley or Barkley. 

Before 
Saturday, 
the 

Wolverines allowed an average 
of 85.8 rushing yards per game. 
It took Barkley three carries to 
eclipse that. 

Michigan entered the game 

with 
the 
nation’s 
second-

ranked 
passing 
defense. 

McSorley threw for 282 yards 
and one touchdown, while also 
rushing for 76 yards and three 
more scores.

The two were dangerous on 

their own. McSorley hit tight 
windows all night, exposing 
Michigan’s secondary for the 
first time all year. Barkley 
was 
simply 
unstoppable, 

averaging over seven yards per 
carry while leaving defenders 
grasping at air.

The 
Wolverines 
had 
no 

answer when the two worked 
in 
tandem, 
either. 
On 
the 

second drive, McSorley drew a 
defender in before pitching the 
ball to Barkley, who waltzed 
in for a score. Later, in the 
third quarter, McSorley saw a 
linebacker isolated in coverage 
and lofted a ball down the 
sideline into Barkley’s hands 
for a 42-yard touchdown.

“I 
thought 
their 
offense 

played extremely well — (that’s 
an) 
understatement,” 
said 

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
“They were hitting on all 
cylinders. Their back (Barkley) 

is really good, as advertised, 
and the quarterback, McSorley, 
played 
extremely 
well. 

Quarterback 
was 
hot 
and 

receivers made plays downfield. 
It was impressive.”

There was a slight glimmer 

of hope in the second quarter, 
when sophomore cornerback 
David 
Long 
intercepted 
an 

errant McSorley pass. Michigan 
drove down the field, capping 
off an impressive 59-yard drive 
with a one-yard touchdown 
from 
running 
back 
Karan 

Higdon on 4th-and-goal.

Two 
possessions 
later, 

running back Ty Isaac followed 
his blockers into the endzone, 
cutting Penn State’s lead to one 
point and temporarily quieting 
the home crowd.

The 
Wolverines 
wouldn’t 

score again.

Led by McSorley, Penn State 

put together an impressive 

response. A well-placed throw 
to DaeSean Hamilton picked up 
36 yards. A back-shoulder fade 
to Gesicki gained 17. And then 
McSorley kept it himself and 
ran in unscathed for a three-
yard touchdown that stretched 
the lead back to eight entering 
halftime.

As the Nittany Lions picked 

up steam, Michigan’s offense 
ran out of gas. Dropped passes, 
missed blocking assignments 
and 
poorly-timed 
penalties 

ended several promising drives.

McSorley continued dealing, 

Penn State’s defense clamped 
down and the rout was on.

After the game, O’Korn drew 

a comparison. Last fall, it was 
the Nittany Lions who were left 
reeling after a blowout loss at the 
hands of the Wolverines. 

That Penn State team would 

go on to win the Big Ten. This 
Michigan team, O’Korn argued, 

could do the same.

But with two devastating losses 

in conference play already, it’s 
difficult to envision a scenario 
where 
the 
Wolverines 
still 

accomplish their preseason goals. 

Contenders 
don’t 
usually 

get third chances after they’ve 
already been knocked out twice. 
Michigan’s season was irreparably 
damaged by its loss Saturday 
night, and based on cornerback 
Lavert Hill’s glum reaction, it’s 
safe to say many Wolverines 
already understand that.

When asked what he had left to 

play for, Hill didn’t mention a Big 
Ten Championship or the College 
Football Playoff. 

He and his teammates have 

nothing left to play out but 
the string — and that’s a cold, 
unfamiliar 
reality 
that 
the 

Wolverines will have to learn 
how to deal with for the rest of 
the year.

‘M’ wins Big Ten championship 
in 1-0 victory over Northwestern

For the first time since 2011, 

the Michigan field hockey team 
is the outright regular season Big 
Ten champion.

Friday afternoon, the fourth-

ranked 
Wolverines 
(8-0 
Big 

Ten, 14-2 overall) took on No. 
8 Northwestern (5-2, 12-5) and 
earned a hard-fought 1-0 victory.

In the first half, Michigan 

outshot the Wildcats 8-3 and 
notched three penalty corners 
to 
Northwestern’s 
one. 
The 

Wolverines, 
however, 
were 

unable to convert their chances, 
and the two teams entered 
halftime in a scoreless tie.

The second frame, though, 

told a different story, with the 
Wildcats determined to increase 
their offensive aggressiveness.

Northwestern’s 
pressure 

resulted in two green cards for 
Michigan just two minutes into 
the second half. The Wolverines 
struggled to maintain possession, 
only worsening the situation.

But senior goalkeeper Sam 

Swenson came up big — as she 
has throughout her career — 
and saved the Wildcats’ three 
shot attempts. And as the half 
continued, the Wolverines began 
to find their footing. Around 20 
minutes in, Michigan flipped the 
script and put Northwestern on 
the defensive.

The Wolverines earned six 

penalty corners in the second 
half. 
They 
converted 
those 

into only one shot on goal. But 
that one shot proved to be the 
difference.

Just 10 minutes remained in 

regulation when junior defender 
Maggie Bettez pushed the ball 
out to sophomore midfielder 
Guadalupe Fernandez Lacort, 
who laid the ball off to senior 
midfielder 
Katie 
Trombetta. 

Trombetta’s shot was low and 
powerful, 
but 
a 
deflection 

sent 
it 
over 
the 
sprawling 

Northwestern goalkeeper to give 
the Wolverines the lead.

“Northwestern’s 
a 
great 

team and has a great defense,” 

said Michigan coach Marcia 
Pankratz. “We had a couple 
of opportunities, and we were 
just trying to stay patient and 
execute under pressure the best 
we can and it worked out.”

It was a dream finish to 

her regular season career for 
Trombetta, as her goal proved to 
be the decisive blow that pushed 
Michigan to the conference title.

“I mean, there are really no 

words to describe it,” Trombetta 
said. “We were just giving 
everything we got and to finish 
it off was just truly an incredible 
feeling. It just really amped us 
to finish those last nine minutes 
and not give them anything.”

The 
Wolverines 
controlled 

possession 
after 
they 
took 

the lead, but as time expired, 
Northwestern 
had 
one 
last 

chance off a penalty corner. Still, 
Michigan’s players held off their 
celebration and stayed composed 
in order to prevent a game-tying 
goal. 

“Don’t let them score, don’t let 

them get anything,” Trombetta 

said, 
describing 
her 
team’s 

mentality. “Just get it out and 
just give it all you goalkeeper 
your head down and keep your 
feet out the way.”

The Wolverines had clinched 

a share of the title last weekend 
with wins over Iowa and Indiana, 
but they maintained their focus 
on Friday and were able to win 
the conference outright.

“It’s a lot of pressure and they 

just stayed poised and tried to 
execute the gameplan,” Pankratz 
said. “They played as hard as 
they could, and I was just really 
proud of them.”

The 
Wolverines 
celebrated 

their championship at Ocker 
Field on Friday evening, but 
the team knows its season 
is far from over with the Big 
Ten Tournament coming up 
next weekend, and the NCAA 
Tournament soon thereafter.

“We want to work harder, 

and we want to win another 
championship,” Trombetta said. 
“It’s just going to keep pushing 
us to work as hard as we can.”

No surprise

This should come as no 

surprise.

As Saturday’s 42-13 blowout 

loss demonstrated, the 
Wolverines are not in the same 
league as No. 2 Penn State. And 
they never were.

Though Michigan’s 4-0 start 

planted seeds of optimism 
that the 
Wolverines 
could be 
better 
than what 
they were 
projected 
to be, it’s 
time for the 
harvest and 
the crops 
haven’t 
grown.

Michigan is no longer in the 

Associated Press Top-25 poll. 
That’s a long fall from grace for 
what was once considered the 
seventh-best team in the country.

Maybe that ranking made 

sense at the time. It doesn’t now.

To put it in perspective, Penn 

State was ranked No. 7 at the 
end of last season. That came 
after a year in which the Nittany 
Lions won the Big Ten and would 
have won the Rose Bowl over 
Southern California if not a last-
second field goal.

Of the five opponents 

Michigan has defeated this 
season, not one currently owns 
a winning record. The best of 
the five — then-No. 17 Florida — 
might have been blown out 33-17 
in the season opener, but seven 
weeks later, the Gators are just 
3-3.

Saturday night, while sitting 

in the visiting media room, fifth-
year senior quarterback John 
O’Korn tried to take a positive 
spin on the outlook of the 
Wolverines’ season.

“We can be as good as we 

want to be,” he said. “We’re 
gonna need some help now to 

accomplish all of our goals but … 
it’s up to us to make a decision to 
make this season what we want it 
to be.”

Before the 

year began, 
Michigan 
insisted that its 
goals centered 
on winning 
a Big Ten 
championship 
and contending 
for the College 
Football Playoff. 
Even though 
the Wolverines lost the majority 
of their starters on both offense 
and defense, they asserted that 
they were still capable of putting 
together that kind of season.

But maybe those shouldn’t 

have been the goals for a 
Michigan team with so much 
roster turnover. Even those 

Wolverines — the 
team with the 
most players 
selected in the 
NFL Draft last 
April — blew out 
the mediocre 
competition before 
falling short 
when faced with 
more challenging 
opposition 
courtesy of Iowa, 

Ohio State and Florida State at 
the end of the year.

At the start of this season, 

Michigan may have surpassed 
some of its expectations, thanks 
in large part to its No. 1 overall 

defense. Maybe before season-
ending injuries to redshirt junior 
quarterback Wilton Speight 
and freshman 
receiver Tarik 
Black, its 
offense would 
have had a 
better shot of 
doing the same.

But at this 

point, with 
contests 
against No. 
5 Wisconsin 
and No. 6 Ohio 
State still to come at the end of 
the year, an 8-4 season seems to 
be the most likely outcome for 
the Wolverines.

After the game, O’Korn was 

asked what message Michigan 

coach Jim Harbaugh had for 
his team given that strong 
possibility.

“The fake 

love’s gone,” he 
recalled. “There’s 
no bandwagon. It’s 
us. ”

Fifth-year senior 

linebacker Mike 
McCray backed him 
up, maintaining 
the belief that 
Michigan’s goal is 
to win out. 

As important as 

a confident mentality is, so is a 
firm grip of reality.

Just two weeks ago, the 

Wolverines said the same after 
an unexpected loss to Michigan 
State. They argued that one loss 

wouldn’t change their course of 
their season. But it essentially 
did.

Coming into the year, it was 

expected that Michigan would 
have to beat either Penn State, 
Wisconsin or Ohio State in order 
to prevent a step backward for 
the program. Not many people 
accounted for an additional loss, 
especially to a Spartan team 
coming off a 3-9 season.

Now, with two losses already, 

it would be bold to predict that 
the Wolverines will finish with 
fewer than four.

For Harbaugh, it would be the 

most losses of his tenure. After 
the game, he insisted that the 
Wolverines’ problems can be 
solved.

“We’re gonna do better. We’re 

gonna regroup, come back,” he 
said. “ ... We solve it with our 
team, and nobody can help us but 
us. We put our best people on it — 
our players and our coaches.”

When asked if they can be 

solved this season, his answer 
was a blunt: “Yes.”

I’m not so sure. Most of 

Michigan’s problems have 
to do with their youth and 
inexperience, important factors 
that somehow disappeared 
from the public consciousness 
after victories over teams that 
now look headed straight for 
nowhere.

Even those wins, from 

turnovers and penalties to bad 
decisions and halftime deficits, 
showed that the Wolverines 
have a lot of room to grow. Those 
games should have been the 
warning signs. 

While the experiences will be 

helpful for the future, that future 
involves buying a 2018 calendar.

That should come as no 

surprise.

Five Things We Learned: It’s officially a rebuilding year

Just last fall, it was Michigan 

celebrating 
a 
lopsided 

victory over Penn State. The 
Wolverines 
were 
the 
toast 

of 
college 
football, 
poised 

to 
contend 
for 
a 
national 

championship. 

What a difference one year 

makes.

The 
two 
teams 
have 

seemingly switched places. The 
Nittany Lions recovered from 
that loss and went on to win 
the conference title. Michigan 
ended the year with three 
losses in four games — and has 
now dropped two of its last 
three.

“We’ll find out a lot about 

this team, about this program 
over the next few weeks,” said 
fifth-year senior quarterback 
John O’Korn.

That’s certainly true. But 

we discovered a lot about the 
Wolverines in their 42-13 loss 
to Penn State, as well.

Here are five things we 

learned from Saturday night’s 
game.

1. Wolverines are rebuilding, 

not reloading

Urban Meyer won a national 

championship 
in 
his 
third 

year at Ohio State. So did Nick 
Saban.

It’s safe to say now that Jim 

Harbaugh won’t do the same. 
And, given everything we knew 
about this team, perhaps that 
shouldn’t have been a surprise.

After all, Michigan brought 

back 
just 
two 
starters 
on 

offense 
in 
redshirt 
junior 

quarterback 
Wilton 
Speight 

and senior offensive tackle 
Mason Cole. On defense, fifth-
year senior linebacker Mike 
McCray and fifth-year senior 
defensive 
tackle 
Maurice 

Hurst were the only returning 
starters.

It’s 
exceedingly 
difficult 

for 
teams 
to 
replace 
that 

many departures — and even 
more difficult to replace them 
with players who are in their 
first and second years, like 
Michigan has been forced to 
do. The depth from players who 
are now upperclassmen — those 
who joined the team in the 
2013, 2014 and 2015 recruiting 
classes — is severely lacking.

No 
matter 
what 
the 

Wolverines 
said 
in 
the 

offseason, it was always going 
to be tough to keep things 
running as smoothly as they 
had last year (at least through 
November). And now, with two 
losses in conference play and 
the Big Ten Title and College 
Football Playoff both out of 
sight, one thing has become 
very clear: this is a rebuilding 
year 
for 
Harbaugh 
and 

Michigan.

2. Matchups won the game 

for Penn State

In 
the 
third 
quarter, 

Michigan’s 
6-foot-4, 
248-

pound middle linebacker found 
himself in pass coverage on 
Saquon Barkley.

Predictably, 
things 
didn’t 

end well for Mike McCray on 
that play. But that isn’t his 
fault — that’s just better work 
by Joe Moorhead, Penn State’s 
offensive coordinator.

Moorhead put his players 

in positions to make plays 
all night, whether that was 
feeding Barkley the ball, giving 
receiver 
DaeSean 
Hamilton 

favorable matchups out of the 
slot against Michigan’s safeties 
or allowing McSorley to make 
easy decisions with run-pass 
options.

Michigan, 
meanwhile, 

was unable to do the same on 
offense. The Wolverines’ last-
ditch attempt on fourth-and-
eleven ended with O’Korn on 
the ground, only one of the 
seven times he was sacked on 
the night. Because O’Korn had 

to sell the play action, he had 
his back turned for most of the 
play, and Michigan didn’t leave 
any extra blockers in to help 
with pass protection.

He never even had a chance.

3. Quarterback play wasn’t 

the problem

O’Korn’s 
performance 
as 

the starter this year has come 
under criticism, and rightfully 
so. Before Saturday, he was 
averaging under five yards 
per 
attempt 
as 
Michigan’s 

pass offense scuffled along. 
On Saturday night, though, he 
played much better than he 
had against Michigan State or 
Indiana.

O’Korn 
completed 
16-of-

28 
passes 
for 
166 
yards, 

approaching 
six 
yards 
per 

attempt — and that number 

should’ve 
been 
higher, 
as 

several of his passes were 
dropped. O’Korn consistently 
made plays with his feet, 
as well, ripping off several 
scrambles and picking up first 
downs when things broke down 
in the pocket.

It 
wasn’t 
a 
perfect 

performance. 
But 
it 
was 

still a step forward — and if 
O’Korn remains the starter 
going forward over redshirt 
freshman Brandon Peters, it’s 
the type of performance he’ll 
need to replicate for Michigan 
to win games.

4. 
Michigan’s 
defensive 

line needed to play better

The Wolverines needed to 

make big defensive plays to have 
any chance at pulling off the 
upset. And while David Long 

did make a big interception and 
Lavert Hill recorded a crucial 
pass breakup on fourth-and-
seven, the defensive line was 
uncharacteristically 
silent. 

None of the starting defensive 
linemen — Hurst, sophomore 
defensive end Rashan Gary, 
redshirt junior defensive end 
Chase Winovich or redshirt 
junior defensive tackle Bryan 
Mone — recorded a sack.

The Nittany Lions managed 

to stay away from Hurst and 
Gary most of the game, while 
Winovich’s effectiveness was 
limited — perhaps due to an 
injury he suffered that took him 
into the locker room. Either 
way, 
Michigan 
desperately 

needed a big game from its 
fearsome defensive front to 
slow down the Penn State 
attack, and that didn’t happen.

5. 
BOLD 
PREDICTION: 

Brandon Peters starts seeing 
time next week

Asking 
the 
redshirt 

freshman to brave the hostile 
road environment at Happy 
Valley might’ve been too tall of 
a task. But now, Michigan may 
have no choice but to roll the 
dice with Peters. The Big Ten 
title is out of reach. So are the 
playoffs. O’Korn won’t be back 
next year, and Speight’s future 
remains unknown.

The Wolverines have nothing 

to lose by giving Peters time in the 
upcoming weeks in preparation 
for a larger role next year. After 
all, Rutgers, Minnesota and 
Maryland are hardly Murderers’ 
Row, and Michigan can still give 
O’Korn a majority of the snaps 
while still integrating Peters into 
the offense.

Daily Sports Editor

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh is facing the prospect of a third consecutive season in which his Wolverines finished third or worse in conference competition.

Third period key for ‘M’ in sweep

As the horn sounded at the 

end of the first period Friday 
night, freshman forward Josh 
Norris was down on the ice and 
unable to stand. He had been 
blindsided by a Vermont player 
between the circles and was 
writhing in pain. Norris couldn’t 
walk off under his own strength. 
With his arms wrapped around 
two teammates’ shoulders, he 
skated off to the dressing room, 
having only a missed penalty 
shot to show for it. 

Fast forward to under five 

minutes into the third period, 
and the Michigan hockey team 
was up 2-0. Having shrugged 
off the pain, Norris received a 
leading pass in the middle of 
the ice from sophomore forward 
Jake Slaker and found himself 
one-on-one 
against 
Vermont 

goaltender 
Stefanos 
Lekkas. 

The left-hander wouldn’t make 
the same mistake twice, deking 
the netminder and driving the 
puck into the net, glove side. 
Less than three minutes later, 
Norris scored his second goal, 
a backhander in front of the net 
off a pass from fellow freshman 
Quinn Hughes.

Bouncing 
back 
from 

an 
underwhelming 
first 

two periods in a game the 
Wolverines eventually won 4-1 
on Friday, Norris became the 
first Michigan player to score 
twice in his home debut since 
Kyle Connor in 2015.

Saturday 
night 
was 
a 

different story for Norris and 
the Wolverines, entering the 
final period trailing 2-1. With 
limited shots on goal through 
two periods, Michigan was 20 
minutes away from splitting 
its second series in as many 
weekends. 
Skating 
off 
the 

ice after the second period, 
the Wolverines were visibly 
frustrated 
about 
failing 
to 

capitalize on scoring chances.

But with under five minutes 

to go in the third, Slaker stepped 
up when his team needed it the 
most, scoring the equalizer from 
the right faceoff circle to tie the 
game at two. Then, with just 54 
seconds left, Slaker delivered 
another wrist shot that sailed 
into the back of the net to clinch 
Michigan’s third win and first 
weekend sweep on the season.

“It’s good they get rewarded 

for staying with the game plan 
and hanging in there,” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
after Saturday’s victory. “Our 
third periods have been pretty 
good this year so far, so it’s good 

to see that we’re a third-period 
team.”

Norris and Slaker followed 

eerily 
parallel 
paths 
in 

consecutive games. After four 
straight 
periods 
without 
a 

goal, the 18-year-old Norris 
had to mentally put aside his 
disappointing start and refocus 
before he finally broke through. 
Less than 24 hours later, Slaker 
also had to discard from his 
mind the uninspiring hockey 
played through the first two 
periods to get the offense back 
on track.

“I think you just have to keep 

pressing,” Norris said Friday. “I 
was frustrated with myself, had 
some really good opportunities 
in the first and second. My 
teammates made some great 

plays and I wasn’t converting, so 
I knew I had to bear down and 
eventually I knew something 
was going to go in, so I was 
happy that happened in the 
third.”

Added Slaker on Saturday: 

“We just try to stay focused and 
it doesn’t matter if they score 
within the first five minutes or 
in the first 20, we still have 40 
minutes left to play after that. … 
We just keep playing our game.”

Pearson’s praise of the two 

was oddly parallel, too.

“(Norris) stepped his game 

up even from two weeks ago,” 
Pearson said. “He looks like a 
different player than he was. 
… He’s a character kid, he’s got 
a lot of character. I thought he 
had a strong game. He plays 
both ends of the rink and he got 
rewarded.”

One night later, the same 

could be said about Slaker.

“You see what Jake’s all 

about, he can play any way you 
want,” Pearson said. “He can 
play a skill game, he can play 
a physical game, he can play a 
skating game, he’s got it all. He’s 
one of our hardest workers in 
practice and in games, so it was 
nice for him to get rewarded.”

Pearson 
emphasized 
the 

word 
“rewarded” 
countless 

times following both Friday 
and Saturday’s contests against 
Vermont. For Norris, Slaker 
and the entire team, Pearson 
chalked the victories up to being 
rewarded for hard work on both 
sides of the ice, playing through 
adversity and for sticking to the 
game plan.

Pearson admits that some 

nights the puck simply doesn’t 
bounce in his team’s favor. But he 
also knows that if the Wolverines 
can continue to dig deep and 
fight past early setbacks, it’s the 
later moments of the game when 
they will capitalize and squeeze 
out important wins. And if they 
can do that, they will certainly 
be rewarded.

It’s good they

McSorley, Hamilton dominate
Michigan’s safeties in blowout

STATE COLLEGE — Trace 

McSorley knew he was going to face 
man coverage. His receiving core 
did too. And every passing offense 
that has faced Michigan since Don 
Brown’s arrival in 2016 has known 
the same thing.

The difference, though, is that 

McSorley — along with wide 
receiver DaeSean Hamilton — were 
the ones to beat it. And they beat it 
badly.

For all the shine that this unit 

has received, for one night in State 
College, the Wolverines’ defense got 
punched in the mouth. It conceded 
42 points — the highest total since 
Ohio State hit the same mark in 
2015. And it gave up 506 yards, 282 
of which came in the air.

“I think we just did a really good 

job of manipulating our matchups 
and taking advantage of them,” 
McSorley said. “Our guys did a great 
job winning versus man. We knew 
we were gonna get that. And we 
really kind of took to heart — the 
receiver group — if someone wants 
to try to man you up, say ‘Our guys 
are better than your guys.’

“That’s not a disrespect thing, but 

it’s a challenge. It’s a challenge that 
you’ve got to step up to and be ready 
for. And I think that’s something 

that our receivers really took to 
heart, like, ‘Alright we’re gonna get 
man coverage, let’s go.’”

That’s exactly what the second-

ranked Nittany Lions did, none 
more so than Hamilton. The senior 
receiver finished with six receptions 
for 115 yards, and made a Michigan 
secondary that was ranked second 
in the nation before Saturday night’s 
contest look lost. And in large part, 
the result came from Penn State’s 
clinical assault on the Wolverines’ 
safeties.

That attack started on Penn 

State’s fifth drive of the game. 
Hamilton beat junior safety Tyree 
Kinnel badly before catching a pass 
for 27 yards. It was just a glimpse of 
what was to come.

On 
the 
Wolverines’ 
next 

defensive 
possession, 
McSorley 

went to Hamilton again. The ball 
was underthrown by an inch, but 
Hamilton left no doubt as to who 
would be coming down with the 
ball — adjusting his body to nab a 
36-yard reception over Kinnel’s 
head and jumpstarting Penn State’s 
touchdown drive at the end of the 
half.

“I thought the play that he made 

on their sideline where he went up 
and, the ball was a little short, and 
he went up and caught it in traffic — 
they’re the plays you have to make 
in these types of games, especially 

against this style of defense,” said 
Penn State coach James Franklin. 
“You’ve gotta be able to make them 
pay for playing so aggressive.”

The Nittany Lions did so for the 

rest of the game. Kinnel got beat 
once more. Sophomore safety Josh 
Metellus was beat twice for 49 yards. 
And it all came from the first-half 
ripple effect.

As Franklin explained, he saw 

a Wolverine squad on film that 
emphasized outside leverage and 
tried to funnel everything toward 
the safety. He’s not wrong. But with 
Hamilton’s early success on the deep 
ball, Michigan’s coverage made the 
field even wider.

From there, Penn State had the 

Wolverines right where it wanted 
them — implementing designed 
slants at halftime that were never 
meant to factor into its game plan.

“After I had a few inside fades 

on them, they started pressing me 
more,” Hamilton said. “They were 
just trying to slow down at least the 
timing. … Once we saw that, I was 
able to fake as if I was gonna go run 
an inside fade, and that would open 
the inside a lot more. That’s why we 
were able to connect on some slants.”

Those slants proved to be the 

body blows. The deep balls were 
the haymakers. And in the end, 
Michigan’s defense had a long fall to 
the mat.

Offenses a mismatch in State College

STATE COLLEGE — It was the 

impossible test waiting to happen.

Coming into a matchup against 

No. 2 Penn State, the No. 19 Michi-
gan football team knew what it 
needed to do. Its top-ranked defense 
would likely be canceled out by the 
Nittany Lions’ ninth-ranked unit, so 
it would be up to its offense to play 
up to par with Penn State’s.

But 
matching 
the 
offensive 

firepower of quarterback Trace 
McSorley and running back Saquon 
Barkley is a tall task. Saturday night, 
in a 42-13 loss, it proved to be too 
much to ask.

The Nittany Lions entered the 

game averaging 39.7 points per 
game, while the Wolverines were 
averaging 27.2. Fifth-year senior 
quarterback John O’Korn and 
junior running back Karan Higdon 
needed to lead the effort in closing 
the gap, but when Penn State hit 
them, Michigan couldn’t answer 
back.

The opening five minutes were a 

microcosm of the game as a whole. 
The Nittany Lion offense scored 
two touchdowns. The Wolverine 
offense went three-and-out twice.

They both ran six plays, but to 

completely different results.

On Penn State’s first drive, 

McSorley completed a six-yard 
pass and then Barkley took a direct 
snap 69 yards into the end zone for 
a touchdown.

On Michigan’s initial drive, Hig-

don rushed twice for three yards 
before O’Korn was sacked for a loss 
of five.

For the Nittany Lions’ second 

act, Barkley rushed for five yards, 
McSorley rushed for 23, McSorley 
threw for 35 and Barkley ran the last 
15 for another score.

For the Wolverines’ follow-up, 

Higdon rushed twice for three 
yards again before O’Korn complet-
ed a pass for a loss of six.

Where Penn State looked explo-

sive, Michigan looked static. If it 
weren’t for a momentum-stopping 
interception from sophomore cor-
nerback David Long, the Nittany 
Lions may have kept the ball rolling 
and the Wolverines may never have 
found life.

“I thought their offense played 

extremely well. Understatement,” 
said Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
“They were hitting on all cylinders.”

Michigan responded to the pick 

with a renewed sense of vigor, scor-
ing 13 unanswered points in the sec-
ond quarter.

On the first scoring drive, O’Korn 

threw for 21 yards and rushed for 12, 
while Higdon rushed for 12 and the 
touchdown.

On the second, O’Korn passed 

for 41 yards and rushed for 14, while 
fifth-year senior running back Ty 
Isaac rushed for 11 and the score.

With 1:45 left in the first half, 

the Wolverines had managed to cut 
their deficit to 14-13. It looked like 
Michigan’s offense could go toe-to-
toe with Penn State’s despite the 
early shot to the face.

But in a mere 52 seconds, McSor-

ley and Barkley showed why the 
Nittany Lions are on a level the Wol-
verines haven’t reached.

McSorley completed a 12-yard 

pass and then a 36-yard bomb. Bar-
kley ran for another nine. And then 
McSorley sealed the deal with a 
17-yard completion and a three-yard 
rush up the middle.

With 53 seconds left in the half, 

Penn State stretched its lead back 
out to eight. Michigan didn’t score 
again Saturday.

“To me, that was the biggest 

thing,” O’Korn said. “They made the 
big plays and we didn’t.”

After the Wolverines went three 

and out again, the Nittany Lions 
got the ball back with six seconds 
left. They had enough time to take 
a deep shot at the end zone. With 
the success of their big plays on the 
night, it would have been expected 
for them to at least try.

They took a knee instead. Michi-

gan didn’t give them a reason why 
they shouldn’t.

Penn State went on to score a 

total of 42 points, which is the most 
the Wolverine defense has given 
up under coordinator Don Brown. 
After the game, fifth-year senior 
linebacker Mike McCray spoke on 
behalf on his unit. He was at a loss 
for words.

“(It was) pretty much everything 

we’ve seen,” he said. “They had a 
great scheme.”

That pretty much said it all. 

Michigan’s defense couldn’t contain 
the Nittany Lions’ offense, despite 
knowing what was coming. But 
just as importantly, the Wolverines’ 
offense couldn’t match up with it.

Michigan brought a knife to a 

gun fight, and after taking mul-
tiple shots, the Wolverines simply 
couldn’t get up.

Barkley deserves the Heisman

S

TATE COLLEGE — 
Beaver Stadium trembled 
as fireworks burst over 

Happy Valley. A regular season 
game with a Super Bowl 
atmosphere.

The 

night was 
fit for a 
superstar, 
and the 
superstar 
that 
delivered 
was the one 
everyone 
expected.

Penn 

State running back Saquon 
Barkley carved up the nation’s 
No. 1 defense in the Nittany 
Lions’ 42-13 win, validating 
his case as the best player in 
college football.

He didn’t set a career high 

in rushing yards, receiving 
yards or touchdowns, but 
he did something that no 
other tailback could — run 
successfully against Michigan.

Nobody had run like him 

against the Wolverines. Prior 
to Saturday, not a single player 
on any of Michigan’s previous 
six opponents had over 100 
rushing yards, and as a unit, 
the defense gave up an average 
of just 85 rushing yards per 
game.

Barkley alone surpassed that 

in the first quarter.

“A lot of running backs 

were able to get open (against 
Michigan), but none were able 
to finish it or find a way to get 
into the end zone,” Barkley 
said. “That’s something I took 
ownership of this week.”

He called it a “heavyweight 

fight.” Sometimes Michigan’s 
defense would get the stop, 
and other times Barkley would 
punch back for a short gain. 
When either side could land a 
knockout punch, they had to 
take it.

Barkley accepted short 

gains all game long. Four-yard 

rushes, two-yard rushes and 
even negative-yard rushes. But 
when he got the chance to split 
the gap and break through, he 
pounced.

On the second play of 

Penn State’s opening drive, 
Barkley lined up for a direct 
snap and ran the ball 69 yards 
straight into the end zone. He 
burned Michigan’s secondary, 
outrunning the linebackers, the 
cornerbacks and the safeties. 
Nobody could catch Saquon 
Barkley.

It was one of those plays 

that will be on the highlight 
reel when Barkley suits up 
for the Heisman ceremony in 
December.

“We haven’t seen that on 

film,” said fifth-year senior 
linebacker Mike McCray about 
the direct snap to Barkley. 
“He’s a great player, got to give 
a lot of credit to him.”

And four minutes later, on 

the Nittany Lions’ next drive, 
he caught an option pitch and 
dashed to the goal line again to 
give Penn State a 14-point lead.

“The back is really good, 

as advertised,” Harbaugh 

said of Barkley. “(Penn State) 
hit us on quite a few plays 
we’ve defensed well this year. 
Their execution was really 
good tonight, right from the 
beginning.”

The Wolverines have 

stopped mobile quarterbacks 
and quality running backs 
already. Other teams 
simply couldn’t run as fast 
as Michigan. Sophomore 
linebacker Devin Bush prides 
himself on his speed, and 
he’s one of the Big Ten’s best 
linebackers because of it. But 
not even Bush could keep up 
with Barkley.

On his 69-yard touchdown 

run, Barkley clocked in at 22.9 
miles per hour. He ran to the 
end zone faster than a high-
schooler in his first Drivers Ed 
class.

But it’s not only Barkley’s 

speed. He’s got all the right 
mental components, too.

In the second quarter, 

Barkley was wide open on a 
route and had eyes for the end 
zone, but when the pass came 
in his direction, he couldn’t 
hold on. A completion would 

have put the Nittany Lions up 
21-0, but for just one moment, 
he had lost focus.

And that’s the play Barkley 

said will stick with him most 
from this game.

Not either of his rushing 

touchdowns, and not the 
juggled receiving touchdown 
in the third quarter. He doesn’t 
worry about the highlights. He 
remembers the plays where he 
could’ve done better.

“Sometimes I overthink and 

put myself in bad situations. … I 
was thinking ‘score,’ ” he said. 
“It humbles you again. Makes 
you realize that you got to put a 
little more work in and find the 
way to make those plays.”

Combine Barkley’s 

workhorse mentality with his 
blistering speed, and you’ve 
got one hell of a football player. 
There aren’t many players like 
Saquon Barkley, so when he 
gets on the field, make sure to 
be watching.

But don’t blink. You might 

miss him.

Penn State running back Saquon Barkley built on his Heisman campaign with 108 yards and two touchdowns Saturday.

FOOTBALL
The good, the bad and
the ugly: Penn State

For all of the theatrics that 

came with Saturday night’s contest 
in Beaver Stadium, No. 2 Penn 
State’s performance still may have 
warranted more.

Michigan 
was 
punched 
in 

the 
mouth 
from 
the 
get-go, 

Saquon Barkley looked every bit a 
Heisman winner and the Nittany 
Lions provided a very convincing 
argument that their standing among 
the nation’s best is warranted.

The Wolverines, on the other 

hand, had little to nothing to show 
for a trip to State College and are 
now faced with the discouraging 
task of finishing a season void of 
much meaning.

The Daily breaks down the good, 

the bad and the ugly from Saturday’s 
42-13 blowout:

The good
Well, the Nittany Lions didn’t get 

their shame-inducing touchdown. 
And that’s about it.

With four seconds left in the 

game, Penn State had the ball on 
Michigan’s six-yard line. James 
Franklin could have told his team to 
take a knee and ride quietly into the 
night with a 29-point lead.

Instead, 
the 
Nittany 
Lions 

sideline pleaded for a chance to 
put an exclamation point on the 
blowout. Penn State got the snap 
off in time, and sophomore running 
back Miles Sanders was given the 
ball with a chance to run up the 
score and rub salt in Michigan’s 
wound.

Thanks to Khaleke Hudson and 

Michael Dwumfour, Sanders was 
tackled for a four-yard loss and a 
game that had long been over finally 
came to a close.

The bad
Fifth-year senior quarterback 

John O’Korn didn’t mince words.

“The fake love’s gone,” he said. 

“There’s no bandwagon. It’s us. 
That’s what we want. Whether 
we’re doing great or bad, it’s just 

all about us, and from here on out, 
that’s what it’s going to be about.”

O’Korn couldn’t be more right.
For 
four 
weeks, 
Michigan 

convinced its fan base that a year 
intended for rebuilding could turn 
into something special. A loss to 
Michigan State dented that outlook. 
And last night’s thrashing in State 
College 
undoubtedly 
brought 

everyone back to reality.

Michigan’s 
College 
Football 

Playoff hopes are dead. A Big Ten 
championship would be an act of 
divine intervention.

It seemed likely that, eventually, 

the Wolverines would lose their 
second conference game. But the 
loss of their preseason goals stings 
a lot more given that it came in just 
week seven.

The Wolverines have five games 

left on their schedule, and they’ll 
be playing for nothing more than 
pride.

The ugly
What was once ranked as the No. 

1 defense in the nation was battered, 
bruised and bludgeoned Saturday 
night.

It 
started 
with 
a 
69-yard 

touchdown run by Saquon Barkley 
on the second play of a game. It 
ended with quarterback Trace 
McSorley trotting nine yards into 
the end zone before Franklin put in 
the reserves.

And there was plenty of damage 

done in between. Barkley totaled 
108 yards and two touchdowns, 
McSorley tore apart the Wolverines’ 
secondary to the tune of 10.8 yards 
per attempt and wide receiver 
DaeSean Hamilton posted a 115-
yard performance.

The Nittany Lions became the 

first team to score 42 points against 
Michigan since Ohio State did so in 
2015, and the Wolverines gave up 
506 yards on the night.

McSorley said that the Nittany 

Lions 
took 
Michigan’s 
man 

coverage as a challenge. Saturday 
night, that certainly appeared to be 
the case.
