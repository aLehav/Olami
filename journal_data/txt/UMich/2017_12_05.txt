City Council was rocked 

again 
Monday 
night 
as 

residents continued to show 
resistance 
against 
a 
$146 

million 
development 
plan 

on 
Broadway 
Street, 
near 

the University of Michigan 
Hospital.

It 
was 
the 
culmination 

of yet another episode in 
the 
divisions 
that 
have 

characterized 
Ann 
Arbor 

politics 
in 
recent 
years. 

Though most council members 
agree increasing density and 
housing supply are crucial for 
the city’s development, some 
residents fear the character 
of their neighborhoods will be 
changed for the worse.

At 
contention 
was 

whether to switch the zoning 
designation of the Broadway 
site 
from 
Planned 
Unit 

Development 
to 
Campus 

Business Residential District, 
or C1A/R. Proponents of the 
switch, like Councilmember 
Chip Smith, D-Ward 5, say 
C1A/R is will provide seamless 
integration 
for 
high-rises 

to the surrounding campus 
community.

“The campus has expanded 

pretty greatly over the last 
two decades. I think it’s 
disingenuous to say that the 
Medical Campus is not part 
of the University complex and 
therefore it shouldn’t count 
(under C1A/R),” Smith said.

However, 
the 
highrises 

Smith is envisioning under 
C1A/R is the exact type of 
situation many residents who 
live on or near Broadway Street 
would want to avoid. There 
have been numerous rounds of 
negotiations between the city, 
residents 
and 
Morningside 

— the developer that also 
owns the land — on what the 
final development will look 
like, some residents are still 

disgruntled. One resident said 
having 
a 
downtown-sized 

building in a quieter low-rise 
neighborhood would never be 
a prudent idea.

Another 
resident, 
Steve 

Kaplan, 
questioned 
the 

amount of commercial activity 
that 
a 
C1A/R 
designation 

would bring, arguing that 
businesses must gather around 
an area organically.

“We could build the hollow 

boxes on the street and then 
hope for another decade they 
would fill up with hat shops 
and bodegas,” he said. “I don’t 
think they’re going to come.”

When a pro-development 

resident 
criticized 
those 

opposed to the development 
as not thinking about long-
term benefits and called them 
“NIMBYs,” 
condemnation 

came 
quickly 
from 
all 

Rosie the Robot Maid in “The 

Jetsons” and R2-D2 in “Star 
Wars” are highly advanced robots 
that can clean, prepare meals and 
even send secret messages. While 
the robots of today have not yet 
reached this level of intelligence, 
Dmitry Berenson and Jason Corso, 
associate professors of electrical 
engineering and computer science, 
are working with teams of graduate 
students in the hopes that they one 
day will.

Their 
current 
research, 

supported by the Toyota Research 
Institute, 
involves 
developing 

algorithms to make a robot able 
to search for and find objects in 
assortments 
of 
several 
items. 

They refer to the project as 
“Manipulating Piles of stuff.”

Berenson’s group focuses on the 

motion-planning and manipulation 
components — figuring out how to 
make the robot actually move the 
objects. Corso’s group focuses on 
the robot’s perception of the objects 
and the surrounding environment.

Michigan is one of eight states 

in the country with more opioid 
prescriptions than people. As a part 
of a public awareness campaign, 
the University of Michigan has 
organized an online teach-out 
course to deleve into the roots of 
the crisis—the freee course opened 
for public access Monday.

James DeVaney, associate vice 

provost for Academic Innovation, 
explained University teach-outs 
are done in a collaborative effort 
from a variety of departments 
throughout the school and offer 
a platform on which faculty, 
students and global audiences can 
communicate through.

“The opioid epidemic is a perfect 

topic for the U-M Teach-Out 
Series,” he said. “It is a complex 
problem 
that 
requires 
wide-

ranging expertise in order to begin 
to develop meaningful solutions. It 
is a discussion that is strengthened 
by experts at U-M and the lived 
experiences of public learners 
around the world.”

Opioids are commonly known 

painkillers that have a high rate 
of addiction, abuse and overdose.

University

Michigan 

police officers are currently 
investigating 
an 
armed 

robbery that occurred Monday 
night in West Quad Residence 
Hall. Three unknown male 
suspects were involved in 
the incident with three other 
student 
victims, 
according 

to Division of Public Safety 
and Security spokeswoman 
Diane Brown. The suspects 
fled from West Quad, but 
their 
whereabouts 
remain 

unknown. 

Brown said a gun was 

brandished 
and 
property 

was demanded in the assault. 
Around 9 p.m., Brown said, 
three unknown students were 
in a resident room in West 
Quad. An hour later, two of 
those students were physically 
beaten by the suspects, though 
it remains unclear who exactly 
was party to the assault.

Police were notified around 

10:30 p.m.

Residents 
were 
initially 

asked to stay in their rooms 
as a precaution in both West 
Quad and South Quad — as a 
possible person of interest was 
initially wrongly suspected to 
be in the latter residence hall 
— but as of late Monday night, 
residents were free to move 
around.

“There is no lockdown, 

and no shooter,” Pieknik said. 
“We are still investigating 
… residents are OK to move 
around.”

Resident advisers in both 

halls 
speculating 
about 

the incident initially asked 
residents to stay in their 
rooms, 
close 
their 
blinds 

and turn off lights. These 
preliminary 
precautions 

were lifted by DPSS shortly 
thereafter.

West Quad resident Carola 

Jansohn, an LSA freshman, 
said she did not hear about the 
robbery until she saw officers 
in the South Quad lobby.

“They said it was an armed 

robbery 
and 
he 
escaped,”

Bipartisan panel on tax reform
contends with hasty Congress bill

University President Mark Schlissel, Former Republican Congressman Dave Camp, and Public Policy Dean Michael Barr discuss the federal tax reforms in Annen-
berg Auditorium Monday.

Despite GOP support, many worry bill will hurt low-income families, graduate students

With a new tax bill on the 

horizon, the Ford School of Public 
Policy organized a panel on tax 
reform with Public Policy dean 
Michael S. Barr and former U.S. Rep. 
Dave Camp, R-Mich., moderated by 
University of Michigan President 
Mark Schlissel.

The 
panel, 
which 
was 

arranged earlier in the semester, 
coincidentally 
took 
place 

Monday afternoon just as House 

Republicans passed their version of 
the tax reform bill mid-November 
and Senate Republicans passed 
their 
version 
early 
Saturday 

morning.

Camp served in the House of 

Representatives from 1991 to 2015, 
and as chairman of the House 
Committee on Ways and Means 
from 2011 to 2015. Barr served 
as the U.S. Department of the 
Treasury assistant secretary for 
financial institutions in 2009 and 
2010.

The panelists discussed different 

aspects of the tax reform bills — the 

corporate income tax, impacts on 
higher education — as well as bills’ 
potential and expected economic 
impacts, and what happens next.

“Right now, we’ll be looking at 

a conference committee and that’s 
typically what happens after a bill 
passes. Under our system, the exact 
same language has to pass both the 
House and the Senate before it’s 
sent to the president,” Camp said. 
“These bills are different in many 
ways, so they’ll have a conference 
committee. Now I think this will 
be a relatively short conference 
committee because they’re on 

this time deadline. And the time 
deadline really is (regarding) the 
election in Alabama, that they don’t 
want to lose any votes.”

As chairman of the House 

Committee on Ways and Means, 
Camp worked on the Tax Reform 
Bill of 2014, which was never signed 
into law. He said the bipartisanship 
in writing the 2014 bill differed 
from the recent bills that have been 
passed along party lines in the 
House and the Senate.

The proposed reduction of the 

corporate tax rate has been a key

This 
fall, 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan 
launched 
an 

undergraduate 
public 
health 

program 
for 
the 
first 
time, 

welcoming its first cohort of 95 
upper-level students. University 
students applied to the program 
the winter of their sophomore 
year, and planned to take classes 
through the School of Public 
Health throughout their junior and 
senior years.

The 
program 
offers 
two 

degrees. One, a Bachelor of Arts 
in community and global public 
health, looks at public health 
through the lens of social and 
behavioral sciences by focusing on 
broader community issues related 
to the field. The other, a Bachelor of 
Science in public health sciences, 

concentrates primarily on the 
natural 
and 
applied 
sciences 

within public health.

Looking back on the program 

over the course of the semester, 
Gary Harper, the director of the 
Office of Undergraduate Education 
at the School of Public Health, 
would consider its time so far 
overall a success.

“I’m extremely happy with how 

it’s going,” Harper said. “As the 
director, I meet with small groups 
of our students in meetings we 
call ‘dialogues with the director.’ 
I’ve probably met with about 
three-quarters of our 95 students 
already in these groups, so I’ve 
been hearing continual feedback 
throughout the entire semester. I 
think that, in general, we’ve been 
able to do what it is we set out to 
do.”

Faith 
Reynolds, 
a 
junior 

pursuing the school’s Bachelor 
of Arts degree, pointed to this 

openness to feedback as a strength 
of the new program. She said the 
faculty has been very responsive 
to students’ input and suggestions 
regarding classes, professors and 
the overall atmosphere of the 
school, which has helped make her 
time a positive experience so far.

“The program has either met 

or exceeded (my expectations),” 
Reynolds said. “I knew it was 
going to be a group effort (between 
faculty and students) to getting the 
best experience out of it, but I think 
it’s been going really well. I don’t 
think anyone would really disagree 
with that.”

Omar Ilyas, a junior aiming 

for the Public Health School’s 
sciences track, joined the program 
for 
its 
strong 
emphasis 
on 

interdisciplinary training. For him, 
the program’s multidisciplinary 
approach to public health made 
it the perfect fit for his variety of 
interests.

“I’ve always been interested 

in a lot of things — I was pre-
law, I was pre-business, I was 
pre-med ¬— I studied a lot of 
different things,” he said. “The 
beauty of this program is it’s 
an intersection of business, of 
health care, of policy. All the 
things I really enjoy, I found 
them in this program.”

Ilyas 
said 
this 

multidisciplinary 
approach 

is also reflected in his class 
workload. He explained that 
even within the structure 
of each class there is a 
comprehensive approach to 
learning — classes incorporate 
a 
mixture 
of 
discussion, 

homework, 
research, 
tests, 

presentations 
and 
writing. 

Though this can be difficult at 
times, Ilyas said the challenges 
are worth it because students 
will graduate with a strong 
foundation in a variety of types 
of work that will help them in 
future careers.

Though he is happy with 

the program so far in terms 

The University of Michigan’s 

School of Music, Theatre & Dance 
is guaranteed a Grammy win in 
this year’s Musical Theater Album 
category.

All three albums nominated 

in the category have something 
important in common — they are 
all connected to Music, Theatre and 
Dance alumni.

Ian Eisendrath, who earned 

his 
Bachelor 
of 
Music 
from 

the University in 2003, is the 
musical supervisor and arranger 
for acclaimed Broadway show 
“Come 
From 
Away.” 
Musical 

duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, 
honored at last year’s Bicentennial 
Commencement 
Ceremony, 

graduated in 2006 and composed 
and produced the original cast 
album for the musical “Dear Evan 
Hansen.” And Gavin Creel, a 1998 
Bachelor of Fine Arts graduate, 
plays a lead role in “Hello, Dolly!” 
— the last show nominated for the 
award.

Pasek and Paul were also 

nominated for Best Song Written 

for Visual Media with their song 
“City of Stars” from the film “La La 
Land.”

All three shows were also 

nominated for Tony awards earlier 
this year, with Pasek and Paul 
winning the award for Best Original 
Score Written for Theater and 
Creel winning Best Performance by 
a Featured Actor in a Musical.

“I want to dedicate this to the 

musical theatre department of the 
University of Michigan School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance,” Creel 
said in his Tony Award acceptance 
speech. “My education there as 
a young person changed my life 
forever.”

Several other Music, Theatre 

& 
Dance 
alumni 
have 
been 

nominated for Grammys as well. 
Tenor Nicholas Phan, an Ann 
Arbor native and 2001 University 
graduate, was nominated in the 
Classical Solo Album category for 
his album “Gods & Monsters.”

The 
Choral 
Performance 

category also has strong Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 

representation. 
One 
of 
the 

nominations, Bryars: The Fifth 
Century, combines the PRISM 
Quartet with The Crossing, a mixed 
choir. The PRISM quartet is made 
up entirely of alumni — members 
Matthew Levy, Zachary Shemon, 
Taimur Sullivan and Timothy 
McAllister 
all 
studied 
under 

Donald Sinta, associate professor 
emeritus 
of 
saxophone. 
The 

Crossing includes current doctoral 
student Kelly Bixby.

The 60th Grammy Awards 

will take place at New York City’s 
Madison Square Garden on Sunday, 
Jan. 28, 2018.

feature of the recent tax reform 
bills and has been met with both 
criticism and praise, from the 
left and right, respectively. While 
Camp sees the reduction as 
opening the possibility for more 
economic growth and attracting 
business, Barr believes there are 
much more direct ways to raise 
wages and boost the economy.

“I think for this tax bill, these 

ideas that we need more growth in 
the economy was really a priority,” 
Camp said. “And the second was, 
‘How do we align ourselves with 
the rest of the world in terms of 
international tax policy?’”

“This bill, if you say the basic 

goal is helping the middle class 
or working-class people, there 
are much more direct ways to 
do that,” Barr said. “You could 
expand earned income credit, you 
could not do some of the other 
provisions that have to do with 
eliminating health coverage, you 
could lower the rates at the bottom 
and increase them at the top.”

Though Law student Shay 

Moyal does not necessarily agree 
with the reform bills, he said there 
are parts of it he still needs to 
learn more about.

“I have a lot of feelings about 

the tax bill and I still need to learn 
it. I believe it’s probably more 
aggressive than I think it should 
be, but everyone has (their) own 
opinion,” Moyal said. “I know 
something they missed a lot was 
the international aspect.”

Following the Congressional 

Budget Office, which is recognized 
for doing nonpartisan analysis on 

legislation, reported there would 
be a $1.4 trillion increase in the 
deficit — and Camp said there has 
not been as much talk about the 
possibility of raising the deficit as 
there has been in the past.

“In 2010, I would say the deficit 

was just a white-hot issue,” Camp 
said. “Clearly, that has subsided 
significantly and there could be 
another reason for that, but in 
this last presidential election, we 
didn’t really (touch) on the deficit 
at all from either side.”

Public Policy senior Connor 

Priest said he had heard many 
of the points made by the panel 
already and does not support the 
reform bills. 

“I think what they had to say 

was inciteful, but overall just 
echoes 
common, 
mainstream 

things you hear about tax reform 
if you read up on it,” Priest said. 
“I think it’s (the bill’s) absolutely 
horrible. I think it’s the most 
horrendous piece of legislation 
that has come to the floor of 
Congress in years.”

Both the House bill and the 

Senate bill were rushed to the 
floor, in a manner neither Barr 

nor Camp agreed with. Senate 
Democrats took to social media to 
show the handwritten provisions 
written in, despite being illegible.

Schlissel 
introduced 
the 

concerns of many in higher 
education regarding the House 
bill, 
which 
would 
end 
tax 

deductions 
for 
student 
loan 

interest and tax tuition waivers for 
graduate students, and moderated 
Barr’s. 

Graduate 
students 
have 

expressed 
concern 
over 
the 

taxation of tuition waivers PhD 
candidates earn through teaching 
and research.

“We 
use 
the 
federal 

government to support lots of 
activities in the economy that we 
think are important. It’s hard to 
imagine a part of the economy 
that’s 
more 
important 
than 

investing in our human capital, 
in our students and young people 
to get their education,” Barr said. 
“There’s always room for maybe 
a simplification of that … but 
if I were making the choices, I 
would be doubling down on the 
tax support we provide to our 
students, not reducing it.”

cooperation between the two 
groups.

“This is more of a collaborative 

effort,” he said.

The two groups perform tests 

on two robotic arms manufactured 
by KUKA, a supplier of robotic 
hardware, in the Autonomous 
Robotic Lab. In these tests, they 
place a pile of bean bags or laundry 
in front of the robot and transmit 
the appropriate information so 
that it can find the desired object.

This task is momentous for 

robots, according to Berenson. He 
explained it is difficult for robots to 
respond to complex assortments of 
several objects.

“It turns out it’s much more 

complicated,” 
he 
said. 
“The 

reason is that when the object is 
by itself, you just kind of identify 
it. But when it’s in a pile or a stack, 
you have to actually move other 
objects out of the way first. You 
have to basically be able to reason 

about what you do when you 
can’t really see everything in the 
environment.”

Venkataraman compared how 

challenging these actions are for 
robots to how inherent they are for 
humans.

“What we feel as humans is so 

intuitive,” he said. “It’s like this 
is not even a task, it’s so easy. But 
looking at it from the perspective 
of a robot, this is a very complicated 
task. When (a robot) looks at an 
image, you need to isolate that this 
is there, then you need to make a 
plan. All of these are parameters 
you need to change.”

Dale 
McConachie, 
an 

Engineering 
Ph.D. 
student 

working with Berenson’s team, 
noted the difficulty is enhanced by 
the fact objects like bean bags or 
pieces of laundry are deformable. 
They’re harder for a robot to 
manipulate than something hard 
and rigid.

“Math 
is 
really 
good 
at 

describing where something hard 
and rigid is, and if I move my head, 
where does it go?” he said. “We 

can do that to some extent with 
deformable objects, but it gets 
very computationally messy very 
quickly. There’s an infinite number 
of 
dimensions 
for 
something 

soft and squishy, so how do you 
describe that efficiently? Do you 
even need to?”

However, to advance robots 

so they can succeed in a human 
environment, overcoming these 
challenges is necessary. Human 
homes, hospitals and a variety 
of other places are uncertain, 
sometimes hectic environments. 
Brent Griffin, an assistant research 
scientist 
in 
the 
Department 

of Electrical Engineering and 
Computer Science, also works 
on the team and discussed the 
unforeseeability 
in 
human 

environments and the importance 
of trying to develop a robot that 
can solve many kinds of problems.

“Robotics has a lot of success 

in industry because there’s a lot of 
predictability and certainty,” he 
said. “We can spend a lot of time 
tuning or preparing a robot for 
this specific problem. The thing 

that we’re trying to get towards 
is getting to the point where you 
can have a general applications 
robot and be fairly robust to a lot 
of uncertainty in the environment, 
because that’s really what is more 
difficult about operating in human 
environments.”

Griffin noted the robotics field 

has developed the appropriate 
hardware for achieving this goal. 
He has recently been working 
with a mobile robot named Fetch. 
According to Griffin, Fetch is just 
as physically capable as the robots 
in movies, but the software used to 
make it function isn’t yet up to par.

Ultimately, according to the 

researchers, their goal is to make 
robots commonplace in the lives 
of humans, specifically the elderly 
and 
people 
with 
disabilities. 

Berenson believes their research 
can be applied to almost any real-
world scenario.

“Just anywhere you encounter 

a complicated arrangement where 
you have to find the object in that 
arrangement is where you can 
apply this kind of work,” he said.

These characteristics are what 
make these drugs so dangerous, 
especially when nearly a quarter 
of a billion opioid prescriptions 
were written in 2013, according 
to the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention. According to 
Michigan State Police and a Kaiser 
Family 
Foundation 
analysis, 

more 
Michiganders 
die 
from 

opioid abuse than firearms or car 
accidents. With the increased 
availability, deaths due to drug 
overdoses involving opioids are 
increasing — taking over 90 
American lives a day.

The teach-out will offer an 

in-depth look at the problem 
and these concerns, showing the 
multiple causes and results of the 
epidemic, as well as ways the public 
can help fight this growing plague.

“Participants will have the 

opportunity to understand the 
current epidemic by exploring the 
topic from multiple perspectives,” 
Devaney said. “Before participants 

identify and propose new solutions 
to the crisis, they will learn about 
the build up to the crisis, the role 
of pharmacies, the role of the 
medical community, the role of 
the pharmaceutical industry and 
the role of families. Learners will 
understand how we got here, 
stigma and what it means for the 
crisis to be declared a national 
health emergency.”

Jay Lee, a general surgery 

resident at Michigan Medicine and 
part of the faculty participating 
in the session, is also part 
of the research team at the 
Michigan Opioid Prescribing and 
Engagement Network, in which he 
has investigated physicians’ role in 
the epidemic.

“In 2001, physicians embarked 

on a well-intentioned campaign 
to improve pain management for 
patients,” Lee said. “At the same 
time, pharmaceutical companies 
began 
aggressively 
marketing 

prescription opioids. The situation 
was further exacerbated by a 
study (Addiction Rare in Patients 
Treated with Narcotics), which, 
when taken out of context, seemed 

to suggest that becoming addicted 
to prescription opioids was very 
rare.”

Lee is also a researcher in 

many opioid studies that aim to 
understand the number of opioids 
needed after surgery, a factor in 
the growing amount of opioid 
dependence. 

“This information is critical to 

making opioid prescribing safer,” 
he said. “Prior to these studies, 
physicians could only guess about 
how much opioid a patient would 
need after surgery. This led to 
misuse of these medications and 
an abundance of leftover opioid 
pills in the community, which 
frequently end up in the hands of 
people with opioid addiction.”

Lee explained the teach-out 

will help integrate the public in the 
solution of the crisis.

“These will help people better 

understand 
the 
tremendous 

dangers of these medications, 
how to use them safely and how to 
dispose of leftover medications,” 
he said.

Rebecca 
Haffajee, 
an 

assistant professor of health and 

management policy, is also part of 
the teach-out’s faculty.

Haffajee said many policies 

have been put into place, like drug-
monitoring programs and pain 
clinic regulations, but more are still 
needed for stronger effects.

“We 
are 
still 
evaluating 

numerous policies, as well as 
piloting new ones, to tackle this 
crisis head-on without generating 
other public health unintended 
consequences — like reducing 
access 
to 
appropriate 
opioid 

prescribing 
or 
encouraging 

substitution 
from 
prescription 

opioids to illicit sources,” she said.

The teach-out will allow a 

platform 
for 
conversation 
on 

this topic and provoke some new 
thoughts in the public.

“We are aiming to reach 

diverse audiences through this 
teach-out, to provide views on 
the crisis from experts of varying 
fields 
and 
perspectives,” 
she 

said. 
“Since 
almost 
everyone 

has 
been 
personally 
affected 

by the opioid crisis, we all have 
something to contribute in terms 
of brainstorming solutions.”

of classes and subjects, Ilyas said 
he would like to see it become 
more accessible to undergraduate 
students by incorporating more 
connections to internships and jobs 
for the undergraduate level.

“It was a public health graduate 

program, so a lot of the internships 
and opportunities the school offers 
are for graduate students still,” 
he said. “They’re trying to shift 
it more to give opportunities to 
undergraduate students as well. It’s 
in the process, so I hope to see more 
of that next year.”

Harper also noted the need for 

an improvement in undergraduate 
internship 
opportunities. 
He 

explained while the school is 
currently exploring both domestic 
and global possibilities with which 
to connect students, the newness 
of the program is proving to be an 
obstacle in this area that has yet to 
be fully overcome.

“Since the School of Public Health 

has previously only worked with 
master’s and doctoral students, we 
haven’t had the resources to really 
identify and support undergraduate 
internships,” 
Harper 
said. 
“It 

would be great if we could start to 
see funding for internships. Right 
now, we don’t have the money in 
the budget.”

Harper said the school does have 

an individual from the Office for 
Student Engagement and Practice 
dedicated to working on exploring 
and expanding new internship 
opportunities.

Going forward, Harper hopes 

the school will be able to identify 
more internships for students 
and find ways to communicate 
those opportunities effectively. He 
said the school hopes to see more 
resources dedicated to supporting 
internship funding to help offset 
potential 
costs, 
especially 
for 

students interested in international 
internships, 
thereby 
increasing 

accessibility.

Reynolds, Ilyas and Harper all 

talked about professors and faculty 
as one of the main strengths of the 
program. The professors for the 
new undergraduate program are 
the same as those who teach the 
graduate program.

“We 
have 
amazing 
faculty 

teaching the classes,” Harper said. 
“They do a great job of bringing 
public health into the classroom. 
They bring examples of the work 
they’re doing out of the real world. 
To have a professor that not only 
talks about a particular public 
health intervention, but is actually 
doing this around the globe, that’s a 
unique experience you don’t always 
get to see.”

Because they all have hands-on 

experience in the field, Ilyas said, 
his professors have also been able 
to help give him direction by acting 
almost as mentors, discussing 
how they became involved with 
the work they do today and giving 
advice to students.

Reynolds added the diversity 

of 
professors’ 
backgrounds 

strengthens the diversity of classes. 
As they are all experts in their 
various fields, she said, they are 
able to teach and communicate very 

effectively about the topic. Reynolds 
said this wide range of classes has 
been helping her narrow her track 
as she explores different options.

“Even if I can’t physically take a 

class, I know that they exist,” she 
said. “There are some graduate 
student courses open to undergrads 
if we’re interested … some things 
you wouldn’t even think about, but 
you would want to know later in 
your career. You can take a class 
on obesity, a class on cancer, a class 
on biopathology. Every little niche 
is covered, so you have a lot of 
options.”

Emily Youatt, the managing 

director 
of 
the 
Office 
of 

Undergraduate Education at the 
School of Public Health, said 
students’ positive response to the 
Public Health faculty is not one-
sided. She said faculty, in turn, love 
being able to learn from interactions 
with undergraduate students and 
hear the new ideas they bring to 
public health.

“The students this fall have made 

a really positive impression on the 
faculty here, who for the most part 
had not taught undergraduates 
before and were a little timid 
about working with them,” she 
said. “The students have really 
shown themselves to be amazing 
— they’re so engaged, they’re 
so bright. They’re eager to ask 
questions that sometimes graduate 
students wouldn’t. They’re a little 
less inhibited, which makes for 
much more interesting classroom 
conversations than you might get at 
the master’s level.”

Youatt said because of this 

classroom 
interaction, 
faculty 

members are continually coming to 
her with new ideas for a class they 
would like to create and teach. She 
said a benefit of the program being 
brand new is there is always an 
opportunity to quickly incorporate 
these innovative ideas into the 
curriculum.

LSA sophomore Sydni Warner 

heard about the public health 
program from a friend in its first 
cohort. Because she was not sure 
what public health really was at 
the time, Warner attended an 
informational session to learn 
about public health as a whole and 
the 
University’s 
undergraduate 

program in particular.

“I liked the policy side of public 

health and the behind the scenes 
work that goes into it,” Warner said. 
“I think patterns of disease and 
disease is really interesting, so the 
epidemiology part especially I just 
fell in love with … I decided, ‘OK, 
this is what I want.’”

Reynolds 
also 
encouraged 

prospective students to consider the 
public health program, regardless 
of whether they’ve always had an 
interest in the field or it’s entirely 
unknown to them.

“For people that don’t know 

what public health is — either they 
haven’t heard of it or don’t know 
what it does — they should really 
look into it if they value public 
service and think they could lend 
a hand in any way,” she said. “If 
you’re interested in medicine, 
if you’re interested in politics, if 
you’re interested in biology, there’s 
a place for you in public health and 
you could find something you really 
love here.”

Jansohn said. “I was wondering 
why they didn’t tell us to leave. 
If they didn’t tell us to leave, 
then I guess it was probably 

fine.”

South Quad resident Amin 

Tonmoy, an LSA freshman, said 
he also asked officers he saw in 
his hall.

“The 
chances 
of 
this 

happening seem pretty low, 
but it’s still pretty scary,” he 

said. “He’s hiding and the 
police are after him, so I still 
feel okay (because) the police 
are right here. Knowing if he’s 
been found or not will be very 
helpful.”

Both said they hoped for 

more 
communication 
and 

clarity on the case moving 
forward, but recognized the 
complications in securing the 
scenes.

“I don’t feel nervous going 

back to West (Quad) because 
no one told me to be nervous,” 
Jansohn said.

Councilmember 
Sumi 

Kailasapathy, D-Ward 1, urged 
the man and others like him 
to stop and think about the 
lifetime impact a development 
like this would cast upon each 
resident.

“Coming from a Third-World 

country, this really bothers 
me because this is what the 
World Bank and IMF would tell 
Third-World people … ‘You’ll 
suffer in the short run, but 

your economy is going to grow 
so much you’ll be thankful for 
us,’” said Kailasapathy, who 
was a refugee from Sri Lanka.

NIMBY, or “Not In My 

BackYard,” 
is 
a 
pejorative 

term for people who oppose 
unpleasant projects in their own 
neighborhoods but will readily 
hand other neighborhoods the 
same burden.

That 
being 
said 

Councilmember 
Chuck 

Warpehoski, 
D-Ward 
4, 

criticized opposition for not 
having a coherent alternative 
vision for what to do with the 
land.

“This 
inconsistency, 
this 

lack of a voice, I’m hearing 
many 
completely 
different 

things from even the residents 
makes me highly skeptical that 
there’s a possibility to have a 
coherent negotiating position,” 
Warpehoski said.

In the end, the motion to 

change the zoning passed, with 
Kailasapathy, Anne Bannister, 
D-Ward 1; Jane Lumm, I-Ward 
2; and Jack Eaton, D-Ward 4, 
dissenting. Mayor Chris Taylor 
praised the decision, saying it is 
a positive step toward creating 
a more walkable Ann Arbor.

“(Lower Town) is going to 

be a part of our town that will 
be changed substantially over 
the next couple of years, and 
I believe that these changes 
will ultimately be difficult but 
… I believe it will be better for 
community,” Taylor said.

Council also voted to approve 

the city’s winter 2018 deer 
management plan, which aims 
to kill 250 deer and sterilize 
does on a mass scale. The new 
plan has brought controversy 
as the city eliminated the rule 
in which a sharpshooter cannot 
shoot within a 450-foot radius 
of an occupied building or 
home.

These ideas that 
we need more 
growth in the 
economy was 
really a priority


T

oday, many people say 
America is more divided 
than ever. We see it in 

our discourse, the slurs thrown 
at one another, the struggle for 
moral high ground and even 
the violence in our streets. 
When I see this, I lament the 
lack of interest in nuanced 
conversation and appreciation 
for context in every discussion. 
I welcome and continue to 
engage with truly different 
perspectives from my own. 

Though, when I do try to 

reach across the aisle to my more 
conservative friends, the complex 
personalization of our discourse 
and reliance on platitudes has 
made me realize that why we 
have 
different 
viewpoints, 

particularly in how we view the 
role of government, is unclear. 
There lie the age-old questions 
we saw during the Constitutional 
Convention: How large should 
the federal government be and, 
more importantly, how should 
one define its role? Through my 
conversations, I began to think a 
lot about what our government’s 
role should be, and I think the 
answer might lie in how we should 
approach issues like abortion.

As 
I 
have 
written 
about 

previously, I am a practicing 
Catholic. Many of my family 
friends are consistently single-
issue voters on a pro-life view. 
Though I am a moderate liberal, I 
have come to the conclusion that I 
am both pro-life and pro-choice. 
Now don’t be confused: This isn’t, 
and shouldn’t be, perceived as a 
black-and-white issue.

If I were sitting at an abortion 

clinic, discussing with my partner 
if we should consider getting an 
abortion, I would strongly lobby 
against doing so. This is because 
my decision would be based on my 
personal beliefs as a Catholic and 
someone who sees life separate 
from consciousness. Now this is 
all predicated on the notion that 
I was given the choice between 
moving forward in the procedure 
or stopping it.

However, when approaching 

policy, matters of reproduction 
and intimacy are, as Tim Kaine 
(a “traditional Catholic”) explains 
“moral decisions for individuals to 
make for themselves.” And this is 
just it: I should not develop policy 
simply based on my personal 
identities and issues. If I were a 
politician, I would approach my 

issues through logic and rationale, 
entirely separate from my identity 
as a Catholic or any other personal 
identity. Since we work as a 
society dependent on common 
ground, my identities should not 
be the entire basis for rationale in 
a political sphere, and nor should 
the id be a guiding principle in 
policy development.

Therefore, I arrive at this 

question: Is abortion a right or 
is the right based on the choice 
between receiving or not receiving 
an abortion? I would think it 
is the latter. This is where, I 
posit, we arrive at this notion 
of government: Its defining role 
(other than protecting the public) 
is to offer the easiest access of 
choice to the general population, 
which upon given a range of 
options, can then incorporate their 
personal identities and beliefs. 
This isn’t just for abortions; it 
should be for guns, health care 
and a variety of other issues. This 
is why pro-choice should exist: 
so that there is an even playing 
field and the decision for the best 
course of action can be left up to 
the couple or individual.

However, is the playing field 

actually even? Well, as abortion 
clinics are increasingly closing 
their doors, one can easily make 
the case that in some states, the 
playing field is not equal. Though 
much of this can be attributed 
to pro-life movements within 
state legislatures, I do question 
the general role of government in 
funding. One comment I hear my 
conservative friends (men and 
women) say is that they shouldn’t 
have to pay taxes that subsidize 
abortions.

Though I might disagree on 

the notion that their personal 
identities as a part of a particular 
religious group should influence 
their decision, I recognize, in a 
light similar to Citizens United, 
that their money is “donated” 
against their free speech to support 
a procedure they vehemently 
oppose. They should not have to 
give money to an organization 
that directly contradicts their very 
sense of self, as if they are “forced” 
to “donate” to such an effort.

Say ideally, then, these abortion 

clinics weren’t closing. The next 
question we should ask is: since it 
is the government’s responsibility 
to offer an ease of options to the 
individual, whether, if some tax 
dollars were removed from the 

funding of such programs, the 
ease of options for the individual 
would significantly decrease. It is 
well-documented that 49 percent 
of people who seek abortions are 
below the poverty level, obviously 
unable to pay up to $1,500 for an 
abortion. But how do you confound 
the fact that these individuals who 
are pro-life are paying taxes to 
subsidize abortions?

Last year, Planned Parenthood 

made a net income of $77.5 million, 
with 41 percent of its revenue (the 
largest amount) coming from the 
government: mostly through Title 
X and Medicare. It is important 
to recognize that only about 3 
percent of the budget goes to 
abortion 
services. 
Complete 

removal of federal funding would 
significantly skew the playing 
field, since private donations only 
constitute 33 percent. The choice 
would be forced by lack of access: 
It should be entirely based on 
one’s personal beliefs, context and 
ideology.

While this means there might be 

issues leveling the “playing field,” 
it certainly seeks to balance that 
with not having those staunchly 
against abortions pay taxes to 
that go toward these services. 
Obviously, abortion clinics could 
work simply based on donation 
and external affiliates; I would 
suggest that government stay 
entirely out of the debate entirely. 
Nevertheless, the solution, in my 
mind, can be only two-fold: that 
government remove itself entirely 
or we have to accept that the 
ability to choose is part of a social 
contract everyone has to accept.

I would argue, given the 

former is certainly more difficult 
in maintaining this balance, the 
latter is the only solution at this 
moment. Moreover, when taking 
into account only 3 percent of 
Planned 
Parenthood’s 
work 

(328,348 total) is abortion services, 
I can better reconcile this notion. 
I recognize my decision is based 
only in the event of such an issue. 
My intent isn’t, and shouldn’t be, 
to impose personal identity on the 
decision process of others. The 
foremost priority is to maintain 
the balance of choice, then in a 
predicament where an abortion is 
contemplated, personal identity 
may enter.

E

very Friday for as long 
as I can remember, I’ve 
concluded my day with 

a phone call to my Ammamma. 
While drinking her Madras coffee, 
she fills me in on the latest family 
gossip, and I reassure her that 
I’m well-fed and well-read, and 
update her on my newest futile 
attempt at preparing an Indian 
meal. This week, however, our 
routine spiels were interrupted 
by the incessant drilling outside 
her home in the HITEC city 
neighborhood of Hyderabad. Upon 
my inquiry, she revealed to me 
that the construction was due to 
preparations for Ivanka Trump’s 
upcoming visit to the city. 

A couple of hours of Googling 

later, 
I 
learned 
that 
the 
first 
daughter 

would be visiting India toward the 
end of November to speak at the 
Global Entrepreneurship Summit. 
The summit, which will be hosted 
in South Asia for the first time, is 
set to host 1,500 entrepreneurs and 
world leaders from 150 countries. 

Preliminary efforts for the event 

have included extensive renovation 
to the city’s pothole-ridden roads, 
the hasty construction of an 
extravagant pedestrian shopping 
mall 
and, 
most 
significantly, 

the extraction of thousands of 
homeless civilians from public 
view.

Hyderabad, known as the IT 

hub and economic powerhouse of 
South India, is the fourth-most-
populated city in the country, 
with an estimated 13 percent of 
its population living below the 
national poverty line. The city’s 
attempt to rebrand itself as the 
Silicon Valley of India in recent 
years has brought in companies 
such 
as 
Apple, 
Google 
and 

Microsoft; nevertheless, economic 
inequality has increased. For many 
living in slum neighborhoods, 
begging serves as the predominant 
means for survival. 

In one week alone, over 400 

individuals caught begging were 
transported to separate male and 
female housing facilities, located 
on the grounds of two city prisons. 
Begging is listed as a criminal 
offense in the region; however, 
the law is rarely, if ever, enforced. 
When asked about the correlation 
of Trump’s visit and the sudden 
relocation initiative, V.K Singh, 

the director of Hyderabad’s prison 
system, insisted that this has 
been a mission of the government 
for several years due to the 
“annoyance and awkwardness” 
of begging in Indian cities. An 
estimated 
6,000 
people 
are 

expected to be taken into these 
“rehabilitation facilities” prior 
to the summit, and city officials 
have stated that individuals will 
be offered a shower, bed and pair 
of clean clothes.

While this may sound altruistic, 

many of these individuals are 
separated 
from 
their 
family 

members prior to being taken to 
a respective shelter. Moreover, 
everyone 
brought 
into 
a 

temporary housing facility will 
be fingerprinted under police 
supervision prior to their release 
with the threat of incarceration, 
should they be caught asking for 
money again. 

The summit, ironically titled, 

“Women 
First, 
Prosperity 

for All,” is not the first time 
impoverished locals have been 
characterized as blemishes and 
concealed 
from 
international 

visitors. Hyderabad took similar 
measures in 2000 in preparation 
for former then-President Bill 
Clinton’s visit. Ten years later, 
before the 2010 Commonwealth 
games in New Delhi, bulldozers 
tore through Delhi’s expansive 
blue-tent 
neighborhoods 
that 

served as homes for the city’s 
millions of homeless families 
with no relocation plan set 
in 
motion. 
Comparably, 
in 

China, 
government 
officials 

pushed thousands of migrant 
workers caught seeking work 
opportunities in the city center to 
the outskirts of Beijing to present 
a more sanitized and affluent 
metroplex for the 2008 Olympics.

Trump spoke on a world stage 

about the importance of changing 
government policies in ways that 
empower 
women 
to 
produce 

healthier economies; meanwhile, 
her visit prompted the temporary 
lockdown of these very women 
with no sustainable plans for 
when they are asked to leave the 
rehabilitation facilities. 

Uprooting 
impoverished 

citizens and criminalizing poverty 
is not only ethically unsettling, 
it’s insufficient in moving toward 

any kind of attempt at poverty 
eradication. Many of Hyderabad’s 
homeless have been stuck in the 
vicious cycle of impoverishment 
for generations. The challenge 
becomes even more convoluted 
when you consider the multitude 
of circumstances that lead to 
homelessness in the first place. 
Pervasiveness of the caste system, 
lack of education opportunities 
for women and the overwhelming 
stigma associated with physical 
disablements 
and 
mental 

illnesses all play a role in pushing 
individuals to begging.

It is imperative to emphasize 

that this crisis isn’t isolated to 
the Western Hemisphere. New 
York City’s notoriously strained 
relationship with homelessness 
is evident by the 60,000-plus 
individuals shifting in between 
temporary 
housing 
clusters. 

Correspondingly, in Los Angeles, 
the number of individuals living on 
the streets jumped by 23 percent in 
the last year alone. In these cities, 
a combination of factors, most 
significantly skyrocketing rents, 
has exacerbated the issue.

What’s even more daunting is 

that, similarly to India, the threat 
of incarceration looms over these 
vulnerable populations. Though 
many urban hubs, like New 
York City and Los Angeles, have 
attempted to increase the number 
of distributable resources for the 
homeless, a study found that 53 
percent of these cities continue to 
ban sitting or lying in public places.

Closer to home, in Detroit, 

homelessness 
has 
actually 

decreased 
by 
20 
percent. 

Michigan’s “housing first” policy, 
implemented in 2015, is largely 
attributed for this accomplishment, 
as the policy called for funding in 
permanent housing and social work 
initiatives to enable individuals to 
live sustainably. Detroit’s numbers 
support the abundance of evidence 
that indicates investments in long-
term subsidized housing, alongside 
mental health and other social 
service initiatives, are needed 
to benefit those facing the harsh 
reality of homelessness.

Power in a platform

NATALIE BROWN | NATALIE CAN BE REACHED AT NGBROWN@UMICH.EDU

I

’ve never been good at lasts. 
They’re hard to process in 
the moment, pulling me to 

either the most emotional end of 
the reaction spectrum or leaving 
me to stew in my own fabricated 
indifference. 
Balance 
clearly 

isn’t a strong suit of mine, either.

It makes sense then, that as 

I sat down to write this article 
— my last for the semester — I 
had absolutely no idea where 
to begin. There’s so much to 
say about the current campus 
climate — white supremacist 
Richard 
Spencer’s 
possible 

future 
appearance 
at 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan, 

dialogues 
surrounding 

divestment, the Middle Eastern 
and North African community’s 
campaign to create a ME/
NA demographic category on 
campus forms. These are things 
I’ve been thinking long and 
hard about, things that matter 
with a magnitude of pressing 
urgency. Things that affect 
the day-to-day mental states 
of others to an extent I can’t 
possibly fathom as an upper-
middle-class white woman.

As I scroll through The 

Daily’s fiery op-eds and the 
eloquently worded columns of 
my fellow opinionators, I’m hit 
with an overwhelming feeling of 
gratitude. I’m grateful that this 
school is home to such a well-
run student publication that 
strives to give voices to many, 
maintaining self-awareness in 
its shortcomings. I’m grateful 
for the power journalism can 
have when its very existence 
rests on the cultivation of social 
responsibility, the discourse it 
can encourage in these select 
scenarios. And here’s a really 
broad sentiment: I’m grateful for 
words, for the people who use 
them to initiate positive social 
change 
and 
to 
demonstrate 

vulnerability. 
I’m 
grateful 

for language that empowers, 
that 
interrogates 
and 
that 

re-interrogates societal norms 
while exploring the stories of 
both individuals and the masses.

Simultaneously, I’m hit with a 

thought about what it means to 
write for a student publication 
like this one. Have I deserved 
the platform that I’ve been 
given, an inexperienced writer 
with 
semi-minimal 
campus 

involvement and no experiences 
of marginalization? It seems I 
may have shirked some of my 
own social responsibilities as 
a columnist with the privilege 
of white skin and a public 
platform. A self-titled “health 
and wellness” columnist for the 
semester, I’ve limited myself 
to columns that veer from the 
rigorous risk-taking and opinion-
stating of many of my peers.

Maybe I was afraid of my 

own inexperience, that I might 
not know how to navigate these 
more complex issues in a totally 
productive way. My failure to 
use this platform to do so over 
the course of the semester is, 
essentially, the definition of 
privilege. I’m not proud of this in 
the slightest, but it’s something 
for which I’m accountable.

However, I will say I don’t 

think this platform should be 
grounds 
for 
experimentation 

with discussions around such 
tough topics either. If I did 
approach these more socially 
charged issues in my columns, 
I wanted to be sure that my 
responses demonstrated 750 to 
1,000 words of intellectual rigor, 
of consciously chosen language 
and moral responsibility.

But regardless, the fact is that 

I didn’t really use this platform 
to create careful meditations on 
polarizing issues. I pretty much 
stayed within my comfort zone 
and rested on the more classical 
definitions of the “health and 
wellness” label I’d originally 
adopted at the beginning of the 
semester, without weaving this 
topic into the context of current 
events on campus.

Upon reflection, this seems 

irresponsible. Especially in light 
of this country’s era of Donald 
Trump, the combination of 
privilege and a platform should 

be enough to hold myself to a 
high standard of accountability 
for discussing these pressing 
issues, no matter the level of 
publicity my articles might be 
receiving.

And what of the gratitude I feel 

for the power of the University’s 
student publications, anyway? I 
mean, it’s an easy gratitude for 
me to personally feel. I have the 
ability to sit back and watch as 
productive discourse unfolds, 
catalyzed by articles I more than 
likely did not write. The content 
addressed by the more socially 
responsible articles will not 
affect my own safety on campus. 
It will not affect the ease with 
which I can get my voice heard at 
the University the way it might 
affect that of some of my friends 
and classmates.

Contemplating 
my 
own 

reasons for applying to be a 
columnist this semester, I do 
wonder: “Were they valid ones?” 
I’ve never been great at sharing 
my writing or expressing my 
opinions, and I guess I wanted to 
“challenge” myself — of course, 
I should’ve moved further past 
this original comfort zone and 
into some more commentary 
on timely campus occurrences. 
I think I was given a platform, 
and I don’t think I utilized it in a 
totally productive way.

I think about laziness and 

poor planning, how some of 
my columns were written to 
meet deadlines rather than to 
commit to a standard of social 
responsibility. I think about 
privilege and the power of 
a platform, how I’m a white 
person 
who 
gets 
to 
self-

interrogate on this page while 
many important voices and 
stories remain unheard.

I have a long way to go until 

I can say that I’m standing as 
tall as possible on the platform 
I’ve been given.

COURTESY OF A24

Greta Gerwig talks ‘Lady 
Bird’ and growing up

Greta Gerwig has hit the ground 

running 
with 
her 
directorial 

debut in “Lady Bird.” A vaguely 
autobiographical 
comedy-

drama about teen angst in 2002 
Sacramento, 
Gerwig 
illustrates 

a mother-daughter relationship 
that has already captured several 
awards, earned a record-shattering 
100 percent ‘Fresh’ rating on Rotten 
Tomatoes with over 180 reviews 
and started Oscar rumblings. The 
numbers don’t lie: “Lady Bird” is a 
stunning film that takes everything 
cliché about cinema and turns it 
into something special. And it’s 
been nothing but a success for 
Gerwig, who has broken out of her 
acting role (“Mistress America,” 
“Frances Ha”) to prove that she 
can really do it all. And how? 
Well, those are the questions she 
answered in a phone interview 
with The Daily:

***

How long did you have the 

story of “Lady Bird” floating 
around before it was produced? 
When did you start to convert 
your vision into a film?

I spent a couple of years writing 

the movie. It always takes me a long 
time to write and it’s my process. 
And it’s because once I’m on set, I 
don’t do any improvisation. And 
once I had a good draft of the film, 
I decided to have it be this thing 
that would be my directorial debut. 
And then after that, it took another 
year to get financing and get going. 
So it was really, from the first 
time I started writing it to being 
in production, about three years. 
And then it took a year after that to 
finish editing it and bringing into 
the world. So filmmaking is a long 
process, but it’s a very rewarding 
one.

One thing that really warmed 

my heart was that “Lady Bird” 
was a very mother-daughter 
centric 
film. 
Did 
coming-

of-age cinema influence the 
development of Lady Bird?

Well, I was thinking about a lot 

of the different films that deal with 
both coming-of-age and growing 
up and occupying personal identity. 
And I wanted to make a film that 
was both one person’s coming-
of-age and another person letting 
go. And I wanted it to be as much 
about the adults as it was about the 
teenagers.

And in particular, I guess I was 

thinking about the films that to me 
have to do with not just childhood 
but also memory, like Fellini’s 
“Amarcord” or Truffaut’s “400 
Blows.” Films that are both about 
childhood and about the loss of 
childhood.

Do you think “Lady Bird” 

will have that same effect on 
someone that feels they live in a 
place of cultural insignificance 
and they need to leave — that 
their life will start once they go 
to New York or L.A.?

I hope it does. I hope that it 

connects to people who are from 
the cities that are less documented 
than in a New York or L.A. or San 
Francisco, or Chicago. Because I’m 
interested in those cities and those 
stories and those places. I think 
there’s a lot of richness there and a 
lot of things that we don’t get to see 
and that’s what I’m always looking 
for when I go to the movie theater 
and hope that in a way someone 
will watch this and feel like they 

can make a film about the place 
that they’re in and not feel like they 
have to leave in order to make their 
artistic statement.

The music in the film was very 

influential to the entire story. 
What went into choosing the 
specific music that you did of 
the time period and whittling it 
down to the certain songs that 
you actually ended up choosing 
in the film for it?

Music is such an important 

part of what I think it means to 
be a teenager and how you form 
your identity, and your taste, and 
imagining an adult life for yourself. 
And so I was very careful about 
the music that I chose in the movie 
because I didn’t want it to just 
be music from the year 2002, I 
wanted it to have music from the 
’90s, because in 2002, it’s before 
the streaming and all the other 
stuff, and you really got your music 
from the radio and people were 
still playing the hits from 10 years 
earlier or seven years earlier on 
the radio. So that was important 
to me. And I would be remiss not 
to mention my collaborator (John 
Brian), who wrote the music for the 
movie; I wanted it to feel like it was 
pop music at the time that teenagers 
would listen to, and that it also had 
this old-fashioned movie score. 
That combination was something 
that I was very interested in 
capturing. I was so lucky that he 
was willing to collaborate with me 
on that, and then also that all these 
artists gave their permission to use 
the music.

2017 feels like the year of 

the woman director — why is it 
that this coming-of-age story, 
that’s focused more on the 
female experience, would be so 
important?

Well, I agree with you; I think 

that this year has been an amazing 
year for women in film. I think that 
the directors who’ve had films this 
year whether it’s a big blockbuster 
like Patty Jenkins with “Wonder 
Woman” or Angelina Jolie (with 
“First They Killed My Father”), or 
Maggie Betts with “Novitiate,” or 
Dee Rees with “Mudbound”; it’s 
just an extraordinary year and to 
be part of that conversation is very 
meaningful to me.

And I think in a way, the story 

is a story that is so universal. But 
because there’s been a lack of female 
creators that it’s one that’s less 
documented than male coming-
of-age. I love male coming-of-age 
stories and I have nothing against 
them, but I’m always interested to 
see what the female version of that 
is, like what is “Boyhood,” but for a 
girl? What is the “400 Blows” but 
for a girl? And I felt that I had not 
seen that as much as I wanted to. So 
I wanted to make something that 
was about not only a young woman 
but about a mother and a family 
and a place.

As a female filmmaker, do you 

feel like there’s an expectation 
portrayed in this relationship, 
and how do you portray these 
relationships realistically for all 
of their complexity and nuance?

Well, I’ve made it a goal as a 

writer and now as a director to 
tell stories about women that the 
primary emotional relationship is 
one between two women. And in 
this movie, it’s between a mother 
and a daughter.

I don’t feel pressured to tell 

those stories. If anything, I feel like 
they’re stories that are somewhat 
harder to get made or ‘green lit’ 
because they’re not — they don’t 
have a genre. But I think they’re 
important to tell because I think 

that these windows into the lives of 
girls and women, to steal a phrase 
from Alice Munro, that we don’t 
get to see if there aren’t female 
writer, directors and creators.

So for me, I love doing it and I 

don’t suspect that I will only make 
films about that. I’m sure I’ll make 
a lot of other films. But it was a 
deliberate thing on my part. And 
then in terms of making it realistic, 
I think I never want to turn away 
from the darkness, but I also don’t 
want to make villains, ever, with 
my characters. So I don’t try to 
present perfect people, nor do I 
ever want my filmmaking to take 
my characters down. I want them 
to be allowed to be flawed and to 
be loved.

“Lady Bird” has been getting 

so much media attention for 
being so critically acclaimed, 
with 100% on Rotten Tomatoes 
and everything. What’s it like 
to have such a personal film 
that’s also your debut be so well-
received?

It’s amazing to have it be 

received like this. Because I know 
how much love and care and effort 
every single person who worked 
on this film put into it, and that’s 
from all of the casts and the crew 
and the production team to our 
distributors, A24. Everyone has 
pulled so hard for the film and put 
so much into it and to get that love 
back is just extraordinary. It’s also 
completely intimidating but it’s 
great. It’s a good intimidation.

When so many films put 

romance at the center stage, 
what was it about friendship 
rather than romance that you 
thought was more interesting to 
tell?

Well, I love romance just as 

much as the next person, and I 
certainly love romance in movies. 
But I think romance, especially 
heterosexual romance, has got a 
lot of great movies. We’ve got a 
lot of good ones about that. And I 
didn’t feel that it was particularly 
for me at that moment. It felt like 
I was interested in emotional 
relationships that were just as deep 
and vivid and filled with love and 
complexity, but that aren’t just 
heterosexual romance.

And I like taking things that are 

cliché and putting them in another 
capacity. Like, for example, when 
her mom drives back to see here 
at the airport, everybody knows 
the scene and the romance where 
someone circles back and runs 
through an airport to find someone 
they love. That tends to be between 
a man and a woman. And I wanted 
to take that cliché but make it 
between a mother and a daughter

LITTLE STONES

‘Little Stones’ returns to 
Ann Arbor with a twist

The University of Michigan’s 

School of Education will be 
screening 
the 
award-winning 

documentary 
“Little 
Stones,” 

directed by Sophia Kruz, an alum 
of the University. The film finds its 
way back to Ann Arbor, after being 
released in March of this year, but 
this time with an exciting twist. 
Kruz, in conjunction with Darin 
Stockdill, the design coordinator 
for the School of Education’s Center 
for Education Design, Evaluation 
and Research, and the School of 
Education, will host a workshop 
for teachers to debut a curriculum 
used in conjunction with the film 
in both schools and communities 
nationwide. 

“Little Stones” is a documentary 

that features four women in 
different 
third-world 
countries 

who use the arts to fight against 
gender inequality in their country. 
Indeed, the documentary tells the 
story of Panmela Castro, a graffiti 
artist using her craft to speak 
out against domestic violence 
in Brazil; Sohini Chakraborty, a 
woman in India who uses dance 
to help victims of self trafficking 
reclaim their bodies; Fatou Diatta, 
aka Sister Fa, a Senegalese rapper 
using hip hop and rap to speak 
out about the practice of genital 
mutilation in West Africa and 

Anna Taylor, an American fashion 
designer who gives impoverished 
women in Kenya jobs making 
high-fashion clothing. Kruz, in an 
interview with The Daily asked, 
“Who doesn’t like art? I think that 
(there is an) inherent humanity in 
art that draws people in a builds 
community, and you can channel 
that positive energy into fruition.”

This documentary strives to go 

beyond a simple screening by giving 
its viewers solutions and tools 
to become more educated in the 
matters presented in the film and 
ways that its viewers can become 
active in the dialogue against 
gender violence internationally.

“I think it’s so important to tell 

not just stories about the problems, 

but to tell stories about solutions so 
you can inspire people, and then 
once people are inspired to find 
ways that they can get help,” Kruz 
said. “Everyone has something 
that they’re good at. It may not be 
graffiti, but it might be you’re a 
really good chef and you care a lot 
about refugee issues. So you could 
be hosting dinners for refugees in 
your community.”

The 
creative 
team 
now 

announces their new addition to 
the documentary: an educational 
toolkit, which will be presented 
during a teacher development 
workshop 
at 
the 
School 
of 

Education on Dec. 9.

The educational toolkit was 

developed by Stockdill and a team 
of two undergraduate students and 
a high school student. It includes 
three parts: a curriculum geared 
toward high school students, one 
geared toward a larger community 
setting and a third section that 
serves as a resource for those who 
want to take further action.

“It’s a very powerful and moving 

film. It has great potential to be 
interesting and engaging and 
entertaining, at the same time, it 
is very educational and it has a lot 
of potential to develop student’s 
thinking about an important topic: 
gender-based violence,” Stockdill 
said.

FILM INTERVIEW

PREVIEW

I hope that it 

connects to people 

who are from 

the cities that are 
less documented 

than in a New 
York or L.A. or 
San Francisco, 

or Chicago. 

and transform it that way.

Many 
of 
the 
characters 

in 
“Lady 
Bird” 
have 

autobiographical 
similarities, 

but they’re not exactly the 
same as your own story. Can 
you talk a little bit more about 
writing from your own personal 
experiences?

I always start from a place of 

something that I know where it’s 
close to my heart. And with this 
movie, I wanted to write about 
Sacramento because I’m from 
Sacramento. And I wanted to write 
about Catholic schools because I’ve 
been to Catholic school for high 
school.

But I find this: It’s almost always 

they (the stories) start with some 
kernel that’s real and then very 
quickly the characters spin out and 
become their own people and the 
events of the film have their own 
shape and form that’s outside of the 
events of my life.

And I think for me, it’s more, 

the impetus is starting from a 
place of familiarity and letting 
that be the thing that allows me 
to invent. It might not always be 
that way in my writing, but that’s 
sort of where it tends to begin. 
But it takes very odd paths and 
I think someone in the product, 
people might think that there are 
things that autobiographical that 
aren’t, and they might think that 
something is invented which is 
actually autobiographical. Because 
I’m not just writing one character, 
I’m writing a lot of characters. So 
sometimes I’ll hide a little piece 
of something that I know is real 
in a character that you wouldn’t 
suspect and things like that.

I 
like 
filmmaking 
that’s 

personal, I like writing that’s 
personal. And whether or not it’s 
actually real is it’s not in my case. 
But it’s never mattered to me as an 
audience member, or as a reader, 
or as a consumer of arts, what 
the connection was to the actual 
autobiography. It always seems to 
be separate to me.

What advice do you have 

for people that might feel that 

same way as Lady Bird: not 
directionless, but having so 
many directions they’d like to go 
but can’t decide?

I think when you’re 17, like Lady 

Bird is 17, I don’t know that many 
17-year-olds with a very clear 
direction. I mean, they’re always 
the ones who are great athletes or 
they know exactly what they want 
to do, but I think the vast majority of 
17-year-olds are figuring it out. And 
I don’t think that’s an indication of 
they’re never going to do anything. 
I think that’s an indication of being 
open and curious and looking for 
what the things will be.

I think in terms of picking a 

direction, I think this is something 
another writer said, Elizabeth 
Gilbert, in her book about writing. 
She said you’re always — you always 
are going to be okay if you just 
follow your curiosity. Sometimes 
people say follow your passion. 
But she said that’s a very difficult 
thing to do. What if you don’t have 
a passion? That’s a pretty tall order, 
to follow your passion.

But if you follow your curiosity, 

the worst thing that could happen 
is you live a life investigating your 
curiosities and even if you never 
find a passion, it doesn’t mean that 
you haven’t had a very interesting 
life.

What’s your process like in 

creating all these characters 
that felt so relatable?

I think one of the reasons that 

I’m interested in dramatic writing, 
in writing that is going to be said 
by actors, whether it’s in theater 
which is my first love, or now in 
cinema, which is my adult love, 
is that I’m always interested in 
the way words fail us and the way 
that we use language not to say 
what we mean. I think people do 
that all the time. And I think I’m 
always interested in the language 
underneath the language.

And so many of the scenes with 

“Lady Bird” and her mom, I mean 
her mom wants to tell her “I’m 
so scared” and she can’t say that 
because it’s hard to say what you’re 
actually feeling particularly when 

that feeling is fear. So you say a lot 
of other things. You say that your 
role is not picked up, or you say that 
— you fix it on something else.

And I think so much of who I am 

as a writer is a person who likes to 
listen. And I think one of the things 
that’s great about New York, is that 
you’re always in this circumstance 
where it’s very easy to listen to 
people talk.

And mostly people use language 

to not say what they mean at all. 
And I’m always fascinated by that. 
And I think one of the reasons for 
me that the ending is so moving is 
that “Lady Bird” is finally able to 
use her language to say what she 
means and she means that thank 
you and she says thank you.

Are you surprised by how 

universal 
the 
Sacramento 

experience seems like it is based 
on how well “Lady Bird” is 
doing?

Yes! 
I 
mean, 
it 
is 
really 

extraordinary because I’ve always 
been a believer in the more specific 
you make something, the more 
universal it will be. So I didn’t want 
to make it any town. I wanted to 
make it this town and this people 
and these people. Because I think 
the truth is that through that 
specificity, people would have a 
greater likelihood of connecting 
to their own life and their own 
hometown and their own families 
and where they’re from and 
where they’re going. And I didn’t 
expect though how much so many 
people would say to me I’ve never 
been to Sacramento, but I have a 
Sacramento in my heart. And it 
makes me incredibly pleased and 
also it’s also kind of incredible that 
everybody can understand it.

But I think that, you know, that’s 

always been this thing that I love 
about movies, is they could take 
you into world you’ve never been in 
and you’ll never be able to go in and 
you feel like you know it.

SALVATORE DIGIOIA/DAILY ARTS WRITER

Greta Van Fleet worthy 
of ‘Talk on the Street’

Ask any kid on campus who was 

raised on classic rock who their 
favorite upcoming artist is. I can 
almost guarantee they’ll tell you 
Greta Van Fleet.

A friend of mine recently took 

a networking trip to Los Angeles 
with a music-oriented student 
organization. According to him, 
our excitement is shared with 
record label executives and talent 
agents alike.

It may seem strange for a 

Frankenmuth-raised 
group 
of 

twenty-somethings 
to 
be 
the 

music industry’s most talked-
about newcomer. Yet, Greta Van 
Fleet has been earning endless 
attention for lead-singer Josh 
Kiszka’s unmistakable similarity 
to Led Zeppelin frontman Robert 
Plant. His twin brothers, Jake 
and Sam, contribute to the shtick 
by donning shoulder-length hair 
as they play electrifying guitar 
and bass by his side and, along 
with drummer Danny Wagner, 
they recently released a highly-
acclaimed double-EP, From The 
Fires, through Lava and Republic 
Records. Despite half of the 
project’s songs being covers, its 
accompanying tour is sold out in 
all 14 cities, including three late-
December stops in Michigan (two 
in Detroit, one in Grand Rapids) 
upon which the band will conclude 
its current United States run. 
Something about this band has 
people chatting.

On Thursday, Nov 30th, I arrived 

in Chicago for the first of this tour’s 
14 shows and rushed promptly to 
the 500-person capacity Lincoln 
Hall to assure my credentials were 
in order. Outside, dozens of gray-
haired men awaited strangers 
who 
they’d 
negotiated 
with 

online to bypass the venue’s strict 
no-scalping policy, so naturally, the 
atmosphere was plagued by their 
fatherly conversations. For two 
hours, only half distracted by craft 
beers from the venue’s tiny bar, I 
suffered through proud quips like, 
“I haven’t been this certain about 
a band since I saw The Black Keys 
play back in 2005!” Clearly, the 
crowd wasn’t new to this.

Around 
eight 
o’clock, 
the 

crowd’s eagerness was (slightly) 
relieved by opening act Skywalker 
Man, a quirky group of piano, 

acoustic guitar and brass whose 
hipster, 
whispering 
frontman 

(using an antique telephone as a 
microphone, mind you) bore an 
uncanny resemblance to Ezra 
Koenig 
of 
Vampire 
Weekend 

(particularly on “We Both Have 
Nothing To Fear”). Skywalker 
proved, quite predictably, to be 
more indie than rock ‘n’ roll, an 
ironic pick for the sole opening 
act of a band boasting retroactive 
flare. I mainly used their time-slot 
to secure a front-row spot on the 
floor. Judging from those around 
me, such indifference was far from 
rare.

An hour later, the stage was 

finally cleared for its headliner, 
the venue at its maximum (though 
miniature) capacity, with one 
spotlight dramatically illuminating 
a logo on the head of the bass 
drum: “Greta Van Fleet,” written 
in the famous font of Netflix’s 
“Stranger Things” series. As band 
members took the stage, cloaked 
in carefully-selected floral blouses 
over 
skin-tight 
leather 
pants 

that 
aesthetically 
complement 

their 1970s sound, dozens of 
photographers 
finessed 
their 

ways towards the brothers. Their 
urgency offered a fleeting symbol 
of the band’s still-promising buzz, 
yet it was outdone by the few over-
ecstatic female fans who promptly 
followed suit to plea for a glance 
from the Kishkas.

Greta Van Fleet opened with 

“Talk On The Street,” an explosive 
jam that immediately shocked the 
room awake and allowed Jake and 
Sam to flex their superstar skills 
on strings. Starry-eyed Josh stood 
calm and collected at center-stage, 
half-slouching but barely moving 
as he reached deep into his throat 
to release roaring high notes. 
His lax choreography persisted 
throughout “Black Smoke Rising” 
and “Edge Of Darkness,” the 
former (a breakout smash) earning 
such an emphatic response from 
the audience that it became 
difficult to hear him. Josh then 
offered space for his brother, Jake, 
to explode on electric guitar.

Jake’s entire body sways with 

his guitar strums, the instrument 
seeming something like a natural 
extension of his body, so it was 
hardly 
unbelievable 
when 
he 

picked it up and played it behind 
his head. The stunt offered both 
further confirmation of the artist’s 
young-Hendrix status and a razor-

sharp warning of his plans to 
be the band’s central focal point 
during performances. His brother, 
Josh, current frontman, is already 
defending the position, honing his 
emcee skills by employing weak 
humor between songs. However, 
it’s worth betting on Jake to 
become the Julian Casablancas of 
this gang — that boy and his guitar 
are one in the same.

“This song is about peace, love 

and unity,” Josh announced with a 
chuckling grin as the band led into 
their softer tune, “Flower Power.” 
When not singing, his voice is 
dry and almost unrecognizable, 
but as the song takes flight he 
adopts a lazy, bluesy drawl: “She 
is a lady, comes from all around.” 
Mere moments later, with Danny 
Wagner climaxing on the drums, 
Josh instantaneously switches to 
his shocking nasal screech that’s 
by now made the band famous: 
“Heeeeeeey! It turns to night, fire 
light.” It’s a roar in eerie parallel 
with artists who peaked well-
before his own lifetime. “Star 
shines in her eye / Make me feel like 
I’m aliiiiive!” It’s what everybody 
in the sold out crowd come out to 
hear for themselves.

Greta Van Fleet’s setlist also 

included a series of unreleased 
originals that have become staples 
of their recent performances, such 
as the extra crunchy “Mountain 
Of The Sun,” the mellowed-out 
ballad “You’re The One” and the 
eruptively rockin’ “Lover, Leaver 
(Taker, Believer).” Upon their 
completion of the latter, the band 
departed from the stage to prepare 
for an encore, their brief absence 
earning a mass beg for more, the 
audience’s chanting “Greta! Greta!”

The band saved fan favorites 

“Highway Tune” and “Safari Song” 
for last, so when they returned 
onstage, it was truly to reach for 
the night’s maximal energy level. 
Josh hit vocal peaks on the latter 
song’s introductory screams and, 
with their parents in the crowd, his 
twin brothers continued to shine 
by his side. At the drums, Wagner 
played them out in appropriately 
epic fashion.

The show concluded, and all 500 

attendees surely set out to tell their 
friends about the band they’d just 
seen — a band that sounds “exactly 
like Led Zeppelin” and is “totally 
about to blow up.” So goes the story 
of Greta Van Fleet. At least for now.

CONCERT REVIEW

Justine Mahoney’s 
make-believe creatures

1970s “Joburg,” South Africa 

radiated a restlessness that a young 
Justine Mahoney couldn’t quite 
grasp.

“Gangs of kids roamed freely 

in the streets, going up and down 
the road on skates and bikes,” said 
Mahoney to the crowd at Michigan 
Theater Thursday night. “But at 
the same time, there was a feeling 
of unease. Something wasn’t quite 
right. You could feel it.”

She didn’t know what was going 

on in her country. The agitation that 
she felt was from an environment 
that resulted from of the apartheid 
system, the forced segregation 

of Black and white people by the 
South African government.

A similar agitation haunted 

Mahoney when she tried to sleep 
at night. In her bed, she feared 
those monsters that might creep 
in through her windows and 
gremlins that threatened to crawl 
under her sheets and bite off her 
toes as she slept.

“To this day I still have a huge 

fear of something grabbing me 
from underneath my bed, but at the 
same time I also believe that it’s the 
space where your dreams collect,” 
Mahoney said. “It’s a place that I 
feel that I need to go to. It’s really 
scary, but I’m ok with that. I need 
to go there to make the work that 
I do.”

As a child, her nightmares 

contained make-believe horrors. 
As an adult, she is inspired by that 
same big imagination and childlike 
worldview to create her artwork. 
She infuses her imaginings with 
her two inspirations grounded in 
human reality: popular Western 
culture and African culture. Her 
interest in these two elements 
of culture is why the concept of 
afrofuturism is so interesting to her, 
a movement that could categorize 
the nature of her own work. Her 
artistic repertoire is comprised of 
collage and sculpture that take an 
innocent approach to exploring 
nightmarish human experiences. 
Her most recent sculpture series, 
“Tainted,” is a collection of nine 
“creatures” 
— 
make-believe 

characters who have bodies but

ARTIST PROFILE

are not quite human — but who 
represent very human “emotional 
and physical states … by an array of 
growths, swellings, attachments, 
and almost parasitic mutations,” as 
described on Mahoney’s website. 
Mahoney was in Ann Arbor on an 
invitation to speak on her work and 
her “Tainted” series as part of the 
Penny Stamps Speaker series.

Mahoney described cartoons 

as having become a part of her 
consciousness and “Star Wars” as 
having become a part of modern 
society’s mythology. For her, “Star 
Wars” infiltrated her imagination 
so that on her trips to Cape Town 
or the coast, “I would superimpose 
my imaginings of androids and 
robots and creatures onto the 
landscape.”

Mahoney looks to her other 

artistic source, African sculpture, 
“for the way it simplifies the human 
form to its most basic geometric 
elements, but to me it also feels like 
these pieces contain the human 
spirit, not only the human form.” 
She is especially inspired by the 
women of the Ndebele tribe, “who 
immerse themselves in design 
and painting,” Mahoney said. “I’m 
drawn two the boldness of their 
colors and geometric designs and 

where their belief systems are.”

In her own art, Justine Mahoney 

finds that, through collage, she can 
translate the image of South Africa 
— she sees through her own eyes, 
“an extremely schizophrenic place. 
It’s intense, it’s wild, it’s extremely 
exciting.” From Pinterest and old 
images she gathers motifs to create 
her collages through digital means, 
which she then categorizes into 
heads and bodies before making an 
assemblage. Mahoney described 
collaging as a very intuitive process 
she gets lost in, a process on which 
she doesn’t like to put any limits.

In a way, her work speaks to her 

and guides her through her artistic 
process. When creating a collage, 
“They’re basically telling what 
they want,” Mahoney said. “So I’ll 
take, say … a head, and the head will 
say to me ‘okay, I need this.’ And 
I’ll then find a body that kind of 
works with it.” She then uses those 
collages to guide her sculptural 
process. In the same nature as her 
collages, as she works, “the piece 
of clay is also telling me what it 
needs.”

And 
when 
Mahoney 
asks 

questions of her work, it answers. 
In speaking on “Heroine” from 
her “Tainted” series, she describes 

her inquisition with the sculpture. 
Mahoney asked of her, “‘Are you 
me?’ and she says ‘We are all each 
other,’ and I believe her.”

Mahoney’s 
first 
sculpture 

which she created for her series 
“Innocence” does not have eyes, 
and in this way, this sculpture 
based on her inability, as a child, 
to understand the situation in 
her country as she grew up. This 
sculpture is also based on a girl that 
collected money for disabilities 
that Mahoney often encountered 
on trips to the grocery store with 
her mother. At age three, she had 
a bone degenerating disease in 
her left leg that resulted in her 
hospitalization and her wearing a 
cast for a year. And so, Mahoney 
said she “completely identified 
with her. She became my best 
friend … and I based all my work 
on her.”

It is innocence, faith and trust 

in humanity — those childlike 
qualities — that are essential to 
Mahoney’s work. She believes that 
children are those most suited to 
handle the situation of dealing with 
what is alien in life, and it is their 
approach to life that inspires her 
exploration of humanity through 
collage and sculpture.

‘Search Party’ returns

If season one of “Search Party” 

was about evading responsibility, 
season two is about facing it head 
on. The elaborate 
string of clues that 
led the gang to 
Montreal ends up 
being a complete 
waste 
of 
time. 

Chantal is found 
to be unharmed, 
recuperating 
in 
her 
friend’s 

summer home after she and her 
love fell out. That’s the entire gag 
— surprise! Everything is fine! 
Except, really, it’s not. Moments 
before Portia (Meredith Hagner, 
“Younger”) cries out “I’ve found 
Chantal!” Drew (John Reynolds, 
“Stranger Things”) and Dory (Alia 
Shawkat, “Arrested Development”) 
are bludgeoning someone in the 
kitchen of the house. In a great 
twist, the real intrigue of “Search 
Party” starts at the end.

We find our heroes at the 

beginning of season two reeling 

with the sudden course of action 
that has taken place. Dory has 
cured her obsession to find Chantal 
— has been able to maintain 
some personal distance from it. 
Sure, she is ardent in her quest to 
find Chantal’s whereabouts, but 

Dory feels no real 
attachment to the 
girl. Her passion 
project 
has 
led 

her to become an 
accessory 
in 
the 

murder of Keith 
(Ron 
Livingston, 

“Dice”). 
Shawkat 

brings everything in 

post-murder Dory to life, from little 
tics of the eyebrows and lips to an 
uneasy wavering in her voice.

One of the greatest strengths of 

“Search Party” is its ability to keep 
you guessing, yet still satisfying that 
urge for thrill, pause or resolution 
at any given moment. For example, 
viewers were obviously looking for 
an brutal end to the Chantal arc, 
which they get in the form of Keith’s 
murder. Viewers also get to observe 
the shifts in character and the 
coping mechanisms of Dory, Portia, 
Drew and Elliott (John Early, “The 

Disaster Artist”) by forcing them 
to respond to a huge event they’ve 
perpetrated themselves.

“Search Party” is a visual 

spectacle, telling story with scene 
and color as it does with narrative. 
Dory, Drew and Elliott sneak off to 
a recording studio in the basement 
that somewhat resembles “Twin 
Peaks” Black Lodge in its red, 
black and white color scheme and 
isolation. It’s the perfect setting for a 
reckoning with a surreal encounter. 
Elliott wears a jumper with an 
impression that reads “ANYHOW,” 
which adds a layer of visual irony 
since none of the characters can 
afford to act so nonchalant.

The protagonists of “Search 

Party” join the league of other 
characters that are made by 
their mistakes. They are like the 
women of Lena Dunham’s “Girls”: 
self-centered, 
egotistical 
and 

manipulative. Only in this series, 
the stakes are higher and the 
characters are brought together by 
an intense secret.

‘M’ takes down Detroit Mercy

DETROIT — The Michigan 

women’s 
basketball 
team’s 

game against Detroit Mercy 
started off in dramatic fashion 
on Monday night. The Titans 
drilled 
four 
consecutive 

3-pointers to take the lead 
within the first few minutes. 

Detroit 
Mercy’s 
bench 

carried all the energy in the 
gym and got louder with every 
basket 
as 
the 
Wolverines 

slowly fell behind. At the six-
minute mark, the Titans hit 
their fifth 3-pointer of the first 
quarter to take a 10-point lead.

Michigan found its footing 

quickly, though, and finished 
the 
contest 
in 
dominant 

fashion to come away with a 
86-50 win.

“They came out of the gates 

locked in and focused and 
jumped on us right away, but 
we responded once we settled 
in,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 

Kim Barnes-Arico. “But they 
scored 17 points in the first 
four minutes — which was 
incredible — but I thought we 
did a better job defensively, 
and then they missed some 
shots later in the game.”

The Wolverines had eight 

turnovers in the first quarter, 
which senior guard Katelyn 
Flaherty said contributed to 
the Titans’ early run.

“I think our turnovers in the 

beginning really hurt us, and 
it really helped their offense,” 
Flaherty said. “So I think once 
we settled down and really 
locked in defensively, that 
gave us a lot of momentum 
on offense. And we knew that 
they really couldn’t guard us 
in the post with Hallie down 
there, so we got her a lot of 
early looks.”

Slowly 
but 
surely, 
the 

Wolverines closed the gap and 
took the lead by one point with 
40 seconds remaining the first 
quarter.

Michigan finished the first 

quarter in a tie at 20, and then 
came out more aggressive in 
the second quarter. Once the 
Wolverines took 
the 
lead, 
they 

never 
looked 

back, 
finishing 

the 
first 
half 

with 
a 
47-28 

advantage.

The 

Wolverines 
started strongly 
again in the third 
quarter, going on 
an 8-0 stretch 
midway through 
the frame.

While the Titans were able 

to narrow a 35-point deficit 
to 23 at one point in the third 
quarter, they still ended the 
frame down by 30. And when 
Michigan started the fourth 

quarter with four unanswered 
points, it slowly began to 
empty its bench — a sign that 
the game was all but over. 

For 
the 

Wolverines, 
Monday 
was 
another 

memorable 
moment 
at 
Calihan 

Hall, 
where 

Michigan won 
the 
WNIT 

Championship 
game 
last 

season.

“I love this 

place, it’s like our second home 
in 
Michigan,” 
Barnes-Arico 

said. “This university was so 
incredible for allowing us to 
host that WNIT championship. 
This place will always hold a 
special place in my heart.”

Flaherty puts on clinic in win

DETROIT 
— 
Katelynn 

Flaherty opened the second 
half with a pullup 3, the type 
of shot you take when you’re 
feeling 
it. 
When 
Flaherty 

released it from a few feet 
beyond 
the 
line, 
Detroit 

Mercy’s 
Brittney 
Jackson 

yelled 
an 
expletive 
loud 

enough to hear from press 
row. The shot rattled out. 
The sentiment, however, was 
warranted.

On the Wolverines’ next 

possession, the Titans let her 
shoot again, leaving a crease 
for Flaherty to drive through. 
She took it happily, then hit 
the shot to boot.

“I think it’s just funny,” 

Flaherty said, smiling. “I hear 
(expletives) a lot, especially 
when people are trying to 
guard me.”

The 
senior 
point 
guard 

finished the night with 26 
points, 22 of them in the first 

half. Coming into the game, 
her season average was 23.7. 
She was 11-of-14 from the field 
in the first half, dotting her 
shot chart with runners, elbow 
pullups, transition layups, and 
two 3-pointers. In the second, 
she barely needed to play, 
having done her work early.

“When I come out and hit 

my first couple shots, I know 
I’m pretty much gonna have 
a good night,” Flaherty said. 
“I still think that even when I 
miss, but obviously when you 
make it, it just gives you a lot 
of confidence.”

Of course, this wasn’t her 

first rodeo at Calihan Hall. 
Flaherty scored 27 points, 
including two late 3-pointers 
to 
tie 
the 
game, 
against 

Georgia Tech in the WNIT 
Championship game last year.

“We 
had 
shootaround 

today and it was incredible,” 
said coach Kim Barnes Arico. 
“Even pulling up, just the 
memories flooding back as to 
what that meant last year. So it 
was special.”

Unlike other games this year 

where the focus has been more 
on distributing 
the ball from 
the 
point 

guard position, 
Flaherty was a 
pure scorer on 
Monday. She led 
Michigan with 
19 shot attempts 
despite playing 
sparingly — just 
six minutes — in 
the second half. 
Not that anyone 
minded.

“She’s the best scorer in the 

country, we need her to take 19 
shots,” Barnes Arico said. “So 
if she’s not taking shots, I’m 
probably on her to take a few 
more. She needs to shoot the 
basketball every single time 
that she’s open, because she 
doesn’t really miss.”

A month into the season, 

Flaherty’s adjustment to point 
guard hasn’t hindered her 
scoring. Her points per game, 
field-goal 
percentage, 
and 

3-point percentage numbers 

have all gone up this year.

That doesn’t mean things 

have been seamless, however. 
At the start of the year, the 
Wolverines liked going to a 
side pick-and-roll set with 
Flaherty and junior center 
Hallie Thome. They’ve largely 
ditched that now, and have yet 
to find go-to plays that involve 
Flaherty distributing.

“We have a lot of sets, we’ll 

go back to it I’m sure,” Barnes 
Arico said. “Offense seemed 
to be working, I dunno, we 
scored 80-something points, 
so maybe we didn’t need it. I 
always have something in my 
pocket, though, if we need it.”

Michigan 
tried 
some 

HORNS sets early in the 
Detroit game. Those could 
serve that purpose in the 
future — one of them opened 
up a corner 3 for junior guard 
Nicole Munger, though she 
missed.

The team is still trying to 

find the right actions and 
sets for Flaherty as a passer, 
according to Barnes Arico.

“We put in a lot of new stuff,” 

she said. “We didn’t have 

(Flaherty) 
go 

through to the 
side 
pick-and-

roll 
(against 

Detroit) in the 
first half, and 
we were going 
to go to it in the 
second half, but 
we didn’t need 
to.

“Everybody 

watches 
every 
film 
of 

everything 
we 

play, so in games like this, we 
don’t go through our playbook. 
We try to keep it as simple 
as possible. But we put in a 
bunch of different actions to 
try and get Hallie and Kate on 
the same side, because that’s a 
difficult matchup.”

On 
nights 
like 
Monday, 

however, scheme ceases to 
matter. Flaherty could hit from 
any place, at any time, against 
anyone. The only defensive 
solution: don’t let her shoot.

Just ask Brittany Jackson.

Two Michigan commits catch first glimpse of future team

PLYMOUTH, Mich. — True 

to the variance in experience 
levels, Saturday night’s exhibition 
between the Michigan hockey 
team and the U-18 U.S. National 
Team 
Development 
Program 

ended in a lopsided victory for the 
Wolverines.

In front of 3,715 fans — the 

largest home crowd for a USNTDP 
game ever — the college students 
handily put the high schoolers in 
their place with a dominant 7-3 
victory.

Despite 
the 
unfortunate 

outcome for the youngsters, two 
USNTDP players — defensemen 
Bode 
Wilde 
and 
Mattias 

Samuelsson — got their first taste 
of the program they will play for 
next season.

Saturday night, both skaters 

saw 
what 
will 
follow 
the 

completion of their two-year 
stints with the developmental 
program based just 20 minutes 
away from Ann Arbor.

“It 
was 
interesting,” 

Samuelsson said. “Playing them 
in our rink instead of Yost was 
definitely pretty cool. A lot of 
people came out to play, and just 
to see the way they play and what 
they can bring was a pretty good 
experience.”

Added Wilde: “It was pretty 

exciting. I don’t know too many 
of those guys, so I got my first 
impressions of a lot of them on the 
ice, which was great.”

Born 
and 
raised 
in 

Birmingham, 
Mich., 
Wilde 

always had the Wolverines on his 
radar.

As a child, Wilde watched his 

first college hockey game from 
the stands of Yost Ice Arena. 
Years later, he’ll have the chance 
to lace up his skates and play 
on that same ice — donning the 
maize and blue.

“I’ve had a relationship with 

(Michigan assistant coach Brian 
Wiseman) for a while and when 
(coach Mel Pearson) came in, I 
had an opportunity to meet him,” 
Wilde said. “After that, it was a 
no-brainer for me.

“Pearson just explained to me 

the style and way the team played. 
And I think it really suits how I 
play as a player, so it’s a good fit.”

In 23 games this season, Wilde 

ranks third on the USNTDP in 
assists and points with 11 and 
15, respectively. Almost half his 
points — two goals and five assists 
— have come against nine NCAA 
teams, many of which he may face 
again as a Wolverine.

Wilde attributes his success to 

the daily — and intense — regimen 
of the USNTDP over the past year 
and a half, particularly noting the 
importance of facing a plethora of 
Division I and III opponents.

“I think my play has grown 

in all areas,” Wilde said. “I’ve 
become a lot sounder defensively 
and just learning how to create 
offense without the puck rather 
than with it.”

Samuelsson 
has 
also 
put 

up 
impressive 

numbers, 
notching 
four 

goals and seven 
assists 
in 
22 

games, including 
two 
helpers 

Saturday night.

Unlike Wilde, 

the 
Voorhees, 

N.J. native heard 
about 
Michigan 

through 
word-

of-mouth before 
ultimately committing.

“Ann Arbor is a great college 

town and then on top of that, 
it’s a great hockey program,” 
Samuelsson said. “I’ve heard a 

lot about it from guys that I know 
there, and they have nothing 
but good things to say, so it just 
seemed like a great move.”

Samuelsson hails from a hockey 

family. His father, Kjell, played 

in the NHL for 
14 years and is 
currently 
the 

Director of Player 
Development for 
the Philadelphia 
Flyers. 
His 

brother, 
Lukas, 

plays at Western 
Michigan 
University.

The 
six-foot-

four 
blueliner 

came 
into 
the 

USNTDP needing to put on some 
body weight. Through daily gym 
exercises, Samuelsson built his 
frame, and now the 217-pounder 
is a regular in the rotation, 

competing against some of the 
nation’s best young players. 

But even after making strides 

in 
the 
program, 
Samuelsson 

knows there is still room for 
improvement in his play, as 
evidenced by his takeaways from 
facing the Wolverines.

“They win a lot of battles, and 

you could tell that when they have 
opportunities to score, they don’t 
mess up,” Samuelsson said. “You 
can’t take a shift off. These guys 
are older, stronger and they’ll 
take advantage of you if you’re 
slacking.”

Wilde believes winning at the 

college level starts with keeping 
pace with other skaters and 
upping the tempo on the ice.

“Just focusing on playing fast, 

that’s a big one,” Wilde said. 
“College players are big and 
strong, so I need to make sure 
I’m really focusing on what I do 

in the weight room and work on 
my defensive game. That’s going 
to be big next year.”

Wilde and Samuelsson will 

come to Michigan well-traveled, 
with 
impressive 
international 

resumes. As members of the 
USNTDP, the defensemen won 
the 
2016 
U17 
Four 
Nations 

Tournament and 2017 U17 Five 
Nations Tournament.

Wilde also secured the 2016 

World Under-17 Challenge and 
Samuelsson received a gold medal 
in the 2016 Youth Olympic Games.

Many Wolverines have similar 

achievements to their names. 
Ten icemen on its current roster 
— and 47 to date — played for the 
USNTDP. Over the past 18 years, 
many matched up against their 
future team in the annual contest 
before ultimately finding a home 
at Yost the next season.

Coming into the weekend, 

Pearson admitted his gaze may 
wander during the exhibition 
to a handful of players in red, 
white and blue sweaters — like 
Wilde and Samuelsson, though 
he couldn’t comment any further.

“I can’t talk about specific 

guys obviously, but there’s no 
question about it,” Pearson said 
last Tuesday. “Every year we play 
them, you’re always anxious and 
hope your guys play well against 
you. No question about it, you’ll 
have an eye on your team, but 
you’ll be wondering how player A, 
B, C does too.”

After Saturday’s exhibition, 

Pearson had a similar response 
when asked how a certain few 
USNTDP players performed.

“We know who they are, we 

know all the good players. They’ve 
got a roster full of players,” 
Pearson said. “But it’s hard to 
just focus on your team and try to 
judge our team as the game goes, 
so it was a good experience for 
us to watch our guys, but also to 
watch their team a little bit.

“And I noticed some guys.”

2017 Season in Review: Offensive Line

One step forward, one step 

back. 

That 
described 
the 
state 

of Michigan’s offensive line 
this season. The Wolverines’ 
running 
game 
blossomed, 

featuring as the clear focal point 
of the offense. At times, if you 
squinted hard enough, you could 
see shades of Jim Harbaugh’s 
Stanford outfits — more so than 
through his first two years in 
Ann Arbor.

After 
a 
few 
inconsistent 

performances 
early 
in 
the 

season, during which Michigan 
seemed to run an equal amount 
of 
gap-blocking 
and 
zone 

schemes, the Wolverines hit 
their stride midway through the 
year.

It 
wasn’t 
very 
nuanced. 

Michigan 
found 
success 
by 

becoming less diverse, running 
mostly powers and counters. But 
it got the job done.

Pass protection, meanwhile, 

was another story.

Quite 
simply, 
Michigan 

regressed badly. Through 12 
games, the Wolverines gave 
up 34 sacks, ranking No. 112 in 
the nation. Last year, Michigan 
ranked No. 27, allowing just 18 
sacks total.

This year’s struggles haven’t 

just manifested themselves in 
sacks allowed, though. Time 
after 
time, 
the 
Wolverines’ 

quarterback — whether it was 
Wilton Speight, John O’Korn or 
Brandon Peters — had to evade 
heavy pressure.

That dictated what Michigan 

could do on offense, from the 
routes receivers and tight ends 
could run to how many extra 
blockers the Wolverines had to 
use.

Of 
course, 
allowing 
your 

quarterback to take so many hits 
isn’t optimal. That’s something 
Michigan learned twice this 
year, with both Speight and 
Peters suffering injuries after 
big hits.

Much like blocking itself, 

everything 
on 
offense 
is 

interrelated. The carousel under 
center made it difficult to run 

the ball, as tougher opponents 
could key in on it. Despite how 
well the Wolverines ran the ball 
at times, their struggles in pass 
protection show that a blend 
of the two is needed to field a 
successful offense.

HIGH 
POINT: 
The 

Wolverines spent plenty of time 
paving holes in the run game.

Those 
efforts 
began 
at 

Indiana 
on 
Oct. 
14, 
when 

Michigan gashed the Hoosiers 
for 271 rushing yards on 44 
carries with three touchdowns. 
That day, Karan Higdon became 
the first Wolverine since Denard 
Robinson in 2012 to run for 200 
yards — and the first running 
back since Mike Hart in 2007 to 
reach that mark.

Against Rutgers, Michigan 

totaled 
334 
rushing 
yards 

and 
four 
touchdowns. 
The 

Wolverines improved upon that 
only one week later, averaging 
10 yards per carry against 
Minnesota en route to 371 total 
rushing yards.

“It 
was 
a 
stalwart 

performance,” Harbaugh said 
after that game. “... I’ve never 
seen that many plus 50-yard 
runs in one game, any team I’ve 
ever coached or been on.”

LOW POINT: Well, 
this 

could either have been the 
lasting image of Speight lying 
crumpled on the ground, three 
of his vertebrae having been 
cracked, or Peters knocked out 
cold after a jarring hit. 

Against No. 5 Wisconsin, 

Michigan gave up two sacks and 
seven tackles-for-loss. One week 
later, No. 9 Ohio State racked up 
five sacks and seven tackles-for-
loss.

The ground game couldn’t 

get going against any of the 
Wolverines’ tougher opponents, 
either.

Michigan ran the ball 39 

times for 102 yards in a 14-10 
loss to Michigan State, 37 times 
for 58 yards in a 24-10 loss to 
the Badgers and 36 times for 
100 yards in a 31-20 loss to the 
Buckeyes.

THE FUTURE: Michigan’s 

problems with pass protection 
might not be immediately solved. 
Michigan will lose Mason Cole, 
a dependable four-year starter at 
left tackle, without any obvious 
replacements. 
Right 
tackle 

also remains a question mark 
entering next year.

The interior of the line does 

appear to be set, with some 
combination of Ben Bredeson, 
Cesar Ruiz and Mike Onwenu. 
With those three, Michigan 
has a strong foundation to 
build upon in the run game. 
All three fit perfectly in a gap-
blocking scheme, with each 
displaying the requisite agility 
and strength to block powers 
and 
counters 
successfully. 

Mental errors — which plagued 
Bredeson his freshman year and 
Onwenu earlier this year — were 
cut down as the year progressed.

But that trio, too, will need to 

improve its pass blocking if the 
Wolverines are to make strides 
on offense next year. It all starts 
up front, and Michigan was far 
too inconsistent this season.

Michigan suffers 71-62 loss to Ohio State

COLUMBUS — On the road, 

with the crowd roaring during 
Ohio 
State’s 
14-0 
run, 
the 

Michigan men’s basketball team 
needed a bucket. 

It prompted the predicament 

the Wolverines have faced so far 
this season: Who would come up 
with a basket with adversity in 
their face? 

Gone 
are 
Zak 
Irvin 
and 

Derrick Walton Jr. — two former 
Michigan 
players 
capable 
of 

fending off pressure at the 
most opportune times. When it 
mattered most Monday night, 
no Wolverine proved capable of 
stopping the bleeding in time to 
escape with a win.

“I called every number I could 

call,” said Michigan coach John 
Beilein, “and it didn’t happen.”

Spurred by an energetic 26-3 

second-half run, Ohio State (2-0 
Big Ten, 7-3 overall) overcame 
what 
was 
once 
a 
20-point 

Michigan lead to secure a 71-62 
win. 

The loss sets the Wolverines 

(1-1, 6-3) back to .500 in Big Ten 
play, and sends them into two big 
non-conference matchups with a 
sour taste in their mouth. 

Michigan 
followed 
up 

Saturday’s 16-2 start against 
Indiana with another strong start 
against the Buckeyes, taking a 14-6 
lead early. With similar offensive 
precision, the Wolverines assisted 
on four of their first five field goals 
and 11 total in the first half. 

Eight 
different 
Michigan 

players scored in the first half 
and six hit at least one 3-pointer, 
en route to a frame in which 
the 
Wolverines 
made 
seven 

threes, turned the ball over just 
twice and scored 1.42 points per 
possession.

They appeared to be on their 

way to a comfortable victory — 
their second convincing win in 
the early stretch of Big Ten play.

But Jae’Sean Tate, Keita Bates-

Diop and the Buckeyes had other 
ideas. 

Initiated by a rare, five-point 

possession late in the first half, 
the 
Buckeyes 
carried 
their 

momentum out of the halftime 
break, scoring 19 of the first 22 

points in the half and stymying 
Michigan’s once-potent offense. 

“As good as we were in the first 

18 minutes of the first half, we 
were equally as bad in the second 
half,” Beilein said. “We couldn’t 
make a basket or couldn’t make, 
really, a right play in that time. … 
When things got a little tough, we 
really had trouble stepping up.”

The Wolverines never regained 

their composure, playing a half 
eerily reminiscent of the second 
half against North Carolina.

Midway through the second 

half, Tate attacked the rim with 
vigor, 
lowering 
his 
shoulder 

into the chest of junior forward 
Duncan Robinson, and finished 
through contact to narrow the 
deficit to only one point. Robinson, 
regularly the target of the duo’s 
attack, struggled to handle their 
physicality in the post. 

“We try to be positive (when 

facing opposing runs), kinda 
get back to what got us there,” 
said fifth-year senior Duncan 
Robinson. “That noise happened, 
we have to band together, do 
a better job of that. We kind 
of frayed when we hit some 

adversity.”

Tate and Diop combined for 

21 of their team’s 45 shots and 
32 of their 71 points, challenging 
Michigan’s forwards all night and 
dictating the physical nature of 
the second half.

There were some positives 

from the Wolverines, particularly 
from unexpected sources in the 
first half.

Two days after watching the 

entire Indiana game from the 
bench, fifth-year senior guard 
Jaaron 
Simmons 
looked 
the 

most comfortable he’s been in 
a Michigan uniform, notching 
three assists in his seven first-half 
minutes.

Two days after watching his 

younger counterpart — freshman 
Jordan Poole — steal the show, 
sophomore Ibi Watson earned 
the first minutes off the bench at 
the shooting guard position and 
immediately rewarded his coach 
with a 3-pointer and defensive 
energy. 

And two days after not scoring, 

sophomore 
Zavier 
Simpson 

showed poise in the pick-and-
roll, scoring seven of the team’s 
first 19 points despite coming off 
the bench once again. Simpson 
brought a modicum of composure 
to the Wolverines as they began 
to crumble in the second half. His 
ability to attack the rim off the 
pick-and-roll proved to be one of 
the team’s only sources of scoring 
down the stretch.

Despite those efforts, the game 

was decided in the second half. 
Michigan shot 18 percent from 
the field, scored just 19 points and 
made only one of its last 10 field 
goal attempts — the lone make 
being an uncontested dunk with 
the game essentially over.

With no ability to counter Ohio 

State’s punches, the Wolverines 
will have to head back to Ann 
Arbor with its most frustrating 
loss of the season.

“They came at us,” Beilein said, 

“and we did not respond.”

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Inconsistency shows 

again for ‘M’

C

OLUMBUS — If you’ve 
tried predicting much 
about the Michigan men’s 

basketball team, you probably 
haven’t been too successful. 

You’re not to blame, though. 

Coach John Beilein’s squad 
has been a mashup of different 
lineups and star performers on 
a nightly basis. The revolving 
door that has rested on Beilein’s 
psyche has revealed both the 
question marks and the potential 
for the Wolverines this season. 
It’s perhaps the lingering 
uncertainty that keeps him up at 
night.

The closest semblance of a 

hero in Monday night’s 71-62 loss 
to Ohio State was sophomore 
point guard Zavier Simpson. 
Did you guess that? Me neither, 
but no hero should have been 
required — win or loss.

Michigan was up by 20 points 

at one point, and the Buckeyes 
had no answers to combat the 
offensive onslaught. But just 
19 second-half points by the 
Wolverines — their worst half 
output of the season thus far 
— provided Ohio State with 
more chances than it could have 
imagined, and Michigan paid the 
price.

“Anytime you lose in the Big 

Ten, but especially when you 
lose to your rival the way we did, 
it’s just frustrating,” said senior 
guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman. “We just gotta go back 
to the drawing board.”

In their two-point loss to 

LSU in the Maui Invitational, 
the Wolverines faltered 
late, which overshadowed 
scintillating scoring outputs 
from junior Moritz Wagner and 
redshirt sophomore Charles 
Matthews. In the smackdown 
by North Carolina — a game 
that Michigan was expected to 
lose — underclassmen showed 
promising signs of composure on 
the road.

Against the Buckeyes on 

Monday night, Michigan was 
cruising and no star was needed.

Ohio State finished the half on 

a 7-0 run, closing the Wolverines’ 
lead to 13, injecting signs of life 
into an otherwise lulled crowd.

“I actually told them I’m glad 

we aren’t up by 20 at half,” Beilein 
said. “Because if they make a run, 

they just made a run. Now, let’s go 
out there with some purpose.”

That purpose was realized 

far too late. Right out of the 
gate, the Buckeyes went into 
overdrive. Ohio State hit seven 
quick field goals, while Michigan 
could hardly decipher how to 
put the ball in the basket. And 
after a 26-3 run — with a lone 
3-pointer from Eli Brooks for the 
Wolverines — the Buckeyes were 
staring at their first lead all game 
with 12:29 to go.

“We couldn’t score and we 

couldn’t stop them,” Beilein said 
dejectedly. “This is something, 
it’s gonna be a journey all year for 
us until we grow our young kids, 
right? And our veterans embrace 
their new roles as being the guys, 
right? Being the guy that’s gotta 
make a shot, that’s gotta make a 
play at a certain time.

“Our freshmen and 

sophomores made some baskets, 
but there weren’t many in the 
second half, were there?”

Sure, Michigan quickly 

battled back to make it a tit-for-
tat contest, but Ohio State knew 
it was the better team on the 
court then, and it wasn’t going 
to blow its comeback efforts. 
Jae’Sean Tate and Keita Bates-
Diop were unflappable versus 
the Wolverines’ frontcourt, a 
response that wasn’t met in kind.

When CJ Jackson’s free 

throws gave the Buckeyes their 
final, unadulterated lead with 
2:59 to go, it was a game of 
“hot potato” to resurrect the 
Wolverines, but no winners 
emerged.

“We like to play as a team, 

nobody wants to be considered a 
hero or playing hero ball,” Abdur-
Rahkman said. “We just try to 
play within the offense, and we 
didn’t get good shots and passed 
up some good shots, too.”

Beilein has emphasized that 

it’s still early and that his team 
stumbled against the Buckeyes 
last year and rebounded. The 
players say they will have to have 
short-term memory about this 
game, but Michigan is already 
almost at the halfway point of its 
season.

That begs the question: When 

do results like this happen just 
too late?
