faculty Sherry Lee Linkon, 
English 
and 
American 

Studies professor, and John 
Russo, 
visiting 
scholar 
at 

the Kalmanovitz Initiative 
for Labor and Working Poor. 
Linkon and Russo focused on 
patterns of voting among the 
working class with an eye on 
the 2018 midterm elections.

The 
lecture, 
“Don’t 

Blame 
the 
Working-Class: 

Understanding 
Working-

Class Politics and Culture 
in 
the 
Trump 
Era,” 

stemmed 
from 
the 
book 

Linkon and Russo recently 
co-authored, “Social Costs of 
Deindustrialization,” 
about 

the 
city 
of 
Youngstown, 

Ohio. Youngstown suffered 
immensely from the downfall 
of the steel industry that had 
been central to their economy.

Linkon began the lecture 

by 
affirming 
those 
who 

voted 
for 
Donald 
Trump 

largely came from higher-
class 
demographics, 
in 

contrast to popular belief. 
While the white working-
class 
did 
contribute 
to 

Trump’s election, she found 
that 
Hillary 
Clinton 
won 

by 
a 
significant 
margin 

among voters of low-income 
brackets. 
Trump’s 
largest 

margin of victory was from 
people who made $200,000 
or more. Linkon emphasized 

other factors, such as race and 
education level, as indicators 
to votes.

“The one factor you could 

most clearly predict for who 
voted for Trump versus who 
voted for Clinton was race,” 
she said.

Linkon 
also 
explored 

common 
misconceptions 

about why the white working 
class 
voted 
for 
Trump, 

such as lack of education, 

discontent with being left 
behind by global economy and 
racism. According to Linkon, 
disenfranchisement and lack 
of trust in politics played a 
larger part. She referenced 
a New York Times poll that 
asked working class voters 
which elected officials they 
felt were fighting for them. 
The most common response 
was 
not 
Democrats 
or 

Republicans, but rather, “no 

one.”

“As 
we 
see 
it, 
Trump 

really did appeal to many 
disaffected voters, but we 
have 
to 
understand 
that 

they’re 
disaffected 
for 
a 

variety of reasons, including 
people having seen politician 
after politician come to places 
like Youngstown and make 
promises, and then went to 
Washington and did nothing 

At least three University 

of Michigan students were 
recently 
diagnosed 
with 

mumps, according to a campus-
wide email sent Tuesday from 
Robert Ernst, the executive 
director 
of 
the 
University 

Health 
Service, 
which 

provides health care services 
to University students, faculty 
and staff.

“I want to assure you that we 

are coordinating with campus 
partners, Michigan Medicine, 
and state and county public 
health authorities to identify, 
treat and prevent mumps,” 
Ernst wrote in the email.

According 
to 
a 

Washtenaw 
County 
Health 

Department fact sheet, the 
virus, which Ernst said is 
“fairly easily transmitted,” is 
spread through droplets in the 
air, such as from coughing or 
sneezing. Symptoms of mumps 
can appear 12 to 25 days after 
the 
initial 
exposure 
and 

include headaches, fever, and

Journalists renew attention for crisis at border

AARON BAKER/Daily

Ginger Thompson discusses the border crisis at the Ford Building Tuesday.

CAMPUS LIFE

Panelists discuss causes, changes and next steps in immigration debate in event hosted by Wallace House and Ford School

“The news is moving so fast. 

We move week after week, from 
story to story, from crisis to 
crisis, from despair to outrage, 
to not knowing where to turn. 
Sometimes it’s important to stop 
and step back, and remember 
that even if the story at the front 
of the news has moved forward, 
the thing that we were talking 
about one month ago. . . is still 
very active and still requires our 
attention,” Lynette Clemetson, 
director of the Wallace House 
at the University of Michigan, 
opened.

On Tuesday evening, Wallace 

House, an organization focused 
on encouraging civic engagement 
through journalism and the 
free press, hosted a panel of 
journalists at the Ford School of 
Public Policy to discuss the crisis 
at the United States-Mexican 
border. Though it may not be at 
the forefront of recent headlines, 
the problem is still affecting 
thousands of immigrants daily.

This panel coincided with the 

University’s Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion Summit, a week-

long event to reflect on and 
evaluate the initiatives Michigan 
has taken to improve its racial 
composition and climate. 

Social Work student Joanna 

Jaimes said she came to the event 
interested in the intersection of 
social work and politics, having 
grown up listening to journalist 
Maria Elena Salinas, who spoke 
at the event.

“Latino students on campus 

and 
our 
representation 
is 

important at events like this,” 
Jaimes said.

Salinas is the host of her own 

news-magazine show, “The Real 
Story with Maria Elena Salinas,” 
and 
has 
received 
numerous 

awards recognizing her work in 
investigative journalism and the 
awareness she has brought to the 
implications of the United States’ 
immigration policies.

Public 
Policy 
graduate 

student 
Jose 
Javier 
Lujano 

introduced Salinas, praising the 
fundamental trust she has been 
able to build with the people she 
is interviewing.

“(Salinas) knew her audience’s 

stories as if they were her own,” 
Lujano said.

Salinas moderated a panel 

composed of Ann Lin, associate 

professor in the Ford School of 
Public Policy, Aaron Nelsen, 
2019 
Knight-Wallace 
Fellow, 

and Ginger Thompson, a senior 
reporter at ProPublica. The 
panelists discussed the trajectory 
of current American policies 
and the political discourse over 
what immigration laws actually 
state versus how they are being 
enforced.

Lin claimed the current 

immigration crisis is a result 
of the disconnect between 
the actual policies 
and 
a 

consideration 
of 
their 

implications. The 1997 Florez v. 
Reno settlement set restrictions 
on how long children can be 
separated from their families 
while 
their 
parents 
are 

undergoing court proceedings, 

whether that be in the process 
of applying for asylum, or in the 
process of being prosecuted for 
re-entering the United States 
after originally being deported.

Thompson 
explained 

the 
Obama 
administration 

was previously sued by the 
American Civil Liberties Union 
for 
detaining 
families 
for 

too long, violating the Florez 
settlement. This violation is the 
reasoning behind the Trump 
administration 
separating 

children from their families; so 
that the families as a whole are 

not detained unlawfully.

The 
Trump 

administration is also 
separating 
children 

from their families in

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | OCTOBER 10, 2018


The Senate yesterday postponed 

its vote on Clarence Thomas’ 
Supreme 
Court 
nomination 

for one week to investigate 
allegations he sexually harassed 
a former aide. Thomas “totally 
and unequivocally” denied the 
accusation.

The 
embattled 
nominee 

requested 
a 
delay 
to 
“clear 

my name” as several crucial 
Democratic supporters said they 
could not vote for him until the 
allegations were aired.

Senate Majority Leader George 

Mitchell 
of 
Maine 
said 
the 

allegations should be “publicly 
and fairly resolved.”

Anita Hill, a law professor who 

says Thomas made repeated lewd 
remarks to her when she worked 

for him a decade ago, said she 
would cooperate with the Senate. 
“I intend to go to Washington if it 
is requested,” she said.

Thomas appeared to be a sure 

bet for confirmation until Hill’s 
allegations became public over 
the weekend. Since then, several 
Thomas opponents have urged 
new 
committee 
hearings 
to 

investigate Hill’s allegations.

Thomas supporters had initially 

fought a delay, but relented when 
it became clear there might not be 
enough support for confirmation if 
the Senate voted yesterday. “I can 
count,” said Senate Republican 
leader Bob Dole of Kansas.

The decision to delay the vote 

capped a dramatic and remarkable 
day 
which 
saw 
the 
Senate 

agonizing not only over how to 
proceed with the nomination but 
also with the larger issue of its 
sensitivity to the issue of sexual 
harassment.

Even as they reluctantly agreed 

to the delay, Republicans vented 
anger that a private committee 
report on Hill’s allegations was 
leaked to the media. Sen. Hank 
Brown 
(R-Colo.), 
a 
Judiciary 

Committee 
member, 
said 
he 

would demand appointment of a 
special prosecutor to investigate 
unspecified violations of Senate 
rules. 

Under the agreement reached 

yesterday night, the vote on the 
Thomas nomination was delayed 
exactly one week, until 6 p.m. EDT 
Oct 15. 

Mitchell said the delay was 

“to give time for further inquiry 
into this matter by the Judiciary 
Committee.” He did not say what 
action the committee would take. 

Seven of 13 Democrats who 

had announced their support for 
Thomas — Alan Dixon of Illinois, 
Richard Bryan and Harry Reid 
of Nevada, Joseph Lieberman 
of Connecticut, J. James Exon 
of Nebraska, Wyche Fowler of 
Georgia, and Richard Shelby of 
Alabama — all called for a delay in 
the vote. 

If supporters forced a vote, “this 

senator would be in a position 
to vote against the nomination,” 
Bryan said. Exon said he would 
either abstain or vote against 
Thomas if the vote were held 

yesterday.

Danforth proposed that the 

Senate Judiciary Committee take 
testimony from Thomas and Hill.

Mitchell met privately with 

Dole and others as a growing 
number 
of 
senators 
urged 

postponement.

Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.) 

chairperson 
of 
the 
Judiciary 

Committee, reversing his earlier 
position, joined the call.

President Bush, asked in late 

afternoon if he was standing by 
the nomination, said, “You’re darn 
right.”

Thomas remained out of public 

view. Danforth released a sworn 
affidavit in which the nominee 
said, “I totally and unequivocally 
deny Anita Hill’s allegations of 

misconduct of any kind toward 
her, sexual or otherwise.”

“At 
all 
times 
during 
the 

period she worked with me, 
our 
relationship 
was 
strictly 

professional,” 
Thomas 

said. “During that time and 
subsequently, the relationship has 
been wholly cordial.”

“These allegations are untrue,” 

Thomas said in the affidavit he 
had signed earlier in the day. “I 
am terribly saddened and deeply 
offended by these allegations.”

Hill, 
flanked 
by 
three 

bodyguards and surrounded by 
reporters 
and 
photographers, 

made her way into the University 
of 
Oklahoma 
Law 
School 

yesterday afternoon, declining to 
answer questions.

MONDAY:

Looking at the Numbers

Last 
week, 
Democratic 

gubernatorial 
candidate 

Gretchen Whitmer released 
her 
health 
care 
proposal 

which included a provision to 
raise the statewide legal age 
for purchasing tobacco from 
18 to 21, an issue that has seen 
bipartisan support on the 
University of Michigan.

Currently, Ann Arbor is just 

one of two localities where 
the legal tobacco purchasing 
age is already 21, along with 
Genesee County. While this 
policy may be uncommon 
within Michigan, it is rapidly 

gaining popularity across the 
greater United States, and 
has already been enacted 
in several states, including 
California, New Jersey and 
Oregon.

Whitmer 
explained 
her 

rationale for supporting the 
bill, citing the importance of 
public health. She said she 
believes it is an issue both 
parties can get behind.

“The facts show that this 

is an issue that everyone, 
regardless of party, should 
get serious about,” Whitmer 
told The Daily. “The leading 
cause of death in adults 
under 70 is tobacco, and 95 
percent 
of 
adult 
smokers 

started smoking before they 
turned 21. If we want to keep 
Michiganders 
healthy 
and 

lower tobacco-related deaths 
in Michigan, we’ve got to 
raise the tobacco-purchasing 
age.”

The 
University 
of 

Michigan’s 
chapter 

of 
College 
Democrats 

supported Whitmer’s stance, 
according to Public Policy 
junior 
Cathrine 
Kelly, 

communications director for 
the organization. Kelly echoed 
Whitmer’s health concerns 
and agreed Michigan needed 
t lower smoking rates.

“This 
policy 
is 
already 

local law in Ann Arbor and 

it helps deter young people 
from starting up this deadly 
habit,” Kelly said. “We have 
high rates of tobacco use in 
Michigan and raising the 
legal age will help to reduce 
that.”

Democrats 
are 
not 
the 

only ones in favor of this 
policy. LSA sophomore Dylan 
Berger, 
president 
of 
the 

University’s 
chapter 
of 

College 
Republicans, 
said 

it 
would 
help 
Michigan’s 

public health and that he fully 
agreed with Whitmer on this 
issue.

“I would hope that my 

fellow 
Republicans

The 
Central 
Student 

Government 
convened 
for 

their sixth meeting of the 
year 
Tuesday 
to 
discuss 

the confirmation of various 
member positions, as well as 
highlight goals surrounding 
Election Day on Nov. 6.

The meeting began with 

Speaker 
of 
the 
Assembly 

Austin Glass in conjunction 
with CSG President Daniel 

Greene introducing potential 
new members to the assembly.

Twelve 
members 
were 

put in front of the assembly 
for a presentation of their 
credentials 
as 
well 
as 
a 

question-and-answer 
style 
discussion 
before 

each member voted on the 
confirmation 
of 
the 
new 

member. All 12 members were 
confirmed to the government.

Among 
other 
topics 

of 
discussion 
included 
a 

motion 
proposed 
by 
Ben 

Gerstein, LSA representative 

and 
sophomore, 
for 
CSG 

to purchase and distribute 
stamps for students to use 
for voting related purposes, 
such 
as 
mailing 
absentee 

ballots. Following discussion 
and revisions, the motion 
was approved unanimously 
by the assembly. According to 
Gerstein, the stamps would be 
distributed to give increased 
voting access to students.

“What we would like to 

do is purchase stamps and 
envelopes and distribute them 
to students so they have the 

resources they need to have 
no excuse, and to avoid not 
sending in a by-mail ballot,” 
Gerstein said.

The meeting ended with a 

series of resolutions including 
acquiring room reservations 
on campus to allow students 
easier access to poll training 
for Election Day, as well as 
a resolution to allow for full 
financial 
transparency 
of 

CSG spending to students. 
These were moved to be 
discussed at a later date.

Michigan State Government 
are open to Whitmer’s idea. I 
think both Republicans and 
Democrats can agree that 
tobacco usage has an adverse 
impact on Michigan’s well 
being and work to limit its 
usage,” Berger said. “As Ms. 
Whitmer has said, 95 percent of 
adult smokers started smoking 
before the age of 21. I believe 
raising the age required to 
buy tobacco would help curb 
Michigan’s tobacco usage. The 
human and economic costs of 
tobacco usage in Michigan are 
overwhelming.”

Berger also added he felt the 

proposal would help Michigan 

economically, 
something 

Whitmer also mentioned in 
her health care proposal.

“Over 
200,000 
children 

currently under the age of 18 
will eventually succumb to 
tobacco-related 
illnesses,” 

Berger said. “On the economic 
side, Michigan spends over 
$4.5 billion on health care costs 
due to smoking. Moreover, 
smoking costs Michigan over 
$4.75 billion in productivity 
loss as a result of tobacco-
related illnesses. Working to 
minimize tobacco usage in 
Michigan will be a boon for 
our health and economy.”

Shortly after Ann Arbor’s 

smoking 
ordinance 
went 

into effect in 2017, Attorney 
General Bill Schuette, who 
is now also the Republican 
candidate for governor, issued 

an opinion saying claiming the 
ordinance was in conflict with 
state law, though it was never 
challenged in court.

Additionally, 
Whitmer, 

Kelly and Berger all said they 
were in favor of extending 
smoking codes and regulations 
to products such as vapes and 
e-cigarettes. 

“Per CDC data, the number 

of high school students that 
used e-cigarettes in the past 
30 days increased by about 75 
percent over the past year,” 
Berger said. “ I believe that 
e-cigarettes 
are 
harmful 

on their own and have the 
potential 
to 
raise 
a 
new 

generation of nicotine addicts. 
I would like to see Michigan 
State Government take action 
to combat e-cigarette usage by 

happening at the Palestinian-
Israeli 
border. 
Families 
are 

subject to family separations, 
discrimination, 
harassment. 

They’re usually detained for 
hours and hours, even if you are 
an American citizen.”

The 
member 

explained 
how 
students 
of 

Palestinian or Arab heritage 
who go on study abroad trips 
through the University are often 
stopped at checkpoints, where 
they are forced to wait in long 
lines and are subject to intense 
interrogation, strip-searches and 
other forms of harassment.

The 
member 
also 
spoke 
 

about 
international 
political 

blacklists, highlighting the fears 
many Palestinian, Arab and 
Pro-Palestinian students have of 
being placed on a blacklist.

Central 
Student 

Government passed a #UMDivest 
resolution for the first time in 
the University’s history in 2017, 
which was also the first time the 

body allowed for a secret ballot, 
which members approved to 
protect pro-Palestinian students 
from blacklists.

“If you are put on that list 

and 
you 
go 
through 
these 

checkpoints, they’ll pull you 
out and you’re going to be 
interrogated, you’ll probably be 
deported, not allowed in,” the 
student said. “That’s something 

that the University has ignored 
time after time and has not 
released any statements about, 
and that’s another thing we’re 
trying to raise awareness about.”

LSA senior Yezenia Sandova, 

a member of La Casa, an 
organization 
that 
supported 

SAFE in its divestment resolution 
last year, said it was important 
to 
show 
solidarity 
with 

communities 
facing 
similar 

struggles.

Sandoval spoke about the 

parallels 
between 
the 
two 
 

border 
walls, 
especially 

considering the human rights 
violations committed as a result 
of the walls. She also highlighted 
the demonstration’s aim to raise 
awareness of struggles faced by 

minority students on campus and 
how the walls are affecting their 
lives at the University.

“Our main purpose, hopefully, 

by having this painting out here, 
was just to raise awareness and 
continue to have the U.S.-Mexico 
border conflict in the minds of 
people, especially when it comes 
to family separation, especially 
when it comes to Trump’s zero-
tolerance policy, his termination 
of catch and release and just 
to show how inhumane these 
policies are and how even 
 

after so many months, there’s 
literally 
no 
comprehensive 

immigration reform,” Sandoval 
said. “There (are) people in 
Central America and all of 
these countries struggling and 
trying to come to the U.S. for 
more 
educational, 
economic 

opportunities, 
and 
who 
are 

facing violence, persecution in 
their communities, and that’s 
a lot of the parallels that’s 
happening in Israel, Palestinians 
are facing a lot of human rights 
violations and inhuman policies, 
especially in interactions when it 
comes to border patrol.”

The SAFE member agreed, 

highlighting 
their 
efforts 

through 
divestment 
and 

demonstrations like Tuesday’s, to 
hold the University accountable 
for its actions in human rights 
violations. The 2017 divest vote, 
which was later voted down 
by the Board of Regents, called 
for the University to divest 
from Boeing, Hewlett Packard 
and 
United 
Technologies 

for 
supplying 
weapons 
and 

equipment to the Israeli military. 
As recently as June, Israel 
has been condemned by the 
United Nations for using lethal 
forceagainst Palestinian civilians 
protesting at the Gaza border.

“It’s important for us to get 

these walls out because we 
want to make sure that people 
are understanding the stake 
and how complicit we are as a 
University in these crimes. I 
know the border wall seems so 
far away… but our University is 
very complicit in these human 
rights violations because we are 
investing in American companies 
that are profiting off these border 
walls,” the student said. “We’re 
still pushing for the University to 
form a committee to investigate 
our 
investments 
in 
these 

companies that are complicit in 
the human rights violations at 
each of these borders.”

to help any of those workers,” 
she said.

Linkon also emphasized the 

importance of cultural effects 
from the economic devastation 
of 
deindustrialization, 
and 

how a feeling of hopelessness 
has 
extended 
to 
multiple 

generations. She referenced 
the common perception of 
Detroit as a fallen power to 
illustrate the point.

“You may not see the losses, 

but they’re there. And it’s 
continuing to create disease 
and difficulty and destroy 
the lives of communities,” 
she said. “If you live in a 
deindustrialized community, 
you hear again and again to 
get over it, and there are many 
reasons why they can’t get 
over it.”

Russo shifted the focus 

away from solely the industry 
workers 
and 
taking 
into 

account the widespread effects 
of economic recessions.

“It’s not just about the 

workers, 
It’s 
about 
what 

happened in 2008, the Great 
Recession. It’s the people who 
lost their health care, lost 
their pensions,” he said. “No 
doubt steel workers are part 
of the argument, but this is 
happening continuously.”

He 
also 
claimed 

Democrats 
have 
failed 
to 

mobilize the working class 
because separation between 
Washington, D.C., and the 
Midwest has isolated unique 
problems faced in previously 
industry-driven cities.

“In our studies, we found 

that a lot of people from 
the East Coast never really 
fully 
understood 
that 
was 

happening 
to 
the 
country. 

Washington is a bubble,” he 
said. “I live there nine months 
of the year, but the issues that 
are happening in the Midwest 
are 
not 
fully 
addressed 

politically. Youngstown’s story 
is America’s story.”

He also emphasized the 

issue of grouping the working 
class together. He compared 
Trump’s rhetoric to former 
presidential candidate Bernie 
Sanders, 
explaining 
how 

Sanders’s platform mobilized 
this group’s anger but directly 
targeted 
corporations 
and 

Wall 
Street, 
creating 
an 

institutional barrier.

“Firstly, 
there’s 
no 
one 

working class: The Black is 
different from the white, which 
differs by state,” he said. “Why 
Trump won is he redirected 
all 
that 
worker 
anger 
of 

their economic security, and 
 

moved 
it 
into 
a 
fight 

against 
African 
Americans, 

immigrants, 
rather 
than 

against corporations or Wall 
Street.”

LSA junior Jeremiah Dunne 

said the event gave him new 
perspective into the history of 
the working class.

“It’s a really interesting 

issue in this country, now 
especially. In my class we 
talk about the perspective of 
the working class people a 
lot, and how they’ve become 
disenfranchised through this 
careful effort of the wealthy. 
You can look back when unions 
first started in the thirties, 
and the working class was very 
involved in politics, and they 
were willing to work together 
and fight for their worth,” 

he said. “But nowadays the 
average auto worker doesn’t 
feel like they’re worth much. 
In fact, their employer tells 
them how much they’re worth 
depending on their paycheck. 
So 
a 
lot 
of 
people 
work 

minimum wage and they don’t 
feel like they’re worth health 
insurance, so they don’t fight 
for it.”

He provided the example 

of nationalized health care 
as a way that workers are 
mistreated.

“That’s also one of the 

reasons why corporations are 
against 
nationalized 
health 

care, because it makes the 
average person feel like they’re 
worth more, and they deserve 
things from the government 
and 
corporations,” 
Dunne 

said. 
“Despite 
nationalized 

healthcare being cheaper for 
corporations, 
because 
they 

don’t have to pay for people’s 
health care, they won’t in the 
long-run because it gives the 
worker power. That’s just an 
example of how bad things are 
for workers.”

Ernst 
noted 
severe 

complications 
with 
the 

virus can sometimes occur, 
which 
include 
encephalitis, 

meningitis and deafness.

Mumps can be prevented 

by vaccination, though Ernst 
said mumps can cause some 
non-serious 
symptoms 
even 

in 
people 
who 
have 
been 

immunized. It is also possible 
for people carrying the virus 
to not display any symptoms. 
Ernst said a person with mumps 
could remain contagious until 
five days after symptoms begin.

According to the Centers 

for 
Disease 
Control, 
the 

implementation of the U.S. 
mumps vaccination program in 
1967 decreased recorded cases 
of mumps by 99 percent to less 
than 1,000 cases per year. In 
both 2016 and 2017, however, 
the number of mumps cases 
recorded nationally was above 
6,000, “mainly due to multiple 
mumps 
outbreaks 
reported 

across the country in settings 
where people often have close 
contact with one another, like 
college campuses.”

Guests pour through books from the 19th century to the present at the Special Collections After hours: Skeletons in Our Closet event Tuesday.

SPIRIT BOOK S

attempt to deter immigrants from 
coming to the United States or 
spending years in the United States 
while applying for asylum. Nelsen 
said these immigration policies 
are harsh and often inhumane by 
nature, but emphasized that the 
current hardline policies have 
done very little to stop the flow 
of immigrants from Honduras, 
El 
Salvador 
and 
Guatemala, 

that we saw during the Obama 
administration.

Nelsen 
also 
discussed 
the 

shift in how U.S. Customs and 
Border 
Patrol 
officials 
have 

interacted with the media, and 
the implications this has on the 
current political conversation. 

He claimed under the Obama 
administration, 
Border 
Patrol 

was very straightforward and 
clear about their intentions. Now, 
he claims, they are intentionally 
vague to hide the fact that they are 
denying interviews to immigrants 
trying to enter legally.

Thompson explained she was 

able to investigate what was 
really happening inside these 
camps, through a confidential 
source that risked their job to 
garner 
attention. 
Thompson 

obtained a tape of a young girl 
crying to call her aunt inside of 
a detention center, which caught 
the attention of the nation and the 
White House.

“Those children and their 

voices 
drowned 
out 
all 
the 

political noise and the only thing 
anybody could hear anymore 

were those cries. Even people 
who thought they might support 
the idea of cracking down at the 
border, and more security at the 
border, didn’t think it should look 
like that,” Thompson said.

The 
panelists 
explained 

their personal experiences with 
the success of giving a face to 
the statistics, and of simply 
portraying humans as humans. 

Lin explained those coming to 

the U.S. seeking asylum know that 
once they get here, things won’t 
necessarily be easy; they will 
just be easier than the turmoil of 
their home country. People are 
immigrating to escape cultures 
of crime and violence to gain the 
ability to work and provide for 
their families. None of these fears 
satisfy the requirements to be 
granted asylum.

The Obama administration was 

relatively lenient on deporting 
people that had legitimate reasons 
to come to the U.S., even if those 
reasons may not have qualified 
them legally. Immigration and 
Customs 
Enforcement 
has 

historically delayed deportation 
for immigrants that have led 
successful lives in the U.S. for 
decades, 
but 
recently, 
these 

same people have been deported 
immediately upon their arrival to 
their court dates.

Thompson argued the high 

deportation rates in the U.S. 
violate the international laws 
the 
U.S. 
government 
signed, 

and the U.S. should be accepting 
more people, even if we are 
not comfortable doing so. Lin 
explained that in 1980, the U.S. 
accepted more than 200,000 

immigrants, taking responsibility 
for the wars and civil unrest the 
U.S. contributed to in Southeast 
Asia. The Trump administration 
recently stated that they are 
implementing a ceiling for 30,000 
immigrants this year.

Nelson argued U.S. policies are 

a major contributor to the influx 
of immigrants trying to come 
to the U.S. He explained that 
Americans are exporting gang 
culture to Central America and 
enjoying recreational drug use 
from the illegal drugs imported 
from Mexico. These drug cartels 
are terrorizing citizens, with the 
money we are handing to them, he 
argued.

In terms of solutions, Lin 

proposed the U.S. needs to 
reinstate previous policies to 
the forefront of our actions. She 

explained that many people are 
trying to enter the states legally, 
citing that 90 percent of people 
asked to come to asylum hearings 
show up, and suggested that the 
government simply give them a 
chance to enter legally.

Clemetson 
concluded 
the 

conversation 
reiterating 
the 

goal of this panel, which wasn’t 
to identify one clear solution, 
but rather to simply start the 
conversation.

“In a conversation like this the 

goal cannot be to provide answers 
. . . the goal we decided on is to 
provide context, to provide true, 
on the ground experience, to 
provide different points of view, 
and to provide connections with 
the audience,” Clemetson said.

“

Reed, I am having an 
emergency. We need to go 
upstairs to your room right 
now.”
 “Ok, let’s go,” I said to my 
friend Michael as I gestured 
toward the stairs. Upon escaping 
from the party and arriving in 
my room, I asked Michael the 
obvious question: “What’s going 
on?” His answer was far more 
complicated than I could have 
predicted.
Michael, 
who 
isn’t 
old 
enough to buy alcohol, has been 
in 
a 
dedicated 
relationship 
for the better half of the last 
decade. “Okay dude, please just 
let me tell you what happened 
before you start judging me. You 
promise?”
“Yeah, I promise.”
“Ok, so a few weeks ago 
I downloaded Tinder on my 
phone.” I quickly shot Michael 
an inquisitive look. “Yeah, I 
know, but look — all I have 
been doing is swiping right 
on everyone. I downloaded it 
because I just wanted to see who 
would swipe right on me, I don’t 
actually want to do anything.” 
I shot Michael another more 
confused look about where this 
was all going. “Well, I swiped 
right on this cute girl and she 
messaged me! So I responded 
and she kept messaging me. She 
is here, downstairs, at the party. 
I really care about Sarah (his 
long-term girlfriend) and I don’t 
want to ruin things with her and 
if I stayed down there I think I 
would have made a decision that 
I would regret.”
The 
most 
immediate 
response I had to this situation 
was to think Michael was acting 
like just another scuzzy guy 
who was trying to cheat on his 
girlfriend — and maybe that was 
the truth. But, another part of 
me saw Michael tangled up in 
a much more complicated web 
composed of desire, cyberspace 
and reality. Michael and I 
always joke that the internet 
raised us. From a young age, 
both of us had nearly unlimited 
access to the computer and we 
quickly crafted virtual versions 
of ourselves.
The first virtual version of 
myself was my “Club Penguin” 
account; for Michael, it was 
“RuneScape.” 
In 
online 
gaming lobbies, people don’t 
have an identity they can be 
held 
accountable 
for. 
The 
other 
people 
are 
complete 

strangers who only know you 
by your username, creating a 
breeding ground for absurdity 
and unbounded speech. For 
many gamers, usually middle 
schoolers, this anonymity is 
an opportunity to say the most 
vulgar, disgusting and offensive 
things imaginable.
For someone like Michael, 
who still games on a near daily 
basis, this sophomoric behavior 
is 
no 
longer 
shocking 
or 
provocative in the cyberspace; 
Michael is completely numb 
to it. In a game lobby, people’s 
characters 
aren’t 
real 
and 
neither are the words that people 
speak into their microphones — 
dying in “Call of Duty” means 
nothing and no one is actually 
coming to your house to have 
relations with your mother, no 
matter how much they insist 
they already have.

Creating a character in an 
online game is an odd hybrid 
between reality and simulated 
non-reality. The people are 
real, as is everything they 
say, but the space in which 
these 
interactions 
occur 
is 
immaterial.
In 
cyberspace, 
someone 
can try new games, create new 
characters and say outrageous 
things as much as they want. 
The actions I take in one game 
have absolutely no bearings on 
the actions I take in another 
game; 
cyber 
identities 
are 
anonymous and separable.
For Michael, creating an 
account on Tinder was like 
downloading a new multiplayer 
game. He was just creating 
another virtual manifestation 
of his identity that wasn’t 
attached to his personhood. Or 
so he thought. Michael didn’t 
see 
his 
Tinder 
account 
as 
something that was real — he 
didn’t see it as something that 
could manifest itself in real life 
any more than “Fortnite” could. 
Under 
this 
view, 
Michael’s 

Tinder account was the same 
as looking longingly at someone 
in class or lurking on someone’s 
Instagram account — acting in 
the ambiguous space of desire, 
but not cheating. When Michael 
saw his Tinder match in person, 
the material reality of his 
situation set in. This was not the 
same type of cyber identity as 
“Fortnite” or “Runescape.”
A logical response to this 
might be to say that creating a 
Tinder account is much more 
similar to making a social media 
account than it is to creating 
a character in a video game. 
After all, social media accounts 
are 
virtual 
manifestations 
of real people, not simulated 
characters, 
and 
on 
Tinder, 
someone 
depicts 
their 
real 
self. 
Tinder, 
however, 
does 
not operate in the same space 
of visibility that Instagram 
and Facebook do. A Tinder 
account is not a public landing 
space where anyone can view 
your profile, you cannot use 
Google to see if someone has 
a Tinder; after swiping, an 
account can vanish into the 
cyberspace forever. Instagram 
and 
Facebook 
accounts 
are 
designed with the purpose of 
sharing the happenings of an 
internal life, while a Tinder 
account is designed with the 
purpose of creating a private 
life with someone else. In short, 
a Facebook account is always 
attached to a public image, 
while a Tinder account pursues 
a semi-anonymous and private 
interest.
In Michael’s state of shock 
and panic, he reached for the 
buoy that was my room so 
that his virtual identity didn’t 
drown his real identity. It is 
unclear if Michael’s story is 
just a contemporary recasting 
of an old narrative about a 
gluttonous man seeking to cheat 
on his girlfriend or if Michael 
really didn’t understand the 
material consequences of his 
Tinder account. Either way, it 
is becoming increasingly clear 
that our virtual selves are 
producing material realities on 
their own terms.

ADDISON BASSOCK | OP-ED

The dorm who cried wolf
A

s many may know, the 
fire alarm has been 
going off incessantly at 
the Mary Markley Residence 
Hall. While it can be considered 
simply an annoyance, many 
students believe it has become 
a danger. Even though we 
understand this dorm has not 
been renovated and the alarms 
can be set off purely by humidity 
rather than an actual fire, this is 
now a major hazard.
When the fire alarm goes 
off, sometimes even five times in 
the early hours of the morning, 
it causes students to initially 
be alarmed that it is a fire, then 
gradually understand it is a 
mistake. The third, fourth and 
fifth time the alarm sounds in 
one day are the times when the 
students begin to stop believing 
they need to leave the building. 
How is this dangerous? It is 
dangerous because of what 
could occur when there is 
actually a fire.
Last week, the alarms went 
off six times. I’ve spoken to 
numerous residents of Markley, 

who all admitted they stayed 
inside their rooms. And they 
were right to stay there — as 
soon as the alarm was turned off 
after thirty minutes of ringing, 
it went back on two minutes 
later, proving to these students 
it was only a mistake, due to the 
weather or some other accident. 
While these students were right 
this time, what happens when 
they are wrong? What happens 
when the alarm goes off for the 
11th time in three weeks and the 
students don’t leave, assuming 
it is another mistake from the 
humidity? What happens when 
hundreds of students stay in 
their rooms, only to eventually 
smell the smoke, hear the 
screams and realize this time it 
isn’t a mistake?
You can’t ask students to 
leave every time the alarm 
goes off. When the alarm goes 
off multiple times in a day, in 
a week, it causes students to 
stop believing. And this is a 
major concern for our safety. 
At the University of Michigan, 
our tuition money should be 

going 
toward 
researching 
ways to prevent the alarm 
going 
off 
from 
humidity. 
Maybe even some renovations 
are 
overdue 
because 
these 
issues of fire alarms being set 
off multiple times in a night 
are not happening in South 
Quad Residence Hall, West 
Quad Residence Hall, East 
Quad Residence or any other 
renovated building on campus. 
Furthermore, 
we 
are 
only 
students. With midterms this 
week, it is detrimental to our 
health if we don’t get the sleep 
we need. When studying until 
1:00 a.m. or 2:00 a.m., most 
students want to sleep a full 
seven to eight hours.
With alarms going off from 
5:30 a.m. to 6 a.m., then 7:00 
a.m. to 7:30 a.m., and so on, it 
greatly disrupts the sleep cycle 
we so desperately need.
For the health and safety of 
your students, we are begging 
for this issue to be fixed.

End the Rohinyga genocide

REED ROSENBACHER | COLUMN

Addison Bassock is a LSA freshman.

T

he Rohingya might be the 
world’s most persecuted 
minority 
group. 
The 
Rohingya are a predominantly 
Muslim 
ethnic 
group 
in 
Myanmar 
who, 
for 
decades, 
have lacked citizenship or any 
legal protections. In additon, 
their ability to access education 
and health care, to travel freely, 
practice their religion and marry 
has been deeply restricted. 
In August 2017, the Burmese 
army ramped up its persecution 
of Rohingyas to unprecedented 
levels. The Burmese military has 
systematically destroyed villages, 
raped 
women 
and 
executed 
thousands. The violence has 
pushed 
more 
than 
700,000 
Rohingyas to leave Myanmar, 
primarily for refugee camps 
in Bangladesh. A report by the 
United Nations Human Rights 
Council has determined that 
the violent acts of the Myanma 
military amount to genocide. 
With no apparent signs of the 
violence against the Rohingya 
lessening, 
and 
with 
some 
countries 
sending 
Rohingya 
refugees 
back 
to 
Myanmar, 
something needs be done.
America should use economic 
sanctions 
to 
compel 
the 
Myanma government to stop its 
persecution of the Rohingya. 
The sanctions could first target 
specific Burmese generals or 
government officials, like has 
been 
done 
against 
Russian 
officials. 
For 
more 
leverage, 
the sanctions could be broader, 
targeting sectors of industry, as 
was done by America against 
Iran. 
America could use the threat 
of precision military strikes 
against the Myanmar Army to 
deter violence. Actual precision 
military 
strikes 
against 
the 
Myanma 
military 
would 
be 
low risk for American air and 
naval personnel given the low 
capabilities 
of 
the 
Myanma 
military. If none of this works, a 
no-fly zone could be established 
in Rakhine state, where the 
vast 
majority 
of 
Rohingya 
live, as was successfully done 
in northern Iraq to protect 
Kurds from Saddam Hussein’s 
murderous Al-Anfal campaign. 
Following the Kurdish model, 
an autonomous zone could be 
established in Rakhine state to 
further protect the Rohingya. In 
a matter of weeks, the Rohingya’s 
situation could be more secure. 
It’s clear America is more than 
capable of helping the Rohingya. 
But 
why 
should 
America 
intervene to save the Rohingya in 
the first place?
Firstly, America should help 
the Rohingya for moral reasons. 
In a world as interconnected 
and informed as ours, there is 
no excuse to let mass murder 

go 
unhindered, 
especially 
considering the wealth of options 
America has for helping the 
Rohingya. But some will say 
that foreign policy needs to be 
rooted in realism and strategic 
interests, rather than solving 
humanitarian 
crises, 
which 
brings me to the second reason 
America should intervene in the 
Rohingya genocide: doing so 
would have strategic benefits.
Embracing humanitarianism 
would 
strengthen 
America’s 
global 
leadership. 
American 
leadership has shaped the rules-
based, liberal world order since 
World War II. The features 
of 
this 
liberal 
world 
order 
include free trade, deterrence 
of interstate war and adherence 
to international law and norms, 
all of which benefit Americans 
by making the world a wealthier 
and safer a place. But the liberal 
world order is under threat.

China is quickly growing in 
economic and military power. 
Eventually China will achieve 
parity, if not supremacy, over 
American 
economic 
and 
military power. China is already 
converting 
its 
increasing 
strength into global influence, in 
competition with the American-
led liberal world order. The Belt 
and Road Initiative seeks to 
invest in developing countries to 
solidify Chinese influence. China 
is increasing foreign investment 
in Europe with the same goal in 
mind, with surprising success. 
Military structures are being 
built on islands in the South 
China Sea, and Chinese naval 
vessels have been intimidating 
American ships trying to uphold 
freedom of navigation, which is 
crucial for free trade.
If Chinese power is greater 
than American power, America 
cannot rely on its might alone to 
influence international conduct 
over Chinese attempts to do the 
same. China’s global leadership, 
under its current government, 
would undermine and ultimately 
replace the liberal world order, 
bidding farewell to free trade 
and 
promoting 
dictatorships 
all over the world. This would 
make Americans and the rest 
of the world less wealthy and 
less safe. To save the liberal 
world order, America should 

reconfigure it to genuinely value 
humanitarianism.
In Henry Kissinger’s book 
“World Order,” he outlines how 
strong world orders are based 
on legitimacy and power. The 
American-led world order has 
been anchored in American 
power. 
America’s 
unmatched 
power allowed it to write the 
rules of the world order through 
the creation of organizations like 
the World Trade Organization 
and NATO. When countries 
gravely violate the rules of the 
world order, it is America that 
leads the charge against them, 
like in the First Gulf War when 
America led a coalition to eject 
Saddam Hussein from Kuwait.
Kissinger writes that force 
alone is not a stable recipe for 
world order. The world order 
set by the Congress of Vienna in 
1814 fell apart because it relied 
only on force. Legitimacy is also 
needed for a stable international 
system. 
America’s 
legitimacy 
as leader of the liberal world 
order stems from its professed 
fidelity 
to 
universal 
values 
such as democracy and human 
rights. But America has not been 
consistent in living up to those 
values. America has supported 
dictators who violate human 
rights and has on occasion 
violated the very rules it was 
instrumental in establishing, like 
when it invaded Iraq. America’s 
hypocrisy naturally undermines 
its 
legitimacy. 
America’s 
inconsistency gives critics of the 
liberal international legitimate 
reason to criticize and thus 
undermine it. Even America’s 
allies in Europe and Asia have 
at times become disillusioned by 
America’s failure to abide by the 
values it preaches.
There is nothing America 
can do to overcome China’s 
eventually superior economic 
and 
military 
strength. 
But 
by 
seriously 
adopting 
humanitarianism, 
America 
could bring greater legitimacy 
to the liberal world order. Desire 
for the preservation of human 
rights are universal. Agreeing to 
stop genocides from happening 
could be the beginning of a 
humanitarianism which would 
give the peoples and countries 
of the world reason to choose 
an American-led world order 
even as it is no longer the world’s 
superpower. 
A 
humanitarian 
and 
morally-motivated 
American world order could be 
a more attractive option than 
the autocratic realpolitik, which 
doesn’t even profess to consider 
human rights, that the Chinese 
government would offer.

Over the past few years, both students and administrators at the University of Michigan 
have addressed on-campus sexual assault through new policies and ongoing activism. 
More recently, the news cycle and broader times, however, the personal stories of 
individuals who have survived an assault can be lost in the bigger discussion.

With that in mind, the Opinion section has created a space in The Michigan Daily for 
first-person accounts of sexual assault and its corresponding personal, academic and 
legal implications. Submissions will be published as a series of personal accounts that 
show essential perspectives: those of the survivor.

SURVIVORS SPEAK: SUBMIT TO OUR SERIES


counterpart 
“Night” 
forces 
us to contemplate what we 
normally 
try 
and 
shuffle 
into the periphery. The stage 
is dark except for a long, 
rectangular table where four 
men sit. One recalls the time 
when his squad, during a war, 
invaded a home and killed 
an entire family until “no 
life remained in the house 
— a ‘family unit’ had been 
eliminated.” Another talks of 
killing two rapists in a tunnel 
and seeing the life leave their 
eyes. Dialogues like these 
made me want to clap my 
hands over my ears and shut 
myself out from the world. 
No one wants to hear these 
things. No one wants to relive 
how terrible the world can be 
every single day. But topics 
like these are discussed so 
frequently in Mee’s work that 
they become normalized. 
Mee’s constant portrayal 
of 
death 
and 
destruction 
raises an important question: 
Is 
modern 
human 
society 
actually civilized? If making 
a comparison to prior foraging 
societies, for example, most 
would say yes. We now have 
agriculture: 
a 
means 
to 
produce our own food instead 
of obtain it elsewhere. We have 

technology and science, but 
with our capacity to kill and 
hate, how are we any different 
from 
those 
we 
consider 

“uncivilized?” 
Our 
human 
nature is the same at its roots; 
we are still capable of war, and 
we still have insecurities. We 
now have complex societies 
linking us together, but very 

little has changed.
During 
“Night,” 
an 
“uncivilized” man caked in 
charcoal and blood moves 
in slow motion about the 
stage, contorting in different 
positions among the feet of the 
“civilized” dressed in suits. 
While the civilized feast and 
clatter their spoons and forks, 
the “uncivilized” man doesn’t 
join, but instead remains at 
their feet like a servant. He 
tries to confront a “civilized” 
man, approaching him slowly 
and purposefully, but ends up 
falling into his arms instead in 
surrender: The “uncivilized” 
is no match for our modern 
world.
In Mee’s world, however, 
civilization 
and 
societal 
structure is the true enemy. 
The less coherent the world 
is, the better. “Night and Day” 
is purposefully jumbled up 
because there is security in 
expression that ignores the 
constraints 
and 
stigma 
of 
the world we like to consider 
“civilized.” 
Sometimes 
the 
world makes the most sense 
when there’s nothing holding 
us back. 
“Night 
and 
Day” 
will 
continue to run Oct. 11-14 at 
the Arthur Miller Theater. 

“Night and Day” is not 
your typical play. There is no 
damsel in distress, no heroic 
prince to come to the rescue 
and no sorcerer casting spells. 
It is not exactly a tragedy or 
a comedy. There is no naïve 
Juliet blinded in search of love 
and no handsome Romeo, bold 
and daring. “Night and Day” 
makes you uncomfortable, not 
content. The result is what you 
have left after peeling away 
the browning outer layers of 
an onion: raw flesh and rich 
substance. 
Charles 
Mee, 
the 
revolutionary playwright of 
“Night and 
Day,” 
declares 
that: 
“There 
is 
no 
such 
thing as an original play.” 
This production is a part of 
Mee’s 
“(re)making 
project” 
which focuses on weaving 
together multiple plays while 
maintaining 
originality 
in 
abstract 
interpretations 
of 
them. “Night and Day” is a 
joint 
collaboration 
by 
the 
School 
of 
Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance’s 
Department 
of 
Theatre and Drama and the 

National Academy of Theater 
Arts in Krakow, Poland, and 
is directed by Malcolm Tulip 
and Dominika Knapik. 

“Night and Day” is messy 
and disjointed. There are no 
firmly developed characters. 
Instead, ensemble members 
assume different roles for 
each 
scene. 
Most 
of 
the 

interpretation is up to the 
audience. 
The play opens with a 
woman dreamily proclaiming 
that Mee’s version of “Day,” 
based 
on 
“Daphnis 
and 
Chloe” by Greek romanticist 
Longus, and “Night,” based on 
“Thyestes” by Roman tragic 
playwright Seneca, is version 
“2.0.” It’s new and improved, 
so to speak. It’s evident why: 
The entire production follows 
the plot of these ancient works 
only slightly. 
Minutes 
into 
“Day,” 
viewers 
are 
confronted 
with confessions from the 
ensemble concerning intimate 
portrayals of their sex lives 
and 
miscarriages, 
among 
other topics. One member 
talks 
for 
a 
full 
minute 
about his experience with 
a prostitute, including the 
exact amount he paid her 
and for what services. An 
uncomfortable silence follows 
each of these monologues. 
Awkward laughter fills the 
air with uncertainty. Mee has 
mastered the art of pushing 
uncomfortable topics to the 
forefront, making us question 
why we stigmatize them to 
begin with.

When you stand too close to 
the subway platform and feel the 
wind from the train breathe across 
your body, there is a moment 
where time pauses. Your stomach 
drops, your eyes widen and 
your heart skips a beat. In a split 
second, the rush is gone, the wave 
of heat you felt creep through you 
moments before subsides, but 
your heart keeps pounding, alert 
and on edge. This same surge 
of adrenaline is exactly what “A 
Star is Born” gifts its audience, 
an unexpected drop into a 
mesmerizing world of music and 
intimacy. Lady Gaga and Bradley 
Cooper’s collaboration is nothing 
short of wondrous, inexplicably 
captivating with every note sung 
and every gaze shared. Though a 
remake of a classic tale, Cooper’s 
film gracefully forges its own 
path and leaves us all stunned 
into a state of awe with its heart-
swelling chemistry, entrancing 
lyrics and a sense of electricity 
and vibrancy. 
Working in a restaurant by day 
and moonlighting as a supporting 
act singer in a local drag club, 
aspiring artist Ally (Lady Gaga, 
“American Horror Story”) is a far 
cry from living in the spotlight. 
Though independent, spirited 
and 
tremendously 
talented, 
Ally clearly grapples with her 
unconventional beauty, which 
has played its part in blocking her 
from breaking into the industry 
thus far. Her luck changes, 
however, when one fateful night, 
steady, down-to-earth celebrity 
musician Jackson “Jack” Maine 
(Bradley Cooper, “Silver Linings 
Playbook”) 
coincidentally 
staggers drunk into the drag bar 
where Ally is performing. The 
connection between the two is 
almost otherworldly, intense, yet 

pure. Mesmerized by Ally’s voice, 
Jack invites her out for a drink 
and, by the end of the night, asks 
her to accompany him to his show 
the next night. Ally’s life is turned 
upside down, as she is thrown 
into the limelight at Jack’s side 

and subsequently rocketed by her 
talent into a spotlight of her own. 

First 
things 
first, 
let 
us 
acknowledge 
that 
Gaga 
and 
Cooper are nothing short of 
sensational in this film. From 
the start, they delude us into 
thinking that what we are about 
to witness will be one musician’s 
rise to fame and another’s fall 
from it. But the real magic of “A 
Star is Born” is its tangibility. 
Gaga and Cooper personify Ally 
and Jack so deeply that we swear 
we could reach across the screen 
and touch them. The connection 
they share is between them and 
them alone, and though their 
relationship is challenged by 
Jack’s struggles with alcohol, 
they remain somehow untainted 
by the elements of lust, money 
and 
fakeness 
that 
surround 
them. Their love is not one 
manufactured for an audience, 
which is exactly why we can’t 
take our eyes off of the screen. 
Aside from making all of our 
hearts bleed in longing for a love 
like theirs, Cooper and Gaga’s 
musical chops, both solo and in 
tandem, craft a soundtrack of gold. 
As a six-time Grammy winner, 
Gaga isn’t exactly a novice in the 
singing department. However, 
this makes her performance as 
Ally no less powerful. Unlike 

popular pieces from Gaga’s body 
of work, when she performs live 
as Ally up on stage, we get a taste 
of her voice without an ensemble 
of 
synthesizers 
and 
other 
instruments. And it is staggering. 
Her passion behind every lyric 
she sings and every melodic note 
she hits echoes in our ears long 
after the screen goes black. Now, 
of course, we can’t forget about 
Cooper, who kicks of the film 
with a foot-thumping number 
that sends chills of excitement 
down 
our 
spines. 
Cooper’s 
throaty, country-rock style is 
harmonized 
alongside 
Gaga’s 
belting vocals and somehow it 
just works. Leaving the theater 
(after wiping away hysterical 
tears), we can’t refrain from 
immediately downloading every 
track on Spotify, prepared to 
put Gaga and Cooper’s blissful 
melodies on repeat. 
Evidence of Cooper’s brilliance 
as a director is the fact that never 
once do we look on screen and 
see Bradley Cooper, dazzling 
and uber-famous actor, and Lady 
Gaga, eccentric and fearless pop 
superstar. We see only Jack and 
Ally. Just as their characters’ 
love miraculously shadows them 
from the toxic culture of fame 
that surrounds them, Cooper 
and Gaga morph so convincingly 
into their roles that we forget 
any knowledge of their celebrity 
outside of the film, unable to see 
them as anything but two people 
hopelessly in love. One thing 
is for certain: What Gaga and 
Cooper have given us all with 
“A Star is Born” is timeless. We 
can’t shake the fantasy of a love 
so raw and real, just as we can’t 
erase the film’s haunting, yet 
stunning lyrics from our minds. 
Surging with emotional energy, 
the deepest of sorrow and the 
greatest of love, “A Star is Born” 
is a soul-shaking epic that is, quite 
simply, unmissable.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW
‘Night and Day’ is uncomfortably thought provoking

TRINA PAL
Daily Arts Writer

A few weeks ago news broke 
that the beloved animated series 
“Avatar: The Last Airbender” 
was to live on as a live-action 
reimagining, 
courtesy 
of 
Netflix. Fans who began having 
horrible flashbacks to the last 
time “Avatar” went live action 
were given reason to hope with 
the additional news that this 
time around the remake will be 
spearheaded by original creators 
Brian Konietzko and Michael 
Dante DiMartino. The cast won’t 
be whitewashed and will feature 
actors whose skin tone and 
nationality will properly reflect 
the roles they will be playing. 
This is all very exciting. But, as 
I’ve written many times before 
in this column, the question must 
be asked: Do we really need this?
“The Last Airbender” is easily 
one of the best children’s TV 
series of all time and some might 
go as far as to say it deserves 
to be considered on the list of 
the greatest scripted television 
shows 
period. 
I 
recently 
re-watched the majority of the 
series and it held up even better 
than I remembered. Practically 
everything that goes into telling 
a story in the visual medium, 
from character to plot to music 
to visual design, was done to 
absolute perfection. Spanning 
only three seasons (or “books,” 
as they were stylized in the 
universe), the story has continued 
with a spin-off TV show, “The 
Legend of Korra,” as well as a 
number of books and comics. 
With such an expansive world 
at their disposal, it seems like 
the creators could have brought 
the show to Netflix with a new 
story instead of just a re-telling 
of one we’ve already seen, but 
I suppose there wouldn’t be as 
much money in that.
I’m approaching this reboot 
with trepidation. On one hand, 

it seems impossible that it could 
possibly any worse than the M. 
Night Shyalaman movie “The 
Last Airbender,” which is widely 
regarded as one of the worst films 
of the 21st century. On the other 
hand, it is also hard to imagine 
how this new series could ever 
be better than the original. The 
original show was basically 
perfect on its own, so what more 
could really be done with the 
story and characters that wasn’t 
done 
before? 
The 
“Avatar” 

storyline also worked well in 
the serialized format of old-
school TV, where episodes would 
release every week with long 
gaps, at times, between episodes, 
adding to the experience of 
journeying and growing with 
these characters. It’s possible the 
travelogue nature of the series 
will fall a bit flat if whole seasons 
are released at a time, as is the 
Netflix way.
All that aside, the potential is 
there. The children who grew 
up watching the Nickelodeon 
cartoon are now in their late 
teens or early 20s, and the 
potential to grow the show with 
the audience in a similar way to 
other generational series such 
as Star Trek is clearly there. The 
original episodes featured their 

fair share of dark content but 
also shied away from the concept 
of death and at times sugar 
coated certain aspects of the 
genocidal war that was taking 
place in order for the show to be 
appropriate for children. This 
live-action Netflix need not place 
such restrictions on itself.
The 
other 
big 
question 
hanging over the revival of 
“Avatar” is the status of former 
head writer Aaron Ehasz. Ehasz 
was the head writer for the 
entirety of the series and appears 
to have been an influential part 
of the writing that made the 
show a cut above the rest of early 
2000s children’s programming. 
Strangely enough, Ehasz recently 
debuted 
his 
own 
serialized 
animated series on Netflix that 
was hailed by many as the next 
“Avatar.” “The Dragon Prince” 
came out on Netflix this past 
September and quickly gained a 
following, although it’s a far cry 
from “Avatar.” “Prince” has been 
renewed for a second season, so 
whether or not that will preclude 
Ehasz from working on the new 
“Avatar” remains to be seen.
In this age of never-ending 
stories, 
“Avatar: 
The 
Last 
Airbender” 
remained 
the 
pinnacle of how to tell a story 
correctly. The three books of 
Water, Earth and Fire were a very 
clear beginning, middle and end. 
There was at most one important 
remaining question at the end of 
the series and all character arcs 
were fulfilled in an extremely 
satisfying way. With the brand 
recognition and sheer popularity 
of the franchise, it was unlikely it 
was going to be gone forever, but a 
live-action reboot of the original 
story might not necessarily be 
what fans were hoping for. Only 
time will tell if this new version 
of Aang’s story will be worth the 
trouble.

Ghostface Killah was a founding 
member of the Wu-Tang Clan. The 
Wu-Tang Clan was founded in 
1993. Thus, Ghostface Killah has 
been musically active since 1993. 
That’s a 25-year career. That’s a 
long time.
Reinvigorating 
East 
Coast 
rap with his hard-nosed squad, 
Ghostface and the Wu-Tang Clan 
were extremely important 25 years 
ago. Dr. Dre’s The Chronic had just 
stripped away New York’s hip-hop 
credentials, and the rap world was 
fully embracing the West Coast’s 
lighter-hearted G-funk, save a few 
hits from The Notorious B.I.G. 
In response, the Wu-Tang Clan 
delivered music that sonically 
combatted 
the 
groove-rap 
flourishing in Los Angeles; their 
sound was dark, brash, cold and 
still authentically New York.
Throughout his career as a solo 
artist, Ghostface Killah has stuck 
to this mold religiously. Even 
modern spins, like his collaborative 
album with eerie jazz group 
BadBadNotGood, 
played 
into 
his ’90s wheelhouse. His most 
recent release, The Lost Tapes, is 
no exception. Introduced by tired 
comedian, 
Michael 
Rapaport, 
the project is described as “dusty 

soul,” a full embrace of its stark 
contrast with modern hip hop. 
Even the album’s title has a vintage 
connotation. Track after track, 
Ghostface raps in static aggression 
over grandiose soul-sampling beats 
at 90 beats per minute.
“Buckingham 
Palace” 
starts 
with a sample that sounds like it’s 
played through a phonograph, 
and, 
shortly 
after, 
Ghostface 

begins to half-shout in a monotone 
timbre over the same beat for the 
remainder of the track. “Saigon 
Velour” also starts with a sample 
that sounds like its played through 
a phonograph, and shortly after, 
Ghostface begins to half-shout in 
a monotone timbre over the same 
beat for the remainder of the track 
(except this one has Snoop Dogg in 
it). “Watch Em Holla” also starts 
with a sample that sounds like it’s 
played through a phonograph — 
you get the gist.
To clarify, there is nothing 
wrong with this mold. It made 
for some of the most iconic 
music in hip-hop history, and its 
compressed, “dusty” nature makes 
for a very cozy listen. It’s just very 

obviously a 25-year-old mold, void 
of all of the distinct qualities of 
modern rap: no vocal inflections, 
no repetitive cadences, no dynamic 
beats driven by the potential of 
digital production.
The lack of these contemporary 
characteristics 
is 
obviously 
understandable; 
the 
era 
in 
which 
Ghostface 
thrived 
is 
vastly different from today. He 
acknowledges hip hop’s evolution 
and his consequential irrelevance 
on “Reflections of C.R.E.A.M. 
(Interlude 2)”: “It’s a new wave 
of children that’s up. Music is 
different... If we would’ve came 
out with C.R.E.A.M. right now, 
we wouldn’t have gotten played.” 
If anything, the rapper should be 
lauded for acknowledging his age 
and sticking to his proven sound, 
as opposed to dangerously denying 
his diminished importance by 
forcefully implementing modern 
sounds that end up sounding 
unauthentic (see: Snoop Dogg’s 
atrocious Make America Crip 
Again).
Ghostface’s The Lost Tapes 
should be the how-to-guide for 
any dated rapper. Instead of trying 
and failing to reinvent yourself, 
embrace the fact that your new 
music is no more than a nostalgic 
window to hip hop’s past and the 
relevance you used to hold. Let the 
kids handle the new stuff and save 
your reputation. 

Ghostface Killah is old, 
and he’s okay with that

ALBUM REVIEW

Helen 
Simpson’s 
2015 
collection 
of 
short 
stories, 
“Cockfosters: 
Stories” 
is 
preoccupied with the ordinary. 
Each story takes place over a 
short period of time — often no 
more than an hour or two — and 
in most, there is little physical 
or external action.
Simpson 
deftly 
balances 
narrative and interiority in 
these small compartments of 
time. Each story is both dull 
and 
thrilling, 
slow-moving 
and 
blindingly 
insightful. 
The strongest stories in the 
collection are about gender, 
a theme on which Simpson 
delivers 
startling 
insights 
through various unremarkable 
men and women.
Perhaps the best story in 
the collection is “Erewhon,” 
a 
delightful 
skewering 
of 
gendered 
expectations 
and 
dynamics. The title is a nod to 
Samuel Butler’s 1872 novel, the 
setting of which is a satirized 
Victorian society.
In “Erewhon,” a middle-
aged man lies awake in the very 
early hours of the morning. 
He 
ponders 
the 
emotional 
distance that has developed 
between him and his wife and 
hopes to transition to part-
time work. The first page of 
“Erewhon” 
seems, 
at 
first 
glance, unremarkable. Slowly, 
though, the subversive nature 
of the story emerges. “Not nice 
to think how the overwhelming 
majority of men who were 
murdered were murdered by 
their own wives,” the narrator 
says darkly.
The strength of “Erewhon” 

is how ordinary the world 
it creates is — no detail is 
outlandish, 
except 
for 
the 
premise of the gender-swap 
itself. All the cultural and 
social expectations and norms 
associated with women are now 
applied to men, and vice versa. 
“It was hard,” the narrator 
says, “the way older women got 
better with age while men lost 
their sexual allure … Nobody 

really respects a man anymore 
once he turns 40, particularly if 
he’s losing it on top.”
Simpson slickly pokes fun at 
the heavily gendered aspect of 
the real world by maneuvering 
the sad, frustrated protagonist 
of “Erewhon” through assorted 
machinations. “In a pathetic 
attempt to fight back, he’d 
recently been engaging on a 
spot of newsagent guerrilla 
warfare,” 
Simpson 
writes. 
“Now when he bought his paper 
he made sure to stick some of 
his preprepared Post-it to the 
naked boys on the covers of 
women’s magazines — notes he 
had felt-tipped in advance with 
the words WHAT IF HE WAS 
YOUR SON?”
In 
the 
other 
stories 
in 
“Cockfosters,” Simpson builds 
recognizable worlds. In this 
way, she gains our trust in 
her ability to assemble places 
and people we might know. In 

“Erewhon,” Simpson applies 
her trademark vigilance to an 
imagined place, one whose 
inversions bring to light that 
which is painfully familiar but 
also often obscured by its own 
routineness.
While sometimes verging on 
the ridiculous — the narrator 
talks about driving his daughter 
around the country for her 
competitive yoga tournaments 
— “Erewhon” is a masterful 
demolition of the pressures 
women are constantly under. 
“Don’t be such a MascuNazi,” 
the narrator’s wife says.
“That 
was 
what 
really 
worried him — him and the 
other 
dads,” 
the 
narrator 
explains. “They all agonized 
endlessly about whether or not 
they were good fathers.” Or: 
“He wasn’t overjoyed about 
still being on the Pill. All four 
of his grandparents had died 
of strokes or heart attacks, but 
Ella couldn’t tolerate condoms. 
‘They 
muffled 
things,’ 
she 
said.”
Upon completion, it becomes 
clear that “Erewhon” is not 
quite a satire; it’s devoid of the 
amplification that defines the 
genre. There is no exaggeration, 
just a sleight of hand that 
exposes the world for what it is, 
and what it has always been.
“The world was woman-
shaped — get over it!” Simpson 
writes. 
Reading 
“Erewhon” 
in 2018 is perhaps different 
than reading it when it was 
originally published in 2015. 
Brett Kavanaugh was appointed 
to the Supreme Court this 
week, despite multiple credible 
accusations of sexual assault.
“This was the way things 
were,” writes Simpson. “This 
was the natural order.”

If 
you 
can 
recall 
my 
review last week, I made an 
impassioned argument in favor 
of giving network television a 
chance. And, well, how should 
I put this?
I take everything back.
A lot can change in a week. 
For example, last week I still 
held onto the wild, optimistic 
notion that regardless of how 
shitty the quality of a show is, 
there must be someone behind 
the scenes that gives at least 
a sliver of a care about what 
type of product is presented 
to the world. Well, ladies and 
gentlemen, that was last week. 
CBS’s newest comedy, “The 
Neighborhood,” premiered this 
week.
From creator Jim Reynolds 
(I want everyone to know his 
name), “The Neighborhood” is 
simply one of the worst things 
I have ever watched. The show 
is a classic fish-out-of-water 
tale, and by “classic” I mean 
“would have been topical in 
1976.” Dave (Max Greenfield, 
“New Girl”), a professional 
conflict mediator from Mich., 
runs into a big conflict of his 
own when he and his family 
relocate to a predominantly 
Black neighborhood in Los 
Angeles 
and 
aren’t 
exactly 
given a warm welcome. Did I 
mention Dave was white? Did 
I mention the neighbors were 
Black? You’re going to want to 
remember that, because it’s not 
like they mention it every 30 
seconds. Essentially, Dave just 
wants to be friends with his new 
neighbors, but is thwarted from 
this goal by Calvin (Cedric the 
Entertainer, “The Last O.G.”), 
the patriarch of the family 
next door. Calvin, whose job, 
ostensibly, is to wear oversized 
Chaps polos and pace around 
angrily, wants nothing to do 

with Dave because — oh wait, 
it’s never explained. Everyone 
just assumes it’s about race. 
Which it is. Oh wait, it isn’t? No, 
it definitely is. And that’s the 
show!
The 
show’s 
treatment 
of 
conflict could be likened to a 
child trying its hardest to fit a 
circle block in a square hole: 
It is repetitive; it is frustrating 

for onlookers who know better 
and it feels easily solvable. But, 
alas, with CBS’s track record 
for 
continuously 
renewing 
mediocre content well after its 
expiration date (looking at you, 
“Big Bang Theory”), we may 
just have to watch this one-
dimensional 
conflict 
stretch 
over seven seasons.
The show’s issues do not stop 
at its weak premise. Like many 
other 
fish-out-of-water 
tales 
that have preceded it, “The 
Neighborhood” 
requires 
the 
audience to suspend some of 
their disbelief to conclude why 
two opposites would ever come 
into contact, and further, why 
they are forced to stay in contact 
with one another. Unlike “The 
Nanny” or even “The Beverly 
Hillbillies” who have set-ups 
somewhat based in reality, “The 
Neighborhood” gives us no 
explanation as to why a family as 
vanilla as Dave’s would choose 
to move to this predominantly 
Black neighborhood that hasn’t 
even begun to show the first 
signs of gentrification. The 
characters on the show do not 
speak like humans. Every line 

of dialogue is tailor-made to fit 
between insufferable drags of 
the laugh track. On top of that, 
the tonality is erratic. Shortly 
after making a joke about a 
neighborhood crackhead, Nick 
goes off on a legitimate tangent 
about how the opioid epidemic 
has shown him that addicts 
are victims. Which is true. But 
what?
Worst of all, the show takes 
itself entirely too seriously. 
Jim Reynolds and company 
actually carry this show as 
though they are at the vanguard 
of a new racial discourse in 
America, when in actuality they 
are peddling the same ideas 
that have been in circulation 
since the ’90s. Yet, rather 
than refining those ideas, they 
somehow do it with less tact. In 
this episode, a Black character 
actually has to break down the 
idea that Black people can’t be 
racist. And he is treated like 
he’s being the stubborn one. 
I know CBS’s target audience 
is the AARP crowd, but come 
on. Aren’t we tired of hearing 
this same thing? Aren’t we 
tired of white people’s aversion 
to educating themselves on 
systemic racism being treated 
as a punchline? A punchline 
that is, conicidentally, written 
by a white man. Similarly to the 
comedy of the show, Reynolds 
cannot seem to figure out what 
he wants the show to be. Is it 
a commentary on the tone-
deafness of the “colorblind” 
millennial generation, or is it 
simply just a vehicle for a bunch 
of white guys to test out “Black 
People Be Angry” jokes? No 
matter what the answer truly 
is, the result appears to be the 
latter. In the same way that 
Dave simply being in a Black 
neighborhood 
will 
not 
end 
racial tensions there, merely 
placing Black people in dated, 
buffoonish roles does nothing 
to end the diversity issue in 
Hollywood.

‘The Neighborhood’ is in 
dire need of a renovation

Wangler proves progress with first touchdown

With a little more than six 
and a half minutes left in the 
fourth quarter of the Michigan 
football 
team’s 
win 
over 
Maryland on Saturday, Jared 
Wangler trotted onto the field 
and into the offensive huddle.
Per usual, the fifth-year 
senior fullback was joined by 
his position partner, sophomore 
Ben 
Mason. 
And 
while 
Wangler knew 
there 
were 
a 
variety 
of 
plays 
that 
could be run 
with 
both 
fullbacks, 
it 
wasn’t 
until 
junior 
quarterback 
Shea Patterson 
called the play that Wangler 
knew he was going to score.
Moments 
later, 
the 
12th-ranked Wolverines broke 
the huddle. Patterson got the 
snap, and he faked to Mason 
while Wangler leaked into the 
flat. Patterson rolled out and 
hit Wangler near the goal line, 
who fell into the endzone with 
the ball.
“When I caught it, I didn’t 
really know if I was in the 
endzone 
or 
not,” 
Wangler 
said. “But when I saw the 
blue endzone, that’s just kind 
of when I knew. And then, 
obviously, I got pretty juiced 
up after that. I was pretty 
excited.”
That’s when the celebrations 
began. First, as Wangler said, 
he got juiced up, yelling into 
the Michigan Stadium crowd 
while his teammates mobbed 
him in the corner of the 
endzone.
Then he made his way to 
Michigan’s sideline, where he 
was met by all the players who 
have known him over the last 
five years, going crazy for a 
fifth-year senior’s first career 

touchdown.
Wangler’s 
brother, 
Jack 
Wangler, who played for the 
Wolverines from 2013 to 2017, 
had made his way down to the 
front row. Wangler celebrated 
with 
him, 
too, 
for 
good 
measure.
“It was awesome to see 
that,” said senior wide receiver 
Grant Perry, who played with 
Jared in middle school. “You 
know, he’s worked so hard, and 
it was just really 
happy. 
All 
the 
guys were really 
happy for him.”
Wangler’s first 
touchdown isn’t 
exactly a shocker 
— he has played 
increasingly 
more 
snaps 
as 
the season has 
advanced.
Still, even with 
the rest of the season to go, the 
play gave Wangler somewhat 
of a punctuation on a career 
that has been anything but 
routine.
Wangler, 
whose 
dad, 
John, 
is 
a 
former 
Wolverinesquarterback, came 

to Michigan as a three-star 
safety.
Since then, Wangler has 
gone through the firing of 
Brady Hoke — the coach he 
committed to — a position 
change to fullback and even 
a knee injury over this past 
summer.
All that turmoil has driven 
Wangler in to work harder, to 
prove he belongs.
“It feeds in a lot,” Wangler 
said. 
“You 
know, you go 
through 
the 
ups and downs, 
you don’t quite 
play as much as 
you anticipate 
on, like, early 
on 
in 
your 
career. 
And, 
yeah, it’s just 
something that 
sticks to you. 
You really want to be out there 
and contribute for the team, 
and you’re in here busting 
your butt every day just like 
everyone else. So yeah, that’s 
something that plays into it.”
One of the unknown pieces 
of turmoil for Wangler was 

revealed 
on 
Tuesday 
via 
Wangler’s Instagram account.
He 
posted 
a 
picture 
of 
himself 
celebrating 
in 
the 
endzone 
with 
Mason, 
captioned, “ ‘You will never 
play here at Michigan’ -DJ 
Durkin (2015)”
Durkin is the Terrapins’ head 
coach — though he is currently 
on administrative leave — and 
was the Wolverines’ defensive 
coordinator in 2015.
“I guess it’s 
just something I 
appreciated that 
he did for me 
early on in my 
career, was, you 
know, 
he 
was 
tough on me,” 
Wangler 
said. 
“He’s 
a 
tough 
coach. 
That’s 
just kind of his 
style. 
So 
that 
quote just kind of always stuck 
with me in my head, and that’s 
just one of those things, like 
I mentioned earlier, you just 
have to prove people wrong. 
So, you know, I appreciated 
that, that he gave me that extra 
incentive.”

Fifth-year senior fullback Jared Wangler scored his first career touchdown against Maryland on Saturday.

“When I caught 

it, I didn’t really 

know if I was in 

the end zone.”

“I appreciated

Nothing much has changed after slow start

It’s a case of expectations 
versus reality.
One would expect the No. 
4 Michigan hockey team to 
beat a Vermont team that went 
10-20-7 last season. But reality 
says otherwise.
Similarly, one might expect 
the 
Wolverines’ 
in-practice 
adjustments 
to 
address 
struggles seen in the opening 
game of the season.
Well, reality, once again, 
says 
otherwise. 
Nothing’s 
really 
changed. 
Attitudes, 
maybe, 
but 
Michigan 
is 
sticking to its system, trusting 
that the problems that surfaced 
during 
the 
loss 
will 
sort 
themselves out through time 
and experience.
“I 
really 
don’t 
think 
anything needs to be changed 
to be honest with you,” said 
sophomore center Josh Norris. 
“Compete has been one of 

the things mentioned a lot 
by (Pearson) and I know its 
something he takes a lot of 
pride in, and that’s how he 
wants the team to play, so I 
think as long as we’re really 
competitive 
every 
night, 
I 
think we have 
enough talent for 
the rest to take 
care of itself.”
The 
only 
difference 
in 
the team, which 
showed in the 
Wolverines’ 
rebound game on 
Sunday 
against 
Waterloo, 
is 
the 
demeanor. 
They’ve 
seen 
rough 
starts 
before, so it’s nothing new. 
Instead, they’re focusing on 
shaking off the rust and getting 
acclimated to the systems in 
place that had propelled them 
to success late last season.
“I think it takes a little bit to 
get used to in a game situation,” 

said junior defensemen Griffin 
Luce. “And obviously we got 
surprised there a little bit quick 
early. After that we showed 
more growth, like you watch 
the second period, we didn’t 
give up any goals there, and the 
third 
period, 
we gave up one 
and the empty 
netter, 
but 
I 
think 
it 
was 
pretty evident 
our 
defensive 
zone got better 
through 
the 
game.”
Luce added: 
“It was a little 
bit of a learning 
curve for some guys.”
So, despite the loss, the 
status quo stayed the same. 
Practice didn’t need to be 
changed. It was the attitude 
that did it. It was the verbal 
cues. It was the intensity the 
team practiced with.
“We’re 
playing 
to 
our 

system, which is how we want 
to play. Being on them quick. 
Being aggressive,” Luce said.
And it’s the things that don’t 
need 
practice 
that 
require 
the most repetition. There 
were 
defensive 
drills, 
like 
every practice, but it was the 
communication during those 
drills that was stressed — one 
of the things Luce thought 
factored in the team’s loss. 
You can see defensive zone 
drills, but you have to hear the 
verbal cues to understand the 
difference from last week’s 
practice.
“Making 
sure 
that 
everyone’s 
communicating 
and on the same page in the 
defensive zone so that we can 
have a rock solid defense like 
we want,” Luce said. “Because 
we think that’s going to be 
the backbone of the team, and 
because offense comes off of 
defense, we need to sharpen up 
defensively and tighten up for 
sure.”

needs to be 
changed...”

Michigan practiced just the same as usual this week despite losing season opener
‘M’ defense makes it a 
contender in the B1G

Michigan was knocked from 
atop the Big Ten standings 
Sunday afternoon when No. 2 
Indiana (10-2 overall, 4-0 Big 
Ten) came to town.
The 2017 national runner-
up defeated the fourteenth-
ranked 
Wolverines 
(8-2-1, 3-1-1), 1-0, behind a 
clinical 
offensive 
display 
and a resolute and organized 
defensive 
performance. 
Though the game was evenly 
contested, 
ultimately, 
the 
Hoosiers 
were 
just 
better 
when they had to be.
“That was a pretty even, 
50-50 game,” said Michigan 
coach Chaka Daley. “They’re 
a pretty good team. There’s a 
reason there’s a number one on 
their jersey, but we’re a good 
team, too. That’s my takeaway. 
There’s no doubt we were 
challenged though.”
For 
the 
Wolverines, 
a 
noticeable bright spot was 
their 
defense. 
Indiana’s 
goal was scored off a broken 
Michigan attack where the 
full-backs were upfield, leaving 
the 
remaining 
defenders 
exposed at the back. The 
Hoosiers effectively worked 
their man advantage, and Rece 
Buckmaster placed it in the 
only spot he could have, beating 
sophomore goalkeeper Henry 
Mashburn to the far-post.
In 
the 
first 
half, 
the 
Wolverine defense thwarted 
countless Indiana attacks and 
dealt aptly with a barrage of 
crosses from Hoosier wingers.
The centerback pairing of 
senior Daniel Mukuna and 
sophomore 
Jackson 
Ragen 
seemingly didn’t put a foot 
wrong, 
making 
critical 
tackles within their box. The 
success 
and 
reliability 
of 
this partnership has been a 
developing trend for Michigan 
throughout this season and is 
one of the reasons the team 
held the top position in the Big 

Ten prior to Sunday’s game.
“They’re great players,” said 
junior attacker Jack Hallahan. 
“When someone scores a goal 
on them, they’re absolutely 
gutted and that shows a lot 
about their character. Those 
guys work really hard.”
Emphasis 
on 
“when 
someone scores on them.” The 
Wolverines have allowed just 
seven goals in 11 games this 
season, and contributed to 
five clean sheets. Ragen and 
Mukuna started at the back in 
all of these contests.
The two dependable and 
physically imposing central 
defenders 
are 
flanked 
normally 
by 
seniors 
Peter 
Brown and Marcello Borges, 
though versatile sophomore 
Austin Swiech has also seen 
significant time at full-back. 
This continuity at the back has 
had a favorable effect on the 
team as a whole.
“I think it’s really nice,” 
Hallahan said. “Especially as 
an attacker knowing we have 
such a solid defense behind 
us. It gives us the freedom up 
front to be creative.”
Despite 
the 
success, 
Michigan’s stellar defensive 
performances will have to 
continue if it hopes to rebound 
from the loss against Indiana. 
The Wolverine attack was 
ineffective against a superior 
opponent like the Hoosiers, 
especially when they packed it 
in late in the game.
Michigan’s 
remaining 
schedule doesn’t get any easier 
with No. 15 Notre Dame and 
No. 13 Michigan State still to 
come. The Wolverines will 
rely heavily on their defense, 
like they did against Indiana, 
to keep them in these games.
“We got this opportunity 
and we played a team of that 
caliber 
now,” 
Daley 
said. 
“Going 
down 
the 
stretch, 
we know what we are, and 
what we can continue to do 
and build upon. Learned a lot 
today, for sure.”

MEN’S SOCCER

Despite strong defense, 
Michigan defeated, 1-0

In a matchup of the Big Ten’s 
top two teams, the No. 14 Michigan 
men’s soccer team fell to No. 2 
Indiana in a defensive battle that 
ended with a final score of 1-0. 
Michigan (8-2-1 overall, 3-1-1 Big 
Ten), which entered the game riding 
a nine-game unbeaten streak, looked 
upon its defense to halt the Indiana 
attack, and through the majority 
of the game the back line held 
strong. But Indiana (10-2-0, 4-0-0) 
only needed one defensive lapse to 
capitalize.
Ten minutes into the second half, 
following 55 minutes of organized 
and composed defending by the 
Wolverines, the Hoosiers earned 
their chance to break the scoreless 
game open. Indiana midfielder 
Griffen Dorsey made a run into 
Michigan’s third of the field and 
slipped past two defenders to find 
midfielder Rece Buckmaster trailing 
behind in open space. With nobody 
marking him, Buckmaster fired 
the ball into the bottom corner of 
the net, past Michigan sophomore 
goalkeeper 
Henry 
Mashburn’s 
outstretched glove.
“In our moment of — if you call it 
a moment of weakness, it’s not really 
a moment of weakness — (Dorsey) 
does a good job,” said Michigan 
coach Chaka Daley. “He’s a big-time 
player, (he) tucks in, beats a guy, skips 
by (sophomore defender Jackson 
Ragen) and sets (Buckmaster) over 
here and he scores a great goal.”
Despite giving up the goal, 
Michigan’s 
defense 
remained 
composed 
and 
organized 
throughout the game. Ragen and 
senior defender Daniel Mukuna 
were especially impressive; both 
consistently 
making 
well-timed 
tackles, 
blocks 
and 
clearances 
that stalled Indiana’s attack time 
and time again, while both senior 
Marcello Borges and sophomore 
Austin Swiech did a good job of 
containing Indiana’s attack on the 

wings. Mashburn also had a solid 
game, tallying four saves.
Indiana’s back line found a way, 
however, to outshine Michigan’s and 
conceded no space for the attack to 
create meaningful chances. There 
were moments when Michigan 
tested the Hoosier defense, but these 
occasions were extinguished. 
“Down the stretch, while we 
had a lot of the ball, while we put 
them under duress, I don’t know if 
we really gave them a ton of, what 
I would call, stress or working 
the goalkeeper late in the game,” 
Daley said. “Although we had a lot 
of the ball, and we started to put 
it in, I think they did a good job of 
protecting the lead…But certainly 
we’re disappointed we didn’t find a 
way today.” 
Overall, the match was well-
balanced and competitive until 
the final whistle. Neither team 
dominated possession early on, as 
both played back-and-forth with 
each defense curtailing attacking 
chances. Indiana’s counter-attack 
showed flashes of danger at times, 
but the Wolverines maintained their 
shape and protected the net — until 
the goal in the 55th minute. 
After Indiana scored, though, 
Michigan adjusted its attack to be 
more proactive. With more urgency, 
the Wolverines got the ball into the 
box and did what they could, but 
Indiana conceded few opportunities 
other than a handful of chances that 
failed to test sophomore goalkeeper 
Trey Muse. 
“There’s nothing to improve 
upon, except just staying sharper, 
you know what I mean, in those big 
moments,” Daley said. “They played 
in the national final, they have 
five redshirt seniors, eight seniors 
starting. 
“When you kind of knock it down, 
it’s a pretty experienced group, and 
we had our way at ‘em. We had a go 
at them. They found a way today, and 
that’s what, you know, experience 
will do sometimes, and we’ll get 
better as a result of this.”

Tai Streets, Michigan and Brian Bowen: What you need to know

On Tuesday, Brian Bowen, 
Sr. — the father of former top 
men’s basketball recruit Brian 
Bowen, Jr. — testified in court 
that Amateur Athletic Union 
coach and former Michigan 
athlete Tai Streets gave the 
younger 
Bowen 
$5,000 
to 
play for Streets’ AAU team, 
Meanstreets.
Bowen, Jr., a focus of this 
week’s 
college 
basketball 
corruption trial because of 
numerous 
NCAA 
violations 
during his recruitment, was 
never reported to have any 
monetary 
offer 
from 
the 
Wolverines. However, Streets 
played 
on 
the 
Michigan 
football team from 1995-1999 
and the men’s basketball team 
in 1997. Because of that, he is 
considered a representative of 
the University under NCAA 
bylaws.
“Following testimony in a 
federal court today, a claim 
was made that a former U-M 
student-athlete offered money 
to 
a 
basketball 
player 
in 
exchange for participation on 
a youth team,” the Michigan 
athletic department said in 
a 
statement 
to 
The 
Daily. 
“Integrity 
in 
the 
college 
basketball 
environment 
is 
an 
important 
issue 
and 
we 
will 
continue 
to monitor this 
situation.” 
But 
what 
could 
the 
implications 
be 
for 
the 
Wolverines and what would 
they mean? The Daily spoke 
with business lawyer Richard 
Hoeg 
about 
the 
scandal’s 
possible 
impact 
on 
the 
University 
and 
its 
athletic 
department.

Why 
is 
Tai 
Streets 
considered a representative 
of the University?
The NCAA’s bylaws include 
provisions 
for 
people 
deemed 
“representatives 
of 
athletics 
interests” 
because 
people 
not 
directly 
associated with 
the 
program 
— players and 
coaches — may 
still 
have 
an 
interest 
in 
helping the athletic program. 
Such people can have an impact 
on recruiting.
Per bylaw 13.02.9, anyone who 
has been involved in promoting 
an institution’s (in this case 
Michigan’s) athletic program 

is considered a representative 
of 
athletics 
interests 
— 
a 
distinction 
he 
holds 
for 
life, even if he is no longer 
associated with 
the program.
“You 
might 
be able to argue 
that 
former 
players 
don’t 
fall fully under 
that paradigm,” 
Hoeg 
said. 
“ … But (the 
NCAA 
has) 
historically 
treated former 
players as representatives.”
Tai Streets paid Bowen 
to play on a youth team, not 
for the Wolverines. So why 
would that have implications 
for Michigan?
This is where the case gets 

a little bit more complicated. 
Technically, representatives of 
athletics interests must follow 
all the same rules with regards 
to recruiting as 
those 
directly 
affiliated 
with 
the 
program. 
However, 
that’s 
nearly impossible 
in practice due 
to 
restrictions 
on 
when 
representatives 
can and cannot 
have 
contact 
with high school 
athletes.
“(A 
representative 
of 
athletics interests) should not 
recruit a prospective student-
athlete except as permitted 
by NCAA rules (but) it can’t 
be applied fully as broadly as 

it might look,” Hoeg said. “ … 
Because to do that would be to 
limit any graduate that had a 
scholarship at some point from 
working in a high 
school, ever.”
The way the 
rule is applied, 
the 
question 
becomes whether 
Streets 
ever 
specifically 
recruited Bowen 
to play for the 
Wolverines. 
Streets 
could 
have 
violated 
that rule even if Bowen was never 
offered money by Michigan if 
Streets promoted the school to 
Bowen, but there has so far been 
no evidence that he did so.
If Michigan is implicated 
in the case, what would the 

punishment be?
Were the Wolverines to be 
punished, it would be because 
the 
athletic 
department 
is 
deemed responsible for all its 
representatives. In essence, it’s 
the University’s responsibility 
to make sure that boosters and 
former players don’t commit 
recruiting violations.
There is no set punishment 
for violations of this type — not 
to mention that we don’t know 
what the extent of the violations 
would be. However, if there was 
a punishment, it would likely 
be fairly minor, especially since 
Michigan coach John Beilein has 
a reputation as one of the cleanest 
coaches in college basketball.
“(Michigan) could get in front 
of it by essentially disavowing Tai 
Streets as a representative,” Hoeg 
said. “ … I think it unlikely to be 
more than a fine. We’re definitely 
not talking scholarships. Had the 
player in question played here, 
we might be talking about loss of 
eligibility and vacation of wins 
and things like that.”
That’s where there is one 
potential snag. Redshirt junior 
guard Charles Matthews and 
sophomore forward Isaiah Livers 
both played on Meanstreets 
under Streets. Neither player 
has been mentioned by the 
investigation 
and 
there 
is 
no 
evidence 
that 
Streets 
committed 
NCAA violations 
with 
regards 

to 
their 

recruitments. 
However, 
because 
of 
Streets’ 
affiliation 
with 
Michigan, it is likely something 
the NCAA will look into. If an 
investigation found violations, 
there would be much bigger 
implications for the Wolverines. 
There is currently no evidence 
that was the case.

The Michigan basketball team came under question Tuesday after former Michigan athlete Tai Streets was named for paying players to join his AAU team.

Brian Bowen Sr., testified in court that former Michigan athlete Tai Streets gave Brian Bowen Jr., $5,000 to play for his AAU team

“... we will 
continue to 
monitor the 
situation.”

“... it can’t be 
applied fully 
as broadly as it 
might look.”

“I think it 
unlikely to be 
more than a

Bell ahead of schedule at receiver, quieting recruiting doubters

Ronnie Bell grips the straps 
on his backback and smiles. He’s 
asked about recruiting rankings.
“Stars, I mean,” he says with a 
noticeable snarl. “Can’t always pay 
attention to stars.”
A year ago, Bell was a two-star 
basketball recruit, committed to 
play at Missouri State. There was 
an itch to play football, the sport 
he’s always preferred, but the 
interest wasn’t mutual. 
“Every week I attacked high 
school football with everything I 
had because I was trying to earn 
a scholarship from somebody,” 
Bell said Tuesday evening. “But 
nobody wanted anything to do 
with me.”
What a difference a year makes.
Saturday 
against 
Maryland, 
Bell caught a pass over the middle 
and ran for a 22-yard score — his 
second touchdown of this season 
in which the freshman receiver 

has played in all six games.
After the game, Bell spoke to a 
long-time friend via text about just 
how far he’s come in such a short 
time.
“He was like, ‘Man, a year 
ago today I was on the sideline 
talking to your 
dad 
about 
you 
playing basketball 
at 
Missouri 
State. Now you 
just 
scored 
a 
touchdown,’ 
” 
Bell 
recalled. 
“Just 
crazy 
to 
think how much it 
switched.”
He’s far ahead 
of where anyone 
could have predicted, and in the 
process is stomping all over those 
who doubted him. Bell saw early 
in one-on-one drills in fall camp 
he could compete at this level. 
Soon after, the rest of the team 
took note as well.
Sophomore receivers Donovan 

Peoples-Jones, Tarik Black and 
Nico Collins were among the first 
to see it.
“A lot of people learn, especially 
once you get here, stars aren’t 
anything once you’re here,” Bell 
said. “Once DP, Rik and Nico, all 
them realized I 
can play, they all 
took 
me 
under 
their wing and 
were willing to 
build me up.”
Black 
and 
Collins 
were 
four-star recruits. 
Peoples-Jones 
was a consensus 
five-star.
But Bell says 
nobody helped him out more than 
senior receiver Grant Perry. Each 
day after camp, Perry and Bell 
would go back to the hotel and act 
out plays in the room.
“We got the freakin’ couch and 
pillows all set up and I’m running 
around lining up,” Bell said. “He 
got me right over fall camp.”
Bell was hungry — maybe 

moreso 
than 
your 
average 
freshman. This was as much about 
proving to himself that he made 
the right decision as any external 
validation.
It’s still not lost on Bell just how 
close he was to a starkly different 
path. 
Had 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim Harbaugh not 
stumbled upon his 
tape through his 
brother-in-law, 
Bell might well be 
playing basketball 
at Missouri State 
or 
football 
at 
a 
far 
different 
level. When he 
finally 
decided 
on football, there were schools in 
contact with him — his hometown 
Division-II Northwest Missouri 
State being one — but certainly no 
program the caliber of Michigan. 
When 
Harbaugh 
and 
the 
Wolverines came calling, though, 
the decision became easy.
“It was a dream come true,” 
Bell said. “It made me feel a lot 

more better about my decision, of 
course. I want to play football, I 
want to prove to everybody I could 
play football. Coming in, it was 
like now I’m really going to show 
y’all.”
Bell 
has 
indeed 
shown 
everyone. 
Few 
have 
taken more pride 
in Bell’s success 
than Director of 
Recruiting 
Matt 
Dudek. 
Dudek 
and the coaching 
staff 
received 
some 
backlash 
shortly after Bell’s 
commitment from 
fans questioning 
the commitment. 
Bell was off everyone’s radar. So 
when Michigan offered, plenty of 
skepticism followed.
After both games in which Bell 
has scored, against Nebraska and 
Maryland, Dudek has taken to 
Twitter to gloat.
After his 56-yard touchdown 
against the Cornhuskers, Dudek 

tweeted “Zero-star Ronnie Bell 
#FromTheSideline 
#GoBlue 
#Winningest”
After Bell’s score against the 
Terrapins, Dudek tweeted “Man, 
if only Ronnie Bell had more stars, 
ugh #GoBlue #Winningest”
Harbaugh 
also 
spoke 
approvingly of Bell’s performance 
against 
Maryland, 
offering 
a 
comment unprovoked in his post-
game press conference.
“How about my guy, Ronnie 
Bell?”
There’s still plenty of room to 
improve for Bell, who has three 
catches on the year. His skill at 
receiver remains raw, despite the 
glimpses of talent. But for Bell, 
Dudek, Harbaugh and all involved, 
the first six games of Bell’s career 
are a recruiting triumph, with the 
potential for much more on the 
horizon.
“I just came in humbled,” Bell 
said. “I was ‘the basketball guy’ 
to everyone. My goal was to show 
everybody I could play football. 
For me to start out this way, it’s a 
great thing, great feeling.”

You Can’t Bury 

Canterbury

T

he recording starts 
with Bach’s “Toccata 
and Fugue in D Minor” 
on the organ — you’d 
know it if you heard 
it — with a minor 

modulation of pitch, a quiver. Then 
a voice rings out above the organ’s 
echo.

“Good evening.”
*organ intro repeats*
“This is Dan Burke of Canterbury 

House”

*organ once again*
“… bringing you some of the 

sounds of the good news.”

*large applause*
Some of them are weird sounds, 

some of them are sweet sounds 
and some of them are perplexing 
sounds.

Burke’s deep, rich voice is imme-

diately cut off by the first verse 
of Carl Anderson’s “Superstar” 
from the “Jesus Christ Superstar” 
soundtrack. If this recording of 
Reverend Burke’s radio show from 
1971 doesn’t convey Canterbury 
House’s blend of musical innova-
tion and spirituality, I don’t real-
ly know what could.

I

t was the first day of 
sophomore 
year, 
and 

my biggest concern was 

whether or not I would get a 
five on my first AP exam. A few 
seconds after the bell rang, in 
came Mr. Delap.

Mr. Delap was not an enigma, 

but there was certainly a legacy 
attached to him. He was my first 
teacher to ever, vocally, teach 
history without editing out the 
more 
violent 
and 
oppressive 

moments of American history.

He once said that slavery was 

the illegitimate child of America, 
hidden in a closet, never talked 
about. It was through images like 
these that my idea of America 
solidified.

It was here, in sixth hour, that I 

first became interested in history 
— a passion I maintain today.

At the end of my sophomore 

year Mr. Delap retired, and at the 
end of my junior year I left the 
comforts of Fayetteville, Ark., 
for Ypsilanti, Mich. I traded the 
Natural State for the Pure State.

In Arkansas, my last name 

granted me firsthand judgement 
and 
second-class 
citizenship. 

It wasn’t that Arkansas, or 
Fayetteville, lacked diversity, but 
in the halls of my high school I 
wasn’t eager to tell anyone that 
I spoke Spanish. As I look back, 
it almost felt like the Latinx 
students were there to fill in 
the seats, and leave — quietly. I 
never felt overt racism but there 
was almost a passive aggressive 
attitude. You didn’t always see 
people of color in AP classes — 
there was an implicit division.

In 
Ypsilanti, 
I 
became 
a 

different 
kind 
of 
minority. 

This was a school where my 
skin color, my heritage and my 
name were no longer the parts 
of my identity that stood out. It 
was saying things like, “Oh my 
parents are professors” that did. 
I became much more aware of 
my own privilege. Ypsilanti is a 
low-income working class town 
that has had a struggling school 
system for years.

It wasn’t until I sat down in 

Ypsilanti High School that I 
witnessed the realities of Mr. 
Delap’s lectures. He said that 
America was born shackled to 
racism. Here, I realized that not 
only had America never freed 
herself of those shackles, but she 
had built an empire on the backs 
of those she deemed less worthy. 
At this school, teachers were “let 
go” in February, textbooks were 
older than me and locked up, 
the library wasn’t open 
and school lunches were 
served frozen. I faced an 
education 
system 
that 

stripped students of their 
educational 
rights. 
It 

wasn’t a school, but rather 
an 
incubator 
prepping 

America’s next generation 
of laborers.

I graduated and did 

so with an unimagined 
support from my teachers. 
It was the teachers who, 
despite the system, tried 
to keep an idealization 
of education alive. It was 
a support I was never 
afforded in Fayetteville. 
With this in mind, I 
decided to email the few 
people, teachers, who had 
made a difference in my 
academic career.

I emailed Mr. Delap 

and I told him I had 
been 
accepted 
to 
the 

University of Michigan. I 
told him how his class had made 
me aware of realities I would 
have otherwise missed. I said I 
wanted to study history. But most 
importantly, I thanked him for 
teaching honestly.

Since then we have held 

correspondence for two years. In 
those years we have discussed, 
even debated, several aspects of 
American history. It was while 
I was studying in France earlier 
this year that I got his latest email. 
The tone of this email felt almost 
defeated — a tone I had never 
associated with Mr. Delap, who, 
despite talking about American 

history without stripping it of its 
violent and oppressive nature, 
never sounded like he had lost 
hope. The developments of the 
last two years had gotten to him. 
He couldn’t reconcile the America 
he had taught with the America 
that was developing before his 
very eyes.

I remember rereading the 

email and not being able to come 
up with an articulate reply. I 
decided to call him.

For the first time we didn’t 

discuss history, or at least not 
directly. Instead, he told me 
about his life — how he became a 
teacher and why.

Mr. Delap was a teenager during 

the Civil Rights Movement, he 
began his teaching career during 
the Vietnam War, and is now as 
retired as Trump is overhauling 
American politics.

“Back in those days, in the ‘60s, 

I lived in Kansas City. You can’t 
really say that it was segregated, 
in restaurants people ate together, 
but housing was segregated. The 
only “mixing” was in sports,” he 

paused.

He discussed his childhood 

memories, highlighting that there 
were injustices, similar to those 
that I had witnessed my senior 
year.

“I would come home from 

school and turn on the news 
and watch footage to see what 
was going in Selma, dogs and 
police with fire hoses,” he said. 
He continued by saying that 
even after all of these years the 

prejudice persists — he 
says that people never got 
over their racist roots.

In the natural pause of 

the conversation he broke 
the silence saying, “Maybe 
we have to wait for enough 
of us to die off.” He sighed 
and followed this comment 
by saying that that really 
wouldn’t change anything 
because racism has taken 
hold of a new generation — 
our generation.

He went on to tell me 

about how he almost got 
drafted, but that it was 
a time where they were 
bringing 
soldiers 
back 

so that he was promptly 
rejected.

I 
asked 
him 
if 
he 

thought he would have 
gone and he replied, “I 
always 
understood 
the 

anti-war movement, and 
sympathized with the anti-
war movement” but, “I was 

a straight and narrow guy so that 
if the government asks I would 
go.”

This is quickly followed by, 

“Seventeen of my high school 
classmates were killed — what 
makes me sick is not one of them 
was what I would call a patriot.”

He said in his town most of the 

students went into the military. 
They followed the path of their 
parents. They went in to find a 
skill and then a job.

“No one wanted to triumph 

over 
communism, 
they 
just 

followed tradition — learning a 
skill in the army, it was the normal 

thing to do,” he said.

I asked him if after all of these 

years he felt discouraged to see 
the state of America, having 
spent most of his life teaching its 
history.

He sighed and almost laughed.
“I’ve said this many times, I 

don’t know if it is true — but I say 
it a lot so maybe there is a grain of 
truth — maybe I would be better 
off selling life insurance, teaching 
was a calling, religious people talk 
about calling, and teaching was 
my calling, but my career was, 
I don’t know, maybe I deluded 
myself.” 

I interjected, “That teaching 

was your calling?”

“It 
might 
have 
been 
but 

the last few years I didn’t feel 
satisfied, and I think that is my 
fault — maybe I just wanted too 
much, I wanted everyone to be 
as interested in what we were 
supposed to be studying, and as 
the years went on they were less 
and less interested.”

He continued by saying that the 

last year was the most frustrating. 
He felt more pressured to make 
sure students passed so they 
could graduate. He felt as though 
he was no longer there to educate 
people, but to train them.

Through the many lectures on 

American History, Mr. Delap’s 
voice over the phone and my own 
experiences, I began to see the 
figure of the American student 
morphe.

It was only by leaving Arkansas 

that I began to witness my own 
privilege, but most importantly 
I got to see a broken system. In 
some ways, we are witnessing 
the tragedy of the American 
education play out before our very 
eyes. It is the color of our skin 
or our class that determines the 
education we receive. This divide 
shows education as a funnel, a 
function of the state to answer 
the demands of a country and 
a market. Once it was soldiers, 
today it is the poor and minority 
working class. This is the tragedy 
of a miseducation.

ILLUSTRATION BY TATIANA LOPATIN


I became a notetaker with Services 

for Students with Disabilities entirely 
by accident. One April evening during 
my freshman year, I was having dinner 
with my best friend and her friend. Her 
friend happened to mention that he was 
a notetaker, and he gave me the email 
address of someone I could contact about 
getting involved. I was looking for a second 
job, and I knew I was good at taking notes. 
I also liked the idea of sitting in on classes 
I would not have otherwise been able to 
take. I emailed Jill Rice, coordinator of 
Services for Students who are Deaf and 
Hard of Hearing, and she added my name 
to the list of notetakers.

I then went home for the summer and 

forgot about the whole thing.

Last fall, I was quickly initiated into 

a world I didn’t know existed. SSD 
coordinates a variety of accommodations 
and programs for students with disabilities 
ranging from from mobility impairments 
to learning disabilities to hearing loss. I 
became part of the notetaking division, a 
small army of students who attend classes 
and take notes for students registered with 
SSD. Some classes are straightforward, 
requiring notes to be taken on a computer 
and emailed to the student. Other times, 
an assignment may come with special 
instructions — take notes with a special 
black marker provided by SSD, for example.

Notetaking can be a strange job, because 

I often take notes for upper-level classes in 
unfamilar subjects. In fact, the first class 
I ever took notes for was an upper-level 
Economics course, and I knew absolutely 
nothing about the material. As I took notes 
and as the semester progressed, I began to 
relax into the fluid mindlessness of writing 
words that I had no need to understand. 
Over time, the initial peculiarity of the job 
transformed into something soothing and 

even meditative.

Despite working for 

the SSD for two years, 
and becoming an expert 
on the mystery that is 
notetaking, I remained 
incognizant 
of 
the 

many stories shaping 
disability on campus. 
Being 
a 
notetaker 

has made me aware 
of a set of challenges 
that 
my 
privilege 

as 
an 
able-bodied 

student had previously 
allowed me to ignore 
— though I recognize 
that even with this 
understanding, I have 
barely scratched the 
surface. The specifics 
of 
the 
challenges 

remained abstract. I 

imagine that for many 

able-bodied students, the experiences 
of students with disabilities is similarly 
obscure.

Ignoring the needs of disabled students 

at the University of Michigan means 
overlooking a very significant minority. 
During the 2016-2017 school year, 6.3 
percent of the 46,000 students at the 
University registered with SSD. Of course, 
the experiences of these students are as 
diverse, if not more, than the experiences 
of able-bodied students at the University, 
and it would be a mistake to lump them all 
together.

Last week I spoke to LSA senior DeAnna 

Jerore. Jerore is studying Political Science 
with a minor in Sustainability. For her first 
three years at the University, she was an 
able-bodied student. On Aug. 24, Jerore 
suffered a fall that severed her spinal 
cord. The accident left her unable to walk 
without the use of a four-wheeled walker.

The severity and permanence of Jerore’s 

injury means that she has been forced 
to quickly adapt to life with a mobility 
impairment. Adjusting physically and 
emotionally while also communicating 
with her professors has been challenging, 
but it has not stopped her from taking 
classes. 
Jerore 
explained 
that 
the 

availability of SSD resources has been 
instrumental in allowing her to return to 
her studies just weeks after the accident, 
despite doctors encouraging her to put 
school on hold.

Jerore 
explained 
that 
becoming 

registered with SSD required a variety of 
paperwork and in-person meetings, which 
posed some difficulty since she spent 
three weeks in the hospital following her 
operation. However, she explained that 
overall she has a had a positive experience 
with the SSD.

This semester, Jerore commutes to 

campus periodically. SSD coordinates with 
Information and Technology Services 
to provide Jerore with audio-visual 
recordings of her classes, allowing her to 
keep up from home until she is ready to 
return to campus full-time.

After graduation, Jerore plans to pursue 

a master’s degree in Urban Planning. 
She’s interested in how climate change is 
beginning to impact everyday life, and she 
hopes to design sustainable spaces that 
foster cohesion and community among 
people of all identities and cultures.

“This 
experience 
has 
changed 

my direction in terms of what those 
community places look like, and how they 
operate to encompass everyone, where it 
doesn’t feel like someone is being othered,” 
Jerore explained.

Though Jerore has found the SSD to 

be helpful, she noted that she has faced 
challenges with faculty.

Jerore has noticed that her professors 

and graduate student instructors don’t 
seem to understand the severity of her 
injury. “The biggest challenge for me is 
that coming back and sending out emails, 
professors and GSIs were like, ‘Oh, hope 
you get better soon!’” Jerore said.

Jerore 
said 
she 
understands 
that 

these emails came from a place of 
misunderstanding, not malice. Before 
her accident, she didn’t know much about 
spinal cord injuries either.

“I didn’t say this, but it sort of burned 

me up a little bit,” she explained. “I think 
that some of the awareness needs to be 
there. Because that was very, very difficult 
— I was even sending multiple emails 
and having doctor’s letters and whatnot 
in terms of trying to give (professors and 
GSIs) a sense of how serious this was. That 
took up a lot of my time.”

A lack of awareness among faculty 

about disability is a symptom of the 
University’s insufficient efforts to make 
campus 
accessible. 
While 
Jerore’s 

experience with SSD has been largely 
positive, the campus remains largely 
inaccessible — both literally, for students 
with mobility impairments, and also in 
regards to attitudes toward disabilities. 
The University’s 2015 Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion strategic plan is notably silent on 
disability.

Some disabled students have also 

questioned 
SSD’s 
requirement 
that 

students register to receive services, 
pointing out that students with other 
marginalized identities are not required to 
“prove” their identity.

While the University ranks high on lists 

of disability-friendly schools, this may 
say more about the state of accessibility 
in higher education than it does about the 
University’s accommodations for disabled 
students. While SSD has many programs 
that benefit registered students, the office 

does not have the power to alter class 
requirements for students. University 
professors are provided with a handbook 
on how to best accommodate disabled 
students, but SSD cannot compel faculty 
to make any changes to their curriculum, 
even for students with SSD documentation.

While the staff of SSD works hard to 

provide accommodations, it is important to 
note their budget appears somewhat limited.

SSD is funded by both a general fund and 

an Americans with Disabilities Act Provost 
Fund. According to a 2014 presentation, 
the general fund budget has been cut by 
1.5 percent every year since 2007. The 
2014 general fund allocation was $18,000, 
down from $32,000 in 2007. The ADA 
Provost Fund provides between $300,000 
and $700,000 per year to ensure ADA 
compliance. SSD also receives money from 
individual donors.

Given that SSD provides resources to 

6.3 percent of students, their operating 
budget is quite small compared to other 
organizations that serve an equal or 
lesser number of students. There are 1,011 
student-athletes, for example, meaning 
that student-athletes make up a little over 2 
percent of the general student population. 
For the 2018-2019 fiscal year, Michigan 
Athletics has projected a $2.5 million 
budget surplus; its total budget for the year 
was $188.1 million.

This is not, of course, a perfect 

comparison. Michigan Athletics creates 
revenue, while SSD does not. Sports 
also holds a cultural, communal and 
aesthetic value that disability resources 
and awareness lack. Still, the difference 
between the SSD and Michigan Athletics 
operating budgets are striking.

As an able-bodied notetaker, I rarely 

considered the people receiving my notes. 
Before learning more about SSD, notetaking 
was a simply a job for me. After researching 
the University’s accessibility, many of my 
preconceptions about what it means to be 
disabled on campus have been challenged.

The ways campus and classes are 

designed for able-bodied students are 
glaringly apparent. How would a student 
with a mobility impairment navigate the 
stacks in Hatcher Graduate Library, for 
instance? How would a blind student have 
their obscure class readings translated 
to Braille? How would a student with a 
learning disability convince an unwilling 
professor to provide extra time on an exam?

I’m humbled to have spoken to Jerore, 

and 
hearing 
about 
her 
experiences 

has radically changed my perspective. 
Obviously, the stories of SSD and the 
experiences of disabled students at the 
University are sometimes contradictory. 
Hearing these stories and recognizing 
their rich complexity is perhaps the first 
step toward a more accessible and equitable 
campus.

T

he recording starts with Bach’s 
“Toccata and Fugue in D Minor” 
on the organ — you’d know it if 

you heard it — with a minor modulation 
of pitch, a quiver. Then a voice rings out 

above the organ’s echo.

“Good evening.”

*organ intro repeats*
“This is Dan Burke of Can-

terbury House”

*organ once again*
“… bringing you some of the 

sounds of the good news.”

*large applause*
Some of them are weird 

sounds, some of them are 
sweet sounds and some of 
them are perplexing sounds.

Burke’s deep, rich voice is 

immediately cut off by the 
first verse of Carl Ander-
son’s “Superstar” from the 
“Jesus Christ Superstar” 

soundtrack. If this record-
ing of Reverend Burke’s radio 

show from 1971 doesn’t convey 
Canterbury House’s blend of 
musical innovation and spiri-

tuality, I don’t really know 

what could.

Burke’s radio show, 

along with a litany of 
purely magical musical 
performances recorded 
right 
at 
Canterbury 

House’s late 1960s cof-
fee shop location at 
330 Maynard in Ann 
Arbor, were recent-
ly unearthed by the 

Michigan History Project. 
The seven-inch reel-to-reel 
tapes were previously owned 
by an independent collector, 

then they were lost for a few years, until 
MHP found them in the hands of a musi-
cian and immediately got to work con-
verting them to a digital format and then 
preserving the original tapes.

MHP is constantly on the lookout for 

more tapes in a quest to preserve the 
cultural memory of Canterbury House 
before all the original recordings from 
the era are lost, according to the presi-
dent Alan Glenn. MHP is currently in 
talks with a record company and is hop-
ing to issue the tapes as part of a deluxe 
vinyl release series. Sadly, some of these 
new recordings might not see the light of 
day due to copyright restraints. 

“We’re (trying to release the material) 

mainly to further our mission of preserv-
ing and publishing the history of Michi-
gan — and also because it’s so incredibly 
cool!,” Glenn wrote in an email inter-
view. “Seriously though, people’s mis-
taken expectations that their old tapes, 
films, photos and the like are worth a lot 
of money is a big problem for historical 
preservation … This stuff rots away in a 
musty attic or basement until it turns to 
crumbling, moldy dust. That’s a tragedy, 
because when history is lost, it’s gone for-
ever.”

These tapes are an archivist’s heaven 

— they aren’t cheap bootleg recordings 
made by an audience member, but rather 
professional tapes run directly from the 
venue’s soundboard made with permis-
sion from the artists. More importantly, 
they represent the panoply of music dur-
ing a time of political turmoil, with the 
Vietnam War in full swing. On these 
tapes, artists such as Joni Mitchell, Neil 
Young, Dave Van Ronk, Odetta, Doc Wat-
son, Len Chandler, the Jim Kweskin Jug 
Band, the New Lost City Ramblers, David 
Ackles and Steve Noonan bare their souls 

to crowds of fewer than 200 University of 
Michigan students and Ann Arbor resi-
dents, some just before the world would 
know their names and musical creations.

During my “listen to my Discman on 

the bus” phase in sixth grade (everyone 
had those, right?), I got a Best Buy gift 
card for Christmas. My dad took me and 
convinced me to buy Neil Young’s Great-
est Hits. There it stayed in my yellow Dis-
cman Sport for months on end.

When the Coen Brothers’ film “Inside 

Llewyn Davis” came out, I couldn’t get 
the soundtrack out of my head. That’s 
where I learned about Dave Van Ronk, 
and his songs have stayed in my cover 
repertoire ever since. Once a guy at an 
open mic brought me three Van Ronk LPs 
cause he knew how much I idolized the 
folk singer.

This past summer, Joni Mitchell’s Blue 

got me through some incredibly rough 
times. I’d be lying if I said she doesn’t 
creep into my weekly listening habits this 
semester too.

I’m telling you this because the music 

that came out of these found recordings 
has been with me for years. When I told 
people I was working on this piece, the 
response was eerily similar among almost 
everyone I talked to.

“What’s Canterbury House?” 
The music Canterbury House has pro-

vided a platform, for from the ’60s, to 
today has influenced me as a writer and 
as a person. Canterbury’s story inspires 
me to both respect the art of the past and 
continuously look to the future to consid-
er what space my own art can occupy. I 
hope it does the same for you.
B

ishop Samuel Harris saw the 
need for an Episcopal student 
ministry on the University cam-

pus in 1885. According to documents pro-

It’s a question I’m asked more often 

than I’d like. Yet every time I’m faced 
with it, I draw a blank, regurgitating a 
superficial answer that I’ve perfected 
over time. To this day, I’m still unsure 
of what constitutes a designer, or if 
there is a single label that I can use to 
answer this question more concisely.

Design is an incredibly broad field. 

Wikipedia defines it as “(the) creation 
of a plan or convention for the 
construction of an object, system or 
measurable human interaction.” By 
that definition, everyone who makes 
a contribution to a product is a 
designer. Everything that we interact 
with on a day-to-day basis has been 
designed to some extent. Design is 
typically broken down into different 
disciplines, all of which share the 
common feature of creation for users 
and their environment. Personally, 
the ambiguous yet multidisciplinary 
nature of design work is what I love 
most about being a designer.

I don’t fit into a single mode of 

designer; rather, I wear different 
hats depending on the stakeholders 
involved. Oftentimes, I’m a graphic 
designer, who is tasked with using 
visual elements to communicate 
information 
and 
ideas. 
This 

can significantly affect a user’s 
impression of a product. Colors, fonts 
and iconography come to life and are 
tied into a visual identity. The initial 
pen-and-paper designs transform in 
the digital world of Adobe Creative 
Cloud and materialize through print, 
where the impact of my creations 
becomes quantifiable. Every page of 
The Michigan Daily that I create is an 
empowering reminder of the status 
I hold as a graphic designer, where 
even the slightest design decisions 
can 
shape 
readers’ 
reactions 

entirely.

On other occasions, I’m a user 

experience designer where my job 
is to be attentive to the behavioral 
consequences of a user’s interaction 
with a product. Ultimately, my goal 
is to maximize the satisfaction 

of the user. This is often done 
through 
research 
on 
targeted 

users, identifying main points in a 
product, exercising convergent and 
divergent thinking to find solutions 
and iterating upon prototypes to 
visualize different potential user 
pathways. These solutions should 
be robust and thoroughly tested 
by actual users. Across the entire 
process, visual appeal, cognitive 
implications and emotions of the 
user are essential to keep in mind. 
The design-thinking behind user 
experience is something I try to 
exercise as often as I can in my 
everyday life. In more general terms, 
I am cognizant of how my actions are 
affecting my interactions with others 
and how I can adapt my behavior 
accordingly.

Requirements and roles often 

change when I am working on a 
project. In these scenarios, I’m a 
product designer who oversees all 
aspects of a product from start-to-
finish. This entails working with the 
intermediate aspects of a product 
such as psychological and social 
impacts, 
technical 
limitations 
in 

product functionality, and more. The 
baseline goal of a product designer 
is to create products that cater to 
a user’s needs by solving existing 
problems. Product designers have 
knowledge across disciplines; they’re 
capable of conducting research on 
user data, creating wireframes and 
prototypes for potential solutions, 
and devising strategies on how the 
product will solve a problem -- all of 
which I’ve had the opportunity to do.

With this, I still struggle with 

finding a term that encompasses 
my 
collective 
design 
identities. 

“Designer” is far too open-ended, 
whereas “graphic designer” has 
specific expectations that constrain 
my creativity. However, finding a 
suitable label comes second to 
seeing my impact on the world. 
Design has the ability to shape a 
person’s emotions and experiences 

when 

interacting 
with 
something, 
and 
using 

that 
ability 

in a positive 
light gives me 
an unparalleled 
feeling of joy.

As a mostly self-

taught 
designer, 

a bulk of my design 
expertise 
comes 
from 

absorbing other designers’ ideas 
and concepts into my own, and 
iterating off of those to discover my 
unique design style. Over the years, 
I’ve collected a variety of different 
tips and techniques that have helped 
me explore my design identity, some 
of which are below:

• 
Being vulnerable. Vulnerability 
is closely tied with discomfort, 
which is an agent of change. 
This 
change 
can 
positive 

or 
negative; 
with 
proper 

guidance, 
positive 
change 

can lead to growth. Being in a 
vulnerable situation allows for 
the development of new ideas 
and perspectives.

• 
Making mistakes. And not 
being afraid to make mistakes. 
Every designer starts from the 
bottom, and through mistakes, 
can learn to improve. Missing 
the mark has significantly 
more personal impact than 
perfectly handling a task. 
Lots of discoveries arise from 
experiencing failure.

• 
Not letting fear hold you back. 
If you want to experiment with 

different 
creative 

approaches, go for it! The 
worst thing that could happen 
is failing the task, which is 
a small obstacle in the long 
run of things. Get creative by 
breaking the boundaries of 
design

• 
Be a good listener. Not just 
hearing feedback, but really 
listening 
and 
digesting 

someone’s opinion of your 
work. 
Feedback 
is 
super 

valuable and is essential in 
growth as a designer, so use 
it to your advantage in your 
iterations.

I’ve learned to be content with 

not having a solidified identity as 
a designer. If anything, it provides 
more opportunities for me to grow 
my design skills by applying them 
to different disciplines. The thought 
process that comes with being a 
designer has come in handy in all 
aspects of my life, and I wouldn’t 
have it any other way; I hope to 
continue shaping my future and 
others’ through design.

vided by current Canterbury leadership, 
Harris worried the student body at the 
time would “become too secularized and 
forget their religious foundation,” and 
took it upon himself to see Hobart Hall 
— shortly after renamed Harris Hall — be 
built at 617 East Huron Street. The build-
ing still stands, but is now used as office 
space.

The Hobart Guild, the organization in 

charge of the Hall, aimed to “stimulate 
(the student body’s) spirituality,” hosted 
their first regular meeting on Oct. 2, 1890. 
Harris Hall, a steam-heated building with 
a capacity of 500 people, included a stage 
— a crucial symbol of performance that 
would continue with the Church for years 
to come — a non-smoking billiards room, 
a library, a dining room, a bowling alley 
and more.

The building would fall into disuse as a 

social gathering as the University grew — 
eventually being swallowed up and leased 
by the school — and the ministry moved 
to a smaller house owned by St. Andrew’s 
on Lawrence Street in 1935. Several years 
after the World War II, the Episcopa-
lian Student Foundation took over, hir-
ing a chaplain and moving to 218 North 
Division Street. The institution, after 
changing buildings (and even names) a 
few times, would finally settle at its cur-
rent location of 721 Huron as Canterbury 
House in 1995.

Go back to 1967. What I wouldn’t give 

to be in the room with Burke and Mar-
tin Bell, the Chaplains at the time, when 
they decided to transform the mission of 
Canterbury House, and subsequently Ann 
Arbor’s place in music history.

Burke, following the trend of religious 

institutions nationwide in the late ’60s, 
wanted to blend current fads with spiritu-
ality to connect with a generation bent on 
rebellion. The college students of the late 
’60s wanted nothing to do with an orga-
nized establishment telling them what 
to do, when to do it and what to believe. 
The dream of the coffee house chapel, 
in Burke’s words, was a “means of estab-
lishing contact, whether it be through 

folk music, folk rock, blues, liturgy, art or 
drama.”

Burke and Bell, along with student 

manager Ed Reynolds, a music fanatic 
who, according to Canterbury documents, 
“was completely turned off to all things 
that smacked of religion,” made the move 
to an old print shop at 330 Maynard and 
turned the space into a coffee house/min-
istry/concert venue/everything but the 
kitchen sink in terms of cultural potential.

This move was a catalyst for the flood 

of musical invention that was brimming 
at the University. Students plucking away 
at guitars and banjos in their dorms were 
dying for a place to play and hear their 
musical idols. Burke, Bell and Reynolds 
made this dream possible.
W

hen I first received a batch of 
the recording samples from 
Glenn at MHP, I was sit-

ting in a pristine white coffee shop with 
antique furniture, delicate latte foam 
designs and the sounds of Noname’s new 
album Room 25 pumping through the 
speakers just around the corner from 
330 Maynard. I closed whatever home-
work I should have been working on, as 
well as the Facebook tab I was mindlessly 
scrolling through, and rocketed my hand 
towards my backpack to find my earbuds. 
I found the files and knew which one 
would be my first listen.

“joni_mitchell_marcie_1968.flac”
I hit play on the reel-to-reel sample. 

The voice of an emcee emerges. It is quick 
and businesslike, as if he’s announcing the 
next stop on the subway.

“Joni Mitchell.”
Applause follows. However, after a 

name like Joni Mitchell’s, given her 
legendary status today, you’d expect a 
stadium of cheering fans to be heard. 
Canterbury House is no stadium. It wasn’t 
even the size of the Michigan Theater. 
It was, in this iteration, quite literally a 
coffee shop with a stage, a decent sound 
booth and minimal lighting.

This low-key setup feeds into the 

recordings. The claps reverberated off 
the walls in a way only intimate venues 

can allow. Then, 
everything 
around me melt-
ed as Mitchell 
began to sing.

“Marcie in a 

coat of flowers 
/ 
Stops 
inside 

a candy store / 
Reds are sweet 
and greens are 
sour / Still no let-
ter at her door …”

I’m in a tight 

spot here. As a 
writer, it’s my job 
to find the exact 
words to convey 
Mitchell’s 
vocal 

quality, her fin-
gerpicking on her 
acoustic 
guitar, 

her lyrical prow-

ess as a songwriter, to you, the reader. I’ve 
heard the tapes and you haven’t. This isn’t 
a taunt, but rather a description of the role 
I am in the position to fulfill.

The problem is Mitchell transcends 

description. Her serene, profound sopra-
no register lures you in but, as soon as 
you think you have a moment to breathe 
and revel in the beauty Mitchell has con-
structed around you — her lyricism and 
guitar chops knock you on your ass and 
demand you pay your respects to the 
Queen of California. Attention must be 
paid, and Mitchell will get that attention 
without breaking a sweat.

Bob Franke sure paid attention. And 

she thanked him for it.
F

ranke, a student at the Univer-
sity during the late ’60s, was 
what many would consider a 

staple of Canterbury House during the 
coffee house period. Like many folkies of 
the period, Franke and his buddies were 
inspired by Bob Dylan’s mainstream suc-
cess and the folk renaissance. In true early 
Dylan fashion, Frankie and gang would 
listen to people like Reynolds, a mentor 
to Franke, perform cuts from the Harry 
Smith Anthology of American Folk Music, 
a seminal collection of folk songs from the 
’20s and ’30s that laid the groundwork 
for the folk renaissance of the ’60s. From 
there, the folk fever spread in true folk 
tradition.

“He and his friends would take songs 

from the (Harry Smith Anthology) which 
was, basically, the weirdest thing we had 
ever heard but the most wonderful too and 
he’d play all of these stories that we knew 
nothing about,” Franke said. “He learned 
the styles how how to tell these stories 
with a guitar and basically taught those 
techniques to me and we passed them 
back and forth among all our friends.”

Growing 
up, 
Franke 
was 
always 

attracted to music that told stories, spe-
cifically his parents’ musical theater LPs. 
Then, being in a city like Ann Arbor in the 
middle of a folk revival, he couldn’t keep 
away. Franke recounted the moment dur-
ing his freshman year he really solidified 
his relationship with and lifelong rever-
ence of Canterbury House as a space for 
musicians to share their passions and sto-
ries with the audience. When he asked to 
play a set, he was instead given a position 
revered by few but a blessing in disguise — 
the job of doorkeeper.

“It was an education itself. I took money 

at the door and got to see some of the most 
amazing people coming through, folk 
revival people and traditional folk people 
as well and, later on, people who sort of 
stood at the crossroads of folk and pop 
music,” Franke said. “I wound up spend-
ing all my time there and really learned an 
awful lot about music.”

But back to Joni. While working as 

doorkeeper and sometimes playing his 
own songs, Franke saw Mitchell perform 
at Canterbury House in ’67. According 
to a letter from Mitchell’s agent Elliot 
Smith to Reverend Burke, “Joni loved 
playing the Room and when another date 

can be worked out, would love to go back 
once again.” Lucky for Franke, and frankly 
everyone else at the University, Smith and 
Burke arranged for Mitchell to play three 
nights at Canterbury March 8-10, 1968, for 
$650. Franke wasn’t going to let Mitchell’s 
talent slip through Ann Arbor’s fingers 
again without getting the word out some-
how.

Along with his trusted position at the 

door, Franke was also occasionally writ-
ing for The Michigan Daily’s Arts section. 
He had written a review of Mitchell’s first 
Ann Arbor show in ’67 and, in The Daily’s 
March 9 issue, penned the article “Joni 
Mitchell Yang, Dylan Yin,” which began 
with a simple command: “Joni Mitchell is 
playing at Canterbury House this weekend. 
See her.”

Franke described Mitchell’s music best, 

in my opinion, when he wrote, “Perhaps 
one of the best words to describe it is joy. 
Not happiness as such, but the positive 
unity of human experience.” With this 
glowing review in print, Franke wasn’t 
going to miss the show for anything.

“Apparently, (Joni’s) manager had shown 

her the article and she was delighted by it 
because every artist wants to be heard, and 
I had heard her deeply and reported on 
that experience so she asked to meet me,” 
Franke said. “I was still taking money at 
the door and I just went right down, met 
her and she gave me a big hug, thanked me 
for writing the article and I’ve remembered 
that hug for the rest of my life.”

In our conversation, Franke made it 

clear how large of an impact his time at 
Canterbury had on his career as a musician. 
Canterbury House was a place for Franke 
to improve his chops and be exposed to all 
styles of music, learning from other per-
formers and having fun all the while. Out of 
all the things he has kept from the period, 
Franke mentioned he held onto his articles 
on Mitchell.

“What (the articles) meant to me was 

that I was proud that I had gotten it right, 
that I had found something of real value 
and reported on it, shared it with every-
body and that that had an effect to help 
Joni herself become the person and artist 
that she’d become,” Franke said.
W

hile sitting in Espresso Royale 
(South University location) 
looking through a Kodak box 

of film prints and contact sheets, the smil-
ing face of a young boy with a guitar piqued 
my curiosity. Al Blixt, the photographer, 
told me to turn the contact sheet over to see 
if he had written who the performer was. 

Sure enough, it was Franke.

Blixt, also a student at the University at 

the time, photographed countless concerts 
and performances at the coffee shop loca-
tion. Dozens of his prints are in the Bentley 
Historical Archives for Canterbury House. 
In the Espresso Royale lobby, I was holding 
photographic history.

Blixt got his start photographing racing 

tracks with his father growing up. Once he 
got to the University and found out about 
Canterbury House’s Division Street loca-
tion, he fell under its spell, like everyone 
eventually did, and became the official 
Canterbury House photographer.

“I saw something in The Daily or the 

paper so I went and I was hooked,” Blixt 
said during our conversation. “I loved 
it and, of course, at the time in my dorm, 
everyone seemed to have a guitar and they 
were all listening to the Great Folk Scare of 
the 1960s.”

Although he said he loved photograph-

ing the folk musicians, Blixt made a point of 
noting it wasn’t just folkies with an acous-
tic guitar in one hand and Harry Smith’s 
Anthology in the other on stage at 330 
Maynard. His photographs of the Buddy 
Guy Band, with two saxophone players and 
Buddy on electric, back up his argument. 
He points to the metamorphosis in Bob 
Dylan’s sound from the early ’60s to ’67, 
incredibly explored in D. A. Pennebaker’s 
1967 documentary “Don’t Look Back,” to 
highlight the diversity of sounds echoing 
down the alley.

“By this time, Bob Dylan had gone elec-

tric so after that, the crossover between 
electrified music and folk music was 
breached,” Blixt said. “We would have peo-
ple who would come in and sing traditional 
Scottish ballads, mostly it was singer-song-
writers, but … a jug band is not folk music. A 
blues band is not folk music. As a matter of 
fact, if you’re not a string band, you’re not 
folk music.”

Blixt also remembered the events that 

weren’t necessarily performances, such as 
noon movie screenings and free brown rice 
and apple cider. Blixt said the people there 
knew the space was special.

As the official photographer, Blixt’s 

photos were mounted on the walls of the 
the coffee house for patrons to see. In his 
photos lies both a journalistic eye for cap-
turing the event and a sense of drama and 
storytelling. We talked extensively about 
one photo of Doc Watson, a singer-song-
writer who had been blind since he was a 
year old but revolutionized folk music with 
his flatpicking style. In his print, Watson is 

waiting in the green 
room 
of 
Canter-

bury House before 
a performance, and 
Blixt and I couldn’t 
help but comment 
on his concentra-
tion and what could 
possibly be running 
through his head — 
lyrics, stories to tell 
onstage or anything 
under the sun.

“Anytime 
you’re 

photographing 
musical 
artists, 

there’s no sound so 
what you’re trying 
to do is capture a 
representation that 
encapsulates 
the 

experience the best 
you can,” Blixt said. 
“What you’re trying 
to do is to (capture) 
something 
where 

people 
would 
say 

‘That’s a cool pic-
ture and I don’t even 
know who it is.’”
G

ayle 
Rubin, an 
associate 

professor of Anthro-
pology and Women’s 
Studies, started DJing 
in junior high school before becoming a 
Wolverine. She discovered her passion for 
music when she noticed the reaction from 
people at parties when she’d take a turn 
selecting albums for the record player.

“People would be sitting around, feeling 

awkward and I would just go over to the 
record player and start putting stuff on and 
they would start to dance,” Rubin said.

Rubin started her college career in ’66 

and discovered Canterbury at the Maynard 
location in ’67. Like Blixt and Franke, she 
remembered having the opportunity to see 
tons of incredible talents, some that made it 
big and others that potentially should have. 
She got to see Neil Young, Mitchell, Jim 
Kweskin and many more artists in their 
prime.

However, like Blixt, she also looked back 

fondly on other elements of the magical 
space for members of the artist community 
at the University, such as the spirituality 
in the space and the conversations around 
food sustainability.

“It was wonderful in so many ways,” 

Rubin said. “It was a religious organization 
first and foremost … but a lot of the minis-
ters were very progressive so it became a 
place where people who were part of ‘the 
Movement’ gathered and went for meet-
ings, to hang out, to go to services on Sun-
day. I am not religious, and I didn’t grow 
up Christian but even I went to services. 
They were just really profoundly pleasant 
and inspiring services to go to. Also, one of 
Ann Arbor’s first health food restaurants 
was located as a little kind of salad bar in 
the front of Canterbury House.”

Although Rubin currently still DJs 

from time to time, she finds the differ-
ences between recorded and live music to 
be crucial to an audiophile. As you can tell 
from recordings such as Neil Young’s Sugar 
Mountain - Live at Canterbury House 1968, 
shows at Canterbury were nothing like the 
recorded material from the same artist. 
They told stories, they had extended asides, 
or “raps” as the Young reissue calls them, 
and they could converse with the intimate 
crowds. Rubin said this is where the beauty 
of live music rings true.

“Recorded music always sounds the 

same, because once it’s recorded, it’s like 
publishing a book. It’s codified. It’s there 
on a page,” Rubin said. “Live music is more 
spontaneous. It can vary quite a bit more … 
 

And the way sound works live is very dif-
ferent than the way it works coming off of a 
stereo or coming out of speakers … You can 
feel the air move and you certainly could at 
Canterbury House.”

With folks like Young and Mitchell sell-

ing out amphitheaters today, these gigs 
have a superstar aura to them — huge 
amplification systems, big spotlights and 
thousands of adoring fans. However, Fran-
ke, Blixt and Rubin were lucky enough to 
catch them and many more at the intimate 
sets of Canterbury, with the air moving 
around them.

However, the music wasn’t the only 

thing making the air move in the late ’60s. 
If you wanted to rebel against the Man and 
the War Machine, you’d just have to head 
down the very same alley at 330 Maynard.

Part two of this series will run in next 

Wednesday’s issue of Statement Magazine. 

“The claps reverberated off the walls 

in a way only intimate venues can 
allow. Then, everything around me 
melted as Mitchell began to sing.”

Of course football players, coaches, and 
cheerleaders are prominent figures at foot-
ball games, but so many people make foot-
ball Saturdays as exciting and enjoyable 
as they are. As alumni came back for the 
homecoming game this weekend, I tried to 
capture some of the spirit of the game and 
Michigan community.
