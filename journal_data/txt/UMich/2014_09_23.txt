Faculty outline
recommendations to
better campus climate
in report to provost
By ALLANA AKHTAR
DailyStaff Reporter
After the University's Black
Student Union called on the Uni-
versity last year to take steps
toward building a more inclusive
campus, the Office of the Provost
is starting the school year with
a new set of recommendations
to foster diversity and improve
campus climate.
The Office of the Provost
released reports Sept. 16 from
three faculty-led committees,
including the Committee on
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.
The report contained 13 recom-
mendations designed to build a
more diverse student body and
faculty, create a welcoming cam-
pus climate for minority students
and establish programs to help
members of the University com-
munity recognize and address

instances of discrimination.
The committee consists of
11 faculty members from eight
schools and colleges, plus one
graduate student, one under-
graduate student and two staff
members. The committee was
convened by University Pro-
vost Martha Pollack in Decem-
ber 2013, shortly after the BSU
launched their #BBUM Twitter
campaign. The committee met
on weekly basis through last May
to gather data and compose a
plan to address issues related to
diversity.
In an announcement in Janu-
ary, Pollack pledged to address
several of the BSU's demands,
including the allocation of funds
for a renovation of the Trotter
Multicultural Center.
The committee's new recom-
mendations include creating a
strategic plan for diversity, form-
ing a committee to study the
experiences of faculty members
of color and forming partner-
ships with school districts to
improve the pipeline of minor-
ity students to the University's
freshman class.

President calls for
administrative
transparency
By EMILIE PLESSET
Daily StaffReporter
As he continues to adjust to
his new role, University Presi-
dent Mark Schlissel turned to

the faculty and staff in a ques-
tion and answer session as he
addressed the University Sen-
ate Assembly on Monday.
Before opening the floor for
questions, Schlissel expressed
his desire for cohesive and
transparent leadership among
staff and faculty.
After the brief gun scare in
the Chemistry Building earlier
this month when a student in

the NROTC was seen carrying
a benign gun-shaped training
device, many faculty and staff
expressed concerns about gun
safety on campus.
Schlissel said while a simi-
lar situation will probably not
happen again, there is always
a concern that as a large public
center, the University could be
a target for outside violence.
In response to the incident,

University administrators will
take part in an exercise to dis-
cuss the chain of command and
response procedures during
various gun violence scenarios.
In a report by The Michigan
Daily, several faculty members
voiced concern about wheth-
er they would be capable to
respond to this situation appro-
priately.

By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
DailyNewsEditor
Students and faculty in the
aerospace engineering depart-
ment are mourning the loss of a
teacher and colleague after Prof.
Pierre T. Kabamba lost his battle
with lung cancer Saturday, Sept.
20. He was 59 years old.
Kabamba came to the Univer-
sity in 1983 after receiving his
undergraduate degree in Belgium
and his doctorate from Columbia
University. In the winter of 2013,
Kabamba visited the doctor for
what he thought was pneumo-
nia, only to discover he had stage
4 lung cancer, which forced him
to stop teaching. His health was
reportedly improving and Kabam-
ba was scheduled to teach two
classes this term, before decid-
ing in late August that his health
wouldn't allowit,
Kabamba taught Introduction
to Aerospace Engineering and an
advanced design course involving
space and aircrafts. Additionally,
he did research in controls design
and scheduling operations, and
addressed problems associated
with spacecraft.
Prof.Dan Inman, the Aerospace
Engineering department chair,
said he worked with Kabamba at
the beginning of his career and
even offered him his first job at

New initiative aims
to help students
maintain mental
wellness
By TANAZ AHMED
Daily StaffReporter
An array of student lead-
ers gathered in the Michigan
Union Monday for the launch
of the Wolverine Support Net-
work, a University-wide peer
support program designed to
improve mental health.
The initiative aims to help
students work through their
issues with WSN student lead-
ers in weekly meetings, which
are set to begin in January. In
addition to weekly meetings,
the network will also host

events on Fridays that will
focus on community building
and mental health education.
The support network was
one of the main initiatives that
CSG President BobbyDishell, a
Public Policy senior, based his
platform on during last year's
student government elections.
"The number one place stu-
dents turn to for a personal
issue is their friends," Dishell
said during the launch. "How-
ever, there is currently not a
space where this is encouraged
or facilitated. That's why we
came together to really create
this... Our mission statement
is that we empower University
of Michigan students to create
a community to support each
other's mental health."
CSG worked with the Uni-
versity's Counseling and Psy-
chological Services to create

the program. CAPS will train
WSN student leaders through
a three-day retreat as well
as consultations with CAPS
staff throughout the semes-
ter. Applications for students
interested in becoming WSN
leaders will be available Oct.
22.
"I think it holds a promise
of a wonderful idea to help
complement all the other
things on- campus around
mental health," CAPS Direc-
tor Todd Sevig said. "Some of
that is CAPS, some of that is
our Department of Psychiatry,
some of that is the Depres-
sion Center... I really want to
promote the idea of peer edu-
cation, peer support, friends
helping friends and I think
Wolverine Support Network
holds the promise of that."

Studying tribal communities

SIGHT SPEECH H

Sandra Momper, associate
professor ofsocial work,specializes
in research on gambling, substance
abuse and mental health in the
American Indian community.
Momper's research from the past
few years centers on OxyContin
abuse and its effects on the tribal
community, healthcare access, and
the association of gambling with
substance abuse, depression and
criminal history.
What inspired you to pursue
your field of study?
My mother's side grew up on
Bad River Indian Reservation in
Wisconsin, and I grew up there as
a young child, so that's what led

me to this area of interest.
Describe an interesting or
memorable experience
from your research.
During my dissertation study,
there was a study on gambling
and families, and it was a mixed-
method study, so I used qualita-
tive and quantitative data. With
the quantitative data, there was
an interview with 20 women
from the Indian reservation.
Many of them stated that finally,
there were researchers whoasked
them for their opinion, and that
was one of my most memorable
moments, recognizingthat it was
about time that people started

asking Indian people what their
opinion is in terms of what sort of
services they might need.
What project are
you proudest of?
I think the suicide prevention
project because one of the . out-
comes of that project is that the
American Indian community is
more aware of the high suicide
rates, but they're also not feeling
like it's such a stigma to talk about
mental health and suicide. As a
result of the screenings and the
training that we've done, they're
much more apt to discuss and
even say the word suicide.

Backed by the U.S. airstrikes,
Iraqi and Kurdish security forces
have retaken the strategic Mosul
Dam and several small towns.
However, serious challenges
remain since many Islamic State
fighters are operating from cities
with large civilian populations,
such as Fallujah and Mosul.
In northern Iraq, meanwhile,
the U.S. and its allies began
training Kurdish peshmerga
forces to enhance their ability to
fight the Sunni extremists.
Helgurd Hikmet, general
director of the ministry over-
seeing the Kurdish forces, said
that France, Italy and Germany
were among countries provid-
ing training in the use of the new
machine guns, mortars, rockets
and demining robots the Kurd-
ish fighters have received.
The U.S. forces are part of
the advise-and-assist teams that
have been in Irbil, the provincial
capital of the semi-autonomous
Iraqi Kurdish region, for several
weeks. The U.S. has also provid-
ed equipment against roadside
bombs and other sophisticated
artillery to the Kurdish fighters.
Last week, the French joined
in the aerial campaign, and a
number of European countries
have committed to arming the
Kurds and providing humani-
tarian support for more than a
million people displaced by the
onslaught of the Islamic State
group.

Zemke was appointed to the

Right to work: He is against
the right to work legislation
that passed in 2012, which out-
lawed the requirement of union

required it.
"That is essentially creating
an uneven playing field," Zemke
said. "You are telling people that
it is okay for them not to pay for

but yet that organization still has
to provide the services to you.
That is baffling."
Women's rights: He is pro-

"Allowing pay discrimination
in Michigan is going against tal-
ent attraction and retention,"
Zemke said. "By not support-
ing those policies, basically they
are deterring folks from coming

me at all.
In May 2013, Zemke sup-
ported a package of bills that
would promote women's health.
Included in this package were
bills promoting prevention,
treatment and research of wom-
en's diseases, a requirement that
all health facilities offer emer-
gency contraception to rape
survivors and additional efforts
to improve sexual education in
public schools.

WASHINGTON, D4.
Biden to Hispanics:
Obama will act on
immigration
Vice President Joe Biden told
frustrated Hispanic leaders Mon-
day President Barack Obama is
"absolutely committed to mov-
ing forward" on comprehensive
immigration reforms "and he's
going to do an awful lot."
Biden said Obama was deter-
mined to move ahead "with or
without" Congress and "if they
don't get something done by the
end of this year, the president's
going to do it."
Biden's remarks came as he and
his wife, Jill, hosted a Hispanic
Heritage Month reception Mon-
day at their Naval Observatory
residence.
He honored Hispanic educa-

tion administrators and counsel-
ors, calling them "heroes in the
classroom and community."
ALGIERS, Algeria
Islamist group
kidnaps French
citizen in Algeria
A splinter group from al-Qaida's
North African branch kidnapped
a French citizen and said Mon-
day that it would kill him unless-
France halts it airstrikes against
the Islamic State group in Iraq.
In a video that appeared on
social media, a masked member
of a group calling itself Jund
al-Khilafah, or Soldiers of the
Caliphate, addressed the threat
to French President Francois
Hollande and said the hostage
would be killed unless the air-
strikes were halted within 24
hours.
The group said it was answer-
ing a call by Islamic State spokes-
man Abu Muhammad al-Adnani
to attack Americans and Europe-
ans.
The French Foreign Ministry
confirmed the authenticity of the
video and identified the hostage as
55-year-old Herve Gourdel.

"What we learned from
this particular episode is
that most of what has to work
did," Schlissel said. "We have
to communicate better with
people the nature of security
risks."
Schlissel also addressed the
University's relationship with
the city of Detroit. Schlissel
said while many groups and
organizations on campus have
reached out to Detroit, the Uni-
versity has yet to reach out ina
combined interaction.
"We're doing quite a bit
in Detroit," Schlissel said.
"Like many things here at the
University, there isn't opti-
mal coherence in what we're
doing. Things are happening
all over the place, but not tak-
ing advantage of one another,

not serving a positive, uplifting
PR role. If we added togeth-
er all these educational and
research-focused investments
on Detroit, it would be quite
substantial."
In his first Presidential Advi-
sory Group meeting of donors
and advisors next month,
Schlissel hopes to further dis-
cuss the University's current
outreach to Detroit and how
it can continue to improve its
relationship with the city.
"There are plenty of ways I
can imagine where we do good
scholarship and teaching and
work on some of our diversity
issues, we do some engaged
learning that also serves
Detroit," Schlissel said.
He also voiced his thoughts
on the University's relationship
with its Flint and Dearborn
campuses. He said he hopes to
address the three campuses as
different components of a sin-
gle university.

development.
"It's just the right size pool
that, as a startup, you're not one
of 10,000," Mayer said. "You're
one of 1,000. And youcan actually
connect with resources ... there's
all these elements available. You
get to know everyone. It's just a
more manageable, smaller com-
munity."
The reach of this movement,
Mayer said, goes beyond the Uni-
versity, though its strong ties to
the city are undeniable. He said
35'percent of the groups SPARK
works with are student compa-
nies. The rest are local entrepre-
neurs.
A2B Bikeshare, a company
co-founded by University alums
Ansgar Strother and Keith Por-
ter, is one of those success stories.
An entrepreneurship class at the
University sparked their desire to
create cheaper bike-sharing sys-
tems, CEO Strother said.
Their program was adopted
in Lansing in September 2013,
becoming the first modern bike
share system in the state of Mich-
igan. Now, it's set to roll out in
Fairbanks, Alaska.
While he was still a student,
Strother said the startup worked
with TechArb in the develop-
ment phase; in addition to the
Center for Entrepreneurship.
Since graduating, A2B has also
worked with SPARK as it grows
into what Strother calls a "real
company, not just a University
enterprise."
Another Ann Arbor venture is
TurtleCell, an iPhone case that

comes with retractable head-
phones to prevent tangling. The
company is mass-producing the
case, and it hopes to sell 130,000;
by winter.
The company was founded by
University alumni Paul Schrems
and Nick Turnbull and Michigan
State University alum Jeremy
Lindibauer. As students, they
joined TechArb, and later moved
onto AnnArbor SPARK's incuba-
tor space.
Lindlbauer said SPARK was
vital in providing the financial
help to grow their business in
their growth stage. Through
SPARK's business accelera-
tor grant, TurtleCell received
$50,000. The company used this
money to conduct design test-
ing, undergo product verification,
buy equipment and even make an
e-commerce website.
"We originally thought that
we were going to do it all our-
selves," Schrems said. "We were
engineers. We didn't really know
how to sell hundreds of thou-
sands of products, and the distri-
bution deal really allowed us to
do that."
As companies continue to
grow in Ann Arbor, the excite-
ment is propagating. The Uni-
versity is sending students on
entrepreneurial "treks" to expe-
rience other hubs of innovation
and spread the wealth of ideas.
Through a program called
MEngage, the Center for Entre-
preneurship has sent students to
visit companies in the San Fran-
cisco area, where they tour com-
panies like Yahoo! and Google,
talk to executives and even pitch
business ideas in front of local
entrepreneurs and University
alumni.

This year, the Center has cre-
ated a similar, more localized trip
to Grand Rapids. In addition, it
is in the process of formalizing a
"D Trek," or an organized entre-
preneurship connection event in
Detroit, which will likely happen
in summer 2015.
While the Center for Entre-
preneurship is sending students
to discover the realm of entre-
preneurship outside Ann Arbor,
other outside groups are target-
ing University students in their
search for capable employees.
Another is the story of Tivvi,
a mobile application that serves
as a collaborative media platform
for users to easily share photo and
video content. The app aggre-
gates that content with "tiles"
(i.e. the "foodie tile") and sub-
sequently allows users to scroll
through hundreds of submissions
with the same label.
The startup was co-founded by
two Wayne State University stu-
dents, Ishpinder Sahni and Mar-
tin Hermez.
Hermez, now a junior, said he
was exposed to the University as
a high school student - his sister
went to Michigan.
"I sat in on lots of lectures, I
talked to alot of professors ... and
I just knew that was kind of the
hub for engineers," Hermez said.
Each of the application's four
developers is or was a Univer-
sity student. Alumni include Gur-
minder Randhawa and Jackson
Jessup; current students include
Engineering senior Roy Chou
and Engineering junior Jesus
Morales.
"When I started this project, I
thought, 'Hey, I need motivated
programmers.' The best place to
go was Ann Arbor."


DIVERSITY
From Page 1
The report also calls for the
launch of a public campaign
headed by the provost and Uni-
versity president to affirm the
University's commitment to
diversity; as well as renewed
efforts to publicize University
resources tailored to support-
ing minority students and the
creation of taskforces to evalu-
ate admissions criteria and hir-
ing processes.
In addition, the report con-
sidered several challenges asso-
ciated with previous University
attempts to promote diversity
on campus. The report found
there is no criteria used to
evaluate the success or failure
of existing University diversity
programs. There is also wide-
spread confusion about what
strategies the University can
employ to increase minority
enrollment while still adhering
to Proposal 2, the 2006 initia-
tive that banned the use of race
- among other factors - as a
consideration in public higher
education admissions.

The ban was upheld last
spring by the U.S. Supreme
Court. .
The committee also cited a
lack of coordination between
the University's schools and
colleges, as well as the institu-
tion's decentralized nature, as
key reasons minority students
find it difficult to access sup-
port services or groups.
Psychology Prof. Robert
Sellers, the committee's chair,
said the report outlines sev-
eral ideas to help the Univer-
sity achieve a diverse student
body and an inclusive campus
climate.
Though Sellers noted the
University's previous efforts
to combat discrimination and
ensure diversity, he said the
institution could do more.
"We can be better, and we
need to do better," he said. "I
believe that we will do better."
Sellers said some goals may
have an impact sooner than
others and noted that striving
for a more diverse campus is
still a long-term initiative.
"Issues of inequity don't hap-
pen overnight, and don't get
broken down overnight," he
said.

Karin Arizala, a CAPS staff
psychologist who previously
worked with students on mental
health training at the University
California, Santa Barbara, said
she plans to work with WCN
student leaders during their
training.
"I think that's one of the real-
ly profound parts of this style of
service is that it's driven by stu-
dents and students know stu-
dents best," Arizala said.
Leaders from approximate-
ly 17 student organizations
attended the launch, includ-
ing the South Asian Awareness
Network, LSA Student Govern-
ment, MHacks and TedXUofM.
"This is something that
affects a large student popula-
tion on campus and as a govern-
ing body of one of the largest
student organizations, I hope

to raise awareness about mental
health," LSA SG President Nata-
sha Dabrowski, a LSA senior,
said during the launch event.
LSA junior Hannah Lee, a
communityassistantaatAlice
Lloyd Residence Hall, said
WCN will be beneficial for stu-
dents.
"Students will get a lot out of
it," she said. "They're not going
to want to talk to an adult about
issues that they are facing cur-
rently. It would be less like a
therapy session and more like a
peer-on-peer discussion."
However, some students are
slightly more wary of the pro-
gram.
"I would be skeptical about
sending my residents to a pilot
program over CAPS," said
Rackham student Akshay Kini,
a resident adviser. "I think
members of Res Staff have the
training and the experience to
offer the first level of support
that this network seems to pro-
vide."

interacted with Kabamba after
coming to the University three
years ago. He described Kabam-
ba as a dedicated teacher and
respected scholar.
"He was a very kind and gen-
erous person," Inman said. "His
students were always at the cen-
ter of his attention, and he was a
very graceful human being."
He said one of his fondest
memories of Kabamba was from
when he challenged a student
to an arm wrestling contest and
posted the video on Youtube.
Engineering junior Sam Reed
took Kabamba's Introduction to
Aerospace class during his soph-
omore year, and said Kabamba's
passion for teaching was appar-
ent in his lectures.
"He was always really ener-
getic and excited about what he
was doing and made sure that

we understood how everything
worked," Reed said. "He did a
good job covering the building
blocks of aero (space engineer-
ing) and you could tell he was
really passionate about teach-
ing."
Though he had already set
his sights on an aerospace major,
Reed said Kabamba's class gave
him his first glimpse at what his
life as an aerospace engineer
would look like.
"With just a few equations you
can plot an entire journey of an
aircraft, and I've always thought
that was really cool," he said.
"His class kind of showed me the
first steps of what I want to do
with my life."
Kabamba is survived by his
wife and three children.
There will be a visitation
today at the Nie Funeral Home
at 3767 W. Liberty Road in Ann
Arbor. Friends, colleagues and
students are invited to come and
share their memories of Kabam-
ba, with a sharing starting at 6
p.m.

It's on all of us
The sexual assault epidemic has persisted for far too long
Last week President Barack Obama launched his "It's On
Us" initiative to combat collegiate sexual assault, thus
reminding the general public of the shameful epidemic
flourishing in the dark corners of college campuses across the
country. In recent years, reports of sexual offenses reported at
colleges have risen; and in some schools this rise has been stun-
ning. For example, between 2010 and 2012, the number of alleged
forcible sex offenses has more than doubled at the University of
Michigan's Ann Arbor campus - from 16 to 34.

Committing to a belief in change

A house divided

eeting new roommates
for the first time is
incredibly intimidating.
At the University
of Michigan the
rules specify that
if you're "going in
blind" you don't fill
out a questionnaire.
This was done
to "increase '
diversity" and
make sure that MAURA
people live with LEVINE
others who aren't
like them. This
also means you
may end up with someone totally
opposite from you. In other words,
your anxiety is warranted. In
D.C., however, the Michigan in
Washington program allows us to
either pick roommates or fill out a
questionnaire about living habits
to make sure our roommates have
similar routines as us. This took
a lot of the guesswork out as we
moved in and were relieved to find
that our roommates had similar
living customs and bedtimes. After
all, living with three other people,
one bathroom and a brand new
city carries enough anxiety with it
as it is, so this knowledge added a
cushion and made us feel better.
What we quickly came to realize,
however, was that our room was
extraordinarily diverse.: All four
of us are of different religions and
come from different backgrounds.
Layan is from Lebanon, Brie is from
downtown Detroit, my family is
Russian-Jewish and Katie is Cath-
olic. At first we tenderly danced
around these obvious differences,
finding out everything we had in
common and bonding over similar
shopping habits and our collective
obsession with fro-yo. But after
we became more comfortable, we
started willingly talking about our
differences, opening up a dialogue
about diversity that I have never
been able to have on campus in Ann
Arbor. The truth is, MIW is much
more diverse than the rest of our
Ann Arbor campus, and this pro-
gram truly fulfills the Michigan
promise of diversity. Ironically, we
are off campus and finally having
a positive dialogue about cultural
and race issues. While we may be

uniquely positioned, it is apparent
to us that on-campus students are
more polarized, often hanging out
only withtheir own cultural groups
and therefore stifling a positive cul-
tural exchange like the one we have
in D.C. The difference about MIW
is that we are placed here, all alone,
without our other friends from sim-
ilar religions and backgrounds. We
fend for ourselves here and find that
we have grown together despite our
differences, opening our minds to
new ideas and issues.
On campus I participate in Hillel,
the Jewish student organization
that provides a home away from
home for Jewish students. We have
a place to go for Shabbat each Friday
night, have Jewish extracurricular
activities and community service
groups to participate in and social
events, too. I am appreciative for
this community because there I feel
like people understand me. Most
on-campus cultures/religions/
ethnicities have a similar haven,
a place where they can find others
just like them and feel the comfort
of the community they know.
Granted, there are many other
opportunities on campus that are
diversified, where people of all
races and religions can join, but I
find that often, minorities tend to
stick together.
When the on-campus divestment
debate came up last spring, campus
felt more polarized than ever to me.
From students shouting at each other
atarallytoallegedwritingonpeople's
dorm doors, tensions were high. Pro-
Israel students and pro-Palestinian
students alike came out to a heated
rally, and even some professors
expressed a stake in the debate's
outcome. This polarization scared
me, making me feel uncomfortable
and sad. While I too had opinions, it
was hard to seea campus divided.
I have never had pro-Palestinian
friends. At Michigan and even
before I was in college, the Arab-
Israeli conflict prohibited me from
the possibility of open dialogue
about these issues. But when I met
Layan in D.C., we were already
friends on a different basis. Our
family backgrounds and views on
the debate were secondary to our
growing friendship, and eventually
we started talking about the

elephant in the room: the Arab-
Israeli conflict. We vowed to each
other that we would always be open
to answering questions the other
person had about our respective
religions and viewpoints, and we
wished for a better world for our
children where this debate will be
null and void and replaced with
peace. Hearing her perspective
after becoming good friends with
her changed not only my whole
view on the conflict, but also
the* importance of diversity on
campus. Layan has shared with me
her cultural norms by cooking a
traditional Lebanese breakfast and
letting me watch her pray. I've told
her about the Jewish high holidays
that are coming up and explained
what keeping Kosher is like. We're
learning so much not only about
each other's religions but also about
each other as people.
It is unclear how this kind of
positive dialogue could be fostered
on campus. Here in D.C., Layan and
I have left our respective cultural
groups that foster the homogenous
thoughts and encourage a sense of
group dynamic that make you part
of one side or the other. Here we
are just people, interested in politi-
cal science and living together.
Here we are roommates and fore-
most friends, which is what makes
it possible for us to talk so frankly
about such heavy issues. This puts
us in a unique situation that Michi-
gan strives for but is only achieving
minimally on campus. It is rare to
find friends from -polar opposite
groups like those with opposing
stakes in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
While Michigan can't prohibit
people from finding and supporting
groups of their choice on campus,
something should be done about
the polarization between different
groups that has obviously cropped
up. The first step to recovery is
realizing there is a problem. If
we keep allowing ourselves to
join groups that foster a cohesive
group dynamic and we don't meet
other people on the opposite side,
issues like the Arab-Israeli conflict
will never be solved because
polarization will continue to thrive.

it's our problem too

Our generation has much to care about.
Climate change, rising tuition costs, the
protection of our rights and those of others and
the kind ofeconomywewillfaceupongraduation
are just a few issues that have been handed down
to us by older generations who now face different
- yet equally important - political problems of
their own. Millennials make up 25 percent of
the voting population. And yet, our voices are
strangely absent from the policy-making table.
It's true the Millennial generation is perhaps
the most disillusioned with our government
than any other demographic, but if we want to
create actual change and address the problems
important to us, the solution is not to protest
by abstaining, but rather the opposite - it's as
simple as casting a ballot this November.
Voting is important. It is a privilege to live in a
countrywherecertainrights areheldinalienable;
where each citizen has a legitimate voice in
how things affect them and how their interests
are represented in all levels of government.
Additionally, a nation of voters fosters a nation of
politically informed citizens, which encourages
the democratic process even more.
The problem is that Millennials aren't
even engaging in this process. A national poll
conducted by Harvard's Institute of Politics in
early2024 revealed that only23 percent of adults
aged 18 to 24 plan to vote in the 2014 midterm
elections. That's only just more than 8 percent of
the population - a far cry from the 25 percent-

strong we could be.-According to Trey Grayson,
former director of the Harvard Institute of
Politics, "The Institute's spring poll shows 18
to 29 year olds' trust in public institutions at a
five-year low - and their cynicism toward the
political process has never been higher."
Why are Millennials so cynical? It is a
commonly held belief that those who have the
most say in policy-making are "old, rich, white
people." However, this is not a reflection of a
broken system, but one that is actually working
exactly the way it is supposed to. According to
exit polls conducted by the Roper Center Public
Opinion Archives, the highest percentage of
voters in the 2008 Presidential election were
white (74 percent), aged 45 and over (53 percent)
and listing an income $100,000 and above (26
percent). It's no wonder, then, that decisions
being made in Washington reflect the interests
of this demographic at the expense of others -
most people voting are old, rich, white people.
. The easiest and perhaps most meaningful
way to fight for generational equity - having our
voices equally represented with the other demo-
graphics at the policy-making table - is by exer-
cisingourcivil rights andvoting.This November,
all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives
as well as 36 of the 100 seats in the U.S. Senate
will be contested - and local races are taking
place at alllevels across the country.

lot is being written about
gender inequality. Articles,
tweets and ad campaigns
are cast into
the public light
every day, all cir-
cling the same _
general theme:
Women .in our
society are
being neglected.
Sexism is alive TYLER
and well.
They've SCOTT
certainly had
an impact, but
not necessarily the intended one.
Like everything else, the social
media machine has taken hold of
this most recent wave of feminism
and changed how the issue is
presented to society. And it's made
the message stronger.
Thousands of stories flood the'
internet, and when something
like Buzzfeed's "What Men Are
Really Saying When Catcalling.
Women" pops up on my Facebook
timeline, I usually don't recognize
the creator or author. In the digital
age, it's hard to become the face of a
social movement.
Except when the faces are
familiar.
On Facebook and Twitter, it's
the women I know that have the
impact. When close friends do the
"sharing," it's different. That's
when feminism becomes separate
from the media agenda, and part of
real life. There's no point in hoping
for the Betty Friedan of the 21st
century to gain celebrity when the
faces of feminism today share our
classrooms and our families and

our beds.
It's depressing to hear the story
of a friend who changed her mind
about what she planned to wear on
a night out just so being catcalled
wouldn't be an issue. Yet when a
conversation about the byproducts
of misogynistic culture begins.
and some men immediately get
defensive, it's hard not to empathize
with that either.
After all, I've never catcalled
anyone, and many men can honestly
say the same. For a lot of guys, being
labeled as a member of a club that
harasses and demeans our sisters,
friends and girlfriends is hard to
accept, because truthfully it's not
our fault.
However, "it's not our fault"
doesn't mean it's not our problem.
It's a women's issue exclusively
shaped by men's behavior, and until
we can change that, it reflects poorly
on us all. Anger at being labeled as a
cog within the great evil patriarchy
is justified; however, it should be
directed at those who propagate
inequality, not their casualties.
There are many subtle nuances
with the gender inequality discus-
sion, with a whole lot of opinions
thrown around with the facts. This
often changes the narrative from a
push for common good to a heated
personal debate. But catcalling and
slut-shaming are stupidities prac-
ticed all too often on campus, and
they're problems remarkably easy
to solve. Even if decency isn't a
good enough reason to put an end to
them, plenty of incentive exists for
men outside of altruism.
Catcalling a girl does nobody
any good. Any efforts put forth

in attempts to create a positive
outward image are shattered once
the first wolf-whistle lets loose.
Those Sperrys and Nike crew socks
sure look good with that new floral-
patterned pocket-T and vintage
sports team snapback, but it's all
for naught.
, Not to judge ,anyone} on how
they dress or look, but this ironic
interplay happens everydaybecause
enough men act like idiots for it to
overshadow us all. Seeing it happen
should elicit a groan of frustration
and a facepalm from any guy within
earshot, because not only does it
make all of us look bad, but these
poor guys are literally working
against their own self-interest.
However, none of this is new
information. The difference needs
to become in how men's behavior is
perceived by other men. Raise the
standard. Decorum, whether in a
grad school interview or on the way
home from Rick's, should be upheld.
In a way, a lot of the pressures
facing women today don't have
anything to do with women at all.
At the core of the problem, these are
men's issues to address.
Basically, don't be "that guy."
Don't be the guy to allow himself
to be stereotyped in the same way
that he stereotypes and objectifies
others. Don't be that guy who turns
a good thing bad, and embarrasses
everyone around him. Don't be
that guy who acts differently on
a Saturday night than he does
anywhere else, and don't let a friend
be that guy either.

Michigan finishes 7th of8

Recruiting Rundown:
Positive performances

After slow start,
Wolverines top
Iowa on final day to
avoid last place
By ZACH SHAW
Daily Sports Writer
After weathering literal
and metaphorical storms
all weekend, the Michigan
women's golf team ended its
first home weekend in two years
on a positive note.
After a disappointing first
round Saturday that left them at
least seven strokes behind every
other team, the Wolverines
failed to climb out of last in
the next two rounds, posting
an improved second round in
stroke play before falling to
Miami in match play.
But on the fourth day, things
brightened up, as Michigan took
down Iowa to place seventh at
the East and West Match Play
Challenge.
"We dug ourselves in a pretty
big hole in that first round," said
Michigan coach Jan Dowling.
"But since then, we've played
some pretty solid golf. We didn't
come out on top or where we
wanted to, but the reason for
that, I'd say, is just a bunch of
little things."
With just two upperclassmen
on the roster, most of the
team hadn't competed at its
home course before. Any hint
of home-field advantage was
shattered in Saturday's opening
round, where the Wolverines
scored a 315 - 23 strokes off the
lead and seven worse than any
other team.
The Wolverines rebounded
nicely, shooting 297 later in the
day, but that wasn't enough to
move out of last place. In a field
that included four other Big

"The team wanted a 'little

Dowling said. "I like that fight
in them. It made it a lot of fun
watching today. There was a lot
of competitiveness, and I saw a
few fist pumps from our players
out there, playing hard for
themselves and for Michigan."
Despite the struggles on
paper, Dowling was pleased
with the raw skills her team
displayed over the weekend and
sees an opportunity to refine a
young and energetic core during
an upcoming three-week break.
"As far as ball striking goes
we're as good as any team,"
Dowling said. "For us, it's inside
100 yards and some - relatively
easy chip shots and short-
range shots where we gave
opportunities and strokes away.
There's always things to learn
every time you compete, so we
just have to get back at it."

The 2015 Michigan football
recruiting class is ranked 19th in
the nation by ESPN. While this
past weekend didn't pan out quite
like the Wolverines planned at
the Big House, the 2015 class had
some positive performances that
inspire optimism.
Here's a rundown of how 10 of
the current Michigan commits
fared this past weekend in their
high school games.

Old Farms (Conn.)vs. Brunswick
(Conn.); Ranking: ESPN (109)

an unsportsmanlike conduct,
penalty.
Darian Roseboro, defensive
tackle: Lincolnton (N.C.) vs. West
Lincoln (N.C.); Ranking: ESPN
(165) Scout (151)
Friday was a huge day for
Roseboro - he rushed 166 yards
with four touchdowns. With his
assistance, Lincolnton rushed for
100 yards as a team in the first
seven minutes of itshome opener.
Michael Weber, running
back: Cass Tech (Mich.) vs.
Detroit Douglass (Mich.);
Ranking: ESPN (169) Scout (104)
Weber did not play Friday due
to a toe injury he suffered two
weeks ago. Weber was also in

attendance at Michigan Stadium
on Saturday.
Tyree Kinnel, safety: Wayne
(Ohio) at Troy (Ohio); Ranking:
ESPN (192) Scout (152)
Kinnel made a huge impact on
special teams Friday. In Wayne's
54-0 win, he had a 69-yard punt
return for a touchdown.
Grant . Newsome, offensive
tackle: The Lawrenceville School
(N.J.) vs. Choate Rosemary
(Coon.); Ranking: ESPN (242)
Scout (215)
Lawrenceville's first regular-
season game featured a poor
performance by the entire
offensive line in a 37-0 loss.
Darrin Kirkland Jr.,
linebacker: Lawrence Central
(Ind.) at Pike (Ind.); Ranking:
ESPN (266) Scout (114)
Kirkland had another quiet
week at linebacker in Friday's
matchup, but Lawrence Central
improved to 2-3 on the year with
a 45-35 victory.
Alex Malzone, quarterback:
Birmingham Brother Rice
(Mich.) at Warren De La Salle
(Mich.); Ranking: ESPN (NR)
Scout (184)

game on Friday, completing 14 of
20 passes for 201 yards and three
touchdowns to lift Brother Rice
over De La Salle, 28-21.
Andrew David, kicker:
Washington (Ohio) vs. St. John's
(Ontario); Ranking: (NR)

from Canada on Friday, which
didn't prove to be a problem. The
Tigers won, 77-13, and improved
to 4-0 on the year.
Garrett Taylor, cornerback:

Decision day: Devin Gardner or Shane Morris?

Short-term risk
could result in long-
term reward
By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
ManagingSports Editor
Whether or not Devin
Gardner will remain the
Michigan football team's
quarterback in the upcoming
weeks will be decided Tuesday,
coach Brady Hoke said in
Monday's press conference.
The Wolverines are 0-2
against the Power 5 teams
they've faced, Notre Dame and
Utah. What's more, they didn't
enter the red zone - much less
score an offensive touchdown
- against either of those
opponents. And in those games,
Gardner has accounted for six
turnovers (five interceptions
and a fumble).
Meanwhile,sophomore Shane
Morris has no touchdowns
despite appearances in eight
games and a start in the 2013

Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl.
Don't expect a two-
quarterback system like the
Wolverines employed. late in
2012 with Gardner and Denard
Robinson. Hoke said the coaches
haven't considered platooning
under center.
Who should be Michigan's
starter? The Daily breaks down
the pros and cons ofbothoptions.
Devin Gardner, Fifth-year
senior
Anyone who can displace one
of the most electrifying players
in program history midway
through his redshirt sophomore
year is set up for being labeled a
bust.
And that's what happened
with Gardner. After he started
the year as wide receiver, an
injury to Robinson forced
Gardner to move back under
center. Behind him, the
Wolverines went 3-2 in their
last five games, picking up wins
over Minnesota, Northwestern
and Iowa, but falling in close

games to Ohio State and South
Carolina.
Gardner finished 2012 with
11 touchdowns and just five
interceptions, but that didn't
translate into a breakout
2013 season. Behind a porous
offensive line, Gardner tossed
11 picks, but the quarterback
rarely had

mistakes. Against Utah, he
missed receiver Devin Funchess
on an easy slant route, and he
was benched after throwing
a pass straight to a baiting'

year almost certainly can be In Nussmeier's system,

Doug Nussmeier's schemes. and his ability to create is also
But this fall, Gardner has being largely impaired.

Shane Morris, Sophomore
Anyone who argues that
a transition to Morris this
weekend would be seamless is
either lying or sorely mistaken.
Morris has seen meaningful
action just twice while at
Michigan. In last year's Buffalo
Wild Wings Bowl, he went
24-of-38 for 196 yards, but
many of his completions came
on passes behind the line of
scrimmage.
And upon relieving Gardner
on Saturday with about 10
minutes to play, Morris promptly
accounted for two turnovers
of his own, throwing an
interception and then fumbling.
So if Michigan does make
the switch to Morris, expect
some growing pains. Despite
Gardner's struggles, he has four
weeks of game experience under
Nussmeier and practiced as the
No. 1 quarterback throughout
the offseason. Morris has never
proven himself as a better game
manager than Gardner.

If there's one area in which
Morris holds a definitive edge
over Gardner, it's in his arm.
Saturday, the sophomore
uncorked a 60-yard rocket
while under pressure in his own
end zone. Meanwhile, Gardner
underthrew several wide-open
receivers all afternoon.
And Morris is no slouch on
his feet, either. He dashed for
40 yards against Kansas State
in December, the longest run
by any Wolverine last year. And
he has demonstrated similar
mobility in his action this fall.
Of course, many may prefer
Morris simply because he has
been touted as the future of the
program.
This is Gardner's last year,
and Michigan's coaches must
weigh the risk of starting an
unseasoned quarterback to the
reward of developing him into a
better player before next season.

RUBY WALLAU/Daily JAMES COLLER/Daily
Fifth-year senior Devin Gardner moved from his temporary position at wide receiver back to quarterback in 2012. Sophomore Shane Morris has a strong arm, but he's also turnover-prone and hasn't yet thrown a touchdown pass.

Mike Hadreas feeds
off of his enemies
on latest album
ByBRIAN BURLAGE
Daily Arts Writer
Mike Hadreas has spent the
last two years of his life exorcis-
ing his demons. An epic state-
ment he made
in July makes A
this fact very
clear: "Some- Too Bright
times I see
faces of blank Perfume
fear when I Genius
walk by ... if
these fucking Matador
people want
to give me some power - if
they see me as some sea witch
with penis tentacles that are
always prodding and poking
and seeking to convert the mug-
gles - well, here she comes."
The "muggles" that Hadreas
referred to are all the people
who, for reasons of their own,
propagate the gay panic in our
culture. They are the same
people who cast incendiary
gazes upon Hadreas wherever
he walks, who cannot come to
terms with his fierce noncon-
formity, and yet they are the
same people who give him his
sense of power.
Hadreas feeds off the confu-
sion of his enemies. He takes
their insults and disgust and
he transforms them into a
kind of self-sustaining vitality.
His first two albums, Learn-
ing and Put Your Back N 2 It,
perfectly display his cycling
vigor, his pent-up anger that
fuels the creativity of his spirit.
The albums consist of taut and
powerful songwriting, dis-
tinguished by an in-your-face
aggression that pop music has
contorted into folly in recent
years. Mike Hadreas is bent on
fixing that problem.
And so he has crafted an
album that strikes not with
the swing of its fist but with
the turning of its back. Too
Bright brings to a careful head
all the beauty and devastation
of Hadreas's personal battles.
He's decided that the surest
way to cleanse himself of past
trauma is to sing into.the faces
of his persecutors with such
sincerity, such directness of
heart, that silence becomes the
only appropriate response. So it

is: Too Bright ends in peaceful
silence.
A string of insecurities fol-
low Hadreas throughout the
album - his mother demand-
ing grandchildren despite her
knowledge of his sexual ori-
entation and boyfriend, indus-
try executives pushing him
to sacrifice his unique style
for the price of a mainstream
breakthrough, friends and col-
laborators harping on him for
more material. As a young kid,
Hadreas was diagnosed with
Crohn's disease, an affliction
of the gastrointestinal tract
that inflames and debilitates
organs. He was often sick and
pale, and his weight fluctu-
ated dramatically. Chief of all
his insecurities are those that
involve this issue - his body.
"If I could just be a lump, or
a mist of smoke with eyes, I
probably would be that - just
an energy, moving around," he
said in an interview with Pitch-
fork. Too Bright is grounded in
this same wish. His keen desire
to transcend the limits of his
body grows and develops into
pure-form frustration, which
he harnesses and reinvents
with masterful artistry.
Hadreas enlisted the help
of Portishead's instrumental
guru Adrian Utley, as well as
engineer Ali Chant and PJ Har-
vey's drummer John Parish, to
furnish his vision of ethereal
darkness. The group inhabits
a world of zigzagging synths,
saw-like guitars, electric pia-
nos that carve pleasing tones
into rock, smattering drum-
beats and reverberating vocals.
It's a world full of heartbreak
and rejection, and Hadreas
is finished with it. Too Bright
describes the journey of his
escape.
"Queen" emerges with splen-
did certitude, like the tip of
someone's finger landing some-
where on a spinning globe;
this is the "pop" aesthetic that
Hadreas has been aching to
achieve, and here he achieves
it in spades. Instead of masking
his self-consciousness, he heads
straight for its jugular. "Don't
you know your queen?" he asks
three separate times, each time
describing the broken-down,
tremulous nature of his body. It
doesn't matter if we recognize
it or not, he decides finally: "No
family is safe / When I sashay."
The terrible beauty of "Queen,"
and indeed the whole of Too

Bright, lies with Hadreas's
audacity to confront not only
the negative voices of his outer
world, but the negative voices
inside himself as well.
The arrangements here proj-
ect the power of several pop
icons onto more modern tastes
and styles. "Fool" - an entire
three act story in and of itself -
channels the catchy, hooky maj-
esty of Prince, only it's slowed
down a bit so we can bask in its
warmth. "My Body" mirrors
some of the darker minimalist
work of Bowie. Hadreas's voice
floats along softly just above a
whisper, that is, until devious
distortion kicks in and starts
to supply the right amount of
intensity. "Longpig" sounds
like it leapt out of an '80s exper-
imental pop anthology - glitzy,
repetitive, tuneful - picking up
the electro-rock fusion right
where Phil Collins left it.
But much of Too Bright's
sublime pathos is delivered
through its slower tracks,
where Hadreas unfurls him-
self in the space of airy glass
corridors, vanishing and reap-
pearing with mirage-like qual-
ity. For about a minute during
"I'm a Mother" we can hardly
understand what he's singing,
as though his words evaporate
before they leave his mouth.
But that doesn't diminish their
importance; rather, he" proves
with "No Good" that quiet
inward reflection can be just
as valuable a tool as outward
swagger, and as the track's fuse
burns away he purposefully
loses himself behind a swath of
lush piano. It's popcraft of the
highest order.
In the closing minute of the
album, Hadreas utters from
his heart what he knows to
be true: that his talent, his
determination, pride, self-
reliance and inner beauty
render all opposition futile. He
is strong. His cause is stronger.
He will continue to thrive and
inspire outcast groups with
or without our permission;
Too Bright is simply his latest
testimony. "I don't need your
love / I don't need your love /
I don't need you to understand
/ I need you to listen," he sings.
And as the song and the album
fade to a graceful close, we
come to the sudden realization
that by listening to Hadreas's
words, we have become a very
real and dangerous part of his
enterprise.

FILM REVIEW
Kline carries 'Old Lady'

By KARSTEN SMOLINSKI
Daily Arts Writer
Both charming and utterly
predictable, "My Old Lady" fol-
lows a failed, friendless writer as
he attempts to
clear his debts B-
by selling a
Parisian apart- My Old
ment inher-
ited from his Lady
father. Adapted The Michigan
from first-time
director Israel Theater
Horovitz's play BBCFilms
of the same
name, the film
follows an all-too-familiar pat-
tern of unraveling secrets and
dramatic confrontations. How-
ever, the excellent cast manages
just enough charisma to prevent
a complete tragedy.
In "My Old Lady," the shad-
ows of the past hang over the
main characters like a thick,
black fog. After 57 years, three
divorces and three unpublished
novels, Mathias Gold (Kevin
Kline, "Last Vegas") arrives in
Paris hoping that the sale of his
deceased father's apartment
will give him the fourth chance
he desperately needs. Unfortu-
nately for Mathias, he discov-
ers the 90-year-old Mathilde
Girard (Maggie Smith, "The
Best Exotic Marigold Hotel")
and her unmarried daughter
Chloe (Kristin Scott Thomas,
"The English Patient") living
there as part of a deal made
with his father under a strange
French property law.
While the deal itself is
poorly explained, the conflict
is clear: Mathias wants to sell
to a hotel owner who plans to
tear down the apartment com-
plex, while Mathilde and Chloei
wish to continue living in the
home that has been their fam-
ily's for generations. This spurs
Mathias's investigation of the
mysterious circumstances of
the arrangement, eventually
leading to the uncovering of
enough dirty family secrets
to fill three Greek tragedies.

FOX


WARNER BROS.
The strangest police line-up of all time.
Leave out the sch-maltz

lost touch with what made the
series so refreshing in its earlier
years. But "New Girl" is basical-
ly a new show at this point. Nick
and Jess are no longer a couple,
Schmidt isn't pining after Cece
anymore, Coach is back to liven
up the stale group dynamic. All
these changes could either point
toward a re-invigorated new era
for the show, or season three
could go down in history as the
year "New Girl" dropped off in
quality and predicted its own
demise.
"Last Wedding" simultane-
ously represents classic "New
Girl" and a version of the show
viewers have never seen before.
Jess (Zooey Deschanel, "(500)
Days of Summer") and the
gang are frustrated at having
to attend 11 weddings in one
summer, especially since none
of them is in a serious relation-
ship, and they've even managed
to miss out on the wonderful
array of hookups that weddings
could present. But the 12th wed-
ding has to be a special one -
as Schmidt (Max Greenfield,
"About Alex") points out, it's
the last chance to meet people
before sweaters and fall cloth-
ing make discerning a potential
date's figure nearly impossible
(obviously, this is what Ned
Stark really meant when he said
"winter is coming").
"New Girl" is at its best when
it throws all its characters into
one silly situation and doesn't
try for too elaborate or dramatic
a plot. A wedding hookup chal-
lenge, or "sex fist" as Jess calls
it (five friends joining together
to tear through the competition)
presents the perfect opportuni-
ty to spotlight the tenuous rela-
tionships between the friends

after the fallout of the third sea-
son.
Jess has her eye on hand-
some groomsman Ted (Reid
Scott, "Veep"), but miust vie for
his affections alongside a hyper-
competitive wedding attendee
(Jessica Biel, "Total Recall"),
Usually, an excess of guest stars
means that a show isn't confi-
dent enough in its supporting
characters to keep viewers tun-
ing in, but Scott and Biel's come-
dic chops put them a step above
simple stunt casting. Biel's char-
acter brings a self-conscious
and pathetic angle from Jess.
She's apparently the only one
of her roommates with a real
shot at bringing someone home,
but she's the second-best choice
of the two ladies pursuing
Ted. Winston (Lamorne Mor-
ris, "Dear Secret Santa") gives
her the advice of "Biden-ing"
Ted (that is, just following him
around until he basically just
has to pick her), but Jess is the
kind of girl who's used to being
picked first and having guys fall
in love with her at first sight.
After she's locked in the bath-
room, she muses to Nick (Jake
Johnson, "Drinking Buddies")
that maybe she's just meant to
be a "toilet person," and will
never have her own wedding
invitation decorating anybody's
fridge. It's a powerful moment,
or as powerful as a sitcom can be
- Nick and Jess wondering how
they ended up sitting on a toilet
together and why this isn't their
wedding.
Even Schmidt, who was so
sour and mean-spirited last sea-
son as to make him completely
unrelatable, was back to his
pleasantly preening and shallow
self. He and Nick have crushes
on two bridesmaids, but the
ladies only agree to spend the
night if they can all participate
in a foursome. It's impossible to
decide which is funnier: the fact
that Schmidt is so enthusiastic
to participate in group sex with
his roommate or that Nick is so
grumpy and hesitant. Thankful-
ly, Schmidt decides that Nick's
hoof-like hands are too unap-
pealing for romance, but the
buildup to that final confronta-
tion is easily the best part of the
episode. "New Girl" has built
an elaborate backstory between
Nick and Schmidt, but generally

doesn't explore their friendship
as much as some of the other
roommates. It's refreshing to see
that even in its fourth season,
"New Girl" is finding new rela-
tionships to mine for laughs, and
hopefully this episode is indica-
tive that Nick and Schmidt will
be sharing even more scenes
together.
"New Girl" still has its fair
share of problems - main-
ly, finding a place for Coach }
(Damon Wayans Jr., "Happy
Rndings") in the tangle of
friendships, and keeping Win-
ston relevant. Sadly, it's pretty
rare to see two Black characters
of the same gender in supporting
roles on the same TV show, and
if only "New Girl" could find a
way to incorporate both of them
more seamlessly into the narra-
tive, it'd be a stronger show. As it
stands, Winston sat in his chair
all night, offering the occcasional
advice or one-liner, but he barely
had a place in anyone's subplot.
Coach tried to play stud at the
wedding, but after word had
gotten around to all the ladies
in attendance that he wasn't
even in "The Best Man Holi-
day," it really hurt his game.
Nick and Schmidt's friendship
is so great, and it's baffling *
that "New Girl" hasn't even
occurred to afford Winston
and Coach a bromance on the
level of their costars.
FOX sitcom
needs to prove
itself in fourth
season.
The season premiere of
"New Girl" was a strong
comeback and showed the
post-breakup relationships
between all the characters in a
sophisticated way. The series -
still has a long way to go to
re-establish its place as one of
the best sitcoms on TV, but it's
making good progress by tak-
ing things slow and explore
the possibilities of relation-
ships between its characters.
Who knows - the sex fist may
be victorious yet.

Overcrowded cast
dilutes family
dramedy
ByNATALIEGADBOIS
SeniorArtsEditor
Screenwriters have taken to
heart Tolstoy's famous saying,
"All happy families are alike; each
unhappy fam-
ily is unhappy B
in its own way."
Dysfunctional This Is
family dram- Where I
edies hold a
niche market Leave You
in Hollywood, Rave 20 and
from "The Quality16
Family Stone" t
to "August: Warner Bros.
Osage County"
to "Little Miss Sunshine." These
movies appeal to audiences - they
make us laugh while reminding us
that everyone is a little screwed
up behind closed doors. "This Is
Where I Leave You," adapted from
Jonathan Tropper's 2009 bestsell-
ing novel, is no different. Starring
nearly every in-vogue actor from
both TV and film (Jason Bateman,
Tina Fey, Connie Britton, Adam
Driver, Rose Byrne and more) the
film is an enjoyable but forget-
table addition to the category, flit-
ting between relationships with
ease but failing to develop many
of the characters.
Led by matriarch Hillary Alt-
man (Jane Fonda, "Monster-in-
Law") the four grown Altman
siblings reunite under unfortu-
nate circumstances: the death of
their emotionally distant father.
His final request is that the fam-
ily sit Shiva (a Jewish ritual in
which the family must stay in

mourning for the seven days fol-
lowing his funeral). The siblings
are not pleased, harping insults
and complaints at each other that
teeter between funny and clum-
sily one-dimensional. Bateman
("Arrested Development") stars
as second brother Judd, bearded
and cynical after he catches his
wife cheating on him with his
boss, misogynist radio personal-
ity Wade Beaufort (Dax Shepard,
"Parenthood"). Bateman is exact-
ly what we've come to expect
from him; a quippy, restrained
Everyman. The shtick works, but
fails to graze Judd's depth in the
novel. .
Throwing in this many tal-
ented actors (from vastly dif-
ferent comedic and dramatic
backgrounds) can be dangerous.
Personalities can overwhelm
relationships until we don't see
a family so much as a group of
hysterical individuals. Thank-
fully, this is not the case in "This
is Where I Leave You."
While some performances are
stronger than others, the joy of
the film comes from the seeming-
ly organic interactions between
siblings. Fey ("30 Rock") and
Bateman demonstrate the unique
sibling ability of openly hating
and loving each other in equal
measure; though Fey struggles at
times to balance her tearful, dra-
matic moments with her come-
dic sharpness, their relationship
feels genuine. Similarly, Fonda
excels as their overbearing, over-
sharing psychologist mother. The
writing tends to rely too much
on her physical humor (i.e. the
gigantic fake breasts glued to her
chest), but she grounds the film as
the erratic but ultimately caring
center of the family. Her young-
est, Phillip, is played to exuber-

ant, irresponsible perfection by
Adam Driver ("Girls"), who is
setting himself up to be the next
great actor of our generation. And
the consistently flawless Connie
Britton ("Nashville") is surpris-
ingly well cast as his much older
fiance - she matches his selfish
dynamism with measured, well-
coiffed honesty.
Despite these successful pair-
ings, the film tends to fall into the
standard book-to-film adaptation
problems - too much plot and
too many characters are shoved
into a two-hour film, diluting the
significance of many scenes. As a
professed lover of the book, it was
often frustrating to see charac-
ters or scenes fall by the wayside
for lack of time - for example,
the normally transcendent Corey
Stoll ("House of Cards") was
wasted as eldest brother Paul,
who in the novel was brooding
and deeply emotional underneath
his stoic exterior. In the film, his
few lines register him as the stur-
dy and stodgy older brother, with
no real development beyond that.
Similarly, the pacing is often off,
clunkily hedging between slap-
stick and emotionally wrought
family moments. Tropper wrote
the adaptation himself, and at
times it feels as though he forgoes
the most interesting portions of
the book in favor of cliched movie
moments.
Though enjoyable, the film
doesn't live up to many of its fam-
ily dramedy movie predecessors
or the book it was based upon.
Perhaps it's the abundance of
television stars, or the comfort-
able suburban setting, but "This
Is Where I Leave You" feels more
like a sitcom than a movie, built
up with easy laughs and schmaltz
rather than real moments.
